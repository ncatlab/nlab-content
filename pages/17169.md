## Definition

Given a sequential [[spectrum]] $E$, in the form of a sequence of component spaces $E_n$ with structure maps $\Sigma E_n \to E_{n+1}$, then for $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ the $n$th _homotopy group_ of $E$ is the [[colimit]]

$$
  \pi_n(E) 
    \coloneqq 
  \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_k
  \pi_{n+k}(E_k)
$$

over the [[homotopy groups]] of the component spaces.

## Examples

* The homotopy groups of a [[suspension spectrum]] $\Sigma^\infty X$ of a [[pointed topological space]] $X$ are the _[[stable homotopy groups]]_ of $X$.

* In particular the homotopy groups of the [[sphere spectrum]] are the _[[stable homotopy groups of spheres]]_.

* [[Thom's theorem]] says that the homotopy groups of the [[Thom spectrum]] $M O$ form the (unoriented) [[cobordism ring]].
