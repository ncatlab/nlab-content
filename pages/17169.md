## Idea

Stable homotopy groups are [[homotopy groups]] as seen in [[stable homotopy theory]].

A [[morphism]] inducing an [[isomorphism]] on all stable homotopy groups is called a [[stable weak homotopy equivalence]].

## Definition

### For pointed topological spaces

Given a [[pointed topological space]] $X$, then its _stable homotopy groups_ are the [[colimit]] of ordinary [[homotopy groups]] of its [[reduced suspensions]]

$$
  \pi_n^S(X) \coloneqq \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_k \pi_{n+k}(\Sigma^k X)
  \,.
$$

### For sequential spectra

Given a  [[sequential spectrum]] $E$, in the form of a sequence of component spaces $E_n$ with structure maps $\Sigma E_n \to E_{n+1}$, then for $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ the $n$th _homotopy group_ of $E$ is the [[colimit]]

$$
  \pi_n(E) 
    \coloneqq 
  \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_k
  \pi_{n+k}(E_k)
$$

over the [[homotopy groups]] of the component spaces.

For sequential spectra in [[simplicial sets]], the same formula applies for the [[geometric realization]] of the component simplicial sets.


## Properties

For $E = \Sigma^\infty X$ the [[suspension spectrum]] of a [[pointed topological space]], we have

$$
  \pi_n^S(X) \simeq \pi_n(\Sigma^\infty X)
  \,.
$$

For $E$ a (weak) [[Omega spectrum]] then the colimit is attained:

$$
  \pi_n(E)
  \simeq
  \left\{
    \array{
      \pi_n(E_0) & for \; n \geq 0
      \\
      \pi_0(E_n) & for \;n \leq 0
    }
  \right.
$$

## Examples

* [[stable homotopy groups of spheres]]

* [[Thom's theorem]]

## Related concepts

* [[homotopy group]]

* [[free infinite loop space]]

* [[equivariant homotopy group]]


## Examples

* The homotopy groups of a [[suspension spectrum]] $\Sigma^\infty X$ of a [[pointed topological space]] $X$ are the _[[stable homotopy groups]]_ of $X$.

* In particular the homotopy groups of the [[sphere spectrum]] are the _[[stable homotopy groups of spheres]]_.

* [[Thom's theorem]] says that the homotopy groups of the [[Thom spectrum]] $M O$ form the (unoriented) [[cobordism ring]].
