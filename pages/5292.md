###### Definition

The **framed little 2-disk operad** is the [[operad]] $P$ in [[Top]] whose [[topological space]] $P(n)$ of $n$-ary operations is the space of maps

$$
  \coprod_n D \to D
$$

from $n$-copies of the 2-[[ball]] to itself, which restrict on each component to a map that is a combination of 

* a translation

* a dilatation

* a rotation

of the disk (regarded via its standard [[embedding]] $D \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ into the 2-simensional [[Cartesian space]]) such that the images of all disks are disjoint.

+-- {: .un_remark}
###### Remark

This differs from the [[little 2-disk operad]] by the fact that rotations of the disks are admitted. Under passing to chains and then to [[homology]], this operation gives rise to the BV-operator in a [[BV-algebra]]. See [Properties](#Properties) below.

###### Theorem

The [[homology]] of the framed little 2-disk operad in chain complexes is the operad for [[BV-algebra]]s.

This is due to ([Getzler](#Getzler)).

###### Definition

Write $R \beta_j$ for the [[ribbon braid group]] on $j$ elements and $P R \beta_j$ for the [[kernel]] of the surjection $R \beta_j \to \Sigma_j$ onto the [[symmetric group]].

Say that a [[ribbon operad]] $P$ is an **$R_\infty$-operad** if the [[ribbon braid group]]s  act freely and properly on $P$ and if each [[topological space]] $P(k)$ is [[contractible]].

=--

+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Theorem


If $P$ is an $R_\infty$-operad, then the sequence of quotient spaces $\{P(n)/P R \beta_n\}$  forms a symmetric operad equivalent to the frame little disks operad.

=--

This is ([Wahl, lemma 1.5.17](#Wahl)).
