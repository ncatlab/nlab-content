## Overview

To recall, the subject of [[topology]] studies [[spaces]] with [[continuous functions]] between them: [[topological spaces]], a fundamental concept in all of [[mathematics]]. For many applications one cares about the choice of [[continuous functions]] only up to continuous [[deformations]], called [[homotopies]]. The study of [[topological spaces]] with [[continuous functions]] up to [[homotopy]] is called [[homotopy theory]]. Interestingly, this plays an even more fundamental role in [[mathematics]]. For some introductory exposition see at _[[schreiber:Higher Structures in Mathematics and Physics]]_.

In order to study [[topological spaces]] up to [[homotopy]] -- then called _[[homotopy types]]_ -- a useful strategy is to assign [[algebra|algebraic]] data to them which may be transferred along [[continuous functions]] but is [[invariant]] under [[homotopy]]: _[[homotopy invariants]]_. This approach to [[homotopy theory]] is called _[[algebraic topology]]_.

A basic example of such a [[homotopy invariant]] of [[topological spaces]] is [[singular homology]] and [[singular cohomology]]. These  are sequences of [[abelian groups]] which classify formal [[formal linear combinations]] of "[[singular chains]]" in a topological space, essentially a simple algebraic way to detect which kind of "holes" there are in a [[topological space]].

But there are more interesting and richer [[homotopy invariants]] of [[topological spaces]]. In a sense the next example after the "[[ordinary cohomology|ordinary]]" [[singular cohomology]] is the "[[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology|generalized cohomology theory]]" called [[topological K-theory]].

In [[topological K-theory]] one detects properties of [[topological spaces]] by regarding _[[vector bundles]]_ over them. A [[vector bundle]] over a topological space $X$ is an assignment of a [[vector space]] $V_x$ (the "[[fiber]]" over $x$) to each of its points, such that these glue together to one big space $V$ over $X$ as the point $x$ varies in $X$. Hence vector bundles are to be thought of as "continuously varying families of vector spaces", combining [[topology]] with [[linear algebra]].

For example if $X$ is [[differentiation|differentiable]], then at each of its points there is a [[vector space]] of _[[tangent vectors]]_ called the [[tangent space]] at that point. The collection of these [[tangent spaces]] forms a [[vector bundle]] called the _[[tangent bundle]]_. The graphics on the right shows one tangent space to the [[2-sphere]].


Just as two [[vector spaces]] may be combined in their [[direct sum]], so two [[vector bundles]] may be combined by point-wise direct sum of their [[fibers]]. This makes the vector bundles over a fixed topological space form a [[semi-group]] (in fact a [[monoid]]). This may universally be turned into an [[abelian group]], and this is the [[topological K-theory]] group of the underlying topological space. Hence

+-- {: principle}

_[[topological K-theory|Topological K-theory]] studies [[vector bundles]] over [[topological spaces]] together with their formal [[inverses]] with respect to [[direct sum of vector bundles]]_.

=--


$\,$

We now say some of this again, at a slightly more technical level.

$\,$


Recall that for $k$ a [[field]] then a $k$-[[vector bundle]] over a [[topological space]] $X$ is a map $V \to X$ whose [[fibers]] are [[vector spaces]] which vary over $X$ in a controlled way. Explicitly this means that there exits an [[open cover]] $\{U_i \to X\}$ of $X$, a [[natural number]] $n \in \mathbb{N}$ (the _[[rank of a vector bundle|rank]]_ of the vector bundle) and a [[homeomorphism]] $U_i \times k^n \to V|_{U_i}$ over $U_i$ which is fiberwise a $k$-[[linear map]].

Vector bundles are of central interest in large parts of [[mathematics]] and [[physics]], for instance in [[Chern-Weil theory]] and [[cobordism theory]]. But the collection $Vect(X)_{/\sim}$ of [[isomorphism classes]] of vector bundles over a given space is in general hard to analyze. One reason for this is that these are classified in degree-1 _[[nonabelian cohomology]]_ with [[coefficients]] in the ([[nonabelian group|nonabelian]]) [[general linear group]] $GL(n,k)$. K-theory may roughly be thought of as the result of forcing vector bundles to be classified by an abelian [[cohomology theory]].

To that end, observe that all natural operations on [[vector spaces]] generalize to vector bundles by applying them [[fiber]]-wise. Notably there is the fiberwise [[direct sum of vector bundles]], also called the _[[Whitney sum]]_ operation. This operation gives the set $Vect(X)_{/\sim}$ of [[isomorphism classes]] of vector bundles the structure of an [[semi-group]] ([[monoid]]) $(Vect(X)_{/\sim},\oplus)$.

Now as under direct sum, the [[dimension]] of vector spaces adds, similarly under [[direct sum of vector bundles]] their [[rank]] adds.  Hence in analogy to how one passes from the  additive [[semi-group]] ([[monoid]]) of  [[natural numbers]] to the addtitive [[group]] of [[integers]] by adjoining formal additive inverses, so one may adjoin formal additive inverses to $(Vect(X)_{/\sim},\oplus)$. By a general prescription ("[[Grothendieck group]]") this is achieved by first passing to the larger class of [[pairs]] $(V_+,V_-)$ of vector bundles ("[[virtual vector bundles]]"), and then [[quotient|quotienting]] out the [[equivalence relation]] given by

$$
  (V_+, V_-) \sim (V_+ \oplus W , V_- \oplus W)
$$

for all $W \in Vect(X)_{/\sim}$. The resulting set of [[equivalence classes]] is an [[abelian group]] with group operation given on representatives by

$$
  [V_+, V_-] \oplus [V'_+, V'_-] \coloneqq (V_+ \oplus V'_+, V_- \oplus V'_-)
$$

and with the [[inverse]] of $[V_+,V_-]$ given by

$$
  -[V_+, V_-] = [V_-, V_+]
  \,.
$$

This [[abelian group]] obtained from $(Vect(X)_{/\sim}, \oplus)$ is denoted $K(X)$ and often called _the K-theory_ of the space $X$. Here the letter "K" (due to [[Alexander Grothendieck]]) originates as a shorthand for the German word _Klasse_, referring to the above process of forming [[equivalence classes]] of ([[isomorphism classes]]) of vector bundles.

This simple construction turns out to yield remarkably useful groups of [[homotopy]] [[invariants]].
A variety of deep facts in [[algebraic topology]] have fairly elementary proofs in terms of topolgical K-theory, for instance the [[Hopf invariant one]] problem ([Adams-Atiyah 66](#AdamsAtiyah66)).

One defines the "higher" K-groups of a topological space to be those of its higher [[suspensions]]

$$
  K^{-n}(X) = K(\Sigma^n X)
  \,.
$$

The assignment $X \mapsto K^\bullet(X)$ turns out to share many properties of the assignment of [[ordinary cohomology]] groups $X \mapsto H^n(X,\mathbb{Z})$. One says that topological K-theory is a [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] theory. As such it is [[Brown representability theorem|represented]] by a [[spectrum]]. For $k = \mathbb{C}$ this is called [[KU]], for $k = \mathbb{R}$ this is called [[KO]]. (There is also the unification of both in [[KR]]-theory.)

One of the basic facts about topological K-theory, rather unexpected from the definition, is that these higher K-groups repeat _periodically_ in the degree $n$. For $k = \mathbb{R}$ the periodicity is 8, for $k = \mathbb{C}$ it is 2. This is called _[[Bott periodicity]]_.


It turns out that an important source of [[virtual vector bundles]] representing classes in [[K-theory]] are index bundles: Given a [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian]] [[spin structure|spin]] [[manifold]] $B$, then there is a [[vector bundle]] $S \to B$ called the _[[spin bundle]]_ of $B$, which carries a [[differential operator]], called the [[Dirac operator]] $D$. The [[index of a Dirac operator]] is the formal difference of its [[kernel]] by its [[cokernel]] $[ker D, coker D]$. Now given a continuous family $D_x$ of Dirac operators/Fredholm operators, parameterized by some topological space $X$, then these indices combine to a class in $K(X)$.

It is via this construction that topological K-theory connects to [[spin geometry]] (see e.g. [[Karoubi K-theory]]) and [[index theory]].

As the terminology indicates, both [[spin geometry]] and [[Dirac operator]] originate in [[physics]]. Accordingly, K-theory plays a central role in various areas of [[mathematical physics]], for instance in the theory of [[geometric quantization]] ("[[spin^c quantization]]") in the theory of [[D-branes]] (where it models [[D-brane charge]] and [[RR-fields]]) and in the theory of [[Kaluza-Klein compactification]] via [[spectral triples]] (see below).

All these geometric constructions have an [[operator algebra|operator algebraic]] incarnation: by the topological [[Serre-Swan theorem]] then [[vector bundles]] of finite rank are equivalently [[modules]] over the [[C*-algebra]] of [[continuous functions]] on the base space. Using this relation one may express K-theory classes entirely operator algebraically, this is called _[[operator K-theory]]_. Now [[Dirac operators]] are generalized to [[Fredholm operators]].

There are more [[C*-algebras]] than arising as [[algebras of functions]] of [[topological space]], namely non-commutative C*-algebras. One may think of these as defining [[non-commutative geometry]], but the definition of [[operator K-theory]] immediately generalizes to this situation (see also at _[[KK-theory]]_).

While the [[C*-algebra]] of a [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian]] [[spin structure|spin]] [[manifold]] remembers only the underlying [[topological space]], one may algebraically encode the [[smooth structure]] and [[Riemannian structure]] by passing from [[Fredholm modules]] to "[[spectral triples]]". This may for instance be used to algebraically encode the spin physics underlying the [[standard model of particle physics]] and [[operator K-theory]] plays a crucial role in this.


## **Ordinary cohomology**

This section serves as warmup and for background. Since the [[topological K-theory]] that we are after may be seen as a higher analog of [[ordinary cohomology]], we first recall [[ordinary cohomology]].

induced under the coordinate presentation of def. \ref{TopologicalSimplex},
by the inclusion

$$
  \mathbb{R}^n \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n+1}
$$

which "omits" the $k$th canonical coordinate:

$$
  (x_0, \cdots , x_{n-1}) \mapsto (x_0, \cdots, x_{k-1} , 0 , x_{k}, \cdots, x_{n-1})

of the "right" end of the standard interval. The other inclusion

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $0 \leq k \lt n$ the **$k$th degenerate $(n)$-simplex (projection)** is the surjective map

$$
  \sigma_k : \Delta^{n} \to \Delta^{n-1}
$$

induced under the barycentric coordinates of def. \ref{TopologicalSimplex} under the surjection

$$
  \mathbb{R}^{n+1} \to \mathbb{R}^n

which sends

###### Definition

For $X \in $ [[Top]]  and $n \in \mathbb{N}$, a **singular $n$-simplex** in $X$ is a [[continuous map]]

$$
  \sigma : \Delta^n \to X
$$

from the topological $n$-simplex, def. \ref{TopologicalSimplex}, to $X$.

Write

###### Definition

For $f,g : X \to Y$ two [[continuous functions]] between
[[topological spaces]], a **[[left homotopy]]** $\eta : f \Rightarrow g$ is a [[commuting diagram]] in [[Top]] of the form

$$
  \array{

###### Remark

In words this says that a homotopy between two continuous functions $f$ and $g$ is a continuous 1-parameter deformation of $f$ to $g$. That deformation parameter is the canonical [[coordinate]] along the interval $[0,1]$, hence along the "length" of the [[cylinder]] $X \times \Delta^1$.

###### Definition

For $X$ a [[topological space]] and $x : * \to X$ a [[point]]. A [[loop space|loop]] in $X$ based at $x$ is a [[continuous function]]

$$
  \gamma : \Delta^1  \to X
$$

from the topological 1-[[simplex]], such that $\gamma(0) = \gamma(1) = x$.

A _based [[homotopy]]_ between two loops is a [[homotopy]]

The [[homotopy theory]] of topological spaces is all controled by the following notion. The [[abelianization]] of this notion, the notion of _[[quasi-isomorphism]]_ discussed in def. \ref{QuasiIsos} below is central to homological algebra.

+-- {: .num_defn #WeakHomotopyEquivalence}
###### Definition

For $X, Y \in $ [[Top]] two [[topological spaces]], a [[continuous function]]  $f : X \to Y$ between them is called a **[[weak homotopy equivalence]]** if

1. $f$ induces an [[isomorphism]] of [[connected components]]

   $$
     \pi_0(f) \colon \pi_0(X) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} \pi_0(Y)
   $$

   in [[Set]];

1. for all [[points]] $x \in X$ and for all $(1 \leq n) \in \mathbb{N}$ $f$ induces an isomorphism on [[homotopy groups]]

   $$
     \pi_n(f,x) \colon \pi_n(X,x) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} \pi_n(Y,f(x))
   $$

   in [[Grp]].

=--

What is called _[[homotopy theory]]_ is  effectively the study of topological spaces not up to [[isomorphism]] (here: [[homeomorphism]]), but up to [[weak homotopy equivalence]]. Similarly, we will see that homological algebra is effectively the study of [[chain complexes]] not up to [[isomorphism]], but up to [[quasi-isomorphism]]. But this is slightly more subtle than it may seem, in parts due to the following:

+-- {: .num_prop #ReflexiveAndTransitiveButNotSymmetric}
###### Proposition

The existence of a weak homotopy equivalence from $X$ to $Y$ is a [[reflexive relation|reflexive]] and [[transitive relation]] on [[Top]], but it is not a  [[symmetric relation]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Reflexivity and transitivity are trivially checked. A counterexample to symmetry
is the weak homotopy equivalence between the stanard [[circle]] and the [[pseudocircle]].

=--

But we can consider the genuine equivalence relation _generated_ by weak homotopy equivalence:

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

We say two spaces $X$ and $Y$ have the same **(weak) [[homotopy type]]** if they are equivalent under the [[equivalence relation]] _generated_ by weak homotopy equivalence.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

Equivalently this means that $X$ and $Y$ have the same (weak) homotopy type
if there exists a [[zigzag]] of weak homotopy equivalences

$$
  X \leftarrow \to\leftarrow \dots \to Y
  \,.
$$

=--


One can understand the [[homotopy type]] of a topological space just in terms of its [[homotopy groups]] and how they [[action|act]] on each other. (This data is called a [[Postnikov tower]] of $X$.) But computing and handling homotopy groups is in general hard, famously so already for the seemingly simple case of the _[[homotopy groups of spheres]]_. Therefore we now want to simplify the situation by passing to a "linear/abelian approximation".



### Simplicial and singular homology
 {#SimplicialHomology}

This section discusses how the "abelianization" of a topological space by _[[singular chains]]_ gives rise to the notion of _[[chain complexes]]_ and their _[[homology]]_.

Above in def. \ref{SingularSimplex} we saw that to a [[topological space]] $X$ is associated a sequence of sets

$$
  (Sing X)_n \coloneqq Hom_{Top}(\Delta^n, X)
$$

of [[singular simplices]]. Since the topological $n$-simplices $\Delta^n$ from def. \ref{TopologicalSimplex} sit inside each other by the face inclusions of def. \ref{FaceInclusionInBarycentricCoords}

$$
  \delta_k : \Delta^{n-1} \to \Delta^{n}
$$

and project onto each other by the degeneracy maps, def. \ref{DegeneracyProjectionsInBarycentricCoords}

$$
  \sigma_k : \Delta^{n+1} \to \Delta^n
$$

we dually have functions

$$
  d_k \coloneqq Hom_{Top}(\delta_k, X) : (Sing X)_n \to (Sing X)_{n-1}
$$

that send each singular $n$-simplex to its $k$-face and functions

$$
  s_k \coloneqq Hom_{Top}(\sigma_k,X) : (Sing X)_{n} \to (Sing X)_{n+1}
$$

that regard an $n$-simplex as beign a degenerate ("thin") $(n+1)$-simplex.
All these sets of simplices and face and degeneracy maps between them form the following structure.

+-- {: .num_defn #SimplicialSet}
###### Definition

A **[[simplicial set]]** $S \in sSet$ is

* for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ a [[set]] $S_n \in Set$ -- the **set of $n$-[[simplices]]**;

* for each [[injective map]] $\delta_i : \overline{n-1} \to \overline{n}$ of [[totally ordered sets]] $\bar n \coloneqq \{ 0 \lt 1 \lt \cdots \lt n \}$

  a [[function]] $d_i : S_{n} \to S_{n-1}$ -- the $i$th **face map** on $n$-simplices;

* for each [[surjective map]] $\sigma_i : \overline{n+1} \to \bar n$ of [[totally ordered sets]]

  a [[function]] $\sigma_i : S_{n} \to S_{n+1}$ -- the $i$th **degeneracy map** on $n$-simplices;

such that these functions satisfy the _[[simplicial identities]]_.

It is straightforward to check by explicit inspection that the evident injection and restriction maps between the sets of [[singular simplices]] make $(Sing X)_\bullet$ into a simplicial set. We now briefly indicate a systematic way to see this using basic [[category theory]], but the reader already satisfied with this statement should jump ahead to the abelianization of $(Sing X)_n$ in prop. \ref{FreeAbelianGroup} below.

###### Definition

The **[[simplex category]]** $\Delta$ is the [[full subcategory]] of [[Cat]] on the free categories of the form

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    [0] & \coloneqq \{0\}
    \\
    [1] & \coloneqq \{0 \to 1\}
    \\
   [2] & \coloneqq \{0 \to 1 \to 2\}
   \\
   \vdots
   \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

This is called the "simplex category" because we are to think of the object $[n]$ as being the "[[spine]]" of the $n$-[[simplex]]. For instance for $n = 2$ we think of $0 \to 1 \to 2$ as the "spine" of the triangle. This becomes clear if we don't just draw the morphisms that _generate_ the category $[n]$, but draw also all their composites. For instance for $n = 2$ we have_

$$
  [2]
  =
  \left\{
  \array{
     && 1
     \\
     & \nearrow && \searrow
     \\
    0 &&\to&& 2
  }

###### Proposition

A [[functor]]

$$
  S : \Delta^{op} \to Set
$$

from the [[opposite category]] of the [[simplex category]] to the category [[Set]] of sets is canonically identified with a [[simplicial set]], def. \ref{SimplicialSet}.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

One checks by inspection that the simplicial identities
characterize precisely the behaviour of the morphisms in
$\Delta^{op}([n],[n+1])$ and $\Delta^{op}([n],[n-1])$.

=--

This makes the following evident:

+-- {: .num_example #StandardCosimplicialTopologicalSpace}
###### Example

The [[topological simplices]] from def. \ref{TopologicalSimplex} arrange into a _[[cosimplicial object]] in [[Top]]_, namely a [[functor]]

$$
  \Delta^\bullet : \Delta \to Top
  \,.
$$

=--

With this now the structure of a simplicial set on the singular simplices $(Sing X)_\bullet$, def. \ref{SingularSimplex}, is manifest: it is just the _[[nerve]]_ of $X$ with respect to $\Delta^\bullet$, namely:

+-- {: .num_defn #SingularSimplicialComplex}
###### Definition

For $X$ a [[topological space]] its **[[singular simplicial complex|simplicial set of singular simplicies]]**  (often called the **[[singular simplicial complex]]**)

$$
  (Sing X)_\bullet : \Delta^{op} \to Set
$$

is given by composition of the functor from example \ref{StandardCosimplicialTopologicalSpace} with the [[hom functor]] of [[Top]]:

$$
  (Sing X) : [n] \mapsto Hom_{Top}( \Delta^n , X )
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark (aside)

It turns out that [[homotopy type]] of the topological space $X$ is entirely captured by its singular simplicial complex $Sing X$ (this is the content of the _[[homotopy hypothesis]]-theorem_).

=--

Now we [[abelian group|abelianize]] the singular simplicial complex $(Sing X)_\bullet$ in order to make it _simpler_ and hence more tractable.


+-- {: .num_defn #FormalLinearCombination}
###### Definition

A **formal linear combination** of elements of a [[set]]
$S \in $ [[Set]] is a [[function]]

$$
  a : S \to \mathbb{Z}
$$

such that only finitely many of the values $a_s \in \mathbb{Z}$ are non-zero.

Identifying an element $s \in S$ with the function
$S \to \mathbb{Z}$, which sends $s$ to $1 \in \mathbb{Z}$ and all other elements to 0, this is written as

$$
  a = \sum_{s \in S} a_s \cdot s
  \,.
$$

In this expression one calls $a_s \in \mathbb{Z}$ the [[coefficient]] of $s$ in the formal linear combination.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #GroupOfFormalLinearCombinations}
###### Remark

For $S \in $ [[Set]], the **group of formal linear combinations** $\mathbb{Z}[S]$ is the [[group]] whose underlying [[set]] is that of formal linear combinations,
def. \ref{FormalLinearCombination}, and whose group operation is
the pointwise addition in $\mathbb{Z}$:

$$
  (\sum_{s \in S} a_s \cdot s)
  +
  (\sum_{s \in S} b_s \cdot s)
  =
  \sum_{s \in S} (a_s + b_s) \cdot s
  \,.
$$

For the present purpose the following statement may be regarded as just introducing different terminology for the group of formal linear combinations:

+-- {: .num_prop #FreeAbelianGroup}
###### Proposition

The group $\mathbb{Z}[S]$ is the **[[free abelian group]]** on $S$.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

For $S_\bullet$ a [[simplicial set]], def. \ref{SimplicialSet}, the free abelian group $\mathbb{Z}[S_n]$ is called the group of (simplicial) **$n$-chains** on $S$.

=--

###### Definition

For $X$ a [[topological space]], an $n$-chain on the [[singular simplicial complex]] $Sing X$ is called a **singular $n$-chain** on $X$.

This construction makes the sets of simplices into abelian groups. But this allows to _formally add_ the different face maps in the simplicial set to one single boundary map:

+-- {: .num_defn #TheAlternatingFaceMapDifferential}
###### Definition

For $S$ a [[simplicial set]], its **alternating face map differential** in degree $n$ is the linear map

$$
  \partial : \mathbb{Z}[S_n] \to \mathbb{Z}[S_{n-1}]
$$

defined on [[basis]] elements $\sigma \in S_n$ to be the alternating sum of the simplicial face maps:

\[
  \label{AlternatingFaceMapDifferential}
  \partial \sigma \coloneqq \sum_{k = 0}^n (-1)^k d_k \sigma
  \,.
\]

=--

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

The simplicial identity, def. \ref{SimplicialIdentities} part (1), implies that the alternating sum boundary map of def. \ref{TheAlternatingFaceMapDifferential} squares to 0:

$$
  \partial \circ \partial = 0
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By linearity, it is sufficient to check this on a basis element $\sigma \in S_n$. There we compute as follows:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \partial \partial \sigma
    & =
    \partial \left(
      \sum_{j = 0}^n (-1)^j d_j \sigma
    \right)
    \\
    & =
    \sum_{j=0}^n \sum_{i = 0}^{n-1} (-1)^{i+j} d_i d_j \sigma
    \\
     & =
     \sum_{0 \leq i \lt j \leq n} (-1)^{i+j} d_i d_j \sigma
     +
     \sum_{0 \leq j \leq i \lt n} (-1)^{i + j} d_i d_j \sigma
     \\
     & =
     \sum_{0 \leq i \lt j \leq n} (-1)^{i+j} d_{j-1} d_i \sigma
     +
     \sum_{0 \leq j \leq i \lt n} (-1)^{i + j} d_i d_j \sigma
     \\
     & =
     -
     \sum_{0 \leq i \leq j \lt n} (-1)^{i+j} d_{j} d_i \sigma
     +
     \sum_{0 \leq j \leq i \lt n} (-1)^{i + j} d_i d_j \sigma
     \\
     & = 0
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

Here

1. the first equality is (eq:AlternatingFaceMapDifferential);

1. the second is (eq:AlternatingFaceMapDifferential) together with the linearity of $d$;

1. the third is obtained by decomposing the sum into two summands;

1. the fourth finally uses the simplicial identity def. \ref{SimplicialIdentities} (1) in the first summand;

1. the fifth relabels the summation index $j$ by $j +1$;

1. the last one observes that the resulting two summands are negatives of each other.

+-- {: .num_example #BasicExamplesOfChainBoundaries}
###### Example

Let $X$ be a topological space. Let $\sigma^1 : \Delta^1 \to X$
be a singular 1-simplex, regarded as a 1-chain

$$
  \sigma^1 \in C_1(X)
  \,.
$$

Then its [[boundary]] $\partial \sigma \in H_0(X)$ is

$$
  \partial \sigma^1 = \sigma(0)  -\sigma(1)
$$

or graphically (using notation as for [[orientals]])

$$
  \partial
  \left(
    \sigma(0) \stackrel{\sigma}{\to} \sigma(1)
  \right)
  =
  (\sigma(0)) - (\sigma(1))
  \,.
$$

In particular $\sigma$ is a 1-[[cycle]] precisely if $\sigma(0) = \sigma(1)$, hence precisely if $\sigma$ is a [[loop space|loop]].

Let $\sigma^2 : \Delta^2 \to X$ be a singular 2-chain. The boundary is

$$
  \partial
  \left(
    \array{
       && \sigma(1)
       \\
       & {}^{\mathllap{\sigma(0,1)}}\nearrow
       & \Downarrow^{\mathrlap{\sigma}}&
       \searrow^{\mathrlap{\sigma^{1,2}}}
       \\
       \sigma(0) &&\underset{\sigma(0,2)}{\to}&& \sigma(2)
    }
  \right)
  =
  \left(
    \array{
       && \sigma(1)
       \\
       & {}^{\mathllap{\sigma(0,1)}}\nearrow

       \\

###### Definition

A _[[chain complex]] of [[abelian groups]]_ $C_\bullet$ is a collection
$\{C_n \in Ab\}_{n}$ of abelian groups together with group homomorphisms $\{\partial_n : C_{n+1} \to C_n\}$ such that $\partial \circ \partial = 0$.

We turn to this definition in more detail in the [next section](#CategoriesOfChainComplexes). The thrust of this construction lies in the fact that the chain complex $C_\bullet(Sing X)$ remembers the [[abelianization|abelianized]] [[fundamental group]] of $X$, as well as aspects of the higher [[homotopy groups]]: in its _[[chain homology]]_.

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

For $C_\bullet(S)$ a chain complex as in def. \ref{ComplexOfChainsOnASimplicialSet}, and for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ we say

* a [[chain]] $\sigma \in C_n(S)$ is an **$n$-[[cycle]]** if $\partial \sigma = 0$

  (every 0-chain is a 0-cycle).

By linearity of $\partial$ the boundaries and cycles form abelian sub-groups of the group of chains, and we write

$$
  B_n \coloneqq im(\partial_n) \subset C_n(S)
$$

for the group of $n$-boundaries, and

$$
  Z_n \coloneqq ker(\partial_n) \subset C_(S)

for the group of $n$-cycles.

$H_n(C(S)) \in Ab$ is the [[quotient group]]

$$

of the $n$-[[cycles]] by the $n$-[[boundaries]] -- where for $n = 0$ we declare that $\partial_{-1} \coloneqq 0$ and hence $Z_0 \coloneqq C_0$.

Specifically, the [[chain homology]] of $C_\bullet(Sing X)$ is called the **[[singular homology]]** of the [[topological space]] $X$.

For $X$ a [[topological space]] we have that the degree-0 singular homology

###### Definition

Given a [[continuous map]] $f : X \to Y$ between [[topological spaces]],

$$
  f_* \sigma : \Delta^n \stackrel{\sigma}{\to} X \stackrel{f}{\to} Y

in $Y$. This is called the **push-forward** of $\sigma$ along $f$. Accordingly there is a push-forward map on groups of singular chains

###### Definition

For $C_\bullet, D_\bullet$ two [[chain complexes]], def. \ref{ChainComplexes}, a [[homomorphism]] between them -- called a **[[chain map]]** $f_\bullet : C_\bullet \to D_\bullet$  -- is for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ a homomorphism $f_n : C_n \to D_n$ of abelian groups, such that $f_n \circ \partial^C_n = \partial^D_n \circ f_{n+1}$:

Composition of such chain maps is given by degreewise composition of their components. Clearly, chain complexes with chain maps between them hence form a [[category]] -- the _[[category of chain complexes]]_ in [[abelian groups]], --  which we write

###### Proposition

Sending a topological space to its singular chain complex $C_\bullet(X)$, def. \ref{ComplexOfChainsOnASimplicialSet}, and a continuous map to its push-forward chain map,
prop. \ref{PushForwardChainMap}, constitutes a [[functor]]

$$
  C_\bullet(-) : Top \to Ch_\bullet(Ab)

from the category [[Top]] of topological spaces and continuous maps, to the [[category of chain complexes]].

In particular for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ singular homology extends to a [[functor]]

We close this section by stating the basic properties of [[singular homology]], which make precise the sense in which it is an abelian approximation to the [[homotopy type]] of $X$. The proof of these statements requires some of the tools of homological algebra that we develop in the later chapters, as well as some tools in [[algebraic topology]].

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

If $f : X \to Y$ is a [[continuous map]] between [[topological spaces]] which is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]], def, \ref{WeakHomotopyEquivalence}, then the induced morphism on singular homology groups

$$
  H_n(f) : H_n(X) \to H_n(Y)
$$

is an [[isomorphism]].

=--

(A proof (via [[CW approximations]]) is spelled out for instance in ([Hatcher, prop. 4.21](#Hatcher))).

We therefore also have an "abelian analog" of weak homotopy equivalences:

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

For $C_\bullet, D_\bullet$ two [[chain complexes]],
a [[chain map]] $f_\bullet : C_\bullet \to D_\bullet$ is called a **[[quasi-isomorphism]]** if it induces [[isomorphisms]] on all [[homology groups]]:

$$
  f_n : H_n(C) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} H_n(D)
  \,.
$$


=--

In summary: **chain homology sends [[weak homotopy equivalences]] to [[quasi-isomorphisms]]**. Quasi-isomorphisms of chain complexes are the abelianized analog of weak homotopy equivalences of topological spaces.

In particular we have the analog of prop. \ref{ReflexiveAndTransitiveButNotSymmetric}:

The [[relation]] "There exists a [[quasi-isomorphism]] from $C_\bullet$ to $D_\bullet$." is a [[reflexive relation|reflexive]] and [[transitive relation]], but it is not a [[symmetric relation]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Reflexivity and transitivity are evident. An explicit counter-example
showing the non-symmetry is the [[chain map]]

$$
  \array{
     \cdots &\to& 0 &\to& \mathbb{Z} &\stackrel{\cdot 2}{\to}& \mathbb{Z} &\to& 0 &\to& \cdots
     \\
     \cdots && \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow && \cdots
     \\
     \cdots &\to& 0 &\to& 0 &\to& \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} &\to& 0 &\to& \cdots
  }
$$

from the chain complex concentrated on the morphism of multiplication by 2 on integers, to the chain complex concentrated on the [[cyclic group of order 2]].


This clearly induces an isomorphism on all homology groups. But there is not even a non-zero chain map in the other direction, since there is no non-zero group homomorphism $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}$.

=--

Accordingly, as for [[homotopy types]] of topological spaces, in [[homological algebra]] one regards two [[chain complexes]]
$C_\bullet$, $D_\bullet$ as essentially equivalent --  "of the same weak homology type" -- if there is a [[zigzag]] of quasi-isomorphisms

$$
  C_\bullet \leftarrow \to \leftarrow \cdots \to D_\bullet
$$

between them. This is made precise by the central notion of the _[[derived category]]_ of chain complexes. We turn to this below in section _[Derived categories and derived functors](#DerivedCategoriesAndDerivedFunctors)_.


But quasi-isomorphisms are a little _coarser_ than weak homotopy equivalences. The singular chain functor $C_\bullet(-)$ forgets some of the information in the [[homotopy types]] of topological spaces. The following series of statements characterizes to some extent what exactly is lost when passing to singular homology, and which information is in fact retained.

First we need a comparison map:

+-- {: .num_defn #HurewiczHomomorphism}
###### Definition
**(Hurewicz homomorphism)**

For $(X,x)$ a [[pointed object|pointed]] [[topological space]], the **Hurewicz homomorphism** is the [[function]]

$$
  \Phi : \pi_k(X,x) \to H_k(X)
$$

from the $k$th [[homotopy group]] of $(X,x)$ to the $k$th [[singular homology]] group defined by sending

$$
  \Phi : (f : S^k \to X)_{\sim} \mapsto f_*[S_k]
$$

a representative singular $k$-sphere $f$ in $X$ to the push-forward along $f$ of the [[fundamental class]] $[S_k] \in H_k(S^k)$, example \ref{FundamentalClass}.


=--

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

For $X$ a [[topological space]] the Hurewicz homomorphism in degree 0 exhibits an [[isomorphism]] between the [[free abelian group]] $\mathbb{Z}[\pi_0(X)]$ on the set of path [[connected components]] of $X$ and the degree-0 singular homlogy:

$$
  \mathbb{Z}[\pi_0(X)]
   \simeq
  H_0(X)
  \,.
$$

=--


Since a [[homotopy group]] in positive degree depends on the [[homotopy type]] of the [[connected component]] of the base point, while the singular homology does not depend on a basepoint, it is interesting to compare these groups only for the case that $X$ is connected.

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

For $X$ a [[path-connected topological space]] the [[Hurewicz homomorphism]]
in degree 1

$$
  \Phi : \pi_1(X,x) \to H_1(X)
$$

is [[surjection|surjective]]. Its [[kernel]] is the [[commutator subgroup]]
of $\pi_1(X,x)$. Therefore it induces an [[isomorphism]] from the [[abelianization]] $\pi_1(X,x)^{ab} \coloneqq \pi_1(X,x)/[\pi_1,\pi_1]$:


$$
  \pi_1(X,x)^{ab}
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  H_1(X)
  \,.
$$

=--

For higher connected $X$ we have the

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

If $X$ is [[n-connected object in an (infinity,1)-topos|(n-1)-connected]] for $n \geq 2$ then

$$
  \Phi : \pi_n(X,x) \to H_n(X)
$$

is an [[isomorphism]].

=--

This is known as the _[[Hurewicz theorem]]_.

###### Definition

By def. \ref{RealAndComplexGrassmannian} there are canonical inclusions

$$

and

$$
  Gr_n(\mathbb{C}^k) \hookrightarrow Gr_n(\mathbb{C}^{k+1})
$$

for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$. The [[colimit]] (in [[Top]], see [there](Top#UniversalConstructions)) over these inclusions is denoted

$$
  B O(n) \coloneqq \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_k Gr_n(\mathbb{R}^k)
$$

and

$$
  B U(n) \coloneqq \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_k Gr_n(\mathbb{C}^k)

respectively.

Moreover, by def. \ref{StiefelManifold} there are canonical inclusions

$$

$$

and

$$
  V_n(\mathbb{C}^k) \hookrightarrow V_n(\mathbb{C}^{k+1})
  \,,
$$

respectively, that are compatible with the $O(n)$-[[action]] and the $U(n)$-action, respectively. The [[colimit]] (in [[Top]], see [there](Top#UniversalConstructions)) over these inclusions, regarded as equipped with the induced [[action]], is denoted

$$
  E O(n) \coloneqq \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_k V_n(\mathbb{R}^k)
$$

and

$$
  E U(n) \coloneqq \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_k V_n(\mathbb{C}^k)
  \,,
$$

respectively. The inclusions are in fact compatible with the bundle structure from prop. \ref{ProjectionFromStiefelManifoldToGrassmannianIsFiberBundle}, so that there are induced projections

respectively. These are the standard models for the **[[universal principal bundles]]** for $O$ and $U$, respectively. The corresponding [[associated bundles|associated]] [[vector bundles]]

$$
 E O(n) \underset{O(n)}{\times} \mathbb{R}^n

and

$$
 E U(n) \underset{U(n)}{\times} \mathbb{C}^n
$$

are the corresponding **[[universal vector bundles]]**.

Since the [[Cartesian product]] $O(n)\times (-)$ in [[compactly generated topological spaces]] preserves [[colimits]], it follows that the colimiting bundle is still an $O(n)$-[[principal bundle]]

and anlogously for $E U(n)$.

As such this is the standard presentation for the $O(n)$-[[universal principal bundle]]. Its base space $B O(n)$ is the corresponding _classifying space_.

Since the orthogonal groups is compact ([prop.](orthogonal+group#OrthogonalGroupIsCompact)) and by [this corollary](coset#QuotientProjectionForCompactLieSubgroupIsPrincipal) the projection $O(k)\to O(k)/O(k-n)$ is a [[Serre fibration]]. Therefore there is induced the [[long exact sequence of homotopy groups]] of this [[fiber sequence]], and by [this prop.](orthogonal+group#InclusionOfOnIntoOkIsnMinus1Equivalence) it has the following form in degrees bounded by $n$:

$$
  \cdots

This implies the claim. (Exactness of the sequence says that every element in $\pi_{\bullet \leq n-1}(V_n(\mathbb{R}^k))$ is in the kernel of zero, hence in the image of 0, hence is 0 itself.)

where the vertical and the bottom morphism are isomorphisms. Hence also the to morphisms is an isomorphism.

That $B O(n)\to \tilde B O(n+1)$ is indeed a [[Serre fibration]] follows again with [this prop.](coset#ProjectionOfCosetsIsFiberBundleForClosedSubgroupsOfCompactLieGroup), which gives the [[fiber sequence]]

## **Generalized cohomology**

We fist say what [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology theory]] is, and then we check that the
topological K-theory functor $K^\bullet$ from [above](#KTheoryRing) is an example.

There are two versions of the statement of the axioms:

* _[Reduced cohomology](#ReducedCohomology)_;

* _[Unreduced cohomology](#UnreducedCohomology)_.

There are functors taking any reduced cohomology theory to an unreduced one, and vice versa. When some fine detail in the axioms is suitably set up, then this establishes an [[equivalence of categories|equivalence]] between reduced and unreduced generalized cohomology:

The excision axiom in def. \ref{GeneralizedCohomologyTheory} is equivalent to the following statement:

For all $A,B \hookrightarrow X$ with $X = Int(A) \cup Int(B)$, then the inclusion

$$
  i \colon (A, A \cap B) \longrightarrow (X,B)
$$

induces an isomorphism,

$$

  E^\bullet(A, A \cap B)
$$

=--

(e.g [Switzer 75, 7.2](#Switzer75))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

In one direction, suppose that $E^\bullet$ satisfies the original excision axiom. Given $A,B$ with $X = \Int(A) \cup Int(B)$, set $U \coloneqq X-A$ and observe that

$$
  \begin{aligned}
     \overline{U}
        & = \overline{X-A}
     \\ & = X- Int(A)
     \\ & \subset Int(B)
  \end{aligned}
$$

and that

$$
  (X-U, B-U) = (A, A \cap B)
  \,.
$$

Hence the excision axiom implies $  E^\bullet(X, B) \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} E^\bullet(A, A \cap B)$.

Conversely, suppose $E^\bullet$ satisfies the alternative condition. Given $U \hookrightarrow A \hookrightarrow X$ with $\overline{U} \subset Int(A)$, observe that we have a cover

$$
  \begin{aligned}
          Int(X-U) \cup Int(A)
      & = (X - \overline{U}) \cap \Int(A)
   \\ & \supset (X - Int(A)) \cap Int(A)
   \\ & = X
  \end{aligned}
$$

and that

$$
  (X-U, (X-U) \cap A) = (X-U, A - U)
  \,.
$$

Hence

$$
  E^\bullet(X-U,A-U)
  \simeq
  E^\bullet(X-U, (X-U)\cap A)
  \simeq
  E^\bullet(X,A)

Let $E^\bullet$ be an cohomology theory, def. \ref{GeneralizedCohomologyTheory}, and let $A \hookrightarrow X$. Then there is an isomorphism

$$
  E^\bullet(X,A)

  E^\bullet(X \cup Cone(A), \ast)

between the value of $E^\bullet$ on the pair $(X,A)$ and its value on the [[mapping cone]] of the inclusion, relative to a basepoint.

If moreover $A \hookrightarrow X$ is (the [[retract]] of) a [[relative cell complex]] inclusion, then also the morphism in cohomology induced from the [[quotient]] map $p \;\colon\; (X,A)\longrightarrow (X/A, \ast)$ is an [[isomorphism]]:

(e.g [AGP 02, corollary 12.1.10](#AguilarGitlerPrieto02))


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Consider $U \coloneqq (Cone(A)-A \times \{0\}) \hookrightarrow Cone(A)$, the cone on $A$ minus the base $A$. We have

$$
  ( X\cup Cone(A)-U, Cone(A)-U) \simeq (X,A)
$$

and hence the first isomorphism in the statement is given by the excision axiom followed by homotopy invariance (along the contraction of the cone to the point).

Next consider the quotient of the [[mapping cone]] of the inclusion:

$$
  ( X\cup Cone(A), Cone(A) ) \longrightarrow (X/A,\ast)
  \,.
$$

If $A \hookrightarrow X$ is a cofibration, then this is a [[homotopy equivalence]] since $Cone(A)$ is contractible and since by the dual [[factorization lemma]] $X \cup Cone(A)\to X/A$ is a weak homotopy equivalence, hence a homotopy equivalence on CW-complexes.

Hence now we get a composite isomorphism

$$
  E^\bullet(X/A,\ast)
    \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  E^\bullet( X\cup Cone(A), Cone(A) )

###### Proof

We need to check the exactness axiom given any $A\hookrightarrow X$. By lemma \ref{EvaluationOfCohomologyTheoryOnGoodPairIsEvaluationOnQuotient} we have an isomorphism

  \tilde E^\bullet(X \cup Cone(A))

Unwinding the constructions shows that this makes the following [[commuting diagram|diagram commute]]:

$$
  \array{
     \tilde E^\bullet(X\cup Cone(A))

     E^\bullet(X,A)

     \tilde E^\bullet(X) &=& E^\bullet(X,\{x\})

     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     \tilde E^\bullet(A) &=& E^\bullet(A,\{a\})

###### Definition
**(reduced to unreduced cohomology)**

Let $(\tilde E^\bullet, \sigma)$ be a reduced cohomology theory, def. \ref{ReducedGeneralizedCohomology}. Define an unreduced cohomolog theory $E^\bullet$, def. \ref{GeneralizedCohomologyTheory}, by

$$
  E^\bullet(X,A)
  \coloneqq
  \tilde E^\bullet( X_+ \cup Cone(A_+))
$$

and let the connecting homomorphism be as in def. \ref{ConnectinHomomorphismForCohomologyTheoryOnInfinityCategory}.

###### Proposition

The construction in def. \ref{ReducedToUnreducedGeneralizedCohomology} indeed yields an unreduced cohomology theory.

=--

e.g. ([Switzer 75, 7.35](#Switzer75))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Exactness holds by prop. \ref{LongExactSequenceOfACohomologyTheoryOnAnInfinityCategory}. For excision, it is sufficient to consider the alternative formulation of lemma \ref{AlternativeFormulationOfExcisionAxiom}.  For CW-inclusions, this follows immediately with lemma \ref{EvaluationOfCohomologyTheoryOnGoodPairIsEvaluationOnQuotient}.

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

The constructions of def. \ref{ReducedToUnreducedGeneralizedCohomology} and def. \ref{FromUnreducedToReducedCohomology} constitute a pair of [[functors]] between then [[categories]] of reduced cohomology theories, def. \ref{ReducedGeneralizedCohomology} and unreduced cohomology theories, def. \ref{GeneralizedCohomologyTheory} which exhbit an [[equivalence of categories]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

(...careful with checking the respect for suspension iso and connecting homomorphism..)

To see that there are [[natural isomorphisms]] relating the two composites of these two functors to the identity:

One composite is

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    E^\bullet
    & \mapsto
    (\tilde E^\bullet \colon (X,x) \mapsto E^\bullet(X,\{x\}))
    \\
    & \mapsto
    ((E')^\bullet \colon (X,A) \mapsto E^\bullet( X_+ \cup Cone(A_+) ), \ast)
  \end{aligned}
  \,,
$$

where on the right we have, from the construction, the reduced mapping cone of the original inclusion $A \hookrightarrow X$ with a base point adjoined. That however is isomorphic to the unreduced mapping cone of the original inclusion. With this the natural isomorphism is given by lemma \ref{EvaluationOfCohomologyTheoryOnGoodPairIsEvaluationOnQuotient}.

The other composite is

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \tilde E^\bullet
     & \mapsto
    (E^\bullet \colon (X,A) \mapsto \tilde E^\bullet(X_+ \cup Cone(A_+)))
    \\
    & \mapsto
    ((\tilde E')^\bullet \colon X \mapsto \tilde E^\bullet(X_+ \cup Cone(*_+)))
  \end{aligned}
$$

where on the right we have the reduced mapping cone of the point inclusion with a point adoined. As before, this is isomorphic to the unreduced mapping cone of the point inclusion. That finally is clearly homotopy equivalent to $X$, and so now the natural isomorphism follows with homotopy invariance.

=--

Finally we record the following basic relation between reduced and unreduced cohomology:

+-- {: .num_prop #UnreducedCohomologyIsReducedPlusPointValue}
###### Proposition

Let $E^\bullet$ be an unreduced cohomology theory, and $\tilde E^\bullet$ its reduced cohomology theory from def. \ref{FromUnreducedToReducedCohomology}. For $(X,\ast)$ a pointed topological space, then there is an identification

$$
  E^\bullet(X) \simeq \tilde E^\bullet(X) \oplus E^\bullet(\ast)
$$

of the unreduced cohomology of $X$ with the [[direct sum]] of the reduced cohomology of $X$ and the unreduced cohomology of the base point.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The pair $\ast \hookrightarrow X$ induces the sequence

$$
  \cdots
   \to
  E^{\bullet-1}(\ast)
    \stackrel{\delta}{\longrightarrow}
  \tilde E^\bullet(X)
    \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}
  E^\bullet(X)
    \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}
  E^\bullet(\ast)
    \stackrel{\delta}{\longrightarrow}
  \tilde E^{\bullet+1}(X)
    \to
  \cdots
$$

which by the exactness clause in def. \ref{GeneralizedCohomologyTheory} is [[exact sequence|exact]].

Now since the composite $\ast \to X \to \ast$ is the identity, the morphism
$E^\bullet(X) \to E^\bullet(\ast)$ has a [[section]] and so is in particular an [[epimorphism]]. Therefore, by exactness, the [[connecting homomorphism]] vanishes, $\delta = 0$ and we have a [[short exact sequence]]

$$
  0
    \to
  \tilde E^\bullet(X)
    \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}
  E^\bullet(X)
    \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}
  E^\bullet(\ast)
    \to
  0
$$

with the right map an epimorphism. Hence this is a [[split exact sequence]] and the statement follows.

## $(\star)$ **The K-theory spectrum**
 {#TheSpectrumKU}

This section goes beyond an introduction, in that it requires more tools
from [[algebraic topology]]. We include it for completeness and as outlook.

The relevant background for this section is laid out in

* _[[Introduction to Stable homotopy theory -- P|Introduction to stable homotopy theory -- Classical homotopy theory]]_

* _[[Introduction to Stable homotopy theory -- 1-1|Introduction to stable homotopy theory -- Sequential Spectra]]_

The main point is that in terms of the [[classifying spaces]] (as [above](#ClassifyingSpaces))

$B U \times \mathbb{Z}$ and $U$ for $K^0$ and for $K^1$

the phenomenon of [[Bott periodicity]] (as [above](#BottPeriodicity)) is represented by the existence of [[weak homotopy equivalences]]

$$
  (B U) \times \mathbb{Z} \overset{\simeq_{whe}}{\longrightarrow} \Omega U
$$

and

$$
  U \overset{\simeq_{whe}}{\longrightarrow} \Omega((B U) \times \mathbb{Z})
$$

The last one is immediate, but the first one requires work, see [Aguilar-Gitler-Prieto 02](#AguilarGitlerPrieto02).

Together these show that the sequence of spaces [[KU]] with

$$
  KU_n \coloneqq
  \left\{
    \array{
      (B U) \times \mathbb{Z} & \vert n\;\text{even}
      \\
      U & \vert n \; \text{odd}
    }
  \right.
$$

and equipped with the above comparison maps forms a [[sequential spectrum]]
which is in fact an [[Omega-spectrum]].

Under the [[Brown representability theorem]], this spectrum represents topological K-theory
$K^\bullet(-)$ as a [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] theory, as [above](#GeneralizedCohomology).
