# The Legendre transformation
* table of contents

## Idea

The _Legendre transformation_ is an operation on [[convex function]]s from a real [[normed vector space]] to the [[real line]]; it is one of the cornerstones of [[convex analysis]]. The space of arguments changes accordingly.

## In classical mechanics -- Hamiltonians and Lagrangians

The main application of and the historical root of the notion of Legendre transform (in [[differential geometry]]) is in [[classical physics]] and its formalization by [[symplectic geometry]]. In [[classical mechanics]], the [[Hamiltonian]] function $H$ is a Legendre transform of the [[Lagrangean]] $L$ and vice versa. 

When one formalizes [[classical mechanics]] as the [[local prequantum field theory]] given by [[prequantized Lagrangian correspondences]], then the Legendre transform is exhibited by the lift from a [[Lagrangian correspondence]] to a [[prequantized Lagrangian correspondence]]. For more on this see at _[The classical action, the Legendre transform and Prequantized Lagrangian correspondences](prequantized+Lagrangian+correspondence#HamiltonianTrajectoriesAndPrequantizedLagrangianCorrespondences)_.
 
In many dimensions, hybrid versions are possible. When the physics of the system is given by the [[variational calculus|variational principle]], then the Legendre transform of an extremal quantity is a conserved quantity. In [[thermodynamics]], we can have some quantities set to be fixed (some candidates: entropy $S$, temperature $T$, pressure $P$, volume $V$, magnetization $M$); this dictates the choice of variables and quantity which is extremized as well as which one takes the role of conserved energy. Some of the standard choices are enthalpy $H$, Helmholtz free energy $F$, Gibbs free energy $G$, internal energy $U$, etc. 

See also [wikipedia:Legendre transformation](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/edit/Legendre+transformation) and [wikipedia:Legendre-Fenchel transformation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre-Fenchel_transformation); the two wikipedia articles have much detail in certain specific approaches and cases, but also miss some of the basic ones to be balanced.
