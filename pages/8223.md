## Introduction 

Both [[category theory]] and [[graph theory]] study patterns based on [[diagrams]] consisting of nodes and edges. Despite this surface impression, there is in fact very little interaction between the scientific communities of category theorists and of graph theorists. 

This article is a modest bridge, indicating that the _[[category]] of [[graphs]]_ (in the usual graph-theorist's sense -- see for example [Diestel](#Diestel)) has some very nice properties. 


## Simple graphs as relations 

By a **simple [[graph]]**, we mean a [[set]] $V$ equipped with a [[symmetric relation|symmetric]] [[reflexive relation|reflexive]] [[relation]] $E$. [[homomorphism|Morphisms]] between simple graphs are [[functions]] which preserve the given relations. Elements of $V$ are called _vertices_. Write $E(x, y)$ to say $(x, y) \in E$. 

When drawing graphs, we put an edge between vertices $x$, $y$ iff $x \neq y$ and $E(x, y)$. In particular, we will not bother drawing an edge between $x$ and itself; we can think of it as tacitly there if we like. Perhaps better yet, that tacit edge can be thought of as a path of length $0$ from $x$ to itself (and who bothers drawing a path of length $0$?). In any case, it is clear that there is a natural bijection between 

* simple graph structures on $V$ in the graph-theorist's sense (i.e., graphs that are undirected, loop-free, and with at most one edge between two vertices), and 

* reflexive symmetric relations on $V$; 

thus we are within our rights to identify these two concepts. 

This maneuver allows a simple definition of [[morphism]] as a [[function]] (between the sets of vertices) that preserves the edge relation:
$$ (x,y) \in E_G \;\Rightarrow\; (f(x),f(y)) \in E_H .$$

This then includes natural operations like edge contractions as quotients. Namely, if $f \colon G \to H$ is a morphism as defined above, and if we have $G(x, y)$ and $f(x) = f(y) = v$, we still have $H(f(x), f(y))$ by default, so we can think of $f$ as contracting the edge between $x$ and $y$ in $G$ down to an edge of length $0$ between $v$ and itself in $H$. 

The [[category]] of simple graphs is denoted by $SimpGph$. 


## Properties of $SimpGph$ 

The category $SimpGph$ has very good properties. For example,  

+-- {: .num_theorem} 
###### Theorem 
$SimpGph$ is a [[Grothendieck quasitopos]]. In particular, it is a [[regular category]] and even a [[logos]]. It is also $\infty$-[[extensive category|extensive]]. 
=-- 

See for example [Adamek and Herrlich](#AdamHerr). 

It is easy to describe [[monomorphism|monos]] and [[epimorphism|epis]] in $SimpGph$. For, let $Vert \colon SimpGph \to Set$ be the underlying vertex-set [[forgetful functor]]. We have two easy results:  

+-- {: .num_prop} 
###### Proposition 
$Vert$ [[reflected limit|reflects]] monos and epis (because $Vert$ is faithful). 
=-- 

+-- {: .num_prop} 
###### Proposition 
$Vert$ [[preserved limit|preserves]] [[limits]] and [[colimits]] (because it has a [[left adjoint]] $Disc$ and a [[right adjoint]] $Codisc$). 
=-- 

It follows that $Vert \colon SimpGph \to Set$ both preserves and reflects monos and epis. As a result, we can prove various simple exactness results in $SimpGph$. For instance: 

+-- {: .num_lemma}
###### Lemma 
In $SimpGph$, the [[pushout]] of any mono is a mono. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
Suppose we have a pushout diagram in $SimpGph$: 

$$\array{
G & \to & H \\
 ^\mathllap{mono} \downarrow & & \downarrow^\mathrlap{k} \\ 
G' & \to & H'
}$$ 

Since $Vert$ preserves both pushouts and monos, and since the pushout of a mono in $Set$ is a mono, we have that $Vert(k)$ is monic in $Set$. Since $Vert$ reflects monos, this means $k$ is monic in $SimpGph$. 
=-- 


### Equalizers and coequalizers

If $f, g \colon G \stackrel{\to}{\to} H$ are maps in $SimpGph$, then their [[equalizer]] $Eq(f, g) = i \colon K \to G$ is given at the vertex level by 

$$Vert(i) = Eq(Vert(f), Vert(g))$$ 

and at the edge level by $K(x, y) \Leftrightarrow G(i(x), i(y))$; in other words, if $x, y$ belong to $K$ and there is an edge between them in $G$, then that edge lies in $K$. To express this last condition, we say the subgraph $i$ is _full_ (at the edge level). 

Thus, $i$ is a regular mono in $SimpGph$ iff both $Vert(i)$ is monic in $Set$ and $i$ is full at the edge level. 

The [[coequalizer]] of $f$ and $g$, say $Coeq(f, g) = q \colon H \to Q$, is given at the vertex level by 

$$Vert(q) = Coeq(Vert(f), Vert(g))$$ 

and at the edge level by taking the image of the composite $E_H \hookrightarrow Vert(H)^2 \stackrel{q^2}{\to} Vert(Q)^2$, so that 

$$Q(x, y) \Leftrightarrow \exists_{u, v} H(u, v) \wedge q(u) = x \wedge q(v) = y.$$ 

Thus, $q$ is a [[regular epimorphism]] if it is surjective at both the vertex and edge levels. 


### Ternary factorization 

The category of simple graphs has a [[ternary factorization system]] as follows: each morphism $f \colon G \to H$ factors as 

$$G \stackrel{q}{\to} G' \stackrel{a}{\to} H' \stackrel{i}{\to} H$$ 

where 

* $q$ is a surjection between vertex-sets and at the edge level, i.e., is a [[regular epi]]; 

* $a$ induces an identity between vertex-sets (hence is [[bimorphism|jointly monic and epic]]), but without necessarily being full at the edge level; 

* $i$ is given by an injection between vertex-sets and is full at the edge level, and (thus) is a [[regular mono]]. 

The factorization of $f$ into $q$ followed by $i \circ a$ is the (regular epi)-mono factorization, while the factorization of $f$ into $a \circ q$ followed by $i$ is the epi-(regular mono) factorization. To round out
the discussion, we prove that regular monos are stable under pushout (which ensures that the epi-(regular mono) factorization is an [[orthogonal factorization system]]). 

+-- {: .num_lemma} 
###### Lemma 
In $SimpGph$, the pushout of any [[regular monomorphism]] along any map is a regular mono. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
Let $j \colon G \to H$ be a regular mono in $SimpGph$, and let $f \colon G \to G'$ be any map. Form the pushout of the pair $(j, f)$ as a coequalizer diagram 

$$G \stackrel{\overset{i_1 \circ j}{\to}}{\underset{i_2 \circ f}{\to}} H \sqcup G' \stackrel{q}{\to} H'$$ 

where $i_1 \colon H \to H \sqcup G'$, $i_2 \colon G' \to H\sqcup G'$ are the coproduct inclusions. We are trying to show that $q \circ i_2$ is a regular mono. Certainly $Vert(q i_2)$ is monic in $Set$ (again since $Vert$ preserves monos and pushouts), so we just have to check that $q i_2$ is full at the edge level. So, suppose $H'(q i_2(x), q i_2 (y))$; we must show $G'(x, y)$. According to how we form coequalizers $q$, there exist $u, v \in H \sqcup G'$ such that $q(u) = q i_2(x)$, $q(v) = q i_2(y)$, and $(H \sqcup G')(u, v)$. Since $H$ and $G'$ are embedded disjointly in their coproduct, we have that 

* either both $u$ and $v$ belong to the $G'$-component, in which case $u = i_2(x)$ and $v = i_2(y)$ (but in that case we're done because $G'(x, y)$ follows from $(H \sqcup G')(i_2 x, i_2 y)$, according to how the coproduct $H \sqcup G'$ is constructed);  

* or both $u$ and $v$ belong to the $H$-component. But according to how pushouts are constructed at the vertex level, this means there exist $g_1, g_2 \in G$ such that $f(g_1) = x$, $j(g_1) = u$ and $f(g_2) = y$, $j(g_2) = v$. Since $H(u, v)$, or $H(j(g_1), j(g_2))$, and $j$ is full at the edge level (because it is a regular mono), we have $G(g_1, g_2)$, and therefore $G'(f(g_1), f(g_2))$ or $G'(x, y)$, as desired.
