## Introduction 

Both [[category theory]] and [[graph theory]] study patterns based on [[diagrams]] consisting of nodes and edges. Despite this surface impression, there is in fact very little interaction between the scientific communities of category theorists and of graph theorists. 

This article is a modest bridge, indicating that the _[[category]] of [[graphs]]_ (in the usual graph-theorist's sense -- see for example [Diestel](#Diestel)) has some very nice properties. 


## Simple graphs as relations 

By a **simple [[graph]]**, we mean a [[set]] $V$ whose elements are called *vertices*, together with a collection of 2-element subsets $\{x, y\}$ of $V$; these are called *edges* of the graph. 

There are various ways of forming a category of simple graphs. Perhaps the most straightforward is to define a morphism of graphs $G \to H$ to be a function $f: V \to W$ between the vertex sets to be a graph morphism if $\{f(x), f(y)\}$ is an edge of $H$ whenever $\{x, y\}$ is an edge of $G$. 

Another option -- and this is the one chosen for this article -- starts by regarding a simple graph as carrying the same information as a set $V$ equipped with a [[symmetric relation|symmetric]] [[reflexive relation|reflexive]] [[relation]] $E$. Indeed, such a relation determines (and is uniquely determined by) a simple graph $G$ where for given vertices $x, y \in V$, there is an edge $\{x, y\}$ between $x$ and $y$ in $G$ iff both $(x, y) \in E$ and $x \neq y$. We will write $E(x, y)$ to mean $(x, y) \in E$. 

Then, under the relational formulation, we define a morphism $(V, E) \to (W, F)$ between simple graphs straightforwardly[^1] as a function $f: V \to W$ that preserves the relevant structure, i.e., that $E(x, y)$ implies $F(f(x), f(y))$. One reason for preferring this notion of morphism is that it allows, for example, consideration of arbitrary edge contractions of a simple graph as [[quotients]] in the category (cf. [[graph minor]]), something that is not possible under the prior notion of morphism. 

[^1]: In other words, the usual notion of morphism between structures or models as in [[model theory]]. 

Thus we will adopt the latter notion of morphism which takes reflexive symmetric relations $E$ as primary. The resulting [[category]] of simple graphs is denoted by $SimpGph$. 

Note that graphs and their morphisms can also be understood in functorial language, by regarding simple graphs as special types of [[presheaves]], as follows. Let $C$ be the category of sets $1 \coloneqq \{\ast\}$ and $2 \coloneqq \{s, t\}$ and functions between them. Then a presheaf $X: C^{op} \to Set$ is given by sets $V = X(1)$ and $E = X(2)$ and maps 

* $d_0: X(2) \stackrel{X(\ast \mapsto s)}{\to} X(1)$ (source map), 

* $d_1: X(2) \stackrel{X(\ast \mapsto t)}{\to} X(1)$ (target map), 

* $i: X(1) \stackrel{X(s, t \mapsto \ast)}{\to} X(2)$ (reflexive map), 

* $\sigma: X(2) \stackrel{X(s \mapsto t, t \mapsto s)}{\to} X(2)$ (symmetry map). 

satisfying appropriate identities imposed by equations in $C$. Simple graphs can then be regarded [[equivalence|equivalently]] as such presheaves where the map 

$$\langle d_0, d_1 \rangle: X(2) \to X(1) \times X(1)$$ 

is a [[monomorphism]]. In that case, a morphism of simple graphs amounts to a [[natural transformation]] between such presheaves. 

### An aside on other notions of graph 

"Simple graph" as defined in the nLab (see [[graph]]) means that edges are 2-element subsets of $V$, but of course that doesn't preclude consideration of other types of graph. One option is to consider sets $V$ equipped with a collection of subsets of $V$ of cardinality either 1 or 2, i.e., allowing some but not necessarily all loops as edges. We don't call those "simple graphs" (at [[graph]] they are called "loop graphs"), but nevertheless they form a respectable category under the straightforward notion of morphism $f$ (if $\{x, y\}$ is an edge of the domain, possibly with $x = y$, then $\{f(x), f(y)\}$ is an edge of the codomain). 


## Properties of $SimpGph$ 

The category $SimpGph$ has very good properties. For example,  

+-- {: .num_theorem} 
###### Theorem 
$SimpGph$ is a [[Grothendieck quasitopos]]. In particular, it is a [[regular category]] and even a [[logos]], and $SimpGph^{op}$ is also regular. It is also $\infty$-[[extensive category|extensive]]. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
(See also [Adamek and Herrlich](#AdamHerr).) As above, let $C$ be the category of sets $1$ and $2$ and functions between them, and regard the category of simple graphs as a full subcategory of the presheaf [[topos]] $Set^{C^{op}}$. For this presheaf topos, there is just one nontrivial $\neg\neg$-dense sieve, namely the inclusion 

$$(s, t): C(-, 1) + C(-, 1) \to C(-, 2)$$ 

(where $s$ is shorthand for $C(-, \ast \mapsto s)$ and similarly for $t$) and so the category of $\neg\neg$-[[separated presheaves]] is equivalent to the category of presheaves $X$ such that the induced map 

$$X(2) \cong Set^{C^{op}}(C(-, 2), X) \stackrel{(s, t)^\ast}{\to} Set^{C^{op}}(C(-, 1) + C(-, 1), X) \cong X(1) \times X(1),$$ 

which is the source-target pairing $\langle d_0, d_1 \rangle: X(2) \to X(1) \times X(1)$, is monic. In other words, a simple graph in this language is exactly a separated presheaf. On the other hand, a Grothendieck quasitopos is, essentially by definition, the category of separated presheaves for a topology on a presheaf topos, in this case the $\neg\neg$-topology. 

Being a quasitopos with small coproducts, it is $\infty$-extensive provided that coproducts are disjoint. However, this is trivial to check (it even suffices to check, according to [[Elephant]] 2.6.5, that $0 \to 1$ is a [[regular monomorphism]], or that $1 + 1$ is a disjoint coproduct, which it obviously is). 
=-- 

+-- {: .num_remark #quasitopos} 
###### Remark 
Implicit in this proof is the way in which (for example) limits of simple graphs are calculated. Since $SimpGph$ is realized as a category of separated presheaves which is a [[reflective subcategory]] of all presheaves, limits in $SimpGph$ are calculated just as they are in the presheaf category $Set^{C^{op}}$, which is to say: they are computed objectwise, at the objects $1, 2$ of $C$. 

For example, consider how to construct the [[equalizer]] of a pair of graph maps $f, g: G \rightrightarrows H$. For the vertex set of the equalizer (computing the equalizer at the object $1$ of $C$), one just takes the equalizer of the functions between the vertex sets of $G$ and $H$. At the edge set level where we have maps $E = G(2) \rightrightarrows F = H(2)$: since there is at most one edge between two vertices, the maps $f(2), g(2)$ must agree on $e \in E$ provided $f(d_0 e) = g(d_0 e$ and $f(d_1 e) = g(d_1 e)$, so the equalizer graph is just the full or [[graph|induced subgraph]] of $G$ given by the equalizer vertex set. 

Moreover, every induced subgraph $H \hookrightarrow G$ arises as an equalizer (consider the equalizer of the two embeddings of $G$ into the amalgamation $G +_H G$, which at the vertex level agrees with $H \hookrightarrow G$). 

Of course this is elementary, but we get much more more: the quasitopos $SimpGph$ is also a [[locally cartesian closed category]], and [[dependent products]] can also be read off directly from how they work for presheaves. 
=-- 

It is easy to describe [[monomorphism|monos]] and [[epimorphism|epis]] in $SimpGph$. For, let $\Gamma = \hom(1, -): SimpGph \to Set$ be the underlying vertex-set [[forgetful functor]]. 

+-- {: .num_prop #EmbeddingOfSimpGphIntoSet} 
###### Proposition 
The forgetful functor $\Gamma = \hom(1, -): SimpGph \to Set$ is faithful, in fact exhibits $SimpGph$ as a [[topological concrete category]]. 
=-- 

We omit the easy proof. Next we have two easy results:  

+-- {: .num_prop} 
###### Proposition 
$\Gamma$ [[reflected limit|reflects]] monos and epis (because $\Gamma$ is faithful). 
=-- 

+-- {: .num_prop} 
###### Proposition 
$\Gamma$ [[preserved limit|preserves]] [[limits]] and [[colimits]] (because it has a [[left adjoint]] $\Delta$ and a [[right adjoint]] $\nabla$). 
=-- 

It follows that $\Gamma: SimpGph \to Set$ both preserves and reflects monos and epis. As a result, we can prove various simple exactness results in $SimpGph$. For instance: 

+-- {: .num_lemma}
###### Lemma 
In $SimpGph$, the [[pushout]] of any mono is a mono. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
Suppose we have a pushout diagram in $SimpGph$: 

$$\array{
G & \to & H \\
 ^\mathllap{mono} \downarrow & & \downarrow^\mathrlap{k} \\ 
G' & \to & H'
}$$ 

Since $\Gamma$ preserves both pushouts and monos, and since the pushout of a mono in $Set$ is a mono, we have that $\Gamma(k)$ is monic in $Set$. Since $\Gamma$ reflects monos, this means $k$ is monic in $SimpGph$. 
=-- 

As already observed, there is a chain of adjoint functors $\Delta \dashv \Gamma \dashv \nabla: Set \to SimpGph$. But in fact there is a fourth functor in the chain: $\Delta$ has a left adjoint $\Pi: SimpGph \to Set$, the [[connected object|connected components]] functor. If $E$ is the simple graph consisting of two vertices $a, b$ with an edge between them, then there is a reflexive fork 

$$a, b: 1 \rightrightarrows E \stackrel{!}{\to} 1$$ 

and $\Pi$ is formed as a [[reflexive coequalizer]] of the induced diagram: 

$$SimpGph(1, -) \to SimpGph(E, -) \rightrightarrows SimpGph(1, -) \to \Pi$$ 

+-- {: .num_prop} 
###### Proposition 
$\Pi \dashv \Delta$, and $\Pi$ preserves products. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
$\Pi$ preserves products because being a reflexive coequalizer, it is a [[sifted colimit]] of product-preserving functors. For graphs $G$, there is a natural map $u G: G \to \Delta \Pi G$ which at the underlying vertex-set level sends a vertex to its connected component; if $S$ is any set, then a graph map $f: G \to \Delta S$ must send any two vertices with an edge between them to the same point, and so $f$ factors as $G \stackrel{u G}{\to} \Delta \Pi G \stackrel{\Delta g}{\to} \Delta S$ for a unique map $g: \Pi G \to S$, and this establishes the adjunction $\Pi \dashv \Delta$. 
=-- 

### Equalizers and coequalizers

If $f, g \colon G \stackrel{\to}{\to} H$ are maps in $SimpGph$, then their [[equalizer]] $Eq(f, g) = i \colon K \to G$ is given at the vertex level by 

$$\Gamma(i) = Eq(\Gamma(f), \Gamma(g))$$ 

and at the edge level by $K(x, y) \Leftrightarrow G(i(x), i(y))$; in other words, if $x, y$ belong to $K$ and there is an edge between them in $G$, then that edge lies in $K$. To express this last condition, we say the subgraph $i$ is _full_ (at the edge level). 

Thus, $i$ is a regular mono in $SimpGph$ iff both $\Gamma(i)$ is monic in $Set$ and $i$ is full at the edge level (see Remark \ref{quasitopos}). 

The [[coequalizer]] of $f$ and $g$, say $Coeq(f, g) = q \colon H \to Q$, is given at the vertex level by 

$$\Gamma(q) = Coeq(\Gamma(f), \Gamma(g))$$ 

and at the edge level by taking the image of the composite $E_H \hookrightarrow Vert(H)^2 \stackrel{q^2}{\to} Vert(Q)^2$, so that 

$$Q(x, y) \Leftrightarrow \exists_{u, v} H(u, v) \wedge q(u) = x \wedge q(v) = y.$$ 

Thus, $q$ is a [[regular epimorphism]] if it is surjective at both the vertex and edge levels. 


### Ternary factorization 

The category of simple graphs has a [[ternary factorization system]] as follows: each morphism $f \colon G \to H$ factors as 

$$G \stackrel{q}{\to} G' \stackrel{a}{\to} H' \stackrel{i}{\to} H$$ 

where 

* $q$ is a surjection between vertex-sets and at the edge level, i.e., is a [[regular epi]]; 

* $a$ induces an identity between vertex-sets (hence is [[bimorphism|jointly monic and epic]]), but without necessarily being full at the edge level; 

* $i$ is given by an injection between vertex-sets and is full at the edge level, and (thus) is a [[regular mono]]. 

The factorization of $f$ into $q$ followed by $i \circ a$ is the (regular epi)-mono factorization, while the factorization of $f$ into $a \circ q$ followed by $i$ is the epi-(regular mono) factorization. [The fact that regular monos are stable under pushout (which ensures that the epi-(regular mono) factorization is an [[orthogonal factorization system]]) is true because $SimpGph$, being a [[quasitopos]], is a *coregular category*, meaning $SimpGph^{op}$ is [[regular category|regular]].] Both factorizations coincide at the level of underlying functions between vertex sets, both being the usual epi-mono factorization. 

In particular, we have the easy facts that 

* $f$ is a mono iff $q$ is a graph isomorphism: monos in $SimpGph$ are simple graph maps that are injective on vertices and edges, 

* $f$ is an epi iff $i$ is a graph isomorphism: epis in $SimpGph$ are simple graph maps that are surjective on vertices. 


### Subcategories

Graph theory suggests both full and wide subcategories of $SimpGph$.

#### Full subcategories

+-- {: .query}
(here one could include a treatment of _full_ subcategories usually studied in graph theory; for example those defined by choosing a set $S$ of graphs, and then keeping only those graphs as objects which do not contain any graph in $S$ as a minor (keyword: "excluded minors"); this is a mainstay of graph theory and seems to be in tune with discussions in the nForm, and these may be full subcategories in which the flexibility of closure properties of SimpGph might be particularly useful; the choice of which full subcategory to study should be made by Todd Trimble, however, from the point of view of category-theoretic considerations)
=--
 
#### Wide subcategories

Definition \ref{threeWideSubcategories} gives three examples of wide subcategories, the definitons being graph-theoretic, the names immediately chosen to be category-theoretic, for systematic reasons.

+-- {: .num_defn #threeWideSubcategories}
###### Definition 

Let SimpGph.Monos, SimpGph.RegularMonos, and SimpGph.IsometricRegularMonos be the wide subcategories of SimpGph with the following hom-sets:

SimpGph.Monos($G_0,G_1$) $:=$  $\{$ $f$ $\in$ SimpGph$(G_0,G_1)$: the function $f$ is injective $\}$,

SimpGph.RegularMonos($G_0,G_1$) $:=$  $\{$ $f$ $\in$ SimpGph$(G_0,G_1)$: $f$ is a graph-isomorphism onto its image $\}$,

SimpGph.IsometricRegularMonos($G_0,G_1$) $:=$ $\{$ $f$ $\in$ SimpGph$(G_0,G_1)$: $f$ is a graph-isomorphism onto its image, and, for any $x,y\in V$ we have $\mathrm{dist}_{\mathrm{im}(f)}(f(x),f(y))=\mathrm{dist}_{G_1}(f(x),f(y))\}$.

(Here $\mathrm{dist}_G\colon V\times V\rightarrow\omega$ denotes the function which takes any pair of vertices the length of a shortest graph-theoretic path with those endpoints.)


 =--

Closedness under composition of each of the three subclasses of $\mathrm{Mor}(SimpGph)$ defined by Definition \ref{threeWideSubcategories} is immediate from the respective definitions. 




Evident remarks: 

* Each of SimpGph.Monos, SimpGph.RegularMonos, SimpGph.IsometricRegularMonos are [[concrete categories]]. (because of Proposition \ref{EmbeddingOfSimpGphIntoSet}) 

*  There are the class inclusions (of which the first would be false for multigraphs),

Mor(SimpGph.IsometricRegularMonos) $\subset$ Mor(SimpGph.RegularMonos) $\subset$ Mor(SimpGph.Monos) $=$ Monos(SimpGph).

* Because of the latter equality, each of SimpGph.Monos, SimpGph.RegularMonos, SimpGph.IsometricRegularMonos is a [[left cancellative category]]. (And none is a groupoid or a preorder.)


* None of 
SimpGph.Monos, SimpGph.RegularMonos, SimpGph.IsometricRegularMonos has any [[terminal object]].

* The relation $(\emptyset,\emptyset)$, which is symmetric and reflexive, is the (only) initial object of each of SimpGph.Monos, SimpGph.RegularMonos, SimpGph.IsometricRegularMonos, because this is the only initial object of SimpGph. 


We now explain the names of the three subcategories. 

* It is evident (using the functor $\Gamma$ from Proposition \ref{EmbeddingOfSimpGphIntoSet}) that the morphisms of Simp.Gph.Monos are indeed precisely the [[monos]] of SimpGph. 
 
* How to get from the _definition_ of SimpGph.RegularMonos given in Definition \ref{threeWideSubcategories} to [[regular monomorphism]]s? Answer: directly by definition of _graph-isomorphism_, Definition \ref{threeWideSubcategories} says that the morphisms $f$ of SimpGph.RegularMonos are those for which the vertex-set $\mathrm{im}(\Gamma(f))$, with $\Gamma$ from Proposition \ref{EmbeddingOfSimpGphIntoSet}, induces a graph isomorphic to the graph $\mathrm{dom}(f)$. Therefore, these morphisms are those injective graph homomorphisms whose image is an _induced_ subgraph of the target. Further, the term used in the nLab instead of _induced_ is _full_, (which, incidentally, was in use in mid-twentieth century graph theory, then fell out of favor), so the question reduces to why the morphisms $f$ of $SimpGph$ with the two properties that (1) $\Gamma(f)$ is injective and (2) the graph $im(f)$ is a full subgraph of $\mathrm{cod}(f)$, are the regular monos; but sufficient explanations for this _have already been given_ in Section "Equalizers and coequalizers" of this article.

* By definition of SimpGph.IsometricRegularMono, for each morphism of that subcategory, the graph im($f$) is what in graph theory usually is called an _isometric subgraph_. 

Isometric subgraphs have several uses in graph-theoretical considerations, which to describe here would take us too far afield.
