## Idea

The notion of _relative entropy_ of [[state]]s is a generalization of the notion of [[entropy]] to a situation where the entropy of one [[state]] is measured "relative to" another state.


## Definition

### For states on finite probability spaces
 {#OnFiniteDimensionalSpaces}

For two finite [[probability distributions]] $(p_i)$ and $(q_i)$, their **relative entropy** is 

$$
  S(p/q) := \sum_{k = 1}^n p_k(log p_k - log q_k)
  \,.
$$

Alternatively, for $\rho, \phi$ two [[density matrix|density matrices]], their relative entropy is 

$$
  S(\rho/\phi) := tr \rho(log \rho - log \phi)
  \,.
$$


### For states on general von Neumann algebras

Let $A$ be a [[von Neumann algebra]] and let $\phi$, $\psi : A \to \mathbb{C}$ be two [[state]]s on it (faithful, positive [[linear functional]]s).

###### Definition

The **relative entropy $S(\phi/\psi)$ of $\psi$ relative to $\phi$ is

$$
  S(\phi/\psi) := - (\Psi, (log \Delta_{\Phi,\Psi}) \Psi)
  \,,
$$

where $\Delta_{\Phi,\Psi}$ is the relative [[modular operator]] of any [[cyclic vector|cyclic]] and [[separating vector]] representatives $\Phi$ and $\Psi$ of $\phi$ and $\psi$.

This is due to ([Araki](#Araki)).

###### Proposition

* This definition is independent of the choice of these representatives. 

* In the case that $A$ is finite dimensional and $\rho_\phi$ and $\rho_\psi$ are [[density matrices]] of $\phi$ and $\psi$, respectively, this reduces to the [above definition](#OnFiniteDimensionalSpaces).
