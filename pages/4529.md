D-branes are boundary conditions for open strings. "D" stands for "Dirichlet".

For the relationship to (higher) category theory, see for example [this paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.2307) of Kapustin.

The relevant categories that appear in [[homological mirror symmetry]] are categories of D-branes for the appropriate string theories.

For the A-model on a symplectic manifold, the category of D-branes is described by the [[Fukaya category]].

For the B-model on a complex manifold, the category of D-branes is described by the bounded [[derived category]] of coherent sheaves.

For the A-model on a symplectic Landau-Ginzburg model, the category of D-branes is described by the [[Fukaya-Seidel category]].

For the B-model on a complex Landau-Ginzburg model, the category of D-branes is described by the category of [[matrix factorization]]s.
