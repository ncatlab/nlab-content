## Idea

A $C^*$-system is a [[C-star-algebra]] together with a group of automorphisms. In [[quantum mechanics]] as well as in [[AQFT]] the observables of the theory are [[self-adjoint operator]]s of (a net of) [[C-star-algebra]]s, in this context the [[gauge group]] of the theory is the maximal group of [[unitary operators]] that leave all observables invariant, the algebra and the gauge group form a $C^*-$system.

###### Definition
A **$C^*-$system** $(\mathcal{A}, \alpha_G)$ consists of a $C^*-$algebra $\mathcal{A}$, a locally compact group $G$ and a continuous morphism $\alpha$ of $G$ into the group $aut(\mathcal{A})$ of $*$-automorphisms of $\mathcal{A}$ equipped with the topology of pointwise convergence.

If the algebra is a $*$-[[star-algebra|algebra]] only, then some authors call it a __$*$-system__. 

Sometimes the continuity condition is dropped entirely or replaced by some weaker assumption, therefore one should always check what -- if any -- continuity assumption an author makes.

###### Definition
The **fixed point algebra** of a $C^*-$system  $(\mathcal{A}, \alpha_G)$ is $\{ A \in \mathcal{A}: a_g A = A \; \forall \; g \in G  \}$. If the fixed point algebra is trivial then $\alpha_G$ **acts ergodically**.

###### Definition
A [[state]] $\rho$ of the algebra $\mathcal{A}$ is an **invariant state** if 
$$
\rho (A) = \rho(\alpha_g A) \; \forall A \in \mathcal{A}, \; \forall g \in G.
$$
