## Quotes

### On Doubt
 {#OnDoubt}

From [Feynman 1955](#Feynman55): 

> **Of all its** $[$science's$]$ **many values, the greatest  must be the freedom to doubt**

> We have found it of paramount importance that in order to progress we must recognize the ignorance and leave room for doubt. Scientific knowledge is a body of statement of varying degree of certainty - some most unsure, some nearly sure, none *absolutely* certain.

> Now, we scientists are used to this, and we take it for granted that it is perfectly consistent to be unsure -- that it is possible to live and *not* know. But I don't know whether everyone realizes that this is true.

> Our freedom to doubt was born of a struggle against authority in the early days of science. It was a very deep and strong struggle. Permit us to question -- to doubt, that's all -- not to be sure. 

> And I think it is important that we do not forget the importance of this struggle and thus perhaps lose what we have gained. Here lies a responsibility to society.

From [Feynman 1964](#Feynman64) (from [this page](http://www.sitpor.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Helix-Books-Richard-P.-Feynman-The-Pleasure-of-Finding-Things-Out_-The-Best-Short-Works-of-Richard-Feynman-Perseus-Publishing-Company-1999.pdf#page=131) and the [next](http://www.sitpor.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Helix-Books-Richard-P.-Feynman-The-Pleasure-of-Finding-Things-Out_-The-Best-Short-Works-of-Richard-Feynman-Perseus-Publishing-Company-1999.pdf#page=132)):

> Now the next subject $[\ldots]$ I really consider the most important and the most serious. And that has to do with the question of uncertainty and doubt. 

> We absolutely must leave room for doubt or there is no progress and there is no learning. There is no learning without having to pose a question. And a question requires doubt. People search for certainty. But there is no certainty. 




From [Feynman 1988](#Feynman88):

> Have no respect _whatsoever_ for authority; forget who said it and instead look at what he starts with, where he ends up, and ask yourself, "Is it reasonable?"
