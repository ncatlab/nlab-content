## Idea

For a [[ringed topos]] $(\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{O})$ the ring object $\mathcal{O} \in \mathcal{X}$ is called the **structure sheaf**.

More generally, for $\mathcal{G}$ a [[geometry (for structured (∞,1)-toposes)]], a [[structured (∞,1)-topos]]

$$
  \mathcal{O} : \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{X}
$$

is an [[(∞,1)-topos]] equipped with a $\mathcal{G}$-valued **structure sheaf** presented by the finite-limits-preserving and cover-preserving [[(∞,1)-functor]] $\mathcal{O}$.
