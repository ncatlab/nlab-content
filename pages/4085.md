## Idea

In [[physics]] the [[theory (physics)|theory]] of _special relativity_ describes dynamics in [[physics|physical]] [[spacetime]] in absence of a field of [[gravity]].

Specifically, it models

* [[spacetime]] as a flat time-oriented [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]: 
  [[Minkowski space]];

* [[trajectories]] of point [[particles]] as timelike [[curves]] in Minkowski space.

* the [[electromagnetic field]] as a closed 2-[[differential form|form]] on Minkowski space.

* the [[Lorentz force]] exerted by the electromagnetic field on a charged particle as the contraction of that 2-form with the tangent vector of the trajectory of the particle. 

If instead of restricting to Minkowski space, spacetime is allowed to be an arbitrary [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]] one speaks of the resulting framework as the theory of _[[general relativity]]_.

Mathematically, special relativity is essentially the theory of [[Minkowski space]] as a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]], hence equipped with the constant [[metric]] [[tensor]] which at each point is the [[bilinear form]] with [[signature of a quadratic form|signature]] $(-,+, \cdots, +)$ or else $(+,-,\cdots, -)$ (depending on convention). The null-vectors in this metric characterize the speed of [[light]]. The linear [[isometries]] of this metric are the [[Lorentz transformations]] and the fact that with the Minkowski metric these also preserve, hence, null rays is the mathematical model for the famous [[phenomenology|phenomenological]] observation that "the speed of light is the same in all reference systems".
