## Idea

It is practically impossible to model a macroscopic [[physical system]] in terms of the microscopic kinematical and dynamical variables of all its [[particles]]. Thus one makes a hierarchical reduction in which this complexity is reduced to a small number of collective variables. The theoretical framework for such reductions for systems is [[statistical mechanics]] or statistical physics.

One special case of hierarchical reduction is the limit of large volumes $V$, in which the number of particles (of each species) per volume, $N/V$, stays constant. This is called the **[[thermodynamic limit]]** in statistical physics. Under some standard assumptions like homogeneity (spacial and possibly directional) and stability (no transitory effects), there is a small number of collective variables characterizing the system. Such a description can be (and historically was) postulated as an independent self-consistent phenomenological theory even without going into the details of statistical mechanics; such a description is called **[[equilibrium]] thermodynamics**, which is believed to be deducible from statistical mechanics, as has been partially proved for some classes of systems. Sometimes transitional finite-time phenomena are described either statistically by studying stochastic processes or by a more elaborate hierarchical form of thermodynamics, so-called **nonequilibrium thermodynamics**. 

One of the basic characteristics of a thermodynamical system is its [[temperature]], which has no analogue in fundamental non-statistical physics. Other common thermodynamical variables include pressure, volume, [[entropy]], enthalpy etc.

### Relativistic thermodynamics
 {#ReferencesRelativisticThermodynamics}

Making sense of thermodynamics when taking into account [[special relativity]] and ultimately, possibly, [[general relativity]] ([[gravity]]) is notoriously subtle (even ignoring the issue of [[Bekenstein-Hawking entropy]]). 

> Shortly after the advent of the relativity theory, Planck, Hassenoerl, Einstein and others advanced separately a formulation of the thermodynamical laws in accordance with the special principle of relativity. This treatment was adopted unchanged including the first edition of this monograph. However it was shown by Ott and indepently by Arzelies, that the old formulation was not quite satisfactory, in particular because generalized forces were used instead of the true mechanical forces in the description of thermodynamical processes.

> The papers of Ott and Arzelies gave rise to many controversial discussions in the literature and at the present there is no generally accepted description of relativistic thermodynamics.

A standard textbook has been

but Tolman's approach has been called into question, see e.g.
