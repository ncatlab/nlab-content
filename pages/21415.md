[[!redirects semimodel categories]]
## Idea

Introduced by Hovey in 1998,
semimodel categories are a relaxation of [[model categories]]
that allows for a largely similar theory.

The notion of a [[weak model category]] and [[premodel category]]
relaxes the definition even further.

## Definition

(See Hovey, Theorem 3.3.)

A __left semimodel category__ is a [[relative category]]
equipped with a class of [[cofibrations]] and [[fibrations]]
such that [[weak equivalences]] are closed under [[retracts]]
and the [[2-out-of-3 property]],
[[cofibrations]] have a [[left lifting property]] with respect
to [[trivial fibrations]],
[[trivial cofibrations]] with [[cofibrant]] source
have a [[left lifting property]] with respect to [[fibrations]],
and morphisms with [[cofibrant]] source
can be factored as a [[cofibration]] followed by a [[fibration]],
either one of which can be further made trivial.

A __right semimodel category__ is defined by passing to the [[opposite category]].
