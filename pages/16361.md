## Idea 

Chemistry is the branch of physical science that studies the properties of [[condensed matter]], from the scale of [[atom (physics)|atoms]] upwards.

A central part of chemistry is the identification of reaction processes -- _chemical reactions_ -- by which a variety of chemical substances (species of [[atom (physics)|atoms]] or [[molecules]]) interact to form new combinations. Such processes are typically denoted by formulas of the form

$$
  a A + b B \leftrightarrow c C + d D
$$

where the capital letters denote species of [[atom (physics)|atoms]]/[[molecules]], while the lower case letters are [[natural numbers]]. This indicates that $a$ molecules of type $A$ may react with $b$ molecules of type $B$ to $c$ molecules of type $C$ together with $d$ molecules of type $D$. 

In [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] such reactions occur in both directions, whence the double arrow. A reaction of the form

$$
  A \to c C + d D
$$

would be called a _decay_ process. Notice that analogous processes appear elsewhere, for instance there are [[nuclear reactions]] in [[particle physics]] described by the same kind of reaction diagrams. Also [[D-branes]] for the [[topological string]] undergo reaction processes of this form, see [below](#TriangulatedCategoryWithStability).

One might be tempted to recognize [[morphisms]] as in [[category theory]] in this notation, but care needs to be exercised to arrive at a sensible concept. 

## Formalization of reaction processes

It is unlikely that any formalization of reaction processes (say in [[category theory]]) will depend on the specific nature of the [[chemical elements]]. Among formalizations that do model reaction processes akin to those seen in chemistry are _stochastic Petri nets_ and _triangulated categories with stability conditions_:

### Stochastic Petri nets or Chemical reaction networks

Given a set $S$ of 'species', a **complex** of those species is a function $C : S \to \mathbb{N}$. A **reaction network** is a set of species together with a directed multigraph whose vertices are labelled by complexes of those species. Edges of the multigraph correspond to transitions.

Any reaction network gives rise to a [[Petri net]], and _vice versa_. In either case, we can label each transition by a rate constant in $(0, \infty)$. This gives **stochastic** versions of the nets and networks. (See [BaezNet](#BaezNet).)

### Triangulated categories with stability conditions
 {#TriangulatedCategoryWithStability}

One successful formalization in [[category theory]] of the idea of reaction processes appears in the context of [[D-branes]] for the [[B-model]] [[topological string]]. These are (hypothetical) physical objects that appear in different species labeled by [[objects]] in a [[triangulated category|triangulated]] [[derived category]] (of [[quasicoherent sheaves]] on some [[Calabi-Yau variety]]). There are processes

$$
  A \leftrightarrow B \oplus C
$$

by which a brane of type $A$ may decay into a brane of type B and a brane of type C.

While these are not reactions of [[chemical elements]], clearly the general form of reaction processes is similar.

And for the case of these D-branes, there happens to be a well-established and useful mathematical formalization of these reaction processes via [[category theory]]:

Namely every reaction process as above corresponds to a [[homotopy fiber sequence]] (a "distinguished triangle") in the [[triangulated category]], of the form

$$
  B \longrightarrow A \longrightarrow C
  \,.
$$

(See [Aspinwall 04](#Aspinwall04), search the document for the keyword "decay".)


Mathematically such a [[homotopy fiber sequence]] in a [[triangulated category]] precisely expresses the fact that $A$ is a "twisted [[direct sum]]" of $B$ and $C$ ([[extension]], [[semidirect product]]), hence much like the plain [[direct sum]], but with some "interaction" included.

In addition there are _[[Bridgeland stability conditions]]_ on such [[triangulated categories]] of topological D-branes. These determine which of these reaction processes lead to stable compounds, i.e. whether, in the above example, the brane of type $A$ will really decay into branes of type B and C, or if conversely the latter will fuse. (See again [Aspinwall 04](#Aspinwall04), search the document for the keyword "stability".)

After its motivation from [[D-brane]] reaction processes, the study of [[triangulated categories]] with [[Bridgeland stability conditions]] has become a rich and active area of pure [[mathematics]] in itself.
