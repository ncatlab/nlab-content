Given a (say, topological) group $G$, a __homogeneous $G$-space__ is a space with transitive $G$-action. 

Under weak topological conditions (cf. Helgason), every homogeneous space $M$ is isomorphic to a __coset space__ $G/H$ for a closed subgroup $H\subset G$ (the [[stabilizer]] of a fixed point in $X$).

A __principal homogeneous $G$-space__ is the total space of a $G$-[[torsor]] over a point. 

There are generalizations, e.g. the [[quantum homogeneous space]] for the case of quantum groups.
