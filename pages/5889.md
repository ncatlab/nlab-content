## Definition

Given a [[topological group]] or [[algebraic group]] or [[Lie group]], etc.,  $G$, a __homogeneous $G$-space__ is a [[topological space]] or [[scheme]], or [[smooth manifold]] etc. with [[transitive action|transitive]] $G$-[[action]]. 

A __principal homogeneous $G$-space__ is the total space of a $G$-[[torsor]] over a point. 


There are generalizations, e.g. the [[quantum homogeneous space]] for the case of quantum groups. 

## Examples

* A special case of homogeneous spaces are [[coset spaces]] arising from the [[quotient]] $G/H$ of a [[group]] $G$ by a subgroup. For the case of [[Lie groups]] this is also called [[Klein geometry]].

* Specifically for $G$ a [[compact Lie group]] and $T\hookrightarrow G$ a [[maximal torus]], then the coset $G/T$ play a central role in [[representation theory]] and [[cohomology]], for instance in the [[splitting principle]].

* In [[analysis]] and [[number theory]], certain functions on certain coset spaces play a role as _[[automorphic forms]]_ (e.g. [[modular forms]]). See there for more.

###### Example

The [[n-spheres]] are coset spaces of [[orthogonal groups]]

$$
  S^n \simeq O(n+1)/O(n)
  \,.
$$

For fix a unit vector in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. Then its [[orbit]] under the defining $O(n+1)$-[[action]] on $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is clearly the canonical embedding $S^n \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. But precisely the subgroup of $O(n+1)$ that consists of rotations around the axis formed by that unit vector [[stabilizer group|stabilizes]] it, and that subgroup is isomorphic to $O(n)$, hence $S^n \simeq O(n+1)/O(n)$.

## Properties

### Relation between homogenous spaces and coset spaces

Under weak topological conditions (cf. [Hegason](#Hegason)), every topological homogeneous space $M$ is isomorphic to a __[[coset]] space__ $G/H$ for a [[closed subspace|closed]] subgroup $H\subset G$ (the [[stabilizer]] of a fixed point in $X$).

### Sequences of coset spaces
 {#QuotientMapsOfCosetSpaces}

For $K \hookrightarrow H \hookrightarrow G$
two consecutive group inclusions, then there is a sequence of coset spaces of the form

$$
  H/K \longrightarrow G/K \longrightarrow G/H
$$

where the second map is the [[cofiber]] of the first. If this happens to be also a [[homotopy cofiber]] (or is turned into such, say by applying the [[singular simplicial complex]])-functor, then it induces the corresponding [[long exact sequence of homotopy groups]]

$$
  \cdots
  \to 
  \pi_{n+1}(G/H)
  \longrightarrow
  \pi_n(H/K) \longrightarrow \pi_n(G/K) \longrightarrow \pi_n(G/H)
  \longrightarrow 
  \pi_{n-1}(H/K)
  \to \cdots
$$

###### Example

Consider a sequence of inclusions of [[orthogonal groups]] of the form

$$
  O(n) \hookrightarrow O(n+1) \hookrightarrow O(n+k)
  \,.
$$

Then by example \ref{nSphereAsCosetSpace} we have that $O(n+1)/O(n) \simeq S^n$ is the [[n-sphere]] and hence there is a [[long exact sequence of homotopy groups]] of the form 

$$
  \cdots
  \to 
  \pi_q(S^n) 
  \longrightarrow \pi_q(O(n+k)/O(n)) \longrightarrow \pi_q(O(n+k)/O(n+1))
  \longrightarrow 
  \pi_{q-1}(S^n)
  \to \cdots
  \,.
$$

Now for $q \lt n$ then $\pi_q(S^n) = 0$ and hence in this range we have [[isomorphisms]]

$$
  \pi_{\bullet \lt n}(O(n+k)/O(n)) 
     \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  \pi_{\bullet \lt n}(O(n+k)/O(n+1))
 \,.
$$
