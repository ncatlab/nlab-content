## Definition

Given a [[topological group]] or [[algebraic group]] or [[Lie group]], etc.,  $G$, a __homogeneous $G$-space__ is a [[topological space]] or [[scheme]], or [[smooth manifold]] etc. with [[transitive action|transitive]] $G$-[[action]]. 

A __principal homogeneous $G$-space__ is the total space of a $G$-[[torsor]] over a point. 


There are generalizations, e.g. the [[quantum homogeneous space]] for the case of quantum groups. 

## Examples

* A special case of homogeneous spaces are [[coset spaces]] arising from the [[quotient]] $G/H$ of a [[group]] $G$ by a subgroup. For the case of [[Lie group]]s this is also called [[Klein geometry]].

* Specifically for $G$ a [[compact Lie group]] and $T\hookrightarrow G$ a [[maximal torsu]], then the coset $G/T$ play a central role in [[representation theory]] and [[cohomology]], for instance in the [[splitting principle]].

## Properties

Under weak topological conditions (cf. Sigurdur Helgason, _Differential geometry, Lie groups and symmetric spaces_), every topological homogeneous space $M$ is isomorphic to a __[[coset]] space__ $G/H$ for a [[closed subspace|closed]] subgroup $H\subset G$ (the [[stabilizer]] of a fixed point in $X$).
