  _Loop Groups, Characters and Elliptic Curves_

  talk at _[ASPECTS of Topology](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/tillmann/ASPECTS.html)_, 17-19 December 2012, Oxford, 

  ([pdf slides](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/tillmann/ASPECTSbenzvi.pdf))

on ([[geometric representation theory|geometric]]) [[representation theory]] reflected in and incarnated as low-dimensional [[extended TQFT|extended]] [[gauge field theory]], some relevant [[categorification]] in [[D-geometry]] (e. g. the [[Hecke category]]) and specifically on formalizations of [[geometric Langlands duality]] in terms of 2-dimensional [[QFT]] motivated from [[KK-compactification|compactification]] of [[N=4 D=4 super Yang-Mills theory]].
