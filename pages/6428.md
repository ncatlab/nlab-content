## Idea

Given an [[action functional]] that is invariant under a [[group]] of symmetries on the corresponding [[configuration space]], a solution to the [[Euler-Lagrange equations]] of motion is said to exhibit _spontaneously broken symmetry_ if it is not a fixed-point of that group [[action]].

In the context of the [[quantum field theory]] arising by [[quantization]] of this action functional one considers the given classical solution as a background about which to consider [[perturbation theory]]. The fields in this QFT are then small excitations of the given classical solution and the state containing no such excitations is the [[vacuum]] of the corresponding theory. Therefore in this context one often says that a quantum theory exhibits spontaneouly broken symmetry if its vacuum state is not invariant under the pertinent symmetries.

### Broken global symmetry

For $Conf$ a [[configuration space]] and

$$
  S : Conf \to \mathbb{R}
$$

an [[action functional]], consider the [[action]] of a [[group]] $G$ on $Conf$ under which $S$ is invariant: for all $g \in G$ and $\phi \in Conf$ we have $S(g(\phi)) = S(\phi)$.

Then a solution $\phi \in Conf$ to the [[Euler-Lagrange equations]] of $S$ -- a solution to the [[classical mechanics]] defines by this action functional -- is said to _**spontaneously break the symmetry group**_ if it is not a $G$-fixed point: if it is not true that for all $g \in G$ we have $g(\phi) = \phi$.

### Broken local symmetry

## Examples

### Global symmetry

#### Scalars in mexican hat potential

A standard example which is both very simple but at the same time of central importance in one of the main applications in the [[standard model of particle physics]] -- the [[Higgs effect]] -- is this:

Let $Conf = C^\infty(X = [0,1]^d, \mathbb{R}^N)$ be the configuration space of $N$ real scalar fields and take the action functional to be

$$
  S : \phi \mapsto \int_X \left( -\frac{1}{2}\vert \nabla \phi \vert^2
  -
  \frac{h}{2} \vert\phi\vert^2 - \frac{g}{4} \vert\phi\vert^4
  \right) d\mu_X
$$

for some $h, g \in \mathbb{R}$. This is manifestly invariant under the canonical action of the [[orthogonal group]] $G = O(N)$ on $Conf$.

This action functional has a class of critical points given by constant maps $\phi : X \to \mathbb{R}^n : \phi(x) = \Phi$. These extremize the [[action functional]] precisely if the $\Phi$ extremize the potential energy

$$
  \frac{m^2}{2} \vert\phi\vert^2 + \frac{g}{4} \vert\phi\vert^4
  \,.
$$

If both $g$ and $h$ are positive, then there is only one such critical point, given by $\Phi = 0$.  Therefore in this case the unique constant solution does _not_ break the symmetry, in that $g( \Phi = 0) = (\Phi = 0)$ for all $g \in O(N)$.

However, if $h$ is negative and $g$ positve, then the solutions are all those $\Phi$ with

$$
  \vert \Phi \vert^2 = - \frac{h}{g} \gt 0
  \,.
$$

The set of all these is closed under the action of $G = O(N)$ -- this group takes one of these solutions into another -- but none of these solutions is _fixed_ by this action.

One says in this case that any such solution $\phi : x \mapsto \Phi$ is a solution that _spontaneously breaks the symmetry_ of the theory.
