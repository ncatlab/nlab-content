## Idea

For $Conf$ a [[configuration space]] and

$$
  S : Conf \to \mathbb{R}
$$

an [[action functional]] that is invariant under a [[group]] $G$ of symmetries [[action|acting]] on $Conf$, in that

$$
  \forall g \in G, \phi \in Conf : \,\,\, S(g(\phi)) = S(\phi)
$$


a solution $\phi_0$ to the [[Euler-Lagrange equations]] of motion is said to exhibit **spontaneously broken symmetry** if it is not a fixed-point of that group [[action]]: if there is $g \in G$ such that $g(\phi_0) \neq \phi_0$.

The "breaking" refers to the fact that the group no longer acts. It is called "spontaneous" because one imagines that by a physical process the theory "finds" one of its solutions. This comes from the class of examples where a statistical system is first considered at high temperature and then cooled down. At some point it will "spontaneously" freeze in one allowed configuration. A standard example is a [[ferromagnet]]: at high temperature its [[magnetization]] vanishes, while at very low termperature it spontaneously finds a direction of magnetization, thus "breaking" rotational symmetry.

One calls the subgroup $G_{\phi_0} \subset G$ that fixes the given configuration $\phi_0$ the _unbroken symmetry group_ .

In the context of the [[quantum field theory]] arising by [[quantization]] of this action functional one considers the given classical solution $\phi_0$ as a background about which to consider [[perturbation theory|perturbations]] of the remaining [[effective quantum field theory]]. 

The fields in this effective QFT are then small excitations $\delta \phi$ around the given $\phi_0$. Since the original symmetry group still acts on the full fields $\phi_0 + \delta \phi$, the remaining symmetry group of the effective field theory is $G_{\phi_0}$, whose elements $g$ send

$$
  g : (\phi_0 + \delta \phi) \mapsto g(\phi_0) + g(\delta \phi)
  = \phi_0 + g \delta \phi
 \,.
$$

Since in the effective theory around $\phi_0$ the [[vacuum]] state where all the $\delta \phi$ have no excitations (or rather: are in their ground state) corresponds to $\phi_0$ itself one says in this context that _a quantum theory exhibits spontaneouly broken symmetry if its vacuum state is not invariant under the pertinent symmetries_ .


## Examples

### Scalars in mexican hat potential

A standard example which is both very simple but at the same time of central importance in one of the main applications in the [[standard model of particle physics]] -- the [[Higgs effect]] -- is this:

Let $Conf = C^\infty(X = [0,1]^d, \mathbb{R}^N)$ be the configuration space of $N$ real scalar fields and take the action functional to be

$$
  S : \phi \mapsto \int_X \left( -\frac{1}{2}\vert \nabla \phi \vert^2
  -
  \frac{h}{2} \vert\phi\vert^2 - \frac{g}{4} \vert\phi\vert^4
  \right) d\mu_X
$$

for some $h, g \in \mathbb{R}$. This is manifestly invariant under the canonical action of the [[orthogonal group]] $G = O(N)$ on $Conf$.

This action functional has a class of critical points given by constant maps $\phi : X \to \mathbb{R}^n : \phi(x) = \Phi$. These extremize the [[action functional]] precisely if the $\Phi$ extremize the potential energy

$$
  \frac{h}{2} \vert\phi\vert^2 + \frac{g}{4} \vert\phi\vert^4
  \,.
$$

If both $g$ and $h$ are positive, then there is only one such critical point, given by $\Phi = 0$.  Therefore in this case the unique constant solution does _not_ break the symmetry, in that $g( \Phi = 0) = (\Phi = 0)$ for all $g \in O(N)$.

However, if $h$ is negative and $g$ positve, then the solutions are all those $\Phi$ with

$$
  \vert \Phi \vert^2 = - \frac{h}{g} \gt 0
  \,.
$$

The set of all these is closed under the action of $G = O(N)$ -- this group takes one of these solutions into another -- but none of these solutions is _fixed_ by this action.

One says in this case that any such solution $\phi : x \mapsto \Phi$ is a solution that _spontaneously breaks the symmetry_ of the theory.


### In gravity

The theory of [[gravity]] on a given [[topological manifold]] $X$ has as 
[[configuration space|configurations]] [[pseudo-Riemannian metric]]s on $X$ and its [[action functional]] -- the [[Einstein-Hilbert action]] or one of its variants -- is invariant under the [[action]] of the [[diffeomorphism]] group on $X$.

The corresponding [[Euler-Lagrange equation]]s are _[[Einstein's equations]]_ . A given solution $(X,g)$ _breaks_ the symmetry given by a [[diffeomorphism]] $f : X \to X$ unless $f$ is an [[isometry]]. This means that the unbroken symmetries connected to the identiy correspond precisely to the [[Killing vector field]]s on $(X,g)$.

#### Kaluza-Klein reductions

Spontaneous symmetry breaking in [[gravity]] plays a central role for instance in the context of the [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism]]. For instance for $dim X = 5$ the [[effective field theory]] of gravity around a solution of the form $(X = X_4 \times S^1, g_4 \otimes g_1)$ is 4-dimensional gravity coupled to [[electromagnetism]] (and a [[dilaton]] field): the components of the field of gravity along the circle transmute into the electromagnetic field. The ansatz _breaks_ all the symmetries that would mix the remaining 4-dimensional gravitational excitations with these new electromagnetic excitations.

This is discussed in a bit of detail for instance in 
([Strominger, lecture 1](#Strominger)).

#### Super Kaluza-Klein reductions

The above discussion has a direct analog in theories of higher 
[[supergravity]]. By the same logic, one finds that the 
[[effective quantum field theory]] around classical solutions that are
[[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|Kaluza-Klein reductions]] of the form 
$(X^4 \times Y^d, (g_4 \otimes g_d))$ exhibts as global symmetries all
those [[diffeomorphism]]s that are not _spontaneously broken_ by this solution.

In this case, though, there are also [[supersymmetry]] analogs of the plain diffeomorphism action. Such a local supersymmetry remains unbroken in the given solution if it comes from a [[Killing spinor field]].

Therefore KK-reductions to 4-dimensional [[Minkowski space]] in supergravity that admit precisely four Killing spinors of the form $(\psi_4 = const \otimes \psi_d = covariantly const)$ give rise to [[effective field theories]] with exactly one remaining global [[supersymmetry]]. 

For more see [[supersymmetry and Calabi-Yau manifolds]].

This is discussed in a bit of detail for instance in 
([Strominger, lecture 2](#Strominger)).
