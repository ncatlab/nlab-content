## Idea

Lepage forms are certain [[differential forms]] on [[jet bundles]]. When of maximal horizontal degree then they may be identified with sums $\mathbf{L} + \theta$ of a [[local Lagrangian]] $\mathbf{L}$ with its induced presymplectic potential current $\theta$ (as discussed at [[covariant phase space]]).

Lepage forms play a central role in the theory of [[variational sequences]].

###### Definition

Given a [[smooth function|smooth]] [[bundle]] $E \to \Sigma$, then a [[differential n-form]] $\rho$ on its [[jet bundle]] $Jet(E)$ is called a _Lepage form_ if for every [[vector field]] $v$ on the jet bundle, the horizontal part $h(\iota_v \mathbf{d}\rho)$ (with respect to the [[variational bicomplex]]) of the contraction of $v$ into the [[de Rham differential]] of $\rho$ depends only on the projection of $v$ to a vector field on $E$ itself.

## In variational calculus

Let $\Sigma$ be of [[dimension]] $n$. Then a horizontal $n$-form $\mathbf{L} \in \Omega^{n,0}(Jet(E))$, may be regarded a [[local Lagrangian]]. Its de Rham differential has a unique decomposition

$$
  d \mathbf{L} = \mathbf{E} - d_H \theta
$$

where $E$ is a [[source form]], the [[Euler-Lagrange form]] of $\mathbf{L}$, and $\theta$, the induced presymplectic potential current, is defined up to addition of a horizontally exact form (e.g. [Zuckerman 87, section 2](#Zuckerman87)).

Then the combination

$$
  \rho \coloneqq \mathbf{L} + \theta
$$

is a Lepage form, and in fact such a form being Lepage is equivalent to $d \mathbf{L} + d_h \theta$ being a [[source form]].

The differential 

$$
  d \rho = \mathbf{E} + \omega
$$

is the sum of the [[Euler-Lagrange form]] and the presymplectic current density $\omega = d_V \theta$.

Lepage was a student of De Donder and did his work on the calculus of variations around the 1930s. Only much later, Krupka was responsible for naming Lepage forms around the 1970s.
