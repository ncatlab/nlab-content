## Idea

A Hopf algebroid is a possibly noncommutative generalization of a structure which is dual to a groupoid in the sense of space-algebra duality. In other words, function algebras on the space of objects and space of morphisms of a groupoid pack together in a structure of Hopf algebroid. 

## Commutative Hopf algebroids

Given an internal [[groupoid]] in the category $Aff_k$ of affine algebraic $k$-[[schemes]], where $k$ is a field, the $k$-algebras of [[global section]]s over the scheme of objects and scheme of morphisms have an additional structure of a commutative Hopf algebroid. In fact this is an [[dual equivalence|antiequivalence of categories]]. Commutative Hopf algebroids are useful also in a version in [[brave new algebra]] (the work of Rognes). 

## Noncommutative Hopf algebroids 

There are several generalization to the noncommutative case. A difficult part is to work over the noncommutative base (i.e., the object of objects is noncommutative). The definition of a [[bialgebroid]] is not that difficult and there is even a very old definition due Takeuchi. To add an antipode is nontrivial. A definition of Lu from mid 1990s is rather nonselfdual unlike the case of [[Hopf algebras]]. So a better solution is to abandon the idea of an antipode and have some replacement for it. There are two approaches, one via [[monoidal bicategory|monoidal bicategories]] due to Day and Street, and another due Gabi Böhm, using pairs of a left and right bialgebroid. Gabi has later shown that the two definitions are in fact equivalent.

## Literature

The commutative version is classical, and there is an extensive literature. 

A nonsymmetric version is due Lu and a similar version is later studied by Xu
