## Idea

A Hopf algebroid is an associative [[bialgebroid]] with an antipode. 

A _Hopf algebroid_ is a (possibly [[noncommutative geometry|noncommutative]]) generalization of a structure which is dual to a [[groupoid]] (equipped with [[atlas]]) in the sense of [[Isbell duality|space-algebra duality]]. This is the concept that generalizes [[Hopf algebras]] with their relation to [[groups]] from groups to groupoids.

More details on the case of the Hopf algebroids 
associated to groupoids, i.e. the convolution Hopf algebroid and groupoid Hopf algebroid see the entry [[Hopf algebroid over a commutative base]].  


## Definition (under construction)

In the general case we should distinguish left and right bialgebroids, see [[bialgebroid]]. 

In one of the versions, a general Hopf algebroid 
is defined as a pair of a left algebroid and right algebroid together with a linear map from left to right bialgebroid taking the role of an antipode
(...).

### Commutative Hopf algebroids

Given an internal [[groupoid]] in the category $Aff_k$ of affine algebraic $k$-[[schemes]], where $k$ is a field, the $k$-algebras of [[global sections]] over the scheme of objects and the scheme of morphisms have an additional structure of a commutative Hopf algebroid. In fact this is an [[dual equivalence|antiequivalence of categories]]. Commutative Hopf algebroids are useful also in a version in [[brave new algebra]] (the work of John Rognes). 

### Noncommutative Hopf algebroids 

There are several generalizations to the noncommutative case. A difficult part is to work over the noncommutative base (i.e., the object of objects is noncommutative). The definition of a [[bialgebroid]] is not that difficult and there is even a very old definition due Takeuchi. To add an antipode is nontrivial. A definition of Lu from mid 1990s is rather nonselfdual unlike the case of [[Hopf algebras]]. So a better solution is to abandon the idea of an antipode and have some replacement for it. There are two approaches, one via [[monoidal bicategory|monoidal bicategories]] due to Day and Street, and another due [[Gabi Böhm]], using pairs of a left and right bialgebroid. Gabi has later shown that the two definitions are in fact equivalent.

## Properties

### Steenrod operations on coTor groups

For $\Gamma$ a suitable Hopf algebroid and $N_1, N_2$
two [[comodules]], then the co[[Tor]] groups $CoTor_\Gamma(N_1, N_2)$
form a _[[Steenrod algebra]]_. See there for details and citations.

## Examples

### Scalar extension Hopf algebroids

Given a Hopf algebra $B$ and a braided-commutative algebra $A$ in the category of Yetter-Drinfeld modules over $B$, the smash product algebra $B\sharp A$ is the total algebra of a Hopf algebroid over $A$. 

## References

The commutative version is classical, and there is an extensive literature, see [[Hopf algebroids over a commutative base]]. 

One can straightforwardly keep the base commutative while having the total algebra noncommutative, and the image of source and target maps are required to commute mutually. This version is due Maltsiniotis; he also generalized this to [[quasi-Hopf algebra|quasi-Hopf]] version:
