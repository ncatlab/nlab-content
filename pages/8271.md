[arXiv:0911.0343](http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/0911.0343) Perverse coherent t-structures through torsion theories
from arXiv Front: math.CT by Jorge Vitoria
Bezrukavnikov (later together with Arinkin) recovered the work of Deligne
defining perverse $t$-structures for the derived category of coherent sheaves
on a projective variety. In this text we prove that these $t$-structures can be
obtained through tilting torsion theories as in the work of Happel, Reiten and
Smal\o. This approach proves to be slightly more general as it allows us to
define, in the quasi-coherent setting, similar perverse $t$-structures for
certain noncommutative projective planes.

[arXiv:1009.5904](http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/1009.5904) Weight structures and simple dg modules for positive dg algebras
from arXiv Front: math.KT by Bernhard Keller, Pedro Nicolas
Using techniques due to Dwyer-Greenlees-Iyengar we construct weight
structures in triangulated categories generated by compact objects. We apply
our result to show that, for a dg category whose homology vanishes in negative
degrees and is semi-simple in degree 0, each simple module over the homology
lifts to a dg module which is unique up to isomorphism in the derived category.
This allows us, in certain situations, to deduce the existence of a canonical
t-structure on the perfect derived category of a dg algebra. From this, we can
obtain a bijection between hearts of t-structures and sets of so-called
simple-minded objects for some dg algebras (including

[arXiv:1206.4882](http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/1206.4882) Glueing silting objects
from arXiv Front: math.CT by Qunhua Liu, Jorge Vitoria, Dong Yang
Recent results by Keller and Nicol{á}s and by Koenig and Yang have shown
bijective correspondences between suitable classes of t-structures and
co-t-structures with certain objects of the derived category: silting objects.
On the other hand, the techniques of glueing (co-)t-structures along a
recollement play an important role in the understanding of derived module
categories. Using the above correspondence with silting objects we present
explicit constructions of glueing of silting objects, and, furthermore, we
answer the question of when is the glued silting tilting.
