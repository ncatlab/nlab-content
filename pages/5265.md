## Definition

In [[homological algebra]]:

For $F : \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{B}$ a [[left exact functor|left exact]] [[additive functor]] between [[abelian categories]], an [[object]] $A \in \mathcal{A}$ is $F$-**acyclic** if the right [[derived functor]] of $F$ has no cohomology on $A$ in positive degree

$$
  (p \gt 0) \Rightarrow R^p F A = 0
  \,.
$$

## Properties

A [[resolution]] by $F$-acyclic objects serves to compute the [[derived functor]] of $F$. See at _[derived functor in homological algebra -- Via acyclic resolutions](derived+functor+in+homological+algebra#ViaAcyclicResolutions)_
