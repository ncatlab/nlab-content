## Idea

The [[Bousfield localization of spectra|localization]] of [[complex cobordism cohomology theory]] $MU$ at a [[prime]] $p$, hence the [[p-localization]] $MU_{(p)}$, decomposes as a [[direct sum]]. The direct summands are the _Brown-Peterson spectra_.

## Definition

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

For each [[prime]] $p$ there is an unique commutative ring [[spectrum]] $B P$ which is a [[retract]] of $M U_{(p)}$ such that the map $MU_{(p)} \to B P$ is multiplicative and such that

Due to ([Brown-Peterson 66](#BrownPeterson66)), recalled as ([Ravenel, theorem, 4.1.12](#Ravenel)).

## Properties

### Universal characterization

(...)

The [[formal group law]] of Brown-Peterson cohomology theory is [[universal property|universal]] for $p$-local [[complex oriented cohomology theories]] in that $\mathbb{G}_{B P}$ is universal among $p$-local, [[p-typical formal group laws]].

(...)

### Relation to $p$-typical formal groups

$B P$ is related to [[p-typical formal groups]] as [[MU]] is to [[formal groups]].

### Hopf algebroid structure on dual BP-Steenrod algebra

The structure of [[Hopf algebroid over a commutative base]]
on the dual $BP$-[[Steenrod algebra]]
$BP_\bullet(BP)$ is described by the [[Adams-Quillen theorem]].

### Relation to Adams-Novikov spectral sequence

The $p$-component of the $E^2$-term of the [[Adams-Novikov spectral sequence]] for the [[sphere spectrum]], hence the one converging to the 
[[stable homotopy groups of spheres]] $\pi_\ast(\mathbb{S})$ is

$$
  Ext_{BP_\ast(BP)}(BP_\ast, BP_\ast)
  \,.
$$
