## Idea

The [[Bousfield localization of spectra|localization]] $MU_{(p)}$ of [[complex cobordism cohomology theory]] $MU$ at a [[prime]] $p$ decomposes as a [[direct sum]]. The direct summands are the _Brown-Peterson spectra_.

## Definition

###### Theorem

For each [[prime]] $p$ there is an unique [[E-∞ ring]] [[spectrum]] $B P$ which is a [[retract]] of $M U_{(p)}$ such that the map $MU_{(p)} \to B P$ is multiplicative and such that
