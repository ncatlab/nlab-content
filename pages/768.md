The notion of classifying space should be regarded in general terms as giving a functor 

$$  B :(algebraic data) \to (topological data).$$

Composition with a forgetful functor $U: (topological data) \to (topological spaces) $ gives a [[classifying space]]. 

Some such constructions arise from generalisations of the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]], with values in [[simplicial set]]s. For example, from a [[crossed complex]] $C$ one obtains a simplicial  set $Nerve(C)$ which in dimension $n$ is $Crs(\Pi(\Delta^n_*),C)$. The geometric realisation $BC$ of this is canonically filtered by the skeleta of $C$, so $B$ is really a functor to [[filtered space]]s. This ties in with the functor $\Pi$ which goes in the opposite direction. But note that there is a different filtration of the space $BC$ since it is a CW-complex, and so $\Pi$ of this filtration gives a free crossed complex. 

Special cases of crossed complexes are [[groupoid]]s, and so we get the classifying space of a groupoid; and similarly of a [[crossed module]]. 

A crossed module is equivalent to a category object in groups, and so a nerve of this can be constructed as a bisimplicial set. The geometric realisation of this is naturally bifiltered, in several ways!

In considering what is desirable for a [[fundamental infinity-groupoid]] one should bring the notion of classifying space, and its inherited structure, into account.
