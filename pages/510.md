
Many very different things in mathematics are called _spectrum_ or _spectral_ or the like. This entry is about the notion of spectrum in [[stable homotopy theory]]. Most other meanings are instances of [[spectral theory]] including

* [[spectrum of an operator]], spectra of families, of a Banach algebra, [[Gelfand spectrum]], prime (primitive etc.) spectrum of a commutative or noncommutative ring, [[spectrum of an abelian category]], [[Orlov spectrum]] of a triangulated category etc.

There is also a notion of 

* [[spectral sequence]]

which have no particular relation to other notions of _spectrum_ .

## Idea 

A [[topological space|topological]] spectrum is an object in the universal [[stable (∞,1)-category]] $Sp(Top) \simeq Sp(\infty Grpd)$ that "stabilizes" the [[(∞,1)-category]] [[Top]] or $\simeq$ [[∞-Grpd]] of [[topological spaces]] or [[∞-groupoids]]: the [[stable (∞,1)-category of spectra]].

Recall that the central characterization of a [[stable (∞,1)-category]] is that all objects $A$ have a [[delooping]] object $\mathbf{B}A$ that is written $\Sigma A$ in this context and called the _suspension_ of $A$. Thus a spectrum is like a [[topological space]] or [[∞-groupoid]] that may be [[delooping|delooped]] indefinitely.

### Connective spectra

In fact all ordinary [[topological spaces]] and [[∞-groupoids]] that have the property that all their [[deloopings]] exist give rise to special examples of spectra.  These are called the

* **[[connective spectrum|connective spectra]]**

* or **infinite [[loop spaces]]** 

* or [[group object in an (infinity,1)-category|grouplike]] [[symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category|symmetric monoidal]] [[∞-groupoid]]s.

Connective spectra form a [[sub-(∞,1)-category]] of spectra

$$
  Top \stackrel{\supset}{\leftarrow} ConnectSp(Top) \hookrightarrow Sp(Top)
  \,.
$$

There are objects in $Sp(Top)$, though, that do not come from "naively" delooping a space infinitely many times.  These are the **non-connective spectra**.  For general spectra there is a notion of [[homotopy groups]] of negative degree. The connective ones are precisely those for which all negative degree [[homotopy groups]] vanish.

Connective spectra are well familiar in as far as they are in the image of the [[nerve]] operation of the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]]: this identifies [[∞-groupoids]] that are not only connective spectra but even have a _strict_ symmetric monoidal [[group]] structure with non-negatively graded [[chain complex]]es of abelian groups. 

$$
 \array{
  Ch_+ &\stackrel{Dold-Kan \; nerve}{\to}&
  ConnectSp(\infty Grp) \subset \infty Grpd
  \\
  (\cdots A_2 \stackrel{\partial}{\to} A_1 \stackrel{\partial}{\to} A_0 \to 0 \to 0 \to \cdots)
  &\stackrel{}{\mapsto}&
  N(A_\bullet)
 }
$$

The [[homology]] groups of the chain complex correspond precisely to the [[homotopy groups]] of the corresponding [[topological space]] or [[∞-groupoid]].

The free stabilization of the [[(∞,1)-category]] of non-negatively graded chain complexes is simpy the [[stable (∞,1)-category]] of arbitrary chain complexes. There is a stabilized Dold-Kan correspondence that identifies these with special objects in $Sp(Top)$. 

$$
 \array{
  Ch &\stackrel{Dold-Kan \; nerve}{\to}&
   Sp(\infty Grp) 
  \\
  (\cdots A_2 \stackrel{\partial}{\to} A_1 \stackrel{\partial}{\to} A_0 \stackrel{\partial}{\to} A_{-1} 
  \stackrel{\partial}{\to} A_{-2} \to \cdots)
  &\stackrel{}{\mapsto}&
  N(A_\bullet)
 }
$$

So it is the homologically nontrivial parts of the chain complexes in negative degree that corresponds to the non-connectiveness of a spectrum.

## Definition 

There are many "models" for spectra, all of which present the same homotopy theory (and in fact, nearly all of them are [[Quillen equivalence|Quillen equivalent]] [[model category|model categories]]).  

### Spectra, CW-spectra

A simple first definition is to define a spectrum $\mathbf{E}$ to be a sequence of pointed spaces $(E_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ together with structure maps $\Sigma{}E_n\to{}E_{n+1}$ (where $\Sigma$ denotes the [[reduced suspension]]).

There are various conditions that can be put on the spaces $E_n$ and the structure maps, for example if the spaces are CW-complexes and the structure maps are inclusions of subcomplexes, the spectrum is called a **CW-spectrum**.

Without any condition, this is just called a **spectrum**, or sometimes a **pre-spectrum**.

### $\Omega$-spectra
 {#OmegaSpectrum}

If $\Omega$ denotes the [[loop space]] functor on the category of pointed spaces, we know that $\Sigma$ is left adjoint to $\Omega$.
In particular, given a spectrum $\mathbf{E}$, the structure maps can be transformed into maps $E_n\to\Omega{}E_{n+1}$.
If these maps are isomorphisms (depending on the situation it can be weak equivalences or homeomorphisms), then $\mathbf{E}$ is called an **$\Omega$-spectrum**.

The idea is that $E_0$ contains the information of $\mathbf{E}$ in dimensions $k\ge 0$, $E_1$ contains the information of $\mathbf{E}$ in $k\ge -1$ (but shifted up by one, so that it is modeled by the $\ge 0$ information in the space $E_1$), and so on.

$\Omega$-spectra are special cases of spectra, and are in fact the fibrant objects for some model structure on the category of spectra.
Given any spectrum $\mathbf{E}$, it is easy to transform it into an equivalent $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathbf{F}$ (a fibrant replacement of $\mathbf{E}$) : just take $F_n=\lim_{m\to\infty}\Omega^m E_{n+m}$ and use the fact that $\Omega$ commutes with the filtered colimits.

### Coordinate-free spectrum 

A definition of spectrum consisting of spaces indexed by index sets less "coordinatized" than the integers is a 

* [[coordinate-free spectrum]].

See there for details.

### Combinatorial definition

There might be a type of categorical structure related to a spectrum in the same way that $\infty$-categories are related to $\infty$-groupoids.  In other words, it would contain $k$-cells for all integers $k$, not necessarily invertible.  Some people have called this conjectural object a **$Z$-category**.   "Connective" $Z$-categories could perhaps then be identified with stably monoidal $\infty$-categories.

One realization of this kind of idea is the notion of [[combinatorial spectrum]].



## Examples 

* [[suspension spectrum]]

* [[sphere spectrum]]

* [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum]]

* [[K-theory spectrum]]

* [[tmf]]

* [[Thom spectrum]], [[complex cobordism spectrum]]


## Properties

### Stabilization

In direct analogy to how topological spaces form the archetypical example, [[Top]], of an [[(∞,1)-category]], spectra form the archetypical example $Sp(Top)$ of a [[stable (∞,1)-category]]. In fact, there is a general procedure for turning any [[pointed category|pointed]] [[(∞,1)-category]] $C$ into a stable $(\infty,1)$-category $Sp(C)$, and doing this to the category $Top_*$ of [[pointed object|pointed]] spaces yields $Sp(Top)$.
