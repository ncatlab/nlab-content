## Definition

A **constant stack** is a [[stack]] that is equivalent to the [[stackification]] of a presheaf that is constant (as a [[functor]]).




## Pattern

* A [[locally constant function]] is a section of a [[constant sheaf]];

* a [[locally constant sheaf]] is a section of a **constant stack**;

* a [[locally constant stack]] is a section of (... and so on...)

* a [[locally constant ∞-stack]] is a section of a [[constant ∞-stack]].

A locally constant sheaf / $\infty$-stack is also called a [[local system]].
