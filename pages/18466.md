## Idea

What is called _causal perturbation theory_ is a mathematically rigorous construction of [[perturbative quantum field theory|perturbative]] [[gauge theory|gauge]] [[quantum field theory]] such as [[quantum electrodynamics]] based on the formulation of renormalization by Stückelberg-Bogoliubov-Epstein-Glaser (see [here](renormalization#SBEG)).
