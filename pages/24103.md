## Definition ##

A **real polynomial function** is a [[polynomial function]] in the [[real numbers]]. Equivalently, it is a function $f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ with a [[natural number]] $n \in \mathbb{R}$ and a [[list]] of real numbers $a_i$ for $i \leq n$, such that $f$ is a [[solution]] to the $(n + 1)$-th order linear homogeneous [[ordinary differential equation]] 
$$\frac{d^{n + 1} f}{d x^{n + 1}} = 0$$ 
with initial conditions 
$$\frac{d^i f}{d x^i}(0) = (i!) a_i$$
for each natural number $i \leq n$

## Properties ##

### Continuity ###

Given a [[real polynomial function]] $P \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, if here $\mathbb{R}$ is regarded as a [[Euclidean space]] (equipped with its [[metric topology]]), then this is a [[pointwise continuous function]].
