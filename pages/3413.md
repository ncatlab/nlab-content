

**John Michael Boardman** (1938-2021) was a British-born mathematician, specialised in [[algebraic topology]] and [[differential topology]]. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Cambridge in 1964. His thesis advisor was [[C. T. C. Wall]]. He was formerly at the University of Cambridge, England; later a full professor at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, USA.

## Selected writings


Boardman introduced the [[stable homotopy theory|stable homotopy category]] in 1969. His notes on this subject were never formally published, but [[Rainer Vogt]] gave a course on this subject in Aarhus in 1969:  

* [course notes](http://openlibrary.org/b/OL5743316M/Boardman%27s_stable_homotopy_category)


He coauthored with [[Vogt]] the famous book 

* **Homotopy invariant algebraic structures on topological spaces**, Springer Lecture Notes in Math 347 (1973).

This book introduced the notion of [[weak Kan complex]] that was later popularized by [[André Joyal]] under the name [[quasi-category]] as a natural basis for the  [[higher category theory]] of [[(∞,1)-category|(∞,1)-categories]].

On stable [[cohomology operations]], but mostly reviewing the background of [[stable homotopy theory]], [[Whitehead-generalized cohomology theory]], [[ring spectra]], [[multiplicative cohomology theory]], [[complex oriented cohomology]] and the examples of [[KU]], [[MU]], [[BP]]:

On unstable [[cohomology operations]] (hence: in [[non-abelian cohomology]]):

Stephen Wilson]], _Unstable Operations in Generalized Cohomology_ ([pdf](https://hopf.math.purdue.edu/Boardman-Johnson-Wilson/bjw.pdf)), in: [[Ioan Mackenzie James]] (ed.) _[[Handbook of Algebraic Topology]]_ Oxford 1995 ([doi:10.1016/B978-0-444-81779-2.X5000-7](https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-444-81779-2.X5000-7))
