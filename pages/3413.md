His thesis advisor was C. T. C. Wall. He was formerly at the University of Cambridge, England; he is currently a full professor at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, USA.

Boardman introduced the [[stable homotopy theory|stable homotopy category]] in 1969. His notes on this subject were never formally published, but [[Rainer Vogt]] gave a course on this subject in Aarhus in 1969:

He coauthored with [[Vogt]] the famous book 

* **Homotopy invariant algebraic structures on topological spaces**, Springer Lecture Notes in Math 347 (1973).

This book introduced the notion of [[weak Kan complex]] that was later popularized by [[André Joyal]] under the name [[quasi-category]] as a natural basis for the  [[higher category theory]] of [[(∞,1)-category|(∞,1)-categories]].
