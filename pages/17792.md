## Definition

A _finite product_ is a [[product]] ([[Cartesian product]]) of a [[finite number]] of factors.

Finite products are generated from the empty product (the [[terminal object]]) and binary products.

Similarly a _finite coproduct_ is a [[coproduct]] of a [[finite number]] of summands. This is generated from the empty coproduct, the [[initial object]], and binary coproducts.
