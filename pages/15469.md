Tom Price: Well on one day they say that on another day they say, oh the individual mandate isn't that important if the Court strikes it down then we'll work through it on a rule or a regulatory standpoint. The fact of the matter is, the American people don't want Washington in charge of health care. And that's what this bill does. So we believe the whole thing has to come down. We have to repeal the entire law and move forward with those positive solutions to get folks covered, to address the costs in health care which weren't addressed in this legislation, to make certain that we have the highest quality care in the world, which we are losing as we speak, and to make sure that patient choices are respected. There are wonderful ways to do that without putting Washington in charge of our health care.
