Added value: Here's a worthwhile discovery that you can apply pretty much throughout the grocery store: Most products labeled "quick" or "instant" are barely any faster than the real thing, invariably have been packed with weird, bad-tasting, science-y ingredients, and always cost more money. This kind of stuff is invented because there aren't many ways for food companies to increase their profit on the sale of, say, an apple. They have to add value to that apple. So they slice half an apple, sprinkle it with a preservative, and seal it in a single-serving bag: Voila! A ready-packed snack to sell for easily twice the price of a humble piece of fruit, and with a shelflife of months and the opportunity to emblazon a colorful brand logo on a piece of plastic packaging. All of which is to say, creepy. For me, real food, please.
