Given an [[object]] $X$ in some [[category]], a family $(f_i\colon U_i \to X)_i$ of [[morphisms]] to $X$ is an __epic [[sink]]__, or a __jointly epic family__ if, given any two morphisms $g, h\colon X \to Y$ such that $f_i ; g = f_i ; h$ for all $i$, it follows that $g = h$.

Dually, a family $(f_i\colon X \to U_i)_i$ of morphisms from $X$ is a __monic source__, or a __jointly monic family__ if, given any two morphisms $g, h\colon Y \to X$ such that $f_i \circ g = f_i \circ h$ for all $i$, it follows that $g = h$.

A single morphism $U \to X$ or $X \to U$ is an [[epimorphism]] if and only it forms an epic sink by itself, and a [[monomorphism]] iff it forms a monic source by itself.
