## Idea ##

A pure type system is an explicitly typed [[lambda calculus]]
using [[dependent product]] as the type of lambda expressions:
the basic idea is that
$$\Gamma, x:A \vdash B:C$$
implies
$$\Gamma \vdash (\lambda x:A . B) : (\prod x:A . C).$$

In other words a _pure type system_ is

1. a system of [[natural deduction]];

1. for [[dependent types]];

1. and with (only) the [[dependent product type]] [[type formation|formation]] rule specified.


## Definition ##

A _pure type system_ is defined by
* a set $S$ of _sorts_, all of which are constants,
* a set $A$ of _axioms_ of the form $c : s$ with $c$ a constant and $s$ a sort,
* a set $R \hookrightarrow S \times S \times S$ of _[[relations]]_: triples $(s_{1}, s_{2}, s_{3}) $ of sorts.
  Relations $(s_{1}, s_{2}, s_{2})$ are abbreviated as $(s_{1}, s_{2})$.

###### Remark

These relations will appear in the [[type formation]] rule for [[dependent product types]] below. They will say that for a type of sort $s_2$ [[dependent type|depending]] on a type of sort $s_2$ its dependent product is a type of sort $s_3$.

###### Remark

In fact _all_ such triples appearing in the following have $s_2 = s_3$. So we can just as well regard genuine relations $R \hookrightarrow S\times S$.

From the above input data we derive the following 

1. The **terms** of a pure type system are the following (recursive definition):
   * variables and constants
   * $(\lambda x : A . B)$ (abstraction)
   * $(\prod x : A . B)$ (product)
   * $A B$ (application)

   Here $x$ is a variable and $A$, $B$ are terms. The operators $\lambda$ and $\prod$ bind the variable $x$.

1. The **typing of terms** is inductively defined by the following rules.

   A typing is of the form 

   $$
     x_{1} : A_{1}, \dots, x_{n} : A_{n} \vdash A : B
   $$ 
 
   meaning that the types of the variables declared on the left induces the term $A$ has type $B$. Note that types are also terms.

   The order of variable  declarations is significant:
the declaration $x_{i} : A_{i}$ may depend on declarations to its left.

The [[natural deduction]] rules are defined to be the following, for all $s \in S$ and where $x$ ranges over the set of variables.

## Examples ##

### Strongly normalizing systems ###

#### Intuitionistic (higher-order) logic ####

#### Lambda cube #### 

The lambda cube consists of eight systems arranged in a cube.
The most expressive is given by the following choice of sorts, axioms and relations:

| symbol | actual value
|--------|-------------
| $S = $ | $\{\ast, \square\}$
| $A =$  | $\{(\ast : \square)\}$
| $R =$  | $\{(\ast, \ast), (\ast, \square), (\square, \ast), (\square, \square)\}$ 

(Here $\{\ast, \Box\}$ denotes the 2-element set.)

The other systems omit some of the last three relations.
Some specific systems:

name                                                  | $(\ast, \ast)$ | $(\ast, \square)$ | $(\square, \ast)$ | $(\square, \square)$ | 
------------------------------------------------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
$\lambda\rightarrow$ [[simply typed lambda calculus]] | yes            |                   |                   |                      |
[[LF]]                               | yes            | yes               |                   |                      |
$\lambda2$ [[system F]]                                                | yes            |                   | yes               |                      |
[[calculus of constructions]]                          | yes            | yes               | yes               | yes                  |

### Inconsistent systems ### 

The most permissive pure type system:

| symbol | actual value
|--------|-------------
| $S = $ | $\{\ast\}$
| $A = $ | $\{(\ast : \ast)\}$
| $R = $ | $\{(\ast, \ast)\}$

But there is an example with even non-circular system of axioms:

| symbol | actual value
|--------|-------------
| $S =$  | $\{ \ast, \square, \triangle\}$
| $A =$  | $\{(\ast : \square), (\square : \triangle)\}$
| $R = $ | $\{(\ast, \ast), (\square, \ast), (\square, \square), (\triangle, \square)\}$

## Related concepts

The _[[calculus of inductive constructions]]_ can be formulated as a particular pure type system (with a hierarchy of [[type of types]]) augmented by rules for introduing [[inductive types]].
