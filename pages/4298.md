## Definition

Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a [[von Neumann algebra]] acting on a [[Hilbert space]] $\mathcal{H}$.

A vector $x \in \mathcal{H}$ is a **cyclic vector** if $\mathcal{M}x$ is [[dense subspace|dense]] in $\mathcal{H}$.


## Properties

The notions of cyclic vector is dual to that of [[separating vector]] with respect to the [[commutant]] $\mathcal{M}'$, that is a vector is cyclic for $\mathcal{M}$ iff it is separating for $\mathcal{M}'$.
