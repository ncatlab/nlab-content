## Idea

### Statement

In [Awodey 09](#Awodey09), [Awodey 10](#Awodey10) was first expressed 
the idea that [[dependent type theory]] with intensional [[identity types]] ([[Martin-Löf dependent type theory]]), viewed as [[homotopy type theory]], is in similar relation to the concept of [[(∞,1)-toposes]] as [[extensional type theory]] is to the ordinary concept of [[toposes]] (as discussed at [[relation between type theory and category theory]]).

From [Awodey 09, p. 13](#Awodey09), [Awodey 10, p. 15](#Awodey10):

> The homotopy interpretation of Martin-Löf type theory into Quillen model categories, and the related results on type-theoretic constructions of higher groupoids, are analogous to basic results interpreting extensional type theory and higher-order logic in (1-)toposes, and clearly indicate that the logic of higher toposes, and therewith of higher homotopy theory, is a form of intensional type theory.

A concise statement would be that the [[internal logic of an (∞,1)-topos|internal logic of (∞,1)-toposes]] is [[homotopy type theory]], though there is fine print involved.

Following this suggestion, the weaker form of this idea, ignoring the [[univalence|univalent]] [[type universe]] and relating to the broader class of [[locally Cartesian closed (∞,1)-categories]], was stated more concretely as a conjecture in [Joyal 11](#Joyal11). Fore more precision see [Kapulkin-Lumsdaine 16, p. 9](#KapulkinLumsdaine16).

Roughly, this is about the following table of correspondences (for more see at [[relation between type theory and category theory]]):

| [[internal logic]]/[[type theory]] | [[higher category theory|higher]] [[category theory]] |
|-----|--------|
| [[type theory]] | [[locally Cartesian closed categories]] |
| [[homotopy type theory]] | [[locally Cartesian closed (∞,1)-categories]] |
| [[homotopy type theory]] with [[univalence|univalent]] [[type universes]] | [[elementary (∞,1)-toposes]] |

Fore more precision see [Kapulkin-Lumsdaine 16, p. 9](#KapulkinLumsdaine16).

### Proof

A [[proof]] of the weaker version of the conjecture, in form of the statement that every [[locally presentable (∞,1)-category|locally presentable]] [[locally Cartesian closed (∞,1)-category]] is presented by a suitable [[type theoretic model category]] which provides [[categorical semantics]] for [[homotopy type theory]], was proven in [Shulman 12, Example 2.16](#Shulman12), following [Cisinski 12](#Cisinski12).

Generalizing this to a proof of the full conjecture required finding "strict" models for the [object classifier](object+classifier#DetailsObjClassf) by strict [[type universes]]. A series of article ([Shulman 12](#Shulman12), [Shulman 13](#Shulman13)) showed that this is possible in an increasing class of special cases. 

A proof of the general case was finally announced in [Shulman 19](#Shulman19).

The proof of the weaker version of Awodey's conjecture (that every [[locally Cartesian closed (∞,1)-category]] has a presentation by a suitable [[type-theoretic model category]] which provides [[categorical semantics]] for [[homotopy type theory]]) is due, independently, to Example 2.16 of
