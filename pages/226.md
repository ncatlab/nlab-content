## Defintiion

A for $k$ a [[field]], a _vector space_ is [[module]] (in [[Ab]]) over the [[ring]] $k$.

The [[category]] of vector spaces is typically denoted [[Vect]], or 
$Vect_k$ if we wish to make the field $k$ explicit. So

$$
  Vect_k := k Mod
  \,.
$$

This category has vector spaces over $k$ as objects, and $k$-linear maps between these as morphisms.


## Discussion

_[[Eric Forgy]] says_: Is there a nice _arrow theoretic_ way to define vector spaces?

_[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]] says_: There is comparatively nice abstract nonsense to be said about _rings_. For instance, a [[ring]] is a category with one object [[enriched category|enriched in]] the category of abelian groups. From that starting point the concepts of ring theory develop rather naturally from pure category theoretic reasoning. In particular [[module|modules]] over rings appear naturally.

For some reason this is different when rings are refined to _fields_ and modules to vector spaces. The very concept of a _field_ is somehow not as natural from a category theoretic perspective, or at least I don't see how it is. This problem becomes very manifest when one tries to categorify fields and vector spaces: it is very straightforward to categorify rings and their modules, but their refinement to categorified fields  and vector spaces is harder.

>The remainder of this discussion has been moved to [[field]].

_[[Eric Forgy|Eric]] says_: Could you somehow define a vector space as a "degroupoidified" groupoid? That would be pretty.
