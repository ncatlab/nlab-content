## Definition

A for $k$ a [[field]], a __vector space__ over $k$ is [[module]] over the [[ring]] $k$.  Sometimes a vector space over $k$ is called a __$k$-linear space__.  (Compare ‘$k$-[[linear map]]’.)

The [[category]] of vector spaces is typically denoted [[Vect]], or 
$Vect_k$ if we wish to make the field $k$ explicit. So

$$
  Vect_k \coloneqq k Mod
  \,.
$$

This category has vector spaces over $k$ as objects, and $k$-linear maps between these as morphisms.


## Properties

By the _[[basis theorem]]_ (and using the [[axiom of choice]]) every vector space admits a [[basis of a vector space|basis]].
