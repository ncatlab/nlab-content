## Idea

A **rational homotopy equivalence** is the notion of equivalence of [[topological space]]s as used in [[rational homotopy theory]]. Where a [[weak homotopy equivalence]] in ordinary [[homotopy theory]] identifies spaces under morphisms that induce isomorphisms on all [[homotopy group]]s, rational homotopy equivalences identify spaces under morphisms that induce isomorphisms on all _rationalized_ homotopy groups.

## Definition

For $X$ and $Y$ [[topological space]]s and $f : X \to Y$ a continuous map between them, $f$ is called a **rational homotopy equivalence** if the following equivalent conditions are satisfied:

1. it induces an isomorphism on rationalized homotopy groups: $\pi_*(f) : \pi_*(X) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} \pi_*(X)$;

1. it induces an isomorphism on rational [[homology]] groups: $H_*(f,\mathbb{Q}) : H_*(X,\mathbb{Q}) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} H_*(X,\mathbb{Q})$;

1. it induces an isomorphism on rational [[cohomology]] groups: $H^*(f,\mathbb{Q}) : H^*(X,\mathbb{Q}) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} H^*(X,\mathbb{Q})$;

1. it induces a [[weak homotopy equivalence]] on the  [[rationalization]]s $X_{ra}$ and $Y_{ra}$ : $f_{ra} : X_{ra} \stackrel{\simeq_{whe}{\to} Y_{ra}$.
