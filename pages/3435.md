* [[Pierre Gabriel|P. Gabriel]], M. Zisman, _Calculus of Fractions and Homotopy Theory_, Springer 1967. Ergebnisse der Mathematik und ihrer Grenzgebiete, Band 35.

This book first introduced a general localization of a category by  an arbitrary class of morphisms (nowdays called the Gabriel-Zisman localization); however the size issues are not discussed and the formalism of universes is understood as an excuse. The special case of [[calculus of fractions|categories of fractions]] is treated in detail. 

The book has large historical importance for a clean and inovative formalism treating the interaction of category theory (including [[adjoint functors]], [[Kan extensions]], [[strict 2-category|strict 2-categories]]), simplicial methods and homotopy theory. An important version of a definition of a homotopy category by the abstract categorical localization by the class of weak equivalences is introduced. It has been proved that the homotopy category of CW complexes and of simplicial sets are equivalent. The method of the notion of a fundamental category of a simplicial set (now sometimes also called the homotopy category), refining in a sense the notion of fundamental groupoid, is defined using adjointness. An important method for studying cofibrations of simplicial sets, namely the notion of an [[anodyne extension]] is introduced for the first time and effectively used. 

The book is written in a recognizable abstract, clean and precise language with economic, rather short and formal, formulations.
