This entry is about the book

* [[Pierre Gabriel]], [[Michel Zisman]], 

  _Calculus of Fractions and Homotopy Theory_, 

  Ergebnisse der Mathematik und ihrer Grenzgebiete, Band 35, Springer (1967) 
 
  ([pdf](https://www.math.rochester.edu/people/faculty/doug/otherpapers/GZ.pdf))

on _[[homotopy theory]]_ and specifically the [[calculus of fractions]] for constructing [[homotopy categories]].

This book first introduced a general [[localization]] of a [[category]] at  an arbitrary [[class]] of [[morphisms]] (nowadays sometimes called the _Gabriel-Zisman localization_ (see also _[[Gabriel localization]]_)); however the [[size issues]] are not discussed and the formalism of [[Grothendieck universe|universes]] is understood as an excuse. The special case of [[calculus of fractions|categories of fractions]] is treated in detail. 

The book has large historical importance for a clean and innovative formalism treating the interaction of [[category theory]] (including [[adjoint functors]], [[Kan extensions]], [[strict 2-category|strict 2-categories]]), [[simplicial set|simplicial]] methods and [[homotopy theory]]. An important version of a definition of a [[homotopy category]] by the abstract categorical localization by the class of [[weak equivalences]] is introduced. 

It has been proved that the [[homotopy categories]] of [[CW complexes]] and of [[simplicial sets]] are equivalent. The method of the notion of a _fundamental category_ of a simplicial set (now sometimes also called the [[homotopy category]]), refining in a sense the notion of [[fundamental groupoid]], is defined using [[adjoint functor|adjointness]]. 

An important method for studying [[cofibrations]] of [[simplicial sets]], namely the notion of an [[anodyne extension]], is introduced for the first time and effectively used. 

The book is written in a recognizable abstract, clean and precise language with economic, rather short and formal, formulations.
