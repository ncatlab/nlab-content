## Idea

Arithmetic geometry is a branch of [[algebraic geometry]] studying [[schemes]] (usually of [[morphism of finite type|finite type]]) over the [[spectrum (geometry)|spectrum]] $Spec(\mathbb{Z})$ of the [[commutative ring]] of [[integers]]. More generally often [[algebraic geometry]] over non-[[algebraically closed fields]] is also referred to as "arithmetic algebraic geometry".

For [[number theory|number theoretic]] purposes, i.e. in actual [[arithmetic]]; usually one complements this with some data "at the prime at infinity" leading to a more modern notion of an _[[arithmetic scheme]]_ (cf. [[Arakelov geometry]]). 

The refinement to [[higher geometry]] is [[E-infinity geometry]] ([[spectral geometry]]).
