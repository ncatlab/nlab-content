## Idea

Arithmetic geometry is a branch of [[algebraic geometry]] studying [[schemes]] (usually of [[morphism of finite type|finite type]]) over the [[spectrum (geometry)|spectrum]] [[Spec(Z)]] of the [[commutative ring]] of [[integers]]. More generally often [[algebraic geometry]] over non-[[algebraically closed fields]] or fields of [[positive characteristic]] is also referred to as "arithmetic algebraic geometry".

An archetypical application of arithmetic geometry is the study of [[elliptic curves]] over the [[integers]] and the [[rational numbers]].

For [[number theory|number theoretic]] purposes, i.e. in actual [[arithmetic]]; usually one complements this with some data "at the prime at infinity" leading to a more modern notion of an _[[arithmetic scheme]]_ (cf. [[Arakelov geometry]]). 

The refinement to [[higher geometry]] is [[E-infinity geometry]] ([[spectral geometry]]).

## Properties

### Base over $\mathbb{F}_1$

Arithmetic geometry naturally has as [[base topos]] the topos over [[F1]] in the sense of [[Borger's absolute geometry]], which gives an [[essential geometric morphism]] of [[etale toposes]]

$$
  Et(Spec(\mathbb{Z}))  \longrightarrow Et(Spec(\mathbb{F}_1))
  \,.
$$
