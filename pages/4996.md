## Idea

An _$(\infty,1)$-cohesive site_ is a [[site]] such that the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves]] over it is a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]].




## Definition

+-- {: .un_def}
###### Definition

A [[site]] $C$ is **$\infty$-cohesive** over [[∞Grpd]] if it is

* a [[strongly ∞-connected site]]

* and an [[∞-local site]].


In detail this means that $C$ is

* a [[site]] -- a [[small category]] $C$ equipped with a [[coverage]];

* with the property that

  * it has a [[terminal object]] $*$;

  * it is a [[cosifted category]] (for instance in that it has all finite [[product]]s);
  
  * for every [[covering]] family $\{U_i \to U\}$ in $C$ 

    * the [[Cech nerve]] $C(U) \in [C^{op}, sSet]$ is degreewise 
      a [[coproduct]] of [[representable functor|representables]];

    * the [[simplicial set]] obtained by replacing each copy of a representable by a point is [[contractible]] (weakly equivalent to the 
      point in the standard [[model structure on simplicial sets]])

      $$
        \lim_\to C(U) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} *
      $$

    * the simplicial set of points in $C(U)$ is weakly equivalent to the set of points of $U$:

      $$
        Hom_C(*, C(U)) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} Hom_C(*,U)
        \,.
      $$
  
=--

+-- {: .un_remark}
###### Remark

These conditions are stronger than for a [[cohesive site]], which only guarantees cohesiveness of the 1-topos over it.

This definition is supposed to model the following ideas:

* every object $U$ has an underlying set of points $Hom_C(*,U)$. We may think of each $U$  as specifying one way in which there can be cohesion on this underlying set of points;

* in view of the [[nerve theorem]] the condition that $\lim_\to C(U)$ is contractible means that $U$ itself is contractible, as seen by the [[Grothendieck topology]] on $C$. This reflects the _local_ aspect of cohesion: we only specify cohesive structure on contractible lumps of points;

* in view of this the remaining condition that $Hom_C(*,C(U))$ is contractible is the $\infty$-analog of the condition on a [[concrete site]] that $Hom_C(*,\coprod_i U_i) \to Hom_C(*, U)$ is surjective.  This expresses that the notion of topology on $C$ and its concreteness over [[Set]] are consistent.

## Examples

+-- {: .un_example}
###### Example

The site for a [[presheaf topos]], hence with trivial topology, is $\infty$-cohesive if it has finite [[product]]s.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

All covers $\{U_i \to U\}$ consist of only the [[identity]] morphism $\{U \stackrel{Id}{\to} U\}$. The Cech $C\{U\}$ is then the [[simplicial object]] constant on $U$ and hence satisfies its two conditions above trivially.

=--

+-- {: .un_example}
###### Examples/Proposition

The following [[site]]s are $\infty$-cohesive:

* the category [[CartSp]] with covering families given by open covers $\{U_i \hookrightarrow U\}$ by [[geodesically convex|convex]] subsets $U_i$;

  we can take the morphisms $\mathbb{R}^k \to \mathbb{R}^l$ in $CartSp$ to be 

  * [[continuous maps]] 

    -- in which case the sheaf topos over it models generalized [[topological space]]s, the [[2-sheaf]] [[2-topos]] contains for instance [[topological stack]]s; 

  * or [[smooth maps]]

    -- in which case the sheaf topos models generalized [[smooth space]]s such as [[diffeological space]]s, the [[(∞,1)-sheaf (∞,1)-topos]] is that of [[∞-Lie groupoid]]s;


* the site [[ThCartSp]] $ \subset \mathbb{L}$ of [[smooth loci]] consisting smoth loci of the form $R^n \times D^l_{(k)}$ with the second factor infinitesimal, where covering families those of the form $\{U_i \times D^l_{(k)} \to U \times D^l_{(k)}\}$ with $\{U_i \to U\}$ a covering family in $CartSp$ as above. 

  This is a site of definition for the [[Cahiers topos]].

More discussion of these two examples is at [[∞-Lie groupoid]] and [[∞-Lie algebroid]].

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof



Since every [[star-shaped]] region in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is [[diffeomorphic]] to an [[open ball]] (see there for details) we have that the covers $\{U_i \to U\}$ on [[CartSp]] by convex subsets are [[good open covers]] in the strong sens that all finite non-empty interseciton is [[diffeomorphic]] to an [[open ball]] and hence diffeomorphic to a [[Cartesian space]]. Therefore these are [[good open cover]]s in the strong sense of the word and their [[Cech nerve]]s $C(U)$ are degreewise coproducts of representables.

The fact that $\lim_\to C(U) \simeq *$ follows from the [[nerve theorem]], using that a [[Cartesian space]] regarded as a [[topological space]] is [[contractible]].

+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Theorem

Let $C$ be an $\infty$-cohesive site. Then the [[(∞,1)-sheaf (∞,1)-topos]] $Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C)$ over $C$ is a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]]. 

If for all objects $U$ of $C$ we have that $C(*,U)$ is not empty, then _pieces have points_ in the cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos.

=--

Since the [[(n,1)-topos]] over a site for any $n \in \mathbb{N}$ arises as the full [[sub-(∞,1)-category]] of the $(\infty,1)$-topos on the $n$-[[truncated]] objects and since the definition of cohesive $(n,1)$-topos is compatible with such truncation, it follows that

+-- {: .un_corollary}
###### Corollary

Let $C$ be an $\infty$-cohesive site. Then for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the [[(n,1)-topos]] $Sh_{(n,1)}(C)$ is cohesive. 

=--

To prove this, we need to show that

1. $Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C)$ is a [[locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos]] and a [[∞-connected (∞,1)-topos]].

  This follows with the discussion at [[∞-connected site]].

1. $Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C)$ is a [[loal (∞,1)-topos]]. 

   This follows with the discussion at [[∞-local site]].

1. The [[fundamental ∞-groupoid (∞,1)-functor in a locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos]] $\Pi : Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C) \to \infty Grpd$ preserves finite [[(∞,1)-products]]. 

1. If $\Gamma(U)$ is not empty for all $U \in C$, then _pieces have points_ in $Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C)$.

The last two conditions we demonstrate now.

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

The functor $Pi : Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C) \to \infty Grpd$ whose existence is guaranteed by the above proposition preserves [[product]]s:

$$
  \Pi(A \times B) \simeq \Pi(A) \times \Pi(B)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the discussion at [[∞-connected siite]] we have that $\Pi$ is given by the [[(∞,1)-colimit]] $\lim_\to : PSh_{(\infty,1)}(C) \to \infty Grpd$. By the assumption that $C$ is a [[cosifted (∞,1)-category]], it follows that this operation preserves finite products.

=--




+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

If the $\infty$-cohesive site $C$ has the property that for all $U \in C$ $\Gamma(U)$ is not empty, then:

for $S \in \infty Grpd$ the natural morphisms

$$
  Disc S \to Codisc S
$$

are  

* [[monomorphism in an (∞,1)-category]].

* $(\infty,1)$-[[regular monomorphism]]s.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The first statement is obvious. For the second we have to show that for $S$ a [[Kan complex]] and $U \in C$ with underlying set $\Gamma(U)$ the morphism

$$
  S \to S^{\Gamma(U)}
$$

is the [[homotopy limit]] over some cosimplicial diagram. Take that diagram to be

$$
  sSet({C(\Gamma(U) \to *)},S)
  =
  \left(
    sSet(\Gamma(U),S)
    \stackrel{\to}{\to}
    sSet(\Gamma(U) \times \Gamma(U), S)
    \stackrel{\to}{\stackrel{\to}{\to}}
    sSet(\Gamma(U) \times \Gamma(U) \times \Gamma(U), S)
    \cdots
  \right)
  \,.
$$

We claim that this is fibrant in the [[Reedy model structure]] on [[cosimplicial object]]s in $sSet_{Quillen}$: in degree $k$ the map into the matching  object is

$$
  sSet(\Gamma(U)^k, S) \to 
  \lim_{\leftarrow_i} sSet(\Gamma(U)^i, S)
  =
  sSet(\lim_{\to_i} \Gamma(U)^i, S)
  \,.
$$ 

Since $S$ is fibrant in $sSet_{Quillen}$ and using that
$sSet_{Quillen}$ is a [[simplicial model category]], we have that this
is a fibration if

$$
  \lim_{\to_i} \Gamma(U)^i \to \Gamma(U)^k
$$

is a coffibration. But this is the inclusion 
into all $k$-tuples of elements of $U$ of those $k$-tuples for which 
an entry repeats. So this is a monomorphism, hence a cofibration.

Therefore the [[homotopy limit]] over $sSet({C(\Gamma(U) \to *)},S)$
is the ordinary limit, which is

$$
  \lim_{\leftarrow_k} sSet(\Gamma(U)^k, S)
  =
  sSet(\lim_{\to_k} \Gamma(U)^k, S)
  = sSet(*, S)
  = S
  \,.
$$
