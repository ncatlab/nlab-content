## Idea ##

The _Cauchy principal value_ of a [[function]] which is [[integrable function|integrable]] on the [[complement]] of one point is, if it exists, the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] of the [[integrals]] of the function over subsets in the [[complement]] of this point as these integration [[domains]] tend to that point _symmetrically_ from all sides.

One also subsumes the case that the "point" is "at infinity", hence that the function is [[integrable function|integrable]] over every [[bounded subsets|bounded]] [[domain]]. In this case the Cauchy principal value is the [[limit of a sequence|limit]], if it exists, of the [[integrals]] of the function over bounded domains, as their bounds tend _symmetrically_ to infinity.

The operation of sending a [[compactly supported function|compactly supported]] [[smooth function]] ([[bump function]]) to Cauchy principal value of its pointwise product with a function $f$ that may be singular at the origin defines a [[distribution]], usually denoted $p.v.(f)$.  

When the Cauchy principal value exists but the full [[integral]] does not (hence when the full integral "diverges") one may think of the Cauchy principal value as "exracting a finite value from a diverging quantity". This is similar to the _intuition_ of the early days of [[renormalization]] in [[perturbative quantum field theory]] ([[Schwinger-Tomonaga-Feynman-Dyson]]), but one has to be careful not to carry this analogy too far.

One point where the Cauchy principal value really does play a key role in [[perturbative quantum field theory]] is in the computation of [[Green functions]] ([[propagators]]) for the [[Klein-Gordon operator]] and the [[Dirac operator]]. See at _[[advanced and retarded propagator]]_ for more on this.

###### Definition

Let $f \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a [[function]] on the [[real line]] such that for every [[positive real number]] $\epsilon$ its [[restrictioo]] to $\matbbb{R}\setminus (-\epsilon, \epsilon)$ is [[integrable function|integrable]]. Then the _Cauchy principal value_ of $f$ is, if it exists, the [[limit of a sequence|limit]]

$$
  p.v.(f) = \underset{\epsilon \to 0}{\lim} 
  \underset{\mathbb{R} \setminus (-\epsilon, \epsilon)}{\int} f(x) \, d x
  \,.
$$
