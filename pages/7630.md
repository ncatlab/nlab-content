## Idea

A **promonoidal category** is like a [[monoidal category]] in whose structure (namely, tensor product and unit object) we have replaced [[functors]] by [[profunctors]].  It is a categorification of the idea of a [[boolean algebra]].

## Definition

A **promonoidal category** is a [[pseudomonoid]] in the [[monoidal bicategory]] [[Prof]].  This means that it is a [[category]] $A$ together with

* A profunctor $P \colon A\times A$ ⇸ $A$.
* A profunctor $J\colon 1$ ⇸ $A$.
* Associativity and unit isomorphisms $P \odot (P\times 1) \cong P\odot (1\times P)$, $P\odot (J\times 1) \cong 1$, and $P\odot (1\times J) \cong 1$.
* The usual pentagon and unit conditions hold, as in a [[monoidal category]].

Recalling that a profunctor $A$ ⇸ $B$ is defined to be a functor $B^{op}\times A \to Set$, we can make this more explicit.  We can also generalize it by replacing $Set$ by a [[Benabou cosmos]] $V$ and $A$ by a $V$-[[enriched category]]; then a profunctor is a $V$-functor $B^{op}\times A \to V$.

Thus, we obtain the following as an explicit definition of **promonoidal $V$-category**: we have the following data

1. A $V$-category $A$.

1. A $3$-ary functor $P:A^\op \otimes A \otimes A\to V$.  For notational clarity, we may write $P(a,b,c)$ as $P(a,b \diamond c)$.

1. A $V$-functor $J:A^{op}\to V$.

and natural isomorphisms

1. $\lambda_{ab}:\int^x (J(x) \otimes P(b,a \diamond x))\to A(b,a)$

1. $\rho_{ab}: \int^x ( J(x)\otimes P(b,x \diamond a))\to A(b,a)$

1. $\alpha_{abcd}: \int^x (P(x,a\diamond b)\otimes P(d,x\diamond c)) \to \int^x(P(x,b\diamond c)\otimes P(d,a\diamond x))$

satisfying the pentagon and unit axioms.

## Properties

### Versus monoidal categories

Since any functor induces a representable profunctor, any monoidal category can be regarded as a promonoidal category.  A given promonoidal category arises in this way if and only if the profunctors $P$ and $J$ are representable.

### Day convolution

A promonoidal structure on $A$ suffices to induce a monoidal structure on $V^{A^{op}}$ by [[Day convolution]].  In fact, given a small $V$-category $A$, there is an equivalence of categories between

1. the category of pro-monoidal structures on $A$, with strong pro-monoidal functors between them, and 

1. the category of biclosed monoidal structures on $V^{A^{op}}$, with strong monoidal functors between them.

### Versus multicategories

A promonoidal structure on $A$ can be identified with a particular sort of [[multicategory]] structure on $A^{op}$, i.e. with a co-multicategory structure on $A$.  The set $P(x, y, z)$ is regarded as the set of co-multimorphisms $x \to (y,z)$.

More generally, we define a co-multicategory $\bar A$ as follows.  The objects of $\bar A$ are the objects of $A$.  The co-multimorphisms $b\to a_1\dots a_n$ in $\bar A$ are defined by induction on $n$ as follows: $\bar A(b;)=Jb$, and $\bar A(b;a_1,\dots,a_{n+1})=\int^x\bar A(x;a_1,\dots,a_n)\otimes P(b,x\diamond a_{n+1})$.

Not every co-multicategory arises from a promonoidal one in this way.  Roughly, a promonoidal category is a co-multicategory whose $n$-ary co-multimorphisms are determined by the binary, unary, and nullary morphisms.  In general, co-multicategories can be identified with a certain sort of "lax promonidal category".

## Notes

[[Brian Day]] introduced the notion of a "premonoidal" category in [(Day 1970)](#Day70), and later renamed this to a "promonoidal" category in [(Day 1974)](#Day74) while reformulating the identity and associativity isomorphisms $\lambda,\rho,\alpha$ explicitly in terms of profunctor composition.  However, note that his definition is op'd from the definition used in this article, in the sense that a Day-promonoidal structure on a category $C$ corresponds to a pseudomonoid structure on $C^{op}$ in [[Prof]].  In particular, one example Day considers is that of a [[closed category]], which is actually a co-promonoidal category in the sense used here (analogous to the co-promonoidal structure on a multicategory described above).

Regarding monoidal categories as promonoidal is useful in order to express extra structure on them, such as [[closed monoidal category|closedness]], [[star-autonomous category|$\ast$-autonomy]], or [[compact closed category|compact closedness]], in abstract bicategorical terms: these notions can be defined by adding extra structure to a [[pseudomonoid]] in the [[monoidal bicategory]] [[Prof]] (i.e. a promonoidal category), but the extra structure does not lie inside the sub-monoidal bicategory [[Cat]].
