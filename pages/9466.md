
__Augustin-Louis Cauchy__ was a pioneer in [[analysis]] and [[group theory]].  He wrote an influential 1821 textbook, _[[Cours d'Analyse]]_.

Cauchy described the basic concepts of [[differential calculus|differential]] and [[integral calculus|integral]] [[infinitesimal calculus|calculus]] in terms of [[convergence|limits]].  His conception of limits was based on [[infinitesimal]] [[variables]], which do not appear as such in modern [[mathematics]], although they have been variously identified with [[sequences]] (that converge to zero), [[ultrafilters]] (that converge to zero), [[hyperpoint|hyperpoints]] (in the [[infinitesimal neighborhood|infinitesimal neighbourhood]] of zero) in the sense of [[nonstandard analysis]], etc.  (His infinitesimals were *not* [[nilpotent infinitesimal|nilpotent]].)

Cauchy\'s student [[Karl Weierstrass]] defined limits in terms of [[Richard Dedekind]]\'s static conceptions of [[real number]] and [[function]], creating modern [[analysis]].

Cauchy is associated with:

*  the [[Cauchy group theorem]]
*  [[Cauchy sequences]] (and thus [[Cauchy nets]], [[Cauchy filters]], and [[Cauchy spaces]], although Cauchy himself knew none of these)
*  the [[Cauchy-Riemann equation|Cauchyâ€“Riemann equations]]

*  the [[Cauchy integral theorem]] and [[Cauchy integral formula]]
*  the [[Cauchy integral]]

*  [[Cours d'Analyse]], a textbook on [[infinitesimal analysis]]/[[epsilontic analysis]]

*  [[Cauchy sum theorem]] ("[[Cauchy's mistake]]") from his 1821 textbook [[Cours d'Analyse]]
