## Idea

In [[physics]], the term _general covariance_ is meant to indicate the property of a [[physical system]] or [[model (in theoretical physics)]] whose [[configuration space|configurations]], [[action functional]] and [[equations of motion]] are all [[equivariance|equivariant]] under the [[action]] of the [[diffeomorphism group]] on the [[smooth manifold]] underlying the [[spacetime]] or the [[worldvolume]] of the system. Here "covariance" is as in "[[covariant tensor]]" another term for behaviour under diffeomorphisms.

The term _[[general relativity]]_ for [[Einstein]]-[[gravity]] originates in at least related ideas (see _[History and original formulation](HistoryAndOriginalFormulation)_ below), and Einstein-gravity is the archtypical example of a generally covariant physical system: 

here, the [[configuration space]] of fields over a [[smooth manifold]] $X$ is not quite the space of [[Riemannian metrics]] on $X$ itself, but is the [[quotient]] of this space by the [[action]] of the [[diffeomorphism group]] $Diff(X)$: two Riemannian metrics $g_1$ and $g_2$ on $X$ represent the same field of [[gravity]] on $X$ if there is a [[diffeomorphism]] $f : X \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} X$ such that $g_2 = f^* g_1$.

Or rather, such a diffeomorphism is a [[gauge transformation]] between the two field configurations. The configuration space is not the naive [[quotient]] of fields by diffeomorphisms, but is the [[homotopy quotient]], or _[[action groupoid]]_. In the physics literature this action groupoid is most familiar in its [[infinitesimal cohesion|infinitesimal approximation]], the corresponding [[Lie algebroid]], whose formal dual is a [[BRST complex]] whose degree-1 elements are accordingly called the _diffeomorphism ghosts_ (see there).

As with all [[gauge transformations]], they relate physical configurations which may be nominally different, but [[equivalence|equivalent]],.
Thereofore _general covariance_ is an instance of the general _[[principle of equivalence]]_ in mathematics which says that sensible statements about [[objects]] must respect the [[isomorphisms]] and more general [[equivalences]] between these objects. 

A physical system which is not generally covariant in this sense is hence one where the [[smooth manifold]] $X$ as abover, underlying [[spacetime]]/[[worldvolume]] is not regarded as modelling an absolute physical system (such as the [[observable universe]] in gravity), but a [[subsystem]] that is equipped with ambient [[structure]] that [[spontaneous symmetry breaking|breaks]] the diffeomorphism symmetry. Notably systems like [[electromagnetism]] or [[Yang-Mills theory]] have traditionally been written in a non-generally covariant form describing gauge fields on a fixed gravitational background, as for instance the space inhabited by a particle accelerator. This ambient structure on the spacetime $X$ breaks its general diffeomorphism invariance and hence the effective resulting theory on this background is not generally covariant (a special case of the general phenomenon of [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]]). 

On the other hand, such a model consisting of background (e.g. the particle accelerator) and quantum fields propagating in it is ultimately to be understood as an approximation to a more encompassing model in which also the background is dynamical, and which is again generally covariant. Specific for electromagnetism and Yang-Mills theory this refined generally covariant model is known as _[[Einstein-Maxwell theory]]_ or more generally _[[Einstein-Yang-Mills theory]]_.

The idea of general covariance has a long and convoluted history and the literature witnesses plenty of disagreement about how to interpret and formalize it in technical detail ([Norton](#Norton)). Already early arguments by [[Einstein]] himself (e.g. the "hole paradox" ([Einstein-Grossmann](#EinsteinGrossmann))) show that the discussion has suffered from the beginning from lack of the basic [[category theory|category theoretic]] concept  of [[isomorphism]]  in the [[category]] [[Diff]] of [[smooth manifolds]]. Below in _[Formalization in homotopy type theory](#InHomotopyTypeTheory)_ we indicate a formalization of general covariance that is general, fundamental, and accurately reflects the role of the term in theoretical physics.


## History and original formulation
 {#HistoryAndOriginalFormulation}

> The question of general covariance of physical theories in space and time can be traced back to the famous debate between [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] and [[Samuel Clarke]] (the latter assisted by Sir [[Isaac Newton]]) on the [[ontology|ontological]] status of space in the years 1715–1716 ([Alexander](#Alexander)), the central question being if space exists as a substance or as an absolute being and absolute motion is present (Clarke) or if it is constituted only in relation to co-existent things allowing for relativism in motions only (Leibniz). This kind of problems also played an important role when the general theory of relativity was being developed in the years around 1910. While [[Albert Einstein]] first characterized generally covariant field equations as inadmissible since they did not determine the [[Riemannian metric|metric field]] uniquely as shown in the hole argument ( _Lochbetrachtung_ ) in the appendix of ([Einstein-Grossmann](#EinsteinGrossmann)), he later accepted ([Einstein 1916](#Einstein1916)) that all [[physical laws]] had to be expressed by [[equations]] that are valid in all [[coordinate systems]], i. e., which are covariant (generally covariant) under arbitrary [[substitution|substitutions]]. 

>> _Die allgemeinen Naturgesetze sind durch Gleichungen auszudrücken, die für alle Koordinatensysteme gelten, d. h. die beliebigen Substitutionen gegenüber kovariant (allgemein kovariant) sind._ ([Einstein 1916 p. 776](#Einstein1916))

> The hole argument was dismissed by the reasoning that it is not the [[spacetime]] [[Riemannian metric|metric]] that has to be fixed uniquely by the [[equations of motion|field equations]], but only the physical phenomena that occur in spacetime need to be given a unique expression with reference to any description of spacetime. All physical statements are given in terms of spacetime coincidences; [[measurement|measurements]] result in statements on meetings of material points of the measuring rods with other material points or in coincidences between watch hands and points on the clockface. The introduction of a reference system merely serves the easy description of the totality of all these coincidences (point-coincidence argument) ([Einstein 1916 p. 776f](#Einstein1916)).

## Formalization in homotopy type theory
 {#InHomotopyTypeTheory}

We discuss how to formalize the notion of general covariance in [[homotopy type theory]], hence internal to any [[(∞,1)-topos]]. For exposition, background and further details on the discussion of [[classical field theory|classical]]/[[quantum field theory]] in this fashion see ([Schreiber, ESI lectures](#SchreiberLectures)) and ([Schreiber-Shulman](#SchreiberShulman)).

### The ambient theory

Write $\mathbf{H}$ for the ambient [[homotopy type theory]], or rather an [[categorical semantics|interpretation]] given by an [[(∞,1)-topos]].
For standard applications in [[physics]] we have $\mathbf{H} = $ [[Smooth∞Grpd]] or [[SmoothSuper∞Grpd]] or similar, but none of the following general discussion depends on a concrete choice for $\mathbf{H}$.

Pick once and for all an [[object]] 

$$
  \Sigma \in \mathbf{H}
$$
 
supposed to represent the [[space]] underlying [[spacetime]] or the [[worldvolume]] of a [[model (in theoretical physics)]], 

### The diffeomorphism group

Write 

$$
  \mathbf{Aut}(\Sigma) \in Grp(\mathbf{H})
$$ 

for the [[automorphism ∞-group]] of $\Sigma$. As discussed there, this is the [[loop space object]] of the  [[homotopy image]]-factorization of

$$
  * \stackrel{\vdash \Sigma}{\to} Type
  \,,
$$

hence the factorization by an  [[effective epimorphism in an (infinity,1)-category|effective epimorphism]] followed by a [[monomorphism in an (infinity,1)-category|monomorphism]]:

$$
  * \stackrel{}{\to} \mathbf{B}\mathbf{Aut}(\Sigma) \hookrightarrow Type
  \,.
$$

In the standard [[categorical semantics|interpretation]] of the homotopy type theory in $\mathbf{H} = $ [[Smooth∞Grpd]] $\Sigma$ could be an ordinary [[smooth manifold]] or [[orbifold]], in particular, and then $\mathbf{Aut}(\Sigma) = \mathbf{\Diff}(\Sigma)$ is the [[diffeomorphism group]] of $\Sigma$, regarded as a [[diffeological space|diffeological]] [[group object]]. In view of this archetypical example we will in the following often say _[[diffeomorphism]]_ for short instead of _auto-equivalence in $\mathbf{H}$_ and similarly refer to $\mathbf{Aut}(\Sigma)$ loosely as the _diffeomorphism group_ of $\Sigma$. But even in the specifical model $\mathbf{H} = $ [[Smooth∞Grpd]]/[[SmoothSuper∞Grpd]], $\Sigma$ can be much more general than a [[smooth manifold]] or [[supermanifold]] or [[orbifold]]. 

### The context of general covariance

Write then $\mathbf{B} \mathbf{Aut}(\Sigma) \in \mathbf{H}$ for the [[delooping]] of the diffeomorphism group.
By the discussion at _[[∞-action]]_, the [[context]] of this type

$$
  \Sigma : \mathbf{B} \mathbf{Aut}(\Sigma) \vdash \cdots
  \,,
$$

hence the [[slice (∞,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}\mathbf{Aut}(\Sigma)}$ is the context of objects in $\mathbf{H}$ equipped with $G$-[[∞-actions]] and with $G$-[[equivariance|equivariant]] [[morphisms]] between them:

$$
  \mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}\mathbf{Aut}(\Sigma)}
  \simeq
  Act_{\mathbf{H}}(\mathbf{Aut}(\Sigma))
  \,.
$$

Hence a [[type in context]] $\mathbf{B}\mathbf{Aut}(\Sigma)$ is a "generally covariant type" with respect to $\Sigma$ in the sense that it transforms [[covariant functor|covariantly]] by equivalences under diffeomorphisms of $\Sigma$. Hence $\mathbf{B}\mathbf{Aut}(\Sigma)$ _is the [[context]] of general covariance_ with respect to $\Sigma$ -- in the precise formal sense.

In particular, $\Sigma$ itself is canonically equipped with the defining action of $\mathbf{Aut}(\Sigma)$ on it, exhibited by the universal  [[associated ∞-bundle|associated]] $\Sigma$-[[fiber ∞-bundle]]

$$
  \array{
    \Sigma &\to& \Sigma \sslash \mathbf{Aut}(\Sigma)
    \\
    && \downarrow^{\overline{\rho_{\Sigma}}}
    \\
    && \mathbf{B} \mathbf{Aut}(\Sigma)
  }
  \,,
$$

guven by the [[pullback]] of the [[universe]] $\widetilde Type \to Type$ along the [[monomorphism in an (infinity,1)-category|inclusion]] $\mathbf{B}\mathbf{Aut} \hookrightarrow Type$.

Here the total space $\Sigma \sslash \mathbf{Aut}(\Sigma) = \sum_{\mathbf{B}G} \rho_\Sigma$ is the [[homotopy quotient]] or [[action groupoid]] of $\Sigma$ by $\mathbf{Aut}(\Sigma)$. This is the type characterized by the fact that a [[function]] $f : U \to \Sigma \sslash \mathbf{Aut}(\Sigma)$ is a function to $\Sigma$ which is regarded as ([[gauge equivalence|gauge]]) [[equivalence|equivalent]] to another function to $\Sigma$ if both differ by postcomposition with a diffeomorphism of $\Sigma$.


### Generally covariant field configuration spaces

Let 

$$
  \mathbf{Fields} \in \mathbf{H}
$$ 

be an object that represent the [[moduli ∞-stack]] of field configuration on $\Sigma$ for the given [[model (in theoretical physics)]]. For instance for $G \in Grp(\mathbf{H})$ an [[∞-group]] and $\mathbf{H}$ a [[cohesive homotopy type theory]], we could have $\mathbf{Fields} = \mathbf{B}G_{conn}$ the moduli for a choice of $G$-[[connection on an ∞-bundle|principel ∞-connection]], being the moduli for $G$-([[higher gauge theory|higher]])[[gauge fields]]. For general $\mathbf{Fields} = X \in \mathbf{H}$ we may always regard $X$ as the [[target space]] of a [[sigma-model]].

Then the [[internal hom]] 

$$
  [\Sigma, \mathbf{Fields}] \in \mathbf{H}
$$ 

hence the [[function type]]

$$
  \vdash \Sigma \to \mathbf{Fields} : Type
$$

is the _naive_ [[configuration space]] of the model. This is not generally covariant, precisely so by the above definition: it is not in the generally covariant context $\mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B} \mathbf{Aut}(\Sigma)}$.

But by the [[inverse image]] of the $\mathbf{B}\mathbf{Aut}(\Sigma)$-[[dependent product]] [[étale geometric morphism]]

$$
  \mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}G}
  \stackrel{\overset{\sum_{\mathbf{B}\mathbf{Aut}(\Sigma)}}{\to}}{
  \stackrel{\overset{}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\prod_{\mathbf{B}\mathbf{Aut}(\Sigma)}}{\to}}}
  \mathbf{H}
$$
 
the moduli type $\mathbf{Fields}$ is freely moved to the general covariant context, where it is regaded as equipped with the [trivial ∞-action](infinity-action#TrivialAction). Accordingly we will write just $\mathbf{Fields} \in \mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}\mathbf{Aut}(\Sigma)}$, with that action understood.

We may then form the _configuration space of fields in the generally covariant context_ precisely by forming the internal space of fields

$$
  \phi : \Sigma \sslash \mathbf{Aut}(\Sigma) \to \mathbf{Fields}
$$

in the general covariant context by

$$
  \mathbf{Conf} 
    \coloneqq
  [\Sigma \sslash \mathbf{Aut}(\Sigma), \mathbf{Fields}]
  \in
  \mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{Aut}(\Sigma)}
  \,,
$$

hence by forming the [[type in context]]

$$
  \Sigma : \mathbf{B} \mathbf{Aut}(\Sigma)
  \vdash
  \Sigma \sslassh \mathbf{Aut}(\Sigma) \to X
  : Type
  \,.
$$



The central observation now is (discussed at [infinity-action -- Examples -- General covariance](infinity-action#GeneralCovariance)) that:

$$
  \mathbf{Conf} \simeq [\Sigma,\mathbf{Fields}] \sslash \mathbf{Aut}(\Sigma)
$$

is the [[homotopy quotient]] of the naive fields $\in \mathbf{Fields}(\Sigma)$ by the action of the [[diffeomorphism group]], exhibiting a [[gauge equivalence]] between any two field configurations that differ after pullback along a diffeomorphism.



### Generally covariant field of gravity

Specifically for pure [[gravity]], $\mathbf{H} = $ [[Smooth∞Grpd]] and  the fields are [[orthogonal structures]] ([[Riemannian metrics]]) on a [[smooth manifold]] $\Sigma \in $ [[SmoothMfd]] $\hookrightarrow \mathbf{H}$ of [[dimension]] $n$. As discussed at _[[orthogonal structure]]_ and _[[vielbein]]_, we are to regard $\Sigma$ in the [[context]] of the [[delooping]] of the [[general linear group]] $GL(n) \in Grp(\mathbf{H})$ via its [[tangent bundle]]

$$
  (\Sigma \stackrel{T \Sigma}{\to} \mathbf{B} GL(n))
  \in
  \mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B} GL(n)}
  \,.
$$

(A detailed exposition of this and the following, with further pointers, is in ([Schreiber, ESI lectures](#SchreiberLectures)).)

Write

$$
  (\mathbf{B} O(n) \stackrel{\mathbf{orth}}{\to} \mathbf{B} GL(n)) 
  \in 
  \mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}GL(n)}
$$

for the delooping of the inclusion of the [[maximal compact subgroup]], the [[orthogonal group]] $O(n)$. Then the [[moduli stack]] of [[vielbein]] fields /  [[Riemannian metrics]] on $\Sigma$ is

$$
  [T \Sigma, \mathbf{orth}] \in \mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}GL(n)}
  \,.
$$

This is still the naive space of fields, not generally covariant. So we next pass again to the general covariant $\mathbf{B}\mathbf{Aut}(\Sigma)$-[[context]] and form the correct generally covariant space of fields, being the [[type in context]] $\mathbf{B} \mathbf{Aut}(T \Sigma)$ given by

$$
  T \Sigma : \mathbf{B} \mathbf{Aut}(T \Sigma)
  \vdash 
  T \Sigma \sslash \mathbf{Aut}(T \Sigma)
  \to 
  \mathbf{orth} : Type
  \,.
$$

By the above general fact this yields the configuration space

$$
  \mathbf{Conf}
  \coloneqq
  \sum_{\mathbf{B}\mathbf{Aut}(T \Sigma)} [T \Sigma \sslash \mathbf{Aut}(T \Sigma), \mathbf{orth}]_{\mathbf{B} Aut(T \Sigma)}
  \simeq
  [T \Sigma, \mathbf{orth}] \sslash \mathbf{Aut}(T \Sigma)
  \in \mathbf{H}
  \,,
$$

which is the integrated BRST complex of Einstein gravity field configurations modulo diffeomorphism ghosts: the [[smooth infinity-groupoid|smooth groupoid]] whose 

* [[objects]] are [[vielbein]] fields $e$ on $X$;

* [[morphisms]] are

  1. orthogonal frame transformations of the fibers of the tangent bundle;

  1. general diffeomorphisms of the base $\Sigma$.
