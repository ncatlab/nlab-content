## Idea

What is called the _maybe monad_ is a simple [[monad (in computer science)]] which is used to implement "exceptions" indicating the failure of a computation in terms of [[functional programming]].

On the type system the [[maybe monad]] is the operation $X \mapsto X \coprod \ast$. 

The idea here is that a function $X \longrightarrow Y$ in its [[Kleisli category]] is in the original category a function of the form $X \longrightarrow Y \coprod \ast $ so either returns indeed a value in $Y$ or else returns the unique element of the [[unit type]]/[[terminal object]] $\ast$. This is then naturally interpreted as "no value returned", hence as indicating a "failure in computation".

### Relation to pointed objects

The [[algebra over a monad|algebras]] over the maybe monad are [[pointed objects]].

### Relation to natural number objects

Regarding just the underlying [[endofunctor]] of the maybe monad, its [[initial algebra over an endofunctor]] is a [[natural numbers object]].
