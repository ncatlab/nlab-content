## Idea

What is called the _maybe monad_ is a simple [[monad (in computer science)]] which is used to implement "exceptions" indicating the failure of a computation in terms of [[functional programming]].

On the type system the [[maybe monad]] is the operation $X \mapsto X \coprod \ast$. 

The idea here is that a function $X \longrightarrow Y$ in its [[Kleisli category]] is in the original category a function of the form $X \longrightarrow Y \coprod \ast $ so either returns indeed a value in $Y$ or else returns the unique element of the [[unit type]]/[[terminal object]] $\ast$ -- it is a _[[partial function]]_. The latter case is naturally interpreted as "no value returned", hence as indicating a "failure in computation".

## Properties

> under construction

### Kleisli category

The [[Kleisli category]] of the maybe monad is the category whose objects are the original objects, and whose morphisms are the [[partial functions]] in the original category.

### EM-category and Relation to pointed objects
 {#EMCategoryAndRelationToPointedObjects}

The [[algebra over a monad|algebras]] over the maybe monad are  [[pointed objects]]. 

Moreover, the maybe monad is a [[monoidal monad]] and (by the discussion at _[[commutative monad]]_, see also ([Seal 12](#Seal12))), so that (in a sufficiently nice category such as a [[topos]]) its [[Eilenberg-Moore category]] of algebras canonically inherits the structure of a [[monoidal category]], and one finds that this is the [[smash product]] of pointed objects.

### Relation to natural number objects

Regarding just the underlying [[endofunctor]] of the maybe monad, its [[initial algebra over an endofunctor]] is a [[natural numbers object]].
