
I am a [[mathematics|mathematician]] specializing in [[category theory]]. My PhD was completed in 1994 under the direction of [[Myles Tierney]], and centered on categorical [[coherence relation|coherence]] problems and their relation to [[categorical logic]]. Subsequently I spent a few years in Sydney working with [[Ross Street]], mainly on [[higher-dimensional categories]], and then spent a few years in Chicago; the Chicago category seminar at the University of Chicago was founded during my stay. 

In 2001 I left academe to become a full-time parent, continuing to do mathematics as time allows. Part of those activities include participating in the [$n$-Category Caf√©](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/) blog, and at one time coauthoring the mathematics blog [Topological Musings](http://topologicalmusings.wordpress.com). Since late 2013 I have also been a moderator at [MathOverflow](http://mathoverflow.net/questions). 

Starting in January 2019 I hold a temporary appointment as Assistant Professor at Western Connecticut State University.
