## Idea

Given a [[smooth manifold]] $U$ and a [[Lie 3-algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$, the 3-groupoid of Lie 3-algebra valued forms over $U$ has as objects [[schreiber:∞-Lie algebroid valued differential forms]] with values in $\mathfrak{g}$, as morphisms gauge transformations of these, as 2-morphisms 2-gauge transformations and so on.

This can be understood as the 3-groupoid of _trivial_ $G$-[[principal ∞-bundle|principal 3-bundle]]s over $U$ with nontrivial connection, for $G$ the [[∞-Lie groupoid|3-Lie grouop]] related to $\mathfrak{g}$ by [[Lie integration]].

Regarded as a presheaf of 3-groupoids over all suitable manifolds $U$, this is a non-concrete [[∞-Lie groupoid|3-Lie groupoid]].
