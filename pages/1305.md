For many topologists, analysts and so on, word compact means "a compact Hausdorff space". Some older topological schools distinguish a "compact space" (not necessarily including Hausdorff property) and "compactum" (which does); and similarly a "paracompact space" and "paracompactum". In algebraic geometry ,one often used terminology __quasicompact space__ to denote a topological space which is compact and not necessarily Hausdorff. Indeed, the Zariski topology on an algebraic variety and the topology of an etale space of a sheaf are typically not Hausdorff. More important, there is a relative version, namely the notion of a __quasicompact morphism__ of schemes (will include more details later). 
A scheme is quasicompact iff it has a Zariski cover by finitely many open affine subschemes. In particular, any affine scheme is quasicompact. 

Algebraic geometers sometimes also talk about __quasicompact objects__ in more general categories, meaning [[compact object]]s (object which corepresent covariant functors commuting with filtered colimits); with or without a modifier denoting a cardinal ($\kappa$-quasicompact objects).

[[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: To accord with terminological conventions, this page should probably be either "quasicompact space" or "quasicompact object."
