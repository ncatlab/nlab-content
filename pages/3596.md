> The first original law of thought ([WdL §875](Science+of+Logic#875)): everything is identical with itself ([WdL §863](Science+of+Logic#863)), no two things are like each other ([WdL §903](Science+of+Logic#903)).

## Idea

In [[intensional type theory]] under the [[propositions as types]] paradigm, an **identity type** (or **equality type**) is the incarnation of [[equality]].  That is, for any [[type]] $A$ and any [[terms]] $x,y:A$, the type $Id_A(x,y)$ is "the type of [[proofs]] that $x=y$" or "the type of reasons why $x=y$".

To contrast with "computational" or [[definitional equality]], sometimes inhabitation of an identity type is sometimes called **propositional equality**.  The identity type $Id_A(x,y)$ is sometimes written $Eq_A(x,y)$ or just $(x=y)$, but in this article we reserve the latter for definitional equality.

In *[[extensional type theory|extensional]]* type theory, such as that modeled in the [[internal logic]] of a 1-category, equality is an [[h-proposition]], and hence each $Id_A(x,y)$ is a [[subsingleton]].  However, in the internal type theory of [[higher category theory|higher categories]], such as the [[internal logic of an (∞,1)-topos]], identity types represent [[path objects]] and are highly nontrivial.  One speaks of _[[homotopy type theory]]_.  In these cases, one may write for instance $Path_A(x,y)$ instead of $Id_A(x,y)$.


## Definition
 {#Definition}

The definition of identity types was originally given in explicit form by [[Per Martin-Löf|Martin-Löf]], in terms of introduction and elimination rules.  Later, it was realized that this was a special case of the general notion of [[inductive type]].  We will discuss both formulations.

* [with introduction and elimination rules](#ExplicitDefinition).

* [in terms of inductive types](#InTermsOfInductiveTypes) 

### With introduction and elimination rules
 {#ExplicitDefinition}

The rules for forming identity types and terms are as follows (expressed in [[sequent calculus]]).  First the rule that defines the identity type itself, as a [[dependent type]], in some [[context]] $\Gamma$.

**[[type formation]]**

$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A:Type}
{\Gamma, x:A, y:A \vdash Id_A(x,y):Type}$$


Now the basic "introduction" rule, which says that everything is equal to itself in a canonical way.

**[[term introduction]]**

$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A:Type}
{\Gamma, x:A \vdash r(x) : Id_A(x,x)}$$

To a category theorist, it might be more natural to call this $1_X$.  The traditional notation $r(x)$ indicates that this is a canonical proof of the *reflexivity* of equality.

Then we have the "elimination" rule, which is easily the most subtle and powerful.

**[[term elimination]]**

$$\frac{\Gamma, x:A, y:A, p:Id_A(x,y), \Delta(x,y,p) \vdash C(x,y,p):Type \qquad
\Gamma, x:A, \Delta(x,x,r(x)) \vdash t : C(x,x,r(x))}
{\Gamma, x:A, y:A, p:Id_A(x,y), \Delta(x,y,p) \vdash J(t;x,y,p) : C(x,y,p)}$$

Ignore the presence of the additional context $\Delta$ for now; it is unnecessary if we also have [[dependent product type]]s.  The elimination rule then says that if:

1. for any $x,y:A$ and any reason $p:Id_A(x,y)$ why they are the same, we have a type $C(x,y,p)$, and
1. if $x$ and $y$ are actually identical and $p:Id_A(x,x)$ is the reflexivity proof $r(x)$, then we have a specified term $t:C(x,x,r(x))$,

then we can construct a canonically defined term $J(t;x,y,p):C(x,y,p)$ for *any* $x$, $y$, and $p:Id_A(x,y)$, by "transporting" the term $t$ along the proof of equality $p$.  In homotopical or categorical models, this can be viewed as a "path-lifting" property, i.e. that the [[display map]]s are some sort of [[fibration]].  This can be made precise with the [[identity type weak factorization system]].

A particular case is when $C$ is a term representing a proposition according to the propositions-as-types philosophy.  In this case, the elimination rule says that in order to prove a statement is true about all $x,y,p$, it suffices to prove it in the special case for $x,x,r(x)$.

Finally, we have the "computation" or [[β-reduction]] rule.  This says that if we substitute along a reflexivity proof, nothing happens.

**[[computation rule]]**

$$\frac{\Gamma, x:A, y:A, p:Id_A(x,y), \Delta(x,y,p) \vdash C(x,y,p):Type \qquad
\Gamma, x:A, \Delta(x,x,r(x)) \vdash t : C(x,x,r(x))}
{\Gamma, x:A, \Delta(x,x,r(x)) \vdash J(t;x,x,r(x)) = t}$$

Note that the equality $=$ in the conclusion of the computation rule is [[definitional equality]], not an instance of the identity/equality type itself.

These rules may seem a little ad-hoc, but they are actually a particular case of the general notion of [[inductive type]].


### In terms of inductive types
 {#InTermsOfInductiveTypes}

Using [[inductive types]] the notion of identity types is encoded in a single line. In [[Coq]] notation we can say

    Inductive id {A} : A -> A -> Type := idpath : forall x, id x x.   

In other words, the identity type of $A$ is inductively generated by reflexivity, in the same way that the [[natural numbers]] are inductively generated by [[zero]] and [[successor]].  From this, the above introduction, elimination, and computation rules are all derived automatically.

This is the approach to identity types taken by practical work in [[homotopy type theory]], which is usually implemented in [[Coq]] or [[Agda]].  See, for instance, [Overture.v](#Overturev)

An essentially equivalent way to give the definition, due to Paulin-Mohring, is

    Inductive id {A} (x:A) : A -> Type := idpath : id x x.   

The difference here is that now $x$ is a *parameter* of the inductive definition rather than an *index*.  In other words, the first definition says "for each type $A$, we have an type $Id_A$ dependent on $A\times A$, inductively defined by a constructor $idpath$ which takes an element $x\colon A$ as input and yields output in $Id_A(x,x)$" while the second definition says "for each type $A$ and each element $x\colon A$, we have a type $Id_A(x)$ dependent on $A$, inductively defined by a constructor $idpath$ which takes *no* input and yields output in $Id_A(x)(x)$."  The two formulations can be proven equivalent, but sometimes one is more convenient than the other.


### Extensionality and $\eta$-conversion
 {#EtaConversion}

Almost all types in type theory can be given both [[β-reduction]] and [[η-reduction]] rules.  $\beta$-reduction specifies what happens when we apply an eliminator to a term obtained by a constructor; $\eta$-reduction specifies the reverse.  Above we have formulated only the $\beta$-reduction rule for identity types; the $\eta$-conversion rule would be the following:

$$\frac{\Gamma, x:A, y:A, p:Id_A(x,y), \Delta(x,y,p) \vdash C(x,y,p):Type \qquad
\Gamma, x:A, y:A, p:Id_A(x,y), \Delta(x,x,r(x)) \vdash t : C(x,y,p)}
{\Gamma, x:A, y:A, p:Id_A(x,y), \Delta(x,y,p) \vdash J(t[y/x, r(x)/p];x,y,p) = t}$$

This says that if $C$ is a type which we can use the eliminator $J$ to construct a term of, but we already *have* a term $t$ of that type, then if we restrict $t$ to reflexivity inputs and then apply $J$ to construct a term of type $C$, the result is the same as the term $t$ we started with.  As in the $\beta$-reduction rule, the $=$ in the conclusion refers to [[definitional equality]].

This $\eta$-conversion rule has some very strong consequences.  For instance, suppose $x\colon A$, $y\colon A$, and $p\colon Id_A(x,y)$, and let $C \coloneqq A$.  Then with $t=x$, the $\eta$-conversion rule tells us that $x = J(x[y/x,r(x)/p];x,y,p)$.  And with $t=y$, the $\eta$-conversion rule tells us that $y = J(y[y/x,r(x)/p];x,y,p)$.  But substituting $y$ for $x$ (and $r(x)$ for $p$) in the term $y$ simply yields the term $x$, which is the same as the result of substituting $y$ for $x$ and $r(x)$ for $p$ in the term $x$.  Thus, we have

$$x = J(x;x,y,p) = y$$

In other words, if $Id_A(x,y)$ is inhabited (that is, $x$ and $y$ are propositionally equal) then in fact $x$ and $y$ are definitionally equal.  Moreover, by a similar argument we can show that

$$p = J(p[y/x, r(x)/p];x,y,p) = J(r(x)[y/x,r(x)/p];x,y,p) = r(x).$$

(Here we are eliminating into the type $C(x,y,p) \coloneqq Id_A(x,y)$.  The term $r(x)$ may be regarded as belonging to this type, because we have already shown that $x$ and $y$ are *definitionally* equal.)

Thus, the definitional $\eta$-conversion rule for identity types implies that the type theory is [[extensional type theory|extensional]] in a very strong sense.  (This was observed already in ([Streicher](#Streicher)).)  For this reason, in [[homotopy type theory]] we do not assume the $\eta$-conversion rule for identity types.

This sort of extensionality in type theory is also problematic for non-homotopical reasons: since type-checking in dependent type theory depends on definitional equality, but the above rule implies that definitional equality depends on inhabitation of identity types, this makes definitional equality and hence type-checking *undecidable* in the formal computational sense.  Thus, $\eta$-conversion for identity types is often omitted (as in [[Coq]]).

On the other hand, it is possible to prove a *propositional* version of $\eta$-conversion using only the identity types as defined above without definitional $\eta$-conversion.  In other words, given the hypotheses of the above $\eta$-conversion rule, we can construct a term belonging to the type

$$ Id_{C(x,y,p)}(J(t[y/x, r(x)/p];x,y,p), t). $$

This has none of the bad consequences of definitional $\eta$-conversion, and in particular does not imply that the type theory is extensional.  The argument that $p\colon Id_A(x,y)$ implies $x=y$ becomes the tautologous statement that if $p\colon Id_A(x,y)$ then $p\colon Id_A(x,y)$, while the subsequent argument that $p= r(x)$ fails because $x$ and $y$ are no longer *definitionally* equal, so $r(x)$ does not have type $Id_A(x,y)$.  We can *transport* it along $p$ to obtain a term of this type, but then we obtain only that $p$ is equal to the transport of $r(x)$ along $p$, which is a perfectly intensional/homotopical statement.


## Categorical semantics

We discuss the [[categorical semantics]] for identity types in the extensional case, and identity types in the [[categorical semantics of homotopy type theory]] in the intensional case.


In categorical models of [[extensional type theory]], generally every [[morphism]] of the category is allowed to represent a [[dependent type]], and the extensional identity types are represented by [[diagonal]] maps $A\to A\times A$.

By contrast, in models of [[intensional type theory]], there is only a particular class of [[display maps]] or [[fibrations]] which are allowed to represent dependent types, and intensional identity types are represented by [[path objects]] $P A \to A \times A$.

Both of these cases apply in particular to models in the [[category of contexts]] of the type theory itself, i.e. the [[term model]].

### Prerequisites

By the standard construction of [[mapping path spaces]] out of 
[[path space objects]], the existence of identity types allows one to construct a [[weak factorization system]].

Conversely, since any weak factorization system gives rise to [[path objects]] by factorization of [[diagonal maps]], one may hope to construct a [[model]] of type theory with identity types in a category equipped with a WFS $(L,R)$.  There are four obstacles in the way of such a construction.

1. In order to handle the additional [[context]] $\Delta$ in the explicit definition above, it turns out to be necessary to assume that $L$-maps are preserved by [[pullback]] along $R$-maps between $R$-objects.  (Such a condition is also necessary in order to interpret type-theoretic [[dependent products]] in a [[locally cartesian closed category]].)

1. This enables us to define identity types with their elimination and computation rules "locally", i.e. for each type individually.  However, every construction in type theory is stable under [[substitution]].  This means that if $y\colon Y\vdash A(y)\colon Type$ is a dependent type and $f\colon X\to Y$ is a morphism, then the identity type $x\colon X \vdash Id_{A(f(x))}(-,-)\colon Type$ is the same whether we first construct $Id_{A(y)}$ and then substitute $f(x)$ for $y$, or first substitute $f(x)$ for $y$ to obtain $A(f(x))$ and then construct its identity type.  In order for this to hold up to isomorphism, we need to require that the WFS have *stable path objects* --- a choice of path object data in each slice category which is preserved by pullback.  In [(Warren)](#Warren) it is shown that any [[simplicial model category]] in which the [[cofibrations]] are the [[monomorphisms]] can be equipped with stable path objects, while [(Garner-van den Berg)](#vdBergGarner) it is shown that the presence of internal path-categories also suffices.

1. The eliminator term $J$ of identity types in type theory is also preserved by substitution.  This imposes an additional *[[coherence]]* requirement which is tricky to obtain categorically.  See the references by [Warren](#Warren) and [Garner-van den Berg](#vdBergGarner) for methods that ensure this, such as by invoking an [[algebraic weak factorization system]].  It can also be handled *a la* [[Vladimir Voevodsky|Voevodsky]] by using a (possibly [[univalence axiom|univalent]]) [[universe]].

1. Finally, substitution in type theory is strictly functorial/[[associativity|associative]], whereas it is modeled categorically by pullback which is generally not strictly so.  This is a general issue with the categorical interpretation of [[dependent type theory]], not something specific to identity types.  It can be resolved by passing to a [[split fibration]] which is equivalent to the [[codomain fibration]], or by making use of a [[universe]].  See [[categorical model of dependent types]].

### Interpretation in a type-theoretic model category

Assume then that a category $\mathcal{C}$ with suitable WFSs has been chosen, for instance a [[type-theoretic model category]]. Then

* The interpretation of a type $ \vdash A : Type$ is as a [[fibrant object]] $[\vdash A : Type]$ which we will just write "$A$" for short. 

* **type formation** 
  
  The identity type $a, b : A \vdash Id_A(a,b) : Type$ is interpreted as [[generalized the|the]] [[path space object]] [[fibration]] 
  
  $$
    \array{
       A^I
       \\
       \downarrow
       \\
       A \times A
    }
  $$

* **term introduction**

  By definition of [[path space object]], there exists a lift $\sigma$ in 
  
  $$
    \array{
       && A^I
       \\
       & {}^{\mathllap{\sigma}}\nearrow& \downarrow
       \\
       A &\stackrel{(id,id)}{\to}& A \times A
    }
    \,.
  $$

  By the [[universal property]] of the [[pullback]] this is equivalently a [[section]] of the [[pullback]] of the path space object along the [[diagonal]] morphism $(id,id) : A \to A \times A$.

  $$
    \array{
       && (id,id)^* A^I &\to& A^I
       \\
       &{}^{\mathllap{\sigma}}\nearrow& \downarrow & & \downarrow
       \\
       A &=& A &\stackrel{(id,id)}{\to}& A \times A
    }
    \,.
  $$

  Since $(id, id)^* A^I$ is the interpretation of the [[substitution]]  
  $a : A \vdash Id_A (a,a) : Type$ in this sense $\sigma$ is now the interpretation of a term $a : A \vdash r_A : Id_A (a,a)$. 

* **term elemination**

  A type depending on an identity type

  $$
    a, b : A, p : Id_A(a,b) \vdash C(a,b,p)
  $$

  is interpreted as a [[fibration]]

  $$
    \array{
      C
      \\
      \downarrow
      \\
      A^I
    }
    \,.
  $$

  The [[substitution]] $C(a,a,r_a)$ is interpreted by the [[pullback]]

  $$
    \array{
      (id,id)^* C &\to& C
      \\
      \downarrow && \downarrow
      \\
      A &\stackrel{(id,id)}{\to}& A \times A
    }
    \,.
  $$

  Therefore a [[term]] $t : C(a,a,r_a)$ is interpreted as a [[section]] of this pullback

  $$
    \array{
      && (id,id)^* C &\to& C
      \\
      &{}^{\mathllap{t}}\nearrow& \downarrow && \downarrow
      \\
      A &=& A &\stackrel{(id,id)}{\to}& A \times A
    }
    \,.
  $$

  By the [[universal property]] of the pullback, this is equivalently a morphism $t$ in 

  $$
    \array{
      && C
      \\
      & {}^{\mathllap{t}}\nearrow & \downarrow
      \\
      A &\stackrel{(id,id)}{\to}& A \times A
    }
    \,.
  $$

  The elimination rule says that given such $t$, there exists a compatible section of $C \to Id_A$. If we redraw the previous diagram as a square, then this section is a _[[lifting problem|lift]]_ in that diagram

  $$
    \array{   
      A &\to& C
      \\
      {}^{\mathllap{r}}\downarrow &\nearrow& \downarrow
      \\
      A^I &=& A^I
    }
    \,.
  $$

  In particular, if $C$ itself is the pullback of a fibration $D \to B$ along a morphism $A^I \to B$, then $r$ has the left lifting property also against that fibration

  $$
    \array{   
      A &\to& C &\to& D
      \\
      {}^{\mathllap{r}}\downarrow &\nearrow& \downarrow && \downarrow
      \\
      A^I &=& A^I &\to& B
    }
    \,.
  $$

  So the term elimination rule says that the interpretaton $A \to A^I$ of $a : A \vdash r(a) : Id_A (a,a)$ has the [[left lifting property]] against all fibrations, hence that $A \to A^I$ is to be interpreted as an acyclic cofibration.

 

### Weak $\omega$-groupoids

Some of the first work noticing the homotopical / higher-categorical interpretation of identity types (see below) focused on the fact that the tower of iterated identity types of a type has the structure of an internal *[[algebraic definition of higher categories|algebraic]]* [[ω-groupoid]].

In retrospect, this is roughly an algebraic version of the standard fact that every object of a model category (or more generally a [[category of fibrant objects]] or a category with a weak factorization system) admits a [[simplicial resolution]] which is an [[internalization|internal]] [[Kan complex]], i.e. a nonalgebraic $\infty$-groupoid.  Note, however, that the first technical condition above (stability of $L$-maps under pullback along $R$-maps) seems to be necessary for the algebraic version of the result to go through.
