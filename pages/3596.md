## Idea

In [[intensional type theory]] under the [[propositions as types]] paradigm, an **identity type** is the incarnation of [[equality]].  That is, for any [[type]] $A$ and any [[terms]] $x,y:A$, the type $Id_A(x,y)$ is "the type of [[proofs]] that $x=y$" or "the type of reasons why $x=y$".

In *[[extensional type theory|extensional]]* type theory, such as that modeled in the [[internal logic]] of a 1-category, equality is simply a [[proposition]], and hence each $Id_A(x,y)$ is a [[subsingleton]].  However, in the internal type theory of [[higher category theory|higher categories]], such as the [[internal logic of an (∞,1)-topos]], identity types represent [[path objects]] and are highly nontrivial.  One speaks of _[[homotopy type theory]]_. In these cases, one may write for instance $Path_A(x,y)$ instead of $Id_A(x,y)$.


## Definition
 {#Definition}

The definition of identity types was originally given in explicit form by [[Per Martin-Löf|Martin-Löf]], in terms of introduction and elimination rules.  Later, it was realized that this was a special case of the general notion of [[inductive type]].  We will discuss both formulations.

* [with introduction and elimination rules](#ExplicitDefinition).

* [in terms of inductive types](#InTermsOfInductiveTypes) 

### With introduction and elimination rules
 {#ExplicitDefinition}

The rules for forming identity types and terms are as follows (expressed in [[sequent calculus]]).  First the rule that defines the identity type itself, as a [[dependent type]], in some [[context]] $\Gamma$.

$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A:Type}
{\Gamma, x:A, y:A \vdash Id_A(x,y):Type}$$


Now the basic "introduction" rule, which says that everything is equal to itself in a canonical way.

$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A:Type}
{\Gamma, x:A \vdash r(x) : Id_A(x,x)}$$

To a category theorist, it might be more natural to call this $1_X$.  The traditional notation $r(x)$ indicates that this is a canonical proof of the *reflexivity* of equality.

Then we have the "elimination" rule, which is easily the most subtle and powerful.

$$\frac{\Gamma, x:A, y:A, p:Id_A(x,y), \Delta(x,y,p) \vdash C(x,y,p):Type \qquad
\Gamma, x:A, \Delta(x,x,r(x)) \vdash t : C(x,x,r(x))}
{\Gamma, x:A, y:A, p:Id_A(x,y), \Delta(x,y,p) \vdash J(t;x,y,p) : C(x,y,p)}$$

Ignore the presence of the additional context $\Delta$ for now; it is unnecessary if we also have [[dependent product type]]s.  The elimination rule then says that if:

1. for any $x,y:A$ and any reason $p:Id_A(x,y)$ why they are the same, we have a type $C(x,y,p)$, and
1. if $x$ and $y$ are actually identical and $p:Id_A(x,x)$ is the reflexivity proof $r(x)$, then we have a specified term $t:C(x,x,r(x))$,

then we can construct a canonically defined term $J(t;x,y,p):C(x,y,p)$ for *any* $x$, $y$, and $p:Id_A(x,y)$, by "transporting" the term $t$ along the proof of equality $p$.  In homotopical or categorical models, this can be viewed as a "path-lifting" property, i.e. that the [[display map]]s are some sort of [[fibration]].  This can be made precise with the [[identity type weak factorization system]].

A particular case is when $C$ is a term representing a proposition according to the propositions-as-types philosophy.  In this case, the elimination rule says that in order to prove a statement is true about all $x,y,p$, it suffices to prove it in the special case for $x,x,r(x)$.

Finally, we have the "computation" rule, which says that if we substitute along a reflexivity proof, nothing happens.

$$\frac{\Gamma, x:A, y:A, p:Id_A(x,y), \Delta(x,y,p) \vdash C(x,y,p):Type \qquad
\Gamma, x:A, \Delta(x,x,r(x)) \vdash t : C(x,x,r(x))}
{\Gamma, x:A, \Delta(x,x,r(x)) \vdash J(t;x,x,r(x)) = t}$$

These rules may seem a little ad-hoc, but they are actually a particular case of the general notion of [[inductive type]].

### In terms of inductive types
 {#InTermsOfInductiveTypes}

Using [[inductive types]] the notion of identity types is encoded in a single line. In [[Coq]] notation we can say

    Inductive id {A} : A -> A -> Type := idpath : forall x, id x x.   

In other words, the identity type of $A$ is inductively generated by reflexivity, in the same way that the [[natural numbers]] are inductively generated by [[zero]] and [[successor]].  From this, the above introduction, elimination, and computation rules are all derived automatically.

This is the approach to identity types taken by practical work in [[homotopy type theory]], which is usually implemented in [[Coq]] or [[Agda]].  See, for instance, [Paths.v](#Pathsv)

An essentially equivalent way to give the definition, due to Paulin-Mohring, is

    Inductive id {A} (x:A) : A -> Type := idpath : id x x.   

The difference here is that now $x$ is a *parameter* of the inductive definition rather than an *index*.  In other words, the first definition says "for each type $A$, we have an type $Id_A$ dependent on $A\times A$, inductively defined by a constructor $idpath$ which takes an element $x\colon A$ as input and yields output in $Id_A(x,x)$" while the second definition says "for each type $A$ and each element $x\colon A$, we have a type $Id_A(x)$ dependent on $A$, inductively defined by a constructor $idpath$ which takes *no* input and yields output in $Id_A(x)(x)$."  The two formulations can be proven equivalent, but sometimes one is more convenient than the other.


## Categorical semantics

When type theory is considered as an internal language for various kinds of categories, identity types play an important role.

In categorical models of [[extensional type theory]], generally every morphism of the category is allowed to represent a dependent type, and the extensional identity types are represented by [[diagonal]] maps $A\to A\times A$.

By contrast, in models of [[intensional type theory]], there is only a particular class of [[display maps]] or [[fibrations]] which are allowed to represent dependent types, and intensional identity types are represented by [[path objects]] $P A \to A \times A$.

Both of these cases apply in particular to models in the [[category of contexts]] of the type theory itself, i.e. the [[term model]].

### WFS, Stability, and Coherence

By the standard construction of [[mapping path spaces]] out of path objects, the existence of identity types allows one to construct a [[weak factorization system]].

Conversely, since any weak factorization system gives rise to [[path objects]] by factorization of [[diagonal maps]], one may hope to construct a [[model]] of type theory with identity types in a category equipped with a WFS $(L,R)$.  There are four obstacles in the way of such a construction.

1. In order to handle the additional [[context]] $\Delta$ in the explicit definition above, it turns out to be necessary to assume that $L$-maps are preserved by [[pullback]] along $R$-maps between $R$-objects.  (Such a condition is also necessary in order to interpret type-theoretic [[dependent products]] in a [[locally cartesian closed category]].)

1. This enables us to define identity types with their elimination and computation rules "locally", i.e. for each type individually.  However, every construction in type theory is stable under substitution.  This means that if $y\colon Y\vdash A(y)\colon Type$ is a dependent type and $f\colon X\to Y$ is a morphism, then the identity type $x\colon X \vdash Id_{A(f(x))}(-,-)\colon Type$ is the same whether we first construct $Id_{A(y)}$ and then substitute $f(x)$ for $y$, or first substitute $f(x)$ for $y$ to obtain $A(f(x))$ and then construct its identity type.  In order for this to hold up to isomorphism, we need to require that the WFS have *stable path objects* --- a choice of path object data in each slice category which is preserved by pullback.  In [(Warren)](#Warren) it is shown that any [[simplicial model category]] in which the [[cofibrations]] are the [[monomorphisms]] can be equipped with stable path objects, while [(Garner-van den Berg)](#vdBergGarner) it is shown that the presence of internal path-categories also suffices.

1. The eliminator term $J$ of identity types in type theory is also preserved by substitution.  This imposes an additional *[[coherence]]* requirement which is tricky to obtain categorically.  See the references by [Warren](#Warren) and [Garner-van den Berg](#vdBergGarner) for methods that ensure this, such as by invoking an [[algebraic weak factorization system]].  It can also be handled *a la* [[Vladimir Voevodsky|Voevodsky]] by using a (possibly [[univalence axiom|univalent]]) [[universe]].

1. Finally, substitution in type theory is strictly functorial/[[associativity|associative]], whereas it is modeled categorically by pullback which is generally not strictly so.  This is a general issue with the categorical interpretation of [[dependent type theory]], not something specific to identity types.  It can be resolved by passing to a [[split fibration]] which is equivalent to the [[codomain fibration]], or by making use of a [[universe]].

### Weak $\omega$-groupoids

Some of the first work noticing the homotopical / higher-categorical interpretation of identity types (see below) focused on the fact that the tower of iterated identity types of a type has the structure of an internal *[[algebraic definition of higher categories|algebraic]]* [[ω-groupoid]].

In retrospect, this is roughly an algebraic version of the standard fact that every object of a model category (or more generally a [[category of fibrant objects]] or a category with a weak factorization system) admits a [[simplicial resolution]] which is an [[internalization|internal]] [[Kan complex]], i.e. a nonalgebraic $\infty$-groupoid.  Note, however, that the first technical condition above (stability of $L$-maps under pullback along $R$-maps) seems to be necessary for the algebraic version of the result to go through.
