The Kan-Thurston theorem says that every path-connected space is homology equivalent to the classifying space of a discrete group.

## Statement

For every path connected  space $X$ with base point there exists a (Serre) fibration 
$$tX:TX\rightarrow X$$ 
which is natural with respect to X and has the following properties. 

(i) The map $tX$ induces an isomorphism on (singular) homology and cohomology  with local coefficients 

$$H_*(TX;A)\cong H_*(X;A),\;\;  H^*(TX;A)\cong H^*(X;A)$$ 
for every local coeficient system $A$ on $X$, and 

(ii) $\pi_i\;TX$ is trivial for $i\neq 1$ and $tX$ is onto.

Furthermore the homotopy type of $X$ is completely determined by the pair of groups $(G_X, P_X)$ where 
$G_X  = \pi_1TX,\;\; P_X = ker\;\pi_1tX$ and $P_X$ is a perfect subgroup of $G_X$.
