## Idea

The _Kan-Thurston theorem_ says that every [[path-connected topological space]] is [[ordinary homology|homology]]-[[equivalence|equivalent]] to the [[classifying space]] $K(G,1)$ of a [[discrete group]] $G$.

## Statement

For every path connected  space $X$ with base point there exists a ([[Serre fibration|Serre-]])-[[fibration]]

$$
  t X \colon T X \rightarrow X
$$ 

which is natural with respect to $X$ and has the following properties. 

(i) The map $t X$ induces an [[isomorphism]] on ([[singular homology|singular]]-)[[homology]] and [[singular cohomology|cohomology]] with [[local coefficient bundle|local coefficients]]

$$H_*(T X;A)\cong H_*(X;A),\;\;  H^*(T X;A)\cong H^*(X;A)$$ 
for every local coefficient system $A$ on $X$, and 

(ii) $\pi_i\;(T X)$ is trivial for $i\neq 1$ and $\pi_1\;t X$ is onto.

Furthermore the [[homotopy type]] of $X$ is completely determined by the pair of groups $(G_X, P_X)$ where 
$G_X  = \pi_1T X,\;\; P_X = ker\;\pi_1t X$ and $P_X$ is a 
[[perfect group|perfect]] [[normal subgroup|normal]] [[subgroup]] of $G_X$. 

More precisely, $X$ can be recovered, up to homotopy, by applying the [[plus construction]] to $K(G_X,1)$ with respect to $P_X$.
