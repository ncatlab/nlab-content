## Idea

A _locally contractible topological ∞-groupoid_ is an [[∞-groupoid]] equipped with [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos|cohesion]] in the form of [[locally contractible topological space|locally contractible]] [[topology]].

The collection of all these cohesive $\infty$-groupoids forms a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] $LCTop\infty Grpd$. 

This is similarr to [[ETop∞Grpd]], which models cohesibion in the form of [[Euclidean topology]].


## Definition

Let $CTop$ be some small version (...details missing...) of the site of [[locally contractible topological space|locally contractible]] [[contractible space|contractible topological space]]s with [[continuous map]]s betwen them and equpped with the standard [[open cover]] [[coverage]].

This is a [[cohesive site]] (...for the evident generalization of that definitions where Cech covers are generalized to hypercovers...). The key axiom to check is that for $Y \to U$ a [[hypercover]] of $U \in CTop$ degreewise by a [[coproduct]] of contractibles, also the simplicial set $\lim_\to Y$ obtained by sending each contractible to a point is contractible. This follows with [ArtinMazur](#ArtinMazur). See the [proposition beelow](...)

Define then 

$$
  LCTop\infty Grpd := Sh_{(\infty,1)}(CTop)
$$

to be the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves]] on $CTop$. 

This is a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]].

$$
  (\Pi \dashv Disc \dashv \Gamma \dashv coDisc) : LCTop\infty Grpd \to \infty Grpd
  \,.
$$


Proposition. For $X \in LCTop \hookrightarrow LC\infty Grpd$ a [[locally contractible space]] (...maybe with some local size restriction, depending on the details of $CTop$...), regarded as a [[0-truncated]] locally contractible topological $\infty$-groupoid, we have that the [[fundamental ∞-groupoid in a locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos]]-functor applied to $X$ coincides, up to equivalence, with the standard [[fundamental ∞-groupoid]] of $X$.

$$
  \Pi(X) \simeq Sing X
  \,.
$$

Proof. By the analogous arguments as at [[ETop∞Grpd]] we may present $\Pi$ by the left [[derived functor]] of the [[colimit]] functor on [[simplicial presheaves]]. This is the ordinary colimit applied to a cofibrant [[resolution]] of $X$ in $[CTop^{op}, sSet]_{proj,loc}$. By Dugger's cofibrant replacement theorem recalled at [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]], such is given by a [[split hypercover]] $Y \to X$ degreewise a coproduct of objects in $CTop$. By 
[ArtinMazur](#ArtinMazur) there is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]] $\lim_\to Y\to Sing X$.
