## Idea

By the [[dualities in string theory]], 10-dimensional [[type II string theory]] is supposed to be obtained from the [[UV-completion]] of [[11-dimensional supergravity]] by first [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|dimensionally reducing]] over a circle -- to obtain [[type IIA supergravity]] -- and then apply [[T-duality]] along another circle direction to obtain [[type IIB supergravity]].

More precisely, this process relates 11-dimensional supergravity on 11-dimensional [[torus]]-bundles /  [[elliptic fibrations]] to [[type IIA supergravity]]. What is called _F-theory_ is the explicit description of [[type IIB supergravity]] [[vacua]] in terms of such elliptic fibrations.

In this description, the complex modulus $\tau$ of the torus fiber becomes re-interpreted as the _axio-dilaton_, where $Im(\tau) = g$ is the string coupling constant.
