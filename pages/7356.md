## Idea

_F-theory_ is a toolbox for describing [[type IIB string theory]] -- _including_ non-perturbative effects induced from the presence of [[D7-branes]] and [[(p,q)-strings]] -- in terms of [[complex numbers|complex]] [[elliptic fibrations]] whose fiber modulus $\tau$ encodes encodes the [[axio-dilaton]] (the [[coupling constant]] and the degree-0 [[RR-field]]) tranforming under the $SL(2, \mathbb{Z})$ [[S-duality]]/[[U-duality]]. See also at _[[duality in string theory]]_

## Properties

### Relation to (or motivation from) 11d supergravity
 {#From11dSupergravity}

By the [[dualities in string theory]], 10-dimensional [[type II string theory]] is supposed to be obtained from the [[UV-completion]] of [[11-dimensional supergravity]] by first [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|dimensionally reducing]] over a circle $S^1_A$ -- to obtain [[type IIA supergravity]] -- and then applying [[T-duality]] along another circle $S^1_B$ to obtain [[type IIB supergravity]].

To obtain type IIB sugra in noncompact 10 dimensions this way, also $S^1_B$ is to be compactified (since [[T-duality]] sends the radius $r_A$ of $S^1_A$ to the inverse radius $r_B = \ell_s^2 / R_A$ of $S^1_B$).
Therefore type IIB sugra in $d = 10$ is obtained from 11d sugra compactified on the [[torus]] $S^1_A \times S^1_B$. More generally, this torus may be taken to be an [[elliptic curve]] and this may vary over the 9d base space as an [[elliptic fibration]]. 

Applying T-duality to one of the compact direction yields a 10-dimensional theory which may now be thought of as encoded by a 12-dimensional elliptic fibration. This 12d elliptic fibration encoding a 10d type II supergravity [[vacuum]] is the input data that F-theory is concerned with.

A schematic depiction of this story is the following:

|  |  |  |
|--|--|--|
| [[11d supergravity|M-theory]] in $d = 11$ | | F-theory in $d = 12$ |
| $\downarrow$ [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|KK-reduction]] along [[elliptic fibration]] | | $\downarrow$ [[axio-dilaton]] is modulus of [[elliptic fibration]] |
| [[type IIA string theory|IIA string theory]] in $d = 9$ | $\leftarrow$[[T-duality]]$\rightarrow$ | [[type IIB string theory|IIB string theory]] in $d = 10$ |

In the simple case where the elliptic fiber is indeed just $S^1_A \times S^1_B$, the [[imaginary part]] of its complex modulus is

$$
  Im(\tau) = \frac{R_A}{R_B}
  \,.
$$

By following through the above diagram, one finds how this determines the [[coupling constant]] in the [[type II string theory]]:

First, the KK-reduction of M-theory on $S^1_A$ yields a type IIA string coupling

$$
  g_{IIA} = \frac{R_A}{\ell_s}
  \,.
$$

Then the T-duality operation along $S^1_B$ divides this by $R_B$:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    g_{IIB} & = g_{IIA} \frac{\ell_s}{R_B} 
    \\
    & = \frac{R_A}{R_B}
    \\
    & = Im(\tau)
   \end{aligned}
   \,.
$$

### Relation to orientifold type II backgrounds
 {#RelationToOrientifolds}

The general [[vacuum]] of [[type II superstring theory]] (including [[type I superstring theory]]) is an [[orientifold]]. 

The [[target space]] data of an [[orientifold]] is a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-[[principal bundle]]/[[local system]], possibly singular (hence possibly on a [[smooth stack]]). On the other hand, the non-singular part of the [[elliptic fibration]] that defines the F-theory is a $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$-[[local system]] (being the "homological invariant" of the [[elliptic fibration]]). 

An argument due to ([Sen 96](#Sen96), [Sen 97](#Sen97)) says that the F-theory data does induce the [[orientifold]] data along the [[subgroup]] inclusion $\mathbb{Z}_2 \hookrightarrow SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$.

Reasoning like this might suggest that in generalization to how type II [[orientifolds]] involve $\mathbb{Z}_2$-[[equivariant]] [[K-theory]] (namely [[KR-theory]]), so F-theory should involve $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$-equivariant [[elliptic cohomology]]. This was indeed conjectured in ([Kriz-Sati 05, p. 3, p.17, 18](#KrizSati05)). For more on this see at _[[modular equivariant elliptic cohomology]]_.


### Relation to heterotic string theory

The [[duality between F-theory and heterotic string theory]]:

F-theory on an [[elliptic fibration|elliptically fibered]] [[K3]] is supposed to be equivalent to [[heterotic string theory]] [[KK-compactification|compactified]] on a 2-[[torus]]. An early argument for this is due to ([Sen 96](#Sen96)).

More generally, heterotic string theory on an eliptically fibered Calabi-Yau $Z \to B$ of complex dimension $(n-1)$ is supposed to be equivalent $F$-theory on an $n$-dimensional $X\to B$ with elliptic K3-fibers.

A detailed discussion of the [[equivalence]] of the respective [[moduli spaces]] is originally due to ([Friedman-Morgan-Witten 97](#FriedmanMorganWitten97)). A review of this is in ([Donagi 98](#Donagi98)).

### Model building and phenomenology

For F-theory a fairly advanced model building and [[string phenomenology]] has been developed. A detailed review is in ([Denef 08](#Denef08)).
