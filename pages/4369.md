**Lex** is a widely used name for the 2-category of:

* small finitely complete categories, 

* finite limit preserving functors, and 

* natural transformations.

Such categories are also known as **finite limits theories** or [[essentially algebraic theories]].  Finite limit preserving functors are also known as [[left exact functor|left exact functors]] or **lex functors**, and these give Lex its name.
