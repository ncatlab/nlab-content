## Idea

Every [[complex oriented cohomology theory]] induces a [[formal group law]] from its first [[Conner-Floyd Chern class]]. Moreover, [[Quillen's theorem on MU]] together with [[Lazard's theorem]] say that the [[cohomology ring]] $\pi_\bullet(M U)$ of [[complex cobordism cohomology]] [[MU]] is the classifying ring for formal group laws. 

The _Landweber exact functor theorem_ ([Landweber 76](#Landweber76)) says that, conversely, forming the [[tensor product]] of [[complex cobordism cohomology theory]] ([[MU]]) with a [[Landweber exactness|Landweber exact]] [[ring]] via some [[formal group law]] yields a [[cohomology theory]].

By the [[Brown representability theorem]] this defines a [[spectrum]] and the spectra arising this way are called _Landweber exact spectra_. ([e.g. Lurie lect 17, p.2](#Lurie17)).

There is an analogue of the statement also for [[even cohomology theory|even]] 2-[[periodic cohomology theories]], with [[MU]] replaced by [[MP]] ([Lurie lecture 18, prop. 11](#LurieLect18)).


## Statement

By evaluation on $X = B U(1)$, every [[multiplicative cohomology theory|multiplicative]] [[complex oriented cohomology theory]] $E$ gives rise to a [[formal group]] over the [[graded ring]] $\pi_\bullet(E)$.

Conversely, given a formal group $F$ over a [[graded ring]] $R$, one can ask whether this arises from some $E$ in this way. 

Now since the [[Lazard ring]] $L$ classifies formal groups in that $F$ is equivalently given by a [[ring]] [[homomorphism]] $L \longrightarrow R$ and since moreover [[Quillen's theorem on MU]] identifies $L$ with the [[cohomology ring]] of [[complex oriented cohomology theory]] $L \simeq MU_\bullet(\ast)$, one may consider the functor

$$
  X \mapsto E_\bullet(X) \coloneqq MU_\bullet(X) \underset{L}{\otimes} R
  \,.
$$

By construction this is such that $E_\bullet(\ast) \simeq R$. But this functor may fail to satisfy the axioms of a [[generalized homology theory]], hence may fail to be [[Brown representability theorem|Brown represented]] by an actual [[spectrum]] $E$.

Landweber exactness is a sufficient condition on $R$ for $E \coloneqq MU_\bullet(-)\otimes_L R$ to be indeed a [[generalized homology theory]]
(e. g. [Lurie, lect 15, theorem 9](#LurieLecture15)).

Notice that if it is, then the canonical map

$$
  MU_\bullet(X) \otimes_{MU_\bullet} E_\bullet \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow} E_\bullet(X)
$$

is an [[equivalence]]. (For $E = $ [[KU]] this was originally proven in [Conner-Floyd 66](#ConnerFloyd66).) In this form the statement has generalizations beyond [[complex oriented cohomology theory|complex orientation]]. See at _[[cobordism theory determining homology theory]]_.



## Properties of Landweber-exact spectra

### Phantom maps

Between Landweber exact spectra, every [[phantom map]] is already null-homotopic. (e.g. [Lurie lect 17, corollary 7](#Lurie)).
