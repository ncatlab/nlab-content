## Idea

Every [[complex oriented cohomology theory]] induces a [[formal group]]. The _Landweber exact functor theorem_ says that, conversely, forming the [[tensor product]] of [[complex cobordism cohomology theory]] ([[MU]]) with a [[Landweber exactness|Landweber exact]] [[ring]] via some [[formal group law]] yields a [[cohomology theory]].

By the [[Brown representability theorem]] this defines a [[spectrum]] and the spectra arising this way are called _Landweber exact spectra_. ([e.g. Lurie lect 17, p.2](#Lurie17)).

## Statement

By evaluation on $X = B U(1)$, every [[multiplicative cohomology theory|multiplicative]] [[complex oriented cohomology theory]] $E$ gives rise to a [[formal group]] over the [[graded ring]] $\pi_\bullet(E)$.

Conversely, given a formal group $F$ over a [[graded ring]] $R$, one can ask whether this arises from some $E$ in this way. 

Now since the [[Lazard ring]] $L$ classifies formal groups in that $F$ is equivalently given by a [[ring]] [[homomorphism]] $L \longrightarrow R$ and since moreover $L$ is the [[cohomology ring]] of [[complex oriented cohomology theory]] $L \simeq MU_\bullet(\ast)$, one can consider the functor

$$
  X \mapsto E_\bullet(X) \coloneqq MU_\bullet(X) \underset{L}{\otimes} R
  \,.
$$

By construction this is such that $E_\bullet(\ast) \simeq R$. But this functor may fail to satisfy the axioms of a [[generalized homology theory]], hence may fail to be [[Brown representability theorem|Brown represented]] by an actual [[spectrum]] $E$.

Landwever exactness is a sufficient condition on $R$ for $MU_\bullet(-)\otimes_L R$ to be indeed a generalized homology theory

## Properties of Landweber-exact spectra

### Phantom maps

Between Landweber exact spectra, every [[phantom map]] is already null-homotopic. (e.g. [Lurie lect 17, corollary 7](#Lurie)).
