The is a page similar to other "Journal Club" pages where we attempt to understand some concept. In this case it is the category [[M-Set]]. Other Journal Club pages include:

* [[An Exercise in Kantization]]
* [[geometric infinity-function theory|Geometric ∞-Function Theory]]

One paper, in particular, we would like to look at is

>[**The category of M-sets**](http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=13517583)<br>

>**Abstract**<br>
>A topos is a category which looks and behaves very much like the category of sets, and so it may be thought of as a universe for mathematical discourses. One of the very useful topoi in many branches of mathematics as well as in computer sciences is the topos MSet, of sets with an action of a monoid M on them. It is well known that MSet, being isomorphic to the functor category SetM, is a topos. Here, we explicitly give the ingredients of a topos in MSet and investigate their properties for the working scientists and computer scientists. Among other things, we give some equivalent conditions, such as the left Ore condition, to Ω, the subobject classifier of MSet, being a Stone algera. Also the free and the cofree objects, as well as, limits and colimits are discussed in MSet.

Here are some initial questions we hope to better understand:

* What exactly is $M-Set$?
* How is it isomorphic to $Set^M$?
* How does one calculate finite products in $M-Set/Set^M$?

As [[Todd Trimble]] said

>We can go on from there to discuss general limits and colimits in $M-Set$, cartesian closure, the subobject classifier, and so on. This could be fun and a very good learning experience, and there are people right here who know this material rather well.

So let's do it!
