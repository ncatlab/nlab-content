A remarkable consequence of the general fact that [[supergeometry]] is slightly
[[non-commutative geometry|non-commutative]] is that [[super Minkowski spacetimes]],
regarded as the translational part of [[supersymmetry]] [[super Lie algebras]],
carry non-trivial higher [[spin group|spin]]-[[invariant]] [[cocycles]] in super-[[Lie algebra cohomology]].
Generally, invariant $(p+2)$-cocycles on [[cosets]] $X$ induce interesting
[[action functionals]] for $p+1$-dimensional [[sigma-model]] [[field theories]]
with [[target space]] $X$. These encode the [[dynamics]] of _fundamental $p$-[[branes]]_, in a general sense,
that propagate on (or "in") the space(-time) $X$. For $p = 1$ and $X$ the coset of a [[compact Lie group]],
then this is known as the _[[WZW model]]_ describing a [[string]] that propagates on $X$.
Hence generally we may speak of _[[higher WZW models]]_ here.

Accordingly,  each of the exceptional invariant cocycles on [[super Minkowski spacetime]] defines a [[super p-brane]]
[[sigma model]]. These happen to be the _fundamental [[Green-Schwarz superstring]]_ and the _fundamental [[supermembrane]]_
that appear in, or rather that _define_ [[string theory]] and [[M-theory]] ("M-theory" is a "non-committal" shorthand for "membrane theory", [(Hořava-Witten 95, p. 2](#M-theory#NonCommittal)) -- a fact known as the "old [[brane scan]]" ([Achúcarro-Evans-TownsendWiltshire 87](#AETW87)).

Now in higher generalization of how an invariant 2-cocycle on some [[super Minkowski spacetime]] corresponds to a [[central extension|central]]
super-[[Lie algebra extension]] of it to a higher dimensional spacetime, so ever higher cocycle,
i.e. every $p+2$-cocycle for $p \geq 1$, corresponds to a [[super Lie n-algebra|super Lie (p+1)-algebra]] extension
of [[super Minkowski spacetime]], sometimes called an "[[extended super Minkowski spacetime]]".
It turns out that on the [[super Lie n-algebra]] extensions defined by the cocycles for the [[super-string]] and the [[super-membrane]]
make further invariant higher cocycles appear. Interpreting these in turn as [[higher WZW models]] for [[super p-branes]]
it turns out that they correspond to the [[D-branes]] and to the [[M5-brane]] that appear in [[string theory]]/[[M-theory]].
This generalizes the old [[brane scan]] to a tree-like structure of higher invariant extensions that may be called the
_[[schreiber:brane bouquet]]_ of [[string theory]]/[[M-theory]], since it neatly organizes the complete [[super p-brane]] content
purely in terms of [[super Lie n-algebra]] theory ([FSS 13](#FSS13)).

<div style="float:right;margin:0 10px 10px 0;">

</div>

Moreover, it turns out that on [[cocycles]] of [[super Lie n-algebras]] there is a natural [[higher Lie theory|higher Lie theoretic]]
operation of _[[double dimensional reduction]]_: the image in [[rational homotopy theory]] of the [[adjunction unit]]
for the "[[cyclic homology|cyclification]]" [[adjunction]] ([[free loop space]] [[homotopy quotient|homotopy quotiented]] by loop rotation). Applying this to the [[schreiber:brane bouquet]] turns out to yield
relations between the super Lie $n$-algebraic cocycles that embody all the [[dualities in string theory]]
at the level of [[rational homotopy theory]]:
the [[KK-compactification]] from [[M-theory]] to [[type IIA string theory]], the [[T-duality]] of the latter to
[[type IIB string theory]], the [[S-duality]] of the latter, and its relation  to [[F-theory]] ([FSS 16a](#FSS16a), [FSS 16b](#FSS16b)).

Notice that all this concerns _fundamental_ [[super p-branes]] (sometimes referred to as "probe $p$-branes")
-- in generalization of "[[fundamental particles]]" and "fundamental string" --
and in contrast to "solitonic $p$-branes" or "[[black p-branes|black branes]]".
In fact the [[black branes]] (that appear for notably in the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]]) follow from
the fundamental [[super p-branes]]: their [[worldvolumes]] are the [[BPS state]] solutions to the [[supergravity]] [[equations of motion]]
which express but the consistent globalization of the fundamental [[super p-brane]] [[sigma models]]
([Bergshoeff-Sezgin-Townsend 87](#BergshoeffSezginTownsend87)), and moreover their [[worldvolume]] theories
are but the [[perturbation theory]] of the fundamental [[super p-branes]] about these asymptotic singular loci
([Claus-Kallosh-vanProeyen 97](#ClausKalloshProeyen97), [Claus-Kallosh-Kumar-Townsend 98](#ClausKalloshKumarTownsend98)).

Hence a fair bit of the folklore structure of [[string theory]]/[[M-theory]] is (re-)discovered by systematic classification of
the invariant higher extensions of
[[super Minkowski spacetimes]] in [[super Lie n-algebra]] [[homotopy theory]]. But by the
discussion at _[[geometry of physics -- supersymmetry]]_, the relevant [[super-Minkowski spacetimes]]
themselves are themselves already classified as the consecutive ordinary invariant extensions of just the
[[superpoint]] (we review this [below](#SuperMinowskiSpacetimes)).
In conclusion then, a fair bit of the structure of [[string theory]]/[[M-theory]]
is (re-)discovered by a systematic classification of the consecutive invariant higher extension
of the [[superpoint]] in [[super Lie n-algebra]] [[homotopy theory]]. This is what we discuss here.

Computationally, all the these cocycles in the [[schreiber:brane bouquet]] exist
due to special _[[Fierz identities]]_ (which we discuss [below](#FierzIdentities)),
namely due to special spinoral higher [[Clebsch-Gordan coefficients]] that
express the [[tensor product of representations|tensor-product]] operation in the [[real spin representation|real]] [[representation ring]] of the [[spin groups]]
in the given dimensions ([D'Auria-Fré-Maina-Regge 82](#DAuriaFreMainaRegge82), [D'Auria-Fré 82a](#DAuriaFre82a),
[D'Auria-Fré 82b](#DAuriaFre82b))).

Hence there is a tight interplay between spinorial [[representation theory]], [[superalgebra|super-algebraic]] [[higher Lie theory]],
[[spacetime]] that gives rise to a finite system of [[universal exceptionalism|exceptional]] structures: the [[super p-branes]].
This is what we discuss here.

In order to put our discussion in perspective, we start by surveying some

* _[History and background](#HistoryAndBackground)_.

Then in order to lay the basis of all our discussion to follow, which is super [[higher Lie theory]],
we recall [[super Lie algebras]] and discuss their generalization to [[super L-∞ algebras]]
(whose [[formal duals]] are called "[[FDA]]"s in the physics literature):

* _[Super L-infinity cohomology and FDAs](#SuperLInfinityCohomologyAndFDAs)_.

The basic example of [[super Lie algebras]] that induces all phenomena to follow are
the super-translation parts of [[supersymmetry]] algebras, the [[super Minkowski spacetimes]]
introduced in detail in _[[geometry of physics -- supersymmetry]]_. Since here we
frequently need to refer to these structures, we recall their definition again in

* _[Super Minkowski spacetimes](#SuperMinowskiSpacetimes)_.

The key phenomena to be discussed are then the non-trivial invariant [[cocycles]] in the
super-[[Lie algebra cohomology]] of [[super Minkowski spacetimes]] (sometimes called _[[tau cohomology]]_
in the physics literature). Computationally these correspond to certain identities satisfied by
qadrilinear expressions in [[Majorana spinors]]. Such relations are an example of _[[Fierz identities]]_
and so we pause to explain these in

* _[Fierz identities](#FierzIdentities)_.

This then gives rise to the "old [[brane scan]]" of [[Green-Schwarz super-string]] and [[super-membranes]],
which is the classification of the $Spin$-invariant
super-[[Lie algebra cohomology]] of [[super Minkowski spacetimes]] ([[tau cohomology]]):


* _[The super-string and the super-membrane](#TheSuperStringAndTheSuperMembrane)_.

Using our previously established general theory of super-[[L-∞ algebra cohomology]],
we see that the cocycles in the old [[brane scan]] classify
_higher_ central extensions of [[super Minkowski spacetimes]], namely [[super Lie n-algebras]]
called _[[extended super Minkowski spacetimes]]_:

* _[Extended super Minkowski spacetimes](#ExtendedSuperMinkowskiSpacetime)_

A key point then is that these [[super Lie n-algebras]] obtained from [[super Minkowski spacetime]],
turn out to carry _further_ super $L_\infty$-cocycles, not present on the plain
[[super Minkowski spacetimes]]. These correspond to all the [[D-branes]] and to the [[M5-branes]].
This we discuss in

* _[The super D-branes and the M5-brane](#TheSuperDBranes)_

This gives a tree of consecutive higher central [[super Lie n-algebra]] extensions, originating from the [[superpoint]]:
the _[[schreiber:brane bouquet]]_. Next we [[descent|descend]] these iterated central extensions to  single but non-central
higher cocycles. The result turns out to be the image in [[rational homotopy theory]] of the classifying maps of the
[[background fields]] in [[string theory]]/[[M-theory]]: the [[B-field]]-twisted [[RR-fields]] and the M-flux fields.
This we discuss in

* _[Fields](#Fields)_.

There turn out to be special relations among these. In particular passing from  super-[[L-∞ algebra cohomology]]
to the corresponding _[[cyclic cohomology]]_ turns out to be the [[formal dual]] operation of what in
physics is called [[double dimensional reduction]] of [[branes]] (here: of their [[background fields]]). This
crucial operation we discuss in

* _[Double dimensional reduction](#DoubleDimensionalReduction)_ .

By systematically applying this [[super Lie n-algebra|super Lie n-algebraic]] formalization of [[double dimensional reduction]] via [[cyclic cohomology]], we discover all the pertinent [[dualities in string theory]], [[rational homotopy theory|rationally]]:

* _[Dualities](#Dualities)_.







## History and background
 {#HistoryAndBackground}

Below we present fundamental [[super p-branes]] as [[universal exceptionalism|exceptional]]
algebro-geometric structures that are discovered by applying the magnifying glass
(namely a [[Whitehead tower]] construction) of [[super Lie n-algebra]] [[homotopy theory]]
to the atom of [[superspace]]: the [[superpoint]], following ([FSS 13](#FSS13), [FSS 15](#FSS15), [FSS 16a](#FSS16a), [FSS 16b](#FSS16b)).

This is not the perspective from which [[super p-branes]] were arrived at historically. In order
to put our discussion into perspective, here we briefly review some of the historical background.

$\,$

[[perturbation theory|Perturbative]] [[string theory]] on geometric backgrounds is defined by the [[Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond model]], namely by [[sigma-model]] [[2d super conformal field theories]] (of [[central charge]] 15) on [[worldsheets]] $\Sigma$ that are [[super Riemann surfaces]], with [[target spaces]] $X$ that are ordinary (i.e. "bosonic") [[spacetime]] [[manifolds]].

These [[worldsheet]] [[field theories]] are induced from _[[action functionals]]_, namely from variants of the standard [[energy functional]] ([[Polyakov action]]) on the [[mapping space]] $[\Sigma,X]$ of smooth functions

$$
  \phi \;\colon\; \Sigma \longrightarrow X
$$

from the [[worldsheet]] $\Sigma$ to target [[spacetime]] $X$.

The central theorem of perturbative superstring theory
(the no ghost theorem with[[GSO projection]]) says that the excitation spectrum of such a [[2d SCFT]] are the quanta of the [[perturbation theory|perturbations]] of a higher dimensional [[effective field theory|effective]] [[supergravity]] [[field theory]] on target spacetime, hence transforms under [[supersymmetry]] on target spacetime.

This is the fundamental prediction of the assumption of fundamental strings:

1. assuming that the [[fundamental particles]] that run in [[Feynman diagrams]] are fundamentally (at high energy) the ground state modes of a fundamental [[string]],

1. demanding that there are [[fermion|fermionic]] particles among these,

implies

1. that the string must be the [[spinning string]] (have fermions in its [[worldsheet]] theory), which in turn implies...

1. that it is the [[superstring]] (worldsheet [[supersymmetry]] mixes the worldsheet bosons and fermions), precisely: the [[Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond superstring]], which then in addition implies...

1. that its [[target space]] [[effective field theory]] is a [[supergravity]] theory, hence that also the effective target space fields exhibit _local_ [[supersymmetry]] (i.e. "high energy supersymmetry", different from "low energy supersymettry" that the [[LHC]] was looking for).

| main theorem of [[perturbative string theory|perturbative super-string theory]] |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| $ \underset{\text{spinning string}}{\underbrace{\text{fermions} \;+\; \text{strings}}} \;=\; \text{superstring} \;\Rightarrow\; \text{supergravity} $ |

The first step in this implication (identifying the [[spinning string]] as the [[superstring]]) is fairly straightforward
(in fact this is how the concept of [[supersymmetry]] was discovered in "the west", in the first place),
but the second step (that the superstring excitations necessarily are quanta of a [[spacetime]] [[supergravity]] theory)
appears as a miracle from the point of view of the [[Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond superstring]].
It comes out this way by non-trivial computation, but is not manifest in the theory.

In order to improve on this situation, [[Michael Green]] and [[John Schwarz]] searched for and found ([Green-Schwarz 81](#GreenSchwarz81), [Green-Schwarz 82](#GreenSchwarz82) [Green-Schwarz 84](#GreenSchwarz84), for the history see [Schwarz 16, slides 24-25](#Schwarz16)) a suitably equivalent string [[action functional]] that would manifestly exhibit [[spacetime]] [[supersymmetry]].
Acordingly, the this is now called the _[[Green-Schwarz action functional]]_.

| [[action functional]] for [[superstring]] | manifest [[supersymmetry]] |
|----|---|
| [Neveu-Ramond-Schwarz super-string]] | on [[worldsheet]]  |
| Green-Schwarz super-string | on [[target space|target]] [[spacetime]] |

The basic idea is to pass to the evident [[supergeometry|supergeometric]] analogue of the bosonic string action:

Let $\Sigma$ be a [[closed manifold]] of [[dimension]] 2 -- representing the abstract _[[worldsheet]]_ of a string. Let $(X,g)$ be a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]] -- representing a purely [[gravity|gravitational]] [[spacetime]] background. Then the [[action functional]] governing the [[bosonic string]] propagating in this spacetime is the functional

$$
  \exp(\tfrac{i}{\hbar} S_{bos})
  \;\colon\;
  [\Sigma,X]
   \longrightarrow
  \mathbb{R}/_{\hbar}\mathbb{Z}
$$

on the [[smooth space|smooth]] [[mapping space]] $[\Sigma,X]$ (of [[smooth functions]] $\Sigma \to X$), that simply assigns the proper [[relativity|relativistic]] [[volume]] of the image of the [[worldsheet]] $\Sigma$ in [[spacetime]]:

$$
  (\Sigma\overset{\phi}{\longrightarrow} X)
    \;\mapsto\;
  S_{kin}(\phi)
  \coloneqq
  \int_\Sigma vol_{\phi^\ast g}
  \,.
$$

(This is the _[[Nambu-Goto action]]_. It is classically equivalently to the [[Polyakov action]] which is the genuine starting point for the quantum [[Neveu-Ramond-Schwarz super-string]]. Howver, since, as we discuss below, the Green-Schwarz action naturally generalizes to that of other [[p-branes]] it is more natural to consider the Nambu-Goto form of the action here.)

When here $(X,g)$ is generalized to a [[superspacetime]] [[supermanifold]] with [[orthogonal structure]] encoded by a [[super-vielbein]] $e$, then the same form of the action functional still makes sense and produces a functional on the [[supergeometry|supergeometric]] [[mapping space]] $[\Sigma,X]$. Moreover, by construction this action functional now is invariant under the [[superisometry group]] of $(X,g)$, hence under global spacetime [[supersymmetry]].


$$
\array{
  \text{symmetry of worldsheet theory}
  \\
  \array{
    && \Sigma
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{\phi}}\swarrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{\phi'}}
    \\
    X &&\underset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}&& X
  }
  \\
  \text{super-isometry of target spacetime}
}
$$

However, [[Michael Green|Green]] and [[John Schwarz|Schwarz]] noticed that this [[kinetic action]] functional $\phi \mapsto \int_\Sigma vol_{\phi^\ast e}$ does _not_ quite yield dynamics that is equivalent to that of the [[Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond super-string]]: when the [[equations of motion]] hold ("on [[shell]]") it has more fermionic degrees of freedom than present in the [[Neveu-Ramond-Schwarz super-string]]. The key insight of Green and Schwarz was that one may add an extra summand $S_{WZW}$ (whose notation we explain in a moment) to the plain super-[[Nambu-Goto action]] $S_{kin}$, such that the resulting [[action functional]] enjoys a further 1-parameter [[symmetry]], called _[[kappa-symmetry]]_. This is the [[Green-Schwarz action functional]]:

$$
  S_{GS} = S_{kin} + S_{WZW}
  \,.
$$

Moreover, they showed that restricting the
[[dynamics]] of the [[Green-Schwarz superstring]] to the $\kappa$-symmetric states, then it does become equivalent, classically
to that of the [[Neveu-Ramond-Schwarz super-string]].

Finally they showed that when [[gauge fixing]] the [[Green-Schwarz action functional]] to [[light-cone gauge]]
(which is possible whenever [[target spacetime]] admits two [[lightlike]] [[Killing vector]]) then the [[Green-Schwarz string]]
may be [[quantization|quantized]] by a standard procedure and the resulting
[[quantum system|quantum]] dynamics is equivalent to that of the [[Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond super-string]].
This provides the desired conceptual [[proof]] for the observed local [[target spacetime]] [[supersymmetry]]
of super-string [[effective field theory]], at least for backgrounds that admit two lightlike Killing vectors.
(The [[quantization]] of the [[Green-Schwarz superstring]] away from [[light cone gauge]] remains an open problem.)


While Green-Schwarz's extra [[kappa-symmetry]] term $S_{WZW}$ this serves a clear purpose as a means to an end, originally its geometric meaning was mysterious. However, in ([Henneaux-Mezincescu 85](#HenneauxMezincescu85)) it was observed (expanded on in ([Rabin 87](#Rabin87), [Azcarraga-Townsend 89](#AzcarragaTownsend89), [Azcarraga-Izquierdo 95,chapter 8](#AzcarragaIzquierdo95))), that the
[[Green-Schwarz action functional]] describing the [[super-string]] in $d+1$-dimensions does have a neat geometrical interpretation: it is simply the ([[parameterized WZW model|parameterized]]) _[[Wess-Zumino-Witten model]]_ for

1. [[target space]] being locally [[super Minkowski spacetime]] $\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1|\mathbf{N}}$ regarded as the [[coset]] [[supergroup]]

   $$
     \mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert \mathbf{N}}
       \;\simeq\;
     Iso(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert \mathbf{N}}) / Spin(d-1,1)
   $$

   for $\mathbf{N}$ a [[real spin representation]] (the "number of supersymmetries"), $Iso(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert \mathbf{N}})$ the corresponding [[super Poincaré group]] and $Spin(d-1,1)$ its [[Lorentzian manifold|Lorentz-signature]] [[spin group|Spin]] [[subgroup]];

1. [[WZW-term]] being a local potential for the unique (up to rescaling, if it exists) $Spin(d-1,1)$-[[invariant]] [[Lie algebra cohomology|super Lie algebra 3-cocycle]] $\mu_[F1}$ on the [[super Poincaré Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{iso}(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert \mathbf{N}})$, with components locally given by the Gamma-matrices of the given [[Clifford algebra]] representation; in terms of the [[super vielbein]] $(e^a, \psi^\alpha)$:

   $$
     \mu_{F1} = \overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma_A \psi \wedge e_a
   $$

   and so in components the bi-fermionic component of $\mu_{F1}$ is

   $$
     (\mu_{F1})_{a \alpha \beta} = \Gamma_{a \alpha \beta}
   $$

   and all other components vanish.

More in detail, just as ordinary [[Minkowski spacetime]] $\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1}$ may be identified with the [[translation group]]
along itself, with canonical [[linear basis]] of [[left invariant 1-forms]] given by the canonical [[vielbein]] field

$$
  \{e^a \coloneqq \mathbf{d}x^a\}_{a = 0}^{d-1}
  \,,
$$

where $\{x^a\}$ are the canonical [[coordinates]] on $\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1}$, so [[super Minkowski spacetime]] $\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert \mathbf{N}}$ for some [[real spin representation]] $\mathbf{N}$ is characterized as the [[supergroup]] whose [[left invariant 1-forms]] constitute the $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$-bigraded differential with generators the [[super-vielbein]]

$$
  \underset{deg = (1,even)}{\underbrace{e^a}}
    \;\coloneqq\;
  \mathbf{d}x^a + \overline{\theta}\Gamma^a \mathbf{d} \theta
  \;\;\;\,,\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \underset{deg = (1,odd)}{\underbrace{\psi^\alpha}} \;\coloneqq\; \mathbf{d}\theta^\alpha
  \,,
$$

where $(x^a, \theta^\alpha)$ are the canonical coordinates on $\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert \mathbf{N}}$, with the odd-graded elements $\{\theta^\alpha\}$ spanning the given real [[spin representation|Spin(d-1,1)-representation]] $\mathbf{N}$ with [[Clifford algebra]] generators $\{\Gamma^a\}$.

Now while ordinary [[Minkowski spacetime]] $\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1}$ is an [[abelian group]], reflected by the fact that its [[left-invariant 1-forms]] are all closed

$$
  \mathbf{d}e^a = 0 \;\;\;\;\;\; on \; \mathbb{R}^{d-1,1}
  \,,
$$

the key phenomenon of [[supersymmetry]] (that two [[fermions]] pair to a [[bosons]]) means that $\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert \mathbf{N}}$ is slightly non-abelian, reflected by the fact that the [[super-vielbein]] is not closed

$$
  \mathbf{d} e^a =  \overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma^a \psi
  \;\,,\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \mathbf{d} \psi^\alpha = 0
  \,.
$$

This elementary effect is the source of all the rich structure seen in the [[Green-Schwarz super-string]]
and generally in all [[super p-brane]] theory.
(The above differential is equivalently that in the [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] of [[super Minkowski spacetime]],
hence its [[cohomology]] is the super-[[Lie algebra cohomology]] of [[super Minkowski spacetime]]. In parts of the
[[physics]] literature this is referred to a "[[tau cohomology]]".)

In particular, for special combinations of [[spacetime]] [[dimension]] $d$ and number of [[supersymmetries]] $\mathbf{N}$
(i.e. [[real spin representation]] $N$) then the 3-form

$$
  \mu_{F1} =  \overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma_a \psi \wedge e^a
$$

is a non-trivial [[super Lie algebra|super]] [[Lie algebra cocycle]] on $\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert \mathbf{N}}$, in that
$\mathbf{d}\mu_{F1} = 0$ and so that there is no [[left invariant differential form]] $b$ with $\mathbf{d}b = \mu_[F1}$
(beware here the left-invariance condition: there are of course non-left-invariant potentials for $\mu_{F1}$,
and in fact these are exactly the possible [[Lagrangian densities]] for the WZW action functional $S_{WZW}$).

This happens notably for

1. $d = 10$ and $\mathbf{N} = (1,0) = \mathbf{16}$ ([[heterotic string]])

1. $d = 10$ and $\mathbf{N} = (2,0) = \mathbf{16} + \mathbf{16}$ ([[type IIB superstring]])

1. $d = 10$ and $\mathbf{N} = (1,1) = \mathbf{16} + \mathbf{16}^\ast$ ([[type IIA superstring]]).

(It also happens in some lower dimensions, where however the corresponding [[Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond string]] develops a [[conformal anomaly]] after [8quantization]] ("non-critical strings"). This classification of cocycles is part of what has come to be known as the _[[brane scan]]_ in superstring theory, see below.)

In this equivalent formulation, the [[Green-Schwarz action functional]] for the superstring has the following simple form:

Let $(X,e)$ be a [[superspacetime]], hence a [[supermanifold]] $X$ equipped with a [[super-vielbein]] $e$ (super-[[orthogonal structure]]) which is locally modeled on $\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert \mathbf{N}}$ (technically: a [[torsion of a G-structure|torsion]]-free [[super-Cartan geometry]] modeled on $Spin(d-1,1) \hookrightarrow Iso(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert \mathbf{N}})$). Write $\mu_{F1}^X \in \Omega^3(X)$ for the [[super differential form]] on $X$ which is the induced [[definite globalization of WZW term|definite globalization]] of the cocycle $\mu_{F1}$ over $X$. For $U \subset X$ any [[contractible topological space|contractible]] [[subspace]], then the restriction of $\mu^X_{F1}|_{U} \in \Omega^3(U)$ of $\mu_{F1}^X$ to $U$ is exact, and hence admits a potential $B_U \in \Omega^2(U)$, i.e. such that $\mathbf{d} B = \mu^X_{F1}|_U$.

Then for $\Sigma$ a 2-dimensional [[closed manifold]], the [[Green-Schwarz action functional]]

$$
  \exp(\tfrac{i}{\hbar} S_{GS})
  \;\colon\;
  [\Sigma,X]_U
    \longrightarrow
  \mathbb{R}/_{\hbar} \mathbb{Z}
$$

is the function on the super-[[smooth mapping space]] $[\Sigma,X]_U$ of morphisms of [[supermanifolds]] $\phi \colon \Sigma \to X$ which factor through $U$, given by

$$
  \phi
    \;\mapsto\;
  \int_\Sigma vol_{\phi^\ast e}
   \;+\;
  \int_\Sigma \phi^\ast B_U
  \;\;\;\,,\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \mathbf{d} B_U = \mu^X_3|_U
  \,.
$$

In order to get rid of the restriction to some [[chart]] $U \subset X$ one needs to add global data. The need for this is at least mentioned briefly in ([Witten 86, p. 261 (17 of 20)](#Witten86)), but seems to have otherwise been ignored in the physics literature. The general solution is to promote the local potentials $B$ to the connection $\hat B$ on a [[Super Gerbes|super gerbe]] ([FSS 13](#FiorenzaSatiSchreiber13)). This is a choice of [[higher prequantization]]

$$
  \array{

Writing $\int_\Sigma \phi^\ast \hat B$ for the [[volume holonomy]] of a [[circle 2-bundle with connection]] $\hat B$, then the globally defined Green-Schwarz sigma model

$$
  \exp(\tfrac{i}{\hbar} S_{GS})
  \;\colon\;
  [\Sigma, X]
    \longrightarrow
  \mathbb{R}/_\hbar\mathbb{Z}
$$

is given by

$$
  \phi \;\mapsto\; \int_\Sigma vol_{\phi^\ast} + \int_\Sigma \phi^\ast \hat B
  \;\;\,,
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  curv(\hat B) = \mu_{F1}^X
  \,.
$$

This form of the Green-Schwarz action functional for the string has evident generalization to other [[p-branes]]. Whenever there is a [[spin group|Spin(d-1,1)]]-[[invariant]] $(p+2)$-cocycle $\mu_{p+2}$ on $\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert \mathbf{N}}$, then one may ask for a higher gerbe ([[higher prequantum line bundle]]) $\hat C$ with [[curvature]] $\mu^X_{p+2}$ and consider the analogous functional.

The triples $(d,\mathbf{N},p)$ (spacetime dimension, number of supersymmetries, dimension of brane) such that

$$
  \mu_{p+2}
    \;\coloneqq\;
  \overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma^{a_1 \cdots a_p} \psi \wedge e_{a_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge e_{a_p}
$$

is a nontrivial cocycle, hence for which there is such a Green-Schwarz action functional for $p$-branes on $\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert \mathbf{N}}$ may be classified and form what is called the _[[brane scan]]_ ([Achúcarro-Evans-TownsendWiltshire 87](#AETW87), [Brandt 12-13](#Brandt12-13)):

</div>

The graphics on the left is from ([Duff 87](#Duff87)). The diagonal lines indicate [[double dimensional reduction]], taking a $(p+1)$-brane in $(d+1)$ dimensions to a $p$-brane in $d$-dimensions.

For instance for $(d = 11, \; \mathbf{N} = \mathbf{32}, \; p = 2)$ one finds a cocycle, and the corresponding GS-action functional is that of the fundamental [[M2-brane]].

This was a striking confluence of brane physics and classification of [[super Lie algebra|super]] [[Lie algebra cohomology]]. But just as striking as the matching, was what it lacked to match: the [[D-branes]] and the [[M5-brane]] ($d = 11$, $p = 5$) are lacking from the old brane scan. Incidentally, these lacking branes are precisely those branes on which the branes that do appear on the brane scan may end, equivalently those branes that have [[higher gauge fields]] on their [[worldvolume]] (tensor multiplets).

An action functional for the [[M5-brane]] analogous to a Green-Schwarz action functional was found in ([BLNPST 97](#BLNPST97), [APPS 97](#APPS97)). It is again the sum of a kinetic term and a WZW-like term, but the WZW-like term does not come from a cocycle on a (super-)group.

In order to deal with this, it was suggested in ([CAIB 99](#CAIB99), [Sakaguchi 00](#Sakaguchi00), [Azcarraga-Izquierdo 01](#AzcarragaIzquierdo01)) that there is an algebraic structure called "[[extended super-Minkowski spacetimes]]" that generalizes [[super Minkowski spacetime]] and serves to unify the Green-Schwarz-like models for the D-branes and the M5-brane with the original Green-Schwarz models for the string and the M2-brane.

These [[extended super-Minkowski spacetimes]] carry algebraic analogs of super Lie algebra cocycles, such that the relevant terms for the [[D-branes]] and the [[M5-brane]] do appear after all, hence such that all the branes in [[string theory]]/[[M-theory]] are unified. In fact these "[[extended super-Minkowski spacetimes]]" are precisely the "FDA"s that have been introduced before in the [[D'Auria-Fré formulation of supergravity]] and what became identified as the 7-cocycle for the [[M5-brane]] this way had earlier been recognized algebraically as an stepping stone for an elegant re-derivation of [[11-dimensional supergravity]] ([D'Auria-Fré 82](#DAuriaFre82)).

The ([[higher differential geometry|higher]]) geometric meaning of these constructions was found in ([Fiorenza-Sati-Schreiber 13](#FiorezaSatiSchreiber13)): these algebraic structures of "[[extended super-Minkowski spacetimes]]"/FDAs are precisely the [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebras]] of [[super Lie n-algebra]]-extensions of [[super-Minkowski spacetime]] which are classified by the cocycles that serve as the GS-WZW terms of the $p_1$-branes that may end on those $p_2$-branes whose cocycles are carried by the extended super-Minkowski spacetime.

Hence the missing $p$-branes in the old [[brane scan]] (classifying just cocycles on [[super Lie algebras]]) do appear as one generalizes (super) Lie algebras to (super) [[strong homotopy Lie algebras]] = [[L-infinity algebras]]. Moreover, each brane intersection law (one brane species may end on another) is now matched to a super $L_\infty$-algebra [[extension]] and so the old brane scan is generalized to a tree of branes _[[schreiber:The brane bouquet]]_:

<img src="https://ncatlab.org/schreiber/files/BraneBouquetWithDualities.jpg" alt="the brane bouquet" width="900" />

Each item in this bouquet denotes a [[super L-infinity algebra]] and each arrow denotes an [[L-infinity extension]] classified by a cocycle which encodes the GS-WZW term of the brane named by the domain of the arrow. Moreover, arrows pass exactly from one brane species to the brane species that may end on the former.

In ([Fiorenza-Sati-Schreiber 13](#FiorenzaSatiSchreiber13)) it is shown that all these [[super L-infinity algebras]] [[Lie integration|Lie integrate]] to [[smooth super-n-groups]], and all the cocycles [[Lie integration|Lie integrate]] to [[Super Gerbes|super-gerbes]] on these, such that the induced [[volume holonomy]] is the relevant generalized GS-WZW term. For detailed exposition see at _[[schreiber:Structure Theory for Higher WZW Terms]]_.

With this generalized perspective, now the Green-Schwarz-type action functionals describe _all_ the [[p-branes]] in [[string theory]]/[[M-theory]].

Again, in order to make this generally true one needs to apply a [[higher prequantization]] -- a choice of [[line n-bundle with connection|line (p+1)-bundle with connection]] -- in order to globalize the [[WZW-terms]] ([Fiorenza-Sati-Schreiber 13](#FiorenzaSatiSchreiber13))

$$
  \array{
    && \mathbf{B}^{p+1}(\mathbb{R}/_\hbar \mathbb{Z}) & \text{prequantization}
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{\hat A_{p+1}}}\nearrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{curv}}
    \\
    X
     &\underset{\mu^X_{p+2}}{\longrightarrow}&
    \mathbf{\Omega}^{p+2}
    &
    (p+2)\text{-form curvature}
  }
  \,.
$$

Hence $\hat A_{p+1}$ is the actual [[background field]] that the $p$-brane couples to. There is considerably more information in $\hat A_p$ than in its curvature $curv(\hat A_{p+1}) = \mu_{p+2}$. For instance for the [[M2-brane]] one may find the local super [[moduli space]] for local choices of $\hat A_{p+1}$ for the given $\mu_{4}$ on [[KK-compactifications]] to $d = 4$. It turns out that the bosonic [[body]] of this moduli space is the [[exceptional tangent bundle]] on which the [[U-duality]] group [[E7]] has a canonical action (see at _[[schreiber:From higher to exceptional geometry]]_).

This highlights that Green-Schwarz functionals capture fundamental ("microscopic") aspects of $p$-branes. In contrast, often $p$-branes are discussed in their [[soliton|solitonic]] incarnation as _[[black branes]]_. These solitonic branes sit at asymptotic boundaries of [[anti-de Sitter spacetime]] and carry [[conformal field theories]], related to the ambient [[supergravity]] by [[AdS-CFT duality]].

This phenomenon is indeed a consequence of the fundamental Green-Schwarz branes:

Consider a 1/2-[[BPS state]] solution of [[type II supergravity]] or [[11-dimensional supergravity]], respectively. These solutions locally happen to have the same classification as the Green-Schwarz branes. Hence we may consider a configuration $\phi \colon \Sigma \to X$ of the corresponding fundamental $p$-brane which embeds $\Sigma$ into the asymptotic AdS boundary of the given 1/2 BPS spacetime $X$. Then it turns out that restricting the Green-Schwarz action functional to small fluctuations around this configuration, and applying a [[diffeomorphism]] [[gauge fixing]], then the resulting action functional is that of a [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] [[conformal field theory]] on $\Sigma$ as in the [[AdS-CFT]] dictionary:

| fundamental $p$-brane | -fluctuations about asymptotic AdS configuration$\to$ |  solitonic $p$-brane |
|----|-----|---|
| Green-Schwarz action functional |  | [[supersymmetric|super]]-[[conformal field theory]] |

([Claus-Kallosh-Proeyen 97](#ClausKalloshProeyen97), [Claus-Kallosh-Kumar-Townsend 98](#ClausKalloshKumarTownsend98), [AFFFTT 98](#AFFFTT98) [Pasti-Sorokin-Tonin 99](#PastiSorokinTonin99))

In fact the [[BPS-state]] condition itself is neatly encoded in the Green-Schwarz action functionals: by construction they are invariant under the [[spacetime]] [[superisometry group]]. Hence the [[Noether theorem]] implies that there are corresponding [[conserved currents]], whose [[Dickey bracket]] forms a super-[[Lie algebra extension]] of the Lie algebra of supersymmetries.

Here the "$\swArrow$" filling the triangles is the non-trivial gauge transformation by which the [[WZW term]] (as any WZW term) is preserved under the symmetries (instead of being fixed identically). It is the information in this transformations which makes the currents form an extension of the symmetries.

Here this yields the famous brane charge extensions of the super-isometry super Lie algebra of the schematic form

$$
  \{Q_\alpha, Q_\beta\}
  \;=\;
  (C \Gamma^a_{\alpha \beta}) P_a
  \;+\;
  (C \Gamma^{a_1 \cdots a_p})_{\alpha \beta} Z_{a_1, \cdots, a_p}
$$

(for $Q$ a [[Killing spinor]] and $P$ its corresponding [[Killing vector]]) known as the [[type II supersymmetry algebra]] and the [[M-theory supersymmetry algebra]], respectively ([Azcárraga-Gauntlett-Izquierdo-Townsend 89](#AGIT89)). In fact it yields super-[[L-infinity algebra extensions|Lie n-algebra extensions]] of which the familiar super Lie algebra extensions are the 0-truncation ([Sati-Schreiber 15](#SatiSchreiber15), [[schreiber:Local prequantum field theory|Khavkine-Schreiber 16]]).

In summary, the nature and classification of Green-Schwarz action functionals captures in a mathematically precise way a good deal of the core structure of [[string theory|string]]/[[M-theory]].

In fact, the [[super L-infinity algebra|super Lie-n algebraic]] perspective on the Green-Schwarz functionals via the [[schreiber:brane bouquet]] also solves the following open problem on [[M-branes]]:

it is famously known from [[Freed-Witten anomaly]]-cancellation that the [[D-brane charges]] are not in fact just in [[de Rham cohomology]] in every second degree, but are in [[twisted K-theory]], hence [[rational homotopy theory|rationally]] in [[twisted de Rham cohomology]], with the twist being the [[F1-brane]] charge (from the fundamental). It is an open problem to determine what becomes of these [[twisted K-theory]] charge groups as one lifts F1/D$p$-branes in string theory to M2/M5-branes in [[M-theory]].


|   | intersecting branes | charges in [[generalized cohomology theory]]
|-----|--------------|----------------------|
| [[string theory]] | [[F1-brane|F1]]/[[D-brane|Dp-branes]] | [[twisted K-theory]] |
| [[M-theory]]  | [[M2-brane|M2]]/[[M5-branes]] | ??? |

Notice that there are "microscopic degrees of freedom" of the theory encoded by the choice of [[generalized cohomology theory]] here, generalizing the extra degrees of freedom in the choice of a WZW-term already mentioned above. In general for $E$ a cohomology theory and $E \longrightarrow E \otimes \mathbb{Q}$ its [[Chern character]] map (for instance from [[topological K-theory]] to [[ordinary cohomology]] in every second degree), then a choice of genuine charges is the extra information encoded in a lift

$$
  \array{
    && E
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{\text{true charge}}}\nearrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{ch}}
    \\
    X &\underset{\text{rational} \atop  \text{charge}}{\longrightarrow}& E \otimes \mathbb{Q}
  }
$$

But [[rational homotopy theory|rationally]] [[schreiber:The brane bouquet]] allows to derive this from first principles:

Above we saw that the naive cocycles of the [[D-branes]] and of the [[M5-brane]] are not defined on the actual [[spacetime]],  but on some "extended" spacetime, which is really a [[smooth super infinity-groupoid]] extension of spacetime. Hence we should ask if these cocycles [[descent|descend]] to the actual super-spacetime while picking up some twists.

One may prove that:

* the F1/D$p$-brane GS-WZW cocycles descend to 10d type II superspacetime to form a single cocycle in rational twisted K-theory, just as the traditional lore reqires ([Fiorenza-Sati-Schreiber 16](#FiorenzaSatiSchreiber16));

* the M2/M5 GS-WZW cocycles descent to 11d superspacetime to form a single cocycle with values in the [[rational n-sphere|rational 4-sphere]] ([Fiorenza-Sati-Schreiber 16](#FiorenzaSatiSchreiber16)).

This has implications on some open conjectures regarding [[M-theory]], for more on this see _[[schreiber:Equivariant cohomology of M2/M5-branes]]_.

We now explain all this in detail.

**(super graded signature of a permutation)**

Let $V$ be a $\mathbb{Z}$-[[graded object|graded]] [[super vector space]], hence a $\mathbb{Z} \times (\mathbb{Z}/2)$-bigraded vector space.

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ let

For $\sigma$ a [[permutation]] of $n$ elements, write $(-1)^{\vert \sigma \vert}$ for the [[signature of a permutation|signature of the permutation]], which is by definition equal to $(-1)^k$ if $\sigma$ is the composite of $k \in \mathbb{N}$ permutations that each exchange precisely one pair of neighboring elements.

We say that the _super $\mathbf{v}$-graded signature of $\sigma$_

$$

###### Remark

Special cases of the general concept of [[super L-∞ algebras]] def. \ref{sLInfinityDefinitionViaGeneralizedJacobiIdentity} go by special names:

Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a [[super L-∞ algebra]].

If $\mathfrak{g}$ is concentrated in even $\mathbb{Z}/2$-degree, it is called an _[[L-∞ algebra]]_.

If the only possibly non-vanishing brackets of $\mathfrak{g}$ are the unary one $[-]$ (which induces the structure of a [[chain complex]] on $\mathfrak{g}$) and the binary one, then $\mathfrak{g}$ is equivalently a (super-)[[dg-Lie algebra]].

If $\mathfrak{g}$ is concentrated in $\mathbb{Z}$-degrees 0 to $n-1$ then it is called a _[[super Lie n-algebra]]_.

In particular if $\mathfrak{g}$ is concentrated in degree 0, then it is equivalently a [[super Lie algebra]].

Combining this, if $\mathfrak{g}$ is concentrated in even $\mathbb{Z}/2$-degree and in $\mathbb{Z}$-degree 0 through $n-1$, then it is called a _[[Lie n-algebra]]_.

In particular if $\mathfrak{g}$ is concentrated in $\mathbb{Z}$-degree 0 and in even $\mathbb{Z}/2$-degree, then it is

###### Definition

A super $L_\infty$ algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ is of _[[finite type]]_ if the underlying $\mathbb{Z} \times (\mathbb{Z}/2)$-[[graded vector space]] is degreewise of [[finite number|finite]] [[dimension]].

If $\mathfrak{g}$ is of finite type, then its [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] $CE(\mathfrak{g})$ is the [[dg-algebra]] whose underlying [[graded algebra]] is the super-Grassmann algebra

$$
  \wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^{\ast}
$$

of the graded degreewise [[dual vector space]] $\mathfrak{g}^\ast$, equipped with the [[differential]] which on generators is the sum of the [[dual linear maps]] of the $n$-ary brackets:

$$
  d_{\mathfrak{g}}
   \coloneqq
  [-]^\ast + [-,-]^\ast + [-,-,-]^\ast + \cdots
  \;\colon\;
  \wedge^1 \mathfrak{g}^\ast
    \longrightarrow
  \wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^\ast
$$

and extended to all of $\wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^\ast$ as a super-graded [[derivation]] of degree $(1,even)$.

Notice that here the [[signs in supergeometry]] are such that for $\alpha_i \in \mathfrak{g}^\ast_{(n_i,s_i)}$ elements of homogenous bidegree, then

$$
  \alpha_1 \wedge \alpha_2
  \;=\;
  -(-1)^{n_1 n_2} (-)^{s_1 s_2}
$$

and

$$
  d_{\mathfrak{g}}
  (\alpha_1 \wedge \alpha_2)
  \;=\;
  (d_{\mathfrak{g}} \alpha_1) \wedge \alpha_2
  +
  (-1)^{n_1} \alpha_1 \wedge (d_{\mathfrak{g}} \alpha_2)
  \,.
$$

(see at _[[signs in supergeometry]]_ for more on this).

A _strong homotopy homomorphism_ ("sh-map") between super $L_\infty$-algbras of [[finite type]]

$$
 f \;\colon\; \mathfrak{g}_1 \longrightarrow \mathfrak{g}_2
$$

is defined to be a homomorphism of [[dg-algebras]] between their [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebras]] going the other way:


$$
  CE(\mathfrak{g}_1) \longleftarrow CE(\mathfrak{g}_2)
    \;\colon\;
  f^\ast
$$

(here $f^\ast$ is the primitive concept, and $f$ is defined as the [[formal dual]] of $f$). Hence the [[category]] of super $L_\infty$-algebras of [[finite type]] is the [[full subcategory]]

$$
  s L_\infty Alg \hookrightarrow dgAlg^{op}
$$

of the [[opposite category]] of [[dg-algebras]] on those that are CE-algebras as above.

Finally, the [[cochain cohomology]] of the [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] $CE(\mathfrak{g})$ of a super $L_\infty$ algebra of [[finite type]] is its _[[L-∞ algebra cohomology]]_ with [[coefficients]] in $\mathbb{R}$:

$$

  H^\bullet(CE(\mathfrak{g}))

###### Remark
**(history of the concept of (super-)$L_\infty$ algebras)**

The identification of the concept of (super-)$L_\infty$-algebras has a non-linear history:

[[L-∞ algebras]] in the incarnation of higher brackets satisfying a higher Jacobi identity,
def. \ref{sLInfinityDefinitionViaGeneralizedJacobiIdentity}
and remark \ref{LInfinityTerminology}, were introduced in
[Lada-Stasheff 92](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/L-infinity-algebra#LadaStasheff92), based on the
example of such a structure on the [[BRST complex]] of the [[bosonic string]] that
was found in the construction of [[closed string field theory]] in [Zwiebach 92](string+field+theory#Zwiebach93).
Some of this history is recalled in [Stasheff 16](#L-infinity-algebra#Stasheff16).

The observation that these systems of higher brackets are fully characterized by their Chevalley-Eilenberg dg-(co-)algebras
(def. \ref{SuperLInfinityCEAlgebra})
is due to [Lada-Markl 94](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/L-infinity-algebra#LadaMarkl94).
See [Sati-Schreiber-Stasheff 08, around def. 13](#SatiSchreiberStasheff08).

But in this dual incarnation, [[L-∞ algebras]] and more generally [[super L-∞ algebras]] (of [[finite type]])
had secretly been introduced within the [[supergravity]] literature already in [D'Auria-Fré-Regge 80](#DAuriaFreRegge80) and explicitly in [van Nieuwenhuizen 82](#Nieuwenhuizen82).
The concept was picked up in the [[D'Auria-Fré formulation of supergravity]] ([D'Auria-Fré 82](#DAuriaFre82)) and eventually came to be referred to as "FDA"s (short for "free differential algebra") in the [[supergravity]] literature (but beware that these dg-algebras
are in general [[free construction|free]] only as graded-[[supercommutative superalgebras]], not as differential algebras)
The relation between super $L_\infty$-algebras and the "FDA"s of the [[supergravity]] literature is made explicit in ([FSS 13](#FSS13)).

| [[higher Lie theory]] | [[supergravity]] |
|----------------------------|-----------------------|
| $\,$ [[super Lie n-algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ $\,$ | $\,$ "FDA" $CE(\mathfrak{g})$ $\,$ |

The construction in [van Nieuwenhuizen 82](#Nieuwenhuizen82) in turn was motivated by the [[Sullivan algebras]]
in [[rational homotopy theory]] ([Sullivan 77](#rational+homotopy+theory#Sullivan77)). Indeed, their
dual incarnations in rational homotopy theory are [[dg-Lie algebras]] ([Quillen 69](#rational+homotopy+theory#Quillen69)),
hence a special case of $L_\infty$-algebras (remark \ref{LInfinityTerminology})

This close relation between [[rational homotopy theory]] and [[higher Lie theory]] might have remained less of a
secret had it not been for the focus of [[Sullivan minimal models]] on the non-[[simply connected topological space|simply connected]]
case, which excludes the ordinary [[Lie algebras]] from the picture. But the Quillen model of
[[rational homotopy theory]] effectively says that for $X$ a [[rational topological space]] then its [[loop space]]
[[∞-group]] $\Omega X$ is reflected, infinitesimally, by an [[L-∞ algebra]]. This perspective began to
receive more attention when the [[Sullivan construction]] in [[rational homotopy theory]] was
concretely identified as higher [[Lie integration]] in [Henriques 08](#Lie+integration#Henriques).
A modern review that makes this [[L-∞ algebra]]-theoretic nature of [[rational homotopy theory]] manifest is in
[Buijs-Félix-Murillo 12, section 2](rational+homotopy+theory#BuijsFelixMurillo12).

=--




However, what has not been used in the "FDA" literature is that super $L_\infty$-algebras are objects in _[[homotopy theory]]_:


+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition
**([Pridham 10, prop. 4.36](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/model+structure+for+L-infinity+algebras#Pridham))**

There exists a [[model category]] such that

1. its [[fibrant objects]] are the (super-)[[L-∞ algebras]]

   with the above [[homomorphisms]] between them;

1. and

   * the weak equivalences between (super-)$L_\infty$-algebras are the [[quasi-isomorphisms]];

   * fibrations between (super-)$L_\infty$-algebras are the surjections

   on the underlying [[chain complex]] (using the unary part of the differential).

For more see at _[[model structure for L-infinity algebras]]_.

=--

$\,$

Concretely, this implies in particular that every [[homomorphisms]] of [[super L-∞ algebras]]

$$
  \array{
    \mathfrak{g}_1
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{f}}\searrow
    \\

$$

is the composite of a [[quasi-isomorphism]] followed by a surjection

$$
  \array{
    \mathfrak{g}_1
     && \overset{\text{quasi-iso}}{\longrightarrow} &&
    \widetilde \mathfrak{g}_1

    \\
    && \mathfrak{g}_2

That surjective homomorphism $f_{fib}$

is called a _[[fibrant replacement]]_ of $f$.

###### Definition

Given [[homomorphisms]] of [[super L-∞ algebras]]

$$
  \mathfrak{g}_1 \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} \mathfrak{g}_2
$$

then its **[[homotopy fiber]]** $hofib(f)$ is the [[kernel]] of any fibrant replacement

$$
  hofib(f)
   \;\coloneqq\;
  ker(f_{fib})
  \,.
$$

Standard facts in [[homotopy theory]] assert that $hofib(f)$ is well-defined up to [[quasi-isomorphism]].
See at _[Introduction to homotopy theory -- Homotopy fibers](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#HomotopyFibers)_.

The following is the ky fact about homotopy fibers in the homotopy theory of super $L_\infty$-algebras
which we will use:

$$
  b^{p+1}\mathbb{R}
$$

for the **[[line Lie n-algebra|line Lie (p+1)-algebra]]**, given by

$$
  CE(b^{p+1}\mathbb{R})

    \;,\;
    d_{B^{p+1}\mathbb{R}} = 0

A $(p+2)$-cocycle on an $L_\infty$-algebra is equivalently a homomorphim

$$

As a slogan: _The higher central extensions classified by higher cocycles are their homotopy fibers._


+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

The homotopy fiber of a 2-cocycle on a [[super Lie algebra]] is the classical [[central extension]] that it classifies:

Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a super Lie algebra of finite dimension, and let $\omega_2 \in \wedge^2 \mathfrak{g}^\ast$
be a 2-cocycle $d_{\mathfrak{g}} \omega_2 = 0$. Then prop. \ref{HomotopyFibersOfLInfinityCocycles} says
that the homotopy fiber $\widehat{\mathfrak{g}} \longrightarrow \mathfrak{g}$
of the corresponding morphism $\mathfrak{g} \overset{\omega_2}{\longrightarrow} b \mathbb{R}$
has [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] that of $\mathfrak{g}$ with one new generator $c \in \wedge^1 (\widehat {\mathfrak{g}})$
adjoined, with differential given by

$$
  d_{\mathfrak{g}} c = \omega_2
  \,.
$$

Now by def. \ref{CEAlgebraofSuperLieAlgebra} this differential enocodes the linear dual of the
Lie bracket. Hence if $k$ denotes the dual element of $c$ then the Lie brakcet of $\widehat{\mathfrak{g}}$
is modified on elements of $\mathfrak{g}$ to be

$$
  [x,y]_{\widehat{\mathfrak{g}}} = [x,y]_{\mathfrak{g}}+ \omega_2(x,y) k
  \,.
$$

This is exactly the ordinary formula for the central extension of $\mathfrak{g}$ by $\omega_2$.

## Super Minkowski spacetimes
 {#SuperMinowskiSpacetimes}


In order set the scene, and for reference, we recall the nature of [[super Minkowski spacetimes]] from _[[geometry of physics -- supersymmetry]]_.

In all of the following it is most convenient to regard [[super Lie algebras]] dually
via their [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebras]] ("[[FDA]]"s), via def. \ref{CEAlgebraofSuperLieAlgebra} and prop. \ref{FormalDualCE}:




+-- {: .num_defn #SuperMinkowskiSpacetime}
###### Definition

Let

$$
  d \in \mathbb{N}
$$

be a [[spacetime]] [[dimension]] and let

$$
  N \in Rep_{\mathbb{R}}(Spin(d-1,1))
$$

be a [[real spin representation]] of the [[spin group]] cover $Spin(d-1,1)$ of the [[Lorentz group]] $O(d-1,1)$
in this dimension. Then the _$d$-dimensional $N$-supersymmetric [[super-Minkowski spacetime]]_ $\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1|N}$
is the [[super Lie algebra]] that is characterized by the fact that its [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]]
$CE(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1})$ (def. \ref{CEAlgebraofSuperLieAlgebra}) is as follows:

The algebra has generators (as an [[associative algebra]] over $\mathbb{R}$)

$$
   \underset{deg = (1,even)}{\underbrace{e^a}}
   \;\;\;\;
   \text{and}
   \;\;\;\;
   \underset{deg = (1,odd)}{\underbrace{\psi^\alpha}}
$$

for $a \in \{0,1,2, \cdots, 9\}$ and $\alpha \in \{1, 2, \cdots dim_{\mathbb{R}}(N)\}$ subjects to the [[generators and relations|relations]]

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    e^a \wedge e^b = - e^b \wedge e^a
    \\
    \psi^\alpha \wedge \psi^\beta = + \psi^\beta \wedge \psi^\alpha
    \\
    e^a \wedge \psi^\alpha = - \psi^\alpha \wedge e^a
  \end{aligned}
$$

(see at _[[signs in supergeometry]]_), and the [[differential]] $d_{CE}$ acts on the generators as follows:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    d_{\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert N}} \; \psi^\alpha &
      \coloneqq
      0
    \\
    d_{\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert N}} \; e^a
      & \coloneqq \overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma^a \psi
    \\
    & \coloneqq   \left(C_{\alpha \alpha'} {\Gamma^a}^{\alpha'}{}_\beta\right)  \psi^\alpha \wedge \psi^\beta
  \end{aligned}
    \,,
$$

where

1. $\overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma^a \psi$ denotes the $a$-component of the $Spin(d-1,1)$-invariant spinor bilinear pairing $N \otime N \to \mathbb{R}^d$ that comes with every [[real spin representation]] applied to $\psi \wedge \psi$ regarded as an $N \otimes N$-valued form;

1. hence in components (if $N$ is a [[Majorana spinor]] representation, by [this prop.](geometry+of+physics+--+supersymmetry#SpinorToVectorBilinearPairing)):

   1. $C = (C_{\alpha \alpha'})$ is the [[charge conjugation matrix]] (as discussed at _[[Majorana spinor]]_);

   1. $\Gamma^a = ((\Gamma^a)^{\alpha}{}_\beta)$ are the [[matrices]] representing the [[Clifford algebra]] action on $N$ in the [[linear basis]] $\{\psi^\alpha\}_{\alpha = 1}^{dim_{\mathbb{R}}(N)}$

1. [[Einstein summation convention|summation over paired indices]] is understood.

That this indeed yields a [[super Lie algebra]] follows by the symmetry and equivariance of the bilinear spinor pairing (via [this prop.](geometry+of+physics+--+supersymmetry#SpinorToVectorPairing)).

There is a canonical [[Lie algebra action]] of the [[special orthogonal Lie algebra]]

$$
  Lie(Spin(d-1,1)) \simeq \mathfrak{so}(d-1,1)
$$

on $\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert 1}$. The _$N$-supersymmetric [[super Poincaré Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{iso}(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert N})$ in dimension $d$_ is the [[super Lie algebra]] which is the [[semidirect product Lie algebra]] of this [[Lie algebra action]]

$$
  \mathfrak{iso}(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert N})
   =
  \mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert N} \rtimes \mathfrak{so}(d-1,1)
  \,.
$$

This is characterized by the fact that its [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] $CE(\mathfrak{iso}(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert N}))$
is as follows:

it is [[generators and relations|generated]] from elements

$$
   \underset{deg = (1,even)}{\underbrace{e^a}}
   \;\;\;\;
   and
   \;\;\;\;
   \underset{deg = (1,odd)}{\underbrace{\psi^\alpha}}
   \;\;\;\;
   and
   \;\;\;\;
   \underset{deg = (1,even)}{\underbrace{\omega^{a b} = - \omega^{b a}}}
$$

with the [[super vielbein]] $(e^a, \psi^\alpha)$ as before, and with $\omega^{a b}$ the
[[dual basis]] of the induced [[linear basis]] for vectro space of skew-symmetric matricces
underlying the [[special orthogonal Lie algebra]]. The commutation relations are as before,
together with the relation that the generators $\omega^{a b}$ anti-commute with every generator.
Finally the [[differential]] $d_{\mathfrak{iso}(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert N})}$ acts on
these generators as follows:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    d_{\mathfrak{iso}(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert N})} \; \psi^\alpha
      & \coloneqq
      \left(\tfrac{1}{4}\omega^{a b} \Gamma_{a b} \psi \right)^\alpha
      \\
      & \coloneqq
      \left(\tfrac{1}{4} (\Gamma_{a b})^\alpha{}_{\beta} \right) \omega^{a b} \wedge \psi^\beta
    \\
    d_{\mathfrak{iso}(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert N})} \; e^a
      & \coloneqq \overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma^a \psi - \omega^a{}_b \wedge e^b
    \\
    & \coloneqq
       \left(
           C_{\alpha \alpha'} {\Gamma^a}^{\alpha'}{}_\beta
       \right)
       \psi^\alpha \wedge \psi^\beta - \omega^a{}_b \wedge e^b
    \\
  \end{aligned}
    \,,
$$


where we are shifting spacetime indicices with the Lorentz metric

$$
  (\eta_{a b}) \coloneqq diag(-1,1,1,\cdots, 1)
  \,.
$$

The canonical maps between these [[super Lie algebras]], dually between their [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebras]], that send each generator to itself, if present, or to zero if not, constitute the [[diagram]]

$$
  \array{
    \mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert N}

###### Remark

If we think of [[super Minkowski spacetime]] $\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert N}$  as the [[supermanifold]] with

* even [[coordinates]] $\{x^a\}_{a = 0}^{d-1}$;

* odd [[coordinates]] $\{\theta_\alpha\}_{\alpha = 1}^{dim_{\mathbb{R}}(N) }$

then the algebra generators $e^a$ and $\psi^\alpha$ in def. \ref{SuperMinkowskiSpacetime}  correspond to these [[super differential forms]]:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    e^a & = d_{dR} x^a + \underset{\text{correction term}}{\underbrace{\overline{\theta} \Gamma^a d_{dR} \theta}}

Notice that $d_{dR} x^a$ alone fails to be a left [[invariant differential form]], in that it is not annihilated by the [[supersymmetry]] vector fields

$$
  D_\alpha
    \;\coloneqq\;
  \partial_{\theta^\alpha} - \overline{\theta}_{\alpha'} \Gamma^a{}^{\alpha'}{}_\alpha \partial_{x^a}\,.

###### Remark

By def. \ref{SuperLieAlgebraCohomology} the super-[[Lie algebra cohomology]]
of [[super Minkowski spacetimes]] (def. \ref{SuperMinkowskiSpacetime}) is the cohomology of the [[differential]]

$$
  d_{CE} \, e^a = \overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma^a \psi
  \;\;\;\,,\;\;\;
  d_{CE} \, \psi^\alpha = 0
  \,.
$$

(also called "[[tau-cohomology]]").

This may superficially look fairly trivial, but in fact it turns out to me very rich.
Specifically we are interested in the $Spin(d-1,1)$-[[invariant]] cohomology. A $Spin$-[[invariant]]
[[cochain]] in the [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] $CE(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert M})$ is easily seen to
be equivalently a sum of wedge products of the above generators, such that all indices are
contracted with $\Gamma$-matrices. Hence these are the monomials of the form

$$
  \mu_{p+2}
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \overline{\psi} \Gamma_{a_1 \cdots a_p} \psi
  \,.
$$

We immediately find that the differential takes these to the following expressions (using the fact that the differential is a graded [[derivation]]):


$$
  d_{CE} \mu_{p+2}
    \;=\;
  p
  \;
  \left(
    \overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma_{a_1 \cdots a_{p-1} b} \psi
  \right)
  \wedge
  \left(
    \overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma^b \psi
  \right)
  \wedge
  e^{a_1}\wedge \cdots \wedge e^{p_{p-1}}
  \,.
$$

For the these expressions to vanish, all their components have to vanish, hence all the following [[multilinear map|quadrilinear]]
expressions in the [[spinors]] have to vanish identicaly:

$$
  d_{CE} \mu_{p+2} = 0
  \;\;\;\; \Leftrightarrow
  \;\;\;\;
  \left(
    \overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma_{a_1 \cdots a_{p-1} b} \psi
  \right)
  \wedge
  \left(

Such relation among spinors are known as [[Fierz identities]]. These we discuss now in
_[Fierz identities](#FierzIdentities)_.






## Fierz identities
 {#FierzIdentities}


What are called _[[Fierz identities]]_ in [[physics]] are the relations that hold between [[multilinear map|multilinear]]  expression in [[spinors]]. For example for all [[Majorana spinors]] $\psi$ in Lorentian spacetime dimension 4,5,7, 11, then the following identity holds (example \ref{TheM2andM5CocyclesAsFierzIdentities} below):

$$
  \left(\overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma_{a b} \psi\right)
  \wedge
  \left(\overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma^b \psi\right)

  \;=\;
  0
  \,.
$$

(Here $\overline{(-)}$ denotes the Majorana conjugate, $\Gamma_a$ are a Clifford representations, the "$\wedge$"-signs denotes symmetrization in the spinor components and summation over repeated indices is understood. The details of this are discussed [below](#BilinearFierzIdentities).)

In [D'Auria-Fré-Maina-Regge 82](#DAuriaFreMainaRegge82) it was pointed out that all Fierz identities may be understood as expressing the product operation in the [[representation ring]] of the [[spin group]] (in some given dimension): for $\{S_i\}_{i \in I}$ denoting [[isomorphism classes]] of [[irreducible representations|irreducible]] [[spin representations]], then, by definition of [[irreps]], their [[tensor product of representations]] decomposes again as a [[direct sum]] of [[irreducible representations]]

$$
  S_i \otimes S_j  = \underset{k}{\oplus} C_{i j}{}^k S_k
$$

with "[[Clebsch-Gordan coefficients]]" $C_{i j}{}^k$. These coefficients are effectively the Fierz identities.

For example for Lorentzian dimension 11 with $(\tfrac{1}{2})^5$ denoting the unique irreducible [[Majorana spinor]] representation, then one finds ([D'Auria-Fré 82b, section 3](#DAuriaFre82b)) that the symmetric part in the quadruple tensor product of this representation with itself decomposes as a direct sum of irreps as follows

$$
  \left\{
    (\tfrac{1}{2})^5
      \otimes
    (\tfrac{1}{2})^5
      \otimes
    (\tfrac{1}{2})^5
      \otimes
    (\tfrac{1}{2})^5
  \right\}_{sym}
   \;\simeq\;
  (0)^5
    \;\oplus\;
  (1)^3 (0)^2
    \;\oplus\;
  (1)^4 (0)
    \;\oplus\;
  (1)^5
    \;\oplus\;
  (2) (0)^4
    \;\oplus\;
  (2)(1)(0)^3
    \;\oplus\;
  (2)^2 (0)^3
    \;\oplus\;
  (2)^2 (1)^3
    \;\oplus\;
  (2)^5
$$

where the symbols refer to [[Young diagrams]] canonically labeling representations (details are in example \ref{11dQuadrilinearCGCoefficients} below).

The point is that the expression $ \left(\overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma_{a b} \psi\right) \wedge \left(\overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma^b \psi\right)$ from above is a spinor quadrilinear which transforms in the vector representation $(1)(0)^4$ (due to its one free spacetime index). But that vector representation $(1)(0)^4$ is missing from the [[direct sum]] above, meaning that the spinor quadrilinear has vanishing components in this vector representation, hence that this expression vanishes identically.

We discuss Fierz identities as identities among multispinorial elements of the [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] $CE(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert N})$ of [[super-Minkowski spacetime]] $\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert N}$, regarded as the super-translation [[supersymmetry]] [[super Lie algebra]]. In this form Fierz identities encode [[cocycles]] in the [[supersymmetry]] super-[[Lie algebra cohomology]], such as those which serve as [[higher WZW terms]] characterizing [[super p-branes]]. We follow [Castellani-D'Auria-Fré 82, section II.8](#CDF).


### Bilinear Fierz identities
  {#BilinearFierzIdentities}

Given a fixed [[real spin representation]] $N$, then the
odd [[coordinates]] $\{\theta^\alpha\}_{\alpha = 1}^{dim_{\mathbb{R}}(N) }$ of the [[super Minkowski spacetime]] [[supermanifold]]
$\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert N}$ span, by construction, precisely that representation space, and hence so do the
spinorial components of the [[super vielbein]] form

$$
  \psi^\alpha = \mathbf{d}\theta^\alpha
   \;\;\;
   \in \Omega^{\bullet}_{li}(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert N})
   \simeq
    CE(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert N})
  \,,
$$

since in the construction of [[super differential forms]] on $\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert N}$, the de Rham operator
$\mathbf{d}$ acts on the odd coordinates just formally, by sending the generator $\theta^\alpha$ to the new generator
named $\mathbf{d} \theta^\alpha$.

Therefore we may identify the [[spin representation]] $N$ with the [[linear span]] (over $\mathbb{R}$) of these elements

$$
  N  \simeq \langle \mathbf{d}\theta^\alpha \rangle_{\alpha = 1}^{dim_{\mathbb{R}}(N) }
  \,,
$$

were the [[spin group]] acts on the elements on the right in the defining way (see at _[[geometry of physics -- supersymmetry]]_): a spinorial rotation in a plane $\omega = \{\omega^{a b}\}$ by an angle $\alpha$ acts by

$$
  R_\omega(\psi) \coloneqq \exp(\tfrac{\alpha}{4} \omega^{a b} \Gamma_{a b} ) \psi
  \,.
$$

We may build new [[spin representations]] from this one by forming multilinear expressions in the [[super vielbein]]. For example the elements in $CE(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert N})$ of the form

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma_a \psi
    &=
    \left(C_{\alpha \alpha'} \Gamma_a{}^{\alpha'}_{\beta}\right) \, \psi^\alpha \wedge \psi^{\beta}
    \\
    & =
    \left(C_{\alpha \alpha'} \Gamma_a{}^{\alpha'}_{\beta}\right) \, \mathbf{d}\theta^\alpha \wedge \mathbf{d}\theta^\beta
  \end{aligned}
$$

span, as the spacetime index $a$ ranges in $\{0, 1, \cdots, d-1\}$, a $d$-dimensional [[real vector space]]

$$
  \left\langle
     \,\overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma_a \psi\,
  \right\rangle_{a = 0}^{d-1}
$$

which still carries a linear [[action]] of the [[spin group]], induced from the spin action on the $\psi$-s:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    R_\omega(\overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma_a \psi)
    & =
    \overline{\left( \exp(\tfrac{\alpha}{4}\omega^{a b}\Gamma_{a b} ) \psi \right)}
      \wedge \Gamma_a
    \left( \exp(\tfrac{\alpha}{4}\omega^{a b}\Gamma_{a b} \psi ) \right)
    \\
    & =
    \overline{\psi} \wedge \exp(-\tfrac{\alpha}{4} \omega^{a b} \Gamma_{a b}) \Gamma_a \exp(\tfrac{\alpha}{2}\omega^{a b} \Gamma_{a b})
     \psi
    \\
    & =
    \overline{\psi}
      \wedge
      (R_\omega(\Gamma_a))
    \psi
    \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

Of course similarly we obtain elements

$$
  \overline{\psi} \Gamma_{a_1 \cdots a_p} \psi
$$

which, if they are non-vanishing at all, span the representation

$$
  \wedge^p \mathbb{R}^d
$$

Now observe that we may say all this more abstractly as follows:

1. the elements $(\psi \wedge \overline{\psi})^{\alpha \beta}$ span the symmetrized [[tensor product of representations]]

   $$
     \{N \otimes N\}_{sym}
       \;\simeq\;
     \langle
       \,  (\psi \wedge \overline{\psi})^\alpha{}_\beta \,
     \rangle_{\alpha,\beta = 1}^{dim_{\mathbb{R}}(N)}
   $$

1. for given $p \in \mathbb{N}$, then the elements of the form $\overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma_{a_1 \cdots a_p} \psi$ form a [[subrepresentation]] thereof, equivalent to the vector representation $\wedge^p\mathbb{R}^{d}$

1. hence there is a [[direct sum]] decomposition

   $$
     \left\{N \otimes N\right\}_{sym}
       \;\simeq\;
      \underset{p \in \mathbb{N}}{\bigoplus}
      c_p \left(\wedge^p \mathbb{R}^d\right)
   $$

   in the [[category of representations]] of the [[spin group]], which expresses the (symmetrized) [[tensor product of representations]] of the [[Majorana spinor]] representation as a [[direct sum]] of skew-symmetrized tensor products of the vector representation.

Indeed this direct sum decomposition is exhaustive:

+-- {: .num_prop #BilinearFierzDecomposition}
###### Proposition

For $d \in \mathbb{N}$ and $N$ a [[Majorana spinor]] representation of $Spin(d-1,1)$, then the following identity holds:

$$
  (\psi \wedge \overline{\psi})^\alpha{}_\beta
   \;=\;
  \tfrac{1}{dim_{\mathbb{R}}(N)}
  \left(
     \left(
       \overline{\psi}\psi
     \right)
     +
     \left(
       \overline{\psi} \Gamma_a \psi
     \right)
     (\Gamma^a)^\alpha{}_\beta
     +
     \tfrac{1}{2!}
     \left(
       \overline{\psi} \Gamma_{a_1 a_2} \psi
     \right)
     (\Gamma^{a_1 a_2})^\alpha{}_\beta
      +
     \cdots
  \right)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the discussion there, the [[Majorana spinor]] representation is a real sub-representation of a complex _Dirac representation_ $\mathbb{C}^{(2^\nu)}$. The latter has the special property that

1. the [[Clifford algebra]] contains the full [[matrix algebra]];

1. for $p \geq 1$ the Clifford elements $\Gamma_{a_1 \cdots a_p}$ have vanishing [[trace]].

The first point implies that there exists coefficients $X^{a_1 \cdots a_p} \in \mathbb{C}$ for $p \in \mathbb{N}$ such that

$$
  \psi \wedge \overline{\psi}
    =
  \tfrac{1}{dim_{\mathbb{R}}(N)}
  \left(
    X
    +
    X^a \Gamma_a
    +
    X^{a b} \Gamma_{a b}
    +
    \cdots
  \right)
  \,.
$$

The second condition then implies that multiplying this expression with $\Gamma^{a_1 \cdots a_p}$ and taking the trace projects out the coefficient $X^{a_1 \cdots a_p}$:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    X^{a_1 \cdots a_p}
      & =
    \frac{1}{p! dim_{\mathbb{R}}(N)}
    tr_N
    \left(
      \left(
        X
        +
        X^a \Gamma_a
        +
        X^{a b} \Gamma_{a b}
        +
        \cdots
      \right)
      \Gamma^{a_1 \cdots a_p}
   \right)
   \\
   & =
   \tfrac{1}{p!}
   tr_N
   \left(
     \psi \wedge \overline{\psi} \, \Gamma^{a_1 \cdots a_p}
   \right)
   \\
   & =
   \tfrac{1}{p!}
   \left(
     \overline \psi \wedge \Gamma^{a_1 \cdots a_p} \psi
   \right)
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

Notice that it is the last step, identifying the trace over $\psi \wedge \overline{\psi} \Gamma^{a_1 \cdots a_p}$ with the $\psi$-$\psi$ component of the matrix $\Gamma^{a_1 \cdots a_p}$, where we use the _symmetrization_ of the spinor tensor product, namely the identity $\psi^\alpha \wedge \overline{\psi}_\beta = \overline{\psi}_\beta \wedge \psi^\alpha$.

=--


Some of the coefficients in prop. \ref{BilinearFierzDecomposition} may vanish identically. These are the _bilinear Fierz identities_, of the form

$$
  \overline{\psi} \Gamma_{a_1 \cdots a_p} \psi = 0
  \,.
$$

###### Example

Let $d = 11$. Write $\mathbf{32}$ or $(\tfrac{1}{2})^5$ for the [[Majorana spinor]] representation of $Spin(d-1,1)$. Then

$$
  \left\{
    (\tfrac{1}{2})^5
      \otimes
    (\tfrac{1}{2})^5
  \right\}_{sym}
     \;\simeq\;
  \underset{\simeq \mathbb{R}^d}{\underbrace{(1)^1 (0)^4}}
    \;\oplus\;
  \underset{\simeq \wedge^2 \mathbb{R}^d}{\underbrace{(1)^2 (0)^3}}
    \;\oplus\;
  \underset{\wedge^5 \mathbb{R}^d}{\underbrace{(1)^5}}
  \,.
$$

=--

([D'Auria-Fré 82b (3.1)](#DAuriaFre82b))


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Since we know from prop. \ref{BilinearFierzDecomposition} that the right hand side has to be some direct sum of representations of the form $\wedge^p \mathbb{R}^d$, it is sufficient to check that there is only one choice of sum such that [[dimensions]] match on both sides of the equation.

Now the dimension of $\{N \otimes N\}_{sym}$ is that of the space of symmetric $32 \times 32$ matrices:

$$
  dim_{\mathbb{R}}
  \left(
     \{\mathbf{32} \otimes \mathbf{32}\}_{sym}
  \right)
   \;=\;
  \frac{1}{2}
  \left(
    32 \times 33
  \right)
   =
  528
$$

while the dimension of $\wedge^p \mathbb{R}^d$ is the [[binomial coefficient]]

$$
  dim_{\mathbb{R}}(\wedge^p \mathbb{R}^d)
   \;=\;
  \left(
    11 \atop p
  \right)
  \,.
$$


Hence the claim follows from the fact that

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    582
     & = 11 + 55 + 462
    \\
    & =
  \left(11 \atop 1\right)
   +
  \left(11 \atop 2\right)
   +
  \left(11 \atop 5\right)

### Quadrilinear Fierz identities
  {#QuadraticFierzIdentities}


Now we consider the [[direct sum]] decomposition of the [[tensor product of representations]] of _four_ copies of a [[spin representation]]. This yields the quadrilinear Fierz identities.

+-- {: .num_example #11dQuadrilinearCGCoefficients}
###### Example

The group $Spin(10,1)$ has [[rank of a Lie group|rank]] 5, and hene its [[irreducible representation|irreducible]] vector representations are labeled by [[Young diagrams]] consisting of five rows. For instance

$$
  (2)^2 (1)^2 (0)
$$

denotes the representation whose elements may be identified with tensors of the form

$$
  X_{\array{ a_1 & a_2 \\ a_3 & a_4 \\ a_5 }}
$$

which are

1. skew-symmetric in indices in the same column;

1. symmetric and trace-less in indices in the same row.

Write again $(\tfrac{1}{2})^5$ for the [[Majorana spinor]] representation. Then the following identity holds in the [[representation ring]]:

This is due to ([D'Auria-Fré 82b (3.13) and (3.28) ](#DAuriaFre82b))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The first identity is the result of equation (eq:Fierz11dB) after tracing over the indices $a_2$ and $a_3$. Under this trace both summands on the right of (eq:Fierz11dB) vanish: $X^{(\mathbf{429})}_{\array{ a_1 & a_2 \\ a_3}}$ because it is trace-free in indices in a column, and $X^{(\mathbf{165})}_{\array{a_1 a_2 a_3}}$ because it is skew-symmetric in all indices.

The second identity follows from taking the trace over the indices $a_5 and a_6$ in (eq:Fierz11dD) and of skew-symmetrizing over all indices in (eq:Fierz11dC). By the symmetry properties of the tensors on the right of both equations, in both cases all tensors vanish except, in both cases, the contribution proportional to $X^{(\mathbf{330})}_{[a_1 \cdots a_3]}$, which both identities share. So it only remains to check that the proportionality factor is 3, as claimed. By writing out the skew-symmetrization in the last term in (eq:Fierz11dD) one finds:

## Branes
 {#Branes}


We now discuss how the [[super p-branes]] arise in the guise of consecutive invariant higher [[super Lie n-algebra]] extensions of
[[super Minkowski spacetimes]]. To put this in perspective, we first
recall in

* _[The super 0-branes and Super-Minowski spacetimes](#SuperMinkowskiSpacetimes)_

(from the end of _[[geometry of physics -- supersymmetry]]_) how the relevant [[super Minkowski spacetimes]] in dimensions 3,4,6,10 and 11 themselves emerge from the [[superpoint]] in a progression of
invariant odinary [[central extensions]] of [[super Lie algebras]].
The last step in this progression (from 10d type IIA spacetime to 11d) is classified by the
cocycle for the [[D0-brane]]. Similarly we may also think of the previous steps as being related to
0-branes.

On all the super-Minkowski spacetimes that appear in this progression in
dimension 3,4,6 and 10 there exist non-trivial invariant 3-cocycles.
These are the [[nLab:WZW terms]] of the [[Green-Schwarz superstring]]
in these dimensions. Finally in $d = 11$ there is instead a nontrivial invariant 4-cocycle,
corresponding to the [[super-membrane]] in 11d (the [[M2-brane]]).
The are classical facts from the "old [[brane scan]]" which we review in

* _[The superstring and the super membrane](#TheSuperStringAndTheSuperMembrane)_

While up to this point the progression happens in [[super Lie algebra|super]] [[Lie algebra cohomology]],
now we turn to the [[homotopy theory]] of [[super L-infinity algebras]]: Just like
2-cocycles on [[super Lie algebras]] classify ordinary [[central extensions]], higher
cocycles such as the 3-cocycles and the 4-cocycles of the [[superstring]] and of the
[[supermembrane]] classify [[super Lie n-algebra]] extension of [[super Minkowski spacetime]].
This we discuss in

* _[Extended super Minkowski spacetimes](#ExtendedSuperMinkowskiSpacetime)_

Once this etension into the larger realm of [[super Lie n-algebra]] is made,
the progression continues: On the [[extended super Minkowski spacetime]]
[[super Lie n-algebras]] there appear now furhter invariant cocycles. These
correspond to the [[D-branes]] and the [[M5-brane]]. This we discuss in

* _[The super D-branes and the super  M5-brane](#SuperMinkowskiSpacetimes)_

This yields a complete account of the brane species of [[string theory]]/[[M-theory]]
separately. Next we discuss how these separate cocycles interact (by twisting each other)
and then unify to single but [[non-abelian cohomology|non-abelian]] cocycles. This
is the topic of the next section _[Fields](#Fields)_.

###### Proposition

Consider the [[superpoint]]

$$
  \;\;\;\;\;\; \mathbb{R}^{0\vert 1}
$$

regarded as an abelian [[super Lie algebra]] (def. \ref{SuperLieAlgebraAsLieAlgebraInternalToSuperVectorSpaces}, prop. \ref{SuperLieAlgebraTraditional}). Its maximal [[central extension]] is the $N = 1$ super-[[worldline]] of the [[superparticle]]:

$$
  \array{
    \mathbb{R}^{0,1\vert \mathbf{1}}
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbb{R}^{0\vert 1}
  }
  \,.
$$

* whose even part is spanned by one generator $H$

* whose odd part is spanned by one generator $Q$

* the only non-trivial bracket is

  $$
    \{Q, Q\} = H
  $$

Then consider the [[superpoint]] with two odd dimensions

$$
  \;\;\;\;\;\; \mathbb{R}^{0\vert 2}
  \,,
$$

which is the [[coproduct]] of the atomic 2-cocycle over its
bosonic part $\overset{\rightsquigarrow}{\mathbb{R}^{0 \vert 1}} \simeq \mathbb{R}^0$.


Its maximal [[central extension]] is
the $d = 3$, $N = 1$ [[super Minkowski spacetime]] (def. \ref{SuperMinkowskiSpacetime})

$$
  \array{
    \mathbb{R}^{2,1\vert \mathbf{2}}
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbb{R}^{0\vert 2}
  }
  \,.
$$

* whose even part is $\mathbb{R}^3$, spanned by generators $P_0, P_1, P_2$

* whose odd part is $\mathbb{R}^2$, regarded as

  the [[Majorana spinor]] representation $\mathbf{2}$

  of $Spin(2,1) \simeq SL(2,\mathbb{R})$

* the only non-trivial bracket is the spinor bilinear pairing

  $$
    \{Q_\alpha, Q'_\beta\}
    =
     C_{\alpha \alpha'} \Gamma_a{}^{\alpha'}{}_\beta

###### Theorem
**([J. Huerta](#MTheoryFromTheSuperpoint))

The [[diagram]] of [[super Lie algebras]] shown on the right

is obtained by consecutively forming maximal central extensions invariant with respect to the maximal subgroup of automorphisms for which there are invariant cocycles at all. Here $\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert \mathbf{N}}$ is the $d$, $\mathbf{N}$ super-translation [[supersymmetry]] algebra. And these subgroups are the [[spin group]] covers $Spin(d-1,1)$ of the [[Lorentz groups]] $O(d-1,1)$.

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

That every [[super Minkowski spacetime]] is _some_ [[central extension]] of some [[superpoint]]  is elementary.
This was highlighted in ([Chryssomalakos-Azcárraga-Izquierdo-Bueno 99,
2.1](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Green-Schwarz+action+functional#CAIB99)).
But most central extensions of superpoints
are nothing like super-Minkowksi spacetimes.
The point of the above proposition
is to restrict attention to _iterated invariant_ central extensions
and to find that these single out the super-Minkowski spacetimes.

=--

So from studying iterated invariant [[central extensions]]
of [[super Lie algebras]],
starting with the [[superpoint]],
we  (re-)discover

1. [[pseudo-Riemannian geometry|Lorentzian geometry]],

1. [[spin geometry]].

1. [[super spacetimes]].

This happens to also be the [[curvature]] of the [[WZW-term]]
in the [[Green-Schwarz sigma-model]] for the [[D0-brane]]. We come back to this

**([Achúcarro-Evans-Townsend-Wiltshire 87](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Green-Schwarz+action+functional#AETW87), [Azcárraga-Townsend 89](Green-Schwarz+action+functional#AzcarragaTownsend89) [Brandt 12-13](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Green-Schwarz+action+functional#Brandt12-13))**

The maximal invariant 3-cocycle on 10d [[super Minkowski spacetime]] (according to remark \ref{SuperMinkowskiInvariantCocycles}) is

$$
  \mu_{F1} = \left(\overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma_a \psi\right) \wedge e^a
$$

This is the [[WZW term]] for the [[Green-Schwarz superstring]] ([Green-Schwarz 84](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Green-Schwarz+action+functional#GreenSchwarz84)).

The maximal invariant 4-cocycle on [[super Minkowski spacetime]] is

$$
  \mu_{M2} = \tfrac{i}{2} \left(\overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma_{a b} \psi \right) \wedge e^a \wedge e^b

This is the [[higher WZW term]] for the [[supermembrane]]
([Bergshoeff-Sezgin-Townsend 87](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/M2-brane#BergshoeffSezginTownsend87)).

Notice that the entries of this table lie on four diagonal lines.
It turns out that each cocycle below and to the left of another cocycle
arises from it by an super Lie alghebraic incarnation of [[double dimensional reduction]].
This we discuss below in _[Double dimensional reduction](#DoubleDimensionalReduction)_


+-- {: .num_remark #TheWZWTermsForStringAndMembrane}
###### Remark

Here "**[[higher WZW term]]**" means the following:


Regard $\mu_{F1} = \left(\overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma_a \psi\right) \wedge e^a$
as a left [[invariant differential form]]
on [[super-Minkowski spacetime]].
Choose any differential form potential $B_{F1}$, i.e. such that

$$
  d_{dR} B_{F1} = \left(\overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma_a \psi\right) \wedge e^a
  \,.
$$

(This $B_{F1}$ will _not be left-invariant_.)

Then the [[Green-Schwarz action functional]] for the [[superstring]]
is the function on the space of [[sigma-model]] [[field (physics)|fields]]

$$
  \phi \;\colon\; \underset{\text{worldsheet}}{\underbrace{\Sigma_2}}
    \longrightarrow
    \underset{\text{super-spacetime}}{\underbrace{\mathbb{R}^{9,1\vert \mathbf{N}}}}

$$
  \phi

$$

The first term is the [[Nambu-Goto action]] the second is a [[WZW term]].

$\,$

Originally [Green-Schwarz 84](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Green-Schwarz+action+functional#GreenSchwarz84) introduced $B_{F1}$
to ensure an additional fermionic symmetry: "[[kappa-symmetry]]".

Notice that $B_{F1}$ looks somewhat complicated
and is not unique. That it is simply a [[WZW-term]]
for the [[supersymmetry]] [[supergroup]]

$$
  \mathbb{R}^{9,1\vert \mathbf{N}}
   =
  Iso(\mathbb{R}^{9,1\vert \mathbf{N}}) / Spin(9,1)

was observed in [Henneaux-Mezincescu 85](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/source/Green-Schwarz+action+functional#HenneauxMezincescu85).

$\,$

Similarly, choose any differential form potential $C_{M2}$ such that

$$
  d_{dR} C_{M2} = \left(\overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma_{a b} \psi\right) \wedge e^a \wedge e^b
  \,.
$$

(This $C_{M2}$ will _not be left-invariant_.)

Then the [[Green-Schwarz action functional|Green-Schwarz type action functional]]
for the [[supermembrane]] is the function on [[sigma-model]] [[field (physics)|fields]]

$$
  \phi \;\colon\; \underset{\text{worldvolume}}{\underbrace{\Sigma_3}} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^{10,1\vert \mathbf{32}}

      d b_2 = \mu_{F1}^{het} = (\overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma_a \psi)\wedge e^a

This is a super-version of the _[[string Lie 2-algebra]]_ ([Baez-Crans-Schreiber-Stevenson 05](#BCSS05)
which controls [[Green-Schwarz anomaly cancellation]] ([Sati-Schreiber-Stasheff 12](#SatiSchreiberStasheff12))

This dg-algebra was first considered  in [D'Auria-Fré 82 (3.15)](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/D'Auria-Fre+formulation+of+supergravity#DAuriaFre)

For instance there are string and membrane GS-WZW-terms / cocycles also on the lower dimensional super-Minkowski spacetimes ("non-critical"), e.g. the [[super 1-brane in 3d]] and the [[super 2-brane in 4d]].)

### The M5-brane and the D-branes

The "old [[brane scan]]" classifying the [[superstring]] and the [[supermembrane]]

Given that  [[superstrings]] and [[supermembranes]] are nicely classified by [[super Lie algebra]] [[Lie algebra cohomology|cohomology]]

why do the other [[super p-branes]] known in [[string theory]] not show up similarly? Where are the [[D-branes]] and the [[M5-brane]]?


But from the discussion [above](#ExtendedSuperMinkowskiSpacetime) we see that we should look for
further higher cocycles not on [[super Lie algebras]]
but the [[super L-∞ algebras]]: on the [[extended super Minkowski spacetimes]] of def. \ref{TheMembraneAndStringCocycles}.

Here the identity under the brace is the [[Fierz identity]] from prop. \ref{TheM2andM5CocyclesAsFierzIdentities}.

=--

Notice how it is the presence of the extra higher generator $h_3$ of degree 3 in $CE(\mathfrak{m}2\mathfrak{brane})$ that
makes prop. \ref{TheM5BraneCocycle} work.

That the element $\mu_{M5}$ in def. \ref{TheM5BraneCocycleAsACocycle} is the curvature of the [[higher dimensional WZW model|higher WZW-term]]
of the [[M5-brane]] was argued in [BLNPST97 ](M5-brane#BLNPST97)

It turns out that from just prop. \ref{TheM5BraneCocycleAsACocycle} one obtains the [[D-brane]] cocycles in 10d by applying
[[super Lie n-algebra]] constructions corresponding to
[[double dimensional reduction]] and [[topological T-duality]].
This we discuss below in _[Double dimensional reduction](#DoubleDimensionalReduction)_
and in _[T-duality](#TDuality)_.

Here for the moment we just state the resulting cocycle conditions, below as def. \ref{TheDBraneCocycles},
prop. \ref{TheIIADBraneCocycles} and prop. \ref{TheCocyclesForTheIIBTypeDBranes}.
In order to state this conveniently, we first recall in def. \ref{ConvenientSpinorBasis} the
well adapted bases for type IIA/IIB spinors from _[[geometry of physics -- supersymmetry]]_
_[Example: Spinors in dimension 11, 10 and 9](geometry+of+physics+--+supersymmetry#InDimensions11And10And9)_

###### Definition
**(basis for IIA/IIB spinors)**

Let $\{\gamma_a\}_{a = 0}^{d-1}$ be a [[Dirac representation]] on $\mathbb{C}^{16}$ of the Lorentzian $d= 9$
  Clifford algebra $Cl(8,1)$. We obtain a Dirac representation of the $d = 10$ and $d = 11$ Clifford algebra by taking the following block matrices acting on $\mathbb{C}^{16} \oplus \mathbb{C}^{16}$
  $$
  \Gamma_{a \leq 8}
  \coloneqq
  \left(
   \array{
       0 & \gamma^a
       \\
       \gamma^a & 0
    }
  \right)
  \;, \qquad
  \Gamma_9
  \coloneqq
  \left(
    \array{
      0 & \mathrm{I}
      \\
      -\mathrm{I} & 0
    }
  \right)
  \;, \qquad
  \Gamma_{10}
  \coloneqq
  \left(
    \array{
      i \mathrm{I} & 0
      \\
      0 & -i \mathrm{I}
    }
  \right)
  \,,
$$
where $I$ is the identity matrix.


 The unique irreducible [[Majorana spinor]] representation of $\mathrm{Spin}(10,1)$ is of real dimension 32.
  Under the inclusions
  $$
    \mathrm{Spin}(8,1) \hookrightarrow \mathrm{Spin}(9,1) \hookrightarrow \mathrm{Spin}(10,1)
  $$
  this representation branches as
  $$
    \mathbf{32} \mapsto \mathbf{16}\oplus \overline{\mathbf{16}} \mapsto \mathbf{16} \oplus \mathbf{16}
    \,,
  $$
  where in the middle $\mathbf{16}$ and $\overline{\mathbf{16}}$ are the left and right chiral Majorana-Weyl
  representations in 10d, while on the right the $\mathbf{16}$ is again the unique irreducible real
  representation in 9d.
 Under this branching we decompose a Majorana spinor $\psi \in \mathbf{32}$ as
  $$
    \psi
    =
    \left(
      \array{
        \psi_1
        \\
        \psi_2
      }
    \right)
  $$
  with $\psi_1 \in \mathbf{16}$ and $\psi_2 \in \overline{\mathbf{16}}$ or $\mathbf{16}$.


  Define another set of matrices $\{\Gamma_a^B\}_{a = 0}^{9}$
  by
  $$
    \Gamma_a^{B}
     :=
    \left\{
      \array{
         \Gamma_a & \vert \; a \leq 8\;,
         \\
         \begin{pmatrix}
              0 & \mathrm{I}
              \\
              \mathrm{I} & 0
           \end{pmatrix}
         &
         \vert \; a = 9\;.
      }
    \right.
  $$
  For emphasis we write the original matrices also as $\Gamma_a^A := \Gamma_a$, for $a \leq 9$.

  Moreover we also write
  $$
    \sigma_1 := \Gamma_9
    \;\,,\;\;\;\;\;
    \sigma_2 := -\Gamma_{9} \Gamma_{10}
    \;\,,\;\;\;\;\;
    \sigma_3 := \Gamma_{10}
    \,.
  $$

  Noice that the matrices $\{\Gamma^B_a\}_{a = 0}^9$ in  do not represent
  a Clifford algebra, but the product of any even number of them represents the correct such
  product acting on $\mathbf{16} \oplus \mathbf{16}$. For instance $\exp(\omega^{a b}\Gamma^B_{a b})$
  are the elements of the $\mathrm{Spin}(d-1,1)$-representation on $\mathbf{16}\oplus \mathbf{16}$.
  Also, for \emph{odd} $p = 2k+1$, each of the pairings
  $$
    \overline{\psi}\Gamma^B_{a_1 \cdots a_p}\psi
      =
    \psi^\dagger \Gamma^B_0 \Gamma^B_{a_1 \cdots a_p} \psi
  $$
  is the sum of the corresponding pairings on two copies of $\mathbf{16}$.


By these definition we have
  $$
    \Gamma_9^B = i \, \Gamma_9 \Gamma_{10} = \Gamma_9 \Gamma_{11}
    \,.
  $$

This relation also makes it manifest that $\Gamma_9^B$ commutes not only with all $\Gamma^B_{a b}$ for $a,b \leq 8$, but also with all $\Gamma_a^B\Gamma_9^B$. Consequently, $\Gamma_{10}$ as well as $\Gamma_9$ are invariant under the IIB Spin-action, in that

  $$
    \exp(-\omega^{a b}\Gamma^B_{a b}) \; \sigma_i \; \exp(\omega^{a b} \Gamma^B_{a b})
      =
    \sigma_i
  $$

for $i \in \{1,2,3\}$.

Conversely, rotation in the $(9,10)$-plane leaves all the $\Gamma_a^B$ invariant, in that

  $$
    \exp(- \tfrac{\alpha}{4} \Gamma_9 \Gamma_{10}) \,\Gamma_a^B\, \exp(\tfrac{\alpha}{4} \Gamma_9 \Gamma_{10})
      \;=\;
    \Gamma_a^B
    \,.

Notice that all the [[D-brane]] cocycle $\mu_{D p}$ in def. \ref{TheDBraneCocycles} are _higher_ cocycles

The ordinary central extension that this classifies
is just that which grows the 11th M-theory dimension by the above example \ref{D0Cocycle}.

as an element of $\mathbb{R}^{9,1\vert \mathbf{16}+ \overline{\mathbf{16}^\ast}}$
or as the element $\mu_{D0}$ of $\mathfrak{string}_{IIA}$ (which in components are the same,
just regarded in different contexts), then the relation between the D0-brane and the M-theory spacetime

precisely if the given species of $p_1$-branes may end on the given species of $p_2$-branes
(more discussion of this is in [Fiorenza-Sati-Schreiber 13, section 3](#FSS13)).

But recall from prop. \ref{GaugeStackInsideExtendedSpacetime} the interpretation of the [[extended super Minkowski spacetimes]]
as containing a condensate of branes sourcing the gauge field on the worldvolume of the
branes that they may end on.

In conclusion this shows that
given a cocycle $\mu_{p_1+2}$ for some super $p_1$-brane species
inducing an [[extended super Minkowski spacetime]] via its [[homotopy fiber]]
and then given a consecutive cocycle $\mu_{p_2+2}$ for a $p_2$-brane species on that homotopy fiber
then $p_1$-branes may end on $p_2$-branes
and the $p_2$-branes propagating in the extended spacetime $p_1 \mathfrak{brane}$
see a higher gauge field on their worldvolume
of the kind sourced by boundaries of $p_1$-branes.

    {
      \text{spacetime}
      \atop
      \text{with}\,p_1\text{-brane condensate}

$$

$\,$

Hence the [[extended super Minkowski spacetime]] $p_1 \mathfrak{brane}$
is like the original super spacetime $\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert \mathbf{N}}$
but filled with a [[condensation|condensate]] of $p_1$-branes
whose boundaries source a [[higher gauge field]].


$\,$

While this is good,
it means that at each stage of the [[schreiber:brane bouquet]]
we are describing $p_2$-brane dynamics
on a fixed $p_1$-brane [[background field]].
But more generally
we would like to describe the joint dynamics
of all brane species at once.

This we turn to now.

## Fields
 {#Fields}


In the discussion [above](#Branes) we discovered all the [[p-brane]] species of [[string theory]]/[[M-theory]],
but each separately as a $b^{p+1}\mathbb{R}$-valued super $L_\infty$-cocycle on some
[[extended super Minkowski spacetime]] classified by a previous cocycle.

Here we discuss that all these cocycles unify into single cocycles.
However, these unified cocycles are no longer in [[ordinary cohomology]], meaning that they
no longer have
[[coefficients]] in the simple [[line Lie-n algebras]] $b^{p+1}\mathbb{R}$ as in proposition \ref{HomotopyFibersOfLInfinityCocycles}.

Instead they have coefficients in richer and in general non-abelian [[L-∞ algebras]].
One says they ar [[cocycles]] in [[non-abelian cohomology]] theory.
By a phenomenon that has been called the [[Whitehead principle of non-abelian cohomology]],
this means more concretely that these unified cocycles are in a
_[[twisted cohomology|twisted]] [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] theory_.
Command of the general concept of this name is not strictly necessary for the
analysis of the brane cocycles below, but a rough idea of its basic ingredients
will make the meaning of the constructions and results very transparent. Therefore we
start below with a lighning overview of the idea

* _[Twisted generalizzed cohomology](#TwistedGeneralizedCohomology)_

Since [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology|generalized cohomology]] is generally exhibited
by classifying [[spaces]], specifically [[topological spaces]], to make use of these
concepts we need a way to regard [[L-∞ algebras]] as certain spaces (or rather as [[homotopy types]] of certain spaces).
This connection is provided by a theory called _[[rational homotopy theory]]_. Again, this is
not strictly necessary for the derivation of the unified brane cocycles below, but it serves to
greatly clarify the resulting structures. Therefore we next give a lightning survey of

* _[Rational homotopy theory](#RationalHomotopyTheory)_.

After these conceptual preliminaries, we then turn to the concrete example of the [[schreiber:brane bouquet]]
established [above](#Branes)
and ask for homotopy descent of consecutive ordinary cocycles on [[extended super Minkowski spacetimes]]
to single but twisted generalized cocycles down on plain [[super Minkowski spacetimes]].

First we consider this for the [[D-branes]] and we derive that the unified F1/Dp-brane cocycles
exist with coefficients the [[rationalization]] of [[twisted K-theory]]. This is the content of the section

* _[RR-Fields](#RRFields)_.


In direct analogy, we then discover the corresponding rationalized coefficients for the [[background fields]]
for the [[M-branes]]. This turns out to be rationalized [[cohomotopy]] in degree 4. This we discuss in

* _[M-Flux Fields](#MFluxFields)_

More technically, what we show now is that
there is _homotopy [[descent]]_ of $p$-brane cocycles
from [[extended super Minkowski spacetime]]
down to ordinary [[super Minkowski spacetime]]
which yields cocycles in [[twisted cohomology]]
for the [[RR-field]] and the M-flux fields ([Fiorenza-Sati-Schreiber 15](#FSS15), [16a](#FSS16a)).

$\,$

### Twisted generalized cohomology
 {#TwistedGeneralizedCohomology}


There is a traditional physics story for how [[twisted cohomology|twisted]] [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]]
appears on [[D-branes]]. Eventually we are after a precise derivation of this phenomenon from "first principles",
but as motivation and for intuition, it serves to recall the folklore:


It is often stated that a
[[Chan-Paton gauge field]] on $n$ coincident [[D-branes]]
is an [[special unitary group|SU(n)]]-[[vector bundle]] $V$,
hence a cocycle in [[nonabelian cohomology]] in degree 1.

But this is not quite true.
In general there are $n$ [[D-branes]] and $n'$ [[anti-D-branes]] coinciding,
carrying [[Chan-Paton gauge fields]]
$V_{brane}$ (of [[rank]] $n$) and $V_{\text{anti-brane}}$ (of rank $n'$), respectively,
yielding a pair of [[vector bundles]]
$$
  (V_{\text{brane}}, V_{\text{anti-brane}})
  \,.
$$
Such pairs are also called _[[virtual vector bundles]]_.


But [[D-branes]] annihilate with [[anti-D-branes]] ([Sen 98](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/anti+D-brane#Sen98))
when they are coincident and have exact opposite [[D-brane charge]],
which here means that they carry the same [[Chan-Paton gauge field|Chan-Paton]] vector bundle.
In other words, pairs as above of the special form
$(W,W)$ are equivalent to pairs of the form $(0,0)$.

$$
  (W,W)
    \;\sim\;
  0
  \,.
$$

Hence the net Chan-Paton charge of coincident branes and anti-branes
is really the [[equivalence class]] of $(V_{\text{brane}}, V_{\text{anti-brane}})$
under the [[equivalence relation]] which is generated by the [[relation]]

$$
  (V_{\text{brane}} \oplus W\,,\; V_{\text{anti-brane}} \oplus W)
    \;\sim\;
  (V_{brane}\,,\; V_{anti-brane})
$$

for all [[complex vector bundles]] $W$ ([Witten 98](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/anti+D-brane#Witten98),
[Witten 00](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/D-brane#Witten00)).

$\,$

The additive [[abelian group]] of such equivalence classes of [[virtual vector bundles]]
is called _[[topological K-theory]].
This behaves in many ways as [[ordinary cohomology]] does,  but is richer.
One says that it is a _[[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology|generalized cohomology theory]]_.


Hence by this story, [[D-brane charge]] should take values in [[twisted K-theory]].
Therefore, by the analog of the [[Maxwell equations]] for [[RR-fields]], where [[D-brane charge]] plays
the role of [[electric charge]] and [[magnetic charge]] in [[electromagnetism]]
also the [[RR-fields]] must be [[cocycles]] in [[twisted K-theory]]
([Moore-Witten 00](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/anti+D-brane#MooreWitten99)).

$\,$

A famous fact about [[ordinary cohomology]] $H^n(X,\mathbb{Z})$ is that it is _represented_
by [[topological spaces]] denoted $K(\mathbb{Z},n)$ or $B^n \mathbb{Z}$ and called
_[[Eilenberg-MacLane spaces]]_: For $X$ a [[paracompact topological space]] then there is a [[natural bijection]]

$$
  H^n(X,\mathbb{Z})
    \;\simeq\;
  \left\{
    X \;\longrightarrow\; B^n \mathbb{Z}
  \right\}_{/homotopy}
$$

between [[cohomology]] classes of $X$  and [[homotopy classes]] of [[continuous maps]] from $X$ to the
[[Eilenberg-MacLane space]]. (This turns out to uniquely characterize the spaces $B^n \mathbb{Z}$.)

The collection of all these [[Eilenberg-MacLane spaces]] $B^n \mathbb{Z}$, as $n$ ranges, has the property
that each is the [[based loop space]] of the previous one, up to [[weak homotopy equivalence]]

$$
  B^n \mathbb{Z}
  \underoverset{\text{weak hom. equivalence}}{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  \Omega_\ast \left( B^{n+1}\mathbb{Z} \right)
  \,.
$$

More generally, in [[algebraic topology]] any sequence of [[pointed topological spaces]] $E_n$ indexed by the [[natural numbers]] and
equipped with such [[weak homotopy equivalences]]

$$
  E_n \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} \Omega_\ast \left(  E_{n+1} \right)
$$

is called a _[[spectrum]]_, or specifically an _[[Omega-spectrum]]_.
See at _[[geometry of physics -- stable homotopy types]]_ for more on this.

Here for $X$ any [[pointed topological space]],
$\Omega X$ denotes the operation of constructing the [[based loop space|space of continuous loops]]
in $X$, starting and ending at the given basepoint. For later use we mention that a fancy-looking but
most useful alternative way to think of a such as loop is as a _[[homotopy]]_ from the basepoint to itself.
Thought of this way, then the based loop space is equivalently the [[homotopy fiber product]] of the
base point inclusion with itself, denoted as follows:

$$
  \Omega_\ast \left( X  \right)
    \;\simeq\;
  \underset{
    \text{homotopy} \atop \text{fiber product}
  }{
  \underbrace{
    \ast \underoverset{X}{h}{\times} \ast
  }
  }
  \,.
$$

In direct analogy to the above situation, one says for $E_\bullet$ any such
[[Omega-spectrum]] that the [[homotopy classes]] of [[continuous maps]]
into its component space in degree $n$

$$
  E^n(X)
   \;\coloneqq\;
  \left\{
    X \longrightarrow E_n
  \right\}_{/\text{homotopy}}
$$

are the $E$-[[generalized cohomology]] classes of $X$ i degree $n$.

One also says that the cohomology theory $E^\bullet(-)$ is
_[[generalized cohomology theory]] is [[Brown representability theorem|represented]]_ by the _[[spectrum]]_ $E$.


The example of interest for D-brane charge, [[topological K-theory]], is the [[generalized cohomology theory]] denoted by

$$
  E = KU
$$

with

$$
  KU_{2n} \simeq (B U) \times \mathbb{Z}
  \;\;\,,\;\;
  KU_{2n+1} \simeq U
$$

where

1. $U$ denotes the [[stable unitary group]],

1. $B U$ denotes the [[classifying space]] for [[complex vector bundles]].

So in this case a [[cocycle]] is represented by the [[homotopy class]] of a map of the form

$$
  \left(V_{brane}, n_{\text{anti-brane}} \right)
   \;\colon\;
  X \overset{}{\longrightarrow} (B U) \times \mathbb{Z}
$$

which gives a [[complex vector bundle]] $V_{\text{brane}}$ and the trivial vector bundle $\mathbb{C}^{n_{\text{anti-brane}}}$
of [[rank]] $n_{\text{anti-brane}}$, hence a [[virtual vector bundle]] of the form

$$
  (V_{\text{brane}}, \mathbb{C}^{n_{\text{anti-brane}}})
  \,.
$$

A basic fact proven in [[topological K-theory]] is that the K-theory class of every [[virtual vector bundle]]
is represented by one of this form, and it is in this way that $KU_0 = (B U) \times \mathbb{Z}$
is the [[coefficient]] space for [[topological K-theory]].


But this is not yet the full story:
Above we saw
that the [[Chan-Paton gauge field]] on a D-brane
is actually a _[[twisted vector bundle]]_
with twist given by the [[Kalb-Ramond field|Kalb-Ramond]] [[B-field]]
sourced by a string condensate.
([[Freed-Witten anomaly cancellation]]).



Such _[[twisted cohomology|twisted]]_ [[generalized cohomology]] is given by
generalizing the above concept of [[Omega-spectra]] by allowing the base point $\ast$ to
become a _classifying space of twists_. The result is called a _[[parameterized spectrum]]_.
Such consists of:

1. a classifying space of twists $B G$

1. a _[[spectrum object]] in the [[slice category]] $Top_{/B G}$_, namely a sequence of spaces, denoted $E_n/G$, equipped with maps

   $$
     id \;\colon\; B G \to E_n/G \to B G
   $$

   and [[weak homotopy equivalences]] from the $n$th space to the [[homotopy fiber product]] of space inclusion of the space of twists with itself:

   $$
     E_n/G
       \overset{\phantom{AA}\simeq\phantom{AA} }{\longrightarrow}
    \Omega_{B G} (E_{n+1}/G)
      \coloneqq
    \underset{\text{homotopy} \atop {\text{fiber} \atop \text{product} } }{\underbrace{
     B G
       \underoverset{E_{n+1}/G}{h}{\times}
     B G
     }}
   $$

To get a feeling for this definition, consider two extremal cases of [[parameterized spectra]]:

1. An ordinary spectrum $E$ is a parameterized spectrum over the point (i.e. no twists);

   $$
     \array{
       E
       \\
       \downarrow
       \\
       \ast
     }
   $$

1. An ordinary [[topological space]] $X$ is identified with the [[zero-spectrum]] parameterized over $X$, which is just

   $$
     \array{
       X
       \\
       \downarrow^{\mathrlap{id}}
       \\
       X
     }
   $$


Hence a general [[parameterized spectrum]] interpolates between these two extremes, it combines the
[[non-abelian cohomology]] represented by [[topological spaces]] such as $B U$ with the abelian cohomology
[[Brown representability theorem|represented]] by [[spectra]]:

More in detail, given a [[parameterized spectrum]] $E$ over $B G$, then
we have the following elegant picture of twisted $E$-cohomology ([NSS 12, section 4.1](#NSS12)):

1. A _twist_ $\tau$ for the $E$-cohomology of some [[topological space]] $X$ is a map

   $$
     \array{
       X
       \\
       & {}_{\mathllap{\tau}}\searrow
       \\
       && B G
     }
   $$

   from $X$ to the spectrum's classifying space of twists.

1. The _$\tau$-twisted $E$-cohomology_ of $X$ in degree $n$ is the set of [[homotopy classes]]
   of maps $X \overset{\phi}{\longrightarrow} E_n/G$  together with a [[homotopy]] $p_n \circ \phi \simeq \tau$:

   $$
    E^{n+\tau}(X)
      \;\coloneqq\;
    \left\{
     \array{
       X && \longrightarrow && E_n/G
       \\
       & {}_{\mathllap{\tau}} \searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{p_n}}
       \\
       && B G
     }
     \right\}_{/\text{homotopy}}
   $$

1. There is a [[homotopy fiber sequence]] (in parameterized spectra)

   $$
     \array{
       E &\longrightarrow& E/G
       \\
       && \downarrow
       \\
       && B G
     }
   $$

   and this equivalently exhibits $E/G$ as the [[homotopy quotient]] of an ordinary spectrum $E$ by a
[[infinity-action|coherent homotopy action]] of $G$.


We now translate this situation from topological spaces to [[super L-∞ algebras]]
via the central theorem of [[rational homotopy theory]], which we now recall.

$\,$

### Rational homotopy theory
 {#RationalHomotopyTheory}

Recall from the discussion [above](#SuperLInfinityCohomologyAndFDAs)
that an [[L-∞ algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ may be thought of as a [[Lie algebra]] "up to [[coherence|coherent]] higher [[homotopy]]":
with the unary bracket $[-]$ regarded as a differential $\partial \coloneqq [-]$, then for instance the trinary bracket is a
[[chain homotopy]] up to which the [[Jacobi identity]] holds

$$
  [x,[y,z]]
    \underoverset{\simeq}{\partial [x,y,z]}{\longrightarrow}
  [[x,y],z] \pm [y,[x,z]]
  \,.
$$

In direct analogy, for $X$ any [[pointed topological space]], then the
[[based loop space]] $\Omega_\ast(X)$ (the [[topological space]] whose elements are
continuous paths from the basepoint to itself) naturally is a [[group]] "up to [[coherence|coherent]] higher homotopy".

Namely

* the operation of concatenating two loops $\alpha,\beta \colon [0,1] \to X$ to a new loop

  $$
    [0,1] \overset{2 \cdot(-)}{\longrightarrow} [0,2]
     \overset{}{\longrightarrow}
    X
  $$

  gives it the structure of a [[semi-group]] whose [[associativity]] law holds up to [[homotopy]];

* the constant loop gives it the structure of a [[monoid]] up to coherent homotopy, called an _[[A-∞ space]]_

* the reversal of loops

  $$
    [0,1] \overset{1-(-)}{\longrightarrow} [0,1] \overset{\alpha}{\longrightarrow} X
  $$

  finally gives it [[inverses]] up to homotopy and makes it what is called a  a _grouplike [[A-∞ space]]_ or _[[∞-group]]_ for short.



Conversely, for $G$ any [[∞-group]]
then there is an essentially unique [[connected topological space|connected]] space $B G$
with $G \;\simeq\; \Omega B G$ (the _[[May recognition theorem]]_).



Now in a similar manner, every double loop space $\Omega_\ast(\Omega_\ast(X))$
becomes a "first order abelian" [[∞-group]]
by exchanging loop directons. This may be called a _[[braided ∞-group]]_,

$\,$

Hence for $G$ a [[braided ∞-group]] then
$B G$ is itself an [[∞-group]]
and so there exists an essentially unique [[simply connected topological space|simply connected]] space

$$
  B^2 G \coloneqq B (B G)
$$

with

$$
  G \;\simeq\; \Omega^2 B^2 G
  \,.
$$

$\,$


And so forth:

Every triple loop space $\Omega^3 X$

becomes a "second order abelian" [[∞-group]]

by exchanging loop directons

called a _[[sylleptic ∞-group]]_.

etc.

$\,$

In a [[spectrum]] $E$,

the maps $E_n \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} \Omega E_{n+1}$

exhbit $E_0$ as an [[infinite loop space]]

hence as a fully [[abelian ∞-group]].

$\,$

It turns out that by a [[homotopy theory|homotopy theoretic]] version of [[Lie theory]],

there is an [[L-∞ algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ associated with any [[∞-group]]

$$
  \mathfrak{g} \simeq  \mathfrak{l} B G
  \,.
$$

or

$$
  B\mathfrak{g} \simeq  \mathfrak{l} B^2 G
$$

etc.

$\,$

Its [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] $CE(\mathfrak{B g})$

is called a _[[Sullivan model]]_ for $B^2 G$.

$\,$

For **example** the $L_\infty$-algebra associated with an [[Eilenberg-MacLane space]]

$$
  K(\mathbb{Z},n+1) \simeq B^{n+1}\mathbb{Z}
$$

is the [[line Lie-n algebra]] from above:

$$
  \mathfrak{l}(B^{n+1} \mathbb{Z})
    \;\simeq\;
  B^n \mathbb{R}
  \,.
$$

$\,$

The **main theorem of [[rational homotopy theory]]**  ([Quillen 69](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/rational+homotopy+theory#Quillen69),
[Sullivan 77](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/rational+homotopy+theory#Sullivan77))

says that the [[L-∞ algebra]] $\mathfrak{l}(B^2 G)$ equivalently reflects the _[[rationalization]]_ of $B^2 G$

(in fact the real-ification, since we are considering $L_\infty$-algebras over the real numbers).

This means that weak equivalence between $L_\infty$-algebras correspond to maps between spaces

that induce [[isomorphism]] on real-ified [[homotopy groups]]

$$
  \left\{
    \;\;\;\;\;
    \array{
      B^2 G_1
        \overset{\phantom{AA}f\phantom{AA}}{\longrightarrow}
      B^2 G_2
      \\
      \text{such that:}
      \\
      \pi_\bullet(B^2 G_1)\otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} \mathbb{R}
         \underoverset{\simeq}{\pi_\bullet(f) \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} \mathbb{R}   }{\longrightarrow}
      \pi_\bullet(B^2 G_2) \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} \mathbb{R}

$\,$

We now work out this general prescription

for the cocycles in the [[schreiber:brane bouquet]].

$\,$

### RR-fields
 {#RRFields}

$\,$

By the [[schreiber:brane bouquet]] above

the type IIA [[D-branes]]

are given by super $L_\infty$ cocycles of the form

$$
  \mathfrak{string}_{IIA }
    \overset{\mu_{Dp}}{\longrightarrow}
  B^{p+1}\mathbb{R}
$$

for $p \in \{0,2,4,6,8,10\}$.

$\,$

Notice that

$$
  H^\bullet(B U, \mathbb{Z})
$$

has one generator in each even degree, the [[universal Chern classes]].

Hence the $L_\infty$-algebra

$$
  \mathfrak{l}(KU)
$$

is given by

$$
  CE(\mathfrak{l}(KU))
    \;\simeq\;
  \left\{
    d \omega_{2p+2} = 0
    \;\vert\;
    p \in \mathbb{Z}
  \right\}
  \,.
$$

This allows to unify the D-brane cocycles

into a single morphism of super $L_\infty$-algebras of the form


$$
  \array{
     \mathfrak{string}_{IIA}
     &&
     \stackrel{\phantom{AA}\mu_D\phantom{AA}}{\longrightarrow}
     &&
     \mathfrak{l}(KU)
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{hofib(\mu_{F1})}}\downarrow
     \\
     \mathbb{R}^{9,1\vert \mathbf{16}+ \overline{\mathbf{16}}}
     \\
     & {}_{\mathllap{\mu_{F1}}}\searrow
     \\
     &&
     \mathbf{B}^2 \mathbb{R}
  }
  \,.
$$

$\,$

By the above prescription, descending $\mu_D$ is equivalent

to finding a [[commuting diagram]] in the [[homotopy category]] of super $L_\infty$-algebras

of the form

$$
  \array{
     \mathfrak{string}_{IIA}
     &&
     \stackrel{\phantom{AA}\mu_D\phantom{AA}}{\longrightarrow}
     &&

     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{hofib(\phi)}}

     \text{something}

     \\
     &&
     \mathbf{B}^2 \mathbb{R}
  }
  \,.
$$

$\,$

This turns out to exist as follows ([Fiorenza-Sati-Schreiber 16a, section 5](#FSS16a)):

Define the $L_\infty$-algebra

$$
  \mathfrak{l}(KU / BU(1))
$$

by

$$
  CE\left(\mathfrak{l}(KU / BU(1))\right)
  \;=\;
  \left\{
    \array{
      d h_3 = 0\;,\;
      \\
      d \omega_{2p+2} = h_3 \wedge \omega_{2p}
    }
  \right\}
  \,.
$$

Moreover write

$$
  \mathbb{R}^{9,1\vert \mathbf{16} + \overline{\mathbf{16}}}_{res}
$$

for the super $L_\infty$-algebra whose [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] is

$$
  CE\left(
    \mathbb{R}^{9,1\vert \mathbf{16} + \overline{\mathbf{16}}}_{res}
  \right)[f_2,h_3]/(d f_2 = \mu_{F1} + h_3)

###### Proposition
**([Fiorenza-Sati-Schreiber 16a, theorem 4.16](#FSS16a))**

The super $L_\infty$-algebra $\mathbb{R}^{9,1\vert \mathbf{16} + \overline{\mathbf{16}}}_{res}$

is a [[resolution]] of type IIA [[super-Minkowski spacetime]].

in that there is a weak equivalence

By the discussion at _[[∞-action]]_ this exhibits a $b^{p}\mathbb{R}$-action on $b^{2p+2}\mathbb{R}$, for which $b^{2p+2} \mathbb{R}/b^{p}\mathbb{R}$ is the [[homotopy quotient]], whence the notation.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

That the diagram exists and commutes at the level of the underlying graded algebras of the [[formal dual]] CE-algebras is immediate in terms of the defining generators: each generator is mapped to the generator of the same name, if present, in the codomain, or to zero otherwise, except for $g_7 \in CE(b^6 \mathbb{R})$ which is sent to $h_3 \wedge \mu_4  + \frac{1}{15}\mu_7$ and $g_7 \in CE(b^6 \mathbb{R}/b^2 \mathbb{R})$, which is sent to $h_3 \wedge (g_4 + \mu_4) + \frac{1}{15}\mu_7 $, as indicated.

It remains to check that the middle horizontal map respects the CE-differentials: by prop. \ref{CocyclesOn11dSuperMinkowski} we have

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    d(h_3 \wedge (g_4 + \mu_4) + \frac{1}{15}\mu_7)
    &=
    (g_4 - \mu_4) \wedge (g_4 + \mu_4) + \mu_4 \wedge \mu_4
    \\
    & = g_4 \wedge g_4
  \end{aligned}
$$

and by def. \ref{RationalSphereAlgebra} this says indeed that $g_7 \mapsto h_3 \wedge (g_4 + \mu_4) + \frac{1}{15}\mu_7$ respects the CE-differentials.

In the discussions in _[[geometry of physics -- WZW terms]]_ and _[[geometry of physics -- BPS charges]]_ we see that under [[Lie integration]] and globalization in [[higher Cartan geometry]], these elements encode the [[supergravity C-field]] and its [[electric-magnetic duality|magnetic dual]].

based on the observation that

the [[equations of motion]] of [[11-dimensional supergravity]]

for the [[supergravity C-field]] [[field strength]] $G_4$  say that

$$
  d G_7 + \tfrac{1}{2} G_4 \wedge G_4 = 0
$$

with $G_7 = \ast G_4$ the [[Hodge dual]]

and this is just the algebraic relation for the Sullivan model of the [[rational n-sphere|rational 4-sphere]].


$\,$

Notice that, unstably, the [[4-sphere]]

is just the space whose [[torsion subgroup|non-torsion]] [[homotopy groups]]

hence those that are visible in [[rational homotopy theory]]

are in degrees 2+2 and 5+2:

| k | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| $\phantom{AA}\pi_k(S^4)\phantom{AA}$ | $\phantom{AA}0\phantom{AA}$ | $\phantom{AA}0\phantom{AA}$ | $\phantom{AA}0\phantom{AA}$ | $\phantom{AA}\mathbb{Z}\phantom{AA}$ | $\phantom{AA}\mathbb{Z}/2\phantom{AA}$ | $\phantom{AA}\mathbb{Z}/2\phantom{AA}$ | $\phantom{AA}\mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}/{12}\phantom{AA}$ |

$\,$

But the correct non-rational lift of the $\mathfrak{l}(S^4)$-coefficients

will also have to be such that it somehow gives rise to [[twisted K-theory]]

under (double) dimensional reduction. This is still an **open problem**.

For further comments see the talk

$\,$

Now that we have found

the descended $L_\infty$-cocycles

for all super $p$-branes

in twisted cohomology, rationally,

we may analyze their behaviour under [[double dimensional reduction]]

and discover the super $L_\infty$-algebraic incarnation

of various [[dualities in string theory]].


$\,$









## Double dimensional reduction
 {#DoubleDimensionalReduction}

$\,$

Underlying most of the [[nLab:dualities in string theory]] is

the phenomenon of  **[[nLab:double dimensional reduction]]**

so called because:

1. the [[nLab:dimension]] of [[nLab:spacetimes]] is reduced

   by [[nLab:Kaluza-Klein compactification]] on a [[nLab:fiber]] $F$;

1. in parallel the [[nLab:dimension]] of [[nLab:branes]] is reduced

   if they _[[nLab:wrapped brane|wrap]]_ $F$.


$\,$

For example [[nLab:double dimensional reduction]] is supposed to underly

the [[nLab:duality in string theory|duality]] between [[nLab:M-theory]] and [[nLab:type IIA string theory]]:

* [[nLab:spacetime]] $X_{11}$ is an 11d [[nLab:circle]]-[[nLab:fiber bundle]]

  locally of the form $X_{11} =  X_{10} \times S^1$

  over a 10d base spacetime;

* an [[nLab:M-theory]] [[nLab:membrane]] ([[nLab:M2-brane]]) with [[nLab:cylinder|cyclindrical]] [[nLab:worldvolume]]

  $$
    \Sigma_3 = \Sigma_2 \times S^1
  $$

  [[nLab:wrapped brane|wraps]] the circle fiber if its [[nLab:trajectory]]

  $$
    \phi_{M2} \;\colon\; \Sigma_3 \longrightarrow X_{11}
  $$

  is of the form

  $$
    \phi_{F1} \times \mathrm{id}_{S^1}
    \;\colon\;
    \Sigma_2 \times S^1 \longrightarrow X_{10} \times S^1
    \,.
  $$

As the [[nLab:pseudo-Riemannian metric|Riemannian]] circumference of the circle fiber $S^1$ tends towards zero

this effectively looks like the 2-dimensional [[nLab:worldsheet]] $\Sigma_2$ of a [[nLab:string]]

tracing out a [[nLab:trajectory]] in 10-dimensional spacetime:

$$
  \phi_{F1} \;\colon\; \Sigma_2 \longrightarrow X_{10}
$$

$\,$

But there is also "single dimensional reduction"

when the [[nLab:membrane]] does not [[nLab:wrapped brane|wrap]] the fiber space:

$$
  \array{
    \Sigma_3 &&  \overset{\phi_{M2}}{\longrightarrow} && X_{11}
    \\
    & {}_{\phi_{D2}}\searrow && \nearrow
    \\
    && X_{10}
  }
$$

In this case it looks like a [[nLab:membrane]] in 10d [[nLab:spacetime]],

now called the _[[nLab:D2-brane]]_.

$\,$

Similarly the [[nLab:M5-brane]] in [[nLab:M-theory]]

$$
  \phi_{M5} \;\colon\; \Sigma_{6} \longrightarrow X_{11}
$$

may [[nLab:wrapped brane|wrap]] the [[nLab:circle]] [[nLab:fiber]]

to yield a 4-brane in 10d, called the [[nLab:D4-brane]]

or it may not [[nLab:wrapped brane|wrap]] the [[nLab:circle]] [[nLab:fiber]]

to yield a 5-brane in 10d, called the [[nLab:NS5-brane]].

$\,$

Beware the naive treatment of branes in this traditional argument.

And even naively, this is not the full story yet:

The $S^1$-fibration itself is supposed to re-incarnate in 10d

as the [[nLab:D0-brane]] and the [[nLab:D6-brane]].

$\,$

Hence [[nLab:double dimensional reduction]] from [[nLab:M-theory]] to [[nLab:type IIA string theory]]

is meant to, schematically, involve decompositions as follows

$$
  \underset{spacetime}{
  \underbrace{
  \array{
    X_{11}
    \\
    \downarrow^{\pi}
    \\
    X_{10}
  }
  }
  }
  \;\;
  \underset{branes}{
  \underbrace{
  \array{
    && && \text{M2-brane} && && && \text{M5-brane}
    \\
    &&
    & {}^{\mathllap{wrapped}}\swarrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{not \atop wrapped}} &
    &
    &&
    {}^{\mathllap{wrapped}}\swarrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{not \atop wrapped}}
    \\
    \text{D0-brane} && \text{F1-brane} && &&  \text{D2-brane} && \text{D4-brane} && && \text{NS5-brane}
  }
  }
  }
$$



$\,$

Above we saw that all [[nLab:super p-branes]] are

characterized by the [[nLab:flux]] fields $H_{p+2}$ that they are charged under,

more precisely by the bispinorial component of $H_{p+2}$

which is constrained to be super-tangent-space-wise the form

$$
  H_{p+2}^{fermionic}
    \;=\;
  \tfrac{i^{p(p-1)/2}}{p!} \, \left( \overline{\Psi} \wedge \Gamma_{a_1 \cdots a_p}\Psi \right) \wedge E^{a_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge E^{a_p}
$$

where $(E^a, \Psi^\alpha)$ is the [[nLab:super vielbein]] ([[nLab:graviton]] and [[nLab:gravitino]]).

$\,$

$\,$

Hence we will formalize [[nLab:double dimensional reduction]] in terms of these [[nLab:fields]].

$\,$

Again there is a naive picture to help the intuition:

Let $G_4 \in \Omega^4_{cl}(X_{11})$ be the [[nLab:differential form|differential 4-form]] flux [[nLab:field strength]]  of the [[nLab:supergravity C-field]].


Under the [[nLab:Gysin sequence]] for the [[nLab:spherical fibration]]

$$
  \array{
    S^1 &\hookrightarrow& X_{11}
    \\
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\pi}}
    \\
    && X_{10}
  }
$$

this decomposes in cohomology as

$$
  G_4 = (d x^{10}) \wedge H_3 + \pi^\ast F_4
$$

thus giving rise in 10d to

1. a 3-form $H_3$, the [[nLab:Kalb-Ramond field|Kalb-Ramond]] [[nLab:B-field]] [[nLab:field strength]] that the [[nLab:string]] couples to;

1. a 4-form $F_4$, the [[nLab:RR-field]] [[nLab:field strength]] in degree 4, that the [[nLab:D2-brane]] couples to.

Similary the 7-form field strength $G_7$ decomposes as

$$
  G_7 = (d x^{10}) \wedge F_6 + \pi^\ast H_7
$$

thus giving rise in 10d to

1. a 6-form $F_6$, the [[nLab:RR-field]] [[nLab:field strength]] in degree 6, that the [[nLab:D4-brane]] couples to

1. a 7-form $H_7$, the dual NS-NS field strength that the [[nLab:NS5-brane]] couples to.


$$
  \underset{spacetime}{
  \underbrace{
  \array{
    X_{11}
    \\
    \downarrow^{\pi}
    \\
    X_{10}
  }
  }
  }
  \;\;
  \underset{fluxes}{
  \underbrace{
  \array{
    && && G_4\text{-flux} && && && G_7\text{-flux}
    \\
    &&
    & {}^{\mathllap{wrapped}}\swarrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{not \atop wrapped}} &
    &
    &&
    {}^{\mathllap{wrapped}}\swarrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{not \atop wrapped}}
    \\
    F_2\text{-flux} && H_3\text{-flux} && &&  F_4\text{-flux} && F_6\text{-flux} && && H_7\text{-flux}
  }
  }
  }
$$

$\,$

The advantage of this perspective on [[nLab:double dimensional reduction]]

from the point of view of the [[nLab:background field|background flux fields]]

is that powerful tools from [[nLab:cohomology]] theory apply.

$\,$

To first approximation

background fluxes represent classes in [[nLab:ordinary cohomology]] (their [[nLab:charges]]).


There is a [[nLab:classifying space]] $B^n \mathbb{Z}$ for [[nLab:ordinary cohomology]]

$$
   H^n(X,\mathbb{Z})
     \;\;\;
     \simeq
     \;\;\;
  \left\{
    \array{
      \text{continuous functions}
      \\
      X \longrightarrow B^n \mathbb{Z}
    }
  \right\}_{/homotopy}
$$

(called an _[[nLab:Eilenberg-MacLane space]]_, often denoted $K(\mathbb{Z},n)$).

Hence the charge of $G_4$/$G_7$-flux, to first approximation, is represented by a classifying map

$$
  ([G_4], [G_7])
    \;\colon\;
  X_{11}
    \longrightarrow
  B^4 \mathbb{Z} \,\times\, B^7 \mathbb{Z}
  \,.
$$

and we saw that under [[nLab:double dimensional reduction]]

this is supposed to transmute into a map of the form

$$
  ([F_2] , [H_3], [F_4], [F_6], [H_7])
    \;\colon\;
  X_{10}
    \longrightarrow
  B^2 \mathbb{Z} \;\times\; B^3 \mathbb{Z} \;\times\; B^4 \mathbb{Z}  \;\times\; B^6 \mathbb{Z} \;\times\; B^7 \mathbb{Z}
  \,.
$$

$\,$

**Which mathematical operation could cause such a transmutation?**

We will now find such an operation

and then use it to give an improved definition of [[nLab:double dimensional reduction]],

one that knows about all the fine print of brane charges.


$\,$

### Via free looping (no 0-brane effect)

$\,$

Let's first record formally

what was going on in the above story.

$\,$

In the above [[nLab:double dimensional reduction]]

of the naive M-fluxes on a trivial 11d circle bundle

we used

1. the [[nLab:Cartesian product]] with the circle

1. [[nLab:functions]] out of the circle.

Let's have a closer look at these two operations:

$\,$

It is a classical fact about [[nLab:locally compact topological spaces]]

(which includes all [[nLab:topological spaces]] that one cares about in [[nLab:physics]])

that

given topological spaces $\Sigma$, $X$ and $F$, then there is a [[nLab:natural bijection]]

$$
  \left\{
    \array{
      \text{continuous functions}
      \\
      \Sigma \times F \longrightarrow X
    }
  \right\}
   \;\;
     \underoverset
       {\text{"forming adjuncts"}}
       {\simeq}
       {\leftrightarrow}
   \;\;
  \left\{
    \array{
      \text{continous functions}
      \\
      \Sigma \longrightarrow Maps(F,X)
    }
  \right\}
$$

where

* $F \times X$ is the [[nLab:product topological space]] of $F$ with $X$

  (the set of pairs of points euipped with the [[nLab:product topology]])

* $Maps(F,Y)$ is the [[nLab:mapping space]] from $F$ to $X$,

  (the set of [[nLab:continuous functions]]) $F \to X$ equipped with the [[nLab:compact-open topology]])

Except for the subtlety with the topology

this bijection is just rewriting

a [[nLab:function]] of two [[nLab:variables]] as a function with values in a second function

$$
  (\tilde f(a))(b) = f(a,b)
  \,.
$$


$\,$

One says that the two [[nLab:functors]]

$$
  Top_{cg}
  \;
    \underoverset
      {\underset{Maps(F,-)}{\longrightarrow}}
      {\overset{F \times (-)}{\longleftarrow}}
      {\bot}
  \;
  Top_{cg}
$$

form a _[[nLab:adjoint functor|adjoint pair]]_ or an _[[nLab:adjunction]]_.

$\,$

$\,$

A remarkable amount of structure comes with every [[nLab:adjunction]]:

* the [[nLab:adjunct]] of the [[nLab:identity]] $F \times X \overset{id}{\to} F \times X$

  generally called the _[[nLab:unit of an adjunction|unit of the adjunction]]_,

  here is the **wrapping operation**

  $$
    X \overset{}{\longrightarrow} Maps(F, F \times X)
  $$

* the [[nLab:adjunct]] of the [[nLab:identity]] $Maps(F,X) \overset{id}{\to} Maps(F,X)$

  generally called the _[[nLab:counit of an adjunction|counit of the adjunction]]_,

  here is the [[nLab:evaluation map]]

  $$
    F \times Maps(F, X) \overset{ev}{\longrightarrow} X
  $$

  that evaluates a function on an argument

$\,$

We will see now that the following general fact

about [[nLab:adjoint functors]]

serves to implement the above physics story

of [[nLab:wrapped branes]]:

$\,$

**Fact.**

The [[nLab:adjunct]] of a map of the form

$$
  G \;\colon\; F \times X \overset{}{\longrightarrow} A
$$

is the composite of its image under $Maps(F,-)$ with the adjunction unit $\eta_X$:

$$
  \tilde G
    \;\colon\;
  X \overset{\eta_X}{\longrightarrow} Maps(F,F \times X)
    \overset{Maps(F,G)}{\longrightarrow}
  Maps(F,A)
$$


$\,$

Moreover, we will see that the following generall fact in [[nLab:homotopy theory]]

accurately implements the idea of dimensional reduction of the brane dimensions:

$\,$

For $F = S^1$ the [[nLab:circle]], then

$$
  \mathcal{L} X
  \;\coloneqq\;
  Maps(S^1, X)
$$

is also called the [[nLab:free loop space]] of $X$.

$\,$

+-- {: .num_prop #FreeLoopSpacesOfDeloopedAbelianInfinityGroups}
###### Proposition


For $G$ a general [[nLab:topological group]], then its [[nLab:free loop space]]

$$
  Maps(S^1, B G)
   \;\simeq\;
  G/_{ad}G
$$

is [[nLab:weak homotopy equivalence|weakly homotopy equivalent]] to the

[[nLab:homotopy quotient]] of $G$ by its [[nLab:adjoint action]].

In the special case that $G$ is an [[nLab:abelian group|abelian]] [[nLab:topological group]].

then this becomes a [[nLab:weak homotopy equivalence]] of following simple form

$$
  Maps(S^1 , B G)
    \; \simeq \;
  \underset{\text{wrapped} \atop \text{coefficient}}{\underbrace{G}}
    \; \times \;
  \underset{\text{plain} \atop \text{coefficient}  }{\underbrace{ B G }}
  \,.
$$


*This captures the required reduction on brane dimension!*

$\,$

In particular if $G = B^n \mathbb{Z}$ then

$$
  Maps(S^1, B^{n+1} \mathbb{Z}) \;\;  \simeq B^n \mathbb{Z} \;\times\; B^{n+1} \mathbb{Z}
  \,.

###### Example

Consider naive $M$-flux fields $G_4$ and $G_7$

on an 11d spacetime that is a trivial circle bundle $X_{11} = X_{10} \times S^1$.

Its charges is represented by a map of the form


$$
  ([G_4], [G_7])
    \;\colon\;
  X_{10} \times S^1 \longrightarrow B^4 \mathbb{Z} \times B^7 \mathbb{Z}
  \,.
$$

By [[nLab:adjunction]] this is identified with a map of the form

$$
  \left([H_3], [F_4], [F_6], [H_7]\right)
  \,\coloneqq\,
  \widetilde{([G_4], [G_7])}
    \;\colon\;
  X_{10}
    \longrightarrow
  Maps\left(
    S^1,
    \; B^4 \mathbb{Z} \times B^7 \mathbb{Z}  \;
  \right)
   \;\;\simeq\;\;
  B^3 \mathbb{Z}
    \;\times\;
  B^4 \mathbb{Z}
    \;\times\;
  B^6 \mathbb{Z}
    \;\times\;
  B^7 \mathbb{Z}
  \,.
$$

where on the right we have the transmuted [[nLab:coefficients]] by prop. \ref{FreeLoopSpacesOfDeloopedAbelianInfinityGroups}

=--

This is exactly the result we were after.

$\,$

Better yet, the [[nLab:adjunction]] yoga

accurately reflects the physics story:

For consider a $p$-brane propagating in 10d spacetimes along a [[nLab:trajectory]]

$$
  \phi_p \;\colon\; \Sigma_p \longrightarrow X_{10}
$$

and coupled to these dimensionally reduced background fields

$$
 \Sigma_p
   \overset{\phi_p}{\longrightarrow}
 X_{10}
   \overset{([H_3], [F_4], [F_6], [H_7])}{\longrightarrow}
 B^3 \mathbb{Z} \;\times\; B^4 \mathbb{Z} \;\times\; B^6 \mathbb{Z} \;\times\; B^7 \mathbb{Z}
 \;\;\;\simeq\;\;\;
 Maps(S^1, B^4 \mathbb{Z} \,\times\, B^7 \mathbb{Z})
 \,.
$$

By [[nLab:adjunction]] this is identified with a map of the form

$$
  \Sigma_p \times S^1
    \overset{\phi_p \times S^1}{\longrightarrow}
  X_{10} \times S^1 = X_{11}
    \overset{([G_4], [G_7])}{\longrightarrow}
  B^4 \mathbb{Z} \;\times\; B^7 \mathbb{Z}
$$

and this is exactly the coupling we saw in the story of double dimensional reduction.



$\,$

So this works well as far as it goes, but

so far it only applies to trivial circle fibrations

and it does not see the D0-charge.


$\,$

We now disucss the improvement to the full formulation.

$\,$

$\,$


### Via cyclification (with 0-brane effects)
 {#DoubleDimensionalReductionViaCyclification}

In general the M-theory circle bundle

$$
  \array{
    S^1 &\hookrightarrow& X_{11}
    \\
    && \downarrow
    \\
    && X_{10}
  }
$$

is only locally a product with of $X_{10}$ with $S^1$.

$\,$

For example

the complement of the locus of a **[[nLab:KK-monopole]]** [[nLab:spacetime]]

is a [[nLab:circle]] [[nLab:principal bundle]] with [[nLab:first Chern class]]

equal to the [[nlab:charge]] carried by the [[nLab:KK-monopole]].

(which is the corresponding number of coincident [[nLab:D6-branes]] in type IIA).

$\,$


Hence in general the above formulation of [[nLab:double dimensional reduction]]

via the pair of [[nLab:adjoint functors]]

$$
  S^1 \times (-) \;\;\dashv\;\; Maps(S^1, -)
$$

works only locally.

$\,$

But the problem to be solved is easily identified:

Essentially by definition, in a [[nLab:circle]] [[nLab:principal bundle]]

the [[nLab:fibers]] may all be identified with a fixed abstract [[nLab:circle]] $S^1$

only _up to rigid rotation_.

$\,$


Hence while in general the above wrapping-map

$$
  X_{10} \overset{}{\longrightarrow} Maps(S^1, X_{11})
$$

given by sending each point of $X_{10}$ to its fiber "wrapping around itself"

does not exist, it does exist up to forgetting at which point in $S^1$ we start the wrapping,

hence the map that always exists lands in the [[nlab:quotient space]]

$$
  Maps(S^1, X_{11})/S^1
  \;=\;
  \frac{
    \left\{
      \array{
        \text{continuous functions}
        \\
        S^1 \longrightarrow X_{11}
      }
    \right\}
  }{
    \left\{
      \array{
        \text{rigid loop rotations}
        \\
        S^1 \overset{t \mapsto (t + t_0)}{\longrightarrow} S^1
      }
    \right\}
  }
$$

In general we take this to be the [[nLab:homotopy quotient]] space.


$\,$

There is then the following generalization of proposition \ref{FreeLoopSpacesOfDeloopedAbelianInfinityGroups} on

transmutation of [[nLab:coefficients]] under [[nLab:double dimensional reduction]]



+-- {: .num_prop #FreeLoopSpacesModS1OfDeloopedAbelianInfinityGroups}
###### Proposition

Let $G$ be an [[nLab:abelian group|abelian]] [[nLab:topological group]].

Then there is a [[nLab:weak homotopy equivalence]] of the form

$$
  Maps(S^1 , B G)/S^1
    \; \simeq \;
  \left(
    \underset{wrapped \atop coefficient}{\underbrace{G}}
      \times
    \underset{plain \atop coefficient}{\underbrace{B G}}
  \right)

  \underbrace{

  }
  \underset{\text{D0-brane} \atop coeff.}{\underbrace{E S^1}}

=--

$\,$

Notice that a twisting appears. This is a general phenomenon.

We will see [below](#KKReductionToIIA) that for the example of reduction of M-flux

the twist that appears is that in the twisted de Rham cohomology  $d F_4 = H_3 \wedge F_2$

which connects RR-fields $F_{2p}$ with the H-flux $H_3$.

situation:

There is a pair of [[nLab:adjoint functors]] ([[nLab:adjoint (∞,1)-functors]] really)

$$
  \array{
    \left\{
      spaces
    \right\}
    &
      \underoverset
        {\underset{Maps(S^1,-)/S^1}{\longrightarrow}}

      \text{spaces over}\, B S^1

$$

(a prove in more generality is below after prop. \ref{GeneralReduction}).

Equivalently (by [Nikolaus-Schreiber-Stevenson 12](#NSS12)):

There is a pair of [[nLab:adjoint functors]] ([[nLab:adjoint (∞,1)-functors]] really)

$$
  \array{
    \left\{
      spaces

        {\bot}
    &
    \left\{
      S^1\text{-principal}\;\infty\text{-bundles}
    \right\}
  }
$$

Hence for

$$
  \array{
    S^1 &\hookrightarrow& X_{d+1}
    \\
    && \downarrow
    \\
    && X_{d}
  }
$$


an $S^1$-principal bundle and $A$ some [[nLab:coefficients]],

then there is a [[nLab:natural equivalence]]

$$
  \underset{
    \text{original} \atop \text{fluxes}
  }{
  \underbrace{
    Hom(X_{d+1}\;,\; A)

    Hom_{/B S^1}( X_{d} \; ,\; (\mathcal{L} A)/S^1 )
  }

Accordingly we have the following generalization of example \ref{ReductionOfGFluxChargesOnTrivialCircleFibration} to the case with possibly  non-trivial circle-fibration and non-trivial D0-flux:

###### Example

Consider naive $M$-flux fields $G_4$ and $G_7$ on an 11d [[nLab:spacetime]] that

is an $S^1$-[[nLab:principal bundle]]

$$
  \array{
    S^1 &\hookrightarrow& X_{11}
    \\
    && \downarrow
    \\
    && X_{10}
  }
$$


Its charges is represented by a map of the form


$$
  ([G_4], [G_7])
    \;\colon\;
  X_{11} \longrightarrow B^4 \mathbb{Z} \;\times\; B^7 \mathbb{Z}
  \,.
$$

By [[nLab:adjunction]] this is identified with a map of the form

$$
  \left([F_2], [H_3], [F_4], [F_6], [H_7]\right)
  \,\coloneqq\,
  \widetilde{([G_4], [G_7])}
    \;\colon\;
  X_{10}
    \longrightarrow
  Maps\left(
    S^1,
    \; B^4 \mathbb{Z} \times B^7 \mathbb{Z}  \;
  \right)
   \;\simeq\;
  E S^1
    \;\times_{S^1}\;
  \left(
    B^3 \mathbb{Z}
      \;\times\;
    B^4 \mathbb{Z}
      \;\times\;
    B^6 \mathbb{Z}
      \;\times\;
    B^7 \mathbb{Z}
  \right)
  \,.
$$

where on the right we transmuted the [[nLab:coefficients]] by prop. \ref{FreeLoopSpacesModS1OfDeloopedAbelianInfinityGroups}

$\,$

Hence the [[nLab:D0-brane]] charge appears! It is the [[nLab:first Chern class]]
of the M-theory circle bundle.

**Conclusion**

The double dimensional reduction of any flux field

$$
  X_{d+1}
    \overset{G}{\longrightarrow}
  A
$$

is

$$
  \array{
    X_{d}
      && \overset{\tilde G}{\longrightarrow} &&
    Maps(S^1, A)/S^1
    \\
    & \searrow && \swarrow
    \\
    && B S^1
  }
  \,.
$$


$\,$

The operation

$$
  \mathcal{L}(-)/S^1
  \;\coloneqq\;
  Maps(S^1, -)/S^1
$$

may be called **cyclification**

because the [[nLab:cohomology]] of this quotient of the [[nLab:free loop space]]

is **[[nLab:cyclic cohomology]]**.

$\,$

Shadows of this construction appear prominently also at other places in [[nLab:string theory]]

notably in discussion of the **[[nLab:Witten genus]]**.

A closely related concept in mathematics involving this is the **[[nLab:transchromatic character]] map**.



$\,$

In fact this formalization of [[nLab:double dimensional reduction]]

works with loads of further data taken into account, such as the

[[nLab:differential geometry]] of [[nLab:spacetimes]] and the [[nLab:differential cohomology]] of
flux fields.

$\,$


For the [[nLab:homotopy theory]] cognoscenti, here is the fully general statement:


+-- {: .num_prop #GeneralReduction}
###### Proposition

Let $\mathbf{H}$ be any  [[nLab:(∞,1)-topos]] such as

* the [[nLab:classical model structure on topological spaces|classical homotopy theory on topological spaces]]  as above

* or better the [[nLab:homotopy theory]] of [[nLab:super formal smooth infinity-groupoid|supergeometric homotopy types]]

and let $G$ be an [[nLab:∞-group]] in $\mathbf{H}$ such as

* a [[nLab:topological group]] as above

* or better [[nLab:Lie group]] such as the smooth [[nLab:circle group]] $S^1 \simeq U(1)$

then there is a pair of [[nLab:adjoint ∞-functors]] of the form

$$
  \mathbf{H}
    \underoverset
      {\underset{[G,-]/G}{\longrightarrow}}
      {\overset{hofib}{\longleftarrow}}
      {\bot}
  \mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}G}
  \,,
$$


where

* $[G,-]$ denotes the [[nLab:internal hom]] in $\mathbf{H}$,

* $[G,-]/G$ denotes the [[nLab:homotopy quotient]] by the [[nLab:conjugation action|conjugation]]
[[nLab:∞-action]] for $G$ equipped with its canonical [[nLab:∞-action]] by left multiplication and the argument
regarded as equipped with its trivial $G$-$\infty$-action.

Hence for

* $\hat X \to X$ a $G$ [[nLab:principal ∞-bundle]]

* $A$ a [[nLab:coefficient]] object, such as for some [[nLab:differential cohomology|differential]] [[nLab:generalized cohomology theory]]

then there is a [[nLab:natural equivalence]]

       \\
       && \mathbf{B}G
    }
  \right)
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof #DimensionalReductionAbstractly}
###### Proof


First observe that the [[nLab:conjugation action]] on $[G,X]$ is the [[nLab:internal hom]] in
the [[nLab:(∞,1)-category]] of $G$-[[nLab:∞-actions]] $Act_G(\mathbf{H})$.
Under the [[nLab:equivalence of (∞,1)-categories]]

$$
  Act_G(\mathbf{H}) \simeq \mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}G}
$$

(from [Nikolaus-Schreiber-Stevenson 12](#NSS12)) then $G$ with its canonical [[nLab:∞-action]] is $(\ast \to \mathbf{B}G)$
and $X$ with the trivial action is $(X \times \mathbf{B}G \to \mathbf{B}G)$.

Hence

$$
  [G,X]/G
    \simeq
  [\ast, X \times \mathbf{B}G]_{\mathbf{B}G}
  \;\;\;\;\;
  \in
   \mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}G}
  \,.
$$

Actually, this is the very definition of what $[G,X]/G \in \mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}G}$ is to mean in the first place, abstractly.

But now since the [[nLab:slice (∞,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}G}$ is itself cartesian closed, via

$$
  E \times_{\mathbf{B}G}(-)
  \;\;\;
   \dashv
  \;\;\;
  [E,-]_{\mathbf{B}G}
$$

it is immediate that
there is the following sequence of [[nLab:natural equivalences]]

$$
  \begin{aligned}
   \mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}G}(Y, [G,X]/G)
   & \simeq
   \mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}G}(Y, [\ast, X \times \mathbf{B}G]_{\mathbf{B}G})
   \\
   & \simeq
   \mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}G}(
     Y \times_{\mathbf{B}G} \ast,
     \underset{p^\ast X}{\underbrace{X \times \mathbf{B}G }}
  )
  \\
  & \simeq
  \mathbf{H}(
     \underset{hofib(Y)}{\underbrace{p_!(Y \times_{\mathbf{B}G} \ast)}},
     X
  )
  \\
  & \simeq
  \mathbf{H}(hofib(Y),X)
  \end{aligned}
$$

Here $p \colon \mathbf{B}G \to \ast$ denotes the terminal morphism and $p_! \dashv p^\ast$
denotes the [[nLab:base change]] along it.

$\,$

We now apply this general mechanism to the [[schreiber:brane bouquet]].

$\,$


### On super $p$-brane cocycles


$\,$

By the discussion of [[nLab:rational homotopy theory]] [above](#RationalHomotopyTheory)

we may think of [[nLab:L-∞ algebras]] as [[nLab:rational topological spaces]]

and more generally as rational [[nLab:parameterized spectra]].

For instance [above](#RRFields) we found that the [[nLab:coefficient]] space

for [[nLab:RR-fields]] in rational [[nLab:twisted K-theory]] is the

[[nLab:L-∞ algebra]] $\mathfrak{l}(KU/BU(1))$.

$\,$

Hence in order to apply [[nLab:double dimensional reduction]]

to [[nLab:super p-branes]]

we now specialize the above formalization to

 **cyclification of [[nLab:super L-∞ algebras]]** ([FSS 16b](#FSS16b))

$\,$


+-- {: .num_defn #Cyclification}
###### Definition

For $\mathfrak{g}$ any [[nlab:super L-∞ algebra]] of [[nLab:finite type]], its **cyclification**

$$
  \mathfrak{L}\mathfrak{g}/\mathbb{R}
  \in
  s L_\infty Alg_{\mathbb{R}}
$$

is defined by having [[nLab:Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] of the form

$$
  CE(\mathfrak{L}\mathfrak{g}/\mathbb{R})
  \coloneqq
  \left(
    \wedge^\bullet
      \left(
        \underset{\text{original}}{\underbrace{\mathfrak{g}^\ast}}
        \oplus
         \underset{\text{shifted copy}}{\underbrace{s\mathfrak{g}^\ast}}
          \oplus
         \underset{\text{new generator} \atop \text{in degree 2}}{\underbrace{\langle \omega_2 \rangle}}
      \right)
      \;,\;
  d_{\mathfrak{d}\mathfrak{g}/\mathbb{R}}
  \;\colon\;
  \left\{
    \array{
      \omega_2 &\mapsto& 0
      \\
      \alpha &\mapsto& d_{\mathfrak{g}} \alpha + \omega_2 \wedge s \alpha
      \\
      s \alpha &\mapsto&  - s d_{\mathfrak{g}} \alpha
    }
  \right.
  \right)
$$

where

$$
  s \mathfrak{g}^\ast
$$

is a copy of $\mathfrak{g}^\ast$ with cohomological degrees shifted _down_ by one, and where $\omega$ is a new generator in degree 2.

The differential is given for $\alpha \in \wedge^1 \mathfrak{g}^\ast$ by


$$
  d_{\mathfrak{d}\mathfrak{g}/\mathbb{R}}
  \;\colon\;
  \left\{
    \array{
      \omega_2 &\mapsto& 0
      \\
      \alpha &\mapsto& d_{\mathfrak{g}} \alpha \pm \omega_2 \wedge s \alpha
      \\
      s \alpha &\mapsto&  - s d_{\mathfrak{g}} \alpha
    }
  \right.
$$

where on the right we are extendng $s$ as a graded derivation.

Define

$$
  \mathfrak{L}\mathfrak{g}
  \in
  s L_\infty Alg_{\mathbb{R}}
$$

in the same way, but with $\omega_2 \coloneqq 0$.

=--


For every $\mathfrak{g}$ there is a [[nLab:homotopy fiber sequence]]

$$
  \array{
     && \mathfrak{L}\mathfrak{g}
     \\
     && \downarrow
     \\
     && \mathfrak{L} \mathfrak{g}/\mathbb{R}
     \\
     & \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\omega_2}}
     \\
     B \mathbb{R}
  }
$$

which hence exhibits $\mathfrak{L} \mathfrak{g}/\mathbb{R}$ as the [[nLab:homotopy quotient]]
of $\mathfrak{L}\mathfrak{g}$ by an $\mathbb{R}$-action.


$\,$

The following says that the $L_\infty$-cyclification from prop.  \ref{Cyclification}

indeed does model correspond to the topological cyclification from prop. \ref{CorrectReductionOnTopologicalSpaces}.

If

$$
  \mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{l}(X)
$$

is the $L_\infty$-algebra associated by [[nLab:rational homotopy theory]]
to a  [[nLab:simply connected topological space]] $X$, then

$$
  \mathfrak{L}( \mathfrak{l}(X) )
    \simeq
  \mathfrak{l}( \mathcal{L}X )
$$

corresponds to the [[nLab:free loop space]] of $X$ and

$$
  \mathfrak{L}( \;\mathfrak{l}( X )\; )/\mathbb{R}
    \simeq
  \mathfrak{l}( \;\mathcal{L}X/S^1\; )
$$

corresponds to the [[nLab:homotopy quotient]] of the [[nLab:free loop space]] by the [[nLab:circle group]] [[nLab:action]] which rotates the loops.

The [[nLab:cochain cohomology]] of the [[nLab:Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]]

$$
  CE(\mathfrak{l}( \;\mathcal{L}X/S^1\; ))
$$

computes the [[nLab:cyclic cohomology]] of $X$ with [[nLab:coefficients]] in $\mathbb{R}$.

(Whence "cyclification".)

Moreover the homotopy fiber sequence of the cyclification corresponds to that of the [[nLab:free loop space]]:

$$

      \mathcal{L}X
      \\
      \downarrow^{\mathrlap{hofib(p)}}

The following gives the super-$L_\infty$-theoretic formalization

of "[[nLab:double dimensional reduction]]"

by which both the spacetime dimension is reduced

while at the same time the [[nLab:brane]] dimension

reduces (if [[nLab:wrapped brane|wrapping]] the reduced dimension).

$$

### M/IIA-Duality via Double dimensional reduction via Cyclification
 {#KKReductionToIIA}

$\,$

The [[nLab:M2-brane]]/[[nLab:M5-brane]] in 11d

is all controled by the following [[nLab:Fierz identities]]

for the $\mathbf{32}$ [[nLab:Majorana spinor|Majorana]] [[nLab:spin representation]] for $Spin(10,1)$

$\,$

   $$
     \left(
       \overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma_{a b} \psi
     \right)
     \wedge
     \left(
        \overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma^b \psi
     \right)
     \;= \; 0

and

         \wedge
         \Gamma_{a_1 \cdots a_4 b}

     \right)
     \wedge
     \left(
       \overline{\psi}
        \wedge
        \Gamma^{b}
        \psi

     \;=\;
     3
     \left(
     \overline{\psi}
        \Gamma_{[a_1 a_2}
     \psi
     \right)
     \wedge
     \left(
       \overline{\psi}
          \Gamma_{a_3 a_4]}
       \psi
     \right)
   $$

([D'Auria-Fré 82b (3.13) and (3.28) ](geometry+of+physics+--+supersymmetry#DAuriaFre82b))

$\,$

$\,$

The first [[nLab:Fierz identity]] says that

$$
  \mu_{M2}
  \:\coloneqq\;
  \left(
  \tfrac{i}{2}
  \overline{\psi}
     \wedge
     \Gamma_{a b}
  \psi
  \right)
  \wedge
    e^{a}
    \wedge
    e^b
$$

is a 4-cocycle on $\mathbb{R}^{10,1\vert \mathbf{32}}$, classifying the

[[nLab:supergravity Lie 3-algebra]] extension

$$
  \array{
    \mathfrak{m}2\mathfrak{brane}
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbb{R}^{10,1\vert \mathbf{32}}
  }
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  CE(\mathfrak{m}2\mathfrak{brane})
  =
  \left\{
    \array{
      d \, e^a = \overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma^a \psi
      \\
      d \, \psi^\alpha = 0
      \\
      d \, h_3 = \mu_{M2}
    }
  \right\}
$$

The second says that

$$
  \mu_{M5}
    \;\coloneqq\;
  \tfrac{1}{5!}
  \left(
    \overline{\psi}
      \wedge
      \Gamma_{a_1 \cdots a_5}
    \psi
  \right)
  \wedge
  e^{a_1}
    \wedge
    \cdots
    \wedge
  e^{a_5}
  \;-\;
  \tfrac{1}{2} h_3 \wedge \mu_{M2}
$$

is a 7-cocycle on $\mathfrak{m}2\mathfrak{brane}$

$$
  \mu_{M5}
  \;\colon\;
  \mathfrak{m}2\mathfrak{brane}
    \longrightarrow
  b^6 \mathbb{R}
$$

$\,$

Equivalently, (by the discussion at _[M-Flux fields](#MFluxFields)_ above)

with $\mathfrak{l}(S^4)$ the [[nLab:rational n-sphere|rational 4-sphere]]

$$
  CE(\mathfrak{l}(S^4))
   =
  \left\{
    \array{
      d \, g_4 = 0
      \\
      d \, g_7 = -\tfrac{1}{2} g_4 \wedge g_4
    }
  \right\}
$$


then the two [[nLab:Fierz identities]] together say that there is a single [[nLab:4-sphere]] valued cocycle

$$
  \mu_{M2/M5}
  \;\colon\;
  \mathbb{R}^{10,1\vert \mathbf{32}}
    \longrightarrow
  \mathfrak{l}(S^4)
$$


Hence $S^4$ is the rational coefficient for the unified M2/M5 M-flux fields.

Now we compute what becomes of this under [[nLab:double dimensional reduction]] via $L_\infty$-cyclification (prop. \ref{DimensionalReduction})

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

Let $X = S^4$ be the [[nLab:4-sphere]].

Its free loop algebra $\mathcal{L}S^4$ is given by

$$
 CE( \; \mathfrak{L}S^4 \; )
  \;=\;

    d\, \omega_6 & = h_3 \wedge \omega_4
    \\
    d\, h_7 & = -\tfrac{1}{2} \omega_4 \wedge \omega_4
    \\
  }
  \right\}
$$

and its cyclification $\mathcal{L}S^4 / S^1$ is given by

$$
  CE( \; \mathfrak{L}S^4 / \mathbb{R}  \; )
  \;=\;
  \left\{
    \array{
      d \, h_3 & = 0

###### Proposition
([Fiorenza-Sati-Schreiber 16a, section 3](#FSS16a))


The cyclification of the M-brane coefficient $\mathfrak{l}(S^4)$

is the truncated IIA F1/D-brane coefficient $\mathfrak{l}( KU\langle 0,6 \rangle ( B U(1) )$

with an extra twist for the [[nLab:NS5-brane]]:

$$
  CE\left(
    \mathfrak{L} S^4 / \mathbb{R}
  \right)
  \;\simeq\;
  CE\left(\,
     \underset{\text{F1/Dp-branes}}{\underbrace{
     \mathfrak{l}(KU\langle 0,6\rangle/B U(1))
     }}
     \,
  \right)
  \underset{\text{NS5-brane}}{\underbrace{
    [h_7]/(d h_7 = \omega_2 \wedge \omega_6 - \omega_4 \wedge \omega_4)
  }}
  \,.
$$


Under this identification

the $L_\infty$-theoretic dimensional reduction according to prop. \ref{DimensionalReduction}

of the unified M-brane cocycle $\mu_{M2/M5}$ of prop. \ref{MBraneDescent}

along the M-theory extension from example \ref{D0Cocycle}

is the unified type IIA F1/D-brane cocycle from prop. \ref{DescentOfIIACocycles}:

            =
            \atop

$\,$

Observe that (by [[nLab:adjunction]]) this [[nLab:double dimensional reduction]] operation

is an [[nLab:isomorphism]], hence

* the M2/M5-brane cocycle $\mathbb{R}^{10,1\vert \mathbf{32}} \longrightarrow \mathfrak{l}(S^4)$ in 11d

is equivalent to

* the F1/D$p$/NS5-brane cocycle $\mathbb{R}^{9,1 \vert \mathbf{16} + \overline{\mathbf{16}}} \longrightarrow \mathfrak{l}(\mathcal{L}S^4/S^1)$

Hence this is the M/IIA duality

on super $p$-brane super Lie $n$-algebra cocycles.



$\,$

### IIA/IIB-Duality via T-Duality
 {#TDuality}


The archetypical [[nLab:duality in string theory]] is _[[nLab:T-duality]]_, which relates the [[nLab:F1-brane|F1]]/[[nLab:D-brane|Dp]]/[[nLab:NS5-brane|NS5]]-[[nLab:super p-branes]] of [[nLab:type IIA string theory]] on a [[nLab:superspacetime]] which is a [[nLab:circle]] [[nLab:fiber bundle]] over a 9d base to those of [[nLab:type IIB string theory]] on a dual circle fibration with the fiber size inverted in string length units. The [[nLab:F1-brane|F1]]/[[nLab:D-brane|Dp]]-[[nLab:super p-brane]] charges on both sides of this [[nLab:duality in physics|duality]] take values in [[nLab:twisted K-theory]], and hence the mathematical statement here is that dual circle fibrations of this form induce an equivalence in [[nLab:twisted K-theory]]. This T-duality equivalence of F1/D$p$-brane charges in [[nLab:twisted K-theory]] is known in the literature as "[[nLab:topological T-duality]]".


$\,$


The IIA and the IIB spacetime both extend the single $N = 2$ 9d spacetime

$$
  \array{
    \mathbb{R}^{9,1\vert \mathbf{16} + \mathbf{16}}
      && &&
    \mathbb{R}^{9,1\vert \mathbf{16} + \overline{\mathbf{16}}}
    \\
    & \searrow && \swarrow
    \\
    && \mathbb{R}^{8,1\vert \mathbf{16} + \mathbf{16}}
  }
$$

Apply [[nLab:double dimensional reduction]] of the unified $F1/Dp$-cocycles

in IIA and IIB along both of these.

The resulting cyclified $L_\infty$-cocycles in 9d turn out to be $L_\infty$-equivalent.
