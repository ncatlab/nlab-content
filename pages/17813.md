#### Motivation and survey


The _[[Green-Schwarz action functional]]_ is an [[action functional]] for a [[sigma-model]] that describes the propagation of a fundamental $p$-[[brane]] $\Sigma$ on a [[supermanifold]] [[spacetime]].

* For $p = 0$ this is the **Green-Schwarz [[superparticle]]**.

* For $p = 1$ the **Green-Schwarz [[superstring]]** (at the center of attention in [[string theory]]). This model is in contrast to the _[[NSR-string]]_ model, which instead has manifest [[worldsheet]] [[supersymmetry]]. See at _[[superstring]]_ for more on this.


[[perturbation theory|Perturbative]] [[string theory]] on geometric backgrounds is defined by the [[Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond model]], namely by [[sigma-model]] [[2d super conformal field theories]] (of [[central charge]] 15) on [[worldsheets]] $\Sigma$ that are [[super Riemann surfaces]], with [[target spaces]] $X$ that are ordinary (i.e. "bosonic") [[spacetime]] [[manifolds]].

These worldsheet field theories are induced from _[[action functionals]]_, namely variants of the standard [[energy functional]] ([[Polyakov action]]) on the space $[\Sigma,X]$ of smooth functions

$$
  \phi \;\colon\; \Sigma \longrightarrow X
  \,.
$$

The central theorem of perturbative superstring theory says that the spectrum of such a 2d SCFT are the quanta of the [[perturbation theory|perturbations]] of a higher dimensional [[effective field theory|effective]] [[supergravity]] [[field theory]] on target spacetime, hence transforms under [[supersymmetry]] on target spacetime.

This is the fundamental prediction of the assumption of fundamental strings: assuming 1) that the particles that run in [[Feynman diagrams]] are fundamentally strings, and demanding 2) that there are fermionic particles among these, first implies that the strings must be [[spinning strings]] (have fermions on their worldsheet), which implies that they are [[superstrings]] (worldsheet [[supersymmetry]] mixes the worldsheet bosons and fermions), which then in addition implies that their target space [[effective field theory]] is [[supergravity]], hence that also the effective target space fields exhibit local supersymmetry.

$$
  \underset{spinning\; string}{\underbrace{fermions \;+\; strings}}
  \;=\;
  superstring \;\Rightarrow\; supergravity
  \,.
$$

The first step in this implications (spinning string is superstring) is straightforward, but the second step appears as a miracle from the point of view of the NSR string. It comes out this way by non-trivial computation, but is not manifest in the theory.

In order to improve on this situation, Green and Schwarz searched and found ([Green-Schwarz 81](#GreenSchwarz81), [Green-Schwarz 82](#GreenSchwarz82) [Green-Schwarz 84](#GreenSchwarz84), for the history see [Schwarz 16, slides 24-25](#Schwarz16)) a suitably equivalent string [[action functional]]  that would manifestly exhibit spacetime supersymmetry. This is now called the _[[Green-Schwarz action functional]]_.

| [[action functional]] for [[superstring]] | manifest [[supersymmetry]] |
|----|---|
| [[Ramond-Neveu-Schwarz string]] | on [[worldsheet]]  |
| Green-Schwarz string | on [[target space|target]] [[spacetime]] |

The basic idea is to pass to the evident [[supergeometry|supergeometric]] analogue of the bosonic string action:

Let $\Sigma$ be a [[closed manifold]] of [[dimension]] 2 -- representing the abstract _[[worldsheet]]_ of a string. Let $(X,g)$ be a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]] -- representing a purely [[gravity|gravitational]] [[spacetime]] background. Then the [[action functional]] governing the [[bosonic string]] propagating in this spacetime is the functional

$$
  \exp(\tfrac{i}{\hbar} S_{bos})
  \;\colon\;
  [\Sigma,X]
   \longrightarrow
  \mathbb{R}/_{\hbar}\mathbb{Z}
$$

on the [[smooth space|smooth]] [[mapping space]] $[\Sigma,X]$ of [[smooth functions]] $\Sigma \to X$, that simply assigns the proper relativistic [[volume]] of the image of the [[worldsheet]] $\Sigma$ in [[spacetime]]:

$$
  (\Sigma\overset{\phi}{\longrightarrow} X)
    \;\mapsto\;
  \int_\Sigma vol_{\phi^\ast g}
  \,.
$$

(This is the _[[Nambu-Goto action]]_. It is classically equivalently to the [[Polyakov action]] which is the genuine starting point for the quantum [[Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond string]]. Howver, since, as we discuss below, the Green-Schwarz action naturally generalizes to that of other $p$-[[branes]] it is more natural to consider the Nambu-Goto form of the action here.)

When here $(X,g)$ is generalized to a [[superspacetime]] [[supermanifold]] with [[orthogonal structure]] encoded by a [[super-vielbein]] $e$ (see at _[[super Cartan geometry]]_ for details), then the same form of the action functional still makes sense and produces a functional on the [[supergeometry|supergeometric]] [[mapping space]] $[\Sigma,X]$. Moreover, by construction this action functional is invariant under the [[superisometry group]] of $(X,g)$, hence under spacetime [[supersymmetry]].


$$
\array{
  \text{symmetry of worldsheet theory}
  \\
  \array{
    && \Sigma
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{\phi}}\swarrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{\phi'}}
    \\
    X &&\underset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}&& X
  }
  \\
  \text{super-isometry of target spacetime}
}
$$

However, Green and Schwarz noticed that this [[kinetic action]] functional $\phi \mapsto \int_\Sigma vol_{\phi^\ast e}$ does _not_ quite yield dynamics that is equivalent to that of the NSR string: when the [[equations of motion]] hold ("on shell") it has more fermionic degrees of freedom than present in the NSR string. The key insight of Green and Schwarz was that one may add an extra summand to the action functional to the plain super-Nambu-Goto action, such that the resulting functional enjoys a further 1-parameter symmetry, called _[[kappa-symmetry]]_,  and such that restricting to the $\kappa$-symmetric states, then the action functionals do become classically equivalent.

Moreover, they showed that in [[light-cone gauge]] the resulting quantum dynamics is equivalent to that of the [[NSR string]], thus providing a conceptual proof for the observed local spacetime supersymmetry for backgrounds that admit two lightlike Killing vectors. (The quantization of the GS-string away from lightcone gauge however remains an open problem.)


Green-Schwarz's extra [[kappa-symmetry]] term serves a clear purpose, but originally its geometrically meaning was mysterious. However, in ([Henneaux-Mezincescu 85](#HenneauxMezincescu85)) it was observed (expanded on in ([Rabin 87](#Rabin87), [Azcarraga-Townsend 89](#AzcarragaTownsend89), [Azcarraga-Izquierdo 95,chapter 8](#AzcarragaIzquierdo95))), that the Green-Schwarz-action functional describing the string in $d+1$-dimensions has a neat geometrical interpretation: it is simply the ([[parameterized WZW model|parameterized]]) [[WZW-model]] for

1. target space being locally [[super Minkowski spacetime]] $\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1|\mathbf{N}}$ regarded as the [[coset]] [[supergroup]]

   $$
     \mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert \mathbf{N}}
       \;\simeq\;
     Iso(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert \mathbf{N}}) / Spin(d-1,1)
   $$

   for $\mathbf{N}$ a real [[spin representation]] (the "number of supersymmetries"), $Iso(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert \mathbf{N}})$ the corresponding [[super Poincar√© group]] and $Spin(d-1,1)$ its [[Lorentzian manifold|Lorentz-signature]] [[spin group|Spin]] [[subgroup]];

1. [[WZW-term]] being a local potential for the the unique (up to rescaling, if it exists) $Spin(d-1,1)$-invariant [[group cocycle|group 3-cocycle]] $\mu_3$ on $Iso(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert \mathbf{N}})$, with component locally given by the Gamma-matrices of the given [[Clifford algebra]] representation.

More in detail, just as ordinary [[Minkowski spacetime]] $\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1}$ may be identified with the [[translation group]] with canonical basis of [[left invariant 1-forms]] given by the canonical [[vielbein]] field

$$
  \{e^a \coloneqq \mathbf{d}x^a\}_{a = 0}^{d-1}
  \,,
$$

where $\{x^a\}$ are the canonical [[coordinates]] on $\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1}$, so [[super Minkowski spacetime]] $\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert \mathbf{N}}$ for some real [[spin representation]] $\mathbf{N}$ is characterized as the [[supergroup]] whose [[left invariant 1-forms]] consitute the $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$-bigraded differential with generators the [[super-vielbein]]

$$
  \underset{deg = (1,even)}{\underbrace{e^a}}
    \;\coloneqq\;
  \mathbf{d}x^a + \tfrac{i}{2}\overline{\theta}\Gamma^a \mathbf{d} \theta
  \;\;\;\,,\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \underset{deg = (1,odd)}{\underbrace{\psi^\alpha}} \;\coloneqq\; \mathbf{d}\theta^\alpha
  \,,
$$

where $(x^a, \theta^\alpha)$ are the canonical coordinates on $\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert \mathbf{N}}$, with the odd-graded elements $\{\theta^\alpha\}$ spanning the given real [[spin representation|Spin(d-1,1)-representation]] $\mathbf{N}$ with [[Clifford algebra]] generators $\{\Gamma^a\}$.

Now while ordinary [[Minkowski spacetime]] $\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1}$ is an [[abelian group]], reflected by the fact that its [[left-invariant 1-forms]] are all closed

$$
  \mathbf{d}e^a = 0 \;\;\;\;\;\; on \; \mathbb{R}^{d-1,1}
  \,,
$$

the key phenomenon of [[supersymmetry]] (that two [[fermions]] pair to a [[bosons]]) means that $\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert \mathbf{N}}$ is slightly non-abelian, reflected by the fact that the [[super-vielbein]] is not closed

$$
  \mathbf{d} e^a = \tfrac{i}{2} \overline{\psi} \Gamma^a \psi
  \;\,,\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \mathbf{d} \psi^\alpha = 0
  \,.
$$

This is the source of all the rich structure seen in Green-Schwarz theory.

In particular, for special combinations of spacetime dimension $d$ and number of supersymmetries $\mathbf{N}$ the 3-form


$$
  \mu_3 \;\coloneqq\;  \overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma_a \psi \wedge e^a
$$

is a non-trivial [[super Lie algebra|super]] [[Lie algebra cocycle]] on $\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert \mathbf{N}}$, in that $\mathbf{d}\mu_3 = 0$ and so that there is no [[left invariant differential form]] $b$ with $\mathbf{d}b = \mu_3$.

This happens notably for $d = 10$ and $\mathbf{N} = (1,0)$ ([[heterotic string]]) or $\mathbf{N} = (2,0)$ ([[type IIB superstring]]) and $\mathbf{N} = (1,1)$ ([[type IIA superstring]]). (It also happens in some lower dimensions, where however the corresponding NSR-string develops a [[conformal anomaly]] after quantization ("non-critical strings"). This classification of cocycles is part of what has come to be known as the _[[brane scan]]_ in superstring theory, see below.)

In this equivalent formulation, the Green-Schwarz action functional for the superstring has the following simple form:

Let $(X,e)$ be a [[superspacetime]], hence a [[supermanifold]] $X$ equipped with a [[super-vielbein]] $e$ (super-[[orthogonal structure]]) which is locally modeled on $\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert \mathbf{N}}$ (technically: a [[torsion of a G-structure|torsion]]-free [[super-Cartan geometry]] modeled on $Spin(d-1,1) \hookrightarrow Iso(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert \mathbf{N}})$). Write $\mu_3^X \in \Omega^3(X)$ be the [[super differential form]] on $X$ which is the induced [[definite globalization of WZW term|definite globalization]] of the cocycle $\mu_3$ over $X$. For $U \subset X$ any contractible subspace, then the restriction of $\mu^X_3|_{U} \in \Omega^3(U)$ of $\mu_3^X$ to $U$ is exact, and hence admits a potential $B_U \in \Omega^2(U)$, i.e. such that $d B = \mu^X_3|_U$.

Then for $\Sigma$ a 2-dimensional [[closed manifold]], the Green-Schwarz action functional

$$
  \exp(\tfrac{i}{\hbar} S_{GS})
  \;\colon\;
  [\Sigma,X]_U
    \longrightarrow
  \mathbb{R}/_{\hbar} \mathbb{Z}
$$

is the function on the super-[[smooth space]] $[\Sigma,X]_U$ of smooth maps of supermanifolds $\phi \colon \Sigma \to X$ which factor through $U$, given by

$$
  \phi
    \;\mapsto\;
  \int_\Sigma vol_{\phi^\ast e}
   \;+\;
  \int_\Sigma \phi^\ast B_U
  \;\;\;\,,\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \mathbf{d} B_U = \mu^X_3|_U
  \,.
$$

In order to get rid of the restriction to some $U \subset X$ one needs to add global data. The need for this is at least mentioned briefly in ([Witten 86, p. 261 (17 of 20)](#Witten86)), but had otherwise been ignored in the physics literature. The general solution is to promote the local potentials $B$ to the connection $\hat B$ on a [[Super Gerbes|super gerbe]] ([Fiorenza-Sati-Schreiber 13](#FiorenzaSatiSchreiber13)). This is a choice of [[higher prequantization]]

$$
  \array{
    && \mathbf{B}^{2}(\mathbb{R}/_\hbar \mathbb{Z}) & \text{prequantization}
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{\hat B}}\nearrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{curv}}
    \\
    X
     &\underset{\mu^X_3}{\longrightarrow}&
    \mathbf{\Omega}^3
    &
    \text{3-form curvature}
  }
  \,.
$$


Writing $\int_\Sigma \phi^\ast \hat B$ for the [[volume holonomy]] of a [[circle 2-bundle with connection]] $\hat B$, then the globally defined Green-Schwarz sigma model

$$
  \exp(\tfrac{i}{\hbar} S_{GS})
  \;\colon\;
  [\Sigma, X]
    \longrightarrow
  \mathbb{R}/_\hbar\mathbb{Z}
$$

is given by

$$
  \phi \;\mapsto\; \int_\Sigma vol_{\phi^\ast} + \int_\Sigma \phi^\ast \hat B
  \;\;\,,
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  curv(\hat B) = \mu_3^X
  \,.
$$

This form of the Green-Schwarz action functional for the string has evident generalization to other $p$-[[branes]]. Whenever there is a Lorentz-invariant $(p+2)$-cocycle $\mu_{p+2}$ on $\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert \mathbf{N}}$, then one may ask for a higher gerbe ([[higher prequantum line bundle]]) $\hat C$ with [[curvature]] $\mu^X_{p+2}$ and consider the analogous functional.

The triples $(d,\mathbf{N},p)$ (spacetime dimension, number of supersymmetries, dimension of brane) such that

$$
  \mu_{p+2}
    \;\coloneqq\;
  \overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma^{a_1 \cdots a_p} \psi \wedge e_{a_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge e_{a_p}
$$

is a nontrivial cocycle, hence for which there is such a Green-Schwarz action functional for $p$-branes on $\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert \mathbf{N}}$ may be classified and form what is called the _[[brane scan]]_ ([Ach√∫carro-Evans-TownsendWiltshire 87](#AETW87), [Brandt 12-13](#Brandt12-13)):

The graphics on the left is from ([Duff 87](#Duff87)). The diagonal lines indicate [[double dimensional reduction]], taking a $(p+1)$-brane in $(d+1)$ dimensions to a $p$-brane in $d$-dimensions.

For instance for $(d = 11, \; \mathbf{N} = \mathbf{32}, \; p = 2)$ one finds a cocycle, and the corresponding GS-action functional is that of the fundamental [[M2-brane]].

This was a striking confluence of brane physics and classification of [[super Lie algebra|super]] [[Lie algebra cohomology]]. But just as striking as the matching, was what it lacked to match: the [[D-branes]] and the [[M5-brane]] ($d = 11$, $p = 5$) are lacking from the old brane scan. Incidentally, these lacking branes are precisely those branes on which the branes that do appear on the brane scan may end, equivalently those branes that have [[higher gauge fields]] on their [[worldvolume]] (tensor multiplets).

An action functional for the [[M5-brane]] vaguely analogous to a Green-Schwarz action functional was found in ([BLNPST 97](#BLNPST97), [APPS 97](#APPS97)). It is again the sum of a kinetic term and a WZW-like term, but the WZW-like term does not come from a cocycle on a (super-)group.

In order to deal with this, it was suggested in ([CAIB 99](#CAIB99), [Sakaguchi 00](#Sakaguchi00), [Azcarraga-Izquierdo 01](#AzcarragaIzquierdo01)) that there is an algebraic structure called "[[extended super-Minkowski spacetimes]]" that generalizes [[super Minkowski spacetime]] and serves to unify the Green-Schwarz-like models for the D-branes and the M5-brane with the original Green-Schwarz models for the string and the M2-brane.

These [[extended super-Minkowski spacetimes]] carry algebraic analogs of super Lie algebra cocycles, such that the relevant terms for the [[D-branes]] and the [[M5-brane]] do appear after all, hence such that all the branes in [[string theory]]/[[M-theory]] are unified. In fact these "[[extended super-Minkowski spacetimes]]" are precisely the "FDA"s that have been introduced before in the [[D'Auria-Fr√© formulation of supergravity]] and what became identified as the 7-cocycle for the [[M5-brane]] this way had earlier been recognized algebraically as an stepping stone for an elegant re-derivation of [[11-dimensional supergravity]] ([D'Auria-Fr√© 82](#DAuriaFre82)).

The ([[higher differential geometry|higher]]) geometric meaning of these constructions was found in ([Fiorenza-Sati-Schreiber 13](#FiorezaSatiSchreiber13)): these algebraic structures of "[[extended super-Minkowski spacetimes]]"/FDAs are precisely the [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebras]] of [[super Lie n-algebra]]-extensions of [[super-Minkowski spacetime]] which are classified by the cocycles that serve as the GS-WZW terms of the $p_1$-branes that may end on those $p_2$-branes whose cocycles are carried by the extended super-Minkowski spacetime.

Hence the missing $p$-branes in the old [[brane scan]] (classifying just cocycles on [[super Lie algebras]]) do appear as one generalizes (super) Lie algebras to (super) [[strong homotopy Lie algebras]] = [[L-infinity algebras]]. Moreover, each brane intersection law (one brane species may end on another) is now matched to a super $L_\infty$-algebra [[extension]] and so the old brane scan is generalized to a tree of branes _[[schreiber:The brane bouquet]]_:

<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12630719/BraneBouquet.JPG" alt="the brane bouquet" width="900" />

Each item in this bouquet denotes a [[super L-infinity algebra]] and each arrow denotes an [[L-infinity extension]] classified by a cocycle which encodes the GS-WZW term of the brane named by the domain of the arrow. Moreover, arrows pass exactly from one brane species to the brane species that may end on the former.

In ([Fiorenza-Sati-Schreiber 13](#FiorenzaSatiSchreiber13)) it is shown that all these [[super L-infinity algebras]] [[Lie integration|Lie integrate]] to [[smooth super-n-groups]], and all the cocycles [[Lie integration|Lie integrate]] to [[Super Gerbes|super-gerbes]] on these, such that the induced [[volume holonomy]] is the relevant generalized GS-WZW term. For detailed exposition see at _[[schreiber:Structure Theory for Higher WZW Terms]]_.

With this generalized perspective, now the Green-Schwarz-type action functionals describe _all_ the [[p-branes]] in [[string theory]]/[[M-theory]].

Again, in order to make this generally true one needs to apply a [[higher prequantization]] -- a choice of [[line n-bundle with connection|line (p+1)-bundle with connection]] -- in order to globalize the [[WZW-terms]] ([Fiorenza-Sati-Schreiber 13](#FiorenzaSatiSchreiber13))

$$
  \array{
    && \mathbf{B}^{p+1}(\mathbb{R}/_\hbar \mathbb{Z}) & \text{prequantization}
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{\hat A_{p+1}}}\nearrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{curv}}
    \\
    X
     &\underset{\mu^X_{p+2}}{\longrightarrow}&
    \mathbf{\Omega}^{p+2}
    &
    (p+2)\text{-form curvature}
  }
  \,.
$$

Hence $\hat A_{p+1}$ is the actual [[background field]] that the $p$-brane couples to. There is considerably more information in $\hat A_p$ than in its curvature $curv(\hat A_{p+1}) = \mu_{p+2}$. For instance for the [[M2-brane]] one may find the local super [[moduli space]] for local choices of $\hat A_{p+1}$ for the given $\mu_{4}$ on [[KK-compactifications]] to $d = 4$. It turns out that the bosonic [[body]] of this moduli space is the [[exceptional tangent bundle]] on which the [[U-duality]] group [[E7]] has a canonical action (see at _[[schreiber:From higher to exceptional geometry]]_).

This highlights that Green-Schwarz functionals capture fundamental ("microscopic") aspects of $p$-branes. In contrast, often $p$-branes are discussed in their [[soliton|solitonic]] incarnation as _[[black branes]]_. These solitonic branes sit at asymptotic boundaries of [[anti-de Sitter spacetime]] and carry [[conformal field theories]], related to the ambient [[supergravity]] by [[AdS-CFT duality]].

This phenomenon is indeed a consequence of the fundamental Green-Schwarz branes:

Consider a 1/2-[[BPS state]] solution of [[type II supergravity]] or [[11-dimensional supergravity]], respectively. These solutions locally happen to have the same classification as the Green-Schwarz branes. Hence we may consider a configuration $\phi \colon \Sigma \to X$ of the corresponding fundamental $p$-brane which embeds $\Sigma$ into the asymptotic AdS boundary of the given 1/2 BPS spacetime $X$. Then it turns out that restricting the Green-Schwarz action functional to small fluctuations around this configuration, and applying a [[diffeomorphism]] [[gauge fixing]], then the resulting action functional is that of a [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] [[conformal field theory]] on $\Sigma$ as in the [[AdS-CFT]] dictionary:

| fundamental $p$-brane | -fluctuations about asymptotic AdS configuration$\to$ |  solitonic $p$-brane |
|----|-----|---|
| Green-Schwarz action functional |  | [[supersymmetric|super]]-[[conformal field theory]] |

([Claus-Kallosh-Proeyen 97](#ClausKalloshProeyen97), [Claus-Kallosh-Kumar-Townsend 98](#ClausKalloshKumarTownsend98), [AFFFTT 98](#AFFFTT98) [Pasti-Sorokin-Tonin 99](#PastiSorokinTonin99))

In fact the [[BPS-state]] condition itself is neatly encoded in the Green-Schwarz action functionals: by construction they are invariant under the [[spacetime]] [[superisometry group]]. Hence the [[Noether theorem]] implies that there are corresponding [[conserved currents]], whose [[Dickey bracket]] forms a super-[[Lie algebra extension]] of the Lie algebra of supersymmetries.

Here the "$\swArrow$" filling the triangles is the non-trivial gauge transformation by which the [[WZW term]] (as any WZW term) is preserved under the symmetries (instead of being fixed identically). It is the information in this transformations which makes the currents form an extension of the symmetries.

Here this yields the famous brane charge extensions of the super-isometry super Lie algebra of the schematic form

$$
  \{Q_\alpha, Q_\beta\}
  \;=\;
  (C \Gamma^a_{\alpha \beta}) P_a
  \;+\;
  (C \Gamma^{a_1 \cdots a_p})_{\alpha \beta} Z_{a_1, \cdots, a_p}
$$

(for $Q$ a [[Killing spinor]] and $P$ its corresponding [[Killing vector]]) known as the [[type II supersymmetry algebra]] and the [[M-theory supersymmetry algebra]], respectively ([Azc√°rraga-Gauntlett-Izquierdo-Townsend 89](#AGIT89)). In fact it yields super-[[L-infinity algebra extensions|Lie n-algebra extensions]] of which the familiar super Lie algebra extensions are the 0-truncation ([Sati-Schreiber 15](#SatiSchreiber15), [[schreiber:Local prequantum field theory|Khavkine-Schreiber 16]]).

In summary, the nature and classification of Green-Schwarz action functionals captures in a mathematically precise way a good deal of the core structure of [[string theory|string]]/[[M-theory]].

In fact, the [[super L-infinity algebra|super L-infinity algebraic]] perspective on the Green-Schwarz functionals via [[schreiber:The brane bouquet]] also solves the following open problem on [[M-branes]]:

it is famously known from [[Freed-Witten anomaly]]-cancellation that the [[D-brane charges]] are not in fact just in [[de Rham cohomology]] in every second degree, but are in [[twisted K-theory]], hence [[rational homotopy theory|rationally]] in [[twisted de Rham cohomology]], with the twist being the [[F1-brane]] charge (from the fundamental). It is an open problem to determine what becomes of these [[twisted K-theory]] charge groups as one lifts F1/D$p$-branes in string theory to M2/M5-branes in [[M-theory]].


|   | intersecting branes | charges in [[generalized cohomology theory]]
|-----|--------------|----------------------|
| [[string theory]] | [[F1-brane|F1]]/[[D-brane|Dp-branes]] | [[twisted K-theory]] |
| [[M-theory]]  | [[M2-brane|M2]]/[[M5-branes]] | ??? |

Notice that there are "microscopic degrees of freedom" of the theory encoded by the choice of [[generalized cohomology theory]] here, generalizing the extra degrees of freedom in the choice of a WZW-term already mentioned above. In general for $E$ a cohomology theory and $E \longrightarrow E \otimes \mathbb{Q}$ its [[Chern character]] map (for instance from [[topological K-theory]] to [[ordinary cohomology]] in every second degree), then a choice of genuine charges is the extra information encoded in a lift

But [[rational homotopy theory|rationally]] [[schreiber:The brane bouquet]] allows to derive this from first principles:

Above we saw that the naive cocycles of the [[D-branes]] and of the [[M5-brane]] are not defined on the actual [[spacetime]],  but on some "extended" spacetime, which is really a [[smooth super infinity-groupoid]] extension of spacetime. Hence we should ask if these cocycles [[descent|descend]] to the actual super-spacetime while picking up some twists.

One may prove that:

* the F1/D$p$-brane GS-WZW cocycles descend to 10d type II superspacetime to form a single cocycle in rational twisted K-theory, just as the traditional lore reqires ([Fiorenza-Sati-Schreiber 16](#FiorenzaSatiSchreiber16));

* the M2/M5 GS-WZW cocycles descent to 11d superspacetime to form a single cocycle with values in the [[rational n-sphere|rational 4-sphere]] ([Fiorenza-Sati-Schreiber 16](#FiorenzaSatiSchreiber16)).

This has implications on some open conjectures regarding [[M-theory]], for more on this see _[[schreiber:Equivariant cohomology of M2/M5-branes]]_.









#### Super Lie $n$-algebras

(...)

 [[super L-infinity algebra]]

 (...)

The [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebras]] which in def. \ref{CEAlgebra} and def. \ref{SuperLieAlgebraViaCE} we used to _characterize_ the corresponding (super) Lie algebras are of course traditionally introduced as the [[cochain complexes]] whose [[cochain cohomology]] is [[Lie algebra cohomology]]. We may conceptualize this as follows:

+-- {: .num_defn #SiteCartSp}
###### Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ write $\mathbb{R}^{1|0}[n]$ for the _[[line Lie n-algebra|line Lie (n+1)-algebra]]_, the [[super L-infinity algebra]] defined simply as the [[formal dual]] to the $(\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{Z}_2)$-graded commutative [[dg-algebra]]

$$
  CE(\mathbb{R}^{1|0}[n]) \coloneqq
  \left(
    \wedge^\bullet \mathbb{R}^{1|0}[n],
    \;
    d = 0
  \right)
$$

whose underlying [[graded algebra]] is freely generated from a single generator in degree $(n,even)$, and whose differential vanishes.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark #LieAlgebraCohomologAsHomomorphism}
###### Remark

Recall that being a "[[formal dual]]" to a dg-algebra here simply means that for $\mathfrak{g}$ any [[super Lie algebra]], the homomorphisms of [[super L-infinity algebras]] of the form

$$
  \mu \;\colon\; \mathfrak{g} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^{1|0}[n]
$$

are equivalently (by definition!) homomorphisms of [[dg-algebras]] of the form

$$
  CE(\mathfrak{g})
  \longleftarrow
  CE(\mathbb{R}^{1|0}[n])
  \,.
$$

Since the underlying graded algebra of $CE(\mathbb{R}^{1|0}[n])$ is free on a single generator $c$ in degree $n+1$, such a homomorphism is determined by the image of this generator

$$
  c \mapsto \mu \in CE(\mathfrak{g})
  \,.
$$

Moreover, the condition that this map respects the differentials, and since the differential on $CE(\mathbb{R}^{1|0}[n])$ vanishes by definition, this means that

$$
  \array{
     c &\mapsto& && \mu
     \\
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{d_{\mathbb{R}^{1|0}[n]}}}
     && &&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{d_{\mathfrak{g}}}}
     \\
     0 &\mapsto& 0 &=& d_{\mathfrak{g}}\mu
  }
  \,.
$$

Hence such a moprhism $\mu$ is equivalently a _closed_ element of degree $(n+1)$ in $CE(\mathfrak{g})$, hence is equivalently a [[Lie algebra cohomology|super Lie algebra cocycle]] of degree $n+1$ on $\mathfrak{g}$.

This way [[line Lie n-algebra|line Lie (n+1)-algebra]] $\mathbb{R}^{1|0}[n]$ is the _[[moduli stack|moduli object]]_ for degree-$(n+1)$ Lie algebra cohomology in direct [[analogy]] of how for instance the familiar [[Eilenberg-MacLane space]] $B^{n+1}\mathbb{R} = K(\mathbb{Z},n+1)$ is the classifying space for degree $n+1$ [[ordinary cohomology]] of [[topological spaces]].

=--

One advantange of conceptualizing Lie algebra cocycles as in remark \ref{LieAlgebraCohomologAsHomomorphism} is that it neatly connects to the formulation of [[Lie algebra valued forms]] according to def. \ref{LieAlgValuedFormsViaDgAlgHoms}, def. \ref{SuperLieAlgValuedDiffForms}:


+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

A $\mathbb{R}^{1|0}[n]$-valued differential form is simply an even closed differential $(n+1)$-form:

$$
  \Omega^1(\mathbb{R}^{p|q}, \mathbb{R}^{1|0}[n])
  \simeq
  Hom(CE(\mathbb{R}^{1|0}[n]), \Omega^\bullet(\mathbb{R}^{p|q}))
  \simeq
  \Omega^{n+1}(\mathbb{R}^{p|q})_{even,closed}
  \,.
$$

Hence a super Lie algebra $(n+1)$-cocycle $\mu$ on
$\mathfrak{g}$ naturally determines a map


$$
  \mu(-)
  \colon
  \Omega^1(\mathbb{R}^{p|q},\mathfrak{g})
  \longrightarrow
  \Omega^{n+1}(\mathbb{R}^{p|q})_{even,closed}
$$

given by forming the composite with the morphism representing the cocycle $\mu$

$$
  \left(
    \Omega^\bullet(\mathbb{R}^{p|q})
     \stackrel{A}{\longleftarrow}
  CE(\mathfrak{g})
  \right)
  \mapsto
  \left(
  \Omega^\bullet(\mathbb{R}^{p|q})
   \stackrel{A}{\longleftarrow}
  CE(\mathfrak{g})
  \stackrel{\mu^\ast}{\longleftarrow}
  CE(\mathbb{R}^{1|0}[n])
  \right)
$$

sending a [[Lie algebra valued form]] $A$ to a closed differential form $\mu(A)$.

###### Remark

The study of the CE-elements in def. \ref{ThePsiPsiTermsInCEOfSuperMinkowski} goes back to ([D'Auria-Fr√© 82](#DAuriaFre82)). These authors write $\frac{i}{2}\overline{(-)}\Gamma (-)$ for the bilinear pairing which we write just $\overline{(-)}\Gamma (-)$.

=--

One finds that the elements $\mu_{p+2}$ in def. \ref{ThePsiPsiTermsInCEOfSuperMinkowski} are CE-closed, hence are super Lie algebra cocycles for given $(d,p,N)$, precisely if there is a [[super p-brane]] in $N$-supersymmetric super-Minkowski spacetime on which no other super $p$-brane may end. For "$N=1$" there are (non-trivial) cocycles in dimension $d$ and degree $(p+2)$ as shown in this table:

#### The full brane scan

Every Lie algebra cocycle $\mu_{p+2} \colon \mathfrak{g} \longrightarrow b^{p+1}\mathbb{R}$ induces a [[L-‚àû algebra cohomology|higher extension]] of its domain, namely the [[Lie n-algebra|Lie (p+1)-algebra]] $\hat \mathfrak{g}$ which is the [[homotopy fiber]] of $\mu_{p+2}$ in the [[homotopy theory of L-‚àû algebras]]:

$$
  \array{
     \hat \mathfrak{g}
     \\
     \downarrow
     \\
     \mathfrak{g}
     &\stackrel{\mu_{p+2}}{\longrightarrow}&
     b^{p+1}\mathbb{R}
  }
  \,.
$$

For the cocycles on [[super Minkowski spacetime]] from the [old brane scan](#TheOldBraneScan) these extensions are known as _[[extended super Minkowski spacetimes]]_.

$$
  \array{
     \hat \mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert \mathbf{N}}
     \\
     \downarrow
     \\
     \mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert \mathbf{N}}
     &\stackrel{\mu_{p+2}}{\longrightarrow}&
     b^{p+1}\mathbb{R}
  }
  \,.
$$

Now the extended super Minkowski spacetime $\hat \mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert \mathbf{N}}$ may carry further cocycles, that do not come from ordinary super Minkowski spacetime. Including these yields the full brane scan.

This complete brane scan is no longer just a table, but is a tree, a bouquet, where each edge is an $L_\infty$-extension.

By the discussion at _[[‚àû-action]]_ this exhibits a $b^{p}\mathbb{R}$-action on $b^{2p+2}\mathbb{R}$, for which $b^{2p+2} \mathbb{R}/b^{p}\mathbb{R}$ is the [[homotopy quotient]], whence the notation.

As a mathematical statement prop. \ref{CocyclesOn11dSuperMinkowski} is originally due to ([D'Auria-Fr√© 82, p.18](#DAuriaFre82)), where it is considered as an ingredient for constructing the [[action functional]] of [[11-dimensional supergravity]] in the [[D'Auria-Fr√© formulation of supergravity]].

Such a natural action is given by prop. \ref{b2RactionOnb2p2R}.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

That the diagram exists and commutes at the level of the underlying graded algebras of the [[formal dual]] CE-algebras is immediate in terms of the defining generators: each generator is mapped to the generator of the same name, if present, in the codomain, or to zero otherwise, except for $g_7 \in CE(b^6 \mathbb{R})$ which is sent to $h_3 \wedge \mu_4  + \frac{1}{15}\mu_7$ and $g_7 \in CE(b^6 \mathbb{R}/b^2 \mathbb{R})$, which is sent to $h_3 \wedge (g_4 + \mu_4) + \frac{1}{15}\mu_7 $, as indicated.

It remains to check that the middle horizontal map respects the CE-differentials: by prop. \ref{CocyclesOn11dSuperMinkowski} we have

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    d(h_3 \wedge (g_4 + \mu_4) + \frac{1}{15}\mu_7)
    &=
    (g_4 - \mu_4) \wedge (g_4 + \mu_4) + \mu_4 \wedge \mu_4
    \\
    & = g_4 \wedge g_4
  \end{aligned}
$$

and by def. \ref{RationalSphereAlgebra} this says indeed that $g_7 \mapsto h_3 \wedge (g_4 + \mu_4) + \frac{1}{15}\mu_7$ respects the CE-differentials.

###### Remark

In view of remark \ref{RationalSpheres}, prop. \ref{7CocycleOnM2BraneDescends} says that the CE-elements $\mu_4$ and $\mu_7$ of prop. \ref{CocyclesOn11dSuperMinkowski} define a cocycle with values in the rational 4-sphere. In the discussions in _[[geometry of physics -- WZW terms]]_ and _[[geometry of physics -- BPS charges]]_ we see that under [[Lie integration]] and globalization in [[higher Cartan geometry]], these elements encode the [[supergravity C-field]] and its [[electric-magnetic duality|magnetic dual]]. That these fields should take values in the 4-sphere was first suggested in ([Sati 13, section 2.5](Hisham+Sati#Sati13)).
