## Idea

In the category of 'spaces', many invariants are homotopy invariants, so as well as giving a functor on the category of spaces taking values, say, in the category of Abelian groups, it also induces one on the 'homotopy category', that is the category of spaces and homotopy classes of maps between them.  This 'homotopy category' construction can be viewed as a general construction on categories having a congruence relation on their hom-sets, and hence as a sort of way of extracting an interesting and hopefully more tractable, category from a 'higher category' of some sort, perhaps a 2-category or more generally an $(\infty,1)$-category. The relationship between the higher category, the basic category, say of spaces, and this 'homotopy category' is simple, but needs looking at from the nPOV.

Quite often one encounters an ordinary [[category]] $C$ which is known in some way or other to be the $1$-[[1-category|categorical]] truncation of a [[higher category theory|higher category]] $\hat C$. 
Standard examples include the categories [[SimpSet]] of [[simplicial set]]s (or [[Top]] of [[topological space]]s) and $Ch(Ab)$ of [[chain complex]]es of [[abelian group]]s. Both are obtained from full [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categories]] by forgetting higher morphisms.

The most important information that is lost by forgetting the higher morphisms of a higher category is that about which 1-morphisms are, while not [[isomorphism]]s, invertible up to higher cells, i.e. [[equivalence]]s. 

To the full $(\infty,1)$-category $\hat C$ is canonically associated a 1-category $Ho(\hat C)$ called the [[homotopy category of an (infinity,1)-category]], which is obtained from $\hat C$ not by simply forgetting the higher morphisms, but by quotienting them out, i.e. by remembering the _equivalence classes_ of 1-morphisms. In the $(\infty,1)$-category [[Top]] (restricted to sufficiently nice objects, such as compactly generated weakly Hausdorff topological spaces) these higher morphisms are literally the [[homotopy|homotopies]] between 1-morphisms, and more generally one tends to address higher cells in $(\infty,1)$-categories as homotopies. Therefore the name _homotopy category of an $(\infty,1)$-category_ for $Ho(\hat C)$. In particular $Ho(\hat{Top})$ is the standard homotopy category originally introduced in topology.


Now a slightly different viewpoint comes in that interacts neatly with this one of 'dividing out by 1-morphisms'.  Suppose we are given just the truncated 1-category $C$, but now equipped with the structure of a [[category with weak equivalences]] which indicates which morphisms in $C$ are to be regarded as equivalences in a higher categorical context, there is a universal solution to the problem of finding a category $Ho(C)$ equipped with a functor $Q : C \to Ho(C)$ such that $Q$ sends all (morphisms labeled as) weak equivalences in 
$C$ to isomorphisms in $Ho(C)$.

In good situations, one may also find an $(\infty,1)$-category $\hat C$ corresponding to $C$, and the notions of homotopy category $Ho(C)$ and $Ho(\hat C)$ then coincide. 

This is, in particular, the case when $C$ is equipped with the structure of a combinatorial [[simplicial model category]] and $\hat C$ is the $(\infty,1)$-category [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presented]] by $C$ with its model structure. (For instance [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, remark A.3.1.8]]).

 We thus have several interrelated notions of homotopy category, which in most useful contexts more or less coincide.  Because of that, the term tends to be used widely, and the context then determines the exact definition to apply. We will give some of the most common ones, selected for their use in other entries.

##Definition (for a simplicially enriched category)

Given a simplicially enriched category $C$, we can form for each pair of objects, $x,y$, of objects of $C$, the set, $\pi_0C(x,y)$, of connected components of the 'function space' $C(x,y)$.  As $\pi_0$ preserves finite limits, this gives a category, denoted $\pi_0(C)$.  As 1-simplices in $C(x,y)$ can be often interpreted as being homotopies, this category $\pi_0(C)$ is often called the _homotopy category of $C$_, and then the notation $Ho(C)$ may be used.  


This notions is closely related to the next, by using, say the [[hammock localisation]] of Dwyer and Kan, as then $\pi_0$ of that simplicially enriched category, coincides with the following.

## Definition (of a category with weak equivalences)

Given a [[category with weak equivalences]] (such as a [[model category]]), its __homotopy category__ $Ho(C)$ is -- if it exists -- the [[category]] which is universal with the property that there is a [[functor]]

$$
 Q :  C \to Ho(C)
$$

that sends every weak equivalence in $C$ to an [[isomorphism]] in $Ho(C)$. 

One also writes $Ho(C) := W^{-1}C$ or $C[W^{-1}]$ and calls it the [[localization]] of $C$ at the collection $W$ of weak equivalences.

More in detail, the universality of $Ho(C)$ means the following:

* for any (possibly [[large category|large]]) category $A$ and functor $F : C \to A$ such that $F$ sends all $w \in W$ to isomorphisms in $A$, there exists a functor $F_Q : Ho(C) \to A$ and a natural isomorphism

$$
  \array{
     C &&\stackrel{F}{\to}& A
     \\
     \downarrow^Q& \Downarrow^{\simeq}& \nearrow_{F_Q}
     \\
     Ho(C)
  }
$$


* the functor $Q^* : Func(Ho(C),A) \to Func(C,A)$ is a [[full and faithful functor]].


The second condition implies that the functor $F_Q$ in the first condition is unique up to unique isomorphism.


## Properties

* If it exists, the homotopy category $Ho(C)$ is unique up to [[equivalence of categories]].



* As described at [[localization]], in general, the morphisms of $Ho(C)$ must be constructed using zigzags of morphisms in $C$ in which the backwards-pointing arrows are weak equivalences.  This means that in general, $Ho(C)$ need not be [[locally small category|locally small]] even if $C$ is.  However, in many cases (such as any [[model category]]) there is a more direct description of the morphisms in $Ho(C)$ as [[homotopy]] classes of maps in $C$ between suitably "good" (fibrant and cofibrant) objects.

* In [[2-limit|2-categorical terms]], the homotopy category $Ho(C)$ is the _coinverter_ of the canonical 2-cell
$$\array{& \to \\ W & \Downarrow & C\\ & \to}$$
where $W$ is the category whose objects are morphisms in $W$ and whose morphisms are commutative squares in $C$.



## Examples

* In classical [[homotopy theory]], _the_ homotopy category refers to the homotopy category [[Ho(Top)]] of [[Top]] with weak equivalences taken to be [[weak homotopy equivalences]].

* [[Ho(Top)]] is often restricted to the [[full subcategory]] of spaces of the [[homotopy type]] of a [[CW-complex]] (the full subcategory of CW-complexes in $Ho(Top)$). This is equivalent to $Ho(sSet_{Quillen})$, the homotopy category of the standard Quillen-[[model structure on simplicial sets]]. This equivalence is one aspect of the [[homotopy hypothesis]].

* In [[homological algebra]] the localization of the [[category of chain complexes]] at the [[quasi-isomorphisms]] is called the _[[derived category]]_. But see also at _[[homotopy category of chain complexes]]_.

* In [[stable homotopy theory]] one considers the homotopy category of [[spectra]].

* For the homotopy category of [[Cat]], see [[Ho(Cat)]].
