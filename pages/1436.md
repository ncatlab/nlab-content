Eckmann and Hilton noticed that a number of notions and theorems in the homotopy theory of [[pointed object|pointed]] topological spaces can be dualized in the sense of certain expanding dictionary:

* homotopy -- cohomology

* fibration  -- cofibration

* mapping cylinder -- mapping cocylinder

* suspension $\Sigma X$ -- loop space $\Omega X$

The "duality" in their work has been just a heuristics rather than a systematic algorithm to dualize constructions and theorems. It has a little flavour of working with [[adjoint functors]], though it does not reduce to Kan adjointness. 

Later some versions have been made rigorous, most well-known being the Fuks duality in homotopy theory.

D. B. Fuks considers the category $End(kTop_*)$ of endofunctors on the category $kTop_*$ of pointed [[compactly generated space|compactly generated]] Hausdorff spaces. He enriches this category in $kTop_*$ as follows: Let $S,T$ be two endofunctors, then the set $\{S\to T\}$ of isomorphism classes of natural transformations $S\to T$ is equipped with the weakest topology in which all maps $\alpha_X$, $X\in kTop_*$ of taking components $\{S\to T\}\mapsto Map(S(X),T(X))\in kTop_*$ are continuous. Recall that the topology on the set of maps $S(X)\to T(X)$ in $kTop_*$ is obatined by first taking the compact-open topology and then performing the [[kaonization]] of the space so obtained. 

A **Fuks duality** is any functor $D: End(kTop_*)\to End(kTop_*)$ such that 

1. for any two functors $S,T\in End(kTop_*)$, $\{S\to DT\}$ is binaturally homeomorphic to
$\{DS\to T\}$ 

2. $D\Sigma =\Omega$, $D\Omega = \Sigma$.

**Theorem.(D. B. Fuks)** There exists a unique Fuks duality functor. 

Notice that $D^2 = D\circ D$ is not isomorphic to the identity in general, though it is identical when applied to a number of natural endofunctors in homotopy theory. Fuks duality can be extended suitably to functors of many arguments.
