## Definition

A __Cartesian space__ is a [[topological space]] of the form $\mathbb{R}^n$: the $n$-fold [[Cartesian product]] in [[Top]] of the [[real line]] $\mathbb{R}$ with itself where $n$ is some [[natural number]] (possibly zero).
There is a canonical [[smooth structure]] on $\mathbb{R}^n$ that makes it a [[smooth manifold]].

In particular:
*  $\mathbb{R}^0$ is the [[point]],
*  $\mathbb{R}^1$ is the real line itself,
*  $\mathbb{R}^2$ is the real plane, which may be identified (in two canonical ways) with the [[complex number|complex plane]] $\mathbb{C}$.

Sometimes one is interested in allowing $n$ to take other values, in which case one wants a [[product]] in some category that might not be the Cartesian product on underlying sets.

For example, if one is studying Cartesian spaces as inner product spaces, then one might want an $\aleph_0$-dimensional Cartesian space to be the $\aleph_0$-dimensional [[Hilbert space]] $l^2$, which is a proper subset of the cartesian product $\mathbb{R}^{\aleph_0}$.


## Properties

### The category of Cartesian spaces

Note that a Cartesian space has maximal structure; it comes equipped with a system of coordinates.  Usually we are interested only in some of this structure; what is useful is that the category [[CartSp]] of cartesian spaces and (appropriately) structure-preserving maps is a [[small category]] equivalent to the (usually large) category of *all* finite-dimensional spaces with the structure in question.  This holds at least in the following examples:

*  [[vector space]]s,
*  [[affine space]]s,
*  [[normed vector space]]s,
*  [[inner product space]]s,
*  [[Euclidean space]]s.

$Cart Sp$ can also be understood, for appropriate morphisms, as a category of models for at least the following examples:

*  topological [[manifold]]s,
*  [[smooth space]]s,
*  [[Riemannian manifold]]s.

### Topological structure

The [[open n-ball]] is [[homeomorphic]] [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$

$$
  \mathbb{B}^n \simeq \mathbb{R}^n
  \,.
$$


### Smooth structures

For all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the [[open n-ball]] with its standard [[smooth structure]] is [[diffeomorphic]] to the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ with its standard smooth structure

$$
  \mathbb{B}^n \simeq \mathbb{R}^n
  \,.
$$

In fact, in $d \neq 4$ there is no choice:

###### Theorem

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ a [[natural number]] with $n \neq 4$, there is a unique (up to [[isomorphism]]) smooth structure on the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$.

This was shown in ([Stallings](#Stallings)).

###### Theorem

In $d = 4$ the analog of this statement is false. One says that on $\mathb{R}^4$ there exist [[exotic smooth structure]]s.

###### Theorem

In [[dimension]] $d \in \mathbb{N}$ for $d \neq 4$ we have:

every open subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$ which is [[homeomorphic]] to $\mathbb{B}^d$ is also [[diffeomorphic]] to it.

###### Remark

In dimension 4 the analog statement fails due to the existence of [[exotic smooth structure]]s on $\mathbb{R}^4$.
