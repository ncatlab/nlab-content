## Idea

A [[function]] is meant to be called _computable_ if its values on given input may be obtained by an actual [[computation]] (an [[algorithm]]). Making this precise and studying properties of computable functions is the topic of _[[computability theory]]_.

There are two main concepts of computable functions, called "type I" and "type II": 

* In the type I case one considers functions operating on "finite strings of a finite alphabet" hence equivalently on the set of [[natural numbers]]. The computable functions in this case are _[[partial recursive functions]]_.

* In the type II case one considers functions operating on "infinit strings of a finite alphabet" hence equivalently on the set of infinite sequences of [[natural numbers]] ("[[Baire space (computability)|Baire space]]"). The idea here is that the computation may be continued indefinitely to produce results always of finite but of ever increasing precision. Therefore this type II-concept is of relevance for computability in [[analysis]], hence in _[[computable analysis]]/[[constructive analysis]]_.  See at _[[computable function (analysis)]]_.

The following table summarizes this and related concepts:
