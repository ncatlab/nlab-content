# Refutation by contradiction

## Idea

*Refutation by contradiction* is the "basic" method of [[formal proof]] for proving a [[negation]]: if assuming $P$ leads to a contradiction, then we conclude $\neg P$.  It is the [[introduction rule]] for the [[connective]] of [[negation]]; if $\neg P$ is defined as $P\to \bot$, then it follows from the introduction rule for [[implication]].

Refutation by contradiction is also called *proof of negation*, but this can be confusing because there may be other "indirect" ways to prove a negation.
