# Refutation by contradiction

## Idea

*Refutation by contradiction* is the "basic" method of [[formal proof]] for proving a [[negation]]: if assuming $P$ leads to a [[contradiction]], then we conclude $\neg P$.  It is the [[introduction rule]] for the [[connective]] of [[negation]]; if $\neg P$ is defined as $P\to \bot$ (the [[function type]] from $P$ to [[false]]), then it follows from the introduction rule for [[implication]].

Refutation by contradiction is also called *proof of negation*, but this can be confusing because there may be other "indirect" ways to prove a negation.

Rarely one finds logics that have a basic notion of "refutation of $A$" that is distinct from (though generally closely related to) a "proof of $\neg A$" [(Nelson 1949)](#Nelson49).  In that case, refutation by contradiction is more precisely a method of refuting $A$ by deriving a contradiction from an assumption of $A$, which then requires an extra step to get to a proof of $\neg A$.
