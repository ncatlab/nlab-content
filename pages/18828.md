 {#GaugeFixing}


We had seen [above](#PhaseSpace) that the key intermediate construction for obtaining the [[quantum field theory]]
induced from a [[Lagrangian density]] is its _[[covariant phase space]]_ (prop. \ref{CovariantPhaseSpace}).
But then we have seen that there are generically [[obstructions]] to the existence of the [[covariant phase space]], embodied by
[[infinitesimal gauge transformation]] that have been "left implicit" (prop. \ref{NonTrivialImplicitInfinitesimalGaugeSymmetriesPbstructExistenceOfCauchySurfaces}).
We have then discussed the [[reduced phase space]] [above](#ReducedPhaseSpace) which makes the
[[infinitesimal gauge symmetries]] "explicit" by forming their [[homotopy quotient]], whose
[[algebra of functions]], on the derived [[shell]], is the _[[BV-BRST complex]]_ of the theory.
It remains to show that this construction of the [[reduced phase space]] indeed serves to lift the
[[obstruction]] to the existence of the [[covariant phase space]]. This is the topic of _[[gauge fixing]]_ (def. ... below).

The point is that while the [[reduced phase space]] reflected by the [[BV-BRST complex]] may still not be
_manifestly_ covariant, its existence as an object in [[homotopy theory]], here specifically in [[homological algebra]],
means that it comes with a more flexible concept of "[[equality]]", namely _[[homotopy equivalence]]_, which here
specifically means _[[quasi-isomorphism]]_.

Broadly speaking, the [[gauge principle]] in [[physics]], says that no two things ([[field histories]], etc.)
are ever really [[equality|equal]], instead they may be connected by [[gauge transformations]], and the mathematical
reflection of that is the principle of [[homotopy theory]], where no two [[homotopy types]] are ever equal,
instead they may be connected by ([[weak homotopy equivalence|weak]]) [[homotopy equivalence]].
Hence picking a specific representative of a [[homotopy type]] means to _fix a gauge_.


Concretely, let $(E,\mathbf{L})$ be a [[Lagrangian field theory]] with closed irreducibe [[gauge parameter]] bundle
$\mathcal{G}$ and let $BV(s)$ be the corresponding [[BV-BRST complex]] (prop. \ref{LocalBVBRSTComplexIsDerivedCriticalLocusOfEulerLagrangeForm}).

We then ask for another field bundle $E^g$, possibly itself already a [[graded manifold]],
hence an object in [[higher differential geometry]],
and then we ask for a [[Lagrangian density]] $\mathbf{L}^g$ that
may also genuinely live in [[higher prequantum geometry]],
hence which is defined right away on the action Lie algebroid $E^g(\mathcal{G} \times_\Sigma T_\Sigma)$ (example \ref{LocalOffShellBRSTComplex})
not necessarily descending to there from $E^g$ itself.
We may still form the local [[derived critical locus]] of $\mathbf{L}^g$ in
$E^g(\mathcal{G} \times_\Sigma T \Sigma)$ and obtain a corresponding BV-BRST-like complex $BV(s^g)$.

We ask now that $BV(s^g)$ has particularly good properties:

1. We ask that the Koszul-Tate component $s^g_{BV}$ of $s^g$ has vanishing [[cochain cohomology]] in negative degree,
which means by prop. \ref{BVComplexIsHomologicalResolutionPreciselyIfNoNonTrivialImplicitGaugeSymmetres}
that the Lagrnagian $\mathbf{L}^g$ on the _graded_ field bundle $E^g$ is _degreewise_ free of the
[[obstruction]] to the existence of a covariant phase space.

1. We ask moreover that the remaining Chevalley-Eilenberg component $s^g_{BRST}$ of $s^g$ is compatible with the graded [[Poisson bracket]] of this graded [[covariant phase space]]

This means that the "dg-Lagrangian field theory "$(E^g, \mathbf{L}^g)$ induces a [[covariant phase space|covariant]] [[reduced phase space]]
"[[internalization|internal to]]" [[dg-manifolds]]; hence a "dg-covariant reduced phase space":
a [[graded object|graded]] covariant reduced phase space equipped with compatible differentials.

Such derived phase spaces $BV(s^g)$ are amenable to _degreewise_ [[quantization]] (discussed [below](#Quantization))
if only one can  keep the degreewise quantization compatible with the [[differential]].
This may be shown (below...) to be the case, and hence  performing the quantization degreewise and passing in the end to the [[cochain cohomology]] of the resulting BV-BRST complex of quantum observables yields the _[[gauge invariant]] [[local observables]]_
of the quantum field theory. This is called the "[[BV-BRST quantization]] of [[gauge theories]]".

In order to apply this to the [[Lagrangian field theory]] $(E,\mathbf{L})$ that we actually started out to
consider, we now only need to ensure that the "manifestly covariant" dg-Lagrangian field theory
$(E^g, \mathbf{L}^g)$ is  not necessarily [[equality|equal]] to $(E,\mathbf{L})$, but [[homotopy equivalent]] to it,
as an object in [[higher prequantum geometry]], hence that there is a [[quasi-isomorphism]] between the
corresponding [[BV-BRST complexes]]

$$
  BV(s^g) \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} BV(s)
  \,.
$$

The choice of this [[quasi-isomorphism]] hence means a choice of particularly good (namely manifestly covariant)
_representative_ of the [[homotopy type]] of $BV(s)$, and hence this is called a _gauge fixing_ of $BV(s)$.

In practice this choice of gauge fixing by choice of quasi-isomorphism to a "manifestly covariant" [[BV-BRST complex]]
is realized as the composite of two seperate quasi-isomorphisms:

1. an "anti-canonical transformation"

   $$
     e^{-\{\psi,-\}} \;\colon\; BV(s^g) \longrightarrow BV( \exp^{-\{\psi,-\}} s^g )
   $$

   (induced by a degree -1 element $\psi$ called, for better or worse, the "[[gauge fixing fermion]]")
  which is actually a genuine [[isomorphism]], not just a [[quasi-isomorphism]];

1. a genuine [[quasi-isomorphism]] which contracts away a [[contractible space|contractible]] [[direct sum|direct summand]]
   of [[auxiliary fields]]

Consider the [[local BV-BRST complex]]

$$
  \left(
    E/(\mathcal{G} \times_\Sigma T \Sigma)
  \right)_{d L \simeq 0}
$$

for [[vacuum]] [[electromagnetism]] on [[Minkowski spacetime]] from example \ref{LocalBVComplexOfVacuumElectromagnetismOnMinkowskiSpacetime}:

The [[field bundle]] is $E \coloneqq T^\ast \Sigma$ and the [[gauge parameter]] bundle is $\mathcal{G} \coloneqq \Sigma \times \mathbb{R}$.
The 0-jet generators are

$$
  \array{
    & c^\ddagger & (a^\ddagger)^\mu & a_\mu & c
    \\
    deg =
    &
    -2 & -1 & 0 & 1

$$

and the [[BV-BRST differential]] acts as

$$
  s
  \;\colon\;
  \left\{
  \array{
    a_\mu &\mapsto& c_{,\mu} & \text{(infinitesimal gauge transformation)}

    (a^\ddagger)^\mu &\mapsto&  f^{\nu \mu}_{,\nu}  & \text{(equations of Motion -- vacuum Maxwell equations)}
    \\
    c^\ddagger &\mapsto& (a^\ddagger)^\mu_{,\mu} & \text{(Noether identity)}
  }
  \right.
$$

The [[Lagrangian density]] for [[vacuum]] [[electromagnetism]] is (eq:ElectromagnetismLagrangian)

$$
  \label{VacuumEMLagrangianDensityRecalledForNLFields}
  \mathbf{L}_{em} \coloneqq \tfrac{1}{2} f_{\mu \nu} f^{\mu \nu}

Consider the [[contractible chain complex]] of [[vector bundles]] over $\Sigma$

$$
  NL

    \Sigma \times\langle b\rangle
    \\
    deg = & -1 && 0
  }
  \right)
  \,.
$$

In this context $\Sigma \times \langle b\rangle$ is called the [[field bundle]] for the _[[Nakanishi-Lautrup field]]_ and $\Sigma \times \langle \overline{c}\rangle$ that for the _[[antighost field]]_.

The corresponding product [[BV-BRST complex]] [[quasi-isomorphism|quasi-isomorphic]] to the original one

$$
  \left(
    E/(\mathcal{G} \times_\Sigma T \Sigma)
  \right)_{d L \simeq 0} \times_\Sigma NL

has coordinate generators

$$
  \array{

    \\
    & & \overline{c} & b
    \\
    deg =

    -2 & -1 & 0 & 1

  \,.
$$

We say that the _Nakanishi-Lautrup [[gauge fixing fermion]] for Gaussian averaged [[Lorentz gauge]]_ is

$$
  \label{NLGaugeFixingFermion}
  \psi
     \coloneqq
  \overline{c}( b + a^{\mu}_{,\mu} )
  \;\in\;
  CE\left(
    \left(
      E/(\mathcal{G} \times_\Sigma T \Sigma)
    \right)_{d L \simeq 0} \times_\Sigma NL
  \right)
  \,.
$$

With $L_{NL}$ denoting the anti-Hamiltonin for the differential $s_{NL}$ of the [[resolution|resolved]] [[local BV-BRST complex]] $  \left(E/(\mathcal{G} \times_\Sigma T \Sigma) \right)_{d L \simeq 0} \times_\Sigma NL$ we find from (eq:VacuumEMLagrangianDensityRecalledForNLFields) and (eq:NLGaugeFixingFermion) the [[antibracket]]

$$
  \{\psi,L_{NL}\} = b ( b + a^{\mu}_{,\mu} ) + \overline{c}_{,\mu} c^{,\mu}
$$

and then

$$
  \{\psi, \{\psi, L_{NL}\}\} = 0
  \,.
$$

Therefore the corresponding [[gauge fixing|gauge fixed]] [[Lagrangian density]] is

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \mathbf{L}^g
      & \coloneqq
    \e^{\{\psi,-\}}\mathbf{L}_{NL}

    \right) dvol_\Sigma
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

(see also [Henneaux 90, section 9.1](Nakanishi-Lautrup+field#Henneaux90))

The [[Euler-Lagrange equation|Euler-Lagrange]] [[equation of motion]] induced by this Lagrangian density $\mathbf{L}^g$ (def \ref{EulerLagrangeEquationsOnTrivialVectorFieldBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime}) are


$$

  \right.
$$

Here on the left we show the equations as the appear directly from the [[Euler-Lagrange variational derivative]]
(prop. \ref{EulerLagrangeOperatorForTivialVectorBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime}).
The operator $\Box$ on the right is the [[wave operator]] (example \ref{EquationOfMotionOfFreeRealScalarField})
and $div$ denotes the [[divergence]].
The equivalence to the equations on the right follows from using in the first first equation the derivative of the second equation
on the left, which is

$$
  b^{,\nu} = -\tfrac{1}{2} a^{\mu,\nu}{}_{,\mu}
  \,,
$$

and recalling the definition of the universal [[Faraday tensor]] (eq:FaradayTensorJet):

$$
  f^{\mu \nu}{}_{,\mu}
  =
  \tfrac{1}{2}
  \left(
    a^{\nu,\mu}{}_{,\mu}
    -
    a^{\mu,\nu}{}_{,\mu}
  \right)
  \,.
$$

The [[differential equations]] on the right are manifestly a system of [[normally hyperbolic differential operator|normally hyperbolic]] [[differential equations]], as opposed to the plain [[vacuum]] [[Maxwell equations]] on [[Minkowski spacetime]] $\frac{d}{d x^\mu} f^{\mu \nu} = 0$ (see also [Rejzner 16, section 7.2](Nakanishi-Lautrup+field#Rejzner16)).

Proposition \ref{NonTrivialImplicitInfinitesimalGaugeSymmetriesPbstructExistenceOfCauchySurfaces} implies
that we need a good handle on determining whether the space of implicit
[[infinitesimal gauge symmetries]] modulo trivial ones is non-zero. This
[[obstruction]] turns out to be neatly captured by methods of [[homological algebra]]
applied to the [[local BV-complex]] (def. \ref{BVComplexOfOrdinaryLagrangianDensity}):

+-- {: .num_example #InterpretationCohomologyOfBVComplex}
###### Example
**([[cochain cohomology]] of local [[BV-complex]])**

Let $(E,\mathbf{L})$ be a [[Lagrangian field theory]] (def. \ref{LocalLagrangianDensityOnSecondOrderJetBundleOfTrivialVectorBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime})
whose [[field bundle]] $E$ is a [[trivial vector bundle]] (example \ref{TrivialVectorBundleAsAFieldBundle}) and whose [[Lagrangian density]] $\mathbf{L}$ is spacetime-independent (example \ref{ShellForSpacetimeIndependentLagrangians}),
and let $\Sigma \times \{\varphi\} \hookrightarrow \mathcal{E}$ be a constant section of the shell (eq:ConstantSectionOfTrivialShellBundle).

By inspection we find that the [[cochain cohomology]] of the local [[BV-complex]]
$\Omega^{0,0}_{\Sigma,cp}(E,\varphi)\vert_{\mathcal{E}_{BV}}$ (def. \ref{BVComplexOfOrdinaryLagrangianDensity}) has the following interpretation:

In degree 0 the [[image]] of the [[BV-differential]] coming from degree -1 and modulo $d$-exact terms

$$
  im\left( \Gamma_{\Sigma,cp}(J^\infty_\Sigma T_\Sigma(E,\varphi)) \overset{s_{BV}}{\to} \Omega^{0,0}_\Sigma(E,\varphi)/im(d) \right)
$$

is the ideal of functions modulo $im(d)$ that vanish [[on-shell]]. Since the differential going _from_ degree 0 to degree 1 vanishes,
the [[cochain cohomology]] in this degree is the [[quotient ring]]

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    H^0\left(\Omega^{0,0}_{\Sigma,cp}(E,\varphi)\vert_{\mathcal{E}_{BV}}\vert d\right)
      & \simeq
    \Omega^{0,0}_{\Sigma,cp}(E,\varphi)\vert_{\mathcal{E}}/im(d)
  \end{aligned}
$$

of functions on the [[shell]] $\mathcal{E}$ (eq:ObservablesOnInfinitesimalNeighbourhoodOfZeroInShellInFieldFiber).

In degree -1 the [[kernel]] of the [[BV-differential]] going to degree 0

$$
  ker\left( \Gamma_{\Sigma,cp}(J^\infty_\Sigma T_\Sigma(E,\varphi)) \overset{s_{BV}}{\to} \Omega^{0,0}_\Sigma(E,\varphi)\right)
$$

is the space of implicit [[infinitesimal gauge symmetries]] (def. \ref{ImplicitInfinitesimalGaugeSymmetry})
and the [[image]] of the differential coming from degree -2

$$
  im\left(
    \Gamma_{\Sigma,cp}(J^\infty_\Sigma T_\Sigma E,\varphi)
       \wedge_{\Omega^{0,0}_{\Sigma,cp}(E,\varphi)}
    \Gamma_{\Sigma,cp}(J^\infty_\Sigma T_\Sigma E,\varphi)
      \overset{s_{BV}}{\longrightarrow}
    \Gamma_{\Sigma,cp}(J^\infty_\Sigma T_\Sigma E,\varphi)
  \right)
$$

is the trivial implicit infinitesimal gauge transformations (example \ref{TrivialImplicialInfinitesimalGaugeTransformations}).

Therefore the [[cochain cohomology]] in degree -1 is the [[quotient space]] of implicit infinitesimal gauge transformations
modulo the trivial ones:

$$
  \label{NegativeOneCohomologyBV}
  H^{-1}\left( \Omega^{0,0}_\Sigma(E,\varphi)\vert_{\mathcal{E}_{BV}} \right)

###### Proposition
**(local [[BV-complex]] is [[homological resolution]] of the [[shell]] precisely if there are no non-trivial implicit [[infinitesimal gauge symmetries]])**

Let $(E,\mathbf{L})$ be a [[Lagrangian field theory]] (def. \ref{LocalLagrangianDensityOnSecondOrderJetBundleOfTrivialVectorBundleOverMinkowskiSpacetime})
whose [[field bundle]] $E$ is a [[trivial vector bundle]] (example \ref{TrivialVectorBundleAsAFieldBundle}) and whose [[Lagrangian density]] $\mathbf{L}$ is spacetime-independent (example \ref{ShellForSpacetimeIndependentLagrangians})
and let $\Sigma \times \{\varphi\} \hookrightarrow \mathcal{E}$ be a constant section of the shell (eq:ConstantSectionOfTrivialShellBundle).
Furthermore assume that $\mathbf{L}$ is at least quadratic in the vertical coordinates around $\varphi$.

Then the local [[BV-complex]] $\Omega^{0,0}_\Sigma(E,\varphi)\vert_{\mathcal{E}_{BV}}$ of local observables (def. \ref{BVComplexOfOrdinaryLagrangianDensity}) is a [[homological resolution]] of the algebra of functions on the [[infinitesimal neighbourhood]] of $\varphi$ in the [[shell]] (example \ref{ShellForSpacetimeIndependentLagrangians}),
hence the canonical comparison morphisms (eq:ComparisonMorphismFromOrdinaryBVComplexToLocalObservables)
is a [[quasi-isomorphism]]
precisely if there is no non-trivial (example \ref{TrivialImplicialInfinitesimalGaugeTransformations}) implicit [[infinitesimal gauge symmetry]] (def. \ref{ImplicitInfinitesimalGaugeSymmetry}):

$$
  \left(
    \Omega^{0,0}_{\Sigma}(E,\varphi)\vert_{\mathcal{E}_{BV}}

  \;\Leftrightarrow\;
  \left(
    \array{
      \text{there are no non-trivial}
      \\
      \text{implicit infinitesimal gauge transformations}
    }
  \right)
  \,.
$$


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By example \ref{InterpretationCohomologyOfBVComplex} the vanishing of non-trivial implicit infinitesimal
gauge symmetries is equivalent to the vanishing of the cochain cohomology of the local BV-complex in degree -1 (eq:NegativeOneCohomologyBV).

Therefore the statement to be proven is
equivalently that the [[Koszul complex]] of the sequence of elements

$$
  \left(
    \frac{\delta_{EL} L}{\delta \phi^a} \in \Omega^{0,0}_{\Sigma,\varphi}(E)
  \right)_{a = 1}^s
$$

is a [[homological resolution]] of $\Omega^{0,0}_\Sigma(E,\varphi)\vert_{\mathcal{E}}$, hence has vanishing cohomology in all negative degrees,
already if it has vanishing cohomology in degree -1.

By a standard fact about [[Koszul complexes]] ([this prop.](Koszul+complex#KoszulResolutionForNoetherianRngAndElementsInJacobson))
a sufficient condition for this to be the case is that

1. the ring $\Omega^{0,0}_{\Sigma}(E,\varphi)$ is the tensor product of $C^\infty(\Sigma)$ with a [[Noetherian ring]];

1. the elements $\frac{\delta_{EL} L }{\delta \phi^a}$ are contained in its [[Jacobson radical]].

The first condition is the case since $\Omega^{0,0}_{\Sigma}(E,\varphi)$ is by definition a [[formal power series ring]] over a [[field]]
tensored with $C^\infty(\Sigma)$
(by [this example](noetherian+ring#PolynomialAlgebraOverNoetherianRingIsNoetherian)).
Since the Jacobson radical of a power series algebra consists of those elements whose constant term
vanishes (see [this example](Koszul+complex#KoszulComplexForFormalPowerSeriesAlgebras)),
the assumption that $\mathbf{L}$ is at least quadratic, hence that $\delta_{EL}\mathbf{L}$
is at least linear in the fields, guarantees that all $\frac{\delta_{EL}L}{\delta \phi^a}$ are contained
in the Jacobson radical.

=--

Prop. \ref{BVComplexIsHomologicalResolutionPreciselyIfNoNonTrivialImplicitGaugeSymmetres}
says what [[gauge fixing]] has to accomplish: given a [[local BV-BRST complex]] we need
to find a [[quasi-isomorphism]] to another complex which is such that it comes from a
_graded_ Lagrangian density whose BV-cohomology vanishes in degree -1
and hence induces a graded covariant phase space, and such that
the remaining BRST differential respects the Poisson bracket on this graded covariant phase space.
