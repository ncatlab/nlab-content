[[!redirects Stable homotopy and generalized homology]]

This page collects links related to

* [[John Frank Adams]], 

  _Stable homotopy and generalized homology_, 

  Chicago Lectures in mathematics, 1974


on [[complex cobordism cohomology theory|complex]] [[cobordism theory]], [[complex oriented cohomology theory]], and the [[Adams spectral sequence]]/[[Adams-Novikov spectral sequence]].

The big story emerging here was later further developed in

* [[Mike Hopkins]], _[[Complex oriented cohomology theories and the language of stacks]]_, 1999

* [[Jacob Lurie]], _[[Chromatic Homotopy Theory]]_, 2010

This is about understanding the absolute base space [[Spec(S)]] by [[covering]] it with Spec([[MU]]). See at _[Adams spectral sequences -- As derived descent](Adams%20spectral%20sequence#DefinitionInHigherAlgebra)_.
