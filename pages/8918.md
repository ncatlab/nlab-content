## Idea

In the context of [[T-duality]] and in particular of [[differential T-duality]] one considers (as discussed in detail there) [[fiber products]] of two [[torus]]-[[fiber bundles]] together with a [[circle 2-bundle]] on this, ([[circle n-bundle with connection|with connection]]). 

In some disguise, this has been called _$B_n$-geometry_ ([Baraglia](#Baraglia)). The T-duality interpretation is made explicit in [Bouwknegt](Bouwknegt)

Here "$B_n$" refers to the [[special orthogonal group]] of the form $SO(n+1,n)$, which appears as the structure group of a [[generalized tangent bundle]] tensored with a [[line bundle]] (the [[Poincare line bundle]] of the T-duality correspondence).

## Properties

### Interpretation in higher differential geometry

We give the interpretation of $B_n$-geometry in [[smooth infinity-groupoid|higher differential geometry]].

For $c_{conn},c'_{conn} \colon X \to \mathbf{B}U(1)$ modulating two circle principal bundles with conection, a [[differential T-duality]] structure is a choice of trivialization of their [[cup product]] class. From this we get the [[pasting diagram]] of [[homotopy pullbacks]] of smooth $\infty$-stacks

$$
  \array{
    P \times_X \hat P&\stackrel{\tau}{\to}& \mathbf{B}^2 U(1) &\to& *
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    X 
     &\to& 
    fib(\cup) 
     &\to& 
    (\mathbf{B}U(1)) \times (\mathbf{B}U(1))
    \\
    &\searrow & \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\cup}}
    \\
    && * &\to& \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)
  }
  \,.
$$

Here $\tau$ is the morphism that modulates the circle 2-bundle on the fiber product of the two circle bundles.
