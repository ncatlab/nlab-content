## Idea

A _operation tangent space_ of a [[generalized smooth space]] at some point is given by the [[derivations]] of the [[algebra of functions|algebra]] of [[smooth functions]]. This generalizes the notion of [[tangent space]] of a [[differentiable manifold]]. The alternative notion is that of the [[kinematic tangent space]], which for differentiable manifolds coincides, but more generally need not.
