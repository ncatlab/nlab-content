## Idea

To define the [[tangent space]] of a [[smooth manifold]], one may equivalently use [[curves]] or [[derivations]] of the [[algebra of functions|algebra]] of [[smooth functions]].  For more general [[smooth spaces]], these are no longer equivalent.

The _operational tangent space_ of a [[generalized smooth space]] (at some point $c$) is the space of [[derivations]] of the [[algebra of functions|algebra]] of [[germs]] (at $c$) of [[smooth functions]].

The alternative notion (using curves) is that of the [[kinematic tangent space]].
