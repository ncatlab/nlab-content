The __enveloping von Neumann algebra__ of a $C^*$-[[C-star algebra|algebra]] $A$ is the closure, in the [[weak operator topology]], of the image $\pi(A)$ of the [[universal representation of a C-star algebra|universal representation]] $\pi : A\to B(H)$ (which is, by the definition, the direct sum of [[GNS representation]]s of all [[positive functional|positive]] linear functionals)
in $B(H)$.
