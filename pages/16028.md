

This entry is going to become an exposition to the topics of 

1. [[Cartan geometry]], 

1. higher dimensional [[supergravity]] 

1. the [[brane scan]] 

and an indication of how these all naturally flow out of a common source when considered in [[higher differential geometry|higher differential]] [[supergeometry]].

> However, for the time being this entry is under construction and mostly non-existent.  Nothing to be seen here yet, please move to another entry.
