## Idea

The notion of _[[quantum field theory]]_ exists without reference to any predefined notion of _[[configuration space]]_ of _[[quantum fields]]_, _[[action functional]]_, _[[phase space]]_ etc.: 

A [[quantum field theory]] in [[FQFT]]-[[axiomatization]] is simply a consistent assignment of [[spaces of quantum states]], whereas in [[AQFT]]-[[axiomatization]] it is a consistent assignment of [[algebras of quantum observables]], and that's it. 

However, most (or maybe all?) quantum field theories of interest in actual [[physics]] (as opposed to as devices of pure [[mathematics]]) are not random models of these axioms, but do arise under a process called [[quantization]] from a ([[local Lagrangian|local]]/[[extended Lagrangian|extended]]) [[Lagrangian]], hence from an [[action functional]], defined on a [[configuration space]] of [[quantum fields]], or else arise as [[holographic duals]] of quantum field theories that arise by quantization. Moreover, the extra information provided by the Lagrangian is commonly used (and is maybe strictly necessary) to interpret the mathematical structure of the axiomatic QFT in actual [[physics]] (though notably in [[AQFT]] there are results that re-extract at least parts of this data from the axiomatic QFT, for instance the [[Doplicher-Roberts reconstruction theorem]] which extract the [[global gauge group]] from the [[local net of quantum observables]]).

There are in turn two formalizations of the notion of [[quantization]]: _algebraic [[deformation quantization]]_ and _[[geometric quantization]]_. In the latter one speaks of _[[prequantization]]_ when referring to a precursor step to the actual quantization step, in which the [[symplectic form]] on [[phase space]] is lifted from to [[differential cohomology]], hence to a [[prequantum bundle]]. But in the context of [[higher geometry]] and [[higher geometric quantization]] this prequantization step is already part of the data of the [[Lagrangian]] itself: an [[extended Lagrangian]] already encodes not just the [[action functional]] but also the [[prequantum bundle]] and all the [[prequantum n-bundle|prequantum (n-k)-bundles]] in each [[dimension]] $k$. The action functional itself is the _[[prequantum 0-bundle]]_  in this context.

Therefore, in the refined picture of [[higher geometry]]/[[extended quantum field theory]] it makes good sense to refer in a unified way to **prequantum field theory** for all of the data related to [[Lagrangians]] that is not yet the final [[quantum field theory]]. 

In particular, an **extended prequantum field theory** of [[dimension]] $n$ is a rule that assigns

* to every (suitably [[orientation|oriented]]) [[closed manifold]] of [[dimension]] $k$ a [[prequantum n-bundle|prequantum (n-k)-bundle]]

* to every (suitably [[orientation|oriented]]) [[compact topological space|compact]] [[manifold with boundary]] $\Sigma_k$ a [[section]] of the prequantum $(n-k+1)$-bundle assigned to the [[boundary]] $\partial \Sigma_k$ and pulled back to the space of fields over $\Sigma_k$

such that this data is related suitably under [[transgression]].

The actual [[extended quantum field theory]] would be obtained from such a data by passing from the assignment of a given prequantum $(n-k)$-bundle to that of the [[n-vector space|(n-k)-vector space]] of [[polarization|polarized]] [[sections]] of a suitable [[associated infinity-bundle|associated]] [[fiber infinity-bundle|fiber bundle]].

This is summarized in the following table:

[[!include extended prequantum field theory - table]]

## Details

> under construction

We discuss local ("[[extended TQFT|extended]]") [[topological field theory|topological]] prequantum field theory. 

The following originates in the lecture notes ([Schreiber Pittsburgh13](#SchreiberPittLectures)) and draws on material that is discussed more fully in ([Fiorenza-Valentino](#FiorenzaValentino)) and ([Fiorenza-Schreiber](#FiorenzaSchreiber)).

After a technical prelimiray to set the stage in 

* _[The ambient topos](#TheTopos)_,

the first section gives the the definitions and general properties of 

* _[Local prequantum field theory](#LocalPrequantumFieldTheory)_.

To digest this the reader may first or in parallel want to look at the simplest examples of these general considerations, which we discuss below in the first subsections of

* _[Higher Dijkgraaf-Witten prequantum field theory](#HigherDijkgraafWittenLocalPrequantumFieldTheory)_.

After that we turn to the general case of examples of 

* _[Higher Chern-Simons prequantum field theory](#HigherChern-SimonsLocalPrequantumFieldTheory)_.

### The ambient topos
 {#TheTopos}

Prequantum field theory deals with "spaces of [[field (physics)|physical fields]]". These spaces of [[field (physics)|fields]] are, in general, richer than just plain [[sets]] in two ways

1. Spaces of [[field (physics)|fields]] carry [[geometry|geometric]] structure, notably they may be [[smooth spaces]], meaning that there is a way to determine which collections of [[field (physics)|fields]] form a smoothly parameterized collection. This is for instance the structure invoked (often implicitly) when performing [[variational calculus]] on spaces of [[field (physics)|fields]] in order to find their classical [[equations of motion]]. 

1. Spaces of fields have [[gauge transformations]] between their points and possibly [[higher gauge transformations]] between these, meaning that they are in fact [[groupoids]] and possibly [[infinity-groupoid|higher groupoids]]. In the physics literature this is best known in the [[infinitesimal object|infinitesimal]] approximation to these gauge transformations, in which case the spaces of fields are described by [[BRST complexes]]: the dg-algebras of functions on a [[Lie algebroid]] or [[L-∞ algebroid]] of fields.

Taken together this means that spaces of fields are _[[(∞,1)-sheaf|geometric higher groupoids]]_, such as [[orbifolds]] and more generally [[Lie groupoids]], [[differentiable stacks]], [[Lie 2-groupoids]], ... [[smooth ∞-groupoids]].

A collection of all such geometric higher groupoids for a chosen flavor of [[geometry]] -- for instance [[topology]] or [[differential geometry]] or  [[supergeometry]] (for the description of [[fermion]] fields) or [[synthetic differential geometry]] or [[synthetic differential supergeometry]], etc. -- is called an _[[∞-topos]]_. 

Not quite every [[∞-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$ serves as a decent context for collectiojns (moduli stacks) of [[physical fields]] though. In the following we need at least that $\mathbf{H}$ has a reasonable notion of _[[discrete objects]]_ so that we can identify the geometrically discrete spaces in there. We here need this to mean the following

+-- {: .num_defn #ShapeAndFlatModality}
###### Definition

An [[∞-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$ is called _[[locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos|locally ∞-connected]]_ and _[[globally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos|globally ∞-connetced]]_ if the [[locally constant ∞-stack]]-functor $LConst \colon $ [[∞Grpd]] $\to \mathbf{H}$ is a [[reflective sub-(∞,1)-category|reflective embedding]]. 

The corresponding reflector we write

$$
  \Pi \colon \mathbf{H} \to \infty Grpd \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H}
$$

and also call the _[[shape modality]]_ of $\mathbf{H}$. By the discussion at [[adjoint triple]] it follows that $LConst$ is also a [[coreflective subcategory|coreflective]] embedding; the corresponding coreflector we write 

$$
  \flat \colon \mathbf{H} \stackrel{\Gamma}{\to} \infty Grpd \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H}
$$

and call the _[[flat modality]]_.

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

Every [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] is in particular globally and locally $\infty$-connected, by definition. Standard anonical exmaples to keep in mind are

* $\mathbf{H} = $ [[∞Grpd]] for [[∞-Dijkgraaf-Witten theories]];

* $\mathbf{H} = $ [[Smooth∞Grpd]] for [[schreiber:∞-Chern-Simons theories]];

* $\mathbf{H} = $ [[SuperSmooth∞Grpd]] for [[schreiber:∞-Chern-Simons theories]] with [[fermions]] and [[supersymmetry]];

* $\mathbf{H} = $ [[SynthDiff∞Grpd]] for [[AKSZ sigma-models]].

### Local prequantum field theory
 {#LocalPrequantumFieldTheory}

After sketching out the general 

* _[Idea](#PrequantumFieldTheoryIdea)_

we formulate first 

* _[Bulk field theory](#BulkFieldTheory)_,

which concerns the case where the [[worldvolume]]/[[spacetime]] on which the [[field (physics)|physical fields]] propagate has no [[boundaries]] with [[boundary conditions]] imposed (no "[[branes]]" or "[[domain walls]]" or "[[QFT with defects|defects]]"). The point of this section is to see how the "space of fields" -- or rather: the [[moduli stack]] of fields -- on a point induces the corresponding spaces/moduli stacks of fields on an arbitrary [[closed manifold]], and, correspondingly, how the [[prequantum n-bundle]] on the space over fields over the point induces the [[action functional]] in [[codimension]] 0.

However, what makes local prequantum field theory rich is that it naturally incorporates extra structure on [[boundaries]] of [[worldvolume]]/[[spacetime]]. In fact, under suitable conditions there is another local prequantum field theory just over the boundary, which is related to the corresponding bulk field theory possibly by a kind of [[holographic principle]]. This general mechanism we discuss in 

* _[Boundary field theory](#BoundaryFieldTheory)_.

But plain boundaries are just the first example of a general phenomenon known as "[[QFT with defects|defects]]" or "phase dualities" or "singularities" in field theories. Notably the boundary field theory itself may have boundaries, in which case this means that the original theory had _[[manifold with corners|corners]]_ where different boundary pieces meet. This we discuss in 

* _[Corner field theory](#CornerFieldTheory)

Generally there are fields theories with general such singularties:

[[!include field theory with boundaries and defects - table]]


#### Idea
 {#PrequantumFieldTheoryIdea}

A _prequantum field theory_ is, at its heart, an assignment that sends a piece of [[worldvolume]]/[[spacetime]] $\Sigma$ -- technically a [[cobordism]] with [[boundary]] and [[corners]] -- to the 

1. [[space]] of [[physical field|field configurations]] over incoming and outgoing pieces of worldvolume/spacetime;

1. the space of field configurations over the bulk worldvolume/spacetime -- the [[trajectories]] of fields;

1. an [[action functional]] that assigns to all these field configurations [[phases]] in a compatible manner. 

These field configurations and spaces of [[trajectories]] between them are represented by [[spans]]/[[correspondences]] of ([[moduli space|moduli]]-)spaces of fields ([[moduli stacks]], really), hence [[diagrams]] of the form

$$
  \mathbf{Fields}_{in}
  \leftarrow
  \mathbf{Fields}
  \rightarrow
  \mathbf{Fields}_{out}
  \,.
$$

Here $\mathbf{Fields}_{in}$ is to be thought of as the space of incoming fields, $\mathbf{Fields}_{out}$ that of outgoing fields, and $\mathbf{Fields}$ the space of all fields on some [[cobordism]] connecting the incoming and the outgoing pieces of [[worldvolume]]/[[spacetime]]. The left map sends such a trajectory to its starting configuration, and the right one sends it to its end configuration.

Given two such spans/corespondences, that share a common field configuration as in 

$$
  \array{
    && \mathbf{Fields}_1 && && \mathbf{Fields}_2
    \\
    & \swarrow && \searrow && \swarrow && \searrow
    \\
    \mathbf{Fields}_{in_1}
    && &&
    \mathbf{Fields}_{out_1} = \mathbf{Fields}_{in_2}
    && &&
    \mathbf{Fields}_{out_2}
  }
$$ 

can be [[composition|composed]], by forming consecutive trajectories from all pairs of trajectories that mathch in the middle. The space of these composed trajectories is the [[fiber product]] 
$\mathbf{Fields}_1 \underset{{\mathbf{Fields}_{out_1}} \atop {=\mathbf{Fields}_{in_2}}}{\times} \mathbf{Fields}_2$ which sits in a new [[span]]/[[correspondence]]

$$
  \mathbf{Fields}_{in_1}
  \leftarrow
  \mathbf{Fields}_1 \underset{{\mathbf{Fields}_{out_1}} \atop {=\mathbf{Fields}_{in_2}}}{\times} \mathbf{Fields}_2
  \rightarrow
  \mathbf{Fields}_{out_2}
$$

exhibiting the composite of the previous two. This way, spaces of fields with spans/correspondences between them form a [[category]], which we denote $Span_1(\mathbf{H})$ if $\mathbf{H}$ denotes the ambient context (a [[topos]]) in which the spaces of fields live. 

If two cobordisms run in parallel, then the fiedl configurations on their union are pairs of the original field configurations, which are elements in the [[cartesian product]] of spaces of fields. Hence the operations

$$
  \left(
  \mathbf{Fields}_{in}
  \leftarrow
  \mathbf{Fields}
  \rightarrow
  \mathbf{Fields}_{out}
  \right)
  \otimes
  \left(
  \tilde \mathbf{Fields}_{in}
  \leftarrow
  \tilde \mathbf{Fields}
  \rightarrow
  \tilde\mathbf{Fields}_{out}
  \right)  
  \;\;\coloneqq\;\;
  \left(
    \mathbf{Fields}_{in} \times \tilde\mathbf{Fields}_{in}
    \leftarrow
    \mathbf{Fields} \times \tilde\mathbf{Fields}
    \to
    \mathbf{Fields}_{out} \times \tilde\mathbf{Fields}_{out}    
  \right)
$$

make this category of fields and corespondence into a [[monoidal category]]. 

Then a choice of field configurations for a (not yet localized) field theory in dimension $n \in \mathbb{N}$ is a [[monoidal functor]] from a [[category of cobordisms]] of dimension $n$ to such a category of [[spans]]/[[correspondences]]

$$
  \mathbf{Fields} \colon Bord_n^\otimes \to Span_1(\mathbf{H})^\otimes
  \,,
$$

namely a consistend assignment that to each [[closed manifold]] $\Sigma_{n-1}$ of dimension $(n-1)$ assigns a space of field configurations $\mathbf{Fields}(\Sigma_{n-1})$ and which two each [[cobordism]]

$$
  \Sigma_{in} \to \Sigma \leftarrow \Sigma_{out}
$$

assigns a [[span]]/[[correspondence]] of spaces of field configurations and trajectories

$$
  \mathbf{Fields}(\Sigma_{in})
  \leftarrow
  \mathbf{Fields}(\Sigma)
  \rightarrow
  \mathbf{Fields}_{\Sigma_{out}}
  \,.
$$

Apart from the field configurations themselves, prequantum field theory assigns to each [[trajectory]] a "[[phase]]" -- an element in the [[circle group]] $U(1)$ -- by a map called the (exponentiated) [[action functional]]. In order to nicely relate that to the expression of spaces of trajectories as [[spans]]/[[correspondences]] as above, it is useful to think of the [[circle group]] here as being the [[automorphisms]] of something. This is universally accomplished by taking it to be the automorphsims of the unique point in the [[delooping]] [[groupoid]] $\mathbf{B}U(1) = \{\ast \stackrel{c \in U(1)}{\to} \ast\}$. (A lightning review of [[groupoid]]-[[homotopy theory]] is below in [Groupoids and basic homotopy 1-type theory](#GroupoidsAndBasicHomotopy1TypeTheory)). In other words, we think of the group of phases $U(1)$ as the space of [[homotopies]] from the point to itself in the [[Eilenberg-MacLane space]] $\mathbf{B}U(1)$, expressed by the [[diagram]] (a [[homotopy fiber product]] diagram)

$$
  \array{
    && U(1)
    \\
    & \swarrow && \searrow
    \\
    \ast && \swArrow && \ast 
    \\
    & \searrow && \swarrow
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}U(1)
  }
  \,.
$$

Using this, if we assume for simplicity that the in- and outgoing field configurations are sent constantly to the point in $\mathbf{B}U(1)$, then an (exponentiated) [[action functional]] on the space of trajectories $\exp(i S) \colon \mathbf{Fields} \to U(1)$ is equivalently a [[homotopy]] as shown on the left of the following diagram

$$
  \array{
    && \mathbf{Fields}
    \\
    & \swarrow && \searrow
    \\
    \mathbf{Fields}_{in}
    && \swArrow &&
    \mathbf{Fields}_{out}
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{0}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{0}}
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}U(1)
  }
  \;\;\;\;
  \simeq
  \;\;\;\;
  \array{
    && \mathbf{Fields}
    \\
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\exp(i S)}}
    \\
    && U(1)
    \\
    & \swarrow && \searrow
    \\
    \ast && \swArrow && \ast
    \\
    & \searrow && \swarrow
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}U(1)
  }
  \,.
$$

Hence action functioals are naturally incorporated into [[spans]]/[[correspondences]] of [[moduli spaces]] of fields simply by regarding these to be formed not in the ambient [[topos]] $\mathbf{H}$ itself, but in its [[slice topos]] $\mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}U(1)}$, where each object is equipped with a map to $\mathbf{B}U(1)$ and each morphism with a [[homotopy]] in $\mathbf{B}U(1)$ between the corresponding maps.

We write $\mathrm{Span}_1(\mathbf{H}, \mathbf{B}U(1))$ for the category of spans/correspondences as before, but now equipped with maps to and transformations over $\mathbf{B}U(1)$ as in the above diagram. 

Then an [[action functional]] for a choice of field configurations that itself is given as a [[monoidal functor]] $\mathbf{Fields} \colon Bord_n^\otimes \to Span_1(\mathbf{H})$ as above is a monoidal functor

$$
  S \colon Bord_n^\otimes \to Span_1(\mathbf{H}, \mathbf{B}U(1))
$$

such that the spans of spaces of fields are those specified before, hence such that it fits as a lift into the diagram

$$
  \array{
     && Span_1(\mathbf{H}, \mathbf{B}U(1))
     \\
     & {}^{\mathllap{S}}\nearrow & \downarrow 
     \\
     Bord_n &\underset{\mathbf{Fields}}{\to}& Span_1(\mathbf{H})
  }
  \,,
$$

where the right vertical functor [[forgetful functor|forgets]] the phase assignsments and just remembers the correspondences of field trajectories.


So far this is a non-local (or: not-neccessarily local) preqauntum field theory, since it assigns data only to entire $n$-dimensional cobordisms and $(n-1)$-dimensional [[closed manifolds]], but is not guaranteed to be obtained by integrating up local data over little pieces of these manifolds. The latter possibility is however the characteristic property of [[local quantum field theory]], which in turn is the flavor of quantum field theory that seems to matter in nature, and fundamentally.

In order to formaliz this localization, we allow the cobordisms to contain higher-[[codimension]] pieces that are [[manifolds with corners]]. These then form not just a [[category of cobordisms]], but an [[(∞,n)-category]] of cobordisms, which we will still denote $Bord_n^\otimes$. If we now have a cobordism with [[codimension]]-2 [[corners]], then the field configurations over it now form a span-of-spans

$$
  \array{
    \mathbf{Fields}_{ii} &\leftarrow& \mathbf{Fields}_{ic} &\to& \mathbf{Fields}_{io}
    \\
    \uparrow && \uparrow && \uparrow
    \\
    \mathbf{Fields}_{ci} &\leftarrow& \mathbf{Fields}_{cc} &\to& \mathbf{Fields}_{co}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbf{Fields}_{oi} &\leftarrow& \mathbf{Fields}_{oc} &\to& \mathbf{Fields}_{oo}
  }
  \,.
$$

Generally, for $n$-dimensional cobordism that are "localized" all the way to [[corners]] in codimension $n$, their field configurations and trajectories-of-trajectories etc. form $n$-dimensional cubes of spans-of-spans this way. We write $Span_n(\mathbf{H})$ for the resulting [[(∞,n)-category of spans]].

In order to still have an [[action functional]] on trajectories is [[codimension]]-0 associated with this in the above fashion, we need to [[delooping|deloop]] $U(1)$ $n$-times to the [[n-groupoid]] $\mathbf{B}^n U(1)$ (the [[circle n-group|circle (n+1)-group]]). Accordingly a local prequantum field theory in dimension $n$ is given by a [[monoidal (∞,n)-functor]]

$$
  S \colon Bord_n^\otimes \to Span_n(\mathbf{H}, \mathbf{B}^n U(1))
  \,.
$$

The point of local topological (prequantum) field theory is that by the [[cobordism theorem]] the above story reverses: the assignment of fields and their action functional in higher dimension is necessarily given by [[higher traces]] of the data assigned in lower dimension. Hence the whole assignment $S$ above is fixed by its value on the point, hence by a choice of one single map

$$
  \left[
    \array{
      \mathbf{Fields}(\ast)
      \\
      \downarrow^\mathrlap{S}
      \\
      \mathbf{B}U(1)
    }
  \right]
  \,,
$$

the fully localized action functional. Or rather, this is the case for pure bulk field theory, with no [[branes]] or [[domain walls]]. If these are present, then each type of them in dimension $k$ is specified by a [[k-morphism]] in $Span_n(\mathbf{H}, \mathbf{B}^n U(1))$.

All this we now describe more formally.

#### Bulk field theory
 {#BulkFieldTheory}

We now first consider the formalization of prequantum field theory
in the absence of any data such as [[boundary conditions]], [[domain walls]], [[branes]], [[QFT with defects|defects]], etc. This describes either field theories in which no such phenomena are taken to be present, or else it describes that part of those field theories where such phenomena are present in principle, but restricted to the "[[bulk]]" of [[worldvolume]]/[[spacetime]] where they are not. Therefore it makes sense to speak of _bulk field theory_ in this case.

In this notation we have an identification

###### Remark

The [[cobordism theorem]] asserts, essentially, that $Bord_n$ is the [[symmetric monoidal (∞,n)-category]] with [[fully dualizable objects|full duals]] which is [[free construction|free]] on a single generator, the point. In itself this is a deep statement about the [[homotopy type]] of [[categories of cobordisms]]. But for the following discussion the reader may just take this as the _definition_ of $Bord_n$. This then makes $Bord_n$ a very simple object, as long as we are just mapping out of it, which we do.

What this means then is that a [[monoidal (∞,n)-functor]] 

$$
  Z \colon Bord_n^\otimes \to \mathcal{C}^\otimes
$$

sends the point to some [[fully dualizable object]] $Z(\ast) \in \mathcal{C}$ and sends

* the [[circle]] $S^1$ to the [[trace]] of the identity on $Z(\ast)$, 

* the [[sphere]] $S^2$ to the 2-dimensional [[higher trace]] of the identity,

###### Remark

Since the [[slice (∞,1)-category]] $\mathbf{H}_{/\flat \mathbf{B}^n U(1)}$ is itself an [[(∞,1)-topos]] -- the [[slice (∞,1)-topos]] -- we also have $Span_n(\mathbf{H}_{/\flat \mathbf{B}^n U(1)})$, according to def. \ref{CorrespondencesInInfinityTopos}. As an [[(∞,n)-category]] this is equivalent to $Span_n(\mathbf{H}, \flat \mathbf{B}^n U(1))$ from def. \ref{CorrespondencesOverB}, but the [[monoidal (∞,n)-category|monoidal structure]] is different. The [[cartesian product]] in the slice is given by [[homotopy fiber product]] in $\mathbf{H}$ over $\flat \mathbf{B}^n U(1)$, not by the addition in the [[∞-group]] structure on $\flat \mathbf{B}^n U(1)$, as in def. \ref{CorrespondencesOverB}.

###### Definition

A **local prequantum bulk [[field (physics)|field]]** in [[dimension]] $n \in \mathbb{N}$ (in a given ambient [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$) is a [[monoidal (∞,n)-functor]]

from the [[(∞,n)-category of cobordisms]] (with [[G-structure|S-structure]]), def. \ref{nCategoryOfCobordisms}, to the [[(∞,n)-category of n-fold correspondences]] in $\mathbf{H}$.

A **local action functional** on such a local prequantum bulk [[field (physics)|field]] is a monoidal lift $S$ of this in

Since a monoidal $(\infty,n)$-functor $\mathbf{Fields} \colon Bord_n \to Span_n(\mathbf{H})$ is determined by its value on the point, we will often notationally identify it with this value and write

$$
  \mathbf{Fields} = \mathbf{Fields}(\ast) \in \mathbf{H} \hookrightarrow Span_n(\mathbf{H})

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Given $\mathbf{Fields} \colon Bord_n^\otimes \to Span_n(\mathbf{H})^\otimes$, it assigns to a [[k-morphism]] represented by a [[closed manifold]] $\Sigma_k$ the [[internal hom]] ([[mapping stack]]) from  $\Pi(\Sigma_k)$ (the [[shape modality]] of $\Sigma_k$, def. \ref{ShapeAndFlatModality}) into the moduli stack of fields

$$

  \Sigma_k
  \mapsto
  [\Pi(\Sigma_k), \mathbf{Fields}]
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

By the defining property of the [[mapping stack]] construction, this means that if $\mathcal{C}$ is an [[(∞,1)-site]] of definition of the [[(∞,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$, then $[\Pi(\Sigma_k), \mathbf{Fields}]$ is the [[∞-stack]] which to $U \in \mathcal{C}$ assigns the [[(∞,1)-categorical hom space]]

$$
  [\Pi(\Sigma_k), \mathbf{Fields}](U) \simeq
  \mathbf{H}(\Pi(\Sigma_k)\times U , \mathbf{Fields})
  \,,
$$

hence the [[∞-groupoid]] of fields on $\Pi(\Sigma_k) \times U$. 

If $\mathbf{Fields}$ is a [[moduli ∞-stack]] of [[gauge fields]] for some [[smooth ∞-group]] $G$, hence of the form $\mathbf{B}G_{conn}$, then this an $\infty$-groupoid of a kind of smoothly (or else geometrically) $U$-parameterized collections of [[flat ∞-connections]] on $\Sigma_k$.

[[Dijkgraaf-Witten theory]] in [[dimension]] 1 is what results when one regards a [[group character]] of a [[finite group]] $G$ as an 
[[action functional]] in 
the sense of def. \ref{LocalPrequantumFieldTheory}.
We give an expository discussion of this example and in the course of it
introduce some basics of the [[homotopy theory]] of [[groupoids]] ([[homotopy 1-types]]).

1. [Finite gauge groups](#FiniteGaugeGroups)

1. [Groupoids and basic homotopy 1-type theory](#GroupoidsAndBasicHomotopy1TypeTheory) 

1. [Correspondences of groupoids](#CorrespondencesOfGroupoids)

1. [1d DW local field theory](#1dDWLocalFieldTheory)


##### Finite gauge groups
 {#FiniteGaugeGroups} 


A [[group character]] on a [[finite group]] $G$ is just a [[group]] [[homomorphism]] $G \to U(1)$ to the [[circle group]] (regarded here as a [[discrete group]]).
In order to regard this as an [[action functional]], 
we are to take $G$ as the 
[[gauge group]] of a physical field theory. The simplest
such case is a field theory such that on the point there is 
just a single possible field configuration, to be denoted $\phi_0$.
The reader familiar with basics of traditional [[gauge theory]] may think of the fields as being 
[[gauge field]] [[connections]] ("[[vector potentials]]"), hence represented by  [[differential 1-forms]]. But on the point there is only the vanishing 1-form, hence just a single field configuration $\phi_0$.

Even though there is just a single such field, that $G$ is the [[gauge group]] means that for each [[element]] $g \in G$ there is a 
[[gauge transformation]] that takes
$\phi_0$ to itself, a state of affairs which we suggestively denote by the symbols
$$
  \phi_0 \stackrel{g}{\to}  \phi_0
  \,.
$$

Again, the reader familiar with 
traditional [[gauge theory]] may think of [[gauge transformations]] as in [[Yang-Mills theory]]. Over the point these form, indeed, just the [[gauge group]] itself, taking the trivial field configuration to itself.

That the [[gauge group]] is indeed a [[group]] means that gauge transformations can be  applied consecutively, which we express in symbols as

$$
  \array{
    && \phi_0
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{g_1}}\nearrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{g_2}}
    \\
    \phi_0 && \underset{g_2 \cdot g_1}{\to} && \phi_0
  }
  \,.
$$

Regarded this way, we say the [gauge group acting on the single field $\phi_0$ forms a _[[groupoid]]_, whose single _[[object]]_ is $\phi_0$ and whose set of _[[morphisms]]_ is $G$.

* $(\mathbf{B}G)_0 = \ast$;

* $(\mathbf{B}G)_1 = G$.

For $G$ and $K$ two groups, group homomorphisms $G \to K$
are in [[natural bijection]] with groupoid homomorphisms
$(\mathbf{B}G)_\bullet \to (\mathbf{B}K)_\bullet$. In 
particular a [[group character]] for $G$ is equivalently a groupoid homomorphism

$$

Here, for the time being, all groups are [[discrete groups]]. Since the [[circle group]] $U(1)$ also has a standard structure of a [[Lie group]], and since later for the discussion of Chern-Simons type theories this will be relevant, we will write from now on

$$

 The statement of prop. \ref{DiscreteGroupoidIsDijointUnioonOfDeloopings}

 while for nontrivial geometry there are genuine groupoid theories, 
 for instance the [[AKSZ sigma-models]]. But even so,

  $$

=--

###### Proof

Notice that $\Pi_1(S^0) \simeq \ast \coprod \ast$. Therefore
the [[path space object]] $[\Pi(S^0), X_\bullet]^I_\bullet$ has

* objects are pairs of morphisms in $X_\bullet$;

* morphisms are commuting squares of such.

Now the fiber product in def. \ref{HomotopyFiberProductOfGroupoids}
picks in there those pairs of morphisms for which both start at the same object, and both end at the same object. Therefore $X_\bullet \underset{[\Pi(S^0), X_\bullet]_\bullet}{\times} [\Pi(S^0), X_\bullet]^I_\bullet \underset{[\Pi(S^0), X_\bullet]_\bullet}{\times} X$ is the groupoid whose

* objects are diagrams in $X_\bullet$ of the form 

  $$
    \array{
       & \nearrow \searrow
       \\
       x_0 && x_1
       \\
       & \searrow \nearrow
    }
  $$

* morphism are cylinder-diagrams over these.

One finds along the lines of example 
\ref{BZIsPiSOne} that this is equivalent to maps from $\Pi_1(S^1)$ into $X_\bullet$ and homotopies between these.

Even though all these models of the circle $\Pi_1(S^1)$ are equivalent,
below the special appearance of the circle in the proof of

As we see in a moment, this is the natural way in which the circle
