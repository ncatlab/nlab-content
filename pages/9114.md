## Idea

The notion of _[[quantum field theory]]_ exists without reference to any predefined notion of _[[configuration space]]_ of _[[quantum fields]]_, _[[action functional]]_, _[[phase space]]_ etc.: 

A [[quantum field theory]] in [[FQFT]]-[[axiomatization]] is simply a consistent assignment of [[spaces of quantum states]], whereas in [[AQFT]]-[[axiomatization]] it is a consistent assignment of [[algebras of quantum observables]], and that's it. 

However, most (or maybe all?) quantum field theories of interest in actual [[physics]] (as opposed to as devices of pure [[mathematics]]) are not random models of these axioms, but do arise under a process called [[quantization]] from a ([[local Lagrangian|local]]/[[extended Lagrangian|extended]]) [[Lagrangian]], hence from an [[action functional]], defined on a [[configuration space]] of [[quantum fields]], or else arise as [[holographic duals]] of quantum field theories that arise by quantization. Moreover, the extra information provided by the Lagrangian is commonly used (and is maybe strictly necessary) to interpret the mathematical structure of the axiomatic QFT in actual [[physics]] (though notably in [[AQFT]] there are results that re-extract at least parts of this data from the axiomatic QFT, for instance the [[Doplicher-Roberts reconstruction theorem]] which extract the [[global gauge group]] from the [[local net of quantum observables]]).

There are in turn two formalizations of the notion of [[quantization]]: _algebraic [[deformation quantization]]_ and _[[geometric quantization]]_. In the latter one speaks of _[[prequantization]]_ when referring to a precursor step to the actual quantization step, in which the [[symplectic form]] on [[phase space]] is lifted from to [[differential cohomology]], hence to a [[prequantum bundle]]. But in the context of [[higher geometry]] and [[higher geometric quantization]] this prequantization step is already part of the data of the [[Lagrangian]] itself: an [[extended Lagrangian]] already encodes not just the [[action functional]] but also the [[prequantum bundle]] and all the [[prequantum n-bundle|prequantum (n-k)-bundles]] in each [[dimension]] $k$. The action functional itself is the _[[prequantum 0-bundle]]_  in this context.

Therefore, in the refined picture of [[higher geometry]]/[[extended quantum field theory]] it makes good sense to refer in a unified way to **prequantum field theory** for all of the data related to [[Lagrangians]] that is not yet the final [[quantum field theory]]. 

In particular, an **extended prequantum field theory** of [[dimension]] $n$ is a rule that assigns

* to every (suitably [[orientation|oriented]]) [[closed manifold]] of [[dimension]] $k$ a [[prequantum n-bundle|prequantum (n-k)-bundle]]

* to every (suitably [[orientation|oriented]]) [[compact topological space|compact]] [[manifold with boundary]] $\Sigma_k$ a [[section]] of the prequantum $(n-k+1)$-bundle assigned to the [[boundary]] $\partial \Sigma_k$ and pulled back to the space of fields over $\Sigma_k$

such that this data is related suitably under [[transgression]].

The actual [[extended quantum field theory]] would be obtained from such a data by passing from the assignment of a given prequantum $(n-k)$-bundle to that of the [[n-vector space|(n-k)-vector space]] of [[polarization|polarized]] [[sections]] of a suitable [[associated infinity-bundle|associated]] [[fiber infinity-bundle|fiber bundle]].

This is summarized in the following table:

[[!include extended prequantum field theory - table]]

## Details

> under construction

We discuss local ("[[extended TQFT|extended]]") [[topological field theory|topological]] prequantum field theory. 

The following originates in the lecture notes ([Schreiber Pittsburgh13](#SchreiberPittLectures)) and draws on material that is discussed more fully in ([Fiorenza-Valentino](#FiorenzaValentino)) and ([Fiorenza-Schreiber](#FiorenzaSchreiber)).

After a technical prelimiray to set the stage in 

* _[The ambient topos](#TheTopos)_,

the first section gives the the definitions and general properties of 

* _[Local prequantum field theory](#LocalPrequantumFieldTheory)_.

To digest this the reader may first or in parallel want to look at the simplest examples of these general considerations, which we discuss below in the first subsections of

* _[Higher Dijkgraaf-Witten prequantum field theory](#HigherDijkgraafWittenLocalPrequantumFieldTheory)_.

After that we turn to the general case of examples of 

* _[Higher Chern-Simons prequantum field theory](#HigherChern-SimonsLocalPrequantumFieldTheory)_.

### The ambient topos
 {#TheTopos}

Prequantum field theory deals with "spaces of [[field (physics)|physical fields]]". These spaces of fields are, in general, richer than just plain [[sets]] in two ways

1. Spaces of fields carry [[geometry|geometric]] structure, notably they may be [[smooth spaces]], meaning that there is a way to determine which collections of fields form a smoothly parameterized collection. This is for instance the structure invoked (often implicitly) when performing [[variational calculus]] on spaces of fields in order to find their classical [[equations of motion]]. 

1. Spaces of fields have [[gauge transformations]] between their points and possibly [[higher gauge transformations]] between these, meaning that they are in fact [[groupoids]] and possibly [[infinity-groupoid|higher groupoids]]. In the physics literature this is best known in the [[infinitesimal object|infinitesimal]] approximation to these gauge transformations, in which case the spaces of fields are described by [[BRST complexes]]: the dg-algebras of functions on a [[Lie algebroid]] or [[L-∞ algebroid]] of fields.

Taken together this means that spaces of fields are _[[(∞,1)-sheaf|geometric higher groupoids]]_, such as [[orbifolds]] and more generally [[Lie groupoids]], [[differentiable stacks]], [[Lie 2-groupoids]], ... [[smooth ∞-groupoids]].

A collection of all such geometric higher groupoids for a chosen flavor of [[geometry]] -- for instance [[topology]] or [[differential geometry]] or  [[supergeometry]] (for the description of [[fermion]] fields) or [[synthetic differential geometry]] or [[synthetic differential supergeometry]], etc. -- is called an _[[∞-topos]]_. 

Not quite every [[∞-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$ serves as a decent context for collectiojns (moduli stacks) of [[physical fields]] though. In the following we need at least that $\mathbf{H}$ has a reasonable notion of _[[discrete objects]]_ so that we can identify the geometrically discrete spaces in there. We here need this to mean the following

+-- {: .num_defn #ShapeAndFlatModality}
###### Definition

An [[∞-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$ is called _[[locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos|locally ∞-connected]]_ and _[[globally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos|globally ∞-connetced]]_ if the [[locally constant ∞-stack]]-functor $LConst \colon $ [[∞Grpd]] $\to \mathbf{H}$ is a [[reflective sub-(∞,1)-category|reflective embedding]]. 

The corresponding reflector we write

$$
  \Pi \colon \mathbf{H} \to \infty Grpd \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H}
$$

and also call the _[[shape modality]]_ of $\mathbf{H}$. By the discussion at [[adjoint triple]] it follows that $LConst$ is also a [[coreflective subcategory|coreflective]] embedding; the corresponding coreflector we write 

$$
  \flat \colon \mathbf{H} \stackrel{\Gamma}{\to} \infty Grpd \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H}
$$

and call the _[[flat modality]]_.

=--

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

Every [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] is in particular globally and locally $\infty$-connected, by definition. Standard anonical exmaples to keep in mind are

* $\mathbf{H} = $ [[∞Grpd]] for [[∞-Dijkgraaf-Witten theories]];

* $\mathbf{H} = $ [[Smooth∞Grpd]] for [[schreiber:∞-Chern-Simons theories]];

* $\mathbf{H} = $ [[SuperSmooth∞Grpd]] for [[schreiber:∞-Chern-Simons theories]] with [[fermions]] and [[supersymmetry]];

* $\mathbf{H} = $ [[SynthDiff∞Grpd]] for [[AKSZ sigma-models]].

=--


### Local prequantum field theory
 {#LocalPrequantumFieldTheory}

We consider first 

* _[Bulk field theory](#BulkFieldTheory)_

which concerns the case where the [[worldvolume]]/[[spacetime]] on which the [[field (physics)|physical fields]] propagate has no [[boundaries]] with boundaries conditions imposed (no "[[branes]]" or "[[QFT with defects|defects]]"). So the main point of this section is to see how the "space of fields" -- or rather: the [[moduli stack]] of fields -- on a point induces the corresponding spaces/moduli stacks of fields on an arbitrary [[closed manifold]], and, correspondingly, how the [[prequantum n-bundle]] on the space over fields over the point induces the [[action functional]] in [[codimension]] 0.

However, what makes local prequantum field theory rich is that it naturally incorporates extra structure on [[boundaries]] of [[worldvolume]]/[[spacetime]]. In fact, under suitable conditions there is another local prequantum field theory just over the boundary, which is related to the corresponding bulk field theory possibly by a kind of [[holographic principle]]. This general mechanism we discuss in 

* _[Boundary field theory](#BoundaryFieldTheory)_.

But plain boundaries are just the first example of a general phenomenon known as "[[QFT with defects|defects]]" or "phase dualities" or "singularities" in field theories. Notably the boundary field theory itself may have boundaries, in which case this means that the original theory had _[[manifold with corners|corners]]_ where different boundary pieces meet. This we discuss in 

* _[Corner field theory](#CornerFieldTheory)


#### Bulk field theory

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, write

$$
  Bord_n^\otimes \in E_\infty Alg(Cat_{(\infty,n)})
$$

for the [[symmetric monoidal (∞,n)-category]] [[(∞,n)-category of cobordisms|of cobordisms]] with $n$-dimensional framing. For $S \to O(n)$ a homomorphism of [[∞-groups]] (may be modeled by a homomorphism of [[topological groups]]) to the [[general linear group]] (or homotopy-equivalently its [[maximal compact subgroup]], the [[orthogonal group]]), we write 

$$
  (Bord_n^S)^\otimes \in E_\infty Alg(Cat_{(\infty,n)})
$$

for the corresponding symmetric monoidal $(\infty,n)$-category of cobordimss equipped with [[G-structure|S-structure]] on their $n$-stabilized [[tangent bundle]]. 

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

In this notation we have an identification

$$
  Bord_n \simeq Bord_n^{S \coloneqq \ast}
$$

because a [[framing]] of the $n$-stabilized tangent bundle is a trivialization of that bundle and hence equivalently a [[G-structure]] for $G$ the trivial group. In ([LurieTFT](#LurieTFT)) this is denoted by "$Bord_n^{fr}$".

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

The [[cobordism theorem]] asserts, essentially, that $Bord_n$ is the [[symmetric monoidal (∞,n)-category]] with [[fully dualizable objects|full duals]] which is [[free construction|free]] on a single generator, the point. In itself this is a deep statement about the [[homotopy type]] of [[categories of cobordisms]]. But for the following discussion the reader may just take this as the _definition_ of $Bord_n$. This then makes this a very simple object, as long as we are just mapping out of it, which we do.

What this means then is that a [[monoidal (∞,n)-functor]] 

$$
  Z \colon Bord_n^\otimes \to \mathcal{C}^\otimes
$$

sends the point to some [[fully dualizable object]] $Z(\ast) \in \mathcal{C}$ and sends

* the [[circle]] $S^1$ to the [[trace]] of the identity on $Z(\ast)$, 

* the [[sphere]] $S^2$ to the 2-dimensional [[higher trace]] of the identity,

and so on.

for the resulting [[symmetric monoidal (∞,n)-category]].

In the case that $\mathbf{H} = $ [[∞Grpd]] this is a special case of ([LurieTFT, around prop. 3.2.8](#LurieTFT)), with the [[∞-group]] $B$ regarded as a special case of a [[symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category]].

Since a monoidal $(\infty,n)$-functor $\mathbf{Fields} \colon Bord_n \to Span_n(\mathbf{H})$ is determined by its value on the point, we will often notationally identify it with this value and write

#### 1d Dijkgraaf-Witten theory
 {#1dDWTheory}

[[Dijkgraaf-Witten theory]] in [[dimension]] 1 is what results when one regards a [[group character]] of a [[finite group]] $G$ as an 
[[action functional]] in 
the sense of def. \ref{LocalPrequantumFieldTheory}.
We give an expository discussion of this example and in the course of it
introduce some basics of the [[homotopy theory]] of [[groupoids]] ([[homotopy 1-types]]).

$\;$

A [[group character]] on a [[finite group]] $G$ is just a [[group]] [[homomorphism]] $G \to U(1)$ to the [[circle group]] (regarded here as a [[discrete group]]).
In order to regard this as an [[action functional]], 
we are to take $G$ as the 
[[gauge group]] of a physical field theory. The simplest
such case is a field theory such that on the point there is 
just a single possible field configuration, to be denoted $\phi_0$.
The reader familiar with basics of traditional [[gauge theory]] may think of the fields as being 
[[gauge field]] [[connections]] ("[[vector potentials]]"), hence represented by  [[differential 1-forms]]. But on the point there is only the vanishing 1-form, hence just a single field configuration $\phi_0$.

Even though there is just a single such field, that $G$ is the [[gauge group]] means that for each [[element]] $g \in G$ there is a 
[[gauge transformation]] that takes
$\phi_0$ to itself, a state of affairs which we suggestively denote by the symbols
$$
  \phi_0 \stackrel{g}{\to}  \phi_0
  \,.
$$

Again, the reader familiar with 
traditional [[gauge theory]] may think of [[gauge transformations]] as in [[Yang-Mills theory]]. Over the point these form, indeed, just the [[gauge group]] itself, taking the trivial field configuration to itself.

That the [[gauge group]] is indeed a [[group]] means that gauge transformations can be  applied consecutively, which we express in symbols as

$$
  \array{
    && \phi_0
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{g_1}}\nearrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{g_2}}
    \\
    \phi_0 && \underset{g_2 \cdot g_1}{\to} && \phi_0
  }
  \,.
$$
Regarded this way, we say the [gauge group acting on the single field $\phi_0$ forms a _[[groupoid]]_, whose single _[[object]]_ is $\phi_0$ and whose set of _[[morphisms]]_ is $G$.

 while for nontrivial geometry there are genuine groupoid theories, 
 for instance the [[AKSZ sigma-models]]. But even so, 
 [[Dijkgraaf-Witten theory]] is usefully discussed in terms of groupoid technology, in particular since the choice of equivalence in

###### Proposition

The prequantum field theory defined by a [[group character]]
  $$
    \left[
      \array{
	    \mathbf{Field}
		\\
                \downarrow^{\mathrlap{S}}
		\\
		\flat \mathbf{B}U(1)
	  }
	\right]

    \left[
      \array{
	    \mathbf{B}G

                \downarrow^{\mathrlap{c}}
		\\
		\flat \mathbf{B}U(1)
	  }
	\right]	
  $$
  assigns to the [[circle]] the [[action functional]] which 
  sends a [[field configuration]] $g \in G = [\Pi(S^1), \mathbf{B}G]_0$
  to its value $c(g) \in U(1) = (\flat \mathbf{B}U(1))_1$.
