## Idea

The notion of _[[quantum field theory]]_ exists without reference to any predefined notion of _[[configuration space]]_ of _[[quantum fields]]_, _[[action functional]]_, _[[phase space]]_ etc.: 

A [[quantum field theory]] in [[FQFT]]-[[axiomatization]] is simply a consistent assignment of [[spaces of quantum states]], whereas in [[AQFT]]-[[axiomatization]] it is a consistent assignment of [[algebras of quantum observables]], and that's it. 

However, most (or maybe all?) quantum field theories of interest in actual [[physics]] (as opposed to as devices of pure [[mathematics]]) are not random models of these axioms, but do arise under a process called [[quantization]] from a ([[local Lagrangian|local]]/[[extended Lagrangian|extended]]) [[Lagrangian]], hence from an [[action functional]], defined on a [[configuration space]] of [[quantum fields]], or else arise as [[holographic duals]] of quantum field theories that arise by quantization. Moreover, the extra information provided by the Lagrangian is commonly used (and is maybe strictly necessary) to interpret the mathematical structure of the axiomatic QFT in actual [[physics]] (though notably in [[AQFT]] there are results that re-extract at least parts of this data from the axiomatic QFT, for instance the [[Doplicher-Roberts reconstruction theorem]] which extract the [[global gauge group]] from the [[local net of quantum observables]]).

There are in turn two formalizations of the notion of [[quantization]]: _algebraic [[deformation quantization]]_ and _[[geometric quantization]]_. In the latter one speaks of _[[prequantization]]_ when referring to a precursor step to the actual quantization step, in which the [[symplectic form]] on [[phase space]] is lifted to [[differential cohomology]], hence to a [[prequantum bundle]]. But in the context of [[higher geometry]] and [[higher geometric quantization]] this prequantization step is already part of the data of the [[Lagrangian]] itself: an [[extended Lagrangian]] already encodes not just the [[action functional]] but also the [[prequantum bundle]] and all the [[prequantum n-bundle|prequantum (n-k)-bundles]] in each [[dimension]] $k$. The action functional itself is the _[[prequantum 0-bundle]]_  in this context.

Therefore, in the refined picture of [[higher geometry]]/[[extended quantum field theory]] it makes good sense to refer in a unified way to **prequantum field theory** for all of the data related to [[Lagrangians]] that is not yet the final [[quantum field theory]]. 

In particular, an **extended prequantum field theory** of [[dimension]] $n$ is a rule that assigns

* to every (suitably [[orientation|oriented]]) [[closed manifold]] of [[dimension]] $k$ a [[prequantum n-bundle|prequantum (n-k)-bundle]]

* to every (suitably [[orientation|oriented]]) [[compact topological space|compact]] [[manifold with boundary]] $\Sigma_k$ a [[section]] of the prequantum $(n-k+1)$-bundle assigned to the [[boundary]] $\partial \Sigma_k$ and pulled back to the space of fields over $\Sigma_k$

such that this data is related suitably under [[transgression]].

The actual [[extended quantum field theory]] would be obtained from such a data by passing from the assignment of a given prequantum $(n-k)$-bundle to that of the [[n-vector space|(n-k)-vector space]] of [[polarization|polarized]] [[sections]] of a suitable [[associated infinity-bundle|associated]] [[fiber infinity-bundle|fiber bundle]].

This is summarized in the following table:

[[!include extended prequantum field theory - table]]

## Details

> under construction

We discuss local ("[[extended TQFT|extended]]") [[topological field theory|topological]] prequantum field theory. 

The following originates in the lecture notes ([Schreiber Pittsburgh13](#SchreiberPittLectures)) and draws on material that is discussed more fully in ([Fiorenza-Valentino](#FiorenzaValentino)) and ([hCSlpQFT](#hCSlpQFT)).

After a technical preliminary to set the stage in 

* _[The ambient topos](#TheTopos)_,

the first section gives the the definitions and general properties of 

* _[Local prequantum field theory](#LocalPrequantumFieldTheory)_.

To digest this the reader may first or in parallel want to look at the simplest examples of these general considerations, which we discuss below in the first subsections of

* _[Higher Dijkgraaf-Witten prequantum field theory](#HigherDijkgraafWittenLocalPrequantumFieldTheory)_.

After that we turn to the general case of examples of 

* _[Higher Chern-Simons prequantum field theory](#HigherChern-SimonsLocalPrequantumFieldTheory)_.

Here the pattern of the discussion of examples is the following:

| | [[local prequantum field theory]] | [[homotopy theory]] |  | [[local action functional]] / [[prequantum n-bundle]] |  |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| **1)** | [[1-dimensional Dijkgraaf-Witten theory]] | [[1-groupoids]]/[[homotopy 1-types]] | $\mathbf{B}\flat G$ | $-$[[group character]]$\to$ | $\mathbf{B}\flat U(1)$ |
| | $\vdots$ |  |  |  |  |
| **2)** | [[n-dimensional Dijkgraaf-Witten theory]] | [[n-groupoids]]/[[homotopy n-types]] | $\mathbf{B}\flat G$ | $-$[[cocycle]] in [[group cohomology]]$\to$ | $\mathbf{B}^n\flat U(1)$ |
|  |  |  |  $\downarrow$ | embed [[flat ∞-connections]] in all [[principal ∞-connections]] |  $\downarrow$ |
| **3)** | [[schreiber:infinity-Chern-Simons theory|n-dimensional Chern-Simons theory]] | [[n-stacks]]/[[smooth homotopy n-types]] | $\mathbf{B}G_{conn}$ | $-$[[cocycle]] in [[differential cohomology]]$\to$ | $\mathbf{B}^n U(1)_{conn}$ |

### The ambient topos
 {#TheTopos}

Prequantum field theory deals with "spaces of [[field (physics)|physical fields]]". These spaces of [[field (physics)|fields]] are, in general, richer than just plain [[sets]] in two ways

1. Spaces of [[field (physics)|fields]] carry [[geometry|geometric]] structure, notably they may be [[smooth spaces]], meaning that there is a way to determine which collections of [[field (physics)|fields]] form a smoothly parameterized collection. This is for instance the structure invoked (often implicitly) when performing [[variational calculus]] on spaces of [[field (physics)|fields]] in order to find their classical [[equations of motion]]. 

1. Spaces of fields have [[gauge transformations]] between their points and possibly [[higher gauge transformations]] between these, meaning that they are in fact [[groupoids]] and possibly [[infinity-groupoid|higher groupoids]]. In the physics literature this is best known in the [[infinitesimal object|infinitesimal]] approximation to these gauge transformations, in which case the spaces of fields are described by [[BRST complexes]]: the dg-algebras of functions on a [[Lie algebroid]] or [[L-∞ algebroid]] of fields.

Taken together this means that spaces of fields are _[[(∞,1)-sheaf|geometric higher groupoids]]_, such as [[orbifolds]] and more generally [[Lie groupoids]], [[differentiable stacks]], [[Lie 2-groupoids]], ... [[smooth ∞-groupoids]].

A collection of all such geometric higher groupoids for a chosen flavor of [[geometry]] -- for instance [[topology]] or [[differential geometry]] or  [[supergeometry]] (for the description of [[fermion]] fields) or [[synthetic differential geometry]] or [[synthetic differential supergeometry]], etc. -- is called an _[[∞-topos]]_. 

Not quite every [[∞-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$ serves as a decent context for collections (moduli stacks) of [[physical fields]] though. In the following we need at least that $\mathbf{H}$ has a reasonable notion of _[[discrete objects]]_ so that we can identify the geometrically discrete spaces in there. We here need this to mean the following

+-- {: .num_defn #ShapeAndFlatModality}
###### Definition

An [[∞-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$ is called _[[locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos|locally ∞-connected]]_ and _[[globally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos|globally ∞-connetced]]_ if the [[locally constant ∞-stack]]-functor $LConst \colon $ [[∞Grpd]] $\to \mathbf{H}$ is a [[reflective sub-(∞,1)-category|reflective embedding]]. 

The corresponding reflector we write

$$
  \Pi \colon \mathbf{H} \to \infty Grpd \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H}
$$

and also call the _[[shape modality]]_ of $\mathbf{H}$. By the discussion at [[adjoint triple]] it follows that $LConst$ is also a [[coreflective subcategory|coreflective]] embedding; the corresponding coreflector we write 

$$
  \flat \colon \mathbf{H} \stackrel{\Gamma}{\to} \infty Grpd \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H}
$$

and call the _[[flat modality]]_.

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

Every [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] is in particular globally and locally $\infty$-connected, by definition. Standard canonical examples to keep in mind are

* $\mathbf{H} = $ [[∞Grpd]] for [[∞-Dijkgraaf-Witten theories]];

* $\mathbf{H} = $ [[Smooth∞Grpd]] for [[schreiber:∞-Chern-Simons theories]];

* $\mathbf{H} = $ [[SuperSmooth∞Grpd]] for [[schreiber:∞-Chern-Simons theories]] with [[fermions]] and [[supersymmetry]];

* $\mathbf{H} = $ [[SynthDiff∞Grpd]] for [[AKSZ sigma-models]].

### Local prequantum field theory
 {#LocalPrequantumFieldTheory}

After sketching out the general 

* _[Idea](#PrequantumFieldTheoryIdea)_

we formulate first 

* _[Bulk field theory](#BulkFieldTheory)_,

which concerns the case where the [[worldvolume]]/[[spacetime]] on which the [[field (physics)|physical fields]] propagate has no [[boundaries]] with [[boundary conditions]] imposed (no "[[branes]]" or "[[domain walls]]" or "[[QFT with defects|defects]]"). The point of this section is to see how the "space of fields" -- or rather: the [[moduli stack]] of fields -- on a point induces the corresponding spaces/moduli stacks of fields on an arbitrary [[closed manifold]], and, correspondingly, how the [[prequantum n-bundle]] on the space over fields over the point induces the [[action functional]] in [[codimension]] 0.

However, what makes local prequantum field theory rich is that it naturally incorporates extra structure on [[boundaries]] of [[worldvolume]]/[[spacetime]]. In fact, under suitable conditions there is another local prequantum field theory just over the boundary, which is related to the corresponding bulk field theory possibly by a kind of [[holographic principle]]. This general mechanism we discuss in 

* _[Boundary field theory](#BoundaryFieldTheory)_.

But plain boundaries are just the first example of a general phenomenon known as "[[QFT with defects|defects]]" or "phase dualities" or "singularities" in field theories. Notably the boundary field theory itself may have boundaries, in which case this means that the original theory had _[[manifold with corners|corners]]_ where different boundary pieces meet. This we discuss in 

* _[Corner field theory](#CornerFieldTheory)_.

Generally there are fields theories with general such singularties:

[[!include field theory with boundaries and defects - table]]


#### Idea
 {#PrequantumFieldTheoryIdea}

A _prequantum field theory_ is, at its heart, an assignment that sends a piece of [[worldvolume]]/[[spacetime]] $\Sigma$ -- technically a [[cobordism]] with [[boundary]] and [[corners]] -- to the 

1. [[space]] of [[physical field|field configurations]] over incoming and outgoing pieces of worldvolume/spacetime;

1. the space of field configurations over the bulk worldvolume/spacetime -- the [[trajectories]] of fields;

1. an [[action functional]] that assigns to all these field configurations [[phases]] in a compatible manner. 

These field configurations and spaces of [[trajectories]] between them are represented by [[spans]]/[[correspondences]] of ([[moduli space|moduli]]-)spaces of fields ([[moduli stacks]], really), hence [[diagrams]] of the form

$$
  \mathbf{Fields}_{in}
  \leftarrow
  \mathbf{Fields}
  \rightarrow
  \mathbf{Fields}_{out}
  \,.
$$

Here $\mathbf{Fields}_{in}$ is to be thought of as the space of incoming fields, $\mathbf{Fields}_{out}$ that of outgoing fields, and $\mathbf{Fields}$ the space of all fields on some [[cobordism]] connecting the incoming and the outgoing pieces of [[worldvolume]]/[[spacetime]]. The left map sends such a trajectory to its starting configuration, and the right one sends it to its end configuration.

Given two such spans/correspondences, that share a common field configuration as in 

$$
  \array{
    && \mathbf{Fields}_1 && && \mathbf{Fields}_2
    \\
    & \swarrow && \searrow && \swarrow && \searrow
    \\
    \mathbf{Fields}_{in_1}
    && &&
    \mathbf{Fields}_{out_1} = \mathbf{Fields}_{in_2}
    && &&
    \mathbf{Fields}_{out_2}
  }
$$ 

can be [[composition|composed]], by forming consecutive trajectories from all pairs of trajectories that match in the middle. The space of these composed trajectories is the [[fiber product]] 
$\mathbf{Fields}_1 \underset{{\mathbf{Fields}_{out_1}} \atop {=\mathbf{Fields}_{in_2}}}{\times} \mathbf{Fields}_2$ which sits in a new [[span]]/[[correspondence]]

$$
  \mathbf{Fields}_{in_1}
  \leftarrow
  \mathbf{Fields}_1 \underset{{\mathbf{Fields}_{out_1}} \atop {=\mathbf{Fields}_{in_2}}}{\times} \mathbf{Fields}_2
  \rightarrow
  \mathbf{Fields}_{out_2}
$$

exhibiting the composite of the previous two. This way, spaces of fields with spans/correspondences between them form a [[category]], which we denote $Span_1(\mathbf{H})$ if $\mathbf{H}$ denotes the ambient context (a [[topos]]) in which the spaces of fields live. 

If two cobordisms run in parallel, then the field configurations on their union are pairs of the original field configurations, which are elements in the [[cartesian product]] of spaces of fields. Hence the operations

$$
  \left(
  \mathbf{Fields}_{in}
  \leftarrow
  \mathbf{Fields}
  \rightarrow
  \mathbf{Fields}_{out}
  \right)
  \otimes
  \left(
  \tilde \mathbf{Fields}_{in}
  \leftarrow
  \tilde \mathbf{Fields}
  \rightarrow
  \tilde\mathbf{Fields}_{out}
  \right)  
  \;\;\coloneqq\;\;
  \left(
    \mathbf{Fields}_{in} \times \tilde\mathbf{Fields}_{in}
    \leftarrow
    \mathbf{Fields} \times \tilde\mathbf{Fields}
    \to
    \mathbf{Fields}_{out} \times \tilde\mathbf{Fields}_{out}    
  \right)
$$

make this category of fields and correspondence into a [[monoidal category]]. 

Then a choice of field configurations for a (not yet localized) field theory in dimension $n \in \mathbb{N}$ is a [[monoidal functor]] from a [[category of cobordisms]] of dimension $n$ to such a category of [[spans]]/[[correspondences]]

$$
  \mathbf{Fields} \colon Bord_n^\otimes \to Span_1(\mathbf{H})^\otimes
  \,,
$$

namely a consistent assignment that to each [[closed manifold]] $\Sigma_{n-1}$ of dimension $(n-1)$ assigns a space of field configurations $\mathbf{Fields}(\Sigma_{n-1})$ and that to each [[cobordism]]

$$
  \Sigma_{in} \to \Sigma \leftarrow \Sigma_{out}
$$

assigns a [[span]]/[[correspondence]] of spaces of field configurations and trajectories

$$
  \mathbf{Fields}(\Sigma_{in})
  \leftarrow
  \mathbf{Fields}(\Sigma)
  \rightarrow
  \mathbf{Fields}_{\Sigma_{out}}
  \,.
$$

Apart from the field configurations themselves, prequantum field theory assigns to each [[trajectory]] a "[[phase]]" -- an element in the [[circle group]] $U(1)$ -- by a map called the (exponentiated) [[action functional]]. In order to nicely relate that to the expression of spaces of trajectories as [[spans]]/[[correspondences]] as above, it is useful to think of the [[circle group]] here as being the [[automorphisms]] of something. This is universally accomplished by taking it to be the automorphisms of the unique point in the [[delooping]] [[groupoid]] $\mathbf{B}U(1) = \{\ast \stackrel{c \in U(1)}{\to} \ast\}$. (A lightning review of [[groupoid]]-[[homotopy theory]] is below in [Groupoids and basic homotopy 1-type theory](#GroupoidsAndBasicHomotopy1TypeTheory).) In other words, we think of the group of phases $U(1)$ as the space of [[homotopies]] from the point to itself in the [[Eilenberg-MacLane space]] $\mathbf{B}U(1)$, expressed by the [[diagram]] (a [[homotopy fiber product]] diagram)

$$
  \array{
    && U(1)
    \\
    & \swarrow && \searrow
    \\
    \ast && \swArrow && \ast 
    \\
    & \searrow && \swarrow
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}U(1)
  }
  \,.
$$

Using this, if we assume for simplicity that the in- and outgoing field configurations are sent constantly to the point in $\mathbf{B}U(1)$, then an (exponentiated) [[action functional]] on the space of trajectories $\exp(i S) \colon \mathbf{Fields} \to U(1)$ is equivalently a [[homotopy]] as shown on the left of the following diagram

$$
  \array{
    && \mathbf{Fields}
    \\
    & \swarrow && \searrow
    \\
    \mathbf{Fields}_{in}
    && \swArrow &&
    \mathbf{Fields}_{out}
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{0}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{0}}
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}U(1)
  }
  \;\;\;\;
  \simeq
  \;\;\;\;
  \array{
    && \mathbf{Fields}
    \\
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\exp(i S)}}
    \\
    && U(1)
    \\
    & \swarrow && \searrow
    \\
    \ast && \swArrow && \ast
    \\
    & \searrow && \swarrow
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}U(1)
  }
  \,.
$$

Hence action functionals are naturally incorporated into [[spans]]/[[correspondences]] of [[moduli spaces]] of fields simply by regarding these to be formed not in the ambient [[topos]] $\mathbf{H}$ itself, but in its [[slice topos]] $\mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}U(1)}$, where each object is equipped with a map to $\mathbf{B}U(1)$ and each morphism with a [[homotopy]] in $\mathbf{B}U(1)$ between the corresponding maps.

We write $\mathrm{Span}_1(\mathbf{H}, \mathbf{B}U(1))$ for the category of spans/correspondences as before, but now equipped with maps to, and transformations over, $\mathbf{B}U(1)$ as in the above diagram. 

Then an [[action functional]] for a choice of field configurations that itself is given as a [[monoidal functor]] $\mathbf{Fields} \colon Bord_n^\otimes \to Span_1(\mathbf{H})$ as above is a monoidal functor

$$
  S \colon Bord_n^\otimes \to Span_1(\mathbf{H}, \mathbf{B}U(1))
$$

such that the spans of spaces of fields are those specified before, hence such that it fits as a lift into the diagram

$$
  \array{
     && Span_1(\mathbf{H}, \mathbf{B}U(1))
     \\
     & {}^{\mathllap{S}}\nearrow & \downarrow 
     \\
     Bord_n &\underset{\mathbf{Fields}}{\to}& Span_1(\mathbf{H})
  }
  \,,
$$

where the right vertical functor [[forgetful functor|forgets]] the phase assignments and just remembers the correspondences of field trajectories.


So far this is a non-local (or: not-necessarily local) prequantum field theory, since it assigns data only to entire $n$-dimensional cobordisms and $(n-1)$-dimensional [[closed manifolds]], but is not guaranteed to be obtained by integrating up local data over little pieces of these manifolds. The latter possibility is however the characteristic property of [[local quantum field theory]], which in turn is the flavor of quantum field theory that seems to matter in nature, and fundamentally.

In order to formalize this localization, we allow the cobordisms to contain higher-[[codimension]] pieces that are [[manifolds with corners]]. These then form not just a [[category of cobordisms]], but an [[(∞,n)-category]] of cobordisms, which we will still denote $Bord_n^\otimes$. If we now have a cobordism with [[codimension]]-2 [[corners]], then the field configurations over it now form a span-of-spans

$$
  \array{
    \mathbf{Fields}_{ii} &\leftarrow& \mathbf{Fields}_{ic} &\to& \mathbf{Fields}_{io}
    \\
    \uparrow && \uparrow && \uparrow
    \\
    \mathbf{Fields}_{ci} &\leftarrow& \mathbf{Fields}_{cc} &\to& \mathbf{Fields}_{co}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbf{Fields}_{oi} &\leftarrow& \mathbf{Fields}_{oc} &\to& \mathbf{Fields}_{oo}
  }
  \,.
$$

Generally, for $n$-dimensional cobordism that are "localized" all the way to [[corners]] in codimension $n$, their field configurations and trajectories-of-trajectories etc. form $n$-dimensional cubes of spans-of-spans this way. We write $Span_n(\mathbf{H})$ for the resulting [[(∞,n)-category of spans]].

In order to still have an [[action functional]] on trajectories is [[codimension]]-0 associated with this in the above fashion, we need to [[delooping|deloop]] $U(1)$ $n$-times to the [[n-groupoid]] $\mathbf{B}^n U(1)$ (the [[circle n-group|circle (n+1)-group]]). Accordingly a local prequantum field theory in dimension $n$ is given by a [[monoidal (∞,n)-functor]]

$$
  S \colon Bord_n^\otimes \to Span_n(\mathbf{H}, \mathbf{B}^n U(1))
  \,.
$$

The point of local topological (prequantum) field theory is that by the [[cobordism theorem]] the above story reverses: the assignment of fields and their action functional in higher dimension is necessarily given by [[higher traces]] of the data assigned in lower dimension. Hence the whole assignment $S$ above is fixed by its value on the point, hence by a choice of one single map

$$
  \left[
    \array{
      \mathbf{Fields}(\ast)
      \\
      \downarrow^\mathrlap{S}
      \\
      \mathbf{B}U(1)
    }
  \right]
  \,,
$$

the fully localized action functional. Or rather, this is the case for pure bulk field theory, with no [[branes]] or [[domain walls]]. If these are present, then each type of them in dimension $k$ is specified by a [[k-morphism]] in $Span_n(\mathbf{H}, \mathbf{B}^n U(1))$.

All this we now describe more formally.

#### Bulk field theory
 {#BulkFieldTheory}

We now first consider the formalization of prequantum field theory
in the absence of any data such as [[boundary conditions]], [[domain walls]], [[branes]], [[QFT with defects|defects]], etc. This describes either field theories in which no such phenomena are taken to be present, or else it describes that part of those field theories where such phenomena are present in principle, but restricted to the "[[bulk]]" of [[worldvolume]]/[[spacetime]] where they are not. Therefore it makes sense to speak of _bulk field theory_ in this case.

###### Remark

In this notation we have an identification

because a [[framing]] of the $n$-stabilized tangent bundle is a trivialization of that bundle and hence equivalently a [[G-structure]] for $G$ the trivial group. In ([LurieTFT](#LurieTFT)) this is denoted by "$Bord_n^{fr}$".

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

The [[cobordism theorem]] asserts, essentially, that $Bord_n$ is the [[symmetric monoidal (∞,n)-category]] with [[fully dualizable objects|full duals]] which is [[free construction|free]] on a single generator, the point. In itself this is a deep statement about the [[homotopy type]] of [[categories of cobordisms]]. But for the following discussion the reader may just take this as the _definition_ of $Bord_n$. This then makes $Bord_n$ a very simple object, as long as we are just mapping out of it, which we do.

What this means then is that a [[monoidal (∞,n)-functor]] 

$$
  Z \colon Bord_n^\otimes \to \mathcal{C}^\otimes
$$

sends the point to some [[fully dualizable object]] $Z(\ast) \in \mathcal{C}$ and sends

* the [[circle]] $S^1$ to the [[trace]] of the identity on $Z(\ast)$, 

* the [[sphere]] $S^2$ to the 2-dimensional [[higher trace]] of the identity,

and so on.

###### Remark

Since the [[slice (∞,1)-category]] $\mathbf{H}_{/\flat \mathbf{B}^n U(1)}$ is itself an [[(∞,1)-topos]] -- the [[slice (∞,1)-topos]] -- we also have $Span_n(\mathbf{H}_{/\flat \mathbf{B}^n U(1)})$, according to def. \ref{CorrespondencesInInfinityTopos}. As an [[(∞,n)-category]] this is equivalent to $Span_n(\mathbf{H}, \flat \mathbf{B}^n U(1))$ from def. \ref{CorrespondencesOverB}, but the [[monoidal (∞,n)-category|monoidal structure]] is different. The [[cartesian product]] in the slice is given by [[homotopy fiber product]] in $\mathbf{H}$ over $\flat \mathbf{B}^n U(1)$, not by the addition in the [[∞-group]] structure on $\flat \mathbf{B}^n U(1)$, as in def. \ref{CorrespondencesOverB}.

By the defining property of the [[mapping stack]] construction, this means that if $\mathcal{C}$ is an [[(∞,1)-site]] of definition of the [[(∞,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$, then $[\Pi(\Sigma_k), \mathbf{Fields}]$ is the [[∞-stack]] which to $U \in \mathcal{C}$ assigns the [[(∞,1)-categorical hom space]]

### Classical mechanics as prequantum field theory

Traditional [[classical mechanics]] ([[Hamiltonian mechanics]], [[Lagrangian mechanics]], [[Hamilton-Jacobi theory]]) is naturally understood as a special case of -- and in fact as deriving from -- local prequantum field theory over $\mathbf{B}U(1)_{conn}$. This is discussed in some detail at

* _[[prequantized Lagrangian correspondence]]_.

### Higher Dijkgraaf-Witten local prequantum field theory
 {#HigherDijkgraafWittenLocalPrequantumFieldTheory}

We discuss here aspects of higher [[Dijkgraaf-Witten theory]]-type 
prequantum field theories, which are those prequantum field theories 
whose moduli stack $\mathbf{Fields}$ is a [[discrete ∞-groupoid]] 
(and usually also required to be finite, especially if its [[quantization]] is considered).
This is a special case of the higher Chern-Simons theories discussed below in _[Higher Chern-Simons local prequantum field theory](#HigherChern-SimonsLocalPrequantumFieldTheory)_, and hence strictly speaking need not be discussed separately. We use it here as a means to review some of the relevant [[homotopy theory]] by way of pertinent examples.

The original [[Dijkgraaf-Witten theory]] is that in dimension 3 (reviewed in _[3d Local prequantum field theory](#3dDWLocalPrequantumFieldTheory)_ below), which was introduced in 
([Dijkgraaf-Witten 90](Dijkgraaf-Witten+theory#DijkgraafWitten90)) as a toy version of standard 3d [[Chern-Simons theory]] for [[simply connected topological space|simply connected]] [[gauge group]]. A comprehensive account with first indications of its role as a local (extended, multi-tiered) field theory
then appeared in 
([Freed-Quinn 93](Dijkgraaf-Witten+theory#FreedQuinn93)), and ever since this has served as a testing ground for understanding the general principles of local field theory, e.g. 
([Freed 94](Dijkgraaf-Witten+theory#Freed94)), 
independently of the subtleties of giving meaning to concepts such as the path integral when the space of fields is not finite.
In section 3 of ([FHLT 10](#FHLT)), the general prequantum formalization as in  def. \ref{LocalPrequantumFieldWithAction} is sketched for Dijkgraaf-Witten type theories, 
and in section 8 there the quantization of these
theories to genuine local quantum field theories is sketched.



#### 1d Dijkgraaf-Witten theory
 {#1dDWTheory}

[[Dijkgraaf-Witten theory]] in [[dimension]] 1 is what results when one regards a [[group character]] of a [[finite group]] $G$ as a local 
[[action functional]] in 
the sense of def. \ref{LocalPrequantumFieldWithAction}.
We give now an expository discussion of this simple but instructive example of a local prequantum field theory and in the course of it
introduce some of the relevant basics of the [[homotopy theory]] of [[groupoids]] ([[homotopy 1-types]]).

1. [Finite gauge groups](#FiniteGaugeGroups)

1. [Essence of gauge theory: Groupoids and basic homotopy 1-type theory](#GroupoidsAndBasicHomotopy1TypeTheory) 

1. [Trajectories of fields: Correspondences of groupoids](#CorrespondencesOfGroupoids)

1. [Action functionals on spaces of trajectories: Correspondences of groupoids over the space of phases](#1dDWLocalFieldTheory)

The punchline of this section is little theorem \ref{GroupCharacterPrequantumTheoryOnCircle} at the very end, which states that the 1d local prequantum field theory whose local action functional is the delooping of a [[group character]] assigns to the circle the [[action functional]] which is again that group character. The proof of this statement is an unwinding of the basic mechanisms of local prequantum field theories.


##### Finite gauge groups
 {#FiniteGaugeGroups} 


First some brief remarks, before we dive into the formalism.

A [[group character]] on a [[finite group]] $G$ is just a [[group]] [[homomorphism]] $G \to U(1)$ to the [[circle group]] (taken here as a [[discrete group]]).
In order to regard this as an [[action functional]], 
we are to take $G$ as the 
[[gauge group]] of a physical field theory. The simplest
such case is a field theory such that on the point there is 
just a single possible field configuration, to be denoted $\phi_0$.
The reader familiar with basics of traditional [[gauge theory]] may think of the fields as being 
[[gauge field]] [[connections]] ("[[vector potentials]]"), hence represented by  [[differential 1-forms]]. But on the point there is only the vanishing 1-form, hence just a single field configuration $\phi_0$.

Even though there is just a single such field, that $G$ is the [[gauge group]] means that for each [[element]] $g \in G$ there is a 
[[gauge transformation]] that takes
$\phi_0$ to itself, a state of affairs which we suggestively denote by the symbols
$$
  \phi_0 \stackrel{g}{\to}  \phi_0
  \,.
$$

Again, the reader familiar with 
traditional [[gauge theory]] may think of [[gauge transformations]] as in [[Yang-Mills theory]]. Over the point these form, indeed, just the [[gauge group]] itself, taking the trivial field configuration to itself.

That the [[gauge group]] is indeed a [[group]] means that gauge transformations can be  applied consecutively, which we express in symbols as

$$
  \array{
    && \phi_0
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{g_1}}\nearrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{g_2}}
    \\
    \phi_0 && \underset{g_2 \cdot g_1}{\to} && \phi_0
  }
  \,.
$$

Regarded this way, we say the [[gauge group]] acting on the single field $\phi_0$ forms a _[[groupoid]]_, whose single _[[object]]_ is $\phi_0$ and whose set of _[[morphisms]]_ is $G$. 

Of course in richer field theories there may be more than one field configuration, clearly, with gauge transformations between them. If $\phi_0$ and $\phi_1$ are two field configurations and $g$ is a gauge transformation taking one to the other, we may usefully denote this by

$$
  \array{
    \phi_0 &\stackrel{g_1}{\to}& \phi_1
  }
   \,.
$$

Similarly then for yet another gauge configuration to another field configuration

$$
  \array{
    \phi_1 &\stackrel{g_2}{\to}& \phi_2
  }
$$


then composing them gives the picture

$$
  \array{
    && \phi_1
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{g_1}}\nearrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{g_2}}
    \\
    \phi_0 && \underset{g_2 \cdot g_1}{\to} && \phi_2
  }
  \,.
$$

We now discuss this notion of [[groupoids]] more formally.

##### Essence of gauge theory: Groupoids and basic homotopy 1-type theory
 {#GroupoidsAndBasicHomotopy1TypeTheory}


The following is a quick review of basics of [[groupoids]] and their [[homotopy theory]] ([[homotopy 1-type]]-theory), geared towards the constructions and fact needed for 1-dimensional Dijkgraaf-Witten theory. For more along these lines see also at _[[geometry of physics -- homotopy types]]_

+-- {: .num_defn #Groupoid}
###### Definition

A ([[small category|small]]) _[[groupoid]]_ $\mathcal{G}_\bullet$ is

* a pair of [[sets]] $\mathcal{G}_0 \in Set $ (the set of [[objects]]) and $\mathcal{G}_1 \in Set$ (the set of [[morphisms]])

* equipped with [[functions]]

  $$
    \array{
      \mathcal{G}_1 \times_{\mathcal{G}_0} \mathcal{G}_1
      &\stackrel{\circ}{\longrightarrow}&
      \mathcal{G}_1
      & \stackrel{\overset{t}{\longrightarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{i}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{s}{\longrightarrow}}}&
      \mathcal{G}_0
    }\,,
  $$

  where the [[fiber product]] on the left is that over $\mathcal{G}_1 \stackrel{t}{\to} \mathcal{G}_0 \stackrel{s}{\leftarrow} \mathcal{G}_1$, 

such that

* $i$ takes values in [[endomorphisms]];

  $$
    t \circ i = s \circ i =   id_{\mathcal{G}_0}, \;\;\; 
  $$

* $\circ$ defines a partial [[composition]] operation which is [[associativity|associative]] and [[unitality|unital]] for $i(\mathcal{G}_0)$ the [[identities]]; in particular

  $s (g \circ f) = s(f)$ and $t (g \circ f) = t(g)$;

* every morphism has an [[inverse]] under this composition.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

This data is visualized as follows. The set of morphisms is 

$$
  \mathcal{G}_1
  = 
  \left\{
    \phi_0 \stackrel{k}{\to} \phi_1
  \right\}
$$

and the set of pairs of composable morphisms is

$$
  \mathcal{G}_2 \coloneqq \mathcal{G}_1 \underset{\mathcal{G}_0}{\times} \mathcal{G}_1
  =
  \left\{
    \array{
      && \phi_1

      \\
      \phi_0 && \stackrel{k_2 \circ k_1}{\to} && \phi_2
    }
  \right\}
  \,.
$$

The functions $p_1, p_2, \circ \colon \mathcal{G}_2 \to \mathcal{G}_1$ are those which send, respectively, these triangular diagrams to the left morphism, or the right morphism, or the bottom morphism.

For $X$ a [[set]], it becomes a groupoid by taking $X$ to be the set of objects and adding only precisely the [[identity]] morphism from each object to itself

$$
  \left(
    X 
    \stackrel
    {\overset{id}{\longrightarrow}}
    {
      \stackrel{\overset{id}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{id}{\longrightarrow}}

###### Example

For $G$ a [[group]], its [[delooping]] [[groupoid]] $(\mathbf{B}G)_\bullet$ has

* $(\mathbf{B}G)_0 = \ast$;

* $(\mathbf{B}G)_1 = G$.

For $G$ and $K$ two groups, group homomorphisms $f \colon G \to K$
are in [[natural bijection]] with groupoid homomorphisms
$$
  (\mathbf{B}f)_\bullet
  \;\colon\;
  (\mathbf{B}G)_\bullet \to (\mathbf{B}K)_\bullet
  \,.
$$

In 
particular a [[group character]] $c \colon G \to U(1)$ is equivalently a groupoid homomorphism

$$
  (\mathbf{B}c)_\bullet 
   \;\colon\;
   (\mathbf{B}G)_\bullet 
     \to
   (\mathbf{B}U(1))_\bullet
  \,.
$$

Here, for the time being, all groups are [[discrete groups]]. Since the [[circle group]] $U(1)$ also has a standard structure of a [[Lie group]], and since later for the discussion of Chern-Simons type theories this will be relevant, we will write from now on

$$
  \flat U(1) \in Grp
$$

to mean explicitly the [[discrete group]] underlying the circle group. (Here "$\flat$" denotes the "[[flat modality]]".)

###### Example

For $X $ a [[set]], $G$ a [[discrete group]] and $\rho \colon X \times G \to X$ an [[action]] of $G$ on $X$ (a [[permutation representation]]), the **[[action groupoid]]** or **[[homotopy quotient]]** of $X$ by $G$ is the groupoid

$$
  X//_\rho G
  = 
  \left(
    X \times G
    \stackrel{\overset{\rho}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{p_1}{\longrightarrow}}
    X
  \right)
$$

with composition induced by the product in $G$. Hence this is the groupoid whose objects are the elements of $X$, and where [[morphisms]] are of the form

$$
  x_1 \stackrel{g}{\to} x_2 = \rho(x_1)(g)
$$

for $x_1, x_2 \in X$, $g \in G$.

$$
  (\ast //G)_\bullet = (\mathbf{B}G)_\bullet
  \,.
$$

Another canonical action is the action of $G$ on itself by right multiplication. The corresponding action groupoid we write

$$
  (\mathbf{E}G)_\bullet \coloneqq G//G
  \,.
$$

The constant map $G \to \ast$ induces a canonical morphism

$$

For $X$ a [[groupoid]], $G$ a [[group]] and $X \to \mathbf{B}G$ a map into its [[delooping]], the [[pullback]] $P \to X$ of the $G$-[[universal principal bundle]] of example \ref{BGGroupoidAsActionGroupoid}
is equivalently the [[homotopy fiber product]] of $X$ with the point over $\matrhbf{B}G$:

$$
  P \simeq X \underset{\mathbf{B}G}{\times} \ast

Namely both squares in the following diagram are pullback squares

  \ast \underset{X}{\times} \ast

the [[loop space object|loop space groupoid]] of $X$.

For $G$ a group and $\mathbf{B}G$ its  [[delooping]] groupoid from
  example \ref{DeloopingGroupoid}, we have
  $$
    G \simeq \Omega \mathbf{B}G = \ast \underset{\mathbf{B}G}{\times} \ast

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We are to compute the ordinary limiting cone $\ast \underset{\mathbf{B}G_\bullet}{\times}  (\mathbf{B}G^I)_\bullet \underset{\mathbf{B}G_\bullet}{\times} \ast$ in

$$
  \array{

    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(ev_1)_\bullet}}
    \\
    \ast &\underset{}{\to}& \mathbf{B}G_\bullet
  }
  \,,
$$

In the middle we have the groupoid $(\mathbf{B}G)^I_\bullet$ whose objects are elements of $G$ and whose morphisms starting at some element are labeled by pairs of elements $h_1, h_2 \in G$ and end at $h_1 \cdot g \cdot h_2$. 
Using remark \ref{FiberProductsOfGroupoidsComponentwise} 
the limiting cone is seen to precisely pick those morphisms in $(\mathbf{B}G_\bullet)^I_\bullet$ such that these two elements are constant on the neutral element $h_1 = h_2 = e = id_{\ast}$, hence it produces just the elements of $G$ regarded as a groupoid with only identity morphisms, as in example \ref{SetAsGroupoid}.

###### Proposition


The [[free loop space object]] is

  $$
    [\Pi(S^1), X]
	\simeq
	X \underset{[\Pi(S^0), X]}{\times}X
  $$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Notice that $\Pi_1(S^0) \simeq \ast \coprod \ast$. Therefore
the [[path space object]] $[\Pi(S^0), X_\bullet]^I_\bullet$ has

* objects are pairs of morphisms in $X_\bullet$;

* morphisms are commuting squares of such.

Now the fiber product in def. \ref{HomotopyFiberProductOfGroupoids}
picks in there those pairs of morphisms for which both start at the same object, and both end at the same object. Therefore $X_\bullet \underset{[\Pi(S^0), X_\bullet]_\bullet}{\times} [\Pi(S^0), X_\bullet]^I_\bullet \underset{[\Pi(S^0), X_\bullet]_\bullet}{\times} X$ is the groupoid whose

* objects are diagrams in $X_\bullet$ of the form 

  $$
    \array{
       & \nearrow \searrow
       \\
       x_0 && x_1
       \\
       & \searrow \nearrow
    }
  $$

* morphism are cylinder-diagrams over these.

One finds along the lines of example 
\ref{BZIsPiSOne} that this is equivalent to maps from $\Pi_1(S^1)$ into $X_\bullet$ and homotopies between these.

###### Remark

Even though all these models of the circle $\Pi_1(S^1)$ are equivalent,
below the special appearance of the circle in the proof of 
prop. \ref{FreeLoopSpaceOfGroupoid} as the combination of two semi-circles will be important for the following proofs. 
As we see in a moment, this is the natural way in which the circle
appears as the composition of an [[evaluation map]] with a [[coevaluation map]].

+-- {: .num_example #AdjointActionGroupoidFromFreeLoopSpaceObject}
###### Example

For $G$ a [[discrete group]], the [[free loop space object]] of its [[delooping]] $\mathbf{B}G$ is $G//_{ad} G$, the [[action groupoid]], def. \ref{ActionGroupoid}, of the [[adjoint action]] of $G$ on itself:

$$
  [\Pi(S^1), \mathbf{B}G] \simeq G//_{ad} G

$$

+-- {: .num_example }
###### Example

For an [[abelian group]] such as $\flat U(1)$ we have

$$
  [\Pi(S^1), \mathbf{B}\flat U(1)]
  \simeq
  \flat U(1)//_{ad} \flat U(1)
  \simeq
  (\flat U(1)) \times (\mathbf{B}\flat U(1))

=--

+-- {: .num_example #GroupCharacterAsClassFunctionByFreeLoopSpace}
###### Example

Let $c \colon G \to \flat U(1)$ be a group homomorphism, hence a [[group character]]. By example \ref{DeloopingGroupoid} this has a [[delooping]] to a groupoid homomorphism 

$$
  \mathbf{B}c \;\colon\; \mathbf{B}G \to \mathbf{B}\flat U(1)
  \,.
$$

Under the [[free loop space object]] construction this becomes

$$
  [\Pi(S^1), \mathbf{B}c]
  \;\colon\;
  [\Pi(S^1), \mathbf{B}G]
  \to 
  [\Pi(S^1), \mathbf{B}\flat U(1)]

hence 

$$
  [\Pi(S^1), \mathbf{B}c]
  \;\colon\;
  G//_{ad}G
  \to 
  \flat U(1) \times \mathbf{B}U(1)
  \,.
$$

So by postcomposing with the [[projection]] on the first factor we recover from the general [[homotopy theory]] of groupoids the statement that a group character is a [[class function]] on [[conjugacy classes]]:

$$
  [\Pi(S^1), \mathbf{B}c]

##### Trajectories of fields: Correspondences of groupoids 
 {#CorrespondencesOfGroupoids}

With some basic [[homotopy theory]] of [[groupoids]] in hand, we can now talk about [[trajectories]] in finite gauge theories, namely about [[spans]]/[[correspondences]] of groupoids and their composition. These correspondences of groupoids encode [[trajectories]]/histories of [[field (physics)|field configurations]].

Namely consider a groupoid to be called $\mathbf{Fields} \in$ [[Grpd]], to be thought of as the [[moduli space]] of [[field (physics)|fields]] in some field theory, or equivalently and specifically as the [[target space]] of a [[sigma-model]] field theory. This just means that for $\Sigma$ any [[manifold]] thought of as [[spacetime]] or [[worldvolume]], the space of fields $\mathbf{Fields}(\Sigma)$ of the field theory on $\Sigma$ is the [[mapping stack]] ([[internal hom]]) from $\Sigma$ into $\mathbf{Fields}$, which means here for DW theory that it is the mapping groupoid, def. \ref{MappingGroupoid}, out of the fundamental groupoid, def. \ref{FundamentalGroupoid}, of $\Sigma$:
$$
  \mathbf{Fields}(\Sigma) = [\Pi_1(\Sigma), \mathbf{Fields}]
  \,.
$$

We think of the [[objects]] of the groupoid $[\Pi_1(\Sigma), \mathbf{Fields}]$ as being the fields themselves, and of the [[morphisms]] as being the [[gauge transformations]] between them.

The example to be of interest in a moment is that where $\mathbf{Fields} = \mathbf{B}G$ is a [[delooping]] groupoid as in def. \ref{DeloopingGroupoid}, in which case the fields are equivalently [[flat connection|flat]] [[principal connections]]. In fact in the discrete and 1-dimensional case currently considered this is essentially the only example, due to prop. \ref{DiscreteGroupoidIsDijointUnioonOfDeloopings}, but for the general idea and for the more general cases considered further below, it is useful to have the notation allude to more general moduli spaces $\mathbf{Fields}$.

The simple but crucial observation that shows why [[spans]]/[[correspondences]] of groupoids show up in prequantum field theory is the following.

+-- {: .num_example }
###### Example

If $\Sigma$ is a [[cobordism]], hence a [[manifold with boundary]] with incoming [[boundary]] component $\Sigma_{in} \hookrightarrow \Sigma$ and outgoing boundary components $\Sigma_{out} \hookrightarrow \Sigma$, then the resulting [[cospan]] of manifolds

$$
  \array{
    && \Sigma
    \\
    & \nearrow && \nwarrow
    \\
    \Sigma_{in}
    && &&
    \Sigma_{out}
  }
$$

is sent under the operation of mapping into the moduli space of fields

$$
  [\Pi_1(-), \mathbf{Fields}]
  \;\colon\;
  Mfds^{op} \to Grpd
$$

to a [[span]] of groupoids

$$
  \array{
    && [\Pi_1(\Sigma), \mathbf{Fields}]
    \\
    & \swarrow && \searrow
    \\
    [\Pi_1(\Sigma_{in}), \mathbf{Fields}]
    && &&
    [\Pi_1(\Sigma_{out}), \mathbf{Fields}]
  }
  \,.
$$

Here the left and right homomorphisms are those which take a field configuration on $\Sigma$ and restrict it to the incoming and to the outgoing field configuration, respectively. (And this being a homomorphism of groupoids means that everything respects the [[gauge symmetry]] on the fields.) Hence if $[\Pi_1(\Sigma_{in,out}),\mathbf{Fields}]$ is thought of as the spaces of incoming and outgoing field configurations, respectively, then  $[\Pi_1(\Sigma), \mathbf{Fields}]$ is to be interpreted as the space of [[trajectories]] (sometimes: _histories_) of field cofigurations over [[spacetimes]]/[[worldvolumes]] of shape $\Sigma$.

=--

This should make it plausible that specifying the field content of a 1-dimensional discrete gauge field theory is a functorial assignsment

$$
  \mathbf{Fields}
  \;\colon\;
  Bord_1
  \to Span(Grpd)
$$

from a [[category of cobordisms]] of dimension one into a category of such [[spans]] of groupoids. It sends points to spaces of field configurations on the point and 1-dimensional manifolds such as the circle as spaces of trajectories of field configurations on them.

Moreover, for a _local_ field theory it should be true that the field configurations on the circle, says, are determined from gluing the field configurations on any decomposition of the circle, notably a decomposition into two semi-circles. But since we are dealing with a [[topological field theory]], its field configurations on a contractible interval such as the semicircle will be equivalent to the field configurations on the point itself. 

The way that the fields on higher spheres in a topological field theory are induced from the fields on the point is by an analog of _[[traces]]_ for spaces of fields, and higher traces of such correspondences (the "[[span trace]]"). This is because by the [[cobordism theorem]], the field configurations on, notably, the [[n-sphere]] are given by the $n$-fold [[span trace]] of the field configurations on the point, the trace of the traces of the ... of the 1-trace. This is because for instance the 1-sphere, hence the [[circle]] is, regarded as a 1-dimensional [[cobordism]] itself pretty much manifestly a [[trace]] on the point in the [[string diagram]] formulation of traces.

$$
  \array{
     &&  \ast^- 
     \\
     & \swarrow & & \nwarrow
     \\
     \downarrow && && \uparrow
     \\
     & \searrow && \nearrow
     \\
     && \ast^+
  }
  \,.
$$

Here $\ast^+$ is the point with its potitive orientation, and $\ast^-$ is its [[dual object]] in the [[category of cobordisms]], the point with the reverse orientation. Since, by this picture, the construction that produces the circle from the point is one that involves only the [[coevaluation map]] and [[evaluation]] map on the point regarded as a [[dualizable object]], a [[topological field theory]] $Z \colon Bord_n \to Span_n(\mathbf{H})$, since it respects all this structure, takes the circle to precisely the same kind of diagram, but now in $Span_n(\mathbf{H})^\otimes$, where it becomes instead the [[span trace]] on the space $\mathbf{Fields}(\ast)$ over the point. This we discuss now.

Before talking about correspondences of groupoids, we need to organize the groupoids themselves a bit more.

are in [[natural bijection]] with [[homotopies]] of the form

where the function corresponding to this homotopy is that given by the unique factorization through the [[homotopy fiber product]] $\flat U(1) \simeq \ast \underset{\mathbf{B}\flat U(1)}{\times} \ast$ (example \ref{LoopSpaceGroupoid}) as shown on the right of

This means that if we have an [[action functional]] on a space of [[trajectories]], and if these trajectories are given by [[spans]]/[[correspondences]] of groupoids as discussed above, then the action functional is naturally expressed as the homotopy filling a completion of the span to a square diagram over $\mathbf{B}\flat U(1)$.

In conclusion, [[1-dimensional Dijkgraaf-Witten theory]] as a prequantum field theory comes down to be essentially a geometric interpretation of what [[group characters]] are and do. One may regard this as a simple example of [[geometric representation theory]]. Simple as this example is, it contains in it the seeds of many of the interesting aspects of richer prequantum field theories. 

#### 2d Dijkgraaf-Witten theory

The [[group character]] $c : G \to U(1)$ which defines 
1-dimensional prequantum Dijkgraaf-Witten theory
in [1d Dijkgraaf-Witten theory](#1dDWTheory) is equivalently a [[cocycle]] in degree-1 [[group cohomology]]

$$
  [c] \in H_{\mathrm{Grp}}(G,U(1))
  \,.
$$

More familiar are maybe cocycles in higher degree. 
In view of the above it is plausible that one may interpret a cocycle in degree-$n$ group cohomology, for 
all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ as a higher order [[action functional]]
$\mathbf{B}G \to \flat\mathbf{B}^n U(1)$ and induce an 
$n$-dimensional local prequantum Dijkgraaf-Witten-type theory
from it. 

Here we discuss the case of $n = 2$ where a group 2-cocycle is regarded as the local action functional of a 2-dimensional Digjkgraaf-Witten field theory. We use this as occasion to introduce a bit of the theory of [[2-groups]] and their [[homotopy theory]] ([[homotopy 2-type]]-theory). Below in _[3d DW theory](#3dDWLocalPrequantumFieldTheory)_ we then turn to the fully general case of [[∞-groupoid]]-theory.

Here we review how to formalize this and then consider the
example of DW theory in arbitrary dimension $n$.


##### Essence of higher gauge theory: $\infty$-Groupoids and basic homotopy theory
  {#EssenceOfHigherGaugeTheoryBasicHomotopyTheory}

We briefly recall here some basic definitions and facts of [[∞-groupoids]] and their [[homotopy theory]], geared towards their use in 3-dimensional [[Dijkgraaf-Witten theory]] and generally in [[∞-Dijkgraaf-Witten theory]].


###### Higher gauge transformations: Simplicial sets and Kan complexes
 {#HeuristicsOnCompositionAndInverses}

An [[∞-groupoid]] is first of all supposed to be a structure that consists of [[k-morphisms]] for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$, which for $k \geq 1$ go between $(k-1)$-morphisms. 

In the context of [[Kan complexes]], the tool for organizing such collections of [[k-morphisms]] is the notion of a _[[simplicial set]]_, which models $k$-morphisms as being of the [[geometric shape for higher structures|shape]] of $k$-[[simplices]] -- a [[vertex]] for $k = 0$, an [[edge]] for $k = 1$, a [[triangle]] for $k = 2$, a [[tetrahedron]] for $k = 3$, and so on. 

This means that a simplicial set $K_\bullet$ is a sequence of [[sets]] $\{K_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ (sets of $k$-simplex shaped $k$-morphisms for all $k$) equipped with [[functions]] $d_i \colon K_{k+1} \to K_{k}$ that send a $(k+1)$-simplex to its $i$-th face, and functions $s_i \colon K_k \to K_{k+1}$ that over a $k$-simplex "erects a flat $(k+1)$-simplex" in all possible ways (hence which inserts "[[identities]]" called "degeneracies" in this context).

If we write $\Delta$ for the [[category]] whose [[objects]] are abstract cellular [[simplices]] and whose morphisms are all cellular maps between these, then such a simplicial set is equivalently a [[functor]] of the form

$$
  K \colon \Delta^{op} \to Set
$$

Hence we think of this as assigning

* a set $[0] \mapsto K_0$ of [[objects]];

* a set $[1] \mapsto K_1$ of [[morphism]];

* a set $[2] \mapsto K_2$ of [[2-morphism]];

* a set $[3] \mapsto K_3$ of [[3-morphism]];

and generally

* a set $[k] \mapsto K_k$ of [[k-morphism]]s

as well as specifying

* functions $([n] \hookrightarrow [n+1]) \mapsto (K_{n+1} \to K_n)$
  that send $n+1$-morphisms to their boundary $n$-morphisms;

* functions $([n+1] \to [n]) \mapsto (K_{n} \to K_{n+1})$
  that send $n$-morphisms to [[identity]] $(n+1)$-morphisms
  on them.

The fact that $K$ is supposed to be a [[functor]] enforces that these assignments of sets and functions satisfy conditions that make consistent our interpretation of them as sets of $k$-morphisms and source and target maps between these. 
These are called the _[[simplicial identities]]_.

But apart from this source-target matching, a generic simplicial set does not yet encode a notion of [[composition]] of these morphisms. 

For instance for $\Lambda^1[2]$ the simplicial set consisting of two attached 1-cells 

$$
  \Lambda^1[2] = \left\{
    \array{
       && 1
       \\
       & \nearrow && \searrow
       \\
       0 &&&& 2
    }
  \right\}
$$

and for $(f,g) : \Lambda^1[2] \to K$ an image of this situation in $K$, hence a pair $x_0 \stackrel{f}{\to} x_1 \stackrel{g}{\to} x_2$ of two _composable_ 1-morphisms in $K$, we want to demand that there exists a third 1-morphisms in $K$ that may be thought of as the [[composition]] $x_0 \stackrel{h}{\to} x_2$ of $f$ and $g$. But since we are working in [[higher category theory]] (and not to be [[evil]]), we want to identify this composite only up to a [[2-morphism]] equivalence

$$
    \array{
       && x_1
       \\
       & {}^{\mathllap{f}}\nearrow &\Downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}& 
       \searrow^{\mathrlap{g}}
       \\
       x_0 &&\stackrel{h}{\to}&& x_2
    }
  \,.
$$

From the picture it is clear that this is equivalent to demanding that for $\Lambda^1[2] \hookrightarrow \Delta[2]$ the obvious inclusion of the two abstract composable 1-morphisms into the 2-simplex we have a diagram of morphisms of simplicial sets

$$
  \array{
    \Lambda^1[2] &\stackrel{(f,g)}{\to}& K
    \\
    \downarrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\exists h}}
    \\
    \Delta[2]
  }
  \,.
$$

A simplicial set where for all such $(f,g)$ a corresponding such $h$ exists may be thought of as a collection of higher morphisms that is equipped with a notion of composition of adjacent 1-morphisms. 

For the purpose of describing [[groupoid]]al composition, we now want that this composition operation has all [[inverse]]s. For that purpose, notice that for 

$$
  \Lambda^2[2] = \left\{
    \array{
       && 1
       \\
       & && \searrow
       \\
       0 &&\to&& 2
    }
  \right\}
$$

the simplicial set consisting of two 1-morphisms that touch at their end, hence for 

$$
  (g,h) : \Lambda^2[2] \to K
$$

two such 1-morphisms in $K$, then if $g$ had an inverse $g^{-1}$ we could use the above composition operation to compose that with $h$ and thereby find a morphism $f$ connecting the sources of $h$ and $g$. This being the case is evidently equivalent to the existence of diagrams of morphisms of simplicial sets of the form

$$
  \array{
    \Lambda^2[2] &\stackrel{(g,h)}{\to}& K
    \\
    \downarrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\exists f}}
    \\
    \Delta[2]
  }
  \,.
$$

Demanding that all such diagrams exist is therefore demanding that we have on 1-morphisms a composition operation with inverses in $K$. 

In order for this to qualify as an $\infty$-groupoid, this composition operation needs to satisfy an [[associativity law]] up to [[coherent]] [[2-morphisms]], which means that we can find the relevant [[tetrahedron]]s in $K$. These in turn need to be connected by _pentagonators_ and ever so on.  It is a nontrivial but true and powerful fact, that all these [[coherence]] conditions are captured by generalizing the above conditions to all dimensions as in the definition of Kan complexes.

In order to conceive of the $k$-[[simplices]] for higher $k$ as "[[globular set|globular]] [[k-morphism]]" going from a source to a target one needs a bit of combinatorics. This provided by the _[[orientals]]_ (due to [[Ross Street]]).

The $k$-[[oriental]] $O(k)$ is precisely the prescription for how exactly to think of  a $k$-[[simplex]] as being a [[k-morphism]] in an [[omega-category]]. The first few look like this:

$$
\array{\arrayopts{\rowalign{center}}
O(\Delta^0) = & \{ 0\} \\
O(\Delta^1) = & \left\{ 0 \to 1\right\} \\
O(\Delta^2) = & \left\{
\array{\begin{svg}
[[!include oriental > Delta2]]
\end{svg}}
\right\}\\
O(\Delta^3) = & \left\{
\array{\begin{svg}
[[!include oriental > Delta3]]
\end{svg}}\right\}\\
O(\Delta^4) = & \left\{
\array{\begin{svg}
[[!include oriental > Delta4]]
\end{svg}}
\right\}
}
$$

In fact, the [[omega-nerve]] $N(K)$ of an [[omega-category]] $K$ is the [[simplicial set]] whose collection of $k$-cells $N(K)_k := Hom(O(k),K)$ is precisely the collection of images of the $k$th oriental $O(k)$ in $K$.

This is fully formally the prescription of how to think of a Kan complex as an $\infty$-groupoid: the Kan complex $C$ is the [[omega-nerve]] of an [[omega-category]] in which all morphism are invertible:

* the $k$-cells in  $C_k$ are precisely the collection of $k$-morphisms ihn the omega-category of shape the $k$th [[oriental]] $O(k)$;

* the [[horn]]-filler conditions satisfied by these cells is precisely a reflection of the fact that

  1. there exists a notion of composition of adjacent k-morphisms in the [[omega-category]];

  1. under this composition all $k$-morphisms have an inverse.

This is easy to see in low dimensions: 

* a 1-cell $\phi \in C_1$ in the [[simplicial set]] $C$ has a single source 0-cell $x := d_1 \phi$ and a single target 0-cell $y := d_0 \phi$ and hence may be pictured as a [[morphism]]

  $$
    x \stackrel{\phi}{\to} y

    \,.
  $$

* a 2-cell $\phi \in C_2$ in the [[simplicial set]] $C$ has two incoming 1-cells $d_2 \phi, d_0 \phi \in C_1$ and one outgoing 1-cell $d_1 \phi \in C_1$, and if we think of the two incoming 1-cells as representing the composite of the corresponding 1-morphisms, we may picture te 2-cell $\phi$ here as a globular 2-morphism

  $$
    \array{
      && x_1
      \\
      & {}^{\mathllap{d_2 \phi}}\nearrow &\Downarrow^\phi& \searrow^{\mathrlap{d_0 \phi}}
      \\
      x_0 &&\underset{d_1 \phi}{\to}&& x_2
    }
    \,.
  $$

More in detail, one may think of the incoming two adjacent $1$-cells here as _not_ being the composite of these two morphism, but just as a [[composable pair]], and should think of the existence of the 2-morphism $\phi$ here as being a **compositor** in a [[bicategory]] that shows how the composable pair is composed to the morphism $d_1 \phi$.

So if an $\infty$-groupoid is thought of as a [[geometric shapes for higher structures|globular]] [[Batanin ω-category| ω-category]] in which all [[k-morphism]]s are invertible, then the corresponding Kan complex is the [[nerve]] or rather the [[ω-nerve]] of this [[ω-category]].

Notably if $C$ is to be regarded as (the nerve of) an ordinary [[groupoid]], every composable pair of morphisms has a unique composite, and hence there should be a _unique_ 2-cell

  $$

      && x_1

      & {}^{f}\nearrow &\Downarrow& \searrow^{g}

      x_0 &&\underset{h = g \circ f}{\to}&& x_2
    }
  $$

that is the unique **identity 2-morphism**

$$
  g \circ f \stackrel{=}{\Rightarrow} h
  \,.
$$

More generally, in a [[2-groupoid]] there may be non-identity 2-morphisms, and hence for any 1-morphism $k _ x_0 \to x_2$ 2-isomorphic to $h$, there may be many 2-morphisms $g \circ f \Rightarrow k$, hence many 2-cells

$$
  \array{
    && x_1
    \\
    & {}^{f}\nearrow &\Downarrow^{\simeq}& \searrow^{g}
    \\
    x_0 &&\underset{k }{\to}&& x_2
  }
  \,.
$$

All we can say for sure is that _at least_ one such 2-cell exists, and that the 2-cells themselves may be composed in some way. This is precisely what the horn-filler conditions in a Kan complex encode.

We have already seen in low dimension how the existence of composites in an $\omega$-category is reflected in the fact that in a Kan-complex certain 2-simplices exist, and how the non-uniqueness of these 2-simplices reflects the existence of nontrivial 2-morphisms.

To see in a similar fashion that the Kan condition ensures the existence of _inverses_ consider an _outer horn_ in $C$, a diagram of 1-cells of the form

$$
  \array{
    && x_1
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{f}}\nearrow
    \\
    x_0 &&\underset{h}{\to}&& x_2
  }
  \,.
$$

In general given such a diagram in a [[category]], there is no guarantee that the corresponding triangle as above will exist in its [[nerve]]. But if the category is a [[groupoid]], then it is guaranteed that the missing 1-face can be chose to be the [[inverse]] of $f$ composed with the morphism $h$, and there is at least one 2-morphism

$$
  \array{
    && x_1
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{f}}\nearrow
    &\Downarrow^{\simeq}& \searrow^{\mathrlap{h \circ f^{-1}}}
    \\
    x_0 &&\underset{h}{\to}&& x_2
  }
  \,.
$$

A similar analysis for higher dimensional cells shows that the fact that a Kan complex has all horn fillers encodes precisely the fact that it is the [[omega-nerve]] of an [[omega-category]] in which _all_ [[k-morphism]]s for all $k$ are composable if adjacent and have a weak inverse.

A ([[small category|small]]) _[[groupoid]]_ $\mathcal{G}_\bullet$ is

* $\circ$ defines a partial [[composition]] operation which is [[associativity|associative]] and [[unitality|unital]] for $i(\mathcal{G}_0)$ the [[identities]]; in particular

  $s (g \circ f) = s(f)$ and $t (g \circ f) = t(g)$;

the set of sequences of composable morphisms of length $n$, for $n \in \mathbb{N}$;

The degeneracy maps

are given by inserting an [[identity]] morphism on $x_k$.

###### Remark

Spelling this out in more detail: write

$$
  \mathcal{G}_n = 
  \left\{
    x_0

$$
  f_{i-1,i+1} \coloneqq f_{i,i+1} \circ f_{i-1,i}
$$

for the comosition of the two morphism that share the $i$th vertex. 

With this, face map $d_k$ acts simply by "removing the index $k$":

$$
  d_0
  \colon 
  (x_0 \stackrel{f_{0,1}}{\to}  x_1 \stackrel{f_{1,2}}{\to} x_{2} \cdots \stackrel{f_{n-1,n}}{\to} x_n )

$$


Similarly, writing

$$
  f_{k,k} \coloneqq id_{x_k}
$$

for the identity morphism on the object $x_k$, 
then the degenarcy map acts by
"repeating the $k$th index"

$$
  s_k

   $$
     \Xi \colon Ch_{\bullet \geq 0} \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} sAb

   sends a chain complex to the simplicial abelian group whose $n$-simplices are the images of the [[normalized chain complex]] $N(\mathbb{Z}(\Delta^n))$ of chains $\mathbb{Z}(\Delta^n)$ the $n$-[[simplex]].

for the composite of the two functors of prop. \ref{DoldKanAndMooreTheorem}.

We refer to this as the "Dold-Kan map", or say "by Dold-Kan", etc. It provides us with a rich supply of Kan complexes, hence of [[∞-groups]]. In fact, it embeds [[homological algebra]] into the [[homotopy theory]] of [[∞-groupoids]] in that it is a [[homotopical functor]]:

+-- {: .num_prop #DoldKanRespectsWeakEquivalences}

Notably we have the following example


+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ write

$$
  \mathbf{B}^n \flat U(1) \coloneqq DK(\flat U(1)[n])
  \in KanCplx
$$

for the $n$-fold [[suspension of a chain complex|suspension]] of the [[discrete group|discrete]] [[circle group]], regarded by Dold-Kan as the $n$-fold [[delooping]] Kan complex of $\flat U(1)$.

=--

+-- {: .num_example }
###### Example

Since the first [[simplex]] that contains a non-degenerate $n$-cell is $\Delta^n$, it follows that $\mathbf{B}^n\flat U(1)$ is trivial in degrees $\lt n$

$$
  (\mathbf{B}^n \flat U(1))_{k \lt n} = \ast
  \,.
$$

Then since there is a unique non-degenerate $n$-cell in $\Delta^n$ we next have

$$
  (\mathbf{B}^n \flat U(1))_{n} = \flat U(1)
  \,.
$$

Next there are $(n+2)$ non-degenrate $n$-simplices in $\Delta^{n+1}$, but known $n+1$ of their images in $\flat U(1)$ determines the last one (as their oriented product), hence next 

$$
  (\mathbf{B}^n \flat U(1))_{n+1} = (\flat U(1))^{\times^{n+1}}
  \,.
$$

Similarly for arbitary $k$ the set $(\mathbf{B}^n \flat U(1))_k$ is some [[Cartesian product|Cartesian power]] of $\flat U(1)$.
But cince here we are mostly interested in $\mathbf{B}^n \flat U(1)$ as an [[n-groupoid]], hence only for mapping $n$-groupoids into it, it is mostly enough to just know its cells up to degree $(n+1)$.

=--


Below in _[Higher Chern-Simons theory](#HigherChern-SimonsLocalPrequantumFieldTheory)_ the _smooth_ version of the [[circle group]] plays a role. In order to amplify that here we are just dealing with the [[discrete group]] underlying $U(1)$, we write

$$
  \flat U(1) \coloneqq U(1)_{disc}
$$

for it. 

$$
  \mathbf{B}^n \flat U(1) \coloneqq DK([U(1)_{disc}[n]])
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

By the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] each $\mathbf{B}^n \flat U(1)$ is
naturally an [[∞-group]] and its [[delooping]] is indeed $\mathbf{B}^{n+1}\flat U(1)$

$$

##### Local DW action functionals: Higher group cohomology


+-- {: .num_prop #GroupCohomologyByHomotopyClassesOfMaps}

For $G$ a [[discrete group]] and $A$ a discrete [[abelian group]], there is a natural isomorphism

$$
  H_{Grp}^n(G,A) \simeq \pi_0 Grpd_\infty(\mathbf{B}G, \mathbf{B}^n A)
$$

between the degree-$n$ [[group cohomology]] of $G$ with [[coefficients]] in $A$ and the connected components of maps of [[∞-groupoids]] from the [[delooping]] of $G$ to the $n$-fold [[delooping]] of $A$. 

=--


This means that local action functionals for higher Dijkgraaf-Witten type theories, hence maps of $\infty$-groupoids of the form 
$\exp(i S_{DW}^n) \colon \mathbf{B} \flat G \to \mathbf{B}^n \flat U(1)$ are equivalently [[cocycles]] $[c] \in H^n_{Grp}(\flat G,\flat U(1))$ in degree-$n$ [[group cohomology]]:

$$
  \exp(i S_{DW}^n) = \mathbf{B}c
  \,.
$$

In particular the original 3d [[Dijkgraaf-Witten theory]] appears this way as the theory of a group 3-cocycle.

This sends a closed manifold $\Sigma$ of dimension 2 (a [[surface]]) to  the class of a [[line bundle]]

$$
  \mathbf{Loc}_G(\Sigma) \longrightarrow B^2 \mathbb{Z}
$$

on the [[moduli stack of flat connections]] ("[[local systems]]") of $\Sigma$, which is the [[phase space]] of $G$-[[Chern-Simons theory]].

By the discussion at _[[cobordism hypothesis]]_ ([this corollary](cobordism+hypothesis#UnorientedLocalPrequantumFieldTheory) in view of [this proposition](cobordism+hypothesis#CanonicalSOActionOnBnZ)) an extension of this to an oriented-topological local preqauntum field theory is equivalent to 

1. choices of $SO(3)$-[[∞-actions]] on $\mathbf{B}G$;

1. choices of [[equivariant cohomology|equivariant]] extensions 

   $$
     \array{
         \mathbf{B}G &\stackrel{\mathbf{c}_2}{\longrightarrow}& B^4 \mathbb{Z}
        \\
        \downarrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\mathbf{c}_2//SO(3)}}
        \\
        (\mathbf{B}G)//SO(3)
     }
     \,.
   $$

There are in general not too  many $SO(3)$-[[∞-action]] on $\mathbf{B}G$, so consider the trivial one. Then

$$
  (\mathbf{B}G)//SO(3) \simeq (\mathbf{B}G)\times (B SO(3))
$$

and an equivariant extension is given by a map

$$
  B SO(3) \longrightarrow B^4 \mathbb{Z}
$$

hence an element in $H^4(B SO(3), \mathbb{Z})$. This is essentially given by the first [[Pontryagin class]]  $p_1$. Hence it follows that the extension of $\mathbf{c}_2$-Chern-Simons local prequantum fields theory (on the level of levels) to oriented cobordisms is given by

$$
  (c_2 + p_1) \colon (\mathbf{B}G) \times (B SO(3)) \longrightarrow B^4 \mathbb{Z}
  \,.
$$

The moduli space of fields that this assigns to an oriented manifold $\Sigma$ is the space of maps

$$
  \array{
     \Pi(\Sigma) && \longrightarrow && (\mathbf{B}G)\times (B SO(3))
     \\
     & {}_{\mathllap{T \Sigma \oplus \mathbb{R}^{3-dim(\Sigma)}}}\searrow
     && 
     \swarrow
     \\
     & B SO(3)
  }
  \,.
$$

Hence in codimension-0 this is still just $\mathbf{Loc}_G(\Sigma)$.

In order to trivialize the $p_1$-contribution appearing here, consider the  [[homotopy fiber sequence]]

$$
  \array{
     B^3 \mathbb{Z} &\longrightarrow& B^3 \mathbb{Z}//SO(3)
     \\
     && \downarrow 
     \\
     && B SO(3) &\stackrel{p_1}{\longrightarrow}&
  }
$$

exhibiting an $SO(3)$-[[∞-action]] on $B^3 \mathbb{Z}$. Then there is an oriented-topological local prequantum field theory with equivariant local Lagrangian

$$
  (c_2 + p_1) 
  \colon 
  (\mathbf{B}G) \times (B^3 \mathbb{Z}//SO(3))
  \longrightarrow
  B^4 \mathbb{Z}
$$

given by the total composite  in the diagram

$$
  \array{
     (\mathbf{B}G) \times (B^3 \mathbb{Z}//SO(3))
     &\longrightarrow&
     (B^3 \mathbb{Z})

     (\mathbf{B}G)\times B SO(3)

     && & \searrow^{\mathrlap{+}}
     \\
     && && B^4 \mathbb{Z}
  }
  \,.
$$

The moduli spaces of fields of this oriented theory on $\Sigma$ now are

$$
  \Sigma \mapsto \mathbf{Loc}_G(\Sigma) \times p_1Struct(\Sigma)
$$

with 3-stabilized $p_1$-structures as in _[[Atiyah 2-framing]]_.

A further  variant of this is given by the model for the [[supergravity C-field]]

$$

### Higher Chern-Simons local prequantum field theory
 {#HigherChern-SimonsLocalPrequantumFieldTheory}

By def. \ref{LocalPrequantumFieldWithAction}, a local prequantum [[bulk]] field theory in dimension $(n+1)$ is equivalently a morphism of the form 

$$
  \exp(i S) \colon \mathbf{Fields} \to \flat \mathbf{B}^{n+1}U(1)
  \,,
$$

for any object $\mathbf{Fields} \in \mathbf{H}$. 

First we now observe in 

* _[Universal topological Yang-Mills theory](#TopologicalYangMillsLocalPrequantumFieldTheory)_

that there is a fairly canonical such morphism $S^{n+1}_{tYM}$, namely the "[[atlas]] relative to [[manifolds]]" of $\flat \mathbf{B}^{n+1}U(1)$ given by the [[sheaf]] of [[differential forms|closed differential (n+1)-forms]]. Analyzing what this morphism is like, when regarded as a local prequantum field theory by def. \ref{LocalPrequantumFieldWithAction}, shows that it is the "universal" higher [[topological Yang-Mills theory|topological Yang-Mills]] prequantum field theory. What this means becomes clear when we analyze the possible [[boundary field theories]] of this theory. 

* _[Universal boundary condition for $S_{tYM}$:  Differential cohomology and Cheeger-Simons field theory
](#UniversalStYMBoundaryAndDifferentialCohomology)_

* [General boundary conditions: Higher Chern-Weil theory and $\infty$-Chern-Simons theory](#GenralBoundaryForStYMAndHigherChernSimons) 

where we discuss how the boundary theories for $S^{n+1}_{tYM}$ are precisely the prequantum field theories of higher [[Chern-Simons theory]]-type, the _[[schreiber:∞-Chern-Simons theories]]_. These include ordinary 3d [[Chern-Simons theory]], [[higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory]] on ordinary [[gauge fields]] but also higher Chern-Simons theory on [[higher gauge fields]] such as the [[String 2-group]] [[7-dimensional Chern-Simons theory]], the [[AKSZ sigma-models]], and also [[closed string field theory]].

This shows how $\infty$-Chern-Simons theories arise canonically as precisely the local [[boundary field theories]] of the canonical local field theory which exists in any [[differential cohesion|differential]] [[cohesion|cohesive]] [[(∞,1)-topos]].

Continuing in this vein we can then work out what all the further higher [[codimension]] [[boundary field theories]] and [[defect field theories]] of this universal higher [[topological Yang-Mills theory]] and hence of [[schreiber:∞-Chern-Simons theories]] are. We find

* _[Topological Chern-Simons boundaries]()_

which are given by generalized "[[Bohr-Sommerfeld leaf|Bohr-Sommerfeld]] [[isotropic subspaces]]" of the [[moduli stacks]] of $\infty$-Chern-Simons fields.

Then...

(...)


#### $d = n + 1$, Universal topological Yang-Mills theory $S_{tYM}$
 {#TopologicalYangMillsLocalPrequantumFieldTheory}

There is a special and especially simple map to the [[coefficient]] object  $\flat \mathbf{B}^{n+1} U(1)$ for flat [[local action functionals]]/[[prequantum n-bundles]], namely the map

$$
  \array{
    \Omega^{n+1}_{cl} 
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\exp(i S_{tYM})}}
    \\
    \mathbf{B}^{n+1} \flat U(1)
  }
$$

which in components is the inclusion of closed [[differential forms]] into [[de Rham cohomology|de Rham]] [[hypercohomology]] cocoycles. 

We here introduce and describe this map and then regard it as a [[local action functional]] of a local prequantum field theory according to def. \ref{LocalPrequantumFieldWithAction}. Below in _[Higher Chern-Simons prequantum field theory](#HigherChernSimonsPrequantumFieldTheory)_ we find that this field theory is such that close to its boundaries it looks like (higher) [[topological Yang-Mills theory]] for every possible higher gauge group and every possible [[invariant polynomial]] on it, as one considers every possible [[boundary condition]]. Therefore we here refer to this as the "universal topological Yang-Mills theory".

##### Smooth moduli stacks of fields: Smooth $\infty$-groupoids

The notion of a [[sheaf]] of [[chain complexes]] or equivalently of a chain complex of sheaves over a fixed [[topological space]] has a long tradition in [[homological algebra]]. Many sheaves however are naturally considered not on one fixed space, but on "all of them". For instance [[differential forms]] in any degree may be "[[pullback of a differential form|pulled back]]" along any [[smooth function]] between [[smooth manifolds]]. Accordingly if we regard the whole category [[SmoothMfd]] of smooth manifolds as a replacement for and generalization of the [[category of open subsets]] of any given one, then differential forms constitute a sheaf on that [[site]], hence a functor

$$
  \Omega^{n} \colon SmoothMfd^{op} \to Set
  \,.
$$

In particular for $n = 0$ this is just the sheaf of smooth functions

$$  
  \underline{\mathbb{R}} = C^\infty(-,\mathbb{R}) \colon SmoothMfd^{op} \to Set
  \,.
$$

One way to think of this is that this sheaf _is_ the [[real line]] $\mathbb{R}$ first of all as a [[set]] -- which is the value of $\underline{\mathbb{R}}$ on the [[point]] $\ast$ -- and secondly equipped with its canonical [[smooth structure]] which is encoded by the system of _all_ sets $C^\infty(X,\mathbb{R})$ of smooth functions from any smooth manifold $X$, and the information $C^\infty(\phi, \mathbb{R}) \colon C^\infty(Y, \mathbb{R}) \to C^\infty(X,\mathbb{R})$ of how these functions pull back (precompose) along any smooth function of test manifolds $\phi \colon X \to Y$.

Regarding the [[smooth manifold]] $\mathbb{R}$ this way means regarding it as what is sometimes called a [[diffeological space]], and what here more generally call a _[[smooth space]]_.

Therefore we will often just write $\mathbb{R}$ when we really mean the sheaf $\underline{\mathbb{R}}$ [[representable functor|represented]] by it.

The [[Dold-Kan correspondence|Dold-Kan map]] of def.  \ref{DoldKanMap} directly extends to ([[presheaf|pre]]-)[[sheaves]] which regard a (pre-)sheaf of chain complexes as a presheaf of [[Kan complexes]]

$$
  DK
  \;\colon\;
  pSh(SmoothMfd, Ch_\bullet)
  \stackrel{}{\to}
  pSh(SmoothMfd, KanCplx)
  \hookrightarrow
  pSh(SmoothMfd, sSet)
  \,.
$$

By the previous reasoning, a presheaf of Kan complexes on the category of smooth manifolds, we may think of as being a plain Kan complex, hence [[∞-groupoid]] (the value of the presheaf on the point), together with a rule for what the smooth functions into it are, for each smooth testmanifold. Hence we think of it as a _[[smooth ∞-groupoid]]_. 

A basic example is a [[Lie groupoid]] $\mathcal{G}_\bullet \in Grpd(SmoothMfd)$, which represents a presheaf of Kan complexes on smooth manifolds by

$$
  U \mapsto N( C^\infty(U,\mathcal{G}_1) \stackrel{\to}{\to} C^\infty(U,\mathcal{G}_0) )
  \,.
$$


Previously we have considered higher Dijkgraaf-Witten as taking place in the [[homotopy theory]] of plain [[∞-groupoids]] (geometrically [[discrete ∞-groupoids]]). Now we would like to have "a [[homotopy theory]] of [[smooth ∞-groupoids]]".

(A modern term for "a [[homotopy theory]]" is "an [[(∞,1)-category]]", but for a heuristic idea of what is going on some readers may find it helpful to think of "a homotopy theory" instead.)

In order to define "a [[homotopy theory]]" of [[smooth ∞-groupoids]] is, to be denoted [[Smooth∞Grpd]], we need to say what a [[homotopy]] and hence what a [[homotopy equivalence]] is supposed to be. Since [[smooth structure]] should be a local property witnessed on small smooth [[open balls]], we declare that

$$
  Smooth\infty Grpd
  \coloneqq
  L_{lhe} \; pSh(SmoothMfd, KanCplx)
$$

is the [[homotopy theory]] obtained by "universally turning [[stalk]]-wise [[homotopy equivalences]] of [[Kan complexes]], def. \ref{spring}, into actual homotopy equivalences". The formal definition of this idea is called the _[[simplicial localization]]_ of $pSh(SmoothMfd, KanCplx)$ at the stalkwise homotopy equivalences.

We call [[∞Grpd]] also the _[[differential cohesion|differential]] [[cohesive]] [[∞-topos]] of [[smooth ∞-groupoids]]_. For brevity and since most everything we discuss in the following holds for arbitrary _[[differential cohesion|differential]] [[cohesive]] [[(∞,1)-toposes]], we from now on denote it by

$$
  \mathbf{H} \coloneqq Smooth \infty Grpd
  \,.
$$

We now immediately turn to a simple example that illustrates some basic aspects of this construction. 


##### The canonical local action functional: Differential forms in de Rham hypercohomology

As a first example for how to work in the homotopy theory of [[smooth ∞-groupoids]] we have the following.

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition/Example

The canonical [[chain map]]

$$

    \flat U(1) &\to& 0 &\to& 0 &\to& \cdots &\to& 0

  }
  \,,
$$

where the left map includes the sheaf of (locally) constant $U(1)$-valued functions into that of all $U(1)$-valued smooth functions, is a [[stalk]]-wise [[quasi-isomorphism]]. Hence under the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]], def. \ref{DoldKanMap}, both present the same [[smooth ∞-groupoid]]

$$
  \flat \mathbf{B}^n U(1) \simeq \mathbf{B}^n \flat U(1)
  \in Smooth\infty Grpd
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By definition and using prop. \ref{DoldKanRespectsWeakEquivalences} we need to check that over a small enough smooth open ball, the [[chain map]] becomes a [[quasi-isomorphism]]. But on an open ball this is the statement of the [[Poincaré lemma]].

Accordingly we have a canonical inclusion:

$$
  \Omega^{n}_{cl} \to \flat \mathbf{B}^n U(1)

for the image in morphisms of [[Smooth∞Grpd]] under the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]], def. \ref{DoldKanMap}, of the [[chain map]]

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

The map $\Omega^n_{cl} \to \flat \mathbf{B}^n U(1)$ in def. \ref{ClosedFormsInDeRhamCoefficients} may be characterized more abstractly as follows:

for every [[smooth manifold]] $\Sigma$, theinduced morphism of [[mapping spaces]]

$$
  [\Sigma, \Omega^n_{cl}] \to [\Sigma, \flat \mathbf{B}^n U(1)]
$$

is a [[1-epimorphism]], hence a [[stalk]]-wise [[epimorphism]] on [[connected components]].

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #GeneralHighertYM}
###### Definition

By def. \ref{LocalPrequantumFieldWithAction} we may now regard the map

$$
  \array{
    \Omega^{n+1}_{cl}

  }
$$

of prop. \ref{ClosedFormsInDeRhamCoefficients} as a local action functional for an $(n+1)$-dimensional local prequantum field theory.
We call this the "universal higher [[topological Yang-Mills theory]]" for reasons that become clear as we anaylize its [[boundary field theories]] now.

=--

#### $d = n + 0$, Higher Chern-Simons field theories
 {#HigherChernSimonsPrequantumFieldTheory}

We consider now the [[boundary field theories]] for the "universal topological Yang-Mills theory" of def. \ref{GeneralHighertYM}.


##### Universal boundary condition for $S_{tYM}$:  Differential cohomology and Cheeger-Simons field theory
 {#UniversalStYMBoundaryAndDifferentialCohomology}


Where the plain [[(∞,n)-category of cobordisms]] $Bord_n$ is freely generated from the point $\ast$ alone, so the $(\infty,n)$-category of cobordisms with possibly a marked boundary is freely generated from the point and one new morphism

$$
  \emptyset \to \ast
$$


which we think of as being the interval $D^1$ with one end "marked". Now a local field theory with local action functional according to def. \ref{LocalPrequantumFieldWithAction} encodes not only the value on the point, which we now take to be

$$
  \exp(i S)
  \colon
  \ast 
  \mapsto
  \left[
  \array{
    \Omega^{n+1}_{cl}
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\exp(i S_{tYM})}}
    \\
    \mathbf{B}^{n+1} \flat U(1)
  }
  \right]
  \,,
$$

but moreover one morphism in $Span_n(\mathbf{H}, \mathbf{B}^{n+1}\flat U(1))$ from the trivial field configuration with trivial action to this data, hence (as amplified in [FV](#FiorenzaValentino)) a diagram in $\mathbf{H}$ of the form

$$
  \array{
     && \mathbf{Fields}^{\partial}
     \\
     & \swarrow && \searrow
     \\
    \ast && \swArrow && \Omega^{n+1}_{cl}
    \\
    & \searrow && \swarrow
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}^{n+1}\flat U(1)
  }
  \,.
$$

Therefore defining such boundary data means defining a [[moduli stack]] $\mathbf{Fields}^{\partial}$ of boundary field configurations, together with a [[homotopy]] filling the above diagram which encodes the relative action functional on this boundary data.

In order to find all possible such boundary data for $\exp(i S_{tYM})$, we can make use of the [[homotopy fiber product]] construction of def. \ref{HomotopyFiberProductOfKanComplexes} to find the _universal_ such boundary data, the one through which any other one factors.


+-- {: .num_prop #DiffCohomologyIsTerminalBoundaryForStYM}
###### Proposition

The universal boudnary condition for $\exp(i S_{tYM})$, hence the [[homotopy fiber product]] $\ast \underset{\mathbf{B}^{n+1}\flat U(1)}{\times} \Omega^{n+1}_{cl}$, is given by the image under the [[Dold-Kan correspondence|Dold-Kan map]], def. \ref{DoldKanMap}, of the [[Deligne complex]]

$$

hence the universal boundary data is

    & \searrow && \swarrow
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}^{n+1}\flat U(1)
  }
  \,.
$$

=--


The [[boundary field theory]] defined this way we may call _[[Cheeger-Simons differential character|Cheeger-Simons field theory]]_.

By the [[universal property]] of the [[homotopy fiber product]] we then have the following statement.

+-- {: .num_prop #HigherCSAsBoundaryTheory}

Boundary field theories for $\exp(i S_{tYM})$ are equivalently

  \exp(i S_{CS}) 
    \colon

$$

hence equipped with a [[circle n-bundle with connection]] (the [[prequantum n-bundle]] of the boundary theory).

=--

Moreover, the universal property of the [[Cheeger-Simons differential character|Cheeger-Simons]] field theory identifies all these boundary theories as being of higher Chern-Simons type, in that they have a [[curvature]] associated to them
which is an invariant differential form ([[invariant polynomial]]) on the moduli stack

$$

##### Geometric defects for $S_{tYM}$ from Chern-Simons invariants: Higher holonomy, parallel transport, fiber integration in differential cohomology


While we may think of the [[(∞,n)-category of cobordisms]] $Bord_n$ as built from [[smooth manifolds]], the [[cobordism theorem]] clearly states that these just serve as a presentation of a structure that is not intrinsically related to smooth or even topological structure. This is made manifest by prop. \ref{ValueOfLocalPrequantumFieldTheoryOnCobordism}: the value of a local prequantum field theory on a [[k-morphism]] in $Bord_n$ depends only on the [[homotopy type]] of the $k$-dimensional manifold that presents this $k$-morphism. Of course this is precisely the property that the term "topological" in _[[topological field theory]]_ is referring to.

But boundaries and defects of a topological field theory may add extra structure to the theory which is not "purely topological" in this way. Here we consider a canonical class of defects for universal higher topological Yang-Mills theory, def. \ref{GeneralHighertYM}, and $\infty$-Chern-Simons theory, def. \ref{HigherCSAsBoundaryTheory}, which implements the expected [[higher parallel transport]]/[[higher holonomy]] of the higher Chern-Simons type action functionals over actual [[smooth manifolds]].

which is compatible with the standard [[fiber integration|fiber]] [[integration of differential forms]] and with [[transgression]] in [[ordinary cohomology]] in that it fits into a commuting diagram

###### Proof

This follows by unwinding the traditional formulas for [[fiber integration in differential cohomology]], reformulating them in [[homotopy theory]] and observing that they are natural in their arguments, hence extend to morphisms of higher stacks, as discussed here.

###### Remark

A homotopy/gauge equivalence between a [[circle n-bundle with connection]] $(P,\nabla)$ and a trivial circle $n$-bundle with connection given by a globally defined differential form $(0,\omega)$ is equivalently a section/trivialization of the underlying [[circle n-bundle]]. Therefore the above says that the fiber integration of an $n$-connection over a manifold with boundary is equivalently a section of the transgression of the underlying bundle to the boundary.

We may combine this with the $\infty$-Chern-Simons action functional:

###### Definition

Let $\exp(i S_{CS}) \colon \mathbf{Fields} \to \mathbf{B}^n U(1)_{conn}$ be an [[schreiber:∞-Chern-Simons theory]] [[local action functional]] as in prop. \ref{HigherCSAsBoundaryTheory}. Then for $\Sigma_k$ an [[orientation|oriented]] [[smooth manifold|smooth]] $k$-[[dimension|dimensional]] [[manifold with boundary]], the corresponding **transgression defect** is the [[pasting]]-composite

  \array{
    && && [\Sigma, \mathbf{Fields}]

    && & {}^{\mathllap{(-)|_{\partial \Sigma}}}\swarrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{[\Sigma_k, \exp(i S_{CS})]}}
    \\
    && [\partial \Sigma, \mathbf{Fields}] && && [\Sigma_k, \mathbf{B}^n U(1)_{conn}]

    \\
    && && && \mathbf{B}^{n-k+1}U(1)_{conn}

or rather its further pullback to the [[shape modality]]

$$
  \array{
    && [\Pi(\Sigma), \mathbf{Fields}]
    \\
    & \swarrow

This is a defect between the boundary transgression, def. \ref{FiberIntegrationInDiffCohomologyAsDiagram}, of the $\infty$-Chern-Simons theory and the tautological higher differential higher Chern-Simons theory. 

We see below that both the [[Wess-Zumino-Witten theory]] as well as [[Wilson lines]] in Chern-Simons theory arise from transgression defects this way.
