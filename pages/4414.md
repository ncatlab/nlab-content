## Idea

A _planar algebra_ $\mathcal{P}$ consists of vector spaces $P_n$ together with multilinear operations between them indexed by planar tangles -- large discs
with internal ("input") discs all connected up by non-intersecting curves
called strings. Thus a planar algebra may be thought of as made up
from generators $R_i \in P_n$ to which linear combinations of planar tangles
may be applied to obtain all elements of $\mathcal{P}$.

where the author remarks

> The definition of a planar algebra has evolved a bit since the original one in [Planar algebras I](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/9909027) so we give a detailed definition which is, we hope, the ultimate one, at least for shaded planar algebras.

> Relations will appear with [[knot theory]], [[statistical mechanics]], combinatorial [[group theory]], [[quantum groups]] and most of all, [[subfactors]]. They lead to many different algebraic structures according to the particular planar tangles chosen. Of particular interest recently have been graded algebra structures which give connections with the large $N$ limit of random matrices and free probability.
