## Idea

This page describes a proposal for a formalization of the concept of [[quantization]] (from  [[local prequantum field theory]] to [[local quantum field theory]]) formulated in terms of [[cohomology]] in [[higher differential geometry]], specifically in [[cohesive (∞,1)-toposes]].

The basic observation is that is natural to 

1. (**prequantum fields**) -- identify spaces of [[trajectories]] of [[field (physics)|fields]] as [[correspondences]] of higher [[moduli stacks]], hence objects of a [[base (∞,1)-topos]];

1. (**local action functionals**) -- identify [[local action functionals]] as lifts of these [[correspondences]] to the [[slice (∞,1)-topos|slice]] of the base $\infty$-topos over an [[∞-group of units]] of a suitably [[E-∞ ring]] object $E$;

1. (**path integral**) -- identify the [[path integral]] [[quantization]] of these local action functionals on spaces of trajectories as the [[path integral as a pull-push transform|pull-push]] operation in [[twisted cohomology|twisted]] $E$-[[cohomology theory]].

Here a [[correspondence]] 

$$
  \array{
    && \mathbf{Trajectories}
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{i_1}}\swarrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{i_2}}
    \\
    \mathbf{Fields}_{in}
    && \swArrow_{\xi} &&
    \mathbf{Fields}_{out}
    \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
    \in \mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}GL_1(E)}
    \\
    & {}_{\chi_{in}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\chi_{out}}
    \\
    && \mathbf{B} GL_1(E)
  }
$$

in the [[slice (∞,1)-topos]] is equivalently a [[correspondence]] of [[spaces]] equipped with a [[cocycle]] $\xi \in H^{\bullet + i_{in}^\ast \chi_{in} + i_{out}^\ast \chi_{out}}(\mathbf{Fields}_{in}, \mathbf{Fields}_{out}; E)$ in [[bivariant cohomology]] $(i_{in}^\ast \chi_{in}, i^\ast_{out} \chi_{out})$-[[twisted cohomology|twisted]] $E$-[[cohomology]] on its correspondence space, and the quantization step takes this to the [[equivalence class]] of maps of $E$-[[∞-modules]] that it induces under [[fiber integration in generalized cohomology]]:

$$
  \Gamma(\chi_{in})
  \stackrel{\;\;\;\;\; \underset{i_2}{\int} i_1^\ast \xi \;\;\;\;\;}{\to}
  \Gamma(\chi_{out})
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \in E \mathbf{Mod}
  \,.
$$

Since this process is analogous to how [[Chow motives]] induce cocycles in [[motivic cohomology]] (an observation which for $E = $ [[K-theory spectrum|KU]] was amplified in ([Connes-Skandalis 84](#ConnesSkandalis84), [Connes-Consani-Marcolli 05](#ConnesConsaniMarcolli05))) it may be useful to refer to this process as _[[motive|motivic]] quantization_. Just as the idea of a category of [[motives]] is to constitute a "linearization" or "abelianization" of a category of [[spaces]], so [[quantization]] is a process that sends (non-linear) spaces of field configurations to linear [[spaces of quantum states]]. This linearization by which [[quantum states]] may be added as elements of an [[abelian group]] encodes the [[superposition principle]] and hence [[quantum interference]], the hallmark of [[quantum physics]].

In the following we first lay out the basic definitions of motivic quantization in 

* _[General theory](#GeneralTheory)_

and then we discuss a list of examples in 

* _[Examples](#Examples)_

## General theory
 {#GeneralTheory}

Let $\mathbf{H}$ be a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]]. Write $(\Pi \dashv \flat \dashv \sharp)$ for the corresponding [[shape modality]], [[flat modality]], [[sharp modality]], respectively.

Write

* $Grp(\mathbf{H})$ for the [[(∞,1)-category]] of [[∞-group]] objects in $\mathbf{H}$;

* $Sp(\mathbf{H})$ for the [[stable (∞,1)-category]] of [[spectrum objects]] in $\mathbf{H}$;

* $CRing(\mathbf{H}) \coloneqq E_\infty Alg(Sp(\mathbf{H}))$ for the [[(∞,1)-category]] of [[E-∞ ring]] objects in $\mathbf{H}$;

* $E Mod(\mathbf{H})$ for the [[symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category]] of $E$-[[∞-modules]] in $\mathbf{H}$.
