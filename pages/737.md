The _Courant Lie algebroid_ is a certain [[Lie infinity-algebroid]] concentrated in degrees 0 to 3. It was originally introduced by T. Courant to study [[geometric quantization]] in the presence of constraints, but became of interest in its own right. 

There are various different-looking definitions of Courant Lie algebroids and in parts of the literature a clear notion of morphisms and equivalences is missing. The picture was eventually clarified in particular by work of Dmitry Roytenberg.

The two main definitions differ in that

* in one there is a skew-symmetric bracket which fails to satisfy a Jacobi identity by a coherent term;

* in the other there is a bracket which satisfies a Jacobi identity but is skew-symmetric only up to a correction term.

This has eventually led Dmitry Roytenberg in _Roytenberg07_ (see below) to identify the concept of a [[hemistrict Lie 2-algebra]] in which both the Jacobi identity and the skew symmetry may be weakened and clarify its relation to semistrict Lie 2-algebras which are strictly skew symmetric but may have a nontrivial Jacobiator.

The nature of Courant's original definition as an $L_\infty$-structure was recognized in _RoytenbergWeinstein98_ (see references below). Equation (9) and theorem 4.3 there gives the [[L-infinity algebra|Lie 3-algebra]] corresponding to a Courant Lie algebroid (the way the tangent Lie algebroid gives the Lie algebra of vector fields). This perspective makes manifest that the Courant Lie algebroid with base space a point is the [[String Lie 2-algebra]].

This was further developed in the thesis _Roytenberg99_.
