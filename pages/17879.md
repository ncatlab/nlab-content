## Idea

In [[physics]] the term _[[Wilson loop]]_ refers to an [[observable]] in [[gauge field theory]] given by the [[holonomy]] of the given [[gauge field]] [[connection on a principal bundle|connection]] along a fixed curve.

In [[higher gauge theory]] one correspondingly has [[observables]] given by [[higher holonomy]] around higher dimensional manifolds, such as [[surfaces]] etc. These are hence sometimes called "Wilson surfaces" etc.
