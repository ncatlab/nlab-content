In 1981 D'Auria and Fr&eacute; noticed, in [GeSuGra](#References), that the intricacies of various [[supergravity]] [[classical field theory|classical field theories]] have a strikingly powerful reformulation in terms of [[semifree dga|semifree differential graded-commutative algebra]]s. 

Here we describe this formalism in the way it is usually presented, and at the same time discuss the following useful re-interpretation:

+-- {: .standout}

**Abstract nonsense reinterpretation** of the D'Auria-Fr&eacute; formalism:

The theory of [[supergravity]] (at least as a [[classical field theory]]) is a theory of [[schreiber:Cartan-Ehresmann ∞-connection|Cartan-Ehresmann ∞-connection]]s with values in the [[supergravity Lie 3-algebra]] $\mathfrak{sugra}(10,1)$.

This identifies field configurations of supergravity with [[connection on a bundle|connections]] on certain [[principal ∞-bundle]]s.

=--

The pivotal concept that allows to pass between this interpretation and the D'Auria-Fr&eacute;-formalism is the concept of [[schreiber:∞-Lie algebroid|∞-Lie algebroid]] with its various incarnations:

+-- {: .standout}

**Incarnations of $\infty$-Lie algebroids**

A (super) [[schreiber:∞-Lie algebroid|∞-Lie algebroid]] 

* is an [[infinitesimal space|infinitesimal]] (super)[[schreiber:∞-Lie groupoid|∞-Lie groupoid]]

* that may be modeled as a [[simplicial object|simplicial]] (super) [[infinitesimal space]]

* whose [[schreiber:∞-quantity|∞-quantity]] of functions is a [[cosimplicial algebra|cosimplicial]] ([[super algebra|super]]) algebra

* that under the [[monoidal Dold-Kan correspondence]] maps to a (super) [[semifree dga|semifree differential graded-commutative algebra]]: the [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] of the (super) [[schreiber:∞-Lie algebroid|∞-Lie algebroid]].

=--

Notably the [[semifree dga]] that D'Auria-Fr&eacute; base the description of 11-dimensioonal [[supergravity]] on is the [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] of the [[supergravity Lie 3-algebra]], which is an [[L-infinity-algebra|∞-Lie algebra]] that is a higher central extension 

$$
  0 \to b^2 \mathfrak{u}(1)
  \to \mathfrak{sugra}(10,1)
  \to
  \mathfrak{siso}(10,1)
  \to
  0
$$

of a [[super Poincare Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{siso}(10,1)$ in the way the [[String Lie 2-algebra]] $\mathfrak{string}(n)$ is a higher central extension of $\mathfrak{so}(n)$.

A super [[schreiber:Cartan-Ehresmann ∞-connection|Cartan-Ehresmann ∞-connection]] with values in $\mathfrak{sugra}(10,1)$ on a [[supermanifold]] $X$ is locally given by [[schreiber:∞-Lie algebroid valued differential forms|∞-Lie algebroid valued differential forms]] consisting of

* a $\mathbb{R}^{11}$-valued 1-form $e$ 

* a $\mathfrak{so}(10,1)$-valued 1-form $\omega$

* a spin-representation valued 1-form $\psi$

* a 3-form $C$ .

These are identified with the fields of 11-dimensional [[supergravity]], respectively:

* the _graviton_ $(e, \omega)$

* the _gravitino_ $\psi$

* the _[[supergravity C-field]]_ $C$ .


By realizing this data as components of a Lie 3-algebra valued connection (more or less explciitly), the D'Auria-Fr&eacute;-formalism achieves some conceptual simplication of 

* the construction of supersymmetric [[supergravity]] [[action functional]]s;

* the determination of the corresponding classical equations of motion.


## _nomen est omen_ - the higher gauge theory reinterpretation ##

Originally D'Auria and Fr&eacute; referred to commutative [[semifree dga]]s as as _Cartan integrable systems_ . Later the term _free differential algebra_, abbreviated _FDA_ was used instead and became popular. Nowadays much of the literature that studies commutative [[semifree dga]]s in [[supergravity]] refers to them as "FDA"s. One speaks of the _FDA approach to supergravity_ . 

But strictly speaking "free differential algebra" is a misnomer: genuinely free differential algebras are pretty boring objects. Crucially it is _only_ the underlying graded commutative algebra which is required to be free as a graded commutative algebra in that it is a [[Grassmann algebra]] $\wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^*$ on a [[graded vector space]] $\mathfrak{g}^*$. The differential on that is in general not free, hence the more precise term _[[semifree dga]]_ . 

In fact, when $\mathfrak{g}$ is concentrated in non-positive degree (so that $\wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^*$ os concentrated in non-negative degree) the differential on $\wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^{*}$ encodes all the structure of an [[L-infinity algebroid|∞-Lie algebroid]] on $\mathfrak{g}$. If $\mathfrak{g}$ is concentrated in negative degree the differential encodes the structure of an [[L-infinity algebra|∞-Lie algebra]] on $\mathfrak{g}$. This interpretation of [[semifree dga]]s in [[Lie theory]] is the key to our _abstract nonsense reformulation_ of the D'Auria-Fr&eacute;-formalsim.

Already D'Auria and Fr&eacute; themselves, and afterwards other authors, have tried to better understand the intrinsic conceptual meaning of their [[dg-algebra]] formalism that happened to be so useful in [[supergravity]]: 

the idea arose and then became pupular in the "FDA"-literature that the D'Auria-Fr&eacute;-formalism should be about a concept called **soft group manifolds**. This is motivated from the observation that by means of the [[dg-algebra]] formulation the fields in [[supergravity]] arrange themselves into systems of [[differential form]]s that satisfy equations structurally similar to the Maurer-Cartan forms of left-inavriant differential forms on a [[Lie group]] -- _except_ that where the ordinary Maurer-Cartan equation has a "0" on one side, these equations for supergravity fields have there the possibly non-vanishing [[field strength]]. These generalized Maurer-Cartan equations are suggested in the "FDA"-literature to describe generalized or "softened" group manifolds.

However, even when the field strenghts do vanish does the remaing collection of differential forms not constrain the base manifold to be a group. Rather, if the field strenghs do vanish we have a natural interpretation of the remaining differential form data as being flat [[schreiber:∞-Lie algebroid valued differential forms|∞-Lie algebroid valued differential forms]], given by a morphism

$$
  A : T X \to \mathfrak{g}
$$

from the [[tangent Lie algebroid]] of the base [[manifold]] $X$ to the [[L-infinity-algebra|∞-Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ encoded by the [[semifree dga]] in question. In fact, applying the functor from [[Lie infinity-algebroid|∞-Lie algebroid]]s to [[dg-algebra]]s given by forming [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]]s, the above morphism turns into a [[dg-algebra]] morphism

$$
  \Omega^\bullet(X)
  \leftarrow
  CE(\mathfrak{g})
  :
  A
$$

to the [[deRham dg-algebra]] of $X$ (which we denote by the same letter, by convenient abuse of notation).

Since $CE(\mathfrak{g})$ is semifree, this is a map of [[graded vector space]]s 

$$
  \Omega^\bullet(X)
  \leftarrow
  \mathfrak{g}^*
  :
  A
$$

together with a constraint that imposes the respect of the morphism for the differentials on $CE(\mathfrak{g})$ and on $\Omega^\bullet(X)$. Such a morphism of graded vector spaces in canonically identified with a $\mathfrak{g}$-valued differential form (recall that $\mathfrak{g}$ is a  [[graded vector space]])

$$ 
  \omega \in \Omega^\bullet(X,\mathfrak{g})
$$

and the remaining constraint is precisely the Maurer-Cartan-like equation that is known from left-invariant 1-fomrs on a [[Lie group]]. In fact, for $G$ a [[Lie group]] with [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ there is a canonical morphism

$$
  \Omega^\bullet(G)
  \leftarrow
  CE(\mathfrak{g})
$$

whose image are precisely the left-invariant 1-forms on the [[Lie group]] $G$ and whose respect for the differentials is precisely the ordinary Maurer-Cartan equation. 

To see the role of group manifolds for more general morphisms

$$
  \Omega^\bullet(X)
  \leftarrow
  CE(\mathfrak{g})
  :
  A
$$

one has to apply [[Lie integration]] of the [[Lie infinity-algebroid|∞-Lie algebroid]] morphism $T X \to \mathfrak{g}$ to a morphism of [[Lie infinity-groupoid|∞-Lie groupoid]]s

$$
  \Pi(X) \to \mathbf{B}G
$$
 
where $\Pi(X)$ is the [[path infinity-groupoid|path ∞-groupoid]] and where $\mathbf{B}G$ is the [[delooping]] of an [[n-group]] $G$ that integrates the [[L-infinity-algebra|Lie n-algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$.
Such morphisms are the integrated version of flat [[schreiber:∞-Lie algebroid valued differential forms|∞-Lie algebroid valued differential forms]].

The theory of [[schreiber:Cartan-Ehresmann ∞-connection|Cartan-Ehresmann ∞-connections]] is about 

1. the generalization of such flat form data to [[schreiber:∞-Lie algebroid valued differential forms|∞-Lie algebroid valued differential forms]] with [[schreiber:curvature|∞-Lie algebroid valued curvature]].

1. the generalization from globally defined differential form data -- which are connections on _trivial_ [[principal ∞-bundle]]s -- to [[schreiber:theory of differential nonabelian cohomology|differential cocycles]] encoding connections on arbitrary [[principal ∞-bundle]]s.

The D'Auria-Fr&eacute;-formalism, after our re-interpretation, is about the first of these points. So as an immediate gain of our reformlation of D'Auria-Fr&eacute;-formalism in terms of [[schreiber:Cartan-Ehresmann ∞-connection|Cartan-Ehresmann ∞-connection]]s we obtain, using the second of these points, a natural proposal for a formulation of [[supergravity]] field configurations that are globally topologically nontrivial. Physicists speak of **instanton solutions**.

In fact, 

+-- {: .standout}

our reformulation exhibits the D'Auria-Fr&eacute;-formalism as being secretly the realization of [[supergravity]] as a higher [[gauge theory]].

=--

In fact, it realizes supergravity as an example for a _nonabelian_ higher gauge theory in that a [[supergravity]] field configuration is not realizable as a cocycle in [[differential cohomology|abelian differential cohomology]] as in ordinary abelian higher [[gauge theory]] (see there) but as a cocycle in [[schreiber:Differential Nonabelian Cohomology|differential nonabelian cohomology]].



# Details #

## the supergravity Lie 3-algebra ##

recall [[supergravity Lie 3-algebra]] $\mathfrak{sugra}(10,1)$

...

## super Lorentzian spacetime manifolds ##

The base space $X$ on which a [[supergravity]] field is a super Lie $n$-algebra valued [[schreiber:Cartan-Ehresmann infinity-connection|...]] is a [[supermanifold]].

In particular, for constructing the [[action functional]] of [[supergravity]] we want $X$ to locally look like [[super Minkowski space]].


## field configuration and field strength ##


A local field configuration on a [[supermanifold]] $X$ in the [[classical field theory]] is a morphism
 
$$
  \Pi^{inf}(X) \stackrel{(A, F_A)}{\to}
  inn(\mathfrak{sugra}(\mathfrak{g}))
$$

from the [[schreiber:infinitesimal path ∞-groupoid|infinitesimal path ∞-groupoid]] to the inner-derivation Lie 4-algebra $inn(\mathfrak{sugra}(10,1))$. Dually this is a morhism of [[dg-algebra]]s from the [[Weil algebra]] $W(\mathfrak{sugra}(10,1))$ to the [[deRham dg-algebra]] $\Omega^\bullet(X)$ of $X$:

$$
  \Omega^\bullet(X)
   \leftarrow
   W(\mathfrak{sugra}(10,1))
   :
   (A,F_A)  
   \,.
$$

This is [[schreiber:∞-Lie algebroid valued differential forms|∞-Lie algebroid differential form data]] with [[schreiber:curvature|∞-Lie algebroid valued curvature]] that is explicitly given by:


* connection forms / field configuration

  * $E \in \Omega^1(X,\mathbb{R}^{10,1})$ -- the **vielbein** (part of the _graviton field_)

  * $\Omega \in \Omega^1(X, \mathfrak{so}(10,1))$ -- the **spin connection** (part of the _graviton field_)

  * $\Psi \in \Omega^ 1(X,S)$ -- the **spinor** (the gravitino field)

  * $C \in \Omega^3(X)$ -- a 3-form (the [[supergravity C-field]])

* [[schreiber:curvature|curvature]] forms / [[field strength]]s

  * $T = d E + \Omega \cdot E + \Gamma(\bar \Psi \wedge \Psi) \in \Omega^2(X,\mathbb{R}^{10,1})$ - the **torsion**

  * $R = d \Omega + [\Omega \wedge \Omega] \in \Omega^2(X, \mathfrak{so}(10,1))$ - the **Riemann curvature**

  * $\rho = d \Psi + (\Omega \wedge \Psi) \in \Omega^2(X, S)$ -- the **covariant derivative of the spinor**

  * $G = d C + \mu_4(\psi, E) \in \Omega^4(X)$ -- the **4-form field strength**

> need to fill in content here. The main point is this:

> while the fields $\Pi^{inf}(X) \to \mathfrak{sugra}(10,11)$ are in principal general [[super differential form]]s, in the desired physical theory these satisfy a strong constraint which makes their _components_ behave like ordinary functions on the ordinary manifold $X_{red}$ underlying $X$. This stemps from the fact that fields in naturre are percieved as fields on an ordinary spacetime manifold $X_{red}$, not on a genuine supermanifold $X$. So there is a constraint to be imposed on the fields.

> D'Auria-Fr&eacute; noticed that there is a very good way to model/formalize: we should be looking at functions on a $(d|d)$-dimensional [[supermanifold]]  that are however "independent" in some sense of the "supercoordinates": namely in a way entirely analogous to how a [[holomorphic funtion]] on a [[complex manifold]] is "independent of half of the coordinates". 

> so the full statement to be discussed here is really that classical field configurations are **holomophic $\infty$-functors** $\Pi^{inf}(X) \to \mathfrak{sugra}(10,1)$ for a suitable notion of "holomorphic".

> this super-version of "holomorphicity" is what is called **rheonomy**. A field $\Pi^{inf}(X) \to \mathfrak{g}$ on the [[supermanifold]] $X$ "satisfies the rheonomy constraints" if it is "holomorphic" in this sense.
