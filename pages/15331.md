[[!redirects SOL]]

## Idea

_Second-order logic_(SOL) is an extension of [[first-order logic]] with quantifiers and variables that range over subsets of the universe of discourse, and hence is a [[higher-order logic]] of stage 2.

An important fragment is _Monadic Second-order logic_  (MSOL), where second-order quantification is restricted to second-order unary relations between subsets i.e. MSOL quantifies only over set predicates e.g. $\forall X.\varphi(X)$ but not $\forall X\forall Y .\varphi(X,Y)$.

##Remark
As SOL permits characterization of mathematical structures up to isomorphism, it is sometimes promoted as a contender to [[set theory]] for the [[foundations of mathematics]] (cf. references).
