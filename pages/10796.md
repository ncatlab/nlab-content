## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A [[topological space]] is called _extremally disconnected_ if the [[closure]] of any [[open subset]] is still an open subset.

=--


## Properties

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem (Gleason)

Extremally disconnected topological spaces are precisely the [[projective objects]] in the [[category]] of [[compact topological space|compact]] [[Hausdorff topological spaces]].

=--

See e.g. ([Bhatt-Scholze 13, below theorem 1.8](BhattScholze13))

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

For $R$ a [[w-contractible ring]], the [[profinite set]] $\pi_0(Spec R)$
is an extremally disconnected [[profinite set]].

Part of ([Bhatt-Scholze 13, theorem 1.8](#BhattScholze13))



## Examples

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

For $S$ any [[set]] regarded as a [[discrete topological space]],
its [[Stone-Cech compactification]] is extremally disconnected.

=--

(e.g. [Bhatt-Scholze 13, example 2.4.6](#BhattScholze13))

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Counter-Example

The [[profinite set]] underlying the [[p-adic integers]], regarded as a [[Stone space]], is _not_ extremally diconnected.

=--

(e.g. [Bhatt-Scholze 13, example 2.4.7](#BhattScholze13))
