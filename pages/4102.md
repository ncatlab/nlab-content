## Definition

A [[morphism]] $f\colon A\to B$ in a [[2-category]] $K$ is said to be **(representably) conservative** if for all objects $X$, the induced [[functor]]
$$K(X,A) \to K(X,B)$$
is [[conservative functor|conservative]].  In [[Cat]], this is equivalent to $f$ being conservative in the usual sense.

## Remarks

* Conservative morphisms often form the right class of a [[factorization system in a 2-category|factorization system]].  In [[Cat]], the left class consists of (possibly [[transfinite composition|transfinitely]]) iterated [[localizations]].

* Of course, any [[fully faithful morphism]] is also conservative, and in particular any [[inverter]] or [[equifier]] is conservative.  Moreover, any [[inserter]] is also conservative (and [[faithful morphism|faithful]]), though not generally fully-faithful.

* If $f$ is conservative in $K^{op}$ (the [[opposite 2-category|1-cell dual]]), then $f$ is said to be **liberal**.  This joke is due to Carboni, Johnson, Street, and Verity; see [[codiscrete cofibration]].
