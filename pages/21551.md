## Idea

Although it has less emphasis in advanced mathematics, and although its definition is more complicated than that of the [[limit of a sequence]], the first concept of limit seen by most students is that of a limit of a [[function]].  This is the idea that
$$ \lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L $$
means that $f(x)$ is close to $L$ if $x$ is sufficiently close to $c$.  Of course, $x$ here is just a dummy variable, so this is really a [[ternary relation]] between $f$, $c$, and $L$.


## Definitions

Let $X$ and $Y$ be [[topological spaces]], let $f$ be a [[partial function]] from $X$ to $Y$ (*not* assumed continuous or anything else), let $c$ be a [[limit point]] of the domain $D$ of $f$ in $X$, and let $L$ be a point in $Y$.

There are actually two definitions of 'limit point' in the literature: an [[adherent point]] and an [[accumulation point]].  And there are two definitions of 'limit' in this context: the usual French-language one (following [[Bourbaki]]) and the usual English-language one.  These definitions correspond respectively.  In both cases, the first definition is simpler, while the second is more common.

###### Definition
**(French)**

$L$ is a __limit__ of $f$ approaching $c$ (assumed to be an adherent point of the domain $D$) if, for each [[neighbourhood]] $V$ of $L$, for some neighbourhood $U$ of $c$, for each point $x \in U \cap D$, we have $f(x) \in V$.

###### Definition
**(English)**

$L$ is a __limit__ of $f$ approaching $c$ (assumed to be an accumulation point of the domain $D$) if, for each [[neighbourhood]] $V$ of $L$, for some [[punctured neighborhood|punctured neighbourhood]] $U$ of $c$, for each point $x \in U \cap D$, we have $f(x) \in V$.  Equivalently, for each neighbourhood $V$ of $L$, for some neighbourhood $U'$ of $c$, for each point $x \in U' \cap D$, if $x \ne c$, then $f(x) \in V$.
=--

Note that in each case, $U \cap \dom f$ is [[inhabited subset|inhabited]] precisely because $c$ is a limit point of $D$.  That is, in the French definition, $U \cap D$ must be inhabited because an adherent point of $D$ is precisely a point $c$ such that each neighbourhood of $c$ meets $D$; while in the English definition, $U \cap D$ must be inhabited because an accumulation point of $D$ is precisely a point $c$ such that each punctured neighbourhood of $c$ meets $D$.  If we did not require $c$ to be such a limit point (in other words, if we allowed $c$ to have a [punctured] neighbourhood $U$ that was disjoint from $D$), then every value $L$ would satisfy the definition vacuously.

The two notions of limit can each be defined in terms of the other:
+-- {: .num_prop #translation}
###### Proposition

$L$ is a limit of $f$ approaching $c$ by the English definition if and only if $L$ is a limit of $f|_{\hat{c}}$ approaching $c$ by the French definition, where $f|_{\hat{c}}$ is the [[restriction]] of $f$ to the [[relative complement]] $D \setminus \{c\}$ of $c$ in the original domain $D$.  Conversely, $L$ is a limit of $f$ approaching $c$ by the French definition if and only if $c$ is an adherent point of the domain $D$ and these two hypothetical conditions are met: if $f$ is defined at $c$ (in other words, if $c$ belongs to $D$), then $f(c)$ belongs to every neighbourhood of $L$; and if $c$ is an accumulation point of $D$, then $L$ is a limit of $f$ approaching $c$ by the English definition.
=--

The basic difference is that the English definition doesn\'t care about $f(c)$ itself, while the French definition does.  For the French, $f$ must be continuous at $c$ if it is defined there, or equivalently (in the Hausdorff case), $f(c)$ must equal the limit $L$ if it exists at all.  This makes the French definition more strict when both make sense, but it also allows the French definition to make sense at isolated points of the domain $D$, since we know what the value must be there.  For $c \notin D$, then the two definitions are equivalent.

These limits can be defined as [[limits of a filter]]:
+-- {: .num_prop #filter}
###### Proposition

Let $\mathcal{N}_c$ be the [[neighbourhood filter]] of $c$, and let $\dot{\mathcal{N}}_c$ be the filter of punctured neighbourhoods of $c$.  Then the filter $f(\mathcal{N}_c)$ is [[proper filter|proper]] iff $c$ is an adherent point of $\dom f$, and $f(\dot{\mathcal{N}}_c)$ is proper iff $c$ is an accumulation point of $\dom f$.  Futhermore, $L$ is a limit of $f$ approaching $c$ by the French definition iff $L$ is a limit of $f_*(\mathcal{N}_c)$, and $L$ is a limit of $f$ approaching $c$ by the English definition iff $L$ is a limit of $f_*(\dot{\mathcal{N}}_c)$.
=--

Here, $f_*(\mathcal{F})$ is the filter generated by the [[filterbase]] of sets $f_*(A)$ for $A \in \mathcal{F}$, where $f_*(A)$ is the image $\{ f(x) \;|\; x \in A \}$.  As an immediate corollary, if $Y$ is [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]], then $L$ must be the *only* limit of $f$ approaching $c$.

We can generalize from functions to [[multivalued functions]]; since we\'re already using partial functions, this means that we are dealing with an arbitrary [[binary relation]].  That is, let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces, let $R$ be a relation from $X$ to $Y$, let $c$ be a limit (adherent or accumulation) point of the domain $D$ of $R$ in $X$, and let $L$ be a point in $Y$.

+-- {: .num_defn #relations}
###### Definition

$L$ is a __limit__ of $R$ approaching $c$ if, for each neighbourhood $V$ of $L$, for some [punctured] neighbourhood $U$ of $c$, for each point $x \in U \cap D$, we have $R[x] \subseteq V$.
=--

Here, $R[x]$ is the set $\{ y \in Y \;|\; (x,y) \in R \}$ of values of $R$ at $x$.  Again, there are both French-style and English-style versions of the definition.  This can also be defined as the limit of a filter $R_*[\mathcal{N}_c]$ or $R_*[\dot{\mathcal{N}}_c]$, where $R_*[\mathcal{F}]$ is generated by the sets $R_*(A) = \bigcup_{x \in A} R[x]$ for $A \in \mathcal{F}$.  In particular, limits of multivalued functions are still unique, so long as the [[target]] $Y$ is Hausdorff.

We may generalize further from relations to [[spans]].  Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces, let $\Gamma$ be any [[set]], let $g\colon \Gamma \to X$ and $f\colon \Gamma \to Y$ be any functions, let $c$ be a limit (adherent or accumulation) point of the [[range]] $D$ of $g$ in $X$, and let $L$ be a point in $Y$.

+-- {: .num_defn #spans}
###### Definition

$L$ is a __limit__ of the span $(g,f)$ approaching $c$ if, for each neighbourhood $V$ of $L$, for some [punctured] neighbourhood $U$ of $c$, for each element $\gamma$ of the [[preimage]] $g^*(U \cap D)$, we have $f(\gamma) \in V$.
=--

Once again, there are both French-style and English-style versions of the definition.  And this too be defined as the limit of a filter $f_*(g^*(\mathcal{N}_c))$ or $f_*(g^*(\dot{\mathcal{N}}_c))$, where $g^*(\mathcal{F})$ consists of the [[preimages]] $g^*(A)$ for $A \in \mathcal{F}$.  In particular, limits of spans to a Hausdorff space are unique.

Limits of spans are no more general than limits of relations:
+-- {: .num_prop #spansrelations}
###### Proposition

$L$ is a limit of the span $(g,f)$ approaching $c$ if and only if $L$ is a limit of the [[range]] $\ran(g,f) = \{ g(\gamma), f(\gamma) \;|\; \gamma \in \Gamma \}$ approaching $c$.
=--
(But often the span is more convenient to refer to than its range.)

Finally, we may impose restrictions on the limit:
+-- {: .num_defn #restricted}
###### Definition

Let $C$ be a [[subset]] of $X$, and suppose that $c$ is a limit (adherent or accumulation) point of $C$.  Then $L$ is a __limit__ of the function $f$ (or the relation $R$, or the span $(g,f)$) approaching $c$ in $C$ if $L$ is a limit of the [[restriction]] $f|_C$ of $f$ to $D \cap C$ (or the restriction $R \cap (C \times Y)$ of $R$, or the restriction $(g|_{g^*(C)},f|_{g^*(C)})$ of $(g,f)$).  In the case of the limit of a span, we can also let $C$ be a subset of $\Gamma$; then the limit in question is the limit of $(g|_C,f|_C)$.
=--

Yet again, there are both French-style and English-style versions, although these are equivalent when $c \notin C$.  And once more, this is the limit of a filter, since it reduces to a previous definition.

This concept allows us to define the English version of limit directly as a French limit:
+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

$L$ is a limit (in the English sense) of $f$ (or $R$, or $(g,f)$) approaching $c$ in $C$ if and only if $L$ is a limit (in the French sense) of $f$ (or $R$, or $(g,f)$) approaching $c$ in $C \setminus c$.
=--

To go more general than this would seem to require referring directly to a [[net]] $\nu$ or [[filter]] $\mathcal{F}$ on $X$, at which point we may as well just talk about the [[limit of the net]] $f \circ \nu$ or the [[limit of the filter]] $f_*(\mathcal{F})$ (or of the filter $R_*[\mathcal{F}]$ or of the filter $f_*(g^*(\mathcal{F}))$).


## Notation

In the Hausdorff case, we usually write
$$ L = \lim_{x \to c} f(x) $$
to say that $L$ is a limit, or rather *the* limit, of $f$ approaching $c$.  Or indeed, just write
$$ \lim_{x \to c} f(x) $$
for the limit, if it exists (so, like $1/x$ when $x$ is an arbitrary real number, this is a symbol for a thing that might not be defined).  Since $x$ is just a dummy variable here, one can try a notation that does not refer to it, such as $ \lim_c f$ or $f(c^\pm)$.

The last notation is not very common, but some variations of it are when $X$ is a topological [[poset]]: $f(c^-)$ is the limit of $f$ approaching $c$ in $C = \{ x \in X \;|\; x \lt c \}$, while $f(c^+)$ is the limit of $f$ approaching $c$ in $C = \{ x \in X \;|\; x \gt c \}$.  Similarly, $f(\infty)$ is the limit of $f$ approaching $\infty$, where the domain $X$ is taken to be the [[disjoint union]] (as a set) of the original topological poset and a point $\infty$ that is greater than every original element and whose neighbourhoods are the [[upper sets]] of $X$; while $f(-\infty)$ is the limit of $f$ approaching $-\infty$, where the domain $X$ is taken to be the disjoint union of the original topological poset and a point $-\infty$ that is less than every original element and whose neighbourhoods are the [[lower sets]] of $X$.  (In all of these, the French and English definitions agree.)

For the general restricted case, write
$$ \lim_{x \to c \atop c \in C} f(x) $$
for the limit of $f$ approaching $c$ in $C$.  (So for example, $f(c^+)$ is $\lim_{x \to c \atop x \gt c} f(x)$.)  The dummy variable is quite useful here, since neither $f$ nor $C$ have to be given names but can be given by formulas instead.

In the non-Hausdorff case, we can use the same notation but interpret it as referring to a [[subset]] of $Y$ instead of an element of $Y$.  Then this subset always exists; it just might be [[empty subset|empty]].  Sometimes a capitalized $Lim$ is used to emphasize that this is now a set.  This set could also be taken to be all of $Y$ whenever $c$ is not a limit point of the appropriate kind, but this is likely to lead to confusion if not explicitly warned about.

Another notation, especially useful when $Y$ is non-Hausdorff, but common even in the Hausdorff case, is
$$ f(x) \underset{x \to c}{\to} L $$
to mean that $L$ is a limit of $f$ approaching $c$.  Again, we can add $c \in C$ if we wish to take the limit in $C$.  And again, the dummy variable means that we don\'t need a name for $f$ (or $C$), just a formula.  Often one writes only $f(x) \to L$ and puts $x \to c$ (and $c \in C$ if appropriate) off to the side somewhere:
* $f(x) \to L$ as $x \to c$ while $c \in C$,
or in words: $f(x)$ approaches $L$ as $x$ approaches $c$ while $c \in C$.

Most of this notation can also be used for limits of spans:
$$ \array { L = \lim_{g(\gamma) \to c \atop \gamma \in C} f(\gamma) ,\\
L \in \underset{g(\gamma) \to c \atop \gamma \in C}{Lim} f(\gamma) ,\\
f(\gamma) \underset{g(\gamma) \to c \atop \gamma \in C}{\to} L } $$
all mean that $L$ is a limit of $(g,f)$ approaching $c$ in $C$.  Thus the most general notion of limit appearing here is to say that $f(\gamma)$ approaches $L$ as $g(\gamma)$ approaches $c$ while $\gamma \in C$.

It would be nice to have notation to distinguish the French and English versions of limit.  One way would be to adopt the French definition by default and add the restriction $x \ne c$ to produce the English version.  Unfortunately, the English definition is the default in most of the world, and then there is no slick way to denote the French version.


## Examples

A function $f$ is [[continuous function|continuous]] at a point $c$ in its domain $D$, if and only if $f(c)$ is a limit of $f$ approaching $c$ by the French definition; $f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if, if $c$ is an accumulation point of $D$, then $f(c)$ is a limit of $f$ approaching $c$.  (If $c$ is an [[isolated point]] of $D$, then of course $f$ is continuous there.)

Given a [[real number|real]]-valued function $F$ defined on a real [[interval]] $[a,b]$, we can speak of tagged partitions of $[a,b]$ and consider the [[Riemann sum|Riemann sums]] of $F$ on these tagged partitions.  Let $X$ and $Y$ each be the [[real line]], let $\Gamma$ be the set of tagged partitions of $[a,b]$, let $g\colon \Gamma \to X$ map a partition to the maximum length of its parts (often called the norm or mesh of the partition), and let $f\colon \Gamma \to Y$ map a tagged partition to the Riemann sum of $F$ on it.  Then the [[Riemann integral]] of $F$ on $[a,b]$ is defined to be the limit of the span $(f,g)$ approaching $0$.  That is, the Riemann integral of a function on an interval is the limit of the Riemann sum of the function on a tagged partition of the interval as the mesh of the partition approaches zero.

Let $A$ be a [[directed set]] and let $\nu\colon A \to Y$ be a [[net]] in $Y$.  Give $A$ the [[discrete topology]], and let $X$ be the [[disjoint union]] (as a set) of $A$ and $\{\infty\}$, made into a [[proset]] with $x \lt \infty$ for $x \in A$, and made into a topological space with the neighbourhoods of $\infty$ being the [[upper sets]] of $X$.  Interpret $\nu$ as a partial function from $X$ to $Y$.  Then the limits of $\nu$ approaching $\infty$ are precisely the [[limit of a net|limits]] of $\nu$ as a net.


## Properties

Using the French definition, the limit of a [[composite]] function $f \circ g$ approaching $c$ is equal to the limit of $f$ approaching the limit of $g$ approaching $c$, if the latter exists:
$$ \lim_c (f \circ g) \risingdotseq \lim_{\lim_c g} f ,$$
or equivalently $(f \circ g)(c^\pm) \risingdotseq f(g(c^\pm)^\pm)$, where $\risingdotseq$ means equal if the right-hand side is defined.  Using the English definition, this holds if we impose the requirement that if $g$ takes the value $\lim_c g$ arbitrarily close to $c$ and $f$ is defined there, then $f$ is continuous there.  Either way, we can write
$$ \lim_{x \to c} f(g(x)) = f\Big(\lim_{x \to c} g(x)\Big) $$
if $f$ is continuous at $\lim_c g$.
