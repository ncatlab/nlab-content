## Idea

The linear dual vector space of a finite-dimensional [[Lie algebra]] has a natural [[Poisson structure]] of Kirillov-Kostant-Souriau which is called the __linear Poisson structure__. Its symplectic leaves are precisely the [[coadjoint orbits]]. The geometric quantization of linear Poisson structures is important in the representation theory; the corresponding star products are important basic examples in the study of [[deformation quantization]] (e.g. [Gutt 11, section 2.2](#Gutt11)).
