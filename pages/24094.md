The term “h-cofibration” can refer to two closely related, but different notions:

* [[Hurewicz cofibrations]];

* the dual notion to [[sharp maps]].

In this article, we concentrate on the latter.

## Definition

A map $f\colon X\to Y$ in a [[relative category]] $C$ is an __h-cofibration__
if the [[cobase change]] functor $X/C\to Y/C$ is a [[relative functor]], i.e., preserves weak equivalences.

## Properties

A [[model category]] is [[left proper]] if and only if all cofibrations are h-cofibrations.

In a [[left proper]] [[model category]], [[cobase changes]] along h-cofibrations are [[homotopy cobase changes]].

The notion of h-cofibrations is most useful in the left proper case,
and one can argue that in the non-left proper case, the above property
should be taken as the definition instead.

## Related concepts

* The dual notion is known as a “[[sharp map]]” or “h-fibration”.
