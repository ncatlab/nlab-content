## Idea

A system in [[formal logic]] is called _inconsistent_ if it admits a [[proof]] of a _[[contradiction]]_ (that is, usually, a proof of [[false]], or an inhabitant of the [[empty type]]).

Accordingly an [[axiom]] is called _inconsistent_ or to _lead to an inconsistency_ if adding it to an (implicitly understood) ambient logical system makes that system inconsistent.

In most usual logical systems, it follows that an inconsistent system admits a proof of *every* proposition, by the rule *ex falso quodlibet* (which is just the elimination rule for the [[empty type]]).  For this reason, sometimes (especially in [[type theory]]), the adjective "inconsistent" is used to mean a system with this property instead.  If we want to distinguish, then a system which admits a proof of every proposition may be called *trivial*.  Of course, a trivial system is inconsistent, but a [[paraconsistent logic]] can be inconsistent without being trivial.
