## Idea

A system in [[formal logic]] is called _inconsistent_ if it admits a [[proof]] of [[false]]: a _[[contradiction]]_.

Accordingly an [[axiom]] is called _inconsistent_ or to _lead to an inconsistency_ if adding it to an (implicitly understood) ambient logical system makes that system inconsistent.
