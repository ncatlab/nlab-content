## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

Given a [[deformation context]] $(\mathcal{Y}, \{E_\alpha\}_\alpha)$, the [[(∞,1)-category]] of **formal moduli problems** over it is the full [[sub-(∞,1)-category]] of the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-presheaves]] over $\mathcal{Y}^{inf}$

$$
  Moduli^\mathcal{Y}
  \hookrightarrow
  [\mathcal{Y}^{inf}, \infty Grpd]
$$

on those [[(∞,1)-functors]] $X \colon \mathcal{Y}^{inf} \to \infty Grpd$ such that

1. over the [[terminal object]] they are [[contractible]]: $X(*) \simeq *$ (hence they are [[anti-reduced object|anti-reduced]]);

1. they preserve [[(∞,1)-pullbacks]] (are [[cohesive ∞-presheaf on E-∞ rings|infinitesimally cohesive]])

###### Remark

This means that a "formal deformation problem" is a [[space]] in [[higher geometry]] whose geometric structure is detected by the "test spaces" in $\mathcal{Y}^{op}$ in a way that respects gluing ([[descent]]) in $\mathcal{Y}^{op}$ as given by [[(∞,1)-pullbacks]] there. The first condition requires that there is an essentially unique such probe by the point, hence that these higher geometric space has essentially a single global point. This is the condition that reflects the infinitesimal nature of the deformation problem.

## Properties

### Relation to $L_\infty$-algebras

For $k$ a [[field]] of [[characteristic]] 0, write
write $CAlg_k^{sm} \hookrightarrow CAlg_k$ for the [[(∞,1)-category]] of [[Artin ring|Artinian]] [[E-∞ algebras]] over $k$, or equivalently that of commutative [[dg-algebras]] over $k$.


+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

There is an [[equivalence of (∞,1)-categories]]

$$
  L_\infty Alg_k \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} Moduli^{CAlg^{sm}_k}
$$

with that of [[L-∞ algebras]].

In this form this is ([Lurie, theore 0.0.13](#Lurie)).
See at _[[model structure for L-∞ algebras]]_ for various other incarnations of this equivalence.



### Relation to Lie differentiation

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

Given a [[deformation context]] $\mathcal{Y}$, the restricted [[(∞,1)-Yoneda embedding]] gives an [[(∞,1)-functor]]

$$
  Lie \colon \mathcal{Y} \to Moduli^{\mathcal{Y}}
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

For $Y \in \mathcal{Y}^{op}$, the object $Lie(Y)$ represents the _[[formal geometry|formal neighbourhood]]_ of the basepoint of $Y$ as seen by the infinitesimally thickened points dual to the $\{E_\alpha\}$.

Hence we may call this the operaton of **[[Lie differentiation]]** of spaces in $\mathcal{Y}^{op}$ around their given base point.
