## Idea

In the context of [[quantum field theory]], _Liouville theory_ is the name of a certain type of [[2d CFT]].

## Properties

### Relation to 3d quantum gravity

An argument (via [[Chern-Simons gravity]], but see the caveats there) that [[3d quantum gravity]] with negative [[cosmological constant]] has as [[boundary field theory]] 2d [[Liouville theory]] is due to ([Coussaert-Henneaux-vanDriel 95](#CoussaertHenneauxvanDriel95)). See also at _[[AdS3-CFT2 and CS-WZW correspondence]]_.

  **Abstract**: We rigorously define the Liouville action functional for finitely generated, purely loxodromic quasi-Fuchsian group using homology and cohomology double complexes naturally associated with the group action. We prove that the classical action - the critical point of the Liouville action functional, considered as a function on the quasi-Fuchsian deformation space, is an antiderivative of a 1-form given by the difference of Fuchsian and quasi-Fuchsian projective connections. This result can be considered as global quasi-Fuchsian reciprocity which implies McMullen's quasi-Fuchsian reciprocity. We prove that the classical action is a Kahler potential of the Weil-Petersson metric. We also prove that Liouville action functional satisfies holography principle, i.e., it is a regularized limit of the hyperbolic volume of a 3-manifold associated with a quasi-Fuchsian group. We generalize these results to a large class of Kleinian groups including finitely generated, purely loxodromic Schottky and quasi-Fuchsian groups and their free combinations.
