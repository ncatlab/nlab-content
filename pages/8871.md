__Braided geometry__ is a flavour of [[noncommutative geometry]] in which the commutativity is relaxed to some sort of braiding. 

Most obvious kind of braided geometry is to do geometry within a [[braided monoidal category]]. This has been developed by [[Vladimir Drinfel'd]] and then much further by [[Shahn Majid]]. 

This approach has some problems, for example, if the R-matrix is a deformation of the standard flip, then various objects in the category have their graded dimensions different from the classical case, i.e. "the deformation is not flat". If one replaces the FRT quantized function algebra by [[reflection equation algebra]] then, for Hecke R-matrix, the deformation
is flat.
