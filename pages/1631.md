## Idea

There is a [[cofibrantly generated model category|cofibrantly generated]] ("[[folk model structure|folk]]") [[model category|model structure]] on the category of [[strict ∞-groupoid]]s, equivalently that of [[crossed complex]]es.

It is the [[transferred model structure]] along the [[forgetful functor]] of the [[model structure on strict ω-categories]].
