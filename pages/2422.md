##Idea ##

This page is a spin-off of the [[structural set theory]] described at [[SEAR]]. The aim is to define (individual) natural numbers in SEAR without assuming the axiom of infinity. As a result, there should be a set with $n$ elements for all $n$, but we will not have a set of all natural numbers.

The aim is to use as few axioms as possible

## Zero and One ##

Barring opinions whether zero should be a natural number, in SEAR we have sets $\empty$ and $\mathbf{1}$ with zero and one element respectively. These follow from axioms 0, 1 and 2.

## Two ##

A candidate for $\mathbf{2}$ is clearly $P\mathbf{1}$, but we need to show it has two elements. Also, it would be nice to not have to use the power object.

## Three and many ##

From here we proceed inductively...

[[David Roberts]]: This may be overkill, as maybe $\mathbf{n}$ could be $\mathbf{1}\coprod \ldots \coprod \mathbf{1}$ ($n$ times), but I was thinking of mimicking other better-known definitions
