## Idea 

An accessible [[category]] is a possibly [[large category]] which is however essentially determined by a [[small category]] in that it behaves like the category of [[ind-object]]s of a small category.

Accessible categories are the categories of models of [[sketch|sketches]].

## Definition 

A [[locally small category]] is accessible if for some [[regular cardinal]] $\kappa$:

* the category has $\kappa$-[[directed colimit]]s,
* there is a set of $\kappa$-[[compact object]]s that generate the category under $\kappa$-directed colimits.

## Relation to other concepts ##

If an accessible category in addition has all (small) [[colimit]]s (or, equivalently, [[limits]]), then it is a [[locally presentable category]].

###### Proposition (preservation of accessibility under inverse images)

Let $F : C \to D$ be a [[functor]] between [[presentable category|presentable categories]] which preserves $\kappa$-[[filtered category|filtered]] [[colimit]], and let $D_0 \subset D$ be an accessible subcategory. Then the inverse image $f^{-1}(D_0) \subset C$ is a $\kappa$-accessible subcategory.

###### Proposition (accessibility of fibrations and weak equivalences in a combinatorial model category)

Let $C$ be a [[combinatorial model category]], $Arr(C)$ its [[arrow category]], $W \subset Arr(C)$ the [[full subcategory]] on the weak equivalences and $F \subset Arr(C)$ the full subcategory on the fibrations. Then $F$, $W$ and $F \cap W$ are accessible subcategories of $Arr(C)$
