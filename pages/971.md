## Idea ##

An accessible [[category]] is a possibly [[large category]] which is however essentially determined by a [[small category]] in that it behaves like the category of [[ind-object]]s of a small category.

Accessible categories are the categories of models of [[sketch|sketches]].

## Definition ##

A [[locally small category]] is accessible if for some [[regular cardinal]] $\kappa$:

* the category has $\kappa$-[[directed colimit]]s,
* there is a set of $\kappa$-[[compact object]]s that generate the category under $\kappa$-directed colimits.

## Relation to other concepts ##

If an accessible category in addition has all (small) [[colimit]]s (or, equivalently, [[limits]]), then it is a [[locally presentable category]].
