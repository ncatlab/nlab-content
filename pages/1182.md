This entry is about the work by David Ben-Zvi, John Francis and David Nadler on application of a [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categorical]] realization of [[geometric function theory]] to [[FQFT|extended quantum field theory]] in the context in which Jacob Lurie proved the [[generalized tangle hypothesis|cobordism hypothesis]].

So far this work is presented in the two articles

This entry is supposed to be the $n$Lab-working area for a " Journal Club -- Geometric $\infty$-function theory ". The corresponding discussion page at the $n$-Caf&eacute; is [Journal Club -- Geometric Infinity-Function Theory](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/04/journal_club_geometric_infinit.html)

The idea is to 

* jointly discuss at the $n$Caf&eacute; section-by-section these articles; to get an idea for what's going on;

* add here, step by step, links to keywords appearing in these sections, and create the corresponding entries describing them.

* This is supposed to be a recursive and iterative process, which, if successful, will eventually create here a useful repository of entries that describe and explain the various aspects of the topic.

#Idea#

The central structural theorem of [[FQFT|TQFT]], the [[generalized tangle hypothesis|cobordism theorem]] states that [[FQFT|(infinity,n)-categorical extended topological quantum field theories]] are entirely determined by their value in the [[point]], which has to be an [[object]] in an [[(infinity,n)-category]] with high dualizability properties.

Very generally, the point of _geometric $\infty$-function theory_ is to construct and study concrete realizations of the [[FQFT]]s guaranteed to exist by this theorem.

The central tool, from which this entry draws its title, is an [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categorical]] version of [[geometric function theory]]: 

the rough idea is that the data the [[FQFT]] assigns to a manifold $\Sigma$ is a collection $Z(\Sigma)$ of $\infty$-functions -- the physical _fields_ -- on $\Sigma$, or, more generally, sections of some $\infty$-bundle on $\Sigma$, and that the morphism $Z(\Sigma) : Z(\Sigma_{in}) \to Z(\Sigma_{out})$ assigned by the [[FQFT]] to a [[cobordism]] $\Sigma : \Sigma_{in} \to \Sigma_{out}$
is obtained from a [[groupoidification|pull-push-operation]] on the objects of $Z(\Sigma_{in})$ through a [[span]] to obtain objects in $Z(\Sigma_{out})$.

This picture arises  naturally and is maybe best understood in terms of [[FQFT]]s that arise as [[sigma-model]]s, namely which are [[representable functor|represented]] by a _target space_ object $P$:

assume that $P$ is some kind of generalized space (which will usually mean: an [[(infinity,1)-sheaf]], see [[heuristic introduction to sheaves, cohomology and higher stacks]] for motivation of this point) and regard the manifolds $\Sigma$ as special cases of generalized manifolds.

Writing $[- , P]$ for the [[closed monoidal category|internal hom]] in the given context, every [[cobordism]] [[cospan]] is sent to a [[span]]

$$
  [-, P]
  : 
  \left(
  \array{
    && \Sigma
    \\
    & \nearrow && \nwarrow
    \\
    \Sigma_{in} &&&& \Sigma_{out}
  }
  \right)
  \mapsto
  \left(
  \array{
    && [\Sigma, P]
    \\
    & {}^{p_1}\swarrow && \searrow^{p_2}
    \\
    [\Sigma_{in}, P] &&&& [\Sigma_{out}, P]
  }
  \right)  
  \,.
$$

If now $C([\Sigma_{in},P])$ denotes some sensible collection of $\infty$-functions on the mapping space $[\Sigma_{in}, P]$, there will be an [[(infinity,1)-category|infinity-categorical]] pull-push operation

$$
  \int_{p_2} p_1^*(-) : C([\Sigma_{in}, P]) \to C([\Sigma_{out}, P])
$$

generalizing the analogous operation as described as [[groupoidification]].

As described as [[geometric function theory]], such pull-push operations can naturally be regarded as vast generalization of familiar [[matrix calculus]], including in particular operations like Fourier-Moukai transformations.


## Summary ##

In __IntTrans__ the basic machinery of these $\infty$-categorical pull-push operations is established.

In _CharTheo_ the particular case of an [[FQFT]] is considered whose defining assigment to the [[point]] is the differential graded Hecke category

$$
  H_G = D( B  \backslash (G/B))
$$ 

of $B$-equivariant D-modules on the flag variety $G/B$ of a complex reductive group $G$ with Borel subgroup $B$.
