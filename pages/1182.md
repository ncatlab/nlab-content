The corresponding discussion page at the $n$-Caf&eacute; is [Journal Club -- Geometric Infinity-Function Theory](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/04/journal_club_geometric_infinit.html)

The idea is to

* add here, step by step, links to keywords appearing in these sections, and create the corresponding entries describing them.

* This is supposed to be a recursive and iterative process, which, if successful, will eventually create here a useful repository of entries that describe and explain the various aspects of the topic.

# Timeline #

We will try to proceed as follows: we go through the sections of the two articles, step by step, possibly several steps for one section. Each week on Monday, one of us produces a "report" on the section he or she was assigned to read. 

This "report" would try to give a rough idea of what is going on in a given section. A report may be anything from a  heap of questions (likely) to a complete detailed rederivation of all the details (maybe not quite as likely, but let's not exclude it!) The more questions, the more we all get involved, which is the whole point of doing this online.

I ([[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]) am imagining that whatever the report is like, it consists of 

* a bulleted list of whatever needs to be listed, with links to whatever deserves to be linked to, here in this $n$Lab-entry, in the following list of sections;

* a comment to the [blog entry](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/04/journal_club_geometric_infinit.html) that maybe copies this entire content but at least alerts the blog readers about the new material now to be found here, accompanied by some comments as seems necessary.

The idea is that we have discussion on the blog but distill whatever we can into the $n$Lab here.


Here is the list of reports, as planned so far:

#Idea#

The central structural theorem of [[FQFT|TQFT]], the [[generalized tangle hypothesis|cobordism theorem]] states that [[FQFT|(infinity,n)-categorical extended topological quantum field theories]] are entirely determined by their value in the [[point]], which has to be an [[object]] in an [[(infinity,n)-category]] with high dualizability properties.

Very generally, the point of _geometric $\infty$-function theory_ is to construct and study concrete realizations of the [[FQFT]]s guaranteed to exist by this theorem.

The central tool, from which this entry draws its title, is an [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categorical]] version of [[geometric function theory]]: 

the rough idea is that the data the [[FQFT]] assigns to a manifold $\Sigma$ is a collection $Z(\Sigma)$ of $\infty$-functions -- the physical _fields_ -- on $\Sigma$, or, more generally, sections of some $\infty$-bundle on $\Sigma$, and that the morphism $Z(\Sigma) : Z(\Sigma_{in}) \to Z(\Sigma_{out})$ assigned by the [[FQFT]] to a [[cobordism]] $\Sigma : \Sigma_{in} \to \Sigma_{out}$
is obtained from a [[groupoidification|pull-push-operation]] on the objects of $Z(\Sigma_{in})$ through a [[span]] to obtain objects in $Z(\Sigma_{out})$.

This picture arises  naturally and is maybe best understood in terms of [[FQFT]]s that arise as [[sigma-model]]s, namely which are [[representable functor|represented]] by a _target space_ object $P$:

assume that $P$ is some kind of generalized space (which will usually mean: an [[(infinity,1)-sheaf]], see [[heuristic introduction to sheaves, cohomology and higher stacks]] for motivation of this point) and regard the manifolds $\Sigma$ as special cases of generalized manifolds.

Writing $[- , P]$ for the [[closed monoidal category|internal hom]] in the given context, every [[cobordism]] [[cospan]] is sent to a [[span]]

$$
  [-, P]
  : 
  \left(
  \array{
    && \Sigma
    \\
    & \nearrow && \nwarrow
    \\
    \Sigma_{in} &&&& \Sigma_{out}
  }
  \right)
  \mapsto
  \left(
  \array{
    && [\Sigma, P]
    \\
    & {}^{p_1}\swarrow && \searrow^{p_2}
    \\
    [\Sigma_{in}, P] &&&& [\Sigma_{out}, P]
  }
  \right)  
  \,.
$$

If now $C([\Sigma_{in},P])$ denotes some sensible collection of $\infty$-functions on the mapping space $[\Sigma_{in}, P]$, there will be an [[(infinity,1)-category|infinity-categorical]] pull-push operation

$$
  \int_{p_2} p_1^*(-) : C([\Sigma_{in}, P]) \to C([\Sigma_{out}, P])
$$

generalizing the analogous operation as described as [[groupoidification]].

As described as [[geometric function theory]], such pull-push operations can naturally be regarded as vast generalization of familiar [[matrix calculus]], including in particular operations like Fourier-Moukai transformations.


## Summary ##

In __IntTrans__ the basic machinery of these $\infty$-categorical pull-push operations is established.

In _CharTheo_ the particular case of an [[FQFT]] is considered whose defining assigment to the [[point]] is the differential graded Hecke category

$$
  H_G = D( B  \backslash (G/B))
$$ 

of $B$-equivariant D-modules on the flag variety $G/B$ of a complex reductive group $G$ with Borel subgroup $B$.

### 2. Preliminaries ###

Recall that the goal of **geometric $\infty$-function theory** is

* to establish a good [[higher category theory|higher categorical]] version of linear algebra ("integral transform" = "higher matrix multiplication"!)

* such that interesting classes of [[sigma-model]] [[FQFT|extended TQFTs]] $Z_P$ are [[representable functor|represented]] by [[heuristic introduction to sheaves, cohomology and higher stacks|generalized spaces]] $P$ 

  * in that the "higher linear map" $Z_P(\Sigma)$ assigned by the [[FQFT|QFT]] to a [[cobordism]] [[cospan]] $\array{ && \Sigma \\ & \nearrow && \nwarrow \\ \Sigma_{in} &&&& \Sigma_{out}}$ is given by the [[span]] $\array{ && [\Sigma,P] \\ & \swarrow && \searrow \\ [\Sigma_{in},P] &&&& [\Sigma_{out}, P]}$.

This clearly requires that

* we fix a good ambient context of [[Higher Topos Theory|higher sheaf- and category theory]];

* and inside that a good general concept of [[higher algebra]].

One point made by the [[David Ben-Zvi|Ben-Zvi]]/Francis/Nadler work is that a good working context of [[higher category theory]] in which a good notion of _geometric $\infty$-function theory_ can be set up nicely is the context assembled and developed in the PhD thesis of [[Jacob Lurie]], consisting of

* [[Higher Topos Theory]] -- the theory of [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categories]] and [[(infinity,1)-sheaf|(infinity,1)-sheaves]]

  * this assembles and develops 

    * work by [[Andre Joyal]] on [[quasi-category|quasi-categories]];

    * work by Simpson, Rezk, To&euml;n, Vezzosi and others on [[higher category theory|higher categories]] and [[infinity-stack|higher stacks]];

    * work by [[BrownAHT|Brown]], [[Andre Joyal|Joyal]], Jardine and others on [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|models]] for [[infinity-stack]]s in terms of a [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]].

* [[Stable Infinity-Categories|Stable Higher Category Theory]] -- essentially the theory of [[additive and abelian categories]] lifted to the $(\infty,1)$-context;

  * which puts the large body of work on [[homotopy theory|stable homotopy theory]] and [[homological algebra]] into the above [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categorical]] context, in essence identifying the abstract idea modeled by [[pretriangulated dg-category|pretriangulated dg-categories]] and [[A-infinity category|A-infinity categories]]

* [[higher algebra|Higher Algebra]] -- the theory of [[monoid]]- or [[algebra]]-objects [[internalization|internal to]] ([[symmetric monoidal (infinity,1)-category|symmetric]]) [[monoidal (infinity,1)-category|monoidal]] [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categories]]

  * expanding on work by To&euml;n-Vezzosi;

  * wich puts into its natural higher categorical context

    * the "brave new algebra" of [[commutative ring spectrum|ring spectra]];

    * the notions of things like [[A-infinity ring]]s and [[symmetric monoidal category|E-infinity category]].

Especially for the newcomer and non-expert it must be understood that the plethora of high-powered terminology appearing here is conceptually _simplified_ and unified by their description in the higher categorical context -- so you _gain_ by trying to learn this stuff here first before going into the standard literature:

* the concept of an [[(infinity,1)-sheaf]]/[[infinity-stack]] is _much simpler_ than its model in terms of the [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]];

* the concept of a [[stable (infinity,1)-category]] is _much simpler_ than its 1-categorical shadow as a [[triangulated category]];

* the concept of a [[commutative algebra in an (infinity,1)-category]] is _simpler_ than the details of its realization given by a [[commutative ring spectrum]].

* Moreover, the gain of _geometric $\infty$-function theory_ will be that it turns out to _unify_ a wealth of concepts appearing in [[FQFT]] and [[representation theory]].

This is the reason why we bother with geometric $\infty$-function theory and devote a detailed discussion to it: _geometric $\infty$-function theory_ carries the promise of getting close to the sought-for Lawvere-ification of quantum field theory -- providing its [[physics|natural language]].



#### 2.1 $\infty$-categories ####

The [[infinity-category|infinity-categories]] that we are dealing with here are 

* [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categories]].

There are several reasons for 

* [[why (infinity,1)-categories?]]

in the present context, the main one being that they allow to make precise the ideas summarized in the

* [[heuristic introduction to sheaves, cohomology and higher stacks]].


In principle one will want to eventually understand [[geometric function theory]] in the context of more general [[higher category theory]], in particular for [[(infinity,n)-category|(infinity,n)-categories]], but a great deal is already gained by just (hah!) looking at [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categories]] -- not the least because (only) for them a working well-developed full theory exists at the moment, developed by [[Andre Joyal]] and further developed by [[Jacob Lurie]]:

* [[Higher Topos Theory]]

This subsumes and unifies notably a wealth of more-or-less ad-hoc constructions that have been known for a bit longer. In particular the theory of [[model category|model categories]] is realized as a way to, well, model $(\infty,1)$-categories:

In particular every

* [[simplicial model category]]

is naturally a 

* [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presentation of an (infinity,1)-category]].

##### 2.1.1 Enhancing triangulated categories #####

The aim of _geometric $\infty$-function theory_ is to develop a good $\infty$-categorical generalization of the simple notion of 

* _sets of functions on spaces_ 

to 

* "$\infty$-categories of $\infty$-functions" on "$(\infty)$-spaces" 

essentially following the general philosophy of [[space and quantity]].

Whatever the answer is, the collection of such $\infty$-functions should be

* abelian

and

* monoidal

in a suitable sense. 

From various examples it has become clear that the right [[vertical categorification]] of a function $X \to \mathbb{C}$ is a [[functor]] $X \to Vect_{\mathbb{C}}$, which -- if sufficiently well behaved -- we may regard as a vector bundle on $X$.

Indeed, just as functions $[X,\mathbb{C}]$ form a vector space, functors $[X, Vect_{\mathbb{C}}]$ naturally form a [[2-vector space]].

Such a 2-vector space is in particular an [[abelian category]]. This is one of the ways in which we expect $\infty$-functions to form an _abelian_ collection. 

Experience shows that the right (or at least a very good) $\infty$-[[vertical categorification]] of [[abelian category]] is a

* [[stable (infinity,1)-category]].
  
It turns out that just as [[model category|model categories]] and related [[homotopical category|homotopical categories]] are best thought of as, well, _models_ for $(\infty,1)$-categories, so various constructions in [[homological algebra]] -- and in the end really all of modern homological algebra -- is best thought of as models for [[stable (infinity,1)-category|stable (infinity,1)-categories]].

This concerns notably

* [[A-infinity category|A-infinity categoires]]

and

* [[pretriangulated dg-category|pretriangulated dg-categoires]]

which, in turn, are already [[enhanced triangulated category|enhanced]] [[triangulated category|triangulated categories]]: namely [[differential graded category|dg]]-[[enriched category|enriched]] versions thereof.

At this point you are urged to really have a look at the entry on [[stable (infinity,1)-category]] and marvel about the fact that 

* **the definition of stable $(\infty,1)$-category is short, simple and transparent**.

It's the most obvious thing in the world. And yet, it turns out that the rather involved definitions of [[derived category|derived]] [[triangulated category]] follow from this simple definition when one decides to look at just the 1-categorical shadow given by the [[homotopy category of an (infinity,1)-category|homotopy category of the stable (infinity,1)-category]].

This is a general pattern here:

* $(\infty,1)$-categorical notions -- and in particular [[quasi-category|quasi-categorical]] notions -- are _conceptually_ simple and lend themselves to the formulation and description of higher categorical situations;

* but for concrete constructions in terms of them there is a wealth of tools with different areas of applicability, many of which have been understood and developed as theories in their own right for a considerable time.



#### 2.2 monoidal $\infty$-categories ####

A central aspect of geometric $\infty$-function theory is that we regard the collection $C(X)$ of $\infty$-functions assigned to a generalized space $X$ (concretely modeled as $QC(X)$, see section 3 below) not just as a higher vector space but naturally as a [[higher algebra]]. Indeed, the central two theorems/properties of [[geometric function theory]] concern the interplay between the _geometry_ of intersections or [[pullback]]s

$$
  \array{
     && Y_1 \times_X Y_2
     \\
     & \swarrow && \searrow
     \\
     Y_1 &&&& Y_2
     \\
     & \searrow && \swarrow
     \\
     && X
  }
$$

of generalized spaces and the _algebra_ of [[tensor product]]s 

$$
  C(Y_1) \otimes_{C(X)} C(Y_2)
  \,.
$$

In order to formulate this, one needs a good general theory of [[higher algebra]]. Just as ordinary [[algebra]] takes place inside a [[monoidal category]], [[higher algebra]] takes place in a [[monoidal (infinity,1)-category]]:

an ‚Äú$\infty$-monoid" or ‚Äú$\infty$-algebra" (to distinguish from the traditional [[A-infinity algebra]], which is supposedly a special case) is an [[algebra in an (infinity,1)-category|algebra/monoid object in a monoidal (infinity,1)-category]].

In order to characterize the $(\infty,1)$-categories $C(X)$ as algebra objects in such a sense we profit from the ease with which [[quasi-category|quasi-categories]] naturally reflect on themselves and allow us with comparative ease to talk about the [[(infinity,1)-category of (infinity,1)-categories]] $(\infty,1)Cat_1$.

Since $(\infty,1)Cat_1$ itself is a [[symmetric monoidal (infinity,1)-category]], we will essentially identify the $\infty$-algebras $C(X)$ as [[algebra in an (infinity,1)-category|algebra objects]] in $(\infty,1)Cat_1$.

But there is actually a slight technical simplification: we don't deal with _all_ $(\infty,1)$-categories, but just with [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presentable (infinifty,1)-categories]]. See there for the (long) list of nice properties and characterization of presentable $(\infty,1)$-categories.

So

* presentable $(\infty,1)$-categories form the [[symmetric monoidal (infinity,1)-category of presentable (infinity,1)-categories]]  $Pr(\infty,1)Cat_1^L$;

* the $\infty$-algebras of $\infty$-functions $C(X)$ are [[algebra in an (infinity,1)-category|algebra objects in]] $Pr(\infty,1)Cat_1^L$.

Notice that this means in particular that the "additive" structure on $C(X)$ is taken to be nothing but the $(\infty,1)$-categorical colimit operation inside $C(X)$: this is the operation with respect to which [[(infinity,1)-functor]]s in $(\infty,1)Cat_1^L$ are linear, and with respect to which the tensor product is bilinear.

In terms of this [[higher algebra]] we will obtain the two central (defining) theorems of _geometric $\infty$-function theory_.

###### Theorem
**Fundamental theorem of geometric $\infty$-function theory**

For $X \to Y \leftarrow X'$ morphisms of nice generalized spaces ([[perfect infinity-stack]]s) and for $\infty$-functions $C(-) = QC(-)$ (given by the assignment of $(\infty,1)$-categories of quasicoherent sheaves) we have

* _$\infty$-matrices (integral transforms) are $\infty$-functions on fiber products_ in that the following equivalence holds: $ C(X \times_Y X') \simeq C(X) \otimes_{C(Y)} C(X')$

* _$\infty$-linear maps are given by $\infty$-matrices in that also the following equivalence holds: $C(X \times_Y X') \simeq Fun_{C(Y)}(C(X), C(Y))$;

#### basic ideas related to $\infty$-stacks ####

The following discussion aims to describe the role played by [[infinity-stack]]s and their morphisms in the context of geometric $\infty$-funcion theory. 

We place ourselves in the context of an [[(infinity,1)-category]]
$H$ of (possibly [[derived stack|derived]]) $\infty$-stacks, i.e. of [[(infinity,1)-sheaf|(infinity,1)-sheaves]].

Recall what this means:

The fundamental datum that we fix once and for all and which determines
what $H$ is like is a choice of [[category]] $S$ equipped with the
structure of a [[site]]. $H$ is going to be the $(\infty,1)$-category
of generalized spaces which may be probed by objects of $S$ in a way
that is consistent with the way one glues objects in $S$ using its 
structure of a [[site]]. More generally, $S$ itself may be an 
$(\infty,1)$-category.

It is actually not hard to say this in a precise and fairly
explicit way.

First the precise way.

* the first datum is: $S$ a [[small (infinity,1)-category]];

* let then $PSh(S) := Funct(S^{op}, \infty\text{-}Grpd)$ be the $(\infty,1)$-category
of [[(infinity,1)-functor]]s from the [[opposite (infinity,1)-category]] $S^{op}$
to the $(\infty,1)$-category of $\infty$-groupoids.

* the second datum is: $i : H \hookrightarrow PSh(S)$ a 
[[full and faithful (infinity,1)-functor|full (infinity,1)-subcategory]] of $PSh(S)$
such that the inclusion is a [[geometric morphism]] of  
[[(infinity,1)-topos|(infinity,1)-topoi]], i.e. such that $i$ has
a [[exact (infinity,1)-functor|left exact]] [[adjoint (infinity,1)-functor|left adjoint]]
$(-)^* : PSh(S) \to H$.

The same in one sentence: $H$ is a sub-[[(infinity,1)-topos]] of the [[(infinity,1)-topos]]
of [[(infinity,1)-presheaf|(infinity,1)-presheaves]] on $S$.

Or equivalently: $H$ is an [[(infinity,1)-category of (infinity,1)-sheaves]] on $S$.


Now the fairly explicit way:

There are various different but equivalent explicit realizations, or models,
for [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categories]]. 
Of these consider [[quasi-category|quasi-categories]], which are  
[[simplicial set]]s that are [[Kan fibration|weak Kan complex]]es,
and [[SSet]]-[[enriched category|enriched categories]]. 
These are related by the 
[[simplicial nerve of simplicial categories]]-functor: 

$$ 
  N : SSet\text{-}Cat \to SSet
$$

which has a [[left adjoint]]

$$ 
  F : SSet \to SSet\text{-}Cat
$$

that sends every simplicial set to the [[SSet]]-[[enriched category]] 
freely generated from it. One can think for $S$ a [[quasi-category]] of $F(S)$
as a semi-strictification of it, in which composition of morphisms along
0-cells is strictly associative.

It is convenient and usual to switch back and forth between these two
models. Quasi-categories tend to give rise to conceptually more transparent
definitions, while [[SSet]]-categories tend to be more convenient
for many explicit computations. 

To get back to our [[(infinity,1)-category of (infinity,1)-sheaves]] $H$,
we describe it in terms of these models as follows.

* $S$ is some small [[simplicial set]] which we can assume to be a [[weak Kan complex]];

* $\infty\text{-}Grpd := N(Kan)$ is the [[simplicial set]] which is the image under
the [[simplicial nerve of simplicial categories]]-functor of the full [[SSet]]-subcategory
of [[SSet]] on [[Kan complex]]es;

* $PSh(S) = SSet(S^{op},\infty\text{-}Grpd)$ is just the simplicial set of
simplicial maps between the simplicial sets $S^{op}$ and $\infty\text{-}Grpd)$.

For explicitly constructing $H$ as a full sub-$(\infty,1)$-category of $PSh(S)$ 
in practice one usually switches from the [[quasi-category]] picture to 
the [[SSet]]-[[enriched category]] picture. So assume $H$ explicitly 
to be an [[SSet]]-[[enriched category]] and $i : H \to F(PSh(S))$
the suitable inclusion [[SSet]]-functor. 

Notice that its left adjoint $(-)^* : PSh(S) \to N(H)$ is 
[[(infinity,1)-sheafification]]: it sends every [[(infinity,1)-presheaf]]
to the corresponding [[(infinity,1)-sheaf]]. In other words, this is
_$\infty$-stackification_. Describing the full $\infty$-stackification of
a given $(\infty,1)$-presheaf explicitly is usually hard. Moreover, it is
usually much more than one wants to actually know. 

Therefore a common approach to constructing $H$ is as an [[SSet]]-[[enriched category]]
which has precisely the same objects as $F(PSh(S))$ has, but where
every object is $(\infty,1)$-equivalent to its $(\infty,1)$-sheafification.
This is in particular what happens in the most developed explicit model
for $H$, due to K. Brown, A. Joyal, J. Jardine and others, in which (for $S$ an
ordinary 1-category) $H$ is constructed as the canonical [[SSet]]-enrichment
of the [[model structure on simplicial presheaves|model category structure on]]
$Funct(S^{op}, SSet)$. 

For such a model of $H$, let $A$ be an object, i.e. an $(\infty,1)$-presheaf
which need not be an $(\infty,1)$-sheaf/$\infty$-stack, and let $X$ be
any other object, then the simplicial set

$$
  H(X,A)
$$

(which, if it is not [[Kan complex|Kan]] already, we are to think of as representing
the $\infty$-groupoid obtained from its [[Kan fibration|Kan-fibration]] replacement)

is _equivalent_ to $H(X,\bar A)$, where $\bar A$ is the $\infty$-stackification of $A$.
 
This is most familiar in detail, if maybe not conceptually, in 
the context of [[abelian sheaf cohomology]]: an (ordinary) [[sheaf]] $A$ with
values in non-negatively graded chain complexes is, by the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]],
a special case of an $(\infty,1)$-presheaf with values in $\infty\text{-}Grpd$.
Computing the [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] of $A$ on $X$ can be understood
as being the computation of the $\infty$-stackification of $A$ evaluated on $X$.

Moreover, for a fixed $(\infty,1)$-presheaf $A$, homming into it yields a functor

$$
  H(-, A) : H^{op} \to SSet
$$

which, being $SSet$-valued, we are entitled to call an $(\infty,1)$-presheaf on $H$. 
In as far as $H$ is thought of as an $(\infty,1)$-category of $\infty$-stacks, this
is an $(\infty,1)$-presheaf or $\infty$-prestack on $\infty$-stacks.

It is natural, suggestive and common to  write $A(X) := H(X,A)$, following
the guide of the [[Yoneda lemma]], even if $X$ is far from being representable.

Let for instance $Vect_\infty \in H$ be an $(\infty,1)$-presheaf
which assigns to each test domain $U \in S$ an $\infty$-groupoid $Vect_\infty(U)$
of some kind of $\infty$-vector bundles on $U$. Then $Vect_\infty$ is,
regarded as a generalized space modeled on $X$, the 
[[classifying space]] of $\infty$-vector bundles, essentially by definition.

So for $X \in H$ any other $\infty$-stack/generalized space,

$$
  Vect_\infty(X) := H(X, Vect_\infty)
$$ 

is the (simplicial set whose Kan-fibrant replacement is) the $\infty$-groupoid of 
(some kind of) $\infty$-vector bundles of on $X$.

If the $X$ here is an $\infty$-groupoid valued presheaf which really takes
values in higher groupoids and not just in sets, then $X$ is actually 
to be regarded as a generalized $\infty$-groupoid itself, of course. One
often thinks of such $X$ as [[orbifold]]s. If we write $X_0 \hookrightarrow X$ for the
presheaf of objects in $X$, then 

* $Vect_\infty(X_0)$ is the $\infty$-groupoid of $\infty$-vector bundles on $X_0$

* $Vect_\infty(X)$ is the $\infty$-groupoid of _equivariant_ $\infty$-vector bundles on $X_0$,

where the equivariance in question is that encoded by the inclusion $X_0 \hookrightarrow X$.

This is notably relevant for the [[fundamental infinity-groupoid]]:

assume that our [[site]] $S$ is 
[[monoidal category|monoidal]] and
equipped with a cosimplicial object, i.e. a functor 
$\Delta_S : \Delta \to S$ from the [[simplex category]], 
such that $\Delta_S[0]$ is a [[generator]] of $S$,
then there is canonically the functor

$$
  \Pi : S \to H
$$

which sends each test object $X_0$ to the $(\infty,1)$-presheaf that sends
each domain $V$ to the $V$-family version of the singular simplicial complex of $U$:

$$
  \Pi(X_0) : U \mapsto S(V \otimes \Delta^\bullet, X_0)
  \,.
$$

The inclusion of the space of objects in $\Pi(X_0)$ is just $X_0 \hookrightarrow \Pi(X_0)$.
From the above we now have

* $H(X_0, Vect_\infty) =: Vect_\infty(X_0)$ is the $\infty$-groupoid of $\infty$-vector bundles on $X_0$

* $H(\Pi(X_0),Vect_\infty)$ =: $Vect_\infty(\Pi(X))$ is the $\infty$-groupoid of $\Pi$-equivariant $\infty$-vector bundles on $X_0$.

By unwrapping what "$\Pi$-equivariance" means, one finds that this may equivalently be stated as

* $H(\Pi(X_0),Vect_\infty)$ =: $Vect_\infty(\Pi(X))$ is the $\infty$-groupoid of flat
$\infty$-vector bundles with connection on $X_0$.

It should be noted here that we can combine different levels of equivariance:

we may left [[Kan extension|Kan extend]] $\Pi : S \to H$ along the inclusion $S \hookrightarrow H$
to a functor $\Pi : H \to H$, so that 
for $X$ itself n $\infty$-orbifold of sorts, $\Pi(X)$ is the fundamental $\infty$-groupoid
of that. We still have a canonical inclusion $X \hookrightarrow \Pi(X)$.
If moreover $X_0 \hookrightarrow X$ is the inclusion from above, we have

* $H(X_0, Vect_\infty) =: Vect_\infty(X_0)$ is the $\infty$-groupoid of $\infty$-vector bundles on $X_0$

* $H(X, Vect_\infty) =: Vect_\infty(X)$ is the $\infty$-groupoid of equivariant $\infty$-vector bundles on $X_0$;

* $H(\Pi(X),Vect_\infty)$ =: $Vect_\infty(\Pi(X))$ is the $\infty$-groupoid of equivariant $\infty$-vector bundles on $X_0$ with flat connection.

Morphisms from the [[fundamental infinity-groupoid]] are also called [[local system]]s.



#### 2.4 derived loop spaces ####

Of particular interest in this study of 
_geometric $\infty$_-function theory is the behaviour of $\infty$-functions on [[loop space object|loop spaces]]. The $(\infty,1)$-category $C(\Lambda X)$ of $\infty$-functions on the free loop space $\Lambda X$ of a sufficiently nice generalized space (a _perfect_ [[infinity-stack]]) $X$ turns out to be the  [[infinity-trace]] or [[infinity-center]] of that of $X$

$$
  C(\Lambda X) \simeq Tr( C(C)) \simeq Tr (C X)
  \,.
$$

which in turn are identified with the $\infty$-version of [[infinity-Hochschild homology]] 

$$
  Tr(C(X)) := HH_*(C(X)) := C(X) \otimes_{C(X)\otimes C(X)^{op}} C(X)
$$ 

and [[infinity-Hochschild cohomology]] 

$$
  Z(C(X)) := HH^*(C(X)) := End_{C(X) \otimes C(X)^{op}}(C(X))
$$ 

of $X$.

All these statements, powerful as they are, become trivialities, due to the naturality of the language that we are using, once we realize the following:

**homotopy pullbacks and loop space objects**

one of the central crucial facts of 
[[higher category theory]] is that 

**the fiber product of a point with itself is not the point, but the [[loop space object]] based at the point**:

let $x : * \to X$ be a morphism from the [[terminal object]] $*$ to some object $X$ in some $\infty$-category, then the $\infty$-categorical pullback of $x$ along itself is the based [[loop space object]] $\Omega_x X$.

$$
  \array{
    \Omega_x X &\to& *
    \\
    \downarrow &\Downarrow& \downarrow^x
    \\
    * &\stackrel{x}{\to}& X
  }
  \,.
$$

This should be intuitively quite clear: the $\infty$-pullback commutes only up to a 2-cell, a homotopy from the constant map on $x$ to the constant map on $x$. But such a homotopy is nothing but a loop in $X$, so $\Omega_x X$ is the object that remembers all possible ways to make this diagram commute up to a 2-cell.

Notice, by the way, that this phenomenon is the source of all "long exact sequences" that you'll ever run into: if we are for instance in a [[stable (infinity,1)-category]], so that the [[terminal object]] $*$ is even a [[zero object]], $* = 0$, then a sequence

$$
  A \to B \to C
$$

is _exact_ (a fibration sequence) if the first morphism is the kernel of the second, meaning that we have a pullback

$$
  \array{
     A &\to& 0
     \\
     \downarrow &\Downarrow& \downarrow
     \\
     B &\to& C
  }
  \,.
$$

But then, since $\infty$-pullback squares compose just as ordinary pullback squares do, further computing the kernel of the kernel $A \to B$ does not produce 0, as it would in an ordinary [[abelian category]], but produces loops in $C$
 
$$
  \array{
     \Omega C &\to&  A &\to& 0
     \\
     \downarrow &\Downarrow& \downarrow &\Downarrow& \downarrow
     \\
     0 &\to& B &\to& C
  }
$$

since the total (outer) diagram is of the form

$$
  \array{
     \Omega C &\to& 0
     \\
     \downarrow &\Downarrow& \downarrow
     \\
     0 &\to& C
  }
  \,.
$$

So 

* **the $\infty$-kernel of an $\infty$-kernel is not 0, but is loops.**

Continuing this way one obtains long exact sequences

$$
  \array{
     \Omega B &\to& 0
     \\
     \downarrow^{\bar \Omega f} && \downarrow
     \\
     \Omega C &\to&  A &\to& 0
     \\
     \downarrow &\Downarrow& \downarrow &\Downarrow& \downarrow
     \\
     0 &\to& B &\stackrel{f}{\to}& C
  }
$$

induced from the single map $f : B \to C$.

For the purposes of geometric $\infty$-function theory what  is more relevant than this construction of based loop spaces as kernels is the construction of _unbased_ [[loop space object]]s. By a similar reasoning, one finds that the free loop space $\Lambda X$ of a generalized space $X$ is the $\infty$-pullback of the morphism $X \stackrel{Id \times Id}{\to}X \times X$ along itself

$$
  \array{
     \Lambda X &\to& X
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow^{Id \times Id}
     \\
     X &\stackrel{Id \times Id}{\to}& X \times X
  }
$$

The intuitive reasoning is the same as before, only that now we don't fix a single point. For more details and in particular for descriptions and examples of how to explicitly compute these loops space objects by [[homotopy limit]]s see the examples listed at

* [[loop space object]]

* [[homotopy limit]]

* [[span trace]]

* [[co-span co-trace]]

* [[generalized universal bundle]].

Notice that when we speak of "homotopy" in the above, we mean _categorical homotopies_. These loop space constructions see only homotopies which actually exist as _morphism_s. If it is isn't clear what is meant by that statement, see the discusssion at [[constant infinity-stack]] for the two different perspectives on a [[topological space]], once as a categorically discrete but topologically non-discrete object, once as a topologically discrete but categorically non-discrete object:

In order for the above homotopy pullbacks to compute the intended loop spaces of topological spaces, these topological spaces need to be regarded as the topologically discrete(!) [[infinity-groupoid]]s they correspond to, i.e. as [[constant infinity-stack]]s.

Now, with the understanding of [[loop space object]]s as homotopy pullbacks understood, the above statement about $\infty$-Hochschild (co)homology becomes essentially a triviality:

we have

$$
  \begin{aligned}
     C(\Lambda X) \simeq 
     C(X \times_{X \times X} X)
     &
     by\;\; loop \;\;space\;\; as \;\;homotopy\;\; pullback
     \\
     \cdots \simeq C(X) \times_{C(X)\times C(X)} C(X)
     &
     by \;\;fundamental \;\;theorem \;\;of\;\; geometric \infty-function\;\; theory
     \\
     \cdots \simeq HH_*(C(X)) :=: Tr(C(X))
     &
     by \;\;definition \;\;of \;\;trace/ Hochschild homology
  \end{aligned}
$$

or equivalently

$$
  \begin{aligned}
     C(\Lambda X) \simeq 
     C(X \times_{X \times X} X)
     &
     by \;\;loop\;\; space\;\; as\;\; homotopy\;\; pullback
     \\
     \cdots \simeq Fun_{C(X)}(C(X), C(X))
     &
     by \;\;fundamental \;\;theorem \;\;of \;\;geometric \infty-function \;\;theory
     \\
     \cdots \simeq HH^*(C(X)) :=: Z(C(X))
     &
     by \;\;definition \;\;of \;\;center/Hochschild cohomology
  \end{aligned}
$$



#### 2.5 $E_n$-structures ####

While for an ordinary [[monoid]]s there is just one notion of commutativity (either it is or it is not commutative), already a [[monoidal category]] distinguishes between being just [[braided monoidal category|braided monoidal]] or fully [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal]].

This pattern continues, as expressed by the [[k-tuply monoidal n-category|periodic table of k-tuply monoidal categories]].

A [[higher category theory|higher category]] may be a [[k-tuply monoidal n-category]] or more generally [[k-tuply monoidal (n,r)-category]] for different values of $k$. The lowest value of $k= 1$ (since for $k = 0$ there is no monoidal structure at all) corresponds to monoidal product which is $\infty$-associative, i.e.  associative up to higher coherent homotopies, but need not have any degree of _commutativity_. 

One says that an $n$-category is _symmetric monoiodal_ if it is "as monoidal as possible", i.e. $\infty$-tuply monoidal. In particular, in [[higher algebra|Noncommutative algebra]] and [[higher algebra|Commutative algebra]] [[Jacob Lurie]] describes

* [[monoidal (infinity,1)-category|1-fold monoidal (infinity,1)-categories]];

* [[symmetric monoidal (infinity,1)-category|infinity-tuply monoidal (infinity,1)-categories]].


It turns out that the monoidal $(\infty,1)$-categories that we are concerned with here in general have a tuplicity  of monoidalness (heh) in between 1 and $\infty$:

For each $1 \leq n \leq \infty$ let $E_n$ denote the [[little n-disk operad|little n-disk]] [[operad]] whose [[topological space]] of $E_n^k$ of $k$-ary operations is the space of embedding of $k$ $n$-dimensional disks (balls) in one $n$-dimensional disk without intersection, and whose composition operation is the obvious one obtained from gluing the big outer disks into given inner disks.

In [John Francis' PhD thesis](http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/43792) (reference _EnAction_ below ) the theory of [[(infinity,1)-categories]] equipped with an action of the $E_n$-[[operad]] is established, so that

* $(\infty,1)$-categories with an $E_1$-action are precisely [[monoidal (infinity,1)-category|monoidal (infinity,1)-categories]] ( _is that right??_ ) -- 1-fold monoidal $(\infty,1)$-categories;

* $(\infty,1)$-categories with an $E_\infty$-action are precisely [[symmetric monoidal (infinity,1)-category|symmetric monoidal (infinity,1)-categories]] -- $\infty$-tuply monoidal $(\infty,1)$-categories;

* $(\infty,1)$-categories with an $E_n$-action for $1 \lt n \lt \infty$ are the corresponding $n$-tuply monoidal $(\infty,1)$-categories in between.


Now, since geometric $\infty$-function theory is indeed _geometric_, we obtain a simple but powerful statement about the $k$-tupliness (heh) of the monoidal structure on our $(\infty,1)$-category of $\infty$-functions $C(X)$ of a space $X$:

As described above, by the _fundamental theorem of geometric $\infty$-function theorey_ , higher traces on $C(X)$ corresponds to forming higher loop spaces of $X$. More generally, the **$E_n$-center** $Z_{E_n}(C(X))$ of $C(X)$ may be taken to be $C([S^n,X])$, where $[S^n, X]$ is my notation for the $n$-sphere space of the generalized space $X$. But there is, 

* by construction, a natural action of $E_{n+1}$ on $[S^n,X]$;

*  accordingly, a natural action of $E_{n+1}$ on $C([S^n,X])$;

*  accordingly, due to the _fundamental theorem_ a natural action of $E_{n+1}$ on $Z_{E_n}(C(X))$.

Again, due to the good formalism, this statement becomes almost a tautology. Notice that this statement is otherwise known as the _Kontsevich conjecture_, which categorifies the _Deligne conjecture_.
