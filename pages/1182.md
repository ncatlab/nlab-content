This entry is about the work by David Ben-Zvi, John Francis and David Nadler on application of a [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categorical]] realization of [[geometric function theory]] to [[FQFT|extended quantum field theory]] in the context in which Jacob Lurie proved the [[generalized tangle hypothesis|cobordism hypothesis]].

So far this work is presented in the two articles

This entry is supposed to be the $n$Lab-working area for a " Journal Club -- Geometric $\infty$-function theory ". The corresponding discussion page at the $n$-Caf&eacute; is [Journal Club -- Geometric Infinity-Function Theory](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/04/journal_club_geometric_infinit.html)

The idea is to 

* jointly discuss at the $n$Caf&eacute; section-by-section these articles; to get an idea for what's going on;

* add here, step by step, links to keywords appearing in these sections, and create the corresponding entries describing them.

* This is supposed to be a recursive and iterative process, which, if successful, will eventually create here a useful repository of entries that describe and explain the various aspects of the topic.

# Timeline #

We will try to proceed as follows: we go through the sections of the two articles, step by step, possibly several steps for one section. Each week on Monday, one of us produces a "report" on the section he or she was assigned to read. 

This "report" would try to give a rough idea of what is going on in a given section. A report may be anything from a  heap of questions (likely) to a complete detailed rederivation of all the details (maybe not quite as likely, but let's not exclude it!) The more questions, the more we all get involved, which is the whole point of doing this online.

I ([[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]) am imagining that whatever the report is like, it consists of 

* a bulleted list of whatever needs to be listed, with links to whatever deserves to be linked to, here in this $n$Lab-entry, in the following list of sections;

* a comment to the [blog entry](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/04/journal_club_geometric_infinit.html) that maybe copies this entire content but at least alerts the blog readers about the new material now to be found here, accompanied by some comments as seems necessary.

The idea is that we have discussion on the blog but distill whatever we can into the $n$Lab here.


Here is the list of reports, as planned so far

#Idea#

The central structural theorem of [[FQFT|TQFT]], the [[generalized tangle hypothesis|cobordism theorem]] states that [[FQFT|(infinity,n)-categorical extended topological quantum field theories]] are entirely determined by their value in the [[point]], which has to be an [[object]] in an [[(infinity,n)-category]] with high dualizability properties.

Very generally, the point of _geometric $\infty$-function theory_ is to construct and study concrete realizations of the [[FQFT]]s guaranteed to exist by this theorem.

The central tool, from which this entry draws its title, is an [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categorical]] version of [[geometric function theory]]: 

the rough idea is that the data the [[FQFT]] assigns to a manifold $\Sigma$ is a collection $Z(\Sigma)$ of $\infty$-functions -- the physical _fields_ -- on $\Sigma$, or, more generally, sections of some $\infty$-bundle on $\Sigma$, and that the morphism $Z(\Sigma) : Z(\Sigma_{in}) \to Z(\Sigma_{out})$ assigned by the [[FQFT]] to a [[cobordism]] $\Sigma : \Sigma_{in} \to \Sigma_{out}$
is obtained from a [[groupoidification|pull-push-operation]] on the objects of $Z(\Sigma_{in})$ through a [[span]] to obtain objects in $Z(\Sigma_{out})$.

This picture arises  naturally and is maybe best understood in terms of [[FQFT]]s that arise as [[sigma-model]]s, namely which are [[representable functor|represented]] by a _target space_ object $P$:

assume that $P$ is some kind of generalized space (which will usually mean: an [[(infinity,1)-sheaf]], see [[heuristic introduction to sheaves, cohomology and higher stacks]] for motivation of this point) and regard the manifolds $\Sigma$ as special cases of generalized manifolds.

Writing $[- , P]$ for the [[closed monoidal category|internal hom]] in the given context, every [[cobordism]] [[cospan]] is sent to a [[span]]

$$
  [-, P]
  : 
  \left(
  \array{
    && \Sigma
    \\
    & \nearrow && \nwarrow
    \\
    \Sigma_{in} &&&& \Sigma_{out}
  }
  \right)
  \mapsto
  \left(
  \array{
    && [\Sigma, P]
    \\
    & {}^{p_1}\swarrow && \searrow^{p_2}
    \\
    [\Sigma_{in}, P] &&&& [\Sigma_{out}, P]
  }
  \right)  
  \,.
$$

If now $C([\Sigma_{in},P])$ denotes some sensible collection of $\infty$-functions on the mapping space $[\Sigma_{in}, P]$, there will be an [[(infinity,1)-category|infinity-categorical]] pull-push operation

$$
  \int_{p_2} p_1^*(-) : C([\Sigma_{in}, P]) \to C([\Sigma_{out}, P])
$$

generalizing the analogous operation as described as [[groupoidification]].

As described as [[geometric function theory]], such pull-push operations can naturally be regarded as vast generalization of familiar [[matrix calculus]], including in particular operations like Fourier-Moukai transformations.


## Summary ##

In __IntTrans__ the basic machinery of these $\infty$-categorical pull-push operations is established.

In _CharTheo_ the particular case of an [[FQFT]] is considered whose defining assigment to the [[point]] is the differential graded Hecke category

$$
  H_G = D( B  \backslash (G/B))
$$ 

of $B$-equivariant D-modules on the flag variety $G/B$ of a complex reductive group $G$ with Borel subgroup $B$.

#### basic ideas related to $\infty$-stacks ####

We place ourselves in the context of an [[(infinity,1)-category]]
$H$ of (possibly [[derived stack|derived]]) $\infty$-stacks, i.e. of [[(infinity,1)-sheaf|(infinity,1)-sheaves]].

Recall what this means:

The fundamental datum that we fix once and for all and which determines
what $H$ is like is a choice of [[category]] $S$ equipped with the
structure of a [[site]]. $H$ is going to be the $(\infty,1)$-category
of generalized spaces which may be probed by objects of $S$ in a way
that is consistent with the way one glues objects in $S$ using its 
structure of a [[site]]. More generally, $S$ itself may be an 
$(\infty,1)$-category.

It is actually not hard to say this in a precise and fairly
explicit way.

First the precise way.

* the first datum is: $S$ a [[small (infinity,1)-category]];

* let then $PSh(S) := Funct(S^{op}, \infty\text{-}Grpd)$ be the $(\infty,1)$-category
of [[(infinity,1)-functor]]s from the [[opposite (infinity,1)-category]] $S^{op}$
to the $(\infty,1)$-category of $\infty$-groupoids.

* the second datum is: $i : H \hookrightarrow PSh(S)$ a 
[[full and faithful (infinity,1)-functor|full (infinity,1)-subcategory]] of $PSh(S)$
such that the inclusion is a [[geometric morphism]] of  
[[(infinity,1)-topos|(infinity,1)-topoi]], i.e. such that $i$ has
a [[exact (infinity,1)-functor|left exact]] [[adjoint (infinity,1)-functor|left adjoint]]
$(-)^* : PSh(S) \to H$.

The same in one sentence: $H$ is a sub-[[(infinity,1)-topos]] of the [[(infinity,1)-topos]]
of [[(infinity,1)-presheaf|(infinity,1)-presheaves]] on $S$.

Or equivalently: $H$ is an [[(infinity,1)-category of (infinity,1)-sheaves]] on $S$.


Now the fairly explicit way:

There are various different but equivalent explicit realizations, or models,
for [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categories]]. 
Of these consider [[quasi-category|quasi-categories]], which are  
[[simplicial set]]s that are [[Kan fibration|weak Kan complex]]es,
and [[SSet]]-[[enriched category|enriched categories]]. 
These are related by the 
[[simplicial nerve of simplicial categories]]-functor: 

$$ 
  N : SSet\text{-}Cat \to SSet
$$

which has a [[left adjoint]]

$$ 
  F : SSet \to SSet\text{-}Cat
$$

that sends every simplicial set to the [[SSet]]-[[enriched category]] 
freely generated from it. One can think for $S$ a [[quasi-category]] of $F(S)$
as a semi-strictification of it, in which composition of morphisms along
0-cells is strictly associative.

It is convenient and usual to switch back and forth between these two
models. Quasi-categories tend to give rise to conceptually more transparent
definitions, while [[SSet]]-categories tend to be more convenient
for many explicit computations. 

To get back to our [[(infinity,1)-category of (infinity,1)-sheaves]] $H$,
we describe it in terms of these models as follows.

* $S$ is some small [[simplicial set]] which we can assume to be a [[weak Kan complex]];

* $\infty\text{-}Grpd := N(Kan)$ is the [[simplicial set]] which is the image under
the [[simplicial nerve of simplicial categories]]-functor of the full [[SSet]]-subcategory
of [[SSet]] on [[Kan complex]]es;

* $PSh(S) = SSet(S^{op},\infty\text{-}Grpd)$ is just the simplicial set of
simplicial maps between the simplicial sets $S^{op}$ and $\infty\text{-}Grpd)$.

For explicitly constructing $H$ as a full sub-$(\infty,1)$-category of $PSh(S)$ 
in practice one usually switches from the [[quasi-category]] picture to 
the [[SSet]]-[[enriched category]] picture. So assume $H$ explicitly 
to be an [[SSet]]-[[enriched category]] and $i : H \to F(PSh(S))$
the suitable inclusion [[SSet]]-functor. 

Notice that its left adjoint $(-)^* : PSh(S) \to N(H)$ is 
[[(infinity,1)-sheafification]]: it sends every [[(infinity,1)-presheaf]]
to the corresponding [[(infinity,1)-sheaf]]. In other words, this is
_$\infty$-stackification_. Describing the full $\infty$-stackification of
a given $(\infty,1)$-presheaf explicitly is usually hard. Moreover, it is
usually much more than one wants to actually know. 

Therefore a common approach to constructing $H$ is as an [[SSet]]-[[enriched category]]
which has precisely the same objects as $F(PSh(S))$ has, but where
every object is $(\infty,1)$-equivalent to its $(\infty,1)$-sheafification.
This is in particular what happens in the most developed explicit model
for $H$, due to K. Brown, A. Joyal, J. Jardine and others, in which (for $S$ an
ordinary 1-category) $H$ is constructed as the canonical [[SSet]]-enrichment
of the [[model structure on simplicial presheaves|model category structure on]]
$Funct(S^{op}, SSet)$. 

For such a model of $H$, let $A$ be an object, i.e. an $(\infty,1)$-presheaf
which need not be an $(\infty,1)$-sheaf/$\infty$-stack, and let $X$ be
any other object, then the simplicial set

$$
  H(X,A)
$$

(which, if it is not [[Kan complex|Kan]] already, we are to think of as representing
the $\infty$-groupoid obtained from its [[Kan fibration|Kan-fibration]] replacement)

is _equivalent_ to $H(X,\bar A)$, where $\bar A$ is the $\infty$-stackification of $A$.
 
This is most familiar in detail, if maybe not conceptually, in 
the context of [[abelian sheaf cohomology]]: an (ordinary) [[sheaf]] $A$ with
values in non-negatively graded chain complexes is, by the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]],
a special case of an $(\infty,1)$-presheaf with values in $\infty\text{-}Grpd$.
Computing the [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] of $A$ on $X$ can be understood
as being the computation of the $\infty$-stackification of $A$ evaluated on $X$.

Moreover, for a fixed $(\infty,1)$-presheaf $A$, homming into it yields a functor

$$
  H(-, A) : H^{op} \to SSet
$$

which, being $SSet$-valued, we are entitled to call an $(\infty,1)$-presheaf on $H$. 
In as far as $H$ is thought of as an $(\infty,1)$-category of $\infty$-stacks, this
is an $(\infty,1)$-presheaf or $\infty$-prestack on $\infty$-stacks.

It is natural, suggestive and common to  write $A(X) := H(X,A)$, following
the guide of the [[Yoneda lemma]], even if $X$ is far from being representable.

Let for instance $Vect_\infty \in H$ be an $(\infty,1)$-presheaf
which assigns to each test domain $U \in S$ an $\infty$-groupoid $Vect_\infty(U)$
of some kind of $\infty$-vector bundles on $U$. Then $Vect_\infty$ is,
regarded as a generalized space modeled on $X$, the 
[[classifiying space]] of $\infty$-vector bundles, essentially by definition.

So for $X \in H$ any other $\infty$-stack/generalized space,

$$
  Vect_\infty(X) := H(X, Vect_\infty)
$$ 

is the (simplicial set whose Kan-fibrant replacement is) the $\infty$-groupoid of 
(some kind of) $\infty$-vector bundles of on $X$.

If the $X$ here is an $\infty$-groupoid valued presheaf which really takes
values in higher groupoids and not just in sets, then $X$ is actually 
to be regarded as a generalized $\infty$-groupoid itself, of course. One
often thinks of such $X$ as [[orbifold]]s. If we write $X_0 \hookrightarrow X$ for the
presheaf of objects in $X$, then 

* $Vect_\infty(X_0)$ is the $\infty$-groupoid of $\infty$-vector bundles on $X_0$

* $Vect_\infty(X)$ is the $\infty$-groupoid of _equivariant_ $\infty$-vector bundles on $X_0$,

where the equivariance in question is that encoded by the inclusion $X_0 \hookrightarrow X$.

This is notably relevant for the [[fundamental infinity-groupoid]]:

assume that our [[site]] $S$ is 
[[monoidal category|monoidal]] and
equipped with a cosimplicial object, i.e. a functor 
$\Delta_S : \Delta \to S$ from the [[simplex category]], 
such that $\Delta_S[0]$ is a [[generators]] of $S$,
then there is canonically the functor

$$
  \Pi : S \to H
$$

which sends each test object $X_0$ to the $(\infty,1)$-presheaf that sends
each domain $V$ to the $V$-family version of the singular simplicial complex of $U$:

$$
  \Pi(X_0) : U \mapsto S(V \otimes \Delta^\bullet, X_0)
  \,.
$$

The inclusion of the space of objects in $\Pi(X_0)$ is just $X_0 \hookrigtharrow \Pi(X_0)$.
From the above we now have

* $H(X_0, Vect_\infty) =: Vect_\infty(X_0)$ is the $\infty$-groupoid of $\infty$-vector bundles on $X_0$

* $H(\Pi(X_0),Vect_\infty)$ =: $Vect_\infty(\Pi(X))$ is the $\infty$-groupoid of $\Pi$-equivariant $\infty$-vector bundles on $X_0$.

By unwrapping what "$\Pi$-equivariance" means, one finds that this may equivalently be stated as

* $H(\Pi(X_0),Vect_\infty)$ =: $Vect_\infty(\Pi(X))$ is the $\infty$-groupoid of flat
$\infty$-vector bundles with connection on $X_0$.

It should be noted here that we can combine different levels of equivariance:

we may left [[Kan extension|Kan extend]] $\Pi : S \to H$ along the inclusion $S \hookrightarrow H$
to a functor $\Pi : H \to H$, so that 
for $X$ itself n $\infty$-orbifold of sorts, $\Pi(X)$ is the fundamental $\infty$-groupoid
of that. We still have a canonical inclusion $X \hookrightarrow \Pi(X)$.
If moreover $X_0 \hookrightarrow X$ is the inclusion from above, we have

* $H(X_0, Vect_\infty) =: Vect_\infty(X_0)$ is the $\infty$-groupoid of $\infty$-vector bundles on $X_0$

* $H(X, Vect_\infty) =: Vect_\infty(X)$ is the $\infty$-groupoid of equivariant $\infty$-vector bundles on $X_0$;

* $H(\Pi(X),Vect_\infty)$ =: $Vect_\infty(\Pi(X))$ is the $\infty$-groupoid of equivariant $\infty$-vector bundles on $X_0$ with flat connection.
