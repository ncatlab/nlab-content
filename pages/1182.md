This entry is about the work by David Ben-Zvi, John Francis and David Nadler on application of a [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categorical]] realization of [[geometric function theory]] to [[FQFT|extended quantum field theory]] in the context in which Jacob Lurie proved the [[generalized tangle hypothesis|cobordism hypothesis]].

So far this work is presented in the two articles

* **IntTrans** David Ben-Zvi, John Francis, David Nadler, _Integral transforms and Drinfeld Centers in Derived Geometry_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.0157))

* **CharTheo** David Ben-Zvi, David Nadler, _The Character Theory of a Complex Group_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.1247))

This entry is supposed to be the $n$Lab-working area for a " Journal Club -- Geometric $\infty$-function theory ". The corresponding discussion page at the $n$-Caf&eacute; is [Journal Club -- Geometric Infinity-Function Theory](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/04/journal_club_geometric_infinit.html)

The idea is to 

* jointly discuss at the $n$Caf&eacute; section-by-section these articles; to get an idea for what's going on;

* add here, step by step, links to keywords appearing in these sections, and create the corresponding entries describing them.

* This is supposed to be a recursive and iterative process, which, if successful, will eventually create here a useful repository of entries that describe and explain the various aspects of the topic.

# Timeline #

We will try to proceed as follows: we go through the sections of the two articles, step by step, possibly several steps for one section. Each week on Monday, one of us produces a "report" on the section he or she was assigned to read. 

This "report" would try to give a rough idea of what is going on in a given section. A report may be anything from a  heap of questions (likely) to a complete detailed rederivation of all the details (maybe not quite as likely, but let's not exclude it!) The more questions, the more we all get involved, which is the whole point of doing this online.

I ([[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]) am imagining that whatever the report is like, it consists of 

* a bulleted list of whatever needs to be listed, with links to whatever deserves to be linked to, here in this $n$Lab-entry, in the following list of sections;

* a comment to the [blog entry](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/04/journal_club_geometric_infinit.html) that maybe copies this entire content but at least alerts the blog readers about the new material now to be found here, accompanied by some comments as seems necessary.

The idea is that we have discussion on the blog but distill whatever we can into the $n$Lab here.


Here is the list of reports, as planned so far

* Monday, April 27: [[Alex Hoffnung|Alex]] on section 1, [Introduction](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/0805/0805.0157v4.pdf#page=2)

* Monday, May 4: [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]] on section 2, [Preliminaries](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/0805/0805.0157v4.pdf#page=10)

* Monday, May 11: [[Bruce Bartlett|Bruce]] on section 3, [Perfect Stacks](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/0805/0805.0157v4.pdf#page=16)

* Monday, May 18: somebody on section 4, [Tensor products and integral transforms](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/0805/0805.0157v4.pdf#page=24)

#Idea#

The central structural theorem of [[FQFT|TQFT]], the [[generalized tangle hypothesis|cobordism theorem]] states that [[FQFT|(infinity,n)-categorical extended topological quantum field theories]] are entirely determined by their value in the [[point]], which has to be an [[object]] in an [[(infinity,n)-category]] with high dualizability properties.

Very generally, the point of _geometric $\infty$-function theory_ is to construct and study concrete realizations of the [[FQFT]]s guaranteed to exist by this theorem.

The central tool, from which this entry draws its title, is an [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categorical]] version of [[geometric function theory]]: 

the rough idea is that the data the [[FQFT]] assigns to a manifold $\Sigma$ is a collection $Z(\Sigma)$ of $\infty$-functions -- the physical _fields_ -- on $\Sigma$, or, more generally, sections of some $\infty$-bundle on $\Sigma$, and that the morphism $Z(\Sigma) : Z(\Sigma_{in}) \to Z(\Sigma_{out})$ assigned by the [[FQFT]] to a [[cobordism]] $\Sigma : \Sigma_{in} \to \Sigma_{out}$
is obtained from a [[groupoidification|pull-push-operation]] on the objects of $Z(\Sigma_{in})$ through a [[span]] to obtain objects in $Z(\Sigma_{out})$.

This picture arises  naturally and is maybe best understood in terms of [[FQFT]]s that arise as [[sigma-model]]s, namely which are [[representable functor|represented]] by a _target space_ object $P$:

assume that $P$ is some kind of generalized space (which will usually mean: an [[(infinity,1)-sheaf]], see [[heuristic introduction to sheaves, cohomology and higher stacks]] for motivation of this point) and regard the manifolds $\Sigma$ as special cases of generalized manifolds.

Writing $[- , P]$ for the [[closed monoidal category|internal hom]] in the given context, every [[cobordism]] [[cospan]] is sent to a [[span]]

$$
  [-, P]
  : 
  \left(
  \array{
    && \Sigma
    \\
    & \nearrow && \nwarrow
    \\
    \Sigma_{in} &&&& \Sigma_{out}
  }
  \right)
  \mapsto
  \left(
  \array{
    && [\Sigma, P]
    \\
    & {}^{p_1}\swarrow && \searrow^{p_2}
    \\
    [\Sigma_{in}, P] &&&& [\Sigma_{out}, P]
  }
  \right)  
  \,.
$$

If now $C([\Sigma_{in},P])$ denotes some sensible collection of $\infty$-functions on the mapping space $[\Sigma_{in}, P]$, there will be an [[(infinity,1)-category|infinity-categorical]] pull-push operation

$$
  \int_{p_2} p_1^*(-) : C([\Sigma_{in}, P]) \to C([\Sigma_{out}, P])
$$

generalizing the analogous operation as described as [[groupoidification]].

As described as [[geometric function theory]], such pull-push operations can naturally be regarded as vast generalization of familiar [[matrix calculus]], including in particular operations like Fourier-Moukai transformations.


## Summary ##

In __IntTrans__ the basic machinery of these $\infty$-categorical pull-push operations is established.

In _CharTheo_ the particular case of an [[FQFT]] is considered whose defining assigment to the [[point]] is the differential graded Hecke category

$$
  H_G = D( B  \backslash (G/B))
$$ 

of $B$-equivariant D-modules on the flag variety $G/B$ of a complex reductive group $G$ with Borel subgroup $B$.
