## Idea

Perturbative quantum field theory is [[quantum field theory]] where the [[interaction]] (between [[field (physics)|fields]]/[[particles]]) is treated as a tiny [[perturbation]] of the [[free field theory]], so that the resulting [[quantum observables]] are [[formal power series]] (in [[Planck's constant]] and) in the [[coupling constant]] which measures the strength of the interaction ("[[perturbation theory]]"). 

The key object of perturbative QFT is the perturbative _[[scattering matrix]]_ which expresses, as a [[formal power series]] in the ratio of the [[coupling constant]] over [[Planck's constant]], the [[probability amplitude]] of [[scattering]] processes, namely of processes where [[free field theory|free fields]] in a certain [[quantum state|state]] come in from the far past, interact and hence scatter off each other, and then go off in some other state into the far future. The [[scattering cross sections]] that defined are the quantities which may be directly measured in scattering [[experiments]], such as the [[LHC]] accelerator.

The perturbative [[S-matrix]] may be expresses as a sum over separate [[scattering amplitudes]] for elementary processes labeled by _[[Feynman diagram]]_ which each depict one way specific way for fields/[[particles]] to interact with each other. That the full S-matrix is the sum over all amplitudes for all these possible scattering processes is an incarnation of the informal idea of the [[path integral]] and the [[superposition principle]] in [[quantum physics]], which says that the [[probability amplitude]] for a specific outcome is the sum over the probability amplitudes of all the possible processes that can contribute to this outcome.

For all interesting [[theory (physics)|theories]] this [[scattering matrix]] [[formal power series]] has vanishing [[radius of convergence]] ([Dyson 52](perturbation+theory#Dyson52)) and is regarded as an [[asymptotic series]]. Despite this apparent restriction, the perturbative quantum field theory of the [[standard model of particle physics]], where just the first handful of terms in the [[Feynman perturbation series]] is used, are in agreement with [[experiment]] to high precision. There are however [[non-perturbative effects]] which are not captured (such as [[instantons in QCD]]).

Historically, perturbative quantum field theory (as first conceived by Tomonaga, Schwinger, Feynman and Dyson) had been notorious for the mysterious nature of its mathematical principles. But a mathematically rigorous formulation of perturbative quantum field theory had been established around 1973 8by Epstein and Glaser, based on work by ), known as _[[causal perturbation theory]]_ and, since around 2001, further developed to _[[perturbative algebraic quantum field theory]]_. 

A key step in the construction of perturbative quantum field theory is the _[[renormalization]]_ of the point interactions. This is because given

1. a [[local Lagrangian density]] defining the nature of the [[field (physics)|fields]] and their [[interactions]], 

1. a [[vacuum state]] (generally: [[Hadamard state]]) that defines the [[free field theory|free]] [[quantum field theory]] to be perturbed about

it turns that the construction of the perturbative [[S-matrix]] (the [[Feynman perturbation series]]) that defines the interacting perturbative field theory still involves at each order a finite-dimensional space of choices to be made. Physically these are the specification of further high energy interactions not seen in the original [[local Lagrangian density]], mathematically this is the choice of extending the [[time-ordered product]] of the interaction, which is an [[operator-valued distribution]], to the locus of coinciding interaction points, in the sense of [[extensions of distributions]].


The prescription for the construction of the perturbative [[S-matrix]] in [[causal perturbation theory]] and the perturbative [[local net of quantum observables]] (see [here](S-matrix#CausalLocality)) used to be somewhat ad-hoc, albeit well motivated by [[analogy]] with [[quantum mechanics]] and justified by it producing, rigorousy, the [[Feynman perturbation series]] of the [[S-matrix]] ([Keller 10 (IV.12)](#Keller10)).

Historically the [[Feynman perturbation series]] was motivated from intuition about the would-be [[path integral]], and this is still a popular point of view, albeit its lack of rigorous formulation. One may understand the axiomatics on the [[S-matrix]] in [[causal perturbation theory]] as defining the result of the perturbative path integral without actually doing an integration over field configurations.

But while [[path integral quantization]] for perturbative quantum field theory remains elusive, it has been shown that the (re-)normalized [[perturbative quantum field theory]] thus constructed via [[causal perturbation theory]] is, at least under favorable circumstances, equivalently the ([[Fedosov deformation quantization|Fedosov]]) [[formal deformation quantization]] of the [[covariant phase space]] induced by the given interacting [[Lagrangian density]] ([Collini 16](#Collini16)). This identifies the [[renormalization]] freedom with the usual freedom in choosing [[formal deformation quantization]]. 

This also suggest that the construction of the full [[non-perturbative quantum field theory]] ought to be given by a [[strict deformation quantization]] of the [[covariant phase space]]. But presently no example of such for non-trivial interaction in [[spacetime]] [[dimension]] $\geq 4$ is known.
In particular the [[phenomenology|phenomenologically]] interesting case of a complete construction of interacting field theories on 4-dimensional spacetimes is presently unknown. For the case of [[Yang-Mills theory]] this open problem is one of the "Millenium Problems" (see at _[[quantization of Yang-Mills theory]]_).
