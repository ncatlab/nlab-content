## Idea

Perturbative quantum field theory is [[quantum field theory]] where the [[interaction]] (between [[field (physics)|fields]]/[[particles]]) is treated as a tiny [[perturbation]] of the [[free field theory]], so that the resulting [[quantum observables]] are [[formal power series]] (in [[Planck's constant]] and) in the [[coupling constant]] which measures the strength of the interaction ("[[perturbation theory]]"). 

For all interesting theories this [[formal power series]] has vanishing [[radius of convergence]] ([Dyson 52](perturbation+theory#Dyson52)) and is regarded as an [[asymptotic series]]. Despite this apparent restriction, the perturbative quantum field theory of the [[standard model of particle physics]], where just the first handful of terms in the [[Feynman perturbation series]] is used, are in agreement with [[experiment]] to high precision. There are however [[non-perturbative effects]] which are not captured (such as [[instantons in QCD]]).

A rigorous formulation of perturbative quantum field theory is given by _[[causal perturbation theory]]_ and its extension to _[[perturbative algebraic quantum field theory]]_. See there for more. A key step in the construction is the _[[renormalization]]_ of the point interactions, see there for more.

The prescription for the construction of the perturbative [[S-matrix]] in [[causal perturbation theory]] and the perturbative [[local net of quantum observables]] (see [here](S-matrix#CausalLocality)) used to be ad-hoc, albeit well motivated by [[analogy]] with [[quantum mechanics]] and justified by it producing, rigorousy, the [[Feynman perturbation series]] of the [[S-matrix]] ([Keller 10 (IV.12)](#Keller10)).

Historically the [[Feynman perturbation series]] was motivated from intuition about the would-be [[path integral]], and this is still a popular point of view, albeit its lack of rigorous formulation. One may understand the axiomatics on the [[S-matrix]] in [[causal perturbation theory]] as defining the result of the perturbative path integral without actually doing an integration over field configurations.

But while [[path integral quantization]] for perturbative quantum field theory remains elusive, it has been shown that the (re-)normalized [[perturbative quantum field theory]] thus constructed via [[causal perturbation theory]] is, at least under favorable circumstances, equivalently the ([[Fedosov deformation quantization|Fedosov]]) [[formal deformation quantization]] of the [[covariant phase space]] induced by the given interacting [[Lagrangian density]] ([Collini 16](#Collini16)). This identifies the [[renormalization]] freedom with the usual freedom in choosing [[formal deformation quantization]]. 

This also suggest that the construction of the full [[non-perturbative quantum field theory]] ought to be given by a [[strict deformation quantization]] of the [[covariant phase space]]. But presently no example of such for non-trivial interaction in [[spacetime]] [[dimension]] $\geq 4$ is known.
In particular the [[phenomenology|phenomenologically]] interesting case of a complete construction of interacting field theories on 4-dimensional spacetimes is presently unknown. For the case of [[Yang-Mills theory]] this open problem is one of the "Millenium Problems" (see at _[[quantization of Yang-Mills theory]]_).
