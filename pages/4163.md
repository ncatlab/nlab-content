## Idea

What is called _perturbative quantum field theory_ (pQFT) is [[quantum field theory]] where the [[interaction]] (between [[field (physics)|fields]]/[[particles]]) is treated as a tiny [[perturbation]] of the "[[free field theory]]" where no interaction is assumed to takes place ("[[perturbation theory]]"). This is meant to be an approximation to the actual _[[non-perturbative quantum field theory]]_. However, the latter remains elusive except for toy examples of low spacetime dimension, vanishing interaction and/or [[topological field theory|topological invariance]] and most of the "quantum field theory" in the literature is tacitly understood to be perturbative.

Hence pQFT studies the _[[infinitesimal neighbourhood]]_ (also called the _[[formal neighbourhood]]_) of [[free quantum field theories]] in the space of all quantum field theories. Mathematically this means that the resulting [[quantum observables]] are [[formal power series]] in the [[coupling constant]]  $g$ which measures the strength of the interaction (as well as in _[[Planck's constant]]_, which measures the general strength of [[quantum physics|quantum]]). This distinguishes perturbative quantum field theory from [[non-perturbative quantum field theory]], where the algebras of [[quantum observables]] are supposed to be not formal power series algebras, but [[C*-algebras]].

The key object of perturbative QFT is the perturbative _[[scattering matrix]]_ which expresses, as a [[formal power series]] in the ratio of the [[coupling constant]] over [[Planck's constant]], the [[probability amplitude]] of [[scattering]] processes, namely of processes where [[free field theory|free fields]] in a certain [[quantum state|state]] come in from the far past, interact and hence scatter off each other, and then go off in some other [[quantum state]] into the far future. The [[scattering cross sections]] thus defined are the quantities which may be directly measured in scattering [[experiments]], such as the [[LHC]] accelerator.

The perturbative [[S-matrix]] turns out to have an expression as a sum over separate [[scattering amplitudes]] for elementary processes labeled by _[[Feynman diagrams]]_, each of which depicts one specific way for fields ([[particles]]) to interact with each other. That the full S-matrix is the sum over all amplitudes for all these possible scattering processes, the _[[Feynman perturbation series]]_, is an incarnation of the informal heuristic of the [[path integral]] and the [[superposition principle]] in [[quantum physics]], which says that the [[probability amplitude]] for a specific outcome is the sum over the probability amplitudes of all the possible processes that can contribute to this outcome. 

For all interesting interacting [[theory (physics)|theories]], such as [[quantum electrodynamics]] and [[quantum chromodynamics]], this [[scattering matrix]] [[formal power series]] necessarily has _vanishing_ [[radius of convergence]] ([Dyson 52](#Dyson52)). It is regarded as an [[asymptotic series]] whose first couple of terms sum to a good approximation of the actual value to be computed. Indeed, the sum of the first few loop orders in the [[S-matrix]] for  [[QED]] and [[QCD]] in the [[standard model of particle physics]] turns out to be in agreement with [[experiment]] to high precision. 

(There are however known [[non-perturbative effects]] which are not captured in perturbation theory, such as [[instantons in QCD]]. In [[resurgence theory]] one tries to identify these from the nature of the perturbation series.)

A key step in the construction of perturbative quantum field theory is the _[[renormalization]]_ of the point interactions. This comes about because given

1. a [[local Lagrangian density]] defining the nature of the [[field (physics)|fields]] and their [[interactions]], 

1. a [[vacuum state]] (generally: [[Hadamard state]]) that defines the [[free field theory|free]] [[quantum field theory]] to be perturbed about

it turns out that the construction of the perturbative [[S-matrix]] (the [[Feynman perturbation series]]) still involves at each order a finite-dimensional space of choices to be made. Physically, these are the specification of further high energy interactions not seen in the original [[local Lagrangian density]]; mathematically, this is the choice of extending the [[time-ordered product]] of the interaction, which is an [[operator-valued distribution]], to the locus of coinciding interaction points, in the sense of [[extensions of distributions]].

Historically, perturbative quantum field theory as originally conceived informally by [[Tomonaga]], [[Schwinger]], [[Feynman]] and [Dyson 49](#Dyson49), had been notorious for the mysterious nature of its mathematical principles ("divergencies"). The mathematically rigorous formulation of [[renormalization]] ("removal of UV-divergencies") in perturbative quantum field theory on [[Minkowski spacetime]] was established by [Epstein-Glaser 73](#EpsteinGlaser73), based on [Bogoliubov-Shirkov 59](#BogoliubovShirkov59) and [Stückelberg 51](#Stueckelberg51)), now known as **[[causal perturbation theory]]**.  
The correct definition of the [[adiabatic switching|adiabatic limit]] ("removal of IR divergencies") was understood in [Il'in-Slavnov 78](#IlinSlavnov78) and eventually developed by [Dütsch-Fredenhagen 01](#DuetschFredenhagen01), [Brunetti-DütschFredenhagen 09](#BrunettiDuetschFredenhagen09), this is now called **[[perturbative algebraic quantum field theory]]**. 
The rigorous derivation of the previously informal [[Feynman rules]] and their [[dimensional regularization]] for computation of [[scattering amplitudes]] was achieved in [Keller 10 (IV.12)](#Keller10), [Dütsch-Fredenhagen-Keller-Rejzner 14](#DuetschFredenhagenKellerRejzner14).
Quantization of [[gauge theories]] ([[Yang-Mills theory]]) in [[causal perturbation theory]]/[[perturbative AQFT]] was then discussed (for trivial [[principal bundles]] and restricted to [[gauge invariant observables]]) in the spirit of [[BRST-complex]]/[[BV-formalism]] in ([Fredenhagen-Rejzner 11b](#FredenhagenRejzner11b)).
The generalization of all these constructions from [[Minkowski spacetime]] to perturbative quantum fields on more general [[spacetimes]] (i.e. for more general [[gravity|gravitational]] [[background fields]] such as appearing in [[cosmology]] or [[black hole]] physics) was made possible due to the identification of the proper generalization of [[vacuum states]] and their [[Feynman propagators]] to [[Hadamard states]] on [[globally hyperbolic spacetimes]] in [Radzikowski 96](#Radzikowski96). The resulting rigorous perturbative [[QFT on curved spacetimes]] was developed in a long series of articles by [[Stefan Hollands|Hollands]], [[Robert Wald|Wald]], [[Romeo Brunetti|Brunetti]], [[Klaus Fredenhagen|Fredenhagen]] and others, now called _[[locally covariant perturbative AQFT]]_. 

While this establishes a rigorous construction of perturbative quantum field theory on general gravitational backgrounds, the construction principles had remained somewhat ad-hoc: The [[axioms]] for the perturbative [[S-matrix]] (equivalently for the [[time-ordered products]] or [[retarded products]] of field operators) were well motivated by comparison with the [[Dyson series]] in [[quantum mechanics]], by the heuristics of the [[path integral]] and not the least by their excellent confirmation by [[experiment]], but had not been derived from first principles of [[quantization]].  Then in [Dütsch Fredenhagen 01](#DuetschFredenhagen01) it was observed that the [[Wick algebras]] of [[quantum observables]] in [[free quantum field theory]] are equivalently the [[Moyal deformation quantization]] of the canonical [[Poisson bracket]] (the _[[Peierls bracket]]_ or _[[causal propagator]]_) on the [[covariant phase space]] of the free field theory (or rather of a choice of [[Hadamard state]] for it) and [Collini 16](#Collini16) showed that under suitable conditions the perturbative [[interacting observable algebra]] is the [[Fedosov deformation quantization]] of [[covariant phase space]] of the interacting theory. A general argument to this extent was given in [Hawkins-Rejzner 16](#HawkinsRejzner16).

This suggests that the construction of the full [[non-perturbative quantum field theory]] ought to be given by a [[strict deformation quantization]] of the [[covariant phase space]]. But presently no example of such for non-trivial interaction in [[spacetime]] [[dimension]] $\geq 4$ is known.
In particular the [[phenomenology|phenomenologically]] interesting case of a complete construction of interacting field theories on 4-dimensional spacetimes is presently unknown. For the case of [[Yang-Mills theory]] this open problem to go beyond perturbative quantum field theory is one of the "Millenium Problems" (see at _[[quantization of Yang-Mills theory]]_). For the case of [[quantum gravity]] this is possibly the $10^4$-year problem that the field is facing. But observe that as a perturbative ([[effective quantum field theory|effective]]") quantum field theory, [[quantum gravity]] does fit into the framework of  perturbative QFT, is mathematically well-defined and makes predictions, see the references [there](quantum%20gravity#ReferencesAsAnEffectiveFieldTheory).
