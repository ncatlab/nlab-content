## Idea

In the language of [[(∞,1)-topos theory]] the ordinary definition of [[gerbe]] has the following simple re-formulation: 

In a given [[(2,1)-topos]], a _[[gerbe]]_ is an object which is 

1. [[1-connective]];

1. [[1-truncated]].

There are various evident generalizations of this, where one allows the degree in either of the two clauses to vary. In the literature one finds higher gerbes defined in either way, and so there are more general and more specific definitions.

## Definition

###### Definition

Let $\mathcal{X}$ be an [[(∞,1)-topos]].

For $n \in \overline{\mathbb{N}}$ an [[extended natural number]], 

* a **general $n$-gerbe** is an object $\mathcal{G} \in \mathbf{G}$ that is 

  1. [[1-connective]];

  1. [[n-truncated]].

* a **restricted $n$-gerbe** is an object $\mathcal{G} \in \mathbf{G}$ that is 

  1. [[n-connective]]

  1. [[n-truncated]].

=--

The definition of "restricted" $n$-gerbe appears as [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, def. 7.2.2.20]]. For $n = 2$ the definition of "general $n$-gerbe" (called a _nonabelian 2-gerbe_ at [[2-gerbe]]) appears for instance in ([Breen](#Breen))

###### Remark

If one adds the condition that $\mathcal{G}$ has a global section $* \to \mathcal{G}$, then this defines an [[Eilenberg-MacLane object]] in degree $n$.

Notice that the notion of [[bundle gerbe]] and [[bundle 2-gerbe]] etc. is not unrelated, but is _a priori_ a rather different notion.
