The **correspondence theory of truth** is generally applied to any view explicitly embracing the idea that the truth of propositions consists in their relation to reality, i.e., that truth is a relational property been judgments and some portion of reality.

According to some commentators, one version of the correspondence theory is the theory of  _[[truth]]_ in [[object languages]] with respect to [[metalanguages]] due to [[Alfred Tarski]]. However, the bearing of this on a correspondence theory of truth is debated ([SEP: The Correspondence Theory of Truth](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-correspondence/#7.2)).
