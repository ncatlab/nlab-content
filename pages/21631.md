## Idea 

A _univalent foundations for mathematics_ refers to any [[foundations of mathematics|foundational system]] in which [[universes]] are [[object classifiers]], or, equivalently, satisfy the [[univalence axiom]].


### In higher topos theory 

See at _[[object classifier]]_.

### In homotopy type theory

Voevodsky's univalent foundations ([UFIAS 12](#UFIAS12)) are an extension of [[Martin-LÃ¶f's dependent type theory]] obtained by adding:

* the [[univalence axiom]],

* [[propositional truncations]].

Notice that:

* [[function extensionality]] is implied by the [[univalence axiom]], so it is not necessary to assume separately;

* [[propositional resizing]] is sometimes also as an axiom;

* the [[UniMath]] library also uses _type in type_, which leads to an [[inconsistency]] via [[Girard's paradox]].
