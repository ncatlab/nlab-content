An **effective epimorphism** (in a given category) is any morphism that has a [[kernel pair]] and is the [[quotient object]] of its kernel pair.  (Sometimes we say that this morphism is an [[effective quotient]].)  The [[duality|dual]] concept is that of [[effective monomorphism]].

An effective epimorphism is necessarily a [[regular epimorphism]].  Conversely, any regular epimorphism that has a kernel pair is an effective epimorphism.

In [[Set|the category of sets]], every [[epimorphism]] is effective. Thus, it can be hard to know, when generalising concepts from $\Set$ to other categories, what kind of epimorphism to use.  In particular, one may define a [[projective object]] (and hence the [[axiom of choice]]) using effective epimorphisms.


## $(\infty,1)$-concept ##

In an $(\infty,1)$-[[(infinity,1)-topos|topos]] $C$, an _effective epimorphism_ 
$f : U \to X$ is a morphism such that its [[Čech nerve]] $U_\bullet$
is a [[simplicial resolution]] of $X$.

Presumably, we get the general definition in an arbitary $(\infty,1)$-[[(infinity,1)-category|category]] by simply including the requirement that $f$ *have* a Čech nerve.  In an $(\infty,1)$-topos, is there any distinction to be drawn between an effective epimorphism and a regular epimorphism?  (There isn\'t in a [[topos]].)
