# Effective epimorphisms

## Idea

An _effective epimorphism_ is a [[morphism]] $c\to d$ in a [[category]] which behaves in the way that a [[covering]] is expected to behave, in the sense that "$d$ is the union of the parts of $c$, identified with each other in some specified way".

A morphism with a [[kernel pair]] (such as any morphism in a category with [[pullbacks]]) is an effective epimorphism if and only if it is a [[regular epimorphism]] and a [[strict epimorphism]].  For morphisms without kernel pairs, the notion of effective epimorphism is of questionable usefulness.


## Definition 

An **effective epimorphism** in a [[category]] $C$ is a [[morphism]] $f : c \to d$ that has a [[kernel pair]] $c \times_d c$ and is the [[quotient object]] of this kernel pair, in that 

$$
  c \times_d c \;\rightrightarrows\; c \overset{f}{\to} d
$$

is a [[colimit]] diagram (a [[coequalizer]]).

In other words, this says that $f : c \to d$ is effective if $d$ is the [[coimage]] of $f$.

Sometimes we say that such morphism $f$ is an [[effective quotient]].

The [[duality|dual]] concept is that of [[effective monomorphism]].


## Relationship to other epimorphism classes

Every effective epimorphism is, of course, a [[regular epimorphism]] and hence a [[strict epimorphism]].  Conversely, a strict epimorphism which *has* a kernel pair is necessarily an effective epimorphism.  (This is a special case of the theory of [[generalized kernels]].)  For this reason, some writers use "effective epimorphism" in general to mean what is here called a [[strict epimorphism]].


## Examples

* In [[Set|the category of sets]], every [[epimorphism]] is effective.  Thus, it can be hard to know, when generalising concepts from $\Set$ to other categories, what kind of epimorphism to use.  In particular, one may define a [[projective object]] (and hence the [[axiom of choice]]) using effective epimorphisms.

* More generally, in any [[pretopos]], every [[epimorphism]] is an effective epimorphism.  See, for instance, ([MacLane-Moerdijk, theorem IV.7.8](#MacLaneMoerdijk)).
