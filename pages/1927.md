# Effective epimorphisms

## Idea

* [[effective epimorphism]] $\Rightarrow$ [[regular epimorphism]] $\Leftrightarrow$ [[covering]]

* [[effective monomorphism]] $\Rightarrow$ [[regular monomorphism]] $\Leftrightarrow$ [[embedding]] .


## Definition 


+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition


An **effective epimorphism** in a [[category]] $C$ is a [[morphism]] $f : c \to d$ that has a [[kernel pair]] $c \times_d c$ and is the [[quotient object]] of this kernel pair in that 

$$
  c \times_d c \stackrel{\to}{\to} c \stackrel{f}{\to} d
$$

is a [[colimit]] diagram (a [[coequalizer]]).  

In other words this says that $f : c \to d$ is effective if $d$ is the [[coimage]] of $f$.

Sometimes we say that such morphism $f$ is an [[effective quotient]].

=--

The [[duality|dual]] concept is that of [[effective monomorphism]].

###### Remark

This is equivalent to saying that $f$ is a [[regular epimorphism]] which has a kernel pair, since any morphism which is a coequalizer and has a kernel pair must be the coequalizer of its kernel pair.  (This is a special case of the theory of [[generalized kernels]].)

###### Remark

The reader should be aware that some writers use "effective epimorphism" to mean what is here called a [[strict epimorphism]].

## Properties

* An effective epimorphism is necessarily a [[regular epimorphism]].  Conversely, any regular epimorphism that has a kernel pair is an 
effective epimorphism.

## Examples

###### Proposition

In [[Set|the category of sets]], every [[epimorphism]] is effective. 

=--

Thus, it can be hard to know, when generalising concepts from $\Set$ to other categories, what kind of epimorphism to use.  In particular, one may define a [[projective object]] (and hence the [[axiom of choice]]) using effective epimorphisms.


More generally:

###### Proposition

In every [[topos]] every [[epimorphism]] is an effective epimorphism
