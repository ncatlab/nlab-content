## Idea

In [[measure theory]], a _null set_ is a [[subset]] of a [[measure space]] (or [[measurable space]]) that is so small that it can be neglected: it might as well be the [[empty subset]]; its measure is [[zero]].  Similarly, a _full set_ is a subset that is so large that it might as well be the [[improper subset]] (the entire space).  One also says that a null set has _null measure_ and a full set has _full measure_.

Traditionally, full sets are not usually referred to explicitly; in [[classical mathematics]], they are simply the [[complements]] of null sets.  However, they are often referred to implicitly through such terminology as 'almost everywhere'.  Also, in [[constructive mathematics]], full sets are more fundamental than null sets; they are not simply the complements of the latter.


## Definitions

The definitions depend on the context.


### In a measure space

In a traditional [[measure space]], we have an abstract [[set]] $X$, a $\sigma$-[[sigma-algebra|algebra]] (or similar structure) $\mathcal{M}$ consisting of the [[measurable subsets]] of $X$, and a [[measure]] $\mu$ mapping each measurable set $A$ to a [[real number]] (or similar quantity) $\mu(A)$, the measure of $A$.

A measurable subset $B$ of $X$ is __full__ if, given any measurable set $A$, $\mu(A \cap B) = \mu(A)$; an arbitrary subset of $X$ is __full__ if it\'s a [[superset]] of a full measurable set.  [[de Morgan duality|Dually]], a measurable set $B$ is __null__ if, given any measurable set $A$, $\mu(A \cup B) = \mu(A)$; an arbitrary subset of $X$ is __null__ if it\'s a [[subset]] of a null measurable set.

Some equivalent characterisations ([[constructive mathematics|constructively]] valid for measures on [[Cheng spaces]] except as stated):

*  A measurable set $B$ is null iff $\mu(C) = 0$ for every measurable subset of $B$.
*  If $\mu$ is a [[positive measure]], then a measurable set $B$ is null iff $\mu(B) = 0$.
*  If $\mu$ is a [[finite measure]] with total measure $I$, then a measurable set $B$ is full iff $\mu(C) = I$ for every measurable superset of $B$.
*  If $\mu$ is both positive and finite (so a [[probability measure]] up to rescaling), then a measurable set $B$ is full iff $\mu(B) = I$.
*  Using [[excluded middle]], a set is null iff its complement is full, and a set is full iff its complement is null.  (Even constructively, if a set is null, then its complement is full.)
*  Even constructively, a measurable set is null iff its measurable complement (the complement in the algebraic structure of complemented pairs in a Cheng measurable space) is full, and a measurable set is full iff its measurable complement is null.

## Logic of full/null sets

A property of elements of $X$ (given by a [[subset]] $S$ of $X$) can be considered modulo null sets.  We say that the property $\phi$ is true __almost everywhere__ if it is true on some full set, that is if $\{X | \phi\}$ is full.  Dually, we say that $\phi$ is true __almost nowhere__ if $\{X | \phi\}$ is null.  It is better to use the [[negation]] of 'almost nowhere', although the terminology for this is not really standard; say that $\phi$ is true __somewhere significant__ if $\{X | \phi\}$ is non-null.

Note that being true almost everywhere is a weakening of being true everywhere (given by the [[universal quantifier]] $\forall$), while being true somewhere significant is a strengthening of being true somewhere (given by the [[particular quantifier]] $\exists$).  Indeed we can build a logic out of these.  Use $\ess\forall i, \phi[i]$ or $\ess\forall \phi$ to mean that a [[predicate]] $\phi$ on $X$ is true almost everywhere, and use $\ess\exists i, \phi[i]$ or $\ess\exists \phi$ to mean that $\phi$ is true somewhere significant.  Then we have:
$$\forall \phi \;\Rightarrow\; \ess\forall \phi$$
$$\ess\exists \phi \;\Rightarrow\; \exists \phi$$
$$\ess\forall (\phi \wedge \psi) \;\Leftrightarrow\; \ess\forall \phi \wedge \ess\forall \psi$$
$$\ess\exists (\phi \wedge \psi) \;\Rightarrow\; \ess\exists \phi \wedge \ess\exists \psi$$
$$\ess\forall (\phi \vee \psi) \;\Leftarrow\; \ess\forall \phi \wedge \ess\forall \psi$$
$$\ess\exists (\phi \vee \psi) \;\Leftrightarrow\; \ess\exists \phi \vee \ess\exists \psi$$
$$\ess\forall \neg{\phi} \;\Leftrightarrow\; \neg\ess\exists \phi$$
and other analogues of theorems from [[predicate logic]].  Note that the last item listed requires [[excluded middle]] even though its analogue from ordinary predicate logic does not.

A similar logic is satisfied by '[[eventually]]' and its dual ('frequently') in [[filters]] and [[nets]].
