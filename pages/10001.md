## Idea 

A deformation of [[super Yang-Mills theory]] that yields a [[topological field theory]] in 4 [[dimensions]]. This is in higher dimensional analogy to how the [[topological string]]-[[topological twist|twisting]] of the [[superstring]] yields the topological [[A-model]] and [[B-model]] 2d topological field theories.

### For $N = 4$ supersymmetry

Given [[N=4 D=4 super Yang-Mills theory]], the twisting is induced by a choice of [[subgroup]] inclusion of the [[special orthogonal group]] $SO(4)$ into the [[R-symmetry]] group $SO(6)$. Then choose a [[supersymmetry]] $Q$ which is invariant under the resulting combined action of $SO(4)$ on [[spacetime]] and via [[R-symmetry]] and consider the subspace of [[quantum states]]/[[quantum observables]] which are in the [[kernel]] of $Q$. This subspace defines a [[topological field theory]] which is called the corresponding twisted topological super Yang-Mills theory.

Before the twisting super [[Yang-Mills theory]] depends on the complex [[coupling constant]] 

$$
  \tau = \frac{\theta}{2\pi} + \frac{4 \pi i }{g_{YM}^2}
$$ 

(with $\theta$ the _[[theta angle]]_), after the twisting there is an additional complex parameter $t$ encoding the choice of topological supercharge. The twisted theory however only depends on the combination

$$
  \Psi \coloneqq \frac{\theta}{2 \pi}  + 
  \frac{4 \pi i}{g_{YM}^2} 
  \frac{t - t^{-1}}{t + t^{-1}}
  \,.
$$

([Witten 11, p. 29](#Witten11))

The resulting [[4d TQFT]] is also called the _[[Kapustin-Witten TQFT]]_.

### For $N = 2$ supersymmetry

For [[N=2 D=4 super Yang-Mills theory]] the twisting follows the same idea, but is a little but more intricate ([Witten 11, section 5.1.1](#Witten11))

## Formalization
 {#Formalization}

A formalization of the topological twisting in the framework of [[perturbation theory|perturbative]] [[BV-quantization]] of field theory via [[factorization algebras]] of local [[quantum observables]] is proposed in ([Costello 11, section 15, 16, ...](#Costello11)).

The definition there essentially amounts to saying that a choice of topological twisting is a choice of [[action]] of the [[semidirect product]] [[supergroup]]

$$
  \mathbb{G}_m \ltimes \Pi \mathbb{G}_{ad}
$$

of the [[multiplicative group]] acting on the odd-shifted [[additive group]] via the given [[super Poincare Lie algebra]]. 

We notice that this group is the [automorphism group of the odd line](odd+line#TheAutomorphismSuperGroup)

$$
  \mathbf{Aut}(\mathbb{R}^{0|1}) \simeq \mathbb{G}_m \ltimes \Pi \mathbb{G}_{ad}
$$

for which it is well known that an [[action]] of it is equivalent to a choice of [[differential]] $Q$ and corresponding grading. 

This chosen differential $Q$ among the supersymmetry generators in the [[super Poincare Lie algebra]] is the choice of what in the physics literature is called the twisting "BRST operator".

The twisted theory itself is then defined to be given by the [[factorization algebra]] of observables which is essentially the [[homotopy fixed points]] of this $\mathbf{Aut}(\mathbb{R}^{0|1})$-[[infinity-action]].
