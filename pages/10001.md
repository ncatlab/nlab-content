## Idea 

A deformation of [[super Yang-Mills theory]] that yields a [[topological field theory]] in 4 [[dimensions]]. This is in higher dimensional analogy to how the [[topological string]]-twisting of the [[superstring]] yields the topological [[A-model]] and [[B-model]] 2d topological field theories.

### For $N = 1$ supersymmetry

Given [[N=4 D=4 super Yang-Mills theory]], the twisting is induced by a choice of [[subgroup]] inclusion of the [[special orthogonal group]] $SO(4)$ into the [[R-symmetry]] group $SO(6)$. Then choose a [[supersymmetry]] $Q$ which is invariant under the resulting combined action of $SO(4)$ on [[spacetime]] and via [[R-symmetry]] and consider the subspace of [[quantum states]]/[[quantum observables]] which are in the [[kernel]] of $Q$. This subspace defines a [[topological field theory]] which is called the corresponding twisted topological super Yang-Mills theory.

Before the twisting super [[Yang-Mills theory]] depends on the complex [[coupling constant]] 

$$
  \tau = \frac{\theta}{2\pi} + \frac{4 \pi i }{g_{YM}^2}
$$ 

(with $\theta$ the _[[theta angle]]_), after the twisting there is an additional complex parameter $t$ encoding the choice of topological supercharge. The twisted theory however only depends on the combination

$$
  \Psi \coloneqq \frac{\theta}{2 \pi}  + 
  \frac{4 \pi i}{g_{YM}^2} 
  \frac{t - t^{-1}}{t + t^{-1}}
  \,.
$$

### For $N = 2$ supersymmetry

For [[N=2 D=4 super Yang-Mills theory]] the twisting follows the same idea, but is a little but more intricate ([Witten 11, section 5.1.1](#Witten11))
