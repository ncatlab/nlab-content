## Idea

For every [[Lawvere theory]] $T$ containing the theory of [[abelian group]]s [[Isbell duality|Isbell dual]] [[sheaf topos]] over formal duals of $T$-algebras contains a canonical [[line object]] $\mathbb{A}^1$.

For $T$ the theory of commutative [[ring]]s this is called the _affine line_ .


## Definition

### Affine line

Let $k$ be a [[ring]], and $T$ the [[Lawvere theory]] of [[associative algebra]]s over $k$, such that the category of [[algebras over a Lawvere theory]] $T Alg = Alg_k$ is the [[category]] of $k$-algebras. 

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

The canonical $T$-[[line object]] is the **affine line**

$$
  \mathbb{A}_k := Spec(F_T(*))  = Spec k[t]
  \,.
$$

=--

Here the [[free functor|free]] $T$-algebra on a single generator $F_T(*)$ is the [[polynomial algebra]] $k[t] \in Alg_k$ on a single generator $* = t$ and $Spec k[t]$ may be regarded as the corresponding object in the [[opposite category]] $Aff_k := Alg_k^{op}$ of [[affine scheme]]s over $Spec  k$.


### Multiplicative group

The multiplicative [[group object]] in $Ring^{op}$ corresponding to the affine line -- usually just called the **multiplicative group** is the [[group scheme]] denoted $\mathbb{G}_m$

* whose underlying affine scheme is

  $$
    (\mathbb{A}^1 - \{0\}) := Spec k[t,t^{-1}]
    \,,
  $$

  where $k[t,t^{-1}]$ is the [[localization]] of the ring $k[t]$ at the element $t = (t-0)$.

* whose multiplication operation

  $$
    \cdot \mathbb{G}_m \times \mathbb{G}_m \to \mathbb{G}_m
  $$

  is the morphism in $Ring^{op}$ corresponding to the morphism in [[Ring]]

  $$
    k[t_1,t_1^{-1}] \otimes_k k[t_2, t_2^{-1}] \leftarrow k[t,t^{-1}]
  $$

  given by $t \mapsto t_1 \cdot t_2$;

* whose unit map $Spec k \to Spec k[t,t^{-1}]$ is given by

  $$
    t \mapsto 1
  $$

* and whose inversion map $Spec k[t,t^{-1}] \to Spec[t,t^{-1}]$ is given by

  $$
    t \mapsto t^{-1}
    \,.
  $$

### Additive group

The additive [[group object]] in $Ring^{op}$ corresponding to the affine line -- usually just called the **additive group** is the [[group scheme]] denoted $\mathbb{G}_a$  

* whose underlying object is $\mathbb{A}^1$ itself;

* whose addition operation $\mathbb{G}_a \times \mathbb{G}_a \to \mathbb{G}_a$ is dually the ring homomorphism 

  $$
    k[t_1] \otimes_k k[t_2] \leftarrow k[t]
  $$

  given by

  $$
    t \mapsto t_1 + t_2
    \,;
  $$

* whose unit map is given by

  $$
    t \mapsto 0
    \,;
  $$

* whose inversion map is given by

  $$
    t \mapsto -t
    \,.
  $$

###### Proposition

Let $R$ be a commutative $k$-algebra. There is a [[natural isomorphism]] between

* $\mathbb{Z}$-[[graded algebra|gradings]] on $R$;

* $\mathbb{G}_m$-[[action]]s on $Spec R$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


For the first direction, let $R$ be a $\mathbb{Z}$-[[graded algebra|graded commutative algebra]]. Then $X = Spec R$ comes with a $\mathbb{G}$-action given as follows: the action morphism

$$
 \rho :  X \times \mathbb{G}_m \to X
$$

is dually the ring homomorphism

$$
  R \otimes_k \mathbb{Z}[t,t^{-1}] \leftarrow R
$$

defined on homogeneous elements $r$ of degree $n$ by

$$
  r \mapsto r \cdot t^n
  \,.
$$

The action property

$$
  \array{
     X \times \mathbb{G}_m \times \mathbb{G}_m &\stackrel{Id \times \cdot}{\to}& X \times \mathbb{G}
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\rho} \times Id}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\rho}}
     \\
     X \times \mathbb{G}_m &\stackrel{\rho}{\to}& X
  }
$$

is equivalently the equation

$$
  r (t_1)^n \cdot (t_2)^n = r (t_1 \cdot t_2)^n
$$

for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}$. Similarly the [[unitality]] of the action is the equation

$$
  (1)^n = 1
  \,.
$$

Conversely, given an action of $\mathbb{G}_m$ on $Spec R$ we have some morphism

$$
  R[t,t^{-1}] \leftarrow R
$$

that sends

$$
  r \mapsto \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} r_n t^n
  \,.
$$


By the action property we have that 

$$
  \sum_n r_n (t_1 t_2)^n = \sum_{n,k} (r_n)_k t_1^n t_2^k
  \,.
$$

Hence 

$$
  (r_n)_k = 
  \left\{
    \array{
       r_n & if \; n = k
       \\
       0 & otherwise
    }
  \right.
$$

and so the morphism gives a decomposition of $R$ into pieces labeled by $\mathbb{Z}$.

###### Remark

This induces the algebraic construction of [[projective space]]s as formal duals of graded algebras. See there for more details.
