## Idea

For every [[Lawvere theory]] $T$ containing the theory of [[abelian group]]s [[Isbell duality|Isbell dual]] [[sheaf topos]] over formal duals of $T$-algebras contains a canonical [[line object]] $\mathbb{A}^1$.

For $T$ the theory of commutative [[ring]]s this is called the _affine line_ .


## Definition

### Affine line

Let $k$ be a [[ring]], and $T$ the [[Lawvere theory]] of [[associative algebra]]s over $k$, such that the category of [[algebras over a Lawvere theory]] $T Alg = Alg_k$ is the [[category]] of $k$-algebras. 

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

The canonical $T$-[[line object]] is the **affine line**

$$
  \mathbb{A}_k := Spec(F_T(*))  = Spec k[t]
  \,.
$$

=--

Here the [[free functor|free]] $T$-algebra on a single generator $F_T(*)$ is the [[polynomial algebra]] $k[t] \in Alg_k$ on a single generator $* = t$ and $Spec k[t]$ may be regarded as the corresponding object in the [[opposite category]] $Aff_k := Alg_k^{op}$ of [[affine scheme]]s over $Spec  k$.


### Multiplicative group
 {#MultiplicativeGroup}

The [[multiplicative group]] object in $Ring^{op}$ corresponding to the affine line -- usually just called the **multiplicative group** -- is the [[group scheme]] denoted $\mathbb{G}_m$

* whose underlying affine scheme is

  $$
    (\mathbb{A}^1 - \{0\}) := Spec \left(k[t,t^{-1}]\right)
    \,,
  $$

  where $k[t,t^{-1}]$ is the [[localization]] of the ring $k[t]$ at the element $t = (t-0)$.

* whose multiplication operation

  $$
    \cdot \mathbb{G}_m \times \mathbb{G}_m \to \mathbb{G}_m
  $$

  is the morphism in $Ring^{op}$ corresponding to the morphism in [[Ring]]

  $$
    k[t_1,t_1^{-1}] \otimes_k k[t_2, t_2^{-1}] \leftarrow k[t,t^{-1}]
  $$

  given by $t \mapsto t_1 \cdot t_2$;

* whose unit map $Spec k \to Spec k[t,t^{-1}]$ is given by

  $$
    t \mapsto 1
  $$

* and whose inversion map $Spec k[t,t^{-1}] \to Spec[t,t^{-1}]$ is given by

  $$
    t \mapsto t^{-1}
    \,.
  $$

Therefore for $R$ any [[ring]] a morphism

$$
  Spec R \longrightarrow \mathbb{G}_m
$$

is equivalently a ring homomorphism

$$
  R \leftarrow k[t,t^{-1}]
$$

which is equivalently a choice of multiplicatively invertible element in $R$. Therefore

$$
  Hom(Spec R , \mathbb{G}_m) \simeq R^\times = GL_1(R)
$$

is the [[group of units]] of $R$.

### Additive group
 {#AdditiveGroup}

The [[additive group]] in $Ring^{op}$ corresponding to the affine line -- usually just called the **additive group** -- is the [[group scheme]] denoted $\mathbb{G}_a$  

* whose underlying object is $\mathbb{A}^1$ itself;

* whose addition operation $\mathbb{G}_a \times \mathbb{G}_a \to \mathbb{G}_a$ is dually the ring homomorphism 

  $$
    k[t_1] \otimes_k k[t_2] \leftarrow k[t]
  $$

  given by

  $$
    t \mapsto t_1 + t_2
    \,;
  $$

* whose unit map is given by

  $$
    t \mapsto 0
    \,;
  $$

* whose inversion map is given by

  $$
    t \mapsto -t
    \,.
  $$

### Group of roots of unity

The group of $n$th [[roots of unity]] is

$$
  \mu_n = Spec(k[t](t^n -1))
  \,.
$$

This sits inside the [[multiplicative group]] via the [[Kummer sequence]]

$$
  \mu_n \longrightarrow \mathbb{G}_m \stackrel{(-)^n}{\longrightarrow}\mathbb{G}_m
 \,.
$$

###### Proposition

Let $R$ be a commutative $k$-algebra. There is a [[natural isomorphism]] between

* $\mathbb{Z}$-[[graded algebra|gradings]] on $R$;

* $\mathbb{G}_m$-[[action]]s on $Spec R$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


For the first direction, let $R$ be a $\mathbb{Z}$-[[graded algebra|graded commutative algebra]]. Then $X = Spec R$ comes with a $\mathbb{G}$-action given as follows: the action morphism

$$
 \rho :  X \times \mathbb{G}_m \to X
$$

is dually the ring homomorphism

$$
  R \otimes_k \mathbb{Z}[t,t^{-1}] \leftarrow R
$$

defined on homogeneous elements $r$ of degree $n$ by

$$
  r \mapsto r \cdot t^n
  \,.
$$

The action property

$$
  \array{
     X \times \mathbb{G}_m \times \mathbb{G}_m &\stackrel{Id \times \cdot}{\to}& X \times \mathbb{G}
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\rho} \times Id}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\rho}}
     \\
     X \times \mathbb{G}_m &\stackrel{\rho}{\to}& X
  }
$$

is equivalently the equation

$$
  r (t_1)^n \cdot (t_2)^n = r (t_1 \cdot t_2)^n
$$

for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}$. Similarly the [[unitality]] of the action is the equation

$$
  (1)^n = 1
  \,.
$$

Conversely, given an action of $\mathbb{G}_m$ on $Spec R$ we have some morphism

$$
  R[t,t^{-1}] \leftarrow R
$$

that sends

$$
  r \mapsto \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} r_n t^n
  \,.
$$


By the action property we have that 

$$
  \sum_n r_n (t_1 t_2)^n = \sum_{n,k} (r_n)_k t_1^n t_2^k
  \,.
$$

Hence 

$$
  (r_n)_k = 
  \left\{
    \array{
       r_n & if \; n = k
       \\
       0 & otherwise
    }
  \right.
$$

and so the morphism gives a decomposition of $R$ into pieces labeled by $\mathbb{Z}$.

One sees that these two constructions are [[inverse]] to each other.

=--


## Examples

### Projective space

The [[diagonal]] [[action]] of the multiplicative group on the [[product]] $\mathbb{A}^n := \prod_{i = 1 \cdots n} \mathbb{A}^1$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ 

$$
  \mathbb{A}^n \times \mathbb{G}_m \to \mathbb{A}^n
$$

is dually the morphism

$$
  k[t, t_1, \cdots, t_n] \leftarrow k[t_1, \cdots, t_n]
$$

given by

$$
  t_i \mapsto t \cdot t_i
  \,.
$$

This makes $k[t,\{t_i\}]$ the free [[graded algebra]] over $k$ on $n$ generators $t_i$ in degree 1. This in $\mathbb{N} \subset \mathbb{Z}$-graded. What is genuinely $\mathbb{Z}$-graded is 

$$
  \mathcal{O} (\mathbb{A}^n - \{0\}) \simeq k[t_1, t_1^{-1}, \cdots, t_n, t_n^{-1}]
  \,.
$$

The quotient by the multiplicative group action

$$
  \mathbb{A} P^n_k := (\mathbb{A}^{n+1} - \{0\})/\mathbb{G}_m
$$

is the [[projective space]] over $k$ of [[dimension]] $n$.

### $\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy theory

In [[A1-homotopy theory|A^1 homotopy theory]] one considers the [[reflective sub-(∞,1)-category|reflective]] [[localization of an (∞,1)-category|localizatoin]]

$$
  Sh_\infty(C)_{\mathbb{A}^1}
  \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\hookrightarrow}
  Sh_\infty(C)
$$

of the [[(∞,1)-topos]] of [[(∞,1)-sheaves]] over a [[site]] $C$ such as the [[Nisnevich site]], at the morphisms of the form

$$
  p_1 : X \times \mathbb{A}^1 \to X
$$

that contract away cartesian factors of the affine line.
