## KAZAMA SUZUKI MODELS ##

Kazama Suzuki models are a generalized version of Gepner construction. Instead of trivial tensoring of minimal models, it predicts a whole class of SCFT build with a Superconformal coset method to yield a C=9, as needed for internal consistency of Superstring compactification.

The method involves  generalized form of N=1 SCFT Supercurrent to yield OPEs of N=2 SCFT. This way, a whole new class of N=2 SCFTs are constructed leading to a much interesting classification based on Hermitian Symmetric spaces.
