[[!redirects n-localic (∞,1)-topos]]


The generalizatoin of the notion of [[localic topos]]
to the context of [[(∞,1)-topos]]es.

recall from somewhere that for $X$ an [[(infinity,1)-topos]]
the symbols $\tau_{n-1} X$ denote the essential image of the truncation
functor $\tau_{n-1} : X \to X$. Recall from the warning remark
6.4.5.10 and the discussion above it that this should really be thought of
as $\tau_n X$ if we think of $X$ as a [[topological space]].

Definition (n-localic $(\infinity,1)$-topos)

def 6.4.5.8 in [[Higher Topos Theory]]

For $X,Y$ $(\infty,1)$-toposes, 
let $Geom(X,Y) \subset Fun(X,Y)$ denote the subcategory of the [[(infinity,1)-category of (infinity,1)-functors]] $X \to Y$
that are [[geometric morphism]]s of $(\infty,1)$-toposes.

An [[(infinity,1)-topos]] $X$ is $n$-localic if for any other
$(\infty,1)$-topos $Y$ the canonical map

$$
  Geom(X,Y) \to Geom(\tau_{n-1}X, \tau_{n-1}Y)
$$

is an equivalence.
