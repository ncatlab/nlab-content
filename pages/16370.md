## Idea

The concept of a **closed subtopos** generalizes the concept of a closed subspace from topology to toposes.

## Definition

Let $U$ be a [[subterminal object]] of a [[topos]] $\mathcal{E}$.  Then $c_U(V) \coloneqq U\cup V$ defines a [[Lawvere-Tierney topology]] on $\mathcal{E}$, whose corresponding [[subtopos]] is called the _closed subtopos_ associated to $U$.

The reflector into the sheaves can be constructed explicitly as the [[join]] with $U$, i.e. $C_U(X)$ is the [[pushout]] of $X$ and $U$ under $X\times U$.

A _topology_ $j$ that is of this form for some [[subterminal object]] $U$ is called _closed_.

## Example

In case $\mathcal{E}=Sh(X)$ is the topos of sheaves on a topological space $X$, a subterminal object is just an open subset $U$ of $X$ and the closed subtopos corresponding to it is equivalent to $Sh(X\setminus U)$.

## Remark

The [[subterminal object]] $U$ in $\mathcal{E}$ is associated with an [[open subtopos]] $Sh_{o(U)}(\mathcal{E})$ as well e.g. in the case of $\mathcal{E}=Sh(X)$ on a space $X$ this yields $Sh(U)$.

Moreover, given a [[Lawvere-Tierney topology]] $j$ on a topos $\mathcal{E}$ with corresponding subtopos $Sh_j(\mathcal{E})\hookrightarrow\mathcal{E}$, we a get a canonical [[subterminal object]] $ext(j)$  associated to $j$ by taking the $j$-closure of $O\rightarrowtail 1$. The corresponding closed and open subtoposes associated to $ext(j)$ provide a '_closure_' $Sh_j(\mathcal{E})\hookrightarrow Sh_{c(ext(j))}(\mathcal{E})$, called _l'adhérence_ in ([[SGA4]], p.461), respectively, an '_exterior_' $Sh_{o(ext(j))}(\mathcal{E})$ for $Sh_j(\mathcal{E})$.

###### Proposition
Let $U$ a [[subterminal object]] and $Sh_{c(U)}(\mathcal{E})$ and $Sh_{o(U)}(\mathcal{E})$ the corresponding closed, resp. open subtoposes. Then $Sh_{c(U)}(\mathcal{E})$ and $Sh_{o(U)}(\mathcal{E})$ are [[complement|complements]] for each other in the [[lattice of subtoposes]].

For the proof see ([Johnstone (2002)](#Johnstone), pp.212,215).

Closed subtoposes that are [[Boolean topos|Boolean]] are parametrized by automorphisms of the [[subobject classifier]] as the next proposition documents:

###### Proposition

Let $\mathcal{E}$ be a topos. Then automorphisms of $\Omega$ correspond bijectively to closed Boolean subtoposes. The group operation on $Aut(\Omega)$ corresponds to symmetric difference of subtoposes.
