## Definition

###### Definition

For $R$ a [[ring]], a _projective $R$-module_ is a [[projective object]] in the [[category]] $R$[[Mod]].

## Properties





### Equivalent characterizations

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

A module $N$ is projective precisely if the [[hom functor]] 

$$
  Hom_{R Mod}(N, - ) : R Mod \to Ab
$$

out of it is an [[exact functor]]. 

=--

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

An $R$-module $N$ is projective precisely if it is the [[direct summand]] of a [[free module]]. 

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Clearly if $N$ is a direct summand then it is projective. We show the converse.

Let $F(U(N))$ be the [[free module]] on the [[set]] $U(N)$ underlying $N$. The [[counit of an adjunction|counit]] 

$$
  \epsilon : F(U(N)) \to N
$$

of the [[free functor|free]]/[[forgetful functor|forgetful]]-[[adjunction]] $(F \dashv U)$ is an [[epimorphism]]. Thefore if $N$ is projective, there is a [[section]] $s$ of $\epsilon$. This exhibits $N$ as a direct summand of $F(U(N))$.

### Relation to projective resolutions of chain complexes
 {#RelationToProjectiveResolution}


+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For $N \in R Mod$ a **[[projective resolution]]** of $N$ is a [[chain complex]] $(Q N)_\bullet \in Ch_\bullet(R Mod)$ equipped with a [[chain map]]

$$
  Q N \to N
$$

(with $N$ regarded as a complex concentrated in degree 0) such that

1. this morphism is a [[quasi-isomorphism]] (this is what makes it a [[resolution]]), which is equivalent to 

   $$ \cdots \to (Q N)_1 \to (Q N)_0 \to N $$

   being an [[exact sequence]];

1.  all whose entries $(Q N)_n$ are projective modules.


=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

This means precisely that $Q N \to N$ is an [[injective resolution]] with respect to the standard [[model structure on chain complexes]] (see [here](model%20structure%20on%20chain%20complexes#StandardQuillenOnBounded)) for which the fibrations are the positive-degreewise epimorphisms. Notice that in this model structure every object is fibrant, so that cofibrant resolutions are the only resolutions that need to be considered.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Every $R$-module has a projective resolution. 

=--

This means that $R$[[Mod]] is said to have **[[projective object|enough projectives]]** if for every module $N$ there is a projective module $P$ and an [[epimorphism]] $P \to N$.



## Examples

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition


If $R$ is the [[integers]] $\mathbb{Z}$, or a [[field]] $k$, or a [[division ring]], then every projective $R$-module is already a free $R$-module.
