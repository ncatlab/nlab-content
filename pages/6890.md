## Idea

The computer software _Coq_ is a formal [[proof]] management system. It provides a formal language to write mathematical [[definition]]s, executable [[algorithm]]s and [[theorem]]s together with an environment for semi-interactive development of machine-checked [[proof]]s. 

Coq is named after [[Thierry Coquand]], and follows a tradition of naming languages after animals (compare OCaml).

## Applications

Computer systems such as Coq and [[Agda]] have been used to give machine-assisted and machine-verified proofs of extraordinary length, such as of the [[four-colour theorem]] and the [[Kepler conjecture]]. 

More generally, they are being used to formalise and machine-verify large parts of mathematics as such, see the section

* [Formalization of set-based mathematics](#FormalizationOfSetBasedMathematics)

below. 

One striking insight by [[Vladimir Voevodsky]] was that Coq naturally lends itself also to a formalization of higher mathematics that is founded not on sets, but on [[higher category theory]] and [[homotopy theory]]. For this see below the section

* [Homotopy type theory](#HomotopyTypeTheory).

To start it, scroll down to "Proof assistants on the web", choose "Coq" from the menu "proof assistant" and Click on "guest login". In the user interface that appears, enter Coq-code in the left window and hit the arrow-buttons to "run" it with output appearing in the right window. The guest account allows everything except saving files.
