## Idea

A [[Witt vector]] is an infinite sequence of elements of a commutative ring $k$. There is a unique ring structure on the set $W(k)$ of Witt vectors of $k$ and $W(k)$ is therefore called *the Witt ring of $k$*. The multiplication is defined by means of [[Witt polynomials]] $w_i$ for every natural number $i$. If the characteristic of $k$ is $0$ the Witt ring of $k$ is sometimes called *universal Witt ring* to distinguish it from the case where $k$ is of prime characteristic and a similar but different construction is of interest.

A [[Witt vector|p-adic Witt vector]] is an infinite sequence of elements af a commutative ring of pime [[characteristic]] $p$. There exists a ring structure whose construction parallels that in characteristic $0$ except that only [[Witt polynomials]]  $w_{p^l}$ whose index is a power of $p$ are taken.

A Witt ring is in particular a [[Lambda-ring]] and the assignation $W:k\to W(k)$ of a commutative ring to its Witt ring is a [[functor]] which has a left adjoint ''forgetting the $\lambda$-structure''. More over $W$ is representable by the  [[symmetric function|Symm]], the ring of symmetric functions and consequently $W$ is a [[group scheme]]. This is explained at [[Lamda-ring]].

## Definition

###### Definition and Theorem
Let $k$ be a commutaive ring.

If the characteristic of $k$ is $0$ then the Witt ring $W(k)$ of $k$ is defined defined by the addition

$$(a_1, a_2, \ldots, )+(b_1, b_2, \ldots) :=(\Sigma_1(a_1,b_1), \Sigma_2(a_1,a_2,b_1,b_2), \ldots)$$

and the multiplication


$$(a_1, a_2, \ldots )\cdot (b_1, b_2, \ldots ) :=(\Pi_1(a_1,b_1), \Pi_2(a_1,a_2,b_1,b_2), \ldots )$$

If $k$ is of prime characteristic $p$ we index the defining formulas by $p^1,p^2,p^3,\dots$ instead of $1,2,3,\dots$.

Here the $\Sigma_i$ (described below) are called *addition polynomials* and the $\Pi_i$ (described below) are called *multiplication polynomials*

The assignation $W:k\to W(k)$ is a functor. This functor is the unique endofunctor $W:CRin\to CRing$ such that all Witt polynomials

$$w_n:\begin{cases}
W(A)\to A
\\
a\mapsto w_n(a)
\end{cases}$$

are morphisms of rings. In fact this unicity indicates that $W$ has a left adjoint.

### The Witt polynomials{#Witt polynomials}, the $\Sigma_i$, the $\Pi_i$, phantom components

let $x_1, x_2, \ldots $ be a collection of [[indeterminate]]s. We can define an infinite collection of [[polynomial]]s in $\mathbb{Z}[x_1, x_2, \ldots ]$ using the following formulas:

$w_1(X)=x_1$

$w_2(X)=x_1^2+2x_2$

$w_3(X)=x_1^3+3x_3$

$w_4(X)=x_1^4+2x_2^2+4x_4$

and in general $\displaystyle w_n(X)=\sum_{d|n} dx_n^{n/d}$. The value $w_n(w)$ of the $n$-th Witt polynomial in some element $w\in W(k)$ of the Witt ring of $k$ is sometimes called the *$n$-th phantom component of $w$*.


Now let $\phi(z_1, z_2)\in\mathbb{Z}[z_1, z_2]$. This just an arbitrary two variable polynomial with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}$. 

We can define new polynomials $\Phi_i(x_1, \ldots x_i, y_1, \ldots y_i)$ such that the following condition is met $\phi(w_n(x_1, \ldots ,x_n), w_n(y_1, \ldots , y_n))=w_n(\Phi_1(x_1, y_1), \ldots , \Phi_n(x_1, \ldots x_n, y_1, \ldots , y_n))$.

In short we'll notate this $\phi(w_n(X),w_n(Y))=w_n(\Phi(X,Y))$. The first thing we need to do is make sure that such polynomials exist. Now it isn't hard to check that the $x_i$ can be written as a $\mathbb{Q}$-linear combination of the $w_n$ just by some linear algebra.

$x_1=w_1$, and $x_2=\frac{1}{2}w_2+\frac{1}{2}w_1^2$, etc. so we can plug these in to get the existence of such polynomials with coefficients in $\mathbb{Q}$. It is a fairly tedious lemma to prove that the coefficients $\Phi_i$ are actually in $\mathbb{Z}$, so we won't detract from the construction right now to prove it.

#### The addition- and multiplication polynomials

Define yet another set of polynomials $\Sigma_i$, $\Pi_i$ and $\iota_i$ by the following properties:

$w_n(\Sigma)=w_n(X)+w_n(Y)$, $w_n(\Pi)=w_n(X)w_n(Y)$ and $w_n(\iota)=-w_n(X)$.

We now can construct $W(A)$, the ring of generalized Witt vectors over $A$. Define $W(A)$ to be the set of all infinite sequences $(a_1, a_2, \ldots)$ with entries in $A$. Then we define addition and multiplication by $(a_1, a_2, \ldots, )+(b_1, b_2, \ldots)=(\Sigma_1(a_1,b_1), \Sigma_2(a_1,a_2,b_1,b_2), \ldots)$ and $(a_1, a_2, \ldots )\cdot (b_1, b_2, \ldots )=(\Pi_1(a_1,b_1), \Pi_2(a_1,a_2,b_1,b_2), \ldots )$.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof of the theorem

There is a nice trick to prove that $W(A)$ is a ring when $A$ is a $\mathbb{Q}$-algebra. Just define $\psi: W(A)\to A^\mathbb{N}$ by $(a_1, a_2, \ldots) \mapsto (w_1(a), w_2(a), \ldots)$. This is a [[bijection]] and the addition and multiplication is taken to component-wise addition and multiplication, so since this is the standard ring structure we know $W(A)$ is a ring. Also, $w(0,0,\ldots)=(0,0,\ldots)$, so $(0,0,\ldots)$ is the additive identity, $W(1,0,0,\ldots)=(1,1,1,\ldots)$ which shows $(1,0,0,\ldots)$ is the multiplicative identity, and $w(\iota_1(a), \iota_2(a), \ldots)=(-a_1, -a_2, \ldots)$, so we see $(\iota_1(a), \iota_2(a), \ldots)$ is the additive inverse.

We can actually get this idea to work for any characteristic $0$ ring by considering the embedding $A\to A\otimes\mathbb{Q}$. We have an induced injective map $W(A)\to W(A\otimes\mathbb{Q})$. The addition and multiplication is defined by polynomials over $\mathbb{Z}$, so these operations are preserved upon tensoring with $\mathbb{Q}$. We just proved above that $W(A\otimes\mathbb{Q})$ is a ring, so since $(0,0,\ldots)\mapsto (0,0,\ldots)$ and $(1,0,0,\ldots)\mapsto (1,0,0,\ldots)$ and the map preserves inverses we get that the image of the embedding $W(A)\to W(A\otimes \mathbb{Q})$ is a subring and hence $W(A)$ is a ring.

Lastly, we need to prove this for positive [[characteristic]] rings. Choose a characteristic $0$ ring that surjects onto $A$, say $B\to A$. Then since the induced map again preserves everything and $W(B)\to W(A)$ is [[surjective]], the image is a ring and hence $W(A)$ is a ring.

## Operations on the p-adic Witt vectors

On untruncated $p$-adic Witt vectors there are two operations, the [[Frobenius morphism]] and the [[Verschiebung morphism]] satisfying relations ([Lemma 1](#FVrelations) being constitutive for the definition of the [[Dieudonné ring]]: In fact the Dieudonné ring is generated by two objects satisfying these relations.

Also the $n$-truncations of a Witt ring are rings since by definition the ring operations (addition and multiplication) of the first $n$ components only involve the first $n$ components. We have $W\simeq lim_n W_n$ and the projection map $W(A)\to W_n(A)$ is a [[ring homomorphism]]. We also have operations on the truncated Witt rings.

### The shift map

For $W(k)$ as for every $k$-scheme we have the [[Verschiebung morphism]]. It  is defined to be the adjoint operation to the [[Frobenius morphism]]. For $W(k)$ the Verschiebung morphism coincides with the shift $(a_0, a_1,\dots)\mapsto (0, a_0, a_1,\dots)$

For the truncated Witt rings and the shift operation $V:W_n(k)\to W_{n+1}(k)$ the Verschiebung morphism equals the $VR=RV$ where $R$ is the restriction map.

### The restriction map

The restriction map $R: W_{n+1}(A)\to W_n(A)$ is given by $(a_0, \ldots, a_n)\mapsto (a_0, \ldots, a_{n-1})$. 

### The Frobenius morphism

The Frobenius endomorphism $F: W_n(A)\to W_n(A)$ is given by $(a_0, \ldots , a_{n-1})\mapsto (a_0^p, \ldots, a_{n-1}^p)$. This is also a ring map, but only because of our necessary assumption that $A$ is of characteristic $p$.

Just by brute force checking on elements we see a few relations between these operations, namely that $V(x)y=V(x F(R(y)))$ and $RVF=FRV=RFV=p$ the multiplication by $p$ map.

## Ring Properties

###### Theorem

Suppose that $k$ is a perfect field of positive characteristic $p$, then $W(k)$ is a discrete valuation ring with maximal ideal generated by $p$. From the above we see that $pW(k)=(0, a_0^p, a_1^p, \ldots )$. This clearly gives $W(k)/pW(k)\simeq k$. 

Also, $W(k)/p^nW(k)\simeq W_n(k)$. Thus the completion of $W(k)$ with respect to the maximal ideal is just $lim W_n(k)\simeq W(k)$ which shows that $W(k)$ is a complete discrete valuation ring.
