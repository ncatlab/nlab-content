## Idea

The **dense topology** is a [[Grothendieck topology]] on a small category $\mathcal{C}$ whose [[sieves]] generalize the idea of a 'downward dense' [[poset]]. The dense topology is important for sheaf-theoretic approaches to [[forcing]].

There is also a closely related but more general concept of a _dense_ [[Lawvere-Tierney topology]] which is discussed at [[dense subtopos]].

## Definition

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category. The _dense topology_ $J_d$ is the [[Grothendieck topology]] with collections of [[sieves]] $J_d(Y)$ of the form:

A sieve $S$ is in $J_d(Y)$ iff for all $f:X\to Y$ there exists a $g:Z\to X$ such that $f\circ g:Z\to Y$ is in $S$.

## Properties

Recall that a category $\mathcal{C}$ satisfies the [[Ore condition]] if every diagram $X\rightarrow W\leftarrow Y$ can be completed to a commutative square. When this happens, the dense topology has a simpler description as the collection of all nonempty sieves and is called the [[atomic site|atomic topology]] $J_{at}$ on $\mathcal{C}$:

###### Proposition
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[category]] satisfying the [[Ore condition]]. Then the dense topology $J_d$ coincides with the atomic topology $J_{at}$.

###### Proposition
For every small category $\mathcal{C}$, the [[Lawvere-Tierney topology]] on the [[presheaf topos]] $Set^{\mathcal{C}^{op}}$ corresponding to the dense topology on $\mathcal{C}$ is the [[double negation|double negation topology]] $\neg\neg$ on $Set^{\mathcal{C}^{op}}$.

This appears as ([MacLaneMoerdijk, corollary VI 5](#MacLaneMoerdijk)).

In particular, the [[Lawvere-Tierney topology]] corresponding to the dense topology is [[dense subtopos|dense as a Lawvere-Tierney topology]]!
