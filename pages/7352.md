## Idea

The term **quiver variety** refers to a number of [[algebraic varieties]] constructed as [[moduli spaces]] of [[quiver representations]].  

The most important are the _Nakajima quiver varieties_ ([Nakajima 98](#Nakajima98)), which give the moduli of stable representations of [[preprojective algebras]].
These are notable for allowing a geometrical construction of the [[universal enveloping algebra]] of [[Kac-Moody algebras]] [[action|acting]] on the cohomology of quiver varieties and related spaces.
