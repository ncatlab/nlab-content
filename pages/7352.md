The term **quiver variety** refers to a number of varieties constructed as moduli spaces of representations of quivers.  The most important are the Nakajima quiver varieties, which moduli of stable representations of [[preprojective algebras]], introduced by [[Hiraku Nakajima]] in

These are notable for allowing a geometrical construction of the universal enveloping algebra of Kac-Moody algebras acting on the cohomology of quiver varieties and related spaces.
