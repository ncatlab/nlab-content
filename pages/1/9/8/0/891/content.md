The **quotient object** $Q$ of a [[congruence]] (an [[internalization|internal]] [[equivalence relation]]) $E$ on an object $X$ in a category $C$ is simply the [[coequalizer]] $Q$ of the induced pair of maps $E \to X$.  If $E$ is the [[kernel pair]] of the map $X \to Q$, then $Q$ is called an **effective quotient** (and $E$ is called an **effective** congruence).

Sometimes the term is used more loosely to mean a co-[[subobject]] of $X$, that is a subobject of $X$ in the [[opposite category]] $C^\op$, without reference to any congruence on $X$.
