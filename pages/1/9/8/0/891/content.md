The **quotient object** $Q$ of a [[congruence]] (an [[internalization|internal]] [[equivalence relation]]) $E$ on an object $X$ in a category $C$ is simply the [[coequalizer]] $Q$ of the induced pair of maps $E \to X$.  If $E$ is the [[kernel pair]] of the map $X \to Q$, then $Q$ is called an **effective quotient** (and $E$ is called an **effective** congruence).

Sometimes the term is used more loosely to mean a co-[[subobject]] of $X$, that is a subobject of $X$ in the [[opposite category]] $C^\op$, without reference to any congruence on $X$.

[[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: To respond to your earlier, deleted comment, I don't think it's silly to use "quotient" to mean "cosubobject" any more than it's silly to use "epimorphism" to mean "comonomorphism."  I think I would prefer using "a quotient" to mean "a cosubobject" (with meaning varying along the "extremal, strong, regular, etc." axis), but also allowing "quotient of blah" for any coequalizer, not necessarily of an equivalence relation.  Only in a good enough category (like a regular one) does every parallel pair generate an equivalence relation, but I think such coequalizers still merit the name "quotient."

I think the reason I included effective quotients was because I'd noticed several pages saying that an exact category is a regular category where all equivalence relations have quotients, and this is only true if by "quotient" you mean "effective quotient."  However, possibly I should just have changed those pages to say "effective quotient."
