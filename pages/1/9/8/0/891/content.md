A **quotient object** in a [[category]] can have a number of slightly different meanings.

1. A quotient in $C$ can mean just a [[subobject]] in $C^{op}$.  That is a quotient of an object $c$ is an isomorphism class of (perhaps strong, extremal, or regular) [[epimorphism]]s with domain $c$.
1. A quotient can also mean the [[coequalizer]] of an ([[internalization|internal]]) [[equivalence relation]], or more generally any coequalizer (that is, any [[regular epimorphism]]) at all.
1. In the context of an [[exact category]], the quotient of an equivalence relation $R$ is not just a coequalizer of it, but a coequalizer with the additional property that $R$ is the [[kernel pair|kernel]] of the quotient.  There exist [[regular category|regular]] categories which have all coequalizers, but do not have all quotients in this sense.
