A **quotient object** in a [[category]] can have a number of slightly different meanings.

1. A quotient in $C$ can mean just a [[subobject]] in $C^{op}$.  That is a quotient of an object $c$ is an isomorphism class of (perhaps strong, extremal, or regular) [[epimorphism]]s with domain $c$.
1. A quotient can also mean the [[coequalizer]] of an ([[internalization|internal]]) [[equivalence relation]], or more generally any coequalizer (that is, any [[regular epimorphism]]) at all.
1. In the context of an [[exact category]], the quotient of an equivalence relation $R$ is not just a coequalizer of it, but a coequalizer with the additional property that $R$ is the [[kernel pair|kernel]] of the quotient.  There exist [[regular category|regular]] categories which have all coequalizers, but do not have all quotients in this sense.

Should we at least play Bourbaki for our own purposes here?  (1) is silly when you have 'cosubobject', and none of the links here (except the rather off-hand comment in [[image]]) mean that.  If I\'m not mixed up, (3) is distinguished by the adjective 'effective', or have I got things backwards?  Even the more general version of (2) is 'regular cosubset'.  &#8212;Toby
