## Idea

Given a [[probability space]] $(S,\mathcal{F},\mu)$ and a [[random variable]] or [[random element]] $f \colon S \to X$, the **law** or **distribution** of $f$ (or sometimes, of $X$) is the [[probability measure]] on $X$ which to a [[measurable subset]] $A\subseteq X$ assigns the [[probability]] that $f$ takes values in $A$.

In particular, the law of $f$ is the [[pushforward measure|pushforward]] of $\mu$ along $f$.

## Examples

\begin{example}
  The law of a [[deterministic random variable]] is a [[Dirac measure]].
\end{example}
