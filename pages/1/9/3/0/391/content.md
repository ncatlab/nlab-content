#Idea#

The concept of _enriched homotopical category_ is the generalization of the concept of [[homotopical category]] to the context of [[enriched category theory]].

The idea is that the [[homotopy category]] $Ho_C$ of a category $C$ which is enriched over a suitable [[monoidal category|monoidal]]  and [[homotopical category|homotopical]] category $V$ is itself a $Ho_V$-enriched category.

#Defintion#

For $V$ a [[closed monoidal homotopical category]],
a $V$-[[enriched category]] $C$ with [[power|powers]] and [[copower|copowers]] and with the structure of a [[homotopical category]] on its underlying category $C_0$ is a **$V$-homotopical category** when equipped with a [[deformation retract for the enrichment]].


#Consequences#

[[closed monoidal homotopical category|Recall]] that for $V$ as above, $Ho_V$ is closed monoidal.

###### Proposition
With $C$ a $V$-homotopical category, $Ho_{C_0}$ is the underlying category of a $Ho_V$-enriched category.
=--

Write $Ho_C$ for this $Ho_V$-enriched category.  This is the enriched analogue of the [[homotopy category]] of $C$.
