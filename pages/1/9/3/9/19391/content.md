## Idea

Linear-non-linear logic is a presentation of intuitionistic [[linear logic]] that decomposes the $!$ modality into an [[adjunction]] of between a syntax for a [[cartesian product|cartesian]] logic and a linear logic with cartesian variables.

The semantics of linear-non-linear logic is more direct than that of intuitionistic linear logic: it is based on a symmetric [[monoidal adjunction]] where the source of the left adjoint is a [[cartesian monoidal category]].

## Related

* If the linear context is restricted to having at most one variable, the judgmental structure of linear-non-linear logic coincides with [[call-by-push-value|call-by-push-value with stacks]].
