## Idea

The _Kobayashi-Hitchin correspondence_ states that over suitable [[complex manifolds]] the [[moduli space]] of [[stable vector bundle|semi-stable vector bundles]] and that of [[Hermite-Einstein connections]] are essentially the same.

For the special case over [[complex curves]] and [[Kähler manifolds]] this is the _[[Donaldson-Uhlenbeck-Yau theorem]]_.
