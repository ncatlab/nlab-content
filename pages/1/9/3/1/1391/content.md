Is there a simplicial nerve that\'s not of simplicial categories?  If not, I\'d put the article here instead of there.  ---Toby

[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: yes, it seems to be called just "simplicial nerve" in the literature, but I found that a bit undescriptive, since every nerve is "simplicial" and here the point is really that we take the nerve _of_ a simplicial category. I also seem to recall that [[Tim Porter|Tim]] said he doesn't like the term "simplicial nerve". Maybe Tim should decide, he is probably the one among us who has thought about this notion the most.

_Toby_:  Ah, I see how 'simplicial nerve' is confusing; so how about just [[nerve of a simplicial category]]?

[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: right, that might be the best option -- I have to run now, maybe you can implement that?
