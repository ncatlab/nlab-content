#Definition#

The _special orthogonal group_ $SO(n)$ is the [[connected component]] of the neutral element in the [[orthogonal group]] $O(n)$.

It is the first step in the [[Whitehead tower]] of $O(n)$

$$
  \cdots \to Fivebrane(n)
  \to String(n) \to Spin(n)
  \to SO(n)
  \to O(n)
$$

[[Fivebrane group]] $\to$ [[String group]] $\to$ Spin group $\to$ [[special orthogonal group]] to [[orthogonal group]].

#Orientation of manifolds#

A lift of the classifying map $X \to \mathcal{B}O(n)$ of the $O(n)$-[[principal bundle]] to which the [[tangent bundle]] $T X$ is [[associated bundle|associted]] is the same as a choice of [[orientation]] of $X$.
