## Idea

In variation of how a [[symmetric group representation]] (or $Sym(n)$-module) may equivalently be thought of as a [[functor]] 

* from the [[delooping groupoid]] $\mathbf{B}Sym(n)$ 

  or equivalently from the [[core]] [[groupoid]] of the [[full subcategory]] of [[FinSet|$FinSet$]] on the [[finite sets]] of [[cardinality]] $n$

* to [[Vect]] (or to $R$[[Mod]] for some [[ring]] $R$)

so an *FI-representation* is a [[functor]] to [[Vect]] (or $R$[[Mod]]) from the larger category [[FinSetInj|$FinSet_{inj}$]] of *all* [[finite sets]] with [[morphism]] all the [[injective maps]] between these.

So an FI-representation is, in particular, one [[symmetric group representation|$Sym(n)$-representation]] in the sense of ordinary [[representation theory]], for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, but in addition equipped with a system of [[intertwiners]] between these.

## Properties

### Relation to representation stability

One reason that FI-representation draw attention is that they exhibit the phenomenon called *[[representation stability]]*, and in fact the FI-representation theory thereby serves to "explain" the occurence of various stability phenomena seen the the study of [[moduli spaces]], notably in the study of ordered [[configuration spaces of points]].
