## Idea

The multiplicative [[unit]] in the [[natural numbers]] $\mathbb{N}$, [[integers]] $\mathbb{Z}$, [[real numbers]] $\mathbb{R}$ and [[complex numbers]] $\mathbb{C}$ is pronounced **one** and denoted "$1$".  Originally, in [[Euclid]]'s *[[Elements]]*, Book VII, this element $1 \in \mathbb{N}$ is called a *mονάς* (cf. [here](monad+terminology#Euclid) at *[[monad terminology]]*).


More generally, in any [[group]], or even any [[monoid]], the group operation is often called 'multiplication' and written as juxtaposition, and then the [[neutral element]] $\mathrm{e}$ is sometimes also denoted "$1$".  As a consequence, in any [[ring]], or more generally any [[rig]], the two binary operations are called 'addition' and 'multiplication', and the identity for multiplication is called **one**.

[[vertical categorification|Categorifying]] this idea, in any [[monoidal category]] the [[unit object]] may be called **one**, best denoted now by a bolder font, such as $\mathbb{1}$.  This is especially true in the case of a [[cartesian monoidal category]], that is a category with (at least finitary) [[products]].  In this case the [[terminal object]], which serves as the identity for products, is often denoted "$1$":

$$x \times 1 \cong x$$

For example, in the [[category theory]]-literature the [[singleton set]] is often denoted $1$.

Categorifying [[horizontal categorification|horizontally]] instead, any [[identity morphism]] may be thought of as an analog of one and is often written $1$.

All these ideas can be, and have been, categorified further.
