A __discrete space__ is, in general, an object of a [[concrete category]] of spaces that is [[free functor|free]] on its underlying set.  Every [[topological concrete category]] has discrete spaces; so do many other categories, such as [[Diff]] and [[Hausdorff space|Haus Top]].

Note that we want, for this to make sense, that the functor
$$ Set \stackrel{F}\to Sp \stackrel{U}\to Set $$
is ([[natural isomorphism|naturally isomorphic]] to) the [[identity functor]] on [[Set]], where $F: Set \to Sp$ is [[adjoint functor|left adjoint]] to the [[forgetful functor]] $U: Sp \to Set$.  (This is true, for example, if $Sp$ is [[Top]], [[Diff]], [[Loc]], etc.)

###Example###

The best known example is a discrete topological space, that is one, $X$, in which all subsets of $X$ are open in the topology.
