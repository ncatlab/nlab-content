An __equilogical space__ is a [[separation axioms|$T_0$]] [[topological space]] $T$ along with an arbitrary [[equivalence relation]] $\equiv$ on its points (of note, the equivalence relation need not match the topological structure in any way). A morphism between equilogical spaces $(T, \equiv)$ and $(T', \equiv')$ is a continuous function $f : T \to T'$ such that $x \equiv y$ implies $f(x) \equiv' f(y)$, for all points $x$ and $y$ in $T$. Two such morphisms $f$ and $f'$ are considered equal if for all points $x$ in $T$, $f(x) \equiv' f'(x)$.

The category __Equ__ of equilogical spaces obviously contains the category of $T_0$ topological spaces as a [[full subcategory]] (by using the trivial equivalence relation of equality on points). Moreover, as opposed to the latter, Equ is in fact [[cartesian closed]]; this can be seen using the [[equivalence]] of Equ and the category of [[partial equivalence relation]]s over [[algebraic lattice]]s.

The concept was originally introduced for [[domain theory]] in a privately circulated manuscript by [[Dana Scott]].
