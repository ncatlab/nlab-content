## Idea

One of the main tenets of [[probability theory]] is that in general [[joint and marginal distributions|the probability of the product is not the product of the probabilities]], because of [[correlation]] and other statistical interactions. 
In particular, the probability of an [[infinite tensor product|infinite product]] is not the infinite product of the probabilities.

However, an infinite product is a [[cofiltered limit]] of finite products, and under some conditions, *the probability of an infinite product is the limit of the probability of the finite products*. 
One can interpret this fact as the absence of "infinitary correlations".

Statements of this kind are known collectively as the **Kolmogorov extension theorem**.
