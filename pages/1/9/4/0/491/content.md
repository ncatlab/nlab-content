In the [[foundations]] of mathematics, finitism is the philosophy that one should not assume the [[axiom of infinity]], or perhaps should even deny it by an axiom of finiteness. This make it impossible to do analysis as we normally understand it.

Finitism (in the weak sense of not accepting an axiom of infinity) is essentially the mathematics that can be done internal to an arbitrary [[topos]] (at least if one is not also being [[predicativism|predicativist]]). For [[constructivism|constructive mathematics]] as usually practised, one goes beyond finitism by positing a [[natural numbers object]].

Although often considered a form of constructivism, finitism in the strong sense (actually denying the axiom of infinity) can make [[excluded middle]] and even the [[axiom of choice]] constructively acceptable. This is because even constructivists agree that these are true in the category [[FinSet]] of [[finite set]]s (for an appropriate sense of 'finite'); it\'s the extension of them to infinite sets that the first constructivists objected to.

For the opinionated espousal of finitism (and much else), one can hardly do better than [Doron Zeilberger\'s Opinions](http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/OPINIONS.html).
