## Idea

[Narya](https://github.com/gwaithimirdain/narya) is an experimental [[proof assistant]], developed primarily so far by [[Mike Shulman]], for higher-dimensional [[type theories]] including [[higher observational type theory]] (H.O.T.T.), [[parametric type theory]], and [[displayed type theory]].

The name is a nod to *[Narya](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Narya)*, the Ring of Fire.
