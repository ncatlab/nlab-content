## Idea

In [[stable homotopy theory]], the [[stable homotopy category]] [[Ho(Spectra)]] or the [[stable (infinity,1)-category|stable $(\infty,1)$-category]] [[Spectra]] of [[spectra]] is often conceived of as a [[localization]] (the [[homotopy category of a model category|homotopy category]] of a [[Bousfield localization of model categories]] or the [[reflective sub-(infinity,1)-categories|reflective sub-$(\infty,1)$-category]]) of  an ambient auxiliary [[category]] or [[(infinity,1)-category|$(\infty,1)$-category]] of "pre-spectra". The localization by *[[spectrification]]* then turns a pre-spectrum into a genuine [[spectrum]].

In the simplest and historically first model, pre-spectra are *[[sequential spectra]]* and the genuine [[spectra]] among these are the *[[Omega-spectra]]*. 

More generally, [[highly structured spectra]] such as [[symmetric spectra]], [[orthogonal spectra]] or [[S-modules]] are all, *a priori*, pre-spectra.
