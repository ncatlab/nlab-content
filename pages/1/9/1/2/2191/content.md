## Idea
 {#Idea}

In [[vertical categorification]] of how [[monoids]]/[[monoid objects]] $A$ may [[action|act]] on other objects $N$ ([[action objects]], [[module objects]]) inside an ambient [[monoidal category]] by [[maps]]

$$
  A \otimes N \longrightarrow N
  \,.
$$

satisfying the [action property](action#eq:ActionProperty), so a [[monoidal category]] $\mathcal{A}$ may act on other *[[categories]]* $\mathcal{N}$ by [[functors]] 

$$
  \oslash 
  \;\colon\;
  \mathcal{A} \times \mathcal{N}
  \longrightarrow
  \mathcal{N}
$$

subject to [[associators]], [[unitors]] and [[coherence conditions]] for [[action objects]] [[coherence|coherently]] [[internalization|internalized]] into the [[2-category]] [[Cat]], analogous to the laws in a [[monoidal category]].

At least if some linear structure is present and respected (such as when $\mathcal{A}$ qualifies as a [[2-ring]]) it is natural to speak of *[[module categories]]* over $\mathcal{A}$ (see also at *[[n-module|$n$-module]]*).

Similarly, compatible actions from both sides, such as for a [[bimodule]], give a notion of *[[bimodule category]].

Note that the term **actegory**, introduced by [McCrudden (2000)](#McCrudden00)[^1], is often used in the literature for this concept, and consequently **[[biactegory]]** for the two-sided case. However, since "actegory" is a single transposition away from "category", we prefer to use the explicit terminology on this page and elsewhere.

[^1]: From [Cockett & Pastro (2007)](#CockettPastro07): "The term *actegory* is used to describe the situation of a monoidal category “acting” on a category.  They first appeared (under a different name) in the work of B&eacute;nabou as a simple example of a bicategory. B. Pareigis developed the theory of actegories (again under a different name) and showed there usefulness in the representation theory of monoids and comonoids. The word “actegory” was first suggested at the Australian Category Seminar and first appeared in print in the thesis of P. McCrudden where they were used to study categories of representations of coalgebroids."



## Definition

For any [[category]] $A$, the category of [[endofunctors]] $End(A)$ is [[monoidal category|monoidal]] with respect to the (horizontal) composition (the composition of functors and the [[Godement product]] for natural transformations).

Given a [[monoidal category]] $(C,\otimes,I,l,r,a)$ a (left or right) __$C$-module category__ is a category $A$ together with a (left or right) coherent action of $C$ on $A$. Depending on author and context, the left coherent action of $C$ on $A$ is a morphism of monoidal categories $C\to End(A)$ in the lax, colax, pseudo or strict sense (most often in pseudo-sense) or, in another terminology, a monoidal, comonoidal, strong monoidal or strict [[monoidal functor]]. Right coherent actions correspond to the monoidal functors into the category $End(A)$ with the opposite tensor product. 

$C$-module categories, colax $C$-equivariant functors and natural transformations of colax $C$-equivariant functors form a [[strict 2-category]] $_C Act^c$. A [[monad]] in $_C Act^c$ amounts to a pair of a monad in $Cat$ and a [[distributive law]] between the monad and an action of $C$. 

The notion of $C$-action (hence a $C$-module category) is easily extendable to [[bicategories]] (see Bakovi&#263;'s thesis).

###### Definition
A **(left) $\mathcal{C}$-module category** is

1. a category $\mathcal{A}$;
1. a functor $\oslash : \mathcal{C} \times \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{A}$ called the *action*;
1. a natural isomorphism $\lambda_a : a \to I \oslash a$ called the *unitor*;
1. a natural isomorphism $\alpha_{c,d,a} : c \oslash (d \oslash a) \to (c \otimes d) \oslash a$ called the *actor*;

satisfying a pentagonal and two triangular laws (see [KJ01](#KJ01), diagg. (1.1)-(1.3)) that witness the coherence of $\lambda$ and $\alpha$ with the unitors and associators of $\mathcal{C}$.

## Connection with enrichment 
If a category $D$ is [[enriched category|enriched]] in $C$ with [[copowers]], then the copower structure forms a module category on the ordinary category underlying $D$. 

Conversely, if module category is such that the functor $(-)\oslash d:C\to D$ has a [[right adjoint]] for all objects $d$ of $D$, then the right adjoints $D(d,-):D\to C$ provide an enrichment of $D$ in $C$ for which the action is a copower. See [KJ01](#KJ01).
