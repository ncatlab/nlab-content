## Idea

As [[monoidal categories]] are a [[vertical categorification]] of [[monoids]], *actegories* are a [[vertical categorification]] of *[[actions]]* of a monoid.
So given a monoidal category $(C,\otimes,I,l,r,a)$ an actegory is another category $D$ with a notion of "tensor by object of $C$", i.e., a functor:

$$\oslash : C \times D \to D$$

that is associative and unital up to natural isomorphism with respect to $\otimes$ in ways that generalize actions of a monoid, and satisfy coherence laws similar to those of a monoidal category.

## Definition

For any [[category]] $A$, the category of [[endofunctors]] $End(A)$ is [[monoidal category|monoidal]] with respect to the (horizontal) composition (the composition of functors and the [[Godement product]] for natural transformations).

Given a [[monoidal category]] $(C,\otimes,I,l,r,a)$ a (left or right) __$C$-actegory__ is a category $A$ together with a (left or right) coherent action of $C$ on $A$. Depending on author and context, the left coherent action of $C$ on $A$ is a morphism of monoidal categories $C\to End(A)$ in the lax, colax, pseudo or strict sense (most often in pseudo-sense) or, in another terminology, a monoidal, comonoidal, strong monoidal or strict [[monoidal functor]]. Right coherent actions correspond to the monoidal functors into the category $End(A)$ with the opposite tensor product. 

$C$-actegories, colax $C$-equivariant functors and natural transformations of colax $C$-equivariant functors form a [[strict 2-category]] $_C Act^c$. A [[monad]] in $_C Act^c$ amounts to a pair of a monad in $Cat$ and a [[distributive law]] between the monad and an action of $C$. 

The notion of $C$-action (hence a $C$-actegory) is easily extendable to [[bicategories]] (see Bakovi&#263;'s thesis).

###### Definition
A **(left) $\mathcal{C}$-actegory** is

1. a category $\mathcal{A}$;
1. a functor $\oslash : \mathcal{C} \times \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{A}$ called the *action*;
1. a natural isomorphism $\lambda_a : a \to I \oslash a$ called the *unitor*;
1. a natural isomorphism $\alpha_{c,d,a} : c \oslash (d \oslash a) \to (c \otimes d) \oslash a$ called the *actor*;

satisfying a pentagonal and two triangular laws (see [KJ01](#KJ01), diagg. (1.1)-(1.3)) that witness the coherence of $\lambda$ and $\alpha$ with the unitors and associators of $\mathcal{C}$.

## Connection with enrichment 
If a category $D$ is [[enriched category|enriched]] in $C$ with [[copowers]], then the copower structure forms an actegory on the ordinary category underlying $D$. 

Conversely, if an actegory is such that the functor $(-)\oslash d:C\to D$ has a [[right adjoint]] for all objects $d$ of $D$, then the right adjoints $D(d,-):D\to C$ provide an enrichment of $D$ in $C$ for which the action is a copower. See [KJ01](#KJ01).

## Related Concepts

* If an actegory is like a [[module]], then a _[[biactegory]]_ is like a [[bimodule]].
