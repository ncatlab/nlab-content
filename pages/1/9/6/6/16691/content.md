## Idea

In the present [[standard model of particle physics]] the [[proton]] is a stable [[bound state]] (of [[quarks]]). But in some hypothetical extensions of the standard model, notably in many [[GUT]] [[model (physics)|models]], the proton would be unstable, albeit with an extremely long decay time, and hence could decay (e.g. [Kole&#353;ov&#225;-Malinský 14](#KolesovaMalinski14)).

[[experiment|Experimental]] searches for rare proton decay show that the minimum mean lifetime of the proton is at least on the order of $10^{31}$ [[years]] (e.g. [Super-Kamiokande 15](#SuperKamiokande15)), probably higher. 

Since the age of the [[observable universe]] is about $1.3 \cdot 10^{10}$ [[years]], this translates to saying that on average at most one proton in 10 kilotons of protons (essentially 10 kilotons of [[hydrogen atoms]]) decays per [[year]].

More recently it has been claimed that [[GUT]] [[model (physics)|models]] may entirely avoid proton decay after all ([Mütter-Ratz-Vaudrevange 16](#MuetterRatzVaudrevange16), [Fornal-Grinstein 17](#FornalGrinstein17)).
