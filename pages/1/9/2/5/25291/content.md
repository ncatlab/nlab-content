## Definition

An [[internal category]] object in the category of [[smooth manifolds]] in which the source and target maps are [[submersions]].

Sometimes, the smooth manifold of morphisms is allowed to have a boundary, in which case the restrictions of the source and target maps to the boundary are required to be [[submersions]] themselves.
