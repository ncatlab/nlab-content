###### Definition

A **Poisson algebra** is

* a [[module]] $A$ over some [[field]] or other [[commutative ring]] $k$,

* equipped with the structure ${\cdot}\colon A \otimes_k A \to A$ of an [[associative algebra]];

* and equipped with the structure $[-,-]\colon A \otimes_k A \to A$ of a [[Lie algebra]];

* such that for every $a \in A$ we have that $[a,-]\colon A \to A$ is a [[derivation]] of $(A,\cdot)$.

###### Definition

The [[opposite category]] of that of commutative real Poisson algebras can be identified with the category of **[[classical mechanical systems]]**

$$
  ClassMechSys := CPoiss^{op}
  \,.
$$ 

See there for more details.

###### Example

For $(X, \{-,-\})$ a [[Poisson manifold]] or $(X, \omega)$ a [[symplectic manifold]], the algebra of [[smooth function]]s $C^\infty(X, \mathbb{R})$ is naturally a Poisson algebra, thus may be regarded as an object in $ClassMechSys$. For classical mechanical systems of this form, we say that the [[manifold]] $X$ is the [[phase space]] of the system.

Generally, therefore, for $(A, \cdot,[-,-])$ a Poisson algebra, we may regard it as a formal dual to some generalized Phase space.

###### Remark

For $(A, \cdot, \{-,-\})$ a Poisson algebra, $A$ together with its [[module]] $\Omega^1(A)$ of [[KÃ¤hler differential]]s naturally form a [[Lie-Rinehart pair]], with bracket given by

$$
  [d a, d b ] := d \{a,b\}
  \,.
$$

If the Poisson algebra comes from a [[Poisson manifold]] $X$, then this Lie-Rinehart pair is the [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] of the given [[Poisson Lie algebroid]] over $X$. We can therefore identify classical mechanical systems over a phase space manifold also with Poisson Lie algebroids.
