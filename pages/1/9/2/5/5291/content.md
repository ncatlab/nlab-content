###### Definition

A **Poisson algebra** is

* a [[module]] $A$ over some [[field]] or other [[commutative ring]] $k$,

* equipped with the structure ${\cdot}\colon A \otimes_k A \to A$ of an [[associative algebra]];

* and equipped with the structure $[-,-]\colon A \otimes_k A \to A$ of a [[Lie algebra]];

* such that for every $a \in A$ we have that $[a,-]\colon A \to A$ is a [[derivation]] of $(A,\cdot)$.
