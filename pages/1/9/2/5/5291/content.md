## Definition

###### Definition

A **Poisson algebra** is

* a [[module]] $A$ over some [[field]] or other [[commutative ring]] $k$,

* equipped with the structure ${\cdot}\colon A \otimes_k A \to A$ of a commutative [[associative algebra]];

* and equipped with the bracket $[-,-]\colon A \otimes_k A \to A$ of a [[Lie algebra]];

* such that for every $a \in A$ we have that $[a,-]\colon A \to A$ is a [[derivation]] of $(A,\cdot)$.

The definition makes sense, but is not standardly used, also for the more general case when the product $\cdot$ is not necessarily commutative (it is often however taken in the sense of commutative internally to a symmetric monoidal category, say of chain complexes, graded vector spaces or supervector spaces).

###### Definition

The [[opposite category]] of that of (commutative) real Poisson algebras can be identified with the category of **[[classical mechanical systems]]**

$$
  ClassMechSys := CPoiss^{op}
  \,.
$$ 

See there for more details.

###### Example

For $(X, \{-,-\})$ a [[Poisson manifold]] or $(X, \omega)$ a [[symplectic manifold]], the algebra of [[smooth function]]s $C^\infty(X, \mathbb{R})$ is naturally a Poisson algebra, thus may be regarded as an object in $ClassMechSys$. For classical mechanical systems of this form, we say that the [[manifold]] $X$ is the [[phase space]] of the system.

Generally, therefore, for $(A, \cdot,[-,-])$ a Poisson algebra, we may regard it as a formal dual to some generalized Phase space.

###### Remark

For $(A, \cdot, \{-,-\})$ a Poisson algebra, $A$ together with its [[module]] $\Omega^1(A)$ of [[KÃ¤hler differential]]s naturally form a [[Lie-Rinehart pair]], with bracket given by

$$
  [d a, d b ] := d \{a,b\}
  \,.
$$

If the Poisson algebra comes from a [[Poisson manifold]] $X$, then this Lie-Rinehart pair is the [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] of the given [[Poisson Lie algebroid]] over $X$. We can therefore identify classical mechanical systems over a phase space manifold also with Poisson Lie algebroids.

### For a symplectic manifold
 {#FromSymplecticManifold}

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A [[symplectic manifold]] $(X, \omega)$
canonically is a [[Poisson manifold]] $(X; \{-,-\})$ by 
defining the Poisson bracket as follows.

By the symplectic structure, 
to every [[smooth function]] $f \in C^\infty(X)$
is associated the correspinding [[Hamiltonian vector field]]
$v_f \in \Gamma(T X)$, defined, uniquely, by the equation

$$
  d_{dR} f = \iota_{v_f} \omega
  \,.
$$

In terms of this, the Poisson bracket is given by

$$
  \{f,g\} := \iota_{v_g} \iota_{v_f} \omega
  \,.
$$

## Properties

### For a symplectic manifold

Let $(X, \omega)$ be a [[symplectic manifold]],
and $(X, \{-,-\})$ the corresponding [[Poisson manifold]]
as [above](FromSymplecticManifold). 

Write
$\mathcal{P} := (C^\infty(X), \{-,-\})$ for the [[Lie algebra]]
underlying the Poisson algebra.

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

This fits into a [[central extension]] of Lie algebras

$$
  \mathbb{T} \to \mathcal{P} \to Ham(X)
  \,,
$$

where $Ham(X) \subset \Gamma(T X)$ is the sub-Lie algebra of [[vector fields]] on the [[Hamiltonian vector fields]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Observe that the [[Hamiltonian]] function associated to a 
[[Hamiltonian vector field]] is well-defined only up to addition of 
a constant function.

This is also called the **Kostant-Souriau central extension** 
(see [Kostant 1970](#Kostant)).
