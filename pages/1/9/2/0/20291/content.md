## Definition

A [[topological space]] is metacompact if every [[countable set|countable]] [[open cover]] has a point finite open refinement which covers $X$.

## Examples

* Every [[paracompact topological space]] is metacompact.

* Every [[sigma-compact topological space|sigma-compact]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] space is metacompact.
