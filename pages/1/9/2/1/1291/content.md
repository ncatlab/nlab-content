For any two [[full subcategory|full subcategories]] $S$ and $T$ of an abelian category $A$, define their __Gabriel product__ $S\bullet T$ as the full subcategory of $A$ generated by all objects $M$ such that $M$ fits in a short [[exact sequence]] of the
form 
$$
0\to N\to M\to P\to 0
$$
where $N$ is an object in $S$ and $P$ is an object in $S$.

Surely one of these should be in $T$?  It\'s arbitrary, so I\'ll let somebody else decide what the convention is.  ---[[Toby Bartels]]

When restricted to the class of [[topologizing subcategory|topologizing subcategories]], Gabriel multiplication is associative; if $A$ is small then the topologizing subcategories make a semiring with respect to the commutative operation $\cap$ and Gabriel multiplication; in particular $\bullet$ is left and right distributive with respect to intersection of topologizing subcategories.  

In the case of the abelian category of modules over a ring, the Gabriel multiplication is sometimes expressed in terms of filters of ideals, rather than abelian subcategories.
