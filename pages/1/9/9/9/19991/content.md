## Idea

A **space group** on $\mathbb{R}^n$, also known as a **crystallographic group**, is a [[subgroup]] of the [[group]] of [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] motions that contains some [[lattice]] in $\mathbb{R}^n$ as a subgroup, and is contained within the [[automorphism group]] of the lattice. In other words, it is a subgroup of the automorphism group of the lattice that contains all the [[translations]] by elements of the lattice itself.

Equivalently, it can be defined as a subgroup of the group of Euclidean motions that contains a lattice of translations as a [[normal subgroup]].

In 2 dimensions, there are 17 distinct groups, known as [[wallpaper groups]]. In 3 dimensions, there are 219 distinct types, or 230 if chiral copies are considered distinct. The classification of space groups has been carried out up to 6 dimensions.
