## Idea

The two fundamental [[no-go theorems]] for [[hidden variable theory|hidden variable]] reconstructions of the [[quantum mechanics|quantum]] statistics, the [[Kochen-Specker theorem]] and [[Bell's theorem]], may be formulated as results about the impossibility of associating a classical [[probability space]] with a [[quantum system]], when certain constraints are placed on the [[probability measure]]. 

The _Bub-Clifton-Halvorson theorem_ ([Bub-Clifton 96](#BubClifton96), [Clifton-Bub-Halvorson 03](#CliftonBubHalvorson03)) on the other hand is a positive result about the possibility of associating a classical probability space with a quantum system in a given state.

Given a [[Hilbert space]] $H$ and a [[quantum observable]] represented by a [[Hermitean operator]] on this space, and given a [[pure state]], the Bub-Clifton theorem characterizes a maximal sub-[[lattice]] of the Birkhoff-vonNeumann [[Hilbert lattice]] of subspace of $H$ (the "[[quantum logic]]" of $H$) such that there are sufficiently many yes-no questions on the elements in the lattice to recover all the probabilities induced by the given pure state to compatible sets of projections ([[classical contexts]]).
