
**Moritz Hauptmann** (1792-1868) was a German composer and music theorist. In the succession of Johann Sebastian Bach he was _Thomaskantor_ in Leipzig.

In his writings he tried to develop tonal music from first principles based on the progresive mediation of units and their opposites within themselves. Traditionally (Hugo Riemann, [[Karl Rosenkranz]], Peter Rummenhöller) this process of self-mediation of musical units has been identified with the [[Aufhebung]] from Hegelian dialectics whence Hauptmann's approach has broadly been characterized as "Hegelian" but this view was challenged by Wilhelm Seidel and Lothar Schmidt who stress the Goethean background of Hauptmann's aesthetics instead.
