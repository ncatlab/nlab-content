A __resummation__ is an operation which applies to some class of series and which makes some divergent [[series]] become convergent. 
Normally one requires that the operation makes sense also to the series which are convergent to start with and then the resummation gives a series with the same sum as the original one.

The main historical reference is the monograph of Hardy, still very readable (and of course, accurate).

Some resummation methods can be made sense also from the point of view of [[nonstandard analysis]].
