## Idea

In [[perturbation theory]] (in [[QFT]]) a _tachyon_ is an excitation/[[particle]] with _negative [[mass]] squared_, hence technically with [[imaginary number|imaginary]] mass.

Since the masses of particles in [[perturbation theory]] give the second derivative of the background potential energy at the point about which the [[perturbation series]] is developed, a tachyon in the spectrum indicates that the [[perturbation theory]] is set up about an _unstable_ [[vacuum]].

The [[dynamics]] of a tachyon will hence make it form a [[condensate]] at an actual local [[potential energy]] [[minimum]]. Once there it is no longer a tachyon, but a genuine [[particle]] excitation ("tachyon decay").

## Examples

### In bosonic string theory

The excitation of the [[open string]] in [[bosonic string theory]] famously contains a tachyon mode. By [[Sen's conjecture]] this indicates the instability of the space-filling [[D25-brane]] on which the ends of the open bosonic string propagate. Using [[string field theory]] to get a [[non-perturbative field theory|non-perturbative]] description of the situation one can follow the decay of the [[D25-brane]] to the "true" (stable) open [[bosonic string theory]] [[vacuum]]. (Where however analysis shows that this no longer contains open string excitations, so it is maybe better called a closed string vacuum.) See at _[[Sen's conjecture]]_ for more.

The fate of the [[closed string|closed]] bosonic string tachyon is more subtle. But see the [references below](#ReferencesInStringTheory).

### In superstring theory

Similarly in [[superstring theory]] [[open string]] states between [[D-brane]]/[[anti D-brane]] pairs may be tachyonic, signallying the decay of these brane configurations. This leads to the conjectured classification of [[D-brane charge]] in [[K-theory]] (see [there](D-brane#ReferencesKTheoryDescription)).
