## Writings

Gibbs seems to have been the first to publically discuss the detection of the [[Higgs particle]] at a [[rest mass]] of 125 [[GeV]], a little before the official announcement by the [[LHC]] collaborations:
 
* {#Gibbs11a} [[Philip Gibbs]], _Seminar Watch (Higgs Special), Rumoured Higgs at 125 GeV and What Would a Higgs at 125 GeV Tell Us?_, Prespacetime Journal, December 2011, Vol. 2 Issue 12 pp. 1899-1905 ([web](http://prespacetime.com/index.php/pst/article/view/308/298))

In this article Gibbs already highlights the near-criticality of the resulting Higgs [[vacuum]], first published on his blog as 

* _[What would a Higgs at 125 GeV tell us?](https://vixra.wordpress.com/2011/12/04/what-would-a-higgs-at-125-gev-tell-us/)_
