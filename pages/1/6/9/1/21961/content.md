## Idea

In the theory of [[gravity]] ([[general relativity]]) the _Penrose diagram_ of a given [[spacetime]] is a 2-dimensional depiction ([[time]] running vertically and a single spatial distance coordinate running horizontally) of its [[causal structure]], reflecting the projected image of the spacetime under a [[conformal transformation]] which makes [[events]] at [[timelike]]/[[spacelike]]/[[lightlike]] infinity of the spacetime appear at respective [[boundary]] points of its Penrose diagram.

## References

Due to [[Roger Penrose]].
