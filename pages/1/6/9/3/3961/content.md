## Idea

It is an old observation that xyz. One notices that from the [[nPOV]] this is just an abc. This leads to the  definition of a uvw. It is useful for doing klm and provides the basis for the more general theory of &#228;&#246;&#252;.


## Abstract

A uvw is effectively a uv together with a w. Its main property is encoded in Somebody's Theorem which says that it consists of precisely three letters. The archetypical example of a uvw is $\mu \nu \omega$.


## Definition

As Jacques Distler said,

###### Definition
**(uvw)**

A **uvw** is a UVW in which all letters are lower case.

This may be summed up in the slogan:

+-- {: .standout}
A uvw is just what it looks like.

###### Theorem

Every uvw contains exactly three letters.

## Examples

### Special cases

*  First case

*  Second case

*  Third case

+-- {: .query}
_[[Urs Schreiber|First person]]_:  I listed all of the special cases that I know above, but didn\'t Grothendieck study an important version too?

_[[Toby Bartels|Second person]]_:  No, you're thinking of Lawvere.  When I find the reference, I'll put it here.

### Specific examples

For ease of reference, we will number the examples.

1.  The first example is obvious.

2.  The second example is a slight variation of (1).

3.  The third example is completely different from either (1) or (2).
