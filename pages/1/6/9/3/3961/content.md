## Idea

It is an old observation that xyz. One notices that from the [[nPOV]] this is just an abc. This leads to the  definition of a uvw. It is useful for doing klm and provides the basis for the more general theory of &#228;&#246;&#252;.


## Abstract

A uvw is effectively a uv together with a w. Its main property is encoded in Somebody's Theorem which says that it consists of precisely three letters. The archetypical example of a uvw is a $\upsilon \nu \omega$.
