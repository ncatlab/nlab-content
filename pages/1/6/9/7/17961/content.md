## Idea

_Integral homotopy theory_ is the refinement of [[rational homotopy theory]] to integer coefficients. 

Just as there are two established approaches in rational homotopy theory for encoding rational homotopy types, those of Quillen and of Sullivan, so there are analog approaches for integral homotopy types. In ([Blomquist & Harper 16](#BlomquitHarper16)) chains in [[ordinary cohomology]] with [[rational number]] [[coefficients]] are lifted to chains with [[integer]] coefficients. While ([Horel 22](#Horel22)) and ([Yuan 23](#Yuan23)) both employ [[cochains]].
