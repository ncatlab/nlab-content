An __inverse limit__ is the same thing as a [[limit]].  (Similarly, a [[direct limit]] is the same thing as a [[colimit]].)  In this context, an __inverse system__ is the same thing as a [[diagram]], and an __inverse cone__ is the same thing as a [[cone]].

Many authors restrict this terminology to limits over [[codirected sets]] (or [[cofiltered categories]]); see __[[codirected limit]]__ (or __[[cofiltered limit]]__) for discussion of this case if you think that it may be what you want, or see __[[limit]]__ for the more general notion. Especially common is the codirected set $(\mathbb{N},\geq)$ of [[natural numbers]], in which case the inverse system may be called an __inverse sequence__.
