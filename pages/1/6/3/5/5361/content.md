## Definition

Every [[bicomplete category|bicomplete]] [[category]] (i.e. having all small [[limits]] and [[colimits]]) becomes a [[model category]] by setting:

* the [[weak equivalences]] are the [[isomorphisms]];

* every morphism is a [[fibration]];

* every morphism is a [[cofibration]].

This model structure regards $C$ as an [[(âˆž,1)-category]] with only trivial [[k-morphisms]] for $k \geq 2$.
