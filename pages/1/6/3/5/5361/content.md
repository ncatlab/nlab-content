Every [[category]] $C$ with [[limit]]s and [[colimit]]s becomes a [[model category]] by setting

* the weak equivalences are the [[isomorphisms]];

* every morphism is a fibration;

* every morphism is a cofibration.

This model structure regards $C$ as an [[(∞,1)-category]] with only trivial [[k-morphism]]s for $k \geq 2$.
