There are several contexts in which it is of relevance that a certain property of a [[morphism]] $f : A \to B$ is preserved under [[pullback]], i.e. also shared by the the morphism $X \times_B A \to X$ for any pullback diagram

$$
  \array{
     X \times_B A &\to& A
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     X &\to& B
  }
  \,.
$$

## colimits ##

Stability of [[colimit]]s under [[pullback]] is discussed at [[commutativity of limits and colimits]].  

## monomorphisms ##

There also other kinds of pullback stability; for example, the sense in which [[monomorphisms]] are stable under pullback.

## right lifting property: fibrations ##

Generally, the property of a morphism of having a [[weak factorization system|right lifting property]] is stable under pullback. Therefore for instance fibrations and acyclic fibrations in a [[model category]] are stable under pullback. If also weak equivalences are stable under pullback one speaks of a left proper model category.
