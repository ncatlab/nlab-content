The term **pre-additive category** may be synonymous to [[Ab-enriched category]], or it may be mean an $Ab$-enriched category with a [[zero object]]. 

It is used the first way for instance in section 8 of Kashiwara--Schapira: [[Categories and Sheaves]].

#Remarks#

* Pre-additive categories are part of a sequence of [[additive and abelian categories]].
