The term **pre-additive category** is synonymous to [[Ab-enriched category]]. 

It is used this way for instance in section 8 of Kashiwara-Schapira: [[Categories and Sheaves]].

#Remarks#

* Pre-additive categories are the first and least structures  in a sequence of [[additive and abelian categories]].
