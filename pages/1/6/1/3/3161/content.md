Herman Stel got his PhD in Mathematics at Universit&#224; degli Studi di Firenze under the guidance of Timo Sch&#252;rg. His thesis was entitled "On the road to a category of Kuranishi spaces: k-suicidal modules".

Under the guidance of Urs Schreiber he produced his master's thesis:

* H. Stel, _[[schreiber:master thesis Stel|∞-Stacks and their Function Algebras -- with Applications to ∞-Lie Theory]]_ (2010)

He is now studying the directed hypergraphs associated to Hilbert-style logics.
