Herman Stel got his PhD in Mathematics at Universit&#224; degli Studi di Firenze under the guidance of Timo Sch&#252;rg. Herman is now dead, in Erd&#246;s' sense, but hopes to be resuscitated later in life. His thesis was entitled "On the road to a category of Kuranishi spaces: k-suicidal modules".

Under the guidance of Urs Schreiber he produced his master's thesis:
