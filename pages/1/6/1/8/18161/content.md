For $p \colon E \to X$ a [[fiber bundle]] with [[typical fiber]] $F$, then a _local trivialization_ is a [[cover]] $U \to X$ such that there is a [[pullback]] square of the form

$$
  \array{
    U \times F &\longrightarrow& E
    \\
    \downarrow &(pb)& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    U &\longrightarrow& X
  }
$$
