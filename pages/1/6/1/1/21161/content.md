## Idea  

Given a [[groupoid infinity-action|group action]] on a [[graph]] $Y$ (with involution on the edges), one gets a quotient graph $X=Y/G$ together with the family of the stabilisers on the vertices and on the edges. Abstracting this gives a graph of groups.


## Definition

A graph of groups, $\Gamma(G,X)$, consists of

* a connected graph, $X$;

*  a function, $G$, which, for every vertex, $v\in V(X)$ assigns a group, $G_v$, and for each edge, $e\in E(X)$ assigns a group, $G_e$ such that $G_e= G_\overline{e}$

* For each edge, $e\in E(X)$, there exists a monomorphism, $\sigma::G_e\to G_{i(e)}$, where $i(e)$ is the initial vertex of the edge, $e$.

##Examples

In the usual form of Bass-Serre Theory a graph of groups is derived from the action of a group on a tree.
