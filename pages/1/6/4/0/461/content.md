## Definition

The **empty set** $\emptyset$ is the [[set]] with no [[element]]s.

The empty set is unique in most membership-based [[foundations]], but in any case we can say 'the' empty set, since any two empty sets are isomorphic by a unique isomorphism (the [[generalized the]]). 

In fact, the empty set is given by a [[universal property]]: it is the [[initial object]] in the  [[category]] [[Set]] of all sets: for every set $S$, there is a unique [[function]]

$$
  \emptyset \stackrel{\exists !}{\to} S
  \,.
$$



## Aspects of the empty set

The empty set can be confusing, because it is a degenerate case. Indeed, it is defined as an exception: every set is [[inhabited set|inhabited]], except the empty set. Nothing belongs to the empty set, but the empty set itself is something. Mathematics students are confused that there is a function from the empty set to itself, and even grown mathematicians will misstate definitions because they forget about the empty set.

In terms of the empty set one can give sense to the expression $0^0$, the [[exponentiation]] of [[zero]] with itself. The meaning of course depends on how exponentiation (in a [[ring]] or [[rig]] that admits [[exponentiation]]) is defined; if the rig is the [[natural number]]s and exponentiation $m^n$ is defined to be the [[cardinality]] of the [[hom-set]] $\hom_{Set}([m], [n])$ where $[m]$ is an $m$-element set, then $0^0 = 1$ unambiguously, exactly because $\emptyset$ is an [[initial object]]. But exponentiation for the [[real number]] field ($x^y$ for $x \gt 0$) is standardly defined by continuity considerations, and cannot be continuously extended to cover $0^0$. Note that the latter point has nothing to do with the empty set!
