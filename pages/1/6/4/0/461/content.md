The **empty set** is the [[set]] with no elements.

The empty set is unique in most membership-based [[foundations]], but in any case we can say 'the' empty set, since any two empty sets are isomorphic by a unique isomorphism (the [[generalized the]]). In fact, the empty set is given by a [[universal property]]: it is the [[initial object]] in the [[Set|category of sets]].

The empty set can be confusing, because it is a degenerate case. Indeed, it is defined as an exception: every set is [[inhabited set|inhabited]], except the empty set. Nothing belongs to the empty set, but the empty set itself is something. Mathematics students are confused that there is a function from the empty set to itself, and algebra textbooks still teach them that $0^0$ is undefined. Even grown mathematicians will misstate definitions because they forget about the empty set.

_[[Mike Shulman|Mike]]_: To be fair to the algebra textbooks, there are other meanings of exponentiation for which $0^0$ is harder to get a handle on.  For instance, if the limits as $x \to 0$ of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are both 0, we still can't say much about the limit of $(f(x))^{g(x)}$.
