A simple example of a solenoid is the dyadic solenoid.  This is the [[inverse limit]] of the **inverse sequence**, $(X(n),p_n)$, in which each $X(n)$ is a copy of $S^1$ and each 'structure map' $p_n:X(n)\to X(n-1)$ is given by the squaring map on the circle, that is $e^{i\theta}\mapsto e^{2i\theta}$.

We will restrict attention, for the moment, to the class of solenoids defined by inverse sequences of circles:

##General definition

Let $P = (r_1,\ldots, r_n,\ldots)$ be a sequence of prime numbers.  The _$P$-adic-solenoid_ is the space,

$S_P = Lim (X(n),p_n,\mathbb{N})$

where for each $n$, $X(n)= S^1$ and (considering $S^1$ as the unit circle in $\mathbb{C}$), $p_n(z) = z^{r_n}$.

The $P$-adic solenoid is a compact, connected [[topological group]]

##Solenoids and shape

In [[shape theory]], the solenoids provide good examples of _non-stable- spaces_. If one takes the &#268;ech fundamental group of $S_P$, then it is the limit of the inverse sequence of the fundamental groups of the $X(n)$ together with the induced homomorphisms. It thus is trivial. The Strong Shape fundamental group of $S_P$ is not trivial as it involves the first derived functor $Lim^{(1)}$ of the inverse sequence of groups as well.
