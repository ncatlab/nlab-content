##Â Idea

Let $S$ be a [[set]].  Then the __improper subset__ of $S$ is $S$ itself, viewed as a [[subset]] of itself.

As the subsets of $S$ correspond to the [[predicates]] on $S$ and to the [[unary relations]] on $S$, so the improper subset corresponds to the predicate that is always [[true]] and the relation which always holds.

As the subsets of $S$ correspond to the [[injections]] to $S$ (up to [[isomorphism]] in the [[slice category]] $Set/S$), so the improper subset corresponds to the [[identity function]] $\id_S\colon S \to S$ (or to any [[bijection]] to $S$, since these are all isomorphic in $Set/S$).

The improper subset is the [[top element]] of the [[power set]] $\mathcal{P}S$, viewed as a [[lattice]].

The improper subset is so called because it is not a [[proper subset]]; by [[excluded middle]], it is the only subset that is not proper.

## Generalizations

The notion of improper subset could be generalized from [[Set]] to any category $C$ as the notion of **improper subobject**. 

If a [[subobject]] of an [[object]] $A \in \mathrm{Ob}(C)$ is an [[isomorphism class]] of [[monomorphisms]] into $A$, then an **improper subobject** is of an object $A \in \mathrm{Ob}(C)$ is an [[isomorphism class]] of [[isomorphisms]] into $A$.
