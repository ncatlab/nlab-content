Meta matrices are matrices consisting of matrices.  For example, an ordinary n X n matrix (A) would have either numbers or variable in the respective rows and columns.  An n X n hyper matrix (&#9398;) would have matrices instead of numbers in each of its entries for each row and column.

There are basically two types of meta matrices.  There first type is called a singular meta matrix which is that all the matrices in the meta matrix are
n x n if the meta matrix is n x n.  

The second type of meta matrix is called a compound meta matrix where the 
matrices of the n x n meta matrix are all m x m.     


Most of the same rules apply to hyper matrix operations that would apply to ordinary matrix operations.  For instance, the 2 X 2 singular meta matrix (&#9398;) + the 
2 X 2 singular meta matrix (&#9399;) would be A11 + B11 = C11 and A12 + B12 = C12.  A21 + B21 = C21 and A22 + B22 = C22 (the C entries of course would be the entries in the 2 X 2 singular meta matrix (&#9400;)).  

A11 + B11 = C11 would be a1111 + b1111 = c1111, a1211 + b1211 = c1211, 
                         a2111 + b2111 = c2111, a2211 + b2211 = c2211.  
A12 + B12 = C12 would be a1112 + b1112 = c1111, a1212 + b1212 = c1212, 
                         a2112 + b2112 = c2112, a2212 + b2212 = c2212.
 
A21 + B21 = C21 would be a1121 + b1121 = c1121, a1221 + b1221 = c1221, 
                         a2111 + b2111 = c2111, a2211 + b2211 = c2211.  
A22 + B22 = C22 would be a1122 + b1122 = c1122, a1222 + b1222 = c1222, 
                         a2122 + b2122 = c2122, a2222 + b2222 = c2222. 

The first two numbers in the subscripts indicate the entries of the ordinary matrix and the last two numbers of the subscript indicate the entries of the hyper matrix. So, in effect, &#9398; + &#9399; = &#9400;.
    
If the meta matrices were compound then the equation would look like this:
       
&#9398;* + &#9399;* = &#9400;*
