[[!redirects hyper matrices]]
Hyper matrices are matrices consisting of matrices.  For example, an ordinary n X n matrix (A) would have either numbers or variable in the respective rows and columns.  An n X n hyper matrix (&#9398;) would have matrices instead of numbers in each of its entries for each row and column.

Most of the same rules apply to ordinary matrix operations that would apply to hyper matrix operations.  For instance, the 2 X 2 Hyper matrix (&#9398;) + the 
2 X 2 hyper matrix (&#9399;) would be A11 + B11 = C11 and A12 + B12 = C12.  A21 + B21 = C21 and A22 + B22 = C22.  And A11 + B11 = C11 would be a1111 + b1111 = c1111.  The first two numbers in the subscripts indicate the entries of the ordinary matrix and the last two numbers of the subscript indicate the entries of the hyper matrix.
