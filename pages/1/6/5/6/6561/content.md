## Idea

The [classification](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/SCFT#Classification) of [[superconformal field theories]] predicts the existence of such a theory with $(2,0)$-[[supersymmetry]] in [[dimension]] 6, which is such that it contains a [[self-dual higher gauge theory]] whose field configurations are [[connections on a 2-bundle]] (a [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle 2-bundle with connection]] in the abelian case).

It is expected ([Witten](#Witten07)) that such theories arise as the [[worldvolume]] theories of [[M5-brane]]s and that their compactifications are at the heart of the phenomenon that leads to [[S-duality]] and hence [[geometric Langlands duality]] ([Witten](#Witten09)).

Due to the [[self-dual higher gauge theory|self-duality]] a characterization of these theories by an [[action functional]] is at best subtle, maybe impossible. Therefore more direct descriptions are still under investigation (for instance [SSW11](#SSW11)). A review of recent developments is in ([Moore11](#Moore)).

## Properties

### Holographic dual

Under [[AdS-CFT|AdS7/CFT6]] the 6d $(2,0)$-superconformal QFT is supposed to be dual to [[11-dimensional supergravity|M-theory]] on [[anti de Sitter spacetime]] $AdS_7 \times S^4$.  

See [[AdS/CFT correspondence]] for more on this.

A proposal for related higher nonabelian differential form data is made in

 {#SSW11}

Since by [[transgression]] every nonabelian [[principal 2-bundle]]/[[gerbe]] gives rise to some kind of nonabelian 1-bundle on [[loop space]] it is clear that some parts (but not all) of the nonabelian gerbe theory on the 5-brane has an equivalent reformulation in terms of ordinary gauge theory on the [[loop space]] of the 5-brane and possibly for gauge group the [[loop group]] of the original gauge group. 

Comments along these lines have been made in 

* [[Andreas Gustavsson]], _Selfdual strings and loop space Nahm equations_ ([arXiv:0802.3456](http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.3456)).

In fact, via the [[strict 2-group]] version of the [[string 2-group]] there is a local gauge in which the loop group variables appear already before transgression of the 5-brane gerbe to loop space. This is discussed from a [[holographic principle|holographic]] point of view in
