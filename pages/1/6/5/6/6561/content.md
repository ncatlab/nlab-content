## Idea

According to the [classification of superconformal symmetry](supersymmetry#ClassificationSuperconformal), there should exists [[superconformal field theories]] in 6 dimensions...

[[!include superconformal symmetry -- table]]

...with $(2,0)$-[[supersymmetry]], that contain a [[self-dual higher gauge theory]] whose field configurations are [[connections on a 2-bundle]] (a [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle 2-bundle with connection]] in the abelian case).

In ([Claus-Kallosh-Proeyen 97](#ClausKalloshProeyen97)) such has been derived, in the abelian case and to low order, as the small fluctuations of the [[Green-Schwarz sigma-model]] of the [[M5-brane]] around the embedding in the [[asymptotic boundary]] of the [[AdS-spacetime]] that is the [[near-horizon geometry]] of the [[black brane|black]] M5-brane.

In accord with this the [AdS7-CFT6](AdS-CFT#AdS7CFT6) correspondence predicts that the nonabelian 6d theory is the corresponding theory for $N$ coincident M5-branes.

In the non-abelian case this is expected ([Witten 07](#Witten07)) that the compactification of such theories are at the heart of the phenomenon that leads to [[S-duality]] in [[super Yang-Mills theory]] and further to [[geometric Langlands duality]] ([Witten 09](#Witten09)).

Due to the [[self-dual higher gauge theory|self-duality]] a characterization of these theories by an [[action functional]] is subtle. Therefore more direct descriptions are still under investigation (for instance [SSW11](#SSW11)). A review of recent developments is in ([Moore11](#Moore)).

## Properties

### Geometric engineering
  {#GeometricEngineering}

For [[geometric engineering]] of the [[6d (2,0)-superconformal QFT]], see at _[duality between M-theory on Z2-orbifolds and type IIB string theory on K3-fibrations -- Geometric engineering of 6d (2,0)-SCFT](duality+between+M-theory+on+Z2-orbifolds+and+type+IIB+string+theory+on+K3-fibrations#GeometricEngineeringOfThe6d2SuperconformalQFT)_.


### Holographic dual

Under [[AdS-CFT|AdS7/CFT6]] the 6d $(2,0)$-superconformal QFT is supposed to be dual to [[11-dimensional supergravity|M-theory]] on [[anti de Sitter spacetime]] $AdS_7 \times S^4$.  

See [[AdS/CFT correspondence]] for more on this.


### Realization of quantum chromodynamics

See at _[[AdS-QCD correspondence]]_.

### Solitonic 1-branes

The 5d $(2,0)$-[[SCFT]] has tensionless 1-[[brane]] configurations. From the point of view of the ambient [[11-dimensional supergravity]] these are the boundaries of [[M2-branes]] ending on the [[M5-branes]]. ([GGT](#GGT))

The [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|compactification]] of the 5-brane on a [[Riemann surface]] yields as [[worldvolume]] [[theory (physics)|theory]] [[N=2 D=4 super Yang-Mills theory]]. See at _[N=2 D=4 SYM -- Construction by compactification of 5-branes](N%3D2+D%3D4+super+Yang-Mills+theory#ConstructionByCompactificationOf5Branes)_.

The _[[AGT correspondence]]_ relates  the [[partition function]] of $SU(2)^{n+3g-3}$-[[N=2 D=4 super Yang-Mills theory]] obtained by [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|compactifying]] the $6d$ M5-brane theory on a [[Riemann surface]] $C_{g,n}$ of [[genus]] $g$ with $n$ punctures to 2d [[Liouville theory]] on $C_{g,n}$. 

More generally, this kind of construction allows to describe the 6d (2,0)-theory as a "[[2d SCFT]] with values in [[super Yang-Mills theory|4d SYM]]". See at _[[AGT correspondence]]_ for more on this.


### Twistor space description

Famously the solutions to [[self-dual Yang-Mills theory]] in [[dimension]] 4 can be obtained as images of degree-2 cohomology classes under the [[Penrose-Ward twistor transform]]. Since the 6d QFT on the [[M5-brane]] contains a 2-form [[self-dual higher gauge field]] it seems natural to expect that it can be described by a higher analogy of the twistor transform. For references exploring this idea see at _[twistor space -- References -- Application to the self-dual 2-form field in 6d](twistor+space#ReferencesApplicationToSelfDual2FormField)_.

### Models and special properties
 {#ModelsAndSpecialProperties}

Realization of the 6d theory in [[F-theory]] is discussed in ([Heckmann-Morrison-Vafa 13](#HeckmannMorrisonVafa13)).

A proposal for related higher nonabelian differential form data is made in 


* {#SSW11} [[Henning Samtleben]], Ergin Sezgin, Robert Wimmer, _(1,0) superconformal models in six dimensions_ ([arXiv:1108.4060](http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.4060))
 

Since by [[transgression]] every nonabelian [[principal 2-bundle]]/[[gerbe]] gives rise to some kind of nonabelian 1-bundle on [[loop space]] it is clear that some parts (but not all) of the nonabelian gerbe theory on the 5-brane has an equivalent reformulation in terms of ordinary gauge theory on the [[loop space]] of the 5-brane and possibly for gauge group the [[loop group]] of the original gauge group. 

Comments along these lines have been made in 

* [[Andreas Gustavsson]], _Selfdual strings and loop space Nahm equations_ ([arXiv:0802.3456](http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.3456)).

In fact, via the [[strict 2-group]] version of the [[string 2-group]] there is a local gauge in which the loop group variables appear already before transgression of the 5-brane gerbe to loop space. This is discussed from a [[holographic principle|holographic]] point of view in

The argument that the abelian [[7d Chern-Simons theory]] of a [[circle n-bundle with connection|3-connection]] yields this way the [[conformal blocks]] of the abelian [[self-dual higher gauge theory]] of the 6d theory on a _single_ brane is due to
