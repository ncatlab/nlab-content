By the general rules of $(n,r)$-[[(n,r)-category|categories]], an __$(n,0)$-category__ is an $\infty$-[[infinity-category|category]] such that
*  any $j$-morphism is an [[equivalence]], for $j \gt 0$;
*  any two parallel $j$-morphisms are equivalent, for $j \gt n$.

You can start from any notion of $\infty$-category, strict or weak; up to [[equivalence of categories|equivalence]], the result is the same as an $n$-[[n-groupoid|groupoid]] with a corresponding level of strictness.
