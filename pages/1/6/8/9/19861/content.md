## Idea

Equivariant ordinary cohomology is the [[equivariant cohomology]]-version of [[ordinary cohomology]].

By default this is often understood to be the [[Borel equivariant cohomology]]-version of [[ordinary cohomology]], but more generally this must be understood as [[Bredon cohomology]], i.e. as the [[proper equivariant homotopy theory|proper-equivariant]] version of [[ordinary cohomology]].


## Properties

### Equivariant Chern character

There is a [[Chern character]] map from [[equivariant K-theory]] to [[equivariant ordinary cohomology]].

(e.g. [Stefanich](#Stefanich))
