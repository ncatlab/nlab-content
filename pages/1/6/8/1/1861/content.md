## Idea

Where [[homotopy groups]] are groups of [[homotopy classes]] of maps  out [[spheres]], $\pi_n(X)\coloneqq [S^n \to X]$, cohomotopy groups are groups of homotopy classes _into_ spheres, $\pi^n(X) \coloneqq [X \to S^n]$.

If instead one considers mapping into the [[stabilization]] of the spheres, hence into (some [[suspension spectrum|suspension]] of) the [[sphere spectrum]], then one speaks of _[[stable cohomotopy]]_. In other words, the [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] theory which is [[Brown representability theorem|represented]] by the [[sphere spectrum]] is _stable cohomotopy_.

In this vein, regarding terminology: the concept of [[cohomology]] (as discussed there) in the very general sense of [[non-abelian cohomology]], is about [[homotopy classes]] of maps _into_ any object $A$ (in some [[(âˆž,1)-topos]]). In this way, general non-abelian cohomology is sort of dual to homotopy, and hence might generally be called co-homotopy. This is the statement of _[[Eckmann-Hilton duality]]_. The duality between homotopy (groups) and co-homotopy proper may then be thought of as being the special case of this where $A$ is taken to be a sphere. 

## Properties

### Hopf degree theorem

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition
**([[Hopf degree theorem]])**

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ be a [[natural number]] and $X \in Mfd$ be a [[connected topological space|connected]] [[orientation|orientable]] [[closed manifold]] of [[dimension]] $n$. Then the $n$th [[cohomotopy]] classes $\left[X \overset{c}{\to} X^n\right] \in \pi^n(X)$ of $X$ are in [[bijection]] to the [[degree of a continuous function|degree]] $deg(c) \in \mathbb{Z}$ of the representing functions, hence the canonical function

$$
  \pi^n(X) 
    \underoverset{\simeq}{S^n \to K(\mathbb{Z},n)}{\longrightarrow}
   H^n(X,\mathbb{Z}) 
     \;\simeq\;   
   \mathbb{Z}
$$

from $n$th [[cohomotopy]] to $n$th [[integral cohomology]] is a [[bijection]].

### Relation to Freudenthal suspension theorem

relation to the [[Freudenthal suspension theorem]] ([Spanier 49, section 9](#Spanier49))

### Smooth representatives

For $X$ a [[compact topological space|compact]] [[smooth manifold]], there is a [[smooth function]] $X \to S^n$ representing every cohomotopy class (with respect to the standard [[smooth structure]] on the [[sphere]] [[manifold]]).

### Relation to cobordism classes of normally framed submanifolds
  {#RelationToCobordismGroup}

For $X$ a [[closed manifold|closed]] [[smooth manifold]] of [[dimension]] $D$, the [[Pontryagin-Thom construction]] (e.g. [Kosinski 93, IX.5](#Kosinski93)) identifies the [[set]] 

$$
  SubMfd_{/bord}^{d}(X)
$$

of [[cobordism classes]] of  [[closed manifold|closed]] and [[normally framed submanifolds]] $\Sigma \overset{\iota}{\hookrightarrow} X$ of [[dimension]] $d$ inside $X$ with the [[cohomotopy]] $\pi^{D-d}(X)$ of $X$ in degree $D- d$

$$
  SubMfd_{/bord}^{d}(X)
    \underoverset{\simeq}{PT}{\longrightarrow}
  \pi^{D-d}(X)
  \,.
$$

(e.g. [Kosinski 93, IX Theorem (5.5)](#Kosinski93))

In particular, by this [[bijection]] the canonical [[group]] [[structure]] on [[cobordism groups]] in sufficiently high [[codimension]] (essentially given by [[disjoint union]] of [[submanifolds]]) this way induces a group structure on the cohomotopy sets in sufficiently high degree.



This construction generalizes to [[equivariant cohomotopy]], see [there](equivariant+cohomotopy#PontryaginThomConstruction).

### Relation to configuration spaces
  {#RelationToConfigurationSpaces}


+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark
**([[configuration space (mathematics)|configuration spaces]] and [[twisted cohomology|twisted]] cohomotopy)**

The [[scanning map equivalence]] ([this Prop.](scanning+map#ScanningMapEquivalence)) identifies the [[configuration space]] of points in $X$ with labels in an [[n-sphere]] with the [[cocycle]]-space/-[[infinity-groupoid]] of $\tau_X$-[[twisted cohomology|twisted]] cohomotopy in degree $\tau + n$, where $\tau_X \coloneqq [S_X(T X)]$ is the class of the [[spherical fibration]] of the tangent bundle.

In particular if $X$ is a [[parallelizable manifold]]/[[framed manifold]], then $\tau_X = dim(X)$ and the equivalence identifies the [[configuration space]] with the plain cohomotopy of $X$ in degree $dim(X) + n$:

$$
  Conf(X,S^n)
  \;\simeq\;
  Maps( X, S^{dim(X) + n} )
  \,.
$$

## Examples

### Of 4-Manifolds
 {#On4Manifolds}

Let $X$ be a [[4-manifold]] which is [[connected topological space|connected]] and [[orientation|oriented]].

The [[Pontryagin-Thom construction]] as [above](#RelationToCobordismGroup) gives for $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ the [[commuting diagram]] of sets

$$
  \array{
     \pi^n(X) 
       &\overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}&
     \mathbb{F}_{4-n}(X)
     \\
     {}^{ \mathllap{h^n} }
     \downarrow
       &&
     \downarrow^{ h_{4-n} }
     \\
     H^n(X,\mathbb{Z})
       &\underset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}&
     H_{4-n}(X,\mathbb{Z})
     \,,
  }
$$

where $\pi^\bullet$ denotes cohomotopy sets, $H^\bullet$ denotes [[ordinary cohomology]], $H_\bullet$ denotes [[ordinary homology]] and $\mathbb{F}_\bullet$ is [[normal bundle|normally]] [[framing|framed]] [[cobordism classes]] of [[normal bundle|normally]] [[framing|framed]] [[submanifolds]]. Finally $h^n$ is the operation of pullback of the generating integral cohomology class on $S^n$ (by the nature of [[Eilenberg-MacLane spaces]]):

$$
  h^n(\alpha) \;\colon\; X \overset{\alpha}{\longrightarrow} S^n \overset{generator}{\longrightarrow} B^n \mathbb{Z}
  \,.
$$

Now 

* $h^0$, $h^1$, $h^4$ are [[isomorphisms]]

* $h^3$ is an isomorphism if $X$ is "odd" in that it contains at least one closed oriented [[surface]] of odd self-intersection, otherwise $h^3$ becomes an isomorphism on a $\mathbb{Z}/2$-[[quotient group]] of $\pi^3(X)$ (which is a group via the [[group]]-[[structure]] of the [[3-sphere]] ([[special unitary group|SU(2)]]))
