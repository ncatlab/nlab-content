## Idea

Where [[homotopy groups]] are groups of [[homotopy classes]] of maps  out [[spheres]], $\pi_n(X)\coloneqq [S^n \to X]$, cohomotopy groups are groups of homotopy classes _into_ spheres, $\pi^n(X) \coloneqq [X \to S^n]$.


## Relation to cohomology
The notion of [[cohomology]]  -- in its generalization beyond [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] to [[nonabelian cohomology]] -- is related by abstract [[duality]] to [[homotopy]]. In the [[(infinity,1)-topos]] [[Top]] this is traditionally called [[Eckmannâ€“Hilton duality]].

Therefore it does make sense to speak of general [[cohomology]] as **co-homotopy**.

Indeed, [[cohomology]] is a concept [[duality|dual]] to [[homology]] only in the very restrictive simple case of [[chain homology and cohomology]]. And this is really just because in this simple case it so happens that [[homotopy]] of [[chain complexes]] is their [[homology]]. 
This is part of the statement of the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]]: the [[nerve]] operation on [[chain complex]]es $N : Ch_+ \to SimpAb$ identifies  [[homology|chain homology groups]] with [[simplicial homotopy group]]s.

So on general grounds the word "cohomotopy" is actually better suited than "cohomology" for a concept of such fundamental importance. 

## Properties

* For $X$ a [[compact topological space|compact]] [[smooth manifold]], there is a [[smooth function]] $X \to S^n$ representing every cohomotopy class (with respect to the standard [[smooth structure]] on the [[sphere]] [[manifold]]).
