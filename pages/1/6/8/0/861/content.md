A **toset** is also known as a **totally ordered set** or **linearly ordered set**.   It is a [[poset]] such that the 'trichotomy axiom' holds.  The **trichotomy axiom** says that for any pair of elements $x$ and $y$, exactly one of these three alternatives holds:

* $x \lt y$

* $x = y $

* $x \gt y$
