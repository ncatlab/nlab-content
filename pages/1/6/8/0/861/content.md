A **toset** is also known as a **totally ordered set** or **linearly ordered set**.   It is a [[poset]] such that the 'trichotomy axiom' holds.  The **trichotomy axiom** says that for any pair of elements $x$ and $y$, exactly one of these three alternatives holds:
* $x \lt y$
* $x = y $
* $x \gt y$

Equivalently, and to avoid reference to the irreflexive relation $\lt$, demand that at least one of these alternatives hold:
* $x \le y$
* $x \ge y$

The latter definition is the one to use in [[constructivism|constructive mathematics]].  However, many posets that are classically totally ordered are still not totally ordered constructively, and one must instead work with a [[loset]].
