A **monoidal bicategory** is a [[bicategory]] with a [[monoidal category|monoidal structure]], which is up-to-equivalence in a suitable bicategorical sense.  A concise definition is that a monoidal bicategory is a [[tricategory]] with one object.  Just as every tricategory is equivalent to a [[Gray-category]], every monoidal bicategory is equivalent to a **Gray-monoid**, i.e. a monoid in the monoidal category [[Gray]].

Just as monoidal categories also come in [[braided monoidal category|braided]] and [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]] versions, monoidal bicategories have *three* extra levels of commutativity (see the [[periodic table]] and the [[stabilization hypothesis]]): braided, sylleptic, and symmetric.  Slightly different definitions of these various structures can be found in the following sequence of papers:

* Kapranov and Voevodsky, in "2-categories and Zamolodchikov tetrahedra equations" and "Braided monoidal 2-categories and Manin-Schechtman higher braid groups", defined *braided Gray monoids*, i.e. Gray-monoids with a braiding.

* [[John Baez|Baez]] and Neuchl, in "Higher-Dimensional Algebra I. Braided monoidal 2-categories" corrected the KV definition by adding one axiom.

* [[Brian Day|Day]] and [[Ross Street|Street]], in "Monoidal bicategories and Hopf algebroids," gave a definition of braided Gray-monoid equivalent to Baez-Neuchl, and also defined sylleptic and symmetric Gray-monoids and functors between them.

* [[Sjoerd Crans|Crans]], in "Generalized centers of braided and sylleptic monoidal 2-categories," further modified the definition by adding an axiom relating to the tensor unit.

* [[Paddy McCrudden|McCrudden]], in "Balanced coalgebroids," defined braided and sylleptic monoidal *bicategories* (not Gray monoids).
