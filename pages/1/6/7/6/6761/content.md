## Statement

The __representable functor theorem__ states that a [[Set]]-valued [[functor]] on a [[complete category]] is [[representable functor|representable]] if and only if it is [[continuous functor|continuous]] and has a [[solution set condition|solution set]].


## Related facts

As representable functors are ubiquitous, this theorem is essentially equivalent to the [[adjoint functor theorem]] and to theorems guaranteeing the existence of [[limits]].

Specifically, a continuous functor $C\to Set$
is a right adjoint functor if and only if it is representable, in which case the left adjoint functor $Set\to C$ sends the [[singleton]] set to the representing object
