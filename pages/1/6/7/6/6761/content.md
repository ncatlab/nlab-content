## Statement

The __representable functor theorem__ states that:

- A [[presheaf]] $C^{op} \to Set$ on a [[cocomplete category]] $C$ is [[representable functor|representable]] (i.e. of the form $C({-}, c)$ for some object $c \in C$) if and only if it sends [[colimits]] in $C$ to [[limits]] in $Set$ and has a [[solution set condition|solution set]].

Dually, the __corepresentable functor theorem__ states that:

- A [[copresheaf]] $C \to Set$ on a [[complete category]] $C$ is [[corepresentable functor|corepresentable]] (i.e. of the form $C(c, {-})$ for some object $c \in C$) if and only if it is [[continuous functor|continuous]] and has a [[solution set condition|solution set]].

## Related facts

As representable functors are closely connected to [[adjoint functors]], this theorem is essentially equivalent to the [[adjoint functor theorem]] and to theorems guaranteeing the existence of [[limits]].

Specifically, assuming that $C$ is [[copowered]] over [[Set]] (in particular, this is true if $C$ is [[cocomplete]]), a functor $C\to Set$
is a right adjoint functor if and only if it is representable, in which case the left adjoint functor $Set\to C$ sends the [[singleton]] set to the representing object, and more generally a set $X$ to the [[copower]] of $X$ with the representing object.
