* _Two dimensional sheaf theory_, J. Pure Appl. Algebra 23 (1982) 251-270

where the stacks are considered on a 2-site. A _2-site_ is a [[2-category]] with a Grothendieck 2-topology (compare [[Grothendieck topology]]), which is in turn defined in terms of 2-sieves (compare [[sieve]]). There is a Giraud-type theorem proved in this context. In a later article there were some errata mentioned. 

This should be related to the "$\infty$-dimensional sheaf theory" described at [[(infinity,1)-category of (infinity,1)-sheaves]], somehow. Compare also [[derived stack]].

_Zoran_: Could one define $(\infty,1)$-sieves somehow as subobjects (in quasi-category sense) of representables in enriched quasi-category setup ?
