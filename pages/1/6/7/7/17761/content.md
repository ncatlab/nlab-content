## Idea

The **order polynomial** $\Omega(P;n)$ of a finite [[partially ordered set]] $P$ counts the total number of [[order-preserving functions]] from $P$ into any [[linear order]] $\mathbf{n} = \{ 0 \lt 1 \lt \cdots \lt n-1 \}.$

## Definition

To see that
$$\Omega(P;n) = |Hom(P,\mathbf{n})|$$
defines a [[polynomial]] in $n$, first observe that any function $P \to \mathbf{n}$ factors as a [[surjection]] from $P$ onto some $\mathbf{k} = \{ 0 \lt 1 \lt \cdots \lt k-1 \}$ (where $k \le n$), followed by an [[injection]] from $\mathbf{k}$ to $\mathbf{n}$. The total number of order-preserving functions from $P$ to $\mathbf{n}$ can therefore be calculated explicitly as 
$$\Omega(P;n) = \sum_{k=1}^{|P|} e_k \binom{n}{k}$$
where $e_k$ is the number of surjective order-preserving functions from $P$ to $\mathbf{k}$. Hence $\Omega(P;n)$ is a polynomial of degree equal to the cardinality of $P$.

## Examples

The order polynomial of $\mathbf{3} = \{ 0 \lt 1 \lt 2 \}$ is
$$n + 2 \binom{n}{2} + \binom{n}{3} = \frac{n^3 + 3n^2 + 2n}{6}$$
For example, evaluating the polynomial at $n=3$ confirms that there are 10 order-preserving functions from $\mathbf{3}$ to itself.

The order polynomial of the 3-element poset
$$P = \array{&&c&& \\ &\nearrow& &\nwarrow& \\ a &&&& b}$$
is $n + 3 \binom{n}{2} + 2\binom{n}{3} = \frac{2n^3 + 3n^2 + n}{6}$.
Evaluating at $n=2$, we compute that there are 5 order-preserving functions from $P$ onto $\mathbf{2}$.

## Properties

The order polynomial is related to the [[zeta polynomial]] by the equation[^Note]
$$
\Omega(P;n+2) = Z(I(P);n)
$$
where $I(P) \cong [I(P),\mathbf{2}]$ is the lattice of [[lower sets]] in $P$.
This can be seen as a consequence of the isomorphisms
$$Hom(P, [n+1]) \cong Hom(P, [[n],[1]]) \cong Hom(P\times [n],[1]) \cong Hom([n], [P,[1]])$$
(where $[n] = \mathbf{n{+}1}$) applying the isomorphism $[n+1] \cong [[n],[1]]$ together with [[currying]].

[^Note]: Note that the definition we use for $Z(P;n)$ has an index shift from the definition that seems to be more standard in combinatorics (see the footnote at [[zeta polynomial]]), so this equation is sometimes expressed as $\Omega(P;n) = Z(I(P);n)$.
