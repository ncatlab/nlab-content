### Idea

**Ultracategories** are [[categories]] endowed with [[extra structure]] meant to abstract the possibility of forming [[ultraproducts]]. They were introduced by [Makkai](#Makkai87) in order to prove [[conceptual completeness | strong conceptual completeness]] for [[coherent logic]], thus allowing to reconstruct a coherent theory from its category of [[models]]. 

\begin{theorem}[Makkai]\label{thm:makkai}
Let $P$ be a small [[pretopos]] and let $\operatorname{Mod}(P) = \mathbf{Pretop}(P, Set)$ be its category of models. Then, the evaluation functor
\[ ev : P \to \mathbf{Ult} ( \operatorname{Mod}(P) , Set ) \]
is an [[equivalence of categories]], where $\mathbf{Ult}$ is the [[2-category ]] of ultracategories, ultrafunctors, and transformations thereof.
\end{theorem}

To provide intuition on ultracategories, let's start by recalling that a [[compact Hausdorff space]] $K$ can be seen as a [[relational beta-module | relational $\beta$-module ]] where each [[ultrafilter]] $\mu$ on $K$ [[convergence | converges]] to a unique _limit_, namely the unique point $x \in K$ such that every open neighborhood of $x$ in $K$ lies in $\mu$, so as to determine a function $\beta K \to K$. More generally, we can say that a function $f \colon I \to K$ for some set $I$ _converges_ with respect to some ultrafilter $\mu$ on $I$ to the limit of the ultrafilter $f_*(\mu) = \{ S \subseteq K | f^{-1}(K) \in \mu\}$, i.e. the unique point $x \in K$ such that every open neighborhood of $x$ in $K$ contains a $\mu$-large subset of values of $f$. This way, the convergence relation on $K$ can be seen as a family of functions 
\[ K^I \times \beta I \to K\]
for each set $I$: in the same spirit, an _ultrastructure_ (called _pre-ultracategory_ in [Makkai](#Makkai)) on a category $\mathcal{M}$ is given at its core by a family of [[functors]]
\[ \mathcal{M}^I \times \beta I \to \mathcal{M} \]
satisfying some axioms. Different, inequivalent, choices are possible for the precise axiomatization: most notably, [Lurie](#Lurie)'s definition of ultracategories (together with the introduction of new morphisms between them) allowed to extend Makkai's result to a reconstruction theorem for [[coherent toposes]], and it formalizes the idea that ultracategories categorify compact Hausdorff spaces (see [Lurie, Thm 3.1.5](#Lurie)).

\begin{theorem}[Lurie]\label{thm:lurie}
Let $P$ be a small pretopos and let $\mathcal{E} = Sh(P)$ be its coherent topos of sheaves. Then, the evaluation functor $ev : P \to \mathbf{Ult}^L (\operatorname{Mod}(P) , Set )$ induces an equivalence 
\[ \mathcal{E} \simeq \mathbf{Ult}^L ( \operatorname{Mod}(P) , Set ) \]
where $\mathbf{Ult}^L$ is the $2$-category of ultracategories, left ultrafunctors, and transformations thereof. In particular, $ev$ is an equivalence $P \simeq \mathbf{Ult} (\operatorname{Mod}(P) , Set )$, where $\mathbf{Ult}$ is the [[locally full sub-2-category]] of $\mathbf{Ult}^L$ determined by ultrafunctors.
\end{theorem}

Lurie's axiomatization was proved by [Hamad](#Hamad) to coincide with that of [[colax algebra | normal colax algebras]] for a [[pseudomonad]] on the 2-category of locally small categories. [Tarantino and Wrigley](#TarWrig) weakened Lurie's definition to obtain an axiomatization of ultracategories sharing the same properties, but emerging universally from the [[ultrafilter monad]] by means of a kind of [[ Kan extensionÂ ]]. Instead, [Saadia](#Saadia) and [Hamad](#HamadGen) independently introduced _virtual ultracategories_ as a [[generalized multicategory | multicategorical]] generalization of ultracategories which allows to extend Lurie's result to [[point of a topos | toposes with enough points]]; the former, in particular, introduces yet another axiomatization of ultracategories, satisfying the same reconstruction theorem above, as a particular case of virtual ultracategories. If ultracategories categorify compact Hausdorff spaces, _virtual_ ultracategories categorify all topological spaces, allowing for maps into an abstract ultraproduct which may not exist in the underlying category.
