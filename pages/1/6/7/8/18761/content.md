## Idea

In the [[Lagrangian field theory]] of the [[Dirac field]], the _Dirac current_ is a [[conserved current]] whose interpretation is literally the current of the [[spinor]] [[particles]] that are the [[quanta]] of the Dirac field. Therefore the corresponding [[charge]] is _fermion number_. As such the Dirac current (or rather its chiral version) plays a key role for instance in [[baryogenesis]].

The Dirac current is the [[conserved current]] which is associated via [[Noether's theorem|Noether's theorem I]] to the [[infinitesimal symmetry of the Lagrangian]] given by multiplying the [[Dirac field]] by a complex phase.

## Definition

In the usual standard coordinates, the Dirac current is of the form 

$$
  \overline{\psi}\gamma^\mu \psi \, \iota_{\partial_\mu} dvol_\Sigma
   \;\in\;
   \Omega^{p,0}
   \,.
$$
