An aleph (&#8501;) is the [[cardinality]] of an [[infinite set|infinite]] [[well-ordered set|well-ordered]] (or well-orderable) [[set]].  Assuming the [[axiom of choice]] (in the guise of the [[well-ordering theorem]]), every [[cardinal number]] is either a [[natural number]] or an aleph.

The alephs are themselves well-ordered; for an [[ordinal number]] $\mu$, we denote the $\mu$th aleph as $\aleph_\mu$.

In particular $\aleph_0$ is the the cardinality of the set of [[natural numbers]].
