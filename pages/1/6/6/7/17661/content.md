__G. H. Hardy__ (Godfrey Harold Hardy) was a remarkable 20th British mathematical analysist and analytic number theorist in first half of 20th century. In addition to important works of his own, he is well known as proponent of rigorous analysis and pure mathematics in Great Britain which was at the time dominated by so-called [[applied mathematics]], for his fruitful collaborations with Littlewood and Ramanujan and for some influential books including the one on divergent series ([[resummation]] methods) and the popular book "A mathematician's apology" about the mathematical profession and the reasons of mathematicians.
