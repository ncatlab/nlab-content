## Idea

A **Conduch&#233; functor**, also called a **Conduch&#233; fibration** or an **exponentiable functor**, is a [[functor]] which is an [[exponentiable morphism]] in [[Cat]].  (In accordance with [[Stigler's law of eponymy]], the notion was actually defined in [Giraud 64](#Giraud64) before [Conduch&#233; 72](#Conduche72).)  This turns out to be equivalent to a certain "factorization lifting" property which includes both [[Grothendieck fibrations]] and opfibrations.

So, roughly speaking, a functor $p\colon E\to B$ is a **strict Conduch&#233; functor** if given any morphism $\alpha$ in $E$, and any way of factoring its image in $B$, we can lift that factorization back up to a factorization of $\alpha$, in a way that is unique up to isomorphism.   There is also a weak version of this idea.

## Failure of local cartesian closedness in Cat

As is evident from the fact that such functors have a name, not every functor is exponentiable in [[Cat]].  In particular, although $Cat$ is [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]], it is not [[locally cartesian closed category|locally cartesian closed]].

It is easy to write down examples of [[colimits]] in $Cat$ that are not preserved by [[pullback]] (as they would be if pullback had a [[right adjoint]]).  For instance, let $\mathbf{2}$ denote the [[walking arrow]], i.e. the [[ordinal]] $2$ regarded as a [[category]], $1$ the [[terminal category]], and $\mathbf{3} = \mathbf{2} \sqcup_1 \mathbf{2}$ the ordinal $3 = (a \to b \to c)$ regarded as a category.  Then the [[pushout]] square
$$\array{1 & \overset{}{\to} & \mathbf{2}\\
  \downarrow && \downarrow\\
  \mathbf{2}& \underset{}{\to} & \mathbf{3}}$$
in the [[slice category]] $Cat/\mathbf{3}$ pulls back along the inclusion $\mathbf{2}\to \mathbf{3}$ of the arrow $(a\to c)$ to the square
$$\array{0 & \overset{}{\to} & 1\\
  \downarrow && \downarrow\\
  1& \underset{}{\to} & \mathbf{2}}$$
which is certainly not a pushout.

One way to describe the problem is that the pushout has "created new morphisms" that didn't exist before.  But another way to describe the problem is that the inclusion $\mathbf{2}\to\mathbf{3}$ fails to notice that the morphism $(a\to c)$ acquires a new factorization in $\mathbf{3}$ which it didn't have in $\mathbf{2}$.  Conduch&#233;'s observation was that this latter failure is really the only problem that can prevent a functor from being exponentiable.

## Definition

A [[functor]] $p\colon E\to B$ is a **strict Conduch&#233; functor** if for any [[morphism]] $\alpha\colon a\to b$ in $E$ and any factorization $p a \overset{\beta}{\to} c \overset{\gamma}{\to} p b$ of $p \alpha$ in $B$, we have:

1. there exists a factorization $a \overset{\tilde{\beta}}{\to} d \overset{\tilde{\gamma}}{\to} b$ of $\alpha$ in $E$ such that $p \tilde{\beta} = \beta$ and $p \tilde{\gamma} = \gamma$, and

1. any two such factorizations in $E$ are connected by a [[zigzag]] of commuting morphisms which map to $id_c$ in $B$.

(Here, 'commuting morphism' means a morphism $d \to d'$ in $E$ such that the pair of triangles in 

$$\array{
 & & d & \stackrel{\tilde{\gamma}}{\to} & b \\
 & ^\mathllap{\tilde{\beta}} \nearrow & \downarrow & \nearrow^\mathrlap{\tilde{\gamma}'} & \\
a & \underset{\tilde{\beta}'}{\to} & d' & & 
}$$

[[commuting diagram|commute]].) 

The theorem is then that the following are equivalent:

* $p$ is a strict Conduch&#233; functor.
* $p$ is [[exponentiable morphism|exponentiable]] in the 1-category $Cat$.
* $p$ is exponentiable in the [[strict 2-category]] $Cat$.

By "exponentiable in the strict 2-category $Cat$" we mean that pullback along $p$ has a strict right 2-adjoint (i.e.&#160;a $Cat$-enriched right adjoint).  Of course, this implies ordinary exponentiability in the 1-category $Cat$, while the converse follows via an argument involving [[cotensors]] with $\mathbf{2}$ in $Cat$.

For exponentiability in the weak [[2-category]] $Cat$, in the sense of pullback having a weak/pseudo 2-adjoint, we can simply weaken the condition.  We say that $p\colon E\to B$ is a **(weak) Conduch&#233; functor** if for any morphism $\alpha\colon a\to b$ in $E$ and any factorization $p a \overset{\beta}{\to} c \overset{\gamma}{\to} p b$ of $p \alpha$ in $B$, we have:

1. there exists a factorization $a \overset{\tilde{\beta}}{\to} d \overset{\tilde{\gamma}}{\to} b$ of $\alpha$ in $E$, and an isomorphism $p d \cong c$, such that modulo this isomorphism $p \tilde{\beta} = \beta$ and $p \tilde{\gamma} = \gamma$, and

1. any two such factorizations in $E$ are connected by a zigzag of commuting morphisms which map to isomorphisms in $B$.

A functor can then be shown to be a weak Conduch&#233; functor if and only if it is exponentiable in the weak sense in $Cat$.


## Conduch&#233; functors and 2-functors to Prof

The Conduch&#233; criterion can be reformulated in a more conceptual way by analogy with [[Grothendieck fibrations]].  We first observe that to give a functor $p\colon E\to B$ is essentially the same as to give a [[normal lax functor|normal]] [[lax 2-functor]] $B\to Prof$ from $B$ to [[Prof]], the 2-category of [[profunctors]].  The latter is also known as a [[displayed category]]; see there for more on this correspondence.

Specifically, given a functor $p$, we define $B\to Prof$ as follows.  Each object $b\in B$ is sent to the fiber category $p^{-1}(b)$ of objects lying over $b$ and morphism lying over $1_b$.  And each morphism $f\colon a\to b$ in $B$ to the profunctor $H_f\colon p^{-1}(a) &#8696; p^{-1}(b)$ for which $H_f(x,y)$ is the set of arrows $x\to y$ in $E$ lying over $f$.  The lax structure maps $H_f \otimes H_g \to H_{g f}$ are given by composition in $E$.  The converse construction of a functor $p$ from a normal lax 2-functor into $Prof$ is an evident generalization of the [[Grothendieck construction]].  Now we can say that:

* $p$ is a fibration iff the corresponding functor $B\to Prof$ factors through a pseudo 2-functor landing in $Cat^{op}$, via the contravariant inclusion $Cat^{op}\to Prof$.
* Similarly, $p$ is an opfibration iff $B\to Prof$ factors through a pseudo 2-functor landing in $Cat$ via the covariant inclusion $Cat \to Prof$.
* The functor $B\to Prof$ factors through a *lax* 2-functor landing in $Cat^{op}$ iff $p$ admits all "weakly cartesian" liftings, and dually.
* Finally, $p$ is a (strict) Conduch&#233; functor iff the functor $B\to Prof$ is itself a pseudo 2-functor (though it may not land in $Cat$ or $Cat^{op}$).  This can be seen by comparing the definition of the tensor product of profunctors with the explicit description in terms of unique factorizations above.

Thus Conduch&#233; functors into $B$ correspond to pseudofunctors from $B$, regarded as a locally discrete bicategory, to the bicategory $Prof$.  However, morphisms between Conduch&#233; functors over $B$ do not correspond to pseudonatural transformations between such pseudofunctors.  To get the correct transformations, we must instead regard $B$ as a vertically discrete [[double category]], and $Prof$ as a pseudo double category with profunctors horizontally and functors vertically; then pseudo double functors $B\to Prof$ again correspond to Conduch&#233; functors into $B$, and *vertical* double transformations between them correspond to functors between Conduch&#233; functors into $B$.

More generally, the slice category $Cat/B$ is equivalent to the hom-category $Dbl_{normal,lax}(B,Prof)$, with its full subcategory consisting of Conduch&#233; functors corresponding to the pseudo double functors.

## Higher-categorical versions

Non-strict Conduch&#233; functors and [[Street fibrations]] may be equivalently characterized by an "up-to-iso" version of the above constructions using [[essential fibers]].

[Ayala and Francis](#AyalaFrancis) prove an analogous characterization of exponentiable [[(∞,1)-functors]].  The [[(∞,1)-category theory|(∞,1)-categorical context]] eliminates the "level-shifting" in the characterization via $Prof$ (i.e. the presence of a [[bicategory]] [[Prof]] when discussing only exponentiable 1-functors).  Thus, there is an [[(∞,1)-category]] [[(∞,1)Prof]] such that exponentiable $(\infty,1)$-functors into an $(\infty,1)$-category $B$ correspond to $(\infty,1)$-functors $B\to (\infty,1)Prof$.

As in the 1-categorical case, ordinary $(\infty,1)$-transformations between functors $B\to (\infty,1)Prof$ do not give the correct maps between exponentiable $(\infty,1)$-functors over $B$; we need to instead regard $(\infty,1)Prof$ as a sort of "$(\infty,1)$-double category".  Ayala and Francis consider only the vertically-invertible fragment of this $(\infty,1)$-double category, which can be represented as a functor from an $\infty$-groupoid to an $(\infty,1)$-category (a sort of [[proarrow equipment]] with all 2-cells and all 1-cells in the domain invertible); this is what they call a "flagged" $(\infty,1)$-category and is also what is represented by a non-complete [[Segal space]].  Of course, restricting to the vertically-invertible fragment of $(\infty,1)Prof$ also restricts what it classifies to the $\infty$-groupoid of exponentiable $(\infty,1)$-functors over $B$ rather than the whole $(\infty,1)$-category thereof.

## Examples

* The above considerations show that any Grothendieck fibration *or* opfibration is a (strict) Conduch&#233; functor, while any [[Street fibration]] or opfibration is a non-strict Conduch&#233; functor.

* If $\mathbf{2}$ denotes the [[interval category]], then any [[normal lax functor]] out of $\mathbf{2}$ is necessarily pseudo, since there are no composable pairs of nonidentity arrows in $\mathbf{2}$.  It follows that, as pointed out by Jean Benabou, *any* functor with codomain $\mathbf{2}$ is a Conduch&#233; functor.  Note that functors with codomain $\mathbf{2}$ can also be identified with [[profunctors]], the two fiber categories being the source and target of the corresponding profunctor.

* As with [[exponentiable morphisms]] in any category, Conduch&#233; functors are closed under composition.
