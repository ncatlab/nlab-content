The $(k,n)$-**hypersimplex** is a convex [[polytope]] $\Delta(k, n)$ (or $\Delta_{k,n}$) in $\mathbb{R}^n$ which is the [[convex hull]] of the $\left(\array{n \\ k}\right)$ points $e_{i_1}\lt e_{i_2}\lt \ldots \lt e_{i_n}$, where the $e_{j}$, are the standard basis vectors. $\Delta(k,n)$ may be seen as a convex hull of the [[barycenter]]s of the $(k-1)$-dimensional faces of $a (n-1)$-dimensional [[simplex]]. Special cases, $\Delta(1,n)$ and $\Delta(n-1,n)$ are themselves simplices of dimension $(n-1)$.  

The combinatorics of hypersimplices extends the combinatorics of distinguished triangles and octahedra in the standard [[triangulated categories]]; in fact they are postulated in [[Georges Maltsiniotis|Maltsiniotis]]'s strong version of a triangulated category. The [[octahedron]] is a $(2,4)$-hypersimplex. Higher hypersimplices were indeed obtained from $A_\infty$-enrichments by [[Volodymyr Lyubashenko]], so one could expect that they can also be obtained from the homotopy category of a [[stable (∞,1)-category]]. There are also connections between distinguished hypersimplices and [[Postnikov system|Postnikov towers]] in triangulated categories.
