The $(k,n)$-**hypersimplex** is a convex polytope $\Delta(k, n)$ (or $\Delta_{k,n}$) in $\mathbb{R}^n$ which is the convex hull of the $\left(\array{n \\ k}\right)$ points $e_{i_1}\lt e_{i_2}\lt \ldots \lt e_{i_n}$, where the $e_{j}$, are the standard basis vectors. $\Delta(k,n)$ may be seen as a convex hull of the [[barycenter]]s of the $(k-1)$-dimensional faces of $a (n-1)$-dimensional simplex. Special cases, $\Delta(1,n)$ and $\Delta(n-1,n)$ are themselves simplices of dimension $(n-1)$.  

The combinatorics of hypersimplices prolongs the combinatorics of distinguished triangles and octahedra in the standard [[triangulated categories]]; in fact they are postulated in [[Georges Maltsiniotis|Maltsiniotis]]'s strong version of a triangulated category. The octahedron is a $(2,4)$-simplex. Higher hypersimplices were indeed obtained from an $A_\infty$-enrichments by [[Volodymyr Lyubashenko]], so one could excpect that they can also be obtained on the homotopy category of a stable $(\infty,1)$-category. There are also connections of distinguished hypersimplices and [[Postnikov system|Postnikov towers]] in triangulated categories.
