#Definition#

A _simplicial set_  is a [[presheaf]] on the [[simplicial category]] $\Delta$.

#Remarks#

* The definition is to be understood from the point of view of [[space and quantity]]: a _simplicial set_ is a space characterized by the fact that and how it may be _probed_ by mapping standard simplices into it: the set $S_n$ assigned by a simplicial set to the standard $n$-simplex $[n]$ is the set of $n$-simplicies in this space, hence the way of mapping a standard $n$-simplex into this spaces.

* Simplicial sets generalize the idea of [[simplicial complex]]: a simplicial set can be thought of as something consisting of a set of $n$-simplices for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.
