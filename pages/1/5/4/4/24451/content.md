## Idea

A generalization of [[associative quasigroup]] to [[n-ary operation]]s. 

## Definition

Given a natural number $n$, an $n$-ary group is a set $S$ that both an [[n-ary semigroup]] and an [[n-ary quasigroup]]. 

\begin{remark}
A binary group is *not* a [[group]]. Binary groups are [[associative quasigroups]], as they can be empty. 
\end{remark}

## Properties

\begin{definition}
An *n-ary identity element* is an element $e$ such that any string of $n$ elements consisting of all $e$'s, apart from one place, is mapped to the element at that place. 
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
Every n-ary group with an n-ary identity element is a group, with the n-ary group operation being simply repeated application of a group's binary operation. 
\end{theorem}

\begin{remark}
The above theorem is why most authors typically do not require the existence of $n$-ary identity elements in the definition of $n$-ary groups, and why binary groups are just associative quasigroups. 
\end{remark}
