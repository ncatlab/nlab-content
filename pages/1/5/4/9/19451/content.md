## Idea

A *lax monoidal category* is a [[monoidal category]] in which the [[associator]]- and [[unitor]]-[[natural transformation|transformations]] are not required to be [[invertible morphism|invertible]], i.e. are not required to be [[natural isomorphisms]] (as they are for ordinary [[monoidal categories]]).  

In this case there needs to be made a choice in which direction these structure morphisms go. The the opposite of the "evident" direction pne speaks of *oplac monoidal categories*.

## Overview of variations

For ordinary monoidal categories, the [[biased]] and unbiased definitions coincide up to equivalence (though this is a nontrivial [[coherence theorem]]), but in the lax and oplax cases this is no longer true.  Moreover, in the biased cases we can make independent choices of the directions of various of the morphisms.  This yields the following variations (in all cases we omit the coherence axioms for now):

* An **unbiased lax monoidal category** has $n$-ary tensor products $(a_1\otimes \cdots\otimes a_n)$ for all $n\ge 0$, including a 0-ary unit $I = ()$, and generalized associativity maps such as

  $$((a\otimes b\otimes c) \otimes () \otimes (d\otimes e)) \to (a\otimes b\otimes c\otimes d\otimes e)$$

  and a unit map $a\to (a)$.  It is **(strictly) normal** if the later is an isomorphism (identity).  It is a special case of a [[lax algebra for a 2-monad]].  

* Dually, an **unbiased oplax monoidal category** has generalized associativity maps in the opposite direction

  $$(a\otimes b\otimes c\otimes d\otimes e) \to ((a\otimes b\otimes c) \otimes () \otimes (d\otimes e))$$

  and a unit map $(a) \to a$.  It is a special case of an oplax algebra for a 2-monad.

* A **left-biased lax monoidal category** has a binary tensor product $a\otimes b$, a unit $I$, and constraints

  $$(a\otimes b)\otimes c\to a \otimes (b\otimes c) \qquad I \otimes a\to a \qquad a\otimes I\to a $$

* A **right-biased lax monoidal category** has a binary tensor product $a\otimes b$, a unit $I$, and constraints

  $$a \otimes (b\otimes c) \to (a\otimes b)\otimes c \qquad I \otimes a\to a \qquad a\otimes I\to a $$

* A **left-biased oplax monoidal category** has a binary tensor product $a\otimes b$, a unit $I$, and constraints

  $$(a\otimes b)\otimes c\to a \otimes (b\otimes c) \qquad a\to I \otimes a \qquad a\to a\otimes I $$

* A **right-biased oplax monoidal category** has a binary tensor product $a\otimes b$, a unit $I$, and constraints

  $$a \otimes (b\otimes c) \to (a\otimes b)\otimes c \qquad a\to I \otimes a \qquad a\to  a\otimes I $$

* A **left-skew monoidal category** has a binary tensor product $a\otimes b$, a unit $I$, and constraints

  $$(a\otimes b)\otimes c\to a \otimes (b\otimes c) \qquad  I \otimes a\to a \qquad a\to a\otimes I $$

* A **right-skew monoidal category** has a binary tensor product $a\otimes b$, a unit $I$, and constraints

  $$a \otimes (b\otimes c) \to (a\otimes b)\otimes c \qquad a\to I \otimes a \qquad a\otimes I\to a $$

Terminologically, note that we use "right" and "left" to indicate the direction of the biased associator, while the direction of the unitors is indicated by "lax" or "oplax" (if they are in the same direction) or "skew" (if they are in different directions).

The relationship between these concepts is summarised in the following table.

| If $V$ is a ___ monoidal category then... | $V^{rev}$ is... | $V^{op}$ is... | $V^{rev,op}$ is... |
|-----------------------|-------|------|--------------|
| left-biased lax | right-biased lax | right-biased oplax | left-biased oplax |
| right-biased lax | left-biased lax | left-biased oplax | right-biased oplax |
| left-biased oplax | right-biased oplax | right-biased lax | left-biased lax |
| right-biased oplax | left-biased oplax | left-biased lax | right-biased lax |
| left-skew | right-skew | right-skew | left-skew |
| right-skew | left-skew | left-skew | right-skew |

In other words, [[reverse monoidal category|$rev$]] and [[opposite category|$op$]] always swap direction; whilst $op$ interchanges lax and oplax (and has no effect on skew-monoidal categories).

There are two other possibilities, in which the definitions of left-skew and right-skew monoidal category are modified so that the associator is reversed, but they seem not to have been studied.

This use of "lax" and "oplax" in the biased case is justified by the fact that *biased (op)lax monoidal categories are a special case of unbiased ones*, with the $n$-ary tensor products defined in terms of the binary one by left- or right-associativity.  The unbiased structures arising in this way can be characterized as those in which certain generalized associativities are identities (or, up to equivalence, isomorphisms).

## Definitions

The above definitions are complete except for the coherence axioms.  In the unbiased case these can be deduced from the general notion of lax algebra.  In the biased cases, the axioms are roughly the same as those in MacLane's original definition of monoidal category: one pentagon, three unit triangles, and one unit-unit axiom.  (Kelly's later reduction of these to one pentagon and one unit triangle relies on invertibility of the constraints.)  In all cases it is possible to orient all of these axioms so as to make sense.

## Normalisation

\begin{theorem}
**([Lack and Street 2014](#LS14), Theorem 8.1)**
The inclusion of right-normal left-skew monoidal categories (i.e. those for which the right unitor is invertible) and [[lax monoidal functors]] into left-skew monoidal categories admits a partial right [[pseudoadjoint]], defined on those skew  monoidal categories with [[reflexive coequalisers]] preserved by tensoring on the right, sending a skew monoidal category $C$ to the skew monoidal category $C^I$ of $I$-[[modules]].
\end{theorem}

Consequently, any skew monoidal category with such coequalisers may be replaced by a right-normal skew monoidal category with the same monoids.

## Related notions

First note that all kinds of lax monoidal categories can be generalized to **lax monoids** in a [[monoidal bicategory]].  Using this generalization, we can make connections to many other kinds of monoidal structures:

* Oplax monoidal categories (i.e. oplax monoids in [[Cat]]) can be identified with [[multicategories]] that are "weakly representable".

* Multicategories themselves are precisely lax monoids in [[Span]], and also normal lax monoids in [[Prof]].

* We obtain various kinds of lax [[promonoidal category]] by working in [[Prof]] instead of [[Cat]].

* In particular, non-unital [[closed categories]] can be defined as biased lax monoids in [[Prof]] whose multiplication is corepresentable in the first argument and whose left unitor is invertible.  If the identity is also representable, we obtain a (unital) closed category.  The identification of biased lax monoids with particular unbiased ones thereby specializes to the identification of closed categories with closed multicategories.

* Just as the [[delooping]] of a [[monoidal category]] is a [[bicategory]], so too is the delooping of a skew-monoidal category a **skew-bicategory**.
