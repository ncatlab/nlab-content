## Idea

In the context of [[arithmetic geometry]] a _regulator_ is a certain map from [[algebraic K-theory]] to suitable [[ordinary cohomology]] used in the study of [[L-functions]] for instance in the context of the [[Bloch-Kato conjecture]].

The simplest example of such regulators are

* the [[analytic class number formula]];

* the [[Dedekind zeta-function]] of $K$;

* the [[Dirichlet regulator]] map from $K_1(R) = R^\times$ to a certain real vector space.

Then there is The Borel regulator and generally Beilinson's regulators (...)

These regulators can be understood to be essentially the [[Chern characters]] in [[algebraic K-theory]] ([Tamme 12](#Tamme12)), which has a particularly natural construction in [[differential algebraic K-theory]] ([Bunke-Tamme 12](#BunkeTamme12))

Various defs of motivic cohomology: K-theory,  analogous to Atiyah (see Atiyah: K-theory). Higher Chow groups. Voevodsky's complexes. Suslin-Friedlander??? Homotopical def. 

Scholl and Deninger defines motivic cohom with rational coeffs and Z subscript as the just the motivic cohom for q>p, and as the image of motivic cohom of a proper regular model. Conjecturally this is equiv to defining it in the latter way for all p,q.

Deligne cohomology should be interpreted as Exts in a cat of mixed Hodge structures (see Scholl-Den section 2.9)

Deligne cohomology relates to Betti and de Rham cohomology through a certain les, and also via 2 ses's. (Sch-Den p 3) so it seems like somehow we encode the period map, or some aspect of it, in the Deligne cohomology groups with Q-structure. For open varieties the naive def gives in general infinite-dimensional groups, must refine a little...

Bloch has a construction of the regulator, using higher Chow groups. This is briefly explained in Deninger-Scholl, section 2.8. Same construction works for continuous etale cohomology.

Abstract Chern class theory explained in Schneider. Relate this to oriented theories maybe.

Explain the regulator as a realization map.

The idea of defining the regulator on the level of complexes, or on the level of representing spectra.

We develop differential algebraic K-theory of regular and separated schemes
of finite type over Spec(Z). Our approach is based on a new construction of a
functorial, spectrum level Beilinson regulator using differential forms. We
construct a cycle map which represents differential algebraic K-theory classes
by geometric vector bundles. As an application we derive Lott's relation
between short exact sequences of geometric bundles with a higher analytic
torsion form.
