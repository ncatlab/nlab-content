[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: Hi [[Andrew Stacey|Andrew]]. One question: I forget if we and in particular you ever finished proving or disproving the conjecture that Fr&#246;licher spaces are precisely the Isbell self-dual presheaves? Can you remind me of what the status of this idea is? If you had a full proof of this, it would definitely deserve to be stated here (unless top secret, of course.)

[[Andrew Stacey|Andrew]]: Hi [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]].  In my mind the proof was complete.  Whether or not I communicated that to you (plural) is moot.  One of my goals for this page is to gather and straighten out things like that.

[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: Ah, that's really good to hear. I'd think this will be the best selling point for the relevance of Fr&#246;licher spaces from a general abstract point of view. I'll see if I find the time to add an entry [[Isbell duality]] accompanying [[duality]] and [[dualizing object]] and [[space and quantity]], so that you can refer to it here.
