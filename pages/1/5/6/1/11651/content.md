## Idea

In [[algebraic geometry]] a _divisor_ (or _[[Weil divisor]]_ for definiteness) in a given [[variety]] is a [[formal linear combination]] of sub-[[varieties]] of [[codimension]] 1. Accordingly the _divisor group_ is the [[free abelian group]] on the set of subvarieties of codimension 1.

A divisor is called _effective_ if all its [[coefficients]] are [[positive numbers]].

In [[complex analytic geometry]] any [[meromorphic function]] induces a divisor whose summands are irreducible codimension-1 subvarieties weighted by the order of the [[poles]] of the function on that subvariety. Divisors arising this way are called _principal divisors_. More generally in [[algebraic geometry]] this leads to the concept of _[[Cartier divisor]]_.

Two divisors are called _linearly equivalent_ if their difference is a principal divisor.

## Properties

### Relation to line bundles and the Picard group

Under suitable conditions the [[Poincaré duality|Poincaré dual]] of a divisor may hence define the [[first Chern class]] of an [[algebraic line bundle]] and this construction yields group homomorphism from the group of divisors to the [[Picard group]]. After quotienting out linear equivalence of divisors this yields an inclusion and in complex geometry this inclusion exhibits precisely the subgroup of the [[Picard group]] of [[holomorphic line bundle]] which admit at least one global holomorphic section ([e.g. Huybrechts 04, cor. 2.3.20](#Huybrechts04)).
