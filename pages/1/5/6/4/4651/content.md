## Definition

A _matrix Lie algebra_ is the [[Lie algebra]] that is canonically a sub-Lie algebra of the [[general linear algebra]] $Mat(n) = \mathfrak{gl}(n)$ of $n \times n$ [[matrices]].

See also [[matrix Lie group]].


## Properties

By **Ado's theorem**, every finite-[[dimension]]al Lie algebra over a [[field]] of [[characteristic]] zero is a matrix Lie algebra. A similar statement fails for [[Lie groups]]. Ado's theorem has been used as a major step in the traditional proofs of the [[Lie's three theorems|Cartan–Lie theorem]] on the existence of [[Lie integration|integration of Lie algebras]] to Lie groups.
