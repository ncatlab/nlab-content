A _matrix Lie algebra_ is a [[Lie algebra]] associate with an  [[associative algebra]] that is a subalgebra of an algebra of [[matrices]] $Mat(n)$.

By Ado's theorem, every finite-dimensional Lie algebra over a field of characteristics zero is a matrix Lie algebra. A similar statement fails for Lie groups. Ado's theorem has been used as a major step in the traditional proofs of the Cartan-Lie theorem on the existence of integration of Lie algebras to Lie groups.
