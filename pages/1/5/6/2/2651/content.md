## Idea ##

Given a finite [[n-poset]] $C$, its _Hasse n-graph_ encodes the minimal amount of information necessary to reproduce the ordering relation.

## Definition ##

Given an [[n-poset]] $C$, a **Hasse $n$-graph** $H$ is a [[directed n-graph]] whose $n$-[[n-quiver|quiver]] $F(H)$ is [[equivalence|equivalent]] to $C$.

As with [[Hasse diagram]], I *think* that declaring it to be smallest in unnecessary; the fact that it is merely an $n$-graph and not a $n$-category will do this.  But this should be an $n$-quiver, yes?  ---Toby
