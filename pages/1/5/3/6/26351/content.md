## Idea

A **cylinder factorisation system** on a category is a generalisation of a [[factorisation system]] in which we have a pair $(E, M)$, where $E$ is a class of small cocones, and $M$ is a class of small cones, such that every cylinder factorises uniquely as a cocone in $E$ followed by a cone in $M$.

Cylinder factorisation systems are algebras for a pseudomonad structure given by sending each category to its [[Isbell envelope]]: see [Garner 2015](#Garner).
