## Introduction 

Over the years (as on the FOM mailing list roughly a dozen years ago, as of revision number 4 of this article), various people have "challenged" [[category theory|category theorists]] to write down a fully formal presentation of [[ETCS]]. We will do so here. 

There will be no pretense to elegance or other aesthetic criteria such as efficiency or lack of redundancy. At a first pass we will do things in a quick and dirty way; with luck there will be various polishings of this entry as time passes. 

We assume familiarity with the standard notion of a [[algebraic theory|(finitary) first-order theory]] with equality; this includes the standard rules of deduction in the Gentzen [[sequent calculus]] for first-order logic. 

First-order [[theory|theories]] are typically presented in terms of a [[signature]] consisting of function and predicate symbols, together with axioms each of which is a closed formula in the first-order language generated by the signature. That mode of presentation will be followed here. Standard logical conventions are followed; for example, it is common to state axioms as formulas $P(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$ in which some of the variables $x_i$ may appear freely, with the implicit understanding that such variables are bound by unwritten [[universal quantifiers]] at the heads of formulas, to make the formulas closed. 

To make the exposition more readable, the theory will be built up in stages, together with some explanations (in parentheses) which do not belong to the formal theory, but which may aid comprehension. We also employ the standard device of abbreviating formulas, by declaring at various junctures definitions and notational conventions. 


## The theory of categories 

The signature of $Th(Cat)$ consists of 

* Unary function symbols $s$, $t$; 

* A ternary predicate $c$. 

(The theory of [[categories]] is commonly presented as a two-sorted theory, with an object sort and a morphism sort. Here we instead use [[single-sorted definition of a category|the single-sorted theory]], whose terms are intended to be interpreted as _morphisms_ of a category. We generally use letters $f, g, h, \ldots$ for variable terms. If $e$ is any term, then the intended interpretation of $s(e)$ is: the identity morphism of the domain of $e$. Similarly, $t(e)$ means the identity morphism of the codomain of $e$. The intended interpretation of $c(f, g, h)$ is that $h = f \circ g$.) 

The axioms of $Th(Cat)$ are as follows:  

1. $\vdash (s s(f) = s(f) = t s (f)) \wedge (t t(f) = t(f) = s t(f))$. 

1. $c(f, g, h) \vdash (s(f) = t(g) \wedge t(f) = t(h) \wedge s(g) = s(h))$

1. $s(f) = t(g) \vdash \exists_h c(f, g, h)$

1. (Composition is well-defined) $(c(f, g, h) \wedge c(f, g, h')) \vdash h = h'$

1. (Identity laws) $\vdash c(f, s(f), f) \wedge c(t(f), f, f)$

1. (Associativity) $(c(f, g, j) \wedge c(g, h, k)) \vdash (c(j, h, m) \Leftrightarrow c(f, k, m))$

(Notice that an **object-term** may be defined as a term $e$ for which either of the following equivalent equations holds: $e = s(e)$, $e = t(e)$.)

## The theory of finitely complete categories

The signature of $Th(Lex)$ is obtained by adjoining to the signature of $Th(Cat)$ the following:  

* A nullary function symbol (i.e., a constant) $1$, 

* A quaternary predicate $p$. 

(The intended interpretation is that $1$ is a terminal object, and that $p(f, g, h, k)$ means $f \circ h = g \circ k$, forming a pullback square.) 

The axioms of $Th(Lex)$ are the axioms of $Th(Cat)$ plus the following: 

1. $\vdash 1 = s(1)$

1. (Existence of map to terminal) $f = s(f) \vdash \exists_g (s(g) = f \wedge t(g) = 1)$

1. (Uniqueness of map to terminal) $(s(g) = s(h) \wedge t(g) = 1 = t(h)) \vdash g = h$

1. $p(f, g, h, k) \vdash (s(f) = t(h) \wedge s(g) = t(k) \wedge t(f) = t(g) \wedge s(h) = s(k))$ 

1. (Square commutes) $p(f, g, h, k) \vdash f \circ h = g \circ k$)

1. (Pullback: existence clause) 
$$(p(f, g, h, k) \wedge f \circ h' = g \circ k') \vdash \exists_i (s(i) = s(h') \wedge t(i) = s(h) \wedge h \circ i = h' \wedge k \circ i = k')$$ 

1. (Pullback: uniqueness clause) 
$$(p(f, g, h, k) \wedge s(i) = s(i') \wedge t(i) = s(h) = t(i') \wedge h \circ i = h \circ i' \wedge k \circ i = k \circ i') \vdash i = i'$$


## The theory of elementary toposes 

We introduce a binary predicate expression $M(f, g)$ to abbreviate the following formula in $Th(Cat)$:

$$s(f) = s(g) \wedge (\forall_{h, i} (t(h) = s(g) = t(i) \wedge s(h) = s(i) \wedge f \circ h = f \circ i \wedge g \circ h = g \circ i) \Rightarrow h = i)$$

($M(f, g)$ means that the pair $(f, g)$ is a jointly monic span, aka a relation.) 

The signature of $Th(Topos)$ is obtained by adding to the signature of $Th(Lex)$ the following: 

* Unary function symbols $P, l, r$, 

* A ternary predicate $\Lambda$

(The intended interpretation is that $P(f: X \to Y)$ is the power object of $Y$, and $\langle l(Y), r(Y) \rangle: E(Y) \hookrightarrow P(Y) \times Y$ is the elementhood relation, which we rewrite as a jointly monic span, and consider as a universal relation from $P(Y)$ to $Y$. The notation $\Lambda(f, g, h)$ means that $(f, g)$ is a relation from $X$ to $Y$, and $h: X \to P(Y)$ is the unique map which classifies that relation by pulling back the universal relation that spans between $P(Y)$ and $Y$.) 

The axioms of $Th(Topos)$ are obtained by adjoining to $Th(Lex)$ the following further axioms: 

1. $\vdash P(f) = P(t(f)) = t(P(f)) = t(l(f)) \wedge t(r(f)) = t(f) \wedge s(l(f)) = s(r(f))$ 

1. $\vdash M(l(f), r(f))$

1. $\Lambda(f, g, h) \vdash (M(f, g) \wedge s(h) = t(f) \wedge t(h) = P(g))$ 

1. (Classifying map for relations: existence) 
$$M(f, g) \vdash \exists_h \Lambda(f, g, h)$$ 

1. (Classifying map for relations: uniqueness) 
$$(\Lambda(f, g, h) \wedge \Lambda(f, g, h')) \vdash h = h'$$

1. (Relations obtained by pulling back along classifying map) 
$$\vdash \Lambda(f, g, h) \Leftrightarrow \exists_j (p(l, h, j, f) \wedge g = r  \circ j)$$


## The theory ETCS 

Finally, the signature of $Th(ETCS)$ is obtained by adjoining to the signature of $Th(Topos)$ the following 

* Nullary function symbols (i.e., constants) $\mathbb{N}, 0, \sigma$. 

The axioms of $Th(ETCS)$ are obtained by adjoining to the axioms of $Th(Topos)$ the following further axioms: 

1. (Well-pointedness: equality of maps $x \to y$ is detected by points $1 \to x$) 
$$(s(f) = s(g) \wedge t(f) = t(g)) \vdash \forall_h (s(h) = 1 \wedge t(h) = s(f) \wedge f \circ h = g \circ h) \Rightarrow f = g$$ 

1. (Axiom of Choice: every epi $f$ admits a section $i$) 
$$(\forall_{g, h} (t(f) = s(g) = s(h) \;\wedge\; t(g) = t(h) \;\wedge\; g \circ f = h \circ f) \;\Rightarrow\; g = h) \vdash \exists_i (s(i) = t(f) \;\wedge\; t(i) = s(f) \;\wedge\; f \circ i = t(f))$$

1. (Zero and successor)
$$\vdash s(0) = 1 \wedge t(0) = \mathbb{N} = s(\sigma) = t(\sigma)$$

1. (Recursion: existence) 
$$s(f) = 1 \wedge t(f) = s(g) = t(g) \vdash \exists_h (s(h) = \mathbb{N} \wedge t(h) = t(f) \wedge f = h \circ 0 \wedge h \circ \sigma = g \circ h)$$ 

1. (Recursion: uniqueness) 
$$(s(f) = \mathbb{N} = s(g) \wedge t(f) = t(g) \wedge f \circ 0 = g \circ 0 \wedge f \circ \sigma = g \circ \sigma) \vdash f = g$$

This completes the formal specification of $Th(ETCS)$. 


## Remarks 

Despite the length of the list of axioms, it should be noted that they generally have an extremely simple logical structure. Indeed, with some slight modification, the theory $Th(Topos)$ may be rewritten so that it becomes an [[essentially algebraic theory]], at least in the sense that the models of $Th(Topos)$ are categorially equivalent (as categories = models of $Th(Cat)$) to models of an essentially algebraic theory. That is to say, the notion of "topos" can be internalized in any category with finite limits; this is even true of toposes with natural numbers object. 

Hence, the only "irremovable" existential clauses (that necessitate passing from essentially algebraic logic to a larger fragment of first-order logic) are well-pointedness and the axiom of choice. The axiom of choice belongs to [[geometric logic]]. 

This is in marked contrast to ZFC, whose axiom list is superficially shorter (ignoring the fact that axiom schemas are technically infinite lists of axioms!) but whose logical complexity is much greater. 

It must be added that this fully formal presentation masks much of the conceptual clarity afforded by the underlying categorical and structural insights that are actually at work, particularly the systematic use of universal mapping properties. To put it more sharply: the traditional syntactic machinery used to present first-order theories is not really a natural or well-adapted 'home' for presenting categorical theories such as ETCS. The natural mode of presentation would use diagrams of arrows from the outset, as formalized say by Freyd's Q-sequences, and that is as fully formal as the more traditional (fuddy-duddy) mode adopted here, which after all goes back to Frege and hasn't changed in a century.
