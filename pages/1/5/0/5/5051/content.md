## Life

John Roberts was born in England, his father came from the Ll&#375;n Peninsula. He has worked in Rome at Tor Vergata for a long time.

## Academic life

John Robers wrote his PhD thesis was on [[rigged Hilbert spaces]], a way of making [[Dirac]]'s description of quantum mechanics precise. After that he followed the [[Haag-Kastler axioms|Haag-Kastler approach]] for axiomatizing quantum theory and became one of its central proponents.

Early on he suggested in

that [[local net]]s of [[observable]]s should  carry a notion of [[cohomology]] -- or rather of [[nonabelian cohomology]] -- with coefficients in an [[∞-category]]. Motivated by this he was one of the first to consider [[strict ∞-categories]]. He conjectured that these are characterized by their [[∞-nerve]]s being [[complicial sets]]. This led [[Ross Street]] to develop the notion of [[oriental]]s and eventually to prove this conjecture. An account of this development is on pages 9-10 of

Later Roberts proved together with [[Doplicher]] what is now one of the central results in [[AQFT]], the [[Doplicher-Roberts reconstruction theorem]] -- a version of [[Tannaka duality]] -- which in the context of [[AQFT]] serves to intrinsically characterize the [[superselection sector]]s of a QFT.
