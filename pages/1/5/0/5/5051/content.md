## Life

John Roberts was born in England, but his father came from the Ll&#375;n Peninsula. He worked in Rome at Tor Vergata for a long time, before living his last few years in Goettingen.

## Academic life

John Roberts wrote his PhD thesis was on [[rigged Hilbert spaces]], a way of making [[Dirac]]'s description of quantum mechanics precise. After that he followed the [[Haag-Kastler axioms|Haag-Kastler approach]] for axiomatizing quantum theory and became one of its central proponents.

Early on he suggested in

that [[local net]]s of [[observable]]s should  carry a notion of [[cohomology]] -- or rather of [[nonabelian cohomology]] -- with coefficients in an [[∞-category]]. Motivated by this he was one of the first to consider [[strict ∞-categories]]. He conjectured that these are characterized by their [[∞-nerve]]s being [[complicial sets]]. This led [[Ross Street]] to develop the notion of [[oriental]]s and formulate a precise version of this conjecture, which was proven by [[Dominic Verity]]. An account of this development is on pages 9-10 of

* [[Ross Street]], _An Australian conspectus of higher category theory_ ([pdf](http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/IMA/Street.pdf))

Later Roberts proved together with [[Doplicher]] what is now one of the central results in [[AQFT]], the [[Doplicher-Roberts reconstruction theorem]] -- a version of [[Tannaka duality]] -- which in the context of [[AQFT]] serves to intrinsically characterize the [[superselection sector]]s of a QFT. See also [[DHR superselection theory]].
