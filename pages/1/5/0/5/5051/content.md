John Elias Roberts was a [[mathematical physicist]] working on the mathematical foundations of [[quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum field theory]] in terms of [[AQFT]].

He was born in England, but his father came from the Ll&#375;n Peninsula. He worked in Rome at Tor Vergata for a long time, before living his last few years in Goettingen.

## Selected writings

John Roberts wrote his PhD thesis on the notion of *[[rigged Hilbert spaces]]*, a way of making [[Dirac]]'s description of [[quantum mechanics]] precise. After that he followed the [[Haag-Kastler axioms|Haag-Kastler approach]] for axiomatizing quantum theory and became one of its central proponents.

Early on he suggested in

Roberts]], *Mathematical Aspects of Local Cohomology*, in: *Algèbres d’opérateurs et leurs applications en physique mathématique*, Colloques Internationaux du Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (C.N.R.S) **274**, Paris (1979) 321–332 &lbrack;ISBN:2-222-02441-2, [pdf](https://dmitripavlov.org/scans/roberts-mathematical-aspects-of-local-cohomology.pdf), [[Roberts-LocalCohomology.pdf:file]]&rbrack;

that [[local nets]] of [[quantum observables]] (as formulated in [[algebraic quantum field theory]]) should  carry a notion of [[cohomology]] -- or rather of [[nonabelian cohomology]] -- with [[coefficients]] in an [[∞-category]]. 

Motivated by this he was one of the first to consider a notion of [[strict ∞-categories]]. He [[conjecture|conjectured]] that these are characterized by their [[∞-nerves]] being [[complicial sets]]. This led [[Ross Street]] to develop the notion of [[orientals]] and to formulate a precise version of this conjecture, which was proven by [[Dominic Verity]]. An account of this development is in:

Later Roberts proved together with [[Doplicher]] what is now one of the central results in [[AQFT]], the [[Doplicher-Roberts reconstruction theorem]] -- a version of [[Tannaka duality]] -- which in the context of [[AQFT]] serves to intrinsically characterize the [[superselection sector]]s of a QFT:
