## Idea 

A *discrete valuation ring* is a [[principal ideal domain]] which has exactly one non-[[zero object|zero]] [[maximal ideal]]. This means that it is a [[local ring|local]] [[principal ideal domain]], or equivalently, a [[local integral domain]] with a [[Dedekind-Hasse norm]]. 

##Â Properties

Every [[discrete valuation ring]] is a [[local integral domain]]. 

The ring of [[formal power series]] of a [[field]] is a discrete valuation ring.
