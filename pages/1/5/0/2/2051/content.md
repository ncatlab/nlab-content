[[!redirects Hopf group]]
A discrete group $G$ is a __Hopfian group__ if every surjective [[endomorphism]] $\phi : G\to G$ is an isomorphism. Dually, a discrete group is called __coHopfian__ if any 1-1 endomorphism of $G$ is an isomorphism. 

Clearly all finite groups are Hopfian an coHopfian.
Using Nielsen's method, one can show that every finitely generated free group and the union of any ascending chain of free groups of finite rank are Hopfian. It is known that every torsion-free hyperbolic group is Hopfian.
