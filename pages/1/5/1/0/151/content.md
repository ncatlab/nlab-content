From a fundamental category theoretic perspective, there are two fundamental kinds of dualities:

* _abstract duality_: formally nothing but the reversal of arrows in a ctegory $C$, i.e. the passage from $C$ to the [[opposite category]] $C^{op}$;

* _concrete duality_: the oppositely-oriented image of some diagram under a contravariant [[internal hom]] functor $hom(-,V)$.

(Somebody please provide the canonical reference (Lawvere)...)
