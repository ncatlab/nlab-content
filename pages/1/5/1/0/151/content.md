From a fundamental category theoretic perspective, there are two fundamental kinds of dualities:

* _abstract duality_: formally nothing but the reversal of arrows in a category $C$, i.e. the passage from $C$ to the [[opposite category]] $C^{op}$;

* _concrete duality_: the oppositely-oriented image of some diagram under a contravariant [[internal hom]] functor $hom(-,V)$.

(See Chapter 7 of Lawvere and Rosebrugh's [Sets for Mathematics](http://www.mta.ca/~rrosebru/setsformath/).)

> Not every statement will be taken into its formal dual by the process of dualizing with respect to $V$, and indeed a large part of the study of mathematics

>>space vs. quantity

> and of logic

>>theory vs. example

>may be considered as the detailed study of the extent to which formal duality and concrete duality into a favorite $V$ correspond or fail to correspond. (p. 122)
