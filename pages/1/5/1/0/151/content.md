From a fundamental category theoretic perspective, there are two fundamental kinds of dualities:

* _abstract duality_: formally nothing but the reversal of arrows in a category $C$, i.e. the passage from $C$ to the [[opposite category]] $C^{op}$;

* _concrete duality_: the oppositely-oriented image of some diagram under a contravariant [[internal hom]] functor $hom(-,V)$.

(See Chapter 7 of Lawvere and Rosebrugh's [Sets for Mathematics](http://www.mta.ca/~rrosebru/setsformath/).)

* the duality between [[space and quantity]]
* [[Pontryagin duality]]
* [[Stone duality]]
* [[Eckmann-Hilton duality]]

#Definition#

A _duality_ or _dual equivalence_ is an [[equivalence of categories|equivalence]] between a category $C$ and the abstract dual (i.e. [[opposite category|opposite]]) of a category $D$.

#Remarks#

* Often two categories are not related by a dual equivalence, but just by a [[dual adjunction]]: an [[adjoint functor|adjunction]] between $C^{op}$ and $C$. But every dual adjunction induces a _maximal dual equivalence_ between subcategories of $C$ and $D$, as described below.

#Dualizing objects#

Of particular interest are concrete dualities between concrete categories $C, D$, i.e. categories equipped with a faithful functor 
$f : C \to Set$, $\hat f : D \to Set$
to [[Set]], which are represented by objects $a \in C$, $\hat a \in D$ with the same underlying set $f(a) = \hat f(\hat a)$. Such objects are known as [[dualizing object]]s.
