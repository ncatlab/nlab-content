A [[cofibration]] is a member of a distinguished class of cofibrations in one of the several homotopy related setups:

* [[model category|Quillen categories]] of models for homotopy theory

* categories with cofibrations of Baues

* Waldhausen categories

In traditional [[topology]] by a cofibration one usually means [[Hurewicz cofibration]]. 

In [[category theory]] and [[descent theory]], Grothendieck however introduced a notion of cofibered category or cofibration, whose definition is categorically dual to the [[fibered category]] and based on the generalization of the universal property of coCartesian squares, however it is not corresponding to the extension property in topology, but to a lifting property, like for [[fibration]]s. For that reason, Gray suggested and this is to some extent adopted in $n$lab to call such categories [[opfibration]]s. In quasicategorical setup, the generalizations of fibered categories are called [[Cartesian fibration]]s, and the generalizations of op/co-fibered categories are called coCartesian fibrations. 
In 1-categorical setup coCartesians arrow in op/co-fibrations are indeed the ones which complete coCartesian squares in the special and most important case of [[domain opfibration]].
