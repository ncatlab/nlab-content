[[!redirects Hausdorff maximality principle]]


The __Hausdorff maximal principle__ is a version of [[Zorn's lemma]], equivalent to the usual version and thus (given [[excluded middle]]) equivalent to the [[axiom of choice]].

## Statement and proofs

Given a [[partial order|poset]] $S$, let a _chain_ in $S$ be a [[subset]] $A$ of $S$ which, as a sub-poset, is [[total order|totally ordered]].  A chain $A$ is _maximal_ (as a chain) if the only chain that $A$ is contained in is $A$ itself.
