This page is for announcing events (conferences, workshops, ...) that could be of some interest for the working category theorist.

To add an announcement, hit "edit" at the bottom of this page: In the edit pane that opens, add a bullet item to the [following list](#LatestsEvents) (use inverse chronological order), *and* copy the same item into the comment-box below the edit pane, as that will make the announcement be posted more visibly to the [nForum](https://nforum.ncatlab.org/) (see [this thread](https://nforum.ncatlab.org/discussion/17291/category-theory-events/#Item_1)).
