* [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], 

  _Logisch-Philosophische Abhandlung_ (1921), published in English as

  _Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus_ (1922)

  ([Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tractatus_Logico-Philosophicus)).

The text deals with [[ontology]] and [[formal logic]] but, arguably, also is concerned with ethics as pointed out by ([Cora Diamond](#Diamond00)) and [Wittgenstein himself](#Wittgenstein19):

> der Sinn des Buches ist ein Ethischer. Ich wollte einmal in das Vorwort einen Satz geben, der nun tats&#228;chlich nicht darin steht, den ich Ihnen aber jetzt schreibe, weil er Ihnen vielleicht ein Schl&#252;ssel sein wird: Ich wollte n&#228;mlich schreiben, mein Werk bestehe aus zwei Teilen:
aus dem, der hier vorliegt, und aus alledem, was ich _nicht_ geschrieben habe. Und gerade dieser zweite Teil ist der Wichtige. Es wird n&#228;mlich das Ethische durch mein Buch gleichsam von Innen her begrenzt; und ich bin &#252;berzeugt, dass es, _streng, nur so_ zu begrenzen ist.

> the book's point is ethical. I once meant to include in the preface a sentence which is not in fact there now, but which I will write out for you here, because it will perhaps be a key for you. What I meant to write then was this: my work consists of two parts: the one presented here plus all that I have _not_ written. And it is precisely this second part that is the important one. For the ethical gets its limit draw from the inside, as it were, by my book; and I am convinced that this is the _only rigorous_ way of drawing that limit.

This quote gives a taste of the problems encountered by any attempt to give an in-depth interpretation of Wittgenstein and the Tractatus in particular.
It therefore may not seem surprising that the Tractatus has been related to [[mysticism]], see ([McGuinnes66](#McGuinnes66)).

## Contents

The book states seven "propositions" (with sub-propositions):

1. The world is everything that is the case.

1. What is the case (a fact) is the existence of states of affairs.

1. A logical picture of facts is a thought.

1. A thought is a proposition with a sense.

   {#4.11} 4.11 The totality of true propositions is the whole of natural science (or the whole corpus of the natural sciences).

1. A proposition is a truth-function of elementary propositions. (An elementary proposition is a truth-function of itself.)

1. The general form of a proposition is the general form of a truth function, ...

1. Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.

## Formal Logic

Wittgenstein suggest a new formal language that he puts in contrast to Russell's type theoretic system elaborated in the famous [[Principia Mathematica]], which he criticizes.
Russell in turn took Wittgenstein's suggestions serious giving an interpretation of them, first, in his introduction to the English translation of the Tractatus, which in the Anglo-Saxon reception has become almost a part of early Wittgenstein's magnum opus itself, and, second, in an appendix to a later edition of the Principia Mathematica.

The meaning of Wittgenstein's formal system remains disputed to this day, e.g. ([Wehmeier11](#Wehmeier11)).
