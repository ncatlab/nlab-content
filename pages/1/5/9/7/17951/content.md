## Idea

In analogy to how there is conjectured to be a [[non-perturbative effect|non-perturbative]] completion of [[superstring theory]] on 10-dimensional [[spacetimes]] to an 11-dimensional theory to be called "[[M-theory]]", there has been the speculation that the [[bosonic string]] with its 26-dimensional [[target spacetime]] might have a non-perturbative completion in a 27-dimensional theory of sorts: "bosonic M-theory" ([Horowitz-Susskind 00](#HorowitzSusskind00))

The term "bosonic M-theory" was coined in

The suggestion that the 26 dimensions of the [[target spacetime]] of the [[bosonic string]] could somehow be identified with the $10_{even} + 16_{odd}$ dimensions of the [[heterotic string]] was previously voiced in
