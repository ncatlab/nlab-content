## Definition

$\Fin\Set$ is the [[category]] of [[finite set]]s and all [[function]]s between them: the [[full subcategory]] of [[Set]] on finite sets.  

(For [[constructive mathematics|constructive]] purposes, take the strictest sense of 'finite'.)

It is easy (and thus common) to make $\Fin\Set$ [[skeleton|skeletal]]; there is one [[object]] for each [[natural number]] $n$ (including $n = 0$), and a [[morphism]] from $m$ to $n$ is an $m$-tuple $(f_0, \ldots, f_{m-1})$ of numbers satisfying $0 \leq f_i \lt n$.  This amounts to identifying $n$ with the set $\{0, \ldots, n - 1\}$.  (Sometimes $\{1, \ldots, n\}$ is used instead.)


## Properties

### Opposite category

###### Proposition

The [[opposite category]] of $FinSet$ is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to that of finite [[Boolean algebras]]

$$
  FinSet^{op} \simeq FinBool
  \,.
$$

This equivalence is induced by the [[power set]]-[[functor]]

$$
  \mathcal{P} \;\colon\; FinSet^{op} \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} FinBool
  \,.
$$

This is discussed for instance as ([Awodey, prop. 7.31](#Awodey)). For the generalization to all sets see at _[Set -- Properties -- Opposite category and Boolean algebras](Set#OppositeCategory)_. See at _[[Stone duality]]_ for more on this.

###### Remark

In constructive mathematics, for any flavor of _[[finite set|finite]]_, $\mathcal{P}$ defines an equivalence of $FinSet$ with the opposite category of that of those [[complete lattice|complete]] [[atom|atomic]] [[Heyting algebras]] whose set of atomic elements is finite (in the same sense as in the definition of $FinSet$). However, all finite [[complete lattice|complete]] [[atom|atomic]] [[Heyting algebras]] are Boolean.

### Universal properties

$FinSet$ is the free category with finite coproducts on one object: that is, for any category $C$ with finite coproducts and any object $c \in C$ there is a functor $F : FinSet \to C$ preserving finite coproducts with $F(1) = c$, and $F$ is unique up to natural isomorphism.   

The first fact is closely connected to the fact that $FinSet$ is the [[vertical categorification]] of the set of natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$, and $\mathbb{N}$ is the [[free monoid]] on one generator. 

$FinSet$ is also the free category with finite colimits on one object: that is, for any category $C$ with finite colimits and any object $c \in C$ there is a functor $F : FinSet \to C$ preserving finite colimits with $F(1) = c$, and $F$ is unique up to natural isomorphism. 

$FinSet$ is also the free symmetric monoidal category on a commutative monoid object: that is, for any symmetric monoidal category $(C, \otimes)$ and any commutative monoid object $c \in C$ there is a symmetric monoidal functor $F : (FinSet,+) \to (C, \otimes)$ with $F(1) = c$, and $F$ is unique up to monoidal natural isomorphism.   

The last fact is closely connected to this: $FinSet$, made symmetric monoidal using $+$, is equivalent to the [[PROP]] for commutative monoids. A proof is given in Lafont's paper below.  Moreover, the sub-prop generated by the unit of the monoid consists of the monics, while the free prop generated by the multiplication of the monoid are the epics.

All these universal properties have useful duals.  $FinSet^{op}$ is the free category with finite products on one object and also the free category with finite limits on one object; the symmetric monoidal category $(FinSet, +)^{op}$ is equivalent to the PROP for cococommutative comonoids.

### Equivalence with the category of finite $T_1$-topological spaces

Given a [[continuous map]] $f \colon X \to Y$ between [[topological spaces]], it is order-preserving relative to the [[specialisation order]]. Thus, we have a [[faithful functor]] $Spec$ from the category of [[Top|$\mathrm{Top}$]] of topological spaces to the category $\mathrm{PreOrd}$ of [[preordered sets]].

In the other direction, to each [[preordered set]] $(X, \leq)$ we may associate a topological space whose [[elements]] are those of $X$, and whose [[open subsets]] are precisely the upward-closed sets with respect to the preordered set. This topology is called the [[specialization topology]]. This defines a [[functor]] 

$$i \colon  PreOrd \to Top$$ 

which is a [[full subcategory|full embedding]]; the [[essential image]] of this functor is the category of [[Alexandroff spaces]] (spaces in which an arbitrary [[intersection]] of open sets is open). Hence the category of preorders is equivalent to the category of Alexandroff spaces. 

There is an an [[adjoint functor|adjunction]] $i \dashv Spec$ between the categories [[PreOrd]] and [[Top]] making $PreOrd$ a [[coreflective subcategory]] of $Top$. In particular, the [[adjunction counit]] evaluated at a space $X$, 

$$i(Spec(X)) \to X,$$ 

is the [[identity function]] at the level of sets, and is [[continuous function|continuous]] because any open $U$ of $X$ is upward-closed with respect to $\leq$, according to the second equivalent condition of the definition of the specialization order. 

This [[adjunction]] restricts to an [[adjoint equivalence]] between the categories $\mathrm{FinPreOrd}$ and $\mathrm{FinTop}$ of finite preordered sets and finite topological spaces. The [[adjunction unit|unit]] and [[adjunction counit|counit]] are both [[identity functions]] on [[underlying sets]], so that in fact we have an equivalence between these categories as [[concrete categories]]. 

Since the [[specialization order]] of [[T_1-topological space|$T_1$-topological spaces]] is [[equality]] in $T_1$-spaces, and every subset is upward-closed with respect to the [[equality]] relation used to define the [[specialization topology]] of a [[set]], the above adjunction further restricts to an [[adjoint equivalence]] between the categories $\mathrm{FinSet}$ of [[finite sets]] and $\mathrm{Fin}T_1\mathrm{Sp}$ of finite $T_1$-topological spaces. 

### In Grpd

$FinSet$ is a [[natural numbers object]] in the [[(2,1)-topos]] [[Grpd]] of [[groupoids]] and [[functors]], as it is an initial algebra of the 2-endofunctor $F(X) \cong 1 + X$. It is also a [[free object|free]] [[monoid object]] on one generator in [[Grpd]], an [[initial object|initial]] [[rig object]] in [[Grpd]], and a [[category]]. This all follows from the fact that the category $FinSet$ is a [[vertical categorification]] of the [[poset]] $\mathbb{N}$ of natural numbers.

As a groupoid itself, the [[core]] of $Fin Set$ is (with the operation of [[disjoint union]]) the free [[symmetric monoidal category]] on one object.  (There is no way to generate non-invertible morphisms from this data.)


### In topos theory

The category $FinSet$ is an [[elementary topos]] and the inclusion $FinSet \hookrightarrow Set$ is a [[logical morphism]] of toposes. ([[Elephant|Elephant, example 2.1.2]]).

Mathematics done within or about $FinSet$ is [[finite mathematics]].

A [[presheaf]] of sets on $\Fin\Set$ is a [[symmetric set]]; one generally uses the skeletal version of $\Fin\Set$ for this.

The [[copresheaf]] category $[FinSet,Set]$ is the [[classifying topos]] for the _[[theory of objects]]_ (the empty theory over the signature with one sort and no primitive symbols except equality). ([[Elephant|Elephant, D3.2]]).


### Subcategories of $FinSet$

The [[simplex category]] $\Delta$ embeds into $\Fin\Set$ as a category with the same objects but fewer morphisms. The category of [[cyclic set]]s introduced by Connes lies in between. All the three are special cases of extensions of $\Delta$ by a group in a particularly nice way. Full classification of allowed [[skew-simplicial sets]] has been given by Krasauskas and independently by Loday and Fiedorowicz.


### As a Lawvere theory

The [[cartesian monoidal category]] $FinSet_+$ of nonempty finite sets is the multi-sorted [[Lawvere theory]] of unbiased [[boolean algebra]]s. As a [[Lawvere theory]], $FinSet$ has one more sort, corresponding to $\emptyset$, and one more model, in which every sort has exactly one element (in all the other models, the sort corresponding to $\emptyset$ is empty).
