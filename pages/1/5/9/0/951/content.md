$\Fin\Set$ is the [[category]] of [[finite set]]s and all [[function]]s between them.  (For [[constructive mathematics|constructive]] purposes, take the strictest sense of 'finite'.)

It is easy (and thus common) to make $\Fin\Set$ [[skeleton|skeletal]]; there is one [[object]] for each [[natural number]] $n$ (including $n = 0$), and a [[morphism]] from $m$ to $n$ is an $m$-tuple $(f_0, \ldots, f_{m-1})$ of numbers satisfying $0 \leq f_i \lt n$.  This amounts to identifying $n$ with the set $\{0, \ldots, n - 1\}$.  (Sometimes $\{1, \ldots, n\}$ is used instead.)

Mathematics done within or about $\Fin\Set$ is [[finite mathematics]].

A [[presheaf]] of sets on $\Fin\Set$ is a [[symmetric set]]; one generally uses the skeletal version of $\Fin\Set$ for this.

The [[simplex category]] $\Delta$ embeds into $\Fin\Set$ as a category with the same objects but fewer morphisms. The category of [[cyclic set]]s introduced by Connes lies in between. All the three are special cases of extensions of $\Delta$ by a group in a particularly nice way. Full classification of allowed "skewsimplical groups" has been given by Krasauskas and independently by Loday and Fiedorowicz.
