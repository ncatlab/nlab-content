## Idea

A [[setoid]] or [[Bishop set]] whose [[quotient set]] is a [[group]]. Equivalently, a [[locally thin 2-category|locally thin]] [[2-group]], or in foundations where [[2-categories]] are [[locally univalent bicategory|locally univalent]] by default, a [[locally thin 2-category|locally thin]] [[pregroupoid|pre]]-2-group. Also, equivalently, a [[monoidal setoid]] in which the monoidal product with any element has an [[inverse]] up to [[equivalence relation]]. 

“Groupal setoid”, "groupal Bishop set", and "Bishop group" are placeholder names for a concept which may or may not have another name in the mathematics literature. 

## Definition

Here we assume that setoids or Bishop sets are equipped with an [[equivalence relation]] (rather than a [[pseudo-equivalence relation]]). A **groupal setoid**, **groupal Bishop set**, or **Bishop group** is a [[monoidal setoid]] $(A, \sim, e, m)$ with a function $i:A \to A$ such that 

* $i$ preserves the [[equivalence relation]]: for all elements $a \in A$ and $b \in A$, if $a \sim b$, then $i(a) \sim i(b)$. 

* $i$ satisfies the left and right inverse laws up to the equivalence relation: for all elements $a \in A$, $m(a, i(a)) \sim e$ and $m(i(a), a) \sim e$. 

$A$ is **[[abelian group|abelian groupal]]** or **[[symmetric 2-group|symmetric groupal]]** or **[[braided 2-group|braided groupal]]** if additionally for all elements $a \in A$ and $b \in A$, $m(a, b) \sim m(b, a)$. 

## Examples

* The set $\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{2}$ of functions from the [[boolean domain]] $\mathbb{2}$ to the [[natural numbers]] $\mathbb{N}$, equipped with the equivalence relation $f \sim g \coloneqq f(0) + g(1) = f(1) + g(0)$, is an abelian groupal setoid.  

* Given any [[Archimedean ordered field]] $F$, the set of [[Cauchy sequences]] in $F$ is an abelian groupal setoid. 

* Given any [[Archimedean ordered field]] $F$, the set of all [[locators]] of all elements of $F$ is an abelian groupal setoid.

* Given two [[abelian groups]] $G$ and $H$, the [[free abelian group]] $F(G \times H)$ of the product of the carrier sets of $G$ and $H$, equipped with the [[equivalence relation]] $\sim$ generated by 
$$(g_1, h) + (g_2, h) \sim (g_1 + g_2, h)$$
for all $g_1, g_2 \in G$ and $h \in H$ and
$$(g, h_1) + (g, h_2) \sim (g, h_1 + h_2)$$
for all $g \in G$ and $h_1, h_2 \in H$, is an abelian groupal setoid whose [[quotient set]] is the [[tensor product of abelian groups]] $G \otimes H$.
