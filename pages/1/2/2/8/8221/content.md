## Idea

The standard [[model (in theoretical physics)]] for the [[observable universe]] on the largest length scales of [[cosmology]]:

it is an [[cosmic inflation|inflationary]] [[FRW spacetime]] with [[cosmological constant]] ("[[dark energy]]") and cold [[dark matter]]. The technical term for this is the _$\Lambda$ CDM concordance model_ (where "$\Lambda$" is the standard symbol for the [[cosmological constant]] and "CDM" is for "cold dark matter"). 



The current model assumes that the energy density of the [[observable universe]] consists of

* 4.9% [[baryon|baryonic]] (visible) [[matter]]

* 26.8% [[dark matter]]

* 68.3% [[dark energy]].

## Properties

### Structure formation

Computer simulation of [[cosmic structure formation]] on scales larger than that of [[galaxies]] had always shown very good agreement of the $\Lambda CDM$ [[standard model of cosmology]] and observation.

There used to be various discrepancies of [[cold dark matter]]-[[model (in theoretical physics)|models]] on the scale of [[galaxies]]

  * [core-cusp behaviour](dark+matter#CuspCoreProblem).

  * [[galaxy rotation curves]]

  * [[Tully-Fisher relation]]

But recent analysis seems to show that more fine-grained analysis shows that [[cold dark matter]]-[[model (in theoretical physics)|models]] match all of these observations well. See behind the above links for more.



### Vacuum energy and Cosmological constant

The [[renormalization]] freedom in [[perturbative QFT|perturbative]] [[quantization]] of [[gravity]] ([[perturbative quantum gravity]]) induces freedom in the choice of [[vacuum expectation value]] of the [[stress-energy tensor]] and hence in the [[cosmological constant]].
