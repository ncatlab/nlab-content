## Idea

The standard [[model (in theoretical physics)]] for the [[observable universe]] on the largest length scales of [[cosmology]]:

it is an [[cosmic inflation|inflationary]] [[FRW spacetime]] with [[cosmological constant]] ("[[dark energy]]") and cold [[dark matter]]. The technical term for this is the _$\Lambda$ CDM concordance model_ (where "$\Lambda$" is the standard symbol for the [[cosmological constant]] and "CDM" is for "cold dark matter"). 



The current model assumes that the energy density of the [[observable universe]] consists of

* 4.9% [[baryon|baryonic]] (visible) [[matter]]

* 26.8% [[dark matter]]

* 68.3% [[dark energy]].

## Properties

### Structure formation

Computer simulation of [[cosmic structure formation]] on scales larger than that of [[galaxies]] had always shown very good agreement of the $\Lambda CDM$ [[standard model of cosmology]] and observation.

There used to be various discrepancies of [[cold dark matter]]-[[model (in theoretical physics)|models]] on the scale of [[galaxies]]

  * [core-cusp behaviour](dark+matter#CuspCoreProblem).

  * [[galaxy rotation curves]]

  * [[Tully-Fisher relation]]

But recent analysis seems to show that more fine-grained analysis shows that [[cold dark matter]]-[[model (in theoretical physics)|models]] match all of these observations well. See behind the above links for more.



### Vacuum energy and Cosmological constant

The [[renormalization]] freedom in [[perturbative QFT|perturbative]] [[quantization]] of [[gravity]] ([[perturbative quantum gravity]]) induces freedom in the choice of [[vacuum expectation value]] of the [[stress-energy tensor]] and hence in the [[cosmological constant]].

> In March 2013, following an accurate processing of available measurement data, the Planck Scientific Collaboration published the highest-resolution photograph ever of the early Universe when it was only a few hundred thousand years old. The photograph showed galactic seeds in sufficient detail to test some nontrivial theoretical predictions made more than thirty years ago. Most amazing was that all predictions were confirmed to be remarkably accurate. With no exaggeration, we may consider it established experimentally that quantum physics, which is normally assumed to be relevant on the atomic and subatomic scale, also works on the scale of the entire Universe, determining its structure with all its galaxies, stars, and planets.

### Possible tension with observation

Possible tensions in the model, regarding determination of the [[Hubble constant]] in the early and late universe, apparently observed by various groups, since the late 2010s:
