## Idea

In the pattern of [[(n,r)-categories]] the notion of [[(∞,1)-category]] is special in that it is precisely the structure that

* admits [[homotopy theory]] in that it encodes the notion of higher coherent equivalence;

* admits [[category theory]] in terms of [[universal construction]]s: [[limit]]s, [[adjunction]]s, [[Grothendieck construction]]s, etc.

This entry surveys the _category theory of $(\infty,1)$-categories_ .

## Basic notions {#BasicCatNotions}

* [[nLab:homotopy category of an (∞,1)-category]]

* presentation by a [[nLab:category with weak equivalences]]:
  [[nLab:Dwyer-Kan localization]]

* [[nLab:(∞,1)-functor]]

* [[nLab:(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-categories]]

* the archetypical $(\infty,1)$-category: [[nLab:∞Grpd]]

* [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-presheaves]]

* [[nLab:terminal object in a quasi-category]]




## Universal constructions {#UniversalConstructions}

The [[universal construction]]s of [[category theory]] generalize, with unique existence of universal morphisms replaced by the requirement of a _contractible space_ of universal morphisms.

* [[limit in a quasi-category]]

* [[adjoint (∞,1)-functor]]

* [[(∞,1)-Grothendieck construction]]
