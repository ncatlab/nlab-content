The standard simplicial $n$-simplex is the [[simplicial set]] which is represented (as a [[presheaf]]) by the object $[n]$ in the [[simplex category]].

Likewise, there is a standard toplogical $n$-simplex, which is (more or less by definition) the [[geometric realization]] of the standard simplicial $n$-simplex.
