## Idea

A _Chern-Simons form_ $CS(A)$ is a [[differential form]] naturally associated to a differential form $A \in \Omega^1(P,\mathfrak{g})$ with values in a [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$: it is the form trivializing a [[curvature characteristic form]] $\langle F_A \wedge \cdots \wedge F_A \rangle$ of $A$, for $\langle \cdots \rangle$ an [[invariant polynomial]]: 

$$
  d_{dR} CS(A) = \langle F_A \wedge \cdots \wedge F_A \rangle
  \,,
$$

where $F_A \in \Omega^2(X,\mathfrak{g})$ is the [[curvature]] 2-form of $A$.

More generally, for $A,A' \in \Omega^1(P, \mathfrak{g})$ two $\mathfrak{g}$-valued 1-forms and for $\hat A \in \Omega^1(P \times [0,1],\mathfrak{g})$ a "path of connections", the Chern-Simons form relative to $A$ and $A'$ is a form that trivializes the _difference_ between the two curvature characteristic forms

$$
  d_{dR}CS(A,A') = \langle (F_A)^k \rangle - \langle (F_{A'})^k \rangle
  \,.
$$

Chern-Simons forms are of interest notably when the differential forms $A,A'$ are (local representatives of) [[connection on a bundle|connections]] on a $G$-[[principal bundle]] $P \to X$, for instance if $A \in \Omega^1(P,\mathfrak{g})$ is an [[Ehresmann connection]] 1-form.

Often the term _Chern-Simons form_ is taken to refer to the case where $\mathfrak{g}$ is a [[semisimple Lie algebra]] with binary [[invariant polynomial]] $\langle -, -\rangle$ (e.g. the [[Killing form]]) in which case $CS(A)$ is the 3-form

$$
  \langle A \wedge d_{dR} A\rangle
  + 
  c
  \langle
    A \wedge [A \wedge A]
  \rangle
  \,.
$$

 Even more specifically, often the term is understood to refer to the case where $\mathfrak{g} \subset \mathfrak{gl}(n)$ is a [[matrix Lie algebra]], for instance $\mathfrak{o}(n)$ (for the [[orthogonal group]]) or notably $\mathfrak{u}(n)$ (for the [[unitary group]]). In that case the invariant polynomials may be taken to be given by matrix [[trace]]s: $\langle \cdots \rangle = tr(\cdots )$.

## Details {#Details}


It is sufficient to discuss properties of Chern-Simons forms for $\mathfrak{g}$-valued 1-forms. The corresponding statements for connections on a $G$-bundle follow straightforwardly.

### Paths of connections

Let $U$ be a [[smooth manifold]]. 

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Definition

A **smooth path** of $\mathfrak{g}$-valued 1-forms on $U$ is a smooth 1-form $\hat A \in \Omega^1(U\times [0,1],\mathfrak{g})$ 

Call this path **pure shift** if $\iota_{\partial_t} \hat A = 0$, where $t : U \times [0,1] \to [0,1] \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is the canonical coordinate along the interval. 

We say this path goes from $A_0 := \psi_0^* \hat A$ to $A_1 := \psi_1^* \hat A$, where

$$
  \psi_t :  U \simeq U \times * \stackrel{Id \times t}{\to} U \times [0,1]
$$

picks the copy of $U$ at parameter $t$.

=--

So a smooth path is a smooth 1-form on the cylinder $U \times [0,1]$ and it is _pure shift_ if it has no "leg" along the $[0,1]$-direction. We will see that $\iota_{\partial_t} \hat A$ is infinitesimal gauge transformation, while $\partial_t \hat A$ is infinitesimal shift of the connection.


+-- {: .un_def}
###### Definition/Observation

Let $P$ be an [[invariant polynomial]] on $\mathfrak{g}$ of arity $n$.

Consider the [[fiber integration]]

$$
  CS_P(A_0,A_1) :=
  \int_{[0,1]} P(F_{\hat A} \wedge \cdots \wedge F_{\hat A})
  \,.
$$

This defines a $(2n-1)$-form $CS_P(A_0,A_1) \in \Omega^{2n-1}(U)$.

We have that the exterior differential of this form is the difference of the [[curvature characteristic form]]s of $A_0$ and $A_1$:

$$
  d_{dR} CS_P(A_0,A_1)
  =
  P(F_{A_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge F_{A_1})
  -
  P(F_{A_0} \wedge \cdots \wedge F_{A_0})
$$


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Write the fiber integration more explicitly as a [[Riemann integral]]

$$
  CS_P(A_0,A_1) =
  \int_{[0,1]} 
    \psi_t^* \iota_{\partial_t} P(F_{\hat A} \wedge \cdots \wedge F_{\hat A})
    d t
  \,.
$$


Then use that $d_{dR}$ is linear and commutes with pullback, use [[Cartan's magic formula]] $d_{dR} \circ \iota_{\partial_t} + \iota_{\partial} \circ d_{dR} = \mathcal{L}_{\partial_t}$ in view of the fact that $P(F_{\hat A} \wedge \cdots \wedge F_{\hat A})$ is a [[closed form]] and then finally apply the [[Stokes theorem]]:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    d_{dR} \int_0^1 \psi^*_t  \iota_{\partial_t} 
    P(F_{\hat A} \wedge \cdots \wedge F_{\hat A}) d t
   & =
    \int_0^1 d_{dR}  \psi^*_t  \iota_{\partial_t} 
     P(F_{\hat A} \wedge \cdots \wedge F_{\hat A}) d t
    \\
   & =
    \int_0^1 \psi^*_t  d_{dR}   \iota_{\partial_t} 
      P(F_{\hat A} \wedge \cdots \wedge F_{\hat A}) d t
    \\
   & =
    \int_0^1 \psi^*_t  \frac{d}{d t} 
      P(F_{\hat A} \wedge \cdots \wedge F_{\hat A}) d t
    \\
   & =
    \int_0^1 \left(\frac{d}{d t} 
      P(F_{\hat A} \wedge \cdots \wedge F_{\hat A})\right)(t) d t
    \\
   & =
   \psi^*_1 P(F_{\hat A} \wedge \cdots \wedge F_{\hat A})
   -
   \psi^*_0 P(F_{\hat A} \wedge \cdots \wedge F_{\hat A})   
   \\
    &=
   P(F_{A_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge F_{A_1})
   -
   P(F_{A_0} \wedge \cdots \wedge F_{A_0})       
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

=--


### Explicit formulas

Above we saw that a general expression for the Chern-Simons $CS_P(A_0,A_1)$ obtained from a path of connections $\hat A$ between $A_0$ and $A_1$ is

$$
  CS_P(A_0, A_1) = \int_{[0,1]} P(F_{\hat A} \wedge \cdots \wedge F_{\hat A})
  \,.
$$

We now unwind this to get explicit formulas for the Chern-Simons form in terms of wedge products of connection forms and their curvatures.

For  $\hat A$ a pure shift path, $\hat A : t \mapsto A_t$
notice that the [[curvature]] 2-form of $\hat A$ is 

$$
  F_{\hat A}(t) = F_{A_t} + (\partial_t A_t) \wedge d t
  \,.
$$

Inserting this into the above expression yields

$$
  CS_P(A_0,A_1)
  =
  \int_0^1 P(\partial_t A \wedge F_{A_t} \wedge \cdots \wedge F_{A_t})
  \,.
$$

Notably if $A_0 = 0$ and $\hat A$ is the _constant_ path $\hat A : t \mapsto t A$ to $A_1  := A$ such that

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    F_{\hat A} 
    &= t d_{dR} A + t^2 [A \wedge A]
    \\
    &=  
    t F_A + (t^2 - t) [A \wedge A]
  \end{aligned}
$$


this yields

$$
  CS_P(A)
  :=
  \int_0^1 P(A \wedge (t F_{A} + (t^2 - t) [A \wedge A])) 
    \wedge \cdots (t F_{A} + (t^2 - t) [A \wedge A])))
  \,.
$$

This is just an integral over a polynomial in $t$ with constant coefficients in forms. Peforming the integral yields a bunch of coefficients $c_i$ and with these the Chern-Simons form achieves the form

$$
  CS(A)
  = 
  c_1 \langle A \wedge F_A \wedge \cdots \wedge F_A \rangle
  + 
  c_2 \langle A \wedge [A \wedge A] \wedge F_A \wedge \cdots F_A \rangle
  +
  \cdots
  \,.
$$ 

Particularly for $n = 2$ and using the definition of the 
[[curvature]] 2-form $F_A = d_{dR} A + [A \wdge A]$ we get 

$$
  CS(A)
  =
  \langle A \wedge d A\rangle
  + 
  c \langle A \wedge [A \wedge A]\rangle
  \,.
$$


### Gauged paths of connections

Above we defined $CS(A_0,A_1)$ for every path of connections form $A_0$ to $A_1$ which is _pure shift_ . This is a possibly convenient but unnecessary restriction:

Notice that a general (gauged) path is a general 1-form $\hat A \in \Omega^1(U \times [0,1], \mathfrak{g})$ which we can decompose in the form

$$
  \hat A : t \mapsto  A_t + \lambda d t 
  \,,
$$

where $\lambda$ is a $\mathfrak{g}$-valued function. The [[parallel transport]] of $\lambda d t$ along $[0,1]$ defines an element in $G$ and shift $(\partial_t A)_t$ of the connection along $[0,1]$ is now relative to the gauge transformation on $A$ induced by this function: the curvature 2-form now is

$$
  F_{\hat A}
  : t \mapsto
  F_{A_t}
  + 
  ((\partial_t A)_t + d_U \lambda(t) + [\lambda,A]) \wedge d t
$$

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

The Chern-Simons form $\int_{[0,1]} P(F_{\hat A} \wedge \cdots \wedge F_{\hat A})$ defined with respect to any gauged lift of a pure shift path of connections differs from that of the pure shift path by an exact term.

## As secondary characteristic forms

If a [[curvature characteristic form]] _vanishes_ (for instance if the [[connection on a bundle|connection]] is flat or the degree of the curvature characteristic form is simply greater than the dimension of $X$) the corresponding Chern-Simons form is a [[closed form]]. So in this case the [[de Rham cohomology]] class of the curvature characteristic form becomes trivial, but the Chern-Simons form provides another de Rham class. This is therefore called a **secondary characteristic class**.


...


### Chern-Simons theory

In particular on a 3-dimensional [[smooth manifold]] $X$ necessarily the Chern-Simons 3-form is closed. The [[functional]]

$$
  (A \in \Omega^1(X,\mathfrak{g}))
  \mapsto
  \int_X CS(A)
$$

is the [[action functional]] of the [[quantum field theory]] called [[Chern-Simons theory]].

More generally, for $X$ a $(2n-1)$-dimensional [[smooth manifold]] and $\langle -,\cdots, -\rangle$ an invariant polynomial of arity $n$, the analous formula defines the [[action functional]] of  $(2n+1)$-dimensional Chern-Simons theory.


## In terms of $\infty$-Lie algebroids

As discussed at [[invariant polynomial]], Chern-Simons elements int the [[Weil algebra]] $W(\mathfrak{g})$ of a [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ induce the transgression between invariant polynomials and cocycles in [[Lie algebra cohomology]].

For 

$$
  \array{
    T_{vert} P &\stackrel{A_{vert}}{\to}& \mathfrak{g}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    T P &\stackrel{(A,F_A)}{\to}& inn(\mathfrak{g})
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    T X &\stackrel{(P_i(F_A))}{\to}& \prod_i b^{n_i} \mathfrak{u}(1)
  }
$$

the data of an [[Ehresmann connection]] on a $G$-[[principal bundle]] expressed as a diagram of [[âˆž-Lie algebroid]]s with the [[curvature characteristic form]]s on the bottom, a choice of transgression element $cs_P$ for an [[invariant polynomial]] $P$ in transgression with a Lie algebra cocycle $\mu$ induces a diagram

$$
  \array{
    \mathfrak{g} &\stackrel{\mu}{\to}& b^n \mathfrak{u}(1)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    inn(\mathfrak{g}) &\stackrel{(cs_P,P)}{\to}& e b^{n} \mathfrak{u}(1)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \prod_i b^{n_i}\mathfrak{u}(1) &\stackrel{p_i}{\to}& b^{n+1} \mathfrak{u}(1)
  }
  \,.
$$

The [[pasting]] of this to the above [[Ehresmann connection]] expresses in the middle horizontal morphism the Chern-Simons form $cs_P(A)$ and its [[curvature characteristic form]] $P(F_A)$

$$
  \array{
    T_{vert} P &\stackrel{A_{vert}}{\to}& \mathfrak{g} &\stackrel{\mu}{\to}& 
    b^n \mathfrak{u}(1)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    T P &\stackrel{A}{\to}& inn(\mathfrak{g})
    &\stackrel{(cs_P,P)}{\to}&
    e b^n \mathfrak{u}(1)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    T X &\stackrel{(P_i)}{\to}& \prod_i b^{n_i} \mathfrak{u}(1)
    &\stackrel{p_i}{\to}&
    b^{n+1} \mathfrak{u}(1)
  }
  \,.
$$
