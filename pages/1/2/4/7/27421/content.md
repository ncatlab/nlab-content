## Idea

A *bipointed set* is a  [[set]] $S$ equipped with the choice of a [[pair]] $s_1, s_2 \in S$ of its [[elements]], hence with a [[function]] $(s_1, s_2) \colon \mathbb{2} \to S$ from the [[boolean domain]].

Equivalently, this is a  [[bi-pointed object]] [[internalization|in]] the [[category of sets]].  

Naturally occuring examples of bi-pointed sets include (the [[underlying sets]] of [[rigs]], [[rings]], [[lattices]], [[frames]], [[pointed abelian groups]], [[absorption monoids]], [[bounded total orders]], [[closed midpoint algebras]], [[scales]], and [[interval coalgebras]], which are all bipointed by the elements usually denoted "0" and "1"  

## Properties

The [[boolean domain]] is the [[initial object|initial]] bi-pointed set, and the trivial bi-pointed set is the [[terminal object|terminal]] bi-pointed set.
