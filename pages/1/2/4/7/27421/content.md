## Idea

A [[set]] with two elements. Equivalently, a [[bi-pointed object]] in the [[category of sets]]. Equivalently, a [[pointed set]] $A$ with a point-preserving function $\mathbb{2} \to A$ from the [[boolean domain]]. 

A bi-pointed set $S$ is **trivial** if the two elements $0, 1 \in S$ are [[equal]] to each other $(0 = 1)$, and it is **non-trivial** if they are not equal to each other $(0 \neq 1)$.  

Examples of bi-pointed sets include [[rigs]], [[rings]], [[lattices]], [[frames]], [[pointed abelian groups]], [[absorption monoids]], [[bounded total orders]], [[closed midpoint algebras]], [[scales]], and [[interval coalgebras]]. 

## Properties

The [[boolean domain]] is the [[initial object|initial]] bi-pointed set, and the trivial bi-pointed set is the [[terminal object|terminal]] bi-pointed set.
