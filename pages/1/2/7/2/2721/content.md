#Idea#


For every [[Lie algebra]] or [[L-infinity algebra|∞-Lie algebra|]] or [[Lie ∞-algebroid|∞-Lie algebroid]] $mathfrak{a}$ there is its [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] $CE(\mathfrak{a})$ and its [[Weil algebra]] $W(\mathfrak{a})$ and a [[dg-algebra]] morphism

$$
  CE(\mathfrak{a}) \leftarrow W(\mathfrak{a})
  \,.
$$ 

The [[dg-algebra]] $inv(\mathfrak{a})$ of **invariant polynomials** on $\mathfrak{a}$ sits in the [[kernel]] of this map

$$
  CE(\mathfrak{a}) \leftarrow W(\mathfrak{a})
  \leftarrow
  inv(\mathfrak{a})
  \,.
$$ 


#Definition for ordinary Lie algebras#

For $\mathfrak{g}$ a [[Lie algebra]] with [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] $CE(\mathfrak{g})$ and [[Weil algebra]] $W(\mathfrak{g})$, an invariant polynomial on $\mathfrak{g}$ is an elements $P \in W(\mathfrak{a})$ with the property that

* $P$ is a wedge product of generators in the shifted copy of $C^\infty(\mathfrak{g})$ in $W(\mathfrak{g})$;

* it is closed in $W(\mathfrak{g})$ in that $d_{W(\mathfrak{g})} P = 0$



# Definition for $\infty$-Lie algebroids #

For $\mathfrak{a}$ a [[Lie infinity-algebroid]] with [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] $CE(\mathfrak{a})$ and [[Weil algebra]] $W(\mathfrak{a})$, the [[dg-algebra]] of **invariant polynomials** on $\mathfrak{a}$ is the sub-[[dg-algebra]] of $W(\mathfrak{a})$ generated by those elements $P \in W(\mathfrak{a})$ with the property that

* $P$ is a wedge product of generators in the shifted copy of $C^\infty(\mathfrak{a})$ in $W(\mathfrak{a})$;

* it is closed in $W(\mathfrak{g})$ in that $d_{W(\mathfrak{g})} P = 0$
