There are many Witten conjectures; by this name however most often one refers to a conjecture proved by Kontsevich in

* [[Maxim Konstevich]], _Intersection theory on the moduli space of curves and the matrix Airy function_, Comm. Math. Phys. __147__ (1992), no. 1, 1--23, [euclid](http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.cmp/1104250524), [author's pdf](http://193.51.104.7/~maxim/TEXTS/intersection_theory_6.pdf)

It is about a generating function for intersection numbers of Mumford-Morita-Miller stable classes on the compactification of moduli space of punctured curves; the conjecture relates them to the Korteweg-de Vries integrable hierarchy. It is conjectured by Witten based on the conjectured equivalence of two approaches to quantum gravity, which do not seem to be mathematically a priori anyhow related. 

Very instructive summary is by Claude Itzykson appeared in [MR93e:32027](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=93e:32027) and a detailed introduction with accessible proofs is in 

* Ali Ulas Ozgur Kisisel,  _Integrable systems and Gromov-Witten theory_,   p. 135--161 in: Topics in cohomological studies of algebraic varieties, 
Impanga lecture notes. Edited by Piotr Pragacz. Trends Math., Birkh&#228;user, Basel, 2005, [MR2006d:14066](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=2006d:14066)

Gregory Naber's lectures on Witten conjecture can be found at his [homepage](http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~gln22).

Some of the newer approaches to the proof:

* M. E. Kazarian, S. K. Lando, _An algebro-geometric proof of Witten's conjecture_

and also versions for higher spin

* Tyler J.Jarvis, Takashi Kimura, Arkady Vaintrob, _Moduli spaces of higher spin curves and integrable hierarchies_, Compositio Math. __126__ (2001),  no. 2, 157--212.
