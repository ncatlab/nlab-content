## Idea ##


In [[type theory]], _induction-induction_ is a principle for mutually defining [[types]] of the form

$$
  A \colon Type\,,\;\;\; and \;\;\; B \colon A \to Type
  \,,
$$ 

where both $A$ and $B$ are [[inductive types|defined inductively]], such that the constructors for $A$ can refer to $B$ and vice versa. In addition, the constructor for $B$ can refer to the constructor for $A$. 

Such induction-induction occurs for instance when formalising [[dependent type theory]] in [[type theory]].

## Results ##

Inductive-inductive types are related to [[inductive-recursive types]]. Importantly, inductive-inductive types have an initial algebra semantics with respect to [[dialgebras]]. In [Forsberg's thesis](#ForsbergThesis) inductive-inductive types are reduced to [[indexed inductive types]] in the setting of extensional type theory. This reduction however only provides "simple" elimination rules (not to be confused with _simply typed_). Indexed inductive types in turn can be reduced to [[W-types]] in extensional type theory. See [[inductive families]].

The consistency of the framework used for the elimination (e.g. in the [[theorem prover]] [[Agda]]) is not so clear, as it allows the definition of a universe containing a code for itself. There is an axiomatisation of the new principle in such a way that the resulting type theory is consistent, as proved by constructing a set-theoretic model; see [Forsberg-Setzer 10](#ForsbergSetzer10).

[Hugunin](#Hugunin19) provides a reduction of an inductive-inductive type to an inductive type. This construction is conjectured to generalize to all inductive-inductive types. The construction is done in [[cubical type theory]] and hence is consistent with [[homotopy type theory]].

## Higher inductive inductive types ##

Experiments with higher inductive inductive types (elaborate versions of [[higher inductive types]]) are sections 11.3 "Cauchy reals" and section 11.6 "Conway surreals"  of the [HoTT book](#HoTTBook) (cf. the *[[HoTT book real numbers]]*). As they are at the set level, these are instances of [[quotient inductive type|quotient inductive-inductive types]]; see [QIIT](#QIIT). An experimental syntax for HIITs by [Kaposi and Kovacs](#KaposiKovacs).

Another example of a higher inductive-inductive type is a [[univalent Tarski universe]], where the where a type $U$ is defined inductively together with a [[type family]] $a:U \vdash T(a) \; \mathrm{type}$ and has constructors 

* an element $h(a, b, f):\mathrm{fiber}(\mathrm{transport}^T(a, b), f)$ for all $a:U$, $b:U$, $f:T(a) \simeq T(b)$
* an identity $\mathrm{ua}(a, b, f, c):c =_{\mathrm{fiber}(\mathrm{transport}^T(a, b), f} h(a, b, f)$ for all $a:U$, $b:U$, $f:T(a) \simeq T(b)$ and $c:\mathrm{fiber}(\mathrm{transport}^T(a, b), f)$

where $\mathrm{transport}^T(a, b):(a =_U b) \to (T(a) \simeq T(b))$ is the [[transport]] function for all $a:U$ and $b:U$ and 
$$\mathrm{fiber}(\mathrm{transport}^T(a, b), f) \coloneqq \sum_{p:a =_U b} \mathrm{transport}^T(a, b)(p) =_{T(a) \simeq T(b)} f$$

This means that $h(a, b, f)$ is the [[center of contraction]] of the fiber of transport across $T$ at the equivalence $f:T(a) \simeq T(b)$.
