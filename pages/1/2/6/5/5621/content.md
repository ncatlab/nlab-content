## Definition

A [[2-functor]] $F \,\colon\, C \to D$ exhibits the [[2-category]] $C$ as a **full sub-2-category** of $D$ if for all [[object]]s $c_1,c_2 \in C$ the component [[functor]] $F_{c_1, c_2}$ is an [[equivalence of categories]]

$$
  F_{c_1, c_2} 
  \;\colon\; 
  C(c_1,c_2) 
  \xrightarrow{\;\; \simeq \;\;} 
  D\big(
    F(c_1), F(c_2)
  \big)
  \,,
$$

hence if $F$ is a **2-fully-faithful 2-functor**.

## Properties

$C$ and $D$ can be considered as (1-)categories by forgetting their 2-morphisms, and $F$ can be considered as a (1-)functor via [[decategorification]]. As a result, every full sub-2-category is also a full subcategory.

If $D$ is a [[(2,1)-category]] a full sub-2-category is equivalently a [[full sub-(âˆž,1)-category]].
