Patrick Dehornoy (born 1952) is a French mathematician who is widely known for his work on the ordering of the [[braid group]].[^fine]

[^fine]: Dehornoy is sometimes considered to be the first discoverer of such an ordering in the early 90s, but in view of Langmaack's work in the late 60s this needs some qualification.
