**Krzysztof Gaw&#281;dzki** is a mathematical physicist. Much of his works is related to [[conformal field theory]], especially geometric aspects of WZNW models. More recently he studies turbulence. He has identified the [[Kalb-Ramond field]] with a Deligne cohomology class.

Polish &#281; (cf. [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_alphabet)) has a nazalization.
