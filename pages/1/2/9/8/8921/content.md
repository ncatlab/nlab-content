## Idea

The [[standard model of cosmology]] including [[dark energy]] and [[dark matter]] is in very good agreement with observation on scales above those of galaxies, but in its standard version becomes problematic below this scale (there are variants that address this, such as [[fuzzy dark matter]]).

Curiously though, the particular behaviour of experimental data on these "small" cosmological scales turns out to have a remarkably simple and universal phenomenological fit by a simple modification of the [[force]] law of [[Newtonian mechanics]] ("Newton's third law", corrections from [[general relativity]] are typically very small for the effects in question). 

_MOND_ is the abbreviation for this _modified Newtonian dynamics_ ([Milgrom 83 a](#Milgrom83a), [Milgrom 83 b](#Milgrom83b), [Milgrom 83 c](#Milgrom83c)). This refers to the proposal of modifying Newton's third law 

$$
  F = m a
$$

relating the [[force]] experienced by a body of [[mass]] $m$ to its [[acceleration]] $a$ by an expression of the form

$$
  F = m \,\mu(a/a_0)\, a
$$

for some acceleration scale $a_0$ and some interpolating function $\mu \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$.

The motivation is that choosing the constant $a_0$ and the function $\mu$ suitably, then such a modified formula fits the rotation-velocities of observed [[galaxies]] in dependence of the [[radius]] remarkably well, something which the [[standard model of cosmology]] with [[dark matter]] still has some problems with (but see [Kaplinghat-Turner 02](#KaplinghatTurner02), [BLSF 09](#BLSF09), [Chan 13](#Chan13)). 

In 2020, David Merritt wrote a review of MOND and dark matter which stated that the observational evidence favors MOND over dark matter ([Merritt20](#Merritt20)). 

## Relativistic extensions of MOND

The original MOND model by Milgrom is an ad-hoc such modification of the basic laws of physics and breaks many established properties of physics, such as the [[principle of equivalence]] in [[general relativity]] and various [[conservation laws]]. Thus, many theories have been developed to reconcile MOND with relativity, including:

* Tensor-Vector-Scalar gravity ([Bekenstein 04](#Bekenstein04), "TeVeS") 

* Aether scalar tensor theory ([SkordisZlosnik21](#SkordisZlosnik21), [SkordisZlosnik22](#SkordisZlosnik22), [MMH23](#MMH23), "AeST)

* Bimetric MOND ([Milgrom22](#Milgrom22))

* Khronometric MOND ([Flanagan23](#Flanagan23))

In addition, there are also studies of relativistic MOND gravity in general ([TMZ23](#TMZ23), [THCZ23](#THCZ23)). 

{#TheseTheories} These theories tend to postulate new [[relativistic field theory|relativistic]] [[field (physics)|fields]] adjoined to plain [[Einstein gravity]]. While the [[relativistic field theory|relativistic]] [[interactions]] of these hypothetical new fields is designed to mimic the originally postulated MOdfied Newtonian Dynamics in appropriate regime, to be [[phenomenology|phenomenologically]] viable they must otherwise be effectively unobservable and as such are rather like the [[dark matter]] [[field (physics)|fields]] whose introduction the original idea of MOND it was to avoid. Therefore, the difference between the oxymoronic "relativistic MOND" and mainstream [[dark matter]] is now more one of style and focus than of principle.


### Tensor-Vector-Scalar gravity

The first such proposal for such a theory apart from [[gravity]]+[[dark matter]] itself ([Kaplinghat-Turner 02](#KaplinghatTurner02), [BLSF 09](#BLSF09), [Chan 13](#Chan13)) is to add to Einstein gravity a unit vector field and a [[scalar field]] ([Bekenstein 04](#Bekenstein04), "TeVeS"), themselves thus otherwise unobserved "dark fields", as it were,  but, as opposed to say the [[axion]] dark matter candidate, not motivated beyond the desire to fit galaxy rotation curves.

From [Bekenstein 04, p. 9](#Bekenstein04) one sees explicitly that TeVeS is just Einstein-gravity coupled to peculiar "matter" fields:

## Related concepts

* An alternative proposal is that of [[fuzzy dark matter]], where the theory of gravity is left as is, but one assumes that there is [[dark matter]] which is so extremely light that its [[de Broglie wavelength]] is of the scales of galaxies. Such [[fuzzy dark matter]] models make the same prediction as cold dark matter on cosmological scales, but change behaviour on scales of galaxies due to the [[quantum physics|quantum]] nature of these light particles becoming relevant here. This change of behaviour has been argued to account for the kind of effects that MOND is a fit for.

> Regardless of the formation history of NGC1052–DF2, its existence has implications for the dark matter paradigm. Our results demonstrate that dark matter is separable from galaxies, which is (under certain circumstances) expected if it is bound to baryons through nothing but gravity. The "[[bullet cluster]]" demonstrates that dark matter does not always trace the bulk of the baryonic mass, which in clusters is in the form of gas.  NGC1052–DF2 enables us to make the complementary point that dark matter does not always coincide with galaxies either:  it is a distinct "substance" that may or may not be present in a galaxy.   Furthermore,  and paradoxically, the existence of NGC1052–DF2 may falsify
alternatives to dark matter. In theories such as [[MOND]] and the recently proposed emergent gravity paradigm a "dark matter" signature should always be detected, as it is an unavoidable consequence of the presence of ordinary matter. In fact, it had been argued previously that the apparent absence of galaxies such as NGC1052–DF2 constituted a falsification of the standard cosmological model, and evidence for modified gravity.
