## Idea

_MOND_ is the abbreviation for _modified Newtonian gravity_. This refers to a simple formula that formally modifies the formula for Newtonian [[gravity]] in a way that surprisingly well fits the rotation-velocities of observed [[galaxies]] in dependece of the radius, something which the [[standard model of cosmology]] with [[dark matter]] still has some problems with fitting properly. 

There is no consensus as to what this modification of Newtonian gravity _means_. It must be a numerical fit to some kind of physics that is to date not understood more fundamentally.

## Related concepts

* An alternative proposal is that of [[fuzzy dark matter]], where the theory of gravity is left as is, but one assumes that there is [[dark matter]] which is so extremely light that its [[de Broglie wavelength]] is of the scales of galaxies. Such [[fuzzy dark matter]] models make the ame prediction as cold dark matter on cosmological scales, but changes behaviour on scales of galaxies due to the [[quantum physics|quantum]] nature of these light particles becoming relevant here. This change of behaviour has been argued to account for the kind of effects that MOND is a fit for.
