###### Definition (triangulated subcategory)


A **triangulated subcategory** $A$ of a [[triangulated category]] $B$ is a nonempty [[subcategory]] closed under suspension of objects and such that for all objects $X,Y$ in $A$ if $X\to Y\to Z\to X[1]$ is a distinguished triangle in $B$, then $Z$ is in $A$.  

A triangulated subcategory $A$ is called **thick** if with any object in $A$ it contains all its direct summands in $B$.

###### Definition (Verdier quotient)


For $A \subset B$ a triangulated subcategory, the [[Verdier quotient]] category $B/A$ which is a triangulated category equipped with a canonical functor $Q^*:B\to B/A$ that is also triangulated (additive and preserving distinguished triangles) and universal among all triangulated functors $B\to D$ which send objects of $A$ to objects isomorphic to $0$.

The Verdier quotient $B/A$  has the property that the only objects whose images in $B/A$ are isomorphic to the [[zero object]] are the objects from $A$.

###### Definition (Bousfield localization)


Given a thick subcategory $A\subset B$, we say that the **Bousfield localization** exists if the Verdier quotient functor $Q^*$ has a right [[adjoint functor]] $Q_*$ which is then (automatically) triangulated and fully faithful.

To amplify, writing $B_{loc} := B/A$ a Bousfield localization of a triangulated category $B$ is in particular an [[adjunction]]

$$
  B_{loc} \stackrel{\stackrel{}{\leftarrow}}{\hookrightarrow}
  B
  \,.
$$

Compare this to [[Bousfield localization of model categories]], noticing that most triangulated categories arise as [[homotopy category of an (infinity,1)-category|homotopy categories]] of [[stable (infinity,1)-category|stable (âˆž,1)-categories]], hence of [[homotopy category|homotopy categories]] of the [[model category|model categories]] presenting these.  

Also note, to a tensored, triangulated category, one may associate a [[Bousfield Lattice]] which has deep connections to the above topic.
