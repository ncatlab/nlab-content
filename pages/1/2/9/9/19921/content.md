## Idea

In [[proof theory]], the **Dialectica interpretation** is a proof interpretation of intuitionistic arithmetic ([[Heyting arithmetic]]) into a finite type extension of [[primitive recursive arithmetic]].  It was reinterpreted by [de Paiva](#DePaiva) as a construction (actually, multiple related constructions) on [[categories]], related to (but distinct from) the [[Chu construction]].

## Examples

* Certain cardinal invariants of the continuum in [[ZFC]] [[set theory]] can be expressed and proven using Dialectica categories; see [da Silva and de Paiva](#dsdp).
