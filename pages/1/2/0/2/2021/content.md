Suppose we are given a (not neccesarily commutative) unital ring $R$. A left $R$-module $M$ is __finitely generated__ if there is an exact sequence $R^n\to M\to 0$ of left $R$-modules where $n$ is a natural number. $M$ is noetherian $R$-module if each $R$-submodule $N\subset M$ is finitely generated. A ring is [[noetherian ring|noetherian]] if it is noetherian as a left $R$-module. 

A left $R$-module $M$ is __finitely presented__ (or of finite presentation) if there exist an exact sequence $R^q\to R^p\to M\to 0$ where $p,q$ are finite. A left __coherent module__ is a left $R$-module which is finitely generated and such that every $R$-submodule $N\subset M$ is finitely presented. 

Coherent modules behave well over noetherian rings.

A geometric globalization of a notion of coherent module is a notion of a [[coherent sheaf]] of $\mathcal{O}$-modules for a ringed space $(X,\mathcal{O})$.
