## Definition

Suppose we are given a (not necessarily commutative) [[unital ring]] $R$. A left $R$-[[module]] $M$ is __finitely generated__ if there is an [[exact sequence]] $R^n\to M\to 0$ of left $R$-modules where $n$ is a [[natural number]]. 

A left $R$-module $M$ is __finitely presented__ (or of finite presentation) if there exists an exact sequence $R^q\to R^p\to M\to 0$ where $p,q$ are natural numbers. A left __coherent module__ is a left $R$-module which is finitely generated and such that every finitely generated $R$-submodule $N\subset M$ is finitely presented (equivalently: such that the kernel of any morphism $R^n \to M$ is finitely generated).

Coherent modules behave well over [[noetherian rings]] and to some extent more generally over [[coherent rings]].

A geometric globalization of a notion of coherent module is a notion of a [[coherent sheaf]] of $\mathcal{O}$-modules for a ringed space $(X,\mathcal{O})$.
