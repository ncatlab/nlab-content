## Idea

Under the identification of [[homotopy types]] of [[topological spaces]] with [[simplicial sets]]/[[Kan complexes]] (see at _[[homotopy hypothesis]]_) there is a standard construction ([Kan 58](#Kan58)) traditionally denoted $G$, for the [[loop space]] $\Omega X$ of a [[connected topological space]] as a [[simplicial group]]. It is the [[left adjoint]] in an [[adjunction]]

$$
  (G \dashv \overline{W}) 
    \;\colon\;
  sSet_0 
    \underoverset
      {\underset{\overline{W}}{\longrightarrow}}
      {\overset{G}{\longleftarrow}}
      {\bot}
  sGrp
$$

between [[reduced simplicial sets]] and [[simplicial groups]], whose [[right adjoint]] is the simplicial [[classifying space]] construction.

The generalization of this construction to non-reduced simplicial sets and [[simplicial groupoids]] is the [[Dwyer-Kan loop groupoid]] functor.
