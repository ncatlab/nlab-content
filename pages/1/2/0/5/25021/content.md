## Idea

Prime power local rings are the integers modulo $n$ which are local rings, in the same way that [[prime fields]] are the integers modulo $n$ which are fields. 

## Definition

For $p \geq 2$ a [[prime number]] and for $n \geq 1$ a positive [[natural number]], the [[quotient]] $\mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z}$ of the [[ring]] of [[integers]] by the [[prime power]] $p^n$ is a [[local ring]], a **prime power local ring**. 

## Properties

The [[ideal]] of non-invertible elements is the ideal $p(\mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z})$, and the quotient of $\mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z}$ by the ideal of non-invertible elements is the [[prime field]] $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$. Since the ideal of non-invertible elements is a [[nilradical]], every prime power local ring is an [[Artinian ring]], which implies that it is a [[local Artinian ring]]. 

The underlying [[abelian group]] of a prime power local ring is a [[p-primary group]]. 

The cardinality of the [[group of units]] of $\mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z}$ (the [[Euler totient function]] $\phi(p^n)$) is given by $\phi(p^n) = p^{n - 1} (p - 1)$. 

In addition, every prime power local ring with [[trivial nilradical]] is a [[prime field]].
