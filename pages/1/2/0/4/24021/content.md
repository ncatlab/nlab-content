## Idea

The collection of [[two-sided ideals]] in a [[ring]], which happens to have a structure of a [[concrete category]]. 

## Definition

Given a [[ring]] $R$ in a [[universe]] $\mathcal{U}$, the **category of [[two-sided ideals]]** in $R$ in $\mathcal{U}$ is a [[large category|$\mathcal{U}$-large]] but [[locally small category|locally $\mathcal{U}$-small]] [[bicomplete category|$\mathcal{U}$-small-bicomplete]] [[concrete category|concrete]] [[thin category]] $\mathrm{TwoSidedIdeals}_\mathcal{U}(R)$ whose [[objects]] are the [[two-sided ideals]] in $R$ in $\mathcal{U}$, the [[subbimodule|sub-$R$-$R$-bimodules]] of $R$ in $\mathcal{U}$, and whose [[morphisms]] are the $R$-$R$-[[bimodule monomorphisms]] $f:I \hookrightarrow J$ between two-sided ideals $I$ and $J$ in $R$ in $\mathcal{U}$. 

## Properties 

The category comes with a [[faithful functor]] $F_{R}:\mathrm{TwoSidedIdeals}_\mathcal{U}(R) \to \mathrm{Bimod}_{R,R}$. 

Given a subset $S \subseteq R$ with an [[injection]] $i:S \hookrightarrow R$, [[generalized the|the]] two-sided ideal $I_S$ **generated by** $S$ is defined as the [[initial object|initial]] two-sided ideal in $R$ with a function $j:S \to I_S$. This initial object always exists because $\mathrm{TwoSidedIdeals}_\mathcal{U}(R)$ is $\mathcal{U}$-small-complete, which means that the [[pullback]] of any $\mathcal{U}$-small [[family]] of $R$-$R$-bimodule monomorphisms with codomain $R$ exists, and thus arbitrary [[intersections]] of two-sided ideals of $R$ exists. $S$ is called a **[[subbase]]**. If $S$ is a [[singleton]], then $I_S$ is called a **[[principal ideal|principal two-sided ideal]]** in $R$. 

$R$ is [[generalized the|the]] **improper two-sided ideal in $R$**, the [[terminal object]] in $\mathrm{TwoSidedIdeals}_\mathcal{U}(R)$. A **proper two-sided ideal** is a two-sided ideal $I$ with a [[function]] from the [[set]] $I \cong R$ of $R$-$R$-[[bimodule isomorphisms]] between $I$ and $R$ to the [[empty set]] $f: (I \cong R) \to \emptyset$.
