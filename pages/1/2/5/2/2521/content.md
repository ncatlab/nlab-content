As ordinary [[differential geometry]] studies spaces -- [[manifold]]s -- that locally look like [[vector space]]s, supergeometry studies spaces -- [[supermanifold]]s -- that locally look like [[super vector space]]s.


As ordinary [[algebraic geometry]] studies spaces -- [[scheme]]s -- that locally look like [[affine space]]s, supergeometry studies [[superscheme]]s.

From the point of view of [[noncommutative geometry]], the supergeometry is a very mild special case of noncommutativity in geometry: some coordinates commute, some anticommute.
