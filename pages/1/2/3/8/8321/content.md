{: toc}

## Idea

In [[logic]], the _weakening rule_ states that [[premise]]s may be added to the hypotheses of a valid [[deduction]] while remaining valid.  Along with the [[contraction rule]] and the [[exchange rule]], it is one of the most commonly adopted [[structural rules]]. (See also *[[context extension]]*.)

The weakening rule is not used in all [[logical frameworks]], for instance in [[linear logic]] it is discarded.

## Statements

Exactly how this looks depends on the [[logic]] used.

...

## Semantics

This corresponds to having [[semicartesian monoidal category|projections for the monoidal structure]] that corresponds to the logical binary operator at hand.
