# The weakening rule

## Idea

In [[formal logic]] and [[type theory]], by "weakening rules" one means [[inference rules]] for [[context extension]],
which state that any [[premises]] may be added to the [[hypotheses]] ([[antecedents]]) of a valid [[judgement]].

Along with the [[variable rule]], the [[contraction rule]] and the [[exchange rule]], the weakening rule is one of the most commonly adopted [[structural rules]]. But the weakening rule is not used in all [[logical frameworks]], for instance in [[linear logic]] it is discarded.

Concretely, in [[intuitionistic type theory|intuitionistic]] [[dependent type theory]] the weakening rule is the [[inference rule]]

$$
  W
  \frac{
    \Gamma
    ,\,
    \Delta
    \;
      \vdash
    \;
    j \colon J
    \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
    \Gamma
    \;
      \vdash
    \;
    A \colon Type
  }{
    \Gamma
    ,\;
    A 
    ,\,
    \Delta
    \;
    \vdash
    \;
    j \colon J
  }
$$

As usual in [[dependent type theory]], the meaning of this rule is a little less trivial than it may superficially seem, due to the generic [[dependent type|type dependency]] involved: In [[context extension|extending the contents]] in the [[antecedent]] we are implicitly making the [[succedent]] [[dependent type|depend]] on this extended context, albeit trivially.

Accordingly, in the [[categorical semantics]] [[categorical semantics of dependent types|of dependent types]] the weakening rule corresponds to [[pullback]] of [[bundles]]/[[display maps]] to the [[fiber product]] which interprets the extended context:

## Semantics

Weakening rules correspond to having [[semicartesian monoidal category|projections for the monoidal structure]] that corresponds to the logical binary operator at hand.
