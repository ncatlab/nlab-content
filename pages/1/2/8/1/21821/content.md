## Idea


The _M5-brane elliptic genus_ is the [[elliptic genus]] imagined to arise as the [[M5-brane]] [[partition function]] when the [[M5-brane]] [[worldvolume]]-theory is seen as a [[2d SCFT]] after [[KK-compactification]] on a [[4-manifold]]/[[complex surface]] (as in the [[AGT correspondence]]).
