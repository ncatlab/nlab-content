# Idea #

A [[chain complex]] in non-negative degree is, under the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] a [[homological algebra]] model for a particularly nice [[topological space]] or [[∞-groupoid]]: namely one with an abelian group structure on it.
+--{: .query}
[[David Roberts]]: Should this be _of the homotopy type of an abelian topological group_? Or an $E_\infty$-algebra?

[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: I thought the statement (at least the strictest version of what that statement can be) of the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] is that non-negatively graded chain complexes of abelian groups are equivalent to simplicial sets internal to abelian groups. Since these are necessarily Kan complexes, I phrased this as "$\infty$-groupoids with abelian group structure" (strict abelian group structure, that is). 

So these in particular have the homotopy type of an abelian group, and in particular are special cases of $E_\infty$-spaces, but are much more restrictive, in that there is on the nose a strict abelian group structure around.

That's what I am thinking. But let me know if I am mixed up. And please feel free to improve on the presentation here as you see the need. I don't have time for this entry right now, will try to come back to it later.

Accordingly, an unbounded (arbitrary) [[chain complex]] is a model for a [[spectrum]] with abelian group structure. 

One consequence of this embedding

$$
  N : Ch_+ \to \infty Grpd
$$

induced by the Dold-Kan [[nerve]] is that it allows to think of [[chain complexes]] as objects in the [[(∞,1)-topos]] [[∞Grpd]] or equivalently [[Top]]. Every [[(∞,1)-topos]] comes with a notion of [[homotopy]] and [[cohomology]] and so such abstract notions get induced on chain complexes.

Of course there is an independent, age-old definition of [[homology]] of chain complexes and, by dualization, of cohomology of cochain complexes. 

This entry describes how these standard definition of chain homology and cohomology follow from the general [[(∞,1)-topos]] nonsense described at [[cohomology]] and [[homotopy]]. 

The main statement is that

* the na&#239;ve [[homology]] groups of a [[chain complex]] are really its [[homotopy groups]], in the abstract sense (i.e. with the chain complex regarded as a model for a space/$\infty$-groupoid);

* the na&#239;ve cohomology groups of a cochain complex are really the abstract [[cohomology groups]] of the dual [[chain complex]].

# Preliminaries #

Before discussing chain homology and cohomology, we fix some terms and notation.

## Eilenberg-MacLane objects ##

In a given [[(∞,1)-topos]] there is a notion of [[homotopy]] and [[cohomology]] for every (co-)coefficient object $A$ ($B$).

The particular case of [[chain complex]] [[homology]] is only the special case induced from coefficients given by the corresponding [[Eilenberg-MacLane objects]].

Assume for simplicity here and in the following that we are talking about non-negatively graded chain complexes of vector spaces over some field $k$. Then for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ write

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \mathbf{B}^n k &:=
    ( 
      \cdots
      \to 
      \mathbf{B}^n k_n
      \to  
      \cdots 
       \to \stackrel{\partial}{\to} \mathbf{B}^n k_1 
      \stackrel{\partial}{\to} \mathbf{B}^n k_0)
    \\
    &=
    (  \cdots \to k \to \cdots \to 0 \to 0 )
  \end{aligned}
$$

for the $n$th [[Eilenberg-MacLane object]]. 

Notice that this is often also denoted $k[n]$ or $k[-n]$ or $K(k,n)$.


## Homotopy and cohomology ##

With the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] understood, embedding
chain complexes into [[∞-groupoids]], for any chain complexes $X_\bullet$, $A_\bullet$ and $B_\bullet$ we obtain 

* the $\infty$-groupoid

  $$
    \mathbf{H}_{\infty Grpd}(X_\bullet, A_\bullet)
  $$

  whose 
  * objects are the $A$-valued cocycles on $X$;
  * morphisms are the coboundaries between these cocycles;
  * 2-morphisms are the coboundaries between coboundaries
  * etc.
  and where the elements of $\pi_0 \mathbf{H}(X_\bullet,A_\bullet)$ are the cohomology classes

* the $\infty$-groupoids

  $$
    \mathbf{H}_{\infty Grpd}(B_\bullet, X_\bullet)
  $$

  whose 
  * objects are the $B$-co-valued cycles on $X$;
  * morphisms are the boundaries between these cycles;
  * 2-morphisms are the boundaries between boundaries
  * etc.
  and where the elements of $\pi_0 \mathbf{H}(B_\bullet,X_\bullet)$ are the homotopy classes


# Chain homology as homotopy #

For $X_\bullet := V_\bullet$ any [[chain complex]] 
and $H_n(V_\bullet)$ its ordinary chain [[homology]] in degree $n$, we have

$$
  H_n(V_\bullet) \simeq 
  \pi_0 \mathbf{H}(\mathbf{B}^n k_\bullet, V_\bullet)
  \,.
$$

A cycle $c : \mathbf{B}^n k_\bullet \to V_\bullet$ 
is a chain map

$$
  \array{
    \cdots 
    &\stackrel{\partial}{\to}&
    0
    &\stackrel{\partial}{\to}&
    k
    &\stackrel{\partial}{\to}&
    0
    &\stackrel{\partial}{\to}&
    \cdots
    \\
    && \downarrow
    && \downarrow^{c_n}
    && \downarrow
    \\
    \cdots 
    &\stackrel{\partial}{\to}&
    V_{n+1}
    &\stackrel{\partial}{\to}&
    V_n
    &\stackrel{\partial}{\to}&
    V_{n-1}
    &\stackrel{\partial}{\to}&
    \cdots        
  }
$$

Such chain maps are clearly in bijection with those elements $c_n \in V_n$ that are in the kernel of
$V_n \stackrel{\partial}{\to} V_{n-1}$
in that $\partial c_n = 0$.

A boundary $\lambda : c \to C'$ is a chain homotopy

$$
  \array{
    \cdots 
    &\stackrel{\partial}{\to}&
    0
    &\stackrel{\partial}{\to}&
    k
    &\stackrel{\partial}{\to}&
    0
    &\stackrel{\partial}{\to}&
    \cdots
    \\
    && &
    {}^{\lambda_n}\swarrow
    \\
    \cdots 
    &\stackrel{\partial}{\to}&
    V_{n+1}
    &\stackrel{\partial}{\to}&
    V_n
    &\stackrel{\partial}{\to}&
    V_{n-1}
    &\stackrel{\partial}{\to}&
    \cdots        
  }
$$

such that $c' = c + \partial \lambda$.

# Cohomology of cochain complexes #

The ordinary notion of cohomology of a [[chain complex|cochain complex]]
is the special case of cohomology in the 
[[stable (∞,1)-category|stable (∞,1)-]] [[category of chain complexes]].

For $V^\bullet$ a cochain complex let 

$$
  \begin{aligned}
      X &:= V_\bullet = (V^\bullet)^*
      \\
      &=
      (\cdots \to X_{n+1} \stackrel{\partial}{\to}
      X_n \stackrel{\partial}{\to} X_{n-1} \to \cdots)
      \\
      & :=
      (\cdots \to V_{n+1} \stackrel{\partial}{\to}
      V_n \stackrel{\partial}{\to} V_{n-1} \to \cdots)
  \end{aligned}
$$

be the corresponding dual [[chain complex]]. Let

$$
  \begin{aligned}
     A  &:=  \mathbf{B}^n I 
     \\
     &=
     (\cdots \to A_{n+1}  \to A_n \to A_{n-1} \to \cdots )
     \\
      & =
     (\cdots \to 0  \to I \to 0 \to \cdots )
  \end{aligned}
$$ 

be the [[chain complex]] with the 
tensor unit (the ground field, say) in degree $n$ and
trivial elsewhere. Then 
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \mathbf{H}(X,A)
    &=
    Ch(V_\bullet, \mathbf{B}^n I)
  \end{aligned}
$$

has 

* as objects chain morphisms 
  $c : V_\bullet \to \mathbf{B}^n I$
  $$
    \array{
      \cdots &\to& V_{n+1} &\stackrel{\partial}{\to}& 
      V_{n} 
      &\stackrel{\partial}{\to}& V_{n-1} 
      &\to& 
      \cdots
      \\
      &&  \downarrow^{c_{n+1}}
      && \downarrow^{c_{n}}
      && \downarrow^{c_{n-1}}
      \\
      \cdots &\to& 0 &\stackrel{\partial}{\to}& 
      I 
      &\stackrel{\partial}{\to}& 0 
      &\to& 
      \cdots  
    }
    \,.
  $$
  These are in canonical bijection with 
  the elements in the kernel of $d_{n}$ of the dual
  cochain complex $V^\bullet = [V_\bullet,I]$.

* as morphism chain homotopies $\lambda : c \to c'$

  $$
    \array{
      \cdots &\to& V_{n+1} &\stackrel{\partial}{\to}& 
      V_{n} 
      &\stackrel{\partial}{\to}& V_{n-1} 
      &\to& 
      \cdots
      \\
      && 
      && 
      &{}^{\lambda}\swarrow& 
      \\
      \cdots &\to& 0 &\stackrel{\partial}{\to}& 
      I 
      &\stackrel{\partial}{\to}& 0 
      &\to& 
      \cdots  
    }
    \,.
  $$

Comparing with the general definition of cocycles and coboudnaries from above, one confirms that

* the **cocycles** are the chain maps
  $$
    V_\bullet \to I[n]_\bullet
  $$

* the **coboundaries** are the chain homotopies between these chain maps.

* the **coboundaries of coboundaries** are the second order chain homotopies between these chain homotopies.

* etc.

[[Urs Schreiber]]: Maybe it would be useful for the reader to point out and maybe reproduce which aspect of that reference is related how to the above. It seems to me that the discussion on that page 24 and following is more related to [[Postnikov system]] and eventually to the discussion of how "ordinary abelian" cohomology sits inside some nonabelian cohomology which i'd think  should eventually go to [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] or entries branched off from that.

[[Eric]]: I added the reference to page 24 because the question seemed to be the same as the one that prompted this page. I could only vaguely see the intended picture, so if the reference is not appropriate or should be changed, then someone who understands it better than me should feel free to improve it.
