##Idea

A crossed $G$-algebra is a type of $G$-[[graded algebra]], with an inner product and a 'crossed' or 'twisted' multiplication. They arise as the analogues of [[Frobenius algebras]] for 2d-[[HQFTs]], [[equivariant TQFTs]] and in slight generality in the study of symmetries of singularities.  They were introduced by [[Turaev]] in 1998. The generalised structures have been studied by [[R. Kaufmann]].


##Nomenclature
Moore and Segal do not like the term 'crossed algebra' and suggest the alternative name'Turaev algebra'.
