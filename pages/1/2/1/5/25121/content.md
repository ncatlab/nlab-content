## Idea

By *cohesive homotopy theory* we mean [[homotopy theory]] equipped with [[structure]]/[[axioms]] of [[cohesion]]: 

* While bare [[homotopy theory]] is concerned (just) with *[[discrete object|geometrically discrete]]* [[homotopy types]]/[[infinity-groupoids|$\infty$-groupoids]],

* and while [[geometric homotopy theory]] ([[(infinity,1)-topos theory|$\infty$-topos theory]]) generalizes this to "geometric homotopy types" ([[infinity-stack|$\infty$-stacks]]) for extremely general notions of "geometry",

* cohesive homotopy theory is a form of [[geometric homotopy theory]] but constrained such that the notion of geometry it encodes satisfies basic properties familiar from [[differential topology]] and [[differential cohomology]]-theory. 

[[semantics|Semantically]], cohesive homotopy theory is modeled by [[cohesive (infinity,1)-toposes|cohesive $\infty$-toposes]], while [[syntax|syntactically]] it is described by [[cohesive homotopy type theory]].

Or rather, all this pertains to the default notion of "[[cohesion]]". There are further enhancements such as to [[differential cohesion]] modeled by [[differential cohesive (infinity,1)-topos|differential cohesive $\infty$-toposes]], which reflects a richer notion of [[higher differential geometry|higher]] [[synthetic differential geometry|synthetic]] [[differential geometry]].
