A **wide subcategory** of a category $C$ is a subcategory containing all the objects of $C$. Equivalently, it is a subcategory through which the canonical functor $disc(Obj(C)) \to C$ factors.

A wide subcategory is also called a **lluf subcategory** ("lluf" being "[[full subcategory|full]]" spelled backwards).

Note that this is an [[evil]] condition (on top of whatever evil is in the term 'subcategory'); to fix this, an **essentially wide subcategory** contains at least one object from each isomorphism class of objects.
