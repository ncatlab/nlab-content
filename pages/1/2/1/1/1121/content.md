A **wide subcategory** of a category $C$ is a subcategory containing all the objects of $C$. Equivalently, it is a subcategory through which the canonical functor $disc(Obj(C)) \to C$ factors.

A wide subcategory is also called a **lluf subcategory** ("lluf" being "[[full subcategory|full]]" spelled backwards).
