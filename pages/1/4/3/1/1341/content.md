An [[object]] being **finitely presentable** or **of finite presentation** is the same as it being a [[compact object]]. See there for more details.

There is nothing there about the [[finitely presented objects]] that I know from algebra, such as finitely presented groups.  What is the connection?  ---[[Toby Bartels]]

It does say, under the "In Grp" subsection, that a finitely presented group is the same as a compact object in the category of groups, but I don't know why that's true. ---[[Owen Biesel]]

[[Mike Shulman]]: If $C$ is concrete and its forgetful functor to $Set$ preserves filtered colimits (is "finitary"), then I believe that an object of $C$ is finitely presentable in this sense iff it can be finitely presented in [[finitely presented object|this sense]].  Possibly there is more generality in which this is true.

There is also an abstract notion of "finitely generated object" meaning that $hom(X,-)$ preserves directed colimits of monomorphisms, which in the finitary-over-$Set$ case I think should be equivalent to the more concrete version.

The term "finitely presentable" or "finitely-presentable" is used for instance in

* Kashiwara, Schapira, [[Categories and Sheaves]], Definition 6.3.2;
* [[Peter Johnstone]], [[Stone Spaces]], Definition VI.1.8.
