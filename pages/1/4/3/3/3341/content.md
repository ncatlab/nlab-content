In [[higher category theory]], [adjective](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjective) **complicial** appears in two rather *different* meanings.

##Complicial as complicial sets

One meaning pertains to a special kind of [[simplicial sets]], called [[complicial sets]] which correspond to nerves of strict infinity-categories, and also to their non-strict version [[weak complicial sets]] studied by [[Dominic Verity]]. In particular complicial is much more special than simplicial in this meaning. 

##Complicial as enriched in infinite complexes

The second meaning is "pertaining to higher categories where enrichments in infinite chain complexes occurs". Namely, in [[higher  geometry]] one often looks at categories of spectra or chain complexes, or categories enriched in spectra or chain complexes. If one looks just at positive or negative chain complexes than one has more or less the standard simplicial, or infinite-categorical picture, according to the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]], but when one deals with complexes infinite in both directions, then many analogues of statements and intuition from the usual algebraic geometry does not generalize to this setup, unlike the simplicial case. Some people call such examples complicial, e.g. the French Nice/Toulouse school of derived geometry ([[Carlos Simpson]], [[Bertrand Toen]]...). At cafe, there has been some discussion of Z-categories which correspond to an equivalent setup: [link](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2007/11/this_weeks_finds_in_mathematic_22.html#c013345).
