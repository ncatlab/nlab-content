
## Idea

A certain identity for certain [[Fourier transforms]], equating a sum or integral of a function over a domain (e.g., a lattice) with a corresponding sum or integral of its Fourier dual over a dual domain (e.g., the dual lattice).

## Statement 

The Poisson summation formula is basic to harmonic analysis over general locally compact Hausdorff abelian groups. 

Consider an exact sequence in $TopAb$ of [[locally compact space|locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[topological abelian group|abelian groups]] 

$$0 \to A \to B \to C \to 0.$$ 

where $A, B, C$ are equipped with Haar measures $d\mu_A, d\mu_B, d\mu_C$ that make the following equation true: 

$$\int_B f(b)\; d\mu_B(b) = \int_C \int_A f(a + c)\; d\mu_A(a) d\mu_C(c)$$ 

for all [[continuous functions]] $f: B \to \mathbb{C}$ with [[compact support]]. 
(The inner integral on the right is a shorthand for $\int_A f(a + b)\; d\mu_A(a)$ for any $b \in B$ that maps to $c \in C$; this is well-defined since the integral is invariant under changes $b \mapsto b + a'$ within the same coset $c$.) We remark that given Haar measures $d\mu_A, d\mu_B$, there exists a Haar measure $d\mu_C$ making this Fubini-type equation true. Then, since Haar measures form a torsor over the group of positive reals with multiplication, it follows that any two of $d\mu_A, d\mu_B, d\mu_C$ determine the third. 

In this notation, the "Poisson summation formula" is the equation asserted by the following result.

###### Theorem 
Let $\widehat{C}$ denote the [[Pontryagin duality|Pontryagin dual]] of $C$, and $d\mu_{\widehat{C}}$ the dual Haar measure. For any [[Schwartz-Bruhat function]] $f: B \to \mathbb{C}$, we have 

$$\int_A f(a)\; d\mu_A = \int_{\widehat{C}} \widehat{f}(\widehat{c})\; d\mu_{\widehat{C}}$$ 

where $\widehat{f}$ is the Fourier transform of $f$, as a function on $\widehat{B}$ defined by 
$$\widehat{f}(\chi) = \int_B f(b)\overline{\chi(b)}d \mu_B(b).$$

In the special case of a [[lattice (discrete subgroup)|lattice]] $L$ inside $B$, the dual space $L^\perp = \widehat{B/L}$ is a lattice inside $\widehat{B}$, and the integrals are over discrete spaces, i.e. integration is just summation and we have 

$$\sum_{x \in L} f(x) = \frac1{\mu(B/L)} \sum_{y \in L^\perp} \widehat{f}(y)$$

where $\mu$ is the Haar measure on $B/L$ (as above). Often the measure on $B$ is chosen so that $\mu(B/L) = 1$.

The classical case is when $B$ is a [[Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$. But another case of a lattice inside locally compact abelian groups occurs in the context of [Tate's thesis](#Tate1950), where a [[global field]] is viewed as a lattice inside its [[ring of adeles]]. 

## Examples

* The Poisson summation formulation implies the [[functional equation]] for the [[Jacobi theta function]], which in turn implies that of the [[Riemann zeta function]], see at _[Riemann zeta function -- functional identity](Riemann+zeta+function#functional_equation)_.
