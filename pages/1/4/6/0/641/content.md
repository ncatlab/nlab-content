##Idea##
'Homotopy 3-type' is a special case of [[homotopy n-type]] and you are referred to that entry for the generalities.

##Discussion##
There are many useful models for a homotopy 3-type. (Assume the homotopy type is connected for simplicity.)

* [[2-crossed module]]

* [[crossed squares]]

* [[cat 2-group|cat^2 group]]

(Someone please add their favorite version of the Gray groupoid type model. I am not sure I know it well enough to do a good job of it. Also any others?}
