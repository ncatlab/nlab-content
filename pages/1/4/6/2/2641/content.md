"Unitary [[irrep]]" is a shorthand for **unitary [[irreducible representation]]** of a topological group $G$, i.e., a continuous homomorphism 

$$U: G \to U(H)$$ 

into the unitary group of a Hilbert space $H$ that is irreducible in the usual sense of representation theory. 

In this and related articles, we study such representations in the case where 

$$G = SL_2(\mathbb{C}) \ltimes \mathbb{R}^4$$ 

is the universal cover of the connected component of the identity of the [[Poincare group]], which is important in the study of [[quantum field theory]]. A more physical name for such a representation is "[[elementary particle]]", and we will often use that term in this article. (NB: "elementary particle" will always refer to the formal mathematical notion.) 

A full rounded account could become large; see the [blog discussion](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/03/unitary_representations_of_the.html), which despite its size was left in a still-nascent state. However, in a nutshell, the basic theorem is that (elementary) particles are classified up to isomorphism according to their [[mass]] and [[helicity]]; mass is a continuous parameter and helicity is a discrete parameter. 

This theorem in commonly ascribed to Eugene Wigner. In the blog discussion, John Baez wrote 

* I think he completely classified the 'positive energy' representations, which are the ones of greatest importance in physics.  This leaves out exotic, unobserved representations like negative-energy particles, tachyons and other freaks too scary to mention here. But to be honest, I'm not sure exactly how far he got. What really matters to me are the positive energy reps. I hope that we can use this blog entry as a forum to find out what Wigner proved, and understand its implications for particle physics.  If we all team up, we'll all learn a lot of stuff.

I'm not sure any of these 'freaks' are too scary to mention _here_; this is mathematics after all. In any event, John later clarified what he meant by positive energy representations: 

* Those for which time translation acts as 
$$\exp(- i H t)$$ 
where $H$ is a nonnegative, nonzero selfadjoint operator. (In physics, $H$ is called the 'Hamiltonian' or 'energy'.)
