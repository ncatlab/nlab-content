Given a notion of [[space]] and a notion of [[dimension]] assigning a [[cardinal number]] or [[ordinal number]] to each space (or at least to some of them), a space is __finite-dimensional__ if this dimension exists as a [[natural number]].  Whether one is talking about [[vector spaces]], [[topological spaces]], [[manifolds]], or whatever, finite-dimensional spaces tend to have nicer properties than arbitrary spaces (such as [[infinite-dimensional manifolds]]).

Spaces with [[fractal]] dimension may also be considered finite-dimensional, but that\'s not usually what people are talking about when they say 'finite-dimensional space'.
