## Idea

In [[homotopy type theory]] (or more generally [[intensional type theory]]), when defining a [[category]] (meaning a *1-category*), one has to decide whether to impose an [[h-level]] restriction on the [[type]] of [[objects]].  A **precategory** is a category in which *no* such restriction is imposed; thus the type of objects may be a set (i.e. a 0-type), or a 1-type, or an even higher type.

Surprisingly much [[category theory]] can be done purely with precategories, and some authors call them merely "categories".  However, there are notable differences between precategories and the familiar notion of "category" from [[set theory|set-theoretic]] foundations.  Moreover, the two do not coincide under the standard interpretation of homotopy type theory into set theory (e.g. the model in [[simplicial sets]]).  Indeed, the semantics of a precategory is the 1-categorical analogue of a [[Segal space]].

Alternative notions of "1-category" in homotopy type theory include [[strict categories]], whose type of objects is a set, and [[univalent categories]], whose type of objects is a 1-type whose identifications coincide with isomorphisms for the category structure.  The latter are generally better-behaved and include naturally-occurring examples, but the former are sometimes technically useful.

There are also "even more pre-" notions of category in intensional type theory, such as [[E-categories]].

## Definition

### With a family of morphisms

A **precategory** $\mathcal{C}$ consists of 

* a [[type]] of [[objects]] $Ob(\mathcal{C})$, 
* for each object $A:Ob(\mathcal{C})$ and $B:Ob(\mathcal{C})$, a [[set]] $Hom(A, B)$ of [[morphisms]]
* for each object $A:Ob(\mathcal{C})$, $B:Ob(\mathcal{C})$, and $C:Ob(\mathcal{C})$, a [[binary function]] 
$$(-)\circ_{A, B, C}(-) :Hom(B, C) \times Hom(A, B) \to Hom(A, C)$$
* for each object $A:Ob(\mathcal{C})$, a morphism $\mathrm{id}_A:Hom(A, A)$
* such that 
  * the composition of morphisms is [[associative]]: for each object $A:Ob(\mathcal{C})$, $B:Ob(\mathcal{C})$, $C:Ob(\mathcal{C})$, and $D:Ob(\mathcal{C})$, and for each morphism $f:Hom(A, B)$, $g:Hom(B, C)$, and $h:Hom(C, D)$, 
$$h \circ_{A, C, D} (g \circ_{A, B, C} f) = h \circ_{B, C, D} (g \circ_{A, B, D} f)$$
  * the composition of morphisms satisfies the left and right [[unit laws]]: for each object $A:Ob(\mathcal{C})$ and $B :Ob(\mathcal{C})$ and morphism $f:Hom(A, B)$, $\mathrm{id}_B \circ_{A, B, B} f = f$ and $f \circ_{A, A, B} \mathrm{id}_A = f$.

Of course, the latter two axioms are actually inhabitants of the [[identity type]], hence are data included in the definition just like the first four.  However, since each $Hom(A,B)$ is a set, such equalities are (typally) unique whenever they exist, so in most cases their presence as data can be ignored.

### With one type of morphism

A **precategory** $\mathcal{C}$ consists of 

* a [[type]] $Ob(C)$ of __[[objects]]__;

* a type $Mor(C)$ of __[[morphisms]]__ (or __arrows__);

* functions $s:Mor(C) \to Ob(C)$, called the __[[source]]__ or __domain__, and $t:Mor(C) \to Ob(C)$, called its __[[target]]__ or __codomain__, such that $s$ and $t$ are jointly 0-truncated: the type of functions $u:Mor(C) \to (Ob(C) \times Ob(C))$ such that the following conditions are met:

  * the fibers of $u$ at each pair of objects $a:Ob(C) \times Ob(C)$ is a set 

  * for the universal product projection functions $\pi_1:(Ob(C) \times Ob(C)) \to Ob(C)$ and $\pi_2:(Ob(C) \times Ob(C)) \to Ob(C)$ out of the product type and for every morphism $f:Mor(C)$, there are identifications $\mathrm{leftuniversal}(f):\pi_1(u(f)) = s(f)$ and $\mathrm{rightuniversal}(f):\pi_2(u(f)) = t(f)$

is contractible:

$$\mathrm{isContr}\left(\sum_{u:Mor(C) \to (Ob(C) \times Ob(C))} \prod_{f:Mor(C)} \mathrm{isSet}\left(\sum_{a:Ob(C) \times Ob(C)} u(f) = a\right) \times (\pi_1(u(f)) = s(f)) \times \pi_2(u(f)) = t(f)))\right)$$

This recalls the definition of a [[preorder]], where the source and target functions are required to be [[jointly monic]], i.e. jointly (-1)-truncated;

* a function 
$$(-) \circ (-): \left(\sum_{f:Mor(C)} \sum_{g:Mor(C)} t(f) = s(g)\right) \to Mor(C)$$ 
called __composition__;

* a function $id:Ob(C) \to Mor(C)$, called the __identity__;

*  such that the following properties are satisfied:

   *  source and target are respected by composition: $s(g \circ f) = s(f)$ and $t(g\circ f) = t(g)$;

   *  source and target are respected by identities: $s(1_x) = x$ and $t(1_x) = x$;

   *  composition is [[associative]]:
      $(h \circ g)\circ f = h\circ (g \circ f)$ whenever $t(f) = s(g)$ and $t(g) = s(h)$;

   *  composition satisfies the [[unit law|left and right unit laws]]:
      if $s(f) = x$ and $t(f) = y$, then $1_y \circ f = f = f \circ 1_x$.

### In simplicial type theory

In [[simplicial type theory]], a **precategory** is a [[Segal type]] in which all [[hom-types]] are [[sets]].

$$\mathrm{isPrecat}(A) \coloneqq \mathrm{isSegal}(A) \times \prod_{x:A} \prod_{y:A} \mathrm{isSet}(\mathrm{hom}_A(x, y))$$

## Remarks

* The interpretation of the notion of precategory in the model of homotopy type theory in [[simplicial sets]] yields a [[Segal space]] in which the morphism $A_1 \to A_0 \times A_0$ has homotopically discrete fibers.

* The definition of precategory is evidently a type-theoretic notion of the definition of category with [[category#AFamilyOfCollectionsOfMorphisms|a family of collections of morphisms]].  An equivalent definition analogous to the definition of category with [[category#OneCollectionOfMorphisms|one collection of morphisms]] could be given, but it would be much less convenient to use.  In particular, the "type of all morphisms" $\sum_{A,B:Ob(\mathcal{C})} Hom(A,B)$ in a precategory is *not* itself a set, since it can incorporate nontrivial identifications from $Ob(\mathcal{C})$; the "hom-types are sets" condition in a one-type-of-morphisms definition of precategory would have to be stated as "the function $\mathcal{C}_1 \to \mathcal{C}_0$ is 0-truncated" (i.e. its fibers are sets).

## Properties

Every **precategory** is a locally univalent [[E-category]]. 

In [[univalent type theory]] there is a [[structure identity principle]] for precategories:

Equality of precategories in a univalent universe is the same as having a [[fully faithful]] [[equivalent-on-objects functor]] between precategories in the univalent universe. 

This is because fully faithful functors establish an equivalence of hom-sets between the two precategories, and equivalent-on-objects functors establish an equivalence of object types between the two precategories, which means that fully faithful equivalent-on-objects functors is the right notion of equivalence between precategories. 

Only in univalent categories are such functors the same as [[adjoint equivalence]].
