on a [[formal proof]] of the [[Blakers-Massey theorem]] in [[homotopy type theory]].

> **Abstract.** This paper continues investigations in "[[synthetic homotopy theory]]": the use of [[homotopy type theory]] to give [[proof assistant|machine-checked proofs]] of constructions from [[homotopy theory]]. We present a mechanized proof of the [[Blakers-Massey theorem|Blakers-Massey connectivity theorem]], a result relating the higher-dimensional [[homotopy groups]] of a [[pushout type]] (roughly, a space constructed by gluing two spaces along a shared subspace) to those of the components of the pushout. This theorem gives important information about the pushout type, and has a number of useful corollaries, including the [[Freudenthal suspension theorem]], which has been studied in previous formalizations. 
The new proof is more elementary than existing ones in abstract homotopy-theoretic settings, and the mechanization is concise and high-level, thanks to novel combinations of ideas from [[homotopy theory]] and [[type theory]].
