## Idea

The [[standard model of particle physics]] asserts that the fundamental quantum [[field (physics)|physical fields]] and [[particles]] are modeled as [[sections]] of and [[connection on a bundle|connections]] on a [[vector bundle]] that is [[associated bundle|associated]] to a $G$-[[principal bundle]], where the [[Lie group]] $G$ -- called the [[gauge group]] -- is  the [[product]] of ([[special unitary group|special]]) [[unitary groups]] $G = SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)$ (or rather a [[quotient]] of this by $Z_6$) and where the [[representation]] of $G$ used to form the associated vector bundle looks fairly ad hoc on first sight.

A **grand unified theory** ("GUT" for short) in this context is an attempt to realize the standard model as sitting inside a conceptually simpler [[model (in particle physics)|model]], in particular one for which the [[gauge group]] is a bigger but _simpler_ group $\hat{G}$, preferably a [[simple group]] in the technical sense, which contains $G$ as a [[subgroup]]. Such a grand unified theory would be [[phenomenology|phenomenologically]] viable if a process of [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] at some high [[energy]] scale -- the "GUT scale" -- would reduce the model back to the [[standard model of particle physics]] without adding spurious extra effects that would not be in agreement with existing observations in [[experiment]].

The terminology "grand unified" here refers to the fact that such a single simple group $\hat{G}$ would unify the fundamental [[forces]] of [[electromagnetism]], the [[weak nuclear force]] and the [[strong nuclear force]] in a way that generalizes the way in which the [[electroweak field]] already unifies the weak force and electromagnetism, and electromagnetism already unifies, as the word says, electricity and magnetism.

Historically, the most studied choices of GUT-groups $G$ are [[special unitary group|SU(5)]], [[spin group|Spin(10)]] (in the physics literature often referred to as [[special orthogonal group|SO(10)]]) and [[E6]] (review includes [Witten 86, sections 1 and 2](#Witten86)). 

It so happens that, mathematically, the sequence [[special unitary groups|SU(5)]], [[spin group|Spin(10)]], [[E6]] naturally continues (each step by consecutively adding a node to the [[Dynkin diagrams]]) with the [[exceptional Lie groups]] [[E7]], [[E8]] that naturally appear in [[heterotic string theory|heterotic]] [[string phenomenology]] (exposition is in [Witten 02a](#Witten02a)) and conjecturally further via the [[U-duality]] [[Kac-Moody groups]] [[E9]], [[E10]], [[E11]] that are being argued to underly [[M-theory]].

Since no GUT model has been fully validated yet (but see for instance [Fong-Meloni 14](#FongMeloni14)), GUTs are [[model (physics)|models]] "beyond the [[standard model of particle physics|standard model]]". Often quantum physics "beyond the standard model" is expected to also say something sensible about [[quantum gravity]] and hence unify not just the three gauge forces but also the fourth known fundamental force, which is [[gravity]]. Models that aim to do all of this would then "unify" the entire content of the [[standard model of particle physics]] plus the [[standard model of cosmology]], hence "everything that is known about fundamental physics" to date. Therefore such theories are then sometimes called a _[[theory of everything]]_. 

(Here it is important to remember the context, both "grand unified" and "of everything" refers to aspects of presently available models of fundamental physics, and not to deeper philosophical questions of [[ontology]].)
