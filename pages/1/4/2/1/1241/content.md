#Idea#

The [[standard model of particle physics]] asserts that the fundamental physical fields and particles are modeled as sections of and connections on a vector bundle that is associated to a $G$-principal bundle, where the [[group]] $G$ is $SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)$ (or perhaps a quotient of this by $Z_6$) and where the [[representation]] of $G$ used to form the associated vector bundle looks fairly ad hoc on first sight.

A **grand unified theory** in this context is an attempt to realize the standard model as sitting inside a conceptually simpler model, in particular one for which the structure group -- the gauge group -- is a bigger but _simpler_ group $\hat G$, preferably a [[simple group]], which contains $G$ as a subgroup.
