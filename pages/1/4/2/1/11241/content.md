## Idea

The _Church-Turing thesis_ says vaguely that what is [[computation|computable]] in the mathematical sense of [[computation]] is precisely what is [[computable physics|physically computable]].

In interpreting this one has to be careful which concept of [[computation]] is used, there are two different main types:

[[!include computable mathematics -- table]]

Indeed, there are physical processes (described by the [[wave equation]]) which are not type-I computable ([Pour-El et al. 83](#PourEl83)), but they are type-II computable ([Weihrauch-Zhong 01](WeihrauchZhong01), [Weihrauch-Zhong 02](#WeihrauchZhong02), [Weihrauch-Zhong 06](#WeihrauchZhong06)). For more on this see at _[[computable physics]]_.
