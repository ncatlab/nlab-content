## Idea

The _Church-Turing thesis_ is a (mostly informal) statement about the nature of [[computability]]. It roughly asserts that there is, up to equivalence, only one single universal concept of computability.

Slightly more in detail, the (physical) _Church-Turing thesis_ says vaguely that what is [[computation|computable]] in the mathematical sense of [[computation]] is precisely what is "effectively" computable ([[computable physics|physically computable]]).

In interpreting this one has to be careful which concept of [[computation]] is used, there are two different main types:

[[!include computable mathematics -- table]]

Indeed, there are physical processes (described by the [[wave equation]]) which are not type-I computable ([Pour-El et al. 83](#PourEl83)), but they are type-II computable ([Weihrauch-Zhong 01](WeihrauchZhong01), [Weihrauch-Zhong 02](#WeihrauchZhong02), [Weihrauch-Zhong 06](#WeihrauchZhong06)). For more on this see at _[[computable physics]]_.

One then distinguishes:

* The **physical Church-Turing thesis**: What is [[computable physics|physically computable]] is also computable in the mathematical sense of [[computability]].

* The **strong physical Church-Turing thesis**: _Every [[real number]] found by [[experiment]] in the [[observable universe]] is a [[computable real number]]_. 

  This strong version is often phrased as "the universe is a computer" or as "[digitial physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_physics)".

On the strong physical Church-Turing thesis see _[SEP -- Computation in Physical Systems -- Is every Physical system computational?](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computation-physicalsystems/#EvePhySysCom)_ for a general account and ([Waaldijk 03](#Waaldijk03)) for a more formal account emphasizing the role of [[intuitionistic mathematics|intuitionistic]]/[[constructive mathematics]].

More concretely, the kind of experiment proposed there to test whether non-computable sequences of events may appear in [[experiment]] has been claimed to have been carried out with [[quantum physics|quantum process]] in ([CDDS 10](#CDDS10)).
