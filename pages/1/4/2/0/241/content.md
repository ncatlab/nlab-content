For a given fixed category of sets $S$, a Grothendieck topos over $S$ may be defined as a category of sheaves over a site which is small relative to $S$, that is a site internal to $S$. (The site is not considered part of the structure; different sites may give rise to the same category of sheaves.) 

Verdier characterized Grothendieck toposes as categories satisfying certain exactness and small completeness properties (where "small" is again relative to the given category of sets $S$). The exactness properties are elementary (due not depend on a prior given category of sets), and are satisfied in any elementary topos.
