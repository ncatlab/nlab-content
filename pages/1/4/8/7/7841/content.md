[[!redirects Witt group]]
## Idea

A [[Witt vector]] is an infinite sequence of elements of a commutative ring $k$. There is a unique ring structure on the set $W(k)$ of Witt vectors of $k$ and $W(k)$ is therefore called *the Witt ring of $k$*. The multiplication is defined by means of [[Witt polynomials]] $w_i$ for every natural number $i$. If the characteristic of $k$ is $0$ the Witt ring of $k$ is sometimes called *universal Witt ring* to distinguish it from the case where $k$ is of prime characteristic and a similar but different construction is of interest.

A [[Witt vector|p-adic Witt vector]] is an infinite sequence of elements af a commutative ring of pime [[characteristic]] $p$. There exists a ring structure whose construction parallels that in characteristic $0$ except that only [[Witt polynomials]]  $w_{p^l}$ whose index is a power of $p$ are taken.

The assignation $W:k\to W(k)$ of a commutative ring to its Witt ring is a [[functor]].

## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition and Theorem
Let $k$ be a commutaive ring.

If the characteristic of $k$ is $0$ then the Witt ring $W(k)$ of $k$ is defined defined by the addition

$$(a_1, a_2, \ldots, )+(b_1, b_2, \ldots):=(\Sigma_1(a_1,b_1), \Sigma_2(a_1,a_2,b_1,b_2), \ldots)$$

and the multiplication

$$(a_1, a_2, \ldots )\cdot (b_1, b_2, \ldots )=(\Pi_1(a_1,b_1), \Pi_2(a_1,a_2,b_1,b_2), \ldots )$$

If $k$ is of prime characteristic $p$ we index the defining formulas by $p^1,p^2,p^3,\dots$ instead of $1,2,3,\dots$.

Here the $\Sigma_i$ (described below) are called *addition polynomials* and the $\Pi_i$ (described below) are called *multiplication polynomials*
