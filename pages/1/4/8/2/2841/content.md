A topological [[subspace]] $A$ is a **neighborhood retract** of a [[topological space]] $X$ if there is a [[neighborhood]] $U\supset A$ in $X$ such that $A$ is a [[retract]] of $U$. 

A [[metrisable space|metrisable]] topological space $Y$ is an **absolute neighborhood retract** if for any embedding $Y\subset Z$ as a [[closed subspace]] in a metrisable topological space $Z$, $Y$ is a neighborhood retract of $Z$.

A pair $(X,A)$ where $A$ is a closed subspace of $X$ is an **NDR-pair** or a (closed) Borsuk pair if there is a function $u:X\to I=[0,1]$ and a [[homotopy]] $H:X\times I\to I$ such that $H(x,0)=x$, for all $x\in X$, $H(a,t)=a$ for all $a\in A$, $H(x,1)\in A$ for all $x\in X$ such that $u(x)\lt 1$ and $u^{-1}(0)\subset A$. Every NDR-pair is a [[Hurewicz cofibration]].
