## Definition

For $S \subset X$ a [[subset]] of a [[topological space]] $X$, a, **interior point** of $S$ is a point $x \in S$ which has a [[neighbourhood]] in $X$ that is contained in $S$. The union of all interior points is the **interior** $S^\circ$ of $S$.

The complement of the interior is the [[boundary]] of $S$.
