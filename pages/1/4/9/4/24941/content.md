## Definition

In this section we work in [[dependent type theory]] with [[excluded middle]]:

$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash P \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma \vdash p:\mathrm{isProp}(P)}{\Gamma \vdash \mathrm{lem}:P \vee \neg P}$$

where $\mathrm{isProp}$ is the [[isProp]] modality and $\neg A \coloneqq A \to \emptyset$, where $\emptyset$ is the [[empty type]]. 

Our definition of the degree of a polynomial involves the formal [[partial derivative]] of a polynomial in multiple indeterminants. The idea behind the use of the partial derivative lies in the traditional conception of a polynomial as a sum of monomials, where monomoials are products of non-zero scalars and indeterminants - which have an associated exponent associated to each indeterminant because commutative rings are [[power-associative]] in [[multiplication]]. Partial derivatives are functions on polynomials which reduce the exponent of the associated indeterminant of a monomial by one and takes constant polynomials to zero; and since partial derivatives are [[linear functions]], they do it for all such instances of indeterminant powers in a polynomial. This means that after repeatedly taking partial derivatives of polynomials, the resulting polynomial will eventually reach zero. This allows us to define the degree of a polynomial using induction on the natural numbers and on lists of natural numbers, as well as composition of partial derivatives, without having to write out long formulae using indices and $\ldots$ everywhere in the definition, and without having to include additional structure with each polynomial $p$ in the form of the scalar coefficients of $p$.

I might want to switch out derivatives with shift operators, since the definition involving the derivatives only work for [[commutative rings]] with [[characteristic zero]].

J-B: Do you know the notion of [[Hasse-Schmidt derivative]]? Maybe it could work in positive characteristic.

### Polynomials in one indeterminant

Given a [[commutative ring]] $R$ with [[characteristic zero]], the commutative ring of [[polynomials]] $R[x]$ in one indeterminant $x$ is a [[higher inductive type]] generated by a type $R[x]$, a term $x:R[x]$, [[identity]] constructors which make $R[x]$ into a commutative ring, and a [[ring homomorphism]] $h:R \to R[x]$. 

The **formal derivative** $\frac{d (-)}{d x}:R[x] \to R[x]$ is inductively defined by 

* identities $\mathrm{ConstToZero}(r):\frac{d h(r)}{d x} = 0$ for all $r:R$
* identity $\mathrm{IndetToOne}:\frac{d x}{d x} = h(1)$
* identities $\mathrm{linearity}(p, q):\frac{d (p + q)}{d x} = \frac{d p}{d x} + \frac{d q}{d x}$ for all $p:R[x]$ and $q:R[x]$. 
* identities $\mathrm{LeibnizRule}(p, q):\frac{d (p \cdot q)}{d x} = \frac{d q}{d x} \cdot q + p \cdot \frac{d q}{d x}$ for all $p:R[x]$ and $q:R[x]$. 

Let $\frac{d^{(-)} (-)}{d x^{(-)}}:\mathbb{N} \to (R[X] \to R[X])$ be the function which takes a natural number $n:\mathbb{N}$ to the $n$-th derivative in the [[function set]] $R[X] \to R[X]$. This is inductively defined by the following constructors

* $\mathrm{indzero}_{d}:\frac{d^{0} (-)}{d x^{0}} = \mathrm{id}_{R[X]}$
* $\mathrm{indsucc}_{d}(n):\frac{d^{s(n)} (-)}{d x^{s(n)}} = \frac{d (-)}{d x} \circ \frac{d^{n} (-)}{d x^{n}}$ for all $n:\mathbb{N}$

Given a non-zero polynomial $p:R[x]$, the **degree** of $p$ is the maximum [[natural number]] $n$ where the $n$-th iteration of the formal [[derivative]] of $p$ is non-zero:
$$\mathrm{deg}(P) \coloneqq \max_{n:\mathbb{N}, \pi_p(n):\frac{d^{n} p}{d x^{n}} \neq 0}(n)$$

The degree of the zero polynomial is undefined, since the derivative of the zero polynomial is never non-zero. 

### Polynomials in a finite number of indeterminants

Let us define the standard [[finite set]] $\mathrm{Fin}(n)$ as the type of all [[natural numbers]] less than $n$:

$$\mathrm{Fin}(n) \coloneqq \sum_{i:\mathbb{N}} i \lt n$$

This can be proven to be an [[h-set]], hence the name "finite set". 

Given a [[commutative ring]] $R$ with [[characteristic zero]] and a natural number $n$, the commutative ring of [[polynomials]] $R[X]$ is a [[higher inductive type]] generated by a type $R[X]$, a function $X:\mathrm{Fin}(n) \to R[X]$, [[identity]] constructors which make $R[X]$ into a commutative ring, and a [[ring homomorphism]] $h:R \to R[X]$. We write $X_i$ for $X(i)$ throughout. 

The **formal partial derivative** $\frac{\partial(-)}{\partial X_{(-)}}:\mathrm{Fin}(n) \to (R[X] \to R[X])$ is inductively defined by 

* identities $\mathrm{ConstToZero}(i, r):\frac{\partial h(r)}{\partial X_i} = 0$ for all $n:\mathrm{Fin}(n)$ and $r:R$
* identities $\mathrm{IndetToOne}(i):\frac{\partial X_i}{\partial X_i} = 1$ for all $i:\mathrm{Fin}(n)$
* identities $\mathrm{linearity}(i, P, Q):\frac{\partial (P + Q)}{\partial X_i} = \frac{\partial P}{\partial X_i} + \frac{\partial Q}{\partial X_i}$ for all $i:\mathrm{Fin}(n)$, $P:R[X]$ and $Q:R[X]$. 
* identities $\mathrm{LeibnizRule}(i, P, Q):\frac{\partial (P \cdot Q)}{\partial X_i} = \frac{\partial P}{\partial X_i} \cdot Q + P \cdot \frac{\partial Q}{\partial X_i}$ for all $i:\mathrm{Fin}(n)$, $P:R[X]$ and $Q:R[X]$. 

Let $\mathrm{Fin}(n)^*$ be the [[free monoid]] on the set of natural numbers less than $n$. Every free monoid $\mathrm{Fin}(n)^*$ has a length function $\mathrm{len}:\mathrm{Fin}(n)^* \to \mathbb{N}$ which returns the number of elements in a list $a:\mathrm{Fin}(n)^*$, inductively defined by the following constructors

* $\mathrm{ptpres}_\mathrm{len}:\mathrm{len}(\epsilon) = 0$
* $\mathrm{prodpres}_\mathrm{len}(a, b):\mathrm{len}(a b) = \mathrm{len}(a) + \mathrm{len}(b)$ for all $a:\mathrm{Fin}(n)^*$ and $b:\mathrm{Fin}(n)^*$
* $\mathrm{partconst}_\mathrm{len}(i):\mathrm{len}(i) = 1$ for all $i:\mathrm{Fin}(n)$

Let $d:\mathrm{Fin}(n)^* \to (R[X] \to R[X])$ be the [[monoid homomorphism]] which takes a list $a:\mathrm{Fin}(n)^*$ of natural numbers less than $n$, to the composition of formal partial derivatives 
$$d(a) \coloneqq \frac{\partial^{\mathrm{len}(a)} (-)}{\partial X_{a_0} \partial X_{a_1} \partial X_{a_2} \ldots} \coloneqq \frac{\partial (-)}{\partial X_{a_0}} \circ \frac{\partial (-)}{\partial X_{a_1}} \circ \frac{\partial (-)}{\partial X_{a_2}} \circ \ldots$$ 
in the [[function set]] $R[X] \to R[X]$. This is inductively defined by the following constructors

* $\mathrm{ptpres}_d:d(\epsilon) = \mathrm{id}_{R[X]}$
* $\mathrm{prodpres}_d(a, b):d(a b) = d(a) \circ d(b)$ for all $a:\mathrm{Fin}(n)^*$ and $b:\mathrm{Fin}(n)^*$
* $\mathrm{partderiv}_d(i):d(i) = \frac{\partial (-)}{\partial X_i}$ for all $i:\mathrm{Fin}(n)$

Given a non-zero polynomial $P:R[x]$, the **degree** of $P$ is the maximum length of all lists $a:\mathrm{Fin}(n)^*$ of natural numbers less than $n$ such that the evaluation of $d(a)$ at $P$ is non-zero
$$\mathrm{deg}(P) \coloneqq \max_{a:\mathrm{Fin}(n)^*, \pi_p(a):d(a)(P) \neq 0}(\mathrm{len}(a))$$ 
The degree of the zero polynomial is undefined, since any composition of partial derivatives evaluated at the zero polynomial is never non-zero. 

## Homogeneous polynomials

...

Given a polynomial $p:R[x]$ in one indeterminant, it is said to be an **homogeneous polynomial** of degree $n$ if $\frac{d p}{d x}.x = n.p$ (see the [[homogeneous polynomial|Euler identity]]).

Given a polynomial $p:R[X]$ in a finite number of indeterminant, it is said to be an homogeneous polynomial of degree $n$ if $\underset{x:X}{\sum} \frac{\partial p}{\partial x}.x = n.p$.

One could also define a polynomial $p:R[X]$ to be homogeneous of degree $n$ with respect to $x:X$ if $\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}.x = n.p$. It is equivalent to the fact that $p$ can be written under the form $p=x^{n}.q$ where $q:R[X]$ is such that $\frac{\partial p}{\partial x} = 0$.

##Â In constructive mathematics

In [[constructive mathematics]], where [[excluded middle]] does not hold, the above definition is correct only if the ring $R$ has [[decidable equality]]. In more general circumstances, one has to assume that the ring $R$ is an [[inequality space]] with an apartness relation $\#$, and replace all instances of "non-zero" $p \neq 0$ with instances of "apart from zero" $p \# 0$.
