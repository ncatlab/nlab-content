### Polynomials in one indeterminant

Given a [[commutative ring]] $R$, the commutative ring of [[polynomials]] $R[x]$ in one indeterminant $x$ is a [[higher inductive type]] generated by a type $R[x]$, a term $x:R[x]$, [[identity]] constructors which make $R[x]$ into a commutative ring, and a [[ring homomorphism]] $h:R \to R[x]$. 

The **formal derivative** $\partial_x:R[x] \to R[x]$ is inductively defined by 

* identities $\mathrm{ConstToZero}(r):\partial_x (h(r)) = 0$ for all $r:R$
* identity $\mathrm{IndetToOne}:\partial_x (x) = h(1)$
* identities $\mathrm{linearity}(p, q):\partial_x (p + q) = \partial_x (p) + \partial_x (q)$ for all $p:R[x]$ and $q:R[x]$. 
* identities $\mathrm{LeibnizRule}(p, q):\partial_x (p \cdot q) = \partial_x (p) \cdot q + p \cdot \partial_x (q)$ for all $p:R[x]$ and $q:R[x]$. 

Suppose that $R$ has [[decidable equality]]. Given a non-zero polynomial $p:R[x]$, the **degree** of $p$ is the minimum [[natural number]] $n$ such that the $(n + 1)$-th iteration of the formal [[derivative]] of $p$ is equal to zero: $\partial_x^{n + 1}(p) = 0$. The degree of the zero polynomial is undefined.
