## Definition

### Polynomials in one indeterminant

Given a [[commutative ring]] $R$, the commutative ring of [[polynomials]] $R[x]$ in one indeterminant $x$ is a [[higher inductive type]] generated by a type $R[x]$, a term $x:R[x]$, [[identity]] constructors which make $R[x]$ into a commutative ring, and a [[ring homomorphism]] $h:R \to R[x]$. 

The **formal derivative** $\partial_x:R[x] \to R[x]$ is inductively defined by 

* identities $\mathrm{ConstToZero}(r):\partial_x (h(r)) = 0$ for all $r:R$
* identity $\mathrm{IndetToOne}:\partial_x (x) = h(1)$
* identities $\mathrm{linearity}(p, q):\partial_x (p + q) = \partial_x (p) + \partial_x (q)$ for all $p:R[x]$ and $q:R[x]$. 
* identities $\mathrm{LeibnizRule}(p, q):\partial_x (p \cdot q) = \partial_x (p) \cdot q + p \cdot \partial_x (q)$ for all $p:R[x]$ and $q:R[x]$. 

Suppose that $R$ has [[decidable equality]]. Given a non-zero polynomial $p:R[x]$, the **degree** of $p$ is the minimum [[natural number]] $n$ such that the $(n + 1)$-th iteration of the formal [[derivative]] of $p$ is equal to zero: $\partial_x^{n + 1}(p) = 0$. The degree of the zero polynomial is undefined. 

### Polynomials in a finite number of indeterminants

Given a [[commutative ring]] $R$ and a natural number $n$, and a [[finite set]] $X \simeq \mathrm{Fin}(n)$ with $n$ elements, the commutative ring of [[polynomials]] $R[X]$ is a [[higher inductive type]] generated by a type $R[X]$, a function $i:\mathrm{Fin}(n) \to R[X]$, [[identity]] constructors which make $R[X]$ into a commutative ring, and a [[ring homomorphism]] $h:R \to R[X]$. 

The **formal partial derivative** $\partial:X \to (R[X] \to R[X])$ is inductively defined by 

* identities $\mathrm{ConstToZero}(x, r):\partial(x)(h(r)) = 0$ for all $x:X$ and $r:R$
* identities $\mathrm{IndetToOne}(x):\partial(x)(i(x)) = h(1)$ for all $x:X$
* identities $\mathrm{linearity}(x, p, q):\partial(x)(p + q) = \partial(x)(p) + \partial(x)(q)$ for all $x:X$, $p:R[X]$ and $q:R[X]$. 
* identities $\mathrm{LeibnizRule}(p, q):\partial(x)(p \cdot q) = \partial(x)(p) \cdot q + p \cdot \partial(x)(q)$ for all $x:X$, $p:R[X]$ and $q:R[X]$. 

Let $X^*$ be the [[free monoid]] on $X$, and let $f:X^* \to ((R[X] \to R[X]) \to (R[X] \to R[X]))$ be a function which takes a list of indeterminants $a:X^*$ to the composition of formal partial derivatives $\partial(a_1) \circ \partial(a_2) \circ \partial(a_3) \circ \ldots$.

### Homogeneous polynomials

...

An **homogeneous polynomial** of degree $n$ can be defined as a polynomial $p$ such that $\partial_x (p).x = n.p$ (see the [[homogeneous polynomial|Euler identity]]).
