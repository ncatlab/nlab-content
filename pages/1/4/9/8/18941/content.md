## Idea

A 2-[[cell]] in a [[cell complex]] or [[simplicial complex]] etc., such as a [[polyhedron]], is often called a _face_ (also _facet_ or _plaquette_, for instance in [[lattice gauge theory]]).

More generally one calls cells in the [[boundary]] of a [[cell complex]] faces, even if they are higher dimensional (for instance in the definition of [[simplices]] and [[simplicial sets]]).
