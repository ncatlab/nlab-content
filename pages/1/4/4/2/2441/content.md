The **Grassmann algebra** on a [[vector space]] is the [[free object|free]] [[supercommutative algebra]] on $V$ regarded as an odd [[super vector space]].   In other words, it is the quotient of the [[tensor algebra]] $T V$ by the [[ideal]] generated by elements of the form $v \otimes w + w \otimes v$.

In mathematics, the Grassmann algebra is often called the **[[exterior algebra]]** and denoted $\Lambda V$.  The product in this algebra is denoted with a wedge, and called the **wedge product**.  In particular, if $v, w \in V$, we have

$$v \wedge w = - w \wedge v . $$
