## Idea 

An _Artin stack_ is a [[geometric stack]] over the [[Ã©tale site]]: the [[stack]] quotient of a [[scheme]] whose [[automorphism group]]s are [[algebraic group]]s.

This is the general notion of [[algebraic stack]]. But often the latter term is used in a more restrictive sense to mean [[Deligne-Mumford stack]].

For the Grothendieck ring of higher Artin stacks, see Toen: Anneaux de Grothendieck etc, file Toen web prepr K-champ.pdf. For special Artin stacks, he shows by comparing this ring to the ordinary Grothendieck ring of varieties, that invariants such as Hodge numbers and Euler characteristics (l-adic and motivic) extend uniquely to special Artin stacks. In particular, get Lefschetz trace formula for such stacks.
