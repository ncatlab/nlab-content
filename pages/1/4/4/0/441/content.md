Set $\Delta[n] = \mathbf{\Delta}( -, [n]) \in  sS$, then, for each $i$, $0 \leq i \leq n$, we can form, within $\Delta[n] $, a subsimplicial set, $\Lambda^i[n]$, called the **$(n,i)$-horn** or **$(n,i)$-box**,
 by discarding the top dimensional $n$-simplex (given by the
identity map on $[n]$) and its $i^{th}$ face.  We must also discard all the
degeneracies of those simplices.
