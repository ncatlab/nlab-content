Horns are a feature of [[simplicial set]]s.

Set $\Delta[n] = \mathbf{\Delta}( -, [n]) \in  sS$, then, or each $i$, $0 \leq i \leq n$, we can form, within $\Delta[n] $, a subsimplicial set, $\Lambda^i[n]$, called the **$(n,i)$-horn** or **$(n,i)$-box**, by discarding the top dimensional $n$-simplex (given by the identity map on $[n]$) and its $i^{th}$ face.  We must also discard all the degeneracies of those simplices.

A [[Kan complex]] is a simplicial set in which all horns are filled; a [[quasi-category]] is a simplicial set in which all _inner_ horns (those with $0 \lt i \lt n$) are filled. These serve as definitions of weak $\infty$-[[infinity-groupoid|groupoids]] and $(\infty,1)$-[[(infinity,1)-category|categories]].
