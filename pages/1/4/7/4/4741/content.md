## Idea

In the definition of [[(n,r)-categories]] in [[higher category theory]] the **coherence laws** assert that:

###### Semi-formal Definition
**(Coherence)** 

While [[associativity]] and [[uniticity]] of [[composition]] of [[k-morphism]]s holds only up to choices of higher morphisms, **coherence** is the demand that the collection of these choices forms a _[[contractible]]_ [[∞-groupoid]].

A **[[coherence theorem]]** is an assertion that with a given definition of [[n-category]]-structure, coherence is satisfied.

###### Remark

It is the fact that this condition makes recourse among all [[(n,r)-categories]] to [[(∞,0)-categories]]  = [[∞-groupoid]]s that it is easier to define and handle an [[(∞,n)-category|(∞,r)-category]] than an [[(n,r)-category]] for finite $n$: in the former case one just needs that certain spaces are [[contractible]] without necessarily being _equal_ to the point, while in the latter case one demands some of these to be exactly _equal_ to the point, which is a condition much harder to get under control. Accordingly, a _coherence law_ in an [[(n,n)-category]] such as a [[bicategory]] ($n = 2$) or a [[tricategory]] ($n=3$) or a [[tetracategory]] ($n = 4$) is in degree $n+1$ a complicated _equation_ that asserts that a certain contractible space of higher morphisms is exactly equal to the point.

## Examples

* The [[coherence theorem for monoidal categories]] asserts that the with the standar definition of [[monoidal category]], there is a unique composite of [[associators]] that re-bracket any sequence of [[tensor product]]s.
