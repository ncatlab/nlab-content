A *base of enrichment* is some kind of categorical structure $V$ – most often a [[monoidal category]], but potentially something more general like a [[bicategory]], [[virtual double category]], or [[skew-monoidal category]] – over which one intends to do $V$-[[enriched category]] theory. See [[enriched category]] for more. 

Frequently, but not always, $V$ will be a [[Benabou cosmos]], so that one has enough infrastructure available to carry out enriched versions of categorical constructions that one would like, for example [[functor categories]], [[tensor products of enriched categories]], [[presheaf categories]], [[Eilenberg-Moore categories]], and so on. 

"Change of base" or "change of base of enrichment", in this context, refers to a [[2-functor]] $V$-$Cat \to W$-$Cat$ that is induced by a lax morphism $V \to W$ of monoidal categories or of bicategories, etc. This is also described at [[enriched category]].
