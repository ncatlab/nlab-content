A *base of enrichment* is a [[monoidal category]] $V$ over which one intends to do $V$-[[enriched category]] theory. It can also mean a bicategory (or something similar) in which enrichment takes place. See [[enriched category]] for more. 

Frequently, but not always, $V$ will be a [[Benabou cosmos]], so that one has enough infrastructure available to carry out enriched versions of categorical constructions that one would like, for example [[functor categories]], [[tensor products of enriched categories]], various sorts of [[weighted limits]] and [[weighted colimits]], and so on. 

"Change of base" or "change of base of enrichment", in this context, refers to a 2-functor $V$-$Cat \to W$-$Cat$ that is induced by a lax morphism $V \to W$ of monoidal categories or of bicategories, etc. This is also described at [[enriched category]].
