## Idea

In the [[ADE-classification]], the items labeled $D_4$ include the following:

1. as [[Dynkin diagram]]/[[Dynkin quiver]]:

   (graphics grabbed from Wikipedia [here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/Dynkin_diagram_D4.png))

1. as [[finite subgroups of SO(3)]]:

   the [[Klein four-group]]  (the smallest [[dihedral group]])

   $\mathbb{Z}/2 \times \mathbb{Z}/2$

1. as [[finite subgroups of SU(2)]]:

   the [[quaternion group]] of [[order of a group|order]] 8 (the smallest [[binary dihedral group]]):

   $Q_8 \simeq 2 D_4$ 

1. as [[simple Lie groups]]: the [[special orthogonal group]] in 8 dimensions

   [[SO(8)]]


## Properties

### Triality

The [[symmetric group|S3]]-[[symmetry group]] of the D4-diagram translates into interesting 3-fold symmetries of structures associated with the corresponding objects in the above list. This is known as _[[triality]]_.
