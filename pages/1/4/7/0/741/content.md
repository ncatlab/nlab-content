## Definition

A **finite group** is a [[group]] whose underlying [[set]] is [[finite set|finite]].

This is equivalently a [[group object]] in [[FinSet]].

## Classification

The structure of finite groups is a very hard problem; the classification of finite [[simple group]]s alone is one of the largest theorems ever proved (certainly if measured by number of journal pages needed for a complete proof).  

All finite groups are built out of [[simple group]]s, but the ways to do this have not (yet?) been fully classified.

For more on this see

* [[classification of finite simple groups]].

## Examples

* For every [[natural number]] $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the group
  
  $$
    \mathbb{Z}_n := \mathbb{Z}/n \mathbb{Z}
  $$

  which is the quotient of the additive group of [[integer]]s by its action on itself my multiplication with multiples of $n$ is a finite group.

* The largest finite group that is also a [[simple group]] is the [[Monster group]].
