## Definition

An [[endofunctor]] $S:\mathcal{A}\to \mathcal{A}$ is called **pointed** if it is equipped with a [[natural transformation]] $\sigma:Id_\mathcal{A} \to S$.  It is called **well-pointed** if $S\sigma = \sigma S$ (as natural transformations $S\to S^2$).

## Properties

Well-pointed endofunctors have a particularly well-behaved free algebra sequence; see [[transfinite construction of free algebras]].
