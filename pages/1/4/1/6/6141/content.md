A __unitary representation__ of a [[locally compact topological group]] $G$ on a [[Hilbert space]] $H$ is a representation of $G$ as an abstract group on $H$ by [[unitary linear operators]], i.e. the homomorphism of groups $\rho : G\to U(H)\subset End H$ which is continuous with respect to the topology on $U(H)$ [[induced topology|induced]] by the [[strong operator topology]] on $End H$. In other words, $\rho: G\to U(H)$ is a map satisfying $\rho(g h) = \rho(g)\rho(h)$, $\rho(g)^{-1} = \rho(g^{-1}) = \rho(g)^*$ for all $g,h\in G$ and for all $x\in H$, the function $g\mapsto \rho(g)(x)$ on $G$ is norm continuous.
