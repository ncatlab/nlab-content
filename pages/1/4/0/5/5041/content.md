This establishes a statement (theorem 5.3) that characterizes [[∞-stack]]s (over an [[(∞,1)-site]] of formal duals of [[E-infinity-ring|E-∞ algebra]]s over a [[field]]) such that

1. they have a contractible underlying [[∞-groupoid]]

   $$
    \Gamma X \simeq *
   $$

   (in the terminology and notation for [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]]es) 

1. and respect [[(∞,1)-limit|(∞,1)-pullback]]s

with those associated to an [[∞-Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ in the sense of 

* [[Vladimir Hinich]], _DG coalgebras as formal stacks_ ([arXiv:math/9812034](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/9812034))

The construction is then generalized to noncommutative geometry.
