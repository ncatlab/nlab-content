## Idea

This text establishes a statement (theorem 5.3) that characterizes [[∞-stacks]] over an [[(∞,1)-site]] of formal duals of [[Artin ring|Artin]] [[E-infinity-ring|E-∞ algebras]] over a [[field]] (hence [[infinitesimally thickened points]] in [[derived geometry]]) such that

1. they have a contractible underlying [[∞-groupoid]]

   $$
    \Gamma X \simeq *
   $$

   (in the terminology and notation for [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]]es) 

1. and are [[cohesive (∞,1)-presheaf on E-∞ rings|infinitesimally cohesive]] in that they respects [[homotopy fiber products]] of morphisms whose [[kernels]] are [[nilpotent ideals]]

with those associated to an [[∞-Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ in the sense of ([Hinich](#Hinich)). This is ([Lurie, theorem 0.0.13, remark 0.0.15](#Lurie)).



The construction is then generalized to noncommutative geometry.
