An __abelian category__ is an [[additive category]] such that every morphism has a kernel and a cokernel and every morphism uniquely up to a unique isomorphism decomposes into a composition of an epimorphism followed by monomorphism. 

Equivalently, it is a category enriched over the category of abelian groups, with a null object, binary biproducts, kernels, cokernels and such that a 
$$
\mathrm{coker}(\mathrm{ker}\,f) = \mathrm{ker}(\mathrm{coker} f),
$$
where the inner [[kernel]] ([[cokernel]]) is understood as the universal arrow and external as its vertex object, and the equality is given by a canonical isomorphism from the cokernel object of the kernel arrow to the kernel object of the cokernel arrow. 

If an abstract category $C$ has zero object, binary products and binary coproducts, kernels, cokernels and the property that every monic is a kernel arrow and every epi is a cokernel arrow, then it can be equipped with addition on the morphism sets such that the composition is biadditive bifunctor and $C$ is abelian with respect to this structure.
