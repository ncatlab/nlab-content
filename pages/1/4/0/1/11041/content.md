## Idea

In [[quantum physics]] and in particular in the context of [[quantum computing]] a [[linear map]] between spaces of [[linear operators]] (hence an "operator on operators") is sometimes called a _superoperator_.

Notably [[density matrices]] representing [[quantum states]] are given by linear operators and a [[quantum operation]] is a superoperator that preserves the defining properties of density matrices. (Beware that sometimes different or no distinctions between "[[quantum operation]]" and "superoperator" are made.)
