## Idea

A _coring spectrum_ is a [[comonoid object]] in the [[symmetric monoidal (infinity,1)-category of spectra]].
The concept of a _coring spectrum_  is to that of a  _[[ring spectrum]]_ like a [[coalgebra]] is to an [[associative algebra]].

## Examples

* Every [[infinity-groupoid]] ([[homotopy type]] of a [[topological space]]) is canonically a [[coalgebra object]] in the [[Cartesian monoidal (infinity,1)-category]] [[âˆžGrpd]] ([here](cartesian+monoidal+infinity,1-category#CoalgebraObjects)). Accordingly, since forming [[suspension spectra]] is [[strong monoidal functor|strong monoidal]], its suspension spectrum $\Sigma^\infty X_+$ is a coring spectrum.
