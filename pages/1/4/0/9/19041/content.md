## Idea

A **triple category** is an [[n-fold category]] for $n=3$.  That is, it is an [[internal category]] in [[double categories]].  This concept can be considered at various levels of strictness. However, there is not yet a definition in the literature of a fully weak (i.e. pseudo) triple category.

## Examples

* [[strict triple category]]
* [[intercategory]]
* The [[double category of algebras]] can be enhanced to a triple category
* Just as any category gives rise to a double category of [[commutative squares]], any double category gives rise to a triple category of commutative "cubes" by taking the transversal morphisms to be the same as the vertical morphisms.
