## Idea

A **triple category** is an [[n-fold category]] for $n=3$.  That is, it is an [[internal category]] in [[double categories]].  This concept can be considered at various levels of strictness.

## Examples

* [[strict triple category]]
* [[intercategory]]
* The [[double category of algebras]] can be enhanced to a triple category
