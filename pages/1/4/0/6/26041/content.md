# Cauchy completion

The *Cauchy completion* of an object $X$ is a [[universal]] way to make it "Cauchy complete".  There are different (overlapping) meanings of "Cauchy complete", corresponding to different notions of "Cauchy completion":

1. The Cauchy completion of a [[space]] is a [[complete space]].

1. The Cauchy completion of a [[category]] is the [[Karoubi envelope]] of the category.

1. The Cauchy completion of an [[enriched category]] is a [[Cauchy complete category]].

1. The Cauchy completion of an [[(infinity,1)-category]] is an [[idempotent complete (infinity,1)-category]].
