## Idea

__Elementary mathematics__ is a conventional term used in the mathematics education denoting the part of mathematics curriculum which does not require advanced, nonstandard or conceptually deep level of background (in particular, no infinitesimal calculus). 

Though most good approaches to elementary mathematics include setting up basic foundational issues at the appropriate level (for example the principles of proofs etc.), elementary mathematics should be distinguished from the foundations of mathematics. 

#### Terminological remark

In another, related but more narrow sense, in 20-th century education, high school and university mathematics was often divided into "elementary" and "higher" mathematics where elementary the part developed without usage of infinitesimal calculus. Higher mathematics in this obsolete sense denoted calculus and related subjects, but still not any research level, nonstandard or recent mathematics.

### Educational theory on elementary mathematics

* wikipedia: [modern elementary mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_elementary_mathematics)

> Modern elementary mathematics is the theory and practice of teaching elementary mathematics according to contemporary research and thinking about learning. This can include pedagogical ideas, mathematics education research frameworks, and curricular material.

### General references on elementary mathematics

The following is a classics (vol. I in German 1908).

The following overview of elementary mathematics is written by a Lebesgue's student Lucienne F&#233;lix (1901-1994) in French, a well known name in mathematics education (cf. &lt;http://guy-brousseau.com/lucienne-felix>); there are German and Russian translations but no English translation. The introduction says that many of the pedagogical ideas of Lebesgue are incorporated into the text.

Soviet mathematicains (A. D. Aleksandrov, complex analyst Markushevich and Hinchin) wrote in 1950s an ambitious 5-volume work "Encyclopaedia of elementary mathematics" (basic calculus included; geometry is volumes 4 and 5, redacted by Yaglom and Boltianskii):

### Basic calculus adapted to physicists and engineers

Infinitesimal calculus is usually not listed as elementary mathematics. In US educational system infinitesimal calculus at rigorous and advanced level is usually
called mathematical analysis while at the beginner's level it is called simply
calculus. The textbooks are very numerous and widely available and will not be listed here; they witnessed many trends and reforms like calculator-intensive courses and so on. As these textbooks are usually rich in accompanying techniques like teacher manuals, problem sets, solution sets etc. their authors are usually professional mathematicians most often those dedicated to teaching, rather than leading research mathematians. 

A different project of a beginner calculus textbook written by a leading physicist together with a leading geometer came from former Soviet Union

Some argue that calculus is more intuitive for engineers if taught in the [[nonstandard analysis]] approach. One of the major such textbooks is free online

### Foundations of mathematics and categories

Foundations of mathematics is a subject, which is beyond the very basics, NOT belonging to elementary mathematics, nor this entry. However, some readers of this page may find beneficial that we list just a very short choice of standard books on foundations for the first reading (but not that elementary).

* [[Practical Foundations of Mathematics]] 
* Elliott Mendelson, _Introduction to mathematical logic_

The following book is a unique attempt by two prominent mathematicians to give an elementary introduction to [[category theory]] directed at beginning students and general readers which is relevant to school education as well:

* [[F. William Lawvere]], [[Stephen H. Schanuel]], _Conceptual mathematics: a first introduction to categories_ , Cambridge UP 1997.

One should note that the category theory is not traditionally considered a part of elementary mathematics even if some parts can be explained in an elementary way (the same is true for the simplest parts of infinitesimal calculus).
