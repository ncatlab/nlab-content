
__Gottfried Leibniz__ (1646-1716) is responsible for a great many constructions and concepts of current interest:

*  [[differential calculus]] and [[integral calculus]], especially the basic notation that we use today;
*  the [[product rule]] of calculus may be called the _Leibniz rule_ or _Leibniz law_;
*  [[differentiation under the integral sign]] follows the _Leibniz integral rule_;
*  [[identity of indiscernibles]] may be called the _Leibniz law_;
*  a version of [[infinitesimals]] sometimes regarded as a precursor to [[synthetic differential geometry]];

*  a philosophy involving 'monads', simple mind-like substances, from which we get the names of both the [[monads]] of category theory and the [[infinitesimal neighbourhoods]] of [[nonstandard analysis]], see at _[[monad in nonstandard analysis]]_

## Metaphysics

> An instructive starting point distinction made in the contemporary literature ... is between three 'levels of reality' in Leibniz's mature metaphysics. At the most basic level, what is real for Leibniz are simple substances which alone have true unity. These are the famously obscure monads. Next, we have the 'phenomenal level' that is made up of _phenomena bene funda_ – well founded phenomena – that, due to pre-established harmony, are accurate reflections of the real and actual monadic states. Finally, we have the ideal level which, by contrast, is made up of _entia rationis_ – abstract or fictional things – that include 'phenomena' founded upon possible but non-actual monadic states. Crucially, although both the phenomenal and the ideal levels can include things which are infinite, all concepts that depending upon the continuum are only applicable to the ideal realm. Thus, if we were to define time as the real line, $\mathbb{R}$, then this concept of time could only be represented for Leibniz as an entia rationis and thus ideal. Furthermore, phenomenal things for Leibniz can only acquire their status as phenomena bene funda by their grounding upon the actual. They must always be understood as representations or perceptions of the monads of the actual world. ([Thébault 19, p. 2](#Thebault))
