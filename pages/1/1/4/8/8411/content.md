__Gottfried Leibniz__ is responsible for lots of stuff:

*  [[differential calculus]] and [[integral calculus]], especially the basic notation that we use today;
*  the [[product rule]] of calculus may be called the _Leibniz rule_ or _Leibniz law_;
*  [[differentiation under the integral sign]] follows the _Leibniz integral rule_;
*  [[identity of indiscernibles]] may be called the _Leibniz law_;
*  a version of [[infinitesimals]] sometimes regarded as a precursor to [[synthetic differential geometry]];

*  a philosophy involving 'monads', simple mind-like substances, from which we get the names of both the [[monads]] of category theory and the [[infinitesimal neighbourhoods]] of [[nonstandard analysis]], see at _[[monad in nonstandard analysis]]_

   also see in [[Hegel]], _[[Science of Logic]]_ the section _[The monad of Leibniz](Science+of+Logic#TheMonadOfLeibniz)_
