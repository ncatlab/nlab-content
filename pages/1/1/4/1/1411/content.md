Given an operation $*\colon X \times Y \to Y$, an element $e$ of $X$ is called a __left identity__ for $*$ if $e * a = a$ for every element $a$ of $Y$.  That is, the map $Y \to Y$ given by $e * -$ is the [[identity function]] on $Y$.

If $*\colon Y \times X \to Y$, then there is a similar concept of __right identity__.

If $*\colon X \times X \to X$, then $e$ is a __two-sided identity__, or simply __identity__, if it is both a left and right identity.

Historically, identity elements (as above) came first, then [[identity functions]], and then [[identity morphisms]].  These are all the same basic idea, however: an identity morphism is an identity element for the operation of [[composition]].
