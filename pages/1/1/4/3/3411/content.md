Recall that a [[function]] $f\colon X \to Y$ between [[topological spaces]] is __[[continuous map]]__ if the [[preimage]] of every [[open subspace|open set]] in $Y$ is open in $X$.  Such a function is __open__ if the [[image]] of every open set in $X$ is open in $Y$.  Typically one restricts attention to open continous maps, although it also makes sense to speak of open functions that are not continuous.

A continuous map $f\colon X \to Y$ of topological spaces defines a homomorphism $f^*\colon Op(Y) \to Op(X)$ between the [[frames]] of open sets of $X$ and $Y$.  If $f$ is open, then this frame homomorphism is also a [[Heyting algebra]] homomorphism; the converse holds for [[sober spaces]] (maybe as long as $Y$ is $T_0$?).  Accordingly, we define a map $f\colon X \to Y$ of [[locales]] to be __open__ if it is, as a frame homomorphism $f^*\colon Op(Y) \to Op(X)$, a Heyting algebra homomorphism.

[[categorification|Categorifying]], a [[geometric morphism]] $f\colon X \to Y$ of [[toposes]] is __open__ if its [[inverse image functor]] $f^*\colon Y \to X$ is a [[Heyting functor]].
