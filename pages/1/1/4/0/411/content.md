* [[Toby Bartels|Toby]] (2008-12-31): I have a precise definition of [[evil]], so I put that in.

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]] (Dec 31): started [[FQFT]], currently just a commented list of literature trying to give an impression of the idea. Also adjusted [[quantum field theory]] and created [[vertex operator algebra]].

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]] (Dec 30): started entries on [[groupoidification]] and [[quantum field theory]].

* [[John Baez|John]] (Dec 29): I'm going to make a little entry about the term [[evil]].

* [[Toby Bartels|Toby]] (Dec 28): I added a bunch of stuff about [[apartness relation|apartness relations]]. (Most of it is probably even correct.) I tried to say as much as I could in terms of enriched category theory, but the topic is really analysis.

* [[John Baez|John]] (Dec 23): I expanded the entry on [[action groupoid]] and started one for [[action]] and [[automorphism]].  In the process I noted that Urs seems to be using $Sets$ for the category of sets, while most mathematicians use [[Set]].  We should settle (pardon the pun) this issue.  I hope that someday there will be lots of entries on specific important categories, listing some of the special features of these categories.

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]] (Dec 23): continued completing "lits of related entries" in the main entries linked to from the [[HomePage]]: did [[Lie theory]] and [[differential geometry]]

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]] (Dec 23): started creating [[nonabelian algebraic topology]] and [[crossed complex]] and expanded a bit related entries linked to from there. Am hoping we can eventually present more details here.

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]] (Dec 22): started replying to a question [[Eric Forgy|Eric]] raised at [[General Discussion]] about the shape of cells used in higher categories. Created [[geometric shapes for higher structures]] with a discussion of the general idea and linked to [[globular set]], [[simplicial set]] and [[cubical set]] from there. Still plenty of room to add details. Am planning to give details on the monoidal structure on cubical sets and the induced Crans-Gray tensor product on $\omega$-[[omega-category|categories]].

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]] (Dec 20): I started to add alphabetical lists of all related entries to the big headline entries that are linked to from the sidebar
of the [[HomePage]]. So far I did this in [[category theory]], [[sheaf and topos theory]], [[foundations]] and [[higher category theory]]. It might be good if each time we create a new entry we think about adding the correspondin link to one of these general lists.

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]] (Dec 20): I replied to the discussion at [[monoidal category]] on "Where does all this structure and  coherence come from?" by adding a subsection on how all this comes from the general concept of $\infty$-[[lax functor]] for which one formalization can be given in terms of [[oriental]]s and Street's [[descent and codescent|descent]]. The pentagon identity is precisely the fourth [[oriental]]! 

* [[Toby Bartels|Toby]] (Dec 20&#8211;23): I won\'t do anything, since I\'ll be travelling. (Just in case you wonder where I am.) 

  * [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: Thanks for the info, Toby. Myself, I will probably be online sporadically over the holidays.

* [[John Baez|John]] (Dec 20): I sketched the definitions of [[monoidal category]], [[braided monoidal category]], and [[symmetric monoidal category]] and gave links to full definitions and explanations.  Is someone good enough at drawing diagrams in this environment to draw the necessary diagrams --- e.g. pentagon and hexagon identity?  

* [[Toby Bartels|Toby]] (Dec 20): More on [[Grothendieck topos]] and [[well-pointed topos]], including definitions that are correct in constructive mathematics.

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: recently, after [[Eric Forgy|Eric]] had requested an "arrow-theoretic" description of [[category algebra]] and of [[graded vector space]]s, I had provided a description in terms of [[bi-brane]]s and remarked that this is part of a bigger picture. That bigger picture, together with these examples, is now described over in my private area at [[schreiber:Nonabelian cocycles and their quantum symmetries]]. For completeness I have added links to that to [[category algebra]] and [[graded vector space]]. Instead of giving the impression of forcing this relation to my work upon these entries, I would like you to understand this as an invitation to check and, if necessary, criticize. 

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: I tried to flesh out [[tensor product]] and [[module]] a bit further, providing more details and attempting to bring the different points of view together. Check.

* [[Toby Bartels]]: I just expanded [[tensor product]], enough to include the example that links to it (without circularity).

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: I expanded on the entry [[action groupoid]] that [[Eric Forgy|Eric]] started.
