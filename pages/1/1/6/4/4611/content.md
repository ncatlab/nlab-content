## Definition

A [[category]] $D$ is called __sifted__ if [[colimits]] of [[diagrams]] of shape $D$ (called [[sifted colimits]]) commute with finite [[products]] in [[Set]].

Of course, $D$ is called **cosifted** if $D^{op}$ is sifted.

## Properties

Gabriel and Ulmer proved that an [[inhabited set|inhabited]] category is sifted if and only if the [[diagonal functor|diagonal]] $D \to D\times D$ is a [[final functor]].  More explicitly, this means that for every pair of objects $d_1,d_2\in D$, the category $Cospan_D(d_1,d_2)$ of [[cospans]] from $d_1$ to $d_2$ is [[connected category|connected]].

Note that this condition holds in particular if $D$ has finite [[coproducts]], since then it is nonempty (it has an [[initial object]]) and each category of cospans has an initial object (the coproduct).
