## Overview

A **code loop** is a certain sort of [[Moufang loop]] constructed as a central extension of certain vector spaces over the [[finite field]] $\mathbb{F}_2$. In particular, such vector spaces are taken to be doubly even [[binary code]]s.

A general result about the existence of code loops is as follows.

###### Theorem
([Griess](#Griess)).
Every doubly even binary code has a unique extension by a non-associative Moufang loop.

This can be seen as a result about the cohomology used to define code loops, namely that it is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}/2$ (one always has the trivial extension, which is just a group).

Code loops were originally defined independently by Robert Griess and Richard Parker. A modern description is in ([Hsu](#Hsu)).

Parker's code loop was used by [[John Conway]] to construct the [[Monster group]], and arises from taking the binary code to be the [[binary Golay code]].
