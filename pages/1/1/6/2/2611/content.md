The additive envelope of an [[Ab-enriched category]] $A$ is defined by taking the objects as formal direct sums of objects in $A$, and morphisms as matrices of coefficients, giving an [[additive category]].  This is a universal construction.

For instance, a [[semisimple category]] is the additive envelope of its full subcategory consisting of simple objects.  Also, any additive category is equivalent to its own additive envelope.

By further taking the [[Karoubi envelope]] (i.e. formally adding images of idempotent elements), one constructs a [[Karoubian category]] called the pseudo-abelian envelope of $A$.  In general, the pseudo-abelian envelope of $A$ is not abelian.  

The combination of additive envelope and Karoubi envelope gives the [[Cauchy completion]] in the case of [[Ab-enriched categories]].
