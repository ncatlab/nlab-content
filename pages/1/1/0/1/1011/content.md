A **finite category** $C$ is a [[category]] [[internal category|internal to]] the category [[FinSet]] of finite sets.

This means that a finite category consists of
* a finite set of [[object]]s;
* a finite set of [[morphism]]s.

(Notice that the latter implies the former, since for every object there is the [[identity]] morphism on that object).

Similarly, a **locally finite category** is a category [[enriched category|enriched]] over $Fin Set$, that is a category whose [[hom-set]]s are all finite.

(Locally) finite categories may also be called (locally) **$\omega$-small**; this generalises from $\omega$ (the set of [[natural number]]s) to (other) [[inaccessible cardinal]]s (or, equivalently, [[Grothendieck universe]]s).

# Limits and colimits

One is often interested in whether an arbitrary category $D$ has [[limit]]s and [[colimit]]s indexed by finite categories.  A category with all finite limits is called **[[finitely complete category|finitely complete]]** or **left exact** (or **lex** for short).  A category with all finite colimits is called **finitely cocomplete** or **right exact**.
