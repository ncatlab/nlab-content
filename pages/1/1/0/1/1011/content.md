A **finite category** $C$ is a [[category]] [[internal category|internal to]] the category [[FinSet]] of finite sets.

This means that a finite category consists of

* a finite set of [[object]]s;

* a finite set of[[morphism]]s.

(Notice that the latter implies the former, since for every object there is the [[identity]] morphism on that object).
