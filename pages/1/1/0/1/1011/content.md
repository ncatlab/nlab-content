A **finite category** $C$ is a [[category]] [[internal category|internal to]] the category [[FinSet]] of finite sets.

This means that a finite category consists of
* a finite set of [[object]]s;
* a finite set of [[morphism]]s.

(Notice that the latter implies the former, since for every object there is the [[identity morphism]] on that object).

Similarly, a **locally finite category** is a category [[enriched category|enriched]] over $Fin Set$, that is a category whose [[hom-set]]s are all finite.

(Locally) finite categories may also be called (locally) **$\omega$-small**; this generalises from $\omega$ (the set of [[natural number]]s) to (other) [[inaccessible cardinal]]s (or, equivalently, [[Grothendieck universe]]s).

# Limits and colimits

One is often interested in whether an arbitrary category $D$ has [[limit]]s and [[colimit]]s indexed by finite categories.  A category with all finite limits is called **[[finitely complete category|finitely complete]]** or **left exact** (or **lex** for short).  A category with all finite colimits is called **finitely cocomplete** or **right exact**.

# Discussion #

[[Eric]]: Is the following statement correct?

>For any finite category $C$, there is a [[directed graph]] $G$ such that its [[quiver]] $Q(G)$ is equivalent to $C$.

[[Mike Shulman]]: No, this is false.  The "walking commutative square"
$$\array{ & \to & \\
  \downarrow && \downarrow\\
  & \to & }$$
is a finite category which is not free on any directed graph.

_Toby_:  The walking commutative triangle is an even simpler counterexample.  Rather, we should say that any finite category is a *[[quotient object|quotient]]* of some quiver; the nontrivial commutation relations (triangles, squares, etc) give us this quotient.  But in fact, there is nothing special about finite categories here; every category is a quotient of the quiver on its underlying graph.  So I think that the only point to be made here is that, for a finite category, the graph may also be taken to be finite, but even that is obvious since the underlying graph is finite.

[[Eric]]: Thanks! That is interesting. This reminds me of the [[ericforgy:differential envelope|universal differential envelope]] on a complete directed graph. Any discrete calculus is a quotient of the universal discrete calculus obtained by removing some edges.

_Toby_:  Sure, there are lots of [[adjunctions]] that work this way.  (I forget the precise adjective that I should put before 'adjunction' here.)

[[Mike Shulman]]: If the "walking commutative triangle" means what I think it does, then it actually is a quiver.  The hypotenuse is freely generated as the composite of the other two sides.

[[Eric]]: Wait a second. Does the "walking commutative square" consist of 4 objects? If so, then the diagonal should be a morphism because it is the composite of two sides so the diagram is not complete as drawn. It should include the diagonal. I'm sure I'm confused. What am I missing?

[[Mike Shulman]]: Yes, the diagonal is a morphism.  I didn't draw it because we don't usually draw the diagonal when we draw a commutative square, just like we don't usually draw identity morphisms.

[[Eric]]: Ok. I thought the missing diagonal was the barrier to being "free". What is the barrier then? If you start with a directed graph as you drew without the diagonal then the corresponding quiver contains the diagonal as it should. There must be something else I'm missing. Thanks. 

[[Urs Schreiber]]: apart from looking at the counterexample that Mike gave, it shoud be useful to say in words in full generality what is going on:

>In a _free_ category on a directed graph composition of morphisms is always just a concatenation operation. Nothing really happens when you compose any two morphisms. 

So another good counterexample to think of is a [[delooping]] category $\mathbf{B}A$ of a [[monoid]] $A$ or $\mathbf{B}G$ of a [[group]] $G$: in as far as the product operation in $A$ and $G$ actually does something instead of just saying that $a \cdot b$ is $a b$, the corresponding category is not a free category.

[[Eric]]: I'm still confused. What is it about these counterexamples that make them counterexamples? For example, if $G$ is finite, then there is a finite number of elements $g_1,g_2,\dots$ that generate all of $G$. We can construct a graph with one node and directed edge for each generator. Wouldn't the resulting quiver be equivalent to $\mathbf{B}G$?

[[Mike Shulman]]: The point is that in the free category on the directed graph
$$\array{ & \to & \\
  \downarrow && \downarrow\\
  & \to & }$$
there are *two* diagonals, one being generated by the top-right composite and the other by the bottom-left composite.  If you included the diagonal itself as a generator in the directed graph, then there would be *three* diagonals.

[[Eric]]: Thanks Mike. That is very helpful. So given JUST a square graph, it's quiver will have TWO diagonals. So we need more information. We need to specify something like a "curvature" that tells you how paths having the same start and end points fail to commute. When that curvature is zero, the paths commute. 

If we label the directed edges $T$,$B$,$L$,$R$, then when we construct the composites (to form the quiver) we end up with two diagonal morphisms $RT$ and $BL$. We need a 2-morphism $F:RT\to BL$. To specify a rule for this 2-morphism, we probably need a 2-edge. In the absence of specifying a directed 2-edges, we _could_ assume the curvature is flat. What this means is that we _could_ have a concept of a "free $n$-category" generated by a directed $n$-graph. If there are no edges above $n$, then it means all closed $(n-1)$-paths commute.

This is a slightly different definition of a quiver where closed paths are assumed to commute. If you want a close $(n-1)$-path to NOT commute, you need to specify a corresponding $n$-edge connecting the two paths.

In other words, I think I'm suggested that we have free categories generated by a directed graph _default_ to having all closed paths commute. If you want a closed path NOT to commute, you need to specify a 2-edge and form a 2-quiver. Does that make any sense?

Here are some pictures. Let's say we start with a 2-graph square and form a "2-quiver" as illustrated below:

[[2-quiver.jpg:pic]]

The 2-edge $F$ tells us that the composites $RT$ and $BL$ are not the same.

If we fail to include a 2-edge and start with the 1-graph and form its 1-quiver as illustrated below:

[[1-quiver.jpg:pic]]

then it is as if we HAD included a 2-edge, but it is a trivial 2-edge and its corresponding 2-morphism is simply a 2-identity and the two composites commute.

I _think_ that any finite category can be obtained in this way not via a finite 1-quiver (in which all closed 1-paths commute) but rather by a 2-quiver. If there is any sense to this, it seems to me to indicate that maybe a category with non-commuting paths is secretly a non-trivial 2-category somehow. 

_Todd_: More examples of finite categories which are not quivers: take the group $\mathbb{Z}_2$ as a 1-object category. Or the category with two objects and exactly one morphism in each hom-set. 

As far as your suggestion goes, I'm inclined to say you seem to have it backwards from how I'd go about it. There is a notion of something called "computad" which all this reminds me of, which come in various dimensional flavors. A 2-computad consists of a directed graph and a collection of "2-cells" or 2-edges whose source and target are directed paths in the directed graph (= morphisms in the free category on the directed graph). In my way of thinking, a 2-cell would provide something like a membrane or bridge or a homotopy which would allow you to _identify_ paths (the source and target of the 2-cell) up to homotopy, instead of distinguishing them as you are doing. So, for any 2-computad, there would be something like its "fundamental category" (like a fundamental groupoid, but with directed paths considered modulo 2-cells), and you could say that any finite category is the fundamental category of some finite 2-computad. (But lots of different 2-computads would have the same fundamental category.) 

There is also the notion of free 2-category generated from a 2-computad, and this is the beginning of an induction ladder. 

[[Mike Shulman]]: Yeah, I'm with Todd; it seems strange to me to try to specify which diagrams *don't* commute instead of which ones *do*.

I'm not sure if this is quite what you were thinking of with "a category with non-commuting paths [i.e. a category that isn't a preorder] is secretly a non-trivial 2-category somehow", but it's not true that you can make a 2-category out of a category by putting a 2-cell between any two unequal parallel arrows.  For one, there would be no identity 2-cells (since an arrow *is* equal to itself), and for two, you can't compose inequalities; if $f\neq g$ and $g\neq h$ it can still be that $f=h$.

[[David Roberts]]: I like the idea about the fundamental category of a 2-computad - I have some examples of things up my sleeve that I think this (and the next level up - the fundamental bicategory of a 3-computad) would very accurately describe. One of which is the localisation of a (small) category. Even more interesting for me would be the comparison with [[directed homotopy]], especially if the 2-cells are not invertible.

[[Eric]]: Thank you Todd and Mike! This is all very neat. That sounds interesting too David. I was also thinking about directed homotopy. I'm sure you guys are right and it is more natural to specify which diagrams commute rather than which diagrams don't commute, but my motivation was curvature. If there is no curvature, then parallel transporting a particle along either path doesn't matter. However, if there is curvature, then a particle will end up "rotated" depending on which path you take. In this analogy, it is the "absence" of curvature that makes the paths commute. It seemed natural that specifying a non-identity 2-edge was like specifying a non-zero curvature.

I like the idea of computads. I thought about that as well (although I didn't know they were called computads), but I think you really can get away with just directed $n$-graphs. Instead of a single directed edge as I drew in the picture which is more like a morphism between paths of length 2, we could have two 2-edges:

$$F_1: L\to T\quad\text{and}\quad F_2:B\to R.$$

Then

$$F:BL\to RT$$

is some kind of horizontal composition. Anyway, whether it is computads or directed graphs or specifying which edges commute or which edge don't commute, I'm pretty excited. I'm much more comfortable thinking about directed graphs, so the more I can use them to help understand other concepts, the better for me. If finite categories can be reduced to some smaller atomic graph, that would be kind of neat.

[[Mike Shulman]]: I'm not sure what you mean by a 2-graph, but if you mean the obvious thing, then you can't have an edge $L\to T$ in one since $L$ and $T$ aren't parallel.

By the way, I think the "fundamental category" of a computad is just going to be the reflection of its free 2-category into 1-categories (forcing all 2-cells to become identities).  It's certainly true that any finite category can be presented in this way by a finite computad, although not every category presented by a finite computad is finite (for instance, the monoid of natural numbers regarded as a 1-object category is presented by the computad with one object, one endo-1-cell, and no 2-cells).

[[Eric]]: Hi Mike. Here is the page on [[directed n-graph]]s. A directed 2-edge simply has a source 1-edge and a target 1-edge. These do not have to be parallel. If there is some problem with that, we should change the page. Any inaccuracies there are my fault :)

[[Todd Trimble]]: The notion of directed 2-graph as given there does seem weird to me. The problem is that if we think of a 2-cell as some kind of "shape" with boundary, then according to standard practice we should have something like "boundary of the boundary is zero". In the computad setting, there are globularity conditions that say "source of the source = source of the target, and target of the source = target of the target" which give the boundary of boundary conditions. 

Ultimately we would want some sort of geometric realization of these critters, and it's hard to see how that would go precisely with the current [[directed n-graph]].
