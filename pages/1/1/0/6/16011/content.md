## Idea

The term _heteromorphism_ ([Ellerman 2006](#Ellerman06), [Ellerman 2007](#Ellerman07)) refers to concept of a [[morphism]] not (necessarily) between two [[objects]] in the same [[category]], but between objects in two different categories that are related by a [[functor]], and typically by an [[adjoint functor]], in which case the notion is first made explicit in [Pareigis 1970, ยง2.2](#Pareigis70). Indeed, sets of heteromorphism may be used to characterize [[adjoint functors]]. Generally, the set of heteromorphisms is that assigned by the corresponding [[profunctor]] to the pair of objects.

The concept is also known as the *[[cograph of a functor]]*. While in traditional [[category theory]] literature this is maybe somewhat neglected, it serves for instance as the very definition of [[adjoint (infinity,1)-functors|adjoint $(\infty,1)$-functor]] in the context of [[quasi-categories]] in [Lurie 2009](#Lurie09)) (without using the term "heteromorphism" there).


## Definition

Given two [[categories]] $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ and a [[functor]] $L \colon \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$, then for $c\in \mathcal{C}$ and $d \in \mathcal{D}$ two [[objects]], the set of _heteromorphisms_ between them is the [[hom set]]

$$
  Het(c,d) \coloneqq \mathcal{D}\big(L(c),d\big)
  \,.
$$

When $L$ has a [[right adjoint]] $R \colon \mathcal{D}\to \mathcal{C}$ then this is of course equivalent to 

$$
  Het(c,d) \cong \mathcal{C}\big(c,R(d)\big)
  \,.
$$

More generally, for $Het \colon \mathcal{C}^{op}\times \mathcal{D}\to Set$ a [[profunctor]] from $\mathcal{C}$ to $\mathcal{D}$, then $Het(c,d)$ may be called its set of heteromorphisms from $c$ to $d$.

A pair of [[adjoint functors]] arise when a Het profunctor is a [[representable functor]] on both the left and right. The [[left adjoint]] is representing functor on the left:
$$
  \mathcal{D}\big(L(c),d\big) \cong  Het(c,d)
  \,
$$
and symmetrically the [[right adjoint]] is the representing functor on the right:
$$
  Het(c,d) \cong \mathcal{C}\big(c,R(d)\big)
  \,.
$$

Putting the two representations together gives the usual natural isomorphism characterization of a [[adjunction]] but with the het middle term:
$$
\mathcal{D}\big(L(c),d\big) \cong  Het(c,d) \cong \mathcal{C}\big(c,R(d)\big)
\,.
$$

### Characterization of adjunctions

Heteromorphisms may be used to express/characterize [[adjunctions]]. For more on this see at
