## Idea

While in general, [[fields]] are non-[[trivial rings]], it is sometimes useful in [[commutative algebra]] for the [[trivial ring]] to be a regarded as a field. Thus, the idea of a **possibly trivial field**. 

## Definition

Let $R$ be a [[commutative ring]] and let $D \subseteq R$ be the [[subset]] of all non-[[invertible elements]] in $D$. A **possibly trivial field** is a [[commutative ring]] $R$ such that every [[element]] in the [[two-sided ideal]] $I_D$ generated by $D$ is equal to zero, or that the quotient ring $R/I_D$ is isomorphic to $R$. 

If $R$ is the [[trivial ring]], $D$ is the [[empty subset]], the ideal generated by the [[empty set|empty]] subset is the trivial ideal $0R$, and $R/0R$ is always [[isomorphic]] to $R$. 

## Constructing a possibly trivial field from a commutative ring

From every commutative ring, one could construct a possibly trivial field. 

As above, let $R$ be a [[commutative ring]], let $D \subseteq R$ be the subset of non-[[invertible elements]] in $D$, and let $I_D$ be the [[two-sided ideal]] generated by $D$. The quotient of $R$ by $I_D$ is the possibly trivial field of $R$. 

$R/I_D$ is a possibly trivial field, because the quotient of $R$ by $I_D$ takes all elements of $I_D$ to zero. If $R$ is a [[local ring]], then $R/I_D$ is an [[field]]; otherwise, $R/I_D$ is the [[trivial ring]]. 

## In constructive mathematics

In constructive mathematics, the notion of field bifurcates into multiple notions. The definition given above results in a possibly trivial [[Johnstone residue field|residue field]] in the sense of [Johnstone77](#Johnstone77). However, there are also possibly trivial [[Heyting fields]] and possibly trivial [[discrete fields]]. 

### Possibly trivial Heyting fields

A possibly trivial field $R$ is **Heyting** if, whenever the sum of two elements $a + b$ is invertible, then either $a$ is invertible or $b$ is invertible. These are simply called *Heyting fields* in [LombardiQuitté2010](#LombardiQuitté2010). 

### Possibly trivial discrete fields

A possibly trivial field is **discrete** if every element is either zero or invertible. These are simply called *discrete fields* in [LombardiQuitté2010](#LombardiQuitté2010). Possibly trivial discrete fields have [[decidable equality]].
