## Idea

While in general, [[fields]] are non-[[trivial rings]], it is sometimes useful in [[commutative algebra]] for the [[trivial ring]] to be a regarded as a field. Thus, the idea of a **possibly trivial field**. 

## Definition

Let $R$ be a [[commutative ring]], let $\mathrm{Reg}(R)$ be the [[monoid of regular elements]] in $R$, let $\neg \mathrm{Reg}(R)$ be the [[complement]] of $\mathrm{Reg}(R)$, the set of [[zero divisors]] in $R$, and let $I_{\neg \mathrm{Reg}(R)}$ be the [[two-sided ideal]] generated by $\neg \mathrm{Reg}(R)$. 

A **possibly trivial field** is a [[commutative ring]] $R$ such that 

* every [[element]] in $\mathrm{Reg}(R)$ is a [[unit]], or that the [[localization of a commutative ring|localization]] $R[\mathrm{Reg}(R)^{-1}]$ is isomorphic to $R$. 

* every [[element]] in $I_{\neg \mathrm{Reg}(R)}$ is equal to zero, or that the [[quotient ring]] $R/I_{\neg \mathrm{Reg}(R)}$ is isomorphic to $R$. 

If $R$ is the [[trivial ring]], $\neg \mathrm{Reg}(R)$ is the [[empty subset]], the ideal generated by the [[empty set|empty]] subset is the trivial ideal $0R$, and $R/0R$ is always [[isomorphic]] to $R$. 

Alternatively, one can define possibly trivial fields using a weakened version of [[negation]] from [Lombardi & Quitté 2010](#LombardiQuitté2010) in the definition of an field: 

\begin{definition}
A **possibly trivial field** is a [[commutative ring]] $R$ such that for all elements $x \in R$, if $x$ being a [[invertible element]] implies that $0 = 1$, then $x = 0$. 
\end{definition}

## Constructing a possibly trivial field from a commutative ring

Let $R$ be a [[commutative ring]], let $\mathrm{Reg}(R)$ be the [[monoid of regular elements]] in $R$, let $\neg \mathrm{Reg}(R)$ be the [[complement]] of $\mathrm{Reg}(R)$, the set of [[zero divisors]] in $R$, and let $I_{\neg \mathrm{Reg}(R)}$ be the [[two-sided ideal]] generated by $\neg \mathrm{Reg}(R)$. 

There are two operations one could do to a commutative ring $R$, taking the quotient by $I_{\neg \mathrm{Reg}(R)}$, and localizing at $\mathrm{Reg}(R)$. Taking the quotient by $I_{\neg \mathrm{Reg}(R)}$ results in a [[possibly trivial integral domain]] $R/I_{\neg \mathrm{Reg}(R)}$, while localizing at $\mathrm{Reg}(R)$ results in a [[prefield ring]], the [[ring of fractions]] $R[\mathrm{Reg}(R)^{-1}]$. The operations are commutative: first taking the quotient by $I_{\neg \mathrm{Reg}(R)}$ then localizing at $\mathrm{Reg}(R)$ and first localizing at $\mathrm{Reg}(R)$ then taking the quotient by $I_{\neg \mathrm{Reg}(R)}$ results in isomorphic possibly trivial fields, because no element is both a zero divisor and regular. 

Thus, one has a [[functor]] $L:\mathrm{CRing} \to \mathrm{Prefield}$ which takes a commutative ring to its [[ring of fractions]], and a functor $Q:\mathrm{CRing} \to \mathrm{PTIntDom}$ taking a commutative ring to its quotient possibly trivial integral domain, and because the category of prefield rings and the category of possibly trivial integral domains are subcategories of the category of commutative rings, there are also [[subfunctors]] $L':\mathrm{PTIntDom} \to \mathrm{PTField}$ and $Q':\mathrm{Prefield} \to \mathrm{PTField}$ where $L' \subseteq L$ and $Q' \subseteq Q$. The functors form a [[commutative square]] with [[natural isomorphism]] $p:L' \circ Q \cong Q' \circ L$:

$$\array{& \mathrm{CRing} & \overset{L}\rightarrow & \mathrm{Prefield} & \\
          Q & \downarrow & \cong &\downarrow & Q'\\
          & \mathrm{PTIntDom} & \underset{L'}\rightarrow& \mathrm{PTField} & \\
}$$

## In constructive mathematics

In constructive mathematics, the notion of field bifurcates into multiple notions. The definition given above results in a possibly trivial [[weak Heyting field]]. However, there are also possibly trivial [[Heyting fields]] and possibly trivial [[discrete fields]]. 

### Possibly trivial Heyting fields

A possibly trivial field $R$ is **Heyting** if, whenever the sum of two elements $a + b$ is invertible, then either $a$ is invertible or $b$ is invertible. These are simply called *Heyting fields* in [LombardiQuitté2010](#LombardiQuitté2010). 

### Possibly trivial discrete fields

A possibly trivial field is **discrete** if every element is either zero or invertible. These are simply called *discrete fields* in [LombardiQuitté2010](#LombardiQuitté2010). Possibly trivial discrete fields have [[decidable equality]].
