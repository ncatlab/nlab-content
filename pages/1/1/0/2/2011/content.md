## Idea
 {#Idea}

__Differential topology__ is the subject devoted to the study of [[algebraic topology|algebro]]-[[topology|topological]] and [[homotopy theory|homotopy-theoretic]] properties of [[differentiable manifolds]], [[smooth manifolds]] and related [[differential geometry|differential geometric]] [[spaces]] such as [[stratifolds]], [[orbifolds]] and more generally [[differentiable stacks]]. 

A key part of differential topology is [[cobordism theory]], where the [[Pontryagin theorem|Pontryagin-]][[Pontryagin-Thom theorem|Thom theorem]] relates the [[stable homotopy theory|stable]] [[homotopy theory]] of [[Thom spectra]] to [[cobordism classes]] of [[smooth manifold|smooth]] ([[submanifold|sub]]-)[[smooth manifold|manifolds]] (for instance [[cohomotopy]] to [[normal framing|normally framed]] [[cobordism]]).
 
Differential topology is also concerned with the problem of finding out which topological (or PL) manifolds allow a  [[smooth structure|differentiable structure]] and the degree of nonuniqueness of that structure if they do (e.g. [[exotic smooth structures]]). It is also concerned with concrete constructions of [[cohomology|(co)]][[homology]] classes (e.g. [[characteristic class]]es) for differentiable manifolds and of [[differential cohomology|differential refinements of cohomology theories]]. 

More recently, the *[[smooth Oka principle]]* reveals a deep structure in differential topology which is visible in the full generality of [[higher differential geometry]] ([[smooth infinity-groupoid|smooth $\infty$-stacks]]).

## Examples

Many considerations, and classification problems, depend crucially on [[dimension]], and the case of high-dimensional manifolds (the notion of 'high' depends on the problem) is often very different from the situation in each of the low dimensions; thus there are specialists' subjects like $3$-(dimensional) topology and $4$-topology. There are restrictions on an underlying topology which is allowed for some sorts of additional structures on a differentiable manifold. 


For example, only some even-dimensional differentiable manifolds allow for [[symplectic manifold|symplectic structure]] and only some odd-dimensional one allow for a [[contact manifold|contact structure]]; in these cases moreover special constructions of topological invariants like [[Floer homology]] and [[symplectic field theory]] exist.

This yields the relatively young subjects of symplectic and contact topologies, with the first significant results coming from Gromov. Any (Hausdorff paracompact finite-dimensional) differentiable manifold allows for [[Riemannian manifold|riemannian structure]] however; therefore there is no special subject of 'riemannian topology'.

## References

Though some of the basic results, methods and conjectures of differential topology go back to [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]], [[Hassler Whitney|Whitney]], [[Anthony P. Morse|Morse]] and [[Lev Pontrjagin|Pontrjagin]], it became an independent field only in the late 1950s and early 1960s with the seminal works of [[Stephen Smale|Smale]], [[René Thom|Thom]], [[John Milnor|Milnor]] and [[Morris Hirsch|Hirsch]]. Soon after the initial effort on foundations, mainly in the American school, a strong activity started in Soviet Union ([[Albert Schwarz]], [[Alexandr S. Mishchenko|A. S. Mishchenko]], [[Sergei Novikov|S. Novikov]], [[Vladimir Abramovich Rokhlin|V. A. Rokhlin]], [[Mikhail Gromov|M. Gromov]],...).
