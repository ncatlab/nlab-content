## Idea
 {#Idea}

__Differential topology__ is the subject devoted to the study of [[algebraic topology|algebro]]-[[topology|topological]] and [[homotopy theory|homotopy-theoretic]] properties of [[differentiable manifolds]], [[smooth manifolds]] and related [[differential geometry|differential geometric]] [[spaces]] such as [[stratifolds]], [[orbifolds]] and more generally [[differentiable stacks]]. 

A key part of differential topology is [[cobordism theory]], where the [[Pontryagin theorem|Pontryagin-]][[Pontryagin-Thom theorem|Thom theorem]] relates the [[stable homotopy theory|stable]] [[homotopy theory]] of [[Thom spectra]] to [[cobordism classes]] of [[smooth manifold|smooth]] ([[submanifold|sub]]-)[[smooth manifold|manifolds]] (for instance [[cohomotopy]] to [[normal framing|normally framed]] [[cobordism]]).
 
Differential topology is also concerned with the problem of finding out which topological (or PL) manifolds allow a  [[smooth structure|differentiable structure]] and the degree of nonuniqueness of that structure if they do (e.g. [[exotic smooth structures]]). It is also concerned with concrete constructions of [[cohomology|(co)]][[homology]] classes (e.g. [[characteristic class]]es) for differentiable manifolds and of [[differential cohomology|differential refinements of cohomology theories]]. 

More recently, the *[[smooth Oka principle]]* reveals a deep structure in differential topology which is visible in the full generality of [[higher differential geometry]] ([[smooth infinity-groupoid|smooth $\infty$-stacks]]).

## Examples

Many considerations, and classification problems, depend crucially on [[dimension]], and the case of high-dimensional manifolds (the notion of 'high' depends on the problem) is often very different from the situation in each of the low dimensions; thus there are specialists' subjects like $3$-(dimensional) topology and $4$-topology. There are restrictions on an underlying topology which is allowed for some sorts of additional structures on a differentiable manifold. 


For example, only some even-dimensional differentiable manifolds allow for [[symplectic manifold|symplectic structure]] and only some odd-dimensional one allow for a [[contact manifold|contact structure]]; in these cases moreover special constructions of topological invariants like [[Floer homology]] and [[symplectic field theory]] exist.

This yields the relatively young subjects of symplectic and contact topologies, with the first significant results coming from Gromov. Any (Hausdorff paracompact finite-dimensional) differentiable manifold allows for [[Riemannian manifold|riemannian structure]] however; therefore there is no special subject of 'riemannian topology'.

## References

Though some of the basic results, methods and conjectures of differential topology go back to [Poincar&#233;](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9), Whitney, Morse and Pontrjagin, it became an independent field only in the late 1950s and early 1960s with the seminal works of Smale, Thom, Milnor and Hirsch. Soon after the initial effort on foundations, mainly in the American school, a strong activity started in Soviet Union (Albert Schwarz, A. S. Mishchenko, S. Novikov, V. A. Rokhlin, M. Gromov...).
