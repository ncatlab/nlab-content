__Differential topology__ is the subject devoted to the study of topological properties of [[differentiable manifold]]s and closely related spaces like [[stratifold]]s, [[orbifold]]s and more general [[differentiable stacks]]. It is also concerned with the problem of finding out which topological (or PL) manifolds allow a differentiable structure and the degree of nonuniqueness of that structure if they do. It is also concerned with concrete constructions of (co)homology classes (e.g. characteristic classes) for differentiable manifolds and of [[differential cohomology|differential refinements of cohomology theories]]. 

Many considerations, and classification problems, depend crucially with dimension, and the case of high dimensional manifolds (the notion of 'high' depends on the problem) is often very different from the situation in each of the low dimensions; thus there are specialists' subjects like 3-(dimensional) topology and 4-topology. There are restrictions on an underlying topology which is allowed for some sorts of additional structureson a differentiable manifold. For example, only some even-dimensional differentiable manifolds allow for symplectic structure and only some odd-dimensional allow for a contact structure; in these case moreover special constructions of topological invariants liek Floer homology and symplectic field theory exist.
This yields relatively young subjects of symplectic and contact topologies, with first significant results coming from Gromov. Any (Hausdorff paracompact finite-dimensional) differentiable manifold allows for riemannian structure however; therefore there is no special subject of 'riemannian topology'.

Though some of the basic results, methods and conjectures of differential topology go back to [Poincar&#233;](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9), Whitney, Morse and Pontrjagin, it became an independent field only in late 1950-s and early 1960-s with seminal works of Smale, Thom, Milnor and Hirsch.
