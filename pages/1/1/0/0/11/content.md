## Articles

* _Rethinking set theory_, e-print [arXiv:1212.6543 [math.LO]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1212.6543), 2012; see also [discussion on nCafé](https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2012/12/rethinking_set_theory.html)

  This is an expository article for a general mathematical readership. It describes [[ETCS]], but without assuming any knowledge of category theory or ever defining a category.

* _A survey of definitions of n-category_, e-print [math.CT/0107188](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.CT/0107188),
2001; also [Theory and Applications of Categories 10 (2002), no. 1, 1&#8211;70.](http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/10/1/10-01abs.html)

* _An informal introduction to topos theory_, Publications of the nLab vol. 1 no. **_1_** (2011).

  At https://ncatlab.org/publications/published/Leinster2011 , but as of 2022 the live version is not entirely readable: the diagrams and some other typesetting are broken.

  A [readable version](https://web.archive.org/web/20131212071554/http://ncatlab.org:80/publications/published/Leinster2011) (give the scripts a few seconds to load after opening the page) can be found in the Internet Archive.


## Books

* _[Basic Category Theory](http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~tl/bct/)_, 2014

  Short description from author's web page for book:

  > Basic Category Theory is an introductory category theory textbook. Features:
  >
  > * It doesn't assume much, either in terms of background or mathematical maturity.
  >
  > * It sticks to the basics.
  >
  > * It's short.
  >
  > Advanced topics are omitted, leaving more space for careful explanations of the core concepts. I have used versions of this text to teach final-year undergraduate and master's-level courses at the Universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh.
