Seems like catamorphism and [hylomorphism](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/hylomorphism) are not around. Thanks so much for the amazing wiki!

##Â Idea

Given an [[endofunctor]] $F$, the catamorphism for an $F$-[[algebra for an endofunctor|algebra]] $A$ is the [[homomorphism]] from the [[initial algebra for an endofunctor|initial $F$-algebra]] (if existent) to $A$.
