## In philosophy

In [[philosophy]] a concept called _substance_ plays the central role in [[Spinoza's system]]. In [[Hegel]]'s _[[Science of Logic]]_ this is claimed to be recovered from a more  fundamental "process" as "the final unity of essence and being" ([&#167;1235](Science%20of%20Logic#1235)).
