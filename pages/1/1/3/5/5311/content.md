## Definitions

A _[[square root]]_ of a number $a$ is a solution to the equation $x^2 -a = 0$. This is denoted $\pm \sqrt{a}$.

More generally, for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ a solution to the equation $x^n - a = 0$ is called an **$n$th root** of $a$. Specifically for $a = 1$ and working in the [[field]] of [[complex number]]s one speaks of an **$n$th root of unity**.

More generally, for any [[polynomial]] or more general [[function]] $P(x)$ of $x$, a solution to $P(x) = 0$ is called a _root_ (or _zero_) of $P$.
