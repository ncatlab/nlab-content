The category of elements is a 0-categorical version of Grothendieck construction, due to MacLane. Given a functor $P:C^{\mathrm{op}}\to\mathbf{Set}$ (presheaf of sets) one defines a category $\int_C P$ called the category of elements of $P$. Objects of $\int_C P$ are pairs $(c,x)$ where $c$ is an object in $C$ and $x$ is an element in $P(c)$ and morphisms $(c,x)\to(c',x')$ are morphisms $u:c\to c'$ such that $P(u)(x') = x$. The category of elements comes equipped with a 'projection' functor $\pi_P:\int_C P \to C$ given by $(c,x)\mapsto c$ and $u\mapsto u$; this projection should be viewed also as a $C$-indexed family.
