## Idea

The _category of elements_ of a [[functor]] $F : C \to $ [[Set]] is a [[category]] $el(F) \to C$ sitting over the [[domain]] [[category]] $C$, such that the [[fiber]] over an [[object]] $c \in C$ is the set $F(c)$. 

This is a special case of the [[Grothendieck construction]], by considering sets as discrete categories.

We may think of [[Set]] as the [[classifying space]] of "[[Set]]-bundles;" see [[generalized universal bundle]].  The category of elements of $F$ is, in this sense, the [[Set]]-bundle classified by $F$.  It comes equipped with a projection to $C$ which is a [[Grothendieck fibration|discrete fibration]], and provides an equivalence between presheaves and discrete fibrations.

Forming a category of elements can be thought of as "unpacking" a [[concrete category]]. For example, consider a concrete category $C$ consisting of two objects $X,Y$ and two non-trivial morphisms $f,g$

The individual elements of $X,Y$ are "unpacked" and become objects of the new category. The "unpacked" morphisms are inherited in the obvious way from morphisms of $C$.

Note that an "unpacked" category of elements can be "repackaged".

The generalization of the category of elements for functors landing in [[Cat]], rather than just $Set$, is called the [[Grothendieck construction]].


## Definition

Given a functor $P:C\to\mathbf{Set}$, the **category of elements** $el(P)$ or $El_P(C)$ (or obvious variations) may be understood in any of these equivalent ways:

* It is the [[category]] whose objects are pairs $(c,x)$ where $c$ is an object in $C$ and $x$ is an element in $P(c)$ and morphisms $(c,x)\to(c',x')$ are morphisms $u:c\to c'$ such that $P(u)(x) = x'$.

* It is the [[pullback]] along $P$ of the [[generalized universal bundle|universal Set-bundle]] $U : Set_* \to Set$

  $$
    \array{ 
       El_P(C) &\to& Set_* 
       \\ 
       \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\pi_P}} && 
       \downarrow^\mathrlap{U} 
       \\ 
       C &\to& Set
     }\,,
   $$
 
   where $U$ is the [[forgetful functor]] from [[pointed set|pointed sets]] to sets.

* It is the [[comma category]] $(*/P)$, where $*$ is the inclusion of the one-point set $*:*\to Set$ and $P:C\to Set$ is itself:

  $$
    \array{ 
       El_P(C) &\to& * 
       \\ 
       \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\pi_P}} &\Downarrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{pt}} 
       \\ 
       C &\to& Set
    }
   $$

* Its [[opposite category|opposite]] is the [[comma category]] $(Y/P)$, where $Y$ is the [[Yoneda embedding]] $C^{op}\to [C,Set]$ and $P$ is the functor $*\to [C,Set]$ which picks out $P$ itself:

  $$
    \array{ 
       El_P(C)^{op} &\overset{\pi_P^{op}}{\to}& C^{op} 
       \\ 
       \downarrow &\Downarrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{Y}} 
       \\ 
       * & \underset{P}{\to}& [C,Set]
    }
  $$

  $El_P(C)$ is also often written with [[end|coend]] notation as $\int^C P$, $\int^{c: C} P(c)$, or $\int^c P(c)$.  This suggests the fact the set of objects of the category of elements is the [[disjoint union]] (sum) of all of the sets $P(c)$.

* It is the (strict) [[oplax colimit]] of the composite $C \xrightarrow{P} \mathbf{Set} \xrightarrow{disc} \mathbf{Cat}$; see [[Grothendieck construction]].

When $C$ is a [[concrete category]] and the functor $F:C\to Set$ is simply the [[forgetful functor]], we can define a functor

$$Explode(-) := El_F(-).$$

This is intended to illustrate the concept that constructing a category of elements is like "unpacking" or "exploding" a category into its elements.

## Properties

The category of elements defines a functor $el : \mathbf{Set}^{C} \to \mathbf{Cat}$.  This is perhaps most obvious when viewing it as an oplax colimit.  Furthermore we have:

+-- {: .num_theorem #ColimitPreserving}
###### Theorem
The functor $el : \mathbf{Set}^{C} \to \mathbf{Cat}$ is [[cocontinuous functor|cocontinuous]].
=--
+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
As remarked above, $el$ is a strict [[weighted colimit]] [[2-colimit]], hence we have an isomorphism
$$ el(P) \cong \int^{c\in C} J(c) \times disc(P(c)) $$
where the weight $J:C^{op} \to \mathbf{Cat}$ is the functor $c\mapsto c/C$, and $disc:\mathbf{Set}\hookrightarrow \mathbf{Cat}$ is the inclusion of the [[discrete categories]].  But since $disc$ (regarded purely as a 1-functor) has a right adjoint (the functor which sends a -small- category $C$ into its set of elements $C_0$), it preserves (1-categorical) colimits.  Since colimits also commute with colimits, the composite operation $\el$ also preserves colimits.

+-- {: .num_theorem #ColimitPreserving2}
###### Theorem
The functor $el\colon \mathbf{Set}^{C} \to \mathbf{Cat}$ has a right adjoint (which is maybe a more direct way to see that it is cocontinuous).
=--
+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
By a simple coend computation
$$
\begin{array}{rl}
\mathbf{Cat}(el(F),D)&\cong \mathbf{Cat}\Big(  \int^c J c\times\delta(P  c), D\Big)\\ &\cong \int_c\mathbf{Cat}\big(J c\times \delta(F c),D\big)\\ 
&\cong \int_c \mathbf Sets\big(F c,[J c,D]_0\big)\\ 
&\cong \mathbf{Set}^{C}(F, K(D))
\end{array}
$$
where $K(D)\colon c\mapsto [J c,D]_0$.

Now for any $C$, the terminal object of $\mathbf{Set}^C$ is the functor $\Delta 1$ constant at the [[point]].  The category of elements of $\Delta 1$ is easily seen to be just $C$ itself, so the unique transformation $P\to \Delta 1$ induces a _projection functor_ $\pi_P: \el(P) \to C$ defined by $(c,x)\mapsto c$ and $u\mapsto u$.  The projection functor is a [[discrete opfibration]], and can be viewed also as a $C$-indexed [[family of sets]].  When we regard $\el(P)$ as equipped with $\pi_P$, we have an embedding of $\mathbf{Set}^C$ into $\mathbf{Cat}/C$.

Note that while the canonical projection $\operatorname{El}(F) \to \mathbf{C}$ is surjective on objects, it is not usually [[full functor|full]]. For example, let $\mathbf{B}\mathbb{N}$ be the one-object category which carries the monoid $(\mathbb{N}, +)$ as its endomorphism monoid, and let $F$ be the action of $(\mathbb{N}, +)$ on the set $\mathbb{N}$ by $n.m = m + n$. Then the image of any hom-set between $k, k'$ is a singleton subset of $\mathbb{N}$.

More generally, the [[universal covering groupoid]] of a groupoid is just the category of elements of its action on itself by composition. Since this action is faithful and transitive,  hom-sets in the category of elements are always $0$ or $1$, while objects in the groupoid might have nontrivial automorphism groups.

##Examples

### Representable Presheaves

Let $Y(C):\mathcal{C}^{op}\to Set$ be a representable presheaf with $Y(C)(D)=Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(D,C)$. Consider the contravariant category of elements $\int_\mathcal{C} Y(C)$ . This has objects $(D_1,p_1)$ with $p_1\in Y(C)(D_1)$, hence $p_1$ is just an arrow $D_1\to C$ in $\mathcal{C}$. A map from $(D_1, p_1)$ to $(D_2, p_2)$ is just a map $u:D_1\to D_2$ such that $p_2\circ u =p_1$ but this is just a morphism from $p_1$ to $p_2$ in $\mathcal{C}/C$. Accordingly we see that $\int_\mathcal{C} Y(C)\simeq \mathcal{C}/C$ .


### Action Groupoid

In the case that $C = \mathbf{B}G$ is the [[delooping]] [[groupoid]] of a [[group]] $G$, a functor $\varrho : \mathbf{B}G \to Set$ is a [[permutation representation]] $X$ of $G$ and its category of elements is the corresponding [[action groupoid]] $X/\!/G$.
+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
This is easily seen in terms of the characterization $el(\varrho)\cong (*/\varrho)$, the category having as objects triples $(*,*; *\to \varrho(*)=X)$, namely elements of the set $X=\varrho(*)$, and as arrows $x\to y$ those $g\in \mathbf{B}G$ such that
$$
\array{
{*} & \overset{x}{\to}  & X  \\
{}^1\downarrow && \downarrow^g\\
{*} & \underset{y}{\to} & X
}
$$
commutes, namely $g . x=\varrho(g)(x)=y$. We can also present the right adjoint to $el(-)$: one must consider the functor $J\colon \mathbf{B}G^{op}\to \mathbf{Cat}$, which represents $G$ in $\mathbf{Cat}$, and sends the unique object $*\in \mathbf{B}G$ to $*/\mathbf{B}G\cong G/\!/G$, the _left_ action groupoid of $G$. The functor $J$ sends $h\in G$ to an automorphism of $G/\!/G$, obtained multiplying _on the right_ $x\to g x$ to $x h\to x g h$.

Now for any category $D$, $K( D)(*)$ is exactly the set of functors $[G/\!/G, D]$, which inherits from $G/\!/G$ an obvious action: given $F\in [G/\!/G,  D]$ we define $F^h=J(h)^*F=F \circ J(h) \colon g \mapsto F(g h)$.

### Category of simplices

For a [[simplicial set]] regarded as a [[presheaf]] on the [[simplex category]], the corresponding category of elements is called its _[[category of simplices]]_. See there for more.
