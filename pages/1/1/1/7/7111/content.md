## Idea

__Berkovich analytic spaces__ are a version of [[analytic space]]s over [[nonarchimedean fields]]. Unlike the _rigid analytic spaces_ (see [[rigid analytic geometry]]) of Tate, which are locally defined via [[maximal spectra]] of Tate algebras glued via rigidified Grothendieck topology, the Berkovich analytic spaces are defined with respect to the [[analytic spectrum]], due to [[Vladimir Berkovich]]; this spectrum can be viewed as consisting of the data of prime ideal plus the extension of the norm to the residue field; thus the Berkovich spectrum has far more points (though fewer than, say, [[Huber's adic spaces]] which may also contain valuations of higher order). 

For more background see _[[analytic geometry]]_.

## Definition of Berkovich analytic spaces

Let $k$ be a [[non-archimedean field]].

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Given $n \in \mathbb{N}$  and positive elements $\{r_1, \cdots, r_n \in k\}$, consider the sub-[[power series]] [[associative algebra|algebra]] over $k$ defined by

$$
  \{\frac{1}{r_1} T_1 , \cdots, \frac{1}{r_n}T_n\}
  :=
  \left\{
    \sum_\nu a_\nu T^\nu | \lim_{{\vert \nu\vert} \to 0} {\vert a_\nu \vert} r^\nu = 0
  \right\}
  \,.
$$

This is a commutative [[Banach algebra]] over $k$ with [[norm]] ${\Vert f \Vert} = max {\vert a_\nu\vert} r^\nu$.

A **$k$-[[affinoid algebra]]** is a commutative Banach $k$-algebra $A$ for which there exists $n$ and $\{r_i\}$ as above and an [[epimorphism]]

$$
  \{\frac{1}{r_1} T_1 , \cdots, \frac{1}{r_n}T_n\}
  \to 
  A
$$

such that the norm on $A$ is the quotient norm.

If one can choose here $r_i = 1$ for all $i$ then $A$ is called **strictly $k$-affinoid**.

The [[category]] of **$k$-affinoid spaces** is the [[opposite category]] of the category of $k$-affinoid algebras and bounded [[homomorphisms]] between them.

=--

Via the [[analytic spectrum]] $Spec_{an}$ there is a [[topological space]] associated with any $k$-affinoid space. Often this underlying topological space is referred to as _the analytic space_. 

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

An **affinoid domain** in an affoinoid space $X = Spec_{an} A$ is a [[closed subset]] $V \subset X$ such that there is a [[homomorphism]] of $k$-affinoid spaces 

$$
  \phi : Spec_{an} A_V \to X
$$

for some $A_V$, whose [[image]] is $V$, and such that every other morphism of $k$-affinoid spaces into $X$ whose image is contained in $V$ uniquely factors through this morphism.

=--
 
+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A **$k$-analytic space** is a [[topological space]] 
equipped with an [[atlas]] by affinoid domains.

See [Berkovich 98, paragraph 2](#BerkovichReview).

## Properties

### Cohomology 
 {#Cohomology}

Under some mild conditions, the algebraic and the analytic [[étale cohomology]] of Berkovich spaces agree. ([Berkovich 95](#Berkovich95))

The underlying [[topological space]] $X^{an}$ given by the [[Berkovich analytic spectrum]] has as [[singular cohomology]] the [[weight filtration|weight 0]]-cohomology of $X$ ([Berkovich 09](#Berkovich09)).

See also MO discussion [here](http://mathoverflow.net/a/171653/381).


### Local contractibility
 {#LocalContractibility}

A [[complex analytic manifold]] and a _smooth_ [[complex analytic space]] is locally isomorphic to a [[polydisk]] and hence is trivially a [[locally contractible space]]. But over a [[non-archimedean field]] analytic spaces no longer need to be locally isomorphic to polydisks (but $p$-adic polydisks are still contractible ([Berkovich 90](#Berkovich90))). The following result establishes, under mild conditions, that general analytic spaces are nevertheless locally contractible.



Assume that the [[valuation]] on the ground field $k$ is nontrivial.

+-- {: .num_defn #LocallyEmbeddableInASmoothSpace}
###### Definition

A $k$-analytic space $X$ is called _locally embeddable in a smooth space_ if each point of $X$ has an [[open neighbourhood]] [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to a strictly $k$-analytic domain in smooth $k$-analytic space. 

=--

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

Every $k$-analytic space which is locally embeddable in a smooth space, def. \ref{LocallyEmbeddableInASmoothSpace}, is a [[locally contractible space]].

More precisely, every point of a locally smooth $k$-analytic space has an open neighbourhood $U$ which is contractible, and which is a [[union]] $U = \cup_{i = 1}^\infty U_i$ of analytic domains.

=--

The local contractibility is [Berkovich (1999), theorem 9.1](#BerkovichContractible). The refined statment in terms of inductive systems of analytic domains is in [Berkovich (2004)](#BerkovichContractibleII).

## Examples

* [[analytic affine line]]

## Applications

* The proof of the [[local Langlands conjecture]]
for $GL_n$ by Harris&#8211;Taylor uses [[étale cohomology]] on non-archimedean analytic spaces (in the sense of Berkovich) to construct the required Galois representations over local fields.
