

In [[gauge theory]] a _planar limit_ is a limit in which [[scattering amplitudes]] are dominated by [[Feynman diagrams]] which can be given the structure of [[planar graphs]].
In particular, this phenomenon happens in the [[large N limit]] of [[Yang-Mills theory]], as seen from [['t Hooft double line notation]].

See at [[N=4 D=4 super Yang-Mills theory]] for discussion of the main examples.
