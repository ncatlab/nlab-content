## Idea

The _Eilenberg-Watts theorem_ identifies colimit-preserving [[functors]] between [[categories of modules]] with the operations of forming [[tensor product of modules|tensor products]] with [[bimodules]].

## Statement

### For ordinary rings and modules

+-- {: .num_theorem}
<b>Eilenberg-Watts Theorem</b>

Given unital [[rings]] $R$ and $S$ and an $R$-$S$-[[bimodule]] $N$, the [[tensor product of modules|tensor product]] [[functor]]

$$ 
  (-) \otimes_R N  
   \;\colon\; 
  Mod_R \to Mod_S 
$$

between the [[categories of modules]] is [[additive functor|additive]] and [[cocontinuous functor|cocontinuous]].  Conversely, if $F \colon Mod_R \to Mod_S$ is additive and cocontinuous, then it is naturally isomorphic to tensoring with a bimodule.

=--

This theorem was more or less simultaneously proved in ([Watts](#Watts)) and ([Eilenberg](#Eilenberg)).

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Given an additive cocontinuous functor $F \colon Mod_R \to Mod_S$, the reconstructed $R$-$S$-bimodule is given as follows:

* the underlying right $S$-module is $F(R)$, where $R$ is regarded as a right module over itself in the canonical way;

* the left $R$-module structure on $F(R)$ is given for $r \in R$ and $n \in N$ by

  $$
    r \cdot n \coloneqq F(r\cdot(-))n
    \,,
  $$

  where $r \cdot (-) \colon R \to R$ denotes the right $R$-module homomorphism given by left multiplication by $r$.

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

The theorem holds for nonunital rings as well, but then $B$ reconstructs as $F(R_1)$ where $R_1$ is the extension of $R$ by adjoining the unit element (the tensor product is still over the original $R$). If $F$ is a [[flat functor]] then $F(R_1)$ is a [[flat module]] over $R$. 

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

There are various equivalent ways to state the hypotheses of the theorem:

* $F$ is additive and [[cocontinuous functor|cocontinuous]] (i.e. preserves [[small category|small]]  [[colimits]]).
* $F$ is additive, [[right exact functor|right exact]] and preserves [[small category|small]] [[coproducts]].  
* $F$ is additive and [[left adjoint]].

=--

The theorem is stated in the last form, for instance, in ([Hovey, Theorem 0.1](#Hovey)).

In fact both bimodules and [[intertwiners]] as well as [[functors]] and [[natural transformations]] form a [[category]]. In more detail the theorem is:

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

For $R$ and $S$ two [[rings]], the [[functor]]

$$
  {}_R Mod_{S} \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} Func_{coc}(Mod_R, Mod_S)
$$

from the category of bimodules to that of colimit-preserving additive functors between their [[categories of modules]] is an [[equivalence of categories]].

### For enriched categories

Rings can be seen as one-object $V$-enriched categories where $V = Ab$ is the category of abelian groups made symmetric monoidal with the usual tensor product of abelian groups.   Similarly, bimodules between rings are the same as $V$-enriched [[profunctors]] between one-object $V$-enriched categories.  The category of right modules of a ring $R$ is the category of $V$-enriched presheaves on the corresponding one-object $V$-enriched category. Thus, we can ask if the Eilenberg-Watts theorem generalizes to $V$-enriched categories.  And indeed it does!  

Suppose that $V$ is a [[Benabou cosmos]], i.e. a complete and cocomplete symmetric monoidal closed category.  Then there is a symmetric monoidal bicategory $V Mod$ where:

* objects are small $V$-enriched categories,
* morphisms are $V$-enriched profunctors,
* 2-morphisms are $V$-enriched natural transformations between profunctors.

There is also a symmetric monoidal bicategory $V Cocont$ where:

* objects are the $V$-enriched presheaf categories $[C^{op},V]$ where $C$ ranges over all small $V$-enriched categories,
* morphisms are cocontinuous $V$-functors, i.e. $V$-functors preserving all $V$-enriched colimits,
* 2-morphisms are $V$-enriched natural transformations between cocontinuous $V$-functors.

Then the following is surely true, though a reference would be helpful:

###### Generalized Eilenberg-Watts' Theorem

Given a Benabou cosmos $V$, the symmetric monoidal bicategories $V Prof$ and $V Cocont$ are equivalent.

=--


### For other internal monoids and internal modules

The standard Eilenberg-Watts theorem is a statement about [[monoids]] and their [[actions]] in [[Ab]]. More generally one may ask for generalizations of the theorem to other internalization contexts, and in particular to [[homotopy theory]]. See the introduction of ([Hovey](#Hovey)).

### For $\infty$-algebras and $\infty$-modules
 {#ForInfinityAlgebrasAndInfinityModules}

In particular Eilenberg-Watts theorems hold true in the [[homotopy theory]] following [[model categories]] (see at [[model structure on modules over an algebra over an operad]])

* [[model structure on topological spaces]]

* [[model structure on simplicial sets]]

* [[model structure on chain complexes]]

* [[model structure on spectra]] (symmetric, orthogonal, $\mathbb{S}$-modules).

This is the main theorem in ([Hovey](#Hovey)).

More generally, we have the first half of the Eilenberg-Watts theorem in [[(∞,1)-category theory]]:

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

For $(\mathcal{C}, \otimes)$ a [[monoidal (∞,1)-category]] with [[geometric realization]] of [[simplicial objects in an (∞,1)-category]] such that the [[tensor product]] $\otimes$ preserves this in each variable, then for all [[A-∞ algebra]] $A,B,C$ in $\mathcal{C}$, the tensor product of [[∞-bimodules]] 

$$
  (-) \otimes_B (-) \;\colon\; {}_A Mod_{B} \times {}_B Mod_{C} \to {}_{A} Mod_{C}
$$

preserves [[(∞,1)-colimits]] separately in each argument.
