## Idea

Serre's criterion of affineness characterizes [[affine morphism]]s of schemes in terms of exactness properties of the corresponding functors among the categories of [[quasicoherent sheaves]].

If $f\colon X\to Y$ is a [[quasicompact morphism]] of [[algebraic scheme]]s and $X$ is [[separated scheme|separated]], then $f$ is affine iff it is cohomologically affine, that is, the direct image functor $f_*$ is [[exact functor|exact]]. 

## Statement

__EGA II Theorem 5.2.1__ Let $X$ be a reduced quasicompact scheme or a noetherian scheme. The following conditions are equivalent

a) X is an affine scheme.

b) There is a family of elements $f_\alpha\in\Gamma(X,\mathcal{O}_X)$ such that (the corresponding principal localizations) $X_{f_\alpha}$ are affine and the ideal generated by $f_\alpha$-s in $A$ is $A$.

c) The functor $\Gamma(X,\mathcal{F})$ 
is exact in $\mathcal{F}$ in the category of quasicoherent $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules, in other words,
if 
$$ 0\rightarrow \mathcal{F}'\rightarrow\mathcal{F}\rightarrow\mathcal{F}''\rightarrow 0 \,\,\,\,\,\,\,   (*)
$$
is an exact sequence of quasicoherent $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules, the sequence
$$ 0\rightarrow \Gamma(X,\mathcal{F}')\rightarrow\Gamma(X,\mathcal{F})\rightarrow\Gamma(X,\mathcal{F}'')\rightarrow 0
$$
is exact.

c)' The property c) holds for all exact sequences (*) of quasicoherent $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules such that $\mathcal{F}$ is a sub-$\mathcal{O}_X$-module of a finite product $\mathcal{O}_X^n$.

__EGA II Corollary 5.2.2__ Let $f:X\to Y$ be a quasicompact separated morphism of schemes. The following conditions are equivalent:

a) $f$ is an affine homomorphism.

b) The functor $f_*$ is exact on the category of quasicoherent $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules.

c) For each quasi-coherent $\mathcal{O}_X$-module $\mathcal{F}$, we have $\mathbf{R}^1 f_*(\mathcal{F})=0$.

c') For every quasi-coherent sheaf $\mathcal{I}$ of ideals in $\mathcal{O}_X$, we have $\mathbf{R}^1 f_*(\mathcal{I})=0$.
