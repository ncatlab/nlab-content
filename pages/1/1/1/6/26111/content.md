## Idea

A generalization of [[Cayley's theorem]] to [[inverse semigroup]]s. The same idea, when sets have additional local structure, is responsible for the appearance of [[pseudogroup]]s of symmetries in geometry.

## Statement

Every [[inverse semigroup]] has an injective homomorphism into the inverse semigroup of partial bijections of some set.
