Given a ring $R$ the bifunctor $\otimes_R : Mod_{R}\times _{R}Mod\to Ab$ is right exact. Its left derived functors $Tor(-,B)$ and $Tor(A,-)$ with respect to one argument with fixed another, if they exist, are parts of a bifunctor $Tor : Mod_{R}\times _{R}Mod\to Ab$. If there are sufficiently many [[projective objects]] in both $Mod_{R}$ and $_{R}Mod$, both are equal to balancing $Tor$, which is the bifunctor obtained by taking the homology of total complex of a bicomplex of $Hom$-s in which $A\otimes B$ is resolved by taking a projective resolution in each argument.
