## Idea

The concept of a **division superalgebra** (also **super division algebra**) is the equivalent of a [[division algebra]] in the context of [[superalgebra]]. As such, a division superalgebra is a superalgebra in which every nonzero homogeneous element is [[invertible]].

The classification of the 10 real division superalgebras is consider the basis of the [[ten-fold way]] regarding the topological phases of matter.
