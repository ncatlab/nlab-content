## Idea

The concept of a **division superalgebra** (also **super division algebra**) is the equivalent of a [[division algebra]] in the context of [[superalgebra]]. As such, a division superalgebra is a superalgebra in which every nonzero homogeneous element is [[invertible]].

The classification of the real division superalgebras is given by a "[[ten-fold way]]" famous from the [[K-theory classification of topological phases of matter]].
