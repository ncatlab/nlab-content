**$(\infty,1)Cat$** is the [[(∞,2)-category]] of all small [[(∞,1)-categories]].

Its full [[subcategory]] on [[∞-groupoid]]s is [[∞Grpd]].

## The $(\infty,2)$-category 

### As an $SSet$-category

One incarnation of [[(∞,2)-categories]] is given by [[quasi-category]]-enriched categories (see there for details). As such $(\infty,1)Cat$ is the full [[SSet]]-[[enriched category|enriched]] [[subcategory]] of [[SSet]] on those [[simplicial set]]s that are [[quasi-categories]]. By the fact described at [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-functors]] this is indeed a [[quasi-category]]-enriched category.

### As an enriched model category

The [[model category]] presenting this [[(∞,2)-category]] is the Joyal [[model structure for quasi-categories]] $sSet_{Joyal}$. Its full [[sSet]]-[[subcategory]] is the [[quasi-category]] enriched category of quasi-categories from above.

## The $(\infty,1)$-category

Sometimes it is useful to consider inside the full $(\infty,2)$-catgeory of $(\infty,1)$-categories just the maximal $(\infty,1)$-category and discrading all non-invertible [[k-morphism|2-morphisms]]. This is the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-categories]].

### As an $SSet$-category

As an [[SSet]]-[[enriched category]] the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-categories]] is obtained from the quasi-category-enriched version by picking in each [[hom-object]] simplicial set of $(\infty,1)Cat$ the maximal [[Kan complex]]. 


### As an enriched model category

One [[model category]] structure presenting this is the [[model structure on marked simplicial over-sets|model structure on marked simplicial sets]]. As a plain [[model category]] this is [[Quillen equivalence|Quillen equivalent]] to $sSet_{Joyal}$, but as an [[enriched model category]] it is $sSet_{Quillen}$ enriched, so that its full [[SSet]]-subcategory on fibrant-cofibrant objects presents the $(\infty,1)$-category of $(\infty,1)$-categories.
