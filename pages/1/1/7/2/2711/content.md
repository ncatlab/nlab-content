An **element** of a [[set]] is a thing which "belongs to," or "is an element of," that set.

The circularity of this definition is unavoidable in foundational [[set theories]] in which "set" is an undefined term.  In "definitional" set theories, where "set" is defined in terms of something else, elements are likewise defined in terms of the same "something else."


## Generalisations

*  An [[object]] in a [[category]];
*  a [[morphism]] in a category, a different sort of element from an object;
*  in general, $k$-[[k-morphism|morphisms]] or $k$-cells in an $\infty$-[[infinity-category|category]];
*  a [[generalised element]] of any object in any category or higher category;
*  a [[global element]] of any object in any category or higher category with a [[terminal object]].
