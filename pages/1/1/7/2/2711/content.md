An **element** of a [[set]] is a thing which "belongs to," or "is an element of," that set.

The circularity of this definition is unavoidable in foundational [[set theories]] in which "set" is an undefined term.  In "definitional" set theories, where "set" is defined in terms of something else, elements are likewise defined in terms of the same "something else."
