This is a redirection page using the semi-standard term **D-geometry** for the geometry of [[D-modules]] (and closely related perverse sheaves), D-schemes, differential operators and related structures. As equations of mathematical physics are often given by differential equations and the [[quantization]] depends much on the fine aspects of the [[symplectic geometry]] and D-geometry it may be useful to have some focusing point(s) in $n$lab on our effort to keep notes on this field. For now the material is rather scarce and most of the related entries are stubs:

* [[regular differential operator]], [[ordinary differential equation]]

* [[connection]], [[flat connection]], [[local system]], [[D-module]], [[perverse sheaf]]

* [[holonomic D-module]], [[meromorphic connection]], [[characteristic variety]]

* [[diffiety]], [[Grothendieck connection]], [[crystal]], [[de Rham space]]

* [[synthetic differential geometry]], [[infinitesimal object]]

* [[Kähler differential]], [[tangent category]], [[tangent (∞,1)-category]], [[cotangent complex]], [[deformation theory]], [[formally smooth morphism]], [[jet space]]

* [[semiclassical approximation]], [[Maslov index]], [[Stokes phenomenon]], [[wall crossing]]

* [[microlocal analysis]], [[algebraic microlocalization]]

* [[Riemann-Hilbert problem]]

* [[algebraic approaches to differential calculus]]

* [[regular differential operator in noncommutative geometry]]
