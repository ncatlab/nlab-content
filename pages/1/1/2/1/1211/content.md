A [[well-founded relation]] $\prec$ on a set $S$ is said to be **extensional** if for any $x,y\in S$, if $z\prec x$ if and only if $z\prec y$ for all $z\in S$, then $x=y$.

Well-founded relations are often used to represent [[axiom of foundation|well-founded]] [[pure set]]s.  In this case, where $\prec$ represents the 'membership' relation $\in$, a restriction to extensional such relations corresponds to imposing the axiom of extensionality (two sets are equal if they have the same elements).

For non-well-founded sets, a more complicated definition of extensionality must often be given.  See [[anti-foundation axiom]].
