A [[well-founded relation]] $\prec$ on a set $S$ is said to be **extensional** if for any $x,y\in S$, if $z\prec x$ if and only if $z\prec y$ for all $z\in S$, then $x=y$.

This is a kind of [[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetry]] condition:  Let $x \leq y$ mean that $z \prec y$ whenever $z \prec x$.  Then $\leq$ is clearly a [[preorder]]; it\'s antisymmetric (so a [[partial order]]) if and only if $\prec$ is extensive.

Suppose that (short of extensionality) if $z \prec x$ if and only if $z \prec y$ for all $z$, then $x \prec z$ if and only if $y \prec z$ for all $z$.  If $\sim$ is the [[equivalence relation]] generated by $\leq$, then $\prec$ the [[quotient set]] $S/{\sim}$ has an extensional relation.

Well-founded relations are often used to represent [[axiom of foundation|well-founded]] [[pure set]]s.  In this case, where $\prec$ represents the 'membership' relation $\in$, a restriction to extensional such relations corresponds to imposing the axiom of extensionality (that two sets are equal if they have the same elements).

For non-well-founded sets, a more complicated definition of extensionality must often be given.  See [[anti-foundation axiom]].
