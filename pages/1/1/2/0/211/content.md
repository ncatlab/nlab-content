The **Anonymous Coward** is the default username for editing this wiki. So if somebody edits the wiki without signing in, then their edits will be attributed to the Anonymous Coward.  A few jokers have changed 'AnonymousCoward' to something different but equally anonymous ... which is OK too.

However, people who *really* want to be anonymous should know that every editor\'s IP address is listed at [RecentlyRevised](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/recently_revised).
