## Definition

A [[continuous function|map]] $p$ of [[topological spaces]] is called a __Serre microfibration__
if for any [[lifting problem|lifting square]] for $\{0\}\times K\to [0,1]\times K$ and $p$,
we can find $\epsilon\gt0$ such that the [[lifting property]] is satisfied
after [[restriction|restricting]] to $[0,\epsilon]\times K\subset [0,1]\times K$.

## Properties

Any [[Serre fibration]] is a Serre microfibration.

Any inclusion of [[open subspaces]] is a Serre microfibration.
It is a Serre fibration if and only it is a [[homeomorphism]].
