## Idea

According to [[Hegel]] _[[Science of Logic]]_ ([&#167; 191](Science+of+Logic#191)) _Dasein_ ("determinate being") is the [[Aufhebung]] of [[becoming]], which in turn is the [[unity of opposites]] of [[nothing]] and [[being]].

| |  | [[Dasein]] | |  |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| [[becoming]] : | [[nothing]] | $\;\;\;\dashv$ | [[being]] | : [[ceasing]] |


According to [[Hegel]] _[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]_ ([Vorrede &#167;55](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Phenomenology+of+Spirit#Vorrede55)) this is the _[[Nous]]_ of [[Anaxagoras]].

Following suggestions by [[William Lawvere]] as discussed in detail at _[Aufhebung --  Examples -- Aufhebung of Becoming -- Determinate being](Aufhebung#AufhebungOfBecoming)_, this is formalized by the [[level of a topos|level]] given by the [[sharp modality]] in its [[unity of opposites|opposition]] to the [[flat modality]]:

$$
  \array{
     \flat \; &\dashv& \;\;\sharp
     \\
     \vee \; &\nearrow_{\mathrlap{Dasein}}& \;\;\vee
     \\
     \emptyset \; &\dashv& \;\;\ast
  }
  \,.
$$

So $\sharp$ is a higher [[level of a topos|level]] version of $\ast$ ([[being]]). Indeed, this is the statement of ([SoL &#167; 194](Science+of+Logic#194)).
