## Idea


InfraBayesianism is an extension of Bayesian reasoning that allows for more flexible modeling and reasoning under uncertainty developped by Vanessa Kosoy and Alex Appel. By using a generalized notion of probability called infradistributions, infraBayesianism provides a way to reason with ambiguous or incomplete information, which is not possible within the classical Bayesian framework.

Infradistributions generalize the credal sets of imprecise probability which in turn generalize probability distributions.
