Recall that [[strict omega-groupoid]]s are [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to [[crossed complex]]es.

There is a [[cofibrantly generated model category|cofibrantly generated]] [[model category|model structure]] on crossed complexes given in

* Ronald Brown, Marek Golasinski; _A model structure for the homotopy theory of crossed complexes_ ([numdam](http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/fitem?id=CTGDC_1989__30_1_61_0))

>One would expect that this is the restriction of the [[folk model structure]] on [[strict omega-category|string omega-categories]] to strict $\infty$-groupoids. Is there a reference for that?
