## Idea

There is a [[cofibrantly generated model category|cofibrantly generated]] ("[[folk model structure|folk]]") [[model category|model structure]] on the category of [[strict ∞-groupoid]]s, equivalently that of [[crossed complex]]es:

* [[Ronnie Brown]], Marek Golasinski; _A model structure for the homotopy theory of crossed complexes_ ([numdam](http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/fitem?id=CTGDC_1989__30_1_61_0))

>One would expect that this is the restriction of the [[folk model structure]] on [[strict omega-category|strict omega-categories]] to strict $\infty$-groupoids. Is there a reference for that?
