The univalent foundations for mathematics refers to any foundational system in which universes are [[object classifiers]], or equivalently satisfy the [[univalence axiom]]

#In higher category theory#

#In type theory#
Voevodsky's univalent foundations are an extension of [[dependent type theory|Martin-Lof's dependent type theory]] with

* The [[univalence axiom]]
* [[propositional truncations]]

[[function extensionality|Function extensionality]] can be derived from the univalence axiom, so it is not necessary to assume separately. Propositional resizing axioms have been considered. The unimath library notably uses _type in type_, which leads to an inconsistency via [[Girard's paradox]].
