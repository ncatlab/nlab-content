## Idea

Traditionally, as a discipline, __logic__ is the study of correct methods of reasoning.  Logicians have principally studied [[deduction]], the process of passing from premises to conclusion in such a way that the [[truth]] of the former necessitates the truth of the latter. In other words, deductive logic studies what it is for an argument to be _valid_. A second branch of logic studies [[inductive reasoning|induction]], reasoning about how to assess the plausibility of general propositions from observations of their instances. This has often been done in terms of [[probability theory]], particularly [[Bayesian reasoning|Bayesian]].

Some [[philosophy|philosophers]], notably [[Charles Peirce]], considered there to be third variety of reasoning for logic to study, namely, [[abduction]]. This is a process whereby one reasons to the truth of an explanation from its ability to account for what is observed. It is therefore sometimes also known as _inference to the best explanation_. At least some aspects of this can also be studied using Bayesian probability.

Deductive logic is the best developed of the branches. For centuries, treatments of the [[syllogism]] were at the forefront of the discipline. In the nineteenth century, however, spurred largely by the needs of [[mathematics]], in particular the need to handle [[relations]] and [[quantifiers]], a new logic emerged, known today as [[predicate logic]]. 

As we said above, logic is traditionally concerned with *correct* methods of reasoning, and philosophers (and others) have had much to say *prescriptively* about logic.  However, one can also study logic *descriptively*, taking it to be the study of methods of reasoning, without attempting to determine whether these methods are correct. One may study [[constructive logic]], or a [[substructural logic]], without saying that it should be adopted. Also psychologists study how people actually reason rapidly in situations without full information, such as by the [fast and frugal](http://fastandfrugal.com/) approach.

A __logic__ is a specific method of reasoning.  There are several ways to _formalise_ a logic as a [[mathematics|mathematical]] object; see at _[Mathematical Logic](#MathematicalLogic)_ below.


## Mathematical logic
 {#MathematicalLogic}

_Mathematical logic_ or _symbolic logic_ is the study of logic and [[foundations]] of mathematics as, or via, formal systems -- _[[theories]]_ --  such as [[first-order logic]] or [[type theory]].


### Classical subfields

The classical subfields of mathematical logic are

* [[set theory]]

* [[model theory]],

* [[recursion theory]]

* [[proof theory]]

### Categorical logic
 {#CategoricalLogic}

By a convergence and unification of concepts that has been named _[[computational trinitarianism]]_, mathematical logic is equivalently incarnated in 

1. [[type theory]]

1. [[category theory]]

1. [[programming theory]]

The logical theory that is specified by and specifies a given [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$ -- called its _[[internal logic]]_, see there for more details and also see [[internal language]], [[syntactic category]].
-- is the one 

* whose [[types]] are the [[objects]] $A$ of $\mathcal{C}$;

* whose [[contexts]] are the [[slice categories]] $\mathcal{C}_{/A}$;

* whose [[propositions]] in context are the [[(-1)-truncated objects]] $\phi$ of $\mathcal{C}_{/A}$;

* whose [[proofs]] $A \vdash PhiIsTrue : \phi $ are the [[generalized elements]] of $\phi$.

Hence pure mathematical logic in the sense of the study of [[propositions]] is identified with [[(0,1)-category theory]]: where one concentrates only on [[(-1)-truncated objects]]. Genuine [[category theory]], which is about [[0-truncated objects]], is the home for logic and [[set theory]], or rather [[type theory]], the 0-truncated objects being the [[sets]]/[[types]]/[[hSet|h-sets]]. 

For instance, 

* [[limits]] and [[colimits]], [[exponentials]], and [[object classifiers]] belong to the [[type theory]];

* while their (-1)-truncation, in this order: [[intersections]]/([[and]]), [[unions]]([[or]]), [[implications]], and [[subobject classifiers]], belong to the logic.

Generally, [[(∞,1)-category theory]], which is about untruncated objects, is the home for logic and types with a [[constructive mathematics|constructive]] notion of [[equality]], the [[identity types]] in [[homotopy type theory]].

### General
 {#General}

For centuries, logic was [[Aristotle's logic]] of [[deduction]] by [[syllogism]]. In the 19th century the idea of [[objective logic]] as [[metaphysics]] was influential

* [[Hegel]], _Wissenschaft der Logik_ ( _[[Science of Logic]]_ )

This "old logic" was famously criticized 

* [[Bertrand Russell]], _[[Logic as the Essence of Philosophy]]_, 1914

as opposed to the "new logic" of [[Peano]] and [[Frege]], contemporary [[predicate logic]].
