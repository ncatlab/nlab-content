## Idea

As a discipline, __logic__ is the study of methods of reasoning.  While in the past (and often today in philosophical circles), this discipline was prescriptive (describing how one *should* reason), it is increasingly (and usually in mathematical circles) descriptive (describing how one *does* reason).

As a (potentially) mathematical object, a __logic__ is a specific method of reasoning.  There are several ways to formalise this which I decided not to get into now, but maybe later.
