## Idea

In general the term *fictitious gauge field* could refer to any [[auxiliary field|auxiliary]] [[gauge field]]. Specifically the term is used:

* in [[anyon statistics]] for a [[model (in theoretical physics)|model]] of anyons as [[fermions]] which each source and each couple to a flat [[electromagnetic field|U(1)-gauge field]] causing mutual [[Aharonov-Bohm effect|Aharonov-Bohm phases]];

* in [[solid state physics]] for effects analogous to [[Berry curvatures]] caused by [[crystal]] strain or dislocations.

### For anyon statistics
 {#ForAnyonStatistics}

A model for [[anyon statistics]] via otherwise [[free field|free]] [[fermions]] in 2d, mutually [[interaction|interacting]] through a flat "fictitious gauge field"  has been proposed in [Arovas, Schrieffer, Wilczek & Zee 1985](#ArovasSchriefferWilczekZee85), developed in
[Chen, Wilczek, Witten & Halperin 1989](#ChenWilczekWittenHalperin89). This model has been advertized in several early reviews (e.g. [Wilczek 1990, §I.3](#Wilczek90), [Wilczek 1991](#Wilczek91), but seems not to have been developed much since:

The model regards anyons as *a priori* [[free field|free]] [[fermions]], but equipped now with a non-local mutual [[interaction]] via a "fictitious gauge field" ([CWWH89, §2](#ChenWilczekWittenHalperin89)), in that
each of the particles is modeled as the singular source of a [[flat connection|flat]] [[circle bundle with connection|circle connection]] (a [[vector potential]] with vanishing [[field strength]]), which hence exerts no [[Lorentz force]] but has the effect that globally each particle is subject to the same [[Aharonov-Bohm effect]] as would be caused by a tuple of infinite [[solenoids]] piercing through each of the other particle's positions.

For emphasis, from [CWWH89, p. 359](#ChenWilczekWittenHalperin89):

> Here the particles are to be regarded (in the absence of 
interactions) as fermions; the interaction then makes them anyons with statistical 
parameter $\theta = \pi(1 - 1/n)$.

It follows that (quoting from [Fröhlich, Gabbiani & Marchetti 1990, p. 20](#FroehlichGabbianiMarchetti90)):

> If $\theta \in\!\!\!\!\!/ \frac{1}{2}\mathbb{Z}$ the [[space of quantum states|Hilbert space]] of [[anyon]] [[wave functions]] must be chosen to be a space of [[multi-valued functions]] with half-[[monodromies]] given by the [[complex phase|phase]] factors $exp(2 \pi \mathrm{i} \theta)$. Such wave functions can be viewed as single-valued functions on the [[universal cover]] $\widetilde M_n$ of $M_n$ $[$the [[configuration space of points]]$]$.

Incidentally, the [[quasi-particle]]-excitations *of* (or *in*) a gas of such Aharonov-Bohm phased anyons are argued to be [[vortices]] ([CWWH89, p. 457](#ChenWilczekWittenHalperin89)):

> we are led to conclude that *in anyon superconductivity, charged quasi-particles and vortices do not constitute two separate sorts of elementary excitations - they are one and the same.*
