## Statement

Let $A$ be a free associative unital algebra with some set of generators over a field $k$. Then the centralizer or any nonscalar element $u\in A$ is isomorphic to $k[z]$ for some nonscalar element $z\in A$

As a corollary, any two commuting elements in $A$ may be presented as values of two polynomials $P(z), Q(z)$ over $k$ on the same element $z$ in $A$.
