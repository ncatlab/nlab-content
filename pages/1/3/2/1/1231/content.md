__Koszul duality__ is a duality and phenomenon generalizing the duality between the symmetric and exterior algebra of a vector space to so-called quadratic [[differential graded algebra]]s (which can be obtained as a free dga module an ideal of relations which live in degree 2). For a pair of Koszul dual algebras, there is a correspondence between certain parts of their derived categories (precise formulation involves some finiteness conditions). In a setup in which one of the algebras is replaced by a cocomplete dg coalgebra, there is a formulation free of finiteness conditions, but involving [[twisting cochain]] (see that entry).

There is a further generalization to quadratic operads, predicted in

We survey the topology which led to the original bar and cobar constructions,
for both associative algebras and coalgebras and for Lie algebras and
commutative coalgebras. These constructions are often viewed as part of the
larger theory of Koszul duality of operads, so this survey is meant to offer an
historical perspective on the most prominent cases of that theory. We also
explain recent work which shows that Hopf/linking invariants for homotopy are
at the heart of the duality between commutative algebras and Lie coalgebras.

from arXiv Front: math.AT by Andrew J. Blumberg, Michael A. Mandell
We interpret different constructions of the algebraic $K$-theory of spaces as
an instance of derived Koszul (or bar) duality and also as an instance of
Morita equivalence. We relate the interplay between these two descriptions to
the homotopy involution. We define a geometric analog of the Swan theory
$G^{\bZ}(\bZ[\pi])$ in terms of $\Sigma^{\infty}_{+} \Omega X$ and show that it
is the algebraic $K$-theory of the $E_{\infty}$ ring spectrum $DX=S^{X_{+}}$.
