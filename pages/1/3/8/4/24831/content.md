### In classical physics

> The solution of the difficulty that is raised about the motion --- whether it is in the movable --- is plain. It is the fulfilment of this **potentiality**, and by the action of that which has the power of causing motion; and the **actuality** of that which has the power of causing motion is not other than the actuality of the movable, for it must be the fulfilment of both. A thing is capable of causing motion because it can do this, it is a mover because it actually does it. But it is on the movable that it is capable of acting. Hence there is a single actuality of both alike... &lbrack;[Aristotle](#Aristotle), as reproduced in [Jaeger (2017), p. 7](#Jaeger17), our emphasis&rbrack;

### In quantum physics

Regarding the [[modality|modal]] nature of [[quantum states]] in [[quantum physics]]:

> In throwing dice we do not know the fine details of the motion of our hands which determine the fall of the dice and therefore we say that the probability for throwing a special number is just one in six. The probability wave of Bohr, Kramers, Slater, however, meant more that; it meant a tendency for something. It was a quantitative version of the old concept of "**potentia**" in Aristotelian philosophy. It introduced something standing in the middle between the idea of an event and the **actual** event, a strange kind of physical reality just in the middle between possibility and reality. &lbrack;[Heisenberg (1958)](#Heisenberg1958), our emphasis&rbrack;
