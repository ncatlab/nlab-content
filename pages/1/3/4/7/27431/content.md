## Idea

The analogue of a [[spatial locale]] for [[sigma-locale|$\sigma$-locales]]

## Definitions

Let $X$ be a [[sigma-topological space|$\sigma$-topological space]]. Then we may define a [[sigma-locale|$\sigma$-locale]], denoted $O(X)$, whose $\sigma$-frame of opens is precisely the [[sigma-frame|$\sigma$-frame]] of [[open subspaces]] of $X$.

A locale is **spatial** or **topological** if it is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to $O(X)$ for some $\sigma$-topological space $X$.

A locale $L$ has __enough points__ if, given any two opens $U$ and $V$ in $L$, $U = V$ if (hence iff) precisely the same points of $L$ belong to $U$ as belong to $V$.
