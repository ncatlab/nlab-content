## About ##

This is the nLab page for Jacob Biamonte.  

My life was fine.  I was happy, content if you will.  I was working on two types of networks.  Then I met John Baez and my dual-network world turned upside down.  Now I'm working on what I jokingly and seriously call at the same time, _a grand unified theory of networks_.  John even managed to sneak in some of his [green mathematics](http://ncatlab.org/johnbaez/show/green+mathematics).
