## Idea

Computational [[constructive mathematics|constructive]] [[homological algebra]].

Computational Homological Algebra is the study of the design and implementation of  mathematical algorithms for examining the  homological properties of discrete algebraic structures such as groups, monoids, Lie algebras, etc. It also has started looking at higher dimensional algebraic structures that arise in homological algebra and homotopy theory.
