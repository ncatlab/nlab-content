An **algebraic Kan complex** is a [[Kan complex]] equipped with a _choice_ of [[horn]] fillers.

Algebraic Kan complexes give a [[algebraic definition of higher categories|algebraic definition of]] [[âˆž-groupoid]]s.

For more see  the section [Algebraic  fibrant models for higher categories](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/model+structure+on+algebraic+fibrant+objects#AlgebaicHigherCategories) at [[model structure on algebraic fibrant objects]].

A slight variant of this definition is that of a [[simplicial T-complex]].
