## Idea

The notion of _algebraic Kan complex_ is an [[algebraic definition of higher categories|algebraic definition of]] [[∞-groupoid]]s.

It builds on the classical [[geometric definition of higher categories|geometric definition]] of $\infty$-groupoids in terms of [[Kan complex]]es. A Kan complex is like an algebraic $\infty$-groupoid in which we have forgotten what precisely the [[composition]] operation and what the [[inverse]]s are, and only know that they do exist. This becomes an _algebraic model_ for $\infty$-groupoids by adding the specific choices of composites back in. 

The nontrivial aspect of the definition of algebraic Kan complexes is that they do still [[presentable (∞,1)-category|present]] the full [[(∞,1)-category]] [[∞Grpd]]. Notably the [[homotopy hypothesis]] is true for algebraic Kan complexes.

## Definition



An **algebraic Kan complex** is a [[Kan complex]] equipped with a _choice_ of [[horn]] fillers for all horns.

A morphism of algebraic Kan complexes is a morphism of the underlying Kan complexes that sends chosen fillers to chosen fillers.

This defines the category $Alg Kan$ of algebraic Kan complexes.

For more see the section [Algebraic  fibrant models for higher categories](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/model+structure+on+algebraic+fibrant+objects#AlgebaicHigherCategories) at [[model structure on algebraic fibrant objects]].


A slight variant of this definition is that of *[[simplicial T-complexes]]*.


## Properties

### Monadicity

The category $Alg Kan$ is the category of algebras over a [[monad]]

$$
  sSet \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\to}  Alg sSet
  \,.
$$

This means that algebraic Kan complexes are formally an _algebraic model_ for higher categories.

See [[model structure on algebraic fibrant objects]] for details.

### Homotopy hypothesis-theorem

The [[homotopy hypothesis]] is true for algebraic Kan complexes: 

there is a [[model category]] structure on $Alg Kan$ -- the [[model structure on algebraic fibrant objects]] -- and a [[Quillen equivalence]] to the standard [[model structure on simplicial sets]].

Moreover, there is a direct [[Quillen equivalence]]

$$
  \Pi_\infty : Top \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\to} AlgKan : |-|_r
  \,,
$$

to the standard [[model structure on topological spaces]], where the [[left adjoint]] $|-|_r$ is a quotient of the [[geometric realization]] of the underlying Kan complexes and $\Pi_\infty$ is a version of the [[fundamental ∞-groupoid]]-functor with values in algebraic Kan complexes. 

See <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/homotopy+hypothesis#ForAlgebraicKanComplexes">homotopy hypothesis -- for algebraic Kan complexes</a> for details.

### Algebraicization

If we assume the [[axiom of choice]], then any [[Kan complex]] can be made into an algebraic Kan complex by making a simultaneous choice of a filler for every horn.

In the absence of AC, one might argue that algebraic Kan complexes are a better model of $\infty$-groupoids than non-algebraic ones.  For instance, an algebraic Kan complex always has the right lifting property with respect to all [[anodyne morphisms]], whereas for a non-algebraic Kan complex this fact requires choice.
