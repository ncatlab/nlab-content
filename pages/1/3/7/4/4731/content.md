## Idea

The notion of _connection on a 2-bundle_ generalizes the notion of [[connection on a bundle]] from [[principal bundle]]s to [[principal 2-bundle]]s.

It comes with a notion of [[higher parallel transport|2-dimensional parallel transport]].

## Definition

For $G$ a [[Lie 2-group]], a _connection_ on a $G$-[[principal 2-bundle]] coming from a [[cocycle]] $g : X \to \mathbf{B}G$ is a lift of the cocycle to the  [[2-groupoid of Lie 2-algebra valued forms]] $\mathbf{B}G_{conn}$

$$
  \array{
     && \mathbf{B}G_{conn}
     \\
     & {}^{\mathllap{\nabla}}\nearrow & \downarrow
     \\
     X &\stackrel{g}{\to}& \mathbf{B}G
  }
$$
