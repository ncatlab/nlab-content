## Idea

A _sylleptic monoidal (weak) 2-category_ is a [[monoidal 2-category]] with a categorified sort of "commutativity" that lies in between a [[braided monoidal 2-category|braiding]] and a [[symmetric monoidal 2-category|symmetry]].

That is, it is a [[2-category]] $C$ equipped with a [[tensor product]] $\otimes : C \times C \to C$ [[2-functor]] which satisfies the first two in a hierarchy of conditions for being commutative up to equivalence.  In the language of [[k-tuply monoidal n-category|k-tuply monoidal n-categories]], a braided monoidal 2-category is a *triply monoidal 2-category*.  As described there, this may be identified with a pointed 5-category with a single $k$-morphism for $k=0,1,2$.  We can also say that it is a monoidal 2-category whose [[En-algebra|E1-algebra]] structure is refined to an [[En-algebra|E3-algebra]] structure.
