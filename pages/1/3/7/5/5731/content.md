## Definitions

A [[function]] $f$ between [[complex manifolds]] is __holomorphic__ if it is complex-[[differentiable function|differentiable]], or equivalently complex-[[analytic functions|analytic]].  One may also see definitions referring to the intermediate notions of [[continuously differentiable function|continuous differentiability]] or [[infinitely differentiable function|infinite differentiability]].

The theorem that every continuously complex-differentiable function is analytic is soft and due to [[Augustin Cauchy]]; the theorem that every complex-differentiable function is continuously differentiable is hard and due essentially to [[Édouard Goursat]] (which may be seen as filling in a gap in Cauchy's proof).  See [[Cauchy integral formula]] and [[Goursat theorem]].

On infinite-dimensional manifolds, we have several notions of holomorphic function; see [Wikipeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite-dimensional_holomorphy).
