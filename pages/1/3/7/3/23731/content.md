## Idea

In [[solid state physics]], a *semiconductor* is a [[crystal|crystalline]] material for which the [[electron]] [[chemical potential]] lies in a *small* gap between a [[valence band]] and a [[conduction band]]. 

This means that a semi-conductor behaves like an [[insulator]] unless a little extra energy is supplied to lift the electrons out of the [[valence bundle]] into the [[conduction bundle]], in which case it starts behaving like a [[conductor]] (or [[metal]]). 

This "external switching" of electron conductivity in semi-conductors is the basis of [[transistors]] and hence of [[digital computers]].
