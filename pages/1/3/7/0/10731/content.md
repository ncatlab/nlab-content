## Statement

Write $MU$ for the [[E-âˆž ring]] [[spectrum]] of [[complex cobordism cohomology theory]]. Since this is a [[complex oriented cohomology theory]], by [[Lazard's theorem]] there is associated a commutative 1-dimensional [[formal group law]] classified by a [[ring]] homomorphism of the form

$$
  L \longrightarrow \pi_\bullet(MU)
$$

from the [[Lazard ring]] $L$.

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

This canonical homomorphism is an [[isomorphism]] 

$$
  L \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} \pi_\bullet(MU)
  \,.
$$

=--

This is due to [Quillen 69](#Quillen69)


+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

The dual generalized [[Steenrod algebra]] $MU_\bullet(MU)$ has a structure of 
[[Hopf algebroid over a commutative base]] which is the 
[[Lazard ring]].
This is the content of the [[Landweber-Novikov theorem]].
