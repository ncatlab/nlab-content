## Statement

Write $MU$ for the [[E-âˆž ring]] [[spectrum]] of [[complex cobordism cohomology theory]]. Since this is a [[complex oriented cohomology theory]], by [[Lazard's theorem]] there is associated a commutative 1-dimensional [[formal group law]] classified by a [[ring]] homomorphism of the form

$$
  L \longrightarrow \pi_\bullet(MU)
$$

from the [[Lazard ring]] $L$.

###### Theorem

This canonical homomorphism is an [[isomorphism]] 

$$
  L \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} \pi_\bullet(MU)
  \,.
$$

=--

This is due to ([Quillen 69](#Quillen69)), based on ([Milnor 60](#Milnor60)), reproduced e.g. as ([Kochmann 96, theorem 4.4.13](#Kochmann96)).

**Proof strategy:** (for Milnor's part) Compute the [[homology of MU]] and apply the [[Boardman homomorphism]] to get the statement over the [[rational numbers]]. Deduce that $\pi_\bullet(MU)$ is finitely generated so that it is now sufficient to prove it over the [[p-adic integers]] for all $p$. Using the [[change of rings theorem]], this finally follows from inspection of the filtration in the $H\mathbb{F}_p$-[[Adams spectral sequence]] for $MU$.

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

The dual generalized [[Steenrod algebra]] $MU_\bullet(MU)$ has a structure of 
[[Hopf algebroid over a commutative base]] which is the 
[[Lazard ring]].
This is the content of the [[Landweber-Novikov theorem]].
