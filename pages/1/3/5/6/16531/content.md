While is "completion" a very general term for a number of notions in mathematics, many of them are in the sense of completions under some sort of limits. In that case, sometimes one uses the term __cocompletion__ for a dual case of completing under colimits. For example, [[free cocompletion]]
and [[ind-cocompletion]].
