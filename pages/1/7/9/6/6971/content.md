## Idea

_Extensional type theory_ the flavor of [[type theory]] where [[identity types]] are demanded to be [[propositions]] / of [[h-level 1]].

Type theory which is not extensional is called _[[intensional type theory]]_.

Notice that this use of "extensional" is not related to -- and in fact sometimes in contradiction to -- _[[function extensionality]]_.

Notably [[homotopy type theory]] is [[intensional type theory|intensiona]] in that [[identity types]] are crucially _not_ demanded to be [[propositions]], but with the [[univalence axiom]] included the theory satisfies [[function extensionality]] (by terms of these intensional identity types, of course). 

## Properties

### Decidability

Only the intensional but not the [[extensional type theory|extensional]] [[Martin-LÃ¶f type theory]] is [[decidable]]. See _[[intensional type theory]]_ for more on this.
