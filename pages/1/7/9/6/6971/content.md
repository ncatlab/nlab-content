## Idea

_Extensional type theory is_ the flavor of [[type theory]] in which two terms $f, g$ of [[function types]] are identified already if all their values agree. 

If this distinction is not made, one speaks of [[intensional type theory]].

## Properties

### Decidibility

Only the intensional but not the [[extensional type theory|extensional]] [[Martin-LÃ¶f type theory]] is [[decidable]]. See _[[intensional type theory]]_ for more on this.
