The axiom of __countable choice__, also called $AC_\omega$ or $AC_N$, is a weak form of the [[axiom of choice]]; it says that the set of [[natural number]]s is a [[projective object]] in [[Set]].  (Recall that the full axiom of choice states that *every* set is projective.)

More explicitly, let $X$ be any [[set]] and let $p: X \to \mathbf{N}$ be a [[surjection]].  Then the axiom of countable choice states that $p$ has a [[section]].  If you phrase the axiom of choice in terms of [[entire relations]], then countable choice states that any entire relation from $\mathbf{N}$ to any other set contains (in the [[2-poset]] [[Rel]]) a [[functional relation|functional]] entire relation.

Unlike the full axiom of choice, countable choice is often considered to be a [[constructive mathematics|constructively]] acceptable principle.  In particular, it does not imply the principle of [[excluded middle]].  It is a consequence of [[COSHEP]].  A stronger version of countable choice, also a consequence of COSHEP, is the axiom of [[dependent choice]].

Sometimes in foundations it is useful to consider a weaker version of countable choice, called $AC_{00}$.  This states that any entire relation from $\mathbf{N}$ to itself contains a functional entire relation.  In terms of surjections, this states that any surjection $p\colon X \to \mathbf{N}$ has a section if $X$ is a [[subset]] of $\mathbf{N} \times \mathbf{N}$ and $p$ is the [[restriction]] to $X$ of a product projection.
