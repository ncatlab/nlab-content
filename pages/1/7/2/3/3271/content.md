**Victor Ginzburg** is a professor of mathematics at the University of Chicago. His thesis in Moscow was under Kirillov. His main interests are [[representation theory]], especially geometric representation theory, including more recently [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]]. 

Warning: there is another mathematician (global analysis, [[symplectic geometry]]), **Viktor** Ginzburg (note the English spelling).
