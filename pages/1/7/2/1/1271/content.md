An __element__ of an object $W$ in a fixed [[abelian category]] $A$ is an *equivalence class* $[X,h]$ of pairs $(X,h)$ where $X$ is an object of $A$ and $h:X\to A$ morphism and the equivalence is defined as follows: $[X,h] = [Y,k]$ iff there exists an object $Z$ in $A$ and [[epimorphism]]s $u:Z\to X$, $v:Z\to Y$ such that $h\circ u = k\circ v$. 

Elements in an abelian category can be used for [[diagram chasing]].

An element in an abelian category is an equivalence class of [[generalized element]]s.

I disagree with the change of title. It is by no means an ELEMENT OF AN ABELIAN CATEGORY. It is an element of an OBJECT in an abelian category; thus abbreviation which I used before, while imprecise (element in abelian category -- meaning element in (the setting of) abelian category) is at least not plainly conflicting with reality as this one.
People DO say "let's use elements in the abelian category for this proof", but they do not say this is an element of that abelian category. So if you disagree with previous title then put whole name "element of an object in abelian category" or alike. --Zoran

Sorry, I understand.  I thought that this was just a grammar error, like leaving out 'an'.  Now that I look at it again, it\'s obviously 'in', and can\'t imagine why I thought that it should be 'of'.  I\'ll fix it.  ---Toby
