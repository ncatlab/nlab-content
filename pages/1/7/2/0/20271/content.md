## Idea

A _generalized Spin(7)-structure_ on an [[8-manifold]] $X$ is a [[reduction of the structure group]] of the [[generalized tangent bundle]] $T X \oplus T^\ast X$ along the inclusion of the [[direct product group]] of two copies of [[Spin(7)]] into the [[spin group|spin]]-[[Narain group]], along

$$
  Spin(7) \times Spin(7) \longrightarrow Spin(8,8)
  \,.
$$

This generalizes the [[reduction of the structure group|reduction]] of the plain [[tangent bundle]] along the inclusion of [[Spin(7)]] into [[Spin(8)]]

$$
  Spin(7) \hookrightarrow Spin(8)
$$ 

which goes with [[Spin(7)-manifolds]], whence the name.
