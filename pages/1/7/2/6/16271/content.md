## About

Meister Eckhart was a medieval christian [[mystic]].


> The German monk Meister Eckhart (1260-1327) was the first to develop the terminology of philosophy in German, translating and adapting Latin terms. For him, God becomes conscious of himself only within his creation. Eckhart also argues that Divine Knowledge is 'the negation of negation'. As with other mystics, Eckhart's aim was the unification of the soul with God. Christ is continually born within each believing soul. Using a passage passed on to him by the mystic von Baader, Hegel quotes Eckhart:
The eye with which God sees me is the eye with which I see Him; my eye and His eye are the same... If He did not exist, nor would I; ([source](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/smith-cyril/works/articles/interim.htm))
