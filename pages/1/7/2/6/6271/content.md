## Idea

_Borel's theorem_ says that every [[power series]] is the [[Taylor series]] of some [[smooth function]]. In other words: for every collection of prescribed [[partial derivatives]] at some point, there is a smooth function having these as actual partial derivatives.

## Statement

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

The canonical map from the ring of germs of $C^\infty$ function at $0\in\mathbb{R}^n$ to the ring of formal power series obtained
by taking the Taylor series at $0$ is surjective.

There are many extensions and variants. 


For $\mathbb{R}^{n+m}$ a [[Cartesian space]] of [[dimension]] $n+m \in \mathbb{N}$, write $C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^{n+m})$ for the $\mathbb{R}$-[[associative algebra|algebra]] of [[smooth function]]s with values in $\mathbb{R}$.

Write $m^\infty_{\mathbb{R}^n \times \{0\}} \subset C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^{n+m})$ for the ideal of functions all whose [[partial derivative]]s along $\mathbb{R}^m$ vanish.

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

Forming the [[Taylor series]] constitutes an [[isomorphism]]

$$
  C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^{n+m})/m^\infty_{\mathbb{R}^n \times \{0\}}
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n) [ [ Y_1, \cdots, Y_m] ]
$$

between smooth functions modulo those whose derivatives along $\mathbb{R}^m$ vanish and the ring of [[power series]] in $m$-variables over $C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)$.

This appears for instance as ([Moerdijk-Reyes, theorem I.1.3](#MoerdijkReyes)).
