## Definition

\begin{definition}
A [[topological space]] $X$ is a **polyhedron** if it is [[homeomorphic]] to the [[geometric realization]] of a [[simplicial complex]] and hence has a [[triangulation]].
\end{definition}

## Properties

\begin{remark}
The study of polyhedra has been one of the sources for methods and applications in [[algebraic topology]], and it is often useful to go back to see the motivations and applications in the older sources.  For instance,  [[shape]] morphisms between polyhedral spaces are just [[homotopy classes]] of [[continuous maps]] so the Cech invariants of polyhedra coincide with their ordinary 'standard' invariants.     
\end{remark}
