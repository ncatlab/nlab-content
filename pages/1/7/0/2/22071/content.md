## Definition

A [[model category]] is __pointed__ if its underlying category
is a [[pointed category]], i.e., the unique
map from the [[initial object]] to the [[terminal object]] is an [[isomorphism]],
in which case both of them are denoted by $0$.

In any pointed category, one has a canonical __zero morphism__
between any objects $A$ and $B$,
given by the composition $A\to 0\to B$.

The [[homotopy equalizer]] of $f\colon A\to B$ and $0\colon A\to B$ is known as the [[homotopy fiber]] of $f$.

The [[homotopy coequalizer]] of $f\colon A\to B$ and $0\colon A\to B$ is known as the [[homotopy cofiber]] of $f$.
