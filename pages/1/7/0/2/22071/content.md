## Definition

A [[model category]] is __pointed__ if its underlying [[category]]
is a [[pointed category]], i.e., if the unique
[[morphism]] from the [[initial object]] to the [[terminal object]] is an [[isomorphism]], in which case both of them are denoted by $0$ (the [[zero object]]).

In any pointed category, one has a canonical *[[zero morphism]]*
between any [[pair]] of objects $A$ and $B$, given by the [[composition]] $A\to 0\to B$.

The [[homotopy equalizer]] of $f\colon A\to B$ and $0\colon A\to B$ is known as the [[homotopy fiber]] of $f$.

The [[homotopy coequalizer]] of $f\colon A\to B$ and $0\colon A\to B$ is known as the [[homotopy cofiber]] of $f$.

In particuar there is the homotopy (co)-fiber of the [[zero object]] with itself, the [[loop space object]]- and [[reduced suspension]]-operation. Asking these operations to be equivalences in a suitable sense leads to the concept of _[[linear model categories]]_ and _[[stable model categories]]_.

## Examples

Model categories which are pointed without being [[linear model category|linear]] or even [[stable model category|stable]]:

\begin{example}\label{ModelCategoriesOfPointedObjects}
**([[model categories of pointed objects]])**
\linebreak
  Given any model category, its [[model category of pointed objects]] is a pointed model category.

In the case of the [[classical model structure on topological spaces]] this is the [[classical model structure on pointed topological spaces]].
\end{example}


Pointed model categories which are [[stable model category|stable]]:

* [[model structure on spectra]]
