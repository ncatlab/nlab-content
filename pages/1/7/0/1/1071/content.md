An additive functor $F$ from a [[triangulated category]] $A$ (with translation denoted $X\mapsto X[1]$) to an abelian category $C$ is a __cohomological functor__ if for any distinguished triangle 
$$
X\stackrel{f}\to Y\stackrel{g}\to Z\stackrel{h}\to X[1],
$$
in $A$, the sequence $FX\stackrel{Ff}\to FY\stackrel{Fg}\to FZ$ is exact in $C$.
