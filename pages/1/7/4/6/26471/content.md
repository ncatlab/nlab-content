##Â Idea

A [[strict total order]] which is not a [[connected relation]]. 

## Definition

A **strict weak order** is a [[strict preorder]] $\lt$ for which the incomparability relation $\neg (x \lt y) \wedge \neg (y \lt x)$ is an [[equivalence relation]]. 

Strict weak orders are used in models of the real numbers which have [[infinitesimals]], such as in the smooth real numbers in [[synthetic differential geometry]], and thus where not every real number not greater than or less than zero is equal to zero. 

## Properties

\begin{theorem}
Strict weak orders are [[cotransitive relations]].
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
...
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
Strict weak orders are [[asymmetric relations]].
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Transitivity of $\lt$ says that for all $x \in S$ and $y \in S$, $x \lt y$ and $y \lt x$ implies $x \lt x$. However, irreflexivity says that for all $x$, $x \leq x$ is always false. This implies that for all $x$ and $y$, $x \lt y$ and $y \lt x$ is always true, which is precisely the condition of asymmetry. 
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
Connected strict weak orders are [[pseudo-orders]].
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof is the same as above, except both relevant orders are [[connected relations]]. 
\end{proof}

The negation of a strict weak order is a [[preorder]] $a \leq b \coloneqq \neg(b \lt a)$, and thus has an [[equivalence relation]] defined as $a \approx b \coloneqq a \leq b \wedge b \leq a$.
