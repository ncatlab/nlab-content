#Idea

An affinoid algebra is a local model for [[rigid analytic geometry]]. 

#Definition

Let $K$ be a complete [[ultrametric field]]. 

As a [[ring]], a __standard affinoid algebra__ (or Tate algebra) $T_{n,K}$ is the subring of the ring of formal power series in $K[ [x_1, \ldots, x_n] ]$ consisting of all strictly converging series $ c= \sum_I c_I x^I$, that is such that $|c_I|\to 0$ as $I\to \infty$. 

A version of the [[Weierstrass preparation theorem]] in this context implies a version of the Hilbert basis theorem: $T_{n,K}$ is a [[noetherian ring]]. Moreover $T_{n,K}$ is a [[unique factorization domain]] of [[Krull dimension]] $n$. 

There is a Gauss norm on such series $\|\sum_I c_I x^I \| = max\{|c_I|\}_I$. This is indeed a norm making $T_{n,K}$ into a Banach $K$-algebra of countable type. 

An __affinoid algebra__ is any [[Banach algebra]] which can be represented in a form (Tate algebra)/(closed ideal).
