## Idea

A [[locally small category]] cannot admit all large discrete [[colimits]] unless it is a [[preorder]] (by an argument of [[Peter Freyd|Freyd]] see *[[complete small category]]*). However, many nice locally small categories admit *some* large colimits.

This page is intended to act as a reference for classes of large colimits that are commonly encountered, and the class of categories that admit them.

On this page, categories will be assumed [[locally small]] unless stated otherwise.

## Colimits versus limits

While this page focuses on categories with large *colimit* properties, these often imply strong *[[complete category|completeness]]* properties. For instance, compact categories (below) are [[complete]], but not always [[cocomplete]].

## Cointersections of epimorphims

Many locally small categories admit small colimits and [[E-colimits]] for $E$ a class of epimorphisms, i.e. [[cointersections]] of morphisms in $E$.

Evidently, a small-[[cocomplete category]] that is [[well powered category|co-well-powered]] will admit cointersections of all [[epimorphisms]], though not all relevant examples are co-well-powered.

### Extremal epimorphisms

When $E$ is the [[class]] of [[extremal epimorphisms]], such a category is called **Isbell-cocomplete** in §2.2 of [BKR15](#BKR15).

### Strong epimorphisms

When $E$ is the [[class]] of [[strong epimorphisms]], such a category is called **well-cocomplete**.

### Regular epimorphisms

The [[free cocompletion]] of a locally small category $A$ under small colimits and [[cointersections]] of [[regular epimorphisms]] is the [[full subcategory]] of the [[presheaf category]] $[A^{op}, Set]$ on the [[weak multilimit|weakly multirepresentable presheaves]] (also called **petty** presheaves). See Remark 4.39 of [Lack & Tendas 2024](#LackTendas2023) (such categories are called **well-cocomplete** in this paper, though conflicts with the earlier terminology).

Theorem 1 of [Kelly & Koubek 1981](#KellyKoubek1981) states that every [[functor]] $F \colon K \to A$, where $A$ has such colimits, admits a colimit if $F$ has a [[weakly terminal set]].

## Adjointness

### Total category

A [[total category]] is a category whose [[Yoneda embedding]] admits a [[left adjoint]]. Every total category is compact in the sense below.

### Compact categories

A category $A$ is **[[compact category|compact]]** in the sense of [Isbell (1968)](#Isbell68) if every (large-)[[cocontinuous functor]] from $A$ has a [[right adjoint]].

> Beware that this is *un-related* to the notion of [[compact closed category]].

Every compact category has small [[limits]] and [[intersections]] of [[monomorphisms]], but not necessarily small colimits. A [[counterexample]] is mentioned in §3.15 of [Börger et al.](#Borger1981).

A category $A$ is called **strongly compact** in [Brandenburg](#Brandenburg2021) if every small-[[cocontinuous functor]] from $A$ has a [[right adjoint]]. Every strongly compact category is consequently compact.

## All large colimits

Despite its ill behaviour, it is possible to describe the cocompletion of a locally small category $A$ under large colimits (assuming the [[law of excluded middle]]): it is given by the [[functor category]] $[A^{op}, 2]$ where $2$ is the [[interval category]]. In particular, this gives rise to a [[lax-idempotent pseudomonad]] whose unit components are (unusually) not [[representably fully faithful]]. (One might argue this disqualifies it from being a "cocompletion" in the traditional sense.) See the discussion following Example 26 of [Walker](#Walker2019).
