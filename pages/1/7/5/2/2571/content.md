The commonly accepted standard [[foundation of mathematics]] today is a material [[set theory]], $\mathbf{ZFC}$ or Zermelo--Frankel set theory with the [[axiom of choice]].


## History

The first version was developed by [[Ernst Zermelo]] in 1908; in 1922, [[Abraham Fraenkel]] and [[Thoralf Skolem]] independently proposed a precise first-order version with the [[axiom of replacement]]; finally, Zermelo added the [[axiom of foundation]] in 1930.  All of these versions included the axiom of choice, but this was considered controversial for some time; one has merely $\mathbf{ZF}$ if it is taken out.

$\mathbf{ZFC}$ is similar to the [[class]] theories $\mathbf{NBG}$ (due to [[John von Neumann]], [[Paul Bernays]], and [[Kurt GÃ¶del]]) and $\mathbf{MK}$ (due to [[Anthony Morse]] and [[John Kelley]]) are similar; the former is a conservative, finitely axiomatisable extension, while the latter is stronger, equivalent to postulating an [[inaccessible cardinal]].

Contemporary set theorists often accept additional [[large cardinal]] axioms.  There are also weak versions, especially for [[constructive mathematics|constructive]] and [[predicative mathematics|predicative]] mathematics.  Then there are alternatives on a different basis, notably $\mathbf{NFU}$ (a very impredicative material set theory) and **[[ETCS]]** (a [[structural set theory]]).

(My source for this history, especially the dates, is mostly [the English Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory).)


## Axioms

$\mathbf{ZFC}$ is a [[material set theory]], based on a global binary __membership__ [[predicate]] $\in$.  Everything in standard $\mathbf{ZFC}$ is a [[pure set]], which we will call simply a set; but there are also variations with [[urelement]]s and [[classes]].  Urelements may be distinguished from sets and classes since they have no elements (although the [[empty set]] also has no elements); sets are those classes that are themselves elements (members) of sets.

1.  Extensionality:  If two sets (or classes) have the same members, then they are __[[equality|equal]]__ and themselves members of the same sets.  See [[axiom of extensionality]] for variations, such as whether this is taken as a definition or an axiomatisation of equality of sets, and how the condition might be strengthened if (10) is left out.

2.  Null set:  There is an __[[empty set]]__: a set $\empty$ with no elements.  By (1), it follows that this set is unique; by even the weakest version of (5), it is enough to state the existence of some set.  (Analogous remarks apply to most of the other axioms.)

3.  Pairing:  If $a$ and $b$ are sets, then there is a set $\{a,b\}$, the __[[finite set|unordered pairing]]__ of $a$ and $b$, whose elements are precisely those sets equal to $A$ or $B$.  Between them, (2) and (3) form a nullary/binary pair; the unary version follows from (3), since $\{a\} = \{a,a\}$ by (1).

4.  Union:  If $\mathcal{C}$ is a set, then there is a set $\bigcup \mathcal{C}$, the __[[union]]__ of $\mathcal{C}$, whose elements are precisely the elements of the elements of $\mathcal{C}$.  It is normal to write $A \cup B$ for $\bigcup \{A,B\}$, etc.  Besides its own power, this gives ternary and higher versions of (3), with $\{a,b,c\} = \{a\} \cup \{b,c\}$, etc.

5.  Separation/Specification/Comprehension:  Given any predicate $\phi[x]$ in the language of set theory with the chosen free variable shown, if $U$ is a set, then there is a set $\{x \in U \;|\; \phi[x]\}$, the __[[subset]]__ of $U$ given by $\phi$, whose elements are precisely those elements $x$ of $U$ such that $\phi[x]$ holds.  There are many variations, which we should probably describe at [[axiom of separation]].  This is an axiom scheme, but it can be made a single axiom in $\mathbf{NBG}$ (but not completely in $\mathbf{MK}$).

6.  Replacement/Collection:  Given a predicate $\psi[x,Y]$ with the chosen free variables shown, if $U$ is a set and if for every $x$ in $U$ there is a unique $Y$ such that $\psi[x,Y]$ holds, then there is set $\{\iota\,Y.\;\psi[x,Y] \;|\; x \in U\}$, the __[[image]]__ of $U$ under $\psi$, whose elements are precisely those sets $Y$ such that there is an element $x$ of $U$ such that $\psi[x,Y]$ holds; if $\Psi[x]$ is a defined term, then we write $\{\Psi[x] \;|\; x \in U\}$ for $\{\iota\,Y.\;Y = \Psi[x] \;|\; x \in U\}$.  Again there are many variations, which we should probably describe at [[axiom of replacement]].  This can be made into a single axiom in both $\mathbf{NBG}$ and $\mathbf{MK}$.  One could combine this with (5) to produce $\{\iota\,Y.\;\psi[x,Y] \;|\; x \in U \;|\; \phi[x]\}$, but nobody seems to do this.

7.  Power set:  If $U$ is a set, then there is a set $\mathcal{P}U$, the __[[power set]]__ of $U$, whose elements are precisely the [[subsets]] of $U$, that is the sets $A$ whose elements are all elements of $U$.  When using [[intuitionistic logic]], it is possible to accept only a weak version of this, such as [[subset collection]] or (even weaker) the existence of [[function sets]].

8.  Infinity:  There is a set $\omega$ of __[[ordinal number|finite ordinals]]__ as pure sets.  Normally one states that $\empty \in \omega$ and $a \cup \{a\} \in \omega$ whenever $a \in \omega$, although variations are possible.  Using any but the weakest version of (6), it is enough to state that there is a set satisfying Peano\'s axioms of [[natural numbers]], or even any Dedekind-[[infinite set]].  It seems to be common to incorporate (2) into (8).

9.  Choice:  If $\mathcal{C}$ is a set, each of whose elements has an element, then there is a set with exactly one element from each element of $\mathcal{C}$.  Note that this set is *not* unique, nor can we construct a canonical version which is, so we do not give it any name or notation.  This version is the simplest to state in the language of $\mathbf{ZFC}$; see [[axiom of choice]] for further discussion.  It is possible to incorporate (9) into (5) or (6), but this seems to be rare.

10. Foundation/Regularity:  Given a formula $\phi$ with a chosen free variable $X$, if $\phi$ holds whenever $\phi[a/X]$ holds for every $a \in X$, then $\phi$ holds absolutely.  For variations, see [[axiom of foundation]].  This scheme can be made into a single axiom even in $\mathbf{ZFC}$ itself (although not in versions with intuitionistic logic, which can be made a single axiom only in a class theory).


## Versions

The axioms (1--5) and (9) in a slightly imprecise form of higher-order [[classical logic]] form Zermelo\'s original version.  The modern $\mathbf{ZFC}$ consists of (1--10) in classical logic, although in fact (1--10) in [[intuitionistic logic]] is equivalent, since [[excluded middle]] follows from (9).

[[Mike Shulman]] takes $\mathbf{CPZ}^{\circlearrowleft-}$ as the most basic form; it consists of (1--4) and the weakest versions of (5&6).
