A __convergence space__ is a [[set]] $S$ together with a [[relation]] $\to$ from $\mathcal{F}S$ to $S$, where $\mathcal{F}S$ is the set of [[filter]]s on $S$, satisfying some axioms.  (If $F \to x$, we say that $F$ __converges__ to $x$.)  The axioms are these:
1. If $F \subseteq G$ and $F \to x$, then $G \to x$;
1. The principal ultrafilter $F_x$ at $x$ converges to $x$;
1. If $F \to x$ and $G \to x$, then $F \cap G \to x$.

It follows that $F \to x$ if and only if $F \cap F_x$ does.  Given that, the convergence space is defined precisely by specifying, for each point $x$, a filter of subsets of the set of subfilters of the principal ultrafilter at $x$.  (But that is sort of a tongue twister.)

A **[[pseudotopological space]]** or **Choquet space** is a convergence space in which furthermore,

* if $F$ is a filter such that for every filter $G \supseteq F$ there exists a filter $H \supseteq G$ with $H \to x$, then $F \to x$.

In a pseudotopological space, we have $F\to x$ if and only if every ultrafilter refining $F$ converges to $x$ (assuming the [[axiom of choice]], or more precisely the [[ultrafilter theorem]]).  Thus a pseudotopology consists precisely of a convergence relation between ultrafilters and points satisfying the single axiom that $F_x$ converges to $x$, for every $x$.

A [[subsequential space]] is a pseudotopological space that may be defined using only [[sequence]]s instead of arbitrary nets/filters.

The morphisms of convergence spaces are the continuous functions; a function $f$ between convergence spaces is __continuous__ if $F \to x$ implies that $f(F) \to f(x)$, where $f(F)$ is the filter generated by the filterbase $\{F(A) \;|\; A \in F\}$.  In this way, convergence spaces form a [[category]] $Conv$.

Any [[topological space]] is a convergence space, and in fact a pseudotopological one: we define $F \to x$ if every neighbourhood of $x$ belongs to $F$.  A convergence space is __topological__ if it comes from a topology on $S$.  The [[full subcategory]] of $Conv$ consisting of the topological convergence spaces is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to the category [[Top]] of topological spaces.  In this way, the definitions in this section all become theorems about topological spaces.  However, not every convergence in analysis is topological; convergence in measure is a good counterexample.

Note that the improper filter (the power set of $S$) converges to every point.  Conversely, a convergence space $S$ is __Hausdorff__ if every proper filter converges to at most one point; then we have a [[partial function]] $\lim$ from $\mathcal{F}S$ to $S$.  A topological space is Hausdorff in the [[Hausdorff space|usual sense]] if and only if it is Hausdorff as a convergence space.

A convergence space $S$ is __compact__ if every proper filter is contained in a convergent filter.  Equivalently (assuming the Boolean prime ideal theorem), $S$ is compact iff every ultrafilter converges.  A topological space is compact in the [[compact space|usual sense]] if and only if it is compact as a convergence space.

The topological convergence spaces can be characterized as the pseudotopological ones in which the convergence satisfies a certain "associativity" condition.  In this way one can think of a topological space as a "multicategory" parametrized by ultrafilters.  In particular, note that a compact Hausdorff pseudotopological space is defined by a single function $\mathcal{U}S\to S$, where $\mathcal{U}S$ is the set of ultrafilters on $S$, such that the composite $S\to \mathcal{U}S \to S$ is the identity.  That is, it is an algebra for the pointed endofunctor $\mathcal{U}$.  The compact Hausdorff _topological_ spaces are precisely the algebras for $\mathcal{U}$ considered as a [[monad]].
