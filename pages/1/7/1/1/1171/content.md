## Idea ##

A convergence space is a generalisation of a [[topological space]] based on the concept of convergent [[filter]] (or [[net]]) as fundamental.  The basic concepts of point-set topology (continuous functions, compact and Hausdorff spaces, etc) make sense also for convergence spaces, although not all theorems hold.  The [[category]] of convergence spaces is a [[quasitopos]] and may be thought of as a [[nice category of spaces]] that includes [[Top]] as a [[full subcategory]].

## Definition ##

A __convergence space__ is a [[set]] $S$ together with a [[relation]] $\to$ from $\mathcal{F}S$ to $S$, where $\mathcal{F}S$ is the set of [[filter]]s on $S$; if $F \to x$, we say that $F$ __converges__ to $x$.  This must satisfy some axioms:
1. Centred: The principal ultrafilter $F_x = \{ A \;|\; x \in A \}$ at $x$ converges to $x$;
1. Isotone: If $F \subseteq G$ and $F \to x$, then $G \to x$;
1. Filtered: If $F \to x$ and $G \to x$, then $F \cap G \to x$.

It follows that $F \to x$ if and only if $F \cap F_x$ does.  Given that, the convergence relation is defined precisely by specifying, for each point $x$, a filter of subfilters of the principal ultrafilter at $x$.  (But that is sort of a tongue twister.)

A filter $F$ __clusters__ at a point $x$ if there exists a proper filter $G$ such that $F \subseteq G$ and $G \to x$.

The definition can also be phrased in terms of [[net]]s; a net $\nu$ converges to $x$ if and only if its eventuality filter converges to $x$.

The morphisms of convergence spaces are the continuous functions; a function $f$ between convergence spaces is __continuous__ if $F \to x$ implies that $f(F) \to f(x)$, where $f(F)$ is the filter generated by the filterbase $\{F(A) \;|\; A \in F\}$.  In this way, convergence spaces form a [[category]] $Conv$.

Note that the definition of 'convergence' varies in the literature; at the extreme end, one could define it any relation from $\mathcal{F}S$ (or even from the class of all nets on $S$) to $S$ whatsoever, but that is so little structure as to be not very useful.  Here we follow the terminology of Lowen-Colebunders.

## Examples ##

In [[measure theory]], given a measure space $X$ and a measurable space $Y$, the space of almost-everywhere defined measurable functions from $X$ to $Y$ becomes a convergence space under convergence almost everywhere.  In general, the convergence space does not fit into any of the examples below.

A [[pseudotopological space]] is a convergence space satisfying the star property:

* If $F$ is a filter such that for every proper filter $G \supseteq F$ there exists a proper filter $H \supseteq G$ with $H \to x$, then $F \to x$.

A [[subsequential space]] is a pseudotopological space that may be defined using only [[sequence]]s instead of arbitrary nets/filters.

Any [[topological space]] is a convergence space, and in fact a pseudotopological one: we define $F \to x$ if every neighbourhood of $x$ belongs to $F$.  A convergence space is __topological__ if it comes from a topology on $S$.  The [[full subcategory]] of $Conv$ consisting of the topological convergence spaces is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to the category [[Top]] of topological spaces.  In this way, the definitions below all become theorems about topological spaces.

## Properties ##

The improper filter (the [[power set]] of $S$) converges to every point.  On the other hand, a convergence space $S$ is __Hausdorff__ if every proper filter converges to at most one point; then we have a [[partial function]] $\lim$ from the proper filters on $S$ to $S$.  A topological space is Hausdorff in the [[Hausdorff space|usual sense]] if and only if it is Hausdorff as a convergence space.

A convergence space $S$ is __compact__ if every proper filter clusters at some point; that is, every proper filter is contained in a convergent proper filter.  Equivalently (assuming the [[ultrafilter theorem]]), $S$ is compact iff every ultrafilter converges.  A topological space is compact in the [[compact space|usual sense]] if and only if it is compact as a convergence space.

The topological convergence spaces can be characterized as the pseudotopological ones in which the convergence satisfies a certain "associativity" condition.  In this way one can think of a topological space as a "multicategory" parametrized by ultrafilters.  In particular, note that a compact Hausdorff pseudotopological space is defined by a single function $\mathcal{U}S \to S$, where $\mathcal{U}S$ is the set of ultrafilters on $S$, such that the composite $S \to \mathcal{U}S \to S$ is the identity.  That is, it is an [[algebra for an endofunctor|algebra]] for the [[pointed endofunctor]] $\mathcal{U}$.  The compact Hausdorff _topological_ spaces are precisely the algebras for $\mathcal{U}$ considered as a [[monad]].
