## Idea

Yang--Mills theory is a [[gauge theory]] on 4-dimensional (pseudo)[[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian]] [[manifold]] $X$ whose field is the [[Yang–Mills field]] -- a cocycle $\hat F \in \mathbf{H}(X,\bar \mathbf{B}U(n))$ in differential [[nonabelian cohomology]] represented by a [[vector bundle]] [[connection on a bundle|with connection]] -- and whose [[action functional]] is 

$$
  \hat F \mapsto
  \int_X F \wedge \star F  + \theta \int_X F \wedge F
$$

for 

* $F$ the [[field strength]], $\mathfrak{u}(n)$-valued [[differential form|differential 2-form]] on $X$ ( with $\mathfrak{u}(n)$ the [[Lie algebra]] of the [[unitary group]] $U(n)$);

* $\star$ the [[Hodge star]] operator;

* $\theta$ some [[real number]].

All gauge fields in the [[standard model of particle physics]] as well as in [[GUT]] models are Yang--Mills fields.

The matter fields in the standard model are spinors charged under the Yang-Mills field. See

* [[spinors in Yang-Mills theory]]
