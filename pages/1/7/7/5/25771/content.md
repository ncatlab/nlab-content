This article is about the twisted tensor product of associative algebras yielding a new algebra containing the original algebras as subalgebras. For another notion of [[twisted tensor product]] of a dg-algebra with a dg-coalgebra yielding a chain complex see there. Both constructions explicitly or implicitly involve additional twisting datum of an appropriate sort. 

## Definition 

This is the definition for the relative case over a possibly noncommutative ring $R$.

$R$-ring $D$ is a twisted tensor product of an $R$-ring $A$ and $R$-ring $B$ if there are $R$-ring morphisms
$i_A:A\to D$ and $i_B:B\to D$ such that he canonical map
$A\otimes_R B\to D$ given by $a\otimes b\mapsto i(a)i(b)$ is an isomorphism of $R$-bimodules. 

## Literature

The present notion is related to factorizations of algebras, hence also to distributive laws in categorical setup.
