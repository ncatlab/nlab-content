A pair $B,N$ of subgroups of a group $G$ is a **BN-pair** if the following holds:

* $B\cup N$ generates $G$,
* $B\cap N$ is a normal subgroup of $N$,
* the group $W:=N/(B\cap N)$ is generated by a set $S$ of involutions,
* for each $s\in S,w\in W$ we have $BsB\cdot BwB\subseteq BswB\cup BwB$
* for $s\in S$, $BsB\cdot BsB\neq B$

Note that the set $S$ is uniquely determined by the axioms, and that $(W,S)$ is a [Coxeter system](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Coxeter+group).
