## Idea
 {#Idea}

Compact ordered spaces can be thought of as a refinement of the notion of [[compact Hausdorff space]] to [[order theory|ordered]] spaces. They share many properties of compact Hausdorff spaces, where equality is replaced by the order relation. 

In particular, these spaces are a convenient choice for notions of [[convergence]] in an [[order theory|ordered]] setting.


## Definition

A **compact ordered space** is a [[compact topological space]] $X$ equipped with a [[partial order]] which is [[closed subset|closed]] as a [[subset]] of $X\times X$.

## Properties

* A compact ordered space is always [[Hausdorff]], i.e. it is a [[compactum]]. To see this, note that since the [[relation]] is a closed subset of $X\times X$, so is the [[opposite relation]], and hence their intersection too, which is the [[diagonal]] of $X\times X$.
