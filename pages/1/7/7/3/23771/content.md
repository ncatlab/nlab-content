## Idea
 {#Idea}

Where the idea of (non-higher) [[observational type theory]] is to equip all [[type formation]] rules (notably [[dependent functions]], [[dependent pairs]] and [[W-types|inductive constructions]]) with their dedicated notion of *structure preserving* [[definitional equality]] --- namely: component-wise, ie. [[homomorphism|homo-morphic]], hence: "observational" ---; the idea of *higher* observational type theory is to do the same for [[propositional equality]] hence for [[identification types]] used in [[homotopy type theory]] (where [[types]] behave like [[homotopy n-type|*higher* homomotopy types]], whence the qualifier "higher").

Concretely:

* the "observational" principle for identification of [[dependent functions]] is to say that these are dependent functions of identifications of arguments and values (a statement otherwise known as [[function extensionality]]),

* the "observational" principle for identifications of [[dependent pairs]] is to say that these are dependent pairs of identifications of factors,

and in ordinary [[univalence axiom|univalent]] [[homotopy type theory]] this form of the "[[structure identity principle]]" follows as a [[type equivalence]] between [[identification types]]:

<img src="/nlab/files/DependentFunctionExtensionality-230121.jpg" width="660">

The idea of higher observational type theory is to make these and analogous structural characterizations of [[identification types]] be part of their definitional [[inference rules]], thus building the [[structure identity principle]] right into the rewrite rules of the type theory.

In such a higher observational theory, in particular also the [[univalence axiom]] would be a [[definitional equality]] and hence would "compute". 

This most desirable property of any [[homotopy type theory]] has previously been accomplished only by [[cubical type theories]].  However, cubical type theories achieve this only by adding syntax for auxiliary/spurious [[interval types]] with rewrite rules which encode technical detail that has no abstract motivation other than making the univalence axiom compute and which one would rather keep out of the syntactic logic and instead relegate to the construction of [[categorical semantics]]. 

The hope is therefore that higher observational type theory would provide a type system which achieves both:

1. its syntax is as logically clean as that of [[Martin-Löf dependent type theory]] equipped with the [[univalence axiom]];

1. its [[inference rules]] for [[identification types]] make the [[univalence axiom]] be a computable function as it is in [[cubical type theories]].

To which extent this hope is being realized would ideally be elucidated by the references [below](#References).



## Details

We are working in a [[dependent type theory]] with [[judgmental equality]]. 

### Telescopes ###

[[telescope types]] contain lists of iteratively dependent terms 

Rules for the empty telescope

$$\frac{}{\epsilon\ \mathrm{tel}}$$

Rules for telescopes given a telescope and a type

$$\frac{\Delta\ \mathrm{tel} \quad \Delta \vdash A \mathrm{type}}{(\Delta,x:A)\ \mathrm{tel}}$$

Rules for the empty context in a telescope

$$\frac{}{():\epsilon}$$

Rules for ...

$$\frac{\delta:\Delta \quad \Delta \vdash A \mathrm{type} \quad a:A[\delta]}{(\delta,a):(\Delta,x:A)}$$

...

$$\frac{\Delta \vdash a:A \quad \delta:\Delta}{a[\delta]:A[\delta]}$$

### Identity telescopes ###

$$\frac{\Delta\ \mathrm{tel} \quad \delta:\Delta \quad \delta^{'}:\Delta}{\delta =_\Delta \delta^{'}\ \mathrm{tel}}$$

...

$$() =_\epsilon () \equiv \epsilon$$

...

$$(\delta,a) =_{\Delta,x:A} (\delta^{'},a^{'}) \equiv \left(\varsigma:\delta =_\Delta \delta^{'}, \alpha:a =_{\Delta.A}^\varsigma a^{'}\right)$$

### Dependent identity types ###

$$\frac{\varsigma:\delta =_\Delta \delta^{'} \quad \delta \vdash A\ \mathrm{type} \quad a:A[\delta] \quad a^{'}:A[\delta^{'}]}{a =_{\Delta.A}^\varsigma a^{'}\ \mathrm{type}}$$

The [[identity types]] in higher observational type theory is defined as 

$$a =_A a^{'} \equiv a =_{\epsilon.A}^{()} a^{'}$$

Computation rules are defined for pair types:

$$(s =_{A \times B}^\varsigma t) \equiv (\pi_1(s) =_A^\varsigma \pi_1(t)) \times (\pi_2(s) =_B^\varsigma \pi_2(t))$$

Computation rules are defined for function types:

$$(f =_{A \to B}^\varsigma g) \equiv \prod_{a:A} \prod_{b:A} \prod_{q:(a =_A b)} (f(a) =_B^\varsigma g(b))$$

Computation rules are defined for dependent function types:

$$(f =_{\prod_{x:A} B(x)}^\varsigma g) \equiv \prod_{a:A} \prod_{b:A} \prod_{p:(a =_{A}^\varsigma b)} (f(a) =_{B}^{\varsigma,p} g(b))$$

Computation rules are defined for dependent pair types:

$$(s =_{\sum_{x:A} B(x)}^\varsigma t) \equiv \sum_{p:(\pi_1(s) =_A^\varsigma \pi_1(t))} (\pi_2(s) =_{B}^{\varsigma,p} \pi_2(t))$$

### Dependent Ap ###

...

### With universes ###

We are working in a [[dependent type theory]] with Tarski-style [[universes]].

The [[identity types]] in a universe in higher observational type theory have the following formation rule:

$$\frac{A:\mathcal{U} \quad a:\mathcal{T}_\mathcal{U}(A) \quad b:\mathcal{T}_\mathcal{U}(A)}{\mathrm{id}_A(a, b):\mathcal{U}}$$

We define a general congruence term called ap

$$\frac{x:A \vdash f:B \quad p:\mathrm{id}_A(a, a^{'})}{\mathrm{ap}_{x.f}(p):\mathrm{id}_B(f[a/x], f[a^{'}/x])}$$

and the reflexivity terms:

$$\frac{a:A}{\mathrm{refl}_{a}:\mathrm{id}_A(a, a)}$$

and computation rules for identity functions

$$\mathrm{ap}_{x.x}(p) \equiv p$$

and for constant functions $y$

$$\mathrm{ap}_{x.y}(p) \equiv \mathrm{refl}_{y}$$

Thus, ap is a higher dimensional explicit substitution. There are definitional equalities

$$\mathrm{ap}_{x.f}(\mathrm{refl}_{a}) \equiv \mathrm{refl}_{f[a/x]}$$

$$\mathrm{ap}_{y.g}(\mathrm{ap}_{x.f}(p)) \equiv \mathrm{ap}_{x.g[f/y]}(p)$$

$$\mathrm{ap}_{x.t}(p) \equiv \mathrm{refl}_{t}$$

for constant term $t$. 

#### Identity types for universes ####

Let $A \cong_\mathcal{U} B$ be the type of [[one-to-one correspondences]] between two terms of a universe $A:\mathcal{U}$ and $B:\mathcal{U}$, and let $\mathrm{id}_\mathcal{U}(A, B)$ be the identity type between two terms of a universe $A:\mathcal{U}$ and $B:\mathcal{U}$. Then there are rules

$$\frac{R:A \cong_\mathcal{U} B}{\Delta(R):\mathrm{id}_\mathcal{U}(A, B)} \qquad \frac{P:\mathrm{id}_\mathcal{U}(A, B)}{\nabla(P):A \cong_\mathcal{U} B} \qquad \frac{R:A \cong_\mathcal{U} B}{\nabla(\Delta(R)) \equiv R}$$

#### Identity types in universes and singleton contractibility ####

Given a term of a universe $A:\mathcal{U}$

$$\mathrm{id}_{\mathcal{T}_\mathcal{U}(A)} \equiv \pi_1(\nabla(\mathrm{refl}_A))$$

with terms representing **singleton contractibility. 

$$\pi_1(\pi_2(\nabla(\mathrm{refl}_A)):\prod_{a:\mathcal{T}_\mathcal{U}(A)} \mathrm{isContr}\left(\sum_{b:\mathcal{T}_\mathcal{U}(A)} \mathrm{id}_{\mathcal{T}_\mathcal{U}(A)}(a, b)\right)$$

$$\pi_2(\pi_2(\nabla(\mathrm{refl}_A))):\prod_{b:\mathcal{T}_\mathcal{U}(A)} \mathrm{isContr}\left(\sum_{a:\mathcal{T}_\mathcal{U}(A)} \mathrm{id}_{\mathcal{T}_\mathcal{U}(A)}(a, b)\right)$$

#### Dependent identity types in universes ####

Given a term of a universe $A:\mathcal{U}$, a judgment $z:\mathcal{T}_\mathcal{U}(A) \vdash B:\mathcal{U}$, terms $x:\mathcal{T}_\mathcal{U}(A)$ and $y:\mathcal{T}_\mathcal{U}(A)$, and an identity $p:\mathrm{id}_{\mathcal{T}_\mathcal{U}(A)}(x,y)$, we have

$$\mathrm{ap}_{z.B}(p):\mathrm{id}_\mathcal{U}(B(x),B(y))$$

and 

$$(u,v):\mathcal{T}_\mathcal{U}(B(x)) \times \mathcal{T}_\mathcal{U}(B(y)) \vdash \pi_1(\nabla(\mathrm{ap}_{z.B}(p)))(u,v):\mathcal{U}$$

We could define a dependent identity type as

$$\mathrm{id}_{\mathcal{T}_\mathcal{U}(z.B)}^{p}(u, v) \coloneqq \pi_1(\nabla(\mathrm{ap}_{z.B}(p)))(u, v)$$

There is a rule

$$\frac{A:\mathcal{U} \quad z:\mathcal{T}_\mathcal{U}(A) \vdash B:\mathcal{U} \quad a:\mathcal{T}_\mathcal{U}(A)}{\mathrm{id}_{\mathcal{T}_\mathcal{U}(z.B)}^{\refl_{a}}(u, v) \equiv \mathrm{id}_{\mathcal{T}_\mathcal{U}(B[a/z])}(u, v)}$$

and for constant families $B:\mathcal{U}$

$$\mathrm{id}_{\mathcal{T}_\mathcal{U}(z.B)}^{p}(u, v) \equiv \mathrm{id}_{\mathcal{T}_\mathcal{U}(B)}(u, v)$$

* [[Thorsten Altenkirch]], [[Yorgo Chamoun]], [[Ambrus Kaposi]], [[Michael Shulman]], *Internal parametricity, without an interval* ([arXiv:2307.06448](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06448))

The authors of the above article write: 

> We presented a type theory with internal parametricity, a presheaf model and a canonicity proof. It can be seen as a baby version of higher observational type theory (HOTT). To obtain HOTT, we plan to add the following additional features to our theory:

> * a bridge type which can be seen as an indexed version of $\forall$,
> * Reedy fibrancy, which replaces spans by relations,
> * a strictification construction which turns the isomorphism for $\Pi$ types into a definitional equality (in case of bridge, we also need the same for $\Sigma$),
> * Kan fibrancy, which adds transport and turns the bridge type into a proper identity type. This would also change the correspondence between $\forall U$ and spans into $\forall U$ and equivalences.
