A vector bundle over a Riemann surface is stable (resp. semistable) if the ratio of its degree and its rank is bigger (resp. bigger or equal) than this ratio for any of its subbundles.

Many references are at [[moduli space of bundles]]. The notion is introduced by [[David Mumford]] in the context of GIT in 1960-s:
