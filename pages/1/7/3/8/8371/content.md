## Idea

A **syllogism** is a pattern of [[deduction|deductive]] argument of a certain limited range of form. The study of syllogisms was originated by [[Aristotle]] and later developed by his followers as well as by the Stoics. Syllogisms were central objects of study for medieval logicians.

Syllogisms involve two premises and a conclusion, each expressing a statement of the form that either all, none or some members of a class do or do not have a certain [[property]]. For example,

* No fish is a mammal.
* Some sea creatures are fish.
* Therefore, some sea creatures are not mammals.

In the nineteenth century, syllogism became seen to be insufficiently expressive as more complicated relations and [[quantification]] were encountered. [[Predicate logic]] came to take its place.
