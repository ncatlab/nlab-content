## Idea

A **syllogism** is a pattern of [[deduction|deductive]] argument of a certain limited range of form. The study of syllogisms was originated by [[Aristotle]] and later developed by his followers as well as by the Stoics. Syllogisms were central objects of study for medieval logicians.

Syllogisms involve two premises and a conclusion, each expressing a statement of the form that either all, none or some members of a class do or do not have a certain [[property]]. For example,

* No fish is a mammal.
* Some sea creatures are fish.
* Therefore, some sea creatures are not mammals.

In the nineteenth century, syllogism became seen to be insufficiently expressive as more complicated relations and [[quantification]] were encountered. [[Predicate logic]] came to take its place.

## Original definition

The definition by Aristotle that has received the most attention (out of several variants) is from _Prior Analytics_ 24b18-22 (here taken from translation by [Striker (2009)](#Striker)):

>A 'syllogismos' is an argument (logos) in which, (i) certain things being posited (tethent&#244;n), (ii) something other than what was laid down (keimen&#244;n) (iii) results by necessity (eks anagk&#234;s sumbainei)(iv) because these things are so. By 'because these things are so' I mean that it results through these, and by 'resulting through these' I mean that no term is required from outside for the necessity to come about.
