A **zero object**, or **null object**, is an [[object]] of a category which is both an [[initial object]] and a [[terminal object]].

The category of [[pointed set|pointed sets]] has a zero object, namely any one-element set.  Likewise, the trivial group is a zero object in the categories of [[group|groups]] and of [[abelian group|abelian groups]].  However, the zero ring is not a zero object in the category of [[ring|rings]], at least as long as rings are required to have units (and ring homomorphisms to preserve them).

In a category with a zero object 0, there is always a canonical morphism from any object $A$ to any other object $B$ called the _zero morphism_, given by the composite $A\to 0 \to B$. Thus, such a category becomes [[enriched category|enriched]] over pointed sets.

Conversely, in any category [[enriched category|enriched]] over pointed sets or abelian groups, any initial _or_ terminal object is automatically a zero object.  This is a special case of a [[Cauchy limit]].
