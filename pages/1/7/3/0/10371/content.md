## Idea

The multiplier algebra $M(A)$ is maximal unital extension of a $C^*$-algebra $A$ which contains $A$ as an [[essential ideal]] (ideal having nonzero intersection with any other proper ideal). In the commutative case, every unital commutative extension in which $A$ is an essential ideal
corresponds to a compactification, $M(A)$ is in that case the 
$C^*$-algebra of functions on a [[Stone-âˆžech compactification]].

## Definition

The __multiplier algebra__ $M(A)$ of a (not necessarily unital) $C^*$-algebra $A$ is the $C^*$-algebra satisfying the following universal property: 
for any $C^*$-algebra $B$ containing $B$ as an ideal, there exists a unique $*$-homomorphism $\phi:B\to M(A)$ such that $\phi$ extends the identity homomorphism on $A$ and 
$\phi(A^\perp)=\{0\}$.

The multiplier algebra $M(A)$ can be realized as the set of 2-sided multipliers in the [[enveloping von Neumann algebra]] of $A$. If $A\subset B$, $b\in B$ is a multiplier (operator) for $A$ if $\forall a\in A$, $b a\in A$ and $a b\in A$.

## Related concepts

There are also larger [[local multiplier algebra]]s $M_{loc}(A)$.

> We show that the multipliers of Pedersen's ideal of a $C^*$-algebra $A$ correspond to the densely defined operators on $A$ which are affiliated with $A$ in the sense defined by Woronowicz, and whose domains contain Pedersen's ideal. We also extend the theory of q-continuity developed by Akemann to unbounded operators and show that these operators correspond to self-adjoint operators affiliated with $A$.
