## Idea

The *Born rule* is the core statement of [[coordination]] in the foundations of [[quantum physics]]: 

In its version for [[pure states]] the Born rule says that 

* for $A$ an [[observable]] in the form of a [[Hermitean operator]] on the given [[Hilbert space]] $\mathcal{H}$ of [[pure state|pure]] [[quantum states]], 

* $P$ denoting the [[projection operator]] on a give [[eigenvector|eigenstate]] of this operator, 

* $\pi \,\in\, \mathcal{H}$ a [[pure state]]; 

then the [[probability]] of observing the given eigenstate in a [[quantum system]] which is in state $\psi$ equals

$$
  \frac{
    \langle \psi \vert P \vert \psi \rangle
  }{
    \langle \psi \vert \psi \rangle
  }
$$
