## Idea

As a model for an [[(âˆž,1)-category]] a [[simplicially enriched category]] may be thought of as a [[semi-strict infinity-category|semi-strictification]] of a [[quasi-category]]: composition along 0-cells is strictly associative and unital.

The [[quasi-category]] corresponding to a simplicial category $C$ is its
[[homotopy coherent nerve]] $N$

$$
  sSet Cat \stackrel{\overset{|-|}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{N}{\to}} sSet
  \,.
$$

## Relations

* For $C$ any [[SSet]]-[[enriched category]], the canonical morphism

  $$ 
    |N(C)| \to C
  $$

  is an equivalence in that it is essentially surjective on the underlying homotopyy categories and a weak eqivalence of simplicial sets hom-wise (...details/links...)

  For $S$ any [[simplicial set]], the canonical morphism

  $$
    S \to N(|S|)
  $$

  is a [[model structure for quasi-categories|categorical equivalence]] of simplicial sets.

## Model category structures

The above relations constitute arrange into a [[Quillen equivalence]] between [[model category]] structures on quasicategories and simplicially enriched categories.

There is the 

* [[model structure for quasi-categories]]

* [[model structure on sSet-categories]].

The [[homotopy coherent nerve]] 

$$
  sSet Cat \stackrel{N}{\to} sSet_{Joyal}
$$

is the [[right adjoint]] part of a [[Quillen equivalence]] between these model structures.

## References

The [[homotopy coherent nerve]] is an old idea. See there for references.
