## Idea

As a model for an [[(∞,1)-category]] a [[simplicially enriched category]] may be thought of as a [[semi-strict infinity-category|semi-strictification]] of a [[quasi-category]]: composition along 0-cells is strictly associative and unital.

The [[quasi-category]] corresponding to a simplicial category $C$ is its
[[homotopy coherent nerve]] $N$

$$
  sSet Cat \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\underset{N}{\to}} sSet
  \,.
$$

## Model category structures

There is the 

* [[model structure for quasi-categories]]

* [[model structure on sSet-categories]].

The [[homotopy coherent nerve]] 

$$
  sSet Cat \stackrel{N}{\to} sSet_{Joyal}
$$

is the [[right adjoint]] part of a [[Quillen equivalence]] between these model structures.

## References

The [[homotopy coherent nerve]] is an old idea. See there for references.

The [[Quillen equivalence]] between the [[model structure for quasi-categories]] and the [[model structure on sSet-categories]] is described in
