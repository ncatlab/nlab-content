## Idea

As a model for an [[(∞,1)-category]] a [[simplicially enriched category]] may be thought of as a [[semi-strict infinity-category|semi-strictification]] of a [[quasi-category]]: composition along 0-cells is strictly associative and unital.

## The Quillen equivalence between the Joyal model structure and the Dwyer–Kan–Bergner model structure

Our notation follows ([Bergner](#Bergner)).

There is a [[Quillen equivalence]] (due to Joyal (unpublished) and Lurie)
$$SC \stackrel{\overset{\mathfrak{C}}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\tilde N}{\to}} sSet.$$

Here $SC$ is the model category of [[simplicial categories]]
equipped with the [[Dwyer–Kan–Bergner model structure]]
and $sSet$ denotes the [[Joyal model structure]] on [[simplicial sets]].

The functor $\tilde N$ is the [[homotopy coherent nerve]] functor.
The functor $\mathfrak{C}$ is its [[left adjoint functor]].

In particular, for $C$ a fibrant [[SSet]]-[[enriched category]], the canonical morphism
$$\mathfrak{C}(\tilde N(C)) \to C$$
given by the [[counit]] of the above adjunction
is derived, hence a [[Dwyer–Kan weak equivalence]] of [[simplicial categories]].

For $S$ any [[simplicial set]], the canonical morphism
$$S \to \tilde N(R(\mathfrak{C}(S)))$$
is a [[model structure for quasi-categories|categorical equivalence]] of simplicial sets,
where $R$ denotes the [[fibrant replacement]] functor in the [[Dwyer–Kan–Bergner model structure]].

or [Dugger–Spivak](#DuggerSpivak.Rigidification), or [Dugger-Spivak](#DuggerSpivak.Mapping).


## Relations

### Via $\bar W$-construction

We have an evident inclusion 
$$sSet Cat \hookrightarrow Cat^{\Delta}$$
of [[simplicially enriched categories]]
into [[simplicial objects in Cat]].

On the latter the $\bar W$-functor is defined as the composite
$$
  \bar W 
   \colon
  Cat^\Delta
   \stackrel{N^\Delta}{\to}
  sSet^\Delta
   \stackrel{}{\to}
  sSet
$$
where first we degreewise form the ordinary [[nerve]] of categories and then take the total simplicial set of [[bisimplicial sets]] (the [[right adjoint]] of pullback along the [[diagonal]] $\Delta^n \to \Delta^n \times \Delta^n$).

###### Proposition

For $C$ a [[simplicial groupoid]] there is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]]
$$\mathcal{N}(C) \to \bar W(C)$$
from the [[homotopy coherent nerve]]

## References

The idea of a [[homotopy coherent nerve]] has been around for some time.  It was first  made explicit by [[Cordier]] in 1980, and the link with quasi-categories was then used in his joint work  with [[Tim Porter|Porter]]. That work owed a lot to earlier ideas of  [[Michael Boardman|Boardman]] and [[Rainer Vogt|Vogt]] about seven years earlier who had used a more topologically based approach.  Precise references are given and the history discussed more fully at the entry, [[homotopy coherent nerve]].
