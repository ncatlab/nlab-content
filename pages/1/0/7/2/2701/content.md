The **MacNeille** [[completion]] of a [[lattice]] $L$ is a complete lattice $C$ containing $L$, with $L$ both join-dense and meet-dense in $C$ (that is, each element of $C$ is both a join of elements of $L$ and a meet of elements of $L$), and such that if $C'$ is another such lattice then there is a unique isomorphism from $C$ to $C'$ fixing $L$.

A MacNeille completion may also be defined for a [[poset]]. Let $P(M)$ be the set of all subsets of $M$, ordered by inclusion. For any $X \in P(M)$ assume that

* $X^{\Delta} = \{\alpha \in M: \alpha \geq x for all x \in X\}$

* $X^{\nabla} = \{\alpha \in M: \alpha \leq x for all x \in X\}$

The condition $\phi(X) = (X^{\Delta})^{\nabla}$ defines a [[Moore closure|closure]] operation $\phi$ on $P(M)$. The lattice $L$ of all $\phi$-closed subsets of $M$ is complete. For any $x \in M$ the set $i(x) = (\{x\}^{\Delta})^{\nabla}$ is the principal ideal generated by $x$. Then $i$ is an isomorphic embedding of $M$ into the complete lattice $L$ that preserves all least upper bounds and greatest lower bounds existing in $M$. When applied to the ordered set of rational numbers, the construction described above gives the completion of the set of rational numbers by Dedekind sections.
