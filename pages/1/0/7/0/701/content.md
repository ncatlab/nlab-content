A [[morphism]] $e:B\to B$ in a [[category]] is an **idempotent** if $e e = e$.

A **splitting** of an idempotent $e$ consists of morphisms $i:A\to B$ and $r:B\to A$ such that $r i= 1_A$ and $i r = e$.  In this case $A$ is a [[retract]] of $B$.

The splitting of an idempotent $e$ is both the [[limit]] and the [[colimit]] of the diagram containing only $e$.  Splittings of idempotents are preserved by any functor, making them [[absolute colimit|absolute]] (co)limits.  In ordinary (i.e. [[enriched category|unenriched]]) categories, every absolute (co)limit can be constructed from split idempotents.  Thus, the [[Cauchy complete category|Cauchy completion]] of an ordinary category is just its completion under split idempotents.
