##Idea

An **effect handler** is an interpretation of the [[algebraic effects]] of a computation.

> Conceptually, algebraic operations and effect handlers are dual: the former could be called effect _constructors_ as they give rise to the effects; the latter could be called effect _deconstructors_ as the computations they provide proceed according to the effects already
created. ([PlotPret13](#PlotPret13))

Handlers have also been defined ([Lindley14](#Lindley14)) for more general effects, such as [[applicative functors]] and [[arrow (in computer science)|arrows]] (or idioms).
