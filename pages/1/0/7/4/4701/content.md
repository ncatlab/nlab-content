_Jonathan M. Rosenberg_ is a mathematician working on [[noncommutative geometry]], [[algebraic K-theory]], [[operator algebras]] and applications to [[string theory]] ([[D-brane charge]], [[T-duality]], [[orientifolds]]).

He is an editor of the [Journal of K-theory](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-k-theory).
