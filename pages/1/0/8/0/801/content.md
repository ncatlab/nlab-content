A **homotopy type** is a term for a [[topological space]] considered up to [[weak homotopy equivalence]].  By standard theorems, homotopy types can also be modeled by many other structures, such as

* [[simplicial set]]s up to weak homotopy equivalence
* small [[category|categories]] up to weak homotopy equivalence of their nerves
* $\infty$-[[infinity-groupoid|groupoids]] up to category-theoretic [[equivalence of categories|equivalence]] (this is the content of the [[homotopy hypothesis]]).

In most cases the tools of [[homotopy theory]], in particular [[model category|model categories]], can be used to establish these equivalences.
