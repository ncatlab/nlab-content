The term _spin connection_ is traditionally used in [[physics]] -- for instance in [[first-order formulation of gravity]] -- to denote a [[connection on a bundle|connection]] on the [[tangent bundle]] of a [[manifold]] with [[spin structure]] given as a [[special orthogonal Lie algebra]]-valued connection on the underlying [[special orthogonal group]]-[[principal bundle]]. The term is mainly used to distinguish from the the connection expressed in [[Christoffel symbol]]s.  Since for this connection alone the [[spin structure]] is not important, the term _spin connection_ is often used for $\mathfrak{so}$-connecition on any orientable manifold.
