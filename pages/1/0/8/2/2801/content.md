The __spectral theorems__ form a cornerstone of [[functional analysis]]. They are a vast generalization to infinite-dimensional [[Hilbert spaces]] of a basic result in linear algebra: an $n \times n$ Hermitian matrix can be diagonalized or conjugated to a diagonal matrix with real entries along the diagonal.
