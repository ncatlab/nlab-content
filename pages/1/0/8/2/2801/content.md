The spectral theorem is a rubric for a collection of theorems which form a cornerstone of functional analysis. It is a vast generalization to infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces of a basic result in linear algebra: an $n \times n$ Hermitian matrix can be diagonalized or conjugated to a diagonal matrix with real entries along the diagonal.
