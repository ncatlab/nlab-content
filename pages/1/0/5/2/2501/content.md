## Idea

Ordinary [[classical mechanics]] of point particles may be regarded as the theory of [[action functional]]s on [[mapping space]]s of maps from the real line to some space.

In _classical [[field theory]]_ one instead studies functionals on [[mapping space]]s on higher dimensional domains.


### Classical gauge theory ##

Of particular interest are classical field theories that are [[gauge theory|gauge theories]]. A powerful formalism for handling these is provided by [[BV theory]], which effectively realizes spaces of classical fields as [[Lie infinity-algebroid|âˆž-Lie algebroid]]s. BV-formalism can be understood as a means to capture a classical gauge field theory in such a way that it lends itself to [[quantization]]. (See below)


## Examples 

Important examples of classical field theories are

* [[electromagnetism]]

* [[gravity]], [[supergravity]]


## Quantization of classical field theory

When it was realized that fundamental physics is governed by [[quantum field theory]] it became clear that classical field theory of fundamental fields can only be an approximation to the corresponding [[quantum field theory]]. If we think of quantum field theory in terms of [[FQFT|functorial quantum field theory]], then the domains of the mapping spaces mentioned above are the [[cobordism]]s that this [[FQFT]] is a functor on. The [[quantization]] of classical field theories to [[quantum field theories]] is a major issue in theoretical and mathematical [[physics]] (see also [[renormalization]] and [[geometric quantization]]).
