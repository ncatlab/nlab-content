#Idea#

Ordinary [[classical mechanics]] of point particles may be regarded as the theory of [[action functional]]s on [[mapping space]]s of maps from the real line to some space.

In _classical [[field theory]]_ one instead studies functionals on [[mapping space]]s on higher dimensional domains.


## classical gauge theory ##

Of particular interest are classical field theories that are [[gauge theory|gauge theories]]. A powerful formalism for handling these is provided by [[BV theory]], which effectively realizes spaces of classical fields as [[Lie infinity-algebroid|âˆž-Lie algebroid]]s. BV-formalism can be understood as a means to capture a classical gauge field theory in such a way that it lends itself to [[quantization]]. (See below)


## examples ##

Important examples of classical field theories are

* [[electromagnetism]]

* [[gravity]], [[supergravity]]

[[Ian Durham]]: I've never heard of supergravity as being considered a _classical_ theory before.  Isn't the spin structure it is imbued with inherently quantum mechanical in nature?  I've never even seen it in anything other than a quantum field theory book (i.e. I've never seen it in a GR or GR-related book)?

Zoran: criterium on which book is irrelevant. It is easy to see in any treatment, that one has a classical version first and then quantization.

## quantizaton of classical field theory ##

When it was realized that fundamental physics is governed by [[quantum field theory]] it became clear that classical field theory of fundamental fields can only be an approximation to the corresponginf [[quantum field theory]]. If we think of quantum field theory in terms of [[FQFT|functorial quantum field theory]], then the domains of the mapping spaces mentionmed above are the [[cobordism]]s that this [[FQFT]] is a functor on. The [[quantization]] of classical field theories to [[quantum field theories]] is a major issue in theoretical and mathematical [[physics]] (see also [[renormalization]]).
