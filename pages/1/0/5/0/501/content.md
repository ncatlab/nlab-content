A **finite set** is a set $A$ for which there exists a [[bijection]] between $A$ and the set $\{k\in N | k\lt n\}$ for some $n\in N$, where $N$ is the natural numbers.

Classically, the finite sets are the [[finitely presentable object|finitely presentable objects]] in [[Set]].

## Finiteness in constructive mathematics ##

In [[constructivism|constructive mathematics]] (and, thus, internally to a [[topos]]) a number of classically equivalent notions of finiteness become distinguishable.  In addition to the above notion (for which one generally reserves "finite"), we have the following.

* A set is **subfinite** if it admits an injection into some finite set.

* A set is **finitely indexed** (also called **Kuratowski-finite**, **K-finite**, or even sometimes, confusingly, _subfinite_) if it is a surjective image of some finite set.

* A set is **subfinitely indexed** (also called **$\tilde{K}$-finite**) if it admits a surjection from a subfinite set, or equivalently admits an injection to a finitely indexed set; that is, it is a [[subquotient]] of a finite set.

Finite sets are always [[projective object|projective]]; that is, the "finite [[axiom of choice]]" always holds.  However, if any finite set greater than 1 is [[choice object|choice]], or if every 2-indexed set is projective, then the logic must be classical (see [[excluded middle]] for a proof).

* A set is **Dedekind-finite** if any injection from it to itself must be a bijection.  In contrast to the previous three notions, Dedekind-finite infinite sets can coexist with [[excluded middle|PEM]], although [[countable choice]] suffices to banish them.

All of these definitions can be phrased to make sense even without an axiom of infinity (and thus in a topos without a [[natural numbers object]]).  Basically, you define (for a given set $S$) the concept of 'collection of subsets of $S$ that includes all of the finite subsets' by requiring it to be closed under inductive operations appropriate for the sense of 'finite' that you want; then $S$ is finite if and only if it is an element of all such collections.

* For "finitely-indexed," we define $K(S)$ to be the smallest subset of $P(S)$ containing the [[empty set]] and all singletons and closed under binary union.  Then $S$ is finitely-indexed iff $S\in K(S)$, and iff $K(S)$ has a top element.  (But even then $K(S)$ need not be all of $P(S)$, since a subset of a finitely-indexed set need not be finitely-indexed.)  $K(S)$ can also be defined more [[predicativism|predicatively]] as the free [[semilattice]] generated by $S$.

* For "subfinitely-indexed" we define $\tilde{K}(S)$ to be the smallest subset of $P(S)$ containing all [[subsingleton|subsingletons]] and closed under binary join.  Then $S$ is subfinitely-indexed iff $S\in \tilde{K}(S)$, which in this case is equivalent to $\tilde{K}(S)=P(S)$.

Challenge: Can you think of a way to define it [[predicativism|predicatively]]?

Yes for finitely-indexed, as above, at least if you're willing to admit W-type-like things as predicative.  Don't know about the others.  Actually, I don't even know how to define "finite" or "subfinite" in a topos without an NNO.
