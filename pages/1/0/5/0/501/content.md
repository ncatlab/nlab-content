A **finite set** is a set $A$ for which there exists a [[bijection]] between $A$ and the set $\{k\in N | k\lt n\}$ for some $n\in N$, where $N$ is the natural numbers.

Classically, the finite sets are the [[finitely presentable object|finitely presentable objects]] in [[Set]].

## Finiteness in constructive mathematics ##

Classically, there is not much more to say about finite sets from a categorical point of view, although of course the entire subject of combinatorics is about finite sets.  In [[constructivism|constructive mathematics]], however (and, thus, internally to a [[topos]]), a number of classically equivalent notions of finiteness become distinguishable.  In addition to the above notion (for which one generally reserves "finite"), we have the following.

* A set is **subfinite** if it admits an injection into some finite set.

* A set is **finitely indexed** (also called **Kuratowski-finite**, **K-finite**, or even sometimes, confusingly, _subfinite_) if it is a surjective image of some finite set.  In many cases one is especially interested in finitely indexed sets which are also [[decidable object|decidable]] for reasons mentioned below.

* A set is **subfinitely indexed** (also called **$\tilde{K}$-finite**) if it admits a surjection from a subfinite set, or equivalently admits an injection to a finitely indexed set; that is, it is a [[subquotient]] of a finite set.

Finite sets are always [[projective object|projective]]; that is, the "finite [[axiom of choice]]" always holds.  However, if any finite set greater than 1 is [[choice object|choice]], or if every 2-indexed set is projective, then the logic must be classical (see [[excluded middle]] for a proof).

* A set is **Dedekind-finite** if any injection from it to itself must be a bijection.  In contrast to the previous three notions, Dedekind-finite infinite sets can coexist with [[excluded middle|PEM]], although [[countable choice]] suffices to banish them.

### Finiteness without infinity

The above definition of "finite," and hence all the above definitions except for Dedekind-finiteness, only make sense given the set of natural numbers, i.e. given an axiom of infinity.  However, they can  all be rephrased to make sense even without an axiom of infinity (and thus in a topos without a [[natural numbers object]]).  Basically, you define (for a given set $S$) the concept of 'collection of subsets of $S$ that includes all of the finite subsets' by requiring it to be closed under inductive operations appropriate for the sense of 'finite' that you want; then $S$ is finite if and only if it is an element of all such collections.  Namely, for any set $S$ we define the following subsets of $P(S)$.

* $K(S)$ is the smallest subset of $P(S)$ containing the empty set and closed under the operation $A \mapsto A \cup B$ for $A$ a subset of $S$ and $B$ a singleton in $S$.  Then $S$ is finitely-indexed iff $S\in K(S)$.  Note that $K(S)$ is also the free [[semilattice]] generated by $S$.
* $\tilde{K}(S)$ is the smallest subset of $P(S)$ containing the empty set and closed under the operation $A \mapsto A \cup B$ for $A$ a subset of $S$ and $B$ a subsingleton in $S$.  Then $S$ is subfinitely-indexed iff $S\in \tilde{K}(S)$.
* $F(S)$ is the smallest subset of $P(S)$ containing the empty set and closed under the operation $A \mapsto A \cup B$ for $A$ a subset of $S$ and $B$ a singleton in $S$ disjoint from $A$.  Then $S$ is finite iff $S\in F(S)$.
* $\tilde{F}(S)$ is the smallest subset of $P(S)$ containing the empty set and closed under the operation $A \mapsto A \cup B$ for $A$ a subset of $S$ and $B$ a subsingleton in $S$ disjoint from $A$.  Then $S$ is subfinite iff $S\in \tilde{F}(S)$.

### Challenge

_Toby_: Can you think of a way to define these notions of finite [[predicativism|predicatively]] and without an NNO?

### Finite objects in a topos

In a topos, we say that an object has one of the above finiteness properties if it does so in the internal logic of the topos.  In this case, it is traditional to say "finite cardinal" instead of "finite." Note that because of how the internal logic works, a K-finite object is only _locally_ a quotient of a finite cardinal, and likewise a $\tilde{K}$-finite object is only locally a subobject of a K-finite object.

In any topos, the subcategory of finite cardinals is again a topos, and it is [[Boolean topos|Boolean]].  Its [[subobject classifier]] is $2=1\sqcup 1$, which in the ambient topos is the classifier only of [[decidable object|decidable]] subobjects.  This means that classically valid arguments, including all of finitary combinatorics, can generally be applied easily to finite cardinals, as long as we always interpret "subset" to mean "decidable subset."

The other notions of "finite object" need not, in general, form toposes.  However, the category of decidable K-finite objects is always a Boolean topos, again with $2$ as its subobject classifier.  So topos theory suggests that "decidable K-finite set" is another good constructive notion of "finite set;" see also the examples below.  The category of K-finite objects is a topos iff every K-finite object is decidable, while the category of $\tilde{K}$-finite objects is a topos if (but not only if) the subobject classifier is K-finite.

### Examples

* In the topos [[Set]], as usually conceived, all notions of finiteness coincide.

* In a [[presheaf]] topos $[C^{op},Set]$, the finite cardinals are the finite-set-valued functors which are constant on each connected component.  In particular, if $C$ is a [[group]], then the topos of finite cardinals is equivalent to $FinSet$.

* Likewise, in the topos $Sh(X)$ of [[sheaf|sheaves]] on a space $X$, the finite cardinals are the locally constant functions $X\to N$.  So if $X$ is connected, the topos of finite cardinals in $Sh(X)$ is also equivalent to $FinSet$.

* By contrast, the K-finite objects in $[C^{op},Set]$ are the finite-set-valued functors each of whose transition functions is surjective, and the _decidable_ K-finite objects are the finite-set-valued functors each of whose transition functions is bijective.

* In particular, if $C$ is a groupoid, the topos of decidable K-finite objects is equivalent to $[C^{op},FinSet]$.  Since the topos of presheaves on a groupoid is Boolean, it is possible for the finite cardinals and the K-finite objects to fail to coincide in a Boolean topos.  (However, it is still true in the [[internal logic]] of any Boolean topos that "every K-finite object is finite.")

* In $Sh(X)$, the decidable K-finite objects are those that are "locally finite;" i.e. there is an open cover of $X$ such that over each open in the cover, the sheaf is a locally constant function to $N$.  These are essentially the same as [[covering space|covering spaces]] of $X$.
