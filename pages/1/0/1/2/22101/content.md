## Idea

The _quaternionic projective plane_ $\mathbb{H}P^2$ is the [[projective plane]] over the [[skew-field]] of [[quaternions]], hence the quaternionic 2-dimensional [[quaternionic projective space]].

## Properties

### Cell structure

See at *[[cell structure of projective spaces]]*.


### As a quaternion-Kähler manifold / Wolf space

The quaternionic projective plane $\mathbb{H}P^2$ the first of the list of examples  of spaces that are both [[quaternion-Kähler manifolds]] as well as [[symmetric spaces]], called _[[Wolf spaces]]_.


### AKM-Theorem

In higher dimensional analogy to the [[Arnold-Kuiper-Massey theorem]] identifying the [[quotient space|quotient]] of the [[complex projective plane]] by its [[finite group of order 2|O(1)]]-action as the [[4-sphere]], we have:

###### Proposition
**(quaternionic [[AKM-theorem]])**

The [[7-sphere]] is the [[quotient space]] of the (right-)[[quaternionic projective plane]] by the left multiplication [[action]] by [[U(1)]] $\subset$ [[Sp(1)]]:
