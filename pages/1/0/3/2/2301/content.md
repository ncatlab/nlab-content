The notion of  _generalized scheme_ or _$G$-scheme_ is the generalization of the notion of [[scheme]] from [[algebraic geometry]] to [[geometry]] more generaly and from [[geometry]] to [[higher geometry]]. In particular it yields a generalization of [[scheme]] to the context of [[derived algebraic geometry]] but also for instance a generalization of the notion of [[manifold|smooth manifold]] to [[derived smooth manifold]].

Recall that one way to define a [[scheme]] is as a [[ringed space]], namely as a [[topological space]] $X$ with a special [[ring]]-valued [[sheaf]] $O \in Sh(X,Rings)$ on (the [[category of open subsets]] of) $X$ singled out: the _structure sheaf_ that assigns to a subset $U \subset X$ the [[ring]] of _admissable functions_ on $U$.

Using the [[category theory|general nonsense]] of [[space and quantity]] one may regard a ring-valued sheaf on $X$ as a sheaves-of-sets-valued presheaf on rings, i.e. as a functor  $O : Rings^{op} \to Sh(X,Set)$ =: Sh(X). 

This is useful because $Sh(X)$ is a [[topos]] (a [[Grothendieck topos]]) and as such has a good theory for higher generalizations in [[higher topos theory]]: to every [[topological space]] $X$ we have not just the 1-[[topos]] of [[sheaf|sheaves]], but also the [[(infinity,1)-category of (infinity,1)-sheaves|(infinity,1)-topos of (infinity,1)-sheaves]] (often called [[infinity-stack]]s).

A **generalized scheme** is essentially a [[topological space]] $X$ together with a prescribed functor
