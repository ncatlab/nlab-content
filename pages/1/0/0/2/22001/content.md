## Idea

__Picard-Vessiot theory__ is the [[Galois theory]] of homogeneous linear [[ordinary differential equations]]. A version for homogeneous linear difference equations has also been developed. Alternatively, terms differential Galois theory and difference Galois theory have also been used.

> ...Hopf algebraic approach simplifies and generalizes the theory. Among other things the generalization gives a Picard-Vessiot theory for positive characteristic, for fields with not necessarily commuting derivations, and even for fields with (a set of) higher derivations.
