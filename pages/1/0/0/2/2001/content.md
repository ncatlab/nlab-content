## Definition

A [[homomorphism]] of (not necessarily commutative nor unital) [[rings]] $u:R\to S$ is __flat__ if the [[extension of scalars]] (= [[inverse image]]) [[functor]] $u^*:{}_R Mod\to {}_S Mod$, $M\mapsto S\otimes_R M$ is an [[exact functor|exact]] [[additive functor]]. 

Recall that every [[extension of scalars]] functor for [[modules]] is cocontinuous and a fortiori admits a [[right adjoint]]. Hence this definition is in an agreement with the more general notion of a [[flat functor]] in category and topos theory.

If one pictures a morphism as a family over its [[codomain]], then for many purposes good families are flat (e.g. in [[deformation theory]]). 



**Flat modules:** A right $R$-module $M_R$ is **flat** if the functor ${}_R N\mapsto M \otimes_R N$ from the category of left $R$-modules to the category [[Ab]] of abelian groups is exact. 

A morphism $f:X\to Y$ of [[schemes]] is **flat** if the induced map on [[stalks]] is a flat morphism of (commutative unital) rings. 

A morphism of schemes is **faithfully flat** if it is flat and [[epimorphism|epi]]. 

A morphism of [[affine schemes]] $Spec(B) \to Spec(A)$, hence coming from a [[ring]] [[homomorphism]] $f \colon A \to B$ is

* flat precisely if $f$ exhibits $B$ as a [[flat module]] over $A$;

* faithfully flat if $f$ exhibits $B$ as a [[faithfully flat module]] over $A$.

###### Proposition

A flat morphism $Spec(B) \to Spec(A)$ is faithfully flat if it is an [[epimorphism]].

## Flat topologies

Given a base scheme $S$, the [[slice category]] $Sch/S$ of [[relative schemes]] over $S$ is equipped with several _flat [[Grothendieck topologies]]_. 

These are the [[Grothendieck topologies]] in which covers consist of flat morphisms which set-theoretically cover the target scheme with some additional finiteness conditions. The usual choices are the [[fppf topology|fppf]] (fr. _fid&#232;lement plat de presentation finie_, 'faithfully flat and of finite presentation') and [[fpqc topology|fpqc]] (fr. _fid&#232;lement plat et quasicompact_, 'faithfully flat and quasicompact') topologies.
