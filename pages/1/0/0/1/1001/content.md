In the terminology of [[Nikolai Durov]], a __generalized ring__ is an [[algebraic monad|algebraic (i.e. finitary) monad]] that is [[commutative monad|commutative]]. 

Durov introduced [[spectrum (geometry)|spectra]] of generalized rings, generalizing the Grothendieck [[prime spectrum]]. This enabled him to develop _generalized algebraic geometry_, a single framework whose special cases include versions of [[tropical geometry]], [[Arakelov geometry]] and [[absolute geometry]] over $F_1$. The categories of [[quasicoherent sheaf|quasicoherent sheaves]] in that setup are not necessarily [[abelian category|abelian]]; for that reason, Durov develops a version of [[homotopical algebra]] in a [[topos]], to be able to replace the usual [[homological algebra]] for abelian sheaves with nonabelian derived functors following Quillen. In his version of homotopical algebra, [[model categories]] are however replaced by [[pseudomodel stacks]]. The ultimate goal is to set a natural framework for a statement and proof of the arithmetic Riemann--Roch theorem of Bismut--Gillet--Soul&#233; and Faltings in a manner parallel to the Grothendieck--Riemann--Roch theorem.
