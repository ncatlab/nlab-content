## Definition

A _cosimplicial simplicial set_ is a [[cosimplicial object]] in the category of [[simplicial set]]s, hence a [[functor]]

$$
  \Delta \to sSet
$$

which equivalently is a functor

$$
  \Delta \times \Delta^{op} \to Set
  \,.
$$

There is an evident [[model category]] structure on $sSet^{\Delta}$ which models cosimplicial [[infinity groupoid]]s.

## Properties

### Model structure

There are several standard ways to equip $sSet^\Delta$ with the structure of a [[model category]]. See _[[model structure on cosimplicial simplicial sets]]_ for more.


### Homotopy and homology

The [[homotopy groups]] of the [[totalization]] of a cosimplicial homotopy type are computed by a [[Bousfield-Kan spectral sequence]]. The [[homology groups]] by an [[Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence]].
