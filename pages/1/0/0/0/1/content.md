Welcome.

This is a joint collaborative laboratory dealing with $n$-dimensional _Mathematics_, _Physics_ and _Philosophy_.  It has grown out of and is attached to the
<a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/"><i>n</i>-Category Caf&eacute;</a>. You come here to work and go there to chat.

We are hoping, by collaborative effort, to create here a space for presentation and archival storage of joint collaborative work of encyclopedic, didactic, expositional,  but also original nature, such as, but not exclusively, is being discussed every day on the $n$-Caf&eacute;.

But this site has only just started operation and we are still  trying to organize ourselves and get properly started. All help is appreciated.
