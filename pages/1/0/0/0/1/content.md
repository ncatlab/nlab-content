Welcome!

This is a lab for collaborative work on _Mathematics_, _Physics_ and _Philosophy_ &mdash; especially insofar as these subjects touch on <i>n</i>-categories and related 'higher algebraic structures'.  

In other words: this place is like the library, or alchemist's laboratory, in the back room of the
<a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/"><i>n</i>-Category Caf&eacute;</a>. You come here to work and go there to chat.

We are hoping to create here a space for presentation and archival storage of collaborative work of encyclopedic, didactic, expositional,  but also original nature.  This will include, but not be limited to, the subjects being discussed every day in the $n$-Caf&eacute;.

But this site has only just started operation.   We are still trying to get it organized.  Your help is appreciated! 

* See the [[HowTo]]-page to get started

* Go to the [[General Discussion]] page to discuss ideas on how the $n$Lab should work.
