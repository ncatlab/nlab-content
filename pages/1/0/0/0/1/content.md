I lost the password for my old web, namely http://ncatlab.org/baez/, when my old laptop died!  If anyone can help me delete that one, please do.

My main project here is to write a paper on algebraic geometry with [[James Dolan:homepage]]:

This is the Lab Elves' testing ground.
Nothing here is intended to be of any use to anyone else, though it may be made public for testing purposes.

Here's testing page capitalisation: [[Page One]] and [[page one]] will create two different pages.  Can we get to them both?  Can we also get [[Page Two]] and [[page two]]?  Yup, that all works as expected.

This web is for [[nlab:Andrew Stacey|me]] to make notes on papers that I read.  It's public (meaning that anyone can read and edit entries) because I can't think of any reason why it shouldn't be; however, if editing an entry please respect the fact that this is a _personal_ web and that many things written will be my personal opinion.

The **Proceedings of the $n$Lab** is an web-based journal for peer-reviewed publication of original research and expository writing on topics in mathematics and mathematical physics that are usefully discussed from the [[nLab:nPOV|point of view]] of [[nLab:category theory]] and [[nLab:higher category theory]].

#Contents#
* table of contents
{:toc}

## Format

The _Proceedings of the $n$Lab_ appears in the same Wiki-format as the [[nLab:HomePage|nLab]] in a way that facilitates thorough cross-hyperlinking. This allows _Proceeding_-articles to conveniently refer their readers to background material on the $n$Lab and allows $n$Lab-articles to point their readers to stable and peer-reviewed results and proofs in the _Proceedings_ .


## Editorial board {#EditorialBoard}

At the moment the _Proceedings of the $n$Lab_ are in the developmental phase and a formal editorial board is yet to be set up. For the time being the [[nlabmeta:steering committee|nLab steering committe]] is the closest formal body responsible for the _Proceedings_ . A primordial editorial board should be formed soon.

## Submission procedure

An author who wishes to submit any material for publication to the _Proceedings of the $n$Lab_ should go through the following steps.

1. Create the material to be submitted in separate pages on the [[nLab:HomePage|nLab]] the way any $n$Lab pages are created (see [[nLab:HowTo|nLab HowTo]] for details). 

1. Notify the [editorial board of the Proceedings](#EditorialBoard) about which pages in which precise version (as given in the edit-history of the entry) are to be submitted. 

   (The precise version datum is mandatory for a submission to peer-review, as $n$Lab entries are subject to potential perpetual edits.)

The submitted material will go through a refereeing process as usual in mathematical journals. If the material is accepted, publication of the material proceeds as follows:

1. The accepted version of the $n$Lab entries is copied over to the write-protected _Proceedigs_ web. (The $n$Lab version of the submiited material remains in place, but is subject to perpetual further edits, as all material on the $n$Lab is.)

1. Hyperlinks are added to the $n$Lab version of the submitted article, pointing to the stable peer-reviewed version published in the _Proceedings_ . Conversely, the Proceedings-version is equipped with a link back to the freely editable $n$Lab version.

This web mirrors some versions of some articles of the [[nLab:HomePage|nLab]]: those that have received some kind of official peer-review and have been labeled _reliable_ by some referees. 

The precise nature of the refereeing that any page has received is indicated on the page.

### Researchers

#### Tenured staff

* [Ieke Moerdijk](http://www.math.uu.nl/people/moerdijk)

  Moerdijk's interests lie in algebraic and differential topology, and in applications of topology to logic. Recently, he has worked on Lie groupoids and algebroids with Crainic and Mrcun, and on operads and model categories with Berger. Currently, in collaboration with Berger, Cisinski and Weiss, he is trying to develop the theory of dendroidal sets (an extension of simplicial sets closely related to operads). With Van den Berg, he also works on sheaf models for predicative logical systems.

#### Postdocs

* [[nLab:Moritz Groth]]

* [[nLab:Dmitry Roytenberg]]

* [[nLab:Urs Schreiber]]

#### PhD students

## About this ##

This is a place that's meant to store information about open problems
in homotopy theory and connected subjects, and (to the extent
possible) some information about what their background is and what has
been tried.

If you have stumbled upon this at random, you should feel free to
read around, or make alterations if you feel that some further
information would be useful.  We are actively soliciting problems from
those in the field; if we have not explicitly asked you, we are still
interested.
