The [[Set|category of sets]] is, among other things, a [[well-pointed topos]] with a [[natural numbers object]] satisfying the [[axiom of choice]]---i.e. a model of [[ETCS]].  However, $Set$ cannot be characterized *uniquely* by this or any other elementary property, i.e. by a property that doesn't refer, explicitly or implicitly, to the notion of set.  This is a version of [[GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorem]].

However, $Set$ can be characterized uniquely by the addition of non-elementary categorial properties, the most notable and obvious of which are [[complete category|completeness]] and [[cocomplete category|cocompleteness]].  On the other hand, it is also true that any [[topos]] is complete and cocomplete relative to itself, in the sense that its [[self-indexing]] is complete and cocomplete as an [[indexed category]].  Thus, in order to characterize $Set$ in this way we have to mean "external" completeness and cocompleteness (which is the intuitive notion of completeness, in the context of some notion of set).

###### Theorem
Let $S$ be a [[locally small category|locally small]] model of ETCS; the following are equivalent.

1. $S$ is equivalent either to $Set$ or to the category of sets in some [[Grothendieck universe]].
1. $S$ admits all coproducts indexed by its own [[homsets]].
1. $S$ admits all products indexed by its own [[homsets]].

###### Proof
The implications from 1 to 2 and 1 to 3 are easy exercises, following from the "second-order replacement axiom" of a Grothendieck universe.  And the implication from 3 to 2 follows because any [[topos]] which has some type of [[limit]] automatically also has the same sort of [[colimit]], because $S^{op}$ is [[monadic adjunction|monadic]] over $S$ (via the contravariant powerset functor).  Thus, it remains to prove that 2 implies 1.  So suppose that $S$ admits coproducts indexed by its homsets.  In particular, for any $X\in S$ we can form the coproduct $\coprod_{x\colon 1\to X} 1$, which of course comes with a canonical map to $X$.  This map is a bijection on [[global elements]], so since $S$ is well-pointed, it is an isomorphism.

Consider the "global sections" functor $\Gamma = S(1,-) \colon S\to Set$.  Well-pointedness implies that this functor is [[faithful functor|faithful]] and [[conservative functor|conservative]].  However, since by the above we have $X\cong \coprod_{\Gamma(X)} 1$, it follows that $\Gamma$ is [[full functor|full]] as well, so that $S$ is equivalent to a [[full subcategory]] of $Set$.  From now on we identify it with its [[essential image]].  If this essential image is all of $Set$, then $S\simeq Set$, so assume that it is not.

Let $X\in S$ and suppose that $Y\subset X$ is a subset of $X$.  By assumption on $S$, it admits the coproduct $\coprod_{x\colon 1\to X} Z_x$ where $Z_x$ is $1$ if $x\in Y$ and $\emptyset$ otherwise.  But this coproduct maps to $Y$ via a bijection on global elements as before, so it is an isomorphism, and thus $Y\in S$ as well.  Therefore, if we let $\kappa$ denote the smallest cardinal number not in $S$, it follows that $S$ consists precisely of the sets of cardinality $\lt\kappa$.  Since $S$ is a topos with a NNO, $\kappa$ must be an uncountable strong limit.  Finally, if $X\in S$ and $Y_x \in S$ for each $x\in X$, then $\coprod_{x\colon 1\to x} Y_x\in S$, showing that $\kappa$ is regular, and hence [[inaccessible cardinal|inaccessible]].

###### Corollary
$Set$ is, up to equivalence, the unique locally small and cocomplete model of ETCS, and the unique locally small and complete model of ETCS.
