By pseudo differential analysis an elliptic operator acting on sections of two vector bundles on a manifold is fredholm hence has closed kernel and cockernel of finite dimension. The difference of these two dimensions is the analytical index. It does not the depend of the Sobolev space used to get a bounded operator (intact by elliptic regularity the kernel is made up of smooth sections and the same for the cockerel as it is the kernel of the adjoint). By topological methods ($K$ theory) one can associate to it a [topological index]. The Atiyah Singer index theorem say that this two indexes coincide.
