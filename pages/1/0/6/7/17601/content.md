## Idea

The closed unit ball of the double dual of a [[Banach space]] is weak* compact. This theorem is equivalent to the [[Tychonoff theorem]] for [[compact space|compact]] [[Hausdorff topological space|Hausdorff]] [[topological space|spaces]] (eg [Rossi 2009](#Rossi09)), and as such is not constructive in general. However, the restriction of the statement to _separable_ Banach spaces _is_ constructive, and is used in PDE theory to find solutions. A constructive proof can be found e.g. in [BridgesVita](#BridgesVita).

## Localic version
As usual, when formulating the theorem using [[locales]] instead of [[topological spaces]] the theorem holds constructively; see [Pelletier](#Pelletier) and [Henry](#Henry).
