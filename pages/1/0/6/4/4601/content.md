## Definition

A __thin__ or __posetal category__ a [[category]] in which, given any two objects $x$ and $y$ and any two morphisms $f$ and $g$ from $x$ to $y$, the morphisms $f$ and $g$ are equal:

$$
      x \underoverset{\quad g \quad}{f}{\rightrightarrows} y \implies f=g
$$


## Properties


Up to [[isomorphism of categories|isomorphism]], a thin category is the same thing as a [[proset]] (a preordered set).  Up to [[equivalence of categories|equivalence]], a thin category is the same thing as a [[poset]].  So mostly we just talk about posets here, but some references want to distinguish these from thin categories.  (It is really a question of whether you\'re working with [[strict categories]], which are classified up to isomorphism, or categories as such, which are classified up to equivalence.)


## Examples

Since a poset is a thin category, in particular [[lattice|(semi)lattices]], [[Heyting algebra|Heyting algebras]], [[frame|frames]] are, too.
