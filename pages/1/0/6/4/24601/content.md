## Idea

Boundary separation is a modular reconstruction of the [[uniqueness of identity proofs]] in [[cubical type theory]]. It is a rule which implies UIP as a theorem. 

## Definition

Recall that in [[cubical type theory]], there is an interval primitive $I$ with endpoints $0:I$ and $1:I$, as well as face formulas $\phi:F$ with rules which make $\phi$ behave like a formula in first-order logic ranging over the interval $I$. 

Boundary separation is the following rule: 

$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \;  \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma \vdash r:I \quad \Gamma, \partial(r) \vdash a \equiv b:A}{\Gamma \vdash a \equiv b:A}$$

where $I$ is the interval primitive in [[cubical type theory]] and $\partial(r)$ is the boundary face formula for dimension variables:

$$\delta(r) \coloneqq r = 0 \vee r = 1$$

(The interval primitive $I$ has more points than $0$ and $1$, so it is not the case that the sequent $r:I \vdash r = 0 \vee r = 1 \;\mathrm{true}$ holds.)

## Proof of UIP from boundary separation

We denote path types by $a =_A b$ and dependent path types by $a =_{i.A} b$. 

Consider the following context: 

$$\Gamma \coloneqq (\Delta, A \; \mathrm{type}, a:A, b:A, p:a =_{A} b, q: a =_A b)$$
