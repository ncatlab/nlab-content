## Definition

A **Stonean locale** is an [[extremally disconnected]] [[Stone locale]].
The category of Stonean locales has [[open maps]] of locales
as morphisms.

Thus, the category of Stonean locales is a (nonfull)
[[subcategory]] of the category of [[Stone locales]].

## Properties

In presence of the [[axiom of choice]],
every [[Stonean locale]] is spatial and the category of Stonean
locales is equivalent to the cateogry of [[Stonean spaces]].

As a variant of [[Stone duality]], the [[category]] of Stonean locales is contravariantly [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to the category
of [[complete Boolean algebras]] and continuous homomorphisms.
One can also reformulate this statement as an equivalence
between the categories of Stonean locales and [[Boolean locales]].

Unlike the corresponding statement for [[Stonean spaces]], this version is fully constructive and is valid in any [[W-topos]].

In fact, the traditional [[Stonean duality]] is an immediate consequence of the localic Stonean duality and the spatiality of Stonean locales.
