_Ab_ is the [[category]] of [[abelian group|abelian groups]].  So, it has abelian groups as [[object|objects]] and group homomorphisms between these as [[morphism|morphisms]].

$Ab$ can be made into a [[monoidal category]] in several ways, the most notable involving [[direct sum]] and [[tensor product]] of abelian groups.  A [[monoid]] [[internalization|internal to]] $(Ab, \otimes)$ is a [[ring]], while a monoid internal to $(Ab, \oplus)$ is just an abelian group.
