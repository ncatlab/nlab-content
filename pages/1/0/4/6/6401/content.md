## Idea

Physicists often refer to [[spaces]] in [[supergeometry]], such as [[supermanifolds]] or [[super schemes]], as _superspaces_, regardless the formalism. Hence a superspace can be an affine superspace (the affine counterpart of the supervector space over real or complex numbers), superscheme, supermanifold (of either Leites or de Witt kind) etc.

Mostly however "superspace" is used for [[superspacetimes]] (e.g. [[super Minkowski spacetimes]]), presented in either formalism.
