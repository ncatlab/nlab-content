#Idea#

_Deformations_ and _deformation retracts_ are tools in [[homotopy theory]] for constructing the [[homotopy category]] of a [[model category]] or more general [[homotopical category]]. 

The idea of a deformation retract is to find a [[full subcategory]] of a given [[homotopical category]] $C$ such that

* a given functor $F$ from $C$ to another [[homotopical category]] becomes a [[homotopical functor]] on this subcategory;

* every object in the category is naturally weakly equivalent to an object in the subcategory.

Deformations are slight generalizations of _cofibrant replacement functors_ in a [[model category]].

#In classical topology#

In the category of all topological spaces one distinguishes several closely related notions. Consider topological pairs $(X,A)$; in other words $A\subset X$. Then $A$ is a __deformation retract__ of $X$ if there exist a continuous map $H:X\times I\to X$ such that $H(a,t)=a$ for all $a\in A$, $t\in I=[0,1]$; $H(x,0) = x$ for all $x\in X$ and $H(x,1)\in A$ for all $x\in X$. A pair $(X,A)$ is a __NDR-pair__ if there are two continuous maps, $u:X\to I$, $H:X\times I\to X$ such that $H(a,t)=a$ for all $a\in A$ and all $t$, $H(x,0)=x$ for all $x\in X$, $u^{-1}(0)=A$ and $H(x,1)\in A$ for all $x$ such that $u(x)\lt 1$. If $(X,A)$ is an NDR-pair, then the inclusion has a left homotopy inverse iff $A$ is also a [[retract]] of $X$ (in [[Top]], in the standard categorical sense). The pair $(X,A)$ is a __DR-pair__ if it is a deformation retract and there is a function $u:X\to I$ such that $A=u^{-1}(0)$ (i.e. it gives simulteneously a deformation retract and a NDR-pair). Id $(X,A)$ is an NDR-pair then the inclusion $A\hookrightarrow X$ is a homotopy equivalence iff $A$ is a deformation retract of $X$. Any map $f:X\to Y$ is a homotopy equivalence iff $X$ is the deformation retract of the mapping cylinder of $f$. If $(X,A)$ is an NDR-pair and $A$ is contractible, then the quotient map $X\to X/A$ is a homotopy equivalence.

#Definition#

Let $C$ be a [[homotopical category]].

* A **left deformation** of $C$ is a functor $Q : C \to C$ equipped with a natural weak equivalence
$$
  \array{
    & \nearrow  \searrow^{Q}&
    \\
    C
    &\Downarrow^{q}_\simeq&
    C
    \\
    & \searrow  \nearrow_{Id}
  }
$$
(it follows from [[category with weak equivalences|2-out-of-3]] that $Q$ is a [[homotopical functor]]).

* A **left deformation retract** is a [[full subcategory]] $C_Q$ containing the image of a left deformation $(Q,q)$.

Now let $F : C \to D$ be a functor between [[homotopical category|homotopical categories]].

* A **left deformation retract for $F$**  is a left deformation retract $C_Q$ of $C$ such that $F$ becomes a [[homotopical functor]] when restricted to $C_Q$.

Right deformations are defined analogously.


#Generalization#

There are pretty obvious generalizations of deformation retracts for functors of more than one variable. 

* A **deformation retract** for a [[two-variable adjunction]] $(\otimes , hom_l, hom_r) : C \times D \to E$ consists of left deformation retracts $C_Q$, $D_Q$ for $C$ and $D$, respectively, and a right deformation retract $E_Q$ of $E$, such that

  * $\otimes$ is [[homotopical functor|homotopical]] on $C_Q \times D_Q$;

  * $hom_l$ is [[homotopical functor|homotopical]] on $C_Q^{op} \times E_Q$;

  * $hom_r$ is [[homotopical functor|homotopical]] on $D_Q^{op} \times E_Q$.
