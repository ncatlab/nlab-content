#Idea#

_Deformations_ and _deformation retracts_ are tools in [[homotopy theory]] for constructing the [[homotopy category]] of a [[model category]] or more general [[homotopical category]]. 

The idea of a deformation retract is to find a full subcategory of a given [[homotopical category]] $C$ such that

* a given functor $F$ from $C$ to another [[homotopical category]] becomes a [[homotopical functor]] on this subcategory;

* every object in the category is naturally weakly equivalent to an object in the subcategory.

Deformations are slight generalizations of _cofibrant replacement functors_ in a [[model category]].

#Definition#

Let $C$ be a [[homotopical category]].

* A **left deformation** of $C$ is a functor $Q : C \to C$ equipped with a natural weak equivalence
$$
  \array{
    & \nearrow  \searrow^{Q}&
    \\
    C
    &\Downarrow^{q}_\simeq&
    C
    \\
    & \searrow  \nearrow_{Id}
  }
$$
(it follows from [[category with weak equivalences|2-out-of-3]] that $Q$ is a [[homotopical functor]]).

* A **left deformation retract** is a full [[subcategory]] $C_Q$ containing the image of a left deformation $(Q,q)$.

Now let $F : C \to D$ be a functor between [[homotopical category|homotopical categories]].

* A **left deformation retract for $F$**  is a left deformation retract $C_Q$ of $C$ such that $F$ becomes a [[homotopical functor]] when restricted to $C_Q$.

Right deformations are defined analogously.


#Generalization#

There are pretty obvious generalizations of deformation retracts for functors of more than one variable. 

* A **deformation retract** for a [[two-variable adjunction]] $(\otimes , hom_l, hom_r) : C \times D \to E$ consists of left deformation retracts $C_Q$, $D_Q$ for $C$ and $D$, respectively, and a right deformation retract $E_Q$ of $E$, such that

  * $\otimes$ is [[homotopical functor|homotopical]] on $C_Q \times D_Q$;

  * $hom_l$ is [[homotopical functor|homotopical]] on $C_Q^{op} \times E_Q$;

  * $hom_r$ is [[homotopical functor|homotopical]] on $D_Q^{op} \times E_Q$.
