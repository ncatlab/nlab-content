In [[Categories for the Working Mathematician]], [[Saunders Mac Lane]] uses the term *metacategory* to mean any model of the [[first-order logic|first-order]] [[theory]] of [[categories]], and reserves the word [[category]] for a metacategory whose [[objects]] and [[morphisms]] form [[sets]].  He then assumes the existence of one [[Grothendieck universe]] $U$ and calls sets and categories in $U$ [[small category|small]] and categories not in $U$ [[large category|large]].  Thus, for him, there is:

* The large category [[Cat]] of all small categories, and

* The metacategory [[CAT]] of all (large) categories.

However, this usage has largely fallen out of favor among modern authors.  Most category theorists nowadays are happy to either use *category* in the more general sense for which Mac Lane used "metacategory," and/or to assume the existence of enough universes that any (meta)category has sets of objects and morphisms.  For instance, if we assume the existence of two universes $U\in U'$, call sets and categories in $U$ "small," those in $U'$ "large," and those (still with a set of objects and morphisms but) not in $U'$ "very large," then we have:

* The large category [[Cat]] of all small categories, and

* The very large category [[CAT]] of all large categories.

The authors of [[The Joy of Cats]] use the term *quasicategory* similarly to how Mac Lane uses "metacategory," but this usage is even more strongly to be avoided, since it conflicts with the more common modern usage (following Joyal) of [[quasicategory]] for a particular model for [[(∞,1)-categories]].
