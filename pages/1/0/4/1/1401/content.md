Just as [[natural transformation|natural transformations]] go between [[functor|functors]], ananatural transformations go between [[anafunctor|anafunctors]].

Given two functors interpreted as anafunctors, the natural transformations and ananatural transformations between them are the same, so the term 'ananatural' is overkill; one only needs it to emphasise the ana-context and otherwise can just say 'natural'.  That is, a 'natural transformation' between anafunctors unambigously means an ananatural transformation.

Of course, an __ananatural isomorphism__ is an invertible ananatural transformation.

I dunno; go read [Makkai](http://www.math.mcgill.ca/makkai/anafun/) or something.
