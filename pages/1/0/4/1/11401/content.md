## Idea

Given a [[measurable space]] $X$ and a [[Hilbert space]] $H$, then a _positive-operator--valued measure_ (POVM) is essentially a [[probability measure]] on $X$ with values in the [[positive operators]] on $H$.

Any such induces a [[quantum operation]] and these are precisely the quantum operations which encode [[quantum measurement]].
