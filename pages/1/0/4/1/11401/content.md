## Idea

Given a [[measurable space]] $X$ and a [[Hilbert space]] $H$, then a _positive-operator--valued measure_ (POVM) is essentially a [[probability measure]] on $X$ with values in the [[positive operators]] on $H$.

If all the positive operators appearing are [[projection operators]] then one speaks of a *projection valued measure* (PVM).

Any PVM induces a [[quantum channel]] and these are precisely the quantum operations which encode (projective) [[quantum measurement]], see at *[[quantum measurement channel]]*. 

Generally, POVMs generate induced [[generalized quantum measurement channels]].
