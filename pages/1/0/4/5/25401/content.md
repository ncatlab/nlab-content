## Idea

A **minimal object** generalizes the notion of minimal element of a preorder. Intuitively, minimal elements are ones that don't have anything below them, even though they might not be _the minimum_. A 'minimum object' would be instead an [[initial object]].

Minimal objects have been first defined in [(Weissmann '22)](#Weissmann22) in the context of [[coalgebra]] theory, relative to an orthogonal factorization system. Trivializing the factorization system gives a general notion of minimality and maximality, though these are quite stronger in categories.

## Definition
### In preorders
\begin{definition}
In a [[preorder]] $(C, \leq)$, a minimal element $m \in C$ is one such that if $a \leq m$, then $m \leq a$. Dually, a maximal element is one such that $m \leq a$ implies $a \leq m$, i.e. which is minimal in $C^{op}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
If $C$ is [[bounded lattice|bounded below]], meaning there  is an element $\bot \in C$ such that $\bot \leq a$ for all $a \in C$ ($\bot$ is [[initial object|initial]]), then $\bot$ is the only minimal element in $C$.
Hence in many cases (chiefly, when $C$ is the preorder of [[ideals]] of a ring), one speaks of minimality in $C\setminus\{\bot\}$, that is, one defines a minimal element to be one for which $a \leq m$ implies $a=m$ _or $a=\bot$.

This is not the definition we take here!
\end{remark}

### In categories
Let $(\mathcal{E}, \mathcal{M})$ be an [[orthogonal factorization system]] on a category $\mathcal{C}$. This means:

0. $\mathcal{E}$ and $\mathcal{M}$ are [[wide subcategories]] of $\mathcal{C}$ closed under composition and each containing all isomorphisms of $\mathcal{C}$.
1. Every morphism in $\mathcal{C}$ factors uniquely as a morphism in $\mathcal{E}$ followed by one in $\mathcal{M}$:
\[
  a \overset{f}\to b = a \overset{e_f}\twoheadrightarrow \mathrm{im}(f) \overset{m_f}\rightarrowtail b.
\]
2. The morphisms in $\mathcal{E}$ are exactly the ones having the [[left lifting property]] against the morphisms in $\mathcal{M}$, and the morphisms in $\mathcal{M}$ are exactly the ones having the [[right lifting property]] against the morphisms in $\mathcal{E}$.
3. The lifts are unique.

Here we'll tend to denote morphisms in $\mathcal{E}$ with $\twoheadrightarrow$ and morphisms in $\mathcal{M}$ with $\rightarrowtail$. In fact, a common source of examples for these factorization systems is given by the systems of [[strong epimorphism|strongly epic]] and [[monic|monomorphism]] arrows.

\begin{definition}
An **$\mathcal{M}$-minimal object** is an object $M:\mathcal{C}$ such that every morphism $h : A \rightarrowtail M$ in $\mathcal{M}$ is an isomorphism.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
An **$\mathcal{E}$-minimal object** is an object $M:\mathcal{C}$ such that every morphism $h : M \twoheadrightarrow A$ in $\mathcal{E}$ is an isomorphism.
\end{definition}

Clearly the two definitions above are dual to each other, since $\mathcal{C}^{op}$ is equipped with the orthogonal factorization system $(\mathcal{M}^{op}, \mathcal{E}^{op})$. Indeed, one might call $\mathcal{E}$-minimal objects **$\mathcal{M}$-maximal**.

\begin{remark}
Instantiating this definition for the trivial factorization systems gives us a general definition of minimal and maximal objects in a category:

In fact, every category admits a trivial orthogonal factorization systems, namely $(\mathcal{I}, \mathcal{C})$, where $\mathcal{I}$ is the [[core|wide subcategory of isomorphisms]] of $\mathcal{C}$. In this instance, every object is $\mathcal{I}$-minimal (since every isomorphism to it is already an iso) but an $\mathcal{I}$-maximal object is one such that every morphism out of it is invertible.
We call these simply **maximal objects**.

Every category also admits $(\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{I})$ as a trivial orthogonal factorization system. In this case, $\mathcal{C}$-minimal objects are the ones for which every morphism into them is invertible, whereas every object is trivially $\mathcal{C}$-maximal. We call these simply **minimal objects**.

These notions recover the order-theoretic ones when $\mathcal{C}$ is a preorder.
\end{remark}

###### Proposition

The following are equivalent:

1. An object $M : \mathcal{C}$ is $\mathcal{M}$-minimal
2. Every morphism $h:A \to M$ is in $\mathcal{E}$.
3. (if $\mathcal{E}$=epimorphisms and $\mathcal{C}$ has [[weak equalizers]]) All parallel pairs of arrows $A \rightrightarrows M$ are equal.

###### Corollary

Dually, the following are equivalent:

1. An object $M : \mathcal{C}$ is $\mathcal{M}$-maximal
2. Every morphism $h:M \to A$ is in $\mathcal{M}$.
3. (if $\mathcal{M}$=monomorphisms and $\mathcal{C}$ has [[weak coequalizers]]) All parallel pairs of arrows $M \rightrightarrows A$ are equal (i.e. $M$ is [[subterminal]])

## Examples

1. Like for preorders, the maximal and minimal objects of a category with initial and terminal object are just those. Not all initial and terminal objects are minimal and maximal though! For instance, a minimal initial object is called [[strict initial object]].
