In his Spencer lecture, delivered at Oxford in 1933, Einstein stressed the importance to be accorded to formal beauty: 

> Experience can of course guide us in our choice of serviceable mathematical concepts; it cannot possibly be the source from which they are derived; experience of course remains the sole criterion of the serviceability of a mathematical construction for physics, but the truly creative principle resides in mathematics.
