## Idea

Constructive set theory is [[set theory]] in the spirit of [[constructive mathematics]]. 

[[Algebraic set theory]] is a categorical presentation of such set theories.

Some more information can be found at [[ZFC]]. Perhaps this should be moved here.

## Axiom systems

There are a number of axiom systems:

### Impredicative set theories

All of these set theories can be interpreted in a [[set-level type theory]] with a [[type of all propositions]]. 

* The impredicative IZF which includes the [[power set]] or [[power object]] axiom. 
* [[SEAR|ISEAR]] - the [[allegorical set theory]] version of IZF. 
* [[ETCS|IETCSR]] - the [[categorical set theory]] version of IZF. 

### Weakly predicative set theories

All of these set theories can be interpreted in [[set-level type theory]] with no [[type of all propositions]], but with [[function types]] and [[dependent function types]]

* The variant CZF for [[predicative mathematics]]. 
* [[SEAR|CSEAR]] - the [[allegorical set theory]] version of CZF. 
* [[ETCS|CETCSR]] - the [[categorical set theory]] version of CZF. 

### Strongly predicative set theories

All of these set theories can be interpreted in [[set-level type theory]] with only dependent function types for families of [[subsingletons]]. 

* [[SEAR|PSEAR]]
