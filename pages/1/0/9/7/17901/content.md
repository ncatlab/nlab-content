## Idea

In describing [[gravity]] ([[general relativity]]) on [[globally hyperbolic spacetimes]] as evolution along a given [[foliation]] of [[spacetime]] by [[spacelike]] slices, the [[Einstein equations]] describe a 1-parameter evolution in a [[configuration space (physics)|configuration space]]/[[moduli space]] of fields on each spatial slice. 

For applications to [[cosmology]] this space may be drastically reduced to retain only some very large scale feature. The resulting configuration space had been called "superspaces" by [[John Wheeler]]. 

On this Wheeler superspace, the [[Einstein equations]] describe the [[classical mechanics]] of a configuration point moving around in superspace. Many or most approaches to [[quantum cosmology]] proceed by taking this reduced mechanical system on Wheeler superspace at face value and applying [[quantization]] to it, hoping that the resulting [[quantum mechanics]] on Wheeler superspace is a sensible approximation to full (and unknown) [[quantum gravity]], at least for purposes of studying [[cosmic structure formation]], [[cosmic inflation]] and similar issues.

## Examples

### In 2d gravity on string worldsheets
 {#In2dGravityOnStringWorldsheets}

The [[worldsheet]]-theory of [[strings]] in [[string theory]] is [[D=2 gravity]] coupled to "matter"-fields (the string's [[sigma-model]] "embedding fields"). For plain [[closed string|closed]] [[bosonic strings]] the corresponding Wheeler superspace is just the [[smooth loop space]] of the string's [[target spacetime]]: each loop in spacetime is the configuration of a closed string at a fixed value of its chosen worldsheet-"time" parameter.

For the [[type II string theory|type II]] [[superstring]] the Wheeler superspace is essentially the [[smooth loop space]] of the [[exterior bundle]] of [[target spacetime]], regarded as a [[supermanifold]]. 

(Beware the clash of "super"-terminology here: the Wheeler superspace of the superstring is now a [[superspace]]-[[Wheeler superspace]], a "super-superspace", where the first "super" is in the sense of [[supersymmetry]]/[[graded manifolds|graded geometry]], while the second "super" in the sense of "[[configuration space (physics)|configuration space]]".

The Wheeler-DeWitt [[quantum mechanics]] of the [[type II superstring theory|type II]] [[superstring]] on its Wheeler superspace, in this sense, is ([Witten 85, from p. 92 (32 of 39) on](supersymmetric+quantum+mechanics#Witten85)) a [[supersymmetric quantum mechanics]] of the form which for finite-dimensional leads to the relation between supersymmetry and Morse theory ([Witten 82](supersymmetric+quantum+mechanics#Witten82)): the Morse-deformed super-charge is the [[Dirac-Ramond operator]] on [[smooth loop space]] (more on this in [Schreiber 04](supersymmetric+quantum+mechanics#Schreiber04)).
