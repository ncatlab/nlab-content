## Idea

The higher analogue of [[sheafification]].

A [[stack]]/[[2-sheaf]] [[2-topos]] on a [[site]]/[[2-site]] $C$ is

$$
  St(C) \stackrel{\overset{L}{\leftarrow}}{\hookrightarrow} PSt(C)
  \,.
$$

The [[left adjoint]] $L$ to the inclusion of [[stack]]s into all [[2-functor]]s on $C^{op}$ is _stackification_ .
