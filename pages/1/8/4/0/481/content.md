A **Heyting category** is a [[coherent category]] in which each [[base change]] functor $f^*:Sub(Y)\to Sub(X)$ has a _right_ adjoint $\forall_f$ (in addition to the left adjoint that exists in any [[regular category]]).  It follows that each $Sub(X)$ is a [[Heyting algebra]] and the base-change functors $f^*$ are Heyting algebra homomorphisms.  Any Heyting category has an [[internal logic]] which is full (typed) first-order [[intuitionistic logic]].

Any [[topos]], and in fact any well-powered [[infinitary coherent category]], is a Heyting category.  Any [[Boolean category]] is also a Heyting category.

A **Heyting functor** is a [[coherent functor]] betwen Heyting categories which additionally preserves the right adjoints $\forall_f$.  Such functors also preserve the internal interpretation of first-order logic.
