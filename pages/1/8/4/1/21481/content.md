The term _$Diff$_ is often used as a name for one of the following [[categories]]:

* the category of [[smooth manifolds]] with [[smooth functions]] between them (see at *[[SmoothManifolds]]*),

* the category of [[differentiable manifolds]] for some degree of differentiation (which authors may or may not indicate by a subscript),

* the category of [[diffeological spaces]].

Beware that all these categories are different (not [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]]), albeit closely related.
