Named after [[Anthony P. Morse]] and [[Arthur Sard]].

## Statement

Recall the following definitions from [[differential topology]].
The set of [[critical points]] of a smooth map $f$ is the set of points in the domain of $f$ where the tangent map is not surjective.
The set of [[critical values]] of $f$ is the $f$-image of the set of [[critical points]] of $f$.
The set of [[regular values]] of $f$ is the complement of the set of [[critical values]] of $f$.

Suppose $M$ and $N$ are [[smooth manifolds]] of dimension $m$ and $n$ respectively
and $f\colon M\to N$ is a $\mathrm{C}^r$-[[smooth map]],
where $r\ge1$ and $r\gt m-n$.
Then the set of critical values in $N$ is a [[meager subset]] (alias first category subset) and a [[negligible subset]] (alias measure zero subset) of $N$.
In particular, the set of [[regular values]] is [[dense]] in $N$.
Furthermore, the $f$-image of points of $M$ where $f$ has rank at most $r$ ($0\lt r\lt m$) has [[Hausdorff dimension]] at most $r$.

If $N$ is a [[Banach manifold]] and $q\ge1$, $f$ is a Fredholm map, and $q$ is strictly greater than the index of $f$, then the critical values of $f$ form a [[meager subset]] of $N$.
