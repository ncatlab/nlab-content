In [[material set theory]], a __reflexive set__ is a set that belongs to itself:
$$ X \in \{X\} .$$
Equivalently, $X$ is reflexive iff it equals its [[successor]] $X \cup \{X\}$.  Compare [[transitive sets]].

By the [[axiom of foundation]], there are no reflexive sets.  In [[ill-founded set]] theory, however, there may be many reflexive sets.

A __Quine atom__ is a minimally reflexive set:
$$ X = \{X\} .$$
In [[Peter Aczel]]\'s ill-founded set theory, there is a unique Quine atom.  On the other hand, by exempting Quine atoms (and only Quine atoms) from the axiom of foundation, one obtains a theory of pure sets equivalent to well-founded material sets with [[urelements]].
