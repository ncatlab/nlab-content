This entry is about the article:

* [[Jacob Lurie]], _Spectral Schemes_

which **doesn't exist yet**.

This studies the theory of [[generalized scheme]]s whose [[structure sheaf]] takes values in [[E-infinity ring]]-spectra.

This is the topic of what some people call [[brave new algebraic geometry]].

Some of this is at least indicated in 

* [[Paul Goerss]], [[Topological Algebraic Geometry - A Workshop]]
