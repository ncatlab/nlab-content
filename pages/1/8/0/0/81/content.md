#Higher category theory in physics#


_Which mathematical structures are_ natural _in physics_?

## Search for a natural language ##

The history of theoretical physics is not the least the story of a search process for suitably notions: while mathematical theories -- such as symplectic geometry, group theory, differential geometry, etc -- are a priori "just languages" -- and each of these languages was upon its introduction to theoretical physics originally met with some hostility (just compare the [Gruppenpest](http://books.google.de/books?id=8QxvNuqxSYIC&pg=RA5-PA209&lpg=RA5-PA209&dq=Pauli+Gruppenpest&source=bl&ots=wG-UJI8nHV&sig=pFyZhKKrut7cB4QGF4bpdQc4ehE&hl=de&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result)  (plague of [[group theory]]) complaint by nobody less than  [Wolfgang Pauli](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Pauli)) -- we do know in retrospect that the modern insights and theorems of, respectively, classical mechanics, [[quantum field theory|quantum mechanics]] and general relativity would have been literally unthinkable without usage of these languages.

##In Mathematics

In pure mathematics the result of such a search process for natural notions has been fully established in the last century: [[category theory]] -- direct generalization in particular of [[group theory]] -- does not only help to put into order existing mathematical knowledge, it has proven to be necessary for even making thinkable certain insights. Such as [[ETCS|set theory]] in 19th century math does [[category theory]] appear today as the natural language of mathematics. This goes as far as making rather [[philosophy|philosophical]] sounding questions such as "What does 'natural' mean in mathematics?" attain a formal and useful meaning: indeed [[category theory]] was discovered by Eilenberg and MacLane in the process of formalizing this term.

The inclined theoretical-mathemtical physicist can hardly regard this development without wondering about concept formation in physics. In view of the in part deeply ontologically satisfactory category theoretic explanations and discoveries in mathematics, the justifiable question is how this convergency to a natural mathematical reality which is clearly being achieved here should reach over to the natural physical reality.

And indeed: quite a few fundamental insights in [[category theory]] originated from theoretical physicists who took the time to follow the structures they had to deal with to their proper nature. In the realm of classical physics this notably is true for [William Lawvere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lawvere) whose study of continuum mechanics led hom to profound categorical formulations of basic physical and ontologivcal concepts (see for instance [[space and quantity]]). In the realm of quantum mechanics there is John Roberts, whose work on [[quantum field theory]] and in particular on [[AQFT|algebraic quantum field theory]] led , among other things, to formulations of [[strict omega-category]] and [[nonabelian cohomology]]. Generally, the quest for an understanding of [[quantum field theory]] keeps driving category theoretic developments, more recently in the context of the [[generalized tangle hypothesis]].

But for one the most important points there is to date no good comprehensive survey: lots of well-known structures in physics are _secretly_ higher categorical structures. See [[BV theory]].
