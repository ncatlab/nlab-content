__Sibe Marde&#353;i&#263;__ is a Croatian [[topology|topologist]], retired Professor at the University of Zagreb and a full member of Croatian Academy of Arts and Sciences (HAZU). His son Pavao Marde&#353;i&#263; is also a mathematician, a specialist in the theory of (low dimensional) dynamical systems.

Most of Sibe Marde&#353;i&#263;'s important works are related to [[shape theory]] and geometric topology, mainly in the approach via inverse systems, which he pioneered (there was also a parallel development by [[Tim Porter]]). Sibe Marde&#353;i&#263; wrote several monographs and edited several proceedings volumes in geometric topology and shape theory.
