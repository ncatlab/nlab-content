[[!redirects free simplicial abelian group functor]]
## Definition

The __free simplicial abelian group functor__
$$\mathbf{Z}[-]\colon sSet \to sAb$$
is given by the functor
$$sSet = Fun(\Delta^{op}, Set) \to Fun(\Delta^{op}, Ab) = sAb,$$
where the middle functor applies the [[free abelian group functor]]
$$\mathbf{Z}[-]\colon Set \to Ab.$$

## Applications

Free simplicial abelian groups
are the crucial ingredient of [[simplicial chains]] and [[simplicial cochains]],
and such also [[simplicial homology]] and [[simplicial cohomology]],
in particular, [[singular homology]] and [[singular cohomology]].
