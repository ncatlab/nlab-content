## Idea

A _strict $\omega$-category_ is a [[globular set|globular]] [[∞-category]] in which all operations obey their respective laws strictly.

This was the original notion of [[∞-category]], and the original meaning of the term [[∞-category]]. Even today, most authors who use that term still mean this notion.

This means that 

 1. all composition operations are strictly associative;

 2. all composition operations strictly commute with all others (strict [[exchange laws]]);

 3. all identity $k$-morphisms are strict identities under all compositions.

## Definition

An **$\omega$-category** $C$ [[internalization|internal to]]  $Sets$ is 

* a [[globular set]] 
$$
  C
    \,\coloneqq\,
  \big(
    \cdots
    C_3 \rightrightarrows
    C_2 \rightrightarrows
    C_1 \rightrightarrows
    C_0
  \big)
$$

* together with the structure of a [[category]] on 
all
$(  C_{k} \rightrightarrows C_l )$ for all $k \gt l$;

* such that 
 $\big(  C_{k} \rightrightarrows
  C_{l} \rightrightarrows C_m \big)$ for all $k \gt l \gt m$;
is a [[strict 2-category]].

Similarly for an $\omega$-category [[internalization|internal to]]  another ambient category $A$.

The category $\omega Cat(A)$ of $\omega$-categories [[internalization|internal to]] $A$ has $\omega$-categories
as its objects and morphism of the underlying globular objects respecting all the above extra structure as morphisms.

## Remarks

* The last condition in the above definition says that all pairs of composition operations satisfy the [[exchange law]].

* {#AsADirectLimit} $\omega$-Categories can also be understood as the [[directed limit]] of the [[sequence]] of iterated [[enriched category theory|enrichments]]

    \xhookrightarrow{\phantom{-}}
    (2 Cat \,\coloneqq\, Cat\text{-}Cat)
    \xhookrightarrow{\phantom{-}}
    \big(
      3 Cat 
        \,\coloneqq\, 
      (2Cat)\text{-}Cat \simeq (Cat\text{-}Cat)\text{-}Cat
    \big)
    \xhookrightarrow{\phantom{-}}
    \cdots
    \,.

* The category of strict $\omega$-categories admits a [[closed monoidal category|biclosed monoidal structure]] called the [[Crans-Gray tensor product]].

* The category of strict $\omega$-categories also admits a [[canonical model structure]].

* Terminology on $\omega$-categories varies. We here follow section 2.2 of [[Sjoerd Crans]]: [Pasting presentations for $\omega$-categories](http://home.tiscali.nl/secrans/papers/thpp.html), where it says 

  * _[[Ross Street|Street]] allowed $\omega$-categories to have infinite dimensional cells. Steiner has the extra condition that every cell has to be finite dimensional, and called them $\infty$-categories, following [[Ronnie Brown|Brown]] and Higgins. I will use Steiner's approach here since that's the one that reflects the notion of higher dimensional homotopies closest, but I will nonethless call them $\omega$-categories, and I agree with [[Dominic Verity|Verity]]'s suggestion to call the other ones $\omega^+$-categories._



* [[Simpson's conjecture]], a statement about [[semi-strict infinity-category|semi-strictness]], states that every weak $\infty$-category should be equivalent to an $\infty$-category in which strictness conditions 1. and 2. hold, but not 3.


## As simplicial sets 

Under the [[oriental|∞-nerve]] 

$$
  N \,\colon\, Str \omega Cat \longrightarrow SSet
$$

strict $\omega$-categories yield simplicial sets that are called [[complicial sets]]. 

\begin{proposition}
The categories of $\omega$-categories and complicial sets are [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]].
\end{proposition}

This is sometimes called the _Street-Roberts conjecture_. It was completely proven in

* Dominic Verity, _Complicial sets_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0410412))

which also presents the history of the conjecture.

Based on this fact, there are attempts to weaken the condition on a [[simplicial set]] to be a [[complicial set]] so as to obtain a notion of [[simplicial weak ∞-category]].

* [[complicial set]]

## References

Strict $\omega$-categories have probably been independently invented by several people.  

According to [Street 09, p. 10](#Street09) the concept was first brought up in

* {#Roberts79} [[John E. Roberts]], *Mathematical Aspects of Local Cohomology*, in: *Algèbres d’opérateurs et leurs applications en physique mathématique*, Colloques Internationaux du Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (C.N.R.S) **274**, Paris (1979) 321–332 &lbrack;ISBN:2-222-02441-2, [pdf](https://dmitripavlov.org/scans/roberts-mathematical-aspects-of-local-cohomology.pdf), [[Roberts-LocalCohomology.pdf:file]]&rbrack;

in an attempt to define [[non-abelian cohomology]] (of [[local nets of observables]] in [[algebraic quantum field theory]]).

Possibly the earliest published definition is due to

* [[Ronnie Brown]] and P. J. Higgins, _The equivalence of $\infty$-groupoids and crossed complexes_, Cah. Top. G&#233;om. Diff. 22 (1981) no. 4, 371-386 [web](http://www.numdam.org/item?id=CTGDC_1981__22_4_371_0).

which also contains the definitions of [[n-fold category]] and of what was later called [[globular set]]. There these strict, globular higher categories are called "$\infty$-categories" while "$\omega$-groupoid" is used  to mean a cubical set with connections and compositions, each a groupoid, as in

Related monoidal closed structures were developed in:

$\omega$-groupoids and crossed complexes_,  J. Pure Appl.

in which strict $\omega$-categories are called "$\omega$-categories."  This paper was also the first to define [[orientals]].

where they prove that strict globular $\omega$-categories are equivalent to $\omega$-fold categories (aka "cubical $\omega$-categories") equipped with [[connections]]. This paper also develops the monoidal closed structures.
