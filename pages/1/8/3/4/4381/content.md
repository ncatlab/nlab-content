The **permutation groupoid**, sometimes denoted $\mathbb{P}$, is a [[skeleton]] of the [[groupoid]] of [[finite sets]] and [[bijections]].  Namely:

$$ \mathbb{P} = \bigsqcup_{n \ge 0} S_n \, , $$

where objects are [[natural numbers]], all morphisms are [[automorphisms]], and the [[automorphism group]] of the object $n$ is the [[symmetric group]] $S_n$. 

In other words, $\mathbb{P}$ is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to the [[core]] of [[FinSet]].

There are many notations for $\mathbb{P}$ besides '$\mathbb{P}$', such as $S$ and $\Sigma$.  In _[[The Joy of Cats]]_, $\mathbb{P}$ is denoted $Bij$.
