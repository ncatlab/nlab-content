## Definition

For $S_n$ a [[symmetric group]], its _alternating representation_ is the 1-[[dimension|dimensional]] [[linear representation]]

$$
  alt \;\; S_n \longrightarrow GL(1)
$$

which sends even [[permutations]] to $+1$ and odd permutations to $-1$.

More generally, for $G$ any [[finite group]] and $H \subset G$ a [[subgroup]] of [[index of a subgroup|index]] 2, then the corresponding alternating representation of $G$ sends elements of $H$ to $+1$ and all other elements to -1.

This reduces to the previous special case by setting $G \coloneqq S_n$ and $H \coloneqq A_n \subset S_n$ the [[alternating group]].
