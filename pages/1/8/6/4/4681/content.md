A __$K$-linear map__ (also __$K$-linear function__ or __$K$-linear operator__) is a [[morphism]] in $K$-[[Vect]] (or $K$-[[Mod]]), that is a [[homomorphism]] of [[vector spaces]] (or [[modules]]).  Often one suppresses mention of the [[field]] (or [[commutative ring]] or [[rig]]) $K$.

In elementary terms, a __$K$-linear map__ between $K$-[[linear spaces]] $V$ and $W$ is a [[function]] $T\colon V \to W$ such that
$$ T(r x + y) = r T(x) + T(y) ,$$
for $x$ and $y$ elements of $V$ and $r$ an element of $K$.  (It is an easy exercise that this one identity is enough to ensure that $T$ is a homomorphism.)

In the study of [[Hilbert spaces]], a __linear operator__ is often only a [[partial function]], but we still require the [[domain]] of the operator to be a linear [[subspace]] (after which the definition above applies).  The [[densely-defined operator]]s (where the domain is a [[dense subspace]]) are particularly important.
