## Definition

A family of subsets of a [[topological space]], for which for every point the intersection of subsets containing it is open, is called an _inner-preserving family_ or _Q family_.

A [[topological space]], for which every (countable) open covering has an inner-preserving open [[refinement]], is called _(countably) orthocompact_.

## Properties

\begin{prop}
[[P-spaces]] are countably orthocompact.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof} Follows directly from the fact that _every_ countable [[open covering]] of a [[P-space]] is already inner-preserving.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
Spaces with [[Alexandroff topology]] are orthocompact.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof} Follows directly from the fact that _every_ [[open covering]] of a space with [[Alexandroff topology]] is already inner-preserving.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
Given an orthocompact space $X$, the [[product space]] $X\times[0,1]$ is orthocompact iff $X$ is countably [[metacompact]].
\end{theorem}
