## Definition

A family of subsets of a [[topological space]], for which for every point the intersection of subsets containing it is open, is called an _inner-preserving family_ or _Q family_.

A [[topological space]], for which every (countable) open covering has an inner-preserving open [[refinement]], is called _(countably) orthocompact_.
