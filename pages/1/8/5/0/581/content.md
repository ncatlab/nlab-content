# Definition #

A **split epimorphism** in a [[category]] $C$ is a [[morphism]] $e:A\to B$ which has a [[section]], meaning a morphism $s:B\to A$ such that $e s = 1_B$.

In such a situation one also says that $B$ is a [[retract]] of $A$, and that $B$ is a splitting of the [[idempotent]] $s e:A \to A$.

# Remarks #

* Any split epimorphism is automatically a [[regular epimorphism]] (it is the [[coequalizer]] of $s e$ and $1_A$), and therefore also a [[strong epimorphism]], an [[extremal epimorphism]], and an [[epimorphism]].

* The [[axiom of choice]] internal to a category $C$ can be phrased as "all epimorphisms are split."  In [[Set]] this is equivalent to the usual axiom of choice; in many other categories it is just false.
