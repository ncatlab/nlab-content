## Idea

By a *no-go theorem* one generally means (commonly so in [[theoretical physics]]) a [[theorem]] which shows that some approach is not possible even though it may appear as if it should be. In practice, since no-go theorems typically depend on assumptions, they often serve to bring out key loopholes in common arguments.

Examples of no-go theorems in [[theoretical physics]] include

in foundations of [[quantum physics]]:

* [[Bell's theorem]]

* [[Kochen-Specker theorem]]

* [[Gleason's theorem]]

* [[Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph theorem]]

in [[quantum field theory]]:

* [[Coleman-Mandula theorem]]

in [[supergravity]]:

* [no de Sitter spacetime (?)](de+Sitter+spacetime#ReferencesInStringTheory)

* [no ekpyrotic cosmology (?)](ekpyrotic+cosmology#ReferencesEmbeddingIntoStringTheory)
