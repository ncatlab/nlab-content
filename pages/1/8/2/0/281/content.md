An _automorphism_ of an [[object]] $x$ in a [[category]] $C$ is an [[isomorphism]] that $f : x \to x$.

In other words, an _automorphism_ is an [[isomorphism]] that is an [[endomorphism]].

Given an object $x$, the automorphisms of $x$ form a [[group]] under composition, the __automorphism group__ of $x$, written 

$$
  Aut_C(x) \subset End_C(x) = Hom_C(x,x)
$$ 

or $Aut(x)$ if the category $C$ is understood.  

Up to equivalence, every group is an automorphism group; see [[delooping]].
