## Definition

A **pre-Lie algebra** is a [[vector space]] $A$ equipped with a bilinear operation $\cdot: A \times A \to A$ such that
\[      [L_a, L_b] = L_{[a,b]}  \label{basic_identity} \]
for all $a, b\in A$.  Here $L_a$ is the operation of left multiplication by $a$:
$$ L_a b = a \cdot b $$
and $[L_a, L_b]$ is the usual commutator of operators using [[composition]]:
$$ [L_a, L_b] = L_a L_b - L_b L_a $$
while $[a,b]$ is the commutator defined using the $\cdot$ operation:
$$ [a,b] = a \cdot b - b \cdot a$$

Unravelling this, we see a pre-Lie algebra is vector space $A$ equipped with a bilinear operation $\cdot: A \times A \to A$ such that
\[ a \cdot (b \cdot c) - b \cdot (a \cdot c) = 
(a \cdot b) \cdot c - (b \cdot a) \cdot c  \label{identity} \]
More precisely, this is a **left** pre-Lie algebra.  We can also define right pre-Lie algebras.

Every [[associative algebra]] is a pre-Lie algebra, but not conversely.  The reason pre-Lie algebras have the name they do is that this weakening of the concept of associative algebra is still enough to give a [[Lie algebra]]!  In other words: it is well-known that if $A$ is an associative algebra, the operation
$$  [a,b] = a \cdot b - b \cdot a $$
makes $A$ into a Lie algebra.  But this is also true for pre-Lie algebras!  It is a fun exercise to derive the Jacobi identity from equation \eqref{identity}.


## Examples

First, given a [[manifold]] with a torsion-free [[connection]] $\nabla$ on its [[tangent bundle]], we can make the space of [[tangent vector fields]] into a pre-Lie algebra by defining
$$  v \cdot w = \nabla_v w $$
The definition of 'torsion-free' is precisely \eqref{basic_identity}.  The Lie algebra arising from this pre-Lie algebra is just the usual Lie algebra of vector fields.

Isn't it the case the connection must be both torsionless and flat (i.e., the curvature is zero) in order for the PLA (pre-Lie algebra) conditions to be satisified?  Thanks.

Second, suppose $O$ is a [[linear operad]], and let $A$ be the free $O$-[[algebra of an operad|algebra]] on one generator.  As a vector space we have
$$  A = \bigoplus_{n} O_n/S_n \, .$$
Here $S_n$ is the [[symmetric group]], which acts on the space $O_n$ of $n$-ary operations of $O$.  Moreover, $A$ becomes a pre-Lie algebra in a manner described here:

Third, the [[Hochschild cohomology|Hochschild]] [[chain complex]] of any associative algebra, with grading shifted down by one, can be given the structure of a '[[graded object|graded]] pre-Lie algebra', as discovered by Gerstenhaber and described here:

* Justin Thomas, [Graduate student seminar: Hochschild cohomology](http://www.math.northwestern.edu/~jdthomas/Talk%20Notes/Hoch%20Cohomology.pdf)

In fact it was Gerstenhaber who coined the term 'pre-Lie algebra', for this reason.

## Relation to the work of Connes and Kreimer

Connes and Kreimer formalized the process of [renormalization](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/renormalization#hopfalgebraic_renormalization_3) using a certain [Hopf algebra] built from Feynman diagrams.  More abstractly we can understand the essence of their construction using a Hopf algebra built from rooted trees, as explained here:

* John Baez, This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics, Week 299.  ([web](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week299.html))  ([blog](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2010/06/this_weeks_finds_in_mathematic_60.html))

The key is to form the free pre-Lie algebra on one generator, then turn this into a Lie algebra as described above, and then form the universal enveloping of that, which is a cocommutative Hopf algebra.  Finally, the restricted dual of this cocommutative Hopf algebra is the commutative Hopf algebra considered by Connes and Kreimer here:

* Alain Connes and Dirk Kreimer, Hopf algebras, renormalization and noncommutative geometry, _Commun. Math. Phys._ **199** (1998), 203--242 ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9808042))

Pre-Lie algebras are algebras of a [[linear operad]] called $PL$.  The space $PL_n$ has a basis given by labelled rooted [[trees]] with $n$ vertices, and the $i$th partial composite $s \circ_i t$ is given by summing all the possible ways of inserting the tree $t$ inside the tree $s$ at the vertex labelled $i$.  For details see:

* Fr&#233;d&#233;ric Chapoton, Muriel Livernet, Pre-Lie algebras and the rooted trees operad, _Int. Math. Res. Not._ 2001 (2001), 395-408.

The free pre-Lie algebra on one generator is thus
$$\bigoplus_{n} PL_n /S_n  \, $$
so the description of $PL_n$ in terms of rooted trees gives a kind of 'explanation' of the relation between the Connes--Kreimer Hopf algebra and rooted trees.

## Self-referentiality ##

Pre-Lie algebras have a strange self-referential feature.  Every operad of a large class gives a pre-Lie algebra, but the operad for pre-Lie algebras is one of this class!  This raises the following interesting puzzle.

As we have seen above, for any linear operad $O$, the free $O$-algebra with one generator becomes a pre-Lie algebra.  But the operad for pre-Lie algebra is an operad of this type.  So, the free pre-Lie algebra on one generator becomes a pre-Lie algebra in this way.   But of course it already *is* a pre-Lie algebra!  Do these pre-Lie structures agree?

The answer is no.  For an explanation, see page 7 here:
