* [[Kant]]

  _Kritik der Reinen Vernunft_ (Critique of Pure Reason), abbreviated KrV.

  * [first edition 1781](#1stEd). Normally and in this article denoted by "A", e.g. "A111" refers to page 111 of the original first edition. But the Akademieausgabe uses A¹.

  * [second edition 1787](#2ndEd). Normally and in this article denoted by "B". Akademieausgabe uses A².

  The second edition comprises a considerable extension of the first addition, though some passages were left out in former.

### Transcendental Doctrine of Elements

#### Transcendental Aesthetics

> The science of all the principles of sensibility a priori, I call transcendental aesthetic.* There must, then, be such a science forming the first part of the transcendental doctrine of elements, in contradistinction to that part which contains the principles of pure thought, and which is called transcendental logic. 

##### Of Space

For Kant space is not a concept but an intuition, more precisely an intuition, "which serves for the foundation of all external intuitions". Kant develops this view in the following steps (A24-25/B38-40)

>  1. Space is not a conception which has been derived from outward experiences. For, in order that certain sensations may relate to something without me (that is, to something which occupies a different part of space from that in which I am); in like manner, in order that I may represent them not merely as without, of, and near to each other, but also in separate places, the representation of space must already exist as a foundation. ...

> 2. Space then is a necessary representation a priori, which serves for the foundation of all external intuitions. We never can imagine or make a representation to ourselves of the non-existence of space, though we may easily enough think that no objects are found in it. ...

> 3. Space is no discursive, or as we say, general conception of the relations of things, but a pure intuition. For, in the first place, we can only represent to ourselves one space, and, when we talk of divers spaces, we mean only parts of one and the same space. Moreover, these parts cannot antecede this one all-embracing space, as the component parts from which the aggregate can be made up, but can be cogitated only as existing in it. Space is essentially one, and multiplicity in it, consequently the general notion of spaces, of this or that space, depends solely upon limitations. ...

The intuition (in the ordinary sense) Kant has concerning space is similar to a number theorist who considers "the" [[natural number|natural numbers]] as the object of her studies, though she certainly has limitations in specifying what she means. Indeed, common way to do so have limitation: for instance, one can not uniquely determine the natural numbers by a list of axioms, as [[incompleteness theorem|Gödel's fist incompleteness theorem]] demonstrates, nor is it satisfying to describe the natural numbers by a concrete model, because there are several ways to do so.

Due to his intuition that there is "one" space, Kant discards the first two out of the three possibilities he discusses.
Since Kant this intuition has been dropped mostly by geometers in favor of the first introducing pioneering concepts like [[On the hypotheses which underlie geometry|Riemannian manifolds in 1854]]. In his very early work [[Bertrand Russell]] tried to adapt Kant's work to this new view (see [[An Essay on the Foundations of Geometry]]). Later Kant's idea appeared again in the framework of [[noncommutative geometry]] ([Petitot 2009](#Petitot09)) 

Actually, all three possibilities discussed by Kant appear in modern mathematics:

1. the "discursive, or .., general conception" is just the most common way to describe a space by a list of axioms, e.g. a [[topological space]] or a [[metric space]].

1. a space that "antecede this one all-embracing space, as the component parts from which the aggregate can be made up" (German: "vor dem einigen allbefassenden Raume gleichsam als dessen Bestandtheile (daraus seine Zusammensetzung möglich sei) vorhergehen"). A modern concept that matches this description quite well is the concept of a [[classifying space]], that does not contain each member of a certain class of spaces as a subspace, but from which "antecede" each such space by [[pullback]].

1. "Space is essentially one, and multiplicity in it, consequently the general notion of spaces, of this or that space, depends solely upon limitations." (German: "Er [Der Raum] ist wesentlich einig, das Mannigfaltige  in ihm, mithin auch der allgemeine Begriff von Räumen überhaupt beruht lediglich auf Einschränkungen.") A situation like this is found if any space in a geometrical theory can be considered as a subspace of one fix space. Good examples of such situations are given, as mentioned, by noncommutative geometry ([Petitot 2009](#Petitot09)), which is concerned with subspaces of the space of bounded operators on a [[separable space|separable]] [[Hilbert space]], or by [[descriptive set theory]] that can be understood as the study of subsets of the real line.

  Making such comparisons maybe a word of caution is in order to note that what Kant meant by the intuition of e.g. "space" is certainly not exactly any of the objects described above. But Kant's "formal intuition" ("formale Anschauung"), which he mentions later in the Transcendental Deduction as a footnote in B §26, comes probably quite close.



##### Of Time

#### Transcendental Logic

Achourioti and van Lambalgen ([2011/2012](#AchouriotiVanLambalgen)) offered a formalization of Kant's logic in terms of [[geometric logic]].

##### Introduction (General Logic and Transcendental Logic)

In the development of Kant's distinction between general logic and transcendental logic Kant's _[[Attempt to Introduce the Concept of Negative Quantities into Philosophy]]_ from 1763 constitutes a crucial step.

##### Of the Transcendental Clue [Leitfaden] to the Discovery of all Pure Conceptions of the Understanding

## On Aristotelian logic


Regarding [[Aristotelian logic]]:

> _Concepts [Begriffe] ... serve as predicates of possible judgements._ ([[Critique of Pure Reason]] A69/B94)

Compare to the identification of concepts with the [[types]] in the sense of [[type theory]], see the references [here](Science+of+Logic#ReferencesConceptLogicAsTypeTheory).
