  Regarding the [[n-sphere]] as the [[unit sphere]] inside [[Cartesian space]], $S^n \,\simeq\, S(\mathbb{R}^{n+1})$, the *antipode* of any point $p \,\in\, S^n \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n=1}$ is the point $-p \,\in\, S^n \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ obtained by sending the [[coordinates]] of $p$ to their negatives.

  The [[quotient space]] of the [[n-sphere]] by the [[cyclic group of order two|$\mathbb{Z}/2$]]-[[group action|action]] given by switching antipodes is the [[real projective space]] $\mathbb{R}P^{n-1}$.

* In [[algebra]]:

  The *antipode* of a *[[Hopf algebra]]* is the [[formal duality|formal dual]] of the operation of passing to [[inverse elements]] in a [[group]].

  If the Hopf algebra is the [[Pontrjagin ring]]-structure on the [[homology of loop spaces|homology of loop spaces]], then this antipode-operation corresponds to reversal of orientation of loops.
