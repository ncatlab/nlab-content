## Idea

In [[homotopy type theory]], a _suspension type_ of any [[type]] $X$ is the [[pushout type]] of the terminal function $X \to \ast$ (to the [[unit type]]) along itself, hence the pushout of the [[span]] $\ast \longleftarrow X \longrightarrow \ast$.

The [[categorical semantics]] is given by [[suspension objects]] in [[homotopy theory]] (and hence by [[suspension]] of [[topological spaces]] in, say, the [[classical model structure on topological spaces]]). 

## Definition
 {#Definition}

As a [[higher inductive type]], the (unreduced) suspension $\mathrm{S} X$ of a type $X$ is generated by

1. A term $\mathrm{nth} \colon \mathrm{S} X$

1. a term $\mathrm{sth} \colon \mathrm{S} X$

1. A function $mer \colon X \to Id_{\mathrm{S}X}\big(nth,\, sth\big)$ 

   (to the [[identity type]] of $\mathrm{S}X$).

The resulting [[inference rules]] are the specialization of those of [[pushout types]] (see [there](pushout+type#InferenceRules)).

In [[Coq]] [[pseudocode]] this becomes

    Inductive Suspension (X \colon Type) : Type
      | nth : Suspension X
      | sth : Suspension X
      | mer : X -> Id Suspension X nth sth

This says that the type is [[dependent type|dependent]] on the type $X$ and inductive constructed from two [[terms]] in the suspension, whose [[semantics|interpretation]] is as the north and south poles of the suspension, together with a term in the [[function type]] from $X$ to the [[identity type]] of paths between these two terms, representing the [[meridians]] from the north to the south pole.

## Examples

* The [[two-valued type]] $\mathbf{2}$ is the suspension type of the [[empty type]] $\mathbf{0}$. 

* The [[interval type]] $I$ is the suspension type of the [[unit type]] $\mathbf{1}$. 

* The [[circle type]] $S^1$ is the suspension type of $\mathbf{2}$.

* The homotopical disk type $G_2$ is the suspension type of $I$.

* Homotopical $n$-sphere types of dimension $n:\mathbb{N}$, $S^n$, are suspension types of $S^{n-1}$. 

* Homotopical $n$-[[globe]] types of dimension $n:\mathbb{N}$, $G_n$, are suspension types of $G_{n-1}$.
