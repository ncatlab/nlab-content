## Definition

On a [[local topos]]/[[local (∞,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$, hence equipped with a [[full and faithful (∞,1)-functor|fully faithful]] extra [[right adjoint]] $coDisc$ to the [[global section]] [[geometric morphism]] $(Disc \dashv \Gamma)$,  is induced an  [[idempotent monad]] $\sharp \coloneqq coDisc \circ \Gamma$, a [[modality]] which we call the _sharp modality_. This is itself the [[right adjoint]] in an [[adjoint modality]] with the [[flat modality]] $\flat \coloneqq Disc \circ \Gamma$.

### In type theory

We assume a [[dependent type theory]] with crisp term judgments $a::A$ in addition to the usual type and (cohesive) term judgments $A \; \mathrm{type}$ and $a:A$, as well as context judgments $\Xi \vert \Gamma \; \mathrm{ctx}$ where $\Xi$ is a list of crisp term judgments, and $\Gamma$ is a list of cohesive term judgments. In addition, we also assume the dependent type theory has [[typal equality]] and [[judgmental equality]]. 

From here, there are two different notions of the sharp modality which could be defined in the type theory, the **strict sharp modality**, which uses [[judgmental equality]] in the [[computation rule]] and [[uniqueness rule]], and the **weak sharp modality**, which uses [[typal equality]] in the [[computation rule]] and [[uniqueness rule]]. When applied to a type they result in **strict sharp types** and **weak sharp types** respectively. The [[natural deduction]] rules for strict and weak sharp types are provided as follows:

* Formation rule for weak and strict sharp types:

$$\frac{\Xi, \Gamma \vert () \vdash A \; \mathrm{type}}{\Xi \vert \Gamma \vdash \sharp A \; \mathrm{type}}\sharp-\mathrm{form}$$

* Introduction rule for weak and strict sharp types:

$$\frac{\Xi, \Gamma \vert () \vdash a:A}{\Xi \vert \Gamma \vdash a^\sharp:\sharp A}\sharp-\mathrm{intro}$$

* Elimination rule for weak and strict sharp types:

$$\frac{\Xi \vert () \vdash a:\sharp A}{\Xi \vert \Gamma \vdash a_\sharp:A}\sharp-\mathrm{elim}$$

* Computation rule for weak and strict sharp types respectively:

$$\frac{\Xi \vert () \vdash a:A}{\Xi \vert \Gamma \vdash \beta_{\sharp A}(a):(a^\sharp)_\sharp =_A a}\sharp-\mathrm{comp}\mathrm{weak} \qquad \frac{\Xi \vert () \vdash a:A}{\Xi \vert \Gamma \vdash (a^\sharp)_\sharp \equiv a:A}\sharp-\mathrm{comp}\mathrm{strict}$$

* Uniqueness rule for weak and strict sharp types respectively:

$$\frac{\Xi \vert () \vdash a:\sharp A}{\Xi \vert \Gamma \vdash \eta_{\sharp A}(a):(a_\sharp)^\sharp =_{\sharp A} a}\sharp-\mathrm{uniq}{weak} \qquad \frac{\Xi \vert () \vdash a:\sharp A}{\Xi \vert \Gamma \vdash (a_\sharp)^\sharp \equiv a:\sharp A}\sharp-\mathrm{uniq}\mathrm{strict}$$

Weak sharp modalities are primarily used in cohesive [[objective type theories]], while strict sharp modalities are typically used in cohesive type theories with [[judgmental equality]], such as cohesive [[Martin-Löf type theory]] ([[cohesive homotopy type theory]] or cohesive [[higher observational type theory]]. 

## Properties

### Relation to discrete and codiscrete objects

* The [[codiscrete objects]] in a local topos are the [[modal types]] for the sharp modality.

* The [[discrete objects]] in a local topos are the [[modal types]] for the [[flat modality]].

The terminology of the sharp-modality in the above sense was introduced -- in the language of [[(infinity,1)-toposes|$(\infty,1)$-toposes]] and as part of the axioms on "[[cohesive (infinity,1)-toposes|cohesive $(\infty,1)$-toposes]]" -- in:
