__Connes' cyclic category__ $\Lambda$ is the full subcategory of $\mathrm{Cat}$ whose objects are the categories $[n]_\Lambda$ which are freely generated by the graph $0\to 1\to 2\to\ldots\to n\to 0$. 

Cyclic objects in a category $C$ are the contravariant functors $\Lambda^{\mathrm{op}}\to C$, [[cocyclic object]]s are the covariant functors $\Lambda\to C$. This standard terminology is repeating the usual confusion from simplicial categories, because $\Lambda$ itself is, via $\mathrm{id}_\Lambda$, an example of a cocyclic category; hence one should maybe say the [[category of cycles]], what is not customary for $\Lambda$.
