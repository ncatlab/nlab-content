Str&#248;m has proven that the category of ALL topological spaces  has a structure of Quillen [[model category]] where fibrations are Hurewicz fibrations, cofibrations are closed Hurewicz cofibration and the role of weak equivalences is played by (strong) homotopy equivalences. The theorem might have been a folklore at the time, but the actual paper has a number of subtleties. 

Str&#248;m's proofs are not that well-known today and use techniques better known to the topologists at that time, and there is consequently a slight controversy among topologists now. One of the things is that there are modern reproofs, but these modern techniques essentially use the compactly generated Hausdorff spaces, while Str&#248;m's proofs succeeded to avoid that assumption.
