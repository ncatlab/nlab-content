## Overview

The category of __prisms__ is one of the [[geometric shapes for higher structures]].
The resulting [[presheaves]] of sets are known as [[multisimplicial sets]].
These were used by Laures and McClure in their work on [[Quinn spectra]].

## Definition

The category of $n$-fold prisms is the $n$-fold [[product]]
of the [[category of simplices]] $\Delta$.

[[Presheaves]] on this category are known as $n$-fold multisimplicial sets. Special cases for low $n$ include [[sets]], [[simplicial sets]] and [[bisimplicial sets]].

Restricting to injective maps of simplices,
we get $n$-fold multisemisimplicial sets.
