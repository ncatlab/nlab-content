## Idea

B&#233;zout's theorem states sufficient conditions (transversality) such that the [[intersection product]] of two [[algebraic curves]] inside an ambient [[algebraic surface]] gives literally the number of points at which the curves intersect.

This is the origin of _[[intersection theory]]_, see there for more. 

The refinement of B&#233;zout's theorem for non-transversally intersecting varieties is _[[Serre's intersection formula]]_
