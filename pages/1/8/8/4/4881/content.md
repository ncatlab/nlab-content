## Definition

### In topology and differential geometry

The **torus** is the [[manifold]] (a [[smooth manifold]], hence in particular also a [[topological manifold]]) obtained as the [[quotient]] 

$$
  T \coloneqq \mathbb{R}^2 / \mathbb{Z}^2
$$ 

of the [[Cartesian space|Cartesian plane]], regarded as an [[abelian group]], by the subgroup of pairs of [[integers]].

As a [[topological space]] this is the [[quotient topological space]] obained from the [[square]] by identifying opposite sides:

More generally, for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ any [[natural number]], the _$n$-torus_ is

$$
  T \coloneqq \mathbb{R}^n / \mathbb{Z}^n
  \,.
$$ 

For $n = 1$ this is the [[circle]].

In this fashion each torus canonically carries the structure of an [[abelian group]], in fact of an abelian [[Lie group]]. Notice that regarded as a [[group]] the torus carries a [[pointed object|base point]] (the neutral element). 

### In algebraic geometry
 {#InAlgebraicGeometry}

According to [[SGA]]3, for $X$ a base [[scheme]] then a 1-dimensional torus (in the sense of tori-as-groups) over it is a [[group scheme]] over $X$ which becomes [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[multiplicative group]] over $X$ after a [[faithfully flat morphism|faithfully flat]] [[group extension]].

In ([Lawson-Naumann 12, def. A.1](#LawsonNaumann12))  this is called "a form of" the multiplicative group over $X$. 

By ([Lawson-Naumann 12, prop. A.4](#LawsonNaumann12)) the [[moduli stack of 1-dimensional tori]] $\mathcal{M}_{1dtori}$  in this sense is equivalent to the [[delooping]] of the [[group of order two]]:

$$
  \mathcal{M}_{1dtor}
  \simeq
  \mathbf{B}\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}
  \,.
$$

The single nontrival [[automorphism]] of any 1-dimensional toris here is that induced by the canonical automorphism of the multiplicative group

$$
  Aut(\mathbb{G}_m) \simeq \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}
$$

which is the [[inversion involution]] (given by sending any element to its [[inverse]] element).

### As a homotopy type

As a [[homotopy type]] the torus is the product of two copies of the [circle](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/circle#as_a_homotopy_type).

In [[homotopy type theory]] the torus can be formalized as the [[higher inductive type]] generated by a point `base`, two paths, $p$ and $q$, from `base` to itself, and an element $t$ of $p\cdot q = q \cdot p$. It has been formally shown ([Sojakova15](#Sojakova15)) that this type is equivalent to the product of two circles. For a treatment in [[cubical type theory]], see ([Licata-Brunierie](#Licata-Brunierie)).

{#StableHomotopyType} The *[[stable homotopy type]]* of the torus is the [[wedge sum]] of 2 circles and one [[2-sphere]] (eg. [Freed & Moore 13, Thm. 11.8](#FreedMoore13)):

## Properties


* The [[character group]] of a torus $T^n$ is isomorphic to its [[fundamental group]], which is $\mathbb{Z}^n$. See also at _[[Pontryagin duality]]_ and at _[[moduli space of flat connections]]_.
