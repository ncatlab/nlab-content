## Definition ##

An object $X$ in a category $C$ with a [[zero object]] $0$ is __simple__ if there are precisely two [[subobjects]] of $X$: $0$ and $X$. 

Note that $0$ itself is *not* simple, as it has only *one* subobject.  It is [[too simple to be simple]].

In [[constructive mathematics]], we want to phrase the definition as: a subobject of $X$ is $0$ if and only if it is not $X$.

In an [[abelian category]] $C$, every morphism between simple objects is either a zero morphism or an isomorphism. If $C$ is also enriched in finite-dimensional vector spaces over an algebraically closed field, it follows that $\hom(X, Y)$ has dimension 0 or 1. 

## Examples ##

* In the category [[Vect]] of [[vector spaces]] over some field $k$, the irreducible objects are precisely the [[line]]s: 1-dimensional vector spaces, i.e. $k$ itself, up to [[isomorphism]].

* For $G$ a [[group]] and $Rep(G)$ its category of [[representations]], the simple objects are the [[irreducible representations]].

* A [[simple ring]] is *not* a simple object in [[Ring]] (which doesn\'t have a zero object anyway); instead it is a ring $R$ that is a simple in its category of [[bimodules]].
