An object $X$ in a category $C$ with a [[zero object]] $0$ is __simple__ if there are precisely two [[subobject]]s of $X$: $0$ and $X$. 

Note that $0$ itself is *not* simple, as it has only *one* subobject.  This is similar to the issues discussed at [[connected space]].

In [[constructive mathematics]], we want to phrase the definition as: a subobject of $X$ is $0$ if and only if it is not $X$.
