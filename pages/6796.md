## Definition

In [[gauge theory]] of higher abelian [[Yang-Mills theory]] type, where field configurations on some manifold $X$ are [[circle n-bundles with connection]] $\nabla$, the **magnetic flux** of the field configuration through a $(n+1)$-[[dimension]]al closed manifold $\Sigma \hookrightarrow X$ is 

$$
  \Phi_\sigma(\nabla) = \int_\Sigma F_\nabla
  \,,
$$

where $F_\nabla$ is the [[curvature]] $(n+1)$-form. 

## Properties

If $\Sigma$ is contractible in $X$, hence if there is a $\hat \Sigma \hookrightarrow X$ such whose [[boundary]] is $\partial \hat \Sigma = \Sigma$  then this is the (higher) [[magnetic charge]] enclosed by $\Sigma$.
