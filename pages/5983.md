## Idea

A _differential function complex_ ([HopkinsSinger](#HopkinsSinger)) is an explicit [[cocycle]] model for _generalized_ [[differential cohomology]], hence for differential refinements of [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] theories:

roughly, given a [[spectrum]] $E$ [[Brown representability|representing]] a given [[cohomology theory]], its _differential function complex_ over any given [[smooth manifold]] $U$ is the [[simplicial set]] whose $k$-[[simplices]] are triples consisting of

* a [[continuous function]] $f : U \times \Delta^k \to E_{n}$;

* a smooth [[differential form]] $\omega$ on $U \times \Delta^k$ whose corresponding real cohomology class (under the [[de Rham theorem]]) is that of the pullback of the real cohomology classes of $E$ along $f$;

* an explict [[coboundary]] in real cohomology exhibiting this fact.

(More precisely, in order for this construction to yield not just a single [[simplicial set]] (which will be a [[Kan complex]]) but a suitable [[spectrum]] object, there are conditons on the dependency of $\omega$ on the [[tangent vector]]s to the [[simplex]].)

When applied to the [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum]] $K\mathbb{Z}$ this construction reproduces, on cohomology classes, [[ordinary differential cohomology]]. Applied to the [[classifying space]] $B U$ of [[topological K-theory]] it gives [[differential K-theory]]. 


## Definitions

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

For $V = V^\bullet$ a [[graded vector space]] over the [[real number]]s set

* for $E$ a [[topological space]]:

  $$
    C^\bullet(E, V)^n := \oplus_{i + j = n} C^i(E, V^j)
  $$

* and so on

### Differential functions

+-- {: .num_defn #DifferentialFunctions}
###### Definition

For 

* $E$ a [[topological space]];

* $\iota \in Z^n(E,\mathbb{R})$ a [[cocycle]] on $E$ for real-valued [[singular cohomology]] on $E$,

a **differential function** on a smooth [[manifold]] $U$ with values in $(E,\iota)$ is a triple $(c,h,\omega)$ with

* $c : U \to E$ a continuous map;

* $\omega \in \Omega^n(S)$ a smooth [[differential form]] on $S$;

* $h \in C^{n-1}(U,\mathbb{R})$ a cochain in real cohomology on (the topological space underlying) $U$;

such that in the [[abelian group]] $Z^n(S,\mathbb{R})$ of singular cochains the equation

$$
  \omega = c^*\iota + \delta h
$$

holds, where 

* $\omega$ is here regarded  as a singular cochain (that sends a chain to the integral of $\omega$ over it, as discussed at [[de Rham theorem]]), 

* $\delta$ denotes the coboundary operator,(the [[Moore complex]] differential of the [[singular simplicial complex]]).

=--

This is ([HopkinsSinger, def.4.1](#HokinsSinger)).

In words this is: a continuous map to the topological space together with a _smooth_ refinement of the pullback of the chosen singular cochain.

### Differential function complexes

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For 

* $E$ be a [[topological space]] and 

* $\iota \in Z^n(E,\mathbb{R})$ a [[cocycle]] on $E$ for real-valued [[singular cohomology]] on $X$,

* $U$ a [[smooth manifold]],

the **differential function complex** 

$$
  (E,\iota)^U
$$ 

of all differential functions $S \to (X,\iota)$ is the [[simplicial set]] whose $k$-[[simplices]] are differential functions, def, \ref{DifferentialFunctions}

$$
  U \times \Delta^k_{Top} \to (E,\iota)
  \,.
$$

=--


For applications one needs certain sub-complex of this, filtered by the number of legs that $\omega$ has along the 
simplices.

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

For $s \in \mathbb{N}$ write

* $filt_s \Omega^\bullet(U \times \Delta^k)$

  for the sub-simplicial set of differential forms that vanish when evaluated on more than $s$ [[vector field]]s tangent to the [[simplex]];

* $filt_s (X,\iota)^S \subset (X,\iota)^S$

  for the sub-simplicial set of those differential functions whose differential form component is in $filt_s \Omega^\bullet(U \times \Delta^k)$.


=--

This is ([HopkinsSinger, def. 4.5](#HopkinsSinger)).

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

The complex $filt_s (E,\iota)^U$ is (up to equivalence, of course) the [[homotopy pullback]]

$$
  \array{
    (E,\iota)^U &\to& \Omega^n_{cl}(U \times \Delta^\bullet, \mathcal{V})
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    Sing E^U &\to& Z^\bullet(U \times \Delta^bullet, \mathcal{V})
  }
$$

in [[sSet]] equipped with its standard [[model structure on simplicial sets]].

## Properties

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The [[simplicial homotopy group]]s of $filt_0 \Omega^n_{cl}(S \times \Delta^\bullet_{Diff})$ are 

$$
  \pi_k filt_0 \Omega^n_{cl}(S \times \Delta^\bullet_{Diff})
  =
  \left\{
    \array{
       \Omega^n_{cl}(S) & | k = 0
       \\
       0 & | k \gt 0
    }
  \right\}
  \,.
$$

The homotopy groups of $Z^n(S \times\Delta^\bullet, \mathbb{R})$ are

$$
  \pi_k Z^n(S \times\Delta^\bullet, \mathbb{R})
  = 
  H^{n-k}(S)
  \,.
$$

This appears as [HopkinsSinger, p. 36 and corollary D15](#HopkinsSinger) .



## Examples

### Line bundles with connection


Let $X = \mathcal{B} U(1) \simeq K(\mathbb{Z},2)$ be the [[Eilenberg-MacLane space]] that is the [[classifying space]] for $U(1)$-[[principal bundle]]s. It carries the canonical [[cocycle]] $\iota := Id : \mathcal{B}U(1) \to \mathcal{B}U(1) \simeq K(\mathbb{Z},2)$ representing in $H^2(X,\mathbb{Z})$ the class of the universal complex [[line bundle]] $L \to X$ on $X$.

Accordingly, for $c : S\to \mathcal{B}U(1)$ a continuous map, we have the corresponding line bundle $c^* L$ on $S$. 

One checks (...details...Example 2.7 in HopSin) that a refinement of $c$ to a differential function $(c,\omega,h)$ corresponds to equipping $c^* L$ with a [[connection on a bundle|smooth connection]].

Now consider $((c,\omega,h) \to (c',\omega', h')) \in filt_0  (\mathcal{B}U(1),Id)^S$ a morphism between two such $(\mathcal{B}U(1),Id)$-differential functions. By definition this is now a $U(1)$-principal bundle $\hat L$ with connection on $S \times \Delta^i_{Diff}$, whose curvature form $\hat \omega \in \Omega^2(S \times \Delta^1_{Diff})$ is of the form $g \cdot \tilde \omega$, where $\tilde \omega$ is a 2-form on $S$ and $g$ is a smooth function on $\Delta^1_{Diff}$, both pulled back to $S \times \Delta^1_{Diff}$ and multiplied there.

But since $\hat \omega$ is necessarily _closed_ it follows with $d (g \wedge \tilde \omega) = d t \frac{\partial g}{\partial t} \wedge \tilde \omega + g \wedge d_{S} \tilde \omega$ that $g$ is actually constant. 

This means that that the parallel transoport of the connection $\hat \nabla$ on $S \times \Delta^1_{Diff}$ induces a insomorphism between the two line bundles on $S$ over the endpoints of $S \times \Delta^1_{Diff}$ that respects the connections.
