This entry is about the book

* [[William Dwyer]], [[Philip Hirschhorn]], [[Daniel Kan]], [[Jeff Smith]],

  **Homotopy Limit Functors on Model Categories
and Homotopical Categories**

  Mathematical Surveys and Monographs **113**

  AMS 2004

  [ISBN: 978-1-4704-1340-8](https://bookstore.ams.org/surv-113-s)

  [pdf](http://dodo.pdmi.ras.ru/~topology/books/dhks.pdf)

on the theory of [[homotopical categories]] and [[model categories]] -- a presentation of [[(∞,1)-categories]] --, their  [[simplicial localization]]/[[homotopy categories]] and [[derived functors]] such as [[homotopy limit]] functors.

A historically important early manuscript draft of this book is

* [[William G. Dwyer]], [[Philip S. Hirschhorn]], [[Daniel M. Kan]], [[Model Categories and More General Abstract Homotopy Theory]], [PDF](https://web.math.rochester.edu/people/faculty/doug/otherpapers/dhk.pdf)

The draft serves as an original reference for the [[Kan recognition theorem]] (in §II.8) and the [[Kan transfer theorem]] (in §II.9),
as well as [[cofibrantly generated model categories]] (in Chapter II).
This material did not make it to the book.

Furthermore, this draft originates the modern definition of a [[model category]] (in §I.1.2), modifying the original definition of closed model category by [[Quillen]] by replacing finite (co)limits with small (co)limits and requiring factorizations to be functorial.
