Consider the equation
$$ a x ^ 2 + b x + c = 0 ,$$
which we wish to solve for $x$.  The coefficients $a,b,c$ are commonly taken from an [[algebraically closed field]] $K$ of [[characteristic]] $0$, such as the field $\mathbb{C}$ of [[complex numbers]], although any quadratically closed field whose characteristic is not $2$ would work just as well.  Alternatively, the coefficients can be taken from a [[real closed field]] $K$, such the field $\mathbb{R}$ of [[real numbers]]; then the solutions belong to $K[\mathrm{i}]$.  (Note that $\mathbb{R}[i]$ is simply $\mathbb{C}$ again.)  More generally, starting from any [[integral domain]] $K$ whose characteristic is not zero, the solutions belong to some [[splitting field]] of $K$.

Explicitly, the solutions are usually given by the __quadratic formula__
\[ \label{usual} x_\pm = \frac { - b \pm \sqrt { b ^ 2 - 4 a c } } { 2 a } ,\]
which works as long as $a \ne 0$.  There is also an __alternate quadratic formula__
\[ \label{alt} x_\pm = \frac { 2 c } { - b \mp \sqrt { b ^ 2 - 4 a c } } ,\]
which may be obtained from (eq:usual) by rationalising the numerator; this works as long as $c \ne 0$.  (Note that $\pm$ and $\mp$ appear here simply to indicate the two square roots of the determinant $b^2 - 4ac$ and how they correspond to the two solutions $x_\pm$; we do not need to have a [[function]] $\sqrt$ which always chooses a 'principal' square root.)

These two formulas can reconciled in the [[projective line]] of $K$.  As long as $(a,b,c) \ne (0,0,0)$, there are two solutions (which might happen to be equal) in the projective line.  If $a = 0$, then one of these solutions is $\infty$, and (eq:usual) correctly gives us that solution (as long as $b \ne 0$) for one choice of square root, although it gives $0/0$ for the other choice.  Similarly, (eq:alt) correctly gives us $x = 0$ when $c = 0$ and $b \ne 0$, but it does not give us the other root when $c = 0$.  Note that if $a,c = 0$ but $b \ne 0$, then (eq:usual) gives us one root ($\infty$) while (eq:alt) gives us the other ($0$).

So in general, we should be given $a \ne 0$, $b \ne 0$, or $c \ne 0$ for a nondegenerate equation.  If $a \ne 0$, then we use (eq:usual); if $c \ne 0$, then we use (eq:alt).  Finally, if $b \ne 0$, then we use both; each root will be successfully given by at least one formula for some choice of square root of $b^2 - 4ac$.

When the coefficients come from an [[ordered field]] $K$ (which we assume real closed), then we can write down a formula specially for the case when $b \ne 0$.  This is the __numerical analysts\' quadratic formula__
\[ \label{numanal} \begin {gathered}
   x_0 = \frac { - b - \hat{b} \sqrt { b ^ 2 - 4 a c } } { 2 a } ;\\
   x_1 = \frac { 2 c } { - b - \hat{b} \sqrt { b ^ 2 - 4 a c } }
\end {gathered} \]
In this formula, $\hat{b}$ is the sign ${|b|}/b$ of $b$; also, we must choose a nonnegative principal square root, so that $\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} \lt 0$ in $K$ is avoided (and thus the common numerator of $x_0$ and denominator of $x_1$ is nonzero even if not imaginary).  Despite the name, this formula is not sufficient for all purposes in numerical analysis; one still needs all three formulas and chooses between them based on whether $a \ne 0$, $b \ne 0$, or $c \ne 0$ is best established.
