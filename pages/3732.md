## Definition (Experimental)

Given [[categories]] $C$ and $D$, a pair of [[functors]] $F:C\to D$ and $G:D\to C$ form an **adjunction** if for any morphism $f:x\to y$ in $C$, there are morphisms 
$$G\circ F(x)\to y$$
and
$$G\circ F(y)\to x$$
such that the following diagram commutes
$$
 \array{
  x &\stackrel{f}{\to}& y
  \\
  \downarrow && \downarrow
  \\
  G\circ F(y) 
  &\stackrel{G\circ F(f)}{\leftarrow}&
  G\circ F(x)
 }.
$$


## Response from Toby

You need to say more than just that *there are* morphisms that make these diagrams commute.  Whether $F \vdash G$ is an adjunction is not actually a property but a structure; we need to say *how* they are an adjunction.  That is, you have to pick the family of morphism $G(F(x)) \to y$ in advance.

But then you can make it work, I believe ... although I\'m pretty sure that you need more commutative diagrams than the one that you\'ve drawn.  That is, an __adjunction__ $\eta$ from $F$ to $G$ consists of a family of maps $\eta_f\colon G(F(x)) \to y$, one for each morphism $f\colon x \to y$, such that

*  a bunch of diagrams commute.

I have to think about whether this works and what diagrams you need.
