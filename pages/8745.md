A form of [[PBW theorem]] says that the symmetric algebra and the universal algebra of a Lie algebra $g$ are isomorphic as vector spaces (in fact coalgebras and $g$-modules). However this is not an isomorphism of algebras. One can compose the PBW isomorphism with an additional automorphism to get an isomorphism of vector spaces which restricts to isomorphism of __algebras__ when restricted to the subalgebras of $g$-invariant functions. 

The original proof by Duflo is rather case by case, using the structure theory of Lie algebras. Kontsevich in 1998 gave a new proof which generalizes to some geometric situations in deformation quantization.
