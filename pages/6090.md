## Idea

In [[quantum field theory]] a _[[scattering amplitude]]_ or _scattering matrix_, usually just _S-matrix_ for short, encodes the [[probability amplitudes]] for scatterings processes of [[particles]] off each other.

### General idea

Every [[Lagrangian field theory|Lagrangian]] [[perturbative quantum field theory]] has an S-matrix associated with its (after [[renormalization]]), usually thought of as a [[perturbation series]] over [[Feynman diagrams]] extracted from the [[Lagrangian density]]. The rigorous construction of this as an [[operator-valued distribution]] is the content of _[[causal perturbation theory]]_ ([Epstein-Glaser 73](#EpsteinGlaser73)).

But there are also S-matrices not arising from a local field theory, for instance the [[string scattering amplitudes]].

There have been attempts to _define_ [[perturbative quantum field theory]] by directly [[axiom|axiomatizing]] properties of the S-matrix, without requiring concepts of [[field (physics)|fields]] in [[spacetime]]. This perspective goes back to ([Heisenberg 43](#Heisenberg43)) and was vocally promoted in [[Geoffrey Chew]]'s "bootstrap program" (a textbook account is in [Eden-Ladshoff-Olive-Polkinhorne 66](#EdenLadshoffOlivePolkinhorne66)).

In the [[field theory]]-picture the crucial condition on the S-matrix is its [[causal additivity]] (def. \ref{LagrangianFieldTheoryPerturbativeScattering} below) which reflects the [[microcausality]] of [[quantum observables]] (prop. \ref{PerturbativeQuantumObservablesIsLocalnet} below), whence the name "[[causal perturbation theory]]".

{#TheAnalyticSMatrix} This [[causality]] of the S-matrix, when understood in terms of underlying [[spacetime]] and [[field (physics)|fields]], is supposed to be detected more abstractly by the S-matrix being a suitable [[analytic function]] of the [[wave vectors]] of the scattering asymptotic states ([Newton 82, 10.3.3](#Newton82), [Arkani-Hamed et al. 06](#AAHDNR06)), often refereed to via "dispersion relations" (e.g. [Eden-Ladshoff-Olive-Polkinhorne 66 (1.1.1)-(1.1.5)](#EdenLadshoffOlivePolkinhorne66), [Gribov 69, 1.1.2](#Gribov69)). Since thereby analyticity is recognized as the crucial property of the S-matrix in the spacetime/field-independent axiomatization, this is often referred to as "the analytic S-matrix" (e.g. [Eden-Ladshoff-Olive-Polkinhorne 66](#EdenLadshoffOlivePolkinhorne66)). More specifically [[microcausality]] is what induces "crossing symmetry" of the S-matrix ([Weinberg 95, section 10.8](#Weinberg95)).

The perception of the nature of the S-matrix as a primary or derived concept in the foundations of quantum field theory has a convoluted (and ongoing) history, see [below](#History).

### The S-matrix bootstrap

From [this Physics.SE comment](https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/17973/5603) by [[Ron Maimon]]:

The idea of the S-matrix "bootstrap" is that one may compute the S-matrix directly from suitable axioms without using a [[local field theory|local]] [[quantum field theory]] involving [[field (physics)|fields]] on [[spacetime]]. In order for the theory to be interesting, the S-matrix should obey certain properties abstracted away from field theory

* It should be unitary
* It should be Lorentz invariant
* It should be crossing invariant: this means that the antiparticle scattering
should be described by the analytic continuation of the particle scattering
* It should obey the Landau property--- that all singularities of scattering are poles and cuts corresponding to exchange of collections of real particles on shell.
* It should obey ([[Stanley Mandelstam|Mandelstam]]) analyticity: the amplitude should be writable as an integral over the imaginary part of the cut discontinuity from production of physical particles. Further, this cut discontinuity itself can be expanded in terms of another cut discontinuity (these are the mysterious then and still mysterious now double dispersion relations of Mandelstam).

This is a sketchy summary, because each of these conditions is involved. The unitarity condition in particular, is very difficult, because it is so nonlinear. The only practical way to solve it is in a perturbation series which starts with weakly interacting nearly stable particles (described by poles of the S-matrix) which exchange each other (the exchange picture is required by crossing, and the form of the scattering is fixed by the Landau and Mandelstam analyticity, once you know the spectrum).

The "Bootstrap property" is then the following heuristic idea, which is included in the above formal relations:

* The particles and interactions which emerge as the spectrum of the S-matrix from the scattering of states, including their binding together into bound states, should be the same spectrum of particles that come in ias in-states.

This is a heuristic idea, because it is only saying that the S-matrix is consistent, and the formal consistency relations are those above. But the bootstrap was a slogan that implied that all the consistency conditions were not yet discovered, and there might be more.

This idea was very inspirational to many great people in the 1960s, because it was an approach to strong interactions that could accommodate non-field theories of infinitely many particle types of high spin, without postulating constituent particles (like quarks and gluons).

### Regge theory

Continuing with [this Physics.SE comment](https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/17973/5603) by [[Ron Maimon]]:


The theory above doesn't get you anywhere without the following additional stuff. If you don't do this, you end up starting with a finite number of particles and interactions, and then you end up in effective field theory land. The finite-number-of-particles version of S-matrix theory is a dead end, or at least, it is equivalent to effective field theory, and this was understood in the late 1960s by Weinberg, and others, and this led S-matrix theory to die. This was the road the Chew travelled on, and the end of this road must be very personally painful to him.

But there is another road for S-matrix theory which is much more interesting, so that Chew should not be disheartened. You need to know that the scattering amplitude is analytic in the angular momentum of the exchanged particles, so that the particles lie on Regge trajectories, which give their angular momentum as a function of their mass squared, s.

Where the Regge trajectories hit an integer angular momentum, you see a particle. The trajectory interpolates the particle mass-squared vs. angular momentum graph, and it gives the asymptotic scattering caused by exchanging all these particles _together_. This scattering can be softer than the exchange of any one of these particles, because exchanging a particle of high spin necessarily has very singular scattering amplitudes at high energy. The Regge trajectory cancels out this growth with an infinite series of higher particles which soften the blowup, and lead to a power-law near-beam scattering at an angle which shrinks to zero as the energy goes to infinity in a way determined by the shape of the trajectory.

So the Regge bootstrap adds the following conditions

* All the particles in the theory lie on Regge trajectories, and the scattering of these particles is by Regge theory.

This condition is the most stringent, because you can't deform a pure Regge trajectory by adding a single particle--- you have to add new trajectories. The following restriction was suggested by experiment

* The Regge trajectories are linear in s

This was suggested by Chew and Frautschi from the resonances known in 1960! The straight lines mostly had two points. The next condition is also ad-hoc and experimental

* The Regge slope is universal (for mesons), it's the same for all the trajectories.

There are also "pomerons" in this approach which are not mesons, which have a different Regge slopem but ignore this for now.

Finally, there is the following condition, which was experimentally motivated, but has derivations by Mandelstam and others from more theoretical foundations (although this is S-matrix theory, it doesn't have axioms, so derivation is a loose word).

* The exchange of trajectories is via the s-channel or the t-channel, but not both. It is double counting to exchange the same trajectories in both channels.

These conditions essentially uniquely determine Veneziano's amplitude and bosonic string theory. Adding Fermion trajectories requires Ramond style supersymmetry, and then the road to string theory is to reinterpret all these conditions in the string picture which emerges.

String theory incorporates and gives concrete form to all the boostrap ideas, so much so that anyone doing bootstrap today is doing string theory, especially since AdS/CFT showed why the bootstrap is relevant to gauge theories like QCD in the first place.

The highlight of Regge theory is the Reggeon calculus, a full diagrammatic formalism, due to Gribov, for calculating the exchange of pomerons in a perturbation framework. This approach inspired a 2d parton picture of QCD which is studied heavily by several people, notably, Gribov, Lipatov, Feynman (as part of his parton program), and more recently Rajeev. Nearly every problem here is open and interesting.

For an example of a reasearch field which (partly) emerged from this, one of the major motivations for taking PT quantum mechanics seriously was the strange non-Hermitian form of the Reggeon field theory Hamiltonian.

### Pomerons and Reggeon Field theory

Further from [this Phyics.SE comment](https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/17973/5603) by [[Ron Maimon]]:

The main success of this picture is describing near-beam scattering, or diffractive scattering, at high energies. The idea here is that there is a Regge trajectory which is called the pomeron, which dominates high energy scattering, and which has no quantum numbers. This means that any particle will exchange the pomeron at high energies, so that p-pbar and p-p total cross sections will become equal.

This idea is spectacularly confirmed by mid 90's measurements of total p-p and p-pbar cross sections, and in a better political climate, this would have won some boostrap theorists a Nobel prize. Instead, it is never mentioned.

The pomeron in string theory becomes the closed string, which includes the graviton, which couples universally to stress energy. The relation between the closed string and the QCD pomeron is the subject of active research, associated with the names of Lipatov, Polchinski, Tan, and collaborators.

Regge scattering also predicts near beam scattering amplitudes from the sum of the appropriate trajectory function you can exchange. These predictions have been known to roughly work since the late 1960s.


## Details

### In quantum mechanics
 {#InQuantumMechanics}

In [[quantum mechanics]], let $\mathcal{H}$ be some [[Hilbert space]] and let

$$
  H = H_{free} + V
$$

be an Hermitian operator, thought of as a [[Hamiltonian]], decomposed as the [[sum]] of a free part ([[kinetic energy]]) and an interaction part ([[potential energy]]).

For example for a  [[non-relativistic particle]] of [[mass]] $m$ propagating on the [[line]] subject to a [[potential energy]] $V_{pot} \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, then $\mathcal{H} = L^2(\mathbb{R})$ is the Hilbert space space of [[square integrable functions]] and

$$
  H
   =
  \underset{H_{free}}{\underbrace{\tfrac{- \hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial^2 x}}}
    +
  V
  \,,
$$

where $V = V_{pot}(x)$ is the operator of multiplying square integrable functions with the given potential energy function.

Now for

$$
  \array{
    \mathbb{R} &\overset{\vert \psi (-)\rangle }{\longrightarrow}& \mathcal{H}
   \\
   t &\mapsto& \vert \psi(t) \rangle
  }
$$

a one-parameter family of [[quantum states]], the [[Schrödinger equation]] for this state reads

$$
  \frac{d}{d t} \vert \psi(t) \rangle
  \;=\;
  \tfrac{1}{i \hbar} H \vert \psi\rangle
  \,.
$$

It is easy to solve this [[differential equation]] formally via its [[Green function]]: for $\vert \psi \rangle \in \mathcal{H}$ any state, then the unique solution $\vert \psi(-) \rangle$ to the Schr&#246;dinger equation subject to $\vert \psi(0) \rangle = \vert \psi \rangle$ is

$$
  \vert \psi(t)\rangle_S \coloneqq \exp( \tfrac{t}{i \hbar} H ) \vert \psi \rangle
  \,.
$$

(One says that this is the solution "in the [[Schrödinger picture]]", whence the subscript.)

However, if $H$ is sufficiently complicated, it may still be very hard to extract from this expression a more explicit formula for $\vert \psi(t) \rangle$, such as, in the example of the free particle on the line, its expression as a function ("[[wave function]]") of $x$ and $t$.

But assume that the analogous expression for $H_{free}$ alone is well understood, hence that the operator

$$
  U_{S,free}(t_1, t_2) \coloneqq \exp\left({\tfrac{t_2 - t_1}{i \hbar} H_{free}}\right)
$$

is sufficiently well understood. The "[[interaction picture]]" is a way to decompose the Schr&#246;dinger equation such that its dependence on $V$ gets separated from its dependence on $H_{free}$ in a way that admits to treat $H_{int}$ in [[perturbation theory]].

Namely define analogously

\[
  \label{StateInTheInteractionPicture}
  \begin{aligned}
    \vert \psi(t)\rangle_I
     &\coloneqq
     \exp\left({\tfrac{- t}{i \hbar} H_{free}}\right) \vert \psi(t)\rangle_S
    \\
    & = \exp\left({\tfrac{- t}{i \hbar} H_{free}}\right)
        \exp\left({ \tfrac{+ t}{i \hbar} H} \right)\vert \psi \rangle
    \\
    & = \exp\left({\tfrac{- t}{i \hbar} H_{free}}\right)
        \exp\left({\tfrac{t}{i \hbar} H_{free} + \tfrac{t}{i \hbar} V} \right)\vert \psi \rangle   \end{aligned}
  \,.
\]

This is called the solution of the Schr&#246;dinger equation "in the [[interaction picture]]", whence the subscript. Its definition may be read as the result of propagating the actual solution $\vert \psi(-)\rangle_S$ at time $t$ back to time $t = 0$, but using just the free Hamiltonian, hence with "the interaction switched off".

Notice that if the operator $V$ were to commute with $H_{free}$ (which it does not in all relevant examples) then we would simply have $\vert \psi(t)\rangle_I = \exp( \tfrac{t}{i \hbar } V ) \vert \psi\rangle$, hence then the solution (eq:StateInTheInteractionPicture) in the [[interaction picture]] would be the result of "propagating" the initial conditions using _only_ the interaction. Now since $V$ may not be assumed to commute with $H_{free}$, the actual form of $\vert \psi(-) \rangle_{I}$ is more complicated. But _infinitesimally_ it remains true that $\vert \psi(-)\rangle_I$ is propagated this way, not by the plain operator $V$, though, but by $V$ viewed in the [[Heisenberg picture]] of the free theory. This is the content of the differential equation (eq:DifferentialEquationInInteractionPicture) below.

But first notice that this will indeed be useful: If an explicit expression for the "state in the [[interaction picture]]" (eq:StateInTheInteractionPicture) is known, then the assumption that also the operator $\exp\left({\tfrac{t}{i \hbar} H_{free}}\right)$ is sufficiently well understood implies that the actual solution

$$
  \vert \psi(t) \rangle_S = \exp\left({\tfrac{t}{i \hbar} H_{free}}\right) \vert \psi(t) \rangle_I
$$

is under control. Hence the question now is how to find $\vert \psi(-)\rangle_I$ given its value at some time $t$. (It is conventional to consider this for $t \to \pm \infty$, see (eq:SMatrixInQuantumMechanics) below.)

Now it is clear from the construction and using the [[product law]] for [[differentiation]], that $\vert \psi(-)\rangle_S$ satisfies the following [[differential equation]] ("[[Schrödinger equation]] in [[interaction picture]]"):

\[
  \label{DifferentialEquationInInteractionPicture}
  \frac{d}{d t} \vert \psi(t) \rangle
  \;=\;
  V_I(t) \vert \psi(t)\rangle_I
  \,,
\]

where

$$
  V_I(t)
    \coloneqq
  \exp\left( -\tfrac{t}{i \hbar} H_{free} \right)
    V
  \exp\left( +\tfrac{t}{i \hbar} H_{free} \right)
$$

is known as the [[interaction]] term $V$ "viewed in the [[interaction picture]]". But in fact this is just $V$ "viewed in the [[Heisenberg picture]]", but for the _free_ theory. By our running assumption that the free theory is well understood, also $V_I(t)$ is well understood, and hence all that remains now is to find a sufficiently concrete solution to equation (eq:DifferentialEquationInInteractionPicture). This is the heart of working in the interaction picture.

Solutions to equations of the "[[parallel transport]]"-type such as (eq:DifferentialEquationInInteractionPicture) are given by [[time-ordered product|time-ordering]] of Heisenberg picture operators, denoted $T$, applied to the naive exponential solution as above. This is known as the _[[Dyson formula]]_:

$$
  \label{DysonFormula}
  \vert \psi(t)\rangle_I
  \;=\;
  T\left(
    \exp\left(
      \int_{t_0}^t
        V_I(t)
        \tfrac{d t}{i \hbar}
    \right)
  \right)
  \vert \psi(t_0)\rangle
  \,.
$$

Here [[time-ordered product|time-ordering]] means

$$
  T( V_I(t_1) V_I(t_2) )
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \left\{
    \array{
      V_I(t_1) V_I(t_2) &\vert& t_1 \geq t_2
      \\
      V_I(t_2) V_I(t_1) &\vert& t_2 \geq t_1
    }
  \right.
  \,.
$$

Beware the conventional abuse of notation here: Strictly speaking time ordering acts on the [[tensor algebra]] spanned by the $\{V_I(t)\}_{t \in \mathbb{R}}$ and has to be _followed_ by taking tensor products to actual products.

In applications to [[scattering]] processes one is interest in prescribing the [[quantum state]]/[[wave function]] far in the past, hence for $t \to - \infty$, and computing its form far in the future, hence for $t \to \infty$.

The operator that sends such "asymptotic ingoing-states" $\vert \psi(-\infty) \rangle_I$ to "asymptic outgoing states" $\vert \psi(+ \infty) \rangle_I$ is hence the [[limit of a sequence|limit]]

\[
  \label{SMatrixInQuantumMechanics}
  \mathcal{S}(V_I)
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \underset{t \to \infty}{\lim}
  T\left(
    \exp\left(
      \int_{-t}^t
        V_I(t)
        \tfrac{d t}{i \hbar}
    \right)
  \right)
  \,.
\]

This limit (if it exists) is called the _scattering matrix_ or _S-matrix_, for short.

For example if $V_{I,1}$ and $V_{I,2}$ are two [[interactions]] such that the [[support]] in [[time]] of $V_{I,1}$
is _after_ the support of $V_{I,2}$:

$$
  \left\{
  \array{
    \left(t \gt t_0 \right) &\Rightarrow& V_{I,2} = 0
    \\
    \left(t \lt t_0 \right) &\Rightarrow& V_{I,1} = 0
  }
  \right.
$$

then, assuming the S-matrix for $V_{I,1}$, $V_{I,2}$ and $V_I \coloneqq V_{I,1} + V_{I,2}$ exists, the [[Dyson formula]] (eq:DysonFormula)
implies the "[[causal factorization]]"

$$
  \label{IntegralVersionSchroedingerEquationInInteractionPicture}
  \mathcal{S}(V_{I,1} + V_{I,2})
  \;=\;
  \mathcal{S}(V_{I,1}) \, \mathcal{S}(V_{I,2})
$$

Conversely, decomposing any $V_I(t)$ with the [[step function]] $\Theta$ as

$$
  V_I(t)
    \;=\;
  \underset{ \coloneqq V_{I,1}(t) }{\underbrace{V_I(t) \Theta(t-t_0)}}
   \;+\;
  \underset{ \coloneqq V_{I,2}(t) }{\underbrace{V_I(t)\Theta(t_0 - t)}}
$$

then this [[causal factorization]]-relation may be understood as the integral version of the
"[[Schrödinger equation]] in the [[interaction picture]]" (eq:DifferentialEquationInInteractionPicture).

It is this "integral-version of the [[Schrödinger equation]] in the [[interaction picture]]" (eq:IntegralVersionSchroedingerEquationInInteractionPicture) that has a fairly
evident generalization from [[quantum mechanics]] to [[relativistic field theory|relativistic]] [[perturbative quantum field theory]]
in the form of _[[causal perturbation theory]]_, def. \ref{LagrangianFieldTheoryPerturbativeScattering} below, see remark \ref{DysonCausalFactorization} below that.




### In perturbative relativistic Lagrangian QFT -- Causal perturbation theory
 {#InCausalPerturbationTheory}


In [[perturbative algebraic quantum field theory]] the broad structure of the [[interaction picture]] in [[quantum mechanics]] ([above](#InQuantumMechanics)) remains a very good guide, but various technical details have to be generalized with due care:

1. The algebra of operators in the [[Heisenberg picture]] of the free theory becomes the _[[Wick algebra]]_ of the [[free field theory]] (taking into account "normal ordering" of field operators) defined on _[[microcausal functionals]]_ built from [[operator-valued distributions]] with constraints on their [[wave front set]].

1. The [[time-ordered products]] in the [[Dyson formula]] have to be refined to [[causal locality|causally ordered]] products and the resulting product at coincident points has to be defined by [[point-extension of distributions]] -- the freedom in making this choice is the [[renormalization]] freedom ("conter-terms").

1. The sharp interaction cutoff in the [[Dyson formula]] that is hidden in the integration over $[t_0,t]$ has to be smoothed out by [[adiabatic switching]] of the interaction (making the whole S-matrix an [[operator-valued distribution]]).

Together these three points are taken care of by the axiomatization of the "[[adiabatic switching|adiabatically switched]] [[S-matrix]]" according to **[[causal perturbation theory]]**.






#### Perturbative S-Matrices
 {#PerturbativeSMatrixAndTimeOrderedProducts}

We consider here the [[axioms]] for perturbative S-matrices relative to a fixed [[relativistic field theory|relativistic]] [[free field theory|free]] [[Lagrangian field theory|Lagrangian]] [[quantum field theory|quantum field]] [[vacuum]] (def. \ref{VacuumFree} below) according to _[[causal perturbation theory]]_ (def. \ref{LagrangianFieldTheoryPerturbativeScattering} below).
Since the first of these axioms requires the S-matrix to be a formal sum of [[multilinear map|multi-]][[linear continuous functionals]], it is convenient to impose axioms on these directly: this is the axiomatics for _[[time-ordered products]]_
in def. \ref{TimeOrderedProduct} below. That these latter axioms already imply the former
is the statement of prop. \ref{TimeOrderedProductInducesPerturbativeSMatrix} below. Its proof
requires a close look at the "[[reverse-time ordered products]]" for the inverse S-matrix (def. \ref{ReverseTimeOrderedProduct} below)
and their induced reverse-causal factorization (prop. \ref{ReverseCausalFactorizationOfReverseTimeOrderedProducts} below).

$\,$

In considering [[perturbative QFT]], we are considering [[perturbation theory]] around a fixed [[free field theory|free]]
[[Lagrangian field theory|Lagrangian]] [[quantum field theory]] in a chosen [[Hadamard vacuum state]].
For convenient referencing we collect all the structure and notation that goes into this in the following definition:

+-- {: .num_defn #VacuumFree}
###### Definition
**([[free field theory|free]] [[relativistic field theory|relativistic]] [[Lagrangian field theory|Lagrangian]] [[quantum field theory|quantum field]] [[vacuum]])**

Let

1. $\Sigma$ be a [[spacetime]] (e.g. [[Minkowski spacetime]]);

1. $(E,\mathbf{L})$ a [[free field theory|free]] [[Lagrangian field theory]] ([this def.](A+first+idea+of+quantum+field+theory#FreeFieldTheory)), with [[field bundle]] $E \overset{fb}{\to} \Sigma$;

1. $\mathcal{G} \overset{fb}{\to} \Sigma$ a [[gauge parameter bundle]] for $(E,\mathbf{L})$ ([this def.](A+first+idea+of+quantum+field+theory#GaugeParameters)), with induced [[BRST-complex|BRST]]-[[reduced phase space|reduced]] [[Lagrangian field theory]] $\left( E \times_\Sigma \mathcal{G}[1], \mathbf{L} - \mathbf{L}_{BRST}\right)$ ([this example](A+first+idea+of+quantum+field+theory#LocalOffShellBRSTComplex));

1. $(E_{\text{BV-BRST}}, \mathbf{L}' - \mathbf{L}'_{BRST})$ a [[gauge fixing]] ([this def.](A+first+idea+of+quantum+field+theory#GaugeFixingLagrangianDensity)) with [[graded manifold|graded]] [[BV-BRST formalism|BV-BRST]] [[field bundle]] $E_{\text{BV-BRST}} = T^\ast_{\Sigma}[-1]\left( E\times_\Sigma \mathcal{G}[1] \times_\Sigma A \times_\Sigma A[-1]\right)$ ([this remark](A+first+idea+of+quantum+field+theory#FieldBundleBVBRST));

###### Remark

For the purposes of constructing or defining the Wick algebra, the conditions on $\Delta_H$ or $H$ could be relaxed. Requiring $\Delta_H$ to be an honest [[Wightman propagator]] means that it is a distribution satisfying the [[Hadamard distribution|Hadamard wavefront condition]], as well as addition positivity and normalization requirements. Dropping the positivity and some of the normalization requirements, $\Delta_H$ is then only a _Hadamard parametrix_ for the Wightman propagator. The construction of the Wick algebra with respect to $\Delta_H$ still makes sense, but $:(-):$ can no longer be interpreted as normal ordering with respect to a fixed vacuum state. In fact, in [[locally covariant pAQFT]], the property for $\Delta_H$ to be the Wightman propagator for a state is in conflict with local covariance. On the other hand, there is no problem with selecting a locally covariant Hadamard parametrix $\Delta_H$, which allows the construction or definition of the Wick algebra to be locally covariant.

Being concerned with [[perturbative QFT|perturbation theory]] means mathematically that we consider _[[formal power series]]_

Write

for the space of [[formal power series]] in three formal [[variables]]

1. $\hbar$ ("[[Planck's constant]]"),

1. $g$ ("[[coupling constant]]")

1. $j$ ("[[source field]]")

with  [[coefficients]] in the [[topological vector spaces]] of the [[off-shell]] polynomial [[local observables]] of the [[free field]] theory; similarly for the [[off-shell]] [[microcausal polynomial observables]]:

$$
  PolyObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})_{mc}[ [ \hbar, g, j ] ]
  \;\coloneqq\;

  \,,

  PolyObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})[ [ \hbar, g  ] ]
$$

denotes the subspace for which no powers of $j$ appear, etc.

Accordingly

$$
  C^\infty_{cp}(\Sigma) \langle g \rangle
$$

denotes the be vector space of [[bump functions]] tensored with the vector space spanned by a single copy of $g$.
The elements

$$
  g_{sw} \in C^\infty_{cp}(\Sigma)\langle g \rangle
$$

may be regarded as [[spacetime]]-dependent "[[coupling constants]]" with compact support,
called _[[adiabatic switching|adiabatically switched]] couplings_.

Similarly then

$$
  LocObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})[ [ \hbar, g, j ] ]\langle g , j \rangle
$$

is the subspace of those formal power series that are at least linear in $g$ or $j$ (hence those that vanish if one sets $g,j = 0$ ).
Hence every element of this space may be written in the form

$$
  O
    =
  g S_{int} + j A
  \;\in\;
  LocObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})[ [ \hbar, g, j ] ]\langle g , j \rangle
  \,,
$$

where the notation is to suggest that we will think of the coefficient of $g$ as an ([[adiabatic switching|adiabatically switched]])
[[interaction]] [[action functional]].

In particular for

$$
  \mathbf{L}_{int}
  \;\in\;
  \Omega^{p+1,0}_\Sigma(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})[ [ \hbar , g] ]
$$

a [[formal power series]] in $\hbar$ and $g$ of [[local Lagrangian densities]], thought of as a local [[interaction]] Lagrangian, and if

$$
  g_{sw}
  \;\in\;
  C^\infty_{cp}(\Sigma) \langle g \rangle
$$

is an [[adiabatic switching|adiabatically switched]] coupling as before, then the [[transgression of variational differential forms|transgression]] of the product

$$
  g_{sw} \mathbf{L}_{int}
  \;\in\;
  \Omega^{p+1,0}_{\Sigma,cp}(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})[ [ \hbar ,g ] ]\langle g \rangle

is such an [[adiabatic switching|adiabatically switched]] [[interaction]]

$$
  g S_{int}
  \;=\;
  \tau_\Sigma( g_{sw} \mathbf{L}_{int} )
  \;\in\;
  LocObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})[ [ \hbar, g] ]\langle g \rangle
  \,.
$$

We also consider the space of [[off-shell]] [[microcausal polynomial observables]] of the [[free field theory]] with formal parameters adjoined

$$
  PolyObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})_{mc} ((\hbar)) [ [ g , j] ]

###### Remark
**([[inverse|invertibility]] of the [[S-matrix]])**

The mutliplicative inverse $S(-)^{-1}$ of the perturbative [[S-matrix]] in def. \ref{LagrangianFieldTheoryPerturbativeScattering}
with respect to the [[Wick algebra]]-product indeed exists, so that the list of axioms is indeed well defined: By the axiom "perturbation" this follows with the usual formula for the multiplicative inverse of [[formal power series]] that are non-vanishing in degree 0:

If we write

$$
  \mathcal{S}(g S_{int} + j A) = 1 + \mathcal{D}(g S_{int} + j A)
$$

then

$$
  \label{InfverseOfPerturbativeSMatrix}
  \begin{aligned}
    \left(
      {\, \atop \,}
      \mathcal{S}(g S_{int} + j A)
      {\, \atop \,}
    \right)^{-1}
    &=
    \left(
      {\, \atop \,}
      1 + \mathcal{D}(g S_{int} + j A)
      {\, \atop \,}
    \right)^{-1}
    \\
    & =
    \underoverset{r = 0}{\infty}{\sum}

      {\, \atop \,}
      -\mathcal{D}(g S_{int} + j A)
      {\, \atop \,}
    \right)^r
  \end{aligned}
$$

where the sum does exist in $PolyObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})((\hbar))[ [[ g,j ] ]$, because (by
the axiom "perturbation")
$\mathcal{D}(g S_{int} + j A)$ has vanishing coefficient in zeroth order in the formal parameters $g$ and $j$, so that
only a finite sub-sum of the formal infinite sum contributes in each order in $g$ and $j$.

This expression for the inverse of S-matrix may usefully be re-organized in terms of "rever-time ordered products" (def. \ref{ReverseTimeOrderedProduct} below), see prop. \ref{ReverseTimOrderedProductsGiveReverseSMatrix} below.

Notice that $\mathcal{S}(-g S_{int} - j A )$ is instead the inverse with respect to the [[time-ordered products]] (eq:TimeOrderedProductsInSMatrix) in that

$$
  T( \mathcal{S}(-g S_{int} -  j A ) \,,\, \mathcal{S}(g S_{int} + j A)  )
  \;=\;
  1
  \;=\;
  T( \mathcal{S}(g S_{int} + j A )  \,,\,  \mathcal{S}(-g S_{in} - j A ) )
  \,.
$$

(Since the time-ordered product is, by definition, symmetric in its arguments, the usual formula for the multiplicative inverse of
an [[exponential series]] applies).

###### Remark
**([[interacting field observables]] are [[formal deformation quantization]])**

The [[interacting field observables]] in def. \ref{InteractingFieldObservables} are indeed [[formal power series]] in the formal parameter $\hbar$ ([[Planck's constant]]), as opposed to being more general [[Laurent series]], hence they involve no [[negative number|negative]] powers of $\hbar$ ([Dütsch-Fredenhagen 00, prop. 2 (ii)](interacting+field+observable#DuetschFredenhagen00), [Hawkins-Rejzner 16, cor. 5.2](interacting+field+observable#HawkinsRejzner16)).  This is not immediate, since by def. \ref{LagrangianFieldTheoryPerturbativeScattering} the [[S-matrix]] that they are defined from does involve negative powers of $\hbar$.

It follows in particular that the [[interacting field observables]] have a [[classical limit]] $\hbar \to 0$.

#### Conceptual remarks
 {#RemarksOnCausalPerturbationTheoryAxioms}

The simple axioms for [[S-matrices]] in [[causal perturbation theory]] (def. \ref{LagrangianFieldTheoryPerturbativeScattering}) and hence for [[interacting field observables]] (def. \ref{InteractingFieldObservables}) have a wealth of
implications and consequences. Before discussing these formally below, we here make a few informal remarks meant to put various relevant concepts into perspective:

+-- {: .num_remark #AsymptoticSeriesObservables}
###### Remark
**([[perturbative quantum field theory|perturbative QFT]] and [[asymptotic expansion]] of [[probability amplitudes]])**

Given a perturbative [[S-matrix]] scheme (def. \ref{LagrangianFieldTheoryPerturbativeScattering}), then by remark \ref{FormalPowerSeriesInteractingFieldObservables} the
[[expectation values]] of [[interacting field observables]] (def. \ref{InteractingFieldObservables}) are [[formal power series]]
in the formal parameters $\hbar$ and $g$ (which are interpreted as [[Planck's constant]], and as the [[coupling constant]], respectively):

$$
 \left\langle A_{int} \right\rangle
 \;\in\;
 \mathbb{C}[ [\hbar, g] ]
 \,.
$$

This means that there is _no_ guarantee that these series _[[convergence|converge]]_ for any [[positive real number|positive]]
value of $\hbar$ and/or $g$.
In terms of [[synthetic differential geometry]] this means that in [[perturbative QFT]] the [[deformation]] of the [[classical field theory|classical]] [[free field theory]] by quantum effects (measured by $\hbar$) and [[interactions]] (meaured by $g$) is so very tiny as to actually be [[infinitesimal]]: formal power series may be read as functions on the [[infinitesimal neighbourhood]] in a space of [[Lagrangian field theories]] at the point $\hbar = 0$, $g = 0$.

In fact, a simple argument (due to [Dyson 52](perturbative+quantum+field+theory#Dyson52))
suggests that in realistic field theories these series _never_ converge for _any_ [[positive real number|positive]] value of $\hbar$ and/or $g$. Namely convergence for $g$ would imply a [[positive real number|positive]] _[[radius of convergence]]_ around $g = 0$, which would imply convergence also for $-g$ and even for [[imaginary number|imaginary]] values of $g$, which would however correspond to unstable [[interactions]] for which no converging field theory is to be expected. (See [Helling, p. 4](perturbative+quantum+field+theory#Helling) for the example of [[phi^4 theory]].)

In physical practice one tries to interpret these non-converging [[formal power series]] as _[[asymptotic expansions]]_ of
actual but hypothetical functions in $\hbar, g$, which reflect the actual but hypothetical _[[non-perturbative quantum field theory]]_
that one imagines is being approximated by [[perturbative QFT]] methods. An _[[asymptotic expansion]]_ of a function is a [[power series]] which may no converge, but which has for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ an estimate for how far the [[sum]] of the first $n$ terms in the series may differ from the function being approximated.

For examples such as [[quantum electrodynamics]] and [[quantum chromodynamics]], as in the [[standard model of particle physics]], the truncation of these [[formal power series]] [[scattering amplitudes]] to the first handful of [[loop orders]] in $\hbar$ happens to agree with [[experiment]] (such as at the [[LHC]] collider) to high precision (for [[QED]]) or at least decent precision (for [[QCD]]), at least away from infrared phenomena (see remark \ref{AdiabaticLimit}).

In summary this says that [[perturbative QFT]] is an extremely _coarse_ and restrictive approximation to what should be genuine [[non-perturbative quantum field theory]], while at the same time it happens to match certain experimental observations to remarkable degree, albeit only if some ad-hoc truncation of the resulting power series is considered.

This is strong motivation for going beyond [[perturbative QFT]] to understand and construct genuine [[non-perturbative quantum field theory]]. Unfortunately, this is a wide-open problem, away from toy examples. Not a single [[interacting field theory]] in [[spacetime]] [[dimension]] $\geq 4$ has been non-perturbatively quantized. Already a single aspect of the [[non-perturbative quantum field theory|non-perturbative]] [[quantization of Yang-Mills theory]] (as in [[QCD]]) has famously been advertized as one of the _[Millenium Problems](http://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems/yang%E2%80%93mills-and-mass-gap)_ of our age; and speculation about [[non-perturbative quantum field theory|non-perturbative]] [[quantum gravity]] is the subject of much activity.

Now, as the name indicates, the [[axioms]] of _[[causal perturbation theory]]_ (def. \ref{LagrangianFieldTheoryPerturbativeScattering}) do
_not_ address [[non-perturbative effect|non-perturbative aspects]] of [[non-perturbative field theory]]; the convergence or non-convergence of the [[formal power series]] that are axiomatized by [[Bogoliubov's formula]] (def. \ref{InteractingFieldObservables}) is _not_ addressed by the theory.
The point of the axioms of [[causal perturbation theory]] is to give rigorous mathematical meaning to _everything else_ in [[perturbative QFT]].

=--


+-- {: .num_remark #DysonCausalFactorization}
###### Remark
**([[Dyson series]] and [[Schrödinger equation]] in [[interaction picture]])**

The axiom "[[causal additivity]]" (eq:CausalAdditivity) on an [[S-matrix]] scheme (def. \ref{LagrangianFieldTheoryPerturbativeScattering})
implies immediately this weaker condition:

* ([[causal factorization]])

  For all [[local observables]] $O_1, O_2 \in LocObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})[ [\hbar, h, j] ]\langle g , j\rangle $ we have

  $$
    \left(
       {\, \atop \,}
       supp(O_1) {\vee\!\!\!\wedge} supp(O_2)
       {\, \atop \,}
    \right)
    \;\; \Rightarrow \;\;
    \left(
      {\, \atop \,}
      \mathcal{S}( O_1 + O_2 )
      =
      \mathcal{S}( O_1 ) \, \mathcal{S}( O_2 )
      {\, \atop \,}
   \right)
  $$

(This is the special case of "causal additivity" for $O_0 = 0$, using that  by the axiom "perturbation" (eq:ExponentialSeriesScatteringMatrix) we have $\mathcal{S}(0) = 1$.)

If we now think of $O_1 = g S_{1}$ and $O_2 = g S_2$ themselves as [[adiabatic switching|adiabatically switched]] [[interaction]] [[action functionals]], then this becomes

  $$
    \left(
       {\, \atop \,}
       supp(S_1) {\vee\!\!\!\wedge} supp(S_2)
       {\, \atop \,}
    \right)
    \;\; \Rightarrow \;\;
    \left(
      {\, \atop \,}
      \mathcal{S}( g S_1 + g S_2 )
      =
      \mathcal{S}( g S_1) \, \mathcal{S}( g sS_2)
      {\, \atop \,}
   \right)
  $$

This exhibits the [[S-matrix]]-scheme as a "[[causal ordering|causally ordered]] [[exponential]]"
or "[[Dyson series]]" of the [[interaction]], hence as a refinement to [[relativistic field theory]] of what in
[[quantum mechanics]] is the "integral version of the [[Schrödinger equation]] in the [[interaction picture]]" (eq:IntegralVersionSchroedingerEquationInInteractionPicture). (See also [Scharf 95, second half of 0.3](#Scharf95)).

While [[causal additivity]] is in fact stronger than [[causal factorization]], we find below that the
evident analogue of [[causal factorization]] imposed directly on the [[time-ordered products]] (def. \ref{TimeOrderedProduct} below)
does _imply_ [[causal additivity]] of the [[S-matrix]] (prop. \ref{TimeOrderedProductInducesPerturbativeSMatrix} below).

The relevance of [[causal additivity]] of the [[S-matrix]], over just [[causal factorization]], is that it implies that
the induced [[interacting field algebra of observables]] (def. \ref{InteractingFieldObservables}) forms a [[causally local net]] (prop. \ref{PerturbativeQuantumObservablesIsLocalnet} below).

###### Remark
**([[path integral]]-intuition)**

In informal discussion of [[perturbative QFT]] going back to informal ideas of [[Schwinger-Tomonaga-Feynman-Dyson]], the
perturbative [[S-matrix]] is thought of in terms of a would-be _[[path integral]]_, symbolically written

$$
  \mathcal{S}\left(
    g S_{int} + j A
  \right)
  \;\overset{\text{not really!}}{=}\;
  \!\!\!\!\!
  \underset{\Phi \in \Gamma_\Sigma(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})_{asm}}{\int}
  \!\!\!\!\!\!
  \exp\left(
    \tfrac{1}{i \hbar}
    \int_\Sigma
    \left(
      g L_{int}(\Phi) + j A(\Phi)
    \right)
  \right)
  \,
  \exp\left(
    \tfrac{1}{i \hbar}\int_\Sigma L_{free}(\Phi)
  \right) D[\Phi]
  \,.
$$

Here the would-be [[integration]] is thought to be over the [[space of field histories]] $\Gamma_\Sigma(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})_{asm}$ (the [[space of sections]] of the given [[field bundle]]) for [[field histories]] which satisfy given asymptotic conditions at $x^0 \to \pm \infty$; and as these boundary conditions vary the above is regarded as a would-be [[integral kernel]] that defines the required operator in the [[Wick algebra]] (e.g. [Weinberg 95, around (9.3.10) and (9.4.1)](#Weinberg95)). This is related to the intuitive picture of the [[Feynman perturbation series]] expressing a sum over all possible interactions of [[virtual particles]] (remark \ref{WorldlineFormalism}).

Beyond toy examples, it is not known how to define the would-be [[measure]] $D[\Phi]$ and it is not known how to make sense of this expression as an actual [[integral]].

The analogous path-integral intuition for [[Bogoliubov's formula]] for [[interacting field observables]] (def. \ref{InteractingFieldObservables}) symbolically reads

$$
  \begin{aligned}
  A_{int}
  & \overset{\text{not really!}}{=}
  \frac{d}{d j}
  \ln
  \left(
  \underset{\Phi \in \Gamma_\Sigma(E)_{asm}}{\int}
  \!\!\!\!
  \exp\left(
    \underset{\Sigma}{\int}
      g L_{int}(\Phi) + j A(\Phi)
  \right)
  \,
  \exp\left( \underset{\Sigma}{\int} L_{free}(\Phi) \right)
  D[\Phi]
  \right)
  \vert_{j = 0}
  \end{aligned}
$$

If here we were to regard the expression

$$
  \mu(\Phi)
  \;\overset{\text{not really!}}{\coloneqq}\;
  \frac{
    \exp\left( \underset{\Sigma}{\int} L_{free}(\Phi) \right)\, D[\Phi]
  }
  {
    \underset{\Phi \in \Gamma_\Sigma(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})_{asm}}{\int}
    \!\!\!\!
    \exp\left( \underset{\Sigma}{\int} L_{free}(\Phi) \right)\, D[\Phi]
  }
$$

as a would-be [[Gaussian measure]] on the [[space of field histories]], normalized to a would-be [[probability measure]], then this formula
would express interacting field observables as ordinary [[expectation values]]

$$
  A_{int}
   \overset{\text{not really!}}{=}
   \!\!\!
  \underset{\Phi \in \Gamma_\Sigma(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})_{asm}}{\int}
  \!\!\!\!\!\!
     A(\Phi)
  \,\mu(\Phi)
  \,.
$$

As before, beyond toy examples it is not known how to make sense of this as an actual [[integration]].

But we may think of the axioms for the [[S-matrix]] in [[causal perturbation theory]] (def. \ref{LagrangianFieldTheoryPerturbativeScattering}) as rigorously _defining_ the [[path integral]], not analytically as an actual [[integration]], but _[[synthetic mathematics|synthetically]]_ by axiomatizing the properties of the desired _outcome_ of the would-be integration:

The analogy with a well-defined [[integral]] and the usual properties of an [[exponential]] vividly _suggest_
that the would-be [[path integral]] should obey [[causal factorization]]. Instead of trying to make sense of
[[path integral|path integration]] so that this factorization property could then be appealed to as a _consequence_ of general properties
of [[integration]] and [[exponentials]], the axioms of [[causal perturbation theory]] directly prescribe the
desired factorization property, without insisting that it derives from an actual integration.

The great success of [[path integral]]-intuition in the development of [[quantum field theory]], despite the dearth of
actual constructions, indicates that it is not the would-be integration process as such that actually matters in field
theory, but only the resulting properties that this _suggests_ the S-matrix should have; which is what
[[causal perturbation theory]] axiomatizes. Indeed, the simple [[axioms]] of [[causal perturbation theory]]
rigorously _imply_ finite (i.e. [[renormalization|("re"-)normalized]]) [[perturbative quantum field theory]] (see remark \ref{CausalPerturbationTheoryAbsenceOfUVDivergences}).

###### Remark
**([[adiabatic limit]], [[infrared divergences]] and [[interacting vacuum]])**

Since a [[local observable]] $S_{int} \in LocObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})[ [\hbar, g, j] ]$  by definition
has compact spacetime support, the [[scattering amplitudes]] in remark \ref{FromAxiomaticSMatrixScatteringAmplitudes}
describe [[scattering]] processes for [[interactions]] that vanish (are "[[adiabatic switching|adiabatically switched off]]") outside a compact subset of [[spacetime]]. This constraint is crucial for [[causal perturbation theory]] to work.

There are several aspects to this:

* ([[adiabatic limit]]) On the one hand, real physical interactions $\mathbf{L}_{int}$ (say the [[electron-photon interaction]])
are not _really_ supposed to vanish outside a compact region of spacetime. In order to reflect this mathematically, one may consider a [[sequence]] of [[adiabatic switchings]] $g_{sw} \in C^\infty_{cp}(\Sigma)\langle g \rangle$ (each of [[compact support]]) whose [[limit of a sequence|limit]] is the [[constant function]] $g \in C^\infty(\Sigma)\langle g\rangle$ (the actual [[coupling constant]]), then consider the corresponding [[sequence]] of [[interaction]] [[action functionals]] $S_{int,sw} \coloneqq \tau_\Sigma( g_{sw} \mathbf{L}_{int} )$ and finally consider:

     of [[tempered distribution|tempered distributional]] [[expectation values]] of products of [[interacting field algebra|interacting]] [[field observables]] (def. \ref{InteractingFieldObservables}) -- if it exists. (Similarly for [[time-ordered products]].)  This is called the _[[weak adiabatic limit]]_.

  Beware that the left hand sides here are symbolic: Even if the limit exists in [[expectation values]], in general there is no actual observable whose expectation value is that limit.

  The strong and weak adiabatic limits have been shown to exist if all [[field (physics)|fields]] are [[mass|massive]] ([Epstein-Glaser 73](#EpsteinGlaser73)). The weak adiabatic limit has been shown to exists for [[quantum electrodynamics]] and for [[mass]]-less [[phi^4 theory]] ([Blanchard-Seneor 75](adiabatic+switching#BlanchardSeneor75)) and for larger classes of field theories in ([Duch 17, p. 113, 114](adiabatic+switching#Duch17)).

  If these limits do not exist, one says that the [[perturbative QFT]] has an _[[infrared divergence]]_.

* ([[algebraic adiabatic limit]]) On the other hand, it is equally unrealistic that an actual [[experiment]] _detects_ phenomena outside a given compact subset of spacetime. Realistic scattering [[experiments]] (such as the [[LHC]]) do not really prepare or measure [[plane waves]] filling all of [[spacetime]] as described by the [[scattering amplitudes]] (eq:ScatteringPlaneWaves). Any [[observable]] that is realistically measurable must have compact spacetime support. We see below in prop. \ref{IsomorphismFromChangeOfAdiabaticSwitching} that such [[interacting field observables]] with compact spacetime support may be computed without taking the [[adiabatic limit]]: It is sufficient to use any [[adiabatic switching]] which is constant on the support of the observable.

  This way one obtains for each [[causally closed subset]] $\mathcal{O}$ of spacetime an  algebra of observables $\mathcal{A}_{int}(\mathcal{O})$ whose support is in $\mathcal{O}$, and for each inclusion of subsets a corresponding inclusion of algebras of observables (prop. \ref{PerturbativeQuantumObservablesIsLocalnet} below). Of this system of observables one may form the [[category theory|category-theoretic]] [[inductive limit]] to obtain a single global algebra of observables.

  $$
    \mathcal{A}_{int}
      \;\coloneqq\;
    \underset{\underset{\mathcal{O}}{\longrightarrow}}{\lim}
      \mathcal{A}_{int}(\mathcal{O})
  $$

  This always exists. It is called the _[[algebraic adiabatic limit]]_ (going back to [Brunetti-Fredenhagen 00, section 8](perturbative+algebraic+quantum+field+theory#BrunettiFredenhagen00)).

  For [[quantum electrodynamics]] the [[algebraic adiabatic limit]] was worked out in ([Dütsch-Fredenhagen 98](quantum+electrodynamics#DuetschFredenhagen98), reviewed in [Dütsch 18, 5,3](QED+Duetsch18)).

* ([[interacting vacuum]]) While, via the above [[algebraic adiabatic limit]], [[causal perturbation theory]] yields the correct [[interacting field algebra of quantum observables]] independent of choices of [[adiabatic switching]], a theory of _[[quantum probability]]_ requires, on top of the [[algebra of observables]], also a _[[state on a star-algebra|state]]_

  $$
    \langle - \rangle_{int} \;\colon\; \mathcal{A}_{int} \longrightarrow \mathbb{C}[ [\hbar] ]
  $$

  Just as the [[interacting field algebra of observables]] $\mathcal{A}_{int}$ is a [[deformation]] of the free field algebra of observables ([[Wick algebra]]), there ought to be a corresponding deformation of the free [[Hadamard vacuum state]] $\langle- \rangle$ into an "[[interacting vacuum state]]" $\langle - \rangle_{int}$.

  Sometimes the [[weak adiabatic limit]] serves to define the [[interacting vacuum]] (see [Duch 17, p. 113-114](adiabatic+switching#Duch17)).

A stark example of these infrared issues is the phenomenon of _[[confinement]]_ of [[quarks]] to [[hadron]] [[bound states]] (notably to [[protons]] and [[neutrons]]) at large [[wavelengths]]. This is paramount in [[experiment|observation]] and reproduced in numerical [[lattice gauge theory]] simulation, but is invisible to [[perturbative QFT|perturbative]] [[quantum chromodynamics]] in its [[free field]] [[vacuum state]], due to [[infrared divergences]].
It is expected that this should be rectified by the proper [[interacting vacuum]] of [[QCD]] ([Rafelski 90, pages 12-16](confinement#Rafelski90)), which is possibly a "[[theta-vacuum]]" exhibiting [[superposition]] of [[instanton in QCD|QCD instantons]] ([Schäfer-Shuryak 98, section III.D](instanton+in+QCD#SchaeferShuryak98)). This remains open, closely related to the _[Millenium Problem](http://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems/yang%E2%80%93mills-and-mass-gap)_ of [[quantization of Yang-Mills theory]].

In contrast to the above subtleties about the [[infrared divergences]], any would-be [[UV-divergences]] in [[perturbative QFT]] are
dealt with by [[causal perturbation theory]]:


+-- {: .num_remark #TheTraditionalErrorThatLeadsToTheNotoriouDivergencies}
###### Remark
**(the traditional error leading to [[UV-divergences]])**

Naively it might seem that (say over [[Minkowski spacetime]], for simplicity)
examples of [[time-ordered products]] according to def. \ref{TimeOrderedProduct}
might simply be obtained by multiplying [[Wick algebra]]-products with [[step functions]] $\Theta$ of the time coordinates, hence to write, in the notation as [[generalized functions]] (remark \ref{NotationForTimeOrderedProductsAsGeneralizedFunctions}):

$$
  T(x_1, x_2)
  \overset{\text{no!}}{=}
  \Theta(x_1^0 - x_2^0) \, T(x_1) \, T(x_2)
  +
  \Theta(x_2^0 - x_1^0) \, T(x_2) \, T(x_1)
$$

and analogously for time-ordered products of more arguments (for instance [Weinberg 95, p. 143, between (3.5.9) and (3.5.10)](#Weinberg95)).

This however is simply a mathematical error (as amplified in [Scharf 95, below (3.2.4), below (3.2.44) and in fig. 3](causal+perturbation+theory#Scharf95)):

Both $T$ as well as $\Theta$ are [[distributions]] and their [[product of distributions]] is in general not defined ([[Hörmander's criterion]] may be violated). The notorious [[ultraviolet divergences]] which plagued ([Feynman 85](Schwinger-Tomonaga-Feynman-Dyson#Feynman85SuchABunchOfWords)) the original conception of [[perturbative QFT]] due to [[Schwinger-Tomonaga-Feynman-Dyson]] are the signature of this ill-defined product (see remark \ref{CausalPerturbationTheoryAbsenceOfUVDivergences}).

On the other hand, when both distributions are [[restriction of distributions|restricted]] to the [[complement]] of the [[diagonal]]
(i.e. restricted away from coinciding points $x_1 = x_2$), then the [[step function]] becomes a [[non-singular distribution]]
so that the above expression happens to be well defined and does solve the axioms for time-ordered products.

Hence what needs to be done to properly define the [[time-ordered product]] is to choose an [[extension of distributions]] of the above product expression back from the complement of the diagonal to the whole space of [[tuples]] of points. Any such extension will produce time-ordered products.

There are in general several different such [[extension of distributions|extensions]]. This freedom of choice is the freedom
of _[[renormalization|"re-"normalization]]_; or equivalently, by the [[main theorem of perturbative renormalization theory]] (theorem \ref{PerturbativeRenormalizationMainTheorem}),
this is the freedom of choosing "counter terms" for the [[local observable|local]] [[interactions]]. This we discuss below in
_[Feynman diagrams and (re-)normalization](#ExistenceAndRenormalization)_.

+-- {: .num_remark #CausalPerturbationTheoryAbsenceOfUVDivergences}
###### Remark
**(absence of [[ultraviolet divergences]] and [[renormalization|re-normalization]])**

The simple axioms of [[causal perturbation theory]] (def. \ref{LagrangianFieldTheoryPerturbativeScattering})
do fully capture [[perturbative quantum field theory]] "in the ultraviolet": A solution to these axioms
induces, by definition, well-defined [[perturbative QFT|perturbative]] [[scattering amplitudes]] (remark \ref{FromAxiomaticSMatrixScatteringAmplitudes})
and well-defined [[perturbative QFT|perturbative]] [[probability amplitudes]] of [[interacting field observables]] (def. \ref{InteractingFieldObservables}) induced by _[[local observables|local]]_ [[action functionals]] (describing point-interactions such as the [[electron-photon interaction]]). By the [[main theorem of perturbative renormalization]] (theorem \ref{PerturbativeRenormalizationMainTheorem}) such solutions exist. This means that, while these are necessarily [[formal power series]] in $\hbar$ and $g$ (remark \ref{AsymptoticSeriesObservables}), all the [[coefficients]] of these formal power series ("[[loop order]] contributions") are well defined.

This is in contrast to the original informal conception of [[perturbative QFT]] due to [[Schwinger-Tomonaga-Feynman-Dyson]],
which in a first stage produced ill-defined [[divergence|diverging]] expressions for the [[coefficients]] (due to the mathematical error discussed in remark \ref{TheTraditionalErrorThatLeadsToTheNotoriouDivergencies} below), which were then "[[renormalization|re-normalized]]" to finite values, by further informal arguments.

Here in [[causal perturbation theory]] no [[divergences]] in the [[coefficients]] of the [[formal power series]] are considered in the first place, all coefficients are well-defined, hence "finite". In this sense [[causal perturbation theory]] is about "finite" perturbative QFT, where instead of "re-normalization" of ill-defined expressions one just encounters "normalization" (prominently highlighted in [Scharf 95, see title, introduction, and section 4.3](causal+perturbation+theoryscatt#Scharf95)), namely compatible choices of these finite values, parameterized by the [[Stückelberg-Petermann renormalization group]].

This refers to those [[divergences]] that are known as _[[UV-divergences]]_, namely short-distance effects,
which are mathematically reflected in the fact that the perturbative [[S-matrix]] scheme (def. \ref{LagrangianFieldTheoryPerturbativeScattering})
is defined on _[[local observables]]_, which, by their very locality, encode point-[[interactions]].
See also remark \ref{AdiabaticLimit} on _[[infrared divergences]]_.

###### Remark
**([[virtual particles]], [[worldline formalism]] and [[perturbative string theory]])**

It is suggestive to think of the [[edges]] in the [[Feynman diagrams]] (def. \ref{FeynmanDiagram}) as [[worldlines]] of "[[virtual particles]]" and of the [[vertices]] as the points where they collide and transmute. (Care must be exercised not to confuse this with concepts of real [[particles]].) With this interpretation prop. \ref{FeynmanDiagramAmplitude} may be read as saying that the [[scattering amplitude]] for given external [[source fields]] (remark \ref{FromAxiomaticSMatrixScatteringAmplitudes}) is the [[superposition]] of the [[Feynman amplitudes]] of all possible ways that these may interact; which is closely related to the intuition for the [[path integral]] (remark \ref{InterpretationOfPerturbativeSMatrix}).

This intuition is made precise by the _[[worldline formalism]]_ of [[perturbative quantum field theory]] ([Strassler 92](worldline+formalism#Strassler92)). This is the perspective on [[perturbative QFT]] which directly relates [[perturbative QFT]] to [[perturbative string theory]] ([Schmidt-Schubert 94](worldline+formalism#SchmidtSchubert94)). In fact the [[worldline formalism]] for [[perturbative QFT]] was originally found by taking thre point-particle limit of [[string scattering amplitudes]] ([Bern-Kosower 91](worldline+formalism#BernKosower91), [Bern-Kosower 92](worldline+formalism#BernKosower92)).

for a fixed ([[adiabatic switching|adiabatically switched]] [[local observable|local]]) [[interaction]] $S_{int}$, reflecting the [[scattering amplitudes]] (remark \ref{FromAxiomaticSMatrixScatteringAmplitudes}) with respect to that particular interaction.  Hence the function

axiomatized in def. \ref{LagrangianFieldTheoryPerturbativeScattering} is really a whole _scheme_ for constructing compatible S-matrices for _all_ possible (adiabatically switched, local) interactions at once.

Since the usual proof of the construction of such schemes of S-matrices involves _[[renormalization|("re"-)normalization]]_, the function $\mathcal{S}$ axiomatized by def. \ref{LagrangianFieldTheoryPerturbativeScattering} may also be referred to as a _[[renormalization scheme|("re"-)normalization scheme]]_.

This perspective on $\mathcal{S}$ as a [[renormalization scheme]] is amplified by the [[main theorem of perturbative renormalization]] (theorem \ref{PerturbativeRenormalizationMainTheorem})
wich states that the space of choices for $\mathcal{S}$ is a [[torsor]] over the [[Stückelberg-Petermann renormalization group]].

**([[quantum anomalies]])**

The [[axioms]] for the [[S-matrix]] in def. \ref{LagrangianFieldTheoryPerturbativeScattering}
(and similarly that for the [[time-ordered products]] below in def. \ref{TimeOrderedProduct})
are sufficient to imply a [[causally local net]] of perturbative [[interacting field algebras of quantum observables]] (prop. \ref{PerturbativeQuantumObservablesIsLocalnet} below), and thus its [[algebraic adiabatic limit]] (remark \ref{AdiabaticLimit}).

It does not guarantee, however, that the [[BV-BRST differential]] passes to those
[[algebras of quantum observables]], hence it does not guarantee that the [[infinitesimal symmetries of the Lagrangian]]
are respected by the [[quantization]] process (there may be "[[quantum anomalies]]").
The extra condition that does ensure this is the _[[quantum master Ward identity]]_ or _[[quantum master equation]]_.
This we discuss elsewhere.

Apart from [[gauge symmetries]] one also wants to require that rigid symmetries  are preserved by the S-matrix, notably [[Poincare group]]-symmetry for scattering on [[Minkowski spacetime]]. This extra axiom is needed to imply the _[[main theorem of perturbative renormalization]]_ (theorem \ref{PerturbativeRenormalizationMainTheorem}).

#### Interacting field observables
 {#QuantumObservables}

We have seen that via [[Bogoliubov's formula]] (def. \ref{InteractingFieldObservables}) every perturbative [[S-matrix]] scheme (def. \ref{LagrangianFieldTheoryPerturbativeScattering}) induces for every choice of [[adiabatic switching|adiabatically switched]]
[[interaction]] [[action functional]] $S_{int,sw} \coloneqq \tau_\Sigma( g_{sw} \mathbf{L}_{int} )$ a notion of [[perturbative QFT|perturbative]] [[interacting field observables]] (def. \ref{InteractingFieldObservables}). These generate an algebra (def. \ref{QuntumMollerOperator} below).
By [[Bogoliubov's formula]], in general this algebra depends on the choice of [[adiabatic switching]];
which however is not meant to be part of the [[physics]], but just a mathematical device for grasping global field structures locally.

But this spurious dependence  goes away (prop. \ref{IsomorphismFromChangeOfAdiabaticSwitching} below) when restricting attention to
observables whose spacetime support is inside a compact [[causally closed subsets]] $\mathcal{O}$ of spacetime (def. \ref{PerturbativeGeneratingLocalNetOfObservables} below). This is a sensible condition for an [[observable]] in [[physics]],
where any realistic [[experiment]] nessecarily probes only a compact subset of spacetime, see also remark \ref{AdiabaticLimit}.

The resulting system (a "[[co-presheaf]]") of well-defined perturbative [[interacting field algebras of observables]] (def. \ref{SystemOfAlgebrasOfQuantumObservables} below)

$$
  \mathcal{O} \mapsto IntObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}}, \mathbf{L}_{int})(\mathcal{O})
$$

is in fact [[causal locality|causally local]] (prop. \ref{PerturbativeQuantumObservablesIsLocalnet} below).
This fact was presupposed without proof already in [Il'in-Slavnov 78](perturbative+algebraic+quantum+field+theory#IlinSlavnov78);
because this is one of two key properties that the [[Haag-Kastler axioms]] ([Haag-Kastler 64](Haag-Kastler+axioms#HaagKastler64)) demand of an intrinsically defined [[quantum field theory]]
(i.e. defined without necessarily making recourse to the geometric backdrop of [[Lagrangian field theory]]). The only other key property demanded by the [[Haag-Kastler axioms]]
is that the [[algebras of observables]] be [[C*-algebras]]; this however must be regarded as the axiom encoding
[[non-perturbative quantum field theory]] and hence is necessarily violated in the present context of [[perturbative QFT]].

Since quantum field theory following the full [[Haag-Kastler axioms]] is commonly known as _[[AQFT]]_, this perturbative version,
with [[causally local nets of observables]] but without the [[C*-algebra]]-condition on them, has come to be called
_[[perturbative AQFT]]_ ([Dütsch-Fredenhagen 01](perturbative+algebraic+quantum+field+theory#DuetschFredenhagen01),
[Fredenhagen-Rejzner 12](perturbative+algebraic+quantum+field+theory#FredenhagenRejzner12)).

In this terminology the content of prop. \ref{PerturbativeQuantumObservablesIsLocalnet} below is that
_while the input of [[causal perturbation theory]] is a [[gauge fixing|gauge fixed]] [[Lagrangian field theory]],
the output is a [[perturbative algebraic quantum field theory]]_:

      \\
      \text{Dütsch-Fredenhagen 01)}
    }
    }{\,}
  }
$$


The independence of the [[causally local net]] of localized [[interacting field algebras of observables]]
$IntObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}}, \mathbf{L}_{int} )(\mathcal{O})$ from the choice of [[adiabatic switching]]
implies a well-defined spacetime-global [[algebra of observables]] by forming the [[inductive limit]]

$$
  IntObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}}, \mathbf{L}_{int})
    \;\coloneqq\;
  \underset{\underset{\mathcal{O}}{\longrightarrow}}{\lim}

  \right)
  \,.
$$

This is also called the _[[algebraic adiabatic limit]]_, defining the [[algebras of observables]] of [[perturbative QFT]]
"in the infrared". The only remaining step in the construction of a [[perturbative QFT]] that remains is then
to find an [[interacting vacuum state]]

$$

The key technical fact is the following:

###### Proposition
**(localized [[interacting field observables]] independent of [[adiabatic switching]])**

Let $(E_{\text{BV-BRST}}, \mathbf{L}', \Delta_H )$ be a [[relativistic field theory|relativistic]] [[free field theory|free]] [[vacuum]] according to def. \ref{VacuumFree}, let $\mathcal{S}$ be a corresponding [[S-matrix]] scheme according to def. \ref{LagrangianFieldTheoryPerturbativeScattering}, and let

$$
  \mathbf{L}_{int}
  \;\in\;
  \Omega^{p+1,0}_\Sigma(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})[ [ \hbar , g  ] ]
$$

be a [[Lagrangian density]], to be thought of as an [[interaction]], so that for $g_{sw} \in C^\infty_{sp}(\Sigma)\langle g \rangle$
an [[adiabatic switching]] the [[transgression of variational differential forms|transgression]]

$$
  g S_{int,sw} \;\coloneqq\; \tau_\Sigma(g_{sw} \mathbf{L}_{int})
  \;\in\;
  LocObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})[ [ \hbar, g, j] ]
$$

is a [[local observable]], to be thought of as an [[adiabatic switching|adiabatically switched]] [[interaction]] [[action functional]].

If two such [[adiabatic switchings]] $g_{sw,1}, g_{sw,2} \in C^\infty_{cp}(\Sigma)$ agree on a
[[causally closed subset]]

$$
  \mathcal{O} \;\subset\; \Sigma
$$

in that

$$
  g_{sw,1}\vert_{\mathcal{O}} = g_{sw,2}\vert_{\mathcal{O}}
$$

then there exists a [[microcausal polynomial observable]]

$$
  K \;\in\; PolyObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})_{mc}[ [ \hbar, g, j ] ]
$$

such that for every [[local observable]]

$$
  A \;\in\; LocObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})[ [ \hbar, g ] ]
$$

with spacetime support in $\mathcal{O}$

$$
  supp(A) \;\subset\; \mathcal{O}
$$

the corresponding two [[generating functions]] (eq:GeneratingFunctionInducedFromSMatrix)
are related via [[conjugation]] by $K$:

$$
  \label{AdiabaticSwitchingRelationGeneratingFunctions}
  \mathcal{Z}_{S_{int,sw_2}}
  \left(
    j A
  \right)
  \;=\;
  K^{-1}
  \,
  \left(
    \mathcal{Z}_{S_{int,sw_1}}
    \left(
      j A
    \right)
  \right)
  \,
  K
  \,.
$$

In particular this means that for every choice of [[adiabatic switching]] $g_{sw} \in Cutoffs(\mathcal{O})$
the algebra $Gen_{S_{int,sw}}(\mathcal{O})$ of [[generating functions]] for [[interacting field observables]]
computed with $g_{sw}$ is canonically [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the
abstract algebra $Gen_{\mathbf{L}_{int}}(\mathcal{O})$  (def. \ref{PerturbativeGeneratingLocalNetOfObservables}),
by the evident map on generators:

$$
  \label{AbstractGeneratingFunctionAlgebraIsomorphicToAnyAdiabaticSwitching}
  \array{
    Gen(E_{\text{BV-BRST}}, \mathbf{L}_{int})(\mathcal{o})
      &\overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}&
    Gen(E_{\text{BV-BRST}}, S_{int,sw})(\mathcal{O})
    \\
    \left(
      \mathcal{Z}_{S_{int,sw'}}
    \right)_{g_{sw'} \in Cutoffs(\mathcal{O})}
    &\mapsto&
    \mathcal{Z}_{S_{int,sw}}
  }
  \,.
$$

=--

([Brunetti-Fredenhagen 99, prop. 8.1](#BrunettiFredenhagen99))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By causal closure of $\mathcal{O}$, [this lemma](A+first+idea+of+quantum+field+theory#CausalPartition)
says that there are [[bump functions]]

$$
  a, r \in C^\infty_{cp}(\Sigma)\langle g \rangle
$$

which decompose the difference of [[adiabatic switchings]]

$$
  g_{sw,2} - g_{sw,1} = a + r
$$

subject to the [[causal ordering]]

$$
  supp(a) \,{\vee\!\!\!\wedge}\, \mathcal{O} \,{\vee\!\!\!\wedge}\, supp(r)
  \,.
$$

With this the result follows from repeated use of [[causal additivity]] in its various equivalent
incarnations from prop. \ref{ZCausalAdditivity}:

This proves the existence of elements $K$ as claimed.

It is clear that conjugation induces an algebra homomorphism,
and since the map is a linear isomorphism on the space of generators,
it is an algebra isomorphism on the algebras being generated (eq:AbstractGeneratingFunctionAlgebraIsomorphicToAnyAdiabaticSwitching).

(While the elements $K$ in (eq:AdiabaticSwitchingRelationGeneratingFunctions) are far from being unique themselves,
equation (eq:AdiabaticSwitchingRelationGeneratingFunctions) says that the map on generators induced
by conjugation with $K$ is independent of this choice.)

###### Remark
**([[time-ordered products]] as [[generalized functions]])**

It is convenient (as in [Epstein-Glaser 73](#EpsteinGlaser73)) to think of [[time-ordered products]] (def. \ref{TimeOrderedProduct}), being
[[Wick algebra]]-valued [[distributions]] (hence [[operator-valued distributions]] if we were to choose a [[representation]] of the
[[Wick algebra]] by [[linear operators]] on a [[Hilbert space]]), as [[generalized functions]] depending on spacetime points:

If

$$
  \left\{
    \alpha_ \in \Omega^{p+1,0}_\Sigma(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})\langle g \rangle
  \right\}
  \cup
  \left\{
    \beta_j \in \Omega^{p+1,0}_\Sigma(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})\langle j \rangle
  \right\}
$$

is a [[finite set]] of [[horizontal differential forms]], and

$$
  \left\{
    g_i, j_{j} \in C^\infty_{cp}(\Sigma)
  \right\}
$$

is a corresponding set of [[bump functions]] on [[spacetime]] ([[adiabatic switchings]]), so that

$$
  \left\{
    S_j
      \colon
    \Phi
      \mapsto
    \underset{\Sigma}{\int} g_i(x) \, \left(j^\infty_\Sigma(\Phi)^\ast \alpha_i\right)(x)\, dvol_\Sigma(x)
  \right\}
  \;\cup\;
  \left\{
    A_j
      \colon
    \Phi
      \mapsto
    \underset{\Sigma}{\int} j_i(x) \, \left(j^\infty_\Sigma(\Phi)^\ast \beta_i\right)(x)\, dvol_\Sigma(x)
  \right\}
$$

is the corresponding set of [[local observables]], then we may write the [[time-ordered product]]
of these observables as the [[integration]] of these [[bump functions]] against a [[generalized function]]
$T_{(\alpha_i)}$ with values in the [[Wick algebra]]:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    &
    \underset{\Sigma^n}{\int}
      T_{(\alpha_i), (\beta_j)}(x_1, \cdots, x_{r}, x_{r+1}, \cdots x_{n})
      g_1(x_1) \cdots g_r(x_r)
      \,
      j_1(x_{r+1}) \cdots j_n(x_n)
    \, dvol_{\Sigma^n}(x_1, \cdots x_n)
    \\
    & \coloneqq
      T( S_1, \cdots, S_r, A_{r+1}, \cdots, A_n )
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

Moreover, the subscripts on these [[generalized functions]] will always be
clear from the context, so that in computations we may notationally suppress these.

Finally, due to the "symmetry" axiom in def. \ref{TimeOrderedProduct}, a time-ordered product
depends, up to signs, only on its [[set]] of arguments, not on the order of the arguments. We will write
$\mathbf{X} \coloneqq \{x_1, \cdots, x_r\}$ and $\mathbf{Y} \coloneqq \{y_1, \cdots y_r\}$
for sets of spacetime points, and hence abbreviate the expression for the "value" of the
generalized function in the above as $T(\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{Y})$ etc.

In this condensed notation the above reads

$$
    \underset{\Sigma^{r+s}}{\int}
      T(\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{Y})
      \,
      g_1(x_1) \cdots g_r(x_r)
      j_{r+1}(x_{r+1}) \cdots j_n(x_n)
    \,
    dvol_{\Sigma^{r+s}}(\mathbf{X})
  \,.
$$

=--

This condensed notation turns out to be greatly simplify computations, as it absorbs all the "relative"
combinatorial prefactors:

  \underoverset{n = 0}{\infty}{\sum}
   \frac{1}{n!}
   \int U(x_1, \cdots, x_n)
   \,

$$

and

$$

Then their product $W(g) \coloneqq U(g) V(g)$ with [[generalized function]]-representation

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

For fixed [[cardinality]] ${\vert \mathbf{I} \vert} = n_1$
the sum over all subsets $\mathbf{I} \subset \mathbf{X}$ overcounts the sum over
[[partitions]] of the coordinates as $(x_1, \cdots x_{n_1}, x_{n_1 + 1}, \cdots x_n)$ precisely by the
[[binomial coefficient]] $\frac{n!}{n_1! (n - n_1) !}$. Here the factor of $n!$ cancels
against the "global" combinatorial prefactor in the above expansion of $W(g)$, while the remaining
factor $\frac{1}{n_1! (n - n_1) !}$ is just the "relative" combinatorial prefactor seen at total order $n$
when expanding the product $U(g)V(g)$.

In order to prove that the axioms for [[time-ordered products]] do imply those for a perturbative [[S-matrix]]
(prop. \ref{TimeOrderedProductInducesPerturbativeSMatrix} below) we need to consider
the corresponding reverse-time ordered products:

$$
  \overline{T}( A_1 \cdots A_n )

Given [[time-ordered products]] $T(-)$ (def. \ref{TimeOrderedProduct}), then the

expresses the [[inverse]] $S(-)^{-1}$ (according to remark \ref{PerturbativeSMatrixInverse}) of the corresponding
perturbative [[S-matrix]] scheme $\mathcal{S}(S_{int}) \coloneqq \underset{k \in \mathbb{N}}{\sum} \tfrac{1}{k!} T(\underset{k\,\text{args}}{\underbrace{S_{int}, \cdots , S_{int}}})$ (def. \ref{LagrangianFieldTheoryPerturbativeScattering}):

    \right)^k
    \overline{T}( \underset{k \, \text{arguments}}{\underbrace{ (g S_{int} + j A), \cdots, (g S_{int} + j A)}} )
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

For brevity we write just "$A$" for $\tfrac{1}{i \hbar}(g S_{int} + j A)$.
(Hence we assume without restriction that $A$ is not independent of
powers of $g$ and $j$; this is just for making all sums in the following be order-wise finite sums.)

By definition we have

$$
  \begin{aligned}
  &
  \underset{k \in \mathbb{N}}{\sum}
    \frac{1}{k!}
    \overline{T}( \underset{k \, \text{args}}{\underbrace{A,  \cdots , A}} )
  \\
  & =
  \underset{ k \in \mathbb{N}}{\sum}
    \frac{1}{k!}
    \underoverset{r = 1}{k}{\sum}
    (-1)^r
    \!\!\!\underset{\sigma \in Unshuffl(k,r)}{\sum}\!\!\!
    T( A_{\sigma(1)} \cdots A_{\sigma(k_1)} )
    T( A_{\sigma(k_1 + 1)} \cdots A_{\sigma(k_2)} )
    \cdots
    T( A_{\sigma(k_{r-1}+1)} \cdots A_{\sigma_{k_r}} )
  \end{aligned}
$$

where all the $A_k$ happen to coincide: $A_k = A$.

If instead of [[unshuffles]] (i.e. [[partitions]] into non-empty subsequences preserving the original order) we took
partitions into arbitrarily ordered subsequences,
we would be overcounting by the [[factorial]] of the length of the subsequences, and hence the
above may be equivalently written as:

$$
  \cdots
  =
  \underset{k \in \mathbb{N}}{\sum}
    \tfrac{1}{k!}
    \underoverset{r = 1}{k}{\sum}
    (-1)^r
    \!\!\!
    \underset{ {\sigma \in \Sigma(k)} \atop { { k_1 + \cdots + k_r = k } \atop { \underset{i}{\forall} (k_i \geq 1) } } }{\sum}
    \!\!\!
    \tfrac{1}{k_1!} \cdots \tfrac{1}{k_r !}
    \,
    T( A_{\sigma(1)} \cdots A_{\sigma(k_1)} )
    \,
    T( A_{\sigma(k_1 + 1)} \cdots A_{\sigma(k_2)} )
    \cdots
    T( A_{\sigma(k_{r-1}+1)} \cdots A_{\sigma_{k_r}} )
    \,,
$$

where $\Sigma(k)$ denotes the [[symmetric group]] (the set of all [[permutations]] of $k$ elements).

Moreover, since all the $A_k$ are equal, the sum is in fact independent of $\sigma$, it only depends
on the length of the subsequences. Since there are $k!$ permutations of $k$ elements
the above reduces to

$$

In the condensed notation of remark \ref{NotationForTimeOrderedProductsAsGeneralizedFunctions},
we need to show that for $\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{P} \cup \mathbf{Q}$ with $\mathbf{P} \cap \mathbf{Q} = \emptyset$
then

$$
  \left(
    \mathbf{P} {\vee\!\!\!\wedge} \mathbf{Q}

    \overline{T}(\mathbf{X})
     =
    \overline{T}(\mathbf{Q}) \overline{T}(\mathbf{P})

$$

We proceed by [[induction]]. If ${\vert \mathbf{X}\vert} = 1$ the statement is immediate.
So assume that the statement is true for sets of [[cardinality]] $n \geq 1$ and consider
$\mathbf{X}$ with ${\vert \mathbf{X}\vert} = n+1$.

We make free use of the condensed notation as in example \ref{ProductOfPerturbationSeriesInGenealizedFunctionNotation}.

From the formal inversion

$$
  \underset{\mathbf{J} \subset \mathbf{X}}{\sum} \overline{T}(\mathbf{J}) T(\mathbf{X}\setminus \mathbf{J})
  = 0
$$

(which uses the induction assumption that ${\vert \mathbf{X}\vert} \geq 1$) it follows that

Here

1. in the second line we used that $\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{Q} \sqcup \mathbf{P}$, together with the
[[causal factorization]] property of $T(-)$ (which holds by def. \ref{TimeOrderedProduct}) and that of $\overline{T}(-)$
(which holds by the induction assumption, using that $\mathbf{J} \neq \mathbf{X}$ hence that
${\vert \mathbf{J}\vert} \lt {\vert \mathbf{X}\vert}$).

1. in the third line we decomposed the sum over $\mathbf{J}, \mathbf{J}' \subset \mathbf{X}$
into two sums over subsets of $\mathbf{Q}$ and $\mathbf{P}$:

   1. The first summand in the third line is the contribution where $\mathbf{J}'$ has a non-empty intersection with $\mathbf{Q}$. This makes $\mathbf{K}$ range without constraint, and therefore the sum in the middle vanishes, as indicated, as it is the contribution at order ${\vert \mathbf{Q}\vert}$ of the inversion formula from prop. \ref{InversionFormulaForTimeOrderedProducts}.

   1. The second summand in the third line is the contribution where $\mathbf{J}'$ does not intersect $\mathbf{Q}$.
     Now the sum over $\mathbf{K}$ is the inversion formula from prop. \ref{InversionFormulaForTimeOrderedProducts} except for one term, and so it equals that term.

Using these facts about the reverse-time ordered products,
we may finally prove that [[time-ordered products]] indeed do induced a perturbative S-matrix:

+-- {: .num_prop #TimeOrderedProductInducesPerturbativeSMatrix}
###### Proposition
**([[time-ordered products]] induce [[S-matrix]])**

Let $\{T_k\}_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a system of [[time-ordered products]] according to def. \ref{TimeOrderedProduct}.
Then

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \mathcal{S}(-)
    & \coloneqq
    T
    \left(
      \exp_\otimes
      \left(

    \underset{k \in \mathbb{N}}{\sum}
    \tfrac{1}{k!}
    \tfrac{1}{(i \hbar)^k}  T( \underset{k \, \text{factors}}{\underbrace{-,  \cdots , -}} )
  \end{aligned}
$$

is indeed a perturbative S-matrix according to def. \ref{LagrangianFieldTheoryPerturbativeScattering}.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The axiom "perturbation" of the S-matrix is
immediate from the axioms "perturbation" and "normalization" of the time-ordered products.
What requires proof is that [[causal additivity]] of the S-matrix follows from
the [[causal factorization]] property of the time-ordered products.

Notice that also the weaker [[causal factorization]] property of the S-matrix (remark \ref{DysonCausalFactorization})
is immediate from the causal factorization condition on the time-ordered products.

But [[causal additivity]] is stronger. It is remarkable that this, too,
follows from just the time-ordering ([Epstein-Glaser 73, around (73)](#EpsteinGlaser73)):

To see this, first expand the
generating function $\mathcal{Z}$ (eq:GeneratingFunctionInducedFromSMatrix)  into
powers of $g$ and $j$

$$
  \mathcal{Z}_{g S_{int}}(j A)
  \;=\;
  \underoverset{n,m = 0}{\infty}{\sum}
   \frac{1}{n! m!}
   R\left(
      {\, \atop \,}
      \underset{n\, \text{factors}}{\underbrace{g S_{int},  \cdots ,g S_{int}}},
      ( \underset{m \, \text{factors}}{ \underbrace{ j A ,  \cdots , j A } }  )
      {\, \atop \,}
   \right)
$$

and then compare order-by-order with the given time-ordered product $T$ and
its induced reverse-time ordered product (def. \ref{ReverseTimeOrderedProduct}) via prop. \ref{ReverseTimOrderedProductsGiveReverseSMatrix}.
(These $R(-,-)$ are also called the "generating [[retarded products]], discussed in their own right around def. \ref{RetardedProductFromPerturbativeSMatrix} below.)

In the condensed notation of
remark \ref{NotationForTimeOrderedProductsAsGeneralizedFunctions}
and its way of absorbing combinatorial prefactors as in example \ref{ProductOfPerturbationSeriesInGenealizedFunctionNotation}
this
yields at order $(g/\hbar)^{\vert \mathbf{Y}\vert} (j/\hbar)^{\vert \mathbf{X}\vert}$ the coefficient

$$
  \label{CoefficientOfgeneratingRetardedProduct}
  R(\mathbf{Y}, \mathbf{X})
   \;=\;
  \underset{\mathbf{I} \subset \mathbf{Y}}{\sum}
    \overline{T}(\mathbf{I})
    T( (\mathbf{Y} \setminus \mathbf{I}) , \mathbf{X} )
  \,.
$$

We claim now that the [[support of a distribution|support]] of $R$ is inside the subset for which
$\mathbf{Y}$ is in the [[causal past]] of $\mathbf{X}$. This will imply the claim, because by
multi-linearity of $R(-,-)$ it then follows that

$$
  \left(supp(A_1) {\vee\!\!\!\wedge} supp(A_2)\right)
  \Rightarrow
  \left( Z_{(g S_{int}  + j A_1)}(j A_2) = Z_{S_{int}}(A_2) \right)
$$

and by prop. \ref{ZCausalAdditivity} this is equivalent to [[causal additivity]] of the S-matrix.

It remains to prove the claim:

Consider $\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{Y} \subset \Sigma$ such that the subset $\mathbf{P} \subset \mathbf{Y}$
of points not in the past of $\mathbf{X}$, hence the maximal subset with [[causal ordering]]

$$
  \mathbf{P} {\vee\!\!\!\wedge} \mathbf{X}
  \,,
$$

is non-empty. We need to show that in this case $R(\mathbf{Y}, \mathbf{X}) = 0$ (in the sense of generalized functions).

Write $\mathbf{Q} \coloneqq \mathbf{Y} \setminus \mathbf{P}$
for the complementary set of points, so that all points of $\mathbf{Q}$ are in the past of $\mathbf{X}$.
Notice that this implies that $\mathbf{P}$ is also not in the past of $\mathbf{Q}$:

$$
  \mathbf{P} {\vee\!\!\!\wedge} \mathbf{Q}
  \,.
$$

With this decomposition of $\mathbf{Y}$, the sum in (eq:CoefficientOfgeneratingRetardedProduct)
over subsets $\mathbf{I}$ of $\mathbf{Y}$ may be decomposed into a sum over
subsets $\mathbf{J}$ of $\mathbf{P}$ and $\mathbf{K}$ of $\mathbf{Q}$, respectively.
These subsets inherit the above causal ordering, so that by the causal factorization property of
$T(-)$ (def. \ref{TimeOrderedProduct}) and $\overline{T}(-)$ (prop. \ref{ReverseCausalFactorizationOfReverseTimeOrderedProducts})
the time-ordered and reverse time-ordered products
factor on these arguments:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    R(\mathbf{Y}, \mathbf{X})
    & =
    \underset{ {\mathbf{J} \subset \mathbf{P}} \atop { \mathbf{K} \subset \mathbf{Q} } }{\sum}
     \,
     \overline{T}( \mathbf{J} \cup \mathbf{K} )
     T( (\mathbf{P} \setminus \mathbf{J}) \cup (\mathbf{Q} \setminus \mathbf{K}), \mathbf{X} )
     \\
     & =
     \underset{ {\mathbf{J} \subset \mathbf{P}} \atop { \mathbf{K} \subset \mathbf{Q} } }{\sum}
     \,
     \overline{T}( \mathbf{K} )
     \overline{T}( \mathbf{J} )
     T( \mathbf{P} \setminus \mathbf{J} )
     T( \mathbf{Q} \setminus \mathbf{K}, \mathbf{X} )
     \\
     & =
     \underset{ \mathbf{K} \subset \mathbf{Q} }{\sum}
     \overline{T}(\mathbf{K})
     \underset{= 0}{
     \underbrace{
     \left(
       \underset{\mathbf{J} \subset \mathbf{P}}{\sum}
       \overline{T}(\mathbf{J})
       T( \mathbf{P} \setminus \mathbf{J} )
     \right)
     }}
     T(\mathbf{Q} \setminus \mathbf{K}, \mathbf{X})
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

Here the sub-sum in brackets vanishes by the inversion formula, prop. \ref{InversionFormulaForTimeOrderedProducts}.

#### ("Re"-)Normalization
 {#ExistenceAndRenormalization}

We discuss now that [[time-ordered products]] as in def. \ref{TimeOrderedProduct}, hence, by prop. \ref{TimeOrderedProductInducesPerturbativeSMatrix}, perturbatibe [[S-matrix]] schemes (def. \ref{LagrangianFieldTheoryPerturbativeScattering}) exist in fact uniquely away from coinciding interaction points (prop. \ref{TimeOrderedProductAwayFromDiagonal} below). This means that the construction of full [[time-ordered products]]/[[S-matrix]] schemes may be phrased as an [[extension of distributions]] of unique time ordered products away from coinciding interaction points to these coinciding interaction points. This [[extension of distributions]] is called [[renormalization|("re"-)normalization]] (def. \ref{ExtensionOfTimeOrderedProoductsRenormalization} below).

**([[time-ordered product]] away from coinciding interaction points)**

Let $(E_{\text{BV-BRST}}, \mathbf{L}', \Delta_H )$ be a [[relativistic field theory|relativistic]] [[free field theory|free]] [[vacuum]] according to def. \ref{VacuumFree}, and let $T = \{T_k\}_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence of [[time-ordered products]] (def. \ref{TimeOrderedProduct})

$$

$$

Then their [[restriction]] to the subspace of [[tuples]] of [[local observables]] of pairwise disjoint spacetime support (def. \ref{TuplesOfCompactlySupportedPolynomialLocalFunctionalsWithPairwiseDisjointSupport}) is unique (independent of the [[renormalization|"re-"normalization]] freedom in choosing $T$) and is given by the [[star product]]

that is induced ([this def.](star+product#PropagatorStarProduct)) by the [[Feynman propagator]] $\Delta_F \coloneqq \tfrac{i}{2}(\Delta_+ + \Delta_- + H)$ (corresponding to the [[Wightman propagator]] $\Delta_H = \tfrac{i}{2}(\Delta_+ - \Delta_-) + H$ which is given by the choice of [[free field|free]] [[vacuum]]), in that

In particular the time-ordered product extends from the restricted domain of tensor products of local observables to a restricted domain of [[microcausal polynomial observables]], where it becomes an [[associativity|associative]] product:

  \end{aligned}
$$

for all tuples of local observables $A_1, \cdots, A_{k_1}, A_{k_1+1}, \cdots, A_{k_2}, \cdots, \cdots A_{k_n}$ with pairwise disjoint spacetime support.

=--

The idea of this statement goes back at least to [Epstein-Glaser 73](#EpsteinGlaser73), as in remark \ref{TheTraditionalErrorThatLeadsToTheNotoriouDivergencies}. One formulation appears as ([Brunetti-Fredenhagen 00, theorem 4.3](perturbative+algebraic+quantum+field+theory#BrunettiFredenhagen00)). The above formulation in terms of the [[star product]] is stated in ([Fredenhagen-Rejzner 12, p. 27](perturbative+algebraic+quantum+field+theory#FredenhagenRejzner12), [Dütsch 18, lemma 3.63 (b)](perturbative+algebraic+quantum+field+theory#Duetsch18)).

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By [[induction]] over the number of arguments, it is sufficient to see that, more generally, for $A_1, A_2 \in PolyObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})_{mc}[ [ \hbar, g, j] ]$ two [[microcausal polynomial observables]] with disjoint spacetime support the star product $A_1 \star_F A_2$ is well-defined and satisfies causal factorization.

Consider two [[partitions of unity]]

$$
  (\chi_{1,i} \in C^\infty_{cp}(\Sigma))_{i}
  \phantom{AAA}
  (\chi_{1,j} \in C^\infty_{cp}(\Sigma))_{j}
$$

and write $(A_{1,i})_i$ and $(A_{2,j})_{j}$ for the collection of [[microcausal polynomial observables]] obtained by multiplying all the [[distribution|distributional]] [[coefficients]] of $A_1$ and of $A_2$ with $\chi_{1,i}$ and with $\chi_{2,j}$, respectively, for all $i$ and $j$, hence such that

$$
  A_1 \;=\; \underset{i}{\sum} A_{1,i}
  \phantom{AAA}
  A_2 \;=\; \underset{j}{\sum} A_{1,j}
  \,.
$$

By linearity, it is sufficient to prove that $A_{1,i} \star_F A_{2,j}$ is well defined for all $i,j$ and satisfies causal factorization.

Since the spacetime supports of $A_1$ and $A_2$ are assumed to be disjoint

$$
  supp(A_1) \cap supp(A_2) \;=\; \emptyset
$$

we may find partitions such that each resulting pair of smaller supports is in fact in [[causal order]]-relation:

$$
  \array{
    \left(
      supp(A_1) \cap supp(\chi_{1,i})
    \right)
       {\vee\!\!\!\wedge}
    \left(
      supp(A_2) \cap supp(\chi_{2,j})
    \right)
    \\
    \text{or}
    \\
    \left(
      supp(A_2) \cap supp(\chi_{2,j})
    \right)
       {\vee\!\!\!\wedge}
    \left(
      supp(A_1) \cap supp(\chi_{1,u})
    \right)
  }
  \phantom{AAAAA}
  \text{for all}\,\, i,j
  \,.
$$

But now it follows as in the proof of [this prop.](Wick+algebra#CausalOrderingTimeOrderedProductOnRegular) (via [this equation](Wick+algebra#eq:CausallyOrderedWickProductViaFeynmanPropagator)) that

$$
  A_{1,i}
   \star_F
  A_{2,j}
  \;=\;
  \left\{
    \array{
      A_{1,i} \star_H A_{2,j} &\vert& supp(A_{1,i}) {\vee\!\!\!\wedge} supp(A_{2,j})
      \\
      A_{2,j} \star_H A_{1,i} &\vert& supp(A_{2,j}) {\vee\!\!\!\wedge} supp(A_{1,i})
  }
  \right.
$$


Finally the [[associativity]]-statement follows as in [this prop.](star+product#AssociativeAndUnitalStarProduct).

Via the [[associativity]] (eq:RestrictedTimeOrderedProductAssociative) of the restricted [[time-ordered product]] thesese choices are naturally made by [[induction]] over $k$, choosing the $(k+1)$-ary [[time-ordered product]] $T_{k+1}$ as an [[extension of distributions]] of $T_k(\underset{k \, \text{args}}{\underbrace{-, \cdots, -}}) \star_F (-)$.

This [[induction|inductive]] choice of [[extension of distributions]] of the [[time-ordered product]] to coinciding interaction points deserves to be called a choice of _normalization_ of the [[time-ordered product]] (e.g. [Scharf 94, section 4.3](#Scharf95)), but for historical reasons (see remark \ref{TheTraditionalErrorThatLeadsToTheNotoriouDivergencies} and remark \ref{CausalPerturbationTheoryAbsenceOfUVDivergences}) it is known as _[[renormalization|re-normalization]]_.

#### Feynman perturbation series
 {#FeynmanDiagrams}


By def \ref{ExtensionOfTimeOrderedProoductsRenormalization} and the [[main theorem of perturbative renormalization]] (theorem \ref{PerturbativeRenormalizationMainTheorem}), the construction of perturbative [[S-matrix]] schemes/[[time-ordered products]] may be phrased as [[renormalization|("re-")normalization]] of the [[star product]] induced by the [[Feynman propagator]], namely as a choice of [[extension of distributions]] of the this star-product to the locus of coinciding interaction points.

Since the [[star product]] is the [[exponential]] of the binary contraction with the [[Feynman propagator]], it is naturally expanded as a [[sum]] of [[products of distributions]] labeled by [[finite multigraphs]] (def. \ref{Graphs} below),
where each [[vertex]] corresponds to an [[interaction]] or [[source field]] insertion, and where each [[edge]]
corresponds to one contractions of two of these with the [[Feynman propagator]]. The [[products of distributions]]
arising this way are the _[[Feynman amplitudes]]_ (prop. \ref{FeynmanPerturbationSeriesAwayFromCoincidingPoints} below).

If the [[free field]] [[vacuum]] is decomposed as a [[direct sum]] of distinct [[free field]] [[types]]/species, then
in addition to the [[vertices]] also the edges in these [[graphs]] receive labels, now by the field species whose particular [[Feynman propagator]] is being used in the contraction at that edges.
These labeled graphs are now called _[[Feynman diagrams]]_ (def. \ref{FeynmanDiagram} below) and the [[products of distributions]] which they encode are their _[[Feynman amplitudes]]_ built by the _[[Feynman rules]]_ (prop. \ref{FeynmanDiagramAmplitude} below).

The choice of [[renormalization|("re"-)normalization]] of the [[time-ordered products]]/[[S-matrix]] is thus equivalently a choice of [[renormalization|("re"-)normalization]] of the [[Feynman amplitudes]] for all possible [[Feynman diagrams]].
These are usefully organized in powers of $\hbar$ by their _[[loop order]]_ (prop. \ref{FeynmanDiagramLoopOrder} below).

In conclusion, the [[Feynman rules]] make the perturbative [[S-matrix]] be equal to a [[formal power series]]
of [[Feynman amplitudes]] labeled by [[Feynman graphs]]. As such it is known as the _[[Feynman perturbation series]]_ (example \ref{FeynmanPerturbationSeries} below).

Notice how it is therefore the [[combinatorics]] of [[star products]] that governs both [[Wick's lemma]] in [[free field theory]] as well as [[Feynman diagram|Feynman diagrammatics]] in [[interacting field theory]]:

###### Definition
**([[finite graph|finite]] [[multigraphs]])**

A _[[finite graph|finite]] [[multigraph]]_ is

1. a [[finite set]] $V$ ("of [[vertices]]");

1. a [[finite set]] $E$ ("of [[edges]]");

1. a [[function]] $E \overset{p}{\to} \left\{ {\,\atop \,} \{v_1, v_2\} = \{v_2, v_1\} \;\vert\; v_1, v_2 \in V \,,\; v_1 \neq v_2 {\, \atop \,} \right\}$

   (sending any [[edge]] to the unordered pair of distinct [[vertices]] that it goes between).

Hence the [[isomorphism class]] of a [[finite multigraph]] is specified by

1. a [[natural number]]

   $$
     v \coloneqq {\vert V\vert} \in \mathbb{N}
   $$

   (the number of [[vertices]]);

1. for each $i \lt j \in \{1, \cdots, v\}$ a natural number

   $$
     e_{i,j} \coloneqq {\vert p^{-1}(\{v_i,v_j\})\vert} \in \mathbb{N}
   $$

   (the number of [[edges]] between the $i$th and the $j$th vertex).

We write $\mathcal{G}_v$ for the set of such [[isomorphism classes]] of finite multigraphs with ${\vert V \vert} = v$ vertices;
and we write

$$
  \mathcal{G} \;\coloneqq\; \underset{v \in \mathbb{N}}{\sqcup} \mathcal{G}_v
$$

for the set of [[isomorphism classes]] of finite multigraphs with any number of vertices.

The combinatorial factor over the brace is the [[multinomial coefficient]] expressing the number of ways of distributing $e_{v+1}$-many functional derivatives to $v$ factors, via the [[product rule]], and quotiented by the [[factorial]] that comes from the [[exponential]] in the definition of the [[star product]].

Here in the first step we used the [[associativity]] (eq:RestrictedTimeOrderedProductAssociative) of the restricted time-ordered product, in the second step we used the induction assumption,
in the third we passed the outer functional derivatives through the pointwise product using the [[product rule]], and in the fourth step we recognized that this amounts to summing
in addition over all possible choices of sets of edges from the first $v$ vertices to the new $v+1$st vertex,
which yield in total the sum over all diagrams with $v+1$ vertices.

###### Remark
**(no [[tadpole]] [[Feynman diagrams]])**

In the definition of [[finite multigraphs]] in def. \ref{Graphs} there are _no_ edges considered that go from any [[vertex]] to _itself_. Accordingly, there are _no_ such labeled edges in [[Feynman diagrams]] (def. \ref{FeynmanDiagram}):

<center>
  <img src="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/tadpole.png" width="70">
</center>

In [[pQFT]] these diagrams are called _[[tadpoles]]_, and their non-appearance is considered part of the _[[Feynman rules]]_ (prop. \ref{FeynmanPerturbationSeriesAwayFromCoincidingPoints}).
Via prop. \ref{FeynmanPerturbationSeriesAwayFromCoincidingPoints} this condition reflects the nature of the [[star product]] ([this def.](star+product#PropagatorStarProduct)) which always contracts _different_ [[tensor product]] factors with the [[Feynman propagator]] before taking their pointwise product.

Beware that in [[graph theory]] these [[tadpoles]] are called "[[loops]]", while here in [[pQFT]] a "loop" in a [[planar graph]] refers instead to what in [[graph theory]] is called a _[[face]]_ of the graph, see the discussion of _[[loop order]]_ in prop. \ref{FeynmanDiagramLoopOrder} below.

#### Effective action
 {#EffectiveAction}

We have seen that the [[Feynman perturbation series]] expresses the [[S-matrix]] as a [[formal power series]] of _[[Feynman amplitudes]]_ labeled by _[[Feynman diagrams]]_. Now the [[Feynman amplitude]] associated with a [[disjoint union]] of [[connected graph|connected]] [[Feynman diagrams]] (def. \ref{ConnectedGraphs} below) is just the product of the amplitudes of the [[connected components]] (prop. \ref{LogarithmEffectiveAction} below). This allows to re-organize the [[Feynman perturbation series]] as the ordinary [[exponential]] of the Feynman perturbation series restricted to just [[connected graph|connected]] Feynman diagrams. The latter is called the _[[effective action]]_ (def. \ref{InPerturbationTheoryActionEffective} below) because it allows to express [[vacuum expectation values]] of the [[S-matrix]] as an ordinary exponential (equation (eq:ExponentialSeffVEVOfSMatrix) below).

###### Definition
**([[effective action]])**

Let $(E_{\text{BV-BRST}}, \mathbf{L}', \Delta_H )$ be a [[relativistic field theory|relativistic]] [[free field theory|free]] [[vacuum]] according to def. \ref{VacuumFree}, let $\mathcal{S}$ be an [[S-matrix]] scheme for [[perturbative QFT]] around this vacuum (def. \ref{LagrangianFieldTheoryPerturbativeScattering}) and let

$$
  g S_{int} + j A
  \;\in\;
  LocObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})[ [ \hbar, g, h ] ]
$$

be a [[local observable]].

Recall that for each [[finite multigraph]] $\Gamma \in \mathcal{G}$ (def. \ref{Graphs}) the [[Feynman perturbation series]] for $\mathcal{S}(g S_{int} + j A)$ (example \ref{FeynmanPerturbationSeries})

$$
  \mathcal{S}(g S_{int} + j A)
  \;=\;
  \underset{\Gamma \in \mathcal{G}}{\sum}
    \Gamma\left( (g S_{int} + j A)_{i = 1}^{v(\Gamma)} \right)
$$

contributes with a [[renormalization|("re"-)nromalized]] [[Feynman amplitude]] $\Gamma\left( (g S_{int} + j A)_{i = 1}^v\right) \in PolyObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})((\hbar))[ [ g, j ] ]$.

We say that the corresponding _[[effective action]]_ is $i \hbar$ times the sub-series

$$
  \label{ExpansionEffectiveAction}
  S_{eff}
  \;\coloneqq\;
  i \hbar
  \underset{\Gamma \in \mathcal{G}_{conn}}{\sum}
  \Gamma\left( (g S_{int} + j A)_{i = 1}^{v(\Gamma)} \right)
  \;\in\;
  PolyObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})((\hbar))[ [ g, j ] ]
$$

of [[Feynman amplitudes]] that are labeled only by the _[[connected graphs]]_  $\Gamma \in \mathcal{G}_{conn} \subset \mathcal{G}$ (def. \ref{ConnectedGraphs}).

=--

The terminology "effective action" is due to the following fact:

+-- {: .num_prop #LogarithmEffectiveAction}
###### Proposition
**([[effective action]] is [[logarithm]] of [[S-matrix]])**

Let $(E_{\text{BV-BRST}}, \mathbf{L}', \Delta_H )$ be a [[relativistic field theory|relativistic]] [[free field theory|free]] [[vacuum]] according to def. \ref{VacuumFree}, let $\mathcal{S}$ be an [[S-matrix]] scheme for [[perturbative QFT]] around this vacuum (def. \ref{LagrangianFieldTheoryPerturbativeScattering}) and let

$$
  g S_{int} + j A
  \;\in\;
  LocObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})[ [ \hbar, g, h ] ]
$$

be a [[local observable]] and let

$$
  S_{eff} \;\in\; PolyObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})((\hbar))[ [ g, j] ]
$$

be the corresponding [[effective action]] (def. \ref{InPerturbationTheoryActionEffective}).

Then then [[S-matrix]] for $g S_{int} + j A$ is the [[exponential]] of the [[effective action]] with respect to the pointwise product $(-)\cdot (-)$ of observables ([this def.](A+first+idea+of+quantum+field+theory#Observable)):

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \mathcal{S}(g S_{int} + j A)
    & =
    \exp_\cdot\left( \tfrac{1}{i \hbar} S_{eff}  \right)
    \\
    & \coloneqq
    1
      +
    \frac{1}{i \hbar} S_{eff}
      +
    \frac{1}{(i \hbar)^2} S_{eff} \cdot S_{eff}
      +
    \frac{1}{(i \hbar)^3} S_{eff} \cdot S_{eff} \cdot S_{eff}
      +
    \cdots
  \end{aligned}
$$

Moreover, this relation passes to the [[vacuum expectation values]]:

$$
  \label{ExponentialSeffVEVOfSMatrix}
  \begin{aligned}
    \left\langle
      {\, \atop \,}
      \mathcal{S}(g S_{int} + j A)
      {\, \atop \,}
    \right\rangle
    & =
    \left\langle
      {\, \atop \,}
      \exp\left(
        \tfrac{1}{i \hbar} S_{eff}
      \right)
      {\, \atop \,}
    \right\rangle
    \\
    & =
    e^{\tfrac{1}{i \hbar} \langle S_{eff}\rangle}
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

Conversely the [[vacuum expectation value]] of the [[effective action]] is to the [[logarithm]] of that of the S-matrix:

$$
  \left\langle
    S_{eff}
  \right\rangle
  \;=\;
  i \hbar
  \,
  \ln
  \left\langle
    \mathcal{S}(g S_{int} + j A)
  \right\rangle
  \,.
$$

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By prop. \ref{TimeOrderedProductAwayFromDiagonal} the contributions to the S-matrix away from coinciding interaction points are given by the [[star product]] induced by the [[Feynman propagator]], and specifically, by prop. \ref{FeynmanPerturbationSeriesAwayFromCoincidingPoints}, the [[Feynman amplitudes]] are given this way. Now by definition of the star product ([this def.](star+product#PropagatorStarProduct)) it is given by first contracting with powers of the [[Feynman propagator]] and then multiplying all resulting terms with the pointwise product of observables. From this and the nature of the combinatorial factor in the definition of the [[Feynman amplitudes]] (prop. \ref{FeynmanPerturbationSeriesAwayFromCoincidingPoints}) it is clear that for

$$
  \Gamma
    \;=\;
  \Gamma_1
    \sqcup
  \Gamma_2
    \sqcup
    \cdots
    \sqcup
  \Gamma_n
  \;\in\; \mathcal{G}
$$

a [[disjoint union]] of graphs (def. \ref{ConnectedGraphs}), then then corresponding [[Feynman amplitudes]] multiply by the pointwise product

$$
  \Gamma(g S_{int} + j A)
  \;=\;
  \Gamma_1\left( (g S_{int} + j A)_{i = 1}^{v(\Gamma_1)}\right)
   \cdot
  \Gamma_2\left( (g S_{int} + j A)_{i = 1}^{v(\Gamma_2)} \right)
    \cdot
    \cdots
    \cdot
  \Gamma_n\left( (g S_{int} + j A)_{i = 1}^{v(\Gamma_n)} \right)
  \,.
$$

This implies that the summands in the $n$th powers of $\frac{1}{i \hbar}$ times the effective action are precisely the Feynman amplitudes of Feynman diagrams with $n$ [[connected components]], where each such appears with multiplicity given by the [[factorial]] of $n$:

$$
  \frac{1}{n!}
  \left(
    \frac{1}{i \hbar}
    S_{eff}
  \right)^n
  \;=\;
  \Gamma(g S_{int} + j A)
  \underset{
     { \Gamma = \underoverset{j = 1}{n}{\sqcup} \Gamma_j }
     \atop
     { \Gamma_j \in \mathcal{G}_{conn} }
  }{\sum}
  \,.
$$

It follows that

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \exp_\cdot\left(
      \frac{1}{i \hbar} S_{int}
    \right)
    & =
    \underset{n \in \mathbb{N}}{\sum}
    \underset{
       { \Gamma = \underoverset{j = 1}{n}{\sqcup} \Gamma_j }
       \atop
       { \Gamma_j \in \mathcal{G}_{conn} }
    }{\sum}
    \Gamma\left( (g S_{int} + j A)_{i = 1}^{v(\Gamma)} \right)
    \\
    & =
    \underset{\Gamma \in \mathcal{G}}{\sum}
    \Gamma\left( (g S_{int} + j A)_{i = 1}^{v(\Gamma)} \right)
  \end{aligned}
$$

yields the [[Feynman perturbation series]] by expressing it as a series (re-)organized by number of [[connected components]] of the [[Feynman diagrams]].

To conclude the proof it is now sufficient to observe that taking [[vacuum expectation values]] of [[polynomial observables]] respects the pointwise product of observables

$$
  \left\langle A_1 \cdot A_2 \right\rangle
  \;=\;
  \left\langle
    A_1
  \right\rangle
  \,
  \left\langle
    A_2
  \right\rangle
$$

because the [[Hadamard vacuum state]] $\langle -\rangle \colon PolyObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})[ [ \hbar, g, j] ]  \to \mathbb{C}[ [\hbar, g, j ] ]$ simply picks the zero-order monomial term, by [this prop.](Wick+algebra#WickAlgebraCanonicalState).

+-- {: .num_prop #FeynmanDiagramLoopOrder}
###### Proposition
**([[loop order]] and [[tree level]] of [[Feynman diagrams]])**

Let $\Gamma$ be a [[finite multigraph]] (def. \ref{Graphs}) which is [[planar graph|planar]] and [[connected graph|connected]] (def. \ref{ConnectedGraphs}). Then the order of $\hbar$ at which its [[Feynman amplitude]] (def. \ref{FeynmanPerturbationSeriesAwayFromCoincidingPoints}) contributes in the [[effective action]] (def. \ref{InPerturbationTheoryActionEffective}) is

$$
  \hbar^{L(\Gamma)}
  \,,
$$

where $L(\Gamma) \in \mathbb{N}$ is the number of _[[faces]]_ of the [[planar graph]] $\Gamma$, here called the _number of loops_ of the diagram.

Accordingly, the order in $\hbar$ at which the [[Feynman amplitude]] of a [[planar graph|planar]] [[connected graph|connected]] [[Feynman diagram]] contributes is often referred to as the _loop order_.

(Beware the terminology clash with [[graph theory]], see the discussion of [[tadpoles]] in remark \ref{Tadpoles}.)

Since a [[graph]] without loops, in this sense, is called a _[[tree]]_, contributions at loop order $L(\Gamma) = 0$, hence those that contribute in the _[[classical limit]]_ $\hbar \to 0$, are often called the _[[tree level]]_ contributions.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


By def. \ref{LagrangianFieldTheoryPerturbativeScattering} the explicit $\hbar$-dependence of the [[S-matrix]] is

$$
  \mathcal{S}
  \left(
    S_{int}
  \right)
  \;=\;
  \underset{k \in \mathbb{N}}{\sum}
    \frac{1}{k!}
    \frac{1}{(i \hbar)^k}
    T( \underset{k \, \text{factors}}{\underbrace{S_{int}, \cdots,  S_{int}}} )
$$

and by prop. \ref{TimeOrderedProductAwayFromDiagonal} the further $\hbar$-dependence of the [[time-ordered product]] $T(\cdots)$ is

$$
  T(S_{int}, S_{int})
  \;=\;
  prod \circ
  \exp\left(
    \hbar
    \left\langle
      \Delta_F,
      \frac{\delta}{\delta \mathbf{\Phi}}
        \otimes
      \frac{\delta}{\delta \mathbf{\Phi}}
    \right\rangle
  \right)
 ( S_{int} \otimes S_{int} )
  \,,
$$

By the [[Feynman rules]] (prop. \ref{FeynmanPerturbationSeriesAwayFromCoincidingPoints}) this means that

1. each [[vertex]] of the Feynman diagram contributes a power $\hbar^{-1}$;

1. each [[edge]] of the Feynman diagram contributes a power $\hbar^1$.

If we write

$$
  E(\Gamma), V(\Gamma) \;\in\; \mathcal{N}
$$

for the total number of [[vertices]] and [[edges]], respectively, in $\Gamma$, this means that $\Gamma$ contributes at the power

$$
  \hbar^{E(\Gamma) - V(\Gamma)}
  \,.
$$

So far this holds for arbitrary $\Gamma$. Now using the assumption that $\Gamma$ is [[planar graph|planar]], then the formula for the _[[Euler characteristic of planar graphs]]_ says that

$$
  E(\Gamma) - V(\Gamma)
  \;=\;
  L(\Gamma) - 1
  \,.
$$

Hence $\hbar^{L(\Gamma)- 1}$ is the order of $\hbar$ at which $\Gamma$ contributes to the [[scattering matrix]] expressed as the [[Feynman perturbation series]].

Finally, the [[effective action]], by definition (eq:ExpansionEffectiveAction), has the same contributions (for connected Feynman diagrams) but multiplied by another power of $\hbar^1$. This yields the claim.

### In functorial quantum field theory

At least the _idea_ of the S-matrix is very explicit in the Atiyah-Segal picture of _functorial QFT_ ([[FQFT]]).

Here a quantum field theory is given by a [[functor]]

$$
 Z \colon Bord_d^S \longrightarrow Vect
$$

from a suitable [[category of cobordisms]] to a suitable [[category]] of [[vector spaces]].

* To a codimension-1 slice $M_{d-1}$ of space this assigns a vector space $Z(M_{d-1})$ -- the (Hilbert) [[space of quantum states]] over $M_{d-1}$;

* to a [[spacetime]]/[[worldvolume]] manifold $M$ with [[boundaries]] $\partial M$ one assigns the quantum propagator which is the linear map $Z(M) : Z(\partial_{in} M) \to Z(\partial_{out} M)$ that takes incoming states to outgoing states via propagation along the spacetime/worldvolume $M$. This $Z(M)$ is alternatively known as the  the _[[scattering amplitude]]_ or _S-matrix_ for propagation from $\partial_{in}M$ to $\partial_{out}M$ along a process of shape $M$.

Now for genuine [[topological field theories]] all spaces of quantum states are [[finite number|finite]] [[dimension|dimensional]] and hence we can equivalently consider the [[dual vector space]] (using that finite dimensional vector spaces form a [[compact closed category]]). Doing so the propagator map

$$
  Z(M) : Z(\partial_{in}M) \to Z(\partial_{out}M)
$$

equivalently becomes a linear map of the form

$$
  \mathbb{C} \to Z(\partial_{out}M) \otimes Z(\partial_{in}M)^\ast = Z(\partial M)
  \,.
$$

Notice that such a linear map from the canonical 1-dimensional complex vector space $\mathbb{C}$ to some other vector space is equivalently just a choice of element in that vector space. It is in this sense that $Z(M)$ is equivalently a vector in $Z(\partial_{out}M) \otimes Z(\partial_{in}M)^\ast = Z(\partial M)$.

In this form in physics the propagator is usually called the _[[correlator]]_ or _[[n-point function]]_ .

Segal's axioms for [[FQFT]] ([[CFT]] in his case) were originally explicitly about the propagators/S-matrices, while Atiyah formulated it in terms of the correlators this way. Both perspectives go over into each other under duality as above.

Notice that this kind of discussion is not restricted to topological field theory. For instance already plain quantum mechanics is usefully formulated this way, that's the point of [[finite quantum mechanics in terms of dagger-compact categories]].

## History
 {#History}


In the 1960s there was a prominent proposal, around [[Geoffrey Chew]], that ([[perturbative quantum field theory|perturbative]]) [[quantum field theory]] should be _defined_ by [[axiom|axiomatizing]] properties of the S-matrix _without_ explicit reference to [[field (physics)|fields]] on [[spacetime]].

Here _analycity_ (or more general the _crossing property_) of the S-matrix reflects its [[causal factorization]], and hence this is often referred to as the _analytic S-matrix_ (see [Eden-Ladshoff-Olive-Polkinhorne 66](#EdenLadshoffOlivePolkinhorne66)).

This is a radical perspective where no [[spacetime]] geometry and physical fields are made explicit, but where the entire physics is encoded by what quantum particles see that scatter through it.

Historically, this S-matrix "bootstrap" approach fell out of fashion with the success of the [[quark]] model in  [[quantum chromodynamics]], which is a [[local field theory|local]] [[Lagrangian field theory]] ([[Yang-Mills theory]]) defined in terms of [[field (physics)|fields]] on [[spacetime]].

See also the discussion in ([Chew 70](#Chew70), [Schroer 11](#Schroer11)).

But later [[perturbative string theory]] revived the axiomatic S-matrix perspective. In general, perturbative string theory is not defined by a geometric spacetime background. Instead the background is algebraically encoded by a [[2d SCFT]] ("[[2-spectral triple]]") and the [[string perturbation series]] is a formula that translates this into an S-matrix. Spacetime physics then is whatever is seen by string scattering processes (see also at _[string theory FAQ -- What are the equations of string theory?](string%20theory%20FAQ#WhatAreTheEquations)_).

More recently, the S-matrix perspective becomes fashionable also in [[Yang-Mills theory]], at least in [[super Yang-Mills theory]]: one observes that the theory enjoys good structures in its scattering amplitudes which are
essentially invisible in the vast summation of [[Feynman diagrams]] that extract the S-matrix from the [[action functional]]. Instead there are entirely different mathematical structures that encode at least some sub-class of scattering amplitudes (see at _[[amplituhedron]]_).

{#RonMaimonOnHistory} From [this physics.SE comment](http://physics.stackexchange.com/a/15164/5603) by [[Ron Maimon]]:

> The history of [[physics]] cannot be well understood without appreciating the unbelievable antagonism between the [[Geoffrey Chew|Chew]]/[[Stanley Mandelstam|Mandelstam]]/[[Vladimir Gribov|Gribov]] S-matrix camp, and the [[Steven Weinberg|Weinberg]]/[[Sheldon Glashow|Glashow]]/[[Alexander Polyakov|Polyakov]] [[quantum field theory|Field theory]] camp. The two sides hated each other, did not hire each other, and did not read each other, at least not in the west. The only people that straddled both camps were older folks and Russians--- [[Murray Gell-Mann|Gell-Mann]] more than [[Lev Landau|Landau]] (who believed the [[Landau pole]] implied the S-matrix), Gribov and Migdal more than anyone else in the west other than [[Murray Gell-Mann|Gell-Mann]] and [[Kenneth Wilson|Wilson]]. Wilson did his PhD in S-matrix theory, for example, as did [[David Gross]] (under Chew).

> In the 1970s, S-matrix theory just plain died. All practitioners jumped ship rapidly in 1974, with the triple-whammy of [[effective field theory|Wilsonian field theory]], the discovery of the Charm [[quark]], and [[asymptotic freedom]]. These results killed S-matrix theory for thirty years. Those that jumped ship include all the original [[string theory|string theorists]] who stayed employed: notably [[Gabriele Veneziano|Veneziano]], who was convinced that [[gauge theory]] was right when [[Gerard 't Hooft|t'Hooft]] showed that [[AdS-CFT|large-N gauge fields]] give the string topological expansion, and [[Leonard Susskind|Susskind]], who didn't mention Regge theory after the early 1970s. Everybody stopped studying [[string theory]] except [[Joël Scherk|Scherk]] and [[John Schwarz|Schwarz]], and Schwarz was protected by
[[Murray Gell-Mann|Gell-Mann]], or else he would never have been tenured and funded.

> This sorry history means that not a single S-matrix theory course is taught in the curriculum today, nobody studies it except a few theorists of advanced age hidden away in particle accelerators, and the main S-matrix theory, [[string theory]], is not properly explained and remains completely enigmatic even to most physicists. There were some good reasons for this --- some S-matrix people said silly things about the consistency of quantum field theory --- but to be fair, [[quantum field theory]] people said equally silly things about S-matrix theory.

> [[Steven Weinberg|Weinberg]] came up with these heuristic arguments in the 1960s, which convinced him that S-matrix theory was a dead end, or rather, to show that it was a tautological synonym for quantum field theory. Weinberg was motivated by models of pion-nucleon interactions, which was a hot S-matrix topic in the early 1960s. The solution to the problem is the [[chiral symmetry breaking]] models of the pion condensate, and these are [[effective field theories]].

> Building on this result, Weinberg became convinced that the only real solution to the S-matrix was a field theory of some particles with spin. He still says this every once in a while, but it is dead wrong. The most charitable interpretation is that every S-matrix has a field theory limit, where all but a finite number of particles decouple, but this is not true either (consider [[little string theory]]). String theory exists, and there are non-field theoretic S-matrices, namely all the ones in [[string theory]], including [[little string theory]] in (5+1)d, which is non-gravitational.

From ([Weinberg 09, p. 11](#Weinberg09)):

> I offered this in my 1979 paper as what [[Arthur Wightman]] would call a [[folk theorem]]: "if one writes down the most general possible [[Lagrangian]], including all terms consistent with assumed [[symmetry]] principles, and then calculates [[scattering amplitudes|matrix elements]] with this Lagrangian to any given order of [[perturbation theory]], the result will simply be the most general possible S-matrix consistent with perturbative unitarity, analyticity, [[cluster decomposition]], and the assumed symmetry properties."

> There was an interesting irony in this. I had been at Berkeley from 1959 to 1966, when [[Geoffrey Chew]] and his collaborators were elaborating a program for calculating S-matrix elements for [[strong nuclear force|strong interaction]] processes by the use of unitarity, analyticity, and Lorentz invariance, without reference to [[quantum field theory]]. I found it an attractive philosophy, because it relied only on a minimum of principles, all well established. Unfortunately, the S-matrix theorists were never able to develop a reliable method of calculation, so I worked instead on other things, including [[current algebra]]. Now in 1979 I realized that the assumptions of S-matrix theory, supplemented by chiral invariance, were indeed all that are needed at low energy, but the most convenient way of implementing these assumptions in actual calculations was by good old quantum field theory, which the S-matrix theorists had hoped to supplant.

## Idea

In [[quantum field theory]] a _[[scattering amplitude]]_ or _scattering matrix_, usually just _S-matrix_ for short, encodes the [[probability amplitudes]] for scatterings processes of [[particles]] off each other.

### General idea

Every [[Lagrangian field theory|Lagrangian]] [[perturbative quantum field theory]] has an S-matrix associated with its (after [[renormalization]]), usually thought of as a [[perturbation series]] over [[Feynman diagrams]] extracted from the [[Lagrangian density]]. The rigorous construction of this as an [[operator-valued distribution]] is the content of _[[causal perturbation theory]]_ ([Epstein-Glaser 73](#EpsteinGlaser73)).

But there are also S-matrices not arising from a local field theory, for instance the [[string scattering amplitudes]].

There have been attempts to _define_ [[perturbative quantum field theory]] by directly [[axiom|axiomatizing]] properties of the S-matrix, without requiring concepts of [[field (physics)|fields]] in [[spacetime]]. This perspective goes back to ([Heisenberg 43](#Heisenberg43)) and was vocally promoted in [[Geoffrey Chew]]'s "bootstrap program" (a textbook account is in [Eden-Ladshoff-Olive-Polkinhorne 66](#EdenLadshoffOlivePolkinhorne66)).

In the [[field theory]]-picture the crucial condition on the S-matrix is its [[causal additivity]] (def. \ref{LagrangianFieldTheoryPerturbativeScattering} below) which reflects the [[microcausality]] of [[quantum observables]] (prop. \ref{PerturbativeQuantumObservablesIsLocalnet} below), whence the name "[[causal perturbation theory]]".

{#TheAnalyticSMatrix} This [[causality]] of the S-matrix, when understood in terms of underlying [[spacetime]] and [[field (physics)|fields]], is supposed to be detected more abstractly by the S-matrix being a suitable [[analytic function]] of the [[wave vectors]] of the scattering asymptotic states ([Newton 82, 10.3.3](#Newton82), [Arkani-Hamed et al. 06](#AAHDNR06)), often refereed to via "dispersion relations" (e.g. [Eden-Ladshoff-Olive-Polkinhorne 66 (1.1.1)-(1.1.5)](#EdenLadshoffOlivePolkinhorne66), [Gribov 69, 1.1.2](#Gribov69)). Since thereby analyticity is recognized as the crucial property of the S-matrix in the spacetime/field-independent axiomatization, this is often referred to as "the analytic S-matrix" (e.g. [Eden-Ladshoff-Olive-Polkinhorne 66](#EdenLadshoffOlivePolkinhorne66)). More specifically [[microcausality]] is what induces "crossing symmetry" of the S-matrix ([Weinberg 95, section 10.8](#Weinberg95)).

The perception of the nature of the S-matrix as a primary or derived concept in the foundations of quantum field theory has a convoluted (and ongoing) history, see [below](#History).

### The S-matrix bootstrap

From [this Physics.SE comment](https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/17973/5603) by [[Ron Maimon]]:

The idea of the S-matrix "bootstrap" is that one may compute the S-matrix directly from suitable axioms without using a [[local field theory|local]] [[quantum field theory]] involving [[field (physics)|fields]] on [[spacetime]]. In order for the theory to be interesting, the S-matrix should obey certain properties abstracted away from field theory

* It should be unitary
* It should be Lorentz invariant
* It should be crossing invariant: this means that the antiparticle scattering
should be described by the analytic continuation of the particle scattering
* It should obey the Landau property--- that all singularities of scattering are poles and cuts corresponding to exchange of collections of real particles on shell.
* It should obey ([[Stanley Mandelstam|Mandelstam]]) analyticity: the amplitude should be writable as an integral over the imaginary part of the cut discontinuity from production of physical particles. Further, this cut discontinuity itself can be expanded in terms of another cut discontinuity (these are the mysterious then and still mysterious now double dispersion relations of Mandelstam).

This is a sketchy summary, because each of these conditions is involved. The unitarity condition in particular, is very difficult, because it is so nonlinear. The only practical way to solve it is in a perturbation series which starts with weakly interacting nearly stable particles (described by poles of the S-matrix) which exchange each other (the exchange picture is required by crossing, and the form of the scattering is fixed by the Landau and Mandelstam analyticity, once you know the spectrum).

The "Bootstrap property" is then the following heuristic idea, which is included in the above formal relations:

* The particles and interactions which emerge as the spectrum of the S-matrix from the scattering of states, including their binding together into bound states, should be the same spectrum of particles that come in ias in-states.

This is a heuristic idea, because it is only saying that the S-matrix is consistent, and the formal consistency relations are those above. But the bootstrap was a slogan that implied that all the consistency conditions were not yet discovered, and there might be more.

This idea was very inspirational to many great people in the 1960s, because it was an approach to strong interactions that could accommodate non-field theories of infinitely many particle types of high spin, without postulating constituent particles (like quarks and gluons).

### Regge theory

Continuing with [this Physics.SE comment](https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/17973/5603) by [[Ron Maimon]]:


The theory above doesn't get you anywhere without the following additional stuff. If you don't do this, you end up starting with a finite number of particles and interactions, and then you end up in effective field theory land. The finite-number-of-particles version of S-matrix theory is a dead end, or at least, it is equivalent to effective field theory, and this was understood in the late 1960s by Weinberg, and others, and this led S-matrix theory to die. This was the road the Chew travelled on, and the end of this road must be very personally painful to him.

But there is another road for S-matrix theory which is much more interesting, so that Chew should not be disheartened. You need to know that the scattering amplitude is analytic in the angular momentum of the exchanged particles, so that the particles lie on Regge trajectories, which give their angular momentum as a function of their mass squared, s.

Where the Regge trajectories hit an integer angular momentum, you see a particle. The trajectory interpolates the particle mass-squared vs. angular momentum graph, and it gives the asymptotic scattering caused by exchanging all these particles _together_. This scattering can be softer than the exchange of any one of these particles, because exchanging a particle of high spin necessarily has very singular scattering amplitudes at high energy. The Regge trajectory cancels out this growth with an infinite series of higher particles which soften the blowup, and lead to a power-law near-beam scattering at an angle which shrinks to zero as the energy goes to infinity in a way determined by the shape of the trajectory.

So the Regge bootstrap adds the following conditions

* All the particles in the theory lie on Regge trajectories, and the scattering of these particles is by Regge theory.

This condition is the most stringent, because you can't deform a pure Regge trajectory by adding a single particle--- you have to add new trajectories. The following restriction was suggested by experiment

* The Regge trajectories are linear in s

This was suggested by Chew and Frautschi from the resonances known in 1960! The straight lines mostly had two points. The next condition is also ad-hoc and experimental

* The Regge slope is universal (for mesons), it's the same for all the trajectories.

There are also "pomerons" in this approach which are not mesons, which have a different Regge slopem but ignore this for now.

Finally, there is the following condition, which was experimentally motivated, but has derivations by Mandelstam and others from more theoretical foundations (although this is S-matrix theory, it doesn't have axioms, so derivation is a loose word).

* The exchange of trajectories is via the s-channel or the t-channel, but not both. It is double counting to exchange the same trajectories in both channels.

These conditions essentially uniquely determine Veneziano's amplitude and bosonic string theory. Adding Fermion trajectories requires Ramond style supersymmetry, and then the road to string theory is to reinterpret all these conditions in the string picture which emerges.

String theory incorporates and gives concrete form to all the boostrap ideas, so much so that anyone doing bootstrap today is doing string theory, especially since AdS/CFT showed why the bootstrap is relevant to gauge theories like QCD in the first place.

The highlight of Regge theory is the Reggeon calculus, a full diagrammatic formalism, due to Gribov, for calculating the exchange of pomerons in a perturbation framework. This approach inspired a 2d parton picture of QCD which is studied heavily by several people, notably, Gribov, Lipatov, Feynman (as part of his parton program), and more recently Rajeev. Nearly every problem here is open and interesting.

For an example of a reasearch field which (partly) emerged from this, one of the major motivations for taking PT quantum mechanics seriously was the strange non-Hermitian form of the Reggeon field theory Hamiltonian.

### Pomerons and Reggeon Field theory

Further from [this Phyics.SE comment](https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/17973/5603) by [[Ron Maimon]]:

The main success of this picture is describing near-beam scattering, or diffractive scattering, at high energies. The idea here is that there is a Regge trajectory which is called the pomeron, which dominates high energy scattering, and which has no quantum numbers. This means that any particle will exchange the pomeron at high energies, so that p-pbar and p-p total cross sections will become equal.

This idea is spectacularly confirmed by mid 90's measurements of total p-p and p-pbar cross sections, and in a better political climate, this would have won some boostrap theorists a Nobel prize. Instead, it is never mentioned.

The pomeron in string theory becomes the closed string, which includes the graviton, which couples universally to stress energy. The relation between the closed string and the QCD pomeron is the subject of active research, associated with the names of Lipatov, Polchinski, Tan, and collaborators.

Regge scattering also predicts near beam scattering amplitudes from the sum of the appropriate trajectory function you can exchange. These predictions have been known to roughly work since the late 1960s.

### In quantum mechanics
 {#InQuantumMechanics}

In [[quantum mechanics]], let $\mathcal{H}$ be some [[Hilbert space]] and let

$$
  H = H_{free} + V
$$

be an Hermitian operator, thought of as a [[Hamiltonian]], decomposed as the [[sum]] of a free part ([[kinetic energy]]) and an interaction part ([[potential energy]]).

For example for a  [[non-relativistic particle]] of [[mass]] $m$ propagating on the [[line]] subject to a [[potential energy]] $V_{pot} \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, then $\mathcal{H} = L^2(\mathbb{R})$ is the Hilbert space space of [[square integrable functions]] and

$$
  H
   =
  \underset{H_{free}}{\underbrace{\tfrac{- \hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial^2 x}}}
    +
  V
  \,,
$$

where $V = V_{pot}(x)$ is the operator of multiplying square integrable functions with the given potential energy function.

Now for

$$
  \array{
    \mathbb{R} &\overset{\vert \psi (-)\rangle }{\longrightarrow}& \mathcal{H}
   \\
   t &\mapsto& \vert \psi(t) \rangle
  }
$$

a one-parameter family of [[quantum states]], the [[Schrödinger equation]] for this state reads

$$
  \frac{d}{d t} \vert \psi(t) \rangle
  \;=\;
  \tfrac{1}{i \hbar} H \vert \psi\rangle
  \,.
$$

It is easy to solve this [[differential equation]] formally via its [[Green function]]: for $\vert \psi \rangle \in \mathcal{H}$ any state, then the unique solution $\vert \psi(-) \rangle$ to the Schr&#246;dinger equation subject to $\vert \psi(0) \rangle = \vert \psi \rangle$ is

$$
  \vert \psi(t)\rangle_S \coloneqq \exp( \tfrac{t}{i \hbar} H ) \vert \psi \rangle
  \,.
$$

(One says that this is the solution "in the [[Schrödinger picture]]", whence the subscript.)

However, if $H$ is sufficiently complicated, it may still be very hard to extract from this expression a more explicit formula for $\vert \psi(t) \rangle$, such as, in the example of the free particle on the line, its expression as a function ("[[wave function]]") of $x$ and $t$.

But assume that the analogous expression for $H_{free}$ alone is well understood, hence that the operator

$$
  U_{S,free}(t_1, t_2) \coloneqq \exp\left({\tfrac{t_2 - t_1}{i \hbar} H_{free}}\right)
$$

is sufficiently well understood. The "[[interaction picture]]" is a way to decompose the Schr&#246;dinger equation such that its dependence on $V$ gets separated from its dependence on $H_{free}$ in a way that admits to treat $H_{int}$ in [[perturbation theory]].

Namely define analogously

\[
  \label{StateInTheInteractionPicture}
  \begin{aligned}
    \vert \psi(t)\rangle_I
     &\coloneqq
     \exp\left({\tfrac{- t}{i \hbar} H_{free}}\right) \vert \psi(t)\rangle_S
    \\
    & = \exp\left({\tfrac{- t}{i \hbar} H_{free}}\right)
        \exp\left({ \tfrac{+ t}{i \hbar} H} \right)\vert \psi \rangle
    \\
    & = \exp\left({\tfrac{- t}{i \hbar} H_{free}}\right)
        \exp\left({\tfrac{t}{i \hbar} H_{free} + \tfrac{t}{i \hbar} V} \right)\vert \psi \rangle   \end{aligned}
  \,.
\]

This is called the solution of the Schr&#246;dinger equation "in the [[interaction picture]]", whence the subscript. Its definition may be read as the result of propagating the actual solution $\vert \psi(-)\rangle_S$ at time $t$ back to time $t = 0$, but using just the free Hamiltonian, hence with "the interaction switched off".

Notice that if the operator $V$ were to commute with $H_{free}$ (which it does not in all relevant examples) then we would simply have $\vert \psi(t)\rangle_I = \exp( \tfrac{t}{i \hbar } V ) \vert \psi\rangle$, hence then the solution (eq:StateInTheInteractionPicture) in the [[interaction picture]] would be the result of "propagating" the initial conditions using _only_ the interaction. Now since $V$ may not be assumed to commute with $H_{free}$, the actual form of $\vert \psi(-) \rangle_{I}$ is more complicated. But _infinitesimally_ it remains true that $\vert \psi(-)\rangle_I$ is propagated this way, not by the plain operator $V$, though, but by $V$ viewed in the [[Heisenberg picture]] of the free theory. This is the content of the differential equation (eq:DifferentialEquationInInteractionPicture) below.

But first notice that this will indeed be useful: If an explicit expression for the "state in the [[interaction picture]]" (eq:StateInTheInteractionPicture) is known, then the assumption that also the operator $\exp\left({\tfrac{t}{i \hbar} H_{free}}\right)$ is sufficiently well understood implies that the actual solution

$$
  \vert \psi(t) \rangle_S = \exp\left({\tfrac{t}{i \hbar} H_{free}}\right) \vert \psi(t) \rangle_I
$$

is under control. Hence the question now is how to find $\vert \psi(-)\rangle_I$ given its value at some time $t$. (It is conventional to consider this for $t \to \pm \infty$, see (eq:SMatrixInQuantumMechanics) below.)

Now it is clear from the construction and using the [[product law]] for [[differentiation]], that $\vert \psi(-)\rangle_S$ satisfies the following [[differential equation]] ("[[Schrödinger equation]] in [[interaction picture]]"):

\[
  \label{DifferentialEquationInInteractionPicture}
  \frac{d}{d t} \vert \psi(t) \rangle
  \;=\;
  V_I(t) \vert \psi(t)\rangle_I
  \,,
\]

where

$$
  V_I(t)
    \coloneqq
  \exp\left( -\tfrac{t}{i \hbar} H_{free} \right)
    V
  \exp\left( +\tfrac{t}{i \hbar} H_{free} \right)
$$

is known as the [[interaction]] term $V$ "viewed in the [[interaction picture]]". But in fact this is just $V$ "viewed in the [[Heisenberg picture]]", but for the _free_ theory. By our running assumption that the free theory is well understood, also $V_I(t)$ is well understood, and hence all that remains now is to find a sufficiently concrete solution to equation (eq:DifferentialEquationInInteractionPicture). This is the heart of working in the interaction picture.

Solutions to equations of the "[[parallel transport]]"-type such as (eq:DifferentialEquationInInteractionPicture) are given by [[time-ordered product|time-ordering]] of Heisenberg picture operators, denoted $T$, applied to the naive exponential solution as above. This is known as the _[[Dyson formula]]_:

$$
  \label{DysonFormula}
  \vert \psi(t)\rangle_I
  \;=\;
  T\left(
    \exp\left(
      \int_{t_0}^t
        V_I(t)
        \tfrac{d t}{i \hbar}
    \right)
  \right)
  \vert \psi(t_0)\rangle
  \,.
$$

Here [[time-ordered product|time-ordering]] means

$$
  T( V_I(t_1) V_I(t_2) )
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \left\{
    \array{
      V_I(t_1) V_I(t_2) &\vert& t_1 \geq t_2
      \\
      V_I(t_2) V_I(t_1) &\vert& t_2 \geq t_1
    }
  \right.
  \,.
$$

Beware the conventional abuse of notation here: Strictly speaking time ordering acts on the [[tensor algebra]] spanned by the $\{V_I(t)\}_{t \in \mathbb{R}}$ and has to be _followed_ by taking tensor products to actual products.

In applications to [[scattering]] processes one is interest in prescribing the [[quantum state]]/[[wave function]] far in the past, hence for $t \to - \infty$, and computing its form far in the future, hence for $t \to \infty$.

The operator that sends such "asymptotic ingoing-states" $\vert \psi(-\infty) \rangle_I$ to "asymptic outgoing states" $\vert \psi(+ \infty) \rangle_I$ is hence the [[limit of a sequence|limit]]

\[
  \label{SMatrixInQuantumMechanics}
  \mathcal{S}(V_I)
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \underset{t \to \infty}{\lim}
  T\left(
    \exp\left(
      \int_{-t}^t
        V_I(t)
        \tfrac{d t}{i \hbar}
    \right)
  \right)
  \,.
\]

This limit (if it exists) is called the _scattering matrix_ or _S-matrix_, for short.

For example if $V_{I,1}$ and $V_{I,2}$ are two [[interactions]] such that the [[support]] in [[time]] of $V_{I,1}$
is _after_ the support of $V_{I,2}$:

$$
  \left\{
  \array{
    \left(t \gt t_0 \right) &\Rightarrow& V_{I,2} = 0
    \\
    \left(t \lt t_0 \right) &\Rightarrow& V_{I,1} = 0
  }
  \right.
$$

then, assuming the S-matrix for $V_{I,1}$, $V_{I,2}$ and $V_I \coloneqq V_{I,1} + V_{I,2}$ exists, the [[Dyson formula]] (eq:DysonFormula)
implies the "[[causal factorization]]"

$$
  \label{IntegralVersionSchroedingerEquationInInteractionPicture}
  \mathcal{S}(V_{I,1} + V_{I,2})
  \;=\;
  \mathcal{S}(V_{I,1}) \, \mathcal{S}(V_{I,2})
$$

Conversely, decomposing any $V_I(t)$ with the [[step function]] $\Theta$ as

$$
  V_I(t)
    \;=\;
  \underset{ \coloneqq V_{I,1}(t) }{\underbrace{V_I(t) \Theta(t-t_0)}}
   \;+\;
  \underset{ \coloneqq V_{I,2}(t) }{\underbrace{V_I(t)\Theta(t_0 - t)}}
$$

then this [[causal factorization]]-relation may be understood as the integral version of the
"[[Schrödinger equation]] in the [[interaction picture]]" (eq:DifferentialEquationInInteractionPicture).

It is this "integral-version of the [[Schrödinger equation]] in the [[interaction picture]]" (eq:IntegralVersionSchroedingerEquationInInteractionPicture) that has a fairly
evident generalization from [[quantum mechanics]] to [[relativistic field theory|relativistic]] [[perturbative quantum field theory]]
in the form of _[[causal perturbation theory]]_, def. \ref{LagrangianFieldTheoryPerturbativeScattering} below, see remark \ref{DysonCausalFactorization} below that.




### In perturbative relativistic Lagrangian QFT -- Causal perturbation theory
 {#InCausalPerturbationTheory}


In [[perturbative algebraic quantum field theory]] the broad structure of the [[interaction picture]] in [[quantum mechanics]] ([above](#InQuantumMechanics)) remains a very good guide, but various technical details have to be generalized with due care:

1. The algebra of operators in the [[Heisenberg picture]] of the free theory becomes the _[[Wick algebra]]_ of the [[free field theory]] (taking into account "normal ordering" of field operators) defined on _[[microcausal functionals]]_ built from [[operator-valued distributions]] with constraints on their [[wave front set]].

1. The [[time-ordered products]] in the [[Dyson formula]] have to be refined to [[causal locality|causally ordered]] products and the resulting product at coincident points has to be defined by [[point-extension of distributions]] -- the freedom in making this choice is the [[renormalization]] freedom ("conter-terms").

1. The sharp interaction cutoff in the [[Dyson formula]] that is hidden in the integration over $[t_0,t]$ has to be smoothed out by [[adiabatic switching]] of the interaction (making the whole S-matrix an [[operator-valued distribution]]).

Together these three points are taken care of by the axiomatization of the "[[adiabatic switching|adiabatically switched]] [[S-matrix]]" according to **[[causal perturbation theory]]**.






#### Perturbative S-Matrices
 {#PerturbativeSMatrixAndTimeOrderedProducts}

We consider here the [[axioms]] for perturbative S-matrices relative to a fixed [[relativistic field theory|relativistic]] [[free field theory|free]] [[Lagrangian field theory|Lagrangian]] [[quantum field theory|quantum field]] [[vacuum]] (def. \ref{VacuumFree} below) according to _[[causal perturbation theory]]_ (def. \ref{LagrangianFieldTheoryPerturbativeScattering} below).
Since the first of these axioms requires the S-matrix to be a formal sum of [[multilinear map|multi-]][[linear continuous functionals]], it is convenient to impose axioms on these directly: this is the axiomatics for _[[time-ordered products]]_
in def. \ref{TimeOrderedProduct} below. That these latter axioms already imply the former
is the statement of prop. \ref{TimeOrderedProductInducesPerturbativeSMatrix} below. Its proof
requires a close look at the "[[reverse-time ordered products]]" for the inverse S-matrix (def. \ref{ReverseTimeOrderedProduct} below)
and their induced reverse-causal factorization (prop. \ref{ReverseCausalFactorizationOfReverseTimeOrderedProducts} below).

$\,$

In considering [[perturbative QFT]], we are considering [[perturbation theory]] around a fixed [[free field theory|free]]
[[Lagrangian field theory|Lagrangian]] [[quantum field theory]] in a chosen [[Hadamard vacuum state]].
For convenient referencing we collect all the structure and notation that goes into this in the following definition:

+-- {: .num_defn #VacuumFree}
###### Definition
**([[free field theory|free]] [[relativistic field theory|relativistic]] [[Lagrangian field theory|Lagrangian]] [[quantum field theory|quantum field]] [[vacuum]])**

Let

1. $\Sigma$ be a [[spacetime]] (e.g. [[Minkowski spacetime]]);

1. $(E,\mathbf{L})$ a [[free field theory|free]] [[Lagrangian field theory]] ([this def.](A+first+idea+of+quantum+field+theory#FreeFieldTheory)), with [[field bundle]] $E \overset{fb}{\to} \Sigma$;

1. $\mathcal{G} \overset{fb}{\to} \Sigma$ a [[gauge parameter bundle]] for $(E,\mathbf{L})$ ([this def.](A+first+idea+of+quantum+field+theory#GaugeParameters)), with induced [[BRST-complex|BRST]]-[[reduced phase space|reduced]] [[Lagrangian field theory]] $\left( E \times_\Sigma \mathcal{G}[1], \mathbf{L} - \mathbf{L}_{BRST}\right)$ ([this example](A+first+idea+of+quantum+field+theory#LocalOffShellBRSTComplex));

1. $(E_{\text{BV-BRST}}, \mathbf{L}' - \mathbf{L}'_{BRST})$ a [[gauge fixing]] ([this def.](A+first+idea+of+quantum+field+theory#GaugeFixingLagrangianDensity)) with [[graded manifold|graded]] [[BV-BRST formalism|BV-BRST]] [[field bundle]] $E_{\text{BV-BRST}} = T^\ast_{\Sigma}[-1]\left( E\times_\Sigma \mathcal{G}[1] \times_\Sigma A \times_\Sigma A[-1]\right)$ ([this remark](A+first+idea+of+quantum+field+theory#FieldBundleBVBRST));

1. $\Delta_H \in \Gamma'( E_{\text{BV-BRST}} \boxtimes E_{\text{BV-BRST}} )$ a [[Wightman propagator]] $\Delta_H = \tfrac{i}{2} \Delta + H$ compatible with the [[causal propagator]] $\Delta$ which corresponds to the [[Green hyperbolic partial differential equation|Green hyperbolic]] [[Euler-Lagrange equation|Euler-Lagrange]] [[equations of motion]] induced by the [[gauge fixing|gauge-fixed]] [[Lagrangian density]] $\mathbf{L}'$.

Given this, we write

$$
  \left(
    {\, \atop \,}
    PolyObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})_{mc}[ [\hbar] ] \;,\;
   \star_H
   {\, \atop \,}
  \right)
$$

for the corresponding [[Wick algebra]]-[[structure]] on [[formal power series]] in $\hbar$ ([[Planck's constant]]) of [[microcausal polynomial observables]]. This is a [[star algebra]] with respect to ([[coefficient]]-wise) [[complex conjugation]].

Write

$$
  \label{HadamardVacuumStateForFreeFieldTheory}
  \array{
    PolyObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})_{mc}[ [\hbar] ]
     &\overset{\langle - \rangle}{\longrightarrow}&
    \mathbb{C}[ [\hbar] ]
    \\
    A &\mapsto& A(\Phi = 0)
  }
$$

for the induced [[Hadamard vacuum state]] ([this prop.](Wick+algebra#WickAlgebraCanonicalState)), hence the [[state on a star-algebra|state]] whose [[distribution|distributional]] [[2-point function]] is the chosen [[Wightman propagator]]:

$$
  \left\langle \mathbf{\Phi}^a(x) \mathbf{\Phi}^b(y)\right\rangle
  \;=\;
  \hbar \, \Delta_H^{a b}(x,y)
  \,.
$$

Given any [[microcausal polynomial observable]] $A \in PolyObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})_{mc}[ [ \hbar, g, j] ]$ then its value in this state is called its _free [[vacuum expectation value]]_

$$
  \left\langle
    A
  \right\rangle
  \;\in\;
  \mathbb{C}[ [ \hbar, g, j] ]
  \,.
$$

Write

$$
  \label{NormalOrderingLocalObservables}
  \array{
    LocObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})
      &\overset{\phantom{A}:(-):\phantom{A}}{\hookrightarrow}&
    PolyObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})_{mc}
    \\
    A &\mapsto& :A:
  }
$$

for the inclusion of [[local observables]] into [[microcausal polynomial observables]] ([this example](A+first+idea+of+quantum+field+theory#PointwiseProductsOfFieldObservablesAdiabaticallySwitchedIsMicrocausal)), thought of as forming [[normal-ordered products]] in the [[Wick algebra]] (by [this def.](A+first+idea+of+quantum+field+theory#NormalOrderedProductNotation)).

We denote the [[Wick algebra]]-product (the [[star product]] $\star_H$ induced by the [[Wightman propagator]] $\Delta_H$) by juxtaposition ([this def.](A+first+idea+of+quantum+field+theory#NormalOrderedProductNotation))

$$
  A_1 A_2 \;\coloneqq\; A_1 \star_H A_2
  \,.
$$

If an element $A \in PolyObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})$ has an [[inverse]] with respect to this product, we denote that by
$A^{-1}$:

$$
  A^{-1} A = 1
  \,.
$$

Finally, for $A \in LocObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})$ we write $supp(A) \subset \Sigma$ for its spacetime support ([this def.](A+first+idea+of+quantum+field+theory#SpacetimeSupport)).
For $S_1, S_2 \subset \Sigma$ two [[subsets]] of [[spacetime]] we write

$$
  S_1 {\vee\!\!\!\wedge} S_2
  \phantom{AAA}
  \left\{
    \array{
      "S_1 \, \text{does not intersect the past of} \, S_2"
      \\
      \Updownarrow
      \\
      "S_2 \, \text{does not intersect the future of} \, S_1"
    }
  \right.
$$

for the  [[causal ordering]]-[[relation]] and


$$
  S_1 {\gt\!\!\!\!\lt} S_2
  \phantom{AAA}
  \text{for}
  \phantom{AAA}
  \array{
    S_1 {\vee\!\!\!\wedge} S_2
    \\
    \text{and}
    \\
    S_2 {\vee\!\!\!\wedge} A_1
  }
$$

for _[[spacelike]] separation_.

###### Remark

For the purposes of constructing or defining the Wick algebra, the conditions on $\Delta_H$ or $H$ could be relaxed. Requiring $\Delta_H$ to be an honest [[Wightman propagator]] means that it is a distribution satisfying the [[Hadamard distribution|Hadamard wavefront condition]], as well as addition positivity and normalization requirements. Dropping the positivity and some of the normalization requirements, $\Delta_H$ is then only a _Hadamard parametrix_ for the Wightman propagator. The construction of the Wick algebra with respect to $\Delta_H$ still makes sense, but $:(-):$ can no longer be interpreted as normal ordering with respect to a fixed vacuum state. In fact, in [[locally covariant pAQFT]], the property for $\Delta_H$ to be the Wightman propagator for a state is in conflict with local covariance. On the other hand, there is no problem with selecting a locally covariant Hadamard parametrix $\Delta_H$, which allows the construction or definition of the Wick algebra to be locally covariant.

Being concerned with [[perturbative QFT|perturbation theory]] means mathematically that we consider _[[formal power series]]_
in deformation parameters $\hbar$ ("[[Planck's constant]]") and $g$ ("[[coupling constant]]"), also in $j$ ("[[source field]]"),
see also remark \ref{AsymptoticSeriesObservables}:

Write

$$

for the space of [[formal power series]] in three formal [[variables]]

1. $\hbar$ ("[[Planck's constant]]"),

1. $g$ ("[[coupling constant]]")

1. $j$ ("[[source field]]")

with  [[coefficients]] in the [[topological vector spaces]] of the [[off-shell]] polynomial [[local observables]] of the [[free field]] theory; similarly for the [[off-shell]] [[microcausal polynomial observables]]:

$$
  PolyObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})_{mc}[ [ \hbar, g, j ] ]
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \underset{ k_1, k_2, k_3 \in \mathbb{N}}{\prod}
  PolyObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})_{mc}\langle \hbar^{k_1} g^{k_2} j^{k^3}\rangle
  \,.
$$

Similary

$$
  LocObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})[ [ \hbar, g  ] ]
  \,,
   \phantom{AAA}
  PolyObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})[ [ \hbar, g  ] ]
$$

denotes the subspace for which no powers of $j$ appear, etc.

Accordingly

$$
  C^\infty_{cp}(\Sigma) \langle g \rangle
$$

denotes the be vector space of [[bump functions]] tensored with the vector space spanned by a single copy of $g$.
The elements

$$
  g_{sw} \in C^\infty_{cp}(\Sigma)\langle g \rangle
$$

may be regarded as [[spacetime]]-dependent "[[coupling constants]]" with compact support,
called _[[adiabatic switching|adiabatically switched]] couplings_.

Similarly then

$$
  LocObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})[ [ \hbar, g, j ] ]\langle g , j \rangle
$$

is the subspace of those formal power series that are at least linear in $g$ or $j$ (hence those that vanish if one sets $g,j = 0$ ).
Hence every element of this space may be written in the form

$$
  O
    =
  g S_{int} + j A
  \;\in\;
  LocObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})[ [ \hbar, g, j ] ]\langle g , j \rangle
  \,,
$$

where the notation is to suggest that we will think of the coefficient of $g$ as an ([[adiabatic switching|adiabatically switched]])
[[interaction]] [[action functional]].

In particular for

$$
  \mathbf{L}_{int}
  \;\in\;
  \Omega^{p+1,0}_\Sigma(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})[ [ \hbar , g] ]
$$

a [[formal power series]] in $\hbar$ and $g$ of [[local Lagrangian densities]], thought of as a local [[interaction]] Lagrangian, and if

$$
  g_{sw}
  \;\in\;
  C^\infty_{cp}(\Sigma) \langle g \rangle
$$

is an [[adiabatic switching|adiabatically switched]] coupling as before, then the [[transgression of variational differential forms|transgression]] of the product

$$
  g_{sw} \mathbf{L}_{int}
  \;\in\;
  \Omega^{p+1,0}_{\Sigma,cp}(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})[ [ \hbar ,g ] ]\langle g \rangle
$$

is such an [[adiabatic switching|adiabatically switched]] [[interaction]]

$$
  g S_{int}
  \;=\;
  \tau_\Sigma( g_{sw} \mathbf{L}_{int} )
  \;\in\;
  LocObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})[ [ \hbar, g] ]\langle g \rangle
  \,.
$$

We also consider the space of [[off-shell]] [[microcausal polynomial observables]] of the [[free field theory]] with formal parameters adjoined

$$
  PolyObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})_{mc} ((\hbar)) [ [ g , j] ]

which, in its $\hbar$-dependent, is the space of _[[Laurent series]]_ in $\hbar$, hence the space exhibiting also negative formal powers of $\hbar$.

###### Remark
**([[inverse|invertibility]] of the [[S-matrix]])**

The mutliplicative inverse $S(-)^{-1}$ of the perturbative [[S-matrix]] in def. \ref{LagrangianFieldTheoryPerturbativeScattering}
with respect to the [[Wick algebra]]-product indeed exists, so that the list of axioms is indeed well defined: By the axiom "perturbation" this follows with the usual formula for the multiplicative inverse of [[formal power series]] that are non-vanishing in degree 0:

If we write

$$
  \mathcal{S}(g S_{int} + j A) = 1 + \mathcal{D}(g S_{int} + j A)
$$

then

$$
  \label{InfverseOfPerturbativeSMatrix}
  \begin{aligned}
    \left(
      {\, \atop \,}
      \mathcal{S}(g S_{int} + j A)
      {\, \atop \,}
    \right)^{-1}
    &=
    \left(
      {\, \atop \,}
      1 + \mathcal{D}(g S_{int} + j A)
      {\, \atop \,}
    \right)^{-1}
    \\
    & =
    \underoverset{r = 0}{\infty}{\sum}
    \left(
      {\, \atop \,}
      -\mathcal{D}(g S_{int} + j A)
      {\, \atop \,}
    \right)^r
  \end{aligned}
$$

where the sum does exist in $PolyObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})((\hbar))[ [[ g,j ] ]$, because (by
the axiom "perturbation")
$\mathcal{D}(g S_{int} + j A)$ has vanishing coefficient in zeroth order in the formal parameters $g$ and $j$, so that
only a finite sub-sum of the formal infinite sum contributes in each order in $g$ and $j$.

This expression for the inverse of S-matrix may usefully be re-organized in terms of "rever-time ordered products" (def. \ref{ReverseTimeOrderedProduct} below), see prop. \ref{ReverseTimOrderedProductsGiveReverseSMatrix} below.

Notice that $\mathcal{S}(-g S_{int} - j A )$ is instead the inverse with respect to the [[time-ordered products]] (eq:TimeOrderedProductsInSMatrix) in that

$$
  T( \mathcal{S}(-g S_{int} -  j A ) \,,\, \mathcal{S}(g S_{int} + j A)  )
  \;=\;
  1
  \;=\;
  T( \mathcal{S}(g S_{int} + j A )  \,,\,  \mathcal{S}(-g S_{in} - j A ) )
  \,.
$$

(Since the time-ordered product is, by definition, symmetric in its arguments, the usual formula for the multiplicative inverse of
an [[exponential series]] applies).

In terms of the [[generating functions]] $\mathcal{Z}$ (def. \ref{SchemeGeneratingFunction}) the axiom "[[causal additivity]]"
on the [[S-matrix]] scheme $\mathcal{S}$ (def. \ref{LagrangianFieldTheoryPerturbativeScattering}) is equivalent to:

* ([[causal additivity]] in terms of $\mathcal{Z}$)

  For all [[local observables]] $O_0, O_1, O_2 \in LocObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})[ [\hbar, g, j] ]\otimes\mathbb{C}\langle g,j\rangle$ we have

**([[interacting field observables]] -- [[Bogoliubov's formula]])**

Let $(E_{\text{BV-BRST}}, \mathbf{L}', \Delta_H )$ be a [[relativistic field theory|relativistic]] [[free field theory|free]] [[vacuum]] according to def. \ref{VacuumFree}, let $\mathcal{S}$ be a corresponding [[S-matrix]] scheme according to def. \ref{LagrangianFieldTheoryPerturbativeScattering}, and let $g S_{int} \in LocObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})[ [ \hbar, g ] ]\langle g\rangle$ be a [[local observable]] regarded as an [[adiabatic switching|adiabatically switched]] [[interaction]]-[[action functional|functional]].

Then for $A \in LocObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})[ [\hbar , g] ]$ a [[local observable]] of the [[free field theory]],
we say that the corresponding [[local interacting field observable]]

$$
  A_{int} \in PolyObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})_{mc}[ [\hbar, g] ]
$$

is the [[coefficient]] of $j^1$ in the [[generating function]] (eq:GeneratingFunctionInducedFromSMatrix):

###### Remark
**([[interacting field observables]] are [[formal deformation quantization]])**

The [[interacting field observables]] in def. \ref{InteractingFieldObservables} are indeed [[formal power series]] in the formal parameter $\hbar$ ([[Planck's constant]]), as opposed to being more general [[Laurent series]], hence they involve no [[negative number|negative]] powers of $\hbar$ ([Dütsch-Fredenhagen 00, prop. 2 (ii)](interacting+field+observable#DuetschFredenhagen00), [Hawkins-Rejzner 16, cor. 5.2](interacting+field+observable#HawkinsRejzner16)).  This is not immediate, since by def. \ref{LagrangianFieldTheoryPerturbativeScattering} the [[S-matrix]] that they are defined from does involve negative powers of $\hbar$.

It follows in particular that the [[interacting field observables]] have a [[classical limit]] $\hbar \to 0$. Indeed they constitute a [[formal deformation quantization]] of the interacting [[Peierls-Poisson bracket]] ([Collini 16](interacting+field+algebra+of+observables#Collini16), [Hawkins-Rejzner 16](interacting+field+algebra+of+observables#HawkinsRejzner16)).

#### Conceptual remarks
 {#RemarksOnCausalPerturbationTheoryAxioms}

The simple axioms for [[S-matrices]] in [[causal perturbation theory]] (def. \ref{LagrangianFieldTheoryPerturbativeScattering}) and hence for [[interacting field observables]] (def. \ref{InteractingFieldObservables}) have a wealth of
implications and consequences. Before discussing these formally below, we here make a few informal remarks meant to put various relevant concepts into perspective:

+-- {: .num_remark #AsymptoticSeriesObservables}
###### Remark
**([[perturbative quantum field theory|perturbative QFT]] and [[asymptotic expansion]] of [[probability amplitudes]])**

Given a perturbative [[S-matrix]] scheme (def. \ref{LagrangianFieldTheoryPerturbativeScattering}), then by remark \ref{FormalPowerSeriesInteractingFieldObservables} the
[[expectation values]] of [[interacting field observables]] (def. \ref{InteractingFieldObservables}) are [[formal power series]]
in the formal parameters $\hbar$ and $g$ (which are interpreted as [[Planck's constant]], and as the [[coupling constant]], respectively):

$$
 \left\langle A_{int} \right\rangle
 \;\in\;
 \mathbb{C}[ [\hbar, g] ]
 \,.
$$

This means that there is _no_ guarantee that these series _[[convergence|converge]]_ for any [[positive real number|positive]]
value of $\hbar$ and/or $g$.
In terms of [[synthetic differential geometry]] this means that in [[perturbative QFT]] the [[deformation]] of the [[classical field theory|classical]] [[free field theory]] by quantum effects (measured by $\hbar$) and [[interactions]] (meaured by $g$) is so very tiny as to actually be [[infinitesimal]]: formal power series may be read as functions on the [[infinitesimal neighbourhood]] in a space of [[Lagrangian field theories]] at the point $\hbar = 0$, $g = 0$.

In fact, a simple argument (due to [Dyson 52](perturbative+quantum+field+theory#Dyson52))
suggests that in realistic field theories these series _never_ converge for _any_ [[positive real number|positive]] value of $\hbar$ and/or $g$. Namely convergence for $g$ would imply a [[positive real number|positive]] _[[radius of convergence]]_ around $g = 0$, which would imply convergence also for $-g$ and even for [[imaginary number|imaginary]] values of $g$, which would however correspond to unstable [[interactions]] for which no converging field theory is to be expected. (See [Helling, p. 4](perturbative+quantum+field+theory#Helling) for the example of [[phi^4 theory]].)

In physical practice one tries to interpret these non-converging [[formal power series]] as _[[asymptotic expansions]]_ of
actual but hypothetical functions in $\hbar, g$, which reflect the actual but hypothetical _[[non-perturbative quantum field theory]]_
that one imagines is being approximated by [[perturbative QFT]] methods. An _[[asymptotic expansion]]_ of a function is a [[power series]] which may no converge, but which has for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ an estimate for how far the [[sum]] of the first $n$ terms in the series may differ from the function being approximated.

For examples such as [[quantum electrodynamics]] and [[quantum chromodynamics]], as in the [[standard model of particle physics]], the truncation of these [[formal power series]] [[scattering amplitudes]] to the first handful of [[loop orders]] in $\hbar$ happens to agree with [[experiment]] (such as at the [[LHC]] collider) to high precision (for [[QED]]) or at least decent precision (for [[QCD]]), at least away from infrared phenomena (see remark \ref{AdiabaticLimit}).

In summary this says that [[perturbative QFT]] is an extremely _coarse_ and restrictive approximation to what should be genuine [[non-perturbative quantum field theory]], while at the same time it happens to match certain experimental observations to remarkable degree, albeit only if some ad-hoc truncation of the resulting power series is considered.

This is strong motivation for going beyond [[perturbative QFT]] to understand and construct genuine [[non-perturbative quantum field theory]]. Unfortunately, this is a wide-open problem, away from toy examples. Not a single [[interacting field theory]] in [[spacetime]] [[dimension]] $\geq 4$ has been non-perturbatively quantized. Already a single aspect of the [[non-perturbative quantum field theory|non-perturbative]] [[quantization of Yang-Mills theory]] (as in [[QCD]]) has famously been advertized as one of the _[Millenium Problems](http://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems/yang%E2%80%93mills-and-mass-gap)_ of our age; and speculation about [[non-perturbative quantum field theory|non-perturbative]] [[quantum gravity]] is the subject of much activity.

Now, as the name indicates, the [[axioms]] of _[[causal perturbation theory]]_ (def. \ref{LagrangianFieldTheoryPerturbativeScattering}) do
_not_ address [[non-perturbative effect|non-perturbative aspects]] of [[non-perturbative field theory]]; the convergence or non-convergence of the [[formal power series]] that are axiomatized by [[Bogoliubov's formula]] (def. \ref{InteractingFieldObservables}) is _not_ addressed by the theory.
The point of the axioms of [[causal perturbation theory]] is to give rigorous mathematical meaning to _everything else_ in [[perturbative QFT]].

+-- {: .num_remark #DysonCausalFactorization}
###### Remark
**([[Dyson series]] and [[Schrödinger equation]] in [[interaction picture]])**

The axiom "[[causal additivity]]" (eq:CausalAdditivity) on an [[S-matrix]] scheme (def. \ref{LagrangianFieldTheoryPerturbativeScattering})
implies immediately this weaker condition:

* ([[causal factorization]])

  For all [[local observables]] $O_1, O_2 \in LocObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})[ [\hbar, h, j] ]\langle g , j\rangle $ we have

  $$
    \left(
       {\, \atop \,}
       supp(O_1) {\vee\!\!\!\wedge} supp(O_2)
       {\, \atop \,}
    \right)
    \;\; \Rightarrow \;\;
    \left(
      {\, \atop \,}
      \mathcal{S}( O_1 + O_2 )
      =
      \mathcal{S}( O_1 ) \, \mathcal{S}( O_2 )
      {\, \atop \,}
   \right)
  $$

(This is the special case of "causal additivity" for $O_0 = 0$, using that  by the axiom "perturbation" (eq:ExponentialSeriesScatteringMatrix) we have $\mathcal{S}(0) = 1$.)

If we now think of $O_1 = g S_{1}$ and $O_2 = g S_2$ themselves as [[adiabatic switching|adiabatically switched]] [[interaction]] [[action functionals]], then this becomes

  $$
    \left(
       {\, \atop \,}
       supp(S_1) {\vee\!\!\!\wedge} supp(S_2)
       {\, \atop \,}
    \right)
    \;\; \Rightarrow \;\;
    \left(
      {\, \atop \,}
      \mathcal{S}( g S_1 + g S_2 )
      =
      \mathcal{S}( g S_1) \, \mathcal{S}( g sS_2)
      {\, \atop \,}
   \right)
  $$

This exhibits the [[S-matrix]]-scheme as a "[[causal ordering|causally ordered]] [[exponential]]"
or "[[Dyson series]]" of the [[interaction]], hence as a refinement to [[relativistic field theory]] of what in
[[quantum mechanics]] is the "integral version of the [[Schrödinger equation]] in the [[interaction picture]]" (eq:IntegralVersionSchroedingerEquationInInteractionPicture). (See also [Scharf 95, second half of 0.3](#Scharf95)).

While [[causal additivity]] is in fact stronger than [[causal factorization]], we find below that the
evident analogue of [[causal factorization]] imposed directly on the [[time-ordered products]] (def. \ref{TimeOrderedProduct} below)
does _imply_ [[causal additivity]] of the [[S-matrix]] (prop. \ref{TimeOrderedProductInducesPerturbativeSMatrix} below).

The relevance of [[causal additivity]] of the [[S-matrix]], over just [[causal factorization]], is that it implies that
the induced [[interacting field algebra of observables]] (def. \ref{InteractingFieldObservables}) forms a [[causally local net]] (prop. \ref{PerturbativeQuantumObservablesIsLocalnet} below).

###### Remark
**([[path integral]]-intuition)**

In informal discussion of [[perturbative QFT]] going back to informal ideas of [[Schwinger-Tomonaga-Feynman-Dyson]], the
perturbative [[S-matrix]] is thought of in terms of a would-be _[[path integral]]_, symbolically written

$$
  \mathcal{S}\left(
    g S_{int} + j A
  \right)
  \;\overset{\text{not really!}}{=}\;
  \!\!\!\!\!
  \underset{\Phi \in \Gamma_\Sigma(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})_{asm}}{\int}
  \!\!\!\!\!\!
  \exp\left(
    \tfrac{1}{i \hbar}
    \int_\Sigma
    \left(
      g L_{int}(\Phi) + j A(\Phi)
    \right)
  \right)
  \,
  \exp\left(
    \tfrac{1}{i \hbar}\int_\Sigma L_{free}(\Phi)
  \right) D[\Phi]
  \,.
$$

Here the would-be [[integration]] is thought to be over the [[space of field histories]] $\Gamma_\Sigma(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})_{asm}$ (the [[space of sections]] of the given [[field bundle]]) for [[field histories]] which satisfy given asymptotic conditions at $x^0 \to \pm \infty$; and as these boundary conditions vary the above is regarded as a would-be [[integral kernel]] that defines the required operator in the [[Wick algebra]] (e.g. [Weinberg 95, around (9.3.10) and (9.4.1)](#Weinberg95)). This is related to the intuitive picture of the [[Feynman perturbation series]] expressing a sum over all possible interactions of [[virtual particles]] (remark \ref{WorldlineFormalism}).

Beyond toy examples, it is not known how to define the would-be [[measure]] $D[\Phi]$ and it is not known how to make sense of this expression as an actual [[integral]].

The analogous path-integral intuition for [[Bogoliubov's formula]] for [[interacting field observables]] (def. \ref{InteractingFieldObservables}) symbolically reads

$$
  \begin{aligned}
  A_{int}
  & \overset{\text{not really!}}{=}
  \frac{d}{d j}
  \ln
  \left(
  \underset{\Phi \in \Gamma_\Sigma(E)_{asm}}{\int}
  \!\!\!\!
  \exp\left(
    \underset{\Sigma}{\int}
      g L_{int}(\Phi) + j A(\Phi)
  \right)
  \,
  \exp\left( \underset{\Sigma}{\int} L_{free}(\Phi) \right)
  D[\Phi]
  \right)
  \vert_{j = 0}
  \end{aligned}
$$

If here we were to regard the expression

$$
  \mu(\Phi)
  \;\overset{\text{not really!}}{\coloneqq}\;
  \frac{
    \exp\left( \underset{\Sigma}{\int} L_{free}(\Phi) \right)\, D[\Phi]
  }
  {
    \underset{\Phi \in \Gamma_\Sigma(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})_{asm}}{\int}
    \!\!\!\!
    \exp\left( \underset{\Sigma}{\int} L_{free}(\Phi) \right)\, D[\Phi]
  }
$$

as a would-be [[Gaussian measure]] on the [[space of field histories]], normalized to a would-be [[probability measure]], then this formula
would express interacting field observables as ordinary [[expectation values]]

$$
  A_{int}
   \overset{\text{not really!}}{=}
   \!\!\!
  \underset{\Phi \in \Gamma_\Sigma(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})_{asm}}{\int}
  \!\!\!\!\!\!
     A(\Phi)
  \,\mu(\Phi)
  \,.
$$

As before, beyond toy examples it is not known how to make sense of this as an actual [[integration]].

But we may think of the axioms for the [[S-matrix]] in [[causal perturbation theory]] (def. \ref{LagrangianFieldTheoryPerturbativeScattering}) as rigorously _defining_ the [[path integral]], not analytically as an actual [[integration]], but _[[synthetic mathematics|synthetically]]_ by axiomatizing the properties of the desired _outcome_ of the would-be integration:

The analogy with a well-defined [[integral]] and the usual properties of an [[exponential]] vividly _suggest_
that the would-be [[path integral]] should obey [[causal factorization]]. Instead of trying to make sense of
[[path integral|path integration]] so that this factorization property could then be appealed to as a _consequence_ of general properties
of [[integration]] and [[exponentials]], the axioms of [[causal perturbation theory]] directly prescribe the
desired factorization property, without insisting that it derives from an actual integration.

The great success of [[path integral]]-intuition in the development of [[quantum field theory]], despite the dearth of
actual constructions, indicates that it is not the would-be integration process as such that actually matters in field
theory, but only the resulting properties that this _suggests_ the S-matrix should have; which is what
[[causal perturbation theory]] axiomatizes. Indeed, the simple [[axioms]] of [[causal perturbation theory]]
rigorously _imply_ finite (i.e. [[renormalization|("re"-)normalized]]) [[perturbative quantum field theory]] (see remark \ref{CausalPerturbationTheoryAbsenceOfUVDivergences}).

###### Remark
**([[adiabatic limit]], [[infrared divergences]] and [[interacting vacuum]])**

Since a [[local observable]] $S_{int} \in LocObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})[ [\hbar, g, j] ]$  by definition
has compact spacetime support, the [[scattering amplitudes]] in remark \ref{FromAxiomaticSMatrixScatteringAmplitudes}
describe [[scattering]] processes for [[interactions]] that vanish (are "[[adiabatic switching|adiabatically switched off]]") outside a compact subset of [[spacetime]]. This constraint is crucial for [[causal perturbation theory]] to work.

There are several aspects to this:

* ([[adiabatic limit]]) On the one hand, real physical interactions $\mathbf{L}_{int}$ (say the [[electron-photon interaction]])
are not _really_ supposed to vanish outside a compact region of spacetime. In order to reflect this mathematically, one may consider a [[sequence]] of [[adiabatic switchings]] $g_{sw} \in C^\infty_{cp}(\Sigma)\langle g \rangle$ (each of [[compact support]]) whose [[limit of a sequence|limit]] is the [[constant function]] $g \in C^\infty(\Sigma)\langle g\rangle$ (the actual [[coupling constant]]), then consider the corresponding [[sequence]] of [[interaction]] [[action functionals]] $S_{int,sw} \coloneqq \tau_\Sigma( g_{sw} \mathbf{L}_{int} )$ and finally consider:


   1. as the true [[scattering amplitude]] the corresponding [[limit of a sequence|limit]]

      $$
        \left\langle
          A_{out} \vert \mathcal{S}(S_{int}) \vert A_{int}
        \right\rangle
        \;\coloneqq\;
        \underset{g_{sw} \to 1}{\lim}
        \left\langle
          A_{out} \vert \mathcal{S}(S_{int,sw}) \vert A_{int}
        \right\rangle
      $$

      of adiabatically switched [[scattering amplitudes]] (remark \ref{FromAxiomaticSMatrixScatteringAmplitudes}) --  if it exists. This is called the _[[strong adiabatic limit]]_.

  1. as the true [[n-point functions]] the corresponding [[limit of a sequence|limit]]

     $$
       \begin{aligned}
       &
       \left\langle
         \mathbf{\Phi}^{a_1}_{int}(x_1)
         \mathbf{\Phi}^{a_2}_{int}(x_2)
           \cdots
         \mathbf{\Phi}^{a_{n-1}}_{int}(x_{n-1})
         \mathbf{\Phi}^{a_n}_{int,sw}(x_n)
       \right\rangle
       \\
       & =
       \underset{\underset{g_{sw} \to 1}{\longrightarrow}}{\lim}
       \left\langle
         \mathbf{\Phi}^{a_1}_{int,sw}(x_1)
         \mathbf{\Phi}^{a_2}_{int,sw}(x_2)
           \cdots
         \mathbf{\Phi}^{a_{n-1}}_{int,sw}(x_{n-1})
         \mathbf{\Phi}^{a_n}_{int,sw}(x_n)
       \right\rangle
       \end{aligned}
     $$

     of [[tempered distribution|tempered distributional]] [[expectation values]] of products of [[interacting field algebra|interacting]] [[field observables]] (def. \ref{InteractingFieldObservables}) -- if it exists. (Similarly for [[time-ordered products]].)  This is called the _[[weak adiabatic limit]]_.

  Beware that the left hand sides here are symbolic: Even if the limit exists in [[expectation values]], in general there is no actual observable whose expectation value is that limit.

  The strong and weak adiabatic limits have been shown to exist if all [[field (physics)|fields]] are [[mass|massive]] ([Epstein-Glaser 73](#EpsteinGlaser73)). The weak adiabatic limit has been shown to exists for [[quantum electrodynamics]] and for [[mass]]-less [[phi^4 theory]] ([Blanchard-Seneor 75](adiabatic+switching#BlanchardSeneor75)) and for larger classes of field theories in ([Duch 17, p. 113, 114](adiabatic+switching#Duch17)).

  If these limits do not exist, one says that the [[perturbative QFT]] has an _[[infrared divergence]]_.

* ([[algebraic adiabatic limit]]) On the other hand, it is equally unrealistic that an actual [[experiment]] _detects_ phenomena outside a given compact subset of spacetime. Realistic scattering [[experiments]] (such as the [[LHC]]) do not really prepare or measure [[plane waves]] filling all of [[spacetime]] as described by the [[scattering amplitudes]] (eq:ScatteringPlaneWaves). Any [[observable]] that is realistically measurable must have compact spacetime support. We see below in prop. \ref{IsomorphismFromChangeOfAdiabaticSwitching} that such [[interacting field observables]] with compact spacetime support may be computed without taking the [[adiabatic limit]]: It is sufficient to use any [[adiabatic switching]] which is constant on the support of the observable.

  This way one obtains for each [[causally closed subset]] $\mathcal{O}$ of spacetime an  algebra of observables $\mathcal{A}_{int}(\mathcal{O})$ whose support is in $\mathcal{O}$, and for each inclusion of subsets a corresponding inclusion of algebras of observables (prop. \ref{PerturbativeQuantumObservablesIsLocalnet} below). Of this system of observables one may form the [[category theory|category-theoretic]] [[inductive limit]] to obtain a single global algebra of observables.

  $$
    \mathcal{A}_{int}
      \;\coloneqq\;
    \underset{\underset{\mathcal{O}}{\longrightarrow}}{\lim}
      \mathcal{A}_{int}(\mathcal{O})
  $$

  This always exists. It is called the _[[algebraic adiabatic limit]]_ (going back to [Brunetti-Fredenhagen 00, section 8](perturbative+algebraic+quantum+field+theory#BrunettiFredenhagen00)).

  For [[quantum electrodynamics]] the [[algebraic adiabatic limit]] was worked out in ([Dütsch-Fredenhagen 98](quantum+electrodynamics#DuetschFredenhagen98), reviewed in [Dütsch 18, 5,3](QED+Duetsch18)).

* ([[interacting vacuum]]) While, via the above [[algebraic adiabatic limit]], [[causal perturbation theory]] yields the correct [[interacting field algebra of quantum observables]] independent of choices of [[adiabatic switching]], a theory of _[[quantum probability]]_ requires, on top of the [[algebra of observables]], also a _[[state on a star-algebra|state]]_

  $$
    \langle - \rangle_{int} \;\colon\; \mathcal{A}_{int} \longrightarrow \mathbb{C}[ [\hbar] ]
  $$

  Just as the [[interacting field algebra of observables]] $\mathcal{A}_{int}$ is a [[deformation]] of the free field algebra of observables ([[Wick algebra]]), there ought to be a corresponding deformation of the free [[Hadamard vacuum state]] $\langle- \rangle$ into an "[[interacting vacuum state]]" $\langle - \rangle_{int}$.

  Sometimes the [[weak adiabatic limit]] serves to define the [[interacting vacuum]] (see [Duch 17, p. 113-114](adiabatic+switching#Duch17)).

A stark example of these infrared issues is the phenomenon of _[[confinement]]_ of [[quarks]] to [[hadron]] [[bound states]] (notably to [[protons]] and [[neutrons]]) at large [[wavelengths]]. This is paramount in [[experiment|observation]] and reproduced in numerical [[lattice gauge theory]] simulation, but is invisible to [[perturbative QFT|perturbative]] [[quantum chromodynamics]] in its [[free field]] [[vacuum state]], due to [[infrared divergences]].
It is expected that this should be rectified by the proper [[interacting vacuum]] of [[QCD]] ([Rafelski 90, pages 12-16](confinement#Rafelski90)), which is possibly a "[[theta-vacuum]]" exhibiting [[superposition]] of [[instanton in QCD|QCD instantons]] ([Schäfer-Shuryak 98, section III.D](instanton+in+QCD#SchaeferShuryak98)). This remains open, closely related to the _[Millenium Problem](http://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems/yang%E2%80%93mills-and-mass-gap)_ of [[quantization of Yang-Mills theory]].

=--

In contrast to the above subtleties about the [[infrared divergences]], any would-be [[UV-divergences]] in [[perturbative QFT]] are
dealt with by [[causal perturbation theory]]:


+-- {: .num_remark #TheTraditionalErrorThatLeadsToTheNotoriouDivergencies}
###### Remark
**(the traditional error leading to [[UV-divergences]])**

Naively it might seem that (say over [[Minkowski spacetime]], for simplicity)
examples of [[time-ordered products]] according to def. \ref{TimeOrderedProduct}
might simply be obtained by multiplying [[Wick algebra]]-products with [[step functions]] $\Theta$ of the time coordinates, hence to write, in the notation as [[generalized functions]] (remark \ref{NotationForTimeOrderedProductsAsGeneralizedFunctions}):

$$
  T(x_1, x_2)
  \overset{\text{no!}}{=}
  \Theta(x_1^0 - x_2^0) \, T(x_1) \, T(x_2)
  +
  \Theta(x_2^0 - x_1^0) \, T(x_2) \, T(x_1)
$$

and analogously for time-ordered products of more arguments (for instance [Weinberg 95, p. 143, between (3.5.9) and (3.5.10)](#Weinberg95)).

This however is simply a mathematical error (as amplified in [Scharf 95, below (3.2.4), below (3.2.44) and in fig. 3](causal+perturbation+theory#Scharf95)):

Both $T$ as well as $\Theta$ are [[distributions]] and their [[product of distributions]] is in general not defined ([[Hörmander's criterion]] may be violated). The notorious [[ultraviolet divergences]] which plagued ([Feynman 85](Schwinger-Tomonaga-Feynman-Dyson#Feynman85SuchABunchOfWords)) the original conception of [[perturbative QFT]] due to [[Schwinger-Tomonaga-Feynman-Dyson]] are the signature of this ill-defined product (see remark \ref{CausalPerturbationTheoryAbsenceOfUVDivergences}).

On the other hand, when both distributions are [[restriction of distributions|restricted]] to the [[complement]] of the [[diagonal]]
(i.e. restricted away from coinciding points $x_1 = x_2$), then the [[step function]] becomes a [[non-singular distribution]]
so that the above expression happens to be well defined and does solve the axioms for time-ordered products.

Hence what needs to be done to properly define the [[time-ordered product]] is to choose an [[extension of distributions]] of the above product expression back from the complement of the diagonal to the whole space of [[tuples]] of points. Any such extension will produce time-ordered products.

There are in general several different such [[extension of distributions|extensions]]. This freedom of choice is the freedom
of _[[renormalization|"re-"normalization]]_; or equivalently, by the [[main theorem of perturbative renormalization theory]] (theorem \ref{PerturbativeRenormalizationMainTheorem}),
this is the freedom of choosing "counter terms" for the [[local observable|local]] [[interactions]]. This we discuss below in
_[Feynman diagrams and (re-)normalization](#ExistenceAndRenormalization)_.

+-- {: .num_remark #CausalPerturbationTheoryAbsenceOfUVDivergences}
###### Remark
**(absence of [[ultraviolet divergences]] and [[renormalization|re-normalization]])**

The simple axioms of [[causal perturbation theory]] (def. \ref{LagrangianFieldTheoryPerturbativeScattering})
do fully capture [[perturbative quantum field theory]] "in the ultraviolet": A solution to these axioms
induces, by definition, well-defined [[perturbative QFT|perturbative]] [[scattering amplitudes]] (remark \ref{FromAxiomaticSMatrixScatteringAmplitudes})
and well-defined [[perturbative QFT|perturbative]] [[probability amplitudes]] of [[interacting field observables]] (def. \ref{InteractingFieldObservables}) induced by _[[local observables|local]]_ [[action functionals]] (describing point-interactions such as the [[electron-photon interaction]]). By the [[main theorem of perturbative renormalization]] (theorem \ref{PerturbativeRenormalizationMainTheorem}) such solutions exist. This means that, while these are necessarily [[formal power series]] in $\hbar$ and $g$ (remark \ref{AsymptoticSeriesObservables}), all the [[coefficients]] of these formal power series ("[[loop order]] contributions") are well defined.

This is in contrast to the original informal conception of [[perturbative QFT]] due to [[Schwinger-Tomonaga-Feynman-Dyson]],
which in a first stage produced ill-defined [[divergence|diverging]] expressions for the [[coefficients]] (due to the mathematical error discussed in remark \ref{TheTraditionalErrorThatLeadsToTheNotoriouDivergencies} below), which were then "[[renormalization|re-normalized]]" to finite values, by further informal arguments.

Here in [[causal perturbation theory]] no [[divergences]] in the [[coefficients]] of the [[formal power series]] are considered in the first place, all coefficients are well-defined, hence "finite". In this sense [[causal perturbation theory]] is about "finite" perturbative QFT, where instead of "re-normalization" of ill-defined expressions one just encounters "normalization" (prominently highlighted in [Scharf 95, see title, introduction, and section 4.3](causal+perturbation+theoryscatt#Scharf95)), namely compatible choices of these finite values, parameterized by the [[Stückelberg-Petermann renormalization group]].

This refers to those [[divergences]] that are known as _[[UV-divergences]]_, namely short-distance effects,
which are mathematically reflected in the fact that the perturbative [[S-matrix]] scheme (def. \ref{LagrangianFieldTheoryPerturbativeScattering})
is defined on _[[local observables]]_, which, by their very locality, encode point-[[interactions]].
See also remark \ref{AdiabaticLimit} on _[[infrared divergences]]_.

###### Remark
**([[virtual particles]], [[worldline formalism]] and [[perturbative string theory]])**

It is suggestive to think of the [[edges]] in the [[Feynman diagrams]] (def. \ref{FeynmanDiagram}) as [[worldlines]] of "[[virtual particles]]" and of the [[vertices]] as the points where they collide and transmute. (Care must be exercised not to confuse this with concepts of real [[particles]].) With this interpretation prop. \ref{FeynmanDiagramAmplitude} may be read as saying that the [[scattering amplitude]] for given external [[source fields]] (remark \ref{FromAxiomaticSMatrixScatteringAmplitudes}) is the [[superposition]] of the [[Feynman amplitudes]] of all possible ways that these may interact; which is closely related to the intuition for the [[path integral]] (remark \ref{InterpretationOfPerturbativeSMatrix}).

This intuition is made precise by the _[[worldline formalism]]_ of [[perturbative quantum field theory]] ([Strassler 92](worldline+formalism#Strassler92)). This is the perspective on [[perturbative QFT]] which directly relates [[perturbative QFT]] to [[perturbative string theory]] ([Schmidt-Schubert 94](worldline+formalism#SchmidtSchubert94)). In fact the [[worldline formalism]] for [[perturbative QFT]] was originally found by taking thre point-particle limit of [[string scattering amplitudes]] ([Bern-Kosower 91](worldline+formalism#BernKosower91), [Bern-Kosower 92](worldline+formalism#BernKosower92)).

for a fixed ([[adiabatic switching|adiabatically switched]] [[local observable|local]]) [[interaction]] $S_{int}$, reflecting the [[scattering amplitudes]] (remark \ref{FromAxiomaticSMatrixScatteringAmplitudes}) with respect to that particular interaction.  Hence the function

axiomatized in def. \ref{LagrangianFieldTheoryPerturbativeScattering} is really a whole _scheme_ for constructing compatible S-matrices for _all_ possible (adiabatically switched, local) interactions at once.

Since the usual proof of the construction of such schemes of S-matrices involves _[[renormalization|("re"-)normalization]]_, the function $\mathcal{S}$ axiomatized by def. \ref{LagrangianFieldTheoryPerturbativeScattering} may also be referred to as a _[[renormalization scheme|("re"-)normalization scheme]]_.

This perspective on $\mathcal{S}$ as a [[renormalization scheme]] is amplified by the [[main theorem of perturbative renormalization]] (theorem \ref{PerturbativeRenormalizationMainTheorem})
wich states that the space of choices for $\mathcal{S}$ is a [[torsor]] over the [[Stückelberg-Petermann renormalization group]].

**([[quantum anomalies]])**

The [[axioms]] for the [[S-matrix]] in def. \ref{LagrangianFieldTheoryPerturbativeScattering}
(and similarly that for the [[time-ordered products]] below in def. \ref{TimeOrderedProduct})
are sufficient to imply a [[causally local net]] of perturbative [[interacting field algebras of quantum observables]] (prop. \ref{PerturbativeQuantumObservablesIsLocalnet} below), and thus its [[algebraic adiabatic limit]] (remark \ref{AdiabaticLimit}).

It does not guarantee, however, that the [[BV-BRST differential]] passes to those
[[algebras of quantum observables]], hence it does not guarantee that the [[infinitesimal symmetries of the Lagrangian]]
are respected by the [[quantization]] process (there may be "[[quantum anomalies]]").
The extra condition that does ensure this is the _[[quantum master Ward identity]]_ or _[[quantum master equation]]_.
This we discuss elsewhere.

Apart from [[gauge symmetries]] one also wants to require that rigid symmetries  are preserved by the S-matrix, notably [[Poincare group]]-symmetry for scattering on [[Minkowski spacetime]]. This extra axiom is needed to imply the _[[main theorem of perturbative renormalization]]_ (theorem \ref{PerturbativeRenormalizationMainTheorem}).

#### Interacting field observables
 {#QuantumObservables}

We have seen that via [[Bogoliubov's formula]] (def. \ref{InteractingFieldObservables}) every perturbative [[S-matrix]] scheme (def. \ref{LagrangianFieldTheoryPerturbativeScattering}) induces for every choice of [[adiabatic switching|adiabatically switched]]
[[interaction]] [[action functional]] $S_{int,sw} \coloneqq \tau_\Sigma( g_{sw} \mathbf{L}_{int} )$ a notion of [[perturbative QFT|perturbative]] [[interacting field observables]] (def. \ref{InteractingFieldObservables}). These generate an algebra (def. \ref{QuntumMollerOperator} below).
By [[Bogoliubov's formula]], in general this algebra depends on the choice of [[adiabatic switching]];
which however is not meant to be part of the [[physics]], but just a mathematical device for grasping global field structures locally.

But this spurious dependence  goes away (prop. \ref{IsomorphismFromChangeOfAdiabaticSwitching} below) when restricting attention to
observables whose spacetime support is inside a compact [[causally closed subsets]] $\mathcal{O}$ of spacetime (def. \ref{PerturbativeGeneratingLocalNetOfObservables} below). This is a sensible condition for an [[observable]] in [[physics]],
where any realistic [[experiment]] nessecarily probes only a compact subset of spacetime, see also remark \ref{AdiabaticLimit}.

The resulting system (a "[[co-presheaf]]") of well-defined perturbative [[interacting field algebras of observables]] (def. \ref{SystemOfAlgebrasOfQuantumObservables} below)

$$
  \mathcal{O} \mapsto IntObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}}, \mathbf{L}_{int})(\mathcal{O})
$$

is in fact [[causal locality|causally local]] (prop. \ref{PerturbativeQuantumObservablesIsLocalnet} below).
This fact was presupposed without proof already in [Il'in-Slavnov 78](perturbative+algebraic+quantum+field+theory#IlinSlavnov78);
because this is one of two key properties that the [[Haag-Kastler axioms]] ([Haag-Kastler 64](Haag-Kastler+axioms#HaagKastler64)) demand of an intrinsically defined [[quantum field theory]]
(i.e. defined without necessarily making recourse to the geometric backdrop of [[Lagrangian field theory]]). The only other key property demanded by the [[Haag-Kastler axioms]]
is that the [[algebras of observables]] be [[C*-algebras]]; this however must be regarded as the axiom encoding
[[non-perturbative quantum field theory]] and hence is necessarily violated in the present context of [[perturbative QFT]].

Since quantum field theory following the full [[Haag-Kastler axioms]] is commonly known as _[[AQFT]]_, this perturbative version,
with [[causally local nets of observables]] but without the [[C*-algebra]]-condition on them, has come to be called
_[[perturbative AQFT]]_ ([Dütsch-Fredenhagen 01](perturbative+algebraic+quantum+field+theory#DuetschFredenhagen01),
[Fredenhagen-Rejzner 12](perturbative+algebraic+quantum+field+theory#FredenhagenRejzner12)).

In this terminology the content of prop. \ref{PerturbativeQuantumObservablesIsLocalnet} below is that
_while the input of [[causal perturbation theory]] is a [[gauge fixing|gauge fixed]] [[Lagrangian field theory]],
the output is a [[perturbative algebraic quantum field theory]]_:

$$


The independence of the [[causally local net]] of localized [[interacting field algebras of observables]]
$IntObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}}, \mathbf{L}_{int} )(\mathcal{O})$ from the choice of [[adiabatic switching]]
implies a well-defined spacetime-global [[algebra of observables]] by forming the [[inductive limit]]

$$
  IntObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}}, \mathbf{L}_{int})
    \;\coloneqq\;
  \underset{\underset{\mathcal{O}}{\longrightarrow}}{\lim}

  \right)
  \,.
$$

This is also called the _[[algebraic adiabatic limit]]_, defining the [[algebras of observables]] of [[perturbative QFT]]
"in the infrared". The only remaining step in the construction of a [[perturbative QFT]] that remains is then
to find an [[interacting vacuum state]]

$$

This is related to the actual _[[adiabatic limit]]_, and it is by and large an open problem, see remark \ref{AdiabaticLimit}.

###### Proposition
**(localized [[interacting field observables]] independent of [[adiabatic switching]])**

Let $(E_{\text{BV-BRST}}, \mathbf{L}', \Delta_H )$ be a [[relativistic field theory|relativistic]] [[free field theory|free]] [[vacuum]] according to def. \ref{VacuumFree}, let $\mathcal{S}$ be a corresponding [[S-matrix]] scheme according to def. \ref{LagrangianFieldTheoryPerturbativeScattering}, and let

$$
  g S_{int,sw} \;\coloneqq\; \tau_\Sigma(g_{sw} \mathbf{L}_{int})
  \;\in\;
  LocObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})[ [ \hbar, g, j] ]
$$

is a [[local observable]], to be thought of as an [[adiabatic switching|adiabatically switched]] [[interaction]] [[action functional]].

If two such [[adiabatic switchings]] $g_{sw,1}, g_{sw,2} \in C^\infty_{cp}(\Sigma)$ agree on a
[[causally closed subset]]

$$
  \mathcal{O} \;\subset\; \Sigma
$$

in that

$$
  g_{sw,1}\vert_{\mathcal{O}} = g_{sw,2}\vert_{\mathcal{O}}
$$

then there exists a [[microcausal polynomial observable]]

$$
  K \;\in\; PolyObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})_{mc}[ [ \hbar, g, j ] ]
$$

such that for every [[local observable]]

$$
  A \;\in\; LocObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})[ [ \hbar, g ] ]
$$

with spacetime support in $\mathcal{O}$

$$
  supp(A) \;\subset\; \mathcal{O}
$$

the corresponding two [[generating functions]] (eq:GeneratingFunctionInducedFromSMatrix)
are related via [[conjugation]] by $K$:

$$
  \label{AdiabaticSwitchingRelationGeneratingFunctions}
  \mathcal{Z}_{S_{int,sw_2}}
  \left(
    j A
  \right)
  \;=\;
  K^{-1}

$$

In particular this means that for every choice of [[adiabatic switching]] $g_{sw} \in Cutoffs(\mathcal{O})$
the algebra $Gen_{S_{int,sw}}(\mathcal{O})$ of [[generating functions]] for [[interacting field observables]]
computed with $g_{sw}$ is canonically [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the
abstract algebra $Gen_{\mathbf{L}_{int}}(\mathcal{O})$  (def. \ref{PerturbativeGeneratingLocalNetOfObservables}),
by the evident map on generators:

    \right)_{g_{sw'} \in Cutoffs(\mathcal{O})}

###### Proof

By causal closure of $\mathcal{O}$, [this lemma](A+first+idea+of+quantum+field+theory#CausalPartition)
says that there are [[bump functions]]

$$
  a, r \in C^\infty_{cp}(\Sigma)\langle g \rangle
$$

which decompose the difference of [[adiabatic switchings]]

$$
  g_{sw,2} - g_{sw,1} = a + r
$$

subject to the [[causal ordering]]

$$
  supp(a) \,{\vee\!\!\!\wedge}\, \mathcal{O} \,{\vee\!\!\!\wedge}\, supp(r)

This proves the existence of elements $K$ as claimed.

It is clear that conjugation induces an algebra homomorphism,
and since the map is a linear isomorphism on the space of generators,
it is an algebra isomorphism on the algebras being generated (eq:AbstractGeneratingFunctionAlgebraIsomorphicToAnyAdiabaticSwitching).

(While the elements $K$ in (eq:AdiabaticSwitchingRelationGeneratingFunctions) are far from being unique themselves,
equation (eq:AdiabaticSwitchingRelationGeneratingFunctions) says that the map on generators induced
by conjugation with $K$ is independent of this choice.)

###### Remark
**([[time-ordered products]] as [[generalized functions]])**

It is convenient (as in [Epstein-Glaser 73](#EpsteinGlaser73)) to think of [[time-ordered products]] (def. \ref{TimeOrderedProduct}), being
[[Wick algebra]]-valued [[distributions]] (hence [[operator-valued distributions]] if we were to choose a [[representation]] of the
[[Wick algebra]] by [[linear operators]] on a [[Hilbert space]]), as [[generalized functions]] depending on spacetime points:

If

$$
  \left\{
    \alpha_ \in \Omega^{p+1,0}_\Sigma(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})\langle g \rangle
  \right\}
  \cup
  \left\{
    \beta_j \in \Omega^{p+1,0}_\Sigma(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})\langle j \rangle
  \right\}
$$

is a [[finite set]] of [[horizontal differential forms]], and

$$
  \left\{
    g_i, j_{j} \in C^\infty_{cp}(\Sigma)
  \right\}
$$

is a corresponding set of [[bump functions]] on [[spacetime]] ([[adiabatic switchings]]), so that

$$
  \left\{
    S_j
      \colon
    \Phi
      \mapsto
    \underset{\Sigma}{\int} g_i(x) \, \left(j^\infty_\Sigma(\Phi)^\ast \alpha_i\right)(x)\, dvol_\Sigma(x)
  \right\}
  \;\cup\;
  \left\{
    A_j
      \colon
    \Phi
      \mapsto
    \underset{\Sigma}{\int} j_i(x) \, \left(j^\infty_\Sigma(\Phi)^\ast \beta_i\right)(x)\, dvol_\Sigma(x)
  \right\}
$$

is the corresponding set of [[local observables]], then we may write the [[time-ordered product]]
of these observables as the [[integration]] of these [[bump functions]] against a [[generalized function]]
$T_{(\alpha_i)}$ with values in the [[Wick algebra]]:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    &
    \underset{\Sigma^n}{\int}
      T_{(\alpha_i), (\beta_j)}(x_1, \cdots, x_{r}, x_{r+1}, \cdots x_{n})
      g_1(x_1) \cdots g_r(x_r)
      \,
      j_1(x_{r+1}) \cdots j_n(x_n)
    \, dvol_{\Sigma^n}(x_1, \cdots x_n)
    \\
    & \coloneqq
      T( S_1, \cdots, S_r, A_{r+1}, \cdots, A_n )
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

Moreover, the subscripts on these [[generalized functions]] will always be
clear from the context, so that in computations we may notationally suppress these.

Finally, due to the "symmetry" axiom in def. \ref{TimeOrderedProduct}, a time-ordered product
depends, up to signs, only on its [[set]] of arguments, not on the order of the arguments. We will write
$\mathbf{X} \coloneqq \{x_1, \cdots, x_r\}$ and $\mathbf{Y} \coloneqq \{y_1, \cdots y_r\}$
for sets of spacetime points, and hence abbreviate the expression for the "value" of the
generalized function in the above as $T(\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{Y})$ etc.

In this condensed notation the above reads

$$
    \underset{\Sigma^{r+s}}{\int}
      T(\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{Y})
      \,
      g_1(x_1) \cdots g_r(x_r)
      j_{r+1}(x_{r+1}) \cdots j_n(x_n)
    \,
    dvol_{\Sigma^{r+s}}(\mathbf{X})
  \,.
$$

=--

This condensed notation turns out to be greatly simplify computations, as it absorbs all the "relative"
combinatorial prefactors:

and

$$

Then their product $W(g) \coloneqq U(g) V(g)$ with [[generalized function]]-representation

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

For fixed [[cardinality]] ${\vert \mathbf{I} \vert} = n_1$
the sum over all subsets $\mathbf{I} \subset \mathbf{X}$ overcounts the sum over
[[partitions]] of the coordinates as $(x_1, \cdots x_{n_1}, x_{n_1 + 1}, \cdots x_n)$ precisely by the
[[binomial coefficient]] $\frac{n!}{n_1! (n - n_1) !}$. Here the factor of $n!$ cancels
against the "global" combinatorial prefactor in the above expansion of $W(g)$, while the remaining
factor $\frac{1}{n_1! (n - n_1) !}$ is just the "relative" combinatorial prefactor seen at total order $n$
when expanding the product $U(g)V(g)$.

In order to prove that the axioms for [[time-ordered products]] do imply those for a perturbative [[S-matrix]]
(prop. \ref{TimeOrderedProductInducesPerturbativeSMatrix} below) we need to consider
the corresponding reverse-time ordered products:

$$

expresses the [[inverse]] $S(-)^{-1}$ (according to remark \ref{PerturbativeSMatrixInverse}) of the corresponding
perturbative [[S-matrix]] scheme $\mathcal{S}(S_{int}) \coloneqq \underset{k \in \mathbb{N}}{\sum} \tfrac{1}{k!} T(\underset{k\,\text{args}}{\underbrace{S_{int}, \cdots , S_{int}}})$ (def. \ref{LagrangianFieldTheoryPerturbativeScattering}):

    \right)^k

  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

For brevity we write just "$A$" for $\tfrac{1}{i \hbar}(g S_{int} + j A)$.
(Hence we assume without restriction that $A$ is not independent of
powers of $g$ and $j$; this is just for making all sums in the following be order-wise finite sums.)

By definition we have

$$
  \begin{aligned}
  &
  \underset{k \in \mathbb{N}}{\sum}
    \frac{1}{k!}
    \overline{T}( \underset{k \, \text{args}}{\underbrace{A,  \cdots , A}} )
  \\
  & =
  \underset{ k \in \mathbb{N}}{\sum}
    \frac{1}{k!}
    \underoverset{r = 1}{k}{\sum}
    (-1)^r
    \!\!\!\underset{\sigma \in Unshuffl(k,r)}{\sum}\!\!\!
    T( A_{\sigma(1)} \cdots A_{\sigma(k_1)} )
    T( A_{\sigma(k_1 + 1)} \cdots A_{\sigma(k_2)} )
    \cdots
    T( A_{\sigma(k_{r-1}+1)} \cdots A_{\sigma_{k_r}} )
  \end{aligned}
$$

where all the $A_k$ happen to coincide: $A_k = A$.

If instead of [[unshuffles]] (i.e. [[partitions]] into non-empty subsequences preserving the original order) we took
partitions into arbitrarily ordered subsequences,
we would be overcounting by the [[factorial]] of the length of the subsequences, and hence the
above may be equivalently written as:

$$
  \cdots
  =
  \underset{k \in \mathbb{N}}{\sum}
    \tfrac{1}{k!}
    \underoverset{r = 1}{k}{\sum}
    (-1)^r
    \!\!\!
    \underset{ {\sigma \in \Sigma(k)} \atop { { k_1 + \cdots + k_r = k } \atop { \underset{i}{\forall} (k_i \geq 1) } } }{\sum}
    \!\!\!
    \tfrac{1}{k_1!} \cdots \tfrac{1}{k_r !}
    \,
    T( A_{\sigma(1)} \cdots A_{\sigma(k_1)} )
    \,
    T( A_{\sigma(k_1 + 1)} \cdots A_{\sigma(k_2)} )
    \cdots
    T( A_{\sigma(k_{r-1}+1)} \cdots A_{\sigma_{k_r}} )
    \,,
$$

where $\Sigma(k)$ denotes the [[symmetric group]] (the set of all [[permutations]] of $k$ elements).

Moreover, since all the $A_k$ are equal, the sum is in fact independent of $\sigma$, it only depends
on the length of the subsequences. Since there are $k!$ permutations of $k$ elements
the above reduces to

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \cdots

    \underset{k \in \mathbb{N}}{\sum}

We proceed by [[induction]]. If ${\vert \mathbf{X}\vert} = 1$ the statement is immediate.
So assume that the statement is true for sets of [[cardinality]] $n \geq 1$ and consider
$\mathbf{X}$ with ${\vert \mathbf{X}\vert} = n+1$.

We make free use of the condensed notation as in example \ref{ProductOfPerturbationSeriesInGenealizedFunctionNotation}.

From the formal inversion

$$
  \underset{\mathbf{J} \subset \mathbf{X}}{\sum} \overline{T}(\mathbf{J}) T(\mathbf{X}\setminus \mathbf{J})
  = 0
$$

(which uses the induction assumption that ${\vert \mathbf{X}\vert} \geq 1$) it follows that

Here

1. in the second line we used that $\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{Q} \sqcup \mathbf{P}$, together with the
[[causal factorization]] property of $T(-)$ (which holds by def. \ref{TimeOrderedProduct}) and that of $\overline{T}(-)$
(which holds by the induction assumption, using that $\mathbf{J} \neq \mathbf{X}$ hence that
${\vert \mathbf{J}\vert} \lt {\vert \mathbf{X}\vert}$).

1. in the third line we decomposed the sum over $\mathbf{J}, \mathbf{J}' \subset \mathbf{X}$
into two sums over subsets of $\mathbf{Q}$ and $\mathbf{P}$:

   1. The first summand in the third line is the contribution where $\mathbf{J}'$ has a non-empty intersection with $\mathbf{Q}$. This makes $\mathbf{K}$ range without constraint, and therefore the sum in the middle vanishes, as indicated, as it is the contribution at order ${\vert \mathbf{Q}\vert}$ of the inversion formula from prop. \ref{InversionFormulaForTimeOrderedProducts}.

   1. The second summand in the third line is the contribution where $\mathbf{J}'$ does not intersect $\mathbf{Q}$.
     Now the sum over $\mathbf{K}$ is the inversion formula from prop. \ref{InversionFormulaForTimeOrderedProducts} except for one term, and so it equals that term.

Using these facts about the reverse-time ordered products,
we may finally prove that [[time-ordered products]] indeed do induced a perturbative S-matrix:

+-- {: .num_prop #TimeOrderedProductInducesPerturbativeSMatrix}
###### Proposition
**([[time-ordered products]] induce [[S-matrix]])**

Let $\{T_k\}_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a system of [[time-ordered products]] according to def. \ref{TimeOrderedProduct}.
Then

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \mathcal{S}(-)
    & \coloneqq
    T
    \left(
      \exp_\otimes
      \left(

    \coloneqq
    \underset{k \in \mathbb{N}}{\sum}
    \tfrac{1}{k!}
    \tfrac{1}{(i \hbar)^k}  T( \underset{k \, \text{factors}}{\underbrace{-,  \cdots , -}} )
  \end{aligned}
$$

is indeed a perturbative S-matrix according to def. \ref{LagrangianFieldTheoryPerturbativeScattering}.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The axiom "perturbation" of the S-matrix is
immediate from the axioms "perturbation" and "normalization" of the time-ordered products.
What requires proof is that [[causal additivity]] of the S-matrix follows from
the [[causal factorization]] property of the time-ordered products.

Notice that also the weaker [[causal factorization]] property of the S-matrix (remark \ref{DysonCausalFactorization})
is immediate from the causal factorization condition on the time-ordered products.

But [[causal additivity]] is stronger. It is remarkable that this, too,
follows from just the time-ordering ([Epstein-Glaser 73, around (73)](#EpsteinGlaser73)):

To see this, first expand the
generating function $\mathcal{Z}$ (eq:GeneratingFunctionInducedFromSMatrix)  into
powers of $g$ and $j$

$$
  \mathcal{Z}_{g S_{int}}(j A)
  \;=\;
  \underoverset{n,m = 0}{\infty}{\sum}
   \frac{1}{n! m!}
   R\left(
      {\, \atop \,}
      \underset{n\, \text{factors}}{\underbrace{g S_{int},  \cdots ,g S_{int}}},
      ( \underset{m \, \text{factors}}{ \underbrace{ j A ,  \cdots , j A } }  )
      {\, \atop \,}
   \right)
$$

and then compare order-by-order with the given time-ordered product $T$ and
its induced reverse-time ordered product (def. \ref{ReverseTimeOrderedProduct}) via prop. \ref{ReverseTimOrderedProductsGiveReverseSMatrix}.
(These $R(-,-)$ are also called the "generating [[retarded products]], discussed in their own right around def. \ref{RetardedProductFromPerturbativeSMatrix} below.)

In the condensed notation of
remark \ref{NotationForTimeOrderedProductsAsGeneralizedFunctions}
and its way of absorbing combinatorial prefactors as in example \ref{ProductOfPerturbationSeriesInGenealizedFunctionNotation}
this
yields at order $(g/\hbar)^{\vert \mathbf{Y}\vert} (j/\hbar)^{\vert \mathbf{X}\vert}$ the coefficient

$$
  \label{CoefficientOfgeneratingRetardedProduct}
  R(\mathbf{Y}, \mathbf{X})
   \;=\;
  \underset{\mathbf{I} \subset \mathbf{Y}}{\sum}
    \overline{T}(\mathbf{I})
    T( (\mathbf{Y} \setminus \mathbf{I}) , \mathbf{X} )
  \,.
$$

We claim now that the [[support of a distribution|support]] of $R$ is inside the subset for which
$\mathbf{Y}$ is in the [[causal past]] of $\mathbf{X}$. This will imply the claim, because by
multi-linearity of $R(-,-)$ it then follows that

$$
  \left(supp(A_1) {\vee\!\!\!\wedge} supp(A_2)\right)
  \Rightarrow
  \left( Z_{(g S_{int}  + j A_1)}(j A_2) = Z_{S_{int}}(A_2) \right)
$$

and by prop. \ref{ZCausalAdditivity} this is equivalent to [[causal additivity]] of the S-matrix.

It remains to prove the claim:

Consider $\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{Y} \subset \Sigma$ such that the subset $\mathbf{P} \subset \mathbf{Y}$
of points not in the past of $\mathbf{X}$, hence the maximal subset with [[causal ordering]]

$$
  \mathbf{P} {\vee\!\!\!\wedge} \mathbf{X}
  \,,
$$

is non-empty. We need to show that in this case $R(\mathbf{Y}, \mathbf{X}) = 0$ (in the sense of generalized functions).

Write $\mathbf{Q} \coloneqq \mathbf{Y} \setminus \mathbf{P}$
for the complementary set of points, so that all points of $\mathbf{Q}$ are in the past of $\mathbf{X}$.
Notice that this implies that $\mathbf{P}$ is also not in the past of $\mathbf{Q}$:

$$
  \mathbf{P} {\vee\!\!\!\wedge} \mathbf{Q}
  \,.
$$

With this decomposition of $\mathbf{Y}$, the sum in (eq:CoefficientOfgeneratingRetardedProduct)
over subsets $\mathbf{I}$ of $\mathbf{Y}$ may be decomposed into a sum over
subsets $\mathbf{J}$ of $\mathbf{P}$ and $\mathbf{K}$ of $\mathbf{Q}$, respectively.
These subsets inherit the above causal ordering, so that by the causal factorization property of
$T(-)$ (def. \ref{TimeOrderedProduct}) and $\overline{T}(-)$ (prop. \ref{ReverseCausalFactorizationOfReverseTimeOrderedProducts})
the time-ordered and reverse time-ordered products
factor on these arguments:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    R(\mathbf{Y}, \mathbf{X})
    & =
    \underset{ {\mathbf{J} \subset \mathbf{P}} \atop { \mathbf{K} \subset \mathbf{Q} } }{\sum}
     \,
     \overline{T}( \mathbf{J} \cup \mathbf{K} )
     T( (\mathbf{P} \setminus \mathbf{J}) \cup (\mathbf{Q} \setminus \mathbf{K}), \mathbf{X} )
     \\
     & =
     \underset{ {\mathbf{J} \subset \mathbf{P}} \atop { \mathbf{K} \subset \mathbf{Q} } }{\sum}
     \,
     \overline{T}( \mathbf{K} )
     \overline{T}( \mathbf{J} )
     T( \mathbf{P} \setminus \mathbf{J} )
     T( \mathbf{Q} \setminus \mathbf{K}, \mathbf{X} )
     \\
     & =
     \underset{ \mathbf{K} \subset \mathbf{Q} }{\sum}
     \overline{T}(\mathbf{K})
     \underset{= 0}{
     \underbrace{
     \left(
       \underset{\mathbf{J} \subset \mathbf{P}}{\sum}
       \overline{T}(\mathbf{J})
       T( \mathbf{P} \setminus \mathbf{J} )
     \right)
     }}
     T(\mathbf{Q} \setminus \mathbf{K}, \mathbf{X})
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

Here the sub-sum in brackets vanishes by the inversion formula, prop. \ref{InversionFormulaForTimeOrderedProducts}.

#### ("Re"-)Normalization
 {#ExistenceAndRenormalization}

We discuss now that [[time-ordered products]] as in def. \ref{TimeOrderedProduct}, hence, by prop. \ref{TimeOrderedProductInducesPerturbativeSMatrix}, perturbatibe [[S-matrix]] schemes (def. \ref{LagrangianFieldTheoryPerturbativeScattering}) exist in fact uniquely away from coinciding interaction points (prop. \ref{TimeOrderedProductAwayFromDiagonal} below). This means that the construction of full [[time-ordered products]]/[[S-matrix]] schemes may be phrased as an [[extension of distributions]] of unique time ordered products away from coinciding interaction points to these coinciding interaction points. This [[extension of distributions]] is called [[renormalization|("re"-)normalization]] (def. \ref{ExtensionOfTimeOrderedProoductsRenormalization} below).

**([[time-ordered product]] away from coinciding interaction points)**

Let $(E_{\text{BV-BRST}}, \mathbf{L}', \Delta_H )$ be a [[relativistic field theory|relativistic]] [[free field theory|free]] [[vacuum]] according to def. \ref{VacuumFree}, and let $T = \{T_k\}_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence of [[time-ordered products]] (def. \ref{TimeOrderedProduct})

$$

Then their [[restriction]] to the subspace of [[tuples]] of [[local observables]] of pairwise disjoint spacetime support (def. \ref{TuplesOfCompactlySupportedPolynomialLocalFunctionalsWithPairwiseDisjointSupport}) is unique (independent of the [[renormalization|"re-"normalization]] freedom in choosing $T$) and is given by the [[star product]]

that is induced ([this def.](star+product#PropagatorStarProduct)) by the [[Feynman propagator]] $\Delta_F \coloneqq \tfrac{i}{2}(\Delta_+ + \Delta_- + H)$ (corresponding to the [[Wightman propagator]] $\Delta_H = \tfrac{i}{2}(\Delta_+ - \Delta_-) + H$ which is given by the choice of [[free field|free]] [[vacuum]]), in that

$$

    \cdots
    \star_F
  A_k
  \,.

In particular the time-ordered product extends from the restricted domain of tensor products of local observables to a restricted domain of [[microcausal polynomial observables]], where it becomes an [[associativity|associative]] product:

$$
  \label{RestrictedTimeOrderedProductAssociative}
  \begin{aligned}

    T(A_{k_1 + 1}, \cdots, A_{k_2})
      \star_F
      \cdots
      \star_F
    T(A_{k_{n-1} + 1}, \cdots, A_{k_n})
    \\
    & =
    A_1 \star_F \cdots \star_F A_{k_n}
  \end{aligned}
$$

for all tuples of local observables $A_1, \cdots, A_{k_1}, A_{k_1+1}, \cdots, A_{k_2}, \cdots, \cdots A_{k_n}$ with pairwise disjoint spacetime support.

=--

The idea of this statement goes back at least to [Epstein-Glaser 73](#EpsteinGlaser73), as in remark \ref{TheTraditionalErrorThatLeadsToTheNotoriouDivergencies}. One formulation appears as ([Brunetti-Fredenhagen 00, theorem 4.3](perturbative+algebraic+quantum+field+theory#BrunettiFredenhagen00)). The above formulation in terms of the [[star product]] is stated in ([Fredenhagen-Rejzner 12, p. 27](perturbative+algebraic+quantum+field+theory#FredenhagenRejzner12), [Dütsch 18, lemma 3.63 (b)](perturbative+algebraic+quantum+field+theory#Duetsch18)).

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By [[induction]] over the number of arguments, it is sufficient to see that, more generally, for $A_1, A_2 \in PolyObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})_{mc}[ [ \hbar, g, j] ]$ two [[microcausal polynomial observables]] with disjoint spacetime support the star product $A_1 \star_F A_2$ is well-defined and satisfies causal factorization.

Consider two [[partitions of unity]]

$$
  (\chi_{1,i} \in C^\infty_{cp}(\Sigma))_{i}
  \phantom{AAA}
  (\chi_{1,j} \in C^\infty_{cp}(\Sigma))_{j}
$$

and write $(A_{1,i})_i$ and $(A_{2,j})_{j}$ for the collection of [[microcausal polynomial observables]] obtained by multiplying all the [[distribution|distributional]] [[coefficients]] of $A_1$ and of $A_2$ with $\chi_{1,i}$ and with $\chi_{2,j}$, respectively, for all $i$ and $j$, hence such that

$$
  A_1 \;=\; \underset{i}{\sum} A_{1,i}
  \phantom{AAA}
  A_2 \;=\; \underset{j}{\sum} A_{1,j}
  \,.
$$

By linearity, it is sufficient to prove that $A_{1,i} \star_F A_{2,j}$ is well defined for all $i,j$ and satisfies causal factorization.

Since the spacetime supports of $A_1$ and $A_2$ are assumed to be disjoint

$$
  supp(A_1) \cap supp(A_2) \;=\; \emptyset
$$

we may find partitions such that each resulting pair of smaller supports is in fact in [[causal order]]-relation:

$$
  \array{
    \left(
      supp(A_1) \cap supp(\chi_{1,i})
    \right)
       {\vee\!\!\!\wedge}
    \left(
      supp(A_2) \cap supp(\chi_{2,j})
    \right)
    \\
    \text{or}
    \\
    \left(
      supp(A_2) \cap supp(\chi_{2,j})
    \right)
       {\vee\!\!\!\wedge}
    \left(
      supp(A_1) \cap supp(\chi_{1,u})
    \right)
  }
  \phantom{AAAAA}
  \text{for all}\,\, i,j
  \,.
$$

But now it follows as in the proof of [this prop.](Wick+algebra#CausalOrderingTimeOrderedProductOnRegular) (via [this equation](Wick+algebra#eq:CausallyOrderedWickProductViaFeynmanPropagator)) that

$$
  A_{1,i}
   \star_F
  A_{2,j}
  \;=\;
  \left\{
    \array{
      A_{1,i} \star_H A_{2,j} &\vert& supp(A_{1,i}) {\vee\!\!\!\wedge} supp(A_{2,j})
      \\
      A_{2,j} \star_H A_{1,i} &\vert& supp(A_{2,j}) {\vee\!\!\!\wedge} supp(A_{1,i})
  }
  \right.
$$


Finally the [[associativity]]-statement follows as in [this prop.](star+product#AssociativeAndUnitalStarProduct).

Prop. \ref{TimeOrderedProductAwayFromDiagonal} implies that the
problem of constructing a sequence of [[time-ordered products]] (def. \ref{TimeOrderedProduct}), hence, by prop. \ref{TimeOrderedProductInducesPerturbativeSMatrix}, an [[S-matrix]] scheme (def. \ref{LagrangianFieldTheoryPerturbativeScattering}) for [[perturbative quantum field theory]] around the given [[free field]] [[vacuum]], is equivalently a problem of a sequence of compatible _[[extensions of distributions]]_ of the [[star products]] $\underset{k \; \text{arguments}}{\underbrace{(-)\star_F \cdots \star_F (-)}}$ of the [[Feynman propagator]] on $k$ arguments from the [[complement]] of coinciding [[events]] inside the [[Cartesian products]] $\Sigma^k$ of [[spacetime]] $\Sigma$, along the canonical inclusion

$$

Via the [[associativity]] (eq:RestrictedTimeOrderedProductAssociative) of the restricted [[time-ordered product]] thesese choices are naturally made by [[induction]] over $k$, choosing the $(k+1)$-ary [[time-ordered product]] $T_{k+1}$ as an [[extension of distributions]] of $T_k(\underset{k \, \text{args}}{\underbrace{-, \cdots, -}}) \star_F (-)$.

This [[induction|inductive]] choice of [[extension of distributions]] of the [[time-ordered product]] to coinciding interaction points deserves to be called a choice of _normalization_ of the [[time-ordered product]] (e.g. [Scharf 94, section 4.3](#Scharf95)), but for historical reasons (see remark \ref{TheTraditionalErrorThatLeadsToTheNotoriouDivergencies} and remark \ref{CausalPerturbationTheoryAbsenceOfUVDivergences}) it is known as _[[renormalization|re-normalization]]_.

In ([Epstein-Glaser 73](#EpsteinGlaser73)) this is phrased in terms of splitting of distributions.

In summary this says that for each free field vacuum, the space of [[renormalization schemes]] for [[perturbative QFT]] around this vacuum is non-empty and is canonically a [[torsor]] over the [[Stückelberg-Petermann renormalization group]].

Notice that theorem involves neither [[scaling transformations]] as in [[Gell-Mann-Low renormalization cocycles]], nor cutoffs as in Wilsonian [[effective field theory]]. But these perspective follow ([Brunetti-Dütsch-Fredenhagen 09](renormalization group#BrunettiDuetschFredenhagen09)).

#### Feynman perturbation series
 {#FeynmanDiagrams}


By def \ref{ExtensionOfTimeOrderedProoductsRenormalization} and the [[main theorem of perturbative renormalization]] (theorem \ref{PerturbativeRenormalizationMainTheorem}), the construction of perturbative [[S-matrix]] schemes/[[time-ordered products]] may be phrased as [[renormalization|("re-")normalization]] of the [[star product]] induced by the [[Feynman propagator]], namely as a choice of [[extension of distributions]] of the this star-product to the locus of coinciding interaction points.

Since the [[star product]] is the [[exponential]] of the binary contraction with the [[Feynman propagator]], it is naturally expanded as a [[sum]] of [[products of distributions]] labeled by [[finite multigraphs]] (def. \ref{Graphs} below),
where each [[vertex]] corresponds to an [[interaction]] or [[source field]] insertion, and where each [[edge]]
corresponds to one contractions of two of these with the [[Feynman propagator]]. The [[products of distributions]]
arising this way are the _[[Feynman amplitudes]]_ (prop. \ref{FeynmanPerturbationSeriesAwayFromCoincidingPoints} below).

If the [[free field]] [[vacuum]] is decomposed as a [[direct sum]] of distinct [[free field]] [[types]]/species, then
in addition to the [[vertices]] also the edges in these [[graphs]] receive labels, now by the field species whose particular [[Feynman propagator]] is being used in the contraction at that edges.
These labeled graphs are now called _[[Feynman diagrams]]_ (def. \ref{FeynmanDiagram} below) and the [[products of distributions]] which they encode are their _[[Feynman amplitudes]]_ built by the _[[Feynman rules]]_ (prop. \ref{FeynmanDiagramAmplitude} below).

The choice of [[renormalization|("re"-)normalization]] of the [[time-ordered products]]/[[S-matrix]] is thus equivalently a choice of [[renormalization|("re"-)normalization]] of the [[Feynman amplitudes]] for all possible [[Feynman diagrams]].
These are usefully organized in powers of $\hbar$ by their _[[loop order]]_ (prop. \ref{FeynmanDiagramLoopOrder} below).

In conclusion, the [[Feynman rules]] make the perturbative [[S-matrix]] be equal to a [[formal power series]]
of [[Feynman amplitudes]] labeled by [[Feynman graphs]]. As such it is known as the _[[Feynman perturbation series]]_ (example \ref{FeynmanPerturbationSeries} below).

Notice how it is therefore the [[combinatorics]] of [[star products]] that governs both [[Wick's lemma]] in [[free field theory]] as well as [[Feynman diagram|Feynman diagrammatics]] in [[interacting field theory]]:

###### Definition
**([[finite graph|finite]] [[multigraphs]])**

A _[[finite graph|finite]] [[multigraph]]_ is

1. a [[finite set]] $V$ ("of [[vertices]]");

1. a [[finite set]] $E$ ("of [[edges]]");

1. a [[function]] $E \overset{p}{\to} \left\{ {\,\atop \,} \{v_1, v_2\} = \{v_2, v_1\} \;\vert\; v_1, v_2 \in V \,,\; v_1 \neq v_2 {\, \atop \,} \right\}$

   (sending any [[edge]] to the unordered pair of distinct [[vertices]] that it goes between).

Hence the [[isomorphism class]] of a [[finite multigraph]] is specified by

1. a [[natural number]]

   $$
     v \coloneqq {\vert V\vert} \in \mathbb{N}
   $$

   (the number of [[vertices]]);

1. for each $i \lt j \in \{1, \cdots, v\}$ a natural number

   $$
     e_{i,j} \coloneqq {\vert p^{-1}(\{v_i,v_j\})\vert} \in \mathbb{N}
   $$

   (the number of [[edges]] between the $i$th and the $j$th vertex).

We write $\mathcal{G}_v$ for the set of such [[isomorphism classes]] of finite multigraphs with ${\vert V \vert} = v$ vertices;
and we write

$$
  \mathcal{G} \;\coloneqq\; \underset{v \in \mathbb{N}}{\sqcup} \mathcal{G}_v
$$

for the set of [[isomorphism classes]] of finite multigraphs with any number of vertices.

The combinatorial factor over the brace is the [[multinomial coefficient]] expressing the number of ways of distributing $e_{v+1}$-many functional derivatives to $v$ factors, via the [[product rule]], and quotiented by the [[factorial]] that comes from the [[exponential]] in the definition of the [[star product]].

Here in the first step we used the [[associativity]] (eq:RestrictedTimeOrderedProductAssociative) of the restricted time-ordered product, in the second step we used the induction assumption,
in the third we passed the outer functional derivatives through the pointwise product using the [[product rule]], and in the fourth step we recognized that this amounts to summing
in addition over all possible choices of sets of edges from the first $v$ vertices to the new $v+1$st vertex,
which yield in total the sum over all diagrams with $v+1$ vertices.

**(no [[tadpole]] [[Feynman diagrams]])**

In [[pQFT]] these diagrams are called _[[tadpoles]]_, and their non-appearance is considered part of the _[[Feynman rules]]_ (prop. \ref{FeynmanPerturbationSeriesAwayFromCoincidingPoints}).
Via prop. \ref{FeynmanPerturbationSeriesAwayFromCoincidingPoints} this condition reflects the nature of the [[star product]] ([this def.](star+product#PropagatorStarProduct)) which always contracts _different_ [[tensor product]] factors with the [[Feynman propagator]] before taking their pointwise product.

Beware that in [[graph theory]] these [[tadpoles]] are called "[[loops]]", while here in [[pQFT]] a "loop" in a [[planar graph]] refers instead to what in [[graph theory]] is called a _[[face]]_ of the graph, see the discussion of _[[loop order]]_ in prop. \ref{FeynmanDiagramLoopOrder} below.

#### Effective action
 {#EffectiveAction}

We have seen that the [[Feynman perturbation series]] expresses the [[S-matrix]] as a [[formal power series]] of _[[Feynman amplitudes]]_ labeled by _[[Feynman diagrams]]_. Now the [[Feynman amplitude]] associated with a [[disjoint union]] of [[connected graph|connected]] [[Feynman diagrams]] (def. \ref{ConnectedGraphs} below) is just the product of the amplitudes of the [[connected components]] (prop. \ref{LogarithmEffectiveAction} below). This allows to re-organize the [[Feynman perturbation series]] as the ordinary [[exponential]] of the Feynman perturbation series restricted to just [[connected graph|connected]] Feynman diagrams. The latter is called the _[[effective action]]_ (def. \ref{InPerturbationTheoryActionEffective} below) because it allows to express [[vacuum expectation values]] of the [[S-matrix]] as an ordinary exponential (equation (eq:ExponentialSeffVEVOfSMatrix) below).

Given two [[finite multigraphs]] $\Gamma_1, \Gamma_2 \in \mathcal{G}$ (def. \ref{Graphs}), their [[disjoint union]]

$$
  \Gamma_1 \sqcup \Gamma_2
  \;\in\;
  \mathcal{G}
$$

is the finite multigraph whose set of [[vertices]] and set of [[edges]] are the [[disjoint unions]] of the corresponding sets of $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$

$$
  V_{\Gamma_1 \sqcup \Gamma_2}
    \;\coloneqq\;
  V_{\Gamma_1} \sqcup V_{\Gamma_2}

$$
  E_{\Gamma_1 \sqcup \Gamma_2}

and whose vertex-assigning function $p$ is the corresponding function on disjoint unions

$$
  p_{\Gamma_1 \sqcup \Gamma_2}
  \;\coloneqq\;
  p_{\Gamma_1} \sqcup p_{\Gamma_2}

The operation induces a pairing on the set $\mathcal{G}$ of [[isomorphism classes]] of [[finite multigraphs]]

$$

$$

A [[finite multigraph]] $\Gamma \in \mathcal{G}$ (def. \ref{Graphs}) is called _[[connected graph|connected]]_ if it is not the [[disjoint union]] of two [[inhabited|non-empty]] finite multigraphs.

We write

$$
  \mathcal{G}_{conn}
  \subset
  \mathcal{G}
$$

for the subset of [[isomorphism classes]] of [[connected graph|connected]] [[finite multigraphs]].

Let $(E_{\text{BV-BRST}}, \mathbf{L}', \Delta_H )$ be a [[relativistic field theory|relativistic]] [[free field theory|free]] [[vacuum]] according to def. \ref{VacuumFree}, let $\mathcal{S}$ be an [[S-matrix]] scheme for [[perturbative QFT]] around this vacuum (def. \ref{LagrangianFieldTheoryPerturbativeScattering}) and let

be a [[local observable]].

Recall that for each [[finite multigraph]] $\Gamma \in \mathcal{G}$ (def. \ref{Graphs}) the [[Feynman perturbation series]] for $\mathcal{S}(g S_{int} + j A)$ (example \ref{FeynmanPerturbationSeries})

$$
  \mathcal{S}(g S_{int} + j A)

of [[Feynman amplitudes]] that are labeled only by the _[[connected graphs]]_  $\Gamma \in \mathcal{G}_{conn} \subset \mathcal{G}$ (def. \ref{ConnectedGraphs}).

The terminology "effective action" is due to the following fact:

+-- {: .num_prop #LogarithmEffectiveAction}
###### Proposition
**([[effective action]] is [[logarithm]] of [[S-matrix]])**

Let $(E_{\text{BV-BRST}}, \mathbf{L}', \Delta_H )$ be a [[relativistic field theory|relativistic]] [[free field theory|free]] [[vacuum]] according to def. \ref{VacuumFree}, let $\mathcal{S}$ be an [[S-matrix]] scheme for [[perturbative QFT]] around this vacuum (def. \ref{LagrangianFieldTheoryPerturbativeScattering}) and let

$$
  g S_{int} + j A
  \;\in\;
  LocObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})[ [ \hbar, g, h ] ]
$$

be a [[local observable]] and let

$$
  S_{eff} \;\in\; PolyObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})((\hbar))[ [ g, j] ]
$$

be the corresponding [[effective action]] (def. \ref{InPerturbationTheoryActionEffective}).

Then then [[S-matrix]] for $g S_{int} + j A$ is the [[exponential]] of the [[effective action]] with respect to the pointwise product $(-)\cdot (-)$ of observables ([this def.](A+first+idea+of+quantum+field+theory#Observable)):

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \mathcal{S}(g S_{int} + j A)
    & =
    \exp_\cdot\left( \tfrac{1}{i \hbar} S_{eff}  \right)
    \\
    & \coloneqq
    1
      +
    \frac{1}{i \hbar} S_{eff}
      +
    \frac{1}{(i \hbar)^2} S_{eff} \cdot S_{eff}
      +
    \frac{1}{(i \hbar)^3} S_{eff} \cdot S_{eff} \cdot S_{eff}
      +
    \cdots
  \end{aligned}
$$

Moreover, this relation passes to the [[vacuum expectation values]]:

$$
  \label{ExponentialSeffVEVOfSMatrix}
  \begin{aligned}
    \left\langle
      {\, \atop \,}
      \mathcal{S}(g S_{int} + j A)
      {\, \atop \,}
    \right\rangle
    & =
    \left\langle
      {\, \atop \,}
      \exp\left(
        \tfrac{1}{i \hbar} S_{eff}
      \right)

    \right\rangle
    \\
    & =
    e^{\tfrac{1}{i \hbar} \langle S_{eff}\rangle}
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

Conversely the [[vacuum expectation value]] of the [[effective action]] is to the [[logarithm]] of that of the S-matrix:

$$
  \left\langle
    S_{eff}
  \right\rangle
  \;=\;
  i \hbar
  \,
  \ln
  \left\langle
    \mathcal{S}(g S_{int} + j A)
  \right\rangle
  \,.
$$

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By prop. \ref{TimeOrderedProductAwayFromDiagonal} the contributions to the S-matrix away from coinciding interaction points are given by the [[star product]] induced by the [[Feynman propagator]], and specifically, by prop. \ref{FeynmanPerturbationSeriesAwayFromCoincidingPoints}, the [[Feynman amplitudes]] are given this way. Now by definition of the star product ([this def.](star+product#PropagatorStarProduct)) it is given by first contracting with powers of the [[Feynman propagator]] and then multiplying all resulting terms with the pointwise product of observables. From this and the nature of the combinatorial factor in the definition of the [[Feynman amplitudes]] (prop. \ref{FeynmanPerturbationSeriesAwayFromCoincidingPoints}) it is clear that for

$$
  \Gamma
    \;=\;
  \Gamma_1
    \sqcup
  \Gamma_2
    \sqcup
    \cdots
    \sqcup
  \Gamma_n
  \;\in\; \mathcal{G}
$$

a [[disjoint union]] of graphs (def. \ref{ConnectedGraphs}), then then corresponding [[Feynman amplitudes]] multiply by the pointwise product

$$
  \Gamma(g S_{int} + j A)
  \;=\;
  \Gamma_1\left( (g S_{int} + j A)_{i = 1}^{v(\Gamma_1)}\right)
   \cdot
  \Gamma_2\left( (g S_{int} + j A)_{i = 1}^{v(\Gamma_2)} \right)
    \cdot
    \cdots
    \cdot
  \Gamma_n\left( (g S_{int} + j A)_{i = 1}^{v(\Gamma_n)} \right)
  \,.
$$

This implies that the summands in the $n$th powers of $\frac{1}{i \hbar}$ times the effective action are precisely the Feynman amplitudes of Feynman diagrams with $n$ [[connected components]], where each such appears with multiplicity given by the [[factorial]] of $n$:

$$
  \frac{1}{n!}
  \left(
    \frac{1}{i \hbar}
    S_{eff}
  \right)^n
  \;=\;
  \Gamma(g S_{int} + j A)
  \underset{
     { \Gamma = \underoverset{j = 1}{n}{\sqcup} \Gamma_j }
     \atop
     { \Gamma_j \in \mathcal{G}_{conn} }
  }{\sum}
  \,.
$$

It follows that

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \exp_\cdot\left(
      \frac{1}{i \hbar} S_{int}
    \right)
    & =
    \underset{n \in \mathbb{N}}{\sum}
    \underset{
       { \Gamma = \underoverset{j = 1}{n}{\sqcup} \Gamma_j }
       \atop
       { \Gamma_j \in \mathcal{G}_{conn} }
    }{\sum}
    \Gamma\left( (g S_{int} + j A)_{i = 1}^{v(\Gamma)} \right)
    \\
    & =
    \underset{\Gamma \in \mathcal{G}}{\sum}
    \Gamma\left( (g S_{int} + j A)_{i = 1}^{v(\Gamma)} \right)
  \end{aligned}
$$

yields the [[Feynman perturbation series]] by expressing it as a series (re-)organized by number of [[connected components]] of the [[Feynman diagrams]].

To conclude the proof it is now sufficient to observe that taking [[vacuum expectation values]] of [[polynomial observables]] respects the pointwise product of observables

$$
  \left\langle A_1 \cdot A_2 \right\rangle
  \;=\;
  \left\langle
    A_1
  \right\rangle
  \,
  \left\langle
    A_2
  \right\rangle
$$

because the [[Hadamard vacuum state]] $\langle -\rangle \colon PolyObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})[ [ \hbar, g, j] ]  \to \mathbb{C}[ [\hbar, g, j ] ]$ simply picks the zero-order monomial term, by [this prop.](Wick+algebra#WickAlgebraCanonicalState).

###### Proposition
**([[loop order]] and [[tree level]] of [[Feynman diagrams]])**

Let $\Gamma$ be a [[finite multigraph]] (def. \ref{Graphs}) which is [[planar graph|planar]] and [[connected graph|connected]] (def. \ref{ConnectedGraphs}). Then the order of $\hbar$ at which its [[Feynman amplitude]] (def. \ref{FeynmanPerturbationSeriesAwayFromCoincidingPoints}) contributes in the [[effective action]] (def. \ref{InPerturbationTheoryActionEffective}) is

$$
  \hbar^{L(\Gamma)}
  \,,
$$

where $L(\Gamma) \in \mathbb{N}$ is the number of _[[faces]]_ of the [[planar graph]] $\Gamma$, here called the _number of loops_ of the diagram.

Accordingly, the order in $\hbar$ at which the [[Feynman amplitude]] of a [[planar graph|planar]] [[connected graph|connected]] [[Feynman diagram]] contributes is often referred to as the _loop order_.

(Beware the terminology clash with [[graph theory]], see the discussion of [[tadpoles]] in remark \ref{Tadpoles}.)

Since a [[graph]] without loops, in this sense, is called a _[[tree]]_, contributions at loop order $L(\Gamma) = 0$, hence those that contribute in the _[[classical limit]]_ $\hbar \to 0$, are often called the _[[tree level]]_ contributions.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


By def. \ref{LagrangianFieldTheoryPerturbativeScattering} the explicit $\hbar$-dependence of the [[S-matrix]] is

$$
  \mathcal{S}
  \left(
    S_{int}
  \right)
  \;=\;
  \underset{k \in \mathbb{N}}{\sum}
    \frac{1}{k!}
    \frac{1}{(i \hbar)^k}
    T( \underset{k \, \text{factors}}{\underbrace{S_{int}, \cdots,  S_{int}}} )
$$

and by prop. \ref{TimeOrderedProductAwayFromDiagonal} the further $\hbar$-dependence of the [[time-ordered product]] $T(\cdots)$ is

$$
  T(S_{int}, S_{int})
  \;=\;
  prod \circ
  \exp\left(
    \hbar
    \left\langle
      \Delta_F,
      \frac{\delta}{\delta \mathbf{\Phi}}
        \otimes
      \frac{\delta}{\delta \mathbf{\Phi}}
    \right\rangle
  \right)
 ( S_{int} \otimes S_{int} )
  \,,
$$

By the [[Feynman rules]] (prop. \ref{FeynmanPerturbationSeriesAwayFromCoincidingPoints}) this means that

1. each [[vertex]] of the Feynman diagram contributes a power $\hbar^{-1}$;

1. each [[edge]] of the Feynman diagram contributes a power $\hbar^1$.

If we write

$$
  E(\Gamma), V(\Gamma) \;\in\; \mathcal{N}
$$

for the total number of [[vertices]] and [[edges]], respectively, in $\Gamma$, this means that $\Gamma$ contributes at the power

$$
  \hbar^{E(\Gamma) - V(\Gamma)}
  \,.
$$

So far this holds for arbitrary $\Gamma$. Now using the assumption that $\Gamma$ is [[planar graph|planar]], then the formula for the _[[Euler characteristic of planar graphs]]_ says that

$$
  E(\Gamma) - V(\Gamma)
  \;=\;
  L(\Gamma) - 1
  \,.
$$

Hence $\hbar^{L(\Gamma)- 1}$ is the order of $\hbar$ at which $\Gamma$ contributes to the [[scattering matrix]] expressed as the [[Feynman perturbation series]].

Finally, the [[effective action]], by definition (eq:ExpansionEffectiveAction), has the same contributions (for connected Feynman diagrams) but multiplied by another power of $\hbar^1$. This yields the claim.

### In functorial quantum field theory

At least the _idea_ of the S-matrix is very explicit in the Atiyah-Segal picture of _functorial QFT_ ([[FQFT]]).

Here a quantum field theory is given by a [[functor]]

$$
 Z \colon Bord_d^S \longrightarrow Vect
$$

from a suitable [[category of cobordisms]] to a suitable [[category]] of [[vector spaces]].

* To a codimension-1 slice $M_{d-1}$ of space this assigns a vector space $Z(M_{d-1})$ -- the (Hilbert) [[space of quantum states]] over $M_{d-1}$;

* to a [[spacetime]]/[[worldvolume]] manifold $M$ with [[boundaries]] $\partial M$ one assigns the quantum propagator which is the linear map $Z(M) : Z(\partial_{in} M) \to Z(\partial_{out} M)$ that takes incoming states to outgoing states via propagation along the spacetime/worldvolume $M$. This $Z(M)$ is alternatively known as the  the _[[scattering amplitude]]_ or _S-matrix_ for propagation from $\partial_{in}M$ to $\partial_{out}M$ along a process of shape $M$.

Now for genuine [[topological field theories]] all spaces of quantum states are [[finite number|finite]] [[dimension|dimensional]] and hence we can equivalently consider the [[dual vector space]] (using that finite dimensional vector spaces form a [[compact closed category]]). Doing so the propagator map

$$
  Z(M) : Z(\partial_{in}M) \to Z(\partial_{out}M)
$$

equivalently becomes a linear map of the form

$$
  \mathbb{C} \to Z(\partial_{out}M) \otimes Z(\partial_{in}M)^\ast = Z(\partial M)
  \,.
$$

Notice that such a linear map from the canonical 1-dimensional complex vector space $\mathbb{C}$ to some other vector space is equivalently just a choice of element in that vector space. It is in this sense that $Z(M)$ is equivalently a vector in $Z(\partial_{out}M) \otimes Z(\partial_{in}M)^\ast = Z(\partial M)$.

In this form in physics the propagator is usually called the _[[correlator]]_ or _[[n-point function]]_ .

Segal's axioms for [[FQFT]] ([[CFT]] in his case) were originally explicitly about the propagators/S-matrices, while Atiyah formulated it in terms of the correlators this way. Both perspectives go over into each other under duality as above.

Notice that this kind of discussion is not restricted to topological field theory. For instance already plain quantum mechanics is usefully formulated this way, that's the point of [[finite quantum mechanics in terms of dagger-compact categories]].

## History
 {#History}


In the 1960s there was a prominent proposal, around [[Geoffrey Chew]], that ([[perturbative quantum field theory|perturbative]]) [[quantum field theory]] should be _defined_ by [[axiom|axiomatizing]] properties of the S-matrix _without_ explicit reference to [[field (physics)|fields]] on [[spacetime]].

Here _analycity_ (or more general the _crossing property_) of the S-matrix reflects its [[causal factorization]], and hence this is often referred to as the _analytic S-matrix_ (see [Eden-Ladshoff-Olive-Polkinhorne 66](#EdenLadshoffOlivePolkinhorne66)).

This is a radical perspective where no [[spacetime]] geometry and physical fields are made explicit, but where the entire physics is encoded by what quantum particles see that scatter through it.

Historically, this S-matrix "bootstrap" approach fell out of fashion with the success of the [[quark]] model in  [[quantum chromodynamics]], which is a [[local field theory|local]] [[Lagrangian field theory]] ([[Yang-Mills theory]]) defined in terms of [[field (physics)|fields]] on [[spacetime]].

See also the discussion in ([Chew 70](#Chew70), [Schroer 11](#Schroer11)).

But later [[perturbative string theory]] revived the axiomatic S-matrix perspective. In general, perturbative string theory is not defined by a geometric spacetime background. Instead the background is algebraically encoded by a [[2d SCFT]] ("[[2-spectral triple]]") and the [[string perturbation series]] is a formula that translates this into an S-matrix. Spacetime physics then is whatever is seen by string scattering processes (see also at _[string theory FAQ -- What are the equations of string theory?](string%20theory%20FAQ#WhatAreTheEquations)_).

More recently, the S-matrix perspective becomes fashionable also in [[Yang-Mills theory]], at least in [[super Yang-Mills theory]]: one observes that the theory enjoys good structures in its scattering amplitudes which are
essentially invisible in the vast summation of [[Feynman diagrams]] that extract the S-matrix from the [[action functional]]. Instead there are entirely different mathematical structures that encode at least some sub-class of scattering amplitudes (see at _[[amplituhedron]]_).

{#RonMaimonOnHistory} From [this physics.SE comment](http://physics.stackexchange.com/a/15164/5603) by [[Ron Maimon]]:

> The history of [[physics]] cannot be well understood without appreciating the unbelievable antagonism between the [[Geoffrey Chew|Chew]]/[[Stanley Mandelstam|Mandelstam]]/[[Vladimir Gribov|Gribov]] S-matrix camp, and the [[Steven Weinberg|Weinberg]]/[[Sheldon Glashow|Glashow]]/[[Alexander Polyakov|Polyakov]] [[quantum field theory|Field theory]] camp. The two sides hated each other, did not hire each other, and did not read each other, at least not in the west. The only people that straddled both camps were older folks and Russians--- [[Murray Gell-Mann|Gell-Mann]] more than [[Lev Landau|Landau]] (who believed the [[Landau pole]] implied the S-matrix), Gribov and Migdal more than anyone else in the west other than [[Murray Gell-Mann|Gell-Mann]] and [[Kenneth Wilson|Wilson]]. Wilson did his PhD in S-matrix theory, for example, as did [[David Gross]] (under Chew).

> In the 1970s, S-matrix theory just plain died. All practitioners jumped ship rapidly in 1974, with the triple-whammy of [[effective field theory|Wilsonian field theory]], the discovery of the Charm [[quark]], and [[asymptotic freedom]]. These results killed S-matrix theory for thirty years. Those that jumped ship include all the original [[string theory|string theorists]] who stayed employed: notably [[Gabriele Veneziano|Veneziano]], who was convinced that [[gauge theory]] was right when [[Gerard 't Hooft|t'Hooft]] showed that [[AdS-CFT|large-N gauge fields]] give the string topological expansion, and [[Leonard Susskind|Susskind]], who didn't mention Regge theory after the early 1970s. Everybody stopped studying [[string theory]] except [[Joël Scherk|Scherk]] and [[John Schwarz|Schwarz]], and Schwarz was protected by
[[Murray Gell-Mann|Gell-Mann]], or else he would never have been tenured and funded.

> This sorry history means that not a single S-matrix theory course is taught in the curriculum today, nobody studies it except a few theorists of advanced age hidden away in particle accelerators, and the main S-matrix theory, [[string theory]], is not properly explained and remains completely enigmatic even to most physicists. There were some good reasons for this --- some S-matrix people said silly things about the consistency of quantum field theory --- but to be fair, [[quantum field theory]] people said equally silly things about S-matrix theory.

> [[Steven Weinberg|Weinberg]] came up with these heuristic arguments in the 1960s, which convinced him that S-matrix theory was a dead end, or rather, to show that it was a tautological synonym for quantum field theory. Weinberg was motivated by models of pion-nucleon interactions, which was a hot S-matrix topic in the early 1960s. The solution to the problem is the [[chiral symmetry breaking]] models of the pion condensate, and these are [[effective field theories]].

> Building on this result, Weinberg became convinced that the only real solution to the S-matrix was a field theory of some particles with spin. He still says this every once in a while, but it is dead wrong. The most charitable interpretation is that every S-matrix has a field theory limit, where all but a finite number of particles decouple, but this is not true either (consider [[little string theory]]). String theory exists, and there are non-field theoretic S-matrices, namely all the ones in [[string theory]], including [[little string theory]] in (5+1)d, which is non-gravitational.

From ([Weinberg 09, p. 11](#Weinberg09)):

> I offered this in my 1979 paper as what [[Arthur Wightman]] would call a [[folk theorem]]: "if one writes down the most general possible [[Lagrangian]], including all terms consistent with assumed [[symmetry]] principles, and then calculates [[scattering amplitudes|matrix elements]] with this Lagrangian to any given order of [[perturbation theory]], the result will simply be the most general possible S-matrix consistent with perturbative unitarity, analyticity, [[cluster decomposition]], and the assumed symmetry properties."

> There was an interesting irony in this. I had been at Berkeley from 1959 to 1966, when [[Geoffrey Chew]] and his collaborators were elaborating a program for calculating S-matrix elements for [[strong nuclear force|strong interaction]] processes by the use of unitarity, analyticity, and Lorentz invariance, without reference to [[quantum field theory]]. I found it an attractive philosophy, because it relied only on a minimum of principles, all well established. Unfortunately, the S-matrix theorists were never able to develop a reliable method of calculation, so I worked instead on other things, including [[current algebra]]. Now in 1979 I realized that the assumptions of S-matrix theory, supplemented by chiral invariance, were indeed all that are needed at low energy, but the most convenient way of implementing these assumptions in actual calculations was by good old quantum field theory, which the S-matrix theorists had hoped to supplant.
