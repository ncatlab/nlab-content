## Idea

In [[quantum field theory]] a _[[scattering amplitude]]_ or _scattering matrix_  or _S-matrix_ encodes the [[probability amplitudes]] for scatterings processes of [[particles]] off each other.


Every [[perturbative quantum field theory]] has an S-matrix, usually thought of as a [[perturbation series]] over [[Feynman diagrams]] extracted from the [[action functional]].  The rigorous construction of this as an [[operator-valued distribution]] is the content of _[[causal perturbation theory]]_.

But there are also S-matrices not arising from a local field theory, for instance the [[string scattering amplitudes]].

The perception of the relevance of the S-matrix for the foundations of quantum field theory has a convoluted (and ongoing) history, see [below](#History).

### In quantum mechanics
 {#InQuantumMechanics}

In [[quantum mechanics]], let $\mathcal{H}$ be some [[Hilbert space]] and let

$$
  H = H_{free} + V
$$

be Hermitian operator, thought of as a [[Hamiltonian]], decomposed as the [[sum]] of a free part ([[kinetic energy]]) and an interaction part ([[potential energy]]).

For example for a  [[non-relativistic particle]] of [[mass]] $m$ propagating on the [[line]] subject to a [[potential energy]] $V_{pot} \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, then $\mathcal{H} = L^2(X)$ is the Hilbert space space of [[square integrable functions]] and

$$
  H
   =
  \underset{H_{free}}{\underbrace{\tfrac{- \hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial^2 x}}}
    +
  V
  \,,
$$

where $V = V_{pot}(x)$ is the operator of multiplying square integrable functions with the given potential energy function.

Now for

$$
  \array{
    \mathbb{R} &\overset{\vert \psi (-)\rangle }{\longrightarrow}& \mathcal{H}
   \\
   t &\mapsto& \vert \psi(t) \rangle
  }
$$

a one-parameter family of [[quantum states]], the [[Schrödinger equation]] for this state reads

$$
  \frac{d}{d t} \vert \psi(t) \rangle
  \;=\;
  \tfrac{1}{i \hbar} H \vert \psi\rangle
  \,.
$$

It is easy to solve this [[differential equation]] formally via its [[Green function]]: for $\vert \psi \rangle \in \mathcal{H}$ any state, then the unique solution $\vert \psi(-) \rangle$ to the Schrödinger equation subject to $\vert \psi(0) \rangle = \vert \psi \rangle$ is

$$
  \vert \psi(t)\rangle_S \coloneqq \exp( \tfrac{t}{i \hbar} H ) \vert \psi \rangle
  \,.
$$

(One says that this is the solution "in the [[Schrödinger picture]]", whence the subscript.)

However, if $H$ is sufficiently complicated, it may still be very hard to extract from this expression a more explicit formula for $\vert \psi(t) \rangle$, such as, in the example of the free particle on the line, its expression as a function ("[[wave function]]") of $x$ and $t$.

But assume that the analogous expression for $H_{free}$ alone is well understood, hence that the operator

$$
  U_{S,free}(t_1, t_2) \coloneqq \exp\left({\tfrac{t_2 - t_1}{i \hbar} H_{free}}\right)
$$

is sufficiently well understood. The "[[interaction picture]]" is a way to decompose the Schrödinger equation such that its dependence on $V$ gets separated from its dependence on $H_{free}$ in a way that admits to treat $H_{int}$ in [[perturbation theory]].

Namely define analogously

\[
  \label{StateInTheInteractionPicture}
  \begin{aligned}
    \vert \psi(t)\rangle_I
     &\coloneqq
     \exp\left({\tfrac{- t}{i \hbar} H_{free}}\right) \vert \psi(t)\rangle_S
    \\
    & = \exp\left({\tfrac{- t}{i \hbar} H_{free}}\right)
        \exp\left({ \tfrac{+ t}{i \hbar} H} \right)\vert \psi \rangle
    \\
    & = \exp\left({\tfrac{- t}{i \hbar} H_{free}}\right)
        \exp\left({\tfrac{t}{i \hbar} H_{free} + \tfrac{t}{i \hbar} V} \right)\vert \psi \rangle   \end{aligned}
  \,.
\]

This is called the solution of the Schrödinger equation "in the [[interaction picture]]", whence the subscript. Its definition may be read as the result of propagating the actual solution $\vert \psi(-)\rangle_S$ at time $t$ back to time $t = 0$, but using just the free Hamiltonian, hence with "the interaction switched off".

Notice that if the operator $V$ were to commute with $H_{free}$ (which it does not in all relevant examples) then we would simply have $\vert \psi(t)\rangle_I = \exp( \tfrac{t}{i \hbar } V ) \vert \psi\rangle$, hence then the solution (eq:StateInTheInteractionPicture) in the interaction picture would be the result of "propagating" the initial conditions using _only_ the interaction. Now since $V$ may not be assumed to commute with $H_{free}$, the actual form of $\vert \psi(-) \rangle_{I}$ is more complicated. But _infinitesimally_ it remains true that $\vert \psi(-)\rangle_I$ is propagated this way, not by the plain operator $V$, though, but by $V$ viewed in the [[Heisenberg picture]] of the free theory. This is the content of the differential equation (eq:DifferentialEquationInInteractionPicture) below.

But first notice that this will indeed be useful: If an explicit expression for the "state in the [[interaction picture]]" (eq:StateInTheInteractionPicture) is known, then the assumption that also the operator $\exp\left({\tfrac{t}{i \hbar} H_{free}}\right)$ is sufficiently well understood implies that the actual solution

$$
  \vert \psi(t) \rangle_S = \exp\left({\tfrac{t}{i \hbar} H_{free}}\right) \vert \psi(t) \rangle_I
$$

is under control. Hence the question now is how to find $\vert \psi(-)\rangle_I$ given its value at some time $t$. (It is conventional to consider this for $t \to \pm \infty$, see (eq:SMatrixInQuantumMechanics) below.)

Now it is clear from the construction and using the [[product law]] for [[differentiation]], that $\vert \psi(-)\rangle_S$ satisfies the following [[differential equation]]:

\[
  \label{DifferentialEquationInInteractionPicture}
  \frac{d}{d t} \vert \psi(t) \rangle
  \;=\;
  V_I(t) \vert \psi(t)\rangle_I
  \,,
\]

where

$$
  V_I(t)
    \coloneqq
  \exp\left( -\tfrac{t}{i \hbar} H_{free} \right)
    V
  \exp\left( +\tfrac{t}{i \hbar} H_{free} \right)
$$

is known as the [[interaction]] term $V$ "viewed in the interaction picture". But in fact this is just $V$ "viewed in the [[Heisenberg picture]]", but for the _free_ theory. By our running assumption that the free theory is well understood, also $V_I(t)$ is well understood, and hence all that remains now is to find a sufficiently concrete solution to equation (eq:DifferentialEquationInInteractionPicture). This is the heart of working in the interaction picture.

Solutions to equations of the "[[parallel transport]]"-type such as (eq:DifferentialEquationInInteractionPicture) are given by [[time-ordered product|time-ordering]] of Heisenberg picture operators, denoted $T$, applied to the naive exponential solution as above. This is known as the _[[Dyson formula]]_:

$$
  \vert \psi(t)\rangle_I
  \;=\;
  T\left(
    \exp\left(
      \int_{t_0}^t
        V_I(t)
        \tfrac{d t}{i \hbar}
    \right)
  \right)
  \vert \psi(t_0)\rangle
  \,.
$$

Here [[time-ordered product|time-ordering]] means

$$
  T( V_I(t_1) V_I(t_2) )
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \left\{
    \array{
      V_I(t_1) V_I(t_2) &\vert& t_1 \geq t_2
      \\
      V_I(t_2) V_I(t_1) &\vert& t_2 \geq t_2
    }
  \right.
  \,.
$$

(This is abuse of notation: Strictly speaking time ordering acts on the [[tensor algebra]] spanned by the $\{V_I(t)\}_{t \in \mathbb{R}}$ and has to be _folllowed_ by taking tensor products to actual products. )

In applications to [[scattering]] processes one is interest in prescribing the [[quantum state]]/[[wave function]] far in the past, hence for $t \to - \infty$, and computing its form far in the future, hence for $t \to \infty$.

The operator that sends such "asymptotic ingoing-states" $\vert \psi(-\infty) \rangle_I$ to "asymptic outgoing states" $\vert \psi(+ \infty) \rangle_I$ is hence the [[limit of a sequence|limit]]

\[
  \label{SMatrixInQuantumMechanics}
  S
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \underset{t \to \infty}{\lim}
  T\left(
    \exp\left(
      \int_{-t}^t
        V_I(t)
        \tfrac{d t}{i \hbar}
    \right)
  \right)
  \,.
\]

This limit (if it exists) is called the _scattering matrix_ or _S-matrix_, for short.


### In perturbative algebraic quantum field theory


In [[perturbative algebraic quantum field theory]] the broad structure of the [[interaction picture]] in [[quantum mechanics]] ([above](#InQuantumMechanics)) remains a very good guide, but various technical details have to be generalized with due care:

1. The algebra of operators in the [[Heisenberg picture]] of the free theory becomes the _[[Wick algebra]]_ of the [[free field theory]] (taking into account "normal ordering" of field operators) defined on _[[microcausal functionals]]_ built from [[operator-valued distributions]] with constraints on their [[wave front set]].

1. The [[time-ordered products]] in the [[Dyson formula]] have to be refined to [[causal locality|causally ordered]] products and the resulting product at coincident points has to be defined by [[point-extension of distributions]] -- the freedom in making this choice is the [[renormalization]] freedom ("conter-terms").

1. The sharp interaction cutoff in the [[Dyson formula]] that is hidden in the integration over $[t_0,t]$ has to be smoothed out by [[adiabatic switching]] of the interaction (making the whole S-matrix an [[operator-valued distribution]]).

Together these three point are taken care of by the axiomatization of the "[[adiabatic switching|adiabatically switched]] [[S-matrix]]" according to **[[causal perturbation theory]]**.


The analogue of the limit $t \to \infty$ in the construction of the [[S-matrix]] (now: [[adiabatic limit]]) in general does not exist in field theory ("infrared divergencies"). But in fact it need not be taken: The field algebra in a bounded region of [[spacetime]] may be computed with any adiabatic switching that is constant on this region. Moreover, the algebras assigned to regions of spacetime this way satisfy [[causal locality]] by the causal ordering in the construction of the S-matrix. Therefore, even without taking the adiabtic limit in [[causal perturbation theory]] one obtains a field theory in the form of a _[[local net of observables]]_. This is the topic of **[[locally covariant perturbative quantum field theory]]**.

#### Preliminaries


In all of the following, let

$$
  d \in \mathbb{N}

the [[spacetime]] [[dimension]].

Write

$$
  \mathbb{R}^{d-1,1} \coloneqq (\mathbb{R}^{d}, \eta)
$$

for [[Minkowski spacetime]] of dimension $d$, hence for the [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]] whose underlying
[[smooth manifold]] is the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^d$ and whose [[metric tensor]] is

$$
  \eta = - d x^0 \otimes d x^0 + d x^1 \otimes d x^1 + \cdots + d x^{d-1} \otimes d x^{d-1}
 \,,
$$

where $x^\mu \;\colon\; \mathbb{R}^d \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ with $\mu \in \{0, \cdots, d-1\}$ denote the canonical [[coordinate]] functions.

For $x \in \mathbb{R}^{d-1,1}$ a point in spacetime, we write


For $x \in \mathbb{R}^{d-1,1}$ a point in spacetime, we write

$$
  V^+(x), V^-(x) \subset \mathbb{R}^{d-1,1}
$$

for its [[open future cone]] and [[open past cone]], respectively, and

$$
  \overline{V}^+(x), \overline{V}^-(x) \subset \mathbb{R}^{d-1,1}
$$

for the corresponding closed cones.

For $S \subset \mathbb{R}^{d-1,1}$ a [[subset]] we write

$$
  \overline{V}^\pm(S)
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \underset{x \in S}{\cup} \overline{V}^{\pm}(x)
$$

for the union of the future/past closed cones of all its points.


Consider the [[relation]] on the set $P(\mathbb{R}^{d})$ of [[subsets]] of spacetime given by

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    (S_1 \geq S_2)
    & \coloneqq
    S_1 \cap \overline{V}^-(S_2) = \emptyset
    \\
    \Leftrightarrow & S_2 \cap \overline{V}^+(S_1) = \emptyset
   \end{aligned}
   \,.
$$

If $S_1 \geq S_2$ and $S_2 \geq S_1$ we say that the two subsets are _[[spacelike]] separated_.

#### Perturbative S-Matrix and Time-ordered products
 {#PerturbativeSMatrixAndTimeOrderedProducts}

Write $\Sigma \coloneqq \mathbb{R}^{d-1,1}$.

Let $E \to \Sigma$ be a [[field bundle]], write $\Gamma_\Sigma(E)$ for its space of [[smooth sections]].

###### Definition
**(compactly supported polynomial local densities)**

Write

$$
  \Omega_{poly}^{h,v}(E) \hookrightarrow \Omega^{h,v}(E)
$$

for the space of differential forms on the [[jet bundle]] of $E$ which locally are [[polynomials]]
in the field variables (but not necessarily in the coordinates on $\Sigma$). In particular
$\Omega_{poly}^{d,0}(E) \hookrightarrow \Omega^{d,0}(E)$ is the subspace of [[local Lagrangian densities]]
which locally depend polynomially on the fields and their derivatives.

Write then

$$
  \mathcal{F}_{loc}
    \; \coloneqq \;
  C^\infty_c(\Sigma) \underset{\Omega_{poly}^{0,0}(E)}{\otimes} \Omega_{poly}^{d,0}(E)
$$

for the subspace of [[local Lagrangian densities]]
which are [[compact support|compactly supported]] with respect to $\Sigma$ and [[polynomial]] with respect to the
field variables.

Every $L \in \mathcal{F}_{loc}$ induces a functional

$$
   \Gamma_\Sigma(E) \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$

by [[integration of differential forms|integration]] of the [[pullback of differential forms|pullback]]
of $L$ along the [[jet prolongation]] of a given [[section]]:

$$
  \phi \mapsto \int_{\Sigma} j^\infty(\phi)^\ast L
  \,.
$$

These functionals happen to be [[microcausal functional|microcausal]] (by [this example](microcausal+functional#CompactlySupportedPolynomialLocalDensities)), so that there is an inclusion

$$
  \mathcal{F}_{loc} \hookrightarrow \mathcal{F}_{mc}
$$

into the space of [[microcausal functionals]].

=--

In the following we need to keep track of powers of the [[coupling constant]] and the [[source field]].
To that end, we write $\langle g,j\rangle$ be the vector space spanned by the elements $g$ and $j$ and

$$
  \mathcal{F}_{loc} \langle g,j\rangle
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \mathcal{F}_{loc} \otimes \langle g,j\rangle
$$

Then every element of $\mathcal{F}_{loc}\langle g,j \rangle$ may be presented as

$$
  \underset{n_1}{\sum} g_{sw,n_1} L_{n_1} + \underset{n_2}{\sum} j_{sw,n_2} A_{n_2}
$$

where $L_{n_1}, L_{n_2} \in \Omega_{poly}^{d,0}(E)$ are polynomial local densities, to be regarded
as [[interaction]] [[Lagrangian densities]] and [[observables]], respectively, and where

$$
  g_{sw, n_1} \in C^\infty_c(\Sigma) \langle g\rangle
$$

and

$$
  j_{sw,n_2} \in C^\infty_c(\Sigma) \langle j \rangle
$$

are [[compact support|compactly supported]] [[smooth functions]]
([[bump functions]]) on spacetime $\Sigma$ times the [[coupling constant]] or source strength, respectively,
 to be regarded as [[adiabatic switching|adiabatically switched]]
[[coupling constant]] and [[source field]], respectively.

**(invertibility of the perturbative S-matrix)**

The mutliplicative inverse $S(-)^{-1}$ of the perturbative S-matrix in def. \ref{PerturbativeSMatrixOnMinkowskiSpacetime}
always exists: By the axioms "perturbation" and "normalization" this follows with the usual formula
for the multiplicative inverse of [[formal power series]] that are non-vanishing in degree 0:

If we write 

$$
  S(g L +  j A) \coloneqq 1 + D(g L + j A)
$$

then

$$
  \label{InfverseOfPerturbativeSMatrix}
  \begin{aligned}
    S(g L + j A)^{-1} &= (1 + D(j L + j A))^{-1}
    \\
    & =

    \\
    & = \underoverset{r = 0}{\infty}{\sum} (1 - S(g L + j A))^r
    \,,
  \end{aligned}
$$

where the last sum does exist in $\mathcal{W}[ [ g/\hbar, j/\hbar] ]$ because by _normalization_ 
$D(L)$ has vanishing coefficient zeroth order, so that
only a finite sub-sum of the formal infinite sum contributes in each order.

**(interpretation of the perturbative S-matrix)**

In def. \ref{PerturbativeSMatrixOnMinkowskiSpacetime} $g/\hbar$ has the interpretation of the
[[coupling constant]] divided by [[Planck's constant]]. One obtains a [[formal power series]]
with the expected non-negative powers of $\hbar$ after passing to the [[interacting field algebra]]
induced by the S-matrix.

The local density $g_{sw}L_{int}$ has the interpretation
[[interaction]] [[Lagrangian density]] $L_{int}$ [[adiabatic switching|adiabatically switched]] by a compactly supported
function $g_{sw}$,  and $J$ has the interpretation of a [[source field]].

###### Definition
**(notation for time-ordered products as [[generalized functions]])**

It will be convenient (as in [Epstein-Glaser 73](#EpsteinGlaser73)) to think of the time-ordered products, being [[operator-valued distributions]], as [[generalized functions]] with dependence on spacetime points:

$$
  \int_{\Sigma^{r+s}}
    T_{L_1, \cdots, L_r, A_1, \cdots, A_s}(x_1, \cdots, x_{r}, y_1, \cdots, y_s)
    g_{sw,1}(x_1) \cdots g_{sw, r}(x_r)    
    j_{sw,1}(y_1) \cdots j_{sw,s}(y_s)
  dvol_\Sigma(x,y)
  \;\coloneqq\;
  T( g_{sw,1} L_1 \cdots g_{sw,k} L \cdots j_{sw,1} A_1 \cdots j_{sw,s}A_s )  
  \,.
$$

Moreover, the subscripts on these [[generalized functions]] will always be 
clear from the context, so that in computations we will notationally suppress these.

Finally, due to the symmetry axiom in def. \ref{TimeOrderedProduct}, a time-ordered product
depends only on its [[set]] of arguments, not on the order of the arguments. We will write
$\mathbf{X} \coloneqq \{x_1, \cdots, x_r\}$ and $\mathbf{Y} \coloneqq \{y_1, \cdots y_r\}$
for sets of spacetime points, and hence abbreviate the expression for the "value" of the 
generalized function in the above as $T(\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{Y})$ etc.

###### Proposition
**([[time-ordered products]] induce perturbative S-matrix)**

If $\{T_k\}_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ is a system of [[time-ordered products]] according to def. \ref{TimeOrderedProduct},
then $S(-) \coloneqq T \exp(\tfrac{-g}{i \hbar}(-))$ is a perturbative S-matrix according to def. \ref{PerturbativeSMatrixOnMinkowskiSpacetime}.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof idea

The subtle point is to see that time-ordering implies causal additivity of the S-matrix.
To see this (following [Epstein-Glaser 73, around (73)](#EpsteinGlaser73)) first express the induced generating [[retarded product]] (def. \ref{RetardedProductFromPerturbativeSMatrix}) in terms of the given time-ordered product $T$ and 
its induced reverse-time ordered product (def. \ref{ReverseTimeOrderedProduct}). In the condensed notation of
def. \ref{NotationForTimeOrderedProductsAsGeneralizedFunctions} this 
yields at order $(g/\hbar)^{\vert \mathbf{Y}\vert} (j/\hbar)^{\vert \mathbf{X}\vert}$ the equation

$$
  R(\mathbf{Y}, \mathbf{X})
   \;=\;
  \underset{\mathbf{I} \subset \mathbf{Y}}{\sum} 
    (-1)^{\vert \mathbf{I}\vert}
    \overline{T}(\mathbf{I}) 
    T( (\mathbf{Y} \setminus \mathbf{I}) , \mathbf{X} )
  \,.
$$

We claim now that this implies that the [[support of a distribution|support]] of $R$ is inside the subset for which
$\mathbf{Y}$ is in the causal past of $\mathbf{X}$. This will imply the claim, because by
multi-linearity of $R(-,-)$ it then follows that 

$$
  \left(J_1 \geq J_2\right) \Rightarrow \left( V_{L + J_1}(J_2) = V_L(J_2) \right)
$$

and by lemma \ref{CausalLocalityOfThePerturbativeSMatrix} this is equivalent to causal additivity of the S-matrix.

To see the claim, consider $\marthbf{X}, \mathbf{Y} \subset \Sigma$ such that the subset $\mathbf{P} \subset \mathbf{Y}$
of points not in the past of $\mathbf{X}$, hence the maximal subset with

$$
  \mathbf{P} \geq \mathbf{X}
$$

is non-empty. 

Write $\mathbf{Q} \coloneqq \mathbf{Y} \setminus \mathbf{Q}$
for the complentary set of points which are in the past of $\mathbf{X}$.   It follows that also

$$
  \mathbf{P} \geq \mathbf{Q}
  \,.
$$

With this decomposition of $\mathbf{Y}$, the above sum over subsets of $\mathbf{Y}$ may be decomposed into two sums over
subsets $\mathbf{P}$ of $\mathbf{Q}$ and $\mathbf{K}$ $\mathbf{Q}$, respectively.
These subsets inherit the above causal ordering, so that the time-ordered and reverse time-ordered products
factor on these arguments:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    R(\mathbf{Y}, \mathbf{X})
    & = 
    \underset{ {\mathbf{J} \subset \mathbf{P}} \atop { \mathbf{K} \subset \mathbf{Q} } }{\sum}
     \,
     \overline{T}( \mathbf{J} \cup \mathbf{K} ) 
     T( (\mathbf{P} \setminus \mathbf{J}) \cup (\mathbf{Q} \setminus \mathbf{K}), \mathbf{X} )
     \\
     & =
     \underset{ {\mathbf{J} \subset \mathbf{P}} \atop { \mathbf{K} \subset \mathbf{Q} } }{\sum}
     \,
     \overline{T}( \mathbf{K} )
     \overline{T}( \mathbf{J} )
     T( \mathbf{P} \setminus \mathbf{J} )
     T( \mathbf{Q} \setminus \mathbf{K}, \mathbf{X} )
     \\
     & = 
     \underset{ \mathbf{K} \subset \mathbf{Q} }{\sum}
     \overline{T}(\mathbf{K})
     \underset{= 0}{
     \underbrace{
     \left(
       \underset{\mathbf{J} \subset \mathbf{P}}{\sum}
       \overline{T}(\mathbf{J})
       T( \mathbf{P} \setminus \mathbf{J} )
     \right)
     }}
     T(\mathbf{Q} \setminus \mathbf{K}, \mathbf{X}) 
  \end{aligned}  
  \,.
$$

Here the sub-sum in brackets vanishes, because by definition this is the integral kernel for
$S(L)^{-1} S(L) = 1$ at order $(g/\hbar)^{\vert \mathbf{P} \vert}$. But since ${\vert \mathbf{P}\vert } \geq 1$
by assumption, this is zero.

###### Definition
**(perturbative [[quantum observables]])**

Let $S$ be a perturbative S-matrix as in def. \ref{PerturbativeSMatrixOnMinkowskiSpacetime},
and $g_{sw} L_{int} \in \mathcal{F}_{loc}\langle g\rangle$ an [[adiabatic switching|adiabatically switchd]]
[[innteraction]] [[Lagrangian density]].

Then for $A \in \mathcal{F}_{loc}$ a, the perturbative
[[quantum observable]] $\widehat{A}$ corresponding to $A$ is the [[operator-valued distribution]]

$$
  \widehat{A}
  \;\colon\;
  C^\infty_c(\Sigma)
    \longrightarrow
  \mathcal{W}[ [ g ] ][ [ \hbar ] ]
$$

which is the [[derivative]] of the generating functional $Z$ (def. \ref{PerturbativeSMatrixOnMinkowskiSpacetime}) at vanishing [[source field]]:

$$
  \widehat{A}(h)

  - i \hbar \frac{d}{d j} Z_{g_{sw} L_{int}}( j h A)\vert_{j = 0}
  \,.
$$

This definition of $\widehat{A}$ without the [[adiabatic switching]] $g_{sw}$ is originally due to [Bogoliubov-Shirkov 59](#BogoliubovShirkov59), nowadays sometimes called _[[Bogoliubov's formula]]_ (e.g. [Rejzner 16 (6.12)](#Rejzner16)).
The version with adiabatic switching is due to ([Epstein-Glaser 73 around (74)](#EpsteinGlaser73)).

**([[retarded products]] induced from perturbative S-matrix)

It follows from the perturbation axiom in def. \ref{PerturbativeSMatrixOnMinkowskiSpacetime} that there is a system of [[continuous linear functionals]]

These are called the (generating) _[[retarded products]]_ ([Glaser-Lehmann-Zimmermann 57](#GlaserLehmannZimmermann57), [Epstein-Glaser 73, section 8.1](#EpsteinGlaser73)).

=--

Direct axiomatization of the retarded products is due to ([Dütsch-Fredenhagen 04](#DuetschFredenhagen04)),
see ([Collini 16, section 2.2](#Collini16)).


#### Existence and (re-)normalization

The [[main theorem of perturbative renormalization]] states that

1. An adiabatically switched perturbative S-matrix according to the axioms in def. \ref{PerturbativeSMatrixOnMinkowskiSpacetime}
   exists.

1. For fixed $L_{int}$, it is non-unique up to a finite-dimensional space of choices for each order of $g/\hbar$
   which correspond to the [[renormalization]] freedom ([Epstein-Glaser 73](#EpsteinGlaser73)).

1. There is a way to make these choices coherently, so that
   one obtains the $S$-matrix indeed as a function in $L_{int}$. (a "renormalization scheme").

1. The perturbative S-matrices $S$ and $\tilde S$ for two different such renormalization schemes are
   related by a transformation $Z \;\colon\; \mathcal{F}_{loc} \longrightarrow \mathcal{F}_{loc}$ as

   $$
     \tilde S = S \circ Z
     \,.
   $$

   here $Z(L_{int})$ is $L_{int}$ with "counterterms added".

1. The transformations $Z \colon \mathcal{T}_{loc} \to \mathcal{T}_{loc}$ form a [[group]], called the
   _[[Stückelberg-Peterson renormalization group]]_. Hence the renormalization schemes / coherent perturbative
   S-matrices form a [[torsor]] over this group.






#### Causal locality and Local net of quantum observables
 {#CausalLocality}


The key consequence of the "causal additivity axiom" on the S-matrix in def. \ref{PerturbativeSMatrixOnMinkowskiSpacetime}
is that the perturbative [[quantum observables]] with bounded spacetime support (def. \ref{GeneratingFunctionsForCorrelationFunctions})

1. depend on the [[adiabatic switching]] $g_{sw}$ of the [[interaction]] [[Lagrangian density]]
only up to _canonical_ unitary [[isomorphism]] (lemma \ref{CausalLocalityOfThePerturbativeSMatrix} below)

1. form a [[causal locality|causally]] [[local net of observables]] in the sense of the [[Haag-Kastler axioms]] as the spacetime localization varies (prop. \ref{PerturbativeQuantumObservablesIsLocalnet} below).

To the extent that a [[local net of observables]] may be regarded as _defining_ a [[quantum field theory]],
which is the claim of ([[perturbative AQFT|perturbative]] [[AQFT]]),
this proves that the perturbative S-matrices in [[causal perturbation theory]] as in def. \ref{PerturbativeSMatrixOnMinkowskiSpacetime}
indeed makes sense, despite the involvement of [[adiabatic switching]] of the [[interaction]] [[Lagrangian density]]
which does not make physical sense when interpreted naively: In reality the interaction is of course not (for realistic [[theory (physics)|theories]] at least) "switched off" outside some bounded region of spacetime; but the result here shows that if we pretend that it does
then first of all we get a consistent mathematical formulas and moreover we can then nevertheless compute the correct [[quantum observables]] that are localized in this spacetime region. But the [[local net of observables]] as the spacetime localization varies
is supposed to encode the full quantum field theory. Certainly any given [[experiment]] in practice probes a bounded spacetime
region, and hence the algebra of observables localized in this region is sufficient to compare the theory to experiment.





+-- {: .num_lemma #CausalLocalityOfThePerturbativeSMatrix}
###### Lemma
**(causal locality of the perturbative S-matrix)**

Let $S$ be a perturbative S-matrix according to def. \ref{PerturbativeSMatrixOnMinkowskiSpacetime}
with $Z$ the generating functional it induces

1. The following conditions are equivalent for all $L, J_1, J_2 \in \mathcal{F}_{loc}$:

   1. $Z_L(J_1 + J_2) = Z_L(J_1) Z_L(J_2)$

   1. $Z_{L + J_1}(J_2) = Z_L(J_2)$

   1. $S(L + J_1 + J_2) = S(L, J_1) S(L)^{-1} S(L + J_2)$

   Hence causal additivity in def. \ref{PerturbativeSMatrixOnMinkowskiSpacetime}
implies that all these conditions hold if $supp(J_1) \geq supp(J_2)$.


1. If $supp(J_1) \geq supp(J_2)$ and $supp(J_2) \geq supp(J_1)$ then

   $$
     Z_{L_{int}}(J_1) Z_{L_{int}}(J_2) = Z_{L_{int}}(J_2) J_{L_{int}}(J_1)
     \,.
   $$


   Similarly, if $supp(L_1) \geq supp(L_2)$ and $supp(L_2) \geq supp(L_1)$ then

   $$
     S(L_1) S(L_2) = S(L_2) S(L_1)
     \,.
   $$



1. If $L_1\vert_{O} = L_2\vert_{O}$ on a [[causally closed subset]] $O \subset \mathbb{R}^{d-1,1}$
then there exists an invertible $K \in \mathcal{W}[ [ g/\hbar] ]$ such that for all $J$ with $supp(J) \subset O$

   $$
     V(L_2, J) = K^{-1} V(L_1, J) K
     \,.
   $$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The equivalence of the three conditions in the first statement is immediate from the definitions:

Expanding out the definition of $V$, the first expression is equivalent to

$$
  S(L)^{-1} S(L + J_1 + J_2)
    =
  S(L)^{-1} S(L +  J_1 ) S(L)^{-1} S(L + J_2)
  \,.
$$

Multiplying both sides of this equation by $S(L)$, shows that it is equivalent to the third clause.

Multiplying once more with $S(L + J_1)^{-1}$ this third equation is seen to be equivalent to

$$
  S(L + J_1)^{-1} S(L + J_1 + J_2) = S(L)^{-1} S(L + J_2)
$$

which is equivalently the second clause, by definition of $V$.

Now the first clause of the first item immediately implies the first clause of the second item.

Similarly, setting $L = 0$ and $J_1 = L_1$ and $J_2 = L_2$ in the third clause of the first item it
reduces to

$$
  \left(
    supp(L_1) \geq supp(L_2)
  \right)
   \;\Rightarrow\;
  S(L_1 + L_2)
  =
  S(L_1)S(L_2)
  \,.
$$

Hence if $supp(L_1) \geq supp(L_2)$ and $supp(L_2) \geq supp(L_1)$ then

$$
  S(L_1) S(L_2) = S(L_1 + L_2) = S(L_2 + L_1) = S(L_2) S(L_1)
  \,,
$$

which is the second clause of the second statement to be shown.


For the last statement, notice that by causal closure of
$O$ the difference $L_2 - L_2$, which by assumption has
$supp(L_2 - L_1) \in \mathbb{R}^{d-1,1} \setminus O$,
may be written as

$$
  L_2 - L_1 = a + r
$$

such that

$$
  supp(a) \geq supp(J) \geq supp(r)
$$

It follows with causal additivity and its equivalent formulations above that

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    V(L_2, J)
      & =
    V(L_1 + a + r, J)
    \\
      & =
    V(L_1 + r , J)
    \\
      & =
    S(L_1 + r)^{-1} S(L_1 + r + J)
    \\
      & =
    S(L_1 + r)^{-1} S(J + L_1) S(L_1)^{-1} S(L_1 + r)
    \\
      & =
    S(L_1 + r)^{-1} \underset{= id}{\underbrace{S(L_1) S(L_1)^{-1}}} S(L_1 + J) S(L_1)^{-1} S(L_1 + r)
    \\
      & =
    V(L_1, r)^{-1} \, V(L_1, J) \, V(L_1,r)
  \end{aligned}
$$

and hence the last statement holds for $K \coloneqq V(L_1,r)$.

By lemma \ref{CausalLocalityOfThePerturbativeSMatrix},
for every causally closed $\mathcal{O} \subset X$ and every $g_{sw} \in Cutoffs(\mathcal{O})$
the abstract algebra $Gen_{L_{int}}(\mathcal{O})$ from def. \ref{CausalLocalityOfThePerturbativeSMatrix}

of formal power series in the [[Wick algebra]].

Beware the slight subtlety in this statement:

The unitary elements $K$ in $\mathcal{W}[ [ g/\hbar] ]$ which exhibit the isomorphisms are not
unique, since there are many choices of splittings $g_2 - g_1 = a + r$ in the proof of prop. \ref{CausalLocalityOfThePerturbativeSMatrix}).
But the induced isomorphisms between the algebras generated by the $Z_{L_{int}}(J)$ is independent
of this ambiguity, since, again by the proof of prop. \ref{CausalLocalityOfThePerturbativeSMatrix},
conjugation by each such $K$ gives the same result on the given generators: $Z_{g_1 L_{int}}(J) \mapsto Z_{g_2 L_{int}}(J)$.

###### Proof

Isotony is immediate from the definition of the algebra homomorphisms in def. \ref{PerturbativeGeneratingLocalNetOfObservables}.

Causal locality of the system of observables follows from the causal additivity of the S-matrix,
by the first clause in the second statement of lemma \ref{CausalLocalityOfThePerturbativeSMatrix}.

=--

In the same kind of way as def. \ref{PerturbativeGeneratingLocalNetOfObservables} the actual net of algebra
of perturbative [[quantum observables]] (def. \ref{GeneratingFunctionsForCorrelationFunctions}) is defined:

+-- {: .num_defn #SystemOfAlgebrasOfQuantumObservables}
###### Definition
**(system of [[algebras of quantum observables]])

Let $S$ be a perturbative S-matrix according to def. \ref{PerturbativeSMatrixOnMinkowskiSpacetime}
and let $L{int} \in \Omega^{d,0}(E)$ be an [[interaction]] [[Lagrangian density]].


For $g_{sw} \in Cutoffs(S)$ (def. \ref{CutoffFunctions}) let

$$
  Obs_{g_{sw} L_{int}}(\mathcal{O})
   \coloneqq
  \langle -i \hbar\frac{d}{d \epsilon} V(g_{sw}L_{int}, \epsilon J)\vert_{\epsilon = 0} \;\vert\; supp(J) \subset \mathcal{O} \rangle
   \subset
  \mathcal{W}[ [ g ] ] [ [ \hbar ]  ]
$$

be the smallest subalgebra of the [[Wick algebra]] which contains the
perturbative quantum observables  (def. \ref{GeneratingFunctionsForCorrelationFunctions}) supported in $\mathcal{O}$.

Moreover, let

$$
  Obs_{L_{int}}(\mathcal{O})
    \subset
  \underset{g_{sw} \in Cutoffs(\mathcal{O})}{\prod} Obs_{g_{sw}L_{int}}(\mathcal{O})
$$

be the subalgebra of the [[Cartesian product]] of all these algebras as $g_{sw}$ ranges, which is generated by the
[[tuples]]

$$
  -i \hbar \frac{d}{d \epsilon} Z_{L_{int}}(\epsilon J)\vert_{\epsilon = 0}
    \coloneqq
  ( - i \hbar \frac{d}{d \epsilon} Z_{g_{sw}L_{int}} (\epsilon J)\vert_{\epsilon = 0} )_{g_{sw} \in Cutoffs(\mathcal{O})}
$$

for $J$ with $supp(J) \subset \mathcal{O}$.

(These algebras of observables of perturbatively interacting field theory are often referred to as the
"interacting field algebras", even though its really an algebra of quantum observables on a configuration of interacting fields.)

Finally, for $\mathcal{O}_1 \subset \mathcal{O}_2$ an inclusion of two [[causally closed subsets]], let

$$
  i_{\mathcal{O}_1, \mathcal{O}_2}
  \;\colon\;
  Obs_{L_{int}}(\mathcal{O}_1)
    \longrightarrow
  Obs_{L_{int}}(\mathcal{O}_2)
$$

be the algebra homomorphism which is given simply by restricting the index set of [[tuples]].

This construction defines a [[functor]]

$$
  Obs_{L_{int}} \;\colon\; CausClsdSubsets(X) \longrightarrow StarAlgebras
  \,.
$$

=--

As a corollary of prop. \ref{GeneratingAlgebrasIsLocalNet} we then have the key result:

+-- {: .num_prop #PerturbativeQuantumObservablesIsLocalnet}
###### Proposition
**(system of algebras of perturbative quantum observables is [[local net of observables]])**


Given a perturbative S-matrix according to def. \ref{PerturbativeSMatrixOnMinkowskiSpacetime}
and an interaction [[Lagrangian density]] $L_{int}$, then the system of [[algebras of observables]] $Obs_{L_{int}}$ (def. \ref{SystemOfAlgebrasOfQuantumObservables})
is a [[local net of observables]] in that

1. (isotony) For every inclusion $\mathcal{O}_1 \subset \mathcal{O}_2$ of [[causally closed subsets]]
   the corresponding algebra homomorphism is a [[monomorphism]]

   $$
     i_{\mathcal{O}_1, \mathcal{O}_2} \colon Obs_{L_{int}}(\mathcal{O}_1)
     \;\colon\;
     Obs_{L_{int}}(\mathcal{O}_1) \hookrightarrow Obs_{L_{int}}(\mathcal{O}_2)
   $$

1. ([[causal locality]]) For $\mathcal{O}_1, \mathcal{O}_2 \subset X$ two [[causally closed subsets]]
   which are [[spacelike]] separated, in that

   $$
     \mathcal{O}_1 \geq \mathcal{O}_2
       \;\text{and}\;
     \mathcal{O}_2 \geq \mathcal{O}_1
   $$

   then for $\mathcal{O} \subset X$ any further causally closed subset which contains both

   $$
     \mathcal{O}_1 , \mathcal{O}_2 \subset \mathcal{O}
   $$

   then the corresponding images of the generating algebras of $\mathcal{O}_1$ and $\mathcal{O}_2$,
   respectively, commute with each other as subalgebras of the generating algebra of $\mathcal{O}$:

   $$
     \left[
       i_{\mathcal{O}_1,\mathcal{O}}(Obs_{L_{int}}(\mathcal{O}_1))
       \;,\;
       i_{\mathcal{O}_2,\mathcal{O}}(Obs_{L_{int}}(\mathcal{O}_2))
     \right]
     \;=\;
     0
     \;\;\;
     \in Obs_{L_{int}}(\mathcal{O})
     \,.
   $$

###### Proof

The first point is again immediate from the definition (def. \ref{SystemOfAlgebrasOfQuantumObservables}).

For the second point it is sufficient to check the commutativity relation on generators. For these
the statement follows with prop. \ref{GeneratingAlgebrasIsLocalNet}:

$$

      -i\hbar \frac{d}{d \epsilon_1} Z_{g_{sw}L_{int}}(\epsilon_1 J_1)\vert_{\epsilon_1 = 0}

    \right]}} \vert_{ {\epsilon_1 = 0} \atop {\epsilon_2 = 0}}
    \\

### In functorial quantum field theory

At least the _idea_ of the S-matrix is very explicit in the Atiyah-Segal picture of _functorial QFT_ ([[FQFT]]).

Here a quantum field theory is given by a [[functor]]

$$
 Z \colon Bord_d^S \longrightarrow Vect
$$

from a suitable [[category of cobordisms]] to a suitable [[category]] of [[vector spaces]].

* To a codimension-1 slice $M_{d-1}$ of space this assigns a vector space $Z(M_{d-1})$ -- the (Hilbert) [[space of quantum states]] over $M_{d-1}$;

* to a [[spacetime]]/[[worldvolume]] manifold $M$ with [[boundaries]] $\partial M$ one assigns the quantum propagator which is the linear map $Z(M) : Z(\partial_{in} M) \to Z(\partial_{out} M)$ that takes incoming states to outgoing states via propagation along the spacetime/worldvolume $M$. This $Z(M)$ is alternatively known as the  the _[[scattering amplitude]]_ or _S-matrix_ for propagation from $\partial_{in}M$ to $\partial_{out}M$ along a process of shape $M$.

Now for genuine [[topological field theories]] all spaces of quantum states are [[finite number|finite]] [[dimension|dimensional]] and hence we can equivalently consider the [[dual vector space]] (using that finite dimensional vector spaces form a [[compact closed category]]). Doing so the propagator map

$$
  Z(M) : Z(\partial_{in}M) \to Z(\partial_{out}M)
$$

equivalently becomes a linear map of the form

$$
  \mathbb{C} \to Z(\partial_{out}M) \otimes Z(\partial_{in}M)^\ast = Z(\partial M)
  \,.
$$

Notice that such a linear map from the canonical 1-dimensional complex vector space $\mathbb{C}$ to some other vector space is equivalently just a choice of element in that vector space. It is in this sense that $Z(M)$ is equivalently a vector in $Z(\partial_{out}M) \otimes Z(\partial_{in}M)^\ast = Z(\partial M)$.

In this form in physics the propagator is usually called the _[[correlator]]_ or _[[n-point function]]_ .

Segal's axioms for [[FQFT]] ([[CFT]] in his case) were originally explicitly about the propagators/S-matrices, while Atiyah formulated it in terms of the correlators this way. Both perspectives go over into each other under duality as above.

Notice that this kind of discussion is not restricted to topological field theory. For instance already plain quantum mechanics is usefully formulated this way, that's the point of [[finite quantum mechanics in terms of dagger-compact categories]].

## History
 {#History}


In the 1960s there was a prominent proposal, around [[Geoffrey Chew]], that ([[perturbative quantum field theory|perturbative]]) [[quantum field theory]] should be _defined_ by [[axiom|axiomatizing]] properties of the S-matrix. This is a radical perspective where no [[spacetime]] geometry and physical fields are made explicit, but where the entire physics is encoded by what quantum particles see that scatter through it.

Historically, the S-matrix "bootstrap" approach fell out of fashion with the success of the [[quark]] model and of [[QCD]], which is a [[local field theory]] governed by an [[action functional]] ([[Yang-Mills theory]]).

But later [[perturbative string theory]] revived the S-matrix approach. In general, perturbative string theory is not defined by a geometric background. Instead the background is algebraically encoded by a [[2d SCFT]] ("[[2-spectral triple]]") and the [[string perturbation series]] is a formula that translates this into an S-matrix. Spacetime physics then is whatever is seen by string scattering processes (see also at _[string theory FAQ -- What are the equations of string theory?](string%20theory%20FAQ#WhatAreTheEquations)_)

More recently, the S-matrix perspective becomes fashionable also in [[Yang-Mills theory]], at least in [[super Yang-Mills theory]]: one observes that the theory enjoyes good structures in its scattering amplitudes which are
essentially invisible in the vast summation of [[Feynman diagrams]] that extract the S-matrix from the [[action functional]]. Instead there are entirely different mathematical structures that encode at least some sub-class of scattering amplitudes (see at _[[amplituhedron]]_).

From [this physics.SE comment](http://physics.stackexchange.com/a/15164/5603) by [[Ron Maimon]]:

> The history of [[physics]] cannot be well understood without appreciating the unbelievable antagonism between the [[Geoffrey Chew|Chew]]/[[Stanley Mandelstam|Mandelstam]]/[[Vladimir Gribov|Gribov]] S-matrix camp, and the [[Steven Weinberg|Weinberg]]/[[Sheldon Glashow|Glashow]]/[[Alexander Polyakov|Polyakov]] [[quantum field theory|Field theory]] camp. The two sides hated each other, did not hire each other, and did not read each other, at least not in the west. The only people that straddled both camps were older folks and Russians--- [[Murray Gell-Mann|Gell-Mann]] more than [[Lev Landau|Landau]] (who believed the [[Landau pole]] implied S-matrix), Gribov and Migdal more than anyone else in the west other than [[Murray Gell-Mann|Gell-Mann]] and [[Kenneth Wilson|Wilson]]. Wilson did his PhD in S-matrix theory, for example, as did [[David Gross]] (under Chew).

> In the 1970s, S-matrix theory just plain died. All practitioners jumped ship rapidly in 1974, with the triple-whammy of [[effective field theory|Wilsonian field theory]], the discovery of the Charm [[quark]], and [[asymptotic freedom]]. These results killed S-matrix theory for thirty years. Those that jumped ship include all the original [[string theory|string theorists]] who stayed employed: notably [[Gabriele Veneziano|Veneziano]], who was convinced that [[gauge theory]] was right when [[Gerard ’t Hooft|t'Hooft]] showed that [[AdS-CFT|large-N gauge fields]] give the string topological expansion, and [[Leonard Susskind|Susskind]], who didn't mention Regge theory after the early 1970s. Everybody stopped studying [[string theory]] except [[Joël Scherk|Scherk]] and [[John Schwarz|Schwarz]], and Schwarz was protected by
[[Murray Gell-Mann|Gell-Mann]], or else he would never have been tenured and funded.

> This sorry history means that not a single S-matrix theory course is taught in the curriculum today, nobody studies it except a few theorists of advanced age hidden away in particle accelerators, and the main S-matrix theory, [[string theory]], is not properly explained and remains completely enigmatic even to most physicists. There were some good reasons for this --- some S-matrix people said silly things about the consistency of quantum field theory --- but to be fair, [[quantum field theory]] people said equally silly things about S-matrix theory.

> [[Steven Weinberg|Weinberg]] came up with these heuristic arguments in the 1960s, which convinced him that S-matrix theory was a dead end, or rather, to show that it was a tautological synonym for quantum field theory. Weinberg was motivated by models of pion-nucleon interactions, which was a hot S-matrix topic in the early 1960s. The solution to the problem is the [[chiral symmetry breaking]] models of the pion condensate, and these are [[effective field theories]].

> Building on this result, Weinberg became convinced that the only real solution to the S-matrix was a field theory of some particles with spin. He still says this every once in a while, but it is dead wrong. The most charitable interpretation is that every S-matrix has a field theory limit, where all but a finite number of particles decouple, but this is not true either (consider [[little string theory]]). String theory exists, and there are non-field theoretic S-matrices, namely all the ones in [[string theory]], including [[little string theory]] in (5+1)d, which is non-gravitational.

From ([Weinberg 09, p. 11](#Weinberg09)):

> I offered this in my 1979 paper as what Arthur Wightman would call a [[folk theorem]]: "if one writes down the most general possible [[Lagrangian]], including all terms consistent with assumed [[symmetry]] principles, and then calculates [[scattering amplitudes|matrix elements]] with this Lagrangian to any given order of [[perturbation theory]], the result will simply be the most general possible S-matrix consistent with perturbative unitarity, analyticity, [[cluster decomposition]], and the assumed symmetry properties."

> There was an interesting irony in this. I had been at Berkeley from 1959 to 1966, when [[Geoffrey Chew]] and his collaborators were elaborating a program for calculating S-matrix elements for strong interaction processes by the use of unitarity, analyticity, and Lorentz invariance, without reference to [[quantum field theory]]. I found it an attractive philosophy, because it relied only on a minimum of principles, all well established. Unfortunately, the S-matrix theorists were never able to develop a reliable method of calculation, so I worked instead on other things, including [[current algebra]]. Now in 1979 I realized that the assumptions of S-matrix theory, supplemented by chiral invariance, were indeed all that are needed at low energy, but the most convenient way of implementing these assumptions in actual calculations was by good old quantum field theory, which the S-matrix theorists had hoped to supplant.
