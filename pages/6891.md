## Definition

For $X$ a [[compact space|compact]], [[connected]], [[orientation|oriented]] 3-[[dimension]]al [[manifold]], write 

$$
  2 T X := T X \oplus T X
$$

for the fiberwise [[direct sum]] of the [[tangent bundle]] with itself. Via the [[diagonal]] embedding

$$
  SO(3) \to SO(3) \times SO(3) \hookrightarrow SO(6)
$$

this naturally induces a [[special orthogonal group|SO(6)]]-[[principal bundle]]. Due to the low dimension, this always lifts to a [[spin group|spin(6)]]-[[principal bundle]].

A **2-framing** on $X$ is a [[homotopy]] class of trivializations of this Spin-bundle.

This can be reformulated ([Douglas, Schommer-Pries, Snyder](#DSPS)) in terms of  
$p_1$-[[twisted differential c-structures|structure]], where $p_1$ is the first [[Pontryagin class]]

$$
  p_1\colon B SO(3) \to K(\mathbb{Z},4)
  \,.
$$

The idea is originally due to

in the context of [[Chern-Simons theory]]. The term "2-framing" for this concept was then introduced in
