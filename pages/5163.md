## Definition

A **constant stack** is a section of a constant 2-stack.

## Pattern

* A [[locally constant function]] is a section of a [[constant sheaf]];

* a [[locally constant sheaf]] is a section of a [[constant stack]];

* a **locally constant stack** is a section of (... and so on...)

* a [[locally constant ∞-stack]] is a section of a [[constant ∞-stack]].

A locally constant sheaf / $\infty$-stack is also called a [[local system]].
