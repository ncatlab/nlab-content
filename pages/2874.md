_Theory and Applications of Categories_ (or just _TAC_) is an online journal about [[category theory]].  In addition to new material, they also make available important classics that have been hard to find.

The website is <http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/>, from which you have access to all articles in all issues.  Note that `http://www.tac.mta.ca/` does *not* work.

Controversies: _TAC_ is a high-quality journal with an impressive [editorial board](http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/geninfo.html#edlist), but unfortunately it is not listed on commercial lists of prestigious journals like the "Science Citation Index" and "Current Contents"; we should fight to improve this. Unfortunately, also the citations from _TAC_ are not yet counted on MathSciNet either, due to the unpopularity of category theory in the leadership of the AMS (see [nForum discussion](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Mathforge/nForum/comments.php?DiscussionID=1927)). Another pure category journal is [[Cahiers]].
