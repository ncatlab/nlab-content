## Idea

As for [[localization]] of ordinary [[categories]], there are slightly different notions of what a localization of an [[(∞,1)-category]] is.

One definition is in terms of [[reflective (∞,1)-subcategories]]:

A _[[localization]]_ , in this sense, of an [[(∞,1)-category]] $C$ is a functor $L : C \to C_0$ to an $(\infty,1)$-subcategory $C_0 \hookrightarrow C$ such that with $c$ any object there is a morphism connecting it to its localization 

$$
  c \to L(c)
$$

in a suitable way. This "suitable way" just says that 
$f$ is left adjoint to the fully faithful inclusion functor.


Since localizations are entirely determined by which morphisms in $C$ are sent to equivalences in $C_0$, they can be thought of as sending $C$ to the result of "inverting" all these morphisms, a process familiar from forming the [[homotopy category]] of a [[homotopical category]].

###### Definition

An [[(∞,1)-functor]] $L : C \to C_0$ is called a **localization** of the [[(∞,1)-category]] $C$ if it has a right [[adjoint (∞,1)-functor]] $i : C_0 \hookrightarrow C$ that is [[full and faithful (∞,1)-functor|full and faithful]].

$$
  (L \dashv i) : C_0 \stackrel{\overset{L}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{i}{\hookrightarrow}}
  C
  \,.
$$

In other words: $L$ is a localization if it is the **reflector** of a [[reflective (∞,1)-subcategory]] $C_0 \hookrightarrow C$.

This is [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, def. 5.2.7.2]].


## Examples

* Locaizations of $(\infty,1)$-categories are modeled by the notion of left [[Bousfield localization of model categories]]. 

  One precise statement is: localizations of [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-presheaves]] $C = PSh_{(\infty,1)}(K)$ are [[presentable (∞,1)-category|presented]] by the left Bousfield localizations of the global projectibe [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] on the [[simplicial category]] incarnation of $K$.

* [[∞-stackification]] is the localization of an [[(∞,1)-category]] of [[(∞,1)-presheaves]] to the $(\infty,1)$-subcategory [[(infinity,1)-category of (infinity,1)-sheaves|of (∞,1)-sheaves]].
