###### Definition

A (possibly) [[large site]] is a **small-generated site** if it has a [[small category|small]] [[dense sub-site]].

=--

+-- {: .un_remark}
###### Remark

In ([Johnstone, p. 548](#Johnstone)) this is called an **essentially small site**. But notice that the underlying [[category]] of such need not be an [[essentially small category]].

## Examples

* The category of [[paracompact manifold]]s with its standard [[open cover]] [[coverage]] is a [[large site]] that is small-generated: a dense sub-site is [[CartSp]]${}_{top}$.

* Similarly the category [[Diff]] of smooth manifolds with the [[open cover]] [[coverage]] is a [[large site]] that is small-generated: a dense sub-site is [[CartSp]]${}_{smooth}$.
