## Idea

In [[Lagrangian field theory]] the _Dickey bracket_ is a canonical [[Lie bracket]] on [[conserved currents]]. Under the relation between conserved currents and [[infinitesimal symmetries of the Lagrangian]] the Dickey bracket lifts the canonical Lie bracket on [[infinitesimal symmetries]] to their associated conserved currents ([[Noether's theorem]]), exhibiting a [[Lie algebra extension]].
