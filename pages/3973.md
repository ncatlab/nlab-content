## Idea

A notion of _$n$-vector space_ is a [[categorification]] of the notion of [[vector space]].

There are various different notions of $n$-vector spaces. 

One notion is: an $n$-vector space is a [[chain complex]] of [[vector space]]s in degrees 0 to $n$. For $n=2$ this is a [[Baez-Crans 2-vector space]]. This is useful for lots of things, but tends to be too restrictive in other contexts.

Another is, recursively: an $(n-1)$-algebra object (or its $(n-1)$-category of modules) in the $n$-category of $(n-1)$-bimodules. For higher $n$ this is mentioned towards the end of [[Topological Quantum Field Theories from Compact Lie Groups]].

For $n=2$ this subsumes various definitions of [[2-vector space]] that are in the literature, such as notably the notion of [[Kapranov-Voevodsky 2-vector space]].
