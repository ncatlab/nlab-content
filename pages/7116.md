## Terminology

In [[field]] theory, what we call an 'absolute value' here is often called a 'valuation'.  However, there is also a more general notion of [[valuation]] used in field theory, which is what we call 'valuation'.  The notion of absolute value is also used in [[functional analysis]], where it may be called a 'multiplicative norm' (rather than merely submultiplicative, as norms on [[Banach algebras]] are required to be).


## Definition

For $k$ a [[rig]] (typically either a [[field]] or at least an [[integral domain]], or else an [[associative algebra]] over such), an **absolute value** on $k$ is a (non-trivial) multiplicative [[seminorm]], or equivalently a finite real-valued [[valuation]].

This means it is a [[function]] 

$$
  {\vert - \vert}\colon k \to \mathbb{R}
$$ 

to the [[real numbers]] such that for all $x, y \in k$

1. ${\vert x \vert} \geq 0$;

2. ${\vert x \vert} = 0$ precisely if $x = 0$;

3. ${\vert x \cdot y\vert} = {\vert x \vert} {\vert y \vert}$;

4. ${\vert x + y\vert} \leq {\vert x \vert} + {\vert y \vert}$ (the [[triangle inequality]]).


If the last triangle inequality is strengthened to

* ${\vert x + y\vert} \leq max({\vert x \vert}, {\vert y \vert})$ 

then ${\vert -\vert}$ is called an [[ultrametric]] or **non-archimedean** absolute value. Otherwise it is called **archimedean**.

Two absolute values ${\vert - \vert}_1$ and ${\vert - \vert}_2$ are called _equivalent_ if for all $x \in k$

$$
  ({\vert x \vert}_1 \lt 1)
   \Leftrightarrow
  ({\vert x \vert}_2 \lt 1)
  \,.
$$  

An [[equivalence class]] of absolute values is also called a **[[place]]**. 

A [[field]] equipped with an absolute value which is a [[complete metric space]] with respect to the corresponding [[metric]] is called a [[complete field]].


## Examples

### Trivial absolute value

Every field admits the trivial absolute value ${\vert- \vert}_0$ defined by

$$
  {\vert x \vert}_0 = 
  \left\{
    \array{
       0 & if\; x = 0
       \\
       1 & otherwise
    }
  \right.
  \,.
$$

This is non-archimedean.


### On the real and complex numbers
 {#OnTheRealAndComplexNumbers}

The standard absolute value ${\vert -\vert}_\infty$ on the [[real numbers]] is

$$
  {\vert x \vert}_{\infty} = 
  \sqrt{x^2}
  = 
  \left\{
    \array{
       x & if x \geq 0
       \\  
       - x & otherwise
    }
  \right.
  \,.
$$

The standard absolute value on the [[complex numbers]] is 

$$
  {\vert x + i y \vert}
  = 
  \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
  \,.
$$

These standard absolute values are archimedean, and with respect to these standard absolute values, both $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{C}$ are [[complete field|complete]] and hence are complete [[archimedean valued fields]]. Notice that $\mathbb{R}$ is in addition an [[ordered field]] and as such also an [[archimedean field]].


### On the rational numbers

The standard absolute value [above](#OnTheRealAndComplexNumbers) restricts to the standard absolute value on the [[rational numbers]]

$$
  {\vert -\vert}_\infty\colon \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}
  \,.
$$

Moreover, for any [[prime number]] $p$ there is a (class of an) absolute value ${\vert -\vert}_p$ on $\mathbb{Q}$ defined by

$$
  {\vert \frac{k}{l} p^n\vert}_p
  = 
  \epsilon^n
$$

for any $0 \lt \epsilon \lt 1$ and where $\frac{k}{l}p^n$ is the unique such decomposition of a given rational number with $k, l \in \matrhbb{Z}$ not divisible by $p$.

This is called the **$p$-adic** absolute value. It is non-archimedean. The [[complete field|completion]] $\mathbb{Q}_p$ of $\mathbb{Q}$ by this is called the field of [[p-adic numbers]], which is therefore a [[non-archimedean field]].

[[Ostrowski's theorem]] says that this exhaust the non-trivial absolute values on the [[rational numbers]]. Therefore the [[real numbers]] and the [[p-adic numbers]] are the only possible completions of $\mathbb{Q}$.


### On Laurent power series

The field of [[Laurent series]] $k[ [ T] ]$ over a [[field]] $k$ is a [[complete field]] with respect to the absolute value that sends a series to $\epsilon^n$ for a fixed $0 \lt \epsilon \lt 1$ and with $n$ the lowest integer such that the $n$th coefficient of the series is not $0$.
