## Idea

A _quasi-isomorphism_ is a [[chain map]] that induces [[isomorphisms]] on all [[homology groups]]. These are the natural choice of [[weak equivalences]] between [[chain complexes]] in the context of ([[stable homotopy theory|stable]]) [[homotopy theory]]. 

The [[localization]] of a [[category of chain complexes]] at the quasi-isomorphisms is called the _[[derived category]]_ of the underlying [[abelian category]]. 

Under the relation between [[topological spaces]] and [[chain complexes]] established by forming [[singular simplicial complexes]], quasi-isomorphism can be understod as the [[abelianization]] of [[weak homotopy equivalences]] (see the [[Hurewicz theorem]] for more on this).

## Definition

Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an [[abelian category]] and write 
$Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A})$ for its [[category of chain complexes]].

###### Definition

A [[chain map]] $f_\bullet : C_\bullet \to D_\bullet$ in $Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A})$ is called a  **quasi-isomorphism** if for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the induced morphisms on [[chain homology]] groups

$$
  H_n(f) \colon H_n(C) \to H_n(D)
$$

is an [[isomorphism]].

###### Remark

Quasi-isomorphisms are also called, more descriptively, **homology isomorphisms** or **$H_\bullet$-isomorphisms**.  See at _[[homology localization]]_ for more on this.

## Properties

### Relation to chain homology type

+-- {: .num_prop #ReflexiveAndTransitiveButNotSymmetric}
###### Proposition

The [[relation]] "There exists a quasi-isomorphism from $C_\bullet$ to $D_\bullet$." is a [[reflexive relation|reflexive]] and [[transitive relation]], but it is not a [[symmetric relation]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Reflexivity and transitivity are evident. An explicit counter-example 
showing the non-symmetry is the [[chain map]]

$$
  \array{
     \cdots &\to& 0 &\to& \mathbb{Z} &\stackrel{\cdot 2}{\to}& \mathbb{Z} &\to& 0 &\to& \cdots
     \\
     \cdots && \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow && \cdots
     \\
     \cdots &\to& 0 &\to& 0 &\to& \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} &\to& 0 &\to& \cdots
  }
  \,.
$$

This clearly induces an isomorphism on all homology groups. But there is not even a non-zero chain map in the other direction, since there is no non-zero group homomorphism $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}$.

###### Remark

This is as for [[weak homotopy equivalences]], see the discussion at _[Relation to homotopy types](weak+homotopy+equivalence#RelationToHomotopyTypes)_ there.

## In homotopy theory

Quasi-isomorphisms are the [[weak equivalences]] in the most common [[model category|model category structures]] on the [[category of chain complexes]]. See at _[[model structure on chain complexes]]_ and _[[derived category]]_.
