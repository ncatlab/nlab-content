## Definition

A **quasi-isomorphism** is a [[chain map]] between [[chain complexes]] which induces an isomorphism on [[chain homology]].  

Quasi-isomorphisms are also called, more descriptively, **homology isomorphisms** or **$H_*$-isomorphisms**.  

## In homotopy theory

Quasi-isomorphisms are the [[weak equivalences]] in the most common [[model category|model category structures]] on the [[category of chain complexes]]. See at _[[model structure on chain complexes]]_.
