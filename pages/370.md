## Idea

A _quasi-isomorphism_ is a [[chain map]] that induces [[isomorphisms]] on all [[homology groups]]. These are the natural choice of [[weak equivalences]] between [[chain complexes]] in the context of ([[stable homotopy theory|stable]]) [[homotopy theory]]. 

The [[localization]] of a [[category of chain complexes]] at the quasi-isomorphisms is called the _[[derived category]]_ of the underlying [[abelian category]]. 

Under the relation between [[topological spaces]] and [[chain complexes]] established by forming [[singular simplicial complexes]], quasi-isomorphism can be understod as the [[abelianization]] of [[weak homotopy equivalences]] (see the [[Hurewicz theorem]] for more on this).

## Definition

Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an [[abelian category]] and write 
$Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A})$ for its [[category of chain complexes]].

###### Definition

A [[chain map]] $f_\bullet : C_\bullet \to D_\bullet$ in $Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A})$ is called a  **quasi-isomorphism** if for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the induced morphisms on [[chain homology]] groups

$$
  H_n(f) \colon H_n(C) \to H_n(D)
$$

is an [[isomorphism]].

###### Remark

Quasi-isomorphisms are also called, more descriptively, **homology isomorphisms** or **$H_\bullet$-isomorphisms**.  See at _[[homology localization]]_ for more on this.

## In homotopy theory

Quasi-isomorphisms are the [[weak equivalences]] in the most common [[model category|model category structures]] on the [[category of chain complexes]]. See at _[[model structure on chain complexes]]_ and _[[derived category]]_.
