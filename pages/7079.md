## Idea

A [[model category]] is a [[homotopical category]] equipped with extra good control over the [[weak equivalences]]. In particular every [[object]] of the category is weakly equivalent to an object that is particularly well behaved for forming [[derived hom-spaces]] _into_ it -- these are the fibrant objects, as well as weakly equivalent to a object that is particularly well-behaved for forming [[derived hom-spaces]] _out of_ it -- these are the cofibrant objects.

Hence fibrant and cofibrant objects are particularly good representatives of objects, which are the "same" as the given objects up to [[weak equivalence]].

These concepts exists also in [[homotopical categories]] with less [[extra structure]] than that of a full [[model category]]. For instance a [[category of fibrant objects]] implements roughly half of the model category axioms, namely those for [[fibrations]] and, as the name indicates, it has a concept of weakly equivalent replacement by fibrant objects, but in general not by cofibrant object. And [[formal dual|dually]], in a [[cofibration category]] there is a notion of cofibrant objects but not necessarily of fibrant objects.

## Definition

In a [[model category]], an [[object]] $X$ is said to be **fibrant** if the unique morphism $X\to 1$ to the [[terminal object]] is a [[fibration]].

$$
  (X \;\; \text{cofibrant})
   \;\;\Leftrightarrow\;\;
  ( 0 \overset{\in Cof}{\longrightarrow} X)
$$

[[formal dual|Dually]], $X$ is said to be **cofibrant** if the unique morphism $0\to X$ from the [[initial object]] is a [[cofibration]].

$$
  (X \;\; \text{fibrant})
   \;\;\Leftrightarrow\;\;
  ( X \overset{\in Fib}{\longrightarrow} 1)
$$


Hence the axiom that every morphism in a model category factors 

1. as an [[acyclic cofibration]] followed by a [[fibration]]

1. as a [[cofibration]] followed by an [[acyclic fibration]]

implies [[fibrant resolution]] and [[cofibrant resolution]] of objects:

For $X$ any object then 

1. the factorization of the terminal morphism as an acyclic cofibration followed by a fibration yields a fibrant object $X_{fib}$ weakly equivalent to $$X

   $$
      X 
        \overset{\in Cof \cap W}{\longrightarrow} 
      X_{cof}
        \overset{\in Fib}{\longrightarrow}
      1
   $$

1. the factorization of the initial morphism as a cofibration followed by an acyclic fibration yields a cofibrant object $X_{cof}$ weakly equivalent to $$X

   $$
     0 
       \overset{\in Cof}{\longrightarrow}
     X_{cof}
       \overset{\in Fib \cap W}{\longrightarrow}
     X
   $$


## Examples

The standard examples appear 

1. in the [[classical model structure on topological spaces]], here every object $X$ is fibrant (namely the [[continuous function]] $X \to \ast$ to the [[point space]] is a [[Serre fibration]]), and the cofibrant objects are the [[retracts]] of [[cell complexes]], in particular the [[CW-complexes]];

1. in the [[classical model structure on simplicial sets]], here every object is cofibrant, and the fibrant objects are the [[Kan complexes]].

Other examples include:

* In the projective [[model structure on dgc-algebras]] in non-negative degree, the cofibrant objects are the [[Sullivan algebras]] (see [there](model+structure+on+dg-algebras#SullivanAlgebras)). This plays a key role in [[rational homotopy theory]]
