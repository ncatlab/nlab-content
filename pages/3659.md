* Wikipedia on the [Osterwalder-Schrader theorem] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osterwalder-Schrader_theorem)

Rough idea: The [[Wightman axioms]] describe how the algebra of observables of a quantum field theory on Minkowski spacetime is generated by quantum fields. The Wightman reconstruction theorem asserts that knowing all correlation functions of all fields in the vacuum state is equivalent to knowing the quantum fields. The Osterwalder-Schrader theorem states conditions that correlation functions on Euclidean spacetime have to satisfy to be equivalent to the correlation functions of a Wightman QFT on Minkowski spacetime.

In this sense the Osterwalder-Schrader theorem states and proves conditions that assure that the Wick rotation is a well defined isomorphism of quantum field theories on Minkowski and on Euclidean spacetime.
