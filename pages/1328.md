#Idea#

[[simplicial presheaf|Simplicial presheaves]] equipped with the [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] are one model/presentation for the [[(infinity,1)-category of (infinity,1)-sheaves]] on a given [[site]].

The fibrant object $\bar X$ that a [[simplicial presheaf]] $X : S^{op} \to SSet$ is weakly equivalent to with respect to this model structure is the [[infinity-stackification]] of $X$. One expects that [[infinity-stack]]s/[[(infinity,1)-sheaf|(infinity,1)-sheaves]] are precisely those [[(infinity,1)-presheaf|(infinity,1)-presheaves]] which satisfy a kind of [[descent]] condition.

Precsisely what this condition is like for the particular model constituted by simplicial presheaves with the given Jardine [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] was worked out in 

* Daniel Dugger, Sharon Hollander, Daniel C. Isaksen, _Hypercovers and simplicial presheaves_ ([web](http://www.math.uiuc.edu/K-theory/0563/)) 

and

* To&euml;n-Vezzosi, _Segal topoi and stacks over Segal categories_ ([pdf](http://poincare.dma.unifi.it/~vezzosi/papers/msri.pdf))

recalled as corollary 6.5.3.13 in 

* [[Jacob Lurie]], [[Higher Topos Theory]].

The following is a summary of these results.

The main point is that the fibrant objects are essentially those simplicial presheaves, which satisfy [[descent]] with respect not just to [[cover]]s, but to [[hypercover]]s.

Localizations of [[(infinity,1)-presheaf|(infinity,1)-presheaves]] at [[hypercover]]s are called [[hypercompletion]]s in [section 6.5.3](http://www-math.mit.edu/~lurie/papers/highertopoi.pdf#page=534) of [[Higher Topos Theory]]. Notice that in [section 6.5.4](http://www-math.mit.edu/~lurie/papers/highertopoi.pdf#page=539) of [[Higher Topos Theory]] it is argued that it may be more natural _not_ to localize at [[hypercover]]s, but just at [[cover]]s after all.

#Details#

A well-studied class of models/presentations for an [[(infinity,1)-category of (infinity,1)-sheaves]] is obtained using the [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] on an  ordinary (1-categorical) [[site]] $S$, as follows.

Let $[S^{op}, SSet]$ be the [[SSet]]-[[enriched category]] of [[simplicial presheaf|simplicial presheaves]] on $S$. 

Recall from [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] that there is the _global_ and the _local_ injective simplicial model structure on $[S^{op}, SSet]$, and that the local model structure is a (Bousfield-)localization of the global model structure.

According to [section 6.5.2](http://www-math.mit.edu/~lurie/papers/highertopoi.pdf#page=528)  of [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT]] we have:

* the full simplicial subcategory on fibrant-cofibrant objects of $[S^{op}, SSet]$ with respect to the _global_ injective model structure is (the [[SSet]]-[[enriched category]] realization of) the $(\infty,1)$-category  $PSh_{(\infty,1)}(S)$ of [[(infinity,1)-presheaf|(infinity,1)-presheaves]] on $S$.

* the full simplicial subcategory on fibrant-cofibrant objects of $[S^{op}, SSet]$ with respect to the _local_ injective model structure is (the [[SSet]]-[[enriched category]] realization of) the $(\infty,1)$-category  $\bar{Sh}_{(\infty,1)}(S)$ which is the [[hypercompletion]] of the $(\infty,1)$-category $Sh_{(\infty,1)}(S)$ of [[(infinity,1)-sheaf|(infinity,1)-sheaves]] on $S$.

Since with respect to the local or global injective model structure all objects are automatically cofibrant, this means that $\bar Sh_{(\infty,1)}(S)$ is the full sub-$(\infty,1)$-category of $PSh_{(\infty,1)}(S)$ on simplicial presheaves which are fibrant with respect to the local injective model structure: these are the [[infinity-stack]]s in this model.

By the general properties of [[localization of an (infinity,1)-category]] there should be a class of morphisms $f : Y \to X$ in $PSh_{(\infty,1)}(S)$ -- hence between injective-fibrant objects in $[S^{op}, PSh(S)]$ -- such that the simplicial presheaves representing $\infty$-stacks are precisely the [[local object]]s with respect to these morphisms.

This was worked out in 

* D. Dugger, S. Hollander, D. Isaksen, _Hypercovers and simplicial presheaves_ ([pdf](http://hopf.math.purdue.edu//Dugger-Hollander-Isaksen/hypspre.pdf))
 
**Definition**

For $X \in S$ an object in the [[site]] regarded as a simplicial presheaf and $U \in [S^{op}, SSet]$ a simplicial presheaf on $S$, a morphism $U \to X$ is a **[[hypercover]]** if it is an acyclic fibration with respect to the local injective [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]].

**Proposition**

The objects of $Sh_{(\infty,1)}(S)$ -- i.e. the fibrant objects with respect to the local injective model structure on $[S^{op}, SSet]$ -- are precisely those objects $A$ of $PSh_{(\infty,1)}(S)$ -- i.e. the fibrant objects with respect to the global injective model structure on $[S^{op}, SSet]$ -- which **satisfy descent for all hypercovers**, i.e. those for which for all hypercover $f : U \to X$ in $[S^{op}, SSet]$ we have that

$$
  [S^{op}, SSet](X,A) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  [S^{op}, SSet](U,A)
$$

is a [[model structure on simplicial sets|weak equivalence of simplicial sets]].

Proof. This is theorem, 1.2 in [DHI](http://hopf.math.purdue.edu//Dugger-Hollander-Isaksen/hypspre.pdf) formulated in the light of lemma 4.4.


By the [[co-Yoneda lemma]] every simplicial presheaf $F : S^{op} \to SSet$ which we may regard as a presheaf $F : \Delta^{op}\times S^{op} \to Set$ is isomorphic to the [[weighted limit|weighted colimit]] $F \simeq lim^\Delta F_\bullet$ with [[SSet]]-weight the canonical cosimplicial simplicial set $\Delta$, i.e. for all $X \in S$

$$
  F : X \mapsto \int^{[n] \in \Delta} \Delta^n \times F(X)_n
  \,.
$$

In particular therefore for $A$ global-injective fibrant the descent condition reads

$$
  [S^{op}, SSet](X,A) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  [S^{op}, SSet](colim^\Delta U_\bullet,A)
  \simeq
  lim^\Delta [S^{op}, SSet](U_\bullet,A)
  \,.
$$

With the shorthand notation introduced above the **descent condition** finally reads, for all global-injective fibrant simplicial presheaves $A$ and hypercovers $U \to X$:

$$
  A(X) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} lim^\Delta A(U_\bullet)
  \,.
$$

The right hand here is often denoted $Desc(U_\bullet \to X, A)$, in which case this reads

$$
  A(X) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} Desc(U_\bullet \to X, A)
  \,.
$$

## formulation in terms of homotopy limit ##

(expanded version of remark 2.1 in [DHI](http://hopf.math.purdue.edu//Dugger-Hollander-Isaksen/hypspre.pdf))


Using the [[Bousfield-Kan map]] every simplicial presheaf $F$ is also weakly equivalent to the weighted limit over $F_\bullet$ with weight given by $N(\Delta/(-)) : \Delta \to SSet$.

$$
  lim^{N(\Delta/(-))} F_\bullet \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  lim^\Delta F_\bullet
  \,.
$$

But by the discussion at [[weighted limit]], the left hand computes the [[homotopy limit]] of $F_\bullet$ (since $F_\bullet$ is objectwise fibrant, since $F_n$ factors through $Set \hookrightarrow SSet$), hence we have a weak equivalence

$$
  holim F_\bullet \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  F
  \,.
$$

Often the descent condition is therefore formulated with the cover $U$ replaced by its homotopy limit, whence it reads

$$
  [S^{op}, SSet](X,A) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  [S^{op}, SSet](hocolim U_\bullet,A)
  \,.
$$

With $A$ global-injective fibrant this is equivalent to

$$
  [S^{op}, SSet](X,A) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  holim [S^{op}, SSet](U_\bullet,A)
  \,.
$$

Using the notation introduced above this becomes finally

$$
  A(X) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} holim A(U_\bullet)
  \,.
$$
