## Definition

A _superpoint_ is a [[supermanifold]] of the form $\mathbb{R}^{0|q}$. 

The object $\mathbb{R}^{0|1}$ is also called the [[odd line]].

The [[category]] of superpoints

$$
  SuperPoint \hookrightarrow SuperMfd
$$

is the [[full subcategory]] of the category of [[supermanifold]]s on the superpoints.

## Properties

The algebra of functions on superpoints are precisely the [[Grassmann algebra]]s (regarded as $\mathbb{Z}-2$ [[graded algebra]]s).

We have an [[equivalence of categories]]

$$
  SuperPoint \simeq GrAlg^{op}
$$

of the category of superpoints with the [[opposite category]] of [[Grassmann allgebra]]s.
