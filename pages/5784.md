## Definition

A _superpoint_ is a [[supermanifold]] of the form $\mathbb{R}^{0|q}$. 

The object $\mathbb{R}^{0|1}$ is also called the [[odd line]].

## Properties

The algebra of functions on superpoints are precisely the [[Grassmann algebra]]s (regarded as $\mathbb{Z}-2$ [[graded algebra]]s).
