According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_Grassmannian), 

> the affine Grassmannian of an algebraic group $G$ over a field $k$ is an [[ind-scheme]] which can be thought of as a flag variety for the loop group $G(k((t)))$

The affine Grassmannian is ind-representable. 
Affine Grassmannian of $SL_n$ admits embedding into [[Sato Grassmanian]].
