## Idea

An _excisive (∞,1)-functor_ $F \colon \mathcal{C} \longrightarrow \mathcal{D}$ is one which sends [[homotopy pushout]] sqaures to [[homotopy pullback]] squares. If $\mathcal{C}$ is [[pointed object|pointed]] [[finite homotopy types]] and $\mathcal{D}$ is [[spectra]], then this condition is the [[axiom]] of [[excision]] in [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology|generalized homotopy]], whence the name.

Moreover, if here $\mathcal{D}$ is instead [[∞Grpd]] (i.e. [[homotopy types]]), or more generally any [[(∞,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$, then excisive functors that send the point to the point (up to equivalence) are still equivalent to [[spectra]] ([[spectrum objects]]) -- essentially by the [[Brown representability theorem]] -- and those without restriction are equivalent to [[parameterized spectra]], hence form the [[tangent (∞,1)-topos]] $T \mathbf{H}$.

As such, excisive functors are the lowest nontrivial stage in the [[Goodwillie-Taylor tower]] that approximates the [[classifying (∞,1)-topos]] $\\mathbf{H}[X_\bullet]$ for [[pointed objects]]. The higher stages of this tower are given by the [[n-excisive (∞,1)-functors]].

## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

An [[(∞,1)-functor]] $F \colon \mathcal{C} \longrightarrow \mathcal{D}$ out of an [[(∞,1)-category]] with [[finite (∞,1)-colimits]] is **excisive** if it takes [[(∞,1)-pushout]] squares in $\mathcal{C}$ to [[(∞,1)-pullback]] squares $\mathcal{D}$. 

This is the $n=1$ case of the concept [[n-excisive (∞,1)-functor]].

## Properties

### Reflection and excisive approximation


The inclusion of excisive $\infty$-funcors is reflective with reflector $P_1$.

See at _[n-excisive functor -- n-Excisive Approximation and reflection](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/n-excisive+functor#nExcisiveApproximation)_

## Examples

### Spectrum objects
 {#SpectrumObjects}

Write $\infty Grpd_{fin}$ for the [[(∞,1)-category]] of [[finite homotopy types]], hence those freely generated by [[finite (∞,1)-colimits]] from the point. Write $\infty Grpd_{fin}^{\ast/}$ for the [[pointed object|pointed]] finite homotopy types.


+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Proposition

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an [[(∞,1)-category]] with [[finite (∞,1)-limits]]. Then **[[spectrum object]]** in $\mathcal{C}$ are equivalently  [[reduced (infinity,1)-functor|reduced]] [[excisive (∞,1)-functor]] of the form

$$
  \infty Grpd_{fin}^{\ast/} \longrightarrow \mathcal{C}
  \,.
$$

=--

(Sometimes, e.g. in [Lurie, def. 1.4.2.8](#HigherAlg), this is taken as the very definition of spectrum objects).

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let $F$ be a reduced excisive functor $E$.

For each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, write $S^n \in \infty Grpd_{fin}^{\ast/}$ for the [[n-sphere]] and write $E_{n} \coloneqq E(S^n)$. We have the homotopy pushout squares

$$
  \array{
    S^n &\longrightarrow& \ast
    \\
    \downarrow & & \downarrow
    \\
    \ast &\longrightarrow& S^{n+1}
  }
$$ 

and since $E$ sends them to homotopy pullbacks with the point going to the point, this gives equivalences

$$
  E_n \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} \Omega E_{n+1}
  \,.
$$

If this were all the data in $E$, it would manifestly exhibit $E_\bullet$ as being equivalently an [[Omega spectrum]]. And indeed this is all the data in $E$: 

Since [[finite homotopy types]] are given by a finite number of sphere attachments, hence a finite number of [[homotopy pushouts]] with $n$-spheres, it follows that the value of $E$ on any pointed finite homotopy type $X$ is the [[smash product]] $\Omega^\infty(X \wedge E_\bullet)$, hence the [[generalized homology]] $E(X)$. That this assignment still sends all possible homotopy pushouts to homotopy pullback is then the excision axiom for the [[generalized homology]] theory thus given, and it does hold due to the [[Brown representability theorem]].

=--

The same proof, with the point going to any space $E(\ast)$, gives that $E$ is a [[parameterized spectrum]] over $E(\ast)$.

### Excisive approximation of reduced functors

Let $\mathcal{C}$ have finite colimits and a terminal object and let $\mathcal{D}$ be differentiable.

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The excisive approximation of a [[reduced functor]] $F \colon \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ is the [[(infinity,1)-colimit]]

$$
  P_1 F 
    \simeq 
  \underset{\longrightarrow_{\mathrlap{k}}}{\lim} 
  ( \Omega^k \circ F \circ \Sigma^k)
$$

(where $\Omega$ and $\Sigma$ denote [[looping]] and [[suspension]] in $\mathcal{D}$ and in $\mathcal{C}$, respectively).
