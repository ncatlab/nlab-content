## Idea

The general notion is that of

* _[[separated geometric morphism]]_ between [[toposes]].

Special cases include the notion

* [[quasi-separated morphism]] of schemes 

which is a bit weaker than

* _[[separated morphism of schemes]]_.


## Related concepts

* [[open morphism]]

* [[closed morphism]]

* [[étale morphism]]
