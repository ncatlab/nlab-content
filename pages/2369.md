## Idea

The terminology  _(commutative) ring spectrum_ refers either to a ([[commutative monoid|commutative]]) [[monoid]] in the [[stable homotopy category]] regarded as [[monoidal category]] via the [[smash product of spectra]], or to the richer structure of a [[monoid]] in a [[model structure for spectra]] equipped with a [[symmetric smash product of spectra]]. 

In the first case a ring spectrum is a [[spectrum]] equipped with a unit and product operation, which is associative, unital  (and commutative) just up to unspecified [[homotopy]] (such as in an [[H-space]] structure). In the second case the structure is much richer; and in good cases, such as for [[highly structured spectra]], is equivalent to [[A-∞ ring]] structure ([[E-∞ ring]] structure).

To distinguish the two situations further qualification is being used. Sometimes one says **homotopy ring spectrum** to explicitly refer to the first case (e.g. [Schwede 12, chapter II 4.1](#Schwede12)) or one says "[[highly structured ring spectrum]]" to refer explicitly to the second case. For more on this see at _[[brave new algebra]]_ and _[[higher algebra]]_.

Since the concept of [[spectrum]] is the refinement of the concept of [[abelian group]] to [[homotopy theory]]/[[(∞,1)-category theory]]. The concept of **ring spectrum** is the corresponding generalization of the notion of ([[commutative ring|commutative]]) [[ring]].

## Definition

For details see _[[Introduction to Stable homotopy theory]]_, _[[Introduction to Stable homotopy theory -- 1-2|Part 1-2 -- Structured spectra]]_.

## Properties

### Relation to multiplicative generalized cohomology

Under the [[Brown representability theorem]], the [[generalized cohomology theory]] represented by a ring spectrum inherits the structure of a [[multiplicative cohomology theory]].
