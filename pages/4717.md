
Given an [[adjunction]]

![codecogs](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\xymatrix{X\ar@/_/[dd]_L\\\vdash\\Y\ar@/_/[uu]_R} "\xymatrix{X\ar@/_/[dd]_L\\\vdash\\Y\ar@/_/[uu]_R}"),

there is a [[natural transformation]] (or more generally, a $2$-[[2-morphism|morphism]]) $\eta\colon id_X \to R \circ L$, called the __unit__ of the adjunction.  (This is so called because $R \circ L$ is a [[monad]], which is a kind of [[monoid object]], and $\eta$ is the [[identity element|identity]] of this monoid.  Since 'identity' in this context would suggest an [[identity natural transformation]], we use the synonym 'unit'.)

Similarly, there is $2$-morphism $\epsilon\colon L \circ R \to id_Y$, called the __counit__ of the adjunction.  (This is the co-identity of the [[comonad]] $L \circ R$.)
