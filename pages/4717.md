## Definition


Given an [[adjunction]]

$$
  (L \dashv R)
  \;\colon\;
  X
    \stackrel{\overset{L}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{R}{\longleftarrow}}
  Y
$$

there is a [[natural transformation]] (or more generally, a $2$-[[2-morphism|morphism]]) $\eta\colon id_X \to R \circ L$, called the __unit__ of the adjunction.  (A reason for the name is that $R \circ L$ is a [[monad]], which is a kind of [[monoid object]], and $\eta$ is the [[identity element|identity]] of this monoid.  Since 'identity' in this context would suggest an [[identity natural transformation]], we use the synonym 'unit'.)

Similarly, there is $2$-morphism $\epsilon\colon L \circ R \to id_Y$, called the __counit__ of the adjunction.  (This is the co-identity of the [[comonad]] $L \circ R$.)

## Properties

### General

Unit and counit of an adjunction satisfy the [[triangle identities]].

An [[adjunct]] is given by precomposition with a unit or postcomposition with a counit.

### Relation to monads

Every [[adjunction]] $(L \dashv R)$ gives rise to a [[monad]] $T \coloneqq R \circ L$. The [[unit of a monad|unit of this monad]] $id \to T$ is the unit of the adjunction, $id \to R \circ L$.
