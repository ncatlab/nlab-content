## Definitions

A __binary operation__ on a [[set]] $S$ is a [[function]] from $S \times S$ to $S$.  A __magma__ (binary algebraic structure) is a set equipped with a binary operation on it. A magma is __unital__ if it has a [[identity element|neutral element]] $1$. Some authors mean by 'magma' what we call a unital magma (cf. [[Borceux-Bourn]] Def. 1.2.1). The [[Eckmann-Hilton argument]] holds for unital magma structures: two compatible ones on a set must be equal and commutative.

The term 'magma' is from [[Bourbaki]] and intends to suggest the fluidity of the concept; special cases include [[semigroup]]s, [[quasigroup]]s, [[group]]s, and so on.  The term 'groupoid' is also used, but here that word means [[groupoid|something else]] (see also related discussion at [[historical notes on quasigroups]]).

More generally, in any [[multicategory]] $M$, a **magma object** or **magma in $M$** is an [[object]] $X$ of $M$ equipped with a [[multimorphism]] $m: X, X \to X$ in $M$.  Here the multimorphism from $X$ and $X$ to $X$ is a __binary operation in $M$__.  In particular, for $M$ a [[monoidal category]], a magma structure on $X$ is a [[morphism]] $m\colon X \otimes X \to X$; and in a [[closed category]], a magma structure on $X$ is a morphisms $m\colon X \to [X, X]$.


## Literature

The wikipedia entry [magma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magma_%28algebra%29) is quite useful, having a list and a table of various subclasses of magmas, hence of binary algebraic structures.
