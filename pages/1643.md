## Definitions

A __binary operation__ on a [[set]] $S$ is a [[function]] $(-)\cdot (-) \colon S \times S \to S$ from the [[Cartesian product]] $S \times S$ to $S$.  A __magma__ (or binary algebraic structure, or, alternatively, a mono-binary algebra) $(S,\cdot)$ is a set equipped with a binary operation on it. 

A magma is called

* _[[unital magma|unital]]_ if it has a [[identity element|neutral element]] $1$, hence an element $1 \in S$ in that $1 \cdot x = x = x \cdot 1$;  

  (Some authors mean by 'magma' what we call a unital magma (cf. [[Borceux-Bourn]] Def. 1.2.1). One can consider one-sided unital elements separately: $1_L \cdot x = x$ and/or $x = x \cdot 1_R$. Units may be far from unique.)

* _[[commutative magma|commutative]]_ if the binary operation takes the same value when its two arguments are interchanged: $x \cdot y = y \cdot x$;

* _[[associative magma|associative]]_ if the binary operation satisfies the [[associativity]] condition $(x \cdot y) \cdot z = x \cdot (y \cdot z)$;

* _[[invertible magma|invertible]]_ if it has an [[inverse element]].

* an _[[absorption magma]]_ if it has an element $0 \in S$ such that the binary opetation satisfies the absorption condition: $0 \cdot x = x \cdot 0 = 0$;

* a *[[quasigroup]]* if one-sided multiplication by any element is a [[bijection]].

A magma has a [[square root]] [[function]] $\sqrt{-}:S \times S \to S$ if for all $x \in S$, $\sqrt{x \cdot x} = x$ and $\sqrt{x} \cdot \sqrt{x} = x$. 

The term 'magma' is from [[Bourbaki]] and intends to suggest the fluidity of the concept; special cases include [[unital magmas]], [[semigroups]]/[[monoids]], [[quasigroups]], [[groups]], and so on.  The term 'groupoid' is also used, but here that word means [[groupoid|something else]] (see also related discussion at [[historical notes on quasigroups]]).

More generally, in any [[multicategory]] $M$, a **magma object** or **magma in $M$** is an [[object]] $X$ of $M$ equipped with a [[multimorphism]] $m: X, X \to X$ in $M$.  Here the multimorphism from $X$ and $X$ to $X$ is a __binary operation in $M$__.  In particular, for $M$ a [[monoidal category]], a magma structure on $X$ is a [[morphism]] $m\colon X \otimes X \to X$; and in a [[closed category]], a magma structure on $X$ is a morphisms $m\colon X \to [X, X]$.

## Properties

### Square function {#square function}

Every magma $(M,\cdot)$ has a morphism $(-)^2:M \to M$ called the __square__ and defined as $x^2 := x \cdot x$ for all $x \in M$. 

### Magmas as actions

An [[action]] of a set $A$ on another set $B$ is a function $act:A \times B \to B$. So this means that a magma is just an action of a set on itself. 

### Opposite magmas

There exists a function on the binary operation set $B:(M\times M\to M)\to (M\times M\to M)$ called the __[[braiding]]__ that takes every binary operation on the set to its opposite binary operation, where for every magma operation $m:M\times M\to M$ and for all elements $a,b$ in $M$, $B(m)(a,b) = m(b,a)$. The set $M$ with the opposite binary operation is the [[opposite magma]] of $M$. $B$ is an [[involution]]; the opposite of an opposite magma is the original magma itself; this follows from the fact that [[Set]] is a [[symmetric monoidal category]]. Fixed points of $B$ are called __[[commutative magma|commutative]]__ binary operations. 

## Free magmas

The free magma on one generator $(M, \cdot, 1)$ is a model of nesting parentheses around a magma, and is important in the study of [[higher category theory]] as [[composition]] of [[morphisms]] in [[(n,r)-categories]] and [[(infinity,n)-categories]] are not [[associative]], but rather satisfy [[coherence laws]] such as the [[pentagon identity]] which relate the various ways to nest parentheses around the [[tensor product]] magma in an [[(infinity,n)-category]] with respect to [[homotopy equivalence]]. Many other higher categorical objects have [[coherence theorems]] which also deal with nested parentheses around a binary operation. 

## Extensional magmas

In [[foundations of mathematics]] such as [[intensional type theory|intensional]] Martin-Loef [[dependent type theory]], where [[functions]] do not [[function extensionality|preserve equality]], one could distinguish between ordinary magmas as defined above, and __extensional magmas__, whose binary operation preserves equality. 

For a magma $(A, \cdot)$ and for all elements $a, b, c:A$, a magma is __left extensional__ if $a = c$ implies $a \cdot b = c \cdot b$, and a magma is __right extensional__ if $a = c$ implies $b \cdot a = b \cdot c$. A magma is __extensional__ if it is both left and right extensional.

The wikipedia entry [magma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magma_%28algebra%29) is quite useful, having a list and a table of various subclasses of magmas, hence of binary algebraic structures.
