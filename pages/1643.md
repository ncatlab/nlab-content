A __binary operation__ on a [[set]] $S$ is a [[function]] from $S \times S$ to $S$.  A __magma__ is a set equipped with a binary operation on it.

The term 'magma' is from [[Bourbaki]] and intends to suggest the fluidity of the concept; special cases include [[semigroup]]s, [[quasigroup]]s, [[group]]s, and so on.  The term 'groupoid' is also used, but here that word means [[groupoid|something else]].

More generally, in any [[monoidal category]] $M$, a **magma object** or **magma in $M$** is an [[object]] $X$ of $M$ equipped with a [[morphism]] $m: X \otimes X \to X$ in $M$.  Here the morphism from $X \otimes X$ to $X$ is a __binary operation in $M$__.
