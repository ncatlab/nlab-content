## Idea


The [[differential geometry]] of [[manifold]]s with [[spin structure]] is called **spin geometry**. It studies [[spin group]]-[[principal bundle]]s, spin-[[representation]]s and the corresponding [[associated bundle]]s over spin manifolds. Their spaces of [[section]]s notably support [[Dirac operator]]s.

## In physics

The relevance of spin geometry in [[physics]] rests on the fact that in [[quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum field theory]] in general and in the [[standard model of particle physics]] in particular, [[fermion]]s such as the [[electron]] are mathematically modeled as [[sections]] of spin-bundles. The very term _spin_ originates in the fact that the quanta of these fields behave to some extent as if they had an intrinsic [[angular momentum]], as if they were _spinning_ about an axis as a classical top. 

Spin geometry also plays a central role in supersymmetric quantum field theory such as [[supergravity]].
