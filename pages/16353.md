## Statements

Let $X$ be a [[smooth manifold]] and write $C^\infty(X)$ for its [[algebra of functions|algebra]] of [[smooth functions]] and $Vect(X) = \Gamma(T X)$ for the space of smooth [[vector fields]] on $X$.

###### Theorem


1. The operation of [[differentiation]] with respect to a [[vector field]]  is a [[derivations]] of $C^\infty(X)$.

1. Every [[derivation]] on $C^\infty(X)$ arises this way.

Hence there is an [[isomorphism]]

$$
  Vect(X) \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} Der(C^\infty(X))
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

This is true because $C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)$ satisfies the [[Hadamard lemma]]. More in detail:

By the existence of [[partitions of unity]] we may restrict to the situation for $X = \mathbb{R}^n$ a [[Cartesian space]].
By the [[Hadamard lemma]] every [[smooth function]] $f \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)$ may be written as

$$
  f(x) = f(0) + \sum_i x_i g_i(x)
$$

for smooth $\{g_i \in C^\infty(X)\}$ with $g_i(0) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}(0)$. Since every [[derivation]] $\delta : C^\infty(X) \to C^\infty(X)$ by definition satisfies the Leibniz rule, it follows that

$$
  \delta(f)(0) = \sum_i \delta(x_i) \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}(0)
  \,.
$$

Similarly, by translation, at all other points. Therefore $\delta$ is already fixed by its action of the coordinate functions $\{x_i \in C^\infty(X)\}$. Let $v_\delta \in T \mathbb{R}^n$ be the [[vector field]] 

$$
  v_\delta \coloneqq \sum_i \delta(x_i) \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}
$$

then it follows that $\delta$ is the derivation coming from $v_\delta$ under $Vect(X) \to Der(C^\infty(X))$.

###### Remark

Via the [[embedding of smooth manifolds into formal duals of R-algebras]] and observing that algebra homomorphisms of the form $C^\infty(X)[\epsilon]/(\epsilon^2)\leftarrow C^\infty(X)$ which are the identity modulo $\epsilon$ are equivalently [[derivations]], 
theorem \ref{Statement} is the starting point for generalizations of [[smooth manifolds]] to [[formal smooth manifolds]] and more generally of [[differential geometry]] to _[[synthetic differential geometry]]_.

###### Remark

Beware however that related algebraic properties familiar from [[affine schemes]] may break, notably for the [[Kähler differential forms]] of $C^\infty(X)$ to come out as the expected smooth [[differential forms]] one needs to refine the plain $\mathbb{R}$-[[commutative algebra]] $C^\nfty(X)$ to the structure of a _[[smooth algebra]]_.
