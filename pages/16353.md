## Ideap

On a [[smooth manifold]] $X$ the smooth [[tangent vector fields]] $v \in \Gamma_X(T X)$ are geometrically defined as smoothly varying collections of smooth [[paths]] $\gamma_x \colon \mathbb{R}^1 \to X$ through every point $x \in X$ (i.e. $\gamma(0) = x$), with two such paths regarded as equivalent if their first [[derivative]] $v_x \in T_x X$ at $x$, seen in any [[chart]], coincides.

Now by pre-composing a [[smooth function]] $f \colon  X \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^1$ which such a path, we obtain a function $f\circ \gamma_x \;\colon\; \mathbb{R}^1 \to \mathbb{R}^1$ from the [[real line]] to itself. Therefore its [[derivative]] 

$$
  (D_v f)(x) \coloneqq  d (f \circ \gamma)_0
$$

may be identified with a [[real number]] (measuring the rate of change of $f$ along $\gamma$ at $x$ to first order). Since $\gamma_x$, or rather its derivative $v_x \in T_x X$, is assumed to depend smoothly on $x$, this defines a new smooth function

$$
  D_v f \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^1
  \,.
$$ 

Due to the [[product rule]] of differentiation, this assignment $f \mapsto D_v f$ is such that for $f,g \in C^\infty(X)$ two smooth functions, with pointwise product function $f \cdot g$ then 

$$
  D_v(f \cdot g)
  \;=\;
  D_v(f) \cdot g + f \cdot D_v(g)
  \,.
$$

This means that $D_v \;\colon\; C^\infty(C) \to C^\infty(X)$ is a _[[derivation]]_ on the algebra of smooth functions.

Remarkably, _all_ derivations on $C^\infty(X)$ arise this way, and for a unique vector field $v \in \Gamma_X(T X)$:

$$
  \left\{
    \array{
      \text{derivations on}
      \\
      \text{algebra of smooth functions}
      \\
      \text{on}\, X
    }
  \right\}
  \;\simeq\;
  \left\{
     \array{
        \text{smooth}
        \\
        \text{tangent vector fields}
        \\
        \text{on}\, X
     }
  \right\}
$$

Notice that the concept of derivations is purely a concept of [[algebra]], with no input from the [[topology]] and [[differential geometry]] that goes into the definition and construction of smooth manifolds and their tangent bundles. 
Therefore the identification of smooth vector fields with derivations is therefore an algebraic incarnation of an aspect of differential geometry which is comparable two two other such phenomena:

* [[embedding of smooth manifolds into formal duals of R-algebras]];

* [[smooth Serre-Swan theorem]]

###### Theorem

Let $X$ be a [[smooth manifold]]. 

Write 

1. $C^\infty(X)$ for its real [[algebra of functions|algebra]] of [[smooth functions]] $X \to \mathbb{R}^1$ (under pointwise multiplication);

1. $\Gamma_X(T X)$ for the [[real vector space]] of smooth [[tangent vector fields]] on $X$, hence the space of smooth [[sections]] of the [[tangent bundle]] $T X$ of $X$, regarded as a [[smooth vector bundle]].

1, $Der(C^\infty(X))$ for the [[real vector space]] of $\mathbb{R}$-linear [[derivations]] of the $\mathbb{R}$-algebra $C^\infty(X)$ 

Then:

1. The operation of [[differentiation]] with respect to a [[vector field]]  is a [[derivation]] of $C^\infty(X)$.

1. Every [[derivation]] on $C^\infty(X)$ arises this way, for a unique vector field.

Hence there is an [[isomorphism]]

$$
  D_{(-)}
    \;\colon\;
  \Gamma_X(T X) \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} Der(C^\infty(X))
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let $v \in \Gamma_X(T X)$ be a smooth tangent vector field. 

This means first of all that for each $x \in X$ there is a [[smooth function]] $\gamma_x \;\colon\; \mathbb{R}^1 \longrightarrow X$ such that 

1. $\gamma_x(0) = x$

1. $d \gamma_x_0 = v_x \in T_x X$.

Then for $f \colon X \to \mathbb{R}^1$ a smooth function, define a new function 

$$
  D_v(f) \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^1
$$

by

$$
  (D_v(f))(x) \coloneqq d (f \circ \gamma_x)_0 = \frac{d}{d t} (f(\gamma_x(t)))\vert_{t = 0}
  \,.
$$

By the linearity of differentation we have for $c \in \mathbb{R}$ that $D_v(c \cdot f) = c \cdot D_v(f)$. Moreover, by the [[product rule]] for differentiation we have for $f,g \in C^\infty(X)$ two smooth functions, that

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    D_v( f \cdot g)
    & =
    \frac{d}{d t}( (f \cdot g)(\gamma(t)) )\vert_{t = 0}
    \\
    & =
    \frac{d}{ d t}( f(\gamma_x(t)) \cdot g(\gamma_x(t)) )\vert_{t = 0}
    \\
    & =
    \left( \frac{d}{d t}  f(\gamma_x(t))\vert_{t = 0}  \right) \cdot g(\gamma_x(0))
    + 
    f(\gamma_x(0)) \cdot   
    \left(
      \frac{d}{d t} g(\gamma(t))\vert_{t = 0}
    \right)
    =
    (D_v(f) \cdot g + f \cdot D_v(g))(x) 
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

Therefore it only remains to check that the function $D_v(f)$ is a smooth function in the first place.

Let

$$
  \left\{ \mathbb{R}^n \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi_i}{\to} U_i \subset X \right\}
$$

be an [[atlas]] that exhibits the [[smooth structure]] of $X$, hence an [[open cover]] by subsets equiiped with a [[diffeomorphism]] $\phi_i$ from a [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ with its standard smooth structure. 

By definition of the [[tangent bundle]] $T X$, its restriction to any [[chart]] of this atlas is diffeomorphic to 

$$
  \array{
    \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n
      && \underoverset{\simeq}{\psi_i}{\longrightarrow} && 
    T X\vert_{U_i}
    \\
    & {}_{\phi_i \circ \mathllap{pr_1}}\searrow && \swarrow_{p\vert_{U_i}}
    \\
    && U_i
  }
$$


This is true because $C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)$ satisfies the [[Hadamard lemma]]. More in detail:

By the existence of [[partitions of unity]] we may restrict to the situation for $X = \mathbb{R}^n$ a [[Cartesian space]].
By the [[Hadamard lemma]] every [[smooth function]] $f \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)$ may be written as

$$
  f(x) = f(0) + \sum_i x_i g_i(x)
$$

for smooth $\{g_i \in C^\infty(X)\}$ with $g_i(0) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}(0)$. Since every [[derivation]] $\delta : C^\infty(X) \to C^\infty(X)$ by definition satisfies the Leibniz rule, it follows that

$$
  \delta(f)(0) = \sum_i \delta(x_i) \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}(0)
  \,.
$$

Similarly, by translation, at all other points. Therefore $\delta$ is already fixed by its action of the coordinate functions $\{x_i \in C^\infty(X)\}$. Let $v_\delta \in T \mathbb{R}^n$ be the [[vector field]] 

$$
  v_\delta \coloneqq \sum_i \delta(x_i) \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}
$$

then it follows that $\delta$ is the derivation coming from $v_\delta$ under $Vect(X) \to Der(C^\infty(X))$.

###### Remark

Via the [[embedding of smooth manifolds into formal duals of R-algebras]] and observing that algebra homomorphisms of the form $C^\infty(X)[\epsilon]/(\epsilon^2)\leftarrow C^\infty(X)$ which are the identity modulo $\epsilon$ are equivalently [[derivations]], 
theorem \ref{Statement} is the starting point for generalizations of [[smooth manifolds]] to [[formal smooth manifolds]] and more generally of [[differential geometry]] to _[[synthetic differential geometry]]_.

###### Remark

Beware however that related algebraic properties familiar from [[affine schemes]] may break, notably for the [[KÃ¤hler differential forms]] of $C^\infty(X)$ to come out as the expected smooth [[differential forms]] one needs to refine the plain $\mathbb{R}$-[[commutative algebra]] $C^\nfty(X)$ to the structure of a _[[smooth algebra]]_.
