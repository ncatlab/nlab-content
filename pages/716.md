## Definition

A **compact closed category**, or simply a **compact category**, is a [[symmetric monoidal category]] in which every object is [[dualizable object|dualizable]].

In particular, a compact closed category is a [[closed monoidal category]], with the [[internal hom]] given by $[A,B] = A^* \otimes B$ (where $A^*$ is the dual of $A$).

More generally, if we drop the symmetry requirement, we obtain a [[rigid monoidal category]], a.k.a. an *autonomous category*.  Thus a compact category may also be called a **rigid symmetric monoidal category** or a **symmetric autonomous category**.  A maximally clear, but rather verbose, term would be a **symmetric monoidal category with duals for objects**.
