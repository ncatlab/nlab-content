## Idea

The **Freyd cover** of a [[category]] is a special case of [[Artin gluing]].  Given a category $\mathcal{T}$ and a [[functor]] $F: \mathcal{T} \to Set$, the Artin gluing of $F$ is the [[comma category]] $Set \downarrow F$ whose objects are triples $(X, \xi, U)$ where:

* $X$ is a set
* $U$ is an object of $\mathcal{T}$
* $\xi$ is a function $X \to F(U)$.

The Freyd cover is the special case $F = \mathcal{T} (1, -)$.

The Freyd cover is sometimes known as the **Sierpinski cone** or **scone**, because in [[topos theory]] it behaves similarly to the [[cone]] on a space, but with the [[interval]] $[0,1]$ replaced by the [[Sierpinski space]].

## Properties

### Relation to the initial topos

One of the first applications of the Freyd cover was to deduce facts about the [[initial topos]] (initial with respect to [[logical morphism|logical morphisms]] --- also called the *free topos*). They were originally proved by syntactic means; the conceptual proofs of the lemma and theorem below are due to Freyd.

###### Lemma 
For any category $C$ with a terminal object $\mathbf{1}$, the terminal object of the Freyd cover $\widehat{C}$ is connected and projective, i.e., the representable $\Gamma = \widehat{C}(1, -) \colon \widehat{C} \to Set$ preserves any colimits that exist.

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
To check that $\Gamma^{op} \colon \widehat{C}^{op} \to Set^{op}$ preserves limits, it suffices to check that the composite 

$$\widehat{C}^{op} \stackrel{\Gamma^{op}}{\to} Set^{op} \stackrel{2^-}{\to} Set$$ 

preserves limits, because the contravariant power set functor $P = 2^-$ is monadic. But it is easily checked that this composite is the contravariant representable given by $(2, \mathbf{1}, 2 \to \Gamma(\mathbf{1}))$.

###### Theorem 
The terminal object in the initial topos $\mathcal{T}$ is connected and projective, i.e., $\Gamma = \hom(1, -) \colon \mathcal{T} \to Set$ preserves finite colimits. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
We divide the argument into three segments: 

* The hom-functor preserves finite limits, so by general properties of Artin gluing, the Freyd cover $\widehat{\mathcal{T}}$ is also a topos. Observe that $\mathcal{T}$ is equivalent to the slice $\widehat{\mathcal{T}}/M$ where $M$ is the object $(\emptyset, \mathbf{1}, \emptyset \to \Gamma(\mathbf{1}))$. Since pulling back to a slice is a logical functor, we have a logical functor 
$$\pi \colon \widehat{\mathcal{T}} \to \mathcal{T}$$ 
Since $\mathcal{T}$ is initial, $\pi$ is a retraction for the unique logical functor $i \colon \mathcal{T} \to \widehat{\mathcal{T}}$. 

* We have maps $\mathcal{T}(1, -) \to \widehat{\mathcal{T}}(i 1, i-) \cong \widehat{\mathcal{T}}(1, i-)$ (the isomorphism comes from $i 1 \cong 1$, which is clear since $i$ is logical), and $\widehat{\mathcal{T}}(1, i-) \to \mathcal{T}(\pi 1, \pi i-) \cong \mathcal{T}(1, -)$ since $\pi$ is logical and retracts $i$. Their composite must be the identity on $\mathcal{T}(1, -)$, because there is only one such endomorphism, using the Yoneda lemma and terminality of $1$. 

Finally, since $\mathcal{T}(1, -)$ is a retract of a functor $\widehat{\mathcal{T}}(1, i-)$ that preserves finite colimits (by the lemma, and the fact that the logical functor $i$ preserves finite colimits), it must also preserve finite colimits.

This is important because it implies that the [[internal logic]] of the free topos (which is exactly "intuitionistic higher-order logic") satisfies the following properties:

* The *disjunction property*: if "P [[or]] Q" is provable in the empty [[context]], then either P is so provable, or Q is so provable.  (Note that this clearly fails in the presence of [[excluded middle]].)

* The *existence property*: if "there exists an $x\in A$ such that $P(x)$" is provable in the empty context, then there exists a [[global element]] $x\colon 1\to A$ such that $P(x)$ is provable in the empty context.  (Again, this is clearly a [[constructive mathematics|constructivity]] property.)

* The *negation property*: False is not provable in the empty context.


### As a local topos
 {#AsALocalTopos}

The Freyd cover of a [[topos]] is a [[local topos]], and in fact freely so. Every local topos is a [[retract]] of a Freyd cover.
