## Idea

The **Freyd cover** of a [[category]] -- sometimes known as the **Sierpinski cone** or "scone" --  is a special case of Artin gluing: 

given a category $\mathcal{T}$ and a [[functor]] $F: \mathcal{T} \to Set$, the Artin gluing of $F$ is the [[comma category]] $Set \downarrow F$ whose objects are triples $(X, \xi, U)$ where:

* $X$ is a set
* $U$ is an object of $\mathcal{T}$
* $\xi$ is a function $X \to F(U)$.

So the Freyd cover is the special case $F = \mathcal{T} (1, -)$.
