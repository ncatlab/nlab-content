## Idea

The _covariant phase space_ of a system in [[physics]] is the [[space]] of all of its solutions to its [[classical mechanics|classical equations of motion]], the space of _classical trajectories_ of the system. 

For a system described by [[Lagrangian]] mechanics this comes canonically equipped with a [[presymplectic structure]]. A proper _phase space_ or _reduced phase space_ is a subspace or [[quotient space]] of the covariant phase space on which the presymplectic structure refines to a [[symplectic manifold|symplectic structure]] or [[Poisson manifold|Poisson strucure]]. 

Typically these phase spaces are (locally) naturally parameterized by the suitable boundary conditions which uniquely determine the corresponding history of the physical system. Much of the literature on phase spaces deals with parameterizing these boundary conditions. 

For instance for a [[relativistic particle|particle]] propagating on a [[Riemannian manifold]] $X$ with the usual [[action functional]], a trajectory is uniquely fixed by the position $x \in X$ and the momentum $p \in T^*_x X$ of the particle at a given time. Correspondingly the space of all solutions and hence the (covariant) phase space of the system may be identified with the [[cotangent bundle]] $T^* X$ of $X$.  
 
However, even reduced phase spaces are not all cotangent bundles, typically not, for instance, if they are obtained by [[symplectic reduction]]. This way a finite-dimensional phase space can sometimes describe continuous systems (e.g. in hydrodynamics) whch have infinitely many degrees of freedom; that phase space is however not a cotangent bundle of something in general. 


## Covariant phase space

There are two main routes to the construction of the covariant phase space, 

* (S) via [[presymplectic structure]];

* (P) via [[Poisson algebra]] structure.

### (S) Via pre-symplectic structures
 {#ViaSymplecticStructure}

We describe the canonical [[presymplectic structure]] on the covariant phase space of a [[local action functional]].
Terminology is as in the discussion at [[variational bicomplex]].

Let $E \to X$ be a smooth [[fiber bundle]] over [[spacetime]] $X$ and $J(E)$ the corresponding [[jet bundle]]. The [[local action functional]]

$$
  S : \Gamma(E) \to \mathbb{R}
$$

is by definition given by a [[Lagrangian]]

$$
  L : \Gamma(J(E)) \to \Omega^{dim X}(X)
$$

as

$$
  S : \phi \mapsto \int_X L(j_\infty(\phi))
  \,.
$$

The [[variational calculus|variation]] of $S$ is

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \delta S (\phi) 
     &= 
    \int_X \delta L(j_\infty(\phi))
    \\
     &= 
    \int_X EL(\phi) \delta \phi 
      + 
     \int_X d_{dR} \theta_\phi(\delta \phi)
    \,,
  \end{aligned}
$$

where $EL(\phi) = 0$ is the [[Euler-Lagrange equation]] on $\phi$ and where $\theta$ is a deggre-$(1, dim X - 1)$ element in the [[variational bicomplex]] (one variational form degree and $(dim X - 1)$-spacetime form degrees). On a local [[coordinate]] patch $\{x^i\}$ for $X$ this is 

$$
  \theta 
    = 
  (\iota_{\partial_i} \frac{\partial L}{\partial_i \phi^a} )
   \delta \phi^a
  \,.
$$

The variational 1-form

$$
  \Theta = \int_{X|_{in}} \theta 
$$

given by an [[integration]] over a [[Cauchy surface]] $X|_{in}$ is the potential for the presymplectic form 

$$
  \Omega = \delta \Theta
$$

on covariant phase space.

Notice that this does depend on the choice of Cauchy surface. Performing [[symplectic reduction]] gives the symplectic space of equivalence classes of solutions of equations of motion modulo [[gauge transformation]]s, which is the _reduced phase space_ . The end point of the reduction no longer depends on the choice of the Cauchy surface.

### (P) Via Poisson structures
 {#ViiaPoissonStructure}
 
The covariant phase space can be embedded into the 
[[space of field configurations]] as a subspace of the set of solutions that transversely intersects [[gauge orbit]]s. This embedding is characterized as the [[zero locus]] of the [[equations of motion]] and some [[gauge fixing]] conditions. The non-degenerate [[Poisson structure]] on the algebra of functions on the covariant phase space is given by the [[Peierls bracket]]. 

The Peierls bracket of two functions $A$ and $B$ is the antisymmetrized influence on $B$ of an infinitesimal perturbation of a gauge-fixed action by function that restricts to $A$ on the embedding. The algebra of functions on the space of field configurations becomes a [[Poisson algebra]] in the following way. Pick a set of functions on the space of field configurations that restrict to a non-degenerate coordinate system on the embedded covariant phase space. These functions, together with the equations of motion and gauge fixing conditions define a Poisson bivector by being declared canonical, such that the kernel of the bivector coincides with the ideal generated by the equations of motion
and the gauge fixing conditions. Obviously the Poisson structure thus
constructed on the algebra of functions on field configurations is not unique and depends on the above choice of coordinates; the same
non-uniqueness may be parametrized instead by a choice of a [[connection on a bundle|connection]] on the space of field configurations. The embedded covariant phase space becomes a leaf of the symplectic [[foliation]] of the space of field configurations.


## Examples

### Relativistic particle

The covarint phase space of the [[relativistic particle]] on a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]] $X$ is the space of [[geodesic]]s of $X$ (in the absence of a [[background gauge field]]).

### Chern-Simons theory

For [[Chern-Simons theory]] corresponding to a non-degenerate bilienear [[invariant polynomial]]
$\langle -,-\rangle$ on a [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ the 

* configuration space is the space $\Omega^1(\Sigma, \mathfrak{g})$ of [[Lie algebra valued forms]];

* covariant phase space is the space of field configurations $A$ whose [[curvature]] 2-form vanishes

  $$
    F_A = 0
  $$

* the [[presymplectic structure]] is

  $$
    \Omega(\delta A_1, \delta A_2) = 
   \int_{\Sigma_0} \langle \delta A_1 \wedge \delta A_2\rangle
    \,.
  $$

See [[Chern-Simons theory]] and [[schreiber:∞-Chern-Simons theory]] for more details.



### In dg-geometry

(...)

Let the ambient context be that of [[dg-geometry]]. Let $C$ be an ordinary [[smooth manifold]], assumed finite dimensional for the moment, and $\exp(i S) : C \to \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ an ordinary [[smooth function]] such that its 0-locus is an sub-manifold.

Then a presentation for the homotopy fiber of $\exp(i S)$ is given by the formal dual of the [[dg-algebra]]

$$
 (\wedge^{-\bullet}_{C^\infty(X)}\Gamma(T X), \iota_{(-)} d \exp(i S))
  =
 \left[
  \cdots \to \wedge_{C^\infty(X)}^2\Gamma(T X) \stackrel{{\iota_{(-)}d \exp(i S)}}{\to} \Gamma(T X) \stackrel{\iota_{(-)}d \exp(i S)}{\to} C^\infty(X) 
  \right]
$$

concentrated in non-positive degree, which in degree $k$ has the $k$th exterior powers of the [[tangent vector]]s of $X$ and whose differential is given by contracting a tangent vector with the 1-form $d \exp(i S)$.  

This is a [[Koszul resolution]]-type resolution of the 0-locus of $\exp(i S)$. More generally, the homotopy fiber is given by a [[Koszul-Tate resolution]]-type complex. This is known as the _antifield complex_ in the [[BV-BRST formalism|BV-BRST formulation]] of derived phase spaces.

## References


### Covariant phase space

A standard textbook reference is chapter 17.1 of 

* [[Marc Henneaux]], [[Claudio Teitelboim]], _[[Quantization of Gauge Systems]]_ , Princeton University Press 1992. xxviii+520 pp.

In the following we give a commented list of references following the hostorical development.

It seems that there have been two independent lines of development,
somewhat independent of each other, but also with some
crosspollination along the way. One stream [(P)](#ViaPoissonStructure) was concerned with the
construction of a [[Poisson structure]] on functions of solutions, while the other [(S)](#ViaSymplecticStructure) was concerned with the construction of a  [[symplectic form]]
on the space of solutions. Obviously, the differences between the two
kinds of constructions show up precisely in [[gauge theory]] systems.

The earliest papers are those of Peierls and
Bergmann-Schiller in the early 50's. They seem to have been
self-motivated. Below, we try to list papers that have established key results or have served as important popularizers together with their
main influences from previous works. The constructions of the (S)
stream seem to have appeared nearly independently several times over
several decades, until Lee-Wald and followups of Ashtekar's papers
became standard references. The (P) stream flowed slowly, but
consistently from original idea of Peierls. The papers of
Fredenhagen-Dütsch-et-al are a most readable modern formulation.

* R. Peierls, _The commutation laws of relativistic field theory_ (1952) ([jstor](http://www.jstor.org/pss/99080))

  (P)

  Influence: Appears to be self-motivated. The result may have been
guessed from the known unequal-time, covariant Poisson brackets
between free fields, which involve the causal Green function in an
explicit way.

  Result: The Peierls bracket on the covariant phase pace of a non-gauge system is defined and equivalence with the Hamiltonian phase space symplectic structure is proved. Gauge systems are treated by example of electrodynamics. The solution to degenerate equations of motion is either adding gauge fixing terms to the action or consider non-degenerate equations of motion satisfied by gauge invariant fields. Fermions are handled by multiplying fermi fields by formal odd parameters.

  (S)

  Influence: Appears to be motivated by Bergmann's long term and "brute force" analysis of the gauge invariance structure of relativity and structurally similar theories. Another motivation is the possibility of writing divergence-less stress energy tensors as "curls" of "superpotentials".

  Result: The pre-symplectic potential form-current makes an appearance. The definitions of the covariant phase space and the resulting symplectic form on it are obscure (at least to me), but later papers make reference to them.

  (P&S) 

  Influence: Peierls, Bergmann-Schiller

  Result: Proof of the equivalence between the Peierls bracket and the bracket obtained by Bergmann-Schiller for non-gauge systems. The
treatment of gauge systems and many of the calculations are maybe a  bit obscure.

  Influence: Bergmann-Schiller

  Result: Uses the methods of Bergmann-Schiller to define Poisson
brackets on initial data for linearized gravitational waves on null
hypersurfaces, including at null infinity.

  Influence: Peierls

  Result: A more detailed exposition of Peierls' idea, with a bit more generality in the treatment of gauge systems. Becomes a standard reference along with Peierls' original paper.

  Influence: Komar, also some more obscure papers by Fridmann and Palmer

  Result: Write down the explicit pre-symplectic current and the
corresponding pre-symplectic form on the space of solutions of
linearized gravitational wave equations. This symplectic form on the
reduced space of solutions is shown to coincide with the ADM
symplectic structure and with the Komar symplectic structure at null
infinity. The motivation explicit pre-symplectic current formula
appears from the desire to interpolate between the above two
formalisms.

  (S)

  Influence: Appears to be self-motivated. Witten needed a covariant way to define Poisson brackets from the action of open string field theory. Acknowledges parallel, independent work of Zuckerman.

  Result: Witten writes down the pre-symplectic form-current "by
inspection" for a scalar field and for a Chern-Simons theory, then he
explicitly shows that the current is conserved on the space of
solutions, and that its integral over a Cauchy surface is
variationally closed.
