## Idea

In one sense of the term, a _framing_ of a [[manifold]] is a choice of trivialization of its [[tangent bundle]], hence a choice of [[section]] of the corresponding [[frame bundle]]. 

A manifold that admits a framing is also called a **parallelizable manifold**. A manifold equipped with a framing is also called a **parallelized manifold**.

More generally, one means by a _framing_ not a trivialization of the tangent bundle itself, but

* of the [[normal bundle]] if the manifold is understood  [[embedding|embedded]] in some [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^d$

* of the _stable tangent bundle_.


Accordingly, a _framed cobordism_ is a [[cobordism]] equipped with a framing on the underlying manifold.

## Examples

###### Proposition

Every [[Lie group]] is a parallelizable manifold.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Every non-zero [[invariant vector field]] on the Lie group provides an everywhere non-vanishing section of the tangent bundle.

###### Proposition

Every [[orientation|orientable]] 3-[[dimension|dimensional]] [[manifold]] admits a framing.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

That a 3-manifold $X$  is orientable means that we have a [[reduction of the structure group]] of the tangent bundle to the [[special orthogonal group]], and hence the tangent bundle is classified by a map $X \to B SO(3)$. But since $SO(3)$ has vanishing [[homotopy groups]] in degree $0 \leq k \leq 2$. Therefore its [[delooping]] [[classifying space]] $B SO(3)$ has vanishing homotopy groups below degree 4 and hence every moprhism out of a 3-dimensional manifold into it is homotopically constant.

###### Theorem

The $n$-[[spheres]] that admit a framing are precisely only

* the 1-sphere $S^1$, the [[circle]] underlying the [[circle group]]

* the 3-sphere $S^3$, underlying the [[special unitary group]] $SU(2)$;

* the 7-sphere $S^7$.
