## Idea

In one sense of the term, a _framing_ of a [[manifold]] is a choice of trivialization of its [[tangent bundle]], hence a choice of [[section]] of the corresponding [[frame bundle]].

More generally, one means by a _framing_ not a trivialization of the tangent bundle itself, but

* of the [[normal bundle]] if the manifold is understood  [[embedding|embedded]] in some [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^d$

* of the _stable tangent bundle_.


Accordingly, a _framed cobordism_ is a [[cobordism]] equipped with a framing on the underlying manifold.
