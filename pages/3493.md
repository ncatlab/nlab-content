Marta Bunge reported at the category conference in Calais last june (2008) about her joint work with Claudio Hermida which is about some aspects of Diaconescu-type results in categorical dimension 2. Her slides from Calais can be found [here](http://saxo.univ-littoral.fr/CT08/slides/Bunge.pdf).  There are also some conjectural statements about higher n, with an interesting definition when an n-functor between strict n-categories should be called a  fibered n-category.
