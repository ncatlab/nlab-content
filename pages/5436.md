The area conventionally called [[applied mathematics]] is not in central focus of $n$Lab: our main focus is in (higher) category theory, [[sheaves]], [[stack]]s, [[homotopy theory|homotopy]] and (co)homological methods, foundations, [[topology]], [[algebra]] and modern geometry as well as mathematical physics and philosophical aspects. 

Unfortunately, there is a problem in defining what an applied mathematics is, and many mathematicians disagree about the range. Some including PoincarÃ© and Arnold said that 

> there is no applied mathematics, there are only applications of mathematics.

Moreover, in many areas and departments subdivision into pure and applied mathematics (or any of the similar variants) appears as a social designation, belong to a group rather than an imperative to applying anything to real world. 

One can argue that will be applied can not be nearly fully predicted by the area and intention of the creator of particular mathematical result, but by the internal power of the result and by the future of applications themselves. Hence it is a bit presumptious that people working on some particular mathematics problems, who do not themselves apply mathematics to real-life problems declare themselves applied just by the common opinion on classification of their result.

For instance it is common to assume that working on __partial differential equations__ (especially by analytic and numerical methods) is a subarea of applied mathematics, even if one studied completely unnatural and never applied differential equation, while it is not considered applied mathematics proving theorems about homology of spaces, even if they strongly influence index theorems widely used in applications to other sciences and "real-life problems".

In any case, to well-spirited people who believe they do applied mathematics we may vaguley recommend our moderately developed pages relating 

* [[mathematical physics]] 

which is important for us. Unfortunately, in the departments of applied mathematics world there is really any interest in foundations of [[quantum field theory]] (and siblings like [[superstring theory]], statistical field theory, quantum gravity...) which is our central interest in mathematical physics. We have stubs for some other areas intersecting with traditional "applied mathematics" but not much:

* [[hydrodynamics]], [[finite element method]], [[regular differential operator]], [[homological algebra in finite element method]]
