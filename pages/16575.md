## Idea

Generally, an _enhanced gauge symmetry_ refers to the appearance of [[gauge theory]] with a larger [[gauge group]] than may be superficially apparent.



### On coincident D-branes

A famous case is the enhanced gauge symmetry in the [[Chan-Paton gauge fields]] of coincident [[D-branes]]. A priori each D-brane carries a [[complex line bundle]]/[[circle principal bundle]], but as $n$ of them coincide the [[gauge group]] is expected to enhance from $(U(1))^n$ to the [[unitary group]] $U(n)$ (or the [[special unitary group]] $SU(n)$). 

Mathematically this gauge enhancement on D-branes is modeled by the [[Baum-Douglas geometric cycle]] model for [[K-homology]] ([Reis-Szabo 05, def. 1.5 and p. 16](#ReisSzabo05), [Szabo 08, p. 4](#Szabo08)): One such cycle is given by a submanifold $W \overset{\phi}{\hookrightarrow} X$ of [[spacetime]] $X$ equipped with [[spin^c structure]] and with a [[complex vector bundle]] $E \to X$, and given two such cycles $(W,\phi,E_1)$ and $(W,\phi,E_2)$ with the same underlying manifold ("coincident D-brane [[worldvolume]]") then their formal [[direct sum]] is identified with the single cycle carrying the [[direct sum of vector bundles]] 

$$
  (W,\phi, E_1) + (W, \phi, E_2)
  \;\sim\;
  (W, \phi, E_1 \oplus E_2)
  \,.
$$

If here $E_i$ has [[rank]] $n_i$ and hence [[structure group]] $U(n_i)$, then the [[direct sum of vector bundles]] $E_1 \oplus E_2$ has [[structure group]] the [[product group]] $U(n_1) \times U(n_2)$. 

In particular the sum of $n$ coincident cycles each carrying a line bundle yields a rank-$n$ vector bundle with structure group $(U(1))^n$. In this sense then a cycle carrying a general rank $n$-vector bundle, hence with structure group $U(n)$, may be thought of as a "gauge enhancement" of making $n$ D-branes coincide.


### From massless BPS states

In the context of the realization of [[super Yang-Mills theories]] as [[effective field theories]] of [[superstring theory]], [[BPS branes]] in the string background becomes BPS states of the SYM theory. These become massless as the [[cycles]] on which the BPS charge is supported shrink away (at boundary points of the given [[moduli space]]). In this case these additional massless states may appear as additional gauge bosons in the compactified gauge theory which thereby develops a larger gauge group. Typically a previously abelian gauge group becomes non-abelian this way.

Examples include [[KK-compactification]] of [[M-theory]] on [[K3]] fibers and on [[G2-manifolds]] with [[ADE singularities]], corresponding to [[F-theory]] on [[elliptic fibrations]] making [[K3]]-fibrations with singular fibers, corresponding to [[heterotic string theory]] on singular elliptic fibrations. See at

* _[[M-theory on G2-manifolds]]_ the section _[Nonabelian gauge groups and chiral fermions at orbifold singularities](M-theory+on+G2-manifolds#EnhancedGaugeGroups)_;

* _[[F-theory]]_ the section _[F-brane scan](F-theory#Fbranescan)_

* _[[duality between F-theory and heterotic string theory]]_.

### For MK6 branes at ADE-singularities

The [[blow-up]] of an [[ADE-singularity]] is given by a [[union]] of [[Riemann spheres]] that touch each other such as to form the shape of the [[Dynkin diagram]] whose A-D-E label corresponds to that of the given [[finite subgroup of SU(2)]].

This statement is originally due to ([duVal 1934 I, p. 1-3 (453-455)](#duVal1934I)). A description in terms of [[hyper-Kähler geometry]] is due to [Kronheimer 89a](#Kronheimer89a).

Quick survey of this fact is in [Reid 87](#Reid87), a textbook account is [Slodowy 80](#Slodowy80).

{#InStringTheory} In [[string theory]] this fact is interpreted in terms of [[gauge enhancement]] of the [[M-theory]]-lift of coincident [[black brane|black]] [[D6-branes]] to an  [[MK6]] at an ADE-singularity ([Sen 97](enhanced+gauge+symmetry#Sen97)):

See at _[[M-theory lift of gauge enhancement on D6-branes]]_ for more.


### On M9-Branes

In [[Horava-Witten theory]] there is supposed to be gauge enhancement over the [[M9-branes]] such as to identify their [[worldvolume]] theory with [[E8]]-[[heterotic string theory]]. 


Under the [[duality in string theory|duality]] between [[M-theory]] and [[type IIA string theory]] the M9-brane may be identified with the [[O8-plane]]:

This may be used to understand the [[gauge enhancement]] to [[E8]]-[[gauge groups]] at the [[heterotic string theory|heterotic]] boundary of [[Horava-Witten theory]]:
