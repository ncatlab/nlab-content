## Idea

A [[category]] $C$ is _closed_ if for any pair $a, b$ of [[objects]] the collection of [[morphisms]] from $a$ to $b$ can be regarded as forming itself an object of $C$.

This object is often denoted $hom(a,b)$ or $[a,b]$ or similar and often addressed as the _internal [[hom-object]]_ or simply the [[internal hom]].

A familiar kind of closed categories are [[closed monoidal category|closed monoidal categories]]. However, there is also a definition of **closed category** that does not require the category to already be monoidal.  A monoidal structure $\otimes$, if it exists, can then be universally characterized as a _left_ adjoint to the internal-hom, dual to the above characterization of internal-homs as right adjoints to $\otimes$.  See Eilenberg-Kelly, referenced below.

While this is less fashionable, in some cases it is more obvious what the correct internal-homs are than what the correct tensor product is, so the latter was originally defined as an adjoint to the former.  This is the case for the [[Gray tensor product]] and was probably the case for [[abelian group]]s as well.


## Definition

A **closed category** is a [[category]] $C$ together with the following data:

* A [[functor]] $[-,-] : C^{op} \times C \to C$, called the [[internal hom]]-functor.
* An [[object]] $I\in C$ called the *[[unit object]]*.
* A [[natural isomorphism]] $i\colon Id_C \cong [I,-]$.
* A transformation $j_X\colon I \to [X,X]$, [[extranatural]] in $X$.
* A transformation $L^X_{Y Z} \colon  [Y,Z] \to [[X,Y],[X,Z]]$, natural in $Y$ and $Z$ and extranatural in $X$.

which is required to satisfy the following axioms.

* The following [[diagram]] commutes for any $X,Y$.

  $$\array{I & \overset{j_Y}{\to} & [Y,Y]\\
  & _{\mathllap{j_{[X,Y]}}}\searrow & \downarrow^{L^X_{Y Y}}\\
  & & [[X,Y],[X,Y]]}$$

* The following diagram commutes for any $X,Y$.

  $$\array{[X,Y] & \overset{L^X_{X Y}}{\to} & [[X,X],[X,Y]]\\
  & _{\mathllap{i_{[X,Y]}}}\searrow & \downarrow^{[j_X,1]}\\
  & & [I,[X,Y]]}$$

* The following diagram commutes for any $Y,Z$.

  $$\array{[Y,Z] & \overset{L^I_{Y Z}}{\to} & [[I,Y],[I,Z]]\\
  & _{\mathllap{[1,i_Z]}}\searrow & \downarrow^{[i_Y,1]}\\
  & & [Y,[I,Z]]}$$

* The following diagram commutes for any $X,Y,U,V$.

  $$\array{[U,V] & \overset{L^Y_{U V}}{\to} & [[Y,U],[Y,V]]\\
  ^{L^X_{U V}}\downarrow && \\
  [[X,U],[X,V]] & &  \downarrow^{[1,L^X_{Y V}]} \\
  ^{L^{[X,Y]}_{[X,U],[X,V]}}\downarrow && \\
  [[[X,Y],[X,U]],[[X,Y],[X,V]]] & \underset{[L^X_{Y U},1]}{\to} & [[Y,U],[[X,Y],[X,V]]]}$$

* Finally, the map $\gamma\colon C(X,Y) \to C(I,[X,Y])$ defined by $f \mapsto [1,f](j_X)$ is a [[bijection]].

This definition is from Manzyuk's paper below.  It differs slightly from Eilenberg-Kelly's original definition, which omitted $\gamma$ but assumed an "underlying-set-functor" $U\colon C \to Set$ as part of the structure, with an axiom asserting that $U([X,Y]) = C(X,Y)$ and that the resulting isomorphism
$$ C(X,X) = U([X,X]) \overset{U i_{[X,X]}}{\to} U([I,[X,X]]) = C(I,[X,X]) $$
sends $1_X$ to $j_X$.  The two are essentially equivalent, and the one given here is perhaps a little simpler.

+-- {: .query}
[[Tobias Fritz]]: I suspect there is a variant of the definition involving a transformation $R^Z_{X Y} \colon  [X,Y] \to [[Y,Z],[X,Z]]$ rather than $L$. Is this correct? If so, how do these two definitions relate? Can one of them be expressed in terms of the other? Or is there a refined definition which comprises both $L$ and $R$?

## Examples

* Any [[closed monoidal category]] gives a closed category, by simply forgetting the tensor product and remembering only the internal-hom.  Most examples seem to be of this sort, although as remarked above it is often the case that the closed structure is "primary" and the tensor product is defined as a [[left adjoint]] to it. Notice also, as discussed [below](#EmbedIntoCloseMon) that every closed category arises as the full [[subcategory]] of a closed monoidal category.

* Any [[multicategory]] which has a unit, i.e. an object $I$ such that $C(;Y) \cong C(I;Y)$ naturally, and is closed in the sense that for any $Y,Z$ there is an object $[Y,Z]$ with natural isomorphisms $C(X_1,\dots,X_n,Y;Z) \cong C(X_1,\dots,X_n; [Y,Z])$, gives rise to a closed category.  Conversely, from any closed category we can construct a multicategory of this sort, by defining the multimaps as $C(X_1,\dots,X_n; Z) = C(X_1, [X_2,\dots,[X_n,Z]])$.  Thus closed categories are essentially equivalent to closed unital multicategories.


## Properties

### Embedding into closed monoidal categories {#EmbedIntoCloseMon}

By a result due to Miguel LaPlaza, every closed category embeds [[full and faithful functor|fully and faithfully]] into a [[closed monoidal category]] by a strong [[closed functor]], i.e., one respecting closed structure up to suitably coherent isomorphism, and this closed functor is also strong monoidal if the original closed category is closed monoidal.


### Monadicity and 2-categories

Since the notion of closed category involves a contravariant functor and extranatural transformations, it cannot be expected to be [[2-monad|2-monadic]] over the [[2-category]] [[Cat]].  It is, however, 2-monadic over the 2-category $Cat_g$ of categories, functors, and natural isomorphisms, the [[core]] of [[Cat]].  In this way we obtain a 2-category $ClCat$ of closed categories, strong [[closed functors]], and [[closed natural transformations]].  One can also define a notion of non-strong, or "lax," closed functor; although these do not seemingly arise from the 2-monad in question, they generalize lax monoidal functors between closed monoidal categories.
