## Idea

A quiver is a collection of edges which may stretch between (ordered) pairs of "points", called _vertices_.

A quiver is like a [[category]] with units and composition forgotten. Indeed, a [[category]] is a quiver with extra structure.  To formalize this idea, we say there is a [[forgetful functor]] 

$$U\colon Cat \to Quiv$$

where [[Quiv]] is the category of quivers and [[Cat]] is the category of ([[small category|small]] [[strict category|strict]]) categories.  Moreover, this forgetful functor has a [[left adjoint]] 

$$F\colon Quiv \to Cat $$

sending each quiver to the [[free category]] on that quiver.

A quiver is a kind of [[graph]] and is often called a [[directed graph]] (or [[digraph]]) by category theorists.  However, in the context of graph theory, the term "directed graph" is often taken to mean that there is at most one edge from one vertex to another. See [[directed graph]].


## Definitions

### Slick definition

The **[[walking structure|walking]] quiver** $X$ is the [[category]] with

* one [[object]] $X_0$, called the object of _vertices_;

* one object $X_1$, called the object of _edges_;

* two [[morphisms]] $s, t\colon X_1 \to X_0$, called
the _source_ and _target_;

* together with [[identity morphisms]].

A **quiver** is a [[functor]] $G\colon X \to$ [[Set]].

More generally, a **quiver [[internalization|in]] a category $C$** is a [[functor]] $G\colon X \to C$.

The category of quivers in $C$, [[Quiv]]$(C)$, is the [[functor category]] $C^{X}$, where:

* objects are functors $G\colon X \to C$,

* morphisms are [[natural transformation|natural transformations]] between such functors.

In the basic case $C = Set$, we call this category the category of [[presheaves]] on $X^{op}$.  So: the category of quivers, [[Quiv]], is the category of presheaves on the category $X^{op}$.


### Nuts-and-bolts definitions 

A __quiver__ $G$ consists of two sets $E$ (the set of _edges_ of $G$), $V$ (the set of _vertices_ of $G$) and two functions 

$$s, t\colon E \stackrel{\to}{\to} V$$ 

(the source and target functions). More generally, a __quiver internal to a category__ (more simply, *in* a category) $C$ consists of two objects $E$, $V$ and two morphisms $s, t\colon E \to V$. 

If $G = (E, V, s, t)$ and $G' = (E', V', s', t')$ are two quivers in a category $C$, a __morphism__ $g\colon G \to G'$ is a pair of morphisms $g_0\colon V \to V'$, $g_1\colon E \to E'$ such that $s' \circ g_1 = g_0 \circ s$ and $t' \circ g_1 = g_0 \circ t$. 


## Remarks

Let $G_0 = G(X_0)$ and $G_1 = G(X_1)$.

* A quiver in $C$ is a [[presheaf]] on $X^{op}$ with values in $C$.

* A quiver is a [[globular set]] which is concentrated in the first two degrees.

* Quivers in the sense here include graphs with distinct edges $e,e'\in G_1$ such that $s(e) = s(e')$ and $t(e) = t(e')$, as well as loops, i.e. edges with $s(e) = t(e)$.

* A quiver is **[[complete graph|complete]]** if for any pair of vertices $v,v'\in G_0$, there exists a unique directed edge $e\in G_1$ with $s(e) = v, t(e) = v'$.


## Terminology

Saying _quiver_ instead of _directed (multi)graph_ indicates focus on a certain set of operation intended on that graph. Notably there is the notion of a [[quiver representation]].

Now, one sees that a _representation_ of a graph $G$ in the sense of quiver representation is nothing but a [[functor]] $\rho\colon Q := F(G) \to Vect$ from the _free category_ $F(G)$ on the quiver $G$:

Given a graph $G$ with collection of vertices $G_0$ and collection of edges $G_1$, there is the free category $F(G)$ on the graph whose collection of objects coincides with the collection of vertices, and whose collection of morphisms consists of finite [[sequence]]s of edges in $G$ that fit together head-to-tail (also known as _[[path]]s_). The composition operation in this free category is the concatenation of sequences of edges.

Here we are taking advantage of the [[adjoint functor|adjunction]] between [[Cat]] (the category of small categories) and [[Quiv]] (the category of directed graphs).  Namely, any category has an underlying directed graph:

$$U\colon Cat \to Quiv$$

and the left adjoint of this functor gives the free category on a directed graph:

$$F\colon Quiv\to Cat $$

Since this is the central operation on quivers that justifies their distinction from the plain concept of directed graph, we may adopt here the point of view that _quiver_ is synonymous with _free category_.

So a [[representation]] of a quiver $Q = F(G)$ is a functor

$$R\colon Q \to Vect $$

Concretely, such a thing assigns a vector space to each vertex of the graph $G$, and a linear operator to each edge.  Representations of quivers are fascinating things, with connections to ADE theory, quantum groups, string theory, and more.


## Identifying quivers with free categories

It may be handy to *identify* a quiver with its free category.  This can be justified in the sense that the functor $F\colon Quiv \to Cat$ is an embedding ($k$-[[k-surjectivity|surjective]] for all $k \gt 0$) on the [[cores]].  In other words, [[isomorphisms]] between quivers may be identified with [[equivalence of categories|equivalences]] between free categories with no ambiguity.

However, at the level of noninvertible morphisms, this doesn\'t work; while $U$ is [[faithful functor|faithful]], it is *not* [[full functor|full]].  In other words, there are many [[functors]] between free categories that are not morphisms of quivers.

Nevertheless, if we fix a quiver $G$ and a category $D$, then a [[quiver representation|representation]] of $G$ in $D$ is precisely a functor from $F(G)$ to $D$ (or equivalently a quiver morphism from $G$ to $U(D)$), and we may well want to think of this as being a morphism (a [[heteromorphism]]) from $G$ to $D$.  As long as $D$ is not itself a free category, this is unlikely to cause confusion.


## Link to representation theory of algebras

For $Q$ a quiver, write $k Q$ for the path algebra of $Q$
over a ground field $k$.  Now $k Q$ is an algebra with $k$-basis given by finite composable sequences of arrows in $Q$, including a "lazy path" of
length zero at each vertex.  

A module over $k Q$ is the same thing as a representation of $Q$, so the theory of representations of quivers can be viewed within the broader context of representation theory of (associative) algebras.  

If $Q$ is acyclic, then $k Q$ is finite-dimensional as a vector space, so in studying representations of $Q$, we are really studying representations of a finite dimensional algebra, for which many interesting tools exist 
(Auslander-Reiten theory, tilting, etc.).

he defines a quiver as a [[directed graph]]. Then it seems like the [[quiver algebra|path algebra]] is the category generated by the quiver. It seems the literature might be inconsistent in the naming conventions? Perhaps we need to settle the convention for nLab.

The wikipedia page also defines a quiver as a [[directed graph]]. It has a blurb about a categorical definition, but it doesn't seem to be consistent with the previous definition (?)

_[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]] says_: You are right, Eric, I think John "played Bourbaki" a bit when he wrote the above. I have added a comment in an attempt to clarify the situation.

_[[John Baez|John]] says_: Yes, I played Bourbaki, trying to add some clarity to the usual treatment of quivers by recognizing that what people always _do_ with quivers is treat them as the free categories on directed graphs!  And after all, if you _don't_ want to take the free category on your directed graph, why bother calling it a 'quiver'?  You might as well call it a 'directed graph'!  

In short, my definition fits what people actually do with quivers, and saves 'quiver' from being a redundant synonym for 'directed graph'.   

By the way, quivers are called 'quivers' because they're a [bunch of arrows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiver).

The Wikipedia entry on [the mathematics of quivers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiver_%28mathematics%29) says that a categorical definition of quiver can be given, but doesn't actually give it: it says a quiver can be considered as a category, but it doesn't say precisely which kind of category.  But, people know which kind: a free category on a directed graph.

Also by the way, I've moved this down here because I imagine many pages on the $n$Lab will gradually acquire long and interesting discussions which we don't want stuck right in the middle of the main stuff.  Wikipedia has 'talk pages' for this purpose.

I removed the green 'query' box, which gets a bit inconvenient when the discussion gets long. But, it might be nice to have this sort of discussion be visibly different from the main article.

[[Eric Forgy|Eric]] says: What if we create a separate page called **Discussion: quiver** and link to it from here? Or something... 

[[Hugh Thomas|Hugh]] says: It is hard to defend Gabriel's original choice to introduce the term "quiver" instead of talking about directed graphs.  Nonetheless, the term having existed for more than thirty years as a synonym for "directed graph", it seems to me that it would only cause confusion to try to change the definition now.  

Let me emphasize that it really is used as a synonym -- it doesn't necessarily carry the implication that the representations of the graph are going to be considered.  For example, representation theorists talk about the AR-quiver of a category all the time, and they hardly ever mean that they want to consider the representation theory of that quiver.

Edited to add: sorry, I wouldn't have bothered saying this if I'd noticed that the definition had already been changed!

_Toby_:  I\'m inclined to rename this page to [[free category]] or [[free category on a quiver]].

Zoran: If we are going to talk free categories instead than one should be aware that some books (e.g. Gabriel-Zisman) say path category instead of free category. As far as quivers, what about "quivers with relations" ?

_Toby_:  We have another meaning of [[path category]], but that is a good term.

_Harry_: Hugh, that is the incorrect definition of a directed graph.  Our definition here of directed graph is actually the definition of a multidigraph, or a directed multigraph, which is the definition of a quiver!
