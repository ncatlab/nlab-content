
In the context of [[cofibrantly generated model category]] theory one says that a collection $I$ of [[morphism]]s in a [[category]] $C$ with [[colimit]]s is _saturated_ or _weakly saturated_ if it is closed under the operations of forming:
* [[pushout]]s

* [[transfinite composition]]

* [[retract]]s (in the [[arrow category]] $Arr(C)$)

[[!redirects weakly saturated class of morphisms]]
