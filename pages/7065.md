# Contractible types

## Idea

In [[homotopy type theory]], the notion of **contractible [[type]]** is an internalization of the notion of [[contractible space]] / [[(-2)-truncated]] object.

Contractible types are also called of **[[h-level]] $0$**. They represent the notion _[[true]]_ in homotopy type theory.


## Definition

We work in [[intensional type theory|intensional]] [[type theory]] with [[dependent sums]], [[dependent products]], and [[identity types]], 

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For $X$ a [[type]], let

$$
  isContr(X) \coloneqq \sum_{x\colon X} \prod_{y\colon X} (y=x)
$$

be the [[dependent sum]] in one [[variable]] $x : X$ over the [[dependent product]] on the other [[variable]] $y \colon X$ of the $x,y$-[[dependent type|dependent]] [[identity type]] $(x = y)$.

We say that $X$ is a **contracrible type** if $isContr(X)$ is an [[inhabited type]].

###### Remark

In [[propositions as types]] language, this can be pronounced as "there exists a point $x\colon X$ such that every other point $y\colon X$ is equal to $x$."  

Under the [[homotopy theory|homotopy-theoretic]] interpretation, it should be thought of as the type of *contractions* of $X$ --- since the dependent product describes *continuous* functions, the paths from $y$ to $x$ depend continuously on $y$ and thus exhibit a contraction of $X$ to $x$.

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

A provably [[equivalence in homotopy type theory|equivalent]] definition is
the [[product type]] of $X$ with the [[isProp]]-type of $X$:

$$
  isContr(X) \coloneqq X \;\times\; isProp(X) 
  \,.
$$

=--

(Here of course we have to use a definition of [[isProp]] which doesn't refer to $isContr$).  

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

This now says that $X$ is contractible iff $X$ is [[inhabited type|inhabited]] and an [[h-proposition]].

## Properties

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition


For any type $A$, the type $isContr(A)$ is an [[h-proposition]].  In particular, we can show $isContr(A) \to isContr(isContr(A))$: if a type is contractible, then its space of contractions is also contractible.

###### Proposition

A type is contractible if and only if it is [[equivalence in homotopy type theory|equivalent]] to the [[unit type]].

## Categorical semantics
 {#CategoricalSemantics}

We discuss the [[categorical semantics]] of contractible types.

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[locally cartesian closed category]] with [[presentation of homotopy type theory|sufficient structure]] to intepret all the above type theory.  This means that $C$ has a [[weak factorization system]] with [[stable path objects]], and that [[acyclic cofibrations]] are preserved by pullback along fibrations between fibrant objects.  (We ignore questions of [[coherence]], which are not important for this discussion.)

Then for a [[fibrant object]] $A$, the fibrant object $isContr(A)$ is obtained by taking the dependent product of the path-object $A^I \to A\times A$ along one projection $A\times A\to A$ (then forgetting the remaining map to $A$).

This means that to give a [[global element]] of $isContr(A)$ is to give a global element $a\colon 1\to A$ together with a right [[homotopy]] relating the composite $A\to 1\to A$ to the identity.  Thus, $A\to 1$ is a (right) [[homotopy equivalence]], and hence (since $A$ is [[fibrant]]) an [[acyclic fibration]].

Conversely, if $\mathcal{C}$ is a model category, $A$ and $1$ are cofibrant, and $A\to 1$ is an acyclic fibration, then $A\to 1$ is a right homotopy equivalence, and hence $isContr(A)$ has a global element.  Thus, in most cases, the existence of a global element of $isContr(A)$ (which is unique up to homotopy, since $isContr(A)$ is an [[h-proposition]]) is equivalent to $A\to 1$ being an acyclic fibration.

More generally, we may apply this locally.  Suppose that $A\to B$ is a fibration, which we can regard as a dependent type
$$x\colon B \vdash A(x)\colon Type.$$
Then we have a dependent type
$$x\colon B \vdash isContr(A(x))\colon Type$$
represented by a fibration $isContr(A)\to B$.  By applying the above argument in the [[slice category]] $\mathcal{C}/B$, we see that (if $\mathcal{C}$ is a model category, and $A$ and $B$ are cofibrant) $isContr(A)\to B$ has a [[section]] exactly when $A\to B$ is an acyclic fibration.

We can also construct the type
$$\prod_{x\colon B} isContr(A(x))$$
in global context, which has a global element precisely when $isContr(A)\to B$ has a section.  Thus, a global element of this type is also equivalent to $A\to B$ being an acyclic fibration.
