## Idea

In [[philosophy]], the statement that given any $A$, then $A$ [[equality|equals]] $A$

$$
  A = A
$$

(i.e. [[reflexive relation|reflexivity]]) has been called (see the [references below](#References)) the _first law of thought_. 

In terms of [[type theory]] this is the [[judgement]] that exhibits the [[term introduction]] for the [[reflexive relation|reflector]] in an [[identity type]]

$$
  A \colon Type \;\vdash\; refl_A \;\colon A = A\;
  \,.
$$

In fact, [[identity types]] may be regarded as [[inductive types]] generated by just this [[reflexive relation|reflector]] ([Licata 11](#Licata11), [Shulman 12,  slide 35](#Shulman12), see [there](identity+type#InTermsOfInductiveTypes)).

calls $A = A$   "[den ersten, schlechthin unbedingent Grundsatz](Grundlage+der+gesamten+Wissenschaftslehre#ErsterGrundsatz)" hence the "absolutely imperative principle". (In fact Fichte there highlights the importance of the [[antecedent]] $A \colon Type$ to arrive at the [[consequent]] $A = A$.)
