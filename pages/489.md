## Definition

A __$(-1)$-groupoid__ is a [[truth value]], or equivalently an [[n-truncated object of an (infinity,1)-category|(−1)-truncated object]] in [[∞Grpd]].  By [[excluded middle]], this is either [[the]] empty groupoid (false) or the [[terminal category|terminal groupoid]] (true, the [[point]]).


## Remarks

Compare the concept of [[0-groupoid]] (a [[set]]) and [[(−2)-groupoid]] (which is trivial). The point of $(-1)$-groupoids is that they complete some patterns in the [[periodic table]] of $n$-categories. (They also shed light on the theory of [[homotopy group]]s and [[n-stuff]].)

For example, there should be a $0$-[[0-category|category]] of $(-1)$-groupoids; a $0$-category is also a set, and this set is the set of [[truth value|truth values]]: classically
$$
  (-1)Grpd := \{\bot, \top\}
$$

Actually, since for other values of $n$, [[n-groupoid]]s form not just an $(n+1)$-category but an $(n+1,1)$-category, we should expect the $0$-category of $(-1)$-groupoids to be a $(0,1)$-category, or $1$-[[1-poset|poset]].  This simply means a [[partial order|poset]], and indeed truth values do always form a poset, classically ($\bot \leq \top$).

If we equip the category of $(-1)$-groupoids with the [[monoidal category|monoidal structure]] of [[logical conjunction|conjunction]] (the logical AND operation), then a [[enriched category|groupoid enriched]] over this is a [[equivalence relation|setoid]], and a category enriched over it is a [[preorder|proset]].  Up to [[equivalence of categories]], these are the same as a [[set]] (a $0$-[[0-groupoid|groupoid]]) and a [[partial order|poset]] (a (0,1)-[[1-poset|category]]); this fits the patterns of the periodic table.

See [[(−1)-category]] for more on this sort of [[negative thinking]].
