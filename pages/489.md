A __(-1)-groupoid__ is a [[truth value]]. Compare the concept of [[0-groupoid]] (a [[set]]) and [[(-2)-groupoid]] (which is trivial). The point of (-1)-groupoids is that they complete some patterns in the [[periodic table]] of $n$-categories. (They also shed light on the theory of [[homotopy group]]s and [[n-stuff]].)

For example, there should be a $0$-[[0-category|category]] of $(-1)$-groupoids; a $0$-category is also a set, and this set is the set of [[truth value|truth values]]: classically
$$
  (-1)Grpd := \{\bot, \top\}
$$
Actually, since for other values of $n$, $n$-groupoids form not just an $(n+1)$-category but an $(n+1,1)$-category, we should expect the $0$-category of $(-1)$-groupoids to be a $(0,1)$-category, or $1$-[[poset]].  This simply means a [[poset]], and indeed truth values do always form a poset, classically ($\bot \leq \top$).

If we equip the category of $(-1)$-groupoids with the monoidal structure of [[conjunction]] (the logical AND operation), then a [[enriched category|groupoid enriched]] over this is an [[equivalence relation]], and a category enriched over it is a [[preorder]].  Up to [[equivalence of categories]], these is the same as a [[set]] (a $0$-[[0-groupoid|groupoid]]) and a [[poset]] (a (0,1)-[[1-poset|category]]); this fits the patterns of the periodic table.

See [[(-1)-category]] for more on this sort of 'negative thinking'.
