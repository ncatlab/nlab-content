## Idea

Calorons are topologically non-trivial [[field (physics)|field]]-configurations in [[Yang-Mills theory]] at [[thermal field theory|positive temperature]] $T \gt 0$. They correspond to what at vanishing [[temperature]] $T =  0$ are called [[instantons]], specifically [[BPST instantons]] (but there is no continuous limit relating the two).

While the physical reality of [[instantons]] is at best subtle (they are interpreted as witnessing [[quantum tunneling]] between actual [[vacua]]) calorons are meant to correspond to actual [[vacua]] of [[Yang-Mills theory]] at [[thermal field theory|positive temperature]], reflecting the general statement that [[Wick rotation]] has good physical meaning at positive temperature.

More in detail:

Upon [[Wick rotation]], $G$-[[Yang-Mills theory]] on [[Minkowski spacetime]] $\mathbb{R}^{3,1}$ in a [[KMS state]] of [[positive number|positive]] [[temperature]] $T$ is expressed by [[Euclidean field theory]] on the [[Riemannian manifold]] $\mathbb{R}^3 \times S^1_{\beta}$, where the first factor is 3-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] and the second factor is a [[circle]] of [[length]] $\beta \coloneqq 1/T$ (proportional to) the inverse [[temperature]].

A _caloron_ is a [[gauge field]]-configuration in this Euclidean Yang-Mills theory on $\mathbb{R}^3 \times S^1_\beta$ [[vanishing at infinity]]. By the [[clutching construction]] the topological class of these bundles (their [[second Chern class]] for [[gauge group]] a  [[simple Lie group]]) is given by [[homotopy classes]] of maps

$$
  S^2 \times S^1 \longrightarrow G
$$

hence

$$
  S^3 \times S^1 \longrightarrow B G
$$

For the case $G = $ [[special unitary group|SU(2)]] $\simeq S^3$ and via the usual math/physics translation of terminology ([here](BPTS-instanton#FromTheMathsToThePhysicsStory)) this was first considered in [Harrington-Shepard 77, p. 3](#HarringtonShepard77), and baptized a "caloron"-configuration in [Harrington-Shepard 78, p. 1](#HarringtonShepard78).

A further refinement of the construction included the nonzero [[vacuum expectation value]] $\langle (A_4)^3\rangle$ of the "time" component of the [[vector potential]], called the _KvBLL caloron_ ([Kraan-van Baal 98a](#KraanVanBaal98a), [Kraan-van Baal 98b](#KraanVanBaal98b), [Lee-Lu 98](#LeeLu98)).

This solution revealed the substructure: it  gets  split  into $N_c$ (number  of  colors)  separate  (anti)self- dual  3d  solitons  with  nonzero  (Euclidean)  electric  and  magnetic charges (see e.g. [Larsen-Shuryak 14](#LarsenShuryak14)).




## Properties

### Relation to confinement
 {#RelationToConfinement}

As part of a possible solution to the [[confinement]]/[[mass gap]]-problem:

[Greensite 11, section 8.5](#Greensite11):

> it is natural to wonder if [[confinement]] could be derived from some [[semiclassical approximation|semiclassical]] treatment of [[Yang–Mills theory]] based on the [[instanton]] solutions of [[nonabelian group|non-abelian]] [[gauge theories]]. The [[BPST instanton|standard]] [[instantons]], introduced by Belavin et al. ([40](BPTS-instanton#BelavinPolyakovSchwartzTyupkin75)), do not seem to work; their [[field strengths]] fall off too rapidly to produce the desired  magnetic  disorder in the vacuum.  

> In  recent  years,  however, it has been realized that instanton solutions at [[thermal field theory|finite temperature]], known as _calorons_, might do the job. These caloron solutions were introduced independently by Kraan and van Baal  ([41](#KraanVanBaal98), [42](#KraanVanBaal98b)) and Lee and Lu  ([43](#LeeLu98)) (KvBLL), and they have the remarkable property of containing [[monopole]] constituents which may, depending on the type of caloron, be widely separated.

> $[...]$

> The caloron idea is probably the most promising current version of [[monopole]] [[confinement]] in pure non-abelian gauge theories, but it is  basically  (in certain [[gauge fixing|gauges]]) a superposition of [[monopoles]] with spherically  symmetric abelian fields, and this leads to the same questions raised in connection with monopole Coulomb gases.

## History

The paper [Harrington-Shepard 1978](#Harrington-Shepard_78) considers the contribution from periodic solutions at _positive, finite_ temperature to the [[Yang-Mills equations]] to the action of a 'Yang-Mills gas': an equilibrium ensemble of YM fields. They give explicit solutions to the classical equations of motion 'of charge 1' i.e. representing a generator in the [[homotopy group]] classifying topologically inequivalent solutions. 


[[Werner Nahm|Nahm]] ([Nahm 1984](#Nahm_84)) continued the study of calorons, linking them with self-dual [[monopoles]] and the [[ADHM construction]].
