## Idea

In [[physics]] the symmetric [[tensor algebra]] on a [[space of quantum states]] of some [[quantum mechanical system]] is called its _bosonic Fock space_. This is regarded in turn as the space of [[quantum states]] of arbitrarily many copies of the system. In particular if the original system describes some [[boson|bosonic]] [[particle]] species, then its Fock space is the space of quantum states of arbitrarily many such particles.

Similarly the [[exterior algebra]]/[[Grassmann algebra]] is called the _[[fermion|fermionic]] [[Fock space]]_.

The process of passing from a given [[space of quantum states]] to its Fock space is also known as (or rather: is part of) what is called _[[second quantization]]_. 

Fock spaces hence appear as [[spaces of quantum states]] of [[free fields]] in [[quantum field theory]]. In [[perturbative quantum field theory]] they are still used indirectly in for non-free field theories.

The Fock space construction may be axiomatized as the [[exponential modality]] in [[linear type theory]]. This is discussed in the following articles.
