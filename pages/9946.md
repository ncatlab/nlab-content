## Idea

Recall that a (say [[real number|real]]-valued) [[function]] $f$ is [[continuous map|continuous]] if, roughly speaking, $f(x) \approx f(y)$ (meaning that $f(x)$ is close to $f(y)$) whenever $x \approx y$.  For a _lower_ semicontinuous map, we require only $f(x) \gtrsim f(y)$ (meaning that $f(x)$ is close to or greater than $f(y)$); for an _upper_ semicontinuous map, we require only $f(x) \lesssim f(y)$.


## Definitions

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]], let $R$ be a [[linearly ordered set]], and let $f$ be a [[function]] from $X$ to $R$.

In [[nonstandard analysis]], the vague idea above becomes a precise definition, so long as we use the appropriate [[quantification|quantifiers]] for $x$ and $y$.

###### Definition

The function $f$ is __lower semicontinuous__ if, for each [[standard point]] $x$ of $X$ and each [[hyperpoint]] $y$ in the [[infinitesimal neighbourhood]] of $x$, $f(y)$ is either greater than or in the infinitesimal neighbourhood of $f(x)$.  Similarly, $f$ is __upper semicontinuous__ if, for each standard point $x$ of $X$ and each hyperpoint $y$ in the [[infinitesimal neighbourhood]] of $x$, $f(y)$ is either less than or in the infinitesimal neighbourhood of $f(x)$.

In [[classical analysis]], we must phrase this another way:
+-- {: .num_defn #standard}
###### Definition

The function $f$ is __lower semicontinuous__ if, for each [[point]] $x$ of $X$ and each $a \lt f(x)$ in $L$, there is some [[neighbourhood]] $U$ of $x$ such that, for each $y \in U$, $f(y) \gt a$.  Similarly, $f$ is __upper semicontinuous__ if, for each point $x$ of $X$ and each $b \gt f(x)$ in $L$, there is some neighbourhood $U$ of $x$ such that, for each $y \in U$, $f(y) \lt b$.
=--

We can also refer to an appropriate [[topological structure]] on $L$:
+-- {: .num_defn #continuous}
###### Definition

The function $f$ is __lower semicontinuous__ if it is [[continuous function|continuous]] from $X$ to $L$ with the [[semicontinuous topology|lower semicontinuous topology]].  Similarly, $f$ is __upper semicontinuous__ if it is continuous from $X$ to $L$ with the [[semicontinuous topology|upper semicontinuous topology]].

Of course, this doesn\'t really say anything if you don\'t know what those topologies on $L$ are, and the easiest way to figure that out is to refer to Definition \ref{standard} (or to Definition \ref{nonstandard} if you know enough nonstandard analysis to interpret it).


## Examples

A function is [[continuous function|continuous]] (with respect to the usual [[order topology]] on $L$) iff it is both upper and lower semicontinuous.

The [[characteristic function]] of a [[subset]] $A$ (either valued in the [[poset]] of [[truth values]] with its usual order or valued in the [[real numbers]] with $1$ for true and $0$ for false) is lower semicontinuous iff $A$ is [[open subset|open]], upper semicontinuous iff $A$ is [[closed subset|closed]], and continuous iff $A$ is [[clopen subset|clopen]].


## Generalizations

We need to say something about when $L$ is a [[dcpo]] or something like that (involving the [[Scott topology]]), as well as semicontinuity in [[constructive mathematics]] involving [[locales]].  Compare also the [[one-sided real numbers]].
