_under construction_

## Idea

The Gelfand-Naimark-Segal (GNS) construction establishes a correspondence between cyclic *-representations of [[C*-algebras]] and certain linear functionals (usually called _states_) on those same C*-algebras.  The correspondence comes about from an explicit construction of the [[*-representation]] from one of the [[linear functionals]] (states).

###### Theorem

Given a state, $\rho$, on some C*-algebra, $A$, there is a *-representation $\pi$ of $A$ with a cyclic vector $\xi$ whose associated state is $\rho$.  In other words,

$$
  \rho(x)= \langle \xi, \pi(x)\xi \rangle
$$

for every $x$ in $A$.
