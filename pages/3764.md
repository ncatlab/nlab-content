## Idea

The Gelfand--Naimark--Segal (GNS) construction establishes a correspondence between cyclic $*$-[[representation]]s of $C^*$-[[C*-algebra|algebras]] and certain linear functionals (usually called _states_) on those same $C^*$-algebras.  The correspondence comes about from an explicit construction of the [[star-representation|*-representation]] from one of the [[linear functionals|linear functionals]] (states).


## The nPOV

The GNS construction (as outlined above) is a special case of a more general construction of Ghez, Lima and Roberts applied to $C^\ast$-categories (horizontal categorification of $C\ast$-algebras).

###### Theorem

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a $C*$-category. Fix an object $A \in \operatorname{Ob}\mathcal{C}$ and let $\sigma$ be a state on the $C*$-algebra $\mathcal{C}(A,A)$. Then there exists a $*$-representation
$$
\rho_\sigma \colon \mathcal{C} \to \mathbf{Hilb}
$$
together with a cyclic vector $\xi \in \rho_\sigma(A)$ such that for all $x \in \mathcal{C}(A,A)$,
$$
\sigma(x) = \langle \xi, \rho_\sigma(x)\xi \rangle.
$$

## The Classical Case

A $C*$-algebra $A$ is a $C*$-category $\mathcal{A}$ with one object $\bullet$, where we make the identification $A = \mathcal{A}(\bullet,\bullet)$. In this case the theorem reduces to the classical GNS construction.

###### Theorem

Given a [[states in AQFT and operator algebra|state]], $\rho$, on some [[C*-algebra]], $A$, there is a $*$-[[representation]] $\pi$ of $A$ with a [[cyclic vector]] $\xi$ whose associated state is $\rho$.  In other words,

$$
  \rho(x)= \langle \xi, \pi(x)\xi \rangle
$$

for every $x$ in $A$.

## Applications

The GNS construction is a central ingredient that translates between the [[Heisenberg picture]] and the [[Schrödinger picture]] of [[quantum mechanics]]: the [[AQFT]] and the [[FQFT]] picture of [[quantum field theory]]. In the former one considers $C^\ast$-[[algebras of observables]], in the latter the [[spaces of states]]. Given a $C^\ast$-algebra of observables, the corresponding space of state can be taken to be that given by the GNS construction.
