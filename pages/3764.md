## Idea

The Gelfand--Naimark--Segal (GNS) construction establishes a correspondence between cyclic $*$-[[representation]]s of $C^*$-[[C*-algebra|algebras]] and certain linear functionals (usually called _states_) on those same $C^*$-algebras.  The correspondence comes about from an explicit construction of the [[star-representation|*-representation]] from one of the [[linear functionals|linear functionals]] (states).


## GNS construction

###### Theorem

Given a [[states in AQFT and operator algebra|state]], $\rho$, on some [[C*-algebra]], $A$, there is a $*$-[[representation]] $\pi$ of $A$ with a [[cyclic vector]] $\xi$ whose associated state is $\rho$.  In other words,

$$
  \rho(x)= \langle \xi, \pi(x)\xi \rangle
$$

for every $x$ in $A$.

_and this needs to be finished.  I don't have the head for this right now._


## Applications

The GNS construction is a central ingredient that translates between the [[Heisenberg picture]] and the [[Schrödinger picture]] of [[quantum mechanics]]: the [[AQFT]] and the [[FQFT]] picture of [[quantum field theory]]. In the former one considers $C^\ast$-[[algebras of observables]], in the latter the [[spaces of states]]. Given a $C^\ast$-algebra of observables, the corresponding space of state can be taken to be that given by the GNS construction.
