## Idea

Various [[(∞,1)-categories]] can be presented by [[model structures]] on the [[category]] $[\Box^{op},Set]$ of [[cubical sets]], _i.e._, presheaves on a [[category of cubes]] $\Box$.

For example, the theory of [[test categories]] produces model structures on categories of cubical sets whose [[homotopy theory]] is that of the [[classical model structure on simplicial sets]].
Using this version of the [[homotopy hypothesis]]-theorem, cubical sets are a way to describe the [[homotopy type]] of [[∞-groupoid]]s using of all the [[geometric shapes for higher structures]] the [[cube]].

Cubical sets can also be used to build model structures presenting other homotopy theories, such the [[model structures for cubical quasicategories]] presenting [[(∞,1)-categories]].

## Presentations of infinity-groupoids

### Ordered cubical sets

Write $\Box$ for the _ordered cube category_ defined at _[[category of cubes]]_.
There is an evident [[simplicial set]]-valued [[functor]]

$$
  \begin{array}{rcl}
    \Box &\to& sSet \\
    I^n &\mapsto& (\Delta[1])^{\times n}
  \end{array}
$$

from the [[cube category]] to [[sSet]] which sends the cubical $n$-cube to the simplicial $n$-cube.

Similarly, there is a canonical [[Top]]-valued functor

$$
  \begin{array}{rcl}
    \Box &\to& Top \\
    I^n &\mapsto& [0,1]^{n}
  \end{array}
$$

The corresponding [[nerve and realization]] [[adjunction]]

$$
  (|-| \dashv Sing_\Box) : Top \stackrel{\overset{|-|}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{Sing_\Box}{\to}} [\Box^{op},Set]
$$

is the cubical analogue of the simplicial nerve and realization adjunction.

###### Theorem

There is a [[model structure on cubical sets]] $[\Box^{op},Set]$ whose

* weak equivalences are the morphisms that become weak equivalences under geometric realization $|-|$;

* cofibrations are the [[monomorphism]]s.

This is ([Jardine, section 3](#Jardine)).

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Proposition

An explicit set of generating cofibrations is given by the boundary inclusions $\partial \Box^n \to \Box^n$, and a set of generating acyclic cofibrations is given by the horn inclusions $\sqcap_{k,\epsilon}^n \to \Box^n$.

=--

This is ([Cisinski 2006, Thm 8.4.38](#Cisinski)).

As a consequence, the fibrations are exactly cubical Kan fibrations.
The following theorem establishes a form of the [[homotopy hypothesis]] for cubical sets.

+-- {: .num_theorem #Ordered}
###### Theorem

The [[unit of an adjunction|unit of the adjunction]]

$$
  A \to Sing_\Box(|A|)
$$

is a weak equivalence in $[\Box^{op},Set]$ for every cubical set $A$.

The counit of the adjunction

$$
  |Sing_\Box X| \to X
$$

is a weak equivalence in $Top$ for every topological space $X$.

It follows that we have an [[equivalence of categories]] induced on the [[homotopy categories]]

$$
  Ho(Top) \simeq Ho([\Box^{op},Set])
  \,.
$$

=--

This is ([Jardine, theorem 29, corollary 30](#Jardine)).

In fact, by the discussion at _[[adjoint (∞,1)-functor]]_  it follows that the [[derived functors]] of the adjunction exhibit the [[simplicial localizations]] of cubical sets equivalent to that of simplicial sets, hence makes their [[(∞,1)-categories]] [[equivalence of (∞,1)-categories|equivalent]] (hence equivalent to [[∞Grpd]]). 

### Other cubical sets

The model structure from Theorem \ref{OrderedCubeModelStructure} and the equivalence of its homotopy theory to that of [[Top]] can be derived using the theory of [[test categories]] (see ([Cisinski 2006, Section 8.4](#Cisinski))).
Test category theory can be used more generally to derive model structures presenting [[∞Grpd]] on $[\Cube^{op},Set]$ for other cube categories $\Box$.

The weak equivalences are not in general induced from the [[weak homotopy equivalences]] by the geometric realization functor $|-| \colon [\Box^{op},Set] \to Top$ sending $I^n$ to $[0,1]^{n}$, but rather from the weak equivalences of the [[Thomason model structure]] by the realization $[\Box^{op},Set] \to Cat$ sending $I^n$ to the slice category $\Box/I^n$.
It is also not always true that the [[trivial cofibrations]] are generated by cubical horn inclusions $\sqcap_{k,\epsilon}^n \to \Box^n$, as is the case for the minimal cube category; such characterizations rely on [[Reedy category]] structure on the cube category.

A case of particular interest is the ordered cube category with a connection.
Unlike the minimal cube category, this cube category is a [[strict test category]] ([Maltsiniotis 2009](#Maltsiniotis2009)), meaning its weak equivalences are closed under product.
This is one motivation for using cubes with connections as opposed to the minimal cube category; see _[[connection on a cubical set]]_ for more details.

[Buchholtz and Morehouse (2017)](#BuchholtzMorehouse2017) outline a class of cube categories and investigate which are test and/or strict test categories.

## Joyal-type model structures

In complete analogy to [[simplicial sets]], there is also an analogue of the [[Joyal model structure]] on [[cubical sets]], with or without connection.
See the article _[[model structures for cubical quasicategories]]_.

## Cubical-type model structures

In [[cubical type theory]] one uses more structured notions of cubical set (symmetric, cartesian, De Morgan, etc.).
In most cases such categories have both a [[test model structure]], which presents [[∞Grpd]], and a [[cubical-type model structure]] that corresponds to the interpretation of type theory.
In many cases these are *not* equivalent, and the cubical-type model structure does not model classical homotopy types.
See _[[cubical-type model structure]]_ for more discussion.

### Cubical sets without connections

Using that the [[cube category]] is a [[test category]] a model structure on cubical sets follows as a special case of the [[model structure on presheaves over a test category]], due to 

* [[Denis-Charles Cisinski]], _[[joyalscatlab:Les préfaisceaux comme type d'homotopie]]_, Asterisque __308__.
  {#Cisinksi}

Cisinski also derives explicit generating cofibrations and generating acyclic cofibrations using his theory of [[generalized Reedy category]], or _categories skelettiques_. See Section 8.4.

### Cubical sets with max-connections

The following paper proves that [[cubical sets with connections]] (more specifically, max-connections) form a [[strict test category]] and therefore admit a [[cartesian model structure]] that is Quillen equivalent to the [[Kan–Quillen model structure]] on [[simplicial sets]]:

* {#Maltsiniotis2009} [[Georges Maltsiniotis]], _La catégorie cubique avec connexions est une catégorie test stricte_, Homology, Homotopy and Applications 11:2 (2009), 309-326.  [doi](http://dx.doi.org/10.4310/hha.2009.v11.n2.a15).

### Cubical sets with max-connections and min-connections

The case of cubical sets with both max-connections and min-connections largely follows the case of cubical sets with max-connections, the corresponding category of cubes again being a [[strict test category]].
The relevant results are stated explicitly as Corollary 3 and Theorem 3 of
