## Idea

The 0-mode of the [[supercharge]] in a [[2d SCFT]] (an operator in a ([[sheaf of vertex operator algebras|sheaf of]]) [[super vertex operator algebra]]) behaves like a higher dimensional analog of the operator $D$ in a [[spectral triple]], hence the supercharge in [[supersymmetric quantum mechanics]]. Specifically for a [[sigma-model]] 2d SCFT induced from some [[target space]] geometry it is a higher version of a [[Dirac operator]] on that space (roughtly like what one would expect of a [[Dirac operator on a smooth loop space]]). This is called the _Dirac-Ramond operator_ (after [[Pierre Ramond]]).

The [[index]] of the [[large volume limit]] of the Dirac-Ramond operator is what is now known as the [[Witten genus]] (but in fact the original article ([Alvarez-Killingback-Mangano-Windey 87](#AlvarezKillingbackManganoWindey87)
) appeared independently almost in parallel of Witten's discussion).

## References

The Dirac-Ramond operator ofriginates with the early beginning of [[superstring]] models, when they were still called _[[spinning strings]]_. See there for references.

The Dirac-Ramond operator gained more attention in pure mathemaitcs when it was found that the [[large volume limit]]  of its [[index]], when properly construed, is a universal [[elliptic genus]], now known as the [[Witten genus]]. See there for more references.
