## Idea

A [[normal variety]] is called a **[[symplectic variety]]** if its [[smooth variety|smooth part]] admits a holomorphic [[symplectic form]], whose pull-back to any resolution extends to a holomorphic 2-form. If this 2-form is itself symplectic, the given resolution is called a **symplectic resolution**.  More generally, an algebraic variety is said to have **symplectic singularities** if every point in the variety has a neighborhood which carries a symplectic structure.

Symplectic resolutions are analogous to [[hyper KÃ¤hler manifolds]].
