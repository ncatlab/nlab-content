\begin{remark}
**(terminology)**
The term  _[[simplicial groupoid]]_ is often used for a [[simplicial object]] in the [[category]] [[Grpd]] of [[groupoids]] whose [[simplicial set]] of objects is simplicially constant. We will write $s Grpd$ for the category of such simplicial groupoids.

Perhaps a more accurate term for this concept is **simplicially enriched groupoid**, and conceptually it is often the [[sSet-enriched category]]-[[structure]] that is useful. Because of this it is advisable to check the use being made of the term when consulting the literature. This is more fully discussed at *[[simplicial category]]*.
\end{remark}


## Definition

Write $sGrpd_{DK}$ for the [[category]] of [[simplicial groupoids]] (whose [[simplicial sets]] of [[objects]] are understood to be constant, see the discussion [there](simplicial+groupoid#Definition)).

\begin{proposition}\label{TheModelStructure}
There is a [[model category]] structure on $sGrpd_{DK}$ whose

* [[fibrations]] are those morphisms $f \colon H \to K$ such that 

  1. for every [[object]] $x$ of $H$ and every [[morphism]] $\omega \colon f(x) \to y$ in $K_0$ there is a morphism $\hat \omega : x \to z$ of $H_0$ such that $f(\hat \omega) = \omega$;

  1. for every object $x$ in $H$ the induced morphism $f \colon H(x,x) \to K(f(x), f(x))$ is a [[Kan fibration]].

* [[weak equivalences]] are those morphisms $f \colon H \to K$ such that

  1. $f$ induces in [[isomorphism]] on [[connected components]] $\pi_0 f \colon \pi_0 H \to \pi_0 K$;

  1. for each object $x$ of $H$ the induced morphism $H(x,x) \to K(f(x), f(x))$ is a weak equivalence in the [[model structure on simplicial groups]] or equivalently in the [[model structure on simplicial sets]].
\end{proposition}
This is due to [Dwyer & Kan (1984), ยง1.1, ยง1.2, Thm. 2.5](#DwyerKan84), reviewed in [Goerss & Jardine (2009), p. 316 and after cor V.7.3](#GoerssJardine09).

## Properties

\begin{proposition}
\label{QuillenEquivalenceWithSimplicialSets}

The 

* [[Dwyer-Kan loop groupoid]]-construction $\mathcal{G}$ ([[left adjoint]])

* [[simplicial classifying space]]-construction $\overline{W}$ ([[right adjoint]])

constitute a [[Quillen equivalence]]

$$
  sGrpd_{DK}
  \underoverset
    {\underset{\overline{W}}{\longrightarrow}}
    {\overset{\mathcal{G}}{\longleftarrow}}
    {\;\;\;\; \simeq_{_{\mathrlap{Qu}}} \;\;\;\;}
  sSet_{Qu}  
$$

between the model structure on $sGrpd_{DK}$ from Prop. \ref{TheModelStructure} and the [[classical model structure on simplicial sets]].

In addition both $\mathcal{G}$ and $\overline W$ preserve all [[weak equivalences]].

\end{proposition}

This is due to [Dwyer & Kan (1984)](#DwyerKan84), reviewed in [Goerss & Jardine (2009), Theorem 7.8](#GoerssJardine).

###### Remark

When restricted to simplicial groupoids of the form $(B G)_\bullet$ for $G_\bullet$ a [[simplicial group]] and $B G_n$ its [[delooping]] [[groupoid]] this produces a standard presentation of [[looping and delooping]] for [[infinity-groups]]. See there and at *[[model structure on simplicial groups]]* for more.
