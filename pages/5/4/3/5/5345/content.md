Before we start, beware the usual terminology issue with "[[simplicial groupoids]]":

\begin{remark}
**(terminology)**
This entry is concernd with  _[[simplicial groupoids]]_ as traditionally understood (following [Dwyer & Kan (1984)](#DwyerKan84)), referring to [[simplicial objects]] in the [[category]] [[Grpd]] of [[groupoids]] with the special property that their [[simplicial set]] of objects is simplicially constant. Any such "Dwyer-Kan simplicial groupoid" is equivalently an [[sSet-enriched category]] that is a [[groupoid]] in the [[enriched category theory|enriched]] sense. Therefore, and since in applications it is often this [[sSet]]-[[enriched category|enriched]] [[structure]] which matters, a more accurate term would be *simplicially enriched groupoids*, but this terminology is not at all standard. See the corresponding discussion at *[[simplicial groupoid]]* ([here](simplicial+groupoid#Definition)).
\end{remark}


## Definition

Write $sGrpd_{DK}$ for the [[category]] of [[simplicial groupoids]] (whose [[simplicial sets]] of [[objects]] are understood to be constant, see the discussion [there](simplicial+groupoid#Definition)).

\begin{definition}\label{FreeMorphismsOfSimplicialGroupoids}
**(free morphisms of simplicial groupoids)**
\linebreak
  Say that a [[morphism]] $f \colon X \to Y$ of [[simplicial groupoids]] is *free* iff:

1. it is degreewise [[injective]] (i.e. on the [[sets]] of [[objects]] and on the sets of [[morphisms]] in each degree);

1. there is a [[subset]] $\Gamma \subset Y$ of [[morphisms]] in $Y$ (of any degree) with the following properties:

   1. $\Gamma$ contains no [[identity morphisms]];

   1. $\Gamma$ is closed under forming degenerate cells;

   1. every non-[[identity morphism]] in $Y$ is *uniquely* a [[composition|composite]] of morphisms in $\Gamma$ where

      1. no morphism is composed with its inverse

      1. no two non-[[identity morphisms]] in the [[image]] of $f$ are composed with each other.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}\label{TheModelStructure}
**(Dwyer-Kan model structure on simplicial groupoids)**
\linebreak
There is a [[model category]] structure on $sGrpd_{DK}$ whose

* [[fibrations]] are those morphisms $f \colon H \to K$ such that 

  1. for every [[object]] $x$ of $H$ and every [[morphism]] $\omega \colon f(x) \to y$ in $K_0$ there is a morphism $\hat \omega : x \to z$ of $H_0$ such that $f(\hat \omega) = \omega$;

  1. for every object $x$ in $H$ the induced morphism $f \colon H(x,x) \to K(f(x), f(x))$ is a [[Kan fibration]].

* [[weak equivalences]] are those morphisms $f \colon H \to K$ such that

  1. $f$ induces in [[isomorphism]] on [[connected components]] $\pi_0 f \colon \pi_0 H \to \pi_0 K$;

  1. for each object $x$ of $H$ the induced morphism $H(x,x) \to K(f(x), f(x))$ is a weak equivalence in the [[model structure on simplicial groups]] or equivalently in the [[classical model structure on simplicial sets]].

* [[cofibrations]] are the [[retracts]] (in the [[arrow category]]) of the free maps from Def. \ref{FreeMorphismsOfSimplicialGroupoids}.

\end{proposition}

This is due to [Dwyer & Kan (1984), ยง1.1, ยง1.2, Thm. 2.5](#DwyerKan84), reviewed in [Goerss & Jardine (2009), p. 316 and after cor V.7.3](#GoerssJardine09).

\begin{remark}\label{RelationToModelStructureOnSimplicialGroups}
**(relation to model structure on simplicial groups)**
\linebreak
  An $X \in sGrpd_{DK}$ for which $X_0 = \ast$ is the [[terminal groupoid]] is, when regarded as a [[pointed object]], equivalently the ([[delooping]] of the) [[simplicial group]] which is its unique [[hom-object]]. Restricted to such "simplicial [[delooping groupoids]]" of simplicial groups and under this identitificaiton, the fibrations and weak equivalences in Prop. \ref{FreeMorphismsOfSimplicialGroupoids} are those of the [[model structure on simplicial groups]].
\end{remark}

## Properties

### Relation to simplicial sets

\begin{proposition}
\label{QuillenEquivalenceWithSimplicialSets}

The 

* [[Dwyer-Kan loop groupoid]]-construction $\mathcal{G}$ ([[left adjoint]])

* [[simplicial classifying space]]-construction  $\overline{W}$ ([[right adjoint]], see [here](simplicial+classifying+space#BarWForSimplicialGroupoid))

constitute a [[Quillen equivalence]]

$$
  sGrpd_{DK}
  \underoverset
    {\underset{\overline{W}}{\longrightarrow}}
    {\overset{\mathcal{G}}{\longleftarrow}}
    {\;\;\;\; \simeq_{_{\mathrlap{Qu}}} \;\;\;\;}
  sSet_{Qu}  
$$

between the model structure on $sGrpd_{DK}$ from Prop. \ref{TheModelStructure} and the [[classical model structure on simplicial sets]].

In addition both $\mathcal{G}$ and $\overline W$ preserve all [[weak equivalences]].

\end{proposition}

This is due to [Dwyer & Kan (1984)](#DwyerKan84), reviewed in [Goerss & Jardine (2009), Theorem 7.8](#GoerssJardine).

###### Remark

When restricted to simplicial groupoids of the form $(\mathbf{B} G)_\bullet$ for $G_\bullet$ a [[simplicial group]] and $\mathbf{B} G_n$ its [[delooping groupoid]] this produces a standard presentation of [[looping and delooping]] for [[infinity-groups]]. See there and at *[[model structure on simplicial groups]]* for more.

\begin{lemma}\label{AcyclicFibrationsSurjectiveOnObjects}
Any [[acyclic fibration]] $f \in Fib \cap \mathrm{W}$ of simplicial groupoids is [[surjective]] on objects. 
\end{lemma}
One lazy way to see this:
\begin{proof}
For $f_\bullet \in Fib \cap \mathrm{W}$ an acyclic Kan fibration, notice that:

1. Since the [[simplicial classifying space]] functor on simplicial groupoids ([here](simplicial+classifying+space#BarWForSimplicialGroupoid)) is a [[right Quillen functor]] by Prop. \ref{QuillenEquivalenceWithSimplicialSets} it follows that $\overline{W}(f) \in Fib \cap \mathrm{W}$ is an [[acyclic Kan fibration]]

1. All acylic fibrations in the [[classical model structure on simplicial sets]] are degreewise surjective (see [this Prop.](acyclic+Kan+fibration#AcyclicKanFibrationsAreSurjective)). 

But since $\overline{W}$ is the identity on the sets of objects/vertices (by its definition [here](simplicial+classifying+space#BarWForSimplicialGroupoid)), the claim follows.
\end{proof}

Also useful to notice is:

\begin{proposition}
\label{sGrpdCofibrationIsObjectwiseSSetCofibration}
  A (acyclic) cofibration of simplicial groupoids is objectwise an (acyclic) injection, hence a [[classical model structure on simplicial sets|Kan-Quillen]] (acyclic) cofibation, of simplicial [[hom-sets]].
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  By Def. \ref{FreeMorphismsOfSimplicialGroupoids} and Prop. \ref{TheModelStructure} these cofibrations of simplicial groupoids are, in particular, retracts of monomorphisms of simplcial set. Since [[sSet]] is a [[topos]], its [[epi-mono factorization system]] implies that monomorphisms are preserved under retracts. And of course also the Kan-Quillen weak equivalences are preserved under retract.
\end{proof}
