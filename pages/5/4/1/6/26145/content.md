## Selected work

On [[Hall algebras]]:

* [[Claus M. Ringel]], *The Hall multiplication]*, lecture notes  (2006) &lbrack;[web](https://www.math.uni-bielefeld.de/~ringel/lectures/green/Welcome.html)&rbrack; 


Ringel realized that [[Hall algebra|Hall's construction]] of an associative algebra structure from the combinatorics of flags of [[p-group|p-abelian groups]] (defined in terms of numbers of extensions) can be applied to the category of representations of a quiver over a finite field $\mathbf{F}_q$ and related it to quantum groups in

* C. M. Ringel, _Hall algebras and quantum groups_, Invent. Math. __101__ (3): 583--591, [doi](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01231516) [MR1062796](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=1062796)
* wikipedia: [Ringel-Hall algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringel%E2%80%93Hall_algebra)

This work influenced [[George Lusztig]]'s work on quantum groups where Lusztig has constructed "the upper half" of quantum group as a Hall algebra adapted to perverse sheaves over flag variety of a quiver.
