
Various concepts in [[philosophy]] and [[mathematics]] go by the name *monad*.

Historically, going back to [[Gottfried Leibniz]]'s *[Monadology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monadology)* (1714), "monad" is used to refer to a kind of "[[atom]]", for Leibniz a *mind-like simple substance*. 

It certainly seems (but remains implicit) that [Robinson 1966 (p. 57)](nonstandard+analysis#Robinson66) meant to follow Leibniz' terminology when introducing the notion of 

* *[[monad in nonstandard analysis]]*, referring to [[infinitesimal neighbourhoods]] (as such also used in [[synthetic differential geometry]], cf. [Kock 1980](infinitesimal+neighborhood#Kock80)).

Just a few years later, [Bénabou 1967](monad#Bénabou67) introduces the term

* *[[monad]] in [[categorical algebra]]*

(see the *[etymology](monad#Etymology)* there).

Bénabou's reasoning on this choice of terminology has not survived, but it is curious to notice that the above construction of monads in the sense of [[infinitesimal neighbourhoods]] is an example of a monad in the sense of categorical algebra (see [there](infinitesimal+disk+bundle#MonadicityAdjointToJetBundles)).

Another way to square the category-theoretic use of the term "[[monads]]" with Leibnizian "[[atoms]]" is to observe that the former are equivalently [[lax 2-functors]] $\ast \longrightarrow Cat$ from the [[terminal category]] to the [[Cat|2-category of categories]] and hence are [[global element|"points"]] in the some [[2-category theory|2-category theoretic]] sense.

Finally, there is the term

* *[[Beilinson monad]]*

which may be trying to evoke the picture not of an infinitesimal but a "[[homological algebra|homological]]" neighbourhood.
