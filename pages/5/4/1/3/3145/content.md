Hopkins is a world leading researcher in [[algebraic topology]] and ([[stable homotopy theory|stable]]-)[[homotopy theory]].

Among his notable achievements are his work on the [[Ravenel conjectures]], the introduction and discussion of the [[generalized cohomology theory]] _[[tmf]]_  and its [[string orientation of tmf|string orientation]], a formalization and construction of [[differential cohomology]], the proof of the [[Kervaire invariant]] problem.  More recently via [[Jacob Lurie]]'s work on the [[cobordism hypothesis]] Hopkins participates in work related to the foundations of [[quantum field theory]].
