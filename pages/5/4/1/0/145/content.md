#Definition#

By $CartesianSpaces$ we denote the category

* whose objects are the spaces $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n \in \mathbb{N}$, equipped with their standard smooth structure;

* whose morphisms are all smooth maps of manifolds between these spaces.


So $CartesianSpaces$ is the full subcategory of $Manifolds$ on the $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

#Remarks#

* Let $CartesianSpaces_{pr} \hookrightarrow CartesianSpaces$ be the subcategory of $CartesianSpaces$ whose morphisms are restricted to be the standard injections and projections on $CartesianSpaces$. 
If we write $FinSet$ for the skeletal version of the category of finite sets, with objects identified with the natural numbers, then $CartesianSpaces_{pr} \simeq FinSet$.

* $CartesianSpaces$ appear as test objects in the context of [[generalized smooth space]]s and [[generalized smooth algebra]]s.
