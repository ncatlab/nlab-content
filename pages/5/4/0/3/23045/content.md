## Idea

The [[unitary group]] on an infinite-dimensional [[separable Hilbert space|separable]] [[Hilbert space]] $\mathcal{H}$.

* [[Kuiper's theorem]]

## Related concepts

* [[stable unitary group]]

* [[universal equivariant PU(â„‹)-bundle]]

Proof that the weak- and strong- [[operator topology]] as well as the [[compact-open topology]] (...) all agree on $U(\mathcal{H})$ (and the norm topology is still strictly finer):

This paper made the mistake of assuming that because various topologies were distinct on $GL(\mathcal{H})$, they remain distinct on $U(\mathcal{H})$.
