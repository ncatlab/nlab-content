## Overview

__Material set theory__ (also called _membership-based set
theory_) is a style of [[set theory]] with a primitive global membership relation "$\in$" where sets are characterized only by "$\in$" and [[propositional equality]] of sets. (The terminology 'material', or at least 'materialistic', goes back at least to [Friedman 1997](#Friedman1997).) Material set theory contrasts with *[[structural set theory]]* (cf. *[[material versus structural set theory]]*), as well as with set theories which are neither structural nor material. Material set theories are [[simple type theory|simply sorted]] [[set theory]].
