## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

An [[object]] $X$ in an [[abelian category]] is said to be __semisimple__ or __completely reducible__ if it is a [[coproduct]] ([[direct sum]]) of [[simple objects]]. 

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Sometimes this notion is considered in a bit more general setup than [[abelian category|abelian]] (where it is most often used); sometimes with subtle variants. For [[Lie algebras]], it is a bit different by convention: a Lie algebra is a __[[semisimple Lie algebra]]__ if it is a [[direct sum]] of *nonabelian* simple Lie algebras; though a 1-dimensional abelian Lie algebra is simple in the categorical (and in common) sense.

###### Definition

A semisimple object is __isotypic__ if it is a [[direct sum]] of [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] simple objects (the isomorphism class of a simple object is called its _type_).

## Properties

###### Proposition 

An object in an abelian category is semisimple if and only if it is the coproduct of all its simple subobjects.

###### Proposition 

If an object $X$ in an abelian category is semisimple then every [[short exact sequence]] $0 \to A \to X \to B \to 0$ [[split exact sequence|splits]].  

=--

An abelian category in which all short exact sequences split is called a *spectral category*, and not every spectral category is semisimple (see [MathOverflow](https://mathoverflow.net/a/327944/2893)).
