## Idea

A _prime knot_ is a [[knot]] that cannot be [[composite knot|decomposed]], that is to say, a knot that cannot be constructed from the [[knot sum]] of two non-[[unknot|trivial]] knots. 

In the context of [[knot complexity]], whether or not a knot is prime is nontrivial. Any knot which is not _prime_ is called a [[composite knot]].  

## Examples

* The [[unknot]]

* The fundamental example of a _prime knot_ is the [[trefoil]] with three [[crossings]]

* The family of [[torus knots]]


## Related concepts

* [[composite knot]]

* [[prime number]]

* [[prime geodesic]]
