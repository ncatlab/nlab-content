
## Idea

Dodgson condensation is a method of calculating the [[determinant]] of $n\times n$-matrix by means of a determinant of $(n-1)\times(n-1)$-matrix whose entries are $2\times 2$-minors of the original entry and divided by certain correction. This gives an algorithm for computing determinants of order $n$ in cubic time in $n$.

It is related to [[cluster algebras]] and its underlying "Lewis Caroll" identity is, as shown by Gelfand et al., a special case of [[Sylvester identity]].
