## Idea

In [[type theory]], a _type universe_ -- usually written $\mathcal{U}$ or $Type$ -- is a [[type]] whose [[terms]] are either themselves [[type|types]] (Russell universes), or representations of types in an internal model of the type theory (Tarski universes). Either way, it is a [[universe]] of (small) [[type|types]], a _universe in type theory_, and sometimes called a _type of types_.

{#TypeUniverseAsReflection} One also speaks of $\mathcal{U}$ as being a _reflection_ of the type system in itself (e.g. [MartinL&#246;f 74, p. 6](#MartinLoef74), [Palmgren, pp. 2-3](#Palmgren), [Rathjen, p. 1](#Rathjen), [Luo 11, section 2.5](#Luo11), [Luo 12, p. 2](#Luo12), [Stanf. Enc. Phil.](#SEP)), following the _[[reflection principle]]_ in [[set theory]].

In [[homotopy type theory]] a type of (small) types is what in [[(∞,1)-category theory|higher]] [[categorical semantics]] is interpreted as a (small) _[[object classifier]]_.  Thus, the type of types is a refinement of the [[type of propositions]] which only contains the [[(-1)-truncated]]/[[h-level]]-1 types (and is semantically a [[subobject classifier]]).

In the presence of a type universe a [[judgement]] of the form

$$
  \vdash A : \mathcal{U}
$$

says that $A$ is a [[term]] of [[type]] $\mathcal{U}$, hence is either a (small) [[type]] itself (for Russell universes), or a representation of types in an internal model of the type theory (for Tarski universes). 

More generally, in Russell universes a [[hypothetical judgement]] of the form

$$
  x : X \vdash A(x) : \mathcal{U}
$$

says that $A$ is an $X$-[[dependent type]].

In Tarski universes the corresponding hypothetical judgment would be of the form

$$
  x : X \vdash El(A)(x)\; type
$$

In [[homotopy type theory]] the type universe $\mathcal{U}$ is often assumed to satisfy the [[univalence]] [[axiom]]. This is a reflection of the fact that in its [[categorical semantics]] as an [[object classifier]] is part of an [[internal (∞,1)-category]] in the ambient [[(∞,1)-topos]]: the one that as an [[indexed category]] is the small [[codomain fibration]].

[[Per Martin-Lof]]'s original type theory contained a Russell universe which contained *all* types, which therefore in particular contained itself, i.e. one had $Type : Type$. But it was pointed out by [[Jean-Yves Girard]] that this was inconsistent; see [[Girard's paradox]]. Thus, modern type theories generally contain a hierarchy of types universes, with 

$$n:\mathbb{N} \vdash \mathcal{U}(n) : \mathcal{U}(n + 1)$$

for Russell universes, and 

$$n:\mathbb{N} \vdash \mathcal{U}(n)\; type$$
$$n:\mathbb{N} \vdash \mathcal{U}^{'}(n) : \mathcal{U}(n + 1)$$
$$n:\mathbb{N} \vdash El_{n+1}(\mathcal{U}^{'}(n)) \equiv Type(n)$$
$$n:\mathbb{N} \vdash El_{n,n+1}:\mathcal{U}(n) \to \mathcal{U}(n + 1)$$
$$n:\mathbb{N} \vdash p:is1Monic(El_{n,n+1})$$

for Tarski universes. 

## Formalizations 

### Russell universe
  {#RussellStyle}

A **[[Russell universe]]** or **universe &#224; la Russell** is a [[type]] whose terms *are* types. In the presence of a separate [[judgment]] "$A \;type$", this can be formulated as a [[natural deduction|deduction rule]] of the form

$$\frac{A:\mathcal{U}}{A \;type}$$

Thus, the [type formers](natural+deduction#IntroductionAndElimination) have rules saying which universe they belong to, such as:

$$\frac{A:\mathcal{U}\quad B:A\to \mathcal{U}}{\Pi\, A\, B : \mathcal{U}}$$

With Russell universes, we can also omit the judgment "$A\; type$" and replace it everywhere by a judgment that A is a term of some universe. This is the approach taken by the [[Homotopy Type Theory -- Univalent Foundations of Mathematics|HoTT textbook]] and by [[Coq]].

### Tarski universes
 {#TarskiStyle}

A **[[Tarski universe]]** or a **universe &#224; la Tarski** ([Hofmann, section 2.1.6](#Hofmann), [Luo 12](#Luo12), [Gallozzi 14, p. 40](#Gallozzi14)) is a type $U$ together with an "interpretation" operation allowing us to regard its [[terms]] as _codes_ or _names_ for actual types. Thus we have a rule such as

$$\frac{A:\mathcal{U}}{El(A)\;type}$$

saying that for each term $A$ of the type universe $U$ there is an actual type $El(A)$. This is the approach taken by [[Egbert Rijke]]'s [[Introduction to Homotopy Type Theory]]. 

Conversely, with notation as used at _[[object classifier in an (infinity,1)-topos]]_, one might write $A = 'El(A)'$ to indicate that $A$ is the _name_ of the type $El(A)$ in the type universe.

We usually also have operations on the universe corresponding to (but not identical to) type formers, such as

$$\frac{A:\mathcal{U}\quad B:A\to \mathcal{U}}{\pi(A, B) : \mathcal{U}}$$

with an [[equality]] $El(\pi(A,B))=\Pi \, El(A)\, El(B)$. Usually this latter equality (and those for other type formers) is a [[judgmental equality]]. If it is only an [[equivalence in homotopy type theory|equivalence]] (i.e. we have a rule which gives us a canonical term of the equivalence type), we may speak of a **[[weakly Tarski universe]]** ([Gallozzi 14, p. 49-50](#Gallozzi14)).

We can give a slightly different definition of weakly Tarski universe using [[propositional equality]] and a larger universe. More precisely, we can consider two (or many) universes $\mathcal{U}$ and $\mathcal{U}'$ with the usual rules for the relative reflection $el(a):\mathcal{U}'$ for any $a:U$, a choice of weakly or strongly Tarski [[computation rules]] for the reflections $El$ and $El'$, and a computation rule for the relative reflection el of $\mathcal{U}$ inside $\mathcal{U}'$ based on propositional equality, which gives us canonical elements of the identity types $Id_{\mathcal{U}'}(\pi'(el(a),el(b)),el(\pi(a,b)))$ and similarly for the other type formers.

If the containing universe is univalent the two definitions turn out to coincide.

The three notions of Tarski universe can be ordered by generality: Every Tarski universe is weakly Tarski by equivalences, because both definitional equality of types $A \equiv B$ and the identity types between two types $A = B$ imply that the two types of equivalent $A \simeq_\mathcal{U} B$. Similarly, every strict Tarski universe is weakly Tarski by the identity type, because definitional equality of types $A \equiv B$ implies that two types are identified $A = B$. 

Since each type former is independent of each other, one could also have mixed versions of Tarski universes, where some of the type formers are strictly Tarski and some are weakly Tarski. This leads to $2^n$ possible Tarski universes, where $n$ is the number of type formers in a type theory, and the $2^n$ type theories are only [[partially ordered]] by generality. Internally in an ambient universe, that number becomes $3^n$. 

Universes defined internally via [[induction-recursion]] are stricty Tarski. Weakly Tarski universes are easier to obtain in [[semantics]] (see [below](#CategoricalSemantics)): they are somewhat more annoying to use, but probably suffice for most purposes. In [[objective type theory]], there is no [[definitional equality]], so every Tarski universe is weakly Tarski. 

## Properties

### Universe enlargement
 {#UniverseEnlargement}

Both [[Coq]] and [[Agda]] support [[universe polymorphism]] to deal with the issue of universe enlargement. Moreover, Coq supports [[typical ambiguity]].

### Cumulativity

A tower of universes is **cumulative** if $A:\mathcal{U}_i$ implies $A:\mathcal{U}_{i+1}$ (rather than, say, $Lift(A):\mathcal{U}_{i+1}$).

Cumulative Russell universes have some issues; see for instance [Luo 12](#Luo12).

* [[Coq]] uses Russell style universes. For practical purposes, it also has cumulativity, although there is some question (perhaps mainly semantic) of whether this is true internally or whether it uses casts that are simply hidden from the user.

* [[Agda]] uses non-cumulative Russell style universes.

* The [[HoTT Book]] (first edition) uses cumulative Russell style universes.

### Categorical semantics
 {#CategoricalSemantics}

[[univalence|Univalent]]  [Russell universes](#RussellStyle) have been shown to be interpreted in [[type-theoretic model categories]] presenting the base [[(∞,1)-topos]] [[∞Grpd]]
([Kapulkin-Lumsdaine-Voevodsky 12](#KapulkinLumsdaineVoevodsky12))
and more generally presenting [[(∞,1)-toposes]] of [[(∞,1)-presheaves]] over [[elegant Reedy categories]] ([Shulman 13](#Shulman13)).

Discussion for general [[(∞,1)-toposes]] (of [[(∞,1)-sheaves]]) that should have implementation [weakly Tarski](#TarskiStyle) ([Gallozzi 14, p. 49-50](#Gallozzi14)) is in ([Gepner-Kock 12](#GepnerKock12)).
