## Idea

A **$\beta$-ring** is a [[commutative ring]], $R$, equipped with a set of operations, $\beta_H: R \to R$, indexed by subgroups of [[symmetric groups]], $S_n$, satisfying a number of conditions. They may be seen as collections of integral linear combinations of generalized symmetric powers defined on [[Burnside rings]]. The [[cohomotopy]] of a space, $\pi^0(X)$, is a $\beta$-ring ([Guillot 06, Thrm 4.5](#Guillot06)).

They are completely unrelated to [[relational beta-modules]].

## Related concepts
