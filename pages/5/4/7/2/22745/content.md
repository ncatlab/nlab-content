## Definition

An __ordered ring__ is a [[ring]] $R$ with a [[partial order]] such that for all elements $a,b,c$ in $R$, $a \leq b$ implies $a + c \leq b + c$, and $0 \leq a$ and $0 \leq b$ implies $0 \leq a \cdot b$. 

Due to the [[reflexivity]] of the partial order, ordered rings may have [[zero divisors]]. Also, the [[trivial ring]] is an ordered ring.
