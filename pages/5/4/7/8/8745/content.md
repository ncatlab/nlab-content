## Idea

A form of [[PBW theorem]] says that the [[symmetric algebra]] and the [[universal enveloping algebra]] of a [[Lie algebra]] $g$ are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] as [[vector spaces]] (in fact as [[Lie algebra module|$\mathfrak{g}$-modules]], cf. eg. [Dixmier 1974, §2.4.10](#Dixmier74)). 

However this is not an isomorphism [[associative algebras]], but rather an isomorphism of [[filtered object|filtered]] [[coalgebras]]. One can compose the PBW isomorphism with an additional automorphism to get an isomorphism of vector spaces which restricts to isomorphism of __algebras__ when restricted to the subalgebras of $g$-invariant functions. 

The original proof in [Duflo 1977](#Duflo77) is rather case-by-case, using the structure theory of [[Lie algebras]]. Kontsevich in 1998 gave a new proof which generalizes to some geometric situations in deformation quantization and which refines to a fact at the [[derived geometry|derived]] level (expressed in terms of an isomorphism at the level of [[Hochschild cohomology]]). At the level of derived geometry this expresses the property of certain derived exponential map constructed using [[Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg map]] precomposed by a square root of the Todd class in appropriate setup. This has prompted a series of articles by Markarian, Caldararu, Chen and others to explain the appearance of Todd class (or related [[Atiyah class]]). Refinements and analogues include [[Kashiwara-Vergne conjecture]].
