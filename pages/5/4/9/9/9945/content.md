## Idea

A real form of [[Morava E-theory]].

## Properties

### Orientation

The [[orientation in generalized cohomology|orientation]] in $EO(2)$-cohomology of a manifold with [[spin structure]] ($w_1 = 0$ and $w_2 = 0$) is essentially obstructed by the 4th [[Stiefel-Whitney class]] $w_4$ ([Kriz-Sati 04, section 5.2](SatiKriz04)).
