__Riemann-Birkhoff factorization/decomposition__ is a realization of a holomorphic matrix function of a circle as a product of a matrix holomorphic on a neighborhood of closed disk and a function of a matrix holomorphic on a neighborhood of an exterior of the disk including infinity and the circle itself. This decomposition is in the essence of
Riemann-Hilbert problem. The interpretation in terms of loop groups is related to Bruhat decomposition. 

There is an algebraic Birkhoff decomposition discovered in the study of
Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebraic approach to renormalization in QFT.
