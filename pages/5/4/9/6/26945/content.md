## Idea

A polynomial identity in a ring $R$ is a noncommutative polynomial in finitely many variables $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ which evaluates to zero for any choice $a_1\ldots,a_n$ substituted in place of the variables. If $R$ is an algebra in characteristic $p$ then $p x$ is the identity in $R$. It is a very special property of a ring to admit a nontrivial polynomial identity.

## Definition 

A polynomial identity ring is a ring with at least one polynomial identity with at least one of the coefficients
$\pm 1$. 

## Examples

* The commutativity identity $x_1 x_2 - x_2 x_1$ holds in any commutative ring. 

* Amitsur--Levitzki standard identity holds in the ring of $n\times n$-matrices over any field $F$:

$$
\sum_{\pi\in\Sigma(2 n)} 
sign(\pi) x_{\pi(1)}\cdots x_{\pi(2n)}
$$
where $\Sigma(2n)$ is the symmetric group on $2n$ letters.
