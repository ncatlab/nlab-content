There are at least two things that are called _quantum anomalies_ in the context of [[quantum field theory]]

* **anomlous action functional**: the [[action functional]] (in [[path integral|path integral quantization]]) is not a globally well defined function, but a [[section]] of a [[line bundle]] on [[configuration space]];

* **anomalous symmetry**: a symmetry of the [[action functional]] does not extend to a symmetry of the exponentiated action times the path integral measure; or equivalently the action of a group on classical phase space is not preserved by [[deformation quantization]].
