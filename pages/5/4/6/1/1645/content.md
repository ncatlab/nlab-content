There are at least two things that are called _quantum anomalies_ in the context of [[quantum field theory]]

* **anomalous action functional**: the [[action functional]] (in [[path integral|path integral quantization]]) is not a globally well defined [[function]], but instead a [[section]] of a [[line bundle]] on [[configuration space]];

* **anomalous symmetry**: a symmetry of the [[action functional]] does not extend to a symmetry of the exponentiated action times the path integral measure; or equivalently the [[action]] of a group on classical [[phase space]] is not preserved by [[deformation quantization]].

#Examples#

## spinning particles and super-branes ##

The [[sigma-model]] for a [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] fundamental brane on a target space $X$ has an anomaly coming from the nontriviality of Pfaffian line bundles associated with the fermioninc fields on the worldvolume. These anomalies disappear (i.e. these bundles are trivializable) when the structure group of the [[tangent bundle]] of $X$ has a sufficiently high lift through the [[Whitehead tower]] of $O(n)$.

* **Spin structure** the worldline anomaly for the spinning particle/superparticle vanishes when $X$ has [[Spin structure]] 

  This is a classical result. A concrete derivation is in 

  Witten, _Anomalies etc._ (somewhere)

* **String structure** the worldsheet anomaly for the spinning string/superstring in [[heterotic string theory]] vanishes (essentially) when $X$ has [[String structure]] 

  This is originally due to Killingback and Witten. A commented list of literature is [here](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/string/archives/000572.html). Recently [[Ulrich Bunke]] gave the rigorous proof

  * [[Ulrich Bunke]], _String structures and trivialisations of a Pfaffian line bundle_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.0846))

* **Fivebrane structure** the worldvolume anomaly for the super-5-brane in [[dual heterotic string theory]] vanishes (essentially) when $X$ has [[Fivebrane structure]]. See there.
