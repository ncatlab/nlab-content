## Idea

In [[string theory]] by a "probe branes" authors refer to the idea of "adding" to a configuration of [[black branes]] one (or a small number) of further branes whose ([[gravity|gravitational]], [[electromagnetism|electric]], and/or [[RR-field]]) [[backreaction]] on the given [[black brane]] [[background field|background]] is neglected. (So a probe brane "probes" the background geometry with affecting it.)

This is, of course, the case for [[Green-Schwarz sigma-model]]-branes in the given background, but authors tend to speak of "probe branes" when they think of these as actually being [[black branes]] themselves, just so light (i.e. of such small [[number]] compared to the number of background branes) that their backreaction may be neglected not in principle but for practical purposes.

One particular use of (the idea of) probe branes is as [[flavor branes]] in backgrounds appearing in the [[AdS/QCD correspondence]].
