## Idea

Vojta introduced a dictionary between [[value distribution theory]]
of Nevanlinna and [[Diophantine approximation theory]] of Rothand and suggested that this dictionary should continue to hold in the higher dimension.
This leads to qualitative conjectures in 
[[arithmetic geometry]] which cover almost every important conjecture in the field; notably the [[abc conjecture]],
[[Mordell's conjecture]], some of [[Lang's conjecture]]s, etc. The perspective given by [[Arakelov geometry|Arakelov theory]] is central in Vojta's conjectures.
