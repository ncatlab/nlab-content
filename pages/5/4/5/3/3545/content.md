## Definition

A [[dg-algebra]] $A$ is a **formal dg-algebra** if it is [[quasiisomorphism|quasi-isomorphic]] (i.e.: [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] in the [[homotopy category]] of the [[model structure on dg-algebras]])

$$
  A 
  \xrightarrow{\;\;\; \simeq \;\;\;}
  H^\bullet(A)
$$

to its [[chain homology and cohomology|chain (co)homology]] regarded as a dg-algebra with trivial differential. 

Since all dg-algebras are fibrant in the standard model, this is equivalent to the existence of a [[span]]

$$
  A \overset{\;\; \simeq_w \;\;}{\leftarrow} 
  Q A 
  \overset{\;\; \simeq \;\;}{\rightarrow}
  H^\bullet(A)
$$

of [[quasi-isomorphisms]] of dg-algebras.


## Examples

In [[rational homotopy theory]] [[rational topological spaces]] are encoded in their [[Sullivan algebra|Sullivan dg-algebras]] (cf. The [[fundamental theorem of dg-algebraic rational homotopy theory]]). A [[simply connected topological space]] $X$ whose Sullivan dg-algebra $\Omega^\bullet(X)$ is formal is called a **formal topological space**.  (One can also say a __formal rational space__, to distinguish from the unrelated formal spaces in [[formal topology]].)  Such a space represents a **formal homotopy type**.

Examples are

* compact [[KÃ¤hler manifolds]] (e.g. smooth projective varieties),

* [[Lie groups]],

* [[classifying spaces]]$\;B G$ of [[Lie groups]] $G$,

* some [[homogeneous spaces]] $G/H$,

* the unstable [[Thom spaces]] $M U_n$ and $M S O_n$,

* the [[Eilenberg-MacLane space]] $K(\mathbb{Z},n)$, 

  whose Sullivan minimal model is the dg-algebra on a single degree$=n$ generator with trivial differential.,

* [[the little n-disk operad is formal]].
