## Definition

A [[dg-algebra]] $A$ is a **formal dg-algebra** if there exists a [[morphism]]

$$
  A \to H^\bullet(A)
$$

to its [[chain homology and cohomology|chain (co)homology]] (regarded as a dg-algebra with trivial differential) that is a [[quasi-isomorphism]].

## Applications


### In rational homotopy theory

In [[rational homotopy theory]] [[rational topological space]]s are encoded in their dg-algebras of Sullivan forms. The following types of spaces have dg-algebra models that are formal dg-algebras. The corresponding [[rational space]]s are also called **formal homotopy types**.

* [[Kähler manifold]]s;

* [[Lie group]]s;

* [[classifying space]]s of Lie groups;

* some [[homogeneous space]]s $G/H$

* the unstable [[Thom space]]s $M U_n$ and $M S O_n$
