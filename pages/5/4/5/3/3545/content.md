## Definition

A [[dg-algebra]] $A$ is a **formal dg-algebra** if in the [[homotopy category]] of the [[model structure on dg-algebras]] it is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] 

$$
  A \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} H^\bullet(A)
$$

to its [[chain homology and cohomology|chain (co)homology]] (regarded as a dg-algebra with trivial differential). Since all dg-algebras are fibrant in the standard model, this is equivalent to the existence of a [[span]]

$$
  A \stackrel{\simeq_w}{\leftarrow} Q A \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  H^\bullet(A)
$$

of [[quasi-isomorphism]]s of dg-algebras.

## Applications


### In rational homotopy theory

In [[rational homotopy theory]] [[rational topological space]]s are encoded in their dg-algebras of Sullivan forms. A simply connected topological space $X$ whose dg-algebra of Sullivan forms $\Omega^\bullet(X)$ is formal is called a **formal topological space**. It represents a **formal homotopy type**.

Examples are

* [[KÃ¤hler manifold]]s;

* [[Lie group]]s;

* [[classifying space]]s of Lie groups;

* some [[homogeneous space]]s $G/H$

* the unstable [[Thom space]]s $M U_n$ and $M S O_n$
