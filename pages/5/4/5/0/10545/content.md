## Definition

### For ordinary mod $p$ cohomology

The [[associative algebra]] generated by the [[Steenrod square]] operations is called the _Steenrod algebra_ $A$, an [[associative algebra]] over the [[field]] $\mathbb{F}_2$. By [[Brown representability theorem]], this is the algebra 

$$
  H\mathbb{F}_p^\ast(H \mathbb{F}_p)
  \simeq
  [H \mathbb{F}_p,H \mathbb{F}_p]
  \,.
$$

Dually there is the _dual Steenrod algebra_


$$
  H\mathbb{F}_\ast(H \mathbb{F}_p)
  \simeq
  H \mathbb{F}_p \wedge H \mathbb{F}_p
  \,.
$$


### General

Steenrod algebra and its standard properties, such as the Adem relations
follow abstractly for the co-[[Tor]] groups of [[comodules]] over any [[Hopf algebroid]].

This is due to ([May 70, 11.8](#May70)). A review is in ([Ravenel, appendix 1, theorem A1.5.2](#Ravenel)).

## Properties

### Serre-Cartan basis

+-- {: .num_defn #SerreCartanBasis}
###### Definition

The _Serre-Cartan basis_ is the [[subset]] of elements of the Steenrod algebra on those of the form

$$
  Sq^{i_1} \circ Sq^{i_2} \circ \cdots \circ Sq^{i_n}
$$

where $i_k \in \mathbb{N}$ subject to the relation 

$$
  i_k \geq 2 i_{k+1}.
$$

=--

This is indeed a [[linear basis]] for the $\mathbb{F}_2$-[[vector space]] underlying the Steenrod algebra.

### Adem relations

+-- {: .num_prop #AdemRelations}
###### Proposition

The Steenrod square operations satisfy the following relation, for all 
for all $0 \lt i \lt 2 j$:

$$
  Sq^i \circ Sq^j 
   = 
  \sum_{k = 0}^{[i/2]}
  \left(
    \array{
      j - k - 1
      \\
      i - 2k 
    }
  \right)_{mod 2}
  Sq^{i + j -k} \circ Sq^k
$$

=--

These are called the **&#193;dem relations** ([&#193;dem 52](#Adem52)).

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition


The &#193;dam relations precisely generate the [[ideal]] of relations among the Serre-Cartan basis elements, def. \ref{AdemRelations}, in the Steenrod algebra.

### Hopf algebra structure

The Steenrod algebra for mod $p$ coefficients is a [[Hopf algebra]] over $\mathbb{F}_p$ which is graded commutative and non-co-commutative.

This is due to ([Milnor 58](#Milnor58)). A review is in [Ravenel, ch. 3, section 1](#Ravenel).

### Relation to Adams spectral sequence

By construction, the total [[cohomology]] $H^\bullet(X,\mathbb{Z}_2)$ of a [[topological space]] $X$, naturally is a [[module]] over the Steenrod algebra: 

an cohomology element is represented by a [[cocycle]] which is a map $X \longrightarrow B^n \mathbb{Z}_2$ and the action of a [[Steenrod square]] on this is just by [[composition]].

In this form the Steenrod algebra appears in the second page of the
[[Adams spectral sequence]] which computes $[\Sigma^\infty X, \Sigma^\infty Y]$ for [[topological spaces]] $X$ and $Y$: that second page is given by the [[Ext]]-groups

$$
  E_2 = Ext_A(H^\bullet(X, \mathbb{Z}_2), H^\bullet(Y,\mathbb{Z}_2))
$$

computed in the [[category of modules|category of A-modules]] for $A$ the Steenrod algebra.
