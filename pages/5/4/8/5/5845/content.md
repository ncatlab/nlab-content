An __adjoint triple__ of functors $F\dashv G\dashv H$, is a triple of functors $(F,G,H)$ together with adjunction data $F\dashv G$ and $G\dashv H$. the two adjunctions imply of course that $G$ preserves all small limits and colimits. Then also the monad $GF$ has a right adjoint and the comonad $GH$ has a left adjoint. In general there is a duality (an antiequivalence of categories) between the category of monads having right adjoint and comonads having left adjoints.  

For an adjoint triple $F\dashv G\dashv H$ it is known that $F$ is fully faithful iff
$H$ is fully faithful. 

Example. Given any ring homomorphism $f^\circ: R\to S$ (in commutative case dual to s an affine morphism $f: Spec S\to Spec R$ of affine schemes), there is an adjoint triple $f^*\dashv f_*\dashv f^*$ where $f^*: {}_R Mod\to {}_S Mod$ is an extension of scalars, $f_*: {}_S Mod\to {}_R Mod$ the restriction of scalars and $f^! : M\mapsto Hom_R ({}_R S, {}_R M)$ its right adjoint.
