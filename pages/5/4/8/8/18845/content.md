# Admissible rule

## Idea

An admissible rule in a [[logic]] or [[type theory]] is a rule for which there is some algorithm for constructing a proof of the conclusion given proofs of the premises. Compare [[derivable rule]] which is the subset of admissible rules that are given by a "parametric" proof.

In general, making rules admissible only affects the [[strictness]] of models of the logic/theory, a model of a system with specified admissible rules should have a semantic interpretation of the admissible rules and the semantics should preserve this.

## Examples

* the [[cut rule]] and the identity in [[sequent calculus]]
* [[substitution]] in [[natural deduction]]
* [[negation]] in [[classical logic|classical]] [[linear logic]]
