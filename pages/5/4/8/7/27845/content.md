## Idea

In [[electromagnetism]], the standard [[geometry of physics -- flux quantization|flux quantization]] condition ("[[Dirac charge quantization]]") implies that the [[magnetic flux]] $\Phi_\Sigma$ through a [[closed manifold|closed]] [[surface]] $\Sigma$ (which may be the [[one-point compactification]] of an [[open manifold|open]] surface if flux is constrained to [[vanishing at infinity|vanish at infinity]]) is an [[integer]] multiple $N \in \mathbb{N}$ of an indecomposable *quantum* of magnetic flux $\Phi_0$:

$$
  \Phi_\Sigma 
    \;=\; 
  N \cdot \Phi_0
  \,.
$$

Individual magnetic flux quanta are directly observable in [[experiment]]:

* in the guise of [[Abrikosov vortices]] for magnetic flux through effectively 2-dimensional type II [[superconductors]]
  > (since the elementary charge carries in this case are [[Cooper pairs]] of [[electrons]] what is called the flux quantum for [[superconductors]] is in fact $\tfrac{1}{2}\Phi_0$)

* in the guise of [[soliton|solitonic]] [[anyon]] [[quasi-particles]] for magnetic flux through effectively 2-dimensional [[fractional quantum Hall systems]] 

and, hypothetically (conditioned on the existence of [[magnetic monopoles]]):

* in the guise of flux through any [[2-sphere]] surrounding a  [[magnetic monopole]].



## Definition

The *quantum of [[magnetic flux]]* is 

$$
  \phi_0 
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \frac{h}{e}
  \,,
$$

where:

* $h$ is [[Planck's constant]]

* $e$ is the [[charge]] of the [[electron]].

In [SI units](physical+unit#SIUnits) this is approximately

$$
  \begin{aligned}
  \phi_0 
  &\equiv\;
  \frac{h}{e}
  \\
  &\sim\;
  \frac
    {6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, J s}
    {1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, C}
  \\
  &\sim\;
  4.136 \times 10^{-15} \, \frac{J s}{C}
  \\
  &=\;
  4.136 \times 10^{-15} \, T m^2
  \,,
  \end{aligned}
$$

where in the last step we used that 

one *Joule* is one *Newton meter*

$$
  J 
    \;=\;
  N m
$$

and one *Tesla* is one *Newton second per Coulomb meter*

$$
  T 
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \frac
    { N s }
    { C m  }
  \,.
$$
