I am currently undertaking a PhD in the Centre of Australian Category Theory at [Macquarie University](https://www.mq.edu.au/) under the supervision of [[Michael Johnson]] and [[Dominic Verity]]. 

My current research focuses on [[delta lens|delta lenses]], [[cofunctor|cofunctors]], and [[Grothendieck fibration|opfibrations]].
