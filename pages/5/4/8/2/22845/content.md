I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Inria Saclay](https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-saclay-centre) in Palaiseau, France, where I am working with Gabriel Scherer and [[Noam Zeilberger]] in the PARTOUT team.

Before that, I was a PhD student at the Centre of Australian Category Theory (CoACT) and Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia, under the supervision of [[Michael Johnson]] and [[Dominic Verity]]. 

I am broadly interested in category theory and its applications, and so far my research has focused on [[delta lens|delta lenses]], [[Grothendieck fibration|opfibrations]], [[cofunctor|cofunctors]], and [[double categories]].
