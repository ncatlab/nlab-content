## Idea

*Kleisli triple* is the term chosen in [Moggi (1991), Def. 1.2](#Moggi91) for what was previously called an *algebraic theory in extension form* in [Manes (1976), Ex. 3.12 (p. 32)](#Manes76) and what later authors refer to as *[[extension systems]]*. 

All of these terms refer to the equivalent [[axiom|axiomatization]] of [[monads]] (old terminology: "triples") via the ingredients of their [[Kleisli categories]] under the [Kleisli equivalence](Kleisli+category#KleisliEquivalence). 

This is the natural and common incarnation of [[monads in computer science]]; see there for more.
