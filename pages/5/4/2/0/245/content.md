## Idea

Intuitively speaking, a braided monoidal category is a category with a tensor product and an isomorphism called the 'braiding' which lets us 'switch' two objects in a tensor product like $x \otimes y$.

## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn #BraidedMonoidalCategory} 
###### Definition

A **braided monoidal category**, or ("braided [[tensor category]]", but see there), is a [[monoidal category]] $\mathcal{C}$ equipped with a [[natural isomorphism]]

$$ 
  B_{x,y} : x \otimes y \to y \otimes x 
$$

called the **[[braiding]]**, such that the following two kinds of [[commuting diagram|diagrams commute]] for all [[objects]] involved (called the **hexagon identities** encoding the compatibility of the braiding with the [[associator]] for the tensor product):

$$
  \array{
   (x \otimes y) \otimes z 
   &\stackrel{a_{x,y,z}}{\to}&
   x \otimes (y \otimes z)
   &\stackrel{B_{x,y \otimes z}}{\to}&
   (y \otimes z) \otimes x
   \\
   \downarrow^{B_{x,y}\otimes Id}
   &&&&
   \downarrow^{a_{y,z,x}}
   \\
   (y \otimes x) \otimes z
   &\stackrel{a_{y,x,z}}{\to}&
   y \otimes (x \otimes z)
   &\stackrel{Id \otimes B_{x,z}}{\to}&
   y \otimes (z \otimes x)
  }
$$

and

$$
  \array{
   x \otimes (y \otimes z) 
   &\stackrel{a^{-1}_{x,y,z}}{\to}&
   (x \otimes y) \otimes z
   &\stackrel{B_{x \otimes y, z}}{\to}&
   z \otimes (x \otimes y)
   \\
   \downarrow^{Id \otimes B_{y,z}}
   &&&&
   \downarrow^{a^{-1}_{z,x,y}}
   \\
   x \otimes (z \otimes y)
   &\stackrel{a^{-1}_{x,z,y}}{\to}&
   (x \otimes z) \otimes y
   &\stackrel{B_{x,z} \otimes Id}{\to}&
   (z \otimes x) \otimes y
  }
  \,,
$$

where $a_{x,y,z} \colon (x \otimes y) \otimes z \to x \otimes (y \otimes z)$ denotes the components of the [[associator]] of $\mathcal{C}^\otimes$.

###### Definition


If the braiding in def. \ref{BraidedMonoidalCategory} "squares" to the identity in that $B_{y,x} \circ B_{x,y} = id_{x \otimes y}$, then the braided monoidal category is called a _[[symmetric monoidal category]]_.

+-- {: .num_remark} 
###### Remark

Intuitively speaking, the first hexagon identity in def. \ref{BraidedMonoidalCategory} says we may braid $x$ past $y \otimes z$ 'all at once' or in two steps. The second hexagon identity says that we may braid $x \otimes y$ past $z$ all at once or in two steps.  

=--

+-- {: .num_remark} 
###### Remark

From these axioms in def. \ref{BraidedMonoidalCategory}, it follows that the braiding is compatible with the left and right [[unitors]] $l_x : I \otimes x \to x$ and $r_x : x \otimes I \to x$.   That is to say, for all objects $x$ the diagram

$$
  \array{
    I \otimes x &&\stackrel{B_{I,x}}{\to}&& x \otimes I
    \\
    & {}_{l_x}\searrow && \swarrow_{r_x}  
    \\
    && x
  }
$$

commutes.

### In terms of higher monoidal structure

In terms of the language of [[k-tuply monoidal n-categories]] a braided monoidal category is a _doubly monoidal 1-category_ .

Accordingly, by [[delooping]] twice, it may be identified with a [[tricategory]] with a single [[object]] and a single 1-[[morphism]]. 

However, unlike the definition of a monoidal category as a [[bicategory]] with one object, this identification is not trivial; a doubly-degenerate tricategory is literally a category with two monoidal structures that [[interchange law|interchange]] up to isomorphism.  It requires the [[Eckmann-Hilton argument]] to deduce an equivalence with braided monoidal categories.


A commutative [[monoid]] is the same as a monoid [[internalization|in the category of]] monoids.
Similarly, a braided monoidal category is equivalent to a monoidal-category object (that is, a [[pseudomonoid]]) in the monoidal 2-category of monoidal categories.  This result goes back to the [1986 paper by Joyal and Street](http://maths.mq.edu.au/~street/JS1.pdf).

A braided monoidal category is equivalently a category that is equipped with the structure of an [[algebra over an operad|algebra over]] the [[little cubes operad|little 2-cubes operad]].

Details are in example 1.2.4 of

### The 2-category of braided monoidal categories

There is a [[strict 2-category]] BrMonCat with:

* braided monoidal categories as objects,
* [[braided monoidal functor|braided monoidal functors]] as morphisms, 
* [[braided monoidal natural transformation|braided monoidal natural transformations]] as 2-morphisms.
