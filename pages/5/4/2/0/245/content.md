A _braided monoidal category_ is a [[monoidal category]] equipped with a natural isomorphism
$$ B_{x,y} : x \otimes y \to y \otimes x $$
called the _braiding_, which must satisfy an axiom called the [[hexagon identity]].  Intuitively speaking, the braiding lets us 'switch' objects in a tensor product.  

There is a [[strict 2-category]] BrMonCat with:

* braided monoidal categories as objects,
* [[braided monoidal functors]] as morphisms, 
* [[braided monoidal natural transformations]] as 2-morphisms.

For definitions of all these concepts, see:

* John Baez, [Some definitions everyone should know](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/qg-fall2004/definitions.pdf).

For an elementary introduction to braided monoidal categories using string diagrams, see:

* John Baez and Mike Stay, [Physics, topology, logic and computation: a Rosetta Stone](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/rosetta.pdf).

Eventually we should include all these diagrams here!  Unfortunately I don't know an easy way to do this yet.
