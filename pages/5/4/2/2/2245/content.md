Given a [[field]] $k$, an __algebraic $k$-group__ is a [[group object]] in the category of $k$-[[algebraic variety|varieties]]. An algebraic $k$-group is *linear* if it is a Zariski-closed subgroup of the [[general linear group]] $GL(n,k)$ for some $n$. Another important class are commutative algebraic $k$-groups whose underlying variety is [[projective variety|projective]], namely the *abelian varieties*; in dimension $1$ these are precisely the [[elliptic curve]]s. If $k$ is a [[perfect field]] and $G$ an algebraic $k$-group, the theorem of Chevalley says that there is a unique linear subgroup $H\subset G$ such that $G/H$ is an abelian variety.

The group objects in the category of [[algebraic scheme]]s and [[formal scheme]]s are called (algebraic) *group schemes* and *formal groups*, respectively. One should mention among group schemes 'the infinite-dimensional algebraic groups' of Shafarevich. An algebraic group scheme is *affine* if the underlying scheme is [[affine scheme|affine]]. Algebraic analogues of [[loop group]]s are in the category of [[ind-scheme]]s. All linear algebraic $k$-groups are affine. The category of affine group schemes is the [[opposite category|opposite]] of the category of commutative [[Hopf algebras]].
