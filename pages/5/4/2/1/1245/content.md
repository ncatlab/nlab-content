[[Alexander Grothendieck]] wrote in 1955 a revolutionary article on [[homological algebra]], which was, after almost 3 years in redaction, published in 1957 in Tohoku Math. J.:

In Tohoku, Grothendieck observes that [[module]]s over rings, and [[sheaf|sheaves]] of abelian groups have similar behaviour and that one can develop their homological algebra in a unique way; this includes the axiomatics of what is for the first time called [[abelian category|abelian categories]]. Essentially, they were defined in an earlier paper by Buchsbaum as "exact categories", with different motivation

MacLane had rudiments of the definition of abelian category, around 1950, but it was a bit different and less invariant notion (and under a different name "bicategory"). 

Grothendieck defined universal (co)homological functors and studied special properties of [[resolution]]s, including showing that Godement resolution of sheaves is really an [[injective resolution]]. There is also a section on [[sheaf cohomology]] of spaces with group action. In sheaf theory part of Tohoku, Grothendieck partly continues in spirit of his work from Kansas

One of the most important discoveries in Tohoku is the spectral sequence for the derived functor of the composition of two functors ([[Grothendieck spectral sequence]], which is now more naturally treated in terms of [[triangulated category|triangulated categories]] which Grothendieck invented later with Verdier).
