[[Alexander Grothendieck]] wrote in 1955 a revolutionary article on [[homological algebra]], which was, after almost 3 years in redaction, published in 1957 in T&#244;hoku Mathematical Journal:

In Tohoku, Grothendieck observes that [[module]]s over rings, and [[sheaf|sheaves]] of abelian groups have similar behaviour and that one can develop their homological algebra in a unified way; this includes the axiomatics of what is for the first time called [[abelian category|abelian categories]]. Essentially, they were defined in an earlier paper by Buchsbaum as "exact categories", with different motivation

MacLane had rudiments of the definition of abelian category, around 1950, but it was a bit different and less invariant notion (and under a different name "bicategory"). Tohoku paper also introduces the new weaker notion of an additive category (in which he also postulates the existence of finite products), as well as some additional axioms (including AB5) to abelian categories ensuring existence of sufficiently many injective objects, what is now called a [[Grothendieck category]].

Tohoku paper is the place where the notion of an [[equivalence of categories]] is introduced for the first time. In fact the definition in question is a definition of an adjoint equivalence (unit and counit isomorphisms and the corresponding triangle identities are a part of the definition). This was predating just a little bit Kan's introduction of [[adjoint functor]]s in general. 

Grothendieck defined universal (co)homological functors and studied special properties of [[resolution]]s, including showing that Godement resolution of sheaves is really an [[injective resolution]]. There is also a section on [[sheaf cohomology]] of spaces with group action. In sheaf theory part of Tohoku, Grothendieck partly continues in spirit of his work from Kansas

During his work on Tohoku article in Kansas, Grothendieck did not have access to the manuscript of the 1956 book of Cartan-Eilenberg, about which he heard from his correspondence with [[Serre]]. Thus some of the constructions are overlapping with Cartan-Eilenberg, while being independent. 

One of the most important discoveries in Tohoku is the spectral sequence for the derived functor of the composition of two functors ([[Grothendieck spectral sequence]], which is now more naturally treated in terms of [[triangulated category|triangulated categories]] which Grothendieck invented later with Verdier).
