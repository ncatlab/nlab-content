## Idea

Picard-Fuchs equation is a linear [[ordinary differential equation]] of degree $2g$ for $2g$ periods of a  nonsingular projective curve of genus $g$ over a field $K$ of characteristic $0$. For curves over complex numbers it has been first derived by [[Lazarus Fuchs]]. It may be more abstractly defined using a [[Gauss-Manin connection]] which makes sense in a more general context (beyond curves and algebraic/analytic geometry).

## Literature

A description in the language of [[algebraic geometry]] is in the introduction to

[[mirror map|Mirror maps]] for families of Calabi-Yau are also obtained from corresponding Picard-Fuchs equations.

Doran has clarified in which cases the corresponding mirror map is the Hauptmoduln (j-function) for the elliptic curve:
