## Idea

The _Fukaya category_ of a [[symplectic manifold]] $X$ is an
[[A-âˆž category]] having [[Lagrangian submanifold]]s of $X$ as objects. 
When two Lagrangian submanifolds $L_1$ and $L_2$ of $X$ meet
transversally, their [[hom-object|hom-space]] in the Fukaya category can be roughly
defined as the free vector space generated by the intersection points
$x\in L_1\cap L_2$; one of the main difficulties in giving a rigorous
definition of the Fukaya category in general relies precisely in the
problem of correctly defining the hom-spaces for nontransversal
intersections. As one could expect, the same difficulty carries on to the
definition of the multilinear operations in the Fukaya category: when
Lagrangians $L_1, L_2,\dots,L_{k+1}$ intersect transversally one has
a clear geometric intuition of the multiplication
$$
m_k\colon Hom(L_1,L_2)\otimes\cdots\otimes Hom(L_k,L_{k+1})\to
Hom(L_1,L_{k+1})
$$
in terms of counting pseudo-holomorphic disks into $X$ whose boundaries
lie on the given Lagrangian submanifolds, but when intersections are
nontransverse, the definition of $m_k$ becomes more evasive.

## In quantum field theory and string theory

In [[string theory]], the Fukaya category of a [[symplectic manifold]] $X$ represents the category of [[D-branes]] in the [[A-model]] with [[target space]] $X$. For [[Landau-Ginzburg models]], the category of D-branes for the A-model is described by [[Fukaya-Seidel categories]].

The assignment that sends a [[symplectic manifold]] to its Fukaya category extends to a [[functor]] on a variant of the [[symplectic category]] with [[Lagrangian correspondences]] as morphisms. This is supposed to be the [[FQFT]] incarnation of [[Donaldson theory]]. See at _[[Lagrangian correspondences and category-valued TFT]]_ for more on this.
