## Definition

An _infinitesimally thickened point_ is -- under [[Isbell duality]] -- the formal dual of an $R$-[[algebra]] of the form

$$
  A = R \oplus W
  \,,
$$

where $W$ is a [[module]] of finite rank over $R$ and consisting of nilpotent elements in the algebra $A$.

**Terminology.** An algebra $A$ of this form is also called a **Weil algebra**. Notice that this is unrelated to the notion of Weil algebra in [[Lie theory]]. For more on that, see [[Weil algebra]]. 

## Examples

The smallest nontrivial example is the space dual to the [[ring of dual numbers]]. This is the point with "minimal infintiesimal thickening". 

A class of examples are the spaces $\tilde D(n,r)$ of $r$-tuples of infinitesimal neighbours of the origin of $R^n$, that are each also infinitesimal neighbours of each other. Their Weil algebras of functions are a model for the degree $r$-[[differential form]]s. Details on this are at <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/infinitesimal+object#SpacOfInfSimpl">spaces of infinitesimal k-simplices</a>.


## Applications

The [[site]] of definition for the [[Cahiers topos]] is the category of spaces that are products of an $R^n$ with the dual of a  Weil algebra. So these are infinitesmally thickened [[Cartesian space]]s. These are typically sufficient as test spaces for more general spaces.
