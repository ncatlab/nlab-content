##Idea##

As explained in that entry, '[[quiver]]' is often used to refer to a [[directed graph]], but, as is argued at that entry, this is almost always then used to derive the free category on the that directed graph. The notion of a differential graded quiver, as studied by Lyubashenko and Manzyuk (see reference below), is an enriched analogue of directed graph, enriched over the category of differential graded modules over a commutative ring $k$. (It only uses the underlying category in fact, not the tensor structure). It is introduced _precisely_ to define the analogue of the [[path category]] of a directed graph in this enriched context *but* the structure they define is in fact an [[A-infinity category| linear A-infinity category]].




##Definition##
A _differential graded $k$-quiver_ (or simply _dg-quiver_) $\mathcal{Q}$ is specified by

* a small set of _objects_, denoted $Ob(\mathcal{Q})$;

* for each pair $(x,y)$ of objects of $\mathcal{Q}$, a [[chain complex]] (= graded $k$-module with differential of degree +1) denoted $\mathcal{Q}(x,y)$.



(More work to be done here.)
