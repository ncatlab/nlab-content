In [[topology]] and [[analysis]], the term **compacta** (singular: *compactum*) is used to refer to

* [[compact metrizable spaces]]

or more generally to

* [[compact Hausdorff spaces]]. 

The first usage is more common in the literature.

Slightly different from but closely related to either notion of compacta is that of:

* **[[Eberlein compacta]]**.

A special case of compact Hausdorff spaces are known as

* *[[dyadic compacta]]*.

Analogously, the term **local compacta** (singular: *local compactum*) refers to 

* [[locally compact topological space|locally compact]]$\;$[[metrizable spaces]]

and more generally to 

* [[locally compact Hausdorff spaces]],

and the term **paracompacta** (singular: paracompactum) refers to 

* [[paracompact Hausdorff spaces]]

(noting here that [[metric spaces are paracompact|metric spaces are already paracompact]]).
