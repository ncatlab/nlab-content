In [[topology]] and [[analysis]], the term **compacta** (singular *compactum*) is used to refer to

* [[compact metrizable spaces]]

or more generally to

* [[compact Hausdorff spaces]]. 

The first usage is more common in the literature, but the second is currently more common on the nLab.

Analogously, the term **local compacta** (singular: *local compactum*) refers to 

* [[locally compact topological space|locally compact]]$\;$[[metrizable spaces]]

and more generally to 

* [[locally compact Hausdorff spaces]],

and the term **paracompacta** (singular: paracompactum) refers to 

* [[paracompact Hausdorff spaces]]

(noting here that [[metric spaces are paracompact|metric spaces are already paracompact]]).

Furthermore there are the notions of

* **[[Eberlein compacta]]**

and

* **[[dyadic compacta]]**

for which see there.
