#Definition#

A **von Neumann algebra** is a unital $*$-subalgebra of the algebra of bounded operators on a complex [[Hilbert space]], which is closed in weak operator topology. Clearly, they are automatically closed in norm topology, hence they form a (particularly nice) class of $C^*$-[[C*-algebra|algebras]]. 

#Relevance#

The importance of von Neumann algebras for ([[higher category theory|higher]]) [[category theory]] and topology lays in the evidence that von Neumann algebras are deeply connected with the low dimensional [[quantum field theory]] (2d CFT, TQFT in low dimensions, inclusions of factors, quantum groups and knot theory; elliptic [[cohomology]]: works of Wenzl, Vaughan Jones, Anthony Wasserman, Kerler, Kawahigashi, Ocneanu, Szlachanyi etc.). 

The highlights of their structure theory include the results on classification of factors (A. Connes, 1970s) and theory of inclusions of subfactors (V. Jones). (Hilbert) bimodules over von Neumann algebras have a remarkable tensor product due Connes ([[Connes fusion]]). Following Segal's manifesto

on hypothetical connections between CFT and elliptic cohomology, Stolz and Teichner have made a case for a role von Neumann algebras seem to play in a partial realization of that program:

#Remarks#

* Von Neumann algebras may also be defined abstractly as (abstract) $C^*$-algebras with a predual.

* Von Neumann algebras are also sometimes called $W^*$-algebras; they should not be confused with $W$-algebras in (logarithmic) conformal field theory.

* Combining the previous two remarks, some authors use '$W^*$-algebra' for the abstract concept and 'von Neumann algebra' for the concrete concept.  Equivalently, then, a von Neumann algebra is a $W^*$-algebra equipped with a free action on a Hilbert space (and it\'s a theorem that any $W^*$-algebra may be so equipped).
