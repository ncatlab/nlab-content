## Definition

For a _[[commutative ring]]_ one defines a __radical $\sqrt{I}$ of an ideal__ $I\subset R$ as an ideal 
$$
\sqrt{I} = \{ r\in R \,|\, \exists n\in \mathbb{N}, r^n\in I \}
$$

An ideal is called a _radical ideal_ if it is equal to its own radical.
 
The [[nilradical|Nilradical]] of a commutative ring is the radical of the $0$ ideal.

For a [[noncommutative ring]] or an [[associative algebra]] there are many competing notions of a radical of a ring such as [[Jacobson radical]], Levitzky radical, and sometimes of radicals of ideals or, more often, arbitrary modules of a ring. 

## Properties

Each of the notions of radical mentioned above are functorial, and some of the abstract properties of such functors are used in noncommutative localization theory, when defining so called *radical functors*. Classically these were considered for module categories ${ }_R Mod$ (left modules over a ring $R$, but there are generalizations for arbitrary [[Grothendieck categories]], and there are also some notions of radical for nonadditive categories.  See [Shulgeifer 60](#Shulgeifer60). 

We define here radical functors on ${ }_R Mod$, but warn that there are some terminological discrepancies across the literature. 

However they are defined, all notions of radical involve [[additive functor|additive]] [[subfunctors]] $i: \sigma \hookrightarrow 1_{ _R Mod}$ of the identity on ${ }_R Mod$, the additive category of left $R$-modules. [[natural transformation|Naturality]] of $i$ implies the equation $i \circ \sigma i = i \circ i\sigma$, whence $\sigma i = i\sigma$ by [[monomorphism|monicity]] of $i$. Some authors refer to these as *preradical functors* (e.g., [Mirhosseinkhani 2010](#Mirhosseinkhani2010)). 

Such a functor $\sigma: {}_R Mod\to {}_R Mod$ is __idempotent__ if $\sigma i = i\sigma: \sigma \to \sigma\sigma$ is an isomorphism, and is called a _radical functor_ if in addition $\sigma(M/\sigma(M))=0$ for all $M$ in ${}_R Mod$. Note however that some authors call *this* a *preradical functor*, and define a radical functor to be such a preradical functor that is left exact. 

Following [Goldman 1969](#Goldman1969), a left exact additive subfunctor of the identity is called an __idempotent kernel functor__. Observe that such is idempotent by the calculation

$$
\sigma \sigma M = \sigma Ker(M\to M/\sigma M) = Ker (\sigma M\to \sigma(M/\sigma M)) = Ker(\sigma M\to M\to M/\sigma M) = \sigma M
$$

where in the last step, we used that $\sigma$ is a subfunctor of the identity, hence the compositions $\sigma M\hookrightarrow M\to M/\sigma M$ and $\sigma M\to \sigma(M/\sigma M)\to M/\sigma M$ coincide. 

However, beware that other authors call a left exact additive subfunctor $\sigma: {}_R Mod\to {}_R Mod$ of the identity functor a [[kernel functor]], and then call a kernel functor $\sigma$ an *idempotent kernel functor* if $\sigma(M/\sigma(M))=0$ for all $M$ in ${}_R Mod$. In other words, their idempotent kernel functors coincide with what other authors call radical functors in the strong (left exact) sense above.

## Examples

Example ([Bueso-Jara-Verschoren 95 2.3.4](#BuesoJaraVerschoren95)): Let $I$ be a two-sided ideal in a ring. Define a functor $\sigma : {}_R Mod\to {}_R Mod$ on objects by $\sigma M = \{ m\in M\,|\, \exists n, I^n M = 0\}$; it is left exact and idempotent. If $I$ is finitely generated as left $R$-ideal (i.e. as a left $R$-submodule of $R$) then $I$ is a left exact radical functor. It is clear that the formula for $\sigma M$ reminds the definition of the radical of an ideal of a commutative ring.  

Nonexample: the subfunctor of identity which to any module $M$ assigns its [[socle]] is left exact but not a radical functor.
