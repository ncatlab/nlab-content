A **cartesian closed category** (sometimes: **ccc**) is a category with finite [[product|products]] which is [[closed category|closed]] with respect to its [[cartesian monoidal category|cartesian monoidal structure]].

Since in such a category, the product functors $A\times -$ have right adjoints, they preserve all colimits.  In particular, a cartesian closed category is a [[distributive category]].

Any [[topos]] or [[quasitopos]], such as [[Set]], is cartesian closed.  [[Cat]] is also cartesian closed.  Many categories of [[nice topological space|nice topological spaces]] are also cartesian closed.

The [[internal logic]] of cartesian closed categories is the [[typed lambda calculus]].
