[[!redirects cartesian closed categories]]

A __cartesian closed category__ (sometimes: __ccc__) is a category with finite [[products]] which is [[closed monoidal category|closed]] with respect to its [[cartesian monoidal category|cartesian monoidal structure]].

Since in such a category, the product functors $A \times -$ have [[right adjoints]], they preserve all [[colimits]].  In particular, a cartesian closed category is a [[distributive category]].

Any [[topos]] or [[quasitopos]], such as [[Set]], is cartesian closed.  [[Cat]] is also cartesian closed.  Many [[nice category of spaces|nice categories of topological spaces]] are also cartesian closed, particularly the [[convenient category of topological spaces|convenient categories of spaces]].

The [[internal logic]] of cartesian closed categories is the [[typed lambda calculus]].
