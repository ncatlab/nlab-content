## Idea

Poincar&#233;'s homology sphere is a [[closed manifold|closed]] [[3-manifold]] with the same [[homology]] as the [[3-sphere]] but with a [[fundamental group]] which is non-trivial.

## Realizations

...the [[coset space]] $SU(2)/2I$ of the [[special unitary group]] in [[dimension]] 2 by the [[binary icosahedral group]].
