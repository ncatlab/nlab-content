There is currently a good discussion about _Foundations_, in the mathematical sense, in the context of [[category theory]] over on the $n$Caf&#233;, starting somewhere around [here](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/11/coalgebraically_thinking.html#c020425).

This would be a good topic to eventually summarize here.

Todd Trimble has a nice exposition of the issue of foundations of set theory [here](http://topologicalmusings.wordpress.com/2008/09/01/zfc-and-etcs-elementary-theory-of-the-category-of-sets/).

This set of slides gives an interesting discussion about the relation between categories and foundations:
