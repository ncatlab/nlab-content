#Summary#

The book discusses the theory of [[presheaf|presheaves]] and [[sheaf|sheaves]] with an eye towards their application in [[homological algebra]] and with an outlook on [[stack]]s.

A self-contained introduction of the basics of [[presheaf]]-categories with detailed discussion of [[representable functor]]s and the corresponding notions of [[limit]]s, [[colimit]]s, [[adjoint functor]]s and [[ind-object]]s forms the first third of the book.

The second part describes central concepts and tools of modern category-theoretic [[homological algebra]] in terms of [[derived category|derived]] [[triangulated category|triangulated categories]].

The last part merges these two threads in a discussion of [[sheaf|sheaves]] in general and [[abelian sheaf|abelian sheaves]] in particular.

A last section provides an outlook to the theory of [[stack]]s. 

In fact, the organization and emphasis of the book (for instance the conception of the passing from [[presheaf|presheaves]] to [[sheaf|sheaves]] as a [[localization]]) makes it a suitable 1-categorical preparation for the [[infinity-category|infinity-categorical]] discussion of sheaves in

* J. Lurie, [[Higher Topos Theory]]

and of triangulated categories, i.e. [[stable (infinity,1)-category|stable infinity-categories]], in 

* J. Lurie, [[Stable Infinity-Categories]]
