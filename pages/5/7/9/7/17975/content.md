## Idea

A model for [[dark matter]] made up of massive but extremely light [[particles]], whose [[de Broglie wavelength]] is at the scale of galaxies. 

The idea is that on scales above that of galaxies, the predictions of fuzzy dark matter agree with the standard cold dark matter models that work exceptionally well on [[cosmology|cosmological scales]], while on scales of the size of galaxies the [[quantum physics|quantum]] properties of these light particles become relevant snd change their effect just so as to fix the problems (see also [[MOND]]) that standard cold dark matter models have on these scales.

A natural candidate for such ultra-light particles are [[axions]].
