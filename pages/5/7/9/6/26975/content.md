## Idea

An *invariant set* is a [[subset]] which is [[invariant]] under a given [[action]] of a [[group]] or a [[monoid]]. 

## Definition

Let $X$ be a [[set]], let $M$ be a [[monoid]] (or a [[group]]), and consider an [[action]] of $M$ on $X$. (For each $m\in M$, denote the resulting action on $X$ again by $m:X\to X$.)

A [[subset]] $S$ of $X$ is called **[[invariant]]** if and only if for each $m\in M$, $m^{-1}(S)=S$.
Equivalently, if for every $x\in X$ we have that $x\in S$ if and only if $f(x)\in S$. 

Note that the *[[elements]]* ("points") of an invariant set need not themselves be [[fixed points]]: they might move under the action (but they remain in the set $S$). For example, for rotations in the plane, any circle centered at the origin is an invariant set, but each point in each nontrivial circle is not a fixed point.

### Variations of the definition

Since the original definition was given for the case of [[group actions]], which are invertible, there are a number of variants of the same definition which differ for the case of arbitrary monoids. 
In particular, sometimes one calls a subset $S\subseteq X$ *invariant* if and only if $m^{-1}(S)\subseteq S$, i.e. if for every $x\in S$, $f(x)\in S$ as well. (Without requiring that if $f(x)\in S$, then $x\in S$.) 
In other words, it is a set "which we cannot leave" under the specified action. 
Sometimes such a set is called an *absorbing set* instead. (But that term may itself be used for other concepts, to make matters even worse.)

Also, in different categories than [[Set]], similar variations of the notion of invariant set are given:

* In [[topology]], given a [[continuous function|continuous]] action, one is often interested in invariant [[closed sets]];
* In [[probability theory]], one is often interested in invariant [[measurable sets]];
* In [[differential geometry]], one is often interested in invariant [[submanifolds]],

...and so on.


## Examples

* Each [[orbit]] of a [[group action]] is an invariant set. Moreover, a set is invariant if and only if it is a (possibly empty) union of orbits.

* In [[probability theory]], an [[exchangeable event]] is a [[measurable subset]] which is invariant under finite [[permutations]], and a [[tail event]] is invariant under [[shifts]].


## Invariant sigma-algebras

Let $X$ be a [[measurable set]]. Let $M$ be a [[monoid]] (or [[group]]), and consider an action of $M$ on $X$ via measurable functions $m:X\to X$.

A [[measurable subset]] $A\subseteq X$ is called **invariant** if and only if for every $m\in M$, $m^{-1}(A)=A$. 

Invariant sets form naturally a [[sigma-algebra]], often called the **invariant sigma-algebra**. 

The [[exchangeable sigma-algebra]] and the [[tail sigma-algebra]] are examples of this. (Sometimes one uses the almost sure versions, see [below](#almost_surely_invariant_sets).)

The invariant sigma-algebra gives a [[colimit]] of the [[action]] of $M$ in the [[Stoch|category of Markov kernels]] ([MP'23](#markov_ergodic)). More precisely, denote by $X_inv$ the set $X$ together with the invariant sigma-algebra, and denote by $q:X\to X_inv$ the kernel [[Markov kernel#kernels_from_deterministic_functions|induced by]] the set-theoretic identity. 
Then the $(X_inv,q)$ forms a universal [[cocone]] (i.e. [[colimit]]), meaning that for every kernel $k:X\to Y$ satisfying $k\circ m=k$, (i.e. right-invariant under the action of $m$), there exists a unique kernel $u:X_inv\to Y$ making the following diagram commute,
\begin{tikzcd}[%
nodes={scale=1.25}, arrows={thick},%
column sep=large,%
]
X \ar{dd}[swap]{\delta_m} \ar{dr}[swap]{q} \ar{drr}{k} \\
 & X_\mathrm{inv} \ar[dashed, near start]{r}{u} & Y \\
X \ar{ur}{q} \ar{urr}[swap]{k}
\end{tikzcd}
where $\delta_m$ is the [[Markov kernel#kernels_from_deterministic_functions|kernel induced by]] $m$.
The kernel $u$ has the same entries as $k$: by invariance, $k$ is indeed measurable for the sigma-algebra of invariant sets.

Note that $X_inv$ is *not* the colimit simply in the [[Meas|category of measurable functions]]: the colimit in that case also takes a set-theoretic quotient. 
(In the category of kernels, however, the set-theoretic quotient and $X_inv$ are isomorphic. This can be seen from the fact that Markov kernels are [[Kleisli morphisms]] of the [[Giry monad]] on [[Meas]], and that [[left adjoints preserve colimits]].)


### For stochastic actions

A monoid $M$ can also act stochastically on $X$, via [[Markov kernels]] $k_m:X\to X$ such that for all $x\in X$ and all measurable $A\subseteq X$,
$$
k_m(A|x) \;=\; 1_A(x) \;=\; \begin{cases}
1 & x\in A ; \\
0 & x\notin A ,
\end{cases}
$$
and
$$
k_{m\cdot n}(A|x) \;=\; \int_X k_m(A|x')\,k_n(d x'|x) .
$$
(This is equivalently a [[functor]] $B M\to Stoch$, see the discussion at [[invariant measure#categorytheoretic_description|invariant measure]].)

In this case, an **invariant set** is a measurable set $A$ such that for all $m\in M$ and $x\in X$, 
$$
k(A|x) \;=\; 1_A(x) \;=\; \begin{cases}
1 & x\in A ; \\
0 & x\notin A .
\end{cases}
$$
These sets form again a sigma-algebra, generalizing the case of actions via functions.

This sigma-algebra is in general *not* a colimit in a category of kernels ([EP'23](#ergodic_dagger), Example 3.9). 
See however the almost sure case [below](#almost_surely_invariant_sets).


### Almost surely invariant sets

For [[invariant measure|stationary]] actions, i.e. for actions of $M$ on a [[probability space]] $(X,p)$ via [[measure-preserving functions]], (or equivalently, for measurable actions equipped with an [[invariant measure]] $p$, we can define a notion of **almost surely invariant set**: a measurable subset $A\subseteq X$ such that 
$$
p(A\setminus m^{-1}(A)) \;=\; p(m^{-1}(A)\setminus A) \;=\; 0 .
$$
Equivalently, if for all measurable $S\subseteq X$, 
$$
p(S\cap m^{-1}(A)) \;=\; p(S\cap A) .
$$

More generally, if we have [[Markov kernel#measurepreserving_kernels|measure-preserving kernels]] $k_m:(X,p)\to(X,p)$, we call **almost surely invariant** a measurable subset $A\subseteq X$ such that for all $m\in M$,
$$
k_m(A|x) \;=\; 1_A(x) \;=\; \begin{cases}
1 & x\in A ; \\
0 & x\notin A 
\end{cases}
$$
for *$p$-almost all* $x\in X$. Equivalently, if for all measurable $S\subseteq X$, 
$$
\int_S k_m(A|x) \,p(d x) \;=\; p(S\cap A) .
$$

These sets form again a [[sigma-algebra]], called the **almost surely invariant sigma-algebra** (or sometimes, possibly confusingly, again **invariant sigma-algebra**). 

Similarly to the deterministic case, this sigma-algebra is the [[colimit]] of the action of $M$ in the [[category of couplings]] ([EP'23](#ergodic_dagger), Section 3.1).


### Further properties

* By definition, every [[ergodic measure]] is [[zero-one measure|zero-one]] on invariant sets. 
* The [[ergodic theorem]] says that, in some cases, [[empirical means]] of [[random variables]] on a [[stationary system]] tend to [[conditional expectations]] w.r.t. the invariant sigma-algebra.
