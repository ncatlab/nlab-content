(Co)homological theories for [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]] have led [[Grothendieck]] to propose a theory of [[motive]]s which has partly been realized (e.g. in its triangulated and dg-versions) so far. One systematic approach is to study the homotopy theory in this context, namely $\mathbb{A}^1$-[[A1-homotopy theory|homotopy theory]]. However in practice, one is led to calculate invariants and it is difficult to find new computable cases; the study of algebraic cycles in higher codimension is notoriously difficult, and the Chow groups are difficult to compute. Somewhat more accessible is [[algebraic K-theory]]. This is unlike the classical situation where in addition many other extraordinary (co)homology theories are at hand. In the abstract setup, Voevodsky and others did study more general extraodrinary cohomology theories, but down-to-Earth examples are difficult to find. This was roughly the motivation for two people -- [[Marc Levine]] and [[Fabien Morel]] -- to construct in a single effort the notion of **algebraic cobordism**, which is an analogue of complex cobordism for algebraic varieties. Many of the tools from Quillen's and Novikov's work on complex cobordism, like Lazard's ring and [[formal group]]s, play a major role. 

Algebraic cobordism is an axiomatically defined **oriented Borel--Moore homology theory**, where 'oriented' stands for the existence of correponding [[Chern class]]es. A very nontrivial theorem shows the existence of such a theory; and the theory became soon of significant practical use. The fact that $\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy theory is not used ---that is, the constructions are more direct--- is an advantage. 

The standard references are pretty readable and complete for a general algebraic geometry audience.
