There is also a rigid analytic version __analytic Milnor fiber__, which is a rigid variety over the [[nonarchimedean field]] of complex Laurent series associated to a complex hypersurface singularity. It has been used in the study of motivic zeta function via motivic integration on rigid varieties in
