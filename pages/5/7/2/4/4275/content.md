## Definition

For $R$ a [[ring]], an $R$-valued **genus** is a ring [[homomorphism]]

$$
  \sigma : \Omega_n  \to R
$$

from the [[bordism ring]].


The cobordism ring here may be replaced by rings of cobordisms with extra structure.  

## Higher category theory interpretation

The notion of genus finds its natural interpretation in [[higher category theory]], where it is refined to a morphism of [[symmetric monoidal (infinity,1)-category|symmetric monoidal]] [[∞-groupoid]]s

$$
  \sigma : Bord_{(\infty,\infty)} \to S
$$

from the [[(∞,n)-category of cobordisms]] for $n \to \infty$ to a [[ring spectrum]] $S$.

See [[cobordism ring]] for more.

## Examples

* The [[Euler characteristic]] $X \mapsto \chi(X)$ is close to being 
  a genus, but is _not_ [[cobordism]] invariant
  
  (this is the [[index]] of the [[Dirac operator]] $D = d + d^\dagger$)

* The [[signature genus]];

* The [[A-hat genus]] is the [[index of a Dirac operator]] coming from 
  a [[spin bundle]];

* The [[elliptic genus]] or [[Witten genus]] may be interpreted as the
  index of a [[Dirac operator]] on [[loop space]].
