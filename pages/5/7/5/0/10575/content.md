In [[homotopy type theory]], the [[introduction rule]] is a [[dependent function 
$$\operatorname{refl} : \prod_{a : A} \big( a =_A a \big)$$
called **reflexivity**, which says that every element of $A$ is equal to itself (in a specified way). We regard $\operatorname{refl}_a}$ as being the constant path at the point $a$.
