If $A$ and $B$ are [[algebraic theory|algebraic theories]], the algebraic theory $A\otimes B$ is characterized by the fact that its models can be identified with $A$-models in $B Mod$, or equivalently as $B$-models in $A Mod$. There are maps of theories $A\to A\otimes B$ and $B\to A\otimes B$ which are universal for maps of theories $A\to C$ and $B\to C$ (for any theory $C$) whose images commute.
