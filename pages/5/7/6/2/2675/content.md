  > "At the beginning of this century a self-destructive democratic principle was advanced in mathematics &lbrack;which&rbrack; led mathematicians to break from physics and to separate from all other sciences. In the eyes of all normal people, they were transformed into a sinister priestly caste of a dying religion, like Druids, parasitic on science and technology, recruiting acolytes in the mathematical schools by Zombie-like mental subjection. Bizarre questions like [[Fermat's last theorem|Fermat's problem]] or problems on sums of prime numbers were elevated to supposedly central problems of mathematics."

  > "Mathematics is a part of physics. Physics is an experimental science, a part of natural science. Mathematics is the part of physics where experiments are cheap.

  > The Jacobi identity (which forces the altitudes of a triangle to meet in a point) is an experimental fact in the same way as the fact that the earth is round (that is, homeomorphic to a ball). But it can be discovered with less expense. 

  > In the middle of the twentieth century an attempt was made to separate physics and mathematics. The consequences turned out to be catastrophic. Whole generations of mathematicians grew up without knowing half of their science and, of course, in total ignorance of any other sciences. They first began teaching their ugly scholastic pseudo-mathematics to their students, then to schoolchildren (forgetting Hardy’s warning that ugly mathematics has no permanent place under the sun).

  > Since scholastic mathematics that is cut off from physics is fit neither for teaching nor for application in any other science, the result was a universal hatred of mathematicians, both on the part of the poor schoolchildren (some of whom in the meantime became ministers) and of the users.

  > &lbrack;...&rbrack;

  > A teacher of mathematics who has not got to grips with at least some of the volumes of the [[Course of Theoretical Physics|course]] by Landau and Lifshitz will then become a relic like the person nowadays who does not know the difference between an open and a closed set."

  > "All mathematics is divided into three parts: [[cryptography]] (paid for by CIA, KGB and the like), [[hydrodynamics]] (supported by manufacturers of atomic submarines) and [[classical mechanics|celestial mechanics]] (financed by military and other institutions dealing with missiles, such as NASA).

  > Cryptography has generated [[number theory]], [[algebraic geometry]] over [[finite fields]], [[algebra]]", [[combinatorics]] and [[computers]].

  > Hydrodynamics procreated [[complex analysis]], [[partial differential equations]], [[Lie groups]] and algebra theory, [[cohomology theory]] and scientific [[computing]].

  > Celestial mechanics is the origin of [[dynamical systems]], [[linear algebra]], [[topology]], [[variational calculus]] and [[symplectic geometry]].

  > The existence and mysterious relations between all these different domains is the most striking and delightful feature of mathematics (having no rational explanation)."

  > "[[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] tried to predict the future development of mathematics and to influence it by [[Hilbert's problems|his Problems]]. The development of mathematics in the 20th century has followed a different path. The most important achievements -- the flourishing of [[homotopy theory]] and of [[differential topology]], the [[geometry|geometrisation]] of all branches of mathematics, its fusion with [[theoretical physics]], the discovery of the algorithmically undecidable problems and the appearance of [[computers]] -- all this went in a different (if not opposite) direction.

  > The influence of [[Henri Poincaré|H. Poincaré]] and of [[Hermann Weyl|H. Weyl]] on the science of the 20th century was much deeper. To Poincaré, who created modern mathematics, [[topology]] and [[dynamical systems]] theory, the future of mathematics lay in the development of [[mathematical physics]], oriented to the description of the [[relativity|relativistic]] and [[quantum physics|quantum]] phenomena."
