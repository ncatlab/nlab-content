> In this paper we solve a contact non-squeezing conjecture proposed by Eliashberg, Kim and Polterovich.
Let BR be the open ball of radius $R$ in $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ and let $\mathbb{R}^{2n}\times S^1$ be the prequantization space equipped with the standard contact structure. Following [[Dmitry Tamarkin|Tamarkin]]â€™s idea, we apply [[microlocal analysis|microlocal]] category methods to prove that if $R$ and $r$ satisfy $1\leq \pi r^2 \lt \pi R^2$, then it is impossible to squeeze the contact ball $B_R\times S^1$ into $B_r\times S^1$ via compactly supported contact isotopies.
