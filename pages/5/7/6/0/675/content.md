An ambient category $C$ is just a category from which [[internalization|internal structures]] take their objects and structure morphisms.

If $C$ has extra structure, like being (semi)abelian or a site, then one can do extra things (a bit imprecise for now. -[[David Roberts|David]])

If you mean extra things in [[internal category|internal categories]] (which this page initially focussed on), you should probably put them on that page.  &#8212;[[Toby Bartels|Toby]]

More generally an ambient category could be seen as a 'universe of discourse', as when $C$ is a [[topos]]; see [[foundations]].
