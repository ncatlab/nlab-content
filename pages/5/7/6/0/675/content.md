An ambient category $C$ is usually just a category from which [[internal category|internal categories and groupoids]] take their object of arrows, object of objects and structure morphisms. 

The internal functors and natural transformations also have as data arrows from the ambient category.


If $C$ has extra structure, like being (semi)abelian or a site, then one can do extra things (a bit imprecise for now. -[[David Roberts|David]])

More generally an ambient category could be seen as a 'universe of discourse', as when $C$ is a topos. See also [[internalization]].
