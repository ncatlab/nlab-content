## Idea

A variant of a [[Morse function]] that yields a contractible space of such functions.

## Definition

A __generalized Morse function__ $f$ on a [[smooth manifold]] is a smooth real-valued function $f$ whose [[critical points]] either have a nondegenerate [[Hessian]] or a [[Hessian]] with a 1-dimensional kernel $K$ such that the third derivative of $f$ along $K$ is nonzero.

The [[Morse lemma]] shows that in a neighborhood of such a critical point we can pick a coordinate system in which $f$ has the form
$$f(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=x_1^2+\cdots+x_k^2-x_{k+1}^2-\cdots-x_n^2$$
or
$$f(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=x_1^2+\cdots+x_{k-1}^2+x_k^3-x_{k+1}^2-\cdots-x_n^2,$$
respectively.

## Properties

The space of framed generalized Morse functions is contractible.
For a proof, see Eliashberg–Mishachev or Kupers.

This property distinguishes framed generalized Morse functions from ordinary [[Morse functions]], whose space is not contractible.
