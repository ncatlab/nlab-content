#Idea#

A **tricategory** is a particular [[algebraic definition of higher category|algebraic]] notion of _weak_ [[3-category]].  The idea is that a tricategory is a category _weakly_ [[enriched category|enriched]] over [[Bicat]]: the [[hom-object|hom-objects]] of a tricategory are [[bicategories]], and the associativity and unity laws of [[enriched category|enriched categories]] hold only up to coherent equivalence.

This was refined in the thesis

which is probably the best current starting point to read about tricategories and from where to take pointers to the original work by Gordon-Power-Street.
