### General

(...)


### For mathematical structures
 {#ForMathematicalStructure}

According to [Lawvere 1984](#Lawvere84), [[codiscrete objects]], i.e. those in the [[image]] of a [[right adjoint]] to a [[forgetful functor]], may be though of as "chaotic" with repect to whatever [[mathematical structure]] was forgotten by the forgetful functor.

This convention matches/subsumes more-or-less common  terminology such as *[[chaotic topology]]* or *[[chaotic groupoid]]*.

### Concerning mathematical structure
 {#ConcerningMathematicalStructures}

The terminology "chaotic" for [[codiscrete objects]] goes back to 

* [[SGA4|SGA4-1, 1.1.4]] (1972)

where it is used for [[Grothendieck topologies]], from which it was, apparently, adapted to [[chaotic topologies]] on [[topological spaces]].

General formalization of the concept in terms of [[right adjoints]] to [[forgetful functors]] is due to:
