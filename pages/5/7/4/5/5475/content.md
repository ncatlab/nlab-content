## Definition

A [[∞-connected (∞,1)-topos]] 

$$
  (\Pi \dashv \Delta \dashv \Gamma) : \mathbf{H} \to \infty Grpd
$$ 

is called **strongly connected** if $\Pi$ preserves [[finite limit|finite]] [[(∞,1)-limit]]s.

Similarly for an $n$-connected $(n,1)$-topos.

For $n = 1$ this yields the notion of [[totally connected topos]].
