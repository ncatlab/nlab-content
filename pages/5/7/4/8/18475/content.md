## Idea

The [[AdS-CFT correspondence]] applies _exactly_ only to a few highly symmetric [[quantum field theories]], notably to [[N=4 D=4 super Yang-Mills theory]]. However, it still applies in adjusted form when moving away from these special points in field theory space (e.g [Park 2022](#Park22)).

For instance [[quantum chromodynamics]] (one sector of the [[standard model of particle physics]]) is crucially different from but still similar enough to [[N=4 D=4 super Yang-Mills theory]] that some of its [[observables]], in particular otherwise intractable [[non-perturbative effects]], have been argued to be usefully approximated by [[AdS-CFT]]-type dual [[gravity]]-observables, for instance the [[shear viscosity]] of the [[quark-gluon plasma]]. This is hence also called the _[[AdS/QCD correspondence]]_.

Similarly, as far as systems in [[condensed matter physics]] are described well by some [[effective field theory]], one may ask whether this, in turn, is usefully related to [[gravity]] on some [[anti de-Sitter spacetime]] and use this to study the solid state system, notably its [[non-perturbative effects]]. This area goes under the name _AdS/CMT_.

[[Andreas Karch]] writes [here](http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=9426#comment-226376):

> These anomalous transport coefficients have first been calculated in AdS/CFT. The relevant references are [8], [9] and [10] in the Son/Surowka paper. In the AdS/CFT calculations these particular transport coefficients only arise due to Chern-Simons terms, which are the bulk manifestation of the field theory anomalies. At that point it was obvious to many of us that there should be a purely field theory based calculation, only using anomalies, that can derive these terms. Son and Surowka knew about this. They were sitting next door to me when they started these calculations. Many of us tried to find these purely field theory based arguments and failed. Son and Surowka succeeded.

> If you ask anyone serious about applying AdS/CFT to strongly coupled field theories why they are doing this, they would (hopefully) give you an answer along the lines of "AdS/CFT provides us with toy models of strongly coupled dynamics. While the field theories that have classical AdS duals are rather special, we can still learn important qualitative insights and find new ways to think about strongly coupled field theories." Once AdS/CFT stumbles on a new phenomenon in these solvable toy models, we want to go back to see whether we can understand it without the crutch of having to rely on AdS/CFT. Any result that only applies in theories with holographic dual is somewhat limited in its applications. In this sense, anomalous transport is a poster child for what AdS/CFT can be used for: a new phenomenon that had been missed completely by people studying field theory gets uncovered by studying these toy models. Once we knew what to look for, a purely field theoretic argument was found that made the AdS/CFT derivation obsolete.

> This is applied AdS/CFT as it should be. Solvable examples exhibit new connections which then can be proven to be correct more generally and are not limited to the toy models that were used to uncover them.

Similarly [Hartnoll-Lucas-Sachdev 16, p. 8](#HartnollLucasSachdev16):

> Our main objective here
is to make clear that explicit examples of the duality are
known in various dimensions and that they are found by
using string theory as a bridge between quantum field
theory and gravity.

## Properties

### Description by tensor networks

Discussion of [[renormalization]] and [[entangled states]]  of [[non-perturbative effects]] in [[solid state physics]] proceeds via [[tensor networks]] ([Swingle 09](#Swingle09), [Swingle 13](#Swingle13)) and the resulting discovery of the relation to [[holographic entanglement entropy]].

In this context, a _[[tensor network]]_ is a _[[string diagram]] [[concept with an attitude|with an attitude]], in that it is (just) a [[string diagram]], but with 

1. the [[tensor product]] of all its external [[objects]] regarded as a [[space of states]] of a [[quantum system]];

1. the [[element]] in that [[tensor product]] defined by the string diagram regarded a a [[state]] ([[wave function]]) of that quantum system.

For instance, if $\mathfrak{g}$ is a [[metric Lie algebra]] (with [[string diagram]]-notation as shown [there](metric+Lie+algebra#Definition)), and with each [[tensor product]]-power of its [[dual vector space]] regarded as [[Hilbert space]], hence as a [[space of quantum states]], via the given [[inner product]] on $\mathfrak{g}$, then an example of a _tree tensor network state_ is the following:

<center>
<img src="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/TensorNetworkStateFromMetricLieAlgebra.jpg" width="300">
</center>

The [[quantum states]] arising this way are generically highly [[entangled state|entangled]]: roughly they are the more entangled the more [[vertices]] there are in the corresponding tensor network.

Tree tensor network states in the form of [[Bruhat-Tits trees]] play a special role in the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]], either as

1. a kind of [[lattice QFT]]-approximation to an actual [[boundary field theory|boundary]] [[CFT]] [[quantum state]], 

1. as the [[p-adic geometry|p-adic geometric]] incarnation of [[anti de Sitter spacetime]] in the [[p-adic AdS/CFT correspondence]],

1. as a reflection of actual [[crystal]]-site quantum states in [[AdS/CFT in solid state physics]]:

</center>

> graphics from [[schreiber:Differential Cohomotopy implies intersecting brane observables|Sati-Schreiber 19c]]

For [[Bruhat-Tits tree]] [[tensor network states]] one finds that the [[holographic entanglement entropy]] of the tensor subspace associated with an [[interval]] on the [[boundary]] becomes proportional, for large number of [[vertices]], to the [[hyperbolic space|hyperbolic]] bulk boundary [[length]] of the segment of the tree network that ends on this interval, according to the [[Ryu-Takayanagi formula]] ([PYHP 15, Theorem 2](#PYHP15)). For more on this see [below](#ForHolographicEntanglementEntropy).
