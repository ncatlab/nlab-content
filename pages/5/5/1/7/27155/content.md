## Idea

A notion of [[vector space]] in [[condensed mathematics]].

[[Peter Scholze]], in an answer to [[David Roberts]]' [question at Mathoverflow](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/467433/clausen-scholzes-theorem-9-1-of-analytic-pdf-in-view-of-light-condensed-sets/467462#467462), says

> For many (but definitely not all) applications to geometry over the real numbers, the gaseous real vector spaces work just as well, and their theory is much easier to get off the ground than liquid real vector spaces. (Roughly speaking, complex- or real-analytic spaces are fine with gaseous vector spaces, smooth manifolds not so much. The reason is that tensor products of spaces of holomorphic or real-analytic functions behave correctly under the gaseous tensor product, but tensor products of spaces of $C^\infty$-functions are only correct under the liquid tensor product.)
