#Idea#

A _combinatorial spectrum_ is to a [[spectrum]] of [[topological space]]s as a [[simplicial set]] is to a [[topological space]]: it is a graded set that behaves like a set of simplices constituting a space, where the special property is that the simplices are not just in non-negative degree $n \in \mathbb{N}$ but in all integral degrees $n \in \mathbb{Z}$.

#Definition#

A **simplicial spectrum** is 

* a sequence $E = \{E_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{Z}}$ of [[pointed set]]s 

* equipped for each $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $i \in \mathbb{N}$ with

  * morphisms of [[pointed set]]s $d_i : E_n \to E_{n-1}$ called **face maps**;

  * morphisms of [[pointed set]]s $s_i : E_n \to E_{n+1}$ called **degeneracy maps**

* such that

  * the usual [[simplicial set|simplicial identities]] are satisfied;

  * each simplex has only finitely many faces different from the point of $E_{n-1}$: i.e. for every $x \in E_n$ there are only finitely many $i \in \mathbb{N}$ for which $d_i(x)$ is not the point.

#Examples#

The standard [[simplicial set]]s corresponding to the standard [[simplex|simplices]] have their analogs for simplicial spectra. . The difference is that regarded as a spectrum the $k$-simplex may sit in any degree $n \in \mathbb{N}$, not necessarily in degree $k$.

* **The $(k+1)$-simplex in degree $n$.** For each integer $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $k \in \mathbb{N}$ there is a spectrum $\Delta^{(n,k)}$ which is _generated_ from a single element $x \in E_n$ subject to the relation that $d_i x = *$ for $i \gt k$.  So this is something with $(k+1)$-faces, hence looking like a $k$-simplex, but sitting in degree $n$. 

  * $\partial \Delta^{(n,k)}$ is the sub-spectrum of $\Delta^{(n,k)}$ generated by the faces $d_i x$. This is the **boundary** of the $k$-simplex in degree $n$.

  * For $k = 0$ the spectrum $\Delta^{(n,0)} = S^n$ is the **$n$-sphere**-spectrum.

  * $\Lambda^{(n,k)}_j$ for $0 \leq j \leq k$ is the sub-spectrum of $\Delta^{(n,k)}$ generated from all the faces $d_i x$ except $d_j x$. This is the  $j$th **horn** of the $k$-simplex in degree $n$. Compare with the [[horn]] of a [[simplex]]

#Discussion#

A previous version of this entry triggered the following discussion:

+--{: .query}
[[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: Are you sure about that last condition?  I remember a condition more like "for each $x\in E_n$ there is some finite $m \lt n$ such that all faces of $x$ in $E_m$ are the basepoint.

[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: on the bottom of page 437 in the reference by Brown it says: "each simplex of $E$ has only finitely many faces different from $*$".

I see that my original phrasing reflected this only very imprecisely. I have tried to improve that now. But it also seems that this condition $m \lt n$ which you mention is not implied by Brown(?) In particular, it seems this condition does not harmoize with the fact that $n$ may be negative.

But this looks like the condition which does appear in the definition of the $n$-simplex spectra (next page of Brown). I have added that in the list of examples now.

Another question: what's the established term for these things here? I made up both "combinatorial spectrum" and "simplicial spectrum" after reading Brown's articl, which just calls this "spectrum" without qualification. I am tending to think that "simplicial spectrum" would be a good term.

Related to that: what's a more recent good reference on these combinatorial version of spectra?
