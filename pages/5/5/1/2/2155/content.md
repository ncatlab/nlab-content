A __Cartesian space__ is a space of the form $\mathbb{R}^n$, the $n$-fold [[Cartesian product]] of the [[real line]] $\mathbb{R}$, where $n$ is some [[natural number]] (possibly zero).

In particular:
*  $\mathbb{R}^0$ is the [[point]],
*  $\mathbb{R}^1$ is the real line itself,
*  $\mathbb{R}^2$ is the real plane, which may be identified (in two canonical ways) with the [[complex number|complex plane]] $\mathbb{C}$.


Note that a Cartesian space has maximal structure; it comes equipped with a system of coordinates.  Usually we are interested only in some of this structure; what is useful is that the category [[CartSp]] of cartesian spaces and (appropriately) structure-preserving maps is a [[small category]] equivalent to the (usually large) category of *all* finite-dimensional spaces with the structure in question.  This holds at least in the following examples:

*  [[vector space]]s,
*  [[affine space]]s,
*  [[normed vector space]]s,
*  [[inner product space]]s,
*  [[Euclidean space]]s.

$Cart Sp$ can also be understood, for appropriate morphisms, as a category of models for at least the following examples:

*  topological [[manifold]]s,
*  [[smooth space]]s,
*  [[Riemannian manifold]]s.


Sometimes one is interested in allowing $n$ to take other values, in which case one wants a [[product]] in some category that might not be the Cartesian product on underlying sets.

For example, if one is studying Cartesian spaces as inner product spaces, then one might want an $\aleph_0$-dimensional Cartesian space to be the $\aleph_0$-dimensional [[Hilbert space]] $l^2$, which is a proper subset of the cartesian product $\mathbb{R}^{\aleph_0}$.
