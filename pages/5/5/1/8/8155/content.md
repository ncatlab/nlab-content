### On commanding equations to fly
 {#CommandingEquationsToFly}

[[Christopher Fuchs]] recounts (in an email from Dec. 1997, reproduced on [p. 292](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.2390.pdf#page=350) of "*[My Struggles with the Block Universe](Christopher+Fuchs#FuchsSchlosshauerStacey14)"*, 2014):

> a little anecdote about John Wheeler that I heard from [[John Preskill]] a few days ago. In 1972 he had Wheeler for his freshman classical mechanics course at Princeton. 

> One day Wheeler had each student write all the equations of physics s/he knew on a single sheet of paper. He gathered the papers up and placed them all side-by-side on the stage at the front of the classroom. Finally, he looked out at the students and said, 

>> “These pages likely contain all the fundamental equations we know of physics. They encapsulate all that’s known of the world.” 

> Then he looked at the papers and said, 

>> “Now fly!” 

> Nothing happened. He looked out at the audience, then at the papers, raised his hands high, and commanded, 

>> “Fly!” 

> Everyone was silent, thinking this guy had gone off his rocker. Wheeler said, 

>> “You see, these equations can’t fly. But our universe flies. We’re still missing the single, simple ingredient that makes it all fly.”

Wheeler appears (cf. [[Blake Stacey]], [Jan 2016](https://www.sunclipse.org/?m=201601)) saying:

> There’s nothing deader than an equation. You write that down in a square on a tile floor. And on another tile on the floor you write down another equation, which you think might be a better description of the Universe. And you keep on writing down equations hoping to get a better and better equation for what the Universe is and does.

> And then, when you’ve worked your way out to the end of the room and have to step out, you wave your wand and tell the equations to fly.

> And not one of them will put on wings and fly.

> Yet the Universe flies!

> It has a life to it that no equation has, and that life to it is a life with which we are also tied up.
