Wheeler appears saying:


> There’s nothing deader than an equation. You write that down in a square on a tile floor. And on another tile on the floor you write down another equation, which you think might be a better description of the Universe. And you keep on writing down equations hoping to get a better and better equation for what the Universe is and does.

> And then, when you’ve worked your way out to the end of the room and have to step out, you wave your wand and tell the equations to fly.

> And not one of them will put on wings and fly.

> Yet the Universe flies!

> It has a life to it that no equation has, and that life to it is a life with which we are also tied up.
