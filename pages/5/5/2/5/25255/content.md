## Idea

The **Čech descent** condition is used to refer to a specific [[∞-descent]] condition for [[∞-presheaves]].

Concretely, Čech descent can be implemented by performing the [[left Bousfield localization]] of the [[model category]] of [[simplicial presheaves]] equipped with the [[projective model structure]] (say) at [[Čech nerves]] of [[covering families]].
Then [[fibrant objects]] in the resulting [[model structure]] will be precisely [[presheaves]] of [[Kan complexes]] that satisfy the Čech descent condition.

Čech descent should be contrasted with [[hyperdescent]].
The [[hyperdescent]] condition is stronger than the Čech descent condition, since it uses arbitrary [[hypercovers]] instead of [[Čech nerves]] of [[covering families]].
However, for [[hypercomplete sites]] such as [[Zariski site]], [[Nisnevich site]], [[CartSp]], [[Stein site]], and most of the other sites used in differential and complex geometry, the [[hyperdescent]] condition coincides with the Čech descent condition.
