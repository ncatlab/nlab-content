## Idea

The **cellular approximation theorem** states that every [[continuous map]] between [[CW complexes]] (with chosen CW presentations) is [[homotopy|homotopic]] to a [[cellular map]], hence a map that respects the [[cell complex]]-structure, mapping [[n-skeleta]] to $n$-skeleta for all $n$.

This is the analogue for [[CW-complexes]] of the [[simplicial approximation theorem]] (sometimes also called lemma): that every continuous map between the [[geometric realizations]] of [[simplicial complexes]] is [[homotopy|homotopic]] to a map induced by a map of [[simplicial complexes]] (after subdivision). 

## Statement 

+-- {: .num_theorem} 
###### Theorem 

Given a [[continuous map]] $f \colon (X, A) \to (X', A')$ between [[relative CW-complexes]] that is cellular on a subcomplex $(Y, B)$ of $(X, A)$, there is a cellular map $g \colon (X, A) \to (X', A')$ that is homotopic to $f$ relative to $Y$.
