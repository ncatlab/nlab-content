**Cellular approximation theorem**: Every continuous map between the CW complexes is homotopic to a cellular map. 

This is a CW analogue of the simplicial approximation theorem (sometimes also called lemma): every continuous map between the geometric realizations of simplicial sets is homotopic to a map induced by a map of simplicial sets.
