## Idea

In the [[string theory]]-literature "$I_8$" is the standard notation for a certain [[characteristic class]] of [[manifolds]] (of their [[tangent bundles]]): It is a [[rational numbers|rational]] linear combination of the [[cup product|cup square]] of the [[first fractional Pontryagin class]]  with itself, and the [[second Pontryagin class]]:

\[
  \label{TheTerm}
  I_8
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \tfrac{1}{48}
  \Big(
    p_2 \;-\; \big( \tfrac{1}{2} p_1\big)^2
  \Big)
  \;\; 
  \in
  H^8\big( -, \mathbb{Q}\big)
  \,.
\]

In general this is a [[cohomology class]] in [[ordinary cohomology]] with [[rational number|rational]] [[coefficients]], though in applications it appears in further rational combination with other classes that in total yield a class in [[integral cohomology]].

The expression (eq:TheTerm) controls certain [[quantum anomaly cancellation]] in [[M-theory]] and [[type IIA string theory]] ([Vafa-Witten 95](#VafaWitten95), [Duff-Liu-Minasian 95 (3.10) with (3.14)](#DuffLiuMinasian95)). Since it was first obtain as a [[1-loop]]-contribution in [[perturbative quantum gravity|perturbative quantum]] [[supergravity]], it is often known as _the one-loop anomaly term_ or the _one-loop anomaly polynomial_ in [[M-theory]]/[[type IIA string theory]].

## Properties

### Inflow to M5-brane anomalies
 {#InflowToM5BraneAnomaly}

Consider an 11-dimensional [[spin structure|spin]]-[[manifold]] $X^{(11)}$ and a 2-parameter family of 6-dimensional [[submanifolds]] $Q_{M5} \hookrightarrow X^{(11)}$. When regarded as a family of [[worldvolumes]] of an [[M5-brane]], the family of [[normal bundles]] $N_X Q_{M5}$ of this inclusion carries a [[characteristic class]]

\[
  \label{IM5}
  I^{M5}
  \;\coloneqq\;
  I^{M5}_{\psi} 
  + 
  I_{C}
  \;\in\;
  H^8(F \times Q_{M5},\mathbb{Z})
\]

where

1. the first summand is the class of the [[chiral anomaly]] of [[chiral fermions]] on $Q_{M5}$ ([Witten 96, (5.1)](#Witten96)), 

1. the second term the class of the [[quantum anomaly]] of a [[self-dual higher gauge field]] ([Witten 96, (5.4)](#Witten96))

Moreover, there is the restriction of the $I_8$-term (eq:TheTerm) to $Q_{M5}$, hence to the [[tangent bundle]] of $X^{11}$ to $Q_{M5}$ (the "anomaly inflow" from the [[bulk spacetime]] to the M5-brane)

\[
  \label{I8AnomalyInflow}
  I_8\vert_{M5}
  \;\coloneqq\;
   I_8
   \big(
     T_{Q_{M5}} X
   \big)
  \;\in\;
  H^8(F \times Q_{M5},\mathbb{Z})
  \,.
\]

The sum of these cohomology classes, evaluated on the [[fundamental class]] of $Q_{M5}$ is proportional to the [[second Pontryagin class]] of the [[normal bundle]]

\[
  \label{SumOfM5AndInflowAnomalyIsp2}
  I^{M5}
  \;+\;
  I_8\vert_{M5}
  \;=\;
  \tfrac{1}{24} p_2(N_{Q_{M5}})
\]

([Witten 96 (5.7)](#Witten96))

This result used to be "somewhat puzzling" ([Witten 96, p. 35](#Witten96)) since consisteny of the [[M5-brane]] in [[M-theory]] should require its total [[quantum anomaly]] to vanish. But $p_2(N_{Q_{M5}})$ does not in general vanish, and the right conditions to require under which it does vanish were "not clear" ([Witten 96, p. 37](#Witten96)).

(For more details on computations involved this and the following arguments, see also [Bilal-Metzger 03](#BilalMetzger03)).


A resolution was proposed in ([Freed-Harvey-Minasian-Moore 98](#FreedHarveyMinasianMoore98)), further clarified in ([Monnier 13](#Monnier13)), see also ([Bah-Bonetti-Minasian-Nardoni 18](#BahBonettiMinasianNardoni18)). There it is asserted that 

1. the correct bulk anomaly inflow is not just that from $I_8$ itself, but includes also a contribution from the class $G_4$ of the [[supergravity C-field]], as per (eq:FiberIntegration) below ([Monnier 13, around (3.11)](#Monnier13));

1. for $G^{M5}_4$ the "restriction" of the class of the [[supergravity C-field]] to $Q_{M5}$, the term $I^{M5}_{C}$ in (eq:IM5) should have a further summand $-\tfrac{1}{2}\big( G_4^{M5} \big)^2$ ([Monnier 13, around (3.7)](#Monnier13));

1. for 11d spacetime a [[4-sphere]]-[[fiber bundle]], 

   $$
     \array{
        S^4 &\longrightarrow& X^{(11)} 
        \\
        && \big\downarrow^{\mathrlap{\pi}}
        \\
        && X^{(6)}
     }
   $$ 
  
   as befits the [[near horizon geometry]] of a [[black brane|black]] [[M5-brane]], the [[supergravity C-field]] should be taken to be of the form ([Monnier 13, (3.12)](#Monnier13))

   $$
     G_4 =\coloneqq \tfrac{1}{2}\chi + \pi^\ast(G^{M5}_4)
   $$ 
   
   with $\tfrac{1}{2}\chi$ the degree-4 [[Euler class]], whose integral over the 4-sphere fiber is unity ([this Prop.](Sullivan+model+of+a+spherical+fibration#SullivanModelForSphericalFibration)), reflecting the presence of a single M5.

By this proposal, the anomaly inflow from the bulk would not be just $I_8$, as in (eq:I8AnomalyInflow) but would be all of the following [[fiber integration]] 

\[
  \label{FiberIntegration}
  \array{
    \pi_\ast
    \Big(
      -
      \tfrac{1}{6}
      G_4  G_4  G_4
      +
      G_4  I_8
    \Big)
    & =
    - \tfrac{1}{24} p_2 + \tfrac{1}{2}G^{M5}_4 + I_8
  }
\]

Here  we used [this Prop](Spin5#FiberIntegrationOfCupPowersOfChiOver4Sphere) to find that 

$$
  \pi_\ast\big(
    \chi^3
  \big)
  \;=\;
  2 p_2
$$

which would cancel against the first term $\tfrac{1}{24} p_2$ in (eq:FiberIntegration). Hence with this proposal, the remaining M5-brane anomaly (eq:SumOfM5AndInflowAnomalyIsp2) would be canceled.
