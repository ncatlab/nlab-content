## Idea
 {#Idea}

In [[category theory]], the notion of a *[[monad]]* (earlier: "*standard construction*" or "*triple*") is a kind of [[categorification]] of that of a *[[monoid]]*: In their default incarnation, monads are [[endofunctors]] on some [[category]] which are equipped with a [[unitality|unital]] [[associativity|associative]] [[binary operation]] under [[composition]]. More generally, this notion makes sense for [[endomorphism|endo-]] [[1-morphisms]] on any [[object]] in any [[2-category]] beyond [[Cat]]: Monads are [[monoid objects]] [[internalization|internal to]] [[endofunctor|endo]]-[[hom-categories]].

Important examples of monads come from "[[free object|free]] structures". For instance, there is the "free $\mathbb{R}$-vector space" functor $T : \mathbf{Set} \to \mathbf{Set}$. For each set $X$, $TX$ is (the underlying set of) the real vector space generated by $X$. For each function $f : X \to Y$ of sets, $Tf$ is the unique linear function from $TX$ to $TY$ that coincides with $f$ when restricted to the basis $X$ of $TX$. This functor can be endowed with a monad structure by specifying two things: how $X$ occurs in $TX$ as a generating set (hence a function $\eta_X : X \to TX$), and how to perform algebraic manipulations such as $r(x + s(y+tz)) = rx + rsy + rst z$ (hence a function $\mu_X : TTX \to TX$). Note that, without these specifications, $TX$ is just a set---its algebraic structure is encoded by $\eta_X$ and $\mu_X$. A similar idea applies to the concepts of free modules, free groups, free monoids, and many others.

Together with the [[adjunctions]] ([[adjoint functors]]) that they correspond to (see [below](#RelationBetweenAdjunctionsAndMonads)), monads are among the most pervasive structures in [[category theory]] (where they form the basis of [[categorical algebra|categorical]] and [[universal algebra]], whence one speaks of *[[algebras over a monad]]*) and in [[mathematics]] more generally (certainly in fields like [[algebraic topology]], [[sheaf and topos theory]] and [[homological algebra]], where the notion originates in the guise of "[[canonical resolutions]]").

Last but not least, monads play a central role in [[formal logic]] (cf. [[modal logic]] and [[modal type theory]]) and in [[computer science]], where they are understood (cf. the "[[computational trilogy]]") as encoding "notions of computation" with "computational effects" in the framework of [[functional programming]]: see at *[[monad (computer science)|monads in computer science]]*.


## Etymology
 {#Etymology}

The term "monad" was introduced in [Bénabou 1967, Def. 5.4.1](#Bénabou67), where, after observing (Exp. 5.4.1) that monads in 1-object 2-categories ([deloopings of](delooping#DeloopingOfHigherCategoricalStructures) [[monoidal categories]]) are *[[monoids]]*:

        "bottom": 20,
        "right": 0, 
        "left": 10
    }
\end{imagefromfile}

{#BenabouFootnote} it says in a footnote:

\begin{imagefromfile}
    "file_name": "Benabou-FootnoteOnMonadTerminology.jpg",
    "width": 700,
    "unit": "px",
    "margin": {
        "top": -20,
        "bottom": 20,
        "right": 0, 
        "left": 10
    },
    "caption": "(from [Bénabou 1967, p. 40](#Bénabou67))"
\end{imagefromfile}

Beyond this footnote, the only contemporary account that seems to exist of the terminological genesis, [Barr 2009](#Barr09), recalls the following exchange, on the backdrop of a widely felt dissatisfaction with the earlier terminology of "standard construction" and "triple":

> In the summer (or maybe late spring, the Oberwohlfach records will show this) of 1966, there was a category meeting there. &lbrack;...&rbrack; One day at lunch or dinner I happened to be sitting next to Jean Bénabou and he turned to me and said something like "How about `monad'?" I thought about and said it sounded pretty good to me. So Jean proposed it to the general audience and there was general agreement. It suggested "monoid" of course and it is a monoid in a functor category.

{#MonadTerminologyFurtherDiscussion} Further discussion on the issue in 2023 has recollections by [[Jirí Adámek]] of recollections by [[Bill Lawvere]] to the extent that:

> it was in the common room of the old castle at Oberwolfach when Sammy &lbrack;[[Samuel Eilenberg]]&rbrack; came out from behind the piano and announced the change.

But [[Michael Barr]] clarifies that:

> I am more than willing to believe that it was Bénabou sitting next to me who proposed monad. It is entirely possible that Sammy came down and pronounced it "official". And it was certainly in the old castle.

Interestingly Bénabou's footnote [above](#BenabouFootnote) gives a second motivation for "monad":

\begin{imagefromfile}
    "file_name": "Benabou-MonadDefinition.jpg",
    "float": "right",
    "width": 650,
    "unit": "px",
    "margin": {
        "top": -20,
        "bottom": 20,
        "right": 0, 
        "left": 10
    },
    "caption": "(from [Bénabou 1967, p. 39](#Bénabou67))"
\end{imagefromfile}


{#ItIsStriking} It is striking that [Bénabou 1967, Def. 5.4.1](#Bénabou67) *defines* a monad to be a [[lax 2-functor]] from the [[terminal category]] $1$ to the [[Cat|2-category of categories]] (and more generally to whatever given ambient [[2-category]] "$\underline{S}$") and then proceeds to unwind the equivalence of this definition to the traditional one:
$$
  Monads(\underline{S})
  \;\;\;
   \simeq
  \;\;\;
  \Big\{
    1 \xrightarrow{\; lax \;} \underline{S}
  \Big\}
  \,.
$$
In this sense, monads are *[[global element|point-like elements]]* in a [[2-category theory|2-category theoretic]] sense (say in the [[2-topos]] [[Cat]]), which squares well with [Euclid's ancient notion of monads](monad+terminology#HistoricalOrigins) as indivisible building blocks. In fact, as discussed there, "monad" (both in ancient and still in modern Greek) just means "unit" in the sense of the unit [[natural number]] $1$, and [Bénabou 1967, Def. 5.4.1](#Bénabou67) literally identifies monads with the (lax) units $1 \to \underline{S}$ in the ambient 2-category.

In generalization of this situation, one may consider lax functors out of [[codiscrete groupoids]] $CoDisc(1^{\sqcup_n})$ on $n$ objects, which [Bénabou 1967, Def. 5.5](#Bénabou67) calls *polyads*:
$$
  Polyads(\underline{S})
  \;\;\;
   \simeq
  \;\;\;
  \Big\{
    CoDisc(1^{\sqcup_n}) 
     \xrightarrow{\; lax \;} 
  \underline{S}
  \Big\}
  \,.
$$


On the other hand (as maybe alluded to in the first line of [Barr 2009](#Barr09)), just a few years earlier, the ancient [[monad terminology]] had already been adopted in [[nonstandard analysis]] as the term for *[[infinitesimal neighbourhoods]]* ([Robinson 1966, p. 57](infinitesimal+neighborhood#Robinson66) and [Luxembourg 1966](#infinitesimal+neighborhood#Luxemburg66), compare also [Keisler 1976, Def. 1.2](infinitesimal+neighborhood#Keisler76), [Kutateladze 2011](infinitesimal+neighborhood#Kutateladze11) and, speaking [[synthetic differential geometry|synthetically]]: [Kock 1980](infinitesimal+neighborhood#Kock80)).

It so happens that --- in the [[topos theory|topos theoretic]] formulation of [[infinitesimals]] via [[differential cohesion]] --- the construction of [[infinitesimal neighbourhoods]] *is* (see [here](infinitesimal+disk+bundle#MonadicityAdjointToJetBundles)) a monad in the sense of [[category theory]]! -- namely the [[left adjoint|left]] [[adjoint monad]] to the [[jet comonad]] ([Khavkine & Schreiber 2017, p. 23](infinitesimal+disk+bundle#KhavkineSchreiber17)).



## Definition

### Monads

A **monad** in a [[bicategory]] $K$ is given by

1. an [[object]] $a$ in $K$,

1. an [[endomorphism]] $t \colon a \to a$ in $K$,

1. a [[2-morphism]] $\;\eta \colon 1_a \to t$ in $K$

   (the *[[unit of a monad|unit]]* or *return* operation), and

1. a [[2-morphism]] $\mu \colon t \circ t \to t$ 

   (the *multiplication* or *join* operation)

such that the diagrams

\end{tikzcd}](https://q.uiver.app/#q=WzAsNCxbMCwwLCJ0dHQiXSxbMSwwLCJ0dCJdLFswLDEsInR0Il0sWzEsMSwidCJdLFsxLDMsIlxcbXUiXSxbMiwzLCJcXG11IiwyXSxbMCwyLCJcXG11IHQiLDJdLFswLDEsInRcXG11Il1d)
commute (where certain [[coherence]] [[isomorphism]]s have been omitted).

The name "monad" and the terms "unit", "multiplication" and "associativity" bear a clear analogy with [[monoids]] (but see also at _[[monad (disambiguation)]]_).  Indeed, one can define a monad on an object $a$ of a [[bicategory]] $K$ as just a [[monoid object]] in the endomorphism category $K(a,a)$. Alternatively, monads can be taken as more fundamental, and a [[monoid in a monoidal category]] $C$ can be defined as a monad in $\mathbf{B} C$, the one-object bicategory corresponding to $C$.

A third and somewhat less obvious definition says that a monad in $K$ is a **[[lax 2-functor]]** from the terminal bicategory $1$ to $K$: the unique object $\ast$ of $1$ is sent to the object $a$, the morphism $1_a$ becomes $t$, and $\eta$ and $\mu$ arise from the coherent 2-cells expressing lax functoriality. This, in turn, is equivalent to saying that a monad is a [[category enriched in a bicategory]] with a single object and single morphism. Among higher-category theorists, it is tempting to suggest that this is the most fundamental definition, and the most basic reason for the ubiquity and importance of monads.  Regardless of this, the earlier more elementary definitions are both practically and pedagogically essential.

Finally, a monad can be defined in terms of the "Kleisli operation" taking any map $a \to T b$ to a map $T a \to T b$. For instance, if $T : \mathbf{Set} \to \mathbf{Set}$ is the "free $\mathbb{R}$-vector space" functor, then a function $f : X \to TY$ is equivalent to a linear function from $TX$ to $TY$. Indeed, the function $f$ specifies how to map the basis vectors of $TX$ into $TY$, and $f$ has a unique extension to a linear function on $TX$. (And conversely, every linear function from $TX$ to $TY$ specifies a unique function from $X$ to $TY$ by restricting to the basis.) See [[extension system]] for more details.

We can picture a monad in $K$ as an image of the [[oriental|third oriental]] in $K$. See the remarks at [[monoidal category]].

The data of and axioms for a monad can be expressed graphically with [[string diagrams]]. Writing $T \colon C \to C, \eta, \mu$ for the monad in question (this notation being the standard one when $K = Cat$), these data can be represented as

[[monad-data-labeled.png:pic]]

Thanks to the distinctive shapes, one can usually omit the labels:

[[monad-data-unlabeled.png:pic]]

The axioms then appear as:

[[monad-axioms-unlabeled.png:pic]]



### The 2-category of monads
 {#BicategoryOfMonads}

Given the equivalence between monads in a [[2-category]] $K$ and [[lax functors]] $1 \to K$ &lbrack;[Bénabou 1967, pp. 39](#Bénabou67)&rbrack; it is straightforward to define the [[2-category]] $Mnd(K)$ of monads in $K$ to be the [[lax functor|lax]] [[functor category]] $[1,K]_\ell$, which consists of [[lax functors]], [[lax transformations]] and their[[modifications]].

Spelling this out &lbrack;[Maranda 1966](#Maranda66), [Maranda 1968](#Maranda68), [Frei 1969 p. 269](#Frei69), [Pumplün 1970 p 330 & 334](#Pumplün70), [Coppey 1970](#Coppey70), [Street 1972 p. 150-151](#Street72), review in [Leinster 2004 pp. 148](#Leinster04)&rbrack;:

\begin{definition}\label{TwoCategoryOfMonads}
**(2-category of monads)**
\linebreak
Let $K$ be a [[2-category]].

1. An [[object]] in $Mnd(K)$ is a monad $(a,t,\eta,\mu)$ in $K$;

1. a [[1-morphism]] $(a,t) \to (b,s)$ in $Mnd(K)$ ("monad functor" or "[[monad transformation]]")

   is given by 

   1. a [[1-morphism]] $x \colon a \to b$ in $K$, and 

   1. a [[2-morphism]] $\lambda \colon s x \to x t$  in $K$
 
   making the following [[commuting diagram|diagrams commute]]:

   $$
   \array{
     x & \stackrel{\eta^s x}{\to} & s x 
     \\
     \mathllap{x \eta^t}

      \\
      s x 
      & & 
      \overset{\lambda}{\longrightarrow} 
      & & 
      x t
   }
   $$


1. a [[2-morphism]] $(x,\lambda) \Rightarrow (y, \kappa)$ in $Mnd(K)$ is given by 

   * a [[2-morphism]] $m \colon x \Rightarrow y$  in $K$

   making the following [[commuting diagram|diagram commute]]

   $$
   \array{
    s x & \stackrel{s m}{\to} & s y \\
    \mathllap{\lambda} \downarrow & & \downarrow    \mathrlap{\kappa} \\
    x t & \stackrel{m t}{\to} & y t
   }
   $$

\end{definition}

\begin{remark}\label{HandednessOfMonadMorphism}
**(handedness of the underlying natural transformation)**
\linebreak
Beware that $\lambda$ in Def. \ref{TwoCategoryOfMonads} is oriented oppositely to what one might expect. This need not be so but is a possible choice, see [Pumplün 1970 p 334](#Pumplün70), [Street 1972 pp 158](#Street72).

One issue is that the functor between [[Kleisli categories]] induced by a monad morphism goes in the direction *opposite* of $\lambda$ as defined above (as generally for [[extension of scalars]] of [[module objects]] along a [[homomorphism]] of [[monoids]]), so that for authors who adopt the opposite of the above convention (such as [Frei 1969 p. 269](#Frei69), [Pumplün 1970 p 330](#Pumplün70), [Barr & Wells 1985 §6.1](#BarrWells85) and in our Exp. \ref{TransformationOfMonadsOnFixedCategory} below) the association of monad morphisms to functors between Kleisli catgeories is contravariant (eg. [Frei 1969, Thm. 2](#Frei69), [Barr & Wells 1985 Thm. 6.3](#BarrWells85)).
\end{remark}


\begin{example}\label{TransformationOfMonadsOnFixedCategory}
**(transformation of monads on a fixed category)**
\linebreak
This example is the simpler but important special case of the general Def. \ref{TwoCategoryOfMonads} where the monads all act on the same fixed object -- in particular the same category if $K = Cat$ (stated in this form for instance in [Barr & Wells 1985 §6.1](#BarrWells85)),  of relevance notably for [[monads in computer science]] (where this is [Moggi 1989 Def. 4.0.11](monad+in+computer+science#Moggi89Abstract)) which typically all act on the same category of [[data types|data]] [[types]]:


For a pair of monads
$(\mathcal{E}, ret^{\mathcal{E}}, join^{\mathcal{E}})$,
$(\mathcal{E}', ret^{\mathcal{E}'}, join^{\mathcal{E}'})$
on a fixed category $\mathbf{C}$:

$$
  \mathcal{E}, \mathcal{E}'
  \;\colon\;
  \mathbf{C} \longrightarrow \mathbf{C}
  \,,
$$

a morphism between them is 

* a [[natural transformation]] $trans^{\mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{E}'} \,\colon\, \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{E}'$ between the [[underlying]] [[functors]]

such that it respects, in the evident way, the [[monad units]]

in that it makes these [[commuting square|squares commute]].

\begin{remark} 
\label{ExtensionOfModalesAlongMonadTransformation} 
A monad transformation as in Exp. \ref{TransformationOfMonadsOnFixedCategory}
[[contravariant functor|contravariantly]] induces a [[functor]] of [[Eilenberg-Moore categories]] of [[module over a monad|modales]] by [[extension of scalars]] &lbrack;[Frei 1969, Thm. 2](#Frei69), [Barr & Wells 1985 thm. 6.3](#BarrWells85)&rbrack;:

\begin{imagefromfile}

    }
\end{imagefromfile}

Since this [[extension of scalars]] is the identity on [[underlying]] [[objects]], it cannot in general restrict to a functor on [[Kleisli categories]]. 

{#ExtensionOfFreeModalesAlsoIsomorphicMonadTransformation} However, when the [[monad transformation]] $tr \,\colon\, \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{E}'$ is an [[isomorphism]] then $tr^\ast$ does take [free modales](algebra+over+a+monad#FreeAlgebras) to free modales up to [[isomorphism]]. This is seen from the following diagram:

$$
  \array{
    \mathcal{E}
    \mathcal{E}(D)
    &
    \overset{
      \mathcal{E}(tr_D)
    }{\longrightarrow}
    &
    \mathcal{E}
    \mathcal{E}'(D)
    &
    \overset{
      trans
        ^{\mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{E}'}
        _{\mathcal{E}'(D)}
    }{\longrightarrow}
    &
    \mathcal{E}' 
    \mathcal{E}'(D)
    \\
    \Big\downarrow\mathrlap{ {}^{ 
      join^{\mathcal{E}}_D 
    } } 
    &&
    \Big\downarrow\mathrlap{ {}^{  
      trans^\ast 
      join^{\mathcal{E}'}_D
    } } 
    &&
    \Big\downarrow\mathrlap{ {}^{ join^{\mathcal{E}'}_D } }
    \\
    \mathcal{E}(D)
    &
    \underset{
      \;\; 
      trans^{\mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{E}'}_D 
      \;\;
    }{\longrightarrow}
    &
    \mathcal{E}'(D)
    &=&
    \mathcal{E}'(D)
  }
$$

Here the middle vertical morphism is the nominal image under extension of the free modale on the right along $trans^{\mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{E}'}$, but the square on the left, which commutes by assumption on $trans^{\mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{E}'}$, exhibits an isomorphism from the middle modale to the $\mathcal{E}$-free modale on the left.
\end{remark}


\begin{remark}\label{MonadTransformers}
**(monad transfomers)**
\linebreak
  When monads are used to model [[computational effects]] in [[functional programming]], a common concern is to *combine* different effects, such that previous effects are subsumed among the newly combined effects. This is formalized by "[[monad transformers]]" which are systems of morphisms of monads as in Exp. \ref{TransformationOfMonadsOnFixedCategory}, forming a [[pointed endofunctor]] on the category $Mnd$ of all monads.
\end{remark}


\begin{example}\label{IdentityMonadIsInitial}
  The [[initial object]] in the category of monads on a fixed category $\mathbf{C}$ (Exp. \ref{TransformationOfMonadsOnFixedCategory}) is the identity monad.
\end{example}
\begin{proof}
  We need to show that for every monad $\mathcal{E}$ on $\mathbf{C}$ there is a natural transformation $trans^{Id \to \mathcal{E}} \,\colon\,  Id \to \mathcal{E}$ which makes, first of all, this square commute:

### Algebras/modules over a monad 
 {#Algebras}

Given that a monad in a bicategory $\mathcal{B}$ is nothing but a [[monoid object]] in a hom-category $\mathcal{B}(a,a)$, it is natural to consider a [[module]] over this monoid: a [[module for a monad]].  This notion of module is more general than a module in a [[monoidal category]], however, since it need not live in $\mathcal{B}(a,a)$ but can be in $\mathcal{B}(b,a)$ (for left modules) or $\mathcal{B}(a,c)$ (for right modules).

In a [[Cat]]-like [[bicategory]], left modules over a monad are usually known as _[[algebras over a monad|algebras over the monad]]_.  This terminology is confusing from the point of view of monads as monoids, but is justified because in [[Cat]] itself, such algebras with domain [[terminal category|1]] are just algebras for a monad in the classical sense.  Such algebras are a powerful tool to encode general algebraic structures; this is the topic of [[universal algebra]].  The algebras over a monad form its [[Eilenberg-Moore category]], which is characterized by a [[universal property]].

Some monads arise from [[operad]]s, in which case algebras for the monad are the same as algebras for the operad.  A [[Lawvere theory]] is another special sort of monad in $Cat$.

## Properties


[[!include relation between adjunctions and monads -- section]]




## Examples 

### Monads on $Set$

Many of these monads also have standard usages as [[monad (computer science)|monads in computer science]].

+-- {: .num_example #MaybeMonad}
###### Example
The free-forgetful [[adjunction]] between [[pointed sets]] and [[sets]] induces an [[endofunctor]] $(-)_* : Set \to Set$ which adds a new disjoint point. This is called the [[maybe monad]] in computer science.
=--

+-- {: .num_example #ListMonad}
###### Example
The free-forgetful [[adjunction]] between [[monoids]] and [[sets]] induces an [[endofunctor]] $T : Set \to Set$ defined by 

$$TA := \bigsqcup_{n \ge 0} A^n $$ 

giving the **free monoid monad**. This also goes by the name [[list monad]] or [[Kleene-Star]] in computer science. The components of the unit $\eta_A : A \to T A$ give inclusions sending each element of $A$ to the corresponding singleton list. The components of the multiplication $\mu_A : T^2 A \to T A$ are the concatenation functions, sending a list of lists to the corresponding list (Known as flattening in computer science). This monad can be defined in any [[monoidal category]] with [[coproducts]] that distribute over the monoidal product.  
=--

+-- {: .num_example #StateMonad}
###### Example
For a fixed set of "states" $S$, the ($S \times - \dashv (-)^S$)-adjunction induces a monad $(S \times -)^S$ on $Set$ called the [[state monad]]. This is a commonly used monad in computer science. In functional programming languages such as Haskell, states can be used to model "side effects" of computations.
=--

+-- {: .num_example #ContinuationMonad}
###### Example

The contravariant [[power set]]-functor is its own [[right adjoint]], giving $\Set(A,P B) \cong \Set (B, P A)$. Note that $\hom(A, P B) = \hom(A, \hom(B,\Omega)) \cong \hom( A \times B, \Omega) = P(A \times B)$ inducing a **double power set monad** taking a set $A$ to $P^2 A$. The components of the [[unit of a monad|unit]] are the [[ultrafilter|principal ultrafilter]] functions $\eta_A \colon A \to P^2 A$ which send an element $a$ to the set of subsets of $A$ that contain $a$. The components of the multiplication $\mu_A$ is the [[inverse image]] function for the map $\eta_{P A} \colon P A \to P^3 A$; which can be painfully stated as: the function taking a set of sets of sets of subsets to the set of subsets of $A$ with the property that one of the sets of sets of subsets is the set of all sets of subsets of $A$ that include that particular subset as an element. 

Replacing the two element [[power object]] $\Omega$ with any other set gives similar monads. In [[monad in computer science|computer science contexts]] these are known as *[[continuation monad|continuation monads]]*. This construction can also be generalised for any other [[closed monoidal category|bi-closed monoidal category]]. For example there is a similar **double dual monad** on [[Vect|$\Vect_k$]].

### Algebra


+-- {: .num_example #FreeRModMonad}
###### Example
The free-forgetful [[adjunction]] between [[sets]] and the category of $R$-[[modules]]. This induces the **free $R$-module monad** $R[-] : Set \to Set$. The **free abelian group monad** and **free vector space monad** are special cases.
=--

+-- {: .num_example #FreeGroupMonad}
###### Example
The free-forgetful [[adjunction]] between [[sets]] and the category of [[groups]] gives the **free group monad** $F : Set \to Set$ that sends $A$ to the set $F(A)$ of finite words in the letters $a \in A$ together with inverses $a^{-1}$.  
=--


### Topology

+-- {: .num_example #UltrafilterMonad}
###### Example
There is a [[forgetful functor]] $U : \Top \to \Set$ taking a [[topological space]] to its underlying [[set]]. It is right adjoint to the discrete space functor $D: \Set \to \Top$ taking a set to its [[discrete topology]]. There is also an adjoint pair $\beta \dashv U'$ between the category of [[compact]] [[Hausdorff topological spaces]] and the category of [[topological spaces]], where $\beta$ is the [[Stone-Cech compactification]]. The composites of these two adjoint pairs gives a monad $\beta : \Set \to \Set$ sending a set to its underlying set of the Stone-Cech compactification of its discrete space. It is also known as the [[ultrafilter]] monad as $\beta$ can be thought of as the functor taking a set to its set of ultrafilters.

=--

### Monads in Cat

Monads are often considered in the 2-category [[Cat]] where they are given by [[endofunctors]] with a monoid structure on them.  In particular, monads _in_ [[Cat]] _on_ [[Set]] are equivalent to the equational theories studied in universal algebra.  In this context, a monad abstracts the concept of an [[algebraic theory]] (such as "group" or "ring"), giving a general notion of [[extra structure]] on an object of a category.

Classically, if $\mathbf{T}$ is an algebraic theory (e.g. the theory of groups), a $\mathbf{T}$-structure on a set tells us how to interpret various _terms_ (e.g. $(a\cdot c)$) formed from elements of the set, subject to certain _axioms_ (e.g. $(a\cdot (b\cdot c))=((a\cdot b)\cdot c)$).  A monad collects this up into a functor $T$.  For a set $X$, $T X$ is the set of all terms of the theory formed from elements of $X$, with terms identified if axioms force them to be equal.  For groups, $T X$ is thus the (underlying set of the) [[free group]] of formal words $a \cdot b \cdot \cdots \cdot s$ from $X$; the fact that $T$ gives [[free object|free]] structures turns out to be [[monadic adjunction|typical]].

To capture the theory fully, we need to include a little more data: a natural map $\eta_X : X \to T X$ recording how each $a \in X$ gives a trivial term $a$, and a map $\mu_X:T T X \to T X$ recording how further terms built from terms are already present as terms in $T X$.  

Given a monad in [[Cat]] on a category $C$, one can always produce a [[canonical resolution]] of any object of $C$. 

### Other examples

* Monads on [[partial order|posets]] are particularly simple (in particular, they are always [[idempotent monad|idempotent]]).  In fact, monads on [[power set]]s are extremely common throughout mathematics; they are known in less categorially-inclined circles as [[Moore closure]]s, and there are many examples there.

* An [[internalization|internal]] monad on the [[subobject classifier]] of a [[topos]] $E$ is a [[Lawvere-Tierney topology]] on $E$.

* If $C$ is a category with [[finite limits]], then a monad in the bicategory of [[spans]] in $C$ is the same thing as an [[internal category]] in $C$.

* A monad in the bicategory [[Prof]] of [[profunctors]] on a category $A$ can be identified with an identity-on-objects functor $A\to B$.

There is a [[vertical categorification]] of monads  to [[(∞,1)-category|(∞,1)-categories]]. See [[(infinity,1)-monad|(∞,1)-monad]].
