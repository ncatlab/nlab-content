A necklace in a quiver is a closed oriented path in the quiver up to cyclic permutation of the arrows making up the cycle. 
The space of necklaces in the path algebra of a quiver has a natural Lie algebra structure, which is a noncommutative analogue of a Poisson bracket on the sympletic reduction. In the case of one vertex and n loops the path algebra is the free associative algebra on n generators. In that case the necklace Lie algebra is introduced
