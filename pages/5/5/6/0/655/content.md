A _2-crossed module_ is a normal complex   of  groups

$$L\stackrel{\partial_2}{\to} M \stackrel{\partial_1}{\to}N,$$ 

together with an action of $N$ on all three groups and a   mapping 

$$\{ - ,- \} : M\times M \to L$$

such that 

1.  the action of $N$ on itself is by conjugation, and $\partial_2$ and $\partial_1$ are $N$-equivariant;

1.  for all $m_0,m_1 \in M$,

$$\partial_2\{m_0,m_1\} = \,^{\partial_1 m_0}m_1 . m_0m_1^{-1}m_0^{-1};$$

1.  if $\ell_0,\ell_0 \in L$, then
$$\{\partial_2\ell_0,\partial_2\ell\} = [\ell_1,\ell_0];$$

1.  if $\ell \in L$ and $m\in M$, then

$$\{m,\partial \ell\}\{\partial \ell,m\} = \,^{\partial m}\ell.\ell^{-1};$$

1.  for all $m_0,m_1,m_2 \in M$,
    
* $\{m_0,m_1m_2\} = \{m_0,m_1\}\{ \partial \{m_0,m_2\},(m_0m_1m_0^{-1})\}\{m_0,m_2\}$;

* $\{m_0m_1,m_2\} = \,^{\partial m_0}\{m_1,m_2\}\{m_0,m_1m_2m_1^{-1}\}$;

1. if $n\in N$ and $m_0,m_1 \in M$, then 

$$^n{m_0,m_1\} = { \,^nm_0, \,^nm_1}.$$


The pairing $\{ - ,- \} : M\times M \to L$ is often called the _Peiffer lifting_  of the 2-crossed module.
