## Pregroups

As defined in [Lambek 1999](#Lambek99), [Lambek 2008](#Lambek08), a **pregroup** is a [[partial order|partially-ordered]] [[monoid]] $(P, \leq, \cdot, 1)$ such that every object $t \in P$ has [[category with duals|left- and right-adjoints]] $t^l, t^r \in P$.
Explicitly we have the following four axioms:

* $t^l  t \leq 1, \quad t t^r \leq 1 \quad$ (contraction)
* $1 \leq t t^l, \quad 1 \leq t^r t \quad$ (expansion)

In other words, a pregroup is a [[rigid monoidal category]] which is [[thin category|thin]] and [[skeletal category|skeletal]].
Note that a commutative pregroup is simply a [[group]].
Here are a few variants of pregroups that appear in the literature, see [Coecke 2013](#Coecke13):

* If we drop the anti-symmetry axiom for posets, we get a **quasi-pregroup**,
* If we drop the two expansion axioms, we get a **protogroup**.

### Free pregroups and the switching lemma

In [[linguistics|linguistic]] applications, one starts with a [[partial order|poset]] $B = \{ s, n, \dots \}$ of **basic types** (e.g. sentence and noun) and then takes the free pregroup $P_B$ generated by $B$.
For a basic type $b \in B$, iterated adjoints $\dots, b^{ll}, b^l, b, b^r, b^{rr}, \dots \in P_B$ are called **simple types**; an arbitrary type $t \in P_B$ may then be given as a sequence of simple types.
The following lemma makes the parsing problem for free pregroups decidable --- i.e. given a sentence type $s \in P_B$ and the types for a sequence of words $t_1, \dots, t_n \in P_B$, is $t_1 \dots  t_n \leq s$?

**Switching lemma ([Lambek 1999](#Lambek99)):** For any pair of types $t, t' \in P_B$, if $t \leq t'$ then there is a type $t'' \in P_B$ such that $t \leq t''$ without expansions and $t'' \leq t'$ without contractions, i.e. free protogroups recognise the same language as free pregroups.


### From pregroups to compact 2-categories

In [Preller, Lambek 2007](#PrellerLambek07), Preller and Lambek generalise the free pregroup construction above to free compact 2-categories in order to capture [[proof relevance]].
This allows to distinguish between the distinct parsings of ambiguous phrases such as
"(men and women) who like maths" vs. "men and (women who like maths)".

Note that the compact 2-categories of Lambek and Preller differ from [[compact closed 2-category]] in that they are not required to be symmetric.
A non-symmetric compact closed 2-category with one object is simply a [[rigid monoidal category]].

Given a poset of basic types $B$, the objects of the free rigid monoidal category $C_B$ are the same as that of the free (quasi-)pregroup, the arrows may be described as planar [[string diagram|string diagrams]]. Given two types $t, t' \in P_B$, we have that $t \leq t'$ if and only if there is an arrow $r : t \to t'$ in $C_B$.

## Pregroup grammars as free rigid monoidal categories {#PregroupGrammar}

A **pregroup grammar** is a tuple $G = (B, \Sigma, \Delta, s)$ where $B$ and $\Sigma$ are finite sets called the _basic types_ and the _vocabulary_ respectively, $\Delta \subseteq \Sigma \times P_B$ is a relation called the _dictionnary_ and $s \in P_B$ is a designated _sentence type_.
We require that $\Delta$ is finite, i.e. the set of possible types $\Delta(w) \subseteq P_B$ is finite for each word $w \in \Sigma$.
The _language_ of $G$ is then given by:

$$L(G) = \big\{ w_1 \dots w_n \in \Sigma^n \vert n \in \mathbb{N}, \quad \exists t \in \prod_{i \leq n} \Delta(w_i) \quad t \leq s \big\}$$

i.e. a sequence of words $w_1 \dots w_n \in \Sigma^n$ is said to be grammatical whenever there is a dictionnary entry $(w_i, t_i) \in \Delta$ for each word $w_i$ such that $t_1 \dots t_n \leq s$.
One may simplify this by redefining $L(G) = \big\{ w_1 \dots w_n \in \Sigma^n \vert C_G(w_1 \dots w_n, s) \neq \emptyset \big\}$ where $C_G$ is the free [[rigid monoidal category]] with:

* generating objects the [[disjoint union]] $B + \Sigma$,
* generating arrows the dictionnary entries $(w, t) \in \Delta$ with $dom(w, t) = w$ and $cod(w, t) = t$.

That is, a sequence of words is grammatical whenever there exists a string diagram going from the sequence of words to the sentence type.
Note that traditionally the identity wires for words $w \in \Sigma$ are omitted, hence dictionnary entries are depicted as triangles with no input.
Contractions are depicted as cups, e.g. from $(Alice, n), (loves, n^r s n^l), (Bob, n) \in \Delta$ and $n n^r s n^l n \leq s$ we get the following diagram:

**Theorem ([Buszkowski, Moroz 2008](#BuszkowskiMoroz08)):** For each pregroup grammar $G$, there is a [[context-free grammar]] $G'$ such that $L(G) = L(G')$. Furthermore, $G'$ may be computed in time polynomial in the size of $G$.

The opposite direction also holds, hence pregroup grammar and [[context-free grammar]] are said to be **weakly equivalent**: the translation preserves only the generated languages, it does not preserve the structure of syntax trees. 

## Pregroup semantics as strong monoidal functors

One may give a [[semantics]] to a pregroup grammar $G = (B, \Sigma, \Delta, s)$ by defining a strong [[monoidal functor]] $F : C_G \to S$, where $C_G$ is the free [[rigid monoidal category]] described in [section 2](#PregroupGrammar). $S$ is a suitable [[rigid monoidal category]], e.g. $\text{FdVect}$ or $\text{Rel}$, depending on the application.
Note the similarity with a [[Lawvere theory]] as a monoidal functor from a syntactic category to $\text{Set}$.

We require the image for all words $w \in \Sigma$ to be the monoidal unit $F(w) = I$, hence the image for each dictionnary entry $(w, t) \in \Delta$ is given by a state $F(w, t) : I \to F(t)$.
The meaning $F(r) : I \to F(s)$ for a sentence $w_1 \dots w_n \in \Sigma^n$ with grammatical reduction $r : w_1 \dots w_n \to s$ may then be computed from the individual meanings $F(w_i, t_i) : I \to F(t_i)$ of the words, following [[Gottlob Frege|Frege's]] principle of [[compositionality]].
This has been developed in [Preller 2005](#Preller05) as well as in a series of papers by [[Bob Coecke]] and others, see [[categorical compositional distributional semantics]].
