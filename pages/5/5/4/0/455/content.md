A Boolean algebra is an algebraic structure which models classical [[propositional calculus]], roughly the fragment of the logical calculus which deals with the basic logical connectives "and", "or", "implies", and "not". 

## Definition 

There are many known ways of defining a Boolean algebra. Here are just a few: 

* A Boolean algebra is a complemented distributive lattice. 

* A Boolean algebra is a [[Heyting algebra]] $H$ satisfying the law of excluded middle, which means either 
$$\neg \neg = 1: H \to H$$ 
or (equivalently) 
$$\forall_{x \in H} x \vee \neg x = 1$$

* A Boolean algebra is a lattice $L$ equipped with a function $\neg: L \to L$ satisfying 
$$a \wedge b \leq c \qquad iff \qquad a \leq \neg b \vee c$$
