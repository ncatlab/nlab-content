For a [[category]] $C$ and [[endofunctor]] $F$, an __algebra__ of $F$ is an object $X$ in $C$ and a map $\alpha: F(X) \to X$.

The dual concept is a [[coalgebra for an endofunctor]].

If the endofunctor has the structure of a monad, then a [[module over a monad|modules over the monad]] have in particular the structure of an algebra over its underlying endofunctor. 

See also [[initial algebra]].
