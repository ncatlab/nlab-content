## Idea

In [[thermodynamics]], the *Boltzmann distribution* is the [[probability distribution]] on the space of configurations of a [[physical system]] which [[maximum|maximizes]] the [[entropy]] subject to the constraint that the [[expectation value]] of the [[energy]] is fixed.

It is characterized by a [[probability density]] proportional to the [[exponential]] of the [[energy]] weighted my minus the [[inverse temperature]]:

$$
  d p 
    \;\propto\; 
  e^{ - \frac{E}{k T} } \, d E
  \,,
$$

where $k$ is [[Boltzmann's constant]] (a [[physical unit]]).
