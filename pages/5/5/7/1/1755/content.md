#Idea#

See [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] for background, idea and introduction.

The [[local model structure on simplicial presheaves]] has a slight variant with [[presheaf|presheaves]] replaced by [[sheaf|sheaves]].

This is originally due to Joyal. Later Jardine introduced the [[local model structure on simplicial presheaves]] and proved that both are [[Quillen equivalence|Quillen equivalent]].

#Definition#

For $C$ a [[site]] and $SSh(C)$ the category of [[sheaf|sheaves]] on $X$ with values in [[simplicial set]]s, Joyal's **local model structure** on $SSh(X)$ is (from a revisionist point of view) the restriction of the _injective_ [[local model structure on simplicial presheaves]] from all presheaves to sheaves.
