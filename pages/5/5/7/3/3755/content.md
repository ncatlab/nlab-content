Take a __[[diagram]]__ $D$ in a [[category]] $C$ to be a [[directed graph]] $J$ and a [[functor]] to $C$ from the [[free category]] on $J$.  Then $D$ __commutes__ if, for every pair $x,y$ of vertices in $J$ and every pair $f,g$ of paths from $x$ to $y$ in $J$, then $D(f) = D(g)$ in $C$.

It should be possible to spell this all out in an elementary way, in particular without referring to functors (in case you want to define functors using commutative diagrams).


This is just a stub for now, but I hope we can come up with a nice [[nPOV]] description.
