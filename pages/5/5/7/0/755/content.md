_&#192; la poursuite des [[stack|champs]]_ (literally _In Pursuit of Stacks_, also _Pursuing Stacks_) is a manuscript written by [[Alexander Grothendieck]] in 1983. 

Its influence on [[higher category theory]] and [[homotopy theory]] is substantial. For an account of the origins, see [Ronnie Brown's account](http://www.bangor.ac.uk/~mas010/pstacks.htm). Scanned copies of the original typescript are available [here](http://modular.fas.harvard.edu/sga/djvu/Pursuing%20Stacks.tif.djvu) (in djvu, warning: 23MB) and [here](http://www.math.umn.edu/~messing/docs/). Initially many of the copies of this important document were distributed from the School of Mathematics Bangor.  

The manuscript starts with a 12 page letter, dated  19-02-1983, to [[Daniel Quillen]], and then proceeds as a sort of research diary, considering among other things, the notion of $n$-[[n-groupoid|groupoids]] and $\infty$-[[infinity-groupoid|groupoids]], [[homotopy types]] and how to model them, [[homology]] and [[cohomology]] theories defined on categories of models and schematisation of homotopy types. This last is an attempt to define homotopy theory relative to a base ring, say, such that over $\mathbb{Z}$ ordinary homotopy theory is recovered. Due to the almost free-association style of authorship, there are many back-trackings, corrections and erroneous trains of thought. Despite this, the rich ideas lead to conjectures of considerable weight (bad sentence - I need a elf with an English major to help me :P), some of which have been proved by [[Denis-Charles Cisinski]].

[[David Roberts]]: One thing which I'd like to see more in discussions about PS is that many of the ideas presented are now rigorously worked and published, and that it is not just some massive crazy work that merely has great influence.

The themes and ideas, especially those pertaining to the homotopy theory of diagrams, were further developed in [[Les Derivateurs]]. 

To some extent the crux of the explicit link with [[stacks]] is described earlier in three letters from Grothendieck to Breen in 1975. (A commented version of these, other correspondence and the manuscipt (in LaTeX) is being prepared for publication shortly. Much of the material is being collected by the [Grothendeick circle](http://www.grothendieckcircle.org/))
