
##Idea 

The set of [[permutations]] of a set, $X$, form a group, $S_X$, under composition.  This is especially clear if one thinks of the permutation as a [[bijection]] on $X$, where the multiplication / composition is just composition of functions. This group may be denoted $S_X$, $\Sigma_X$, $Sym(X)$, or $X!$.

When $X$ is [[the]] [[finite set]] $(n) = \{1,\dots,n\}$, then its symmetric group is a [[finite group]] of [[cardinality]] $n!$ = "$n$ [[factorial]]", and one typically writes $S_n$ or $\Sigma_n$. 

(We will cross reference to [[permutation]] for some key notation concepts.)



### Representation of elements.

### Example : The symmetric group, $S_3$.

$S_3$ is the group of permutations of $(3)=\{1,2,3\}$.

One simple way to represent an element of $S_3$ is by listing the $(3) on the top row of an array with a second row denoting the image of each element under the permutation.  For instance, the element $sigma= (1\mapsto 2, 2\mapsto 1, 3\mapsto 3)$ can be written more compactly as 

$$\sigma= \left(\array{1&2&3\\2&1&3}\right).$$
