#Idea#

One imagines that from a [[quantum field theory]] one can derive a [[classical field theory]] of which the original quantum field theory may be regarded as a [[quantization]].

What precisely this means and to which degree precisely it makes sense depends on which precise formulation of these concepts one considers. For instance when regarding [[deformation quantization]] as definition the quantum theory then taking the classical limit is an obvious straightforward operation. But in more complete contexts, such as when the [[quantum field theory]] is realized as an [[FQFT]] or [[AQFT]], the passage to the classical limit may be subtle or not make sense at all.

Most prescriptions for taking classical limits are formulated in algebraic settings. To fit for instance a 1-dimensional [[FQFT]] intoo the discussion one is likely to find in the literature, one will have to encode it equivalently in its [[spectral triple]] (as described there) and then proceed with that.

#References#

One method for producing [[classical mechanics]] from a quantum theory is by looking at [[coherent state]]s of the quantum theory: states that have a localized probaility distribution in classical phase space whose center follows the classical equations of motion.
