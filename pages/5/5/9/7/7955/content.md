George Boole (2 November 1815 &#8211; 8 December 1864) was a mathematician and logician, who was the first professor of mathematics at the then Queen's College Cork in Ireland (now University College Cork, (UCC)). He is best known mathematically for his work on algebraic logic which led to the development of [[Boolean algebra]]s. His work is often cited as being one of the first steps towards the invention of computers.

## Selected writings

On [[formal logic]] (for which [[George Boole|Boole]] became widely famous, cf. *[[Boolean algebra]]*) but also on [[probability theory]], where  (as observed by [Pitowsky 1989a](Bell's+inequalities#Pitowsky89a), reviewed, e.g., in [Khrennikov 2008](Bell's+inequalities#Khrennikov08)) Boole's book derives the inequalities that later became known as *[[Bell's inequalities]]* in [[quantum probability theory]]:
