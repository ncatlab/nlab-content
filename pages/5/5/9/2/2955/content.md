Let $C$ be a [[monoidal category]] (in fact one can easily modify all statements to generalize all statements here to bicategories). One can consider several variants of the 2-category of all categories with monoidal action of $C$, (co)lax monoidal functors and their transformations. Categories with action of $C$ are sometimes called __$C$-actegories__. Word module category over $C$ is also used, specially when the category acted upon is in addition also additive, like examples in representation theory.

If $C$-actegory is a [[categorification]] of a module, then for two monoidal categories $C$ and $D$, we should categorify a bimodule, which we call $C$-$D$-biactegory. The two action on a usual bimodule commute, for biactegories the commuting is up to certain coherences, which are in fact the expression of an invertible [[distributive law]] between the two monoidal actions. The tensor product of biactegories can be defined (here the invertibility of the distributive law is needed) as a biequalizer of a certain diagram.

A longer 2006 preprint called "Biactegories" (around 17 pages) has never been finished. It will be linked here later. 

In a language of "module categories" a different treatment is now available in
