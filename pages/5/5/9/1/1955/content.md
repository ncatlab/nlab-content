## Idea

If $A$ is a [[Ring|commutative associative unital ring]], then 
a symmetry of $A$ is an automorphism $g\colon A\to A$, i.e., $g(a b)=g(a)g(b)$. The infinitesimal symmetries are the derivations $X\colon A\to A$, with $X(a b)=X(a)b+X(a)b$. The module of K&#228;hler differentials $\Omega_K(A)$  parametrizes derivations, in the sense that every derivation $X$ corresponds uniquely to a morphism of $A$-modules $\mu_X: \Omega_K(A)\to A$. 

There are (at least) two ways of constructing $\Omega_K(A)$. Maybe the easiest is as follows. The [[bimodule]] of K&#228;hler differentials $\Omega_K(A)$ over $A$ is generated by $d a$ for all $a\in A$, subject to relations 

1. $d(a b)=(d a)b+a(d b)$,
2. $d(a+b)=d a+d b$, and
3. $(d a)b = b(d a)$.

In particular there are only finite sums in the bimodule of K&#228;hler differentials.

Another construction of $\Omega_K(A)$ is given below.

Instead of just looking at derivations from $A$ to itself we can consider derivations on $A$ with values in any module $M$. These are still parametrized by (maps out of) $\Omega_K(A)$, and the point of K&#228;hler differentials becomes a [[universal property|universality property]]: if $X:A\to M$ is any [[derivation]] from a [[Ring|commutative associative unital ring]] $A$ to an $A$-[[module]] $M$, then there is a unique $A$-module morphism $\mu_X:\Omega_K(A)\to M$ such that $X(a)=\mu_X(d a)$, and conversely, for each $A$-module morphism $\mu:\Omega_K(A)\to M$ there is a derivation from $A$ to $M$, satisfying that relation.
In terms of a commutative diagram:
$$
\array{
A&\overset{X}\to     & M\\
 & \underset{D}\searr&\uparrow \mu_X\\
 &                   & \Omega_K{A}
}
$$


## Definition

We can replace the ring $A$ more generally by  a [[morphism]] of [[commutative unital rings]] $f:R\to S$. Then the __module of K&#228;hler differentials__ is the $S$-[[module]] $\Omega^1_{S/R}$ corepresenting the functor

$$Der_R(S,f_*(-)) : S Mod\to Set : M\mapsto Der_R(S,f_* M)$$

that assigns to every $S$-[[module]] $M$ the [[set]] of [[derivation]]s on $S$ with values in the (bi)module $f_* M$, where $f_*:S Mod\to R Mod$ is the restriction of scalars. 

In other words,  $Der_R(S,f_*M)\cong Hom_S(\Omega^1_{S/R},M)$. In a diagram: for every $R$-derivation $X\colon S \to M$ there is a unique morphism (of $S$-modules) $\mu\colon \Omega^1_{S/R} \to M$ making the following diagram commute:

$$
\array{
S&\overset{X}\to     & M\\
 & \underset{D}\searr&\uparrow \mu\\
 &                   & \Omega^1_{S/R}
}
$$


## K&#228;hler forms

Here we give another construction of the module of Kaehler differentials, instead of the generators and relations defintion given above for commutative rings $A$. 

Let $I$ be the [[augmentation ideal]], i.e. the kernel of the multiplication map

$$ I := Ker(m:S\otimes_R S\to S)$$

Then $\Omega^1_{S/R}= I/I^2$ and there is a canonical induced map $d: S\to \Omega^1_{S/R}$
given by $d s = [1\otimes s - s\otimes 1]$. 


Similarly, if $R$ is in characteristic zero, one introduces **K&#228;hler $p$-forms** , which are elements of the $p$-th [[exterior power]] $\Omega^p_{S/R}:=\Lambda_R^p \Omega^1_{S/R}$. The [[module]] of K&#228;hler differentials readily generalizes as a [[sheaf]] of K&#228;hler differentials for a separated morphism $f:X\to Y$ of (commutative) [[schemes]], namely it is the [[pullback]] along the embedding of the ideal sheaf of the [[diagonal subobject|diagonal subscheme]] $X\hookrightarrow X\times_Y X$.

Compare the role of [[universal differential envelope]] and [[Amitsur complex]] for  analogous constructions in the noncommutative case. The appropriate extension of the module of relative K&#228;hler differentials to the derived setting is the [[cotangent complex]] of Grothendieck--Illusie. 


## Relation to ordinary forms

Since there are only finite sums in the module of K&#228;hler differentials, the usual $d f=f' d t$ works only if $f$ is a finite polynomial in $t$, say, if $A$ is $C^\infty(R)$ or power series. For example, let $f = t^n$ then

$$\begin{aligned}
d f &= 
d(t^n)  \\
&= t^{n-1} d t  + t(d t^{n-1}) \\
&= 2 t^{n-1} d t + t^2 d(t^{n-2}) \\
&= r t^{n-1} d t + t^r d(t^{n-r}) \\
&= n t^{n-1} d t \\
&= f' d t.
\end{aligned}$$


However, we have

$$d e^t \ne e^t d t$$

as K&#228;hler differentials, essentially because $d$ cannot pass through the infinite sum

$$d e^t = d\left(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{t^n}{n!}\right) \ne \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{d(t^n)}{n!} = e^t d t.$$

Let us call $\Omega^1(A)$ the $A$-bimodule of usual 1-forms. In that case $A=C^\infty(R)$ and any $A$-bimodule morphism $\mu:\Omega_K(A)\to M$ factors through the ordinary 1-forms: 


$$\mu:\Omega_K(A)\to\Omega^1(A)\to M$$


in case $M$ is free, in particular if $M=A$. This is equivalent to the fact that all derivations of the $C^\infty$ functions are of the form $f(t)\frac{d}{d t}$. This is not true for power series, there there are crazy derivations such that $X(t)=1$, but $X(e^t)=0$.
