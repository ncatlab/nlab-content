## Idea

A [[setoid]] or [[Bishop set]] whose [[quotient set]] is a [[field]]. 

“Field setoid” and "Bishop field" are placeholder names for a concept which may or may not have another name in the mathematics literature. 

## Definition

Let $R$ be a [[commutative ring setoid]]. An element $a \in R$ is [[invertible element|invertible]] if there exists an element $b \in R$ such that $a \cdot b \sim 1$. 

A **field setoid** or **Bishop field** is a [[commutative ring setoid]] $F$ in which for every element $a \in F$, $a$ is invertible if and only if $a \sim 0$ is false. 

### Constructive notions

Similarly to the case for [[fields]], there are different notions for field setoids in constructive mathematics. These include

* discrete field setoids

* Heyting field setoids 

* weak Heyting field setoids

* Kock field setoids

\begin{definition}
A **discrete field setoid** is a [[commutative ring setoid]] $F$ in which for every element $a \in F$, either $a \sim 0$ or $a$ is invertible. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A **weak Heyting field setoid** is a [[commutative ring setoid]] $F$ in which for every element $a \in F$, $a$ is not invertible if and only if $a \sim 0$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A **Heyting field setoid** is a weak Heyting field setoid which is also a [[local ring setoid]]. 
\end{definition}

## Examples

* Given any [[Archimedean ordered field]] $F$, the set of [[Cauchy sequences]] in $F$ is a field setoid. In constructive mathematics, the set of Cauchy sequences in $F$ is only a Heyting field setoid.
