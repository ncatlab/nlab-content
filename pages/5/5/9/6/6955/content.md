## Idea

Operads -- or rather [[(∞,1)-operads]] such as given by [[topological operads]] or [[dendroidal sets]] -- form an [[(∞,1)-category]], and hence there is canonically a notion of [[cohomology]] associated with them, given as the sets of [[homotopy]] classes of [[morphism]]s out of a given operad into a given coefficient operad.

Explicitly this has been considered in ([Rezk](#Rezk)).
