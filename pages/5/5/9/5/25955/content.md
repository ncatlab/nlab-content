## Idea

The $p$-adic local Langlands correspondence is a version of the [[local Langlands correspondence]] where the representations are over a $p$-adic field, i.e. on one side we have certain $E$-representations of $G(F)$ (for $G$ some reductive group), and on the other we have certain $E$-representations of $\mathrm{Gal}(\overline{F}/F)$, where $E$ and $F$ are both finite extensions of $\mathbb{Q}_{p}$. It should be compatible with the [[mod p local Langlands correspondence]]. The only case that is known is when $G=\mathrm{GL}_{2}$ and $F=\mathbb{Q}_{p}$.

An approach to realizing one direction of the p-adic local Langlands correspondence using patching was developed in [#CEGGPS2013](#CEG+2013). An approach going in the other direction was developed in [#Scholze2015](#Scholze2015). These two constructions are compatible with each other.
