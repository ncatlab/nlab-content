## Idea

Langlands functoriality is a generalization of [[Langlands program|Langlands conjectures]] that essentially tells us that a $L$-homomorphism
$${}^L G\to {}^L H$$
between the [L-groups](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langlands_dual) of two [[reductive algebraic group|reductive groups]] over $\Q$ should induce a transfer map from automorphic representations for $G$ to automorphic representations of $H$.

## Known results

Langlands functoriality is now known in the case of the natural embedding $G\subset \GL_n$ of a classical ([[orthogonal group|orthogonal]], [[symplectic group|symplectic]] or [[unitary group|unitary]]) group in the [[general linear group]] through its canonical representation, following the work of [[James Arthur]] on the [[Arthur-Selberg trace formula]] and on endoscopy for classical groups.

It is also known (starting from Jacquet and Langlands' work for $\GL_2$) in the case of inner forms of a group: there is an equivalence between automorphic representations on the group and automorphic representations on its inner form. This was used by Harris and Taylor to prove instances of the local Langlands correspondence for $\GL_n$ by using unitary [[Shimura varieties]] associated to some twisted (unitary) forms of $\GL_n$.

James Newton and Jack Thorne proved [[symmetric power]] functoriality for holomorphic [[modular forms]] in [NewtonThorne19](#NewtonThorne19) and [NewtonThorne20](#NewtonThorne20).
