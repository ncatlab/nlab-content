Given an $A$-[[coring]] or even a more general additive [[comonad]] with a [[grouplike element]] there are several related (but in general nonequivalent) notions of connections.

As explained in [[grouplike element]], to an $A$-coring $C$ with a grouplike elements one associates a [[semi-free differential graded algebra]] $\Omega A = \Omega(A,C)$, sometimes called its (generalized) Amitsur complex. The simplest notion of a connection for the coring $C$ is a [[connection for a differential graded algebra|connection]] for the corresponding Amitsur complex.
