Given a homomorphism of rings $f^\circ:R\to S$ the functor $-\otimes_R - = f^\star : {}_R Mod\to {}_S Mod$ given on objects by ${}_R M\mapsto {}_S S\otimes_R M$ is called the __extension of scalars__; an alternative name is sometimes the __induction functor__. There are similar functors for right modules, bimodules and in some other categories. 

$f^\circ$ may be viewed as the opposite of the morphism of affine schemes $f:Spec S\to Spec R$. If we so look at the category $Ring^{op}$ then there is a fibered category $Mod\to Ring^{op}$ where the [[inverse image functor]] is the extension of scalars. For that reason if there is some other fibered category $\mathcal{F}$ over the opposite of some algebraic category $\mathcal{A}$ whose objects are considered "objects of scalars" one is inclined to call the inverse image functor, the extension of scalars.
