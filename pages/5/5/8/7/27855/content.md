## Idea 
 {#Idea}

*Discrete homotopy theory* (also known as *A-homotopy theory*) is an area of mathematics concerned with using techniques of [[homotopy theory]] to study combinatorial properties of [[graphs]]. It does so by introducing a new combinatorial notion of homotopy between graph maps and subsequently reinterpreting the usual homotopy-theoretic invariants, such as [[homotopy group|homotopy]] or [[homology groups]], through the lenses of this new notion.
