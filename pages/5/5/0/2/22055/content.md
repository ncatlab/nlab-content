
In the context of fixed [[triangulations]] of spacetime arising in [[spin foam models]], the [[10j symbol]] is a spin network that arises in the partition function for the [[Barrett-Crane model]] of [[Riemannian quantum gravity]]. [[Greg Egan]], [[J. Daniel Christensen]], and [[John Baez]] formulated an algorithm in C++ to describe these symbols that arise in this discrete [[spin foam model]]. 

##Definition

A [[10j symbol]] is a spin(4) [[spin network]] containing five vertices and ten edges, where the edges are labels by [[spins]]. This symbol can be understood as a function which receives ten spins as input and produces a complex number as output, this process underpins the calculation of the partition function for the [[Barrett-Crane model]], which depends on the contraction of tensors at the vertices.
