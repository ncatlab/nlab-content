## Quotes

On [[mathematical physics]]:

> One should keep the need for a sound mathematical basis dominating one’s search for a new theory. Any physical or philosophical ideas that one has must be adjusted to  fit the mathematics. Not the way round. 

> Too many physicists are inclined to start from some preconceived physical ideas and then to try to develop them and ﬁnd a mathematical scheme that incorporates them.  Such a line of attack is unlikely to lead to success. One runs into difficulties and ﬁnds no  reasonable way out of them. One ought then to realize that one’s whole line of approach  is wrong and to seek a new starting point with a sound mathematical basis.
