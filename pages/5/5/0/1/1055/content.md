Let $Top$ be a category of topological spaces and $B$ an object in $Top$ ('base'). The slice category $Top/B$ is called the category of (topological) spaces over $B$ (or sometimes simply bundles).  

An __space__ (or _&#233;tale map_) over $B$ is an object $p:E\to B$ in $Top/B$ such that $p$ is local homeomorphism, that is for every $e\in E$, there is an open neighborhood $U\ni e$, such that $p(U)$ is open in $B$ and the restriction $p|_{p(U)}:U\to p(U)$ is a homeomorphism. The set $E_x = p^{-1}(x)$ where $x\in U$ is called the __stalk__ of $p$ over $x$. Underlying set of the _total space_ $E$ (from 'espace') is union of its stalks (notice that we do not say fiber!). $p$ is sometimes refered to as projection. 

Let $p:E\to B$ be in $Top/B$. (Local) __sections__ of $p$ over an open set $U$ are the continuous maps $s:U\to E$ such that $p\circ s = \mathrm{id}_U$. It is an elementary but central fact that for an &#233;tale map $p$, _the images of local sections make a base of topology_ of the total space $E$. The topology of $E$ is then typically non-Hausdorff. 

The set of section of $p$ over $U$ is denoted by $\Gamma_U p = (\Gamma p)(U) = \Gamma_U E = (\Gamma E)(U)$ and may be shown to extend to a functor $\Gamma : Top/B\to PShv_B$ where $PShv_B$ is the category of presheaves over $B$. 
Functor $\Gamma$ has a left adjoint $L : PShv_B\to Top/B$. The essential image of functor $L$ is the full subcategory $Et/B$ of &#233;tale spaces over $B$, while the essential image of functor $\Gamma$ is the category of sheaves over $X$. This adjunction restricts to the category equivalence between $Et/B$ and $PShv_B$.

If $P:Open(X)^{op}\to Set$ is a sheaf, then one sometimes calls the total space $E(P)$ of the &#233;tale space $L(P) = (E(P)\to B)$ the 'space of the sheaf' $P$, having in mind the adjoint equivalence above. The associated sheaf functor $a:PShv_B\to Shv_B\hookrightarrow PShv_B$ decomposes as $a = \Gamma\circ L$, and $a$ may be considered as an endofunctor part of an [[idempotent monad]] in $PShv_B$ whose corresponding [[reflective subcategory]] is $Shv_B$.

Every [[covering space]] (in more general sense not requiring any connectedness axiom) is &#233;tale but not viceversa: for a covering space the inverse image of some open set in the base $B$ needs to be by the definition a disjoint union of homeomorphic open sets in $E$; however the 'size' of the neighborhoods over various $e$ in the same stalk required in the definition of &#233;tale space may differ, hence the intersection of their projections does not need to be an open set.
