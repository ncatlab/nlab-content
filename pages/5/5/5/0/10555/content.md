A __Sabinin algebra__ (earlier defined as a hyperalgebra, not to mix with older notion of a hyperalgebra of an affine algebraic group in prime characteristic, obtained by certain completion) is a vector space with a family of operations...
(under construction)
satisfying axioms
...

Applications: tangent algebra to local smooth multiplicative systems.
