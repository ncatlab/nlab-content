## Idea
 
For an object $X$ of a [[coherent category]] $C$, consider $\mathcal{B}(X)$, the Boolean algebra of complemented subobjects of $X$, and then $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{B}(X))$, the set of all non-empty [[filters]] of $\mathcal{B}(X)$, partially ordered by reverse inclusion.

Then $X$ is said to be **filtral** if there exists a lattice isomorphism

$$
Sub(X) \cong \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{B}(X)).
$$

Furthermore, the category $C$ is said to be **filtral** if each of its objects is covered by a filtral one, that is, for every $Y$ in $C$ there is a [[regular epimorphism]] with $X$ filtral ([Marra-Reggio 18, Sec. 4](#MarraReggio)).
