## Idea

_Differential characters_ &lbrack;[Cheeger & Simons 1985](#CheegerSimons85)&rbrack; are one geometric model for the [[differential cohomology]]-refinement of [[integral cohomology|integral]] [[ordinary cohomology]] -- i.e. of the [[cohomology theory]] [[Brown representability theorem|represented]] by the [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum]] $K(-,\mathbb{Z})$.

Accordingly, Cheeger-Simons differential characters model [[circle n-bundles with connection]] ($U(1)$-$(n-1)$-[[gerbes]]) and as such are equivalent to other models for these structures, notably to [[Deligne cohomology]]. For $n=1$ these are ordinary [[connection on a bundle|connections]] on ordinary [[circle group]]-[[principal bundles]].

The definition of CS-differential characters encodes rather directly the higher dimensional notion of [[parallel transport]] of such higher connections: a CS-character is a rule that assigns values in the [[circle group]] $U(1)$ (whence "[[character]]") to $n$-dimensional [[smooth manifolds]] $\Sigma_n \to X$ in a [[smooth manifold]] $X$, such that whenever $\Sigma_n = \partial \Sigma_{n+1}$ is the [[boundary of a manifold|boundary]] of a $\phi \colon \Sigma_{n+1} \to X$, this assignment coincides with the [[integration of differential forms|integral]] $\int_{\Sigma_{n+1}} \phi^* F$ of the [[pullback of differential forms|pullback]] of a [[curvature]] $(n+1)$-form $F \in \Omega^{n+1}_{cl}(X)$.


## As secondary characteristic classes

Since Cheeger-Simons characters enocde information beyond the [[curvature characteristic form]] which represents the underlying [[characteristic class]] in de Rham cohomology, they are frequently called *[[secondary characteristic classes]]*, in particular if the curvature characteristic form vanishes so that the corresponding [[Chern-Simons form]] becomes [[closed differential form|closed]].
