An $n$-groupoid is an $\infty$-[[infinity-category|category]] that is both an $\infty$-[[infinity-groupoid|groupoid]] and an $n$-[[n-category|category]].

Specifically, we have:
* every $j$-morphism (at any level) is an [[equivalence]];
* every parallel pair of $j$-morphisms is equivalent, for $j > n$.

An $n$-groupoid is the same thing as an $(n,0)$-category in the sense of $(n,r)$[[(n,r)-category|categories]]. 

Accordingy to the [[homotopy hypothesis]], every $n$-groupoid is the [[fundamental infinity-groupoid]] of some [[homotopy n-type]], and this is unique up to equivalence.
