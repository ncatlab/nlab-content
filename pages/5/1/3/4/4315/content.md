## Idea

Bibundles are principal $G$ bundles with commuting left and right $G$ actions.

A right principal bibundle between two groupoids $G$ and $H$ is a set $P$ with a $G$-$H$ biaction such that the map from $P$ to the objects of $G$ is surjective and such that the fibers are acted on by $H$ freely and transitively. See [discussion](http://sbseminar.wordpress.com/2007/07/23/a-bicategory-of-groupoids/)

Let "$(H, G)$&#8230; be a [[2-group]]. An $(H, G)$&#8230;-bibundle is a (right) principal $G$-bundle with an equivariant map $\phi: P \to H$. [Murray's talk](http://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/digitalAssets/7050_Murray.pdf)

For Lie groupoid $G$, a left (right) $G$-bundle $E$ over $X$ (equipped with  $\tau: X \to M$) is a left (right) $G$-action on $E$, and a $G$-invariant map
$\pi: E  \to M$. A $G$-$H$-bibundle $E$ is a left $G$-bundle and a right $H$-bundle. [Morton talk](http://www.math.uwo.ca/~jmorton9/seminar/gpdrep.pdf)
