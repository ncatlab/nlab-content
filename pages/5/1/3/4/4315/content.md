## Idea

A bibundle is a [[bundle]] with compatible [[actions]] on the left and right.

Note that the general concept of [[bundle]] has no action and so there is nothing to do to make it a bibundle.  However, suppose that $G$ is a [[group]] and you are interested in [[G-bundle]]s.  Then a __$G$-bibundle__ is a bundle that is simultaneously a left $G$-bundle and a right $G$-bundle, such that the left and right actions of $G$ commute.

A __principal bibundle__ is a [[principal bundle|principal]] $G$-bundles with commuting left and right $G$-actions.

More generally, a __right principal bibundle__ between two groupoids $G$ and $H$ is a set $P$ with a $G$-$H$ [[biaction]] such that the map from $P$ to the objects of $G$ is surjective and such that the fibers are acted on by $H$ freely and transitively. See [discussion](http://sbseminar.wordpress.com/2007/07/23/a-bicategory-of-groupoids/).

Or, let $(H, G)$&#8230; be a [[2-group]]. Then an __$(H, G)$&#8230;-bibundle__ is a (right) principal $G$-bundle with an equivariant map $\phi: P \to H$. See [Murray's talk](http://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/digitalAssets/7050_Murray.pdf).

For a [[Lie groupoid]] $G$, a left (right) $G$-bundle $E$ over $X$ (equipped with  $\tau: X \to M$) is a left (right) $G$-action on $E$, and a $G$-invariant map
$\pi: E  \to M$. Then a __$G$-$H$-bibundle__ $E$ is a left $G$-bundle and a right $H$-bundle. See [Morton's talk](http://www.math.uwo.ca/~jmorton9/seminar/gpdrep.pdf).

Now let $G$ and $H$ be Lie groupoids. A [[manifold]] $M$ with a left $G$-action and a right $H$-action which commute, i.e., $(g \cdot m) \cdot h = g \cdot (m \cdot h)$, whenever defined, is called a __smooth $G$-$H$ bibundle__. See Definition 2.8 in _[Stacky Lie Groupoids](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0702399)_.
