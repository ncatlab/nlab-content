## Definitions

A [[complex number]] $z$ is __purely imaginary__ if its [[real part]] $\Re{z}$ is [[zero]], hence if under [[complex conjugation]] we have $\overline{z} = - z$.  The complex number $z$ is __imaginary__ if it is not [[real number|real]], in other words if $z \ne \Re{z}$, or equivalently if its [[imaginary part]] $\Im{z}$ is nonzero, or if $ z \ne \overline{z}$.  (In [[constructive mathematics]], we mean [[apartness]] here.)

The same terminology applies to [[quaternions]], [[octonions]], and other $*$-[[star-algebra|algebras]] of [[hypercomplex numbers]]. (In yet other $*$-algebras, such as in [[matrix algebras]], one tends to say "skew-[[hermitian matrix|hermitian]]" instead of "purely imaginary". There is no clear analogue of "imaginary" here since $z \notin \mathbb{R}$ and $z \ne \overline{z}$ diverge.)

Beware that often one says just "imaginary" for "purely imaginary".  (For example, $2 + 3\mathrm{i}$ is imaginary but not purely imaginary; while $0$ is the unique purely imaginary number that is not imaginary.)  This may be because the imaginary numbers, as is typical for things defined by an [[inequality]], do not form an interesting collection as a whole (for example, they are not even closed under addition).  Compare [[irrational number]].

The purely imaginary complex numbers, on the other hand, form the [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{u}(1)$.  Often one substitutes $\mathbb{R}$ (the algebra of real numbers), which is simpler, when one only cares about this Lie algebra up to [[isomorphism]].  However, using $\mathrm{i}\mathbb{R}$ (the algebra of purely imaginary numbers) makes $\mathfrak{u}(1)$ fit with the [[matrix]] formulas used in higher dimensions.
