## Idea

The field of _quantum biology_ studies non-trivial effects of [[quantum mechanics]] in biological systems, typically in molecular biology.

To the extent that biology is based on [[chemistry]] it is ultimately based on [[quantum chemistry]]. But since biological systems are typically "warm" and "wet" relative to the cold and evacuated experimental setups in which quantum effects are usually seen and studied, quantum effects beyond those that account for the existence of [[molecules]] etc. in the first place have been thought and argued to be generally negligible in biology. But there have been arguments that some key mechanisms in biology might rely on macroscopic quantum coherence/[[quantum superposition]] in a crucial way.

{#Photosynthesis} This includes notably [[photosynthesis]], which has been argued to depend, if not qualitatively at least quantitatively, on macroscopic [[quantum entanglement]]/[[quantum superposition]] &lbrack;[Sarovar et al. 2010](#SIFW10)&rbrack;. However, meanwhile this claim seems to have been conclusively dismissed &lbrack;cf. [Duan et al. 2017](#DuanEtAl17), [Cao et al. 2020](#Cao20)&rbrack;

Very speculative but prominently promoted by mathematician [[Roger Penrose]], based on joint work with [[Stuart Hameroff]], is the idea that macroscopic [[quantum superposition]] in [[microtubules]] inside [[neurons]] is the source of the still mostly mysterious characteristic 40[[Hz]] [[oscillations]] seen in brain [[EEG]]s. (In fact, [[Penrose]] goes much further and suggests that [[quantum state collapse|collapse]] of this superposition by [[quantum gravity]]-effects is a source of non-[[computability]] in [[physics]] and also somehow the source of [[consciousness]] in [[biology]], see at _[orch OR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestrated_objective_reduction)_ for further pointers on this).
