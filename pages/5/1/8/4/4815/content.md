## Idea

In theories of [[gravity]] and [[cosmology]] a _cosmological constant_ refers to an [[energy]] contribution associated with the [[vacuum]] itself.

This is called a _cosmological constant_ because the simplest way to see this effect in [[theory (physics)|theory]] is by a summand to the [[Einstein-Hilbert action]] which is proportional to the [[volume]] of [[spacetime]], with proportionality factor some "constant" $\lambda$, as in  (eq:EinsteinHilbertWithCosmologicalConstant) below.

See below 

* _[In classical gravity](#InClassicalGravity)_

More generally, almost-constant contributions to matter fields may effectively have the same kind of effect.

Specifically in [[perturbative quantum field theory]] [[AQFT on curved spacetimes|on curved spacetimes]] the [[vacuum expectation value]] of the [[stress-energy tensor]] of the various [[matter]]-fields receives constant or essentially constant contributions, notably from [[renormalization]] freedom (e.g. [Hack 15, section 3.2.1](#Hack15)). 

See below

* _[In perturbative quantum gravity](#InPerturbativeQuantumGravity)_

In [[perturbative string theory]] the [[string perturbation series]] associated with a [[2d SCFT]] is (supposedly) UV-finite and hence has "chosen its own [[renormalization]]" already, hence here the cosmological constant may in principle be read off from a choice of [[perturbative string theory vacuum]]. See below 

* _[In string theory](#ReferencesInStringTheory)_


Observation shows that the effective cosmological constant of the [[observable universe]] is comparatively small but [[positive real number|positive]], see 

* _[Observation](#Observation)_.


 
## Details

### In classical gravity
 {#InClassicalGravity}

In an [[action functional]] on a space of [[pseudo-Riemannian manifolds]] -- such as the [[Einstein-Hilbert action]] functional for [[gravity]] -- a **cosmological constant** is a term proportional to the [[volume]] 

$$
  S_{cc} \;\colon\;  (X,g) \mapsto \lambda \int_X dvol_g
  \,,
$$

where $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ is the _cosmological constant_ .

For instance, pure Einstein-Hilbert gravity with cosmological constant (and no other fields) is given by the functional

$$
  \label{EinsteinHilbertWithCosmologicalConstant}
  S_{EH} + S_{cc} :  (X,g) \mapsto \int_X R\, dvol + \lambda \int_X d vol_g
  \,,
$$

Generically it happens that one considers action functionals where $\lambda$ is in fact not a constant, but a function of other fields $\phi$ on $X$. 

$$
  S \;\colon\; (X,g,\phi) \mapsto \int_X \lambda(\phi) dvol_g
  \,.
$$

In this context those solutions to the [[Euler-Lagrange equation]]s are of interest in which $\lambda(\phi)$ happens to be exactly or approximately constant. Many such models of not-really-constant-but-effectively-constant terms proportional to the volume are being proposed and considered in attempts to explain observed or speculated dynamics of the cosmos.

See in particular at _[[FRW model]]_ for the role of the cosmological constant in homogeneous and isotropic models as in the [[standard model of cosmology]]. In that context the cosmological constant is also called the _dark energy_ (density), which makes up about 70% of the energy density of the [[observable universe]] (the rest being [[dark matter]]) and a comparatively little bit of [[baryon|baryonic]] [[matter]].


### In perturbative quantum gravity
 {#InPerturbativeQuantumGravity}

In [[perturbative quantum field theory]] [[QFT on curved spacetime|on curved spacetimes]] the cosmological constant receives contributions from the [[vacuum expectation value]] of the [[stress-energy tensor]] of the [[matter]] [[field (physics)|fields]]. There is [[renormalization]]-freedom in this contribution  ([Wald 78](#Wald78), [Tichy-Flanagan 98](#TichyFlanagan98) [Moretti 01](#Moretti01)). 

Explicitly for [[FRW models]] this is discussed in ([Dappiaggi-Fredenhagen-Pinamonti 08](#DappiaggiFredenhagenPinamonti08), [Dappiagi-Hack-Moeller-Pinamonti 10](#DappiagiHackMollerPinamonti10)).
Specifically for the [[standard model of cosmology]] see ([Hack 13, around (4)](#Hack13)).

A useful review is in ([Hack 15, section 3.2.1](#Hack15)).

This means that apart from the freedom of choosing a classical comsological constant in the [[Einstein-Hilbert action]] as above, its [perturbative quantization](A+first+idea+of+quantum+field+theory#InteractingQuantumFields) ([[perturbative quantum gravity]]) introduces [[renormalization]] freedom to the value of the cosmological constant.

The folklore discussion of the "cosmological constant problem" (see the references [below](#CCProblemReferences)) tends not to take this freedom in the theory into account (see the discussion at _[[naturalness]]_).

### In inhomogeneous cosmology
 {#InInhomogeneousCosmology}

It has been suggested the observed cosmological constant/dark energy may be but an artifact of the overly idealistic approximation of cosmic homogeneity, and that a more accurate [[inhomogeneous cosmology]] would not need to assume any dark energy (e.g. [Buchert 07](#Buchert07), [Buchert 11](#Buchert11), [Buchert-Rasanen 11](#BucherRasanen11), [Scharf 13](#Scharf13)).

A seminal argument that it _is_ consistent to neglect cosmic inhomogeneity due to ([Green-Wald 10](#GreenWald10), [Green-Wald 13](#GreenWald13)), has been called into question in [Buchert et al. 15](#BuchertEtAl15), where it is concluded that the question is more subtle and remains open. Recent review is in [Belejko-Korzyński 16](#BelejkoKorzynski16).

If the apparent small positive [[cosmological constant]] were but an artifact of neglecting backreaction of inhomegeneities, some theoretical puzzlements regarding [[quantum gravity]] on [[de Sitter spacetimes]] would disappear (see [Rajaraman 16](de+Sitter+spacetime#Rajaraman16) for general discussion and [Danielsson-VanRiet 18, p. 27](#DanielssonVanRiet18) for discussion of [[perturbative string theory vacua]]).
