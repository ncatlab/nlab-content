## Idea

Just as a [[smooth set]] is a [[generalized smooth space]] in [[differential geometry]] modeled as a [[sheaf]] on the [[category]] of [[Cartesian spaces]] with [[smooth functions]] between them, so a **super smooth set** is a sheaf on the category of [[super Cartesian spaces]], being a generalized space in [[supergeometry]].

Since super smooth sets contain [[infinitesimal spaces]], it makes good sense to make this explicit and consider **super formal smooth sets** right away, hence [[sheaves]] on [[super formal Cartesian spaces]]

For details see at _[[geometry of physics -- supergeometry]]_.
