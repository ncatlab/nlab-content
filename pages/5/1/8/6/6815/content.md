## Idea

There are two types of [[black brane]] solutions in [[11-dimensional supergravity]], one of dimension $2+1$, one of dimension 5+1. These are thought to correspond to a fundamental 2-brane and its [[electric-magnetic duality|EM dual]], called the

* [[M2-brane]] ([[fractional M2-brane]])

* [[M5-brane]] ([[half M5-brane]])

* [[MK6-brane]]

* [[MO9-brane]]

* [[M-wave]]

The M2-brane carries [[electric charge]] under the [[supergravity C-field]]. The M5-brane is the dual magnetic charge.

## Properties

[[brane intersection|intersecting]] M-branes:

* [[M5-MO9 brane bound state]]

* [[M2-M5 brane bound state]]

  * [[M-string]], [[E-string]]

* [[membrane triple junction]]
