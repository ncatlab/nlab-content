The ordinary homotopy groups of a space $X$ are 

$$
\pi_n(X) = \pi^{S^0}_n(X) = [\Sigma^n S^0, X] = [S^n, X],
$$

where $S^0$ is the 0-sphere. We can choose other based spaces, $A$. Thus,

$$
\pi^{A}_n(X) = [\Sigma^n A, X],
$$

are the generalized homotopy groups of $X$ with (co)-coefficients in $A$.

But should this page, mentioning Eilenberg-Steenrod, be about generalized _stable_ homotopy. I.e., should we focus on $\Sigma^n A$ as a spectrum? Mind you, in [[spectrum]] it requires $E_n \cong \Omega E_{n + 1}$, where $\Omega$ denotes the based loop space. Don't we want the requirement $E_{n + 1} \cong \Sigma E_n$? Need to check whether adjunction means this makes no difference.
