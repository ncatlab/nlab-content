An __$n$-functor__ is simply a [[functor]] between $n$-[[n-category|categories]].  Similarly, an __$\infty$-functor__ is a functor between $\infty$-[[infinity-category|categories]].

Of course, as the definition of $n$-category gets more complicated as $n$ increases, so does the appropriate definition of functor.  This explains why one says '$n$-functor' instead of simply 'functor' all along.  On the other hand, anything that goes between $n$-categories, if it deserves to be called anything like 'functor' at all, will be an $n$-functor, so the prefix is not really necessary.


## Special cases:

*  [[function]]
*  [[functor]]
*  [[2-functor]], including [[pseudo functor]]
