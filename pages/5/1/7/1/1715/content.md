## Idea

An __$n$-functor__ is simply a [[functor]] between $n$-[[n-category|categories]].  Similarly, an __$\infty$-functor__ is a functor between $\infty$-[[infinity-category|categories]].

Of course, as the definition of $n$-category gets more complicated as $n$ increases, so does the appropriate definition of functor.  This explains why one says '$n$-functor' instead of simply 'functor' all along.  On the other hand, anything that goes between $n$-categories, if it deserves to be called anything like 'functor' at all, will be an $n$-functor, so the prefix is not really necessary.

An $n$-[[n-natural transformation|natural transformation]] goes between $n$-functors, and there are things to go between those as well, etc.  The most general concept is an $n$-$k$-[[transfor]].


## Special cases

*  [[implication]] (a $(-1)$-[[(-1)-functor|functor]])
*  [[function]] (a $0$-[[0-functor|functor]])
*  [[functor]] (a $1$-[[1-functor|functor]])
*  [[2-functor]], including [[pseudo functor]]
*  etc
