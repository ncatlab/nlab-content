Villani extensively worked on the topic of optimal transport and its applications to differential geometry. Villani was awarded the Fields medal at Hyderabad in 2010 for the study of Boltzmann equation (especially its hydrodynamic limit) and nonlinear Landau damping,

Villani is a director of the Institut Henri Poincar&#233; in Paris and holds a part time research appointment at IH&#201;S.
