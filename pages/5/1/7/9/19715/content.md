## Idea

### In set theory/category theory

In a [[constructive mathematics|constructive]] [[weakly predicative]] [[structural set theory]], such as doing mathematics in a [[well-pointed category|well-pointed]] [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]] [[lextensive category|lextensive]] [[coherent category]] with a [[natural numbers object]], it is still possible to define a [[category]] inside of the set theory, and in particular, it is still possible to define a [[well-pointed category|well-pointed]] [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]] [[lextensive category|lextensive]] [[coherent category]] [[category object|object]] with a [[natural numbers object]] inside of any [[well-pointed category|well-pointed]] [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]] [[lextensive category|lextensive]] [[coherent category]] with a [[natural numbers object]]. These objects are called [[universes]] or [[Grothendieck universes]] $\mathcal{U}$ in [[structural set theory]]. From here, one could form the [[subcategory|sub]]-[[(0,1)-category]] of [[subterminal objects]] $\Omega_\mathcal{U}$ in $\mathcal{U}$, the set of $\mathcal{U}$-small [[subsingletons]], and subsingletons model [[propositions]] in the universe, so could be called a set of $\mathcal{U}$-small propositions as well. 

If a set theory has multiple such universes $\mathcal{U}$ and $\mathcal{V}$, then there are multiple such sets of propositions, one of which is $\mathcal{U}$-small, and another one of which is $\mathcal{V}$-small. In general, the set of $\mathcal{U}$-small propositions $\Omega_\mathcal{U}$ and the set of $\mathcal{V}$-small propositions $\Omega_\mathcal{V}$ cannot be proven to be equivalent to each other. However, **propositional resizing** is the axiom that for universe $\mathcal{U}$ and $\mathcal{V}$, the set of $\mathcal{U}$-small propositions is in bijection with the set of $\mathcal{V}$-small propositions, $\Omega_\mathcal{U} \cong \Omega_\mathcal{V}$. 

### In type theory

In [[homotopy type theory]], the type of [[h-propositions]] of a [[Tarski universe]] (or [[Russell universe]]) $U$ is not in general [[essentially small type|essentially $U$-small]]. Propositional resizing is then the statement that the type of h-propositions is essentially $U$-small. 

There is a separate axiom of propositional resizing for a hierarchy of universes, where the type of h-propositions of each universe, where one universe embeds into the other universe, are equivalent to each other. 

Propositional resizing is a form of [[impredicativity]] for h-propositions, and by avoiding its use, the universe or hierarchy is said to remain predicative.

However, when using Tarski universes, while universes and universe hierarchies may be impredicative, the overarching type theory is still predicative if it has a judgment '$A \; \mathrm{type}$', since it is impossible to talk about all types. 

## Definition

### In set theory/category theory

We work in a [[structural set theory]] which externally forms a [[well-pointed category|well-pointed]] [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]] [[lextensive category|lextensive]] [[coherent category]] with a [[natural numbers object]], namely a structural set theory with 

* [[sets]] and [[functions]] as basic objects
* the [[axiom of extensionality]]
* an [[empty set]]
* a [[singleton]]
* binary [[products]]
* binary [[disjoint unions]] which are [[van Kampen colimit|van Kampen]]
* [[fibers]]
* [[function sets]]
* [[image factorizations]]
* a set of [[natural numbers]]

Any [[well-pointed category|well-pointed]] [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]] [[coherent category]] with a [[natural numbers object]] inside of the set theory is thus an internal model of the set theory, and thus could be considered to be a [[universe]] inside of the set theory.

### In type theory

There are many different notions of propositional resizing in type theory. These include

* propositional resizing for individual universes

* propositional resizing for universe hierarchies

* propositional resizing for the entire dependent type theory, if the dependent type theory is defined via universes and universe levels. 

A [[universe hierarchy]] satisfies **propositional resizing** if it satisfies both [[local propositional resizing]] and [[global propositional resizing]]. The universe hierarchy is then said to be **impredicative**. 

Similarly, if the dependent type theory is defined via universes and universe levels, the dependent type theory satisfies **propositional resizing** if it satisfies both [[local propositional resizing]] and [[global propositional resizing]], and then the dependent type theory is then said to be **impredicative**. 

#### For individual universes
{#ForIndividualUniverses}

Let $(U, T)$ be a [[weakly Tarski universe]] and let
$$\sum_{A:U} \mathrm{isProp}(T(A))$$ 
be the type of all propositions in $U$. The weakly Tarski universe $(U, T)$ is **impredicative** or satisfies **propositional resizing** if it has a term $\Omega_U:U$ and an equivalence 
$$\mathrm{propresize}:T(\Omega_U) \simeq \sum_{A:U} \mathrm{isProp}(T(A))$$

A weakly Tarski universe is **strictly impredicative** or satisfies **strict propositional resizing** if the above equivalence becomes a [[definitional equality]]:

$$T(\Omega_U) \equiv \sum_{A:U} \mathrm{isProp}(T(A))$$

In particular, every impredicative [[strictly Tarski universe]] is strictly impredicative. 

## Properties

\begin{theorem}
Any [[universe of propositions]] satisfying [[propositional resizing]] is a [[contractible type]].
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Given a [[universe of propositions]] $\Omega$, the type of all propositions in $\Omega$ is $\Omega$ itself. Then [[propositional resizing]] says that $\Omega$ has an element $\Omega':\Omega$ such that its type reflection is $\Omega$ itself. This implies that $\Omega$ itself a [[mere proposition]] by definition of universe of proposiions, which implies that $\Omega$ is a contractible type by the element $\Omega':\Omega$ and the fact that for all other elements $P:\Omega$, $P = \Omega'$. 
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
Any [[universe of propositions]] $\Omega$ closed under the [[empty type]] does not satisfy [[propositional resizing]]. 
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Suppose that $\Omega$ is closed under the empty type $\emptyset$ represented in $\Omega$ by the element $\bot:\Omega$, and satisfies [[propositional resizing]]. Then one has that $\bot = \Omega'$ since $\Omega$ is a [[mere proposition]], and by transport one has $\emptyset \simeq \Omega$, but since $\Omega$ is contractible by propositional resizing, the empty type is also contractible, which is [[false]]. 
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
The [[universe of all propositions]] $\mathrm{Prop}$ does not satisfy [[propositional resizing]]. 
\end{theorem}
