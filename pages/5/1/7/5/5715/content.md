## Idea

The _configuration space_ of a [[physical system]] is the [[space]] of all possible configurations of the system. 

For example the configuration space of $n \in \mathbb{N}$ point particles that  roam around in some [[manifold]] $X$ (e.g. thought of as physical [[space]]) is the $n$-fold [[Cartesian product]] $X^n$. If the particles are constrained not to be at coincident points, then the configuration space is the corresponding [[subspace]] of $X^n$. This happens to be the kind of  [[configuration space (mathematics)|configuration space as typically considered in mathematics]] see at _[[Fadell's configuration space]]_. 

In [[field theory]] over [[Lorentzian manifolds|Lorentzian]] [[spacetime]] one is typically interested not in the configurations of fields "at a given time" (say on a fixed [[Cauchy surface]]) but in configuratios of fields on (an [[open subset]] of) [[spacetime]]. This is then called the _[[space of trajectories]]_ or _[[space of histories]]_ of the system.
