## Idea

For $G$ a [[group]] and $P$ a $G$-[[torsor]], $G$ is also called the *structure group* of $P$.

This usage is particularly common in the case that $G$ is a geometric [[group]] (e.g. a [[topological group]] or [[Lie group]]) and $P \to X$ a $G$-[[principal bundle]].

More generally, and less tautologically, if $V \to X$ is a $G$-[[associated bundle]] then one says that $V$ has *structure group* $G$. 

In particular when $V = T X$ is a [[tangent bundle]] with structure group $G$ one also says that $X$ is equipped with *[[G-structure]]*. 

In [[physics]], with these bundles understood as [[field bundles]] (cf. *[[fiber bundles in physics]]*) the structure group is called the local *[[gauge group]]*, but see there for disambiguation.
