## Disambiguation

The notion of a [[type]] [[variable]] in [[type theory]]. 

In one sense, any [[dependent type theory]] with a [[Russell universe]] $U$ has type variables that are simply variables of the universe $U$, by definition of a Russell universe. 

However, the term "type variable" is usually used for type variables that range over all types, in the sense of [[polymorphism|polymorphic]] type theory.

* [[System F]] is a [[polymorphic]] [[simple type theory]] with type variables.

* For type variables in [[polymorphic]] [[dependent type theories]] with a single separate [[type]] [[judgment]], see [[dependent type theory with type variables]]
