## Definition ##

Given a [[Heyting field]] $F$, let us define the type of all terms in $F$ apart from 0:

$$F_{#0} \coloneqq \{a \in F \vert a # 0\}$$

The **reciprocal function** is a [[partial function]] $f:F_{#0} \to F$ such that for all $a \in F_{#0}$, $a \cdot f(a) = 1$ and $f(a) \cdot a = 1$
