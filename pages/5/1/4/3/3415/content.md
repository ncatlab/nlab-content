## Idea

A [[quasi-category]] is a [[simplicial set]] satisfying [[weak Kan complex|weak Kan filler conditions]] that make it behave like the [[nerve]] of an [[(∞,1)-category]]. 

There is a [[model category]] structure on the category [[SSet]] --  the **[[Andre Joyal|Joyal]] model structure** or **model structure for quasi-categories** -- such that the fibrant objects are precisely the quasi-categories and the weak equivalences precisely the correct _categorical equivalences_ that generalize the notion of [[equivalence of categories]].

## Definition

\begin{definition}\label{TheModelStructure}

The **model structure for quasi-categories** or **Joyal model structure** $sSet_{Joyal}$ on [[sSet]] has

* [[cofibrations]] are the [[monomorphisms]],

* [[weak equivalences]] are those maps that are taken by the [[rigidification of quasi-categories|rigidification]] functor $\mathfrak{C}$ (the [[left adjoint]] to the [[homotopy coherent nerve]]) to a [[Dwyer-Kan equivalence]] (a [[weak equivalence]] in the [[Dwyer-Kan-Bergner model structure on sSet-enriched categories]]).

\end{definition}


## Properties

### As a Cisinski model structure

The model structure for quasi-categories is the [[Cisinski model structure]] on [[sSet]] whose class of weak equivalences is the localizer generated by the [[spine]] inclusions $\{Sp^n \hookrightarrow \Delta^n\}$. See ([Ara](#Ara)).

### General properties

###### Proposition

The model structure for quasi-categories is

* a [[left proper model category]],

* a [[combinatorial model category]].

=--

\begin{lemma}
\label{CartesianProductPreservesWeakCategoricalEquivalences}
  The image under the [[Cartesian product]]-functor of two [[weak categorical equivalences]] (Def. \ref{TheModelStructure}) is again a weak categorical equivalence.
\end{lemma}

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

The model structure for quasi-categories is a [[monoidal model category]] with respect to [[cartesian product]] and thus is naturally an [[enriched model category]] over itself, hence is $sSet_{Joyal}$-enriched (reflecting the fact that it tends to present an [[(infinity,2)-category]]). It is however _not_ $sSet_{Quillen}$-enriched and thus not a "[[simplicial model category]]" with respect to this enrichment.

###### Proposition

For $p \colon \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ a morphism of [[simplicial sets]] such that $\mathcal{D}$ is a [[quasi-category]]. Then $p$ is a fibration in $sSet_{Joyal}$ precisely if both of the following conditions hold:

1. it is an *[[inner fibration]]*;

1. it is an *[[isofibration]]*: 

   in that for every [[equivalence in an (∞,1)-category|equivalence]] in $\mathcal{D}$ and a lift of its [[domain]] through $p$, there is also a lift of the whole equivalence through $p$ to an equivalence in $\mathcal{C}$.

=--

This is due to [[Joyal]]. &lbrack;[Lurie (2009), cor. 2.4.6.5](#Lurie09)&rbrack;

So every [[fibration]] in $sSet_{Joyal}$ is an [[inner fibration]], but the converse is in general false. A notable exception are the fibrations to the point:

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The [[fibrant objects]] in $sSet_{Joyal}$ are precisely those that are [[inner fibration|inner fibrant]] over the point, hence those simplicial sets which are [[quasi-categories]].

### Relation to the model structure for $\infty$-groupoids {#RelToInfGrpds}

The inclusion of [[(∞,1)-category|(∞,1)-categories]] [[∞Grpd]] $\stackrel{i}{\hookrightarrow}$ [[(∞,1)Cat]] has a left and a right [[adjoint (∞,1)-functor]]

$$
  (grpdfy \dashv i \dashv Core)
  \;\;
  \colon
  \;\;
  (\infty,1)Cat
  \stackrel{\overset{grpdfy}{\longrightarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{i}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{Core}{\longrightarrow}}}  
  \infty Grpd
  \,,
$$

where

* $Core$ is the operation of taking the [[core]], the maximal $\infty$-groupoid inside an $(\infty,1)$-category;

* $grpdfy$ is the operation of _groupoidification_ that freely generates an $\infty$-groupoid on a given $(\infty,1)$-category

(see [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, around remark 1.2.5.4]])

The adjunction $(grpdfy \dashv i)$ is modeled by the [[Bousfield localization of model categories|left Bousfield localization]]

\[
  \label{BousfieldLocalizationToKanQuillenStructure}
  sSet_{Quillen}
  \underoverset
    {\underset{Id}{\longrightarrow}}
    {\overset{Id}{\longleftarrow}}
    {\;\; \bot \;\;}
  sSet_{Joyal} 
  \,.
\]

Notice that the left [[derived functor]] $\mathbb{L} Id \colon (sSet_{Joyal})^\circ \to (sSet_{Quillen})^\circ$ takes a fibrant object on the left -- a [[quasi-category]] -- then does nothing to it but regarding it now as an object in $sSet_{Quillen}$ and then producing its fibrant replacement there, which is [[Kan fibrant replacement]]. This is indeed the operation of _groupoidification_ .

The other adjunction is given by the following

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

There is a [[Quillen adjunction]]

$$
  (k_! \dashv k^!) 
  \;\; \colon 
  sSet_{Quillen}
  \stackrel
    {\overset{k^!}{\longleftarrow}}
    {\underset{k_!}{\longrightarrow}}
   sSet_{Joyal}
$$

which arises as [[nerve and realization]] for the [[cosimplicial object]]

$$
  k : \Delta \to sSet : [n] \mapsto \Delta'[n]
  \,,
$$

where $\Delta^'[n] = N(\{0 \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} 1 \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} \cdots \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} n\})$ is the [[nerve]] of the [[groupoid]] freely generated from the linear [[quiver]] $[n]$.

This means that for $X \in SSet$ we have

* $k^!(X)_n  = Hom_{sSet}(\Delta'[n],X)$.

* and $k_!(X)_n = \int^{[k]} X_k \cdot \Delta'[k]$.

=--

This is ([Joyal & Tierney (2007), prop 1.19](#JoyalTierney07))

The following proposition shows that $(k_! \dashv k^!)$ is indeed a model for $(i \dashv Core)$:

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

* For any $X \in sSet$ the canonical morphism $X \to k_!(X)$ is an acyclic cofibration in $sSet_{Quillen}$;

* for $X \in sSet$ a [[quasi-category]], the canonical morphism $k^!(X) \to Core(X)$ is an acyclic fibration in $sSet_{Quillen}$.

=--

This is ([Joyal & Tierney (2007), prop 1.20](#JoyalTierney07))

## History

[[André Joyal]] on the history of the Joyal model structure (also on [MathOverflow](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/425082/when-did-the-joyal-model-structure-on-simplicial-sets-originate/427514#427514)):

> I became interested in quasi-categories (without the name) around 1980 after attending a talk by Jon Beck on the work of Boardman and Vogt. I wondered if category theory could be extended to quasi-categories. In my mind, a crucial test was to show that a quasi-category is a Kan complex if its homotopy category is a groupoid. All my attempts at showing this have failed for about 15 years, until I stopped trying hard! I found a proof after extending to quasi-categories a few basic notions of category theory. This was around 1995. The model structure for quasi-categories was discovered soon after. I did not publish it immediately because I wanted to show that it could be used for proving something new in homotopy theory. I am a bit of a perfectionist (and overly ambitious?). I was hoping to develop a synthesis between category theory and homotopy theory (hence the name quasi-categories). I met Lurie at a conference organised by Carlos Simpson in Nice (in 2001?). I gave a talk on the model structure and Lurie asked for a copy of my notes afterward.
