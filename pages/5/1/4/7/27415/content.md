## Definition

### In logic

Two [[propositions]] $P$ and $Q$ are said to be **mutually exclusive** or to have **mutual exclusivity** if $\neg (P \wedge Q)$ holds. 

By [[currying]], both $P \Rightarrow \neg Q$ and $Q \Rightarrow \neg P$ hold. $P$ is **affirmative** and $Q$ is **refutative** if the [[implication]] $Q \Rightarrow \neg P$ is a [[logical equivalence]] $Q \iff \neg P$. Conversely, $P$ is **refutative** and $Q$ is **affirmative** if the [[implication]] $P \Rightarrow \neg Q$ is a [[logical equivalence]] $P \iff \neg Q$. $P$ and $Q$ are both **[[stable proposition|stable]]** if they are both affirmative and refutative. $P$ and $Q$ are **[[decidable propositions|decidable]]** if $P \vee Q$ holds. 

### In probability

Two [[events]] $P$ and $Q$ on a [[probability space]] $A$ are said to be **mutually exclusive** or to have **mutual exclusivity** if $P \cap Q = \emptyset$.
