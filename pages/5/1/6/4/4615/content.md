## Definition

A _simplicial topological space_ is a [[simplicial object]] in [[Top]].

Often this is called just a _simplicial space_ , if the context is clear. 

A special case is that of [[simplicial manifold]]s.

Often one is interested in simplicial topological spaces with extra nice properties. See [[nice simplicial topological space]] for more on that.


## Applications

As with simplicial objects in general, simplicial spaces may serve to model [[internal âˆž-groupoid]]s in [[Top]]. Notably there is a rich theory of [[simplicial topological group]]s.
