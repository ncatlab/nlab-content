## Idea

In [[formal logic]] and [[computer science]], by an *abstract syntax tree* one means a labelled [[tree]] whose nodes represent *expressions* of a [[formal language]], such as as [[programming language]], and whose edges indicate sub-expressions, meant to reflect the "abstract" [[syntax]] of the language, in contrast to the "concrete syntax" given by linear [[string (computer science)|strings]] of characters.

## Related concepts
