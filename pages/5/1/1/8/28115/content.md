 Baumslag--Solitar group $BS(m,n)$ for $m,n\neq 0$ is usually defined via its presentation

$$ 
BS(m,n) = \langle x,y \mid x^{-1} y^m x = y^n \rangle
$$ 

This series of groups appears often in [[combinatorial group theory]] and geometric group theory.
The simplest case $BS(1,1)$ is clearly isomorphic to
$\mathbf{Z}\times\mathbf{Z}$.
