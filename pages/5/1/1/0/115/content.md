Given [[object|objects]] $x$ and $y$ in a [[category]], the homset $hom(x,y)$ is the collection of all morphisms from $x$ to $y$.  

#Remarks#

* We say a category is [[locally small category|locally small]] if this collection is always actually a set instead of a proper class.  This holds for many examples, but not for all. For example, if $C$ and $D$ are not [[small category|small categories]], then the [[functor category]] $C^D$ (whose objects are [[natural transformation]]s) will not be locally small.

* For a category [[enriched category theory|enriched over]] a category $V$, the "homset" is an object of $V$, the _hom-object_.
