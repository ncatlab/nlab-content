Given [[object]]s $x$ and $y$ in a [[category]], the homset $hom(x,y)$ is the collection of all morphisms from $x$ to $y$.  

We say a category is [[locally small]] if this collection is always actually a set instead of a proper class.  This holds for many examples, but not (for example) for the category [[Cat]] whose objects are [[small]] categories and whose morphisms are [[functors]].
