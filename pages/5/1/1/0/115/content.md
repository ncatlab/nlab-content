Given [[object|objects]] $x$ and $y$ in a [[category]], the homset $hom(x,y)$ is the collection of all morphisms from $x$ to $y$.  

#Remarks#

* We say a category is [[locally small category|locally small]] if this collection is always actually a set instead of a proper class.  This holds for many examples, but not (for example) for the category [[Cat]] whose objects are [[small category|small categories]] and whose morphisms are [[functor|functors]].

* For a category [[enriched category theory|enriched over]] a category $V$, the "homset" is an object of $V$, the _hom-object_.
