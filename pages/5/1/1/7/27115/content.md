## Idea

A **$\sigma$-complete Boolean algebra** is a [[Boolean algebra]] which is also a [[sigma-complete lattice|$\sigma$-complete lattice]]; that is, it is a [[poset]] with [[countable set|countable]] [[limits]] and [[colimits]] that is also [[cartesian closed]] and satisfies the [[law of excluded middle]]. 

## Examples

* Assuming [[excluded middle]], the [[set of truth values]] is a $\sigma$-complete Boolean algebra. 

* Assuming the [[limited principle of omniscience]], the [[boolean domain]] is a $\sigma$-complete Boolean algebra. 

* Assuming [[excluded middle]], any [[sigma-algebras|$\sigma$-algebra]] on a [[set]] $X$ is a $\sigma$-complete Boolean algebra.
