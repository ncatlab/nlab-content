## Definition


Under a _pointed $(\infty,1)$-category_ is often understood an [[(∞,1)-category]] that admits a [[zero object]], i.e. an [[object]] which is both [[initial object in an (∞,1)-category|initial]] and [[terminal object in an (∞,1)-category|terminal]] (this then is unique up to [[equivalence in an (∞,1)-category|equivalence]]). 

The terminology "pointed $(\infty,1)$-category", in this sense, is commonly used, for instance, when speaking about [[stable (∞,1)-categories]], which are such pointed $(\infty,1)$-categories with further properties.

If a pointed $(\infty,1)$-category in this sense happens to be just a [[1-category]], then it is a _[[pointed category]]_. 

The same terminological caveat applies as applies to "[[pointed categories]]":

More generally, a _pointed (∞,1)-category_ could be taken to be a [[pointed object]] in [[(∞,1)Categories]], i.e. an [[(∞,1)-category]] with _any_ of its [[objects]] singled out, and with [[(∞,1)-functors]] between such pointed $(\infty,1)$-categories required to preserved these chosen objects.
