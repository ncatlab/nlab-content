A __commutative $k$-algebra__ is an [[associative unital algebra|associative unital $k$-algebra]] with commutative multiplication. There is a generalization of commutativity when applied to [[finitary monad]]s in $Set$, that is [[generalized rings]], as studied in [[Nikolai Durov|Durov's]] thesis.

__The commutative algebra__ is the subject studying commutative algebras. It is closely related and it is the main algebraic foundation of the [[algebraic geometry]]. Some of the well-known classical theorems of the commutative algebra are the [[Hilbert basis theorem]] and _Nullstellensatz_, as well as many results pertaining to syzygies, resultants and discriminants.
