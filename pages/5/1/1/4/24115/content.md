## Idea

The notion of a *quotient object coclassifier* in a [[finitely cocomplete category]] is [[abstract duality|dual]] to that of a *[[subobject classifier]]* in a [[finitely complete category]]. 

##Â Definition

In a category $C$ with [[finite colimits]], a quotient object coclassifier is an object $Q$ with an [[epimorphism]] $\epsilon:Q \to \mathbb{0}$ into the [[initial object]] $\mathbb{0}$, such that for every [[epimorphism]] $f:X \to U$ there is a unique morphism $\digamma_U:Q \to X$ such that there is a [[pushout]] [[diagram]] of the form


$$
  \array{
    Q 
      &\overset{\epsilon}{\longrightarrow}& 
    \mathbb{0}   
    \\
    \big\downarrow {}^{\mathrlap{\digamma_U}} 
    && 
    \big\downarrow {}^{\mathrlap{\exists !}}
    \\
    X &\underset{f}{\longrightarrow}& U
  }
  \,.
$$
