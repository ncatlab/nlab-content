## Definition

A [[topological space]] $X$ is called __irreducible__ if it can not be expressed as [[union]] of two proper [[closed subsets]], or equivalently if any two [[inhabited set|inhabited]] [[open subsets]] have inhabited intersection. 

A subset $S$ of a topological space $X$ is an __irreducible subset__ if $S$ is an irreducible topological space with the [[subspace topology]]. 

An [[algebraic variety]] is irreducible if its underlying topological space (in the [[Zariski topology]]) is irreducible.

A _[[sober topological space]]_, is one whose only irreducible closed subsets are the [[closures]] of single points.
