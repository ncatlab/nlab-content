A subset $S$ of a [[topological space]] $X$ is an __irreducible subset__ if it can not be expressed as union of two proper closed subsets, or equivalently if any two inhabited open subsets have inhabited intersection. An __irreducible topological space__ is a topological space which is an irreducible subset of itself. An [[algebraic variety]] is irreducible if its underlying topological space (in the [[Zariski topology]]) is irreducible.

Contrast this with a [[sober space]], where the only irreducible closed subsets are the points.
