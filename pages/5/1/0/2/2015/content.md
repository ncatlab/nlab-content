## Definition

A [[topological space]] $X$ is called __irreducible__ if it cannot be expressed as a finite [[union]] of proper [[closed subsets]], or equivalently if any finite collection of [[inhabited set|inhabited]] [[open subsets]] has inhabited intersection.

In particular, this implies that:

* $X$ cannot be expressed as the [[union]] of two proper [[closed subsets]]. Equivalently, any two [[inhabited set|inhabited]] [[open subsets]] have inhabited intersection.

* $X$ cannot be expressed as the [[union]] of the empty collection of proper [[closed subsets]], which implies that $X$ must be [[inhabited set|inhabited]]. Equivalently, the intersection of the empty collection of [[inhabited set|inhabited]] [[open subsets]] has inhabited intersection, which means exactly that $X$ is inhabited.

A subset $S$ of a topological space $X$ is an __irreducible subset__ if $S$ is an irreducible topological space with the [[subspace topology]].

An [[algebraic variety]] is irreducible if its underlying topological space (in the [[Zariski topology]]) is irreducible.

A _[[sober topological space]]_, is one whose only irreducible closed subsets are the [[closures]] of single points.
