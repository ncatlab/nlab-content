### Abstract

> A significant fraction of dialectical philosophy can be modeled mathematically through the use of "[[adjoint cylinder|cylinders]]" (diagrams of shape $\Delta_1$) in a category, wherein the two identical [[subobjects]] (united by the third map in the diagram) are "opposite". In a [[bicategory]], oppositeness can be very effectively characterized in terms of [[adjunction|adjointness]], but even in an ordinary category it may sometimes be given a useful definition. For example, an effective basis for teaching calculus is a ringed category satisfying the Hadamard-Marx property. The description in engineering mechanics of continuous bodies that can undergo cracking is clarified by an example involving lattices, raising a new questions about the foundations of topology. 

> ($\Delta_1$ is the category of order-preserving maps between totally-ordered sets of one and two elements, respectively.)
