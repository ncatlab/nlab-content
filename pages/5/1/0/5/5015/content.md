## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn #PlainDefinition}
###### Definition

A [[topological groupoid]] or [[Lie groupoid]] $C$ is called an **&#233;tale groupoid** if the [[domain|source]]-map $s : Mor C \to Obj C$ is a [[local homeomorphism]] or [[local diffeomorphism]], respectively, and hence exhibits the space of morphisms as an [[étale space]] over the space of objects.

###### Remark

In the situation of def. \ref{PlainDefinition} it follows that all the other structure maps ([[codomain|target]], [[identity]], [[composition]]) are also local homeomorphisms, resp. local diffeomorphisms.

This means that an &#233;tale groupoid is equivakentlly [[internal groupoid]] in the [[category]] whose objects are [[topological spaces]]/[[smooth manifold]]s and whose [[morphisms]] are local homeomorphisms/diffeomorphisms.

###### Remark

Definition \ref{PlainDefinition} is not invariant under the general notion of [[equivalence]] of Lie groupoids, the equivalence between them regarded as [[smooth groupoids]], specifically as [[differentiable stacks]] ("[[Morita equivalence]]"). 

But it does make sense to take an **&#233;tale smooth groupoid** to be a [[smooth groupoid]]/[[differentiable stack]] which is equivalent, as such, to, hence is presented by an &#233;tale Lie groupoid as in def. \ref{PlainDefinition}. 
This notion has been called **folitation groupoid** in ([Crainic-Moerdijk 00](#CrainicMoerdijk)).

The following characterizes foliation groupoids

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

For a [[Lie groupoid]] $\mathcal{G}_\bullet$ the following are equivalent

1. $\mathcal{G}$ is a foliation groupoid, hence is equivalent, as a [[differentiable stack]] to an &#233;tale groupoid as in def. \ref{PlainDefinition};

1. The [[Lie algebroid]] $(\mathfrak{g},\mathcal{G}_0)$ which corresponds to $\mathcal{G}$ under [[Lie differentiation]] has an [[injection|injective]] [[anchor map]];

   hence the [[orbits]] of $\mathcal{G}$ form the [[leaves]] of a [[foliation]], the foliation whose leaves are tangent to the vectors in the image of this anchor map;

1. All [[isotropy groups]] of $\mathcal{G}_\bullet$ are [[discrete groups]].

This is ([Crainic-Moerdijk 00, theorem 1](#CrainicMoerdijk)).

## Properties

### Cohomology and homology

In the literature one finds, roughly speaking, two different approaches to the study of &#233;tale groupoids. One approach is based on the construction of the convolution algebras associated to an &#233;tale groupoid, in the spirit of Connes' [[noncommutative geometry]], and involves the study of [[cyclic homology|cyclic]] and [[Hochschild homology]] and [[Hochschild cohomology|cohomology]] of these algebras. The other approach uses methods of algebraic topology such as the construction of the [[classifying space]] of an
&#233;tale groupoid and its [[abelian sheaf cohomology|(sheaf) cohomology groups]].

### Characterization by convolution Hopf algebroids (Gelfand duality)
 {#GelfandDuality}

The [[groupoid convolution algebra]] $C^\ast(\mathcal{G}_\bullet)$ of a [[Lie groupoid]] with its canonical [[atlas]] remembered has the structure of a [[Hopf algebroid]]. 
In ([Mr&#269;un 99](#Mrcun99), [Kali&#353;nik-Mr&#269;un 07](#KalisnikMrcun07)) &#233;tale Lie groupoids are characterized dually by their Hopf algebroids  (a refinement of [[Gelfand duality]] to [[noncommutative topology]]).



## Examples

&#201;tale groupoids arise naturally as models for [[leaf spaces]] of [[foliations]], for [[orbifold]]s, and for [[orbit spaces]] of [[discrete group]] [[actions]].


* Every [[topological space]] may be regarded as an &#233;tale groupoid with only identity morphisms.

* For $X$ a [[topological space]] and $\Gamma$ a [[discrete group]] with a continuous [[action]] $X \times \Gamma \to X$ on $X$, the [[action groupoid]] $X//\Gamma$ is &#233;tale.

* The [[Haefliger groupoid]] $\Gamma^q$ has the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^q$ as its space of objects. A [[morphism]] $x \to y$ is a [[germ]] of a [[diffeomorphism]] $(\mathbb{R}^q,x) \to (\mathbb{R}^q, y)$.

  This groupoid, and its [[geometric realization]] play a central role in [[foliation theory]].

* Every [[orbifold]] is an &#233;tale [[Lie groupoid]].
