## Idea

A notion of _[[equality]]_ in [[type theory]] involving the notion of _[[judgement]]_. In [[Martin-LÃ¶f type theory]] and [[cubical type theory]], judgmental equality is used for [[definitional equality]]. Judgmental equality can be contrasted with [[propositional equality]], where equality is a [[proposition]], and [[typal equality]], where equality is a [[type]].
