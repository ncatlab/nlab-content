# Idea #

_Synthetic differential supergeometry_ pairs the concepts of

* [[synthetic differential geometry]]

with those of

* [[supergeometry - contents|supergeometry]].


# References #

Proposals for the theory have been presented in

Not much more literature than that seems to exist at the moment.
