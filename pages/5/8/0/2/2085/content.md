At first, [[homotopy theory]] has been restricted to topological spaces, while [[homological algebra]] worked in a varity of (mainly algebraic) examples. Whitehead proposed around 1949 the subject of algebraic homotopy theory, to deal with classical homotopy theory of spaces via algebraic models. This idea did not extend to do homotopy methods in general setups of course, but had a concrete modelling and calculations for topological spaces in mind. In 1960-s Grothendieck introduced fundamental group and cohomology in the setup of [[topos|topoi]] which were a wider and more modern setup. In retrospective he considered exactness axioms which he introduced in [[Tohoku]] in a context of homological algebra to be conceptually kind of reasoning bringing to understanding general spaces, a la topoi. Quillen in late 1960-s introduced an axiomatics (of [[model category]]) on a category to be able to do great deal of homotopy theory; this is a first instance of many abstract machineries which have a common name homotopical algebra; and [[rational homotopy theory]] was its first success. A large part (but maybe not all) of homological algebra can be subsumed as the [[derived functor]]s make sense in model categories, and at least the categories of chain complexes can be treated via Quillen model structures. 

Nowdays, there are lots of new formalisms (derivators, homotopical categories...) of homotopical algebra and very many examples ([[simplicial sets]], [[cubical sets]], [[crossed complexes]], strict infinity categories, $\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy theory, homotopy theory for operator algebras, dg-Lie algebras, dg-operads...). Strong impetus has been given by Grothendieck's program in [[Pursuing stacks]] and work (of Bangor school, A. Joyal, C. Simpson and his school, R. Jardine, C. Rezk, C. Cisinski, J. Lurie...) which followed them; in that program [[homotopy types]] are related to higher [[stacks]]; thus the natural setup is realized to be of $\infty$-categories. For simplicity, $(\infty,1)$-categories (usually modeled by [[quasicategories]], [[Segal categories]], simplicially enriched categories etc.) were understood first and by now systematically, cf. [[Higher Topos Theory]]. This modern language is, unlike more axiomatic presentations on 1-categories with structure like Quillen model categories, more rarely referred to as homotopical algebra. 

$n$lab entry [[homotopy theory]] is taking homotopy in rather general sense including not only classical homotopy, but also algebraic homotopy, homotopical algebra in narrow sense (model categories and variants) and $(\infty,1)$-categories.
