#The Idea#

Just as we can convolve [[function|functions]] $f : M \to \mathbb{C}$ where $M$ is a [[group]], or more generally a [[monoid]], we can convolve [[functor|functors]] $f: M \to Set$ where $M$ is a [[monoidal category]].  So, for any monoidal category $M$, the [[functor category]] $Set^M$ becomes a monoidal category in its own right.  The tensor product in $Set^M$ is called **Day convolution**, named after Brian Day.

We can generalize this idea by replacing [[Set]] with a more general [[cocomplete category|cocomplete]] [[symmetric monoidal category]].

#Definition#

The definition is left as an exercise for future readers of this page.
