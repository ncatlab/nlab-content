## Idea

The theory of _special relativity_ describes dynamics in [[physics|physical]] [[spacetime]] in absence of a field of [[gravity]].

Specifically, it models

* [[spacetime]] as a flat time-oriented [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]: 
  [[Minkowski space]];

* trajectories of  point particles as timelike curves in Minkowski space.

* the [[electromagnetic field]] as a closed 2-[[differential form|form]] on Minkowski space.

* the [[force]] exerted by the electromagnetic field on a charged particle as the contraction of that 2-form with the tangent vector of the trajectory of the particle. 

If instead of restricting to Minkowski space spacetime is allowed to be an arbitrary [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]] one speaks of the resulting framework as the theory of [[general relativity]].
