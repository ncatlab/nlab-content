if gravitons exist, they are massless and therefore travel with the speed of light.
If it is possible for photons to get "trapped" inside a black hole once they've passed the event horizon, why does one still "feel" the gravitational effects of a black hole as gravitons should also get "trapped".
Because one does "feel" these effects, gravitons are apparently capable of traveling from the inside out through the event horizon.
The only difference here is spin.
A photon has spin 1, a graviton should have spin 2.
What can one conclude here?
