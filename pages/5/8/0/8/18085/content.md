# Relative pseudomonads

## Idea

A relative pseudomonad generalizes a [[pseudomonad]] relative to a 2-functor.  This enables the construction of Kleisli bicategories of pseudomonads on $Prof$ (e.g. for defining [[generalized multicategories]]) by means of "pseudo-distributive laws" as if the [[presheaf category]] construction were a monad with [[Prof]] as its Kleisli bicategory, even though it is not for size reasons.
