## Idea

The _Siegel upper half space_ is the generalization of the [[upper half-plane]] as one passes from the description of complex [[elliptic curves]] to that of [[Riemann surfaces]] of higher [[genus]].

## Definition

The _Siegel upper half space of degree $g$ (or genus $g$)_ is the set of $g\times g$ [[symmetric matrices]] whose entries are complex numbers with positive-definite imaginary part.

## Relation to the Symplectic Group

The Siegel upper half space of degree $g$ may be obtained as the quotient $\mathcal{H}_{g}=\Sp_{2g}(\mathbb{R})/\U(g)$ of the [[symplectic group]] $\Sp_{2g}(\mathbb{R})$ by its maximal compact subgroup (and the stabilizer of $i\cdot\mathbb{1}_{g}$), the [[unitary group]] $\U(g)$, embedded into $\Sp_{2g}(\mathbb{R})$ as follows:

$$\U(g)=\lbrace \begin{pmatrix} A & B \\ -B & A\end{pmatrix}\in\Sp_{2g}(\mathbb{R}):A\cdot A^{t}+B\cdot B^{t}=\mathbb{1}_{g}\rbrace.$$
