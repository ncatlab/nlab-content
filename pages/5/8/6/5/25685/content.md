## Definition

\begin{definition}
Given a [[polynomial function]] with [[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]] [[coefficients]] $x \mapsto f(x)$, a **simple root** is a [[root]] of $x \mapsto f(x)$ such that the [[derivative]] of $x \mapsto f(x)$ evaluated at the root is [[invertible]]. 
\end{definition}

More generally, let $R$ be a [[commutative ring]]. The [[polynomial ring]] $R[x]$ is a [[differential algebra]] and thus has a derivative function $(-)':R[x] \to R[x]$. There is a canonical ring homomorphism $h:R[x] \to (R \to R)$ from the [[polynomial ring]] $R[x]$ to the [[function algebra]] $R \to R$ which assigns constant polynomials to [[constant functions]] in $R$ and the bare indeterminant to the [[identity function]] of $R$, which when [[uncurried]] leads to the evaluation of polynomials $(-)((-)):R[x] \times R \to R$. Since the set of polynomial functions in a commutative ring is a polynomial ring generated by the identity function, the situation for [[polynomial functions]] is simply a special case of the situation for polynomials. Thus, we have the following definition for general polynomials over [[fields]]:

\begin{definition}
Given a [[Heyting field]] $K$ and a [[polynomial]] $f \in K[x]$ with [[coefficients]] in $K$, a **simple root** is a [[root]] $a \in K$ of $f$ such that $f'(a)$, the evaluation of the [[derivative]] of $f$ at $a$, is [[invertible]].
\end{definition}

In classical mathematics (implying acceptance of the law of excluded middle), a simple root $a$ is a root that is not a multiple root: it is not the case that $(x-a)^2$ divides $f(x)$, or "not $f'(a) = 0$". But for the purposes of constructive mathematics, it is preferable to state the condition as "$f'(a)$ is [[apartness|apart]] from $0$", or that $f'(a)$ is invertible. Hence the definitions above.
