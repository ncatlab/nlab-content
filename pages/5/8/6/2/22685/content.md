## Definition

An __absorption magma__ or __annihilation magma__ is a [[magma]] $(M,\cdot)$ with an element $0\in M$ satisfying the absorption/annihilation axioms: for all $a \in M$, $0 \cdot a = 0$ and $a \cdot 0 = 0$. 

## Properties

### Zero divisors

A non-zero element $a \in M$ is a __[[zero divisor]]__ if thete exists a non-zero element $b \in M$ such that $a \cdot b = 0$ or $b \cdot a = 0$. 

### Integral magmas

An absorption magma whose largest submagma not containing $0$ is a [[cancellative magma]] is called an __integral magma__. 

### Division magma

An integral magma $M$ such that for all non-zero elements $a, b \in M$ there exist elements $c,d \in M$ such that $a \cdot c = b$ and $d \cdot a = b$ is called a __division magma__. Equivalently, a  division magma is an absorption magma whose largest submagma not containing $0$ is a [[quasigroup]]. 

## Examples

* [[absorption monoids]]

* Every [[magma object]] in the category of [[unital magmas]] is an absorption magma. Particular examples of this include the multiplicative monoid in a rig (monoid objects in [[CMon]]) or a ring (monoid objects in [[Ab]]. 

* The multiplicative magma of the [[octonions]] is an absorption magma (and a division magma).
