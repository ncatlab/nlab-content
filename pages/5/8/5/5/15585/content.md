
This page is about [[William Lawvere]]'s Ph.D. thesis:

* F. W. Lawvere, _Functorial Semantics of Algebraic Theories_, Ph.D. thesis, Columbia University, 1963.

Written under [[S. Eilenberg]] and highly influential, the dissertation was not published at the time, and only two short notices appeared:

* F. W. Lawvere, _Functorial Semantics of Algebraic Theories_, Proc. Nat.  Acad. Sci. **50** (1963) pp. 869--872. ([pdf](http://www.pnas.org/content/50/5/869.full.pdf))

* F. W. Lawvere, _Algebraic theories, algebraic categories, and algebraic functors_, pp. 413--418 in Addison, Henkin, Tarski (eds.), _The Theory of Models_, North-Holland Amsterdam 1965.

It was finally published together with an author's comment and a supplement here:

* Reprints in Theory and Applications of Categories, No. 5 (2004) pp. 1--121 ([tac](http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/5/tr5abs.html)).

In his thesis, Lawvere introduces [[Lawvere theories]] and the [[categorical semantics|functorial perspective]] into model theory. He takes steps towards axiomatizing [[ETCC|the category of categories as a foundation for mathematics]]. This  includes introducing the notion of [[comma category]] as an auxiliary to a definition of [[adjoint functors|adjunction]] implicitly involving an isomorphism of [[2-sided discrete fibrations]] (cf. Lawvere 2004 pp.12--13).

Generalization to partial algebraic theories:

* [[Ivan Di Liberti]], [[Fosco Loregian]], [[Pawel Sobocinski]], [[Chad Nester]] _Functorial semantics for partial theories_, ([arXiv:2011.06644](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06644))
