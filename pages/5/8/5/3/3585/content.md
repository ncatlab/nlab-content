The theory of hyperfunctions, created by Japanese school (Sato, [[Kashiwara]] etc.) is one of the many variants of the theory of generalized functions. Unlike the earlier theory of distributions of Schwarz et al. it is not based on duals of some spaces of smooth functions but rather on boundary values of holomorphic functions. This allows usage of sheaf theory as well as a more general examples covered. For example in Schwarz's theory apart from measures one has functions with dicrete suports which are linear combinations of finite derivatives of delta functions. Here one can allow things like the exponential of a differential operator applied at a delta function. So in a sense one has distributions of infinite order. 

Hyperfunctions are very useful tool in the study of D-modules, holonomic systems of differential equations, and especially some aspects of [[symplectic geometry]] and [[harmonic analysis]] usually called [[microlocal analysis]].
