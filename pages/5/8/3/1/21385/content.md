## Relation to category theory

Although, in the context of [[computer science]], [[category theory]] is perhaps most often associated with [[functional programming]], there has been work on analysing object-oriented programming from a category-theoretic viewpoint, e.g. in the work of [[Bart Jacobs]] (e.g [Jacobs 2003](#Jacobs2003)).
