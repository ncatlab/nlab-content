## Idea

A **setoid** is a [[set]] equipped with a [[pseudo-equivalence relation]]. In the same way that [[magmoids]] are the raw structure used to build [[semicategories]] and [[pseudo-prosets]] are the raw structure used to build [[categories]], setoids are the raw structure used to build [[dagger categories]] and [[groupoids]] (i.e. a groupoid without associativity, unital laws, and inverse laws). Setoids are also sometimes used in "impoverished" [[foundations of mathematics]] that lack a primitive notion of [[quotient set]]; see for instance [[Bishop set]].

## Note on terminology

Sometimes, the term "setoid" is used in the mathematics literature for a set equipped with an [[equivalence relation]], rather than a set equipped with a pseudo-equivalence relation. However, in the nLab we shall by default take setoids as those sets equipped with a pseudo-equivalence relation, which is required for the category $Setoid$ to be the [[ex/lex completion]] of $Set$. 

## Definition

### With a set and a family of sets

Using graph theoretic terminology, a **setoid** is a loop [[directed pseudograph]], a [[set]] $V$ of **vertices** with a family of sets $E(a, b)$ of **edges** for each vertex $a \in A$ and $b \in A$, which comes with the following additional structure 

* for each vertex $a \in A$ a family of edges 
$$\mathrm{refl}(a) \in E(a, a)$$ 

* for each vertex $a \in A$ and $b \in A$ a family of functions
$$\mathrm{sym}(a, b):E(a, b) \to E(b, a)$$

* for each vertex $a \in A$, $b \in A$, and $c \in A$, a family of functions
$$\mathrm{trans}(a, b, c):(E(a, b) \times E(b, c)) \to E(a, c)$$

The edge family $(E, \mathrm{refl}, \mathrm{sym}, \mathrm{trans})$ is called a **pseudo-equivalence relation**. 

### With two sets

A **setoid** is a [[set]] $V$ with a set $E$ and functions $s:E \to V$, $t:E \to V$ (a loop [[directed pseudograph]]), with with functions $\mathrm{refl}:V \to E$, $\mathrm{sym}:E \to E$, and  
$$\mathrm{trans}:\{(f,g) \in E \times E \vert t(f) =_V s(g)\} \to E$$ 
such that 

* for every $a \in V$, $s(\mathrm{refl}(a)) =_E a$
* for every $a \in V$, $t(\mathrm{refl}(a)) =_E a$
* for every $f \in E$, $s(f) =_V t(\mathrm{sym}(f))$
* for every $f \in E$, $t(f) =_V s(\mathrm{sym}(f))$
* for every $f \in E$ and $g \in E$ such that $t(f) =_V s(g)$, $s(\mathrm{trans}(f,g)) =_E s(f)$ 
* for every $f \in E$ and $g \in E$ such that $t(f) =_V s(g)$, $t(\mathrm{trans}(f,g)) =_E t(g)$

The structure $(E, s, t, \mathrm{refl}, \mathrm{sym}, \mathrm{trans})$ is called a **pseudo-equivalence relation**. 

### Extensional functions, dagger functors, and isomorphisms

We define an **[[extensional function]]** $f:A \to B$ between two setoids $A = (V_A, E_A, \mathrm{refl}_A, \mathrm{sym}_A, \mathrm{trans}_A)$ and $B = (V_B, E_B, \mathrm{refl}_B, \mathrm{sym}_B, \mathrm{trans}_B)$ to be a function $f_V:V_A \to V_B$ and a family of functions $f_E(a, b):E_A(a, b) \to E_B(f_V(a), f_V(b))$

Composition of extensional functions is defined as composition of the vertex function and of each edge function. 

An extensional function between two setoids is **full** if every edge function $f_E(a, b):E_A(a, b) \to E_B(f_V(a), f_V(b))$ is a [[surjection]], and an extensional function is **faithful** if every edge function is an [[injection]]. An extensional function is **[[injective-on-objects]]** if the vertex function $f_V:V_A \to V_B$ is an [[injection]], **[[surjective-on-objects]]** if the vertex function is a [[surjection]], and **[[bijective-on-objects]]** if the vertex function is a [[bijection]]. 

An extensional function is a **[[dagger functor]]** if additionally it preserves the functions $\mathrm{refl}$, $\mathrm{sym}$, $\mathrm{trans}$ 
$$f_E(a, a)(\mathrm{refl}_A(a)) = \mathrm{refl}_B(f_V(a))$$
$$f_E(a, b)(\mathrm{sym}_A(a, b)(f)) = \mathrm{sym}_B(f_V(a), f_V(b))(f_E(a, b)(f))$$
$$f_E(a, c)(\mathrm{trans}_A(f,g)) = \mathrm{trans}_B(f_E(a, b)(f), f_E(b, c)(g)$$

An **isomorphism of setoids** is a [[full and faithful]] [[bijective-on-objects]] [[dagger functor]]. 

### Equivalence of definitions

Given a one-set-of-edges setoid $E\rightrightarrows V$, we define a family-of-sets-of-edges setoid by taking $E(x,y)$ to be the [[preimage]] of $(x,y)$ under the [[function]] $(s,t):E \to V\times V$.  Conversely, given a family-of-sets-of-edges setoid we define a one-set-of-edges setoid by taking $E$ to be the [[disjoint union]] of the families of edges $E = \coprod_{x,y\in V} E(x,y)$. 

...

## Examples

Every [[category]] with a [[contravariant functor|contravariant]] [[endofunctor]] that is the [[identity-on-objects]] is a [[setoid]] where

* for every vertex $a \in V$, $b \in V$, $c \in V$, and $d \in V$ and edge $f \in E(a, b)$, $g \in E(b, c)$, and $h \in E(c, d)$
$$\mathrm{trans}(a, b, d)(f, \mathrm{trans}(b, c, d)(g, h)) = \mathrm{trans}(a, c, d)(\mathrm{trans}(a, b, c)(f, g), h)$$

* for every vertex $a \in V$, $b \in V$ and edge $f \in E(a, b)$
$$\mathrm{trans}(a, b, b)(f, \mathrm{refl}(b)) = f$$

* for every vertex $a \in V$, $b \in V$ and edge $f \in E(a, b)$
$$\mathrm{trans}(a, a, b)(\mathrm{refl}(a), f) = f$$

This includes [[dagger categories]], where additionally

* for every vertex $a \in V$, $b \in V$ and edge $f \in E(a, b)$
$$\mathrm{sym}(a, b)(\mathrm{sym}(b, a)(f)) = f$$

* for every vertex $a \in V$, $b \in V$, $c \in V$ and edge $f \in E(a, b)$, $g \in E(b, c)$
$$\mathrm{sym}(a, c)(\mathrm{trans}(a, b, c)(f, g)) = \mathrm{trans}(c, b, a)(\mathrm{sym}(a, b)(f), \mathrm{sym}(b, c)(g))$$

* for every vertex $a \in V$
$$\mathrm{sym}(a, a)(\mathrm{refl}(a)) = \mathrm{refl}(a)$$

and [[groupoids]], where

* for every vertex $a \in V$, $b \in V$ and edge $f \in E(a, b)$
$$\mathrm{trans}(a, b, a)(f, \mathrm{sym}(a, b)(f)) = \mathrm{refl}(a)$$

* for every vertex $a \in V$, $b \in V$ and edge $f:E(a, b)$
$$\mathrm{trans}(b, a, b)(\mathrm{sym}(a, b)(f), f) = \mathrm{refl}(b)$$

Additionally, a setoid with one vertex is equivalent to a [[pointed set|pointed]] [[magma]] with an [[endofunction]]. 

## Thin setoids

Recall in graph theory that a loop directed pseudograph is **simple** or a **loop digraph** if for every vertex $a \in V$ and $b \in V$, the set of edges $E(a, b)$ is a [[subsingleton]]: for every edge $f \in E(a, b)$ and $g \in E(a, b)$, $f = g$. In the other definition, a loop directed pseudograph is a loop digraph if the functions $s:E \to V$ and $t:E \to V$ are [[jointly monic]]. 

A setoid is **thin** or **simple** if its underlying loop directed pseudograph is a loop digraph. In both cases, the pseudo-equivalence relation becomes an **[[equivalence relation]]**. The term "thin" originates from category theory, while the term "simple" originates from graph theory. 

A thin setoid is equivalently a [[thin category|thin]] [[dagger category]], or a dagger category [[enriched category|enriched]] in [[truth values]]. A thin setoid is also a thin [[groupoid]], or a groupoid enriched in truth values. 

Sometimes in the mathematical literature, setoids are thin by default. 

## Core of a setoid

For any setoid $A$, the [[core]] of $A$ is defined as the maximal [[subgroupoid]] $\mathrm{Core}(A)$ of $A$. 

More specifically, a subsetoid $G$ of a setoid $A$ is a setoid $G$ with an faithful injective-on-objects dagger functor $f:G \to A$. A subsetoid $G$ of $A$ is a subgroupoid if the pseudo-equivalence relation of $G$ additionally satisfy the groupoid equational axioms: 

* for every vertex $a \in V_G$, $b \in V_G$, $c \in V_G$, and $d \in V_G$ and edge $f \in E_G(a, b)$, $g \in E_G(b, c)$, and $h \in E_G(c, d)$
$$\mathrm{trans}(a, b, d)(f, \mathrm{trans}(b, c, d)(g, h)) = \mathrm{trans}(a, c, d)(\mathrm{trans}(a, b, c)(f, g), h)$$

* for every vertex $a \in V_G$, $b \in V_G$ and edge $f \in E_G(a, b)$
$$\mathrm{trans}(a, b, b)(f, \mathrm{refl}(b)) = f$$

* for every vertex $a \in V_G$, $b \in V_G$ and edge $f \in E_G(a, b)$
$$\mathrm{trans}(a, a, b)(\mathrm{refl}(a), f) = f$$

* for every vertex $a \in V_G$, $b \in V_G$ and edge $f \in E_G(a, b)$
$$\mathrm{trans}(a, b, a)(f, \mathrm{sym}(a, b)(f)) = \mathrm{refl}(a)$$

* for every vertex $a \in V_G$, $b \in V_G$ and edge $f:E_G(a, b)$
$$\mathrm{trans}(b, a, b)(\mathrm{sym}(a, b)(f), f) = \mathrm{refl}(b)$$

A subgroupoid $G$ of a setoid $A$ is a maximal subgroupoid if the dagger functor $f:G \to A$ is bijective-on-objects, and additionally if, for every other subgroupoid $H$ of $A$ with faithful injective-on-objects dagger functor $g:H \to A$, there is a unique faithful injective-on-objects dagger functor $h:H \to G$ such that $h \circ f = g$. 

## Category of setoids

Let the category [[Set|$Set$]] be defined as a [[category]] that is [[finitely complete category|finitely complete]] and [[well-pointed category|well-pointed]] (i.e. whose [[terminal object]] is a [[extremal epimorphism|extremal]] [[separator|generating object]]). This category of sets is not even a [[regular category]], let alone an [[exact category]], as can happen in certain [[foundations of mathematics]], such as bare [[set-level type theory|set-level]] [[Martin-LÃ¶f type theory]], or [[ZFC]] and [[ETCS]] without the [[powerset]] [[axiom]]. The category $Setoid$ of __setoids__ is then the [[exact completion|ex/lex completion]] of Set. 

More specifically, using the definition of setoid with two sets: if $(s_R, t_R):R\rightrightarrows X$ and $(s_S, t_S):S\rightrightarrows Y$ are two setoids, a morphism between them in $Setoid$ is defined to be a function $f:X\to Y$ with functions $f_1:R \to S$ with $s_S \circ f_1 = f \circ s_R$ and $t_S \circ f_1 = f \circ t_R$. Moreover, we declare two such functions $f,g:X\to Y$ to be *equal* if there exists a function $h:X\to S$ such that $s \circ h = f$ and $t \circ h = g$.  Because $(s_S, t_S):S\rightrightarrows Y$ is a pseudo-equivalence relation, this defines an actual [[equivalence relation]] on the morphisms $f:X\to Y$, which is compatible with composition; thus we have a well-defined category $Setoid$ of setoids, which is the ex/lex completion of $Set$.

We have a [[full and faithful functor]] $Set\to Setoid$ sending an object $X$ to the pseudo-equivalence relation $(s_X, t_X):X\rightrightarrows X$. One can then verify directly that $Setoid$ is exact, that this embedding preserves finite limits, and that it is universal with respect to lex functors from $Set$ into exact categories.

If the [[presentation axiom]] (a weak form of the full axiom of choice) holds in $Set$, as a subcategory of $Setoid$, $Set$ could be thought of as the category of [[completely presented sets]], the category of sets with a [[projective presentation]]. If the [[axiom of choice]] holds in $Set$, then $Set$ is equivalent to $Setoid$, as the axiom of choice implies that $Set$ is its own free exact completion, and $Set$ is equivalent to $Setoid$ because the free functor from $Set$ to $Setoid$ is an [[equivalence of categories]]. 

This construction could be generalized to any [[finitely complete category]] $C$, from which the category of [[setoid objects]] of $C$ is the [[ex/lex completion]] of $C$, and denoted as $C_{ex/lex}$. If every [[epimorphism]] in $C$ is additionally a [[split epimorphism]], then $C$ is its own free exact completion. 

## In type theory

Many [[set-level type theories]] use [[type|types]] which are [[0-truncated]] and thus [[h-sets]] by default because of the inclusion of [[uniqueness of identity proofs]] or [[axiom K]] to the rule system of the type theory. Sometimes, these type theories do not have [[quotient set|quotients]] and [[image factorizations]], and as a result, setoids are used instead of the native h-sets. 

In [[homotopy type theory]], and more generally in any [[intensional type theory]] where not all types are [[h-sets]], such as in a type theory without [[uniqueness of identity proofs]] or [[axiom K]], the notion of "setoid" bifurcates into multiple distinct notions. In analogy with [[category]], the definitions used above in this article could be called a **strict setoid**. When the vertex types are only required to be a [[type]] rather than a [[set]], then this defines a **[[presetoid]]**. There is also the notion of a **[[univalent setoid]]**, where equality of vertices is isomorphism of vertices in the core of a presetoid. 

## Applications

In [[constructive mathematics]], we want the [[real numbers]] to form a [[linearly ordered set|linearly ordered]] [[Heyting field]] $R$ with completeness for located [[Dedekind cuts]].  Using [[power sets]] and a set $N$ of [[natural numbers]], one may form $R$ directly as a [[subset]] of $\mathcal{P}N$ (or something equivalent), but what if you wish to be (at least weakly) [[predicative mathematics|predicative]]? Using [[function sets]], one may form the Cauchy reals as a [[subquotient]] of $N^N$, but these are complete in the desired sense only if a weak form of [[countable choice]] (which follows from either the presentation axiom or [[excluded middle]]) holds. (Essentially, there may not be enough [[sequences]] of natural numbers.) Alternatively, if you have them, you can use [[prefunction]] sets and form $R$ as a subquotient of the set of _presequences_ of natural numbers.

The construction of $R$ above may also be done with entire relations if the [[axiom of fullness]] holds (see also [[real numbers object]]). Conversely, the axiom of fullness follows from the existence of sets of prefunctions; in addition to defining a functional entire prerelation, a prefunction between sets also defines an entire relation, and the set of these satisfies fullness.  (This is related to the idea that prefunctions between sets may be formalised as entire relations.)

See also the discussion at [[net]] about how to force the domain of a net to be [[partially ordered|partial order]], by using either entire relations or prefunctions as nets.

## Fixing inadequate foundations

Sometimes one finds a [[foundation]] of [[predicative mathematics]] in which it appears to be impossible to construct [[quotient sets]], leading to much hand-wringing. (For a simple example, simply remove the axiom of [[power sets]] from [[ZFC]] as normally presented.)  

Assuming (as usual) that the original foundation had equality relations on its sets, there will be identity prerelations on the presets, leading to a special class of sets which we may again call the __completely presented sets__. 

When you do this, the new kind of set is called a setoid, and then there may be hand-wringing about the need to use setoids instead of sets as one would like.  But if you didn\'t have quotient sets originally, then you shouldn\'t have been talking about 'sets' in the first place; theories of sets without quotient sets are really theories of presets. 

Some foundations also adopt an [[axiom of choice]] for functions which do not preserve the equivalence relation that, together with the identity relations, proves the [[presentation axiom]] for general sets, which means that free sets are completely presented sets. 

If you are willing to accept the [[presentation axiom]], then you can define a notion of setoid internal to a given theory of sets: as a [[projective set]]. (With the full axiom of choice, therefore, a setoid is simply a set.) Alternatively, you might forgo setoid as such but define a [[prefunction]] between sets to be an entire relation.

A similar result holds for [[SEAR plus epsilon|SEAR+$\epsilon$]].
