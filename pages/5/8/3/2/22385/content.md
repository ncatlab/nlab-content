## Idea

A **setoid** is a collection of things (which could be a [[set]], a [[type]], or a [[preset]] depending on the chosen [[foundations]]) equipped with an [[equivalence relation]] or a [[pseudo-equivalence relation]].  Setoids are commonly used in "impoverished" foundations of mathematics that lack a primitive notion of [[quotient]]; see for instance [[Bishop set]].
