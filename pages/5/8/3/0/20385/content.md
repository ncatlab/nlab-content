## Idea

In [[trigonometry]] the arccosine or "inverse cosine" is one of the [[inverse trigonometric functions]].

## Definition

The arccosine is a [[section]] (or [[right inverse]]) to the cosine function [[cos]], which in turn is one of the [[trigonometric functions]]. More precisely, it is the unique [[continuous function|continuous]] section of the [[epimorphism]] in the [[(epi, mono) factorization]] of the cosine such that its value at $0$ is $\pi/2$ (see [[pi]]).
