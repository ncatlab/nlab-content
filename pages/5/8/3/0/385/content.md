The _Crans-Gray tensor product_ is a [[tensor product]] on the category of [[strict omega-category|strict omega-categories]] which reduces to the [[Gray tensor product]] when restricted to [[strict 2-category|strict 2-categories]]. It provides the category of [[strict omega-category|strict omega-categories]] with a [[closed monoidal category|biclosed monoidal structure]] whose internal hom-objects are strict $\omega$-categories of lax $\infty$-functors, lax transformations between these etc.

The Crans-Gray tensor product can be understood as arising as follows:

there is an obvious [[monoidal category|monoidal structure]] on the [[cube category]] obtained from the obvious product of cellular [[geometric shapes for higher structures|cubes]] which is analogous to the cartesian product of the topological cubes $[0,1]^n$. By [[Day convolution]] this naturally indces a [[monoidal category|monoidal structure]] on [[cubical set|cubical sets]]. Strict $\omega$-categories, being [[globular set|globular sets]] with extra structure, can also be regarded as [[cubical set|cubical sets]] with extra structure and extra property. The Crans-Gray tensor product thus extends the tensor product on cubical sets to $\omega$-categories.

#Remarks#

 The Crans-Gray tensor product extends the tensor product  on strict $\omega$-groupoids given by R. Brown and P.J. Higgins (see below); they construct a symmetric monoidal closed structure on these $\omega$-groupoids. 

The third  paper below sets up an equivalence between globular $\omega$-categories and certain cubical $\omega$-categories with connections, to which the monoidal closed structure in the previous paper is easily extended.
