## Idea

While [[p-adic numbers]] and other [[non-archimedean fields]] may be [[complete topological space|complete]] with respect to the [[norm]] [[topology]] induced from their [[non-archimedean valuation]], this [[topology]] is generally not a useful topology on the [[affinoid domains]] over these spaces. For instance [[analytic continuation]] does not in general exist for these topologies. 

To remedy this ([Tate 71](#Tate71)) introduced a 
[[Grothendieck topology]] for such [[analytic spaces]] with respect to which there is a good [[analytic geometry]], namely what is called _[[rigid analytic geometry]]_.

This is simply the Grothendieck topology whose [[coverings]] are the covers by [[affinoid domain embeddings]]. It should probably be called the _Tate topology_. But in ([Bosch-G&#252;ntzer-Remmert 84,section 9.1.4](#BoschGuntzerRemmert84)) it is called the _G-topology_ (where actually "G" is short for "Grothendieck"...) and since then that name stuck.
