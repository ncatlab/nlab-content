## Definition

Let $C$ be a [[groupoid]].

A _permutation representation_ of $C$ is a [[representation]] of $C$ on [[Set]], i.e. a [[functor]] $C \to \Set$. 

A _linear permutation representation_ is a functor $C \to $ [[Vect]] that factors through a permutation representation via the [[free functor]] $k^{|-|}\colon  Set \to Vect$ which sends a set to the vector space for which this set is a basis.

###### Warning
In the usual literature of [[representation theory]], "linear permutation representations" are just called "permutation representations".

## Examples

Notably for $C = \mathbf{B}G$ the [[delooping]] [[groupoid]] of a [[group]] $G$, a permutation representation $\mathbf{B}G \to Set$ is a set equipped with a $G$-[[action]].

The category 

$$
  Rep(G, Set) \simeq PSh(\mathbf{B} G)
$$

is the [[classifying topos]] for the group $G$.

For other general perspectives on this see also at _[[infinity-action]]_ the section _[Examples -- Discrete group actions on sets](infinity-action#ExamplesPermutationRepresentations)_.
