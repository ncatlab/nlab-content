## Idea

While much of contemporary technology is based on effects of [[quantum physics]] --- [[semiconductor|transistors]] notably, hence electronic computers, but also [[lasers]] and much more --- these results of the technological "first quantum revolution" still largely operate on macroscopic [[quantum systems]]. Under *quantum technologies* proper one now understands -- anticipating or already beholding a "second quantum revolution" ([Dowling & Milburn 2003](#DowlingMilburn03)) -- technologies which make use of (arrangements of) *individual* and individually controlled [[quantum coherence|coherent]] [[quantum systems]], such as in the archetyical form of individual *[[qbits]]*.

Among quantum technologies (existing or anticipated) one counts notably

* [[quantum sensing]]

* [[quantum communication]]

* [[quantum cryptography]] 

* [[quantum machine learning]]

and, ultimately, universal

* [[quantum computing]]

and other incarnations of [[quantum information theory]] in [[quantum materials]].


Often underappreciated is that quantum technologies appear in two kinds, which may be called:

</div>

(1.) **quantum effects**, relying on *single* (even if oft repeated) quantum events (such as single [[quantum measurements]]),

(2.) **quantum processes**, being the more delicate [[quantum coherence|coherent]] concatenation of many quantum events.

The key practical difference is that *quantum effects* are application-ready and are already being commercially applied (e.g. in [[quantum key distribution]]), while for *quantum processes* (most forms of [[quantum computing]]) to scale-up beyond toy examples (namely beyond current "[NISQ](quantum+computation#ReferencesNISQ)" machines) will require solutions to the problem of *stabilization* or *error suppression*, either after the fact by software-level [[quantum error correction]], or, more ambitiously, right at the hardware-level by fundamental [[topological phase of matter|quantum topology]] ("[[topological quantum computing]]").
