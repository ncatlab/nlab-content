The term **exact category** has several different meanings.  Perhaps this should eventually be a disambiguation page, but right now it is about exact categories in the sense of Barr (also called "effective regular categories").

## Definition ##

An **exact category** (in the sense of Barr) is a [[regular category]] in which every [[equivalence relation]] is a [[kernel pair]].

## Consequences ##

If $R\hookrightarrow X\times X$ is an equivalence relation which is the kernel pair of $f:X \to Y$, then if $f = m p$ is the image factorization of $f$, one can show that $p$ is a [[coequalizer]] of $R$.  (Therefore, equivalence relations have [[quotient]]s in an exact category.)  However the converse is not true: there are regular categories having all coequalizers which are not exact.
