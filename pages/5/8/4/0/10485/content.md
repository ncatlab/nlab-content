## Idea
 {#Idea}

In [[solid state physics]], by a *[[phase of matter]]* which is 

* *symmetry protected topological* ("SPT", [Gu & Wen 09](#GuWen09), [PBTO 09](#PBTO09)) 

or more generally

* *symmetry enriched topological* ("SET", [CGLW 11, p. 3](#CGLW11), [CLM 12, p. 2](#CLM12))  

one means a [[topological phase of matter]] which is $G$-*[[equivariance|equivariantly]]* non-trivial, in that it cannot be [[quantum adiabatic theorem|adiabatically]] deformed to a trivial phase *while respecting some* $G$-[[symmetry]].
In case of SPT one in addition requires that the underlying topological phase (forgetting the symmetry) *is* trivial, while in case of SET this constraint is not implied.

Since, if one forgets (theoretically) the $G$-[[equivariance]], a $G$-equivariantly non-trivial SPT may be trivial as a plain topological phase, and two distinct SETs may be equivalent as plain topological phases,
one may regard the $G$-symmetry as "protecting" an SPT phase from decaying and as  "enriching" one plain phase to several distinct SET phases -- whence the terminology.

In other words:

1. distinct SPT/SET phases with a given symmetry cannot be [[quantum adiabatic theorem|adiabatically]] deformed into each other, in particular not without going through a [[phase transition]], *if* the whole deformation preserves the symmetry;

1. but they may possibly be transformed into each other this way if the symmetry is [[broken symmetry|broken]] during the deformation.


{#TypesOfSymmetries} There are the following types of symmetry groups $G$ to which the concept of crystalline SPT/SET phases applies (as well as to any of their [[semidirect product group|semidirect]] combinations):

1. $G$ may be an "external" **spatial** symmetry, namely a [[subgroup]] of the [[crystallographic group|crystallographic point group]] of the underlying [[crystal|crystalline]] material, canonically [[group action|acting]] on the [[Brillouin torus]] (BT) $\mathbb{T}^d$;

   for example *inversion* $I$ is the sign reversal [[involution]] on $\mathbb{R}^d \twoheadrightarrow \mathbb{T}^d$.

   If a [[topological insulator]]-phase is "protected" by a [[crystallographic group|crystallographic point group symmetry]] this way (possibly including [[time-reversal symmetry]]), then one speaks of a *[[topological crystalline insulator]]*. 

1. $G$ may be [[time reversal symmetry]] or [[charge]] reversal, which acts as $I$ on the Brillouin torus, but in addition acts on the [[Hamiltonian]] by [[complex conjugation]] and, respectively, sign reversal;

1. $G$ may be an **[[internal symmetry]]** which acts not on the position but on the "internal degrees of freedom" of (electrons in the) substance, which are, typically, located at each atomic site (whence also: "on-site symmetry").

   The prime example of an internal symmetry are ([[finite subgroup of SU(2)|finite]]) [[subgroups]] of the [[Spin(3)]]$\simeq$[[SU(2)]]-group which [[spin representation|acts]] on the [[electron]] [[spins]]. This will be a symmetry to the extent that spin [[interactions]] (such as the [[spin-orbit coupling]] or the intrinsic [[Lorentz force]] due to an external [[magnetic field]]) are negligible.



\begin{remark}\label{OnTerminology}
**(terminology)**

1. Beware that some authors insist on using the specific term "SPT" only for items further down in this list. 
For instance the claim below that SPT's are "classified by [[group cohomology]]" applies really to the last item (see [below](#ClassificationInternalSymmetries)). 

   The first two items instead, for the case of free fermion systems at least, are expected to have a classification in [[twisted equivariant K-theory|twisted equivariant]] [[topological K-theory]] (see at [[K-theory classification of topological phases of matter]]). 

   For the conceptual relation between these cases see [further below](#ClassificationInTermsOfKTheory).

1. Beware that the first articles on the topic ([Gu & Wen 09](#GuWen09), [PBTO 09](#PBTO09)) actually used the term "symmetry protected *topological order*". This could be perceived as somewhat of a misnomer, since in examples the (symmetry protected) "[[topological order]]" is often *trivial* (in that the [[ground state]] is non-degenerate and/or the [[Berry connection]] is [[abelian group|abelian]]) even though the underlying (symmetry protected) [[topological phase of matter|topological phase]] is non-trivial (ie. the [[valence bundle]] of a [[topological insulator]] has a non-trivial [[K-theory classification of topological phases of matter|K-class]]). 

   Due to this problem, the original authors argued that "SPT" could also stand for "symmetric protected *trivial order*" ([X.-G. Wen,  Sep 18, 2014](https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/136096/5603)). But then it seems more descriptive (and now fairly widely accepted) to speak of "symmetry protected topological phase". (See also at *[[red herring principle]]*.)

\end{remark}





## Examples

### Spatial symmetry


* The [[topological insulator]]/[[semi-metal]]-phase of [[graphene]] is protected  by [[time-reversal symmetry]] $T$ (and inversion symmetry $I$),  and for this historical reason this $T$- and/or $T I$-symmetry protection is taken by some authors to be the default meaning of [[topological insulator]].

* *Removing* the $T$/$I$-protection of the phase of graphene leads to *un-protected* [[Chern insulators]] such as (modeled by) the [[Haldane model]].

For more on spatial-SPT *[[topological crystalline insulator]]*-phases, see [there](topological+crystalline+insulator#ReferencesExperimentalRealization) for concrete examples.


### Internal symmetry


* The first example of SPT order is the [[Haldane phase]] of the [[Heisenberg model]] [[spin chain|spin-1 chain]] ([Haldane 83](#Haldane83)). It is a SPT phase protected by the [[internal symmetry]] [[Spin(3)|$Spin(3)$]]-group acting on the [[electron]] [[spin]] (often referred to in this context as a [[projective representation]] of [[SO(3)|$SO(3)$]]).

## Properties

### Classification 
 {#Classification}

#### Spatial symmetries

Symmetry protected [[crystal|crystalline]] phases where the [[dynamics]] of the [[electrons]] may approximately be regarded [[free field|free]] (but subject to the the atomic lattice Coulomb [[background field]], see [here](Dirac+field#FreeDiracFieldInCoulombBackground)) are thought to be classified by [[twisted equivariant K-theory|twisted equivariant]] [[topological K-theory]] of the [[Brillouin torus]]. This is the statement of the [[K-theory classification of topological phases of matter]]. 

Beware that this case has mostly been discussed for CPT-symmetries such as [[time-reversal symmetry]] (see at *[[topological insulator]]*) and for [[crystallographic group|crystallographic symmetries]] (see at *[[topological crystalline insulator]]*), not so much for [[internal symmetry|internal]] ("on site") symmetries (but see [Wen 12](#Wen12)).

#### Internal symmetries
 {#ClassificationInternalSymmetries}

In contrast, a widely cited claim [CGLW 11](#CGLW11) asserts (motivation is offered in [CLW 11, Sec. V](#CLW11)) that "*bosonic*" SPT orders for an *[[internal symmetry|internal]]* [[symmetry group]] $G_{int}$ are given by [[group cohomology]] $H^{d+1}\big(G;\, U(1)\big)$ of $G_{int}$ with [[coefficients]] in the [[circle group]] and in degree $d + 1$, for $d$ the effective [[dimension]] of the given material (in practice: $d \in \{0,1,2,3\}$).
This claim was generalized to fermionic SPT orders via a kind of group-supercohomology ([Gu & Wen14](#GuWen14)).

From X.-G. Wen ([2013, in rev 1](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/revision/symmetry+protected+topological+phase/1)):

> So the group (super-)cohomology theory may allow us to classify all SPT orders even for interacting systems, which include interacting topological insulator/superconductor.

But conceptual problems have remained with this proposal:

From [Wang & Senthil 14, p. 1](#WangSenthil14)

> this classification is now known not to be complete

{#XiongQuoteOpenProblem} From [Xiong 18](#Xiong18):

> Despite tremendous progress, a complete classification of SPT phases for arbitrary symmetries in arbitrary dimensions remains elusive. A number of classification proposals have been made in the general case: the Borel group cohomology proposal $[$[CGLW11](#CGLW11)$]$, the oriented cobordism proposal, the Freed-Hopkins proposal, and Kitaev’s proposal in the bosonic case; and the group supercohomology proposal $[$[GW14](#GuWen14)$]$, the spin cobordism proposal, the Freed-Hopkins proposal, and Kitaev’s proposal in the fermionic case. These proposals give differing predictions in certain dimensions for certain symmetry groups that cannot be attributed to differences in definitions or conventions. While more careful analysis has uncovered previously overlooked phases and input from topological field theories has brought us closer than ever to our destination, we believe that we can do much more.

From [BBCW 19, p. 3](#BBCW19):

> Although a remarkable amount of progress has been made on these deeply interrelated topics, a completely general understanding is lacking, and many questions remain. For example, although there are many partial results, the current understanding of fractionalization of quantum numbers, along with the classification and characterization of SETs is incomplete. 

> Moreover, while there have been many results towards understanding the properties of extrinsic defects in topological phases, there has been no general systematic understanding and, in particular, no concrete method of computing all the rich topological properties of the defects for an arbitrary topological phase. The study of topological phase transitions between different topological phases is also missing a general theory. In this paper, we develop a general systematic framework to understand these problems. 

\linebreak

The proposal of [BBCW 19](#BBCW19) (may not yet have a physics "proof" either, but) is conceptually transparent: The authors assume, as often done, that a [[topological order]] with [[anyon|anyonic]] [[defects]] is characterized by a [[unitary fusion category]] $\mathcal{C}$, and then propose that a $G_{int}$-SPT-phase $\Phi$ with this underlying topological order is what we may equivalently recognize as:

1. the [[equivalence class]] $[\Phi]$ of an [[∞-action]] of $G_{int}$ on $\mathcal{C}$, namely

1. the [[cohomology]]-class of a [[2-group]]-[[homomorphism]] from $G_{int}$ to the [[automorphism 2-group]] of $\mathcal{C}$:

   \[
     \label{GIntActionOnUnitaryFusionCategory}
     \Phi
     \;\in\;
     Hom
     \big(
       G_{int}
       ,\, 
       Aut(\mathcal{C}) 
     \big)
     \,,
   \]

   > (this is essentially [BBCW 19, (1)](#BBCW19) -- where it says "group action", but later from (81) on ([p. 14](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.4540.pdf#page=14)) it transpires that the correct [[2-group]]-action is indeed meant),

   namely:

1. the [[pseudonatural transformation]]-class of a [[weak 2-functor]]

   $$
     \Phi
     \;\in\;
     Maps
     \big(
       \mathbf{B}G_{int}
       ,\, 
       \mathbf{B}Aut(\mathcal{C}) 
     \big)
     \,,
   $$

   from the [[delooping groupoid]] of $G_{int}$ to that delooping [[2-groupoid]] of the [[automorphism 2-group]] of $\mathcal{C}$.

This is plausible (relative to the assumption that $\mathcal{C}$ characterizes the un-proteced topological order) since under an "[[internal symmetry]]" one wants to mean a global group action under which all other constructions have [[equivariant]]-[[structure]], and (eq:GIntActionOnUnitaryFusionCategory) is exactly the data that equips [[anyon]]-species (the [[simple objects]] of $\mathcal{C}$) and their [[fusion]] (the [[tensor product]]) and [[braid representation|braiding]] (the [[braiding]]) with such $G_{int}$-equivariant structure. 

\linebreak

{#ButNeitherOfThese} But neither of these proposals connects recognizably to the [[twisted equivariant K-theory|twisted equivariant]] [[K-theory classification of topological phases]] (TE-K). While the latter may not apply to all cases of symmetry symmetry protected topological phases, it certainly applies to some of them, and it currently stands out among all other proposals on the classification of [[topological phases of matter]] as being the one with the most detailed support by theory and experiment. Therefore it would be reassuring to see how any other classification proposal plausibly connects to the TE-K proposal in appropriate special cases (notably for phases well-approximated by free fermion dynamics).

{#ClassificationInTermsOfKTheory} Conversely, inspection of the mathematical construction of [[twisted equivariant K-theory]] (as made explicit in [[schreiber:Equivariant principal infinity-bundles|SS 21]], [(4.1.28)](https://ncatlab.org/schreiber/files/EquivariantInfinityBundles_220324.pdf#page=201)) readily reveals the evident way in which it subsumes [[internal symmetries]] and how the resulting structure has an equivalent expression in terms of [[∞-group cohomology]]. This is an immediate consequence of the [[mapping stack]]-[[adjoint (infinity,1)-functor|$\infty$-adjunction]], as shown the following diagram


<center>
<img src="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/InternalSymmetryInTE-K_220513.jpg" width="860">
</center>

> (graphics from [[schreiber:Topological Quantum Computation in TED-K|SS 22b]])


Here the mapping stack adjunction...

* ...on the internal symmetry group factor (shown on the right) manifestly identifies the [[TE-K cohomology]]-group at the top with an [[∞-group cohomology|∞-group cohomology group]] of $G_{int}$ which plausibly matches, as before, the intuition one would have about internal symmetry groups acting on K-theoretically classified phases of matter;

* ..on the external symmetry group factor (shonw on the left) manifestly identifies the [[TE-K cohomology]]-group at the top with an [[inner local system]]-twisted sector of [[geometric fixed point spectrum|$G$-fixed]] TE-K-theory. Just this sector has been shown (in [[schreiber:Anyonic defect branes in TED-K-theory|SS 22a]], by recourse to the [[hypergeometric construction of KZ solutions]]) to host [[su(2)-anyon|SU(2)-]][[anyon]] [[wavefunctions]] (namely [[affine Lie algebra]]-[[conformal blocks]]) constituting [[braid representations]], and hence exactly the structure expected in a symmetry protected [[topological order]].
