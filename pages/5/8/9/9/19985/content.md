## Idea


The theory of _associative $n$-categories_ (ANCs) is a model of [[higher category theory]] with strictly [[associativity|associative]] [[composition]], developed by [Christoph Dorn](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/christoph.dorn/), [Christopher Douglas](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/christopher.douglas) and [Jamie Vicary](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~vicaryjo/). The theory is weakly unital, but has a canonical strictly-unital subtheory to which it can easily be restricted. Despite these strictness properties, it is conjectured that every [[weak n-category]] is weakly equivalent to an associative $n$-category with strict units.

All the weak structure of an ANC lives in a notion of homotopy between composites. This is similar to the case of a [[Gray category]], which is strictly associative and unital, but which has weak interchangers. In this sense, ANCs can be seen as a generalization of Gray categories.

This theory forms the basis for [[homotopy.io]], a [[proof assistant]] for higher category theory which is currently under development.
