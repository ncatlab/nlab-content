This entry will be about the 1960 thesis of [[Pierre Gabriel]], published in 1962 as

* __Des cat&#233;gories ab&#233;liennes__, Bulletin de la Soci&#233;t&#233; Math&#233;matique de France, 90 (1962), p. 323-448 ([numdam](http://www.numdam.org/item?id=BSMF_1962__90__323_0))

The article develops some of the central aspects of the theory of [[abelian category|abelian categories]] canonized few years earlier by Grothendieck in [[Tohoku]]. Most important is an advanced theory of [[localization]] in the setting of abelian categories (extending ideas of Serre), and the applications to the study of rings and modules (where an alternative reconstructions via [[Gabriel filter]]s is proposed), as well as of [[quasicoherent sheaf|quasicoherent sheaves]] on schemes. It contains a remarkable reconstruction theorem: for any abelian category Gabriel introduces a spectrum whose points are indecomposable injectives. For a reasonable class of commutative schemes this gives a reconstruction of a scheme out of the abelian category of quasicoherent sheaves on the scheme (later extended to all schemes using different kind of spectra and in that generality known as the Gabriel-Rosenberg theorem). This article is one of the main precursors of a modern, categorically oriented, direction in [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]].
