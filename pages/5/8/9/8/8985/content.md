## Idea

In [[category theory]], there is a common problem of the construction of [[free objects]] in "algebraic" categories.  The idea is that one has to start from some "[[generators and relations|generators]]" and repeatedly throw in the results of applying "operations", subject to some "[[generators and relations|relations]]", over and over again until the result "converges".  In general, this convergence will require a [[ordinal number|transfinite]] iteration, and the fact that it converges at all requires some smallness/accessibility hypotheses.

If this construction is performed in sufficient generality, then it includes a large number of important special cases, such as the following (not mutually exclusive):

* the [[free monad]] generated by an [[endofunctor]]
* the [[free monad]] generated by a [[pointed endofunctor]]
* the free [[monoid]] generated by an object of a [[monoidal category]]
* the [[orthogonal factorization system]] generated by a set of morphisms
* the [[reflective subcategory|reflectiveness]] of a [[orthogonality class|small-orthogonality class]]
* the reflectiveness of [[enriched category|enriched]] [[presheaves]] preserving certain [[limits]]
* the [[cocomplete category|cocompleteness]] of the category of [[algebra over a monad|algebras]] for a [[monad]]
* the existence of [[left adjoints]] to functors between categories of algebras for monads
* the existence of colimits for diagrams of monads
* the existence of colimits in categories of monoids
* the [[algebraic small object argument]] generating [[algebraic weak factorization systems]]
* the existence of [[W-types]] and [[inductive types]] in categories
* the existence of [[higher inductive types]] in categories

In 1980, [[Max Kelly]] [(Kelly)](#Kelly) wrote a very long paper detailing very precise and general conditions under which such constructions can be performed, and showing how they can all be reduced to the case of free algebras for *well-pointed endofunctors*.

In what follows we will summarize Kelly's constructions, restricted to the special case of [[accessible functors]] on [[locally presentable categories]].  Much of the technical apparatus of Kelly's paper (including, among other things, two different ambient orthogonal factorization systems $(E,M)$ and $(E',M')$, and assumptions such as "$T$ preserves the $E$-tightness of $(M',K)$-cones") becomes unnecessary in this case, which also includes many if not most of the important examples.

## Basic concepts

Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a [[locally presentable category]].  All endofunctors of $\mathcal{A}$ which we consider will be [[accessible functor|accessible]], that is, they preserve $\kappa$-[[filtered colimits]] for some sufficiently large [[cardinal number]] $\kappa$.  In fact, we will only need to know that they preserve sufficiently long [[transfinite compositions]].

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition
An endofunctor $S:\mathcal{A}\to \mathcal{A}$ is called **[[pointed endofunctor|pointed]]** if it is equipped with a natural transformation $\sigma:Id_\mathcal{A} \to S$.  It is called **well-pointed** if $S\sigma = \sigma S$ (as natural transformations $S\to S^2$).
=--

Of course, a [[monad]] can be regarded as a pointed endofunctor where $\sigma$ is its unit.  Such an endofunctor is well-pointed precisely when the monad is [[idempotent monad|idempotent]].

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition
If $H$ is an endofunctor, then an $H$-[[algebra for an endofunctor|algebra]] is an object $A$ together with a map $H A\to A$.  If $(S,\sigma)$ is a pointed endofunctor, then an $S$-algebra is an object $A$ with a map $a:S A \to A$ such that $a \sigma_A = 1_A$.
=--

We have obvious categories of algebras of both sorts.  Of course, any [[algebra for a monad]] is also an algebra for that monad *qua* pointed endofunctor.  The converse holds in the well-pointed/idempotent case.  In fact, we have:

+-- {: .num_lemma #WellPointedAlgebras}
###### Lemma
If $(S,\sigma)$ is well-pointed, then an object $A$ admits at most one $S$-algebra structure.  This happens exactly when $\sigma_A$ is an isomorphism, in which case its inverse is that unique algebra structure.
=--
+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
Commutativity of the diagram
$$
\begin{array}{ccc} 
S S A & \overset{S a}\to & S A \\
\mathllap{\scriptsize{\sigma_{S A}=S\sigma_A}}\uparrow && \;\;\;\;\uparrow\mathrlap{\scriptsize{\sigma_A}} \\
S A & \underset{a}\to & A
\end{array}
$$
gives that $\sigma_A\circ a= 1_{S A}$, which together with $a\sigma_A= 1_A$ gives the invertibility of $a\colon S A\to A$ and the uniqueness of the algebra structure.
=--
Thus, when $S$ is well-pointed, the category of $S$-algebras is a [[full subcategory]] of $\mathcal{A}$.  Well-pointed endofunctors are important, so we mention a few other ways to obtain them.

+-- {: .num_lemma #WellPointedQuotient}
###### Lemma
If $(S,\sigma)$ is a well-pointed endofunctor and $\alpha\colon S\to T$ is a natural transformation whose components are [[epimorphisms]], then $T$ is also well-pointed.
=--
+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
The putative transformation $\eta\colon 1\to T$ is the composition $\alpha\circ \sigma$. First of all notice that $\sigma T\circ \alpha = S\eta$, since
$$\begin{array}{cc} 
S\eta_A &= S \alpha_A \circ  S\sigma_A \\
&= S\alpha_A \circ \sigma_{S A}\\
&= \sigma_{T A}\circ \alpha_A
\end{array}$$
by naturality of the transformations involved. Now, it suffices to show that $\eta T \circ \alpha = T\eta \circ \alpha$: this follows, again, from
$$\begin{array}{ccc} 
(\eta T \circ \alpha)_A &=& \alpha_{T A}\circ \sigma_{T A}\circ \alpha_A \\
&=& \alpha_{T A} \circ S \eta_A\\
&=& T \eta_A \circ \alpha_A \\
&=& (T\eta \circ\alpha)_A\end{array}$$
Now since $\alpha$ is an epimorphism, we can conclude.
=--
+-- {: .num_lemma #WellPointedCointersection}
###### Lemma
Suppose $(S_i,\sigma_i)$ is a family of (accessible) well-pointed endofunctors and let $\sigma:Id \to S$ be the [[wide pushout]] of all the points $\sigma_i:Id \to S_i$.  Then $(S,\sigma)$ is (accessible and) well-pointed, and $S Alg = \bigcap_i (S_i Alg)$.
=--
+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
The last statement is almost obvious using Lemma \ref{WellPointedAlgebras} above. Well-pointedness for $S$ follows adapting Lemma \ref{WellPointedQuotient} to the case of a jointly epimorphic family of arrows $\{S_i\to S\}$, like the colimiting cocone for $S$.
=--
+-- {: .num_lemma #WellPointedTransfer}
###### Lemma
Let $F:\mathcal{A} \rightleftarrows \mathcal{B} :G$ be an adjunction and $(S',\sigma')$ an (accessible) well-pointed endofunctor on $\mathcal{A}$.  Let $(S,\sigma)$ be the pushout
$$ \array{ F G & \xrightarrow{F \sigma' G} & F S' G \\
  \downarrow && \downarrow \\
  Id & \xrightarrow{\sigma} & S. } $$
Then $(S,\sigma)$ is (accessible and) well-pointed, and $B\in\mathcal{B}$ is an $S$-algebra exactly when $G B$ is an $S'$-algebra.
=--

## Free algebras for well-pointed endofunctors

The basic theorem to which all others can be reduced is the following.

+-- {: .num_theorem #WellPointedFreeAlgebras}
###### Theorem
If $\mathcal{A}$ is [[locally presentable category|locally presentable]] and $S$ is an accessible well-pointed endofunctor, then $S Alg$ is [[reflective subcategory|reflective]] in $\mathcal{A}$.  Therefore, the algebraically-free monad on $S$ exists (and is accessible).
=--
+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
Given $A\in\mathcal{A}$, define [[induction|inductively]] the following transfinite sequence in $\mathcal{A}$:
$$ A \to S A \to S^2 A \to S^3 A \to \cdots $$
in which each transition map is a component of $\sigma$, and we take colimits at limit stages.  If we continue this out to some $\kappa$-filtered ordinal $\alpha$, where $S$ is $\kappa$-accessible, then $S$ will preserve the relevant colimit, and hence we have an induced action $S(S^\alpha A) \to S^\alpha A$.  It is easy to check that this makes $S^\alpha A$ into a reflection of $A$ into $S Alg$.
=--

Some important constructions are directly examples of this theorem.

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example
Let $K$ be a set of morphisms in $\mathcal{A}$; recall that an object $A\in\mathcal{A}$ is said to be *orthogonal* to $K$ if $\mathcal{A}(k,A)$ is a bijection for all $k\in K$, which is to say that each functor $\mathcal{A}(k,-):\mathcal{A}\to Set^{\mathbf{2}}$ takes $A$ to an isomorphism, where $Set^{\mathbf{2}}$ is the [[arrow category]] of [[Set]].
Now the subcategory of isomorphisms is reflective in $Set^{\mathbf{2}}$, hence is the algebras for a well-pointed endofunctor $R_k$.  By Lemma \ref{WellPointedTransfer}, there is a well-pointed endofunctor $S_k$ on $\mathcal{A}$ whose algebras are the objects orthogonal to $k$.  And by Lemma \ref{WellPointedCointersection}, there is a well-pointed endofunctor $S$ whose algebras are those objects orthogonal to all $k\in K$.  Thus, by Theorem \ref{WellPointedFreeAlgebras}, the category of objects orthogonal to $K$ is reflective in $\mathcal{A}$.
=--

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example
Applying the previous example on [[slice categories]], we can construct [[orthogonal factorization systems]].
=--

The rest of the constructions proceed by building, out of other data, a well-pointed endofunctor, and applying Theorem \ref{WellPointedFreeAlgebras}.


## Free algebras for pointed endofunctors

Now let $(T,\tau)$ be a general (accessible) pointed endofunctor, not necessarily well-pointed.  Let $T/\mathcal{A}$ denote the [[comma category]], whose objects are triples $(A,B,a)$ where $a:T A \to B$.  Then $T/\mathcal{A}$ is again locally presentable.

If $\alpha:T'\to T$ is a natural transformation, we have an adjunction $\alpha_! : T'/\mathcal{A} \rightleftarrows T/\mathcal{A}: \alpha^*$ in which $\alpha^*$ sends $(A,B,a)$ to $(A,B,a\circ \alpha_A)$ and $\alpha_!$ is defined by a pushout.

Note that if $\alpha$ is $\tau:Id \to T$, then $\tau^*(A,B,a)$ is the composite $A \xrightarrow{\tau_A} T A \xrightarrow{a} B$ in $\mathcal{A}^{\mathbf{2}} = Id/\mathcal{A}$.

+-- {: .num_lemma #PointedAlgebrasInComma}
###### Lemma
The category $T Alg$ of $T$-algebras is a reflective full subcategory of $T/\mathcal{A}$.
=--
+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
To see that $T Alg$ is a full subcategory assume that $(A,a)$ and $(B,b)$ are two algebras, and that $(f,g)$ is a morphism between the associated objects of $T/\mathcal{A}$; i.e. that $g\circ a = b\circ T f$.
Then we have $f = b\circ \tau_B\circ f = b\circ T f\circ \tau_A = g\circ a \circ \tau_A = g$, and the arrow $f=g$ is an algebra morphism.

Moreover, $(A,B,a)$ lies in $T Alg$ just when $\tau^*(A,B,a)$ is an isomorphism.  The isomorphisms are a reflective subcategory of $\mathcal{A}^{\mathbf{2}}$, hence the algebras for a well-pointed endofunctor $R$.  Now by Lemma \ref{WellPointedTransfer}, there is a well-pointed endofunctor $S$ of $T/\mathcal{A}$ whose algebras are precisely the $T$-algebras.  Now apply Theorem \ref{WellPointedFreeAlgebras}.
=--

+-- {: .num_theorem #PointedAlgebras}
###### Theorem
The category $T Alg$ is monadic over $\mathcal{A}$, and cocomplete.  In particular, the [[algebraically-free monad]] on $T$ exists and is accessible.
=--
+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
A left adjoint to the forgetful functor $T Alg \to \mathcal{A}$ is supplied by reflecting the object $(A,T A,\tau_A)$ of $T/\mathcal{A}$ into $T Alg$.  The [[monadicity theorem]] then applies.  Colimits can be constructed in $T/\mathcal{A}$ and then reflected into $T Alg$.
=--

It is possible to [[beta-reduction|beta-reduce]] this proof and describe the resulting transfinite construction more explicitly.  Given $(A,B,a)$, we define inductively a transfinite sequence
$$\array{ && T X_0 & \to & T X_1 & \to & T X_2 & \to & \dots \\
&& \downarrow^{x_0} && \downarrow^{x_1} && \downarrow^{x_2} \\
X_0 & \to & X_1 & \to & X_2 & \to & X_3 & \to & \dots }
$$
such that $X_\beta \to X_{\beta+1}$ is equal to $x_\beta \circ \tau_{X_\beta}$.

We begin with $X_0=A$, $X_1=B$, and $x_0 = a$.  Given $X_\beta$ and $X_{\beta+1}$, we define $x_{\beta+1}:T X_{\beta+1}\to X_{\beta+2}$ to be the coequalizer of the two composites
$$ T X_\beta \;\underoverset{T \tau}{\tau T}{\rightrightarrows}\; T^2 X_\beta \xrightarrow{T x_\beta} T X_{\beta+1}.$$
At limit ordinals $\alpha$ we take colimits, and at successors of limit ordinals we let $x_\alpha : T X_\alpha \to X_{\alpha+1}$ be the coequalizer of the two maps
$$ \array{ && \colim_{\beta\lt\alpha} X_{\beta+1} = X_\alpha \\
  & \nearrow && \searrow^{\tau} \\
  \colim_{\beta\lt\alpha} T X_\beta && \to && T X_\alpha.}
$$

###### Example
The [[algebraic weak factorization system|algebraic]] [[small object argument]] consists of building the free monad on a pointed endofunctor.
=--


## Free algebras for unpointed endofunctors

An algebra for an unpointed endofunctor $H$ is the same as an algebra for the pointed endofunctor $T \coloneqq Id + H$.  Thus, Theorem \ref{PointedAlgebras} can be applied to unpointed endofunctors as well.

In this case, the transfinite sequence for the free $H$-algebra on $A\in\mathcal{A}$ is much simpler: we have $X_0 = A$ and $X_{\beta+1} = A + H X_\beta$.

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example
A [[W-type]] in a category is an initial algebra for a [[polynomial functor]].  Equivalently, it is the free algebra on the initial object for that functor.  Thus, we obtain the existence of W-types, and likewise of more general [[inductive types]].
=--


## Colimits of algebras for a monad

Let $T$ be a monad on $\mathcal{A}$, and let $T Alg$ denote the category of $T$-algebras *qua* monad.

+-- {: .num_theorem #MonadAlgebras}
###### Theorem
The category $T Alg$ is a reflective subcategory of $T/\mathcal{A}$.
=--
+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
For $(A,B,a)\in T/\mathcal{A}$, consider the pushout
$$ \array{ T^2 A & \xrightarrow{\mu} & T A \\
  ^{T a}\downarrow && \downarrow\\
  T B & \xrightarrow{c} & D }
$$
Define $L:T/\mathcal{A}\to T/\mathcal{A}$ to take $(A,B,a)$ to $(B,D,c)$ in this pushout.  Then $L$-algebras (*qua* pointed endofunctor) are precisely $T$-algebras (*qua* monad), and we have a pointwise epimorphism $S\to L$, where $S$ is the well-pointed endofunctor from the proof of Theorem \ref{PointedAlgebras} whose algebras are the $T$-algebras (*qua* pointed endofunctor).  Thus, by Lemma \ref{WellPointedQuotient}, $L$ is well-pointed; now apply Theorem \ref{WellPointedFreeAlgebras}.
=--

+-- {: .num_cor}
###### Corollary
$T Alg$ is locally presentable.  Moreover, any functor $T Alg \to T' Alg$ induced by a monad morphism $T'\to T$ has a left adjoint.
=--
+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
Since $T Alg$ is reflective in the cocomplete $T/\mathcal{A}$, it is cocomplete.  Since it is [[accessible category|accessible]] by the [limit theorem](/nlab/show/accessible+category#Limits), it is locally presentable.  For the second statement, the functor $T/\mathcal{A} \to T'/\mathcal{A}$ has an easily defined left adjoint; now compose it with the reflection into $T/\mathcal{A}$.
=--


## Colimits of monads
{#ColimitsOfMonads}

When speaking of colimits of monads, we are not interested merely in colimits in the category of monads, but *algebraic colimits* in the following sense.  Let $V:K\to Monad (\mathcal{A})$ be a diagram in the category of monads on $\mathcal{A}$, and define a **$V$-algebra** to be an object $A$ together with $V_k$-algebra structures which commute with the images of morphisms in $K$.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition
An **algebraic colimit** of $V$ is a monad $P$ whose usual [[Eilenberg-Moore category]] $P Alg$ is equivalent, over $\mathcal{A}$, to the category of $V$-algebras.
=--

It follows, by arguments similar to those for [[algebraically-free monads]], that an algebraic colimit is also a colimit in the category of monads.

+-- {: .num_theorem #ColimitsOfMonads}
###### Theorem
Algebraic colimits of (accessible) monads exist (and are accessible).
=--
+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
WLOG we may assume $K$ has an initial object; otherwise, give it a new initial object $0$ and define $V_0 = Id$.  Let $T$ be the (pointwise) colimit of $V$ in the category of endofunctors of $\mathcal{A}$, with coprojections $r_k:V_k \to T$.  Our assumption on $K$ gives $T$ a unique point $Id \to V_0 \to T$ such that each $r_k$ is a map of pointed endofunctors.  Moreover, a $T$-algebra (*qua* pointed endofunctor) is an object $A$ together with compatible pointed-endofunctor-algebra structures for each $V_k$.  This clearly includes the $V$-algebras, as defined above, as a full subcategory.

We will show the category of $V$-algebras to be reflective in $T/\mathcal{A}$.  Given $(A,B,a)$, let $c:T B \to D$ be the joint coequalizer of all the parallel pairs
$$ \array{ && V_k A \\
  & ^{\mu_k}\nearrow && \searrow^{V_k \tau_k}\\
  V_k^2 A && \xrightarrow{id} && V_k^2 A &
  \xrightarrow{V_k (a r_k)} & V_k B & \xrightarrow{r_k } T B. }
$$
Let $L(A,B,a) \coloneqq (B,D,c)$, defining an endofunctor of $T/\mathcal{A}$.  Then $L$ is accessible, and an $L$-algebra is precisely a $V$-algebra.

Moreover, $L$ admits an epimorphic transformation from the well-pointed endofunctor $S$ defined as in Theorem \ref{PointedAlgebras} whose algebras are the $T$-algebras (*qua* pointed endofunctor).  Thus, by Lemma \ref{WellPointedQuotient}, $L$ is well-pointed; now apply Theorem \ref{WellPointedFreeAlgebras}.
