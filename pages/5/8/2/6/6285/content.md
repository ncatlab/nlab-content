## Statement

Wigner's theorem asserts that a [[function]] $f : H \to H$  from a [[Hilbert space]] to itself (not _assumed_ to be a [[linear functor]])  
is linear and in fact a (anti-)[[unitary operator]] (up to a phase) if only the function is 

1. [[surjective map|surjective]];

1. [[norm]]-preserving.


## Role in quantum mechanics

In [[quantum mechanics]] every symmetric operation needs to be a norm-preserving bijection from a [[Hilbert space]] of [[state]]s to itself. Hence Wigner's theorem asserts that in quantum mechanics symmetries are presented by [[unitary operator]]s (or more rarely [[anti-unitary operator]]s, as for example [[time reversal]]).
