## Idea

A [[super Lie algebra]] which is a [polyvector](super+Poincare+Lie+algebra#PolyvectorExtensions) [[Lie algebra extension|extension]] of the [[super Poincaré Lie algebra]] ([[supersymmetry]]) in $D = 10+1$ for  $N=1$ [[supersymmetry]] by [[charges]] corresponding to the [[M2-brane]] and the [[M5-brane]] ("[[extended supersymmetry]]"). 


## Properties

### As the algebra of conserved currents of the M-branes

In ([AGIT 89](#AGIT89)) it is shows that the M-algebra-like polyvector extensions arise as the algebras of [[conserved currents]] of the [[Green-Schwarz super p-brane sigma-models]].

By the discussion at [conserved current -- In higher prequantum geometry](conserved+current#InHigherPrequantumGeometry) this means that this is the degree-0 piece in the [[Heisenberg Lie n-algebra]] which is induced by regarding the WZW-curvature terms as super [[n-plectic forms]] on $\mathbb{R}^{10,1|32}$.

### As the Lie algebra of derivation of the SuGra Lie 3-algebra

In ([Castellani 05](#Castellani05)) it is 
implicitly shown, ([FSS 13](#FSS13)), that the M-extension arises  as the [[derivations]]/automorphisms of the [[supergravity Lie 3-algebra]]/[[supergravity Lie 6-algebra]] (see there for the details).
