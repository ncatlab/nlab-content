## Idea

Pythagorean rings are rings in which all elements satisfy the common Pythagorean identity, generalizing from the [[real numbers]]. 

## Definitions

Let $R$ be a (possibly [[nonassociative ring|nonassociative]] and/or possibly [[nonunital ring|nonunital]]) [[ring]]. Then $R$ is a __Pythagorean ring__ if it has a binary operation $p:R \times R \to R$ such that for every element $a$ and $b$ in $R$, $a^2 + b^2 = p(a,b)^2$. (Note all binary operations $\cdot$ have an associated cartesian square $(-)^2$ defined as $a^2 = a \cdot a$.)

## Properties

Due to the commutative nature of addition in an [[abelian group]], the binary operation $p$ is commutative as well. 

Every [[finitely generated]] $R$-[[module]] $A$ for a Pythagorean ring $R$ has an absolute value $\vert (-) \vert: A \to R$ given by iterating $p$ for all scalars $r_i$ in $R$ for an element $a$ in $A$. 

## Examples

* The real numbers are a Pythagorean ring. 

* A Pythagorean ring that is a [[field]] is a __[[Pythagorean field]]__.
