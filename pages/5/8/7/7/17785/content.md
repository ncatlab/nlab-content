## Idea

The concept of _super-scheme_ is the generalization of that of _[[scheme]]_ from [[commutative algebra]] to [[superalgebra]]: where an ordinary [[scheme]] is a space locally modeled on the [[formal dual]] of a [[commutative ring]] (i.e. an [[affine scheme]]), so a superscheme is a space locally modeled on the formal dual of a [[supercommutative algebra]].
