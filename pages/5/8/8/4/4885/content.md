The Reidemeister moves are local changes to knot or link diagrams.  The conventions are that part of the diagram is shown with the 'move' indicated, but that outside that the diagram of the link is unchanged and that no other part of the daigram appears at the crossings that are changed by that move. 

These moves were given in the book by Reidemeister (Knotentheorie, Ergebnisse de math,1932)

###Note: 
in manipulating a link diagram, the changes obtained by elongating, part of the diagram, rotinig it etc. are not counted as changing the strucutre of the diagram.  The 'moves' outline here do.
