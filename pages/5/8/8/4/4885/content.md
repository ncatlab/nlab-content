The Reidemeister moves are local changes to knot or link diagrams.  The conventions are that part of the diagram is shown with the 'move' indicated, but that outside that, the diagram of the link is unchanged and that no other part of the diagram appears at the crossings that are changed by that move. 

These moves were given in the book by Reidemeister (Knotentheorie, Ergebnisse de math,1932)

###Note: ### 
In manipulating a link diagram, the changes obtained by elongating part of the diagram, rotating it, etc., are not counted as changing the structure of the diagram provided they do not change any crossing,and so they may be done without comment.  The 'moves' outlined here do change things locally near crossings.
