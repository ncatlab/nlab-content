## Idea

The _Reidemeister moves_ are local changes to [[link diagrams]] which can be realised as [[isotopy|isotopies]] between the link diagrams from which they arise. Because of Reidemeister's theorem, Theorem \ref{TheoremReidemeister}, they are of fundamental importance in knot theory, allowing knots and links to be treated purely combinatorially and diagrammatically. 

The moves were introduced in the book [Reidemeister](#Reidemeister). 

## Definition

The convention below is that part of a [[link diagram]] is shown with the 'move' indicated, but that outside that, the diagram of the link is unchanged. As usual in knot theory, everything is up to [[planar isotopy]].

\begin{defn} The _first Reidemeister move_, or _R1 move_, allows either of the following replacements of a fragment of a link diagram to be made.

[[!include Reidemeister move 1 - SVG]]

\end{defn}

\begin{defn} The _second Reidemeister move_, or _R2 move_, allows either of the following replacements of a fragment of a link diagram to be made.

[[!include Reidemeister move 2 - SVG]]

\end{defn}

\begin{defn} The _third Reidemeister move_, or _R3 move_, allows the following replacement of a fragment of a link diagram to be made.

[[!include Reidemeister move 3 - SVG]]

\end{defn}

\begin{defn} A pair of link diagrams $D$ and $D'$ are  _isotopic_, or _isotopic by moves_, or _equivalent_ if there is a finite sequence of the moves R1, R2 and R3 taking $D$ to $D'$ up to planar isotopy. \end{defn} 

\begin{defn} A pair of link diagrams $D$ and $D'$ are  _regularly isotopic_ if there is a finite sequence of the moves R2 and R3 taking $D$ to $D'$ up to [[planar isotopy]]. \end{defn}

\begin{rmk} Both isotopy and and regular isotopy define equivalence relations on link diagrams. \end{rmk}

\begin{rmk} There are a number of variants of the R3 move. All of them can be obtained as a finite sequence of the Reidemeister moves as defined above. \end{rmk}

##Reidemeister's theorem

The following crucial theorem establishes that the Reidemeister moves are of central significance in knot theory.

\begin{thm} \label{TheoremReidemeister} Let $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$ be [[links]], and let $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$ be [[link diagrams]] of $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$ respectively. Then $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$ are equivalent if and only if $L_{1}$ is [[isotopy|isotopic]] to $L_{2}$. \end{thm}

The key idea of the proof is that of subdivision. Working piecewise-linearly, one can reduce to the consideration of a few 'minimal' moves on knot diagrams, which one shows can be obtained as a finite sequence of Reidemeister moves. See for example section 2.1 of [Kauffman](#KauffmanKnotDiagrammatics).

##Consequences of Reidemeister's theorem

Because of Theorem \ref{TheoremReidemeister}, we can use the Reidemeister moves to verify invariance of a potential [[link invariant]]. For instance, as none of the moves alters the number of components of a link diagram, the number of components is an isotopy invariant (which is not at all surprising!). We can conclude that the [[Hopf link]] and the [[Borromean rings]] are not isotopic. 

A slightly deeper observation is that the [[linking number]] is a link invariant, for which see that entry.

[[colourable knot|3-colourability]] is a [[knot invariant]] as is easy to check. This shows, for instance, that the trefoil knot is not equivalent to the unknot, and hence shows, very simply, that non-trivial knots exist. It also shows that the figure eight knot is not equivalent to the trefoil.
