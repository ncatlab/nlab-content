## Introduction

### The problem

In the context of [[quantum computation]], a pure *[[quantum circuit diagram]]* (originally: "quantum computational network", [Deutsch 1989](quantum+circuit#Deutsch89)) is a kind of [[string diagram]] ([Abramsky & Coecke 2004](quantum+circuit#AbramskyCoecke04)) in [[finite-dimensional vector spaces|finite-dimensional]] [[Hilbert spaces]], typically used to express a sequence of low-level [[quantum logic gate|quantum gates]] mapping between [[space of quantum states|spaces of]] [[pure quantum state|pure]] [[quantum states]].

A generic pure [[quantum circuit]] might look as follows:

\begin{imagefromfile}
    "file_name": "QuantumCircuitScheme-221025c.jpg",
    "width": "600",
    "unit": "px",
    "margin": {
        "top": -20,
        "bottom": 10,
        "right": 0, 
        "left": 10
    }
\end{imagefromfile}

Here, for instance, the "[[quantum gate]]" $U_{34}$ is a [[linear operator]] on the [[tensor product]] [[Hilbert space]] $\mathscr{H} \oplus \mathscr{H}$.

Notice that the quantum circuit is understood to be the actual [[string diagram]], up to the usual admissible topological deformations, not just the [[composition|composite]] [[linear transformation]] which it encodes: The compositeness of the diagram encodes how (e.g. in which order) available [[quantum gate]]-operations would be operated on an actual [[quantum computer]], and the composite linear map only encodes the inpute-to-output-specification of the resulting [[quantum computation]]. In this sense, quantum circuits constitute a [[quantum programming language]] and one also speaks of the "quantum circuit model of quantum computation" (e.g. [Nielsen & Chuang 2000, §II.4.6](#NielsenChuang00); [Miszczak 2011, §3](#Miszczak11), [2012, §4.3](#Miszczak12); [Beneti & Casati 2018, §3.2](#BenetiCasati18)).


Often the basic Hilbert space building block here is taken to be [[complex vector space|complex]] 2-[[dimension of a vector space|dimensional]], $\mathscr{H} \,\coloneqq\, \mathbb{C}^2$, in which case one speaks of a quantum circuit on *[[q-bits]]*.

Typically all [[quantum gates]] involved, and hence also the resulting [[composition|composite]] [[linear maps]], are assumed to be [[invertible]], as befits [[reversible computation]] by [[unitary operator|unitary]] quantum state evolution in [[quantum mechanics]].

\linebreak

**But more generally** and certainly in the broader context of [[quantum information theory]] (such as in formulating the [[quantum teleportation protocol]] and similar), quantum circuits are admitted to cross the [[quantum-classical divide]], in that they may involve:

1. *[[quantum measurement]]*,  

1. *[[quantum state preparation]]*,

1. *[[classically controlled quantum gates]]*.

All three of these appear already in basic examples such as the [[quantum teleportation protocol]]:

\begin{imagefromfile}
    "file_name": "QBitQuantumTeleportationProtocol-221109.jpg",
    "width": "830",
    "unit": "px",
    "margin": {
        "top": -20,
        "bottom": 20,
        "right": 0, 
        "left": 10
    }
\end{imagefromfile}

Yet more generally --- notably for any plausible implementation of [[quantum error correction]] --- one needs to allow for [[quantum measurement]]-results to be fed back during runtime ("[[dynamic lifting]]") into [[algorithms]] running on a universal classical computer which schedule further [[quantum circuit]]-execution, and so forth:

\begin{imagefromfile}
    "file_name": "SQRAMschema-WithDynLifting.jpg",
    "width": 500,
    "unit": "px",
    "margin": {
        "top": -20,
        "bottom": 20,
        "right": 0, 
        "left": 10
    },
    "caption": "SQRAM model adapted from [Nagarajan, Papanikolaou & Williams 2007, Fig 1](#NagarajanPapanikolaouWilliams07)"
\end{imagefromfile}



The conceptual subtlety with fully formalizing these common ideas is that [[quantum measurement]], in particular, is not only non-[[reversible computation|reversible]] (due to the [[quantum state collapse]] involved) but also [[nondeterministic computation|non-deterministic]], meaning that it is not immediately represented by a fixed linear map at all -- at least not between the original [[Hilbert spaces]]. 

Concretely, the "[[projection postulate]]" of [[quantum physics]] asserts ([von Neumann 1932](quantum+measurement#vonNeumann32); [Lüders 1951](quantum+measurement#Lüders51)) that:

1. measurement of [[quantum states]] is *with respect* to a choice of [[orthonormal linear basis]] $\big\{\vert \psi_b \rangle \big\}_{b : B}$ of the given [[Hilbert space]] $\mathscr{H}$ [[space of quantum states|of]] [[pure quantum states]];

1. the result of measurement on [[pure quantum states]] $\vert \psi \rangle \;\in\; \mathscr{H}$ is 

   1. a random value $b \in B$;

   1. the "[[collapse of the wavefunction|collapse]]" of the [[quantum state]] being measured by [[orthogonal linear basis|orthogonal]] [[projection operator|projection]] to the the [[linear span]] of the $b$th basis state.

      $$
        \array{
          P_b 
            &\colon&
          \mathscr{H} 
            &\xrightarrow{\phantom{---}}&
          \mathscr{H}_B \hookrightarrow \mathscr{H}
          \\
          &&
          \vert \psi \rangle
          &\mapsto&
          P_b \vert \psi \rangle
          \mathrlap{
            =
            \vert \psi_b \rangle
            \langle \psi_b \vert \psi \rangle
          }
        }
      $$ 
     

There are different ways to *[[type theory|type]]* the quantum measurement, taking into account the non-deterministic nature of its outcome: 

1. Regarding the [[direct sum]] $\bigoplus_{b \colon B} \mathscr{H}$ of [[Hilbert spaces]] as the [[logical disjunction]] ("or") of [[quantum logic]], one may regard measurement as being the [[linear map]] into the direct sum whose $b$th component is $P_b$.

   > This choice of typing appears (briefly) in [Selinger 2004](quantum+measurement#Selinger04), [p. 39](https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/papers/qpl.pdf#page=39), in a precursor discussion that led to the formulation of the [[quantum programming language]] *[[Quipper]]*.

1. Regarding the measurement outcome $b \in B$ as the observed [[context]] of the actual quantum collapse, one may regard the collapse projection as [[dependent type theory|dependently typed]].

   > Getting from previous option back to this one is known in the the [[Quipper]]-community as *[dynamic lifting](Quipper#ReferencesDynamicLifting)* (namely "of the measured bits back into the context")

\begin{imagefromfile}
    "file_name": "PossibleTypingsOfQuantumMeasurement-221025.jpg",
    "width": "560",
    "unit": "px",
    "margin": {
        "top": -20,
        "bottom": 20,
        "right": 0, 
        "left": 10
    }
\end{imagefromfile}

Both of these options naturally emerge and are naturally unified in the "[Quantum Modal Logic](necessity+and+possibility#ModalQuantumLogic)" inherent to [[dependent linear type theory]]: This is what we now discuss.



### A solution

The following discussion indicates[^1] how a natural [[quantum programming language]] for [[quantum information]]-processing protocols --- hence  for [[quantum circuits]] consisting of general [[quantum gates]] with classical control, including [[decoherence|de-coherent]] [[quantum measurement]]-gates and subsequent coherent quantum gates depending on these --- is elegantly subsumed within any [[dependent linear type theory|dependent linearly typed]] [[programming language]] which expresses the "[[yoga of six operations]]", such as is the case in the [[linear homotopy type theory]] of [Riley 2022](dependent+linear+type+theory#Riley22Thesis). 

[^1]: Full details to appear at: *[[schreiber:Topological Quantum Programming in Linear Homotopy Type Theory]]*.

This works by regarding classically controlled [[quantum states]] as having [[linear type|linear data types]] [[dependent type|dependent]] on classical control parameters and on measurement results, and then making the following key observations on **[modal quantum logic](necessity+and+possibility#ModalQuantumLogic)** with [[dependent linear types]]:

1. The "[[necessity]]" [[modality]] $\Box_C \coloneqq (p_C)^\ast (p_C)_\ast$ on [[linear types]] dependent on a given classical [[context]] $C$ (which includes classical control parameters as well as eventual [[quantum measurement]]-outcomes on the same footing) knows all about controlled [[quantum gates]]: These are identified just with the [[morphisms]] of the $\Box_C$-[[co-Kleisli category]], where the $\Box_C$-[[counit of a comonad|counit]] (taking a linear type "out of the comonad") reflects the [[quantum state collapse]] of [[quantum measurement]], and where the $\Box_C$-[[comultiplication]] encodes the [[superposition]]-principle.

1. The [[external tensor product]] of dependent linear types gives the compilation of [[quantum gates]] into [[quantum circuits]], essentially as familiar from the quantum [[string diagram]]-calculus of [Abramsky & Coecke 2004](finite+quantum+mechanics+in+terms+of+dagger-compact+categories#AbramskyCoecke04) with respect to the plain [[tensor product]], but now taking into account dependency on classical control and potential measurement outcomes. 

All constructions and proofs here flow readily from just the [[six operation yoga]] and ([[co-Kleisli category|co-]])[[Kleisli category|Kleisli theory]]. One key point is (eq:NecessityRespectsExternalTensorProduct) that the [[necessity]] [[modality]] respects the [[external tensor product]] -- so that these classically controlled quantum circuits are unambiguously defined --, under the assumption that it coincides with the [[formal duality|dual]] *[[possibility]]* modality $\lozenge_C \mathscr{H}_C$  on the quantum data types $\mathcal{H}_\bullet$ involved -- hence (in full generality) when the linear types are [[dualizable object|dualizable]] in the sense of [[ambidextrous adjunction|ambidexterity]] and specifically (in the traditional models) when [[space of quantum states|quantum state spaces]] are [[finite-dimensional vector space|finite dimensional]], as is the case in [[quantum information theory]].



Aspects of the following have a resemblance to some variants and categorical interpretations of the [[quantum programming language]] "[[Quipper]]" (see the references [there](Quipper#ReferencesDependentLinearTypesAndCategoricalSemantics)), but avoids (see [below](#NoticeTheTypingOfAQbit)) Quipper's problem of needing "dynamic lifting" (see [there](Quipper#ReferencesDynamicLifting)) of "measurement bits back into the context": The linear [[necessity]]-modality knows right away that measurement outcomes are recorded in the context. 

\linebreak

## Idea: Modal quantum logic via linear homotopy types

We assume a [[dependent linear type theory]] which [[functor|functorially]] obtains (as anticipated in [Schreiber 2014](dependent+linear+type+theory#Schreiber14), [§3.2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.7041.pdf#page=39) and established in [Riley 2022](dependent+linear+type+theory#Riley22Thesis), [§2.4](https://digitalcollections.wesleyan.edu/islandora/object/ir:3269)):

1. from a classical ("intuitionistic") [[type]] $X : Type$ a (large) type $LinType_X$ of [[linear types]] [[dependent type|dependent]] on $X$, equipped with [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]] [[closed monoidal category|closed monoidal structure]] $(-) \otimes (-)$ ([[tensor product]]) and $[-,\,-]$ ([[internal hom]]);

1. from a [[function]] $f : X_1 \xrightarrow{\;} X_2$ between classical types a [[yoga of six operations]] (specifically: a "[[Wirthmüller context]]") between their types of dependent linear types, hence a [[contravariant functor|contravariant]] [[substitution]]/[[pullback]] operation $f^\ast$ which is [[strong monoidal functor|strong monoidal]], [[strong closed functor|strong closed]] and extends to a [[base change]] [[adjoint triple]] (with [[left adjoint]] $f_!$ a version of [[dependent sum]] and [[right adjoint]] a version of [[dependent product]]):

### Classical modal logic
 {#ClassicalModalLogic}

First observe that (without imposing a further condition) also classical ("non-linear") [[dependent type theory]] provides an example of this [[yoga of six operations]] (actually five distinct operations, in the present case of [[Wirthmüller contexts]]), with:

1. [[tensor product]] given by [[product types]],

1. [[internal hom]] given by [[function types]],

1. $f^\ast$ given by [[context extension]],

1. $f_!$ given by [[dependent coproduct]],

1. $f_\ast$ given by [[dependent product]]. 



In this classical situation, the ([[comonad|co]]-)[[monad]] [[adjoint pair]] $\lozenge_C \dashv \Box_C$ induced by the [[adjoint triple]] is readily found (see [here](necessity+and+possibility#InFirstOrderLogicAndTypeTheory)) to reflect the [[necessity]]-[[modality]] and the [[possibility]]-[[modality]] of a kind of [[modal logic]] which regards the potential measurement outcomes $c : C$ as "[[possible worlds semantics|possible worlds]]":

\begin{imagefromfile}
    "file_name": "QCwthLHT-ClassicalNecessity-221003.jpg",
    "width": "900",
    "unit": "px",
    "margin": {
        "top": -30,
        "bottom": 20,
        "right": 0, 
        "left": 10
    }
\end{imagefromfile}

In fact there is (see [here](necessity+and+possibility#RelationToPotentiality)) a quadruple of ([[comonad|co-]])[[monad|monadic]] [[modalities]] associated with any [[base change]]:

<center>
<img src="/nlab/files/TheFourModalitiesOfBaseChange-221101b.jpg" width="370">
</center>

Here 

1. the definiteness-modality $\star$ is also known as the *[[writer comonad]]*;

1. the randomness-modality $\bigcirc$ is also known as the *[[reader monad]]*.

We recover the meaning of these expressions in terms of [[quantum measurement]] and [[quantum state preparation]], [below](#QuantumMeasurement).


(In general there may be richer dependency on classical contexts. In the next simplest case the [[base change]] is along the [[projection]] map out of a [[Cartesian product]] of classical types, which makes one of them label potential upcoming measurement results as before, while the other encodes further dependency on classical parameters, such as on previous measurement results:

\begin{imagefromfile}
    "file_name": "QCwthLHT-RelativeBaseChange-221003.jpg",
    "width": "670",
    "unit": "px",
    "margin": {
        "top": -30,
        "bottom": 20,
        "right": 0, 
        "left": 10
    }
\end{imagefromfile}

This plays a role for classically-controlled quantum gates, [below](#ClassicallyControlledQuantumGate)).


### Quantum modal logic
 {#QuantumModalLogic}

This general [[modal logic]] of [[possible worlds]] [found inside](necessity+and+possibility#InFirstOrderLogicAndTypeTheory) [[dependent type theory]] becomes subject to one curious further rule as we pass to genuinely [[linear types]], such as in the sense of [[stable homotopy types]] in [[linear homotopy type theory]]:


Namely, assuming that the potential measurement outcomes $c \colon C$ form a [[finite set]] --- which is the case of relevance in [[quantum information theory]] ---, the linearity or *[[stable (infinity,1)-category|stability]]* axiom implies that the [[base change]] down from the context $C$ becomes [[ambidextrous adjunction|ambidextrous]], in that on dependent linear types $\mathscr{H}_\bullet$ the [[coproduct]] computed by the  [[possibility]]-[[modality]] and the [[product]] computed by the [[necessity]]-[[modality]] *agree* (the situation of a "[[biproduct]]"):

$$
  BC : FinSet
  ,\;\;
  \mathscr{H}_\bullet
  \,\colon\,
  LinType_B
  \;\;\;\;\;
  \vdash
  \;\;\;\;\;
  \lozenge \mathscr{H}_\bullet 
    \;\simeq\; 
  \Box \mathscr{H}_\bullet
  \,.
$$

Curiously, in terms of [[modal logic]], this is the *[[Gell-Mann principle]]* of quantum physics:

$$
  \array{
    \llap{\text{The}}\; \text{possible}
    &
    \text{is} 
    &
    \text{necessary}
    &
    \text{and hence} 
    &
    \text{actualized}
    \\
    \lozenge \mathcal{H}_\bullet
    &
    \simeq
    &
    \Box \mathcal{H}_\bullet 
    &
    \xrightarrow{\phantom{--} \epsilon \phantom{--}} 
    &
    \mathcal{H}_{
      \bullet   
      \;
      \mathrlap{\text{with some probability}}
    }
  }
$$


Concretely, the [[linear homotopy type theory]] of [Riley 2022](dependent+linear+type+theory#Riley22Thesis) should have [[categorical semantics]] in the [[(infinity,1)-topos|$\infty$-topos]] of [[parameterized spectrum|parameterized]] [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum|$H\mathbb{C}$]]-[[module spectra]] ([[schreiber:Quantization via Linear homotopy types|S. 2014, Ex. 3.11]]) and [[complex vector spaces]] embed into this [[stable homotopy theory]] under passage to their [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectra]] (see the [[stable Dold-Kan correspondence]]).

\[
  \label{NotationalConvention}
\text{It is convenient and meaningful to declare the notational conventions to:}
  \phantom{--------------------}
\]
1. abbreviate $\mathscr{H} \,\coloneqq\, p_! \mathscr{H}_\bullet \,\simeq\, p_\ast \mathscr{H}_\bullet$

1. notationally suppress any outer application of $(p_B)^\ast \colon LinType \to LinType_B$;

Thereby, the definiteness/randomness modalities in relation to [[necessity and possibility]] of classical modal logic ([above](#ClassicalModalLogic)) may be expressed in quantum modal logic by:

\begin{imagefromfile}
    "file_name": "DefinitelyRandomlyViaPossiblyNecessarily.jpg",
    "width": "180",
    "unit": "px",
    "margin": {
        "top": -10,
        "bottom": 20,
        "right": 0, 
        "left": 10
    }
\end{imagefromfile}


This way, the default [[categorical semantics]] for modal quantum logic is that of [[bundles]] of [[finite dimensional vector spaces]] (finite-dimensional complex [[Hilbert spaces]]) over [[finite sets]]: In this case both $(p_C)_!$ as well as $(p_C)_\ast$ yield the ordinary [[direct sum]] of the [[fibers]] (a [[biproduct]]). Since this is the [[categorical semantics]] under which the following type theory describes the traditional [[quantum circuits]], we will adopt our notation to this case and denote the generic [[dependent linear type]] by $\mathcal{H}_\bullet : LinType_C$ and its generic [[term]] by the usual notation for [[quantum states]]: 

$$
  c : C 
  \;\;\;
  \vdash
  \;\;\; 
  \vert \psi_c \rangle \;\colon\; \mathcal{H}_c
  \,.
$$


one finds for the base change [[adjoint triple]] of [[dependent linear types]] along [[family of finite types|finite fibers]] (eq:FiniteBaseType)
that the interpretation of their ([[counit of a comonad|co-]])[[unit of a monad|units]] is as follows:


By the assumption that $B$ is [[finite set|finite]] and since [[Vect]] has [[biproducts]], the [[colimit]]/[[coproduct]] 

$$
  (p_B)_! \mathscr{V}_\bullet 
  \;=\; 
  \coprod_{b : B} \mathscr{V}_b
$$

and the [[limit]]/[[product]]

$$
  (p_B)_\ast \mathscr{V}_\bullet 
  \;=\; 
  \prod_{b : B} \mathscr{V}_b
$$

agree (we have an [[ambidextrous adjunction]]) and are both equivalent to the [[direct sum]]:

$$
  (p_B)_! \mathscr{V}_\bullet 
    \;\simeq\;
  (p_B)_\ast \mathscr{V}_\bullet 
  \;=\;
    \underset{b \colon B}{\bigoplus}
  \mathcal{V}_b
  \,.
$$

Accordingly, the underlying [[endofunctors]] of the induced [[monad]] and [[comonad]] on $k Vec_B$ 

$$
  \Box_B
  \;\coloneqq\;
  (p_B)^\ast (p_B)_\ast
  \;\;\vdash\;\;
  \lozenge_B
  \;\coloneqq\;
  (p_B)^\ast (p_B)_!
  \;\;\colon\;\;
  k Vec_B
  \longrightarrow
  k Vec_B
$$

agree, to make a [[self-adjoint functor]]

$$
  (p_B)^\ast
  \bigotimes_B 
  \;\;\vdash\;\; 
  (p_B)^\ast
  \bigotimes_B
  \;\;\;\colon\;\;\;
  k Vec
  \longrightarrow 
  k Vec
$$

which carries the [[structure]] both of a [[monad]] and of a [[comonad]].

This way, one finds that the four (co)unit operations of quantum modal logic are given as follows:

\[
  \label{QuantumModalUnits}
\]
\begin{imagefromfile}
    "file_name": "QCwthLHT-QuantumModalUnits-221110.jpg",
    "width": "840",
    "unit": "px",
    "margin": {
        "top": -10,
        "bottom": 20,
        "right": 0, 
        "left": 10
    }
\end{imagefromfile}


### Quantum modality
 {#TheQuantumModality}

In addition to the above [[axiom scheme|schemata]] of ([[comonad|co]])[[monads]] acting on the ([[dependent linear type|dependent]]) [[linear type|linear]] [[type systems]], we invoke the [[relative monad]]

$$
  \array{
    \mathrm{Q} 
    &\colon& 
    Type &\longrightarrow& 
    LType
    \\
    &&
    B &\mapsto& \underset{B}{\bigoplus} \mathbb{1}
  }
$$

which sends a [[finite type]] (in particular) to the [[direct sum]] that it [[linear span|spans]] (a detailed description of this relative monad is [here](relative+monad#LinearSpan)).

This is in fact [[idempotent monad|idempotent]], in that the actual [[monad]] on the full [[dependent linear type|dependent linear]] [[type system]] that this relative monad is induced by is the [[idempotent monad]] which witnesses a [[reflective subcategory]]-inclusion of the linear types into dependent linear types:

$$
  \mathrm{Q}
  \;\colon\;
  Type
  \xrightarrow{ (-) \times \mathbb{1} }
  DLType
  \twoheadrightarrow
  LType
  \xhookrightarrow{ \phantom{---} }
  DLType
  \,.
$$

This implies that whenever $D \;\colon\; LType$,  we may describe morphisms of the form $\mathrm{Q}B \to LType$ by [[Kleisli morphisms]] for $\mathrm{Q}$.

For example for $B = Bit$ the type of classical [[bits]], we have that
 
$$
  \mathrm{Q}(Bit)
  \;=\;
  QBit
$$

is the usual type of [[q-bits]].


### Quantum gates
 {#QuantumGates}

The morphisms in the [[co-Kleisli category|(co-)]][[Kleisli category]] of $\Box$ and $\bigcirc$ are [[linear maps]]

$$
  \mathscr{H}
  \;=\;
  \Box \mathscr{H}_\bullet
  \xrightarrow{\;}
  \bigcirc \mathscr{H}_\bullet
  \;=\;
  \mathscr{H}
$$

in the image of $p_B^\ast$
and as such are [[quantum gates]] (we show how to restrict these to [[unitary operators]] below in ...).

Inspection shows that the four ways of relating these to [[co-Kleisli category|(co-)]][[Kleisli category|Kleisli morphisms]] correspond to composing quantum gates with:

1. quantum measurement

1. quantum state preparation

1. quantum superposition

1. quantum parallelization:

### Quantum measurement
 {#QuantumMeasurement}


Specifically, $\Box_C$-**actualization is the measurement process** --  in that the $\Box_C$-[[counit of a comonad|counit]] implements exactly the rule for [[wavefunction collapse]] (due to [Lüders 1951](wave+function+collapse#Lüders51), following [von Neumann 1932, §III.3 and §VI](wave+function+collapse#vonNeumann32)) with regards to [[quantum  measurements]] in the $C$-indexed basis of the total Hilbert space 
$
  \mathcal{H} \coloneqq \Box_C \mathcal{H}_\bullet
$
which is encoded by its direct sum decomposition $\mathcal{H}_\bullet$:

        "bottom": 20,
        "right": 0, 
        "left": 10
    }
\end{imagefromfile}

Given this, the [Kleisli equivalence](Kleisli+category#KleisliEquivalence) for the [[necessity]] [[comonad]] $\Box_B$  is essentially the [[deferred measurement principle]] for [[quantum circuits]]:

\begin{imagefromfile}
    "file_name": "DeferredMeasurementAsKleisliEquiv-221027b.jpg",
    "width": "800",

        "bottom": 20,
        "right": 0, 
        "left": 10
    }
\end{imagefromfile}

We may understand quantum measurement in this form as the *[effect handling](monad+in+computer+science#MonadModulesInIdeaSection)* (in the sense of [[monads in computer science]]) of indefiniteness effects (in the sense of [potentiality modal logic](necessity+and+possibility#RelationToPotentiality)):

\begin{imagefromfile}
    "file_name": "QMeasurementViaIndefinitenessHandling-221109c.jpg",
    "width": "700",
    "unit": "px",
    "margin": {
        "top": -20,
        "bottom": 20,
        "right": 0, 
        "left": 10
    }
\end{imagefromfile}

Notice that this process may be understood as the "[[dynamic lifting]]" of [[quantum measurement]]-results into the [[context]] (here: $B = $ [[Bool]]) of the ambient [[dependent linear type theory]].

\linebreak


There is another possible typing of quantum measurement, where a measurement lands in the random [[reader monad]]:

\begin{imagefromfile}
    "file_name": "PossibleTypingsOfQuantumMeasurement-221028.jpg",
    "width": "600",
    "unit": "px",
    "margin": {
        "top": -30,
        "bottom": 20,
        "right": 0, 
        "left": 10
    }
\end{imagefromfile}


These two are related by the following [[commuting diagram]] (being the [[naturality square]] of the necessity-counit on the possibility-unit):

\[
  \label{MeasurementViaWritedComonad}
\]
\begin{imagefromfile}
    "file_name": "MeasurementViaRandomMonad-230227.jpg",
    "width": "680",

    "margin": {
        "top": -20,
        "bottom": 20,
        "right": 0, 
        "left": 10
    }
\end{imagefromfile}



In the bottom row are making use of the notation (eq:NotationalConvention).






### Quantum circuits
 {#QuantumCircuits}


While quantum gates have [[horizontal composition]] in the [[co-Kleisli category]], they also have a [[vertical composition]] given by [[external tensor product]]:

\begin{imagefromfile}
    "file_name": "QCwthLHT-ExternalTensorProduct-221001.jpg",
    "width": "690",
    "unit": "px",
    "margin": {
        "top": -30,
        "bottom": 20,
        "right": 0, 
        "left": 10
    }
\end{imagefromfile}

The point here is that the [[external tensor product]] records not just the [[tensor product]] on the given linear/quantum types, but also the fact that under combining two quantum gates/circuits, the types $C$ and $C'$ of their potential classical measurement outcomes combine into the type $C \times C'$ of [[pairs]] of outcomes (the [[Cartesian product]]) --- see the example of pairs of qbits, [below](#CombinationOfAPairOfQBits).



One checks that for ambidextrous/finite-dimensional dependent linear types, the [[necessity]]-[[modality]] respects the [[external tensor product]]:

\[
  \label{NecessityRespectsExternalTensorProduct}
  \Box_{C \times C'}
  \big(
    \mathscr{H}_\bullet
    \boxtimes
    \mathscr{H}'_\bullet
  \big)
  \;\simeq\;
  \Big(
    \big(
      \Box_{C}
      \mathscr{H}_\bullet
    \big)
    \boxtimes
    \big(
      \Box_{C '}
      \mathscr{H}'_\bullet
    \big)
  \Big)
\]


This implies that well-defined [[quantum circuits]] may be compiled from iterating between

1. horizontally composing morphisms in the [[co-Kleisli category]] of a [[necessity]]-modality applicable to given quantum types;

1. vertically adjoining such morphisms via their [[external tensor product]].

We illustrate [below](#QCwthLHT-QBits) how this provides a (programming) language for all traditional quantum circuits compiled from [[qbits]].

But the expressiveness of the ambient [[linear homotopy type theory]] is considerably larger and allows to handle more general notions of [[quantum circuits]] with the same language structures. For instance:

1. We may use (in fact: construct) quantum types as building blocks which are not just [[qbits]] but much richer spaces of [[conformal blocks]] ([[schreiber:Topological Quantum Programming in TED-K|SS22]]). This allows to natively compile quantum programs for [[anyon]] [[braid representation|braid gates]] as used in [[topological quantum computation]].

1. Instead of just (parameterized) [[complex vector spaces]], the language of [[linear homotopy type theory]] in [Riley 2022](dependent+linear+type+theory#Riley22Thesis) handles more general ([[parameterized spectra|parameterized]]) [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectra|$H\mathbb{C}$]]-[[module spectra]], and in fact ([[parameterized spectra|parameterized]]) $R$-[[module spectra]] over any [[E-infinity ring|$E_\infty$-]][[ring spectrum]] $R$. 

  (A first example of [[quantum gates]] operating on [[spectra]] appears in the above-mentioned construction of [[conformal block]] if one just omits the fiberwise [[0-truncation]] in the last step.)

## Example: Traditional QBit-based quantum circuits
 {#QCwthLHT-QBits}

We spell out in terms of the above [[modal type theory|modal]] [[quantum logic]] found inside [[dependent linear type theory]] the traditional zoo of [[quantum gates]] and basic [[quantum circuits]] acting on [[tensor products]] of [[qbits]]. On the one hand this serves to show how all the expected constructions are naturally recovered, on the other hand it enhances these standard concepts by what is de-facto a [[quantum programming language]] for their classically-controlled versions (as such somewhat akin to parts of [[Quipper]], but avoiding the issue of "dynamic lifting", see [below](#NoticeTheTypingOfAQbit)).

\linebreak


To start with, a moment of reflection reveals that the [[linear type]] of a single (in-)coherent *[[qbit]]* is as follows, [[dependent linear type|depending]] on the classical [[type]] of [[booleans]] (which here we denote by "0" and "1" instead of "[[false]]" and "[[true]]") .


\begin{imagefromfile}

        "right": 0, 
        "left": 10
    }
\end{imagefromfile}

\linebreak


The [[quantum measurement]]-process on such a qbit type, as seen by the [[necessity]]-[[counit of a comonad|counit]], verifies the [[wavefunction collapse|projection postulate]] of measurements in [[quantum mechanics]]:

\begin{imagefromfile}
    "file_name": "QCwthLHT-QBitMeasurement-221001.jpg",
    "width": "500",

        "bottom": 20,
        "right": 0, 
        "left": 10
    }
\end{imagefromfile}

{#NoticeTheTypingOfAQbit} Notice that one might be tempted[^2] to think  of this formula as outputting the classical bit $b : \mathrm{Bool}$, but that the dependent typing of the above expression is a little more subtle than that:  The output bit is instead part of the *[[context]]* inside which the collapsed wavefunction qbit appears -- which, being in the 1-dimensional Hilbert space $\mathbb{C}$ in this case, may often be disregarded as a global phase, but is nevertheless the actual output of the measurement process.

[^2]: Indeed, in *[[Quipper]]* the measurement process on a qbit is originally typed as "$\QBit \to \Bit$" and further language design is needed to "bring the output bit back into the context", see references on "[dynamic lifting](Quipper#ReferencesDynamicLifting)".


In particular, by retaining the quantum type of the measurement result, we retain the ability to speak about repeated quantum measurement, which leads to a *proof* that the second measurement necessarily gives the same result as the first (the experimental observation of this fact is what originally led to the formulation of the projection postulate, in [von Neumann 1932, §III.3](wave+function+collapse#vonNeumann32)):

    }
\end{imagefromfile}


\linebreak


{#CombinationOfAPairOfQBits} In the other (vertical) direction, the dependent linear type of the measurement of a [[pair]] of [[qbits]] comes out as expected, where the point to notice is how the [[external tensor product]] keeps track of the fact that a pair of qbits has $2 \times 2 = 4$ potential measurement outcomes:

\begin{imagefromfile}
    "file_name": "QCwthLHT-QBitPairMeasurement-221001.jpg",
    "width": "770",

        "right": 0, 
        "left": 10
    }
\end{imagefromfile}


\linebreak


Dually, the [[possibility]]-[[unit of a monad|unit]] on [[qbits]] is their *conditional [[state preparation]]* (this is the operation denoted "$\underline{a} \xleftarrow{\;} a$" in [Knill 1996](quantum+programming+language#Knill96), [p. 8](https://www.ncatlab.org/nlab/files/Knill-QuantumPseudocode.pdf#page=8)):

    }
\end{imagefromfile}

From this, if we denote $\mathrm{const}_0 \colon \Bool \to \Bool$ the function [[constant function|constant]] on $0$, then the *unconditional [[state preparation]]* (the operation denoted "$\underline{a} \xleftarrow{\;} 0$" in [Knill 1996](quantum+programming+language#Knill96), [p. 8](https://www.ncatlab.org/nlab/files/Knill-QuantumPseudocode.pdf#page=8)) is the base change of the conditional [[state preparation]] along this map:

## Quantum Programming Language
 {#TheQuantumProgrammingLanguage}

With all elements of [[quantum circuits]] formulated via ([[comonad|co]])[[monads]] constructed inside a language of [[dependent linear types]] as above, we obtain an [[domain specific embedded programming language|embedded]] [[quantum programming language]] for quantum circuits with classical control and effects.

### Quantum/classical types and modalities

We use the following notation for the [[type system]] and the quantum/classical [[modalities]] on these. 

\begin{imagefromfile}
    "file_name": "QS_QuantumClassicalDataTypes-221123.jpg",
    "width": "520",
    "unit": "px",
    "margin": {
        "top": -20,
        "bottom": 20,
        "right": 0, 
        "left": 10
    }
\end{imagefromfile}


Here the expressions in square brackets may be thought of as the corresponding [[categorical semantics]] as [[bundles]] of linear types (for instance semantics [[internalization|in]] the category [[VectBund]] of [[complex vector bundles]] over [[Sets]], or more generally, in the [[(infinity,1)-category|$\infty$-category]] of [[parameterized spectrum|parametrized]] [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum|$H\mathbb{C}$-]][[module spectra]]).

The classical modality $\natural$ and the quantum modality  $\mathrm{Q}$ send a bundle type to its base and to its "linearized total space", respectively:

\begin{imagefromfile}
    "file_name": "QS_QuantumClassicalDivide-221123.jpg",
    "width": "700",
    "unit": "px",
    "margin": {
        "top": -20,
        "bottom": 20,
        "right": 0, 
        "left": 10
    }
\end{imagefromfile}

(The quantum monad $\mathrm{Q}$ is a [[relative monad]]; its [[categorical semantics]] in [[VectBund]] is discussed [there](relative+monad#LinearSpan).)

The classical [[internal hom]] and its quantum version relative to the ("[[external tensor product|external]]") linear [[tensor product]] (for more on this see the discussion [here](VectBund#ClosedMonoidalStructures) at *[[VectBund]]*):

\begin{imagefromfile}
    "file_name": "QS_ProductAndFunctionTypes-221123.jpg",
    "width": "800",
    "unit": "px",
    "margin": {
        "top": -20,
        "bottom": 20,
        "right": 0, 
        "left": 10
    }
\end{imagefromfile}


Notice that all these types are bundles "*in themselves*", in that we did not invoke (yet) any [[dependent types]] (semantically we speak about a total [[tangent (infinity,1)-topos|tangent $\infty$-topos]], not its system of [[slice (infinity,1)-category|slice $\infty$-categories]]).

Instead, the actual $B$-[[dependent types]] that we need to reflect ("[[dynamic lifting]]" of) [[quantum measurement]] will all be viewed, indirectly, through the lens of $\bigcirc_B$-modales on the non-dependent types (view the [[comparison functor]] which here is an equivalence).

The only explicit [[context]] that we do need to consider is -- besides the trivial dependency on the classical [[unit type]] $\ast$, its quantum analog namely: -- dependency on the [[tensor unit]] $\mathbb{1}$. This only exception to the rule we *sugar away* by the following "circle-colon"-notation (which is meant to rhyme on the "$\multimap$"-notation for [[linear implication]]):

\begin{imagefromfile}
    "file_name": "QS_QuantumDataDeclaration-221123.jpg",
    "width": "480",
    "unit": "px",
    "margin": {
        "top": -20,
        "bottom": 20,
        "right": 0, 
        "left": 10
    }
\end{imagefromfile}



### Sugaring modal dependent linear types to a quantum language

We now obtain  a quantum programming language from [[modal type theory|modal]] [[dependent linear type theory]] simply by meticulously [[syntactic sugar|sugaring]]:

[(1)](#ForDoNotation) the standard `do`-notation for [[monads in computer science]],

[(2)](#NotationForPureEffects) the ([[counit of a comonad|co]])[[unit of a monad|pure/return]]-functions of the various [[monads]].





#### Syntax for effect binding
 {#ForDoNotation}

We code maps in the [[Kleisli category]] of an [[monad in computer science|effect monad]] $\mathcal{E}$ by this schema:

\begin{imagefromfile}
    "file_name": "QS_ForDoNotation-221123b.jpg",
    "width": "440",
    "unit": "px",
    "margin": {
        "top": -20,
        "bottom": 20,
        "right": 0, 
        "left": 10
    }
\end{imagefromfile}



This syntax is to closely reflect the fact that 

* *for* an input of the form $\return^{\mathcal{E}}_D(d) \colon \mathcal{E}D$ 

* which may appear as a contribution *in* the effectful input data,

* the operation $\bind^{\mathcal{E}}_{\mathrm{prog}}$ *does* produce the output $\mathrm{prog}(d)$, 

which prescription completely defines it.

\begin{remark}
Beware that common classical notation for exactly the same costruction is a little different:

\begin{imagefromfile}
    "file_name": "ClassicalMonadicDoNotation-221123.jpg",
    "width": "280",
    "unit": "px",
    "margin": {
        "top": -20,
        "bottom": 20,
        "right": 0, 
        "left": 10
    }
\end{imagefromfile}


This classical notation is meant to suggest that pure data $d \colon D$ may be "read out" from effectful data $e \colon \mathcal{E}D$. While this is suggestive for the [[list monad]] and its common relatives in classical programming, it is misleading in [[linear type theory]] and notably so for the quantum monad $\mathrm{Q}$: Here the effectful input $e = \vert \psi \rangle$ is a quantum state like a [[q-bit]], in which case $d \colon Bit$ is a classical [[bit]], whence the classical notation "$d \leftarrow \vert \psi \rangle$" could only be suggestive of performing a [[quantum measurement]] -- in contradiction to the actual nature of the resulting $\bind^{\mathrm{Q}}_{\mathrm{prog}}$-operation constituting a coherent non-measurement quantum gate.

Instead, what really happens in Kleisli formalism is that operations are defined on *generators* for effectful data types $\mathcal{E}(D)$, namely on data of the form $\return^{\mathcal{E}}_D(d)$. For example, the space of [[qbits]] $\vert \psi \rangle \colon \QBit$ is generated (here: [[linear span|linearly spanned]]) by the [[linear basis|basis]] [[qbits]] $\vert 0 \rangle$ and $\vert 1 \rangle$, where we may naturally identify the ket-notation $\vert - \rangle$ as the unit/return operation which regards a classical bit $b$ as the corresponding basis quantum state $\vert b \rangle$.
\end{remark}


Moreover, we write an analogous `for...do`-code for maps out of [[tensor products]], using that these are generated from the homogeneous tensor products.


\begin{imagefromfile}

        "right": 0, 
        "left": 10
    }
\end{imagefromfile}


(...)



#### Syntax for pure effects
 {#NotationForPureEffects}

Finally, the monad-[[unit of a monad|return operations]] "$`return`^{\mathcal{E}}(-)$" (and the comonad [[counit of a comonad|extract operations]]) we sugar according to the following table:

\begin{imagefromfile}

        "right": 0, 
        "left": 10
    }
\end{imagefromfile}

In the same vein we sugar the constructor for terms in the [[quantum reader monad]] $\bigcirc_B$ as follows:
