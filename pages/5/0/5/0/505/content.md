A **subsingleton** generally refers to a [[subset]] (of some ambient set $A$) having at most one element.  That is, it is a subset $B$ of $A$ such that any two elements of $B$ are equal.

Of course, classically any subsingleton is either [[empty set|empty]] or a [[singleton]], but [[constructive mathematics|constructively]] this need not hold.  In a [[topos]], the "object of subsingletons in $A$" is the [[partial map classifier]] for $A$.
