## Idea

In [[linear algebra]], what is known as the *rank-nullity theorem* (e.g. 3.22 in [Axler (2015)](#Axler15), who calls it the *fundamental theorem of linear maps*) is the statement that for any [[linear map]] $f \colon V \to W$ out of a [[finite-dimensional vector space]], the [[sum]] of 

* the [[rank of a linear map|rank]] $rk(f) \coloneqq dim\big(im(f)\big)$, i.e. the [[dimension of a vector space|dimension]] of the [[image]];

with

* the *nullity* $nl(f) \coloneqq dim\big( ker(f) \big)$, i.e. the [[dimension of a vector space|dimension]] of the [[kernel]]

equals 

* the [[dimension]] $d_V \coloneqq dim(V)$ of the [[domain]] space $V$:

$$
  d_V \;=\; rk(f) + nl(f)
  \,.
$$

This rank-nullity theorem is the [[decategorification]] (under the [[dimension of a vector space|dimension]] [[functor]] $dim \colon FinDimVect \to \mathbb{Z}$) of the stronger statement that $V$ itself is the [[direct sum]] of its [[kernel]] and [[image]] [[vector spaces]]:

$$
  V \;\simeq\; im(f) \oplus ker(f)
  \,.
$$

This may be understood as an instance of the [[splitting lemma]] for [[vector spaces]], or more precisely of the statement ([here](split+exact+sequence#OfVectorSpaces)) that every [[short exact sequence]] of [[vector spaces]], such as

$$
  0 \to ker(f) \longrightarrow V \longrightarrow im(f) \to 0
$$

is a [[split exact sequence]], hence of the form

$$
  0 \to ker(f) \longrightarrow ker(f) \oplus im(f)  \longrightarrow im(f) \to 0
  \,.
$$
