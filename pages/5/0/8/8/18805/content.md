**In the [[differential geometry of curves and surfaces]]**, *the tangent* at a point on a [[smooth function|smooth]] [[curve]] in the [[Euclidean plane]] is the straight [[line]] through that point whose [[slope of a line|slope]] is that of the curve at that point. Unless the curve is actually itself "straight" in a vicinity of the point, the tangent is the unique straight line which in an [[open neighbourhood]] of the point on the curve has exactly that one point in common with the curve. In any case, the tangent to a curve may be thought of as the best approximation by a straight line of that curve at the given point.

**In [[trigonometry]]** one considers such tangents in the [[Euclidean plane]] for the case that the [[curve]] is a unit [[circle]]. Here the tangent to a point on the circle may also be understood as the unique straight line through that point which makes a [[right angle]] with the "radial" line through that point and the center of the circle.

The [[length]] of the segment of a tangent to a unit circle between its point of tangency and its intersection with any other radial line is, as a [[function]] of the [[angle]] between the two radial lines, known as the *[[tangent function]]*, traditionally denoted "$tan(-)$".

**More generally in [[differential geometry]]**, for a [[smooth manifold]] [[embedding of smooth manifolds|embedded]] inside a [[Euclidean space]], *a tangent line* through a point on the manifold is a straight line in the ambient Euclidean space through that point which is the "best approximation" of the manifold by a straight line "at that point and in that [[direction of a vector|direction]]".

This is made precise by the notion of *[[tangent vectors]]*, which may be understood as [[infinitesimal]] tangent lines to a smooth manifold and are as such independent of a choice of [[embedding of smooth manifolds|embedding]]. The collection of tangent vectors to a manifold is thus known as its *[[tangent bundle]]*.

More generally but analogously there are higher dimensional *tangent [[planes]]* and tangent [[hypersurfaces]] which infinitesimally are given by *tangent [[multivectors]]*.
