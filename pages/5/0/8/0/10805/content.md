Many [[theorems]] can be "comparison theorems". In [[geometry]]/[[cohomology]] the term is traditionally used to refer to statements that identify one [[cohomology theory]] with another over a suitable kind of [[spaces]], such as

* [[comparison theorem (Ã©tale cohomology)]]

* [[comparison theorem (crystalline cohomology)]]
