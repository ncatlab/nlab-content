## Things I need to work out ##

* Centers

I can not seem to figure out what the idea of Drinfeld center is supposed to be about over at the [[geometric infinity-function theory]] journal club page.  There are probably tons of other things I should be trying to really understand instead, but I am going to be stubborn and fixate on this one.

I want to know what the Drinfeld center is and also why
"the Drinfeld center is not a "sub" in any reasonable sense (except in the loose sense that it's a categorical limit)."

So maybe I should just start listing off different notions of center and trying to understand these and just hope for the best.

What types of centers do I know about?

A monoid $M$ has a center.

A group $G$ has a center.

A ring/algebra $A$ has a center.

These can all be interpreted as $1$-object categories where a morphism is in the center iff it commutes with all other morphisms.  This, of course, makes sense since all morphisms have the same source and target.

Each of these algebraic objects $\mathcal{C}$ has an injection from the center $Z(\mathcal{C})\hookrightarrow \mathcal{C}$.

In these cases, we interpeted the composition in the category as the binary operation which we could query for commutativity.  As these are all cases of monoids with extra structure, we really want to think of the composition as a monoidal product.  This leads us to a more general notion of the center of a category.

We consider the periodic table of $k$-tuply monoidal $n$-categories described here &lt;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week121.html>.  This generalized center takes us vertically down the columns of the periodic table.  Taking one object versions of the gadget in a certain square takes us southwest down the chart.

From poking around a bit it seems that having these ideas down we are supposed now start thinking about Hopf algebras.

Gotta go eat and for a walk...be back soon.
