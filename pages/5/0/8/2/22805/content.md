## Idea

A totally ordered ring is an [[ordered ring]] whose order forms a [[total order]]. 

## Definition

This definition is adapted from [[Peter Freyd]]'s definition of a [[totally ordered abelian group]]:

A __totally ordered ring__ is an [[pseudolattice ordered ring]] $R$ such that for all elements $a$ in $R$, $a \leq 0$ or $-a \leq 0$. 

In a totally ordered ring, the [[join]] is usually called the __maximum__, while the [[meet]] is usually called the __minimum__  

If the relation $\leq$ is only a [[preorder]], then the [[pseudolattice preordered ring]] $R$ is said to be a **totally preordered ring**. 

## Examples

The [[integers]], the [[rational numbers]], and the [[real numbers]] are totally ordered rings.
