**Simplicial models for weak $\omega$-categoies** -- sometimes called [[simplicial weak omega-category|simplicial weak omega-categories]] -- are a way  study weak $\omega$-[[omega-category|categories]] through their [[nerve]]s.  In effect, the goal is to _define_ a weak $\omega$-category to be a certain sort of ([[stratified simplicial set|stratified]]) simplicial set.  One could then hope to prove that these are precisely the [[nerve|nerves]] of weak $\omega$-categories defined in some other way.

This program was originally begun by Ross Street and has been carried forward by Dominic Verity with the theory of [[weak complicial set]]s.  It is expected that the (nerves of) weak $\omega$-categories will be weak complicial sets satisfying an extra "saturation" condition ensuring that "every [[equivalence]] is thin."

[[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: This term is kind of unfortunate; *simplicial weak $\omega$-category* could also mean a simplicial object in weak $\omega$-categories.  I don't suppose we can do anything about that?

[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: my impression is that what Dominic Verity mainly wants to express with the term is "simplicial model for weak $\omega$-category". Maybe we could/should use a longer phrase like that?

[[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: That would make me happier.

[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: okay, I changed it. Let me know if this is good now.
