## Idea

A **category of cubes** is a category of [[geometric shapes for higher structures]] in which the basic shapes are cubes of all dimensions.
There are actually many different categories of cubes, depending on what sorts of operations are permitted between cubes.
In general, we expect the following of a category of cubes:

* It is a [[monoidal category]] $(\Box,\otimes,I^0)$: the monoidal product of the "$n$-cube" and "$m$-cube" is the "$(n+m)$-cube", and the monoidal unit is the "$0$-cube" $I^{0}$.
* It contains an [[interval object]], the "1-cube", which is to say an object $I^{1}$ with two "faces" $i_0, i_1 \colon I^{0} \to I^{1}$ and a "degeneracy" $p \colon I^{1} \to I^{0}$ fitting in the diagram below.
\begin{tikzcd}
I^{0} \ar[dr,"id"{below left}] \ar[r,"i_0"] & I^{1} \ar[d,"p"] & \ar[l,"i_1"{above}] I^{1} \ar[dl,"id"{below right}] \\
& I^{0}
\end{tikzcd}
* Every object can be written as a monoidal product of $n \ge 0$ copies of the "$1$-cube".

Often one asks that the monoidal structure is [[strict monoidal category|strict]], in which case any cube category is a [[PRO]].
Besides the faces and degeneracies, a cube category might also include

* automorphisms of cubes, such as _permutations/symmetries_ or _reversals_;
* additional face-like maps, such as _diagonals_;
* additional degeneracy-like maps, such as [[connection on a cubical set|_connections_]].

Often we describe a cube category as generated by some subset of these morphisms.
Typically there is a functor from $\Box$ to [[Top]] sending the $n$-cube to the topological $n$-cube $[0,1]^n$.

A presheaf on a category of cubes is a [[cubical set]].

## Definitions

A uniform way to present many cube categories is as free (strict) monoidal categories with some structure, i.e., as classifying categories for monoidal theories ([Mauri 2005](#Mauri2005)).
This approach is described by [Grandis and Mauri (2003)](#GrandisMauri2003) and expanded upon by [Buchholtz and Morehouse (2017)](#BuchholtzMorehouse2017).
In these descriptions, some morphisms between cubes play the role of [[structural rule|structural rules]], reflecting additional requirements on the monoidal structure:

* Degeneracies (always included) correspond to [[semicartesian monoidal category|requiring the monoidal unit to be terminal]].
* Permutations correspond to requiring the monoidal product to be [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]].
* Diagonals correspond to requiring a [[monoidal category with diagonals]].

Including permutations thus makes the cube category a [[PROP]], while including all structural rules makes it a [[Lawvere theory]].
Other morphisms, such as connections or reversals, are instead "operations".

The construction of the classifying category can be unpacked into an explicit description of a cube category $\Box$ in terms of generating morphisms and relations (the "cubical identities").
Most cube categories can also be described as wide subcategories of the full subcategory of [[Set]] consisting of $\{0,1\}^n$ for $n \ge 0$: a morphism between cubes is determined by its behavior on vertices.

At least in the cartesian case, the classifying category description implies that $\Box$ is equivalent to the opposite of the category of free finitely-generated algebras for the theory.
The 1-cube $I^1$ can often be cast as a [[dualizing object]], yielding another description of the cube category.

### The ordered cube category

The **ordered cube category** or **restricted cube category** ([Grandis & Mauri 2003, Section 4](#GrandisMauri2003)) is the minimal cube category, generated by face and degeneracy maps.
When unqualified, "cube category" often refers to this category, which historically was the first to be defined.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

The **ordered cube category** is the free strict monoidal category with terminal unit $(\Box,\otimes,I^0)$ equipped with an object $I^{1}$ and two maps $i_0,i_1 : I^{0} \to I^{1}$.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Notation

Let $n \geq 0$ be an integer. We denote the object $\underbrace{I^{1} \otimes \cdots \otimes I^{1}}_{n}$ of $\Box$ by $I^{n}$. 

=--

See ([Grandis & Mauri 2003, Section 4](#GrandisMauri2003)) for the following two propositions.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Proposition

The ordered cube category is the classifying category of the monoidal theory of bipointed objects with the weakening structural rule.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn OrderedCubesInSet}
###### Proposition

The ordered cube category is isomorphic to the subcategory of $Set$ whose objects are powers $2^n$ of $2 = \{0, 1\}$, $n \geq 0$, and whose morphisms are generated by degeneracy maps $2^{n} \to 2^{n-1}$ which delete a coordinate and face maps $2^{n} \to 2^{n+1}$ which insert a 0 or 1 without modifying the order of coordinates.
The monoidal product is the restriction of the cartesian product on $Set$.
The basic face maps are the two inclusions $\delta^0, \delta^1 \colon 1 \to 2$ and the basic degeneracy is the map $\epsilon \colon 2 \to 1$.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Remark

It follows from Proposition \ref{OrderedCubesInSet} that every morphism in $\Box$ can be written as a finite composite of maps of the form $I^n \otimes \delta_\alpha \otimes I^m$ and $I^n \otimes \epsilon \otimes I^m$.
An explicit description of the ordered cube category by [[presentation of a category by generators and relations|generators and relations]] is in section 2 of

  * Sjoerd Crans, _Pasting schemes for the monoidal biclosed structure on $\omega-Cat$_ ([web](http://crans.fol.nl/papers/thten.html), [ps](http://crans.fol.nl/papers/thten.ps.gz), [[thten.pdf|pdf:file]])

=--

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Write $\Box_{\leq 1}$ for the full subcategory of $\Box$ consisting of $I^0$ and $I^1$.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Remark

The category $\Box_{\leq 1}$ is isomorphic to the category $\Delta_{\leq 1}$, i.e. it may also be described as

 * The full subcategory of the [[simplex category]] $\Delta$ on the objects $[0]$ and $[1]$.

 * (A skeleton of) the category of linearly ordered sets of cardinality 1 or 2.

 * The indexing category for [[reflexive coequalizer|reflexive equalizers]].

$\Box$ itself can be recovered as the [[free strict monoidal category]] on $\square_{\leq 1}$ whose unit object is $I^{0}$.
Note that $\Box$ is _not_ the free strict monoidal category on $\square_{\leq 1}$, but the free strict monoidal category _with specified unit_ on $\square_{\leq 1}$, where the unit is specified to be $I^{0}$.

### Cubes with connection

For $\alpha \in \{0,1\}$, an **$\alpha$-connection** in a cube category is a morphism $\gamma^\alpha \colon I^1 \otimes I^1 \to I^1$ such that $(I^1,\delta_\alpha,\gamma_\alpha)$ defines a [[monoid in a monoidal category]] and additionally the equations
$$
\gamma_\alpha \circ (\delta_{1-\alpha} \otimes I^1) = \gamma_\alpha \circ (I^1 \otimes \delta_{1-\alpha}) = \delta_{1-\alpha} \circ \epsilon
$$
hold.
Often these are called negative and positive connections rather than $0$- and $1$-connections respectively.
We can think of the negative connection as the morphism of topological spaces $[0,1]^2 \to [0,1]$ sending a pair of points $(x,y)$ to their maximum, likewise the positive connection as the minimum.
We may more generally refer to maps of the form $I^n \otimes \gamma_\alpha \otimes I^m$ as connections.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

The **ordered cube category with a $\alpha$-connection** is the free strict monoidal category with terminal unit $(\Box,\otimes,I^0)$ equipped with an object $I^{1}$, two maps $\delta_0,\delta_1 : I^{0} \to I^{1}$, and an $\alpha$-connection.

=--

We can also consider the cube category with both negative and positive connections.
The cube category has several advantages over the minimal cube category as a shape for higher structures; see [[connection on a cubical set]] for more information.

### Symmetric cube categories

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

The **symmetric cube category** is the free strict _symmetric_ monoidal category with terminal unit $(\Box,\otimes,I^0)$ equipped with an object $I^{1}$ and two maps $i_0,i_1 : I^{0} \to I^{1}$.

=--

The symmetric cube category is also called the [[semicartesian monoidal category|semicartesian]] cube category, as well as the "BCH" cube category after its use by [Bezem, Coquand, & Huber (2013)](#BezemCoquandHuber2013) to interpret [[homotopy type theory]] constructively.
It is also used in the semantics of [[parametric dependent type theory|internally parametric dependent type theory]].

The symmetric monoidal structure induces an automorphism $I^{\sigma} \colon I^n \cong I^n$ for each element $\sigma \in \Sigma_n$ of the [[symmetric group]] on $n$ elements.
The symmetric cube category can be compared with the [[symmetric simplicial set|symmetric simplex category]] and [[cyclic category]], which similarly add symmetries to the [[simplex category]].
Note that while the symmetric simplex category includes all the natural symmetries of an $n$-simplex, the symmetric cube category only includes the symmetries of the $n$-cube coming from permutations of the axes.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Remark

[Isaacson (2011)](#Isaacson2011) uses a cube category with symmetries and a positive connection, while [Grandis and Mauri (2003)](#GrandisMauri2003) describe a cube category $\mathbb{K}$ with symmetries and both positive and negative connections.
Grandis and Mauri also take the connections to be symmetric, making $(I^1,\delta_\alpha,\gamma_\alpha)$ are _commutative_ monoids for $\alpha \in \{0,1\}$, while Isaacson does not.

=--

### Cubes with reversals

An **reversal** or **reversion** in a cube category is a involution $\rho \colon I^1 \to I^1$ such that $\rho \circ \delta_{\alpha} = \delta_{1-\alpha}$ for $\alpha \in \{0,1\}$.
Topologically, we think of a reversal as the automorphism of the topological 1-cube $[0,1]$ sending $t$ to $1 - t$.


+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Remark

[Grandis and Mauri (2003, Section 9)](#GrandisMauri2003) consider a cube category $!\mathbb{K}$ generated by connections, symmetries, and reversals (on top of faces and degeneracies).
They also impose laws governing the interaction between reversals and connections, $\gamma^\alpha \circ (\rho \otimes \rho) = \rho \circ \gamma^{1-\alpha}$, which reflect the equations satisfied by the topological $min$, $max$, and reversal.

=--

### Cartesian cube categories

By adding diagonal morphisms $I^n \to I^n \otimes I^n$ on top of the symmetric cube category, we arrive at the cartesian cube category.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

The **cartesian cube category** is the free strict _cartesian_ monoidal category $(\Box,\otimes,I^0)$ equipped with an object $I^{1}$ and two maps $i_0,i_1 : I^{0} \to I^{1}$.

=--

The cartesian cube category is thus the [[Lawvere theory]] of [[bi-pointed object|bi-pointed objects]].
In particular, it is equivalent to the opposite of the category of free finite bi-pointed sets.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Remark

Symmetries can already be derived from the combination of degeneracies and diagonals $I^n \to I^n \otimes I^n$ [(Mauri 2005, Corollary 5.5)](#Mauri2005), though not if one only assumes a diagonal $I^1 \to I^1 \otimes I^1$.

=--

Cartesian cube categories (with or without additional structure) are used for in the semantics of [[homotopy type theory]] and [[cubical type theory]].

### The De Morgan cube category

The De Morgan, or "CCHM", cube category has faces, degeneracies, symmetries, diagonals, connections, and reversals.

## As shapes for higher structures

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Remark

Among all [[geometric shapes for higher structures]] cubes are best suited for describing Gray-like [[tensor product|tensor products]] of higher structures: there is geometrically obvious way in which to combine the $n$-cube $I^{n}$ and the $m$-cube $I^{m}$ to the $(n+m)$-cube $I^{n} \otimes I^m := I^{n+m}$. The monoidal structure on $\Box$ induces the canonical monoidal structure on [[cubical set|cubical sets]] and then on [[strict omega-category|strict omega-categories]]: the [[Crans-Gray tensor product]].

=--

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Remark

The cube category is a [[test category]]. Hence [[cubical sets]] model [[homotopy types]] (see also _[[model structure on cubical sets]]_). While it is not a [[strict test category]], it can be refined to the category of cubes with "[[connection on a cubical set|cube connection]]", which is. See _[[connection on a cubical set]]_ for more details.
