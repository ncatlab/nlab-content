#Idea#

The **cube category** $\Box$ encodes one of the main [[geometric shapes for higher structures]].

Its objects are the standard "$n$-cubes", for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and its morphisms are all possible ways of mapping cubes to each other.

#Definition#

A precise definition of the cube category can be found in section 2 of

* Sjoerd Crans, _Pasting schemes for the monoidal biclosed structure on $\omega-Cat$_ ([web](http://crans.fol.nl/papers/thten.html), [ps](http://crans.fol.nl/papers/thten.ps.gz), [[thten.pdf|pdf:file]])

The cube category is used to define [[cubical set|cubical sets]].

##Remarks##

Among all [[geometric shapes for higher structures]] cubes are best suited for describing Gray-like [[tensor product|tensor products]] of higher structures: there is geometrically obvious way in which to combine the $n$-cube $[n]$ and the $m$-cube $[m]$ to the $(n+m)$-cube $[n] \otimes [m] := [n+m]$. This makes $\Box$ into a [[monoidal category]]. It also induces the canonical monoidal structure on [[cubical set|cubical sets]] and then on [[strict omega-category|strict omega-categories]].
