#Motivation

The aim is to extend the intersection theory to the case of curves over $Spec(\mathbb{Z})$. Arakelov complemented the algebraic geometry at finite primes with a holomorphic piece at a point at infinity. Then using complex analytic geometry and Green functions he defined the intersections numbers using the complementary piece at infinity.

#History

After Arakelov there were main improvements by Faltings and Soule. Recently, [[Nikolai Durov]] found ([arxiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.2030)) a completely algebraic replacement (using generalized [[schemes]] whose local models are spectra of commutative [[algebraic monad]]s) for the original mixed approach; it is not known if that approach can be closely and precisely compared with the traditional.
