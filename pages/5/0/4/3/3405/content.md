__$Lat$__ is the [[category]] whose [[objects]] are [[lattices]] and whose [[morphisms]] are lattice [[homomorphisms]], that is [[functions]] which preserve finitary [[meets]] and [[joins]] (equivalently, binary meets and joins and the [[top]] and [[bottom]] elements).  $Lat$ is a [[subcategory]] of [[Pos]].

$Lat$ is given by a finitary [[variety of algebras]], or equivalently by a [[Lawvere theory]], so has all the usual properties of such categories.  By general abstract nonsense, the __[[free object|free]] lattice__ on a [[set]] $X$ exists, but it is not easy to describe in general.

*  The free lattice on the [[empty set]] is the [[Boolean domain]] $\{\bot, \top\}$.
*  The free lattice on a [[singleton]] $\{x\}$ is the $3$-element [[totally ordered set]] $\{\bot, x, \top\}$.
*  The free lattice on $\{x,y\}$ is (if I haven\'t messed up) $\{\bot, x \wedge y, x, y, x \vee y, \top\}$.
*  The free lattice on $3$ generators, despite the simplicity of the previous examples, is [[infinite set|infinite]].
*  The free lattice on any [[countable set]] can be made into a [[subalgebra|sublattice]] of the free lattice on $3$ generators!
*  The free lattice on an uncountable set is uncountable, of course.

The results about the free lattice on $3$ generators may be found in Section 4.6 of _[[Stone Spaces]]_, which sites Skornjakov\'s _Elements of Lattice Theory_.
