## Examples

* [[hadrons]] and [[mesons]] are bound states of [[quarks]]

* [[atoms]] are bound states of [[hadrons]] ([[protons]] and [[neutrons]]) and [[electrons]]

* [[molecules]] are bound states of [[atoms]]

* if quarks themselves were bound states (which they are not according to the [[standard model of particle physics]]) then one would call them bound states of _[[preons]]_

* [[D1-D5 brane bound states]]

* [[D-branes]] and [[anti D-branes]] form bound states by [[tachyon condensation]], thought to imply the classification of [[D-brane charge]] by [[K-theory]]
