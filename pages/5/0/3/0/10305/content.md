## Examples

* [[hadrons]] are bound states of [[quarks]]

  (at temperature high enough that these bound states decay, one speaks of a _[[quark-gluon plasma]]_)

* [[atomic nuclei]] are bound states of certain [[hadrons]], namely of [[protons]] and [[neutrons]] ([[nucleons]])

* [[atoms]] are [[bound states]] of [[nucleus (physics)|nuclei]] and [[electrons]]

  (at temperature high enough that these bound states decay, one speaks of a _[[plasma]]_)

* [[molecules]] are bound states of [[atoms]]

* if quarks themselves were bound states (which they are not according to the [[standard model of particle physics]]) then one would call them bound states of _[[preons]]_

* [[D1-D5 brane bound states]]

* [[D-branes]] and [[anti D-branes]] form bound states by [[tachyon condensation]], thought to imply the classification of [[D-brane charge]] by [[K-theory]]
