The **de Rham complex** of a [[manifold]] is the [[cochain complex]] which in degree $n \in \mathbb{N}$ has the [[vector space]] $\Omega^n(X)$ of degree-$n$ [[differential forms]] on $X$. The coboundary map is the deRham _[[exterior derivative]]_. The [[chain cohomology|cohomology]] of the de Rham complex is __de Rham cohomology__. De Rham cohomology has a rather subtle generalization for possibly singular algebraic varieties due to Grothendieck.

Under the [[wedge product]], the deRham complex becomes a [[differential graded algebra]]. This may be regarded as the [[Chevalley–Eilenberg algebra]] of the [[tangent Lie algebroid]] $T X$ of $X$.
