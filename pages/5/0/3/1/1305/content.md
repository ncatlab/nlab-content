For many topologists, analysts and so on, word compact means "a compact Hausdorff space". Some older topological schools distinguish a "compact space" (not necessarily including Hausdorff property) and "compactum" (which does); and similarly a "paracompact space" and "paracompactum". In algebraic geometry ,one often used terminology __quasicompact space__ to denote a topological space which is compact and not necessarily Hausdorff. Indeed, the Zariski topology on an algebraic variety and the topology of an etale space of a sheaf are typically not Hausdorff. More important, there is a relative version, namely the notion of a __quasicompact morphism__ of schemes (will include more details later). 
A scheme is quasicompact iff it has a Zariski cover by finitely many open affine subschemes. In particular, any affine scheme is quasicompact. 

Algebraic geometers sometimes also talk about __quasicompact objects__ in more general categories, meaning [[compact object]]s (object which corepresent covariant functors commuting with filtered colimits); with or without a modifier denoting a cardinal ($\kappa$-quasicompact objects).

[[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: To accord with terminological conventions, this page should probably be either "quasicompact space" or "quasicompact object."

[[Zoran Skoda]]: I do not know what are the conventions, but it was intentional to look both at quasicompact spaces and quasicompact morphisms (which are according to the dominant point of view in algebraic geometry, more important and basic notion); and aside also for q. objects. Personally I do not understand English-language preference for noun phrases. If one is to choose, quasicompact morphism is the choice.

_Toby_:  By the &#171;Each definition gets its own page.&#187; convention, I\'m not even sure that this shouldn\'t just redirect to [[compact space]] or [[compact object]].  My impression is that assuming that 'compact' implies Hausdorff is either (like assuming that 'ring' implies commutative) restricted to fields where it\'s a common assumption or to languages (I\'m thinking mostly of Bourbaki in French here) other than English.  On the other hand, if it\'s used that way by English-writing algebraic geometers, then I would seem to be wrong (since algebraic geometers often have non-Hausdorff spaces).
