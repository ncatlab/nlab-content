## Idea

In [[dependent type theory]], a _resizing rule_ is an [[introduction rule]] which allows, under suitable conditions, to find a [[type]] that is in some [[type universe]] $U_2$  also in a smaller [[type universe]] $U_1$.

## Examples

* [[propositional resizing]] (resizing all [[mere propositions]])

* [[propositional impredicativity]] (resizing the [[type of small propositions]])

* [[impredicative polymorphism]] (resizing universe-indexed [[dependent product types]] of universe-indexed [[type families]]). 

* [[type theoretic axiom of replacement]] (resizing [[images]] of [[functions]] from a [[small type]] to a [[locally small type]])

* [[axiom of fullness]] (resizing all types of small [[entire relations]])
