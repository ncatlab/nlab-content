Given a field $k$ and two $k$-[[bialgebra]]s $A$ and $B$ with [[Hopf pairing]] $\lt, \gt : A\otimes B\to k$, one defines a left [[Hopf action]] $\blacktriangleright$ of $B$ on $A$ by formulas
$$
b\blacktriangleright a = \sum \lt b, a_{(2)}\gt a_{(1)}= (\lt,\gt \otimes \id)(b\otimes \tau\Delta_A(a))
$$
one forms the __Heisenberg double__ corresponding to these data as the crossed product algebra ("smash product") $A\sharp B$ associated to the Hopf action $\blacktriangleright$. If $H$ is finite-dimensional then the Heisenberg double has a structure of a [[scalar extension bialgebroid]].

For example if $A = S(V)$ is the symmetric (Hopf) algebra on a finite-dimensional vector space $V$, and $B$ its algebraic dual $(S(V))^*\cong \hat{S}(V^*)$, considered as its dual topological Hopf algebra, the result is the [[Weyl algebra]] of [[regular differential operators]], completed with respect to the filtration corresponding to the degree of differential operator. If $B$ is just the finite dual of $S(V)$ which is a usual Hopf algebra, then there is no completion, of course.

In the following paper there is an example showing that the Heisenberg double $A^*\sharp A$ has a structure of a Hopf algebroid over $A^*$; moreover $A^*$ can be replaced by any module algebra over the [[Drinfel'd double]] $D(A)$:

The canonical element in the Heisenberg double satisfies a [[pentagon relation]], which is a version of pentagon relation for [[multiplicative unitaries]] of Baaj-Skandalis.  Kashaev has explained the pentagon relations for quantum [[dilogarithm]] as coming from the pentagon for the canonical element in the double.
