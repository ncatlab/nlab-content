## Definition

A [[topological space]] is called _$\sigma$-compact_ if it is the [[union]] of a [[countable set]] of [[compact topological space|compact]] [[subspaces]].

## Properties

* [[locally compact and sigma-compact spaces are paracompact]]

If a $\sigma$-compact space is also [[weakly locally compact]], then one can take the countable set of compact subspaces to be increasing, namely $K_i \subset K_{i+1}$, _and_ that $K_i$ is in the [[interior]] of $K_{i+1}$.

## Examples

Every compact space is trivially $\sigma$-compact. A discrete space is $\sigma$-compact if and only if it is countable. The product of a finite number of $\sigma$-compact spaces is $\sigma$-compact.

* [[locally compact and second-countable spaces are sigma-compact]]

This includes $\mathbb{R}^n$ with the Euclidean topology.
