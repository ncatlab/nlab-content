## Idea

__Zeroth-order set theory__ is that part of [[structural set theory]] that only deals with [[set]]s. Compare with [[first-order set theory]], which have [[family|families]], and [[higher-order set theory]], which have families of families. Also compare with [[propositional logic]], which is [[logic]] that deals with only [[proposition]]s, without any [[predicate]]s (families of propositions). 

Like how [[intuitionistic logic|intuitionistic]] [[propositional logic]] is the internal logic of an elementary [[(0,1)-topos]] or a [[Heyting algebra]] and [[classical logic|classical]] propositional logic is the internal logic of a [[Boolean algebra]], constructive zeroth-order set theory is the internal set theory of an [[elementary topos|elementary (1,1)-topos]] and classical set theory is the internal set theory of a [[Boolean topos]]. 

Most [[structural set theory|structural set theories]], such as [[ETCS]] or [[Mike Shulman]]'s [[SEAR]], are zeroth-order set theories, as the concept of family is not formalised in the theory.
