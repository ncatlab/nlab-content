##Idea

A very interesting discussion took place at the **nForum** involving [[André Joyal]], [[Urs Schreiber]], and others:

* [The nLab in the eyes of others](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Mathforge/nForum/comments.php?DiscussionID=548)

It was there that the germ of a potentially exciting idea arose. Just as the **nLab** itself arose out of the needs of a community built up around the **[nCafe](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/)**, could a new **CatLab** be built around the **[Category Theory Mailing List](http://blog.gmane.org/gmane.science.mathematics.categories)**?

The **CatLab** would be pari passu with the **nLab** and serve as a model for other mathematics communities. 

Here is the specific invitation extended by Andr&#233;:

>First, I thank Urs for inviting me to join your discussion. I was surprised, and pleased, by your interest in my potential collaboration. I will have to learn some MathML before actually contributing. As you know, I have suggested creating a CatLab not subordinated to the nLab. Let me try to explain my position clearly. It is partly a question of image, but as you know, the image can be important, since it carries a message about the nature and the goal of an organisation. The nLab is already successful and it will probably inspire other peoples in other fields into creating something similar. Let us try to think about the future. Mathematics is divided into branches and there is a social aspect attached to the division. Most mathematicians feel at lost outside their field. Nothing can stop them from creating a Lab for working in their field if they want to. They will chose the name of their lab according to the name of their field and its steering committee will reflect the sociology of their field. But the division of mathematics into fields is somewhat artificial and it can be an obstacle to progress. Assuming that everybody will eventually have a Lab in their field, these labs should be connected. In other words there should be a network of interconnected labs. The payoff of such a network could be enormous in terms of expansion and better efficiency of research and education in mathematics. The name of the network should probably be generic (like MathLabs ?). The lab devoted to category theory could be called CatLab. Category theory and higher category theory could emerge as unifying disciplines by the number of connections to them.

>In other words, I am inviting you to think about the future now.

After being reassured that there was no need to learn MathML (**CatLab** would be based on [itex](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/itex2MMLcommands.html), a close cousin to LaTeX), he continued:

>The unity and diversity of mathematics are complementary, not contradictory. It would be very good for mathematics to have a neutral network of interconnected labs reflecting this unity and diversity.

>I think that category theory and higher category theory could prosper enormously in such a network. Everyone should feel at home in his lab, without having to submit to a global ideology of category theory, or of higher category theory, or of constructive mathematics, or anything else.

Before rushing into the creation of **CatLab**, it was the purpose of this page to serve as a seed for its creation. The virtual ribbon cutting should be orchestrated by an active member of the **Category Theory Mailing List** and this page may serve as something of a **CatLab** sandbox to help potential  contributors get familiar with the possibilities.

A nascent CatLab may now be found at [[joyalscatlab:HomePage|joyalscatlab]], although it\'s final shape has yet be determined.

## Discussion

[[André]]: I warmly thank the $n$Lab community for their generous response to my suggestion. I am presently very short of time, but I will try to spend some learning the wiki-art during the next few weeks. The CatLab is an offspring of the nLab, not yet fully shaped and not yet born. Like every child, he has no shame in feeding to the breast of his mother. It will probably cannibalise the nLab a lot! I will do a lot of cutting and pasting, this is how I can learn quickly. I hope I will not mess things up! I apologise for the temporary disorganitation (posted by AJ). 

[[Eric]]: No worries and no rush. It's great to see how this material springing here and I'm sure **CatLab** will be ready for launch very soon. If you have questions, feel free to ask them either here or the forum. Since we're getting the hang of the wiki, my suggestion is to ask technical questions here. The answers will likely end up being added to [[HowTo]] and the [[FAQ]]. Cheers!
