[[Urs Schreiber]]: I added the code that induces the production of the above automatic table of contents (see the source code). Looking at it may help to organize the content of the (long) entry a bit.

_[[Toby Bartels]]_ writes: Then I organised the sections a bit, so perhaps it looks nicer now.  But we are fast reaching the point (if we are not already there) that this working example no longer fits on one page, so if you want to keep going, Andr&#233;, then you should probable return to [the discussion on the Forum](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Vanilla/nForum/comments.php?DiscussionID=548) and suggest that the steering committee create a CatLab web now.

[[Eric]]: I don't see any rush to create CatLab right away. If a spurious page or two is created here to help Andr&#233; get the hang of things, no harm will be done. Like his comment below (copied from the forum), let's relax and let the natural course develop. Think of it as a [Lamaze period](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamaze_technique) :)

##Idea

A very interesting discussion took place at the **nForum** involving [[André Joyal]], [[Urs Schreiber]], and others:

* [The nLab in the eyes of others](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Vanilla/nForum/comments.php?DiscussionID=548)

It was there that the germ of a potentially exciting idea arose. Just as the **nLab** itself arose out of the needs of a community built up around the **[nCafe](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/)**, could a new **CatLab** be built around the **[Category Theory Mailing List](http://blog.gmane.org/gmane.science.mathematics.categories)**?

The **CatLab** would be pari passu with the **nLab** and serve as a model for other mathematics communities. 

Here is the specific invitation extended by Andr&#233;:

>First, I thank Urs for inviting me to join your discussion. I was surprised, and pleased, by your interest in my potential collaboration. I will have to learn some MathML before actually contributing. As you know, I have suggested creating a CatLab not subordinated to the nLab. Let me try to explain my position clearly. It is partly a question of image, but as you know, the image can be important, since it carries a message about the nature and the goal of an organisation. The nLab is already successful and it will probably inspire other peoples in other fields into creating something similar. Let us try to think about the future. Mathematics is divided into branches and there is a social aspect attached to the division. Most mathematicians feel at lost outside their field. Nothing can stop them from creating a Lab for working in their field if they want to. They will chose the name of their lab according to the name of their field and its steering committee will reflect the sociology of their field. But the division of mathematics into fields is somewhat artificial and it can be an obstacle to progress. Assuming that everybody will eventually have a Lab in their field, these labs should be connected. In other words there should be a network of interconnected labs. The payoff of such a network could be enormous in terms of expansion and better efficiency of research and education in mathematics. The name of the network should probably be generic (like MathLabs ?). The lab devoted to category theory could be called CatLab. Category theory and higher category theory could emerge as unifying disciplines by the number of connections to them.

>In other words, I am inviting you to think about the future now.

After being reassured that there was no need to learn MathML (**CatLab** would be based on [itex](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/itex2MMLcommands.html), a close cousin to LaTeX), he continued:

>The unity and diversity of mathematics are complementary, not contradictory. It would be very good for mathematics to have a neutral network of interconnected labs reflecting this unity and diversity.

>I think that category theory and higher category theory could prosper enormously in such a network. Everyone should feel at home in his lab, without having to submit to a global ideology of category theory, or of higher category theory, or of constructive mathematics, or anything else.

Before rushing into the creation of **CatLab**, it is the purpose of this page to serve as a seed for its creation. The virtual ribbon cutting should be orchestrated by an active member of the **Category Theory Mailing List** and this page may serve as something of a **CatLab** sandbox to help potential  contributors get familiar with the possibilities.



##Discussion

[[André]]: I warmly thank the $n$Lab community for their generous response to my suggestion. I am presently very short of time, but I will try to spend some learning the wiki-art during the next few weeks. The CatLab is an offspring of the nLab, not yet fully shaped and not yet born. Like every child, he has no shame in feeding to the breast of his mother. It will probably cannibalise the nLab a lot! I will do a lot of cutting and pasting, this is how I can learn quickly. I hope I will not mess things up! I apologise for the temporary disorganitation (posted by AJ). 

[[Eric]]: No worries and no rush. It's great to see how this material springing here and I'm sure **CatLab** will be ready for launch very soon. If you have questions, feel free to ask them either here or the forum. Since we're getting the hang of the wiki, my suggestion is to ask technical questions here. The answers will likely end up being added to [[HowTo]] and the [[FAQ]]. Cheers!

## Welcome! ##

This is a [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki)-lab for collaborative work on _[[category theory|Category Theory]]_ --- branching out from the nLab. 
We think of this wiki as our **lab book** that we happen to keep lying around openly.  

+-- {: .standout}

The **purpose of the CatLab** is not to make polished expositions of material; that is a happy by-product. The purpose is to provide a public place where people can make notes about category theory.

We all make notes as we read papers, read books and doodle on pads of paper. The CatLab is somewhere to put all those notes, and, incidentally, to make them available to others. Others might read them and add or polish them. But even if they don't, it is still easier to link from them to other notes that you've made.

=--

This site started operation only a few days ago. Some structure is beginning to appear, but we are still in a very early stage. Your help is appreciated! 

* See [[About]] for some ideas of what the $n$Lab is trying to be, and of what it is not.

* See the [[HowTo]]-page to get started if you want to contribute.

* See [latest changes](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Vanilla/nForum/?CategoryID=5) to get an idea of recent activity and to log your own changes to the CatLab.

* There is a [forum](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Vanilla/nForum) (imaginatively called the $n$-Forum) for $n$Lab-related discussion
but we may eventually have a CatForum if God permits.

  * at [latest changes](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Vanilla/nForum/?CategoryID=5) we log our latest activity on the $n$Lab

  * We also keep having constitutive discussions there. See for instance

    [What is the scope of the nLab? Particularly original research?](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Vanilla/nForum/comments.php?DiscussionID=59)

    which is where the above description of the $n$lab as a lab book came from.

* Distilled wisdom from the various discussions is starting to appear on the [[FAQ]].

**Software requirements**

The CatLab displays mathematical symbols using [MathML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MathML).  Some web-browsers, notably [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/), know how to display this automatically, although you may need to install some fonts.  For InternetExplorer one needs the [MathPlayer](http://www.dessci.com/en/products/mathplayer/) plugin; download is quick and easy and free. For more see [[HowTo]].

Notice that **you don't need to know any MathML**. Only your browser does. You write formulas into the CatLab between dollar signs in [iTeX](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/itex2MMLcommands.html), which is designed to be very similar to ordinary LaTeX.

=--

The CatLab is a community undertaking. But for all matters that do require that the CatLab is represented to the outside by an official decision-taking body, we have the [[nlabmeta:steering committee|nLab steering committee]]. _Nobody "is in charge of the CatLab"._ But the steering committee is the closest approximation to a body being in charge that we have.


## Categories

### Definition

A _category_ $C$ consists of 

* a [[set]] $C_0$ of _[[objects]]_;

* for each pair of objects $a,b\in C_0$, a set $C(a,b)$ of _[[morphisms]]_ (or _arrows_) $a\to b$; when the context is clear, we write $f:a\to b$ to indicate that $f\in C(a,b)$;

* for each triples of objects $a,b,c\in C_0$, a _[[composition|composition law]]_ $C(b,c)\times C(a,b)\to C(a,c)$; when the context is clear, we write
 $g f:a\to c$ for the composite of $f:a\to b$ with $g:b\to c$;

* for each objet $a\in C_0$, an arrow $1_a:a\to a$ called the 
_unit_ or the
_[[identity morphism|identity morphism]]_ of $a$.


* such that the following properties are satisfied:

  * ( _associativity law_) $h (g f)=(h g) f$ for every triple of arrows $f:a\to b$, $g:b\to c$ and $h:c\to d$;

  * (the _left and right unit laws_) $1_b f=f 1_a =f$ for every arrow $f:a\to b$.
=--

### Notation

The set $C_0$ of objects of a category $C$ is often denoted $Ob(C)$.
But we shall often write $a\in C$ instead of $a\in Ob(C)$;
the set $C(a,b)$ is often denoted $hom_C(a,b)$, or just $hom(a,b)$
if the context is clear. A morphism $f:a\to a$ is said to be
an _[[endomorphism|endomorphism]]_ of the object $a$. The composition law
gives the set $hom(a,a)$ the structure of a monoid.

### Size issues 

The sets involved in the definition of a category can be small or 
large. A category $C$ is said to be _[[locally small category|locally small]]_ if the set 
$C(a,b)$ is small for every pair of objects $a,b\in C$. 
A category $C$ is said to be _[[small category|small]]_ if it is locally small and its set of objects $Ob(C)$ is small.
A category is said to be _[[large category|large]]_ if it is not small. 

### Examples

* We shall denote by [[Set]], the _[[Set|category of small sets]]_: an object of this category is a small set $S$ and an arrow $S\to T$ is a map $f:S\to T$; composition of arrows is defined by composing the maps, and the units
arrows are the identity maps. The category [[Set]] is large but locally small.


* Let $R$ be a ring. We shall denote by $Mat(R)$ the 
_category of matrices with coefficients in_ $R$; an object of this category is a natural number $n\geq 0$ and a morphism $m\to n$
is a $n\times m$ matrix with coefficients in $R$; the composite of
a matrix $A:m\to n$ with a matrix $B:n\to p$ is their product $B A:m\to p$;
the unit of $n$ is the $n\times n$ unit matrix. The category $Mat(R)$
is small.



* [[Grp]] - [[group]]s as objects, homomorphisms as morphisms.

* [[Ab]] - [[abelian group]]s as objects, homomorphisms as morphisms.

* [[Top]] - [[topological space]]s as objects, continuous functions as morphisms.


* [[Ring]] - [[ring]]s as objects, ring homomorphisms as morphisms.

* [[KVect]] - [[K-vector space]]s as objects, $K$-linear maps as morphisms.
 
These classic examples are the original motivation for the term "category": all of the above categories encapsulate one "kind of mathematical structure".  These are often called "concrete" categories (that term also has a [[concrete category|technical definition]] that these examples all satisfy).  


* **Poset** A [[partial order|poset]] can be thought of as a category with its elements as objects and one morphism in each $hom(x,y)$ if $x$ is less than or equal to $y$, but none otherwise.  


* **Monoid** From a category $C$ with a single object $a$
we obtain a monoid $C(a,a)$. Conversely, from any monoid $M$
we can create a category $C$ with a single object $\star$ by putting 
$C(\star,\star):=M$. This shows that the notion of monoid is essentially
equivalent to that of a category with a single object. 
In fact, this is one way to motivate the concept of categories: categories are the [[horizontal categorification|many object version]] of monoids.
It is sometime useful to distinguish between a monoid $M$ and the
associated category with a single object by denoting the latter $\mathbf{B}M$.
The category $\mathbf{B}M$ is often called the _classifying category_ of $M$.

* The [[simplicial category]] $\Delta$ has objects the ordered sets
$[n]=\{0,\ldots,n\}$ for $n\geq 0$, and for morphisms the order
preserving maps $[n]\to [m]$.


## Isomorphisms, Groupoids

### Definition

* A morphism $f:a\to b$ is a category is said to be _inversible_ ,
or to be an _[[isomorphism|isomorphism]]_
if there exists a morphism $h:b\to a$ such that $h f=1_a$ and $f h=1_b$, in which
case $h$ is said to be the _inverse_ of $f$ and we write $h=f^{-1}$
(the inverse is unique when it exists).  The composite
of two isomorphisms $f: a \to b$ and $g:b\to c$
is an isomorphism and we have $(g f)^{-1}=f^{-1}g^{-1}$. 
An endomorphism is said to be an
_[[automorphism|automorphism]]_
if it invertible 
The set of automorphism of an object $a$ has the 
structure of a group called the _group of automorphisms_ of $a$.   

* A _[[groupoid|groupoid]]_ is a category in which every morphism is inversible.


### Examples

* A map $f:S\to T$ in the category of sets [[Set]] is invertible iff it is
_bijective_. 

* An isomorphism in the category [[Top]] is said to be a _homeomorphism_.

* Every type of mathematical structure carries
a notion of isomorphism. Hence the collection of all structures
of a given type form a groupoid. 

* The isomorphisms in a category $C$ form a groupoid $Iso(C)$ 
having the same objects as $C$.


* **Group** A [[group]] is a groupoid with a single object.
The classifying category of a group $G$ is a groupoid
with a single object $\mathbf{B}G$.
In fact, groupoids are the [[horizontal categorification|many object version]] of groups.


## Duality

### Definition
The _opposite_ of a category $C$ is the category $C^o$ obtained
by formally reversing the direction of the arrows of $C$. 
It is sometime useful to make a distinction between the objects
of $C$ and of $C^o$ by denoting $a^o\in C^o$ the object which corresponds
to an object $a\in C$, and by denoting $f^o\in C^o(b^o,a^o)$
the arrow which corresponds to an arrow $f\in C(a,b)$.
If $f\in C(a,b)$ and $g\in C(b,c)$ then
the composite of $g^o\in C(c^o,b^o)$ with $f^o\in C(b^o,a^o)$ is defined 
to be the arrow $(g f)^o\in C^o(c^o,a^o)$. Thus $f^o g^o:=(g f)^o$.


## Functors

### Definition

A _[[functor|functor]]_  $F$ from a category $C$ to a category $D$ is a map sending each object $x \in C$ to an object $F(x) \in D$ and each morphism $f : x \to y$ in $C$ to morphism $F(f) : F(x) \to F(y)$ in $D$, such that

* $F$ preserves [[composition]]: $F(f g) = F(f) F(g)$ whenever the left-hand side is well-defined,

* $F$ preserves [[identity morphisms]]: for each object $x \in X$, $F(1_x) = 1_{F(x)}$.

The composite of two functors $F:C\to D$ and $G:D\to E$ is a functor
$GF:C\to E$. There is also an 
_[[identity functor|identity functor]]_ $I_C:C\to C$
for every category $C$.

* We shall denote by [[Cat]], the _[[Cat|category of small categories]]_: an object of this category is a small category $C$ and an arrow $C\to D$ is a 
functor $F:C\to D$; composition of arrows is defined by composing the 
functors, and the units are the identity functors. The category [[Cat]] is large but locally small.

* A functor $F:C\to D$ induces an opposite functor $F^o:C^o\to D^o$
if we put $F^o(a^o)=F(a)^o$ and $F^o(f^o)=F(f)^o$ for every object $a\in C$
and arrow $f\in C$.

* A _contravariant_ functor $C\to D$ between two categories $C$ and $D$
is defined to be a functor $C^o\to D$. 



### Examples

* A [[forgetful functor]] is a functor which is defined by 'forgetting' something. For example, the forgetful functor from Grp to Set forgets the group structure of a group, remembering only the underlying set.
Another example is the functor from the category of rings Ring to the category of monoids Mon which forgets the additive structure of the ring but
remember its multiplicative structure.

* The integral _homology functor_ $H_n: Top \to Ab$ associates to a topological space $X$ its integral [[homology]] groups of degree $n\geq 0$. 

* The free group functor $F: Set \to Grp$ associates to a set $X$
the group $F(X)$ freely  generated by $X$.

*  A [[simplicial set]] is defined to be a functor $X:\Delta^o\to Sets$.


* If $G$ is a group and $KVect$ is the category of $K$-vector spaces over a field $K$, then a functor $BG\to KVect$ is the same thing as a $K$-linear [[representation]] of $G$. 



### Special properties ##

Functors with special properties are important in applications. 
A functor $F:C\to D$ is said to be

* [[full functor|full]] if the map $C(a,b)\to D(F a,F b)$ induced by $F$ is surjective for every pair of objects $a,b\in C$;

* [[faithful functor|faithful]] if the map $C(a,b)\to D(F a,F b)$ is injective
for every pair of objects $a,b\in C$;


* [[fully faithful functor|fully faithful]] if the map $C(a,b)\to D(F a,F b)$ is bijective for every pair of objects $a,b\in C$;


* [[essentially surjective functor|essentially surjective]] if for every object $y\in D$ there exists an object $x\in C$ together with an isomorphism 
$F(x)\to y$;

* [[equivalence]] if it is fully faithful and essentially surjective;

 

A functor $F:C\to D$ is an [[isomorphism]] iff it is fully faithful and the map $Ob(C)\to Ob(D)$ induced by $F$ is bijective. 

### Natural transformations

The functors between two categories $C$ and $D$ form themselves a category, the [[functor category]] $[C,D]$, whose morphisms are [[natural transformations]]. More precisely,
given two two functors $F, G:C \to D,$ a _natural transformation_ $\alpha:F \to G$ assigns to every [[object]] $x\in C$ a [[morphism]] 
$\alpha_x:F(x) \to G(x)$ in $D$ 
such that for any morphism $f:x \to y$ in $C$, 
the following diagram commutes in $D$:

\[ 
  \array{ 
    F(x) 
    & 
    \stackrel{F(f)}{\to} 
    & 
    F(y) 
    \\ 
    \alpha_x\downarrow 
    && 
    \downarrow \alpha_y 
    \\ G(x) 
    & 
    \stackrel{G(f)}{\to} & G(y) 
  }
  \,. 
\] 

The composite of a natural transformation $\alpha:F\to G$
with a natural transformation $\beta:G\to H$ (between functors $C\to D$)
is the natural transformation $\beta \alpha:F\to H$ defined by
putting $(\beta\alpha)_x=\beta_{x}\alpha_x$.

The functors between two categories $C$ and $D$ form themselves a category, the [[functor category]] $[C,D]$, whose morphisms are [[natural transformations]]. 


* A _map_ of simplicial sets $f:X\to Y$  is defined to be a
natural transformation between the functors $X,Y:\Delta^o\to Set$. 
 



* If $G$ is a group and $KVect$ is the category of $K$-vector spaces over a field $K$, then the functor category $[BG,KVect]$ is isomorphic to the category 
of a $K$-linear [[representation]]s of $G$.
