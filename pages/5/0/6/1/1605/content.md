# Idea #

A **doctrine**, as the word was originally used by [[Jon Beck]], is a [[vertical categorification|categorification]] of a "theory."  Thus, a doctrine could also reasonably be called a "2-theory."

Here we are using the word "theory" in a vague non-precise sense.  For instance, there is a theory of [[group]]s, a theory of [[abelian group]]s, a theory of [[commutative ring]]s, and so on.  Likewise, there is a doctrine of [[monoidal categories]], a doctrine of categories with finite [[product]]s, a doctrine of [[rig categories]], and so on.

Moreover, just as categories are objects of a 2-category (the categorification of a category), ordinary _theories_ are objects of some _doctrine_.  The doctrine in which a theory lives specifies the structure on categories in which models of that theory can be [[internalization|internalized]].  For instance, the theory of groups lives naturally in the doctrine of categories with finite products, since a [[group object]] can be defined in any such category.  Likewise, the theory of [[monoid]]s lives in the doctrine of monoidal categories, and so on.

Moreover, in general there is a "free" category containing a model of some given theory: for instance there is a category with finite products freely generated by a group object (namely, the [[Lawvere theory]] of a group), and a monoidal category freely generated by a monoid object (namely, the [[augmented simplex category]]).  In this way, a theory whose _models_ are categories in some doctrine can itself be regarded as a category in that doctrine, with the property that the category of models of a theory $T$ in a category $K$ is the hom-category $hom(T,K)$ in the relevant doctrine.  In fact, we can fruitfully think of a doctrine _as_ the collection of all theories in that doctrine, since (for example) any category with finite products can be regarded as a "theory" that can be interpreted in any other such category, via finite-product-preserving functors.

For this to make sense, whatever a doctrine is, it must in particular induce a 2-category of its models.  Or, at least, of its models in $Cat$, which is so far all that we have talked about.  But one can also imagine considering 2-theories as objects of some 3-theory, and so on.  (Unfortunately this approach involves us in an infinite regress when we look for a formal definition!)

# Definitions

A number of people, starting with Lawvere, have defined "doctrine" to mean [[2-monad]] (particularly a 2-monad on $Cat$).  This may seem reasonable, since all the examples of doctrines we considered above are, in fact, (the algebras for) some 2-monad on $Cat$.  However, it is not really correct.  At a lower level, the "theories" considered above of which a doctrine is supposed to be a categorification are also _not_ the same as [[monad]]s.

In particular, the morphisms between such theories are not all representable by morphisms of monads.  For instance, there is a morphism of theories from the theory of commutative rings to the theory of abelian groups which sends a ring to its multiplicative group of units, but this is not induced by any morphism of monads because it does not preserve the underlying set.  Likewise, not all "morphisms of doctrines" are representable by morphisms of 2-monads.

(other possible definitions...?)
