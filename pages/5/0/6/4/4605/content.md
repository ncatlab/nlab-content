Given any [[set]] $X$, there is a unique __empty [[family]]__ of elements of $X$.  Formally, this is given by the [[empty function]] to $X$, the unique [[function]] to $X$ from the [[empty set]].  As the empty set is [[finite set|finite]] and (a fortiori) [[countable set|countable]], this empty family counts as a [[list]] (or [[tuple]]) and a [[stream]]; in such a guise it is known as the __empty list__ (or __$0$-tuple__) or the __empty stream__ (or _empty sequence_ if the term 'sequence' is used in a sufficiently general sense).

When treating it as an element of the [[free monoid]] on $X$, the empty list may be written $()$, $*$, or $\epsilon$, perhaps with a subscript $X$ if desired.  (Thinking of all empty lists, regardless of the underlying set, as equal is like thinking of all [[empty subsets]] as equal.)

Besides empty families of elements of sets, we have the notions of the empty family of elements of a given [[proper class]], the empty family of elements of a given [[preset]], the empty family of term of a given [[type]], the empty family of [[objects]] and the empty family of [[morphisms]] of a given [[category]], and more generally the empty family of whatever you want.
