#Idea#

A manifold with boundary is a _cobordism_ between its boundary components.

...

#Categorical formalizations#

* There is an [[(infinity,n)-category of cobordisms]].

* There is a weak cubical category of cobordisms, see [[Cospans in Algebraic Topology]]

* Cobordisms can also naturally thought of as [[cospan]]s in [[Top]]

  * Marco Grandis, _Collared cospans, cohomotopy and TQFT (Cospans in Algebraic Topology II)_ ([pdf](http://www.dima.unige.it/~grandis/wCub2.pdf)) .

  * Accordingly [[extended cobordism]]s can be naturally described by [[multi-cospan]]s or [[hyperstructure]]s.
