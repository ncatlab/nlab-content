## Definition

A **Priestley space** is a [[compact topological space]] with a [[partial order]] $\leq$ which satisfies the *Priestley separation axiom*:

* If $x \nleq y$, then there exists a [[clopen]] [[upper set]] $U$ of $X$ such that $x \in U$ and $y \notin U$. 

## Properties

Every Priestley space is a [[sober topological space]].  Furthermore, every Priestley space is a [[Hausdorff space]] and a [[Stone space]]. 

## Examples

* Every [[finite set|finite]] [[poset]] is a Priestley space. 

## Relation to coherent spaces

\begin{theorem}
Every Priestley space is a coherent space in two different ways: where the [[open set]] [[topology]] are given by the [[upper sets]] or the [[lower sets]] respectively. 
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
Every coherent space is a Priestley space whose topology is given by the topology generated by the [[subbasis]] consisting of [[compact set|compact]] [[open subsets]] and their [[complements]] and whose [[partial order]] is given by the [[specialization order]]. 
\end{theorem}

## Category of Priestley spaces

The category of Priestley spaces is the category whose objects are Priestley spaces and whose morphisms are [[monotonic]] [[continuous functions]] between Priestley spaces. 

The category of Priestley spaces is the [[opposite category]] of [[DistLat]], the category of [[distributive lattices]]. This phenomenon is called **Priestley [[duality]]**, and is a [[Stone duality|Stone-type duality]] akin to the one between [[Stone spaces]] and [[Boolean algebras]] or [[locales]] and [[frames]]. The category of Priestley spaces is thus equivalent to the category of [[coherent spaces]].
