## Idea

[[homotopy type theory|Homotopy type theory]] has [[categorical semantics]] in suitable [[homotopical categories]] which in turn present certain [[(∞,1)-categories]].  The additional structure of type theory corresponds to structure on these homotopical categories that makes them into a certain kind of [[fibration category]], known as a [[type-theoretic fibration category]] or a [[tribe]].

In practice, however, semantic examples of tribes naturally sit inside certain [[Quillen model categories]].  The concept of _type-theoretic model category_ refers to a model category with additional structure that in particular ensures that its subcategory of fibrant objects is a tribe, but also includes additional conditions that make it easier to use model-categorical tools to prove things about the type-theoretic behavior of that tribe.  At present it is not clear whether there is a unique "correct" notion of "type-theoretic model category"; instead there is a range of stronger or weaker hypotheses that are often useful in proofs of this sort.

Regardless, one purpose of the notion(s) is to ensure that all [[(∞,1)-categories]] with sufficient structure can be presented by a type-theoretic model category, and hence provide higher [[categorical semantics]] for [[homotopy type theory]] (without possibly [[univalence]]).  Specifically, every [[locally presentable (∞,1)-category|locally presentable]] [[locally cartesian closed (∞,1)-category]] has a presentation by a type-theoretic model category.  For more on this see also the respective sections at _[[relation between type theory and category theory]]_.

## Definitions

Some of the additional assumptions on a model category $M$ that are often useful to include when constructing semantics of type theory are:

* $M$ is [[right proper]].

* $M$ is a [[locally cartesian closed category]], or at least that pullback along [[fibrations]] has a right adjoint.

* $M$ is [[combinatorial model category|combinatorial]], 

  or at least [[accessible model category|accessible]] 

  or [[cofibrantly generated model category|cofibrantly generated]].

* The cofibrations in $M$ are the monomorphisms; 

  or at least: they are closed under [[limits]], preserved by [[pullbacks]], and all [[monomorphisms]] are [[cofibrations]], 

  or all [[fibrant objects]] are also [[cofibrant objects|cofibrant]].

* Acyclic cofibrations are preserved by pullback along fibrations.

* The underlying category of $M$ is a [[Grothendieck topos]], or even a [[presheaf topos]].

* $M$ is a [[simplicial model category]].

* $M$ is a [[simplicially locally cartesian closed category]].

Definitions in the literature include:

* In [Arndt-Kapulkin](#AK) a "logical model category" was defined to be a model category in which pullback along any fibration has a right adjoint and acyclic cofibrations are preserved by pullback along fibrations.

* In [Shulman 15](#Shulman15) a "type-theoretic model category" was defined to be a right proper model category in which pullback along any fibration has a right adjoint and cofibrations are closed under limits.

* In [Gepner-Kock](#GK) a "combinatorial type-theoretic model category" was defined to be a right proper combinatorial locally cartesian closed model category whose cofibrations are the monomorphisms.

* In [Lumsdaine-Shulman](#LS) a "good model category" was defined to be a simplicial, right proper, simplicially locally cartesian closed model category in which every monomorphism is a cofibration and cofibrations are closed under limits, while an "excellent model category" (no relation to the similarly-named [[excellent model category]]) was defined to be a good model category that is additionally combinatorial.

## Examples

* The [[classical model structure on simplicial sets]] satisfies *all* the above properties, as does the [[injective model structure on simplicial presheaves]].

* Every [[presentable (∞,1)-category|locally presentable]] [[locally Cartesian closed (∞,1)-category]] (by the discussion <a href="locally+cartesian+closed+(∞,1)-category#PresentationTheorem">there</a>) has a presentation by a [[right proper model category|right proper]] [[Cisinski model category]] (a combinatorial model structure on a Grothendieck topos whose cofibrations are the monomorphisms), indeed one whose underlying category is a presheaf topos.  Thus very strong conditions may be assumed without significantly restricting the class of (∞,1)-categories that can be presented.

* Another (counter-)example to keep in mind, however, is the [[canonical model structure on groupoids]], which is combinatorial and simplicial, all objects are fibrant and cofibrant, pullback along fibrations has a right adjoint, cofcibrations are closed under limits, and all monomorphisms are cofibrations; but the category $Gpd$ is not locally cartesian closed (hence not a Grothendieck topos), and not every cofibration is a monomorphism.

* The [[type-theoretic model structure]] on the presheaves on a small category with an [[atomic object|atomic]] [[interval object]]. This gives examples on various type of cartesian [[cubical sets]].

## Properties

### Modeling type theory

(cf. [[categorical semantics of dependent types]])

* Since fibrations are closed under composition, $M$ always models [[Σ-types]].

* If cofibrations are preserved by pullback (such as if they are the monomorphisms), then acyclic cofibrations are preserved by pullback along fibrations if and only if $M$ is right proper.  And by adjointness, if pullback $f^*$ along any fibration $f$ has a right adjoint $f_*$, then acyclic cofibrations are preserved by pullback along fibrations if and only if the functors $f_*$ (for $f$ a fibration) preserve fibrations.  This implies that $M$ models [[Π-types]].

* These $\Pi$-types satisfy [[function extensionality]] if and only if $f_*$ also preserves acyclic fibrations, or equivalently if $f^*$ preserves cofibrations ([Shulman 15, lemma 5.9](#Shulman15)).  In particular, if $M$ is right proper, cofibrations are preserved by pullback, and pullback along any fibration has a right adjoint, then $M$ models $\Pi$-types with function exensionality.

* If acyclic cofibrations are preserved by pullback along fibrations, then for any map $f:x\to y$ between fibrant objects, the functor $f^*: M/y \to M/x$ preserves acyclic cofibrations between fibrant objects of $M/y$ (i.e. fibrations over $y$); see e.g. [Shulman 17, lemma 7.2](#Shulman17) (originally due to Joyal).  This "Frobenius condition" implies that the [[path objects]] of $M$ model [[identity types]].

* [Lumsdaine-Shulman](#LS) shows that an excellent model category (in their sense, see above) models a wide class of [[higher inductive types]].

### Model-categorical constructions

* By [Gepner-Kock, Proposition 7.8](#GK), a [[semi-left-exact reflection|semi-left-exact]] [[left Bousfield localization]] of a combinatorial type-theoretic model category (in their sense, see above) is again a combinatorial type-theoretic model category.

### A warning

In general one wants to think of the interpretation of type theory in the underlying [[tribe]] of a type-theoretic model category as "living in" the $(\infty,1)$-category presented by the model category.  However, this is not automatic merely from the fact that the subcategory of fibrant objects in a model category is a tribe; one needs some stronger conditions such as those above to ensure that the 1-categorical constructions present the relevant $\infty$-categorical ones.

For instance, in [Bordg 17](#Bordg17) it is shown that the category of fibrant objects in the [[projective model structure]] on the category of [[groupoids]] with $\mathbb{Z}/2$-action is a tribe with $\Pi$-types and a universe, but that the universe fails to be [[univalence axiom|univalent]] and indeed that [[function extensionality]] fails to hold, even though the $(\infty,1)$-category presented by this model structure is locally cartesian closed and has an [[object classifier]] for discrete objects.

Generally one wants at least to require that all fibrant objects are cofibrant, in order that the underlying tribe of fibrant objects has the same [[simplicial localization]] as the model category itself.
