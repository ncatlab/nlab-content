## Idea

In [[linear logic]]/[[linear type theory]], one of the two linear versions of [[logical conjunction]] is called the _multiplicative conjunction_ and usually denoted "$\otimes$".  The analogous connective in [[relevance logic]] is sometimes called the _intensional conjunction_ or the _fusion_ or _cotenability_, and sometimes denoted "$\circ$".

The [[categorical semantics]] of the multiplicative conjunction is as the [[tensor product]] with respect to a ([[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]]) [[monoidal category]] structure on the collection of [[types]].

There are various [[fragments]] of [[linear logic]] that contain the multiplicative conjunction.  For instance, _[[multiplicative linear logic]]_ (MLL) contains $\otimes$ along with its unit $\mathbf{1}$ and also the [[multiplicative disjunction]] $\parr$ and its unit $\bot$ and the linear [[negation]] $(-)^\bot$.  While _multiplicative intuitionistic linear logic_ (MILL)  contains $\otimes$ and $\mathbf{1}$ along with the linear implication $\multimap$.
