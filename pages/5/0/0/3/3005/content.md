## Statement

###### Theorem
**(Beck's monadicity theorem**,  **tripleability theorem)** 

A [[functor]] $U : D \rightarrow C$ is [[monadic]] (tripleable) if and only if

1. $U$ has a [[left adjoint]], and
1. $U$ [[created limit|creates]] [[coequalizers]] of $U$-split pairs.

=--

A proof is reproduced at ([Borceux, vol 2, theorem 4.4.4](#Borceux)).

Here a [[parallel pair]] $f,g : a \rightarrow b$ in $D$ is **$U$-split** if the pair $U f, U g$ has a [[split coequalizer]] in $C$.  Specifically, this means that there is a diagram in $C$: 

$$U a \;\underoverset{U f}{U g}{\rightrightarrows}\; U b \;\overset{h}{\rightarrow}\; c$$

where $h$ has a [[section]] $s$ and $U f$ has a section $t$ such that $U g \cdot t = s \cdot h$.  This implies that the arrow $h$ is necessarily a coequalizer of $U f$ and $U g$.  To say that $U$ *creates coequalizers of $U$-split pairs* is to say that for any such $U$-split pair, there exists a coequalizer $e$ of $f,g$ in $D$ which is preserved by $U$, and moreover any fork in $D$ whose image in $C$ is a split coequalizer must itself be a coequalizer (not necessarily split).

An equivalent, and sometimes easier, way to state these conditions is to say that

###### Theorem

A functor $U : D \to C$ is monadic precisely if

1. $U$ has a [[left adjoint]],
1. $U$ reflects [[isomorphisms]] (i.e. it is [[conservative functor|conservative]]), and
1. $D$ has, and $U$ [[preserved limit|preserves]], coequalizers of $U$-split pairs.

=--


This is equivalent because a conservative functor [[reflected limit|reflects]] any limits or colimits which exist in its domain and which it [[preserved limit|preserves]], while monadic functors are always conservative.

## Variations

### The crude monadicity theorem

The __crude monadicity theorem__ gives a *sufficient*, but not necessary, condition for a functor to be monadic.  It states that a functor $U : D \rightarrow C$ is [[monadic]] if

1. $U$ has a left adjoint
2. $U$ reflects isomorphisms
3. $D$ has and $U$ preserves coequalizers of [[reflexive coequalizer|reflexive pairs]].

(Recall that a parallel pair $f,g : a \rightarrow b$ is __reflexive__ if $f$ and $g$ have a common [[section]].)  This sufficient, but not necessary, condition is sometimes easier to verify in practice.  In contrast to the crude monadicity theorem, the necessary and sufficient condition above is sometimes called the __precise monadicity theorem__.

### Duskin's monadicity theorem

Duskin's monadicity theorem gives a different sufficient, but not necessary, condition which refers only to quotients of [[congruences]].  It says that a functor $U \colon D \to C$ is monadic if

1. $U$ has a left adjoint
1. $D$ and $C$ are [[finitely complete category|finitely complete]]
1. $U$ [[created limit|creates]] coequalizers for [[congruences]] in $D$ whose images in $C$ have split coequalizers.

We can weaken the hypothesis a bit further to obtain the theorem:

* A right adjoint between finitely complete categories is monadic if it creates [[quotients]] for [[congruences]].

As usual, we can also modify it by replacing reflection of limits by reflection of isomorphisms.

* A conservative right adjoint $U\colon D \to C$ between finitely complete categories is monadic if any congruence in $D$ which has a quotient in $C$ already has a quotient in $D$, and that quotient that is preserved by $U$.

If we view the objects of $D$ as underlying $C$-objects with structure, this says that any congruence in $D$ induces a $D$-structure on its quotient in $C$.  As with the crude monadicity theorem, this condition is sometimes easier to verify since quotients of congruences are often better-behaved than arbitrary coequalizers.  This is the case in many "algebraic" situations.

Duskin actually gave a slightly more precise version only assuming the categories $C$ and $D$ to have particular finite limits, rather than all of them.

### Monadicity over Set

In the case when the base category $C$ is [[Set]], one can further refine the requisite conditions.  Linton proved that a functor $U\colon D\to Set$ is monadic if and only if

1. $U$ has a left adjoint,
1. $D$ admits [[kernel pairs]] and [[coequalizers]],
1. A [[parallel pair]] $R \rightrightarrows S$ in $D$ is a kernel pair if and only if its image under $U$ is so, and
1. A morphism $A\to B$ in $D$ is a [[regular epimorphism]] if and only if its image under $U$ is so.

There are other versions of this theorem, including generalizations to monadicity over [[presheaf categories]], which can be viewed as analogues of [[Giraud's theorem]].

### Strict monadicity

The version of the monadicity theorem given in [[Categories Work]] uses an [[evil]] notion of "creation of limits" and concludes that the comparison functor is an *isomorphism* of categories, rather than merely an equivalence.  But the versions mentioned above can be found in the exercises. 

Note however that if $U: D \to C$ is an [[amnestic functor|amnestic]] [[isofibration]], then $U$ is monadic iff it is strictly monadic. For an application of this observation, see for example the discussion of algebraically free monads at [[free monad]]. 

## Examples and Applications

### Groups over sets

We will use Duskin's variant to prove that the [[forgetful functor]] $U\colon$[[Grp]]$\to$[[Set]] is monadic.  Of course, this is also easy to show by explicit computation, but it serves as a useful example of how to use a monadicity theorem.  We first need it to have a left adjoint: this is easy to show by a direct construction of [[free groups]], but we could also invoke the [[adjoint functor theorem]].  It is also easy to show that it is conservative (a bijective group homomorphism is a group isomorphism), so it remains to consider congruences.

Since limits in $Grp$ are created in $Set$, a [[congruence]] in $Grp$ on a group $G$ is an [[equivalence relation]] on $G$ which is also a [[subgroup]] of $G\times G$.  This latter condition means that if $g_1\sim g_2$ and $h_1\sim h_2$, then also $g_1^{-1}\sim g_2^{-1}$ and $g_1 h_1 \sim g_2 h_2$.  Since $g\sim g$ for all $g$, it follows that $g\sim h$ if and only if $1\sim h g^{-1}$, so $\sim$ is determined by the subset $H\subseteq G$ of those $h\in G$ such that $1\sim h$.  This $H$ is clearly a subgroup of $G$, and moreover a [[normal subgroup]], since if $h\in H$ and $g\in G$ we have $1 = g^{-1} g \sim g^{-1} h g$, so $g^{-1} h g\in H$.  Conversely, it is easy to construct a congruence from any normal subgroup, so the two notions are equivalent.  It remains only to observe that the quotient of a group by a normal subgroup is, in fact, a quotient of its associated congruence in $Grp$, which is preserved by $U$.  Thus, by Duskin's monadicity theorem, $U$ is monadic.

### Categories over computads

The monadicity theorem becomes more important when the base category $C$ is more complicated and harder to work with explicitly, and when the objects of $D$ are not obviously defined as "objects of $C$ with extra structure."  For instance, the category of [[strict 2-categories]] is monadic over the category of 2-[[globular sets]], essentially by definition, but it is much less trivial to show that it is *also* monadic over the category of [[2-computads]].  This latter fact can, however, be proven using the monadicity theorem.

### Monadic descent

The monadicity theorem also plays a central role in [[monadic descent]].

## In $(\infty,1)$-categories

There is a version of the monadicity theorem for [[(∞,1)-monad]]s in [section 3.4](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/math/pdf/0702/0702299v5.pdf#page=107) of
