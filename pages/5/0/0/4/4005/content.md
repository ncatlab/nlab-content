The Hawaiian earring space is a famous counterexample in topology which shows the need for care in hypotheses to develop a good theory of covering spaces. It is an example of a space which is not [[semi-locally simply connected space|semi-locally simply connected]]. 

It is defined to be the set 

$$\{(x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^2: (x - 1/2^n)^2 + y^2 = 1/2^{2n}\}$$

endowed with subspace topology inherited from $\mathbb{R}^2$. Every neighborhood of $(0, 0)$ has non-contractible loops inside it (this would not be the case under the CW topology, where the result would be a countable bouquet of circles).
