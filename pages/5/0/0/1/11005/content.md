## Idea

Given a [[morphism]] of [[discrete]] [[commutative rings]], $\phi:A\to B$, one is often interested in computing the [[Amitsur cohomology]] with respect to $\phi$. This is the dualization of [[Cech cohomology]] for a morphism of spaces, except it takes place before applying a "Spec" functor to the rings. Often, the Amitsur cohomology of a morphism of rings, especially with coefficients in some $B$-module, contains useful information regarding [[descent]] along $\phi$.  

## Examples

* The (unstable) [[Adams spectral sequence]] is an example for descent along $Spec(E) \to Spec(R)$. (...) ([Hess 10, section 5.3](#Hess10))
