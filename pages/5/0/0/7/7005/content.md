## Idea

In [[intensional type theory]], [[identity types]] behave like [[path space objects]]; this viewpoint is called [[homotopy type theory]].  This induces furthermore a notion of [[homotopy fibers]], hence of [[homotopy equivalence]]s between [[types]].

On the other hand, if type theory contains a [[universe]] [[Type]], so that types can be considered as *points* of $Type$, then between two types we also have an [[identity type]] $Paths_{Type}(X,Y)$.  The _univalence axiom_ says that these two notions of "sameness" for types are the same.  

Extensionality principles like [[function extensionality]], [[propositional extensionality]] (where $X$ and $Y$ are [[h-propositions]], and univalence ("typal extensionality") are naturally regarded as a stronger form of _[[identity of indiscernibles]]_. In particular, the [[consistency]] of univalence means that in [[Martin-Löf type theory]] without univalence, one cannot define any [[predicate]] that provably distinguishes isomorphic [[types]]; thus isomorphic types are "externally indiscernible", and univalence incarnates that principle internally by making them identical.

The name *univalence* (due to Voevodsky) comes from the following reasoning.  A fibration or bundle $p\colon E\to B$ of some sort is commonly said to be *universal* if every other bundle of the same sort is a pullback of $p$ in a unique way (up to homotopy).  Less commonly, a bundle is said to be *versal* if every other bundle is a pullback of it in *some* way, not necessarily unique.  By contrast, a bundle is said to be *univalent* if every other bundle is a pullback of it in *at most one* way (up to homotopy).  In the language of [[(∞,1)-category]] theory, a univalent bundle is an [[object classifier]].

The univalence axiom does not *literally* say that anything is univalent in this sense.  However, it is *equivalent* to saying that the canonical fibration over $Type$ is univalent: every fibration with _small_ fibers is an essentially unique pullback of this one (while those with large fibers are not, they are pullbacks of the next higher $Type_1$).  For a description of this equivalence, see section 4.8 of the [[HoTT Book]] (syntactically) and [Gepner-Kock](#GepnerKock12) (semantically).

Univalence is a commonly assumed [[axiom]] in [[homotopy type theory]], and is central to the proposal ([Voevodsky](#Voevodsky)) that this provides a natively [[homotopy theory|homotopy theoretic]] [[foundation]] of [[mathematics]] (see at _[[univalent foundations for mathematics]]_).

## Definition

We work in a [[dependent type theory]] with [[identity types]], [[function types]], [[dependent product types]], [[product types]], and [[dependent sum types]]. 

There are multiple notions of [[equivalence types]] in [[dependent type theory]], which can be used for a definition of univalence for a [[type universe]] $U$; these include

* [[definitional isomorphism types]]
* various notions of (weak) [[equivalence types]]
  * the type of [[functions]] with [[contractible type|contractible]] [[fiber type|fibers]]
  * the type of [[spans]] with contractible fibers
  * the type of [[multivalued partial functions]] which are single-valued and [[total function|total]] and have contractible fibers
  * the type of [[one-to-one correspondences]]
* type of $U$-small equivalences, given a type universe $U$ and a definition of equivalence above

Let us assume an arbitrary notion of equivalence type $\simeq_0$. Every [[Russell universe]] $U$ is a [[reflexive graph]] with the graph type family $R(A, B)$ defined as $R(A, B) \coloneqq A \simeq_0 B$ and the function $\mathrm{idtofam}(A, B)$ is defined as 

$$\mathrm{idtofam}(A, B) \coloneqq \mathrm{idtoequiv}(A, B)$$

Similarly, every [[Tarski universe]] $U$ with universal type family $T$ is a [[reflexive graph]] with the graph type family $R(A, B)$ defined as $R(A, B) \coloneqq T(A) \simeq_0 T(B)$ and the function $\mathrm{idtofam}(A, B)$ is defined as 

$$\mathrm{idtofam}(A, B) \coloneqq \mathrm{transport}^T(A, B)$$

And finally, every [[Tarski universe]] $U$ with type of terms $T$ and function $\mathrm{typeof}:T \to U$ is a reflexive graph with the graph type family $R(A, B)$ defined as 

$$R(A, B) \coloneqq \left(\sum_{t:T} \mathrm{typeOf}(t) =_U A\right) \simeq \left(\sum_{t:T} \mathrm{typeOf}(t) =_U B\right)$$

and the function $\mathrm{idtofam}(A, B)$ is defined as 

$$\mathrm{idtofam}(A, B) \coloneqq \mathrm{transport}^{\sum_{t:T} \mathrm{typeOf}(t) =_U (-)}(A, B)$$

Now, let us assume an arbitrary notion of equivalence type $\simeq$. A Russell or Tarski universe is **univalent** if it is [[univalent reflexive graph|univalent]] as a [[reflexive graph]], or equivalently, if one of the following equivalent conditions by the [[fundamental theorem of identity types]] hold:

1. That for each $x:A$ the type of elements $y:A$ such that $R(x, y)$ is a [[contractible type]]. 
$$x:A \vdash \mathrm{ua}(x):\mathrm{isContr}\left(\sum_{y:A} R(x, y)\right)$$

1. That there is a family of equivalences 
$$x:A, y:A \vdash \mathrm{ua}(x, y):(x =_A y) \simeq R(x, y)$$

1. That $R(x, y)$ is an [[identity system]]. 

1. That for each $x:A$ and $y:A$, the function $\mathrm{idtofam}(x, y)$ is an [[equivalence of types]]
$$x:A, y:A, \vdash \mathrm{ua}(x, y):\mathrm{isEquiv}(\mathrm{idtofam}(x, y))$$

1. That $\mathrm{idtofam}(x, y)$ is a [[retraction]] (This is due to [[Daniel Licata]] in [Licata 16](#Licata16))
$$x:A, y:A \vdash \mathrm{ua}(x, y):R(x, y) \to (x =_A y)$$
$$x:A, y:A, r:R(x, y) \vdash G(x, y):\mathrm{idtofam}(x, y, \mathrm{ua}(x, y, r)) =_{R(x, y)} r$$

1. That $R(x, y)$ with the function $\mathrm{idtofam}(x, y)$ satisfies the [[universal property]] of the [[unary sum]] of $x =_A y$. 

See [[fundamental theorem of identity types]] for proofs that these definitions are the same. 

Traditional [[homotopy type theory]] uses the type of functions with contractible fibers for both $\simeq$ and $R$, while [[Mike Shulman]]'s model of [[higher observational type theory]] uses the type of $U$-small one-to-one correspondences for $R$ and the type of [[definitional isomorphisms]] for $\simeq$. 

### Stricter versions of univalence

There are stricter versions of univalence, where we replace the [[equivalence of types]] between the identity type $A =_U B$ and the type of equivalences of the universe $A \simeq B$ in the univalence axioms with some notion of [[equality]], such as [[judgmental equality]], [[propositional equality]], and [[typal equality]]. 

1. In any [[dependent type theory]] with [[judgmental equality]], given a [[type universe]] $U$, one could replace the equivalence of types in the definition of univalence with a [[judgmental equality]] of types. This results in **judgmental univalence**, which states that for all small types $A:U$ and $B:U$, one could judge that $(A =_U B) \equiv (A \simeq B) \; \mathrm{type}$.

2. Similarly, in the context of any [[logic over type theory]] with [[propositional equality]], given a [[type universe]] $U$, one could replace the equivalence of types in the definition of univalence with a [[propositional equality]] of types. This results in **propositional univalence**, which states that for all small types $A:U$ and $B:U$, $(A =_U B) \equiv (A \simeq B) \; \mathrm{true}$.

3. Finally, if we are working inside a [[Tarski universe]] $(\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{T})$, then given an internal [[Tarski universe]] $U:\mathcal{V}$ with $T:\mathcal{T}(U) \to \mathcal{V}$, one could replace the equivalence of types in the definition of univalence with a [[typal equality]] of types. This results in **typal univalence**, which states that for all small types $A:\mathcal{T}(U)$ and $B:\mathcal{T}(U)$, there is an [[identification]] $\mathrm{ua}(A, B):(T(A) =_U T(B)) =_{\mathcal{V}} (T(A) \simeq_{\mathcal{V}} T(B))$.

Each of these imply the usual versions of univalence either through the structural rules for [[judgmental equality]] and [[propositional equality]], or through [[identification elimination]], [[transport]], and [[action on identifications]] for [[typal equality]]. 

### Rules for judgmentally univalent universes

With judgmentally univalent Tarski universes $(U, T)$, identities $p:A =_U B$ are [[equivalences of types]] $A$ and $B$. Namely, given [[function types]] and the [[isEquiv]] type family, one could add rules to the type theory which says that $A =_U B$ behaves as an [[equivalence type]]:

Introduction rules:
$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A:U \quad \Gamma \vdash B:U \quad \Gamma, x:T[A/X] \vdash f:T[B/X] \quad \Gamma \vdash y:\mathrm{isEquiv}(f)}{\Gamma \vdash \mathrm{equiv}(f, y):A =_U B}$$

Elimination rules:
$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A:U \quad \Gamma \vdash B:U \quad \Gamma, x:T[A/X] \vdash f:T[B/X] \quad \Gamma, z:A =_U B \vdash C \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma, x:T[A/X], f:T[B/X], y:\mathrm{isEquiv}(f) \vdash c:C[\mathrm{equiv}(f, y)/z]}{\Gamma, z:A =_U B \vdash \mathrm{ind}_{A =_U B}^C(c):C}$$

Computation rules:
$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A:U \quad \Gamma \vdash B:U \quad \Gamma, x:T[A/X] \vdash f:T[B/X] \quad \Gamma, z:A =_U B \vdash C \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma, x:T[A/X], f:T[B/X], y:\mathrm{isEquiv}(f) \vdash c:C[\mathrm{equiv}(f, y)/z]}{\Gamma, x:T[A/X], f:T[B/X], y:\mathrm{isEquiv}(f) \vdash \beta_{A =_U B}^C(c):\mathrm{ind}_{A =_U B}^C(c)[\mathrm{equiv}(f, y)/z] =_{C[\mathrm{equiv}(f, y)/z]} c}$$

Uniqueness rules:
$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A:U \quad \Gamma \vdash B:U \quad \Gamma, x:T[A/X] \vdash f:T[B/X] \quad \Gamma, z:A =_U B \vdash C \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma, x:T[A/X], f:T[B/X], y:\mathrm{isEquiv}(f) \vdash c:C[\mathrm{equiv}(f, y)/z] \quad \Gamma, z:A =_U B \vdash u:C \quad \Gamma, x:T[A/X], f:T[B/X], y:\mathrm{isEquiv}(f) \vdash i_\mathrm{in}(u):u[\mathrm{equiv}(f, y)/z] =_{C[\mathrm{in}(x, y)/z]} c}{\Gamma, e:A =_U B \vdash \eta_{A =_U B}^C(c):u[e/z] =_{C[e/z]} \mathrm{ind}_{A =_U B}^C(c)[e/z]}$$

### Weaker versions of univalence

In the context of [[function extensionality]], Ian Orton and Andrew Pitts showed [here](http://types2017.elte.hu/proc.pdf#page=93) that the univalence axiom can be simplified to the following special cases:

   * $unit : A = \sum_{a:A} 1$
   * $flip : (\sum_{a:A} \sum_{b:B} C(a,b)) = (\sum_{b:B} \sum_{a:A} C(a,b))$
   * $contract: IsContr(A) \to (A=1)$
   * $unit_\beta : coe(unit(a)) = (a,\star)$
   * $flip_\beta : coe(flip(a,b,c)) = (b,a,c)$.

   The proof constructs $ua(f): A=B$ (for $f:A\simeq B$) as the composite
   $$ A \overset{unit}{=} \sum_{a:A} 1 \overset{contract}{=} \sum_{a:A} \sum_{b:B} f a=b \overset{flip}{=} \sum_{b:B} \sum_{a:A} f a = b \overset{contract}{=} \sum_{b:B} 1 \overset{unit}{=} B $$
   and uses $unit_\beta$ and $flip_\beta$ to compute that $coe(ua(f))(a) = f(a)$, hence by function extensionality $coe(ua(f)) = f$.

This is weaker than univalence because in the absense of [[function extensionality]], it is no longer possible to prove univalence from this set of axioms. 

In addition, unlike the definitions above, this definition of univalence cannot be generalized to [[reflexive graphs]]. 

### Internal univalence

Suppose the [[Tarski universe]] $U$ has 

* internal identity types 
$$\mathrm{Id}^U:\prod_{A:U} T(A) \times T(A) \to U$$
* internal dependent product types 
$$\Pi_U (x:(-)).(-)(x):\left(U \times \prod_{A:U} T(A) \to U\right) \to U$$ 
* internal dependent sum types 
$$\Sigma_U (x:(-)).(-)(x):\left(U \times \prod_{A:U} T(A) \to U\right) \to U$$ 

We assume the weakest notion of Tarski universe, where the type reflection $T(A)$ of each $A:U$ is only equivalent to the external type, since (judgmentally, propositionally, typally) strict Tarski universes are weakly Tarski universes, because the [[judgmental equality]] and [[propositional equality]] imply equivalence of types by the structural rules for judgmental and propostional equality, and [[typal equality]] in a [[type universe]] of types imply equivalence of types by [[identification elimination]], [[transport]], and [[action on identifications]]. 

This allows us to define the internal type of equivalences $A \simeq_U^\mathrm{in} B$, internal to the universe $U$, which comes with a canonical equivalence of types
$$\mathrm{canonical}_\simeq(A, B):T(A \simeq_U^\mathrm{in} B) \simeq (T(A) \simeq T(B))$$ 
This implies that the equivalence $T(A) \simeq T(B)$ is $U$-small, and [[transport]] being an [[equivalence]] then implies that in any universe $U$ which is closed under [[function types]], [[dependent product types]], and [[dependent sum types]], for all $A:U$ and $B:U$, the [[identity type]] $A =_U B$ is $U$-small. 

The internal univalence axiom states that the canonical function 
$$\mathrm{idtointernalequiv}(A, B):(A =_U B) \to T(A \simeq_U^\mathrm{in} B)$$
is an equivalence of types
$$\mathrm{idtoequiv}(A, B):(A =_U B) \simeq T(A \simeq_U^\mathrm{in} B)$$

This is not definable for [[strongly predicative]] [[type universes]], since [[strongly predicative]] [[type universes]] are by definition not closed under [[dependent product types]]. 

In addition, the internal and external versions of univalence imply each other. In order to show that the two axioms imply each other, we need to show that there is an [[identification]] 
$$i(p):\mathrm{canonical}_\simeq(A, B)(\mathrm{idtoequiv}(A, B)(p)) =_{T(A) \simeq T(B)}  \mathrm{trans}^{T}(A, B)(p)$$
for all identifications $p:A =_U B$. By the [[J rule]] it is enough to show that $\mathrm{canonical}_\simeq(A, A)$ maps the identity equivalence of $T(A \simeq_U^\mathrm{in} A)$ to the identity equivalence in $T(A) \simeq T(A)$. Since the identity equivalence in $T(A \simeq_U^\mathrm{in} A)$ is just the [[identity function]] $\mathrm{canonical}_\simeq^{-1}(A, A)(\lambda x.x)$ the above statement is always true. Thus, if the universe is closed under [[identity types]], [[dependent product types]], and [[dependent sum types]] the two univalence axioms imply each other and both define the same notion of univalent universe. 

## In categorical semantics
 {#InCategoricalSemantics}

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[locally cartesian closed model category]] in which all objects are cofibrant. 

By the [[categorical semantics]] of [[homotopy type theory]], a [[dependent type]]

$$
  b : B \vdash E(b) : Type
$$

corresponds to a [[morphism]] $E \to B$ in $\mathcal{C}$ that is a [[fibration]] between fibrant objects.

Then the [[dependent type|dependent]] [[function type]]

$$
  b_1, b_2 : B \vdash ( E(b_1) \to E(b_2)) : Type
$$

is interpreted as the [[internal hom]] $[-,-]_{\mathcal{C}/_{B \times B}}$ in the [[slice category]] $\mathcal{C}/_{B \times B}$ after extending $E$ to the [[context]] $B \times B$ by pulling back along the two projections $p_1, p_2 : B \times B \to B$, respectively. Hence this is interpreted as

$$
  [p_1^* E \, , \, p_2^* E]_{\mathcal{C}/_{B \times B}}
  \simeq
  [E \times B \, , \, B \times E]_{\mathcal{C}/_{B \times B}}
  \in 
  \mathcal{C}/_{B \times B}
  \,.
$$

Consider then the [[diagonal]] morphism $\Delta_B : B \to B \times B$  in $\mathcal{C}$ as an object of $\mathcal{C}/_{B \times B}$.  We would like to define a morphism 
$$ q \colon \Delta_B \to [E \times B , B \times E]_{\mathcal{C}/_{B \times B}} \,.$$
in $\mathcal{C}/_{B \times B}$.  By the defining ([[product]] $\dashv$ [[internal hom]])-[[adjunction]], it suffices to define a morphism
$$ \Delta_B \times_{\mathcal{C}/_{B \times B}} E \times B \to B \times E $$
in $\mathcal{C}/_{B \times B}$.  But now by the 
[[universal property]] of [[pullback]], it suffices to define just in $\mathcal{C}_{/B}$ a morphism
$$ \Delta_B \times_{\mathcal{C}/_{B \times B}} E \times B \to \Delta_B \times_{\mathcal{C}/_{B \times B}} B \times E\,. $$  
And since the composite pullback along either composite
$$ B \xrightarrow{\Delta_B} B\times B \xrightarrow{\pi_1} B$$
$$ B \xrightarrow{\Delta_B} B\times B \xrightarrow{\pi_2} B$$
is the identity, both $\Delta_B \times_{\mathcal{C}/_{B \times B}} E \times B$ and $\Delta_B \times_{\mathcal{C}/_{B \times B}} B \times E$ are isomorphic to $E$; thus here we can take the [[identity]] morphism.

Now, using the [[path object]] factorization in $\mathcal{C}$

$$
  \array{
     B &&\stackrel{\simeq}{\hookrightarrow}&& B^I
     \\
     & {}_{\mathllap{\Delta_B}}\searrow
     && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{}}
     \\
     && B \times B
  }
$$

by an acyclic cofibration followed by a fibration, we obtain a fibrant replacement of $\Delta_B$ in the [[slice model category]] $\mathcal{C}_{B \times B}$.

Since also $[E \times B, B \times E]_{\mathcal{C}/_{B \times B}}$ is fibrant by the axioms on the [[locally cartesian closed model category]] $\mathcal{C}$, we have a 
lift $\hat q$ in the [[diagram]] in $\mathcal{C}/_{B \times B}$

$$
  \array{
    B &\stackrel{q}{\to}& [E \times B, B \times E]_{\mathcal{C}/_{B \times B}}
   \\
   \downarrow &{}^{\mathllap{\hat q}}\nearrow& \downarrow
   \\
   B^I &\to& B \times B = *_{\mathcal{C}/_{B \times B}}
  } 
  \,.
$$

This lift is the interpretation of the [[identity type|path induction]] that deduces a map on all paths $\gamma \in B^I$ from one on just the identity paths $id_b \in B \hookrightarrow B^I$.


Finally, let $Eq(E) \hookrightarrow [E \times B , B \times E]_{\mathcal{C}/_{B \times B}}$ be the [[subobject]]  on the weak equivalences (...), and observe that $q$ and $\hat q$ factor through this to give a morphism

$$
  \hat q : B^I \to Eq(E)
  \,.
$$

The fibration $E \to B$ is **univalent** in $\mathcal{C}$ if this morphism is a weak equivalence.  By the [[2-out-of-3 property]], of course, it is equivalent to ask that $q\colon B\to Eq(E)$ be a weak equivalence.

(...)

### In simplicial sets
 {#InSimplicialSets}

We specialize the [general discussion](#InCategoricalSemantics) above to the realization in $\mathcal{C} = $ [[sSet]], equipped with the 
standard [[model structure on simplicial sets]].

For $E \to B$ any fibration ([[Kan fibration]])
between fibrant objects ([[Kan complexes]]),
consider first the simplicial set

$$
  [E \times B , B \times E]_{B \times B}
  \in 
  sSet/_{B \times B} 
$$

defined as the [[internal hom]] in the [[slice category]] $sSet/_{B \times B}$.

Notice that the vertices of this simplicial set over 
a fixed pair $(b_1, b_2) : * \to B \times B$ of vertices in $B$ form the set of morphisms $E_{b_1} \to E_{b_2}$ between the [[fibers]] in $sSet$.

This is because -- by the defining property of the [[internal hom]] in the [[slice category|slice]] and using that [[products]] in $sSet/_{B \times B}$ are [[pullbacks]] in $sSet$ -- the horizontal morphisms of simplcial sets in

$$
  \array{
    * &&\to&& [E \times B, B \times E]_{B \times B}
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{(b_1,b_2)}}\searrow && \swarrow
    \\
    && B \times B
  }
$$

correspond bijectively to the horizontal morphisms in

$$
  \array{
    E_{b_1} \times \{b_2\} &&\to&& \{b_1\} \times E_{b_2}
    \\
    & \searrow && \swarrow
    \\
    && B \times B
  }
$$

in $sSet$, which are precisely morphisms $E_{b_1} \to E_{b_2}$.

Let then 

$$
  Eq(E) \hookrightarrow [E \times B, B \times E]_{B \times B}
  \in sSet/_{B \times B}
$$

be the full sub-simplicial set on those vertices that correspond to 
[[weak equivalences]]
(([[weak homotopy equivalence|weak]]) [[homotopy equivalences]]).

By a similar consideration, one sees that the [[diagonal]] morphism
$\Delta_B : B \to B \times B$ in $sSet$, regarded as an object  $B \in sSet/_{B \times B}$, comes with a canonical morphism

$$
  B \to Eq(E)
  \,.
$$

The fibration $E \to B$ is univalent, precisely when this morphism is  a weak equivalence.

This appears originally as [Voevodsky, def. 3.4](#UnivalentFoundationsProject)

### In simplicial presheaves
  {#InSimplicialPresheaves}

(...)

See ([Shulman 12](#Shulman12), [UF 13](UF13))

(...)

## Properties

### Relation to function extensionality

The univalence axiom implies [[function extensionality]].

A commented version of a formal proof of this fact can be found in ([Bauer-Lumsdaine](#BauerLumsdaine)).

### Univalence and axiom K

In this section we assume that the universe is a Tarski universe. [[Axiom K]] states that for all $A:U$ the type $T(A)$ is a set. This means the type reflection of the internal equivalences $T(A \simeq_U B)$ is an [[h-set]], and the univalence axiom then implies that $U$ is an [[h-groupoid]]. 

It is frequently stated that the univalence axiom and axiom K are inconsistent with each other. However, this is only true if the Tarski universe $U$ has internal univalent Tarski universes $V:U$ where the type $T(V)$ has terms $A:T(V)$ such that $T_V(A)$ is an [[h-set]] which is not an [[h-proposition]], such as the [[booleans type]]. As a result, $T(V)$ can be proven to not be a set, causing axiom K for $U$ to be inconsistent with the existence of $V:U$ and univalence. 

### Univalence and excluded middle
 {#UnivalenceLEM}
 {#UnivalenceExcludedMiddle}

The [[univalence axiom]] is consistent with [[excluded middle]]. This is because the principle of excluded middle as traditionally defined in mathematics is about [[propositions]] or [[(-1)-truncated]] types. 
$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type}}{\Gamma \vdash \mathrm{lem}_A:\mathrm{isProp}(A) \to (A \vee (A \to \emptyset))}$$
The semantics of dependent type theory with excluded middle and universes satisfying the univalence axiom are [[boolean topos|boolean]] [[(infinity,1)-topos|$(\infty, 1)$-toposes]]. 

However, there is a global choice axiom which is inconsistent with univalence:
$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type}}{\Gamma \vdash \mathrm{gc}_A:A + (A \to \emptyset)}$$
This is sometimes called "excluded middle" in the [[propositions as types]] interpretation of type theory, where the principle of excluded middle is reinterpreted so that types are used instead of [[mere propositions]]. But this choice principle is a much stronger axiom than excluded middle, being of comparable strength to a [[choice operator]] and implying that every type is an [[h-set]]; hence inconsistent with the univalence axiom. 

### Canonicity and homotopy canonicity
 {#Canonicity}

It is currently open whether the univalence axiom enjoys [[canonicity]] in general, but for the special case of [[1-truncated]] homotopy types ([[groupoids]]) (and two nested univalent [[universes]] and [[function extensionality]]), [[homotopy canonicity]] has been shown in ([Shulman 12, section 13](#Shulman12).  Thus, in univalent homotopy 1-type theory with two universes, every [[term]] of [[type]] of the [[natural numbers]] is [[propositional equality|propositionally equal]] to a [[numeral]].

The construction in ([Shulman 12, section 13](#Shulman12)) uses [[Artin gluing]] of a suitable [[type-theoretic model category|type-theoretic fibration category]] with the [[category]] [[Set]] and [[Grpd]], respectively, effectively inducing canonicity from these categories. By ([Shulman 12, remark 13.13](#Shulman12)) for this construction to generalize to untruncated univalent type theory, one seems to need a sufficiently strict [[global sections]] functor with values in some model for [[infinity-groupoids]]. A proof of the full result has been announced by [[Christian Sattler]] and [[Krzysztof Kapulkin]] ([Sattler 19](#Sattler19)).

Notice that this sort of [[canonicity]] does not yet imply [[computational effectiveness]], which would require also an [[algorithm]] to extract that [[numeral]] from the given [[term]].  There may be such an algorithm, but so far attempts to extract one from the proof (or to give a [[constructive mathematics|constructive]] version of the [[proof]], which would imply the existence of an algorithm) have not succeeded.

It is also a *[[propositional equality|propositional]]* canonicity, as opposed to the [[judgmental equality|judgmental]] canonicity which many traditional [[type theories]] enjoy.  Another approach to canonicity for 1-truncated univalence can be found in ([Harper-Licata](#HarperLicata)), which involves modifying the type theory by adding more [[judgmental equalities]], resulting in a judgmental canonicity.  However, no [[algorithm]] for computing canonical forms has yet been given for this approach either.

Canonicity has been proved for [[cubical type theory]].

One might also try to construct the Hoffman-Streicher groupoid model in a constructive framework; Awodey and Bauer have done some work in this direction with an [[predicative mathematics|impredicative]] [[universe]] of [[h-sets]].

### A univalent universe inside a non-univalent universe

In a post to the [Homotopy Type Theory Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/homotopytypetheory), Peter LeFanu Lumsdaine [wrote](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/homotopytypetheory/3wp32xV7OX0/2HfAnBt44XoJ):

> Let $(x_0:X)$ be any [[pointed type]], and $(\mathcal{U}, El)$ be a universe (with rules as I set out a couple of emails ago). Then $X \times \mathcal{U}$ is again a universe, admitting all the same constructors as $\mathcal{U}$: take

> $El(x,A) = El(A)$,  
> $(x,A) +_\mathcal{U} (y,B) = (x_0, A +_\mathcal{U} B)$,

> and so on; that is, constructor operations on $(X \times \mathcal{U})$ are constantly $x_0$ on the first component, and mirror those of $\mathcal{U}$ on the second component.

> Now if $\mathcal{U}$ is univalent, and $X$ has non-trivial $\pi_0$ (e.g. $X=S^1$), then $\mathcal{U} \rightarrow (X \times \mathcal{U}$) gives a univalent universe sitting inside a non-univalent one (again, with the rules as I set out earlier).

> Slightly more generally, given any cumulative pair of universes $\mathcal{U}_0 \rightarrow \mathcal{U}_1$, we can consider $\mathcal{U}_0 \rightarrow A \times \mathcal{U}_1$; this shows we can additionally have the smaller universe represented by an element of the larger one.

[[Mike Shulman]] [added](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/homotopytypetheory/3wp32xV7OX0/kIapR0lo1UEJ):

> [N]ot only is $X \times \mathcal{U}$ not univalent, it's not even "univalent on the image of $\mathcal{U}$", as was the case for the example in the groupoid model that I mentioned.

Arguably, the earliest occurrence of a version of the univalence axiom is due -- under the name "universe extensionality" -- to:

* {#HofmannStreicher98} [[Martin Hofmann]], [[Thomas Streicher]], Section 5.4 of:  _The groupoid interpretation of type theory_, in: [[Giovanni Sambin]] et al. (eds.), *Twenty-five years of constructive type theory*, Proceedings of a congress, Venice, Italy, October 19-21, 1995. Oxford: Clarendon Press. Oxf. Logic Guides. **36** (1998) 83-111   &lbrack;[ISBN:9780198501275](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/twenty-five-years-of-constructive-type-theory-9780198501275), [ps](http://www.mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de/~streicher/venedig.ps.gz), [[HofmannStreicherGroupoidInterpretation.pdf:file]]&rbrack;

Strictly speaking, univalence for *propositions* has a much longer pedigree, this that can and does hold even in [[set-level foundations]], but this is the earliest version of univalence that goes beyond what is possible there.  However, their universe extensionality axiom is stated only for [[h-sets]], and would be incorrect if naively generalized to higher types.  The correct statement that works for higher types requires a better definition of [[equivalences in homotopy type theory]] (see [there](equivalence+in+type+theory#TheIssueWithQuasiInverses) for details), which Voevodsky was the first to give.

ever since the univalence axiom is widely attributed to Voevodsky. Earlier documentation of the univalence axiom in modern form is hard to come by:

The first technical understanding of (the semantics of) univalence in simplicial sets seems to be due to:

The first mentioning by Voevodsky of the term "univalence" by email is 3.5 years later, from [Dec. 30 2009](https://groups.google.com/g/homotopytypetheory/c/K_4bAZEDRvE/m/3N2xxxfSAAAJ) (according to [Grayson, Oct. 2017](https://groups.google.com/g/homotopytypetheory/c/K_4bAZEDRvE/m/-Lp5dxTTAAAJ)).

The earliest recorded statement of the univalence axiom by Voevodsky's hand date may be [Voevodsky (2010), p. 11](#Voevodsky10)

This does not yet show that the univalence axiom in its usual form holds in the internal type theory of [[(infinity,1)-toposes]], however, due to the lack of a (known) sufficiently strict model for the object classifier.  (But it works with [[Tarski universes]], see there and [[type universes]]). Constructions of such a model in some very special cases are in [Shulman12](#Shulman12) above, and also in
