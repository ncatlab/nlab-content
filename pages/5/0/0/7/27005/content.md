## Definition

Let $X$ be a [[set]], and consider the countably infinite [[product]] $X^\mathbb{N}$. The **shift** is the map 
\begin{tikzcd}[%
nodes={scale=1.25}, arrows={thick},%
row sep=0,%
]
X^\mathbb{N} \ar{r}{\sigma} & X^\mathbb{N} \\
(x_0,x_1,x_2,\dots) \ar[mapsto]{r} & (x_1,x_2,x_3,\dots) ,
\end{tikzcd}
which one can interpret as a "shift to the left". 

Equivalently, it is the [[product projection]]
$$
X^\mathbb{N} \cong X \times X^\mathbb{N} \to X^\mathbb{N} .
$$

## Generalizations

### In other categories

A similar definition of shift can be given in other [[categories]] with [[products]], and more generally in any [[copy-discard category]]. In the field of [[dynamical systems]], for example, the following categories are of interest:

* The category of [[compact]] [[metric spaces]];
* The [[Meas|category of measurable spaces and measurable maps]];
* The [[Prob|category of probability spaces and measure-preserving maps]];
* The [[Krn|category of probability spaces and measure preserving Markov kernels]].

(Outside the cartesian case, one needs a notion of [[infinite tensor product]].)


### For generic actions

One can generalize the definition as follows. 
Let $M$ be a [[monoid]] with an [[action]] on a finite set $S=\{1,\dots,n\}$, and denote the action by $m:S\to S$ for each $m\in M$. 

Given an object $X$ in a [[category]], consider the $S$-fold [[product]] $X^S$. We have an action of $M$ on $X^S$ given as follows. For each $m\in M$, we define the map $m^*:X^S\to X^S$ in terms of its product projections $\pi_i\circ m^*:X^S\to X$ given by
$$
\pi_i\circ m^* \;\coloneqq\; \pi_{m(i)} .
$$

Similarly, if $S$ is an infinite set, we define the action of $M$ on the infinite product $X^S$ whose finitary product projections are in the form above.

Even more generally, one can replace the product with an [[infinitary tensor product]], and define the action analogously.


#### Examples

* The [usual shift](#definition) $\sigma:X^\mathbb{N}\to X^\mathbb{N}$ is induced by the action of $\mathbb{N}$ on itself via addition.
* The [[exchangeability|action of finite permutations]] on $X^\mathbb{N}$ is induced by the action of finite permutations on $\mathbb{N}$.


## Universal property

Let $M$ be a monoid, and let $C$ be a [[category]] with [[products]]. 
The forgetful functor $[BM,C]\to C$ has a [[right adjoint]] given by the action of $M$ via shifts.
