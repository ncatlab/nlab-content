## Disambiguation

Traditionally, in [[classical mathematics]], an ordered ring is a [[totally ordered ring]]. However, in [[constructive mathematics]], due to the failure of [[excluded middle]], there are multiple notions of order which are not necessarily equivalent to the notion of total order but which in the presence of [[excluded middle]] are equivalent to the notion of [[total order]], and thus, there are multiple notions of ordered rings. There are also more general notions of ordered rings, where the order is a [[preorder]], a [[partial order]], a [[lattice]], a [[pseudo-order]], or a [[strict preorder]].
