Traditionally, in classical mathematics, an ordered ring is a [[totally ordered ring]]. However, in [[constructive mathematics]], due to the failure of [[excluded middle]], there are multiple notions of order which are not necessarily equivalent to the notion of total order but which in the presence of [[excluded middle]] are equivalent to the notion of [[total order]], and thus, there are multiple notions of ordered rings. 

These include 

* [[preordered ring]]

* [[totally preordered ring]]

* [[pseudolattice preordered ring]]

* [[strictly ordered ring]]



* [[partially ordered ring]]

* [[totally ordered ring]]

* [[pseudolattice ordered ring]]

* [[linearly ordered ring]]
