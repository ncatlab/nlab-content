The __essential image__ of a functor $F: A\to B$ between $n$-categories is the smallest [[replete subcategory]] of the target $n$-category $B$ containing the __image__ of $F$, which is in turn the smallest subcategory which contains all the $n$-cells which are the images of $n$-cells in $A$. 

Note that that 

* the *image* may contain some $n$-cells which are not the images of any $n$-cell in $A$, namely the compositions of $B$-composable chains of such image $n$-cells, whose preimage $n$-cells are not forming an $A$-composable chain;

* the *essential image* in addition contains precisely all $(k-1)$-equivalent $(n-k)$-cells to the $(n-k)$-cells of the image for all $0\leq(k-1)\lt n$.
