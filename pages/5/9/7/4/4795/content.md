The __sedenions__ may be derived from the [[octonions]] using the [[Cayleyâ€“Dickson construction]]; they form an [[nonassociative algebra|algebra]] $\mathbb{S}$.  Although every sedenion has a multiplicative [[inverse element|inverse]], $\mathbb{S}$ is *not* a [[division algebra]] (which is possible since it is not [[associative algebra|associative]]).
