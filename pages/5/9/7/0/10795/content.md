## Idea

Given a [[commutative ring]] $R$, its _spectrum_ is the [[topological space]] $Spec(R)$ whose points are the [[prime ideals]] of $R$ and whose [[topology]] is the [[Zariski topology]] on these prime ideals. This topological case is also called the __prime spectrum__ of $R$.

However, usually by $Spec(R)$ one means more: the [[locally ringed space]] which is obtained by equipping the above topological space by a unique sheaf of rings $\mathcal{O}$ such that for every principal localization of commutative rings $R\to R[f^{-1}]$ we have $\mathcal{O}(Spec R[f^{-1}]) = R[f^{-1}]$ and the restrictions $\mathcal{O}(Spec R)\to\mathcal{O}(Spec R[f^{-1}])$ and $\mathcal{O}(Spec R[g^{-1}])\to\mathcal{O}(Spec R[f^{-1}])$ where $f$ divides $g$ are the corresponding localizations of rings. If the prime spectrum is taken with a structure of a locally ringed space then one may also say the affine spectrum (this terminology never used just for the underlying topological space).

One obtains a sheaf of rings whose stalks are local rings. Every locally ringed space isomorphic to an affine spectrum is said to be an [[affine scheme]].
