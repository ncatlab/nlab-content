## Idea

A *prelattice-ordered commutative monoid* is a [[commutative monoid]] which is also a [[preordered set]] with [[meet|binary meets]] and [[join|binary joins]] such that the meets and joins [[homomorphism|preserve]] the monoid's [[binary operation]], up to [[associate elements]].

## Definition

\begin{definition}
Let $(X, \cdot, 1)$ be a [[commutative monoid]] which is also a [[preordered set]] $(X, \le)$ and possesses binary [[meets]] and binary [[joins]]. We say that $X$ is a *prelattice-ordered commutative monoid* if:

1. For every $x,y,z \in X$, $(x z \wedge y z) \sim (x \wedge y)z$

1. For every $x,y,z \in X$, $(x z \vee y z) \sim (x \vee y)z$

where $\sim$ is the [[preorder|equivalence relation generated by the preorder]] $\le$.
\end{definition}

## Example

Let $R$ be a [[GCD domain]]. The [[underlying]] multiplicative [[monoid]] of $R$, together with the [[divisibility relation]] is a prelattice-ordered commutative monoid. This is the case because:

1. For every $x,y,z \in R$, $gcd(x z,y z) \sim gcd(x,y)z$

1. For every $x,y,z \in R$, $lcm(x z,y z) \sim lcm(x,y)z$

where $x \sim y$ means that $x$ and $y$ are equal up to multiplication by a unit.
