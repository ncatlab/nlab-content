## Idea

In [[quantum field theory]] what has come to be known as the _holographic principle_ is the fact that the [[partition function]]s of some [[quantum field theories]] of [[dimension]] $n$ may be identified with [[state]] of QFTs in dimension $n + 1$:


## Examples

### Poisson $\sigma$-model / quantum mechanics

Ordinary [[quantum mechanics]] induced by [[quantization]] of a [[Poisson manifold]] -- which may be regarded as a 1-dimensional QFT -- is holographically dual to the 2-dimensional [[Poisson sigma-model]] 
(implicitly observed by ([Kontsevich](#Kontsevich)) made explicit by ([CattaneoFelder](#CattaneoFelder)).

### A-model / quantum mechanics

Similarly the [[A-model]] on certain [[D-brane]]s gives a holographic description of ordinary [[quantum mechanics]]. ([Witten](#WittenAModel)).

See

* [[quantization via the A-model]]

### Chern-Simons theory / WZW-model

3-dimensional Chern-Simons theory for a group $G$ is holographically dual to the 2-dimensional [[WZW-model]].

### Higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory / Self-dual higher gauge theory

Generally, [[higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory]]
in dimension $4k+3$ (for $k \in \mathbb{N}$) is holographically related to [[self-dual higher gauge theory]] in dimension $4k+2$ (at least in the abelian case). 

* $(k=0)$: ordinary 3-dimensional [[Chern-Simons theory]] is related to a [[string]] [[sigma-model]] on its boundary;

* $(k=1)$: 7-dimensional Chern-Simons theory is related to a [[fivebrane]] model on its boundary;

* $(k=2)$: 11-dimensional Chern-Simons theory is related to a parts of a [[type II string theory]] on its bounday (or that of the space-filling 9-[[brane]], if one wishes) ([BelovMoore](#BelovMoore)).


### Ads/CFT

Conjecturally, [[type II string theory]] on a [[anti-de Sitter space]] background is holographically dual to [[super Yang-Mills theory]] on the asymptotic boundary.

See [[AdS/CFT correspondence]].
