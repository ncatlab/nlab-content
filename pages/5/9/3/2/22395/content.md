## Idea

In [[mathematics]], one often has an [[equivalence of categories]]
between [[algebra]]-like objects and [[space]]-like objects.
Such an idea has many incarnations: [[Stone duality]], [[Gelfand duality]], etc.,
and in this article we make some observations that are common to these dualities.

Given an [[algebra]]-like object $A$, we assign to it its [[poset]] of [[ideals]]
(typically defined as [[kernels]] of [[homomorphisms]] $A\to B$),
which is interpreted as the [[poset]] of opens of some [[space]] $S$.

The technical term for such [[posets]] is [[locale]],
which is a notion very closely related to [[topological spaces]].
In particular, from any [[locale]] one can canonically [extract a topological space](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/locale#RelationToTopologicalSpaces),
and this is the [[topological space]] $S$ produced in many classical Stone-type dualities.
The points of $S$ are [[ideals]] corresponding to morphisms $A\to k$, where $k$ is often a particularly simple algebra.
These often turn out to be [[maximal ideals]] in $A$.

Conversely, given a [[space]]-like object $S$, we assign to it the [[algebra]] of morphisms $S\to k$,
where $k$ is often the “same” [[algebra]] $k$ as above,
only this time its underlying object is a [[space]], not just a [[set]].

Some examples from [[general topology]], [[measure theory]], [[differential geometry]], [[algebraic geometry]], and [[complex geometry]]

and:

The duality relevant to the [[spectral theory]] is the duality between [[commutative von Neumann algebras]]
and [compact strictly localizable enhanced measurable spaces](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/20740/is-there-an-introduction-to-probability-theory-from-a-structuralist-categorical/20820#20820).

Given a [[normal operator]] $T$ on a [[Hilbert space]] $H$,
$T$ generates a [[commutative von Neumann algebra]] $A$ inside $B(H)$, i.e., [[bounded operators]] on $H$.
(This is precisely the point where normality is crucial; without the relation $T^*T=TT^*$
the algebra generated by $T$ will be noncommutative.)

By the cited duality, the [[commutative von Neumann algebra]] $A$
is dual to a compact strictly localizable enhanced measurable space $Spec A$.
This is indeed the spectrum of $T$ in the usual sense.
Under this equivalence, the element $T\in A$
corresponds to the measurable map $Spec A\to \mathbf{C}$ given by inclusion of $Spec A$ into $\mathbf{C}$.

One may ask whether we can recover the full [[spectral theorem]] for a [[normal operator]] in this manner.
This is possible once [[Stone duality]] is upgraded to Serre–Swan-type duality
between [[modules]] and [[vector bundle]]-like objects (including, e.g., [[sheaves of modules]] etc.).

Given a [[vector bundle]]-like object $V\to S$, we assign to it its [[module]] of [[sections]],
which is a [[module]] over the [[algebra]] of maps $S\to k$.
Conversely, given a [[module]] $M$ over $A$,
the corresponding [[vector bundle]]-like object $V\to S$ over $S=Spec A$
has as its [[fiber]] over some point $s\in S$ the [[vector space]] $M/IM$,
where $I$ is the [[ideal]] corresponding to $s$.
(Many details are necessarily omitted in this brief sketch.)

Typically, genuine [[vector bundles]] correspond to [[dualizable modules]]
(dualizable with respect to the [[tensor product]] over $A$).
Non-dualizable module tend to correspond to [[sheaves of modules]] that are not [[vector bundles]],
e.g., [[skyscraper sheaves]] etc.

|[[module]]|[[vector bundle]]-like object|
|-|-|
|module over a Boolean algebra|sheaf of $\mathbf{Z}/2$-vector spaces|
|[[Hilbert W*-module]] over a commutative von Neumann algebra|measurable field of Hilbert spaces|
|[[W*-representations]] of a [[commutative von Neumann algebra]] on a [[Hilbert space]]|[[measurable field of Hilbert spaces]]|
|[[Hilbert C*-module]] over a commutative unital C\*-algebra|continuous field of Hilbert spaces|
|[[module]] over a commutative ring|[[quasicoherent sheaf]] of $\mathcal{O}$-modules over an affine scheme|
|[[dualizable module]] over a commutative algebra over $k$|algebraic vector bundle|
|dualizable module over a finitely generated germ-determined C$^\infty$-ring|smooth vector bundle|
|dualizable module over finitely presented complex EFC-algebra|holomorphic vector bundle|

The duality relevant to the [[spectral theory]] is the duality between representations of a commutative von Neumann algebras on a [[Hilbert space]]
and [[measurable fields]] of Hilbert spaces.

Given a [[normal operator]] $T$ on a [[Hilbert space]] $H$,
$T$ generates a [[commutative von Neumann algebra]] $A$ inside $B(H)$,
whose [[spectrum]] $Spec A$ is a compact strictly localizable enhanced measurable space.

Furthermore, the inclusion of $A$ into $B(H)$ is a representation of $A$ on $H$.
As such, it corresponds under the Serre–Swan-type duality to a [[measurable field]] of Hilbert spaces over $A$.
This is precisely the [[measurable field]] produced by the classical [[spectral theorem]].

Under the duality, the operator $T$ corresponds to the operator that
multiplies a given [[section]] of this [[measurable field]] of Hilbert spaces
by the complex-valued function $Spec A\to \mathbf{C}$ produced above. 
Thus, we recovered the entire content of the classical [[spectral theorem]].

In fact, the above considerations work equally well to establish the [[spectral theorem]]
for an arbitrary family (not necessarily finite) of commuting normal operators.
