Michael Makkai is the inventor of [[anafunctor]]s and [[FOLDS]], which are both ways of doing [[category theory]] and [[higher category theory]] without saying anything [[evil]] or requiring the [[axiom of choice]].  Makkai is also important in the category-theoretic approach to [[logic]] (which is mostly the approach that you see here on the $n$-Lab).
