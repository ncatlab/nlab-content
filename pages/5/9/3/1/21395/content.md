## Definition

A [[category]] $C$ is **bicomplete** if it is both a [[complete category]] as well as a [[cocomplete category]], hence if it has all [[small limit|small]] [[limit|limits]] and [[colimits]]: that is, if every [[small diagram|small]] [[diagram]]

$$ F: D \to C$$

where $D$ is a [[small category]] has a [[limit]] and a [[colimit]] in $C$.
