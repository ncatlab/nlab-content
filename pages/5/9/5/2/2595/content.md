#Definition#


A [[topos]] can be considered a symmetric monoidal category with respect to the cartesian product. Thus the notion of a unital [[ring]], and commutative unital ring can be defined in that monoidal category.  

A **ringed topos** is a [[topos]] $X$ with a distinguished unital ring $\mathcal{O}$ in $X$, usually, but not necessarily commutative. 

The standard references are SGA IV and

J. Lurie is also making a modern exposition of this notion along with $(\infty,1)$-version; see also HAG and DAG by Toen et al.  

#Examples#

* A [[ringed space]] $(X,\mathcal{O})$ induces the ringed [[localic topos]] $(Sh(X),\mathcal{O})$ of [[sheaf|sheaves]] on the [[category of open subsets]] of that space. Similarly but more generally a  [[ringed site]] $(S, \mathcal{O})$ induces the ringed [[Grothendieck topos]] $(Sh(S), \mathcal{O})$.

* In some appllcations the ringed topos is refined to a [[lined topos]] when instead of a [[ring]] object an [[algebra]]-object is required.
