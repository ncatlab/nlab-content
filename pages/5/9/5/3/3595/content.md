Hi,
after spending some time at the universities of G&#246;ttingen and Heidelberg, I graduated in physics and started to work as a software developer, currently living in Munich, Germany.

But I still like to think about mathematical physics and pure mathematics, which is why I visit the caf&#233; in my spare time -- and since one learns best by trying to explain things, I like to add a little bit to the nLab iff I have anything to say (doesn't happen too often).

My primary interest lies in mathematical aspects of quantum field theories.

My Email address is: &lt;Tim.van.Beek@capgemini-sdm.com>

But primarily this [outdoor fountains](http://www.outdoorfountains.com/) page exists to get rid of this odd question mark behind my name that appears after I have changed a page!
