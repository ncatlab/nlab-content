## Idea

A Jordan--Lie algebra is a [[quantum deformation]] of a [[Poisson algebra]], consisting of a single [[vector space]] with compatible structures of both a [[Jordan algebra]] and a [[Lie algebra]].  Secretly, they are the same thing as [[complexification|complexified]] $*$-[[star-algebras]].  If we add an appropriate [[topological structure]], then we get a Jordan--Lie--[[Banach algebra]] (corresponding to complex Banach $*$-algebras), of which the $JLB$-algebras (corresponding to $C^*$-[[C-star algebra|algebras]]) and $JLBW$-algebras (corresponding to [[von Neumann algebras]]) are important special cases.

In traditional [[strict deformation quantization]] the outcome of [[quantization]] of [[Poisson algebras]] is regarded to be a non-commutative but associative complex $*$-[[star-algebra|algebra]] (such as a $C^*$-[[C-star-algebra|algebra]]).  But any such induces a Jordan--Lie algebra (consisting of its [[self-adjoint elements]]) by letting the Jordan product be the symmetrized product and the [[Lie bracket]] the [[commutator]] (times $\mathrm{i}/2$). There is a condition relating the [[associator]] of the Jordan product to the Lie bracket, which makes $JLB$-algebras effectively the same as $C^*$-algebras, the only difference being that the single associative product is explicitly regarded as inducing the two products of a $JLB$-algebra. For more on this separation of the Lie-algebra and the Jordan-algebra aspect of quantization see at _[[order-theoretic structure in quantum mechanics]]_.


## Definitions and elementary properties

Let $K$ be a [[formally real field]] (in particular, $1/2 \in K$), and let $q \in K$ be a scalar.  (Most of what we say here works over more general fields or even [[commutative rings]], but there are arguments that the usual notion of [[Jordan algebra]] is inappropriate already for fields of characteristic $2$, so I don\'t want to pretend to more generality than we can justify.  Indeed, there does not yet seem to be any published literature on Jordan--Lie algebras that doesn\'t set $K$ to the field $\mathbb{R}$ of [[real numbers]].)

A __Jordan--Lie algebra__ (over $K$ with deformation constant $q$) consists of a $K$-[[vector space]] $A$ equipped with two [[bilinear operators]] $(-)\circ(-)$ and $[{-},{-}]$, respectively called the _[[Jordan product]]_ and the _[[Lie bracket]]_, satisfying the following identities:

* commutativity of the Jordan product: $x \circ y = y \circ x$;
* alternation (anticommutativity) of the Lie bracket: $[x, x] = 0$, or equivalently (using bilinearity and that $1/2 \in K$) $[x, y] = -[y, x]$;
* the Jacobi identity (self-derivation of the Lie bracket): $[x, [y, z]] = [[x, y], z] + [y, [x, z]]$, or equivalently (using anticommutativity) $[x, [y, z]] + [y, [z, x]] + [z, [x, y]] = 0$;
* derivation of the Lie bracket over the Jordan product: $[x, y \circ z] = [x, y] \circ z + y \circ [x, z]$;
* the associator identity: $x \circ (y \circ z) = (x \circ y) \circ z + h^2 [y, [x, z]]$, or equivalently (using anticommutativity) $(x \circ y) \circ z - x \circ (y \circ z) = h^2 [[x, z], y]$.

Note that the last two axioms (and alternation) prove the Jordan identity: first,
$$ [x, x \circ x] = [x, x] \circ x + x \circ [x, x] = 0 ;$$
then (writing $x^2$ for $x \circ x$),
$$ x \circ (y \circ x^2) - (x \circ y) \circ x^2 = h^2 [y, [x, x^2]] = 0 .$$
Thus, $A$ is a [[Jordan algebra]] under the Jordan product, and of course $A$ is a [[Lie algebra]] under the Lie bracket.  (In a similar way, we can prove the Jacobi identity from the associator identity if $q$ is cancellable; but we state the Jacobi identity separately to cover when $q = 0$ as well.)

As usual for Jordan algebras, we write $x^n$ for an $n$-fold product of $x$ under the Jordan product; this is unambiguous since Jordan algebras are always power-associative.  (And of course, an $n$-fold Lie bracket is always zero for $n \gt 1$.)  Even more generally the un[[bias]]ed form of the Jordan identity is that multiplication by $x^m$ and by $x^n$ commute:
$$ (x^m \circ y) \circ x^n = x^m \circ (y \circ x^n) $$
(which may be proved by [[induction]] using only the usual Jordan identity).  We similarly have that powers of $x$ commute with each other under the bracket:
$$ [x^m, x^n] = 0 .$$
The proof is similar to the proof above that $[x, x^2] = 0$, by induction.  (Then you can use this to get a faster proof of the unbiased Jordan identity.)

A Jordan--Lie algebra is __unital__ if the Jordan product has   an [[identity element]] $1$:

* multiplicative identity: $1 \circ x = x$.

Then we may also interpret $x^0$ as $1$.  Note that $[x, 1] = 0$ too (a special case of $[x^m, x^n] = 0$), proved by examining $[x, 1 \circ 1]$.

If $K$ is a [[normed field]], then a __Jordan--Lie--Banach algebra__ consists of a $K$-[[Banach space]] $A$ equipped with a [[short linear operator|short]] [[bilinear operator]] (as the Jordan product) and a [[densely defined linear operator|densely defined]] bilinear operator (as the Lie bracket) making the domain of the Lie bracket into a Jordan--Lie algebra as above.  Then (using continuity) $A$ is also a [[Jordanâ€“Banach algebra]] under the Jordan product.  A Jordan--Lie--Banach algebra is __unital__ if the Jordan algebra has a unit and $\|1\| \leq 1$ (in which case $\|1\| = 1$ if $A$ is nontrivial).

A __$JLB$-algebra__ is a Jordan--Lie--Banach algebra satisfying the following additional identities:

* the $B$-identity: ${\|x\|^2} = {\|x^2\|}$ (compare the $B^*$-identity or $C^*$-identity of a $C^*$-[[C-star-algebra|algebra]]);
* positivity: ${\|x^2\|} \leq {\|x^2 + y^2\|}$.

Then $A$ is a [[JB-algebra]] under the Jordan product.

As with any $JB$-algebra, we don\'t need to explicitly state that the Jordan product is short (nor its identity in the unital case), as this can be proved using the $B$-identity and the [[polarization identities]].  (Conversely, if we do state that the product is short, then we only need the $\leq$ half of the $B$-identity in addition, or we can even combine it with positivity as ${\|x\|^2} \leq {\|x^2 + y^2\|}$.)  We can also prove (by induction on $\lceil\log_2 n\rceil$) that $|x^n| = |x|^n$ (except for $n = 0$ in the trivial algebra).

Positivity generalizes to any number of terms on either side (as long as the right-hand side has more, of course).  (However, I don\'t see how to prove this without going through the [[functional calculus]] to prove that every sum of squares has a [[square root]].)  Thus, a $JB$-algebra is [[formally real algebra|formally real]]: if $\sum_i x_i^2 = 0$, then each $x_i = 0$ (because the norms lie in a formally real field).

Following the established terminology for $JB$-algebras, a _$JLC$-algebra_ may be defined as a *concrete* $JLB$-algebra, that is one equipped with a faithful representation (see [below](#representations)) on a [[Hilbert space]], or equivalently a real [[subalgebra]] of $SA(H)$ (see [below](#examples)) that is closed in the [[operator topology]].  However, like $C^*$-algebras (but unlike general $JB$-algebras), every $JLB$-algebra may be so represented and this term seems not to be used.

Finally, a __$JLBW$-algebra__ is a $JLB$-algebra with an [[identity element]] whose underlying Banach space is equipped with a (necessarily unique) [[predual]], and _$JLW$-algebra_ is further equipped with a faithful representation (or equivalently is a $JC$-algebra which includes the identity and is closed in the [[weak operator topology]]).  Again, every abstract algebra may be made concrete, although neither term seems to be established in the literature yet.


## Relation to Poisson algebras {#poisson}

If $q = 0$, then the Jordan product becomes associative; in fact, a Jordan--Lie algebra with $q = 0$ is precisely a commutative [[Poisson algebra]].  On the other hand, if $q \ne 0$, then dividing the Lie bracket by $q$ gives a Jordan--Lie algebra with $q = 1$, so the only thing that really matters about $q$ is whether or not it is zero.  In this way, a Jordan--Lie algebra may be seen as a [[quantum deformation]] of a Poisson algebra.  (In the [[physics|physical]] interpretation, $q$ here is the [[Dirac constant]] $\hbar$.)

Similarly, a Jordan--Banach algebra with $q = 0$ is a commutative Banach algebra equipped with a Poisson bracket (typically unbounded), and similarly for the more specialized versions; then the $q \gt 0$ case is a quantum deformation of such Poisson--Banach algebras.


## Relation to $C^*$-algebras {#cstar}

For a $JLB$-algebra with $q = 1$, the Jordan product and Lie bracket are respectively the real-symmetrized and imaginary-antisymmetrized parts of an associative operation on the [[complexification]] of $A$, defining a complex $C^*$-[[C-star-algebra|algebra]]; and every $C^*$-algebra likewise defines a $JLB$-algebra with $q = 1$ consisting of its [[Hermitian operator|Hermitian]] elements.

Specifically, starting with a $JLB$-algebra $A$, we write $A \oplus A$ formally as $A + \mathrm{i} A$, on which we define the following operations:

* norm: ${\|a + \mathrm{i} b\|} \coloneqq \sqrt{{\|a\|^2} + {\|b\|^2}}$,
* addition: $(a + \mathrm{i} b) + (c + \mathrm{i} d) \coloneqq (a + c) + \mathrm{i} (b + d)$,
* opposite: $-(a + \mathrm{i} b) \coloneqq (-a) + \mathrm{i} (-b)$,
* zero: $0 \coloneqq 0 + \mathrm{i} 0$,
* scalar multiplication: $(x + \mathrm{i} y) (a + \mathrm{i} b) = (x a - y b) + \mathrm{i} (x b + y a)$ (for $x + \mathrm{i} y$ a [[complex number]]),
* involution: $(a + \mathrm{i} b)^* \coloneqq a + \mathrm{i} (-b)$,
* multiplication: $(a + \mathrm{i} b) (c + \mathrm{i} d) \coloneqq (a \circ c + [a, d] + [b, c] - b \circ d) + \mathrm{i} (-[a, c] + a \circ d + b \circ c + [b, d])$.

If the Jordan product of the $JLB$-algebra has an identity $1$, then so does the $C^*$-algebra:

* $1 \coloneqq 1 + \mathrm{i} 0$.

Conversely, starting with a $C^*$-algebra $A$, we form the subspace $sa(A) = \{x\colon A \;|\; x^* = x\}$, on which we define the following operations (under each of which $sa(A)$ is closed):

* norm, addition, opposite, zero, scalar multiplication (by [[real numbers]] only): by [[restriction]],
* Jordan product: $a \circ b \coloneqq \frac{1}{2} a b + \frac{1}{2} b a$,
* Lie bracket: $[a, b] \coloneqq \frac{1}{2} \mathrm{i} a b - \frac{1}{2} \mathrm{i} b a$.

If the $C^*$-algebra has an identity, then this is also an identity for the Jordan product (so $1$ is also defined by restriction).

This all defines a [[functor]] each way between the [[groupoids]] of $C^*$-algebras and $JLB$-algebras with $q = 1$, which in fact (I hope!) form an [[equivalence of categories|adjoint equivalence]].  Since we have a notion of [[morphism]] (not just [[isomorphism]]) of $C^*$-algebras, we can transport this along the equivalence to get a notion of morphism of $JLB$-algebras (which I would expect to be a short linear map that preserves both products) and thus a [[category]] $JLB Alg$ equivalent to $C^* Alg$.

Then real $JLBW$-algebras are equivalent to complex $W^*$-[[W-star-algebra|algebras]].

If you start with a $JLB$-algebra with $q \ne 1$ (including $q = 0$, that is a Poisson $B$-algebra), then you can still get a complex $C^*$-algebra by modifying the definition of multiplication:
$$ (a + \mathrm{i} b) (c + \mathrm{i} d) \coloneqq (a \circ c + q [a, d] + q [b, c] - b \circ d) + \mathrm{i} (-q [a, c] + a \circ d + b \circ c + q [b, d]) .$$
Then if $q \ne 0$, you can recover the original $JLB$-algebra with a modified definition of the Lie bracket:
$$ [a, b] \coloneqq \frac{1}{2q} \mathrm{i} a b - \frac{1}{2q} \mathrm{i} b a .$$

In particular, for a fixed $q \ne 0$, the category of $JLB$-algebras with one value of $q$ is equivalent to the category of $JLB$-algebras with another value of $q$ (since both are equivalent to complex $C^*$-algebras), but we have only a functor from $JLB$-algebras with $q = 0$ to any other category.  (And this is not a very interesting functor, since it simply throws away the original Lie bracket and replaces it with zero.)


## Examples {#examples}

Any commutative [[associative algebra]] is a trivial example of a Jordan--Lie algebra with the Lie bracket set to [[zero]].  Similarly, any commutative [[Banach algebra]] is a Jordan--Lie--Banach algebra, any commutative $C^*$-[[C-star-algebra|algebra]] with trivial involution is a $JLB$-algebra, and any commutative $W^*$-[[W-star-algebra|algebra]] with trivial involution is a $JLBW$-algebra.  Note that the value of $q$ is irrelevant in these examples.

More interestingly, given any $C^*$-[[C-star-algebra|algebra]] (*not* assumed commutative or with trivial involution), the [[self-adjoint elements]] form a $JLB$-algebra with $q = 1$; if the original $C^*$-algebra is a $W^*$-[[W-star-algebra|algebra]], then the self-adjoint elements form a $JLBW$-algebra.  In fact, *every* $JLB$-algebra (including every $JLBW$-algebra) with $q = 1$ has this form (see [above](#cstar)).

More generally, given a $C^*$-[[C-star-algebra|algebra]] and $q \gt 0$, the self-adjoint elements form a $JLB$-algebra with this value of $q$ if we divide the Lie bracket by $q$.  In fact, every $JLB$-algebra with $q \gt 0$ has this form.

More specifically, given a [[Hilbert space]] $H$, the [[self-adjoint operators]] form a $JLBW$-algebra $SA(H)$ with $q = 1$.  In fact, *every* $JLB$-algebra (including every $JLBW$-algebra) with $q = 1$ is a subalgebra of some $SA(H)$; more generally, every $JLB$-algebra with $q \ne 0$ has this form upon dividing the Lie bracket by $q$.

As for $q = 0$, every commutative [[Poisson algebra]] is a Jordan--Lie algebra with $q = 0$, and every Jordan--Lie algebra with $q = 0$ has this form.  This settles the purely algebraic case.

For the topological case with $q = 0$, fix a [[symplectic manifold]] (or [[Poisson manifold]]) $X$ and take the unital Banach algebra of [[bounded continuous functions]] on $X$, equipped with the [[Poisson bracket]].  Here, the Poisson bracket is unbounded and not defined everywhere.  (You could also use the Banach space of [[smooth functions]] whose derivatives of all orders are bounded, but the Poisson bracket is still unbounded and not defined everywhere, since there are bounded smooth functions with unbounded derivatives, unless $X$ is [[closed manifold|closed]].)  This is a $JLB$-algebra with $q = 0$.

Let $V$ be a (real) [[vector space]] of finite dimension $n$, which we will think of as the [[configuration space]] of a [[classical system]], and let $A$ be the [[symmetric algebra]] on the dual [[phase space]] $V \otimes V^* \cong \mathbb{R}^{2n}$.  We normally think of $A$ as consisting of (commutative) [[polynomials]] in the variables $x^1, \ldots, x^n, p_1, \ldots, p_n$, but let us now think of them as *noncommutative* polynomials consisting only of terms in which the variables come in order.  Fixing a scalar $q$, define the Jordan product on $A$ so that $x^i \circ x^j = x^{\min(i,j)} x^{\max(i,j)}$, $p_i \circ p_j = p_{\min(i,j)} p_{\max(i,j)}$, and $x^i \circ p_j = x^i p_j + q \delta^i_j$; in other words, to remove $\circ$ from a product, we must add a term with a factor of $q$ whenever $x^i$ and $p_i$ appear on opposite sides of $\circ$.  Also, define the Lie bracket so that $[x^i, x^j] = 0$, $[p_i, p_j] = 0$, and $[q^i, p_j] = -h \delta^i_j$.  Then when $q = 0$, $A$ is the usual symmetric algebra of commutative polynomials again, while for $q = 1$, $A$ becomes $sa(W)$, where $W$ is the [[Weyl algebra]] $A + \mathrm{i} A$.


## Representations

In general, a [[representation]] of Jordan--Lie algebra $A$ in a Jordan--Lie algebra $B$ is simply a [[homomorphism]] (in the usual sense of [[universal algebra]]) from $A$ to $B$.  But when $q \gt 0$, we often take $B$ to be an associative $*$-[[*-algebra]] and represent $A$ in it with a homomorphism to $sa(B)$, the Jordan--Lie algebra of self-adjoint elements of $B$ (see [above](#examples)).  When $A$ is a Jordan--Lie--Banach algebra, then we generally want $B$ to be the same, or to be a [[Banach *-algebra|Banach algebra]], and for the homomorphism to be [[short map|short]].  Similarly, when $A$ is unital, we generally want $B$ to be the same, and to have the homomorphism preserve the unit.  When $A$ is a $JLB$-algebra, then we generally want $B$ to be the same, or to be a $C^*$-[[C-star-algebra|algebra]]; and when $A$ is a $JLBW$-algebra, then we generally want $B$ to be the same or to be a $W^*$-[[W-star-algebra|algebra]].  (In these cases, the homomorphism is automatically short and automatically preserves any unit.)

Instead of a representation *in* $B$, we can also consider a representation *on* $H$, where $H$ is an [[inner product space]] over the [[complex numbers]] (or the complexification of $K$ more generally).  This is a representation in the $*$-algebra of [[linear operators]] on $H$, or equivalently a representation in the Jordan--Lie algebra of self-adjoint operators on $H$.  When $B$ is a Jordan--Lie--Banach algebra (especially a $JLB$-algebra or even a $JLBW$-algebra), then we may take $H$ to be a [[Hilbert space]] and look only at the [[bounded operators]].
