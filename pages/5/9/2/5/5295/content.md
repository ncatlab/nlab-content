## Idea

Intuitionistic mathematics is a variety of [[constructive mathematics]] done according to the principles accepted by [[Jan Brouwer]] and his philosophy of intuitionism.


## Terminology

There are a variety of ways to use the term 'intuitionistic'.  We list them here from the most specific to the most general:

*  __Intuitionism__ is an early-20th-century [[philosophy of mathematics]] developed by Brouwer, according to which [[mathematics]] is a free creation of a mind, and valid results are about what that mind creates (rather than about an external reality, as in [[platonism]], or about nothing, as in [[formalism]]).  From this starting point, Brouwer developed a very controversial style of mathematics and even [[logic]], which he saw as derived from mathematics (rather than conversely, as in [[logicism]]).

*  __Intuitionistic mathematics__ is the mathematics that Brouwer came up with.  However, it\'s not necessary to accept Brouwer\'s philosophy to practise intuitionistic mathematics; conversely, one may accept Brouwer\'s philosophical starting place but not his conclusions about the resulting mathematics.

*  __[[Intuitionistic logic]]__ is the logic that Brouwer\'s mathematics uses, which lacks the principle of [[excluded middle]].  However, there are many other styles of mathematics that also use intuitionistic logic; these are known more generally as [[constructive mathematics]].


## Mathematical principles

Brouwer never accepted a complete axiomatisation of intuitionistic mathematics.  However, we can identify several principles, which may not (even historically) be complete.

*  In hindsight, we may say that inuitionistic mathematics is done in a [[pretopos]] identified as [[Set]].

*  We have the [[axiom of infinity]] and [[countable choice]], as in [[classical mathematics]].

*  We have the classically false principles of [[continuity principle|continuity]] and [[continuous choice]].

*  We have the [[fan theorem]] and [[bar theorem]], which are classically true but fail in [[Russian constructivism]].

*  There\'s also some stuff about [[choice sequence]]s that I don\'t really understand.

Although it\'s not enough to derive all of the above, much of the essence of intuitionistic mathematics can be summarised in the theorem that every (set-theoretic) [[function]] from the [[unit interval]] to the [[real line]] is [[uniformly continuous map|uniformly continuous]].
