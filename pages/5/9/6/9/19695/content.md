## Idea

### General

Generally, given some kind of [[space]] equipped with the [[action]] of a [[group]], the locus of _[[fixed points]]_ of the action may form a suitable sub-space: the _fixed point space_.

### For topological $G$-spaces

Specifically, given a [[topological group]] $G$ and a [[topological G-space]], its _fixed point space_ is the set of the set-theoretic [[fixed points]] of the $G$-[[action]], equipped with the [[subspace topology]].

### In equivariant homotopy theory

The statement of [[Elmendorf's theorem]] is essentially that the [[equivariant homotopy theory]] of [[G-space|topological $G$-spaces]] is equivalently encoded in their systems of $H$-fixed point spaces, as $H$ varies over [[closed subspace|closed]] [[subgroups]] of $G$.

### In equivariant stable homotopy theory

In [[equivariant stable homotopy theory]] the concept of fixed point spaces branches into various closely related, but different concepts:

* [[fixed point spectra]],

* [[geometric fixed point spectra]]

* [[categorical fixed point spectra]]

## Related concepts
