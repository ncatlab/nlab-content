## Idea

The phenomenon or principle called _vector meson dominance_ (VMD) is a tight relation between [[quantum hadrodynamics]] and [[quantum electrodynamics]], where the neutral [[vector meson]] [[field (physics)|fields]] $V_\mu$ (the [[omega-meson]] $\omega_\mu$ and the neutral [[rho-meson]] $\rho^0_\mu$) are seen to be on par with, or even identified with, the [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] [[current]] $J_\mu = \overline{\psi}\gamma^\mu \psi$. 

In [[particle physics]] [[phenomenology]] this is the observation that the [[interaction]] of [[hadrons]] with [[photons]] is dominated by [[interactions]] via [[vector mesons]] (...).

In [[theory (physics)|theory]], vector meson dominance is encoded by the _field-current identity_  ([Gell-Mann & Zachariasen 61](#GellMannZachariasen61), [Kroll, Lee & Zumino 76, (1.3)](#KrollLeeZumino76), [Sakurai 69, p. 54 onwards](#Sakurai69)):

$$
  V_\mu \;\sim\; J_\mu
  \,,
$$ 

which means in particular that all [[coupling constants]] of [[interactions]] with an [[omega-mesons]]/neutral [[rho-meson]] are proportional, by the same factor, to the corresponding electromagnetic coupling (reviewed in [Schildknecht 05, p. 3](#Schildknecht05)). 

In terms of a [[Lagrangian density]], this is encoded by meson/photon _mixed terms_ of the form ([Kroll, Lee & Zumino 76, (2.7)](#KrollLeeZumino76),[Sakurai 69, p. 67](#Sakurai69))

$$  
  \mathbf{L}_{VMD}
  \;\sim\;
  d V \wedge \star_4 d A
  \;+\;
  V \wedge \star_4 J_{hadr}
$$ 

obtained from the Lagrangian density $\mathbf{L}_{EM} \;\sim\; d A \wedge \star_{4} d A + A \wedge \star_4 J_{hadr}$ of [[Maxwell theory]] by exchanging a [[photon]] field variable $A$ with a [[vector meson]] [[field (physics)|field]] $V$ (reviewed in [OCPTW 95, p. 10](#OCPTW95), [Schildknecht 05, p. 4](#Schildknecht05)).


## Properties

### Derivation from holography

From [OCPTW 95](#OCPTW95):

> No direct translation between the [[standard model of particle physics|Standard Model]] and [[vector meson dominance|VMD]] has yet been made.

\linebreak

From [Rho et al. 16](AdS-QCD#RhoEtAl16):

> One can make $[$[[chiral perturbation theory]]$]$ consistent with [[QCD]] by suitably matching the [[correlators]] of the [[effective field theory|effective theory]] to those of [[QCD]] at a [[scale]] near $\Lambda$. Clearly this procedure is not limited to only one set of [[vector mesons]]; in fact, one can readily generalize it to an infinite number of hidden [[gauge fields]] in an [[effective field theory|effective]] [[Lagrangian density|Lagrangian]]. In so doing, it turns out that a fifth dimension is "deconstructed" in a (4+1)-dimensional (or 5D) [[Yang-Mills theory|Yang–Mills]] type form. We will see in Part III that such a structure arises, [[top-down model building|top-down]], in [[string theory]].

> $[...]$

> $[$this [[holographic QCD]]$]$ model comes out to describe — unexpectedly well — low-energy properties of both [[mesons]] and [[baryons]], in particular those properties reliably described in quenched [[lattice QCD]] simulations.

> $[...]$

> One of the most noticeable results of this [[AdS/QCD|holographic model]] is the first derivation of vector dominance (VD) that holds both for [[mesons]] and for [[baryons]]. It has been
somewhat of an oddity and a puzzle that [[Jun John Sakurai|Sakurai's]] [[vector meson dominance|vector dominance]] — with the lowest [[vector mesons]] [[rho meson|ρ]] and [[omega meson|ω]] — which held very well for [[pion|pionic]] [[form factors]] at low momentum transfers famously failed for [[nucleon]] [[form factors]]. In this [[AdS/QCD|holographic model]], the [[vector meson dominance|VD]] comes out automatically for both the [[pion]] and the [[nucleon]] provided that the infinite $[$[[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|KK-]]$]$tower is included. While the [[vector meson dominance|VD]] for the [[pion]] with the infinite tower is not surprising given the successful Sakurai VD, that the [[vector meson dominance|VD]] holds also for the [[nucleons]] is highly nontrivial. $[...]$ It turns out to be a consequence of a [[AdS/QCD|holographic]] [[Cheshire cat principle|Cheshire Cat phenomenon]]
