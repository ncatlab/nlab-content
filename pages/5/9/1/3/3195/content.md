A subset $A$ of a [[topological space]] $X$ is **relatively compact** if its closure $\bar{A}$ is [[compact space|compact]]. We also say that $A$ with its [[induced topology]] is a __relatively compact [[subspace]]__ of $X$.

The relatively compact subsets of a [[Hausdorff space]] $X$ form an [[ideal]] in the [[power set]] of $X$.
