A **set** is a [[category]] with only [[identity morphism|identity morphisms]].  Equivalently, it is a [[category]] that is simultaneously a [[groupoid]] and a [[partial order|poset]].

(This may be equivalent to whatever definition you are used to, or you may have to restrict attention to [[small category|small categories]], depending on your [[foundations]].)
