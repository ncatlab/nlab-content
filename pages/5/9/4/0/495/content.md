An object $E$ of a [[topos]] is called **internally projective** if the functor $(-)^E$ preserves [[epimorphism]]s.  Any [[projective object]] is internally projective.  The _internal axiom of choice_ (that is, the [[axiom of choice]] interpreted in the [[internal logic]] of the topos) is equivalent to the statement that every object is internally projective.  This is strictly weaker than the "external" axiom of choice that every [[epimorphism]] in the topos is [[split epimorphism|split]].
