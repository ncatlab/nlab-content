##Idea

An [[EI (∞,1)-category]] is an [[(∞,1)-category]] in which every [[endomorphism]] is an [[equivalence]]. There is then an ordering $\prec$ on the equivalence classes of objects, where x≺y means that there is a noninvertible map $y \to x$. 

An **inverse EI (∞,1)-category** is an EI (∞,1)-category which is also an [[inverse category|inverse]] (∞,1)-category, that is, is such that $\prec$ is well-founded, i.e., there are no infinite chains of noninvertible maps $ \to \to \to \cdots$.

##Examples

* For a [[compact Lie group]] $G$ the opposite of the [[orbit category]].
* The category of finite sets and surjective maps.

##Related concepts
