## Idea

**Linguistics** is the (scientific) study of natural human language. See a reasonably good page at [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics). It aims to develop a toolbox for description of concrete languages (applied linguistics, descriptive grammar), their classification (language families, language typology) as well as to understand how language functions (e.g. relations to cognition and social constraints) and changes (historical and comparative linguistics). The description of a concrete language includes organizational principles called grammar and distinguished constants called lexic. The grammar is described at several hierarchical levels 
(phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax). 

There is an opposition between 

* individual expressions (Franc. parole) and abstract system of the language (Franc. langage)
* snapshot of a system in time (synchronic) and its development (diachronic)
* knowledge of a language (ability to speak) and knowledge about a language (theoretical description)

Linguistics sign has also a dichotomy between its meaning and its expression. 

Linguistic systems are often also at several levels from personal idiom/idiolect, through social sociolects, regional dialects to languages and language families. There is no fundamental agreement of entirely consistent boundary of what is a boundary level of a language as opposed to dialects or language groups. Also there is no universal criterium of what a boundary of a word is, that is what a word is. 

## Syntax

Syntax is a description of how a received (valid) phrase or sentence is made out of its constituent parts and discipline studying syntax in that sense. 

#### Grammar of formal languages

Linguists may deploy formal methods to analyse the [[syntax (linguistics)]] of natural language (see also [[syntax]] in the sense of logics).

[[formal grammar|Formal grammars]] characterize which [[string (computer science)|strings]] of [[words]] are considered grammatical, they come in many different flavours:

* [[context-free grammar]]

* [[pregroup grammar]]

* [[categorial grammar]]

* [[mildly context-sensitive grammar]]

* [[context-sensitive grammar]]

* [[formal grammar#unrestrictedgrammar|unrestricted grammar]]

These different frameworks come in a hierarchy of expressive power, see [[Chomsky hierarchy]].

## Semantics

Formal theories of meaning are based on the principle of [[compositionality]]: the semantics of a sentence is a function of the meanings of its words, and of its grammatical structure. 

* [[Montague grammar|Montague semantics]]
* [[categorical compositional distributional semantics]]
* [[dependent type theoretic methods in natural language semantics]]

## Pragmatics

Pragmatics is concerned with the meaning of language in context.

* [[language game]]
