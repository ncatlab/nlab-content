**Linguistics** is the (scientific) study of natural human language (this limitation is advocated e.g. by [Andr&#233; Martinet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Martinet)). See a reasonably good page at [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics). 

In [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], we are however also interested in artificial analogues of natural languages: [[formal language|formal]] and [[computer language|computer]] [[language]]s.
