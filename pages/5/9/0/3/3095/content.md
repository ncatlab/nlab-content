**Linguistics** is a (scientific) study of human language (this limitation is advocated e.g. by [Andr&#233; Martinet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Martinet)). See a reasonably good page at [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics). 

In mathematics and computer science, we are however also interested in artificial analogues of natural languages: formal and computer languages.
