## Definition

For $C$ and $D$ two [[categories]], the **product category** $C \times D$ is the category whose

* [[object]]s are ordered pairs $(c,d)$ with $c$ an object of $C$ and $D$ an object of $D$;

* [[morphism]]s are ordered pairs $((c \stackrel{f}{\to} c'),(d \stackrel{g}{\to} d'))$,

* composition of morphisms is defined componentwise by composition in $C$ and $D$.

This operation is the [[cartesian product]] in the 1-category [[Cat]].
