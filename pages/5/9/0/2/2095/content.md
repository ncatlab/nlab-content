Charles Frederick Wells (1937-2017) was a Professor of Mathematics at Case Western Reserve University. His research interests were in [[group theory]], [[category theory]] and its connections with theoretical [[computer science]], in mathematical discourse, and in the problems of teaching and understanding mathematics.
