## Idea

The notion of $(\infty,1)$-category of $(\infty,1)$-sheaves is the generalization of the notion of [[category of sheaves]] from [[category theory]] to the [[higher category theory]] of [[(∞,1)-categories]].

## Definition

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

An **$(\infty,1)$-category of $(\infty,1)$-sheaves** is a [[reflective sub-(∞,1)-category]] 

$$
  Sh(C) \stackrel{\overset{L}{\leftarrow}}{\hookrightarrow}
  PSh(C)
$$

of an [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-presheaves]] such that 

* $L$ is a [[topological localization]];

* equivalently: there is the structure of an [[(∞,1)-site]] on $C$ such that the objects of $Sh(C)$ are precisely those [[(∞,1)-presheaves]] $A$ that are [[local object]]s with respect to the _covering_ [[monomorphism in an (∞,1)-category|monomorphisms]] $p : U \to j(c)$ in $PSh(C)$ in that

  $$
    A(c) \simeq PSh(j(c),A) \stackrel{PSh(p,A)}{\to} PSh(U,A)
  $$

  is an [[(∞,1)-equivalence]] in [[∞Grpd]]. 

  This is the [[descent]] condition and the presheaves satisfying it are the
  **[[(∞,1)-sheaves]]** .
  
  Typically $U$ here is the [[Cech nerve]] 

  $$
    C(\{U_i\}) = \lim_{\to_{[n]}} U_{i_0, \cdots U_{i_n}}
  $$ 

  of a [[covering]] family $\{U_i \to c\}$ 
  (where the colimit is the [[limit in a quasi-category|(∞,1)-categorical colimit]] or [[homotopy colimit]]) so that the above [[descent]] condition becomes 

  $$
    A(c) \simeq PSh(\lim_\to U_\cdots, A)
   \simeq
    \lim_{\leftarrow} A(U_\cdots)
   =
   \lim_{\leftarrow}
   \left(
      \cdots
      \stackrel{\to}{\stackrel{\to}{\to}}
      \prod_{i,j} A(U_i) \times_{A(c)} A(U_j) 
      \stackrel{\to}{\to}\prod_i A(U_i)
   \right)
   \,.
  $$

=--

This is [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, def. 6.2.2.6]].

An $(\infty,1)$-category of $(\infty,1)$-sheaves is an [[(∞,1)-topos]].


## Terminology

Sometimes [[(∞,1)-sheaves]] are called **[[∞-stack]]**s, though sometimes the latter term is reserved for [[hypercomplete]] $(\infty,1)$-sheaves.

The [[(n,1)-category|(n,1)-categorical]] counting is

* [[sheaf]] = 0-stack = 0-[[truncated]] $(\infty,1)$-sheaf

* $(2,1)$-sheaf = [[stack]] = 1-truncated $(\infty,1)$-sheaf

* $(3,1)$-sheaf = 2-stack = 2-truncated $(\infty,1)$-sheaf

* etc.

* $(\infty,1)$-sheaf = [[∞-stack]]  (or = [[hypercomplete]] $(\infty,1)$-sheaf).


## Properties

### General

We reproduce the proof that the two definitions above really are equivalent, i.e. that:

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

For $C$ an [[(∞,1)-site]], the full [[sub-(∞,1)-category]] of $PSh(C)$ on [[local object]]s with respect to the covering monomorphisms in $PSh(C)$ is indeed a [[topological localization]]. and hence $Sh(C)$ is indeed an exact [[reflective sub-(∞,1)-category]] of $PSh(C)$ and hence an [[(∞,1)-topos]]. 

=--

This is [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, lemma 6.2.2.7]]

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Write $S_0$ for the class of covering monomorphisms $U \to j(C)$ in $PSh(C)$ and write $S$ for the <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/reflective+sub-(infinity%2C1)-category#LocalObjects">strongly saturated class</a> that it generates.

Since $PSh(C)$ has all limits, by the <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/reflective+sub-(infinity%2C1)-category#ExactLocalizations">characterization of exact localizations</a> it is sufficient to show that $S$ is closed under [[pullback]].

By the very definition of [[(∞,1)-site]] we have that the covering monomorphisms are stable under pullback along morphisms $j(f) : j(d) \to j(c)$ in the image of the [[(∞,1)-Yoneda embedding]] $j : C \to PSh(C)$. So the task is to show that this statement lifts to pullbacks along arbitrary morphisms $X \to j(c)$ in $PSh(C)$.

For that, let $S' \subset Mor(PSh(C))$ be the collection of morphisms whose pullback lands in $S$. As in the discussion of <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/reflective+sub-(infinity%2C1)-category#ExactLocalizations">exact localizations</a> one finds from the fact that $PSh(C)$ has [[universal colimits]] that $S'$ itself is strongly saturated. Since we need to show that $S \subset S'$ and since $S$ is the smallest strongly saturated class containing $S_0$, it is sufficient to show that $S_0 \subset S'$, i.e. that the pullback of a covering monomorphisms lands in the strong saturation of covering monomorphisms.

This follows by realizing every morphism $X \to j(c)$ as a colimit of representables and then using the stability of covering monomorphisms under pullback along representables to conclude that the pullback of $U \to j(c)$ to $X$ is a colimit of covering monomorphism, hence is in the strongly saturated class generated by them.

We spell this out in more detail.

We want to show that for a [[pullback diagram]]

$$
  \array{
     f^* U = p^* X &\to& U
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow^p 
     \\
     X &\stackrel{f}{\to}& j(c)
  }
$$

with $U \to j(c)$ a covering monomorphism, i.e. in $S_0$, $g^* U \to X$ is in $S$.

Using the <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/(infinity%2C1)-category+of+(infinity%2C1)-presheaves#WithOvercategories">equivalence of presheaves on overcategories</a>

$$
  Sh(C)_{/j(c)} \simeq PSh(C_{/c})
$$

and the [[co-Yoneda lemma]] in $PSh(C_{c})$ we have that every $X \to j(c)$ may be written as a colimit over a [[diagram]]

$$
  \Xi : K \to C_{c} \stackrel{j}{\to} PSh(C_{c}) \simeq PSh(C)_{j(c)}
$$

that factors through the [[Yoneda embedding]].

$$
  X \simeq \lim_\to \Xi
  \,.
$$


Since [colimits in over-categories](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/limits%20and%20colimits%20by%20example#limitsinundercat) $C_{/c}$ are computed as colimits in $C$ under the projection $C_{/c} \to C$, we may write out pullback diagram equivalently as

$$
  \array{
     p^* {\lim_\to}_k \Xi_k &\to& U
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     {\lim_\to}_k \Xi_k &\stackrel{f}{\to}& j(c)
  }
  \;\;\;\;\;\;
  \simeq
  \;\;\;\;\;\;
  \array{
     {\lim_\to}_k p^* \Xi_k &\to& U
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     {\lim_\to}_k \Xi_k &\stackrel{f}{\to}& j(c)
  }  
$$

in $PSh(C)$. Since $PSh(C)$ has [[universal colimits]] the morphism on the left is equivalent to ${\lim_\to}_k p^* \Xi_k \to {\lim_\to}_k \Xi_k$, as indicated above. But, as mentioned before, each component $p^* \Xi_k \to \Xi_k$ is in $S_0$, so this morphism is a colimit in the functor category $Func(\Delta[1], PSh(C))$ over objects in $S_0$. By the definition of strong saturation, this is in $S$.


=--

And conversely:

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition
**(equivalence of site structures and categories of sheaves)**

For $C$ a [[small (∞,1)-category]], there is a bijective correspondence between structure of an [[(∞,1)-site]] on $C$ and equivalence classes of [[topological localization]]s of $PSh(C)$.

=--

This is [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, prop. 6.2.2.9]].

+-- {: .un_lemma}
###### Lemma

For $C$ a small [[(∞,1)-site]] and $Sh(C) \stackrel{\overset{L}{\leftarrow}}{\hookrightarrow} PSh(C)$ the corressponding reflective inclusion of [[(∞,1)-sheaves]] into [[(∞,1)-presheaves]] on $C$ we have that the image under $L$ of a sub-$(\infty,1)$-functor  $p : U \to j(c)$ of a [[representable functor|representable]] $j(c)$ is covering precisely if $L(p)$ is an equivalence.

=--

This is [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, lemma 6.2.2.8]].

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof of the Lemma

Since $Sh(C)$ is the reflectuive localization of $PSh(C)$ at covering monomorphisms, it is clear that if $p : U \to j(c)$ is covering, then $L(p)$ is an equivalence.

To see the converse, form the 0-truncation of $L i$ and conclude as for ordinary sheaves on the [[homotopy category of an (infinity,1)-category|homotopy catgegory]] of $C$.

... 

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof of the Proposition


We have seen in (...) that for every structure of an $(\infty,1)$-site on $C$ we obtain a topological localization of the presheaf category, and that this is an injective map from site structures to equivalence classes of sheaf categories. It remains to show that it is also a surjective map, i.e. that every [[topological localization]] of $PSh(C)$ comes from the structure of an [[(∞,1)-site]] on $C$.

So consider $S \subset Mor(PSh(C))$ a strongly saturated class of morphisms which s topological (closed under pullbacks). Write $S_0 \subset S$ for the subcalss of those that are [[monomorphism in an (infinity,1)-category|monomorphisms]] of the form $U \to j(c)$.

Observe that then $S$ is indeed generated by (is the smallest strongly saturated class containing) $S_0$: since by the [[co-Yoneda lemma]] every object $X \in PSh(C)$ is a colimit $x \simeq {\lim_\to}_k j(\Xi_k)$ over representables. It follows that every monomorphism $f : Y \to X$ is a colimit (in $Func(\Delta[1],PSh(C))$) of those of the form $U \to j(c)$: for consider the pullback diagram 

$$
  \array{
     f^* ({\lim_\to}_k \Xi_k) && Y 
     \\
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq f}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
     \\
     {\lim_\to}_k \Xi_k &\stackrel{\simeq}{\to}& X
  }
  \;\;\;\;\;
  \simeq
  \;\;\;\;\;
  \array{
     ({\lim_\to}_k f^* \Xi_k) && Y 
     \\
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq f}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
     \\
     {\lim_\to}_k \Xi_k &\stackrel{\simeq}{\to}& X
  }
$$

where the equivalence is due to the fact that we have [[universal colimits]] in $PSh(C)$. This realizes $f$ as a colimit over morphisms of the form $f^* j(\Xi_k) \to j(\Xi_k)$ that are each a pullback of a monomorphism. Sincemonomorphisms are stable under pullback, all these component morphisms are themselves monomorphisms.

So every monomorphism in $S$ is generated from $S_0$, but by the assumption that $S$ is topological, it is itself entirely generated from monomorphisms, hence is generated from $S_0$.

So far this establishes that evry topological localization of $PSh(C)$ is a localization at a collection of sieves/ subfunctors $U \to j(c)$ of representables. It remains to show that this collection of subfunctors is indeed an Grothendieck topology and hence exhibits on $C$ the structure of an [[(∞,1)-site]]. We check the necessary three axioms:

1. _equivalences cover_ -- The equivalences $j(c) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} j(c)$ belong to $S$ and are monomorphisms, hence belong to $S_0$.

1. _pullback of a cover is covering_ - Since monomorphisms are stable under pullback, we haave for every $p : U \to j(c)$ in $S$ and every $j(f) : j(d) \to j(c)$ that also the pullback $f^* p$

   $$
     \array{
        f^* U &\to& U
        \\
        \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f^* p}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
        \\
        j(d) &\stackrel{f}{\to}& j(c)
     }
   $$

   is a monomorphism and in $S$, hence in $S_0$.

1. _if restriction of a sieve to a cover is covering, then the sieve is covering_  -- Let $p : U \to j(c)$ be an arbitrary monomorphism and $f : X \to j(d)$ in $S_0$. Write $X \simeq {\lim_\to}_k \Xi_k$ and consider the pullback

   $$
     \array{
       {\lim_\to}_k p^* \Xi_k &\stackrel{p^* f}{\to}&  U
       \\
       \downarrow^{{\lim_\to}_k f_k^* p} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
       \\
       {\lim_\to}_k \Xi_k &\stackrel{f}{\to}& j(c)
     }
     \,,
   $$

   where again we made use of the [[universal colimits]] in $PSh(C)$. Now notice that 

   1. $f$ is in $S$ by assumption;

   1. $p^* f$ is by pullback stability of $S$;

   1. each of the $f_k p$ is in $S$ by assumption, hence ${\lim_k f_k^* p}$
      is by the fact that $S$ is strongly saturated.

   1. so by commutativity $p \circ p^*f$ is in $S$.

   1. finally by 2-out-of-3 this means that $p$ is in $S$.

### Over paracompact topological spaces {#OverParacompactSpaces}

We discuss how $(\infty,1)$-sheaves over a [[paracompact topological space]] are equivalent to topological spaces [[overcategory|over]] $X$. This the analogue of the 1-categorical statement that [[sheaves]] on $X$ are equivalent to [[etale space]]s over $X$: an etale space over $X$ is one whose [[fiber]]s are [[discrete topological space]], hence 0-[[truncated]] spaces. Then [[n-category]] analogy has [[homotopy n-type]]s as fibers. 

+-- {: .un_def}
###### Definition

For $Y \to X$ a [[morphism]] in [[Top]], and $U \in Op(X)$ an [[open subset]] of $X$, write

$$
  Sing_X(Y,U) := Hom_X(U \times \Delta^\bullet, X)
$$

for the [[simplicial set]] (in fact a [[Kan complex]]) of [[continuous map]]s

$$
  \array{
    U \times \Delta^k && \to && Y
    \\
    & \searrow && \swarrow
    \\
    && X
  }
$$

form $U$ times the topological $k$-[[simplex]] $\Delta^k$ into $Y$, that are [[section]]s of $Y \to X$.

=--

This is a relative version of the [[singular simplicial complex]] functor.

+-- {: .un_prop #OverTopModelStructure}
###### Proposition

Let $(X, \mathcal{B})$ be a [[topological space]] equipped with a [[base for the topology]] $\mathcal{B}$.

There is a [[model category]] structure on the [[over category]] $Top/X$ with weak equivalences and fibration precisely those morphisms $Y \to Z$ over $X$ such that for each $U \in \mathcal{B}$ the induced morphism $Sing_X(Y,U) \to Sing_X(Z,U)$ is a weak equivalence or fibration, respectively, in the standar [[model structure on simplicial sets]].

=--

This is [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, prop 7.1.2.1]].

Write $(Top/X)^\circ$ for the [[(∞,1)-category]] [[locally presentable (∞,1)-category|presented]] by this model structure.

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

Let $X$ be a [[paracompact topological space]] and write as usual $Sh_{(\infty,1)}(X) := Sh_{(\infty,1)}(Op(X))$ for the $(\infty,1)$-category of $(\infty,1)$-sheaves on the [[category of open subsets]] of $X$; equipped with the canonical structure of a [[site]].

Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of **$F_\sigma$-open subsets** of $X$. This are those [[open subset]]s that are countable unions of [[closed subset]]s, equivalently the 0-sets of [[continuous function]]s $X \to [0,1]$.

Let $Top/X^\circ$ be the corresponding $(\infty,1)$-categoty according to the [above proposition](#OverTopModelStructure). Then $Sing_X(-,-)$ constitutes  an [[equivalence of (∞,1)-categories]]

$$
  Top/X^\circ \simeq Sh_{(\infty,1)}(X)
  \,.
$$

This is [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, corollary 7.1.4.4]].

### Difference to more general $(\infty,1)$-toposes {#DiffToOthers}

The [[(∞,1)-topos]]es that are $(\infty,1)$-categories of sheaves, i.e. that arise by [[topological localization]] from an [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-presheaves]], enjoy  a number of special properties over other classes of $(\infty,1)$-toposes, such as notably [[hypercomplete (∞,1)-topos]]es.

The following lists these properties. ([[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, section 6.5.4]].)

#### Universal property

The construction of [[(∞,1)-sheaf]] [[(∞,1)-topos]]es on a given [[locale]] is singled out over the construction of other kinds of $(\infty,1)$-toposes (such as [[hypercomplete (∞,1)-topos]]es) by the following universal property:

forming $(\infty,1)$-sheaves is, roughly, [[right adjoint]] to the functor $\tau_{\leq -1}$ that sends each $(\infty,1)$-topos to its underlying [[locale]] of [[subobject]]s of the [[terminal object]].

See [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, item 1) of section 6.5.4]].

For $X,Y$ two $(\infty,1)$-toposes, write $Geom(X,Y) \subset Func(X,Y)$ for the full [[sub-(∞,1)-category]] of the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-functors]] on those that are [[geometric morphism]]s.


+-- {: .un_lemma}
###### Lemma

For $C$ an [[essentially small (∞,1)-category|small]] [[(n,1)-category]] equipped with the structure of an [[(∞,1)-site]] and for $Y$ an [[(∞,1)-topos]], the [[truncated|truncation functor]]

$$
  \tau_{\leq n-1} : 
  Geom(Y, Sh(C)) \to Geom(\tau_{\leq n-1} Y, \tau_{\leq n-1} Sh(C))
$$

is an [[equivalence in a quasi-category|equivalence]] (of [[(∞,1)-categories]]).


=--

This is [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, lemma 6.4.5.6]].

See also [[n-localic (∞,1)-topos]].



#### Compact generation


+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

Let $X$ be a [[coherent topological space]] and let $Op(X)$ be its [[category of open subsets]] with the standard structure of an [[(∞,1)-site]].

Then $Sh_{(\infty,1)}(X) := Sh_{(\infty,1)}(Op(X))$ is _compactly generated_ in that it is generated by [[filtered colimit]]s of [[compact object]]s.

Moreover, the compact objects of $Sh_{(\infty,1)}(X)$ are those that are [[stalk]]wise compact objects in [[∞Grpd]] and [[locally constant ∞-stack|locally constant]] along a suitable [[stratification]] of $X$.

=--

This is [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, prop. 6.5.4.4]].


This statement is false for the [[hypercompletion]] of $Sh_{(\infty,1)}(X)$, in general.


#### Nonabelian cohomology {#NonabelianCohomology}

For $X$ a [[topological space]], let

$$
  (LConst \dashv \Gamma) :  Sh_{(\infty,1)}(X)
  \stackrel{\overset{LConst}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma}{\to}}
$$

be the [[global section]]s terminal [[geometric morphism]]. 

For $A \in \infty Grpd$, the ([[nonabelian cohomology|nonabelian]]) [[cohomology]] of $X$ with coefficients in $A$ is usually defined in [[∞Grpd]] as

$$
  H(X,A) := \pi_0 Func(Sing X, A)
  \,,
$$

where $Sing X$ is the [[fundamental ∞-groupoid]] of $X$. On the other hand, if we send $A$ into $Sh_{(\infty,1)}(X)$ via $LConst$, the there is the _intrinsic_ [[cohomology]] of the $(\infty,1)$-topos $Sh_{(\infty,1)}(X)$ 
  
$$
  H'(X,A) := \pi_0 Sh_{(\infty,1)}(X)(X, LConst A)
  \,.
$$

Noticing that $X$ is in fact the [[terminal object]] of $Sh_{(\infty,1)}(X)$ and that $Sh_{(\infty,1)}(X)(X,-)$ is in fact that [[global section]]s functor, this is equivalently

$$
  \cdots \simeq \pi_0 \Gamma LConst A
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .un_theorem }
###### Theorem

If $X$ is a [[paracompact space]], then these two definitins of [[nonabelian cohomology]] of $X$ with [[constant ∞-stack|constant coefficients]] $A \in \infty Grpd$ agree:

$$
  H(X,A) := \pi_0 \infty Grpd(Sing X,A)  \simeq Sh_{(\infty,1)}(X)(X,LConst A)
  \,.
$$

=--

This is [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, theorem 7.1.0.1]].


## Models 


The topological localizations of an [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-presheaves]] are [[presentable (∞,1)-category|presented]] by the [[Bousfield localization of model categories|left Bousfield localization]] of the global [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] at the set of [[Cech cover]]s.

The [[hypercompletion|hypercomplete]] $(\infty,1)$-sheaf toposes are [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presented]] by the local Joyal-Jardine [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]]. 

Detailed discussion of this [[model category]] presentation is at
