## Idea

The notion of $(\infty,1)$-category of $(\infty,1)$-sheaves is the generalization of the notion of [[category of sheaves]] from [[category theory]] to the [[higher category theory]] of [[(∞,1)-categories]].

## Definition

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

An **$(\infty,1)$-category of $(\infty,1)$-sheaves** is a [[reflective sub-(∞,1)-category]] 

$$
  Sh(C) \stackrel{\overset{L}{\leftarrow}}{\hookrightarrow}
  PSh(C)
$$

of an [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-presheaves]] such that 

* $L$ is a [[topological localization]];

* equivalently: there is the structure of an [[(∞,1)-site]] on $C$ such that the objects of $Sh(C)$ are precisely those [[(∞,1)-presheaves]] $A$ that are [[local object]]s with respect to the _covering_ [[monomorphism in an (∞,1)-category|monomorphisms]] $p : U \to j(c)$ in $PSh(C)$ in that

  $$
    A(c) \simeq PSh(j(c),A) \stackrel{PSh(p,A)}{\to} PSh(U,A)
  $$

  is an [[(∞,1)-equivalence]] in [[∞Grpd]]. 

  This is the [[descent]] condition and the presheaves satisfying it are the
  **[[(∞,1)-sheaves]]** .


=--

This is [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, def. 6.2.2.6]].

An $(\infty,1)$-category of $(\infty,1)$-sheaves is an [[(∞,1)-topos]].


## Terminology

Sometimes [[(∞,1)-sheaves]] are called **[[∞-stack]]**s, though sometimes the latter term is reserved for [[hypercomplete]] $(\infty,1)$-sheaves.

The [[(n,1)-category|(n,1)-categorical]] counting is

* [[sheaf]] = 0-stack = 0-[[truncated]] $(\infty,1)$-sheaf

* $(2,1)$-sheaf = [[stack]] = 1-truncated $(\infty,1)$-sheaf

* $(3,1)$-sheaf = 2-stack = 2-truncated $(\infty,1)$-sheaf

* etc.

* $(\infty,1)$-sheaf = [[∞-stack]]  (or = [[hypercomplete]] $(\infty,1)$-sheaf).


## Properties

We reproduce the proof that the two definitions above really are equivalent, i.e. that:

###### Proposition

For $C$ an [[(∞,1)-site]], the full [[sub-(∞,1)-category]] of $PSh(C)$ on [[local object]]s with respect to the covering monomorphisms in $PSh(C)$ is indeed a [[topological localization]]. and hence $Sh(C)$ is indeed an exact [[reflective sub-(∞,1)-category]] of $PSh(C)$ and hence an [[(∞,1)-topos]]. 

=--

This is [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, lemma 6.2.2.7]]

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Write $S_0$ for the class of covering monomorphisms $U \to j(C)$ in $PSh(C)$ and write $S$ for the <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/reflective+sub-(infinity%2C1)-category#LocalObjects">strongly saturated class</a> that it generates.

Since $PSh(C)$ has all limits, by the <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/reflective+sub-(infinity%2C1)-category#ExactLocalizations">characterization of exact localizations</a> it is sufficient to show that $S$ is closed under [[pullback]].

By the very definition of [[(∞,1)-site]] we have that the covering monomorphisms are stable under pullback along morphisms $j(f) : j(d) \to j(c)$ in the image of the [[(∞,1)-Yoneda embedding]] $j : C \to PSh(C)$. So the task is to show that this statement lifts to pullbacks along arbitrary morphisms $X \to j(c)$ in $PSh(C)$.

For that, let $S' \subset Mor(PSh(C))$ be the collection of morphisms whose pullback lands in $S$. As in the discussion of <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/reflective+sub-(infinity%2C1)-category#ExactLocalizations">exact localizations</a> one finds from the fact that $PSh(C)$ has [[universal colimits]] that $S'$ itself is strongly saturated. Since we need to show that $S \subset S'$ and since $S$ is the smallest strongly saturated class containing $S_0$, it is sufficient to show that $S_0 \subset S'$, i.e. that the pullback of a covering monomorphisms lands in the strong saturation of covering monomorphisms.

This follows by realizing every morphism $X \to j(c)$ as a colimit of representables and then using the stability of covering monomorphisms under pullback along representables to conclude that the pullback of $U \to j(c)$ to $X$ is a colimit of covering monomorphism, hence is in the strongly saturated class generated by them.

We spell this out in more detail.

We want to show that for a [[pullback diagram]]

$$
  \array{
     f^* U = p^* X &\to& U
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow^p 
     \\
     X &\stackrel{f}{\to}& j(c)
  }
$$

with $U \to j(c)$ a covering monomorphism, i.e. in $S_0$, $g^* U \to X$ is in $S$.

Using the <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/(infinity%2C1)-category+of+(infinity%2C1)-presheaves#WithOvercategories">equivalence of presheaves on overcategories</a>

$$
  Sh(C)_{/j(c)} \simeq PSh(C_{/c})
$$

and the [[co-Yoneda lemma]] in $PSh(C_{c})$ we have that every $X \to j(c)$ may be written as a colimit over a [[diagram]]

$$
  \Xi : K \to C_{c} \stackrel{j}{\to} PSh(C_{c}) \simeq PSh(C)_{j(c)}
$$

that factors through the [[Yoneda embedding]].

$$
  X \simeq \lim_\to \Xi
  \,.
$$


Since [colimits in over-categories](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/limits%20and%20colimits%20by%20example#limitsinundercat) $C_{/c}$ are computed as colimits in $C$ under the projection $C_{/c} \to C$, we may write out pullback diagram equivalently as

$$
  \array{
     p^* {\lim_\to}_k \Xi_k &\to& U
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     {\lim_\to}_k \Xi_k &\stackrel{f}{\to}& j(c)
  }
  \;\;\;\;\;\;
  \simeq
  \;\;\;\;\;\;
  \array{
     {\lim_\to}_k p^* \Xi_k &\to& U
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     {\lim_\to}_k \Xi_k &\stackrel{f}{\to}& j(c)
  }  
$$

in $PSh(C)$. Since $PSh(C)$ has [[universal colimits]] the morphism on the left is equivalent to ${\lim_\to}_k p^* \Xi_k \to {\lim_\to}_k \Xi_k$, as indicated above. But, as mentioned before, each component $p^* \Xi_k \to \Xi_k$ is in $S_0$, so this morphism is a colimit in the functor category $Func(\Delta[1], PSh(C))$ over objects in $S_0$. By the definition of strong saturation, this is in $S$.

###### Proposition
**(equivalence of site structures and categories of sheaves)**

For $C$ a [[small (∞,1)-category]], there is a bijective correspondence between structure of an [[(∞,1)-site]] on $C$ and equivalence classes of [[topological localization]]s of $PSh(C)$.

This is [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, prop. 6.2.2.9]].

+-- {: .un_lemma}
###### Lemma

For $C$ a small [[(∞,1)-site]] and $Sh(C) \stackrel{\overset{L}{\leftarrow}}{\hookrightarrow} PSh(C)$ the corressponding reflective inclusion of [[(∞,1)-sheaves]] into [[(∞,1)-presheaves]] on $C$ we have that the image under $L$ of a sub-$(\infty,1)$-functor  $p : U \to j(c)$ of a [[representable functor|representable]] $j(c)$ is covering precisely if $L(p)$ is an equivalence.

=--

This is [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, lemma 6.2.2.8]].

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof of the Lemma

Since $Sh(C)$ is the reflectuive localization of $PSh(C)$ at covering monomorphisms, it is clear that if $p : U \to j(c)$ is covering, then $L(p)$ is an equivalence.

To see the converse, form the 0-truncation of $L i$ and conclude as for ordinary sheaves on the [[homotopy category of an (infinity,1)-category|homotopy catgegory]] of $C$.

###### Proof of the Proposition


We have seen in (...) that for every structure of an $(\infty,1)$-site on $C$ we obtain a topological localization of the presheaf category, and that this is an injective map from site structures to equivalence classes of sheaf categories. It remains to show that it is also a surjective map, i.e. that every [[topological localization]] of $PSh(C)$ comes from the structure of an [[(∞,1)-site]] on $C$.

To see this, consider...

## Models 


The topological localizations of an [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-presheaves]] are [[presentable (∞,1)-category|presented]] by the [[Bousfield localization of model categories|left Bousfield localization]] of the global [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] at the set of [[Cech cover]]s.

The [[hypercompletion|hypercomplete]] $(\infty,1)$-sheaf toposes are [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presented]] by the local Joyal-Jardine [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]]. 

Detailed discussion of this [[model category]] presentation is at 

* [[models for infinity-stack (infinity,1)-toposes|models for (infinity,1)-category of (infinity,1)-sheaves]] .

## References

The study of simplicial presheaves apparently goes back to 

* K. Brown, [[BrownAHT|Abstract Homotopy Theory and Generalized Sheaf Cohomology]]

which considers locally [[Kan complex|Kan]] [[simplicial presheaf|simplicial presheaves]] as a [[category of fibrant objects]].

This was later conceived in terms of a [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] and on simplicial sheaves by Joyal and Jardine. To&#235; summarizes the situation and emphasizes the interpretation in terms of [[∞-stacks]] living in $(\infty,1)$-categories for instance in
