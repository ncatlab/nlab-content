## Idea

The  [[compact object in an (infinity,1)-category|compact objects]]in [[âˆžGrpd]] are the [[retracts]] of [[finite homotopy types]] ([[finite CW-complexes]]). Not every such retract is itself a finite homotopy type; the vanishing of _Wall's finiteness [[obstruction]] is a necessary and sufficient condition for this to happen.
