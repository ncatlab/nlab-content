Given a [[commutative unital ring]] $R$, a filtration $M_n$ ($n\geq -1$) on a $R$-$R$-[[bimodule]] $M$ is a __differential filtration__ if the commutator $[r,P]$ for any $P$ in $M_n$ is in $M_{n-1}$, and $M_{-1} = 0$. A bimodule is __differential__ if it has an exhaustive ($\bigcup_n M_n = M$) differential filtration. Every $R$-$R$-bimodule has a __differential part__, i.e. the maximal differential submodule of $M$. The principal example of a differential bimodule is the ring of [[regular differential operators]] defined by [[Grothendieck]]. 

There is a generalization in categorical setup developed by Lunts and Rosenberg in

If a noncommutative [[scheme]]-like geometric object $X$ is represented by an [[abelian category]], $C_X$ then morphism of schemes should correspond to pairs of [[adjoint functors]], in fact bimodules (cf. the [[Eilenberg-Watts theorem]]). Then one considers thickenings of the diagonal ...
