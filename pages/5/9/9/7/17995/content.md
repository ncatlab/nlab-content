Given a [[bundle]] $p \colon E \to X$, and a morphism $f \colon Y \to X$, then the _pullback bundle_ $f^\ast E \to Y$ is (if it exists) simply the [[pullback]] of $p$ along $f$, regarded as a [[bundle]] over $Y$.

## Universal bundles

Over a [[compact topological space]] then every [[vector bundle]] is [[isomoprhism|isomorphic]] to a pullback bundle of a [[universal vector bundle]] over a [[classifying space]]. See there for more.
