A subset $F$ of a [[lattice]] $L$ is called a __filter__ if it satisfies the axioms dual to the axioms of an ideal:

(i) If $A\lt B$ and $A\in F$ then $B\in F$

(ii) $1\in F$

(iii) if $A\in F$, $B\in F$ then $A\vee B \in F$

If a complement of an ideal is a filter then we say that the ideal is prime and (equivalently) that the filter is prime.

In [[nonstandard analysis]] and [[model theory]] particularly important class of filters are [[ultrafilter]]s.
