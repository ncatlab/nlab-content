* [[Jacob Lurie]], _Deformation theory_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/0709.3091))

on the notions of [[deformation theory]] -- such as [[Kähler differentials]] and [[cotangent complex]]es -- generalized from the ordinary context of [[algebra]] to that of [[higher algebra]]. In particular it studies the case where ordinary [[rings]] are replaced by [[E-∞ rings]].
