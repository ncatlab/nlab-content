* [[Jacob Lurie]], _Deformation theory_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/0709.3091))

on the notions of [[deformation theory]] -- such as [[Kähler differential]]s and [[cotangent complex]]es -- generalized from the ordinary context of [[algebra]] to that of [[higher algebra]]. In particular it studies the case where ordinary [[ring]]s are replaced by [[E-∞ ring]]s.
