## Meanings

In [[category theory]], 
the prefix "bi-" is used in several ways with different (and not always compatible) meanings.

### Weak 2-dimensional

Here, "bi-" is used to denote a weak 2-dimensional analogue of a 1-categorical concept.

Examples:

- [[bicategory]]
- [[biadjunction]]
- [[bilimit]]

In some cases, the prefix "pseudo-" may be used instead, such as [[pseudoadjunction]] rather than [[biadjunction]]. However, be warned that in some cases, these (unfortunately) refer to different concepts: e.g. a [[pseudolimit]] is a [[bilimit]], but the converse is not always true.

### X and also co-X

Here, "bi-X" is used to denote a structure that is equipped with both X-[[structure]] and [[formal duality|dual]] co-X-structure (for some definition X) that *do not necessarily coincide*.

Examples:

- [[bicartesian category]]

- [[bireflective subcategory]]

- [[bifibrant objects]]

- [[bifibration]]

An unambiguous alternative is to simply be explicit about both structures being assumed.


### Compatible X and co-X

Here, "bi-X" is used to denote a structure that is equipped with X-structure and co-X structure (not coincident) that verify some compatibility. 

Examples:

- [[bimonoid]]
- [[Hopf monad|bimonad]]

In many cases, these concepts have different, unambiguous names (such as [[Hopf monad]]) that may be used instead.

### Coincident X and co-X

Here, "bi-X" is used to denote a structure that is equipped with X-structure and co-X-structure that coincides. This is a particularly common special case of the meaning above.

Examples:

- [[bilimit]]
- [[biproduct]]

An alternative, unambiguous prefix that can be used for this meaning is "ambi-".

### Left-X and also right-X

In some settings without symmetry, "bi-X" is occasionally used to denote having X-structure on the left and also X-structure on the right (not coincident).

Examples:

- **biclosed**
- [[bimodule]]
- [[bicomodule]]

In such settings, it is unambiguous to simply elide the prefix "bi-". E.g. one can simply write "[[closed category|closed]]" to mean left- and right-closed.

Note that this is not the same as "X and co-X" (except in the [[delooping]]): a "biclosed category" with this terminology would be one that is [[closed category|closed]] and [[coclosed category|coclosed]].

Some compatibility may be required between the left and right X-structures.

### Two compatible X structures

A less common usage is the prefix "bi-" to mean two structures of the same kind that interact in some way.

Examples:

- **bimonoidal category** (i.e. [[rig category]])

However, these examples tend to have alternative, more descriptive terminology.
