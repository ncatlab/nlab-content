## Idea

In [[number theory]], an **evil number** is a [[natural number]] that has an even number of ones in its binary [[radix expansion]]. 

The term "evil number" was chosen by the authors of [Berlekamp, Conway, & Guy 2001](#BCG01) because the two first letters of "evil" were the same as that of "[[even number]]".
