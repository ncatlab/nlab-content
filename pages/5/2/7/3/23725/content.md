## Idea

Given a [[crystal|crystalline]] material, its *Brioullin torus* is the [[space]] of distinguishable [[momenta]]/[[wave vectors]] of its [[electron|electronic]] excitations. Due to the periodicity of the crystal, also these momenta/wave vectors are (dually) periodically identified, which makes this space an [[n-torus]].

Mathematically, the [[discrete space]] underlying a [[crystal]] is a [[subset]] of a [[Euclidean space]] $S \;\subset\;E^n \simeq \mathbb{R}^n$ (the set of *atomic sites*) which is preserved (as a subset) by the [[group action|action]] of a [[crystallographic group]] $\Lambda \rtimes G \,\subset\, Iso(E)$, where $\Lambda$ is a full [[lattice in a vector space|lattice]] (and $G$ the corresponding [[point group]]). Then its Brillouin torus is the [[Pontrjagin dual group]] of this lattice (eg. [Freed-Moore 13](#FreedMoore13)):

$$
  \mathbb{T}^n_{Br} \,=\, Hom_{Grp}\big(\Lambda, \, S^1 \big)
  \,.
$$
