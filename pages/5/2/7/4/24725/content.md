## Idea

The **1lab** is an online reference maintained by [[Am√©lia Liao]] primarily for [[category theory]] done in [[univalent type theory|univalent]] [[cubical type theory]] implemented in [[cubical Agda]]. 

Web:

* [1lab website](https://1lab.dev/)

* [Github page for the 1lab](https://github.com/plt-amy/1lab)

The name "1lab" is apparently a reference to (the name of) the "[[nLab|$n$Lab]]", with the specification $n = 1$ meant to highlight the focus on [[univalent category|type-theoretic]] [[1-categories]] (as opposed to [[higher category theory|higher categories]], whose type-theoretic formulation remains underdeveloped, generally).
