An __$(\infty,2)$-category__ is the special case of $(\infty,n)$-[[(infinity,n)-category|category]] for $n=2$.

It is best known now through a [[geometric definition of higher category]].

Models include 
* the definition by [[Carlos Simpson]] and Tamsamani;
* the definition in terms of [[n-fold Segal space]]s;
* a definition in terms of scaled simplicial sets, following Verity's [[simplicial model for weak omega-categories]] by Jacob Lurie (see reference below)

See also the list of all definitions of higher categories at [[n-category]].
