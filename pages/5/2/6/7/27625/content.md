## Idea

The concept of an [[initial object]] in [[simplicial type theory]]. Note that in the context of simplicial type theory, initial objects make sense for any type, not just the [[Segal types]]. 

## Definition

Let $A$ be a type in [[simplicial type theory]]. An element $x:A$ is an **initial object** if for all elements $y:A$, the [[hom-type]] $\mathrm{hom}_A(x, y)$ is a [[contractible type]]. 

If $A$ is a [[Segal type]] then this notion coincides with the usual notion of [[initial object in an (infinity,1)-category]].
