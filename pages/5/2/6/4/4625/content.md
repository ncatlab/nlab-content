The __empty category__ is [[the]] [[category]] with no [[objects]] (and hence no [[morphisms]]).  It is a [[groupoid]], so we may call it the __empty groupoid__.  One can similarly speak of the __empty $n$-category__, the __empty $\infty$-groupoid__, etc etc etc.

The empty category is [[discrete category|discrete]], hence may be identified with a [[set]]: the [[empty set]].  This set is a [[subsingleton]], so we may also identify it with a [[truth value]]: the [[false]] one.

The empty category is [[initial object|initial]] in [[Cat]] (as well as [[Grpd]], [[∞Grpd]], [[Set]], etc).
