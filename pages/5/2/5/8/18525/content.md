## Definition


Let $X$ be a [[smooth manifold]] and let $D$ be a [[differential operator]] on (smooth [[sections]] of) the [[trivial line bundle]] over $X$. Then the [[symbol of a differential operator|symbol]] $q(D)$ of $D$ is equivalently a [[smooth function]] on the [[cotangent bundle]] $T^\ast X$ (by [this example](symbol+of+a+differential+operator#BicharacteristicFlow)). With the [[cotangent bundle]] canonically regarded as a [[symplectic manifold]], let 

$$
  v_{q(D)} \in \Gamma(T(T^\ast X))
$$ 

be the corresponding [[Hamiltonian vector field]].

###### Definition

The _bicharacteristic flow_ of $D$ is the [[Hamiltonian flow|Hamiltonian]] [[flow of a vector field|flow]] of the [[Hamiltonian vector field]] $v_{q(D)}$. Moreover:

1. A single [[flow line]] in $T^\ast X$ is called a _bicharacteristic strip_ of $D$, 

1. the [[projection]] of such to a [[curve]] in $X$ is called a _bicharacteristic curve_.

1. The [[relation]] $C$ on $T^\ast X$ given by

   $$
     \left((x_1,k_1) \sim (x_2, k_2)\right)
     \;\coloneqq\;
     \left(
       q(x_i,k_i) = 0
       \;\;\text{and}\;\;
       (x_1,k_1) \,\text{is connected to}\,
       (x_2,k_2) \,\text{by a bicharacteristic strip}
     \right)
   $$

   is called the _bicharacteristic relation_.

## Examples

###### Example
**(bicharacteristic curves of [[wave operator]]/[[Klein-Gordon operators]] are the [[lightlike]] [[geodesics]])**

Let $(X,e)$ be a [[Lorentzian manifold]] and let $D \coloneqq \Box_e + m^2$ be its [[wave operator]]/[[Klein-Gordon operator]]. Then the bicharacteristic curves of $D$ (def. \ref{BicharacteristicFlow}) are precisely the [[lightlike]] [[geodesics]] of $(X,e)$, and the bicharacteristic strips are precisely these geodesices with their [[cotangent vectors]].

Accordingly two cotangent vectors are bicharacteristically related $(x_1,k_1) \sim (x_2,k_2)$ precisely if there is a [[lightlike]] [[geodesic]] connecting the points, with $k_1$ and $k_2$ the corresponding cotangents, hence one the result of [[parallel transport]] of the other along the geodesic.

## Properties

### Propagation of singularities

The _[[propagation of singularities theorem]]_ says that the [[wave front set]] of a [[distribution|distributional]] solution to the [[differential equation]] of a (suitably nice) [[differential operator]] is preserved by the bicharacteristic flow.
