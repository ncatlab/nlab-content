## Idea

In [[variational calculus]] the  **Euler-Lagrange [[equations]]** of a [[nonlinear functional]] arising from [[transgression of variational differential forms|transgression]] of a [[local Lagrangian density]] characterize the _[[extrema]]_ of that functional, hence its _[[critical locus]]_ (the "[[shell]]"). 

This originates from and is mainly used in [[physics]], specifically in [[Lagrangian field theory]], where the functional in question is the _[[action functional]]_ of a [[physical system]], and where its critical points encode the physically realized [[field histories]] by the _[[principle of extremal action]]_.

## Examples
