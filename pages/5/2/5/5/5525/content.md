## Idea

The term _discrete $\infty$-groupoid_ is essentially synonymous to just _[[∞-groupoid]]_ . It is used for emphasis in a context where there might be extra [[stuff, structure, property|structure]] to indicate that this extra structure is being disregarded.

## Definition

Given any [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] 

$$
  (Disc \dashv \Gamma) : \mathbf{H}  \stackrel{\overset{Disc}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma}{\to}}
  \infty Grpd
$$

the [[inverse image]] $Disc$ of the [[global section]] functor is a [[full and faithful (∞,1)-functor]] and hence embeds [[∞Grpd]] as a full [[sub-(∞,1)-category]] of $\mathbf{H}$. A general object in $\mathbd{H}$ is a _cohesive $\infty$-groupoid_ . We say _discrete $\infty$-groupoid_ for the objects in the essential image of $Disc$. These are the $\infty$-groupoids with _[[discrete space|discrete]] cohesive_ structure.

This generalizes the traditional use of the word [[discrete group]].
