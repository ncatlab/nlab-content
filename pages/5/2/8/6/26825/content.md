__Zbigniew Semadeni__ is a Polish mathematician. His work is mainly in [[functional analysis]] often with extensive usage of [[order theory]] and [[category theory]].

## Selected works

The following monograph has many ideas emphasising the [[duality between algebra and geometry|duality]] between [[function algebras]] and [[topological spaces]] and including many early ideas in [[noncommutative geometry]]. Unfortunately only the first volume ever appeared.
