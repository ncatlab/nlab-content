### Finite-dimensional spheres


+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

The $n$-dimensional unit **sphere** , or simply **$n$-sphere**, is the [[topological space]] given by the [[subset]] of the $(n+1)$-dimensional [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ consisting of all points $x$ whose distance from the origin is $1$

$$ 
  S^n = \{ x: \mathbb{R}^{n+1} \;|\; \|x\| = 1 \} 
  \,.
$$

The $n$-dimensional sphere of radius $r$ is
$$ S^n_r = \{ x: \mathbb{R}^{n+1} \;|\; \|x\| = r \} .$$
Topologically, this is equivalent ([[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]]) to the unit sphere for $r \gt 0$, or a [[point]] for $r = 0$.

This is naturally a [[smooth manifold]] of [[dimension]] $n$, with the [[smooth structure]] induced by the standard smooth structure on $\mathbb{R}^n$.

=--



### Infinite dimensional spheres 
 {#InfiniteDimensionalSphere}

One can also talk about the [[infinite-dimensional sphere]] in an arbitrary (possibly infinite-dimensional) [[normed vector space]] $V$:
$$ S(V) = \{ x: V \;\text{such that}\; {\|x\|} = 1 \} .$$

If a [[LCTVS|locally convex topological vector space]] admits a continuous linear injection into a [[normed vector space]], this can be used to define its sphere.  If not, one can still define the sphere as a *quotient* of the space of non-zero vectors under the scalar action of $(0,\infty)$.

Homotopy theorists (e.g. [tom Dieck 2008, example 8.3.7](#tomDieck2008)) define $S^\infty$ as the [[directed colimit]] of the $S^n$:
$$ S^{-1} \hookrightarrow S^0 \hookrightarrow S^1 \hookrightarrow S^2 \hookrightarrow \cdots S^\infty .$$
Note that this $S^\infty$ is _not_ homeomorphic to the sphere of any metrizable space as defined above, since the metrizable [[CW complex|CW-complexes]] are precisely the  locally finite [[CW complex|CW-complexes]] ([Fritsch–Piccinini 1990: 48, prop. 1.5.17](#FP1990)), which [$S^\infty$ is not](#CWstructures) (every open $n$-cell intersects all closed $m$-cells with $m \ge n$)

In themselves, infinite-dimensional spheres provide nothing new to [[homotopy theory]], as they are at least weakly contractible and usually [[contractible space|contractible]].  However, they are a very useful source of big contractible spaces and so are often used as a starting point for making concrete models of [[classifying spaces]].

If the vector space is a [[shift space]], then contractibility is straightforward to prove.

+-- {: .num_theorem #theorem}
###### Theorem
Let $V$ be a [[shift space]] of some order.  Let $S V$ be its sphere (either via a norm or as the quotient of non-zero vectors).  Then $S V$ is contractible.
=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
Let $T \colon V \to V$ be a [[shift map]].  The idea is to homotop the sphere onto the image of $T$, and then down to a point.

It is simplest to start with the non-zero vectors, $V \setminus \{0\}$.  As $T$ is injective, it restricts to a map from this space to itself which commutes with the scalar action of $(0,\infty)$.  Define a homotopy $H \colon [0,1] \times (V \setminus
 \{0\}) \to V \setminus \{0\}$ by $H_t(v) = (1 - t)v + t T v$.  It is clear that, assuming it is well-defined, it is a homotopy from the identity to $T$.  To see that it is well-defined, we need to show that $H_t(v)$ is never zero.  The only place where it could be zero would be on an eigenvector of $T$, but as $T$ is a [[shift map]] then it has none.

As $T$ is a [[shift map]], it is not surjective and so we can pick some $v_0$ not in its image.  Then we define a homotopy $G \colon [0,1] \times (V \setminus \{0\}) \to V \setminus \{0\}$ by $G_t(v) = (1 - t)T v + t v_0$.  As $v_0$ is not in the image of $T$, this is well-defined on $V \setminus \{0\}$.  Combining these two homotopies results in the desired contraction of $V \setminus \{0\}$.

If $V$ admits a suitable function defining a spherical subset (such as a norm) then we can modify the above to a contraction of the spherical subset simply by dividing out by this function.  If not, as the homotopies above all commute with the scalar action of $(0,\infty)$, they descend to the definition of the sphere as the quotient of $V \setminus \{0\}$.

## Properties

### Basic

* The $n$-sphere is the [[boundary]] of the $(n+1)$-[[ball]].

* These spheres, or rather their underlying [[topological spaces]] or [[simplicial set|simplicial sets]], are fundamental in (ungeneralised) [[homotopy theory]].  In a sense, [[Whitehead's theorem]] says that these are all that you need; no further [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) homotopy theory|generalised homotopy theory]] (in a sense [[Eckmann–Hilton duality|dual]] to [[Eilenberg–Steenrod cohomology theory]]) is needed.

* [[positive dimension spheres are H-cogroup objects]], and this is the origin of the [[group]] structure on [[homotopy groups]]).

\begin{proposition}
The [[topological complexity]] of the sphere is
\[
  \label{TopologicalComplexityOfSpheres}
    TC
    \big(
      S^n
    \big)
    \;=\;
    \left\{
    \begin{array}{ll}
       2 & ; n \quad odd
       \\
       3 & ; n \quad even
    \end{array}
    \right.
\]
\end{proposition}

([Farber 01, Theorem 8](#Farber01))

This proposition can be generalized:

\begin{proposition}
The [[topological complexity]] of a product of spheres is
\[
  \label{TopologicalComplexityOfProductOfSpheres}
    TC
    \big(
      (S^m)^n
    \big)
    \;=\;
    \left\{
    \begin{array}{ll}
       n+1 & ; m \quad odd
       \\
       2n+1 & ; m \quad even
    \end{array}
    \right.
\]
\end{proposition}

([Farber 01, Theorem 13](#Farber01))

A special case of this proposition is $TC(T^n)=n+1$ for the [[topological complexity]] of the [[torus]].

### CW-structures
 {#CWstructures}

The $n$-sphere is an [[dimension of a cell complex|$n$-dimensional]] [[CW complex]] in several ways:

* The $n$-sphere ($n \ge 0$) admits, for every point $x_0 \in S^n $, a [[CW complex|CW-structure]] with one $0$-cell $x_0$ and one $n$-cell $S^n \setminus \{ x_0 \}$, by [[stereographic projection]]. ([tom Dieck 2008, example 8.3.7](#tomDieck2008))

* The $n$-sphere ($n \ge 0$) can also be constructed from the $(n-1)$-sphere by attaching $n$-cells (the north and south hemispheres) to the equator $(n-1)$-sphere. Iteratively applying this construction starting with $S^{-1}=\varnothing$ yields a [[CW complex]] $S^n$ with two $k$-cells in each dimension $k \le n$, and subcomplex inclusions $S^n \subseteq S^{n+1}$ for all $n \in \mathbf{N}$; the colimit of this sequence is (by definition) $S^\infty$. ([tom Dieck 2008, example 8.3.7](#tomDieck2008))

### Coset space structure

#### As quotients of compact Lie groups
 {#AsQuotientsOfCompactLieGroups}


+-- {: .num_prop #nSphereAsCosetSpace}
###### Proposition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the [[n-spheres]] are [[coset spaces]] of [[orthogonal groups]]

$$
  S^n \;\simeq\; O(n+1)/O(n)
  \,.
$$

Similarly for the corresponding [[special orthogonal groups]]

$$
  S^n \;\simeq\; SO(n+1)/SO(n)
$$

and [[spin groups]]

$$
  S^n \;\simeq\; Spin(n+1)/Spin(n)
$$

and [[pin groups]]

$$
  S^n \;\simeq\; Pin(n+1)/Pin(n)
  \,.
$$


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Fix a [[unit vector]] in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. Then its [[orbit]] under the defining $O(n+1)$-[[action]] on $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is clearly the canonical embedding $S^n \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. But precisely the subgroup of $O(n+1)$ that consists of rotations around the axis formed by that unit vector [[stabilizer group|stabilizes]] it, and that subgroup is isomorphic to $O(n)$, hence $S^n \simeq O(n+1)/O(n)$.

=--

Similarly, the analogous argument for [[unit spheres]] inside (the [[real vector spaces]] underlying) [[complex vector spaces]], we have

+-- {: .num_prop #OddDimSphereAsSpecialUnitaryCoset}
###### Proposition

For $k \in \mathbb{N}$ the [[n-sphere|(2k+1)-sphere]] $S^{2k+1}$ is the [[coset space]] of [[special unitary groups]]:

$$
  S^{2k+1}
  \;\simeq\;
  SU(k+1)/SU(k)
  \,.
$$

=--

And still similarly, the analogous argument for [[unit spheres]] inside (the [[real vector spaces]] underlying) [[quaternionic vector spaces]], we have

+-- {: .num_prop #SphereAsSymplecticUnitaryCoset}
###### Proposition

For $k \in \mathbb{N}$, $k \geq 1$ the [[n-sphere|(4k-1)-sphere]] $S^{4k-1}$ is the [[coset space]] of [[quaternionic unitary groups]]:

$$
  S^{4k-1}
  \;\simeq\;
  Sp(k)/Sp(k-1)
  \,.
$$

###### Proposition

The [[connected topological space|connected]] [[compact Lie groups]] with [[effective action|effective]] [[transitive actions]]  on [[n-spheres]] are precisely (up to [[isomorphism]]) the following:

* [[SO(n)]]

* [[U(n)]]

* [[SU(n)]]

* [[Sp(n)]]

* [[Sp(n).Sp(1)|Sp(n).SO(2)]]

* [[Sp(n).Sp(1)]]

* [[G₂]]

* [[Spin(7)]]

* [[Spin(9)]]

with [[coset spaces]]

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    SO(n)/SO(n-1)
    & \simeq S^{n-1}
    \\
    U(n)/U(n-1) & \simeq S^{2n-1}
    \\
    SU(n)/SU(n-1) & \simeq S^{2n-1}    
    \\
    Sp(n)/Sp(n-1) & \simeq S^{4n-1}

    \\
    G_2/SU(3) & \simeq S^6
    \\
    Spin(7)/G_2 & \simeq S^7

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

The [[isomorphisms]] in Prop. \ref{nSphereAsCosetSpace} and Prop. \ref{OddDimSphereAsSpecialUnitaryCoset} above hold in the [[category]] of [[topological spaces]] ([[homeomorphisms]]), but in fact also in the [[category]] of [[smooth manifolds]] ([[diffeomorphisms]]) and even in the [[category]] of [[Riemannian manifolds]] ([[isometries]]).

The other [[coset space]] realizations of some [[n-spheres]] in Prop. \ref{TransitiveEffectiveActionsOfConnectedLieGroupsOnSpheres} are [[homeomorphisms]], but not necessarily [[isometries]] ("[[squashed spheres]]"). There is also a [[double coset space]] realization which is not even a [[diffeomorphisms]] ("[[exotic sphere]]", the [[Gromoll-Meyer sphere]]).

#### As quotients of Lorentz groups
 {#AsQuotientsOfLorentzGroups}

If one drops the assumption of [[compact Lie group|compactness]], then there are further coset space realizations of $n$-spheres, notably as [[quotient group|quotients]] of [[Lorentz groups]] by [[parabolic subgroups]]: *[[celestial spheres]]*, e.g.: [Toller (2003, p. 18)](#Toller03), [Varlamov (2006, p. 6)](#Varlamov06), [Math.SE:a/4092474](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/4092474/58526).



### Spin structure

\begin{example}
The $n$-sphere, for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, carries a canonical [[spin structure]], induced from its [[coset space]]-realization $S^n \simeq Spin(n+1)/Spin(n)$ 
([above](#LabelCosetSpaceStructure)), as a special case of the canonical $H$-structure on $G/H$ ([this example](G-structure#CanonicalHStructureOnFModH)).
\end{example}

### Parallelizability

* Precisely four spheres are [[parallelizable]], and three of these are so via [[Lie group]] structure (hence are the only spheres with Lie group structure) (see at _[[Hopf invariant one theorem]]_):

  * $S^0$ (the [[group of order two]], the group of units of the [[real numbers]]);

  * $S^1$ (the [[circle group]], the group of unit [[complex numbers]]);

  * $S^3$ (the [[special unitary group]] $SU(2)$, the group of unit [[quaternions]]);

  * $S^7$ (the [[Moufang loop]] of unit [[octonions]])

### Branched covers

Every $n$-[[dimension|dimensional]] [[PL manifold]] admits a [[branched covering]] of the [[n-sphere]] ([Alexander 20](branched+cover#Alexander20)). 

By the [[Riemann existence theorem]], every [[connected topological space|connected]] [[compact topological space|compact]] [[Riemann surface]] admits the [[structure]] of a branched cover by a [[holomorphic function]] to the [[Riemann sphere]]. See [there](branched+cover+of+the+Riemann+sphere#RiemannSurfaces) at _[[branched cover of the Riemann sphere]]_.

For [[3-manifolds]] branched covering the [[3-sphere]] see ([Montesinos 74](branched+cover#Montesinos74)).


All [[PL manifold|PL]] [[4-manifolds]] are _simple_ branched covers of the  [[4-sphere]] ([Piergallini 95](#Piergallini95), [Iori-Piergallini 02](branched+cover#IoriPiergallini02)).

But the [[n-torus]] for $n \geq 3$ is _not a [[cyclic group|cyclic]]_ branched over of the [[n-sphere]] ([Hirsch-Neumann 75](branched+cover#HirschNeumann75))
