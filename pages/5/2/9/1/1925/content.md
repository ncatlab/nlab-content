## Idea
 {#Idea}

In [[algebra]], a _heap_ is an algebraic [[structure]] which is almost that of a [[group]] structure but without the specification of a [[neutral element]].  

While closely related to notions such as *[[affine space]]*, *[[principal homogeneous space]]* and *[[torsor]]*, the concept of heap is simpler in the sense that it postulates just a single set with a single [[ternary]] operation obeying two [[axioms]] (see Def. \ref{TheDefinition} below).

Concretely, any [[group]] gives a heap where this ternary operation is defined from the group's [[binary operation]] $(\text{-})\cdot(\text{-})$ and [[inverse element|inversion]] $(-)^{-1}$ by 

\[
  \label{HeapOperationInAGroup}
  t
  \,\colon\,
  (a,b,c) 
  \;\mapsto\; 
  a \cdot b^{-1} \cdot c
\]  

and every heap arises this way, up to [[isomorphism]] (cf. Prop. \ref{PrinIsEssentiallySurjective} below) from a group that may be called its *[[structure group]]*.  

However, the [[category]] of heaps (Def. \ref{CategoryOfHeaps} below) is not [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to the [[Grp|category of groups]]. Instead:

\begin{proposition}  
The [[category]] of heaps (Def. \ref{CategoryOfHeaps}) is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to the evident category of [[pairs]] consisting of a [[group]] $G$ and a $G$-torsor $H$. 
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
 On the one hand, for any heap $H$, choosing any element $h' \in H$, the [[endofunctions]] $t(h,h',-) \colon H \to H$ for $h \in H$ constitute a group $G$ under [[composition]], and the [[underlying]] set $H$ of the heap manifestly carries the [[structure]] of a $G$-torsor. On the other hand, given a group $G$ and a $G$-torsor $H$ we can make $H$ into a heap as follows: given elements $a,b,c \in H$ let $t(a,b,c) = g c$ where $g$ is the unique $g \in G$ with $g b = a$. 
\end{proof}

There is also a [[duality|dual]] version of the concept of heap, see at *[[quantum heap]]*.

\begin{remark}\label{Disambiguation}
**(disambiguation)**
\linebreak
Heaps in the sense of algebra should not be confused with either

* [heaps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap) in the sense of theoretical [[computer science]], 

nor with 

* *heaps of pieces* in the [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] sense of [Viennot 2006](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/BFb0072524).  

\end{remark}


\begin{remark}\label{Synonyms}
**(synonyms)**
\linebreak
There are also a number of synonyms for the term 'heap'; [below](#HeapsAndTorsors) we consider '[[torsor]]' in this light.  In Russian one term for a heap is 'груда' ('gruda') meaning a heap of soil; this is a pun as it is parallel to the Russian word 'группа' ('gruppa') meaning a group: forgetting the unit element is sort of creating an amorphous version.  This term also appears in English as 'groud'. In universal algebra the standard name is __associative Malcev algebra__ (in various spellings, including Mal'cev, Mal'tsev and Maltsev), other names include __herd__.
\end{remark}

There is an oidification ([[horizontal categorification]]) of heaps, sometimes called _heapoids_. 


## Definition

\begin{definition}
\label{TheDefinition}
A __heap__ $(H,t)$ is a [[inhabited set]] $H$ equipped with a ternary operation $t \colon H \times H \times H\to H$ satisfying the following two relations

1. $ t(b,b,c) = c = t(c,b,b)$,

1. $ t\big(a,b,t(c,d,e)\big) = t\big(t(a,b,c),d,e\big) $.

\end{definition}

More generally, a ternary operation in some [[variety of algebras]] satisfying the first pair of equations is called a [[Malcev operation]].  A Malcev operation is  called _associative_ if it also satisfies the latter equation (i.e. it makes its domain into a heap).

A heap is **abelian** if it additionally satisfies the relation
$$
  t(a,b,c) = t(c,b,a)
$$

\begin{definition}
\label{CategoryOfHeaps}
A *[[homomorphism]]* of heaps $f \colon H \to H'$ is, of course, a [[function]] of the [[underlying]] [[set]] which respects the ternary operations.  

This defines a [[category]] $Heap$ whose [[objects]] are heaps and whose [[morphisms]] are heap homomorphisms.
\end{definition}

The [[hom-sets]] of the [[full subcategory]] $AbHeap$ of abelian heaps inherit an abelian heap structure from the pointwise operation in the codomain: given $f,g,h\colon H \to G$, the function $a\mapsto t_G(f(a),g(a),h(a))$ is again a heap homomorphism. 

## Properties

### Structure groups of heaps
 {#StructureGroupsOfHeaps}

As indicated in (eq:HeapOperationInAGroup) a [[group]] $G$ becomes a heap by setting

\[
  a,b,c \,\in\, G
  \;\;\;\;\;\;
  \vdash
  \;\;\;\;\;\;
  t(a,b,c) \,\coloneqq\, a \cdot b^{-1} \cdot c
  \,.
\] 

\begin{proposition}
\label{PrinIsEssentiallySurjective}
This construction (eq:HeapOperationInAGroup) defines a [[functor]] 

$$
  Prin 
    \,\colon\, 
  Grp \longrightarrow Heap
$$  

from the category [[Grp]] of [[groups]] to that of heaps,
which is [[essentially surjective functor|essentially surjective]], meaning that, up to [[isomorphism]] all heaps arise in this way.

In fact, there is also a functor
$$
  Str 
   \,\colon\,
  Heap \longrightarrow Grp
$$

such that

1. there exist [[natural isomorphisms|natural]] group isomorphisms of the form

   $Str\big(Prin(G)\big) \,\cong\, G$ 


1. there exist heap isomorphisms of the form 

   $Prin\big(Str(H)\big) \,\cong\, H$  
  
   which however are *not* [[natural transformation|natural]] (whence we do *not* have an [[equivalence of categories]]).

\end{proposition}
This group $Str(H)$ is called the *structure group* of the heap $H$.
\begin{proof}
Given a heap $H$, the claimed [[structure group]]  $Str(H)$ is described, up to [[isomorphism]], by any of the following constructions:

1. Choosing any [[element]] $\mathrm{e} \in H$, then the [[binary operation]]

   \[
     \label{BinaryOperationInFirstModel}
     a \cdot b \,\coloneqq\, t(a, \mathrm{e} ,b)
     \,.
   \]

   constitutes a [[group]] [[structure]] on $H$, with [[neutral element]] $\mathrm{e}$. 

   This serves as the required structure group: $Str(H) \,\coloneqq\, (H, \cdot)$.


2. Take the [[underlying set]] of $Str(H)$ to be that of [[equivalence classes]] of [[pairs]] $(a,b) \in H\times H$, subject to the [[equivalence relation]] 

   $$
     (a,b) \,\sim\, (a',b')
     \;\;\;\;\text{iff}\;\;\;\;
     t(a,b,b') \,=\, a'
   $$  

   (the idea is to think of the pair $(a,b)$ as the representative of $a b^{-1}$)

   and take the [[binary operation]] on the group to be given on representatives by

   \[
     \label{BinaryOperationInSecondModel}
     (c,d) \cdot (a,b) 
     \,\coloneqq\, 
     \big( c, t(d,a,b) \big)
     \,.
   \] 

   This again defines a group $Str(H)$. 

   Notice that: 

   * the [[inverse element|inverse]] of (the [[equivalence class]] of) $(a,b)$ is (the equivalence class of) $(b,a)$ 

   * the [[neutral element]] is (the equivalence class of) $(a,a)$ (for any $a$).

3. Finally, $Str(H)$ is realized also as an actual [[subgroup]] of the [[symmetric group]] on the [[underlying set]] of  $H$, analogously to [[Cayley's theorem]] for groups.  We take the elements of $Str(H)$ to be set [[bijections]] of the form 

   \[
      \label{GroupActionInThirdModel}
      t(a,b,-) \,\colon\, H \rightarrow H
      \,,
   \]

    where $a,b \in H$, with [[composition]] as the group's [[binary operation]].  

   Notice here that 

   \[ 
      t(c,d,-) \cdot_{Str(H)} t(a,b,-) 
      \;=\;
      t\big(c,d,t(a,b,-)\big) \;=\; t\big(t(c,d,a),b,-\big)
      \,, 
   \]

   so that $Str(H)$ is closed under this operation.  

   The first axiom of a  heap shows that $Str(H)$ contains the [[neutral element]] $t(-,x,x)$, for any  $x$), and the [[inverse element]] of $t(\cdot,a,b)$ is $t(\cdot,b,a)$; thus  $Str(H)$ is a subgroup of the symmetric group of $H$.

It remains to see that these constructions all agree and are functorial.

First to show that the [[equivalence relation]] used in the second construction is symmetric, and that it coincides with that implicitly used in the first construction, notice that 
the following are equivalent:

* (i) the bijections $t(a,b,-)$ and $t(a',b',-)$ coincide

* (ii) $t(a,b,b') = a'$

* (iii) $t(a',b',b) = a$

Namely:

(ii) follows from (i) and $t(a,a,b) = b$.

(ii) implies (iii) as follows.  Given $t(a,b,b') = a'$, we have
$t(t(a,b,b'),b',b) = t(a',b',b)$, but 

$$ t(t(a,b,b'),b',b) = t(a,b,t(b',b',b)) = t(a,b,b) = a$$

so $t(a',b',b) = a$.   (iii) implies (ii) by a similar argument.

(i) follows from (ii) by the calculation:
\[ t(a',b',x) = t(a',b',t(b,b,x))= t(t(a',b',b),b,x)
t(a,b,x)\]

Since the composition laws can also be seen to agree, the second two constructions of $Str(H)$ are canonically isomorphic.  

To compare them to the first construction, observe that for a fixed $\mathrm{e} \in H$, any equivalence class contains a unique pair of the form $(\mathrm{e},a)$.  (If $(b,c)$ is in the equivalence class, then $a$ is determined by $a = t(\mathrm{e},b,c)$.)  This sets up a bijection between the first two constructions, which we can easily show is an isomorphism.

Finally, the second construction is manifestly functorial.
\end{proof}

The following proposition expands on the fact that a group is the same as a [[pointed]] heap, i.e. a heap with a chosen element:

\begin{proposition}
The category of groups is equivalent to the [[slice category]]
$1 \downarrow \mathrm{Heap}$ where $1$ is the terminal heap and $\mathrm{Heap}$ is the category of heaps (Def. \ref{CategoryOfHeaps}).
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
The one-element set $1$ is a heap in a unique way, and for any heap $H$, any function $f: 1 \to H$ or $f: H \to 1$ is a heap homomorphism, so $1$ is the terminal object in $\mathrm{Heap}$ and $1 \downarrow \mathrm{Heap}$ is the category of pointed heaps.  As noted in the proof of the previous proposition, a heap $H$ with a chosen point $\mathrm{e}$ becomes a group with multiplication $a \cdot b \,\coloneqq\, t(a, \mathrm{e} ,b)$, and a morphism of pointed heaps then becomes a group homomorphism.  This gives a functor $1 \downarrow \mathrm{Heap} \to \mathrm{Grp}$, which is an equivalence thanks to the functor $\mathrm{Grp} \to 1 \downarrow \mathrm{Heap}$ sending any group to the corresponding pointed heap.
\end{proof}

### Relation to torsors
 {#HeapsAndTorsors}

Given a group $G$, a $G$-[[torsor]] is a nonempty set $X$ with a free and transitive action of $G$, which we may write as

$$ \begin{array}{ccl}
G \times X &\to& X \\
(g, x) &\mapsto& g x 
\end{array}
$$

Equivalently, a $G$-torsor is a set $X$ with an [[group action|action]] of the group $G$ but also a "division" operation

$$ \begin{array}{ccl}
X \times X &\to& G \\
(x, y) &\mapsto& x/y
\end{array}
$$

obeying

$$ (x/y) y = x $$

Given a group $G$ together with a $G$-torsor $X$, we can make $X$ into a heap by giving it the ternary operation

$$ \begin{array}{ccl}
X \times X \times X &\to& X \\
(x, y, z) &\mapsto& (x/y) z
\end{array}
$$

Conversely, from any heap $H$ we can construct a group $G$ together with a $G$-torsor whose underlying set is $H$ itself.
To see this, note that the group $G = Str(H)$ (eq:PrinIsEssentiallySurjective) comes equipped with a canonical [[group action]] on $H$, as is most clear from the third definition (eq:GroupActionInThirdModel).  

This action is 

* [[transitive action|transitive]] 

  by $t(a,a,b) = b$

and

* [[free action|free]]

  since if $t(a,b,c) = a$ then by the previous statement $t(x,b,c) = x$ for each $x$, and in particular $t(b,b,c) = b$ and also $t(b,b,c) = c$.  

Therefore, $H$ is an $Str(H)$-[[torsor]] (over a point).  

Conversely, any [[torsor]] $H$ over a group $G$ becomes a heap, by defining 

$$
  t(a,b,c) \,\coloneqq\, g \cdot c
  \,,
$$

where $g\in G$ is the unique group element such that $g\cdot b = a$.

In fact, the category $Heap$ is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to the following category $Tors$: its objects are pairs $(G,H)$ consisting of a group $G$ and a $G$-torsor $H$, and its morphisms are pairs $(\phi,f):(G,H)\to (G',H')$ consisting of a group homomorphism $\phi:G\to G'$ and a $\phi$-equivariant map $f:H\to H'$. 

### Groups as pointed heaps 

As indicated in the discussion above, a heap $H$ acquires a group structure $(a, b) \mapsto t(a, e, b)$ as soon as an element $e \in H$ is selected (and this $e$ is then the identity element of the group). Notice that every function $1 \to H$ from a terminal set $1$ is in fact a heap homomorphism when we consider that $1$ carries a unique heap structure. In different words: the free heap on a terminal set $1$ is $1$ itself with its unique heap structure. 

It follows that the category of groups [[Grp]] is equivalent to the [[comma category]] $1 \downarrow Heap$, with both categories considered as categories over $Heap$ (via $Prin: Grp \to Heap$ and the forgetful functor $U: 1 \downarrow Heap \to Heap$ that forgets the point). This says that groups are equivalent to pointed heaps. 

Both of these forgetful functors are [[monadic functor|monadic]] over $Heap$. In the case of $U: 1 \downarrow Heap \to Heap$, the [[monad]] is $1 \sqcup -$, where the monad structure is induced from the [[monoid]] structure that $1$ carries with respect to the [[cocartesian monoidal category|cocartesian monoidal product]] $\sqcup$. The free pointed heap on $H$ is therefore the heap $1 \sqcup H$, equipped with the pointing given by the coproduct coprojection $1 \to 1 \sqcup H$. 

It follows that the free group on a heap $H$ can be constructed abstractly as $1 \sqcup H$. This is analogous to how the free [[vector space]] on an [[affine space]] $A$ can be described as $1 \sqcup A$, although it is true that [[coproducts]] of affine spaces are vastly easier to describe concretely than coproducts of heaps. 

Here is a more group-theoretic description of the free group on $H$. Let $Str(H)$ be the structure group, given as the group of heap automorphisms of the form $t(a, b, -): H \to H$. Let 

$$\alpha: Str(H) \times H \to H$$ 

denote the tautological action. Let $F(H)$ denote the free group on the underlying set of $H$. For groups $G, G'$, let $G \ast G'$ denote their free product (coproduct). Then the free group on the heap $H$ is the [[quotient group|quotient]] of $Str(H) \ast F(H)$ given by the coequalizer of two maps 

$$\beta, \gamma: F(Str(H) \times H) \rightrightarrows Str(H) \ast F(H)$$ 

where $\beta$ is the composition of $F(\alpha): F(Str(H) \times H) \to F(H)$ followed by the coproduct coprojection $F(H) \to Str(H) \ast F(H)$, and $\gamma$ is the unique group homomorphism that extends the function 

$$Str(H) \times H \to Str(H) \ast H$$ 

mapping a pair $(\theta, h)$ to their product $\theta \cdot h$ in the group $Str(H) \ast H$. 

The meaning of the construction is that group homomorphisms $Str(H) \ast F(H) \to G$ that factor through the coequalizer are in natural bijection with pairs 

$$(\phi: Str(H) \to G, f: H \to G)$$ 

where $\phi$ is a homomorphism and $f$ is a function, satisfying the torsor homomorphism condition 

$$f(\theta(h)) = \phi(\theta) \cdot f(h)$$ 

which is an equivalent way of describing a heap homomorphism $H \to Prin(G)$. 


## The empty heap {#empty}

If we wish $Heap$ to be an [[algebraic category]], then we must remove the clause that the underlying set of a heap must be nonempty (see also at *[[pseudo-torsor]]*).  Then the [[empty set]] becomes a heap in a unique way. 

However, in this case, some of the above theorems relating heaps to groups break down.  It is of course still true that $Grp \simeq (1\downarrow Heap)$, since any pointed heap must be inhabited; but the empty heap does not have a structure group.  For this reason, one usually requires a heap to be inhabited.

On the other hand, we could generalize the notion of [[group]] to allow for an empty group.  This even remains a purely algebraic notion: we can define a group as an [[inhabited]] [[invertible semigroup]] $(S,\cdot,(-)^{-1})$ or an inhabited [[associative quasigroup]]. Then any [[invertible semigroup]] or [[associative quasigroup]] is a possibly-empty-heap, and every possibly-empty-heap arises in this way from its automorphism invertible semigroup or automorphism associative quasigroup (defined by either method (2) or (3)); the category of possibly-empty-heaps is equivalent to the category of invertible semigroups equipped with torsors over the point, and the category of associative quasigroups equipped with torsors over the point; etc.

This is even [[constructive mathematics|constructive]]; the theorems can be proved uniformly, rather than by treating the empty and inhabited cases separately. (This rather trivial method is obvious to a classical mathematician, but it\'s not constructively valid, since a invertible semigroup/associative quasigroup/heap as defined here can\'t be constructively proved empty or inhabited; it can only be proved empty iff not inhabited.  Indeed, taking any group $G$ and any [[truth value]] $P$, the invertible subsemigroup or associative subquasigroup $\{x \in G \;|\; P\}$ is empty or inhabited iff $P$ is false or true.)

## Examples in homotopy theory

The map $[0,1]\to[0,1]$ that sends $0\mapsto 0$, $1/3\mapsto 1$, $2/3\mapsto 0$, $1\mapsto 1$,
and interpolates linearly between these points
yields an associative Malcev operation on $[\Sigma X,Y]$,
where $X$ and $Y$ are (unpointed) spaces, $\Sigma$ is the [[suspension]] functor, and $[-,-]$ denotes the set of morphisms in the [[homotopy category]].

Thus, $[\Sigma X,Y]$ is a (nonabelian) heap.
Likewise, the full mapping space $Map(\Sigma X,Y)$ can be turned into an (∞,1)-heap, defined as an (∞,1)-algebra (in spaces) over the algebraic theory of heaps.
