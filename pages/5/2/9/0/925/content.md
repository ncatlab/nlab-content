#Range of versions and applications#

Maurer-Cartan equation is a name for very many related equations in geometry, algebra, deformation theory, category theory and quantization theory. Such equations express for example certain conditions in theory of isometric embedding of submanifolds into a euclidean space ('structure equations', with relation to Lie group $O(n)$), invariance of invariant differential forms ([[Maurer-Cartan forms|Maurer-Cartan form]]) on Lie groups, flatness of connections on principal or associated fibre bundles, the solutions in some contexts parametrize infinitesimal deformations, or define [[twisting cochain|twisting cochain]].
In the context of BV-quantization, Maurer-Cartan equation has the role of classical master equation. 

Maurer-Cartan equation for $A_\infty$-algebras is usually referred to as generalized Maurer-Cartan equation as it has more summands than the one for dg-algebras. In some contexts like $A_\infty$-categories, some authors prefer geometric terminology 'homological vector field' as a datum on a formal geometric space which satisfies a Maurer-Cartan equation.

#Maurer-Cartan and Lie theory#

Sophus Lie considered groups of transformations first and discovered Lie algebras only later (around 1874). He has shown that infinitesimally one can solve the Maurer-Cartan equations for a given set of structure constants of a finite-dimensional Lie algebra. This means that one can construct a neighborhood with either the invariant differential form, or dually the invariant vector fields whose commutator correspond to the commutator of the Lie algebra. This amounts to integrating Lie algebra to a local Lie group. Only much later, Elie Cartan succeeded to prove the global version of integration, that is the Cartan-Lie theorem. J-P. Serre in an influential textbook called the Cartan-Lie theorem the "third Lie theorem" what became rather popular term in recent years, though one should correctly call so just the theorem on local solvability of Maurer-Cartan equation.
