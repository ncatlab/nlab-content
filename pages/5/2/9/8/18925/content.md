## Overview
Surreal geometry is in simplest terms the study of three central ideas: the study of [[algebraic geometry]] over (the space of) [[surreal numbers]], generalizations for notions of geometry as well as properties one can derive from them, and last but not least the philosophical scope and meaning of geometry. In an essence, surreal geometry studies geometry itself and the blending of the three aforementioned areas of studies. The prime foundation of surreal geometry is the study of the topology and geometry of surreal numbers.
