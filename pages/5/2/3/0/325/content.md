#The idea

Given a category $C$, we obtain the 'opposite category' $C^{op}$ by turning all the arrows around.  This idea is important in understanding [[duality]].  For example, a [[comonoid]] in $C$ is the same as a [[monoid]] in $C^{op}$.

# Definition

Given a category $C$, the **opposite category** $C^{op}$ has the same objects as $C$, but a morphism $f : x \to y$ in $C^{op}$ is the same as a morphism $f : y \to x$ in $C$, and a composite of morphisms $g f$ in $C^{op}$ is defined to be the composite $f g$ in $C$.
