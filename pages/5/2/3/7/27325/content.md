## Idea

Proposed by [[Peter Scholze]] in the *Analytic Stacks* lectures in 2023 ([Clausen-Scholze 2023](#ClausenScholze23)) as a more well-behaved replacement for [[condensed sets]] and [[pyknotic sets]] in [[condensed mathematics]] that eliminate the size issues in the other two approaches. More specifically, 

* unlike [[condensed sets]], light condensed sets form a [[Grothendieck topos]], rather than merely a [[pretopos]]

* unlike [[pyknotic sets]], light condensed sets do not require [[universes]]

## Definition

Recall that a [[light profinite set]] is a [[countable set|countable]] [[limit]] of [[finite sets]]. A **light condensed set** is a [[sheaf]] on the [[site]] of [[light profinite sets]] with finite jointly surjective families of maps as covers. 

## Category of light condensed sets

The category of light condensed sets $\mathrm{LightCondSet}$ is a [[Grothendieck topos]]. 

There is a functor that reflects the category of light condensed sets back onto the category of [[sequential topological spaces]]
