#Definition#

An **algebra over an [[operad]]** is the single [[hom-object]] of a [[category over an operad]] which has a single [[object]].

##Remarks##

* If $C$ is the [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal]] [[enriched category|enriching category]], $O$ the $C$-enriched operad in question, and $A \in Obj(C)$ is the single [[hom-object]] of the [[category over an operad|O-category]] with single object, it makes sense to write $\mathbf{B}A$ for that $O$-category. Compare the discussion at [[monoid]] and [[group]], which are special cases of this.
