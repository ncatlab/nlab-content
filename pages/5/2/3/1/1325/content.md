## Definition 

An **algebra over an [[operad]]** is a [[category over an operad]] which has a single [[object]].

**Remark** If $C$ is the [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal]] [[enriched category|enriching category]], $O$ the $C$-enriched operad in question, and $A \in Obj(C)$ is the single [[hom-object]] of the [[category over an operad|O-category]] with single object, it makes sense to write $\mathbf{B}A$ for that $O$-category. Compare the discussion at [[monoid]] and [[group]], which are special cases of this.


## Examples

* an [[associative algebra]] is an algebra over the [[associative operad]].

  * an [[A-infinity-algebra]] is an algebra over a cofibrant resolution of $Assoc$.

* a [[commutative algebra]] is an algebra over the [[commutative operad]].

  * an [[E-infinity-algebra]] is an algebra over a cofibrant resolution of the commutative operad

* etc.
