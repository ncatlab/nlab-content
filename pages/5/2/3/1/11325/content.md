## Idea

_Cosmic censorship_ is the name of a pair of [[conjectures]] due to [[Roger Penrose]] in the [[theory (physics)|theory]] of [[general relativity]] saying that under physically reasonable conditions any [[singularities]] in [[spacetime]] must lie behind an [[event horizon]].    

Both conjectures concern solutions of Einstein's equations with physically realistic matter and generic compact or asymptotically flat initial data.
The **strong cosmic censorship conjecture**, proposed by Penrose in 1986, states that the maximal Cauchy development of such a solution is locally inextendible as a regular Lorentzian manifold.   The **weak cosmic censorship hypothesis**, proposed by him in 1988, asserts that for generic initial data, the maximal Cauchy development of a solution of Einstein's equations with realistic matter possesses a complete future null infinity.   Despite their names, the strong version does not necessarily imply the weak version.

Without the 'genericity' condition, which needs to be carefully stated, both strong and weak cosmic censorship fail.  That is, with carefully fine-tuned initial data one can find counterexamples.   

The weak cosmic censorship conjecture has many counterexamples in [[dimension]] $d \geq 5$.  [[Cumrun Vafa]] has argued that the _[[weak gravity conjecture]]_ will save the cosmic censorship conjecture. The weak gravity conjecture says that in consistent theories of [[quantum gravity]] the gravitational force exerted by any object (e.g. a [[black hole]]) has to be weaker, in suitable units, than any other force. As discussed in ([Crisford-Santos 17](#CrisfordSantos17)) it seems plausible that this constraint would indeed rule out the counterexample constructed there:

> Subsequent calculations by Santos and Crisford supported Vafa's hunch; the simulations they're running now could verify that naked singularities become cloaked in black holes right at the point where gravity becomes the weakest force. ([Wolchover, June 20 2017](https://www.quantamagazine.org/where-gravity-is-weak-and-naked-singularities-are-verboten-20170620/))

The [[weak gravity conjecture]] was motivated from [[string theory]], where there are various plausibility arguments that it holds.
