## Idea

The _cosmic censorship hypothesis_ is the name of a pair of [[conjectures]] ([Penrose 69](#Penrose69)) saying that in the [[theory (physics)|theory]] of [[general relativity]], under physically reasonable conditions, any [[singularities]] in [[spacetime]] must lie behind an [[event horizon]].    

Both the weak and the string form of the conjecture concern solutions of [[Einstein's equations]] with physically realistic matter and generic compact or asymptotically flat initial data.

The **strong cosmic censorship conjecture**, proposed by Penrose in 1986, states that the maximal Cauchy development of such a solution is locally inextendible as a regular Lorentzian manifold.  

The **weak cosmic censorship hypothesis**, proposed by him in 1988, asserts that for generic initial data, the maximal [[Cauchy surface|Cauchy development]] of a solution of Einstein's equations with realistic matter possesses a complete future null infinity.   

Despite their names, the strong version does not necessarily imply the weak version.

Without the 'genericity' condition, which needs to be carefully stated, both strong and weak cosmic censorship fail.  That is, with carefully fine-tuned [[initial value problem|initial data]] one can find counterexamples.   

## Properties

### Relation to the weak gravity conjecture

The weak cosmic censorship conjecture has many counterexamples in [[dimension]] $d \geq 5$.  [[Cumrun Vafa]] has argued that the _[[weak gravity conjecture]]_ will save the cosmic censorship conjecture. The weak gravity conjecture says that in consistent theories of [[quantum gravity]] the gravitational force exerted by any object (e.g. a [[black hole]]) has to be weaker, in suitable units, than any other force. As discussed in ([Crisford-Santos 17](#CrisfordSantos17)) it seems plausible that this constraint would indeed rule out the counterexample constructed there:

> Subsequent calculations by Santos and Crisford supported Vafa's hunch; the simulations they're running now could verify that naked singularities become cloaked in black holes right at the point where gravity becomes the weakest force. ([Wolchover, June 20 2017](https://www.quantamagazine.org/where-gravity-is-weak-and-naked-singularities-are-verboten-20170620/))

The [[weak gravity conjecture]] was motivated from [[string theory]], where there are various plausibility arguments that it holds.

In 1993 Choptuik found a counterexample to weak cosmic censorship without the requirement that the initial data be generic, by considering a spherically symmetric solution of gravity coupled to a scalar field right on the brink of the formation of a black hole.   This and subsequent work is reviewed here:
