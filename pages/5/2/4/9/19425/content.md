## Idea

One of the conjectured [[dualities in string theory]]:

[[M-theory]] in a configuration whose low-energy [[super spacetime]] is an [[orbifold]] locally of the form $\mathbb{R}^{5,1} \times (\mathbb{R}^5\sslash_{refl} \mathbb{Z}_2)$ is argued to be equivalent to [[KK-compactifications]] of [[type IIB string theory]] on [[K3-surfaces]].

(Either this refers to the [[perturbation series]]-limit of M-theory, or else, more generally, to [[non-perturbative effect|non-perturbative]] type IIB theory, now also known as [[F-theory]].)

This was originally argued in ([Dasgupta-Mukhil 96, section 2](#DasguptaMukhil96)) and ([Witten 95b](#Witten95b), [Sen 96, top. of p .5](#Sen96)).

## Properties

### Geometric engineering of the 6d $(2,0)$-superconformal QFT
  {#GeometricEngineeringOfThe6d2SuperconformalQFT}

On either side of the [[duality in string theory|duality]], this is the setup that exhibits [[geometric engineering of quantum field theory|geometric engineering]] of the [[6d (2,0)-superconformal QFT]] in the [[ADE-classification]]:

On the type IIB-side this is argued in ([Witten95a, section 1](#Witten95a)), for [[ADE singularities]] in the [[K3-surface]].

On the M-theory side, ([Witten 95b, p. 9-10](#Witten95b)) identifies the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-[[orbifold]] singularity with the worldvolume of [[M5-branes]]. Placing this furthermore inside the [[ADE singularity]] locus of a [[MK6-brane]] should be the corresponding setup (any reference saying this explicitly, i.e. speaking about M5 $\cap$ (MK6 at ADE) ?)
