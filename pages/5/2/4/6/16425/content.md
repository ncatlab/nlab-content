## Idea

An [[alternating group]] $A_n$ is a [[subgroup]] of a [[symmetric group]] $S_n$ consisting of the _even_ [[permutations]].

The alternating group $A_n$ is to the [[symmetric group]] $S_n$ as the [[special orthogonal group]] $SO(n)$ is to the [[orthogonal group]] $O(n)$. See also at _[symmetric group -- Whitehead tower](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/permutation#WhietheadTowerAndSupersymmetry)_

## Examples

* The alternating group $A_4$ on four elements is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the orientation-preserving [[tetrahedral group]].

* The alternating group $A_5$ on five elements, of order $60$, is the smallest nonabelian [[simple group]]. Geometrically, it may be realized as a subgroup of $SO(3)$ which carries a regular [[icosahedron]] into itself. 

* For all $n \geq 5$, the alternating group $A_n$ is simple. This is true even if $n$ is infinite: define $Alt(X)$ for any set $X$ to consist of all permutations of $X$ each of which fixes all but finitely elements, and which is an even permutation on that finite subset.
