#Morava K-theory

## Definition

For each [[prime number|prime integer]] $p$ there exists a sequence of [[multiplicative cohomology theory|multiplicative]] [[generalized cohomology theories|generalized cohomology]]/[[generalized homology theories|homology theories]], hence of [[E-infinity ring]] [[spectra]] 

$$
  \{K(n)\}_{i \in \mathbb{N}}
$$ 

with the following properties:

1. $K(0)_\ast(X)=H_\ast(X;\mathbb{Q})$ and $\overline{K(0)}_\ast(X)=0$ when $\overline{H}_\ast(X)$ is all [[torsion]].

1. $K(1)_\ast(X)$ is one of $p-1$ isomorphic summands of mod-$p$ complex [[topological K-theory]]. 

1. $K(0)_\ast(pt.)=\mathbb{Q}$ and for $n\neq 0$, $K(n)_\ast(pt.)=\mathbb{Z}/(p)[v_n,v_n^{-1}]$ where $\vert v_n\vert=2p^n-2$.  This [[ring]] is a graded [[field]] in the sense that every graded [[module]] over it is [[free module|free]].  $K(n)_\ast(X)$ is a module over $K(n)_\ast(pt.)$.

1. There is a [[Künneth isomorphism]]: $K(n)_\ast(X\times Y)\cong K(n)_\ast(X)\otimes_{K(n)_\ast(pt.)}K(n)_\ast(Y).$

1. Let $X$ be a p-local finite [[CW-complex]]. If $\overline{K(n)}_\ast(X)$ vanishes then so does $\overline{K(n-1)}_\ast(X)$.

1. If $X$ as above is not contractible then $\overline{K(n)}_\ast(X)=K(n)_\ast(pt.)\otimes \overline{H}_\ast(X;\mathbb{Z}/(p))$.

These are called the _Morava K-theories_.

Due to the third point one may regard $K(n)$ as a [[E-∞ field]] among the [[E-infinity rings]]. See [below](#AsInfinityFields).

## Properties

### Universal characterization

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

For each [[prime number]] $p$ and each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the Morava K-theory [[E-∞ ring]] $K(n)$ is, up to [[equivalence in an (∞,1)-category]], the unique [[E-∞ ring]] which is

1. [[complex oriented cohomology theory|complex oriented]];

1. whose [[formal group]] has [[height of a formal group|height]] exactly $n$;

1. whose [[homotopy groups]] are $\pi_\bullet \simeq \mathbb{F}_p[v_n^\pm]$. (with $v_n$ defined as at _[[height of a formal group|height]]_).

For instance ([Lurie, lecture 24, prop. 11](#LurieLecture)).

### As $E_\infty$-fields
 {#AsInfinityFields}

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

If $E$ is an [[E-∞ field]] then $E \otimes K(n) \neq 0$ and $E$ admits the structure of a $K(n)$-[[module spectrum|module]].

=--

This appears for instance as ([Lurie, lecture 24, prop. 9, remark 13](#LurieLecture))

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

This means that the Morava $E_\infty$-rings $K(n)$ are essentially the only [[E-∞ fields]] in the [[stable homotopy category]].

See ([Lurie, lecture 24, remark 13](#LurieLecture))



### Relation to chromatic homotopy theory

The layers in the [[chromatic homotopy theory|chromatic tower]] capture periodic phenomena in [[stable homotopy theory]], corresponding to the Morava K-theory $E_\infty$-fields.

(...)

### Relation to Bousfield lattice

It is known that in the [[Bousfield lattice]] of the [[stable homotopy category]], the Bousfield classes of the Morava K-theories are minimal. It is conjectured by [[Mark Hovey]] and John Palmieri that the [[Boolean algebra]] contained in the Bousfield lattice is atomic and generated by the Morava K-theories and the spectra $A(n)$ which measure the failure of the [[telescope conjecture]].

### Orientation

[[orientation in generalized cohomology]] of [[integral Morava K-theory]] is discussed in ([Sati-Kriz 04](#SatiKriz04))

### $\infty$-Group rings and twists

Write $gl_1(K(n))$ for the [[∞-group of units]] of the (a) Morava K-theory spectrum

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

For $p = 2$ and all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, there is an [[equivalence in an (infinity,1)-category|equivalence]]

$$
  Maps(B^{n+1}U(1), B gl_1(K(n)))
  \simeq
  \mathbb{Z}/(2)
$$

between the [[mapping space]] from the [[classifying space]] for [[circle n-bundle|circle (n+1)-bundles]] to the [[delooping]] of the [[∞-group of units]] of $K(n)$.

([Sati-Westerland 11, theorem 1](#SatiWesterland11))

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

By the discussion at [[(∞,1)-vector bundle]] this means that for each such map there is a type of [[twisted cohomology|twist]] of Morava K-theory (at $p = 2$).
