A  _closed monoidal category module_ $C$ is a [[monoidal category module]] over a [[closed monoidal category|closed]] [[monoidal category|symmetric monoidal]] [[category]] $V$ such that the (left) action

$$
  \otimes : V \times C \to C
$$

extends to a [[two-variable adjunction]].  Such closed modules can be identified with $V$-[[enriched category|enriched categories]] having [[power]]s and [[copower]]s.
