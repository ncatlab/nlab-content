#Definition#

"Horizontal categorification" describes the process by which 

 1. a concept is realized to be equivalent to a certain type of category with a _single object_;

 2. and then this concept is generalized -- or [[oidification|oidified]] -- by passing to instances of such types of categories with more than one object.

So why don't we just call this "oidification" and save "categorification" for the vertical concept?

#Remarks#

This is to be contrasted with [[vertical categorification]].

#Examples#

* The horizontal categorification of groups are [[groupoids]]: categories in which every morphisms is invertible.

* The horizontal categorification of algebras are _algebroids_: categories [[Internalization|internal to]] the category of vector spaces.

* The horizontal categorification of rings are [[ringoids]]: categories [[internalization|internal to]] the category of abelian groups. ([blog](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2006/09/ringoids.html))

* The horizontal categorification of $C^*$-algebras hence ought to be known as _$C^*$--algebroids_  but is usually known as [[Cstar-categories|C*-categories]].

* Since, by the Gelfand theorem, $C^*$-algebras are dual to topological spaces, Paolo Bertozzini et. al proposed to define [[spaceoids]] to be entities dual to $C^*$-categories ([blog](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/01/spaceoids.html)).

* And finally the **exception from the rule**: a many-object [[monoid]] is _not_ called a _monoidoid_ -- but is called a [[category]]! :-)
