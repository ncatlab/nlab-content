  **Non-Relativistic M2-Branes and AdS/CFT**

  cf.: [arXiv:1904.07547](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07547)

  > We discuss a peculiar limit of [[M2-branes]] that leads to a non-relativistic [[ABJM model|Chern-Simons-matter theory]] with an infinite dimensional spacetime [[symmetry group]] and whose dynamics leads to [[quantum mechanics]] on a [[Hitchin moduli space]]. We also discuss the corresponding limit in the [[AdS-CFT correspondence|gravitational dual]] which is described by an eleven-dimensional Membrane-Newton-Cartan theory about a [[background field|background]] with an [[anti de Sitter spacetime|$AdS_2$]] factor.

  **The Differential Geometry and Topology of Four-
Dimensional Universal Supergravity**

  cf.: [arXiv:2101.07236](pre-metric+electromagnetism#LazaroiuShahbazi23)

  > Using the [[sheaf cohomology|cohomology]] of the appropriate [[locally constant sheaf]] I will explain how to implement the [[Dirac charge quantization|Dirac-Schwinger-Zwanziger integrality condition]] on [[D=4 supergravity|four-dimensional]] [[classical field theory|classical]] ungauged [[supergravity]] and how to interpret it geometrically in order to obtain its [[U-duality|duality]]-covariant, [[gauge theory|gauge-theoretic]], [[differential geometry|differential-geometric]] global model. Using this construction, I will prove that [[D=4 supergravity|four-dimensional]] bosonic un[[gauged supergravity|gauged]] [[supergravity]] is completely determined by a choice of polarized Siegel bundle defined over the total space of a vertically [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian]] [[submersion]] equipped with a complete [[Ehresmann connection]], showing that its gauge sector reduces to a polarized [[self-dual higher gauge theory|self-duality condition]] for connections on the underlying polarized Siegel bundle. Furthermore, I will explore the continuous and arithmetic [[U-duality]] groups of the theory, characterizing them through [[short exact sequences]] and realizing the latter through the [[automorphism group]] of the underlying Siegel bundle acting on its [[adjoint bundle]]. This elucidates the geometric origin of [[U-duality]] and justifies the miraculous existence of U-dualities by describing them as a [[gauge transformation]] of the appropriately defined [[principal bundle]].

  **Gauge Theory for String Algebroids**

  cf.: [arXiv:arXiv:2004.11399](string+algebroid#GarciaFernandezRubioTipler)  

  > In this talk I will explain a [[moment map]] construction for [[string algebroids]], a special type of [[Courant algebroids]] which arise as [[Atiyah algebroids]] of [[principal 2-bundle|higher principal bundles]]. The zero locus of our moment map is given by the solutions of the Calabi system, a coupled system of equations which provides a unifying framework for the classical Calabi problem and the Hull-Strominger system in [[heterotic string theory]]. Our main results are concerned with the geometry of the [[moduli space]] of solutions, and assume a technical condition which is fulfilled in examples. We prove that the [[moduli space]] carries a pseudo-Kähler metric with Kähler potential given by the [[dilaton]] functional, a topological formula for the metric, and an infinitesimal Donaldson-Uhlenbeck-Yau type theorem. Based on joint work with Rubio and Tipler in [arXiv:arXiv:2004.11399](string+algebroid#GarciaFernandezRubioTipler) (to appear in JDG) and ongoing joint work with Álvarez-Cónsul and Tellez.

  **Towards Non-Perturbative Lagrangian Field Theory via
the Topos of Smooth Sets**

  cf.: [arXiv:2312.16301](smooth+set#GiotopoulosSati23)

  > Any notion of [[non-perturbative field theory|non-pertubative]] ([[prequantum geometry|pre]])-[[quantization]] of [[classical field theories]], as in particular expected in [[M-theory|M-theoretic]] contexts, presupposes a [[convenient category of topological spaces|convenient category]] within which non-pertubative classical field theory may be rigorously formalised. In this talk, I will describe [[smooth sets]] as a [[category]] of [[generalized smooth spaces]], completely determined by "how they may be smoothly probed by finite dimensional [[smooth manifold|manifolds]]". Formally, this is the "[[topos]] [[category of sheaves|of sheaves]] over the [[site]] of [[Cartesian spaces]]". I will then explain how the [[variational calculus|variational algorithm]] of ([[bosonic field|bosonic]]) [[classical field theory]] and the space of [[on-shell]] [[field (physics)|fields]] naturally take place in [[smooth sets]], along with many more field theoretic concepts. Time permitting, I will indicate how the setting naturally generalizes to include the description of [[synthetic differential geometry|infinitesimal]] (pertubative) structure, [[fermionic fields]], and ([[gauge field|gauge]]) fields with [[internal symmetries]].

  **Towards Non-Perturbative BV-Theory via Derived
Geometry and the Puzzle of Quantisation**

  cf.: [arXiv:arXiv:2307.15106](BV-BRST+formalism#AlfonsiYoung23)

  > In this talk I will introduce and discuss a global geometric framework which allows one to encode a natural [[non-perturbative field theory|non-perturbative]] generalisation of classical [[BV-formalism|Batalin–Vilkovisky(BV-)theory]]. First, I will set the stage by briefly describing the current state of the art of [[perturbative quantum field theory|perturbative]] [[BV-theory]]. Then, I will introduce a concrete model of [derived differential geometry]], whose geometric objects are [[formal geometry|formal]] [[derived geometry|derived]] [[smooth stacks]] (i.e. [[stacks]] on formal [[derived smooth manifolds]]), and which is obtained by applying [Töen-Vezzosi's homotopical algebraic geometry](derived+algebraic+geometry#ToenVezzosi04) to the theory of [[derived manifolds]] of [Spivak](derived+smooth+manifold#Spivak08) and [Carchedi-Steffens](derived+smooth+manifold#CarchediSteffens19). I will explain how derived differential geometry is able to capture non-perturbative classical BV-theory by means of examples: [[scalar field theory]] and [[Yang-Mills theory]]. Finally, I will discuss some open questions, most importantly on [[quantisation]] and on applications to global aspects of [[M-theory]].

  **Decomposition of 2D Pure Yang-Mills and the Gross-
Taylor String Theory**

  slides: [[Sharpe-MTheoryMath2024.pdf:file]]

  cf.: [arXiv:2307.08729](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08729)

  > In this talk, we will attempt to reconcile two different results on [[D=2 Yang-Mills theory|two-dimensional pure Yang-Mills theory]]. Specifically, we will discuss how the fact that [[D=2 Yang-Mills theory|2d pure Yang-Mills]] is equivalent to a disjoint union of theories, is related to the Gross-Taylor description of 2d pure Yang-Mills as the [[target space|target-space]] field theory of a [[string theory]]. The Gross-Taylor picture can be understood by first rewriting the Yang-Mills partition function (in a [[large N limit|large $N$ limit]]) as a sum of [[correlation functions]] in [[Dijkgraaf-Witten theories]] for the [[symmetric group]] $S_n$, and then interpreting those Dijkgraaf-Witten correlation functions in terms of [[branched covers]], which leads to the string theory description. We first observe that the decomposition of the pure Yang-Mills aligns perfectly with the decomposition of $S_n$ Dijkgraaf-Witten theory, and then discuss decomposition and the branched covers interpretation. We encounter two puzzles, and to solve them, propose that the Gross-Taylor string theory has a [[higher form symmetry|higher-form symmetry]].

  [[Ruben Minasian]]:

  **Constraining and Un-constraining Supergravities**

  > I will review various aspects and somewhat surprising consequences of cancellation of (different types of) [[anomalies]] in [[supergravity]] theories in [[D=8 supergravity|eight]] and [[D=6 supergravity|six]] dimensions. I will also discuss appearance and importance of exotic (singular, non-spin, non-orientable) [[background field|backgrounds]].

  **Kaluza-Klein Spectrometry for String Theory
Compactifications**

  cf.: [arXiv:2212.01135](exceptional+field+theory#DuboeufMalekSamtleben23)

  > I will present a powerful new method that for the first time allows us to compute the [[Kaluza-Klein theory|Kaluza-Klein]] spectrum of a large class of [[string theory]] [[KK-compactification|compactifications]], including those arising in maximal [[gauged supergravities]] and beyond. This includes geometries with little to no remaining ([[supersymmetry|super]]-)[[symmetries]], completely inaccessible by previous methods. I will show how these insights can be used to [[holographic principle|holographically]] compute the anomalous dimensions of protected and unprotected operators in [[non-perturbative quantum field theory|strongly-coupled]] [[CFTs]], as well as to study global properties of their conformal manifolds. I will also show how the method can be used to determine the perturbative stability of non supersymmetric [[anti-de Sitter spacetime|AdS]] [[string theory vacuum|vacua]]. We will see the importance of higher Kaluza-Klein modes to the physics of string compactifications, e.g. in realising the compactness of moduli spaces, restoring [[supersymmetry]] that is lost in a consistent truncation, and in destabilising vacua that appear to stable in lower-dimensional supergravities.

  **Cubic Forms, Anomaly Cancellation and Modularity**

  cf.: [arXiv:2005.02344](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.02344)

  > [Freed and Hopkins developed](D=11+N=1+supergravity#FreedHopkins21) an algebraic theory of cubic forms, which is an analogy to the theory of [[quadratic forms]] in topology. They are motivated by the Witten-Freed-Hopkins anomaly cancellation formula in [[M-theory]], which equals a cubic form arising from an [[E8|$E_8$]] [[principal bundle|bundle]] over a 12 dimensional [[spin manifold]] to the [[index of a Dirac operator|indices]] of twisted [[Dirac operators]] on the manifold. In this talk, we will first review the Witten-Freed-Hopkins anomaly cancellation formula and the algebraic theory of cubic forms, and then show that the cubic forms as well as the anomaly cancellation formula can be naturally derived from [[modular forms]] that we construct inspired by the [[Witten genus]] and the basic representation of [[affine Lie algebra|affine]] [[E8|$\mathfrak{e}_8$]]. Following this approach, we obtain new cubic forms and anomaly cancellation formulas on non-spin manifolds and thus provide a unified way to obtain anomaly cancellation formulas of this type. This is based on our [joint work](D=D11+N=1+supergravity#HanHuangLiuZhang20) with Prof. [[Ruizhi Huang]], Prof. [[Kefeng Liu]] and Prof. [[Weiping Zhang]].

  **Topological-Holomorphic $\mathcal{N}=4$ Gauge Theory: From Langlands Duality of Holomorphic Invariants to Mirror Symmetry of Quasi-Topological Strings**

  cf.: [arXiv:2305.15965](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15965)

  > We perform a topological-holomorphic [[topological twist|twist]] of $\mathcal{N}=4$ [[super Yang-Mills theory|supersymmetric gauge theory]] on a [[4-manifold|four-manifold]] of the form $M^4 = \mathbb{C}_1 \times \mathbb{C}_2$, and unravel the mathematical implications of its physics. In particular, we consider the cohomology of different linear combinations of the resulting scalar supercharges under [[S-duality]], whence we would be able to derive novel topological and holomorphic invariants of $M^4$ and their [[geometric Langlands duality|Langlands duals]]. As the twisted theory can be topological along $\mathbb{C}_1$ such that we can [[KK-reduction|dimensionally reduce]] it to 2d, via the [[effective field theory|effective]] [[sigma-model]] on $\mathbb{C}_2$, we can also relate these 4d invariants and their Langlands duals to the [[mirror symmetry]] of [[Higgs bundles]] and that of quasi-topological strings described by the sheaf of [[chiral differential operators]].

  > Our understanding of [[M-theory]] is based on a [[duality in string theory|duality web]] connecting different limits of the theory. I'll discuss the extension of this duality web to a wide variety of decoupling limits related by duality to the null reduction of M-theory (and hence to the proposal that M-theory can be described by [[BFSS matrix model|Matrix theory]]). From a modern perspective, these limits involve non-[[relativistic field theory|relativistic]] geometries, leading to new variants of [[supergravity]] in [[D=11 supergravity|11-]] and [[D=10 supergravity|10-dimensions]]. I'll discuss how to systematically explore these corners of M-theory, following the roadmap of [arxiv.org/abs/2311.10564](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10564).

  >  [[D-brane instanton|D-instantons]] give [[non-perturbative contribution]] to [[string amplitudes]]. While the [[world-sheet]] theory of [[open string|open]] and [[closed strings]] gives a systematic procedure for computing these amplitudes, the analysis runs into [[infrared divergences]] that do not have any known cure within the [[world-sheet]] formalism. We describe how [[string field theory]] cures these divergences and gives an unambiguous procedure for computing [[D-brane instanton|D-instanton]] correction to [[string amplitudes]].

  > 4d [[FRW model|Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker cosmologies]] are obtained from time-dependent [[KK-compactification|compactifications]] of [[type II supergravity|Type IIA 10d supergravity]] on various classes of 6d manifolds. These cosmologies are universal in that they do not depend on the detailed features of the compactification manifold, but only on the properties which are common to all the manifolds belonging to that class. Once the [[equations of motion]] are rewritten as an appropriate [[dynamical system]], the existence of solutions featuring a phase of accelerated [[cosmic inflation|expansion]] is made manifest. Some of the resulting cosmologies exhibit eternal or semi-eternal acceleration, whereas others allow for a parametric control on the number of $\mathrm{e}$-foldings. Moreover, we find several smooth accelerating cosmologies without [[Big Bang]] [[singularities]]: the [[observable universe|universe]] is contracting in the cosmological past ($T \lt 0$), expanding in the future ($T \gt 0$), while in the vicinity of $T = 0$ it becomes [[de Sitter spacetime|de Sitter]] in hyperbolic slicing. We also obtain several cosmologies featuring an infinite number of cycles of alternating periods of accelerated and decelerated expansions.

We introduce the twisted [[Bismut-Chern character]] form, a loop space refinement of the [[twisted Chern character]] form, which represent classes in the completed periodic exotic twisted [[circle group|$S^1$]]-[[equivariant de Rham  cohomology|equivariant cohomology]] of $\mathcal{L}Z$. We establish a localisation theorem for the completed periodic exotic twisted $S^1$-equivariant cohomology for loop spaces and apply it to establish [[topological T-duality|T-duality]] in a [[background field|background]] [[flux]] in [[type II String Theory]] from a [[loop space]] perspective. Finally we reinterpret these results as [[topological T-duality|T-duality]] for the 1D sigma model.

  > [[T-duality]] in [[string theory]] can be realised as a transformation acting on the [[worldsheet]] fields in the two-dimensional nonlinear [[sigma model]]. [Bouwknegt-Evslin-Mathai](topological+T-duality#BouwknegtEvslinMathai04) established the [[topological T-duality|T-duality in a background flux]] for the first time upon compactifying spacetime in one direction to a principal circle by constructing the T-dual maps transforming the twisted cohomology of the dual spacetimes. In this talk, we will describe our recent work on how to promote the T-duality maps of Bouwknegt-Evslin-Mathai in two aspects. More precisely, we will introduce (1) graded T-duality, concerning the graded T-duality maps of all levels of twistings; (2) the 2-dimensional sigma model picture, concerning the [[iterated loop space|double]] loop space of spacetimes. This represents our joint work with Mathai.

  > In this talk I will review work on 'decomposition', a property of 2d [[field theory|theories]] with [[2-group|1-form symmetries]] and, more generally, d-dim'l theories with [[higher gauge theory|$(d-1)$-form symmetries]]. Decomposition is the observation that such [[quantum field theories]] are equivalent to ('decompose into’) [[disjoint unions]] of other QFTs, known in this context as "universes".

  > Examples include two-dimensional gauge theories and [[orbifolds]] with matter invariant under a [[subgroup]] of the [[gauge group]]. Decomposition explains and relates several physical properties of these theories -- for example, restrictions on allowed [[instantons]] arise as a "multiverse interference effect" between contributions from constituent universes.

  > First worked out in 2006 as part of efforts to understand [[string]] propagation on [[stacks]], decomposition has been the driver of a number of developments since. I will walk through general aspects of 2d gauge theories that exhibit decomposition, dive into specifics in orbifold examples, and as time permits, discuss recent work in progress.

  > Some time ago, [[D=14 supersymmetry|Bars and Sezgin proposed]] a [[super Yang-Mills theory]] in $D=s+t=11+3$ space-time dimensions, with an electric 3-brane that generalizes the 2-brane of M-theory. More recently, Rios, Chester and the speaker found an infinite family of "exceptional" super Yang-Mills theories in $D=s+t=(8n+3)+3$. A particularly interesting case occurs for $n=3$, namely in signature $D=27+3$, in which the superalgebra is centrally extended by an electric 11-brane and its 15-brane magnetic dual. The worldvolume symmetry of the 11-brane has signature $D=11+3$ and can reproduce super Yang-Mills theory in D=$11+3$. Upon reduction to $D=26+2$, the 11-brane reduces to a 10-brane with $10+2$ worldvolume signature. A single time projection gives a $10+1$ worldvolume signature, and it can serve as a model for $D=10+1$ [[M-theory]] as a reduction from the $D=26+1$ signature of the [[bosonic M-theory]] of [[Gary Horowitz|Horowitz]] and [[Leonard Susskind|Susskind]]; this is further confirmed by the reduction of chiral $(1,0)$, $D=11+3$ superalgebra to the $\mathcal{N}=1$ superalgebra in $D=10+1$, as found by Rudychev, Sezgin and Sundell some time ago. Extending previous results of Dijkgraaf, Verlinde and Verlinde, I will also put forward the realization of spinors as total cohomologies of (the largest spatially extended) branes which centrally extend the $(1,0)$ superalgebra underlying the corresponding "exceptional" super Yang-Mills theory. Moreover, by making use of an “anomalous” Dynkin embedding, I will present further evidence about [[Pierre Ramond|Ramond]]'s and [[Hisham Sati|Sati]]'s argument that M-theory has hidden Cayley plane fibers.

  > As reviewed in [[nLab:Hisham Sati|H.

In this talk I review the further [[nLab:(infinity,1)-topos|geometric]] refinement of the [[nLab:cohomology|cohomology theory]] to [[nLab:equivariant|equivariant Cohomotoy theory]] and to [[nLab:differential cohomotopy|differential Cohomotopy theory]]. Now we find that [[Hypothesis H]] implies also the Witten mechanism of multiple [[nLab:M5-branes]] on [[nLab:MO5]]-[[nLab:orientifolds]] in [[nLab:heterotic M-theory on ADE-orbifolds]], hence [[nLab:RR-field tadpole cancellation]] in [[nLab:type I' string theory]]; as well as a multitude of effects associated with [[nLab:Dp-D(p+2) brane bound state|Dp/D(p+2)-brane intersections]]: [[nLab:Chan-Paton factors]], [[nLab:BMN matrix model]] [[nLab:fuzzy funnel]] states and [[nLab:BLG 3-algebras]], the [[nLab:Hanany-Witten rules]], [[nLab:AdS3/CFT2|AdS3-gravity]] observables, [[nLab:supersymmetric indices]] of [[nLab:Coulomb branches]] as well as [[nLab:AdS/CFT|gauge/gravity duality]] between all these. This suggests that [[Hypothesis H]] is a correct assumption about the elusive mathematical fomulation of [[nLab:M-theory]].
This is joint work with [[nLab:Hisham Sati|H. Sati]] ([[schreiber:Equivariant Cohomotopy implies orientifold tadpole cancellation|arxiv:1909.12277]], [[schreiber:Differential Cohomotopy implies intersecting brane observables|arxiv:1912.10425]]).

  > In the [[AdS/CFT in condensed matter physics|spirit of the gauge-gravity correspondence]], we derive a 2+1 dimensional model with "unconventional" supersymmetry at the boundary of a 4-dimensional Anti de Sitter N-extended supergravity, which in the case N=2 reproduces the AVZ model [P.D. Alvarez, M. Valenzuela, J. Zanelli, JHEP 1204 (2012) 058, arXiv:1109.3944 [hep-th]]. The extended supersymmetry of the boundary model is instrumental to describe the electronic properties of [[graphene]], in particular at the two Dirac points. The two valleys correspond to the two independent sectors of the OSp(p|2)×OSp(q|2) boundary model in the p=q case, which are related by a parity transformation. The Semenoff and the Haldane masses entering the corresponding Dirac equations for the graphene pseudoparticles are identified with supergravity torsion parameters.

  > The [[Hopf-Wess-Zumino term|6d Wess-Zumino term]] in the [[action functional]] for the [[M5-brane]] is anomalous as traditionally defined. What has been missing is a condition implying a higher analogue of level quantization familiar from the 2d [[WZW term|Wess-Zumino term]]. We prove that such an anomaly cancellation condition is implied by the [[Hypothesis H|hypothesis]] that the [[supergravity C-field|C-field]] is [[Dirac charge quantization|charge-quantized]] in [[twisted cohomotopy|twisted]] [[Cohomotopy theory]]. The proof follows by a twisted/parametrized generalization of the [[Hopf invariant]], after identifying the [[Hopf-Wess-Zumino term|6d Wess-Zumino term]] with a twisted [[Whitehead integral formula|homotopy Whitehead integral formula]], which we establish.
