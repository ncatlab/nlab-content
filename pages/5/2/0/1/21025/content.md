  >  [[D-brane instanton|D-instantons]] give [[non-perturbative contribution]] to [[string amplitudes]]. While the [[world-sheet]] theory of [[open string|open]] and [[closed strings]] gives a systematic procedure for computing these amplitudes, the analysis runs into [[infrared divergences]] that do not have any known cure within the [[world-sheet]] formalism. We describe how [[string field theory]] cures these divergences and gives an unambiguous procedure for computing [[D-brane instanton|D-instanton]] correction to [[string amplitudes]].

This provides a [[UV completion|UV complete]] five-dimensional [[quantum field theory|field theoretic]] description that we will argue admits a six-dimensional Lorentz invariance at [[non-perturbative quantum field theory|strong coupling]].

  > 4d [[FRW model|Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker cosmologies]] are obtained from time-dependent [[KK-compactification|compactifications]] of [[type II supergravity|Type IIA 10d supergravity]] on various classes of 6d manifolds. These cosmologies are universal in that they do not depend on the detailed features of the compactification manifold, but only on the properties which are common to all the manifolds belonging to that class. Once the [[equations of motion]] are rewritten as an appropriate [[dynamical system]], the existence of solutions featuring a phase of accelerated [[cosmic inflation|expansion]] is made manifest. Some of the resulting cosmologies exhibit eternal or semi-eternal acceleration, whereas others allow for a parametric control on the number of $\mathrm{e}$-foldings. Moreover, we find several smooth accelerating cosmologies without [[Big Bang]] [[singularities]]: the [[observable universe|universe]] is contracting in the cosmological past ($T \lt 0$), expanding in the future ($T \gt 0$), while in the vicinity of $T = 0$ it becomes [[de Sitter spacetime|de Sitter]] in hyperbolic slicing. We also obtain several cosmologies featuring an infinite number of cycles of alternating periods of accelerated and decelerated expansions.

  > We define exotic [[twisted de Rham cohomology|twisted]] [[circle group|$S^1$]]-[[equivariant de Rham cohomology|equivariant cohomology]] for the [[free loop space|loop space]] $\mathcal{L}Z$ of a [[smooth manifold]] $Z$ via the [[invariant]] [[differential forms]] on $\mathcal{L}Z$ with [[coefficients]] in the (typically non-flat) [[higher holonomy|holonomy]] [[complex line bundle|line bundle]] of a [[bundle gerbe|gerbe]], with differential given by an equivariantly [[flat connection|flat]] [[superconnection]]. We introduce the twisted [[Bismut-Chern character]] form, a loop space refinement of the [[twisted Chern character]] form, which represent classes in the completed periodic exotic twisted [[circle group|$S^1$]]-[[equivariant de Rham  cohomology|equivariant cohomology]] of $\mathcal{L}Z$. We establish a localisation theorem for the completed periodic exotic twisted $S^1$-equivariant cohomology for loop spaces and apply it to establish [[topological T-duality|T-duality]] in a [[background field|background]] [[flux]] in [[type II String Theory]] from a [[loop space]] perspective. Finally we reinterpret these results as [[topological T-duality|T-duality]] for the 1D sigma model.

  > [[T-duality]] in [[string theory]] can be realised as a transformation acting on the [[worldsheet]] fields in the two-dimensional nonlinear [[sigma model]]. [Bouwknegt-Evslin-Mathai](topological+T-duality#BouwknegtEvslinMathai04) established the [[topological T-duality|T-duality in a background flux]] for the first time upon compactifying spacetime in one direction to a principal circle by constructing the T-dual maps transforming the twisted cohomology of the dual spacetimes. In this talk, we will describe our recent work on how to promote the T-duality maps of Bouwknegt-Evslin-Mathai in two aspects. More precisely, we will introduce (1) graded T-duality, concerning the graded T-duality maps of all levels of twistings; (2) the 2-dimensional sigma model picture, concerning the [[iterated loop space|double]] loop space of spacetimes. This represents our joint work with Mathai.

  > I will introduce the notion of [[adjusted Weil algebra|adjusted curvatures]] for [[principal infinity-bundle|higher principal bundles]]. These will allow me to [[differential cohomology|differentially refine]] the description of [[topological T-duality]] [by Nikolaus and Waldorf](T-fold#NikolausWaldorf18) in terms of [[principal 2-bundles]], leading to a description of full [[T-duality]].

  **An introduction to decomposition**

  cf.: [arXiv:2204.09117](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09117)

  > In this talk I will review work on 'decomposition', a property of 2d [[field theory|theories]] with [[2-group|1-form symmetries]] and, more generally, d-dim'l theories with [[higher gauge theory|$(d-1)$-form symmetries]]. Decomposition is the observation that such [[quantum field theories]] are equivalent to ('decompose into’) [[disjoint unions]] of other QFTs, known in this context as "universes".

  > Examples include two-dimensional gauge theories and [[orbifolds]] with matter invariant under a [[subgroup]] of the [[gauge group]]. Decomposition explains and relates several physical properties of these theories -- for example, restrictions on allowed [[instantons]] arise as a "multiverse interference effect" between contributions from constituent universes.

  > First worked out in 2006 as part of efforts to understand [[string]] propagation on [[stacks]], decomposition has been the driver of a number of developments since. I will walk through general aspects of 2d gauge theories that exhibit decomposition, dive into specifics in orbifold examples, and as time permits, discuss recent work in progress.

  > We formulate the [[open string]] version of the Born [[sigma-model]] and describe its conformal [[boundary conditions]]. This leads to a general characterisation of [[D-branes]] in [[doubled geometry]] as maximally [[isotropic subspace|isotropic]] sub-bundles on a [[para-Hermitian manifold]]. The reduction of D-branes to a physical spacetime is obtained by describing them as [[Dirac structures]]. We also introduce a para-complex counterpart of the generalised complex branes of [[generalized complex geometry|generalised geometry]].

  > The quantum odd [[symplectic category|symplectic "category"]] is constructed from the odd symplectic "category" via an enhancement of [[Lagrangian correspondence|Lagrangian relations]] (correspondences) by [[canonical Hilbert space of half-densities|half-densities]]. We extend this approach to the (finite-dimensional) setting of the [[BV-BRST formalism|Batalin-Vilkovisky quantum field theories]] (quantum L-infinity algebras).

  cf.: [arXiv:2103.06666](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.06666)

  > We will present an explicit matrix algebra quantization of the algebra of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms of the $n$-torus. That is, we approximate the corresponding classical [[Nambu brackets]] using $\mathfrak{sl}\big(N^{\lceil n/2\rceil}, \mathbb{C}\big)$-matrices equipped with the finite bracket given by the completely anti-symmetrized matrix product, such that the classical brackets are retrieved in the $N \to \infty$ limit. We then apply this approximation to the [[super 4-brane in 9 dimensions]] and give a regularized action in analogy with [the matrix quantization of the supermembrane](membrane#LightConeQuantizationOfM2BranesToBFSSMatrixModel). This action exhibits a reduced gauge symmetry that we discuss from the viewpoint of [[L-infinity algebras|$L_\infty$-algebras]] in a slight generalization to the construction of [[Lie 2-algebras]] from [[M-brane 3-algebra|Bagger-Lambert 3-algebras]].

  >  In this talk I will discuss some general methods for realizing topological symmetry generators in [[holography]]. In particular I will present a specific realization of non-invertible symmetry generators and their fusion rules in holographic duals of $SU(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N$ [[SYM]]. This will be both from a [[bottom-up and top-down model building|bottom-up perspective]] from an [[effective field theory|effective theory]] in [[anti de Sitter spacetime|$AdS_5$]], and from a [[bottom-up and top-down model building|top-down perspective]] in terms of [[D-branes]] in $AdS_5$ backgrounds.

  > Various flavors of [[topological K-theory|K-theory]] [[D-brane charge quantization in K-theory|play an important role]] in geometric/topological perspectives on [[string theory]]. Ultimately, the [[twisted equivariant differential K-theory|twisted equivariant differential (TED) version of K-theory]] would be what is needed to describe [[field (physics)|fields]] and [[branes]] in the most general backgrounds. However, this theory has not been constructed yet, but major progress has been made in that direction requiring highly nontrivial machinery. I will describe the main conceptual points here. I will also explain how TED K-theory enters naturally into [[condensed matter theory|condensed matter]] ([[topological phases of matter|topological phases]]) and highlight analogies with [[high energy physics]]. All of this embeds in [[M-theory]] via [[schreiber:Hypothesis H]], both from physical and mathematical perspectives.

  >  The [[AdS-QCD correspondence|promising idea]] that [[non-perturbative field theory|strongly]] [[coupling|coupled]] [[quantum systems]] such as ([[confinement|confined]] [[QCD]] or) [[topological order|topologically ordered]] [[quantum materials]] are [[AdS-CMT duality|usefully modeled]] as [[worldvolume]] [[dynamics]] on [[intersecting branes]] in [[string theory]] has been suffering from the latter's lack of [[nLab:non-perturbative effect|non-perturbative]] formulation ([[M-theory]]), [necessary](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/AdS-CFT#SmallNCorrections) in the realistic regime of [[large 1/N limit|small numbers]] of individual [[branes]] (i.e. beyond the usual [[holography|holographic]] [[large N limit|large-$N$ approximation]]). In this talk I will briefly review our "[[schreiber:Hypothesis H]]" that [[brane]] [[nLab:charge]] in [[nlab:M-theory]] is [[nLab:Dirac charge quantization|quantized]] in a [[nlab:twisted cohomology|twisted]] [[nLab:equivariant cohomology|equivariant]] [[nLab:non-abelian cohomology|non-abelian]] [[nLab:generalized cohomology]] theory called *[[nLab:Cohomotopy]]*, where [[nLab:M-brane]] [[nLab:quantum states]] are identified inside the [[nLab:twisted de Rham cohomology|twisted equivariant cohomology]] of the [[nLab:Cohomotopy]] [[nLab:moduli stack]]. Then I explain our recent derivation, from this assumption, of [[nLab:anyon|anyonic]] [[nLab:topological order]] in [[nLab:ground states]] of [[nLab:M3-brane|M5-brane intersections]]; and I close with an outlook on how this describes [[nlab:topological quantum computation|topological]] [[nLab:quantum logic gates]] via [[nlab:braid group statistics|braiding]] of [[nLab:defect branes]].

Each of these targets has the [[dynamics]] of [[supergravity]] embedded into its structure. The target for $(11-k)$-dimensional [[M-theory]] also has an [[Lie algebra representation|action]] of the [[Lie algebra]] of [[exceptional Lie algebra|type $E_k$]], responsible for [[U-duality|symmetries]] of $(11-k)$-dim [[supergravity]] along with its [[equations of motion]] in any spacetime.

  cf.: [arXiv:1906.10709](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.10709)

  > Some time ago, [[D=14 supersymmetry|Bars and Sezgin proposed]] a [[super Yang-Mills theory]] in $D=s+t=11+3$ space-time dimensions, with an electric 3-brane that generalizes the 2-brane of M-theory. More recently, Rios, Chester and the speaker found an infinite family of "exceptional" super Yang-Mills theories in $D=s+t=(8n+3)+3$. A particularly interesting case occurs for $n=3$, namely in signature $D=27+3$, in which the superalgebra is centrally extended by an electric 11-brane and its 15-brane magnetic dual. The worldvolume symmetry of the 11-brane has signature $D=11+3$ and can reproduce super Yang-Mills theory in D=$11+3$. Upon reduction to $D=26+2$, the 11-brane reduces to a 10-brane with $10+2$ worldvolume signature. A single time projection gives a $10+1$ worldvolume signature, and it can serve as a model for $D=10+1$ [[M-theory]] as a reduction from the $D=26+1$ signature of the [[bosonic M-theory]] of [[Gary Horowitz|Horowitz]] and [[Leonard Susskind|Susskind]]; this is further confirmed by the reduction of chiral $(1,0)$, $D=11+3$ superalgebra to the $\mathcal{N}=1$ superalgebra in $D=10+1$, as found by Rudychev, Sezgin and Sundell some time ago. Extending previous results of Dijkgraaf, Verlinde and Verlinde, I will also put forward the realization of spinors as total cohomologies of (the largest spatially extended) branes which centrally extend the $(1,0)$ superalgebra underlying the corresponding "exceptional" super Yang-Mills theory. Moreover, by making use of an “anomalous” Dynkin embedding, I will present further evidence about [[Pierre Ramond|Ramond]]'s and [[Hisham Sati|Sati]]'s argument that M-theory has hidden Cayley plane fibers.

  video: [YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7pQkyqCiA4)

  > In this talk I will propose the notion of [[derived geometry|derived]] [[n-plectic geometry|$n$-plectic geometry]] and show that a classical [[BV formalism|BV-BFV theory]] can be globally reformulated in this framework.

  > A derived $n$-plectic structure is a [[derived geometry|derived]] and [[categorification|categorified]] generalisation of a [[symplectic structure]], where the usual [[closed differential form|closed]] [[differential 2-form|2-form]] is replaced by a shifted closed $(n+1)$-form on a [[derived manifold|derived space]]. I will argue that derived $n$-plectic geometry is to classical BV-BFV theory as ordinary $n$-plectic geometry is to ordinary [[Lagrangian field theory]]. I will also discuss the rich [[homotopical algebra|homotopy-algebraic]] structure of [[observables]] of a derived $n$-plectic space. Finally, I will point at promising applications of this formalism to [[non-perturbative quantum field theory|non-perturbative]] [[quantisation]] of [[BV formalism|BV-BFV theories]] and to global aspects of [[M-theory]].

  > To every ([[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]]) background of [[d=11 supergravity]] there is associated a [[filtered object|filtered]] [[super Lie algebra|Lie superalgebra]]. For ($\gt 1/2$)-[[BPS state|BPS backgrounds]], this Lie superalgebra determines the background up to local [[isometry]]. I will then report on an [[Spencer cohomology|algebraic reformulation]] of this classification problem. This is [joint work with Andrea Santi](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Spencer+cohomology#FFS17).

  > [[Cohomotopy theory]] has recently emerged as the proper [[generalized cohomology|generalized cohomology theory]] to describe the [[field (physics)|fields]] in [[M-theory]]. It is hoped that viewing M-theory from a mathematical perspective will shed the light on the nature of the theory and will allow for progress. I will survey this area, illustrating how cohomotopy captures the nature of the [[nLab:supergravity C-field|C-field]] and its dual as well as of the [[M-branes]], allows for cancellation of various [[nLab:quantum anomaly|anomalies]], and provides a firm grounding for further study of M-theory. This is joint work [[Urs Schreiber]] and [[Domenico Fiorenza]].

  > As reviewed in [[nLab:Hisham Sati|H. Sati]]'s talk, assuming that the [[nLab:supergravity C-field|C-field]] is [[nLab:Dirac charge quantization|charge-quantized]] in the [[nLab:generalized cohomology theory]] called [[nLab:J-homomorphism|J-]][[nLab:twisted cohomotopy|twisted]] [[nLab:Cohomotopy]] ("[[Hypothesis H]]") implies a list of [[nLab:M-theory|M-theoretic]] [[nLab:anomaly cancellation]] conditions, such as [[nLab:shifted C-field flux quantization]], DMW anomaly cancellation and [[nLab:C-field tadpole cancellation]] [[nLab:M-theory on 8-manifolds|on 8-manifolds]]. In this talk I review the further [[nLab:(infinity,1)-topos|geometric]] refinement of the [[nLab:cohomology|cohomology theory]] to [[nLab:equivariant|equivariant Cohomotoy theory]] and to [[nLab:differential cohomotopy|differential Cohomotopy theory]]. Now we find that [[Hypothesis H]] implies also the Witten mechanism of multiple [[nLab:M5-branes]] on [[nLab:MO5]]-[[nLab:orientifolds]] in [[nLab:heterotic M-theory on ADE-orbifolds]], hence [[nLab:RR-field tadpole cancellation]] in [[nLab:type I' string theory]]; as well as a multitude of effects associated with [[nLab:Dp-D(p+2) brane bound state|Dp/D(p+2)-brane intersections]]: [[nLab:Chan-Paton factors]], [[nLab:BMN matrix model]] [[nLab:fuzzy funnel]] states and [[nLab:BLG 3-algebras]], the [[nLab:Hanany-Witten rules]], [[nLab:AdS3/CFT2|AdS3-gravity]] observables, [[nLab:supersymmetric indices]] of [[nLab:Coulomb branches]] as well as [[nLab:AdS/CFT|gauge/gravity duality]] between all these. This suggests that [[Hypothesis H]] is a correct assumption about the elusive mathematical fomulation of [[nLab:M-theory]].
This is joint work with [[nLab:Hisham Sati|H. Sati]] ([[schreiber:Equivariant Cohomotopy implies orientifold tadpole cancellation|arxiv:1909.12277]], [[schreiber:Differential Cohomotopy implies intersecting brane observables|arxiv:1912.10425]]).

  > In the [[AdS/CFT in condensed matter physics|spirit of the gauge-gravity correspondence]], we derive a 2+1 dimensional model with "unconventional" supersymmetry at the boundary of a 4-dimensional Anti de Sitter N-extended supergravity, which in the case N=2 reproduces the AVZ model [P.D. Alvarez, M. Valenzuela, J. Zanelli, JHEP 1204 (2012) 058, arXiv:1109.3944 [hep-th]]. The extended supersymmetry of the boundary model is instrumental to describe the electronic properties of [[graphene]], in particular at the two Dirac points. The two valleys correspond to the two independent sectors of the OSp(p|2)×OSp(q|2) boundary model in the p=q case, which are related by a parity transformation. The Semenoff and the Haldane masses entering the corresponding Dirac equations for the graphene pseudoparticles are identified with supergravity torsion parameters.

  > The [[Hopf-Wess-Zumino term|6d Wess-Zumino term]] in the [[action functional]] for the [[M5-brane]] is anomalous as traditionally defined. What has been missing is a condition implying a higher analogue of level quantization familiar from the 2d [[WZW term|Wess-Zumino term]]. We prove that such an anomaly cancellation condition is implied by the [[Hypothesis H|hypothesis]] that the [[supergravity C-field|C-field]] is [[Dirac charge quantization|charge-quantized]] in [[twisted cohomotopy|twisted]] [[Cohomotopy theory]]. The proof follows by a twisted/parametrized generalization of the [[Hopf invariant]], after identifying the [[Hopf-Wess-Zumino term|6d Wess-Zumino term]] with a twisted [[Whitehead integral formula|homotopy Whitehead integral formula]], which we establish. Joint work with Hisham Sati and Urs Schreiber, [[schreiber:Twisted Cohomotopy implies M5 WZ term level quantization|arXiv:1906.07417]].
