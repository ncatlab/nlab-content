  _Supergravity in a pencil_

  download: [[CerchiaiSlidesAtMTheoryAndMathematics2020.pdf:file]]

  **Abstract:** In the [[AdS/CFT in condensed matter physics|spirit of the gauge-gravity correspondence]], we derive a 2+1 dimensional model with "unconventional" supersymmetry at the boundary of a 4-dimensional Anti de Sitter N-extended supergravity, which in the case N=2 reproduces the AVZ model [P.D. Alvarez, M. Valenzuela, J. Zanelli, JHEP 1204 (2012) 058, arXiv:1109.3944 [hep-th]]. The extended supersymmetry of the boundary model is instrumental to describe the electronic properties of [[graphene]], in particular at the two Dirac points. The two valleys correspond to the two independent sectors of the OSp(p|2)×OSp(q|2) boundary model in the p=q case, which are related by a parity transformation. The Semenoff and the Haldane masses entering the corresponding Dirac equations for the graphene pseudoparticles are identified with supergravity torsion parameters.

  _Lie superalgebra deformations and d=11 supergravity backgrounds_

  **Abstract:** To every ([[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]]) background of [[d=11 supergravity]] there is associated a [[filtered object|filtered]] [[super Lie algebra|Lie superalgebra]]. For ($\gt 1/2$)-[[BPS state|BPS backgrounds]], this Lie superalgebra determines the background up to local [[isometry]]. I will then report on an [[Spencer cohomology|algebraic reformulation]] of this classification problem. This is [joint work with Andrea Santi](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Spencer+cohomology#FFS17).

  _Twisted Cohomotopy implies level quantization of the 6d WZ term of the M5-brane_ 

  download: [pdf slides](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/FiorenzaSlidesAtMTheoryMathematics2020v2.pdf)

  **Abstract:** The [[Hopf-Wess-Zumino term|6d Wess-Zumino term]] in the [[action functional]] for the [[M5-brane]] is anomalous as traditionally defined. What has been missing is a condition implying a higher analogue of level quantization familiar from the 2d [[WZW term|Wess-Zumino term]]. We prove that such an anomaly cancellation condition is implied by the [[schreiber:Hypothesis H|hypothesis]] that the [[supergravity C-field|C-field]] is [[Dirac charge quantization|charge-quantized]] in [[twisted cohomotopy|twisted]] [[Cohomotopy theory]]. The proof follows by a twisted/parametrized generalization of the [[Hopf invariant]], after identifying the [[Hopf-Wess-Zumino term|6d Wess-Zumino term]] with a twisted [[Whitehead integral formula|homotopy Whitehead integral formula]], which we establish. Joint work with Hisham Sati and Urs Schreiber, [[schreiber:Twisted Cohomotopy implies M5 WZ term level quantization|arXiv:1906.07417]].

  _Universes as Bigdata_

  **Abstract:** We review how historically the problem of [[string phenomenology]] lead theoretical physics first to algebraic/differential geometry, and then to computational geometry, and now to data science and AI. With the concrete playground of the [[Calabi-Yau manifold|Calabi-Yau]] [[landscape of string theory vacua|landscape]], accumulated by the collaboration of physicists, mathematicians and computer scientists over the last 4 decades, we show how the latest techniques in [[machine learning|machine-learning]] can help explore problems of physical and mathematical interest.

  _M-theory and cohomotopy_

  download: [pdf slides](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/Sati_MTheoryCohomotopy_2020.pdf)

  **Abstract** [[Cohomotopy theory]] has recently emerged as the proper [[generalized cohomology|generalized cohomology theory]] to describe the [[field (physics)|fields]] in [[M-theory]]. It is hoped that viewing M-theory from a mathematical perspective will shed the light on the nature of the theory and will allow for progress. I will survey this area, illustrating how cohomotopy captures the nature of the [[nLab:supergravity C-field|C-field]] and its dual as well as of the [[M-branes]], allows for cancellation of various [[nLab:quantum anomaly|anomalies]], and provides a firm grounding for further study of M-theory. This is joint work [[Urs Schreiber]] and [[Domenico Fiorenza]].

  _[[schreiber:Microscopic Brane Physics from Cohomotopy]]_

  **Abstract:** As reviewed in [[nLab:Hisham Sati|H. Sati]]'s talk, assuming that the [[nLab:supergravity C-field|C-field]] is [[nLab:Dirac charge quantization|charge-quantized]] in the [[nLab:generalized cohomology theory]] called [[nLab:J-homomorphism|J-]][[nLab:twisted cohomotopy|twisted]] [[nLab:Cohomotopy]] ("[[schreiber:Hypothesis H]]") implies a list of [[nLab:M-theory|M-theoretic]] [[nLab:anomaly cancellation]] conditions, such as [[nLab:shifted C-field flux quantization]], DMW anomaly cancellation and [[nLab:C-field tadpole cancellation]] [[nLab:M-theory on 8-manifolds|on 8-manifolds]]. In this talk I review the further [[nLab:(infinity,1)-topos|geometric]] refinement of the [[nLab:cohomology|cohomology theory]] to [[nLab:equivariant|equivariant Cohomotoy theory]] and to [[nLab:differential cohomotopy|differential Cohomotopy theory]]. Now we find that [[schreiber:Hypothesis H]] implies also the Witten mechanism of multiple [[nLab:M5-branes]] on [[nLab:MO5]]-[[nLab:orientifolds]] in [[nLab:heterotic M-theory on ADE-orbifolds]], hence [[nLab:RR-field tadpole cancellation]] in [[nLab:type I' string theory]]; as well as a multitude of effects associated with [[nLab:Dp-D(p+2) brane bound state|Dp/D(p+2)-brane intersections]]: [[nLab:Chan-Paton factors]], [[nLab:BMN matrix model]] [[nLab:fuzzy funnel]] states and [[nLab:BLG 3-algebras]], the [[nLab:Hanany-Witten rules]], [[nLab:AdS3/CFT2|AdS3-gravity]] observables, [[nLab:supersymmetric indices]] of [[nLab:Coulomb branches]] as well as [[nLab:AdS/CFT|gauge/gravity duality]] between all these.
This suggests that [[schreiber:Hypothesis H]] is a correct assumption about the elusive mathematical fomulation of [[nLab:M-theory]].
This is joint work with [[nLab:Hisham Sati|H. Sati]] ([[schreiber:Equivariant Cohomotopy implies orientifold tadpole cancellation|arxiv:1909.12277]], [[schreiber:Differential Cohomotopy implies intersecting brane observables|arxiv:1912.10425]]).
