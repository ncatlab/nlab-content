## Idea

The concept of $2$-Hilbert space is supposed to be a [[categorification]] of that of [[Hilbert space]], or at least of [[finite-dimensional vector space|finite dimensional]] such: [[inner product spaces]]. 

One way to define this is as a [[Kapranov-Voevodsky 2-vector space]] where the [[hom-functor]] plays the role of the [[categorification|categorified]] [[inner product]] ([Baez 96](#Baez96)).

More generally this works for [[semisimple categories]] (...)
