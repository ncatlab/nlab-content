## Idea

By a *weakly constant function*  one means a [[function]] which is equipped with a certain sort of "witness of [[constant function|constancy]]".  

However, in [[higher category theory]] and [[homotopy theory]], it is debatable whether or not this witness really exhibits "constancy", hence the use of a different word.  (The term "steady function" was suggested by [[Andrej Bauer]] but did not catch on.)


## Definition

In [[homotopy type theory]], a [[function type|function]] 

$$
  f\colon A\to B
$$ 

is *weakly constant* if we have a [[term]] of [[type]] of the [[dependent product]] over the [[identification types]] of all the values of $f$ on all [[pairs]] of arguments:

$$ 
  \prod_{(x,y:A)}
  (f x = f y)  
  \,.
$$

By regarding [[homotopy type theory]] as the [[internal logic]] of an [[(âˆž,1)-topos]], we obtain a definition that makes sense in any [[(infinity,1)-category|$\infty$-category]] with [[binary products]]: a morphism $f:A\to B$ is *weakly constant* if the two composites $A\times A \rightrightarrows A \xrightarrow{f} B$ are [[equivalence in an (infinity,1)-category|equivalent]].


## Relationship to constancy

If $f$ is [[constant function|constant]] in the sense that it factors through the [[terminal object]] (i.e. we have $f = \lambda x. b$ for some $b:B$), then $f$ is obviously weakly constant.  The converse holds if we know that the [[domain]] $A$ is [[inhabited type|inhabited]], for if $a_0:A$, then $f a = f a_0$ for all $a:A$.  However, the [[identity function]] of the [[empty type]] is weakly constant, yet not equal to $\lambda x.b$ for any $b:\varnothing$ (since no such $b$ exists).

More generally, if $f$ factors through the [[propositional truncation]] ${\|A\|}$, then it is weakly constant, since any two [[elements]] of ${\|A\|}$ are equal (i.e. it is an [[h-proposition]]).  In fact, this is true if $f$ factors through *any* [[h-proposition]] (in which case it in fact also factors through ${\|A\|}$, by the [[universal property]] of the latter).

The converse to this last implication does hold for some specific $f:A\to B$, such as:

* If $B$ is an [[h-set]].  For then $f$ factors through the [[0-truncation]] ${\|A\|_0}$, and the set-[[coequalizer]] of the two [[projections]] ${\|A\|_0} \times {\|A\|_0} \to {\|A\|_0}$ is the [[propositional truncation]].

* If $A$ has [[split support]].  For then we have a composite ${\|A\|} \to A \xrightarrow{f} B$, whose restriction to $A$ is equal to $f$ by weak constancy.

* If $A=P+Q$, with $P$ and $Q$ [[h-propositions]].  For then ${\|A\|}$ is the [[join]] $P*Q$ of $P$ and $Q$, i.e. the [[pushout]] of the two [[projections]] $P \leftarrow P\times Q \to Q$.  The [[universal property]] of this pushout says exactly that any weakly constant map $P+Q\to B$ factors through $P*Q = \Vert P+Q\Vert$.

* If $A=B$ (see below).

However, it can fail in general, even when $A$ is [[mere proposition|merely]] inhabited (i.e. ${\|A\|}= 1$).  For instance, let $A=P+Q+R$ for h-propositions $P$, $Q$, and $R$, and let $B$ be the triple pushout of $P$, $Q$, and $R$ under $P\times Q$, $P\times R$, and $Q\times R$.  Then there is a steady map $f:A\to B$, but there exist models in which ${\|A\|} = 1$ but $B$ has no [[global element]].  The most straightforward such model is [[presheaves]] on the [[poset]] of proper [[subsets]] of $\{a,b,c\}$, with $P=\{a,b\}$, $Q=\{b,c\}$, and $R=\{a,c\}$.  In this model, we have $B(S) = 1$ for all nonempty proper subsets $S$, while $B(\emptyset) = S^1$, and $B$ has no global sections.

See [this discussion](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/homotopytypetheory/FeBAScTgwzg/Dx6E3-ezdxIJ).

In general, being weakly constant may be regarded as an "incoherent approximation" to constancy in the sense of factoring through an [[h-proposition]].  Indeed for a set $A$, its propositional truncation is the set-[[coequalizer]] of $A\times A\rightrightarrows A$.  However, in general such a construction requires the realization of a whole [[simplicial diagram]] (the simplicial [[kernel]] of the map $A\to 1$).


## Weakly constant endomaps

While an arbitrary weakly constant function is not very [[coherence law|coherent]], a weakly constant [[endofunction]] $f:A\to A$ has some extra degree of "coherence", as witnessed by the following results of [(KECA)](#KECA).

+-- {: .un_lemma}
###### Lemma
If $f:A\to A$ is weakly constant, then the type $Fix(f) \coloneqq \sum_{x:A} (f x = x)$ is an [[h-proposition]], and equivalent to ${\|A\|}$.
=--
+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
Suppose $H: \prod_{(x,y:A)} (f x = f y)$, and let $(a,p),(b,q):Fix(f)$; we want to show $(a,p)=(b,q)$.  Let $r:a=b$ be the concatenated path
$$ a \xrightarrow{p^{-1}} f a \xrightarrow{H_{a,a}^{-1}} f a \xrightarrow{H_{a,b}} f b \xrightarrow{q} b. $$
It will suffice to show that $p \bullet r = ap_f(r) \bullet q$, where $ap_f$ denotes the action of $f$ on paths.  However, the dependent action of $H$ on paths implies that $H_{x,y} \bullet ap_f(s) = H_{x,y'}$ for any $x:A$ and any $s:y=y'$, and in particular $ap_f(r) = H_{a,a}^{-1} \bullet H_{a,b}$.  From this $p \bullet r = ap_f(r) \bullet q$ is immediate.  Thus, $Fix(f)$ is an h-proposition.

Now we have a map $g:A\to Fix(f)$ defined by $g(x) \coloneqq (f x, H_{f x,x})$, so by the universal property of ${\|A\|}$, we have ${\|A\|} \to Fix(f)$.  On the other hand, we have the first projection $pr_1:Fix(f) \to A$, and hence $Fix(f) \to {\|A\|}$.  Thus, these two h-propositions are equal.

###### Theorem
A type $A$ has [[split support]] if and only if it admits a weakly constant endomap $f:A\to A$.
=--
+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
Given ${\|A\|} \to A$, the composite $A\to {\|A\|} \to \A$ is weakly constant.  Conversely, if $f$ is steady, $Fix(f) = {\|A\|}$ by the lemma, so $pr_1:Fix(f) \to A$ splits the support of $A$.
=--

Note that $pr_1 \circ g = f$, so that if we start with a weakly constant endomap of $A$, deduce a splitting of the support of $A$, and then reconstruct a weakly constant endomap, we obtain the same map.  However, the proof of steadiness is generally different from the one we began with, so this "logical equivalence" is not an equivalence of types.

###### Corollary
A type $A$ is an [[h-set]] if and only if every [[identity type]] $x=_A y$ admits a weakly constant endomap.
=--
+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
We know that $A$ is an h-set just when all $x=_A y$ have split support.
