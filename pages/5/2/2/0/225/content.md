## Definition

Given [[category|categories]] $C$ and $D$, the **functor category** -- written $D^C$ or $[C,D]$ -- is the category whosse

* [[object]]s are [[functor|functors]] $F: C \to D$  

* [[morphism]]s are [[natural transformation|natural transformations]] between these functors.

 
Functor categories serve as the [[hom-category|hom-categories]] in the [[strict 2-category]] [[Cat]].

In the context of [[enriched category theory]] the functor category is generalized to the [[enriched functor category]].

In the absence of the [[axiom of choice]] (including many [[internal category|internal]] situations), the appropriate notion to use is the [[anafunctor category]].
