##Definition

There is some variation in the literature on what one calls a "[[quaternionic]] [[manifold]]''. The most general definition, however, encompassing all the others, is:

+-- {: .num_defn #QuaternionicManifold}
###### Definition
**(Quaternionic manifold)**

For $n \geq 2$, a **quaternionic manifold** is a real 4n-dimensional manifold M with a $\text{GL} (n,\mathbf{H})\cdot \mathbf{H} ^{\times }$-[[G-structure|structure]] which admits a [[torsion of a G-structure|torsion-free]] [[connection]] $\nabla$ (i.e. is integrable as a [[G-structure]]).

=--

When $\nabla$ does not exist $M$ is called _almost quaternionic_, and this is just a [[reduction of the structure group]] of $M$ along a [[Lie group]] inclusion $\text{GL}(n, \mathbf{H}) \hookrightarrow \text{GL}(4n, \mathbf{R})$. Note that the multiplicative group of the quaternions $\mathbf{H}^{\times}$ can be normalized, so that the second factor of $\text{GL} (n,\mathbf{H})\cdot \mathbf{H} ^{\times }$ is isomorphic to SU(2), or isomorphically again the first quaternionic unitary group Sp(1). Hence one occasionally finds the structure group reduction written $\text{GL} (n,\mathbf{H})\cdot \text{Sp}(1)$.

###### Remark


Other definitions have been given, based on the following useful but more naïve reasoning: consider two  [[almost complex structures]] on a smooth $4n$-manifold $M$, say $\langle M, I \rangle$ and $\langle M, J \rangle$, given the relation $\{ I, J \} =0$. Then call the structure $\langle M, I, J \rangle$ "almost quaternionic", and a map $\varphi:  \langle M, I, J \rangle \rightarrow \langle N, K, F \rangle$ of almost quaternionic structures "quaternionic" if it is separately [[complex analytic]] as a map $\langle M, I \rangle \rightarrow \langle N, K \rangle$ and also as a map $\langle M, J \rangle \rightarrow \langle N, F \rangle$.

When $\mathbf{R}^4$ is given a quaternionic multiplication with anti-commuting imaginary units $i$ and $j$, this is actually equivalent to $\varphi : \mathbf{R}^4 \rightarrow \mathbf{R}^4$ satisfying the [[Cauchy-Feuter]] complex:
$$ i \frac{\partial}{\partial u_3} = \frac{\partial }{\partial u _4}, j \frac{\partial }{ \partial u_2} = \frac{\partial }{\partial u_4}$$
$$i \frac{\partial}{\partial u_1} = \frac{\partial }{\partial u_2}, j \frac{\partial }{\partial u_1 } = \frac{\partial }{\partial u_3}$$
known as a starting point for defining a notion of "quaternionic [[holomorphy]]", since the Cauchy-Feuter complex consists of two separate [[Cauchy-Riemann]] systems in the imaginary units $i, j$. Such a complex exists on $\mathbf{R}^{4n}$ for any $n$ as an extended Cauchy-Fueter complex consisting of the systems above, repeated for each set of four coordinates. Hence, $\mathbf{R}^{4n}$ as a smooth manifold can always be endowed with an almost quaternionic structure. On this account of quaternionic structure, a _quaternionic $n$-manifold_ is then an almost quaternionic structure on a smooth manifold $M$ such that $M$ has an atlas of quaternionic maps, considered with respect to the standard quaternionic structure on $\mathbf{R}^{4n}$ just described. However, such a definition has serious drawbacks, such as the fact that quaternionic projective $n$-space $\mathbf{H}P^n := \text{Sp}(n + 1)/\text{Sp}(n)\text{Sp}(1)$ is not a "quaternionic manifold" in this sense for any $n$. It is, however, a quaternionic manifold under the official definition above.

## Examples

###### Example
**([[quaternion-Kähler manifolds]] are [[quaternionic manifolds]])**

By definition, a [[quaternion-Kähler manifold]] $M$ has [[holonomy group]] contained in the [[direct product group]] [[Sp(n)]]$\times$[[Spin(3)|Sp(1)]], admitting an extension of the [[Levi-Civita connection]] $\nabla$ on the holonomy bundle as torsion-free. Thus a quaternion-Kähler manifold is automatically quaternionic. 

Such extension $\nabla_\text{quat}$ of $\nabla$ however is not unique, since $\nabla_\text{quat} + \mathcal{S}$ is another Sp(n)Sp(1)-preserving connection, where $\mathcal{S}$ is a (1, 2)-tensor such that for every $p \in M$, $\mathcal{S}(p)$ takes values in the first [[prolongation]] of the [[Lie algebra]] for the [[G-structure]].
