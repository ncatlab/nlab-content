Expression __Euler form__ may mean either a [[differential form]] ("Chern-Euler form") representing the [[Euler characteristic class]], but also a $\mathbf{Z}$-bilinear form on a Grothendieck group of a $k$-linear abelian or triangulated category, related to an alternative sum of dimensions of Ext-groups. This entry is about the latter.
The terminology is allegedly due [[Claus Michael Ringel]]. 

## Definition 

If $C$ a $k$-linear [[abelian category]] such that $dim(Ext^i(M,N))\lt \infty$ for all $i$ and all objects $M,N$ in $C$, then the Euler form is a $\mathbf{Z}$-bilinear form $\langle -,-\rangle : K_0(C)\times K_0(C)\to\mathbf{Z}$ defined by
$$
\langle [M],[N]\rangle = \sum_{i\geq 0} (-1)^i dim(Ext^i(M,N)).
$$
