## Definition

In [[dependent type theory]], a **locally finite type** or a **locally $Fin$-small type** is a type $A$ such that for all elements $x:A$ and $y:A$, there is a natural number $n:\mathbb{N}$ and an [[equivalence of types]] between the [[identity type]] $x =_A y$ and the standard [[finite type]] $\mathrm{Fin}(n)$. 

##Â Properties

Since finite types are [[h-sets]], every locally finite type is an [[h-groupoid]], because its identity types are all h-sets.
