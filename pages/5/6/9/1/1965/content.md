_Les Derivateurs_ is a manuscript of some 2000 pages left behind by [[Alexander Grothendieck]] when he disappeared in 1991, dealing with the fundamentals of [[homotopy theory]]. It can be considered as a sequel to the more famous [[Pursuing Stacks]], but has a less conversational style.

 Portions have been LaTeXed and are available [here](http://people.math.jussieu.fr/~maltsin/groth/Derivateurs.html). More accessible are [Maltsiniotis' introductory notes](http://www.math.jussieu.fr/~maltsin/ps/m.ps) (Postscript).
