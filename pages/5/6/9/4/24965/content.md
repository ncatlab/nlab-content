## Idea

Reductionism is a philosophical position which states that all of that field should be based on a common foundation. This contrasts with [[pluralism]], which states that there are multiple equally valid approaches to a particular field. 

## Reductionism in the foundations of mathematics

In the context of the [[foundations of mathematics]], reductionism states that one should single out a single approach to the foundations of mathematics as the universal approach to the foundations of mathematics. The mathematical status quo regards the [[material set theory]] of [[ZFC]] as the single reductionist approach to the foundations of mathematcs. Some category theorists take the [[categorical set theory]] of [[ETCS]] as the single reductionist approach to the foundations of mathematcs.
