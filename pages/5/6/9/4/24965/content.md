## Idea

Reductionism is a philosophical position which states that all of that field can be reduced to a common foundation. 

This contrasts with [[emergentism]], which says that the entire field cannot be reduced to a common foundation. 

Note that this is different from the [[pluralism]]/[[monism]] distinction: monist reductionists believe there is only one way to reduce a field down to a common foundation, while pluralist reductionists would believe that there are multiple ways to reduce a field down to a common foundation. 

## Reductionism in the foundations of mathematics

Reductionism is inherent in the foundations of mathematics, because it posits that everything in mathematics can be reduced down to the foundations of mathematics.
