A __simply connected topological space__ is a [[n-connected space|1-connected]] [[topological space]] $X$: a [[connected space]] whose [[fundamental group]] is the [[trivial group]]:

$\pi_1(X) = \{e\}$.

Equivalently: if it is a [[simply connected object]] of the [[(∞,1)-topos]] [[Top]].

See [[n-connected object of an (infinity,1)-topos]] for more.
