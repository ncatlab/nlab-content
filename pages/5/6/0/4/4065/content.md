## Idea

The ("Monstrous") __Moonshine__ [[vertex operator algebra]] is a curious example of VOA related to the *[[Monster]]* simple [[finite group]]. 

+-- {: .standout}
Well, Moonshine usually refers to the mysterious connections between the Monster simple group and the modular function j. There were a bunch of conjectures about this connection that were proved by Borcherds, en passant mentioning the existence of the Moonshine Vertex Algebra (constructed then later by FLM). Nowadays there is also Moonshine for other simple groups, by the work of J. Duncan. So I think there shoould be an entry for the general moonshine phenomenon, and then a link to the Moonshine Vertex algebra.
