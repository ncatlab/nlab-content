## Definition

A __simple Lie algebra__ is a [[Lie algebra]] $L$ such that:

*  $L$ is not [[abelian Lie algebra|abelian]], and
*  the only [[proper ideal]] of $L$ is the zero ideal.

Equivalently, a simple Lie algebra is a [[simple object]] of [[LieAlg]] that *also* is nonabelian.


## Semisimple Lie algebras

A __[[semisimple Lie algebra]]__ is a [[direct sum]] of simple Lie algebras.
