## Idea
A __stochastic process__ describes a dynamical system evolving over a [[linearly ordered set]] $T$ ("time", typically the integers or positive real axis) whose dynamical laws are morphisms in the Kleisi category of the [[Giry monad]] (or any other probability monad). By working in the larger category of algebras of that monad, a characterization  of a stochastic processes can be modeled in terms of the expected value of measurements on that process. 

By a __random process__ physicists usually mean the same, but mathematicians sometimes allow random processes indexed by more general sets, not usually with meaning of time or equipped with a linear order. 

The most studied examples include [[Brownian motion]], [[Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process]] and [[Lévy process]]es. The concept of an __indivisible stochastic process__ leads to [[Jacob Barandes]] [[indivisible stochastic process interpretation of quantum mechanics]].
