## Idea

A __stochastic process__ is a function from a [[linearly ordered set]] $T$ ("time", typically the integers or positive real axis) into a set of [[random variable]]s (on fixed [[probability space]]), that is a collection $(X_t)_{t\in T}$ of random variables.

By a __random process__ physicists usually mean the same, but mathematicians sometimes allow random processes indexed by more general sets, not usually with meaning of time or equipped with a linear order; maybe "random collection" would be a better term in that case. 

The most studied examples include [[Brownian motion]], [[Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process]] and [[Lévy process]]es.
