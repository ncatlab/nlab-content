For $Core(C) \hookrightarrow W \hookrightarrow C$ a [[category with weak equivalences]], and for $F : C \to D$ any functor, the left (right) _derived functor_ of $F$ is the left (right) [[Kan extension]] of $F$ along the projection $p : C \to Ho_C$ to the [[homotopy category]]

$$
 \array{
   C &&\stackrel{F}{\to}&& D
   \\
   \downarrow^p &\Downarrow& \nearrow_{L F}
   \\
   Ho_C
 }
$$

(maybe I have left/right mixed up).
