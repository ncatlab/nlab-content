## Idea

The [[canonical model structure]] on the 1-[[category]] [[Grpd]] of [[groupoids]] (with [[functors]] between them) is a presentation of the [[(2,1)-category]] of [[groupoids]], [[functors]] and [[natural isomorphisms]].

This is one flavor of the various [[canonical model structures]] on classes of [[categories]] and [[higher categories]].

## Definition


\begin{definition}
\label{TheDefinition}
Let [[Grpd]] be the 1-[[category]] of [[small category|small]] [[groupoids]] with [[functors]] between them. Say that a morphism in $Grpd$ --- a [[functor]] $f \colon C \longrightarrow D$ --- is: 

* a _[[weak equivalence]]_ iff it is an [[equivalence of categories]] hence a [[weak homotopy equivalence]] of groupoids,

* a _[[fibration]]_ iff it is an [[isofibration]],

* a _[[cofibration]]_ iff it is an [[isocofibration]], hence  [[injective-on-objects functor|injective on objects]].

\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
\label{ExistenceAndBasicProperties}

Equipped with the classes from Def. \ref{TheDefinition} [[Grpd]] is a [[model category]] $Grpd_{can}$, which is

* [[combinatorial model category|combinatorial]] 

  (in particular [[cofibrantly generated model category|cofibrantly generated]]),

* [[proper model category|proper]],

* [[simplicial model category|simplicial]] 

  (induced under the [[simplicial nerve]] by the canonical enrichment over itself),

* [[cartesian monoidal model category|cartesian monoidal]].

\end{proposition}
The claim that the classes in Def. \ref{TheDefinition} indeed give a model structure is due to [Anderson 1978](#Anderson78), repeated by [Bousfield 1989](#Bousfield89), both without proof. Proofs appear in [Joyal & Tierney 1991, Thm. 2](#JoyalTierney91) (there in the generality of [[groupoids internal to]] [[topoi]], hence: of [[stacks]]) and [Strickland 2000](#Strickland00), who also observes and proves [[right proper model category|right properness]] (left properness is immediate because all objects are [[cofibrant object|cofibrant]]). In the context of the [[model structure for (2,1)-sheaves]] the structure  is considered, [Hollander 2001, theorem 2.1](#Hollander01) who states also the [[cofibrantly generated model category|cofibrant generation]] and [[simplicial model category|simplicial enrichment]], without proof. 
Since [[Grpd]] is a [[locally presentable category]] (for instance by [this Prop](sketch#LimitSketchableCategoriesAreLocallyPresentable), observing that groupoids are the models of a [[limit sketch]], namely given by diagrams as shown at *[[internal category]]*) this implies that $Grpd_{can}$ is [[combinatorial model category|combinatorial]].
Finally regarding the [[cartesian monoidal model category|cartesian model structure]]: the [unit axiom](monoidal+model+category#UnitAxiom) is immediate since all objects are cofibrant (hence in particular the Cartesian tensor unit, which is the [[terminal groupoid]]), while the [pushout-product axioms](monoidal+model+category#PushoutProductAxiom) follows as in 
[Sharma 2023, Thm. 2.24](#Sharma23) (in the preprint, which is Thm. 2.26 in the published version, in either case stated there for the groupoid-localization of the [[canonical model structure on Cat]], but the argument immediately applies here).

## Properties

### Relation to canonical model structure on $Cat$

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

The model structure $Grpd_{nat}$ is the restriction of the
[[canonical model structure on Cat]] from [[categories]] to groupoids.

See at *[[canonical model structure]]* for more.


### Relation to classical model structure on $sSet$

Consider the pair of [[adjoint functors]]
\[
  \label{NerveAdjunction}
  (\tau \dashv N) 
  \,\colon\, 
  Grpd 
    \underoverset
      { \underset{N}{\longrightarrow} }
      { \overset{\tau}{\longleftarrow} }
      { \bot }
  sSet
\]
where $N$ is the [[simplicial nerve]] with values in the category [[sSet]] of [[simplicial sets]].

One readily checks that: 

\begin{proposition}
With the canonical model structure on $Grpd$ (from Prop. \ref{ExistenceAndBasicProperties}) and the [[classical model structure on simplicial sets]], (eq:)NerveAdjunction is a [[Quillen adjunction]]
$$
  (\tau \dashv N) 
  \,\colon\, 
  Grpd_{can} 
    \underoverset
      { \underset{N}{\longrightarrow} }
      { \overset{\tau}{\longleftarrow} }
      { \bot_{\mathrlap{Qu}} }
  sSet_{Qu}
  \,.
$$
\end{proposition}
(cf. [Hollander 2001, Cor. 2.3](#Hollander01))

In fact:
\begin{proposition}
$Grpd_{can}$ is the [[transferred model structure]] obtained from [[classical model structure on simplicial sets|$sSet_{Qu}$]] under (eq:NerveAdjunction).
\end{proposition}
(cf. [Hollander 2001, Lem. 2.4](#Hollander01))
