Information geometry aims to apply the techniques of [[differential geometry]] to statistics. Often it is useful to think of a family of probability distributions as a _statistical_ [[manifold]]. For example, normal distributions form a 2-dimensional manifold, parameterised by $(\mu, \sigma)$, mean and standard deviation. On such manifolds there are notions of [[Riemannian metric]], [[connection]], [[curvature]], and so on, of statistical relevance.
