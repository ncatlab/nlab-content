If a group $G$ acts on a groupoid $\Gamma$ then there is an _orbit groupoid_ $\Gamma /\! / G$ which is a groupoid with trivial $G$-action and with a $G$-morphism $\Gamma \to \Gamma /\! / G$ universal for $G$-morphisms to groupoids with trivial $G$-action. So in principle   $\Gamma /\! / G$ is obtained from $\Gamma$ by identifying  $g.\gamma$ and $\gamma$  for all $g \in G$, $\gamma \in \Gamma$. 

Note that if a group $G$ acts on a space $X$ then it has an induced action on the fundamental groupoid $\pi_1 X$, and so there is an induced morphism 

$$\alpha: \pi_1 X /\! / G \to \pi_1 (X/G). $$

So there is interest in when this morphism is an isomorphism. 

## THEOREM## 

_$\alpha$ is an isomorphism if $X$ is Hausdorff, has a universal cover, and the action of $G$ on $X$ is discontinuous. _

This allows some calculation of the fundamental groups of orbit spaces.
