If a [[group]] $G$ [[action|acts]] on a [[groupoid]] $\Gamma$, then there is an _orbit groupoid_ $\Gamma /\! / G$ which is a groupoid with trivial $G$-action and with a $G$-morphism $\Gamma \to \Gamma /\! / G$ universal for $G$-morphisms to groupoids with trivial $G$-action. So in principle   $\Gamma /\! / G$ is obtained from $\Gamma$ by identifying  $g.\gamma$ and $\gamma$  for all $g \in G$, $\gamma \in \Gamma$. 

Note that if a group $G$ acts on a space $X$ then it has an induced action on the [[fundamental groupoid]] $\Pi_1 X$, and so there is an induced morphism 

$$\alpha: \Pi_1 X /\! / G \to \Pi_1 (X/G). $$

So there is interest in when this morphism is an isomorphism. 

+--{: .un_theorem}
$\alpha$ is an isomorphism if $X$ is Hausdorff, has a universal cover, and the action of $G$ on $X$ is discontinuous.

This allows some calculation of the [[fundamental group]]s of [[orbit space]]s.
