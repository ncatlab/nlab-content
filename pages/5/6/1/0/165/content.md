#Idea#

The **fundamental [[groupoid]]** $\Pi_1(X)$ of a topological space has as objects the pojnts of $X$ and as morphism between points $x$ and $y$ the _homotopy_ classes of continuous paths in $X$ from $x$ to $y$. Composition is by concatenation of representative paths.

#Remarks#

* For any $x$ in $X$ the first homotopy group $\pi_1(X,x)$ of $X$ based at $X$ arises as the automorphisms in $\Pi_1(X)$ at $x$:
$$
  \pi_1(X,x) = Aut_{\Pi_1(X)}(x)
  \,.
$$
So the fundamental groupoid is an improvement of the idea of the fundamental group, which gets rid of the choice of basepoint.

* In parts of the literature the fundamental groupoid and in particular the [[fundamental infinity-groupoid]] of a space is called the **Poincar&#233;-groupoid**.
