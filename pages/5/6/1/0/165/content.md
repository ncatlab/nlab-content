## Idea

The **fundamental groupoid** of a space $X$ is a [[groupoid]] whose objects are the points of $X$ and whose morphisms are [[paths]] in $X$, identified up to endpoint-preserving [[homotopy]].

In parts of the literature the fundamental groupoid, and more generally the [[fundamental ∞-groupoid]], is called the **Poincar&#233; groupoid**.


## Definition

The **fundamental groupoid** $\Pi_1(X)$ of a topological space $X$ is the [[groupoid]] whose set of objects is $X$ and whose morphisms from $x$ to $y$ are the equivalence classes of continuous maps $\gamma : [0,1] \to X$ whose endpoints map to $x$ and $y$; two such paths are considered equivalent if there exists a homotopy between them which keeps the endpoints fixed. Composition is by concatenation (and reparametrization) of representative maps. Under the [[homotopy]]-[[equivalence relation]] this becomes an associative and unital composition with respect to which every morphism has an inverse; hence $\Pi_1(X)$ is a groupoid.


## Remarks

### Relationship to fundamental group

For any $x$ in $X$ the first homotopy group $\pi_1(X,x)$ of $X$ based at $x$ arises as the [[automorphism group]] of $x$ in $\Pi_1(X)$:
$$
  \pi_1(X,x) = Aut_{\Pi_1(X)}(x)
  \,.
$$
So the fundamental groupoid gets rid of the choice of basepoint for the fundamental group, and this is valuable for some applications. The set of connected components of $\Pi_1(X)$ is precisely the set $\Pi_0(X)$ of path-components of $X$.  (This is not to be confused with the set of connected components of $X$, sometimes denoted by the same symbol.  Of course they are the same when $X$ is locally path-connected.)


### Topologizing the fundamental groupoid

The fundamental groupoid $\Pi_1(X)$ can be made into a [[topological groupoid]] (i.e. a [[internal groupoid|groupoid internal]] to [[Top]]) when $X$ is [[path-connected space|path-connected]], [[locally path-connected space|locally path-connected]] and [[semi-locally simply connected space|semi-locally simply connected]]. This is a special case of ([Brown 06, 10.5.8](#Browno6)). 
This construction is closely linked with the construction of a [[universal covering space]] for a path-connected pointed space. The object space of this groupoid is just the space $X$.


When $X$ is not semi-locally simply connected, the set of arrows of the fundamental groupoid inherits the [[quotient space|quotient topology]] from the path space such that the fibres of $(s,t):Mor(\Pi_1(X)) \to X\times X$ are not discrete, which is an obstruction to the above-mentioned source fibre\'s being a covering space. However the composition is no longer continuous. When $X$ is not locally path-connected, $\Pi_0(X)$ also inherits a non-discrete topology (the quotient topology of $X$ by the relation of path connections).

In circumstances like these more sophisticated methods are appropriate, such as [[shape theory]].  This is also related to the [[fundamental group of a topos]], which is in general a [[progroup]] or a [[localic group]] rather than an ordinary group.


### $\Pi_1(X)$ with a chosen set of basepoints

An improvement on the fundamental group and the total fundamental groupoid  relevant to the [[van Kampen theorem]] for computing the fundamental group or groupoid is to use $\Pi_1(X,A)$, defined for a set $A$ to be the full subgroupoid of $\Pi_1(X)$ on the set $A\cap X$, thus giving a set  of base points which can be  chosen according to the geometry at hand. Thus if $X$ is the union of two open sets $U,V$ with intersection $W$ then we can take $A$ large enough to meet each path-component of $U,V,W$; note that by the above definition we can write $\Pi_1(U,A)$, etc.  If $X$ has an action of a group $G$ then $G$ acts on $\Pi_1(X,A)$ if $A$ is a union of orbits of the action. Thus $\Pi_1(X,A)$ can represent some symmetry of a given situation. 

 The notion of $\Pi_1(X,A)$ was introduced in 1967 by [[Ronnie Brown]]  to give a version of the Seifert-van Kampen Theorem which allowed the determination  of the fundamental group of a connected space which is the union of connected subspaces with nonconnected intersection, such as the  circle, a space  which is, after all, THE basic example in topology.

Grothendieck writes in his 1984 [[Esquisse d'un programme]] (English translation):

"..., people still obstinately persist,  when calculating with fundamental groups, in fixing a single base point, instead of cleverly choosing a whole packet of points which is invariant under  the symmetries of the situation, which thus get lost on the way.  In certain situations (such as descent theorems for fundamental groups à la van  Kampen) it is much more elegant,  even indispensable for understanding  something, to work with fundamental groupoids with respect to a suitable packet of base points, ..." 

Notice that $\Pi_1(X,X)$ recovers the full fundamental groupoid, while $\Pi_1(X,\{x\})$ is simply  the [[fundamental group]] $\pi_1(X,x)$. 

 Basically, $\Pi_1(X,A)$  allows for the _computation of homotopy 1-types_; the theory was developed in  _Elements of Modern Topology_ (1968), now available as _Topology and Groupoids_ (2006). These accounts show  the use of the algebra of  groupoids in 1-dimensional  [[homotopy theory]], for example for [[covering space]]s,  and, in the later edition,  for [[orbit spaces]]. spring

### Fundamental groupoid and monodromy principle

The use of the fundamental groupoid of a manifold for describing the monodromy principle on the extension of local morphisms is discussed in the paper by Brown/Mucuk listed below.
