## Idea

A _virtual representation_ of a [[group]] is a formal difference with respect to [[direct sum]] of two ordinary [[representations]], hence the [[isomorphism class]] of a virtual representation is an element of the [[Grothendieck group]] of $(G Rep, \oplus)$. Equivalence classes of virtual representations form the elements of the [[representation ring]] of the group, see there for more.

If we regard an ordinary [[representation]] as an [[equivariant vector bundle]] over the point, then a virtual representation is a corresponding equivariant [[virtual vector bundle]]. Accordingly the [[representation ring]] of a [[finite group]] is its [[equivariant K-theory]] of the point.
