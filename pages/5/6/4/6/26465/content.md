## Definition

A **trichotomous relation** on a set $S$ is a [[relation]] $R(x, y)$ which satisfies **trichotomy**: 

* for all $x \in S$ and $y \in S$, exactly one of $R(x, y)$, $R(y, x)$, $x = y$ is true. 

## Examples

* In [[classical mathematics]], the **law of trichotomy** or **axiom of trichotomy** for the [[real numbers]] state that the [[strict total order]] on the real numbers is trichotomous. In [[constructive mathematics]], this statement is equivalent to the [[analytic LPO]].

* In [[classical mathematics]], every [[strict total order]] is a trichotomous relation, and strict total orders can be defined as a [[transitive relation|transitive]] trichotomous relation. However, in constructive mathematics, only the decidable strict total orders are trichotomous relations.
