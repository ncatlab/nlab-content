## Definition

Given vector subspaces $V_0$ and $V_1$ of a [[vector space]] $V$, we write $V_0\prec V_1$ if $V_0/(V_0\cap V_1)$ is finite-dimensional.
We write $V_0\sim V_1$ and say $V_0$ and $V_1$ are __commensurable__ if $V_0\prec V_1$ and $V_1\prec V_0$.

A __Tate vector space__ is a complete Hausdorff [[topological vector space]] $V$ that admits a basis of neighborhoods of 0 whose elements are mutually commensurable vector subspaces of $V$.

## Duality

A vector subspace $W$ of a Tate vector space $V$ is __bounded__ if for every open vector subspace $U\subset V$ we have $W\prec U$.

The __dual__ of a Tate vector space $V$ is $Hom(V,\mathbf{C})$ equipped with a topology generated by the basis of neighborhoods of 0 whose elements are orthogonal complements to bounded subspaces of $V$.

## Properties

Tate vector spaces form an [[pre-abelian category]].
