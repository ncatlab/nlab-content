* For the notion of reflection of [[waves]] at an interface between two different mediums, see *[[reflection of waves]]*.

* For the notion of reflection for a [[function]] $f$ in [[number theory]], [[real analysis]], [[functional analysis]], see *[[reflection relation]]*.

* For the notions of reflection in [[category theory]], see *[[reflection along a functor]], *[[reflective subcategory]]* and *[[idempotent monad]]*.

* For the notion of reflection in [[modal logic]] and [[modal type theory]], see *[[modal operator]]*, *[[reflective subuniverse]]*.
