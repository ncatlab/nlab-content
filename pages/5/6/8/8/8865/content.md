## Idea

A _differential algebra_ is an [[associative algebra]] $A$ equipped with a [[derivation]] $d \colon A \to A$, typically required to satisfy $d \circ d = 0$.

If $A$ is a [[field]] one accordingly speaks of a _differential field_.

If $A$ is a [[graded algebra]] and $d$ is of degree 1 one speaks of a _[[differential graded algebra]]_. 

Etc.
