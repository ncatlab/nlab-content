## Definition

A [[filtered space]] $X_*$ is called a **connected filtered space** if it satisfies:  

1. $(\phi)_0$: The function $\pi_0X_0  \to \pi_0X_r$ induced by   inclusion is surjective for all $r \gt 0$; and, 

1. for all $i \geq 1$, $(\phi_i): \pi_i(X_r,X_i,v)=0$  for all $r \gt i$  and $ v \in  X_0$.


Another equivalent form is:

1. $(\phi_0')$: The function $\pi_0X_s  \to \pi_0X_r$ induced by   inclusion is surjective for all $0=s \lt r$ and bijective for all $1 \leq s \leq   r$; and,

1. for all $i \geq 1$, $(\phi_i'): \, \pi_j(X_r,X_i,v)=0$  for all  $v \in X_0$ and all $ j,r$ such that $ 1 \leq j \leq i \lt r$.
