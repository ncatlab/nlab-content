## Definition

For $p$ a [[prime number]], a [[group]] is _$p$-primary_ if each of its elements $g$ has [[order of a group|order]] a power $p^{n(g)}$ of the given prime.

(Also called _primary group_ a _$p$-group_, but NO relation to _[[n-group]]_.)

## Properties

### Relation to finite abelian group

Every [[finite abelian group]] is a [[direct sum]] of its $p$-primary subgroups.

## Examples

* for the primary components of the [[stable homotopy groups of spheres]] see at _[homotopy groups of spheres -- Table](homotopy+groups+of+spheres#Tables)_.
