## Idea and definition

An affine morphism of schemes is a relative version of the [[affine scheme]]: given a scheme $X$, the canonical morphism $X\to Spec \mathbb{Z}$ is affine iff $X$ is an affine scheme. By the basics of spectra, every morphism of affine schemes $Spec S\to Spec R$ corresponds to a morphism $f^\circ : R\to S$ of rings. The affine morphism of general schemes is defined as the one which is locally of that form: 

* a morphism $f:X\to Y$ of (general) schemes is **affine** if there is a cover of $Y$ (as a ringed space) by affines $U_\alpha$ such that $f^{-1} U_\alpha$ is an affine subscheme of $X$. 

A seemingly stronger, but in fact equivalent, characterization follows: $f:X\to Y$ is affine iff for every affine $U\subset Y$, the inverse image $f^{-1}(U)$ is affine.
