## Idea 

For various classical types of algebras, like associative, Lie, Leibniz, commutative and so on, one can form version where the required identities hold up to homotopy. The most important modification is that the required identities hold up to coherent homotopy; such were traditionally called strong homotopy algebras. If $P$ is an operad in some homotopical context than to obtain homotopy generalization of $P$-algebras, one needs to resolve the operad $P$ to an appropropriate replacement $P_\infty$ which is minimal or cofibrant in certain sense. 

## Terminology in the case of dg-operads

The classical case is in the setup of dg-operad. 
Thus one had __strong homotopy associative__ algebras which are the same as $A_\infty$-algebras, __strong homotopy commutative__ (associative) algebras which also called $C_\infty$-algebras, __strong homotopy bialgebras__ or $B_\infty$-algebras, __strong homotopy Gerstenhaber__ or $G_\infty$-algebras and __strong homotopy Lie algebras__ or $L_\infty$-algebras and (strong) [[homotopy BV-algebra]]s or $BV_\infty$-algebras.
