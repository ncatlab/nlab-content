## Idea

Generally, an __inductive limit__ is the same thing as a [[colimit]].  (Similarly, a [[projective limit]] is the same thing as a [[limit]].)  In this context, an __inductive system__ is the same thing as a [[diagram]], and an __inductive cone__ is the same thing as a [[cocone]].

However, many authors restrict this terminology to colimits over [[directed sets]] (or [[filtered categories]]), especially the directed set $(\mathbb{N},\leq)$ of [[natural numbers]]; see [[directed colimit]] (or [[filtered colimit]]) for discussion of this case if you think that it may be what you want.

The dual concept is that of a _[[projective limit]]_.
