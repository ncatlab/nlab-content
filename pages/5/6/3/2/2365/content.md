"Inductive limit" is another name for what here is simply called [[limit]].  (Similarly, "[[projective limit]]" is another term for what here is called [[colimit]].)

Many authors restrict this term to limits over downward-[[directed sets]], especially the directed set $(\mathbb{N},\geq)$ of [[natural numbers]]; see [[directed limit]] for discussion of this case if you think that it may be what you want.
