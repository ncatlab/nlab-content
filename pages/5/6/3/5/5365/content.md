## Idea

A _cell complex_ is an [[object]] in a [[category]] which is obtained by successively "gluing cells" via [[pushouts]].

## Definition

Let $C$ be a [[category]] with [[colimits]] and equipped with a [[set]] $\mathcal{I} \subset Mor(C)$ of [[morphisms]], to be called the *generating cofibrations*.

In practice, $C$ is usually a [[cofibrantly generated model category]] with set $\mathcal{I}$ of [[generating cofibrations]] and set $\mathcal{J}$ of [[generating acyclic cofibrations]]. 

Now: 

\begin{definition}\label{TheAbstractDefinition}

An _$\mathcal{I}$-cell complex_ in $C$ is an [[object]] $X$ which is connected to the [[initial object]] $\emptyset \to X$  by a [[transfinite composition]] of [[pushouts]] ([[cell attachments]]) of ([[coproducts]] of) the generating cofibrations in $\mathcal{I}$.

More generally, a _relative $\mathcal{I}$-cell complex_ (relative to any object $A$) is any morphism $A \to X$ obtained like this starting from $A$.

A _finite cell complex_ or _countable cell complex_ is a cell complex with a [[finite set]] or a [[countable set]] of cells, respectively.

\end{definition}

\begin{remark}\label{OnTheAppearanceOfCoproducts}
  Definition \ref{TheAbstractDefinition} is often stated without explicitly allowing forming [[coproducts]] of generating cofibrations (formed in the [[arrow category]]) before taking their [[pushouts]] (e.g. [Hovey 1999 Def. 2.1.9](#Hovey99) and [Hirschhorn 2002 Def. 10.5.8](#Hirschhorn02)) while in practice authors often do consider this (e.g. [Hirschhorn 2015 Rem. 4.4](#Hirschhorn15)).

The two variants are equivalent assuming the [[axiom of choice]] in the form of the [[well-ordering theorem]]: With that theorem/assumption, the set of [[coproducts]] to be pushed out may be equipped with a [[well-order]] and with that the pushout of the coproduct is equivalently the transfinite composition of pushouts of summands of the coproduct in that order.

(Note that the [[axiom of choice]] is used already for basic statements in this context, like the very existence of the [[classical model structure on topological spaces]], see there [this Lemma](classical+model+structure+on+topological+spaces#CompactSubsetsAreSmallInCellComplexes)).

\end{remark}


## Examples

* A [[CW-complex]] is a cell complex in [[Top]] with respect to the generating cofibrations in the standard [[model structure on topological spaces]].

* Every [[simplicial set]] is a cell complex with respect to the generating cofibrations in the standard [[model structure on simplicial sets]].

* A [[Sullivan model]] is a cell complex with respect to the generating cofibrations in the standard [[model structure on dg-algebras]].

* A [[cell spectrum]] is a cell complex in the category of topological [[sequential spectra]].
