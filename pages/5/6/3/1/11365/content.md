## Definition

The _projective linear group_ $PGL(n)$ (in some [[dimension]] $n$ and over some [[coefficients]]) is the [[quotient]] of the [[general linear group]] $GL(n)$ by its [[center of a group|center]].

## Examples

* $PGL(2)$ has a canonical [[action]] on the [[upper half plane]] and as such is equivalent to the [[modular group]] of [[MÃ¶bius transformations]]

## Related concepts

* [[projective space]]

* [[projective unitary group]]

* [[special linear group]]

* [[Fuchsian group]]
