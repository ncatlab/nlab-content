## Definition

The _projective general linear group_ $PGL(n)$ (in some [[dimension]] $n$ and over some [[coefficients]]) is the [[quotient]] of the [[general linear group]] $GL(n)$ by its [[center of a group|center]].

Elements of $PGL(n)$ are identified with the  automorphisms of the projective space of lines in the original vector space where $GL(n)$ is acting, hence they amount to [[projective transformation]]s of the projective space. 

## Examples

* $PGL(2)$ has a canonical [[action]] on the [[upper half plane]] and as such is equivalent to the [[modular group]] of [[MÃ¶bius transformations]]
