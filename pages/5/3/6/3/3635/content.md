* [[Tim Porter]], _The Crossed Menagerie: an introduction to crossed gadgetry and cohomology in algebra and topology_. (Notes, in part, prepared for the  _XVI Encuentro Rioplatense de Algebra y Geometr&#237;a Algebraica_, in Buenos Aires, 12-15 December 2006, and for course MATH5312, Spring-Summer term 2007, 
University of Ottawa) ([[menagerie14.pdf|pdf:file]])

This is an ongoing set of notes outlining an approach to [[nonabelian cohomology]], [[stack]]s, etc., and Grothendieck's conjectured extension of 'Galois-Poincar&#233; theory'. The title refers to the array of strange beasties that occur as generalisations of [[crossed modules]]. (The present version is over 1004 pages long, and is changing quite often. A fairly stable version (but up-dates are planned shortly!) is available as a download,  [[menagerie12a.pdf|here:file]].

These notes, or at least the first few chapters of them, acted as course notes for a 4 lecture course in Buenos Aires, and later on for a course on cohomology in Ottawa. 

  Some idea of the content can be gleaned from the Table of Contents.

(This gives an indication of the Chapter and section headings, although these have changed in detail for the latest version available. Subsection headings give too long a list to be that useful, so if you want more detail (for the moment) look at the pdf file.)
