###### Definition

**Segal's category**, denoted $\Gamma$ is the category opposite to the [[skeleton]] of the [[category]] $FinSet^{*/}$ of [[pointed object|pointed]] [[finite sets]]: 

$$
  \Gamma^{op} \simeq FinSet^{*/}
  \,.
$$

###### Remark

The category $\Gamma$ is related to [[(infinity,1)-operads]] in a way similar to how the [[simplex category]] (non-empty and _linearly ordered_  finite sets) is related to [[(∞,1)-categories]].

###### Remark

A morphism $f \colon \{*\} \coprod S \to \{*\} \coprod T$ in $\Gamma$ may be thought of as a [[partially defined function]] $\tilde f \colon S \to T$ which is undefined on all elements of $S$ that $f$ sends to the point.
