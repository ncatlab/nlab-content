## Properties

### Hydrogen line

It has been argued ([Higan-Rees 79](#HiganRees79)) that observation of a absorption at the 21cm [[hydrogen line]] in the cosmic microwave background would be a signal from the time when the first [[stars]] formed and ignited, a cosmological epoch not otherwise accessible to observation. A claim of detection of this signal by the [[EDGES]] [[experiment]] appeared in [BRMMM 18](#BRMMM18).
