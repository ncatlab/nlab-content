> With the recent result $[$of [[LHCb]]$]$, for the first time a single observable affected by negligible theoretical uncertainties exhibits a deviation from the SM exceeding the $3 \sigma$ level.  Equally striking is the overall coherence of the picture that emerges, especially in $b \to s \ell^+ \ell^-$ −transitions.  As we shall show in this paper, combining all the $b \to s \ell^+ \ell^-$−observables in a very conservative way, the significance of the New Physics (NP) hypothesis formulated in 2014–2015 of a purely left-handed LFU-violating contact interaction has now reached a [[statistical significance|significance]] of $4.6 \sigma$.
