## Definition

### In finite dimensions

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ a [[natural number]],  the **unitary group** $U(n)$ is the [[group]] of [[isometry|isometries]] of the $n$-dimensional complex [[Hilbert space]] $\mathbb{C}^n$.   This is canonically identified with the group of $n \times n$ unitary [[matrices]].

### In infinite dimensions

More generally, for $\mathcal{H}$ any Hilbert space, $U(\mathcal{H})$ is the group of [[unitary operator]]s on that Hilbert space.



The unitary groups are naturally [[topological group]]s and [[Lie group]]s (infinite dimensional of $\mathcal{H}$) is infinite dimensional.

Write $B U(n)$ for the [[classifying space]] of the [[topological group]] $U(n)$. Inclusion of matrices into larger matrices gives a canonical sequence of inclusions

$$
  \cdots \to B U(n) \hookrightarrow B U(n+1) \hookrightarrow B U(n+2) \to \cdots
  \,.
$$

The [[homotopy limit|homotopy]] [[direct limit]] over this is written

$$
  B U := {\lim_\to}_n B U(n)
$$

or sometimes $B U(\infty)$. Notice that this is very different from $B U(\mathcal{H})$ for $\mathcal{H}$ an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. See [[topological K-theory]] for more on this.


## Examples

For instance $U(1)$ is the [[circle group]].

## Properties

For $\mathcal{H}$ a separable infinite-dimensional [[Hilbert space]], $U(\mathcal{H})$ is [[contractible]].



## Related concepts

The subgroup of unitary matrices with [[determinant]] equal to 1 is the [[special unitary group]]. The [[quotient]] by the [[center]] is the [[projective unitary group]].


The analog of the unitary group for real metric spaces is the [[orthogonal group]].
