## Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ a [[natural number]],  the **unitary group** $U(n)$ is the [[group]] of [[isometry|isometries]] of the $n$-dimensional complex [[Hilbert space]] $\mathbb{C}^n$.   This is canonically identified with the group of $n \times n$ unitary [[matrices]].


More generally, for $\mathcal{H}$ any Hilbert space, $U(\mathcal{H})$ is the group of [[unitary operator]]s on that Hilbert space.


## Examples

For instance $U(1)$ is the [[circle group]].

## Related concepts

The subgroup of unitary matrices with [[determinant]] equal to 1 is the [[special unitary group]].
The analog of the unitary group for real metric spaces is the [[orthogonal group]].
