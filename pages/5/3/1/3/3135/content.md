For $n \in \mathbb{N}$,  the **unitary group** $U(n)$ is the [[group]] of [[isometry|isometries]] of an $n$-dimensional complex [[Hilbert space]]. 

This is canonically identified with the group of $n \times n$ unitary matrices.


More generally, for $\mathcal{H}$ any Hilbert space, $U(\mathcal{H})$ is the group of [[unitary operator]]s on that Hilbert space.


The analog of the unitary group for real metric spaces is the [[orthogonal group]].
