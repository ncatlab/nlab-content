For $n \in \mathbb{N}$,  the **unitary group** $U(n)$ is the [[group]] of [[isometry|isometries]] of an $n$-dimensional complex [[Hilbert space]]. 

This is canonically identified with the group of $n \times n$ unitary matrices.

The analog of the unitary group for real metric spaces is the [[orthogonal group]].
