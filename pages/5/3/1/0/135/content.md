$Diff$ is the [[category]] whose [[object|objects]] are smooth [[manifolds]] based on [[cartesian spaces]] and whose [[morphism|morphisms]] are [[smooth map|smooth maps]] between them.

For some purposes, $Diff$ should be replaced with a category of [[generalized smooth space|generalized smooth spaces]].
