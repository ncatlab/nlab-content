#Idea#

A _scheme_ is a locally [[ringed space]] that _locally_ looks like a particularly simple [[ringed space]]: an [[affine scheme]].

The notion of scheme originates in [[algebraic geometry]] where it is, since [[Grothendieck]]'s revolution of that subject, a central notion. For that reason the "particularly nice ringed spaces" that a scheme is required to be locally isomorphic to are taken to be [[spectrum (geometry)|spectra]] of commutative [[ring]]s.

However, the idea that

A scheme is a ringed space that is locally isomorphic to an affine space.

is much more general and need not be restricted to a notion of affine spaces that are [[duality|formal duals]] of rings.

For instance a smooth [[manifold]] is a ringed space that is locally isomorphic to a "smooth affine space" $\mathbb{R}^n$, with its standard smooth structure.

The standard concept of scheme in [[algebraic geometry]] is therefore usefully understood as a special case of [[generalized scheme]]s that naturally appear for instance also in [[differential geometry]], in [[synthetic differential geometry]] and many other topics.

# Definition #

## as locally ringed spaces ##

A __scheme__ is a locally [[ringed space]] $(X, \mathcal{O}_X)$ with an open cover (as locally ringed spaxces), by [[affine scheme]]s: the spectra $Spec A = (|Spec A|, \mathcal{O}_{Spec A})$ of unital commutative [[ring]]s.

A morphism $f : X \to Y$ of schemes is a morphism of the underlying [[ringed space]]s, such that for each point $x \in X$ the induced map of [[local ring]]s

$$
  (\mathcal{O}_Y)_{f(x)} \to  (\mathcal{O}_X)_x
$$

is _local_ (in that it carries the maximal ideal to the maximal ideal).

## as sheaves on $CRing^{op}$ ##

There is a fully faithful functor from schemes to the category of [[presheaf|presheaves]] on [[CRing]]${}^{op}$ 
which sends $(X, \mathcal{O}_X)$ to the functor

$$
  X(-) : A \mapsto Hom_{Schemes}(Spec A , (X, \mathcal{O}_X))
  \,.
$$

This identifies schemes as those presheafes on $[[CRing]]${}^{op}$ that are

* [[sheaf|sheaves]] with repspect to the Zariski [[Grothendieck topology]] on [[CRing]]${}^{op}$;

and

* have an open cover by [[affine scheme]].

## as locally affine structured $(\infty,1)$-toposes ##

On p. 37 of 

* [[Jacob Lurie]], [[Structured Spaces]]

it is argued that the standard definition of scheme with its insistance on an underlying topological space is slightly misleading:

> it is in some sense coincidental that $Spec A$ is described by a [[topological space]]. What arises more canonically is the [[lattice]] of open subsets of $Spec A$, which is generated by basic open sets of the form $U_f$. This lattice naturally forms a [[locale]], or [[0-topos]]. It happens that this [[locale]] has [[point of a topos|enough points]], and can therefore be described as the lattice of open subsets of a [[topological space]]. However, there are various reasons we might want to disregard this fact:

> a) The existence of [[point of a topos|enough points]] for $Spec A$ is equivalent to the assertion that every nonzero commutative ring contains a prime ideal, and the proof of this assertion requires the [[axiom of choice]].

> b) In _[[relative scheme|relative]]_ situations, the relevant construction may well fail to admit enough points, even if the [[axiom of choice]] is assumed. However, the underlying [[locale]] (and its associated sheaf theory) are still well-behaved

> c) If we wish to replace the Zariski topology by some other topology (such as the &#233;tale topology), then we are forced to work with $Spec A$ as a [[topos]] rather than simply as a [[topological space]]: the category of &eacute,tale [[sheaf|sheaves]] on $Spec A$ is [[localic topos|not generated by]] [[subobject]]s of the [[terminal object|final object]].

> When we study [[derived algebraic geometry]], we will want to study [[sheaf|sheaves]] on $Spec A$ of a [[higher category theory|higher categorical]] nature, such as sheaves of [[topological space]]s or sheaves of [[spectrum|spectra]]. For these purposes it will be most convenient to regard $Spec A$ as an [[(∞,1)-topos]], rather than as a [[topological space]]. 

From that perspective then a scheme is realized as a [[structured (∞,1)-topos]] with respect to the Zariski [[geometry (for structured (∞,1)-toposes)]] $\mathcal{G}_{Zar}$. See the examples at [[derived scheme]] for more details on this.

###### Proposition ([[Structured Spaces|StSp]], 4.2.9)

Let $Sch_{\leq 0}^{\leq 0}(\mathcal{G}_{Zar}) \subset Sch(\mathcal{G}_{Zar})$ be the full subcategory of all [[derived scheme]]s on the [[n-truncated structured (infinity,1)-topos|0-trucated]] and [[n-localic (infinity,1)-topos|0-localic]] ones. This is canonically equivalent to the ordinary category $Sch(k)$ of schemes over $k$:

$$
  Sch_{\leq 0}^{\leq 0}(\mathcal{G}_{Zar}(k))
  \simeq
  Sch(k)
  \,.

#Generalizations#

In [[algebraic geometry]] this is a basic object of study, since the revolution of [[Grothendieck]]. There are generalizations like __relative schemes__ (which are just objects in a [[slice category]] $Scheme/S$), relative schemes in [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]] introduced by A. Rosenberg in terms of categories and covers defined using pairs of [[adjoint functors]], the generalized schemes of [[Nikolai Durov]], the [[algebraic stack]]s of [[Deligne-Mumford stack|Deligne-Mumford]] and Artin, the dg-schemes of Kapranov, the [[derived scheme]]s of [[Jacob Lurie]], the higher [[algebraic stack]]s of [[Bertrand Toen|Toën]]--Vezzosi, almost schemes (Ofer Gabber and Lorenzo Ramero), formal schemes (Cartier--Grothendieck), [[locally affine spaces]] in the fpqc, fppf or &#233;tale topology (Grothendieck), [[algebraic spaces]], etc.
