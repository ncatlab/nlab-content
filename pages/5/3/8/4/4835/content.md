
## Idea

In [[quantum field theory]] the term _operator product expansion_ (OPE) refers to [[Taylor expansion]] of products in the [[algebra of quantum observables]] of [[field observables]] $\mathbf{\Phi}^a(x)$ in the form

$$
  \mathbf{\Phi}^a(x) \mathbf{\Phi}^b(y)
  \sim
  C^{a b}{}_c(x) \mathbf{\Phi}^c(y)
$$

where "$\sim$" means something like "as $x$ gets close to $y$ the [[expectation values]] in the given [[vacuum state]] of [[observables]] proportional to the left hand side approach those of observables proportional to the right hand side", schematically:

$$
  \left\langle
    \mathbf{\Phi}^a(x) \mathbf{\Phi}^b(y)
    A
  \right\rangle
  \underset{x \to y}{\longrightarrow}
  C^{a b}{}_c(x)
  \left\langle
    \mathbf{\Phi}^c(y)
    A
  \right\rangle
$$


If the [[algebra of observables]] is [[representation|represented]] via [[operator-valued distributions]] [[action|acting]] on some [[Hilbert space]], as commonly assumed, then this becomes an expansion of ([[product of distributions|distributional]]) [[operator products]], whence the name _operator product expansion_.



Mantra in the case of [[perturbative QFT]]: perturbative QFTs are about the deformation theory controlled by certain L-infinity algebra which is constructed from OPE-s
