Jeff Giansiracusa is an EPSRC funded research fellow at University of Bath in the Department of Mathematical Sciences. He works on homotopy theoretic aspects of moduli spaces, operads, topological field theory, and diffeomorphism groups, using topological techniques from algebraic K-theory to study the homotopy theory of moduli spaces arising in algebraic geometry.
