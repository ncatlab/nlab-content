The _Poisson sigma model_ is a 2-dimennsional [[sigma-model]] [[quantum field theory]] whose target space is a [[Poisson Lie algebroid]]. This may be thought of as encoding the [[quantum mechanics]] of a [[string theory|string]] propagating on the [[phase space]] of a system in [[classical mechanics]].

In his solution of the problem of [[deformation quantization]] [[Maxim Kontsevich]] showed that correlators for the 2-string interaction (the correlator on the worldsheet that is a disk with three marked points on its boundary) describe a product operation which is a deformation of the Poisson bracket on the target space.
