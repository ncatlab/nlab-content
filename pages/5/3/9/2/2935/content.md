## Idea 

The _Poisson $\sigma$-model_ is a 2-dimensional [[sigma-model]] [[quantum field theory]] whose target space is a [[Poisson Lie algebroid]]. This may be thought of as encoding the [[quantum mechanics]] of a [[string theory|string]] propagating on the [[phase space]] of a system in [[classical mechanics]]. 

In his solution of the problem of [[deformation quantization]] [[Maxim Kontsevich]] showed that correlators for the 2-string interaction (the correlator on the worldsheet that is a disk with three marked points on its boundary) describe a product operation which is a deformation of the [[Poisson bracket]] on the target space. This solves the formal [[deformation quantization]] problem of the phase space in [[quantum mechanics]] by identifying the quantum algebra with the _open string algebra_ of a [[string theory]] on that target.

The principal variant of the nonlinear Poisson sigma model is sometimes called Cattaneo-Felder model who have shown the graphical expansion used in Kontsevich's approach to the deformation quantization is explained via a Feynman diagram expansion in this model. 

If one considers [[brane]]s in the target space of the Poisson sigma-model, then then algebra of open strings that used to be just the deformation of the Poisson algebra becomes an [[A-infinity algebra|A-infinity algebroid]]. (See the references below).

> Probably something close to a [[Calabi-Yau category]], hence identifying the Poisson sigma-model as a [[TCFT]]. Does anyone know more in this direction?

## References

The notion of Poisson sigma model  was originally introduced by P. Schaller, T. Strobl and K. Ikeda, motivated from an attempt to unify several two-dimensional models of [[gravity]] and to cast them into a common form with [[Yang-Mills theory|Yang-Mills theories]].
