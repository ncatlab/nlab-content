## Idea

In [[constructive mathematics]], **Brouwer's continuity principle** ([Shulman 2018](#Shulman18)) states that all [[endofunctions]] on the (Dedekind) [[real numbers]] are [[pointwise continuous functions]]. It is inconsistent with [[excluded middle]] because excluded middle implies the [[analytic LPO]], from which one can construct the discontinuous [[floor]] and [[ceiling]] functions on the real numbers, contradicting Brouwer's continuity principle. 

Brouwer's continuity principle holds in Johnstone's [[topological topos]]. It also holds for the cohesive types in [[real-cohesive homotopy type theory]], which has semantics in the [[cohesive infinity-topos]] of [[Euclidean-topological infinity-groupoids]]. 

## Variants

There are a few different continuity principles which are sometimes called Brouwer's continuity principle. 

* One of them states that all functions from the [[Baire space]] $\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}$ to the natural numbers are continuous. 

* Another one states that all functions from the [[Cantor space]] $\mathbb{2}^\mathbb{N}$ to the natural numbers are continuous. 

* More generally, one can postulate similar Brouwer's continuity principles for any set $X$ and any notion of continuity (i.e. [[pointwise continuity]], [[uniform continuity]], [[Lipschitz continuity]], etc). 

### Untruncated versions

In the definitions of the different notions of continuous function one sees the phrase "there exist", which is usually represented by the [[existential quantifier]]. In [[dependent type theory]] one can instead use the [[dependent sum type]], resulting in untruncated versions of Brouwer's continuity principles. Due to the [[type theoretic principle of choice]] (i.e. the fact that dependent sum types distribute over dependent product types), this means that each continuous function comes with a choice of modulus of continuity in the untruncated versions of Brouwer's continuity principles. 

* The statement that all functions from the [[Baire space]] $\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}$ to the natural numbers have a choice of modulus of pointwise continuity is inconsistent. 

* The statement that all functions from the [[Cantor space]] $\mathbb{2}^\mathbb{N}$ to the natural numbers have a choice of modulus of uniform continuity is equivalent to the statement that functions from the [[Cantor space]] to the natural numbers are uniformly continuous (i.e. the untruncated and truncated versions are equivalent to each other).
