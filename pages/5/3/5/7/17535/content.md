## Definition

A _bornological coarse space_ is a set&#160;$X$
equipped with a [[bornology]]&#160;$B$
and a [[coarse structure]]&#160;$C$
that are compatible: controlled thickenings of bounded subsets are bounded.

Here a U-controlled thickening ($U\subset X\times X$)
of a subset&#160;$B$ of&#160;$X$
is the projection of $X\times B\cap U$ onto its first factor.

A _morphism_ of bornological coarse spaces is a map&#160;$f$
of sets that is _controlled_ (for every $U\in C$ we
have $(f\times f)(U)\in C'$) and _proper_ (for every $B'\in B'$
we have $f^{-1}(B')\in B$).

Bornological coarse spaces can be used as a [[site with an interval]]
to construct [[motivic coarse spaces]].
