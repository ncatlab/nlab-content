Philip J. Higgins (born 1926, died March 25, 2015) was a British  mathematician, who  worked in areas of algebra and algebraic topology.  He is well known for his book 

## Selected writings

On [[categories]] and [[groupoids]]:

* [[Philip J. Higgins]], *Categories and Groupoids*, Mathematical  Studies **32**, van Nostrand New  York (1971), Reprints in Theory and Applications of Categories **7** (2005) 1-195 &lbrack;[tac:tr7] (http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/7/tr7abs.html), [pdf](http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/7/tr7-2a4.pdf)&rbrack;

For his long standing collaboration with [[Ronnie Brown]] on [[nonabelian algebraic topology]], see [here](http://groupoids.org.uk/nonab-a-t.html).

His earlier paper

* P. J. Higgins, _Algebras with a scheme of operators_, Math. Nachr. 27 (1963) 115--132.

 has been influential: it deals with partial operations, following on from his paper

* P. J. Higgins, _Groups with multiple operators_, Proc London Math. Soc. VI (1956) 366-416.  


His paper

* P. J. Higgins, _The fundamental groupoid of a graph of groups_, J. London Math. Soc. (2), 13 (1976)  145--149,

developed methods that were later on used by [[Haefliger]] in assigning a groupoid to a complex of groups.


More recently he had worked with [[Kirill Mackenzie]] on [[Lie groupoids]] and [[Lie algebroids]]
