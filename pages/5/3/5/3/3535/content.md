
Philip J. Higgins (1926-2015) was a British  mathematician, who  worked in areas of [[algebra]] and [[algebraic topology]].  He is author of a book on [[categories]] and [[groupoids]] &lbrack;[Higgins 1971](#Higgins71)&rbrack;. In later years Higgins worked with [[Ronnie Brown]].


## Selected writings

On [[categories]] and [[groupoids]]:

* {#Higgins71} [[Philip J. Higgins]], *Categories and Groupoids*, Mathematical  Studies **32**, van Nostrand New  York (1971), Reprints in Theory and Applications of Categories **7** (2005) 1-195 &lbrack;[tac:tr7] (http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/7/tr7abs.html), [pdf](http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/7/tr7-2a4.pdf)&rbrack;

On [[algebraic topology]] using [[strict âˆž-groupoids]] (often in the equivalent guise of [[crossed complexes]], slightly "nonabelian" [[chain complexes]]):

* [[Ronnie Brown]], [[Philip Higgins]], [[Rafael Sivera]]: *[[Nonabelian Algebraic Topology]]: filtered spaces, crossed complexes, cubical homotopy groupoids*, Tracts in Mathematics **15**, European Mathematical Society (2011) &lbrack;ISBN 978-3-03719-083-8, [doi:10.4171/083](https://doi.org/10.4171/083), [webpage](http://groupoids.org.uk/nonab-a-t.html)&rbrack;

His earlier paper

* P. J. Higgins, _Algebras with a scheme of operators_, Math. Nachr. 27 (1963) 115--132.

 has been influential: it deals with partial operations, following on from his paper

* P. J. Higgins, _Groups with multiple operators_, Proc London Math. Soc. VI (1956) 366-416.  


His paper

* P. J. Higgins, _The fundamental groupoid of a graph of groups_, J. London Math. Soc. (2), 13 (1976)  145--149,

developed methods that were later on used by [[Haefliger]] in assigning a groupoid to a complex of groups.


More recently he had worked with [[Kirill Mackenzie]] on [[Lie groupoids]] and [[Lie algebroids]]
