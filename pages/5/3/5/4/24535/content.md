While a [[ring]] is a set with two operations, (Abelian) group with respect to one and semigroup with respect to another with a standard two-sided distributivity law, a truss is a similar structure with a different distributivity law. They appear in a number of subjects including the study of solutions to [[quantum Yang-Baxter equation]], ideal ring extensions, [[Hopf-Galois extension]]s, [[inverse semigroup]]s etc. 

If we drop Abelianess of the "additive" group then we talk about a more general notion of a skew truss (which is therefore to [[near-ring]] roughly what a truss is to a ring).
