This is an experiment. As with any experiment, it may flop.

The idea is to create a series of "Understandings", i.e. tutorial references that work through category-theoretic constructions for various categories. Hopefully, each Understanding will be fairly homogeneous in structure, e.g. we define the category briefly with a reference to its formal page and then proceed to work through specific constructions in gory detail with specific examples. 

These pages are to be friendly in nature with a similar spirit as [[John Baez]]' [This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/TWF.html).

Here is a list of pages we hope to get started on:

* [[Understanding limits in Set]]
* [[Understanding colimits in Set]]
* [[Understanding M-Set]]

Here is an initial list of constructions to include (originally designed for [[Set]]):

Under [[limits]]:

* [[terminal object]]
* binary [[products]]
* arbitrary (but small) [[products]]
* [[equalisers]]
* [[pullbacks]]
* [[fibred products]]

Under [[colimits]]:

* [[coterminal object]]
* binary [[coproducts]]
* arbitrary (but small) [[coproducts]]
* [[coequalisers]]
* [[pushouts]]
* [[cofibered coproduct|cofibred coproducts]]

Other constructions:

* [[exponential objects]]
* [[dependent products]]
* [[power objects]]
* probably more
