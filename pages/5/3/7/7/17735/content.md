[[Lebesgue integral]]s are defined as a construction in [[measure theory]], that is the measure precedes the integral; alternatively one can introduce integrals as linear functionals satisfying some axioms, in that approach measure can be defined using integral, hence the integral precedes measure. A [[Daniell integral]] is a particular axiomatically defined type of such functionals.
