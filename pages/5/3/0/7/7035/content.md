The term _intertwiner_ is a synonym for _[[homomorphism]] of [[representations]]/[[actions]]/[[modules]]_.

Notably for [[linear representations]] $\rho_1$, $\rho_2$ of some [[group]] or [[associative algebra]] $A$ on [[vector spaces]] $V_1, V_2$, a [[linear map]] $u : V_1 \to V_2$ is said to _intertwine_ $\rho_1$ with $\rho_2$ if for all $a \in A$ we have that

$$
  u \circ \rho_1(a) = \rho_2(a)\circ u   
  \,.
$$
