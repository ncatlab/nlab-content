An **preadditive category** is a category [[enriched category|enriched]] over [[abelian group]]s with their [[tensor product]].  In elementary terms, this means that each [[hom-set]] is an abelian group and composition is bilinear.

In a preadditive category, any [[initial object|initial]] or [[terminal object|terminal]] object is automatically a [[zero object]]; more generally, any finite [[product]] or [[coproduct]] is automatically a [[biproduct]].  However, these need not exist at all.

An **additive category** is a preadditive category having all finite biproducts.  But originally (and often still) this requirement is not included in the term 'additive'.

An especially important sort of additive category is an [[abelian category]].
