## Idea

In [[dependent type theory]], a notion of [[finite type]] for [[types]] which are not just [[h-sets]]. 

## Definition

A type is a **$\pi$-finite type** if if it has finitely many connected components and there exists a [[natural number]] $n$ such that all its [[homotopy groups]] up to [[h-level]] $n$ at all base points are finite. 

For given [[natural number]] $n$, a type is a **$\pi_n$-finite type** if it has finitely many connected components and all its [[homotopy groups]] up to [[h-level]] $n$ at all base points are finite.
