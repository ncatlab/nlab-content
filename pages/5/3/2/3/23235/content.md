see also [Kauer-Roggenkamp](https://github.com/The-Singularity-Research/cirq_hybrid_codes/blob/master/higher-dimensional-orders-graph-orders-and-derived-equivalences.pdf) for general form of mutations of graph orders, as well as [Gnedin](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08895) for Calabi-Yau properties. This relates to the construction of a AQFT related to Artin L-functions and dessins d'enfants. This is related to [Seiberg duality](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/quiver+gauge+theory) in type IIB string theory derived from quiver gauge theories.
