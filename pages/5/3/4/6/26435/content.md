${^d\bigwedge}$ can be intuitively understood as the space where the canonical vertex differential coalgebra exists over some division algebra.

this, of course is the generalization of quadratic operad.
the way d acts on 5 can be numeric or '5' can be a variable holding a polynomial... this, is one view as to what the true canonical [[quadratic operad]] is. 

the quadratic operation for an operad is the tensor product effectively.
