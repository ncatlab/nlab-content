${^d\bigwedge}$ can be intuitively understood as the space where the canonical vertex differential coalgebra exists over some division algebra.

this, of course is the generalization of quadratic operad.
the way d acts on 5 can be numeric or '5' can be a variable holding a polynomial... this, is one view as to what the true canonical [[quadratic operad]] is. 

the quadratic operation for an operad is the tensor product effectively.

the quadratic operad canonically might be two kinds of zero infinity with which I am referring to currently and how they interact with regards to the tensor product in an array.

Zero Infinity 1:
Zero is it's own inverse algebraically 

Zero infinity 2:
Zero is an ideal multiplicitavely and zero is effectively something one can think of when one thinks of a singularity in algebra
making it both a vacuum and an infinity.
