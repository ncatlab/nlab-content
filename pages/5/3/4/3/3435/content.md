* [[Pierre Gabriel|P. Gabriel]], M. Zisman, _Calculus of Fractions and Homotopy Theory_, Springer 1967. Ergebnisse der Mathematik und ihrer Grenzgebiete, Band 35.

This book first introduced a general [[localization]] of a category by  an arbitrary class of morphisms (nowdays called the [[Gabriel-Zisman localization]]); however the [[size issues]] are not discussed and the formalism of universes is understood as an excuse. The special case of [[calculus of fractions|categories of fractions]] is treated in detail. 

The book has large historical importance for a clean and inovative formalism treating the interaction of [[category theory]] (including [[adjoint functors]], [[Kan extensions]], [[strict 2-category|strict 2-categories]]), simplicial methods and [[homotopy theory]]. An important version of a definition of a [[homotopy category]] by the abstract categorical localization by the class of [[weak equivalences]] is introduced. It has been proved that the homotopy categories of [[CW complexes]] and of [[simplicial sets]] are equivalent. The method of the notion of a fundamental category of a simplicial set (now sometimes also called the homotopy category), refining in a sense the notion of [[fundamental groupoid]], is defined using adjointness. An important method for studying [[cofibrations]] of simplicial sets, namely the notion of an [[anodyne extension]], is introduced for the first time and effectively used. 

The book is written in a recognizable abstract, clean and precise language with economic, rather short and formal, formulations.
