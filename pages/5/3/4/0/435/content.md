#Definition#

A _simplicially enriched category_ is a [[enriched category|category enriched over]] the [[monoidal category]] of [[simplicial set|simplicial sets]].

These enriched categories are sometimes, somewhat imprecisely, called just _[[simplicial category|simplicial categories]]_.


#Remarks#


* Simplicially enriched categories are one model for [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categories]]. They are a popular model in [[homotopy coherent category theory]].


#Simplicial groupoids#

There is a related notion of [[simplicial groupoid]] with the added requirement that all arrows in the categories concerned are [[isomorphism|isomorphisms]].
