There is a related ambiguous notion of simplicial groupoid which uses the second and third of these meanings with the added requirement that all arrows in the categories concerned are isomorphisms.  

Simplicially enriched groupoids are related to simplicial sets via a pair of adjoint functors found independently by Dwyer-Kan and Joyal and Tierney.  These adjoint functors give an equivalence of homotopy categories so that simplicially enriched groupoids model all homotopy types.
