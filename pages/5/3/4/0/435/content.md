#Definition#

A _simplicially enriched category_ is a [[enriched category|category enriched over]] the [[category]] of [[simplicial set|simplicial sets]].

These enriched categories are sometimes, somewhat imprecisely, called just _simplicial categories_.


#Remarks#


* Simplicially enriched categories are one model for [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categories]]. They are a popular model in [[homotopy coherent category theory]].


#Simplicial groupoids#

There is a related notion of **simplicial groupoid** with the added requirement that all arrows in the categories concerned are [[isomorphism|isomorphisms]].  

Simplicially enriched groupoids are related to [[simplicial set|simplicial sets]] via a pair of adjoint functors found independently by Dwyer-Kan and Joyal-Tierney.  These [[adjoint]] functors give an [[equivalence]] of [[homotopy category|homotopy categories]] so that simplicially enriched groupoids model all [[homotopy type|homotopy types]].
