#Definition#

A _simplicially enriched category_ is a [[enriched category|category enriched over]] the [[category]] of [[simplicial set|simplicial sets]].

These enriched categories are sometimes, somewhat imprecisely, called just _simplicial categories_.


#Remarks#


* Simplicially enriched categories are one model for [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categories]]. They are a popular model in [[homotopy coherent category theory]].


#Simplicial groupoids#

There is a related notion of **simplicial groupoid** with the added requirement that all arrows in the categories concerned are isomorphisms.  

Simplicially enriched groupoids are related to simplicial sets via a pair of adjoint functors found independently by Dwyer-Kan and Joyal and Tierney.  These adjoint functors give an equivalence of homotopy categories so that simplicially enriched groupoids model all homotopy types.
