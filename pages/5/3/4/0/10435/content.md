## Idea

Whereas the [[one-point compactification]] of a (sufficiently [[nice topological space|nice]]) [[topological space]] adjoins only a single [[point at infinity]], the _end compactification_ adjoins one point for each [[connected component]] of infinity. 

The theory of ends was invented by [[Hans Freudenthal]] in his dissertation, who gave a number of interesting applications (see below). 


## Definition

The definition was originally given only for sufficiently [[nice topological space|nice]] topological spaces (the [[hemicompact space|hemicompact]] ones).  The general definition is a bit more complicated.  We will give three versions.


### For hemicompact spaces only

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]], and suppose that $X$ is [[hemicompact space|hemicompact]]; this means that there exists an [[infinite sequence]] $n \mapsto K_n$ of [[compact subspaces]] of $X$ with $K_n \subseteq K_{n+1}$ such that every compact subspace of $X$ is contained in at least one (hence in almost all) of the $K_i$.

Consider the [[connected components]] of the [[complements]] $X \setminus K_i$.  An __end__ of $X$ is an infinite sequence that chooses one such connected component for each $i$.  Remarkably, the set of ends is independent of the sequence $K$ chosen (up to [[natural bijection]]).

The __end compactification__ of $X$ has, as its [[underlying set]], the [[disjoint union]] of the underlying set of $X$ and the set of ends.  Its [[topological structure|topology]] is generated (from a [[topological base|base]]) by the topology of $X$ and, for each end $e = (U_1,U_2,\ldots)$, the [[open sets]] $V \cup \{e\}$ whenever $V$ is open in $X$ and $U_i \subseteq V$ for some (hence almost every) $i$.


### Abstract

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]], and consider the [[poset]] $Comp(X)$ of [[compact subspaces]] of $X$, ordered by [[inclusion]].  For each compact subspace $K$, consider its [[complement]] $X \setminus K$, and consider the [[set]] $\Pi_0(X \setminus K)$ of its [[connected components]].  For each inclusion $K \hookrightarrow K'$, we have a [[function]] $\Pi_0(X \setminus K') \to \Pi_0(X \setminus K)$.  This defines a [[contravariant functor]] from $Comp(X)$ to [[Set]]; its [[limit]] is the __set of ends__ of $X$.

For the [[topological structure|topology]], each compact subspace $K$ defines a topological space $K \uplus \Pi_0(X \setminus K)$; here, the points of $\Pi_0(K \setminus K)$ are all [[isolated point|isolated]].  For each inclusion $K \hookrightarrow K'$, we have a [[continuous map]] $K' \uplus \Pi_0(X \setminus K') \to K \uplus \Pi_0(X \setminus K)$; it sends $x$ to itself if $x \in K$, and $x$ to the connected component $[x] \in \Pi_0(X \setminus K)$ if $x \in K' \setminus K$.  This defines a [[contravariant functor]] from $Comp(X)$ to [[Top]]; its [[limit]] is the __end compactification__ of $X$.


### Concrete

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]].  An __end__ of $X$ assigns, to each [[compact subspace]] $K$ of $X$, a [[connected component]] $e_K$ of its [[complement]] $X \setminus K$, in such a way that $e_{K'} \subseteq e_K$ whenever $K \subseteq K'$.  The __end compactification__ of $X$ has, as its [[underlying set]], the [[disjoint union]] of the underlying set of $X$ and the set of ends.  Its [[topological structure|topology]] is generated (from a [[topological base|base]]) by the topology of $X$ and, for each end $e\colon K \mapsto e_K$, the [[open sets]] $V \cup \{e\}$ whenever $V$ is open in $X$ and $e_K \subseteq V$ for some compact subspace $K$.


## Examples

A [[compact space]] has no ends, hence is its own end compactification.  The converse (that a space with no ends must be compact) seems to require the [[axiom of choice]] (although [[excluded middle]] and [[dependent choice]] suffice for hemicompact spaces).

The end compactification of the [[real line]] is the [[extended real number]] line segment; the ends are $\infty$ and $-\infty$.  But the [[complex plane]] has only one end; its end compactification is the [[Riemann sphere]] (the same as its [[one-point compactification]]).


## Applications

Ends are important in [[proper homotopy theory]]. 

According to [Peschke](#Peschke), Freudenthal was led to his theory of ends by the following observation. For a space $X$, consider a path-connected family $F \subseteq Homeo(X)$ containing the identity $1_X$. Let $K \subseteq X$ be compact, and let $U$ be a connected component of $X \setminus K$. Then for all $f \in F$, it may be shown $f(U) \setminus U$ is contained in a compact subset of $X$. The upshot is that $f$ extends to a homeomorphism on the end compactification that is *pointwise fixed* on the ends. If in addition for each pair $(x, y) \in X^2$ there is $f \in F$ with $f(x) = y$, then there is a severe constraint on the ends; in particular Freudenthal showed the following.

###### Theorem 
A path-connected topological group has at most two ends.

For example, it follows that the space obtained by removing two points from $\mathbb{R}^3$ cannot be given a topological group structure.
