$CRing$ is the category of commutative [[ring]]s and ring homomorphisms.

A commutative ring is a commutative [[monoid object]] in [[Ab]], so $CRing = CMon(Ab)$.  As for commutative monoid objects in any [[symmetric monoidal category]], the [[tensor product]] of commutative rings is again a commutative ring, and is the [[coproduct]] in $CRing$; thus $CRing$ is cocartesian monoidal.

$CRing^{op}$ is the category of [[affine scheme]]s.
