## Definition ##

$CRing$ is the category of commutative [[ring]]s and ring homomorphisms.

A commutative ring is a commutative [[monoid object]] in [[Ab]], so $CRing = CMon(Ab)$.  As for commutative monoid objects in any [[symmetric monoidal category]], the [[tensor product]] of commutative rings is again a commutative ring, and is the [[coproduct]] in $CRing$; thus $CRing$ is cocartesian monoidal.

The [[opposite category]] $CRing^{op}$ is the category of [[affine scheme]]s.

## Generalizations ##

* There is a "smooth" version of $CRing^{op}$: the category of [[smooth locus|smooth loci]],

* There is a [[higher category theory]] version of $CRing$: the [[(∞,1)-category]] of [[E-∞ ring]]s.
