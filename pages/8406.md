## Idea

What is called _Einstein-Maxwell theory_  in [[physics]] is the [[theory (physics)|theory]]/[[model (in theoretical physics)]] describing [[gravity]] together with [[electromagnetism]].

It is a [[local Lagrangian]] [[field (physics)|field]] theory defined by the [[action functional]] which is the [[Einstein-Hilbert action]] plus the [[Maxwell action functional]]  involving the given metric,

$$
  S_{G+EM}
  \;
   \colon
  \;
  (e, \nabla)
  \mapsto
  \int_{X} R(e) vol(e)
  + 
  \int_X F_\nabla \wedge \star_e F_\nabla
  \,,
$$

where 

* $X$ is the [[compact topological space|compact]] [[smooth manifold]] underlying [[spacetime]], 

* $e$ is the [[vielbein field]] which encodes the [[field (physics)|field]] of [[gravity]] 

* $\nabla$ is the $U(1)$-[[principal connection]] which encodes the [[electromagnetic field]], 

* $vol(e)$ is the [[volume form]] induced by $e$;

* $R(e)$ is the [[scalar curvature]] of $e$;

* $F_\nabla$ is the [[field strength]]/[[curvature]] [[differential 2-form]] of $\nabla$;

* $\star_e$ is the [[Hodge star]] operator induced by $e$.

This is the special case of [[Einstein-Yang-Mills theory]] for the [[gauge group]] being the [[circle group]].
