## Idea

An example of a rewriting system is given by a [[group presentation]], $(X,R)$, where $X$ is a set of generators for a group $G$ and $R$ is a subset of pairs of elements in the free group on $X$.  As a definite example, take 
 
* $X = \{a,b\}$

* $R = \{(a a a,1),(b b,1),(a b a b,1)\}$

(and the group being presented is the symmetric group, $S_3$ on three symbols).
We think of $(a a a,1)$ as a 'rewrite rule': ''replace $a a a$ by 1'', often written $a a a\to 1$.
 
Working with the presentation, we can then  start generating words in the generators, for instance $a a a b a b$ and then see how that word can be 'rewritten' using the rewrite rules to $b a b$ using the first rule and to $a a$ using the last. There is thus a potential conflict between these rewritten forms of the word.  In rewriting theory this sort of situation is studied in detail.

One of the strongest results on rewriting is Tibor Beke's categorification of certain rewriting procedures of Knuth. It is of great relevance for $n$lab as it contaions a strong result on coherence theory:
