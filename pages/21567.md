##Idea
The [[geometric theory|geometric]] **theory of categories** $\mathbb{K}$ is a [[first-order logic|first-order]] axiomatisation of the concept of a  [[category]]. $\mathbb{K}$ is (morally) an [[essentially algebraic theory]], and literally a cartesian theory i.e. _grosso modo_ a [[regular theory]] where existential quantification is provably unique.

Historically, the first axiomatisation was given by [[William Lawvere| F. William Lawvere]] in his [[Functorial Semantics of Algebraic Theories|dissertation]] in 1963 as part of a formalisation of the [[category of categories]]. (cf. Lawvere ([1963](#Law63},[1966](#Law66)) or [[ETCC]] for further information).

## Definition

The [[signature]] $\Sigma_\mathbb{K}$ has two sorts $O$ and $A$ for objects and arrows, respectively, three function symbols $d_0:A\to O$ , $d_1:A\to O$ and $id:O\to A$, assiging to morphisms their domain, respectively, codomain and to the objects their [[identity|identity morphisms]], as well as a relation symbol $C\rightarrowtail A\times A\times A$ expressing composition of morphisms.

The **theory of categories** is the theory $\mathbb{K}$ over the signature $\Sigma_\mathbb{K}$ with the following sequents:[^var]

[^var]: Here and in the following $x,y$ are variables ranging over O, whereas the $f_1,f_2,\dots$ range over A; the contexts are assumed to be standard i.e. consisting of all free variables occurring in a sequent.

* $\top\vdash d_0(id(x))=x\wedge d_1(id(x))=x\quad$ ,

* $C(f_1,f_2,f_3)\vdash d_0(f_1)=d_0(f_3)\wedge d_1(f_1)=d_0(f_2)\wedge d_1(f_2)=d_1(f_3)\quad $ ,

* $C(f_1,f_2,f_3)\wedge C(f_1,f_2,f_4)\vdash f_3=f_4\quad $ ,

* $d_1(f_1)=d_0(f_2)\vdash\exists f_3 C(f_1,f_2,f_3)\quad$ ,

* $\top \vdash C(f,id(d_1(f)),f)\wedge C(id(d_0(f)),f,f)\quad $ ,

* $C(f_1,f_2,f_4)\wedge C(f_2,f_3,f_5)\wedge C(f_4,f_3,f_6)\wedge C(f_1,f_5,f_7)\vdash f_6=f_7\quad $.

### Remark

The third axiom implies that the existential quantification occurring in the fourth axioms is unique thus $\mathbb{K}$ is indeed _cartesian_. Since the chosen signature uses a composition relation instead of a partial composition operation the theory as given here is not literally [[essentially algebraic theory|essentially algebraic]] in the syntactic sense, though, of course, it is [[Morita equivalence|Morita equivalent]] to an essentially algebraic axiomatisation. Other signatures, like a single sorted "arrows only" one, are also possible, the one used here (taken from Johnstone [1977](#J77)) leans on the so called **elementary theory of abstract categories** as presented in Lawvere ([1966](#Law66)).

## Properties

Foremost, we have

###### Proposition

Let $\mathcal{E}$ be a [[Grothendieck topos]]. Then $Mod_{\mathbb{K}}(\mathcal{E})=cat(\mathcal{E})$ with $cat(\mathcal{E})$ the category of (small) [[internal category|internal categories]] in $\mathcal{E}$ with internal functors as morphisms.$\qed$

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition
The [[classifying topos]] $Set[\mathbb{K}]$ is the presheaf topos on the opposite of the category of finitely presentable categories in $Set$.
=--

This follows from the fact that the classifying toposes of [[cartesian theory|cartesian theories]] are generally given as the presheaf toposes on the opposite of the category of finitely presentable models in $Set$ (cf. Johnstone [2002](#J02), p.891).$\qed$


## Some related theories

*  The [[theory of model homomorphisms|theory $\mathbb{K}^2$ of $\mathbb{K}$-model homomorphisms]] is the **theory of functors**.

* By adding the following sequents to $\mathbb{K}$ one obtains the **theory of filtered categories** $\mathbb{K}^\gt$ with models the internal [[filtered category|filtered categories]] (cf. Johnstone [1977](#J77), p.203):

  $\array{\\
\top\vdash \exists x (x=x)
\\
\\ 
\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\top\vdash \exists f_1\exists f_2 (d_0(f_1)=x\wedge d_0(f_2)=y\wedge d_1(f_1)=d_1(f_2))
\\
d_0(f_1)=d_0(f_2)\wedge d_1(f_1)=d_1(f_2)\vdash \exists f_3\exists f_4\big (C(f_1,f_3,f_4)\wedge C(f_2,f_3,f_4)\big )\quad}$
