## Idea

Many aspects of the theory of "[[topological strings]]" (the [[A-model]] and the [[B-model]]) proceed in close analogy (just simpler) to the "physical" [[string theory]]. Accordingly, as the latter can usefully be organized as the dimensional reduction of a conjectured [[UV-completion]] of [[11-dimensional supergravity]] -- [[M-theory]] -- there seems to be an analogous higher dimensional organizational principle for topological strings, hence termed _topological M-theory_.

One way to understand it is as a [[TQFT]]-analog of the [[M2-brane]] [[sigma-model]], the _[[topological membrane]]_.
