## Idea

In [[logic]], the _existential quantifier_ "$\exists$" is a [[quantifier]] used to express, given a [[proposition]] $\phi$ about [[terms]] $x$ of [[type]] $X$, the proposition

$$
  \exists x : X, \phi x
  \,,
$$

which asserts that there is (at least) one term $x$ for which $\phi(x)$ is [[true]].

## Definition

In terms of the [[internal logic]] in some ambient [[topos]] $\mathcal{E}$, 

* a [[type]] $X$ is given by an [[object]] $X \in \mathcal{E}$, 

* the [[proposition]] $\phi$ is a [[(-1)-truncated]] object of the [[over-topos]] $\mathcal{E}/X$;

* a [[truth value]] is a [[(-1)-truncated]] object of $\mathcal{E}$ itself.

Existential quantification is essentially the extra [[left adjoint]] of the canonical [[étale geometric morphism]]

$$
    \mathcal{E}/X
    \stackrel{\overset{\exists}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{- \times X}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\forall}{\to}}}
    \mathcal{E} 
  \,,
$$

where $(-) \times X$ is the functor that forms the [[product]] with $X$, $\exists$ is the [[dependent sum]] and $\forall$ is the [[dependent product]] operation.

This operation restricts to [[propositions]] by pre- and postcomposition with the [[truncated|truncation]] [[adjunctions]]

$$
  \tau_{\leq -1} \mathcal{E}
  \stackrel{\overset{\tau_{\leq -1}}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{}{\hookrightarrow}}
  \mathcal{E}
$$

to give

$$
  \array{
    \mathcal{E}/X
    & 
    \stackrel{\overset{\exists}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{- \times X}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\forall}{\to}}}
    &
    \mathcal{E}
    \\
    \mathllap{\tau_{\leq_{-1}}}\downarrow \uparrow
    &&
    \mathllap{\tau_{\leq_{-1}}}\downarrow \uparrow
    \\
    \tau_{\leq_{-1}} 
    \mathcal{E}/X
    &&
    \tau_{\leq_{-1}} \mathcal{E}
  }
  \,.
$$

In other words, we obtain the existential quantifier by applying the dependent sum, then (-1)-truncating the result.  This is equivalent to constructing the [[image]] as a subobject of the codomain.

Dually, the [[direct image functor]] $\forall$ (dependent product) expresses the [[universal quantifier]].  (In this case, it is somewhat simpler, since the dependent product automatically preserves (-1)-truncated objects; no additional truncation step is necessary.)

The same makes verbatim sense also in the [[(∞,1)-logic]] of any [[(∞,1)-topos]].

## Examples

Let $\mathcal{E} = $ [[Set]], let $X = \mathbb{N}$ be the set of [[natural number]]s and let $\phi := 2\mathbb{N} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{N}$ be the [[subset]] of even natural numebrs. This expresses the [[proposition]] $\phi(x) := IsEven(x)$. 

Then the [[dependent sum]] 

$$
  (\phi \in Set/{\mathbb{N}})
  \mapsto 
  (\sum_{x : X} \phi(x) \in Set)
$$

is simply the set $2 \mathbb{N} \in Set$ of even natural numebrs. Since this is [[inhabited]], its [[truncated|(-1)-truncation]] is therefore the singleton set, hence the [[truth value]] _[[true]]_. Indeed, there exists an even natural number!

Notice that before the (-1)-truncation the operation remembers not just _that_ there is an even number, but it remembers "all proofs that there is one", namely every example of an even number.
