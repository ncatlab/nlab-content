#Idea#

The concept of **$\infty$-topos** is to the concept [[topos]] as [[infinity-category]] is to [[category]].

More generally, the concept _$(n,r)$-topos_ is to [[topos]] as [[(n,r)-category]] is to [[category]].

Just as the archetypical example of an ordinary [[topos]] (i.e. a $(1,1)$-topos) is [[Set]] -- the category of [[0-category|0-categories]] -- so the $\infty$-category of [[n-category|n-categories]] or at least of $n$-[[groupoid]]s should form the archetypical example of an $(n+1,1)$-topos. 

This story has been realized in detail for the [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categorical]] case of [[(infinity,1)-topos|(infinity,1)-topoi]]. Indeed, the [[(infinity,1)-category]] of [[infinity-groupoid]]s is the archetypical example of an $(\infty,1)$-topos.

For larger values of $r$ in [[(n,r)-category|(n,r)-topos]] the situation is currently less clear. For some remarks about this see * [[michaelshulman:n-topos for large n|n-topos for large n]].
