## Idea

In [[quantum field theory]] the term _operator product expansion_ (OPE) refers to [[Taylor expansion]] of products in the [[algebra of quantum observables]] of [[field observables]] $\mathbf{\Phi}^a(x)$ in the form

$$
  \label{SchematicOPE}
  \mathbf{\Phi}^a(x) \mathbf{\Phi}^b(y)
  \;\sim\;
  C^{a b}{}_c(x) \mathbf{\Phi}^c(y)
  \,.
$$

Here "$\sim$" means something like "as $x$ gets close to $y$ the [[expectation values]] in the given [[vacuum state]] of [[observables]] proportional to the left hand side approach those of observables proportional to the right hand side", schematically:

$$
  \left\langle
    \mathbf{\Phi}^a(x) \mathbf{\Phi}^b(y)
    A
  \right\rangle
  \underset{x \to y}{\longrightarrow}
  C^{a b}{}_c(x)
  \left\langle
    \mathbf{\Phi}^c(y)
    A
  \right\rangle
$$

If the [[algebra of observables]] is [[representation|represented]] via [[operator-valued distributions]] [[action|acting]] on some [[Hilbert space]], as commonly assumed, then this becomes an expansion of ([[product of distributions|distributional]]) [[operator products]], whence the name _operator product expansion_ ([Wilson 69](#Wilson69), [Wilson-Zimmermann 72](#WilsonZimmermann72)).

For [[conformal field theory]] and specifically for [[2d CFT]] the operator product expansion is well understood, is neatly captured by the concept of [[vertex operator algebras]]. Via the _[[conformal bootstrap]]_ the equation (eq:SchematicOPE) defines or at least constrains the conformal field theory ([Ferrara-Grillo-Gatto 73](#FerraraGrilloGatto73), [Polyakov 74](#Polyakov74), [Belavin-Polyakov-Zamolodchikov 84](#BelavinPolyakovZamolodchikov84)).

Attempts to similarly use the concept of the operator product expansion to _define_ more general [[perturbative quantum field theory]] (and possibly [[non-perturbative quantum field theory]]) are discussed in ([Hollands-Olbermann 09](#HollandsOlbermann09), [Holland-Hollands 13](#HollandHollands13)). The concept of [[factorization algebras]], rooted as it is in that of [[vertex operator algebras]], may be thought of as meaning to axiomatize operator product expansions in the generality of Euclidean ([[Wick rotation|Wick rotated]]) field theory.

Apparently [Kontsevich 10](#Kontsevich10) suggested that [[perturbative QFT]] should be thought of as the [[deformation theory]] controlled by a certain [[L-infinity algebra]] which is constructed from OPEs.
