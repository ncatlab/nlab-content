A __Karoubian category__ is a [[additive and abelian categories|preadditive category]] $C$ such that every [[idempotent]] morphism $P: A \to A$ in $C$ has a [[kernel]]. It is also called a __pseudo-abelian category__ (also spelled pseudoabelian).

There is a [[reflective subcategory|universal functor]] from the category of (say, small) preadditive categories to the category of Karoubian categories, the __Karoubinization functor__; its value on a preadditive category $C$ is also called the __Karoubian envelope__ or the __pseudo-abelian completion__ of $C$. 

The requirement that, say, a [[dg-category]] or a [[triangulated category]] be Karoubian is a natural requirement in a number of contexts. The Karoubian envelope is also used in the construction of the category of [[pure motive]]s, and in $K$-[[K-theory|theory]].
