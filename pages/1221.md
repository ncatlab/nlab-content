A __Karoubian category__ is a [[additive and abelian categories|preadditive category]] $C$ such that every [[idempotent]] morphism $P : A\to A$ in $C$ has a kernel. It is also called a pseudo-abelian category.

There is a universal functor from the category of (say, small) preadditive category to the category of Karoubian categories, Karoubinization functor; its value on preadditive category $C$ is also called the Karoubian envelope or the pseudo-abelian completion of $C$. 

Requirement that say a dg-category or a triangulated category is Karoubian is a natural requirement in a number of contexts. Karoubian envelope is also used in the construction of the category of [[pure motive]]s, and in $K$-theory.
