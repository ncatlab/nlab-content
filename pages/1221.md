A __Karoubian category__ is a [[additive and abelian categories|preadditive category]] $C$ such that every [[idempotent]] morphism $P: A \to A$ in $C$ has a [[kernel]]. It is also called a __pseudo-abelian category__ (also spelled pseudoabelian).

There is a [[reflective subcategory|universal functor]] from the category of (say, small) preadditive categories to the category of Karoubian categories, the __Karoubinization functor__; its value on a preadditive category $C$ is also called the __Karoubian envelope__ or the __pseudo-abelian completion__ of $C$. 

The requirement that, say, a [[dg-category]] or a [[triangulated category]] be Karoubian is a natural requirement in a number of contexts. The Karoubian envelope is also used in the construction of the category of [[pure motive]]s, and in $K$-[[K-theory|theory]].

# Definition

Let $C$ be a category and $p : X \to X$ an [[idempotent]] [[endomorphism]] of an object $X$.  One says that $p$ **admits an image** if the functor $Ker(id_X, p)$ is [[representable]], and the representing object is called the image of $p$.  Here $Ker(id_X, p)$ is the functor $C^{op} \to \underline{Set}$ mapping

$$ Y \mapsto Ker(Hom(Y, X) \rightrightarrows Hom(Y, X)); \qquad (\ast) $$

in other words the image of $p$ is the [[equaliser|difference kernel]] of $(id_X, p)$, when it exists.

Now $C$ is called **Karoubian** if every idempotent $p$ admits an image.

# Properties

One can show that for any idempotent $p$, $Ker(id_X, p)$ is representable if and only if $Coker(id_X, p)$ is, and that in fact their representing objects are canonically isomorphic.

Recall that one says $p$ **splits** if there exists an object $Y$, and morphisms $f : X \to Y$, $g : Y \to X$, such that $f \circ g = id_Y$ and $g \circ f = p$.  Observe that when $p$ admits an image $K$, it splits: by definition there are functorial isomorphisms $\Phi_Y$ for all $Y$ between the image of the functor $(\ast)$ and $\Hom(Y, K)$; now take $f : X \to K$ the morphism corresponding to $p$ via $\Phi_X$, $g : K \to X$ the morphism corresponding to $id_K \in Hom(K, K)$ via $\Phi_K$.  (Presumably the converse also holds...?)

# Karoubi envelope

There exists a Karoubian category $kar(C)$ associated to any category $C$, and a fully faithful functor $\varphi : C \to kar(C)$, which is [[universal property | universal]] in the sense that for any Karoubian category $C'$, the functor

$$\underline{Hom}(kar(C), C') \to \underline{Hom}(C, C')$$

taking a functor $F : kar(C) \to C'$ to the composite $F \circ \varphi$ is an [[equivalence]] of categories.  $kar(C)$ is called the **Karoubi envelope** of $C$.  It can be realized explicitly by taking as objects pairs $(X, p)$, with $p$ idempotent, and as morphisms $(X, p) \to (Y, q)$ the morphisms $f : X \to Y$ that satisfy $f = q \circ f \circ p$.
