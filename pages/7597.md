## Idea

An _projective [[algebraic variety]]_ (over an [[algebraically closed field]] $k$) is the 0-locus of a [[homogeneous polynomial|homogeneous]] [[polynomial]] of $(n+1)$ variables over $k$ in the [[projective space|projective n-space]] $\mathbb{P}^n$.

## Examples

The archetypical example is [[projective space]] itself. In direct generalization of this but less evident: every [[Grassmannian]] is naturally a projective variety, even a [[smooth variety|smooth variety]]. 

This generalizes to [[quiver representations]]. Every Grassmannian of a Quiver representation is a projective variety. In fact, every projective variety arises this way ([Reineke, '12](#Reineke)).
