## Idea

By _real cohomology_ one usually means [[ordinary cohomology]] with [[real number]] [[coefficients]], denoted $H^\bullet\big(-, \mathbb{R}\big)$.

Hence, with the pertinent conditions on the [[domain]] [[space]] $X$ satisfied, its real cohomology $H^\bullet\big(-, \mathbb{R}\big)$ is what is computed by the [[Cech cohomology]] or [[singular cohomology]] or [[sheaf cohomology]] of $X$ with coefficients in $\mathbb{R}$.

In particuar, for $X$ a [[smooth manifold]], the [[de Rham theorem]] says that real cohomology of $X$ is also computed by the [[de Rham cohomology]] of $X$

$$
  H^\bullet\big( X, \mathbb{R}\big)
  \;\simeq\;
  H^\bullet_{dR}\big( X \big)
  \,.
$$

More generally,  for $X$ a smooth manifold with smooth [[action]] of a [[connected topological space|connected]] [[compact Lie group]], the [[equivariant de Rham theorem]] says that the real cohomology of the [[homotopy quotient]] (e.g. [[Borel construction]]) of $X$ is computed by the [[Cartan model]] for [[equivariant de Rham cohomology]] on $X$.
