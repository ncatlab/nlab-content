## Idea

Given a suitable [[subspace]] inclusion $X \hookrightarrow \hat X$ and a [[distribution]] $u$ on $X$, then an _extension_  of $u$ to $\hat X$ is an distribution $\hat u$ on $\hat X$ whose restriction to $X$ coincdes with $u$. If $u$ comes from an ordinary [[smooth function]] or else if $u$ is properly understood as a [[generalized function]], then this corresponds to an ordinary [[extension]]

$$
  \array{
    X &\overset{u}{\longrightarrow}& \mathbb{R}
    \\
    \downarrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\hat u}}
    \\
    \hat X
  }
$$

Of particular interest is the special case of extension to a single point $p \in \hat X$, hence where $X = \hat X \setminus \{p\}$. Contrary to ordinary functions, distributions in general have more than one extension to a point, where the freedom is in choosing a [[distribution with point support]] at that point, hence some [[derivative]] of the [[delta distribution]] at that point. However, if one requires that the [[scaling degree of a distribution|scaling degree]] of the extended distribution at the given point is compatible with that of the original distribution, then there is only a [[finite set]] of possible extensions, parameterized by the [[coefficients]] of a finite number of derivatives of the delta-distribution. 

In the construction of [[perturbative quantum field theories]] via [[causal perturbation theory]], where the distributions in questions are coefficients in the [[scattering matrix]] and where the point being extended to corresponds to the point where an [[interaction]] happens, this finite set of choices is identified with the [[renormalization]] freedom at each loop order (i.e. the choice of counter-terms).
