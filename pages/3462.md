'Profinite space' is another name for [[Stone space]], i.e., for a [[compact space|compact]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[connected space|totally disconnected]] [[topological space]].


##Risk of Confusion##

Just as the term 'space' is used by some schools of algebraic topologists as a synonym for [[simplicial set]], so 'profinite space' is sometimes used as meaning a 'simplicial object in the category of compact and totally disconnected topological spaces', i.e. in the other terminology a 'simplicial profinite space'.
