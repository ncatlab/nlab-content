## Definition

A [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ is called _reductive_ if the following equivalence conditions hold:

1. it is the [[direct sum]] $\mathfrak{g} \simeq \mathfrak{h} \oplus \mathfrak{a}$ of a [[semisimple Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{h}$ and an abelian Lie algebra $\mathfrak{a}$;

1. its [[adjoint representation]] is completely [[reducible representation|reducible]]: every invariant subspace has an invariant complement.

## Properties

* The graded algebra of [[invariant polynomial]]s on a reductive Lie algebra is the [[free construction|free]] graded algebra on the [[graded vector space]] of indecomposable invariant polynomials, and via [[transgression]] there generators are in bijection with the odd generators of the [[Lie algebra cohomology]].
