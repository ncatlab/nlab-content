#Idea#

The notion of _super smooth topos_ is to that of [[smooth topos]] as [[supergeometry]] is to [[differential geometry]].

The objects of a super smooth topos are generalizations of smooth [[supermanifold]]s that admit besides the usual odd infinitesimals of [[supergeometry]] also the even [[infinitesimal object]]s of [[synthetic differential geometry]].

The study of super smooth toposes is the content of [[synthetic differential supergeometry]]. (See there for references and details for the moment.)

# Definition #

A **super smooth topos** $(\mathcal{T}, R)$ is a [[smooth topos]] together with the refinement of the $k$-algebra structure on $R$ to that of a $k$-[[superalgebra]] structure.
