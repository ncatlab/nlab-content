##Idea

The _Kan extension_ of a [[functor]]
$F : C \to D$ with respect to a functor
$$
 \array{
  C
  \\
  \downarrow^p
  \\
  C'
 }
$$

is, if it exists, a "best approximation" to 
the problem of finding a functor $C' \to D$ such that 
$$
  \array{
     C &\stackrel{F}{\to}& D
     \\
     \downarrow^p & \nearrow
     \\
     C'
  }
  \,,
$$
i.e. to extending the domain of $F$ through $p$ from $C$ to $C'$.

More generally, this makes sense in any [[2-category]] other than [[Cat]].

Similarly, a [[Kan lift]] is the best approximation to lifting a morphism $F : C \to D$ through a morphism

$$
  \array{
    D'
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    D
  }
$$

to a morphism $\hat F$

$$
  \array{
    && D'
    \\
    & {}^{\hat F}\nearrow & \downarrow
    \\
    C &\stackrel{F}{\to}& D
  }
  \,.
$$


##Definitions

There are two definitions of Kan extensions, one of which is stronger than the other.

  When the stronger (or "pointwise") type of Kan extension exists, then it is also a Kan extension in the other (or "weak") sense, but a "weak" Kan extension can exist without being pointwise (see [below](#pointwiseVsWeak)).

* Ordinary, or "weak" Kan extensions, are given by adjoints to (or, more generally, universal transformations to/from) precomposition functors between functor categories.

* Strong, or "pointwise," Kan extensions, are computed at each input by a certain weighted (co)limit.

Kan extensions that are computed by limits and colimits are sometimes called **pointwise** Kan extensions, as in [[Categories Work]].  On the other hand, some authors (such as Kelly) assert that only pointwise Kan extensions deserve the name "Kan extension," and use a term such as "**weak** Kan extension" for a functor equipped with a universal natural transformation.  It is certainly true that most Kan extensions which arise in practice are pointwise.  This distinction is even more important in [[enriched category]] theory.


### Ordinary Kan extensions ##

Any functor $p : C \to C'$ induces, by precomposition, a functor between [[functor category|functor categories]]
$$
  p^*: G\mapsto G\circ p  : [C',D] \to [C,D]
  \,.
$$

(In some contexts, this functor might be called $p_*$; see "remark on terminology" below.)

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition
If $p^*$ has a [[left adjoint]], then this left adjoint is called **left Kan extension** along $p$ and denoted 
$$
  Lan = Lan_p : [C,D] \to [C',D]
  \,,
$$
The image $Lan_p(f)$ of some functor $f\colon C\to D$ is called *the left Kan extension of $f$ along $p$*.  Similarly, if $p^*$ has a [[right adjoint]], this right adjoint is called **right Kan extension** along $p$ and denoted
$$
  Ran = Ran_p: [C,D] \to [C',D]
  \,.
$$
=--

We may call this the *global* definition of Kan extension.  It clearly makes sense as stated in other contexts, such as in [[enriched category theory]].  Note that if $C' = 1$ is the [[terminal category]], then saying that the left (resp. right) Kan extension functor exists along $p$ is the same as saying that $D$ admits all [[colimits]] (resp. [[limits]]) of shape $C$.

There is also a *local* definition of "the Kan extension of a given functor $f$ along $p$" which can exist even if the entire functor defined above does not.  This is a generalization of the fact that a *particular* diagram of shape $C$ can have a limit even if not every such diagram does.  It is also a special case of the fact discussed at [[adjoint functor]] that an adjoint functor can fail to exist completely, but may still be partially defined.  If the local Kan extension of every single functor exists for some given $p\colon C\to C'$ and $D$, then these local Kan extensions fit together to define a functor which is the global Kan extension.

Thus, by the general notion of "partial adjoints," *the left Kan extension of $F\in [C,D]$ along $p$* should be a functor $Lan_p\,F:C'\to D$ equipped with a natural isomorphism
$$
Hom_{[C,D]}(F,p^*(-))\cong Hom_{[C',D]}(Lan_p\,F,-),
$$
i.e. a (co)representation of the functor $Hom_{[C,D]}(F,p^*(-))$.  The local definition of right Kan extensions along $p$ is dual.

As for adjoints and limits, by the usual logic of representable functors this can be rephrased as a "universal arrow."  Namely, [[generalized the|the]] left Kan extension $Lan F = Lan_p F$ of $F : C \to D$ along $p:C\to C'$ is a functor $Lan F : C' \to D$ equipped with a [[natural transformation]] $\eta_F : F \Rightarrow p^* Lan F$. 

<center markdown="1">[[kan-0.png:pic]]</center>

with the property that every other natural transformation
$F \Rightarrow p^* G$ factors uniquely through $\eta_F$ as

<center markdown="1">[[kan-1.png:pic]]</center>

Similarly for the right Kan extension, with the direction of the natural transformations reversed:

<center markdown="1">[[kan-2.png:pic]]</center>

By the usual reasoning (see e.g. [[Categories Work]], chapter IV, theorem 2), if these representations exist for every $F$ then they can be organised into a left (right) adjoint $Lan_p$ ($Ran_p$) to $p^*$.

It is clear that the definition in this form makes sense in every [[2-category]]. In slightly different terminology, the left Kan extension 1-cell $F:C\to D$ along a 1-cell $p\in K(C,C')$ in a 2-category $K$ is a pair $(Lan_p F,\alpha)$ where $\alpha : F\to Lan_p F\circ p$ is a 2-cell which reflects the object $F\in K(C,D)$ along the functor $p^* = K(p,D):K(C',D)\to K(C,D)$.


### Pointwise Kan extensions {#byColimits}

If $D$ admits certain [[limit|(co)limits]], then left and right Kan extensions can be computed in terms of these.  The requisite limits are most naturally expressed as [[weighted limits]], but in good cases they can be re-expressed in terms of [[end|(co)ends]] or conical colimits over [[comma categories]], which may be more familiar.

#### in terms of weighted (co)limits

Suppose given $F : C \to D$ and $p : C \to C'$ such that for every $c' \in C'$, the weighted limit
$$
  (Ran_p F)(c') \coloneqq lim^{C'(c',p(-))} F
  \,.
$$
exists.  Then these objects fit together into a functor $Ran_p F$ which is a right Kan extension of $F$ along $p$.  Dually, if the [[weighted limit|weighted colimit]]
$$
  (Lan_p F)(c') \coloneqq colim^{C'(p(-),c')} F
  \,.
$$
exists for all $c'$, then they fit together into a left Kan extension $Lan_p F$.  These definitions evidently make sense in the generality of $V$-[[enriched category theory]] for $V$ a [[closed monoidal category|closed]] [[symmetric monoidal category]].  (In fact, they can be modified slightly to make sense in the full generality of a [[2-category equipped with proarrows]].)

In particular, this means that if $C$ is [[small category|small] and $D$ is [[complete category|complete]] (resp. cocomplete), then all right (resp. left) Kan extensions of functors $F\colon C\to D$ exist along any functor $p\colon C\to C'$.


#### in terms of (co)ends {#byCoends}

If the $V$-[[enriched category]] $D$ is [[power]]ed over $V$, then the above weighted limit may be re-expressed in terms of an [[end]] as

$$
  (Ran_p F)(c') \simeq \int_{c \in C} C'(c',p(c))\pitchfork F(c')
  \,.
$$

So in particular when $D = V$ this is

$$
  (Ran_p F)(c') \simeq \int_{c \in C} [C'(c',p(c)),F(c')]
  \,.
$$


Similarly, if $D$ is [[copower|tensored]] over $V$, then the left Kan extension is given by a [[coend]].

$$
  (Lan_p F)(c') \simeq \int^{c \in C} C'(p(c),c')\otimes F(c')
  \,.
$$

#### in terms of conical colimits

In the special case that $V = Set$, and only then, there is an expression of a weighted (co)limit and hence a Kan extension as a (co)limit over a [[comma category]].  Namely, the right Kan extension of a functor of ordinary categories is given by the [[limit]]
$$
    (Ran_p F)(c')
      \simeq lim \left((const_{c'}/p) \to C \stackrel{F}{\to} D\right)
  \,,
$$
if it exists for all $c'$.  Likewise, the left Kan extension of a functor of ordinary categories is given by the [[colimit]]
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    (Lan_p F)(c')
      \simeq colim \left((p/const_{c'}) \to C \stackrel{F}{\to} D\right)
  \end{aligned}
$$
if it exists for all $c'$.  Here $(const_{c'}/p)$ and $(p/const_{c'})$ are [[comma category|comma categories]] in the notation described there.


### Comparing the definitions   {#pointwiseVsWeak}

Not all Kan extensions in the universal-transformation sense defined above are _pointwise_ Kan extensions, i.e. computed as weighted (co)limits.  Non-pointwise Kan extensions can exist even when $D$ does not admit very many limits.  For instance, the Kan extensions that arise in the study of [[derived functor]]s are not pointwise.

The upshot is that if a pointwise extension exists then it is the same as the corresponding non-pointwise extension, but the converse does not always hold.  Instead a non-pointwise extension is pointwise if and only if it is preserved by all representable functors ([[Categories Work]], theorem X.5.3).


### in $(\infty,1)$-categories 

The global definition of Kan extensions for
$(\infty,1)$-functors in terms of left/right adjoints to pullbacks may be interpreted essentially verbatim in the context of [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categories]] using the corresponding notion of [[limit in quasi-categories]].

Details are in [section 4.3, p. 215](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/math/pdf/0608/0608040v4.pdf#page=215)  of [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT]].


## Examples

* For $C' = $ the [[point]], the right Kan extension of $F$ is the [[limit]] of $F$, $Ran F \simeq \lim F$ and the left Kan extension is the [[colimit]] $Lan F \simeq colim F$.

* For $f : X \to Y$ a [[site|morphism of sites]] coming from a functor $f^t : S_Y \to S_X$ of the underlying categories, the left Kan extension of functors along $f^t$ is the [[inverse image]] operation $f^{-1} : PSh(Y) \to PSh(X)$.

* see also [[examples of Kan extensions]]

### Restriction and extension of sheaves 

For more on the following see also 

* [[restriction and extension of sheaves]]

The basic example for left Kan extensions using the above pointwise formula, is in the construction of the pullback of sheaves along a morphism of topological spaces. Let $f:X\to Y$ be a continuous map and $F$ a presheaf over $X$. Then the formula $(f_* F)(U) = F(f^{-1}(U))$ clearly defines a presheaf $f_* F$ on $Y$, which is in fact a sheaf if $F$ is.
On the other hand, given a presheaf $G$ over $Y$ we can not
define pullback presheaf $(f^{-1} G)(V)=G(f(V))$ because $f(V)$ might not be open in general (unless $f$ is an open map). For Grothendieck sites such $f(V)$ would not make even sense. But one can consider approximating from above by $G(W)$ for all $W\supset f(V)$ which are open and take a colimit of this diagram of inclusions (all $W$ are bigger, so getting down to the lower bound means going reverse to the direction of inclusions). But inclusion $f(V)\subset W$ implies $V\subset f^{-1}(f(V))\subset f^{-1}(W)$. The latter identity $V\subset f^{-1}(W)$ involves _only open sets_. Thus we take a colimit over the comma category $(V\downarrow f^{-1})$ of $G$. If $G$ is a sheaf, the colimit $G(V)$ understood as a rule $V\mapsto G(V)$ is still not a sheaf, we need to [[sheafification|sheafify]]. The result is sheaf-theoretic pullback 
$$
f^{-1}G = \mathrm{sheafify}(V\mapsto\mathrm{colim}_{V\hookrightarrow f^{-1}W} G(W)) = \mathrm{sheafify}(V\mapsto\mathrm{colim}_{(V\downarrow f^{-1})} G)
$$ 
which is a sheaf, and one can analyze this construction to show that $f^{-1}$ is a left adjoint to $f_*$. This usage of left Kan extension persists in the more general case of Grothendieck topologies. 



## Remark on terminology: pushforward vs. pullback

Generally, for $p : C \to C'$ a [[functor]], the induced "precomposition" functor on [[functor category|functor categories]]
$$
  [C', D] \stackrel{- \circ p}{\to}
  [C,D]
$$
is spoken of as _pulling back_ a functor on $C'$ to a functor on $C$, as this operation goes in the direction opposite to that of $p$ itself.  For this reason, we have above denoted this functor by $p^*$.  Likewise, one might call the (left or right) Kan extensions along $p$ a _push forward_ of functors from $C$ to functors on $C'$.

This notation also coincides with that for [[geometric morphisms]] in one case: any functor $p\colon C\to C'$ between small categories induces a geometric morphism $[C,Set] \to [C',Set]$ of [[presheaf topos|presheaf toposes]], whose [[inverse image]] is the above $p^*$ and whose [[direct image]] $p_*$ is the right Kan extension functor.  Note that $p^*$ preserves (finite) limits, as required of an inverse image functor, since it has a left adjoint, namely *left* Kan extension.

On the other hand, if $p$ is additionally a [[flat functor]], then the above precomposition functor is also the *direct* image of a geometric morphism, whose inverse image is given by *left* Kan extension (which preserves finite limits when $p$ is flat).  More generally, if $C^{op}$ and $(C')^{op}$ are [[sites]] and $p^{op}\colon C^{op}\to (C')^{op}$ is flat and preserves covering families (i.e. it is a [[morphism of sites]]), then precomposition is the direct image of a geometric morphism $Sh(C^{op})\to Sh((C')^{op})$ between sheaf toposes.

For example, $C^{op}$ and $(C')^{op}$ might be the [[posets]] $Open(X)$ and $Open(X')$ of open subsets of [[topological spaces]] (or [[locales]]) $X$ and $X'$ and inclusions, in which case
$$
  Open(X)^{op} \to Open(X')^{op}
$$ 
come from continuous maps of topological spaces going the other way
$$
  X \leftarrow X' : f
  \,,
$$
via the usual inverse image $f^{-1} : O(X)^{op} \to O(X')^{op}$ of open subsets.

Thus, in such cases, the functor $p^*$, which looks like a pullback of functors along $p = f^{-1}$, corresponds geometrically to a _push-forward_ of (pre)sheaves along $f$.  Therefore, in [[presheaf]] literature (such as [[Categories and Sheaves]]) the precomposition functor induced by $p$ is usually denoted $p_*$ and not $p^*$.

It is however noteworthy that also the opposite perspective does occur in geometrically motivated examples. For instance 

* if $C$ is the [[discrete category]] on smooth space and $D = U(1)$ is the discrete category on the smooth space $X$ underlying the Lie group $U(1)$, then smooth functors (i.e. functors [[internal category|internal to]] [[generalized smooth space|smooth spaces]]) $F : C \to D$ can be identified with smooth $U(1)$-valued functions on $X$, and the functor on these functor categories induced by a smooth functor $p : C \to C'$ does correspond to the familiar notion of _pullback_ of functions;

* and similar in higher degrees: if $C = P_1(X)$ is the smooth path groupoid of a smooth space and $D = \mathbf{B} U(1)$ the smooth [[group]] $U(1)$ regarded as a one-object [[Lie groupoid]], then smooth functors $C \to D$ correspond to smooth 1-forms $\in \Omega^1(X)$ on $X$, and precomposition with a smooth functor $p : P_1(X) \to P_1(X')$ corresponds to the familiar notion of _pullback_ of 1-forms.

This means that whether or not Kan extension corresponds geometrically to pushforward or to pullback depends on the way (covariant or contravariant) in which the domain categories $C$, $C'$ are identified with geometric entities.
