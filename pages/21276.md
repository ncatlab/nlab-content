## Idea


A [[spacetime]] is called _stationary_ if it admits a [[Killing vector field]] which is [[timelike]].

If the spacetime in addition is irrotational (...) it is called a _[[static spacetime]]_.

## Properties

### Ehlers transformation

An _[[Ehlers transformation]]_ is a transformation that [[action|acts]] on the parameters of [[static spacetimes]] solving the [[Einstein field equations]] and generates other solutions of the field equations that are in general [[stationary spacetimes]].
