## Idea

Serre functors were introduced by [[Aleksei Bondal]] and [[Mikhail Kapranov]] to study [[admissible subcategories]] of [[triangulated categories]].  A **Serre functor** on a triangulated category $\mathcal{A}$ is an exact functor such that for any objects $A$ and $B$, $\Hom(A,B) \simeq \Hom(B, S(A))^*$.  It does not always exist, but when it does it is unique up to graded natural isomorphism.

The Serre functor is a powerful tool for working with the [[derived category]] of [[coherent sheaves]] on a variety.

## Definition

In the original paper, the following definition was given.

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition
Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a $k$-linear triangulated category with finite-dimensional [[Hom]]'s and $k$ algebraically closed.  A **Serre functor** $S : \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{A}$ is an additive equivalence that commutes with the translation functor, with bi-functorial isomorphisms $\phi_{A,B} : \Hom_\mathcal{A}(A,B) \stackrel{\sim}{\to} \Hom_{\mathcal{A}}(B,S(A))^*$ for any objects $A$ and $B$, such that the composite
  \[ (\phi^{-1}_{S(A),S(B)})^* \circ \phi_{A,B} : \Hom(A,B) \to \Hom(B,S(A))^* \to \Hom(S(A), S(B)) \]
coincides with the isomorphism induced by $S$.
=--

In fact, the last commutativity condition can be deduced from just the bi-functoriality of $\phi_{A,B}$, and commutativity with the translation functor also follows from a proposition below.  Hence, the following definition is seen in later papers.

###### Definition
Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a $k$-linear category with finite-dimensional [[Hom]]'s and $k$ an arbitrary field.  A **Serre functor** $S : \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{A}$ is an additive equivalence with bi-functorial isomorphisms $\phi_{A,B} : \Hom_\mathcal{A}(A,B) \stackrel{\sim}{\to} \Hom_{\mathcal{A}}(B,S(A))^*$ for any objects $A$ and $B$.

Of course, formally the definition could be used in categories enriched over a symmetric monoidal category with a sufficiently nice involution.

## Examples

###### Example
In the [[derived category]] of [[finite-dimensional vector spaces]] over $k$, the identity functor is a Serre functor.

###### Example
In the derived category of [[coherent sheaves]] on a smooth projective [[variety]] $X$, the functor $(\cdot \otimes \omega_X)[n]$ is a Serre functor, in view of [[Serre-Grothendieck duality]], where $\omega_X$ is the [[canonical sheaf]] and $n$ is the dimension of $X$.

## Properties

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition
Any autoequivalence $F : \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{A}$ commutes with a Serre functor: there is a natural graded isomorphism of functors $F \circ S \stackrel{\sim}{\to} S \circ F$.
=--

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition
Any Serre functor in a [[graded category]] is [[graded]].
=--

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition
Any Serre functor in a [[triangulated category]] is [[exact]] (i.e. [[distinguished triangles]] are mapped to distinguished triangles).
=--

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition
Any two Serre functors are connected by a canonical graded functorial isomorphism that commutes with the isomorphisms $\phi_{A,B}$ in the definition of the Serre functor.
