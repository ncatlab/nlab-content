## Idea

The notion of **2-topos** is the generalization of the notion of [[topos]] from [[category theory]] to the [[higher category theory]] of [[2-categories]].  

There are multiple conceivable such generalizations, depending in particular on whether one tries to generalize the notion of [[Grothendieck topos]] or of [[elementary topos]], and in the latter case what axioms one chooses to take as the basis for generalization.

In contrast, [[(n,1)-topos|(2,1)-toposes]] are much better understood.

A _Grothendieck 2-topos_ is a [[2-category]] of [[2-sheaves]] over a [[2-site]].

A _Grothendieck (2,1)-topos_ is a [[(2,1)-category]] of [[(2,1)-sheaves]] over a [[(2,1)-site]].

See also [[higher topos theory]].

## Examples

### The archetypical 2-topos

The archetypical 2-topos is [[Cat]]. This plays the role for 2-toposes as [[Set]] does for [[1-toposes]].

### Internal categories in a $(2,1)$-topos

Given any [[(2,1)-topos]] $\mathcal{X}$, the [[2-category]] $Cat(\mathcal{X})$ of [[internal (infinity,1)-category|internal categories]] in $\mathcal{X}$ ought to be a 2-topos. But it seems that at the moment there is no proof of this in the literature.

For literature on [[internal categories]] in [[1-toposes]] see at _[[2-sheaf]]_.
