## Idea

A _topological vector bundle_ is a [[vector bundle]] in the context of _[[topology]]_: a continuously varying collection of [[vector space]] over a given [[topological space]].

## Definition

We first give the more abstract definiton 
in terms of slice categories (def. \ref{TopologicalVectorBundleInTermsOfSliceCategories} below) and then unwind this to the traditional definition (def \ref{TopologicalVectorBundle} below).

For definiteness, in the following by _[[vector space]]_ we mean _[[real vector space|real]] [[finite dimensional vector space]]_. The generalization to other [[topological fields|topological]] [[ground field]] such as the [[complex numbers]] is immediate.

###### Definition
**(topological vector bundles in terms of slice categories)**

Write [[Top]] for the [[category]] of [[topological spaces]], and for $X \in Top$ a space, write $Top_{/X}$ for its [[slice category]] over $X$. The [[Cartesian product]] in $Top_{/X}$ is the [[fiber product]] over $X$ in $Top$, which we denote by $(-) \times_X (-)$.

A _topological vector bundle_ over $X \in Top$ is
 
1. an [[object ]] $[E \overset{\pi}{\to} X]$ of $Top_{/X}$ 

1. with the [[structure]] of a [[vector space]]-object [[internalization|interal]] to $Top_{/X}$, hence 

   1. a [[morphism]] $ (-)+(-) \;\colon\; E \times_X E \to E$ 

   1. a morphism $(-)\cdot(-) \;\colon\; \mathbb{R} \times E \to E$ 

   which satisfy the vector space axioms 

such that 

* ([[local trivialization|local triviality]]) there exists 

  1. an [[open cover]] $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$, regarded via the [[disjoint union space]] $U \coloneqq \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} U_i$ of the patches as the object $ [U \to X] \in Top_{/X}$,

  1. an [[isomorphism]] of vector space objects in $Top_{/U}$ 

     $$
       U \times \mathbb{R}^n 
         \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
       U \times_X E
       \,,
     $$

     for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$, where  $[U \times \mathbb{R}^n \overset{pr_1}{\to} X]$ and $[U \times_X E \overset{pr_1}{\to} U]$ are regarded as a vector space objects in $Top_{U}$ in the canonical way.

It follows that $n \in \mathbb{N}$ is constant on [[connected components]]. Often this is required to be constant on all of $X$ and then called the _[[rank]]_ of the vector bundle.

A _[[homomorphism]]_ of topological vector bundles is simple a homomorphism of vector space objects in $Top_{/X}$.

Topological vector bundles over $X$ and homomorphisms between them constitutes a [[category]], usually denoted [[Vect(X)]].

=--     

Notice that viewed in [[Top]], the last condition means that there is a [[diagram]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    U \times \mathbb{R}^n
      &\overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}&
    U \times_X E
      &\overset{}{\longrightarrow}&
    E
    \\
    & \searrow & \downarrow &(pb)& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\pi}}
    \\
    && U &\longrightarrow& X
  }
$$

where the square is a [[pullback square]] and the [[homeomorphism]] in the top left is fiber-wise linear. 

If we say this yet more explicitly, it yields the definition as found in the traditional textbooks:

+-- {: .num_defn #TopologicalVectorBundle}
###### Definition
**(topological vector bundle in components)**

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]]. Then a _topological vector bundle_ over $X$ is

1. a [[topological space]] $E$;

1. a [[continuous function]] $E \overset{\pi}{\to} X$

1. for each $x \in X$ the stucture of a [[real vector space]] on the [[pre-image]] 

   $$E_x \coloneqq \pi^{-1}(\{x\}) \subset E$$

such that there exists 

1. an [[open cover]] $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$,

1. for each $i \in I$ a [[homeomorphism]]

   $$
     \phi_i \;\colon\; U_i \times \mathbb{R}^n \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} \pi^{-1}(U_i) \subset E
   $$

   from the [[product topological space]] of $U_i$ with the [[real numbers]] (equipped with their [[Euclidean space]] [[metric topology]]) to the restriction of $E$ over $U_i$, such that 

   1. $\phi_i$ is a map over $U_i$ in that $\pi \circ \phi_i = pr_1$, hence in that $\phi_i(\{x\} \times \mathbb{R}^n) \subset \pi^{-1}(\{x\})$

   1. $\phi_i$ is a [[linear map]] in each fiber in that

      $$
        \underset{x \in U_i \cap U_j}{\forall}
        \left(
          \phi_i(x) \;\colon\; 
             \mathbb{R}^n \overset{\text{linear}}{\longrightarrow}
            E_x = \pi^{-1}(\{x\})
        \right)
        \,.
      $$

For $[E_1 \overset{\pi_1}{\to} X]$ and $[E_2 \overset{\phi_2}{\to} X]$ two topological vector bundles over the same base space, then a _[[homomorphism]]_ 
between them is

* a [[continuous function]] $f \colon E_1 \longrightarrow E_2$

such that 

1. $f$ respects the [[projections]]: $\pi_2 \circ f = \pi_1$;

1. for each $x \in X$ we have that $f|_x \colon (E_1)_x \to (E_2)_x$ is a [[linear map]].

###### Remark

For $X$ a [[topological space]], there is the [[category]] whose

* [[objects]] are the topological vector bundles over $X$,

* [[morphisms]] are the topological vector bundle homomorphisms

according to def. \ref{TopologicalVectorBundle}. This category usually denoted [[Vect(X)]].

+-- {: .num_example #TrivialTopologicalVectorBundle}
###### Example
**(trivial topological vector bundle and (local) trivialization)**

For $X$ any [[topological space]], and $n \in \mathbb{N}$,
we have that the [[product topological space]]

$$
  X \times \mathbb{R}^n \overset{pr_1}{\to} X
$$ 

canonically becomes a topological vector bundle over $X$ (def. \ref{TopologicalVectorBundle}). This is called the _[[trivial vector bundle]]_ of [[rank]] $n$ over $X$.

Given any topological vector bundle $E \to X$, then a choice of [[isomorphism]] to a trivial bundle (if it exists)

$$
  E \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} X \times \mathbb{R}^n
$$

is called a _trivialization_ of $E$.

Accordingly, the [[local trivialization|local triviality]] condition in the definition of topological vector bundles (def. \ref{TopologicalVectorBundle}) says that they are locally isomorphic to the trivial vector bundle. One also says that the data consisting of an open cover $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ and the [[homeomorphisms]]

$$
  \left\{
     U_i \times \mathbb{R}^n
       \overset{\simeq}{\to}
     E|_{U_i}
  \right\}_{i \in I}
$$

as in def. \ref{TopologicalVectorBundle} constitute a _[[local trivialization]]_ of $E$.

+-- {: .num_example #TopologicalVetorSubbundle}
###### Example
**(topological vector sub-bundle)**

Given a topological vector bundel $E \to X$ (def. \ref{TopologicalVectorBundle}), then a _sub-bundle_ is a homomorphism of topological vector bundles over $X$

$$
  i\;\colon\; E' \hookrightarrow E
$$

such that for each point $x \in X$ this is a linear embedding of fibers

$$
  i|_x \;\colon\; E'_x \hookrightarrow E_x
  \,.
$$

(This is a [[monomorphism]] in the [[category]] $Vect(X)$ of topological vector bundles over $X$.)

+-- {: .num_defn #TransitionFunctions}
###### Definition
**([[transition functions]])

Given a topological vector bundle $E \to X$ as in def. \ref{TopologicalVectorBundle} and a choice of local trivialization isomorphisms $\{\phi_i \colon U_i \times \mathbb{R}^n \overset{\simeq}{\to} E|_{U_i}\}$ (example \ref{TrivialTopologicalVectorBundle}) induce [[continuous functions]] 

$$
  \left\{
    g_{i j} \;\colon\; (U_i \cap U_j) \longrightarrow GL(n, \mathbb{R})
  \right\}_{i,j \in I}
$$

with values in the [[general linear group]] $GL(n, \mathbb{R})$

$$
  \array{
    (U_i \cap U_j) \times \mathbb{R}^n
      &\overset{\phi_j \circ \phi_i^{-1}}{\longrightarrow}&
    (U_i \cap U_j) \times \mathbb{R}^n
    \\
    (x,v) &\overset{\phantom{AAA}}{\mapsto}& (x, g_{i j}(x)(v))
  }
  \,.
$$ 

These are called the _[[transition functions]]_ for the given local trivialization.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark #CechCoycleCondition}
###### Remark
**(Cech cocycle condition)**

Let $E \to X$ be a topological vector bundle (def. \ref{TopologicalVectorBundle}) and let $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$, $\{\phi_i \colon U_i \times \mathbb{R}^n \overset{\simeq}{\to} E|_{U_{i}}\}_{i \in I}$ be a local trivialization (example \ref{TrivialTopologicalVectorBundle}).

Then the induced [[transition functions]] $\{g_{i j} \colon U_i \cap U_j \to GL(n)\}$ (def. \ref{TransitionFunctions}) satisfy for all $i,j,k \in I$ the conditions

$$
  g_{i i} = id
  \phantom{AAA}
  \text{and}
  \phantom{AAA}
  g_{i j} \circ g_{j k} 
    = 
  g_{i k} 
  \phantom{AA}
  \text{on}\, U_i \cap U_j \cap U_k
  \,.
$$

These are the condition of a [[cocycle]] in degree 1 in [[Cech cohomology]] on $X$ with [[coefficients]] in the [[sheaf]] $\underline{GL(n)}$ of $GL(n)$-valued [[continuous functions]].

=--

Conversely:

+-- {: .num_example #TopologicalVectorBundleFromCechCocycle}
###### Example
**(topological vector bundle from a Cech coycle)

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]] and let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ be a [[natural number]]. Consider an [[open cover]] of $X$

$$
  \{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}
$$

and on each double intersection a [[continuous function]] with values in the [[general linear group]] $GL(n)$

$$
  \left\{
    g_{i j} 
      \;\colon\;
    U_i \cap U_j
      \to
    GL(n)
  \right\}
$$

such that for all $i,j,k \in I$ the conditions

$$
  g_{i i} = id
  \phantom{AAA}
  \text{and}
  \phantom{AAA}
  g_{i j} \circ g_{j k} 
    = 
  g_{i k} 
  \phantom{AA}
  \text{on}\, U_i \cap U_j \cap U_k
$$

hold (hence consider a [[Cech cohomology]] 1-[[cocycle]] on $X$ with [[coefficients]] in $\underline{GL(n)}$, remark \ref{CechCoycleCondition}).

This induces an [[equivalence relation]] on the [[product topological space]]

$$
  \left(
    \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} U_i
  \right)
  \times
  \mathbb{R}^n
$$

(of the [[disjoint union space]] of the patches $U_i \subset X$ regarded as [[topological subspaces]] with the [[Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ with its [[metric topology]]) given by

$$
  \big(
    ((x,i), v)
     \;\sim\;
    ((x,j), w)
  \big)
   \;\Leftrightarrow\;
  \left(
     g_{i j}(x)(v) = w
  \right)
  \,.
$$

Write

$$
  E 
   \;\coloneqq\;
  \left(
    \left(
      \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} U_i
    \right)
      \times
    \mathbb{R}^n
  \right)
  /
  \left(
     \left\{
        g_{i j}
     \right\}_{i,j \in I}
  \right)
$$

for the resulting [[quotient topological space]]. This comes with the evident projection

$$
  \array{
    E &\overset{\phantom{AA}\pi \phantom{AA}}{\longrightarrow}& X
    \\
    ((x,i,),v) &\overset{\phantom{AAA}}{\mapsto}& x
  }
$$

which is a [[continuous function]] (by the [[universal property]] of the [[quotient topological space]] construction, since this [[function]] respects the equivalence relation). Moreover, each [[fiber]] of this map is identified with $\mathbb{R}^n$, and hence canonicaly carries the structure of a [[vector space]].

Finally, a local trivialization of $E$ exists over the original cover, by construction.

Therefore this is a topological vector bundle (def. \ref{TopologicalVectorBundle}). We say it is the topological vector bundle _glued from the transition functions_.

In fact extracting transition functions from a vector bundle by def. \ref{TransitionFunctions} and constructing a vector bundle from Cech coycle data as above are operations that are inverse to each other, up to [[isomorphism]].

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Stated more [[category theory|category theoretically]], the constructure of a topological vector bundle from Cech cocycle data in example \ref{TopologicalVectorBundleFromCechCocycle} is a [universal construction in topological spaces](Top#UniversalConstructions), namely the [[coequalizer]] of the two morphisms

$$i, \mu: \underset{i j}{\sqcup} (U_i \cap U_j) \times V \overset{\to}{\to} \underset{i}{\sqcup} U_i \times V$$ 

in the category of vector space objects in the slice category $Top/X$. Here the restriction of $i$ to the coproduct summands is induced by inclusion: 

$$(U_i \cap U_j) \times V \hookrightarrow U_i \times V \hookrightarrow \underset{i}{\sqcup} U_i \times V$$ 

and the restriction of $\mu$ to the coproduct summands is 
via the action of the transition functions: 

$$(U_i \cap U_j) \times V \overset{(\langle incl, g_{i j} \rangle) \times V}{\to} U_j \times GL(V) \times V \overset{action}{\to} U_j \times V \hookrightarrow \underset{j}{\sqcup} U_j \times V$$

## Properties

### Direct summand bundles
 {#DirectSummandBundles}

We discuss properties of the [[direct sum of vector bundles]] for topological vector bundles.

+-- {: .num_prop #TopologicalSubBundlesOverParacompactHausdorffSpacesAreDirectSummands}
###### Proposition
**(sub-bundles over [[paracompact spaces]] are [[direct sum of vector bundles|direct summands]])**

Let 

1. $X$ be a [[paracompact Hausdorff space]],

1. $E \to X$ a [[topological vector bundle]] (def. \ref{TopologicalVectorBundle}). 

Then every topological vector sub-bundle $E_1 \hookrightarrow E$ (example \ref{TopologicalVetorSubbundle}) is a direct vector bundle summand, in that there exists another vector sub-bundle $E_2 \hookrightarrow E$ (example \ref{TopologicalVetorSubbundle}) such that their [[direct sum of vector bundles]] is $E$:

$$
  E_1 \oplus E_2 \simeq E
  \,.
$$

=--

([e.g. Hatcher, prop. 1.3](#Hatcher))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Since $X$ is assumed to be paracompact Hausdorff, there exists a [[inner product of vector bundles]]

$$
  \langle -,-\rangle
  \;\colon\;
  E \oplus_X E 
    \longrightarrow
  X \times \mathbb{R}
$$

(by [this prop.](inner+product+of+vector+bundles#ExistenceOfInnerProductOfTopologicalVectorBundlesOverParacompactHausdorffSpaces)). This defines at each $x \in X$ the [[orthogonal complement]] $(E'_x)^\perp \subset E_x$ of $E'_x \hookrightarrow E$. The [[subspace]] of these orthogonal complements is readily checked to be a [[topological vector bundle]] $(E')^\perp \to X$. Hence by construction we have

$$
  E \;\simeq\; E' \oplus_X (E')^\perp
  \,.

###### Proposition
**(vector bundles over a [[compact Hausdorff space]] are [[direct sum of vector bundles|direct summands]] of a [[trivial vector bundle]])**

Let 

1. $X$ be a [[compact Hausdorff space]];

1. $E \to X$ a [[topological vector bundle]] (def. \ref{TopologicalVectorBundle}).

Then there exists another topological vector bundle $\tilde E \to X$ such that the [[direct sum of vector bundles]] of the two is a [[trivial vector bundle]] $X \times \mathbb{R}^n$:

$$
  E \oplus \tilde E
   \;\simeq\;
  X \times \mathbb{R}^n
  \,.
$$

=--

(e.g. [Hatcher, prop. 1.4](#Hatcher), [Friedlander, ptop. 3.1](#Friedlander))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ be an [[open cover]] of $X$ over which $E \to X$ has a [[local trivialization]]

$$
  \left\{
    \phi_i
      \;\colon\;
     U_i \times \mathbb{R}^n
       \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
     E\vert_{U_i}
  \right\}_{i \in I}
  \,.
$$

By compactness of $X$, there is a [[finite cover|finite sub-cover]], hence a [[finite set]] $J \subset I$ such tat 

$$
  \{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in J \subset I}
$$

is still an open cover over which $E$ trivializes.

Since [[paracompact Hausdorff spaces equivalently admit subordinate partitions of unity]] there exists a [[partition of unity]]

$$
  \left\{
    f_i \;\colon\; X \to [0,1]
  \right\}_{i \in J}
$$

with [[support]] $supp(f_i) \subset U_i$. Hence the functions

$$
  \array{
    E\vert_{U_i} 
     &\overset{\phantom{AAAA}}{\longrightarrow}&
    U_i \times \mathbb{R}^n
    \\
    v 
       &\overset{\phantom{AAA}}{\mapsto}&
    f_i(x) \cdot \phi_i^{-1}(v)
  }
$$

extend by 0 to vector bundle homomorphism of the form

$$
  f_i \cdot \phi^{-1}_i
  \;\colon\;
  E
    \longrightarrow
  X \times \mathbb{R}^n
  \,.
$$

The finite pointwise [[direct sum]] of these yields a vector bundle homomorphism
of the form

$$
  \underset{i \in J}{\oplus} f_i \cdot \phi_i
  \;\colon\;
  E
    \longrightarrow
  X \times \left( 
    \underset{i \in J}{\oplus}
       \mathbb{R}^n
  \right)
  \simeq
  X \times \mathbb{R}^{n \dot {\vert J\vert}}
  \,.
$$

Observe that, as opposed to the single $f_i \cdot \phi^{-1}_i$, this is a fiber-wise injective, because at each point at least one of the $f_i$ is non-vanishing. Hence this is an injection of $E$ into a trivial vector bundle. 

With this the statement follows by prop. \ref{TopologicalSubBundlesOverParacompactHausdorffSpacesAreDirectSummands}.

Prop. \ref{OverCompactHausdorffSpacesEveryTopologicalVectorBundleIsDirectSummandOfATrivialBundle} is key for the construction of [[topological K-theory]] groups on compact Hausdorff spaces.

### Concordance
 {#ConcordanceOfTopolgicslVectorBundles}

We discuss that every [[concordance]] of topological vector bundles over a [[paracompact topological space]] makes the restriction of the vector bundle over the endpoints of the interval isomorphic (prop. \ref{ConcondanceOfTopologicalVectorBundles} below). In particular this implies tht the [[pullbacks of vector bundles]] along two [[homotopy|homotopic]] [[continuous functions]] are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] (corollary \ref{PullbackOfvectorBundlesAlongHomotopicMapsAreIsomorphic} below). The proof below follows [Hatcher, theorem 1.6](#Hatcher).

For $X$ a [[topological space]] write $X \times I$ for the [[product topological space]] with the [[closed interval]] $[0,1]$ equipped with its [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] [[metric topology]]. 

Write

$$

+-- {: .num_lemma #CoverForProductSpaceWithIntrval}
###### Lemma

For $X$ a [[topological space]], then for every topological vector bundle $E \to X \times I$ there exists an [[open cover]] $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ of $X$ such that the vector bundle trivializes over $U_i \times [0,1] \subset X \times [0,1]$, for each $i \in I$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By [[local trivialization|local trvializability]] of the vector bundle, there exists an open cover $\{V_j \subset X \times I\}_{j \in J}$ over which the bundle trivializes. For each point $x \in X$ this induces a cover of $\{x\} \times [0,1]$. This is a [[compact topological space]] (for instance by the [[Heine-Borel theorem]]) and hence there exists a [[finite set|finite]] [[subset]] $J_x \subset I$ such that $\{V_i \subset X\}_{i \in J_x}$ still covers $\{x\} \times [0,1]$. 

By finiteness of $J_x$, the [[intersection]]

$$
  U_x \coloneqq \underset{i \in J_x}{\cap} p_X(V_i)
$$

is an open neighbourhood of $x$ in $X$. Moreover

$$
  \{ p_{[0,1]}(V_i) \subset I \}_{i \in J_x}
$$

is an open cover of $[0,1]$ such that the given vector bundle trivializes over each element of $\{V_x \times p_{[0,1]}(U_i)\}_{i \in J_x}$.

By the nature of the Euclidean [[metric topology]] each [[open subset]] of $[0,1]$ is a union of intervals. So we may pass to a [[refinement]] of this cover of $[0,1]$ such that each element is a single interval. Again by compactness of $[0,1]$, this refinement has a finite subcover

$$
  \{W_{x,k} \subset [0,1]\}_{k \in K_x}
$$

each element of which is an [[interval]]. Since this is a finite cover, we may find numbers $\{0 = t_0 \lt t_1 \lt t_2 \lt \cdots \lt t_{n_x} = 1\}$ such that 

$$
  \{ [t_k, t_{k+1}] \subset [0,1] \}_{0 \leq k \lt n_x}
$$

is a cover of $[0,1]$, and such that the given vector bundle still trivializes over $V_x \times [t_k, t_{k+1}]$ for all $0 \leq k \lt n_x$.

By lemma \ref{TrivilizationOfVectorBundleOverProductSpaceWithInterval} this implies that the vector bundle in fact trivializes over $U_x \times [0,1]$.

Applying this procedure for all points $x \in X$ yields a cover 

$$
  \{ U_x \subset X  \}_{x \in X}
$$

with the required property.

such that each element is a [[disjoint union]] of open subsets that each are contained in one of the $U_i$. This means that the vector bundle $E$ still trivializes over $V_n \times [0,1]$, for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

Moreover, since [[paracompact Hausdorff spaces equivalently admit subordinate partitions of unity]], there exists a [[partition of unity]] $\{f_n \colon X \to [0,1] \}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ subordinate to this countable cover.

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ define

$$
  \psi_n \coloneqq \underoverset{k = 0}{n}{\sum} f_n
$$

(so $\psi_0 = 0$ and by local finiteness there is for each $x \in X$ an $n_x$ such that $\psi_{n \gt n_x} = 1$.)

Now write

$$
  X_n \coloneqq graph( \psi_n ) \subset X \times [0,1]
$$

for the [[graph]] of the function $\psi_n$ equipped with its [[subspace topology]], and write 

$$
  E_n 
   \coloneqq
  \psi_n^\ast E
$$ 

for the restriction of $E$ to that subspace.

Observe that the projection functions

$$
  \array{
    X_{n+1} &\overset{}{\longrightarrow}& X_n
    \\
    (x,\psi_{n+1}(x)) &\overset{\phantom{AA}}{\mapsto}& (x, \psi_n(x))
  }
$$

are continuous. Since, by construction, these projections are non-trivial only on the [[support]] of $f_{n+1}$, and since $E$ is trivial on that support, they induce vector bundle isomorphisms of the form

$$
  h_n 
    \;\colon\; 
  E_{n+1} \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} E_n
  \,.
$$

By local finiteness, each point $x \in X$ has a neighbourhood $U_x$ such that only a finite number $n_x$ of these $h_n$ are non-trivial, and so it makes sense to consider the infinite composition

$$
  h_1 \circ h_2 \circ h_3 \circ \cdots
$$

understood to be on each $U_x$ the finite composite

$$
  h_1 \circ \cdots \circ h_{n_x}
  \,.
$$

Since all the $h_k$ are vector bundle isomorphisms, so are all their composites. But the infintie composite is now a morphism, hence an isomorphism, of the required form

$$
  E|_{X \times \{0\}}
   \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  E|_{X \times \{1\}}
  \,.
$$

###### Corollary

Let $X$ be a [[paracompact Hausdorff space]], let $E \to Y$ be a topological [[vector bundle]], let $f,g \colon X \to Y$ be two [[continuous functions]], and let $\eta \colon f \to g$ be a [[left homotopy]] between them. Then there is an [[isomorphism]] of vector bundles over $X$ between the [[pullback of vector bundles]] of $E$ along $f$ and along $g$, respectively:

$$
  f^\ast E \simeq g^\ast E
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By definition, the [[left homotopy]] $\eta$ is a [[continuous function]] of the form

$$
  \eta
  \;\colon\;
  X \times [0,1] \longrightarrow Y
  \,.
$$

For $t \in [0,1]$ write $i_t$ for the continuous function

$$
  \array{
     X &\overset{\phantom{AA}i_t\phantom{AA}}{\longrightarrow}& X \times [0,1]
     \\
     x &\overset{\phantom{AAAA}}{\mapsto}& (x,t)
  }
  \,.
$$

By the [[pasting law]] for pullbacks we have that 

$$
  f^\ast E = (\eta \circ i_0)^\ast E
  \simeq i_0^\ast (\eta^\ast E) \simeq (\eta^\ast E)|_{X \times \{0\}}
$$

and

$$
  g^\ast E = (\eta \circ i_1)^\ast E
  \simeq i_1^\ast (\eta^\ast E) \simeq (\eta^\ast E)|_{X \times \{1\}}
$$

With this the statement follows by prop. \ref{ConcondanceOfTopologicalVectorBundles}.
