It is a common experience in representation theory that a number of mathematical structures behaves very similar to algebraic or Lie groups. After impetus of the theory of [[integrable systems]], mainly work of Leningrad's school of mathematical physics around 1980, several mathematicians (including Drinfeld, Manin, Woronowicz, Jimbo, Faddeev-Reshetikhin-Takhtajan) found in different formalisms, major series of examples which are all noncommutative noncocommutative [[Hopf algebras]] and which deform enveloping algebras of (semisimple) Lie algebras, or algebras of functions on the corresponding algebraic groups. These deformations $G_q$ depend on a parameter $q$ (sometimes one prefers formal parameter $h$ with $q= e^{ih}$ where $i=\sqrt{-1}$), which may be taken as belonging to the ground field, but also being formal (transcendental over the ground field). A peculiar case is when the parameter $q$ of the deformation is an $l$-th root of unity; the remaining cases are usually called generic $q$. The [[representation theory]] for these examples is highly developed; in fact many phenomena in the representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras (e.g. canonical bases) were discovered first as a limiting case of constructions in quantum case, which become degenerate in classical case (quantization removes degeneracy principle). While representations for generic $q$ parallel classical ones, the theory at root of unity is peculiar and the quantum groups themselves as algebras have big centers.

Nowdays, both the class of examples and the class of formalisms has been extended a lot, hence the term quantum group is not a fixed notion but rather a collective term for a rather author-dependent class of group-like objects, most often subclasses or extensions of the concept of Hopf algebras which are sometimes required to belong to families of deformations of their classical counterparts. One of the common features is that if we forget the group-like features, the examples belong to the class of noncommutative spaces (see [[noncommutative geometry]]).  

Mathematically better defined are notions (sometimes equated by various authors with the class of quantum groups) like quasitriangular Hopf algebras, [[quantum linear group]]s, FRT-algebras, quantized enveloping algebras, quantum function algebras, compact matrix pseudogroups, Kac algebras, Yangians etc.
