\section{Idea} 

In the context of [[signal processing]], a _waveform_ is a [[periodic wave]] [[signal]] viewed as a [[function]] from [[time]] to [[amplitude]], both viewed as [[real number|real-valued]] variables. One speaks of this as viewing the signal 'in the time domain'. 

This is contrast to describing the wave as a function from [[frequency]] to amplitude, where we typically have only a [[finite set]] of frequencies. One speaks in this case of viewing the signal 'in the frequency domain'. 

A [[discrete Fourier transform]] can be used to pass from the time domain to the frequency domain; an inverse discrete Fourier transform can be used to pass from the frequency domain to the time domain.
