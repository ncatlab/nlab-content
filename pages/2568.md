The __globular category__ is probably the [[globe category]].

But a __globular category__ could also be an [[internal category]] or an [[enriched category]] in/over [[globular sets]].  For instance, a [[monoidal globular category]] is an internal category in globular sets equipped with additional structure.

See [[simplicial category]] for an analogous discussion.
