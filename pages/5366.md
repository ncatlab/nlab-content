
The category of second countable complex manifolds and holomorphic maps is [[simplicially enriched category|simplicially enriched]]: $Map_\Delta(X,Y)$ consists of all *holomorphic* singular simplices $\Delta^{op}\to Map(X,Y)$ where $Map(X,Y)$ is the space of holomorphic maps from $X$ to $Y$ with [[compact-open topology]]. The full simplicially enriched subcategory spanned by Stein manifolds has a Grothendieck topology on the category of homotopy components: namely a cover of a Stein manifold $S$ is a family of holomorphic maps $\{X_\alpha\to S\}_\alpha$ such that we can deform each of them (by a homotopy within $Map(X_\alpha,S)$) to a biholomorphic map onto a Stein open subset in $S$, such that these Stein open subsets cover $S$, Thus obtained simplicially enriched site is called the simplicial Stein site $Stein_\Delta$.
