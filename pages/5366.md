## Definition

The [[category]] of [[second countable space|second countable]]  [[complex manifold]]s and [[holomorphic map]]s is [[simplicially enriched category|simplicially enriched]]: $Map_\Delta(X,Y)$ consists of all *holomorphic* singular simplices $\Delta^{op}\to Map(X,Y)$ where $Map(X,Y)$ is the space of holomorphic maps from $X$ to $Y$ with [[compact-open topology]]. 

The full simplicially enriched subcategory spanned by [[Stein manifold]]s has a [[Grothendieck topology]] on the category of homotopy components: namely a [[cover]] of a Stein manifold $S$ is a family of holomorphic maps $\{X_\alpha\to S\}_\alpha$ such that we can deform each of them (by a [[homotopy]] within $Map(X_\alpha,S)$) to a biholomorphic map onto a Stein open subset in $S$, such that these Stein [[open subset]]s cover $S$. 

This [[simplicial site]] is called the **simplicial Stein site** $Stein_\Delta$.
