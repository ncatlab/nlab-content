Left cancellative is a synonym for _all arrows are monic_.

A category $\mathcal{C}$ being _left cancellative_ means all its _morphisms are monos_. 

Equivalently, for arbitrary morphisms $f,h_0,h_1$ of $\mathcal{C}$, 
if $f\circ h_0=f\circ h_1$, then $h_0=h_1$.

## Examples


Tautological examples: 

 * any cancellative monoid

 * any groupoid

Non-tautological example: 

 * the (wide) subcategory of the category of fields obtained by removing the zero ring
