## Idea

The concept of a (left/right) _cancellative category_ is the generalization of the concept of (left/right) [[cancellative monoid]] from [[monoids]] to [[categories]].
 

## Definition

In [[category theory]], "left cancellative" is a synonym for *all [[morphism|arrows]] are [[monomorphism|monic]]*. Thus the typical way for left cancellative categories to be constructed to take a category $C$ and then restrict to a class of monomorphisms closed under composition, such as all monomomorphisms, or [[regular monomorphisms]] if the category is [[regular category|regular]], etc. 

In fact every left cancellative $C$ arises this way (in the tautological sense of applying this consideration to $C$ itself): a [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$ being _left cancellative_ means all its _morphisms are monos_. 

Equivalently, for arbitrary morphisms $f,h_0,h_1$ of $\mathcal{C}$, 
if $f\circ h_0=f\circ h_1$, then $h_0=h_1$.

## Examples


Tautological examples: 

 * any (left) [[cancellative monoid]], regared as a category with a single object

 * any [[groupoid]]

 * any [[poset]], or indeed any [[preorder]]   

Non-tautological examples: 
 
 * the category of [[fields]] (with [[ring]] [[homomorphisms]] as the morphisms)

 * the category of nontrivial [[vector spaces]] (over the field of [[real numbers]] or [[complex numbers]]) equipped with positive definite [[inner products]]
