Left cancellative is a synonym for *all arrows are [[monomorphism|monic]]*.

A [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$ being _left cancellative_ means all its _morphisms are monos_. 

Equivalently, for arbitrary morphisms $f,h_0,h_1$ of $\mathcal{C}$, 
if $f\circ h_0=f\circ h_1$, then $h_0=h_1$.

## Examples


Tautological examples: 

 * any (left) [[cancellative monoid]] 

 * any [[groupoid]]

 * any [[poset]], or indeed any [[preorder]]   

Non-tautological examples: 
 
 * the category of [[fields]] (with [[ring]] homomorphisms as the morphisms)

 * the category of nontrivial [[vector spaces]] equipped with nondegenerate [[inner products]]
