## Definition

Let $M$ be a monoid. We say that an element $a\in M$ is a _unit_ if it is [[invertible element|invertible]]. A non-unit is called
[[irreducible element|irreducible]] if it can not be represented as a product of two non-units. 

A commutative monoid $M$ is a __unique factorization monoid__ if every non-unit has a factorization $u = m_1 \cdots m_n$ as a product of irreducible non-units and this decomposition is unique up to renumbering and rescaling the irreducibles by units. 

Put differently: $M$ is a unique factorization monoid precisely when the monoid of [[principal ideal of a monoid|principal ideals]] of $M$ is a [[commutative monoid]] [[free object|freely generated]] by irreducible principal ideals.

## Examples

Every [[abelian group]] is trivially a unique factorization monoid. 

A unique factorization monoid object in the category of [[commutative]] [[semigroups]] is a _unique factorization [[semiring]]_. The statement that the semiring of positive integers is a unique factorization semiring is the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]].
