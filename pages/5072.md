## Idea

The notion of _polytope_ is the generalization of the notion of [[polygon]] to arbitrary [[dimension]]s.

* a convex 0-polytope is the [[point]]

* a convex 1-polytope is the [[interval]]

* a convex 2-polytope is a [[polygon]].

* a convex 3-polytope is a [[polyhedron]].

In [[algebraic topology]], the term “polyhedron” refers to a [[polyhedral space]].  See there for more information.
