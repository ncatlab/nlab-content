## Idea

A _proarrow equipment on a virtual double category_ or _virtual equipment_ for short is a [[virtual double category]] equipped with the same kind of structure that makes an ordinary [[double category]] into a [[proarrow equipment]].

Virtual equipments are the structures that support structures of [[generalized multicategories]].
