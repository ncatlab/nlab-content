# The set-theoretic multiverse

## Idea

The **set-theoretic multiverse** is a philosophical perspective on [[set theory]], advocated by [[Joel David Hamkins]], according to which 

> there are many distinct concepts of set, each instantiated in a corresponding set-theoretic universe.

This is in contrast to the "universe view", which 

> asserts that there is an absolute background set concept, with a corresponding absolute set-theoretic universe in which every set-theoretic question has a definite answer.

The multiverse is at least informally analogous to such categorical notions as [[Topos]], the [[2-category]] of [[toposes]], with each topos regarded as a universe of ("variable") sets.
