To quantize gravity in 4d it is so far out of reach, so people look for 3d toy models. 

The simplest model of 3d quantum gravity is the quantization of [[Chern-Simons theory]], see there. Chern-Simons theory is what Einstein gravity boils down in 3d.

One can add additional terms arriving at so called massive 3d gravity models. Very relevant for its study is the AdS3/CFT2 correspondence. 

People also look at [[loop quantum gravity]] in 3d, but it has the same principal problems as in 4d.

Another approach are [[spin foam]] models and in particular [[group field theory]].
