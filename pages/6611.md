## Idea

Solving the problem of [[quantization]] of systems including [[gravity]] -- [[quantum gravity]] -- is notoriously hard. It does however simplify drastically in very low [[dimensions]]. While the theory in dimension 4 ([[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|or higher]]) is evidently relevant for the phenomenology of the world that we perceive, the [[Einstein-Hilbert action]] and its variants that defines the theory of [[gravity]] (at least as an [[effective QFT]]) makes sense in any dimension.

The case of dimension 3 is noteworthy, because in this case the quantum theory can be and has been fairly completely understood and is nevertheless non-trivial.  Informally, this is due to the fact that behaviour of [[gravity]] in 3-dimensions is much simpler than in higher dimensions: there cannot be [[gravitational waves]] in 3-dimensions, hence no "local excitations". Accordingly, the theory turns out to have a _finite dimensional_ [[covariant phase space]]. 

More formally, one finds that in 3-dimensions, the [[Einstein-Hilbert action]], in the [[first order formulation of gravity]] ([[Cartan connection]]), becomes equivalent to the [[action functional]] of a very well studied 3-dimensional field theory, namely [[Chern-Simons theory]] for [[gauge group]] the [[Poincar√© group]] $Iso(2,1)$ (for vanishing [[cosmological constant]]) or the [[de Sitter group]]/[[anti de Sitter group]] $Iso(2,2)$ or $Iso(3,1)$ (for non-vanishing cosmological constant). See at _[[de Sitter gravity]]_ and at _[Chern-Simons Gravity](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Chern-Simons+gravity)_.

This means that one can take the [[quantization]] of $Iso(2,1)$-[[Chern-Simons theory]] as the _definition_ of 3d [[quantum gravity]]. This has first been noticed and successfully carried out in ([Witten88](#Witten88)).  One should note here that this means that one allows degenerate [[vielbein]]/[[pseudo-Riemannian metric]] tensors as field configurations of gravity. In fact, as ([Witten88](#Witten88)) discusses in detail, this [[compactification]] of configuration space can be seen as the source of the reasons why 3d quantum gravity makes exists.

Based on this striking situation in 3-dimensions it is natural to wonder if it makes sense to consider $Iso(n,1)$-[[higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory]], or variants thereof, as theories of [[quantum gravity]] in higher dimensions. The for $n \gt 2$ the corresponding [[action functional]]s differ from the [[Einstein-Hilbert action]] by higher curvature terms, but in suitable limits of the theory these can be argued to play a negligible role. For more on this see the entry _[[Chern-Simons gravity]]_ .

## Variants

One can add additional terms arriving at what is called _massive 3d gravity models_ . Very relevant for its study is the [[holographic principle|AdS3/CFT2 correspondence]].
