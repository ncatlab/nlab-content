These lectures stand out in Hegel's work as being unusually readable, their topics being ordinary subjects such as geography; accordingly these lectures are widely read and -- even if being just a very small part and never intended by him for printed publication -- they shape much of the perception Hegel's work. The introduction of these lectures contains some of the famous statements about how the _spirit_ supposedly realizes itself in the course of human history. 

In the _[[Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences]]_ these lectures roughly correspond to the material of the third part, second section, C.
