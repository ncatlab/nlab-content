A **topological vector space**, or TVS for short, is a vector space $X$ (generally over the field $k = \mathbb{R}$ or $k = \mathbb{C}$) equipped with a topology for which the addition and scalar multiplication maps 

$$+: X \times X \to X, \qquad \cdot: k \times X \to X$$ 

are continuous (where $k$ is given its standard topology). 

A TVS $X$ carries a [[uniform space]] structure generated by a basis of entourages that correspond to neighborhoods $U$ of $0$: 

$$\{(u, v) \in X \times X: u - v \in U\}$$

Thus a host of uniform notions (uniform continuity, completeness, etc.) carry over to the TVS context. Also from the uniformity, it follows that a TVS is Hausdorff (and also completely regular) if and only if it is $T_0$. Most authors insist on the $T_0$ condition to rule out degenerate cases; we follow that tradition here. 

The condition that scalar multiplication is continuous puts significant constraints on the topology of $X$. For example, in the case $k = \mathbb{R}$, the local compactness of $k$ implies that for any non-zero $v \in X$, the function 

$$- \cdot v: k \to V$$ 

maps $k$ [[homeomorphism|homeomorphically]] onto its image. It follows quickly that $X$ cannot (for instance) be [[compact space|compact]]; a classical theorem along these lines is that $V$ can be locally compact (Hausdorff) if and only if $V$ is finite-dimensional. On the other hand, a TVS is [[connected space|path-connected]]. 

More classical material should be added, particular on locally convex TVS, and so much more.
