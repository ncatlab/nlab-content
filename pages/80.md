## Scope

In the philosophical part of $n$Lab we discuss higher category theory and its repercussions in philosophy. More widely, the future entries on philosophy in nLab should also contain [[philosophy of mathematics]] in general, and of [[logic and foundations]] in particular. As it is usual for philosophy and the study of thought, it is usefully carried on via study of historical thinkers and their ideas, hence some idea-related aspects of the [[history of mathematics]] are welcome. 

## Nonscope

There are many articles which are not philosophy, but rather essays on general mathematics, and so on, often opinion pieces on what is important and so on. That is not philosophy _per se_, but it may be relevant thoughts and we could link them rather at related pages, like [[opinions on development of mathematics]].  


## Idea of relevance of higher categories

Philosophical interest in [[n-category|n-categories]] may be characterised as belonging to one of two kinds.

* **[[metaphysics|Metaphysical]]**: The formation of a new language which may prove to be as important for philosophy as predicate logic was for [[Bertrand Russell]] and the [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosophers]] he inspired. 

* **Illustrative of mathematics as intellectual enquiry**: Such a reconstitution of the fundamental language of [[mathematics]] reveals much about mathematics as a tradition of enquiry stretching back several millennia, for instance, the continued willingness to reconsider basic concepts.


## Metaphysics

[[metaphysics]]

* [[higher category theory|Higher category theory]] provides a new foundation for mathematics - [[foundations|logical]] and [[foundations and philosophy|philosophical]].

* [[higher category theory|Higher category theory]] refines the notion of sameness to allow more subtle variants. It advocates the avoidance of [[evil]].

* There ought to be a [[vertical categorification|categorified]] [[internal logic|logic]], or 2-logic. There are some suggestions that existing work on modal logic is relevant. Blog discussion: [I](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2007/11/concrete_groups_and_axiomatic_1.html), [II](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/02/2galois_and_2logic.html), [III](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/03/worrying_about_2logic.html), [IV](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/11/the_internal_language_of_a_2to.html). Mike Shulman's project: [2-categorical logic](http://ncatlab.org/michaelshulman/show/2-categorical+logic).

* [[Homotopy type theory]] may be thought of as a vertical categorification of logic to $(\infinity,1)$.

* [[higher category theory|Higher category theory]] may provide the right tools to take [[physics]] forward. [A Prehistory of n-Categorical Physics](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/history.pdf) See also [[physics]].

* [[higher category theory and physics]], [[geometry of physics]]

* More speculatively, [[category theory]] may prove useful in [[biology]].


## Enquiry

>"Mathematical wisdom, if not forgotten, lives as an invariant of all its (re)presentations in a permanently self–renewing discourse." (Yuri Manin)

To [[vertical categorification|categorify]] mathematical constructions properly, one must have understood their essential features. This leads us to consider what it is to get concepts 'right'. Which kind of 'realism' is suitable for mathematics? Which virtues should a mathematical community possess to further its ends: a knowledge of its history, close attention to instruction and the sharing of knowledge, a willingness to admit to what is currently lacking in its programmes?


## Philosophical sentiments

* [[Platonism]]

* [[idealism]]

  * [[objective idealism]]

  * [[subjective idealism]]

* [[positivism]]

* [[universal exceptionalism]]
