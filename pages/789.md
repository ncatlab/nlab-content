## Idea

Generalized complex geometry is effectively the study of the [[Lie infinity-algebroid|Lie 2-algebroid]]s called the  [[standard Courant algebroid]]s $\mathfrak{c}(X)$ of [[manifold]]s $X$. 

One finds (as described at [[standard Courant algebroid]]) that

* choices of sub-[[Lie algebroid]]s of $\mathfrak{c}(X)$ encode **[[Dirac Structure]]s** and -- after [[complexification]] -- **generalized [[complex structure]]s**;

* choices of [[section]]s of the canonical morphism $\mathfrak{c}(X) \to T X$ to the [[tangent Lie algebroid]]s encode **generalized Riemannian metrics**: pairs consisting of a (possibly [[pseudo-Riemannian metric|pseudo]]-)[[Riemannian metric]] and a [[differential form|2-form]].

In components these are structures found on the [[vector bundle]]

$$
  T X \oplus T^* X
  \,,
$$

the [[direct sum]] of the [[tangent bundle]] with the cotangent bundle of $X$. 

Generalized complex geometry thus generalizes and unifies both

* [[complex geometry]]

and

* [[symplectic geometry]].

and

* [[Riemannian geometry]].


It was in particular motivated by the observation that this provides a natural formalism for describing [[T-duality]].




## References

Generalized complex geometry was propsoed by [[Nigel Hitchin]] as a formalism in [[differential geometry]] that would be suited to capture the phenomena that physicists encountered in the study of [[T-duality]].
It was later and is still developed by his students, notably Gualtieri and Cavalcanti.
