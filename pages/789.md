## Idea

What is called _generalized complex geometry_ is the study of the geometry of [[symplectic Lie n-algebroid|symplectic Lie 2-algebroid]] called [[standard Courant algebroid]]s $\mathfrak{c}(X)$ (over a [[smooth manifold]] $X$). 

This geometry of symplectic Lie 2-algebroids turns out to unify, among other things, [[complex geometry]] with [[symplectic geometry]]. This unification notably captures central aspects of [[T-duality]].

### Generalized complex structure on a vector space

Let $V$ be a [[dimension|finite dimensional]] [[vector space]] over the [[real numbers]].

Recall that a _[[complex structure]]_ on $V$ is a [[linear map]]

$$
  J : V \to V
$$

such that $J \circ J = - id_V$. And a [[symplectic structure]] on $V$ is equivalently a linear [[isomorphism]]

$$
  \omega : V \to V^*
$$

such that

$$
  \omega^* = - \omega
  \,,
$$

where $V^*$ denotes the [[dual vector space]] and $\omega^*$ the dual linear map.

The following definition may be thought of as combining these two concepts.

###### Definition

A **generalized complex structure** on $V$ is a [[linear map]]

$$
  \mathcal{J} : V \oplus V^* \to V \oplus V^*
$$

(an [[endomorphism]] of the [[direct sum]] of $V$ with its [[dual vector space]])

such that it is both

1. a [[complex structure]] on $V \oplus V^*$ in that $\mathcal{J}^2 = - id$;

1. a [[symplectic structure]] on $V \oplus V^*$ in that $\mathcal{J}^* = - \mathcal{J}$.

The following shows that this is indeed a joint generalization of complex and symplectic structures.

###### Examples

Let $J : V \to V$ be an ordinary complex structure on $V$. Then the linear endomorphism of $V \oplus V^*$ defined by [[matrix calculus]] as

$$
  \mathcal{J}_j := 
  \left(
    \array{
       -J & 0
       \\
       0 & J^*
    }
  \right)
$$

is a generalized complex structure on $V$.

Similarly, let $\omega : V \to V^*$ be an ordinary symplectic structure on $V$. then the endomorphism

$$
  \mathcal{J}_\omega :=
  \left(
    \array{
      0 & - \omega^{-1}
      \\
      \omega & 0
    }
  \right)
$$

is a generalized complex structure on $V$.

### Generalized complex structure on a manifold


(...)


## Properties

One finds (as described at [[standard Courant algebroid]]) that

* choices of sub-[[Lie algebroid]]s of $\mathfrak{c}(X)$ encode **[[Dirac structure]]s** and -- after [[complexification]] -- **generalized [[complex structure]]s**;

* choices of [[section]]s of the canonical morphism $\mathfrak{c}(X) \to T X$ to the [[tangent Lie algebroid]]s encode **generalized Riemannian metrics**: pairs consisting of a (possibly [[pseudo-Riemannian metric|pseudo]]-)[[Riemannian metric]] and a [[differential form|2-form]].

  In applications in [[string theory]], this encodes the field of [[gravity]] and the [[Kalb–Ramond field]], respectively. (There are also proposals for how the [[dilaton]] field appears in this context.)

In components these are structures found on the [[vector bundle]]

$$
  T X \oplus T^* X
  \,,
$$

the [[direct sum]] of the [[tangent bundle]] with the cotangent bundle of $X$. 

Generalized complex geometry thus generalizes and unifies

* [[complex geometry]],
* [[symplectic geometry]], and
* [[Riemannian geometry]].

It was in particular motivated by the observation that this provides a natural formalism for describing [[T-duality]].

### General

Generalized complex geometry was proposed by [[Nigel Hitchin]] as a formalism in [[differential geometry]] that would be suited to capture the phenomena that physicists encountered in the study of [[T-duality]].
It was later and is still developed by his students, notably Gualtieri and Cavalcanti.

### As targets for $\sigma$-models

Generalized complex structures may serve as [[target spaces]] for [[sigma-models]]. Relations to the [[Poisson sigma-model]] and the [[Courant sigma-model]] are discussed in

### Geometry of supergravity

Generalized complex geometry and variant of [[exceptional generalized complex geometry]] are natural for describing [[supergravity]] background compactifications in [[string theory]] with their [[T-duality]] and [[U-duality]] symmetries.
