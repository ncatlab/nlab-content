## Definition

Given a [[modal type theory]], hence [[type theory]] equipped with a [[closure operator]] [[modality]] $\Diamond$ ([[monad|monadic]]) or $\Box$ ([[comonad|comonadic]]), the a [[type]] $X$ is _modal_ with respect to $\Diamond$/$\Box$ if 

* the [[unit of an adjunction|unit]] $\eta \colon X \to \Diamond X$

* or the counit $\epsilon \colon \Box X \to X$

is an [[equivalence]]. 

The collection of modal types forms the _closure_ of the given closure operator. 

Under [[propositions as types]] a [[proposition]] that is modal is also called a _[[stable proposition]]_.
