## Definition

The __dissolution locale__ $\mathfrak{C}L$ of a [[locale]] $L$ is defined as the poset of its [[sublocales]] (equivalently: [[nuclei]] on $L$) equipped with the relation of reverse inclusion.

There is a canonical morphism of locales
$$\iota\colon\mathfrak{C}L \to L$$
such that the map $\iota^*$ sends an open $a\in L$ to the open in $\mathfrak{C}L$ given by the open sublocale of $a$.

## Interpretation

The map $\mathfrak{C}L\to L$ can be considered an analogue of the canonical map $T_d \to T$ for a [[topological space]] $T$, where $T_d$ is the underlying set of $T$ equipped with the [[discrete topology]].

In particular, *discontinuous maps* $L\to M$ could be defined as morphisms of locales $\mathfrak{C}L\to M$, see Picado–Pultr, XIV.7.3.
