#Idea#

The notion of _stack_ is the one-step [[vertical categorification]] of a [[sheaf]]. 

Or rather, it is the categorification of the _codomain_ of a sheaf. If also the domain (the [[site]]) is categorified, one speaks of a [[derived stack]].

Since the full $\infty$-categorification of "[[sheaf]]" is [[infinity-stack]], a stack is conversely an [[infinity-stack]] which happens to be 1-truncated.

From this $\infty$-point of view it seems a bit pointless to say "stack" instead of "2-sheaf" and accordingly for instance in [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT]] the term [[(infinity,1)-sheaf|infinity-sheaf]] is used instead of $\infty$-stack.

More concretely this means that a stack on a [[site]] $S$ is 

* a ([[pseudofunctor|pseudo]]-)[[functor]] $S^{op} \to Grpd$ to the 2-category [[Grpd]] of groupoids;

* that satisfies [[descent]].


In some circles the notion of a stack as a generalized groupoid is almost more familiar than the notion of sheaf as a [[space and quantity|generalized space]]. For instance [[differentiable stack]]s have attracted much attention in the study of [[Lie groupoid]]s and [[orbifold]]s, while [[generalized smooth space]]s are only beginning to be investigated more in [[Lie theory]]. 


#Provisional discussion#

The following is "provisional" material on stacks that [[Todd Trimble]] wrote in the course of a discussion with [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]. Somebody should turn this here into a coherent entry on stacks.

(Todd speaking.) I don't really speak "stacks", but in an effort to build a bridge between sheaves and stacks, I'll write down what I thought I understood, and ask someone such as Urs to come in and check. (Warning: I'm treating this edit box almost as a sandbox, in that what I say below is all a bit provisional until we get some discussion going.) 

+--{.query}
 Hi Todd, thanks for this. I started making some remarks on the relation between descent $\infty$-categories and pseudofunctors from [[cover]]s regarded as [[sieve]]s (hence as presheaves) at [[descent and codescent]] in the section titled _Descent in terms of pseudo-functors_.
=--

At the simplest level, let $C$ be a category. As we know, a presheaf on $C$ is just a functor $X: C^{op} \to Set$. 

Now let's categorify just once: regard a category $C$ as a bicategory whose local hom-categories are discrete. What I'll call a "pre-stack" is then a homomorphism of bicategories $X: C^{op} \to Cat$. Here I'm following Street's terminology: a homomorphism of bicategories is the "pseudo" version of a weak map of bicategories, as opposed to the "lax" version. So, we have given coherent isomorphisms $X(f)X(g) \to X(f g)$, and so on.  

Now suppose that $C$ also comes equipped with a topology $J$, and let $F$ be a $J$-covering sieve for $c$, so that in particular it's a subfunctor $i: F \hookrightarrow \hom(-, c)$. We want to build a (truncated) simplicial object out of this, and to this end I'll use some yoga which was basically developed in my Cafe post [on the bar construction](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2007/05/on_the_bar_construction.html) [perhaps this may go partway to addressing your most recent [query](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2007/05/on_the_bar_construction.html#c021027) there, Urs]. 

Namely, there is a canonical way of presenting $F$ as a colimit of representables. Officially, it's given by a coend formula, but it's probably more illuminating to think of it in terms of tensor products over $C$: 

$$\hom_C(-, -) \otimes_C F(-) \cong F(-)$$ 

In the long-winded version, this says that $F$ is the coequalizer of a diagram having the form 

$$\sum_{c, d} \hom_C(-, c) \times \hom_C(c, d) \times F(d) \stackrel{\to}{\to} \sum_c \hom_C(-, c) \times F(c) \to F(-)$$ 

where the more visible one of the two parallel arrows involves the contravariant action of $C$ on $F$: 

$$\hom(c, d) \times F(d) \to F(c)$$ 

and the less visible one uses $C$ acting on itself: 

$$\hom(-, c) \times \hom(c, d) \times F(d) \to hom(-, d) \times F(d)$$ 

The point now is that this coequalizer diagram represents the tail end of a simplicial object (with $F(-)$ appearing in dimension -1), which in the notation of the bar construction one could call $B(C, C, F)$. Let me explain this last bit. 

The point is that any category $C$ can be regarded as a monad in the bicategory of spans. The underlying span is of course 

$$C_0 \stackrel{dom}{\leftarrow} C_1 \stackrel{cod}{\to} C_0$$ 

and a presheaf $F$ on $C$, as a discrete op-fibration, has an underlying span 

$$C_0 \leftarrow F \to 1$$ 

and is precisely an algebra over the monad $C$. Then, given the data of a monad and an algebra over that monad, one proceeds to build the bar construction as a simplicial object, and I think this is probably the simplicial thingy we want to base the category of descent data on (given a pre-stack $X$). 

In fact, if memory serves the category of descent data can be efficiently expressed in bicategorical language as follows. The covering sieve $F$ becomes a homomorphism of bicategories by changing base from $Set$ to $Cat$: 

$$C^{op} \stackrel{F}{\to} Set \stackrel{discrete}{\to} Cat$$ 

and, abbreviating $discrete$ to $d$, it turns out that 

$$Desc_F(X) \simeq Nat(d F, X)$$ 

where the thing on the right side is the category of strong (i.e., pseudo) natural transformations between the indicated bicategory homomorphisms. 

In that case, the stack condition on $X$ becomes the statement that the canonical functor 

$$X(c) \stackrel{Yoneda}{\cong} Nat(d \hom(-, c), X) \to Nat(d F, X)$$ 

(where the first equivalence comes from the bicategorical Yoneda lemma, and the second functor is induced from the subfunctor $i: F \to \hom(-, c)$) is an equivalence for all $J$-covering sieves $F$. This formulation connects up nicely, that is, is a straight categorification of what was put down in the entry [[sheaf]].
