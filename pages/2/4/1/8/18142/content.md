## Idea

The _Jordan curve theorem_ is a basic fact in [[topology]]. It stands out as having a statement that intuitively seems completely obvious, but which turns out to require a non-trivial [[formal proof]].

The theorem states that every [[continuous function|continuous]] [[loop]] (where a loop is a closed [[curve]]) in the [[Euclidean plane]] which does not intersect itself (a _[[Jordan curve]]_) divides the [[plane]] into two [[disjoint subsets]] (the [[connected components]] of the curve\'s [[complement]]), a [[bounded subspace|bounded]] region inside the curve, and an unbounded region outside of it, each of which has the original curve as its [[boundary]].


## Generalization

The __Jordan--Brouwer separation theorem__ states that, in the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$, every simple closed continuous [[hypersurface]] (defined as the [[image]] of a [[continuous map|continuous]] [[injection]] from the [[sphere]] $S^{n-1}$) has an [[exterior]] with two [[connected components]], one [[bounded subspace|bounded]] (the inside of the hypersurface) and one unbounded, each of which has the original hypersurface as its [[boundary]].  (Furthermore, the continuous map defining the hypersurface can be extended to an [[automorphism|auto]]-[[homeomorphism]] of $\mathbb{R}^n$ under which the inside and outside appear as the images of the inside and outside of the sphere.)
