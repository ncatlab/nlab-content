## Idea

The _Lorentz force_ is the [[force]] excerted in a [[particle]] that is charged under the [[electromagnetic field]].

See [[relativistic particle]] for details.

## Properties

### In Kaluza-Klein compactifications

If one models the [[electromagnetic field]] via the [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism]] as a field of [[gravity]] on a [[fiber bundle]], then [[trajectories]] of [[charged particles]] subject to the Lorentz force in the base space of that bundle are euivalently just [[geodesics]] on the total space, e.g. ([Bleecker 81](#Bleecker81)). An exposition of this fact is in ([Bartlett 13](#Bartlett13)).
