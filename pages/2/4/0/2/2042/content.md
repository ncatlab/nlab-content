In [[Des catégories abéliennes]] Pierre Gabriel introduced an optional property of an [[abelian category]], the __property (sup)__:

__(sup)__ For any ascending chain $\Omega$ of [[subobjects]] of a fixed object $M$, the [[supremum]] of $\Omega$ exists; and, for any subobject $L\hookrightarrow M$, the canonical morphism
$$
(sup)\{L\cap P | P\in \Omega\}\to (sup \Omega) \cap L
$$
is an isomorphism. 

Gabriel's property (sup) is satisfied by any [[Grothendieck category]] (in some expositions it is listed as a part of the definition), e.g. the category of all [[modules]] over a fixed [[ring]] $R$, and the category of [[sheaf|sheaves]] of [[abelian groups]] on a fixed [[topological space]] $X$. 

According to the Appendix B of the Thomason--Trobaugh contribution to [[Grothendieck Festschrift]], it is not known whether the category $Qcoh_Y$ of [[quasicoherent sheaf|quasicoherent sheaves]] over an arbitrary scheme $Y$ is a Grothendieck category (although this is known for a large class), but it is an elementary fact that it does satisfy Gabriel's property (sup). If an abelian category is [[noetherian category|noetherian]] it clearly satisfies the property (sup).
