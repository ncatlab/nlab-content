## Idea

The generalization of the [[WZW model]] where [[target space]] is not necessarily a [[Lie group]] $G$, but a [[coset]] space $G/H$ for some [[subgroup]] $H$.

## CS/WZW correspondence

There exists a [[AdS3-CFT2 and CS-WZW correspondence|well-known correspondence]] between 3d $G$-[[Chern-Simons theory]], and the 2d $G$ [[Wess-Zumino-Witten model]]. It is then natural to ask what is the corresponding 3d theory to a 2d coset WZW model.

A first, fairly general, answer was proposed in ([Moore & Seiberg 89](#MS89)), where it is claimed that for a $G/H$ coset model the corresponding 3d theory is $(G_k \times H_{-\tilde{k}})/Z$ Chern-Simons, with $k,\tilde{k}\geq 0$ some appropriate non-negative Chern-Simons levels, and $Z$ the common center. The role of the quotient by $Z$ is to remove additional copies of the vacuum not present in the coset model. 

However, this general proposal fails in some specific coset models, now known as *Maverick* coset theories (see e.g. ([Dunbar & Joshi 93](#DJ93))). These Maverick theories often arise when one of the groups is centerless. A more general proposal that is compatible with the known Maverick theories appears in ([Cordova & Garcia-Sepulveda 23](#CGS23)), where a Physics argument based on gauging a [[generalized global symmetry]] is provided.
