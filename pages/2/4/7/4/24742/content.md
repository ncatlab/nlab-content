A binary relation on a set $S$ is a __tolerance relation__ if it is symmetric and reflexive. 

This is a wide weakening of the concept of equality. For example, every equivalence relation is a tolerance relation. Equivalence relations are used to make equivalence classes, quotient sets and quotient groupoids, as well as associated algebras. Some modifications of operator algebras related to quotients may be studied even in generality of tolerance relations.
