## Definition ##

In [[constructive mathematics]], a [[set]] $X$ has __stable equality__ if any two [[elements]] of $X$ are [[equality|equal]] if (hence iff) they are [[double negation|not not]] equal.  

## Examples ##

* Every [[set]] with [[decidable equality]] has stable equality, but not conversely.

* Every [[set]] $S$ with a [[tight apartness relation]] $\#$ has stable equality, because even in [[constructive mathematics]], given elements $x \in S$ and $y \in S$, $\neg \neg \neg (x \# y) \iff \neg (x \# y)$, and because $\neg (x \# y) \iff x = y$, $\neg \neg (x = y) \iff x = y$, and thus $S$ is stable. 

* In particular, the [[Dedekind real numbers]] have stable equality, and any [[subfield]] of the [[Dedekind real numbers]] has stable equality. 

* Since every [[Heyting field]] has a tight apartness relation and thus stable equality, every [[nilpotent element]] is equal to zero.
