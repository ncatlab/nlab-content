## Idea

A [[crossed product algebra|crossed product]] [[C*-algebra]].

## Properties

### Equivalence to convolution algebra

If the $A$ is a [[C*-algebra]] [[algebra of functions|of functions]] on some [[topological space]] $X$ and the [[action]] of $G$ on $A$ is induced from an [[action]] on $X$, then in good cases the crossed product algebra is equivalent to the [[convolution algebra]] of the [[action groupoid]].

e.g. ([Land 13, prop. 4.2](#Land13), [Soltan, section 5.1](#Soltan), [Bos 07, example 12.2.8](#Bos07)) also ([Connes 06, around p. 13](#Connes06))
