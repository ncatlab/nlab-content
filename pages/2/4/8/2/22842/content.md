## Idea ##
A delta lens (or d-lens) is a [[functor]] with additional structure specifying a suitable choice of lifts. Delta lenses can be understood in a number of ways: 

* A morphism between [[categories]] which is both [[functor]] and [[cofunctor]];

* A generalization of split [[Grothendieck fibration|Grothendieck opfibrations]] where the chosen lifts need not be [[Cartesian morphism|opcartesian morphisms]];

* A [[vertical categorification|categorification]] of classical [[lens (in computer science)|lenses]] between [[sets]]. 

## Definition ##

A **delta lens** $(f, \varphi) : A \to B$ from a [[category]] $A$ to a category $B$ consists of a [[functor]] $f : A \to B$ together with a _lifting operation_ sending each pair $(a \in A, u : f a \to b \in B)$ to a [[morphism]] $\varphi(a, u) : a \to a'$ in $A$, where $a' = cod(\varphi(a, u))$, such that 

* $\varphi$ defines a choice of lifts: $f \varphi(a, u) = u$,

* $\varphi$ preserves identity morphisms: $\varphi(a, 1_{f a}) = 1_{a}$, 

* $\varphi$ preserves composition: $\varphi(a, v \circ u) = \varphi(a', v) \circ \varphi(a, u)$ where $a' = cod(\varphi(a, u))$.

## Properties ## 

\begin{proposition}
A delta lens $(f, \varphi) : A \to B$ is equivalent to a [[functor]] $f \colon A \to B$ and a [[cofunctor]] $\varphi \colon A \nrightarrow B$ such that $f a = \varphi_{0} a$ for all objects $a \in A$, and $f \varphi_{1}(a \in A, u \colon fa \to b \in B) = u$. 
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
See ([Ahman-Uustalu 2017, Section 6](#AhmanUustalu17)) and ([Clarke 2020](#Clarke20a)). 
\end{proof}

## Examples ##

* A delta lens between [[indiscrete category|codiscrete categories]] is precisely a classical [[lens (in computer science)]]; see ([Johnson-Rosebrugh 2016, Proposition 4](#JohnsonRosebrugh16)). 

* Every [[function]] $A \to B$ yields a delta lens $disc(A) \rightarrow disc(B)$ between [[discrete category|discrete categories]]. 

* Every [[discrete fibration|discrete opfibration]] is a delta lens whose lifting operation is determined by the unique [[Cartesian morphism|opcartesian lifts]]. Conversely, a delta lens is a discrete opfibration if the equation $\varphi(a, f w) = w$ holds for all morphisms $w \colon a \to a'$ in $A$. 

* A split [[Grothendieck fibration|Grothendieck opfibration]] is a delta lens whose chosen lifts are [[Cartesian morphism|opcartesian morphisms]].

* Dually, a split [[Grothendieck fibration]] $A \to B$ is a delta lens $A^{op} \to B^{op}$. 

* Every [[split epimorphism]] of [[monoid|monoids]] with a chosen [[section]] is a delta lens, when the monoids a considered as categories with a single object.

* More generally, every [[bijective on objects functor]] with a chosen [[section]] is a delta lens.
