Integral cohomology or "ordinary cohomology" is the ordinary version of [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]], the one that is represented by the [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum]].

Integral cohomology is best known maybe in its incarnation as [[singular cohomology]] or [[Čech cohomology]] with coefficients in the integers.

#Geometric models#

* integral cohomology in degree 1 classifies complex [[line bundle]];

* integral cohomology in degree 2 classifies complex line [[bundle gerbe]] / line [[principal 2-bundle|2-bundle]]s;

* integral cohomology in degree $n$ classifies line [[principal infinity-bundle|n-bundle]]s .
