## Idea

Integral cohomology or "[[ordinary cohomology]]" (see there) is the ordinary version of [[Whitehead-generalized cohomology]], the one that is [[Brown representability theorem|represented]] by the [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum]] $H \mathbb{Z}$ with [[coefficients]] in the [[integers]].

Integral cohomology is best known maybe in its incarnation as [[singular cohomology]] or [[Čech cohomology]] with coefficients in the integers.

## Geometric models

* integral cohomology in degree 1 classifies [[complex line bundle]];

* integral cohomology in degree 2 classifies complex line [[bundle gerbe]] / line [[principal 2-bundle|2-bundle]]s;

* integral cohomology in degree $n$ classifies line [[circle n-bundles|n-bundles]].

## Related concepts

* [[rational cohomology]], [[real cohomology]], [[complex cohomology]]
