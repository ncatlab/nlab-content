## Idea

The Haag--Kastler axioms (sometimes also called Araki--Haag--Kastler axioms) try to define in a mathematically precise way the notion of [[quantum field theory]] (QFT), by axiomatizing how its [[local nets of observables]] should behave. 

The approch to quantum field theory based on these axioms is often called [[AQFT]]: _algebraic quantum field theory_ .

Although they are called axioms, one should keep in mind that the Haag--Kastler approach to QFT has not reached its final state, so that different versions of the axioms are used by practitioners of the field.

From the [[nPOV]], the Haag-Kastler axioms descibe a coflabby [[copresheaf|presheaf]] of algebras. This kind of structure is similar to the notion of a [[factorization algebra]], which plays a role in other approaches to formalize local algebras of observables.


## Definition

1. Axiom A: 

   To every "allowed" (e.g. bounded open) region $O$ in spacetime there is associated a [[C*-algebra]]; this association fulfils isotony.
The basic assumption of the Haag--Kastler approach is that everything that can be measured in certain regions of spacetime $O$ (like temperature or particle count) is described by an algebra $A(O)$, so that the theory consists of a [[net]] of [[operator algebras]] and a [[state]] $p$ that describes the physical system. There are different approaches to define what regions are "allowed", one common approach is to take all [[bounded space|bounded]] [[open subspace|open]] subsets of [[Minkowski space|Minkowski]] [[spacetime]].

1. Axiom B: locality

   Locality Algebras assigned to regions that are spacelike separated commute. 

1. Axiom C:  Transformation Properties

   The geometric symmetry operations map the algebra of a region onto the algebra of the transformed region.

   In Minkowski spacetime the geometric symmetry group is usually be taken to be the [[Poincaré group]], but note that some authors consider subgroups of the full Poincar&#233; group, like the subgroup of translations (Borchers: "Translation group and particle representations in quantum field theory").

1. Axiom D: Positivity of Energy

   An axiom is needed to ensure that only nonnegative energies occur -- one possibility is the "spectrum condition", which says that the spectrum (to be more precise: the support of the [[spectral measure]]) of the operator associated with a translation is contained in the closed forward light cone, for all translations. 

## Remarks

Unlike the [[Wightman axioms]], the Haag--Kastler axioms do not need the notion of "[[physical field|field]]": the fields in the Wightman axioms are -- from the Haag--Kastler point of view -- only necessary to describe how the algebras of observables are constructed; any way to consistently construct the net of algebras would suffice.

It is possible to prove both a [[spin-statistics theorem]] and a [[PCT theorem]] in the Haag-Kastler approach. The mathematically precise, model independent statements and their proofs are considered to be a major breakthrough of the theory.

The nLab has a page with a specific choice of axioms and an exposition of some of their consequences here: [[Haag-Kastler vacuum representation]]
