The Haag--Kastler axioms (sometimes also called Araki--Haag--Kastler axioms) try to define in a mathematically precise way the notion of [[quantum field theory]] (QFT). Although they are called axioms, one should keep in mind that the Haag--Kastler approach to QFT has not reached its final state, so that different versions of the axioms are used by practitioners of the field.

Axiom A: To every "allowed" (e.g. bounded open) region $O$ in spacetime there is associated a [[C*-algebra]]; this association fulfils isotony.
The basic assumption of the Haag--Kastler approach is that everything that can be measured in certain regions of spacetime $O$ (like temperature or particle count) is described by an algebra $A(O)$, so that the theory consists of a [[net]] of [[operator algebras]] and a [[state]] $p$ that describes the physical system. There are different approaches to define what regions are "allowed", one common approach is to take all [[bounded space|bounded]] [[open subspace|open]] subsets of [[Minkowski space|Minkowski]] [[spacetime]].

Axiom B: Locality
Algebras assigned to regions that are spacelike separated commute. 

Axiom C: Transformation Properties
The geometric symmetry operations map the algebra of a region onto the algebra of the transformed region.
In Minkowski spacetime the geometric symmetry group is usually be taken to be the [[Poincaré group]], but note that some authors consider subgroups of the full Poincar&#233; group, like the subgroup of translations (Borchers: "Translation group and particle representations in quantum field theory").

Axiom D: Positivity of Energy
An axiom is needed to ensure that only nonnegative energies occur -- one possibility is the "spectrum condition", which says that the spectrum (to be more precise: the support of the [[spectral measure]]) of the operator associated with a translation is contained in the closed forward light cone, for all translations. 

Remark: Unlike the [[Wightman axioms]], the Haag--Kastler axioms do not need the notion of "[[physical field|field]]": the fields in the Wightman axioms are -- from the Haag--Kastler point of view -- only necessary to describe how the algebras of observables are constructed; any way to consistently construct the net of algebras would suffice.
