## Definition

Let $(\Sigma, T)$ be a [[sigma-frame of propositions|$\sigma$-frame of propositions]]. An [[Archimedean ordered field]] $F$ is **admissible for $\Sigma$** or **$\Sigma$-admissible** if it comes with a function $(-)\lt_\Sigma(-):F \times F \to \Sigma$ such that for all $x:F$ and $y:F$, $T(x \lt_\Sigma y) \simeq (x \lt y)$. 

## Properties

For any given $\sigma$-frame of propositions $(\Sigma, T)$, 

* The [[initial object|initial]] Archimedean ordered field which is admissible for $\Sigma$ is the ordered field of [[rational numbers]]. 

* The [[terminal object|terminal]] Archimedean ordered field which is admissible for $\Sigma$ is the ordered field of two-sided $\Sigma$-[[Dedekind real numbers]], which are constructed out of the [[Dedekind cuts]] valued in $\Sigma$. 

* Assuming the [[limited principle of omniscience]], the [[boolean domain]] $\mathbb{2}$ is a $\sigma$-frame of propositions, which means that every [[discrete field|discrete]] [[Archimedean ordered field]] is admissible for the [[boolean domain]]. In addition, assuming [[LPO]], the [[Cauchy real numbers]], [[HoTT book real numbers]], and the lower, upper, and two-sided $\mathbb{2}$-[[Dedekind real numbers]] are all $\mathbb{2}$-admissible Archimedean ordered fields.
