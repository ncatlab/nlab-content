###### Definition
A **lined topos** $(\mathcal{T}, R)$ is

* a [[topos]] $\mathcal{T}$ 

* equipped with a choice of commutative [[internalization|internal]] [[ring]] object $(k,+,\cdot)$

* and equipped with a choice $(R,+,\cdot)$ of [[internalization|internal]] commutative [[algebra]] object $(R,+,\cdot)$ over $k$.

# Variations #

* A [[smooth topos]] is a lined topos where the line is required to be a smooth differentiable space with [[infinitesimal object|infinitesimal]] subspaces in a certain way. This is the basic type of object studied in [[synthetic differential geometry]].

* A [[super smooth topos]] is a lined topos that is a [[smooth topos]] and in which the $k$-algebra structure on $R$ is refined to that of a $k$-[[superalgebra]].



# Constructions in lined toposes #

The line object in a lined topos canonically has the structure of a [[interval object|cartesian interval object]] and hence gives rise to a notion of [[schreiber:path ∞-groupoid|path ∞-groupoid]] of each object.
