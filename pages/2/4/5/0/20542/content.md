## Idea

Borel measures are [[measures]] on the [[Borel σ-algebra]] of a [[topological space]].  They play an important role in [[measure theory]].


## Definition

A __Borel measure__ on $X$ is a (countably additive) measure on the [[Borel σ-algebra]] of the topological space $X$.

A __Baire measure__ on $X$ is a (countably additive) measure on the [[Baire σ-algebra]] of the topological space $X$.

A [[Radon measure]] on $X$ is a Borel measure $\mu$ on $X$
such that for any [[Borel subset]] $B\subset X$ and any $\epsilon\gt0$ there is a [[compact subset]] $K\subset B$
such that $|\mu|(B\setminus K)\lt\epsilon$,
where $|\mu|$ denotes the total [[variation]] of the measure $\mu$.

Borel measures are uniquely determined by their values on open subsets,
and are closely related to [[continuous valuations]] on the underlying [[locale]].
