## Idea

An [[(∞,2)-category]] of [[(∞,2)-sheaves]]. The joint higher generalization of the notion of [[(∞,1)-topos]] and [[2-topos]].

The archetypical example is the [[(infinity,2)-category of (infinity,1)-categories]] $Cat_{(\infty,1)}$. See also at *[[formal category theory]]*.

  > **Abstract:** We will introduce a version of [[dependent type theory]] that is suitable to develop a [[synthetic mathematics|synthetic]] theory of [[1-categories]]. The [[axioms]] are both a [[fragment]] and an extension of ordinary [[dependent type theory]]. The [[axioms]] are chosen so that [[(∞,1)-category theory]] (in the form of [[quasi-categories]] or [[complete Segal spaces]]) gives a [[categorical semantics|semantic interpretation]], in a way which extends [[Vladimir Voevodsky|Voevodsky]]'s interpretation of [[univalence axiom|univalent]] [[dependent type theory]] in the [[homotopy theory]] of [[Kan complexes]]. More generally, using a slight generalization of [Shulman's methods](relation+between+type+theory+and+category+theory#Shulman19), we should be able to see that the theory of [[internal (∞,1)-category|(∞,1)‑categories internally]] in any [[(∞,1)-topos|∞‑topos]] (as [developed by Martini and Wolf](internal+infinity1-category#ReferencesInternalToInfinityTopos)) is a [[categorical semantics|semantic interpretation]] as well (hence so is [[Parametrized Higher Category Theory and Higher Algebra|parametrized higher category theory]] introduced by Barwick, Dotto, Glasman, Nardin and Shah). There are of course strong links with [[∞-cosmoi]] of Riehl and Verity as well as with [[cubical type theory|cubical HoTT]] (as strongly suggested by the work of Licata and Weaver), or [[simplicial type theory|simplicial HoTT]] (as in the work of Buchholtz and Weinberger). We will explain the axioms in detail and have a glimpse at basic theorems and constructions in this context ([[(∞,1)-Yoneda lemma|Yoneda Lemma]], [[(∞,1)-Kan extension|Kan extensions]], [[localization of an (∞,1)-category|Localizations]]). We will also discuss the perspective of reflexivity: since the theory speaks of itself (through directed [[univalence axiom|univalence]]), we can use it to justify new deduction rules that express the idea of working up to [[equivalence]] natively (e.g. we can produce a logic by rectifying the idea of having a locally cartesian type). In particular, this logic can be used to produce and study [[categorical semantics|semantic interpretations]] of [[HoTT]].
