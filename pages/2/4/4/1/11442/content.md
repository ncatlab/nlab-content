## Idea

A _Kan-fibrant simplicial manifold_ is a [[simplicial manifold]] (for instance [[simplicial object|simplicial]] [[topological manifold]] or simplicial [[smooth manifold]]) which satisfies a suitable analog of the [[Kan complex]]-condition on a [[simplicial set]].
(Typically, to get an interesting theory, Kan-fibrancy on simplicial manifolds is imposed in a suitable local sense, meaning that [[horns]] have continuous/smooth fillers in a  [[open neighbourhoods]] of all points, but possibly not globally.)

Motivated by the standard way (see at _[[homotopy hypothesis]]_) in which bare [[Kan complexes]] (hence Kan-fibrant [[simplicial sets]]) present [[geometrically discrete ∞-groupoids]] and given that the [[nerve]] of a [[Lie groupoid]] is an example of a locally Kan-fibrant simplicial manifold (a [[1-truncated]] one), such Kan-fibrant simplicial manifolds are often referred to _Lie $\infty$-groupoids_ (or _Lie $n$-groupoids_ for finite [[n-truncated object in an (infinity,1)-category|truncation]]) ([Zhu 06](#Zhu06)).

With such a suitably local definition, there should be the structure of a [[homotopical category]] on Kan-fibrant simplicial manifolds which embeds homotopically full and faithful into a local [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] over a suitable [[site]] of manifolds, hence such that this inclusion presents and [[full sub-(∞,1)-category]] of the [[(∞,1)-sheaf (∞,1)-topos]] over manifolds ("[[smooth ∞-groupoids]]"). 

Some care is needed in correctly interpreting the "Lie" condition in view of the [[homotopy theory]]. For instance _every_ [[∞-stack]] on the category of smooth manifolds ("[[smooth ∞-groupoid]]") is presented by a [[simplicial manifold]], just not in general by a suitably Kan-fibrant simplicial manifold ([NSS 12, section 2.2](#NSS12)).

A homotopy-correct characterization of the sub-$\infty$-category presented by the Kan-fribtant simplicial objects as that of _[[geometric ∞-stacks]]_ modeled on manifolds is in ([Pridham 09](#Pridham09)) (see around p. 17 for the differential geometric version).

Kan-fibrant simplicial manifolds have received particular attention as the result of [[Lie integration]] of [[L-∞ algebroids]]. See at _[[Lie integration]]_ for more on that.
