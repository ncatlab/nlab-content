#Idea#

A _locally modeled monoid_ or,  _$R$-Ring_, is a generalized quantity in the sense of [[space and quantity]] which is modeled on a [[category of local models]] $R$.

#Definition#

Let $(R,U,L,A)$ be a [[category of local models]]. Then an **$R$-ring** or **monoid locally modeled on $R$** is a co-[[presheaf]]
$$
  R \to Set
$$
which preserves the [[limits]] of shape in $L$.

A morphism of such locally modeled monoids is a [[natural transformation]].

#Examples#

* for $R = Ring^{op}$, $R$-rings are just ordinary rings.
* for $R = $ [[CartSp]], $R$-rings are [[generalized smooth algebra]]s.
