## Idea ##

An _irreducible representation_ --  often abbreviated _irrep_ -- is a [[representation]] that has no smaller non-trivial representations "sitting inside it".


## Definition ##

An _irreducible representation_ is a [[representation]] that has no nontrivial proper [[subobject]] in the [[category]] of all representations in question and yet which is not itself trivial either.  In other words, an irrep is a [[simple object]] in the category of representation.


## Remarks ##

There is also the closely related but in general different notion of an [[indecomposable representation]].  Every irrep is indecomposable, but the converse may fail.

A representation that has proper nontrivial subrepresentations but can not be decomposed into a [[direct sum]] of such representations is indecomposable but still reducible.
