I am a [[mathematics|mathematician]] specializing in the algebraic theory of [[topological quantum computation]], and the related underlying fields of pure mathematics. In particular, I am enthusiastic about the use of category theory to illuminate concepts in condensed matter physics and error correcting codes.
