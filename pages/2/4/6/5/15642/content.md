## Idea

Generally, a _functional equation_ is an [[equation]] between values of a [[function]] which serves to characterize that function.

Specifically one speaks of the functional equations which characterize the [[Riemann zeta function]], [[Jacobi theta functions]] and more generally [[zeta functions]], [[L-functions] and [[theta functions]].

There are various complementary approaches to the proof of the functional equation of an automorphic L-function. The first one, fully developed by Godement and Jacquet for the principal linear group, follows closely the approach explained in Tate's thesis, is given by the use of Poisson summation formula. Another one, explained in a quite general setting by Langlands, is given by evaluating at a given point the functional equation for Eisenstein series. A different but very important approach was developed by Rankin-Selberg for $GL_2$, and Piatetski-Shapiro and his school for more general groups, and has the advantage of allowing not only to get the functional equation, but also an important [[converse theorem]] that roughly says that an L-function is automorphic if and only if a given family of (Rankin-Selberg) L-functions
containing it fulfills the functional equation. This shows that automorphicity and the functional equation are deeply related, i.e., almost equivalent, when one formulates it precisely.
