##Idea##
'Homotopy 3-type' is a special case of [[homotopy n-type]] and you are referred to that entry for the generalities.

##Discussion##
There are many useful algebraic models for a homotopy 3-type. (Assume the homotopy type is connected for simplicity.)

* [[2-crossed module]] 

* [[crossed squares]] 

* [[cat 2-group]]

(Someone please add their favorite version of the Gray groupoid type model. I am not sure I know it well enough to do a good job of it. Also any others?)

* Gray group: a one-object groupoidal [[Gray category]] 

One measure of the usefulness of a given model may be its ease of calculation (e.g. with a generalised van Kampen theorem) and of extraction of topologically significant invariants. In the above a lot more is known, from this viewpoint, about the second and third model than for the first.
