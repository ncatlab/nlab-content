##Idea##
'Homotopy 3-type' is a special case of [[homotopy n-type]] and you are referred to that entry for the generalities.

##Discussion##
There are many useful algebraic models for a homotopy 3-type. (Assume the homotopy type is connected for simplicity.)

* [[2-crossed module]] All I will say here for the moment is that these are related to but not equivalent to the next two algebraic structures. So there is currently no higher homotopy van Kampen theorem with values in 2-crossed modules. 

* [[crossed squares]] 

* [[cat 2-group]]

(Someone please add their favorite version of the Gray groupoid type model. I am not sure I know it well enough to do a good job of it. Also any others?)
