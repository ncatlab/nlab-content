## Idea

Witten introduced two topological twists of a supersymmetric nonlinear [[sigma model]], which is a certain N=2 superconformal field theory attached to a compact [[Calabi-Yau variety]] $X$. One of them is the _B-model_ [[topological string]]; it is a 2-dimensional [[topological conformal field theory|topological N=1 superconformal field theory]]. In Kontsevich's version, instead of SCFT with Hilbert space, one assembles all the needed data in terms of [[Calabi-Yau category|Calabi-Yau A-infinity-category]] which is the A-infinity-category of coherent sheaves on the underlying variety. In fact only the structure of a derived category is sufficient (and usually quoted): it is now known (by the results of [[Dmitri Orlov]] and [[Valery Lunts]]) that under mild assumptions on the variety, a derived category of coherent sheaves has a unique [[enhanced triangulated category|enhancement]].

The B-model arose in considerations of [[string theory|superstring]]-propagation on Calabi--Yau varieties: it may be motivated by considering the [[vertex operator algebra]] of the 2d[[CFT|SCFT]] given by the N=2 supersymmetric nonlinear [[sigma-model]] with target $X$ and then changing the fields so that one of the super-[[Virasoro algebra|Virasoro]] generators squares to 0. The resulting "topologically twisted" algebra may then be read as being the [[BRST complex]] of a [[TCFT]].

One can also define a B-model for [[Landau-Ginzburg model|Landau?Ginzburg models]]. The category of [[D-brane|D-branes]] for the string --  the [[B-branes]] -- is given by the category of [[matrix factorization|matrix factorizations]] (this was proposed by Kontsevich and elaborated by Kapustin-Li; see also papers of Orlov). For the genus 0 closed string theory, see the work of Saito.

By [[homological mirror symmetry]], the B-model is dual to the  [[A-model]].

## Properties

### Second quantization / effective background field theory


The [[second quantization]] [[effective field theory]] defined by the [[perturbation series]] of the B-model is supposed to be "Kodaira-Spencer gravity" / "BVOC theory" in 6d ([BCOV 93](#BCOV93), [Costello-Li 12](#CostelloLi12), [Costello-Li 15](#CostelloLi15)).
