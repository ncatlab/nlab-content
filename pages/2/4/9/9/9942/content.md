## Idea

A [[localization of spectra|localization]] of the truncated [[Brown-Peterson spectrum]]. A form of [[Morava E-theory]].

## Properties

### Orientation

The [[orientation in generalized cohomology|orientation]] of [[Morava E-theory]] is discussed in ([Sati-Kriz 04](#SatiKriz04), [Buhn&#233; 11](#Buhne11)). It is essentially given by the vanishing of the seventh [[integral Stiefel-Whitney class]] $W_7$. 

Notice that this is in analogy to how [[orientation in generalized cohomology|orientation]] in [[complex K-theory]] is given by the vanishing third [[integral Stiefel-Whitney class]] $W_3$ ([[spin^c-structure]]).

Precisely:

###### Proposition

Let $X$ be a [[connected topological space|connected]] [[closed manifold]] of [[dimension]] 10 with [[spin structure]]. This is [[orientation in generalized cohomology|generalized oriented]] in second [[integral Morava K-theory]] $\tilde K(2)$ (for $p = 2$) precisely if its seventh [[integral Stiefel-Whitney class]] vanishes, $W_7(X) = 0$.

This is ([Buhn&#233; 11, prop. 8.1.13](#Buhne11)), following ([Sati-Kriz 04](#SatiKriz04)).

###### Proposition

Let $X$ be a [[connected topological space|connected]] [[closed manifold]] of [[dimension]] 10 with [[spin structure]]. This is [[orientation in generalized cohomology|generalized oriented]] in second Johnson-Wilons cohomology theory ([[Morava E-theory]]) $E(2)$ (for $p = 2$) precisely if its seventh [[integral Stiefel-Whitney class]] vanishes, $W_7(X) = 0$.
