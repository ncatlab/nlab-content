## Idea

A _connected graph_ is a [[graph]] where each [[pair]] of [[vertices]] is connected by a sequence of [[edges]]. 

For usual definitions of [[categories]] of graphs, this should be the [[connected objects]] in these categories.

## Examples

* In [[perturbative quantum field theory]] the [[formal power series]] of [[Feynman amplitudes]] labeled by [[Feynman diagrams]] which are connected graphs is called the _[[effective action]]_.
