## Idea

A _connected graph_ is a [[graph]] which is [[inhabited|non-empty]] and where each [[pair]] of [[vertices]] is connected by a sequence of [[edges]]. 

For usual definitions of [[categories]] of graphs, this should be the [[connected objects]] in these categories.

## Examples

* In [[perturbative quantum field theory]] the [[formal power series]] of [[Feynman amplitudes]] labeled by those [[Feynman diagrams]] whose underlying [[graphs]] are connected is called the _[[effective action]]_ $S_{eff}$. The [[exponential]] of the effective action then yields the full [[Feynman perturbation series]] over all Feynman diagrams. See at _[[S-matrix]]_ for more.
