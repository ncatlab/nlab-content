***


**Meeting time: Every Tuesday, 12:45-14:45 (plus epsilon)

**Place: Sitzungssaal,  [Page in studip](https://www.studip.uni-goettingen.de/dispatch.php/course/overview?cid=a829cf0bce827ed6bc8a6ae2413e96bf) for people at Gottingen, and its [Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/factorizationalgebras).

### Objectives ###

The aim of this seminar is bi-fold: to learn factorization algebra, and to understand perturbative quantum field theory. 

Quantum field theory is an amazing generating machine to obtain interesting mathematical objects (observables), and to relate different parts of math together. However, the mathematical formulation for full quantum field theory seems to be a quite formidable task. Nonetheless, interesting mathematical frameworks have been constructed and developed all the time. For example, topological field theories, (rational) conformal field theories, string field theories, mirror symmetries, Sieberg-Witten theory and Donaldson theory, and integrable systems. A common theme, behind those examples, is to capture the topological, algebraic or geometric invariants in various settings. Perhaps, this verifies why quantum field theory should be interesting to mathematicians.

It turns out, the very theme of looking for invariants also shows up in the development of factorization algebras. And more is true. The various axioms one would like to have in constructing a field theory, are naturally encoded in the definition of a factorization algebra. In this picture, it is quite natural to describe the classical and quantum observables in a coherent picture, and quantization is expected to be a kind of deformation. We are going to see how to materialize this during our seminar. Due to the deep impact from field theory to mathematics, this also means that we are going to revisit relevant mathematics from this new point of view, which includes, the theory of operads, Poisson geometry, vertex algebra, general and differential cohomology, index theorems, higher geometry, and dg-categories. 

Factorization algebra is broadly connected to different branches in mathematics, and attracts algebraists, geometers and tologists in general. It has both the abstract, higher point of view, and the down-to-earth calculation/applications. Thus it is a good arena to train our professional skills. We hope this seminar help us to

* review some important classical contents from the modern perspective,
* build up a common language to relate to each other's research topics,
* contribute to this exciting area from our own expertise.

### Prerequisite ###

Graduate-level courses on abstract algebra, differential geometry and topology. No knowledge on classical/quantum field theory is assumed. It would be good to have in mind some possible connections/applications of factorization algebras in your research topics. Or, if you are not sure at this point, feel free to raise up a discussion among the participants.

### Plan of Talks ###

We initiated the first several talks, which give a gentle introduction to the topic. The future talks will be the on more specific developments. 

* Oct. 21, 2014: Organization meeting. Why factorization algebra is interesting, and a brief account on the introduction chapter of Costello-Gwilliam (CG).

* Nov. 4, 2014: Prefactorization algebra by Chenchang. Definition, relation to $E_n$ operad theory (TFT) and functorial field theories ($\mathbf G$-FT). Associative algebras in quantum mechanics. CG: Chap 1, 3.

* Nov. 11, 2014: Continuation of Chenchang's prefactorization algebra: a description of quantum observables in free field theory through divergence operator, and a construction of $\mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{g})$. CG: Chap 2-3.

* Nov. 18, 2014: Examples of prefactorization algebras from field theories by Thomas. A finite dimensional analogy --- the divergence complex of a measure, Koszul resolution of the derived critical locus, and the relation to the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex of Heisenberg Lie algebra.  CG: Chap 4.1-4.2.

* Nov. 25, 2014: Continuation of free field theory by Thomas. Elliptic complexes, the homotopy equivalence between smooth and distributional sections, free field theories: classical observables and Poisson structure, quantum observables and the BD structure. CG: Chap 4.

* Dec. 2, 2014: An introduction to operads by Malte. $End$-operad, the definitions of (unital) operads, and algebras over operads. LV, F.

* Dec. 9, 2014: (1) A computation of 1d massive free scalars: quantum observables and Weyl algebra by Dorothea. CG: Chap 4.3. (2) $E_n$ operads and examples of $E_\infty$ operad by Malte. LV, F.

* Dec. 16, 2014: A talk on T-dualities by Bei. 

* Jan. 6, 2015: Factorization algebra by Dennis. Weiss cover and Ran space, descent condition with respect to three topologies (a la Beilinson-Drinfeld, Lurie and Costello-Gwilliam), (co)sheafification vs glue, a recast of $E_n$-algebras, locally constant factorization algebras and $E_n$-algebras are equivalent (as $(\infty,1)$-categories). Lurie: Chap 5, CG: Chap 6, Ginot: Chap 4.

* Jan. 13, 2015: Guest lecture by Owen Gwilliam. The general picture of QFT: classical field theory is about critical loci, while quantization involves integration over the critical loci plus that along the "normal directions". To deal with the singular critical loci, one considers the derived deformation theory. A family version of it leads to $L_\infty$ spaces. Derived loop spaces as an example. GG.

* Jan. 20, 2015: Quantum BV formalism (I) by Dennis. CG: Chap 13-14.

* Jan. 27, 2015: Quantum BV formalism (II) by Dorothea. CG: Chap 13-14.

* Feb. 3, 2015: TBA by Dmitri.

* Feb. 10, 2015:
