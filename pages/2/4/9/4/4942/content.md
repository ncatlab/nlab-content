## Idea

The definition of _geodesic convexity_ is like that of _[[convexity]]_ , but with straight lines in a [[Euclidean space]] generalized to [[geodesics]] in a [[Riemannian manifold]] or [[metric space]].

## Definition

### In a Riemannian manifold

Let $(X,g)$ be a [[Riemannian manifold]] and $C \subset X$ a [[subset]]. We say that $C$ is

* **weakly geodesically convex** if for any two points from $C$ there exists exactly one minimizing [[geodesic]] in $C$ connecting them;

* **geodesically convex** if for any two points in $C$ there exists exactly one minimizing geodesic in $X$ connecting them, and that geodesic arc lies completely in $C$

* **strongly geodesically convex** if for any two points in $C$ there exists exactly one minimizing geodesic in $X$ connecting them, and that geodesic arc lies completely in $X$; and furthermore there exists no nonminimizing geodesic inside $C$ connecting the two points.

### In a metric space

For $X$ a [[metric space]] ...
