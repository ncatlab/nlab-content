An *equivalence* of [[infinity-groupoids|$\infty$-groupoids]] is equivalently

* an [[equivalence in an (∞,1)-category|equivalence in the $(\infty,1)$-category]] [[∞Grpd]], 

* an [[equivalence of (∞,1)-categories]] between [[(∞,1)-categories]] that happen to be [[∞-groupoids]],

In terms of presentation by [[topological spaces]] or [[simplicial sets]] (see at *[[classical model structure on topological spaces]]* and [[classical model structure on simplicial sets]], respectively) this is: 

* a [[weak homotopy equivalence]]. 

If specifically presented by [[CW-complexes]] or [[Kan complexes]], respectively, it is 

* a [[homotopy equivalence]].
