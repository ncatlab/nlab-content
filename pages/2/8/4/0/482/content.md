The **kernel pair** of a morphism $f:X\to Y$ in a category $C$ is a pair of morphisms $R\,\rightrightarrows \, X$ which are a [[pullback]] of $f$ against itself, i.e. a limit of the diagram

$$Y \stackrel{f}{\to} X \stackrel{f}{\leftarrow} Y$$

The kernel pair is always an internal [[equivalence relation]] on $X$; informally, $\ker(f)$ is the subobject of $X \times X$ consisting of pairs of elements which have the same value under $f$ (sometimes called the 'kernel' of a function in $\Set$).

The [[coequalizer]] of the kernel pair, if it exists, is supposed to be the "object of equivalence classes" of the equivalence relation $\ker(f)$.
