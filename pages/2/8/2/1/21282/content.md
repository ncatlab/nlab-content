## Idea

In the [[standard model of particle physics]], the [[masses]] of the various [[flavour (particle physics)|flavors]] of [[quarks]], and thus of the [[hadron]] [[bound states]] built from them, differ by orders of magnitude ("mass hierarchy"):

* The [[up quark]] and [[down quark]] are both very light and of comparable mass.

* The [[strange quark]] is an order of magnitude heavier than the [[up quark|up]] and [[down quark|down]].

* The [[charm quark]] and [[bottom quark]] are two orders of magnitude heavier than the [[strange quark]].

* The [[top quark]] is another two orders of magnitude heavier than the bottom quark.

Since in the formulation of [[quantum hadrodynamics]] as [[chiral perturbation theory]] one needs to decide which quarks count as "approximately massless" and which count as "approximately of infinite mass" for the purpose of [[effective field theory]], it is very common to group the quark species into "light" and "heavy".

There are two versions of this grouping in use:

1. In "2-flavor"-[[chiral perturbation theory]] with [[SU(2)]] [[chiral symmetry]] 

* the [[up quark]] and [[down quark]] are regarded as light, 

* the [[strange quark]], [[charm quark]], [[bottom quark]] and [[top quark]] are regarded as heavy.

1. In "3-flavor"-[[chiral perturbation theory]] with [[SU(3)]] [[chiral symmetry]] 

* the [[up quark]], [[down quark]] and also the [[strange quark]] are regarded as light, 

* the [[charm quark]], [[bottom quark]] and [[top quark]] are regarded as heavy.


Either choice gives rise to a corresponding notion of light and heavy [[hadrons]].

For [[mesons]] one has:


1. In "2-flavor"-[[chiral perturbation theory]] with [[SU(2)]] [[chiral symmetry]]

* the [[pion]], [[omega-meson]] and [[rho meson]] are light (being [[bound states]] of [[up quarks]] and [[down quarks]]);

* the heavy mesons are the [[K-mesons]] (involving a [[strange quark]]), the [[D-mesons]] (involving a [[charm quark]]) and the [[B-mesons]] (involving a [[bottom quark]]) 

1. In "3-flavor"-[[chiral perturbation theory]] with [[SU(3)]] [[chiral symmetry]] 

* the [[pion]], [[omega-meson]], [[rho meson]] and [[K-mesons]] are light (being [[bound states]] of [[up quarks]], [[down quarks]] and [[strange quarks]]);

* the heavy mesons are the [[D-mesons]] (involving a [[charm quark]]) and the [[B-mesons]] (involving a [[bottom quark]]) 

For [[baryons]] one has:
