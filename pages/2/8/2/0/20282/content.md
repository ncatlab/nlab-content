## Definition

Given a [[topological space]] $X$, then a set of [[subsets]] $\{S_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ is _countably locally finite_ or _$\sigma$-locally finite_ if it is a countable union of [[locally finite set of subsets|locally finite sets of subsets]].

This property is used in [[Nagata-Smirnov metrization theorem]]:
