_Nonabelian algebraic topology_ is a program developed by [Ronnie Brown](http://www.bangor.ac.uk/~mas010/index.html) and his collaborators. The idea is to redo and enhance algebraic topology by making use of the tool of [[strict omega-groupoid]]s and in particular the [[crossed complex]]es equivalent to them, which generalize the complexes of _abelian_ groups traditionally used in algebraic topology.


#Remarks#

* Nonabelian algebraic topology in particular provides a context for and makes use of [[nonabelian cohomology]].

* One of the main motivations for the development of Nonabelian algebraic topology was the observation that the [Seifert-van Kampen theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seifert%E2%80%93van_Kampen_theorem) is most naturally understood as being not about homotopy groups, but about the [[fundamental groupoid|fundamental infinitity-groupoid]] of a space. Since the assignment of fundamental $\infty$-groupoids to spaces is an $\infty$-category valued co-presheaf, one can understand this in the context of [[nonabelian cosheaf homotopy]]. Remarks on this are in the blog entry [Codescent and the van Kampen theorem](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/nonabelian+cosheaf+homotopy).

#References#

Ronnie Brown has published a long series of articles over the years developing the ideas of nonabelian algebraic topology.

Currently a comprehensive **monograph** is in preparation on the subject of the algebraic topology of filtered spaces using [[crossed complex]]es and cubical [[omega groupoids]] with connections. It is not done yet, but if you email the author, maybe you can get a pdf copy of the latest version. A survey of that area is the Fields Institute article given below. 

Meanwhile, there is the website

The use of crossed complexes allows the notion of free crossed resolution, and so clear links with standard homological algebra. The place of strict $n$-fold groupoids in nonabelian  homological algebra needs much further work. One key is that the [[higher homotopy van Kampen theorem]] allows some algebraic information on gluing homotopy types, giving _some colimit information on nonabelian structures_. The traditional invariants, e.g. homotopy groups, $k$-invariants, ..., then have to be extracted from this larger structure.

This link is broken. Is there a current version? A quick Google search didn't find me anything useful.

*  [[Tim Porter]]:  Bangor's servers were 'got at' a short time ago and there seems to be maintenance almost every night, so try again.  The link worked for me but that may not be a good test!
