_Nonabelian algebraic topology_ is a program developed by [Ronnie Brown](http://www.bangor.ac.uk/~mas010/index.html) and his collaborators. The idea is to redo and enhance algebraic topology by making use of the tool of [[strict omega-groupoid]]s and in particular the [[crossed complex]]es equivalent to them, which generalize the complexes of _abelian_ groups traditionally used in algebraic topology.


#Remarks#

* Nonabelian algebraic topology in particular provides a context for and makes use of [[nonabelian cohomology]].

* One of the main motivations for the development of Nonabelian algebraic topology was the observation that the [Seifert-van Kampen theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seifert%E2%80%93van_Kampen_theorem) is most naturally understood as being not about homotopy groups, but about the [[fundamental groupoid|fundamental infinitity-groupoid]] of a space. Since the assignment of fundamental $\infty$-groupoids to spaces is an $\infty$-category valued co-presheaf, one can understand this in the context of [[nonabelian cosheaf homotopy]]. Remarks on this are in the blog entry [Codescent and the van Kampen theorem](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/nonabelian+cosheaf+homotopy).

#References#

Ronnie Brown has published a long series of articles over the years developing the ideas of nonabelian algebraic topology.

Currently a comprehensive **monograph** is in preparation on the subject of the algebraic topology of filtered spaces using [[crossed complex]]es and cubical [[omega-groupoid]]s with connections. It is not done yet, but if you email the author, maybe you can get a pdf copy of the latest version.

The use of crossed complexes allows the notion of free crossed resolution, and so clear links with standard homological algebra. The place of strict $n$-fold groupoids in nonabelian  homological algebra needs much further work. One key is that the [[higher homotopy van Kampen theorem]] allows some algebraic information on gluing homotopy types, giving _some colimit information on nonabelian structures_. The traditional invariants, e.g. homotopy groups, $k$-invariants, ..., then have to be extracted from this larger structure.
