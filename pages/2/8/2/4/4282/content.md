## Idea

A __$*$-algebra__ is an [[associative algebra|algebra]] $A$ ([[associative algebra|associative]] or [[nonassociative algebra|non-associative]]) equipped with an [[anti-involution]], meaning a map $(-)^\ast:A \to A$ such that 

* for all elements $a \in A$ and $b \in A$, $(a b)^\ast = b^\ast a^\ast$

* for all elements $a \in A$, $(a^\ast)^\ast = a$

## Definition

In more detail, begin with a [[commutative ring]] (often a [[field]], or possibly just a [[rig]]) $K$ equipped with an [[involution]] (a [[homomorphism]] whose square is the [[identity morphism|identity]]), written $x \mapsto \bar{x}$.  (The usual example for $K$ is the field of [[complex numbers]] with involution given by [[complex conjugation]], but the concept of $*$-algebra makes sense in more general contexts.  Note that we can take *any* commutative ring $K$ and simply define $\bar{x} \coloneqq x$.)

Then a __$K$-$*$-algebra__ (a $*$-algebra over $K$) is a $K$-[[module]] $A$ equipped with a $K$-[[bilinear map]] $A\times A \to A$, written as multiplication (and often assumed to be [[associativity|associative]]) and a $K$-[[antilinear map]] $A \to A$, written as $x \mapsto x^*$, such that

* $x^{**} = x$ for all $x$ in $A$ (so we have an [[involution]] on the underlying $K$-module), and
* $(x y)^* = y^* x^*$ for all $x,y$ in $A$ (so it is an [[anti-involution]] on $A$ itself).

The hypothesis that the anti-involution is $K$-antilinear means that $(r x)^* = \overline{r} x^*$ for all $r$ in $K$ and all $x$ in $A$ (as well as $(x + y)^* = x^* + y^*$).

If a $K$-$*$-algebra $A$ is itself commutative, then it is in particular a commutative ring with involution, and one can consider $A$-$*$-algebras as well.  On the other hand, a commutative ring with involution is simply a commutative $*$-algebra over the ring of [[integers]] (with trivial involution), and similarly for rigs and [[natural numbers]].


### $*$-Rings

A __$*$-ring__ is simply a $*$-algebra over the ring of [[integers]] (with trivial involution).  Similarly, a __$*$-rig__ is a $*$-algebra over the rig of [[natural numbers]].

Arguably, when we began this article with a commutative ring $K$ equipped with involution, we should have begun it with a ring with *anti*-involution instead.  However, since the ring (or rig) is commutative, there is no difference.


### Banach $*$-algebras

When $K$ is the field $\mathbb{C}$ of [[complex numbers]] (or the field $\mathbb{R}$ of [[real numbers]], with trivial involution), we can additionally ask that the $*$-algebra be a [[Banach algebra]]; then it is a __Banach $*$-algebra__.  Special cases of this are 

* $C^*$-[[C-star-algebra|algebras]] (aka $B^*$-algebras)

* and [[von Neumann algebras]] (aka $W^*$-algebras)

Arguably, one should require that the map $*$ be an [[isometry]] (which follows already if it is required to be [[short map|short]]); some authors require this and some don\'t.  However, this is automatic in the case of $C^*$-algebras (and hence also von Neumann algebras).


## Examples

### General
 {#General}

\begin{example}\label{TrivialStarStructure}
**(trivial star-structure)**\linebreak
Any plain [[algebra]] becomes a star-algebra by equipping it with the [[identity morphism|identity]] anti-involution.
\end{example}

\begin{example}\label{ComplexConjugation}
**([[complex conjugation]])**\linebreak
  The [[complex numbers]] -- regarded as an [[associative algebra]] over the [[real numbers]] -- form a star-algebra with anti-involution (which here  is an involution, since the product is [[commutative algebra|commutative]]) given by [[complex conjugation]].
\end{example}

\begin{example}
**([[Cayley-Dickson construction]])**
The [[Cayley-Dickson construction]] takes any star-algebra over the [[real numbers]] to a new star algebra.

Applied to the [[real numbers]] trivially regarded as a star-algebra (via Example \ref{TrivialStarStructure}), this yields, successively, the star-algebras of

* [[real numbers]] (Example \ref{TrivialStarStructure})

* [[complex numbers]] (Example \ref{ComplexConjugation})

* [[quaternions]]

* [[octonions]] 

(which are the four [[real normed division algebras]]) and then further the

* [[sedenions]]

* ...

In each case the star-operation may be thought of as [[complex conjugation]], given by changing the sign of the [[imaginary part]] and keeping the [[real part]] intact.

\end{example}

\begin{example}
**(operators on a [[Hilbert space]])**
The algebra of [[continuous operators]] on a [[Hilbert space]] is a star-algebra, with the [[Hermitian adjoint]] as the anti-involution.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
**([[C-star algebras]])**
A _[[C-star algebra]]_ is a star-algebra where the anti-involution is compatible with the [[norm]] of the underlying [[Banach algebra]].
\end{example}


### Involutive Hopf algebras
 {#InvolutiveHopfAlgebras}

\begin{example}\label{InvolutiveHopfAlgebrasAreStarAlgebras}
**([[involutive Hopf algebras]] are [[star-algebras]])** \linebreak
  Any [[involutive Hopf algebra]] is a star-algebra, with star-involution given by the [[antipode]] (by [this Prop.](Hopf+algebra#AntipodeIsAnAntihomomorphism)).
\end{example}

\begin{example}
**(groupoid algebras are star-algebras)**
  A [[group algebra]] and, more generally, a [[groupoid convolution algebra]], is a star-algebra, with the star-[[involution]] given by pullback along the [[inverse|inversion]] operation of the groupoid.

Yet more generally, the [[category convolution algebra]] of a [[dagger-category]] is a $*$-algebra, with the involution being the pullback along the $\dagger$ operation.

All these are [[involutive Hopf algebras]] (since taking [[inverses]] and taking [[dagger-category|dagger-operations]] squares to the identity) and as such are special cases of Example \ref{InvolutiveHopfAlgebrasAreStarAlgebras}
\end{example}

\begin{example}\label{StarAlgebraOfHorizontalChordDiagrams}
**(star-algebra of [[horizontal chord diagrams]])** \linebreak
The algebra of [[horizontal chord diagrams]] is a star-algebra under reversal of orientation of strands (see [here](horizontal+chord+diagram#StarAlgebraStructure), [CSS 21, Prop. 2.9](#CSS21)).

Since [[horizontal chord diagrams are the homology of the loop space of configuration space]] and the [[homology of a loop space]] is an [[involutive Hopf algebra]], this is a special case of Example \ref{InvolutiveHopfAlgebrasAreStarAlgebras}.
\end{example}
