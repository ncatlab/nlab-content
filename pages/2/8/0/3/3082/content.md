The approximate homotopy lifting property is a weaker notion of the [[homotopy lifting property]] (in the setup of metric spaces). 

A [[proper map]] $p:E\to B$ between [[locally compact space|locally compact]] metric [[absolute neighborhood retract]]s (ANRs) is satisfying the **approximate homotopy lifting property** for space $X$ if for any open covering $U$ of B, and a map $h : X\to E$, a homotopy $H : X \times I \to B$ such that $p\circ h = H_0$, there exists a homotopy $G : X\times I\to E$ such that $G_0 = h$ and the maps $p\circ G$ and $H$ are $U$-close. 

A proper map $p : E\to B$ between locally compact metric ANR's is an **approximate fibration** if $p$ has the approximate homotopy lifting property for all metric spaces. 

It is straightfoward to generalize this notion to the level maps of inverse systems of locally compact metric ANR's.
