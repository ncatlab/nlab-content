## Idea

_Topos theory_ is the part of [[category theory]] that studies [[categories]] which are [[topos]]es. This includes in particular [[Grothendieck toposes]], i.e. [[categories of sheaves]].

There are always two ways to think of topos theory: as being

* about [[logic]]

* about [[higher geometry|geometry]].


## Related concepts

* **topos theory**

* [[2-topos theory]]

* [[(∞,1)-topos theory]]

* [[higher topos theory]]

* [[microlocal sheaf theory]]

A standard textbook on this case is

* [[Saunders MacLane]], [[Ieke Moerdijk]], _[[Sheaves in Geometry and Logic]]_

Introducing even category theory from the scratch while still managing to cover considerable ground, the following textbook is the _royal road to topos theory_ for people with some background in [[first-order logic]]:
