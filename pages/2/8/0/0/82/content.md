## Idea

_Topos theory_ is the part of [[category theory]] that studies [[categories]] which are [[topos]]es. This includes in particular [[Grothendieck topos]]es, i.e. [[categories of sheaves]].

There are always two ways to think of topos theory: as being

* about [[logic]]

* about [[higher geometry|geometry]].


## Related concepts

* **topos theory**

* [[2-topos theory]]

* [[(âˆž,1)-topos theory]]

* [[higher topos theory]]
