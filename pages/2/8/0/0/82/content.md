See the linked keyword lists at the entries on

* [[Categories and Sheaves]] -- category and sheaf theory for geometrical applications (no logic, no topos)

* [[Sheaves in Geometry and Logic]] -- category and sheaf theory with an emphasis on logical and topos-theoretical applications

* [[Elephant]] -- topos theory
