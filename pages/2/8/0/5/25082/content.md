## Idea

In [[constructive mathematics]], the axiom of **decidable choice** ought to be a weak form of the [[axiom of choice]] which states that every [[set]] with [[decidable equality]] is a [[projective object]] in [[Set]]. 

Decidable choice implies [[countable choice]] because the [[natural numbers]] have decidable equality. By [BauerSwan18](#BauerSwan18) there is a [[topos]] (the [[function realizability]] topos, which moreover satisfies [[Markov's principle]] and other axioms) [[internal logic|in which]] all sets with decidable equality are [[countable set|countable]] (admit a surjection from a [[decidable subset]] of $\mathbb{N}$), so decidable choice coincides with countable choice. Conversely, in the context of [[excluded middle]], decidable choice is the same as the full [[axiom of choice]], because every set has [[decidable equality]] in the context of excluded middle.
