Algebraic K-theory is the study of [[K-theory]] of categories more general than that of (bounded [[chain complex]]es of) [[vector bundle]]s on a [[topological space]], which is the topic of [[topological K-theory]].

In its simple form _algebraic K-theory_ provides tools for computing the [[Grothendieck group]] of suitable categories. In its more refined form it studies the [[K-theory spectrum]] assigned to these categories. Crucuial tools for this go by the name [[Q-construction]] and [[Waldhausen S-construction]].

Types of categories for which a theory of algebraic K-theory exist include notable the notions

* [[Quillen exact category]] 

* [[abelian category]]

* [[Waldhausen category]], 

* [[triangulated category]].

Concrete examples of interest include for instance

* the category of finitely generated [[projective object]]s over a unital $k$-[[associative unital algebra|algebra]], 

* the category of [[coherent sheaf|coherent sheaves]] over a [[noetherian ring|noetherian]] [[scheme]],

* the category of locally free sheaves over a scheme, 

and the like. 

When one talks about the algebraic $K$-theory of [[ring]]s, one means the algebraic $K$-theory of the corresponding category of (one-sided) finitely-generated projective [[module]]s.

A K-theory should be given by a sequence of [[functor]]s $K_i$ from some class of categories as above to [[abelian group]]s having some similarity to [[derived functor]]s and [[cohomology]] theory for spaces. $K_0$ and $K_1$ are rather classical objects from the 1950s; higher $K$-groups are defined by Quillen in two steps: to a [[Quillen exact category]] $C$ one first associates a $K$-theory space $\mathcal{K}(C)$ (or in better versions, a $K$-theory [[spectrum]]) and then defines $K$-groups as [[homotopy group]]s of that space:
$$K_i(C)=\pi_i(\mathcal{K}(C)).$$  

The $K$-theory space of $C$ in Quillen's version was obtained as a [[classifying space]] of the Quillen $Q$-construction applied to $C$. The $Q$-construction has been refined to more sophisticated [[delooping]] methods by Waldhausen, Karoubi and others.
