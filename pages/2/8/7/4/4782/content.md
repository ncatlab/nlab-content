[[Chen Ning Yang]] writes in  _C. N. Yang, Selected papers, 1945-1980, with commentary_, W. H. Freeman and Company, San Francisco, 1983, on p. 567:

> In 1975, impressed with the fact that [[gauge fields]] are [[connection on a bundle|connections]] on [[fiber bundles]], I drove to the house of [[Shiing-shen Chern|S. S. Chern]] in El Cerrito, near Berkeley... I said I found it amazing that [[gauge theory]] are exactly [[connection on a bundle|connections]] on [[fiber bundles]], which the mathematicians developed without reference to the physical world. I added: "this is both thrilling and puzzling, since you mathematicians dreamed up these concepts out of nowhere." He immediately protested: "No, no. These concepts were not dreamed up. They were natural and real."
