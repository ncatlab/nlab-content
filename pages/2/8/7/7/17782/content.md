## Idea

A _pp-wave spacetime_ is a [[spacetime]], i.e. an exact solution to [[Einstein's equations]] for [[gravity]], containing nothing but [[radiation]] ([[gravitational waves]] and/or [[electromagnetic waves]]) with one fixed [[wave vector]].

The [[Ricci flat]] pp-wave spacetimes are examples of [[universal spacetimes]].

## Properties

### As Penrose limits

Every [[spacetime]] looks like a pp-wave near a [[lightlike]] [[geodesic]]. This is called the _Penrose limit_. (see [Blau 11](#Blau11))


### Relation to BMN matrix model

The _[[BMN matrix model]]_ ([BMN 02, Section 5 and Appendix B](#BerensteinMaldacenaNastase02)) is a deformation of the [[BFSS matrix model]] by [[mass]]-terms which correspond to a deformation of the [[Minkowski spacetime]] background to a [[pp-wave spacetime]].
