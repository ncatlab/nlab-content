A __subalgebra__ is a [[subobject]] in a [[category of algebras]].

That is to say, a subalgebra of an [[associative algebra]] $A$ is a [[subset]] of $A$ that is closed under the operations of [[addition]] and  [[multiplication]], and contains all elements of the [[base ring]].

For other types of [[algebras]], such as [[algebras over operads]], [[algebras for endofunctors]], [[algebras over monads]], [[algebras over algebraic theories]], the notion of subalgebra is defined as a subobject in the corresponding category of algebras.
