An __$E_\infty$-ring__ is a commutative $A_\infty$-[[A-infinity-ring|ring]]: an [[algebra over an operad|algebra]] over the [[E-infinity operad]] in [[chain complex]]es of [[abelian group]]s.

This should be the same thing as a [[commutative ring spectrum]].

Is this term usually defined differently or used in a different context, or should we redirect?

[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: I am not sure. The good answer to this might depend on a similar question which I have at [[A-infinity ring]]: to which extent is an algebra object in a monoidal $(\infty,1)$-category the same as an algebra for the corresponding operad. Probably more on this is in the PhD thesis of J. Francis.

_Toby_:  I\'ll say no, don\'t redirect, since at least there are different definitions.  But yeah, we should figure out how they\'re equivalent.
