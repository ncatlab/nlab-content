## Idea

A [[dualizable object]] in a [[symmetric monoidal (∞,n)-category]] is called **fully dualizable** if the structure maps of the duality unit and counit each themselves have adjoints, which have adjoints, and so on.

## Properties

By the [[cobordism hypothesis]]-theorem, symmetric monoidal [[(∞,n)-functor]]s out of the [[(∞,n)-category of cobordisms]]s are characterized by their value on the point, which is a fully dualizable object.
