## Idea

In [[FQFT]]-language, 
as a ([[prequantum field theory|pre]]-)[[quantum field theory|quantum]] [[field theory]] in [[dimension]] $n$ is given by a functor on an [[(infinity,n)-category of cobordisms]], so a field theory with boundaries/[[branes]] is given by such a  functor on an $(\infty,n)$-category of cobordisms with marked [[boundaries]]. The assignments to the boundary data itself defines a kind of field theory of one dimension lower, which is the corresponding boundary field theory. 

If the [[field theory]] is thought of as a [[sigma-model]] that describes the [[quantum mechanics]] of a [[particle]] or [[string]] or [[membrane]], etc., then the boundary condition is also called a _[[brane]]_ for that [[sigma-model]].
