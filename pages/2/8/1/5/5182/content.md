## Idea

A [[model category]] structure on a category of [[spectra]] presents a [[stable (∞,1)-category]] of [[spectrum objects]].

Typically and naturally, a model structure on spectra forms a [[stable model category]]. In good cases it also forms a [[symmetric monoidal model category]] with respect to the [[smash product of spectra]], see at _[[symmetric monoidal smash product of spectra]]_.

## Examples

A classical 

* [[model structure on sequential spectra]] 

in [[simplicial sets]], not however with a symmetric monoidal smash product, is ([Bousfield-Friedlander 78](#BousfieldFriedlander78)) the 

* _[[Bousfield-Friedlander model structure]]_, 

with its analogue in [[topological spaces]], the

* [[classical model structure on topological sequential spectra]].

Thes are related by a [[zig-zag]] of [[Quillen equivalences]] to the 

* _[[model structure on combinatorial spectra]]_.

A [[Quillen equivalence|Quillen equivalent]] model structure to the model structures on sequential spectra that does carry a [[symmetric monoidal smash product of spectra]] is the

* _[[model structure for excisive functors]]_.

This models spectra as [[enriched functors]] on the site of [[pointed homotopy type|pointed]] [[finite homotopy types]]. Restricting that to smaller sub-sites, yields model structures for "[[highly structured spectra]]" with a [[symmetric monoidal smash product of spectra]]: the

* [[model structure on orthogonal spectra]],

* [[model structure on symmetric spectra]],

A unified treatment and comparison of these is in

* [[Model categories of diagram spectra]]

Then there is also the

* [[model structure on S-modules]].
