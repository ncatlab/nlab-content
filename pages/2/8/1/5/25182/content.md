## Idea

In [[dependent type theory]], the term *typal equality* is used to describe the use of the [[identity type]] to represent the notion of equality of terms, and is primarily used to distinguish from the notion of [[judgmental equality of terms]]. 

In dependent type theories with a separate [[proposition]] [[judgment]] $\phi \mathrm{prop}$, the term *typal equality* is also used to distinguish identity types from [[propositional equality]], which is the equality judged to be a proposition; i.e. $a =_A b \mathrm{prop}$. On the other hand, in dependent type theory without a separate [[proposition]] [[judgment]], propositions are usually defined to be certain types, and the term "propositional equality" is used as a synonym of typal equality in referring to identity types.  (In fact, "propositional equality" is the older and arguably still more common term in this context.)
