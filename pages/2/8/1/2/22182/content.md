## Idea

The _circle type_ is an [[axiom|axiomatization]] of the [[homotopy type]] of the ([[shape modality|shape]] of) the [[circle]] in the context of [[homotopy type theory]].

## Definition

As a [[higher inductive type]], the circle is given by

    Inductive Circle : Type
      | base : Circle
      | loop : Id Circle base base

This says that the type is inductively constructed from 

1. a [[term]] of circle type whose [[semantics|interpretation]] is as the [[base point]] of the circle, 

1. a term of the [[identity type]] of paths between these two terms, which interprets as the 1-cell of the circle

   $$
     base \stackrel{loop}{\to} base
     \,
   $$

   Hence a non-constant path from the base point to itself.

### As a suspension

The circle type could also be defined as the [[suspension type]] $\Sigma \mathbf{2}$ of the type of [[booleans]] $\mathbf{2}$. 

### As a coequalizer

The circle type could also be defined as the [[coequalizer type]] of any two [[endofunctions]] on the [[unit type]]

$$\mathbf{1} \rightrightarrows \mathbf{1} \to S^1$$

### Using torsors ###

The circle can also be defined without HITs using only univalence, as the type of $\mathbb{Z}$-torsors.  One can then prove that this type satisfies the same induction principle (propositionally).  This is due to [[Dan Grayson]].

## Properties ##

Its [[induction principle]] says that for any $P:S^1\to Type$ equipped with a point $base' : P(base)$ and a [[dependent identification|dependent path]] $loop':base'= base'$, there is $f:\prod_{(x:S^1)} P(x)$ such that:

$$f(base)=base'\qquad apd_f(loop) = loop'$$

As a special case, its [[recursion principle]] says that given any type $X$ with a point $x:X$ and a loop $l:x=x$, there is $f:S^1 \to X$ with 

$$f(base)=x\qquad ap_f(loop)=l$$

### $\Omega(S^1)=\mathbb{Z}$ ###

There are several proofs in the [[HoTT book]] that the [[loop space]] $\Omega(S^1)$ of the circle is the [[integers]] $\mathbb{Z}$.  (Any such proof requires the [[univalence axiom]], since without that it is consistent that $S^1$ is contractible.  Indeed, $S^1$ is contractible if and only if [[UIP]] holds.)
