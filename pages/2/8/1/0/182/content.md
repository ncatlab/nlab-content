#Definition#


A _graded-cocommutative codifferential coalgebra_ is a cocommutative [[coalgebra|comonoid]] in the category of chain complexes (of modules over some ring).

We write $CoDGCA$ for the [[category]] of such codifferential coalgebras.

##Remarks##


* Codifferential coalgebras whose underlying graded-cocommutative coalgebra is free over a complex of vector spaces in positive degree are [[L-infinity-algebra|Lie infinity-algebra]]s.
