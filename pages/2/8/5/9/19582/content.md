## Idea

There is a sensible [[theory (physics)|theory]] of [[supergravity]] in a total of 12 [[spacetime]] [[dimensions]]. Even though this requires an exotic non-[[Lorentzian signature]] of $(10,2)$ (hence with a "2-dimensional [[time]]") it has been argued that this is a better starting point for obtaining low-dimensional [[supergravity]] theory by [[KK-compactification]], since it yields some lower-dimensional theories that are missed when starting with [[11-dimensional supergravity]], notably [[type IIB supergravity]] in 10 dimensions, hence relates to [[F-theory]] as [[11-dimensional supergravity]] relates to [[M-theory]] (e.g. [Nishino 97b](#Nishino97b), [Hewson 97](#Hewson97)). (A theory in $(9,3)$ signature has also been proposed in ([Kriz 05](#Kriz05)).)

It is an oft-repeated [[folklore]] that the highest number of [[spacetime]] [[dimensions]] for [[supergravity]] to make sense is 11, realized by [[11-dimensional supergravity]]. However, there are some assumptions that go into this conclusion. First of all, the argument goes that after [[KK-compactification]] to 4-dimensions there must not appear [[supermultiplets]] with [[mass]]-less fields of [[spin]] $\gt 2$, since another [[folklore]] argument states that [[quantum field theory]] in $3+1$ dimensions with fields of spin larger than 2 is inconsistent. 

(This in turn needs further qualification: Consistent [[quantum field theory]] with an _infinite tower_ of higher spin fields _is_ consistent, this is called _[[higher spin gauge theory]]_ arising as the vanishing [[string tension]]-[[limit of a sequence|limit]] of [[string field theory]]. Ever since this discovery, the modified [[folklore]] is that field theories with a finite number of higher spin fields is inconsistent.)

Since acting with a [[supersymmetry]] generator on elements of a [[supermultiplet]] increases spin by 1/2, this argument requires that there are at most $(2 - (-2)) \times 2 = 8$ super charges in (3+1)d, hence corresponding to [[N=8 d=4 supergravity]]. 

This, in turn, requires, by the rules of [[KK-compactification]], that 

1. there be only a single supercharge in dimension $10+1$, since the [[irreducible representation|irreducible]] [[real spin representation]] of $Spin(10,1)$ has real dimension 32, which [[branching rule|branches]] as $\mathbf{32} \mapsto 8 \cdot \mathbf{4}$ under $Spin(3,1) \hookrightarrow Spin(10,1)$;

1. there cannot be any supercharge in dimension $11+1$, since the [[irreducible representation|irreducible]] [[real spin representation]] of $Spin(11,1)$ has real dimension 64, which [[branching rule|branches]] as $\mathbf{64} \mapsto 16 \cdot \mathbf{4}$ under $Spin(3,1) \hookrightarrow Spin(11,1)$.

However, the second conclusion here is evaded by a change of [[spacetime signature]]: The [[irreducible representation|irreducible]] [[real spin representation]] of $Spin(10,2)$ still happens to be of dimension 32 and still [[branching rule|branches]] as $\mathbf{32} \mapsto 8 \cdot \mathbf{4}$.


## Properties

### The $2+1$-brane in $10+2$ dimensions
 {#The21Brane}

There is supposed to be a consistent fundamental [[super p-brane]] on $10+2$-dimensional supergravity backgrounds, whose [[double dimensional reduction]] yields the [[M2-brane]] in [[11-dimensional supergravity]] and further the [[superstrings]] not just of [[type IIA supergravity]] but also (?) of [[type IIB supergravity]]. The [[worldvolume]] of this [[p-brane]] has 4 spacetime dimensions with signature $(2,2)$. Therefore some authors refer to this as a "2+2"-brane, even though this does not mesh well with the naming convention of $p$-branes in Lorentzian signature. Since Lorentzian $p$-branes have $(p+1)$-dimensional worldvolume, the systematic naming here would be "2+1"-brane.
