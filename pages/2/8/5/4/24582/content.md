## Idea

XTT is an [[extensional type theory|extensional]] [[cubical type theory]] developed by [[Jonathan Sterling]], [[Carlo Angiuli]], and [[Daniel Gratzer]]. 

[[UIP]] is a theorem of [[XTT]], rather than an axiom as in [[Martin-LÃ¶f type theory]]. As a result, it is an example of a [[cubical type theory]] which is not a [[homotopy type theory]]. 

Additionally, XTT has [[regularity]], [[canonicity]], decidable type checking, and certain [[higher inductive types]] like [[propositional truncation]]. It is an open question if it additionally has [[strong normalization]].
