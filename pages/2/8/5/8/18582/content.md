## Idea

A [[local Lagrangian density]] $L \in \Omega^{p+1,0}(E)$ on a [[jet bundle]] $J^\infty(E)$ of some [[field bundle]] $E \to \Sigma$ induces a differential form 

$$
  \theta \in \Omega^{p,1}(E)
$$

unique up to terms in the image of the  [[horizontal derivative]], given by

$$
  d L = \delta_{EL} L + d_H \theta
  \,,
$$

where $\delta_{EL}$ is the [[Euler-Lagrange operator]]. Its image under the [[vertical derivative]]

$$
  \omega \coloneqq d_V \theta \in \Omega^{p,2}(E)
$$

is called the _pre-symplectic current_. This is because for any choice of $p$-dimensional submanifold $\Sigma_p \hookrightarrow \Sigma$, the [[transgression]] of $\omega$ to $\Sigma_p$ is a [[presymplectic form]] on the on-shell [[space of sections]] on the [[formal normal neighbourhood]] of $\Sigma_p$. This is the _[[covariant phase space]]_.
