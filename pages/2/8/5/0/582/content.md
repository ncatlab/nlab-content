# Definition #

A **regular monomorphism** is a [[morphism]] which occurs as the [[equalizer]] of some parallel pair of morphisms.  Every such morphism is automatically a [[monomorphism]].

# Examples #

* In [[Set]], or more generally in any [[pretopos]], every monic is regular.

* In [[Top]], the monics are the injective functions, while the regular monics are the subspace inclusions (that is, injective functions whose source has the topology induced from their target).

* In [[Grp]], the monics are (up to isomorphism) the inclusions of subgroups, while the regular monics are the inclusions of _normal_ subgroups.

* In [[Ab]], or more generally any [[abelian category]], every monomorphism is regular.
