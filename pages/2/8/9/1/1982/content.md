## Idea

Measure theory studies [[measurable spaces]] and [[measure spaces]].


## History

Measure theory is the field of mathematics that grew out of the [[Lebesgue measure|Lebesgue integral]] and Kolmogorov\'s axioms for [[probability]].  


## Categories of measure theory

From the [[nPOV]], it is desirable to have a good [[category]] for [[measure theory]].

The article [[categories of measure theory]] provides evidence that the category of compact strictly localizable [[enhanced measurable spaces]] captures the desired features of measure theory as presented in common textbooks on real analysis.

## Some subfields, related fields, and applications

The general measure theory studies general notions and constructions in measure theory, like the connection to integration, the measure spaces, derivation by measure, [[Caratheodory construction]] and so on.

[[probability theory|Probability theory]] studies special class of measures, so called [[probability measure|probability measures]] which are normalized to unity.

Measure theory is very much having a central role in studying so called [[ergodic theory]] of dynamical systems.

[[geometric measure theory|Geometric measure theory]] is the geometric study of measures of subsets of Euclidean space and the measure theoretic aspects of various geometric objects, like the integration of classes of currents and their extremization properties.    

There is a generalization, the noncommutative measure theory, which is more or less the study of [[von Neumann algebras]], see [Connes (1995)](#Connes1995).
