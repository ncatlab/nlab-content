## Idea

*Zero-one measures* are [[measures]] whose only values are [[zero]] and [[one]]. 

In [[probability theory]], they model situations which "are not really random", where we are almost surely certain of which events take place and which do not. 
They are used in [[categorical probability]] to model situations of [[ergodicity]].

They also form a [[monad]], which is analogous to [[sober topological space|sobrification of topological spaces]].

The analogous concept for [[Markov kernels]] is a [[zero-one kernel]].


## Definition

A [[probability measure]] $p$ on a [[measurable space]] $X$ is said to be **zero-one**, **irreducible** or **extremal** if and only if any of the following equivalent conditions hold:

* For every event (measurable subset) $A$ of $X$, 
$$
p(A) \;=\; 0 \qquad or \qquad p(A) \;=\; 1 .
$$
* Every event (measurable subset) $A$ of $X$ is [[conditional independence|independent]] of itself:
$$
p(A) \;=\; p(A\cap A) \;=\; p(A)\,p(A) .
$$
* $p$ cannot be expressed as a nontrivial [[convex combination]] of other probability measures: if
$$
p \;=\; \lambda\,q_1 + (1-\lambda)\,q_2
$$
for $\lambda\in(0,1)$ and $q_1,q_2\in P X$, then $q_1=q_2=q$.
(This can be seen as analogous to [[irreducible closed sets]].)
* For every $f,g:X\to\mathbb{R}$ for which the integrals below exist, integration with $p$ preserves multiplication:
$$
\int_X f\cdot g\,dp \;=\; \left( \int_X f\,dp \right) \cdot \left( \int_X g\,dp \right) .
$$


## Examples

* Every [[Dirac measure|Dirac delta]] measure is zero-one: 
$$
\delta_x(A) \;=\; 1_A(x) \;=\; \begin{cases}
1 & x\in A ; \\
0 & x\notin A .
\end{cases}
$$
If $X$ is [[standard Borel]], or more more generally a [[sober measurable space]], every zero-one measure on $X$ is a Dirac delta.

* Every [[ergodic measure]] is zero-one when restricted to the [[invariant sigma-algebra]]. 


## Further properties

* Zero-one measures are exactly the [[law of a random variable|laws]] of those [[random variables]] which satisfy a [[zero-one law]].

* Zero-one kernels are exactly the [[Markov category#deterministic_morphisms|deterministic states]] of [[Stoch]], in the sense of [[Markov categories]].
