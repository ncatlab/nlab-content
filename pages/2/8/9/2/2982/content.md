##  Idea

The _associative operad_ $Assoc$ is the [[operad]] whose [[algebras over an operad]] are [[monoid]]s: objects equipped with an [[associative]] and [[unital]] binary operation.

## Definition

### As a $Vect$-operad

The _associative operad_, denoted $Ass$ or $Assoc$, is often taken to be the [[Vect]]-[[operad]] whose [[algebra over an operad|algebras]] are precisely [[associative unital algebras]].

### As a $Set$-operad

As a [[Set]]-enriched [[planar operad]], $Assoc$ is the operad that has precisely one single $n$-ary operation for each $n$.  Accordingly, $Assoc$ in this sense is the [[terminal object]] in the [[category]] of [[planar operads]].

As a [[Set]]-enriched [[symmetric operad]] $Assoc$ has (the set underlying) the [[symmetric group]] $\Sigma_n$ in each degree, with the [[action]] being the action of $\Sigma_n$ on itself by multiplication from one side.

Similarly, as a _planar_ [[dendroidal set]], $Assoc$ is the [[presheaf]] that assigns the singleton to every [[planar tree]] (hence also the [[terminal object]] in the category of dendroidal sets).

But, by the above, as an ordinary/symmetric debdroidal set, $Assoc$ is not the terminal object.

## Properties

### Resolution

The relative [[Boardman-Vogt resolution]] $W([0,1],I_* \to Assoc)$ of $Assoc$ in [[Top]] is [[Jim Stasheff]]'s version of the [[A-∞ operad]] whose [[algebra over an operad|algebras]] are [[A-∞ algebras]].
