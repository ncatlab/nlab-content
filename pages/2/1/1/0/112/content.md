## Definition

A [[category]] consists of a collection of **objects** together with [[morphisms]] between these objects.  Thus, naively, we may think of objects 
as the '[[elements]]' of a category.  

More generally, in [[higher category theory]] the objects of an [[(n,r)-category]] are the 0-dimensional cells of that structure.


## Examples


* if a [[set]] is regarded as a [[discrete category]] (with no nontrivial morphisms) then the objects of that category are precisely the elements of the set:

* in the [[fundamental groupoid]] $\Pi_1(X)$ of a [[topological space]] $X$, the objects are the points of $X$.


* in the category [[Set]], the objects are sets; in [[Vect]] the objects are [[vector space]]s in [[Top]] the objects are [[topological space]]s, etc.

More generally, in [[higher category theory]] the objects of an [[(n,r)-category]] are the 0-dimensional cells of that structure.

For instance

* if a [[simplicial set]] that is a [[Kan complex]] is regarded as an [[∞-groupoid]], then its vertices are the objects of that $\infty$-groupoid;

* similarly if a simplicial set that is a [[quasi-category]] is regarded as an incarnation of an [[(∞,1)-category]], then its vertices are the objects of that $(\infty,1)$-category,

* if a [[globular set]] is equipped with the structure of a [[strict ∞-category]], then its 0-cells are the objects of that [[∞-category]].
