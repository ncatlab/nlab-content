__Associative dialgebra__ is an algebraic structure introduced by Loday and Pirashvili to formalize the structure for the universal enveloping of a [[Leibniz algebra]].

Associative dialgebras are algebras over a Koszul quadratic operad whose Koszul dual is the operad of [[dendriform dialgebra]]s. In the standard presentation, 
associative dialgebras have two algebraic operations.
