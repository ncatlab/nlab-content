## Idea

A **higher coinductive type** is a version of a [[coinductive type]] in which the input of a method is a higher-dimensional version of itself, dually to how a [[higher inductive type]] has constructors whose output is a higher-dimensional version of itself. 

As a result, higher [[coinductive]] types typically require context modification rules which replace [[variables]] with higher-dimensional cubes (see e.g. [here](https://github.com/gwaithimirdain/narya/issues/66#issuecomment-2840396249)). 

## Examples

* The [[amazing right adjoint]] of a specified type $T$ is a higher coinductive type $1/T$ cogenerated by a 1-dimensional field $\mathrm{root}$ in $T$. 

* The fibrancy predicate in [[higher observational type theory]] is a higher coinductive type using [[bridge types]] cogenerated by 
  * two [[transport]] functions, 

  * two dependent functions which give witness that each element is heterogeneously bridged with its transported version, 

  * a witness that heterogeneous bridge types of fibrant types are also fibrant
