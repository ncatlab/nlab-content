## Idea

In [[string theory]]/[[M-theory]], the _shifted C-field flux quantization condition_ is a [[charge quantization]]-condition on the [[supergravity C-field]] expected in [[M-theory]]. 

## For the magnetic $G_4$-flux

For the magnetic $G_4$-flux, the shifted flux quantization says that the [[real cohomology]] class of the [[flux density]] ([[field strength]]) [[differential 4-form]] $G_4 \in \Omega^4(X)$ on [[spacetime]] $X$ becomes integral after shifted by one quarter of the [[first Pontryagin class]], hence the condition that with the shifted 4-flux density defined as

\[
  \label{Shiftwed}
  \widetilde G_4 
  \;\coloneqq\;
  G_4 + \tfrac{1}{4}p_1(\nabla_{T X})
  \;\in\;
  \Omega^4(X)
\]

(for $\nabla_{T X}$ any [[affine connection]] on [[spacetime]], in particular the [[Levi-Civita connection]]) we have (using the [[de Rham theorem]] to translate from [[de Rham cohomology]] to [[real cohomology]]) that $\widetilde G_4$ represents an [[integral cohomology]]-class:

$$
  [\widetilde G_4]
  \;\in\;
  H^4(X, \mathbb{Z})
  \overset{H^4(X, \mathbb{Z}\hookrightarrow \mathbb{R})}{\longrightarrow}  
  H^4(X, \mathbb{R})
  \,.
$$


This condition was originally argued for in ([Witten 96a](#Witten96a), [Witten 96b](#Witten96b)) as a sufficient condition for ensuring that the [[prequantum line bundle]] for the [[7d Chern-Simons theory]] on an [[M5-brane]] [[worldvolume]] is divisible by 2.

Proposals for encoding this condition by a [[Wu class]]-shifted variant of [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology theory|stable]] [[ordinary differential cohomology]] were considered in [Hopkins-Singer 02](#HopkinsSinger02), [Diaconescu-Freed-Moore 03](#DiaconescuFreedMoore03), [FSS 12](#FSS12).

It turns out that the shifted flux quantization condition on the C-field is naturally implied ([FSS1 19b, Prop. 4.12](#FSS19b)) by the requirement that $G_4$ is the differential form datum underlying, via [[Sullivan model|Sullivan's theorem]], a [[cocycle]] in unstable [[J-homomorphism|J-]] [[twisted Cohomotopy]] in degree 4 ([[schreiber:Hypothesis H]]).

## For the electric $G_7$-flux

In the presence of non-vanishing [[C-field]] [[flux]] $G_4$, the electric [[flux density]] of [[M2-branes]] is not $G_7 \coloneqq \star G_4$ alone, but receives corrections, first due to the quadratic [[C-field]] self-interaction in [[D=11 supergravity]], but then also due to the [[shifted C-field flux quantization]] expected in [[M-theory]]:

\linebreak

**The [[11d supergravity]] literature** states the corrected 7-flux to be the following combination, also known as the _[[Page charge]]_ (due to [Page 83 (8)](M2-brane#Page83), [Duff-Stelle 91 (43)](M2-brane#DuffStelle91), reviewed e.g. in [BLMP 13, p. 21](M2-brane#BaggerLambertMukhiPapageorgakis13)):



\[
  \label{FirstCorrectionToG7}
  \widetilde G'_7 
  \;\coloneqq\;
  G_7 + \tfrac{1}{2} C_3 \wedge G_4
  \,,
\]

where the second term subtracts the electric flux induced by the self-intersection of the [[field]], and also ensures that the full expression is a [[closed differential form]] if the naive [[11d supergravity]] [[equations of motion]] hold:

$$
  d \widetilde G_7
  \;=\;
  0
  \,.
$$

But in fact (eq:FirstCorrectionToG7) does not quite make general sense, for two reasons:

1. In general $G_4 = 0$ is not an admissible condition and is not the actual vanshing of the [[C-field]], due to the [[shifted C-field flux quantization]].

1. Even if $G_4$ happens to be intregrally quantizaed (if $\tfrac{1}{4}p_1$ is integral) the appearance of a globally defined [[C-field]] potential $C_3$ in (eq:FirstCorrectionToG7),means that the total [[flux]] actually does vanish after all.

\linebreak

**Charge-quantized $\widetilde G_7$-flux with [[shifted C-field flux quantization]]** ([FSS 19b, Prop. 4.3](#FSS19b), [FSS 19c, Section 4](#FSS19c))

Both of these issues are solved if the [[C-field]] is taken to be [[charge quantization|charge quantized]] in [[J-homomorphism|J-]][[twisted Cohomotopy]] ([[schreiber:Hypothesis H]]). This gives the corrected formula 

\[
  \label{FullCorrectionToG7}
  \widetilde G_7 
  \;\coloneqq\;
  h^\ast G_7 + \tfrac{1}{2} H_3 \wedge h^\ast \widetilde G_4
\]

1. the expression lives on the [[homotopy pullback]] of the [[Sp(2)]]-[[parametrized homotopy theory|parametrized]] [[quaternionic Hopf fibration]] 

   $$
     h \coloneqq h_{\mathbb{H}}\sslash Sp(2)
   $$ 

   to [[spacetime]], along the [[twisted Cohomotopy]]-[[cocycle]] that represents the [[C-field]] under [[schreiber:Hypothesis H]];

1. $\widetilde G_4 \coloneqq h^\ast G_4 + \tfrac{1}{4}h^\ast p_1(\nabla)$ is the integral [[shifted C-field flux quantization|shifted C-field]] pulled back to that 3-[[spherical fibration]] over spacetime;

1. $d H_3 = h^\ast G_4 - \tfrac{1}{4}h^\ast p_1(\nabla)$ trivializes not the C-field itself, but its pullback, and not absolutely but relative to the background charge implied by [[shifted C-field flux quantization]].

With the corrected 7-flux in [[twisted Cohomotopy]] it becomes true that 

1. the integral of $G_7$ around the [[7-sphere]] linking a [[black brane|black]] [[M2-brane]] is always [[integer]] ([FSS 19c, Theorem 4.6](#FSS19c));

1. this integer satisfies the [[C-field tadpole cancellation condition]] ([FSS 19b, Section 4.6](#FSS19b)).
