## Idea

The analogue of the [[characteristic of a ring]], but for [[rigs]]. Unlike the characteristic of a [[ring]], the characteristic of a rig is given by two natural numbers, one characterizing the subrigs of $\mathbb{N}$ and a second characterizing the quotient rigs of $\mathbb{N}$, due to the possible failure of [[cancellative monoid|cancellativity]] for addition of a [[rig]].  

## Definition

Every quotient rig of $\mathbb{N}$ is equivalent to a quotient rig $\mathbb{N}/(x + m \sim x + m + n)$ for some natural number $m \geq 0$ and $n \geq 1$ ([Rogers 2024](#Rogers24)). Thus, let $\mathbb{N}_{m, n}$ denote the quotient [[rig]] $\mathbb{N}/(x + m \simeq x + m + n)$. 

\begin{definition}
A rig $R$ has **characteristic** $(m, n)$ for $m \geq 0$ and $n \geq 1$ if the subrig of $R$ generated by $1$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{N}_{m, n}$, and a rig $R$ has characteristic $(\infty,0)$ or $(0, 0)$ if the subrig of $R$ generated by $1$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{N}$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
The notion $(0, 0)$ for the characteristic of rigs whose subrig generated by $1$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{N}$ generalises to that of [[rings]]: The characteristic of a ring is the rig characteristic $(0, n)$: characteristic zero rings are precisely those whose subrig generated by $1$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{N}$. As a result, we shall use the convention $(0, 0)$ in this article rather than the $(\infty,0)$ convention used in the [Rogers 2024](#Rogers24). 
\end{remark}

## Properties

Every [[ring]] with characteristic $n$ has, as a rig, a characteristic of $(0, n)$. Moreover, every rig with characteristic $(0, n)$ for positive $n$ is in fact a ring. However, there still exist rigs which are not rings with characteristic $(0, 0)$, such as the [[natural numbers]] $\mathbb{N}$. 

More generally, every rig whose addition is a [[cancellative monoid]] has characteristic $(0, n)$.
