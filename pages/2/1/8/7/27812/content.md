## Idea

The analogue of the [[characteristic of a ring]], but for [[rigs]]. 

Due to the possible failure of [[cancellative monoid|cancellativity]] for addition of a [[rig]], it is insufficient to only consider the quotient rigs of $\mathbb{N}$ for the subrig generated by $1$, which is needed to characterize the additive $\mathbb{N}$-action on the rig for the definition of a characteristic. 

Thus, unlike the characteristic of a [[ring]], the characteristic of a rig is given by two natural numbers, one characterizing the subrigs of $\mathbb{N}$ and a second characterizing the quotient rigs of $\mathbb{N}$. 

## Terminology

In this article and in the literature on rig theory, this notion is just called a *characteristic* of a rig. However, to distinguish this notion of characteristic from the usual definition of a *[[characteristic]]* of a [[ring]], perhaps the term *rig characteristic* can be used for this notion of characteristic for rings. 

## Definition

Every [[rig]] is an $\mathbb{N}$-[[module]], so has a [[action]] $(n, x) \mapsto n x$ for natural number $n$ and element $x$.

\begin{definition}
A rig $R$ has **characteristic** $(m, n)$ for $m \geq 0$ and $n \geq 1$ if $m$ and $n$ are the smallest natural numbers such that for all elements $x$, $m x = (m + n) x$ . A rig $R$ has **rig characteristic** $(\infty,0)$ if there does not exist any positive natural number $n$ such that $m x = (m + n) x$. 
\end{definition}

There is another definition of a characteristic of a rig involving maps out of quotient rigs of $\mathbb{N}$. 

Every quotient rig of $\mathbb{N}$ is equivalent to a quotient rig $\mathbb{N}/(x + m \sim x + m + n)$ for some natural number $m \geq 0$ and $n \geq 1$ ([Rogers 2024](#Rogers24)). Thus, let $\mathbb{N}_{m, n}$ denote the quotient [[rig]] $\mathbb{N}/(x + m \simeq x + m + n)$. 

\begin{definition}
A rig $R$ has **characteristic** $(m, n)$ for $m \geq 0$ and $n \geq 1$ if the subrig of $R$ generated by $1$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{N}_{m, n}$, and a rig $R$ has **characteristic** $(\infty,0)$ if the subrig of $R$ generated by $1$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{N}$. 
\end{definition}

## Properties

Every [[ring]] with [[positive characteristic]] $n$ has, as a rig, a rig characteristic of $(0, n)$. Moreover, every rig with rig characteristic $(0, n)$ is in fact a ring with [[positive characteristic]] $n$. 

Similarly, every ring with [[characteristic zero]] has rig characteristic $(\infty,0)$ as a rig. However, there still exist rigs which are not rings with [[characteristic zero]], such as the [[natural numbers]] $\mathbb{N}$. 

More generally, every rig whose addition is a [[cancellative monoid]] has rig characteristic $(0, n)$ or rig characteristic $(\infty,0)$.
