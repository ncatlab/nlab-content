## Definition

For $X$ a [[smooth manifold]], $E \to X$ a [[vector bundle]] and $D : \Gamma(E) \to \Gamma(E)$ a [[linear differential operator]] on [[sections]] of $E$, its **symbol** is the bundle morphism

$$
   \sigma(D) \;:\; T^* X \otimes_X E \to E
$$

from the [[tensor product of vector bundles]] with the [[cotangent bundle]] which is given at any point $x \in X$ on a [[cotangent vector]] of the form $(\mathbf{d}f)_x \in \Gamma(T^* X)_x$ by

$$
  \sigma(D)_x \;\colon\; \mathbf{d}f_x \mapsto [D,f]_x
  \,,
$$

where in the [[commutator]] on the right we regard multiplication by $f$ as an [[endomorphism]] of $\Gamma(E)$.

{#InKTheory} The symbol of an [[elliptic differential operator]]  may naturally be thought of as an element in the [[topological K-theory]] of $T^\ast X$ (see [Freed 1987](#Freed87), [p. 13](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/FreedGeometryOfDiracOperators.pdf#page=13)).

Generally, the symbol of a possibly non-linear [[differential operator]] is similarly the map on the [[cotangent bundle]] given by "replacing [[partial derivatives]] by [[covectors]]" in the definition of the differential operator. In this case the [[principal symbol]] is the highest degree [[homogeneous function|homogeneous]] component of the symbol. Many authors say total symbol for symbol in the sense of this entry and symbol for a principal symbol.

###### Definition
**([[symbol map]])**

For $X = \mathbb{R}^n$ a [[Cartesian space]] and $D$ the [[Dirac operator]] of the [[flat connection]], the symbol of $D$ reproduces the [[symbol map]] between [[differential forms]] and [[Clifford algebra]] elements.

###### Example
**([[bicharacteristic flow]])**

For $E$ a [[real vector bundle|real]] [[trivial line bundle]] then the principal symbol is equivalently just a real-valued [[smooth function]] on the [[cotangent bundle]]. Since any cotangent bundle is canonically a [[symplectic manifold]], in this case the symbol may be regarded as a [[Hamiltonian]] funtion. The corresponding [[Hamiltonian flow]] is called the _[[bicharacteristic flow]]_ of the given differential operator.
