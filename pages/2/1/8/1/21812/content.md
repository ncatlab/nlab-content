\section{Idea}

When sending a [[digital signal]], long sequences of 0s or 1s in the original bit sequence can lead to a [[signal]] which in practise is difficult to decode when received. Thus a first step in the process of creating a [[waveform]] from a sequence of bits typically involves _scrambling_ the bit sequence: replacing the original bit sequence in a reversible way by one with a roughly equal number of 0s and 1s, so that whether a particular bit after scrambling is 0 or 1 is pseudo-random.
