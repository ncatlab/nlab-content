|1945| |[[Jean Leray]]| |Starts [[sheaf theory]]: A [[sheaf]] on a [[topological space]] $X$ is a [[functor]] reminding one of a function defined locally on $X$ and taking values in [[set]]s, abelian [[group]]s, commutative [[ring]]s, [[module]]s or generally in any [[category]] $C$. In fact [[Alexander Grothendieck]] later made a [[dictionary between sheaves and functions]]. Another interpretation of sheaves is as continuously [[variable set]]s (a generalization of [[abstract set]]s). Its purpose is to provide a unified approach to connect local and global properties of [[topological space]]s and to classify the obstructions for passing from local objects to global objects on a topological space by pasting together the local pieces.

|1958| |[[Alexander Grothendieck]]| |starts new foundation of [[algebraic geometry]] by generalizing varieties and other spaces in algebraic geometry to [[schemes]] which have the structure of a category with open subsets as objects and restrictions as morphisms. Schemes form a category that is a [[Grothendieck topos]], and to a scheme and even a stack one may associate a Zariski topos, an &#233;tale topos, a fppf topos, a fpqc topos, a Nisnevich topos, a flat topos, ... depending on the topology imposed on the scheme. The whole of algebraic geometry was categorized with time|
|1958| |[[Roger Godement]]| |[[monad]]s in category theory (which he called standard constructions).

|1963| |[[William Lawvere]]| |Founds [[categorical logic]], discovers [[internal logic]]s of categories and recognizes their importance and introduces [[Lawvere theory|Lawvere theories]]. Essentially categorical logic is a lift of different logics to being internal logics of categories. Each kind of category with extra structure ([[doctrine]]) corresponds to a system of logic with its own inference rules. A Lawvere theory is an [[algebraic theory]] as a category with finite products and possessing a "generic algebra" (such as a generic group). The structures described by a Lawvere theory are models of the Lawvere theory|
|1963| |[[Jean-Louis Verdier]]| |after the advice of Grothendieck, defined [[triangulated category|triangulated categories]] and [[triangulated functor]]s including the main examples: [[derived category|derived categories]]. Studied [[derived functor]]s in the triangualted setup|

|1963| |[[Charles Ehresmann]]| |[[internal category]] theory: internalization of categories in a category $V$ with pullbacks replacing the category $Set$ (same for classes instead of sets) by $V$ in the definition of a category. Internalization is a way to rise the [[higher category theory|categorical dimension]]|
|1963| |[[Charles Ehresmann]]| |[[multiple category|multiple categories]] and [[multiple functor|multiple functors]]|
|1963| |[[Saunders Mac Lane]]| |[[monoidal categories]] also called tensor categories: $2$-categories with one object made by a [[delooping|relabelling trick]] into categories with a [[tensor product]] of objects that is secretly the composition of morphisms in the $2$-category. There are several objects in a monoidal category since the relabelling trick makes $2$-morphisms of the $2$-category into morphisms, morphisms of the $2$-category into objects and forgets about the single object. In general a higher relabelling trick works for $n$-[[n-category|categories]] with one object to make general monoidal categories. The most common examples include: [[ribbon category|ribbon categories]], [[braided monoidal category|braided tensor categories]], [[spherical category|spherical categories]], [[compact closed category|compact closed categories]], [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric tensor categories]], [[modular category|modular categories]], [[autonomous category|autonomous categories]], [[category with duals|categories with duality]]|

|1964| |[[Alexander Grothendieck]]| |topologizes categories axiomatically by imposing a [[Grothendieck topology]] on categories which are then called [[sites]]. The purpose of sites is to define coverings on them so sheaves over sites can be defined. The other "spaces" one can define sheaves for except topological spaces are locales|
|1964| |[[Alexander Grothendieck]]| |$l$-[[adic cohomology]]|
|1964| |[[Alexander Grothendieck]]| |proves the [[Weil conjectures]] except the analogue of the Riemann hypothesis|
|1964| |[[Alexander Grothendieck]]| |[[six operations]] formalism in [[homological algebra]]; $R f_*$, $f^{-1}$, $R f_!$, $f_!$, $\otimes^L$, $R Hom$, and proof of its closedness|
|1964| |[[Alexander Grothendieck]] | |introduced in a letter to [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] conjectural [[motive]]s to express the idea that there is a single universal cohomology theory underlying the various cohomology theories for algebraic varieties. According to Grothendieck\'s memoirs this idea was born in 1958. According to Grothendieck\'s philosophy there should be a universal cohomology functor attaching a [[pure motive]] $h(X)$ to each smooth projective variety $X$. When $X$ is not smooth or projective, $h(X)$ must be replaced by a more general [[mixed motive]] which has a weight filtration whose quotients are pure motives. The [[Mot|category of motives]] (the categorical framework for the universal cohomology theory) may be used as an abstract substitute for singular cohomology (and rational cohomology) to compare, relate and unite "motivated" properties and parallel phenomena of the various cohomology theories and to detect topological structure of algebraic varieties. The categories of pure motives and of mixed motives are abelian tensor categories and the category of pure motives is also a [[Tannakian category]]. Categories of motives are made by replacing the category of varieties by a category with the same objects but whose morphisms are [[correspondence]]s, modulo a suitable equivalence relation. Different [[equivalence relation|equivalences]] give different theories. [[rational equivalence|Rational equivalence]] gives the category of [[Chow motive]]s with [[Chow group]]s as morphisms which are in some sense universal. Every geometric cohomology theory is a functor on the category of motives. Each induced functor $\rho$ from motives modulo numerical equivalence to graded $\mathbf{Q}$-vector spaces is called a [[realization]] of the category of motives, the inverse functors are called [[improvement]]s. Mixed motives explain phenomena in as diverse areas as: Hodge theory, algebraic $K$-theory, polylogarithms, regulator maps, automorphic forms, $L$-functions, $l$-adic representations, trigonometric sums, homotopy of algebraic varieties, algebraic cycles, and moduli spaces and thus has the potential of enriching each area and of unifying them all|

|1965| |[[Max Kelly]]| |[[differential graded category|dg-categories]]|
|1965| |[[Max Kelly]]--[[Samuel Eilenberg]]| |[[enriched category theory]]: Categories $C$ enriched over a category $V$ are categories with [[hom-object|Hom-sets]] $Hom_C$ not just a set or class but with the structure of objects in the category $V$. Enrichment over $V$ is a way to raise the [[higher category theory|categorical dimension]]|

|1967| |[[Daniel Quillen]]| |[[Quillen model category|Quillen model categories]] and [[Quillen model functor]]s: A framework for doing homotopy theory in an axiomatic way in categories and an abstraction of [[homotopy category|homotopy categories]] in such a way that $h C = C[W^{-1}]$ where $W^{-1}$ consists of the inverted [[weak equivalence]]s of the Quillen model category $C$. Quillen model categories are homotopically complete and cocomplete, and come with a built-in [[Eckmann?Hilton duality]]|
|1967| |[[Daniel Quillen]]| |[[homotopical algebra]] (published as a book and also sometimes called noncommutative homological algebra): introduces [[model category|model categories]] in terms of fibrations, cofibrations and weak equivalences and studies main examples, [[Quillen axioms]] for homotopy theory in [[model category|model categories]]|

|1968| |[[Alexander Grothendieck]]| |[[crystalline cohomology]]: A $p$-[[adic cohomology]] theory in characteristic $p$ invented to fill the gap left by [[etale cohomology]] which is deficient in using mod $p$ coefficients for this case. It is sometimes referred to by Grothendieck as the yoga of de Rham coefficients and Hodge coefficients since crystalline cohomology of a variety $X$ in characteristic $p$ is like [[de Rham cohomology]] mod $p$ of $X$ and there is an isomorphism between de Rham cohomology groups and Hodge cohomology groups of harmonic forms|

If the lattice possess enough points it is a topological space. Locales are the main objects of [[pointless topology]], the dual objects being [[frame|frames]].

|1973| |Chris Reedy| |[[Reedy category|Reedy categories]]: Categories of "shapes" that can be used to do homotopy theory. A Reedy category is a category R equipped with a structure enabling the inductive construction of diagrams and natural transformations of shape R. The most important consequence of a Reedy structure on R is the existence of a model structure on the [[functor category]] M<sup>R</sup> whenever M is a [[model category]]. Another advantage of the Reedy structure is that its cofibrations, fibrations and factorizations are explicit. In a Reedy category there is a notion of an injective and a surjective morphism such that any morphism can be factored uniquely as a surjection followed by an injection. Examples are the ordinal &#945; considered as a [[poset]] and hence a category. The opposite R&#176; of a Reedy category R is a Reedy category. The [[simplex category]] &#916; and more generally for any [[simplicial set]] X its category of simplices &#916;/X is a Reedy category. The model structure on M<sup>&#916;</sup> for a model category M is described in an unpublished manuscript by Chris Reedy|

In the case when A = QCoh(X) for X a scheme the pair (Spec(A),O<sub>A</sub>) is naturally isomorphic to the scheme (X<sup>Zar</sup>,O<sub>X</sub>) using the equivalence of categories QCoh(Spec(R))=Mod<sub>R</sub>. More generally abelian categories or triangulated categories or dg-categories or A<sub>?</sub>-categories should be regarded as categories of quasicoherent sheaves (or complexes of sheaves) on noncommutative schemes. This is a starting point in [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]]. It means that one can think of the category A itself as a space. Since A is abelian it allows to naturally do [[homological algebra]] on noncommutative schemes and hence [[sheaf cohomology]].|

In a higher topos not only mathematics can be done but also "n-geometry", which is [[higher homotopy theory]]. The [[topos hypothesis]] is that the (n+1)-category nCat is a Grothendieck (n+1)-topos.

Rafael: Zoran &#352;koda, you have to be more precise.
Koszul resolutions of what?
Notion of exactness for what?

Zoran: he does one VERY complex calculation in which he masterly uses constructions involving organizational principles as above, without modern words and general definitions. The article is reproduced in the book Gelfand, Kapranov, Zelevinsky which is about the current state of the art in similar computations and which can explain more.

_Rafael Borowiecki_: Me and _Zoran &#352;koda_ are arguing if to keep this first entry in the timeline. See [[latest changes|latest changes]] 2009-09-04 for the start of the discussion (that could be moved here). I am waiting to hear what others think about it.

_Rafael_: After thinking a bit more about it, it comes down to the same as i wrote above. Koszul resolution of whitch algebra? Is it a particular kind of Koszul algebra for starter? Otherwise the explanation is no real main theorem of the paper. It is not closed. I suppose the exactness would be for the Koszul resolution.

Then, this theorem is by far the most specialized result in the timeline. So i see it as the least important result in the timeline. If it would at least be a theory of determinants of complexes or inspired this theory, it would be worth mentioning, but it's not. There are too many particular cases and results to start to include them, the idea was at least to include the most important events in category theory and the related disciplines.

_Zoran_: I am not talking Koszul algebras of Priddy but the older Koszul resolutions in the subject of [[commutative algebra]]. Of course, Koszul pair of the symmetric vs. exterior algebra is behind the classical Koszul resolutions; but the resolutions are typically, like in Cayley's work, resolutions of modules of finite type over reduced f.g. commutative algebras. Thus take any projective variety and a coherent sheaf on it and you are in the setup of this paper. The paper starts with a notion of resolution in about this setup, then develops Koszul resolutions and calculations with determinants which express the bases of the modules which appear in the resolution. This is very general. Gel'fand, Kapranov, Zelevinsky in their book dedicate chapter 2 (and 3.4) to "Cayley method" and say this about the paper: "The method goes back to the remarkable paper by Cayley [Ca4] on elimination theory, in which the foundations were laid for what is now called homological algebra." But what happened with your too shy question/suggestion to include also Galois ? By the way what does it mean "categorical quantization" in 1978 entry ?
Never heard.

Rafael: Zoran &#352;koda, Which is the other paper?
You have to be more precise with the names.
Joseph Bernstein? Israel Gel'fand? Gel'fand who?
Lets stick to one year per event.

Zoran: No, Beilinson's work has been published in two papers in separate years; one of the two is written as an accompanying paper to BGG paper (BGG is the abbreviation to search for, BGG resolutions etc; B is Joseph Bernstein of course, G and G are both Gelfands, father and son, Israel Moiseevich and Sergej Israelovich). The references and the work of Beilinson cited and build upon in reference cited in nlab link within above 1990 entry on Bondal-Kapranov. I think that 1980 is too late for attribution to Mebkhout's thesis, which is earlier than Kashiwara's work by 1-2 years. Voevodsky's work is largely built in mid 1990-s (with ideas of his approach starting in late 1980s). 1995 attributes the notion of categorification to Crane; Toen gave a talk that Ehresmann invented and systematically used the notion, but I am not sure if he used the WORD or only the philosophy of it, somebody should check that with French school. One of the major missing points of the list above is that seminal works of Duskin are completely not mentioned, including his pioneering works on higher groupoids and higher torsors in simplicial language; similarly contributions of say Marta Bunge, Dedecker, Getzler... But I am not enthusiastic about pinning history to something as untrue as trying to fit into single years, and would much  rather instead more work on other nlab entries. 

_Toby_:  What is the purpose of the timeline?  If it\'s to know when things were done, not so much when they were published, then we should generally put entries in the earliest appropriate date; I think that this is what John would like to get out of this article.  But if we want to note the publishing date of every paper, then many ideas will be spread out over many dates.  Even if we want to know when ideas came, there may still be a range of dates from first glimmer to final working out.

$4$ Cartan Seminaire writing up sheaf theory in 1948 for the first time

+--{.query}
Zoran: this is [CartanSem 1948-1949](http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/feuilleter?id=SHC_1948-1949__1_). I see no sheaf theory explicitly introduced. 

_Rafael_: I don't see anything there, the page is missing. In this case i have a [reference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheaf_theory) i trusted. Where this author have his reference i have no idea.

Zoran: oops one character too long, try [again](http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/feuilleter?id=SHC_1948-1949__1_)

_Rafael_: Alas, don't forget i don't know french. When i read the entry i interpret it as it was written on a blackboard. But something as important as this should be in the proceedings. I also know that some concepts such as the Schwartzian derivative are well hidden in their first appearance. I am open to remove entries, so if you know you are right remove it.

Zoran: In fact I believe you are right, that Cartan seminars had sheaves in 1948; thsi is what I recall from my earlier readings, but it is not in the writeup of the seminars as it stands; I do not know what is the reference. Maybe we should look in Serre's FAC paper where he should have quoted earlier papers on sheaf theory.

Zoran: Here is the key! The 1948/9 acad year volume of Cartan seminar has 11 exposes, as on numdam. Weibel in his historical survey says that exposes 12-17 in mimeographed version had sheaf theory and that those exposes were abandoned, hence not published for real later and that Cartan again in 1950/51 a reworked version is published as exposes 14-20 (the latter are at numdam). Now timeline has 3 years as 3 contributions of Cartan 1948, 1950, 1951; at least the latter two for one academic year of the same volume of publications is not sensitive.

###Concerning an update from Wikipedia###

_Rafael_: I have been writing on a new version of this timeline in wikipedia and i can handle the migration to nLab now. Except maby for some formulas. But how do i handle to update most of 1500 links!?

###Concerning the Desire for References###

Rafael: John, if you need references a priority is needed for which references to include first.

[[John Baez|John]]: I would really like to know who first defined (strict) 2-categories, and in precisely what book or paper!  I have a fairly large number of references already, [here](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/history.pdf) and in some [other expository papers](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/rosetta.pdf).  If I had more time I would transfer a lot of these references to the $n$Lab --- though I see on the $n$Forum that Andrew Stacey wants to improve our facilities for dealing with references, and maybe I should wait for that.   

In general, people will consult this timeline if they want to know when something was done, but such people often also want to know _where_ it was done.  And, no scholar worth his salt would accept a date without any way to check whether it's correct.

Rafael:
The first reference i found was your "An introduction to n-categories" that states that strict 2-categories where first defined by C. Ehresmann in 1965 and by 1962 (page 12). I must have reasoned that since you mention two years and also speak about strict n-categories that were defined in 1965 you must mean that strict 2-categories were defined in 1962, and adopted it in the timeline.

A further search found "A 2-categories companion" - Stephen Lack, where he states that C. Ehresmann defined strict 2-categories in reference 13 which is the 1965 "Categories et structures". I have changed the year in the timeline.

Then i think you are missing one of the big points with the timeline: to find things (mostly explanations) that are hard to find elsewhere. This might not seem hard to experts in category theory but for the rest "nonexperts" it is. I know how much time i have spend on it. For instance first i could not find any definition of a $A_\infty$-category for a long time. Then i found 9 definitions (excluding nLab)! Only 2 of them completely agreed! I had to actually make a table with all the differences to compare them. I think i got it right.


###Concerning the Desire for 'Milestones'###

[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: I am very fond of the aim of this entry. I suggest, though (and might start implementing that when I find time), that we try to split, for the reader's convenience, a list of true generally accepted _milestone_ constributions that indicate the big stepts forward, from a a list that rather aims to give a somewhat complete list of all contributions of some relevance.

Rafael: Why not splitting?  The table will grow larger and a split will be necessary soon anyway. I just hope everyone agrees what the milestones are.

: [[John Baez|John]] We won't agree on the milestones, but we can have fun arguing about it.  I think this page here should include _lots_ of developments, with just a little text about each one, so people can find out when things happened.  Another entry, called something like "Milestones in Category Theory and Related Mathematics", could be more selective.  We should not remove information from this big list, but we can copy "milestones" to a shorter list.

: When writing papers it's often nice to refer to the article or book where a concept was first developed.  So, I want to have this information in the $n$Lab eventually.  In particular, if we claim that multiple categories were invented in 1963 by Ehresmann, we should have a reference somewhere to back up this claim.  But maybe that reference should appear in the (not-yet-existent) page on multiple categories.  That will prevent this page from becoming unnecessarily long.

[[David Corfield|David]]: I can see the milestone list being contentious. Anyway far more important to improve this timeline first. We could do with some experts looking it over. I'm sure most would include the effective topos concept much sooner than the quantum topos. I've transported out some of the material for a couple of lengthy entries, e.g., AST. It looks better to have entries of comparable length and with no breaks in the table, e.g., to define cosmoses.

[[John Baez|John]]: I've deleted the entry on 'quantum topos', since in fact most experts are very doubtful that a correct definition has been found for this notion, and they're even uncertain such a notion deserves to exist. Let's stick to concepts that are fairly widely considered to be fruitful.

:Rafael:
I don't mind deleting it. But i am also curious what is wrong with the definition

[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: that sounds good. Maybe I was thinking that "timeline of category theory" sounds like it shouldn't contain just every little bit. So maybe if and when we split, is there any majority for keeping this title here for the _short_ list and another title for the long list, maybe _literature list of category theory_ or the like?

[[John Baez|John]]:  Right now I don't feel this timeline contains too much minor stuff.  It mostly just contains stuff that's very important to the history of categories and related math.   I might take out a few things, but mostly I'd feel the need to add things to get a reasonably full timeline.

I might shorten some of the entries though: the longer ones seem to be on topics that Rafael knows more about, so their length doesn't seem proportional to their importance.  I also don't think there need to be 5 entries devoted to my first paper with Jim Dolan!

Someday someone (maybe Andrew Stacey) will create an easy way for us to dump bibliographical information into the $n$Lab, and then maybe we can grow an enormous 'literature list' without doing too much work.  

Rafael: I actually had the idea to collect John's first paper in a separate entry. If i don't find a way to do line breaks a separate page is needed for it. The same goes for pursuing stacks! I am very interesting to hear what you have in mind to add! I would edit more (especially clean up links and style in the timeline) but nLab is too slow for me to edit efficiently.

_Toby_:  See [[Bibliography]] for the beginnings of a literature list.

Jim Stasheff: Is bibtex incompatible with this wiki?
The nice lines separating entries on screen do not print.
It would be better (but too late?) if the person's name was aligned with the first line of the Event.

_Toby_:  Yet another reason for formatting this all as a list, I think.
