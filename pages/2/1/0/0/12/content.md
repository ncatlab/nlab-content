This is a test to migrate the timeline of category theory and related mathematics from Wikipedia to nLab.

Reason: No one really contributes to it at wikipedia

If i had started a little later when nLab existed i would write in nLab from the start.

|1890| |[[David Hilbert]]| |[[resolution of modules|Resolution]] and free resolution of modules|
|1890| |[[David Hilbert]]| |[[Hilbert syzygy theorem]]|
|1893| |[[David Hilbert]]| |[[nullstellensatz|Fundamental theorem of algebraic geometry]] also called Hilbert Nullstellensatz. It was later reformulated to: the category of [[affine variety|affine varieties]] over a field $k$ is equivalent to the [[opposite category|dual]] of the category of reduced finitely generated (commutative) $k$-[[associative unital algebra|algebras]]|
