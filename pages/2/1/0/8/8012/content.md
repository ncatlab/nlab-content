## Idea 

A **Seifert surface** (named after [[Herbert Seifert]]) is an [[orientable]] [[surface]] whose [[boundary]] is a given [[knot]] or [[link]]. This concept may be extended to higher [[dimensions]] where a [[compact]] oriented $(n+1)$-manifold forms the boundary of a higher-dimensional link, a disconnected union of $m$ copies of the $n$-sphere as a submanifold of the $(n+2)$-sphere.

## Related concepts

* [[knot]]

* [[Alexander polynomial]]

Beware that there is also the *un-related* concept of:

* [[Seifert-fibered manifolds]]
