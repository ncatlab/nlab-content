An **inverse** of a [[morphism]] $f : X \to Y$ in a [[category]] is another morphism $f^{-1} : Y \to X$ which is both a left-inverse (a [[retraction]]) as well as a right-inverse (a [[section]]) of $f$, in that 
$$
  f \circ f^{-1} : Y \to X \to Y 
$$
equals the [[identity]] on $Y$ and
$$
  f^{-1} \circ f : X \to Y \to X 
$$
equals the [[identity]] on $X$.

#Remarks#

* A morphism which has an inverse is called an [[isomorphism]].

* The inverse $f^{-1}$ is unique if it exists.

* The inverse of an inverse morphism is the original morphism, $(f^{-1})^{-1} = f$.

* A category in which all morphisms have inverses is called a [[groupoid]].
