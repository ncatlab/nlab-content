## Idea

In [[Euclidean field theory]], an alternative to regarding [[propagators]]/[[correlators]] as [[distributions of several variables]] with [[singularities]] on the [[fat diagonal]], is to [[pullback of distributions|pull-back]] these distributions to [[smooth functions]]/[[differential forms]] on ([[Fulton-MacPherson compactifications]] of) [[configuration spaces of points]] and regard them in this incarnation, in particular discuss their [[renormalization]] from this perspective.

Analogous to the perspective of [[wavefront sets]] for distributions, this perspective amounts to recording around each potentially singular point an [[n-sphere|(d-1)-sphere]] worth of extra [[direction of a vector|directional]] information carried by the [[correlator]]/[[Feynman amplitude]] in the vicinity of the point.

This approach goes back to [Axelrod-Singer 93](#AxelrodSinger93) in the discussion of [[perturbative quantum field theory|perturbative]] [[quantization of Chern-Simons theory]]. Here the [[graph complex]] of [Kontsevich 94](#Kontsevich94) (full details due to [Lambrechts-Volić 14](#LambrechtsVolic14)) shows that the [[de Rham algebra]] of the [[configuration space of points]] is actuall [[quasi-isomorphism|quais-isomorphic]] to all possible [[Feynman amplitudes]] for free [[Chern-Simons theory|Chern-Simons]]/[[AKSZ theory]].

A general and systematic discussion of [[perturbative quantum field theory]] and its [[renormalization]] from this perspective is offered in [Berghoff 14a](#Berghoff14a), [Berghoff 14b](#Berghoff14b) (albeit presently only for [[Euclidean quantum field theory]], not for [[relativistic quantum field theory]]).

## Examples

### Higher Chern-Simons theory


This approach to [[pQFT]] was originally considered specifically for the [[Chern-Simons propagator]] in  [[quantization of 3d Chern-Simons theory]] in [Axelrod-Singer 93](#AxelrodSinger93), see also [Bott-Cattaneo 97, Remark 3.6](#BottCattaneo97) and [Cattaneo-Mnev 10, Remark 11](#CattaneoMnev10). The analysis applies verbatim to [[higher Chern-Simons theory]] such as notably the [[AKSZ sigma-models]], too, since the [[Feynman propagator]]  depends only on the [[free field theory]]-[[equations of motion]], which is $d A = 0$ in all these cases. 

Here the [[Chern-Simons propagator]] regarded as a non-singular [[differential form]] on the [[Fulton-MacPherson compactification|compactification]] of the [[configuration space of points]] serves to exhibit its [[Feynman amplitudes]] as providing [[graph complex]]-models for the [[de Rham cohomology]] of these [[Fulton-MacPherson compactification|compactified]] [[configuration spaces of points]], a point due to [Kontsevich 94](#Kontsevich94), [Kontsevich 93, 5](#Kontsevich93):
