## Idea

### General

A _certification_ or _formal verification_ of a computer program is a formalized guarantee -- a [[proof]] -- that the program has given specified properties.  For instance, it could be guaranteed to compute a given output based on a given input, or to always terminate, or to not include a certain kind of security hole.

Certifications often take the form of a [[formal proof]] (whence "formal methods" [WLBF09](#WLBF09)) that a program, regarded as a [[term]] of some sort (under _[[programs as proofs]]_), has a specified [[type]].  Thus, [[programming languages]] based on highly expressive [[type theories]] (including [[dependent types]]) are a natural place to do certified programming "natively".  Examples are _[[Coq]]_ and _[[Agda]]_. In this case, the program is written at the same time as a proof of its certification.  One often then wants to "extract" the executable code or "ignore" the proof part of the terms when actually running the code, for performance reasons; Coq and Agda include mechanisms designed for this.

It is also possible to write a program in some less strongly typed language and provide an "external" certification for it, rather than one built into the program itself.  Computer proof assistants like [[Coq]] and [[Agda]] are also used for this, using a formal representation of some other programming language.  There are also other program analysis tools which can produce automated proofs of certain aspects of a computer program, such as safety and termination (although of course a *complete* solution to termination-checking is impossible, being the [[halting problem]]).

### Via homotopy type theory

From [Ghani et al. 15](#GhaniEtAl15):

> The cost of software failure is truly staggering. Well known individual cases include the Mars Climate Orbiter failure (&#163;80 million), Ariane Rocket disaster (&#163;350 million), Pentium Chip Division failure (&#163;300 million), and more recently the heartbleed bug (est. &#163;400 million). There are many, many more examples. Even worse,  failures such as one in the Patriot Missile System and another  in the Therac-25 radiation system have cost lives. More generally, a  2008 study by the US government estimated that faulty software costs the US economy &#163;100 billion annually. 

> There are many successful approaches to software verification (testing, model checking etc). One approach is to find mathematical [[proofs]] that guarantees of software correctness. However, the complexity of modern software means that hand-written mathematical proofs can be untrustworthy and this has led to a growing desire for computer-checked proofs of software correctness.  Programming languages and interactive proof systems like [[Coq]], [[Agda]], [[NuPRL]] and Idris have been developed based on a formal system called [[Martin-Löf type theory]]. In these systems, we can not only write programs, but we can also express properties of programs using [[types]], and write programs to express proofs that our programs are correct.

> In this way, both large mathematical [[theorems]] such as the [[four color theorem|Four Colour Theorem]], and large software systems such as the CompCert C compiler have been formally verified. However, in such large projects, the issue of scalability arises: how can we use these systems to build large libraries of verified software in an effective way?

> This is related to the problem of reusability and modularity: a component in a software system should be replaceable by another which behaves the same way even though it may be constructed in a completely different way. That is, we need an "[[identity type|extensional equality]]" which is computationally well behaved (that is, we want to run programs using this equality). Finding such an equality is a fundamental and difficult problem which has remained unresolved for over 40 years.

> {#WeMightHaveASolution} But now it looks like we might have a solution! Fields medalist [[Vladimir Voevodsky]] has come up with a completely different take on the problem by thinking of equalities as paths such as those which occur in one of the most abstract branches of mathematics, namely [[homotopy theory]], leading to [[homotopy type theory|Homotopy Type Theory]] (HoTT). In HoTT, two objects are completely interchangeable if they behave the same way. However, most presentations of HoTT involve [[axioms]] which lack computational justification and, as a result, we do not have programming languages or verification systems based upon HoTT. The goal of our project is to fix that, thereby develop the first of a new breed of HoTT-based programming languages and verification systems, and develop case studies which demonstrate the power of HoTT to programmers and those interested in formal verification.

### For quantum programming languages
 {#ReferencesForQuantumProgrammingLanguages}


First, on the problem of debugging quantum programs, as maybe first highlighted by [VRSAS 2015](#VRSAS15), [Rand (2018)](#Rand18) and [Ying & Feng (2018)](#YingFeng18):

* {#VRSAS15} [[Benoît Valiron]], [[Neil J. Ross]], [[Peter Selinger]], [[D. Scott Alexander]], [[Jonathan M.

  > &lbrack;p 6:&rbrack; "In quantum computation, the cost of debugging is likely to be quite high. To begin with, observing a quantum system can change its state. A debugger for a quantum program would therefore necessarily give incomplete information about its state when run on actual quantum hardware. The alternative is to use a quantum simulator for debugging. But this is not practical due to the exponential cost of simulating quantum systems. Moreover, it can be expected that the initial quantum computers will be rare and expensive to run and therefore that the cost of runtime errors in quantum code will initially be much higher than in classical computing. This shifts the cost-benefit analysis for quantum programming toward strong compile-time correctness guarantees, as well as formal specification and verification."

  > "The classical parts of a quantum program can be debugged using traditional methods. The quantum parts, however, can not be treated in the same way because of the properties of a QC -- such as superposition, entanglement, and no-cloning -- which are governed by the laws of quantum mechanics. The purpose of debugging a program is to present the user with human readable, i.e., classical, information about the runtime state of the system. Extracting classical information from a quantum state is done using measurement which is usually a non-unitary operation and results in collapse of the state, and hence an unintended behavior of the program."

  > "But to check whether a quantum system satisfies a certain property at a time point, one has to perform a quantum-measurement on the system, which can change the state of the system. This makes studies of the long-term behaviours of quantum systems much harder than that of classical system."

  > "The state spaces of the classical systems that model-checking algorithms can be applied to are usually finite or countably infinite. However, the state spaces of quantum systems are inherently continuous even when they are finite-dimensional. In order to develop algorithms for model-checking quantum systems, we have to exploit some deep mathematical properties of the systems so that it suffices to examine only a finite number of (or at most countably infinitely many) representative elements, e.g. those in an orthonormal basis, of their state spaces."

  > "The characteristic difficulty in creating pure quantum software is mainly due to the inaccessibility to intermediate states, which makes debugging practically impossible. However, the use of formal methods, which apply rigorous mathematical models to ensure error-free software, can overcome this barrier and enable the production of reliable quantum algorithms and applications right out of the box."

It is hard to imagine such an analysis being carried out for more sophisticated quantum protocols. Thus, techniques for automated or semi-automated verification of these protocols will be indispensable."

  > &lbrack;p. iv:&rbrack; "We argue that [[quantum programs]] demand [[proof assistant|machine-checkable proofs]] of correctness. We justify this on the basis of the complexity of programs manipulating [[quantum states]], the expense of running [[quantum programs]], and the inapplicability of traditional debugging techniques to programs whose states cannot be examined."

  > &lbrack;p. 3:&rbrack; "Quantum programs are tremendously difficult to understand and implement, almost guaranteeing that they will have bugs. And traditional approaches to debugging will not help us: We cannot set breakpoints and look at our qubits without [[quantum state collapse|collapsing the quantum state]]. Even techniques like unit tests and random testing will be impossible to run on classical machines and too expensive to run on quantum computers – and failed tests are unlikely to be informative"

Towards that end, we introduce a quantum programming language called [[Qwire]] and embed it inside the [[Coq]] [[proof assistant]]. We give it a [[linear type system]] to ensure that it obeys the laws of [[quantum mechanics]] and a [[denotational semantics]] to prove that programs behave as desired."
