After an early interest in [[formal logic]] (specifically notions of [[computability|computable]] [[surreal numbers]], see [Notices of the AMS vol 43, Number 7](http://www.ams.org/notices/199607/comm-conway.pdf)) Lurie indicated in [his PhD thesis](http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/30144) how the [[moduli stack of elliptic curves]] together with the collection of [[elliptic cohomology]] [[spectra]] associated to each [[elliptic curve]] is naturally understood as a geometric object in a [[homotopy theory|homotopy theoretic]] refinement of [[algebraic geometry]] that has come to be known as [[derived algebraic geometry]]. He then embarked on a monumental work laying out detailed foundations of the subjects necessary for this statement, which is [[homotopy theory]] in its modern incarnation as [[higher category theory]], [[higher geometry]] in terms of [[higher topos theory]] and finally [[higher algebra]] in terms of [[(infinity,1)-operad|higher operads]], all in principle  very much along the lines originally developed by [[Alexander Grothendieck]] and his school for ordinary [[algebraic geometry]], but now considerably further refined to the general context of [[homotopy theory]]. While some developments in these topics had been available before, Lurie's comprehensive work has arguably led these subjects to an era of reinvigorated activity with a variety of further spin-offs. Among these most notable is maybe the formalization and proof of the [[cobordism hypothesis]], which lays [[monoidal (infinity,n)-category|higher monoidal category theoretic]] foundations for ([[extended topological quantum field theory|local, topological]]) [[quantum field theory]]. In 2014 Lurie was awarded a [MacArthur Genius Grant](http://www.macfound.org/fellows/921/) and the Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics.
