##Idea##
**Monadic algebras** are type one [[modal algebras]], in which  the single operator behaves like a closure operation in a topological space, (so these are [[closure algebras]]) and, in addition, elements are closed if and only if they are open.

######Definition######
A **monadic algebra** is a [[closure algebra]], $(\mathbb{B}, m)$, which satisfies:
for all $x$, $x\leq l m x$,
where, as usual, $l$ is a shorthand for $\neg m \neg$.
