_Alg_ is the [[category]] with [[algebra|algebras]] as [[object|objects]] and algebra homomorphisms as [[morphism]]s.

More abstractly, we can think of $Alg$ as the [[category|full subcategory]] of $Cat(Vect)$, [[internal category|internal categories]] in [[Vect]], with algebras as objects.

#Remarks#

Since algebras may be identified with one-object [[category|categories]] [[internalization|internal to]] vector spaces, it is sometimes useful to regard $Alg$ as a strict 2-category, namely as a full sub-2-category of the 2-category $Cat(Vect)$. In this case the 2-morphisms between morphisms of algebras come from "intertwiners": inner endomorphisms of the target algebra.

Precisely analogous statements hold for the category [[Grp]] of groups.

With $Alg$ regarded as a strict 2-category this way there is a canonical 2-functor 

$$
  Alg \hookrightarrow Bimod
$$

to the category [[Bimod]], which sends algebra homomorphisms $f : A \to B$ to the $A$-$B$ bimodule ${}_f B$.  This exhibits $Bimod$ as a [[framed bicategory]] in the sense of Shulman.
