**Rainer Vogt** is is a mathematician specialised in [[homotopy theory]].

He received his Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University and his thesis advisor was [[Michael Boardman]]. He is a a full professor at Osnabr&#252;ck University in Germany.

He coauthored with Boardman the famous book **Homotopy invariant algebraic structures on topological spaces**, Springer Lecture Notes in Math 347 (1973).

This book introduced the notion of [[weak Kan complex]] that was later popularized by [[André Joyal]] under the name [[quasi-category]] as a natural basis for the  [[higher category theory]] of [[(∞,1)-category|(∞,1)-categories]].
