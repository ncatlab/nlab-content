[[!redirects Anticommutative graded codifferential category]]
## Idea

This is a notion in development which is meant to link [[differential categories]] with [[homological algebra]].

For example, the category of modules over a [[commutative ring]], equipped with the [[exterior powers]] is an anticommutative graded codifferential category.

It is hoped for example that the concept of [[differential algebra]] can be studied in this context.
