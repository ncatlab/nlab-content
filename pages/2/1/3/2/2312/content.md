## Idea

A [[cohomology theory]] $E$ is called _multiplicative_ if $E^\bullet(X)$ is not just a [[graded module|graded]] [[abelian group]], but actually a graded [[ring]].

This is in particular the case when the [[spectrum]] $E$ [[Brown representability theorem|representing]] the [[cohomology theory]] is an [[E-âˆž ring]] spectrum.

## Examples

* [[integral cohomology]]

* [[topological K-theory]]

* etc.
