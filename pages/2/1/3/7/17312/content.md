  **Lectures on category theory**

  Bowdoin Summer School (1969)

  Notes taken by [[Ellis Cooper]] &lbrack;[[MacLaneBowdoinLectures69.pdf:file]]&rbrack;

on [[category theory]]. 

These lectures are close to what eventually became the classical textbook _[[Categories for the Working Mathematician]]_.  One difference is a long discussion of [[William Lawvere]]'s dissertation results on [[algebraic theories]].
