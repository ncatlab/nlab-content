## Idea

A **CMon-enriched symmetric monoidal category** is a [[symmetric monoidal category]] such that each [[hom-set]] is a [[commutative monoid]] and the [[tensor product]] on [[morphisms]] and the [[composition]] are [[bilinear]].

This notion is often referred to as [[additive category]] or [[pre-additive category]] in works on [[differential categories]] or [[differential linear logic]]. However these terms classicaly assume more structure, the most obvious being an enrichment over [[abelian groups]] and not only [[commutative monoids]]. This is typical of the attitude in theoretical computer science where one often doesn't assume the presence of negative numbers. In order to prevent confusion, we prefer using the name defended here.


## Definition

In details, a **CMon-enriched symmetric monoidal category** is a symmetric monoidal category such that each hom-set $\mathcal{C}[A,B]$ is a commutative monoid (we write $f + g$ for the [[sum]] of two morphisms $f,g \colon A \rightarrow B$ and $0$ for the [[zero]] $A \rightarrow B$), such that for [[every]] $f,g \colon A \rightarrow B$, $h,i \colon C \rightarrow D$ and $j,k \colon B \rightarrow C$:

* $(f+g)\otimes h = f \otimes h + g \otimes h$
* $f \otimes (h+i) = f \otimes h + f \otimes i$
* $0 \otimes f = f \otimes 0 = 0$
* $(f+g);j = f;j + g;j$
* $f;(j+k) = f;j + f;k$
* $0;f = f;0 = 0$
