While every [[continuous map]] send compacts to compacts, this is not true for preimages. 

A continuous map $f : X \to Y$ between [[topological space]]s is **proper** if the [[inverse image]] of any [[compact space|compact]] subset is compact.

Similarly, one can consider the conditions on morphisms in other geometric situations, like [[algebraic geometry]], and properness often either reflects or implies good behaviour with respect to the compact objects (cf. also proper push-forward). 

A __proper morphism of schemes__ is by a definition a morphism $f:X\to Y$ of finite type which is [[separated morphism|separated]] (i.e. the corresponding diagonal $Y\to Y\times_X Y$ is closed) and universally closed. There is a classical valuative criterium or properness due Chevalley. See Hartshorne or EGA for more details. A short overview on proper morphisms is also at [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_morphism).

The base change formulas for cohomology for proper and for smooth morphisms of schemes motivated Grothendieck (in Pursuing stacks) to define abstract proper and smooth functors in the setting of [[fibered categories]]; this is further expanded on in an article
