## Idea

A **quality type** is a key concept in [[W. Lawvere]]'s axiomatic approach to [[cohesion]] which permits to analyze a [[space]] understood as a domain of _quantitative_ variation via its _qualitative_ aspects. This can be viewed as an [[axiom|axiomatisation]] of the commonly encountered situation in [[geometry]] or [[dynamics]] that problems permit (only) a qualitative analysis.

A primary example for that kind of deferred analysis is the study of [[topological spaces]] via the [[homotopy category]] (hence via the [[homotopy types]] which they represent). So in a very broad sense, quality types are intended as ingredients to a  _synthetic homotopy theory_[^SHT] where the (homotopy) contraction of a space (the collapsing of a [[cylinder object|cylinder]]/two [[idempotents]]) is extracted as essence of the concept of a spatial 'attribute'. 

Technically, a quality type amounts to a special sort of [[essential geometric morphism|essential localization]] and is therefore called a **quintessential localization**  in ([Johnstone 1996](#JS96)).

In typical (topos) cases these come in the form of [[adjoint modalities|adjoint cylinders]] $\Pi\dashv\Delta\dashv\Gamma$ (with $\Delta$ [[fully faithful functor|fully faithful]]) such that the [[connected components]] and the [[global section|global sections functor]] coincide (="collapse"): $\Pi\cong\Gamma$ (cf. [[points-to-pieces transform]]). This implies for spaces in the domain of the functors that every connected component contains exactly one point. Spaces with this property are called **infinitesimal spaces**[^Inf] in ([Lawvere 2008](#Law08)).

Hence from a more _geometrical point of view_, an object in a quality type is a particular simple kind of space with 'degenerate' components, or, if you prefer, a space with 'thick' or 'coarse' points which in turn can be viewed as a minimal vestige of cohesion: when a set is a space with no cohesion, an object in a quality type is a space with _almost_ no cohesion.[^GoC] (For an elaboration of this perspective in the context of [[cohesive toposes]] see at [[infinitesimal cohesion]].)

Quality types together with the _continuity axiom_ are an essential ingredient to Lawvere's [2007 axioms](#Law07) for geometry. ([Lawvere 2008](#Law08)) points to the role of continuity in ensuring that the Hurewicz homotopy category becomes a quality type. The definition of quality type yields important contrasts with _pure variation_ and _sufficient cohesion_ permitting to attend to the _fine structure_ of the [[gros topos|petit-gros]] landscape. So we can say with only slight exaggeration that the 2007 axioms revolve around the concept of a quality type and that cohesive spaces are those that admit qualitative (homotopical) analysis!

In the following we discuss the case for ordinary categories, for the higher order generalization see [[infinitesimal cohesive (infinity,1)-topos]].

## Definition

Let $\mathcal{S},\mathcal{F}$ be [[extensive categories]]. A [[fully faithful functor]] $q^*:\mathcal{S}\to\mathcal{F}$ is said to exhibit $\mathcal{F}$ as a **quality type** over $\mathcal{S}$ if $q^*$ has both a left and a right adjoint which moreover coincide: $q_!\dashv q^*\dashv q_*$ and $q_!\cong q_*$.

Let $\mathcal{E}$ be a (pre)cohesive category over $\mathcal{S}$ and $q^*:\mathcal{S}\to\mathcal{F}$ a quality type over $\mathcal{S}$. A functor $s:\mathcal{E}\to\mathcal{F}$ is called an **intensive quality** on $\mathcal{E}$ if $s$ preserves finite products and finite coproducts and $q_*\circ s =p_*$.

Dually, a finite coproduct preserving functor $h:\mathcal{E}\to\mathcal{F}$ with $q_!\circ h=p_!$ is called an **extensive quality** on $\mathcal{E}$.

Intuitively, an intensive quality is compatible with the points of its domain spaces and an extensive quality with the connected components.

## Examples

> If we divest smooth spaces of all global cohesion, keeping only the jets (on which the Thom-Mather singularities depend), we obtain a category in which every connected component of any object has exactly one point, so that the natural map between those functors is an isomorphism.

### The topos of $\mathbb{F}_1$-actions

Lawvere's work on the petit-gros topos distinction started with the examination of two toposes of graphs ([Lawvere 1986](#Law86)). The first one of _irreflexive graphs_ is given by the presheaf topos of actions of the small diagram category $E\rightrightarrows V$ on $Set$ and is an [[Ã©tendue]] hence petit. 

Whereas the second one of _reflexive graphs_ is given by the actions of the [[graphic monoid]] $\Delta _1=\{1,\partial_0,\partial_1\}$ with $\partial_i\partial_j=\partial_i$ for $i,j=0,1$. $\Delta _1$ is [[Morita equivalence|Morita equivalent]] to the diagram category $E\stackrel{\leftrightarrows}{\leftarrow} V$ and consists entirely of [[idempotents]]. Its topos of actions is gros and when taken over $FinSet$ satisfies the axioms for a (sufficiently) [[cohesive topos]]. The 'abelianization' of $\Delta _1$ is $\mathbb{F}_1=\{0,1\}$, the multiplicative monoid with a generic (nontrivial) idempotent $0$ which incidentally is also the monoid underlying the [[blueprint]] for the [[field with one element]].

As observed in ([Lawvere 1989](#Law89), p.277) $\mathcal{S}^{\mathbb{F}_1^{op}}$ is a quality type over $\mathcal{S}$. It was probably the first one to arise and its status of being neither petit nor gros being commented on.

The surjective homomorphism $q:\Delta_1\to\mathbb{F}_1$ induces an adjoint string $q_!\dashv q^*\dashv q_*:\mathcal{S}^{\Delta_1^{op}}\to\mathcal{S}^{\mathbb{F}_1^{op}}$ with $q_*$ discarding all non-loops in a reflexive graph.

For details how the [[zeta function]] arises via the Burnside ring of $\mathcal{S}^{\mathbb{F}_1^{op}}$ in this context see ([Lawvere 1989](#Law89), pp.291-292).

## Properties

### Quality types as localizations

**Theorem** ([Johnstone 1996](#JS96)) . Let $\mathcal{E}$ be a [[Cauchy completion|Cauchy- complete category]]. The quintessential localizations of $\mathcal{E}$ correspond precisely to idempotent endomorphisms of the identity functor on $\mathcal{E}$. Moreover, quintessential subcategories of $\mathcal{E}$ form a semilattice under intersection.

## Remarks on the literature

The definition of quality types occurs in ([Lawvere 2007](#Law07)) with important additional remarks in ([Lawvere 2008](#Law08)). The first occurrence of a quality type is in the work of the 1980s in the context of the gros topos of graphs: a discussion of this example is in ([Lawvere 1989](#Law89a),  p.277) where already the contrast to sufficient cohesion is observed. ([Lawvere 1991](Law91a), pp.9-10) has a short but suggestive discussion in the context of [[synthetic differential geometry]]. They resurface without an explicit definition in the [2004 paper](Law04) on data types.

Under the name of quintessential localization they are the focus of ([Johnstone 1996](JS96)) where the characterization via central idempotents is given. Some additional results occur in the context of the [[Nullstellensatz]] in ([Johnstone 2011](#JS11)). ([Menni 2014](#Menni14b)) attends to the contrast between quality types and sufficient cohesion.

[^SHT]: The term _synthetic homotopy theory_ is slightly misleading here as Lawvere's ideas don't provide a fully fledged homotopy theory but are rather observations or meditations on the role of the cylinder configuration in the analysis of space and spatial dimension. Important facets of his views are documented in Lawvere [1992](#Law92), [1994](#Law94), [1999](#1999).
In a complementary direction, _[[homotopy type theory]]_ provides a synthetic formulation of [[homotopy theory]] proper, not just of the [[homotopy category]], and _[[cohesive homotopy type theory]]_ implements [[cohesion]] _in_ that natively homotopy-theoretic context. 

[^Inf]: A motivation for this terminology from [[synthetic differential geometry|SDG]] can be found in an intriguing remark in ([Lawvere 1991](Law91a), pp.9-10) in the context of his _theory of dimension_. See also at [[infinitesimal cohesion]].

[^GoC]: From another perspective, one could view an object in a quality type as a set with _germs of cohesion_.
