## Idea


**Substructural logic** is a general term for [[formal logics]] in which the *[[structural inference rules]]*:

* the [[contraction rule]]

* the [[weakening rule]]

* the [[exchange rule]]

are not necessarily assumed, or only with restrictions.

Among substructural logics are the following:

* [[linear logic]], perhaps the best-known to category theorists, which omits the [[contraction rule|contraction]] and [[weakening rules]] (if also the [[exchange rule]] is omitted, one speaks of  *noncommutative linear logic*);

* [[affine logic]] which omits only the [[contraction rule]]. (one might call it *coaffine logic* if also the [[weakening rule]] is omitted);

* some forms of [[relevant logic]] and [[paraconsistent logic]] (often of the coaffine variety).
