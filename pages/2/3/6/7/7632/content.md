## Idea


**Substructural logic** is a general term for [[logics]] in which the *[[structural inference rules]]*:

* the [[contraction rule]]

* the [[weakening rule]]

* the [[exchange rule]]

are not necessarily assumed, or only with restrictions.

Some particular substructural logics include:

* [[linear logic]], perhaps the best-known to category theorists, omits the contraction and weakening rules.  "Noncommutative linear logic" omits also the exchange rule.

* [[affine logic]] omits only the contraction rule.  One might call it "coaffine logic" if we omit only the weakening rule.

* Some forms of [[relevant logic]] and [[paraconsistent logic]] can be regarded as substructural logics (often of the coaffine variety).
