A category is _discrete_ if it contains only identity morphisms. Conversely, for $S$ a collection, one says that the _discrete category over $S$_ is the category with $S$ as its collection of objects and only identity morphisms.

#Remarks#

The idea is that in a discrete category no two points are connectable by any "path". But care has to be taken with the term "discrete" in particular when talking about [[internal category|internal categories]] in spaces: the discrete category over a topological space still remembers the topology on that space.
