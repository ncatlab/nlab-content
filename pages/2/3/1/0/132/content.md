# Categorical meaning #

A [[category]] is **discrete** if it contains only identity morphisms.  The idea is that in a discrete category no two points are connectable by any "path".  ([[small category|Small]]) discrete categories may be identified with [[set|sets]].

Conversely, for $S$ a collection, one says that the _discrete category over $S$_ is the category with $S$ as its collection of objects and only identity morphisms.  


# Topological meaning #

If $C$ is a category [[enriched category|enriched]] or [[internal category|internal]] to [[topological space|topological spaces]], then there is another completely different meaning of **discrete**: that the _topology_ on the arrows (and the objects, in the internal case) is the discrete topology.

This is especially confusing if one extends the use of "discrete category over $S$" to the case of internal categories, when $S$ is an object of some ambient category.  With this usage, if $S$ is a topological space, then the "discrete internal category over $S$" in [[Top]] will not be discrete in the topological sense: it still remembers the topology on that space.
