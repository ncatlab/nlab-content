K&#228;hler manifolds are complex analogues of riemannian manifolds; riemannian manifolds are real differentiable manifolds equipped with a smooth symmetric 2-form $g\in \Gamma(S^2 T^* M)$, while an __almost K&#228;hler manifold__ is a complex holomorphic manifold equipped with a hermitian metric 2-form; the real cotangent bundle is replaced with complex cotangent bundle and symmetry with hermitian symmetry. Almost K&#228;hler manifold is K&#228;hler if it satisfies and additional integrability condition. K&#228;hler 2-form can be decomposed as $h = g+i\omega$; here $g$ is a riemannian metric and $\omega$ a symplectic form. There is a unique up to a scalar hermitian metric on a complex projective space (which can be normalized), the Fubini-Study metric. All analytic subvarieties of a complex projective space are in fact algebraic subvarieties and they inherit the K&#228;hler structure from the projective space. Examples include complex tori $\mathbb{C}^n/L$ where $L$ is a lattice in $\mathbb{C}^n$, K3-surfaces, compact Calabi-Yau manifolds, quadrics, products of projective spaces and so on. 

K&#228;hler manifolds were first introduced and studied by P. A. Shirokov (cf. [a historical article](http://dx.doi.org/10.1070/RM1995v050n02ABEH002098)) and later independently by K&#228;hler.
