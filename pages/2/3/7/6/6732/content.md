## Idea

For classes of [[gauge theories]], such as ([[super Yang-Mills theory|super]]) [[Yang-Mills theory]] or [[Chern-Simons theory]] or various [[matrix models]],  whose [[gauge groups]] may be $N \times N$ [[square matrices]] for any [[natural number]] $N$, notably in the [[special unitary group]] $SU(N)$, the [[special orthogonal group]] $SO(N)$ or the [[quaternionic unitary group]] ("symplectic group") $Sp(N)$, one may consider the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] of the theory's [[scattering amplitudes]] and other [[quantum observables]] as $N\to \infty$ ("large [[number of colours]]-limit"). In good cases the values close to but away from this _large $N$ limit_ scale with $1/N$ and allow a [[perturbation series]] around the large $N$ limit called the _$1/N$ expansion_.

This _large $N$ limit_ often has remarkable properties, often revealing an otherwise hidden relation to [[perturbative string theories]] with the parameter $1/N$ proportional to the [[string coupling constant]].

Notably for [[Yang-Mills theory]] and in particular for [[QCD]], the large $N$-behaviour is exhibited by rewriting the [[Feynman amplitudes]] in [['t Hooft double line notation]]. If the [['t Hooft coupling]] $g^2 N$  is held fixed as $N\to \infty$, this turns out to organize the gauge theory's [[Feynman perturbation series]] by the [[Euler characteristic]]/[[genus of a surface|genus]] of emerging [[string theory|string]] [[worldsheet]] [[surfaces]], with genus 0 ([[planar graphs]]) dominating in the large $N$ limit, whence also called the _[[planar limit]]_.

([[open/closed string duality|Open/closed string duality]] plays a subtle role in interpreting the [['t Hooft double line notation]] of [[gauge theory]] [[Feynman diagrams]] in the [[large N limit]] alternatively as [[open string]] or as [[closed string]] [[worldsheets]], see [Gopakumar-Vafa 98](#GopakumarVafa98), [Gaiotto-Rastelli 03](#GaiottoRastelli03), [Gopakumar 04](#Gopakumar04) and notably
[Marino 04, Section III, p. 14](#Marino04)).

At least for the case of [[super Yang-Mills theories]] the full statement of the relation of large-$N$ gauge theory to a [[perturbative string theory]] is the content of the _[[AdS/CFT correspondence]]_, which explains that the effective [[string]] [[worldsheets]] emerging from the [[gauge theory]] propagate in a higher-dimensional asymptotically [[anti-de Sitter spacetime]] (the [[near horizon geometry]] of a [[black brane]]) whose [[asymptotic boundary]] (the [[worldvolume]] of the [[black brane]] itself) is identified with the [[spacetime]] of the original [[gauge theory]].

An extreme case of this large $N$-limit is that of the [[BFSS matrix model]] in [[AdS2/CFT1 duality]] where _all_ spatial dependence of [[field (physics)|fields]] in the higher dimensional spacetime is supposedly encoded in the [[quantum mechanics]] of $N\times N$ [[matrix model|matrices]] as $N\to \infty$. And for the [[IKKT matrix model]] this includes also the temporal dependence.

For non-[[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] [[gauge theories]] such as [[QCD]] this [[duality in string theory|duality]] still holds in suitably adjusted form such as in the _[[AdS/QCD correspondence]]_. Here the $1/N$-expansion serves to provide a computational tool for describing [[confinement|confined]] [[hadron]] states ([[mesons]] and [[baryons]], hence in particular [[nucleons]] and hence ordinary room-temperature [[matter]]) which are not seen by ordinary [[perturbative quantum field theory|perturbation theory]] in the gauge theory [[coupling constant]] (the [[confinement]]/[[mass gap problem]]).

  > [26:26](https://youtu.be/TvIz-6YOdKs?t=1586): "by now it's clear &lbrack;[Lucini & Teper 2001](large+N+limit#LuciniTeper01)&rbrack; that [[lattice gauge theory]], at least for the [[glueball]] sector, has made it clear that the [[large N limit|$1/N$-expansion]] is a good approximation to the real world, especially if you include a leading correction to the [[large N limit|large $N$ limit]]. Now unfortunately this is best established in the [[glueball]] sector, which is not very accessible experimentally."
  
  > [28:56](https://youtu.be/TvIz-6YOdKs?t=1736): "but the $1/N$ expansion doesn't explain everything. In fact, it's not hard to find phenomena in meson physics where the $1/N$-expansion does *not* work well."

> Nowadays we interpret $[$ the [['t Hooft double line notation]] $]$ quite literally as the perturbative expansion of an open string theory, either because the full open string theory is just equal to the gauge
theory (as e.g. for Chern-Simons theory [27]), or because we take an appropriate
low-energy limit (as e.g. for N = 4 SYM [31]).

> The general speculation [1] is that upon summing over the number of holes, (1.1) can be recast as the genus expansion for some closed string theory of coupling $g_s = g_{YM}^2$. This speculation is sometimes justified by appealing to the intuition that diagrams with
a larger and larger number of holes look more and more like smooth closed Riemann surfaces. This intuition is perfectly appropriate for the double-scaled matrix models, where the finite N theory is interpreted as a discretization of the closed Riemann surface; to recover the continuum limit, one must send $N\to \infty$ and tune $t$ to the
critical point $t_c$ where diagrams with a diverging number of holes dominate.

>  However, in AdS/CFT, or in the Gopakumar-Vafa duality [2], $t$ is a free parameter, corresponding on the closed string theory side to a geometric modulus. The intuition described above clearly goes wrong here. 

> A much more fitting way in which the open/closed duality may come about in these cases is for each fatgraph of genus g and
with h holes to be replaced by a closed Riemann surface of the same genus g and with h punctures: each hole is filled and replaced by a single closed string insertion.
