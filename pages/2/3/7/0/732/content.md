##Idea##
A **group $T$-complex** is ''a [[simplicial T-complex]]'' internal to the category of groups.


More precisely:

##Definition##

A **group $T$-complex** is a pair,  $(G,T)$, in which $G$ is a [[simplicial group]] and $T$ is a graded subgroup  of $G$ consisting of _thin_ elements,  and which satisfies the conditions:

* Every degenerate element is thin.
* Every [[horn]] in $G$ has a unique thin filler.
* A thin filler of a thin box also has its last face thin.

######Lemma

Let $D = (D_n)_{n\geq 1}$ be the graded subgroup of $G$ generated by the
images of the degeneracy maps, $s_i :G_n \rightarrow G_{n+1}$, for all $i$ and
$n$,  then any box in $G$ has a  filler in $D$.

######Proof
The algorithmic formulae
used when proving that any simplicial group is a Kan complex (cf., entry on  [[simplicial group]]) give a filler defined as a product of degenerate copies of the faces of the given box, so is in $D_n$.

######Proposition
If $(G,T)$ is a group $T$-complex then $T = D$.

######Proof

 To see this, we note that
as every degenerate element is this, $D \subseteq T$. Conversely if $t \in T_n$, then it
fills the box made up of $ (  - , d_1t, \ldots, d_n t )$.  This, in turn, has a
filler, $d$, in  $D$, but, as this filler is also thin, it must be that $t = d$, 
since thin fillers are uniquely determined.
