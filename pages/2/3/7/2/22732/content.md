## Idea

### Chern insulators

In [[solid state physics]], a [[topological insulator]] which is *not* "[[symmetry protected topological phase|protected by any symmetry]]" has a [[valence bundle]] $V$ over the [[Brillouin torus]] $\mathbb{R}^d$ which is a [[complex vector bundle]] unconstrained by any reality or other conditions, and hence whose class in [[complex K-theory]] $KU^0(\mathbb{T}^d)$ is thought to classify the [[topological phase of matter|topological phase]] of the "unprotected" [[topological insulator]], according to the expected [[K-theory classification of topological phases of matter]].

Now the [[Brillouin torus]] of a realistic material is of effective [[dimension of a manifold|dimension]] $d \leq 3$ and over spaces of these dimensions the only [[characteristic class]] of a [[complex vector bundle]] is its [[first Chern class]]  $c_1(V) \,\in\, H^2\big(\mathbb{T}^d; \, \mathbb{Z}\big)$. Specifically for effectively 2-dimensional materials, the first *Chern number* $c_1[V] = \int_{\mathbb{T}^2} c_1(V) \,\in\, \mathcal{C}$ coincides with this K-theory class:

\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=2pt, column sep=0pt]
  KU^0
  \big(
    \mathbb{T}^2_\ast
  \big)
  &\simeq&
  KU^0
  \big(
    S^2_\ast
  \big)
  &\simeq&
  \mathbb{Z}
  \\
  {[V]} 
  \ar[rrrr, |->]
  &&&&
  c_1[V]
\end{tikzcd}

For this reason such "symmetry un-protected" topological insulators are commonly known as *Chern insulators* and the [[first Chern class|first Chern number]] of their [[valence bundle]] is regarded as labeling their [[topological phases of matter|topological phase]].

### Haldane model & QAHE

While, mathematically, the case without any quantum symmetry is the simplest one, physically this typically has to be realized with more effort by starting with a symmetry-protected material (such as [[graphene]]) and then "[[symmetry breaking|breaking]]" its symmetries (either by manipulating the material in the lab or, quite often, just theoretically by adding more terms to the [[Hamiltonian]] of its theoretical model).

Therefore it is regarded as a seminal achievement when the *[[Haldane model]]* was found, which *intrinsically* breaks the symmetries of an idealized  graphene-like model (by [[spin-orbit coupling]]) and which is generally regarded as the archetype of a (model for a) Chern insulator.

An *extrinsic* way to break the [[time-reversal symmetry]] of a material like [[graphene]] is to simply place it in an external [[magnetic field]]; in this case one sometimes speaks of a *[[quantum Hall material]]*, instead. 

With reference to this relation, the intrinsic effect that breaks the [[time-reversal symmetry]] of some material to a Chern insulator-phase is also known as a *[[quantum anomalous Hall effect]]* (QAHE).


### Chern semi-metals

If a Chern insulator is deformed (mentally at least) to a [[semi-metal]] with band gap closures over isolated nodal points $\{k_1, \cdots, k_N\}$ in the [[Brillouin torus]], then the relevant domain space becomes the [[complement]] $\mathbb{T}^3 \setminus \{k_1, \cdots, k_N\}$, which admits non-trivial Chern numbers for each puncture, corresponding to the evaluation of $c_1(V)$ on any [[2-sphere]] surrounding the $I$th nodal point. This now measures the topological protection of the semimetal phase (see eg. [Mathai-Thiang 17b](semi-metal#MathaiThiang17b) for a transparent account). 

Some authors speak of "Chern semi-metals" to amplify this.
