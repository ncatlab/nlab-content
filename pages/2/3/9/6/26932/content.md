## Relation to Einstein

[[Albert Einstein]] on his work with Grossmann:

>  I am now occupied exclusively with the gravitational problem &lbrack;i.e. [[general relativity]]/[[gravity]]&rbrack;, and believe that I can overcome all difficulties with the help of a local mathematician friend &lbrack;[[Marcel Grossmann]]&rbrack;. But one thing is certain, never before in my life have I troubled myself over anything so much, and that I have gained great respect for mathematics, whose more subtle parts I considered until now, in my ignorance, as pure luxury! Compared with this problem, the original theory of relativity &lbrack;i.e. [[special relativity]]&rbrack; is childish.
