## Idea

An $n$-connected space is a generalisation of the pattern:

*  [[space]],
*  [[inhabited set|inhabited space]],
*  [[path-connected space]],
*  [[simply connected space]],
*  etc.


## Definition

A [[topological space]] is __$n$-connected__ or __$n$-simply connected__ if its [[homotopy groups]] are trivial up to degree $n$.


## Special cases

*  Any space is $(-2)$-simply connected.

*  A space is $(-1)$-simply connected precisely if it has an element; that is if it is [[inhabited set|inhabited]].

*  A space is $0$-simply connected precisely if it is [[path-connected space|path-connected]].

*  A space is $1$-simply connected precisely if it is [[simply connected space|simply connected]].

*  A space is $\infty$-simply connected precisely if it is [[contractible space|weakly contractible]].


## Terminology

The traditional terminology is '$n$-connected', but this violates the rule that '$1$-foo' should mean the same as 'foo'.  This can be fixed by saying '$n$-simply connected' instead, which also has the advantage of stressing that we are extending the change from connected to simply connected spaces.
