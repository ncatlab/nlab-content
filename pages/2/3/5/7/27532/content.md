## Idea

In the context of [[finite groups]], an **elementary group** is one [[isomorphism|isomorphic]], for some [[prime number]] $p$, to the [[direct product]] of 

* a [[p-primary group|$p$-primary group]] 

with 

* a [[cyclic group]] whose [[group order|order]] is [[relatively prime]] to $p$. 

The concept of *elementary subgroups*, that is of [[subgroups]] that are elementary as groups, is used in some variants of the [[Brauer induction theorem]].
