## Idea

In the context of [[finite groups]], an **elementary group** is a group of [[order]] $p^n$ times a [[cyclic group]] whose order is relatively prime to $p$. 

The concept of an elementary subgroup of a group, that is, a subgroup that is elementary as a group, is used in some variants of the [[Brauer induction theorem]].
