[[regular differential operator|Regular differential operators]] have been nontrivially generalized to noncommutative rings (and schemes) by [[Valery Lunts|V. Lunts]] and [[Alexander Rosenberg|A. L. Rosenberg]], as well as to the setting of braided monoidal categories. 

The following two papers dwell mainly on the affine and projective cases

(N.S.)  __3__  (1997),  no. 3, 335--359 ([doi](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s000290050014)); sequel: _Localization for quantum groups_, Selecta Math. (N.S.) __5__ (1999), no. 1, pp. 123--159 ([doi](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s000290050044)).

and the following two unpublished preprints outline a more general categorical and geometric picture including the [[Sasha Beilinson|Beilinson]]'s notion of [[D-affinity]] generalized to (co)monads

Their motivation is an analogue of a Beilinson-Bernstein localization theorem for [[quantum groups]]. The category of differential bimodules is categorically characterized in their work as the minimal [[coreflective subcategory|coreflective]] [[topologizing subcategory| topologizing]] [[monoidal category|monoidal]] subcategory of the abelian monoidal category of $R$-$R$-bimodules which is containing $R$. In the case of noncommutative rings, Lunts-Rosenberg definition of differential operators has been recovered from a different perspective in the setup of [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]] represented by monoidal categories; the emphasis is on the duality between infinitesimals and differential operators:

There are some other approaches to rings of differential operators in noncommutative geometry. In easy semicommutative cases (like nilpotent thickenings of commutative schemes) one can use the standard Grothendieck definition without change. On the other hand, there is an approahc by generators and relations in affine case, corresponding to the recipe for preprojective algebras of quivers. It has some nice localization properties and relations to double derivations and double Poisson geometry. See papers by Yuri Berest and
