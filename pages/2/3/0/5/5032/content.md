## Idea

By [[categorification]] of the notion of [[geometric morphism]], an _$(\infty,1)$-geometric morphism_ is a pair of [[adjoint (∞,1)-functor]]s between [[(∞,1)-topos]]es where the leftadjoint is left-exact. 


## Definition

For $\mathbf{H}$ and $\mathbf{K}$ two [[(∞,1)-topos]]es, a **$(\infty,1)$-geometric morphism** $f : \mathbf{H} \to \mathbf{K}$ is

* an [[(∞,1)-functor]] $f_* : \mathbf{H} \to \mathbf{K}$ 

  (called the [[direct image]] of the geometric morphism)

* which has a left [[adjoint (∞,1)-functor]] $\mathbf{H} \leftarrow \mathbf{K} : f^*$;

  (called the [[inverse image]] of the geometric morphism)

* such that $f^*$ is a left [[exact (∞,1)-functor]].

The (non-full) [[sub-(∞,1)-category]] of [[(∞,1)Cat]] on [[(∞,1)-toposes]] and $(\infty,1)$-geometric morphisms between them is  [[(∞,1)Toposes]].


## Examples

* [[terminal geometric morphism]]

* [[locally infinity-connected (infinity,1)-topos|locally $\infty$-connected $\infty$-topos]]

* [[cohesive (infinity,1)-topos|cohesive $\infty$-topos]]
