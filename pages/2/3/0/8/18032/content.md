## Idea
An elementary substructure $N \preceq M$ of a [[model]] of a [[first-order theory]] is an _ultraroot_ of $M$ if $M$ is isomorphic to an [[ultrapower]] of $N$.

## Definition
Formally, recall that any structure $N$ admits a diagonal elementary embedding $N \overset{\Delta}{\to} N^{\mathcal{U}}$ to any ultrapower $N^{\mathcal{U}}$ of $N$.

If $i : N \to M$ is an elementary embedding, we say that $N$ is an ultraroot of $M$ if there is some ultrafilter $\mathcal{U}$ on some index set such that there is an isomorphism

$$
\left(N \overset{i}{\to} M\right) \simeq \left(N \overset{\Delta}{\to} N^{\mathcal{U}}\right)
$$
in the [[co-slice category]] under $N$. 

## Examples

* $N$ is an ultraroot of $N^{\mathcal{U}}$.

* Assuming the [[continuum hypothesis]], any countable model of a complete-first order theory will be an ultraroot of that theory's $\aleph_1$-saturated continuum-sized model.

* Similarly, taking a countably-indexed ultrapower of a slightly-expanded copy (like a nonstandard model generated by throwing in a single infinitesimal) of the reals still yields the [[hyperreal numbers]].

## Remarks
Closure under taking ultraroots, along with closure under ultraproducts and elementary embeddings, gives a criterion for detecting [[elementary class of structures|elementary classes]].
