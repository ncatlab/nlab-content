## Idea

The concept of _traced monoidal category_ axiomatizes the structure on a [[monoidal category]] for it to have a sensible notion of [[trace]] the way it exists canonically in [[compact closed categories]].

## Properties

### Categorical semantics

Traced monoidal categories serve as an "operational" [[categorical semantics]] for [[linear logic]], known as _[[Geometry of Interactions]]_. See there for more
