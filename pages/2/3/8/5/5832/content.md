## Idea

Barr's theorem states: If a statement in [[geometric logic]] is deducible from a [[geometric theory]] using classical [[logic]] and the [[axiom of choice]], then it is also
deducible from it in [[constructive mathematics]]. 


The proof of Barr's theorem itself, however, is highly non-constructive.
