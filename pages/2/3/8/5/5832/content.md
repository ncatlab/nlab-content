## Idea

Barr's theorem states: If a statement in [[geometric logic]] is deducible from a [[geometric theory]] using classical [[logic]] and the [[axiom of choice]], then it is also
deducible from it in [[constructive mathematics]]. 


The proof of Barr's theorem itself, however, is highly non-constructive. 

## Statement

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

If $\mathcal{E}$ is a [[Grothendieck topos]], then there is a  [[surjective geometric morphism]]

$$
  \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{E}
$$

where $\mathcal{F}$ satisfies the [[axiom of choice]].
