## Idea

**Barr's theorem** was originally conjectured by [[William Lawvere]] as an infinitary generalization of the [[Deligne completeness theorem]] for [[coherent toposes]] which can be expressed as the existence of a surjection $\mathcal{S}/K\to\mathcal{E}$ for a coherent topos $\mathcal{E}$ with set of points $K$. General toposes $\mathcal{E}$ may fail to have [[enough points]] but [[Michael Barr]] showed that a surjection from a suitable [[Boolean topos]] still exists.

As surjections permit the transfer of logical properties, Barr's theorem has the following important consequence:

> If a statement in [[geometric logic]] is deducible from a [[geometric theory]] using classical [[logic]] and the [[axiom of choice]], then it is also
deducible from it in [[constructive mathematics]]. 

The proof of Barr's theorem itself, however, is highly non-constructive. 

## Statement

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

If $\mathcal{E}$ is a [[Grothendieck topos]], then there is a  [[surjective geometric morphism]]

$$
  \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{E}
$$

where $\mathcal{F}$ satisfies the [[axiom of choice]].

## Remark

[[Deligne completeness theorem|Deligne's completeness theorem]] says that a coherent Grothendieck topos has enough points in $Set$ and this corresponds to the G&#246;del-Henkin completeness theorem for first-order theories. Similarly, Barr's theorem can interpreted as saying that a Grothendieck topos has sufficient _Boolean-valued_ points and is in turn closely related to Mansfield's **Boolean-valued completeness theorem** for infinitary first-order theories.
