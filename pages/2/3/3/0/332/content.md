> "Geometry is founded in mechanical practice, and is nothing but that part of universal mechanics which accurately proposes and demonstrates the art of measuring." &lbrack;[[Philosophiæ naturalis principia mathematica|Newton (1687)]], <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:Newton%27s_Principia_(1846).djvu/73">preface</a>&rbrack;

In its historical and etymological origins, "geometry" is the science of *measuring the earth* and here specifically of measuring *[[distances]]* and *[[angles]]*, first in the guise of [[Euclidean geometry]] of the ancients and then eventually as the *[[differential geometry of curves and surfaces]]* due to [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] and others.

But in modern [[mathematics|mathematical]] jargon, the term *geometry* is used in much greater generality for the study of *[[spaces]]* equipped with [[extra structure|extra]] "geometrical" [[structure]] of a large variety of sorts, foremost in the guise of *[[Riemannian geometry]]* but subsuming also a wealth of variant notions of "geometries" which the ancient would not have recognized as such, for instance *[[symplectic geometry]]* and other ([[torsion of a G-structure|torsion]]-free) *[[G-structure|$G$-structured]]* [[differentiable manifolds]] (*[[differential geometry|differential]] [[Cartan geometry]]*), or ([[higher topos theory|higher]]) [[topos]]-theoretic notions (cf. "[[geometric logic]]") of ([[higher geometry|higher]]) *[[functorial geometry]]* famously including *[[algebraic geometry]]* or *[[supergeometry]]* but also more exotic variants such as *[[arithmetic geometry]]* or *[[absolute geometry]]*. Finally, taking the [[duality between algebra and geometry]] to the extreme yields notions of *[[noncommutative geometry]]* and/or *[[derived geometry]]* whose underlying "spaces" are only indirectly conceived as whatever it is that given ([[higher algebra|higher]]) [[algebras]] would see (measure!) if they are interpreted as [[algebras of functions]] on a would-be space --- which on the one hand is far remote from what Newton must have imagined geometry to be about, but on the other hand is quite in the spirit of geometry being about (maybe not space as such but) *[[measurement|measuring]]* space.

Beware that bare *[[topology]]* is sometimes regarded as a rudimentary kind of geometry (as reflected for instance in the common terminology *[[geometric realization]]* for an operation that really is *[[topological realization]]*), but more often than not a "geometric space" is meant to be a *[[topological space]]* equipped with [[extra structure|extra]] geometrical [[structure]], of sorts.

Even a plain [[differentiable manifold]] as considered in [[differential geometry]] is often not quite regarded as *geometric* in itself unless equipped with further structure, as reflected for instance in the terminology *[[topological field theory]]* for those [[functorial field theories]] which depend on [[diffeomorphism]]-structure of [[spacetime]] but not on further (notably [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo]]-[[Riemannian geometry|Riemannian]]) geometric structure.
