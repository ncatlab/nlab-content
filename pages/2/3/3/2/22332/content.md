## Idea

The notion of _Twisted Equivariant Differential (TED) K-theory_ is meant to be the joint generalization of all three variations of [[topological K-theory]] given by:

1. [[twisted K-theory]]

1. [[equivariant K-theory]]

1. [[differential K-theory]]

hence the joint generalization of:

1. [[twisted equivariant K-theory]]

1. [[twisted differential K-theory]]

1. [[equivariant differential K-theory]].


It is this joint generalization that is, ultimately, required by 

1. the [[K-theory classification of D-brane charge]], 

   conjectured to apply to [[M-theory|non-perturbative]] [[type II string theory]];

1. the [[K-theory classification of topological phases of matter]], 

   conjectured to apply in [[topological phases of matter|topological]] [[condensed matter theory]].


## References

The construction of full _twisted & equivariant & differential_ cohomology theories had long been left open. It does follow as an immediate consequence of the _[[schreiber:The Character Map in Twisted Non-Abelian Cohomology|twisted]] & [[schreiber:The Character Map in Equivariant Twistorial Cohomotopy|equivariant]]_ [[Chern-Dold character]] and as such is discussed in:

* [[Hisham Sati]], [[Urs Schreiber]], _

  **[[schreiber:Twisted Equivariant Differential non-abelian generalized cohomology|Twisted Equivariant Differential non-abelian generalized cohomology]]** 

  (in preparation)

The twisted + equivariant + *flat* differential sector of K-theory is more readily described:
