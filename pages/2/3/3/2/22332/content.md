## Idea

The notion of _twisted equivariant differential K-theory_ is meant to be the joint generalization of all three variations of [[topological K-theory]] given by

1. [[twisted K-theory]]

1. [[equivariant K-theory]]

1. [[differential K-theory]]

hence the joint generalization of 

1. [[twisted equivariant K-theory]]

1. [[twisted differential K-theory]]

1. [[equivariant differential K-theory]].

It is this joint generalization that is, ultimately, required by the [[D-brane charge quantization in topological K-theory]] conjectured to apply to [[non-perturbative effects|non-perturbative]] [[type II string theory]].

## References

The construction of full _twisted & equivariant & differential_ cohomology theories had long been left open. It does follow as an immediate consequence of the _[[schreiber:The Character Map in Twisted Non-Abelian Cohomology|twisted]] & [[schreiber:The Character Map in Equivariant Twistorial Cohomotopy|equivariant]]_ [[Chern-Dold character]] and as such is discussed in:
