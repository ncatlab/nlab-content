Grothendieck has envisioned a deep picture on a hypothetical category of pure and mixed [[motives]] of varieties which has partly been fullfilled so far. This entry gives only some pointers to approaches via dg-categories and their cousins, pretriangulated [[A-infinity categories]].

Using [[derived algebraic geometry]] Maxim Kontsevich embeds the search for motives of varieties into the search of motives of the dg or $A_\infty$-enhancements of the derived categories of coherent sheaves on the noncommutative varieties, what denotes in algebraic geometry working with a bit larger class of pretriangulated $A-\infty$-categories. There are also dg-approaches to the Voevodsky's derived category of [[mixed motive]]s.
