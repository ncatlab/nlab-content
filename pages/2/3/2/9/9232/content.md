## Idea


In [[perturbative quantum field theory]], it is suggestive to think of the [[edges]] in the [[Feynman diagrams]] as [[worldlines]] of "virtual particles" and of the [[vertices]] as the points where they collide and transmute. (Care must be exercised not to confuse this with concepts of real [[particles]].) 

This intuition is made precise by the _[[worldline formalism]]_ of [[perturbative quantum field theory]] ([Strassler 92](worldline+formalism#Strassler92)). This is the perspective on [[perturbative QFT]] which directly relates [[perturbative QFT]] to [[perturbative string theory]] ([Schmidt-Schubert 94](worldline+formalism#SchmidtSchubert94)). In fact the [[worldline formalism]] for [[perturbative QFT]] was originally found by taking thre point-particle limit of [[string scattering amplitudes]] ([Bern-Kosower 91](worldline+formalism#BernKosower91), [Bern-Kosower 92](worldline+formalism#BernKosower92)).
