## Definition

A **semisimple ring** $R$ is one obeying any of the following equivalent conditions: 

* $R$ is an [[Artinian ring]] with vanishing [[Jacobson radical]].

* $R$ is a finite [[product]] of [[simple ring|simple]] Artinian rings.

* As a left [[module]] over itself, $R$ is a [[semisimple object]] in the category of left $R$-modules. 

* As a right module over itself, $R$ is a semisimple object in the category of right $R$-modules.

* The category of [[finitely generated module|finitely generated]] left $R$-modules is a [[semisimple category]].

* The category of finitely generated right $R$-modules is a semisimple category.

For [[commutative rings]], a semisimple ring is a ring which is both an Artinian ring and a [[reduced ring]]. 

## Examples

By the [[Wedderburn-Artin theorem]], every semisimple ring is a finite product of matrix algebras over [[division rings]].

As a special case, every semisimple [[commutative ring]] is a finite product of [[fields]].  In particular, every semisimple [[integral domain]] is a [[field]].  Similarly, every semisimple [[local ring]] is a [[field]].

Beware: not every [[simple ring]] is a semisimple ring.  A simple ring is semisimple if and only if it is Artinian.  For example the [[Weyl algebra]] over any field is a simple ring that is not Artinian and not semisimple: intuitively speaking, it is "too infinite" to be Artinian, which is a kind of finiteness condition.  The ring of linear transformations of an infinite-dimensional vector space over field is also simple but not Artinian and thus not semisimple.
