**&#201;lie Joseph Cartan** was a French differential geometer. His results include the classification of complex semisimple Lie algebras ("Cartan classification"), extension of these results to a class of symmetric spaces, the proof of Lie-Cartan's theorem (after Serre sometimes called [[Lie's three theorems|"Lie's third theorem"]]) on integration of Lie algebras to Lie groups (Lie proved just the integration to [[local Lie group]]s), method of moving frames, introduction of Cartan's connection, numerous results in Riemannian geometry, results related to formal integrability of PDEs (Cartan involutive equations, Pfaffian systems) etc.
