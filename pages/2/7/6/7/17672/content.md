##Idea

In the context of [[idempotent (∞,1)-monads]] or comonads, or _moments_, the **negative moment** is the [[homotopy fiber]] of the [[unit of an adjunction|unit]] or [[homotopy cofiber]] of the counit. 

These are denoted, e.g., $\overline{\sharp}$, $\overline{\flat}$.

* The negative of $id$ (both as monad and comonad) is $\ast$.
* The negative of $\ast$ is $id$.
* The negative of $\emptyset$ is the [[maybe monad]], although not itself idempotent, so not a moment.
