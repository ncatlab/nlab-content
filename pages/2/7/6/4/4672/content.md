## Definition

The [[category]] **$Lie Alg$** is that whose [[object]]s are [[Lie algebra]]s $(\mathfrak{g}, [-,-]_{\mathfrak{g}})$ and whose morphisms are Lie algebra [[homomorphisms]], that is linear maps $\phi\colon \mathfrak{g} \to \mathfrak{h}$ such that for all $x,y \in \mathfrak{g}$ we have

$$
  \phi( [x,y]_{\mathfrak{g}}) = [\phi(x),\phi(y)]_\mathfrak{h}
  \,.
$$

If Lie algebras are expressed in terms of their [[Chevalleyâ€“Eilenberg algebra]]s (and if restricted to finite-dimensional Lie algebras), this may equivalently be characterized as follows: 

$Lie Alg$ is the [[full subcategory]] of the [[opposite category]] of the category [[dgAlg]] of [[dg-algebras]] on those dg-algebras whose underlying [[graded algebra]] is a [[Grassmann algebra]], i.e. of the form $\wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}$.
