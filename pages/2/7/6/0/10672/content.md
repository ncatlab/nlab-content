## Idea

A _Lagrangian cobordism_ is roughly a [[cobordism]] between [[Lagrangian submanifolds]] which is itself a [[Lagrangian submanifold]] in a suitable sense.

More in detail, given an ambient [[symplectic manifold]] $(X, \omega)$, a _Lagrangian cobordism_ in $X$ is a [[cobordism]] with an [[embedding]] into $([0,1] \times \mathbb{R} \times X )$ as a [[Lagrangian submanifold]] (where $[0,1] \times \mathbb{R} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ is equipped with its canonical [[symplectic structure]]) and such that the [[boundary]] components are [[Lagrangian submanifolds]] of $X$. (for details see e.g. [Biran-Cornea 11, 2.1.1](#BiranCornea11)).

Lagrangian cobordisms in $(X,\omega)$ arrange into a [[stable (infinity,1)-category]] which is supposed to be at least closely related to the [[Fukaya category]] of $(X,\omega)$ ([Nadler-Tannaka 11](#NadlerTannaka11)).
