**[Math-Phys-Cat](https://math-phys.group)** is a Brazilian research group concerned with [[mathematical physics|Mathematical-Physics]], [[categorification]] and [[higher category theory and physics]]. We are mainly interested in mathematical aspects of [[classical field theory|classical]] and [[quantum field theories]], especially those involving [[category theory]] and [[gauge theory]], also in the axiomatization problem of astrophysics and in using [[category theory|category-theoretic]] language in order to unify and abstract concepts in classical [[algebra]] and in [[differential geometry]].

## Activies

* [Math-Phys-Cat Seminars](https://math-phys.group/Activities/Math-Phys-CatSeminars), more devoted to graduate topics and research. External speakers are welcome. Recordings are in our [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCjnnTiyS19M89olqLQQWOw).
*  [Student Seminars](https://math-phys.group/Activities/StudentSeminars). These are weekly seminars presented by our students, typically to their advisors our to a small group of people interested in the topics.
* [General Seminars](https://math-phys.group/Activities/GeneralSeminars). Seminars on general topics in the interface between mathematics and physics. Used to encourage the interaction between our students and also to find potential new members.
* [Courses](https://math-phys.group/Activities/Courses). Normally graduate courses and minicourses given by members of our group on our research topics.

## Math-Phys-Cat *Wiki*

Recently we created the [Math-Phys-Cat *Wiki*](wiki.math-phys.group), serving two purposes:

* share our research in the format we find most accessible and perhaps find new collaborations.
* be a repository for reference lists on our research topics. Contributions are welcome.
