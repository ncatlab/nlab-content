## Idea

The _Bost-Connes system_ ([Bost-Connes 95](#BostConnes95)) is the [[semigroup]] [[crossed product C*-algebra]] $C^\ast(\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z})\rtimes \mathbb{N}^\times$ equipped with a canonical 1-parameter flow $t\mapsto\exp(-t H)$, and as such thought of as a [[quantum mechanical system]].

The point is that the [[partition function]] of this system is the [[Riemann zeta function]] ([Bost-Connes 95, theorem 5 (c) (page 6)](#BostConnes95)). 

[[Alain Connes]] has proposed that via this relation there might be a way to shed insight on the [[Riemann hypothesis]] using tools from [[quantum mechanics]] and [[statistical mechanics]] ([Connes-Marcolli 06](#ConnesMarcolli06)). See also at _[[Riemann hypothesis and physics]]_.
