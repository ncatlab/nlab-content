The Palatini- or [[first-order formulation of gravity|first order formulation]] of the Einstein-Hilbert action for gravity is

$$
  \epsilon_{a b c d} \int_X R^{a b} \wedge  e^c \wedge e^d
$$

where

* $(R^{a b})$ is the curvature of an $\mathfrak{so}(n,1)$-[[connection on a bundle|connection]]

* $(e^a)$ is the vielbein.

This is reminiscent of the form of the [[action functional]] in [[BF-theory]]

$$
  \int_X F^{a b} \wedge B_{a b}
  \,.
$$

Various proposals for extensions of this action functional have been made that feature $B$ as an independent field as indicated but then include some dynamical constraint which ensures that on-shell one has $B^{a b} = \epsilon_{a b c d} e^c \wedge e^d$.
