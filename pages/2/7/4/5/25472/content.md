## Idea
**Fibred category theory** is that part of [[category theory]] concerned with the study of [[fibred categories]].

Fibred categories behave (and, in a sense, are) like [[categories]] parametrized by some other category, or put differently, like families of categories bundled together in a single object.
Hence the [[2-category]] of fibred categories]] over a fixed base has many formal analogies with the [[Cat|2-category of categories]], and this is one of the main focus of fibred category theory: to study the 'category theory of fibred categories'.

Lots of fibred category theory is done at a higher level of generality, dealing with [[Street fibrations]] in any 2-category instead of specializing to [[Cat]].
