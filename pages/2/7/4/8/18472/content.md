This page collects material related to the textbook

* [[Günter Scharf]], 

  _Quantum Gauge Theories -- A True Ghost Story_, 

  Wiley 2001

which applies [[causal perturbation theory]] to rigorously construct quantum [[Yang-Mills theory]] ([[quantum chromodynamics]] and [[electroweak field|electroweak theory]]) and [[quantum gravity]] as [[perturbative quantum field theories]].

In later editions the title has been changed. The most recent, third edition is 

* _Gauge Field Theories: Spin One and Spin Two: 100 Years After General Relativity_, [Dover](http://store.doverpublications.com/0486805247.html), 2016,

with extra chapter 6: _Non-geometric general relativity_, based (it seems) on the article 

* {#Scharf13} [[Günter Scharf]], _Inhomogeneous cosmology in the cosmic rest frame without dark stuff_ ([arXiv:1312.2695](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.2695))

The analogous discussion of [[quantum electrodynamics]] via [[causal perturbation theory]] is in

* [[Günter Scharf]],  _[[Finite Quantum Electrodynamics -- The Causal Approach]]_,  Springer 1995
