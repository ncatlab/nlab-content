## Idea
 {#Idea}

In full [[linear logic]] &lbrack;[Girard 1987](#Girard1987)&rbrack; and more generally in [[linear type theory]] there is assumed a (comonadic) [[modality]] traditionally denoted "!" whose role is to model the "underlying" classical [[intuitionistic type theory|(intuitionistic) type]] of a given [[linear type]]. 

This is alternatively called the "exponential modality" (for good reasons discussed [below](#TheExponentialCondition)), or "storage modality" (as it allows to duplicate and hence "store" otherwise linear data) and sometimes pronounced "of course" (intended alongside "necessarily" and "possibly" as used in [[modal logic]]) or even "bang" (just in reference to the symbol "!").

In classical linear logic (meaning with involutive [[de Morgan duality]]), the de Morgan dual of "!" is denoted "?" and then sometimes pronounced "why not".

Today it is understood (cf. [Melliès 2009](#Melliès09), [p. 36](/nlab/files/Mellies-CategoricalSemanticsLinear.pdf#page=36))
that the exponential modality is best and generally to be thought as as, first of all a *[[comonad]]* on [[linear types]] ([Seely 1989  §2](#Seely89), [dePaiva 1989](#dePaiva89), [Benton, Bierman, de Paiva and Hyland 1992](#BBPH92)) which, secondly, is [induced](monad#RelationBetweenAdjunctionsAndMonads) by an adjunction to classical (meaning here: non-linear [[intuitionistic type theory|intuitionistic]]) types with special [[monoidal functor|monoidal]] properties ([Seely 1989  §2](#Seely89), [Bierman 1994 pp. 157](#Bierman94), [Benton 1995](#Benton95)).

In a most elementary and illuminating example (which may not have received the attention it deserves, cf. the history at *[[quantum logic]]*):

* classical intuitionistic types form (are interpreted in) the category of [[Sets]]

  $ClaTypes \,\coloneqq\, Set$

* linear tupes form (are interpreted in) the category of [[vector spaces]] (cf. [Murfet 2014](linear+logic#Murfet14))

  $LinTypes  \,\coloneqq\, Vect_{\mathbb{K}}$

and the [[adjoint functors]] in question are

* forming the [[linear span]] of a set

  $$
    \array{
      Set &\overset{\mathrm{Q}}{\longrightarrow}& Vect
      \\
      W &\mapsto& \oplus_W \mathbb{1}
    }
  $$

* forming the [[underlying set]] of a [[vector space]]:

  $$
    \array{
      Vect &\overset{\mathrm{C}}{\longrightarrow}& Set
      \\
      \mathscr{V} &\mapsto& Hom(\mathbb{1}, \, \mathscr{V})
    }
  $$

in which case the exponential modality acts by sending a vector space to the linear span of its underlying set

\[
  \array{
     Vect &\overset{\;\; ! \;\;}{\longrightarrow}& Vect
     \\
     \mathscr{V} &\mapsto& \underset{\mathscr{V}}{\bigoplus} \mathbb{1}
     \,.
  }
\]

One sees that this construction takes ([[direct sums|direct]]) sums to ([[tensor product of vector spaces|tensor]]) products

$$
  !(\mathscr{V} \oplus \mathscr{V}')
  \;\simeq\;
  (! \mathscr{V}) \otimes (! \mathscr{V}')
$$

and zero ([[zero object|objects]]) to unit ([[unit object|objects]])

$$
  ! 0 
    \;\simeq\;
  \mathbb{1}
$$

as expected of any [[exponential map]], whence the name "exponential modality".

This example is the 0-sector of the more famous *[[stabilization]]* ([[(infinity,1)-adjoint functor|$\infty$-]])adjunction $(\Sigma_+^\infty \dashv \Omega_+^\infty)$  between (the [[homotopy theory]] of) [[topological spaces]] and (the [[stable homotopy theory]] of) [[module spectra|module]] [[spectra]] equipped with the [[symmetric smash product of spectra]] (given by forming [[suspension spectra]] $X \mapsto \Sigma_+^\infty X$), which points to a deeper origin of the "exponential modality", see [below](#RealizationInLinearHomotopyTypeTheory) and at *[[linear homotopy type theory]]* for more on this.

## Categorical semantics

Following [Seely 1989](#Seely89), [dePaiva 1989](#dePaiva89), [Benton, Bierman, de Paiva and Hyland 1992](#BBPH92) it is common convention that "!" should be a [[comonad]] on the type system (and ? should be a [[monad]], see also at *[[monads in computer science]]*), but there is some room in which further axioms to impose. 
The goal is to capture the syntactic rules allowing assumptions of the form $!A$ to be duplicated and discarded.

### Intuitionistic case

The definition from [Seely](#Seely89), adapted to the intuitionistic case and modernized, is:

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition
Let $LinTypes$ be 

* a [[cartesian monoidal category]], with [[Cartesian product]] "$\times$" and [[tensor unit]] the [[terminal object]] $\ast$.

which *in addition* carries the [[structure]] of 

* a [[symmetric monoidal category]] with respect to a [[tensor product]] $\otimes$ with [[tensor unit]] $\mathbb{1}$.

A **Seely comonad** on $LinTypes$ is a [[comonad]] that is a [[strong monoidal functor|strong monoidal]] as a functor from cartesian monoidal structure $\times$ to the other monoidal structure $\otimes$: 


$$
  (LinTypes, \times)
  \xrightarrow{ \; ! \; }
  (LinTypes, \otimes)
$$

meaning that there are [[natural transformations]] of the form

\[
  \label{StrongMonoidalPropertyOfExponential}
  A,\, B \colon LinTypes
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \vdash
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  !(A \times B) 
   \;\cong\; 
  (!A) \otimes (!B) 
\] 

and

\[
  ! \ast \;\;\simeq\;\; \mathbb{1}
  \,.
\]

=--

(There is also an additional [[coherence]] [[axiom]] that should be imposed; see [Melliès 2009, section 7.3](#Melliès09).)


\begin{remark}\label{TheExponentialCondition}
**(the exponential condition)**
\linebreak
In [[linear logic]], the cartesian monoidal structure on linear types is often denoted "$\&$" ("[[additive conjunction]]"), in which case the condition (eq:StrongMonoidalPropertyOfExponential) reads

\[
  !(A \& B) 
   \;\cong\; 
  (!A) \otimes (!B) 
  \,.
\] 

But in key examples of categories of (the multiplicative fragment of) linear logic (such as [[Vect]], cf. [Murfet 2014](linear+logic#Murfet14)), the [[cartesian product]] is actually a [[biproduct]], hence a [[direct sum]], in which case the condition on the exponential modality is that 

*it takes (direct) sums to (tensor) products*

\[
  !(A \oplus B) 
   \;\cong\; 
  (!A) \otimes (!B) 
\] 

*it takes zero (objects) to unit (objects)*

\[
  ! 0 
    \;\cong\;
  \mathbb{1}
\]

as befits any [[exponential map]] and may explain the choice of terminology here.
\end{remark}


This condition implies that the [[Kleisli category of a comonad|Kleisli category]] of $!$ (i.e. the category of cofree !-coalgebras) is cartesian monoidal.  If $LinTypes$ is *[[closed monoidal category|closed]]* symmetric monoidal then the Kleisli category of a [[cartesian closed category]], which is a categorical version of the translation of intuitionistic logic into linear logic.

Of course, the above definition depends on the existence of the cartesian product.  A different definition that doesn't require the existence of $\times$ was given by [Benton, Bierman, de Paiva, and Hyland](#BBPH92):

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Let $LinTypes$ be a [[symmetric monoidal category]]; a **linear exponential comonad** on $LinTypes$ is a [[lax monoidal functor|lax monoidal]] comonad such that every cofree !-coalgebra naturally carries the structure of a [[comonoid object]] in the category of coalgebras (i.e. the cofree-coalgebra functor lifts to the category of comonoids in the category of coalgebras).

=--

It follows automatically that all !-coalgebras are comonoids, and therefore that the category of all !-coalgebras (not just the cofree ones) is cartesian monoidal.  Note that for a comonad on a [[poset]], every coalgebra is free; thus the world of pure propositional "logic" doesn't tell us whether to consider the Kleisli category or the Eilenberg-Moore category for the translation.

A more even-handed approach is the following (see [Benton (1995)](#Benton95) and [Melliès (2009)](#Melliès09)), based on the observation that both Kleisli and Eilenberg-Moore categories are instances of adjunctions.

\begin{definition}
\label{LinearNonlinearAdjunction}

A **linear-nonlinear adjunction** is a [[monoidal adjunction]] $F \colon ClaTypes \rightleftarrows LinTypes \colon G$ in which $LinTypes$ is symmetric monoidal and $ClaTypes$ is cartesian monoidal.  The induced !-modality is the induced [[comonad]] $F G$ on $LinTypes$.

\end{definition}


This includes both of the previous definitions where $M$ is taken respectively to be the Kleisli category or the Eilenberg-Moore category of !.  Conversely, in any linear-nonlinear adjunction the induced comonad $F G$ can be shown to be a linear exponential comonad.  Moreover, if $!$ is a linear exponential comonad on a symmetric monoidal category $LinTypes$ with finite products, then the cofree !-coalgebra functor is a right adjoint and hence preserves cartesian products; but the cartesian products of coalgebras are the tensor products in $C$, so we have $!(A\times B) \cong !A \otimes !B$, the Seely condition.


### Classical case

For "classical" linear logic, we want $LinTypes$ to be not just (closed) symmetric monoidal but $\ast$-[[star-autonomous category|autonomous]].  If an $\ast$-autonomous category has a linear exponential comonad $!$ one can derive a ? from the ! by [[de Morgan duality]], $?A = \big(!(A^*)\big)^*$.  The resulting relationship between ! and ? was axiomatized in a way not requiring the de Morgan duality by [Blute, Cockett & Seely (1996)](#BluteCockettSeely96):

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition
Let $LinTypes$ be a [[linearly distributive category]] with tensor product $\otimes$ and cotensor product $\parr$.  A (!,?)-modality on $LinTypes$ consists of:

1. a $\otimes$-monoidal comonad ! and a $\parr$-comonoidal monad ?

1. ? is a !-strong monad, and ! is a ?-strong comonad

1. all free !-coalgebras are naturally commutative $\otimes$-comonoids, and all free ?-algebras are naturally commutative $\parr$-monoids.

=--

Here a functor $F$ is [[strong functor|strong]] with respect to a [[lax monoidal functor]] $G$ if there is a [[natural transformation]] of the form $F A \otimes G B \to F(A\otimes G B)$ satisfying some natural axioms, and we similarly require compatibility of the monad and comonad structure transformations.  [BCS96](#BluteCockettSeely96) showed that if $LinTypes$ is in fact $\ast$-autonomous, it follows from the above definition that $?A = \big(!(A^*)\big)^*$, as expected.

## Examples

### Relation to Chu construction

\begin{theorem}
Suppose $F \colon M \rightleftarrows C : G$ is a linear-nonlinear adjunction (Def. \ref{LinearNonlinearAdjunction}), where $C$ is closed symmetric monoidal with finite limits and colimits, and $\bot\in C$ is an object.  Then there is an induced linear-nonlinear adjunction $M \rightleftarrows Chu(C,\bot)$ where $Chu(C,\bot)$ is the [[Chu construction]] $Chu(C,\bot)$, which is $\ast$-autonomous with finite limits and colimits.  Hence $Chu(C,\bot)$ admits a !-modality.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
The embedding of $C$ in $Chu(C,\bot)$ as $A \mapsto (A, [A,\bot], ev)$ is coreflective: the coreflection of $(B^+, B^-, e_B)$ is $(B^+, [B^+,\bot], ev)$.  Moreover, this subcategory is closed under the tensor product of $Chu(C,\bot)$, i.e. the embedding $C\hookrightarrow Chu(C,\bot)$ is strong monoidal, hence the adjunction is a monoidal adjunction.  Therefore, the composite adjunction $M \rightleftarrows C \rightleftarrows Chu(C,\bot)$ is again a linear-nonlinear-adjunction.
\end{proof}

Note that this theorem is a direct consequence of the work of [[Yves Lafont]] and [[Thomas Streicher]] on game semantics using the Chu construction, together with Benton's reformulation of linear logic in terms of  monoidal adjunctions. Since a Chu construction is $\ast$-autonomous, this !-modality implies a dual ?-modality.

\begin{corollary}
If $C$ is a cartesian closed category with finite limits and colimits and $\bot\in C$ is an object, then there is a linear-nonlinear adjunction $C \rightleftarrows Chu(C,\bot)$, and hence $Chu(C,\bot)$ admits a !-modality.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
Apply the previous theorem to the identity adjunction $C\rightleftarrows C$.
\end{proof}

Note that the !-modality obtained from the corollary is [[idempotent comonad|idempotent]], while that obtained from the theorem is idempotent if and only if the original one was.  Other ways of constructing !-modalities, such as by cofree coalgebras, may produce examples that are not idempotent.

### Realization in linear homotopy type theory
 {#RealizationInLinearHomotopyTypeTheory}

In [[dependent linear homotopy type theory]] the "linear-nonlinear adjunction" is naturally identified ([Ponto & Shulman (2012), Ex. 4.2](#PontoShulman12), see also [Schreiber (2014), Sec. 4.2](#Schreiber14)) with the [[stabilization]] [[adjoint functor|adjunction]] between [[homotopy types]] and [[stable homotopy types]] ([Riley (2022), Prop. 2.1.31](#Riley22Thesis)), whose [[left adjoint]] (forming [[suspension spectra]] $\Sigma^\infty_+$) is equivalently given (cf. [Riley (2022), Rem. 2.4.13](#Riley22Thesis)) by sending $B \,\colon\, Type$ to the linear [[dependent sum]] $\star_B \mathbb{1} \;\coloneqq\; (p_B)_! (p_B)^\ast \mathbb{1}$ over the monoidal unit in the context $B$. In terms of [quantum modal logic](necessity+and+possibility#ModalQuantumLogic) this is forming the "linear randomization" of the given classical homotopy type (its "[[motive]]"): 

\[
  \label{MotivizationInLHott}
\]

\begin{imagefromfile}
    "file_name": "MotivizationInLHoTT-230825b.jpg",
    "width": "460",
    "unit": "px",
    "margin": {
        "top": -20,
        "bottom": 20,
        "right": 0, 
        "left": 10
    }
\end{imagefromfile}


Curiously, this homotopy-theoretic realization of the exponential modality (beware the little subtlety of whether or not to reflect onto [[pointed homotopy types]])

$$
  \Sigma^\infty \circ \Omega^\infty
  \;\colon\;
  Spectra \to Spectra
$$

has independently been argued to have properties of an [[exponential map]] in the context of [[Goodwillie calculus]], see [there](Goodwillie+calculus#GoodwillieDerivativeOfExponentialModality).

{#ComonadicityOfClassicalOverLinearHomotopyTypes} Moreover $\Sigma^\infty \dashv \Omega^\infty$ is a [[comonadic adjunction]] on [[simply connected homotopy type|simply connected]] [[homotopy types]] &lbrack;[Blomquist & Harper 2016  Thm. 1.8](#BlomquistHarper16); [Hess & Kedziorek 2017 Thm. 3.11](#HessKedziorek17)&rbrack;, meaning that simply-connected classical (but [[pointed homotopy types|pointed]]) homotopy types are identified with the $\Sigma^\infty \Omega^\infty$-[[modales]] among [[stable homotopy types]].


## Modal term calculi

Girard's original presentation of linear logic involved rules that explicitly assumed the presence of $!$ on hypotheses or on entire contexts, such as [[dereliction rule| dereliction]], [[weakening rule|weakening]] and [[contraction rule|contraction]]:

$$\frac{\Gamma, A \vdash B}{\Gamma, !A \vdash B} \qquad \frac{\Gamma \vdash B}{\Gamma, !A\vdash B} \qquad \frac{\Gamma,!A,!A \vdash B}{\Gamma, !A\vdash B}$$

and "promotion":

$$ \frac{!\Gamma \vdash A}{!\Gamma\vdash !A} $$

If this is translated into a [[natural deduction]] style term calculus, the resulting rules are more complicated than those of most type formers.  This can be avoided using [[adjoint type theory]] with two context zones, one "nonlinear" one where contraction and weakening are permitted (and [[admissible rule|admissible]]) and one "linear" one where they are not, with $!$ as a modality relating the two zones.

Such a "modal" presentation of linear logic was first introduced by [Girard 1993](#Girard93) and then developed by [Plotkin 1993](#Plotkin93), [Wadler 1993](#Wadler93), [Benton 1995](#Benton95), [Barber 1996](#Barber96).

This presentation also generalizes naturally to [[dependent linear type theory]], with the nonlinear type theory being dependent, and the linear types depending on the nonlinear ones but nothing depending on linear types.  In this context, the $!$-modality decomposes into "context extension" and a "dependent sum".
