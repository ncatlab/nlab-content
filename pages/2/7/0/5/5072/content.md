## Idea

The notion of _polytopes_ is the generalization of the notion of [[polygons]] to arbitrary [[dimensions]]:

* a convex 0-polytope is the [[point]],

* a convex 1-polytope is the [[interval]],

* a convex 2-polytope is a [[polygon]],

* a convex 3-polytope is a *polyhedron*

  (beware the difference to *[[polyhedral space]]* in [[algebraic topology]]).
