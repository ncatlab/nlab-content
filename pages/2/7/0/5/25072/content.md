## Idea

Generally, in [[gauge theory]] by a *flux tube* one means a cylindrical/string-shaped region inside which a given kind [[flux]] is concentrated. For example 

* [[magnetic flux]] through a long [[solenoid]] carrying electric [[current]] (this is represented by the "flux lines" originally introduced by [[Michael Faraday]]);

* similarly: [magnetic flux tubes inside a superconductor](flux#MagneticFluxQuantizationInTypeIISuperconductors)

* "[[color charge|color]]" flux tubes between [[quarks]] in [[quantum chromodynamics]] (also: "[[Wilson lines]]")

  (which become the [[strings]] of [[string theory]] under [[AdS-CFT correspondence]]/[[AdS-QCD correspondence]])

## Related concepts

* [[flux]], [[flux quantization]], [[flux compactification]], [[uncertainty of fluxes]]

* the [[AdS-QCD correspondence]] postulates that [[QCD]]-flux tubes, once properly [[quantization|quanitized]], behave like  [[open strings]] propagating in a higher-dimensional [[spacetime]], whose endpoints (the [[quarks]]) are constrained to a 3+1-dimensional [[intersecting brane model|brane intersection]]

* [[large N limit]]
