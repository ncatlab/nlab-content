## Definition

A **finite limit** is a [[limit]] over a [[diagram]] that is a [[finite category]].

More generally, in [[higher category theory]], a finite limit is a [[limit]] of a diagram that is a finite [[(n,r)-category]].


## Related concepts

A [[category]] that has all finite limits is called a [[finitely complete category]].

A [[functor]] that preserves finite limits is a left [[exact functor]], or simply a _lex_ functor (or a _cartesian_ functor, or a _finitely continuous_ functor).
