The Max-plus algebra is based on the set of real numbers extended by $-\infty$, with addition $x\oplus y = max(x,y)$  and multiplication $x\otimes y = x+y$.

It is an [[idempotent semiring]]/ [[dioid]] that is used in the modelling of timed systems.  Typically in a simple example, the completion time of a production system will be given by a system of equations that have 'max' occurring in them. (The next process in a system cannot start until all its component parts have been themselves completed.) The use of the max-plus notation completely linearises many systems.
