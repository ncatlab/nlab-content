## Idea

The generalization to the context of [[(∞,1)-category]]-theory of the notion of a [[full and faithful functor]] in ordinary [[category theory]].


## Definition

An [[(∞,1)-functor]] $F : C \to D$ is **full and faithful** if for all objects $x,y \in C$  it induces an equivalence on the [[hom-object in a quasi-category|hom-∞-groupoids]]

$$
  F_{x,y} : Hom_C(x,y) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
   Hom_D(F(x), F(y))
  \,.
$$

A full and faithful $(\infty,1)$-functor $F : C \to D$ exhibits $C$ as a [[full sub-(∞,1)-category]] of $D$ and one tends to write

$$
  F : C \hookrightarrow D
$$

to indicate this.


## Properties

Every full and faithful $(\infty,1)$-functor is a [[monomorphism in an (∞,1)-category|monomorphism]] in [[(∞,1)Cat]], but being a full and faithful $(\infty,1)$-functor is a stronger condition. An $(\infty,1)$-functor $F$ is a monomorphism if and only if it induces a [[monomorphism in an (∞,1)-category|monomorphism]] on $\mathrm{Hom}$-spaces and every equivalence $FX \simeq FY$ is in the effective image of $F$ (see [this MathOverflow question](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/345686/monomorphisms-in-mathcalc-at-infty/345700)).

An [[(∞,1)-functor]] which is both full and faithful as well as an [[essentially surjective (∞,1)-functor]] is an [[equivalence of (∞,1)-categories]].
