## Definition

A [[category]] is __bicartesian__ if it is both cartesian and cocartesian, that is if both it and its [[opposite category|opposite]] may be made into [[cartesian monoidal categories]].
Note this is different than a [[semiadditive category]], i.e. a category with *coinciding* products and coproducts. Thus every semiadditive category is bicartesian, but not every bicartesian category is semiadditive.

A bicartesian category which is also [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]] is a __[[bicartesian closed category]]__. Bicartesian closed categories are usually *not* [[cocartesian closed category|cocartesian closed]].
