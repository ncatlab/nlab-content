Barry Mitchell (1933-2021) was an American mathematician who wrote one of the earliest books on category theory (1965).  He proved what is sometimes called the [Mitchell embedding theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell%27s_embedding_theorem) also called the *Freyd-Mitchell embedding theorem*, which shows that any [[abelian category]] has an exact embedding into a module category.
