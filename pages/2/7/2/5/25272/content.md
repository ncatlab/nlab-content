A __dyadic compactum__ is an image under a continuous map of some cartesian (that is [[product topology|Tihonov]]) product $2^K$ of discrete 2-point topological spaces. A __dyadic space__ is a topological space which is homeomorphic to a dense subspace of a dyadic compactum. The basic example is the [[Cantor set]] $2^\omega$.
