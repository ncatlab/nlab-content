## Idea

A *dyadic compactum* is the [[image]] under a [[continuous map]] of some cartesian (that is [[product topology|Tihonov]]) [[product topological space|product]] $2^K$ of [[discrete topological space|discrete]] 2-point topological spaces. 

A *dyadic space* is a [[topological space]] which is [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to a [[dense subspace]] of a dyadic compactum. 

The basic example is the [[Cantor set]] $2^\omega$.
