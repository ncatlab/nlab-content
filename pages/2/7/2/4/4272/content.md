## Idea ##
Fell's theorem is about a property of vector [[states]] of a [[C-star algebra]], it says that if the kernels of two representations of the algebra coincide, then the vector [[states]] are mutually weak-* dense. This has a profound consequence for the [[AQFT]] interpretation: A state represents the physical state of a physical system. Since one can always only perform a finite number of measurements, with a finite precision, it is only possible to determine a weak-* neigborhood of a given state. This means that it is not possible - not even in principle - to distinguish representations with coinciding kernels by measurements. 

For this reason representations with coinciding kernels are sometimes called **physically equivalent** in the [[AQFT]] literature.


## Properties ##
Let A be a unital $C^*-$algebra and $\pi_1, \pi_2$ be two representations of A on a [[Hilbert space]] H.

###### Theorem
**equivalence theorem**
Every vector state of $\pi_1$ is the weak-* limit of vector states of $\pi_2$ iff the kernel of $\pi_1$ contains the kernel of $\pi_2$.
