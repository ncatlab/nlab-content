_Algebraic Quantum Field Theory_ or _Axiomatic Quantum Field Theory_.

#Idea#

AQFT axiomatises the _Heisenberg picture_ of [[quantum field theory]] as [[FQFT]] axiomatizes the _Schr&#246;dinger picture_.

The assignment of an _algebra of observables_ to a region of spacetime by a quantum field theory is formalized 
as a co-flabby co-[[presheaf]] of [[algebra|algebras]] on spacetime which satisfies a certain _locality_ axiom with respect to the Lorentzian structure of spacetime: 

* locality: algebras assigned to spacelike separated regions commute with each other when embedded into any joint superalgebra.

Such a local co-flabby co-presheaf of algebra is called a _local net_.
