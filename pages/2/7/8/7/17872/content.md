The 2-[[periodic ring spectrum]]-version of [[Morava K-theory]].

Let $C$ be any [[elliptic curve]] over the [[prime field]] $\mathbb{F}_p$.  This will have a [[formal group]] of either [[height of a formal group law|height]] $h=1$ ("ordinary curve") or height $h=2$ ("[[supersingular elliptic curve]]").  For any such $C$, there is a [[ring spectrum]] $K_C$ with coefficient ring $\pi_* K_C=\mathbb{F}_p[u,u^{-1}]$, with $u\in \pi_2$, which is [[complex orientable cohomology theory|complex orientable]], whose formal group is the formal group of $C$. This $K_C$ is the "2-periodic Morava $K$-theory" associated to the formal group.
