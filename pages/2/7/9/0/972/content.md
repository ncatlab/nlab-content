A **complete lattice** is a [[partial order|poset]] which has all [[join|joins]] and [[meet|meets]].  In particular, it is a [[lattice]].  By the [[adjoint functor theorem]] for posets, having either all joins or all meets is sufficient for the other.  However, a [[suplattice]] morphism may preserve only joins, while dually an [[inflattice]] morphism may preserve only meets.

# Examples
* Any [[power set]];
* The ordered set of [[real number]]s, if a [[top]] element $\infty$ and a [[bottom]] element $-\infty$ are added;
* Any finite [[toset]];
* The [[unit interval]] $[0,1]$.

Of these example, only power sets are complete [[constructive mathematics|constructively]].
