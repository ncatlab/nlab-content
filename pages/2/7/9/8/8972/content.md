The book

* [[Robert Harper]]

  **Practical Foundations for Programming Languages**

  Cambridge University Press (2016)

  [ISBN:9781107150300](http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/computer-science/programming-languages-and-applied-logic/practical-foundations-programming-languages-2nd-edition?format=HB)

  [pdf](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/pfpl/2nded.pdf)

lays the foundations of the theory of [[programming languages]] in terms of [[type theory]].
In over 500 pages, the author formally specifies and step-by-step extends established [[type systems]] and reasons about type safety and [[operational semantics]] (not so much about [[dependent types]] and [[categorical semantics]]). The book also contains a discussion of [[formal logic]] in type theory and features of variants of the `Algol` [[programming language]], in particular.

> &lbrack;p. xvii:&rbrack; Types are the central organizing principle of the theory of programming languages. Language features are manifestations of type structure. The syntax of a language is governed by the constructs that define its types, and its semantics is determined by the interactions among those constructs. The soundness of a language design—the absence of ill-defined programs—follows naturally. The purpose of this book is to explain this remark.
