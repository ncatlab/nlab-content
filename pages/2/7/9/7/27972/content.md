## Idea 


In a $1$-Category compositions are by definition unique, however in a simplicial set a good notion of composition between 1-simplices might not exist which leads to the idea of a composer. One idea is to formalize the notion of composition between $n$-simplices or "$n$-morphisms" in general.

## Definition


A composer $C$ is a simplicial set with the extension property with respect to all [[Spline]] inclusions $I^n \to \Delta^n$. In particular since $I^2=\Lambda^2[1]$ and two composable $1$-simplices $f,g$ determines a $I^2$ then this means that we can define the composition $g \circ f$ as the restriction of the extension of the spline $\sigma|_{0,2}$.
