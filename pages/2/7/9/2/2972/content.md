## Idea

Together with the field of [[gravity]] and the [[Kalb-Ramond field]], the _dilaton field_ is one of the three massless bosonic fields that appears in effective background [[quantum field theory|quantum field theories]] of [[string theory]].


## Global cohomological description

The global nature of the gravitational field and the Kalb-ramond field are well understood conceptually: the gravitational field is a [[pseudo-Riemannian metric]] and the Kalb-Ramond field is a cocycle in third integral [[differential cohomology]] (for instance realized by a cocycle in [[Deligne cohomology]] or by a [[bundle gerbe]] with connection). 

In [[generalized complex geometry]] both these fields are shown to be unified as one single [[schreiber:∞-Lie algebroid valued differential forms|∞-Lie algebroid valued]] form field: a connection on a [[standard Courant algebroid]] (as described in more detail there). 

While it was clear that the diaton field is locally just a real-valued function, is formal global identification has not been understood in an analogous manner for a long time.

But a proposal for a precise conceptual identification of the dilaton as a structure appearing in the context of [[generalized complex geometry]] is in
