## Definition

Any [[group]] $G$ has a [[category]] of finite-dimensional [[complex number|complex]]-linear [[representations]], often denoted $Rep(G)$.  This is a [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal]] [[abelian category]] (a "[[tensor category]]") and thus has a [[Grothendieck ring]], which is called the **representation ring** of $G$ and denoted $R(G)$. Elements of the representation ring are hence formal differences (with respect to [[direct sum]]) of ordinary representations: [[virtual representations]].

### In components

More concretely, we get $R(G)$ as follows.  It has a [[basis]] $(e_i)_i$ given by the [[isomorphism classes]] of **[[irreducible representations]]** of $G$: that is, $i$ is an index for an irreducible finite-dimensional complex representation of $G$.  It has a product given by 

$$ e_i e_j = \sum_k m_{i j}^k e_k ,$$

where $m_{i j}^k$ is the multiplicity of the $k$th irrep in the 
[[tensor product of representations]] of the $i$th and $j$th irreps.  

In [[physics]] these coefficients are also known as _[[Clebsch-Gordan coefficients]]_ (specifically for $G$ the [[special orthogonal group]] $SO(3)$), and the relations they satisfy are also known as _[[Fierz identities]]_ (specifically for $G$ a [[spin group]]).

Notice that $R(G)$ is commutative thanks to the [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetry]] of the tensor product.


### As equivariant K-theory of the point
 {#AsEquivariantKTheoryOfThePoint}

Equivalently the representation ring of $G$ over the [[complex numbers]] is the $G$-[[equivariant K-theory]] of the point, or equivalently by the [[Green-Julg theorem]], if $G$ is a [[compact Lie group]], the [[operator K-theory]] of the [[group algebra]] (the [[groupoid convolution algebra]] of the [[delooping]] groupoid of $G$):

$$
  R_{\mathbb{C}}(G) \simeq KU^0_G(\ast) \simeq KK(\mathbb{C}, C(\mathbf{B}G))
  \,.
$$

The first [[isomorphism]] here follows immediately from the elementary definition of equivariant [[topological K-theory]], since a $G$-[[equivariant vector bundle]] over the point is manifestly just a [[linear representation]] of $G$ on a [[complex vector space]].

(e.g. [Greenlees 05, section 3](#Greenlees05), [Wilson 16, example 1.6 p. 3](#Wilson16))

Therefore a similar isomorphism identifies the $G$-representation ring over the [[real numbers]] with the equivariant orthogonal $K$-theory of the point in degree 0:

$$
  R_{\mathbb{R}}(G)
  \;\simeq\;
  KO_G^0(\ast)
  \,.
$$

But beware that equivariant [[KO]], even of the point, is much richer in higher degree ([Wilson 16, remark 3.34](#Wilson16))

In fact, [[equivariant KO-theory]] of the point subsumes the [[representation rings]] over the [[real numbers]], the [[complex numbers]] and the [[quaternions]]:

$$
  KO_G^n(\ast)
  \;\simeq\;
  \left\{
  \array{
    0 &\vert& n = 7
    \\
    R_{\mathbb{H}}(G)/ R_{\mathbb{R}}(G) &\vert& n = 6
    \\
    R_{\mathbb{H}}(G)/ R_{\mathbb{C}}(G) &\vert& n = 5
    \\
    R_{\mathbb{H}}(G) \phantom{/ R_{\mathbb{R}}(G) }  &\vert& n = 4
    \\
    0 &\vert& n = 3
    \\
    R_{\mathbb{C}}(G)/ R_{\mathbb{H}}(G) &\vert& n = 2
    \\
    R_{\mathbb{R}}(G)/ R_{\mathbb{C}}(G) &\vert& n = 1
    \\
    R_{\mathbb{R}}(G) \phantom{/ R_{\mathbb{R}}(G)} &\vert& n =0
  }
  \right.
$$

## Properties

### Relation to the character ring

If $G$ is a [[finite group]] and we [[tensor product of modules|tensor]] $R(G)$ with the [[complex numbers]], it becomes [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the **[[character ring]]** of $G$: that is, the ring of complex-valued functions on $G$ that are constant on each [[conjugacy class]].  Such functions are called **[[class functions]]**.

Similarly for $G$ a [[compact Lie group]], its complex linear [[representations]] $\rho \colon G \to U(n) \to Aut(\mathbb{C}^n)$ (for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$) are uniquely specified by their [[characters]] $\chi_\rho \coloneqq tr(\rho(-)) \colon G \to \mathbb{C}$. Therefore also here the representation ring is often called the _character ring_ of the group.
 
### Relation to Schur's lemma

The ([[isomorphism classes]]) of [[finite-dimensional vector space|finite-dimensional]] [[irreducible representations]] $V_i$ form the canonical $\mathbb{Z}$-[[linear basis]] of the representation ring:

$$
  R(G) \;\simeq\; \mathbb{Z}\big[  \{V_i\}_i \big]
  \,.
$$

Moreover, the [[function]] assigning [[dimensions]] of [[hom-object|hom]]-[[vector spaces]] constitutes a canonical bilinear symmetric [[inner product]]:

$$
  \langle -,-\rangle
  \;\colon\;
  R(G) \times R(G)
    \longrightarrow
  \mathbb{Z}
  \,.
$$

In terms of this, _[[Schur's lemma]]_ states that the [[irreducible representations]] generally constitute an _[[orthogonal basis]]_, and even an _[[orthonormal basis]]_ when the [[ground field]] is [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]].

For more discussion of this perspective, see 

* at _[[Schur's lemma]]_ the section _[In terms of categorical algebra](Schur's+lemma#InterpretationInCategoricalAlgebra)_;

* at _[[Gram-Schmidt process]]_ the section _[Categorified Gram-Schmidt  process](Gram-Schmidt+process#CategorifiedGramSchmidtProcess)_.


### Relation to equivariant K-theory

The representation ring of a [[compact Lie group]] is equivalent to the $G$-[[equivariant K-theory]] of the point.

$$
  Rep(G) \simeq K_G(\ast)
  \,.
$$

The construction of representations by [[index]]-constructions of $G$-equivariant [[Dirac operators]] ([[push-forward in generalized cohomology|push-forward]] in $G$-[[equivariant K-theory]] to the point) is called _[[Dirac induction]]_.

[[!include Segal completion -- table]]


### Lambda-ring structure
 {#LambdaRingStructure}

The [[Adams operations]] equip the representation ring with the structure of a [[Lambda ring]],. (e.g. [tomDieck 79, section 3.5](#tomDieck79), [tom Dieck 09, section 6.2](#tomDieck09), [Meir 17](#Meir17)).

### Relation to the Burnside ring

Let $G$ be a [[finite group]]. Consider

1. the [[Burnside ring]] $A(G)$, which is the [[Grothendieck group]] of the [[monoidal category]] $G Set$ of [[finite set|finite]] [[G-sets]];

1. the [[representation ring]] $R(G)$, which is the [[Grothendieck group]] of the monoidal category $G Rep$ of [[finite dimensional vector space|finite dimensional]] $G$-[[linear representations]].

Then then map that sends a G-set to the corresponding linear [[permutation representation]] is a [[strong monoidal functor]]

$$
  G Set \overset{\mathbb{C}[-]}{\longrightarrow} G Rep
$$

and hence induces a [[ring homomorphism]]

$$
  A(G) \overset{ \mathbb{C}[-] }{\longrightarrow} R(G)
$$

Under the identitification

1. of the [[Burnside ring]] with the [[equivariant stable cohomotopy]] of the point 

   $$
     A(G) \;\simeq\; \mathbb{S}_G(\ast)
   $$

   (see [there](Burnside+ring#AsTheEquivariantStableCohomotopyOfThePoint))

1. of the [[representation ring]] with the [[equivariant K-theory]] of the point

   $$
     R(G) \;\simeq\; K_G(\ast)
   $$

   (as [above](#AsEquivariantKTheoryOfThePoint))

this should be image of the initial morphism of [[E-infinity ring spectra]]

$$
  \mathbb{S} \longrightarrow KU
$$

from the [[sphere spectrum]] to [[KU]].


### Splitting principle and Brauer induction theorem

The [[Brauer induction theorem]] says that, over the [[complex numbers]], the representation ring is generated already from the [[induced representations]] of 1-dimensional representations. This may be regarded as the [[splitting principle]] for linear representations and for [[characteristic classes of linear representations]] ([Symonds 91](#Symonds91)).


## Examples

\begin{example}\label{RepresentationRingOfUnitaryGroups}
**([[representation ring]] of [[unitary groups]])**
For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the complex representation ring of [[U(n)]] is 

$$
  R_{\mathbb{C}}
  \big(
    U(n)
  \big)
  \;\simeq\;
  \mathbb{Z}[x_1, \cdots, x_{n-1}, x_n, x_n^{-1}]
  \,,
$$

and that of [[SU(n)]] is 

$$
  R_{\mathbb{C}}
  \big(
    SU(n)
  \big)
  \;\simeq\;
  \mathbb{Z}[x_1, \cdots, x_{n-1}]
  \,.
$$
\end{example}

(e.g. [Husemöller 66, Ch. 14, Thm. 3.1 (p. 192)](#Husemoeller66))

* The completion of $Rep(Spin(2k))$ is $\mathbb{Z}[ [ e^{\pm x_j} ] ]$ for $1 \leq j \leq k$ (e.g [Brylinski 90, p. 9](#Brylinski90)).
