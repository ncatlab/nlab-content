"It is an involution on the derived category of an abelian variety, and can be used to describe all vector bundles on an elliptic curve (maybe also an AV). F-M can be used to prove the Torelli theorem."

A great reference appears to be Bartocci et al (PIM276), in Geometry-Various folder.

from arXiv Front: math.AG by Alberto Canonaco, Paolo Stellari
This paper surveys some recent results about Fourier-Mukai functors. In
particular, given an exact functor between the bounded derived categories of
coherent sheaves on two smooth projective varieties, we deal with the question
whether this functor is of Fourier-Mukai type. Several related questions are
answered and many open problems are stated.

The Fourier-Mukai transform is mentioned in the introduction to the March 2012 Palo Alto workshop on integral cohomology and Chow groups.
