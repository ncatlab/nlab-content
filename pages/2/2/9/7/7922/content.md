## Idea

The left [[derived functor]] of a [[tensor product]] [[functor]]. In the context of [[triangulated categories]] denoted by $\stackrel{\mathbf{L}}\otimes$ or $\otimes^L$. In the context of classical [[homological algebra]] its components (the classical left derived functors) are traditionally denoted by _[[Tor]]${}_{i}$_.


## Examples

* [[Tor]]

* [[symmetric monoidal smash product of spectra]]
