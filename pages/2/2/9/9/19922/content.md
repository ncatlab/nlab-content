## Idea 

In [[proof theory]], **primitive recursive arithmetic**, or **PRA**, is a [[finitist mathematics|finitist]], [[quantifier]]-free formalization of the [[natural numbers]].

**PRA** can express arithmetic propositions involving natural numbers and any [[primitive recursive function]], including the operations of addition, multiplication, and exponentiation. 

## As a Skolem theory 

Let $T$ be a [[Lawvere theory]], i.e., a category with finite products $T$ equipped with a bijective-on-objects product-preserving functor $X: Fin^{op} \to T$ where $Fin$ is the category of finite [[cardinals]] and functions. Recall that a [[Skolem theory]] is a Lawvere theory $(T, X: Fin^{op} \to T)$ in which $N = X(1)$ carries a structure of parametrized [[natural numbers object]] in $T$. 

Abstractly, PRA can be described as the initial Skolem theory. Precise statements to this effect are difficult to pin down in the literature. (More later)
