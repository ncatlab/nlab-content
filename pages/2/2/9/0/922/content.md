Let $(C,d_C)$ be a dg-coalgebra with comultiplication $\Delta$ and $(A,d_A)$ a dg-algebra with multiplication $\mu$. A twisting cochain is a morphism $\tau:C\to A$ of degree $-1$ such that the following [[ Maurer-Cartan equation
| Maurer-Cartan equation]] holds:
$$d_A\circ\tau+\tau\circ d_C+\mu\circ(\tau\otimes\tau)\circ\Delta = 0.$$
Twisting cochain is a datum used to define the [[twisted tensor product| twisted tensor product]] $L\otimes_\tau M$ for any right $C$-comodule $L$ and any left $A$-comodule $M$,
as well as the [[twisted module of homomorphisms|twisted module of homomorphisms]] $\mathrm{Hom}_\tau(N,P)$ where $N$ is a left $C$-dg-comodule and $P$ a left $A$-dg-module.

There are variants of the notion of twisting cochain in a variety of other contexts.
