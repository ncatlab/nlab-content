\section{Introduction}

A _permutation group_ is, roughly speaking, a [[set]] of [[permutations]] which is closed under composition and which includes the identity permutation. Permutation groups are of historical significance: they were the first groups to be studied. 

By [[Cayley's theorem]], all groups are in fact isomorphic to permutation groups.

\section{Formal definition and examples}

To give a formal definition of a permutation group, we make use of the [[symmetric group]].

\begin{defn} Let $X$ be a finite set. A _permutation group_ on $X$ is a subgroup of the symmetric group on $X$. \end{defn} 

\begin{example} The [[alternating group]] on a finite set $X$ is a permutation group on $X$. \end{example}

\begin{example} The group of [[rotation permutations]] of $X$ is a permutation group on $X$. \end{example}
