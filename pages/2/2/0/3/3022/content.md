A __$1$-topos__, or __$(1,1)$-topos__, is simply a [[topos]], thought of as a special case of an $(\infty,1)$-[[(infinity,1)-topos|topos]] or even as a special case of an $\infty$-[[infinity-topos|topos]].  Compare that a [[0-topos]] is a [[Heyting algebra]].

Similarly, a __Grothendeick $1$-topos__, or __Grothendieck $(1,1)$-topos__, is simply a [[Grothendieck topos]].  Compare that a [[Grothendieck 0-topos]] is a [[frame]] (or [[locale]]).
