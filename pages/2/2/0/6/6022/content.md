## Idea

A _Euclidean quantum field theory_ is a [[quantum field theory]] given, as an [[FQFT]], by a [[functor]] on a [[category of cobordisms]] that are equipped with [[Riemannian structure]].

This is in contrast to the phenomenologically more realistic case where the cobordisms are equipped with [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo-Riemannian structure]] and thus can be thought of as pieces of [[spacetime]].

It is also in contrast to the case where the cobordisms are equipped with no extra structure, which is the case of [[topological quantum field theory]].
