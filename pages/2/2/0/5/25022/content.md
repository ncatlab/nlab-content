## Definition

In the natural numbers, a **prime power** $p^n$ is a positive power $n \geq 1$ of a [[prime number]] $p$.

##Â Properties

The [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]] states that every positive natural number is a finite product of prime powers. 

## Uses in other parts of mathematics

In [[group theory]], a group is a [[p-primary group]] if its order is a [[prime power]] of the given [[prime number]] $p$. 

The [[fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups]] states that every [[finite abelian group]] is the [[direct sum]] of [[cyclic groups]] of prime power [[order of a group|order]]. 

In ring theory, the [[integers modulo n]] which are [[local rings]] are precisely the [[integers modulo]] a [[prime power]].
