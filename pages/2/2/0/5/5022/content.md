## Idea

This entry is about the notion of *frame* in [[modal logic]], also called _Kripke frames_, after the philosopher and logician [[Saul Kripke]]. It is a device used by Kripke as a component of a form of [[semantics]] for modal logic, in particular, via the concept of a [[geometric model for modal logics|geometric model]]. 

The concept of a frame is an example of a [[concept with an attitude]], being merely a non-empty [[set]] equipped with a [[binary relation]] in the standard case (or some variant in the multimodal case). Its _attitude_ arises from its use as the first two components of triples that are [[geometric model for modal logics|Kripke models]].
 
Beware that this is an entirely  different concept than that of the same name used in [[geometric logic]], where the concept of *[[frames]]* (see there) refers to an abstraction of the algebraic structure of [[lattices of open subsets]] of a [[topological space]].

For modal logics involving multiple modal operators, frames are given by that number of binary relations defined on a non-empty set.
