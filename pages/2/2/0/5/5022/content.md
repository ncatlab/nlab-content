## Idea

In [[formal logic]], *Kripke frames*, after [Kripke (1959)](#Kripke59), [(1963)](#Kripke63), serve as the [[context|contextual]] substrate of [[set theory|set-theoretic]] [[semantics]]/[[models]] for [[modal logics]] (called *[[geometric model for modal logics|geometric models]]* as opposed to *[[algebraic model for modal logics|algebraic models]]*).

In itself, a Kripke frame is just 

* an [[inhabited set|inhabited]] [[set]] $W$ 

  often called the set of *[[possible worlds]]* (or the set of *nodes* or *states* or *points*)

* equipped with an [[indexed set]] of binary [[relations]] $R_i : W \times W \to Prop$, one for each [[modal operator]] $\Box_i$ in the given [[modal logic]]

  called the *accessibility* or *transition* relations between worlds, or similar, where $R_i (w,w')$ is often interpreted as (in the epistemic case): "To agent $i$ in world $w$, world $w'$ appears (just as well) possible."
 
But note that, as there are many flavors of modal logic (epistemic, aletheic, deontic, temporal, dynamic, et cetera), there are many different interpretations of the accessibility relation in the corresponding Kripke frame.

Hence a Kripke frame is a [[concept with an attitude]], namely the attitude to serve as a model for a [[modal logic]] -- the idea is to interpret:

1. the [[elements]] of $W$ as the "[[possible worlds]]" about which the [[propositions]] in the modal logic make statements, 

2. the [[relation]] $R_i(w,w')$ as asserting that it makes sense to reason about world $w'$ at world $w$.

Namely a [[geometric model for modal logics|model]] of the modal logic based on such a Kripke frame will interpret 

* each [[proposition]] $P$ of the logic as a $W$-[[dependent type|dependent]] proposition $P \colon W \to Prop$,

* each [[modal operator|modal]] proposition $\Box_i P$ as the $W$-[[dependent type|dependent]] proposition which at $w \in W$ asserts that "$P$ holds at all those $w'$ that are in $i$th relation to $W$", hence "$P$ holds in all worlds $w'$ that $i$ deems to be just as possible as $w$"; formally (eg. [Blackburn & van Benthem (2007) p. 10](#BlackburnVanBenthem07)):

> {#SubtypeNotation} (Here we are writing --- following notation for *[[subtypes]]* --- $P \,\colon\,W \to Prop$ for a $W$-[[dependent type|dependent]] [[proposition]], equivalently a proposition about the elements of $W$, equivalently the [[subset]] of $W$ where the proposition holds.)

## Definition

A (uni-modal) Kripke frame is a set $W$ and a binary $R$ relation on $W$. A multimodal Kripke frame for modal operators $\{\Box_i\}_{i \in I}$ is a set $W$ together with a binary relations $R_i$ for each $i \in I$. Equivalently, a uni-modal Kripke frame is a set $W$ and a [[coalgebra for an endofunctor|coalgebra]] for the powerset endofunctor, $f_R: W \to \mathscr{P}(W)$. A multimodal Kripke frame is, equivalently, a set $X$ and a coalgebra for the endofunctor $\mathscr{P}(I \times -)$.  

A morphism of Kripke frames, called a bounded morphism or p-morphism (short for pseudo-epimorphism) is a homomorphism of the coalgebras. 

We call the category of unimodal Kripke frames $\mathbf{Kr}$. $\mathbf{Kr}$ is dually equivalent to the category of complete, atomic, *completely additive* [[algebraic model for modal logics|boolean algebras with operators]]. This is the analogue of the result that $\mathbf{Set}$ is dually equivalent to the category of complete, atomic boolean algebras. 

A *Kripke model* for a propositional language $L$ is a Kripke frame $\langle{W, f_R\rangle}$ together with a *valuation* $V: L \to \mathbb{2}^W$ which preserves the appropriate logical structure. The non-modal connectives are handled in the usual way with their set-theoretic analogues (intersection for $\land$, union for $\lor$, complement for negation, et cetera). For the modal operator $\Box$, the truth clause is $V(\Box p)(w) = 1$ if and only if $f_R(w) \subseteq V(p)$.

We often consider particular classes of Kripke frames, identified by common features of the accessibility relations: e.g. reflexivity, transitivity, symmetry Euclidean, density, et cetera. These correspond to the validity of certain logical principles, and so, different modal logics. However, Kripke frames are not sufficient to classify all (normal) modal logics as detailed in [Holliday and Litak, 2019](#HollidayLitak19). Although every class of Kripke frames defines a normal modal logic for which the class is complete, some normal modal logics are not complete for any class of Kripke frames, a phenomenon known as "Kripke incompleteness." By duality, this means there are normal modal logics which are not complete with respect to any class of complete, atomic, completely additive boolean algebras with operators . 

Below we detail some classes of Kripke frames. 

## Some classes of Kripke frames  

**The transparent case of S5 logic.** Specifically, for the case of [[S5 modal logic]] with a single [[comonad|comonadic]] [[modal operator]] $\Box$, a Kripke frame (originally considered in [Kripke 1963](#Kripke63)) is an 

* [[inhabited set]]$\;$ $W$

equipped with a single

* [[equivalence relation]]$\;$ $R$ 

  (hence a relation which is [[reflexive relation|reflexive]], [[transitive relation|transitive]] and [[symmetric relation|symmetric]])

which means that $W$ decomposes as the [[disjoint union]] of its [[equivalence classes]], these being the [[fibers]] of the [[quotient]] [[coprojection]]

\[
  \label{QuotientCoprojectionInCaseOfS5}
  W \xrightarrow{\;\; p_W \;\;} W/R
  \,.
\]


{#NecessityLogic} **The simple case necessity logic.** In the further special case there is just a single such class (hence that "all possible worlds are related", originally considered by [Kripke 1959](#Kripke59)) this becomes

\[
  \label{QuotientCoprojectionInCaseOfGlobalS5}
  W \xrightarrow{\;\; p_W \;\;} \ast
\]

so that in [[geometric model for modal logics|models]] based on such a frame the interpretation of the [[modal operator]] $\Box$ is that of *[[necessity]]*: $\Box P$ now asserts, independently of the world that it is evaluated on, that $P$ holds at *all* $w \in W$, hence that $P$ holds *necessarily* in the sense of: no matter which world.

The general case of Kripke frames is really just this basic idea with some variations added. For instance the general case (eq:QuotientCoprojectionInCaseOfS5) of S5 modal logic is just a $W/R$-indexed [[disjoint union]] of this basic situation.



**Perspective of dependent type theory.**
As discussed in detail at *[Possible worlds via Dependent types](necessity+and+possibility#InFirstOrderLogicAndTypeTheory)*,
the Kripke model for the modal operator $\Box$ in the case (eq:QuotientCoprojectionInCaseOfGlobalS5) of [[S5 modal logic]] with a global accessibility relation is just the [[base change]] [[comonad]] along the projection (eq:QuotientCoprojectionInCaseOfGlobalS5), and the same argument immediately applies to the general S5-case (eq:QuotientCoprojectionInCaseOfS5):

\[
  \label{BaseChange}
\]
\begin{tikzcd}
    W \ar[rr, "{ p_{{}_W} }"] && W/R
    \\
    \mathrm{Prop}_W
    \ar[out=180-42, in=180+42,
      <-,
      looseness=4.5, 
      shorten=0pt,
      shift right=3pt,
      "\scalebox{1.1}{${
          \hspace{1pt}
          \mathclap{
            {
              \Box
            }
          }
          \hspace{4pt}
        }$}"{
          pos=.5, 
          swap
        }
    ]  
    \ar[
      from=rr,
      shift right=7pt,
      "{ (p_{{}_W})^\ast }"{swap}
    ]
    \ar[
      rr,
      shift right=7pt,
      "{ (p_{{}_W})_\ast }"{swap}
    ]
    \ar[
      rr,
      phantom,
      "{ \scalebox{.7}{$\bot$} }"
    ]
    &&
    \mathrm{Prop}_{W/R}
  \end{tikzcd}

**The case of S4 logic.** 
If the [[relation]] $R$ in a Kripke frame is ([[reflexive relation|reflexive]] and) [[transitive relation|transitive]] but not necessarily [[symmetric relation|symmetric]], then it still serves to provide models of [[S4 modal logic]] (cf. [Kripke 1959, ยง2](#Kripke59)).

In this case the relation no longer defines a [[groupoid]] ("[[setoid]]") as it does for the S5-case, but it defines a [[(0,1)-category]] with [[objects]] the elements of $W$.

As such, to retain the type-theoretic perspective (eq:BaseChange) in this case will require some form of *[[directed type theory]]*.
