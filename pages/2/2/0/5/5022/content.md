## Frames in Modal Logics ## 
(The term **frame** is used in a different sense in [[modal logic]] than in [[geometric logic]] where it stands for an abstraction of the algebraic structure corresponding to the [[lattice]] of [[open sets]] of a [[topological space]]; see [[frame]].)

###Frames in Monomodal Logics

We will start with the simplest case, namely a frame for the basic [modal language](/nlab/show/modal+logic#modal+language), $\mathcal{L}_\omega(1)$, (so with _one_ _binary_ modal operator, denoted $\Diamond$).

######Definition ######
A _frame_ for $\mathcal{L}_\omega(1)$ is a pair $\mathfrak{F} = (W,R)$ with $W$ a non-empty set and $R$ a binary relation on $W$.

(This is also called a basic _Kripke frame_.)

The terminology often used refers to $W$ as the set of possible worlds.  Its elements are sometimes called _worlds_, sometimes _states_, sometimes _points_, depending on the context and the whim of the writer.  The relation $R$ is called the _accessibility relation_ so $ R w v$ says '$v$ is accessible from $w$'.


(More to go here ... frames fo multimodal languages, and ones with unary and more general relations.)


## Models in Modal Logics ## 
To give the standard (geometric) semantics of modal logics one needs the models adn these will be discussed in the entry [[geometric models for  modal logics]] and the companion [[algebraic models for  modal logics]].
