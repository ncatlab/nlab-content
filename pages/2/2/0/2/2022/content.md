## Idea ##

Given a [[finite category|locally finite]] [[partially ordered set]] $C$, its _Hasse diagram_ encodes the minimal amount of information necessary to reproduce the ordering relation.

## Definition ##

Given a [[causet]] $C$, a **Hasse diagram** $H$ is the [[directed graph]] whose [[quiver]] $F(H)$ is [[equivalence|equivalent]] to $C$.
