## Idea

A [[symmetry]] is (in most classical situations) invariance under a [[group]] [[action]], or [[infinitesimal space|infinitesimally]], invariance under a [[Lie algebra]] action.

In the general sense of the word, a **supersymmetry** is invariance under a [[supergroup]] action or a [[super Lie algebra]] action. 

In the stricter sense of the word as it originates in theoretical fundamental [[physics]], _supersymmetry_ refers specifically to [[Lie superalgebra]] extensions of the [[Poincaré Lie algebra]] -- the [[super Poincaré Lie algebra]], often called the **supersymmetry algebra** in this context. An odd element in this [[super Lie algebra]] is called a **supersymmetry generator**.

Given a [[gauge theory]] whose fields are [[connection on a bundle|connections]] with values in the Poincar&#233; Lie algebra (the theory of [[gravity]] in its [[first order formulation of gravity|first order formulation]]) a supersymmetric extension_ is a similar [[gauge theory]] with fields being connections in the [[super Poincaré Lie algebra]] -- a theory of [[supergravity]]. A [[gauge transformation]] in such a theory is called a **local supersymmetry transformation**.

### In fundamental physics

Supersymmetric extensions of [[quantum field theories]] have been felt to be compelling in fundamental physics for formal reasons: the simple step from [[Lie algebra]]s to [[super Lie algebra]]s

* make a pure theory of [[gravity]] seamlessly incorporate [[fermion]]s and [[gauge field]]s;

* leads to better [[renormalization]] properties (indeed the speculation that $N=8, D=4$ [[supergravity]] is fully renormalizable -- in stark contrast to ordinary [[gravity]] has more recently been checked up to high loop orders);

* produces a wealth of interesting mathematical structures. For instance 

  * [[Morse theory]] of a [[Riemannian manifold]] can naturally be understood in terms of [[supersymmetric quantum mechanics]] for [[superparticle]]s propagating on that manifold;

  * the interpretation of [[quantum field theories]] in terms of [[generalized cohomology]] theories only works for supersymmetric theories (see [[(1,1)-dimensional Euclidean field theories and K-theory
]] and [[(2,1)-dimensional Euclidean field theory]])

  * "topological twists" of supersymmetric field theories are a major source of examples of [[TQFT]]s, for instance the [[A-model]] and the [[B-model]] [[TCFT]] arise from such twists of 2-dimensional [[supergravity]] and there are deep connections between the [[geometric Langlands correspondence]] and topologically twisted [[super Yang-Mills theory]].

Moreover, since various observables in supersymmetric QFTs are easier to compute than in non-supersymmetric theories, supersymmetric quantum field theory is being used to _approximate_ certain aspects of other QFTs. For instance certain correlators in ordinary [[Yang-Mills theory]] coupled to [[spinors in Yang-Mills theory]] can be computed using an auxioary [[super Yang-Mills theory]].

Therefore, if nothing else, supersymmetric quantum field theories constitute a part of the whole space of quantum field theories which is useful for understanding general properties of that space. What is however still missing is any experimental evidence that the world is fundamentally described by a supersymmetric quantum field theory.
