## Idea

The operation of [[stabilization]] that sends an [[(∞,1)-category]] $C$ to the [[stable (∞,1)-category]] $Stab(C)$ does not in general extend to a functor.

We may think of this operation as the analog of _linearizing_ a space. Turning an [[(∞,1)-functor]] $F : C \to D$ into a functor $Stab(C) \to Stab(D)$ is not unlike performing a first order Taylor expansion of a function.

This is what Goodwillie calculus studies.
