## Idea

Given two [[vector bundles]] $V_1 \to X$ and $V_2 \to X$ over the same base space $X$, their _tensor product of vector bundles_ $V_1 \otimes V_2 \to X$ is the vector bundle over $X$ whose [[fiber]] over any point is the [[tensor product of vector spaces]] (i.e. the [[tensor product of modules]]) of the respective fibers of $V_1$ and $V_2$.
