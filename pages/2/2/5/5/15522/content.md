## Definition

A _[[branched cover]] of the [[Riemann sphere]]_ $\mathbb{C}P^1$ is a [[compact topological space|compact]] [[connected topological space|connected]] [[Riemann surface]] $\Sigma$ equipped with a non-[[constant function|constant]] [[holomorphic function]]

$$7
 \phi: \Sigma \longrightarrow \mathbb{C}P^1
  \,.
$$ 

If we think of $\Sigma$ as retrievable from its [[field]] of [[meromorphic functions]] (see for example [Mumford 1977](#Mumford1977)), then each such map $\phi$ is dual to a [[field extension]] $\mathbb{C}(t) \hookrightarrow Func(\Sigma)$; this is an _algebraic_ field extension. The dual map $\phi$ is [[surjective map|surjective]], and restricts to a [[covering space]] projection after removing all the (finitely many) [[ramification point|ramification points]] of $\phi$. 


## Properties

### Riemann surfaces
 {#RiemannSurfaces}

By the [[Riemann existence theorem]], every [[connected topological space|connected]] [[compact topological space|compact]] [[Riemann surface]] admits the [[structure]] of a branched cover of the Riemann sphere. ([MO discussion](http://mathoverflow.net/a/53286/381))
