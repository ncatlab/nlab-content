## Idea

The notion of *homomtopy pushout* is

* the generalization of the notion of *[[pushout]]* to [[homotopy theory]], hence from [[1-category]]-[[category theory]] to [[(infinity,1)-category|$\infty$-category]] theory, and here often understood as a [[derived functor]] of the pushout-functor

* the [[formal duality|formal dual]] to the notion of [[homotopy pullback]]. For the moment, see there for more details.
