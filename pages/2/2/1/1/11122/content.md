## Idea

NBG or von Neumann-Bernays-G&#246;del set theory is a [[material set theory]].

## History

## Axioms

NBG is a [[material set theory]], based on a global binary membership [[predicate]] $\in$. The objects of NBG are called [[classes]]. If a class $x$ is a member of another class $A$, i.e., $x \in A$, then $x$ is called [[set]]. A class which is not a set is called [[proper class]]. NBG can be presented as a two-sorted theory, with lowercase letters denoting sets and uppercase letters denoting classes.

The first axioms of NBG is the axiom of [[axiom of extensionality|Extensionality]]: two classes are equal if and only if the have the same members.

The next axioms regard sets and are identical to the [[ZFC]] axioms of [[axiom of extensionality|Extensionality]], [[axiom of pairing|Pairing]], [[axiom of union|Union]], [[axiom of power sets|Power Sets]] and [[axiom of infinity|Infinity]].

The last, distinguishing, two axioms of NBG are:
