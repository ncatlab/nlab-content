## Idea 

Just as a [[functor|functor]] is a [[morphism]] between [[category|categories]], a natural transformation is a [[2-morphism]] between two functors.

Natural transformations are the [[2-morphism]]s in the [[2-category]] [[Cat]].


## Definition ##

### Explicit definition

Given [[categories]] $C$ and $D$ and [[functors]] $F,G \colon C \to D,$ a __natural transformation__ $\alpha \colon F \Rightarrow G$ between them, denoted

\begin{xymatrix}
  C
  \ar@/^2pc/[rr]^-{ F }_-{\ }="s"
  \ar@/_2pc/[rr]_-{ G }^-{\ }="t"
  &&
  D
  %
  \ar@{=>}^-{\alpha} "s"; "t"
\end{xymatrix}

is an assignment to every [[object]] $x$ in $C$ of a [[morphism]] 
$\alpha_x:F(x) \to G(x)$ in $D$ (called the __component__ of $\alpha$ at $x$) such that for any morphism $f:x \to y$ in $C$, the following [[diagram]] [[commuting diagram|commutes]] in $D$:

\begin{centre}
  \begin{tikzcd}
    F(x) \arrow[r, "F(f)"] \arrow[d, "\alpha_x"'] & F(y) \arrow[d, "\alpha_y"] \\
    G(x) \arrow[r, "G(f)"']                        & G(y)                       
  \end{tikzcd}
\end{centre}

### Composition

Natural transformations between functors $C \to D$ and $D \to E$ compose in the obvious way to natural transformations $C \to E$ (this is their [[vertical composition]] in the [[2-category]] [[Cat]])
and functors $F : C \to D$ with natural transformations between them form the [[functor category]] 

$$
  [C,D] \in Cat
$$ 

The notation alludes to the fact that this makes [[Cat]] a [[closed monoidal category]].  Since $Cat$ is in fact a [[cartesian closed category]], another common notation is $D^C$.  In fact, if we want $Cat$ to be [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]], the definition of natural transformation is forced (since an [[adjoint functor]] is unique). This is discussed in [a section below](#InTermsOfCartMon).

There is also a [[horizontal composition]] of natural transformations, which makes [[Cat]] a [[2-category]]: the [[Godement product]]. See there for details. 

In fact, [[Cat]] is a 2-category (a $Cat$-enriched category) _because_ it is (cartesian) closed: closed monoidal categories are automatically enriched over themselves, via their [[internal hom]].

### In terms of morphismwise components
{#morphismwiseDefn}

An alternative but ultimately equivalent way to define a natural transformation $\alpha : F \rightarrow G$ is as an assignment to every morphism $m : x \rightarrow y$ in $C$ of a morphism $\alpha(m) : F(x) \rightarrow G(y)$, in such a way as that $G(m_1)\alpha(m_0) = \alpha(m_1)F(m_0)$ for every binary composition $m_1 m_0$ in $C$ (or equivalently $\alpha(m_2 m_1 m_0) = G(m_2) \alpha(m_1) F(m_0)$ for every ternary composition $m_2m_1m_0$ in $C$).

The relation of this to the previous definition is that the commutative squares in the previous definition for any morphism $f$ give the value $\alpha(f) = G(f) \circ \alpha_x = \alpha_y \circ F(f)$, and the identity morphisms for any object $x$ give the component $\alpha_x = \alpha(id_x)$.

Vertical composition of natural transformations can be specified directly in terms of this account as well: specifically, an $n$-ary composition $\alpha_1 ... \alpha_n$ of natural transformations is uniquely determined by the property that $(\alpha_1 ... \alpha_n)(m_1 ... m_n) = \alpha_1(m_1) ... \alpha_n(m_n)$, for every $n$-ary composition $m_1 ... m_n$ in $C$.

Horizontal composition is even easier, as the horizontal composite of $\alpha_1, ..., \alpha_n$ is just $\alpha_1 ... \alpha_n$.

### In terms of the cartesian closed monoidal structure on $Cat$ {#InTermsOfCartMon}

The definition of the [[functor category]] $[C,D]$ with morphisms being natural transformations is precisely the one that makes $Cat$ a [[cartesian monoidal category|cartesian]] [[closed monoidal category]].

The category [[Cat]] of all categories (regarded for the moment just as an ordinary 1-[[category]]) is a [[cartesian monoidal category]]: for every two categories $C$ and $D$ there is the cartesian [[product]] category $C \times D$, whose objects and morphisms are simply pairs of objects and morphisms in $C$ and $D$: $Mor(C \times D) = Mor(C) \times Mor(D)$.

It therefore makes sense to ask if there is for each category $C \in Cat$ an [[internal hom]] functor $[C,-] : Cat \to Cat$ that would make [[Cat]] into a [[closed monoidal category]] in that for $A,B,C \in Cat$ we have natural isomorphisms of _sets_ of functors

$$
  Funct(A \times C , B) \simeq Funct(A, [C,B])
  \,.
$$

This is precisely the case for $[C,B]$ being the [[functor category]] with functors $C \to B$ as objects and natural transformations, as defined above, as morphisms.

Since $Cat$ here is cartesian closed, one often uses the exponential notation $C^B := [B,C]$ for the functor category.

To derive from this the definition of natural transformations above, it is sufficient to consider the [[interval category]] $A := I := \{a \to b\}$. For any category $E$, a functor $I \to E$ is precisely a choice of morphism in $E$. This means that we can check what a morphism in the [[internal hom]] category $[C,B]$ is by checking what functors $I \to [C,B]$ are. But by the defining property of $[C,B]$ as an [[internal hom]], such functors are in natural bijection to functors $I \times C \to B$.

$$
  Funct(I, [C,B]) \simeq Funct(I \times C, B)
  \,.
$$

But, as mentioned above, we know what the category $I \times C$ is like: its morphisms are pairs of morphisms in $I$ and $C$, subject to the obvious composition law, which says in particular that for $f : c_1 \to c_2$ any morphism in $C$ we have

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    (c_1,a) \stackrel{(f,(a \to b))}{\to} (c_2,b)
    & =
    (c_1,a) \stackrel{(f, Id)}{\to} (c_2,a) 
    \stackrel{(Id, (a \to b)}{\to}
    (c_2, b)
    \\
    &=
    (c_1,a) \stackrel{(Id, (a\to b))}{\to} (c_1,b) 
    \stackrel{(f,Id}{\to}
    (c_2, b)
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

Here the right side is more conveniently depicted as a commuting square

$$
  \array{
     (c_1,a) &\stackrel{(f,Id)}{\to}& (c_2,a)
     \\
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(Id,(a \to b))}} 
     && 
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(Id, (a \to b))}}
     \\
     (c_1,b) &\stackrel{(f,Id)}{\to}& (c_2,b)
  }
  \,.
$$

So a natural transformation between functors $C \to D$ is given by the images of such squares in $D$. By tracing back the way the hom-isomorphism works, one finds that the image of such a square in $D$ for a natural transformation $\alpha : F \to G$ is the naturality square from above:

$$
  \array{ 
    F(c_1) 
    & 
    \stackrel{F(f)}{\to} 
    & 
    F(c_2) 
    \\ 
    \alpha_x\downarrow 
    && 
    \downarrow \alpha_y 
    \\ G(c_1) 
    & 
    \stackrel{G(f)}{\to} & G(c_2) 
  }
  \,. 
$$ 


### In terms of double categories 

There is a nice way of describing these structures due to [[Charles Ehresmann]]. For a category $D$ let $(\square D,\circ_1,\circ_2)$  be the [[double category]] of commutative squares in $D$. Then the class of natural transformations of functors $C \to D$ can be described as $Cat(C,(\square D,\circ_1))$. But then $\circ_2$ induces a category structure on this and so we get $CAT(C,D)$. 

An advantage of this approach is that it applies to the case of topological categories and groupoids (working in a convenient category of spaces). 

An analogous approach works for strict cubical $\omega$-categories with connections, using the good properties of [[cube]]s, so leading to a [[closed monoidal category|monoidal closed structure]] for these objects. This yields by an [[equivalence of categories]] a monoidal closed structure on [[strict omega-category|strict globular omega-categories]], where the [[tensor product]] is the [[Crans-Gray tensor product]].

## Examples ##
 {#Examples}

\begin{example}\label{UnitOfDoubleDualization}
**(unit of double-dualization)**
\linebreak
  For any [[ground field]] $\mathbb{K}$,
  the canonical [[linear map]] from a [[vector space]] $V$ to its [double dual](dual+vector+space#DoubleDualVectorSpaces) $\big(V^{\ast}\big)^\ast$ 
\[\label{UnitMapToDoubleDual}\]
\begin{tikzcd}[sep=0pt]
  V \ar[rr] && \big(V^\ast\big)^\ast
  \\
  v 
    &\mapsto& 
  \big(
    \omega(-) \mapsto \omega(v)
  \big)
\end{tikzcd}
is a natural transformation 
$$
  Id \longrightarrow \big((-)^{\ast}\big)^\ast
$$

from the [[identity functor]] $Id$ on [[Vect|$\mathbb{K} Vect$]] to the [[composition]] $\big((-)^{\ast}\big)^\ast$ of the [[linear dual space|linear dual]]-[[endofunctor]] with itself.

This example was the motivating example of [Eilenberg & MacLane 1945](#EilenbergMacLane45) (right on the first pages) for introducing the notion of natural transformation (and with it [[category theory]]) in the first place.

The conceptual subtlety that these authors sought to resolve here is that for any *[[finite-dimensional vector space|finite-dimensional]]* [[vector space]] there exists also an [[isomorphism]] from $V$ to its *single*-[[dual vector space]]:

$$
  V \in \mathbb{K} Vect^{fdim}
  \;\;\;\;\;\;
  \vdash
  \;\;\;\;\;\;
  \exists
  \;
  V \xrightarrow{\sim} V^\ast
  \,.
$$

But these linear maps are conceptually different from (eq:UnitMapToDoubleDual) in that they are *not natural* in the technical sense that they do not form the components of a natural transformation between the evident functors. Instead they involve an arbitrary choice equivalent to that of an (possibly indefinite) [[inner product]] on $V$, which is not preserved by general [[linear isomorphisms]] (but just by the corresponding [[isometries]]).
\end{example}

\begin{example}
For a category $C$ its [[category of presheaves]] $Set^{C^op}$ has for objects all functors $C^op \rightarrow  Set$ and for morphisms all natural transformations between those presheaves.  If the objects in that category can be seen as being some type of [[graph]] then its morphisms are graph [[homomorphisms]] which in this case are natural transformations.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
The [[determinant]] is a natural transformation $det\colon GL_n\rightarrow (-)^\times$ from the [[general linear group]] to the [[group of units]] of a [[ring]], which are both functors from [[Ring]] to [[Grp]].
\end{example}

\begin{example}
The [[Frobenius homomorphism]] is a natural transformation $Frob_p\colon Id_{Ring_p}\Rightarrow Id_{Ring_p}$ from the [[identity functor]] on the [[full subcategory]] of [[Ring]] containing all rings with [[characteristic]] $p$ to itself.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
The [[Hurewicz homomorphism]] is a natural transformation $h_n\colon\pi_n\Rightarrow H_n(-;\mathbb{Z})$ from the [[homotopy group]] to [[singular homology]], which are both functors from [[Top]] to $Grp$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
The inversion $G\rightarrow G^{op},g\mapsto g^{-1}$ for every [[group]] $G$ yields a natural transformation $\Id_{Grp}\Rightarrow -^{op}$ from the [[identity functor]] on $Grp$ to the [[opposite group]] functor.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
The projection $G\rightarrow G^{ab},g\mapsto[g]$ for every group $G$ yields a natural transformation $\Id_{Grp}\Rightarrow -^{ab}$ from the [[identity functor]] on $Grp$ to the [[abelianization]] functor. 
\end{example}

## Properties ##

The following properties come from the [[HoTT book]]. 

It follows that the type of [[natural transformations]] from $F$ to $G$ is a set.

### Composites with functors ###
For [[functors]] $F : A \to B$ and $G,H : B  \to C$ and a natural transformation $\gamma : G \to H$, the composite $(\gamma F) : G F \to H F$ is given by

* For each $a:A$, the component $\gamma_{F a}$.

Naturality is easy to check. Similarly, for $\gamma$ as above and $K : C \to D$, the composite $(K \gamma): K G \to K H$ is given by

* For each $b: B$, the component $K(\gamma_b)$.


### Lemma 9.2.8 in the HoTT book ###
For [[functors]] $F,G: A\to B$ and $H,K: B \to C$ and natural transformations $\gamma : F \to G$ and $\delta : H \to K$, we have

$$(\delta G)(H \gamma) = (K \gamma) (\delta F).$$

**Proof.** It suffices to check componentwise: at $a:A$ we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
  ((\delta G)(H \gamma))_a &\equiv (\delta G)_a (H \gamma)_a \\
  &\equiv \delta_{G a} \circ H(\gamma_a)\\
  &= K(\gamma_a) \circ \delta_{F a} \qquad (by\ naturality\ of\ \delta) \\ 
  &\equiv (K \gamma)_a \circ (\delta F)_a\\
  &\equiv ((K \gamma)(\delta F))_a.\ \square
\end{aligned}
$$

## Variations

For functors between [[n-category|higher categories]], see [[lax natural transformation]] etc.

A transformation which is natural only relative to [[isomorphisms]] may be called a [[core-natural transformation|canonical transformation]].

For functors with more complicated shapes than $C \rightrightarrows D$, see [[extranatural transformation]] and [[dinatural transformation]].
