## Idea

There are various [[norms]] that may be placed on the [[tensor product]] of the underlying [[vector spaces]] of two [[Banach spaces]]; the result is not usually [[complete space|complete]], but of course we may take its [[completion]].  One of these, the _projective tensor product_, makes [[Ban]] (the category of Banach spaces and [[short linear maps]]) into a [[closed monoidal category]], but any of them makes $Ban$ into a [[symmetric monoidal category]].  If we start with [[Hilbert spaces]], then a different choice of norm is needed to make the result into a Hilbert space; then [[Hilb]] also becomes a closed symmetric monoidal category.


## Definitions

Let $V$ and $W$ be [[Banach spaces]], and let $V \otimes W$ be their [[tensor product]] as [[vector spaces]].  To define a tensor product of $V$ and $W$ as Banach spaces, we will place a [[norm]] on $V \otimes W$, making a [[normed vector space]]; the only difference in the following definitions is which norm to use.  Then we take the completion $V \hat{\otimes} W$, which is a Banach space.

###### Definition (projective tensor product)

Every element of $V \otimes W$ may be written (in many different ways) as a formal [[linear combination]] of formal products of elements of $V$ and $W$:
$$ \sum_i \alpha_i v_i w_i .$$
Let the __projective cross norm__ ${\|x\|_\pi}$ of an element $x$ of $V \otimes W$ be
$$ {\|x\|_\pi} \coloneqq \inf \{ \sum_i {|\alpha_i|} {\|v_i\|_V} {\|w_i\|_W} \;|\; x = \sum_i \alpha_i v_i w_i \} .$$
Then __projective tensor product__ $V \hat{\otimes}_\pi W$ of $V$ and $W$ is the completion of $V \otimes W$ under the projective cross norm.

###### Definition (injective tensor product)

If $\lambda$ and $\mu$ are [[linear functionals]] on $V$ and $W$ (respectively), then $\lambda \otimes \mu$ is a linear functional on $V \otimes W$.  Let the __injective cross norm__ ${\|x\|_\epsilon}$ of an element $x$ of $V \otimes W$ be
$$ {\|x\|_\epsilon} \coloneqq \sup \{ {|(\lambda \otimes \mu)x|} \;|\; {\|\lambda\|_{V^*}}, {\|\mu\|_{W^*}} \leq 1 \} .$$
Then __injective tensor product__ $V \hat{\otimes}_\epsilon W$ of $V$ and $W$ is the completion of $V \otimes W$ under the injective cross norm.

###### Definition (tensor product of Hilbert spaces)

If $V$ and $W$ are [[Hilbert spaces]], then their norms determine and are determined by their [[inner products]], so let us discuss inner products.  The elements of $V \otimes W$ are generated by elements of the form $v w$, so set
$$ \langle{v_1 w_1, v_2 w_2}\rangle \coloneqq \langle{v_1, v_2}\rangle \langle{w_1, w_2}\rangle $$
and extend by linearity.  We write the norm of an element $x$ of the [[inner product space]] $V \otimes W$ as ${\|x\|_\sigma}$.  Then the __tensor product__ $V \hat{\otimes}_\sigma W$ of the Hilbert spaces $V$ and $W$ is the completion of $V \otimes W$ under this norm (or inner product).

## Cross norms

Besides the specific norms defined above, we can define axioms of a reasonable norm on $V \otimes W$.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition (cross norm)

A __cross norm__ on $V$ and $W$ is *any* [[norm]] $\chi$ on $V \otimes W$ such that:

*  ${\|v \otimes w\|_\chi} = {\|v\|_V} {\|w\|_W}$ for any elements $v$ and $w$ of $V$ and $W$ (respectively);
*  ${\|\lambda \otimes \mu\|_{\chi^*}} = {\|\lambda\|_{V^*}} {\|\mu\|_{W^*}}$ for any [[bounded operator|bounded]] [[linear functionals]] $\lambda$ and $\mu$ on $V$ and $W$ (respectively).

###### Definition (uniform cross norm)

A __uniform cross norm__ is an operation that takes two Banach spaces and returns a norm on their algebraic tensor product, [[natural transformation|naturally]] in the two spaces.  Equivalently, it\'s a [[functor]] $\chi\colon Ban \times Ban \to NVect$ that makes the following diagram commute (or fills it with a [[natural isomorphism]]):
$$ \array { Ban \times Ban   & \overset{\chi}\rightarrow     & NVect \\
            \downarrow       &                               & \downarrow \\
            Vect \times Vect & \underset{\otimes}\rightarrow & Vect
} $$

A uniform cross norm is obviously desirable from the [[nPOV]], but does it meet the analysts\' needs for a cross norm?  Yes:

###### Proposition

A uniform cross norm assigns a cross norm to any two Banach spaces.
=--

The specific cross norms from the previous section qualify as much as possible:

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The projective and injective cross norms are uniform cross norms (and hence are in fact cross norms).  The norm on the algebraic tensor product of two Hilbert spaces is also a cross norm.
=--

As far as I can tell, the Hilbert-space cross norm $\sigma$ doesn\'t apply to arbitrary Banach spaces, so it doesn\'t define a uniform cross norm as defined above; however, it does define a functor on $Hilb \times Hilb$, so it\'s as uniform as could be expected.

Looking only at the general theory of cross norms, the projective and injective cross norms appear naturally:

+-- {: .num_prop #topbot}
###### Proposition

If $\chi$ is any uniform cross norm, $V$ and $W$ are any Banach spaces, and $x$ is any element of $V \otimes W$, then
$$ {\|x\|_\epsilon} \leq {\|x\|_\chi} \leq {\|x\|_\pi} .$$
=--

That is, we have a [[poset]] of uniform cross norms, and the projective and injective cross norms are (respectively) the [[top]] and [[bottom]] of this poset.

Although $\sigma$ is not a uniform cross norm, it relates to $\epsilon$ and $\pi$ in the same way:

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

If $V$ and $W$ are Hilbert spaces and $x$ is an element of $V \otimes W$, then
$$ {\|x\|_\epsilon} \leq {\|x\|_\sigma} \leq {\|x\|_\pi} .$$
=--

+-- {: .query}
Actually, this would all be simpler if Propostion \ref{topbot} applied to *arbitrary* cross norms and not just uniform ones.  Perhaps it does.  Or perhaps $\sigma$ extends to a uniform cross norm on all of $Ban$; that would also make things simpler.  I don\'t know.
=--

Of course, any cross norm $\chi$ on $V$ and $W$ allows us to form the Banach space $V \hat{\otimes}_\chi W$, which may reasonably be called a __tensor product__ of $V$ and $W$; that\'s why we care.


## Foundational issues

We need the [[Hahnâ€“Banach theorem]] for $\epsilon$ to be a cross norm; but $\sigma$ and $\pi$ work regardless.  Possibly some of the other propositions rely on some other form of the [[axiom of choice]]; I haven\'t seen their proofs.
