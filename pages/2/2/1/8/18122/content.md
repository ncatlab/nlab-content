## Definition

A [[topological space]] is called _countably compact_ if every [[open cover]] consisting of a [[countable set]] of [[open subsets]] (every [[countable cover]]) admits a [[finite cover|finite subcover]], hence if there is a [[finite set|finite]] [[subset]] of the open in the original cover which still cover the space.

## Examples

* A [[compact space]] is *a fortiori* countably compact. 

* A [[sequentially compact space]] is countably compact. 

For the case of metric spaces, [[countably compact metric spaces are equivalently compact metric spaces]]. 

* The [[long line]] is an example of a countably compact space that is not compact.
