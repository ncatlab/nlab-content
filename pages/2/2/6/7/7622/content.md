## Idea

In [[statistical physics]] the _thermodynamic limit_ denotes the limiting behaviour of a [[physical system]] that consists of many components ([[particles]]) as

* the [[volume]] $V$ and the number $N$ of particles tends to [[infinity]];

* the density ratio $\rho \coloneqq N/V$ approaches a constant value.

Many characteristic properties of macroscopic physical systems only appear in this limit, notably [[phase transitions]], [[universality classes]] and other [[critical phenomena]].

## Related concepts

* [[universality class]]

* [[quantum lattice system]]

  **Abstract** Statistical mechanics applies to large systems: technically, its results are exact only for infinitely large systems in "the thermodynamic limit." The importance of this proviso is often minimized in undergraduate courses. This paper presents six paradoxes in statistical mechanics that can be resolved only by acknowledging the thermodynamic limit. For example, it demonstrates that the widely used microcanonical "thin phase space limit" must be taken after taking the thermodynamic limit.
