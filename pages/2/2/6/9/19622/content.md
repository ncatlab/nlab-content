## Idea

Often in [[category theory]], requirements that certain things "be [[isomorphism|isomorphic]]" are more precisely stated as saying that a certain "canonical" [[morphism]] is [[invertible morphism|invertible]].  However, in certain situations, it happens that the existence of a non-canonical isomorphism automatically *entails* the "correct" stronger property that the canonical morphism is invertible.

For now, see the references for details.
