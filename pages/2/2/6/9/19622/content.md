## Idea

Often in [[category theory]], requirements that certain things "be [[isomorphism|isomorphic]]" are more precisely stated as saying that a certain "canonical" [[morphism]] is [[invertible morphism|invertible]].  However, in certain situations, it happens that the existence of a non-canonical isomorphism automatically *entails* the "correct" stronger property that the canonical morphism is invertible.

For now, see the references for details.

## Examples

* If $\mathcal{C}^{\otimes}$ a [[symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category]] which attains a symmetric monoidal equivalence to a [[cartesian symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category]], then there is a [[contractible space]] of symmetric monoidal equivalences $\mathcal{C}^\otimes \simeq \mathcal{C}^\times$ lifting the identity [[endofunctor]] of $\mathcal{C}$.
