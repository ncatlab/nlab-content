A crucial ingredient in a [[topos]] is a [[subobject classifier]]. That this has to do with [[subobjects]] turns out to the a coincidence of low dimensions. As discussed at [[stuff, structure, property]], the classifying objects in [[higher topos theory]] classify more general morphisms.

When one passes all the way to $\infty$-toposes, there should be objects that classify _all_ morphisms. This is made precise in the context of [[(∞,1)-topos]] [[higher topos theory|theory]].

One way to characterize an [[(∞,1)-topos]] is as 

* a [[presentable (∞,1)-category]]

* with [[universal colimits]]

* such that for all sufficiently large [[regular cardinal]]s $\kappa$ there is a **classifying object** for the class of all $\kappa$-compact morphisms in $X$.

This statement is originally due to [[Charles Rezk]]. It is reproduced as theorem 6.1.6.8 in

* [[Jacob Lurie]], [[Higher Topos Theory]].

David Corfield: What are the object classifiers for [[Top]]?

[[Mike Shulman]]: I presume you mean Top as a model for $\infty Gpd$?  I expect that you get them by looking at the $\infty$-groupoid [[core]] of the $(\infty,1)$-category of all $\kappa$-compact $\infty$-groupoids.

[[David Corfield]]: Thanks. Do we have this $\kappa$-compact business explained somewhere? Should I also be thinking about the [[universal fibration of (infinity,1)-categories|universal fibration of (infinity,1)-groupoids]]?

[[Urs Schreiber]]: see [[compact object]]
