## Idea

For the moment, the analog of the [[Grothendieck construction]] for [[(∞,1)-categories]] is described at [[Cartesian fibration]] and at [[universal fibration of (∞,1)-categories]]. 

The correspondence between $(\infty,1)$-categorical [[cartesian fibrations]] $E \to C$ and [[(infinity,1)-presheaf|(∞,1)-presheaves]] $C \to (\infty,1)Cat^{op}$ is [[model category|modeled]] by the [[Quillen equivalence]] between the [[model structure on marked simplicial over-sets]] and the projective [[global model structure on simplicial presheaves]].
