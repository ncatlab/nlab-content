Some of the subfields of topology and geometry touched in the nlab: [[general topology]], [[homotopy theory]], [[rational homotopy theory]], [[differential geometry]] (including [[symplectic geometry]], [[synthetic differential geometry]]), [[differential topology]], [[algebraic geometry]], [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]], [[noncommutative geometry]].  

Nowdays however there exist many frameworks in which in a unified way, the main objects (kinds of spaces, like schemes or supermanifolds) in several of the above categories can be obtained, for example [[ringed space]], [[ringed site]], [[structured (infinity,1)-topos]]...

Here are some nonexahustive but longer grouped-lists of entries: [[geometry]], [[topology]].
