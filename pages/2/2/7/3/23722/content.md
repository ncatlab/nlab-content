## Idea ##

By a *preconvergence space* we shall mean the most general notion of [[topological space]] for which the notion of [[convergence]] and of [[limit of a net|limit]] for [[nets]] makes sense. Notice that the possibly more natural term "[[convergence space]]" for this notion is already taken to mean a set with [[filters]] that are isotone, centered, and directed, and that definition is not the most general definition for which the notions of convergence and limit makes sense for nets. 

## Definition ##

A set $S$ is a __preconvergence space__ if it comes with a [[binary relation]] $x \to c$ between the (large) set of all [[net]]s in $S$ and $S$ itself, for elements
$$x \in \bigcup_{I \in DirectedSet_\mathcal{U}} S^I$$
and $c \in S$
