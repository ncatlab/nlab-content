## Idea ##

By a *preconvergence space* we shall mean the most general notion of [[topological space]] for which the notion of [[convergence]] and of [[limit of a net|limit]] for [[filters]] and [[nets]] makes sense. Notice that the possibly more natural term "[[convergence space]]" for this notion is already taken to mean a set with [[filters]] that are isotone, centered, and directed, and that definition is not the most general definition for which the notions of convergence and limit makes sense for nets. 

## Definition ##

Given a set $S$, let $\mathcal{F}(S)$ denote the set of [[filters]] on $S$. A set $S$ is a __preconvergence space__ if it comes with a [[binary relation]] $x \to c$ between the $\mathcal{F}(S)$ and $S$ itself, for elements $x \in \mathcal{F}(S)$ and $c \in S$. 

The definition can also be phrased in terms of [[nets]]; a net $\nu$ converges to $x$ if and only if its [[eventuality filter]] converges to $x$.

The morphisms of preconvergence spaces are the [[pointwise continuous functions]]; a function $f$ between preconvergence spaces is __pointwise continuous__ if $F \to x$ implies that $f(F) \to f(x)$, where $f(F)$ is the filter generated by the [[filterbase]] $\{F(A) \;|\; A \in F\}$.
