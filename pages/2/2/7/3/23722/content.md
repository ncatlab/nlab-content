## Idea ##

By a *preconvergence space* we shall mean the most general notion of [[topological space]] for which the notion of [[convergence]] and of [[limit of a net|limit]] for [[filters]] and [[nets]] makes sense. Notice that the possibly more natural term "[[convergence space]]" for this notion is already taken to mean a set with [[filters]] that are isotone, centered, and directed, and that definition is not the most general definition for which the notions of convergence and limit makes sense for nets. 

## Definition ##

### In terms of filters

Given a set $S$, let $\mathcal{F}(S)$ denote the set of [[filters]] on $S$. A set $S$ is a __preconvergence space__ if it comes with a [[binary relation]] $x \to c$ between the $\mathcal{F}(S)$ and $S$ itself, for elements $x \in \mathcal{F}(S)$ and $c \in S$. 

The morphisms of preconvergence spaces are the [[pointwise continuous functions]]; a function $f$ between preconvergence spaces is __pointwise continuous__ if $F \to x$ implies that $f(F) \to f(x)$, where $f(F)$ is the filter generated by the [[filterbase]] $\{F(A) \;|\; A \in F\}$. 

### In terms of nets

A set $S$ is a **preconvergence space** if for each [[directed set]] $I$, there is a [[binary relation]] $x \to_I c$ between the set of all $I$-indexed [[nets]] in $S$ and $S$ itself, for $x \in S^I$ and $c \in S$. A preconvergence space is **[[Hausdorff]]** if each binary relation $x \to_I c$ is a [[functional relation]] for all directed sets $I$. 

The morphisms between preconvergence spaces are the **limit-preserving functions**: a function $f$ between preconvergence spaces $S$ and $T$ is **limit-preserving** if for all [[directed sets]] $I$, [[nets]] $x \in S^I$ and elements $c \in S$, $x \to_I c$ implies that $(f \circ x) \to_I f(c)$, where $f \circ x \in T^I$ is the [[net]] generated by [[composition|precomposition]] of the net $x$ by the function $f$. These functions can be called **netwise limit-preserving functions** to contrast with [[sequential limit-preserving functions]], which only preserve sequential limits in preconvergence spaces. These functions can also be called **[[continuous functions]]** or **[[pointwise continuous functions]]**, since [[net#ContinuousFunctionsDetectedByNets|nets detect the continuity of functions between them]]. 

The [[isomorphisms]] between preconverence spaces $S$ and $T$ are the [[bijections]] $f$ from $S$ to $T$ such that for all directed sets $I$ and nets $x \in S^I$ and elements $c \in S$, $x \to_I c$ [[if and only if]] $(f \circ x) \to_I f(c)$.
