## Idea ##

The most general space where the notion of convergence and limit for nets makes sense, but the term "[[convergence space]]" is already taken to mean a set with filters that are isotone, centered, and directed, and that definition is not the most general definition for which the notions of convergence and limit makes sense for nets. 

## Definition ##

A set $S$ is a __preconvergence space__ if it comes with a [[binary relation]] $x \to c$ between the (large) set of all [[net]]s in $S$ and $S$ itself, for elements
$$x \in \bigcup_{I \in DirectedSet_\mathcal{U}} S^I$$
and $c \in S$
