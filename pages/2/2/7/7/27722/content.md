#### Scott Adjunction

Started drafting the page. Help in completing it is welcome.

## Motivations and idea

The original motivations and applications for this construction come from model theory [Henry], but a lot of its scientific placing and naming choices have a geometric flavour. Mention higher topology and formal model theory are keywords. Create separate entries for those.

### Geometric aspect
To be written. Reproduce parts of Sec 1 of Towards higher topology and mention categorification.

### Logical aspects
To be written. Free geometric theory associated to a topos. Recap of the intro of Formal Model Theory & Higher Topology. 

## Applications
To be written. Focus on Henry's work.
