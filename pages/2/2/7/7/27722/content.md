## Motivations and idea

The original motivations and applications for the *Scott adjunction* come from [[model theory]] &lbrack;[Henry 2019](#Henry2019)&rbrack;, but a lot of its scientific placing and naming choices have a [[geometry|geometric]] flavour. 




### Geometric intuition

####Rudiments on the Scott topology

> To be written. Reproduce parts of Sec 1 of [Di Liberti 2022](#DiLiberti22) and mention categorification.

The set of points of a locale has both a canonical topology and canonical partial order. The first of these structures gives raise to the sometimes called Isbell adjunction [cite towards higher topology], which related locales to topological spaces.

[Insert here statement of the adjunction]

The duality between sober spaces and locales with enough points is a very celebrated result in the theory of dualities, and many other dualities of topological kind happen as sub dualities of this one.

For the second structure, let us recall a couple of properties of such partial order. Let O be a locale. Then its poset of points has directed joins, and every morphism of locales induces a directed join preserving morphism of posets. Thus we obtain a (2-) functor from the (2-)category of locales to that of posets with directed joins.

It is natural to wonder wether this process can be reversed, i.e. whether we can associate a locale to a directed poset with joins, hoping for assigning a topology to each reasonable poset.

In the 1980s Scott defined the Scott topology of a good enough poset, which assigns to a poset with directed joins a topological space. Yet, an analysis of this construction yields precisely what we are looking for. For P a locale, and T the booleans, the poset Pos(P,T) is precisely the opens of the Scott topology over P, and provides a locale associated to our posets.
