A [[coverage]], [[Grothendieck topology]], or [[Grothendieck pretopology]] (all of which are different ways of presenting a [[site]]) is said to be **subcanonical** if all [[representable functor|representable functors]] are [[sheaf|sheaves]].  Of course, a **subcanonical site** is one whose coverage is subcanonical.

The term "subcanonical" comes about because the largest coverage for which the representables are sheaves is called the **canonical coverage**, and the subcanonical coverages are precisely the "sub-coverages" of the canonical one.


## Effective-epimorphic sieves ##

An alternate definition is that a Grothendieck coverage is subcanonical if and only if all of its covering [[sieve|sieves]] $R\hookrightarrow C(-,U)$ are **effective-epimorphic**, meaning that the morphisms $f:V\to U$ in $R$ form a colimit cone under the diagram consisting of _all_ morphisms between them over $U$.  To see this, first recall that if $R\hookrightarrow C(-,U)$ is a sieve, then a functor $X:C^{op}\to Set$ satisfies the [[sheaf]] axiom for $R$ if and only if

* for every family $(x_f)_{f\in R}$ which is compatible, in the sense that $X(g)(x_f) = x_{f g}$ whenever this makes sense, there exists a unique $x\in X(U)$ such that $x_f = X(f)(x)$.

Interpreting this when $X$ is a representable functor $C(-,Z)$, we obtain

* for every family of maps $(h_f:V\to Z)$, where $f:V\to U$ is in $R$, such that $h_f g = h_{f g}$ for any $g:V'\to V$, there exists a unique $k:U\to Z$ such that $h_f = k f$.

But this says precisely that $R$ is effective-epimorphic, as defined above.

In fact, since the covering sieves in a subcanonical coverage must also satisfy pullback-stability, they must be not only   effective-epimorphic but __universally effective-epimorphic__ (meaning that any pullback of them is effective-epimorphic).  It is then easy to see that the canonical coverage consists precisely of all the universally effective-epimorphic sieves.

Note also that if $f:V\to U$ is a single morphism having a [[kernel pair]] $p,q:V\times_U V \;\rightrightarrows\; V$, then the sieve generated by $f$ is effective-epimorphic iff $f$ is the [[coequalizer]] of its kernel pair, and thus iff $f$ is a [[regular epimorphism]].


## Discussion

This is from the old [[subcanonical pretopology]].

[[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: Does this page deserve to coexist with [[subcanonical coverage]] or should it redirect?

[[Zoran Skoda]: I did not see the other page. I looked for subcanonical topology, subcanonical site and did not find anything. Coverage is far less standard term which will be hence overlooked by a casual and external user of nlab and human google seeker for wiki pages. As you see I did not find it. Now I put the link, let it be the way it is: for example [[subcanonical coverage]] does not have the term subcanonical site explained so the search does not find that term.  

_Toby_:  In principle this could exist separately, since [[coverage]] and [[Grothendieck pretopology]] are not defined the same way, but in practice I would redirect unless something is written that really makes use of the description as a pretopology rather than as a coverage.
