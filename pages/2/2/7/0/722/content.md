A [[coverage]], [[Grothendieck topology]], or [[Grothendieck pretopology]] (all of which are different ways of presenting a [[site]]) is said to be **subcanonical** if all [[representable functor|representable functors]] are [[sheaf|sheaves]].

The term "subcanonical" comes about because the largest coverage for which the representables are sheaves is called the **canonical coverage**, and the subcanonical coverages are precisely the "sub-coverages" of the canonical one.

Mike (or whoever), I\'m still a relative novice to sites, so I\'d find it helpful if you could explain just how a coverage\'s being canonical will make every cover the quotient of its kernel pair, as you seemed to imply on [[anafunctor]].

(I ask here rather than there, since the result would belong on this page.)
