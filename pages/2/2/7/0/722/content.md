A [[coverage]], [[Grothendieck topology]], or [[Grothendieck pretopology]] (all of which are different ways of presenting a similar thing) is said to be **subcanonical** if all [[representable functor|representable functors]] are [[sheaf|sheaves]].

The term "subcanonical" comes about because the largest coverage for which the representables are sheaves is called the **canonical coverage**, and the subcanonical coverages are precisely the "sub-coverages" of the canonical one.
