## Idea

A __vector field__ is a [[section]] of a [[vector bundle]].

More specifically, a vector field is a _[[tangent vector field]]_ which is a [[section]] of a [[tangent bundle]]. Hence this is a function which picks a [[tangent vector]] at each point of a manifold, such that this assignment is suitably [[differentiable function|differentiable]].

Equivalently this is a rank $(1,0)$-[[tensor field]] on $X$

## Properties

### As derivations of smooth functions

Vector fields may be identified with [[derivations]]
on the [[algebra of functions|algebra of]] [[smooth functions]].
See the article *[[derivations of smooth functions are vector fields]]*.
