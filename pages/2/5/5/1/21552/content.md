## Definitions

A [[concrete point|point]] $P$ of a [[topological space]] $X$ is __isolated__ if it is a [[neighbourhood]] of itself, in other words if the [[singleton subset]] $\{P\}$ is [[open subset|open]].

More generally, a point $P$ of a [[subset]] $A$ of a space $X$ is __isolated__ in $A$ if it is isolated when viewed as a point in the [[subspace]] $A$ with the [[subspace topology]].  More explicitly, for some [[neighbourhood]] $U$ of $P$ (in $X$), $U \cap A = \{P\}$.

The antithetical concept is that of an [[accumulation point]].


## Properties

Every [[function]] on $X$ is [[continuous function|continuous]] at $P$ if $P$ is isolated.
