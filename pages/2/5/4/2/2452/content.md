This is a sub-entry of [[geometric models for elliptic cohomology]] and [[A Survey of Elliptic Cohomology]] 

See there for background and context.

This entry here is about the fact and its derivation that the [[partition function]] of a [[(2,1)-dimensional Euclidean field theories]] is a [[modular form]].

#Idea#

As described at  [[(2,1)-dimensional Euclidean field theories and tmf]], the idea is that [[(2,1)-dimensional Euclidean field theories]] are a [[geometric models for elliptic cohomology|geometric model for tmf]] [[cohomology theory]]. 

While there is no complete proof of this so far, here
we discuss the construction and proof -- due to [[Stephan Stolz]] and [[Peter Teichner]]  -- 
for the situation over the point: the [[partition function]] of a $(2|1)$-dimensional EFT is a modular form. Hence $(2|1)$-dimensional EFTs do yield the correct [[cohomology ring]] of [[tmf]] over the point.
