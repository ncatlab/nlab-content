## Idea

In the context of [[real-oriented cohomology theory]], notably in _[[KR-theory]]_, by "real space" ("real manifold") one means a [[topological space]] (a [[manifold]]) equipped with an [[group action|action]] of the [[cyclic group|cyclic]] [[group of order 2]] $\mathbb{Z}/2$ (a "non-linear [[real structure]]").

In the context of [[string theory]] real spaces appear as [[orientifold]] [[target space|target]] [[spacetimes]]. The involution [[fixed points]] here are known as _[[O-planes]]_.

## Examples

### Real circles

There are three non-equivalent real structures on the [[circle]] $S^1$, usually denoted

* $S^{2,0}$ for the trivial involution;

* $S^{1,1}$ for the reflection involution (identifying the two semi-circles);

* $S^{0,2}$ for the antipodal involution (rotation by $\pi$).

Accordingly [[real-oriented cohomology theory]] is bigraded in a way modeled on this bigrading.

(This is standard notation, but maybe $S^{1,0}$, $S^{\tfrac{1}{2}, \tfrac{1}{2}}, S^{0,1}$ would be more suggestive. Indeed the quotients in the first and the last case are actually circles, while in the second case it is the semi-circle.)

### Complexified cartesian spaces

The complex $n$-dimensional complexified cartesian space ${\mathbb{C}}^n$ equipped with its conjugative involution is a real space. Explicitly, this involution sends $(z^1,\ldots, z^n)$ to $(\bar{z^1},\ldots, \bar{z^n})$.

### Complex projective spaces.

The complex $n$-dimensional complex projective space ${\mathbb{P}}^n_{\mathbb{C}}$ equipped with a conjugation involution is a real space. For each choice of affine chart, the conjugation involution of this chart (which is biholomorphic to ${\mathbb{C}}^n$) extends to a conjugation involution on ${\mathbb{P}}^n_{\mathbb{C}}$. Any two conjugation involutions are ${\mathbb{Z}}/2$-equivariantly diffeomorphic.

For example, the Riemann surface ${\mathbb{P}}^1_{\mathbb{C}}$ is diffeomorphic to the 2-sphere $S^2$ and its conjugation involution is the antipodal action.

### Complex general and special linear groups.

For $A$ a square matrix, the determinant of its conjugation transpose equals the conjugate of its determinant. In symbols, ${\mathrm{det}} A^* = \overline{{\mathrm{det}} A}$. Hence sending a square matrix to its conjugate transpose is an involution on the complex general $GL(n,{\mathbb{C}})$ and special $SL(n,{\mathbb{C}})$.

In particular, the real space $SL(1,{\mathbb{C}})$ equipped with this conjugate transpose involution is equivariantly diffeomorphic to $S^{0,2}$, the circle equipped with its antipodal action (dicussed above).

## Properties

### Relation to real cobordism

There is a "real" analog of [[complex cobordism cohomology theory]] $MU$, the [[MR cohomology theory]] $M \mathbb{R}$.

While $\pi_\bullet(M \mathbb{R})$ is _not_ the [[cobordism ring]] of [[real manifolds]], still every [[real manifold]] does give a class in $M \mathbb{R}$ ([Kriz 01, p. 13](#Kriz01)). For details see here: [pdf](http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/fm/fm161/fm16115.pdf).
