## Idea

A [[stochastic process]] is *time-reversible* if it is symmetric under [[time-reversal symmetry|time reversal]]. 

This symmetry is meant in a _stochastic_ sense: it says that *given any trajectory, its reverse trajectory has the same probability of happening*. 


## Definition

A [[stationary stochastic process]] $(X_t)_{t\in T}$ is called **time-reversible** if and only if for all finite $t_1 \lt \dots \lt t_n$, we have that the finite [[joint and marginal distribution|marginals]]
$$
(X_{t_1},\dots,X_{t_n}) \qquad and \qquad (X_{t_n},\dots,X_{t_1})
$$
have the same [[joint distribution]].

(The definition outside the stationary case does not seem to appear in the literature.)


## Examples

* A [[Markov process]] or [[Markov chain]] is time-reversible if and only if it satisfies [[detailed balance]]. In particular, every [[idempotent Markov chain]] is time-reversible.
* Every [[exchangeable process]] is time-reversible, in particular [[Bernoulli processes]] are.
