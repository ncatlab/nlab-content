
"Jet Nestruev" is a group pseudonym (like "[[Nicolas Bourbaki]]") that was used by [[Alexandre Vinogradov]] in co-authorship with participants of his seminar (this according to [gdeq.org/Alexandre_Vinogradov](https://gdeq.org/Alexandre_Vinogradov)).

Form the foreword (dated 2019) of (the second edition of) [Nestruev 2020](#Nestruev02):

> Unlike the famous French general \[Nicolas Bourbaki\], Jet Nestruev is a civilian, and the names of the members of his team are not veiled in secrecy, as are those of the Bourbaki team. For the first edition, they were: Alexander Astashov, Alexey
Bocharov, Sergei Duzhin, Alexandre Vinogradov, Mikhail Vinogradov, and Alexey Sossinsky. For the present second edition, they are Alexander Astashov, Alexandre Vinogradov, Mikhail Vinogradov, and Alexey Sossinsky. The figures for both editions were expertly prepared by Alexander Astashov.
