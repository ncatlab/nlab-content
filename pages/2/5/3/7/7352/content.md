The term **quiver variety** refers to a number of varieties constructed as moduli spaces of representations of quivers.  The most important are the Nakajima quiver varieties, which moduli of stable representations of [[preprojective algebras]], introduced by [[Hiraku Nakajima]] in 

*  [[Hiraku Nakajima]], _Quiver varieties and Kac-Moody algebras._ Duke Math. J. 91 (1998), no. 3, 515&#8211;560.
* [[Hiraku Nakajima]], _Instantons on ALE spaces, quiver varieties, and Kac-Moody algebras._ Duke Math. J. 76 (1994), no. 2, 365&#8211;416

These are notable for allowing a geometrical construction of the universal enveloping algebra of Kac-Moody algebras acting on the cohomology of quiver varieties and related spaces.
