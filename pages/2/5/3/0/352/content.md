## Idea


The term *$\infty$-category* broadly refers to [[higher categories]] with no bound on the dimension $n$ of their [[n-morphisms|$n$-morphisms]].

There are two different ways this is understood more in detail:

Historically, a tower of notions of [[n-categories]] ([[0-category|0-]], [[1-category|1-]], [[2-category|2-]], [[3-category|3-]], [[4-categories]], ...) was continued to a limiting case of "[[omega-categories]]", and sometimes "$\infty$-categories" is used synonymously in this sense, broadly referring to the most general notion of [[higher categories]]. Beware that this general notion is not well developed nor is the equivalence or not of the few existing models, but see for instance the entries *[[weak omega-category]]*, *[[weak complicial set]]* and *[[opetopic omega-categories]]* .

The more fine-grained organization of types of higher categories by bidegree is better understood: [[(n,r)-categories]] for $n = \infty$, hence [[(infinity,1)-categories|$(\infty,1)$-categories]], have by now a very well developed theory with ubiquitous applications, and many authors refer to these [[(infinity,1)-categories|$(\infty,1)$-categories]] (aka: *[[quasi-categories]]*) as just "$\infty$-categories", for short (some authors even just say "categories" now, for this case, with a [[homotopy theory|homotopy-theoretic]] background foundation tacitly understood).

In terms of the terminology of [[(n,r)-categories|$(n,r)$-categories]], the previous general notion of $\infty$-categories may be referred to as *$(\infty,\infty)$-categories*
