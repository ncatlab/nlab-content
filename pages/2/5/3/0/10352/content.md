  > **In memoriam Joël Scherk** 

  > Joël Scherk died on May 16, 1980. Although 33 years old, he had made many very important discoveries in dual [[string theory]] and [[supergravity]], as will be manifest in this review. It is striking to note how logical and sustained the development of his thinking was.

  > His first important contribution was the [[renormalization]] of the [[one-loop]] [[open string|open]] dual [[string scattering|string amplitude]]. Then he developed the idea of the zero-slope limit when all masses except the lightest tend to infinity, and found that this leads to [[quantum field theories]]. In particular the [[closed string]] sector yielded [[general relativity]], and from then on he was fascinated by [[gravitation]]. The [[one-loop]] contributions of the [[open string|open string model]] in $d = 26$ dimensions [[Goddard-Thorn no-ghost theorem|were shown]] to correspond to a new ghost-free set of states, corresponding to closed Strings and interpreted as Pomeron states. One of these states was described by an [[B-field|antisymmetric tensor gauge field]], which is nowadays of interest. Then he started wondering what happens with the extra dimensions in our four-dimensional world. This led him to the idea of spontaneous compactification of space-time, extending [[Kaluza-Klein compactification|ideas of Kalusza and Klein]]. 

  > In [[supergravity]] he started by solving the matter [[interaction|coupling]] problem and worked out the super-[[Higgs effect]]. Then he constructed the [[D=4 N=3 supergravity|$N = 3$ supergravity]], and both the $SO(4)$ and the $SU(4)$ versions of [[D=4 N=4 supergravity|$N=4$ extended supergravity]]. The latter model was suggested by taking the zero slope limit of the [[superstring theory|$d = 10$ dimensional closed string dual model with fermions]]. The $d = 10$ open string model yielded in the zero slope limit [[D=4 N=4 SYM|$N = 4$ supersymmetric Yang—Mills theory]]. In the $SU(4)$ model he found a noncompact $SU(1, 1)$ [[global symmetry]], and in the $N = 2, 3, 4$ models he gave a complete treatment of the duality and chiral symmetries. He then formulated [[D=11 N=1 supergravity|$N = 1 d = 11 supergravity$]], which yields the [[D=4 N=8 supergravity|$N=8$ $d=4$ model]] upon [[Kaluza-Klein reduction|dimensional reduction]]. He also developed the idea of [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] by means of dimensional reduction, and worked out the particle spectrum. There he found a massless vector boson and proposed the idea that it yields the (testable) force of antigravity. 

  > Despite this impressive record, Joel was a relaxed and very friendly person. He was among the best and most pedagogical speakers and his articles were crystal clear. He was always open to discussion and had a very developed sense of humour. He also contributed actively to the popularization of [[theoretical physics]] by radio talks, lectures for lay-men and articles in popular scientific magazines.
