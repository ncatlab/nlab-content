## Idea

The _Jordan-H&#246;lder theorem_ says that every _[[composition series]]_ of a given [[group]], and every _[[Jordan-Hölder sequence]]_ on a given object in an [[abelian category]], has the same length, and the same [[simple object|simple]] factors, up to [[permutation]]. In particular says that the [[length of an object]] in an abelian category is well defined.

More generally, a form of the theorem holds in any [[homological category]].
