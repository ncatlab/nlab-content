## Idea
 {#Idea}

In the way that [[model categories]] serve as presentations for their [[homotopy category of a model category|homotopy categories]] or more generally of their [[simplicial localization|associated]] [[(infinity,1)-categories|$\infty$-categories]] so the general notion of *localization of a model category* &lbrack;[Hirschhorn (2002), Def. 3.1.1](#Hirschhorn02)&rbrack; serves to invert morphisms in the [[homotopy category]] such as to present [[localization of an (infinity,1)-category|localization of]] that $\infty$-category.

To quote [Hirschhorn (2002), p. xi](#Hirschhorn02):

> 'Localizing a model category with respect to a class of maps does not mean making the maps into isomorphisms; instead, it means making the images of those maps in the homotopy category into isomorphisms. Since the image of a map in the homotopy category is an isomorphism if and only if the map is a weak equivalence, localizing a model category with respect to a class of maps means making maps into weak equivalences.'

In practice, the most prominent notion of localization of model categories is *[[Bousfield localization of model categories]]* (see there for more), which is a special case, by [Hirschhorn (2002), Thm. 3.3.19](#Hirschhorn02).
