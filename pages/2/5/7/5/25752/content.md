\section{Definition}

Let $R$ be a [[commutative ring]]. Then a **pointed $R$-module** is an $R$-[[module]] $M$ with an additional point $1 \in M$. If $R$ is a [[field]], then the structure is also called a **pointed $R$-vector space**. 

Equivalently, a pointed $R$-module is an $R$-[[module]] $M$ with an $R$-[[linear map]] $R \to M$. Since $R$ is the [[tensor unit]] for the [[tensor product of modules]] in the [[monoidal category]] [[Mod|$R \mathrm{Mod}$]] of $R$-modules and $R$-linear maps, pointed $R$-modules are also [[pointed object in a monoidal category|pointed objects in the monoidal-categorical sense]] in addition to [[pointed set|pointed objects in the set-theoretic sense]]. 

The second definition also implies that the [[category]] of pointed $R$-modules is equivalently the [[coslice category]] $R \mathrm{Mod}^{R/}$ of $R$-modules under $R$ itself.
