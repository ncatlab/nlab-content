## Idea

The definition of _semicategory_ or _category without units_  is like that of [[category]] but omitting the requirement of [[identity]]-morphisms.

This generalizes the notions of [[semigroup]], [[semiring]], etc: 

* a [[semigroup]] is (the [[hom-set]] of) a semicategory with a single object;

* a [[semiring]] is (the [[hom-set]] of) a semicategory [[enriched category|enriched]] in [[Ab]] with a single object.


Semicategories, like categories, appear as [[semipresheaf|semipresheaves]] on the category with two objects and two morphisms.  

## Definition

A **semicategory** or **category without units** $C$ consists of 

* a [[collection]] $C_0$ of _objects_;

* a collection $C_1$ of _morphisms_ (or _arrows_);

* two maps $s, t : C_1 \to C_0$ called _source_ (or _domain_) and _target_ (or _codomain_);

  * one writes $f : x \to y$ if $s(f) = x$ and $t(f) = y$;

* a rule which assigns to any pair of morphisms $f$, $g$ such that $t(f) = s(g)$ their _composite_ morphism $g \circ f \in C_1$ (also  written $g f$ or sometimes $f;g$&#8212; see [[diagrammatic order]]);

* such that the following properties are satisfied:

  * source and target are respected by composition: $s(g \circ f) = s(f)$ and $t(g\circ f) = t(g)$;

  * composition is _associative_: $(h \circ g)\circ f = h\circ (g \circ f)$ whenever $t(f) = s(g)$ and $t(g) = s(h)$;

People often write $hom(x,y)$, $hom_C(x,y)$, or $C(x,y)$ for the collection of morphisms $f : x \to y$; the latter two have the advantage of making clear which category is being discussed.  People also often write $x \in C$ instead of $x \in C_0$ as a short way to indicate that $x$ is an object of $C$.  Also, some people write $Ob(C)$ and $Mor(C)$ instead of $C_0$ and $C_1$.

## Example

Start with the category of metric spaces and short maps. An occasionally useful semicategory can be formed from it by considering the nonempty spaces and strictly contractive functions. 

This is a semicategory, since:

* the composition of two strictly contractive functions is strictly contractive
* identity maps are not contractive (they are trivial isometries)

The interest in this semicategory arises from the fact that all morphisms $f : A \to A$ have unique fixed points, by Banach's fixed point theorem. 

## In higher category theory

The concept of semicategory has more or less evident analogs and generalizations in [[higher category theory]].

For models of higher categories by [[simplicial set]]s, i.e. presehaves on the [[simplex category]] (such as [[Kan complex]]es, [[quasi-categories]], [[weak complicial set]]s)  the corresponding semi-category notion is obtained by discarding the degeneracy maps (which are the identity-assigning maps in the simplicial framework), i.e. by considering just presheaves on the subcategory $\Delta_+ \subset \Delta$ on injective morphisms (see the discuss of $\Delta_+$ at [[Reedy model structure]] for more details).

[[Simpson's conjecture]] says that every $\infty$-category has a model where all [[composition]] operations are strict and only the [[unit law]]s hold up to [[coherent]] homotopies. This would mean that the $\infty$-semicategory underlying any $\infty$-category can always be chosen to be strict.
