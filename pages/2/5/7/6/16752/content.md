A **Sasakian manifold** is a [[contact manifold]] $(M,\theta)$ equipped with a [[Riemannian manifold|metric]] such that its [[cone (Riemannian geometry)|Riemannian cone]] is a [[Kähler manifold]].

An example is an odd-dimensional sphere $S^{2n-1} \subset \mathbb{C}^n\setminus\{\mathbf{0}\}$, where the ambient complex manifold carries its standard K&#228;hler structure.

When the Riemannian cone is a [[hyper-Kähler manifold]], then one talks of a **3-Sasakian manifold**. Such a manifold is then automatically [[Einstein manifold|Einstein]] and [[spin structure|spin]].
