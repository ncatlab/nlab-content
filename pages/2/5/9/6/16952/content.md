## Idea

In [[equivariant stable homotopy theory]] a _[[genuine G-spectrum]]_  has [[homotopy groups]] [[grading|graded]] not just by the [[integers]], but by the (additive group underlying) the [[representation ring]] of $G$. This is often called _$RO(G)$-grading_. 

>  In equivariant cohomology theory, the use of $RO(G)$ is a great convenience, but it is not the thing most intrinsic to the mathematics.  Ignore the multiplication on $RO(G)$,  which is irrelevant to its use for grading theories, and think of it just as an abelian group.  Send a representation $V$ to the isomorphism class of the suspension $G$-spectrum of the one-point compactification $S^V$.  This induces a homomorphism from $RO(G)$ into the Picard group $Pic(Ho G\mathcal{S})$ of the stable homotopy category of  $G$-spectra, namely the abelian group of equivalence classes of 
$G$-spectra that are invertible under the smash product.  That homomorphism  is neither a monomorphism nor an epimorphism.  See ([Fausk-Lewis-May 01](#FauskLewisMay01)) for a discussion of that Picard group.  Logically, equivariant cohomology theories really should be graded on $Pic(Ho G\mathcal{S})$, but that group is much less  convenient than $RO(G)$.  ([P.
