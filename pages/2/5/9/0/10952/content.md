## Some writings
 
* Andrei Rodin, _Vladimir Voevodsky on the concept of mathematical structure in his letter exchange with Andrei Rodin_ ([arXiv:2409.02935](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02935))

On a HoTT-inspired conception of mathematical [[structure]] put forward by Vladimir Voevodsky in our email exchange dating back to 2016, which he illustrated with a historical example of Euclid's definition of plane angle. 

* Andrei Rodin, _Does Identity Have Sense?_ 
 ([PhilSci:23860](https://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/23860/))

On the concept of [[identity]] in HoTT including [[directed type theory]].


On models of homotopy type theory:
