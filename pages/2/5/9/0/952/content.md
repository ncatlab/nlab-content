A __symmetric set__ is a [[simplicial set]] $X$ equipped with additional _transposition maps_ $t^n_i: X_n \to X_n$ for $i=0,\ldots,n-1$.  These transition maps generate an [[action]] of the [[symmetric group]] on $X_n$ and satisfy certain commutation relations with the face and degeneracy maps.

The result is that a symmetric set is a [[presheaf]] of sets on the category [[FinSet]] of [[finite set]]s (or at least on its [[skeleton]]).

An analogy to keep in mind is
: symmetric set : simplicial set :: [[groupoid]] : [[category]]
