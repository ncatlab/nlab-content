Let $C$ and $D$ be [[category|categories]]; we generally assume that $D$ is [[small category|small]].  Let $f:D\to C$ be a [[functor]] (called a _diagram_ in this situation). Then a __cocone__ (or _inductive cone_) over $f$ is a a pair $(e,u)$ of an object $e\in C$ and a natural transformation $u : f\to \Delta e$ (where $\Delta e$ is the constant diagram $\Delta e:D\to C$, $x\mapsto e$, $x\in D$). 

A __morphism of cocones__ $(e,u)\to (e',u')$ is a morphism $\gamma:e\to e'$ in $C$ such that $\gamma\circ u_x=u'_x$ for all objects $x$ in $D$ (symbolically $(\Delta \gamma)\circ u = u'$); the composition being the composition of underlying morphisms in $C$. Thus cocones form a category whose [[initial object]] if it exists is a [[colimit]] of $f$.
