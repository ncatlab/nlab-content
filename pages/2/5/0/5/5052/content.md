## Idea

The Doplicher-Roberts [[reconstruction theorem]] allows one to reconstruct a compact group or supergroup from its category of representations, given enough extra structure on this category.  Unlike some other versions of [[Tannaka duality]], such as [[Deligne's theorem on tensor categories]], it does not require knowledge of the forgetful functor from the category of representations to $Vect$ (the so-called [[fiber functor]]).

This result is named after [[Sergio Doplicher]] and [[John Roberts]], and it serves in [[AQFT]] as an intrinsic characterization of the [[superselection sector]]s of a [[quantum field theory]]. See [[DHR superselection theory]].
A simplified and self-contained proof was given by Michael Müger (see below).

In brief, the theorem says that every symmetric tensor ∗-category with conjugates, direct sums, subobjects and $End(1)= \mathbb{C}$ is equivalent to the category of finite dimensional unitary representations of a compact supergroup, which is unique up to isomorphism.  For definitions of these terms, see Müger's paper.

There are non-isomorphic finite groups whose categories of representations are equivalent considered merely as tensor categories, ignoring the symmetric structure:
