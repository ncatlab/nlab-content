## Idea

The slogan is "[[instantons]] at finite [[temperature]]", which are given by certain periodic Yang-Mills solutions. Calorons gave their name to the [[caloron correspondence]].

## History

The paper [Harrington-Shepard 1978](#Harrington-Shepard_78) considers the contribution from periodic solutions at _positive, finite_ temperature to the [[Yang-Mills equations]] to the action of a 'Yang-Mills gas': an equilibrium ensemble of YM fields. They give explicit solutions to the classical equations of motion 'of charge 1' i.e. representing a generator in the [[homotopy group]] classifying topologically inequivalent solutions. 

Note that at zero temperature, instantons are just of the form of the [[BPST instanton]].

[[Werner Nahm|Nahm]] ([Nahm 1984](#Nahm_84)) continued the study of calorons, linking them with self-dual [[monopoles]] and the [[ADHM construction]].
