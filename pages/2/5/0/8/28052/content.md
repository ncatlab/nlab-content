## Idea

In the [[spectral theory]] of [[operator algebras]], the *discrete spectrum* is that part of the [[spectrum of a linear operator]] which looks like the set of [[eigenvalues]] of a [[matrix]], hence of a linear operator acting on a [[finite-dimensional vector space]]/[[finite-dimensional Hilbert space]].

## Definition

The *discrete spectrum* of a [[closed linear operator]] on a [[Hilbert space]] consists of those points in its [[operator spectrum]] which are

1. isolated points: they have an [[open neighbourhood]] in containing no other points of the spectrum,

2. of finite algebraic multiplicity.

The second clause simplifies for [[self-adjoint operators]], where it is equivalent to corresponding [[eigenspace]] being [[finite-dimensional vector space|finite-dimensional]] (cf. [Moretti 2017 Rem. 9.15](#Moretti2017)), hence to the condition that the *geometric multiplicity* is finite.


## Properties

The discrete spectrum is a [[subset]] of the point spectrum, but does in general not coincide with the point spectrum.
