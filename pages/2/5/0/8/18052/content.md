## Idea

Countable dense linear orders without endpoints are unique up to isomorphism, and are canonically modeled by the [[rational numbers]] $(\mathbb{Q}, \lt )$.


## Definition

The theory $\mathsf{DLO}$ of the _dense linear order without endpoints_ is the [[first-order theory]] of $(\mathbb{Q}, \lt)$. It is axiomatized by the usual axioms of a linear order, plus the sentences which state that the order is dense and that there is neither an upper nor lower bound on the order.

## Remarks

* $\mathsf{DLO}$ is a prototypical [[stability theory|unstable structure]].

* Cantor's theorem (the uniqueness up to isomorphism of a model of $\mathsf{DLO}$ assuming the model is countable) says precisely that $\mathsf{DLO}$ is an [[omega-categorical structure | omega-categorical]] theory. 

* Since $\mathsf{DLO}$ is unstable, however, its uncountable models fall into many isomorphism classes.

* [[Dedekind cut|Dedekind cuts]] arise as [[type (in model theory)|types]] over bounded infinite parameter sets in a single variable.

* $\mathsf{DLO}$ is a [[Fraïssé limit]]; its finitely-generated substructures are precisely the finite linear orders.

* $\mathsf{DLO}$ admits [[quantifier-elimination]].

* If we view $(\mathbb{Q},&lt;)$ as a category, the [[subobject classifier]] of the topos $\mathbf{Sets}^\mathbb{Q}$ can be identified in a canonical way with the [[Dedekind cut|Dedekind cuts]] on $\mathbb{Q}$.

* Let $(A,\lt)$ be a model of $\mathsf{DLO}$. Then $A$ has a [[frame]] of [[open subsets]] with respect to its linear order. When regarded as a [[locale]], the frame of open subsets is isomorphic to the [[locale of real numbers]].
