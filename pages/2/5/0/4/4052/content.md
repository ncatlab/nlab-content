## Idea

The notion of **2-topos** is the generalization of the notion of [[topos]] from [[category theory]] to the [[higher category theory]] of [[2-categories]].  

There are multiple conceivable such generalizations, depending in particular on whether one tries to generalize the notion of [[Grothendieck topos]] or of [[elementary topos]], and in the latter case what axioms one chooses to take as the basis for generalization.

In contrast, $(2,1)$-[[topos|toposes]] are much better understood, as a special case of $(\infty,1)$-[[(infinity,1)-topos|toposes]].

A _Grothendieck 2-topos_ is a [[2-category]] of [[2-sheaves]] over a [[2-site]].

See also [[higher topos theory]].

## Examples

The archetypical 2-topos is [[Cat]].
