## Idea

The notion of **2-topos** is the generalization of the notion of [[topos]] from [[category theory]] to the [[higher category theory]] of [[2-categories]].  There are multiple conceivable such generalizations, depending in particular on whether one tries to generalize the notion of [[Grothendieck topos]] or of [[elementary topos]], and in the latter case what axioms one chooses to take as the basis for generalization.

See also [[higher topos theory]].
