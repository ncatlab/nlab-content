__Maschke's theorem__: Given a finite group $G$ and a field $k$, the group algebra $kG$ is simple iff the characteristic of the base field does not divide order of the group (that is in the characteristic zero always and in the prime characteristic if $|G|$ is invertible number). 

If the base $k$ is just a commutative unital ring then there is the following statement: if $|G|1_k$ is invertible in $k$, then an exact sequence of $kG$-modules splits iff it splits after applying the forgetful functor from $kG$-modules to $k$-modules (and the splitting in ${}_{kG}Mod$ can be functorially constructed from the splitting as a ${}_{k}Mod$). If $k$ is a field, it follows that the $kG$ is semisimple, thus this statement can be understood as a generalization of Maschke's theorem. This is also one of the motivations for the concept of a [[separable functor]].
