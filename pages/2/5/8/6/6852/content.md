## Definition

A __real distribution__ on a real [[smooth manifold]] $M$ is a [[real vector bundle|real vector subbundle]] of the [[tangent bundle]] $T M$. 

A __complex distribution__ is a [[complex vector bundle|complex vector subbundle]] of the [[complexification|complexified]] tangent bundle $T_{\mathbb{C}}M$ of $M$. 

A __distribution of [[hyperplanes]]__ is a distribution of [[codimension]] $1$ in $T M$; a __distribution of complex hyperplanes__ is a distribution of complex codimension $1$ in $T_{\mathbb{C}} M$. 

## Examples

One class of examples comes from smooth [[foliations]] by [[submanifolds]] of constant dimension $m\lt n$. Then the [[tangent vectors]] at all points to the submanifolds forming the foliation form a distribution of subspaces of dimension $m$. The distributions of that form are said to be __[[integrable distribution|integrable]]__.
