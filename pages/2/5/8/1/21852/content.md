## Idea

Since [[Calabi-Yau manifolds]] have, in particular [[special unitary group|SU]]-[[G-structure|structure]], they represent classes in [[SU-bordism theory]]. In fact, _all_ non-[[torsion element|torsion]] $SU$-bordism classes are represented by products of linear combinations of classes of  Calabi-Yau manifolds. Those in degree $4$ are spanned by the [[K3-surface]].

## Preliminaries


We write $\Omega^{SU}_\bullet$ for the [[SU-bordism ring]].

###### Proposition

The [[kernel]] of the [[forgetful functor|forgetful]] morphism

$$
  \Omega^{SU}_\bullet
  \longrightarrow
  \Omega^{\mathrm{U}}_\bullet
$$

from the [[SU-bordism ring]] to the [[complex bordism ring]], is pure [[torsion subgroup|torsion]].

###### Proposition

The [[torsion subgroup]] of the [[SU-bordism ring]] is concentrated in degrees $8k+1$ and $8k+2$, for $k \in \mathbb{N}$.

###### Proposition

Every [[torsion element]] in the [[SU-bordism ring]] $\Omega^{SU}_\bullet$ has [[order of an element|order]] 2.

###### Proposition
**([[SU-bordism ring]] [[localization of a ring|away from 2]] is [[polynomial algebra]])**

The [[SU-bordism ring]] with [[localization of a ring|2 inverted]] is the [[polynomial algebra]] over $\mathbb{Z}\big[\tfrac{1}{2}\big]$ on one generator in every even degree $\geq 4$:

$$
  \Omega^{SU}\big[\tfrac{1}{2}\big]
  \;\simeq\;
  \mathbb{Z}
  \big[
    \tfrac{1}{2}
  \big]
  \big[
    \{
      y_{2i+4}
    \}_{i \in \mathbb{N}}
  \big]
  \,.

###### Proposition
**([[K3-surface]] [[linear span|spans]] [[SU-bordism ring]] in degree 4)**

The degree-4 generator $y_4 \in \Omega^{SU}_4$ in the [[SU-bordism ring]] (Prop. \ref{SUBordismRingAwayFromTwo}) is represented by minus the class of any (non-[[torus]]) [[K3-surface]]:

$$
  \Omega^{SU}_4 \;\simeq\; \mathbb{Z}\big[ \tfrac{1}{2}\big]\big\langle -[K3] \big\rangle
  \,.

###### Proposition
**([[Calabi-Yau manifolds]] in complex dim $\leq 4$ generating the [[SU-bordism ring]] in $deg \leq 8$ [[localization of a ring|away from 2]])**
