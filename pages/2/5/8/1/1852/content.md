A [[topological space]] $X$ is __normal space__ or $T_4$-space if it satisfies the following two separation axioms 

* $T_1$ (every point in $X$ is closed)

* $T_4$ (for every two closed disjoint subsets $A,B\subset X$ there are open neighborhoods $U\supset A$, $V\supset B$ such that $U\cap V\neq\emptyset$.

For some traditions, $T_1$ is sometimes not included in the definition of a normal space, or of a $T_4$-space, even for some the $T_4$-space is stronger version than normal. The class of normal spaces has been introduced by Tietze (1923) and Aleksandrov-Uryson (1924). 

Every [[metric space]] is normal. Every normal space is an Urysohn space, a fortiori regular and a fortiori Hausdorff.
Every regular space with second countability axiom is normal. Every paracompact Hausdorff space is normal (Dieudonne's theorem). For normal spaces, Tietze extension theorem holds.
