## Idea

An ordinary [[locally small category]] $\mathcal{C}$ has for any ordered pair of  [[object]]s $x,y$ a [[hom-set]] $\mathcal{C}(x,y)$&#8212;an object in the category [[Set]].

For $\mathcal{C}$ more generally an [[enriched category]] over a [[closed monoidal category]] $\mathcal{V}$, there is --  by definition -- for all $x,y$ an _object_ $\mathcal{C}(x,y) \in obj V$ that plays the role of the "collection of morphisms" from $x$ to $y$.

Accordingly, if here $\mathcal{V}$ is a category of "spaces" of sorts, then one also speaks of a _hom space_. 
For instance if $\mathcal{V}$ =[[vector spaces]] such that $\mathcal{C}$ is a [[linear category]], then hom-spaces are vector spaces.


Or if $\mathcal{V}$=[[topological spaces]] such that $\mathcal{C}$ is [[topologically enriched category]], then hom-spaces are [[topological spaces]]. If this last example is regarded in the context of [[homotopy theory]], then one may consider just the [[homotopy type]] of these topological spaces, which is equivalently modeled as a [[simplicial set]] ([[Kan complex]]) and thought of as an [[infinity-groupoid]]. In all these cases people still often speak of "hom spaces", but see at _[[derived hom space]]_.


## Examples

* The category Prop of [[proposition]]s is enriched over itself. Hence for any two proposition $a,b$, there is a hom-proposition $Prop(A,B)$. This is the [[implication]] proposition $a \implies b$. 

* The category [[Set]] of [[set]]s is enriched over itself. Hence for any two sets $A,B$, there is a hom-set $Set(A,B)$. This is the [[function set]] $A \to B$. 

* The category [[Grpd]] of [[groupoid]]s is enriched over itself. Hence for any two groupoids $A,B$, there is a [[hom-groupoid]] $Grpd(A,B)$. This is the [[functor category]] $Func(A,B)$.

* The category [[Pos]] of [[poset]]s is enriched over itself. Hence for any two posets $A,B$, there is a hom-poset $Pos(A,B)$, the poset of [[monotone]]s.
