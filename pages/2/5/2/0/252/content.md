## Idea

An ordinary [[small category]] $C$ has for any ordered pair of  [[object]]s $x,y$ a [[hom-set]] $C(x,y)$.

For $C$ more generally an [[enriched category]] over a [[closed monoidal category]] $V$, there is --  by definition -- for all $x,y$ an _object_ $C(x,y) \in obj V$ that plays the role of the "collection of morphisms" from $x$ to $y$

## Examples

* The category [[Grpd]] of [[groupoid]]s is a enriched over itself. Hence for any two groupoids $A,B$, there is a [[hom-groupoid]] $Grpd(A,B)$. This is the [[functor category]] $Func(A,B)$.
