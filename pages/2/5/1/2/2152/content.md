In middle and high schools, analytic geometry refers to elementary methods in the geometry of $n$-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] involving *coordinate calculations*; it is usually combined with linear algebra taught in a geometric way.

In research mathematics, when one says analytic geometry, analytic refers to [[analytic function]]s in the sense of Taylor expansion and by __analytic geometry__ one usually means the study of geometry of complex (holomorphic) [[manifold]]s, their analytic subsets, [[Stein domain]]s and related notions. Similarly to an [[algebraic variety]], an [[analytic variety]] is locally given as a locus of a set of zeros of a finite family of holomorphic functions. A short survey can be found in a chapter of Dieudonne's _Panorama of pure mathematics_. 

In addition to analytic geometry over complex numbers, there is also another formalism which allows for nonarchimedean ground fields. This is the subject of [[rigid analytic geometry]]. Similarly to [[scheme]]s, rigid analytic varieties are glued from [[Bercovich spectrum|Bercovich spectra]] of certain commutative Banach algebras, so-called [[affinoid]]s, in a certain [[Grothendieck topology]]. There are several variants of the formalism (e.g. due Huber). The subject is closely related to [[formal geometry]] and has its main applications in [[arithmetic geometry]] and [[representation theory]]. It is an open problem to find an appropriate analogue of rigid analytic geometry in [[noncommutative geometry]], which is supposed to play an important role in mirror symmetry.
