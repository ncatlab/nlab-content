In middle and high schools analytic geometry refers to elementary methods in geometry of $n$-dimensional Euclidian space involving <em>coordinate calculations</em>; it is usually combined with linear algebra taught geometric way.

In research mathematics, when one says analytic geometry, analytic refers to analytic functions in the sense of Taylor expansion and by __analytic geometry__ one usually means the study of geometry of complex (holomorphic) manifolds, their analytic subsets, Stein domains and related notions. Similarly to an [[algebraic variety]], an analytic variety is locally given as a locus of a set of zeros of a finite family of holomorphic functions. A short survey can be found in a chapter of Dieudonne's <em>Panorama of pure mathematics</em>. 

In addition to the analytic geometry over complex numbers, there is also another formalism which allows even nonarchimedean ground rings. This is the subject of __rigid analytic geometry__. Similarly to schemes, rigid analytic varieties are glued from Bercovich spectra of certain commutative Banach algebras, so-called affinoids, in certain [[Grothendieck topology]]. There are several variants of the formalism (e.g. due Huber). The subject is closely related to formal geometry and has its main applications in arithmetic geometry and representation theory. It is an open problem to find an appropriate analogue of rigid analytic geometry in [[noncommutative geometry]], which is supposed to play an important role in mirror symmetry.
