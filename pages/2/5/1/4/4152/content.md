## Idea

*Hausdorff dimension* is a method of measuring the [[dimension]] of a [[metric space]].  It is always a non-[[negative number|negative]] [[real number]], but it need not be an [[integer]]; one way to define a [[fractal]] is a metric space with a fractional (non-integral) Hausdorff dimension. Hence Hausdorff dimension is an example of _[[fractal dimension]]_.

The Hausdorff dimension of the [[cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ (or any [[inhabited set|inhabited]] [[open subset]] thereof) is $n$.  The Hausdorff dimension of a self-similar fractal which consists of $n$ copies of itself reduced in size by a factor of $m$ is $\log_m n$.

In general, Hausdorff dimension may be defined using [[Hausdorff measure]].
