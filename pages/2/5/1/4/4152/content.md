Hausdorff dimension is a method of measuring the [[dimension]] of a [[metric space]].  It is always a non-negative [[real number]], but it need not be an [[integer]]; one way to define a [[fractal]] is a metric space with a fractional (non-integral) Hausdorff dimension.

The Hausdorff dimension of the [[cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ (or any [[inhabited set|inhabited]] [[open subset]] thereof) is $n$.  The Hausdorff dimension of a self-similar fractal which consists of $n$ copies of itself reduced in size by a factor of $m$ is $\log_m n$.

In general, Hausdorff dimension may be defined using [[Hausdorff measure]].  See [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_dimension#Formal_definition).
