There are several processes of acting on a [[category]] $C$ to give it certain properties in such a way that $C$ embeds as a [[subcategory]] of the new category, called a _completion_ of $C$:

* [[ideal completion]] of a category.
* [[profinite completion of a group|profinite completion]] of a discrete group (is this a case of profinite completion of a category, i.e., adding cofiltered limits?).
* ind-completion (should we say 'inductive completion'?) the "free cocompletion under filtered colimits" requiring all [[ind-object|ind-objects]].
* [[Cauchy complete category|Cauchy completion]] of an enriched category: addition of all absolute limits.
* [[free completion]] 
* [[free cocompletion]]
* [[exact completion]]

David: Are there (2)-functors forgetting various degrees of completeness with adjoints?

What happens in the $V$-enriched setting?
