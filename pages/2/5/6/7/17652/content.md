A [[polynomial]] $\phi$ over an [[integral domain]] $K$ (or equivalently a polynomial equation, which is the generality that one should consider if $K$ is only an integral cancellable [[rig]]) is __solvable__ if all of its roots in an [[algebraic closure]] (or any other sufficiently large [[splitting field]]) of $K$ are expressible using elements of $K$, the field operations, and extraction of roots.

The basic result of elementary [[Galois theory]] is that $\phi$ is solvable over $K$ if and only if its [[Galois group]] over $K$ is a [[solvable group]] (whence the name of the latter).
