
## In linear algebra

The term _adjoint_ originates in [[linear algebra]], where it may refer, in increasing generality, to:

* [[adjoint matrix]]

* [[Hermitian adjoint]]

* [[adjoint operator]]


## In category theory

In [[category theory]], the term "adjoint" foremost refers to "[[adjoint functors]]", a terminology which is probably inspired by the similarity between the characteristic [hom-isomorphism](adjoint+functor#InTermsOfHomIsomorphism) of such functors and the defining [[equality]] $\big\langle A v ,\, w \big\rangle
 \,=\, \big\langle v ,\, A^\dagger w \big\rangle$
for [[Hermitian adjoint]] [[linear operators]].

Proceeding from here, there are various variants of adjointness in [[category theory]]:

* [[adjunction]], [[adjoint morphism]]

* [[adjoint functor]]

  * [[strong adjoint functor]]

  * [[adjoint triple]], [[adjoint quadruple]], [[recollement]]

* [[proadjoint]], [[Hopf adjunction]]

* [[2-adjunction]]
  
  [[biadjunction]], [[lax 2-adjunction]], [[pseudoadjunction]]

* [[adjoint (infinity,1)-functor]]

* [[(âˆž,n)-category with adjoints]]
