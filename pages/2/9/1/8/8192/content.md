
## In category theory

The concept of _adjointness_ is central to [[category theory]].  It comes in many flavors:

* [[adjunction]], [[adjoint morphism]]

* [[adjoint functor]]

  * [[strong adjoint functor]]

  * [[adjoint triple]], [[adjoint quadruple]], [[recollement]]

* [[proadjoint]], [[Hopf adjunction]]

* [[2-adjunction]]
  
  [[biadjunction]], [[lax 2-adjunction]], [[pseudoadjunction]]

* [[adjoint (infinity,1)-functor]]

* [[(âˆž,n)-category with adjoints]]


## In linear algebra

The same term _adjoint_ is used in linear algebra with a completely different group of senses.  In increasing generality:

* [[adjoint matrix]]

* [[Hermitian adjoint]]

* [[adjoint operator]]


[[!redirects adjoints]]
