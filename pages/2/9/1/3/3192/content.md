A continuous linear operator $F:B_1\to B_2$ between Banach spaces is Fredholm if it has finite dimensional kernel and finite dimensional cokernel. It follows that its image (range) is closed. The difference between the dimensions of the kernel and the cokernel is called the **index** of the Fredholm operator

$$
ind F = dim ker F - dom coker F.
$$

A characterization: a bounded linear operator $F:B_1\to B_2$ between Banach spaces is Fredholm iff it there is an operator $T:B_2\to B_1$ which is its inverse up to a [[compact operator]], i.e. $FT - Id_{B_2}$ and $TF-Id_{B_1}$ are compact operators. 

Elliptic operators on compact manifolds are naturally Fredholm, as understood between the appropriate Sobolev spaces.
