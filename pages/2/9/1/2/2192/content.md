[[!redirects multigrade operators]]

A __multigrade operator__ $\Omega$ is a [[parametric operator]] with parameter $k$ in the set $\mathbb{N}$ of [[natural number|non-negative integers]].

The application of a multigrade operator $\Omega$ to a [[list|finite sequence]] of operands $(x_1, \ldots, x_k)$ is typically denoted with the parameter $k$ left tacit, as the appropriate application is implicit in the number of operands listed.  Thus $\Omega(x_1, \ldots, x_k)$ may be taken for $\Omega_k(x_1, \ldots, x_k).$
