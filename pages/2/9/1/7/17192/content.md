## Description

A noncommutative algebra $A$ is called the quantum/quantized coordinate ring if it is a deformation of a (commutative) coordinate ring of some affine or, in graded case, projective variety. The expression __quantized coordinate ring__ may be considered a synonym, but can also denote more generally a deformation of some other function algebra, say a $C^\ast$-algebra of functions on some compact Hausdorff topological space. Other good properties, e.g. being a Hopf algebra are often required.

Most often these terms are used in [[quantum group]] theory. If $G$ is an algebraic group, then its coordinate ring is usually denoted by $\mathcal{O}(G)$ or $Fun(G)$ and is a Hopf algebra. There is a pairing between $\mathcal{O}(G)$ and $U(g)$ where $g$ is the Lie algebra of $G$ hence the consideration of the function algebra is essentially dual to the consideration of the universal enveloping algebra $U(g)$ of $g$.
If $q$ is a deformation parameter, then there is a 1-parametric deformation $\mathcal{O}(G_q)$ (also denoted $\mathcal{O}_q(G)$) called the quantized function algebra on $G_q$ (or quantized coordinate ring of $G_q$) which is also a Hopf algebra. One considers $G_q$ as a quantum group; the approach via $\mathcal{O}(G_q)$ is dual to the approach via the quantized enveloping algebra $U_q(g)$.

Most well known approach to $\mathcal{O}(G_q)$ is the FRT construction
