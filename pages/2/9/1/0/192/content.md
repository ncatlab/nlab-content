_Set_ is a name for the category with [[set|sets]] as objects and [[function|functions]] between sets as morphisms.

This category has many marvelous properties, which make it a common choice for serving as a '[[foundations|foundation]]' of mathematics.  For instance:

* It is a [[topos]], and in particular it is [[locally cartesian closed category|locally cartesian closed]].
* It is [[locally small category|locally small]]
* It is [[complete category|complete]] and [[cocomplete category|cocomplete]], and therefore $\infty$-[[extensive category|extensive]] (as is any cocomplete topos).
* It is [[well-pointed topos|well-pointed]]

At least assuming [[classical logic]], these properties suffice to characterize $Set$ uniquely up to equivalence among all categories.  Note, however, that the definitions of "locally small" and "(co)complete" presuppose a notion of _small_ and therefore a knowledge of what a _set_ is.

It is usually assumed that $Set$ satisfies the [[axiom of choice]] and has a [[natural numbers object]].  In Lawvere's theory [[ETCS]], which can serve as a foundation for much of mathematics, $Set$ is asserted to be a well-pointed topos that satisfies the axiom of choice and has a natural numbers object.

Conversely, some [[constructive mathematics|constructivists]] do not even accept that $\Set$ is a topos; most would still agree that it is a [[locally cartesian closed category|locally cartesian closed]] [[pretopos]].  These people call themselves [[predicative mathematics|predicativists]].  They might also accept that $Set$ has [[projective object|enough projectives]] (but not the full axiom of choice), but some have rejected this too.
