_Set_ is a name for the category with [[set|sets]] as objects and [[function|functions]] between sets as morphisms.

This category has many marvelous properties, which make it a common choice for serving as a '[[foundations|foundation]]' of mathematics.  For instance:

* It is a [[topos]], and in particular it is [[locally cartesian closed category|locally cartesian closed]].
* It is [[locally small category|locally small]]
* It is [[complete category|complete]] and [[cocomplete category|cocomplete]], and therefore $\infty$-[[extensive category|extensive]] (as is any cocomplete topos).
* It is [[well-pointed category|well-pointed]]

At least assuming [[classical logic]], these properties suffice to characterize $Set$ uniquely up to equivalence among all categories.  Note, however, that the definitions of "locally small" and "(co)complete" presuppose a notion of _small_ and therefore a knowledge of what a _set_ is.

Many people als believe that $Set$ satisfies the [[axiom of choice]].  In Lawvere's theory [[ETCS]], which can serve as a foundation for much of mathematics, $Set$ is asserted to be a well-pointed topos with a [[natural number object]] satisfying the axiom of choice.
