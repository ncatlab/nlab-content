The notion of a normal subobject is the proper generalization of a normal subgroup to other algebraic categories. The notion has been found relatively late. In the category of groups, there are two equivalent descriptions of a normal subgroup: as the kernel of a morphism of groups and as the equivalence class of unit of some (necessarily unique) equivalence relation. 

Given a category $C$ admiting finite limits, one says that a morphism $f:X\to Y$ in $C$ is normal to the [[internal equivalence relation]] $r: R\hookrightarrowY\times Y$ if it factors through the monomorphism $r$ (i.e. $\exists \bar{f}$ such that $r\circ\bar{f}=f$ and ...


A normal subobject is a monomorphism which is normal to some equivalence relation.
