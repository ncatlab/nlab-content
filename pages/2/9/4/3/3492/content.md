## Idea

Many notions [[internalization|internal]] to a category $C$ (e.g.. [[internal groups]]) may be described instead in terms of [[functors]] ([[presheaves]], [[pseudofunctors]] etc.) with domain $C$, [[fibrations]] over $C$ and so on.  The process of replacing the internal structures on object or families of objects in $C$ by such "external"
structures involving the whole category $C$ is called the **externalization**. Sometimes external definitions give large versions (in the sense of set-theoretic size) of some internal notions. 

For example, a [[groupoid]] (or even a [[category]]) $G$ internal to a [[finitely complete category]] $C$ gives rise to a [[Grothendieck fibration]]. A Grothendieck fibration equivalent to an externalization of an [[internal category]] is called [[small fibration]].
