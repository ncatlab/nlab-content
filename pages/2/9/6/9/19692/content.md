
The __exterior__ of a [[subset]] of a [[topological space]] is the [[interior]] of its [[complement]], or equivalently the complement of its [[topological closure|closure]].  In more elementary terms, $x \in Ext A$ iff there is some [[neighbourhood]] of $x$ that is [[disjoint subsets|disjoint]] from $A$.
