
The __exterior__ of a [[subset]] of a [[topological space]] is the [[interior]] of its [[complement]], or equivalently the complement of its [[topological closure|closure]].  In more elementary terms, $x \in Ext A$ iff there is some [[neighbourhood]] of $x$ that is [[disjoint subsets|disjoint]] from $A$. 

The exterior operation applied to [[open sets]], i.e., to a [[topology]] $\mathcal{O}$ of a space, coincides with the [[negation]] operation $\neg: \mathcal{O} \to \mathcal{O}$ when we view $\mathcal{O}$ as a [[frame]] or [[Heyting algebra]]. See also [[regular open set]].
