## Idea

_D = 7 Seiberg-Witten theory_ (short _D = 7 SW_) is a transfer of [[Seiberg-Witten theory]] from [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian]] [[4-manifolds]] to [[G₂ manifolds]], which are [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian]] 7-manifolds with [[holonomy]] contained in [[G₂]], which leads to a canonical [[spinᶜ structure]].

## Description

For a [[G₂ manifold]], the [[structure group]] of its [[orientable]] [[tangent bundle]] can be lifted along $Spin(7)\twoheadrightarrow SO(7)$ (which is the case if and only if its second [[Stiefel-Whitney class]] vanishes) and then further reduced along the canonical inclusion $G_2\hookrightarrow Spin(7)$. With the canonical inclusion $Spin(7)\hookrightarrow Spin^\mathrm{c}(7)$, every $G_2$-manifold is canonically a spinᶜ manifold. In general, not all orientable 7-manifolds are spinᶜ manifolds, making the restriction to $G_2$-manifolds necessary. Since all [[orientable]] [[4-manifolds]] are spinᶜ manifolds, a similar restriction is not necessary in usual [[Seiberg-Witten theory]].
