An __operator algebra__ is any subalgebra of the algebra of continuous linear operators on a [[topological vector space]], with composition as the multiplication. In most cases, the space is a separable [[Hilbert space]], and most attention historically has been paid to algebras of bounded linear operators. The operator algebras themselves are often equipped with their own topologies (e.g. norm topology, weak topology, weak$^*$ topology and so on) and sometimes involution. __$C^*$-[[C-star algebra|algebras]]__ are (in the complex case) norm-closed complex $*$-subalgebras of the algebra of the bounded linear operators on a separable Hilbert space. They can be however characterized structurally as a $*$-representation of a [[Banach algebra]] with involution satisfying some compatibility conditions; the latter could be called abstract $C^*$-algebras (or sometimes $B^*$-algebras). Every _commutative_ unital $C^*$-algebra can be realized as an algebra of functions on a Hausdorff compact space, which is obtained as its [[Gel'fand spectrum]].

Special class of $C^*$-algebras are __[[von Neumann algebra|von Neumann]]__ or $W^*$-algebras (see [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_algebra)), which are (in the complex case) _weakly closed_ (closed in the weak topology) $*$-subalgebras of the algebra of bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space. In structural theory, an important role among von Neumann algebras is played by so-called factors, characterized by the property that their center is trivial ($1$-dimensional, consisting of "scalars"). 

Operator algebras play major roles in [[functional analysis]], [[representation theory]], [[noncommutative geometry]] and [[quantum field theory]].
