## Idea

In the [[standard model of particle physics]] the _top quark_ is the up-type [[quark]] in the third [[generation of fermions]]. 


It is the [[fundamental particle]] with by far the largest [[rest mass]] (after [[Higgs mechanism]]). This implies that top quark [[virtual particles]] in [[Feynman diagrams]] typically gives the dominant contribution to [[loop order|loop effects]] in [[perturbative quantum field theory|perturbative]] [[quantum observables]], notably in relation to the [[Higgs field]].
