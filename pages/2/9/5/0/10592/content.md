## Idea

In [[mathematics]], a *conjecture* is a [[proposition]] which is *expected* to be [[true]], hence expected to have a [[proof]], but for which no proof is (currently) known. 

Hence being a conjecture is a sociological aspect of a proposition, not a mathematical aspect: Once a proof (or else a [[counterexample]]) is found, the conjecture ceases to be a conjecture and instead becomes a [[theorem]].

It happens that conjectures remain unproven while being perceived as trustworthy enough that further [[theorems]] are proven *assuming* the conjectures -- in this case the conjecture plays the role of a [[hypothesis]] in the sense of [[formal logic]].

For example, the "[[standard conjectures]]" in [[algebraic geometry]] serve as hypotheses in a wealth of [[theorems]] which are all proven (only) "assuming the standard conjectures" (cf. e.g. [arXiv:9804123](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9804123)).

In other cases the term "[[hypothesis]]" is used synonymously with "conjecture" -- e.g. for the *[[homotopy hypothesis]]* (key cases of which have long become [[theorems]]) or the *[[cobordism hypothesis]]* (on which a proof has famously been claimed but not universally accepted).
