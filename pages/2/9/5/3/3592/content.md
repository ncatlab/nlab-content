An __alegbraic lattice__ is a [[complete lattice]] (or perhaps rather a [[suplattice]]? Or a [[poset]] with the [[property]] of arbitrary colimits but only the [[structure]] of directed colimits? Anyway, it has arbitrary joins, whatever the morphisms should be) in which every element is the [[supremum]] of the [[compact]] elements below it (an element $e$ is compact if, for every subset $S$ of the lattice, $e$ is less than or equal to the supremum of $S$ just in case $e$ is less than or equal to the supremum of some finite subset of $S$).
