## In abelian categories

A subcategory $T$ of an [[abelian category]] $A$ is __localizing__ if there exists an [[exact functor|exact]] localization functor $F:A\to B$ having a right adjoint $B\hookrightarrow A$ which is fully faithful and for which $T = Ker F$ i.e. the full subcategory of $A$ generated by objects $a\in Ob(A)$
such that $F(a) = 0$. 

One sometimes says that $T$ is the localizing subcategory associated with quotient (or localized) category $B$. A localizing subcategory $Ker F$ determines $F$ up to equivalence of categories commuting with the localization functors. Localizing subcategories are precisely those for which are topologizing, closed under extensions and closed under all colimits which exist in $A$. In other words, $A$ and $A''$ are in $T$ iff
any given extension $A'$ of $A$ by $A''$ is in $T$; and it is closed under colimits existing in $A$. 

## Localizing subcategories in $_R Mod$. 

There is a canonical correspondence between [[topologizing filter]]s of a unital ring and localizing subcategories in the category of (say left) unital modules of the ring.
