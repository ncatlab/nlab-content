The mathematical **red herring principle** is the principle that in mathematics, a "red herring" need not, in general, be either red or a herring.

Frequently, in fact, it is conversely true that all herrings are red herrings.  This often leads to mathematicians speaking of "non-red herrings," and sometimes even to a redefinition of "herring" to include both the red and non-red versions.

### Examples ###

* A [[manifold with boundary]] is not a [[manifold]].  This leads to the use of "manifold without boundary."

* A nonassociative algebra is not an algebra in the usual sense used in [[linear algebra]]. This leads to the use of "associative algebra". What\'s worse, a "nonassociative algebra" *might* happen to be associative; it just doesn\'t *have* to be!

* A noncommutative [[ring]] may or may not be a ring, depending on one's definition (algebraic geometers frequently take "ring" to imply commutativity).  Like a nonassociative algebra, a noncommutative ring might happen to be commutative.

  * Accordingly, [[noncommutative geometry]] is really about _not necessarily commutative_ or _possibly non-commutative_ geometry. In fact, many tools developed in "non-commutative geometry" are useful tools in just commutative geometry.

* A [[weak factorization system]] is not a factorization system, as originally defined.  This has led to the use of [[orthogonal factorization system]] in place of "factorization system."

* Originally, [[n-category]] referred only to the strict version, so that a "weak $n$-category" was not an $n$-category.  Nowadays some people (including many authors of the nLab)  are trying to reverse this, so that $n$-category means the weak version, while the strict version needs an adjective added.  Likewise for related concepts such as [[2-limit]] and [[strict 2-limit]].
