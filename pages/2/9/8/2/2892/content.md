A __dual equivalence__, or __antiequivalance__, between [[categories]] (or [[higher category theory|higher categories]]) $C$ and $D$ is simply an [[equivalence of categories|equivalence]] between one and the [[opposite category]] of the other.  It is usually most convenient to think of the equivalence as going from $C^{op}$ to $D$, as with a [[contravariant functor]] in general.

Many examples of abstract [[duality]] involve dual equivalences.
