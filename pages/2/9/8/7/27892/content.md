[[!redirects Fox pairings]]
## Idea

 The notion of a Fox pairing in a group algebra was intoduced by [[Gwénaël Massuyeau]], and [[Vladimir Turaev]], who used 
Fox pairings to define automorphisms of the Malcev completions of groups.
These automorphisms generalize to the algebraic setting the action of the
Dehn twists in the group algebras of the fundamental groups of surfaces

##Definition

By a Fox pairing in an augmented algebra, $A$, over a commutative ring $K$, we mean a $K$-
bilinear map $\eta : A \times A \to A$, which is a [[left Fox derivative]] with respect to the first
variable and a [[right Fox derivative]] with respect to the second variable. 

##Product formulae
 
The product formulae

$\eta(a_1a_2, b) = \eta(a_1, b) aug(a_2) + a_1\eta(a_2, b)$ for any $a_1$, $a_2$, $b\in A$;

and similarly,  

$\eta(a, b_1b_2) = \eta(a, b_1)b_2 + aug(b_1)\eta(a, b_2)$ for any $a$, $b_1$, $b_2 \in A$,
 
hold
