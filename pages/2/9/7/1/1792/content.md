## Idea ##

The suspension $S X$ of a [[topological space]] $X$ is a space of one higher dimension, which is (for [[inhabited set|inhabited]] $X$) a [[quotient object|quotient space]] of $X \times [0,1]$.  The difference between $S X$ and $X \times [0,1]$ is that the copy of $X$ at each endpoint ($0$ or $1$) is replaced by a single point.

Note that we *replace* $X$ by a single point at each endpoint; we don\'t merely *identify* all of the points in $X$ there.  This only makes a different for the [[empty space]]; we should have $S \empty = \{0,1\}$, not $S \empty = \empty$.  (This is related to the issues in the definition of [[connected space]].)
