### In point-set topology
 {#InPointSetTopology}

In [[point-set topology]], the (un-[[reduced suspension|reduced]]) *suspension* $\mathrm{S} X$ of an [[inhabited set|inhabited]] [[topological space]] $X$ is the [[quotient space]] of the [[cylinder]] space $X \times [-1,1]$ (the [[product space]] with a [[closed interval]]) by the relation which identifies all the points at either end:

\[
  \label{PointSetFormula}
  \mathrm{S}X
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \big(X \times [-1,1]\big)
  \;\big/\;
  \big(
    X\times \{-1,+1\} 
  \big)
  \,.
\]

In particular, the suspension of an [[n-sphere|$n$-sphere]] is [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to the $(n+1)$-sphere

$$
  S^{n+1} 
    \;\underset{\mathrm{homeo}}{\simeq}\; 
  \mathrm{S}(S^n)
  \,,
$$

namely the [[union]] of (in terms of the above graphics):

1. a north pole "$nth$"

1. a south pole "$sth$"

1. the [[meridians]] "$mer_x$" through all points $x \in S^{n}$ on the [[equator]].

Hence, by [[induction]], the $(n+1)$-sphere is homeomorphic to the $n+1$-fold suspension of the [[0-sphere]]:

$$
  S^{n+1} 
    \;\underset{\mathrm{homeo}}{\simeq}\; 
  \mathrm{S}^{n+1}(S^0)
  \,.
$$


### In homotopy theory
 {#InHomotopyTheory}

Regarded in the [[classical homotopy category]], the suspension construction (eq:PointSetFormula) on a [[CW-complex]] $X$ is a canonical model for the *[[suspension object]]* of the [[homotopy type]] represented by $X$ --- namely the [[homotopy pushout]] of the [[terminal object|terminal]] [[map]] $X \to \ast$ along itself) --- and as such plays a key role in [[homotopy theory]] and [[stable homotopy theory]].

This also explains the usual definition of the suspension of the [[empty space]] as the [[0-sphere]]

$$
  \mathrm{S}(\varnothing)
  \;=\;
  S^0
  \,,
$$

since the latter does model the [[homotopy pushout]] of $\varnothing \to \ast$ along itself (which is just a [[1-category]][[category theory|theoretic]] [[pushout]] and hence the [[coproduct]] of the [[point space]] with itself).

For more on this see at *[[suspension object]]*.

More precisely, what appears in most of [[algebraic topology]] and [[stable homotopy theory]] is the *[[reduced suspension]]* of [[pointed topological spaces]] $(X,x_0)$ (and eventually their [[suspension spectra]]):

$$
  \Sigma X \,\coloneqq\, \mathrm{S}X / \{x_0\}
  \,,
$$ 

where in addition the copy of the interval over the given basepoint is identified with a single point. For [[CW-complexes]] the [[reduced suspension]] is [[weak homotopy equivalence|weakly homotopy equivalent]] to the ordinary suspension.

In this context of ([[stable homotopy theory|stable]]) [[homotopy theory]], the suspension construction is part of the canonical [[point-set topology|point-set]] model for [[cofiber sequences]] induced from any [[mapping cone]] construction:

## Definitions

Let $X$ be a [[space]] (such as a [[topological space]], or something more interesting like a [[generalized smooth space]]).  Let $I$ be the unit [[interval]] $[0,1]$ in the [[real line]]; let $2$ be the $2$-point [[discrete space]] $\{\bot,\top\}$.  Let $X \times I \times 2$ be the [[cartesian product]] of $X$, $2$, and $I$; let $X + (X \times 2 \times I) + 2$ be the [[disjoint union]] of $X$, $X \times I \times 2$ and $2$.  We will suppress reference to the inclusion maps into $X + (X \times I) + 2$; it will be clear from context how to parse an element of the latter.


### Generalisable definition

The __suspension__ $S X$ of $X$ is the [[quotient space]] of $X + (X \times I \times 2) + 2$ by the [[equivalence relation]] $\sim$ generated by:

*  $a \sim (a,0,\bot)$ for $a$ in $X$;
*  $a \sim (a,0,\top)$ for $a$ in $X$;
*  $(a,1,\bot) \sim \bot$ for $a$ in $X$;
*  $(a,1,\top) \sim \top$ for $a$ in $X$.


### Generalisation: the join

This generalises immediately to an operation called the _[[join of topological spaces|join]]_ $X \star Y$ of two spaces $X$ and $Y$; this is the quotient space of $X + (X \times I \times Y) + Y$ by the equivalence relation generated by:

*  $a \sim (a,0,b)$ for $a$ in $X$ and $b$ in $Y$;
*  $(a,1,b) \sim b$ for $a$ in $X$ and $b$ in $Y$.

(Compare [[join of simplicial sets]] and [[join of topological spaces]], the same operation in another guise.)  Then we have $S X = X \star 2$.


### Simplified definition

It is somewhat simpler to define $S X$ as the quotient space of $(X \times I) + 2$ by the equivalence relation generated by:

*  $(a,0) \sim \bot$ for $a$ in $X$;
*  $(a,1) \sim \top$ for $a$ in $X$.

This works to define a topological space, but it does not directly give the smooth structure that matches the picture above.


### Further simplified for pointed spaces

If $X$ has a point $p$, hence if it is [[inhabited set|inhabited]], then we can define $S X$ as the quotient space of $X \times I$ by the equivalence relation generated by:

*  $(a,0) \sim (b,0)$ for $a, b$ in $X$;
*  $(a,1) \sim (b,1)$ for $a, b$ in $X$.

This is probably the most common definition seen, but it only works for $X$ an inhabited space (and even then gives only the topological structure).

### Reduced suspension

To make the suspension of a [[pointed space]] $(X,p)$ again a [[pointed space]] one may further collapse in $S X$ the set $\{p\} \times I$ to the point. The result then is called the _[[reduced suspension]]_ of $(X,p)$ and is denoted 

$$
  \Sigma X \coloneqq
  S X / \{p \} \times I
  \simeq
  X \times I / \left(
    X \times \{0,1\}
    \cup
    \{p\} \times I
  \right)
  \,.
$$

## Properties

### As a functor

It\'s easy to extend the suspension operation $S$ to a [[functor]] from [[Top]] to itself.

### Relation between suspension and reduced suspension

For [[CW-complexes]] suspension and [[reduced suspension]] agree, up to [[weak homotopy equivalence]].

### Cogroup structure

In the pointed case ([[reduced suspension]]): [[suspensions are H-cogroup objects]]

## Examples

### Suspension of cubes

The suspension of the $n$-[[cube]] is the $(n+1)$-cube, probably best visualised as a diamond.  This gives a [[recursion|recursive]] definition of cube, starting with the $0$-cube as the [[point]], which is not the suspension of anything.  Note that this not only gives us the [[topological structure]] of the cube, but also (by working in an appropriate [[category]] of [[smooth spaces]] throughout) the correct [[smooth structure]] on the cube as a [[manifold with corners]].  You can probably even get the correct [[metric space|metric]] on the cube (normalised to have diagonals of length $1$) automatically by using a more complicated quotienting process.

### Suspension of spheres

Up to [[homeomorphism]], the suspension of the $n$-[[sphere]] is the $(n+1)$-sphere, and the [[reduced suspension]] is 

$$
  \Sigma S^n \simeq S^{n+1}
  \,.
$$

See at _[one-point compactification -- Examples -- Spheres](one-point+compactification#ExamplesSpheres)_ for details.

Notice that the $n$-sphere is (topologically) the [[boundary]] of the $(n+1)$-cube.  The coincidence that 'sphere' and 'suspension' both begin with 's' has not been ignored; we can write $S^n \cong S^n(2)$, where $S^n$ on the left is the $n$-sphere and $S^n$ on the right is the $n$-fold [[composite]] of the suspension functor.  (Actually, you should start with the $(-1)$-sphere as the [[empty space]], which is not the suspension of anything; then the $0$-sphere is $S \empty = 2$.)  However, this does not give the correct smooth structure on the sphere, unless perhaps there is some more sophisticated definition that fixes this (but then that would break the cube).  It might be more appropriate to say that the suspension of the $n$-[[globe]] is the $(n+1)$-globe.

### Suspension of simplices

Up to topological structure, the suspension of the $n$-[[simplex]] is the $(n+1)$-simplex, but now this is not very useful.  To study simplices, you should use the __cone__ functor instead, which is $\Lambda X = X \star 1$, where $1$ is the [[point]].
