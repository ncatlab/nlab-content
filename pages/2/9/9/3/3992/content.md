## Idea

In a [[monoidal category]] $(C, \otimes, I)$, the **unit object** (or _[[tensor unit]]_) $I$ is [[generalized the|the]] [[object]] which plays the role of the unit for the [[tensor product]] $\otimes$, in that for any other object $a$ there are [[isomorphism]] $a \otimes I \simeq a$ and $I \otimes a \simeq a$ (the [[unitors]]).

Dually, in a [[closed category]] there is a _unit object_ which is such that maps out of it into an [[internal hom]] correspond to the external hom.
