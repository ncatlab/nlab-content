## Statement

Recall that a [[topological space]] $X$ is [[metacompact space|metacompact]] if every open cover has a point-finite open refinement which covers $X$. Further a space is called [[Lindelöf topological space|Lindelöf]] if every [[open cover]] has a [[countable cover|countable]] sub-cover. 

\begin{theorem}
Assuming the law of [[excluded middle]]:

Every [[separable space|separable]] metacompact [[topological space]] $X$ is Lindelöf .
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
If $\{U_i\}_{i\in I}$ is an open cover with no countable subcover, let $\{U_j\}_{j\in J}$ be a point finite refinement. Then $\{U_j\}_{j\in J}$ is uncountable and so some point of the countable dense set is in $U_j$ for uncountably many $j \in J$.
\end{proof}
