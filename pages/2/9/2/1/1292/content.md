A [[full subcategory]] of an [[abelian category|abelian]] (or [[triangulated category|triangulated]]) category is __thick__ if it is closed under [[extension]]s. for some authors, this term denotes the stronger notion of a [[topologizing subcategory]] which is closed under extensions; for others the latter version is called a [[Serre subcategory]] (in a weak sense).

For any subcategory of an abelian category $A$ one denotes by $\bar{T}$ the full subcategory of $A$ generated by all objects $N$ for which any (nonzero) [[subquotient]] of $N$ in $T$
has a (nonzero) [[subobject]] from $T$. This becomes an idempotent operation on the class of subcategories of $A$ with $T\subset \bar{T}$ iff $T$ is [[topologizing subcategory|topologizing]].
Moreover $\bar{T}$ is always thick in the stronger sense.
[[Serre subcategory|Serre subcategories]] in the stronger sense are those subcategories which are stable under the operation $\bar{}$.
