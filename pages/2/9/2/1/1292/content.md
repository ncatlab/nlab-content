A [[full subcategory]] of an abelian (or triangulated)  category is __thick__ if it is closed under extensions. for some authors, thick subcategory denotes a stronger notion of a [[topologizing subcategory]] which is closed under extensions (for others the latter version is called [[Serre subcategory]] (in a weak sense)).

For any subcategory of an abelian category $A$ one denotes by $\bar{T}$ the full subcategory of $A$ generated by all objects $N$ for which that any (nonzero) subquotient of $N$ in $T$
has a (nonzero) subobject from $T$, This becomes an idempotent operation on the class of subcategories of $A$ with $T\subset \bar{T}$ iff $T$ is [[topologizing subcategory|topologizing]].;
moreover $\bar{T}$ is always thick in the stronger sense.
[[Serre subcategory|Serre subcategories]] in stronger sense are those subcategories which are stable under operation $\bar{}$.
