## Definition

A [[full subcategory|full]] [[triangulated subcategory]] is __thick__ (or __&#233;paisse__) if it is closed under [[extension]]s. 

Sometimes the same definition is used in [[abelian categories]] as well. However, for many authors, including [[Pierre Gabriel]], in abelian categories, this term denotes the stronger notion of a [[topologizing subcategory]] closed under extensions; in other words, a nonempty full subcategory $T$ of an abelian category $A$ is  __thick__ (in strong sense) iff with all objects contains all its subquotients and all extensions, i.e. for every exact sequence 
$$
0 \longrightarrow M\longrightarrow M''\longrightarrow M'\longrightarrow 0
$$
in $A$, the object $M''$ is in $T$ iff $M$ and $M'$ are in $T$.

For some authors the thick subcategory (strong version) is called a [[Serre subcategory]] (in a weak sense), the term which we reserve for (generally) a stronger notion. 

For any subcategory of an abelian category $A$ one denotes by $\bar{T}$ the full subcategory of $A$ generated by all objects $N$ for which any (nonzero) [[subquotient]] of $N$ in $T$
has a (nonzero) [[subobject]] from $T$. This becomes an idempotent operation on the class of subcategories of $A$ where $T\subset \bar{T}$ iff $T$ is [[topologizing subcategory|topologizing]].
Moreover $\bar{T}$ is always thick in the stronger sense.
[[Serre subcategory|Serre subcategories]] in the strong sense are those (nonempty) subcategories which are stable under the operation $T\mapsto\bar{T}$.
