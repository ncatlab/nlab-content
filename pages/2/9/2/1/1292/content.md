## Definition in (pre)triangulated categories

A non-[[empty category|empty]] [[full subcategory|full]] (pre-)[[triangulated subcategory]] $T$ is called _thick_ (or __&#233;paisse__) if it is "closed under [[direct summands]]" (e.g. [Murayama, Def. 11](#Murayama), see [Stacks Project, Def. 13.6.1](#StacksProject05RA)). In other words, if $M\oplus N$ is isomorphic to an object in $T$ then both $M$ and $N$ are isomorphic to objects in $T$.

## In abelian categories

A nonempty full subcategory $T$ of an [[abelian category]] $A$ is  __thick__ (in the strong sense) if for every exact sequence 
$$
0 \longrightarrow M\longrightarrow M''\longrightarrow M'\longrightarrow 0
$$
in $A$, the object $M''$ is in $T$ iff $M$ and $M'$ are in $T$.

In words, it is an [[additive category|additive]] [[full subcategory]] closed under subobjects, quotients and extensions (e.g. [Dichev 2009](#Dichev09) and [[Pierre Gabriel]] in [[Des Catégories Abéliennes]]). 

In any abelian category all subobjects are [[kernels]] of [[epimorphisms]]; and all quotients are [[cokernels]] of [[monomorphisms]].

Another way to pack the same definition is that thick subcategory of an abelian category is a [[topologizing subcategory]] closed under extensions. 

#### Remarks on terminology in abelian context

For some authors the thick subcategory is also called a _[[Serre subcategory]]_ (in a weak sense), the term which we reserve for (generally) a stronger notion. 

For any subcategory of an [[abelian category]] $A$ one denotes by $\bar{T}$ the full subcategory of $A$ generated by all objects $N$ for which any (nonzero) [[subquotient]] of $N$ in $T$ has a (nonzero) [[subobject]] from $T$. This becomes an idempotent operation on the class of subcategories of $A$ where $T\subset \bar{T}$ iff $T$ is [[topologizing subcategory|topologizing]].
Moreover $\bar{T}$ is always thick in the stronger sense.
[[Serre subcategory|Serre subcategories]] in the strong sense are those (nonempty) subcategories which are stable under the operation $T\mapsto\bar{T}$. In full generality this is a bit
stronger than thick subcategory and the two senses agree if the ambient category is a full category of modules.

## Serre quotient category

Following the extensions of an early work of Serre by Grothendieck and Gabriel, for any thick subcategory $T$ in an [[abelian category]] $A$, one defines the (Serre) quotient category $A/T$ as the one having the same [[objects]] as $A$ and [[hom-sets]] given by

$$
  (A/T)(X,Y) := colim A(X',Y/Y')
$$

where the [[colimit]] runs through all [[subobjects]] $X'\subset X$, $Y'\subset Y$ such that $X/X' \in Ob T$, $Y'\in Ob T$. 

It remains to define bilinear composition laws:
$$
Hom_{A/T}(M, N)\times Hom_{A/T}(N, P)\longrightarrow Hom_{A/T}(M,P).
$$

> For this, let $\overline{f}$ be an element of $Hom_{A/T}(M, N)$ and let $\overline{g}$ be an element of
$Hom_{A/T}(N, P)$. The element $\overline{f}$ is the image of a morphism $f: M'\to N/N'$ where $M/M'$ and $N'$ are objects of $T$. Similarly, $\overline{g}$ is the image of a morphism $g:N'\to P/P'$, where $N/N'$ and $P'$ are objects of $T$. If $M''$ designates the inverse image
$f^{-1}((N''+N')/N')$, it is easy to see that $M/M''$ belongs to $T$; we denote by $f'$ the morphism from $M''$ to $(N''+N')/N'$ which is induced by $f$. Likewise, $g(N''\cap N')$ is an object of $T$; if $P''$ denotes the sum $P'+g(N''\cap N')$, it is easy to see that $P''$ belongs to $T$; we denote $g'$ the morphism of $N''/(N''\cap N')$ in $P/P''$ which is induced by $g$.

> Let $h$ be the composition of $f'$, of the canonical isomorphism of $(N''+ N')/N'$ on $N''/(N''\cap N')$ and $g'$,
$$
  M'' \overset{f^'}\longrightarrow (N''+N')/N' \overset{can}\longrightarrow N''/(N''\cap N')\overset{g^'}\longrightarrow P/P''.
$$ 
The image $\overline{h}$ of $h$ in $Hom_{A/T}(M, P)$ depends only on $\overline{f}$ and $\overline{g}$ and not on $f$ and $g$. It is therefore justified to define the composition in $A/T$ by equality $\overline{g}\circ\overline{f} = \overline{h}$. These composition laws are bilinear; they make $A/T$ a category.

(adapted from Gabriel, [[Des Catégories Abéliennes]], III.1)

The quotient functor $Q \colon A\to A/T$ is obvious. 

Notice that the set of morphisms is indeed [[small set|small]], so that the Serre quotient category exists as a [[locally small category]]. On the other hand, one can construct an equivalent [[localization]] by the Gabriel-Zisman  localizing at the class $\Sigma$ of all morphisms
whose kernel and cokernel are in $T$. Although 
$\Sigma$ admits the [[calculus of fractions]], 
this method does not guarantee the existence in general. 

A basic example is the quotient of the category of abelian groups modulo the torsion groups. This category is equivalent to the category of $\mathbb{Q}$-vector spaces, by the functor which maps an abelian group $M$ to the scalar extension $M \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} \mathbb{Q}$. (See the [Stacks Project, Tag 0B0J](http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0B0J) for a proof.)

### Localizing subcategories

A thick subcategory (here always in the strong sense) is said to be [[localizing subcategory|localizing]] if $T$ is thick and the Serre quotient functor $Q$ admits a right adjoint $A/T\to A$, often called the __section functor__. In other words $A/T$ is then a reflective subcategory of $A$. Every coreflective thick subcategory $T$ admits a section functor, and the converse holds if $A$ has injective envelopes. A thick subcategory $T\subset A$ is a coreflective iff $(T,F)$ is a [[torsion theory]] where

$$
F \coloneqq \{X\in Ob A\,|\,A(T,X) = 0\}
$$

## Thick subcategories and saturation

Recall that a class $\Sigma$ of morphisms with category of fractions $\mathcal{C}_\Sigma$ is called _saturated_ if $\Sigma$ coincides with the class of morphisms inverted by the canonical functor $\mathcal{C}\to \mathcal{C}_\Sigma$.

Let $A$ be an abelian category, $T$ be a thick subcategory in the strong sense and let $\Sigma_T$ be the class of morphisms in $A$ such that their kernel and cokernel are in $T$. Then $\Sigma_T$ has a right and a left calculus of fractions and is saturated for the canonical functor $p:A\to A/T$. Furthermore, $p$ maps to zero objects precisely the objects in $T$.

Conversely, let $\Sigma$ be a saturated class of morphisms of $A$ with a calculus of fractions on the right and on the left. Then the full subcategory on the objects that are mapped to zero by the canonical $p:A\to A_\Sigma$ is thick. In other words, there is a bijection between thick subcategories in the strong sense and saturated classes of morphisms with a calculus of fractions on the right and on the left.
