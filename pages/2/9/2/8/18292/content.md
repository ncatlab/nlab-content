## Idea

Arithmetic (Greek &#7936;&#961;&#953;&#952;&#956;&#972;&#962;: number) is, roughly speaking, the study of [[numbers]] in their various forms, and the structure and properties of the operations defined on them, including at least [[addition]] and [[multiplication]], and sometimes also [[subtraction]], [[division]], and [[exponentiation]]. 

Notions of "[[number]]" are very broad and not at all easy to encapsulate. There are [[natural numbers]], [[integers]], [[rational numbers]], [[real numbers]], and [[complex numbers]], [[quaternions]] (Hamiltonian numbers), [[octonions]] (Cayley numbers). There are [[dual numbers]] and [[hyperbolic numbers]],  and [[geometric algebra]]s 
(geometric numbers). There are [[cyclic group#Ring structure|integers modulo $n$]]. There are [[algebraic numbers]] and [[algebraic integers]], and individual [[fields]] of such ([[number fields]]). There are $p$-[[adic numbers]]. Then there are [[cardinal numbers]], [[ordinal numbers]], and [[surreal numbers]]. For each one of these one can (and does!) speak of its arithmetic.
