## Idea

A [[field theory]] is called *non-Lagrangian* if it can not be described using a [[Lagrangian density]]. This is in contrast to *[[Lagrangian field theories]]*.

## Examples

\begin{example}
A basic example of non-Lagrangian field theories used to be [[self-dual higher gauge theories]]: Superficially, these would be supposed to have higher [[Maxwell theory]]-type Lagrangian densities of the form $H_{2k+1} \wedge \star H_{2k+1}$, but if the self-duality constraint $\star H_{2k+1} = H_{2k+1}$ is imposed beforehand, then this expression vanishes identically instead of inducing the expected [[Euler-Lagrange equations|Euler-Lagrange]] [[equations of motion]].

This issue concerns already the [[Green-Schwarz sigma model]] for the single (abelian) [[M5-brane]] and even more so the would-be theory of coincident [[M5-branes]], involving a [[D=6 N=(2,0) SCFT]] with a nonabelian ([[higher gauge theory|higher]]) [[gauge field]].

However, more complicated Lagrangians have been found ([Pasti, Sorokin & Tonin 1997](M5-brane#PST97), [Sen 2020](#self-dual+higher+gauge+theory#Sen20)) whose [[equations of motion]] do reproduce at least the abelian self-dual fields, and at least if one is willing to disregard some decoupled [[auxiliary fields]], illustrating that the question of whether or not a "field theory" is or is not Lagrangian may require further specification to be well-defined.
\end{example}
