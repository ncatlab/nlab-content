## Idea

For a [[small category]] $S$, just as the [[presheaf category]]  $Set^{S^{op}}$ is the [[free cocompletion]] of $S$, by [[formal duality]] the [[opposite category]] $(Set^S)^{op}$ of the category of presheaves on $S^{op}$ is the **free completion** of $S$.  

This means that any [[functor]] $S\to C$ where $C$ is [[complete category|complete]] factors uniquely (up to [[isomorphism]]) through the "opposite [[Yoneda embedding]]" $S\to (Set^S)^{op}$ via a [[continuous functor]] $(Set^S)^{op}\to C$.

## Properties

The operation of completion is a [[2-monad]] which is [[colax idempotent 2-monad|colax idempotent]] but not (even weakly) [[idempotent monad|idempotent]].  In analogy with the general concept of [[completion]], we might call the operation of *any* colax idempotent monad on a $2$-category a 'free completion'.  See discussion at [[completion]].
