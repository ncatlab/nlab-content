**Dmitry Tamarkin** is a mathematician (with some training in theoretical physics as well) at Northwestern University. His expertise includes  deformation theory (with his famous proof of Kontsevich's formality theorem), [[D-modules]], [[homological algebra]], symplectic geometry, microlocal analysis and various strong homotopy algebras ($A_\infty$, $L_\infty$, $G_\infty$...). His advisor was [[Boris Tsygan]]. See also [[noncommutative differential calculus]] and [[microlocal category]].
