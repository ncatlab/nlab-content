## Idea

For $f : X \to Y$ a [[morphism]] of [[site]]s such that the corresponding [[derived functor|derived]] [[direct image]] $f_*$ and [[inverse image]] functor $f^*$ on the [[derived category]] of [[abelian sheaf cohomology|abelian]] [[sheaves]]
are related to a further [[adjoint functor]] pair $(f_! \dashv f^!)$.

These together with the _internal_ [[Ext]] and [[Tor]] functors are often called **Grothendieck's six operations**. There is a rich calculus induced by this structure.
