## Idea

### General

What is known as _(Grothendieck's) six operations_ is a formalization of structure that 

* assigns to every [[morphism]] $f$ of suitable [[spaces]] a ([[derived direct image|derived]])[[direct image]]/([[derived inverse image|derived]])[[inverse image]] [[adjunction]] $(f^\ast \dashv f_*)$;

* assigns to every [[separated morphism]] a [[direct image with compact support]]/[[Verdier duality|Verdier dual]] [[adjunction]] $(f_! \dashv f^!)$.

These are _four operations_ and together with

* a [[closed monoidal category|closed]] [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal]] [[tensor product]]/[[internal hom]] [[adjunction]] $((-)\otimes X \dashv [X,-])$ 

form _six operations_. 

(All this is usually interpreted as [[derived functors]]/[[(infinity,1)-functors]] so that for instance in the usual application to [[derived categories]] of [[abelian sheaves]] the last two operations are really [[Tor]] and [[Ext]].) 

With a list of compatibility conditions between these (for instance ([Cisinski-D&#233;glise 09, p. x](#CisinskiDeglise09)) this is a structure of _Grothendieck's six operations_.


These consistency conditions include the following:

1. The adjunctions are functorial, hence form [[2-functors]] $f \mapsto f_*$, $f \mapsto f_!$:

1. There is a [[natural transformation]]  $f_! \to f_*$ which is a [[natural equivalence]] when $f$ is a [[proper map]]. 

1. [[Beck-Chevalley condition]] (base change formulas): given a ([[homotopy pullback|homotopy]]) [[pullback]] [[diagram]]

   $$
     \array{
       && Q_1 \underset{X}{\times} Q_2
       \\
       & {}^{\mathllap{p_1}}\swarrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{p_2}}
       \\
       Q_1 && && Q_2
       \\
       & {}_{\mathllap{f}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{g}}
       \\
       && X
     }
   $$

   such that $f$ is a [[separated morphism]], then there are [[natural equivalences]]

   $$
     g^\ast \circ f_! \simeq (p_2)_! \circ (p_1)^\ast
   $$

   $$
     f^! \circ g_\ast \simeq (p_1)_\ast\circ (p_2)^!
     \,. 
   $$

Morover one imposes a formalization of [[Verdier duality]] with [[dualizing object]]...

([Cisinski-D&#233;glise 09, p. xi](#CisinskiDeglise09))


### Specializations

Often specializations of the general concept play a role:

* [[Wirthm√ºller context]]: $f^! \simeq f^\ast$ and $f^\ast$ is a strong [[closed monoidal functor]] (hence the [[projection formula]] for $f_!$ holds);

  * [[transfer context]]: in addition the [[projection formula]] for $f_\ast$ holds;

* [[Verdier-Grothendieck context]]: the "projection formula" $Y \otimes f_! X \simeq f_!(f^\ast Y \otimes X)$ holds naturally in $X,Y$:

* [[Grothendieck context]]: $f_! \simeq f_\ast$ and the projection formula holds $Y \otimes f_! X \simeq f_!(f^\ast Y \otimes X)$.

## Mann's approach

Mann ([Mann22](#Mann22)) has developed an abstract framework for a six-functor formalism that combines the approaches of Liu-Zheng and Gaitsgory-Rozenblyum and applies it to [[rigid analytic geometry]], in particular in combination with [[condensed mathematics]] and [[almost mathematics]] to construct an [[$\infty$-category]] of derived solid $\mathcal{O}_{X}^{+}/\pi$ almost modules (see also [Scholze22](#Scholze22)).

\begin{definition}
Let $C$ be an $\infty$-category admitting finite limits and let $E$ be a class of morphisms stable under pullback and composition, and including all isomorphisms. The symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category of correspondences $\mathrm{Corr}(C,E)$ has as its objects the objects in $C$, and has as its morphisms the correspondences in $C$, i.e. for objects $X$ and $Y$ of $C$ a morphism from $X$ to $Y$ is given by an object $W$ of $C$ together with maps

  $$
    \array{
      && W
      \\
      & \swarrow_{f} && \searrow_{g}
      \\
      X &&&& Y
    }
  $$

where $g\inE$. The symmetric monoidal structure comes from the one on $C$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
Let $\mathrm{Cat}_{\infty}$ be the $\infty$-category of $\infty$-categories. A *3-functor formalism* is a lax symmetric monoidal functor
$$\mathcal{D}:\mathrm{Corr}(C,E)\to \mathrm{Cat}_{\infty}$$
\end{definition}

The above definition formalizes three of the functors in the 6-functor formalism. The derived tensor product comes from the lax symmetric monoidal structure, $f^{*}$ comes from the image of the correspondence $Y\xleftarrow{f}X=X$, and $f_{!}$ comes from the image of the correspondence $X=X\xrightarrow{f}Y$.

\begin{definition}
A *6-functor formalism* is a 3-functor formalism for which $-\otimes A$, $f^{*}$, and $f_{!}$ admit right adjoints.
\end{definition}

## Properties

### Relation to motivic homotopy theory

The [[initial object]] in the [[(infinity,2)-category]] of functors to [[stable (infinity,1)-categories]] which satisfy the _six  operations_ formalism (and a bit more, such that [[motivic homotopy theory|A1-homotopy invariance]]) is _[[stable motivic homotopy theory]]_. See there for more.
