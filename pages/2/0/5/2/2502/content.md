## Idea

A [[super Lie algebra]] extension of a [[Poincare Lie algebra]]. 

The corresponding [[super Lie group]] is the [[super Euclidean group]] (except for the signature of the metric).


## Cohomology

The super Poincareacute; Lie algebra has, on top of the [[Lie algebra cohomology|Lie algebra cocycles]] that it inherits from $\mathfrak{so}(n)$, a discrete number of special cocycles bilinear in the spinors, on the super translation algebra, that exist only in very special dimensions.

For the statement of the following theorem, we use the relation between [[division algebra and supersymmetry]], as described there.

**Theorem**

* In dimensional $d =  3,4,6, 10$, $\mathfrak{siso}(d-1,1)$ has a nontrivial 3-cocycle given by

  $$
    (\psi, \phi, A) \mapsto g(\psi \cdot \phi, A)
  $$

  for spinors $\psi, \phi \in \mathcal{S}$ and vectors $A \in \mathcal{T}$, and 0 otherwise.

* In dimensional $d =  4,5,7, 11$, $\mathfrak{siso}(d-1,1)$ has a nontrivial 4-cocycle given by

  $$
    (\Psi, \Phi, \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B}) \mapsto 
    \langle \Psi , (\mathcal{A}\mathcal{B}- \mathcal{B} \mathcal{A})\Phi \rangle
  $$

  for spinors $\Psi, \Phi \in \mathcal{S}$ and vectors $\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B} \in \mathcal{V}$, with the commutator taken in the Clifford algebra.

The 4-cocycle in $d = 11$ is the one that induces the [[supergravity Lie 3-algebra]].
