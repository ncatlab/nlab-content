##Â Idea

It is a well-known fact in [[computability]] that it is not possible to write a decision procedure that tells whether another program is terminating or not. This fact is know as the [[halting theorem]].

For this reason most [[functional programming]] languages are endowed with an unrestricted [[fixed-point operator]] at all [[types]], which simplifies the implementation of the language, but allows the user to write functions that are not-well defined mathematically. 

Inspired by [[category theory]], a _recursion scheme_ is a structured [[recursion]] operator that ensures that the definitions of [[recursive]] functions are well-defined. 

For example, 

1. A [[catamorphism]] (a.k.a. a fold) is the unique $F$-algebra homomorphism from an [[initial algebra]] for the functor $F$.

2. An [[anamorphism]] (a.k.a.  unfold) is the unique $G$-coalgebra homomorphism into the [[final coalgebra]] for the functor $G$.

3. An [[hylomorphism]] corresponds to the idea of a recursive coalgebra or [[well-founded coalgebra]]. In words, a recursive $F$-coalgebra $(c, X)$ has a unique mapping $f : X \to Y$ into any other $F$-algebra $(Y, a)$ such that $f = a \circ F(f) \circ c$.

A hylomorphism gives a simple example of an opportunity for optimization: an anamorphism builds up a tree structure and a catamorphism consumes it, so if this hylomorphism structure is recognized in the program, then an implementation need not build the intermediate tree, and so the [[computational complexity|space usage]] of the program can be reduced.

## Recursion Schemes via Adjunctions

Catamorphisms and their variants are basic and rather restricted forms of recursion, i.e. where the recursive call is called on smaller input. 

Many other patterns of recursion exists that are equally well-defined, but they cannot be expressed *directly* in terms of catamorphisms. However, most recursion schemes are adjoint folds ([Hinze, Wu and Gibbons, 2013](#HinzeWG13)), i.e. every complex recursion scheme can be reduced to a basic one via an adjunction. Moreover,  *every* recursion scheme is an instance of a conjugate hylomorphism ([Hinze, Wu and Gibbons, 2015](#HinzeWG15)) .

A comprehensive list of recursion schemes can be found in [Yang and Wu, 2022](#YangW22)
