While for manifolds there is a [[Poincare duality|Poincar√© duality]] relating homology and cohomology, it fails for singular spaces. One can extend the idea of duality by taking into account (co)dimensions of singular strata. This idea can be concretized in a definition of **intersection cohomology** which has an additional parameter called **perversity**. In two special cases of perversity, it boils down to either homology or cohomology; thus some call it intersection homology. Main applications are in study of topology of singular spaces and in [[geometric representation theory]]. In particular properties of intersection of cycles of various codimension, including transversality are neatly accounted for.
