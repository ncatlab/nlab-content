## Idea

The _free category_ on a "set of arrows", hence on a [[directed graph]], is the ([[strict category|strict]]) [[category]] whose: 

* [[objects]] are the [[vertices]] of the graph,

* [[morphisms]] are the [[tuples]] of [[composition|composable]] [[edges]], hence the morphisms [[free construction|freely generated]] from these (directed) edges. 

  These morphisms may also be thought of as the "paths" traced out in the directed graph by traversing stepwise along its  [[edges]], whence free categories are also called *[[path categories]]*.

{#MorePrecisely} More formally, there is a [[forgetful functor]] $U_{Cat}$ from the [[1-category]] [[Cat|$Cat^{strct}_{smll}$]] of [[small categories|small]] [[strict categories]] (and [[functors]] between them) to that of [[directed graphs]] (assigning the [[underlying]] graph of morphisms, i.e. forgetting the [[composition]]-operation); and the free category construction is its [[left adjoint]] [[free construction]] $F_{Cat}$:

$$
  Cat^{strct}_{smll}
  \underoverset
    {\underset{U_{Cat}}{\longrightarrow}}
    {\overset{F_{Cat}}{\longleftarrow}}
    {\;\;\bot\;\;\;}
  DiGrph
$$

{#FreeGroupoid} Often this is considered in [[composition]] with the "localization" functor that constructs the [[free groupoid]] on a given category:

$$
  Grpd^{strct}_{smll}
  \underoverset
    {\underset{U_{Grpd}}{\longrightarrow}}
    {\overset{F_{Grpd}}{\longleftarrow}}
    {\;\;\bot\;\;\;}
  Cat^{strct}_{smll}
  \underoverset
    {\underset{U_{Cat}}{\longrightarrow}}
    {\overset{F_{Cat}}{\longleftarrow}}
    {\;\;\bot\;\;\;}
  DiGrph
$$

(which relates to the [[Milnor construction]], see [Goerss & Jardine (2009), V.7](Dwyer-Kan+loop+groupoid#GoerssJardine09))

Since the perspective on categories as 'graphs with operations' is closely related to their 'logico-deductive' side, it figures prominently in the work of [[Jim Lambek]] and [[Phil Scott]] (cf. the references at [[free topos]]).
