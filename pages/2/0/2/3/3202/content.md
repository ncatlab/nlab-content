The term **Lebesgue space** can stand for two distinct notions: one is of the **Lebesgue measure space** (see [[measure space]] and Springer Encyclopaedia of Mathematics: [Lebesgue space](http://eom.springer.de/L/l057910.htm)) and another is of the $L_p$-spaces. 

If $1\leq p \lt \infty$ and a domain $\Omega$ (in a $n$-dimensional real space with easy generalization to manifolds) one first considers the **$L_p$-spaces** $L_p = L_p(\Omega)$ ([wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lp_space)) of (equivalence classes of) [[measurable function|measurable]] (complex or real valued) functions $f:\Omega\to\mathbb{C}$ whose (absolute values of) $p$-th powers are Lebesgue integrable; i.e. whose norm 

$$\| f\|_{L_p} = \left(\int_\Omega |f|^p d\mu\right)^{1/p}$$

is finite. For $p = \infty$ one looks at the essential supremum norm $\|f\|_{L_\infty}$ instead.

The $L_p$-spaces are examples of [[Banach spaces]]; they are continuous analogues of $l_p$-spaces of $p$-summable series.
