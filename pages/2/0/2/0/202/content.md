__$Grp$__ is the [[category]] with [[group|groups]] as [[object|objects]] and group homomorphisms as [[morphism]]s.

More abstractly, we can think of $Grp$ as the [[full subcategory]] of $Cat$ with groups as objects.


##Remarks##

Since groups may be identified with one-object [[groupoid]]s, it is sometimes useful to regard $Grp$ as a $2$-[[2-category|category]], namely as the [[full subcategory|full]] sub-$2$-category of [[Grpd]] on one-object groupoids. In this case the $2$-morphisms between homomorphisms of groups come from "intertwiners": [[inner automorphism]]s of the target group.

On the other hand, if we regard $Grp$ as a full sub-$2$-category of $Grpd_*$, the $2$-category of *[[pointed object|pointed]]* groups, then this is [[locally discrete 2-category|locally discrete]] and [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to the ordinary $1$-[[1-category|category]] $Grp$.  This is because the only *pointed* intertwiner between two homomorphisms is the identity.

Precisely analogous statements hold for the category [[Alg]] of algebras.
