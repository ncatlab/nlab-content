## Idea

In the context of [[étale cohomology]] of [[schemes]], the _Artin comparison theorem_ ([Artin 66](#Artin66)) says that under some conditions on a [[scheme]] and a [[sheaf]] of [[coefficient]],  the [[étale cohomology]] of the scheme coincides with the [[ordinary cohomology]] (e.g. [[singular cohomology]]) of its underlying [[complex analytic topology]].

Historically this kind of statement was a central motivation for the development of [[étale cohomology]] in the first place.

Specifically, let $A$ be either of

* a [[finite group|finite]] [[field]];

* the [[p-adic integers]] $\mathbb{Z}_p$ for some [[prime]] $p \geq 2$;

* the [[p-adic numbers]] $\mathbb{A}_{p}$

(but _not_ for instance the [[integers]] themselves).

Then for $X$ a [[variety]] over the [[complex numbers]] and $X^{an}$ its [[analytification]] to the [[topological space]] of complex points $X(\mathbb{C})$  with its [[complex analytic topology]], then there is an [[isomorphism]]

$$
  H^\bullet(X_{et}, A) \simeq H^\bullet(X^{an}, A)
$$

between the [[étale cohomology]] of $X$ and the [[ordinary cohomology]] of 
$X^{an}$.

Notice that on the other hand for instance if instead $X = Spec(k)$ is the [[spectrum of a commutative ring|spectrum]] of a [[field]], then its [[étale cohomology]] coincides with the [[Galois cohomology]] of $k$. In this way [[étale cohomology]] interpolates between "[[topology|topological]]" and "[[number theory|number theoretic]]" notions of cohomology.
