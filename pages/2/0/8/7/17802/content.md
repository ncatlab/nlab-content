###Idea

A formal system is *complete* or *semantically complete* when all its [[tautologies]] are theorems. 

[[Kurt Gödel]] showed that [[first-order logic]] is complete, that is, any first-order sentence, $\phi$, which is true under any interpretation, is provable from the axioms of first-order logic. This is generally known as **the completeness theorem**.

If in an [[infinitary logic]], infinitely many quantifiers may appear in sentences, then completeness does not hold.
