* [[Jacob Lurie]], 

  _Structured Spaces_ 

  ([arXiv:0905.0459](http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.0459), [pdf](http://www-math.mit.edu/~lurie/papers/DAG-V.pdf))

which develops the generalization of the notion of a [[ringed topos]] from [[topos theory]] to [[(∞,1)-topos theory]] and formulates basic notions of [[geometry]] in this context ("[[higher geometry]]"). 

Precursor in 1-[[category theory]] include

* [[Monique Hakim]], _Topos annel&#233;s et sch&#233;mas relatifs_, Ergebnisse der Mathematik und ihrer Grenzgebiete, Band 64, Springer, Berlin, New York (1972). 

* [[Cole's theory of spectrum]]

The theory is general, but the focus of the examples and applications is on [[derived algebraic geometry]]/[[E-∞ geometry]].

## Survey ##

A survey is at [[A Survey of Elliptic Cohomology - the derived moduli stack of derived elliptic curves]] in the section [notions of space](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/A+Survey+of+Elliptic+Cohomology+-+the+derived+moduli+stack+of+derived+elliptic+curves#notions_of_space_4).
