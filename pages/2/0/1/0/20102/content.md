###### Definition
**(linear extension)**

Given a [[set]] $X$ equipped with a [[partial ordering]] $\leq$, then a _linear extension_ is a [[linear order]] $\leq_{lin}$ on the same set $S$, such that the [[identity function]] $id_S$ is order-preserving

$$
  (S,\leq) \overset{ id_S }{\longrightarrow} \left(S,\leq_{lin}\right)
  \,.

###### Proposition
**(existence of linear extensions)**

For [[finite sets]] linear extensions (Def. \ref{LinearExtensionOfAPartialOrder}) always exist. For non-finite sets this is still the case using the [[axiom of choice]].

A proof under [[axiom of choice|AC]] was first published in ([Marczewski 30](#Marczewski30)). The proposition actually follows from the weaker choice principle called the [[ultrafilter theorem|ultrafilter principle]], by appeal to the [[compactness theorem]], as follows. 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
It is a very simple matter to show linear extensions exist in the [[finite set|finite]] case: one may proceed by [[induction]]. Any finite $n$-element poset has a [[minimal element]] $x$ (meaning $y \leq x$ implies $y = x$). By induction the restricted partial order on $X \setminus \{x\}$ admits a linear extension, and then one may simply prepend $x$ to that linear order to complete the inductive step. 

The rest is a routine application of compactness for [[propositional theories]]. Let $(X, \leq)$ be a partially ordered set, and introduce a [[signature]] consisting of [[signature|constants]] $c_x$, one for each $x \in X$, and a [[binary relation]] $L$. Introduce [[axioms]] $\neg(c_x = c_y)$ whenever $x \neq y$ in $X$, and $L(c_x, c_y)$ whenever $x \leq y$ in the poset $X$, and axioms stating that $L$ is a linear order. By the previous paragraph, the resulting theory is finitely satisfiable upon interpreting each $c_x$ as $x$. Hence the theory is satisfiable. Taking any [[model]] $M$, and interpreting the constants in $M$, and restricting $L$ to them, we obtain a linear extension on $X$.
