This entry is about particulars of the work of Larmore on [[local system|cohomology with local coefficients]] (Steenrod, compare also Reidemeister earlier), a special case of what is now called [[twisted cohomology]].

## Larmore's work ##

The phrase _twisted cohomology_ was  used by Larmore in 

* Larmore, _Twisted cohomology theories and the single obstruction to lifting_,  Pac JM 41 (1972) 755-769

to describe [[cohomology]] $H'(-; E)$ with coefficients in a special kind of [[spectrum]] $E$  related to a [[fibration]] $p : E\to B$. 

The result is what May and Sigurdsson (see references at [[twisted cohomology]]) call a _parameterized spectrum_, the "parameters" being the points of $B$, which might also be called, in the older topological terminology, an _ex-spectrum_.

For any map $f:K\to B$ and, for $L\subset K,$ a partial lift
$h:L\to E$ of $f$, he constructs a _single_ obstruction class $\Gamma(f)\in H'(K, L  ; E)$ to a full lift $g:K\to E.$ 

$$
  \array{
    && &\to& E
    \\
    &{}^h\nearrow& &{}^{g}\nearrow& \downarrow^p
    \\
    L &\hookrightarrow& K &\stackrel{f}{\to}& B
  }
$$


The vanishing of this obstruction is necessary for the existence of a lifting, but it is sufficient only in the usual stable range.

Notice that his cohomology with coefficients in a spectrum does _not_ mean the sequence of [[cohomology group]]s with coefficients in the sequence of spaces constituting the [[spectrum]], but rather a single group. He does explore the relation between his single obstruction and the classical obstructions.
