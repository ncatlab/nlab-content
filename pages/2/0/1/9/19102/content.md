## Idea

The [[standard model of particle physics]] has the curious property that its content of [[fermions]] appears in three sets of particles that share all properties except that their [[rest mass]] increases drastically from one set to the next. These are called the three "generations" "families" of fermionic particles.

[[!include flavors of fundamental particles -- table]]

Any reason for this striking pattern presently remains mysterious.

While the particle content of any one single generation would naturally be explained by [[GUT]] models, in terms of a single [[irreducible representation]] of a [[simple group|simple]] [[gauge group]] containing that of the [[standard model of particle physics]], this does not explain why there are three almost identical copies of this. 

One suggestion to explain this phenomenon appears in [[intersecting D-brane models]]. See there at _[Generations of fermions](intersecting+D-brane+model#GenerationsOfFermions)_.
