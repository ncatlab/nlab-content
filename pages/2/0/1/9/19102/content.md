## Idea

The [[standard model of particle physics]] has the curious property that its content of [[fermions]] appears in three sets of particles that share all properties except that their [[rest mass]] increases drastically from one set to the next. These are called the three "generations" of fermionic particles.

The first generation contains the

| type of [[fundamental particle]] | First [[generation of fundamental particles|generation]] | Second [[generation of fundamental particles|generation]] | Third [[generation of fundamental particles|generation]] |
|------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| up-type [[quark]] | [[up quark]] | [[charm quark]] | [[top quark]] |
| down-type [[quark]] | [[down quark]] | [[strange quark]] | [[bottom quark]] |
| charged [[lepton]] | [[electron]] | [[muon]] | [[tau]] |
| [[neutrino]] | [[electron neutrino]] | [[muon neutrino]] | [[tau neutrino]] |

Any reason for this striking pattern presently remains mysterious.

While the particle content of any one single generation would naturally be explained by [[GUT]] models, in terms of a single [[irreducible representation]] of a [[simple group|simple]] [[gauge group]] containing that of the [[standard model of particle physics]], this does not explain why there are three almost identical copies of this. 

One suggestion to explain this phenomenon appears in [[intersecting D-brane models]]. See there at _[Generations of fermions](intersecting+D-brane+model#GenerationsOfFermions)_.
