## Definition

An $(\infty,1)$-[[(infinity,1)-functor|functor]] $F : C \to D$ is **essentially surjective** if the induced functor of the [[core]] [[infinity-groupoids]] 
$$
  core(F_0) : core(C_0) \to core(D_0)
$$ 
is an [[effective epimorphism]]. 

An $(\infty,1)$-[[(infinity,1)-functor|functor]] $F : C \to D$ is **essentially surjective** if the induced functor of the [[homotopy category of an (infinity,1)-category|homotopy categories]] of the $(\infty,1)$-categories
$$
  h F_0 : h C_0 \to h D_0
$$ 
is [[essentially surjective functor|essentially surjective]]

## Properties

An [[(∞,1)-functor]] which is both essentially surjective as well as [[full and faithful (∞,1)-functor]] is precisely an [[equivalence of (∞,1)-categories]].
