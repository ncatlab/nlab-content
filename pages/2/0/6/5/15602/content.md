## Definition

A __properad__ in a [[symmetric monoidal
category]]&#160;$C$ is a [[monoid]] in the [[monoidal
category]] of [[symmetric sequence|bisymmetric sequences]] in&#160;$C$ (i.e.,
functors $\Sigma\times\Sigma\to C$) equipped
with a version of [[substitution product]]
modeled on connected directed graphs with 2 levels
instead of corollas, which are used for [[operads]].
See &#167;1.2 in [Vallette](#Vallette) for details.
The idea is that operations in a properad can
have multiple inputs and outputs, as opposed
to a single output in an operad.

### Relation to polycategories, dioperads and PROPs

The notion of coloured properads is more general than that of [[polycategories]] in that properads have [[composition]]-operations along more than one object. See at *[polycategory -- Relation to properads](polycategory#RelationToProperads)* for a more detailed explanation.

As with multicategories and operads, and polycategories and dioperads, the distinct term **pluricategory** (see Definition 2.1.11 in [Kavanagh](#Kavanagh)) for the coloured (many-object) version of properad is in use.

Properads are less general than [[PROPs]], which also allow a "composition" of nonconnected graphs, by tensoring morphisms with $\otimes$.
