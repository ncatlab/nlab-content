## Idea
 {#Idea}

*Donaldson theory* is concerned with [[4-manifolds]] using the [[moduli space]] the anti-self-dual [[Yang-Mills equations]] (ASDYM equations), which require a [[principal bundle]] with a [[compact Lie group|compact]] [[gauge group]] $G$ over the [[4-manifold]]. 

This method is named after and was first used by [Donaldson 1983](#Donaldson83) (assuming [[simply connected|simply-connected]] $G$) and [Donaldson 1987](#Donaldson87) (without that restriction) to prove [[Donaldson's theorem]].

Donaldson theory was later surpassed by [[Seiberg-Witten theory]], since [[Donaldson invariants]] often give weaker results than [[Seiberg-Witten invariants]] and the former often requires an additional [[compactification]] of the [[moduli space]]. Nonetheless, there are still unsolved problems in Donaldson theory including the [[Witten conjecture]] and the Atiyah-Floer conjecture.

## Properties

A [[topological field theory|topological]] [[FQFT]]-formulation of Donaldson theory is supposed to be given as a [[functor]] from a suitable [[symplectic category]] of [[symplectic manifolds]] with [[Lagrangian correspondences]] between them which sends a [[symplectic manifold]] to its [[Fukaya category]]. For more on this see at _[[Lagrangian correspondences and category-valued TFT]]_.
