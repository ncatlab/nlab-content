The term 'homomorphism' is very general.  A **homomorphism** between sets equipped with algebraic structure is a map preserving this structure.  This can be made precise using [[Lawvere theories]] or [[monads]].  Generalizing further, we may simply treat 'homomorphism' as a synonym for [[morphism]], although there is a strong tendency to use 'homomorphism' in the case of 'algebraic' categories: for example, nobody seems to speak of a homomorphism between topological spaces, or manifolds.
