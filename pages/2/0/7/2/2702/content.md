#Definition#

A (smooth) _simplicial manifold_ is a [[simplicial object]] in the [[category]] [[Diff]] of (smooth) [[manifold]].

# constructions on simplicial manifolds #

* The [[simplicial deRham complex]] generalizes the [[deRham complex]] from ordinary manifolds to simplicial manifolds.

# Interpretation in terms of higher category theory #

The role of simplicial manifolds in most of the literature is best understood by thinking of $[\Delta^{op}, Diff]$ as a [[subcategory]] $[\Delta^{op}, Diff] \hookrightarrow [\Delta^{op}, PSh(Diff)]$ of that of [[simplicial presheaf|simplicial presheaves]] on [[Diff]]. Using the [[local model structure on simplicial presheaves|local]] [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] which [[presentable (∞,1)-category]] the [[(∞,1)-topos]] of [[∞-stack]]s, one is entitled to think of any simplicial manifold as representing a [[Lie ∞-groupoid]].

In fact, more is true: as discussed there in detail, in the projective local [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] on [[Diff]] there is a cofibrant resolution functor with values in simplicial manifolds. (if we allow [[Diff]] to be closed under coproducts indexed by sets). Therefore every [[∞-stack]] on [[Diff]] may be presented by a simplicial manifold.
