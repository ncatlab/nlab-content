## Definition

A (smooth) _simplicial manifold_ is a [[simplicial object]] in the [[category]] [[Diff]] of [[smooth manifolds]].

Under the canonical inclusion [[Diff]] $\hookrightarrow$ [[Top]] this is in particular a [[simplicial topological space]].

## Constructions on simplicial manifolds 

* The [[simplicial de Rham complex]] generalizes the [[de Rham complex]] from ordinary manifolds to simplicial manifolds.

## Interpretation in terms of higher category theory 

The role of simplicial manifolds in most of the literature is best understood from the [[nPOV]], by thinking of $[\Delta^{op}, Diff]$ as a [[subcategory]] $[\Delta^{op}, Diff] \hookrightarrow [\Delta^{op}, PSh(Diff)]$ of that of [[simplicial presheaf|simplicial presheaves]] on [[Diff]]. Using the [[local model structure on simplicial presheaves|local]] [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] which [[presentable (∞,1)-category|presents]] the [[(∞,1)-topos]] of [[∞-stack]]s, one is entitled to think of any simplicial manifold as representing a [[Lie ∞-groupoid]].

In fact, more is true: as discussed there in detail, in the projective local [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] on [[Diff]] there is a cofibrant resolution functor with values in simplicial manifolds. (Here we allow [[Diff]] to be closed under coproducts indexed by sets; that is, we do not require our manifolds to be connected or second-countable, although we may require their components to be second-countable). Therefore every [[∞-stack]] on [[Diff]] may be presented by a simplicial manifold.
