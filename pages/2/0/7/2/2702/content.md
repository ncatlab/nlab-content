#Definition#

A (smooth) _simplicial manifold_ is a [[simplicial object]] in the [[category]] [[Diff]] of (smooth) [[manifold]].

# constructions on simplicial manifolds #

* The [[simplicial deRham complex]] generalizes the [[deRham complex]] from ordinary manifolds to simplicial manifolds.

# Interpretation in terms of higher category theory #

The role of simplicial manifolds in most of the literature is best understood by thinking of $[\Delta^{op}, Diff]$ as a [[subcategory]] $[\Delta^{op}, Diff] \hookrightarrow [\Delta^{op}, PSh(Diff)]$ of that of [[simplicial presheaf|simplicial presheaves]] on [[Diff]]. Using the [[local model structure on simplicial presheaves|local]] [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] which [[presentable (∞,1)-category]] the [[(∞,1)-topos]] of [[∞-stack]]s, one is entitled to think of any simplicial manifold as representing a [[Lie ∞-groupoid]].
