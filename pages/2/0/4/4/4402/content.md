## Idea


The theory of __cohomological descent__ deals with  the question if the [[derived geometry|derived]] analogue of the (co)monadic [[comparison functor]] is fully faithful (or more rarely an equivalence of categories) when formulated at the level of total derived functors and derived categories, and usually taken with respect to [[hypercovers]].
