A __complete Boolean algebra__ is a [[complete lattice]] that is also a [[Boolean algebra]].  Since lattice homomorphisms of Boolean algebras automatically prefer the Boolean structure, the complete Boolean algebras form a [[full subcategory]] [[CompBoolAlg]] of [[CompLat]].

Assuming [[excluded middle]], complete *[[atom]]ic* Boolean algebras are (up to [[isomorphism]]) precisely [[power sets]].  These abstract representations of power sets are important enough to have their own abbreviation: 'CABA'.

It is interesting to consider whether there is a [[constructive mathematics|constructive]] notion of CABA, classically equivalent to the above, which are precisely power sets even constructively.  (Such CABAs would not typically be Boolean algebras at all.)  These would correspond to [[discrete space|discrete]] [[locales]].  Note that there are many complete atomic [[Heyting algebras]] (equivalently, atomic [[frames]]) that are not power sets (and not Boolean even classically).

Just a quick comment on your question. Let me recall that that there is a notion of $T_1$-frame mimicking that of $T_1$-space. I recall that Bob Par&#233;
had proved that the power set functor (i mean the power object) is a contravariant equivalence between the category of sets (i mean of objects) in a topos and the category of complete atomic $T_1$-frames in the topos.
