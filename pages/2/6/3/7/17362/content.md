##Idea

In [[computer science]] and to some extent also in [[formal logic]], **sugaring** refers to the modification of formal notation ([[syntax]]) into a form which is more readable for humans, thereby "sweetening" it for consumption. Syntactic sugar does not add to the functionality or expressivity of the language.

[[Peter Landin]] first used the expression 'syntactic sugaring' in the context of interpretations of terms in the [[âˆž-calculus]] ([Landin64](#Landin64)).

The reverse process to expressions in the more formal language is sometimes known as 'desugaring'.



## Examples

###### Example

In a [[set theory]] where [[classes]] are not "first-class objects" (for example [[ZFC]], but not [[NBG]]), classes are only syntactic sugar and have no independent existence. For instance, if one defines a class $M \coloneqq \{ X | \varphi(X) \}$ by [[comprehension]], then "$X \in M$" is syntactic sugar for "$\varphi(X)$".

###### Example

In [[formal linguistics]], natural language versions of formal expressions are described as 'sugarings' (Ranta 1994). Often there are many ways to sugar a formal expression into natural language. 

Consider the [[type theory|type theoretic]] expression $\sum_{x: man} \sum_{y: donkey} (x\;owns\; y)$. Ranta (1994, p. 68) gives nine natural language sugarings for it by applying three different operations twice:

* there is a man and there is a donkey and he owns it,
* there is a man and he owns a donkey,
* there is a man and there is a donkey that he owns,
* there is a donkey and a man owns it,
* a man owns a donkey,
* there is a donkey that a man owns,
* there is a man such that there is a donkey and he owns it,
* there is a man who owns a donkey,
* there is a man such that there is a donkey that he owns.
