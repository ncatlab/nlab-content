This page collects material related to the ten volume textbook series

* [[Lev Landau]], [[Evgeny Lifshitz]]:

  **Course of Theoretical Physics**

  $\sim$1950s

  [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Course_of_Theoretical_Physics)

on [[theoretical physics]]

(often referred to simply as "Landau-Lifschitz").


The series was envisioned but not finished in writing by [[Lev Landau|Landau]] himself. It is used extensively by several generation of physicists, well known for clarity of the arguments. It reflects mainly the role of the main author, [[Lev Landau]]; his pupil Lifschitz helped with all volumes, while some other coauthors contributed to some volumes or revisions; volume 4 is written by Beresteckii, Lifschitz and Pitaevskii, without Landau. 

Landau wrote most of volume 1, significant parts of volumes 2,3,5,6,9, and minor part in other volumes. Volume 6 on hydrodynamics reflects his own approach, where he derived most of hydrodynamics from scratch and on the way discovered some of the things classics overlooked. Notice that Lifschitz had a brother, also a theoretical physicist, who actually gave more significant contributions to condensed matter physics.
