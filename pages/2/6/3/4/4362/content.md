which discusses how [[differential cohomology]] -- specifically [[Deligne cohomology]] and [[differential K-theory]] -- is the correct formalism that encodes [[gauge field]]s in physics (such as the [[electromagnetic field]], the [[Kalb-Ramond field]] and the [[RR-field]]) and their [[quantum anomaly|anomalous]] [[action functional]].
