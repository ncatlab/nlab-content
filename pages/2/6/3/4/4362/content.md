This discusses how [[differential cohomology]] -- specifically [[ordinary differential cohomology]] and [[differential K-theory]] -- is the correct formalism for describing [[gauge fields]] and [[higher gauge fields]] in [[physics]] and [[string theory]] (such as [[higher U(1)-gauge fields]] like the [[electromagnetic field]], the [[Kalb-Ramond field]] and the [[supergravity C-field]], and also the [[RR-field]]) and the [[quantum anomaly]]  of  their [[action functionals]].
