## Idea

A _homology sphere_ is a [[topological space]] which need not be [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to an [[n-sphere]], but which has the same [[ordinary homology]] as an $n$-sphere.

## Properties

\begin{corollary}
Every homology sphere is a [[rational homology sphere]].
\end{corollary}

\begin{corollary}
Every [[homotopy sphere]] is a homology sphere.
\end{corollary}

\begin{theorem}
Every [[simply connected]] homology sphere is a [[homotopy sphere]].
\end{theorem}

\begin{proposition}
There are [[simply connected]] homology-$n$-spheres not homeomorphic to the $n$-sphere iff $n\geq 5$.
\end{proposition}
