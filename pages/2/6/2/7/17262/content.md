## Idea

The **quaternion group** (of order 8)  is the multiplicative group $Q_8$ consisting of the four base [[quaternions]] $1, i, j, k$ plus their additive inverses whose defining relations $i^2=j^2=k^2=ijk=-1$ were inscribed by [[William Rowan Hamilton|Sir William Hamilton]] on Brougham Bridge, Dublin on October 16th, 1843 while taking a walk with his wife.

The quaternion group $Q_8$ is the first in a row of _generalized quaternion groups_ $Q_{4n}$, also called **dicyclic groups**.

## Definition

The _dicyclic group_ of order $4n$, $n\geq 2$, is the [[group]] $Q_{4n}$ defined by the presentation $\langle x,y; \quad x^{2n}, x^ny^{-2},y^{-1}xyx\rangle$ where $x\neq y$. The _quaternion group_ (of order 8) is $Q_{4n}$ for $n=2$.
