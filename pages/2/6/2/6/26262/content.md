## Idea

**quiver** ([q.uiver.app](https://q.uiver.app/)) is an open source web-based editor, created by [[varkor]], for [[commutative diagrams]] and [[pasting diagrams]]. It exports to LaTeX via [tikz-cd](https://github.com/astoff/tikz-cd).

The name "quiver" is based on the term *[[quiver]]* used for [[directed graphs]] in [[representation theory]].

For the purpose of editing diagrams here on the nLab, see also at *[[HowTo]]* the section on *[TikZ](HowTo#TikZ)*.
