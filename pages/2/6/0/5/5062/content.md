## Idea

These structures are intended to allow one to talk about 'all such objects 
as may be represented in a picture by arrows', (Venema).


## Arrow frames

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

An **arrow frame** is a [[frame (modal logic)|frame]], $\mathfrak{F} = (W, C, R, I )$, such that $C$ is a ternary relation, (so $C\subseteq 
W \times W \times W$), $R$ is a binary relation, and $I$ a unary one, so $I\subseteq W$. 
=--


## Gloss

The interpretation intended for these relations is similar to the structure of a [[groupoid]], but from a relational point of view.

*  For $C(a,b,c)$ think $a = b\star c$, 'the' _composite_ of $b$ and $c$, but, of course, $a$ need not be uniquely defined by this;

* For $R(a,b)$, think $b$ is a 'reverse' arrow for $a$;

* For $I(a)$ i.e. $a\in I$, think $a$ is an 'identity arrow'.

This defines a frame by a relational signature.  It does not specify any formulae to be satisfied, nor is there a [[geometric models for modal logics|valuation]] around  to give some 'meaning' to the structure.


## Arrow languages

The arrow language follows the general form of the [[modal logic|modal languages]], but note that there are several 'arities' of relation in the structure, so we need several different types of modal operators.

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

The **arrow language** is defined by the rule

$$\phi ::= p \mid \bot \mid \neg \phi \mid \phi_1 \vee \phi_2 \mid \phi\circ \psi \mid \otimes\phi\mid 1',$$  

where the $p$ are the propositional variables, as usual, and in addition

* $1'$ is 'identity' and is a nullary modality or modal constant;

* $\otimes$ (an unfortunate notation, but which seems fairly standard in the sources used for this) is the 'converse' operator and is a 'diamond', i.e. a unary operator, and

*  $\circ$ is the 'composition operator' and is a dyadic operator.
=--

The possible interpretations or readings of these include

$1'$ is SKIP;

$\otimes \phi$ is $phi$  conversely; and 

$\phi\circ \psi$ is 'first $\phi$ then $\psi$'.


## Arrow models

The usual rules for modal semantics apply.  An **arrow model**, $\mathfrak{M}$, consists of an arrow frame, $\mathfrak{F} = (W, C, R, I )$, (and a valuation $V$, which plays a somewhat behind the scenes role in this general situation).  In what follows, $a\in W$, 

*  $\mathfrak{M},a \models 1'$ if and only if $Ia$;

*  $\mathfrak{M},a \models \otimes\phi$ if and only if $\mathfrak{M},b \models\phi$ for some $b$ with $R a b$;

*  $\mathfrak{M},a \models\phi\circ \psi$ if and only if $\mathfrak{M},b \models\phi$ and $\mathfrak{M},c \models\psi$ for some $b,c$ with $C a b c$.
