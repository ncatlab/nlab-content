##Arrow frames, arrow languages and arrow logics##

These structures are intended to allow one to talk about 'all such objects 
as may be represented in a picture by arrows'(Venema).

######Definition######
An **arrow frame** is a [[frame (modal logic)|frames]] $F = (W, C, R, I )$ such that $C$ is a ternary relation, (so $C\subset 
W \times W \times W$, $R$ is a binary relation, and $I$ a unary one, so $I\subset W$.
