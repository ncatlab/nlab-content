## Idea

### Classical spherical functions

Classical spherical functions/harmonics are certain functions on $n$-sphere which are solutions of the Laplace equation restricted to the sphere. 

The most classical case is the case when $n=2$ where spherical functions $Y_{l m}(\theta,\phi)$ (see at [[Legendre polynomial]]) appear in Fourier method of solving Laplace equation in space by in spherical coordinates.

### Spherical functions from representation theory

In representation theory, one considers matrix elements of  certain representations with distinguished covariance properties with respect to a subgroup; this can be interpreted in terms of the homogeneous space. Various generalities are considered with main contributions from [[Israel Gelfand]]'s school and [[Roger Godement]] and later by [[Sigurdur Helgason]].
