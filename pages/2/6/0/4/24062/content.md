## Idea

Where a *[[fundamental particle]]* is the [[quantum]] of a [[field (physics)|field]] which is thought to be part of a "fundamental" [[quantum field theory]], a *quasi-particle* is the [[quantum]] of a [[field (physics)|field]] as it appears in some *[[effective quantum field theory|effective]]* quantum field thoery: A quasi-particle may behave much as a fundamental particle, but on closer resolution it appears as a collective excitement of more fundamental particles.

For an archetypical example in [[condensed matter theory]]: [[phonons]] in a [[crystal]] are quasi-particle excitations, underlying which are collective [[wave]]-oscillations of the more fundamental [[electrons]] and [[nuclei]] that constitute the underlying [[crystal lattice]].
