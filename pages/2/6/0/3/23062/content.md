## Idea

For $G$ a [[topological group]], there exists a [[model category]]-[[mathematical structure|structure]] on the [[category]] of [[topological G-spaces]] whose [[weak equivalences]] and [[fibrations]] are those morphisms whose [[underlying]] [[continuous functions]] between $H$-[[fixed loci]], for all [[closed subgroups]] $H \subset_{clsd} G$, are weak equivalences or fibrations, respectively, in the [[classical model structure on topological spaces]], hence [[weak homotopy equivalences]] or [[Serre fibrations]], respectively.

In the case that $G$ is a [[compact Lie group]], the corresponding [[homotopy theory]] coincides with that of [[G-CW complexes]] [[localization|localized]] at $G$-equivariant [[homotopy equivalences]].

For general $G$, [[Elmendorf's theorem]] asserts that this is [[Quillen equivalence|Quillen equivalent]] to the [[model category of simplicial presheaves]] on the [[orbit category]] of $G$ (...).
