## Idea

A Lie 2-algebra is to a [[Lie 2-group]] as a [[Lie algebra]] is to a [[Lie group]].  Thus, it is a [[vertical categorification]] of a [[Lie algebra]].


## Definition

A Lie 2-algebra is an $L_\infty$-[[L-âˆž-algebra|algebra]] with generators concentrated in degree 1 and 2.

If the trinary bracket in a Lie 2-algebra is trivial, one speaks of a [[strict Lie 2-algebra]].


## Examples

* [[derivation Lie 2-algebra]]

* [[string Lie 2-algebra]]
