## Idea

A Lie 2-algebra is to a [[Lie 2-group]] as a [[Lie algebra]] is to a [[Lie group]].

## Definition

A Lie 2-algebra is an [[L-∞-algebra]] with generators concentrated in degree 1 and 2.

If the trinary bracket in a Lie 2-algebra is trivial, one speaks of a [[strict Lie 2-algebra]].

## Examples

* [[derivation Lie 2-algebra]]

* [[string Lie 2-algebra]]
