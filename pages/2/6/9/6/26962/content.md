## Idea

*Convex mixtures* are to  [[convex combinations]] as [[integrals]] are to [[sums]]. 

In other words, convex mixtures are given by [[integration|integrating]] a [[function]] with respect to a [[measure]] whose total normalization is one (hence, a [[probability measure]]).

The concept is used in [[analysis]] and [[geometry]] as a generalization of midpoints,
as well as in [[probability theory]] to take [[expectation values]] of [[random variables]].

In terms of [[category theory]], it is tightly related to the [[Giry monad]] and other [[probability monads]]. 
 

## Constructions

### For real numbers

Let $X$ be a [[measurable space]]. 
We can view a function $f \colon X\to\mathbb{R}$ as an [[indexed set|indexed collection]] of [[real numbers]]. 
If $X$ is [[finite set|finite]], one can take the *average*, or *midpoint*:
$$
\frac{f(x_1)+\dots+f(x_n)}{n}
$$
More generally, given a [[probability distribution]] $p$ on $X$, one can take the *weighted average*, or convex combination,
$$
\sum_{x\in X} f(x)\,p(x) .
$$
The resulting number is a convex combination of the numbers $f(x)$.

Convex mixtures generalize this to the infinite case: if the function $f$ is [[measurable function|measurable]], given a [[probability measure]] $p$ on $X$, one can take, if it exists, the [[integral]]
$$
\int_X f(x) \,p(d x) \,.
$$
One can view the resulting value as a mixture, analogous to a convex combination, of the points $f(x)$. (More precisely, of the points in the support of the [[pushforward measure]] $f_*p$ on $\mathbb{R}$.)

In the language of [[probability theory]], we are taking the [[expectation value]] of the [[random variable]] $f$ on the [[probability space]] $(X,p)$.

A very similar construction can be given by replacing $\mathbb{R}$ with a generic Banach space, using [[Bochner integrals]]. 


### For probability measures

Given measurable spaces $X$ and $Y$, we can consider the space of probability measures $P Y$ on $Y$, and equip it with its canonical [[sigma-algebra]] (see [[Giry monad]]). 
This way, a measurable function $f:X\to P Y$ is equivalently a [[Markov kernel]] $k_f:X\to Y$. 
Given a probability measure $p$ on $X$, the resulting convex mixture is, equivalently, the composition of the Markov kernel with the measure $p$ (seen as a kernel from the one-point space): for every measurable subset $B$ of $Y$,
$$
\int_X f(x)(B)\,p(d x) \;=\; \int_X k_f(B|x)\,p(d x) .
$$
In other words, mixtures of measures are equivalently compositions in the [[Stoch|category of Markov kernels]].

In particular, taking $f$ to be the identity (i.e. nonparametrically), a mixture of probability measures on $Y$ is given by integrating a *probability measure over probability measures* over $Y$, $\pi\in P P Y$:
$$
B \;\mapsto\; \int_{PY} q(B) \, \pi(d q) .
$$
This is equivalently the multiplication of the [[Giry monad]] and of most [[probability monads]] (more below).


### In terms of monad algebras

The [[Giry monad]] is the most general [[monad of probability measures]] on the category of measurable spaces. 
[[algebra over a monad|Algebras]] of the Giry monad, therefore, can be interpreted exactly as spaces where one can form arbitrary convex mixtures. This is analogous to how [[convex spaces]], where one can form arbitrary convex combinations, are the algebras of the [[distribution monad]].

In particular, mixtures of probability measures can be seen as instances of the multiplication of the Giry monad, or more generally, as compositions of [[Markov kernels]]. Indeed, Markov kernels are the [[Kleisli morphisms]] of the Giry monad, and hence their composition is defined in terms of the monad multiplication.

Similar notions of mixture can be given using other [[probability monads]]. Note that, in order to have a *convex* mixture, one needs a form of normalization.


## Examples

* In [[probability theory]], the expected value of an integrable [[random variable]] is a convex mixture.
* In [[physics]], convex mixtures give the [[center of mass]] of non-discrete bodies.
* The multiplication of the [[Giry monad]], and of most [[probability monads]], consists of taking a convex mixture of probability measure.
* The [[ergodic decomposition theorem]] says that in some cases, every [[invariant measure]] is a convex mixture of [[ergodic measure|ergodic ones]].
