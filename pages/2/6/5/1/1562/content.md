An __$(n,1)$-category__, is an $n$-[[n-category|category]] $C$ that is __locally $(n-1)$-groupoidal__; that is, for any [[object]]s $x$ and $y$, the $(n-1)$-category $C(x,y)$ is an $(n-1)$-[[n-groupoid|groupoid]].

Special cases:
*  A $(1,1)$-category is the same as a $1$-[[1-category|category]], which is an ordinary [[category]].
*  A $(2,1)$-category is a [[locally groupoidal 2-category|locally groupoidal]] $2$-[[2-category|category]].
*  An $(\infty,1)$-[[(infinity,1)-category|category]] can be understood as a [[quasi-category]] or in many other ways.
