## Idea

There are a number of approaches to apply [[category theory]] to [[probability]] and related fields, such as [[statistics]], [[information theory]] and [[dynamical systems]].

On one hand, one can study the existing structures in traditional probability theory (such as [[probability spaces]], [[integration]], and so on) using a categorical lens. For instance, the [[Giry monad]] models the formation of spaces of [[probability measures]] and its iterations, used for example in the context of [[de Finetti's theorem]].

On the other hand, one can try to express certain aspects of [[probability]] and [[statistics]] [[analytic versus synthetic|synthetically]]. One looks for [[structures]] and [[axioms]] which can be thought of as "fundamental" in probability and statistics, and which one can use to prove theorems, without having to use [[measure theory]] directly. One then proves that the usual measure-theoretic treatment is a [[model]] (or [[semantics]]) of this theory. This approach is often called **synthetic probability theory**, in analogy for example with [[synthetic differential geometry]].

One of the most recent approaches to synthetic probability theory is given by [[Markov categories]].
