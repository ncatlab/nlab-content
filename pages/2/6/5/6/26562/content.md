## Idea

There are a number of approaches to apply [[category theory]] to [[probability]] and related fields, such as [[statistics]], [[information theory]] and [[dynamical systems]].

On one hand, one can study the existing structures in traditional probability theory (such as [[probability spaces]], [[integration]], and so on) using a categorical lens. For instance, the [[Giry monad]] models the formation of spaces of [[probability measures]] and its iterations, used for example in the context of [[de Finetti's theorem]].

On the other hand, one can try to express certain aspects of [[probability]] and [[statistics]] [[analytic versus synthetic|synthetically]]. One looks for [[structures]] and [[axioms]] which can be thought of as "fundamental" in probability and statistics, and which one can use to prove theorems, without having to use [[measure theory]] directly. One then proves that the usual measure-theoretic treatment is a [[model]] (or [[semantics]]) of this theory. This approach is often called **synthetic probability theory**, in analogy for example with [[synthetic differential geometry]].
One of the most recent approaches to synthetic probability theory is given by [[Markov categories]].

The main end goals of categorical probability are

* To generalize existing results in probability theory to more general settings, for example with less stringent conditions on countability, separability, etc.;
* To find new results, which with the traditional methods would have been too complex to prove;
* To make probability and related fields more accessible to practitioners, thanks to the fact that the formalism incorporates measure theory without requiring any deep knowledge of it.


## Main structures of interest

[[category theory|Category theory]] was first developed to model particular structures in [[algebraic topology]], and subsequently [[algebraic geometry]], [[algebra]], [[logic]] and [[computer science]]. Each one of these intended applications shaped a piece of the theory, adding to category theory the relevant structures of interest for each application.

The applications of category theory to probability are among the most recent, and are both bringing new categorical structures into the theory (such as [[Markov categories]]), as well as repurposing and reinterpreting existing ideas (such as [[monads]]).

### Markov categories

[[Markov categories]] are a recent framework that models categories whose morphisms can be thought of as having randomness, such as [[stochastic maps]] and [[Markov kernels]]. 
It has a graphical formalism which keeps track of the stochastic dependencies, and which can be used to prove theorems in probability purely graphically.

For more details, see [[Markov category]].


### Probability monads

[[probability monads|Probability monads]] can be thought of as a way of adding a notion of "randomness" to an existing theory.
A [[monad]] often models the idea of "forming spaces of particular structures", and in probability theory, one is interested in forming spaces of [[probability measures]].
Monads are particularly useful when this construction needs to be iterated, for example, when in [[de Finetti theorem|de Finetti]] situations one needs to form _probability measures over probability measures_. 

For more details, see [[probability monad]].


### Dagger categories

[[dagger categories|Dagger categories]] can be thought of as "undirected" categories, where morphisms can be seen as going either way as in an undirected graph. 
In [[probability theory]], joint distributions, or [[transport plans]] exhibit such a behavior, sometimes called [[Bayesian inversion]].
Several probabilistic ideas can be modelled in terms of dagger-categorical concepts, for example, [[conditional expectation]].

For more details, see [[category of couplings]].


## Main results

Using category-theoretic methods, several results have been obtained in the past few years.

Firstly, some known concepts and results of probability theory have been given a category-theoretic description.
(For example: expressing [[Kolmogorov's extension theorem]] as a [[cofiltered limit]] condition.) This allows to incorporate the existing theory of probability into the categorical framework, and is the basic starting point for further results. 
(For example, every time in traditional probability Kolmogorov's extension theorem is invoked, one now knows that a certain universal property is being used.)

Secondly, some classical results of probability theory have been restated and reproven using category theory.
Often this adds new insight into the problem, and allows, for example, to drop further unnecessary assumptions (see the next point).
In addition, the category-theoretic formalism often trades higher complexity for higher abstraction. This way, while more abstract, the categorical proofs tend to be simpler than their measure-theoretic counterparts. (And so, they also allow to prove more difficult results more easily.) 

Thirdly, and most importantly, *new theorems* have been proven, as well as generalizations and extensions of old theorems, especially from the discrete to the continuous case. 

Here is a partial list, roughly in alphabetical order, roughly divided by subject.

(Work in progress, especially adding the relevant references.)
