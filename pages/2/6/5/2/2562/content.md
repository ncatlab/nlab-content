There are multiple notions of domain of mathematics. These include:

* in [[ring theory]]: 

  [[domain (ring theory)]] and [[integral domain]]

* in [[domain theory]]: 

  [[Scott domains]]: [[pointed directed-complete partial orders]]

* in [[category theory]]: 

  [[source]] of a [[morphism]]

* [[domain of discourse]]

* The [[subset]] $A\subseteq X$ for which there exists a [[relation]] $R\colon X \to Y$.

* in [[differential geometry]] and especially in [[complex analysis]]:

  an [[open subset]] of a [[manifold]] (cf. *[[Stein domain]]*)
