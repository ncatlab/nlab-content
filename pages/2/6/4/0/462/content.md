**Geometric function theory** is an approach to [representation theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_theory) using structures appearing in the context of [[groupoidification]]. It studies the operation on derived categories of [[sheaf|sheaves]] (i.e. on the [[homotopy category|homotopy categories]] of [[complex|complexes]] of [[sheaf|sheaves]]) through [[span|spans]] of [[groupoid|groupoids]]. 

#Remarks#

* Toy examples of the general pattern are [[group]] algebra regarded as [[category algebra|category algebras]] (see the end of that entry for the span-description of category algebras). 

* As remarked at [[groupoidification]], this is closely related to and motivated by [[quantum field theory]]. 

  * The higher sheaves on spans appearing in [[groupoidification]] and geometric function theory are sometimes known as [[bi-brane|bi-branes]].
