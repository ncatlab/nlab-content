## Idea


A _profinite set_ is a [[pro-object]] in [[FinSet]]. By [[Stone duality]] these are [[equivalence|equivalent]] to [[Stone spaces]] and thus are often called _profinite spaces_. So these are [[compact space|compact]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[connected space|totally disconnected]] [[topological spaces]].

These are precisely the spaces which are small [[cofiltered limits]] of finite [[discrete spaces]], and moreover (as a consequence of [[Stone duality]]) the [[category]] of Stone spaces is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to the category $pro(FinSet)$ of [[pro-objects]] in [[FinSet]] and finite sets sit $FinSet\hookrightarrow pro(FinSet)$ as finite discrete spaces.  This is especially common when talking about [[profinite groups]] and related topics.

###### Example

An [[internal group]] in the category of Stone spaces /  profinite spaces and continuous maps is a [[profinite group]].

###### Remark

Just as the term '[[space]]' is used by some schools of [[algebraic topology|algebraic topologists]] as a synonym for [[simplicial set]], so 'profinite space' is sometimes used as meaning a '[[simplicial object]] in the category of compact and totally disconnected topological spaces', i.e. in the other terminology a 'simplicial profinite space'. This is further complicated by the question of whether or not pro(finite simplicial sets)
and simplicial profinite spaces are the same thing.
