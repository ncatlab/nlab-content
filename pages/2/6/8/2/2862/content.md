[[Bourbaki]] complained that in Arabic 'al' is an article so classical 'bi-' for two is incompatible with it. Thus Bourbaki and much of the French school makes it a point to say 'cogebra, bigebra' instead of 'coalgebra, bialgebra'. 

In modern [[algebra]], dealing with co-operations $A\to A^{\otimes n}$ instead of only with operations $A^{\otimes n}\to A$ for some monoidal product $\otimes$, is a specialty of a group of people who are often centered around the study of [[Hopf algebras]], but the subject is much wider including internal co(al)gebras, cogroups in cartesian categories, Tannaka reconstruction, PROPs (which have even operations taking $m$ arguments to $k$ arguments, hence generalizing both operations and co-operations), co-operads, bi(al)gebroids, Hopf algebroids, entwining structures, mixed distributive laws and so on. Common tools are graphical calculations (extending also to planar algebras and alike), Sweedler notation and so on.

We may call this area the theory of __gebras__ as in the article
