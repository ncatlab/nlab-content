## Idea

The **circle** is a fantastic thing with lots and lots of [[stuff, structure, property|properties and extra structures]].  It is a:

* [[topological space]]
* [[smooth manifold]]
* [[Lie group]] (the [[circle group]])
* [[co-H-group]]

and it is one of the basic building blocks for lots of areas of mathematics, including:

* [[homotopy theory]]
* [[loop spaces]]
* [[knots]] and [[links]]


## Definition

We consider the circle first as a [[topological space]], then as the [[homotopy type]] represented by that space.

### As a topological space

+-- {: .num_defn #circle}
###### Definition
The two most common definitions of the circle are:

1. It is the subspace of $\mathbb{C}$ consisting of those numbers of length $1$:

   $$
   U(1) \coloneqq \{z \in \mathbb{C} : {|z|} = 1\}
   $$

   (of course, $\mathbb{C}$ can be identified with $\mathbb{R}^2$ and an equivalent formulation of this definition given; also, to emphasise the reason for the notation $U(1)$, $\mathbb{C}$ can be replaced by $\mathbb{C}^* = GL_1(\mathbb{C})$)

2. It is the quotient of $\mathbb{R}$ by the integers:

   $$
   S^1 \coloneqq \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}
   $$
=--

The standard equivalence of the two definitions is given by the map $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{C}$, $t \mapsto e^{2 \pi i t}$.

### As a homotopy type

As a [[homotopy type]] the circle is for instance the [[homotopy pushout]]

$$
  S^1 \simeq * \coprod_{* \coprod * } * 
  \,.
$$

In [[homotopy type theory]], this can be formalized as a [[higher inductive type]] generated by a point `base` and a path from `base` to itself; see the references.

## Properties

The topological circle is a [[compact space|compact]], [[connected space|connected]] [[topological space]].  It is a $1$-[[dimension|dimensional]] [[smooth manifold]] (indeed, it is the only $1$-dimensional compact, connected smooth manifold).  It is **not** [[simply connected space|simply connected]]. 

The circle is a model for the [[classifying space]] for the [[abelian group]] $\mathbb{Z}$, the [[integer]]s. Equivalently, the circle is the [[Eilenberg-Mac Lane space]] $K({\mathbb{Z}},1)$. Equivalently, the loop space of the circle is the free group on one generator. A proof of this in [[homotopy type theory]] is in [Shulman P1S1](#ShulmanP1S1).

We present a proof below. Let $\infty Grpd_*$ denote the [[(∞,1)-category]] of pointed [[infinity-groupoids]].
+-- {: .num_lemma #leftAdjoint}
###### Lemma
The $(\infty,1)$-functor $-_1:Grp(\infty Grpd)\to \infty Grpd_*$ which sends a group object internal to $\infty Grpd$ to its object in degree 1 has left adjoint $J:\infty Grpd_* \to Grp(\infty Grpd)$ characterized by the formula ${\mathbf{B}}J(X) \simeq \Sigma X$.
=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
Recall that, for $G$ a group object internal to $\infty Grpd$, there is a natural homotopy equivalence $G_1\simeq \Omega {\mathbf{B}}G$. For $X$ a a pointed space, let $i_X: X\to \Omega \Sigma X$ denote the [[adjunct]] to the identity map $id_{\Sigma X}:\Sigma X\to\Sigma X$ under the suspending-looping adjunction. 

We have to check the universal property
$$
  \array{
    && X 
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{i_c}}\swarrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    \Omega\Sigma X &&\underset{\Omega {\mathbf{B}}\tilde f}{\to}&& \Omega {\mathbf{B}} G
    \\
    \\
    J(X) &&\underset{\tilde f}{\to}&& G
  }
$$
Indeed, the unique $(\infty,1)$-group homomorphism $\tilde{f}$ which fits into the above diagram is characterized by the property that ${\mathbf{B}}\tilde{f}:\Sigma X \to {\mathbf{B}} G$ is adjunct to $f: X\to \Omega {\mathbf{B}} G$.
 =--

+-- {: .num_theorem #loopingTheCirle}
###### Theorem
The loop space $\Omega S^1$ of the circle is 1-truncated with $\pi_0(\Omega S^1)$ the free group ${\mathbb{Z}}$ of [[integer]]s.
=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
Since $S^1$ is homotopy equivalent to the suspension $\Sigma S^0$ of the two-point space, for $J$ denote the left adjoint described in the previous lemma, it suffices to show that the group object $H$ internal to $\infty Grpd$ such that $H_1$ is the discrete group ${\mathbb{Z}}$ of [[integer]]s has the universal property of $J(S^0)$.  

Indeed, regard $S^0$ as a based subspace of ${\mathbb{Z}}$ by sending the nonbasepoint of $S^0$ to a generator of ${\mathbb{Z}}$. Then, for $G$ a group object, let a based map $f:S^0\to \Omega {\mathbf{B}} G$ be given
$$
  \array{
    && S^0 
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{inc}}\swarrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    {\mathbb{Z}} &&\underset{\Omega {\mathbf{B}}\tilde f}{\to}&& \Omega {\mathbf{B}} G
    \\
    \\
    H &&\underset{\tilde f}{\to}&& G
  }
$$
The unique $(\infty,1)$-group homomorphism $\tilde{f}$ which fits into the above diagram is characterized by the property that ${\mathbf{B}}\tilde{f}:H \to {\mathbf{B}} G$ is adjunct to $(t^n\mapsto \ast_n f(t)): {\mathbb{Z}}\to \Omega {\mathbf{B}} G$. Here, we denote the generator of ${\mathbb{Z}}$ by $t$ and $\ast_n f(t)$ denotes the (equivalence class of) n-fold self-concatenation of a loop whose equivalence class is $f(t)$.

Hence, by abstract nonsense, $J(S^0)$ and $H$ are equivalent as groups. Therefore $\Omega {\mathbf{B}} J(S^0)\simeq \Omega {\mathbf{B}} H \simeq H_1 := {\mathbf{Z}}$, which is the assertion.   
 =--

This theorems encodes all (except the zeroth) [[homotopy group]]s of the circle. Explicitly, the first [[homotopy group]] $\pi_1(S^1)$ is the [[integer]]s $\mathbb{Z}$. But the higher [[homotopy groups]] $\pi_n(S^1) \simeq *$, $n \gt 1$ all vanish (and so is a [[homotopy type|homotopy 1-type]]). 

The [[product]] of the circle with itself is the ($2$)-[[torus]]

$$
  T = S^1 \times S^1
  \,.
$$

Generally, the $n$-torus $T^n$ is $(S^1)^n$.
