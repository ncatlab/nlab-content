A **loset** is a [[set]] equipped with a [[linear order]], that is an [[asymmetric relation|asymmetric]], [[linear relation|linear]] [[comparison]] $\lt$.

# Examples #

Classically, any [[total order]] defines an example of a linear order, as explained at [[linear order]], and this also holds constructively in discrete mathematics.  So here I will focus on constructive analysis.

Of course, the big example here is the field of [[real number]]s.  Both the Dedekind reals and the Cauchy reals (even if [[countable choice]] fails so these are not equivalent) have a linear order $\lt$ that extends the (discrete) linear order on the rational numbers.  Since the corresponding partial order $\leq$ cannot be proved total (and in some classically invalid versions of constructive mathematics can even be proved not total), $\lt$ is more directly useful than $\leq$ is constructive analysis.  In any case, $\lt$ is more fundamental, since $\leq$ can be defined in terms of $\lt$ but not the other way around.

The Mac Neille real numbers have both $\lt$ and $\leq$; however, in this case, neither is a linear or total order, nor can they be defined in terms of one another.

Baire space and Cantor space, being representable as subspaces of the real line, of course are linearly ordered.  It\'s also interesting to see them as coming from the (discrete) linear orders on $\mathbf{N}$ and $\mathbf{2}$, which they are $\mathbf{N}$-fold products of.
