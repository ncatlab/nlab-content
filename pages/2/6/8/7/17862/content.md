## Idea

An arrangement of the chemical elements, originally due to Russian scientist, Dmitri Mendeleev, in the nineteenth century, which displays the common behaviors of families of elements according to the pattern of occupation of the outer electron shell.

An explanation of the order of the elements in terms of [[quantum chemistry]] is given by [[Richard Feynman]] ([Feyn63](#Feynman63)).
