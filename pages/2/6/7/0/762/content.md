##Filtered space##

A [[filtered space]] $X_*$ consists of a space $X=X_\infty$ and a sequence of subspaces 

$$X_*:= \quad X_0 \subseteq X_1 \subseteq \cdots \subseteq X_n \subseteq \cdots \subseteq X_\infty. $$

Standard examples are : 

1. A CW-complex $X$ with its filtration by skeleta $X^n$.

1. The free topological monoid $FX$ on a space $X$ filtered by the length of words. 

1. A similar example to the last using free groups instead of free monoids. 

1. A similar example to the last using free groupoids on topological graphs. 

1. A similar example to the last using the universal topological groupoid $U_\sigma(G)$ induced from a topological groupoid $G$ by a continuous function $f: Ob(G) \to Y$ to a space $Y$. 

Thus filtered spaces arise from many geometric and algebraic situations. (See also [[stratified space]]s). 
So it is  interesting that one can define strict higher homotopy groupoids for filtered spaces more easily than for spaces themselves. 

Note also that it is standard to be able to replace, using mapping cylinders, a sequence of maps $Y_n \to Y_{n+1}$ by a sequence of inclusions.
