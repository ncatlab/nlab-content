## Selected writings

On the [[interpretation of quantum mechanics]] (see at _[[Bohr topos]]_):

* {#Bohr49} [[Nils Bohr]],  _Discussion with Einstein on Epistemological Problems in Atomic Physics_ in P. A. Schilpp (ed.) _Albert Einstein, Philosopher-Scientist_ (Evanston: Library of Living Philosophers) pp. 201&#8211;241. (1949)

> _however far the phenomena transcend the scope of classical physical explanation, the account of all evidence must be expressed in classical terms_ . The argument is simply that by the word 'experiment' we refer to a situation where we can tell others what we have done and what we have learned and that, therefore, the account of the experimental arrangement and the results of the observations must be expressed in unambiguous language with suitable application of the terminology of classical physics.
