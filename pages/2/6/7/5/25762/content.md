## Idea

A *double monoid* &lbrack;[Aguiar & Mahajan (2010)](#AguiarMahajan10) or *duoid* *[Batanin & Markl (2012)](#BataninMarkl12)* is an object of a [[duoidal category]] equipped with two compatible [[monoid]] [[structures]].

## Definitions

### With a binary operation and an element

Naively, a **duoid** is a [[set]] $D$ equipped with a [[pair]] of [[monoid]] [[structures]] $(\otimes, I)$ and $(\odot, J)$ such that:

\[
  (v \otimes x) \odot (y \otimes z) 
  \;=\; 
  (v \odot y) \otimes (x \odot z)
  \,.
\]


In this form, a duoid can be viewed as a [[strict double category]] with a single [[object]], one [[horizontal morphism]], and one [[vertical morphism]].

However, due to the [[Eckmannâ€“Hilton argument]], this is equivalent to a [[commutative monoid]]. In fact, this is true for a duoid in any [[braided monoidal category]] (viewed as a [[duoidal category]] in which both tensor products coincide).

### In a duoidal category
