## Definitions

### With a binary operation and an element

A **duoid** is a set $D$ equipped with two monoid structures $(\otimes, I)$ and $(\odot, J)$ such that:

\[(v \otimes x) \odot (y \otimes z) = (v \odot y) \otimes (x \odot z)\]

### In a duoidal category

See [[duoidal category]].

### As a trivial double category

A duoid is precisely a [[strict double category]] with one object, one horizontal morphism, and one vertical morphism.

## References

Duoids were introduced as "double monoids" in the context of [[duoidal categories]] in Definition 6.28:

They were given the name we use in:
