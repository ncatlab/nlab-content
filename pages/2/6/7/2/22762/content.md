## Idea

A [[symmetric midpoint algebra]] that is also a [[0-truncated]] [[symmetric 2-group]]. 

## Definition

A __symmetric midpoint group__ or __abelian midpoint group__ is a set $G$ with an element $0:G$, a function $-: G \to G$, a binary operation $(-)+(-):G \times G \to G$ and a binary operation $(-)\vert(-): G \times G \to G$ such that

* $(G,+,0,-)$ is an [[abelian group]]

* $(G,\vert,0,-)$ is a [[symmetric midpoint algebra]]

* for all $a$ and $b$ in $G$, $a \vert b + a \vert b = a + b$

## Examples

The [[rational numbers]], [[real numbers]], and the [[complex numbers]] with $a \vert b \coloneqq \frac{a + b}{2}$ are examples of symmetric midpoint groups. 

The [[dyadic rational numbers]] are the [[free object|free]] symmetric midpoint group on one [[generator]]. 

The [[trivial group]] is a symmetric midpoint group, and is in fact a [[zero object]] in the [[category]] of symmetric midpoint groups.
