
## Disambiguation 

The term "Ass" is used in [[mathematics]] for:

* The [[associative operad]] $\mathrm{As}$ or $\mathrm{Assoc}$

* The category $\mathrm{Asm}$ of [[assemblies]]

**Note:** *Due to confusion with the English language obscenity, the nLab now discourages the usage of the term "Ass" on the nLab itself to refer to either one of the objects above, instead preferring the alternate terms listed. If you encounter uses of this sort elsewhere on the nLab, please replace them if possible.*
