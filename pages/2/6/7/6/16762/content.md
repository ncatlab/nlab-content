## Idea

...resolution of [[singularities]]...

## Examples

* the [[Fulton-MacPherson compactification]] of [[configuration spaces of points]] may be regarded as resolution of the [[fat diagonal]] inside an iterated [[Cartesian product]]

* [[Bridgeland stability]] over resolution of [[ADE-singularities]]: see [there](Bridgeland+stability+condition#OverResolutionsOfADESingularities)

## Related concept

* [[ADE singularity]]

  * [[M-theory lift of gauge enhancement on D6-branes]]

  * [[triple membrane junction]]
