## Idea

...resolution of [[singularities]]...

## Examples

* the [[Fulton-MacPherson compactification]] of [[configuration spaces of points]] may be regarded as resolution of the [[fat diagonal]] inside an iterated [[Cartesian product]]

* [[Bridgeland stability]] over resolution of [[ADE-singularities]]: see [there](Bridgeland+stability+condition#OverResolutionsOfADESingularities)

## Related concept

* [[ADE singularity]]

  * [[M-theory lift of gauge enhancement on D6-branes]]

  * [[triple membrane junction]]

The theorem of [Hironaka 64](#Hironaka64) was used to discuss singular [[distributions]] (in the sense of [[generalized functions]]) in

This method is closely related to the resolution of singularities of [[propagators]]/[[Feynman amplitudes]] by passage to [[Fulton-MacPherson compactification|compactified]] [[configuration spaces of points]], as disucussed at _[[Feynman amplitudes on compactified configuration spaces of points]]_.
