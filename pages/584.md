#Idea#

$n$-Dimensional [[manifold]]s (possibly and usually equipped with certain structure, notably for instance with orientation) should naturally form an [[(infinity,n)-category]] of [[extended cobordism]]s whose

* [[object]]s are 0-dimensional (oriented) manifolds (disjoint unions of (oriented) points);

* 1-[[morphism]]s are (oriented) [[cobordism]]s between disjoint unions of (oriented) points;

* 2-morphisms are cobordisms between 1-dimensional cobordisms

* etc.

* (n+1)-morphims are _diffeomorphisms_ between $n$-dimensional cobordisms;

* (n+2)-morphisms are smooth homotopies of these;

* etc.

The $(\infinity,n)$-category of cobordisms is the subject of the [[cobordism hypothesis]].




#References#

A specific realization of this idea in terms of [[(infinity,n)-category]] modeled as [[n-fold complete Segal space]] is in (definition 2.2.9, page 36)

*  [[Jacob Lurie]], [[On the Classification of Topological Field Theories]].

In that article a proof of the [[cobordism hypothesis]] is indicated.

A detailed construction of the [[(n,r)-category|(2,2)-category]] of cobordisms is
