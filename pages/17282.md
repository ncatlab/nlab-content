## Idea
**Construction in philosophy** is the name of an article by F. W. J. Schelling in   '_Kritisches Journal der Philosophie_' (1802) that was the preliminary culmination point of a development in philosophy going back to Descartes and Spinoza and forcefully updated by I. Kant in '_Metaphysische Anfangsgründe der Naturwissenschaft_' (1786) , namely the attempt to philosophize '_more geometrico_'.

In the 20th century this tradition has been revitalized partly by the school of phenomenology and in the context of analytical philosophy by M. Dummett.

## Peirce on construction in mathematics and philosophy

>Kant is entirely right in saying that, in drawing those consequences, the mathematician uses what, in geometry, is called a ‘construction’, or in general a diagram, or visual array of characters or lines. Such a construction is formed according to a precept furnished by the hypothesis. Being formed, the construction is submitted to the scrutiny of observation, and new relations are discovered among its parts, not stated in the precept by which it was formed, and are found, by a little mental experimentation, to be such that they will always be present in such a construction. Thus the necessary reasoning of mathematics is performed by means of observation and experiment, and its necessary character is due simply to the circumstance that the subject of this observation and experiment is a diagram of our own creation, the condition of whose being we know all about.

>But Kant, owing to the slight development which formal logic had received in his time, and especially owing to his total ignorance of the logic of relatives, which throws a brilliant light upon the whole of logic, fell into error in supposing that mathematical and philosophical necessary reasoning are distinguished by the circumstance that the former uses constructions. This is not true. All necessary reasoning whatsoever proceeds by constructions; and the difference between mathematical and philosophical necessary deductions is that the latter are so excessively simple that the construction attracts no attention and is overlooked.
