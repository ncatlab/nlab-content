Let $X$ be an [[algebraic variety]] (in the modern approach an irreducible reduced [[scheme]] of finite type over a [[field]], but we will work here with the usual [[maximal spectrum|maximal spectra]] to simplify the exposition). To a variety one can associate a [[function field]] $k(X)$ whose elements are [[rational function]]s on $X$ (they are regular functions on the big-Zariski open subvarieties of $X$). A [[partial function|partially defined map]] from a variety to another variety is [[rational map|rational]] if it is defined and regular on a Zariski open set. One can check easily that in fact rational maps compose. Rational maps which have an inverse on a Zariski open subset are called [[birational maps]] or birational isomorphisms (see there for a more precise definition).

**Birational geometry** considers properties of varieties which depend only on the birational class, i.e., they are equivalent when they have isomorphic function fields. In fact, one can define the appropriate [[category]] by starting with the category of varieties over a fixed field and then [[localization|localizing]] at all birational equivalences.
