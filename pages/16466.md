## Idea

Deligne's theorem on tensor categories ([Deligne 02](#Deligne02)) establishes [[Tannaka duality]] between sufficiently well-behaved linear [[tensor categories]] in [[characteristic zero]] and [[supergroups]] ("[[supersymmetries]]"), realizing these tensor categories as [[categories of representations]] of these supergroups.

The theorem hence gives a purely mathematical "reason" for the relevance of [[superalgebra]] and [[supergeometry]]. For instance one may wonder why of all possible generalizations of [[commutative algebra]], it is supercommutative superalgebras that are to be singled out (from alternatives such as plain $\mathbb{Z}_2$-[[graded algebras]], or in fact $\mathbb{Z}_n$-graded algebras or general [[noncommutative algebras]] or, the like), as they are singled out notably in theoretical [[physics]] ("[[supersymmetry]]"), but also in mathematical fields such as [[spin geometry]] and [[K-theory]]. On the other hand $k$-linear [[tensor categories]] need little extra motivation, they are on general abstract ground the canonical structure to consider in [[representation theory]]. Hence Deligne' theorem serves to base supercommutative superalgebra on this same general abstract foundation, showing that this is precisly the context in which full $k$-linear tensor categories exhibit full [[Tannaka duality]].

## Statement

Let $k$ be an [[algebraically closed field]] of [[characteristic zero]] (for instance the [[complex numbers]]).

Say that a _$k$-[[tensor category]]_ $\mathcal{A}$ is a [[rigid monoidal category|rigid]] [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]] [[braided monoidal category]] [[enriched category|enriched]] over $k$[[Mod]].

Say that $(\mathcal{A}, \otimes)$ is _[[finitely generated object|finitegy generated]]_ if there exsists an object $E \in \mathcal{A}$ such that every other object is a [[subquotient]] of a [[direct sum]] $E^{\otimes_n}$, for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

For $X \in \mathcal{A}$, $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $\lamba$ a [[partition]] of $n$, say that the value of the [[Schur functor]] $S_\lambda$ on $X$ is

$$
  S_{\lambda}(X) \coloneqq (V_\lambda \otimes X^{\otimes_n})^{S_2}
  \coloneqq 
  \left(
    \underset{g\in S_n}{\sum}
    \rho(g)
  \right)
  \left(
    V_\lambda \otimes X^{\otimes_n}
  \right)
$$

where

* $S_n$ is the [[symmetric group]] on $n$ elements;

* $V_\lambda$ is the [[irreducible representation]] of $S_n$ corresponding to $\lambda$;

* $\rho$ is the diagional [[action]] of $S_n$ on $V_\lambda \otimes X^{\otimes_n}$, coming from the canonical [[permutation]] action on $X^{\otimes_n}$.

Say that $(\mathcal{A}, \otimes)$ is _regular_ if 

1. it is finitely generated;

1. for every [[object]] $X\in \mathcal{A}$ there exists $\lambda$ such that $S_\lambda X = 0$.

Say that a _[[supergroup]]_ is the [[formal dual]] of a [[superalgebra|super]] [[Hopf algebra]] which is supercommutative.

Say that a super-pointing of such $G$ is an [[involution|involutive]] element $\epsilon \in G$, i.e. $\epsilon^2 = 1$.

Say that a super-[[representation]] of $(G,\epsilon)$ is a superrepresentation of $G$ on a [[super vector space]] over $k$ such that $\epsilon$ is taken to the parity endomorphism which is the identity on even graded vectors and multiplication with $(-1)$ on odd-graded vectors.

**Theorem**

The super-[[representation category]] $Rep(G,\epsilon)$ is a regular $k$-[[tensor category]] in the above sense.

Every regular $k$-tensor category is of this form.
