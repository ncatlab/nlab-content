## Idea

Deligne's theorem on tensor categories ([Deligne 02](#Deligne02), recalled as theorem \ref{TheTheorem} below) establishes [[Tannaka duality]] between linear [[tensor categories]] in [[characteristic zero]] subject to just a mild size constraint (subexponential growth, def. \ref{SubexponentialGrowth} below), and [[supergroups]] ("[[supersymmetries]]"), realizing these tensor categories as [[categories of representations]] of these supergroups.

## Relevance

### For supersymmetry

Since the concept of [[tensor categories]] is "god given", much like that of [[natural numbers]], the theorem hence gives a purely mathematical "reason" for the relevance of [[superalgebra]] and [[supergeometry]]. 

For instance one may wonder why of all possible generalizations of [[commutative algebra]], it is supercommutative superalgebras that are to be singled out (from alternatives such as plain $\mathbb{Z}_2$-[[graded algebras]], or in fact $\mathbb{Z}_n$-graded algebras or general [[noncommutative algebras]] or, the like), as they are singled out notably in theoretical [[physics]] ("[[supersymmetry]]"), but also in mathematical fields such as [[spin geometry]] and [[K-theory]]. On the other hand $k$-linear [[tensor categories]] need little extra motivation, they are on general abstract ground the canonical structure to consider in [[representation theory]]. Hence Deligne's theorem serves to base supercommutative superalgebra on this same general abstract foundation, showing that this is precisely the context in which full $k$-linear tensor categories exhibit full [[Tannaka duality]].

More concretely, in [[quantum field theory]], under the [[Wigner classification]], [[fundamental particles]] are identified with [[irreducible representations]] of the [[isometry group]] of the local model of [[spacetime]]. Forming the [[tensor product]] of two such representations corresponds to combining them as two [[subsystems]] of a joint system. Therefore it is natural to demand that physical particle species should form complex-linear [[tensor categories]]. Deligne's theorem then gives that [[supersymmetry]] is the most general context in which this works out. (In physics the irreducible representation in this context here are called the _[[supermultiplets]]_.)

### For Tannaka duality of Hopf algebras
 {#RelevanceForHopfAlgebras}

By [[Tannaka duality]] rigid symmetric monoidal categories in general are [[categories of modules]] of [[triangular Hopf algebras]]. Hence Deligne's theorem here implies that those triangular Hopf algebras whose category of representation has subexponential growth (def. \ref{SubexponentialGrowth} below) are equivalent to supercommutative Hopf algebras. See ([Etingof-Gelaki 02](#EtingofGelaki02)) for more.

## Statement
 {#Statement}

Throughout, let $k$ be an [[algebraically closed field]] of [[characteristic zero]] (for instance the [[complex numbers]]).


### Tensor categories

There are slight variants of what people mean by a "[[tensor category]]". Here we mean precisely the following: 

+-- {: .num_defn #TensorCategory}
###### Definition

For $k$ an [[algebraically closed field]] of [[characteristic zero]], then a _$k$-[[tensor category]]_ $\mathcal{A}$ is an 

1. [[abelian category|abelian]] 

1. [[rigid monoidal category|rigid]] 

1. [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]] 

1. [[braided monoidal category|braided]]

1. [[monoidal category]] 

1. [[enriched category|enriched]] over $k$[[Mod]] = $k$[[Vect]] (i.e. $k$-linear), compatible with the [[Ab-enriched category|Ab-enrichment]] implied from [[abelian category|abelianness]] under $U \colon k Vect \to Ab$

such that 

1. the [[tensor product]] functor $\otimes \colon \mathcal{A} \times \mathcal{A} \longrightarrow \mathcal{A}$ is in both arguments separately

   1. $k Mod$-[[enriched functor|enriched]] (i.e. $k$-linear);

   1. [[exact functor|exact]]


1. $End(1) \simeq k$ (the [[endomorphism ring]] of the [[tensor unit]] coincides with $k$).

=--

([Deligne 02, 0.1](#Deligne02))

We consider now various types of size constraints on tensor categories. The main theorem (theorem \ref{TheTheorem} below) only assumes one of them (subexponential growth, def. \ref{SubexponentialGrowth}), but the others appear in the course of the proof of the theorem.

1. finiteness (def. \ref{FiniteTensorCategory})

1. finite $\otimes$-generation (def. \ref{FiniteTensorGeneration})

1. subexponential growth (def. \ref{SubexponentialGrowth})

Recall the concept of [[length of an object]] in an [[abelian category]], a generalization of the concept of [[dimension]] of a [[free module]]/[[vector space]]. 


+-- {: .num_defn #FiniteTensorCategory} 
###### Definition

A $k$[[tensor category]] (def. \ref{TensorCategory}) is called **finite** (over $k$) if 

1. There are only [[finite number|finitely many]] [[simple objects]] in $C$ (hence it is a [[finite abelian category]]), and each of them admits a [[projective presentation]]. 

1. Each object $a$ is of [[object of finite length|finite length]]; 

1. For any two [[objects]] $a$, $b$ of $C$, the [[hom-object]] ($k$-[[vector space]]) $\hom(a, b)$ has [[finite]] [[dimension]]; 

=--

+-- {: .num_example} 
###### Example

The category of [[finite dimensional vector spaces]] over $k$ is a finite tensor category according to def. \ref{FiniteTensorCategory}. It has a single isomorphism class of [[simple objects]], namely $k$ itself.

Also category of finite dimensional [[super vector spaces]] is a finite tensor category. This has two isomorphism classes of simple objects, $k = k^{1 \vert 0}$ regarded in even degree, and $k^{0\vert 1}$ regarded in odd degree.

=--


The following finiteness condition is useful in the proof of the main theorem, but not necessary for its statement (according to [Deligne 02, bottom of p. 3](#Deligne02)):

+-- {: .num_defn #FiniteTensorGeneration}
###### Definition

A $k$-[[tensor category]] (def. \ref{TensorCategory}) is called _finitely $\otimes$-generated_ if there exists an [[object]] $E \in \mathcal{A}$ such that every other object $X \in \mathcal{A}$ is a [[subquotient]] of a [[direct sum]] of [[tensor products]] $E^{\otimes^n}$, for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$:

$$
  \array{
    && \underset{i}{\oplus} E^{\otimes^{n_i}}
    \\
    && \downarrow
    \\
    X &\hookrightarrow& (\underset{i}{\oplus} E^{\otimes^{n_i}})/Q
  }
  \,.
$$

Such $E$ is called an _$\otimes$-generator_ for $\mathcal{A}$.

=--

([Deligne 02, 0.1](#Deligne02))


The following is the main size constraint needed in the theorem. Notice that it is a "mild" constraint at least in the intuitive sense that it states just a minimum assumption on the expected behaviour of dimension ([[lengh of an object|lengh]]) under tensor powers.

+-- {: .num_defn #SubexponentialGrowth}
###### Definition

A [[tensor category]] $\mathcal{A}$ (def. \ref{TensorCategory}) is said to have _subexponential growth_ if the [[length]] of tensor exponentials is no larger than the exponential of the lenght: for every [[object]] $X$ there exists a [[natural number]] $N_X$ such that $X$ is of [[length of an object|length]] at most $N_X$, and that also all [[tensor product]] powers of $X$ are of length bounded by the corresponding powers of $N_X$:

$$
  \underset{X \in \mathcal{A}}{\forall}
  \underset{N_X \in \mathbb{N}}{\exists}
  \underset{n \in \mathbb{N}}{\forall}
    \;\;
   length(X^{\otimes^n}) \leq (N_X)^n
  \,.
$$

=--

(e.g. [EGNO 15, def. 9.11.1](#EGNO15))

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

The tensor category $k$[[FinVect]] of [[finite dimensional vector spaces]] has subexponential growth (def. \ref{SubexponentialGrowth}), for $N_X = dim(X)$ the [[dimension]] of a vector space $X$, we have

$$
  dim(X^{\otimes^n}) = (dim(X))^n
  \,.
$$

=--



### Schur functors

The first step in the proof of the theorem is the proposition (prop. \ref{LenghtOfObjectIsBounded} below) that all objects that have subexponential growth of lenght (def. \ref{SubexponentialGrowth}) are actually annihilated by some [[Schur functor]] for the [[symmetric group]]. This is a (considerable) generalization of the familiar fact that for every [[finite dimensional vector space]] $V$ there exists an [[symmetric algebra|exterior power]] that vanishes, $\wedge^n V = 0$ (namely for all $n \gt dim (V)$). Similarly, if $V$ is a [[super vector space]] of dimension $(d,p)$, then the combined $(d+1)$st skew-symmetric tensor power and $(p+1)$st symmetric tensor power annihilates it. In this way prop. \ref{LenghtOfObjectIsBounded} below already goes a good way in the direction of establishing that all objects of bounded length, in the sense of def. \ref{LenghtOfObjectIsBounded}, behave like having underlying super-vector spaces.


+-- {: .num_defn #SchurFunctor}
###### Definition

For $(\mathcal{A},\otimes)$ a $k$-[[tensor category]] as in def.\ref{TensorCategory}, for $X \in \mathcal{A}$ an [[object]], for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $\lambda$ a [[partition]] of $n$, regarded as a [[Young diagram]] and hence as a [[representation of the symmetric group]] $V_\lambda$, say that the value of the [[Schur functor]] $S_\lambda$ on $X$ is 

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    S_{\lambda}(X) 
      & \coloneqq 
    (V_\lambda \otimes X^{\otimes_n})^{S_n}
    \\
    & = 
    \left(
      \frac{1}{n!}
      \underset{g\in S_n}{\sum}
      \rho(g)
    \right)
    \left(
      V_\lambda \otimes X^{\otimes_n}
    \right)
  \end{aligned}
$$

where

* $(-)^{S_n}$ is the subobject of [[invariants]];

* $S_n$ is the [[symmetric group]] on $n$ elements;

* $V_\lambda$ is the [[irreducible representation]] of $S_n$ corresponding to $\lambda$;

* $\rho$ is [[diagonal action]] of $S_n$ on $V_\lambda \otimes X^{\otimes_n}$, coming from the canonical [[permutation]] action on $X^{\otimes_n}$;

* $(-)^{S_n}$ denotes the subspace of [[invariants]] under the action $\rho$ 

* the second expression just rewrites the invariants as the image of all elements under [[group averaging]].

([Deligne 02, 1.4](#Deligne02))

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

For $\lambda = (n)$, then $V_{(n)} = k$ equipped with the trivial action of the symmetric group. In this case the corresponding [[Schur functor]] (def. \ref{SchurFunctor}) forms the $n$ [[symmetric power]]

$$
  S_{(n)}(X) = Sym^n(X)
  \,.
$$

For the dual case where $\lambda  (1,1, \cdots, 1)$ then $V_{(1,1,\cdots, 1)} = k$ equipped with the action by multiplication with the [[signature of a permutation]] and the corresponding [[Schur functor]] forms the [[alternating power]]

$$
  S_{(1,1, \cdots, 1)}(X) = \wedge^n X
  \,.
$$

=--


+-- {: .num_prop #LenghtOfObjectIsBounded}
###### Proposition

For [[tensor category]], then the following are equivalent:

1. it has subexponential growth (def. \ref{SubexponentialGrowth});

1. for every object $X$ there exists $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and a [[partition]] $\lambda$ of $n$ such that the corresponding value of the [[Schur functor]], def. \ref{SchurFunctor}, on $X$ vanishes: $S_\lambda(X) = 0$. 


=--

([Deligne 02, prop. 05](#Deligne02))

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

For $V \in SuperVect_k$ a [[super vector space]] of super-dimension $(p\vert q)$, then it is annihilated by the Schur functor corresponding to forming the $p$th antisymmetric and the $q$th symmetric tensor power.

### Fiber functor


### Supergroups

+-- {: .num_defn #Supergroup}
###### Definition

An affine algebraic _[[supergroup]]_ $G$ is the [[formal dual]] of a [[super-commutative Hopf algebra]] $\mathcal{O}(G)$.

=--

We will just say "supergroup" for short in all of the following. We assume throughout that $\mathcal{O}(G)$ is a finitely generated $k$-algebra.

+-- {: .num_defn #ParityAutomorphism}
###### Definition

Given a [[superalgebra]] such as $\mathcal{O}(G)$, its _parity involution_ is the algebra [[automorphism]] which on homogeneously graded elements $a$ of degree $deg(a) \in \{even,odd\} = \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ is multiplication by the degree

$$
  a \mapsto (-1)^{deg(a)}a
  \,.
$$

(e.g. [arXiv:1303.1916, 7.5](http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.1916)). On [[formal duals]] $G$ this induces correspondingly an involutive _parity automorphism_

$$
  par \colon G \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} G
  \,.
$$ 

=--

It is convenient in the following to assume that parity involution is an [[inner automorphism]]:

+-- {: .num_defn #InnerParity}
###### Definition

An _inner parity_ of a [[supergroup]] $G$, def. \ref{Supergroup} is an element $\epsilon \in G_{even}$ (i.e. an algebra homomorphism $\mathcal{O}(G) \to k$), which is [[involution|involutive]] i.e. $\epsilon^2 = 1$ and such that its [[adjoint action]] on $G$ is the parity involution of def. \ref{ParityAutomorphism}.

=--

([Deligne 02, 0.3](#Deligne02))

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

For $G$ an ordinary (affine algebraic) group, regarded as a supergroup with trivial odd-graded part, then every element $\epsilon \in Z(G)$ in the [[center]] defines an inner parity, def. \ref{InnerParity}. 

=--

([Deligne 02, 0.4 i)](#Deligne02))

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

In this sense, specifying an involutive central element in an ordinary group is a faint shadow of genuine supergroup structure. In fact such pairs are being referred to as "supergroups" in ([Müger 06](#Mueger06)).

=--

Demanding the existence of inner parity is not actually a restriction of the theory:

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

For $H$ any supergroup, def. \ref{Supergroup}, and $\mathbb{Z}_2 = \{id,par\}$ acting on it by parity involution, def. \ref{ParityAutomorphism}  then the [[semidirect product]] $\mathbb{Z}_2 \ltimes G$ has inner parity, def. \ref{InnerParity}, given by $\epsilon \coloneqq par \in \mathbb{Z}_2 \hookrightarrow \mathbb{Z}_2 \ltimes G$.

=--

([Deligne 02, 0.4 ii)](#Deligne02))

### Representation categories

+-- {: .num_defn #Superrepresentation}
###### Definition

A _super-[[representation]]_ of a [[supergroup]] $G$, def. \ref{Supergroup}, with inner parity $\epsilon$, def. \ref{InnerParity}, is a [[linear representation]] of $G$ on a [[finite number|finite]] [[dimension|dimensional]] [[vector space]] $V$ over $k$ such that when $V$ is equipped with the grading by $\pm1$-[[eigenspaces]] of $\epsilon$, even/odd elements of $G$ act with even/odd parity on $V$.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #Superrepresentation_Deligne_def}
###### Remark

In ([Deligne 02, p. 3, above 0.4)](#Deligne02)) a super-representation of a supergroup $G$ is defined in a different but equivalent way. The vector space $V$ is considered to come equipped a priori with a grading, making it a [[super vector space]], and the following conditions are required to hold:

1. even/odd elements of $G$ act with even/odd parity on $V$

1. in addition such that $\epsilon$ is taken to the parity endomorphism of $V$ (which is the identity on even graded vectors and multiplication with $(-1)$ on odd-graded vectors).
=--

The given definition \ref{Superrepresentation} is preferable to this one as it doesn't ask for extra [[structure]] on $V$ and then for a property relative to that structure. Also in the following example, one _naturally_ finds that the super vector space on which the ordinary group is represented contains no odd part, and is hence merely an ordinary vector space.

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

For $G$ an ordinary (affine algebraic) group regarded as a supergroup with trivial odd-graded part, and for $\epsilon = 1$ its neutral element taken as the inner parity, then $Rep(G,\epsilon)$ in the sense of def. \ref{Superrepresentation} is just the ordinary [[category of representations]] of $G$.

=--

([Deligne 02, 0.4 i)](#Deligne02))

+-- {: .num_prop #RegularTensorCategoriesOfSuperrepresentations}
###### Proposition

The super-[[representation category]] $Rep(G,\epsilon)$, def. \ref{Superrepresentation} of an algebraic [[supergroup]] $G$, def. \ref{Supergroup}, with inner parity $\epsilon$ is a $k$-[[tensor category]] (def. \ref{TensorCategory}) of subexponential growth (def. \ref{SubexponentialGrowth}).
 
=--

([Deligne 02, 1.21](#Deligne02))

Any finite dimensional [[faithful representation]] (which always exists, [prop.](faithful+representation#AlgebraicGroupHasFinDimFaithfulRepresentations)) serves as a generator ([prop.](faithful+representation#AnyFinDimRepOfAffineAlgebraicGroupOverFieldIsSubquotientsOfFaithfulRep)).

+-- {: .num_theorem #TheTheorem}
###### Theorem

Every $k$-[[tensor category]] $\mathcal{A}$ (def. \ref{TensorCategory}), of subexponential growth (def. \ref{SubexponentialGrowth}) is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to a [[category of representations]] $Rep(G,\epsilon)$, according to example \ref{RegularTensorCategoriesOfSuperrepresentations}, for some [[supergroup]] $G$.
