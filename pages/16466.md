## Idea

Deligne's theorem on tensor categories ([Deligne 02](#Deligne02), recalled as theorem \ref{TheTheorem} below) establishes [[Tannaka duality]] between linear [[tensor categories]] in [[characteristic zero]] subject to just a mild size constraint (subexponential growth, def. \ref{SubexponentialGrowth} below), and [[supergroups]] ("[[supersymmetries]]"), realizing these tensor categories as [[categories of representations]] of these supergroups.


## Relevance

### For supersymmetry
 {#RelevanceForSupersymmetry}

Since the concept of linear [[tensor categories]] arises very naturally in [[mathematics]], the theorem gives a purely mathematical "reason" for the relevance of [[superalgebra]] and [[supergeometry]]. It is reasonable to wonder why of all possible generalizations of [[commutative algebra]], it is [[supercommutative superalgebras]] that are singled out (from alternatives such as plain $\mathbb{Z}/2$-[[graded algebras]], or in fact $\mathbb{Z}/n$-graded algebras or general [[noncommutative algebras]] or the like), as they are notably in theoretical [[physics]] ("[[supersymmetry]]"), but also in mathematical fields such as [[spin geometry]] (e.g. via the relation between [[Majorana spinors]] and supersymmetry, [here](Majorana+spinor#Supersymmetry)) and [[topological K-theory]] (for instance via its incarnation as _[[Karoubi K-theory]]_, or via the descriptioon of [[twisted K-theory]] by _[[super line 2-bundles]]_).

But with $k$-linear [[tensor categories]] appearing on general abstract grounds as the canonical structure to consider in [[representation theory]], Deligne's theorem serves to base supercommutative superalgebra on this same general abstract foundation, showing that this is precisely the context in which full $k$-linear tensor categories exhibit full [[Tannaka duality]].

More concretely, in [[quantum field theory]], under the [[Wigner classification]], [[fundamental particles]] are identified with [[irreducible representations]] of the [[isometry group]] of the local model of [[spacetime]] (which are induced from [[finite dimensional vector space|finite dimensional]] representations of the "[[Wigner classification|Wigner's]] [[little group]]" ([Mackey 68](Wigner+classification#Mackey68)) ). Forming the [[tensor product]] of two such representations corresponds to combining them as two [[subsystems]] of a joint system. Therefore it is natural to demand that physical particle species should form complex-linear [[tensor categories]]. Deligne's theorem then gives that [[supersymmetry]] is the most general context in which this works out. (In physics the irreducible representation in this context here are called the _[[supermultiplets]]_.)



### For Tannaka duality of Hopf algebras
 {#RelevanceForHopfAlgebras}

By [[Tannaka duality]] [[rigid monoidal category]] [[symmetric monoidal categories]] in general are [[categories of modules]] of [[triangular Hopf algebras]]. Hence Deligne's theorem here implies that those triangular Hopf algebras over [[algebraically closed fields]] of [[characteristic zero]] whose category of representation has subexponential growth (def. \ref{SubexponentialGrowth} below) are equivalent to [[supercommutative Hopf algebras]]. See ([Etingof-Gelaki 02](#EtingofGelaki02)) for more.

## Background

This section provides exposition of the necessary background for the statement of Deligne's theorem (theorem \ref{TheTheorem} below).

We start by introducing the basic concepts of [[tensor categories]] along with the basic examples of [[vector spaces]] and [[super vector spaces]]:

* _[Tensor categories](#TensorProductsAndMonoidalCategories)_

This allows to speak of [[commutative algebra]] [[internalization|internal]] to tensor categories. Specializing this to the tensor category of [[super vector spaces]] yields [[supercommutative superalgebras]]. The [[formal duals]] of these are the [[affine variety|affine]] [[super schemes]]. This we discuss in

* _[Commutative algebra in tensor categories and Affine super-spaces](#CommutativeAlgebraInTensorCategories)_

Next we introduce the concept of [[commutative monoids]] equipped with the structure of a [[commutative Hopf algebras]] and explain how these are [[formal duals]] to [[group objects|groups]]. Then we use this to motivate and explain the concept of (affine algebraic) [[supergroups]] as [[formal duals]] to [[commutative Hopf algebras]] internal to the tensor category of [[super vector spaces]], namely [[supercommutative Hopf algebras]]:

* _[(Super-)Groups as (Super-)commutative Hopf algebras](#GroupsAsHopfAlgebras)_

Finally we discuss how under this relation [[linear representations]] of groups correspond to [[comodules]] over their formally dual [[commutative Hopf algebras]], and we introduce the key class of categories of interest here: tensor-[[categories of representations]] of groups and of super-representations of super-groups:

* _[Linear representations as comodules](#LinearRepresentationsAsComodules)_







### Tensor products and Super vector spaces
 {#TensorProductsAndMonoidalCategories}

+-- {: .num_defn #VectorSpaces}
###### Definition

For $k$ a [[field]], we write $Vect_k$ for the [[category]] whose

* [[objects]] are $k$-[[vector spaces]];

* [[morphisms]] are $k$-[[linear functions]] between these.

When the [[ground field]] $k$ is understood or when its precise nature is irrelevant, we will often notationally suppress it and speak of just the category [[Vect]] of vector spaces.

This is the category inside which [[linear algebra]] takes place.

=--

Of course the category [[Vect]] has some special properties. Not only are its objects "linear spaces", but the whole category inherits linear structure of sorts. This is traditionally captured by the following terminology for **[[additive and abelian categories]]**. Notice that there are several different but equivalent ways to state the following properties (discussed behind the relevant links).

+-- {: .num_defn #AdditiveAndAbelianCategories}
###### Definition

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[category]].

1. Say that $\mathcal{C}$ has **[[direct sums]]** if it has [[finite products]] and [[finite coproducts]] and if the canonical comparison  morphism between these is an [[isomorphism]]. We write $V \oplus W$ for the direct sum of two objects of $\mathcal{C}$.

1. Say that $\mathcal{C}$ is an **[[additive category]]** if it has [[direct sums]] and in addition it is [[Ab-enriched category|enriched in abelian groups]], meaning that every [[hom-set]] is equipped with the structure of an [[abelian group]] such that [[composition]] of morphisms is a [[bilinear map]].

1. Say that $\mathcal{C}$ is an **[[abelian category]]** if it is an [[additive category]] and has property that its [[monomorphisms]] are precisely the inclusions of [[kernels]] and its [[epimorphisms]] are precisely the projections onto [[cokernels]].

=--

We also make the following definition of $k$-linear category, but notice that conventions differ as to which extra properties beyond [[Vect]]-[[enriched category|enrichment]] to require on a linear category:


+-- {: .num_defn #LinearCategory}
###### Definition

For $k$ a [[field]] (or more generally just a [[commutative ring]]), call a [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$ a **$k$-[[linear category]]** if

1. it is an [[abelian category]] (def. \ref{AdditiveAndAbelianCategories});

1. its [[hom-sets]] have the structure of $k$-[[vector spaces]] (generally $k$-[[modules]]) such that [[composition]] of morphisms in $\mathcal{C}$ is a [[bilinear map]]

and the underlying additive [[abelian group]] structure of these [[hom-spaces]] is that of the underlying [[abelian category]].

In other words, a $k$-linear category is an [[abelian category]] with the additional structure of a [[Vect]]-[[enriched category]] (generally $k$[[Mod]]-enriched) such that the underlying [[Ab-enriched category|Ab-enrichment]] according to def. \ref{AdditiveAndAbelianCategories} is obtained from the $Vect$-enrichment under the [[forgetful functor]] $Vect \to Ab$.

A [[functor]] between $k$-linear categories is called a **$k$-[[linear functor]]** if its component functions on [[hom-sets]] are [[linear maps]] with respect to the given $k$-linear structure, hence if it is a [[Vect]]-[[enriched functor]].

=--

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

The category [[Vect]]${}_k$ of [[vector spaces]] (def. \ref{VectorSpaces}) is a $k$-[[linear category]] according to def. \ref{LinearCategory}.

Here the abstract [[direct sum]] is the usual direct sum of [[vector spaces]], whence the name of the general concept.

For $V,W$ two $k$-vector spaces, the vector space structure on the [[hom-set]] $Hom_{Vect}(V,W)$ of [[linear maps]] $\phi \colon V \to W$ is given by "pointwise" multiplication and addition of functions:

$$
  (c_1 \phi_1 + c_2 \phi_2)
  \;\colon\,
   v \;\mapsto\;
   c_1 \phi_1(v) + c_2 \phi_2(v)
$$

for all $c_1, c_2 \in k$ and $\phi_1, \phi_2 \in Hom_{Vect}(V,W)$.


=--

Recall the basic construction of the [[tensor product of vector spaces]]:

+-- {: .num_defn #TensorProductOfVectorSpaces}
###### Definition

Given two [[vector spaces]] over some [[field]] $k$,  $V_1, V_2 \in Vect_k$, their [[tensor product of vector spaces]] is the vector space denoted

$$
  V_1 \otimes_k V_2 \;\in\; Vect
$$

whose elements are [[equivalence classes]] of  [[tuples]] of elements $(v_1,v_2)$ with $v_i \in V_i$, for the [[equivalence relation]] given by

$$
  (c v_1 , v_2) \;\sim\; (v_1, c v_2)
$$

$$
  (v_1 + v'_1 , v_2) \; \sim \; (v_1,v_2) + (v'_1, v_2)
$$

$$
  (v_1 , v_2 + v'_2) \; \sim \; (v_1,v_2) + (v_1, v'_2)
$$

More abstractly this means that the [[tensor product of vector spaces]] is the vector space characterized by the fact that

1. it receives a [[bilinear map]]

   $$
     V_1 \times V_2 \longrightarrow V_1 \otimes V_2
   $$

   (out of the [[Cartesian product]] of the underlying sets)

1. any other [[bilinear map]] of the form

   $$
     V_1 \times V_2 \longrightarrow V_3
   $$

   factors through the above bilinear map via a unique [[linear map]]

   $$
     \array{
        V_1 \times V_2 &\overset{bilinear}{\longrightarrow}& V_3
        \\
        \downarrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\exists ! \, linear}}
         \\
         V_1 \otimes_k V_2
     }
   $$

=--

The existence of the [[tensor product of vector spaces]], def. \ref{TensorProductOfVectorSpaces}, equips the category [[Vect]] of vector spaces with extra structure, which is a "[[categorification]]" of the familiar structure of a [[semi-group]]. One also says "[[monoid]]" for [[semi-group]] and therefore [[categories]] equipped with a [[tensor product]] operation are also called  _[[monoidal categories]]_:


+-- {: .num_defn #MonoidalCategory}
###### Definition

A **[[monoidal category]]** is a [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$ equipped with

1. a [[functor]]

   $$
      \otimes
        \;\colon\;
      \mathcal{C} \times \mathcal{C}
       \longrightarrow
      \mathcal{C}
   $$

   out of the [[product category]] of $\mathcal{C}$ with itself, called the **[[tensor product]]**,

1. an object

   $$
     1 \in \mathcal{C}
   $$

   called the **[[unit object]]** or **[[tensor unit]]**,

1. a [[natural isomorphism]]

   $$
     a
       \;\colon\;
     ((-)\otimes (-)) \otimes (-)
       \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
     (-) \otimes ((-)\otimes(-))
   $$

   called the **[[associator]]**,

1. {#MonoidalCategoryUnitors} a [[natural isomorphism]]

   $$
     \ell
       \;\colon\;
     (1 \otimes (-))
       \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
     (-)
   $$

   called the **[[left unitor]]**, and a natural isomorphism

   $$
     r \;\colon\; (-) \otimes 1 \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} (-)
   $$

   called the **[[right unitor]]**,

such that the following two kinds of [[commuting diagram|diagrams commute]], for all objects involved:

1. **triangle identity**:

   $$
     \array{
        & (x \otimes 1) \otimes y &\stackrel{a_{x,1,y}}{\longrightarrow} & x \otimes (1 \otimes y)
         \\
         & {}_{\rho_x \otimes 1_y}\searrow
         && \swarrow_{1_x \otimes \lambda_y}
         &
        \\
        &&
        x \otimes y
        &&
     }
   $$


1. the **[[pentagon identity]]**:

   $$
     \array{
       && (w \otimes x) \otimes (y \otimes z)
       \\
       & {}^{\mathllap{\alpha_{w \otimes x, y, z}}}\nearrow
        &&
       \searrow^{\mathrlap{\alpha_{w,x,y \otimes z}}}
       \\
       ((w \otimes x ) \otimes y) \otimes z
        && &&
       (w \otimes (x \otimes (y \otimes z)))
       \\
       {}^{\mathllap{\alpha_{w,x,y}} \otimes id_z }\downarrow
        && &&
       \uparrow^{\mathrlap{ id_w \otimes \alpha_{x,y,z} }}
       \\
       (w \otimes (x \otimes y)) \otimes z
         && \underset{\alpha_{w,x \otimes y, z}}{\longrightarrow} &&
       w \otimes ( (x \otimes y) \otimes z )
     }
   $$


=--

As expected, we have the following basic example:

+-- {: .num_example #VectAsAMonoidalCategory}
###### Example

For $k$ a [[field]], the category [[Vect]]${}_k$ of $k$-[[vector spaces]] becomes a [[monoidal category]] (def. \ref{MonoidalCategory}) as follows

* the abstract [[tensor product]] is the [[tensor product of vector spaces]] $\otimes_k$ from def. \ref{TensorProductOfVectorSpaces};

* the [[tensor unit]] is the [[field]] $k$ itself, regarded as a 1-dimensional vector space over itself;

* the [[associator]] is the map that on representing [[tuples]] acts as

  $$
    \alpha_{V_{1}, V_2, V_3}
       \;\colon\;
   ((v_1, v_2), v_3) \mapsto (v_1, (v_2,v_3))
  $$

* the left [[unitor]] is the map that on representing [[tuples]] is given by

  $$
    \ell_{V} \colon (k,v) \mapsto k v
  $$

  and the right unitor is similarly given by

  $$
    r_V \colon (v,k) \mapsto k v
    \,.
  $$

That this satisifes the [[pentagon identity]] (def. \ref{MonoidalCategory}) and the left and right unit identities is immediate on representing tuples.

=--

But the point of the abstract definition of [[monoidal categories]] is that there are also more exotic examples. The followig one is just a minimal enrichment of example \ref{VectAsAMonoidalCategory}, and yet it will be important.

+-- {: .num_example #GradedVectorSpacesAsAMonoidaCategory}
###### Example

Let $G$ be a [[group]] (or in fact just a [[monoid]]/[[semi-group]]). A **$G$-[[graded vector space]]** $V$ is a [[direct sum]] of vector spaces labeled by the elements in $G$:

$$
  V = \underset{g \in G}{\oplus} V_g
  \,.
$$

A [[homomorphism]]

$$
  \phi \;\colon\; V \longrightarrow W
$$

of $G$-graded vector spaces is a [[linear map]] that respects this direct sum structure, hence equivalently a [[direct sum]] of [[linear maps]]

$$
  \phi_g \;\colon\; V_g \longrightarrow W_g
$$

for all $g \in G$, such that

$$
  \phi = \underset{g \in G}{\oplus} \phi_g
  \,.
$$

This defines a [[category]], denoted $Vect^G$. Equip this category with a [[tensor product]] which on the underlying vector spaces is just the [[tensor product of vector spaces]] from def. \ref{TensorProductOfVectorSpaces}, equipped with the $G$-grading which is obtained by multiplying degree labels in $G$:

$$
  (V \otimes W)_g
    \;\coloneqq\;
  \underset{{g_1, g_2 \in G} \atop {g_1 g_2 = g}}{\oplus}
   V_{g_1} \otimes_k V_{g_2}
  \,.
$$

The [[tensor unit]] for the tensor product is the ground field $k$, regarded as being in the degree of the [[neutral element]] $e \in G$

$$
  1_g
  \;=\;
  \left\{
    \array{
      k & | g = e
      \\
      0 & | otherwise
    }
  \right.
  \,.
$$

The [[associator]] and [[unitors]] are just those of the monoidal structure on plain vector spaces, from example \ref{VectAsAMonoidalCategory}.

=--

One advantage of abstracting the concept of a [[monoidal category]] is that it allows to prove general statements uniformly for all kinds of tensor products, familar ones and more exotic ones. The following lemma \ref{kel1} and remark \ref{CoherenceForMonoidalCategories} are two important such statements.

+-- {: .num_lemma #kel1}
###### Lemma
**([Kelly 64](#Kelly64))**

Let $(\mathcal{C}, \otimes, 1)$ be a [[monoidal category]], def. \ref{MonoidalCategory}. Then the left and right [[unitors]] $\ell$ and $r$ satisfy the following conditions:

1. $\ell_1 = r_1 \;\colon\; 1 \otimes 1 \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} 1$;

1. for all objects $x,y \in \mathcal{C}$ the following [[commuting diagram|diagrams commutes]]:

   $$
     \array{
       (1 \otimes x) \otimes y  & &
       \\
       {}^\mathllap{\alpha_{1, x, y}} \downarrow

       & \underset{\ell_{x \otimes y}}{\longrightarrow} & x \otimes y

   and

+-- {: .num_remark #CoherenceForMonoidalCategories}
###### Remark

Just as for an [[associative algebra]] it is sufficient to demand $1 a = a$ and $a 1 = a$ and $(a b) c = a (b c)$ in order to have that expressions of arbitrary length may be re-bracketed at will, so there is a _[[coherence theorem for monoidal categories]]_ which states that all ways of freely composing the [[unitors]] and [[associators]] in a [[monoidal category]] (def. \ref{MonoidalCategory}) to go from one expression to another will coincide. Accordingly, much as one may drop the notation for the bracketing in an [[associative algebra]] altogether, so one may, with due care, reason about monoidal categories without always making all unitors and associators explicit.

(Here the qualifier "freely" means informally that we must not use any non-formal identification between objects, and formally it means that the diagram in question must be in the image of a [[strong monoidal functor]] from a _free_ monoidal category. For example if in a particular monoidal category it so happens that the object $X \otimes (Y \otimes Z)$ is actually _equal_ to $(X \otimes Y)\otimes Z$, then the various ways of going from one expression to another using only associators _and_ this "accidental" equality no longer need to coincide.)

=--

The above discussion makes it clear that a [[monoidal category]] is like a [[monoid]]/[[semi-group]], but "[[categorified]]". Accordingly we may consider additional properties of [[monoids]]/[[semi-groups]] and correspondingly lift them to monoidal categories. A key such property is _[[commutative ring|commutativity]]_. But while for a monoid commutativity is just an extra [[property]], for a [[monoidal category]] it involves choices of commutativity-[[isomorphisms]] and hence is [[stuff, structure and property|extra structure]].
We will see [below](#SuperGroupsAsSuperHopfAlgebras) that this is the very source of [[superalgebra]].

The [[categorification]] of "commutativity" comes in two stages: [[braiding]] and [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric braiding]].

+-- {: .num_defn #BraidedMonoidalCategory}

(for all [[objects]] $x,y in \mathcal{C}$) called the **[[braiding]]**, such that the following two kinds of [[commuting diagram|diagrams commute]] for all [[objects]] involved ("hexagon identities"):

In analogy to the [[coherence theorem for monoidal categories]] (remark \ref{CoherenceForMonoidalCategories}) there is a [[coherence theorem for symmetric monoidal categories]] (def. \ref{SymmetricMonoidalCategory}), saying that every diagram built freely (see remark \ref{SymmetricMonoidalCategoriesCoherenceTheorem}) from [[associators]], [[unitors]] and [[braidings]] such that both sides of the diagram correspond to the same [[permutation]] of objects, coincide.

Consider the simplest non-trivial special case of $G$-[[graded vector spaces]] from example \ref{GradedVectorSpacesAsAMonoidaCategory}, the case where $G = \mathbb{Z}/2$ is the [[cyclic group of order two]].

+-- {: .num_example #Z2Zgradedvectorspaces}
###### Example

A **$\mathbb{Z}/2$-[[graded vector space]]** is a [[direct sum]] of two vector spaces

$$
  V = V_{even} \oplus V_{odd}
  \,,
$$

where we think of $V_{even}$ as the summand that is graded by the [[neutral element]] in $\mathbb{Z}/2$, and of $V_{odd}$ as being the summand that is graded by the single non-trivial element.

A [[homomorphism]] of $\mathbb{Z}/2$-graded vector spaces

$$
  f \;\colon\; V_1 \longrightarrow V_2
$$

is a [[linear map]] of the underlying vector spaces that respects the grading, hence equivalently a pair of linear maps

$$
  f_{even} \;\colon\; (V_1)_{even} \longrightarrow (V_1)_{even}
$$

$$
  f_{odd} \;\colon\; (V_1)_{odd} \longrightarrow (V_1)_{odd}
$$

between then summands in even degree and in odd degree, respectively:

$$
  f = f_{even} \oplus f_{odd}
  \,.
$$

The [[tensor product]] of $\mathbb{Z}/2$-graded vector space is the [[tensor product of vector spaces]] of the underlying vector spaces, but with the grading obtained from multiplying the original gradings in $\mathbb{Z}/2$. Hence

$$
  (V_1 \otimes V_2)_{even}
    \;\coloneqq\;
  \left((V_1)_{even} \otimes (V_2)_{even}\right)
    \oplus
  \left((V_1)_{odd} \otimes (V_2)_{odd}\right)

     \,
     (v_2,v_1)
     \,.
   $$

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

For $(\mathcal{C}, \otimes, 1)$ a [[monoidal category]], write

$$
  (Line(\mathcal{C}), \otimes, 1)
    \hookrightarrow
  (\mathcal{C}, \otimes, 1)
$$

for the [[full subcategory]] on those $L \in \mathcal{C}$ which are [[invertible objects]] under the [[tensor product]], i.e. such that there is an object $L^{-1} \in \mathcal{C}$ with $L \otimes L^{-1} \simeq 1$ and $L^{-1} \otimes L \simeq 1$. Since the [[tensor unit]] is clearly in $Line(L)$ (with $1^{-1} \simeq 1$) and since with $L_1, L_2 \in Line(\mathcal{C}) \hookrightarrow \mathcal{C}$ also $L_1 \otimes L_2 \in Line(\mathcal{C})$ (with $(L_1 \otimes L_2)^{-1} \simeq L_2^{-1} \otimes L_1^{-1}$) the [[monoidal category]] structure on $\mathcal{C}$ restricts to $Line(\mathcal{C})$.


Accordingly any [[braiding]] on $(\mathcal{C}, \otimes,1)$ restricts to a braiding on $(Line(\mathcal{C}), \otimes, 1)$. Hence it is sufficient to show that there is an essentially unique non-trivial symmetric braiding on $(Line(\mathcal{C}), \otimes, 1)$, and that this is the restriction of a braiding on $(\mathcal{C}, \otimes, 1)$.

Now $(Line(\mathcal{C}, \otimes , 1))$ is necessarily a [[groupoid]] (the "[[Picard groupoid of a monoidal category|Picard groupoid]]" of $\mathcal{C}$) and in fact is what is called a _[[2-group]]_. As such we may regard it equivalently as a [[homotopy 1-type]] with group structure, and as such it it is equivalent to its [[delooping]]

$$
  B_\otimes Line(\mathcal{C})
$$

regarded as a [[pointed homotopy type]]. (See at _[[looping and delooping]]_).

The [[Grothendieck group]] of $(\mathcal{C}, \otimes, 1)$ is

$$
  \pi_0(Line(\mathcal{C}))
    \simeq
  \pi_1(B Line(\mathcal{C}))
$$

the [[fundamental group]] of the delooping space.

Now a symmetric braiding on $Line(\mathcal{C})$ is precisely the structure that makes it a [[symmetric 2-group]] which is equivalently the structure of a second [[delooping]] $B^2 Line(\mathcal{C})$ (for the braiding) and then a third delooping $B^3 Line(\mathcal{C})$ (for the symmetry), regarded as a [[pointed homotopy type]].

This way we have rephrased the question equivalently as a question about the possible [[k-invariants]] of spaces of this form.

Now in the case at hand, $Line(Vect^{\mathbb{Z}/2})$ has precisely two [[isomorphism classes]] of objects, namely the [[ground field]] $k$ itself, regarded as being in even degree and regarded as being in odd degree. We write $k^{1\vert 0}$ and $k^{0 \vert 1}$ for these, respectively. By the rules of the tensor product of [[graded vector spaces]] we have

$$
  k^{1\vert 0} \otimes_k k^{1\vert 0} \simeq k^{1\vert 0}
$$

$$
  k^{1\vert 0} \otimes_k k^{0\vert 1} \simeq k^{0\vert 1}
$$

and

$$
  k^{0 \vert 1} \otimes_k k^{0 \vert 1} \simeq k^{1 \vert 0}
  \,.
$$

In other words

$$
  \pi_0(Line(Vect^{\mathbb{Z}/2})) \simeq \mathbb{Z}/2
  \,.
$$

Now under the above homotopical identification the non-trivial braiding is identified with the elements

$$
  1 =
  k^{1 \vert 0}
     \simeq
  k^{0\vert 1} \otimes_k k^{0 \vert 1}
    \stackrel{\tau^{super}_{k^{0\vert 1}, k^{0 \vert 1}}}{\longrightarrow}
  k^{0\vert 1} \otimes_k k^{0\vert 1}
    \simeq
  k^{1 \vert 0}
  = 1
$$

Due to the [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetry]] condition (def. \ref{SymmetricMonoidalCategory}) we have

$$
  (\tau^{super}_{k^{0\vert 1}, k^{0 \vert 1}})^2 = id
$$

which implies that

$$
  \tau^{super}_{k^{0\vert 1}, k^{0 \vert 1}}
  \in
  \{+ id, -id\}
  \,.
$$

Therefore for classifying just the symmetric braidings, it is sufficient to restrict the [[hom-spaces]] in $Line(Vect^{\mathbb{Z}/2})$ from being either $k$ or empty, to [[hom-sets]] being $\mathbb{Z}/2 = \{+1-1\} \hookrightarrow k$ or empty. Write $\widetilde{Line}(Vect^{\mathbb{Z}/2})$ for the resulting [[2-group]].

In conclusion then the [[equivalence classes]] of possible [[k-invariants]] of $B^3 Line(Vect^{\mathbb{Z}/2})$, hence the possible symmetric braiding on $Line(Vect^{\mathbb{Z}/2})$ are in the degree-4 [[ordinary cohomology]] of the [[Eilenberg-MacLane space]] $K(\mathbb{Z}/2,3)$ with [[coefficients]] in $\mathbb{Z}/2$. One finds (...)


$$
  H^4(K(\mathbb{Z}/2, 3), \mathbb{Z}/2)

It has been suggested (in [Kapranov 15](super+algebra#Kapranov15)) that this and other phenomena are evidence that in the wider context of [[homotopy theory]]/[[stable homotopy theory]] super-grading (and hence [[superalgebra]]) is to be regarded as but a shadow of grading in [[higher algebra]] over the [[sphere spectrum]]. Notice that the [[sphere spectrum]] is just the analog of the group of [[integers]] in [[stable homotopy theory]].

###### Definition

Given a [[symmetric monoidal category]] $\mathcal{C}$ with [[tensor product]] $\otimes$ (def. \ref{SymmetricMonoidalCategory}) it is called a **[[closed monoidal category]]** if for each $Y \in \mathcal{C}$ the functor $Y \otimes(-)\simeq (-)\otimes Y$ has a [[right adjoint]], denoted $hom(Y,-)$

$$
  \mathcal{C}
    \underoverset
      {\underset{hom(Y,-)}{\longrightarrow}}
      {\overset{(-) \otimes Y}{\longleftarrow}}
      {\bot}
  \mathcal{C}
  \,,
$$

hence if there are [[natural bijections]]

$$
  Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(X \otimes Y, Z)
   \;\simeq\;
  Hom_{\mathcal{C}}{C}(X, hom(Y,Z))
$$

for all objects $X,Z \in \mathcal{C}$.

Since for the case that $X = 1$ is the [[tensor unit]] of $\mathcal{C}$ this means that

$$
  Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(1,hom(Y,Z)) \simeq Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(Y,Z)
  \,,
$$

the object $hom(Y,Z) \in \mathcal{C}$ is an enhancement of the ordinary [[hom-set]] $Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(Y,Z)$ to an object in $\mathcal{C}$.
Accordingly, it is also called the **[[internal hom]]** between $Y$ and $Z$.

=--


In a [[closed monoidal category]], the adjunction isomorphism between [[tensor product]] and [[internal hom]] even holds internally:

+-- {: .num_prop #TensorHomAdjunctionIsoInternally}
###### Proposition

In a [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]] [[closed monoidal category]] (def. \ref{ClosedMonoidalCategory}) there are [[natural isomorphisms]]

$$
  hom(X \otimes Y, Z)
   \;\simeq\;
  hom(X, hom(Y,Z))
$$

whose image under $Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(1,-)$ are the defining [[natural bijections]] of def. \ref{ClosedMonoidalCategory}.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let $A \in \mathcal{C}$ be any object. By applying the defining natural bijections twice, there are composite natural bijections

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(A , hom(X \otimes Y, Z))
    & \simeq
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(A \otimes (X \otimes Y), Z)
    \\
    & \simeq
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}((A \otimes X)\otimes Y, Z)
    \\
    & \simeq
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(A \otimes X, hom(Y,Z))
    \\
    & \simeq
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(A, hom(X,hom(Y,Z)))
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

Since this holds for all $A$, the [[Yoneda lemma]] (the [[fully faithful functor|fully faithfulness]] of the [[Yoneda embedding]]) says that there is an isomorphism $hom(X\otimes Y, Z) \simeq hom(X,hom(Y,Z))$. Moreover, by taking $A = 1$ in the above and using the left [[unitor]] isomorphisms $A \otimes (X \otimes Y) \simeq X \otimes Y$ and $A\otimes X \simeq X$  we get a [[commuting diagram]]

We say that $A^\ast$ is the right [[dual object]] to $A$. Similarly a left dual for $A$ is an object $A^\ast$ and the structure of $A$ as a right dual of $A^\ast$. If $(\mathcal{C}, \otimes, 1)$ is equipped with the structure of a [[braided monoidal category]], then every right dual is canonically also a left dual.

Let

$$
  FinVect_k \hookrightarrow Vect_k
$$

be the [[full subcategory]] of that of all [[vector spaces]] (over the given [[ground field]] $k$) on those which are **[[finite dimensional vector spaces]]**.

Clearly the [[tensor product of vector spaces]] (def. \ref{TensorProductOfVectorSpaces}) restricts to those of [[finite number|finite]] [[dimension]], and so there is the induced [[monoidal category]] structure from example \ref{VectAsAMonoidalCategory}

$$
  (FinVect_k, \otimes = \otimes_k, 1 = k )
   \hookrightarrow
  (Vect_k, \otimes_k, k)
  \,.
$$

This is a a [[rigid monoidal category]] (def. \ref{DualizableObject}) in that for $V$ any [[finite dimensional vector spaces]], its ordinary linear [[dual vector space]]

$$
  V^\ast \coloneqq hom(V,k)
$$

is a  [[dual object]] in the abstract sense of def. \ref{DualizableObject}.

Here the evaluation map is literally the defining [[evaluation]] map of linear duals (whence the name of the abstract concept)

$$
  ev_{V} \;\colon\;  V^\ast \otimes_k V \simeq hom(V,k) \otimes_k k \overset{}{\longrightarrow} k
$$
$$
  ev
    \;\colon\;
  (V \stackrel{\phi}{\to} k, v)
  \;\;\mapsto \;\;
  \phi(v)
  \,.
$$

The co-evaluation map

$$
  i_V
    \;\colon\;
  k \longrightarrow V \otimes V^\ast
$$

is the linear map that sends $1 \in k$ to $id_V \in End(V) \simeq V \otimes_k V^\ast$ under the canonical identification of $V \otimes_k V^\ast$ with the linear space of [[linear map|linear]] [[endomorphisms]] of $V$.

If we choose a [[linear basis]] $\{e_i\}$ for $V$ and a corresponding dual bases $\{e^i\}$ of $V^\ast$, then the evaluation map is given by

$$
  ev \;\colon\; (e^i, e_j) \mapsto e^i(e_j) =  \delta^i_j
$$

(with the [[Kronecker delta]] on the right) and the co-evaluation map is given by

$$
  1 \mapsto \underset{i}{\sum} (e_i,  e^i)
  \,.
$$

In this perspective the [[triangle identities]] are the statements that

$$
  \underset{j}{\sum} e^i(e_j) e^j = e^i
$$

and

$$
  \underset{j}{\sum} e_j e^j(e_i) = e_i

$$

of the [[symmetric monoidal category]] of [[super vector spaces]] from example \ref{CategoryOfSuperVectorSpaces}, on those of finite total dimension is a [[rigid monoidal category]].

Here we say that a [[super vector space]] $V$ has [[dimension]]

$$
  (p\vert q)
  \in \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}
$$

if its even part has dimension $p$ and its odd part has dimension $q$:

The [[dual object]] of such a finite dimensional super vector space is just the linear [[dual vector space]] as in example \ref{FiniteDimensionalVectorSpaces}, equipped with the evident grading:

$$
  V = V_{even} \oplus V_{odd}

There are many [[monoidal categories]] whose "[[tensor product]]" operation is quite unlike the [[tensor product of vector spaces]]. Hence one says _[[tensor category]]_ for monoidal categories that are also $k$-[[linear categories]] and such that the tensor product functor  suitably reflects that linear structure.
There are slight variants of what people mean by a "[[tensor category]]". Here we mean precisely the following:

+-- {: .num_defn #TensorCategory}
###### Definition

For $k$ a [[field]], then a **$k$-[[tensor category]]** $\mathcal{A}$ is an

1. [[essentially small category|essentially small]]

1. [[linear category|k-linear]] (def. \ref{LinearCategory})

1. [[rigid monoidal category|rigid]] (def. \ref{DualizableObject})

1. [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]] (def. \ref{SymmetricMonoidalCategory})

1. [[monoidal category]] (def. \ref{MonoidalCategory})

such that

1. the [[tensor product]] functor $\otimes \colon \mathcal{A} \times \mathcal{A} \longrightarrow \mathcal{A}$ is in both arguments separately

   1. $k$-linear (def. \ref{LinearCategory});

   1. [[exact functor|exact]].


1. $End(1) \simeq k$ (the [[endomorphism ring]] of the [[tensor unit]] coincides with $k$).

=--

In this form this is considered in ([Deligne 02, 0.1](#Deligne02)).

We consider now various types of size constraints on tensor categories. The Tannaka reconstruction theorem (theorem \ref{TheTheorem} below) only assumes one of them (subexponential growth, def. \ref{SubexponentialGrowth}), but the others appear in the course of the proof of the theorem.

1. finiteness (def. \ref{FiniteTensorCategory})

1. finite $\otimes$-generation (def. \ref{FiniteTensorGeneration})

1. subexponential growth (def. \ref{SubexponentialGrowth})

###### Definition

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an [[abelian category]].
Given an [[object]] $X \in \mathcal{C}$, then a _[[Jordan-Hölder sequence]]_ or _[[composition series]]_ for $X$ is a finite [[filtration]], i.e. a finite sequence of [[subobject]] unclusions into $X$, starting with the [[zero objects]]

$$
  0 = X_0 \hookrightarrow X_1 \hookrightarrow \cdots \hookrightarrow X_{n-1} \hookrightarrow X_n = X
$$

such that at each stage $i$ the [[quotient]] $X_i/X_{i-1}$ (i.e. the [[coimage]] of the [[monomorphism]] $X_{i-1} \hookrightarrow X_i$) is a [[simple object]] of $\mathcal{C}$.

If a Jordan-Hölder sequence for $X$ exists at all, then $X$ is said to be of _finite length_.

1. Each object $a$ is of [[object of finite length|finite length]];

###### Definition

A $k$-[[tensor category]] (def. \ref{TensorCategory}) is called _finitely $\otimes$-generated_ if there exists an [[object]] $E \in \mathcal{A}$ such that every other object $X \in \mathcal{A}$ is a [[subquotient]] of a [[direct sum]] of [[tensor products]] $E^{\otimes^n}$, for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$:

Such $E$ is called an _$\otimes$-generator_ for $\mathcal{A}$.

([Deligne 02, 0.1](#Deligne02))


The following is the main size constraint needed in the theorem. Notice that it is a "mild" constraint at least in the intuitive sense that it states just a minimum assumption on the expected behaviour of dimension ([[length of an object|length]]) under tensor powers.

###### Definition

A [[tensor category]] $\mathcal{A}$ (def. \ref{TensorCategory}) is said to have **subexponential growth*** if the [[length]] of tensor exponentials is no larger than the exponential of the length: for every [[object]] $X$ there exists a [[natural number]] $N_X$ such that $X$ is of [[length of an object|length]] at most $N_X$, and that also all [[tensor product]] powers of $X$ are of length bounded by the corresponding powers of $N_X$:

$$

  \,
  \underset{N_X \in \mathbb{N}}{\exists}

### Commutative algebra in tensor categories and Affine super-spaces
 {#CommutativeAlgebraInTensorCategories}

The key idea of [[supercommutative superalgebra]] is that it is nothing but plain [[commutative algebra]] but "[[internalization|internalized]]" not in ordinary [[vector spaces]], but in [[super vector spaces]]. This is made precise by def. \ref{MonoidsInMonoidalCategory} and ef. \ref{SupercommutativeSuperalgebra} below.

The key idea then of [[supergeometry]] is to define super-[[spaces]] to be spaces whose [[algebras of functions]] are [[supercommutative superalgebras]]. This is not the case for any "ordinary" space such as a [[topological space]] or a [[smooth manifold]]. But these spaces may be _characterized dually_ via their algebras of functions, and hence it makes sense to generalize the latter.

For [[smooth manifolds]] the [[duality]] statement is the following:

+-- {: .num_prop #EmbeddingOfSmoothManifoldsIntoRAlgebras}
###### Proposition
**([[embedding of smooth manifolds into formal duals of R-algebras]])**

The [[functor]]

$$
  C^\infty(-) \;\colon\; SmoothMfd \longrightarrow Alg_{\mathbb{R}}^{op}
$$

which sends a [[smooth manifold]] ([[finite number|finite]] [[dimension|dimensional]], [[paracompact topological space|paracompact]], [[second countable topological space|second countable]]) to (the [[formal dual]] of) its $\mathbb{R}$-[[associative algebra|algebra]] of [[smooth functions]] is a [[full and faithful functor]].

In other words, for two [[smooth manifolds]] $X,Y$ there is a [[natural bijection]] between the [[smooth functions]] $X \to Y$ and the $\mathbb{R}$-[[associative algebra|algebra]] [[homomorphisms]] $C^\infty(X)\leftarrow C^\infty(Y)$.

=--

A **proof** is for instance in ([Kolar-Slovak-Michor 93, lemma 35.8, corollaries 35.9, 35.10](embedding+of+smooth+manifolds+into+formal+duals+of+R-algebras#KolarSlovakMichor93)).

This says that we may _identify_ [[smooth manifolds]] as the  "[[formal duals]]" of certain [[associative algebras]], namely those in the image of the above full embedding. Accordingly then, any larger class of associative algebras than this may be thought of as the class of [[formal duals]] to a generalized kind of manifold, defined thereby. Given any associative algebra $A$, then we may think of it as representing a space
$Spec(A)$ which is such that it has $A$ as its [[algebra of functions]].

This [[duality]] between certain  [[spaces]] and their [[algebras of functions]] is profound. In [[physics]] it has always been used implicitly, in fact it was so ingrained into theoretical physics that it took much effort to abstract away from [[coordinate system|coordinate functions]] to discover global [[Riemannian geometry]] in the guise of"[[general relativity]]". As mathematics, an early prominent duality theorem is [[Gelfand duality]] (between [[topological spaces]] and [[C*-algebras]]) which served as motivation for the very definition of [[algebraic geometry]], where [[affine schemes]] are nothing but the [[formal duals]] of [[commutative rings]]/[[commutative algebras]]. Passing to [[non-commutative algebras]] here yields [[non-commutative geometry]], and so forth. In great generality this duality between spaces and their function algebras appears as "[[Isbell duality]]" between [[presheaves]] and [[copresheaves]].

In [[supergeometry]] we are concerned with spaces that are formally dual to associative algebras which are "very mildly" non-commutative, namely [[supercommutative superalgebras]]. These are in fact [[commutative algebras]] when viewed internal to [[super vector spaces]]
(def. \ref{SupercommutativeSuperalgebra} below).
The corresponding [[formal dual]] spaces are, depending on some technical details, _[[super schemes]]_ or _[[supermanifolds]]_. In the [[physics]] literature, such spaces are usually just called _[[superspaces]]_.

We now make this precise.

Example \ref{MonoidsInVectAreAssociativeAlgebras} motivates the following definition:

+-- {: .num_defn #SupercommutativeSuperalgebra}
###### Definition

A **[[supercommutative superalgebra]]** is a [[commutative monoid]] (def. \ref{MonoidsInMonoidalCategory}) in the [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal]] [[category of super vector spaces]] (def. \ref{CategoryOfSuperVectorSpaces}). We write $sCAlg_k$ for the [[category]] of [[supercommutative superalgebras]] with the induced [[homomorphisms]] between them:

$$
  sCAlg_k \;\coloneqq\; CMon(sVect_k)
  \,.
$$

Unwinding what this means, then a [[supercommutative superalgebra]] $A$ is

1. a $\mathbb{Z}/2$-graded associative algebra according to example \ref{GradedAlgebras};

1. such that for any two elements $a, b$ of homogeneous degree, their product satisfies

   $$
     a b \; = \; (-1)^{deg(a) deg(b)}\, b a
     \,.
   $$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

In view of def. \ref{SupercommutativeSuperalgebra} we might define a not-necessarily supercommutative superalgebra to be a [[monoid]] (not necessarily commutative) in [[sVect]], and write

$$
  sAlg_k \coloneqq Mon(sVect)
  \,.
$$

However, since the definition of not-necessarily commutative monoids (def. \ref{MonoidsInMonoidalCategory}) does not invoke the [[braiding]] of the ambient [[tensor category]], and since [[super vector spaces]] differ from $\mathbb{Z}/2$-[[graded vector spaces]] only via their [[braiding]] (example \ref{CategoryOfSuperVectorSpaces}), this yields equivalently just the $\mathbb{Z}/2$-graded algebras froom example \ref{GradedAlgebras}:

$$
  sAlg_k \simeq Alg_k^{\mathbb{Z}/2}
  \,.
$$

Hence the heart of [[superalgebra]] is _[[supercommutative superalgebra|super-commutativity]]_.

###### Example

The [[supercommutative superalgebra]] which is [[free construction|freely generated]] over $k$ from $n$ generators
$\{\theta_i\}_{i = 1}^n$ is the [[quotient]] of the [[tensor algebra]] $T^\bullet \mathbb{R}^n$,
with the generators $\theta_i$ in odd degree, by the ideal generated by the
relations

$$
  \theta_i \theta_j = - \theta_j \theta_i
$$

for all $i,j \in \{1, \cdots, n\}$.

This is also called a _[[Grassmann algebra]]_, in honor of ([Grassmann 1844](#Grassmann1844)), who introduced and
studied the super-sign rule in def. \ref{SupercommutativeSuperalgebra} a century ahead of his time.

We also denote this algebra by

$$

The following is an elementary but fundamental fact about the relation between
commutative algbra and supercommutative superalgebra. It is implicit in much of the

of [[commutative algebras]] (example \ref{MonoidsInVectAreAssociativeAlgebras})
into [[supercommutative superalgebras]] (def. \ref{SupercommutativeSuperalgebra})
induced via prop. \ref{MonoidsPreservedByLaxMonoidalFunctor} from the full inclusion

$$
  i \;\colon\; Vectk \hookrightarrow sVect_k
$$

of [[vector spaces]] (def. \ref{VectorSpaces}) into [[super vector spaces]]
(def. \ref{CategoryOfSuperVectorSpaces}), which is a [[braided monoidal functor]]
by prop. \ref{InclusionOfVectorSpacesIntoSupervectorSpaces}. Hence this regards a
commutative algebra as a superalgebra concentrated in even degree.

This inclusion functor has both a [[left adjoint|left]] [[adjoint functor]] and a [[right adjoint|right]] [[adjoint functor]] ,
(an [[adjoint triple]] exibiting a [[reflective subcategory]] and [[coreflective subcategory]] inclusion, an "[[adjoint cylinder]]"):

$$

Here

1. the [[right adjoint]] $(-)_{even}$ sends a supercommutative superalgebra to its even part $A \mapsto A_{even}$;

1. the [[left adjoint]] $(-)/(-)_{even}$ sends a supercommutative superalgebra to the [[quotient]] by the ideal which is generated by its odd part $A \mapsto A/(A_{odd})$ (hence it sets all elements to zero which may be written as a product such that at least one factor is odd-graded).

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The full inclusion $i$ is evident. To see the [[adjunctions]] observe their characteristic
[[natural bijections]] between [[hom-sets]]:
If $A_{ordinary}$ is an ordinary commutative algebra regarded as a superalgeba $i(A_{ordinary})$ concentrated in even degree,
and if $B$ is any superalgebra,

1. then every super-algebra homomorphism of the form $A_{ordinary} \to B$ must factor
   through $B_{even}$, simply because super-algebra homomorpism by definition respect the $\mathbb{Z}/2$-grading. This gives a natual bijection

   $$
     Hom_{sCAlg_k}(i(A_{ordinary}), B) \simeq Hom_{CAlg_k}(A_{ordinary,B_{even}})
     \,,
   $$

1. every super-algebra homomorphism of the form $B \to i(A_{ordinary})$ must send every odd element of $B$ to 0, again because homomorphism have to respect the $\mathbb{Z}/2$-grading, and since homomorphism of course also preserve products, this means that the entire ideal generated by $B_{odd}$ must be sent to zero, hence the homomorphism must facto through the [[projection]] $B \to B/B_{odd}$, which gives a natural bijection

   $$
     Hom_{sCalg_k}(B, i(A_{ordinary}))
       \simeq
     Hom_{Alg_k}(B/B_{odd}, A_{ordinary})
     \,.

###### Definition

For $\mathcal{C}$ a [[symmetric monoidal category]], then we write

$$

for the [[opposite category]] of the [[category of commutative monoids]] in $\mathcal{C}$, according to def. \ref{MonoidsInMonoidalCategory}.

For $R \in CMon(\mathcal{C})$ we write

$$
  Spec(A)
  \in
  Aff(\mathcal{C})
$$

for the same object, regarded in the opposite category. We also call this the **[[affine scheme]]** of $A$. Conversely, for $X \in Aff(\mathcal{C})$, we write

$$
  \mathcal{O}(X) \in CMon(\mathcal{C})
$$

for the same object, regarded in the category of commutative monoids. We also call this the **[[algebra of functions]]** on $X$.

+-- {: .num_defn #AffineSuperSchemes}
###### Definition

For the special case that $\mathal{C} = $ [[sVect]] (def. \ref{CategoryOfSuperVectorSpaces})
in def. \ref{Affines}, then we say that the objects in

$$
  Aff(sVect_k) = scAlg_k^{op} =  CMon(sVect_k)^{op}
$$

are **affine [[super schemes]]** over $k$.

=--

+-- {: .num_example #OrdinaryCAlgAssCAlg}
###### Example

For $A \in CAlg_{\mathbb{R}}$ an ordinary [[commutative algebra]] over $\mathbb{R}$,
then of course this becomes a [[supercommutative superalgebra]] by regarding it
as being concentrated in even degrees. Accordingly, via def. \ref{Affines}, ordinary [[affine schemes]]
[[full subcategory|fully embed]] into affine [[super schemes]] (def. \ref{AffineSuperSchemes})

$$
  Aff(Vect_k)
    \hookrightarrow
  Aff(sVect_k)
  \,.
$$

In particular for $\mathbb{R}^p$ an ordinary [[Cartesian space]], this becomes
an affine [[superscheme]] in even degree, under the above embedding. As such, it is usually
written

$$
  \mathbb{R}^{p \vert 0}
    \in
  Aff(sVect_k)
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .num_example #Superpoint}
###### Example

The formal dual space, according to def. \ref{Affines} (example \ref{Affines}) to a [[Grassmann algebra]] $\wedge^\bullet_{\mathbb{R}}(\mathbb{R}^q)$
(example \ref{GrassmannAlgebra}) is to be thought of as a space which is "so tiny" that
the coefficients of the [[Taylor expansion]] of any real-valued function on it
become "so very small" as to be actually equal to zero, at least after the $q$-th power.

For instance for $q = 2$ then a general element of $\wedge^\bullet_{\mathbb{R}}(\mathbb{R}^q)$
is of the form

$$
  f = a_0 + a_1 \theta_1 + a_2 \theta_2 + a_{12} \theta_1 \theta_2
  \;\;\;\in
  \wedge^\bullet_{\mathbb{R}}(\mathbb{R}^q)
  \,.
$$

for $a_1,a_2, a_{12} \in \mathbb{R}$,
to be compared with the [[Taylor expansion]] of a [[smooth function]] $g \colon \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$,
which is of the form

$$
  g(x_1, x_2) =
  g(0) + \frac{\partial g}{\partial x_1}(0)\, x_1 + \frac{\partial g}{\partial x_2}(0)\, x_2
    +
    \frac{\partial^2 g}{\partial x_1 \partial x_2}(0) \, x_1 x_2
     +
      \cdots
  \,.
$$

Therefore the [[formal dual]] [[space]] to a [[Grassmann algebra]] behaves like an infinitesimal neighbourhood of a point.
Hence these are also called **[[superpoints]]** and one writes

$$
  \mathbb{R}^{0\vert q}
    \coloneqq
  Spec(\wedge^\bullet_{\mathbb{R}}(\mathbb{R}^q))
  \,.
$$


=--

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

Combining example \ref{OrdinaryCAlgAssCAlg} with example \ref{Superpoint},
and using prop. \ref{ProductsInAff}, we obtain the affine [[super schemes]]

$$
  \mathbb{R}^{p \vert q}
    \coloneqq
  \mathbb{R}^{p\vert 0}
    \times
  \mathbb{R}^{0\vert q}
    \simeq
  Spec\left(
     \underbrace{C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^p)}
       \otimes_{\mathbb{R}}
     \wedge^\bullet_{\mathbb{R}} \mathbb{R}^q
  \right)
  \,.
$$

These may be called the **[[super Cartesian spaces]]**.

[[Cartesian spaces]] do for [[smooth manifolds]]. See at _[[geometry of physics -- supergeometry]]_ for more on this.

which on homogeneously graded elements $a$ of degree $deg(a) \in \{even,odd\} = \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ is multiplication by the degree

$$
  a \mapsto (-1)^{deg(a)}a
  \,.
$$

(e.g. [arXiv:1303.1916, 7.5](http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.1916))

Dually, via def. \ref{Affines}, this means that every affine [[super scheme]] has a canonical [[involution]].

=--



Here are more general and more abstract examples of commutative monoids, which will be useful to make explicit:

+-- {: .num_example #MonoidGivenByTensorUnit}
###### Example

Given a [[monoidal category]] $(\mathcal{C}, \otimes, 1)$ (def. \ref{MonoidalCategory}), then the [[tensor unit]] $1$ is a [[monoid in a monoidal category|monoid in]] $\mathcal{C}$ (def. \ref{MonoidsInMonoidalCategory}) with product given by either the left or right [[unitor]]

$$
  \ell_1 = r_1 \;\colon\; 1 \otimes 1 \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} 1

By lemma \ref{kel1}, these two morphisms coincide and define an [[associativity|associative]] product with unit the identity $id \colon 1 \to 1$.

If $(\mathcal{C}, \otimes , 1)$ is a [[symmetric monoidal category]] (def. \ref{SymmetricMonoidalCategory}), then this monoid is a [[commutative monoid in a symmetric monoidal category|commutative monoid]].

(where the first isomorphism is, $\ell_1^{-1} = r_1^{-1}$ (lemma \ref{kel1})) and with product morphism given by

$$

   \otimes
  E_1 \otimes E_2

  E_1 \otimes E_2
$$

(where we are notationally suppressing the [[associators]] and where $\tau$ denotes the [[braiding]] of $\mathcal{C}$).

That this definition indeed satisfies associativity and commutativity follows from the corresponding properties of $(E_i,\mu_i, e_i)$, and from the hexagon identities for the braiding (def. \ref{BraidedMonoidalCategory}) and from symmetry of the braiding.

Similarly one checks that for $E_1 = E_2 = E$ then the unit maps

$$
  E \simeq E \otimes 1

Let $(\mathcal{C},\otimes_{\mathcal{C}}, 1_{\mathcal{C}})$ and $(\mathcal{D}, \otimes_{\mathcal{D}},1_{\mathcal{D}})$ be two [[monoidal categories]] (def. \ref{MonoidalCategory}) and let $F \;\colon\; \mathcal{C} \longrightarrow \mathcal{D}$ be a [[lax monoidal functor]] (def. \ref{LaxMonoidalFunctor}) between them.

Then for $(A,\mu_A,e_A)$ a [[monoid in a monoidal category|monoid in]] $\mathcal{C}$ (def. \ref{MonoidsInMonoidalCategory}), its image $F(A) \in \mathcal{D}$ becomes a monoid $(F(A), \mu_{F(A)}, e_{F(A)})$ by setting

$$

from the [[category of monoids]] of $\mathcal{C}$ (def. \ref{MonoidsInMonoidalCategory}) to that of $\mathcal{D}$.

Moreover, if $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ are [[symmetric monoidal categories]] (def. \ref{SymmetricMonoidalCategory}) and $F$ is a [[braided monoidal functor]] (def. \ref{LaxMonoidalFunctor}) and $A$ is a [[commutative monoid]] (def. \ref{MonoidsInMonoidalCategory}) then so is $F(A)$, and this construction extends to a functor

### Modules in tensor categories and Super vector bundles
 {#ModulesInTensorCategories}

Above (in def. \ref{Affines}) we considered spaces $X$ from a dual perspective, as determined by their [[algebras of functions]] $\mathcal{O}(X)$. In the same spirit then we are to express various constructions on and with spaces in terms of dual algebraic constructions.

A key such construction is that of [[vector bundles]] over $X$. Here we discuss the corresponding algebraic incarnation of these, namely as _[[modules]]_ over [[algebras of functions]].

Suppose that $X$ is a [[smooth manifold]], and $V \stackrel{p}{\to} X$ is an ordinary smooth real [[vector bundle]] over $X$. A [[section]] of this vector bundle is a smooth function $\sigma \colon X \to V$ such that $p \circ \sigma = id$

$$
  \array{
     && V
    \\ & {}^{\mathllap{\sigma}}\nearrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    X &=& X
  }
  \,.
$$


Write $\Gamma_X(V)$ for the set of all such sections. Observe that this set inherits various extra [[stuff, structure, property|structure]].

First of all, since $V \to X$ is a vector bundle, we have [[fiber]]-wise the vector space operations. This means that
given two elements $c_1, c_2 \in \mathbb{R}$ in the [[real numbers]], and given two sections $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$, we may form in each [[fiber]] $V_x$ the [[linear combination]] $c_1 \sigma_1(x) + c_2 \sigma_2(x)$. This hence yields a new section $c_1 \sigma_1 + c_2 \sigma_2$. Hence the set of sections of a vector bundle naturally forms itself a vector space.

But there is more structure. We need not multiply with the same element $c \in \mathbb{R}$ in each fiber, but we may multiply the section in each fiber by a different element, as long as the choice of element varies smoothly with the fibers, so that the resulting section is still smooth.

In other words, every element $f \in C^\infty(X)$ in the $\mathbb{R}$-algebra of [[smooth functions]] on $X$, takes a smooth section $\sigma$ of $V$ to a new smooth section $f \cdot \sigma$. This operation enjoys some evident properties. It is [[bilinear map|bilinear]] in the real vector spaces $C^\infty(X)$ and $\Gamma_X(V)$, and it satisfies the "[[action|action property]]"

$$
  (f g) \cdot \sigma = f\cdot (g \cdot \sigma)
$$

for any two smooth functions $f,g \in C^\infty(X)$.

One says that a [[vector space]] such as $\Gamma_X(V)$ equipped with an [[action]] of an algebra $R$ this way is a _[[module]]_ over $R$.

In conclusion, any [[vector bundle]] $V \to X$ gives rise to an $C^\infty(X)$-[[module]] $\Gamma_X(V)$ of [[sections]].

The _[[smooth Serre-Swan theorem]]_ states sufficient conditions on $X$ such that the converse holds. Together with the [[embedding of smooth manifolds into formal duals of R-algebras]] (prop \ref{EmbeddingOfSmoothManifoldsIntoRAlgebras}), this means that [[differential geometry]] is "more algebraic" than it might superficially seem, hence that its "algebraic deformation" to [[supergeometry]] is
more natura than it might superficially seem:

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition
**([[smooth Serre-Swan theorem]], [Nestruev 03](smooth+Serre-Swan+theorem#Nestruev03))**

For $X$ a [[smooth manifold]], then the construction which sends a smooth [[vector bundle]] $V \to X$ to its $C^\infty(X)$-[[module]] $\Gamma_X(V)$ of [[sections]] is an [[equivalence of categories]]

$$
  VectBund_X^{fin}
    \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  C^\infty(X) Mod_{proj}^{fin\,gen}
$$

between that of smooth [[vector bundles]] of finite [[rank]] over $X$ and that of [[finitely generated object|finitely generated]] [[projective modules]] over the $\mathbb{R}$-[[associative algebra|algebra]] $C^\infty(X)$ of [[smooth functions]] on $X$.

=--

One may turn the [[Serre-Swan theorem]] around to regard for $R$ any [[commutative monoid]] in some [[symmetric monoidal category]] (def. \ref{MonoidsInMonoidalCategory}), the [[modules]] over $R$ as "generalized vector bundles" over the space $Spec(R)$ (def. \ref{Affines}). These "generalized vector bundles" are called "[[quasicoherent sheaves]]" over affines. Specified to the case that $\mathcal{C} = $ [[sVect]], this hence yields a concept of **super vector bundles**.

We now state the relevant definitions and constructions formally.

###### Proposition

In the situation of def. \ref{ModulesInMonoidalCategory}, the monoid $(A,\mu, e)$ canonically becomes a left module over itself by setting $\rho \coloneqq \mu$. More generally, for $C \in \mathcal{C}$ any object, then $A \otimes C$ naturally becomes a left $A$-module by setting:

$$
  \rho
  \;\colon\;
  A \otimes (A \otimes C)
   \underoverset{\simeq}{a^{-1}_{A,A,C}}{\longrightarrow}
  (A \otimes A) \otimes C
    \overset{\mu \otimes id}{\longrightarrow}
  A \otimes C
  \,.
$$

The $A$-modules of this form are called **[[free modules]]**.

The [[free functor]] $F$ constructing free $A$-modules is [[left adjoint]] to the [[forgetful functor]] $U$ which sends a module $(N,\rho)$ to the underlying object $U(N,\rho) \coloneqq N$.

$$
  A Mod(\mathcal{C})
    \underoverset
     {\underset{U}{\longrightarrow}}
     {\overset{F}{\longleftarrow}}
     {\bot}
  \mathcal{C}
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

A homomorphism out of a free $A$-module is a morphism in $\mathcal{C}$ of the form

$$
  f \;\colon\; A\otimes C \longrightarrow N
$$

fitting into the diagram (where we are notationally suppressing the [[associator]])

$$
  \array{
    A \otimes A \otimes C
      &\overset{A \otimes f}{\longrightarrow}&
    A \otimes N
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\mu \otimes id}}\downarrow
      &&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\rho}}
    \\
    A \otimes C
      &\underset{f}{\longrightarrow}&
    N
  }
  \,.
$$

Consider the composite

$$
  \tilde f
    \;\colon\;
  C
    \underoverset{\simeq}{\ell_C}{\longrightarrow}
  1 \otimes C
    \overset{e\otimes id}{\longrightarrow}
  A \otimes C
    \overset{f}{\longrightarrow}
  N
  \,,
$$

i.e. the restriction of $f$ to the unit "in" $A$. By definition, this fits into a [[commuting square]] of the form (where we are now notationally suppressing the [[associator]] and the [[unitor]])

$$
  \array{
   A \otimes C
     &\overset{id \otimes \tilde f}{\longrightarrow}&
   A \otimes N
   \\
   {}^{\mathllap{id \otimes e \otimes id}}\downarrow

   \downarrow^{\mathrlap{=}}
   \\
   A \otimes A \otimes C
    &\underset{id \otimes f}{\longrightarrow}&
   A \otimes N
  }
  \,.
$$

Pasting this square onto the top of the previous one yields

$$
  \array{
   A \otimes C
     &\overset{id \otimes \tilde f}{\longrightarrow}&
   A \otimes N
   \\
   {}^{\mathllap{id \otimes e \otimes id}}\downarrow

    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\rho}}
    \\
    A \otimes C
      &\underset{f}{\longrightarrow}&
    N
  }
  \,,
$$

where now the left vertical composite is the identity, by the unit law in $A$. This shows that $f$ is uniquely determined by $\tilde f$ via the relation

$$
  f = \rho \circ (id_A \otimes \tilde f)
  \,.
$$

This natural bijection between $f$ and $\tilde f$ establishes the adjunction.

###### Proposition

Given a [[closed monoidal category|closed]] [[symmetric monoidal category]] $(\mathcal{C}, \otimes, 1)$ (def. \ref{SymmetricMonoidalCategory}, def. \ref{ClosedMonoidalCategory}), and given $(A,\mu,e)$ a [[commutative monoid in a symmetric monoidal category|commutative monoid in]] $(\mathcal{C}, \otimes, 1)$ (def. \ref{MonoidsInMonoidalCategory}). If all [[coequalizers]] exist in $\mathcal{C}$, then the [[tensor product of modules]] $\otimes_A$ from def. \ref{TensorProductOfModulesOverCommutativeMonoidObject} makes the [[category of modules]] $A Mod(\mathcal{C})$ into a [[symmetric monoidal category]], $(A Mod, \otimes_A, A)$ with [[tensor unit]] the object $A$ itself, regarded as an $A$-module via prop. \ref{MonoidModuleOverItself}.

If moreover all [[equalizers]] exist, then this is a [[closed monoidal category]] (def. \ref{ClosedMonoidalCategory}) with [[internal hom]] given by the function modules $hom_A$ of def. \ref{TensorProductOfModulesOverCommutativeMonoidObject}.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof sketch

The associators and braiding for $\otimes_{A}$ are induced directly from those of $\otimes$ and the [[universal property]] of [[coequalizers]]. That $A$ is the tensor unit for $\otimes_{A}$ follows with the same kind of argument that we give in the proof of example \ref{FreeModulesTensorProduct} below.

=--

+-- {: .num_example #FreeModulesTensorProduct}
###### Example

For $(A,\mu,e)$ a [[monoid in a monoidal category|monoid]] (def. \ref{MonoidsInMonoidalCategory}) in a [[symmetric monoidal category]] $(\mathcal{C},\otimes, 1)$ (def. \ref{MonoidalCategory}), the [[tensor product of modules]] (def. \ref{TensorProductOfModulesOverCommutativeMonoidObject}) of two [[free modules]] (def. \ref{MonoidModuleOverItself}) $A\otimes C_1$ and $A \otimes C_2$ always exists and is the free module over the tensor product in $\mathcal{C}$ of the two generators:

$$
  (A \otimes C_1) \otimes_A (A \otimes C_2)
  \simeq
  A \otimes (C_1 \otimes C_2)
  \,.
$$

Hence if $\mathcal{C}$ has all [[coequalizers]], so that the [[category of modules]] is a [[monoidal category]] $(A Mod, \otimes_A, A)$ (prop. \ref{MonoidalCategoryOfModules}) then the free module functor (def. \ref{MonoidModuleOverItself}) is a [[strong monoidal functor]] (def. \ref{LaxMonoidalFunctor})

$$

    \longrightarrow
  (A Mod, \otimes_A, A)

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

It is sufficient to show that the diagram

$$
  A \otimes A \otimes A
   \underoverset
    {\underset{id \otimes \mu}{\longrightarrow}}
    {\overset{\mu \otimes id}{\longrightarrow}}
    {\phantom{AAAA}}
  A \otimes A
    \overset{\mu}{\longrightarrow}
  A
$$

is a [[coequalizer]] diagram (we are notationally suppressing the [[associators]]), hence that $A \otimes_A A \simeq A$, hence that the claim holds for $C_1 = 1$ and $C_2 = 1$.

To that end, we check the [[universal property]] of the [[coequalizer]]:

First observe that $\mu$ indeed coequalizes $id \otimes \mu$ with $\mu \otimes id$, since this is just the [[associativity]] clause in def. \ref{MonoidsInMonoidalCategory}. So for $f \colon A \otimes A \longrightarrow Q$ any other morphism with this property, we need to show that there is a unique morphism $\phi \colon A \longrightarrow Q$ which makes this [[commuting diagram|diagram commute]]:

$$
  \array{
    A \otimes A &\overset{\mu}{\longrightarrow}& A
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow & \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\phi}}
    \\
    Q
  }
  \,.
$$

We claim that

$$
  \phi
    \;\colon\;
  A
    \underoverset{\simeq}{r^{-1}}{\longrightarrow}
  A \otimes 1
    \overset{id \otimes e}{\longrightarrow}
  A \otimes A
    \overset{f}{\longrightarrow}
  Q
  \,,
$$

where the first morphism is the inverse of the right [[unitor]] of $\mathcal{C}$.

First to see that this does make the required triangle commute, consider the following pasting composite of [[commuting diagrams]]

$$
  \array{
    A \otimes A &\overset{\mu}{\longrightarrow}& A
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{id \otimes r^{-1}}}_{\mathllap{\simeq}}\downarrow
      &&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{r^{-1}}}_{\simeq}
    \\
    A \otimes A \otimes 1
      &\overset{\mu \otimes id}{\longrightarrow}&
    A \otimes 1
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{id \otimes e}}\downarrow
      &&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{id \otimes e} }
    \\
    A \otimes A \otimes A
      &\overset{\mu \otimes id}{\longrightarrow}&
    A \otimes A
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{id \otimes \mu}}\downarrow
      &&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    A \otimes A
      &\underset{f}{\longrightarrow}&
    Q
  }
  \,.
$$

Here the the top square is the [[natural transformation|naturality]] of the right [[unitor]], the middle square commutes by the functoriality of the tensor product $\otimes \;\colon\; \mathcal{C}\times \mathcal{C} \longrightarrow \mathcal{C}$ and the definition of the [[product category]] (def. \ref{OppositeAndProductOfPointedTopologicallyEnrichedCategory}), while the commutativity of the bottom square is the assumption that $f$ coequalizes $id \otimes \mu$ with $\mu \otimes id$.

Here the right vertical composite is $\phi$,  while, by [unitality](#UnitalityMonoid) of $(A,\mu ,e)$, the left vertical composite is the identity on $A$, Hence the diagram says that $\phi \circ \mu = f$, which we needed to show.

It remains to see that $\phi$ is the unique morphism with this property for given $f$. For that let $q \colon A \to Q$ be any other morphism with $ q\circ \mu = f$. Then consider the [[commuting diagram]]

$$
  \array{
    A \otimes 1 &\overset{\simeq}{\longleftarrow}& A
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{id\otimes e}}\downarrow & \searrow^{\simeq}
    & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{=}}
    \\
    A \otimes A &\overset{\mu}{\longrightarrow}& A
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow & \swarrow_{\mathrlap{q}}
    \\
    Q
  }
  \,,
$$

where the top left triangle is the [unitality](#UnitalityMonoid) condition and the two isomorphisms are the right [[unitor]] and its inverse. The commutativity of this diagram says that $q = \phi$.

=--

(e.g. [EKMM 97, VII lemma 1.3](#EKMM97))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

In one direction, consider a $A$-algebra $E$ with unit $e_E \;\colon\; A \longrightarrow E$ and product $\mu_{E/A} \colon E \otimes_A E \longrightarrow E$. There is the underlying product $\mu_E$

$$
  \array{
    E \otimes A \otimes E
    &
    \underoverset
      {\underset{}{\longrightarrow}}
      {\overset{}{\longrightarrow}}
      {\phantom{AAA}}
    &
    E \otimes E
     &\overset{coeq}{\longrightarrow}&
    E \otimes_A E
    \\
    && & {}_{\mathllap{\mu_E}}\searrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mu_{E/A}}}
    \\
    && && E
  }
  \,.
$$

By considering a diagram of such coequalizer diagrams with middle vertical morphism $e_E\circ e_A$, one find that this is a unit for $\mu_E$ and that $(E, \mu_E, e_E \circ e_A)$ is a commutative monoid in $(\mathcal{C}, \otimes, 1)$.

Then consider the two conditions on the unit $e_E \colon A \longrightarrow E$. First of all this is an $A$-module homomorphism, which means that

$$
  (\star)
  \;\;\;\;\;
  \;\;\;\;\;
  \array{
    A \otimes A &\overset{id \otimes e_E}{\longrightarrow}& A \otimes E
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\mu_A}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\rho}}
    \\
    A &\underset{e_E}{\longrightarrow}& E
  }
$$

[[commuting diagram|commutes]]. Moreover it satisfies the unit property

$$
  \array{
    A \otimes_A E
      &\overset{e_A \otimes id}{\longrightarrow}&
    E \otimes_A E
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{\simeq}}\searrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mu_{E/A}}}
    \\
    && E
  }
  \,.
$$

By forgetting the tensor product over $A$, the latter gives

$$
  \array{
    A \otimes E
      &\overset{e \otimes id}{\longrightarrow}&
    E \otimes E
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{}}
    \\
    A \otimes_A E
      &\overset{e_E \otimes id}{\longrightarrow}&
    E \otimes_A E
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\simeq}}\downarrow
      &&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mu_{E/A}}}
    \\
    E &=& E
  }
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
   \simeq
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \array{
    A \otimes E
      &\overset{e_E \otimes id}{\longrightarrow}&
    E \otimes E
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\rho}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mu_{E}}}
    \\
    E &\underset{id}{\longrightarrow}& E
  }
  \,,
$$

where the top vertical morphisms on the left the canonical coequalizers, which identifies the vertical composites on the right as shown. Hence this may be [[pasting|pasted]] to the square $(\star)$ above, to yield a [[commuting square]]

$$
  \array{
    A \otimes A
     &\overset{id\otimes e_E}{\longrightarrow}&
    A \otimes E
      &\overset{e_E \otimes id}{\longrightarrow}&
    E \otimes E
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\mu_A}}\downarrow
      &&
    {}^{\mathllap{\rho}}\downarrow
      &&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mu_{E}}}
    \\
    A &\underset{e_E}{\longrightarrow}& E &\underset{id}{\longrightarrow}& E
  }
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
   =
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \array{
    A \otimes A
     &\overset{e_E \otimes e_E}{\longrightarrow}&
    E \otimes E
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\mu_A}}\downarrow
      &&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mu_E}}
    \\
    A &\underset{e_E}{\longrightarrow}& E
  }
  \,.
$$

This shows that the unit $e_A$ is a homomorphism of monoids $(A,\mu_A, e_A) \longrightarrow (E, \mu_E, e_E\circ e_A)$.

Now for the converse direction, assume that $(A,\mu_A, e_A)$ and $(E, \mu_E, e'_E)$ are two commutative monoids in $(\mathcal{C}, \otimes, 1)$ with $e_E \;\colon\; A  \to E$ a monoid homomorphism. Then $E$ inherits a left $A$-[[module]] structure by

$$
  \rho
    \;\colon\;
  A \otimes E
    \overset{e_A \otimes id}{\longrightarrow}
  E \otimes E
    \overset{\mu_E}{\longrightarrow}
  E
  \,.
$$

By commutativity and associativity it follows that $\mu_E$ coequalizes the two induced morphisms $E \otimes A \otimes E \underoverset{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow}{\phantom{AA}} E \otimes E$. Hence the [[universal property]] of the [[coequalizer]] gives a factorization through some $\mu_{E/A}\colon E \otimes_A E \longrightarrow E$. This shows that $(E, \mu_{E/A}, e_E)$ is a commutative $A$-algebra.

Finally one checks that these two constructions are inverses to each other, up to isomorphism.

When thinking of commutative monoids in some tensor category as [[formal duals]] to certain [[spaces]],
as in def. \ref{Affines}, then we are interested in forming [[Cartesian products]] and more generally [[fiber products]] of these spaces. Dually this is given by [f[coproducts]] of commutative monoids and commutative $R$-algebras. The following says that these may be computed just as the [[tensor product of modules]]:

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[symmetric monoidal category]] such that

1. it has [[reflexive coequalizers]]

1. which are preserved by the [[tensor product]] functors $A \otimes (-) \colon \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}$ for all objects $A$ in $\mathcal{C}$.

Then for $f \colon A \to B$ and $g \colon A \to C$ two morphisms in the category $CMon(\mathcal{C})$ of _[[commutative monoids]]_ in $\mathcal{C}$ (def. \ref{MonoidsInMonoidalCategory}), the underlying object in $\mathcal{C}$ of the [[pushout]] in $CMon(\mathcal{C})$ coincides with the [[tensor product]] in the monoidal category $A$[[Mod]] (according to prop. \ref{MonoidalCategoryOfModules}):

$$
  U\left(B \sqcup_A C\right) \simeq  B \otimes_A C

###### Proof

By definition, every [[tensor category]] is an [[abelian category]] (def. \ref{AdditiveAndAbelianCategories}).
The [[coequalizer]] of two [[parallel morphisms]] $f,g$ in an abelian category is isomorphic to the [[cokernel]]
of the difference $f-g$ (formed in the [[abelian group]] struture on the [[hom-space]]). Hence all
coequalizers exist, in particlar the [[split coequalizers]] required in prop. \ref{CoproductsInCMon}.


Moreover, by definition every [[tensor category]] is a [[rigid monoidal category]]. This implies that it is
also a [[closed monoidal categories]], by prop. \ref{CompactClosedMonoidalCategory}, and this means that the
functors $A \otimes (-)$ are [[left adjoint]] functors, and such preserve all colimits.

Then for $A_1, A_2$ two

the [[Cartesian product]] of $Spec(A_1)$ with $Spec(A_2)$ exists in $Aff(R Mod(\mathcal{C}))$

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[symmetric monoidal category]], let $A_1, A_2 \in CMon(\mathcal{C})$ be two [[commutative monoids]] in $\mathcal{C}$ (def. \ref{MonoidsInMonoidalCategory}) and

$$
  \phi \;\colon\; A_1 \longrightarrow A_2

a [[homomorphism]] [[commutative monoids]] (def. \ref{MonoidsInMonoidalCategory}).

where

1. the [[right adjoint]], called **[[restriction of scalars]]**, sends an $A_2$-[[module]] $(N, \rho)$ to the $A_1$-module $(N,\rho')$ whose [[action]] is given by precomposition with $\phi$:

   $$
     A_1 \otimes N

In the dual interpretation of $R$-[[modules]] as generalized [[vector bundles]] (namely: [[quasicoherent sheaves]]) over $Spec(R)$ (def. \ref{Affines}) then $\phi \colon A_1 \to A_2$ becomes a map of spaces

$$
  Spec(\phi)
   \colon
  Spec(A_2)
    \longrightarrow
  Spec(A_1)

and then [[extension of scalars]] according to prop. \ref{ExtensionOfScalars} corresponds to the [[pullback]] of vector bundles from $Spec(A_1)$ to $Spec(A_2)$.

### Super-Groups as super-commutative Hopf algebras
 {#GroupsAsHopfAlgebras}

Above we have considered affine spaces $Spec(A)$ (def. \ref{Affines}) in [[symmetric monoidal categories]] $\mathcal{C}$.
Now we discuss what it means to equip these with the stucture of [[group objects]], hence to form
affine groups in $\mathcal{C}$.

A (possibly) familiar example arises in [[differential geometry]], where one considers groups whose underlying set is promoted to a [[smooth manifold]] and all whose operations (product, inverses) are [[smooth functions]]. These are of course the _[[Lie groups]]_.

A **[[linear representation]]** of a [[Lie group]] $G$ on a [[vector space]] $V$ is a [[smooth function]]

$$
  \rho \;\colon\; G \times V \longrightarrow V
$$

such that

1. ([[linear map|linearity]]) for all elements $g \in G$ the function

   $$
     \rho(g) \colon V \longrightarrow V
   $$

   is a [[linear function]]

1. ([[unitality]]) for $e \in G$ the [[neutral element]] then $\rho(e)$ is the [[identity]] function;

1. ([[action]] property) for $g_1, g_2 \in G$ any two elements, then acting with them consecutively is the same as acting with their product:

   $$
      \rho(g_2) \circ  \rho(g_1) = \rho(g_2 g_1)
      \,.
   $$

But here we need to consider groups with more general geometric structure. The key to the generalization is to regard [[spaces]] dually via their [[algebras of functions]].


In the above example, write $C^\infty(X)$ for the [[smooth algebra]] of [[smooth functions]] on a [[smooth manifold]] $X$. The assignment

$$
  C^\infty(-) \;\colon\; SmthMfd \hookrightarrow SmthAlg_{\mathbb{R}}^{op}
$$

is the [[embedding of smooth manifolds into formal duals of R-algebras]] from prop. \ref{EmbeddingOfSmoothManifoldsIntoRAlgebras}.

Moreover, the functor $C^\infty(-)$ sends [[Cartesian products]] of smooth manifolds to "completed tensor products" $\otimes^c$ of function algebras (namely to the [[coproduct]] of [[smooth algebras]], see there)

$$
  C^\infty(X \times Y) \simeq C^\infty(X) \otimes^c C^\infty(Y)
  \,.
$$

Together this means that if $X = G$ is equipped with the structure of a [[group object]], then the product operation in the group induces a "[[coproduct]]" operation on its smooth algebra of smooth functions:

$$
  \array{
    product &\colon& G \times G &\longrightarrow& G
    \\
    && C^\infty(G) \otimes^c C^\infty(G) &\longleftarrow& C^\infty(G) &\colon& product^\ast = coproduct
  }
  \,.
$$

Now the [[associativity]] of the group product translates into a corresponding dual property of its dual, called "[[co-associativity]]", and so forth. The resulting algebraic structure is called a **[[Hopf algebra]]**.


While the explicit definition of a _[[Hopf algebra]]_ may look involved at first sight, Hopf algebras are simply [[formal duals]] of [[groups]]. Since this perspective is straightforward, we may just as well consider it in the generality of [[groupoids]].

A simple illustrative archetype of the following construction of commutative Hopf algebroids from homotopy commutative ring spectra is the following situation:

For $X$ a [[finite set]] consider

$$
  \array{
    X \times X \times X
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\circ = (pr_1, pr_3)}}
    \\
    X \times X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{s = pr_1}}\downarrow
     \uparrow
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{t = pr_2}}
    \\
    X
  }
$$

as the ("[[codiscrete groupoid|codiscrete]]") [[groupoid]] with $X$ as [[objects]] and precisely one morphism from every object to every other. Hence the [[composition]] operation $\circ$, and the [[source]] and [[target]] maps are simply projections as shown. The identity morphism (going upwards in the above diagram) is the [[diagonal]].

Then consider the image of this structure under forming the [[free abelian groups]] $\mathbb{Z}[X]$, regarded as [[commutative rings]] under pointwise multiplication.

Since

$$
  \mathbb{Z}[X \times X]
    \simeq
  \mathbb{Z}[X] \otimes \mathbb{Z}[X]
$$

this yields a diagram of homomorphisms of commutative rings of the form

$$
  \array{
    (\mathbb{Z}[X] \otimes \mathbb{Z}[X] )
      \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}[X]}
    (\mathbb{Z}[X] \otimes \mathbb{Z}[X])
    \\
    \uparrow^{\mathrlap{} }
    \\
    \mathbb{Z}[X] \otimes \mathbb{Z}[X]
    \\
    \uparrow
     \downarrow
    \uparrow
    \\
    \mathbb{Z}[X]
  }
$$

satisfying some obvious conditions. Observe that here

1. the two morphisms $\mathbb{Z}[X] \rightrightarrows \mathbb{Z}[X] \otimes \mathbb{Z}[X]$ are $f \mapsto f \otimes e$ and $f \mapsto e \otimes f$, respectively, where $e$ denotes the unit element in $\mathbb{Z}[X]$;

1. the morphism $\mathbb{Z}[X] \otimes \mathbb{Z}[X] \to \mathbb{Z}[X]$ is the multiplication in the ring $\mathbb{Z}[X]$;

1. the morphism

   $$
     \mathbb{Z}[X] \otimes \mathbb{Z}[X]
       \longrightarrow
     \mathbb{Z}[X] \otimes \mathbb{Z}[C] \otimes \mathbb{Z}[C]
       \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
     (\mathbb{Z}[X] \otimes \mathbb{Z}[X] ) \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}[X]} (\mathbb{Z}[X] \otimes \mathbb{Z}[X])
   $$

   is given by $f \otimes g \mapsto f \otimes e \otimes g$.

We now say this again, in generality:

+-- {: .num_prop #CommutativeHopfAlgebroidSpelledOut}
###### Proposition


An [[internal category]] in $CMon(\mathcal{A})^{op}$ is a [[diagram]] in $CMon(\mathcal{A})^{op}$ of the form

$$
  \array{
    Spec(\Gamma) \underset{Spec(A)}{\times} Spec(\Gamma)

    \\
    Spec(A)

$$

(where the [[fiber product]] at the top is over $s$ on the left and $t$ on the right) such that the pairing $\circ$ defines an [[associativity law|associative]] [[composition]] over $Spec(A)$, [[unitality|unital]] with respect to $i$. This is an [[internal groupoid]] if it is furthemore equipped with a morphism

$$
  inv \;\colon\; Spec(\Gamma) \longrightarrow Spec(\Gamma)
$$

acting as assigning [[inverses]] with respect to $\circ$.

The key fact to use now is prop. \ref{ProductsInAff}: the [[tensor product]] of commutative monoids exhibits the [[cartesian monoidal category]] structure on $CMon(\mathcal{A})^{op}$, :
$$
  Spec(R_1) \underset{Spec(R_3)}{\times} Spec(R_2)
  \simeq
  Spec(R_1 \otimes_{R_3} R_2)

###### Remark

Generally, in a commutative Hopf algebroid, def. \ref{CommutativeHopfAlgebroid}, the two morphisms $\eta_L, \eta_R\colon A \to \Gamma$ from remark \ref{CommutativeHopfAlgebroidSpelledOut} need not coincide, they make $\Gamma$ genuinely into a [[bimodule]] over $A$, and it is the [[tensor product]] of [[bimodules]] that appears in remark \ref{CommutativeHopfAlgebroidSpelledOut}. But it may happen that they coincide:

An [[internal groupoid]] $\mathcal{G}_1 \stackrel{\overset{s}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{t}{\longrightarrow}} \mathcal{G}_0$ for which the [[domain]] and [[codomain]] morphisms coincide, $s = t$, is euqivalently a [[group object]] in the [[slice category]] over $\mathcal{G}_0$.

Dually, a [[commutative Hopf algebroid]] $\Gamma \stackrel{\overset{\eta_L}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{\eta_R}{\longleftarrow}} A$ for which $\eta_L$ and $\eta_R$ happen to coincide is equivalently a **commutative [[Hopf algebra]]** $\Gamma$ over $A$.

### Super Fiber functors and their automorphism supergroups
 {#FiberFunctors}

The first step in exhibiting a given [[tensor category]] $\mathcal{A}$ as being a [[category of representations]] is to exhibit its objects as having an [[forgetful functor|underlying]] representation space of sorts, and then an [[action]] represented on that space. Hence a necessary condition on $\mathcal{A}$ is that there exists a [[forgetful functor]]

$$
   \omega \;\colon\; \mathcal{A} \longrightarrow \mathcal{V}
$$

to some other [[tensor category]], such that $\omega$ satisfies a list of properties, in particular it should be a [[symmetric monoidal functor|symmetric]] [[strong monoidal functor]].

Such functors are called _[[fiber functors]]_. The idea is that we think of $\mathcal{A}$ as a [[bundle]] over $\mathcal{V}$, and over each $V \in \mathcal{V}$ we find the [[fiber]] $\omega^{-1}(V)$ of that "bundle", consisting of all those objects in $\mathcal{A}$ whose underlying object in the given $V$.

The main point of [[Tannaka duality]] of tensor categories is the observation that if $\mathcal{A}$ is a [[category of representations]] of some [[group]] $G$, then $G$ also [[action|acts]] by [[automorphisms]] on that [[fiber functor]] (i.e. via [[natural isomorphisms]] of functors). In good cases then this may be turned around, and the full [[automorphism group]] of a fiber functor is identified with the group $G$ for which the objects in its fibers are [[representations]], this is the process of [[Tannaka reconstruction]].

There are slight variants on what one requires of a fiber functor. For the present purpose we fix the following definition

+-- {: .num_defn #FiberFunctor}
###### Definition

Let $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{T}$ be two $k$-[[tensor categories]] (def. \ref{TensorCategory}) such that

1. all [[object of finite length|objects have finite length]];

1. all [[hom spaces]] are of [[finite number|finite]] [[dimension]] over $k$.

Let $R \in CMon(Ind(\mathcal{T}))$ be a [[commutative monoid in a symmetric monoidal category|commutative monoid]] (def. \ref{MonoidsInMonoidalCategory}) in the category of [[ind-objects]] in $\mathcal{T}$ (prop. \ref{IndObjectsInATensorCategory}).

Then a **[[fiber functor]] on $\mathcal{A}$ over $R$** is a [[functor]]

$$
  \omega \;\colon\; \mathcal{A} \longrightarrow R Mod(Ind(\mathcal{T}))
$$

from $\mathcal{A}$ to the [[category of modules|category of]] [[module objects]] over $R$ (def. \ref{ModulesInMonoidalCategory}) in the [[category of ind-objects]] $Ind(\mathcal{T})$ (def. \ref{IndObjectsInATensorCategory}), which is

1. a [[braided monoidal functor|braided]] [[strong monoidal functor]];

1. an [[exact functor]] in both variables.

If here $\mathcal{T} = $ [[sVect]] (def. \ref{CategoryOfSuperVectorSpaces}), then this is called a **super fiber functor**.

=--

([Deligne 02, 3.1](#Deligne02))


+-- {: .num_defn #TannakianCategory}
###### Definition

A [[tensor category]] $\mathcal{A}$ (def. \ref{TensorCategory}) is called

1. a **neutral [[Tannakian category]]** if it admits a fiber functor (def. \ref{FiberFunctor}) to $Vect_k$ (example \ref{VectAsAMonoidalCategory}) ([Deligne-Milne 12, def. 2.19](#DeligneMilne12))

1. a **neutral super [[Tannakian category]]** if it admits a fiber functor (def. \ref{FiberFunctor}) to $sVect_k$ (def. \ref{CategoryOfSuperVectorSpaces})

1. (not needed here) a general **[[Tannakian category]]** if the [[stack]] on $Aff_k$ which sends $R \in CRing$ to the groupoid
   of fiber functors to $R Proj \hookrightarrow R Mod$ ([[projective modules]] over $R$) is an affine [[gerbe]]
   such that its category of representations is equivalent to $\mathcal{A}$ ([Deligne-Milne 12, def. 3.7](#DeligneMilne12)).

=--




Given a super fiber functor $\omega \colon \mathcal{A} \to sVect_k$ (def. \ref{FiberFunctor}) there is an evident notion of its [[automorphism group]]: a [[homomorphism]] between [[functors]] is a [[natural transformation]], and that between [[monoidal functors]] is a [[monoidal natural transformation]], according to def. \ref{LaxMonoidalFunctor}, and this is an [[automorphism]] of functors if it is a [[natural automorphism]]. We write

$$
  Aut(\omega) \in Grp
$$

for this automorphism group.

So far this is a group without geometric structure (a [[discrete group]]). But it is naturally equipped with [[supergeometry]] (super-[[algebraic geometry]]) exhibited by a rule for what the "geometrically parameterized families" of its elements are. (For exposition of this perspective see at _[[motivation for sheaves, cohomology and higher stacks]]_).

Concretely, this means that for each [[supercommutative superalgebra]] $A$ with corresponding affine [[super scheme]] $Spec(A)$ (def. \ref{Affines}, def. \ref{SupercommutativeSuperalgebra}) we are to say what the set

$$
  \underline{Aut}(\omega)(Spec(A))
   \in
  Set
$$

of $Spec(A)$-parameterized elements of $Aut(\omega)$ is. In fact, under parameter-wise multiplication in the group, any such set must inherit group structure, so that we should have not one discrete group, but a system of them, labeled by supercommutative superalgebras:

$$
  \underline{Aut}(\omega)(Spec(A))
   \in
  Grp
  \,.
$$

Moreover, if $A_1 \longrightarrow A_2$ is an algebra homomorphism, hence

$$
  Spec(A_2) \longrightarrow Spec(A_1)
$$

a map of affine super schemes according to def. \ref{SupercommutativeSuperalgebra}, then there should be a group homomorphism

$$
  \underline{Aut}(\omega)(Spec(A_2))
    \longleftarrow
  \underline{Aut}(\omega)(Spec(A_1))
$$

that expresses how a $Spec(A_1)$-parameterized family of elements of $Aut(\omega)$ becomes a $Spec(A_1)$-parameterized family, under this map.

For a minimum of consistency, this assignment must be such that the identity map on $Spec(A)$ induces the identity on $\underline{Aut}(\omega)(Spec(A))$, and that the composite of two maps of affine superschemes goes to the correspondng composite group homomorphisms.

In conclusion, this says that an algebraic supergeometric structure on $Aut(\omega)$ is the datum of a [[presheaf]] of groups, hence of a [[functor]]

$$
  \underline{Aut}(\omega)
   \;\colon\;
  Aff(sVect)^{op} \simeq CMon(sVect)
   \longrightarrow
  Grp
$$

such that the underlying points are those of $Aut(\omega)$:

### Super-exterior powers and Schur functors

A [[finite dimensional vector space]] $V$ has the property that a high enough [[alternating power]] of it vanishes $\wedge^n V = 0$, namely this is the case for all $n \gt dim(V)$, and hence this vanishing is just another reflection of the finiteness of the [[dimension]] of $V$. For a [[super vector space]] $V$ of degreewise finite dimension an analog statement is still true, but one needs to form not just alternating powers but also [[symmetric powers]] (prop. \ref{SchurFunctorAnnihilatingFiniteDimensionalSuperVectorSpace} below), in fact one needs to apply a generalization of both of these constructions, a _[[Schur functor]]_.


The operation of forming [[symmetric powers]] and [[alternating powers]] makes sense in every [[tensor category]]. Moreover, these operations are the two extreme cases of the more general concept of [[Schur functors]]: Given any [[object]] $X$ and given any choice of [[irreducible representation]] $V_\lambda$ of the [[symmetric group]] $\Sigma_n$, then one consider the [[subobject]] $S_\lambda(X^{\otimes^n})$ of the $n$-fold [[tensor power]] that is [[invariant]] under this action.

The first step in the proof of the main theorem (theorem \ref{TheTheorem} below) is the proposition (prop. \ref{LengthOfObjectIsBounded} below) that all objects that have subexponential growth of length (def. \ref{SubexponentialGrowth}) are actually annihilated by some [[Schur functor]] for the [[symmetric group]].

* $V_\lambda$ is the [[irreducible representation]] of $S_n$ corresponding to $\lambda$;

* $\rho$ is [[diagonal action]] of $S_n$ on $V_\lambda \otimes X^{\otimes_n}$, coming from the canonical [[permutation]] action on $X^{\otimes_n}$;

* $(-)^{S_n}$ denotes the subspace of [[invariants]] under the action $\rho$

## Proof

We outline key steps of the proof of theorem \ref{TheTheorem}, given in [Deligne 02](#Deligne02).


Throughout, let $k$ be an [[algebraically closed field]] of [[characteristic zero]] (for instance the [[complex numbers]]).


The proof proceeds in three main steps:

1. **Proposition \ref{LengthOfObjectIsBounded}** states that in a $k$-[[tensor category]] an object $X$ is of subexponential growth (def. \ref{SubexponentialGrowth}) precisely if there exists a [[Schur functor]] that annihilates it, hence if some power of $X$, skew-symmetrized in sme variables and symmetrized in others, vanishes.

   This proposition is where the [[symmetric group]] and its [[permutation]] [[action]] on [[tensor powers]] appears, from just a kind of finite-dimensionality assumption.

1. **Proposition \ref{SchurFinitenessImpliesExistenceOfSuperFiberFunctor}** in turn says that if every object in $\mathcal{A}$ is annihilated by some [[Schur functor]], then there exists a super [[fiber functor]] on $\mathcal{A}$ over some [[supercommutative superalgebra]] $R$, hence then every object of $\mathcal{A}$ has underlying it a [[super vector space]] with some extra structure.

   This proposition is where [[superalgebra]] proper appears.

1. **Proposition \ref{DeligneTannakaReconstruction}** states that every $k$-[[tensor category]] equipped with a super fiber functor $\omega \colon \mathcal{A} \to sVect$, is equivalent to the category of super-representations of the automorphism supergroup of $\omega$.

   This proposition is the instance of general [[Tannaka reconstruction]] applied to the case of fiber functors with values in super vector spaces. This is where the "supersymmetry" supergroup is extracted.

###### Proposition

For $\mathcal{A}$ a $k$-[[tensor category]] (def. \ref{TensorCategory}), then the following are equivalent:

1. the category $\mathcal{A}$ has subexponential growth (def. \ref{SubexponentialGrowth});

1. for every object $X \in \mathcal{A}$ there exists $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and a [[partition]] $\lambda$ of $n$ such that the corresponding value of the [[Schur functor]], def. \ref{SchurFunctor}, on $X$ vanishes: $S_\lambda(X) = 0$.

###### Proposition

If for every object of a $k$-[[tensor category]] $\mathcal{A}$ (def. \ref{TensorCategory}) there exists a [[Schur functor]] (def. \ref{SchurFunctor}) that annihilates it, then there exists a [[fiber functor|super fiber functor]] (def. \ref{FiberFunctor}) over $k$,
hence then $\mathcal{A}$ is a neutral super [[Tannakian category]] (def. \ref{TannakianCategory}).

    \longrightarrow

$$

([Deligne 02, prop. 2.1 "résultat clé de l'article", together with prop. 4.5](#Deligne02))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof idea

First ([Deligne 02, middle of p. 16](#Deligne02)) consider the [[tensor category]]

$$
  s \mathcal{A}
    \coloneqq
  (\mathcal{A}^{\mathbb{Z}/2}, \tau_{super} )
$$

which is that of $\mathbb{Z}/2$-graded objects of $\mathcal{A}$, and whose [[braiding]] is given on objects $X,Y$ of homogeneous degree by that of $\mathcal{A}$ multiplied with $(-1)^{deg(X) deg(Y)}$.

Write $1$ and $\overline{1}$ for the [[tensor unit]] of $\mathcal{A}$, regarded in even degree and in odd degree in $s \mathcal{A}$, respectively.

For $A \in CMon(\mathcal{A})$ a [[commutative monoid]], write

$$
  \mathcal{A}
  \simeq
  1 Mod(\mathcal{A})
     \underoverset{\underset{U}{\longleftarrow}}{\overset{(-)_A \coloneqq F}{\longrightarrow}}
 {}
  A Mod(\mathcal{A})
$$

for the [[extension of scalars]] operation $A \otimes(-)$, [[left adjoint]] to [[restriction of scalars]] (prop. \ref{ExtensionOfScalars}).

Show then that the condition that an object $X$ is annihilated by some [[Schur functor]] is equivalent to the existence of an algebra $A$ such that

$$
  X_A \simeq 1^p \oplus \overline{1}^q
$$

for some $p,q \in \mathbb{N}$, hence that each such object is _$A$-locally_ a [[super vector space]].

([Deligne 02, prop. 2.9](#Deligne02)).

Moreover, for each [[short exact sequence]]

$$
  0 \to X \to Y \to Z \to 0
$$

in $s \mathcal{A}$, there exists an algebra $A$ such that

$$
  0 \to X_A \to Y_A \to Z_A \to 0
$$

is a [[split exact sequence]], (hence every short exact sequence is _locally_ split).

([Deligne 90, 7.14](#Deligne90), [Deligne 02, rappel 2.10](#Deligne 02))

Now ([Deligne 02, middle of p. 17](Deligne02)) let $A$ be the commutative monoid which is the [[tensor product]] of commutative monoids (example \ref{TensorProductOfTwoCommutativeMonoids}) over all [[isomorphism classes]] of [[objects]] and of [[short exact sequences]] in $\mathcal{A}$ of choices of commutative monoids for which these objects/exact sequencs are locally split, as above.

Then for an $A$-module $N$, write $\rho(N)$ for the [[subobject]] of $N$ inside $sVect \simeq Ind\langle 1, \overline{1}\rangle \hookrightarrow s \mathcal{A}$.

Check ([Deligne 02, bottom of p. 17](Deligne02)) that $\rho(A)$ inherits the structure of a commutative monoid, and that $\rho(N)$ inherits the structure of a module over $\rho(N)$.

Set

$$
  R \coloneqq \rho(A)
  \,.
$$

Hence for every object $X$, then

$$
  \omega(X)
    \coloneqq
  \rho(X_A)
$$

has the structure of an $R$-module. By $A$-local splitness of all short exact sequence, $\omega$ is an [[exact functor]].

Hence

$$
  \omega \;\colon\; s \mathcal{A} \longrightarrow R Mod(sVect)
$$

is a super fiber functor on $s\mathcal{A}$ over $R$. This restricts to a super fiber functor over $R$ on  $\mathcal{A}$, regarded as the sub-category of even-graded objects in $s \mathcal{A}$:

$$
  \mathcal{A}
    \hookrightarrow
  s \mathcal{A}
   \overset{\omega}{\longrightarrow}
  R Mod(sVect)
  \,,
$$

Finally check ([Deligne 02, prop. 4.5](#Deligne02)) that
if a $k$-[[tensor category]] $\mathcal{A}$ (def. \ref{TensorCategory}) admits a [[fiber functor|super fiber functor]] (def. \ref{FiberFunctor}) over a [[supercommutative superalgebra]] $R$ over $k$

$$
  \mathcal{A}
    \longrightarrow
  R Mod(sVect)
$$

then it also admits a super fiber functor over $k$ itself, i.e. a fiber functor to [[sVect]]

$$
  \mathcal{A}
    \longrightarrow
  k Mod(sVect)
  \simeq
  sVect
  \,.
$$

This is argued by expressing $R$ as an [[inductive limit]]

$$
  R = \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_\beta R_\beta
$$

over [[supercommutative superalgebras]] $R_\beta$ of finite type over $k$ and observing (...) that there exists $\beta$ such that $\omega_\beta$ is still a fiber functor and such that there exists an algebra homomorphism $R_\beta \to k$.

Finally then the fiber functor in question is

$$
  \omega_\beta \otimes_{R_\beta} k
   \;\colon\;
  \mathcal{A}
    \longrightarrow
  sVect_k
  \,.
$$

For every $k$-[[tensor category]] $\mathcal{A}$ (def. \ref{TensorCategory}) and a [[fiber functor|super fiber functor]] over $k$ (def. \ref{FiberFunctor})

$$
  \omega
    \;\colon\;
   \mathcal{A}

then $\omega$ induces an [[equivalence of categories]]

$$

(according to example \ref{FundamentalGroupOfCategoryOfSuperVectorSpaces}) under the group homomorphism

$$
  \pi(sVect) \longrightarrow \omega(\pi(\mathcal{A}))
  \simeq \underline{Aut}(\omega)
$$

from prop. \ref{HomomorphismFromPiT2ToEtaPiT1} and using the isomorphism from prop. \ref{AutOfFibFuncIsImagUnderFibFuncOfFundamentalGroup}.
