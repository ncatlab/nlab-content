# Duploid

## Idea

A **duploid** is a [[category]]-like structure where objects have a specific [[polarity in type theory|polarity]] and composition is not necessarily [[associative]].

Duploids are models of programming languages with explicitly polarized [[positive type|positive]] and [[negative type|negative]] types, accomodating both [[call-by-value]] and [[call-by-name]] programming paradigms.

A duploid can be constructed from an [[adjunction]] and the category of duploids is [[reflective subcategory|reflective]] in the category of adjunctions, equivalent to the subcategory of adjunctions satisfying an equalizing requirement.
