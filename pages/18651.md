## Idea

A **duploid** is a [[category]]-like [[structure]] where [[objects]] have a specific [[polarity in type theory|polarity]] and [[composition]] is not necessarily [[associative]].

Duploids are models of [[programming languages]] with explicitly polarized [[positive type|positive]] and [[negative type|negative]] [[types]], accomodating both [[call-by-value]] and [[call-by-name]] programming paradigms.

A duploid can be constructed from an [[adjunction]] and the category of duploids is [[reflective subcategory|reflective]] in the category of adjunctions, equivalent to the [[subcategory]] of adjunctions satisfying an equalizing requirement.

## Definition

A **pre-duploid** $\mathcal{D}$ consists of

1. a set $|\mathcal{D}|$ of objects with a polarity map $\varpi : |\mathcal{D}| \to \{+,-\}$. If $\varpi(A) = +$, we say $A$ is positive and otherwise negative.
2. for every pair $A,B \in |\mathcal{D}|$ a set of morphisms $\mathcal{D}(A,B)$.
3. for every compatible pair of morphisms $f \in \mathcal{D}(A,B), g\in \mathcal{D}(B,C)$ a composite $g \odot f \in \mathcal{D}(A,C)$.
4. for every object $A$ an morphism $id_A \in \mathcal{D}(A,A)$ that is the identity with respect to composition.
5. For every $f \in \mathcal{D}(A,B), g \in \mathcal{D}(B,C), h \in \mathcal{D}(C,D)$, an associative law $h \odot (g \odot f) = (h \odot g) \odot f$ when $B$ is negative or $C$ is positive.

Note that when restricted to positive objects or negative objects, composition and identities form a category, written $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{N}$. When the polarity is known we write positive objects as $L,M,N$ and negative objects as $P,Q,R$. We call composition where the middle object is positive "positive composition" or "by-value composition" and notate it as $g \bullet f$ and when the middle object is negative we call it "negative composition" or "by-name composition" and notate it as $g \circ f$.
Then the associativity laws can be restated as:

1. $\bullet\bullet$: $f \bullet (g \bullet h)  = (f \bullet g) \bullet h$
2. $\circ\circ$: $f \circ (g \circ h)  = (f \circ g) \circ h$
3. $\bullet\circ$: $f \bullet (g \circ h)  = (f \bullet g) \circ h$

and we can see that the only obstacle to associativity is that $f \circ (g \bullet h)$ is not necessarily equal to $(f \circ g) \bullet h$.

A **duploid** is a pre-duploid $\mathcal{D}$ plus two **polarity shifts** 
$\Downarrow : |\mathcal{N}| \to |\mathcal{P}| and \Uparrow : |\mathcal{P}| \to |\mathcal{N}|$, and for each $P \in |\mathcal{P}|, N \in |\mathcal{N}|$, morphisms:

1. $delay_P : P \to \Uparrow P$
2. $force_P : \Uparrow P \to P$
3. $wrap_N : N \to \Downarrow N$
4. $unwrap_N : \Downarrow N \to N$

such that

1. $\forall f : A \to P, force_P \circ (delay_P \bullet f) = f$
2. $\forall f : N \to A, (f \circ unwrap_N) \bullet wrap_N = f$
3. $delay_P \bullet force_P = id_{\Uparrow P}$
4. $wrap_N \circ unwrap_N = id_{\Downarrow N}$

In light of the definition of linear and thunkable morphisms, these identities are equivalent to saying

1. $wrap_N$ is thunkable.
2. $wrap_N, unwrap_N$ is an isomorphism.
3. $force_P$ is linear.
4. $force_P, thunk_P$ is an isomorphism.

## Linear and Thunkable Morphisms

Just as thunkable morphisms can be defined in a [[thunk-force category]] and linear morphisms can be defined in a category with a [[runnable monad]], they can be defined in a duploid in  a similar way using the thunk and run morphisms.
However, thunkable and linear morphisms can also be defined in a _pre-duploid_, giving a simple characterization just in terms of associativity of composition.

A morphism $f$ is **thunkable** if for all compatible $g,h$,
$$h \odot (g \odot f) = (h \odot g) \odot f.$$
and a morphism $f$ is **linear** if for all compatible $g,h$,
$$f \odot (g \odot h) = (f \odot g) \odot h.$$

Observe that all $f : P \to B$ are trivially linear and $g : A \to N$ are trivially thunkable. Further thunkable and linear morphisms form (non-full) subcategories $\mathcal{D}_t, \mathcal{D}_l$.

To understand these concepts, consider the non-trivial situation where $f : A \to P$ is thunkable:
$$h \circ (g \bullet f) = (h \circ g) \bullet f.$$
on the left side, since we have a by-name composition, $h$ is "evaluated first", whereas on the right side we have a by-value composition, so $f$ is evaluated first.
Thus these two morphisms being equal implies in many semantics $f$ cannot perform any [[side-effect]]. For instance if $f$ prints to the screen and so does $h$, then each composite will print in a different order. Furthermore, if $f$ can manipulate its [[continuation]] explicitly, it has to treat it linearly otherwise $h$ may be evaluated twice or not at all.

In the dual, if $f : N \to B$ and $f$ is linear:
$$f \circ (g \bullet h) = (f \circ g) \bullet h$$
holds and similarly $f$ is evaluated first in the left morphism and $h$ is evaluated first in the right. Then as above it cannot perform any effects and has to treat its *input* linearly, as duplicating or dropping $h$ would make the equation fail to hold.

## Relation to Adjunctions

Briefly, the category of duploids and duploid functors is a [[reflective subcategory]] of the category of adjunctions and morphisms of adjunctions.

First, we construct a duploid from an adjunction. To give a symmetric presentation, start with a [[profunctor]] $O : C_- &#x21F8; C_+$. This gives us a notion of "oblique-" or [[heteromorphism|hetero-]]morphism from a positive object $P \in C_+$ to a negative object $N \in C-$ as $O(P,N)$. Then let $F \dashv G$ be adjoint functors representing $O$, i.e.:
$$ C_+(F P, N) \cong O(P,N) \cong C_-(P, G N).$$
The pre-duploid $\mathcal{D}$ has as objects $|\mathcal{D}| = |C_+| + |C_-|$ with $\varpi(P) = +, \varpi(N) = -$.
The morphisms are defined as:
$$\mathcal{D}(A,B) = O(A^+,B^-)$$

where
$$P^+ = P$$
$$N^+ = G N$$
$$P^- = F P$$
$$N^- = N$$

and identities are given by the identities/unit and counit of the adjunction:

$$\id_P : O(P, F P) \equiv C_-(F P,F P)$$
$$\id_N : O(G N, N) \equiv C_+(G N,G N)$$

To define composition of $f \in \mathcal{D}(A,B), g \in \mathcal{D}(B,C)$, we inspect $B$. If $B = P$ is positive, composition is interpreted as composition in $C_-$, using 
$$f \in O(A^+,F P) \cong C_-(F A^+, F P)$$
$$g \in O(P, C^-) \cong C_-(F P, C^-)$$
and similarly if $B = N$ is negative, composition is interpreted as composition in $C_+$, using
$$f \in O(A^+,N) \cong C_+(A^+, G N)$$
$$g \in O(G N, C^-) \cong C_+(G N, G C^-)$$

This definition makes it clear that the identities are identity and the $\bullet\bullet$ and $\circ\circ$ laws hold from identity and associativity of $C_+,C_-$.
