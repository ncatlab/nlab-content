## Idea

While a (left or right) [[adjoint]] to a [[functor]] may be understood as the best approximation (from one side or the other) of a possibly non-existent inverse, any pair of [[adjoint functors]] restricts to an [[equivalence of categories]] on [[subcategories]]. These subcategories are sometimes known as the _center_ of the adjunction, their objects are sometimes known as the [[fixed point of an endofunctor|fixed points]] of the adjunction.

The [[equivalences of categories]] that arise from fixed points of adjunctions this way are often known as [[dualities]]. Examples include [[Pontrjagin duality]], [[Gelfand duality]], [[Stone duality]], and the [[Isbell duality]] between [[commutative rings]] and [[affine schemes]].

## Definition

If $L \colon \mathcal{D} \longrightarrow \mathcal{C}$ is [[left adjoint]] to $R  \colon \mathcal{C} \longrightarrow \mathcal{D}$, then we take the [[fixed points of the endofunctor]] $F G$ to be those [[objects]] of $\mathcal{C}$ on which the [[counit of an adjunction|counit]] $\epsilon$ is an [[isomorphism]], and take the fixed points of $G F$ to be those objects of $\mathcal{D}$ on which the [[unit of an adjunction|unit]] $\eta$ is an isomorphism. The [[triangle identities]] then imply that $F$ and $G$ induce an [[equivalence of categories]] between the [[full subcategories]] of fixed points of $F G$ and the fixed points of $G F$.
