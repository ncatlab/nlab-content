## Definition

An [[(∞,1)-category]] $C$ has [[finite limit|finite]] [[(∞,1)-limits]] if it has a [[terminal object in a quasi-category|terminal object]] and for every [[object]] $x \in X$, the [[over-(∞,1)-category]] $C_{/x}$ has finite [[products]]. 

We say that such a $C$ is **locally cartesian closed** if moreover $C_{/x}$ is a [[cartesian closed (∞,1)-category]] for every object $x$.  This is equivalent to asking that the pullback functor $f^*\colon C_{\y} \to C_{\x}$, for any $f\colon x\to y$ in $C$, has a right adjoint $\Pi_f$.

## Examples

* Every (Grothendieck) [[(∞,1)-topos]] is locally cartesian closed.  This follows from the [[universal colimit|universality of colimits]] and the [[adjoint functor theorem]].

## Properties

### Internal logic

The [[internal logic]] of locally cartesian closed $(\infty,1)$-categories is conjectured ([Joyal2011](#Joyal)) to be a sort of [[homotopy type theory]] (specifically, that with intensional [[identity types]] and [[dependent products]]). For more on this see _[[relation between type theory and category theory]]_.

See also _[[internal logic of an (∞,1)-topos]]_.

### Presentations
 {#Presentations}

The following theorem should be compared with the fact that every [[locally presentable (∞,1)-category]] admits a presentation by a [[Cisinski model category]], indeed by a [[left Bousfield localization]] of a [[global model structure on simplicial presheaves]].

###### Theorem
For a locally presentable $(\infty,1)$-category $C$, the following are equivalent.

1. $C$ is locally cartesian closed.
1. [[(∞,1)-colimit|(∞,1)-Colimits]] in $C$ are [[universal colimits|stable under pullback]].
1. $C$ admits a presentation by a [[combinatorial model category|combinatorial]] [[locally cartesian closed model category]].
1. $C$ admits a presentation by a [[right proper model category|right proper]] [[Cisinski model category]].
1. $C$ admits a [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presentation]] by a [[right proper model category|right proper]] [[Bousfield localization of model categories|left Bousfield localization]] of an [[model structure on simplicial presheaves|injective model category of simplicial presheaves]].

+-- {: .query}
I have a question here. The third condition says that $C$ admits a presentation as a left Bousefield localization of a category of simplicial presheaves with the projective model structure. The fifth conditions claims this for a category of simplical presheaves with the injective model structure. How can that be?

Answer (Dylan W.): I believe the injective and projective model structures on simplicial presheaves are Quillen equivalent.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
Since [[left adjoints]] preserve colimits, the first condition implies the second.  The converse holds by the [[adjoint functor theorem]] since each slice of $C$ is locally presentable.

Suppose $M$ is a right proper Cisinski model category.  Then pullback along a fibration preserves cofibrations (since they are the monomorphisms) and weak equivalences (since $M$ is right proper).  Since $M$ is a locally cartesian closed 1-category, pullback also has a right adjoint, so it is a [[Quillen adjunction|left Quillen functor]]; thus the fourth condition implies the third.  Since left Quillen functors preserve homotopy colimits, the third condition implies the second.

Clearly the fifth condition implies the fourth, so it suffices to show that the second condition implies the fifth.  For that, see [this blog comment](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2012/05/the_mysterious_nature_of_right.html#c041306) by [[Denis-Charles Cisinski]].  An alternative proof can be found in [(Gepner-Kock)](#GepnerKock).
