## Definition

An [[(∞,1)-category]] $C$ has [[finite limit|finite]] [[(∞,1)-limits]] if it has a [[terminal object in a quasi-category|terminal object]] and for every [[object]] $x \in X$, the [[over-(∞,1)-category]] $C_{/x}$ has finite [[products]]. 

We say that such a $C$ is **locally cartesian closed** if moreover $C_{/x}$ is a [[cartesian closed (∞,1)-category]] for every object $x$.

## Examples

* Every (Grothendieck) [[(∞,1)-topos]] is locally cartesian closed.  This follows from the [[universal colimit|universality of colimits]] and the [[adjoint functor theorem]].

## Properties

### Internal logic

The [[internal logic]] of locally cartesian closed $(\infty,1)$-categories is conjectured ([Joyal2011](#Joyal)) to be a sort of [[homotopy type theory]] (specifically, that with intensional [[identity types]] and [[dependent products]]).

See also [[internal logic of an (∞,1)-topos]].
