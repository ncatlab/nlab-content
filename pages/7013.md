## Definition

An [[(∞,1)-category]] $C$ has [[finite limit|finite]] [[(∞,1)-limits]] if it has a [[terminal object in a quasi-category|terminal object]] and for every [[object]] $x \in X$, the [[over-(∞,1)-category]] $C_{/x}$ has finite [[products]]. 

We say that such a $C$ is **locally cartesian closed** if moreover $C_{/x}$ is a [[cartesian closed (∞,1)-category]] for every object $x$.  This is equivalent to asking that the pullback functor $f^*\colon C_{\y} \to C_{\x}$, for any $f\colon x\to y$ in $C$, has a right adjoint $\Pi_f$.

## Examples

* Every (Grothendieck) [[(∞,1)-topos]] is locally cartesian closed.  This follows from the [[universal colimit|universality of colimits]] and the [[adjoint functor theorem]].

The following theorem should be compared with the fact that every [[locally presentable (∞,1)-category]] admits a presentation by a [[Cisinski model category]], indeed by a [[left Bousfield localization]] of a [[global model structure on simplicial presheaves]].

###### Theorem
For a locally presentable $(\infty,1)$-category $C$, the following are equivalent.

1. $C$ is locally cartesian closed.
1. [[(∞,1)-colimit|(∞,1)-Colimits]] in $C$ are [[universal colimits|stable under pullback]].
1. $C$ admits a presentation by a [[combinatorial model category|combinatorial]] [[locally cartesian closed model category]].
1. $C$ admits a presentation by a [[right proper model category|right proper]] [[Cisinski model category]].
1. $C$ admits a [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presentation]] by a [[right proper model category|right proper]] [[Bousfield localization of model categories|left Bousfield localization]] of an [[model structure on simplicial presheaves|injective model category of simplicial presheaves]].

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
Since [[left adjoints]] preserve colimits, the first condition implies the second.  The converse holds by the [[adjoint functor theorem]] since each slice of $C$ is locally presentable.

Suppose $M$ is a right proper Cisinski model category.  Then pullback along a fibration preserves cofibrations (since they are the monomorphisms) and weak equivalences (since $M$ is right proper).  Since $M$ is a locally cartesian closed 1-category, pullback also has a right adjoint, so it is a [[Quillen adjunction|left Quillen functor]]; thus the fourth condition implies the third.  Since left Quillen functors preserve homotopy colimits, the third condition implies the second.

Clearly the fifth condition implies the fourth, so it suffices to show that the second condition implies the fifth.  For that, see [this blog comment](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2012/05/the_mysterious_nature_of_right.html#c041306) by [[Denis-Charles Cisinski]].  An alternative proof can be found in [(Gepner-Kock 12)](#GepnerKock12).

###### Remark

Comparing the third and the fifth item in prop. \ref{Presentations}
notice that the projective and the injective [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] are [[Quillen equivalence|Quillen equivalent]] (as discussed at _[[model structure on functors]]_.)

### Internal logic and homotopy type theory
 {#InternalLogic}

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

Prop. \ref{Presentations} says in particular that every presentable and locally cartesian closed $(\infinity,1)$-category has a presentation by a [[type-theoretic model category]]. As discussed there, such provides the [[categorical semantics]] for [[homotopy type theory]] (without, possibly, the [[univalence]] [[axiom]]).

Therefore prop. \ref{Presentations} says in particular that "Every presentable locally cartesian closed $(\infinity,1)$-category interprets homotopy type theory."

This includes in particular all ([[∞-stack]]-) [[(∞,1)-toposes]] (which should in addition satisfy [[univalence]]). See also at _[[internal logic of an (∞,1)-topos]]_.

It seems that [[Chris Kapulkin]] is close to establishing an actual [[equivalence]], in a suitable sense, between homotopy type theories (without possibly univalence) and presentable locally Cartesian closed $(\infty,1)$-Categories, in higher analogy of the [[relation between type theory and category theory ]] (see there for more).

The [[internal logic]] of (presentable) locally cartesian closed $(\infty,1)$-categories was explicitly conjectured in ([Joyal 2011](#Joyal11)) to be a sort of [[homotopy type theory]] (specifically, that with intensional [[identity types]] and [[dependent products]]).
