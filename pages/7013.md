## Definition

An [[(∞,1)-category]] $C$ has [[finite limit]] [[(∞,1)-limits]] if it has a [[terminal object in a quasi-category|terminal object]] and the [[over-(∞,1)-category]] $C_{/x}$ has finite [[products]] for every [[object]] $x \in X$. 

An $(\infty,1)$-category $C$ with finite limits is **locally cartesian closed** if moreover $C_{/x}$ a [[cartesian closed (∞,1)-category]] for every object $x$.

## Examples

* Every [[(∞,1)-topos]] is locally cartesian closed.

## Properties

### Internal logic

The [[internal logic]] of locally cartesian closed $(\infty,1)$-categories is conjectured ([Joyal2011](#Joyal)) to be precisely [[homotopy type theory]].

See also [[internal logic of an (∞,1)-topos]].
