A stub for now.

The basic goal of this page is to turn Domenico's and Urs' statements about connections into statements about commutative diagrams.

The rough is idea is:

$$\text{Higher Connection Flat}\quad\quad\simeq\quad\quad\text{Higher Diagram Commutes}$$

[Domenico](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Vanilla/nForum/comments.php?DiscussionID=723&Focus=5015#Comment_5015): I guess this is well known, but let me try writing it here and see what happens.

If a connection on a principal G-bundle is locally represented by the 1-form $\omega$ with values in $\mathfrak{g}$, then the connection is flat if and only if the curvature 2-form $F=d\omega+\frac{1}{2}[\omega,\omega]$ vanishes, that is, if $\omega$ is a solution of the Maurer-Cartan equation.

Now, what is interesting is that one can see curvature only on 2-dimensional paths (it is a 2-form): if one restricts $\omega$ to a 1-dimensional submanifold, then there $\omega$ is clearly a solution to the Maurer-Cartan equation. so, if I think of an infinitesimal 1-simplex and look at my connection there, I could say that my connection is 1-flat. then, moving to an infinitesimal 2-simplex I see that the connection is (generally) not 2-flat: holonomy along two sides of the 2-simplex is not the same thing as holonomy along the third side. not the same, but in a very precise way: the curvature $FF$ exactly measures the gap to go from a horn of the 2-simplex to the third edge. this is very 2-categorical, and suggests I could cure the lack of flatness of my original connection by adding a copy of $\mathfrak{g}$ in degree -1 and cooking up a 2-Lie algebra $\mathfrak{l}$. Maurer-Cartan equation for this 2-Lie algebra would coincide with the original one one the 1-simplex (since only degree 1 elements are 1-forms with values in $\mathfrak{l}_0$. but on the 2-simplex we would have, in addition to these elements, also 2-forms with coefficients in $\mathfrak{l}_{-1}$, and the Maurer-Cartan equation on teh simplex would look like $d\omega+\frac{1}{2}[\omega,\omega]+\delta F=0$ where $\delta\colon \mathfrak{l}_{-1}\to \mathfrak{l}_{0}$ is the differential of the $L_\infty-algebra \mathfrak{l}$ (and it should be induced by the identity of $\mathfrak{g}$, thought as a degree 1 map from $\mathfrak{g}[-1]$ to $\mathfrak{g}$). So the original equation telling that $\omega$ had curvature $F$ is now equivalent to say that $\omega+F$ is flat.

in other words, what seemed a non-flat connection was so since I was not seeing the 2-bundle, but only a 1-bundle approximation. and on a 1-bundle I can only clearly see up to 1-simplices, wher my connection was actually flat.

once curvature has come in, we can repeat the argument: now we have a 2-flat connection and test it on the 3-simplex. if it has 3-curvature, that will presumibly be because we are not seeing the 3-bundle, yet. so I find it natural to wonder (to conjecture) whether any connection on a principal bundle (and more generally any $n$-flat connection on an n-bundle) can be seen as a flat connection on an $\infty$-bundle.

[Domenico](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Vanilla/nForum/comments.php?DiscussionID=723&Focus=5050#Comment_5050): I think I could take the task of working a bit on oo-Lie algebroid valued forms in the direction sketched above. yet, I'd like to still discuss it a bit here, sicne I'm now thinking of some more radical change. what I'm thinking is that the one-step definition as it is now is too strict. I mean, we are now defining flat $\mathfrak{a}$-connections as a morphism $\prod^{inf}(X)\to\mathfrak{a}$, and then general connections as something which becomes flat in a single step, i.e., going from $\mathfrak{a}$ to $cone(\mathfrak{a}$). why should we restrict to this? it would be natural to consider thigs that become flat in 2 sterps, 3, steps, and so on. eventually we could have things which "become flat after infinity steps" (and by the way this vague notion seems to me to better fit with classical $\mathfrak{g}$-connections).

let us see things the other way round: when we say flat, we mean flat in an $\infty$-categorical sense, so let us stress this by saying that a morphism $\prod^{inf}(X)\to\mathfrak{a}$ is an $\infty$-flat connection with values in $\mathfrak{a}$. then, what we are currently calling non-necessarily-flat $\mathfrak{a}$-connections would be the $(\infty-1)$-flat connections with values in $\mathfrak{a}$. but starting from $\infty$ is not too practical.., let us start from 0 instead.

the one-step definition of non-flat connections is reflected in the one step going from the 0-groupoid $X$ to the $\infty$-groupoid $\prod^{inf}(X)$. but we have a whole tower of higher and higher groupoids in between: the $n$-skeleta of $\prod^{inf}(X)$. so we have

$$X=\prod^{inf}(X)_{(0)}\hookrightarrow \prod^{inf}(X)_{(1)}\hookrightarrow \prod^{inf}(X)_{(2)}\hookrightarrow \cdots \hookrightarrow \prod^{inf}(X)$$

and we can talk of an $n$-flat connection with values in $\mathfrak{a}$ as a morphism $\prod^{inf}(X)_{(n)}\to \mathfrak{a}$. this will not lift to a morphism $\prod^{inf}(X)_{(n+1)}\to \mathfrak{a}$ unless the connection is $(n+1)$-flat, but will lift to a morphism $\prod^{inf}(X)_{(n+1)}\to cone(\mathfrak{a})$. the limit of this procedure will produce a "true connection" with values in $cone(cone(\cdots(cone(\mathfrak{a}))\cdots)$.

I have a vague feeling that starting with a 0-falt $\mathfrak{o}(n)$-connection one will this way meet the series $\mathfrak{so}(n), \mathfrak{spin}(n), \mathfrak{string}(n), \mathfrak{fivebrane}(n), \mathfrak{uniray}(n)$,..., but I have to think more carefully to this.
