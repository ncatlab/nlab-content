## Idea

_Abstract model theory_ is the study of the general properties of the [[model theory]] of extensions of (classical untyped) [[first-order logic]].

Originally motivated by _[[Lindström's theorem]]_ that characterizes first-order logic, the field has subsequently been extended to provide alternative characterizations and include different logics within its range.

The basic concept of abstract model theory is that of an _abstract logic_
which is  a triple $\mathcal{L}=(S, \Phi ,\models)$ where $\models$ is a binary relation between the class of $\mathcal{L}$-'structures' $S$ and the class of $\mathcal{L}$-'sentences' $\Phi$ to be thought of as minimalistic version of the  _satisfaction_ relation.
