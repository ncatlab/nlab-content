## Idea

A **cohesive site** is a small [[site]] whose [[topos of sheaves]] is a [[cohesive topos]].

## Definition

Let $C$ be a small [[site]], i.e. a [[small category]] equipped with a [[Grothendieck topology]].  We say that $C$ is a **cohesive site** if

1. $C$ has finite [[products]].

1. The coverage on $C$ makes it a [[locally connected site]], i.e. every [[cover|covering]] [[sieve]] on an object $U\in C$ is [[connected category|connected]] as a [[subcategory]] of the [[slice category]] $C/U$.

1. Every object $U\in C$ admits a [[global section]] $*\to U$.

1. (more conditions?)

## Sheaves on cohesive sites

We claim that the topos $Sh(C)$ of sheaves on a cohesive site $C$ is a [[cohesive topos]].  We will write $Disc = L Const$ for the [[inverse image functor]] of the [[global sections]] [[geometric morphism]] $(L Const, \Gamma)\colon Sh(C) \to Set$, since it constructs [[discrete objects]] in the cohesive topos $Sh(C)$.

Firstly, since $C$ is a [[locally connected site]], any constant presheaf is a sheaf.  This implies that the functor $Disc$ has a further left adjoint given by taking colimits over $C^{op}$, which we denote $\Pi_0$.  Hence $Sh(C)$ is a [[locally connected topos]].

Moreover, since $C$ has finite products, it is in particular [[cosifted category|cosifted]], and therefore $\Pi_0$ preserves finite products.  In particular, $Sh(C)$ is [[connected topos|connected]] and even *strongly connected*.

Next, we claim that $C$ is a [[local site]].  This means that its [[terminal object]] $*$ is *cover-irreducible*, i.e. any covering [[sieve]] of $*$ must contain its identity map.  But since $C$ is a locally connected site, every covering family is inhabited, and since every object has a global section, every covering sieve must include a global section.  In the case of $*$, the only global section is an identity map; hence $C$ is a local site, and so $Sh(C)$ is a [[local topos]].  The right adjoint $Codisc$ of $\Gamma$ is defined by
$$ Codisc(A)(U) = A^{C(*,U)} = A^{\Gamma(U)}.$$

We now claim that the transformation $Disc(A) \to Codisc(A)$ is [[monic]].  Since sheaves are closed under limits in presheaves, this condition can be checked pointwise at each object $U\in C$.  But since constant presheaves are sheaves, the map $Disc(A)(U) \to Codisc(A)(U)$ is just the [[diagonal morphism|diagonal]]
$$ A \to A^{C(*,U)} $$
which is monic since $C(*,U)$ is always inhabited (by assumption on $C$).

Thus, it remains to show "continuity" of $\Pi_0$. ...

## Examples

### Families of sets {#FamiliesOfSets}

Here is a simplistic example (or counterexample depending 
on which axioms we want to satisfy, see below).

Consider the site given by the [[interval category]] 

$$
  C = \{\emptyset \to *\}
$$

with trivial topology. The category of sheaves = presheaves on this is the [[arrow category]] $Arr(Set)$.

$$
  X : (\emptyset \to *) \mapsto (I \leftarrow S)
  \,.
$$

We find

* $\Gamma : (I \leftarrow S) \mapsto S$

* $\Pi_0 : (I \leftarrow S) \mapsto I$.

We may interpret this as follows: by decomposing $S$ into its [[fiber]]s, an object $(I \leftarrow S)$ is an $I$-indexed family of sets: $S = \coprod_i S_i$. The "cohesive pieces" are the $S_i$ and there are $|I|$-many of them. This is what $\Pi_0$ computes.

Moreover we find for $K \in Set$:

* $Disc : K \mapsto (K \stackrel{Id}{\leftarrow} K)$;

* $Codisc : K \mapsto (* \stackrel{}{\leftarrow} K)$

(and evidently both these functors are full and faithful).

This matches the interpretation we just found: $Disc K$ is the collection of elements of $K$ with no two of them lumped together by cohesion, while $Codisc K$ is all elements of $K$ lumped together.

What is not true in this example is that $Disc K \to Codisc K$ is a monomorphism.

In particular, notice that the fibers $S_i$ may be empty. This is notably the case for the object $y(\emptyset) = (* \leftarrow \emptyset)$ represented by $\emptyset$.


### Sites of balls;

Any full small subcategory of [[Top]] on [[connected]] topological spaces with the canonical induced [[open cover]] [[coverage]] is a cohesive site. If a subcategory on [[contractible]] spaces, then this is also an [[(∞,1)-cohesive site]]. 

This includes notably the category [[CartSp]] of all [[open ball]]s (with either continuous maps or smooth maps as morphism). 
 


## Related concepts

An [[(n,1)-cohesive site]] is a site whose [[(n,1)-topos]] of $n$-sheaves is [[cohesive (n,1)-topos|cohesive]], and an [[(∞,1)-cohesive site]] is a site whose [[(∞,1)-topos]] of sheaves is [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos|cohesive]].
