#Idea#

The $A_\infty$-operad is the free resolution 
in the context of dg-operads of the linear
associative [[operad]] $A$.

[[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: Evidently some people use the terminology this way, but for many people there is no 'the' $A_\infty$-operad.  Rather _an_ $A_\infty$-operad is any operad equivalent to the associative operad (in whatever enrichment we are working).  Likewise, an $A_\infty$-algebra is an algebra for _some_ $A_\infty$-operad.

If we want a page about this particular operad, could we call it maybe [[standard linear A-infinity-operad]]?  Or [[linear Stasheff operad]] since, as Jim Stasheff pointed out at the cafe, it is the operad of cellular chains on the standard topological $A_\infty$-operad of associahedra?

#Definition#

Recall that the linear associative operad $A$ is the 
operad in vector spaces generated by a single binary operation
$$
  \array{
    \searrow && \swarrow
    \\
    & * 
    \\
    & \downarrow
  }
$$
modulo the ideal generated by the element
$$
  \array{
    \searrow && \swarrow &&&& \swarrow
    \\
    & * && 
    \\
    && \searrow && \swarrow
    \\
    &&& *
    \\
    &&&
    \downarrow
  }
  -
  \array{
    \searrow && &&\searrow && \swarrow
    \\
    &  &&&& * 
    \\
    && \searrow && \swarrow
    \\
    &&& *
    \\
    &&&
    \downarrow
  }  
  \,.
$$

We may regard this operad as in operad enriched in 
[[cochain complex]]es $Ch^\bullet(Vect)$ and concentrated in degree 0.

######Definition

The **$A_\infty$-operad** is the dg-operad

* freely generated from one $n$-ary operation $f_n$ for each $n \geq 1$, taken to be in degree
$2 - n$;

* with the differential of the $n$th generator given by
$$ -
\sum_{j+p+q = n}^{1 \lt p \lt n} (-1)^{j p + q} a_{p,j,n} ,$$
where $a_{p,j,n}$ is $f_p$ attachched to the $(j+1)$st input of $f_{n}$.
