## Idea

Given a [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$, by a _localizer_ in $\mathcal{C}$ (or on $\mathcal{C}$) is often meant to be a [[class]] $W \subset Mor(\mathcal{C})$ of [[morphisms]] in $\mathcal{C}$ such that $(\mathcal{C},W)$ is a [[category with weak equivalences]], intended as the input datum for the ([[simplicial localization|simplicial]]) [[localization]] of $\mathcal{C}$ at $W$. Typically there are some extra conditions imposed on what constitutes a localizer in a given context.

## Examples

The term appears for instance in the discussion of [[Cisinski model structures]], see that _[Cisinski model structure -- Localizers](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Cisinski+model+structure#ALocalizers)_.

It also appears as the notion of _[[basic localizers]]_ on [[Cat]].
