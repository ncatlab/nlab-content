## Idea

The second [[stable homotopy group of spheres]] (the second [[stable stem]]) is the [[cyclic group of order 2]]:

\[
  \label{ComplexHopfFibrationGeneratingpi1}
  \array{
    \pi_1^s &\simeq& \mathbb{Z}/2
  }
\]

## Related concepts

## References

[[Lev Pontryagin|Pontryagin]] had announced the computation via [[Pontryagin's theorem]] in [[cobordism theory]] already in 1930, at the International Congress of Mathematics, and had introduced the concept of [[surgery]] in the process, but there was a mistake left ([Pontrjagin 38b](#Pontrjagin38b)), fixed later by [Pontryagin 50](#Pontryagin50), [Whitehead 50](#Whitehead50). For historical commentary see also [p. 6](https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0211216.pdf#page=6) of [[Michael Hopkins|Hopkins]]&[[Isadore Singer|Singer]]'s _[[Quadratic Functions in Geometry, Topology, and M-Theory]]_ and [[Michael Hopkins|Hopkins]]'s talk at [Atiyah's 80th Birthday conference](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~v1ranick/atiyah80.htm), [slide 8](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~v1ranick/hopkins.pdf#page=8), [9:45](https://empg.maths.ed.ac.uk/Videos/Atiyah80/Hopkins.mov).
