## Idea

The second [[stable homotopy group of spheres]] (the second [[stable stem]]) is the [[cyclic group of order 2]]:

\[
  \label{ComplexHopfFibrationGeneratingpi1}
  \array{
    \pi_1^s &\simeq& \mathbb{Z}/2
  }
\]

(Pontryagin had announced the computation already in 1930, at the International Congress of Mathematics, and had introduced the concept of [[surgery]] in the process, but there was a mistake. Some comments on the history are given in [[Michael Hopkins|Hopkins]]'s talk at [Atiyah's 80th Birthday conference](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~v1ranick/atiyah80.htm), see [slide 8](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~v1ranick/hopkins.pdf#page=8), [9:45](https://empg.maths.ed.ac.uk/Videos/Atiyah80/Hopkins.mov).)
