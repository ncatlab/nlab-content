**Caveat Lector.**
This section may duplicate/contradict other nLab accounts of similar lemmas. This section, its title, and its place in the present article, are tentative. Also, the title is somewhat of a misnomer since many of the lemmas intended to be collected (or linked) here are about categories which are _not_ abelian categories. The section is meant to be a place to collect lemmas asserting that the existence of one type of morphisms in one part of a commutative diagram implies that some other morphism in the diagram must have some type.

### lemmas on pushouts 

A pushout implying a pullback via [[monomorphism]] (resp. [[strong monomorphism]]), in [[topos]] (resp. [[quasitopos]])

Suppose that $(\mathrm{T},\mathrm{C})$ is either

* (monomorphism,topos), or
* (strong monomorphism,quasitopos)

Suppose that 
$$\array{
O_{0,1} & \to & O_{1,1} \\
\downarrow m &&\downarrow h  \\
O_{0,0} & \to & O_{1,0}
}$$
is a commutative diagram in a category $\mathcal{C}$  such that 

* * $\mathcal{C}$ is $\mathrm{C}$
* * $m$ is $\mathrm{T}$ in $\mathcal{C}$
* * the diagram is a pushout in $\mathcal{C}$


Then 

* * $h$ is $\mathrm{T}$ in $\mathcal{C}$
* * the diagram is a pullback in $\mathcal{C}$


(cf. [[quasitopos]], Section "Properties")
### lemmas on equalizers 

An equalizer diagram implying an equalizer diagram, via monos and a pullback square. 

Suppose $\mathcal{C}$ is any category with equalizers. 
Suppose 

$$\array{
O_{0,1} & \to & O_{1,1} & \underoverset{\quad {}_0f_{1} \quad}{{}_1f_{1}}{\rightrightarrows} & O_{2,1} &  & &  & \\
\downarrow m_0 &&\downarrow m_1 &&\downarrow m_2 &&  &&  \\
O_{0,0} & \to & O_{1,0} & \underoverset{\quad {}_0f_{0} \quad}{ {}_1f_{0} }{\rightrightarrows} & O_{2,0}  & &  & 
}$$

is a diagram in $\mathcal{C}$ in which 

* * each of $m_0$,$m_1$, $m_2$ is monic
* * the square is a pullback
* * the lower row is an equalizer

Then 

* * its upper row is an equalizer
