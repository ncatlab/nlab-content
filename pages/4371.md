# Double negation

## Idea

In [[logic]], double negation is the operation that takes $P$ to $\neg{\neg{P}}$, where $\neg$ is [[negation]].  In other words, double negation is the [[composite]] of [[negation]] with itself. This is a [[closure operator]]/[[modality]] and as such a special case of a [[continuation monad]].


## In logic

In [[classical logic]], the double negation of any [[truth value]] or [[proposition]] is itself.  More abstractly, double negation is the [[identity function]] on any [[boolean algebra]].


In [[intuitionistic logic]], double negation is weaker than the identity.  That is, we have $P \Rightarrow \neg{\neg{P}}$ but not conversely.  In [[paraconsistent logic]], it is the other way around.  More abstractly, this holds in any [[Heyting algebra]] (intuitionistic) or its dual (paraconsistent).

In [[linear logic]], double negation is the identity again, although linear logic also has notions of intuitionistic negation and paraconsistent negation which act as above.


## In locale theory

Even in [[classical mathematics]], a [[frame]] is a Heyting algebra but not a boolean algebra.  Accordingly, double negation is usually not the identity on a frame.  However, the operation of double negation is a [[nucleus]] on any frame.

Thus, every [[locale]] $L$ has a [[sublocale]] given by that nucleus, called the __double negation sublocale__ and denoted $L_{\neg\neg}$.  This sublocale is [[dense sublocale|dense]], and in fact it is the smallest dense sublocale of $L$, the [[intersection]] of all dense sublocales.

Classically, we have $L = L_{\neg\neg}$ if and only if $L$ is the [[discrete locale]] on some [[set]] $S$ of points.  In [[constructive mathematics]], $S$ must also have [[decidable equality]].

###### Example

Let $\mathcal{O}_X$ be the sheaf of [[continuous map|continuous]] (or [[smooth map|smooth]], or [[holomorphic map|holomorphic]], or [[regular map|regular]]) functions on a [[topological space]] (or [[smooth manifold]], or [[complex manifold]], or [[reduced scheme]]) $X$. Then the [[direct image|pushforward]] of the [[inverse image|pullback]] of $\mathcal{O}_X$ to the smallest dense sublocale of $X$ is the sheaf of [[meromorphic functions]] on $X$ (i.e. sections over an open subset $U$ are given by sections of $\mathcal{O}_X$ defined on some dense open subset $V \subseteq U$).
=--


## In topos theory

The notion of double negation sublocale may be [[categorification|categorified]] from locales to [[toposes]].  

If $E$ is a [[topos]] with [[subobject classifier]] $\Omega$, there is a [[negation]] operator $\neg \colon \Omega \to \Omega$, defined by virtue of the fact that $\Omega$ is an [[internalisation|internal]] [[Heyting algebra]].  


### Definition

+-- {: .num_defn #DoubleNegationTopology}
###### Definition/Proposition

The double negation morphism

$$
  \not \not \colon \Omega \to \Omega
$$

constitutes a [[Lawvere-Tierney topology]] on $\mathcal{E}$.

This is called the **double negation topology**.
=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof 
The topology axioms can be formulated in purely equational form, i.e., as equations between operations of the form $\Omega^n \to \Omega$. By the Yoneda lemma, it suffices to verify the corresponding equations between transformations $Hom(-, \Omega)^n \to Hom(-, \Omega)$, which boils the problem down to checking the equations for ordinary Heyting algebras in $Set$. For ordinary Heyting algebras, proofs may be found [here](Heyting+algebra#ToBooleanAlgebras).
=--


### Properties

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The sheaf topos $\mathcal{E}_{\not \not} \hookrightarrow \mathcal{E}$ corresponding to the [double negation topology](#DoubleNegationTopology) is a [[Boolean topos]].

=--

This appears for sheaf toposes as ([MacLaneMoerdijk, theorem VI 3](#MacLaneMoerdijk)), and in the general case as a special case of ([Johnstone, Lemma A4.5.21](#Johnstone)).

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition
$\mathcal{E}_{\not \not} \hookrightarrow \mathcal{E}$ is the smallest [[dense subtopos]].
=--

([Johnstone, below Corollary A4.5.20](#Johnstone))

+-- {: .num_prop #largest_topology}
###### Proposition
$\not\not$ is the unique largest topology in $\mathcal{E}$ for which $0\rightarrowtail 1$ is closed.
=--

For a proof see ([Johnstone (1977)](#Johnstone77), p.140).

Both of the preceding results imply in particular that **$0$ is always a $\not\not$-sheaf**, i.e. $\mathcal{E}_{\not\not}$ is always a [[dense subtopos]].  In fact, we have:

+-- {: .num_prop #boolean_subtopos}
###### Proposition
$\not\not$ is the unique topology $j$ such that (1) $j$ is [[dense subtopos|dense]], i.e. $j(0)=0$, and (2) the sheaf topos $\mathcal{E}_j$ is [[Boolean topos|Boolean]].
=--
+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
It remains to show that (1) and (2) imply that $j=\not\not$.  First note that the dense monos corresponding to $j$ are classified by the subobject classifier $\Omega_j$ of $\mathcal{E}_j$.  Since (2) implies that $\Omega_j$ is an internal [[Boolean algebra]], it follows that the dense subobjects of any object $X$ form a Boolean algebra.

This Boolean algebra is a reflective sub-poset of the [[Heyting algebra]] of all subobjects of $X$, whose reflector is lex, i.e. preserves finite [[meets]].  Thus, it will suffice to show that if $B$ is a Boolean algebra that is a lex-reflective sub-poset of a Heyting algebra $H$ and if $0\in B$, then $B = \{ U | U = \neg\neg U \}$.

To show this, first note that the Boolean negation in $B$ is the restriction of the Heyting negation in $H$.  Thus, Booleanness of $B$ implies $U=\neg\neg U$ for all $U\in B$.  Thus, it remains to show that if $U=\neg\neg U$ then $U\in B$.  But since $0\in B$ and $B$ is an [[exponential ideal]], by the definition $\neg U = (U\Rightarrow 0)$ it follows that $\neg\neg U\in B$ for any $U$.  Thus, if $U=\neg\neg U$ then $U\in B$ as well.

+-- {: .num_prop #RelationToAufhebungof01}
###### Proposition

As the [[Aufhebung]] $\mathcal{E}_j$ of $0 \dashv 1$ (a [[sharp modality]] satisfying $\sharp 0 \simeq 0$) is necessarily dense it follows that $\mathcal{E}_{\neg\neg}\subseteq \mathcal{E}_j$ in general and $\mathcal{E}_{\neg\neg}=\mathcal{E}_j$ in case the former is an [[essential geometric morphism|essential]] subtopos ([Lawvere 91, p. 8](#Lawvere91), for further details cf. _[[Aufhebung]]_).

=--



The next two propositions consider the important special case of $\neg\neg$ on [[presheaf topos|presheaf toposes]]:

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition
For every [[presheaf topos]] $[C^{op}, Set]$ the double negation topology coincides with the [[dense topology]].
=--

This appears as [MacLaneMoerdijk, corollary VI 5](#MacLaneMoerdijk).

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Let $C$ be a [[poset]]. Then the double negation sheaf topos
$ Sh_{\not \not}(C) \hookrightarrow [C^{op}, Set]$
satisfies the [[axiom of choice]].
=--

This appears as [MacLaneMoerdijk, corollary VI 9](#MacLaneMoerdijk).  Essentially because of this fact, double-negation sheaves on posets are the basic context for [[forcing]] in set theory (since set theorists generally want the axiom of choice to be preserved in forcing models.)


## In higher topos theory
 {#InHigherToposTheory}

[[classical logic|Classically]] the double negation modality is equivalent to the [[n-truncation modality]] for $n = -1$ (the [[bracket type]]).  In general, it\'s still true that double negation takes any type (object in the higher topos) to a $(-1)$-type, but the bracket type ${\|A\|_{-1}}$ only entails the double negation $\neg(\neg{A})$:

there is a canonical [[function]]

$$
  {\|A\|_{-1}} \longrightarrow \neg(\neg{A})
$$

and this is a [[1-epimorphism]] precisely if the [[law of excluded middle]] holds.

> The base in fact seems in examples to be determined by the given category of Being itself, either as the latter's QD reflection with the extra localness condition supplying the right adjoint pure Becoming inclusion, or else (for example simplicial sets) as the double-negation sheaves with the extra essentialness condition supplying the left adjoint inclusion (in the latter case it is in Hegelian fashion always the smallest level for which both 0,1 are sheaves).
