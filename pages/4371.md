## Idea

In [[logic]], double negation is the operation that takes $P$ to $\neg{\neg{P}}$, where $\neg$ is [[negation]].  In other words, double negation is the [[composite]] of [[negation]] with itself. This is a [[closure operator]]/[[modality]] and as such a special case of a [[continuation monad]].


## In logic

In [[classical logic]], the double negation of any [[truth value]] or [[proposition]] is itself.  More abstractly, double negation is the [[identity function]] on any [[boolean algebra]].


In [[intuitionistic logic]], double negation is weaker than the identity.  That is, we have $P \Rightarrow \neg{\neg{P}}$ but not conversely.  In [[paraconsistent logic]], it is the other way around.  More abstractly, this holds in any [[Heyting algebra]] (intuitionistic) or its dual (paraconsistent).

In [[linear logic]], double negation is the identity again, although linear logic also has notions of intuitionistic negation and paraconsistent negation which act as above.


## In locale theory

Even in [[classical mathematics]], a [[frame]] is a Heyting algebra but not a boolean algebra.  Accordingly, double negation is usually not the identity on a frame.  However, the operation of double negation is a [[nucleus]] on any frame.

Thus, every [[locale]] $L$ has a [[sublocale]] given by that nucleus, called the __double negation sublocale__ and denoted $L_{\neg\neg}$.  This sublocale is [[dense sublocale|dense]], and in fact it is the smallest dense sublocale of $L$, the [[intersection]] of all dense sublocales.

Classically, we have $L = L_{\neg\neg}$ if and only if $L$ is the [[discrete locale]] on some [[set]] $S$ of points.  In [[constructive mathematics]], $S$ must also have [[decidable equality]].

###### Example

Let $\mathcal{O}_X$ be the sheaf of [[continuous map|continuous]] (or [[smooth map|smooth]], or [[holomorphic map|holomorphic]], or [[regular map|regular]]) functions on a [[topological space]] (or [[smooth manifold]], or [[complex manifold]], or [[reduced scheme]]) $X$. Then the [[direct image|pushforward]] of the [[inverse image|pullback]] of $\mathcal{O}_X$ to the smallest dense sublocale of $X$ is the sheaf of [[meromorphic functions]] on $X$ (i.e. sections over an open subset $U$ are given by sections of $\mathcal{O}_X$ defined on some dense open subset $V \subseteq U$).
=--


## In topos theory

The notion of double negation sublocale may be [[categorification|categorified]] from locales to [[toposes]].  

If $E$ is a [[topos]] with [[subobject classifier]] $\Omega$, there is a [[negation]] operator $\neg \colon \Omega \to \Omega$, defined by virtue of the fact that $\Omega$ is an [[internalisation|internal]] [[Heyting algebra]].  


### Definition

+-- {: .num_defn #DoubleNegationTopology}
###### Definition/Proposition

The double negation morphism

$$
  \not \not \colon \Omega \to \Omega
$$

constitutes a [[Lawvere-Tierney topology]] on $\mathcal{E}$.

This is called the **double negation topology**.
=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof 
The topology axioms can be formulated in purely equational form, i.e., as equations between operations of the form $\Omega^n \to \Omega$. By the Yoneda lemma, it suffices to verify the corresponding equations between transformations $Hom(-, \Omega)^n \to Hom(-, \Omega)$, which boils the problem down to checking the equations for ordinary Heyting algebras in $Set$. For ordinary Heyting algebras, proofs may be found [here](Heyting+algebra#ToBooleanAlgebras).
=--


### Properties

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The sheaf topos $\mathcal{E}_{\not \not} \hookrightarrow \mathcal{E}$ corresponding to the [double negation topology](#DoubleNegationTopology) is a [[Boolean topos]].

=--

This appears for sheaf toposes as ([MacLaneMoerdijk, theorem VI 3](#MacLaneMoerdijk)), and in the general case as a special case of ([Johnstone, Lemma A4.5.21](#Johnstone)).

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition
$\mathcal{E}_{\not \not} \hookrightarrow \mathcal{E}$ is the smallest [[dense subtopos]].
=--

([Johnstone, below Corollary A4.5.20](#Johnstone))

+-- {: .num_prop #largest_topology}
###### Proposition
$\not\not$ is the unique largest topology in $\mathcal{E}$ for which $0\rightarrowtail 1$ is closed.
=--

For a proof see ([Johnstone (1977)](#Johnstone77), p.140).

Both of the preceding results imply in particular that **$0$ is always a $\not\not$-sheaf**, i.e. $\mathcal{E}_{\not\not}$ is always a [[dense subtopos]].  In fact, we have:

+-- {: .num_prop #boolean_subtopos}
###### Proposition
$\not\not$ is the unique topology $j$ such that (1) $j$ is [[dense subtopos|dense]], i.e. $j(0)=0$, and (2) the sheaf topos $\mathcal{E}_j$ is [[Boolean topos|Boolean]].
=--
+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
It remains to show that (1) and (2) imply that $j=\not\not$.  First note that the dense monos corresponding to $j$ are classified by the subobject classifier $\Omega_j$ of $\mathcal{E}_j$.  Since (2) implies that $\Omega_j$ is an internal [[Boolean algebra]], it follows that the dense subobjects of any object $X$ form a Boolean algebra.

This Boolean algebra is a reflective sub-poset of the [[Heyting algebra]] of all subobjects of $X$, whose reflector is lex, i.e. preserves finite [[meets]].  Thus, it will suffice to show that if $B$ is a Boolean algebra that is a lex-reflective sub-poset of a Heyting algebra $H$ and if $0\in B$, then $B = \{ U | U = \neg\neg U \}$.

To show this, first note that the Boolean negation in $B$ is the restriction of the Heyting negation in $H$.  Thus, Booleanness of $B$ implies $U=\neg\neg U$ for all $U\in B$.  Thus, it remains to show that if $U=\neg\neg U$ then $U\in B$.  But since $0\in B$ and $B$ is an [[exponential ideal]], by the definition $\neg U = (U\Rightarrow 0)$ it follows that $\neg\neg U\in B$ for any $U$.  Thus, if $U=\neg\neg U$ then $U\in B$ as well.

+-- {: .num_prop #RelationToAufhebungof01}
###### Proposition

As the [[Aufhebung]] $\mathcal{E}_j$ of $0 \dashv 1$ (a [[sharp modality]] satisfying $\sharp 0 \simeq 0$) is necessarily dense it follows that $\mathcal{E}_{\neg\neg}\subseteq \mathcal{E}_j$ in general and $\mathcal{E}_{\neg\neg}=\mathcal{E}_j$ in case the former is an [[essential geometric morphism|essential]] subtopos ([Lawvere 91, p. 8](#Lawvere91), for further details cf. _[[Aufhebung]]_).

=--



The next two propositions consider the important special case of $\neg\neg$ on [[presheaf topos|presheaf toposes]]:

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition
For every [[presheaf topos]] $[C^{op}, Set]$ the double negation topology coincides with the [[dense topology]].
=--

This appears as [MacLaneMoerdijk, corollary VI 5](#MacLaneMoerdijk).

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Let $C$ be a [[poset]]. Then the double negation sheaf topos
$ Sh_{\not \not}(C) \hookrightarrow [C^{op}, Set]$
satisfies the [[axiom of choice]].
=--

This appears as [MacLaneMoerdijk, corollary VI 9](#MacLaneMoerdijk).  Essentially because of this fact, double-negation sheaves on posets are the basic context for [[forcing]] in set theory (since set theorists generally want the axiom of choice to be preserved in forcing models.)


## In higher topos theory
 {#InHigherToposTheory}

[[classical logic|Classically]] the double negation modality is equivalent to the [[n-truncation modality]] for $n = -1$ (the [[bracket type]]).  In general, it\'s still true that double negation takes any type (object in the higher topos) to a $(-1)$-type, but the bracket type ${\|A\|_{-1}}$ only entails the double negation $\neg(\neg{A})$:

there is a canonical [[function]]

$$
  {\|A\|_{-1}} \longrightarrow \neg(\neg{A})
$$

and this is a [[1-epimorphism]] precisely if the [[law of excluded middle]] holds.
