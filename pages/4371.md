## Idea

In [[logic]], double negation is the operation that takes $P$ to $\neg{\neg{P}}$, where $\neg$ is [[negation]].  In other words, double negation is the [[composite]] of [[negation]] with itself. This is a [[closure operator]]/[[modality]].


## In logic

In [[classical logic]], the double negation of any [[truth value]] or [[proposition]] is itself.  More abstractly, double negation is the [[identity function]] on any [[boolean algebra]].


In [[intuitionistic logic]], double negation is weaker than the identity.  That is, we have $P \Rightarrow \neg{\neg{P}}$ but not conversely.  In [[paraconsistent logic]], it is the other way around.  More abstractly, this holds in any [[Heyting algebra]] (intuitionistic) or its dual (paraconsistent).

In [[linear logic]], double negation is the identity again, although linear logic also has notions of intuitionistic negation and paraconsistent negation which act as above.


## In locale theory

Even in [[classical mathematics]], a [[frame]] is a Heyting algebra but not a boolean algebra.  Accordingly, double negation is usually not the identity on a frame.  However, the operation of double negation is a [[nucleus]] on any frame.

Thus, every [[locale]] $L$ has a [[sublocale]] given by that nucleus, called the __double negation sublocale__ and denoted $L_{\neg\neg}$.  This sublocale is [[dense sublocale|dense]], and in fact it is the smallest dense sublocale of $L$, the [[intersection]] of all dense sublocales.

Classically, we have $L = L_{\neg\neg}$ if and only if $L$ is the [[discrete locale]] on some [[set]] $S$ of points.  In [[constructive mathematics]], $S$ must also have [[decidable equality]].


## In topos theory

The notion of double negation sublocale may be [[categorification|categorified]] from locales to [[toposes]].  

If $E$ is a [[topos]] with [[subobject classifier]] $\Omega$, there is a [[negation]] operator $\neg \colon \Omega \to \Omega$, defined by virtue of the fact that $\Omega$ is an [[internalisation|internal]] [[Heyting algebra]].  

### Definition

+-- {: .num_defn #DoubleNegationTopology}
###### Definition/Proposition

The double negation morphism

$$
  \not \not \colon \Omega \to \Omega
$$

constitutes a [[Lawvere-Tierney topology]] on $\mathcal{E}$.

This is called the **double negation topology**.
=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof 
The topology axioms can be formulated in purely equational form, i.e., as equations between operations of the form $\Omega^n \to \Omega$. By the Yoneda lemma, it suffices to verify the corresponding equations between transformations $Hom(-, \Omega)^n \to Hom(-, \Omega)$, which boils the problem down to checking the equations for ordinary Heyting algebras in $Set$. For ordinary Heyting algebras, proofs may be found [here](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Heyting+algebra#to_boolean_algebras_24).

### Properties

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

For $\mathcal{E}$ a [[sheaf topos]], the sheaf topos 
corresponding to its [double negation topology](#DoubleNegationTopology)

$$
  \mathcal{E}_{\not \not} \hookrightarrow \mathcal{E}
$$

is a [[Boolean topos]].
=--

This appears as [MacLaneMoerdijk, theorem VI 3](#MacLaneMoerdijk). The topos of double-negation sheaves is in fact the maximal Boolean [[subtopos]] contained in $E$. 

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

For every [[presheaf topos]] $[C^{op}, Set]$ the double negation topology coincides with the [[dense topology]].
=--

This appears as [MacLaneMoerdijk, corollary VI 5](#MacLaneMoerdijk).

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Let $C$ be a [[poset]]. Then the double negation sheaf topos

$$
  Sh_{\not \not}(C) \hookrightarrow [C^{op}, Set]
$$

satisfies the [[axiom of choice]].
=--

This appears as [MacLaneMoerdijk, corollary VI 9](#MacLaneMoerdijk).

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

In a presheaf topos (on a small category) the notions of *$\neg\neg$-topology* and that of *[[dense topology]]* coincide.
=--


## In higher topos theory

[[classical logic|Classically]] the double negation modality is equivalent to the [[n-truncation modality]] for $n = -1$ (the [[bracket type]]).  In general, it\'s still true that double negation takes any type (object in the higher topos) to a $(-1)$-type, but the bracket type ${\|A\|_{-1}}$ only entails the double negation $\neg(\neg{A})$.
