## Idea 

Let $G$ and $H$ be [[graph|simple graphs]]. Then $H$ is a **graph minor** of $G$ if it is isomorphic to a graph obtained by applying a sequence of operations of the following sort, starting from $G$: 

* Removing an edge; 

* Removing an isolated point; 

* Contracting an edge, i.e., removing an edge and identifying its endpoints. 

## Definition via subquotients 

If we define a simple graph to mean a set $V$ equipped with a symmetric reflexive relation $E$, with the evident notion of morphism, then graph minors can be equivalently described as subquotients in the category of simple graphs. 

We begin by quoting some exactness properties of the category of simple graphs (or, again, the category of sets equipped with a symmetric reflexive relation). There is an evident inclusion 

$$i: SimpGph \to Set^{\bullet \stackrel{\to}{\to} \bullet}$$ 

where the category on the right is the topos of directed graphs.

###### Theorem 
The functor $i$ preserves and reflects both finite limits and finite colimits.

The category of directed graphs can be equivalently described as the comma category $Set \downarrow sq$ where $sq: Set \to Set$ is the squaring functor. A morphism in the comma category amounts to a commutative square of the form 

$$\array{
E & \stackrel{g}{\to} & F \\
\downarrow & & \downarrow \\ 
V^2 & \underset{f^2}{\to} & W^2
}$$ 

and such may be factored according to a [[ternary factorization system]], first by factoring through a pullback square on the right (as follows): 

$$\array{
E & \to & P & \hookrightarrow & F \\
\downarrow & & \downarrow & & \downarrow \\
V^2 & \twoheadrightarrow & I^2 & \hookrightarrow & W^2
}$$ 

and then by factoring $E \to P$ into an epi followed by a mono: 

$$\array{
E & \twoheadrightarrow & J & \hookrightarrow & P \\
\downarrow & & \downarrow & & \downarrow \\
V^2 & \twoheadrightarrow & I^2 & \underset{id}{\to} & I^2.
}$$ 

This factorization means one first contracts edges, then one adds edges, and then one adds new vertices and edges which connect to the new vertices. The latter two processes provide a factorization in the class of monos in the category of directed graphs (and hence also in the category of simple graphs). 

Hence we can say that $H$ is a graph minor of $G$ if there exists a cospan 

$$\array{
G & \twoheadrightarrow & G' \\
 & & \uparrow^\mathrlap{mono} \\
 & & H
}$$ 

and the graph minor relation is evidently transitive by taking the pushout square, as follows,  

$$\array{
G & \twoheadrightarrow & G' & \twoheadrightarrow & G'' \\
 & &  ^\mathllap{mono} \uparrow & & \uparrow^\mathrlap{mono} \\
 & & H & \twoheadrightarrow & H' \\
 & & & & \uparrow^\mathrlap{mono} \\
 & & & & J
}$$

using the fact that in a topos such as $Set^{\bullet \stackrel{\to}{\to} \bullet}$, the pushout of a mono along an arrow is a mono, and also that the inclusion of simple graphs into directed graphs reflects pushouts and monos. 

For finite graphs, the graph minor relation is also antisymmetric (if $G$ and $H$ are minors of one another, then they are isomorphic). Indeed, if either the arrow $G \twoheadrightarrow G'$ or the arrow $H \hookrightarrow G'$ is not an isomorphism, then $H$ has strictly fewer edges and vertices than $G$. This is clearly not the case for infinite graphs (e.g., the infinite rooted binary tree without leaves contains as a subgraph a disjoint sum of two copies of itself). 

## Minor-closed families 

* The collection of forests is closed under the graph minor relation. 

* The collection of planar graphs is closed under the graph minor relation. 

## Graph minor theorem 

This celebrated result of Robertson and Seymour says that no collection of finite graphs, ordered by the graph minor relation, has an infinite [[antichain]]. Equivalently, that in any collection of finite graphs, there are only finitely many elements which are minimal with respect to the graph minor relation. 

As a corollary, any class $F$ of finite graphs which is closed under minors admits a **forbidden minor characterization**: is precisely the class of graphs which do not have any members of a specific finite family of graphs
as a minor. (Proof: the complement of $F$ in the poset of finite graphs has finitely many minimal members. Then, $x$ belongs to $F$ iff none of these minimal members occurs as a minor of $x$. 

For example, the class of forests is precisely the class of finite graphs which do not have a triangle $K_3$ as a minor. The class of planar graphs is precisely the class of finite graphs which do not have $K_5$ or $K_{3, 3}$ as a minor. 

Forbidden minor characterizations also exist for certain classes of [[matroid|matroids]]. (See for example Wikipedia [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matroid#Forbidden_minors).)
