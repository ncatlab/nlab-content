Let $G$ and $H$ be [[graph|simple graphs]]. Then $H$ is a **graph minor** of $G$ if it is isomorphic to a graph obtained by applying a sequence of operations of the following sort, starting from $G$: 

* Removing an edge; 

* Removing an isolated point; 

* Contracting an edge, i.e., removing an edge and identifying its endpoints. 

If we define a simple graph to mean a set $V$ equipped with a symmetric reflexive relation $E$, with the evident notion of morphism, then graph minors can be equivalently described as subquotients in the category of simple graphs. 

We begin by quoting some exactness properties of the category of simple graphs (or, again, the category of sets equipped with a symmetric reflexive relation). There is an evident inclusion 

$$i: SimpGph \to Set^{\bullet \stackrel{\to}{\to} \bullet}$$ 

where the category on the right is the topos of directed graphs.

###### Theorem 
The functor $i$ preserves and reflects both finite limits and finite colimits.

The category of directed graphs can be equivalently described as the comma category $Set \downarrow sq$ where $sq: Set \to Set$ is the squaring functor. A morphism in the comma category amounts to a commutative square of the form 

$$\array{
E & \stackrel{g}{\to} & F \\
\downarrow & & \downarrow \\ 
V^2 & \underset{f^2}{\to} & W^2
}$$ 

and such may be factored according to a [[ternary factorization system]], first by factoring through a pullback as follows:
