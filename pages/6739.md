Let $G$ and $H$ be [[graph|simple graphs]]. Then $H$ is a **graph minor** of $G$ if it is isomorphic to a graph obtained by applying a sequence of operations of the following sort, starting from $G$: 

* Removing an edge; 

* Removing an isolated point; 

* Contracting an edge, i.e., removing an edge and identifying its endpoints. 

If we define a simple graph to mean a set equipped with a symmetric reflexive relation, with the evident notion of morphism, then graph minors can be equivalently described as subquotients in the category of simple graphs.
