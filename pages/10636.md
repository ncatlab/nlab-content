## Idea

The "infinitesimal interval" is an [[infinitesimally thickened point]]/[[infinitesimal disk]] which is a subspace of the [[line object]]. Usually meant is the first order infinitesimal interval, which is the formal dual to the [[ring of dual numbers]].

## Properties

The [[internal hom]]/[[mapping space]] out of the infinitesimal interval is the [[synthetic tangent bundle]]-construction. See there for more.
