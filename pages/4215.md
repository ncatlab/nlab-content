## Idea

A **conjunction** in a [[double category]] is a way of saying that a horizontal arrow and a vertical arrow are [[adjunction|adjoint]], even though they do not live in the same 2-category.

## Definition

Let $f\colon A\to B$ be a vertical arrow and $g\colon B\to A$ a horizontal arrow in a double category.  These arrows are said to be a **conjunction** if they come equipped with 2-cells
$$
\array{ A & \overset{id}{\to} & A \\
^f\downarrow & ^{\eta}\swArrow & \downarrow^{id} \\
B & \underset{g}{\to} & A} 
\qquad and\qquad
\array{ B & \overset{g}{\to} & A \\
^{id} \downarrow & ^{\varepsilon}\swArrow & \downarrow^f \\
B & \underset{id}{\to} & B }
$$
such that $\varepsilon \circ_h \eta = id_g$ and $\eta \circ_v \varepsilon = id_{f}$, where $\circ_h$ and $\circ_v$ denote horizontal and vertical composition of 2-cells.

Given such a conjunction, we say that $f$ and $g$ are **conjoints** of each other, and that $g$ is the **right conjoint** of $f$ and that $f$ is the **left conjoint** of $g$.

## Examples

* In the double category $\mathbf{Sq}(K)$ of squares ("quintets") in any 2-category $K$, a conjunction is simply an internal [[adjunction]] in $K$.

* In the double category $T$-**Alg** of algebras, lax morphisms, and colax morphisms for a [[2-monad]], an conjunction is precisely a [[doctrinal adjunction]] between a colax morphism an a lax morphism.

## Remarks

* The horizontal (or vertical) dual of a conjunction is a [[companion pair]].

* Conjunctions (and companion pairs) have a [[mate]] correspondence generalizing the calculus of mates in 2-categories.

* If every vertical arrow in some double category $D$ has a right conjoint, then the functor $f\mapsto g$ is a [[pseudofunctor]] $V D^{op}\to H D$ from the vertical 2-category to the horizontal one, which is the identity on objects, and locally fully faithful by the mate correspondence.  If every vertical arrow also has a companion, then this makes $D$ into a [[proarrow equipment]], or equivalently a [[framed bicategory]].
