\section{Overview}

The physical existence of the [[Home Page|nLab]] is funded by donations (see [below](#Donate)) which are received via a mechanism handled by the [Topos Institute](https://topos.institute/), with the kind administrative help of [[Brendan Fong]].

The nLab's [[nlabmeta:technical board]] decides about how to use these funds for paying server rent and sysadmin services (see [further below](#Expenditures)).



\section{Donate!}

\section{Available funds}

As of 05 May 2022 the funds available to the nLab due to donations are 

* USD 7280.59 .




\section{Expenditures}
 {#Expenditures}

The above sum is essentially the total sum of donations received so far (just minus USD 95 of cost for a migration experiment which has meanwhile been suspended). 

We need to finally put these funds to use for the following urgent tasks:

1. The most urgent task as of this writing is still to migrate the nLab installation to a new server. The server we have been running on (which had been kindly donated to us) was sunsetted already $\ 2$ years ago, and we had been urged to migrate already then. It looks like we will be offered a new server for free, again (and a million and more thanks are due to the people who make this work), but actually performing the migration to the new server is a non-trivial task. 

   The [[nlabmeta:technical board]] is in contact with an IT company which has experience specifically with the kind of installation that the nLab runs on, and the [[nlabmeta:technical board|board]] plans to hire somebody from this company to help with the migration. The board members estimate that this will cost (the company is in Europe):

   * $\sim$ EUR 4000 .

1. When the migration is done and the physical existence of the nLab is finally secured, then the next task will be to find a volunteer or hired sysadmin who will look after the day-to-day operation of the nLab server (eg. restart the server if crashed, remove spam if any, and maybe even work on little software features if time and inclination permits). 

   Currently the [[nlabmeta:technical board]] members (together with a further volunteer) are *de facto* doing this sysadmin job, but it would be good to have someone dedicated to the task. 

   Maybe we find somebody who would enjoy doing this job on a volunteer basis, as had always been the case since the beginning of the nLab until a few weeks ago. If we don't find a volunteer, then hiring a sysadmin might be at a cost of maybe 

   * $\sim$ USD 300 / month .
