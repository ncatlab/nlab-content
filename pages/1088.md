#Idea#

For $S$ a [[category]] equipped with a [[Grothendieck topology]], i.e. a $S$ [[site]], there is a collection of [[morphism]]s in the [[presheaf]] category $[S^{op}, Set]$ -- called the _local isomorphisms_ -- such that the category $Sh(S)$ of [[sheaf|sheaves]] on $S$ is equivalent to the [[homotopy category]] of $[S^{op}, Set]$  with respect to local isomorphisms as [[category with weak equivalences|weak equivalences]].

WAIT: is this actually right? I need to look up something...

Kashiwara-Schapira don't actually seem to say this, but it is apparently the story that Lurie discusses in section 5.2.7 of [[Higher Topos Theory]]
