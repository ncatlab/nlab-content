## Idea

According to _[[Science of Logic]]_ _pure being_ is the [[unity of opposites|opposite]] of [[nothing]] whose unity is pure [[becoming]]. 


| |  | [[Dasein]] | |  |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| [[becoming]] : | [[nothing]] | $\;\;\;\dashv$ | [[being]] | : [[ceasing]] |

In the formalization of this ([Lawvere 91](#Lawvere91)) this is described by the [[adjoint modality]]

$$
  (\emptyset \dashv \ast)
$$

of the [[idempotent monad]] constant on a [[terminal object]] $\ast$ and its [[left adjoint]] $\emptyset$.

In this interpretation any other [[adjoint modality]] of the form $(\Box \dashv \bigcirc)$ characterizes a more "determinate" form of being ( _Dasein_ in the terminology of ([Hegel 12](#Hegel12))).

A [[category]] equipped with such a notion of being is, naturally, called a _[[category of being]]_.
