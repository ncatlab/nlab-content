## Idea

The _Adams conjecture_ is a statement about triviality of [[spherical fibrations]] associated to certain formal differences of [[vector bundles]] ([[K-theory]] classes) via the [[J-homomorphism]]. The conjecture was stated in ([Adams 63, conjecture 1.2](#Adams63)), for vector bundles of rank up to two over a [[finite CW-complex]] it was proven in ([Adams 63, theorem 1.4](#Adams63)).  A general proof was then given in ([Quillen 71](Quillen71)). 

The Adams conjecture/Adams-Quillen theorem serves a central role in the identification of the [[image of the J-homomorphism]]. 



## Statements

Let $X$ be (the [[homotopy type]] of) a [[topological space]]. For $V \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow B O$ classifying a real [[vector bundle]] on $X$, the corresponding [[spherical fibration]] is classifid by the composite

$$
  J(V)
   \;\colon\;
  X \stackrel{V}{\longrightarrow} B O \stackrel{J}{\longrightarrow} B GL_1(\mathbb{S})
$$

with the delooped [[J-homomorphism]].
This descends to a map from [[topological K-theory]] to [[spherical fibrations]].

Now for $L$ a [[line bundle]] on some $X$ and for non-vanishing $k \in \mathbb{Z}$, [[John Adams]] observed that the [[spherical fibration]] associated with the difference $L^{\otimes k} - L \in K O(X)$ has the property that some $k$-fold multiple of it has trivial spherical fibration, hence that there is $N \in \mathbb{N}$ for which

$$
  J\left(
    \oplus^{k^N} (L^{\otimes k} - L)
  \right)
  = 0
  \,.
$$

Noticing that $L \mapsto L^{\otimes^k} = \Psi^k(L)$ is the $k$th [[Adams operation]] on [[K-theory]] applied to the [[line bundle]] $L$, [[John Adams]] then conjectured that the above is true for all [[vector bundles]] $V$ in the form

$$
  J\left(
    \oplus^{k^N} (\Psi^k(V) - V)
  \right)
  = 0
  \,.
$$
