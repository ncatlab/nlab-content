#Idea#

A _formally smooth scheme_ is a [[scheme]] $X$ with the property that every map into it admits an _[[infinitesimal space|infinitesimal]] perturbation_ :

for any test space $U$ with underlying reduced space $Red(U)$ (obtained from $U$ by removing all [[infinitesimal space|infinitesimal]] directions, compare [[formal scheme]]) every map $Red(U) \to X$ lifts to a map $U \to X$.

#Definition#

A [[scheme]] $X$ over some ground [[field]] $k$, given by a morphism $X \to Spec k$, is **formally smooth** if that morphism is a [[formally smooth morphism]], as described there.

If the [[scheme]] $X$ is regarded as an absoulte scheme, then the morphism $X \to Spec \mathbb{Z}$ is required to be a [[formally smooth morphism]] for $X$ to be formally smooth.
