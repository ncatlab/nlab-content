#Idea#

A _formally smooth scheme_ is a [[scheme]] $X$ with the property that every map into it admits an _[[infinitesimal space|infinitesimal]] lift_ :

for any "test space", i.e. another scheme $U$ with underlying reduced space $Red(U)$ (obtained from $U$ by removing all [[infinitesimal space|infinitesimal]] directions, compare [[formal scheme]]) every map $Red(U) \to X$ lifts to a map $U \to X$.

#Definition#

A [[scheme]] $X$ over some ground [[field]] $k$, given by a morphism $X \to Spec(k)$, is **formally smooth** if that morphism is a [[formally smooth morphism]], as described there.

If the [[scheme]] $X$ is regarded as an absolute (as opposed to relative) scheme, then the morphism $X \to Spec(\mathbb{Z})$ is required to be a [[formally smooth morphism]] for $X$ to be formally smooth.

>(Nowadays people will also start to consider schemes over the [[field with one element]]...).

#Remark#

There is an interpretation of formal smoothness of (set-valued) functors as an [[epipresheaf]] condition with respect to Sasha Rosenberg's generalization of [[Grothendieck topologies]], so-called Q-category formalism, namely the Q-category of nilpotent (infinitesimal) thickenings, cf.
