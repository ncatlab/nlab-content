## Idea

A Hilbert space is a (possibly) infinite-dimensional generalisation of the traditional spaces of Euclidean geometry in which the notions of distance and angle still make good sense.

Hilbert spaces were made famous to the world at large through their applications to [[physics]], where they organise the pure states of quantum systems.
