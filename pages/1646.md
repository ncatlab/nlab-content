## Idea

A _Hilbert space_ is a (possibly) infinite-dimensional generalisation of the traditional spaces of Euclidean geometry in which the notions of distance and angle still make good sense.  This is done through an algebraic operation, the _inner product_, that generalises the dot product.

Hilbert spaces were made famous to the world at large through their applications to [[physics]], where they organise the pure states of quantum systems.


## Definitions

Let $V$ be a [[vector space]] over the field of [[complex number]]s.  (One can generalise the choice of [[field]] somewhat.)  An __inner product__ (in the most general, possibly indefinite, sense) on $V$ is a function
$$ \langle {-},{-} \rangle: V \times V \to \mathbb{C} $$
that is (1--3) _sesquilinear_ and (4) _conjugate-symmetric_ (4); that is:

1.  $ \langle 0, x \rangle = 0 $ and $ \langle x, 0 \rangle = 0 $;
1.  $ \langle x + y, z \rangle = \langle x, z \rangle + \langle y, z \rangle $ and $ \langle x, y + z \rangle = \langle x, y \rangle + \langle x, z \rangle $;
1.  $ \langle c x, y \rangle = \bar{c} \langle x, y \rangle $ and $ \langle x, c y \rangle = c \langle x, y \rangle $;
1.  $ \langle x, y \rangle = \overline{\langle y, x \rangle} $.

Here we use the _physicist\'s convention_ that the inner product is conjugate-linear in the first variable rather than in the second, rather than the _mathematician\'s convention_, which is the reverse.  The physicist\'s convention fits in a little better with $2$-[[2-Hilbert space|Hilbert space]]s.  Note that we use the same field as values of the inner product as for scalars; the complex conjugation will be irrelevant for some choices of field.

The axiom list above is rather redundant.  First of all, (1) follows from (3) by setting $c = 0$; besides that, (1--3) come in pairs, only one of which is needed, since each half follows from the other using (4).  It is even possible to derive (3) from (2) by supposing that $V$ is a [[topological vector space]] and that the inner product is continuous (which, as we will see, is always true anyway for a Hilbert space).

The next concept to define is (semi)definiteness.  We define a function $\|{-}\|^2: V \to \mathbb{C}$ by $\|x\|^2 = \langle x, x \rangle$; in fact, $\|{-}\|^2$ takes only real values, by (4).
*  The inner product is __positive semidefinite__, or simply __positive__, if $\|x\|^2 \geq 0$ always.
*  Notice that (by 1), $\|x\|^2 = 0$ if $x = 0$; the inner product is __definite__ if the converse holds.
*  An inner product is __positive definite__ if it is both positive and definite.
*  As an aside, there are also _negative (semi)definite_ inner products, which are slightly less convenient but not really different.  An inner product is _indefinite_ if some $\|x\|^2$ are positive and some are negative; these have a very different flavour.

The inner product is __complete__ if, given any infinite [[sequence]] $(v_1, v_2, \ldots)$ such that
\[ \label{Cauchy} \lim_{m,n\to\infty} \left\|\sum_{i=m}^{m+n} v_i\right\|^2 = 0 ,\]
there exists a (necessarily unique) **sum** $S$ such that
\[ \label{converge} \lim_{n\to\infty} \left\|S - \sum_{i=1}^n v_i\right\|^2 = 0 .\]
If the inner product is definite, then this sum, if it exists, must be unique, and we write
$$ S = \sum_{i=1}^\infty v_i $$
(with the right-hand side undefined if no such sum exists).

Then a __Hilbert space__ is simply a vector space equipped with a complete positive definite inner product.


### Hilbert spaces as Banach spaces

If an inner product is positive, then we can take the principal square root of $\|x\|^2 = \langle x, x \rangle$ to get the a real number $\|x\|$, the __norm__ of $x$.

This norm satisfies all of the requirements of a [[Banach space]].  It additionally satisfies the _parallelogram law_
$$ \|x + y\|^2 + \|x - y\|^2 = 2 \|x\|^2 + 2 \|y\|^2 ,$$
which not all Banach spaces need satisfy.  (The name of this law comes from its geometric interpretation: the norms in the left-hand side are the lengths of the diagonals of a parallelogram, while the norms in the right-hand side are the lengths of the sides.)

Furthermore, any Banach space satsifying the parallelogram law has a unique inner product that reproduces the norm, defined by
$$ \langle x, y \rangle = \frac{1}{4} (\|x + y\|^2 - \|x - y\|^2 - \mathrm{i} \|x + \mathrm{i}y\|^2 + \mathrm{i} \|x - \mathrm{i}y\|^2) ,$$
or &frac12;$(\|x + y\|^2 - \|x - y\|^2)$ in the real case.

Therefore, it is possible to *define* a Hilbert space as a Banach space that satisfies the parallelogram law.  This actually works a bit more generally; a positive semidefinite inner product space is a pseudonormed vector space that satisfies the parallelogram law.  (We cannot, however, recover an indefinite inner product from a norm.)


### Hilbert spaces as metric spaces

In any positive semidefinite inner product space, let the __distance__ $d(x,y)$ be
$$ d(x,y) = \|y - x\| .$$
Then $d$ is a [[psuedometric]]; it is a complete metric if and only if we have a Hilbert space.

In fact, the axioms of a [[Banach space]] (or pseudonormed vector space) can be written entirely in terms of the metric; we can also state the parallelogram law as follows:
$$ d(x,y)^2 + d(x,-y)^2 = 2 d(x,0)^2 + 2 d(x,x+y)^2 .$$

In definitions, it is probably most common to see the metric introduced only to state the completeness requirement.  Indeed, (eq:Cauchy) says that the sequence of partial sums is a [[Cauchy sequence]], while (eq:converge) says that the sequence of partial sums converges to $S$.


### Hilbert spaces as conformal spaces

Given two vectors $x$ and $y$, both nonzero, let the __angle__ between them be the angle $\theta(x,y)$ whose cosine is
$$ \cos \theta(x,y) = \frac { \langle x, y \rangle } { \|x\| \|y\| } .$$
(Note that this angle may be imaginary in general, but not for a Hilbert space over $\mathbb{R}$.)

A Hilbert space cannot be reconstructed entirely from its angles, however (even given the underlying vector space).  The inner product can only be recovered up to a positive scale factor.

## Examples

$\mathbb{C}^n$, $l^2$, $L^2(\mathbb{R})$, etc.  Basically the examples at [[Banach space]] for $p = 2$. 

A basic result is that abstractly, Hilbert spaces are all of the same type: every (say complex) Hilbert space $H$ admits an orthonormal basis, meaning a subset $S \subseteq H$ which extends uniquely to an isomorphism 

$$l^2(S) \to H$$

of Hilbert spaces. Here $l^2(S)$ is the completion of the complex inner product space $V$ where the underlying vector space consists of formal $\mathbb{C}$-linear combinations of elements of $S$, and where the inner product on $V$ is uniquely determined by the rule 

$$\langle u, v \rangle = \delta_{u v} \qquad u, v \in S$$ 

in which $\delta_{u v}$ denotes Kronecker delta. 

This basic result uses the [[axiom of choice]] (in the form of [[Zorn's lemma]]) in its proof, and is equivalent to it. 
In particular, all infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert spaces are abstractly isomorphic to $l^2(\mathbb{N})$. 

On the other hand, orthonormal bases for particular Hilbert spaces can often be produced constructively, using [[approximation of the identity]] techniques, often in concert with a [[Gram-Schmidt process]]. 

## Morphisms of Hilbert spaces

See discussion at [[Banach space]].  There is more to be said here concerning duals (including why the theory of Hilbert spaces is slightly nicer over $\mathbb{C}$ while that of Banach spaces is slightly nicer over $\mathbb{R}$).

## Cauchy--Schwartz

The _Schwartz inequality_ is very handy:
$$ |\langle x, y \rangle| \leq \|x\| \|y\| .$$
