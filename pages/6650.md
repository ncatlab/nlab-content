An [[orthogonal factorization system]] $(E,M)$ on a [[category]] $C$ with [[pullbacks]] is called **stable** if $E$ is [[stability under pullback|stable under pullback]].

For a general (orthogonal) factorization system $(E,M)$, the factorizations show that the full inclusion $M/x \to C/x$ (where $M/x$ consists of morphisms in $M$ with [[target]] $x$) has a left adjoint.  The factorization system is stable if and only if these left adjoints form an [[indexed functor]] --- that is, they commute with the pullback functors $f^* \colon C/y \to C/x$.

A [[reflective factorization system]] on a finitely complete category is stable if and only if its corresponding [[reflector]] preserves finite limits.  A stable reflective factorization system is sometimes called **local**.
