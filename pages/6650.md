## Definition

An [[orthogonal factorization system]] $(E,M)$ on a [[category]] $C$ with [[pullbacks]] is called **stable** if $E$ is [[stability under pullback|stable under pullback]].

## Properties

### In terms of indexed left adjoints
 {#InTermsOfIndexedLeftAdjoints}

For a general (orthogonal) factorization system $(E,M)$, the factorizations show that for all [[objects]] the [[full subcategory|full inclusion]] $M/x \to C/x$ (where $M/x$ consists of morphisms in $M$ with [[target]] $x$) has a 
[[left adjoint]], hence is a [[reflective subcategory]].  

The factorization system is stable if and only if these left adjoints form an [[indexed functor]] --- that is, they commute with the [[base change|pullback functors]] $f^* \colon C/y \to C/x$.

### Stable reflective factorization systems
 {#StableReflectiveFactorizationSystems}

A [[reflective factorization system]] on a finitely [[complete category]] is stable if and only if its corresponding [[reflector]] preserves [[finite limits]] (is a [[left exact functor]]).  

The analogous statement also holds in [[(∞,1)-category theory]], or rather at least in [[locally cartesian closed (∞,1)-categories]]. A discussion of this and formal proof in terms of [[homotopy type theory]] is in ([Shulman](#Shulman)).

A stable reflective factorization system is sometimes called **local**.


## Examples

* In an a [[topos]], [[epimorphism]] are stable under [[pullback]] and hence the [[(epi, mono) factorization system]] in a topos is stable.

  More generally, in an [[(∞,1)-topos]] for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the [[(n-epi, n-mono) factorization system]] (see there for more details) is a stable [[orthogonal factorization system in an (∞,1)-category]].
