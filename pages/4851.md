Given [[strict 2-categories]], $A$ and $C$, and strict 2-functors $F:A\to C$ and $U:C\to A$, a __strict 2-adjunction__ is given one of the following two equivalent means:

* an isomorphism of categories $C(F a,c)\cong A(a,U c)$ for each object $a$ in $A$ and object $c$ in $C$, which is strict 2-natural both in $a$ and in $c$;

* a strict 2-natural 2-transformations of 2-functors unit $\eta : Id_A \to U F$, and counit $\epsilon : F U\to Id_B$, satisfying the triangle identities strictly.  Note that this is an ordinary [[adjunction]] [[internalization|internal]] to the [[2-category]] $2Cat$ of [[Cat]]-[[enriched categories]], strict 2-functors, and strict 2-natural transformations.

There are also more relaxed forms of 2-adjunction, involving weak 2-categories, weak 2-functors, and/or weak 2-natural transformations; see [[2-adjunction]].
