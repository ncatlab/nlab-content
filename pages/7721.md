## Idea

_Type II geometry_ is to [[Riemannian geometry]] as [[generalized complex geometry]] is to [[complex geometry]].

Where the latter is the [[geometry]] induced by [[reduction of the structure group]] of the [[generalized tangent bundle]] of an even dimensional [[manifold]] along the inclusion $U(d,d) \to O(2d,2d)$ of the indefinite [[unitary group]] into the orthogonal group, type II geometry is the geometry induced by reduction along the inclusion of [[orthogonal group|orthogonal groups]]

$$
  O(n) \times O(n) \to O(n,n)
  \,.
$$


This notion takes its name from the fact that it describes a good bit of the geometry of [[type II supergravity]].
