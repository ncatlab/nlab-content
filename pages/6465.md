## Idea

An MV-algebra  is an algebraic structure which models Luzasiewicz multivalued logic, and  the fragment of that calculus which deals with the basic logical connectives "and", "or", and "not", but in a multivalued context.


## Definitions

An MV-algebra consists of

* a non-empty set, $A$;

* a binary operation, $\oplus$, on $A$;

* a unary operation, $\neg$, on $A$; and a constant, $0$, such that


1. $\langle A, \oplus,\neg\rangle$ is a commutative [[monoid]];

1. $\neg\neg x =  x$ for all $x \in A$;

1. $x\oplus \neg 0 = \neg 0$ for all $x\in A$; and 

1. $\neg(\neg x\oplus y)\oplus y = \neg(\neg y\oplus x)\oplus x$ for all $x, y$ in $A$.



The last axiom is more difficult to interpret but is clarified by some examples.

###### Example

Let $A = [0,1]$ be the unit interval.  Define

$$x\oplus y = min(1,x+y)$$

$$\neg x = 1-x.$$

This gives a commutative monoid easily enough and the double negation and absorption axioms are easy to check. Finally the last axiom divides into two cases: $x \lt y$ and $y \lt x$ and only one of these needs checking!

###### Example 

Any [[Boolean algebra]] defines a MV-algebra with $\oplus = \vee$, and $\neg$ being the complement operation. The expressions in the last axiom evaluate to $x\vee y$.
