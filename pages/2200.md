A __boolean-valued function__ is a function of type $f : X \to \mathbb{B}$, where $X$ is an arbitrary set and where $\mathbb{B}$ is a [[boolean domain]].

In some contexts a boolean-valued function may be referred to as a _[[predicate]]_ or a _[[proposition]]_.  In other contexts these terms may be used to describe the syntactic entities that denote or express boolean-valued functions, or that have boolean-valued functions among their canonical or intended models.  When necessary to avoid confusion, terms like _predicate formula_ or _propositional expression_ may be used to distinguish signs from their objects.

Assuming the law of [[excluded middle]], the boolean-valued functions on $X$ correpond precisely to the [[subsets]] of $X$; even in [[constructive mathematics]], they corresond to the [[decidable subsets]] of $X$.  See also [[characteristic function]].
