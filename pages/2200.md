A __boolean-valued function__ is a [[function]] from any [[set]] to the [[boolean domain]] $\{\bot, \top\}$.

In [[classical logic]], the definable boolean-valued functions on a [[type]] $X$ correspond precisely to [[predicates]] on $X$.  Assuming the law of [[excluded middle]], the boolean-valued functions on $X$ correspond precisely to the [[subsets]] of $X$; even in [[constructive mathematics]], they corresond to the [[decidable subsets]] of $X$.
