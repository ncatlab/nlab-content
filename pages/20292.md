## Statement

Recall that a [[topological space]] $X$ is [[metacompact space|metacompact]] if every open cover has a point-finite open refinement which covers $X$. Further a space is called [[Lindelöf topological space|Lindelöf]] if every [[open cover]] has a [[countable cover|countable]] sub-cover. 

\begin{theorem}
Assuming the law of [[excluded middle]]:

Every [[separable space|separable]] metacompact [[topological space]] $X$ is Lindelöf .
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof goes by contradiction: Assume there is an open cover $\{U_i\}_{i\in I}$ with no countable subcover. Let $\{U_j\}_{j\in J}$ be a point finite refinement. Let $D\subset $ be a countable dense set. Then $\{U_j\}_{j\in J}$ is uncountable and so some point $x \in D$ is in $U_j$ for infinetly (even uncountably) many $j \in J$.
\end{proof}
