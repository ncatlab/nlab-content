Let $p\colon E\to B$ be a [[Grothendieck fibration|fibered category]]. A **cleavage** of $p$ is a choice of a single cartesian arrow $f:e'\to e$ with prescribed codomain $e\in E$ and prescribed projection $p(f) = u$ in $B$. 

If we assume the axiom of choice then every fibered category has a cleavage. Given a cleavage of $p$ and an arrow $u:b'\to b$ in $B$ there is a functor $u^*\colon p^{-1}(b)\to p^{-1}(b')$ which to every object $e\in p^{-1}(b)$ assigns the domain of the unique arrow in the cleavage which is above $u$ and whose codomain is $e$. This correspondence extends to covariant functor thanks to the universal property of the cartesian arrows. (...) Functor $u^*$ is the *direct image functor* of $u$ and to the choice of cleavage. The direct image functors corresponding to varying morphisms in $B$ together form a pseudofunctor.
