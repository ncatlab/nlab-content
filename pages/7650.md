Given a (Hausdorff) [[topological group]] $G$, the __Milnor construction of universal principal $G$-bundles__ (also known as the Milnor's join construction) constructs the infinite join of copies of $G$, 
i.e. the colimit of [[join]]s
$$
(E G)_{Milnor} := colim G \ast G \ast \ldots \ast G
$$
and canonically equipps with a continuous free right action of $G$ which permits a structure of a CW-complex such that the action of $G$ permutes its  cells. Consequently, the natural projection $(E G)_{Milnor}\to (E G)_{Milnor}/G$ is a model for the universal bundle $E G\to B G$ of locally trivial principal $G$-bundles over [[paracompact space|paracompact]] Hausdorff spaces, or equivalently, of numerable principal $G$-bundles over all [[Hausdorff topological space]]s.
