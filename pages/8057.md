## Idea 

In [[combinatory logic]], or in the pure or untyped [[lambda-calculus]], a fixed-point combinator is a term $Y$ which, when applied to any term $n$, yields a term $Y n$ that is a fixed-point: $n(Y n) = Y n$. 

## Construction 

There are many ways of constructing a fixed-point combinator. A traditional construction, as formulated in the lambda-calculus, is 

$$Y = \lambda n. (\lambda s. n(s s))(\lambda s. n(s s))$$ 

For a given term $n$, put $t = \lambda s. n(s s)$. We then have $Y n = t t$, and we also have 

$$\array{
Y n & = & (\lambda s. n(s s))(\lambda s. n(s s)) \\
 & = & (\lambda s. n(s s))(t) \\ 
 & = & n(t t) \\ 
 & = & n(Y n)
}$$ 

so that $Y n$ is a fixed point of $n$. Compare Lawvere's proof of [[Cantor's theorem]]. 

In combinatory logic (based on combinators $S$, $K$, $I$), one construction is  

$$Y = S (K (S I I)) (S (S (K S) K) (K (S I I)))$$ 

following the standard formulas $S x y z = (x z)(y z)$, $K x y = x$ and $I x = x$, and where bracketings left unspecified are by convention to the left. (To be expanded...)
