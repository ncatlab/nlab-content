## Idea

Additive analytic geometry over the complex number is an analog of complex analytic geometry obtained by replacing the convolution algebra $\ell^1(\N,\C)$ of converging power series of radius $1$ (discrete Mellin transforms) by the algebra $L^1(\R_+,\C)$ of integrable functions (continuous Mellin transforms).
The analog of the complex unit disc $D(0,1)$ is the hyperbolic/additive unit disc $D(-\infty,0)$. The main interest of this new geometry is that it allows the spectral study of the zeroes of automorphic $L$-functions in a geometric context.

One needs to use Dirac measures to relate directly these two types of geometries,
by the relation on coordinates given by $z=e^s$ in an archimedean context, and $z=p^{-s}$ in a non-archimedean context.

Additive analytic geometry also has a non-commutative and automorphic extension, that may be useful to study and formulate some problems of automorphic representation theory in a geometric context.

## To be developped

It is easy to paste two additive unit discs along their boundary $\R$,
that is the spectrum of $L^1(\R)$, to get $\mathbb{P}^1(\C)$.
