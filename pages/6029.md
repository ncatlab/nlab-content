## Idea

The field of [[quantum field theory]] started out as a description of the [[fundamental particle]]s that are observed in experiment, such as [[electron]]s and [[photon]]s.

However, even so, abstractly the formalization of the concept of _particle_ within [[QFT]]s is somewhat subtle.

If the quantum field theory is on [[Minkowski space]] and comes with a [[Hilbert space|Hilbert]] [[space of states]] on which thus the  [[Poincare group]] of translations, rotations and boosts in Minkowski space acts, the massive _particle_ excitations of the theory can be found in the discrete spectrum of the time translation operator as the [[irreducible representation|irreducible]] [[unitary representations of the Poincare group]].

For QFTs on [[curved]] [[spacetimes]] the situation is more subtle.

Often, however, QFTs are considered as [[quantization]]s of given [[Lagrangian]]s. In these cases one often identifies their particle content with that explicitly encoded by the Lagrangian. Notably when that ariseses from [[second quantization]] of some 1-dimensional [[sigma-model]], the particles of the theory are those described by these sigma-models.
