In the terminology of [[Nikolai Durov]], a __generalized ring__ is a commutative [[algebraic monad]], where commutativity of an algebraic monad is a nontrivial notion introduced in his thesis (but limitedly known before). 

Durov introduced [[spectrum (geometry)|spectra]] of generalized rings, generalizing the Grothendieck prime spectrum. This enabled him to develop _generalized algebraic geometry_, a single framework whose special cases include versions of tropical geometry, Arakelov geometry and absolute geometry over $F_1$. The categories of [[quasicoherent sheaf|quasicoherent sheaves]] in that setup are not necessarily [[abelian category|abelian]]; for that reason, Durov develops a version of homotopical algebra in a [[topos]], to be able to replace usual homological algebra for abelian sheaves with nonabelian derived functors following Quillen. In his version of homotopical algebra, model categories are however replaced by pseudomodel stacks. The ultimate goal is to set a natural framework for a statement and a proof of arithmetic Riemann-Roch theorem of Bismut-Gillet-Soulé, and Faltings in a manner parallel to Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem.
