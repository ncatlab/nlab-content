**Data** are [[values]] of [[qualitative]] or [[quantitative]] [[variable]]s, belonging to a set of items. Data in [[computing]] (or [[data processing]]) are represented in a [[structure]], often [[tabular]] (represented by [[rows]] and [[columns]]), a [[tree]] (a [[set]] of [[nodes]] with [[parent]]-[[children]] [[relation|relationship]] or a [[graph]] structure (a set of [[interconnected]] nodes). Data are typically the [[result]]s of [[measurement]]s and can be [[visualised]] using [[graph]]s or [[image]]s. 

Data as an [[abstract]] [[concept]] can be viewed as the lowest level of [[abstraction]] from which [[information]] and then [[knowledge]] are derived.
