## Definition

Given a [[field]] $k$, the [[category]] **$Vect_k$** is [[category]] whose [[object|objects]] are [[vector space]]s and whose [[morphism]]s are [[linear map]]s.   

If the field $k$ is understood, one often just writes $Vect$.

The study of $Vect$ is called [[linear algebra]].

## Related categories

The [[full subcategory]] of Vect consisting of [[finite-dimensional vector spaces]] is denoted **$\Fin Vect$**.

This is a [[compact closed category]] (see [here](finite-dimensional+vector+space#CompactClosure)).

$\Fin Vect$ is where most of ordinary [[linear algebra]] lives, although much of it makes sense in all of $Vect$.  See also at _[[finite quantum mechanics in terms of dagger-compact categories]]_.
 

On the other hand, anything involving transposes or [[inner products]] really takes place in $Fin$ [[Hilb]].
