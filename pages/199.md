[[!redirects FinVect]]

**$Vect$** is the [[category]] whose [[object|objects]] are [[vector space|vector spaces]] and whose [[morphism|morphisms]] are linear operators.  This definition implicitly presumes that we are considering vector spaces over a fixed [[field]] $k$.  To make the dependence on the field explicit, we may write $Vect_k$ or $k \Vect$.  

The [[full subcategory]] of Vect consisting of finite-dimensional vector spaces is denoted **$\Fin Vect$**, which is a [[dagger compact category]].

$\Fin Vect$ is where ordinary linear algebra lives, although much of it makes sense in all of $Vect$.
