## Definition

Given a [[field]] $k$, the _category of $k$-vector spaces_ **$Vect_k$**  is the [[category]] whose

1. [[object|objects]] are [[vector space]],

1. [[morphisms]] are [[linear maps]].

If the field $k$ is understood, one often just writes $Vect$.

Via [[direct sum]] and [[tensor product of vector spaces]] $\otimes_k$, this becomes a [[symmetric monoidal category]] in two compatible ways, making it a [[distributive monoidal category]], in particular a [[rig category]].

The study of $Vect$ is called _[[linear algebra]]_.



## Related categories

### Finite-dimensional vector spaces

The [[full subcategory]] of Vect consisting of [[finite-dimensional vector spaces]] is denoted **$\Fin Vect$**.

This is a [[compact closed category]] (see [here](finite-dimensional+vector+space#CompactClosure)).

$\Fin Vect$ is where most of ordinary [[linear algebra]] lives, although much of it makes sense in all of $Vect$.  See also at _[[finite quantum mechanics in terms of dagger-compact categories]]_.
 
On the other hand, anything involving transposes or [[inner products]] really takes place in $Fin$ [[Hilb]].

### Modules

More generally, for $R$ any [[ring]] (not necessarily a [[field]]) then the analog of $Vect$ is the category $R$[[Mod]] of $R$-[[modules]] and module homomorphisms between them.


### Vector bundles 

For $X$ a suitable [[space]] of sorts, there is the category [[Vect(X)]] of [[vector bundles]] over $X$. Specifically for $X$ a [[topological space]], there is the category of [[topological vector bundles]] over $X$. For $X = \ast$ the [[point space]], then this is [[equivalence of categories|equivalently]] the category of plain vector spaces:

$$
  Vect(\ast) \simeq Vect
  \,.
$$
