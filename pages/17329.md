## Introduction

We give a proof that [[groupoid | groupoids]] model [[homotopy 1-type | homotopy 1-types]]. More precisely, we construct a Quillen equivalence between a model structure on the category of groupoids, and a certain model structure on the category of cubical sets.

###### Notation

We denote by $\square_{\leq 1}$ the category defined uniquely (up to isomorphism) by the following.

1) There are exactly two objects, which we shall denote by $I^{0}$ and $I^{1}$.

2) There are exactly two arrows $i_{0}, i_{1} : I^{0} \rightarrow I^{1}$.

3) There is exactly one arrow $p : I^{1} \rightarrow I^{0}$.

4) There are no other non-identity arrows.

###### Notation

We denote by $\Pi : \square_{\leq 1} \rightarrow \mathsf{Grpd}$ the functor determined uniquely by the following.

1) We define $\Pi_{\leq 1}(I^{0})$ to be the unique (up to isomorphism) groupoid with a single object and a single arrow. We can also describe $\Pi_{\leq 1}(I^{0})$ as the free groupoid on the directed graph with the same description.

2) We define $\Pi_{\leq 1}(I^{1})$ to be the groupoid determined uniquely (up to isomorphism) by the following.

a) There are exactly two objects, which we shall denote by $0$ and $1$.

b) There is exactly one arrow $i : 0 \rightarrow 1$.

c) There is exactly one arrow $i^{-1} : 1 \rightarrow 0$.

d) There are no other non-identity arrows.

We can also describe $\Pi_{\leq 1}(I^{1})$ as the free groupoid on the directed graph described by a) and b). 

3) We define $\Pi_{\leq 1}(i_{0})$ to be the functor determined uniquely by sending the single object of $\Pi_{\leq 1}(I^{0})$ to the object $0$ of $\Pi_{\leq 1}(I^{1})$.

4) We define $\Pi_{\leq 1}(i_{1})$ to be the functor determined uniquely by sending the single object of $\Pi_{\leq 1}(I^{1})$ to the object $1$ of $\Pi_{\leq 1}(I^{1})$.
