## Introduction

We give a proof that [[groupoid | groupoids]] model [[homotopy 1-type | homotopy 1-types]]. More precisely, we construct a Quillen equivalence between a model structure on the category of groupoids, and a certain model structure on the category of cubical sets.

###### Notation

We denote by $\square_{\leq 1}$ the category defined uniquely (up to isomorphism) by the following.

1) There are exactly two objects, which we shall denote by $I^{0}$ and $I^{1}$.

2) There are exactly two arrows $i_{0}, i_{1} : I^{0} \rightarrow I^{1}$.

3) There is exactly one arrow $p : I^{1} \rightarrow I^{0}$.

4) There are no other non-identity arrows.

In particular, the diagram

## Fundamental groupoid adjunction

We give two constructions. The first is quickest, but it seems necessary to have a more explicit description of the fundamental groupoid functor $\Pi$ for the purposes of giving a proof, of the kind we shall give, of the homotopy hypothesis for 1-types. For this, the second approach is more useful.

### Approach 1

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Notation

We denote by $\Pi : \square_{\leq 1} \rightarrow \mathsf{Grpd}$ the functor determined uniquely by the following.

1) We define $\Pi_{\leq 1}(I^{0})$ to be the unique (up to isomorphism) groupoid with a single object and a single arrow. We can also describe $\Pi_{\leq 1}(I^{0})$ as the free groupoid on the directed graph with the same description.

2) We define $\Pi_{\leq 1}(I^{1})$ to be the groupoid determined uniquely (up to isomorphism) by the following.

a) There are exactly two objects, which we shall denote by $0$ and $1$.

b) There is exactly one arrow $i : 0 \rightarrow 1$.

c) There is exactly one arrow $i^{-1} : 1 \rightarrow 0$.

d) There are no other non-identity arrows.

We can also describe $\Pi_{\leq 1}(I^{1})$ as the free groupoid on the directed graph described by a) and b). 

3) We define $\Pi_{\leq 1}(i_{0})$ to be the functor determined uniquely by sending the single object of $\Pi_{\leq 1}(I^{0})$ to the object $0$ of $\Pi_{\leq 1}(I^{1})$.

4) We define $\Pi_{\leq 1}(i_{1})$ to be the functor determined uniquely by sending the single object of $\Pi_{\leq 1}(I^{1})$ to the object $1$ of $\Pi_{\leq 1}(I^{1})$.

5) We define $\Pi_{\leq 1}(p)$ to be the unique functor from $\Pi_{\leq 1}(I^{1})$ to $\Pi_{\leq 1}(I^{0})$.

Making use of the cartesian monoidal structure upon $\mathsf{Grpd}$, we denote by $\Pi : \square \rightarrow \mathsf{Grpd}$ the canonical functor determined, by means of the universal property of $\square$ as the free strict monoidal category on $\square_{\leq 1}$, by the functor $\Pi_{\leq 1}$.

###### Notation

Appealing to the fact that $\mathsf{Grpd}$ is co-complete, we also denote by $\Pi_{\leq 2} : \mathsf{Set}^{\square_{\leq 2}^{op}} \rightarrow \mathsf{Grpd}$ the canonical functor determined, by the universal property of $\mathsf{Set}^{\square_{\leq 2}^{op}}$ as the free co-completion of $\square_{\leq 2}$, by the functor $\Pi_{\leq 2} : \square_{\leq 2} \rightarrow \mathsf{Grpd}$ of Notation \ref{NotationPi2TruncatedCategoryOfCubes}.

###### Notation

By the usual argument discussed at [[nerve and realization | nerve and realisation]], the functor $\Pi_{\leq 2} : \mathsf{Set}^{\square_{\leq 2}^{op}} \rightarrow \mathsf{Grpd}$ admits a right adjoint, which we shall denote by $N_{\leq 2} : \mathsf{Grpd} \rightarrow  \mathsf{Set}^{\square_{\leq 2}^{op}}$.

### Approach 2

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Notation

We denote by $\mathsf{FreeGroupoid} : \mathsf{Set}^{\square_{\leq 1}} \rightarrow \mathsf{Set}^{\square_{\leq 1}}$ the functor defined as follows.

1) To a 1-truncated cubical $X$, we associate the 1-truncated cubical set $X$ defined as follows.

a) Its set of 0-cubes is the same as that of $X$. 

b) Its set of 1-cubes is the set of zig-zags of 1-cubes of $X$ up to the notion of equivalence defined below, where by a zig-zag of 1-cubes of $X$ we mean, for some integer $n \geq 0$, a set of 1-cubes of $X$ whose faces match up as follows. 

$$
   \array{
      x_{0}  &  \overset{f_{1}}{\rightarrow} & x_{1} \overset{g_{1}}{\leftarrow} & x_{2} & \cdots & x_{2n-2} & \overset{f_{n}}{\rightarrow} & x_{2n-1} \overset{g_{n}}{\leftarrow} & x_{2n}
   }
$$

We identify a pair of zig-zags if one can be obtained from the other by a sequence of the following manipulations: we may remove or add a pair of arrows of the form 

$$
   \array{
      x_{0}  &  \overset{f}{\rightarrow} & x_{1} \overset{f}{\leftarrow} & x_{0} 
   }
$$

or of the following form.

$$
   \array{
      x_{0}  &  \overset{f}{\leftarrow} & x_{1} \overset{f}{\rightarrow} & x_{0} 
   }
$$

c) The faces of a zig-zag as above are $x_{0}$ and $x_{2n}$.

d) Its degenerate 1-cubes are those zig-zags for which $n = 0$.

2) To a morphism of 1-truncated cubical sets $F : X \rightarrow Y$, we associate the morphism of 1-truncated cubical sets defined as follows.

a) On 0-cubes, it is the same as $f$.

b) To a zig-zag as follows 

$$
   \array{
      x_{0}  &  \overset{f_{1}}{\rightarrow} & x_{1} \overset{g_{1}}{\leftarrow} & x_{2} & \cdots & x_{2n-2} & \overset{f_{n}}{\rightarrow} & x_{2n-1} \overset{g_{n}}{\leftarrow} & x_{2n}
   }
$$

we associate the following zig-zag. 

$$
   \array{
      F(x_{0}) &  \overset{F(f_{1})}{\rightarrow} & F(x_{1}) \overset{F(g_{1})}{\leftarrow} & F(x_{2}) & \cdots & F(x_{2n-2}) & \overset{F(f_{n})}{\rightarrow} & F(x_{2n-1}) \overset{F(g_{n})}{\leftarrow} & F(x_{2n})
   }
$$

###### Observation

The following equips $\mathsf{FreeGroupoid} : \mathsf{Set}^{\square_{\leq 1}} \rightarrow \mathsf{Set}^{\square_{\leq 1}}$ with the structure of a monad.

a) The natural transformation $\mathsf{FreeGroupoid}^{2} \rightarrow \mathsf{FreeGroupoid}$ is the identity on 0-cubes, and takes a zig-zag of zig-zags 

$$
   \array{
      x_{0}  &  \overset{y_{1}}{\rightarrow} & x_{1} \overset{z_{1}}{\leftarrow} & x_{2} & \cdots & x_{2n-2} & \overset{y_{n}}{\rightarrow} & x_{2n-1} \overset{z_{n}}{\leftarrow} & x_{2n}
   }
$$

to the zig-zag obtained by 'unfolding' the zig-zags $y_{1}$, $z_{1}$, $\ldots$, $y_{n}$, $z_{n}$ into the above zig-zag.

b) The natural transformation $\mathsf{id} \rightarrow \mathsf{FreeGroupoid}$ is the identity on 0-cubes, and sends a 1-cube $f : x_{0} \rightarrow x_{1}$ to the following zig-zag, where the right arrow is the degenerate 1-cube on $x_{1}$.

$$
   \array{
      x_{0}  &  \overset{f}{\rightarrow} & x_{1} \leftarrow & x_{1} 
   }
$$

###### Remark

The category of groupoids is equivalent to the Eilenberg-Moore category of the monad of Observation \ref{ObservationFreeGroupoidMonad}. We shall, however, not make use of this, and simply take, in this approach, the _definition_ of $\mathsf{Grpd}$ to be the Eilenberg-Moore category of this monad.
