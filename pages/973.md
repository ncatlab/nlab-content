## Definition

A **sketch** is a [[small category]] with specified [[limit]]s and [[colimit]]s.

A **model of a sketch** is a [[Set]]-valued [[functor]] preserving the specified limits and colimits.

A [[category]] is called **sketchable** if it is the category of models of a sketch.

The categories of models of sketches are precisely the [[accessible category|accessible categories]].

A **limit-sketch** is a sketch with just limits and no colimits specified.

The categories of models of limit-sketches are the [[locally presentable category|locally presentable categories]].

* an *accessible* category is equivalently:
  * a full subcategory of a presheaf category that's closed under $\kappa$-filtered colimits for some $\kappa$
  * the category of models of a sketch

* a *locally presentable* category is equivalently:
  * a *reflective* full subcategory of a presheaf category that's closed under $\kappa$-filtered colimits for some $\kappa$
  * the category of models of a *limit* sketch
  * an accessible category with all small limits
  * an accessible category with all small colimits

we can "break in half" the difference between the two and define

* a *locally multipresentable category* to be equivalently:
  * a *multireflective* full subcategory of a presheaf category that's closed under $\kappa$-filtered colimits for some $\kappa$
  * the category of models of a *limit and coproduct* sketch
  * an accessible category with all small *connected* limits
  * an accessible category with all small multicolimits

and

* a *weakly locally presentable category* to be equivalently:
  * a *weakly reflective* full subcategory of a presheaf category that's closed under $\kappa$-filtered colimits for some $\kappa$
  * the category of models of a *limit and epi* sketch
  * an accessible category with all small products
  * an accessible category with all small weak colimits
