## Definition

A **sketch** is a [[small category]] with specified [[limit]]s and [[colimit]]s.

A **model of a sketch** is a [[Set]]-valued [[functor]] preserving the specified limits and colimits.

A [[category]] is called **sketchable** if it is the category of models of a sketch.

The categories of models of sketches are precisely the [[accessible category|accessible categories]].

A **limit-sketch** is a sketch with just limits and no colimits specified.

The categories of models of limit-sketches are the [[locally presentable category|locally presentable categories]].
