## Idea

In [[smooth infinity-groupoid|higher differential geometry]] the notion of [[connection on a bundle]] and in particular that of [[circle bundle]] [[connection on a bundle|with connection]] is refined to a tower of notions of [[circle n-bundles with connection]] for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. In particular also the degenerate case of $n = 0$ is defined and fits into this tower: a [[0-bundle]] is simply a [[function]] with values in the given structure group (e.g. the [[circle group]] $U(1)$).

Moreover, for a [[prequantum field theory]] defined by an [[extended Lagrangian]] there is such a [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle (n-k)-bundle with connection]] for each [[closed manifold]] of [[dimension]] $k$, called the [[prequantum n-bundle|prequantum (n-k)-bundle]]. For $n = k$ this is the [[action functional]] of the theory. Hence the action functional may be thought of as the **prequantum 0-bundle** of an [[extended prequantum field theory]].
