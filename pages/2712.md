## Idea

The Reshetikhin-Turaev construction is the [[FQFT]] construction of a 3d [[TQFT]] from the data of  a [[modular tensor category]] $\mathcal{C}$. It is something like the "square root" of the [[Turaev-Viro construction]] on $\mathcal{C}$.

In the case that $C$ is a category of 
[[positive energy representation]]s of a [[loop group]] $\Omega G$ of a [[Lie group]] $G$, then this algebraically defined QFT is thought to be the result of [[quantization]] of [[Chern-Simons theory]] over the group $G$. 

## Properties

The RT-construction for group $G$ is expected to be the [[FQFT]] of $G$-[[Chern-Simons theory]], though a fully explicit proof of this via [[quantization]] is currently not in the literature. See at _[TQFT from compact Lie groups -- 3d Chern-Simons as a fully extended TQFT](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Topological+Quantum+Field+Theories+from+Compact+Lie+Groups#3dCSFullyExtended)_.

The [[CFT|Fuchs-Runkel-Schweigert-construction]] builds from the RT-construction explicitly the rational 2-dimensional [[CFT]] boundary theory (see at _[[holographic principle]]_).
