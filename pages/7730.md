__$n$-angulated categories__ are a generalization to integers $n\geq 3$ of a [[triangulated category]], which is obtained for $n = 3$. They are introduced in

Its abstract reads: 

> We define $n$-angulated categories by modifying the axioms of triangulated categories in a natural way. We show that Heller's parametrization of pre-triangulations extends to pre-$n$-angulations. We obtain a large class of examples of $n$-angulated categories by considering $(n-2)$-cluster tilting subcategories of triangulated categories which are stable under the $(n-2)$nd power of the suspension functor. As an application, we show how $n$-angulated Calabi-Yau categories yield triangulated Calabi-Yau categories of higher Calabi-Yau dimension. Finally, we sketch a link to algebraic geometry and string theory.
