## Idea

The _one-point compactification_ of a [[topological space]] $X$ is a new [[compact space]] $X^+ = X \cup \{\infty\}$ obtained by adding a single new point "$\infty$" to the original space and declaring in $X^+$ the [[complements]] of the original [[closed subspace|closed]] [[compact space|compact]] [[subspaces]] to be [[open subspace|open]].

One may think of the new point added as the "point at infinity" of the original space. A [[continuous function]] on $X$ _[[vanishing at infinity|vanishes at infinity]]_ precisely if it extends to a continuous function on $X^+$ and literally takes the value zero at the point "$\infty$".

This one-point compactification is also known as the _Alexandroff compactification_ after a 1924 paper by [[Pavel Aleksandrov|Павел Сергеевич Александров]] (then transliterated 'P.S. Aleksandroff'). 

The one-point compactification is usually applied to a non-[[compact space|compact]] [[locally compact space|locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] space.  In the more general situation, it may not really be a [[compactification]] and hence is called the _one-point extension_ or _Alexandroff extension_.


## Definition

### For topological spaces

+-- {: .num_defn #OnePointExtension}
###### Definition
**(one-point extension)**

Let $X$ be any [[topological space]]. Its **one-point extension** $X^*$ is the topological space 

* whose underlying [[set]] is the [[disjoint union]] $X \cup \{\infty\}$ 

* and whose [[open sets]] are 

  1. the open subsets of $X$ (thought of as subsets of $X^*$);

  2. the [[complements]] $X^\ast \backslash CK = (X \backslash CK) \cup \{\infty\}$ of the [[closed subspace|closed]] [[compact space|compact]] subsets $CK \subset X$.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

If $X$ is [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]], then it is sufficient to speak of compact subsets in def. \ref{OnePointExtension}, since [[compact subspaces of Hausdorff spaces are closed]].

=--

+-- {: .num_lemma #OnePointExtensionWellDefined}
###### Lemma
**(one-point extension is well-defined)**

The [[topological space|topology]] on the one-point extension in def. \ref{OnePointExtension} is indeed well defined in that the given set of subsets is indeed closed under arbitrary unions and finite intersections.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The unions and finite intersections of the open subsets inherited from $X$ are closed among themselves by the assumption that $X$ is a topological space.

It is hence sufficient to see that 

1. the unions and finite intersection of the $(X \backslash CK) \cup \{\infty\}$ are closed among themselves,

1. the union and intersection of a subset of the form $U \underset{\text{open}}{\subset} X \subset X^\ast$ with one of the form $(X \backslash CK) \cup \{\infty\}$ is again of one of the two kinds.

Regarding the first statement: Under [[de Morgan duality]] 

$$  
  \underset{
     i \in \underset{\text{finite}}{J}
  }{\cap} 
   (X \backslash CK_i \cup \{\infty\})
  = 
  X \backslash
  \left(
     \left(\underset{i \in \underset{\text{finite}}{J}}{\cup} CK_i \right)
     \cup
     \{\infty\}
  \right)
$$

and

$$
  \underset{i \in I}{\cup} ( X \backslash C_i \cup \{\infty\} )
  = 
  X \backslash
  \left(
    \left(\underset{i \in I}{\cap} CK_i \right)
    \cup 
    \{\infty\}
  \right)
$$

and so the first statement follows from the fact that finite unions of compact subspaces and arbitrary intersections of closed compact subspaces are themselves again compact ([this prop.](compact+space#UnionsAndIntersectionOfCompactSubspaces)).

Regarding the second statement: That $U \subset X$ is open means that there exists a closed subset $C \subset X$ with $U = X\backslash C$. Now using [[de Morgan duality]] we find

1. for intersections:

   $$
     \begin{aligned}
       U \cap ( (X\backslash CK) \cup \{\infty\} )
       & = 
       (X \backslash C) \cap (X \backslash CK)
       \\
       & =
       X \backslash ( C \cup CK )
     \end{aligned}
   $$

   Since finite unions of closed subsets are closed, this is again an open subset of $X$;

1. for unions:

   $$
     \begin{aligned}
       U \cup (X \backslash CK) \cup \{\infty\}
       & = 
       (X \backslash C) \cup (X \backslash CU) \cup \{\infty\}
       \\
       & =
       (X \backslash (C \cap CK)) \cup \{\infty\} 
     \end{aligned}
     \,.
   $$ 

   For this to be open in $X^\ast$ we need that $C \cap CK$ is again compact. This follows because [[subsets are closed in a closed subspace precisely if they are closed in the ambient space]] and because [[closed subsets of compact spaces are compact]].


=--



### For non-commutative topological spaces ($C^\ast$-algebras)

Dually in [[non-commutative topology]] the one-point compactification corresponds to the [[unitisation of C*-algebras]].


## Properties

### Basic properties
 {#BasicProperties}

We discuss the basic properties of the construction $X^\ast$ in def. \ref{OnePointExtension}, in particular that it always yields a [[compact topological space]] (prop. \ref{OnePointExtensionIsCompact} below) and the ingredients needed to see its [[universal property]] in the Hausdorff case [below](#OnePointExtensionIsCompact).

+-- {: .num_prop #OnePointExtensionIsCompact}
###### Proposition
**(one-point extension is compact)**

For $X$ any [[topological space]], then its one-point extension $X^\ast$ (def. \ref{OnePointExtension}) is a [[compact topological space]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let $\{U_i \subset X^\ast\}_{i \in I}$ be an [[open cover]].  We need to show that this has a finite subcover.

That we have a cover means that 

1. there must exist $i_\infty \in I$ such that $U_{i \infty} \supset \{\infty\}$ is an [[open neighbourhood]] of the extra point. But since, by construction, the only open subsets containing that point are of the form $(X \backslash CK) \cup \{\infty\}$, it follows that there is a compact closed subset $CK \subset X$ with $X \backslash CK \subset U_{i \infty}$. 

1. $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in i}$ is in particular an open cover of that closed compact subset $CK \subset X$. This being compact means that there is a finite subset $J \subset I$ so that $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in \J \subset X}$ is still a cover of $CK$. 

Together this implies that 

$$
  \{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in J \subset I}
  \cup
  \{ U_{i_\infty} \}
$$

is a finite subcover of the original cover.


=--

+-- {: .num_prop #HausdorffOnePointCompactification}
###### Proposition
**(one-point extension of locally compact space is Hausdorff precisely if original space is)

Let $X$ be a [[locally compact topological space]]. Then its one-point extension $X^\ast$ (def. \ref{OnePointExtension}) is a [[Hausdorff topological space]] precisely if $X$ is. 

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

It is clear that if $X$ is not Hausdorff then $X^\ast$ is not.

For the converse, assume that $X$ is Hausdorff.  

Since $X^\ast = X \cup \{\infty\}$ as underlying sets, we only need to check that for $x \in X$ any point, then there is an open neighbourhood $U_x \subset X \subset X^\ast$ and an open neighbourhood $V_\infty \subset X^\ast$ of the extra point which are disjoint.

That $X$ is locally compact implies by definition that there exists an open neighbourhood $U_k \supset \{x\}$ whose [[topological closure]] $CK \coloneqq Cl(U_x)$ is a closed compact neighbourhood $CK \supset \{x\}$. Hence 

$$
  V_\infty \coloneqq (X \backslash CK ) \cup \{\infty\} \subset X^\ast
$$

is an open neighbourhood of $\{\infty\}$ and the two are disjoint 

$$
  U_x \cap V_\infty = \emptyset
$$

by construction.


=--


+-- {: .num_prop #InclusionIntoOnePointExtensionIsOpenEmbedding}
###### Proposition
**(inclusion into one-point extension is open embedding)**

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]]. Then the evident inclusion function

$$
  i \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow X^\ast
$$

into its one-point extension (def. \ref{OnePointExtension}) is 

1. a [[continuous function]] 

1. an [[open map]]

1. an [[embedding of topological spaces]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Regarding the first point: For $U \subset X$ open and $CK \subset X$ closed and compact, the preimages of the corresponding open subsets in $X^\ast$ are

$$
  i^{-1}(U) = U
  \phantom{AAAA}
  i^{-1}( (X \backslash CK) \cup \infty ) = X \backslash CK
$$

which are open in $X$.


Regarding the second point:  The image of an open subset $U \subset X$ is $i(U) = U \subset X^\ast$, which is open by definition.

Regarding the third point: We need to show that $i \colon X \to i(X) \subset X^\ast$ is a [[homeomorphism]]. This is immediate from the definition of $X^\ast$.

=--



+-- {: .num_remark #CompactHausdorffSpaceIsCompactificationOfComplementOfAnyPoint}
###### Remark

For $X$ a [[compact Hausdorff space]] and $x_0 \in X$ any point, then 
$X$ is [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to the one-point compactification
of the [[complement]] [[subspace]] $X \setminus \{x_0\} \subset X$:

$$
  X \simeq (X \setminus \{x_0\})^\ast
  \,.
$$

Observe also that $X \setminus \{x_0\}$, being an [[open subspace]] of a [[compact Hausdorff space]] is a [[locally compact topological space]], since [[open subspaces of compact Hausdorff spaces are locally compact]], and of course it is Hausdorff, since $X$ is.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Since [[closed subspaces of compact Hausdorff spaces are equivalently compact subspaces]], the open neighbourhoods of $x \in X$ are equivalently the
complements of closed, and hence compact closed, subsets in $X \setminus \{x\}$. By def. \ref{OnePointExtension} this means that the function

$$
  \array{
     X &\longrightarrow& (X \setminus \{x_0\})^\ast
  }
$$

which is the identity on $X \setminus \{x_0\}$ and sends $x_0 \mapsto \infty$ (hence which is just the identity on the underlying sets) is a [[homeomorphism]].

=--


### Universal property
  {#UniversalProperty}

As a [[pointed topological space|pointed]] [[compact Hausdorff space]], the one-point compactification of $X$ may be described by a [[universal property]]: 

For every [[pointed topological space|pointed]] [[compact topological space|compact]] [[Hausdorff space]] $(Y, y_0)$ and every [[continuous map]] $f \colon X \to Y$ such that the [[pre-image]] $f^{-1}(K)$ is compact for all compact sets $K$ not containing $y_0$, there is a unique basepoint-preserving continuous map $X^\ast \to Y$ that extends $f$. 

This property characterizes $X^\ast$ in an [[essentially unique]] manner.

$X$ is [[dense subspace|dense]] in $X^*$ precisely if $X$ is not already compact.  Note that $X^*$ is technically a [[compactification]] of $X$ only in this case.

$X^*$ is [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] (hence a [[compactum]]) if and only if $X$ is already both Hausdorff and [[locally compact space|locally compact]] (see prop. \ref{HausdorffOnePointCompactification}).

### Functoriality

The operation of one-point compactification is not a [[functor]] on the whole [[category]] of [[topological spaces]]. But it does extend to a [[functor]] on [[topological spaces]] with [[proper maps]] between them.

## Examples

### Spheres
 {#ExamplesSpheres}

+-- {: .num_example #nSphereIsOnePointCompactificationOfRn}
###### Example

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the [[n-sphere]] with its standard [[topological space|topology]] (e.g. as a [[subspace]] of the [[Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ with its [[metric topology]]) is [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to the one-point compactification (def. \ref{OnePointExtension}) of the [[Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$

$$
  S^n \simeq (\mathbb{R}^n)^\ast
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Pick a point $\infty \in S^n$. By [[stereographic projection]] we have a [[homeomorphism]]

$$
  S^n \setminus \{\infty\} \simeq \mathbb{R}^n
  \,.
$$

With this it only remains to see that for $U_\infty \supset \{\infty\}$ an open neighbourhood of $\infty$ in $S^n$ then the complement $S^n \setminus U_\infty$ is compact closed, and cnversely that the complement of every compact closed subset of $S^n \setminus \{\infty\}$ is an open neighbourhood of $\{\infty\}$.

Observe that under [[stereographic projection]] the open subspaces $U_\infty \setminus \{\infty\} \subset S^n \setminus \{\infty\}$ are identified precisely with the [[closed subset|closed]] and [[bounded subsets]] of $\mathbb{R}^n$. (Closure is immediate, boundedness follows because an open neighbourhood of $\{\infty\} \in S^n$ needs to contain an open ball around $0 \in \mathbb{R}^n \simeq S^n \setminus \{-\infty\}$ in the _other_ stereographic projection, which under change of chart gives a bounded subset. )

By the [[Heine-Borel theorem]] the closed and bounded subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$ are precisely the compact, and hence the compact closed, subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n \simeq S^n \setminus \{\infty\}$.


=--

Via the presentation of example \ref{nSphereIsOnePointCompactificationOfRn}, the canonical [[action]] of the [[orthogonal group]] $O(N)$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ induces an action of $O(n)$ on $S^n$, which preserves the basepoint $\infty$ (the "point at infinity").

This construction presents the [[J-homomorphism]] in [[stable homotopy theory]] and is encoded for instance in the definition of [[orthogonal spectra]].

Slightly more generally, for $V$ any real [[vector space]] of [[dimension]] $n$ one has $S^n \simeq (V)^\ast$. In this context and in view of the previous case, one usually writes

$$
  S^V \coloneqq (V)^\ast
$$

for the $n$-[[sphere]] obtained as the one-point compactification of the vector space $V$.

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

For $V,W \in Vect_{\mathbb{R}}$ two real [[vector spaces]], there is a [[natural transformation|natural]] [[homeomorphism]]

$$
  S^V \wedge S^W \simeq S^{V\oplus W}
$$

between the [[smash product]] of their one-point compactifications and the one-point compactification of the [[direct sum]].

=--

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

In particular, it follows directly from this that the [[suspension]] $\Sigma(-) \simeq S^1 \wedge (-)$ of the $n$-sphere is the $(n+1)$-sphere, up to [[homeomorphism]]:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \Sigma S^n 
    & \simeq S^{\mathbb{R}^1} \wedge S^{\mathbb{R}^n}
    \\
    & \simeq S^{\mathbb{R}^1 \oplus \mathbb{R}^n}
    \\
    & \simeq S^{\mathbb{R}^{n+1}}
    \\
    & \simeq S^{n+1}
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

=--



### Thom spaces

For $X$ a [[compact topological space]] and $V \to X$
a [[vector bundle]], then the ([[homotopy type]] of the) one-point compactification of 
the total space $V$ is the [[Thom space]] of $V$, equivalent to $D(V)/S(V)$. 

For a simple example: the real [[projective plane]] $\mathbb{RP}^2$ is the one-point compactification of the 'open' [[Moebius strip|Möbius strip]], as line bundle over $S^1$. This is a special case of the more general observation that $\mathbb{RP}^{n+1}$ is the Thom space of the [[tautological line bundle]] over $\mathbb{RP}^n$. 

### Locally compact Hausdorff spaces

+-- {: .num_example #LocallyCompatcHausdorffSpaceIsOpenSubspaceOfCompactHausdorffSpace}
###### Example
**(every [[locally compact topological space|locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space]] is an [[open subset|open]] [[subspace]] of a [[compact Hausdorff space]])**

Every [[locally compact topological space|locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space]]  is [[homeomorphism|homemorphic]] to a [[open subset|open]] [[topological subspace]] of a [[compact topological space]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

In one direction the statement is that [[open subspaces of compact Hausdorff spaces are locally compact]] (see there for the proof). What we need to show is that every locally compact Hausdorff spaces arises this way.

So let $X$ be a locally compact Hausdorff space. By prop. \ref{OnePointExtensionIsCompact} and prop. \ref{HausdorffOnePointCompactification} its one-point extension $X^\ast$ (def. \ref{OnePointExtension}) is a [[compact Hausdorff space]]. By prop. \ref{InclusionIntoOnePointExtensionIsOpenEmbedding} the canonical inclusion $X \to X^\ast$ is an [[open map|open]] [[embedding of topological spaces]].
