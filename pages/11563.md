## Idea

The [[de Rham cohomology]] and [[Dolbeault cohomology]] can be viewed as [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] theories with [[coefficients]] in the sheaf of [[locally constant functions]], respectively [[holomorphic functions]]. Spencer cohomology is a generalization of these two cohomologies for the case of the solution sheaf of an arbitrary [[linear operator|linear]] [[differential operator]].
