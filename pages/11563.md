>The [[de Rham cohomology]] and [[Dolbeault cohomology]] can be viewed as cohomologies with coefficients in the sheaf of locally constant, respectively harmonic, functions. Spencer cohomology is a generalization of these two cohomologies for the case of the solution sheaf of an arbitrary linear differential operator.
