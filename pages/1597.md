A [[subcategory]] is **strictly full** if it is [[full subcategory|full]] and closed under isomorphism (i.e. [[replete subcategory|replete]]).

Note that, as a condition on subcategories, being strictly full is a property that does not respect the [[principle of equivalence]] of [[category theory]]; however, seeing the full subcategory as a condition on objects, that condition is in accord with the [[principle of equivalence]] precisely when the full subcategory is strictly full!
