## Definition

A **local homeomorphism**  is a [[continuous map]] $p : E \to B$ between [[topological space]]s (a [[morphism]] in [[Top]]) such that

* for every $e \in E$, there is an open set $U \ni e$ such that the [[image]] $p_*(U)$ is open in $B$ and the restriction of $p$ to $U$ is a [[homeomorphism]] $p|_U: U \to p_*(U)$,

or equivalently

* for every $e \in E$, there is a [[neighbourhood]] $U$ of $e$ such that the image $p_*(U)$ is a neighbourhood of $p(e)$ and $p|_U: U \to p_*(U)$ is a homeomorphism.
