A **local homeomorphism**  is a [[morphism]] $p : E \to B$ in the [[category]] [[Top]] of [[topological space]]s and continuous maps betweem them such that

* for every $e \in E$, there is an open neighborhood $U \ni e$ such that the [[image]] $p_*(U)$ is open in $B$ and the restriction of $p$ to $U$ is a [[homeomorphism]] $p|_U: U \to p_*(U)$,

or equivalently

* for every $e \in E$, there is a (not necessarily open) neighbourhood $U \ni e$ such that the image $p_*(U)$ is a neighbourhood of $p(e)$ and $p|_U: U \to p_*(U)$ is a homeomorphism.
