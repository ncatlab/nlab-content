## Idea

The _universal complex line bundle_ is the [[complex vector bundle|complex]] [[universal vector bundle]] of [[rank]] 1, hence the [[complex line bundle]] which is [[associated bundle|associated]] to the [[circle group]]-[[universal principal bundle]] $E U(1)$ over the [[classifying space]] $B U(1)$ via the canonical [[action]] of $U(1)$ on $\mathbb{C}$.

Under the identification $B \mathrm{U}(1) \,\simeq\, \mathbb{C}P^\infty$ of the $\mathrm{U}(1)$-[[classifying space]] with the infinite [[complex projective spaces]], this is the [[dual vector bundle|dual]] [[tautological line bundle]] on the latter.

Its [[pullback bundle]] along the canonical inclusion $S^2 \longrightarrow B U(1)$ (the map which represents $1 \in \pi_2(B U(1)) \simeq \mathbb{Z}$) is the _[[basic complex line bundle on the 2-sphere]]_.
