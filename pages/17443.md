## Idea

Essential [[sublocales]] are intermediate between [[open sublocales]] and [[locally connected geometric morphism|locally connected sublocales]].

###### Definition
A [[sublocale]] $X_j$ of a [[locale]] $X$, given by a [[nucleus]] $j : \mathcal{O}(X) \to \mathcal{O}(X)$, is called *essential* (sometimes also *principal*) if and only if the following equivalent conditions are satisfied:

1. There is a monotone map $b : \mathcal{O}(X) \to \mathcal{O}(X)$ which is [[left adjoint]] to $j$.
2. The nucleus $j$ preserves arbitrary (not only finite) meets.
3. For any $u \in \mathcal{O}(X)$, there is a smallest $v \in \mathcal{O}(X)$ such that $u \preceq j(v)$.
4. The sheafification functor $\mathrm{Sh}(X) \to \mathrm{Sh}(X_j)$ possesses a left adjoint (it always has a right adjoint).
5. The [[geometric embedding]] $\mathrm{Sh}(X_j) \hookrightarrow \mathrm{Sh}(X)$ is an [[essential geometric morphism]].

The equivalence of 1. and 2. is by the [[adjoint functor theorem]] for complete lattices, which furthermore gives an explicit formula for the left adjoint $b$, namely
$$ b(u) \coloneqq inf \{ v \in \mathcal{O}(X) \,|\, u \preceq j(v) \}. $$
This also shows the equivalence of 1. and 3.
