## Idea

Essential [[sublocales]] are intermediate between [[open sublocales]] and [[locally connected geometric morphism|locally connected sublocales]].

## Definition

###### Definition
A [[sublocale]] $X_j$ of a [[locale]] $X$, given by a [[nucleus]] $j : \mathcal{O}(X) \to \mathcal{O}(X)$, is called *essential* (sometimes also *principal*) if and only if the following equivalent conditions are satisfied:

1. There is a monotone map $b : \mathcal{O}(X) \to \mathcal{O}(X)$ which is [[left adjoint]] to $j$.
2. The nucleus $j$ preserves arbitrary (not only finite) meets.
3. For any $u \in \mathcal{O}(X)$, there is a smallest $v \in \mathcal{O}(X)$ such that $u \preceq j(v)$.
4. The pullback functor $\mathrm{Sh}(X) \to \mathrm{Sh}(X_j)$ possesses a left adjoint (it always has a right adjoint).
5. The [[geometric embedding]] $\mathrm{Sh}(X_j) \hookrightarrow \mathrm{Sh}(X)$ is an [[essential geometric morphism]].

The equivalence of 1. and 2. is by the [[adjoint functor theorem]] for complete lattices, which furthermore gives an explicit formula for the left adjoint $b$, namely
$$ b(u) \coloneqq inf \{ v \in \mathcal{O}(X) \,|\, u \preceq j(v) \}. $$
This also shows the equivalence of 1. and 3. The equivalence of 4. and 5. is by definition. The equivalence of 3. and 4. is by ...

###### Remark
The left adjoint $b$ automatically satisfies $b(u) \preceq u$ and $b(b(u)) = u$ for all $u \in \mathcal{O}(X)$. This follows from the dual inequalities for $j$ by adjunction.

## Examples

* Any [[open sublocale]] is essential: The nucleus for an open sublocale is of the form $j = (u \rightarrow -)$. Its left adjoint is $b = (- \wedge u)$.


## Properties

* For a general sublocale $i : X_j \hookrightarrow X$ and a sheaf $\mathcal{F}$ on $X$, the pullback $i^{-1} \mathcal{F}$ is the [[sheafification]] of the presheaf
$$ u \mapsto \colim_{u \preceq j(v)} \mathcal{F}(v). $$
In the case that $X_j$ is an essential sublocale, this presheaf is simply given by the formula
$$ u \mapsto \mathcal{F}(b(u)) $$
and is already a sheaf, so sheafification is not necessary.

* On [math.SE](http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1776136/are-intersections-of-essential-sublocales-essential) there is a question whether arbitrary intersections of essential sublocales are essential.
