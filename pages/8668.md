## Basic idea in category theory
 {#BasicIdea}

The general idea is that a _[[locally presentable category]]_ is a [[large category]] [[generators and relations|generated from]] small data: from [[small objects]] under [[small colimit]]. 

### Generation from generators

The notion of _[[locally presentable category]]_ is, at least roughly, an analogue for [[categories]] of the notion of a [[finitely generated module]].

+-- {: .num_example ##FinitelyGeneratedAbelianGroup}
###### Example

An [[abelian group]] $A$ is called _[[finitely generated module|finitely generated]]_ if there is a [[finite set|finite]] [[subset]]

$$
  \iota \colon S \hookrightarrow U(A)
$$ 

of the underlying set $U(A)$ of $A$, such that every element of $A$ is a sum of such generating elements. 

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

We always have the maximal such presentation where $S = U(A)$ is the whole underlying set and $\iota \colon F(U(A)) \to A$ is the [[counit of an adjunction|counit]] of the [[free-forgetful adjunction]]. But the presentation is all the more interesting/useful the _smaller_ $S$ is. 

=--

Now, the [[categorification]] of "commutative sum" is _[[colimit]]_. Hence let now $\mathcal{C}$ be a category with all [[small colimits]].

+-- {: .num_defn #GenerationOfCategoryFromSubcategoryUnderColimits}
###### Definition

We say a subclass $S \hookrightarrow Obj(\mathcal{C})$ of [[objects]] or equivalently the [[full subcategory]] $\mathcal{C}^0 \hookrightarrow \mathcal{C}$ on this subclass _generates_ $\mathcal{C}$ if every object in $\mathcal{C}$ is a [[colimit]] of objects in $\mathcal{C}^0$, hence the colimit over a [[diagram]] of the form

$$
  D \to \mathcal{C}^0 \hookrightarrow \mathcal{C}
  \,.
$$

=--

As before, such a presentation is all the more useful the "smaller" the generating data is. In order to grasp the various aspects of the notion of "smallness" in [[category theory]] we need the notion of [[regular cardinal]].

### Small data

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

The [[cardinality]] $\kappa = {\vert S\vert}$ of a [[set]] $S$ is _[[regular cardinal|regular]]_ if every [[coproduct]]/[[disjoint union]] of sets of cardinality smaller than $\kappa$ and indexed by a set of cardinality smaller than $\kappa$ is itself of cardinality smaller than $\kappa$.

=--

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

The smallest [[regular cardinal]] is [[ℵ]]${}_0 = {\vert \mathbb{N}\vert}$: every finite union of finite sets is itself a finite set.

=--

We can now speak of objects that are "$\kappa$-small sums" using the notion of $\kappa$-[[filtered colimits]]:

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For $\kappa$ a [[regular cardinal]], a $\kappa$-[[filtered category]] is one where every [[diagram]] of size $\lt \kappa$ has a [[cocone]].

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

For $\lambda \gt \kappa$ a bigger [[regular cardinal]], every $\lambda$-[[filtered category]] is in particular also $\kappa$-filtered.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A $\kappa$-[[filtered colimit]] is a [[colimit]] over a $\kappa$-filtered diagram.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

An [[object]] $A \in \mathcal{C}$ is a $\kappa$-[[compact object]] if it commutes with $\kappa$-filtered colimits, hence  if for $X \colon I \to \mathcal{C}$ any $\kappa$-[[filtered category|filtered]] [[diagram]], the canonical [[function]]

$$
  \underset{\to_i}{\lim} \mathcal{C}(A,X_i) \to \mathcal{C}(A, \underset{\to_i}{\lim} X_i)
$$

is a [[bijection]]. 

We say $X$ is a **[[small object]]** if it is $\kappa$-compact for _some_ [[regular cardinal]] $\kappa$.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

If $\lambda \gt \kappa$, then being $\lambda$-compact is a weaker condition that being $\kappa$-comopact. 

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark


The object $A$ commutes with the colimit over $I$ precisely if every morphism $A \to \underset{\to_i}{\lim} X_i $ lifts to a morphism $A \to X_j$ into one of the $X_j$. Scematically, depicting specifically a [[sequential colimit]], this means that we have:

$$
  \array{
    \cdots&\to&X_{j-1} &\to& X_j &\to& X_{j+1} &\to& \cdots
    \\
    &&&{}^{\mathllap{\exists \hat f}}\nearrow&\downarrow & \swarrow
    \\
    &&A& \stackrel{f}{\to} & \underset{\to}{\lim} X_i
  }
  \,.
$$

Hence $A$ is "small enough" such that mapping it into the sum of all the $X_i$ it always entirely lands inside one of the $X_i$.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

If $\lambda \gt \kappa$, then being $\lambda$-compact is a weaker condition that being $\kappa$-comopact.

### Locally presentable category: generated from colimits over small objects

Using this we can now say:

+-- {: .num_defn #LocallyPresentableCategory}
###### Definition

A [[locally small category]] $\mathcal{C}$ is a _[[locally presentable category]]_ if there is a [[small set]] $S \hookrightarrow Obj(\mathcal{C})$ of [[small objects]] such that this generates $\mathcal{C}$, by def. \ref{GenerationOfCategoryFromSubcategoryUnderColimits}.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

The ajective "locally" in "[[locally presentable category]]" is to indicate that the condition is all about the [[objects]], only. There is a different notion of "presented category".

=--

There are a bunch of equivalent reformulations of the notion of locally presentable category. One of the more important once we again motivate first by analogy with presentable modules:

### Generation exhibited by epimorphism from a free object

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

If an [[abelian group]] $A$ is generated by a set $S \hookrightarrow U(A)$ as in example \ref{FinitelyGeneratedAbelianGroup}, this means equivalently that there is an [[epimorphism]]

$$
  L \colon F(S) \to A
$$

from the [[free abelian group]] $F(S)$ generated by $S$, hence the group obtained by forming [[formal linear combination|formal sums]] of elements in $S$. Here the epimorphism sends formal sums to actual sums in $A$:

$$
  L(\sum_k s_k) \coloneqq \sum_k \iota(s_k)
  \,.
$$

=--


+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

The [[categorification]] of the notion _[[free abelian group]]_ is the notion of _[[free cocompletion]]_ of a category $\mathcal{C}^0$: the [[category of presheaves]] $PSh(\mathcal{C}^0)$. 

=--

Accordingly:

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

If a [[full subcategory]] $\iota \colon \mathcal{C}^0 \hookrightarrow \mathcal{C}$ generates $\mathcal{C}$ under colimits as in defn. \ref{GenerationOfCategoryFromSubcategoryUnderColimits}, then there is a [[functor]]

$$
  L \colon PSh(\mathcal{C}^0) \to \mathcal{C}
$$

which sends formal colimits to actual colimits in $\mathcal{C}$

$$
  L(\underset{\to_k}{\lim} s_k) \coloneqq \underset{\to_k}{\lim} \iota(s_k)
  \,.
$$

Here $L$ by construction preserves all colimits. 

=--

Therefore conversely, given a colimit-preserving functor $L \colon PSh(\mathcal{C}^0) \to \mathcal{C}$ we want to say that it _locally presents_ $\mathcal{C}$ if $L$ is "suitably epi".

It turns out that "suitably epi" is to be the following:

+-- {: .num_defn #Localization}
###### Definition

A [[functor]] $L \colon PSh(\mathcal{C}^0) \to \mathcal{C}$ from the [[category of presheaves]] over a [[small category]] $\mathcal{C}^0$ is an **[[accessible functor|accessible]] [[localization]] if

*  $L$ has a [[section]], hence a [[functor]] $R \colon \mathcal{C} \to PSh(\mathcal{C}^0)$ with a [[natural isomorphism]] $L\circ R \simeq id_{\mathcal{C}}$;

* such that 

  1. $R$ is [[right adjoint]] to $L$;

  1. $\mathcal{C}$ has and $R$ preserves $\kappa$-[[filtered colimits]] for some [[regular cardinal]] $\kappa$.

=--

With this notion we have the following analog of the familiar statement that an abelian group is generated by $S$ precisely if there is an epimorphism $L \colon F(S) \to A$:

+-- {: .num_theorem #AdamekRosickyTheorem}
###### Theorem

A category $\mathcal{C}$ is locally presentable according to def. \ref{LocallyPresentableCategory} precisely if it is an accessible localization, def. \ref{Localization}, 

$$
  L \colon PSh(\mathcal{C}^0) \to \mathcal{C}
$$

for some small category $\mathcal{C}^0$. 

=--

### Left exact localizations


+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

A [[locally presentable category]] $\mathcal{C}$ is called a _[[topos]]_, precisely if the localization functor $L \colon PSh(\mathcal{C}^0) \to \mathcal{C} $ from theorem \ref{AdamekRosickyTheorem} in addition is a [[left exact functor]], meaning that it preserves [[finite limits]].

## Summary and overview

In summary the discussion [above](#BasicIdea) says that the notion of locally presenatble categories sits in a sequence of notions as indicated in the row labeled "category theory" in the following table. The other rows are supposed to indicate that regarding a category as a [[(1,1)-category]] and simply varying in this story the parameters $(n,r)$ in "[[(n,r)-category]]" one obtains farily straightforward analogs of the notion of locally presentable category in other fragments of [[higher category theory]]. These we discuss in more detail further below.
