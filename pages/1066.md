## Idea

The [[homotopy category]] of an [[(∞,1)-category]] $\mathcal{C}$ is its [[decategorification]] to an ordinary [[category]] obtained by identifying 1-[[morphism]]s that are connected by a [[2-morphism]].

If the [[(∞,1)-category]] $\mathcal{C}$ is presented by a [[category with weak equivalences]] $C$ (for instance as the [[simplicial localization]] $\mathcal{C} = L C$) then the notion of [[homotopy category]] of $C$ (where the weak equivalences are universally turned into [[isomorphism]]s) coinicides with that of $\mathcal{C}$:

$$
  Ho(\mathcal{C}) \simeq Ho(C)
  \,.
$$




## Definition 

The details of the definition depend on the chosen model for $(\infty,1)$-categories, as either

* [[simplicially enriched category]]/ Top-category

* [[complete Segal space]]

* [[Segal category]]

* [[quasi-category]]

## For simplicially enriched categories##

The **homotopy category** $h C$ of a [[sSet]]-[[enriched category]] $C$ (equivalently of a [[Top]]-[[enriched category]]) is hom-wise the image under the functor

$$
  \pi_0 : sSet \to Set
 \,,
$$

which sends each [[simplicial set]] to its 0th [[homotopy group|homotopy set]]
of [[connected]] components, i.e. to the set of [[path component]]s:

$$
  Hom_{h C}(A,B) := \pi_0(Hom_C(A,B))
  \,.
$$

Sometimes it is useful to regard this after all as an enriched category, but now enriched over the [[homotopy category]] of the standard [[model structure on simplicial sets]] $sSet_{Quillen}$, which is the _homotopy category of an $(\infty,1)$-category_ of [[∞Grpd]].

Let $\mathbf{h}: sSet \to Ho(sSet)$ be the localization functor to the [[homotopy category]] (of a [[category with weak equivalences]]).  This functor is a [[monoidal functor]] by the fact that the cartesian monoidal product is a left-[[Quillen bifunctor]] for $sSet$, which means that since every object in $sSet$ is cofibrant, it preserves weak equivalences in both arguments and hence descends to the homotopy category

$$
  \array{
    sSet \times sSet &\stackrel{\times}{\to}& sSet
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mathbf{h} \times \mathbf{h}}}
    &&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mathbf{h}}}
    \\
    Ho(sSet) \times Ho(sSet) &\stackrel{\mathbf{h}(\times)}{\to}&
    Ho(sSet)
  }
  \,.
$$

This inuces a canonical functor $h:sSet Cat\to Ho(sSet) Cat$ which is given by the identity on objects and: $Map_{h C}(A,B):=\mathbf{h} Map_{C}(A,B)$.   Then since $Hom_C(A,B)=Hom_{sSet}(\Delta^0,Map_{C}(A,B))$, it is easy to see that $Hom_{hC}(A,B)=Hom_{Ho(sSet)}(\mathbf{h} \Delta^0, \mathbf{h} Map_C(A,B))=\pi_0 Map_C(A,B)$.  



## For complete Segal spaces and Segal categories ##

Similar, but more complicated, definitions work for [[complete Segal space]]s and [[Segal category|Segal categories]].


##For quasi-categories ##

For [[quasi-category|quasi-categories]], one can write down a definition similar to those of $sSet$-enriched categories.

Viewing $C$ as a [[simplicial set]], the homotopy category $hC$ can also be described as its [[fundamental category]] $\tau_1(C)$, i.e. the image of $C$ by the [[left adjoint]] $\tau_1 : SSet \to Cat$ of the [[nerve]] functor $N$.
