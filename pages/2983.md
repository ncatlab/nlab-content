A **building** (also **Tits building**, **Bruhatâ€“Tits building**) is a combinatorial and geometric structure which simultaneously generalizes certain aspects of [[flag manifold]]s, finite [[projective plane]]s, and [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian]] [[symmetric space]]s.

Initially introduced by [[Jacques Tits]] as a means to understand the structure of [[exceptional Lie group]]s, the theory has also been used to study the geometry and topology of [[homogeneous space]]s of p-adic Lie groups and their discrete subgroups of symmetries, in the same way that [[tree]]s have been used to study [[free group]]s.
