## Idea

The _covering lifting property_ on a [[functor]] between [[sites]] is a sufficient condition for it to induce a [[geometric morphism]] between the corresponding [[sheaf toposes]] _covariantly_, i.e. with [[direct image]] going in the same direction.

(As opposed to a [[morphism of sites]], which induces a geometric morphism contravariantly, going the other way around.)

## Definition

A [[functor]] $F \colon \mathcal{S}_1 \to \mathcal{S}_2$ between [[sites]] is said to have the _covering lifting property_ ([MacLane-Moerdijk, p. 410](#MacLaneMoerdijk)) if for every obect $X \in \mathcal{S}_1$ and every cover $Cov_2$ of $F(X)$ there is a cover $Cov_1$ of $X$ such that $F(Cov_1) \subset Cov_2$, hence if every cover of the image of any $X$ under $F$  is refined by the image of a cover of $X$.

## Properties

A functor between sites with covering lifting property induces a [[geometric morphisms]] between the coresponding [[sheaf toposes]] covariantly, with [[inverse image]] given by pre-composition with $F$ (followed by [[sheafification]]). ([MacLane-Moerdijk, VII, theorem 5](#MacLaneMoerdijk))
