## Idea

A common condition on [[subgroups]] of a [[topological group]] is that they be [[closed subspaces|closed]]. 

This is typically required in [[equivariant differential topology]]/[[equivariant homotopy theory]], for instance in the definition of the [[orbit category]].

## Definition

A [[topological group|topological]] [[subgroup]] $H \subset G$ of a [[topological group]] $G$ is called a _closed subgroup_ if as a [[topological subspace]] it is a [[closed subspace]].

## Properties

### Localic subgroups

Any localic subgroup of a [[localic group]] is closed (see [this Theorem](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/localic+group#LocalicSubgroupsAreClosed)).
