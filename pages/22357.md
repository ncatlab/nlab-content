## Idea

A common condition on [[subgroups]] of a [[topological group]] is that they be [[closed subspaces|closed]]. 

This is typically required in [[equivariant differential topology]]/[[equivariant homotopy theory]], for instance in the definition of the [[orbit category]].

## Definition

A [[topological group|topological]] [[subgroup]] $H \subset G$ of a [[topological group]] $G$ is called a _closed subgroup_ if as a [[topological subspace]] it is a [[closed subspace]].

## Localic subgroups

Any subgroup of a [[localic group]] is automatically closed.
See there for more information.
