##Idea

In the 1960s R. Thompson introduced three finitely presented [[group|groups]] with some remarkable properties that are today called **Thompson groups** and differentiated by prefixing the letters F, T, and V. The property of resurfacing in different guises in apparently unrelated mathematical fields earned them the nickname _Chameleon groups_.
