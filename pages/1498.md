#Content#

[[Jim Stasheff]] has spent much of his work on identifying and studying _cohomological_ (as in: [[homological algebra]]) and _homotopical_ (as in: [[homotopy theory]]) structures in [[physics]]. 

This includes notably the invention and study of homotopy-coherent structures such as [[A-infinity operad]]s, [[A-infinity algebra]]s and [[L-infinity-algebra]]s and their application to [[BV theory]], [[string field theory]]  (longer list of links should eventually go here). 

The above survey lists key concepts and collects references to further literature.

#Higher categorical background#

Essentially using variants of the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] one may regard many of these [[differential graded algebra]] structures as [[higher category theory|higher categorical]] structures. For instance the [[pretriangulated dg-category|pretriangulated dg-categories]] formed by homotopy coherent structures are [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presentations]] for [[stable (infinity,1)-category|stable (infinity,1)-categories]].

In this sense "cohomological physics" is understood as part of [[n-categorical physics]].
