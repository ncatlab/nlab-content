## Definition ##

Given a [[dagger 2-poset]] $A$, the **category of maps** $Map(A)$ is the sub-2-poset whose objects are the objects of $A$ and whose morphisms are the [[map in a dagger 2-poset|maps]] of $A$. In every dagger 2-poset, given two maps $f:Map_A(a,b)$ and $g:Map_A(a,b)$, if $f \leq g$, then $f = g$. This means that the sub-2-poset $Map(A)$ is a [[category]] and trivially a 2-poset. 

## Examples ##

* For the dagger 2-poset [[Rel]] of [[sets]] and [[relations]], the category of maps $Map(Rel)$ is equivalent to the category [[Set]] of sets and functions.
