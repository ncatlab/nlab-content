###### Definition

For $A$, $B$ and $C$ [[abelian groups]] and $A \times B$ the [[cartesian product]] group, a **bilinear map** 

$$
  f : A \times B \to C
$$

is a [[function]] of the underlying [[sets]] which is linear -- hence is a [[group homomorphism]] -- in each argument separately. 

Equivalently this is a map that factors through the [[tensor product of abelian groups]] $A \otimes B$ as

$$
  f : A \times B \to A \otimes B \to C
  \,.
$$

###### Remark

The analogous defintion for more than two arguments yields _[[multilinear maps]]_. There is a [[multicategory]] of abelian groups and multilinear maps between them.
