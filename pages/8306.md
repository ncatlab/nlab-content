### For abelian groups

+-- {: .num_defn #BilinearOnAbelianGroups}
###### Definition

For $A$, $B$ and $C$ [[abelian groups]] and $A \times B$ the [[cartesian product]] group, a **bilinear map** 

$$
  f : A \times B \to C
$$

is a [[function]] of the underlying [[sets]] which is linear -- hence is a [[group homomorphism]] -- in each argument separately. 

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

In terms of [[elements]] this means that 
a bilinear map $f : A \times B \to C$ is a function of sets that satisfies for all elements $a_1, a_2 \in A$ and $b_1, b_2 \in B$ the two relations

$$
  f(a_1 + a_2, b_1) = f(a_1,b_1) + f(a_2, b_2)
$$

and

$$
  f(a_1, b_1 + b_2) = f(a_1, b_1) + f(a_1, b_2)
  \,.
$$

Notice that this is _not_ a group homomorphism out of the product group.
The product group $A \times B$ is the group whose elements are pairs $(a,b)$ with $a \in A$ and $b \in B$, and whose group operation is 

$$
  (a_1, b_1) + (a_2, b_2) = (a_1 + a_2 \;,\; b_1 + b_2)
  \,.
$$

A _[[group homomorphism]]_

$$
  \phi : A \times B \to C
$$

hence satisfies

$$
  \phi( a_1+a_2, b_1 + b_2 ) = \phi(a_1,b_1) + \phi(a_2, b_2)
$$

and hence in particular

$$
  \phi( a_1+a_2, b_1  ) = \phi(a_1,b_1) + \phi(a_2, 0)
$$

$$
  \phi( a_1, b_1 + b_2 ) = \phi(a_1,b_1) + \phi(0, b_2)
$$

which is (in general) different from the behaviour of a bilinear map.

The definition of [[tensor product of abelian groups]] is precisely such that the following is an equivalent definition of bilinear map:

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For $A, B, C \in Ab$ a function of sets $f : A \times B \to C$ 
is a **bilinear map** precisely if it factors through the [[tensor product of abelian groups]] $A \otimes B$ as

$$
  f : A \times B \to A \otimes B \to C
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

The analogous defintion for more than two arguments yields _multilinear maps_. There is a [[multicategory]] of abelian groups and multilinear maps between them.

### For modules

More generally :

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For $R$ a [[ring]] and $A, B, C \in R$[[Mod]] being [[modules]] over that ring, a **bilinear map** on $A$ and $B$ is a function of the underlying sets

$$
  f : A \times B \to C
$$

which is a bilinear map of the underlying [[abelian groups]] as in def. \ref{BilinearOnAbelianGroups} and in addition such that for all $r \in R$ we have

$$
  f(r a, b) = r f(a,b)
$$

and

$$
  f(a, r b) = f f(a,b)
  \,.
$$

=--

As before, this is equivalent to $f$ factoring through the [[tensor product of modules]]

$$
 f : A \times B \to A \otimes_R B \to C
  \,.
$$

## Examples

* For $R = k$ a [[field]], an $R$-[[module]] is a $k$-[[vector space]] and a $R$-bilinear map is a bilinear map out of two vector spaces.
