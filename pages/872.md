In a [[poset]] $P$, a __bottom__ is an element $\bot$ of $P$ such that $\bot \leq a$ for every element $a$.  Such a bottom may not exist; if it does, then it is unique.

In a [[proset]], a bottom may be defined similarly, but it need not be unique.  (However, it is still unique up the natural [[equivalence]] in the proset.)

A bottom of $P$ can also be understood as a [[join]] of zero elements in $P$.

A poset that has both [[top]] and bottom is called _bounded_.

As a poset is a special kind of [[category]], a bottom is simply an [[initial object]] in that category.

The bottom of the poset of [[subset]]s or [[subobject]]s of a given set or object $A$ is called the [[empty set|empty]] subset or subobject.  In a category (such as [[Set]]) with a strict [[initial object]] $\varnothing$, this will always serve as the bottom of any subobject poset.
