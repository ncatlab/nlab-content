The term _cartesian category_ can mean either of

* [[cartesian monoidal category]]
* [[finitely complete category]]

The first of these is the traditional meaning, while the second is advocated in the [[Elephant]].  It is probably best to avoid the ambiguous term.


Compare [[locally cartesian category]], which is unambiguous.
