## Idea

A [[long exact sequence in cohomology]] induced by a [[spherical fibration]]. A corollary of the [[Serre spectral sequence]]:

## Statement

Let $R$ be a [[commutative ring]] and let

$$
  \array{
    S^n &\longrightarrow& E
    \\
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\pi}}
    \\
    && B
  }
$$

be a [[fiber bundle]] of [[n-spheres]] over a [[simply connected topological space|simply connected]] [[simplicial complex]]. 

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

There exists a [[Thom class]]  $c \in H^{n+1}(E; R)$ (in the [[ordinary cohomology]] of the total space with [[coefficients]] in $R$) such that the [[cup product]] operation $c \cup (-)$ sits in a [[long exact sequence]] of [[cohomology groups]] of the form

$$
  \cdots 
   \to 
   H^k(B; R) 
     \stackrel{\pi^\ast}{\longrightarrow}
   H^k(E; R)
    \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}
   H^{k-n}(B;R)
   \stackrel{c \cup (-)}{\longrightarrow}
   H^{k+1}(B; R)
   \to
   \cdots
  \,.
$$

(e.g. [Kochmann 96, corollary 2.2.6](#Kochmann96))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

There is the corresponding [[Serre spectral sequence]] 

$$
  E_2^{s,t}
  =
  H^s(B; H^t(S^n;R))
  \;\Rightarrow\;
  H^{s+t}(E; R)
  \,.
$$

Since the [[ordinary cohomology]] of the [[n-sphere]] [[fiber]] is concentrated in just two degees

$$
  H^t(S^n; R)
  =
  \left\{
    \array{
      R & for \; t= 0 \; and \; t = n
      \\
      0 & otherwise
    }
  \right.
$$

most terms on the $E_2$ page of this spectral sequence, and hence on all the further pages, vanish. As a consequence, the only possible non-vanishing differentials $d_r$ are those on the $(n+1)$-page, of the form

$$
  \array{
     E_{n+1}^{s,n} & \simeq & H^s(B;R)
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{d_{n+1}}}\downarrow
     \\
     E_{n+1}^{s+n+1,0} & \simeq &  H^{s+n+1}(B;R)
  }
  \,.
$$

Now since the [[coefficients]] $R$ is a [[ring]], the [[Serre spectral sequence]] is multiplicative under [[cup product]] and the [[differential]] is a [[derivation]] (of total degree 1) with respect to this product.

To make use of this, write

$$
  \iota = 1 \in H^0(B;R) \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} E_{n+1}^{0,n} 
$$

for the unit in the cup product ring $H^\bullet(X;R)$, regarded as an element in the $(n+1)$-page of the spectral sequence. Notice that as such $\iota$ is not in degree 0, but in bidegree $(0,n)$, in particular $\iota$ is _not_ in $E_{n+1}^{0,0}$ and in particular is not the unit in there, and hence $d_{n+1}(\iota)$ need not vanish. Write

$$
  c \coloneqq d_{n+1}(\iota) \in E_{n+1}^{n+1,0} \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} H^{n+1}(B; R)
$$

for this element. This is the Thom class in question.

Because, notice that every element in $E_{n+1}^{\bullet,n}$ is of the form $\iota \cdot b$ for $b\in E_{n+1}^{\bullet,0} \simeq H^\bullet(B;R)$, and since $d_{n+1}$ is a [[derivation]] and vanishes on $E_{n+1}^{\bullet,0}$, it follows that its action is fixed by 

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    d_{n+1}(\iota \cdot b)
    & =
    d_{n+1}(\iota) \cdot b + (-1)^{n} \iota \cdot \underset{= 0}{\underbrace{d_{n+1}(b)}}
    \\
    & = c \cdot b
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

This shows that 

$$
  \array{
     E_{n+1}^{s,n} & \simeq & H^s(B;R)
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{d_{n+1}}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{c \cup (-)}}
     \\
     E_{n+1}^{s+n+1, 0} & \simeq & H^{s+n+1}(B;R)
  }
  \,.
$$

Hence the non-vanishing entries of the $E_\infty$-page of the spectral sequence sit in [[exact sequences]] like so

$$
  \array{
     0
     \\
     \downarrow
     \\
     E_\infty^{s,n}
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{ker(d_{n+1})}}\downarrow
     \\
     E_{n+1}^{s,n} & \simeq & H^s(B;R)
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{d_{n+1}}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{c \cup (-)}}
     \\
     E_{n+1}^{s+n+1, 0} & \simeq & H^{s+n+1}(B;R)
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{coker}(d_{n+1})}\downarrow
     \\
     E_\infty^{s+n+1,0}
     \\
     \downarrow
     \\
     0
  }  
  \,.
$$

Moreover, by the convergence of the [[Serre spectral sequence]], there are [[short exact sequences]] of the form

$$
  \array{
     0 && && 0
     \\
     \downarrow && && \downarrow
     \\
     E_\infty^{s,0} &&  \simeq &&  F^s H^s(E; R)
     \\
     \downarrow && && \downarrow
     \\
     H^s(E; R) && = && H^s(E; R)
     \\
     \downarrow && && \downarrow
     \\
     E_\infty^{s-n,n} 
       & \simeq & 
     \frac{F^{s-n}H^s(E;R)}{F^{s-n+1}H^s(E;R)} 
       & \simeq &
     \frac{H^s(E;R)}{F^s H^s(E;R)}
     \\
     \downarrow && && \downarrow
     \\
     0 && && 0
  }
  \,.
$$

Concatenating these two collections of exact sequences yields the [[long exact sequence]] in question.
