Momentum is, according to [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], the 'amount of motion' in an object.  For particles it is  proportional to the object\'s [[mass]] and to its [[velocity]], and thus measured in units of mass times velocity. For photons it is proportional to the frequency of the photon. 

In classical mechanics (including the relativistic mechanics) to every (generalized) coordinate $q_i$ one associates a (generalized) momentum 

$$
p_i = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \stackrel\cdot{q}_i}
$$

where $L$ is the [[Lagrangean]] of the system.

Momentum of a point particle in Newton mechanics is often *defined* as its [[mass]] times [[velocity]] (provided the energy is of the "natural" form kinetic term plus potential depending only on coordinate). 

However, this breaks down in some situations:

*  Relativistically, the velocity factor is more complicated (tending to $\infty$ as velocity tends to the [[speed of light]]).

Zoran: still with rescaled mass the space-components of the momentum are mass times velocity. Of course one can talk about 4-momentum as well but this is a different issue. 

*  In the presence of velocity-dependent forces (notably those produced by a [[magnetic field]]), there is an additional position-dependent term.
*  In nonlinear coordinates (such as for [[angular momentum]]), one not only needs to use a nonlinear velocity (such as [[angular velocity]]) but also replace mass with something more complicated (such as [[moment of inertia]]) which is often position-dependent.

In [[Hamiltonian mechanics]], the momentum coordinates are one of the basic coordinates on [[phase space]]. 

Zoran: there is no a priori way in general to tell which ones are momentum coordinates. There is no way to tell. This depends on choice of coordinates. Phase space is a symplectic manifold and you can make a canonical transformation where momenta become positions and positions minus momenta and the same equations of motion. IF THE SPACE IS TRANSLATION HOMOGENEUOUS then the momenta conjugate to the positions in that space are the conserved quantities. So in this sense in that special case, the "usual" momenta are distinguished.


 In [[Lagrangean mechanics]], momentum is derived, as the partial derivative of the [[Lagrangean]] with respect to [[position]] $q$, or as the coefficient on $\mathrm{d}q$ in the [[action functional|action form]].

In [[quantum mechanics]], the [[canonical quantization]] process formally replaces momentum by $-i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial x},$ where $x$ is position.  (Equivalently, in [[momentum space]], canonical quantization replaces $x$ by $i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial p}.)$  In this situation, position and momentum [fail to commute](canonical+commutation+relation).
