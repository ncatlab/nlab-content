# Idea #

The _homotopy groups_ $\pi_n(X,a)$ of a [[pointed object|pointed]] space $(X,a)$ are a sequence of [[group]]s that generalise the [[fundamental group]] $\pi_1(X,a)$ to higher homotopies.

Actually, $\pi_0(X,a)$ is not a group at all but merely a [[pointed set]].  Conversely, $\pi_2(X,a)$ and above are all [[abelian group]]s.  Only $\pi_1(X,a)$ may be an arbitrary group.  In general, $\pi_n(X,a)$ is an $n$-[[k-tuply groupal n-groupoid|tuply groupal]] set.

Lower homotopy groups act on higher homotopy groups; the nonabelian group cohomology of this gives the Postnikov invariants of the space.  All of this data put together allows one to reconstruct the original space, at least up to weak [[homotopy type]], through its [[Postnikov system]].

# Definition #

Let $S^n$ be the pointed $n$-[[sphere]], that is an $n$-dimensional real sphere equipped with any basepoint.  The underlying set of $\pi_n(X,a)$ will be the set of basepoint-preserving continuous maps from $S^n$ to $(X,a)$, with such maps identified if there is a basepoint-preserving [[homotopy]] between them.  Now we will put some structure on that set.

First, the [[constant function]] that maps all of $S^n$ to $a$ is the __null element__ of $\pi_n(X,a)$.  Now, there are $n$ independent equators through the basepoint of $S^n$.  Given two maps $f, g: S^n \to (X,a)$, form their [[coproduct|copairing]] in the category of pointed spaces to get a map $S^n \vee S^n \to (X,a)$ (where $\vee$ indicates the [[wedge sum]]); then combine this with a map $S^n \to S^n \vee S^n$ that maps the $i$th equator to the basepoint and each hemisphere to one copy of the sphere.  The result is a map $S^n \to (X,a)$, called the $i$th __concatenation__ of $f$ and $g$:
$$S^n \to_i S^n \vee S^n \to^{[f,g]} (X,a)$$
One can check that this operation respects homotopy equivalence.

This seems like quite a complicated kind of structure, but it is actually quite simple up to homotopy.  First of all, all $n$ concatenations of given maps $f$ and $g$ are homotopic, so we speak of simply a single __concatenation__ for $n \geq 1$ (and none for $n = 0$).  By the [[Eckmann-Hilton argument]], this concatenation will be commutative up to homotopy for $n \geq 2$.  In any case, it is associative and invertible up to homotopy, and the null element is an identity up to homotopy.

The result is that the set $\pi_n(X,a)$ of equivalence classes is an abelian group for $n \geq 2$, a group for $n = 1$, and a pointed set for $n = 0$ (when the null element is the only structure).

Note that $\pi_0(X,a)$ can be identified with the set of all [[path component]]s of $X$, with the component containing $a$ as the basepoint.  It is common to write simply $\pi_0(X)$ for the set of all path components without a chosen basepoint, although this is more properly called the [[fundamental infinity-groupoid|fundamental 0-groupoid]] of $X$.


# History #

In the early years of the 20th century it was known that the nonabelian fundamental group $\pi_1(X,a)$ of a space $X$ with base point $a$ was useful in geometry and complex analysis. It was also known that the abelian [[homology group]]s $H_n(X)$ existed for all $n \geq 0$ and that if $X$ is connected then $H_1(X)$ is isomorphic to the abelianisation of any $\pi_1(X,a)$. 

Consequently it was hoped to generalise the fundamental group to higher dimensions, producing nonabelian groups whose abelianisations would be the homology groups.

In 1932, E. ÄŒech proposed a definition of higher homotopy groups using maps of spheres, but the paper was rejected for the Zurich ICM since it was found that these groups $\pi_n(X,a)$ were abelian for $n \geq 2$, and so do not generalise the fundamental group in the way that was originally desired.  Nonetheless, they have proved to be extremely important in homotopy theory, although more difficult to compute in general than homology groups.  See [[weak homotopy equivalence]].


# Properties #

It was early realised that the fundamental groupoid $\pi_1(X,a)$ operates on the family of groups $\{\pi_n(X,a) | a \in X\}$ which should thus together be regarded as a module over $\pi_1(X,a)$.

A key property of homotopy groups is the _Whitehead theorem_: if $f:X \to Y$ is a map of connected [[m-cofibrant space]]s (spaces each of the homotopy type of a [[CW complex]]), and $f$ induces isomorphisms $\pi_n(X,a) \to \pi_n(Y,f(a))$ for some $a$ and all $n \geq 1$, then $f$ is a [[homotopy equivalence]].

However, the homotopy groups by themselves, even considering the operations of $\pi_1$, do not characterise homotopy types. See also [[algebraic homotopy|algebraic homotopy theory]].

But the entire Postnikov tower does characterise weak homotopy types, does it not? (Actually, I shouldn\'t really phrase it that way, since the Postnikov tower as such is a sequence of maps that begins with the space in question.  I mean the homotopy groups together with the Postnikov invariants.) ---Toby

[[Tim Porter|Tim]]:  The Postnikov tower of a space does characterise the weak homotopy type of the space as that is the inverse limit of the tower.  The point is not that however. The homotopy groups plus the 'primary' operations (which include the action of $\pi_1$ and the Whitehead products) still do not determine the weak homotopy type.
One of the experts on this is David Blanc, see for instance
http://arxiv.org/abs/math.AT/9803055. He uses a notion of $\pi$-algebra which encodes the groups, the primary operations, (I think that is all) and then searches for obstructions to realising such a system by a homotopy type.
