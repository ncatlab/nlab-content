The _homotopy groups_ $\pi_n(X,a)$ of a [[pointed object|pointed]] space $(X,a)$ are a sequence of [[group]]s that generalise the [[fundamental group]] $\pi_1(X,a)$ to higher homotopies.

Actually, $\pi_0(X,a)$ is not a group at all but merely a [[pointed set]].  Conversely, $\pi_2(X,a)$ and above are all [[abelian group]]s.  Only $\pi_1(X,a)$ may be a arbitrary group.

Lower homotopy groups act on higher homotopy groups; all of this data put together comprises the [[Postnikov tower]] of $(X,a)$, which characterises the (weak) [[homotopy type]] of $(X,a)$.
