
The [[motive]]s in algebraic geometry can be adapted to derived noncommutative geometry. Such a theory has been developed by [[Maxim Kontsevich]]. There is a remarkable observation that the category of Chow motives can be after localizing at the Lefschetz motive can be embedded into the category of noncommutative motives. More recently this direction has been systematically studied by Cisinski and Tabuada. 

There is another approach by [[Arne Ostvaer]].

In noncommutative geometry a la Connes, Connes and Marcolli have also introduced some motivic ideas. Marcolli also has most recent collaboration with Tabuada on the algebraic side.
