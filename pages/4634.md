## Idea

The notion of [[motives]] in algebraic geometry can be adapted to derived [[noncommutative geometry]]. The idea and the first version has been developed by [[Maxim Kontsevich]]. There is a remarkable observation that the [[category of Chow motives]] (after localizing at the [[Lefschetz motive]]) can be embedded into the category of Kontsevich's noncommutative motives. More recently this direction has been systematically studied by Cisinski and Tabuada. 

There is another approach by [[Arne Ostvaer]].

In [[noncommutative geometry]] a la [[Alain Connes]], Connes and [[Matilde Marcolli]] have also introduced some motivic ideas. Marcolli also has most recent collaboration with Tabuada on the algebraic side.

## Definition 
 {#Definition}

The definition in ([Blumberg-Gepner-Tabuada 10](#BlumbergGepnerTabuada10)) is the following.



Write $Cat_\infty^{stab}$ for the [[(infinity,1)-category]] of [[stable (infinity,1)-categories]].

###### Definition

Say that 

* a [[Morita equivalence]] is a map in $Cat_\infty^{stab}$ which becomes an [[equivalence of (infinity,1)-categories]] under [[idempotent complete (infinity,1)-category|idempotent completion]];

* a sequence in $Cat_\infty^{stab}$ is (split-)exact if it is so in the standard sense under idempotent completion;

* a functor $Cat_\infty^{stab} \to \mathcal{D}$ to a stable [[presentable (infinity,1)-category]] is an **additive invariant** if it

  1. inverts Morita equivalences;

  1. preserves [[filtered (infinity,1)-colimits]];

  1. sends (split-)exact sequences to (split) [[homotopy cofiber sequences]].

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition


The $(\infty,1)$-category $Mot_{add}$ of **noncommutative motives** is the [[universal construction|universal]] additive invariant

$$
  Cat_\infty^{stab} \to Mot_{add}
  \,.
$$

###### Definition

The localization property here (be additive, invert Morita, preserve split sequences) is of the same form as that which defines the localization of [[C*-algebras]] to [[KK-theory]] in [[noncommutative stable homotopy theory]]. See at _[KK-theory -- Universal characterization](KK-theory#UniversalCharacterization)_. See also ([Blumberg-Gepner-Tabuada 10, paragraph 1.5](#BlumbergGepnerTabuada10)).

## Properties

The relation between ordinary [[Chow motives]] and noncommutative Chow motives is recalled as theorem 4.6 in ([Tabuada 11](#Tabuada11)). For more see [Tabuada 11 ChowNCG](#Tabuada11Chow)
