## Idea

The notion of [[motives]] in algebraic geometry can be adapted to derived [[noncommutative geometry]]. Such a theory has been developed by [[Maxim Kontsevich]]. There is a remarkable observation that the [[category of Chow motives]] (after localizing at the [[Lefschetz motive]]) can be embedded into the category of noncommutative motives. More recently this direction has been systematically studied by Cisinski and Tabuada. 

There is another approach by [[Arne Ostvaer]].

In [[noncommutative geometry]] a la [[Alain Connes]], Connes and [[Matilde Marcolli]] have also introduced some motivic ideas. Marcolli also has most recent collaboration with Tabuada on the algebraic side.


## Properties

The relation between ordinary [[Chow motives]] and noncommutative Chow motives is recalled as theorem 4.6 in ([Tabuada 11](#Tabuada11)). For more see [Tabuada 11 ChowNCG](#Tabuada11Chow)
