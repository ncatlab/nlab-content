## Idea

The notion of [[motives]] in algebraic geometry can be adapted to derived [[noncommutative geometry]]. The idea and the first version has been developed by [[Maxim Kontsevich]]. There is a remarkable observation that the [[category of Chow motives]] (after localizing at the [[Lefschetz motive]]) can be embedded into the category of Kontsevich's noncommutative motives. More recently this direction has been systematically studied by Cisinski and Tabuada. 

There is another approach by [[Arne Ostvaer]].

In [[noncommutative geometry]] a la [[Alain Connes]], Connes and [[Matilde Marcolli]] have also introduced some motivic ideas. Marcolli also has most recent collaboration with Tabuada on the algebraic side.

## Definition 
 {#Definition}

The definition in ([Blumberg-Gepner-Tabuada 10](#BlumbergGepnerTabuada10)) is the following.



Write $Cat_\infty^{stab}$ for the [[(∞,1)-category]] of [[stable (∞,1)-categories]]. 

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

Say that 

* a [[Morita equivalence]] is a map in $Cat_\infty^{stab}$ which becomes an [[equivalence of (∞,1)-categories]] under [[idempotent complete (∞,1)-category|idempotent completion]];

* a sequence in $Cat_\infty^{stab}$ is (split-)exact if it is so in the standard sense under idempotent completion;

* a functor $Cat_\infty^{stab} \to \mathcal{D}$ to a stable [[presentable (∞,1)-category]] is an **additive invariant** or **localizing invariant** if it

  1. inverts Morita equivalences;

  1. preserves [[filtered (∞,1)-colimits]];

  1. sends split exact sequences or exact sequences, respectively, to (split) [[homotopy cofiber sequences]].

+-- {: .num_defn #BGTCharacterization}
###### Definition


The $(\infty,1)$-category $Mot_{add}$ or $Mot_{loc}$, respectively, of **noncommutative motives** is the [[universal construction|universal]] additive/localizing invariant

$$
  \mathcal{U}_{add} \colon Cat_\infty^{stab} \to Mot_{add}
$$

$$
  \mathcal{U}_{loc} \colon Cat_\infty^{stab} \to Mot_{loc}
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

The localization property here (be additive, invert Morita, preserve split sequences) is of the same form as that which defines the localization of [[C*-algebras]] to [[KK-theory]] in [[noncommutative stable homotopy theory]]. See at _[KK-theory -- Universal characterization](KK-theory#UniversalCharacterization)_. See also ([Blumberg-Gepner-Tabuada 10, paragraph 1.5](#BlumbergGepnerTabuada10)).

###### Theorem

For $\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B} \in Cat_\infty^{stab}$ with $\mathcal{B}$ smooth and proper, hence a [[compact object in an (infinity,1)-category|compact object]], then the hom-[[spectrum]] in $Mot_{loc}$ between $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ is given by the [[non-connective algebraic K-theory]] $\mathbb{K}$ of the tensor product in that there is a [[natural equivalence]]

$$
  Hom_{Mot_{loc}}(\mathcal{U}_{loc}(\mathcal{B}), \mathcal{U}_{loc}(\mathcal{K}))
  \simeq
  \mathbb{K}(\mathcal{B}^{op}\widehat \otimes \mathcal{A})
  \,.

### Inclusion of Chow motives

The relation between ordinary [[Chow motives]] and noncommutative Chow motives is recalled as theorem 4.6 in ([Tabuada 11](#Tabuada11)). For more see [Tabuada 11 ChowNCG](#Tabuada11Chow)
