## Idea

The notion of [[motives]] in algebraic geometry can be adapted to derived [[noncommutative geometry]]. The idea and the first version has been developed by [[Maxim Kontsevich]]. There is a remarkable observation that the [[category of Chow motives]] (after localizing at the [[Lefschetz motive]]) can be embedded into the category of Kontsevich's noncommutative motives. More recently this direction has been systematically studied by Cisinski and Tabuada. 

A second approach is due to [[Bertrand Toën]], [[Michel Vaquié]], [[Gabriele Vezzosi]].  They construct a [[motivic stable homotopy theory]] for [[noncommutative geometry|noncommutative spaces]] (in the sense of [[Kontsevich]]).

There is another approach by [[Arne Ostvaer]].

In [[noncommutative geometry]] à la [[Alain Connes]], Connes and [[Matilde Marcolli]] have also introduced some motivic ideas. Marcolli also has a  recent collaboration with Tabuada on the algebraic side, see her [[Matilde Marcolli|webpage]].

## Definition 
 {#Definition}

### As the universal additive/localizing invariant
 {#AsUniversalAditiveInvariant}

The definition in ([Blumberg-Gepner-Tabuada 10](#BlumbergGepnerTabuada10)) is the following.



Write $Cat_\infty^{stab}$ for the [[(∞,1)-category]] of [[stable (∞,1)-categories]]. 

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

Say that 

* a [[Morita equivalence]] is a map in $Cat_\infty^{stab}$ which becomes an [[equivalence of (∞,1)-categories]] under [[idempotent complete (∞,1)-category|idempotent completion]];

* a sequence in $Cat_\infty^{stab}$ is (split-)exact if it is so in the standard sense under idempotent completion;

* a functor $Cat_\infty^{stab} \to \mathcal{D}$ to a stable [[presentable (∞,1)-category]] is an **additive invariant** or **localizing invariant** if it

  1. inverts Morita equivalences;

  1. preserves [[filtered (∞,1)-colimits]];

  1. sends split exact sequences or exact sequences, respectively, to (split) [[homotopy cofiber sequences]]. 

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #BGTCharacterization}
###### Definition


The $(\infty,1)$-category $Mot_{add}$ or $Mot_{loc}$, respectively, of **noncommutative motives** is the [[universal construction|universal]] additive/localizing invariant

$$
  \mathcal{U}_{add} \colon Cat_\infty^{stab} \to Mot_{add}
$$

$$
  \mathcal{U}_{loc} \colon Cat_\infty^{stab} \to Mot_{loc}
  \,.
$$

([Blumberg-Gepner-Tabuada 10, theorem 1.1, section 8](#BlumbergGepnerTabuada10))

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

The localization property here (be additive, invert Morita, preserve split sequences) is of the same form as that which defines the localization of [[C*-algebras]] to [[KK-theory]] in [[noncommutative stable homotopy theory]]. See at _[KK-theory -- Universal characterization](KK-theory#UniversalCharacterization)_. See also ([Blumberg-Gepner-Tabuada 10, paragraph 1.5](#BlumbergGepnerTabuada10)).

## Properties

### Relation to algebraic K-theory
 {#RelationToAlgebraicKTheory}

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Theorem

For $\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B} \in Cat_\infty^{stab}$ with $\mathcal{B}$ smooth and proper, hence a [[compact object in an (infinity,1)-category|compact object]], then the hom-[[spectrum]] in $Mot_{loc}$ between $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ is given by the [[non-connective algebraic K-theory]] $\mathbb{K}$ of the tensor product in that there is a [[natural equivalence]]

$$
  Hom_{Mot_{loc}}(\mathcal{U}_{loc}(\mathcal{B}), \mathcal{U}_{loc}(\mathcal{K}))
  \simeq
  \mathbb{K}(\mathcal{B}^{op}\widehat \otimes \mathcal{A})
  \,.
$$

=--

([Blumberg-Gepner-Tabuada 10](#BlumbergGepnerTabuada10), theorem 9.36)

### Relation to correspondences equipped with cocycles
 {#RelationToCorrespondences}

By ([Blumberg-Gepner-Tabuada 10, theorem 9.36](#BlumbergGepnerTabuada10)), the morphisms of noncommutative motives from $\mathcal{A}$ to $\mathcal{B}$ for $\mathcal{B}$ suitably dualizable/compact are given by 

$$
  Maps(\mathcal{U}_{loc}(\mathcal{B}), \mathcal{U}_{loc}(\mathcal{A}))
  \simeq
   \mathbb{K}(\mathcal{B}^{op}\otimes\mathcal{A})
  \,,
$$

hence by the [[non-connective algebraic K-theory]] of the [[Deligne tensor product]] of the two categories. 

Thinking of these as categories of [[quasicoherent sheaves]] on some spaces (by definition in [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]]), this are $\mathbb{K}$-cocycles on the product [[correspondence]] space.

(...)

### Relation to Chow motives
 {#RelationToChowMotives}

The category of ordinary [[Chow motives]], after factoizing out the actiojn of the [[Tate motive]] essentially sits inside that of noncommutative Chow motives. This is recalled as  ([Tabuada 11, theorem 4.6](#Tabuada11)). For more see ([Tabuada 11 ChowNCG](#Tabuada11Chow)).

This relation is best understood as being exhibited by [[K-motives]], see there.

### Relation to KK-theory

Noncommutative motives receive a universal functor from [[KK-theory]]

$$
  KK \longrightarrow NCC_{dg}
$$

which is given by sending a [[C*-algebra]] to the [[dg-category]] of [[perfect complexes]] over (the [[unitalization]] of) its underlying [[associative algebra]] ([Mahanta 13](#Mahanta13)).

## Applications

* [[Tabuada]] has used noncommutative motives to compute the [[cyclic homology]] of [[twisted projective homogeneous varieties]].  Also, he showed that the noncommutative motive of such a variety is trivial if and only if the [[Brauer class|Brauer classes]] of the associated [[central simple algebras]] are trivial.  See ([Tabuada 13](#Tabuada13Twisted)).

* Bernardara and Tabuada have used noncommutative motives to compute the rational [[Chow groups]] of certain complete [[intersections]] of [[curves]].  See ([Bernardara-Tabuada 13](#BerTab13)).

it is shown that there is a universal functor $KK \longrightarrow NCC_{dg}$ from [[KK-theory]] to the category of [[noncommutative motives]], which is the category of [[dg-categories]] and dg-[[profunctors]] up to homotopy between them. This is given by sending a [[C*-algebra]] to the [[dg-category]] of [[perfect complexes]] of (the unitalization of) its underlying [[associative algebra]].
