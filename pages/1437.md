A terminal coalgebra, also called final coalgebra, for an endofunctor $F$ on a category $C$ is a [[terminal object]] in the category of [[coalgebra|coalgebras]] of $F$.

If $F$ has a terminal coalgebra, $\alpha: X \to F(X)$, then $X$ is isomorphic to $F(X)$ (see proof at 'Terminal (final) coalgebras' of [[coalgebra]]).

$X$ is a largest 'fixed point' of $F$.

The dual concept is [[initial algebra]].
