## Definition

A  _biholomorphic function_ is a [[holomorphic function]] which is a [[bijection]] on the underlying [[sets]] and whose set-theoretic [[inverse]] is also holomorphic.

## Properties

### Between complex manifolds

Any non-constant [[surjection|surjective]] [[holomorphic map]] between [[connected topological space|connected]] [[compact topological space|compact]] [[complex manifolds]] of equal [[dimension]] is a ramified finite-sheet [[covering space|covering]]. If this map is in particular [[bijection|bijective]], then there is only one sheet, and thus it is a biholomorphism.
