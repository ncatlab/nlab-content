## Definition

A _biholomorphic function_ is a [[holomorphic function]] which is a [[bijection]] on the underlying sets and whose set-theoretic inverse is also holomorphic.

## Properties

If $f:U\to V$ is a bijective holomorphic map of open subsets of complexfied [[Cartesian space]] ${\mathbb{C}}^n$, then the [[determinant]] of the [[Jacobian]] $J(f)$ is nowhere $0$, that is $f^{-1}$ is holomorphic.
