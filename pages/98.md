## Ordinary concept

Chevalley–Eilenberg algebras are differential graded commutative algebras which are used to define cohomology of Lie algebras. 

## Definition 

Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a finite-dimensional [[Lie algebra]] (i.e., an ordinary Lie algebra object in $Vect$), with underlying vector space $U\mathfrak{g}$. The Lie bracket is an alternating bilinear operation, hence defines a linear map 

$$[-, -]: U\mathfrak{g} \wedge U\mathfrak{g} \to U\mathfrak{g}$$

The linear transpose defines a linear map $d_1: U\mathfrak{g}^* \to U\mathfrak{g}^* \wedge U\mathfrak{g}^*$. 

Let $U\mathfrak{g}^*[1]$ denote the graded vector space whose only nonzero component is $U\mathfrak{g}^*$ concentrated in degree 1. The free commutative graded algebra $S(U\mathfrak{g}^*[1])$ on this graded vector space is given by the [[exterior algebra]], whose component in degree $k$ is the $k^{th}$ exterior power $\Lambda^k U\mathfrak{g}$. The map $d_1$ gives a degree 1 map 

$$d: U\mathfrak{g}^*[1] \to S(U\mathfrak{g}^*[1])$$ 

which in turn, by freeness, extends uniquely to a degree 1 [[derivation]] on the free commutative algebra, which we again call $d$. The Jacobi identity on $\mathfrak{g}$ is equivalent to the statement that $d^2 = 0$, hence we have defined a [[dg-algebra]]. This is the **Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra** (or CE-algebra) of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$.

## Generalization in $\infty$-context

In the context of general [[Lie theory]] one notices that Chevalley–Eilenberg algebras generalized to arbitrary "quasi-free differential graded commutative algebras" are usefully thought of as providing a language that naturally allows to pass from Lie algebras to $L_\infty$-[[Lie infinity-algebroid|algebroid]]s: Chevalley–Eilenberg algebras are taken in this context to be the algebras of functions on [[NQ-supermanifolds]].

Closely related are [[Weil algebra]]s, which are the algebras of functions on the shifted tangent bundles of these [[NQ-supermanifolds]].


## Appearance in physics

In the physics literature Chevalley–Eilenberg algebras of $L_\infty$-[[Lie infinity-algebroid|algebroid]]s are addressed as [[BRST complexes]].

In this context

* the generators in degree 0 are called **fields**;

* the generators in degree $1$ are called **ghosts**;

* the generators in degree $2$ are called **ghosts of ghosts**;

* etc.
