In the strict sense of the word, the String Lie 2-algebra $\mathfrak{string}(n)$ is a shifted [[L-infinity-algebra|∞-Lie algebra]] central extension

$$
  0 \to b \mathfrak{u}(1) \to \mathfrak{string}(n)
  \to \mathfrak{so}(n) \to 0
$$

of the [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{so}(n)$ by the [[L-infinity-algebra|Lie 2-algebra]] $b \mathfrak{u}(1)$.

This central extension is controled by the canonical (up to normalition) [[Lie algebra cohomology|Lie algebra 3-cocycle]] $\mu$ on $\mathfrak{so}(n)$.

When $\mu$ is normalized such that it represents the image in [[deRham cohomology]] of the generator of the [[integral cohomology]] $H^3(X,Spin(n))$ then the corresponding String Lie 2-algebra is the Lie 2-algebra of the [[String Lie 2-group]].

More generally, for $\mathfrak{g}$ an [[L-infinity-algebra|∞-Lie algebra]] and $\mu \in CE(\mathfrak{g})$ an $\infty$-Lie algebra cocycle (a closed element in the [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] of $\mathfrak{k}$) of degree $k$, there is a corresponding shifted central extension

$$
  0 \to b^{k-2} \mathfrak{u}(1) \to \mathfrak{g}_\mu  \to \mathfrak{g} \to 0
  \,.
$$

For instance the [[supergravity Lie 3-algebra]] is such an extension of the [[super Poincare Lie algebra]] by a [[super Lie algebra]] 4-cocycle.

#References#

In one incarnation or other the String Lie 2-algebra has been considered in literature of [[dg-algebra]]s, but its [[Lie theory|Lie theoretic]] interpretation as a Lie 2-algebra has been made fully explicit only in

* [[John Baez]], [[Alissa Crans]], _Lie 2-algebras_ .

After its relation to the [[String Lie 2-group]] under [[Lie integration]] was established by  in

* Andr&eacute; Henriques, _Integrating $L_\infty$-algebras_

and 

* Crans, Baez, Schreiber, Stevenson, _From loop groups to 2-groups_, 

it was reconsidered in a wider $\infty$-Lie theoretic context in 

* Sati, Schreiber, Stasheff, _$L_\infty$-algebra connections_

where also the relation to the [[supergravity Lie 3-algebra]] and other structures is discussed.
