## Definition

A **K3 surface** is a [[Calabi-Yau variety]] of [[dimension]] $2$. This means that the [[canonical bundle]] $\omega_X=\wedge^2\Omega_X\simeq \mathcal{O}_X$ is trivial and $H^1(X, \mathcal{O}_X)=0$.

## Examples

* A cyclic cover $\mathbb{P}^2$ branched over a curve of degree $6$

* A nonsingular degree $4$ hypersurface in $\mathbb{P}^3$.


## Basic Properties

* All K3 surfaces are [[simply connected]]. 

* The [[Hodge diamond]] is completely determined (even in positive [[characteristic]]) and hence the 
  [[Hodge-de Rham spectral sequence]] degenerates at $E_1$. This also implies that the [[Betti numbers]] are completely determined as $1, 0, 22, 0, 1$. 

* Over the [[complex numbers]] they are all [[Kähler manifold|Kähler]].
