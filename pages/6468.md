## Definition

A **K3 surface** is a [[Calabi-Yau variety]] of dimension $2$. This means that the [[canonical bundle]] $\omega_X=\wedge^2\Omega_X\simeq \mathcal{O}_X$ is trivial and $H^1(X, \mathcal{O}_X)=0$.

## Examples

* A cyclic cover $\mathbb{P}^2$ branched over a curve of degree $6$

* A nonsingular degree $4$ hypersurface in $\mathbb{P}^3$.


## Basic Properties

* All K3 surfaces are [[simply connected]]. 

* The Hodge diamond is completely determined (even in positive characteristic) and hence the Hodge-de Rham spectral sequence degenerates at $E_1$. This also implies that the Betti numbers are completely determined as $1, 0, 22, 0, 1$. 

* Over the complex numbers they are all [[Kahler manifold|Kahler]].
