## Idea

The 2-[[sphere]] with its standard [[volume form]] is canonically a [[Poisson manifold]] and in fact a [[symplectic manifold]]. As such it may be regarded as a simple example of a [[phase space]] of a [[mechanical system]]. The [[quantization]] of this system yields the corresponding [[quantum mechanical system]]. This turns out to be that of the degrees of freedom of a [[rotor]] or [[spinor]] in 3-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] (just the "internal" rotor/spin degrees of freedom, no translational motion).

## Formalizations

* in [[geometric quantization]]: [[geometric quantization of the 2-sphere]]

* in [[deformation quantization]]: [[deformation quantization of the 2-sphere]]
