## Idea

The "classical homotopy category" $Ho(Top)$ typically refers to the [[category]] of [[topological spaces]] with morphisms between them the [[homotopy classes]] of [[continuous functions]], or (slightly less classically but more commonly these days) to its [[full subcategory]] on those topological spaces [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to a [[CW-complex]]. The latter is technically the [[homotopy category]] obtained by [[localization|localizing]] the category of topological spaces at those [[continuous functions]] that are  [[weak homotopy equivalences]], hence it is also the [[homotopy category of a model category]] of the [[classical model structure on topological spaces]].


## Definition

By $Ho(Top)$ one denotes the [[category]] which is the [[homotopy category]] of [[Top]] with respect to [[category with weak equivalences|weak equivalences]] given 

* either by [[homotopy equivalence]]s -- $Ho(Top)_{he}$.

* or by [[weak homotopy equivalence]]s -- $Ho(Top)_{whe}$.

Depending on context here [[Top]] contains all topological spaces or is some subcategory of [[nice topological space]]s.

The study of $Ho(Top)$ was the motivating example of [[homotopy theory]]. Often $Ho(Top)$ is called _the_ homotopy category.

The [[simplicial localization]] of [[Top]] at the [[weak homotopy equivalences]] yields the [[(∞,1)-category]] of [[∞-groupoids]]/[[homotopy types]].

## Compactly generated spaces

Let now $Top$ denote concretely the category of [[compactly generated space|compactly generated]] [[weakly Hausdorff space]]s. And Let $CW$ be the subcategory on [[CW-complex]]es. We have $Ho(CW)_{whe} = Ho(CW)_{he} = Ho(CW)$.

There is a functor

$$
  Top \to Ho(CW)
$$

that sends each topological space to a weakly homotopy equivalent CW-complex.

By the [[homotopy hypothesis]]-theorem $Ho(CW)$ is equivalent for instance to the [[homotopy category of a model category]] $Ho(sSet_{Quillen})$ of the [[classical model structure on simplicial sets]] as well as $Ho(Top_{Quillen})$of the [[classical model structure on topological spaces]].

## Shape theory

The category $Ho(Top)_{he}$ can be studied by testing its objects with objects from $Ho(CW)$. This is the topic of [[shape theory]].
