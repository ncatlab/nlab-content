In section 6.1.2 of

* [[Jacob Lurie]], [[Higher Topos Theory]]

a notion of [[groupoid]] object [[internalization|internal]] to an [[(infinity,1)-category]] $\mathbf{C}$ is defined
as [[homotopy]]-[[simplicial object]] in $\mathbf{C}$ given by an [[(infinity,1)-functor]]

$$
  C : \Delta^{op} \to \mathbf{C}
$$

satisfying some conditions that make it look like the [[nerve]] of an [[internal category|internal]] [[groupoid]] (proposition 6.2.2.6 in [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT]]).

Such a groupoid object with $C_0 = {*}$ is a group object.

If $C$ is the [[Cech-nerve]] of a morphism $C_0 \to C_{-1}$ then then groupoid object is [[delooping|deloopable]] (called _effective_; the $(\infty,1)$-analog of a [[quotient object]]) and we write

$$
  C_{-1} := \mathbf{B}C
  \,.
$$

In an [[(infinity,1)-topos]] every groupoid object is [[delooping|deloopable]].
