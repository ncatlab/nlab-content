###### Proposition
**(Dieudonné's theorem)**

Every [[paracompact Hausdorff space]] is [[normal Hausdorff space|normal]].

In particular [[compact Hausdorff spaces are normal]].

###### Proof

In one direction, let $(X,\tau)$ be a paracompact Hausdorff space, let $x \in X$ be a point, and let $C \subset X$ be a [[closed subset]] not containing $x$. We need to find disjoint open neighbourhoods $U_x \supset \{x\}$ and $U_C \supset C$.

First of all, by the Hausdorff property there exists for each $c \in C$ disjoint open neighbourhods $U_{x_{c}} \supset \{x\}$ and $U_c \supset \{c\}$. As $c$ ranges, the latter clearly form an open cover $\{U_c \subset X\}_{c \in C}$ of $C$, and so

$$
  \{U_c \subset X\}_{c \in C} \cup X \backslash C
$$

is an open cover of $X$. By paracompactness of $(X,\tau)$, there exists a locally finite refinement of $X$, and by [this lemma](locally+finite+cover#LocallyFiniteRefinementImpliesLocallyFiniteCoverWithOriginalIndexSet) we may assume its elements to share the original index set and be containd in the original elements

$$
 \{V_c \subset U_c \subset  X\}_{c \in C} \cup \{V_{X \backslash C} \subset X\}
  \,.
$$


By intersecting the elements of this refinement with $C$, this yields a locally finite subcover $\{V_j \cap C \subset C\}_{j \in J}$ of $C$.

By definition this means that there exists an open neighbourhood $W_x \supset \{x\}$ and a finite subset $K \subset J$ such $\underset{j \in J \backslash K}{\forall}( W_x \cap (V_j \cap C) = \emptyset )$ while $\underset{j \in K \subset J}{\forall}( W_x \cap (V_j \cap C) \neq \emptyset )$. Hence we may choose points
in these non-empty intersections:

$$
  \left\{
     c_k \in W_x \cap (V_k \cap C)
  \right\}_{k \in K}
  \,.
$$

Consider then 

$$
  U_x 
   \;\coloneqq\;
  W_x 
    \cap 
  \left( 
    \underset{k \in K}{\cap}
     \left(
       U_{x_{(c_k)}}
     \right)
  \right)
$$

and

$$
  U_C
   \;\coloneqq\;
  \underset{i \in I}{\cup} V_{i}
  \,.
$$

These are open neighbourhoods of $\{x\}$ and of $C$, respectively, as they are the finite intersection and union, respectively of open sets. Also these are disjoint,

$$
  U_x \cap U_C = \emptyset
  \,.
$$

This is because only finitely many of the $V_i$ intersect $W$, by local finiteness, and those that do are the $V_{c_k} \subset U_{c_k}$ which by construction are each disjoint from $U_x$.

In the other direction...
