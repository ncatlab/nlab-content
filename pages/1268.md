A _D-module_ is a [[abelian sheaf|sheaf]] of [[module]]s over the [[sheaf]] of regular differential operators (the latter notion depends on whether we work over a scheme, manifold or analytic space etc.). They are useful as a means of applying the methods of [[homological algebra]] and [[Categories and Sheaves|sheaf theory]] to the study of analytic systems of partial differential equations.

#Idea#

In as far as an $O$-modules on a [[ringed site]] $(X, O)$ can be interpreted as a ([[sheaf]] of sections of a) vector bundle on $X$, a D-module can be interpreted as a ([[sheaf]] of sections of a) vector bundle on $X$ _with flat [[connection]]_ $\nabla$: 

the action of the differential operation given by a vector field $v$ on $X$ on a section $\sigma$ of the sheaf (over some patch $U$) is to be thought of as the covariant derivative $\sigma \mapsto \nabla_v \sigma$ with respect to the flat connection $\nabla$.
