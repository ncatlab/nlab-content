## Idea

The idea of a symmetric cloaed midpoint algebra comes from [[Peter Freyd]]. 

## Definition

A __symmetric closed midpoint algebra__ is a [[symmetric cancellative midpoint algebra]] $(M,\vert, \odot, (-)^\bullet)$ with two elements $\bot:M$ and $\top:M$ such that $\bot^\bullet = \top$. 

## Properties

Every symmetric closed midpoint algebra with $\bot = \top$ is [[trivial object|trivial]]. 

## Examples

The [[unit interval]] with $a \vert b \coloneqq \frac{a + b}{2}$, $\odot = \frac{1}{2}$, $a^\bullet = 1 - a$, $\bot = 0$, and $\top = 1$ is an example of a symmetric closed midpoint algebra.
