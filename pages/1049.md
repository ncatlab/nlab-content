A __bimorphism__ is a morphism which is simultenously epic and mono. Such a morphism in general does not need to iso. If very bimorphism in a category if isomorphism we say that the category is [[balanced category|balanced]]. For example, every [[abelian category]] is balanced and the category of sets is balanced.
