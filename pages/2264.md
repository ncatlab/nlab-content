[[!redirects Mal'cev operation]]
A __Mal'cev operation__ on a set $X$ is a ternary operation

$$ t:X\times X\times X\to X,\,\,\,(x,y,z)\mapsto t(x,y,z) $$

which satisfies the identities $t(x,x,z)=z$ and $t(x,z,z)=x$.
An important motivating example is the operation $t$ of a [[heap]]. 

An [[algebraic theory]] $T$ is a __Mal'cev theory__ when $T$ contains a Mal'cev operation. An algebraic theory is Mal'cev iff one of the following equivalent statements is true:

(i) in the category of $T$-algebras, every reflexive relation is an equivalence relation;

(ii) in the category of $T$-algebras, the composite of any two equivalence relations as an equivalence relation;

(iii) in the category of $T$-algebras, the composition of equivalence relations is commutative.

Statement (i) is one of the motivations to introduce the notion of [[Mal'cev category]]. 

A __Mal'cev variety__ is the category of $T$-algebras for a Mal'cev theory $T$.
