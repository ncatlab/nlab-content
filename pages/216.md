## Idea
 {#Idea}

The [[space]] of [[functions]] $\mathcal{C}_1 \to R$ on the [[space]] of [[morphisms]]  $\mathcal{C}_1$ of a [[small category]] $\mathcal{C}_\bullet$ (with [[coefficients]] in some [[ring]] $R$) naturally inherits a [[convolution algebra]] structure from the [[composition]] operation on morphisms. This is called the _category convolution algebra_ or just _category algebra_ for short.

Often this is considered specifically for [[groupoids]] and hence accordingly called _groupoid convolution algebra_ or just _groupoid algebra_ for short. (For one-object [[delooping]] groupoids of [[groups]], groupoid algebras reduce to [[group algebras]].) The [[inverse|inversion operation]] of the groupoid naturally makes its groupoid algebra into a [[star-algebra]] (this is generally the case for category algebras of [[dagger categories]]) and accordingly groupoid algebras play a role in [[C-star-algebra]] theory.

More generally, if the groupoid carries a [[line 2-bundle]] then (in its incarnation as a [[bundle gerbe]]-like transition bundle) the space of morphisms carries a [[line bundle]] (satisfying some compatibility conditions) and one can consider convolution algebras not just of functions, but of [[sections]] of this line bundle. The resulting algebra is called the _twisted groupoid convolution algebra_, twisted by the [[characteristic class]] of the [[line 2-bundle]].

For "bare" categories/groupoids (i.e.: [[internal category|internal]] to [[Set]]) these constructions are canonical. But under mild conditions or else when equipped some suitable extra [[stuff, structure, property|structure]], it generalizes to [[internal categories]]/[[internal groupoids]] in [[geometry|geometric]] contexts, notably in [[topology]] ([[topological groupoids]]) [[differential geometry]] ([[Lie groupoids]]) and [[algebraic geometry]]. In such geometric situations a groupoid algebra is also called a _[[Hopf algebroid]]_ and may be used to _characterize_ the geometric groupoid.

Therefore to some extent one may think of the relation between categories and their category algebras as an incarnation of the [[Isbell duality|general duality]] between [[geometry]] and [[algebra]]. Since category/groupoid algebras are generically non-commutative, this relation identifies groupoids/categories as certain spaces in [[noncommutative geometry]]. From this point of view groupoid convolution algebras have been highlighted and developed notably in ([Connes 94](#Connes094)). Due to this relation the groupoid convolution product is also referred to as a [[star product]] and denoted "$\star$".

Groupoid convolution algebras may also be understood as generalizations of [[matrix algebras]], to which they reduce for the case of the [[pair groupoid]]. In ([Connes 94, 1.1](#Connes094)) it was famously argued that when [[Werner Heisenberg]] (re-)discovered (infinite-dimensional) [[matrix algebras]] as [[algebras of observables]] in [[quantum mechanics]], conceptually he rather considered groupoid convolution algebras. This perspective has since been fully developed: in ([EH 06](#EH)) [[strict deformation quantization]] is given fairly generally by twisted groupoid convolution algebras. See at _[[geometric quantization of symplectic groupoids]]_ for more on this. For the [[discrete groupoid|discrete]] but [[higher geometry]] of [[infinity-Dijkgraaf-Witten theory]] quantization by higher groupoid convolution algebras is indicated in ([FHLT 09](#FHLT)).


## Definition

### For bare categories (discrete geometry)

+-- {: .num_defn #CategoryAlgebra}
###### Definition

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[small category]] and let $R$ be a [[ring]].

The **category algebra** or **[[convolution algebra]]** $R[\mathcal{C}]$ of $\mathcal{C}$ over $R$ is the $R$-[[associative algebra|algebra]]

* whose underlying $R$-[[module]] is the [[free module]] $R[\mathcal{C}_1]$ over the set of [[morphisms]] of $\mathcal{C}$;

* whose product operation is defined on [[basis]]-elements $f,g \in \mathcal{C}_1 \hookrightarrow R[\mathcal{C}]$ to be their [[composition]] if they are composable and zero otherwise:

  $$
    f \cdot g := \left\lbrace
      \array{
        g \circ f & if\;composable
        \\
        0 & otherwise
      }
    \right.
   \,.
  $$ 

=--

+-- {: .num_remark #AsConvolutionAlgebra}
###### Remark

We may identify elements in $R[\mathcal{C}_1]$ with [[functions]] $\mathcal{C}_1 \to R$ with the property that they are non-vanishing only on finitely many elements. Under this identification for $\phi_1, \phi_2$ two such functions, their product in $R[\mathcal{C}]$ is given by the formula

$$
  \phi_1 \cdot \phi_2
  \;
   \colon
  \;
  f \mapsto
  \sum_{f_2 \circ f_1 = f}
  \phi_2(f_2)
  \cdot
  \phi_1(f_1)   
  \,,
$$

where $f,f_1,f_2 \in \mathcal{C}_1$. In particular if $\mathcal{C}$ is a [[groupoid]] so that every [[morphisms]] $f$ has an [[inverse]] $f^{-1}$ then this is equivalently

$$
  \phi_1 \cdot \phi_2
  \;
   \colon
  \;
  f \mapsto
  =
  \sum_{g \in \mathcal{C}_1}
  \phi_2(f \circ g^{-1})
  \cdot
  \phi_1(g) 
  \,.
$$

This expresses [[convolution]] of functions.


=--


+-- {: .num_defn #InvolutionByPullbackAlongInversion}
###### Remark

If the small category $\mathcal{C}_\bullet$ is a [[groupoid]], hence equipped with an [[inverse|inversion]] map

$$
  inv \colon \mathcal{C}_1 \to \mathcal{C}_1
$$

then [[pullback of functions]] along this map makes is an [[involution]] of the convolution algebra of $\mathcal{C}$ and hence makes it into a [[star-algebra]]. 

More generally for $\mathcal{C}$ equipped with the structure of a [[dagger-category]], pullback along the dagger-fuctor

$$
  \dagger \colon \mathcal{C}_1 \to \mathcal{C}_1
$$

makes the convolution algebra a star-algebra.

=--

### For Lie groupoids


+-- {: .num_remark #ForLieGroupoids}
###### Remark

If $\mathcal{C}$ is a groupoid with extra [[geometry|geometric]] structure, then there are natural variants of the above definition.

Notably if $\mathcal{C}$ is a [[Lie groupoid]] then there is a variant where the functions in remark \ref{AsConvolutionAlgebra} are taken to be [[smooth functions]] and where the convolution [[sum]] is replaced by an [[integration]]. In order for this to make sense one needs to consider in fact functions with values in half-[[densities]] over the [[manifold]] $\mathcal{C}_1$.

More generally, for a [[bundle gerbe]] over a Lie groupoid $\mathcal{C}$, hence a multiplicative [[line bundle]] over $\mathcal{C}_1$, one can consider a convolution product on [[sections]] of this line bundle tensored with half-densities.

=--

See the [References -- For continuous/smooth geometry](#ReferencesForSmoothGeometry).


+-- {: .num_defn #ContinuousCategoryAlgebraWithHalfDensities}
###### Definition

Let $\mathcal{G}_\bullet$ be a [[Lie groupoid]]. Write $C^\infty_c(\mathcal{G}_1, \sqrt{\Omega})$ for the space of smooth [[half-densities]] in $T_{d s = 0}\Gamma_1 \oplus T_{d t = 0}\Gamma_1$ of [[compact support]] on its [[manifold]] $\mathcal{G}_1$ of [[morphisms]]. Let the  [[convolution product]] 

$$
  \star \;\colon\; C_c(\mathcal{G}_1, \sqrt{\Omega}) \times C_c(\mathcal{G}_1, \sqrt{\Omega}) \to C_c(\mathcal{G}_1, \sqrt{\Omega})
$$

be given on elements $f,g \in C_c(\mathcal{G}_1, \sqrt{\Omega})$ over any element $\gamma \in \mathcal{G}_1$ by the [[integral]]

$$
  (f \star g) \colon \gamma
  \mapsto
  \int_{\gamma_2\circ \gamma_1 = \gamma}
  f(\gamma_1) \cdot f(\gamma_2)
  \,.
$$

(Here we regard the integrand naturally as taking values in actual [[densities]] tensored with the pullback of $\sqrt{Omega}$ along the composition map. This defines the [[integration]] of density-factor which then takes values in $\sqrt{\Omega}$.)

The algebra $(C_c^\infty(\mathcal{G}_1, \sqrt{\Omega}), \star)$ is the **groupoid convolution algebra** of smooth compactly supported functions. As in remark \ref{AsConvolutionAlgebra}, this is naturally a [[star-algebra]] with [[involution]] $inv^\ast$.

=--

This construction originates around ([Connes 82](#Connes82)).

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition/Definition

For $\mathcal{G}_\bullet$ a [[Lie groupoid]] and for $x \in \mathcal{G}_0$ any point in the manifold of [[objects]]
there is an involutive [[representation]] $\pi_x$ of the convolution algebra
$(C_c^\infty(\mathcal{G}_1, \sqrt{\Omega}), \star, inv^\ast)$ of def. \ref{ContinuousCategoryAlgebraWithHalfDensities} on the [[canonical Hilbert space of half-densities]] $L^2(s^{-1}(x))$ of the source fiber of $x$  given on any $\xi \in L^2(s^{-1}(x))$ by

$$
\pi_x(f) \xi \colon \gamma
 \mapsto 
  \int_{\gamma_1 \in t^{-1}(\gamma)}
  f(\gamma_1) \xi(\gamma_1^{-1}\gamma)
  \,.
$$

This defines a [[norm]] $|{\Vert \Vert}$ on the [[vector space]] $C_c^\infty(\mathcal{G}_1, \Omega)$ given by the [[supremum]] of the norms in $L^2(s^{-1}(x))$ over all points $x$:

$$
  {\Vert f\Vert}
  \coloneqq
  Sup_{x \in \mathcal{G}_0} {\Vert \pi_x(f)\Vert}
  \,.
$$

The [[Cauchy completion]] of the [[star algebra]] $(C_c^\infty(\mathcal{G}_1, \sqrt{\Omega}), \star, inv^\ast)$ with respect to this [[norm]] is a [[C-star-algebra]], the **convolution $C^\ast$-algebra** of the Lie groupoid $\mathcal{G}_\bullet$.


=--

This is recalled at ([Connes 94, prop. 3 on p. 106](#Connes94)).

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

With suitable definitions, this construction constituts a [[2-functor]] from [[differentiable stacks]] to [[C-star-algebras]] and [[Hilbert bimodules]] between them, ([Muhly-Renault-Williams 87](#MuhleReaultWilliams87), [Landsman 00](#Landsman00)).

## Equivalent characterizations

We discuss equivalent characterizations of category algebras/groupoid algebras that are useful in certain context

* [As a weak colimit over a constant 2Vect-valued functor
](#WeakColimit)

* [In terms of composition of spans](#InTermsOfCompositionOfSpans)

### As a weak colimit over a constant $2Vect$-valued functor
 {#WeakColimit}

Apparently for $\mathcal{C}$ a [[groupoid]] the 
category algebra of $C$ is the [[weak limit|weak colimit]] over $\mathcal{C}$ of the functor $\mathcal{C} \to Vect\text{-}Mod$
constant on the ground field algebra.

This statement is for instance in ([FHLT, section 8.4](#FHLT)).

The 2-cell in the universal co-cone corresponding
to the morphism $f \in C$ is the $k\text{-}k[C]$-bimodule
homomorphism $f \cdot (-) :  A \to A$ that multiplies
by $f \in k[C]$ from the left.

This description should be compared with the analogous description of the [[action groupoid]] by a weak colimit. One sees that the groupoid algebra is a linear incarnation of the action groupoid in some sense.




### In terms of composition of spans
 {#InTermsOfCompositionOfSpans}

The category algebra of a category $C$ is a special case of a general construction of [[spans]] (see also at _[[bi-brane]]_). 

In order not to get distracted by inessential technicalities, consider the case of a finite [[category]] $C$, i.e. an [[internal category]] in [[FinSet]]. This is a [[span]]
$$
  \array{
     && C_1
      \\
      & {}^{s}\swarrow
      && \searrow^{t}
     \\
     C_0
     &&&&
     C_0
  }
$$
equipped with a composition operation: a morphism
of spans from the composite span 
$$
  \array{
     &&&&
     C_1 \times_{t,s} C_1
     \\
     &&& \swarrow && \searrow
     \\
     && C_1
     &&&& C_1
      \\
      & {}^{s}\swarrow
      && \searrow^{t}
      && {}^{s}\swarrow
      && \searrow^{t}
     \\
     C_0
     &&&&
     C_0
     &&&&
     C_0
  }
$$
to the original one, i.e. a morphism 
$$
  comp : C_1 \times_{t,s} C_1 \to C_1
$$ 
which respects source and target morphisms. 

Given this, consider the trivial vector bundle on the set of objects $C_0$. This is nothing but an assignment
$$
  I : C_0 \to Vect_k
$$
of the [[ground field]] $k$ to each element of $C_0$. There are two different ways to pull this vector bundle on objects back to a vector bundle on morphisms, once along the source, once along the target map. 

Then notice that the set of natural transformations between these two vector bundles
$$
  Hom_{[Sets,Vect_k]}(s^* I , t^* I)
$$
whose elements are 2-arrows of the form
$$
  \array{
     && C_1
      \\
      & {}^{s}\swarrow
      && \searrow^{t}
     \\
     C_0
     &&\stackrel{f}{\Rightarrow}&&
     C_0
     \\
     & {}_I \searrow && \swarrow_I
     \\
     &&
     Vect_k
  }
$$
are canonically in bijection with $k$-calued functions on $C_1$, hence with the vector space spanned by $C_1$, hence with the vector space underlying the category algebra
$$
  Hom_{[Sets,Vect_k]}(s^* I , t^* I)
  \simeq
  k[C]
  \,.
$$

The algebra structure on $k[C]$ is similarly encoded in the diagrammatics: given two elements
$$
  \array{
     && C_1
      \\
      & {}^{s}\swarrow
      && \searrow^{t}
     \\
     C_0
     &&\stackrel{f}{\Rightarrow}&&
     C_0
     \\
     & {}_I \searrow && \swarrow_I
     \\
     &&
     Vect_k
  }

  \;\;\;\; 
  and
  \;\;\;\;

  \array{
     && C_1
      \\
      & {}^{s}\swarrow
      && \searrow^{t}
     \\
     C_0
     &&\stackrel{g}{\Rightarrow}&&
     C_0
     \\
     & {}_I \searrow && \swarrow_I
     \\
     &&
     Vect_k
  }
$$
their pre-composite is the diagram
$$
  \array{
     &&&&
     C_1 \times_{t,s} C_1
     \\
     &&& \swarrow && \searrow
     \\
     && C_1
     &&&& C_1
      \\
      & {}^{s}\swarrow
      && \searrow^{t}
      && {}^{s}\swarrow
      && \searrow^{t}
     \\
     C_0
     &&\stackrel{f}{\Rightarrow}&&
     C_0
     &&\stackrel{g}{\Rightarrow}&&
     C_0
     \\
     & \searrow &&& 
     \downarrow &&& \swarrow
     \\
     && \to &&Vect_k&& \leftarrow  
  }
  \,.
$$

This is a composite transformation between three trivial vector bundles on the set $C_1 \times_{t,s} C_1$ of composable morphisms in $C$. As such, it is a function, which on the element consisting of the composable pair $\stackrel{r}{\to}\stackrel{s}{\to}$ takes the value $f(r)\cdot g(s)$.

In order to get back a transformation between vector bundles on $C_1$, hence a transformation between vector bundles on $C_1$, we _push forward_ along the composition map $comp: C_1 \times_{t,s} C_1 \to C_1$. This just means that we add up the values on the fibers of this map.

The result is the [[convolution product]]
$$
  (f\star g) : t \mapsto \sum_{s\circ r = t}
  f(r)\cdot g(s)
  \,.
$$
This is indeed the product in the category algebra.

Looking at category algebras realizes them as a puny special case of a bigger story which involves [[bi-brane]]s as morphisms between $n$-bundles/$(n-1)$-gerbes which live on spaces connected by correspondence spaces. This is related to a bunch of things,  such as T-duality, Fourier-Mukai transformations and other issues of quantization. A description of this perspective is in

* [[schreiber:Nonabelian cocycles and their quantum symmetries]].

This is related to observations such as described here:


* [[John Baez]], [_Quantization and Cohomology (Week 17)_](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2007/03/quantization_and_cohomology_we_16.html)

### Relation to (twisted) K-theory
 {#RelationToTwistedKTheory}

The [[operator K-theory]] of the convolution $C^\ast$-algebra of a [[topological groupoid]] $\mathcal{X}_\bullet$ may be thought of as the [[topological K-theory]] of the corresponding [[topological stack]]. More generally, for $\mathcal{X} \to \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)$ a [[principal 2-bundle]] ([[bundle gerbe]]) on the groupoid/stack, the [[operator K-theory]] of the corresponding twisted convolution algebra is the [[twisted K-theory]] of the stack.
