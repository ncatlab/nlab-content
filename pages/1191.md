# Idea

An **inaccessible cardinal** is a [[cardinal number]] $\kappa$ which cannot be "accessed" from smaller cardinals using only the basic operations on cardinals.  It follows that the collection of sets smaller than $\kappa$ satisfies the axioms of set theory.

# Definition

An **inaccessible cardinal** is a regular strong limit [[cardinal number|cardinal]].  Recall that $\kappa$ is _regular_ if it is not a union of $\lt\kappa$ cardinals each of which is $\lt\kappa$, and a **strong limit** if $\lambda\lt \kappa$ implies $2^\lambda\lt\kappa$.

By this definition, $0$ (the cardinality of the empty set) and $\aleph_0$ (the cardinality of the [[natural number]]s) are both inaccessible.  Sometimes one explicitly requires inaccessible cardinals to be uncountable, so as to exclude these cases.

# Properties

A cardinal $\kappa$ is inaccessible precisely when the $\kappa$th level $V_\kappa$ of the [[von Neumann hierarchy]] is a [[Grothendieck universe]], and hence in particular itself a model of axiomatic [[set theory]].  For this reason, the existence of inaccessible cardinals cannot be proven in ordinary axiomatic set theory such as [[ZFC]].  The axiom asserting that there exists an inaccessible (which amounts to the existence of a Grothendieck universe) is thus the beginning of the study of [[large cardinal]]s.
