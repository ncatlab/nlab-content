# Recursion

## Idea

The notion of _recursion_ is the concept of defining [[functions]] and other mathematical objects by giving an _initial value_ or _constructor_ together with further rules for how to obtain all other values by successively applying to that further operations.

Traditionally this is typically considered for functions on the [[natural numbers]], but the general concept applies to considerably more general domains. In the case of natural numbers there is a rich theory regarding the functions which can or cannot be recursively defined: this is [[computability theory]] and has deep connections with the logic of [[Peano arithmetic]].

Recursion is formalized in [[type theory]] by the notion of _[[inductive type]]_ and, equivalently, in [[category theory]] by the notion of _[[initial algebra of an endofunctor]]_: for $F$ is an [[endofunctor]], a [[morphism]] of the form $F(X) \to X$ determines a collection of _constructors_ and the _induction principle_ is the statement that there is a (unique) morphism $f : A \to X$ from the [[initial object|initial]] such structure $F(A) \to A$. This $f$ is the corresponding _recursively defined function_.

Viewed from just a slightly different angle, this state of affairs is the _[[induction principle]]_.




## Examples

+-- {: .un_example}
###### Example

In the theory of Peano arithmetic, we define $x + y$ recursively in terms of the successor operation $s$ as follows:

1. $x + 0 = x$
2. $x + s(y) = s(x + y)$

The definition above is taken as axiomatic in Peano arithmetic. More generally, given a (parametrizable) [[natural numbers object]] $\mathbb{N}$, its universal property guarantees that there is a unique (!) map $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ with the above properties.

## Recursion theorem

### In general

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

Let $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ be [[set|sets]], and suppose $\rightsquigarrow$ is a [[well-founded relation]] on $X$. Let $h\colon X \times Y \times \mathcal{P}(Z) \to Z$ be a given function. Then, there is a unique function $f\colon X \to Z$ satisfying
$$f (x', y) = h (x', y, S)$$
for all $y$ in $Y$, where
$$S = \{ z \in Z : \exists x . \, ( x \rightsquigarrow x' \wedge z = f (x, y) ) \}$$

### For a natural numbers object

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

Let $\mathbb{N}$ be a (parametrizable) [[natural numbers object]] in a [[cartesian monoidal category|category with finite products]], with zero $0\colon 1 \to \mathbb{N}$ and successor $s\colon \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$. For any morphisms $f_0\colon Y \to Z$ and $h\colon \mathbb{N} \times Y \times Z \to Z$, there is a unique morphism $f\colon \mathbb{N} \times Y \to Z$ such that
$$f(0, -) = f_0$$
and
$$f(s(x), y) = h(s(x), y, f(x, y))$$
where $x\colon \mathbb{N} \times Y \to \mathbb{N}$ is the first projection and $y\colon \mathbb{N} \times Y \to Y$ is the second projection.
=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Recall that the universal property for $\mathbb{N}$ states that for data $g_0\colon Y \to A$, $k\colon Y \times A \to A$, there is a unique morphism $u\colon \mathbb{N} \times Y \to A$ such that $u \circ (0 \times \mathrm{id}_Y) = g_0$ and $u \circ (s \times \mathrm{id}_Y) = k \circ u$. We take $A = \mathbb{N} \times Z$, $g_0 = 0 \times f_0$, and $k(y, n, z) = \langle n, h(n, y, z) \rangle$, where $n\colon Y \times \mathbb{N} \times Z \to \mathbb{N}$, $y\colon Y \times \mathbb{N} \times Z \to Y$, and $z\colon Y \times \mathbb{N} \times Z \to Z$ are the obvious projections. The $f$ we seek is then obtained as $p_2 \circ u$, where $p_2 : \mathbb{N} \times Z \to Z$ is the second projection.
