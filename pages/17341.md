Hello! My name is Christian Williams (christianwilliams124@tamu.edu). I am a mathematics M.S. at Texas A&M University, conducting independent research that incorporates category theory.

This page is currently under construction, and will be far from acceptable quality for some time; please don't mind the mess until then. Right now it is just for documentation; the possibility of people seeing my work will focus me, and I prefer this format over developing a LaTeX PDF. Thank you very much!
