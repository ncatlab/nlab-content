The terminology 'plus construction' is used for two very different types of construction.



 *  The version which sends a presheaf to a separated presheaf to a sheaf is described in detail under [[sheaf]].

*  The process of killing a perfect normal subgroup of the fundamental group of a space is described under [[Quillen plus construction]].
