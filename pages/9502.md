

A regular [[foliation]] $\mathcal{P} \hookrightarrow T X$ is called **simple** if the [[leaf space]] $X/\mathcal{P}$ is a [[smooth manifold]] and the [[quotient]] [[projection]] $X \to X/\mathcal{P}$ is a [[surjective submersion]].

Conversely, a simple foliation is a foliation by [[leaves]] of a [[surjective submersion]].
