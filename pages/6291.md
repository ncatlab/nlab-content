## Idea

Absolute de Rham cohomology is a [[de Rham cohomology]] theory for [[arithmetic motives]] which provides a spectral interpretation of [[L-functions]]. It is viewed as a phenomenon in hypothetical "absolute" geometry "over a field of one element". It is hoped by some that it may help to approach [[Riemann hypothesis]].
