## Idea

The notion of _higher Segal space_ is a weakening of the notion of [[complete Segal space]]. As complete Segal spaces are models for [[(∞,1)-categories]], so higher Segal spaces are supposed to be models for [[(∞,n)-categories]] for higher $n$.

## Definition

### Lurie

In ([Lurie, section 1.3](#Lurie)) a recursive definition is given: a (complete) $(n+1)$-Segal space is a [[complete Segal space]] object in an [[(∞,1)-category]] of complete $n$-Segal spaces.

This is discussed at _[[n-fold complete Segal space]]_.

### Dyckerhoff-Kapranov

In ([DyckerhoffKapranov](#DyckerhoffKapranov)) a 2-Segal space is defined to be a simplicial space with a higher analog of the weak composition operation known from [[Segal spaces]].

Let $X$ be a [[simplicial topological space]] or [[bisimplicial set]] or generally a [[simplicial object]] in a suitable [[simplicial model category]].


For $n \in \mathbb{B}$ let $P_n$ be the $n$-[[polygon]]. For any [[triangulation]] $T$ of $P_n$ let $\Delta^T$ be the corresponding [[simplicial set]]. Regarding $\Delta^n$ as the cellular [[boundary]] of that polygon provides a morphism of simplicial sets $\Delta^T \to \Delta^n$.

Say that $X$ is a **2-Segal object** if for all $n$ and all $T$ as above, the induced [[morphisms]]

$$
  X_n := [\Delta^n, X]
  \to 
  X_T := [\Delta^T,X]
$$

are [[weak equivalences]].
