There are two different things that one might mean by a "complex supermanifold", and the term is in fact used for two different notions in the literature:

1. In the first sense, a complex supermanifold is a [[supermanifold]] that is related to complex [[vector bundle]]s as ordinary supermanifolds are related to real [[vector bundle]]s.
 

1. In the second sense, a complex supermanifold is a super(complex manifold), a super-version of [[complex manifold]].
