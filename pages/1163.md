The standard $n$-th [[homology group]] of a CW complex $X$ is isomorphic to the $n$-th [[homotopy group]] of the free topological commutative monoid on $X$, which is an infinite [[symmetric product]] that is the colimit $\mathrm{Sym}^\infty X$ (denoted also $SP^\infty$) of the symmetric powers $\mathrm{Sym}^N X = X*X*...*X = (X\times X\times ...\times X)/\Sigma_N$ of $X$:
$$
H_i(X) = \pi_i (\mathrm{colim}_N\, \mathrm{Sym}^N X)
$$

The [[Meyer-Vietoris sequence]] for homology is a consequence of applying $\pi_*(-)$ to the homotopy pullback square resulting from the application of $\mathrm{Sym}^\infty$ to the homotopy pushout square formed by the inclusions of the intersection, $A \cap B$, of two subspaces $A$ and $B$ of a space $X$ into $A$ and $B$.
