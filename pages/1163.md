###### Definition
**(Symmetric Product)**

There is a natural forgetful functor from topological commutative monoids to [[pointed space|pointed topological spaces]], where the basepoint of a commutative monoid is taken to be its unit element. The induced monad is the _infinite symmetric product_ construction:

$$
  Sym(X,e) = \mathrm{colim}_N Sym^N(X) \qquad
  Sym^N(X) = (X \times \dots \times X)/\Sigma_N
$$

Here the colimit is taken over the maps $Sym^N(X) \to Sym^{N+1}(X)$, $(x_1,\dots, x_n) \mapsto (x_1,\dots, x_n, e)$ where $e$ is the basepoint.

Thus $Sym(X,e)$ is the free topological commutative monoid on $X$ with the basepoint $e$ acting as the unit.

###### Theorem
**(Dold-Thom)**

The [[ordinary homology]],  hence the standard $n$-th [[homology group]] of a [[pointed connected CW-complex]] $(X,e)$ is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the $n$-th [[homotopy group]] of the infinite symmetric product of $(X,e)$

$$
  H_i(X) = \pi_i (\mathrm{colim}_N\, \mathrm{Sym}^N X)
  \,.
$$

The [[Mayer-Vietoris sequence]] for homology is a consequence of applying $\pi_*(-)$ to the [[homotopy pullback]] square resulting from the application of $\mathrm{Sym}^\infty$ to the [[homotopy pushout]] square formed by the inclusions of the intersection, $A \cap B$, of two subspaces $A$ and $B$ of a space $X$ into $A$ and $B$.
