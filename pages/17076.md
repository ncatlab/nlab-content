## Idea

The $n$-[[sphere]] for $n = 3$.

## Isomorphisms

The underlying manifold of the [[special unitary group]] [[SU(2)]] happens to be [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the 3-sphere, hence also that of [[spin group|Spin(3)]].

The [[quotient]] of that by the [[binary icosahedral group]] is the [[Poincar√© homology sphere]].
