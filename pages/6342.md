## Idea

In the late 1920s, [[Eugene Wigner]] highlighted the role that [[group theory]] and [[representation theory]] play in the analysis of [[quantum mechanics]], for instance in the analysis of [[atomic spectrum|atomic spectra]]. While many applications of [[groups]] and their [[representations]] to [[quantum physics]] had more or less explicitly been observed before, Wigner stood out as making the mathematical formalism fully explicit. This attitude was not well received by some of his colleagues, who felt that this formal [[mathematics]] had no place in [[physics]]. In particular [[Erwin Schrödinger]] is said ([Wigner (1981)](#Wigner81)) to have spoken of the _**Gruppenpest**_ (German for "plague of group theory") which ought to be abandoned. 

Eventually this resistence vanished and turned into its opposite in theoretical fundamental physics: in the classification of [[fundamental particle]]s by [[unitary representations of the Poincaré group]] introduced by [[Hermann Weyl]], in the description of [[gauge theory]] in terms of [[associated bundle]]s given by [[representation]]s of [[gauge groups]]. Today almost the first thing that one wants to know about a physical theory is its [[gauge group]] and the [[representation]]s of it that play a role.
