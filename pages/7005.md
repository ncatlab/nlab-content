## Idea

In [[intensional type theory]], [[identity types]] behave like [[path space objects]]; this viewpoint is called [[homotopy type theory]].  This induces furthermore a notion of [[homotopy fibers]], hence of [[homotopy equivalence]]s between [[types]].

On the other hand, if type theory contains a [[universe]] [[Type]], so that types can be considered as *points* of $Type$, then between two types we also have an [[identity type]] $Paths_{Type}(X,Y)$.  The _univalence axiom_ says that these two notions of "sameness" for types are the same.  Morally, this says that [[Type]] behaves like an [[object classifier]].

The name *univalence* (due to Voevodsky) comes from the following reasoning.  A fibration or bundle $p\colon E\to B$ of some sort is commonly said to be *universal* if every other bundle of the same sort is a pullback of $p$ in a unique way (up to homotopy).  Less commonly, a bundle is said to be *versal* if every other bundle is a pullback of it in *some* way, not necessarily unique.  By contrast, a bundle is said to be *univalent* if every other bundle is a pullback of it in *at most one* way (up to homotopy).  The univalence axiom then says that the canonical fibration over $Type$ is univalent.


## Definition

We state univalence first in ([[intensional type theory|intensional]]) [[type theory]] and then in its [[categorical semantics]].

### In the type theory

Let $X$ and $Y$ be [[types]].  There is a canonically defined map from the [[identity type]] $(X = Y)$ of paths (in [[Type]]) between them to the [[function type]] $(X \simeq Y)$ of [[equivalences]] between them.  It can be defined by *path induction*, i.e. the eliminator for the identity types, by specifying that it takes the identity path $1_X \colon (X=X)$ to the identity equivalence of $X$.

**Univalence:** _For any two [[types]] $X,Y$, this map $(X=Y)\to (X\simeq Y)$ is an equivalence._

Univalence is a commonly assumed axiom in [[homotopy type theory]], and is central to the proposal ([Voevodsky](#Voevodsky)) that this provides a natively [[homotopy theory|homotopy theoretic]] [[foundation]] of [[mathematics]] (the _Univalent Foundations Project_.)

### In categorical semantics
 {#InCategoricalSemantics}

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[locally cartesian closed model category]]. 

By the [[categorical semantics]] of [[homotopy type theory]], a
[[dependent type]]

$$
  b : B \vdash E(b) : Type
$$

corresponds to a [[morphism]] $E \to B$ in $\mathcal{C}$ such that 
this is a fibration between fibrant objects.

Then the dependent [[function type]]

$$
  b_1 b_2 : B \vdash ( E(b_1) \to E(b_2)) : Type
$$

is interpreted as the [[internal hom]] $[-,-]_{\mathcal{C}/_{B \times B}}$ in the [[slice category]] $\mathcal{C}/_{B \times B}$
after extending $E$ to the [[context]] $B \times B$ along the two projections
$p_1, p_2 : B \times B \to B$, respectively. Hence this is interpreted as

$$
  [E \times B \, , \, B \times E]_{\mathcal{C}/_{B \times B}}
  \in 
  \mathcal{C}/_{B \times B}
  \,.
$$

Consider then the [[diagonal]] $\Delta_B : B \to B \times B$ morphism in $\mathcal{C}$ as an object of $\mathcal{C}/_{B \times B}$.

The [[diagram]] in $\mathcal{C}$

$$
  \array{  
    \Delta_B^* E \times B &\to& E \times B
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    B &\stackrel{\Delta_B}{\to}& B \times B
    \\  
    & {}_{\mathllap{\Delta_B}}\searrow & \downarrow^{\sigma}
    \\
    && B \times B
  }
  \,,
$$

where the top square is a [[pullback]] and where $\sigma : B \times B \to B \times B$ denotes the [[braided monoidal category|braiding]], exhibits a canonical morphism 

$$
  \Delta_B \times_{\mathcal{C}/_{B \times B}} E \times B \to 
  B \times E
$$

in $\mathcal{C}/_{B \times B}$, ince the [[product]] in $\mathcal{C}/_{B \times B}$ is a [[pullback]] in $\mathcal{B}$, this . By the product-hom [[adjunction]] this is identified with a morphism

$$
  \Delta_B \to [E \times B , B \times E]_{\mathcal{C}/_{B \times B}}
  \,.
$$

Finally, let $Eq(E) \hookrightarrow [E \times B , B \times E]_{\mathcal{C}/_{B \times B}}$ be the subobject (...) on the weak equivalences, and observe that the above morphisms factors (...)

$$
  \Delta_B \to Eq(E)
  \,.
$$

Then $E \to B$ is univalent in $\mathcal{C}$ if this morphism is a weak equivalence.

(...)

#### In simplicial sets
 {#InSimplicialSets}

Let $C = $ [[sSet]], equipped with the 
standard [[model structure on simplicial sets]].

For $E \to X$ any fibration ([[Kan fibration]])
between fibrant objects ([[Kan complexes]]),
consider first the simplicial set

$$
  [E \times B , B \times E]_{B \times B}
  \in 
  sSet/_{B \times B} 
$$

defined as the [[internal hom]] in the [[slice category]] $sSet/_{B \times B}$.

Notice that the vertices of this simplicial set over 
a fixed pair $(b_1, b_2) : * \to B \times B$ of vertices in $B$ form the set of morphisms $E_{b_1} \to E_{b_2}$ between the [[fibers]] in $sSet$.

This is because -- by the defining property of the [[internal hom]] in the [[slice category|slice]] and using that [[products]] in $sSet/_{B \times B}$ are [[pullbacks]] in $sSet$ -- the horizontal morphisms of simplcial sets in

$$
  \array{
    * &&\to&& [E \times B, B \times E]_{B \times B}
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{(b_1,b_2)}}\searrow && \swarrow
    \\
    && B \times B
  }
$$

correspond bijectively to the horizontal morphisms in

$$
  \array{
    E_{b_1} \times \{b_2\} &&\to&& \{b_1\} \times E_{b_2}
    \\
    & \searrow && \swarrow
    \\
    && B \times B
  }
$$

in $sSet$, which are precisely morphisms $E_{b_1} \to E_{b_2}$.

Let then 

$$
  Eq(E) \hookrightarrow [E \times B, B \times E]_{B \times B}
  \in sSet/_{B \times B}
$$

be the full sub-simplicial set on those vertices that correspond to 
[[weak equivalences]]
(([[weak homotopy equivalence|weak]]) [[homotopy equivalences]]).

By a similar consideration, one sees that the [[diagonal]] morphism
$\Delta_B : B \to B \times B$ in $sSet$, regarded as an object  $B \in sSet/_{B \times B}$, comes with a canonical morphism

$$
  B \to Eq(E)
  \,.
$$

The fibration $E \to B$ is univalent, precisely when this morphism is  a weak equivalence.
