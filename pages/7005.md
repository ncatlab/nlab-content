## Idea

In [[intensional type theory]], [[identity types]] behave like [[path space objects]]; this viewpoint is called [[homotopy type theory]].  This induces furthermore a notion of [[homotopy fibers]], hence of [[homotopy equivalence]]s between [[types]].

On the other hand, if type theory contains a [[universe]] [[Type]], so that types can be considered as *points* of $Type$, then between two types we also have an [[identity type]] $Paths_{Type}(X,Y)$.  The _univalence axiom_ says that these two notions of "sameness" for types are the same.  Morally, this says that [[Type]] behaves like an [[object classifier]].

The name *univalence* (due to Voevodsky) comes from the following reasoning.  A fibration or bundle $p\colon E\to B$ of some sort is commonly said to be *universal* if every other bundle of the same sort is a pullback of $p$ in a unique way (up to homotopy).  Less commonly, a bundle is said to be *versal* if every other bundle is a pullback of it in *some* way, not necessarily unique.  By contrast, a bundle is said to be *univalent* if every other bundle is a pullback of it in *at most one* way (up to homotopy).  The univalence axiom then says that the canonical fibration over $Type$ is univalent, for every fibration with _small_ fibers is an essentially unique pullback of this one (while those with large fibers are not, they are pullbacks of the next higher $Type_1$). 


## Definition

We state univalence first in ([[intensional type theory|intensional]]) [[type theory]] and then in its [[categorical semantics]].

### In the type theory

Let $X$ and $Y$ be [[types]].  There is a canonically defined map from the [[identity type]] $(X = Y)$ of paths (in [[Type]]) between them to the [[function type]] $(X \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} Y)$ of [[equivalences in homotopy type theory]] between them.  It can be defined by *[path induction](inductive%20type#PathInduction)*, i.e. the [[term elimination rule|eliminator]] for the identity types, by specifying that it takes the identity path $1_X \colon (X=X)$ to the identity equivalence of $X$.

**Univalence:** _For any two [[types]] $X,Y$, this map $(X=Y)\to (X\simeq Y)$ is an [[equivalence in homotopy type theory|equivalence]]._

Univalence is a commonly assumed [[axiom]] in [[homotopy type theory]], and is central to the proposal ([Voevodsky](#Voevodsky)) that this provides a natively [[homotopy theory|homotopy theoretic]] [[foundation]] of [[mathematics]] (the _Univalent Foundations Project_.)

### In categorical semantics
 {#InCategoricalSemantics}

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[locally cartesian closed model category]] in which all objects are cofibrant. 

By the [[categorical semantics]] of [[homotopy type theory]], a [[dependent type]]

$$
  b : B \vdash E(b) : Type
$$

corresponds to a [[morphism]] $E \to B$ in $\mathcal{C}$ that is a [[fibration]] between fibrant objects.

Then the [[dependent type|dependent]] [[function type]]

$$
  b_1, b_2 : B \vdash ( E(b_1) \to E(b_2)) : Type
$$

is interpreted as the [[internal hom]] $[-,-]_{\mathcal{C}/_{B \times B}}$ in the [[slice category]] $\mathcal{C}/_{B \times B}$ after extending $E$ to the [[context]] $B \times B$ by pulling back along the two projections $p_1, p_2 : B \times B \to B$, respectively. Hence this is interpreted as

$$
  [p_1^* E \, , \, p_2^* E]_{\mathcal{C}/_{B \times B}}
  \simeq
  [E \times B \, , \, B \times E]_{\mathcal{C}/_{B \times B}}
  \in 
  \mathcal{C}/_{B \times B}
  \,.
$$

Consider then the [[diagonal]] morphism $\Delta_B : B \to B \times B$  in $\mathcal{C}$ as an object of $\mathcal{C}/_{B \times B}$.  We would like to define a morphism 
$$ q \colon \Delta_B \to [E \times B , B \times E]_{\mathcal{C}/_{B \times B}} \,.$$
in $\mathcal{C}/_{B \times B}$.  By the defining ([[product]] $\dashv$ [[internal hom]])-[[adjunction]], it suffices to define a morphism
$$ \Delta_B \times_{\mathcal{C}/_{B \times B}} E \times B \to B \times E $$
in $\mathcal{C}/_{B \times B}$.  But now by the 
[[universal property]] of [[pullback]], it suffices to define just in $\mathcal{C}_{/B}$ a morphism
$$ \Delta_B \times_{\mathcal{C}/_{B \times B}} E \times B \to \Delta_B \times_{\mathcal{C}/_{B \times B}} B \times E\,. $$  
And since the composite pullback along either composite
$$ B \xrightarrow{\Delta_B} B\times B \xrightarrow{\pi_1} B$$
$$ B \xrightarrow{\Delta_B} B\times B \xrightarrow{\pi_2} B$$
is the identity, both $\Delta_B \times_{\mathcal{C}/_{B \times B}} E \times B$ and $\Delta_B \times_{\mathcal{C}/_{B \times B}} B \times E$ are isomorphic to $E$; thus here we can take the [[identity]] morphism.

Now, using the [[path object]] factorization in $\mathcal{C}$

$$
  \array{
     B &&\stackrel{\simeq}{\hookrightarrow}&& B^I
     \\
     & {}_{\mathllap{\Delta_B}}\searrow
     && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{}}
     \\
     && B \times B
  }
$$

by an acyclic cofibration followed by a fibration, we obtain a fibrant replacement of $\Delta_B$ in the [[slice model category]] $\mathcal{C}_{B \times B}$.

Since also $[E \times B, B \times E]_{\mathcal{C}/_{B \times B}}$ is fibrant by the axioms on the [[locally cartesian closed model category]] $\mathcal{C}$, we have a 
lift $\hat q$ in the [[diagram]] in $\mathcal{C}/_{B \times B}$

$$
  \array{
    B &\stackrel{q}{\to}& [E \times B, B \times E]_{\mathcal{C}/_{B \times B}}
   \\
   \downarrow &{}^{\mathllap{\hat q}}\nearrow& \downarrow
   \\
   B^I &\to& B \times B = *_{\mathcal{C}/_{B \times B}}
  } 
  \,.
$$

This lift is the interpretation of the [[identity type|path induction]] that deduces a map on all paths $\gamma \in B^I$ from one on just the identity paths $id_b \in B \hookrightarrow B^I$.


Finally, let $Eq(E) \hookrightarrow [E \times B , B \times E]_{\mathcal{C}/_{B \times B}}$ be the [[subobject]]  on the weak equivalences (...), and observe that $q$ and $\hat q$ factor through this to give a morphism

$$
  \hat q : B^I \to Eq(E)
  \,.
$$

The fibration $E \to B$ is **univalent** in $\mathcal{C}$ if this morphism is a weak equivalence.  By the [[2-out-of-3 property]], of course, it is equivalent to ask that $q\colon B\to Eq(E)$ be a weak equivalence.

(...)

#### In simplicial sets
 {#InSimplicialSets}

We specialize the [general discussion](#InCategoricalSemantics) above to the realization in $\mathcal{C} = $ [[sSet]], equipped with the 
standard [[model structure on simplicial sets]].

For $E \to X$ any fibration ([[Kan fibration]])
between fibrant objects ([[Kan complexes]]),
consider first the simplicial set

$$
  [E \times B , B \times E]_{B \times B}
  \in 
  sSet/_{B \times B} 
$$

defined as the [[internal hom]] in the [[slice category]] $sSet/_{B \times B}$.

Notice that the vertices of this simplicial set over 
a fixed pair $(b_1, b_2) : * \to B \times B$ of vertices in $B$ form the set of morphisms $E_{b_1} \to E_{b_2}$ between the [[fibers]] in $sSet$.

This is because -- by the defining property of the [[internal hom]] in the [[slice category|slice]] and using that [[products]] in $sSet/_{B \times B}$ are [[pullbacks]] in $sSet$ -- the horizontal morphisms of simplcial sets in

$$
  \array{
    * &&\to&& [E \times B, B \times E]_{B \times B}
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{(b_1,b_2)}}\searrow && \swarrow
    \\
    && B \times B
  }
$$

correspond bijectively to the horizontal morphisms in

$$
  \array{
    E_{b_1} \times \{b_2\} &&\to&& \{b_1\} \times E_{b_2}
    \\
    & \searrow && \swarrow
    \\
    && B \times B
  }
$$

in $sSet$, which are precisely morphisms $E_{b_1} \to E_{b_2}$.

Let then 

$$
  Eq(E) \hookrightarrow [E \times B, B \times E]_{B \times B}
  \in sSet/_{B \times B}
$$

be the full sub-simplicial set on those vertices that correspond to 
[[weak equivalences]]
(([[weak homotopy equivalence|weak]]) [[homotopy equivalences]]).

By a similar consideration, one sees that the [[diagonal]] morphism
$\Delta_B : B \to B \times B$ in $sSet$, regarded as an object  $B \in sSet/_{B \times B}$, comes with a canonical morphism

$$
  B \to Eq(E)
  \,.
$$

The fibration $E \to B$ is univalent, precisely when this morphism is  a weak equivalence.

This appears originally as [Voevodsky, def. 3.4](#UnivalentFoundationsProject)

## Properties

### Relation to function extensionality

The univalence axiom implies [[function extensionality]].

A commented version of a formal proof of this fact can be found in ([Bauer-Lumsdaine](#BauerLumsdaine)).

### Canonicity
 {#Canonicity}

It is currently open whether the univalence axiom enjoys [[canonicity]] in general, but for the special case of [[1-truncated]] homotopy types ([[groupoids]]) (and two nested univalent [[universes]] and [[function extensionality]]), a "homotopical" sort of [[canonicity]] has been shown in ([Shulman 12, section 13](#Shulman12).  Thus, in univalent homotopy 1-type theory with two universes, every [[term]] of [[type]] of the [[natural numbers]] is [[propositional equality|propositionally equal]] to a [[numeral]].

The construction in ([Shulman 12, section 13](#Shulman12)) uses [[Artin gluing]] of a suitable [[type-theoretic model category|type-theoretic fibration category]] with the [[category]] [[Set]] and [[Grpd]], respectively, effectively inducing canonicity from these categories. By ([Shulman 12, remark 13.13](#Shulman12)) for this construction to generalize to untruncated univalent type theory, one seems to need a sufficiently strict [[global sections]] functor with values in some model for [[infinity-groupoids]].

Notice that this sort of [[canonicity]] does not yet imply [[computational effectiveness]], which would require also an [[algorithm]] to extract that [[numeral]] from the given [[term]].  There may be such an algorithm, but so far attempts to extract one from the proof (or to give a [[constructive mathematics|constructive]] version of the [[proof]], which would imply the existence of an algorithm) have not succeeded.

It is also a *[[propositional equality|propositional]]* canonicity, as opposed to the [[judgmental equality|judgmental]] canonicity which many traditional [[type theories]] enjoy.  Another approach to canonicity for 1-truncated univalence can be found in ([Harper-Licata](#HarperLicata)), which involves modifying the type theory by adding more [[judgmental equalities]], resulting in a judgmental canonicity.  However, no [[algorithm]] for computing canonical forms has yet been given for this approach either.

Another approach to solving canonicity is to build a model for [[homotopy type theory]] inside a theory which is known to be [[constructive mathematics|constructive]], such as ordinary (univalence-free) [[intensional type theory]].  Then one could induce canonicity, with an [[algorithm]], from the latter to the former.  This is the direction of the work of ([Coquand-Huber 13](#CoquandHuber13)), which models univalent [[homotopy type theory]] in [[constructive mathematics|constructive]] [[cubical sets]], or the truncated form in constructive truncated [[simplicial sets]].  One might also try to construct the Hoffman-Streicher groupoid model in a constructive framework; Awodey and Bauer have done some work in this direction with an [[predicative mathematics|impredicative]] [[universe]] of [[h-sets]].

## Related concepts

Univalence is closely related to the "completeness" condition in the theory of [[Segal spaces]]/[[semi-Segal spaces]]. See _[[complete Segal space]]_/_[[complete semi-Segal space]]_.
