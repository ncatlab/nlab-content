## Idea

In [[intensional type theory]] [[identity types]] behave like [[path space objects]]. This induces furthermore a notion of [[homotopy fibers]] hence of [[weak homotopy equivalence]]s between [[types]].

The _univalence axiom_ says that the original notion of paths and the notion of weak equivalence that it induces are compatible, in that 

**Univalence:** _For any two [[types]] $X,Y$, the type $X == Y$ of paths between them is equivalent to the type $X \simeq Y$ of equivalences between them._

If this axiom is added to [[intensional type theory|intensional]] ([[Martin-Löf dependent type theory|Martin-Löf]]) [[dependent type theory]], one ontains [[homotopy type theory]].

The proposal ([Voevodsky](#Voevodsky)) that this provides a natively [[homotopy theory|homotopy theoretic]] [[foundation]] of [[mathematics]] goes by the name _Univalent Foundations Project_.

## Properties

The univalence axiom implies [[function extensionality]].


## References

The univalence axiom was introduced and promoted independntly by [[Steve Awodey]] and [[Vladimir Voevodsky]] around 2005/06.
