## Definition

A [[differential form]] $\omega \in \Omega^n(X)$ on a [[Riemannian manifold]] $(X,g)$ is called a **harmonic fom** if it is in the [[kernel]] of the [[Laplace operator]] $\Delta_g$ of $X$ in that $\Delta \omega = (d + d^\dagger)^2 \omega = 0$.

## Properties

The basic properties of harmonic forms are described by [[Hodge theory]]. See there for details.
