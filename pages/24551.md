# Idea

A _linear-non-linear polycategory_ or simply _LNL polycategory_ is a generalization of a symmetric [[polycategory]] to include "non-linear" objects in the same way that [[linear-non-linear logic]] generalizes [[symmetric multicategories]]. Just as linear-non-linear logic provides a setting in which the exponential [[comonad]] ! in intuitionistic linear logic can be decomposed into an [[adjunction]], LNL polycategories provide a setting in which the exponential comonad ! and the monad ? in classical linear logic can each be decomposed into adjunctions.

In addition to the study of classical linear-logic, LNL polycategories can be used as a unified setting in which to study [[multicategory]] and [[polycategory]]-like structures as "LNL [[doctrines]]".

# Doctrines

See the original paper for a definition of LNL doctrine.

The following is an incomplete list of structures that can be defined as LNL doctrines:

* [[cartesian multicategories]]
* [[symmetric multicategories]]
* [[symmetric polycategories]]
* [[linear-non-linear logic]]
* [[skew multicategories]]
* [[call-by-push-value]]
* [[Freyd multicategories]]
* [[adjunctions]]
* models of [[classical linear logic]]
