## Idea

Chern-Weil theory studies the refinement of [[characteristic class]]es of [[principal bundle]]s in ordinary [[cohomology]] to [[de Rham cohomology]] and further to [[ordinary differential cohomology]]. 

The central operation that models this refinement is the construction of the [[Chern-Weil homomorphism]] from $G$-[[principal bundle]]s to [[de Rham cohomology]] by choosing a [[connection on a bundle|connection]] $\nabla$ and evaluating its [[curvature]] form $F_\nabla$ in the [[invariant polynomial]]s $\langle -\rangle$ of the [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ to produce the [[curvature characteristic form]] $\langle F_\nabla \rangle$. Its de Rham cohomology class refines a corresponding [[characteristic class]] in [[integral cohomology]]. 

## Generalizations

### To principal $\infty$-bundles

The notions of [[Lie group]], [[Lie algebra]], [[principal bundle]] and all the other ingredients of ordinary Chern-Weil theory generalize to notions in [[higher category theory]] such as  [[∞-Lie group]], [[∞-Lie algebra]], [[principal ∞-bundle]] etc. The generalization of Chern-Weil theory to this context is discussed at 

* [[∞-Chern-Weil theory]].

### In noncommutative geometry

There is a [[noncommutative geometry|noncommutative]] analogue discussed in ([AlekseevMeinrenken2000](AlekseevMeinrenken)).

## History {#History}

> (following notes provided by [[Jim Stasheff]])

The beginnings of the [[rational homotopy theory]] of [[Lie group]]s $G$ and hence their [[dg-algebra]]-description in terms of the [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] $CE(\mathfrak{g})$ originate in the first half of the 20th century.

In his survey of what was known in 1936 on the homology of compact Lie groups 

* [[Eli Cartan]], _La topologie des espaces représentatifs des groupes de Lie_ Act. Sci. Ind., No. 358, Hermann, Paris, (1936).

  reprinted in _Cartan's Complete Works_ vol $I_2$ pp. 1307-1330

E. Cartan conjectured that there should be a general result implying that the [[homology]] of the [[classical Lie group]]s is the same as the homology of a product of odd-dimensional [[sphere]]s. In particular, he lists the [[Poincare polynomial]]s for classical simple compact Lie groups.

In

* [[Heinz Hopf]],  _Über die Topologie der Gruppen-Mannigfaltigkeiten und ihre Verallgemeinerungen_  (German)  Ann. of Math. (2)  42,  (1941). 22--52.

Hopf showed that such a characterization in terms of homology groups as [[intersection pairing]] algebras holds for any [[compact space|compact]] [[dimension|finite dimensional]] [[connected]] [[orientable]] [[manifold]] with a map $m:M\times M\to M$ such that left and right translation have non-zero degrees.

Later in

* [[Shiing-shen Chern]], _Differential geometry of fiber bundles_ Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians, Cambridge, Mass., 1950, vol. 2, pages 397-411,  Amer. Math. Soc., Providence, R. I. (1952)

with the development of [[cohomology]], especially [[de Rham cohomology]], this was stated as $H^\bullet(G)$ being [[isomorphic]] to  an [[exterior algebra]] on odd dimensional generators: the generating [[Lie algebra cohomology]] [[cocycle]]s $\mu \in CE(\mathfrak{g})$, $d_{CE(\mathfrak{g})} \mu = 0$.

Henri Cartan in

* [[Henri Cartan]], _Notions d'algébre différentielle; applications aux groupes de Lie et aux variétés où opère un groupe de Lie_ ,  Coll. Topologie Algébrique Bruxelles (1950)
15-28

  section 7, titled _Classes caracteristiques (reelles) d'un espace fibre principal_

at the end (1951) of an era of deRham cohomology dominence (prior to Serre's thesis) abstracted the [[differential geometry|differential geometric]] approach of Chern-Weil and the [[Weil algebra]] $W(\mathfrak{g})$ to the [[dg-algebra]] context with his notion of _$\mathfrak{g}$-algebras $A$_ . This involves what is known sometimes as the [[Cartan calculus]].  In addition to the differential $d$ of [[differential form]]s on a [[principal bundle]], Cartan abstracts the inner product aka contraction of differential forms with [[vector field]]s $X$ and the [[Lie derivative]] $\mathcal{L}_X$ with respect to vector fields.  that is, he posits 3 operators on a differential-graded-commutative alggebra (dgca):

$d$ of degree 1, $i_X$ of degree -1 and $L_X$ of degree 0 for X in $\mathfrak{g}$ subject to the relations:

* $[\iota_X,\iota_Y] = \iota_{[X,Y]}$

* $ [\mathcal{L}_X,\iota_Y]= \iota_{[X,Y]} $

and perhaps most useful

* $\mathcal{L}_X = d \iota_X + i\iota_X d$

This is what he terms a $\mathfrak{g}$-algebra.

For Cartan, an infinitesimal [[connection on a bundle|connection]] on a [[principal bundle]] $P \to X$ are  projectors (at each point $p$ of $P$) $\phi_p: T_p P\to T_p^{vert}$ equivariant with repect to the $G$-action. 
This can be abstracted to a morphism

$$
  \Omega^\bullet(P) \leftarrow \mathfrak{g}^* : A
$$

of [[graded vector space]]s of degree 1 -- equivalently a [[Lie-algebra valued 1-form]] $A \in \Omega^1(P,\mathfrak{g})$ -- such that the two [[Ehresmann connection|Ehresmann condition]]s hold: 

1. restricted to the fibers the 1-form $A$ is the [[Maurer-Cartan form]]

   $\iota_X A(h) = \iota_X h$

1. the form is equivariant in that 

   $\mathcal{L}_X A (h) = A(\mathcal{L}_X h)$

  for all $X\in \mathfrak{g}$ and $h\in \mathfrak{g}^*$.  This data Cartan calls an _algebraic connection_ .

He then extends such an $A$ to a [[homomorphism]] of [[graded algebra]]s 

$$
  \Omega^\bullet(P) \leftarrow CE(\mathfrak{g}) : A
$$

from the [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] $\wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^*$.

In general, this will not respect the differentials, hence not be a morphism of [[dg-algebra]]s. In fact, the deviation gives the [[curvature]] of the connection: the curvature tensor is the map $h\mapsto d_{dR} A(h)-A(d_{CE} h)$.
