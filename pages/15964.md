A [[topos]] can be viewed as a generalization of a [[topological space]].  A _smooth structure on a topos_ is a corresponding generalization of the notion of [[smooth manifold]], in that to put a smooth structure on $Sh(X)$, for a topological space $X$, is (at least closely related to) putting the structure of a smooth manifold on $X$.  However, since it is phrased internally with reference to the (Cauchy and Dedekind) [[real numbers objects]], it is applicable to any topos.
