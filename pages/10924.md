## Quotes

from p. xii:

> Among the magisterial mistakes of logic, one will first mention [[quantum logic]], whose ridiculousness can only be ascribed to a feeling of superiority of the language – and ideas, even bad, as soon as they take a written form – over the physical world. Quantum logic is indeed a sort of punishment inflicted on nature, guilty of not yielding to the prejudices of logicians... just like Xerxes had the Hellespont – which had destroyed a boat bridge – whipped.
