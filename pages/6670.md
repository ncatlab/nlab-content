## Definition

By comparing the notions of [[regular epimorphism]] and [[effective epimorphism]] with that of [[effective epimorphism in an (∞,1)-category]], we propose to call a morphism $f : c \to d$ in an [[(∞,1)-category]] a **regular epimorphism** if it is the [[colimit]] of some simplicial diagram, i.e. if there exists a functor $c : \Delta^{op} \to C$, such that $f$  is the [[colimit in a quasi-category|colimiting cocone]]

$$
  \cdots c_2 \stackrel{\to}{\stackrel{\to}{\to}} c_1 \stackrel{\to}{\to} c \stackrel{f}{\to} d
$$

over this diagram.

Equivalently, this is a morphism such that for all objects $e \in C$ the induced morphism $f^* : C(d,e) \to C(c,e)$ is a [[regular monomorphism in an (∞,1)-category]] in the [[(∞,1)-category]] [[∞Grpd]].

**Warning**. Such a morphism may fail to satisfy some condition for being a plain _epimorphism_ in an [[(∞,1)-category]] that you might think of; in particular it need not be a [[monomorphism in an (∞,1)-category]].  The idea is that there may not be a good notion of epimorphism in an [[(∞,1)-category]] apart from regular epimorphism.

## Questions

* If $f$ has a [[Cech nerve]] and is a regular epimorphism above, does it follow that it is the colimit of its Cech nerve (that is, that it is an [[effective epimorphism in an (∞,1)-category]])?

* Is there a notion of a [[strict epimorphism]] in an [[(∞,1)-category]]?
