By analogy with [[poset]] and [[toset]], we may define a **proset** to be a set equipped with a [[preorder]].  This terminology is nonstandard but tempting.

[[Tim Porter]]: I see a potential problem with this terminology.   Proset has an already accepted meaning as a pro-object in Sets and that terminology dates back to early days of Grothendieck on Descent, so is well established. There are several situations in the various pages and entries that will lead to pro-objects (i.e. projective systems in ...) so feel it might be better to avoid the term proset here.

_Toby_:  Does one write that 'proset', 'pro-set', or both?

[[Tim Porter|Tim]]: It depends on how lazy one is feeling! I have used both. Pro-set is probably more correct, but the other does occur. It is perhaps unfortunate that poset is so well established otherwise 'porset' might be used with 'torset' etc as a consequence, but I wander!!!!

_Mike_: Good point, Tim!  Can't we just use "preorder" to mean "set equipped with a preorder"?  That usage seems to be fairly common.
