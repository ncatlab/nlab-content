By analogy with [[poset]] and [[toset]], we may define a **proset** to be a set equipped with a [[preorder]].  This terminology is less common but tempting.

[[Tim Porter]]: I see a potential problem with this terminology.   Proset has an already accepted meaning as a pro-object in Sets and that terminology dates back to early days of Grothendieck on Descent, so is well established. There are several situations in the various pages and entries that will lead to pro-objects (i.e. projective systems in ...) so feel it might be better to avoid the term proset here.

_Toby_:  Does one write that 'proset', 'pro-set', or both?

[[Tim Porter|Tim]]: It depends on how lazy one is feeling! I have used both. Pro-set is probably more correct, but the other does occur. It is perhaps unfortunate that poset is so well established otherwise 'porset' might be used with 'torset' etc as a consequence, but I wander!!!!

_Mike_: Good point, Tim!  Can't we just use "preorder" to mean "set equipped with a preorder"?  That usage seems to be fairly common.

_Toby_:  Well, you can if you want, but I don\'t.  Seriously, 'proset' is not something that I pulled out of thin air, and in fact I\'ve seen it more often than 'toset' (although that probably doesn\'t mean much given my interests).  Google `+proset preorder` to keep out the false positives and see its occasional independent usage for yourselves.  It\'s as good a term as 'poset'.

But don\'t let this matter be conflated with the weighty question of whether things should be kept at separate pages!  The distinction between [[linear order]] and [[loset]] is probably the best example of how they would look if kept separate, while [[apartness relation]] is probably the closest example of something where there is even now only one page.  (By 'things' here, I mean [[poset]]/[[partial order]] and [[toset]]/[[total order]] in addition to ones already considered.  Since a [[quasiorder]] cannot define equality, I don\'t think that [[quoset]] is necessary, and of course a [[woset]] is the same as (one kind of) [[ordinal number]], so it may not come up either; anyway, we haven\'t even written [[well-order]] yet.)
