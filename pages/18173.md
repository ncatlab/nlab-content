
the **main [[separation axioms]]** 

| number | name | statement | reformulation |
|--------|------|-----------|---------------|
| $T_0$  | [[Kolmogorov space|Kolmogorov]] | given two distinct points, at least one of them has an [[open neighbourhood]] not containing the other point |  every [[irreducible closed subset]] is the [[topological closure|closure]] of at most one point |
| $T_1$  |      | given two distinct points, both have an [[open neighbourhood]] not containing the other point | all points are [[closed point|closed]] |
| $T_2$  | [[Hausdorff topological space|Hausdorff]] | given two distinct points, they have [[disjoint subset|disjoint]] [[open neighbourhoods]] | the [[diagonal]] is a [[closed map]]  |
| $T_{\gt 2}$ |  |  $T_1$ and... | all points are [[closed point|closed]] and... |
| $T_3$  | [[regular Hausdorff topological space|regular Hausdorff]] |  ...given a point and a [[closed subset]] not containing it, they have [[disjoint subset|disjoint]] [[open neighbourhoods]]  | ...every [[neighbourhood]] of a point contains the [[topological closure|closure]] of an [[open neighbourhood]] |
| $T_4$  | [[normal Hausdorff topological space|normal Hausdorff]] | ...given two [[disjoint subset|disjoint]] [[closed subsets]], they have [[disjoint subset|disjoint]] [[open neighbourhoods]] | ...every [[neighbourhood]] of a [[closed set]] also contains the [[topological closure|closure]] of an [[open neighbourhood]] <br/> ... every pair of [[disjoint subset|disjoint]] [[closed subsets]] is separated by an [[Urysohn function]] |
