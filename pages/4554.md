## Idea

The _factorisation lemma_ is a fundamental tool in [[categories of fibrant objects]] (dually: of cofibrant objects). It mimics the _factorisation axioms_ in a [[model category]].

## Factorisation lemma

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[category of fibrant objects]].

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Fact

Let 

$$
X \overset{p_{X}}{\leftarrow} X \times Y \overset{p_{Y}}{\rightarrow} Y
$$

be a product in $\mathcal{C}$. Then $p_{X}$ and $p_{Y}$ are fibrations.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By one of the axioms for a category of fibrant objects, $\mathcal{C}$ has a final object $1$. We have the following.

1) The following diagram in $\mathcal{C}$ is a cartesian square.

$$
   \array{
      X \times Y               &  \overset{p_{Y}}{\to} & Y \\
      p_{X} \downarrow &                                      & \downarrow  \\
      X                            & \to                                 & 1 \\ 
   }
$$

2) By one of the axioms for a category of fibrant objects, the arrows $Y \to 1$ and $X \to 1$ are fibrations. 

By one of the axioms for a category of fibrant objects, it follows from 1) and 2) that $p_{X}$ and $p_{Y}$ are fibrations.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Fact

Let $X$ be an object of $\mathcal{C}$. Let 

$$
X \overset{p_{0}}{\leftarrow} X \times X \overset{p_{1}}{\rightarrow} X
$$ 

be a product in $\mathcal{C}$. By one of the axioms for a category of fibrant objects, there is a commutative diagram 

$$
   \array{
      X &  \overset{c}{\to}                      & X^I \\
          &    \underset{\Delta}{\searrow} & \downarrow e \\
          &                                                   & X \times X 
   }
$$

in $\mathcal{C}$ in which $c$ is a weak equivalence, and in which $e$ is a fibration. 

The arrow $e_0 : X^I \to X$ given by $p_0 \circ e$ is a trivial fibration. The arrow $e_1 : X^I \to X$ given by $p_1 \circ e$ is a trivial fibration.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We have the following.

1) The following diagram in $\mathcal{C}$ commutes.

$$
   \array{
      X &  \overset{c}{\to}                                         & X^I \\
          &    \underset{id_X}{\searrow}                    & \downarrow e_{0} \\
          &                                                                    & X
   }
$$

2 By one of the axioms for a category of fibrant objects, $id_X$ is a weak equivalence. 

By one of the axioms for a category of fibrant objects, we deduce from 1), 2), and the fact that $c$ is a weak equivalence, that $e_{0}$ is a weak equivalence.

An entirely analogous argument demonstrates that $e_{1}$ is a weak equivalence.

###### Proposition

Let $f : X \to Y$ be an arrow of $\mathcal{C}$. There is a commutative diagram 

$$
   \array{
      X &  \overset{j}{\to}             & Z \\
          & \underset{f}{\searrow} & \downarrow g \\
          &                                        & Y 
   }
$$
  
in $\mathcal{C}$ such that the following hold.

1) The arrow $g : Z \to Y$ is a fibration.

2) There is a trivial fibration $r : Z \to X$ such that the following diagram in $\mathcal{C}$ commutes.

$$
   \array{
      X &  \overset{j}{\to}                & Z \\
          &  \underset{id}{\searrow} & \downarrow r \\
          &                                           & X 
   }
$$

###### Proof

By one of the axioms for a category of fibrant objects, there is a commutative diagram 

$$
   \array{
      Y &  \overset{c}{\to}                    & Y^I \\
         &  \underset{\Delta}{\searrow} & \downarrow e \\
         &                                                 & Y \times Y 
   }
$$

in $\mathcal{C}$ in which $c$ is a weak equivalence, and in which $e$ is a fibration. 

Since $e$ is a fibration, there is, by one of the axioms for a category of fibrant objects, a cartesian square in $\mathcal{C}$ as follows.

$$
   \array{
      Z                            &  \overset{u_{0}}{\to} & Y^I \\
      u_{1} \downarrow &                                      & \downarrow e \\
      X \times Y               & \underset{f \times id}{\to}  & Y \times Y 
   }
$$

Let $g : Z \to Y$ be $p_{Y} \circ u_{1}$, where $p_{Y} : X \times Y \to Y$ is the projection arrow. 

Since $e$ is a fibration, we have, by one of the axioms for a category of fibrant objects, that $u_{1}$ is a fibration. By Fact 1, the arrow $p_{Y}$ is a fibration. Since a composition of fibrations in a category of fibrant objects is a fibration, we deduce that $g$ is a fibration.

The following diagram in $\mathcal{C}$ commutes.

$$
   \array{
      X                                  &  \overset{c \circ f}{\to}      & Y^I \\
      id \times f \downarrow &                                             & \downarrow e \\
      X \times Y                     & \underset{f \times id}{\to} & Y \times Y \\ 
   }
$$

By the universal property of a pullback, we deduce that there is an arrow $j : X \to Z$ such that the diagrams 

$$
   \array{
      X                                  &  \overset{f}{\to}            & Y \\
      j \downarrow                &                                        & \downarrow c \\
      Z \times Y                     & \underset{u_{0}}{\to}  & Y^I \\ 
   }
$$

and 

$$
   \array{
      X &  \overset{j}{\to}                             & Z \\
         &   \underset{id \times f}{\searrow} & \downarrow u_{1} \\
         &                                                         & X \times Y
   }
$$

in $\mathcal{C}$ commute. By the commutativity of the second of these diagrams, and the fact that the diagram 

$$
   \array{
      X &  \overset{id \times f}{\to}  & X \times Y \\
          &  \underset{id}{\searrow} & \downarrow p_{X} \\
          &                                           & X 
   }
$$

in $\mathcal{C}$ commutes, the diagram 

$$
   \array{
      X &  \overset{j}{\to}                & Z \\
         &  \underset{id}{\searrow} & \downarrow r \\
         &                                           & X 
   }
$$

in $\mathcal{C}$ commutes.

Let $r : Z \to X$ be $p_{X} \circ u_{1}$, where $p_{X} : X \times Y \to X$ is the projection arrow. 

Let 

$$
Y \overset{p_{0}}{\leftarrow} Y \times Y \overset{p_{1}}{\rightarrow} Y
$$ 

be a product diagram in $\mathcal{C}$. The following diagram in $\mathcal{C}$ is a cartesian square. 

$$
   \array{
      X \times Y               &  \overset{f \times id }{\to} & Y  \times Y \\
      p_{X} \downarrow &                                            & \downarrow p_{0} \\
      X                            &  \underset{f}{\to}              & Y \\ 
   }
$$

Thus the following diagram in $\mathcal{C}$ is a cartesian square. 

$$
   \array{
      Z                    &  \overset{u_{0}}{\to} & Y^I \\
      r \downarrow &                                      & \downarrow p_{0} \circ e \\
      X                    & \underset{f}{\to}         & Y \\ 
   }
$$

By Fact 2, the arrow $p_{0} \circ e$ is a trivial fibration. By one of the axioms for a category of fibrant objects, we deduce that $r$ is a trivial fibration.

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

That $r$ is a fibration can be demonstrated in exactly the same way as that $g$ is a fibration. It is to prove the stronger assertion that $r$ is a trivial fibration that the argument with which we concluded the proof is needed.

###### Remark

By the commutativity of the diagram

$$
   \array{
      X &  \overset{j}{\to}                & Z \\
          &  \underset{id}{\searrow} & \downarrow r \\
          &                                           & X 
   }
$$

and the fact that $r$ is a weak equivalence, we have, by one of the axioms for a category of fibrant objects, that $j$ is a weak equivalence.

+-- {: .num_cor}
###### Corollary

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category of fibrant objects. Let $\mathcal{D}$ be a [[category with weak equivalences]]. Let $F : C \to D$ be a functor with the property that, for every arrow $f$ of $\mathcal{C}$ which is a trivial fibration, we have that $F(f)$ is a weak equivalence. 

Let $w : X \to Y$ be an arrow of $\mathcal{C}$ which is a weak equivalence. Then $F(w)$ is a weak equivalence. 
=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By Proposition 3, there is a commutative diagram 

$$
   \array{
      X &  \overset{j}{\to}             & Z \\
          & \underset{w}{\searrow} & \downarrow g \\
          &                                        & Y 
   }
$$
  
in $\mathcal{C}$ such that the following hold.

1) The arrow $g : Z \to Y$ is a fibration.

2) There is a trivial fibration $r : Z \to X$ such that the following diagram in $\mathcal{C}$ commutes.

$$
   \array{
      X &  \overset{j}{\to}                & Z \\
          &  \underset{id}{\searrow} & \downarrow r \\
          &                                           & X 
   }
$$

By the commutativity of the diagram 

$$
   \array{
      X &  \overset{j}{\to}             & Z \\
          & \underset{w}{\searrow} & \downarrow g \\
          &                                        & Y 
   }
$$

and the fact that both $j$ and $w$ are weak equivalences, we have that $g$ is a weak equivalence, by one of the axioms for a category of fibrant objects.

By assumption, we thus have that $F(g) : F(Z) \to F(Y)$ is a weak equivalence. 

The following hold.

1) By the commutativity of the diagram 

$$
   \array{
      X &  \overset{j}{\to}                & Z \\
          &  \underset{id}{\searrow} & \downarrow r \\
          &                                           & X 
   }
$$

in $\mathcal{C}$, we have that the following diagram in $\mathcal{D}$ commutes.

$$
   \array{
      F(X) &  \overset{F(j)}{\to}           & F(Z) \\
             &  \underset{id}{\searrow} & \downarrow F(r) \\
             &                                           & F(X) 
   }
$$

2) Since $r$ is a trivial fibration, we have by assumption that $F(r)$ is a trivial fibration. In particular, $F(r)$ is a weak equivalence. 

3) By one of the axioms for a category with weak equivalences, we have that $id : F(X) \to F(X)$ is a weak equivalence. 

By 1), 2), 3) and one of the axioms for a category with weak equivalences, we have that $F(j)$ is a weak equivalence. 

The following diagram in $\mathcal{C}$ commutes. 

$$
   \array{
      F(X) &  \overset{F(j)}{\to}             & F(Z) \\
             & \underset{F(w)}{\searrow} & \downarrow F(g) \\
             &                                             & F(Y) 
   } 
$$

Since $F(j)$ and $F(r)$ are weak equivalences, we conclude, by one of the axioms for a category with weak equivalences, that $F(f)$ is a weak equivalence.

In other words, $F$ is a [[homotopical functor]].

###### Remark
If $C$ is the full subcategory of fibrant objects in a [[model category]], then this corollary asserts that a [[Quillen adjunction|right Quillen functor]] $F$, which by its axioms is required only to preserve fibrations and trivial fibrations, preserves also weak equivalences between fibrant objects.

###### Corollary

Let $A \to C \leftarrow B$ be a diagram between fibrant objects in a [[model category]]. Then the ordinary [[pullback]] $A \times_C^h B$

$$
  \array{
     A \times_C^h B &\to& C^I
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     A \times B &\to& C \times C
  }
$$

## Examples

* For $G$ an [[∞-group]] object in $C$ with [[delooping]] $\mathbf{B}G$, applying the factorization lemma to the point inclusion $* \to \mathbf{B}G$ yields a morphism $* \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} \mathbf{E}G \stackrel{p}{\to} \mathbf{B}G$. This exhibits a [[universal principal ∞-bundle]] for $G$.
