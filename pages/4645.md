## Idea

Ordinary [[Chern-Weil theory]] studies [[connection on a bundle|connections]] on $G$-[[principal bundle]]s over a [[Lie group]] $G$. In [[(∞,1)-category theory]] these generalize to connections on [[principal ∞-bundle]]s over [[∞-Lie group]]s $G$. **[[∞-Chern-Weil theory]]** deals with these higher connections and their relation to [[ordinary differential cohomology]].

Here we describe some introducory basics of the general theory in concrete terms.

See <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/infinity-Chern-Weil+theory#Motivation">∞-Chern-Weil theory -- motivation</a> for some motivation.

## Preparatory concepts

Two simple special cases of general $\infty$-Chern-Weil theory are obtained by

1. restricting attention to _low categorical degree_ , 

   studying [[principal bundle|principal 1-bundle]]s, [[principal 2-bundle]]s and maybe 3-bundles; in terms of [[groupoid]]s, [[2-groupoid]]s and maybe [[3-groupoid]]s;

1. restricting attention to _infinitesimal aspects_ 

   studying not [[∞-Lie groupoid]]s but just their [[∞-Lie algebroid]]s. In terms of this it is easy to raise categorical degree to $n = \infty$, but this misses various global [[cohomology|cohomological]] effects (very similar to how [[rational homotopy theory]] describes just non-torsion phenomena of genuine [[homotopy theory]]).

These are the special cases that this introduction concentrates on.

We start by describing 

* [Smooth principal n-bundles](#PrincipalNBundles)

for low $n$ in detail, connecting them to standard theory, but presenting everything in such as way as to allow straightforward generalization to the full discussion of [[principal ∞-bundle]]s.

Then in the same spirit we discuss

* [Connections on principal n-bundles](#LowDimension)

for low $n$ in a fashion that connects to the ordinary notion of [[parallel transport]] and points the way to the fully-fledged formulation in terms of the [[schreiber:path ∞-groupoid]] functor.

This leads to differential-form expressions that we shall then finally reformulate in terms of 

* [∞-Lie algebra valued connections](#LieConnections).

We end by indicating how under [[Lie integration]] this lifts to the full [[∞-Chern-Weil theory]].



### Principal $n$-bundles in low dimension {#PrincipalNBundles}

#### Ordinary smooth principal bundles {#PrincipalBundles}

Let $G$ be a [[Lie group]] and $X$ a [[smooth manifold]] (all our smooth manifolds are assumed to be finite dimensional and [[nLab:paracompact space|paracompact]]). 

We give a discussion of smooth $G$-[[principal bundle]]s on $X$ in a manner that paves the way to a straightforward generalization to a description of [[principal ∞-bundle]]s.

The first observation is that from $X$ and $G$ we naturally obtain the following [[groupoid]]s.

From the group $G$ we canonically obtain a [[groupoid]] that we write $\mathcal{B}G$ and call the [[delooping]] groupoid of $G$. Formally this groupoid is

$$
  \mathcal{B}G = (G \stackrel{\to}{\to} *)
$$

with composition canonically induced from the product in $G$. A useful cartoon of this groupoid is

$$
  \mathcal{B}G = 
  \left\{
    \array{
      && \bullet
      \\
      & {}^{\mathllap{g_1}}\nearrow 
      &=& 
      \searrow^{\mathrlap{g_2}}
      \\
      \bullet &&\stackrel{g_2 \cdot g_1 }{\to}&& \bullet
    }
  \right\}
$$

where the $g_i \in G$ are elements in the group, and the bottom morphism is labeled by forming the product in the group. (The order of the factors here is a convention that does not matter up to equivalence.)

But we get a bit more, even. Since $G$ is a [[Lie group]], there is smooth structure on $\mathcal{B}G$  that makes it a [[Lie groupoid]], an [[internal groupoid]] in the [[category]] [[Diff]] of [[smooth manifold]]s: its collections of objects (trivially) and of morphisms each form a smooth manifold, and all structure maps (source, target, identity, composition) are [[smooth function]]s. We shall write

$$
  \mathbf{B}G \in LieGrpd
$$

for $\mathcal{B}G$ regarded as equipped with this smooth structure. Here and in the following the boldface is to indicate that we have an object equipped with a bit more structure -- here: smooth structure -- than present on the object denoted by the same symbols, but without the boldface. Eventually we will make this precise by having the boldface symbols denote objects in the [[(∞,1)-topos]] [[∞LieGrpd]] which are taken by [[forgetful functor]]s to objects in [[∞Grpd]] denoted by the corresponding non-boldface symbols.[^TwoForgetful]

[^TwoForgetful]: There are actually two such forgetful functors, $\Gamma$ and $\Pi$. The first sends $\mathbf{B}G$ to $\mathcal{B}G$, which in [[topology]] is known as $K(G,1)$. The other sends $\mathbf{B}G$ to the [[classifying space]] $B G$. (see <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Lie+infinity-groupoid#GeometricRealization">∞-Lie groupoid -- geometric realization</a>). This distinction is effectively the origin of differential cohomology.

Also the smooth manifold $X$ may be regarded as a [[Lie groupoid]] -- a groupoid with only identity morphisms. Its cartoon description is simply

$$
  X = \{x \stackrel{id}{\to} x \}
  \,.
$$

But there are other groupoids associated with $X$:

Let $\{U_i \to X\}_{i \in I}$ be an [[open cover]] of $X$. To this is canonically associated the [[Cech groupoid]] $C(\{U_i\})$. Formally we may write this groupoid as

$$
  C(\{U_i\})
  =
  \left(
    \coprod_{i,j} U_i \cap U_j
    \stackrel{\overset{p_1}{\to}}{\underset{p_2}{\to}}
    \coprod_i U_i
  \right)
  \,.
$$

A useful cartoon description of this groupoid is

$$
  C(\{U_i\})
  = 
  \left\{
    \array{
       && (x,j)
       \\
       & \nearrow &=& \searrow
       \\
      (x,i) &&\to&& (x,k)
    }
  \right\}
  \,.
$$

This indicates that the objects of this groupoid are pairs $(x,i)$ consisting of a point $x \in X$ and a patch $U_i \subset X$ that contains $x$, and a morphism is a triple $(x,i,j)$ consisting of a point and _two_ patches, that both contain the point, in that $x \in U_i \cap U_j$. The triangle in the above cartoon symbolizes the evident way in which these morphisms compose. All this inherits a smooth structure from the fact that the $U_i$ are smooth manifolds and the inclusions $U_i \to X$ are [[smooth function]]s so that $C(U)$ becomes a Lie groupoid.

There is a canonical [[functor]]

$$
  C(\{U_i\}) \to X \;\; :\;\; (x,i) \mapsto x
  \,.
$$

This functor is an [[internal functor]] in [[Diff]] and moreover it is evidently [[essentially surjective functor|essentially surjective]] and [[full and faithful functor|full and faithful]]. This means that it exhibits a _weak equivalence_  of the Lie groupoids, which we write  $C(U) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}X$. However, even though the underlying functor of bare groupoids is essentially surjective and full and faithful and therefore is guaranteed to have a homotopy-inverse functor, that homotopy-inverse never has smooth component maps, unless $X$ itself is a [[Cartesian space]] and the chosen cover is trivial. 

We do however want to think of $C(U)$ as being equivalent to $X$ even as a Lie groupoid. And moreover, we shall think of $C(U)$ as a _good_ equivalent replacement of $X$ if it comes from a cover that is in fact a [[good open cover]] in that all its finite intersections $U_{i_0 \cdots i_k} := U_{i_0} \cap \cdots \cap U_{i_k}$ are [[diffeomorphic]] to the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^{dim X}$. 

We shall discuss later in which precise sense this condition makes $C(U)$ _good_ in the sense that smooth functors out of $C(U)$ model the correct notion of morphism out of $X$ in the context of smooth groupoids (namely it will mean that $C(U)$ is cofibrant in a suitable [[model category]] structure on the category of Lie groupoids). The formalization of this statement is what [[(∞,1)-topos]] theory is all about, to which we will come. For the moment we shall be content with accepting this as an ad hoc statement.

We now observe then that a [[functor]]

$$
  g : C(U) \to \mathbf{B}G
$$

is given in components precisely by a collection of functions

$$
  \{g_{i j} : U_{i j} \to G \}_{i,j \in I}
$$

such that on each $U_i \cap U_k \cap U_j$ the equality $g_{j k} g_{i j}  = g_{i k}$ of functions holds:

$$
  \left(
    \array{
       && (x,j)
       \\
       & \nearrow && \searrow
       \\
      (x,i) &&\to&& (x,k)
    }
  \right)
  \mapsto
  \left(
    \array{
       && \bullet
       \\
       & {}^{\mathllap{g_{i j}(x)}}\nearrow
       && \searrow^{\mathrlap{g_{j k}(x)}}
       \\
      \bullet &&\stackrel{g_{i k}(x)}{\to}&& \bullet
    }
  \right)
  \,.
$$

Demanding that the functor $g$ respects the smooth structure means that the functions $g_{i j}$ are [[smooth function]]s. Smooth functions $\{g_{i j}\}$ satisfying $g_{i j}  g_{j k} = g_{i k}$ are precisely in bijection with smooth functors $g : C(U) \to X$.

It is well known that such collections of functions characterize $G$-[[principal bundle]]s on $X$. While this is a classical fact, we shall now describe a way to derive it that is true to the Lie-groupoid-context and that will make clear how smooth principal $\infty$-bundles work.

First observe that in total we have discussed so far [[span]]s of smooth functors of the form

$$
  \array{
     C(U) &\stackrel{g}{\to}& \mathbf{B}G
     \\
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
     \\
     X
  }
  \,.
$$

Such spans of functors, whose left leg is a weak equivalence, are sometimes known as [[anafunctor]]s. We are to think of these as concrete _models_ for more intrinsically defined morphisms $X\to \mathbf{B}G$ in the $(\infty,1)$-topos of Lie groupoids. 

Now consider yet another Lie groupoid canonically associated with $G$: we shall write $\mathbf{E}G$ for the groupoid whose formal description is

$$
  \mathbf{E}G  = 
  \left(
    G \times G \stackrel{\overset{\cdot}{\to}}{\underset{p_1}{\to}} G 
  \right)
$$

with the evident composition operation. The cartoon description of this groupoid is

$$
  \mathbf{E}G
  = 
  \left\{
     \array{
        && g_2
        \\
        & \nearrow &=& \searrow
        \\
        g_1 &&\stackrel{}{\to}&& g_3
     }
  \right\}
  \,,
$$

where we don't need to further label the morphisms, since there is a _unique_ morphism for every ordered pair $(g_1, g_2)$ of elements in $G$. This again inherits an evident smooth structure from the smooth structure of $G$ and hence becomes a Lie groupoid.

There is an evident [[forgetful functor]]

$$
  \mathbf{E}G \to \mathbf{B}G
$$

which sends

$$
  (g_1 \to g_2) \mapsto (\bullet \stackrel{g_2^{-1} g_1}{\to} \bullet)
  \,.
$$

Consider then the [[pullback]] diagram

$$
  \array{
     \tilde P &\to& \mathbf{E}G
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     C(U) &\stackrel{g}{\to}& \mathbf{B}G
     \\
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
     \\
     X
  }
$$

in the category $Grpd(Diff)$.


The object $\tilde P$ is the Lie groupoid whose cartoon description is


$$
  \array{
    \tilde P = 
    \left\{
       \array{
          (x,i,g_1) &&\stackrel{}{\to}&& (x,j,g_2 = g_1 g_{i j}(x))
       }
   \right\}
  }
  \,,
$$

where there is a unique morphism as indicated, whenever the group labels match as indicated. Due to this uniqueness, this Lie groupoid is weakly equivalent to one that comes just from a manifold $P$ (it is 0-[[truncated]])

$$
  \tilde P \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} P
  \,.
$$

This $P$ is traditionally written as

$$
  P = \left( \coprod_{i} U_i \times G \right)_{\sim}
  \,,
$$

where the [[equivalence relation]] is precisely that exhibited by the morphisms in $\tilde P$. This is the traditional way to construct a $G$-[[principal bundle]] from cocycle functions $(g_{i j})$. We may think of $\tilde P$ as _being_ $P$. It is a particular _representative_ of $P$ in the $(\infty,1)$-topos of Lie groupoids.

While it is easy to see in components that the $P$ obtained this way does indeed have a principal $G$-[[action]] on it, for later generalizations it is crucial that we can also recover this in a general abstract way. For notice that there is a canonical [[action]]

$$
  (\mathbf{E}G) \times G \to \mathbf{E}G
  \,.
$$

Then consider the [[pasting]] diagram of pullbacks

$$
  \array{
     \tilde P \times G &\to& \mathbf{E}G \times G
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     \tilde P &\to& \mathbf{E}G
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     C(U) &\stackrel{g}{\to}& \mathbf{B}G
     \\
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
     \\
     X
  }
  \,.
$$

The morphism $\tilde P \times G \to \tilde P$ is the principal $G$-[[action]] of $G$ on $\tilde P$.


In summary we find

###### Observation

There is an [[equivalence of categories]]

$$
  SmoothFunc(C(\{U_i\}), \mathbf{B}G)
  \simeq
  G Bund(X)
$$

between the [[nLab:functor category]] of smooth functors and smooth natural transformations, and the groupoid of smooth $G$-[[nLab:principal bundle]]s on $X$. 

=--

It is no coincidence that this statement looks akin to the maybe more familiar statement which says that _equivalence classes_ of $G$-principal bundles are classified by [[homotopy]]-classes of morphisms of [[topological space]]s 

$$
  \pi_0 Top(X, \mathcal{B}G)
  \simeq
  \pi_0 G Bund(X)
  \,,
$$

where $\mathcal{B}G \in $ [[Top]] is the topological [[classifying space]] of $G$. In fact the category [[Top]] of topological spaces, regarded as an [[(∞,1)-category]], is the archetypical [[(∞,1)-topos]] the way that [[Set]] is the archetypical [[topos]]. And it is equivalent to [[∞Grpd]], the $(\infty,1)$-category of bare [[∞-groupoid]]s. What we are seeing above is a first indication of how [[cohomology]] of bare $\infty$-groupoids is lifted to a richer $(\infty,1)$-topos to cohomology of $\infty$-groupoids with extra structure.

In fact, all of the statements that we considered so far becomes conceptually _simpler_ in the $(\infty,1)$-topos. We had already remarked that the [[anafunctor]] span $X \stackrel{\simeq}{\leftarrow} C(U) \stackrel{g}{\to} \mathbf{B}G$ is really a model for what is simply a direct morphism $X \to \mathbf{B}G$ in the $(\infty,1)$-topos. But more is true: that pullback of $\mathbf{E}G$ which we considered is just a model for the [[homotopy pullback]] of just the _point_

#### Cech cocycles {#Cech2Cocycles}

The discussion above of $G$-principal bundles was all based on the [[Lie groupoid]]s $\mathbf{B}G$ and $\mathbf{E}G$ that are canonically induced by a [[Lie group]] $G$. We now discuss the case where $G$ is generalized to a [[Lie 2-group]]. The above discussion will go through essentially verbatim, only that we pick up [[2-morphism]]s everywhere. This is the first step towards higher Chern-Weil theory. The resulting generalization of the notion of principal bundle is that of [[principal 2-bundle]]. For historical reasons these are known in the literature often as [[gerbe]]s or as [[bundle gerbe]]s. 

Write $U(1) = \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ for the [[circle group]]. We have already seen above the groupoid $\mathbf{B}U(1)$ obtained from this. But since $U(1)$ is an [[abelian group]] this groupoid has the special property that it still has itself the structure of an [[group object]]. This makes it what is called a [[2-group]]. Accordingly, we may form its [[delooping]] once more to arrive at a [[Lie 2-groupoid]] $\mathbf{B}^2 U(1)$.

Its cartoon picture is

$$
  \mathbf{B}^2 U(1) = 
  \left\{
     \array{
        && \bullet
        \\
        & {}^{\mathllap{Id}}\nearrow 
        & \Downarrow^{\mathrlap{g}}& 
        \searrow^{\mathrlap{Id}}
        \\
        \bullet &&\underset{Id}{\to}&& \bullet
     }
  \right\}
$$

for $g \in U(1)$. Both [[horizontal composition]] as well as [[vertical composition]] of the 2-morphisms is given by the product in $U(1)$.

Let again $X$ be a smooth manifold with [[good open cover]] $\{U_i \to X\}$. The corresponding [[Cech groupoid]] we may also think of as a Lie 2-groupoid, 

$$
  C(U) = 
  \left(
     \coprod_{i, j, k} U_i \cap U_j \cap U_k
     \stackrel{\to}{\stackrel{\to}{\to}}
     \coprod_{i, j}
     U_i \cap U_j
     \stackrel{\to}{\to}
     \coprod_i U_i
  \right)
  \,.
$$

What we see here are the first stages of the full [[Cech nerve]] of the cover. Eventually we will be looking at this object in its entirety, since for all degrees this is always a _good_ replacement of the manifold $X$.

So we look now at 2-[[anafunctor]]s given by spans 

$$
  \array{
    C(U) &\stackrel{g}{\to}& \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    \\
    X
  }
$$

of internal [[2-functor]]s. These will model direct morphisms $X \to \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)$ in the $(\infty,1)$-topos. It is straightforward to read off that the smooth 2-functor $g : C(U) \to \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)$ is given by the data of a 2-cocycle in the [[Cech cohomology]] of $X$ with coefficients in $U(1)$. On [[2-morphism]]s it specifies an assignment

$$
  g 
   \;\; : \;\;
   \left(
     \array{
       && (x,j)
       \\
       & \nearrow &\Downarrow& \searrow
       \\
      (x,i) &&\to&& (x,k)
     }
   \right)
   \;\;\;
   \mapsto
   \;\;\;
  \left\{
     \array{
        && \bullet
        \\
        & {}^{\mathllap{Id}}\nearrow 
        & \Downarrow^{\mathrlap{g_{i j k}(x)}}& 
        \searrow^{\mathrlap{Id}}
        \\
        \bullet &&\underset{Id}{\to}&& \bullet
     }
  \right\}    
$$

that is given by a collection of smooth functions

$$
  (g_{i j k} : U_i \cap U_j \cap U_k \to U(1))
$$

and on [[3-morphism]]s it gives a constraint on these functions, since there are only identity 3-morphisms in $\mathbf{B}^2 U(1)$

$$
  \begin{aligned}
  \left(
  \array{
    (x,j) &&\stackrel{g_2}{\to}&& (x,k)
    \\
    \uparrow^{} &&{}^{}\nearrow&& \downarrow^{}
    \\
    (x,i)
    &&\stackrel{}{\to}&& (x,l)
  }
  \;\;\;\;
  \Rightarrow
  \;\;\;\;   
  \array{
    (x,j) &&\stackrel{}{\to}&& (x,k)
    \\
    \uparrow^{} &&\searrow^{}&& \downarrow^{}
    \\
    (x,i)
    &&\stackrel{}{\to}&& (x,l)
  }
  \right)
  \\
  & \mapsto
  \left(
  \array{
    \bullet &&\stackrel{}{\to}&& \bullet
    \\
    \uparrow^{} &\Downarrow^{g_{i j k}(x)}
    &{}^{}\nearrow&\Downarrow^{g_{i k l}(x)}& 
    \downarrow^{}
    \\
    \bullet
    &&\stackrel{}{\to}&& \bullet
  }
  \;\;\;\;
  \stackrel{Id}{\Rightarrow}
  \;\;\;\;   
  \array{
    \bullet &&\stackrel{}{\to}&& \bullet
    \\
    \uparrow^{} &\Downarrow^{g_{i j l}(x)}
    &\searrow^{}&\Downarrow^{g_{j k l}(x)}& \downarrow^{}
    \\
    \bullet
    &&\stackrel{}{\to}&& \bullet
  }
  \right)
  \end{aligned}  
  \,.
$$

This cocycle condition

$$
  g_{i j k} \cdot g_{i k l} = g_{i j l} \cdot g_{j k l}
$$

is that known from [[Cech cohomology]].

Following the general abstract formalism, it is again straightforward to find the total space of the $\mathbf{B}U(1)$-[[principal 2-bundle]] that is classified by such a cocycle.

For that we need to get the 2-groupoid $\mathbf{B}^2 U(1)$ and the 2-functor $\mathbf{E} \mathbf{B} U(1) \to \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)$ that exhibits the [[universal principal ∞-bundle|universal principal 2-bundle]] over $U(1)$.

It is easy to guess what this should be, but there is also a systematic way to derive this, which works in full generality:


#### Universal principal $n$-bundles {#UniversalnBundle}

For $G$ any group object, the [[universal principal ∞-bundle]] is a good replacement for the point inclusion $* \to \mathbf{B}G$.

Write 

$$
  \mathbf{B}G^I
  :=
  [\Delta[1], \mathbf{B}G]
$$

for the [[path space object]] of $\mathbf{B}G$. For $G$ an ordinary group this is also known as the [[arrow category]] of $\mathbf{B}G$.

There are two canonical projections $d_i : \mathbf{B}G^I \to \mathbf{B}G$. 
Define $\mathbf{E}G$ to be the [[pullback]]

$$
  \array{
    \mathbf{E}G &\to& *
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbf{B}G^I &\stackrel{d_1}{\to}& \mathbf{B}G
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{d_0}}
    \\
    \mathbf{B}G
  }
  \,.
$$

For $G$ an ordinary Lie group, this reproduces the groupoid $\mathbf{E}G$ discussed [above](#PrincipalBundles). 

For detailed illustration of what $\mathbf{E}G$ looks like for $G$ a [[2-group]], see ([RobertsSchreiber](#RobertsSchreiber)).


#### Circle $n$-bundles and bundle $(n-1)$-gerbes

Let $g : C(U) \to \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)$ be a Cech cocycle as [above](#Cech2Cocycles). By the discussion of [universal n-bundles](#UniversalnBundle) we find the corresponding total space object as the [[pullback]] 

$$
  \array{
    \tilde P &\to& \mathbf{E}\mathbf{B}U(1)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    C(U) &\stackrel{g}{\to}& \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    \\
    X
  }
  \,.
$$

Unwinding what this means, we see that  $\tilde P$ is the 2-groupoid whose objects are that of $C(U)$, whose morphisms are finite sequences of morphisms in $C(U)$,each equipped with a label $c \in U(1)$, and whose 2-morphisms are generated from those that look like

$$
  \array{
    && (x,j)
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{c_1}}\nearrow &\Downarrow^{g_{i j k}(x)}& \searrow^{\mathrlap{c_2}}
    \\
    (x,i) &&\stackrel{c_3}{\to}&& (x,k)
  }
$$

subject to the condition that

$$
  c_1 \cdot c_2 = c_3 \cdot g_{i j k}(x)
$$

in $U(1)$. As before for principal 1-bundles $P$, where we saw that the analogous pullback 1-groupoid $\tilde P$ was equivalent to the 0-groupoid $P$, here we see that this 2-groupoid is equivalent to the 1-groupoid 

$$
  P = 
  \left(
    C(U)_1 \times U(1) \stackrel{\to}{\to}
    C(U)
  \right)
$$ 

with composition law

$$
  ((x,i) \stackrel{c_1}{\to} (x,j) \stackrel{c_2}{\to} (x,k))
  =
  ((x,i) \stackrel{(c_1 \cdot c_2 \cdot g_{i j k }(x))}{\to}
  (x,k))
$$

This is a [[groupoid cohomology|groupoid central extension]]

$$
  \mathbf{B}U(1) \to P \to C(U) \times X
  \,.
$$

Centrally extended groupoids of this kind are known in the literature as [[bundle gerbe]]s (over the [[surjective submersion]] $Y = U \to X$ ). They may be thought of as given by a [[line bundle]] 

$$
  \array{
     L
     \\
     \downarrow
     \\
     (C(U)_1 = U \times_X U) &\stackrel{\to}{\to}& (C(U)_0 = U)
     \\
     && \downarrow
     \\
     && X
  }
$$

over the space $C(U)_1$ of [[morphism]]s, and a line bundle morphism

$$

  \mu_g : \pi_1^* L \otimes \pi_2^* L \to \pi_1^* L
$$

that satisfies an evident [[associativity]] law, equivalent to the cocycle codition on $g$.

So we see that bundle gerbes are presentations of Lie groupoids that are total spaces of $\mathbf{B}U(1)$-[[principal 2-bundle]]s.

This is clearly the beginning of a pattern. Next we can form one more [[delooping]] and produce the Lie 3-groupoid $\mathbf{B}^3 U(1)$. A cocycle $C(U) \to \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)$ classifies a _circle 3-bundle_  . The total space object $\tilde P$ in the pullback

$$
  \array{
    \tilde P &\to& \mathbf{E}\mathbf{B}^2 U(1)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    C(U) &\stackrel{g}{\to}& \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    \\
    X
  }
$$

is essentially what is known as a [[bundle 2-gerbe]].




#### String 2-bundles and nonabelian bundle gerbes

Above we saw $\mathbf{B}U(1)$-[[principal 2-bundle]]s. The groupoid $\mathbf{B}U(1)$ is a special case of what is called a [[Lie 2-group]], which is a [[group object]] $G$ in Lie groupoids. 

An example of a nonabelian Lie 2-group is the [[string Lie 2-group]] $String$, which sits in a [[fiber sequence]] of Lie 2-groups of the form

$$
  \mathbf{B}U(1) \to String \to Spin
  \,.
$$


A quick way to understand the meaning of this 2-group is from the fact that:

**Fact.** Given a [[spin group]]-[[principal bundle]] $P \to X$, its [[Pontryagin class]] classifies a _circle 3-bundle_  (a [[bundle 2-gerbe]]) called the [[Chern-Simons circle 3-bundle]]. The nontriviality of this is precisely the obstruction to lifting the $Spin$-principal bundle $P$ to a $String$-principal 2-bundle.

Again, we can construct Lie 2-groupoids equivalent to the total space of a $String$-principal 2-bundle classified by a cocycle $g : C(U) \to \mathbf{B}String$ by forming the pullback.
 
$$
  \array{
    \tilde P &\to& \mathbf{E}String
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    C(U) &\stackrel{g}{\to}& \mathbf{B} String
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    \\
    X
  }
$$

These groupoids $\tilde P$ are in the literature known as [[nonabelian bundle gerbe]].


#### A model for principal $\infty$-bundles {#ModelForPrincipalInfinityBundle}

We have seen [above](#PrincipalBundles) that the theory of ordinary smooth [[principal bundle]]s is naturally situated within the context of [[Lie groupoid]]s, and [then](#Cech2Cocycles) that the theory of smooth [[principal 2-bundle]]s is naturally situated within the theory of [[Lie 2-groupoid]]s. This is clearly the beginning of a pattern in [[higher category theory]] where in the next step we see smooth [[3-groupoid]]s and so on. Finally the general theory of [[principal ∞-bundle]]s deals with smooth [[∞-groupoid]]s. 

A comprehensive discussion of such [[∞-Lie groupoid]]s is given there. In this introduction here we will just briefly describe the main _tool_ for _modelling_ these and describe principal $\infty$-bundles in this model. See also [[models for ∞-stack (∞,1)-toposes]].

We first look at bare [[∞-groupoid]]s and then discuss how to equip these with smooth structure.

An [[∞-groupoid]] is first of all supposed to be a structure that has [[k-morphism]]s for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$, which for $k \geq 1$ go between $(k-1)$-morphisms. A useful tool for organizing such collections of morphisms is the notion of a [[simplicial set]]. This is a [[functor]] on the [[opposite category]] of the  [[simplex category]] $\Delta$, whose objects are the abstract cellular $k$-[[simplex|simplices]], denoted $[k]$ or $\Delta[k]$ for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$, and whose morphisms $\Delta[k_1] \to \Delta[k_2]$ are all ways of mapping these into each other. So we think of such a simplicial set given by a functor

$$
  K : \Delta^{op} \to Set
$$

as specifying

* a set $[0] \mapsto K_0$ of [[object]]s;

* a set $[1] \mapsto K_1$ of [[morphism]];

* a set $[2] \mapsto K_2$ of [[2-morphism]];

* a set $[3] \mapsto K_3$ of [[3-morphism]];

and generally

* a set $[k] \mapsto K_k$ of [[k-morphism]]s

as well as specifying

* functions $([n] \hookrightarrow [n+1]) \mapsto K_{n+1} \to K_n$
  that send $n+1$-morphisms to their boundary $n$-morphisms;

* functionss $([n+1] \to [n]) \mapsto K_{n} \to K_{n+1}$
  that send $n$-morphisms to [[identity]] $(n+1)$-morphisms
  on them.

The fact that $K$ is supposed to be a [[functor]] enforces that these assignments of sets and functions are consistent with our interpretation of them as sets of $k$-morphisms and source and target maps between these, in that for instance it enforces that the 1-morphisms between which a 2-morphisms goes suitably go between coinciding objects. These are called the [[simplicial identities]].

But apart from this source-target matching, a generic simplicial set does not yet encode a notion of [[composition]] of these morphisms. 

For instance for $\Lambda^1[2]$ the simplicial set consisting of two attached 1-cells 

$$
  \Lambda^1[2] = \left\{
    \array{
       && 1
       \\
       & \nearrow && \searrow
       \\
       0 &&&& 2
    }
  \right\}
$$

and for $(f,g) : \Lambda^1[2] \to K$ an image of this situation in $K$, hence a pair $x_0 \stackrel{f}{\to} x_1 \stackrel{g}{\to} x_2$ of two _composable_ 1-morphisms in $K$, we want to demand that there exists a third 1-morphisms in $K$ that may be thought of as the [[composition]] $x_0 \stackrel{h}{\to} x_2$ of $f$ and $g$. But since we are working in [[higher category theory]] (and not to be [[evil]]), we want to identify this composite only up to a [[2-morphism]] equivalence

$$
    \array{
       && 1
       \\
       & {}^{\mathllap{f}}\nearrow &\Downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}& 
       \searrow^{\mathrlap{g}}
       \\
       x_0 &&\stackrel{h}{\to}&& x_2
    }
  \,.
$$

From the picture it is clear that this is equivalent to demanding that for $\Lambda^1[2] \hookrightarrow \Delta[2]$ the obvious inclusion of the two abstract composable 1-morphisms into the 2-simplex we have a diagram of morphisms of simplicial sets

$$
  \array{
    \Lambda^1[2] &\stackrel{(f,g)}{\to}& K
    \\
    \downarrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\exists h}}
    \\
    \Delta[2]
  }
  \,.
$$

A simplicial set where for all such $(f,g)$ such $h$ exists may be thought of as a collection of higher morphisms that is equipped with a notion of composition of adjacent 1-morphisms. 

For the purpose of describing [[groupoid]]al composition, we now want that this composition operation has all [[inverse]]s. For that purpose, notice that for 

$$
  \Lambda^2[2] = \left\{
    \array{
       && 1
       \\
       & && \searrow
       \\
       0 &&\to&& 2
    }
  \right\}
$$

the simplicial set consisting of two 1-morphisms that touch at their end, hence for 

$$
  (g,h) : \Lambda^2[2] \to K
$$

two such 1-morphisms in $K$, then if $g$ had an inverse $g^{-1}$ we could use the above compostion operation to compose that with $h$ and thereby find a morphism $f$ connecting the sources of $h$ and $g$. This being the case is evidently equivalent to the existence of diagrams of morphisms of simplicial sets

$$
  \array{
    \Lambda^2[2] &\stackrel{(g,h)}{\to}& K
    \\
    \downarrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\exists f}}
    \\
    \Delta[2]
  }
  \,.
$$

Demanding that all such diagrams exist is therefore demanding that we have on 1-morphisms a composition operation with inverses in $K$. 

In order for this to qualify as an $\infty$-groupoid, this composition operation needs to satisfy an [[associativity law]] up to [[2-morphism]]s, which means that we can find the relevant [[associahedron]]s in $K$. These in turn need to be connected by _pentagonators_ and ever so on.  It is a nontrivial but true and powerful fact, that it turns out that all these [[coherence]] conditions are captured by generalizing the above conditions to all dimensions in the evident way:

let $\Lambda^i[n] \hookrightarrow \Delta[n]$ be the simplicial set -- called the $i$th $n$-[[horn]] -- that consists of all cells of the $n$-[[simplex]] $\Delta[n]$ except the interior $n$-morphism and the $i$th $(n-1)$-morphism.

Then a simplicial set is called a [[Kan complex]], if for all images $f : \Lambda^i[n] \to K$ of such horns in $K$, the missing two cells can be found in $K$- in that we can always find a _horn filler_ $\sigma$ in the diagram

$$
  \array{
     \Lambda^i[n] &\stackrel{f}{\to}& K
     \\
     \downarrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\sigma}}
     \\
     \Delta[n]
  }
  \,.
$$

The basic example is the [[nerve]] $N(C) \in sSet$ of an ordinary [[groupoid]] $C$, which is the simplicial set with $N(C)_k$ precisely the set of sequences of $k$ composable morphisms in $C$. The nerve operation is a [[full and faithful functor]]  from 1-groupoids into Kan complexes and hence may be thought of as embedding 1-groupoids in the context of general [[∞-groupoid]]s.

But we need a bit more than just bare [[∞-groupoid]]s. In generalizating to [[Lie groupoid]]s, we need [[∞-Lie groupoid]]s. A useful way to encode that an $\infty$-groupoid has extra structure modeled on geometric test objects that themselves form a category $C$ is to remember the rule which for each test space $U$ in $C$ produces the $\infty$-groupoid of $U$-parameterized families of $k$-morphisms in $K$.  For instance for an [[∞-Lie groupoid]] we could test with each [[Cartesian space]] $U = \mathbb{R}^n$ and find the $\infty$-groupoids $K(U)$ of smooth $n$-parameter families of $k$-morphisms in $K$.

This data of $U$-families arranges itself into a [[presheaf]] with values in Kan complexes

$$
  K : C^{op} \to KanCplx \hookrightarrow sSet
$$

hence with values in simplicial sets. This is equivalently a [[simplicial presheaf]] of sets. The [[functor category]] $[C^{op}, sSet]$ on the [[opposite category]] of the category of test objects $C$ serves as a model for the [[(∞,1)-category]] of $\infty$-groupoids with $C$-structure.

While there are no [[higher morphism]]s in this functor 1-category that could for instance witness that two $\infty$-groupoids are not [[isomorphic]], but still [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]], it turns out that all one needs in order to reconstruct _all_ these higher morphisms (up to equivalence!) is just the information of which morphisms of simplicial presheaves would become invertible if we were keeping track of higher morphism. These would-be invertible morphisms are called _weak equivalences_ and denoted $K_1 \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} K_2$. 

For common choices of $C$ there is a well-understood way to define the weak equivalences $W \subset mor [C^{op}, sSet]$, and equipped with this information the category of simplicial presheaves becomes a _[[category with weak equivalences]]_ . There is a well-developed but somewhat intricate theory of how exactly this 1-cagtegorical data models the full higher category of structured groupoids that we are after, but for our purposes we essentially only need to work inside the [[category of fibrant objects]] of a [[model category]] structure [[model structure on simplicial presheaves|on simplicial presheaves]], which in practice amounts to the fact that we use the following three basic constructions:

1. **[[∞-anafunctor]]s** -- A morphisms $X \to Y$ between $\infty$-groupoids with $C$-structure is not just a morphism $X\to Y$ in $[C^{op}, sSet]$, but is a [[span]] of such ordinary morphisms

   $$
     \array{  
        \hat X &\to& Y
        \\
        \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
        \\
        X
     }
   $$

   where the left leg is a weak equivalence. This is sometimes called an _$\infty$-anafunctor_ from $X$ to $Y$.
 
1. **[[homotopy pullback]]** -- For $A \to B \stackrel{p}{\leftarrow} C$ a [[diagram]], the [[(∞,1)-pullback]] of it is the ordinary [[pullback]] in $[C^{op}, sSet]$ of a replacement diagram $A \to B \stackrel{\hat p}{\leftarrow} \hat C$, where $\hat p$ is a _good replacement_  of $p$ in the sense of the following...

1. **[[factorization lemma]]** -- For $p : C \to B$ a morphism in $[C^{op}, sSet]$, _good replacement_ $\hat p : \hat C \to B$ is given by the total vertical morphism in the ordinary [[pullback]] diagram

   $$
     \array{
       \hat C &\to& C
       \\
       \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
       \\
       B^{\Delta[1]} &\to& B
       \\
       \downarrow
       \\
       B
     }
     \,.
   $$

  
The [[principal ∞-bundle]]s that we wish to model are already the main and simplest example of the application of these three items: 

Consider an object $\mathbf{B}G \in [C^{op}, sSet]$ which is an $\infty$-groupoid with a single object, so that we may think of it as the [[delooping]] of an [[∞-group]] $G$, let $*$ be the point and $* \to \mathbf{B}G$ the unique inclusion map. The _good replacement_ of this inclusion morphism is the $G$-[[universal principal ∞-bundle]] $\mathbf{E}G \to \mathbf{B}G$ gives by the pullback diagram
  
$$
  \array{ 
    \mathbf{E}G &\to& *
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbf{B}G^I &\to& \mathbf{B}G
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
     \mathbf{B}G
   }
$$

An [[∞-anafunctor]] $X \stackrel{\simeq}{\leftarrow} \hat X \to \mathbf{B}G$ we call a [[cocycle]] on $X$ with coefficients in $G$, and the [[(∞,1)-pullback]] $P$ of the point along this cocycle, which by the above discussion is the ordinary [[limit]]


$$
  \array{ 
    P &\to& \mathbf{E}G &\to& *
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}G^I &\to& \mathbf{B}G
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \hat X &\stackrel{g}{\to}& \mathbf{B}G
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    \\
    X
  }
$$

we call the [[principal ∞-bundle]] $P \to X$ classified by the cocycle.

It is now evident that our discussion of ordinary smooth principal bundles [above](#PrincipalBundles) is the special case of this for $\mathbf{B}G$ the [[nerve]] of the one-object groupoid associated with the ordinary group $G$.

So we find the complete generalization of the situation that we already indicated there, which is summarized in the following diagram:

$$
  \array{
     \vdots && \vdots
     \\
     \tilde P \times G &\to& \mathbf{E}G \times G
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     \tilde P &\to& \mathbf{E}G
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     C(U) &\stackrel{g}{\to}& \mathbf{B}G
     \\
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
     \\
     X
     \\
     {}
     \\
     {}
     \\
     & in\;the\;model\;category &
  }
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \array{
     \vdots && \vdots
     \\
     P \times G &\to& G
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     P &\to& * 
     \\
     \downarrow &\swArrow_{\simeq}& \downarrow 
     \\
     X &\stackrel{}{\to}& \mathbf{B}G
     \\
     .
     \\
     .
     \\
     \\
     \\
     & in\;the\;(\infty,1)-topos
  }
  \,.
$$



### Parallel transport in low dimensions {#LowDimension}

With a decent handle on principal $\infty$-bundles as described [above](#ModelForPrincipalInfinityBundle) we now turn to the description of [[connection on an ∞-bundle|connections on ∞-bundles]]. It will turn out that the above [[cocycle]]-description of $G$-principal $\infty$-bundles in terms of  [[∞-anafunctor]] $X \stackrel{\simeq}{\leftarrow} \hat X \stackrel{g}{\to} \mathbf{B}G$ has, under mild conditions, a natural generalization where $\mathbf{B}G$ is replaced by a [[concrete sheaf|non-concrete]] [[∞-Lie groupoid]] $\mathbf{B}G_{conn}$ which we may think of as the [[∞-groupoid of ∞-Lie algebra valued forms]]. This comes with a canonical map $\mathbf{B}G_{conn} \to \mathbf{B}G$ and an $\infty$-connection $\nabla$ on the $\infty$-bundle classified by $g$ is simply a lift

$$
  \array{
    && \mathbf{B}G_{conn}
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{\nabla}}\nearrow & \downarrow
    \\
    \hat X &\stackrel{g}{\to}& \mathbf{B}G
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    \\
    X
  }
  \,.
$$

In the language of [[∞-stack]]s we may think of $\mathbf{B}G$ as the $\infty$-stack (on [[CartSp]]) or $\infty$-prestack (on [[Diff]]) $G TrivBund(-)$ of _trivial_ $G$-principal bundles, and of $\mathbf{B}G_{conn}$ correspondingly as the object $G TrivBund_{\nabla}(- )$ of  trivial $G$-principal bundles with (non-trivial) connection. In this sense the statement that $\infty$-connections are cocycles with coefficients in some $\mathbf{B}G_{conn}$ is a tautology. The real questions are:

1. What is $\mathbf{B}G_{conn}$ in concrete formulas?

1. Why are these formulas what they are? What is the general abstract concept of an $\infty$-connection? What are its defining abstract properties?

A comprehensive answer to the second question is provided by the general abstract concept of [[schreiber:differential cohomology in an (∞,1)-topos]]. Here in this introduction we will not go into the full abstract theory, but using classical tools we get pretty close. What we describe is a generalization of the concept of [[parallel transport]] to [[higher parallel transport]]. As we shall see, this is naturally expressed in terms of [[∞-anafunctor]]s out of [[path n-groupoid]]s. This reflects how the full abstract theory arises in the context of an [[∞-connected (∞,1)-topos]] that comes canonically with a notion of [[schreiber:path ∞-groupoid]]s.


Below we begin the discussion of $\infty$-connection by reviewing the classical theory of [[connection on a bundle]] in a way that will make its generalization to higher connections relatively straightforward:

* [Connections on principal bundles](#ConnectionOnPrincipalBundle).

In an analogous way we can then describe certain classes of [[connections on a 2-bundle]] -- subsuming the notion of [[connection on a bundle gerbe]] -- in

* [Connections on 2-bundles](#ConnectionOn2Bundle).

With that in hand we then revisit the discussion of connections on ordinary bundles. By associating to each bundle with connection its corresponding _curvature 2-bundle with connection_ we obtain a more refined description of connections on bundles, one that is naturally adapted to the construction of [[curvature characteristic form]]s in the [[Chern-Weil homomorphism]]:

* [Curvature characteristics of 1-bundles](#CurvatureCharacteristicsI).

This turns out to be the kind of formulation of [[connections on an ∞-bundle]] that drops out of the general abstract theory described at [[∞-Chern-Weil homomorphism]]. In classical terms, its full formulation involves the description of [[circle n-bundles with connection]] in terms of [[Deligne cohomology]] and the description of the [[∞-groupoid of ∞-Lie algebra valued forms]] in terms of [[dg-algebra]] homomorphisms. The first aspect we discuss in 

* [Circle n-bundles with connection](#c)

the second in

* [∞-Lie algebra valued connections](#LieConnections).

The combination of these two aspects yields naturally an explicit model for the [[Chern-Weil homomorphism]] and its generalization to higher bundles:

* [The ∞-Chern-Weil homomorphism](#ChernWeilHomomorphism)

Taken together, these constructions allow us to express a good deal of the general $\infty$-Chern-Weil theory with classical tools. As an example, we describe how the classical Cech-Deligne cocycle construction of the refined [[Chern-Weil homomorphism]] (by [BrylinskiMacLaughlin](#BrylinskiMacLaughlin)) drops out from these constructions:

* [Example: The Chern-Simons circle 3-bundle](#ChernSimons3Bund).



#### Connections on a principal bundle {#ConnectionOnPrincipalBundle}

There are different equivalent definitions of the classical notion of a connection. One that is useful for our purposes is that a connection $\nabla$ on a $G$-principal bundle $P \to X$ is a rule $tra_\nabla$ for [[parallel transport]] along paths: a rule that assigns to each path $\gamma : [0,1] \to X$ a morphism $tra_\nabla(\gamma) : P_x \to P_y$ between the fibers of the bundle above the endpoints of these paths, in a compatible way:


$$
  \array{
    P_x &\stackrel{tra_\nabla(\gamma)}{\to}& P_y
    &\stackrel{tra_\nabla(\gamma')}{\to}& P_z &&& P
    \\
    && && &&& \downarrow
    \\
    x &\stackrel{\gamma}{\to}& y &\stackrel{\gamma'}{\to}& z
    &&&
    X
  }    
  \,.
$$

In order to formalize this, we introduce a ([[diffeological space|diffeological]]) [[Lie groupoid]] to be called the [[path groupoid]] of $X$. (Constructions and results in this section are from ([SWI](#SWI)).

For $X$ a [[smooth manifold]] let $[I,X]$ be the set of [[smooth function]]s $I = [0,1] \to X$. For $U$ a [[Cartesian space]], we say that _a $U$-parameterized smooth family of points in $[I,X]$_ is a smooth map $U \times I \to X$. (This makes $[I,X]$ a [[diffeological space]]).

Say a path $\gamma \in [I,X]$ has _[[sitting instant]]s_ if it is constant in a neighbourhood of the boundary $\partial I$. Let $[I,P]_{si} \subset [I,P]$ be the subset of paths with sitting instants. 

Let $[I,X]_{si} \to [I,X]_{si}^{th}$ be the projection to the set of [[equivalence class]]es where two paths are regarded as equivalent if they are cobounded by a smooth [[thin homotopy]].

Say a $U$-parameterized smooth family of points in $[I,X]_{si}^{th}$ is one that comes from a $U$-family of representatives in $[I,X]_{si}$ under this projection. (This makes also $[I,X]_{si}^{th}$ a [[diffeological space]].)

+-- {: .un_remark}
###### Remark

The passage to the subset and quotient $[I,X]_{si}^{th}$ of the set of all smooth paths in the above definition is essentially the minimal adjustment to enforce that the concatenation of smooth paths at their endpoints defines the composition operation in a groupoid.

=--


+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Definition

The **path groupoid** $\mathbf{P}_1(X)$ is the groupoid

$$
  \mathbf{P}_1(X) = ([I,X]_{si}^{th} \stackrel{\to}{\to} X)
$$

with source and target maps given by endpoint evaluation and composition given by concatenation of classes $[\gamma]$ of paths along any orientation preserving [[diffeomorphism]] $[0,1] \to [0,2] \simeq [0,1] \coprod_{1,0} [0,1]$ of any of their representatives

$$
  [\gamma_2] \circ [\gamma_1] : [0,1]
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} [0,1] \coprod_{1,0} [0,1]
  \stackrel{(\gamma_2 , \gamma_1)}{\to}
  X
  \,.
$$

This becomes an [[internal groupoid]] in [[diffeological spaces]] with the above $U$-families of smooth paths. We regard it as a [[groupoid-valued presheaf]], an object in $[CartSp^{op}, Grpd]$:

$$
  \mathbf{P}_1(X) : U \mapsto (Diff(U \times I, X)_{si}^{th} \stackrel{\to}{\to} Diff(U,X) )
  \,.
$$

=--

Observe now that for $G$ a [[Lie group]] and $\mathbf{B}G$ its [[delooping]] [[Lie groupoid]] discussed [above](#PrincipalBundles), a smooth functor $tra : \mathbf{P}_1(X) \to \mathbf{B}G$ sends each (thin-homotopy class of a) path to an element of the group $G$ 

$$
  tra : (x \stackrel{[\gamma]}{\to} y)
  \mapsto
  (
  \bullet
  \stackrel{tra(\gamma) \in G}{\to}
  \bullet
  )
$$

such that composite paths map to products of group elements 

$$
  tra : 
  \left(
    \array{
      && y
      \\
      & {}^{\mathllap{[\gamma]}}\nearrow &=& \searrow^{\mathrlap{[\gamma']}}
      \\
      x &&\stackrel{[\gamma']\circ [\gamma]}{\to}&& z
    }
  \right)
  \mapsto
  \left(
    \array{
      && \bullet
      \\
      & {}^{\mathllap{tra(\gamma)}}\nearrow 
      &=& 
      \searrow^{\mathrlap{tra(\gamma')}}
      \\
      \bullet &&\stackrel{tra(\gamma)tra(\gamma')}{\to}&& \bullet
    }
  \right)
$$

and such that $U$-families of smooth paths induce smooth maps $U \to G$ of elements. 

There is a classical construction that yields such an assignment: the [[parallel transport]] of a [[Lie-algebra valued 1-form]].

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Definition

Suppose $A \in \Omega^1(X, \mathfrak{g})$ is a degree-1 [[differential form]] on $X$ with values in the [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ of $G$. Then its parallel transport is the smooth functor

$$
   tra_A : \mathbf{P}_1(X) \to \mathbf{B}G
$$

given by

$$
  [\gamma] \mapsto P \exp(\int_{[0,1]} \gamma^* A) \; \in G
  \,,
$$

where the group element on the right is defined to be the value at 1 of the unique solution $f :  [0,1] \to G$ of the [[differential equation]]

$$
  d_{dR} f + \gamma^*A \wedge f = 0
$$

for the boundary condition $f(0) = e$.

=--

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Theorem 

This construction $A \mapsto tra_A$ induces an [[equivalence of categories]]

$$
  [CartSp^{op},Grpd](\mathbf{P}_1(X), \mathbf{B}G)
  \simeq
  \mathbf{B}G_{conn}(X)
  \,,
$$

where on the left we have the [[hom-groupoid]] of [[groupoid-valued presheaves]] and  where on the right we have the [[groupoid of Lie-algebra valued 1-forms]] whose 

* objects are 1-forms $A \in \Omega^1(X,\mathfrak{g})$, 

* morphisms $g : A_1 \to A_2$ are labeled by [[smooth function]]s $g \in C^\infty(X,G)$ such that $A_2 = g^{-1} A g + g^{-1}d g$.

This equivalence is [[natural transformation|natural]] in $X$, so that we obtain another smooth groupoid.

###### Definition

Define $\mathbf{B}G_{conn} : CartSp^{op} \to Grpd$ to be the (generalized) Lie groupoid

$$

whose $U$-parameterized smooth families of groupoids form the [[groupoid of Lie-algebra valued 1-forms]] on $U$.

This equivalence in particular subsumes the classical facts that parallel transport $\gamma \mapsto P \exp(\int_{[0,1]} \gamma^* A)$ 

* is invariant under orientation preserving reparameterizations of paths;

* sends reversed paths to inverses of group elements.

+-- {: .un_lemma}
###### Observation

There is an evident natural smooth functor $X \to \mathbf{P}_1(X)$ that includes points in $X$ as constant paths. This induces a natural morphism $\mathbf{B}G_{conn} \to \mathbf{B}G$ that forgets the 1-forms.

###### Defintion

Let $P \to X$ be a $G$-[[principal bundle]] that corresponds to a cocycle $g : C(U) \to \mathbf{B}G$ under the construction discussed [above](#PrincipalBundles).  Then a **[[connection on a bundle|connection]]** $\nabla$ on $P$ is  a lift of the cocycle through $\mathbf{B}G_{conn} \to \mathbf{B}G$.

$$

+-- {: .un_lemma}
###### Observation

This is equivalent to any of the [[connection on a bundle|standard definitions]].

=--

A morphism $C(U) \to \mathbf{B}G_{conn}$ is

* on each $U_i$ a 1-form $A_i \in \Omega^1(U_i, \mathfrak{g})$;

* on each $U_i \cap U_j$ a function $g_{i j} \in C^\infty(U_i \cap U_j , G)$;

such that

* on each $U_i \cap U_j$ we have $A_j = g_{i j}^{-1}( A + d_{dR} )g_{i j}$;

* on each $U_i \cap U_j \cap U_k$ we have $g_{i j} \cdot g_{j k} = g_{i k}$.

###### Definition

Let $[I,X]_{si}^{th} \to [I,X]^h$ the projection onto the full quotient by smooth [[homotopy]] classes of paths.

Write $\mathbf{\Pi}_1(X) = ([I,X]^h \stackrel{\to}{\to} X)$ for the smooth groupoid defined as $\mathbf{P}_1(X)$, but where instead of thin homotopies, all homotopies are divided out.

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

The above restricts to a natural equivalence

$$
  [CartSp^{op}, Grpd](\mathbf{\Pi}_1(X), \mathbf{B}G)
  \simeq
  \mathbf{\flat}\mathbf{B}G
  \,,
$$

where on the left we have the [[hom-groupoid]] of groupoid-valued presheaves, and on the right we have the [[full subcategory|full sub-groupoid]] $\mathbf{\flat}\mathbf{B}G \subset \mathbf{B}G_{conn}$ on those $\mathfrak{g}$-valued differential forms whose [[curvature]] 2-form $F_A = d_{dR} A + [A \wedge A]$ vanishes.

A connection $\nabla$ is _flat_ precisely if it factors through the inclusion $\flat \mathbf{B}G \to \mathbf{B}G_{conn}$.

=--

For the purposes of [[Chern-Weil theory]] we want a good way to extract the [[curvature]] 2-form in a general abstract way from a cocycle $\nabla : X \stackrel{\simeq}{\leftarrow }C(U) \to \mathbf{B}G_{conn}$. In order to do that, we first need to discuss [[connections on 2-bundles]].


#### Connections on principal 2-bundles {#ConnectionOn2Bundle}

There is an evident higher dimensional generalization of the definition of connections on 1-bundles in terms of functors out of the [[path groupoid]] discussed [above](#ConnectionOnPrincipalBundle). This we discuss now. We will see that, however, the obvious generalization captures not quite all 2-connections. But we will also see a way to recode 1-connections in terms of flat 2-connections. And that recoding then is the right general abstract perspective on connections, which generalizes to [[principal ∞-bundles]] and in fact which in the [[schreiber:differential cohomology in an (∞,1)-topos|full theory]] follows from first principles.

(Constructions and results in this section are from ([SWII+III](#SW).)

+-- {: .un_def}
###### Definition

The [[path n-groupoid|path 2-groupoid]] $\mathbf{P}_2(X)$ is the smooth [[strict 2-groupoid]] analogous to $\mathbf{P}_1(X)$, but with nontrivial [[2-morphism]]s given by [[thin homotopy]]-classes of disks $\Delta^2_{Diff} \to X$ with [[sitting instant]]s.

In analogy to the projection $\mathbf{P}_1(X) \to \mathbf{\Pi}_1(X)$ there is a projection to $\mathbf{P}_2(X) \to \mathbf{\Pi}_2(X)$ to the 2-groupoid obtained by dividing out full homotopy of disks, relative boundary.

=--

+-- {: .un_lemma}
###### Observation

Let $G$ be a strict [[Lie 2-group]] coming from a [[crossed module]] $([G_2 \stackrel{\delta}{\to} G_1], \alpha : G_1 \to Aut(G_2))$.Its [[delooping]]  $\mathbf{B}G$ is the strict [[Lie 2-groupoid]] coming from the [[crossed complex]] $[G_2 \stackrel{\delta}{\to} G_1 \stackrel{\to}{\to} *]$.

$$
  \mathbf{B}G
  = 
  \left\{
    \array{
       && \bullet
       \\
       & {}^{\mathllap{g_1}}\nearrow 
       & \Downarrow^{\mathrlap{k}}& 
       \searrow^{\mathrlap{g_2}}
       \\
       \bullet &&\underset{\delta(k) g_1 g_2 }{\to}&&
       \bullet

    \;\;
    |
    \;\;
    g_1, g_2 \in G_1, k \in G_2 
  \right\}
  \,.
$$

This induces a [[differential crossed module]] $(\mathfrak{g}_2 \stackrel{\delta_*}{\to} \mathfrak{g}_1)$, the [[Lie 2-algebra]] of $G$.

=--

+-- {: .un_example}
###### Example

For $K$ an [[abelian group|abelian]] Lie group then $\mathbf{B}K$ is the [[delooping]] 2-group coming from the crossed module $[K \to 1]$ and $\mathbf{B}\mathbf{B}K$ is the 2-group coming from the complex $[K \to 1 \to 1]$.

=--

A smooth 2-functor  $\mathbf{\Pi}_2(X) \to \mathbf{B}G$ now assigns information also to surfaces

$$
  \left(
    \array{
      && y
      \\
      & {}^{\mathllap{\gamma_1}}\nearrow 
      &\Downarrow^{\mathrlap{\Sigma}}& 
      \searrow^{\mathrlap{\gamma_2}}

      \searrow^{\mathrlap{tra(\gamma_2)}}

and thus encodes a [[higher parallel transport]].

  the 2-form [[curvature]] 
 
  $$
    F_2(A,B) := d_{dR} A + [A \wedge A] + \delta_* B
  $$

  and the 3-form curvature

  vanish.

* morphisms $(\lambda,a) : (A,B) \to (A',B')$

  $\lambda \in C^\infty(X,G_1)$ such that
  $A' = \lambda A \lambda^{-1} + \lambda d \lambda^{-1} + \delta_* a$
  and $B' = \lambda(B) + d_{dR} a + [A\wedge a]$

* 2-morphisms are... (exercise).

As before, this is natural in $X$, so that we that we get a [[(infinity,1)-presheaf|presheaf of 2-groupoids]]

###### Proposition

If in the above definition we use $\mathbf{P}_2(X)$ instead of $\mathbf{\Pi}_2(X)$, we obtain the same 2-groupoid, except that the 3-form curvature $F_3(A,B)$ is not required to vanish.

###### Definition

Let $P \to X$ be a $G$-[[principal 2-bundle]] classified by a cocycle $C(U) \to \mathbf{B}G$. Then a structure of a _flat_ **[[connection on a 2-bundle]]** $\nabla $ on it is a lift

+-- {: .un_remark}
###### Remark

The attentive reader will wonder why we do not state the last definition for general Lie 2-groups $G$. The reason is that for general $G$ 2-anafunctors out of $\mathbf{P}_2(X)$ do not produce the fully general notion of 2-connections that we are after,  but yield a special case in between flatness and non-flatness: the case where precisely the 2-form [[curvature]]-components vanish, while the 3-form curvature part is unrestricted. This case is important in itself and discussed in detail [below](#below). 

Only for $G$ of the form $\mathbf{B}A$ does the 2-form curvature necessarily vanish anyway, so that in this case the  definition by morphisms out of $\mathbf{P}_2(X)$ happens to already coincide with the proper general one. This serves in the following theorem as an illustration for the toolset that we are exposing, but for the purposes of introducing the full notion of $\infty$-Chern-Weil theory we will rather focus on flat 2-connections, and then show in [Curvature characteristics of 1-bundles](#CurvatureCharacteristicsI) how using these one does arrive at a functorial definition of 1-connections that does generalize to the fully general definition of $\infty$-connections.

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Theorem

Let $\{U_i \to X\}$ be a [[good open cover]], a cocycle $C(U) \to [\mathbf{P}_2(-), \mathbf{B}^2 A]$ is a cocycle in [[Cech cohomology]]-[[Deligne cohomology]] in degree 3. 

Moreover, we have a natural equivalence of [[bicategories]]

$$
  [CartSp^{op}, 2Grpd](C(U), [\mathbf{P}_2(-), \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)])
  \simeq
  U(1) Gerb_\nabla(X)
  \,,
$$

where on the right we have the bicategory of $U(1)$-[[bundle gerbe]]s with connection.

In particular the equivalence classes of cocycles form, the degree 3 [[ordinary differential cohomology]] of $X$:

$$
  H^3_{diff}(X, \mathbb{Z}) \simeq \pi_0( [C(U), [\mathbf{P}_2(-), \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)]])
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .un_remark}
###### Remark

A cocycle as above naturally corresponds to a [[∞-anafunctor|2-anafunctor]]

    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    \\
    \mathbf{P}_2(X)
  }
  \,.
$$

The value of this on 2-morphisms in $\mathbf{P}_2(X)$ is the [[higher parallel transport]] of the connection on the 2-bundle. 

This appears for instance in the [[action functional]] of the [[sigma model]] that describes strings charged under a [[Kalb-Ramond field]].

###### Example

By the above theorem we have that there is a bijection of sets

$$
  \{\mathbf{\Pi}_2(X) \to \mathbf{B} INN(G)\}
  \simeq
  \Omega^1(X, \mathfrak{g})
$$

of flat $INN(G)$-valued 2-connections and Lie-algebra valued 1-forms. Under the identifications of this theorem this identification works as follows:

* the 1-form component of the 2-connection is $A$;

* the vanishing of the 2-form component of the 2-curvature $F_2(A,B) = F_A + B$  identifies the 2-form component of the 2-connection with the [[curvature]] 2-form, $B = - F_A$;

* the vanishing of the 3-form component of the 2-curvature $F_3(A,B) = d B + [A \wedge B] = d_A + [A \wedge F_A]$ is the [[Bianchi identity]] satisfied by any curvature 2-form.

=--

This means that 2-connections with values in $INN(G)$ actually model 1-connections _and_ keep track of their curvatures. Using this we see in the next section a general abstract definition of connections on 1-bundles that naturally supposrt the [[Chern-Weil homomorphism]].


#### Curvature characteristics of 1-bundles {#CurvatureCharacteristicsI}

We now describe connections on 1-bundles in terms of their _flat curvature 2-bundles_ . This gives a general abstract notion of connections that generalizes to [[connections on ∞-bundles]] and that supports naturally the [[Chern-Weil homomorphism]]

Throughout this section $G$ is a [[Lie group]], $\mathbf{B}G$ its [[delooping]] 2-groupoid and $INN(G)$ its [[inner automorphism 2-group]] and $\mathbf{B}INN(G)$ the corresponding delooping [[Lie 2-groupoid]].

###### Remark

By the above theorems, we have over any $U \in $ [[CartSp]] that

* an [[object]] in $\mathbf{B}G_{diff}(U)$ is a 1-form $A \in \Omega^1(U,\mathfrak{g})$;

* a [[morphism]] $A_1 \stackrel{(g,a)}{\to} A_2$ is labeled by a function $g \in C^\infty(U,G)$ and a 1-form $a \in \Omega^1(U,\mathfrak{g})$ such that

  $$
    A_2 = g^{-1}A_1 g + g^{-1}d g  + a
    \,.
  $$
  
  Notice that this can always be uniquely solved for $a$, so that the genuine information in this morphism is just the data given by $g$. 

* thet are _no_ nontrivial [[2-morphism]]s, even though $\mathbf{B}INN(G)$ is a 2-groupoid: since $\mathbf{B}G$ is just a 1-groupoid this is enforced by the commutativity of the above diagram.

Pseudo-connections in themselves are not very interesting. But notice that every ordinary connection is in particular a pseudo-connection and we have an inclusion  morphism of smooth groupoids

$$
  \mathbf{B}G_{conn} \hookrightarrow \mathbf{B}G_{diff}
  \,.
$$

This inclusion plays a central role in the theory. The crucial point is that while $\mathbf{B}G_{diff}$ is such a boring extenion of $\mathbf{B}G$ that it is actually equivalent to $\mathbf{B}G$, there is no inclusion of $\mathbf{B}G_{conn}$ into $\mathbf{B}G$, but there is into $\mathbf{B}G_{diff}$. This is the kind of situation that [[resolution]]s are needed for.


##### Of $U(1)$-principal bundles {#U1BundCurvatureCharacteristics}

Before further considering $\mathbf{B}G_{diff}$ for general $G$, it is useful to look at some details for the case that $G$ is an [[abelian group]] such as the [[circle group]] $U(1)$.

In this abelian case the 2-groupoids $\mathbf{B}U(1)$, $\mathbf{B}^2 U(1)$, $\mathbf{B}INN(U(1))$, etc., that so far we noticed are given by [[crossed complex]]es are actually given by ordinary [[chain complex]]es: we write 

$$
  \Xi : Ch_\bullet^+ \to sAb \to KanCplx
$$

for the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] map that identifies [[chain complex]]es with [[simplicial abelian group]] and then considers their underlying [[Kan complex]]es. Using this map we have the following identifications of our 2-groupoid valued presheaves with complexes of group-valued sheaves

$$
  \mathbf{B}U(1) = \Xi[C^\infty(-,U(1)) \to 0]
$$

$$
  \mathbf{B}^2 U(1) = \Xi[C^\infty(-,U(1))  \to 0 \to 0]
$$

$$
  \mathbf{B} INN U(1) = \Xi[C^\infty(-,U(1)) \stackrel{Id}{\to} C^\infty(-,U(1)) \to 0]
 \,.
$$

+-- {: .un_remark}
###### Observation

For $G = A$ an [[abelian group]], in particular the [[circle group]], there is a canonical morphism $\mathbf{B} INN(U(1)) \to \mathbf{B}\mathbf{B}U(1)$.

=--

On the level of chain complexes this is the evident chain map

$$
  \array{
    [C^\infty(-,U(1)) &\stackrel{Id}{\to}& C^\infty(-,U(1))
    &\to& 0]
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    [C^\infty(-,U(1)) &\to& 0 &\to& 0]    
  }
  \,.
$$

On the level of 2-groupoids this is the map that forgets the labels on the 1-morphisms

$$
  \left(
    \array{
      && \bullet
      \\
      & {}^{\mathllap{c_1}}\nearrow 
      & \Downarrow^{\mathrlap{k}}
      & \searrow^{\mathrlap{c_2}}
      \\
      \bullet
      &&\underset{c_3 = c_1 c_2 k}{\to}&&
      \bullet
    }
  \right)
  \;\;
  \mapsto
  \;\;
    \left(
    \array{
      && \bullet
      \\
      & {}^{\mathllap{Id}}\nearrow 
      & \Downarrow^{\mathrlap{k}}
      & \searrow^{\mathrlap{Id}}
      \\
      \bullet
      &&\underset{Id}{\to}&&
      \bullet
    }
  \right)
  \,.
$$

In terms of this map $INN(U(1))$ serves to interpolate between the single and the double delooping of $U(1)$. In fact the sequence of 2-functors

$$
  \mathbf{B}U(1) \to \mathbf{B}INN(U(1)) \to 
  \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)
$$

is a model for the $\mathbf{B}U(1)$-[[universal principal infinity-bundle|universal principal 2-bundle]]

$$
  \mathbf{B}U(1) \to  \mathbf{E} \mathbf{B}U(1)
  \to 
  \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)
  \,.
$$

This happens to be an [[exact sequence]] of [[2-groupoid]]s. Abstractly, what really matters is rather that it is a [[fiber sequence]], meaning that it is exact in the correct sense inside the [[(∞,1)-category]] [[∞LieGrpd]]. For our purposes it is however relevant that this particular model is exact in the ordinary sense in that we have a commuting diagram

$$
  \array{
    \mathbf{B}U(1) &\to& *
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbf{B}INN(U(1)) &\to& \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)
  }
$$

which is a [[pullback]] diagram, exhibitng $\mathbf{B}U(1)$ as the [[kernel]] of $\mathbf{B}INN(U(1)) \to \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)$.

We shall be interested in the [[pasting]] composite of this diagram with the one definition $\mathbf{B}G_{diff}$ over a domain $U$:

$$
  \array{
    U &\to&
    \mathbf{B}U(1) &\to& *
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbf{\Pi}(U) &\to& \mathbf{B}INN(U(1)) &\to& \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)
  }
  \,,
$$

The total outer diagram appearing this way is a component of the following (generalized) Lie 2-groupoid.

+-- {: .un_def}
###### Definition

Set

$$
  \mathbf{\flat}_{dR} \mathbf{B}^2U(1) = 
  * \times_{\mathbf{B}^2 U(1)} \mathbf{\flat} \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)
  \,.
$$


=--

Over any $U \in CartSp$ this is the 2-groupoid whose objects are sets of diagrams

$$
  \array{
    U &\to& *
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbf{\Pi}(U) &\to& \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)
  }
  \,.
$$

This are equivalently just morphisms $\mathbf{\Pi}_2(U) \to \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)$, which by the above theorems we may identify with closed 2-forms $B \in \Omega^2_{cl}(U)$.

The morphisms $B_1 \to B_2$ in $\mathbf{\flat}_{dR} \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)$ over $U$ are compatible [[pseudonatural transformation]]s of the horizontal morphisms, which means that they are pseudonatural transformations of the bottom morphism whose components over the points of $U$ vanish. These identify with 1-forms $\lambda \in \Omega^1(U)$ such that  $B_2 = B_1 + d_{dR} \lambda$.

Finally the 2-morphisms would be [[modification]]s of these, but the commutativity of the above diagram constrais these to be trivial.


In summary this shows that

$$

are canonically in bijection with the degree 2 [[de Rham cohomology]] of $X$.

=--

+-- {: .un_remar}
###### Remark


Notice that --  while every globally defined closed 2-form $B \in \Omega^2_{cl}(X)$ defines such a 2-anafunctor -- not every such 2-anafunctor comes from a globally defined closed 2-form. Some of them assign closed 2-forms $B_i$ to patches $U_1$, that differ by differentials $B_j - B_i = d_{dR} \lambda_{i j}$ of 1-forms $\lambda_{i j}$ on double overlaps, which themselves satisfy on triple intersections the cocycle condition $\lambda_{i j} + \lambda_{j k} = \lambda_{i k}$. But (using a [[partition of unity]], see there) these non-globally defined forms are always equivalent to globally defined ones.

This simple technical point turns out to play a crucial role in the abstract definition of [[connections on ∞-bundles]]: generally, for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the cocycles given by globally defined forms in $\mathbf{\flat}_{dR} \mathbf{B}^n U(1)$ constitute [[curvature characteristic form]]s of _genuine_ connections. The non-globally defined forms _also_ constitute curvature invariants, but of [[pseudo-connection]]s. The way the abstract theory finds the genuine connections inside all pseudo-connections is by the fact that we may find for each cocycle in $\mathbf{\flat}_{dR} \mathbf{B}^n U(1)$ an equivalent one that does comes from a globally defined form.

###### Observation

There is a canonical [[infinity-anafunctor|2-anafunctor]] $c_1^{dR} : \mathbf{B}U(1) \to \mathbf{\flat}_{dR}\mathbf{B}^2 U(1)$

$$
  \array{
    \mathbf{B}U(1)_{diff} &\to& \mathbf{\flat}_{dR} \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    \\
    \mathbf{B}U(1)
  }
  \,,
$$

where the top morphism is given by forming the [[pasting]]-composite with the $\mathbf{B} U(1)$-[[universal principal infinity-bundle|universal 2-bundle]], as described above.


=--

+-- {: .un_remark}
###### Remark


For emphasis, notice that this span is governed by a presheaf of diagrams that over $U \in CartSp$ is of the form

$$
  \array{
    U &\to& \mathbf{B}U(1) &&& transition\;function
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow 
    \\
    \mathbf{\Pi}(U) &\to& \mathbf{B}INN(U) &&& connection
    \\
    \downarrow &&  \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbf{\Pi}(U) &\to& \mathbf{B}^2 U(1) &&& curvature
  }
  \,.
$$

The top morphisms are the components of the presheaf $\mathbf{B}U(1)$. The top square are those of $\mathbf{B}U(1)_{diff}$. Forming the bottom square is forming the bottom morphism, which necessarily satifies the constraint that makes it a components of $\mathbf{\flat}\mathbf{B}^2 U(1)$. 

The interpretation of the stages is as indicated in the diagram:

1. the top morphism is the transition function of the underlying bundle;

1. the middle morphism is a choice of (pseudo-)connection on that bundle;

1. the bottom morphism picks up the curvature of this connection.

We will see that full $\infty$-Chern-Weil theory is governed by a slight refinement of presheaves of essentially this kind of diagram. We will also see that the three stage process here is really an incarnation of the computation of a [[connecting homomorphism]], reflecting the fact that behind the scenes the notion of _curvature_ is exhibited as the [[twisted cohomology|obstruction cocycle]] to lifts from bare bundles toflat bundles.

+-- {: .un_remark}
###### Observation

For $X \stackrel{\simeq}{\leftarrow} C(U) \stackrel{g}{\to} \mathbf{B}U(1)$ the cocycle for a $U(1)$-principal bundle as described above, the composition of [[infinity-anafunctor|2-anafunctor]]s of $g$ with $c_1^{dR}$ yields a cocycle for a 2-form $c_1^{dR}(g)$

$$
  \array{
    && \mathbf{B}U(1)_{conn}
    \\
    & {}^{\mathrlap{\nabla}}\nearrow & \downarrow
    \\

    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}} 
    \\
    X 
  }
  \,.
$$

If we take $\{U_i \to X\}$ to be a [[good open cover]], then we may assume $V = U$. We know we can always find a [[pseudo-connection]] $C(V) \to \mathbf{B}U(1)_{diff}$ that is actually a genuine [[connection on a bundle]] in that it factors through the inclusion $\mathbf{B}U(1)_{conn} \to \mathbf{B}U(1)_{diff}$ as indicated.

The corresponding total map $c_1^{dR}(g)$ represented by $c_1^{dR}(\nabla)$ is the cocycle for the [[curvature]] 2-form of this connection. This represents the first [[Chern class]] of the bundle in de Rham cohomology.

is equivalent to disjoint union of groupoids of $U(1)$-bundles with connection whose curvatures are the chosen 2-form representatives.

### Circle $n$-bundles with connection {#CirclenBundles}

For $A$ an [[abelian group]] there is a straightforward generalization of the above constructions to $(G = \mathbf{B}^{n-1}A)$-principal $n$-bundles with connection. We spell out the ingredients of the construction in a way analogous to the above discussion. A first-principles derivation of the objects we consider here is at [[circle n-bundle with connection]].

Specifically we consider the <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Lie+infinity-groupoid#BnU1">circle n-group</a> $G = \mathbf{B}^{n-1}U(1)$. We may make use of the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] for handling this:
 
this correspondence is an [[equivalence of categories]]

$$
  Ch_\bullet+ \stackrel{\overset{N}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Xi}{\to}} sAb
$$

that identifies abelian [[simplicial group]]s with non-negatively graded [[chain complex]]es. Since this is functorial, it also identifies chain complexes of (presheaves) of abelian groups with simplicial presheaves that take values in simplicial groups.

Using this, we can write $\mathbf{B}^n U(1) \in [CartSp^{op}, sSet]$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ simply as

$$
  \mathbf{B}^n U(1) := \Xi U(1)[n]
  \,,
$$

where in the argument of $\Xi$ we have the chain complex

$$
  U(1)[n] = 
  \left(
     C^\infty(-,U(1)) \to 0 \to \cdots \to 0
  \right)
$$

with the sheaf represented by $U(1)$ in degree $n$.

The $\infty$-bundle $P \to X$ classified by such a cocycle we may call a 
[[circle n-bundle]]. For $n = 1$ this reproduces the $U(1)$-[[principal bundle]]s that we considered before, for $n =2 $ the [[bundle gerbe]]s and for $n=3$ the [[bundle 2-gerbe]]s.

To equip these circle $n$-bundles with connections, we consider the differential refinements $\mathbf{B}^n U(1)_{diff}$, $\mathbf{B}^n U(1)_{conn}$ and $\mathbf{\flat}_{dR} \mathbf{B}^{n+1}U(1)$.

$$

etc. This is a cocycle in [[Cech cohomology|Cech]]-[[Deligne cohomology]]. We may think of this as encoding a [[circle n-bundle with connection]]. The forms $(C_i)$ are the local connection $n$-forms.

Connections on $G$-principal $\infty$-bundles for nonabelian $G$ do not have quite such a simple description. Therefore it makes sense to _approximate_ every $G$-cocylce $X \stackrel{\simeq}{\leftarrow} C(U) \to \mathbf{B}G$ by abelian cocycle by postcomposing with all possible [[characteristic class]]es $\mathbf{B}G \stackrel{\simeq}{\leftarrow} \hat \mathbf{B}G\to \mathbf{B}^n U(1)$ to extract a circle $n$-bundle from it. This is what we turn to now.


### $\infty$-Lie algebra valued connections {#LieConnections}

[Above](#LowDimension) we described ordinary [[connections on bundles]] as well as [[connections on 2-bundles]] in terms of [[parallel transport]] over paths and surfaces, and showed how such is equivalently given by cocycles with coefficients in [[Lie-algebra valued differential forms]] and [[Lie 2-algebra valued differential forms]], respectively. 

Notably we saw ([here](#CurvatureCharacteristicsI)) for the case of ordinary $U(1)$-[[principal bundle]]s, that the connection and curvature data on these is encoded in presheaves of diagrams that over a given test space $U \in $ [[CartSp]] look like

$$  
  \array{
    U &\to& \mathbf{B}U(1) &&& transition\;function
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow 
    \\
    \mathbf{\Pi}(U) &\to& \mathbf{B}INN(U) &&& connection
    \\
    \downarrow &&  \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbf{\Pi}(U) &\to& \mathbf{B}^2 U(1) &&& curvature
  }
$$

together with a constraint on the bottom morphism.

It is in the form of such a kind of diagram that the general notion of [[connections on ∞-bundles]] may be modeled. In the full theory of [[schreiber:differential cohomology in an (∞,1)-topos]] this follows from first principles, but for our present introductory purpose we shall be content with taking this simple situation of $U(1)$-bundles together with the notion of [[Lie integration]] as sufficient motivation for the constructions considered now. 

So we pass now to what is to some extent the reverse construction of the one considered before: we define a notion of [[∞-Lie algebra valued differential forms]] and show how by a variant of [[Lie integration]] these integrate to coefficient objects for [[connections on ∞-bundles]].


In the main entry [[∞-Chern-Weil theory]] we discuss how this dg-algebraic construction follows from a general abstract definitions of [[schreiber:differential cohomology in an (∞,1)-topos]].

The material of this section is due to ([SSS](#SSSI)) and ([FSS](#FSS)).


#### $\infty$-Lie algebroids

There is a precise sense in which one may think of a [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ as the [[infinitesimal space|infinitesimal]] sub-object of the delooping groupoid $\mathbf{B}G$ of the corresponding Lie group $G$. Without here going into the details of this relation (which needs a little bit of [[(∞,1)-topos]]-theory), we want to build certain [[∞-Lie groupoid]]s from the knowledge of their infinitesimal subobjects: these subobjects are [[∞-Lie algebroid]]s and specifically [[∞-Lie algebra]]s -- traditionally known as $L_\infty$-algebras. 

A quick but useful way of formalizing what this means is to observe that ordinary (finite-dimensional) [[Lie algebra]]s $(\mathfrak{g}, [-,-])$ are entirely encoded, dually, in their [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]]s $CE(\mathfrak{g}) = (\wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^*, d = [-,-]^*) $: free [[graded algebra|graded-commutative algebra]]s over the ground field $k$ on the vector space $\mathfrak{g}^*[1]$ equipped a differential $d$ of degree +1 and squaring to 0.

Simply by replacing in this characterization the vector space $\mathfrak{g}^*$ be an $\mathbb{N}$-[[graded vector space]], we arrive at the notion of [[∞-Lie algebra]]: the elements of $\mathfrak{g}[1]$ in degree $k$ are the infinitesimal [[k-morphism]]s.  Moreover, replacing in this characterization the ground field $k$ by an algebra of [[smooth function]]s on a manifold $\mathfrak{a}_0$, we obtain the notion of an [[∞-Lie algebroid]] $\mathfrak{g}$ over $\mathfrak{a}_0$. Morphisms $\mathfrak{a} \to \mathfrak{b}$ of such [[∞-Lie algebroid]]s are dually simply morphisms of [[dg-algebra]]s $CE(\mathfrak{a}) \leftarrow CE(\mathfrak{b})$.

The following definition glosses over some fine print but is entirely sufficient for our present discussion.

###### Definition

The category of [[∞-Lie algebroid]]s is the [[opposite category]] of the [[full subcategory]] of [[dgAlg]] 

$$
  \infty LieAlgbd \subset (dgAlg)^{op}
$$

on graded-commutative cochain [[dg-algebra]]s in non-negative degree whose underlying [[graded algebra]] is a [[Grassmann algebra]] over the degree-0 algbra.

+-- {: .un_example}
###### Examples

* A _strict_ $\infty$-Lie algebra is a [[dg-Lie algebra]] $(\mathfrak{g}, \partial, [-,-])$ with $(\mathfrak{g}^*, \partial^*)$ a [[cochain complex]] in non-negative degree. With $\mathfrak{g}^*$ denoting the degreewise dual, the corresponding CE-algebra is $CE(\mathfrak{g}) = (\wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^*, d_{CE} = [-,-]^* + \partial^*$. 

* We had already seen [above](#ConnectionOn2Bundle) the infinitesimal approximation of a [[Lie 2-group]]: this is a [[Lie 2-algebra]]. If the Lie 2-group is a smooth [[strict 2-group]] it is encoded equivalently by a [[crossed module]] of ordinary Lie groups, and the corresponding Lie 2-algebra is given by a [[differential crossed module]] of ordinary [[Lie algebra]]s.

* The [[tangent Lie algebroid]] $T X$ of a manifold $X$ is the infinitesimal approximation to its [[fundamental ∞-groupoid]]. Its CE-algebra is the [[de Rham complex]] 

  $CE(T X) = \Omega^\bullet(X)$.


* For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $n \geq 1$, the Lie $n$-algebra $b^{n-1}\mathbb{R}$ is the infinitesimal approximation to $\mathbf{B}^n U(\mathbb{R})$ and $\mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{R}$. Its CE-algebra is the dg-algebra on a single generators in degree $n$, with vanishing differential.

* For any $\infty$-Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ there is an $\infty$-Lie algebra $inn(\mathfrak{g})$ defined by the fact that its CE-algebra is the [[Weil algebra]] of $\mathfrak{g}$:

  $$
    CE(inn(\mathfrak{g})) = 
    W(\mathfrak{g}) = 
    (\wedge^\bullet (\mathfrak{g}^* \oplus \mathfrak{g}^*[1]), 
    d_{W}|_{\mathfrak{g}^*} = d_{CE} + \sigma )
    \,,
  $$

  where $\sigma : \mathfrak{g}^* \to \mathfrak{g}^*[1]$ is the grading shift isomorphism, extended as a [[derivation]].

#### Characteristic cocycles from Lie integration {#LieIntOfCocycles}

The construction we want to describe may be understood as a generalization
of the following proposition. This is classical, even if maybe not reflected in the standard textbook literature to the extent it deserves to be (see [[Lie integration]] for details and references).

+-- {: .un_def}
###### Definition

For $\mathfrak{g}$ a (finite-dimensional) [[Lie algebra]], let $\exp(\mathfrak{g}) \in [CartSp^{op}, sSet]$ be the [[simplicial presheaf]] given by the assignment

$$
  \exp(\mathfrak{g})  : U
  \mapsto Hom_{dgAlg}(CE(\mathfrak{g}), \Omega^\bullet(U \times \Delta^\bullet)_{vert})
  \,,
$$

in degree $k$ of [[dg-algebra]] [[homomorphism]]s from the [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] of $\mathfrak{g}$ to the dg-algebra of [[vertical differential forms]] with respect to the trivial [[bundle]] $U \times \Delta^k \to U$.

=--

+-- {: .un_remark}
###### Remark

Shortly we will be considering variations of such assignments that are best thought about when writing out the [[hom-set]]s on the right here as sets of arrows; as in

$$
  \exp(\mathfrak{g})
   :
   (U,[k])
    \mapsto
    \left\{ 
      \array{
        \Omega^\bullet_{vert}(U \times \Delta^k) 
        &\stackrel{A_{vert}}{\leftarrow}&
        CE(\mathfrak{g})
      }
    \right\}
   ) 
  \,.
$$

=--

For $\mathfrak{g}$ an ordinary [[Lie algebra]] it is an ancient (see <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Chern-Weil%20theory#History">Chern-Weil theory -- history</a>) but important and simple observation that dg-algebra morphisms  $\Omega^\bullet(\Delta^k) \leftarrow CE(\mathfrak{g})$ are in natural bijection with [[Lie-algebra valued 1-form]]s that are _flat_ in that their [[curvature]] 2-forms vanish: the 1-form itself determines precisely a morphism of the underlying [[graded algebra]]s, and the respect for the differentials is exactly the flatness condition. It is this elementary but important observation that [historically](#http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Chern-Weil+theory#History) led [[Eli Cartan]] to [[Cartan calculus]] and the algebraic formulation of [[Chern-Weil theory]].

One finds that it makes good sense to generally, for $\mathfrak{g}$ any [[∞-Lie algebra]] or even [[∞-Lie algebroid]], think of $Hom_{dgAlg}(CE(\mathfrak{g}), \Omega^\bullet(\Delta^k))$ as the set of [[∞-Lie algebroid valued differential forms]] whose curvature forms (generally a whole tower of them) vanishes.

+-- {: .un_proposition}
###### Proposition

Let $G$ be the [[simply-connected]] [[Lie group]] integrating $\mathfrak{g}$ according to [[Lie's three theorems]] and  $\mathbf{B}G \in [CartSp^{op}, Grpd]$ its [[delooping]] [[Lie groupoid]] regarded as a [[groupoid]]-valued [[presheaf]] on [[CartSp]]. Write $\tau_1(-)$ for the operation that quotients out 2-morphisms in a simplicial presheaf to obtain a presheaf of groupoids. 

We have an [[isomorphism]]

$$
  \mathbf{B}G  
  =
  \tau_1
  \exp(\mathfrak{g})
  \,.
$$

=--


To see this, observe that the presheaf $\exp(\mathfrak{g})$ has as 1-morphisms $U$-parameterized families of $\mathfrak{g}$-valued 1-forms $A_{vert}$ on the interval, and as 2-morphisms $U$-parameterized families of _flat_ 1-forms on the disk, interpolating between these. By identifying these 1-forms with the pullback of the [[Maurer-Cartan form]] on $G$, we may equivalently think of the 1-morphisms as based smooth paths in $G$ and 2-morphisms smooth [[homotopies]] relative endpoints between them. Since $G$ is [[simply-connected]] this means that after dividing out 2-morphisms only the endpoints of these paths remain, which identify with the points in $G$. 

We now describe [[characteristic class]]es and [[curvature characteristic form]]s on $G$-bundles in terms of these simplicial presheaves.
For that purpose it is useful for a moment to ignore the truncation issue -- to come back to it later -- and consider these simplicial presheaves untruncated. 

To see characteristic classes in this picture, write $CE(b^{n-1} \mathbb{R})$ for the commutative real [[dg-algebra]] on a single generator in degree $n$ with vanishing differential. As our notation suggests, this we may think as the [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] of a _higher Lie algebra_  -- the [[∞-Lie algebra]] $b^{n-1} \mathbb{R}$ -- which is an [[Eilenberg-MacLane object]] in the [[homotopy theory]] of [[∞-Lie algebra]]s, representing [[∞-Lie algebra cohomology]] in degree $n$ with coefficients in $\mathbb{R}$.

Restating this in elementary terms, this just says that [[dg-algebra]] [[homomorphism]]s

$$
  CE(\mathfrak{g}) \leftarrow CE(b^{n-1}\mathbb{R}) : \mu
$$

are in natural bijection with elements $\mu \in CE(\mathfrak{g})$ of degree $n$, that are closed, $d_{CE(\mathfrak{g})} \mu = 0$. This is the classical description of a cocycle in the [[Lie algebra cohomology]] of $\mathfrak{g}$.

+-- {: .un_def}
###### Definition

Every such $\infty$-Lie algebra cocycle $\mu$ induces a morphism of simplicial presheaves

$$
  \exp(\mu) : \exp(\mathfrak{g}) \to \exp(b^n \mathbb{R})
$$
  
given by postcomposition

$$
  \Omega^\bullet_{vert}(U \times \Delta^l)
  \stackrel{A_{vert}}{\leftarrow}
  CE(\mathfrak{g})
  \stackrel{\mu}{\leftarrow}
  CE(b^n \mathbb{R})
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .un_example}
###### Example
**(first Pontryagin class)**

Assume $\mathfrak{g}$ to be a [[semisimple Lie algebra]], let $\langle -,-\rangle$ be the [[Killing form]] and $\mu = \langle -,[-,-]\rangle$ the corresponding 3-cocycle in [[Lie algebra cohomology]]. We may assume without restriction that this cocycle is normalized such that its left-invariant continuation to a 3-form on $G$ has integral [[period]]s. Observe that since $\pi_2(G)$ is trivial we have that the 3-[[coskeleton]] of $\exp(\mathfrak{g})$ is equivalent to $\mathbf{B}G$. By the inegrality of $\mu$, the operation of $\exp(\mu)$ on $\exp(\mathfrak{g})$ followed by integration over simplices descends to an [[∞-anafunctor]] from $\mathbf{B}G$ to $\mathbf{B}^3 U(1)$, as indicated on the right of this diagram in $[CartSp^{op}, sSet]$

$$
  \array{
     && \exp(\mathfrak{g}) &\stackrel{\exp(\mu)}{\to}&
     \exp(b^{n-1}\mathbb{R})
     \\
      && \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\int_{\Delta^\bullet}}}
     \\
     C(V) & \stackrel{\hat g}{\to}& \mathbf{cosk}_3 \exp(\mathfrak{g})
     &\stackrel{\int_{\Delta^\bullet}\mathbf{cosk}_3 \exp(\mu)}{\to}&
     \mathbf{B}^3 \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}
     \\
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}&& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
     \\
     C(U) &\stackrel{g}{\to}& \mathbf{B}G
     \\
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
     \\
     X
  }
  \,.
$$

Precomposing this -- as indicated on the left of the diagram -- with another $\infty$-anafunctor $X \stackrel{\simeq}{\leftarrow}C(U)\stackrel{g}{\to} \mathbf{B}G$ for a $G$-principal bundle , hence a collection of transition functions $\{g_{i j} : U_i \cap U_j \to G\}$ amounts to choosing (possibly on a refinement $V$ of the cover $U$ of $X$)

* on each $V_i \cap V_j$ a lift $\hat g_{i j}$ of $g_{i j}$ to a familly of smooth based paths in $G$  -- $\hat g_{i j} : (V_i \cap V_j) \times \Delta^1 \to G$ -- with endpoints $g_{i j}$;

* on each $V_i \cap V_j \cap V_k$ a smooth family  $\hat g_{i j k} : (V_i \cap V_j \cap V_k) \times \Delta^2 \to G$ of disks interpolating between these paths;

* on each $V_i \cap V_j \cap V_k \cap V_l$ a a smooth family  $\hat g_{i j k l} : (V_i \cap V_j \cap V_k \cap V_l) \times \Delta^3 \to G$ of 3-balls interpolating between these disks.

On this datat the morphism $\int_{\Delta^\bullet} \exp(\mu)$ acts by sending each 3-cell to the number

$$
  \hat g_{i j k l} \mapsto \int_{\Delta^3} \hat g_{i j k l}^* \mu
  \;\;  mod \mathbb{Z}
  \,,
$$

where $\mu$ is regarded in this formula as a closed 3-form on $G$.

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

The [[Cech cohomology]] cocycle obtained this way is the first [[Pontryagin class]] of the $G$-bundle classified by $G$.

=--

This follows by observing that the composition of [[∞-anafunctor]]s as spelled out in components above is verbatim the construction of Cech cocycles for the first Pontryagin class as given in ([BryMac](#BrylinskiMacLaughlin)). We may think of this as the classifying map for the [[Chern-Simons circle 3-bundle]] corresponding to the $G$-bundle classified by $g$.

These authors prove that this is indeed the claimed class by refining this $U(1)$-cocycle to [[Deligne cohomology]] and computing its [[curvature]] 4-form. As we proceed now, we will see that this refinement, too, is obtained as a composition of $\infty$-anafunctors for cocycles of bundles with connection. 

#### Curvature characteristics and Chern-Simons forms {#CurvCharAndCS}

For $G$ a Lie group, we have described [above](#ConnectionOnPrincipalBundle) connections on $G$-principal bundles in terms of cocycles with coefficients in the Lie-[[groupoid of Lie-algebra valued forms]] $\mathbf{B}G_{conn}$

$$
  \array{
  && \mathbf{B}G_{conn} &&& connection
  \\
  & {}^{\mathllap{\nabla}}\nearrow & \downarrow
  \\
  && \mathbf{B}G_{diff} &&& pseudo-connection
  \\
  & {}^{\mathllap{\nabla_{ps}}}\nearrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}} 
  \\
  C(U) &\stackrel{g}{\to}& \mathbf{B}G &&& transition\;function
  }
  \,.
$$

In this context we had _derived_ Lie algebra valued forms from the [[parallel transport]] description $\mathbf{B}G_{conn} = [\mathbf{P}_1(-), \mathbf{B}G]$. We now turn this around and use [[Lie integration]] to construct parallel transport from Lie-algebra valued forms. The construction is such that it generalizes verbatim to [[∞-Lie algebra valued forms]].

For that purpose notice that another classical dg-algebra associated with $\mathfrak{g}$ is its [[Weil algebra]] $W(\mathfrak{g})$. 

+-- {: .un_lemma}
###### Fact

The [[Weil algebra]] $W(\mathfrak{g})$ is characterized by the fact that dg-algebra homomorphisms $W(\mathfrak{g}) \to \Omega^\bullet(X)$ are in natural bijection with arbitrary, not-necessarily flat, $\mathfrak{g}$-valued forms. In other words, $W(\mathfrak{g})$ is -- up to [[isomorphism]] -- [[generalized the|the]] [[free functor|free]] [[dg-algebra]] on the [[graded vector space]] $\mathfrak{g}$:

$$
  Hom_{dgAlg}(W(V^*), A) \simeq Hom_{Vect_\mathbb{Z}}(V^*, A)
  \,.
$$

=--

(Notice that the other dg-algebras that we are dealing with are [[semi-free dga]]s in that only their underlying [[graded algebra]] is free, but not the differential). 

The most obvious realization of the free dg-algebra on $\mathfrak{g}^*$ is $\wedge^\bullet (\mathfrak{g}^* \oplus \mathfrak{g}^*[1])$ equipped with the differential that is precisely the degree shift isomorphism $\sigma : \mathfrak{g}^* \to \mathfrak{g}^*[1]$ extended as a [[derivation]]. This is not the Weil algebra on the nose, but is isomorphic to it. The differential of the Weil algebra on $\wedge^\bullet (\mathfrak{g}^* \oplus \mathfrak{g}^*[1])$ is given on the unshifted generators by the sum of the CE-differential with the shift isomorphism

$$
  d_{W(\mathfrak{g})}|_{\mathfrak{g}^*} = d_{CE(\mathfrak{g})} + \sigma
  \,.
$$

This uniquely fixes the differential on the shifted generators -- a phenomenon known (at least after mapping this to differential forms, as we discuss below) as the [[Bianchi identity]].

The special property of this incarnation of the free dg-algebra on $\mathfrak{g}^*$ is that it makes the canonical dg-algebra homomorphism  

$$
  CE(\mathfrak{g}) \leftarrow W(\mathfrak{g}) : i^*
$$

manifest as the map that is the identity on the unshifted generators and zero on the shifted generators. 

Using this, we can express also the presheaf $\mathbf{B}G_{diff}$ from above in the fashion of $\exp(\mathfrak{g})$.


+-- {: .un_lemma}
###### Observation

The presheaf $\mathbf{B}G_{diff} \in [CartSp^{op}, Grpd]$ is isomorphic to

$$
  \mathbf{B}G_{diff}  =
  \tau_1
  \exp(\mathfrak{g})_{diff}
   :
   (U,[k]) \mapsto 
    \left\{ 
      \array{
        \Omega^\bullet_{vert}(U \times \Delta^k) 
        &\stackrel{A_{vert}}{\leftarrow}&
        CE(\mathfrak{g})
        \\
        \uparrow && \uparrow
        \\
        \Omega^\bullet(U \times \Delta^k)
        &\stackrel{A}{\leftarrow}&
        W(\mathfrak{g})
      }
    \right\} 
  \,
$$

where on the right we have the 1-truncation of the simplicial presheaf of diagrams as indicated, where the vertical morphisms are the canonical ones.

=--

Here over a given $U$ the bottom morphism in such a diagram is an arbitrary $\mathfrak{g}$-valued 1-form $A$ on $U \times \Delta^k$. This we can decompose as $A = A_U + A_{vert}$, where $A_U$ vanishes on tangents to $\Delta^k$ and $A_{vert}$ on tangents to $U$. The commutativity of the diagram asserts that $A_{vert}$ has to be such that the  curvature 2-form $F_{A_{vert}}$ vanishes when both its arguments are tangent to $\Delta^k$.

On the other hand, there is in the above no further constraint on $A_U$. Accordingly, as we pass to the 1-truncation of $\exp(\mathfrak{g})_{diff}$ we find that morphisms are of the form $(A_U)_1 \stackrel{g}{\to} (A_U)_2$ with $(A_U)^i$ arbitrary. This is the definition of $\mathbf{B}G_{diff}$.


+-- {: .un_remark}
###### Remark

We see below that it is not a coincidence that this is reminiscent to the first condition on an [[Ehresmann connection]] on a $G$-principal bundle, which asserts that restricted to the fibers a connection 1-form on the total space of the bundle has to be flat. Indeed, the presheaf $\mathbf{B}G_{diff}$ may be thought of as the $(\infty,1)$-sheaf of pseudo-connections on _trivial_ $\infty$-bundles. Imposing on this also the second Ehresmann condition will force the pseudo-connection to be a genuine connection.

=--


We now want to lift the [above](#LieIntOfCocycles) construction $\exp(\mu)$ of [[characteristic class]]es by <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Lie+infinity-groupoid#IntegrationOfCocycles">Lie integration of Lie algebra cocycles</a> $\mu$ from plain bundles classified by $\mathbf{B}G$ to bundles with (pseudo-)connection classified by $\mathbf{B}G_{diff}$. By what we just said we therefore need to extend $\exp(\mu)$ from a map on just $\exp(\mathfrak{g})$ to a map on $\exp(\mathfrak{g})_{diff}$.

This is evidently achieved by completing a square in [[dgAlg]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    CE(\mathfrak{g}) &\stackrel{\mu}{\leftarrow}& CE(b^{n-1} \mathbb{R})
    \\
    \uparrow && \uparrow
    \\
    W(\mathfrak{g}) &\stackrel{cs}{\leftarrow}& W(b^{n-1} \mathbb{R})
  }
$$

and defining $\exp(\mu)_{diff} : \exp(\mathfrak{g})_{diff} \to \exp(b^{n-1}\mathbb{R})_{diff}$ to be the operation of forming [[pasting]] composites with this.

Here $W(b^{n-1}\mathbb{R})$ is the Weil algebra of the 
[[infinity-Lie-algebra|Lie n-algebra]] $b^{n-1} \mathbb{R}$. This is the dg-algebra on two generators $c$ and $k$, respectively, in degree $n$ and $(n+1)$ with the differential given by $d_{W(b^{n-1} \mathbb{R})} : c \mapsto k$.

The commutativity of this diagram says that the bottom morphism takes the degree $n$-generator $c$ to an element $cs \in W(\mathfrak{g})$ whose restriction to the unshifted generators is the given cocycle $\mu$. 


As we shall see below, any such choice $cs$ will extend the characteristic cocycle obtained from $\exp(\mu)$ to a characteristic differential cocycle, exhibiting the $\infty$-Chern-Weil homomorphism. But only for special nice choices of $cs$ will this take genuine $\infty$-connections to genuine $\infty$-connections -- instead of to [[pseudo-connection]]s. As we discuss in the full [[∞-Chern-Weil theory]], this makes no difference in cohomology. But in practice it is useful to fine-tune the construction such as to produce nice models of the $\infty$-Chern-Weil homomorphism given by genuine $\infty$-connections. 

This is achieved by imposing the following additional constraint on the choice of extension $cs$ of $\mu$: 

+-- {: .un_def}
###### Definition

For $\mu \in CE(\mathfrak{g})$ a cocycle and $cs \in W(\mathfrak{g})$ a lift of $\mu$ through $W(\mathfrak{g}) \leftarrow CE(\mathfrak{g})$, we say that $d_{W(\mathfrak{g})}$ is an [[invariant polynomial]] _in transgression_ with $\mu$ if $d_{W(\mathfrak{g})}$ sits entirely in the shifted generators, in that $d_{W(\mathfrak{g})} \in \wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^*[1] \hookrightarrow W(\mathfrak{g})$.

=--

+-- {: .un_lemma}
###### Observation

For $\mathfrak{g}$ a [[Lie algebra]], this definition of invariant polynomials is equivalent to more traditional ones.

=--

To see this explicitly, let $\{t^a\}$ be a basis of $\mathfrak{g}^*$ and $\{r^a\}$ the corresponding basis of $\mathfrak{g}^*[1]$. Write $\{C^a{}_{b c}\}$ for the structure constants of the Lie bracket in this basis. 

Then for $P = P_{(a_1 , \cdots , a_k)} r^{a_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge r^{a_k} \in \wedge^{r} \mathfrak{g}^*[1]$ an element in the shifted generators, the condition that it is $d_{W(\mathfrak{g})}$-closed is equivalent to

$$
  C^{b}_{c (a_1} P_{b, \cdots, a_k)} t^c \wedge r^{a_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge r^{a_k}
  \,,
$$

where the parentheses around indices denotes symmetrization, as usual, so that this is equivalent to

$$
  \sum_{i} C^{b}_{c (a_i} P_{a_1 \cdots a_{i-1} b a_{i+1} \cdots, a_k)}
  = 0
$$ 


for all choice of indices. This is the component-version of the familiar invariance statement 

$$
  \sum_i P(t_1, \cdots, t_{i-1}, [t_c, t_i], t_{i+1}, \cdots , t_k)

* For $\mathfrak{g}$ a [[semisimple Lie algebra]], $\langle -,-\rangle$ the [[Killing form]] invariant polynomial, there is a Chern-Simons element $cs \in W(\mathfrak{g})$ witnessing the transgression to the cocycle $\mu = - \frac{1}{6} \langle -,[-,-] \rangle$. Under a $\mathfrak{g}$-valued form $\Omega^\bullet(X) \leftarrow W(\mathfrak{g}) : A$ this maps to the ordinary degree 3 [[Chern-Simons form]]

#### $\infty$-Connections from Lie integration {#LieIntConn}

We have seen above for $\mathfrak{g}$ an $\infty$-Lie algebroid the object
$\exp(\mathfrak{g})_{diff}$ that classifies [[pseudo-connection]]s
on $\exp(\mathfrak{g})$-principal $\infty$-bundles and serves to support the $\infty$-Chern-Weil homomorphism. We now discuss the genuine $\infty$-connections among these pseudo-connections. From the point of view of the general abstract theory these are particularly nice representatives of more intrinsically defined structures. 

For $X$ a [[smooth manifold]] and $\mathfrak{g}$ an [[∞-Lie algebra]] or more generally an [[∞-Lie algebroid]], a  **$\infty$-Lie algebroid valued differential form** on $X$ is a morphism of [[dg-algebra]]s

$$
  \Omega^\bullet(X)
  \leftarrow
  W(\mathfrak{g})
  : 
  A
$$

from the [[Weil algebra]] of $\mathfrak{g}$ to the [[de Rham complex]] of $X$. Dually this is a morphism of [[∞-Lie algebroid]]s

$$
  A : T X \to inn(\mathfrak{g})
$$

from the [[tangent Lie algebroid]] to the [[Weil algebra|inner automorphism ∞-Lie algebra]].

Its [[curvature]] is the composite of morphisms of [[graded vector space]]s

$$
  \Omega^\bullet(X) \stackrel{A}{\leftarrow}
  W(\mathfrak{g})
  \stackrel{F_{(-)}}{\leftarrow}
  \wedge^1 \mathfrak{g}^*
  : 
  F_{A}
  \,.
$$

Precisely if the curvatures vanish does the morphism factor through the [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] $W(\mathfrak{g}) \to CE(\mathfrak{g})$.

$$
  (F_A = 0) 
  \;\;\Leftrightarrow
  \;\;
  \left(
  \array{
     && CE(\mathfrak{g})
     \\
     & {}^{\mathllap{\exists A_{flat}}}\swarrow & \uparrow
     \\
     \Omega^\bullet(X) &\stackrel{A}{\leftarrow}& W(\mathfrak{g})     
  }
  \right)
$$

in which case we call $A$ **flat**.

The [[curvature characteristic form]]s of $A$ are the composite

$$
  \Omega^\bullet(X)
  \stackrel{A}{\leftarrow}
  W(\mathfrak{g})
  \stackrel{\langle F_{(-)} \rangle}{\leftarrow}
  inv(\mathfrak{g})
  :
  \langle F_A\rangle
  \,,
$$

where $inv(\mathfrak{g}) \to W(\mathfrak{g})$ is the inclusion of the [[invariant polynomial]]s.

       \forall v \in \Gamma(T \Delta^k) : \iota_v F_A = 0
  \right\}
$$


whose [[k-morphism]]s are $\mathfrak{g}$-valued forms $A$ on $U \times \Delta^k$ with sitting instants, and with the property that their [[curvature]] vanishes on vertical vectors.

The canonical morphism

$$
  \exp(\mathfrak{g})_{conn} \to \exp(\mathfrak{g})
$$

to the untruncated [[Lie integration]] of $\mathfrak{g}$ is given by restriction of $A$ to [[vertical differential form]]s (see below).

##### Curvature characteristics

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

For $A \in \exp(\mathfrak{g})_{conn}(U,[k])$ a $\mathfrak{g}$-valued form on $U \times \Delta^k$ and for $\langle - \rangle \in W(\mathfrak{g})$ any [[invariant polynomial]], the corresponding [[curvature characteristic form]] $\langle F_A \rangle \in \Omega^\bullet(U \times \Delta^k)$ descends down to $U$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

It is sufficient to show that for all $v \in \Gamma(T \Delta^k)$ we have

1. $\iota_v \langle F_A \rangle = 0$;

1. $\mathcal{L}_v \langle F_A \rangle = 0$.

The first condition is evidently satisfied if already $\iota_v F_A = 0$. The second condition follows with [[Cartan calculus]] and using that $d_{dR} \langle F_A\rangle = 0$:

$$
  \mathcal{L}_v \langle F_A \rangle = 
  d \iota_v \langle F_A \rangle
  + 
  \iota_v d \langle F_A \rangle
  = 0
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .un_lemma}
###### Remark

For a general $\infty$-Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ the curvature forms $F_A$ themselves are not closed, hence requiring them to have no component along the simplex does not imply that they descend. This is different for abelian $\infty$-Lie algebras: for them the curvature forms themselves are already closed, and hence are themselves already curvature characteristics that do descent.

=--


It is useful to organize the $\mathfrak{g}$-valued form $A$, together with its restriction $A_{vert}$ to [[vertical differential form]]s and with its [[curvature characteristic form]]s in the [[commuting diagram]]

$$

      \Omega^\bullet(U \times \Delta^k)_{vert}

If we just consider the top horizontal morphism in this diagram we obtain the object

    \array{
      \Omega^\bullet(U \times \Delta^k)_{vert}
      &\stackrel{A_{vert}}{\leftarrow}&
      CE(\mathfrak{g})
     }

$$

discussed in detail at [[Lie integration]]. If we consider the top square of the diagram we obtain the object

$$
  \exp(\mathfrak{g})_{diff}(U)
  :
  [k]
  \mapsto
  \left\{
    \array{

      &\stackrel{A}{\leftarrow}&
      W(\mathfrak{g})
   }
  \right\}
  \,.
$$

This forms a [[resolution]] of $\exp(\mathfrak{g})$ and may be thought of as the $\infty$-groupoid of [[pseudo-connection]]s.


We have an evident sequence of morphisms

$$
  \array{
    \exp(\mathfrak{g})_{conn} &&& genuine\;connections
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    \exp(\mathfrak{g})_{CW} &&& pseudo-connection\;with\;global\;curvature\;characteristics 
    \\

    \\
    \exp(\mathfrak{g})_{diff} &&& pseudo-connections
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    \\
    \exp(\mathfrak{g}) &&& bare bundles
  }
  \,,
$$

where we label the objects by the structures they classify, as discussed at [[∞-Chern-Weil theory]].


Here the botton morphism is a weak equivalence and the others are [[monomorphism]]s. 

Notice that in full [[∞-Chern-Weil theory]] the fundamental object of interest is really $\exp(\mathfrak{g})_{diff}$ -- the object of [[pseudo-connection]]s. The other objects only serve the purpose of picking particularly nice representatives: 

the object $\exp(\mathfrak{g})_{CW}$ may contain pseudo-connections, those for which at least the associated [[circle n-bundles with connection]] given by the $\infty$-Chern Weil homomorphism are genuine connections.

This distinction is important: over objects $X \in $ [[∞LieGrpd]] that are not [[smooth manifold]]s but for instance [[orbifold]]s, the genuine connections for higher Lie algebras do _not_ exhaust all nonabelian differential cocycles. This just means that not every differential class in this case does have a nice representative in the usual sense.

##### 1-Morphisms: integration of infinitesimal gauge transformations {#InfGaugeTrafo}

The 1-[[morphism]]s in $\exp(\mathfrak{g})(U)$ may be thought of as [[gauge transformation]]s between $\mathfrak{g}$-valued forms. We unwind what these look like concretely.


+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

Given a 1-morphism in $\exp(\mathfrak{g})(X)$, represented by $\mathfrak{g}$-valued forms

$$
  \Omega^\bullet(U \times \Delta^1) 
  \leftarrow
  W(\mathfrak{g})
  : 
  A
$$

consider the unique decomposition

$$
  A = A_U + ( A_{vert} := \lambda \wedge d t)  \; \; 
  \,,
$$

with $A_U$ the horizonal differential form component and $t : \Delta^1 = [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}$ the canonical coordinate.

We call $\lambda$ the **gauge parameter** . This is a function on $\Delta^1$ with values in 0-forms on $U$ for $\mathfrak{g}$ an ordinary [[Lie algebra]], plus 1-forms on $U$ for $\mathfrak{g}$ a [[Lie 2-algebra]], plus 2-forms for a Lie 3-algebra, and so forth.

=--

We describe now how this enccodes a gauge transformation

$$
  A_0(s=0) \stackrel{\lambda}{\to} A_U(s = 1)
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .un_lemma}
###### Observation


By the nature of the [[Weil algebra]] we have

$$
  \frac{d}{d s} A_U
  =
  d_U \lambda + [\lambda \wedge A] + [\lambda \wedge A \wedge A] + \cdots
  + 
  \iota_s F_A
  \,,
$$

where the sum is over all higher brackets of the [[∞-Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$.

=--

In [[Cartan calculus]] for $\mathfrak{g}$ an ordinary one writes the corresponding  **[[Ehresmann connection|second Ehremsnn condition]]** $\iota_{\partial_s} F_A = 0$ equivalently

$$
  \mathcal{L}_{\partial_s} A = ad_\lambda A
  \,.
$$


+-- {: .un_def}
###### Definition

Define the **[[covariant derivative]] of the gauge parameter** to be

$$
  \nabla \lambda := d \lambda + [A \wedge \lambda] + [A \wedge A \wedge \lambda] + \cdots
  \,.
$$

=--

In this notation we have

* the general identity 

  \[
    \frac{d}{d s} A_U = \nabla \lambda + (F_A)_s
    \label{ShiftedGaugeTrafo}
  \]

* the **horizontality** or **[[rheonomy]]** constraint or **[[Ehresmann connection|second Ehresmann condition]]** $\iota_{\partial_s} F_A = 0$, the [[differential equation]]

  \[
    \frac{d}{d s} A_U = \nabla \lambda
    \label{GaugeTrafo}
    \,.
  \]

This is known as the equation for **infinitesimal [[gauge transformation]]s** of an $\infty$-Lie algebra valued form. 



+-- {: .un_lemma}
###### Observation

By [[Lie integration]] we have that $A_{vert}$ -- and hence $\lambda$ -- defines an element $\exp(\lambda)$ in the [[∞-Lie group]] that integrates $\mathfrak{g}$. 

The unique solution $A_U(s = 1)$ of the above [[differential equation]] at $s = 1$ for the initial values $A_U(s = 0)$ we may think of as the result of acting on $A_U(0)$ with the gauge transformatin $\exp(\lambda)$. 

=--



##### Examples


+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition
**(connections on ordinary bundles)**

For $\mathfrak{g}$ an ordinary [[Lie algebra]] with simply connected [[Lie group]] $G$ and for $\mathbf{B}G_{conn}$ the [[groupoid of Lie algebra-valued forms]] we have an [[isomorphism]]

$$
  \tau_1 \exp(\mathfrak{g})_{conn} = \mathbf{B}G_{conn}
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

To see this, first note that the sheaves of objects on both sides are manifestly isomorphic, both are the sheaf of $\Omega^1(-,\mathfrak{g})$. For morphisms, observe that for a form $\Omega^\bullet(U \times \Delta^1) \leftarow W(\mathfrak{g}) : A$ which we may decompose into a horizontal and a verical pice as $A = A_U + \lambda \wedge d t$ the condition $\iota_{\partial_t} F_A = 0$ is equivalent to the [[differential equation]]

$$
  \frac{\partial}{\partial t} A
  =
  d_U \lambda + [\lambda, A]
  \,.
$$

For any initial value $A(0)$ this has the unique solution

$$
  A(t) = g(t)^{-1} (A + d_{U}) g(t)
  \,,
$$

where $g : [0,1] \to G$ is the [[parallel transport]] of $\lambda$:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    &
    \frac{\partial}{\partial t}
    \left(
       g_(t)^{-1} (A + d_{U}) g(t)
     \right)
     \\
     = &
     g(t)^{-1} (A + d_{U}) \lambda g(t)
     -
     g(t)^{-1} \lambda (A + d_{U}) g(t)    
   \end{aligned}
$$

(where for ease of notaton we write actions as if $G$ were a [[matrix Lie group]]).

In particular this implies that the endpoints of the path of $\mathfrak{g}$-valued 1-forms are related by the usual cocycle condition in $\mathbf{B}G_{conn}$

$$
  A(1) = g(1)^{-1} (A + d_U) g(1)
  \,.
$$

In the same fashion one sees that given 2-cell in $\exp(\mathfrak{g})(U)$ and any 1-form on $U$ at one vertex, there is a unique lift to a 2-cell in $\exp(\mathfrak{g})_{conn}$, obtained by parallel transporting the form around. The claim then follows from the previous statement of [[Lie integration]] that $\tau_1 \exp(\mathfrak{g}) = \mathbf{B}G$.

=--


* For $\mathfrak{g}$ [[Lie 2-algebra]], a $\mathfrak{g}$-valued differential form in the sense described here is precisely an [[Lie 2-algebra valued form]].


* For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, a $b^{n-1}\mathbb{R}$-valued differential form is the same as an ordinary differential $n$-form.


* What is called an  "extended soft group manifold" in the literature on the [[D'Auria-Fre formulation of supergravity]] is really precisely a collection of $\infty$-Lie algebroid valued forms with values in a super $\infty$-Lie algebra such as the [[supergravity Lie 3-algebra]] (for 11-dimensional [[supergravity]]). The way [[curvature]] and [[Bianchi identity]] are read off from "extded soft group manifolds" in this literature is -- apart from this difference in terminology -- precisely what is described above. 


#### The $\infty$-Chern-Weil homomorphism

In the full [[∞-Chern-Weil theory]] the $\infty$-Chern-Weil homomorphism is conceptually very simple: for every $n$ there is canonically a morphism of [[∞-Lie groupoid]]s $\mathbf{B}^n U(1) \to \mathbf{\flat}_{dR}\mathbf{B}^{n+1}U(1)$ where the object on the right classifies ordinary [[de Rham cohomology]] in degree $n+1$. For $G$ any [[∞-group]] and any [[characteristic class]] $c : \mathbf{B}G \to \mathbf{B}^{n+1}U(1)$, the $\infty$-Chern-Weil homomorphism is the operation that takes a $G$-[[principal ∞-bundle]] $X \to \mathbf{B}G$ to the composite $X \to \mathbf{B}G \to \mathbf{B}^n U(1) \to \mathbf{\flat}_{dR} \mathbf{B}^{n+1}U(1)$.

All the construction that we consider here in this introduction serve to _model_ this abstract operation. The $\infty$-connections that we considered yield [[resolution]]s of $\mathbf{B}^n U(1)$ and $\mathbf{B}G$ in terms of which the abstract morphisms are modeled as [[∞-anafunctor]]s.


##### $\infty$-Chern-Simons functionals

If we express $G$ by [[Lie integration]] of an [[∞-Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$, then the basic $\infty$-Chern-Weil homomorphism is modeled by composing an $\infty$-connection $(A_{vert}, A, \langle F_A\rangle)$ with the transgression of an invariant polynomial $(\mu, cs, \langle - \rangle)$ as follows

$$

$$

$$

  \;
  \;
  \;
  \left(

     CE(\mathfrak{g})
     &\stackrel{\mu}{\leftarrow}&
     CE(b^{n-1} \mathbb{R})

     : \langle F_A\rangle_\mu
     &&&
     curvature\;characteristic\;form
  }
  \right)
  \,.
$$

This evidently yields a morphism of simplicial presheaves

$$
  \exp(\mu)_{conn} : \exp(\mathfrak{g})_{conn} \to \exp(b^{n-1}\mathbb{R})_{conn} 
$$

and, upon restriction to the top two horizontal layers, a morphism

$$
  \exp(\mu)_{diff} : \exp(\mathfrak{g})_{diff} \to \exp(b^{n-1}\mathbb{R})_{diff} 
  \,.
$$

Projection onto the third horizontal component gives the map to the curvature classes

$$
  \exp(b^{n-1}\mathbb{R})_{diff} \to \mathbf{\flat}_{dR}\exp(b^{n} \mathbb{R})_{simp}
  \,,
$$

In total, this constitutes an $\infty$-anafunctor

$$

    \exp(\mathfrak{g})_{diff}

    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    \\
    \exp(\mathfrak{g})
  }
$$

Postcomposition with this is the simple $\infty$-Chern-Weil homomorphism: it sends a cocycle

$$
  \array{
    C(U) &\to& \exp(\mathfrak{g})
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}

###### Proposition

For $\mathfrak{g}$ an ordinary [[Lie algebra]] the image under $\tau_1(-)$ of this diagram constitutes the ordinary [[Chern-Weil homomorphism]] in that:

for $g$ the cocycle for a $G$-principal bundle, any ordinary [[connection on a bundle]] constitutes a lift $(g,\nabla)$ to the tip of the anafunctor and the morphism represented by that is the [[Cech cohomology|Cech]]-[[hypercohomology]] cocycle on $X$ with values in the truncated de Rham complex given by the globally defined curvature characteristic form $\langle F_\nabla \wedge \cdots \wedge F_\nabla\rangle$.

The ordinary [[Chern-Weil homomorphism]] refines from a map that assigns curvature characteristic forms, to a map that assigns [[secondary characteristic class]]es in the sense that it assigns [[circle n-bundles with connection]] whose curvature is this cuvature characteristic form.

The local connection forms of these circle bundles are given by the middle horizontal morphisms. These are the [[Chern-Simons form]]s 

$$
  \Omega^\bullet(U)
  \stackrel{A}{\leftarrow}
  W(\mathfrak{g})
  \stackrel{cs}{\leftarrow}
  W(b^{n-1} \mathbb{R})
  :
  cs(A)
 \,.
$$


##### Secondary characteristic classes

So far we discussed the untruncated $\exp(\mathfrak{g})_{conn}$. The real object of interest is the $k$-[[truncated]] version $\tau_k \exp(\mathfrak{g})_{conn}$ where $k \in \mathbb{N}$ is such that $\tau_k \exp)\mathfrak{g} \simeq \mathbf{B}G$ is the delooping of the $\infty$-Lie group in question. 

Under such a truncation, the integrated $\infty$-Lie algebra cocycle $exp(\mu) : exp(\mathfrak{g}) \to exp(b^{n-1}\mathbb{R})$ will no longer be a simplicial map. Instead, the [[period]]s of $\mu$ will cut out a [[lattice]] $\Gamma$ in $\mathbb{R}$, and $\exp(\mu)$ does descent to the quotient of $\mathbb{R}$ by that lattice

$$
  \exp(\mu) : \tau_k \exp(\mathfrak{g}) \to \mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{R}/\Gamma
  \,.
$$

We now say this again in more detail.

Suppose $\mathfrak{g}$ is such that the $(n+1)$-[[coskeleton]] $\mathbf{cosk}_{n+1} \exp(\mathfrak{g}) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} \simeq \mathbf{B}G$ for the desired $G$. Then the periods of $\mu$ over $(n+1)$-balls cut out a lattice $\Gamma \subset \mathbb{R}$ and thus we get an [[∞-anafunctor]]

$$
  \array{
    \mathbf{cosk}_{n+1} \exp(\mathfrak{g})_{diff}
    &\to&
    \mathbf{B}^{n}\mathbb{R}/\Gamma_{diff}
    &\to&
    \mathbf{\flat}_{dR} \mathbf{B}^{n+1} \mathbb{R}/\Gamma
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbf{B}G
  }
$$

This is [[curvature characteristic class]]. We may always restrict to genuine $\infty$-connections and refine

$$
  \array{
    \mathbf{cosk}_{n+1} \exp(\mathfrak{g})_{conn}
    &\to&
    \mathbf{B}^{n}\mathbb{R}/\Gamma_{conn}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbf{cosk}_{n+1} \exp(\mathfrak{g})_{diff}
    &\to&
    \mathbf{B}^{n}\mathbb{R}/\Gamma_{diff}
    &\to&
    \mathbf{\flat}_{dR} \mathbf{B}^{n+1} \mathbb{R}/\Gamma
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbf{B}G
  }
$$

which models the refined $\infty$-Chern-Weil homomorphism with values in [[ordinary differential cohomology]]

$$
  \mathbf{H}_{conn}(X,\mathbf{B}G)
  \to 
  \mathbf{H}_{conn}(X, \mathbf{B}^{n+1} \mathbb{R}/\Gamma)
$$


+-- {: .un_example}
###### Example

Applying this to the discussion of the [[Chern-Simons circle 3-bundle]] above, we find a differential refinement

$$
  \array{
    && \exp(\mathfrak{g})_{diff} &\stackrel{\exp(\mu)_{diff}}{\to}& \exp(b^{n-1}\mathbb{R})_{diff}
    \\
    && \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\int_{\Delta^\bullet}}}
    \\
    C(V) &\stackrel{(\hat g,\hat \nabla)}{\to}& \mathbf{cosk}_3\exp(\mathfrak{g})_{diff} 
    &\to&
    \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)_{diff}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    C(U) &\stackrel{(g,\nabla)}{\to}& \mathbf{B}G_{diff}
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    \\
    X
  }
  \,.
$$

Chasing components through this composite one finds that this descibes the cocycle in [[Deligne cohomology]] given by

$$
  (CS(\sigma_i^* \nabla) , \; \int_{\Delta^1} CS(\hat g_{i j}^* \nabla),
  \int_{\Delta^2} CS(\hat g_{i j k}^* \nabla), 
  \int_{\Delta^3} \hat g_{i j k l}^* \mu)
  \,.
$$

This is the cocycle for the [[circle n-bundle with connection]].

This is precisely the cocycles given in ([BrylMac](#BrylinskiMacLaughlin)).




## Summary

This section gives a concise summary of the constructions introduced above.


### For connections on $G$-principal 1-bundles

We have the following [[diffeological n-groupoid|diffeological 1- or 2-groupoids]].

* $\mathbf{\Pi}_1(X)$ -- the [[fundamental groupoid]] of $X$ (morphisms are [[homotopy]]-classes of paths);

* $\mathbf{P}_1(X)$ -- the [[path groupoid]] of $X$ (morphisms are [[thin homotopy]]-classes of paths)

* $\mathbf{P}_2(X)$ the [[path 2-groupoid]] (2-morphisms are [[thin homotopy]]-classes of disks).

* $\mathbf{\Pi}_2(X)$ the [[path n-groupoid|fundamental path 2-groupoid]] (2-morphisms are [[homotopy]]-classes of disks).

Let $G$ be a [[Lie group]]. We have the following Lie groupoids associated with that

* $\mathbf{B}G$ -- the coefficient for $G$-[[principal bundle]]s;

* $INN(G) = G//G$ -- the [[inner automorphism 2-group]] of $G$, a [[groupal model for universal principal infinity-bundles|groupal model for the universal principal bundle]];

* $\mathbf{B}INN(G)$ -- the coefficient for $INN(G)$-[[principal 2-bundle]];

* $\mathbf{B}G_{conn} := Hom_{Grpd(Diffeo)}(\mathbf{P}_1(-), \mathbf{B}G)$ -- the coefficient for $G$-principal bundles with [[connection on a bundle|connection]];

* $\mathbf{\flat} \mathbf{B}G := Hom_{Grpd(Diffeo)}(\Pi_2(-), \mathbf{B}INN(G))$ the coefficient for flat $G$-principal bundles with flat connection;

* $\mathbf{\flat} \mathbf{B}INN(G) := [\Pi_2(-), \mathbf{B}INN(G)]$ the coefficient for flat $INN(G)$-principal 2-bundles;

* $\mathbf{B}G_{diff} := \mathbf{\flat}\mathbf{B}INN(G) \times_{\mathbf{B}INN(G)} \mathbf{B}G $ -- the coefficient for $G$-[[principal bundle]]s with [[pseudo-connection]];


We have the following morphisms between these:

* $X \to \mathbf{P}_1(X)$ -- inclusion of constant paths into all paths;

* $\mathbf{P}_1(X) \to \mathbf{\Pi}_1(X)$ -- sends [[thin homotopy]]-classes of paths to their full homotopy classes;

* $\mathbf{\flat}\mathbf{B}G \to \mathbf{B}G_{conn}$ -- the morphism which forgets that a connection is flat;

* $\mathbf{B}G_{conn} \to \mathbf{B}G$ -- forgets the connection on a $G$-bundle, induced locally by $U \to \mathbf{P}_1(U)$;

* $\mathbf{B}G_{conn} \to \mathbf{\flat} \mathbf{B}INN(G)$ -- the morphism that fills in the integrated curvature between paths enclosing a surface;

* $\mathbf{B}G_{conn} \to \mathbf{B}G_{diff}$ the morphism that regards an ordinary connection as a special case of a pseudo-connection, induced as a morphism into a pullback by the two morphisms $\mathbf{B}G_{conn} \to \mathbf{B}G$ and $\mathbf{B}G_{conn} \to \mathbf{\flat} \mathbf{B}INN(G)$;



### For connections on $G$-principal $\infty$-bundles {#CWHomomorphismSummary}

For $\mathfrak{g}$ an [[∞-Lie algebra]] or more generally an [[∞-Lie algebroid]] and $\exp(\mathfrak{g}) \in [CartSp^{op},sSet]$ its untruncated [[Lie integration]], the  [[simplicial presheaf]] $\exp(\mathfrak{g})_{conn}$  of [[∞-Lie algebra valued differential forms]] is such that lifts $\nabla$

$$
  \array{
    && \exp(\mathfrak{g})_{conn}
    \\
    & {}^{\nabla}\nearrow & \downarrow
    \\
    C(U) &\stackrel{g}{\to}& \exp(\mathfrak{g})
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    \\
    X
  }
$$ 

of $\exp(\mathfrak{g})$-cocycles $g$ constitute a [[connection on an ∞-bundle]] on the [[principal ∞-bundle]] defined by $g$:

$$
  \exp(\mathfrak{g})_{conn}
  \subset 
  \exp(\mathfrak{g})_{conn'}
  : 
  (U,[k])
  \mapsto
  \left\{
  \array{
     \Omega^\bullet_{vert}(U \times \Delta^n)
     &\stackrel{A_{vert}}{\leftarrow}&
     CE(\mathfrak{g})
     &&&
     transition\;function\;/\;Cech\;cocycle
     \\
     \uparrow && \uparrow &&&& first\;Ehresmann\;condition
     \\
     \Omega^\bullet(U \times \Delta^n)
     &\stackrel{A}{\leftarrow}&
     W(\mathfrak{g})
     &&& 
     connection
     \\
     \uparrow && \uparrow &&&& second\; Ehresmann\;condition
     \\
     \Omega^\bullet(U)
     &\stackrel{\langle F_A\rangle}{\leftarrow}&
     inv(\mathfrak{g})
     &&&
     curvature\;characteristics
  }
  \right\}
  \,.
$$

For fixed $U \in $ [[CartSp]] and $k \in \Delta$ the sets on the right are sets of  [[∞-Lie algebra valued differential forms]] on $U \times \Delta^k$ subject two conditions:

1. restricted to the fibers the forms become flat and coincide with the forms that define the transition functions;

1. their [[curvature characteristic form]]s $\langle F_A \rangle$ descend to the base.

The subsheaf $\exp(\mathfrak{g})_{conn} \hookrightarrow \exp(\mathfrak{g})_{conn'}$ is that for every [[curvature]] form $F_A$ has no component along the simplicial directions.

Here $\Omega^\bullet(U \times \Delta^k)_{vert}$ are the [[vertical differential form]]s on the trivial simplex bundle $U \times \Delta^k \to U$ 
and on the right we have the canonical sequence [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] $\leftarrow$ [[Weil algebra]] $\leftarrow$ [[invariant polynomial]]s and all morphisms are [[dg-algebra]] morphisms. 

$$
  \array{
    CE(\mathfrak{g})  &&& G &&& Chevalley-Eilenberg\;algebra
    \\
    \uparrow &&& \downarrow 
    \\
    W(\mathfrak{g}) &&& \mathbf{E}G &&& Weil\;algebra
    \\
    \uparrow &&& \downarrow
    \\
    inv(\mathfrak{g}) &&& \mathbf{B}G &&& algebra\;of\;invariant\;polynomials
  }
  \,.
$$


A triple consisting of

* an [[∞-Lie algebra cocycle]] $\mu : \mathfrak{g} \to b^{n-1} \mathbb{R}$ 

* in transgression with an [[invariant polynomial]] $\langle - \rangle_\mu$

* mediated by a [[Chern-Simons element]] $cs_\mu$ 

is exhibited by a [[commuting diagram]]

$$
  \array{
     CE(\mathfrak{g}) &\stackrel{\mu}{\leftarrow}&
     CE(b^{k} \mathbb{R})
     &&&
     cocycle
     \\
     \uparrow && \uparrow
     \\
     W(\mathfrak{g}) &\stackrel{cs_\mu}{\leftarrow}&
     W(b^k \mathbb{R})
     &&&
     Chern-Simons\;element
     \\
     \uparrow && \uparrow
     \\
     inv(\mathfrak{g})
     &\stackrel{\langle -\rangle_\mu}{\leftarrow}&
     inv(b^k \mathbb{R}) 
     &&&
     invariant\;polynomial
  }
$$

in [[dgAlg]].


The $\infty$-Chern-Weil homomorphism at this untruncated level is postcomposition with the lift of

$$
  \exp(\mu)  : \exp(\mathfrak{g}) \to \exp(b^{n-1}\mathbb{R})
$$

to the map

$$
  \exp(\mu)_{conn} : \exp(\mathfrak{g})_{conn} \to \exp(b^{n-1}\mathbb{R})_{conn}
$$

given by forming the [[pasting]] composites

$$
  \array{
     \Omega^\bullet(U \times \Delta^n)_{vert}
     &\stackrel{A_{vert}}{\leftarrow}&
     CE(\mathfrak{g})
     &\stackrel{\mu}{\leftarrow}&
     CE(b^k \mathbb{R})
     & : \mu(A_{vert})
     &&&
     characteristic\;class
     \\
     \uparrow && \uparrow && \uparrow
     \\
     \Omega^\bullet(U \times \Delta^n)
     &\stackrel{A}{\leftarrow}&
     W(\mathfrak{g})
     &\stackrel{cs_\mu}{\leftarrow}&
     W(b^k \mathbb{R})
     &
     : cs_\mu(A)
     &&&
     Chern-Simons\;form
     \\
     \uparrow && \uparrow && \uparrow
     \\
     \Omega^\bullet(U)
     &\stackrel{\langle F_A\rangle}{\leftarrow}&
     inv(\mathfrak{g})
     &\stackrel{\langle -\rangle_\mu}{\leftarrow}&
     inv(b^k \mathbb{R})
     &
     : \langle F_A\rangle_\mu
     &&&
     curvature\;characteristic\;form
  }
  \,.
$$

This produces a $b^{n-1}\mathbb{R}$-valued connections with local connection forms the [[Chern-Simons form]]s $CS_\mu(A)$ and with curvature the [[curvature characteristic form]] $\langle - \rangle_\mu$.

Under [[truncated|truncation]] $\exp(\mathfrak{g}) \to \tau_n \exp(\mathfrak{g}) \simeq \mathbf{B}G$ this decends under suitable conditions to the genuine refine $\infty$-Chern-Weil homomorphism

$$
  \exp(\mu)_{conn} : 
  \mathbf{B}G_{conn} = \tau_n \exp(\mathfrak{g})_{conn}
  \to 
  (\mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{R}/\Gamma)_{conn}
$$

that sends principal $\infty$-bundles with connection to [[circle n-bundles with connection]].
