## Idea

_Geometric type theory_ is a conjectural extension of [[geometric logic]] to  an [[extensional type theory|extensional]] [[dependent type theory|dependent]] [[type theory]].  That is, it is supposed to be a dependent type theory which under the [[relation between category theory and type theory]] corresponds to [[sheaf toposes]], and is preserved by [[geometric morphisms]].

At present it is not clear exactly how such a type theory should be defined.
