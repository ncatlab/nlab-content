The **Cosmic Cube of $n$-Categories** describes more tractable versions of general weak $n$-[[n-category|categories]].

Its three axes each correspond to a form of simplification: groupoidal (giving only $n$-[[n-groupoid|groupoids]]), strict (giving only [[strict n-category|strict]] $n$-categories), and stable (giving only [[stable n-category|stable]] $n$-categories).  The cube is represented on page 10 of [[John Baez]]\'s talk _[What $n$-Categories Should Be Like](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/n_categories/what.pdf)_.

Taking any combination of choices of simplification, there are $8$ vertices of the cube; besides the $4$ listed above, we have [[strict n-groupoid]]s, [[stable n-groupoid]]s, [[stable strict n-category|stable strict]] $n$-categories, and of course [[stable strict n-groupoid]]s.

Each vertex also corresponds to a version of [[homotopy theory]].  The stable strict groupoid vertex corresponds to [[chain complexes]] as used in ordinary [[cohomology]]. [[Ronnie Brown]]'s [[nonabelian algebraic topology]] studies the version corresponding to the strict groupoid vertex.
