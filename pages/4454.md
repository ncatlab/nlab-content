The **Cosmic Cube of $n$-Categories** describes more tractable versions of general weak $n$-categories.

Its three axes each correspond to a form of simplification: groupoidal, strict, stable. It is represented on p. 10 of John Baez's talk [What $n$-Categories Should Be Like](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/n_categories/what.pdf).

Taking any combination of choices of simplification, there are 8 vertices of the cube. That corresponding to all three forms represents chain complexes as used in ordinary cohomology.
