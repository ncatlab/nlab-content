__Faà di Bruno formula__ is a remarkable combinatorial formula for higher derivatives of a composition of functions. There are various modern approaches to the related mathematics, using Joyal's theory of [[species]], operads, graphs/trees, Hopf algebras and so on.

> We prove a Faà di Bruno formula for the Green function in the bialgebra of P-trees, for any polynomial endofunctor P. The formula appears as relative homotopy cardinality of an equivalence of groupoids. For suitable choices of P, the result implies also formulae for Green functions in bialgebras of graphs.

In works of T. J. Robinson the formula is treated in the context of vertex algebras, calculus with [[formal power series]] and in logarithmic calculus, as well as in a connection to the [[umbral calculus]]:

> Using Dyson's identity for Green's functions as well as the link between the Faà di Bruno Hopf algebra and the Hopf algebras of Feynman graphs, its relation to the composition of formal power series is analyzed.
