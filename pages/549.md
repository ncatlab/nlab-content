##Overview##

Quillen's small object argument is a method for constructing functorial [[weak factorization system|weak factorization systems]] that are **cofibrantly generated** by a set of maps $I$. To say that a weak factorization system is cofibrantly generated by $I$ is to say that the right class $R$ of the system consists of precisely those maps  which have the right lifting property with respect to $I$

$$
  R = {}_{\perp} I
  \,.
$$

[[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: I've never seen this notation before.  I have seen ${}^{\perp} I$, but usually $\perp$ refers to [[orthogonality]], i.e. the class of maps satisfying a _unique_ lifting property.  I don't think there is a standard notation for the non-unique lifting property.  Some people write $Inj(I)$.  I like to write $I^{\boxslash}$  for the class of maps with the RLP for $I$; "boxslash" doesn't seem to be supported in itex, but I like it because it looks like a square with a lift in it.  Some people just use $\Box$ but that conflicts with a common notation for [[pushout product]]s.   Anyway, putting whatever symbol on the right of the $I$ indicates to me the class of maps having a _right_ lifting property.

The left class $L$ is then necessarily the class of maps who have the left lifting property with respect to the right class

$$
  L = R_\perp = ({}_{\perp} I)_\perp
  \,.
$$

When a weak factorization system is cofibrantly generated, another consequence of Quillen's small object argument is that the left class is the smallest [[saturated class of maps]] containing $I$.

Given that the classes of a cofibrantly generated weak factorization system are determined by lifting properties, the content of the small object argument is to produce the required factorizations. With care, this construction is _functorial_, so the result is a functorial weak factorization system.

If the category $C$ is just assumed to have all [[colimit]]s then the domains of the maps in $I$ are required to satisfy a smallness condition that says that any morphism from these objects to a sufficiently-large-directed colimit will factor through the base of the colimiting diagram. (See the reference by Hovey below.)
If the category is required to be a [[locally presentable category]] then no further condition is required (see the other references below).

###### Theorem (small object argument)

Let $C$ be a [[locally presentable category]] and
$I \subset Mor(C)$ a [[set]] of morphisms in $C$.

Then 

every morphism $f$ has a [[weak factorization system|factorization]] of the form

$$
  f : \stackrel{g \in cell(I)}{\to} 
   \stackrel{h \in {}_{\perp}I }{\to}
$$
where 
 
* ${}_{\perp}I$ is the set of morphisms with 
[[weak factorization system|right lifting property]] with respect to $I$

* $cell(I)$ is the set of [[transfinite composition]]s of 
  [[pushout]]s of morphisms in $I$;

[[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: In reply to Urs' comment at [[latest changes]], there are plenty of "modern" authors who use the small object argument in categories that are not locally presentable, such as topological spaces.  So the more precise statement is important.

##The Construction##

Given a morphism $f: X \rightarrow Y$, we would like to factor $f$ as $a : X \rightarrow Z$ followed by $q : Z \rightarrow Y$, where $q$ has the right lifting property with respect to all arrows in $I$. The arrow $a$ will be constructed to be a transfinite composite of pushouts of coproducts of maps in $i$. The left class of a weak factorization system is closed under all of these constructions, so $a$ will be in the left class cofibrantly generated by $i$.

For convenience, suppose our category is locally small. We can then consider the set $S_1$ of lifting problems between $f$ (on the right) and elements $i \in I$ (on the left). Form a coproduct over $S_1$ of the corresponding elements of $I$; the squares of $S_1$ then specify a canonical map from the domain of this morphism to $Z_0:=X$. The pushout of this diagram defines an object $Z_1$ and morphisms $a_1 : Z_0 \rightarrow Z_1$ and $q_1 : Z_1 \rightarrow Y$ factoring $f$. Intuitively, we have formed $Z_1$ by spheres for every attaching map from a domain of $I$ into $X=Z_0$.

Now, we iterate this construction with $q_1 : Z_1 \rightarrow Y$ in place of $f$ and taking colimits to construct $Z_{\alpha}$ for limit ordinals $\alpha$.  This construction does not converge, so we choose instead to stop at a sufficiently large ordinal $\beta$, chosen so that the domains of the maps in $I$ will satisfy the smallness property described above. Define $a$ to be the transfinite composite of the $a_{\alpha}$ and $q$ to be the induced map from the colimit $Z_{\beta}$ to $Y$.

It is clear from the construction that $a$ is in the left class of the weak factorization system, so it remains to show that $q$ has the right lifting property with respect to each $i \in I$. Given a lifting problem, the map from dom $i$ to dom $q$ factors through some $Z_{\alpha}$ by the smallness property. Because $Z_{\alpha+1}$ was defined to be a pushout over squares including this one, we have a map cod $i \rightarrow Z_{\alpha +1} \rightarrow Z_{\beta} =$ colim $Z_{\alpha}$, which is the desired lift.

###A note on Functoriality###

One of the important conclusions of the small object argument is that it is functorial.  But since (in its ordinary form) the process does not "converge" (in the up-to-isomorphism sense) but rather is merely stopped when it has gone far enough along, for functoriality we have to take care to terminate the construction at the _same_ ordinal $\beta$ for every input.

Additionally, in an [[enriched category|enriched]] situation, ideally one would like the factorizations to be an _enriched_ functor.  The version of the small object argument given above does not produce an enriched functor, since it takes coproducts over maps in an ordinary category.  It can be modified to produce an enriched functor by replacing these coproducts by [[copower]]s, but the resulting factorizations are only rarely homotopically well-behaved (in a model category, for instance).  One important special case when they are well-behaved is when all objects of the enriching category are cofibrant, as is the case for [[simplicial set]]s and for the [[folk model structure]] on [[Cat]].
