## Idea

In a [[monoidal category]] a _self-duality_ on a [[dualizable object]] $X$ is a choice of [[equivalence]] $X \simeq X^\ast$ with its [[dual object]].

## Properties

### Relation to $\dagger$-compact structure
 {#RelationToDaggerCompactStructure}

If each object $X$ of a [[compact closed category]] is equipped with a self-duality structure $X \simeq X^\ast$, then sending morphisms to their [[dual morphisms]] but with these identifications pre- and postcomposed

$$
  (-)^\dagger \;\colon\; 
  (X \stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow} Y)
  \mapsto
  (Y \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} Y^\ast \stackrel{f^\ast}{\longrightarrow} X^\ast \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} X)
$$

constitutes a [[dagger-compact category]] structure.

See for instance ([Selinger, remark 4.5](#Selinger)).

Applied for instance to the category of finite-dimensional [[inner product spaces]] this dagger-operation sends [[matrices]] to their [[transposed matrix]].
