## Idea

In **complex geometry** one studies _[[complex manifolds]]_ as a special case of how in general [[differential geometry]] one studies more generally [[smooth manifolds]].

In _complex [[analytic geometry]]_ one studies, more generally, [[complex analytic spaces]].

## Properties

### GAGA principle and relation to algebraic geometry

[[complex analytic geometry]] is closely related to [[algebraic geometry]] over the [[complex numbers]]. See at _[[GAGA]]_ for more on this.
