## Idea

Given a [[Lagrangian field theory]] with [[field bundle]] $E \overset{fb}{\to} \Sigma$ over [[spacetime]] $\Sigma$, then a _field history_ is a smooth [[section]] of this field bundle $\Phi \in \Gamma_\Sigma(E)$.

For every [[Cauchy surface]] $\Sigma_p \hookrightarrow \Sigma$ the [[restriction]] $\Phi\vert_{\Sigma_p}$ of $\Phi$ to $\Sigma_p$ may be thought of as the _field configuration_ "at that time" and hence the change of $\Phi\vert_{\Sigma_p}$ as the choice of Cauchy surface changes reflects the "history" of these configurations, whence the name.

For a [[sigma model]] field theory a field history may be thought of as a _trajectory_.

For more see at _[[geometry of physics -- perturbative quantum field theory]]_ the chapter _[Fields](geometry+of+physics+--+A+first+idea+of+quantum+field+theory#Fields)_.
