## Idea

An [[(∞,n)-category]] $\mathcal{C}$ is said to _have 1-adjoints_ if in its [[homotopy 2-category]] $Ho_2(\mathcal{C})$ every [[1-morphism]] is part of an [[adjunction]]. By [[recursion]], for $n \geq 3$ and $k \geq 2$ an [[(∞,n)-category]] _has $k$-adjoints_ if for every pair $X, Y$ of [[objects]] the [[hom object|hom (∞,n-1)-category]] $\mathcal{C}(X,Y)$ has adjoints for $(k-1)$-morphisms.

An $(\infty,n)$-category _has all adjoints_ (or just _has adjoints_, for short) if it has adjoints for $k$-morphisms for $0 \lt k \lt n$.

## Examples

* An [[(∞,n)-category of cobordisms]] has all adjoints.

## Related concepts

  **Abstract** [[topological chiral homology|Chiral]]/[[factorization homology]] gives a procedure for constructing a [[topological field theory]] from the data of an [[En-algebra]]. I'll explain a multi-object version of this construction which produces a topological field theory from the data of an $n$-category with adjoints. This construction is a consequence of a more primitive result which asserts an equivalence between [[(infinity,n)-category|n-categories]] with adjoints and "transversality sheaves" on [[framed manifold|framed]] $n$-[[manifolds]] - of which there is an abundance of examples.
