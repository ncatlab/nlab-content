## Idea

The ring of polynomials in $n$ variables has a linear basis $\{s_\lambda]}$ of __Schur functions__ (also called Schur polynomials) indexed by [[partition]]s $|\lambda| \vdash \lambda_1+\ldots +\lambda_n$, $\lambda_1\geq \lambda_2\geq \ldots \geq \lambda_n$. They are precisely the irreducible characters of f.d. representations of $GL_n$. 

## Definition

Given the partition $\lambda_1\geq \lambda_2\geq \ldots \geq \lambda_n$, the corresponding __Schur function__ is the $n\times n$-determinant
$$
s_\lambda = det (x_i^{\lambda_j})
$$

## Generalizations via Schur functors

[[Schur functors]] may be viewed as a categorification of Schur functions. In fact, the Schur functors make sense in more general symmetric monoidal categories than vector spaces. It is a theorem in the case of vector space that the trace of 
a Schur functor $\mathbf{S}_\lambda(V)\stackrel{\mathbf{S}_\lambda(g)}\to \mathbf{S}_\lambda(V)$ on an endomorphism $g\in GL(V)$ is the Schur function of the eigenvalues of $g$. Considering the trace of a Schur functor makes sense in a general situation allowing for Schur functors and for the trace ([[rigid monoidal category]]); of course choosing appropriate variables to express the trace may depend on a context.
