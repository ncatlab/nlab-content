## Idea

The ring of symmetric polynomials in $n$ variables has a linear basis $\{s_\lambda\}$ of __Schur polynomials__ indexed by [[partition]]s  $\lambda=\lambda_1\geq \lambda_2\geq \ldots \geq \lambda_n$ in $n$ parts. The Schur polynomials  are precisely the irreducible characters of finite dimensional polynomial representations of $GL_n$. 

## Definition

Given the partition $\lambda_1\geq \lambda_2\geq \ldots \geq \lambda_n$, the corresponding __Schur function__ is defined as follows. First define the $n\times n$-determinant (for any partition $\alpha$ in $n$ parts)
$$
a_\alpha = det (x_i^{\alpha_j}).
$$
Let $\delta=(n-1, n-2, \dots, 1, 0)$. Then the Schur polynomial
 attached to $\lambda$ is quotient
$$
s_{\lambda}=a_{\lambda+\delta}/a_{\delta}.
$$

## Generalizations via Schur functors

[[Schur functors]] may be viewed as a categorification of Schur functions. In fact, the Schur functors make sense in more general symmetric monoidal categories than vector spaces. It is a theorem in the case of vector space that the trace of 
a Schur functor $\mathbf{S}_\lambda(V)\stackrel{\mathbf{S}_\lambda(g)}\to \mathbf{S}_\lambda(V)$ on an endomorphism $g\in GL(V)$ is the Schur function of the eigenvalues of $g$. Considering the trace of a Schur functor makes sense in a general situation allowing for Schur functors and for the trace ([[rigid monoidal category]]); of course choosing appropriate variables to express the trace may depend on a context.
