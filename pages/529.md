Thinking of a [[group]], $G$,  as a special sort of [[category]], the **group algebra** (denoted $k[G]$ or $k G$) of a group  is just the [[category algebra]] of that category. 

##Extra structure

The group algebra is always a [[Hopf algebra]]. 

The group algebra is always a [[graded algebra]]. 


Sometimes instead of working over a [[ground field]] $k$, one allows $k$ to be a [[commutative unital ring]]. Then we talk about __group ring__ (though it is in fact a commutative unital $k$-[[commutative unital algebra|algebra]]). The integer group ring $\mathbb{Z} G$ is the most important example, extensively used in the [[representation theory]] of finite groups.
