## Idea

The term _double field theory_ has come to be used for [[field theory]] ([[prequantum field theory]]/[[quantum field theory]]) on [[spacetimes]] which are [[T-folds]] hence for "[[T-duality]]-[[equivariance|equivariant]] field theory".

## Related concepts

* [[exceptional field theory]]

* [[T-fold]]

## References

The idea of "doubled spacetime geometry" is a variant of the idea of [[T-folds]], due to
