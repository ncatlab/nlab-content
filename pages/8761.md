## Idea

In just about any concept of [[graph]], an **edge** is something which *connects two [[vertex|vertices]]*.  In a [[directed graph]] an edge is directed, whereas in an undirected graph (the default meaning of "graph" in contemporary combinatorics) it is not.

Edges are sometimes called **arcs** (less common in combinatorics, but sometimes used in other fields) or **lines** (e.g. [Harary, Chapter 2](#HararyGraphTheory)).  The latter is now unusual and considered old-fashioned, but survives in the standard technical term [[line graph]] (which is more common than "edge graph" for the same concept).  In more specialized contexts other terms are used.  For instance, if the [[graph]] is the [[quiver]] underlying a [[category]], then an edge is a [[morphism]]; while if it underlies a [[simplicial set]], then an edge is a 1-[[dimension|dimensional]] [[simplex]].

Historically, the use of "edge" for connections even in abstract graphs probably derives from the natural connections between [[graph theory]] and the theory of [[polyhedra]].  One such connection is [[Ernst Steinitz|Steinitz's]] [[Steinitz's theorem|1916 theorem]] on the one-dimensional skeleta of [[polyhedra]] in three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]].  However, some deplore the geometric connotations of "edge", with its geometric connotations of straightness and rigidity.
