## Definition

A __natural isomorphism__ $\eta\colon F \Rightarrow G$ between two [[functor]]s $F$ and $G$

$$
  \array{
    &  \nearrow \searrow^{F}
    \\
    C &{}^{\simeq}\Downarrow^\eta& D
    \\
    & \searrow \nearrow_{G}
  }
$$

is equivalently

* a [[natural transformation]] with a two-sided [[inverse]];

* a natural transformation each of whose components $\eta_c : F(c) \to G(c)$ for all $c \in Obj(C)$ is an [[isomorphism]] in $D$;

* an [[isomorphism]] in the [[functor category]] $[C,D]$.

In this case, we say that $F$ and $G$ are __naturally isomorphic__.


If you want to speak of '[[the]]' functor satisfying certain conditions, then it should be unique up to unique natural isomorphism.
