A _natural isomorphism_ is a [[natural transformation]] with a two-sided inverse.  A natural transformation is a natural isomorphism if and only if each of its components is an [[isomorphism].

Two functors in a given [[functor category]] are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] if and only if there exists a natural isomorphism between them; indeed, a natural isomorphism is precisely an isomorphism in a functor category.

If you want to speak of [[the]] functor satisfying certain conditions, then it should be unique up to unique natural isomorphism.
