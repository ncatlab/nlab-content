## Idea

By _noncommutative stable homotopy theory_ is meant an analog of classical _[[stable homotopy theory]]_ obtained as one passes from [[topology]] to [[noncommutative topology]], hence as one generalizes [[topological spaces]] to non-neccesarily commutative (formal duals of) [[C*-algebras]].

The concrete implementation of such _noncommutative stable homotopy theory_ is usually taken to be _[[KK-theory]]_ or rather _[[E-theory]]_. See there for details.

## References

A reference that mentions the term "noncommutative stable homotopy theory" explicitly is 

* Martin Grensing, _Noncommutative stable homotopy theory_ ([arXiv:1302.4751](http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4751))

But see at _[[KK-theory]]_ and _[[E-theory]]_ for more references.
