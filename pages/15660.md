## Idea

The notion of _dg-module_ over a [[dg-algebra]] is the specialization of [[module over a monoid]] to the category of [[chain complexes]]. More generally one can consider dg-modules over [[dg-algebras]] with many objects, i.e. [[dg-categories]].

## Definition

Let $A$ be a [[dg-algebra]] in an [[abelian category]], hence a [[monoid]] in the [[symmetric monoidal category]] of [[chain complexes]].

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition
A left (resp. right) **dg-module** over $A$ is a left (resp. right) [[module over a monoid|module]] over the [[monoid]] $A$.
=--

More generally let $T$ be a [[dg-category]].

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition
A left (resp. right) **dg-module** over $T$ is a [[module over an enriched category|module]] over $T$ in the sense of [[enriched category theory]]. That is, it is a functor of [[dg-categories]]
  $$ M : T^{op} \longrightarrow dg-mod_k $$
(resp. $M : T \longrightarrow dg-mod_k$) where $k$ is the base [[commutative ring]].
=--

Note that when $T$ is a [[dg-category]] with a single object, a dg-module over $T$ is the same thing as a dg-module over the [[dg-algebra]] of [[endomorphisms]] of the unique object.

## Properties

By general [[enriched category theory]], dg-modules themselves form a [[dg-category]] which we denote $dg-mod_T$. The [[enriched Yoneda lemma|enriched Yoneda embedding]] is a [[fully faithful]] functor of [[dg-categories]]
  $$ h : T \hookrightarrow dg-mod_T. $$

There are [[dg-model structures]] on the category of [[dg-modules]], described at [[model structures on dg-modules]], where the [[weak equivalences]] are objectwise [[quasi-isomorphisms]] of [[chain complexes]]. The [[(infinity,1)-category]] or [[dg-category]] presented by these model structures is called the [[derived category of a dg-category|derived category]] of $T$, and denoted $D(T)$. It is a [[stable (infinity,1)-category]] or [[pretriangulated dg-category]].

The [[triangulated subcategory]] generated by the [[representable presheaves]] is denoted $tri(A) \subset D(A)$, and the [[thick subcategory|thick]] [[triangulated subcategory]] generated by the [[representable presheaves]] is denoted $perf(A) \subset D(A)$.  It coincides with the [[full subcategory]] of [[compact objects]] of $D(A)$.
