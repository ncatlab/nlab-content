Let $A$ be a [[dg-category]] over a [[commutative ring]] $k$.  A **dg-presheaf** on $A$ is a [[functor]] $A^\op \to Ch(k)$, where $Ch(k)$ denotes the [[dg-category]] of [[chain complexes]] of $k$-[[modules]].  Hence it is a [[presheaf]] on $A$ in the $Ch(k)$-enriched context.  Dg-presheaves are often called _(right) dg-modules_ due to the fact that a [[dg-category]] with a single object is a [[dg-algebra]], and a [[dg-presheaf]] is a [[dg-module]] in the traditional sense.

There is a projective [[model structures]] on the category of dg-presheaves, where the [[weak equivalences]] are object-wise [[quasi-isomorphisms]] of [[chain complexes]], and the [[fibrations]] are object-wise [[epimorphisms]].  This model structure is compatible with the canonical [[enriched category|enrichment]] over $Ch(k)$ (in the sense of [[enriched model category]]) and gives rise to a [[dg-category]] whose objects are the [[cofibrant]] dg-presheaves.  We denote this dg-category by $P(A)$, and call it the **dg-category of dg-presheaves** on $A$.  Note that this is a _locally fibrant_ dg-category, i.e. fibrant with respect to the [[Dwyer-Kan model structure on dg-categories]].  This is why $P(A)$ is preferrable to the bigger category of all dg-presheaves.

Note that the usual [[enriched Yoneda lemma|enriched Yoneda embedding]] takes values in $P(A)$ and gives a [[fully faithful]] dg-functor $h : A \hookrightarrow P(A)$.

The [[homotopy category]] $ho(P(A))$ of the dg-category of dg-presheaves is often called the [[derived category]] of $A$, and denoted by $D(A)$.  There is a canonical [[triangulated structure]] on $D(A)$ (TODO: describe this).

The [[triangulated subcategory]] generated by the [[representable presheaves]] is denoted $tri(A) \subset D(A)$, and the [[thick subcategory|thick]] [[triangulated subcategory]] generated by the [[representable presheaves]] is denoted $perf(A) \subset D(A)$.  It coincides with the [[full subcategory]] of [[compact objects]] of $D(A)$.
