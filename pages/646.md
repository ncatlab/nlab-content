#Idea#
For [[nice topological space|‘nice’ spaces]], i.e., CW-complexes, a weak [[homotopy equivalence]] is the same as a homotopy equivalence.  Here a weak homotopy equivalence is a map which induces an isomorphism on all [[homotopy group]]s:
$$f:X\to Y \Leftrightarrow \pi_k(f) : \pi_k(X)\to \pi_k(Y)$$
for all $k \geq 0$ and all choices of base point.

(For [[simplicial group]]s or [[groupoid]]s, we have a similar notion.)

What if we only have that $\pi_k(f)$ is an isomorphism up to some dimension, $n$, what can we say about the 'homotopy types'. Any space is equivalent in this truncated form to a space with trivial homotopy groups above level $n$, so can we find reasonably complete _algebraic_ models for such $n$-types.

We will use simplicial groups and simplicial groupoids rather than spaces below as they are already partially algebraicised.
 
#Definitions#



 A morphism $f : G \to H$ of simplicial group(oid)s is an **$n$-equivalence** if the induced homomorphisms, $\pi_k(f) : \pi_k(G)\to \pi_k(H)$ are isomorphisms for all $k \lt n$.
 
 Inverting the $n$-equivalences in $Simp.Grps$ gives a category $Ho_n(Simp.Grps)$ and two simplicial groups have the same **$n$-type** if they are isomorphic in $Ho_n(Simp.Grps)$.

#Remarks#

Considerable effort has gone into finding 'good' algebraic models for (connected) homotopy $n$-types. In low dimensions the results are 'old' or 'classical'.  (We will consider connected cases only.  The extension to the non-connected case is 'routine'.)

* The 1-type of a connected space is completely determined by its [[fundamental group]], so groups form an algebraic model for [[homotopy 1-type]]s. For the non pointed case, we can say [[groupoid]]s form an algebraic model. 

* [[crossed module|Crossed modules]] form an algebraic model for homotopy [[2-type]]s by a result of Mac Lane and Whitehead
     
     *  S. Mac Lane and J. H. C. Whitehead, _On the 3-type of a complex_, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 36, (1950), 41 – 48.

The use of crossed modules of groupoids and their [[classifying space]] for the non pointed case is explained under [[2-type]]. 


*  Finding the algebraic model for the $n$-types is just a start.  Ideally one searches for algebraic models of all the higher homotopy structure as well.

* The method initiated by J.H.C. Whitehead was to approximate homotopy theory by models which analysed particular types of behaviour. One of his most widely followed models is that of [[stable homotopy theory]]. The opposite method was to find algebraic models of restricted classes of spaces, such as 2-types, or with cells in a small range of dimensions.  H.-J. Baues has followed up many of the latter ideas. 

It is sensible to regard [[crossed complex|crossed complexes]] as giving a _linear_ model of homotopy types. These crossed complexes are equivalent to [[strict omega-groupoid|strict globular]] $\infty$-groupoids. Although these are restricted model of homotopy types, they are convenient in many aspects, because of the many analogies with the familiar [[chain complex]]es. 

Crossed complexes capture operations of the fundamental groupoid, but not quadratic information such as Whitehead products (for dimensions $\gt 1$). However one can define $n$-fold crossed complexes inductively as crossed complexes internal to $(n-1)$-fold crossed complexes. So one can give the 

*(Conjecture) double crossed complexes capture the quadratic information on homotopy types, triple crossed complexes capture the cubic information, etc., etc. 

This has the possibility of leading to computations, by applying [[van Kampen theorem]]s to specific levels.
