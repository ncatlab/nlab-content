A polynomial all of whose monomial terms have the same degree. See also [[polynomial]].

If $R$ is a commutative semi-ring, then the set $R_{n}[X_{1},...,X_{q}]$ of homogeneous polynomials of degree $n$ with variables $X_{1},...,X_{q}$ is given by all the expressions of the form $\underset{\substack{0\le i_{1},...,i_{q} \le n\\ i_{1}+...+i_{q} = n}}{\sum} a_{i_{1},...,i_{q}}X_{1}^{i_{1}}...X_{q}^{i_{q}}$.

A specific property of homogeneous polynomials is the Euler identity:

\begin{theorem}
If $R$ is a commutative semi-ring and if $P \in R[X_{1},...,X_{q}]$, then $n.P = \underset{1 \le k \le q}{\sum} \frac{\partial P}{\partial X_{k}}X_{k}$ iff $P \in R_{n}[X_{1},...,X_{q}]$.
\end{theorem}
