## Idea

The __spin__ of a [[particle]] in [[quantum mechanics]]/[[quantum field theory]] is its intrinsic [[angular momentum]], but subject to the possibility that the particle may be a [[fermion]] so that that its [[angular momentum]] is not determined by the [[representation theory]] of the [[special orthogonal group]], but of the [[spin group]].

## Properties

### Spin-Statistics theorem

By the [[spin-statistics theorem]], the spin of any [[elementary particle]] must be (in magnitude) half of an [[integer]] multiple of [[Planck's constant]] ($\hbar = h/2\pi$), an integer if the particle is a [[boson]] but only a half-integer if the particle is a [[fermion]].
