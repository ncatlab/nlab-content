The __spin__ of a [[physics|physical]] system is its intrinsic [[angular momentum]].

By the [[spin-statistics theorem]], the spin of any [[elementary particle]] must be (in magnitude) half of an [[integer]] multiple of [[Dirac's constant]] ($\hbar = h/2\pi$), an integer if the particle is a [[boson]] but only a half-integer if the particle is a [[fermion]].
