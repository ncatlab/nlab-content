## Idea

In the [[standard model of particle physics]], the [[hadrons]], such as the [[proton]], are supposedly [[bound states]] of three [[quarks]], the latter being the fundamental objects in [[quantum chromodynamics]]. In fact, quarks are thought to be _[[confinement|confined]]_ to such colour-charge-neutral [[bound states]]. However, at the relevant [[energy]]-scale [[QCD]] is "strongly coupled" (the [[coupling constant]] is large) so that established methods of [[perturbative quantum field theory]] do not apply (possibly standard pQFT has to be supplied with an [[interacting vacuum state]], or more general methods of [[non-perturbative quantum field theory]] are needed, all of which remains open). As a result, the expected _[[confinement]]_ of [[quarks]] to [[hadrons]] is theoretically an open problem, known in [[mathematical physics]] essentially as the _[[mass gap problem]]_.

Therefore, together with the very existence of [[hadrons]], also their basic properties, such as [[mass]] and [[spin]] do not currently have a derivation from first principles in [[QCD]]. There exists qualitative understanding and there exists computer simulation in [[lattice QCD]]. When [[experiment]] showed that also these heuristics drastically failed to provide an understanding of the [[spin]] of the [[proton]] in terms of the spin of its constitutents [[quarks]] and of the [[gluons]] binding these quarks together, the situation was called the _proton spin crisis_ or _proton spin puzzle_.
