## Idea
 {#Idea}

A _$\sigma$-model_ is a particular kind of [[classical field theory]], which induces its quantization to a [[quantum field theory]].  The basic data describing a specific $\sigma$-model is some kind ot "[[space]]" $X$, in a [[category]] of "[[spaces]]" which includes [[smooth manifolds]].  We call $X$ the [[target space]], and we define the "[[configuration space]] of fields" $Conf_\Sigma$  over a manifold $\Sigma$ to be the [[mapping space]] $Map(\Sigma, X)$.  That is, a "configuration of fields" over a manifold $\Sigma$ is like an an $X$-valued [[function]] on $\Sigma$.

We assign a [[dimension]] $n \in \mathbb{N}$ to our $\sigma$-model, take $dim \Sigma \leq n$ and assume that [[target space]] $X$ is equipped with a "[[circle n-bundle with connection]]".  

For $n = 1$ this is an ordinary [[circle bundle]] [[connection on a bundle|with connection]] and models a configuration of the [[electromagnetic field]] on $X$. To distinguish this "field" on $X$ from the fields on $\Sigma$ we speak of a _[[background gauge field]]_. (This remains fixed background data unless and until we pass to _[[second quantization]]_ .) A field configuration $\Sigma \to X$ on $\Sigma$ models a trajectory of a [[charge]]d particle subject to the [[force]]s exerted by this background field.

For $n = 2$, a circle $n$-bundle with connection is a [[circle n-group|circle 2-group]] [[principal 2-bundle]] or equivalently a [[bundle gerbe]] with connection. This models a "higher electromagnetic field", called a [[Kalb-Ramond field]]. Now $\Sigma$ is taken to be 2-dimensional and a map $\Sigma \to X$ models the trajectory of a [[string]] on $X$, subject to forces exerted on it by this higher order field.

This pattern continues. In the next dimension a [[membrane]] with 3-dimensional [[worldvolume]] is charged under a [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle 3-bundle]] with connection, for instance something called the [[supergravity C-field]].

While one can speak of [[principal ∞-bundles|higher bundles]] in full generality and full analogy to ordinary [[principal bundle]]s, it is useful to observe that any circle $n$-bundle is characterized by a classifying map $\alpha : X \to \mathbf{B}^n U(1)$ in our category of [[space]]s, so we can just think about classifying maps instead.  Here $U(1)$ is the [[circle group]], and $\mathbf{B}^n$ denotes its $n$th _[[delooping]]_ ; thus such a map is also a sort of [[cocycle]] in "[[smooth infinity-groupoid|smooth]] $n$th [[cohomology]] of $X$ with coefficients in $U(1)$". The additional data of a _connection_ refines this to a cocycle in _[[ordinary differential cohomology|differential cohomology]]_ of $X$.

Such connection data $\nabla$ on a circle $n$-bundle defines -- and is defined by -- a notion of [[higher parallel transport]] over $n$-dimensional trajectories: for closed $n$-dimensional $\Sigma$ it defines a map $hol : (\gamma : \Sigma \to X) \mapsto \exp(i \int_\Sigma \gamma^*\nabla) \in U(1)$ that sends trajectories to elements in $U(1)$: the [[holonomy]] of $\nabla$ over $\Sigma$, given by [[integration]] of local data over $\Sigma$. The local data being integrated is called the _[[Lagrangian]]_ of the $\sigma$-model. Its integral is called the [[action functional]]. 

In the _[[QFT|quantum]]_ $\sigma$-model one considers in turn the integral of the [[action functional]] over all of [[configuration space]]: the "[[path integral]]". In the _classical $\sigma$-model_ one considers only the [[critical locus]] of the action functional (where the rough idea is that the path integral to some approximation localizes around the critical locus). Points in this critical locus are said to be configurations that satisfy the "[[Euler-Lagrange equations]] of motion". These are supposed to be the physically realized trajectories among all of them, in the classical approximation.

Finally, just like an ordinary [[circle group]]-[[principal bundle]] has an [[associated bundle|associated]] [[vector bundle]] once we fix a [[representation]] of $U(1)$ to be the [[fiber]]s, any "[[circle n-bundle]]" has an associated "[[n-vector bundle]]" once we fix a "[[∞-representation]]" $\rho : \mathbf{B}^n U(1) \to n Vect$ on "[[n-vector spaces]]".  Just as for the ordinary $U(1)$, here we usually pick the canonical 1-dimensional such "representation".  Finally, we define bundles $V_\Sigma : Conf_\Sigma \to \mathcal{C}$ of "internal states" by [[transgression]] of these associated bundles.

The passage from [[principal ∞-bundle]]s to [[associated ∞-bundle]]s is necessary for the description of the quantum $\sigma$-model: it assigns in positive codimension spaces of [[section]]s of these associated bundles. For a 1-categorical description of the resulting [[QFT]] ordinary vector bundles (assigned in codimension 1) would suffice, but the $\sigma$-model should determine much more: an [[extended quantum field theory]]. This requires sections of higher vector bundles. For instance for $n = 2$ some boundary conditions of the $\sigma$-model are given by sections of the background [[n-vector bundle|2-vector bundle]]: these are the [[twisted bundle|twisted vector bundles]] known as the [[Chan-Paton bundles]] on the [[boundary]]-[[D-brane]]s of the [[string]]. (...)

We now try to fill this with life by spelling out some standard examples. Further [below](Exposition) we look at precise formalizations of the situation.


## Terminology and history
 {#TerminologyAndHistory}

In physics one tends to speak of a _model_ if one specifies a particular [[quantum field theory]] for describing a particular situation, for instance by specifying a [[Lagrangian]] or [[local action functional]] on some [[configuration space]]. This is traditionally not meant in the mathematical sense of _[[model]]_ of some [[theory]]. But in light of progress of mathematically formalizing [[quantum field theory]] (see [[FQFT]] and [[AQFT]]), it can with hindsight be interpreted in this way: 

a $\sigma$-model is supposed to be a type of [[model]] for the [[theory]] called [[quantum field theory]]. This sounds like a tautology, but much effort in mathematical physics is devoted to eventually making this a precise statement. In special cases and toy examples this has been achieved, but for the examples that seem to be directly relevant for the phenomenological description of the observed world, lots of clues still seem to be missing.

As to the "$\sigma$" in "$\sigma$-model": back in the 1960s people were interested in a hypothetical particle called the 
$\sigma$-particle.  [[Murray Gell-Mann]] came up with a theory of them.  It was called ‘the $\sigma$-model’.  It was an old-fashioned field theory where the field took values in a vector space.   Then someone came up with a modified version of the σ-model where the field took values in some other [[manifold]] and this was called ‘the nonlinear σ-model’.  

While the parameter space (the domain space of the fields) of the original $\sigma$-models was supposed to be our [[spacetime]] and the target space was some abstract space, with the advent of [[string theory]] the nonlinear $\sigma$-models gained importance as quantum field theories whose _target space_ is [[spacetime]] $X$ and whose parameter space is some low dimensional space, usually denoted $\Sigma$. A field configuration $\Sigma \to X$ is then interpreted as being the trajectory of an extended fundamental particle -- a fundamental [[brane]] -- in $X$, and the $\sigma$-model describes the quantum mechanics of that brane propagating in $X$.

In particular the [[quantum mechanics]] of a [[relativistic particle]] propagating on $X$ is described by a $\sigma$-model on the [[real line]] $\Sigma = \mathbb{R}$ -- the _worldline_ of the particle.

In [[string theory]] one considers 2-[[dimension]]al $\Sigma$ and thinks of maps $\Sigma \to X$ as being the _worldsheets_ of the trajectory of a string propagating in spacetime.

In the context of [[11-dimensional supergravity]] there is a $\sigma$-model with 3-dimensional $\Sigma$, describing the propagation of a [[membrane]] in [[spacetime]].


## Exposition of classical sigma-models
 {#ExpositionClassical}

We survey, starting from the very basics, [[classical field theory]] aspects of $\sigma$-models that describe dynamics of [[particle]]s, [[strings]]s and [[brane]]s on geometric [[target space]]s.


### The Newtonian particle
 {#ExpositionNewtonianParticle}

With hindsight, the earliest $\sigma$-model ever considered was also the very origin of the science of [[physics]]:

In order to describe the motion of matter [[particles]] in [[space]], [[Isaac Newton]] wrote down a [[differential equation]] with the famous symbols

$$
  \vec F = m \vec a 
  \,.
$$

More in detail, this is meant to describe the following situation:

* write $X := \mathbb{R}^3$ for the [[Cartesian space]] of [[dimension]] 3; think of this as a model for physics space;

* write $\Sigma := \mathbb{R}$ for the [[Cartesian space]] of [[dimensional]] 1; think of this as the abstract trajectory of a point particle;

* write $\gamma : \Sigma \to X$ for a [[smooth function]]; think of this as an actual trajectory of a point particle in $X$;

  write furthermore

  * $\vec v := \dot \gamma \in Hom(T \Sigma, T X)$ for the [[derivative]] of $\gamma$; think of this as the [[velocity]] of the particle; and

  * $\vec a := \ddot \gamma$ for the second [[derivative]], the [[acceleration]] of the particle (strictly speaking this is the [[covariant derivative]] with respect to the trivial [[connection on a bundle|connection]] on the (canonically trivialized) [[tangent bundle]] on $\mathbb{R}^3$, see [below](RelativisticParticle) for the fully fledged discussion).

We call then the collection of all [[smooth function]]s

$$
  Conf := C^\infty(\Sigma, X)
$$

the [[configuration space]] of a physical model of a point particle propagating on $X$. 


In order to define the model -- the model of some physical situation -- 

* pick a [[vector field]] $\vec F \in \Gamma(T X)$ on $X$. Think of this as expressing at each point a [[force]] acting on the particle with trajectory.

  For instance $\vec F := q \vec E$ could be an [[electromagnetic field|electric field]] $\vec E$ influencing the propagation of an electrically charged particle of [[charge]] $q$.

In modern language we may say:

* $\Sigma$ is the [[worldline]] of the particle;

* $X$ is the [[target space]] (expressing the fact that it is the [[codomain]] of a function $\gamma : \Sigma \to X$)

* $\vec F$ is the [[background gauge field]];

and the collection $(\Sigma, X, \vec F)$ of all three is a _$\sigma$-model_ . 

Given this data, the space of solutions to the original [[differential equation]]

$$
  P := \{ \gamma \in Conf | \forall t \in \mathbb{R} : \vec F_{\gamma(t)} = m \vec a(t) \}
$$

is called the [[covariant phase space]] of the model. The configurations in $P \subset Conf$ have the interpretation of being those potential configurations, that describe actual trajectories of [[particle]]s observed in nature.

Notice that in the case of vanishing [[force]] field $\vec F = 0$, the [[equations of motion]] of the [Newtonian particle](#ExpositionNewtonianParticle)

$$
  \vec a = 0
$$

may be read as characterizing precisely the [[geodesic]]s in $\mathbb{R}^3$ regarded as a [[Riemannian manifold]] using the canonical [[metric]]. This is a special and limiting case of the [relativistic particle](#RelativisticParticle) discussed below.

A cautionary note is in order. While the Newtonian particle may serve as an introductory example for motivating the concept of $\sigma$-models, it in general lacks some of the nice properties that later on we shall take to be characteristic of $\sigma$-models. Mainly this is due to the fact that the Newtonian particle is but a limiting approximation to the [[relativistic particle]] to which we turn next.


### The relativistic particle
 {#RelativisticParticle}


The Newtonian particle propagating on $\mathbb{R}^3$, discussed [above](#ExpositionNewtonianParticle), is a special and limiting case of a particle propagating on a 4-dimensional [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]: [[spacetime]]. For historical reasons (the same that led to the theory of [[gravity]] being called a theory of _[[general relativity|relativity]]_ ) this is called the _[[relativistic particle]]_ .

The $\sigma$-model describing the relativistic particle is the following.

* [[target space|Target space]] is a  [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]] $(X,g)$, thought of as [[spacetime]].

* Parameter space $\Sigma = \mathbb{R}$ is the [[real line]], thought of as the abstract [[worldline]] of the particle.

* The [[background gauge field]] is given by a [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle bundle with connection]], which for the moment we shall assume to be topologically trivial and hence be equivalently given by a smooth [[differential form|1-form]] $A \in \Omega^1(X)$. Its [[curvature]] [[exterior derivative]] $F := d A$ is the [[field strength]] of an [[electromagnetic field]] on $X$. 

* The [[configuration space]] is the [[quotient]] (or rather [[action groupoid]])

  $$
    Conf = C^\infty(\mathbb{R}, X)//Diff(\mathbb{R})
    \,,
  $$

  of [[smooth function]]s $\Sigma \to X$ by [[diffeomorphism]]s $\Sigma \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} \Sigma$. Each [[object]] in [[cofiguration space]] is a trajectory $\gamma : \Sigma \to X$ of a particle in spacetime, each morphism/equivalence $\gamma_1 \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} \gamma_2$ : a [[gauge transformation]].

* The [[covariant phase space]] -- the subspace of the configuration space of those configurations that satisfy the [[equations of motion]] -- is defined to be

  $$
    P =
    \{ [\gamma] \in Conf
     |\;\;
    m g(\nabla_{\dot \gamma} \dot \gamma/{\vert \dot \gamma}\vert , - ) =  q F(\dot \gamma, -)
    \;\; \}
    \subset Conf
    \,,
  $$

  where 

  * $\nabla$ denotes the [[covariant derivative]] of the [[Levi-Civita connection]] of the background metric $g$ on the [[tangent bundle]] $T X$ of $X$;

  * the equation is taken to hold in each [[cotangent space]] $T^*_{\gamma(\tau)} X$ for each $\tau \in \mathbb{R}$.

To see what this means, consider some special cases. First regard the case that the background field strenght vanishes, $F = 0$. Then the equations of motion reduce to

$$
  \nabla_{\dot \gamma} \dot \gamma = 0 
  \,.
$$

This says that the trajectory $\gamma$ exhibits [[parallel transport]] of its tangent vectors with respect to the [[Levi-Civita connection]] of the background metric. These curves are precisely the _[[geodesics]]_ of the background geometry. This models motion under the [[force]] exerted by the field of [[gravity]] on our particle.

In the even more special case that $X$ is [[Minkowski spacetime]], where we may find a global [[coordinate chart]] $(\mathbb{R}^4, \eta) \simeq (X,g)$, this are exactly the straight lines in $\mathbb{R}^4$. Given any such, there is precisely one representative in the diffeomorphism class for which $\mathbb{R} \stackrel{\gamma}{\to} \mathbb{R}^4 \stackrel{x^0}{\to} \mathbb{R}$ is the identity, hence for which the [[worldline]] parameter coincides precisely with the chosen global time coordinate $t := x^0$ on $\mathbb{R}^4$. For those the equations of motions are again those of the free Newtonian particle $\vec a = 0$.

Remaining in the case that $X$ is [[Minkowski space]] but allowing now a nontrivial background field, notice that we may write the 2-form $F$ always as

$$
  F = \vec E_i \cdot d x^i \wedge d t + \vec B^i \epsilon_{i j k} d x^j \wedge d x^j
  \,,
$$

where $\vec E \in \mathbb{R}^3$ is the electric field strength vector and $\vec B \in \mathbb{R}^3$ the magnetic field strength vector. The spatial part of the above equations of motion are in this case again as for a Newtonian particle

$$
  m \vec a = q \vec E + q \vec v \times \vec B
  \,,
$$

where in the second term we have the [[cross product]] of vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$. The [[force]] on the right is the _[[Lorentz force]]_ exerted by an electromagnetic field on a charged particle.

Notice that the equations of motion imply, generally, that the [[norm]] of $\dot \gamma$ is constant along the trajectory

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \frac{d}{d \tau} g(\dot \gamma, \dot \gamma)
    &= 2 g(\nabla_{\dot \gamma} \dot \gamma, \dot \gamma)
    \\
    & = 
    2 g(g^{-1}(F(\dot \gamma,-), -), \dot \gamma)
    \\
    & \propto F(\dot \gamma, \dot \gamma)
    \\
    & = 
    0
  \end{aligned}
   \,.
$$

Therefore a trajectory that solves the equations of motion and whose tangent vector is [[timelike]] or [[spacelike]] or [[lightlike]], respectively at any instant is so throughout. In particular, no choice of gravitational and electromagnetic background field strength can accelerate a physical particle from being timelike to being light-like.

Experiments around the second half of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century established that this covariant phase space correctly describes the dynamics of gravitationally and electromagnetically charged relativistic particles,. But also formally this phase space is not a randomly chosen space; instead, it is the [[critical locus]] of a (mathematically) natural [[action functional]].

The points in the [[covariant phase space]]

$$
  P := \{ [\gamma] \in Conf | 
   m g(\nabla_{\dot \gamma} \dot \gamma / {\vert \dot \gamma}\vert,-) =  q\iota_{\dot \gamma} F
    \}
  \subset Conf 
$$

happen to be the local critical points of the [[functional]]

$$
  S : Conf \to \mathbb{R}
$$

given by

\[
  \label{ParticleActionForGlobalA}
  \begin{aligned}
    S([\gamma]) 
     & := 
     S_{kin}([\gamma])
     +
     S_{gauge}([\gamma])
     \\
     & 
     := 
     m \int_\Sigma dvol(\gamma^*g)  + q \int_\Sigma \gamma^* A
  \end{aligned}
  \,,
\]

where on the left we have the integral of the [[volume form]] of the pullback $\gamma^* g \in Sym^2 T^* \Sigma$ of the metric on target space to the [[worldline]].

This is called the _[[action functional]]_ of the relativistic particle $\sigma$-model. The first summand is called the _kinetic action_ , the second is calle the _gauge coupling_  action. 

Typically one characterizes $\sigma$-models in terms of such action functionals, so that the [[covariant phase space]] is then given as their [[critical locus]]. This usually yields a simpler and deeper description of the model. 

Notably the above action functional has an evident generalization to the case where the background [[electromagnetic field]] is not given by a globally defined 1-form, but more generally by a [[circle n-bundle with connection|cicle bundle with connection]] $\nabla$: if we pass to the exponentiated action functional

$$
  \exp(i S(-)) : Conf \to U(1)
$$

$$
  \exp(i S(\gamma)) = 
  \exp(S_{kin}(\gamma))
   \;\;
  \exp(i q \int_\Sigma \gamma^* A)
$$

the second factor is precisely the [[holonomy]] of $\nabla$ over the worldline. Hence for general electromagnetic background gauge fields the action functional is (assuming for simplicity now closed curves with $\Sigma = S^1$)

$$
  \exp(i S(\gamma))   
  = 
  \exp(S_{kin}(\gamma))
   \;\;
  hol(\nabla, \gamma)
  \,.
$$

This is the beginning of an important pattern: most $\sigma$-models are determined by a kind of higher [[gauge field]] $\nabla$ on [[target space]] (a cocycle in the [[differential cohomology]] of [[target space]]) and their dynamics is determined by an [[action functional]] that is the [[higher parallel transport|higher holonomy]] functional of this gauge field. 

At the same time the kinetic action functional factor is usually to be understood as part of the [[measure]] on [[configuration space]] $Conf$. For the particle this has been made precise: the [[path integral]] 

$$
 \int_{\gamma \in Conf} hol(\nabla,\gamma) \;\;\exp(i S_{kin}(\gamma)) [d \gamma]
  :=
 \int_{\gamma \in Conf} hol(\nabla,\gamma) d \mu_{Wien}
$$

can be interpreted as the [[integral]] with respect to the [[Wiener measure]] on path space (after [[Wick rotation]], at least). The kinetic part of the action functional is then absorbed into the Wiener measure $d \mu_{Wien}$

$$
  \exp(i S_{kin}(\gamma)) [d\gamma] := d \mu_{Wien}
  \,;
$$

(at least after replacing the kinetic [[Nambu-Goto action]] by the classically equivalent [[Polyakov action]])
and the path integral is just the "expectation value" (after Wick rotation) of the holonomy, taken over all trajectories.

Since there is a good general abstract theory of higher gauge fields and their higher holonomies (see [[differential cohomology]] and [[cohesive (infinity,1)-topos|differential cohomology in a cohesive topos]]), this suggests that there should be a general abstract theory of $\sigma$-models. Aspects of this are discussed [below](Exposition).

### The relativistic $(n-1)$-brane
 {#RelativisticNBrane}

It is hard not to consider the following generalization of the relativistic particle $\sigma$-model, that we discussed [above](#RelativisticParticle):

notice that nothing in the structure of the relativistic particle's [[action functional]] (eq:ParticleActionForGlobalA) relies on the [[dimension]] of $\Sigma$ being $1$. Instead, it is just the degree-1 case of the following family of types of classical $\sigma$-models, that make sense for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$:

* let $\Sigma$ be of [[dimension]] $n$;

* let [[target space]] be a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]] $(X,g)$ as before;

* let the [[background gauge field]] be given by a smooth [[differential form|differential n-form]] $A \in \Omega^n(X)$.

* let [[configuration space]] be the [[action groupoid|weak quotient]]

  $$
    Conf_\Sigma := C^\infty(\Sigma, X)//Diff(\Sigma)   
    \,.
  $$

* let then finally the [[action functional]] be given by

  $$
    S([\gamma]) = \int_\Sigma dvol(\gamma^* g) + \int_\Sigma \gamma^* A
    \,.
  $$

This is the same formula as for the relativistic particle as before, only that now the differential forms are taken to be of degree $n$ and integrals to be over $n$-dimensional spaces.

Moreover, for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ there is an analog of the generalization 

$$
  \{1-forms\} \hookrightarrow \{circle bundles with connection\}
$$

to the generalization

$$
  \{n-forms\} \hookrightarrow \{circle n-bundles with connection\}
  \,.
$$

Given any [[circle n-bundle with connection]] $\nabla$ and closed $\Sigma$ of dimension $n$, there is a [[higher parallel transport|higher]] [[holonomy]] [[functional]]

$$
  hol(\nabla, -) : (\Sigma \stackrel{\gamma}{\to} X) \mapsto 
  hol(\nabla, \gamma) \in U(1)
$$

that extends the functional $A \mapsto \exp(i \int_\Sigma \gamma^* A)$.

Therefore, generally, we may take for $n \in \mathbb{N}$

* the [[background gauge field]] on $X$ is a [[circle n-bundle with connection]] $\nabla$;

* the exponentiated [[action functional]] is 

  $$
    [\gamma] \mapsto \exp(i \int_\Sigma dvol(\gamma^* )) \;\;\; hol(\nabla,\gamma)
   \,.
  $$


For $n = 3$ such a $\sigma$-model describes an analog of a relativistic particle which is not pointlike, but 2-dimensional (with 3-dimensional trajectory) hence which reminds one of a [[membrane]]. Inspired by this term, the general case has come to be known as the _relativistic $(n-1)$-[[brane]]_ . 

The case $n = 2$ is called the relativistic [[string]], which we consider in more detail [below](#RelativisticString). This has received a lot of attention (in _[[string theory]]_ ) not just because it is the next simplest in an infinite hierarchy of cases, but also because its quantum theory turns out to have various interesting features that seem to make it special. Moreover, many of the $(n-1)$-branes for other $n$ re-appear in one way or other in the study of the string (as its boundary [[D-brane]]s in all dimensions $0 \leq n \leq 10$, as its "strongly coupled" version: the [[M-theory membrane]], or as its [[electric-magnetic duality|electric-magnetic dual]]: the [[NS5-brane]]). If nothing else, the seemingly innocent step from $n = 1$ to $n = 2$ in the $\sigma$-model shows that there is a rich pattern of higher dimensional ($\sigma$-model) quantum field theories that are all interrelated in intricate ways.

Another important special case for the general discussion of $\sigma$-models is the case of the [[membrane]], $n = 3$, for which the [[background gauge field]] is a _[[Chern-Simons circle 3-bundle]]_ for some $G$-[[principal bundle]] on $X$, for $G$ some suitable [[Lie group]]. In this case the gauge-coupling [[Lagrangian]] of the $\sigma$-model is, locally, the [[Chern-Simons form]] $CS(\nabla_\mathfrak{g})$ of a $G$-[[connection on a bundle|connection]] $\nabla_{\mathfrak{g}}$, hence the [[action functional]] is (locally) the [[Chern-Simons theory|Chern-Simons functional]]

$$
  (\Sigma \stackrel{\gamma}{\to} X) \mapsto \int_\Sigma CS(\gamma^* \nabla_\mathfrak{g})
  \,.
$$

Below we will see that when $\sigma$-models are considered [[internalization|internal to]] a suitable [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]], then there are _universal_ $\sigma$-models of this Chern-Simons type, whose [[target space]] is no longer a [[smooth manifold]], but a [[smooth ∞-groupoid]] incarnation of a [[classifying space]] $B G$. 


### The relativistic string
 {#RelativisticString}


The local 2-form of the [[background gauge field]] for the string is traditionally denoted $B \in \Omega^2(X)$ and called the [[B-field]]. It 3-form [[curvature]] [[field strength]] is traditionally denoted $H := d B$.

With $T \in \mathbb{R}$ a freely specifyable parameter that plays a role analogous to the mass _and_ the charge of the relativistic particle, the [[action functional]] for the [[string]]'s $\sigma$-model is

$$
  [\gamma] \mapsto T \int_\Sigma dvol(\gamma^* g) + T \int_\Sigma \gamma^* B
  \,.
$$

To gain insight into the physical meaning of this, we consider the
critical locus of this for the simple case that [[target space]] $(X,g)$ is [[Minkowski spacetime]] and $\Sigma = \mathbb{R}^2$. With $(\tau,\sigma)$ the two canonical [[coordinate]]s on $\Sigma$, we still write 

$$
  \dot \gamma := \partial_\tau \gamma
$$

but now also have the derivative $\partial_\sigma \gamma$ which we may think of as being _tangential to the string_ at any instant of its trajectory.

The critical trajectories $\gamma : \Sigma \to X$ are those that satisfy the [[wave equation]]

$$
  g(\ddot \gamma,-)  - g(\partial_\sigma^2 \gamma,-)
  = 
  H(\dot \gamma, \partial_\sigma \gamma,-)
$$

on the [[worldsheet]]. Comparison with the equation of motion of the  [relativistic particle](#RelativisticParticle) shows that $H(\partial_\sigma \gamma, -,-)$ plays the role of a [[field strength]] 2-form. Hence the string behaves as if electric [[charge]] is spread out evenly along it. In the _point particle limit_ where the string has no extension in that $\partial_\sigma \gamma = 0$, the above equation reduces again to free Newtonian motion

$$
  \ddot \gamma = \vec a = 0
  \,.
$$



* [[string]]

* [[wave equation]]

* [[Kalb-Ramond field]], [[B-field]]

* [[orientifold]]

* [[D-brane]]

## Exposition of a general abstract formulation
 {#Exposition}

We give a leisurely exposition of a general abstract formulation $\sigma$-models, aimed at readers with a background in [[category theory]] but trying to assume no other prerequisites.

### Quantum field theory
 {#ExpositionQuantumFieldTheory}

#### Definition

For our purposes here, a [[quantum field theory]] of [[dimension]] $n$ is a [[symmetric monoidal functor]]

$$
  Z : Bord_n^S \to \mathcal{C}
  \,,
$$

where

* $Bord_n^S$ is a [[cobordism category|category of n-dimensional cobordisms]] that are equipped with some [[structure]] $S$; 

  * its [[object]]s are $(n-1)$-[[dimension]]al [[topological manifold]]s;

  * its [[morphism]]s are [[isomorphism class]]es of $n$-[[dimension]]al [[cobordism]]s between such manifolds

  * and all manifolds are equipped with _$S$-[[structure]]_ . For instance $S$ could be _[[Riemannian structure]]_ . Then we would call $Z$ a [[Euclidean quantum field theory]] (confusingly). If $S$ is "no structure" then we call $Z$ a [[topological quantum field theory]].

  * the [[monoidal category]]-structure is given by [[disjoint union]] of manifolds

    $$
      \Sigma_1 \otimes \Sigma_2 := \Sigma_1 \coprod \Sigma_2    
      \,;
    $$

* $\mathcal{C}$ is some [[symmetric monoidal category]].

We think of data as follows:

* $Bord_n^S$ is a model for _being_ and _becoming_ in [[physics]] (following [[Bill Lawvere]]'s terminology): the objects of $Bord_n^S$ are archetypes of _physical spaces that are_ and the morphisms are _physical spaces that evolve_ ;

* the [[object]] $Z(\Sigma)$ that $Z$ assigns to any $(n-1)$-manifold $\Sigma$ is to be thought of as the _[[space]] of all possible [[state]]s_ over the space $\Sigma$ of a the physical system to be modeled;

* so $\mathcal{C}$ is the category of [[n-vector space]]s among which the _spaces of [[state]]s_ of the quantum theory can be picked;

* the [[morphism]] $Z(\hat \Sigma) : Z(\Sigma_{in}) \to Z(\Sigma_{out})$ that $\Sigma$ assigns to any [[cobordism]] $\hat \Sigma$ with incoming [[boundary]] $\Sigma_{in}$ and outgoing boundary $\Sigma_{out}$ is the [[propagator]] along $\hat \Sigma$: it maps every state $\psi \in Z(\Sigma_{in})$ of the system over $\Sigma_{in}$ to the state $Z(\Psi) \in \Sigma_{out}$ that is the result of the evolution of $\psi$ along $\hat \Sigma$ by the _dynamics_ of the system. Or conversely: the action of $Z$ encodes what this dynamics is supposed to be.

Notice that since $Z$ is required to be a symmetric monoidal functor it sends disjoint unions of manifolds to [[tensor product]]s

$$
  F(\Sigma_1 \coprod \Sigma_2) \simeq Z(\Sigma_1) \otimes Z(\Sigma_2)
  \,.
$$

Moreover, for $\hat \Sigma$ a closed [[cobordism]], hence a morphism $\emptyset \stackrel{\hat \Sigma}{\to} \emptyset$ from the [[empty set|empty]] manifold to itself, we have that

* $Z(\emptyset) = \mathbf{1}$ is the tensor unit of $\mathcal{C}$;

* $Z(\hat \Sigma)  \in End(\mathbb{1})$ is an [[endomorphism]] of this tensor unit, a _number_ as seen internal to $\mathcal{C}$ -- this is the _invariant_ associated to $\hat \Sigma$ by $Z$, called the [[partition function]] of $Z$ over $\hat \Sigma$. We can think of $Z$ as being a rule for computing such invariants by building them up from smaller pieces. This is the _locaity_ of quantum field theory.

#### Examples
 {#ExpositionQFTExamples}

* A simple but archetypical example is this: let $S := Riem$ be [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian structure]]. Then the category $Bord_1^{Riem}$ of 1-dimensional cobordisms equipped with Riemannian structure is generated (as a [[symmetric monoidal category]]) from [[interval]]s 

  $$
    \bullet \stackrel{t}{\to} \bullet
  $$

  equipped with a [[length]] $t \in \mathbb{R}_+$. Composition is given by addition of lengths

  $$
    (\bullet \stackrel{t_1}{\to} \bullet \stackrel{t_2}{\to})
    = 
    (\bullet \stackrel{t_1 + t_2}{\to} \bullet)
    \,.
  $$

  Therefore a 1-dimensional [[Euclidean quantum field theory]]

  $$
    Z : Bord_1^{Riem} \to Vect
  $$

  is specified by
  
  * a [[vector space]] $\mathcal{H}$ ("of [[state]]s") assigned to the point;

  * for each $t \in \mathbb{R}_+$ a linear endomorphism

    $$
      U(t) : \mathcal{H} \to \mathcal{H}
    $$

    such that 

    $$  
      U(t_1 + t_2) = U(t_2) \circ U(t_1)
      \,.
    $$

  This is just a system of [[quantum mechanics]]. If we demand that $Z$ respects the [[smooth structure]] on the space of morphisms in $Bord_1^{Riem}$ then there will be a linear map $i H : \mathcal{H} \to \mathcal{H}$ such that

   $$
     U(t) = \exp(i H t)
     \,.
   $$

   This $H$ is called the [[Hamilton operator]] of the system.
   
   (We are glossing here over some technical fine print in the definition of $Bord_1^{Riem}$. Done right we have that $\mathcal{H}$ may indeed be an infinite-dimensional vector space. See [[(1,1)-dimensional Euclidean field theories and K-theory]])

### Classical field theory
 {#ExpositionClassicalFieldTheory}

A special class of examples of $n$-dimensional quantum field theories, as discussed [above](#ExpositionQuantumFieldTheory), arise as [[deformation quantization|deformations]] or _[[path integral|averages]]_ of similar, but simpler structure: _[[classical field theories]]_ . The process that constructs a quantum field theory out of a classical field theory is called _[[quantization]]_ . This is discussed [below](#ExpositionQuantization). Here we describe what a classical field theory is. We shall inevitably oversimplify the situation such as to still count as a leisurely exposition. The kind of examples that the following discussion applies to strictly are field theories <a href="http://nlab.mathforge.org/schreiber/show/infinity-Chern-Simons+theory#DiscreteTargets">of Dijkgraaf-Witten type</a>. But despite its simplicity, this case accurately reflects most of the general abstract properties of the general theory.

For our purposes here, a [[classical field theory]] of dimension $n$ is

* a [[symmetric monoidal functor]]

  $$
    \exp(i S(-)) : Bord_n^S \to Span(Grpd, \mathcal{C})
    \,,
  $$

  where

  * $Bord_n^S$ is the same [[category of cobordisms]] as before;

  * $Span(Grpd, \mathcal{C})$ is the [[category of spans]] of [[groupoid]]s over $\mathcal{C}$:

    * [[object]]s are [[groupoid]]s $K$ equipped with [[functor]]s $\phi : K \to \mathcal{C}$;

    * [[morphism]]s $(K_1, \phi_1) \to (K_2, \phi_2)$ are [[diagram]]s

      $$
        \array{
           && \hat K
           \\
           & \swarrow && \searrow
           \\
           K_1 &&\swArrow&& K_2
           \\
           & \searrow && \swarrow
           \\
           && \mathcal{C}
        }
        \,,
      $$

      where in the middle we have a [[natural transformation]];

    * [[composition]] of morphism is by forming [[2-pullback]]s:

      $$
        (\hat K_2 \circ \hat K_1) = \hat K_1 \prod_{K_2} \hat K_2
        \,.
      $$


Let $\hat \Sigma : \Sigma_1 \to \Sigma_2$ be a [[cobordism]] and

$$
  \exp(i S(-))_{\Sigma} =
  \left(
        \array{
           && Conf_{\hat \Sigma}
           \\
           & {}^{\mathllap{(-)|_{in}}}\swarrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{(-)|_{out}}}
           \\
           Conf_{\Sigma_1} &&\swArrow_{\exp(i S(-)_{\hat \Sigma})}&& Conf_{\Sigma_2}
           \\
           & {}_{V_{\Sigma_1}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{V_{\Sigma_2}}}
           \\
           && \mathcal{C}
        }
  \right)
$$

the value of a classical field theory on $\hat \Sigma$.
We interpret this data as follows:

* $Conf_{\Sigma_1}$ is the [[configuration space]] of a [[classical field theory]] over $\Sigma_1$: [[object]]s are "field configurations" on $\Sigma_1$ and [[morphism]]s are [[gauge transformation]]s between these. Similarly for $Conf_{\Sigma_2}$.

  Here a "physical field" can be something like the [[electromagnetic field]]. But it can also be something very different. For the special case of $\sigma$-models that we are eventually getting at, a "field configuration" here will instead be a way of an particle of shape $\Sigma_1$ sitting in some [[target space]].

* $Conf_{\hat \Sigma}$ is similarly the groupoid of field configurations on the whole cobordism, $\hat \Sigma$. If we think of an object in $Conf_{\hat \Sigma}$ of a way of a [[brane]] of shape $\Sigma_1$ sitting in some [[target space]], then an object in $Conf_{\hat Sigma}$ is a _trajectory_ of that brane in that target space, along which it evolves from shape $\Sigma_1$ to shape $\Sigma_2$.

* $V_{\Sigma_i} : Conf_{\Sigma_i} \to \mathcal{C}$ is the [[classifying space|classifying map]] of a kind of [[vector bundle]] over configuration space: a [[state]] $\psi \in Z(\Sigma_1)$ of the [[quantum field theory]] that will be associated to this [[classical field theory]] by [[quantization]] will be a [[section]] of this vector bundle. Such a section is to be thought of as a generalization of a 
[[probability distribution]] on the space of classical field configurations. The [[generalized element]]s of a [[fiber]] $V_{c}$ of $V_{\Sigma_1}$ over a configuration $c \in Conf_{\Sigma_1}$ may be thought of as an _internal state_ of the brane of shape $\Sigma_1$ sitting in target space. 

* $\exp(i S(-))_{\hat \Sigma}$ is the [[action functional]] that defines the classical field theory: the component

  $$
   \exp(i S(\gamma))_{\hat \Sigma} 
    : 
    V_{\gamma|_{in}}
    \to
    V_{\gamma|_{out}}
  $$

 of this [[natural transformation]] on a trajectory $\gamma \in Conf_{\hat \Sigma}$ going from a configuration $\gamma|_{in}$ to a configuration $\gamma|_{out}$ is a morphism in $\mathcal{C}$ that maps the internal states of the ingoing configuration $\gamma|_{\Sigma_1}$ to the internal states of the outgoing configuration $\gamma|_{\Sigma_2}$. This evolution of internal states encodes the _classical dynamics_ of the system.
 
Notice that this way a classical field theory is taken to be a special case of a [quantum field theory](#ExpositionQuantumFieldTheory), where the codomain of the symmetric monoidal functor is of the special form $Span(Grpd, \mathcal{C})$. For more on this see [[classical field theory as quantum field theory]].

### Quantization
 {#ExpositionQuantization}

We assume now that $\mathcal{C}$ has [[colimit]]s and in fact [[biproduct]]s.

Then for every [[functor]] $\phi : K \to \mathcal{C}$ the [[colimit]] 

$$
  \int^{K} \phi \in \mathcal{C}
$$

exists, and (using the existence of [[biproduct]]s) this construction extends to a [[functor]]

$$
  \int : Span(Grpd, \mathcal{C}) \to \mathcal{C}
  \,.
$$

We call this the _[[path integral]]_ functor.

For

$$
  \exp(i S(-)) : Bord_n^S \to Span(Grpd, \mathcal{C})
$$

a [classical field theory](#ExpositionClassicalFieldTheory), we get this way a [quantum field theory](#ExpositionQuantumFieldTheory) by forming the composite functor

$$
  Z 
    := 
  \int \circ \exp(i S(-)) 
   : 
  Bord_n^S 
    \stackrel{\exp(i S(-))}{\to}
  Span(Grpd, \mathcal{C})
    \stackrel{\int}{\to}
  \mathcal{C}
  \,.
$$

This $Z$ we call the _[[quantization]]_ of $\exp(i S(-))$.

It acts

* on [[object]]s by sending

  $$
    \begin{aligned}
      \Sigma_{in} & \mapsto (V_{\Sigma_{in}} : Conf_{\Sigma_{in}} \to \mathcal{C}) 
      \\
      & \mapsto \mathcal{H}_{\Sigma_{in}} := \int^K V_{\Sigma_{in}}
    \end{aligned}
  $$

  the vector bundle on the [[configuration space]] over some boundary $\Sigma_{in}$ of [[worldvolume]] to its space $\mathcal{H}_{\Sigma_{in}}$ of [[gauge transformation|gauge invariant]] [[section]]s. In typical situations this $\mathcal{H}_{\Sigma_{in}}$ is the famous [[Hilbert space]] of [[state]]s in [[quantum mechanics]], only that here it is allowed to be any object in $\mathcal{C}$;

* on [[morphism]]s by sending a [[natural transformation]]

  $$
    \begin{aligned}   
      \hat \Sigma & \mapsto 
       (\exp(i S(-))_{\hat \Sigma} : \gamma \mapsto 
       V_{\gamma|_{in}} \to V_{\gamma|_{out}})
       \\   
       & \mapsto
       (\int^K \exp(i S(-))_{\hat \Sigma} 
        : 
        \mathcal{H}_{\Sigma_1} \to \mathcal{H}_{\Sigma_2}
       )
    \end{aligned}
  $$

  to the [[integral transform]] that it defines, weighted by the [[groupoid cardinality]] of $Conf_{\hat \Sigma}$ : the _[[path integral]]_ .


### Classical $\sigma$-models
 {#ExpositionClassicalSigmaModels}


A _classical $\sigma$-model_ is a [classical field theory](#ExpositionClassicalFieldTheory) such that

* the [[configuration space]]s $Conf_{\Sigma}$ are [[mapping spaces]] $\mathbf{H}(\Sigma,X)$ in some suitable category -- some [[cohesive (infinity,1)-topos|higher topos]] in fact -- , for $X$ some fixed [[object]] of that category called _[[target space]]_ ;
 
* the bundles $V_{\Sigma} : Conf_{\Sigma} \to \mathcal{C}$ "of internal states" over these mapping spaces are 

  * the [[transgression]] to these [[mapping space]]s...

  * ...of an [[associated infinity-bundle|associated higher bundle]]... 

  * ...asscociated to a [[circle n-bundle with connection]] on [[target space]]...

  * ...encoded by a classifying morphism

    $$
      \alpha : X \to \mathbf{B}^{n} U(1)
    $$

    into the [[circle n-group]] in $\mathbf{H}$; equipped with an [[connection on an infinity-bundle|n-connection]] $\nabla$...

  * ...where the [[associated bundle|association]] is via a [[representation]]

    $$
      \rho : \mathbf{B}^{n+1} U(1) \to (n+1) Vect
    $$

    on [[n-vector spaces]], which is usually taken to be the canonical 1-dimensional one.

  One calls $(\alpha,\nabla)$ the [[background gauge field]] of the $\sigma$-model.

* The [[action functional]]s $\exp(i S(-))_{\hat \Sigma}$ are given by the [[higher parallel transport]] of $\nabla$ over $\hat \Sigma$.

So an $n$-dimensional $\sigma$-model is a classical field theory that is [[representable functor|represented]], in a sense, by a [[circle n-bundle with connection]] on some [[target space]].

More specifically and more simply, in cases where $X$ is just a [[discrete ∞-groupoid]]  -- the case of  <a href="http://nlab.mathforge.org/schreiber/show/infinity-Chern-Simons%20theory#DiscreteTargets">sigma-models of Dijkgraaf-Witten type</a>, every [[principal ∞-bundle]] on $X$ is necessarily <a href="http://nlab.mathforge.org/nlab/show/cohesive+%28infinity%2C1%29-topos%20--%20structures#FlatDifferentialCohomology">flat</a>, hence the [[background gauge field]] is given just by the morphism

$$
  \alpha : X \to \mathbf{B}^{n} U(1)
  \,.
$$

Then for $\hat \Sigma$ a closed $n$-dimensional manifold, the [[action functional]] of the sigma-model on $\Sigma$ on a field configuration $\gamma : \hat \Sigma \to X$ has the value

$$
  \exp(i S(\gamma))_{\hat \Sigma}
  = 
  \int_{\hat \Sigma} [\alpha]
$$

being the evaluation of $[\alpha]$ regarded as a class in [[ordinary cohomology]] $H^n(\hat \Sigma, U(1))$ evaluated on the [[fundamental class]] of $X$. 

One says that $[\alpha]$ is the [[Lagrangian]] of the theory.


### Quantum $\sigma$-models
 {#ExpositionQuantumSigmaModels} 

(...)

## Examples 

### Non-topological $\sigma$-models 

* The canonical textbook example of a quantum mechanical system is of this form for $n=1$: A line [[vector bundle|bundle]] with [[connection on a bundle|connection]] $E \to X$ on a ([[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo-]])[[Riemannian manifold]] $X$ induces the 1-dimensional [[quantum field theory]] which is the quantum mechanics of a point particle which propagates on $X$, subject to the forces of [[gravity]] (given by the [[pseudo-Riemannian metric]] on $X$) and [[electromagnetism]] (given by the line bundle with connection). The [[Hamilton operator]] encoding this quantum dynamics in this case is the Laplace-operator of $T X$ twisted by the line bundle $E$.

  For $X$ a [[spacetime]] this is called the [[relativistic particle]].

  For $\Sigma$ or $X$ a [[supermanifold]] this is the [[superparticle]].

* Generalizing in the above example the line bundle $E$ by an abelian [[bundle gerbe]] with a connection yields a background for a 2-dimensional $\sigma$-model which mayb be thought of as describing the propgation of a [[string theory|string]].  The best-studied version of this is the case where $X = G$ is a [[Lie group]], in which case this $\sigma$-model is known as the _[[WZW model|Wess--Zumino--Witten model]]_.



### Topological $\sigma$-models 


* [[Dijkgraaf-Witten theory]] is the (2+1)-dimensioanl $\sigma$-model induced from an abelian 2-gerbe on $\mathbf{B} G$, for $G$ a finite group.

* [[Chern-Simons theory]] is supposed to be analogously the $\sigma$-model induced from an abelian 2-gerbe with connection on $\mathbf{B}G$, but now for $G$ a Lie group.

* the [[Poisson sigma-model]] is a model whose target is a [[Poisson Lie algebroid]].

* in [[AKSZ theory]] this is generalized to a large class of sigma models with [[symplectic Lie n-algebroid]]s as target.

* Rozansky--Witten theory is essentially the $\sigma$-model for $X$ a smooth projective variety.

* generally [[schreiber:∞-Chern-Simons theory]] is a $\sigma$-model with a [[smooth ∞-groupoid]] of [[connection on an ∞-bundle|∞-connections]].
