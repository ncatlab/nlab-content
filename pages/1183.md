## Idea

A _$\sigma$-model_ is a [[quantum field theory]]  whose fields are maps from a _[[worldvolume]]_ $\Sigma$ into some _[[target space]]_ that carries some geometric structure -- usually a [[background gauge field]] given by a [[connection on an infinity-bundle]] generally or a cocycle in abelian [[differential cohomology]] more specifically.

One way to make this precise for _topological_ $\sigma$-models is to say that target space $X$, or possibly the gauge bundle $P \to X$ over it, [[representable functor|represents]] an functor that sends [[cobordism]] [[cospan]]s to [[span]]s which in turn are taken to act by pull-push on the quantum states, which are objects in [[geometric infinity-function theory]] living over the mapping spaces $[\Sigma, P]$. (...)

### Physical interpretation 

$\sigma$-model quantum field theories on [[worldvolume]] $\Sigma$ of top dimension $n+1$ are to be thought of as encoding the quantum mechanics of the propagation of an $n$-dimensional particle, called an _$(n-1)$-[[brane]]_, in [[target space]] $X$, subject to [[force]]s imposed on it by the [[background gauge field]], under which it is said to be _[[charge]]d_.

These cases describe non-topological quantum field theories. Here the formalization of the notion of $\sigma$-model is not entirely complete. Yet.

### Terminology and history
 {#TerminologyAndHistory}

In physics one tends to speak of a _model_ if one specifies a particular [[quantum field theory]] for describing a particular situation, for instance by specifying a [[Lagrangian]] or [[local action functional]] on some [[configuration space]]. This is traditionally not meant in the mathematical sense of _[[model]]_ of some [[theory]]. But in light of progress of mathematically formalizing [[quantum field theory]] (see [[FQFT]] and [[AQFT]]), it can with hindsight be interpreted in this way: 

a $\sigma$-model is supposed to be a type of [[model]] for the [[theory]] called [[quantum field theory]]. This sounds like a tautology, but much effort in mathematical physics is devoted to eventually making this a precise statement. In special cases and toy examples this has been achieved, but for the examples that seem to be directly relevant for the phenomenological description of the observed world, lots of clues still seem to be missing.

As to the "$\sigma$" in "$\sigma$-model": back in the 1960s people were interested in a hypothetical particle called the 
$\sigma$-particle.  [[Murray Gell-Mann]] came up with a theory of them.  It was called ‘the $\sigma$-model’.  It was an old-fashioned field theory where the field took values in a vector space.   Then someone came up with a modified version of the σ-model where the field took values in some other [[manifold]] and this was called ‘the nonlinear σ-model’.  

While the parameter space (the domain space of the fields) of the original $\sigma$-models was supposed to be our [[spacetime]] and the target space was some abstract space, with the advent of [[string theory]] the nonlinear $\sigma$-models gained importance as quantum field theories whose _target space_ is [[spacetime]] $X$ and whose parameter space is some low dimensional space, usually denoted $\Sigma$. A field configuration $\Sigma \to X$ is then interpreted as being the trajectory of an extended fundamental particle -- a fundamental [[brane]] -- in $X$, and the $\sigma$-model describes the quantum mechanics of that brane propagating in $X$.

In particular the [[quantum mechanics]] of a [[relativistic particle]] propagating on $X$ is described by a $\sigma$-model on the [[real line]] $\Sigma = \mathbb{R}$ -- the _worldline_ of the particle.

In [[string theory]] one considers 2-[[dimension]]al $\Sigma$ and thinks of maps $\Sigma \to X$ as being the _worldsheets_ of the trajectory of a string propagating in spacetime.

In the context of [[11-dimensional supergravity]] there is a $\sigma$-model with 3-dimensional $\Sigma$, describing the propagation of a [[membrane]] in [[spacetime]].

## Exposition of classical sigma-models
 {#ExpositionClassical}

We survey, starting from the very basics, [[classical field theory]] aspects of $\sigma$-models that describe dynamics of [[particle]]s, [[strings]]s and [[brane]]s on geometric [[target space]]s.

### The Newtonian particle
 {#ExpositionNewtonianParticle}

With hindsight, the earliest $\sigma$-model ever considered was also the very origin of the science of [[physics]]:

In order to describe the motion of matter [[particles]] in [[space]], [[Isaac Newton]] wrote down a [[differential equation]] with the famous symbols

$$
  \vec F = m \vec a 
  \,.
$$

More in detail, this is meant to describe the following situation:

* write $X := \mathbb{R}^3$ for the [[Cartesian space]] of [[dimension]] 3; think of this as a model for physics space;

* write $\Sigma := \mathbb{R}$ for the [[Cartesian space]] of [[dimensional]] 1; think of this as the abstract trajectory of a point particle;

* write $\gamma : \Sigma \to X$ for a [[smooth function]]; think of this as an actual trajectory of a point particle in $X$;

  write furthermore

  * $\vec v := \dot \gamma \in Hom(T \Sigma, T X)$ for the [[derivative]] of $\gamma$; think of this as the [[velocity]] of the particle; and

  * $\vec a := \ddot \gamma$ for the second [[derivative]], the [[acceleration]] of the particle.

We call then the collection of all [[smooth function]]s

$$
  Conf := C^\infty(\Sigma, X)
$$

the [[configuration space]] of a physical model of a point particle propagating on $X$. 


In order to define the model -- the model of some physical situation -- 

* pick a [[vector field]] $\vec F \in \Gamma(T X)$ on $X$. Think of this as expressing at each point a [[force]] acting on the particle with trajectory.

  For instance $\vec F := q \vec E$ could be an [[electromagnetic field|electric field]] $\vec E$ influencing the propagation of an electrically charged particle of [[charge]] $q$.

In modern language we may say:

* $\Sigma$ is the [[worldline]] of the particle;

* $X$ is the [[target space]] (expressing the fact that it is the [[codomain]] of a function $\gamma : \Sigma \to X$)

* $\vec F$ is the [[background gauge field]];

and the collection $(\Sigma, X, \vec F)$ of all three is a _$\sigma$-model_ . 

Given this data, the space of solutions to the original [[differential equation]]

$$
  P := \{ \gamma \in Conf | \forall t \in \mathbb{R} : \vec F_{\gamma(t)} = m \vec a(t) \}
$$

is called the [[covariant phase space]] of the model. The configurations in $P \subset Conf$ have the interpretation of being those potential configurations, that describe actual trajectories of [[particle]]s observed in nature.

Notice that in the case of vanishing [[force]] field $\vec F = 0$, the [[equations of motion]] of the [Newtonian particle](#ExpositionNewtonianParticle)

$$
  \vec a = 0
$$

may be read as characterizing precisely the [[geodesic]]s in $\mathbb{R}^3$ regarded as a [[Riemannian manifold]] using the canonical [[metric]]. This is a special and limiting case of the [relativistic particle](#RelativisticParticle) discussed below.

A cautionary note is in order. While the Newtonian particle may serve as an introductory example for motivating the concept of $\sigma$-models, it in general lacks some of the nice properties that later on we shall take to be characteristic of $\sigma$-models. Mainly this is due to the fact that the Newtonian particle is but a limiting approximation to the [[relativistic particle]] to which we turn next.


### The relativistic particle
 {#RelativisticParticle}


The Newtonian particle propagating on $\mathbb{R}^3$, discussed [above](#ExpositionNewtonianParticle) is a special and limiting case of a particle propagating on a 4-dimensional [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]: [[spacetime]]. For historical reasons (the same that led to the theory of [[gravity]] being called a theory of [[general relativity|relativity]]) this is called the [[relativistic particle]].

The $\sigma$-model describing the relativistic particle is the following.

* [[target space|Target space]] is a  [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]] $(X,g)$, thought of as [[spacetime]].

* Parameter space $\Sigma = \mathbb{R}$ is the [[real line]], thought of as the abstract [[worldline]] of a [[relavistic particle]].

* The [[background gauge field]] is given by a smooth [[differential form|1-form]] $A \in \Omega^1(X)$, whose [[exterior derivative]] $F := d A$ is the [[field strength]] of an [[electromagnetic field]]. 

The [[configuration space]] is the [[quotient]]

$$
  Conf = C^\infty(\mathbb{R}, X)//Diff(\mathbb{R})
  \,,
$$

of [[smooth function]]s $\Sigma \to X$ by [[diffeomorphism]]s $\Sigma \to \Sigma$. Each point in cofiguration space is a trajectory of a particle in spacetime.

The [[covariant phase space]] -- the subspace of the configuration space of those configurations that satisfy the [[equations of motion]] -- is defined to be

$$
  P =
  \{ [\gamma] \in Conf
   |
  g(\nabla_{\dot \gamma} \dot \gamma,-) =  \frac{q}{m}\iota_{\dot \gamma} F
  \}
  \subset Conf
  \,,
$$

where 

* $\nabla$ denotes the [[covariant derivative]] of the [[Levi-Civita connection]] of the background metric $g$ on the [[tangent bundle]] $T X$ of $X$Here in the equation of motion;

* $g(\nabla_{\dot \gamma} \dot \gamma,-)$ is the 1-form given by evaluating the covariant acceleration in the metric tensor;

* $\frac{q}{m}\iota_{\dot \gamma} F$ is the 1-form given by evaluation the [[field strength]] 2-form on the covariant velocity,

  (This is the [[Lorentz force]] excerted by the background electromagnetic field on the relativistic particle of charge $q$);

* the equation is taken to holt in each [[cotangent space]] $T^*_{\gamma(\tau)} X$ for each $\tau \in \mathbb{R}$.

To see what this means, consider some special cases. First regard the case that the background field strenght vanishes, $F = 0$. Then the equations of motion reduce to

$$
  \nabla_{\dot \gamma} \dot \gamma = 0 
  \,.
$$

This says that the trajectory $\gamma$ exhibits [[parallel transport]] of its tangent vectors (their covariant velocities) with respect to the [[Levi-Civita connection]] of the background metric.

In the even more special case that $X$ is [[Minkowski spacetime]], where we may find a global [[coordinate chart]] $(\mathbb{R}^4, \eta) \simeq (X,g)$, this are exactly the straight lines in $\mathbb{R}^4$. Given any such, there is precisely one representative in the diffeomorphism class for which $\mathbb{R} \stackrel{\gamma}{\to} \mathbb{R}^4 \stackrel{x^0}{\to} \mathbb{R}$ is the identity, hence for which the [[worldline]] parameter coincides precisely with the chosen global time coordinate $t := x^0$ on $\mathbb{R}^4$. For those the equations of motions are again those of the free Newtonian particle $\vec a = 0$.

Remaining in the case that $X$ is [[Minkowski space]] but allowing now a nontrivial background field, notice that we may write the 2-form $F$ always as

$$
  F = \vec E_i \cdot d x^i \wedge d t + \vec B_i \epsilon_{i j k} d x^j \edge d x^j
  \,,
$$

where $\vec E \in \mathbb{R}^3$ is the electric field strength vector and $\vec B \in \mathbb{R}^3$ the magnetic field strength vector. The spatial part of the above equations of motion are in this case again as for a Newtonian particle

$$
  m \vec a = q \vec E + q \vec v \times \vec B
  \,,
$$

where in the second term we have the [[cross product]] of vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$. This is the form in which the [[Lorentz force]] law appears in many textbooks.

Notice that the equations of motion imply, generally, that the [[norm]] of $\dot \gamma$ is constant along the trajectory

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \frac{d}{d \tau} g(\dot \gamma, \dot \gamma)
    &= 2 g(\nabla_{\dot \gamma} \dot \gamma, \dot \gamma)
    \\
    & = 
    2 g(g^{-1}(\iota_{\dot \gamma} F, -), \dot \gamma)
    \\
    & \propto F(\dot \gamma, \dot \gamma)
    \\
    & = 
    0
  \end{aligned}
   \,.
$$

Therefore a trajectory that solves the equations of motion and whose tangent vector is [[timelike]] or [[spacelike]] or [[lightlike]], respectively at any instant is so throughout.


The points in the [[covariant phase space]]

$$
  P = \{ [\gamma] \in Conf | 
   g(\nabla_{\dot \gamma} \dot \gamma,-) =  \frac{q}{m}\iota_{\dot \gamma} F
    \}
  \subset Conf 
$$

happen to be the local critical points of the [[functional]]

$$
  S : Cont \to \mathbb{R}
$$

given by

$$
  S([\gamma]) 
   := 
  m \int_\Sigma dvol(\gamma^*g)  + q \int_\Sigma \gamma^* A
  \,.
$$

This is the [[action functional]] of the relativistic particle $\sigma$-model. The first summan is called the _kinetic action_ , the second is calle the _gauge coupling_  action. Typically one characterizes the models in terms of such action functionals, from which the [[covariant phase space]] then derives. This typically yields a simpler and deeper description of the model. 

For instance for the above action functional has an evident generalization to the case where the background [[electromagnetic field]] is not given by a globally defined 1-form, but more generally by a [[circle n-bundle with connection|cicle bundle with connection]] $\nabla$: if we pass to the exponentiated action

$$
  \exp(i S(\gamma)) = 
  \exp(i \int_\Sigma dvol(\gamma^*g) ) 
  \exp(i q \int_\Sigma \gamma^* A)
$$

the second factor is evidently the [[holonomy]] of the connection over the worldline. Hence for general electromagnetic background gauge fields the action functional is (assuming for simplicity now closed curves with $\Sigma = S^1$)

$$
  \exp(i S(\gamma))   
  = 
  \exp(i \int_\Sigma dvol(\gamma^*g) ) 
  hol(\nabla, \gamma)
  \,.
$$

## Exposition of a general abstract formulation
 {#Exposition}

We give a leisurely exposition of a general abstract formulation $\sigma$-models, aimed at readers with a background in [[category theory]] but trying to assume no other prerequisites.

What is called an _$n$-dimensional $\sigma$-model_ is first of all an instance of an $n$-dimensional [[quantum field theory]] (to be explained). The distinctive feature of those quantum field theories that are $\sigma$-models is that 

1. these arise from a simpler kind of field theory -- called a [[classical field theory]] -- by a process called [[quantization]] 

1. moreover, this simpler kind of field theory encoded by[[geometry|geometric data]] in a nice way: it describes physical [[configuration space]]s that are [[mapping space]]s into a [[geometry|geometric]] [[space]] equipped with some [[synthetic differential geometry|differential geometric]] [[structure]].

We give expositions of these items step-by-step:

1. [Quantum field theory](#ExpositionQuantumFieldTheory)

1. [Classical field theory](#ExpositionClassicalFieldTheory)

1. [Quantization](#ExpositionQuantization)

1. [Classical sigma-models](#ExpositionClassicalSigmaModels)

1. [Quantum sigma-models](#ExpositionQuantumSigmaModels)

### Quantum field theory
 {#ExpositionQuantumFieldTheory}

#### Definition

For our purposes here, a [[quantum field theory]] of [[dimension]] $n$ is a [[symmetric monoidal functor]]

$$
  Z : Bord_n^S \to \mathcal{C}
  \,,
$$

where

* $Bord_n^S$ is a [[cobordism category|category of n-dimensional cobordisms]] that are equipped with some [[structure]] $S$; 

  * its [[object]]s are $(n-1)$-[[dimension]]al [[topological manifold]]s;

  * its [[morphism]]s are [[isomorphism class]]es of $n$-[[dimension]]al [[cobordism]]s between such manifolds

  * and all manifolds are equipped with _$S$-[[structure]]_ . For instance $S$ could be _[[Riemannian structure]]_ . Then we would call $Z$ a [[Euclidean quantum field theory]] (confusingly). If $S$ is "no structure" then we call $Z$ a [[topological quantum field theory]].

  * the [[monoidal category]]-structure is given by [[disjoint union]] of manifolds

    $$
      \Sigma_1 \otimes \Sigma_2 := \Sigma_1 \coprod \Sigma_2    
      \,;
    $$

* $\mathcal{C}$ is some [[symmetric monoidal category]].

We think of data as follows:

* $Bord_n^S$ is a model for _being_ and _becoming_ in [[physics]] (following [[Bill Lawvere]]'s terminology): the objects of $Bord_n^S$ are archetypes of _physical spaces that are_ and the morphisms are _physical spaces that evolve_ ;

* the [[object]] $Z(\Sigma)$ that $Z$ assigns to any $(n-1)$-manifold $\Sigma$ is to be thought of as the _[[space]] of all possible [[state]]s_ over the space $\Sigma$ of a the physical system to be modeled;

* so $\mathcal{C}$ is the category of [[n-vector space]]s among which the _spaces of [[state]]s_ of the quantum theory can be picked;

* the [[morphism]] $Z(\hat \Sigma) : Z(\Sigma_{in}) \to Z(\Sigma_{out})$ that $\Sigma$ assigns to any [[cobordism]] $\hat \Sigma$ with incoming [[boundary]] $\Sigma_{in}$ and outgoing boundary $\Sigma_{out}$ is the [[propagator]] along $\hat \Sigma$: it maps every state $\psi \in Z(\Sigma_{in})$ of the system over $\Sigma_{in}$ to the state $Z(\Psi) \in \Sigma_{out}$ that is the result of the evolution of $\psi$ along $\hat \Sigma$ by the _dynamics_ of the system. Or conversely: the action of $Z$ encodes what this dynamics is supposed to be.

Notice that since $Z$ is required to be a symmetric monoidal functor it sends disjoint unions of manifolds to [[tensor product]]s

$$
  F(\Sigma_1 \coprod \Sigma_2) \simeq Z(\Sigma_1) \otimes Z(\Sigma_2)
  \,.
$$

Moreover, for $\hat \Sigma$ a closed [[cobordism]], hence a morphism $\emptyset \stackrel{\hat \Sigma}{\to} \emptyset$ from the [[empty set|empty]] manifold to itself, we have that

* $Z(\emptyset) = \mathbf{1}$ is the tensor unit of $\mathcal{C}$;

* $Z(\hat \Sigma)  \in End(\mathbb{1})$ is an [[endomorphism]] of this tensor unit, a _number_ as seen internal to $\mathcal{C}$ -- this is the _invariant_ associated to $\hat \Sigma$ by $Z$, called the [[partition function]] of $Z$ over $\hat \Sigma$. We can think of $Z$ as being a rule for computing such invariants by building them up from smaller pieces. This is the _locaity_ of quantum field theory.

#### Examples
 {#ExpositionQFTExamples}

* A simple but archetypical example is this: let $S := Riem$ be [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian structure]]. Then the category $Bord_1^{Riem}$ of 1-dimensional cobordisms equipped with Riemannian structure is generated (as a [[symmetric monoidal category]]) from [[interval]]s 

  $$
    \bullet \stackrel{t}{\to} \bullet
  $$

  equipped with a [[length]] $t \in \mathbb{R}_+$. Composition is given by addition of lengths

  $$
    (\bullet \stackrel{t_1}{\to} \bullet \stackrel{t_2}{\to})
    = 
    (\bullet \stackrel{t_1 + t_2}{\to} \bullet)
    \,.
  $$

  Therefore a 1-dimensional [[Euclidean quantum field theory]]

  $$
    Z : Bord_1^{Riem} \to Vect
  $$

  is specified by
  
  * a [[vector space]] $\mathcal{H}$ ("of [[state]]s") assigned to the point;

  * for each $t \in \mathbb{R}_+$ a linear endomorphism

    $$
      U(t) : \mathcal{H} \to \mathcal{H}
    $$

    such that 

    $$  
      U(t_1 + t_2) = U(t_2) \circ U(t_1)
      \,.
    $$

  This is just a system of [[quantum mechanics]]. If we demand that $Z$ respects the [[smooth structure]] on the space of morphisms in $Bord_1^{Riem}$ then there will be a linear map $i H : \mathcal{H} \to \mathcal{H}$ such that

   $$
     U(t) = \exp(i H t)
     \,.
   $$

   This $H$ is called the [[Hamilton operator]] of the system.
   
   (We are glossing here over some technical fine print in the definition of $Bord_1^{Riem}$. Done right we have that $\mathcal{H}$ may indeed be an infinite-dimensional vector space. See [[(1,1)-dimensional Euclidean field theories and K-theory]])

### Classical field theory
 {#ExpositionClassicalFieldTheory}

A special class of examples of $n$-dimensional quantum field theories, as discussed [above](#ExpositionQuantumFieldTheory), arise as [[deformation quantization|deformations]] or _[[path integral|averages]]_ of similar, but simpler structure: _[[classical field theories]]_ . The process that constructs a quantum field theory out of a classical field theory is called _[[quantization]]_ . This is discussed [below](#ExpositionQuantization). Here we describe what a classical field theory is. We shall inevitably oversimplify the situation such as to still count as a leisurely exposition. The kind of examples that the following discussion applies to strictly are field theories <a href="http://nlab.mathforge.org/schreiber/show/infinity-Chern-Simons+theory#DiscreteTargets">of Dijkgraaf-Witten type</a>. But despite its simplicity, this case accurately reflects most of the general abstract properties of the general theory.

For our purposes here, a [[classical field theory]] of dimension $n$ is

* a [[symmetric monoidal functor]]

  $$
    \exp(i S(-)) : Bord_n^S \to Span(Grpd, \mathcal{C})
    \,,
  $$

  where

  * $Bord_n^S$ is the same [[category of cobordisms]] as before;

  * $Span(Grpd, \mathcal{C})$ is the [[category of spans]] of [[groupoid]]s over $\mathcal{C}$:

    * [[object]]s are [[groupoid]]s $K$ equipped with [[functor]]s $\phi : K \to \mathcal{C}$;

    * [[morphism]]s $(K_1, \phi_1) \to (K_2, \phi_2)$ are [[diagram]]s

      $$
        \array{
           && \hat K
           \\
           & \swarrow && \searrow
           \\
           K_1 &&\swArrow&& K_2
           \\
           & \searrow && \swarrow
           \\
           && \mathcal{C}
        }
        \,,
      $$

      where in the middle we have a [[natural transformation]];

    * [[composition]] of morphism is by forming [[2-pullback]]s:

      $$
        (\hat K_2 \circ \hat K_1) = \hat K_1 \prod_{K_2} \hat K_2
        \,.
      $$


Let $\hat \Sigma : \Sigma_1 \to \Sigma_2$ be a [[cobordism]] and

$$
  \exp(i S(-))_{\Sigma} =
  \left(
        \array{
           && Conf_{\hat \Sigma}
           \\
           & {}^{\mathllap{(-)|_{in}}}\swarrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{(-)|_{out}}}
           \\
           Conf_{\Sigma_1} &&\swArrow_{\exp(i S(-)_{\hat \Sigma})}&& Conf_{\Sigma_2}
           \\
           & {}_{V_{\Sigma_1}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{V_{\Sigma_2}}}
           \\
           && \mathcal{C}
        }
  \right)
$$

the value of a classical field theory on $\hat \Sigma$.
We interpret this data as follows:

* $Conf_{\Sigma_1}$ is the [[configuration space]] of a [[classical field theory]] over $\Sigma_1$: [[object]]s are "field configurations" on $\Sigma_1$ and [[morphism]]s are [[gauge transformation]]s between these. Similarly for $Conf_{\Sigma_2}$.

  Here a "physical field" can be something like the [[electromagnetic field]]. But it can also be something very different. For the special case of $\sigma$-models that we are eventually getting at, a "field configuration" here will instead be a way of an particle of shape $\Sigma_1$ sitting in some [[target space]].

* $Conf_{\hat \Sigma}$ is similarly the groupoid of field configurations on the whole cobordism, $\hat \Sigma$. If we think of an object in $Conf_{\hat \Sigma}$ of a way of a [[brane]] of shape $\Sigma_1$ sitting in some [[target space]], then an object in $Conf_{\hat Sigma}$ is a _trajectory_ of that brane in that target space, along which it evolves from shape $\Sigma_1$ to shape $\Sigma_2$.

* $V_{\Sigma_i} : Conf_{\Sigma_i} \to \mathcal{C}$ is the [[classifying space|classifying map]] of a kind of [[vector bundle]] over configuration space: a [[state]] $\psi \in Z(\Sigma_1)$ of the [[quantum field theory]] that will be associated to this [[classical field theory]] by [[quantization]] will be a [[section]] of this vector bundle. Such a section is to be thought of as a generalization of a 
[[probability distribution]] on the space of classical field configurations. The [[generalized element]]s of a [[fiber]] $V_{c}$ of $V_{\Sigma_1}$ over a configuration $c \in Conf_{\Sigma_1}$ may be thought of as an _internal state_ of the brane of shape $\Sigma_1$ sitting in target space. 

* $\exp(i S(-))_{\hat \Sigma}$ is the [[action functional]] that defines the classical field theory: the component

  $$
   \exp(i S(\gamma))_{\hat \Sigma} 
    : 
    V_{\gamma|_{in}}
    \to
    V_{\gamma|_{out}}
  $$

 of this [[natural transformation]] on a trajectory $\gamma \in Conf_{\hat \Sigma}$ going from a configuration $\gamma|_{in}$ to a configuration $\gamma|_{out}$ is a morphism in $\mathcal{C}$ that maps the internal states of the ingoing configuration $\gamma|_{\Sigma_1}$ to the internal states of the outgoing configuration $\gamma|_{\Sigma_2}$. This evolution of internal states encodes the _classical dynamics_ of the system.
 
Notice that this way a classical field theory is taken to be a special case of a [quantum field theory](#ExpositionQuantumFieldTheory), where the codomain of the symmetric monoidal functor is of the special form $Span(Grpd, \mathcal{C})$. For more on this see [[classical field theory as quantum field theory]].

### Quantization
 {#ExpositionQuantization}

We assume now that $\mathcal{C}$ has [[colimit]]s and in fact [[biproduct]]s.

Then for every [[functor]] $\phi : K \to \mathcal{C}$ the [[colimit]] 

$$
  \int^{K} \phi \in \mathcal{C}
$$

exists, and (using the existence of [[biproduct]]s) this construction extends to a [[functor]]

$$
  \int : Span(Grpd, \mathcal{C}) \to \mathcal{C}
  \,.
$$

We call this the _[[path integral]]_ functor.

For

### Classical $\sigma$-models
 {#ExpositionClassicalSigmaModels}


A _classical $\sigma$-model_ is a [classical field theory](#ExpositionClassicalFieldTheory) such that

* the [[configuration space]]s $Conf_{\Sigma}$ are [[mapping spaces]] $\mathbf{H}(\Sigma,X)$ in some suitable category -- some [[cohesive (infinity,1)-topos|higher topos]] in fact -- , for $X$ some fixed [[object]] of that category called _[[target space]]_ ;
 
* the bundles $V_{\Sigma} : Conf_{\Sigma} \to \mathcal{C}$ "of internal states" over these mapping spaces are 

  * the [[transgression]] to these [[mapping space]]s...

  * ...of an [[associated infinity-bundle|associated higher bundle]]... 

  * ...asscociated to a [[circle n-bundle with connection]] on [[target space]]...

  * ...encoded by a classifying morphism

    $$
      \alpha : X \to \mathbf{B}^{n} U(1)
    $$

    into the [[circle n-group]] in $\mathbf{H}$; equipped with an [[connection on an infinity-bundle|n-connection]] $\nabla$...

  * ...where the [[associated bundle|association]] is via a [[representation]]

    $$
      \rho : \mathbf{B}^{n+1} U(1) \to (n+1) Vect
    $$

    on [[n-vector spaces]], which is usually taken to be the canonical 1-dimensional one.

  One calls $(\alpha,\nabla)$ the [[background gauge field]] of the $\sigma$-model.

* The [[action functional]]s $\exp(i S(-))_{\hat \Sigma}$ are given by the [[higher parallel transport]] of $\nabla$ over $\hat \Sigma$.

So an $n$-dimensional $\sigma$-model is a classical field theory that is [[representable functor|represented]], in a sense, by a [[circle n-bundle with connection]] on some [[target space]].

More specifically and more simply, in cases where $X$ is just a [[discrete ∞-groupoid]]  -- the case of  <a href="http://nlab.mathforge.org/schreiber/show/infinity-Chern-Simons%20theory#DiscreteTargets">sigma-models of Dijkgraaf-Witten type</a>, every [[principal ∞-bundle]] on $X$ is necessarily <a href="http://nlab.mathforge.org/nlab/show/cohesive+%28infinity%2C1%29-topos%20--%20structures#FlatDifferentialCohomology">flat</a>, hence the [[background gauge field]] is given just by the morphism

$$
  \alpha : X \to \mathbf{B}^{n} U(1)
  \,.
$$

Then for $\hat \Sigma$ a closed $n$-dimensional manifold, the [[action functional]] of the sigma-model on $\Sigma$ on a field configuration $\gamma : \hat \Sigma \to X$ has the value

$$
  \exp(i S(\gamma))_{\hat \Sigma}
  = 
  \int_{\hat \Sigma} [\alpha]
$$

being the evaluation of $[\alpha]$ regarded as a class in [[ordinary cohomology]] $H^n(\hat \Sigma, U(1))$ evaluated on the [[fundamental class]] of $X$. 

One says that $[\alpha]$ is the [[Lagrangian]] of the theory.


### Quantum $\sigma$-models

(...)

## Examples 

### Non-topological $\sigma$-models 

* The canonical textbook example of a quantum mechanical system is of this form for $n=1$: A line [[vector bundle|bundle]] with [[connection on a bundle|connection]] $E \to X$ on a ([[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo-]])[[Riemannian manifold]] $X$ induces the 1-dimensional [[quantum field theory]] which is the quantum mechanics of a point particle which propagates on $X$, subject to the forces of [[gravity]] (given by the [[pseudo-Riemannian metric]] on $X$) and [[electromagnetism]] (given by the line bundle with connection). The [[Hamilton operator]] encoding this quantum dynamics in this case is the Laplace-operator of $T X$ twisted by the line bundle $E$.

  For $X$ a [[spacetime]] this is called the [[relativistic particle]].

  For $\Sigma$ or $X$ a [[supermanifold]] this is the [[superparticle]].

* Generalizing in the above example the line bundle $E$ by an abelian [[bundle gerbe]] with a connection yields a background for a 2-dimensional $\sigma$-model which mayb be thought of as describing the propgation of a [[string theory|string]].  The best-studied version of this is the case where $X = G$ is a [[Lie group]], in which case this $\sigma$-model is known as the _[[WZW model|Wess--Zumino--Witten model]]_.



### Topological $\sigma$-models 


* [[Dijkgraaf-Witten theory]] is the (2+1)-dimensioanl $\sigma$-model induced from an abelian 2-gerbe on $\mathbf{B} G$, for $G$ a finite group.

* [[Chern-Simons theory]] is supposed to be analogously the $\sigma$-model induced from an abelian 2-gerbe with connection on $\mathbf{B}G$, but now for $G$ a Lie group.

* the [[Poisson sigma-model]] is a model whose target is a [[Poisson Lie algebroid]].

* in [[AKSZ theory]] this is generalized to a large class of sigma models with [[symplectic Lie n-algebroid]]s as target.

* Rozansky--Witten theory is essentially the $\sigma$-model for $X$ a smooth projective variety.

* generally [[schreiber:∞-Chern-Simons theory]] is a $\sigma$-model with a [[smooth ∞-groupoid]] of [[connection on an ∞-bundle|∞-connections]].
