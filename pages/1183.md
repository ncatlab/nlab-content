## Idea
 {#Idea}

A _$\sigma$-model_ is a particular kind of [[classical field theory]], which induces its quantization to a [[quantum field theory]].  The basic data describing a specific $\sigma$-model is some kind of "[[space]]" $X$, in a [[category]] of "[[spaces]]" which includes [[smooth manifolds]].  We call $X$ the [[target space]], and we define the "[[configuration space]] of fields" $Conf_\Sigma$  over a manifold $\Sigma$ to be the [[mapping space]] $Map(\Sigma, X)$.  That is, a "configuration of fields" over a manifold $\Sigma$ is like an an $X$-valued [[function]] on $\Sigma$.

We assign a [[dimension]] $n \in \mathbb{N}$ to our $\sigma$-model, take $dim \Sigma \leq n$ and assume that [[target space]] $X$ is equipped with a "[[circle n-bundle with connection]]".  

For $n = 1$ this is an ordinary [[circle bundle]] [[connection on a bundle|with connection]] and models a configuration of the [[electromagnetic field]] on $X$. To distinguish this "field" on $X$ from the fields on $\Sigma$ we speak of a _[[background gauge field]]_. (This remains fixed background data unless and until we pass to _[[second quantization]]_ .) A field configuration $\Sigma \to X$ on $\Sigma$ models a trajectory of a [[charge]]d particle subject to the [[force]]s exerted by this background field.

For $n = 2$, a circle $n$-bundle with connection is a [[circle n-group|circle 2-group]] [[principal 2-bundle]] or equivalently a [[bundle gerbe]] with connection. This models a "higher electromagnetic field", called a [[Kalb-Ramond field]]. Now $\Sigma$ is taken to be 2-dimensional and a map $\Sigma \to X$ models the trajectory of a [[string]] on $X$, subject to forces exerted on it by this higher order field.

This pattern continues. In the next dimension a [[membrane]] with 3-dimensional [[worldvolume]] is charged under a [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle 3-bundle]] with connection, for instance something called the [[supergravity C-field]].

While one can speak of [[principal ∞-bundles|higher bundles]] in full generality and full analogy to ordinary [[principal bundle]]s, it is useful to observe that any circle $n$-bundle is characterized by a classifying map $\alpha : X \to \mathbf{B}^n U(1)$ in our category of [[space]]s, so we can just think about classifying maps instead.  Here $U(1)$ is the [[circle group]], and $\mathbf{B}^n$ denotes its $n$th _[[delooping]]_ ; thus such a map is also a sort of [[cocycle]] in "[[smooth infinity-groupoid|smooth]] $n$th [[cohomology]] of $X$ with coefficients in $U(1)$". The additional data of a _connection_ refines this to a cocycle in _[[ordinary differential cohomology|differential cohomology]]_ of $X$.

Such connection data $\nabla$ on a circle $n$-bundle defines -- and is defined by -- a notion of [[higher parallel transport]] over $n$-dimensional trajectories: for closed $n$-dimensional $\Sigma$ it defines a map $hol : (\gamma : \Sigma \to X) \mapsto \exp(i \int_\Sigma \gamma^*\nabla) \in U(1)$ that sends trajectories to elements in $U(1)$: the [[holonomy]] of $\nabla$ over $\Sigma$, given by [[integration]] of local data over $\Sigma$. The local data being integrated is called the _[[Lagrangian]]_ of the $\sigma$-model. Its integral is called the [[action functional]]. 

In the _[[QFT|quantum]]_ $\sigma$-model one considers in turn the integral of the [[action functional]] over all of [[configuration space]]: the "[[path integral]]". In the _classical $\sigma$-model_ one considers only the [[critical locus]] of the action functional (where the rough idea is that the path integral to some approximation localizes around the critical locus). Points in this critical locus are said to be configurations that satisfy the "[[Euler-Lagrange equations]] of motion". These are supposed to be the physically realized trajectories among all of them, in the classical approximation.

Finally, just like an ordinary [[circle group]]-[[principal bundle]] has an [[associated bundle|associated]] [[vector bundle]] once we fix a [[representation]] of $U(1)$ to be the [[fiber]]s, any "[[circle n-bundle]]" has an associated "[[n-vector bundle]]" once we fix a "[[∞-representation]]" $\rho : \mathbf{B}^n U(1) \to n Vect$ on "[[n-vector spaces]]".  Just as for the ordinary $U(1)$, here we usually pick the canonical 1-dimensional such "representation".  Finally, we define bundles $V_\Sigma : Conf_\Sigma \to \mathcal{C}$ of "internal states" by [[transgression]] of these associated bundles.

The passage from [[principal ∞-bundle]]s to [[associated ∞-bundle]]s is necessary for the description of the quantum $\sigma$-model: it assigns in positive codimension spaces of [[section]]s of these associated bundles. For a 1-categorical description of the resulting [[QFT]] ordinary vector bundles (assigned in codimension 1) would suffice, but the $\sigma$-model should determine much more: an [[extended quantum field theory]]. This requires sections of higher vector bundles. For instance for $n = 2$ some boundary conditions of the $\sigma$-model are given by sections of the background [[n-vector bundle|2-vector bundle]]: these are the [[twisted bundle|twisted vector bundles]] known as the [[Chan-Paton bundles]] on the [[boundary]]-[[D-brane]]s of the [[string]]. (...)

We now try to fill this with life by spelling out some standard examples. Further [below](Exposition) we look at precise formalizations of the situation.


## Terminology and history
 {#TerminologyAndHistory}

In physics one tends to speak of a _model_ if one specifies a particular [[quantum field theory]] for describing a particular situation, for instance by specifying a [[Lagrangian]] or [[local action functional]] on some [[configuration space]]. This is traditionally not meant in the mathematical sense of _[[model]]_ of some [[theory]]. But in light of progress of mathematically formalizing [[quantum field theory]] (see [[FQFT]] and [[AQFT]]), it can with hindsight be interpreted in this way: 

a $\sigma$-model is supposed to be a type of [[model]] for the [[theory]] called [[quantum field theory]]. This sounds like a tautology, but much effort in mathematical physics is devoted to eventually making this a precise statement. In special cases and toy examples this has been achieved, but for the examples that seem to be directly relevant for the phenomenological description of the observed world, lots of clues still seem to be missing.

As to the "$\sigma$" in "$\sigma$-model": back in the 1960s people were interested in a hypothetical particle called the 
$\sigma$-particle.  [[Murray Gell-Mann]] came up with a theory of them.  It was called ‘the $\sigma$-model’.  It was an old-fashioned field theory where the field took values in a vector space.   Then someone came up with a modified version of the σ-model where the field took values in some other [[manifold]] and this was called ‘the nonlinear σ-model’.  

While the parameter space (the domain space of the fields) of the original $\sigma$-models was supposed to be our [[spacetime]] and the target space was some abstract space, with the advent of [[string theory]] the nonlinear $\sigma$-models gained importance as quantum field theories whose _target space_ is [[spacetime]] $X$ and whose parameter space is some low dimensional space, usually denoted $\Sigma$. A field configuration $\Sigma \to X$ is then interpreted as being the trajectory of an extended fundamental particle -- a fundamental [[brane]] -- in $X$, and the $\sigma$-model describes the quantum mechanics of that brane propagating in $X$.

In particular the [[quantum mechanics]] of a [[relativistic particle]] propagating on $X$ is described by a $\sigma$-model on the [[real line]] $\Sigma = \mathbb{R}$ -- the _worldline_ of the particle.

In [[string theory]] one considers 2-[[dimension]]al $\Sigma$ and thinks of maps $\Sigma \to X$ as being the _worldsheets_ of the trajectory of a string propagating in spacetime.

In the context of [[11-dimensional supergravity]] there is a $\sigma$-model with 3-dimensional $\Sigma$, describing the propagation of a [[membrane]] in [[spacetime]].


## Exposition of classical sigma-models
 {#ExpositionClassical}

We survey, starting from the very basics, [[classical field theory]] aspects of $\sigma$-models that describe dynamics of [[particle]]s, [[strings]]s and [[brane]]s on geometric [[target space]]s.


### The Newtonian particle
 {#ExpositionNewtonianParticle}

With hindsight, the earliest $\sigma$-model ever considered was also the very origin of the science of [[physics]]:

In order to describe the motion of matter [[particles]] in [[space]], [[Isaac Newton]] wrote down a [[differential equation]] with the famous symbols

$$
  \vec F = m \vec a 
  \,.
$$

More in detail, this is meant to describe the following situation:

* write $X := \mathbb{R}^3$ for the [[Cartesian space]] of [[dimension]] 3; think of this as a model for physics space;

* write $\Sigma := \mathbb{R}$ for the [[Cartesian space]] of [[dimensional]] 1; think of this as the abstract trajectory of a point particle;

* write $\gamma : \Sigma \to X$ for a [[smooth function]]; think of this as an actual trajectory of a point particle in $X$;

  write furthermore

  * $\vec v := \dot \gamma \in Hom(T \Sigma, T X)$ for the [[derivative]] of $\gamma$; think of this as the [[velocity]] of the particle; and

  * $\vec a := \ddot \gamma$ for the second [[derivative]], the [[acceleration]] of the particle (strictly speaking this is the [[covariant derivative]] with respect to the trivial [[connection on a bundle|connection]] on the (canonically trivialized) [[tangent bundle]] on $\mathbb{R}^3$, see [below](RelativisticParticle) for the fully fledged discussion).

We call then the collection of all [[smooth function]]s

$$
  Conf := C^\infty(\Sigma, X)
$$

the [[configuration space]] of a physical model of a point particle propagating on $X$. 


In order to define the model -- the model of some physical situation -- 

* pick a [[vector field]] $\vec F \in \Gamma(T X)$ on $X$. Think of this as expressing at each point a [[force]] acting on the particle with trajectory.

  For instance $\vec F := q \vec E$ could be an [[electromagnetic field|electric field]] $\vec E$ influencing the propagation of an electrically charged particle of [[charge]] $q$.

In modern language we may say:

* $\Sigma$ is the [[worldline]] of the particle;

* $X$ is the [[target space]] (expressing the fact that it is the [[codomain]] of a function $\gamma : \Sigma \to X$)

* $\vec F$ is the [[background gauge field]];

and the collection $(\Sigma, X, \vec F)$ of all three is a _$\sigma$-model_ . 

Given this data, the space of solutions to the original [[differential equation]]

$$
  P := \{ \gamma \in Conf | \forall t \in \mathbb{R} : \vec F_{\gamma(t)} = m \vec a(t) \}
$$

is called the [[covariant phase space]] of the model. The configurations in $P \subset Conf$ have the interpretation of being those potential configurations, that describe actual trajectories of [[particle]]s observed in nature.

Notice that in the case of vanishing [[force]] field $\vec F = 0$, the [[equations of motion]] of the [Newtonian particle](#ExpositionNewtonianParticle)

$$
  \vec a = 0
$$

may be read as characterizing precisely the [[geodesic]]s in $\mathbb{R}^3$ regarded as a [[Riemannian manifold]] using the canonical [[metric]]. This is a special and limiting case of the [relativistic particle](#RelativisticParticle) discussed below.

A cautionary note is in order. While the Newtonian particle may serve as an introductory example for motivating the concept of $\sigma$-models, it in general lacks some of the nice properties that later on we shall take to be characteristic of $\sigma$-models. Mainly this is due to the fact that the Newtonian particle is but a limiting approximation to the [[relativistic particle]] to which we turn next.


### The relativistic particle
 {#RelativisticParticle}


The Newtonian particle propagating on $\mathbb{R}^3$, discussed [above](#ExpositionNewtonianParticle), is a special and limiting case of a particle propagating on a 4-dimensional [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]: [[spacetime]]. For historical reasons (the same that led to the theory of [[gravity]] being called a theory of _[[general relativity|relativity]]_ ) this is called the _[[relativistic particle]]_ .

The $\sigma$-model describing the relativistic particle is the following.

* [[target space|Target space]] is a  [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]] $(X,g)$, thought of as [[spacetime]].

* Parameter space $\Sigma = \mathbb{R}$ is the [[real line]], thought of as the abstract [[worldline]] of the particle.

* The [[background gauge field]] is given by a [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle bundle with connection]], which for the moment we shall assume to be topologically trivial and hence be equivalently given by a smooth [[differential form|1-form]] $A \in \Omega^1(X)$. Its [[curvature]] [[exterior derivative]] $F := d A$ is the [[field strength]] of an [[electromagnetic field]] on $X$. 

* The [[configuration space]] is the [[quotient]] (or rather [[action groupoid]])

  $$
    Conf = C^\infty(\mathbb{R}, X)//Diff(\mathbb{R})
    \,,
  $$

  of [[smooth function]]s $\Sigma \to X$ by [[diffeomorphism]]s $\Sigma \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} \Sigma$. Each [[object]] in [[cofiguration space]] is a trajectory $\gamma : \Sigma \to X$ of a particle in spacetime, each morphism/equivalence $\gamma_1 \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} \gamma_2$ : a [[gauge transformation]].

* The [[covariant phase space]] -- the subspace of the configuration space of those configurations that satisfy the [[equations of motion]] -- is defined to be

  $$
    P =
    \{ [\gamma] \in Conf
     |\;\;
    m g(\nabla_{\dot \gamma} \dot \gamma/{\vert \dot \gamma}\vert , - ) =  q F(\dot \gamma, -)
    \;\; \}
    \subset Conf
    \,,
  $$

  where 

  * $\nabla$ denotes the [[covariant derivative]] of the [[Levi-Civita connection]] of the background metric $g$ on the [[tangent bundle]] $T X$ of $X$;

  * the equation is taken to hold in each [[cotangent space]] $T^*_{\gamma(\tau)} X$ for each $\tau \in \mathbb{R}$.

To see what this means, consider some special cases. First regard the case that the background field strenght vanishes, $F = 0$. Then the equations of motion reduce to

$$
  \nabla_{\dot \gamma} \dot \gamma = 0 
  \,.
$$

This says that the trajectory $\gamma$ exhibits [[parallel transport]] of its tangent vectors with respect to the [[Levi-Civita connection]] of the background metric. These curves are precisely the _[[geodesics]]_ of the background geometry. This models motion under the [[force]] exerted by the field of [[gravity]] on our particle.

In the even more special case that $X$ is [[Minkowski spacetime]], where we may find a global [[coordinate chart]] $(\mathbb{R}^4, \eta) \simeq (X,g)$, this are exactly the straight lines in $\mathbb{R}^4$. Given any such, there is precisely one representative in the diffeomorphism class for which $\mathbb{R} \stackrel{\gamma}{\to} \mathbb{R}^4 \stackrel{x^0}{\to} \mathbb{R}$ is the identity, hence for which the [[worldline]] parameter coincides precisely with the chosen global time coordinate $t := x^0$ on $\mathbb{R}^4$. For those the equations of motions are again those of the free Newtonian particle $\vec a = 0$.

Remaining in the case that $X$ is [[Minkowski space]] but allowing now a nontrivial background field, notice that we may write the 2-form $F$ always as

$$
  F = \vec E_i \cdot d x^i \wedge d t + \vec B^i \epsilon_{i j k} d x^j \wedge d x^j
  \,,
$$

where $\vec E \in \mathbb{R}^3$ is the electric field strength vector and $\vec B \in \mathbb{R}^3$ the magnetic field strength vector. The spatial part of the above equations of motion are in this case again as for a Newtonian particle

$$
  m \vec a = q \vec E + q \vec v \times \vec B
  \,,
$$

where in the second term we have the [[cross product]] of vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$. The [[force]] on the right is the _[[Lorentz force]]_ exerted by an electromagnetic field on a charged particle.

Notice that the equations of motion imply, generally, that the [[norm]] of $\dot \gamma$ is constant along the trajectory

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \frac{d}{d \tau} g(\dot \gamma, \dot \gamma)
    &= 2 g(\nabla_{\dot \gamma} \dot \gamma, \dot \gamma)
    \\
    & = 
    2 g(g^{-1}(F(\dot \gamma,-), -), \dot \gamma)
    \\
    & \propto F(\dot \gamma, \dot \gamma)
    \\
    & = 
    0
  \end{aligned}
   \,.
$$

Therefore a trajectory that solves the equations of motion and whose tangent vector is [[timelike]] or [[spacelike]] or [[lightlike]], respectively at any instant is so throughout. In particular, no choice of gravitational and electromagnetic background field strength can accelerate a physical particle from being timelike to being light-like.

Experiments around the second half of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century established that this covariant phase space correctly describes the dynamics of gravitationally and electromagnetically charged relativistic particles,. But also formally this phase space is not a randomly chosen space; instead, it is the [[critical locus]] of a (mathematically) natural [[action functional]].

The points in the [[covariant phase space]]

$$
  P := \{ [\gamma] \in Conf | 
   m g(\nabla_{\dot \gamma} \dot \gamma / {\vert \dot \gamma}\vert,-) =  q\iota_{\dot \gamma} F
    \}
  \subset Conf 
$$

happen to be the local critical points of the [[functional]]

$$
  S : Conf \to \mathbb{R}
$$

given by

\[
  \label{ParticleActionForGlobalA}
  \begin{aligned}
    S([\gamma]) 
     & := 
     S_{kin}([\gamma])
     +
     S_{gauge}([\gamma])
     \\
     & 
     := 
     m \int_\Sigma dvol(\gamma^*g)  + q \int_\Sigma \gamma^* A
  \end{aligned}
  \,,
\]

where on the left we have the integral of the [[volume form]] of the pullback $\gamma^* g \in Sym^2 T^* \Sigma$ of the metric on target space to the [[worldline]].

This is called the _[[action functional]]_ of the relativistic particle $\sigma$-model. The first summand is called the _kinetic action_ , the second is calle the _gauge coupling_  action. 

Typically one characterizes $\sigma$-models in terms of such action functionals, so that the [[covariant phase space]] is then given as their [[critical locus]]. This usually yields a simpler and deeper description of the model. 

Notably the above action functional has an evident generalization to the case where the background [[electromagnetic field]] is not given by a globally defined 1-form, but more generally by a [[circle n-bundle with connection|cicle bundle with connection]] $\nabla$: if we pass to the exponentiated action functional

$$
  \exp(i S(-)) : Conf \to U(1)
$$

$$
  \exp(i S(\gamma)) = 
  \exp(S_{kin}(\gamma))
   \;\;
  \exp(i q \int_\Sigma \gamma^* A)
$$

the second factor is precisely the [[holonomy]] of $\nabla$ over the worldline. Hence for general electromagnetic background gauge fields the action functional is (assuming for simplicity now closed curves with $\Sigma = S^1$)

$$
  \exp(i S(\gamma))   
  = 
  \exp(S_{kin}(\gamma))
   \;\;
  hol(\nabla, \gamma)
  \,.
$$

This is the beginning of an important pattern: most $\sigma$-models are determined by a kind of higher [[gauge field]] $\nabla$ on [[target space]] (a cocycle in the [[differential cohomology]] of [[target space]]) and their dynamics is determined by an [[action functional]] that is the [[higher parallel transport|higher holonomy]] functional of this gauge field. 

At the same time the kinetic action functional factor is usually to be understood as part of the [[measure]] on [[configuration space]] $Conf$. For the particle this has been made precise: the [[path integral]] 

$$
 \int_{\gamma \in Conf} hol(\nabla,\gamma) \;\;\exp(i S_{kin}(\gamma)) [d \gamma]
  :=
 \int_{\gamma \in Conf} hol(\nabla,\gamma) d \mu_{Wien}
$$

can be interpreted as the [[integral]] with respect to the [[Wiener measure]] on path space (after [[Wick rotation]], at least). The kinetic part of the action functional is then absorbed into the Wiener measure $d \mu_{Wien}$

$$
  \exp(i S_{kin}(\gamma)) [d\gamma] := d \mu_{Wien}
  \,;
$$

(at least after replacing the kinetic [[Nambu-Goto action]] by the classically equivalent [[Polyakov action]])
and the path integral is just the "expectation value" (after Wick rotation) of the holonomy, taken over all trajectories.

Since there is a good general abstract theory of higher gauge fields and their higher holonomies (see [[differential cohomology]] and [[cohesive (infinity,1)-topos|differential cohomology in a cohesive topos]]), this suggests that there should be a general abstract theory of $\sigma$-models. Aspects of this are discussed [below](Exposition).


### The relativistic $(n-1)$-brane
 {#RelativisticNBrane}

It is hard not to consider the following generalization of the relativistic particle $\sigma$-model, that we discussed [above](#RelativisticParticle):

notice that nothing in the structure of the relativistic particle's [[action functional]] (eq:ParticleActionForGlobalA) relies on the [[dimension]] of $\Sigma$ being $1$. Instead, it is just the degree-1 case of the following family of types of classical $\sigma$-models, that make sense for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$:

* let $\Sigma$ be of [[dimension]] $n$;

* let [[target space]] be a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]] $(X,g)$ as before;

* let the [[background gauge field]] be given by a smooth [[differential form|differential n-form]] $A \in \Omega^n(X)$.

* let [[configuration space]] be the [[action groupoid|weak quotient]]

  $$
    Conf_\Sigma := C^\infty(\Sigma, X)//Diff(\Sigma)   
    \,.
  $$

* let then finally the [[action functional]] be given by

  $$
    S([\gamma]) = \int_\Sigma dvol(\gamma^* g) + \int_\Sigma \gamma^* A
    \,.
  $$

This is the same formula as for the relativistic particle as before, only that now the differential forms are taken to be of degree $n$ and integrals to be over $n$-dimensional spaces.

Moreover, for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ there is an analog of the generalization 

$$
  \{1-forms\} \hookrightarrow \{circle bundles with connection\}
$$

to the generalization

$$
  \{n-forms\} \hookrightarrow \{circle n-bundles with connection\}
  \,.
$$

Given any [[circle n-bundle with connection]] $\nabla$ and closed $\Sigma$ of dimension $n$, there is a [[higher parallel transport|higher]] [[holonomy]] [[functional]]

$$
  hol(\nabla, -) : (\Sigma \stackrel{\gamma}{\to} X) \mapsto 
  hol(\nabla, \gamma) \in U(1)
$$

that extends the functional $A \mapsto \exp(i \int_\Sigma \gamma^* A)$.

Therefore, generally, we may take for $n \in \mathbb{N}$

* the [[background gauge field]] on $X$ is a [[circle n-bundle with connection]] $\nabla$;

* the exponentiated [[action functional]] is 

  $$
    [\gamma] \mapsto \exp(i \int_\Sigma dvol(\gamma^* )) \;\;\; hol(\nabla,\gamma)
   \,.
  $$


For $n = 3$ such a $\sigma$-model describes an analog of a relativistic particle which is not point-like, but 2-dimensional (with 3-dimensional trajectory) hence which reminds one of a [[membrane]]. Inspired by this term, the general case has come to be known as the _relativistic $(n-1)$-[[brane]]_ . 

The case $n = 2$ is called the relativistic [[string]], which we consider in more detail [below](#RelativisticString). This has received a lot of attention (in _[[string theory]]_ ) not just because it is the next simplest in an infinite hierarchy of cases, but also because its quantum theory turns out to have various interesting features that seem to make it special. Moreover, many of the $(n-1)$-branes for other $n$ re-appear in one way or other in the study of the string (as its boundary [[D-brane]]s in all dimensions $0 \leq n \leq 10$, as its "strongly coupled" version: the [[M-theory membrane]], or as its [[electric-magnetic duality|electric-magnetic dual]]: the [[NS5-brane]]). If nothing else, the seemingly innocent step from $n = 1$ to $n = 2$ in the $\sigma$-model shows that there is a rich pattern of higher dimensional ($\sigma$-model) quantum field theories that are all interrelated in intricate ways.

Another important special case for the general discussion of $\sigma$-models is the case of the [[membrane]], $n = 3$, for which the [[background gauge field]] is a _[[Chern-Simons circle 3-bundle]]_ for some $G$-[[principal bundle]] on $X$, for $G$ some suitable [[Lie group]]. In this case the gauge-coupling [[Lagrangian]] of the $\sigma$-model is, locally, the [[Chern-Simons form]] $CS(\nabla_\mathfrak{g})$ of a $G$-[[connection on a bundle|connection]] $\nabla_{\mathfrak{g}}$, hence the [[action functional]] is (locally) the [[Chern-Simons theory|Chern-Simons functional]]

$$
  (\Sigma \stackrel{\gamma}{\to} X) \mapsto \int_\Sigma CS(\gamma^* \nabla_\mathfrak{g})
  \,.
$$

Below we will see that when $\sigma$-models are considered [[internalization|internal to]] a suitable [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]], then there are _universal_ $\sigma$-models of this Chern-Simons type, whose [[target space]] is no longer a [[smooth manifold]], but a [[smooth ∞-groupoid]] incarnation of a [[classifying space]] $B G$. 


### The relativistic string
 {#RelativisticString}

The important case $n = 2$ of the general [(n-1)-brane sigma-model](RelativisticNBrane) that we considered above is called the [[string]]-$\sigma$-model. Even though this is just the first step after the relativistic particle, the theory of this $\sigma$-model is already considerably richer. Classically and all the more so after quantization. For the purposes of this exposition here we only briefly indicate the physical interpretation of the $\sigma$-model and then consider some qualitatively new higher [[gauge theory]] aspects, that appear in this dimension.


First notice that by the general reasoning of relativistic $(n-1)$-branes, the [[background gauge field]] is now given (if we assume for the moment a topological trivial class) by a 2-form, which is traditionally denoted $B \in \Omega^2(X)$ and called the _[[B-field]]_ . Its 3-form [[curvature]] [[field strength]] is traditionally denoted $H := d B$.

The [[action functional]] of the [[string]]'s $\sigma$-model for a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo-Riemannian]] [[target space]] $(X,g)$ with background gauge field $B$ is

$$
  [\gamma] \mapsto \int_\Sigma dvol(\gamma^* g) + \int_\Sigma \gamma^* B
  \,.
$$

To gain insight into the physical meaning of this, consider the simple case that [[target space]] $(X,g)$ is [[Minkowski spacetime]] and that the [[worldsheet]] $\Sigma = \mathbb{R} \times S^1$ is the [[cylinder]]. With $(\tau,\sigma)$ the two canonical [[coordinate]]s on $\Sigma$, we still write 

$$
  \dot \gamma := \partial_\tau \gamma
$$

for the derivative "along the trajectory" (along the $\mathbb{R}$-factor), but now we also have the derivative $\partial_\sigma \gamma$ which we may think of as being _tangential to the string_ at any instant of its trajectory. A field configuration $\gamma : \Sigma \to X$ may be thought of as the trajectory of a [[circle]] propagating in $X$.

The critical trajectories $\gamma : \Sigma \to X$ are found to be those that satisfy the 2-dimensional [[wave equation]]

$$
  g(\ddot \gamma,-)  - g(\partial_\sigma^2 \gamma,-)
  = 
  H(\dot \gamma, \partial_\sigma \gamma,-)
$$

on the [[worldsheet]]. Comparison with the equation of motion of the  [relativistic particle](#RelativisticParticle) shows that $H(\partial_\sigma \gamma, -,-)$ plays the role of an electromagnetic [[field strength]] 2-form.  Hence the string behaves as if electric [[charge]] is spread out evenly along it. 

For _point particle limit configurations_  $\gamma$, where the string has vanishing extension in that $\partial_\sigma \gamma = 0$, the above equation reduces again to free motion

$$
  \ddot \gamma = \vec a = 0
$$

and for general $(X,g)$ to the corresponding [[geodesic]] motion.

Therefore close to these point particle configurations the string looks like a little oscillating loop whose dynamics is that of its "center of mass" point, but slightly modified by the energy in the oscillations and the way these interact with the background fields. After quantization of the $\sigma$-model, these oscillations have a discrete ( quantized!) set of possible frequencies, and indeed each of the oscillation modes makes the string appear in the point particle limit as one species or other of a relativistic particle. (For more on this see _[[string theory]]_ .)

Next we have a look at aspects of higher [[gauge theory]] that appears in $n = 2$.

The above 2-form $B$ is in general just the local connection form of a _[[circle n-bundle with connection|circle 2-bundle with connection]]_ $\nabla$ on $X$, given (as its [[homotopy fiber]]) by a morphism of [[smooth ∞-groupoid]]s $\alpha : X \to \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)$. Equivalently this is a $U(1)$-[[bundle gerbe]] with connection.

There is a canonical 1-dimensional [[infinity-representation|2-representation]] of the [[circle n-group|circle 2-group]] $\mathbf{B} U(1)$ on [[2-vector space]]s:

$$
  \rho : \mathbf{B} \mathbf{B}U(1) \to 2 Vect
  \,.
$$

Hence the corresponding [[associated infinity-bundle|associated 2-bundle]] is classified by a morphism

$$
  \rho(g) : X \stackrel{g}{\to} \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)
   \stackrel{\rho}{\to}
  2 Vect
  \,.
$$

One can consider the string $\sigma$-model for [[worldsheet]]s with [[boundary]]. A careful analysis then shows that the consistent Dirichlet-type boundary conditions that can be added correspond, roughly,  to certain subspace of [[target space]] -- called [[D-brane]]s -- that are equipped with a section $V : \mathbf{1} \to \rho(g)|_{D-brane}$ of the background gauge field 
[[n-vector bundle|2-vector bundle]] restricted to the $D$-brane. Such a section is precisely a [[twisted bundle|twisted vector bundle]] on the brane, where the twist is the class in [[integral cohomology]] $H^3(X, \mathbb{Z})$ of the background gauge field. More generally, these twisted bundles are cocycles in [[twisted K-theory]] and [[differential K-theory]]. Hence more [[differential cohomology]] appears on the target space for the string in the presence of string boundaries.

More generally, the structure [[2-group]] of the background [[principal 2-bundle]] need not be $\mathbf{B}U(1)$, which is given by the [[crossed module]] $[U(1) \to 1]$. Instead, it can be the [[automorphism 2-group]] $AUT(U(1))$, which is given by the crossed module $(U(1) \to Aut(U(1)) \simeq \mathbb{Z}_2)$. An $AUT(U(1))$-[[principal 2-bundle]] on $X$ is equivalently a double cover of $X$, equipped with a circle 2-bundle that has a twisted [[equivariant cohomology|equivariance]] under the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-[[action]].  Such a background gauge field structure is called an _string [[orientifold]]_ background. This is a kind of [[higher category theory|higher structure]] that the relativistic particle alone cannot see.

More such higher structure appears as one passes to the [[supergeometry]] analogs of the $\sigma$-models that we have considered so far: the [[superstring]]. The presence of the additional [[fermion]] fields that this brings with it (both on [[target space]] as well as on the [[worldsheet]]) influences all the structures that we have considered so far. For instance a phenonemon called a fermionic [[quantum anomaly]] forces the above background [[circle n-bundle|circle 2-bundle]] to become a [[twisted cohomology|twisted 2-bundle]], where the twist is given by a [[fivebrane]] [[charge]] [[Chern-Simons circle 3-bundle]]. This is discussed in detail at _[[differential string structure]]_

These are the first examples of a general phenomenon: as $n$ increases, a background gauge $n$-bundle with connection may constitute considerably more structure then one might naively expect from a generalization of the ordinary notion of a connection. More examples of this phenomenon arise when we allow our [[target space]]s to be general [[smooth ∞-groupoid]]s, below.

## Exposition of higher gauge theories as $\sigma$-models
 {#GaugeTheoryAsSigmaModel}

### Higher geometric target spaces
 {#HigherGeometricTargetSpaces}

The classical $\sigma$-models discussed 
[above](ExpositionClassical) all have [[target space]]s that are [[smooth manifold]]s. However, we saw that from [[dimension]] $d \geq 2$ on, the [[background gauge field]]s on these target spaces are naturally no longer just [[principal bundle]]s [[connection on a bundle|with connection]]: instead they are smoth [[principal 2-bundle]]s, then smooth principal 3-bundles, etc. and eventually generally [[principal ∞-bundle]]s with [[connection on an ∞-bundle|∞-connections]]. But the total [[space]] of such higher smooth bundles is no longer in general a [[smooth manifold]] anymore: instead, the total space is a _[[Lie groupoid]]_ for $d = 2$ , then a _[[Lie 2-groupoid]]_ for $d = 3$ and eventually generally a [[smooth ∞-groupoid]].

This means that -- unless we would artifically treat the total space of a [[background gauge field]] bundle on different grounds than its base space -- the general theory of $\sigma$-models should naturally include target spaces that are not just smooth manifolds. 

At least from $d = 2$ on, for instance, target spaces should be allowed to be [[Lie groupoid]]s. This has a fairly long tradition: the _[[proper groupoid|proper]] [[étale groupoid|étale]]_ [[Lie groupoid]]s are precisely _[[orbifold]]s_ : spaces that are locally isomorphic to sufficiently nice quotients of a [[Cartesian space]] by a [[group]] [[action]]. Orbifolds have received a lot of attention in the study of [[string]] [[sigma-model]]s. The [[orientifold]] background gauge fields mentioned [above](RelativisticString) involve in general a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-orbifold target space, for instance.

But once we pass to the higher geometry of [[Lie groupoid]]s at all, there is no good reason to restrict back to those that are orbifolds. For instance for any [[Lie group]] $G$ there is its _[[delooping]]_ Lie groupoid, the [[action groupoid]] of the trivial action of $G$ on the point, which we shall write 

$$
  \mathbf{B}G := *//G
  \,;
$$

and this should perfectly serve as a [[target space]] object for $\sigma$-models, too. Here the boldface notation is to indicate that this Lie groupoid is a smooth refinement of the [[classifying space]] $B G \in Top$ of the Lie group: in fact, where $B G$ gives [[isomorphism class]] of smooth $G$-principal bundles, $\mathbf{B}G$ also remembers the [[isomorphism]]s themselves -- and hence in particular the [[automorphism]]s -- of these bundles: it is the _[[moduli stack]]_ of smooth $G$-principal bundles: for $\Sigma$ a [[smooth manifold]] we have that the _groupoid_ of morphisms of [[smooth infinity-groupoid|smooth groupoid]]s $\Sigma \to \mathbf{B}G$ (the _correct_ morphisms, sometimes called _[[Morita morphism]]_ to distinguish them from any incorrect notion) is that of smooth $G$-principal bundles and smooth homomorphisms between these

$$
  SmoothGrpd(\Sigma, \mathbf{B}G) \simeq G Bund(\Sigma) \in Grpd
  \,,
$$

whereas the [[geometric realization]] $B G \simeq \vert \mathbf{B}G\vert$ only sees the equivalence classes:
$$
  [\Sigma, B G] \simeq \pi_0 G Bund(\Sigma) \in Set
  \,.
$$ 

This indicates that ([[nonabelian cohomology|nonabelian]]) [[gauge theory]] on $\Sigma$ should have a formulation as a $\sigma$-model with target "[[space]]" $X$ the Lie groupoid $X = \mathbf{B}G$: a $\sigma$-model field $\Sigma \to X = \mathbf{B}G$ is a $G$-bundle, and an isomorphism of field configurations is a [[gauge transformation]] of $G$-bundles.

But a field configuration in $G$-gauge theory on $\Sigma$ is not just a $G$-principal bundle, but is a $G$-bundle _with [[connection on a bundle|connection]]_ . There is no Lie groupoid that that would similarly represent such connections as a target space object. But there is a _[[smooth infinity-groupoid|smooth groupoid]]_ that does: $\mathbf{B}G_{conn}$, the [[groupoid of Lie algebra valued 1-forms]].

Here by a _smooth groupoid_ we mean a [[groupoid]] that comes with a rule for which of its collections of objects or morphisms are _smoothly parameterized families_ . Technically this is a _[[(2,1)-sheaf]]_ or _[[stack]]_ on the [[site]] [[CartSp]] of [[Cartesian space]]s and [[smooth function]]s between them. Among all smooth groupoids, Lie groupoids -- and generally [[diffeological space|diffeological groupoid]]s -- are singled out as being the _[[concrete sheaf|concrete]]_ objects. While it is useful to know if a given smooth groupoid is [[concrete sheaf|concrete]] or even [[Lie groupoid|Lie]], quite independent of that all of [[higher geometry|higher]] [[differential geometry]] exists for general smooth $\infty$-groupoids just as well. Therefore if we can allow Lie groupoids as targets for $\sigma$-models, we can allow general smooth groupoids as well.

The non-concrete smooth groupoid $\mathbf{B}G_{conn}$ that we just mentioned is defined by the following rule: for $U \in $ [[CartSp]], a smoothly $U$-paramezterized family of objects is by definition a $\mathfrak{g}$-[[Lie algebra valued 1-form|valued differential 1-form]] $A \in \Omega^1(U, \mathfrak{g})$ on $U$, where $\mathfrak{g}$ is the [[Lie algebra]] of $G$. A smoothly $U$-parameterized family of morphisms $g : A_1 \to A_2$ is a smooth [[gauge transformation]] $g \in C^\infty(U, G) : A_2 = g A g^{-1} + g d g^{-1}$ between two such form data. (This is "non-concrete" because the smooth $U$-parameterized families $U \to \mathbf{B}G_{conn}$ are not $U$-families of points $* \to \mathbf{B}G_{conn}$).

One then finds that the [[mapping space]] groupoid for this target $X = \mathbf{B}G_{conn}$ is the groupoid 

$$
  SmoothGrpd(\Sigma , \mathbf{B}G_{conn})
   \simeq
  G Bund_{conn}(\Sigma)
  \,,
$$

whose objects are smooth $G$-principal bundles with conection on $\Sigma$, and whose morphisms are smooth morophisms of principal bundles with connection. 
This groupoid is the [[configuration space]] of $G$-[[gauge theory]] on $\Sigma$, for instance of $G$-[[Yang-Mills theory]] or of $G$-[[Chern-Simons theory]]:

$$
  SmoothGrpd(\Sigma, \mathbf{B}G_{conn})
  \simeq 
   Conf_{Yang-Mills}(\Sigma)
  \simeq
   Conf_{Chern-Simons}(\Sigma)
  \,.
$$

Notice that this configuration space is now itself a groupoid: morphisms are [[gauge transformation]]s. In fact, it is naturally itself a smooth groupoid (when we read the [[hom-object]] here as an [[internal hom]] in [[Smooth∞Grpd|SmoothGrpd]].) In the traditional physics literature these Lie groupoidal [[configuration space]]s of fields are best known in terms of their [[infinitesimal object|infinitesimal]] approximation $Lie(Conf(\Sigma)) \in LieAld$, which are _[[Lie algebroid]]s_ , and these in turn are best known in terms of their [[function algebras on ∞-stacks|function algebras]], called the _[[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]]s_ $CE(Lie(Conf(\Sigma)))$: this [[dg-algebra]] is in physics called the [[BRST complex]]. Its degree-1 generators, the [[cotangent vector|cotangents]] to the [[morphism]]s of $Conf(\Sigma)$, are called the _ghost fields_ of gauge theory.

Of coure we already saw secretly groupoidal configuration spaces in the [above](ExpositionClassical) list of examples of $\sigma$-models of relativistic [[brane]]s. We said that their configuration spaces $C^\infty(\Sigma,X)//Diff(\Sigma)$ were [[quotient]]s; but really they are to be taken as higher categorical quotients, known as _[[homotopy colimit|homotopy quotients]]_ or _[[2-colimit|weak quotients]]_ : they are the [[action groupoid]]s of $Diff(\Sigma)$ acting on $C^\infty(\Sigma,X)$.

We will see in the examples below that there is, of course, no reason to stop after passing from target manifolds to smooth target groupoids. At least as the $\sigma$-model increases in dimension, it is natural to consider smooth target [[2-groupoid]]s, target [[3-groupoid]]s, ... target [[n-groupoid]]s  and eventually [[smooth ∞-groupoids]]. The full context of smooth $\infty$-groupoids is the natural completion of traditional [[differential geometry]] to _[[higher geometry]]_ .


Given that it does thus make sense to regard general [[smooth ∞-groupoid]]s as target spaces for $\sigma$-models, the questions is if there are useful [[background gauge field]]s on such. This is indeed the case:

for instance we have a <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/smooth%20infinity-groupoid#CohomologyOfLieGroups">theorem</a> that says that for $G$ a compact Lie group, there is, for every integral cohomology class $c \in H^{n+1}(B G, \mathbb{Z})$ of the classifying space of $G$ -- a [[characteristic class]] for $G$-principal bundles -- up to equivalence a unique smooth lift $\mathbf{c} : \mathbf{B}G \to \mathbf{B}^n U(1)$ to a smooth [[circle n-bundle]] on the smooth $\mathbf{B}G$. Moreover, we have a [[infinity-Chern-Weil theory|theorem]] that for sufficiently highly connected Lie groups or smooth $\infty$-groups $G$, this refines canonically to a [[circle n-bundle with connection]] on the differentially refined smooth moduli space $\mathbf{B}G_{conn}$, given by a morphism:

$$
  \hat \mathbf{c} : \mathbf{B}G_{conn} \to \mathbf{B}^n U(1)_{conn}
  \,.
$$

This assignment generalizes the classical [[Chern-Weil homomorphism]]: we may speak of the _[[∞-Chern-Weil homomorphism]]_ . The first example [below](#SigmaCS) shows that ordinary [[Chern-Simons theory]] is a $\sigma$-model that arises this way. Generally we may this speak of $\sigma$-models with target space a [[smooth ∞-groupoid]] and [[background gauge field]]s given by the [[∞-Chern-Weil homomorphism]] this way as [[schreiber:∞-Chern-Simons theories]]. 

The second example [below](#SigmaDW) shows that ordinatry [[Dijkgraaf-Witten theory]] is a $\sigma$-model that arises this way when $G$ is a [[discrete group]]. Generally we may thus speak of $\sigma$-models with target space a [[discrete ∞-groupoid]] and  [[background gauge field]]s given by the [[∞-Chern-Weil homomorphism]] this way as [[schreiber:∞-Dijkgraaf-Witten theories]]. 


### Chern-Simons theory as a $\sigma$-model
 {#SigmaCS}

One of the earliest [[topological quantum field theories]] ever considered in detail is _[[Chern-Simons theory]]_ . We introduce this from the point of view of $\sigma$-models with higher geometric target spaces as discussed [above](#HigherGeometricTargetSpaces). 

An ordinary (as opposed to higher) _[[gauge theory]]_ is a [[quantum field theory]] whose field configurations on a manifold $\Sigma$ are [[connection on a bundle|connections]] on $G$-[[principal bundle]]s over $\Sigma$, for $G$ some [[Lie group]]. The word _[[gauge transformation]]_ is essentially the physics equivalent of the word _[[isomorphism]]_ , referring to isomorphisms in a [[configuration space]] of a field theory and specifically to isomorphisms between such bundles with connection. The [[action functional]] of a gauge theory is to be _[[gauge invariance|gauge invariant]]_ meaning that it assigns the same value to configurations that are related by a gauge transformaiton. This means precisely that the exponentiated action is a [[functor]]

$$
  \exp(i S(-)) :  G Bund_{conn}(\Sigma) \to U(1)
$$

from the [[groupoid]] of gauge field configurations and gauge transformaitons, to the [[circle group]] (regarded as a [[0-truncated]] groupoid).

The first nonabelian gauge theory to receive attention was _[[Yang-Mills theory]]_ : in that model $\Sigma$ is a 4-dimensional [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]] modelling [[spacetime]]. The exponentiated [[action functional]] is given by the integral of differential 4-forms naturally associated with a connection and a Riemannian structure:

$$
  \exp(i S_{YM}(-)) : (P, \nabla) \mapsto \exp(i \int_\Sigma 
     \frac{1}{e^2} \langle F_\nabla \wedge \star F_\nabla\rangle 
     +
     i \theta \langle F_\nabla \wedge  F_\nabla 
   \rangle)
  \,.
$$

Here

* $P$ is any $G$-[[principal bundle]] and $\nabla$ a [[connection on a bundle|connection]] on it;

* $F_\nabla \in \Omega^2(P, \mathfrak{g})$ is the [[Lie algebra]]-valued [[curvature]] 2-form of this connection;

* $\langle -,-\rangle : \mathfrak{g} \otimes \mathfrak{g} \to \mathbb{R}$ is an _[[invariant polynomial]]_ on the Lie algebra: a bilinear form that is gauge invariant when evaluated on curvature 2-forms --  for $\mathfrak{g}$ a [[semisimple Lie algebra]] this would be the _[[Killing form]]_ and for a [[matrix Lie algebra]] this is simply the [[trace]] operation on products of matrices;

* $\star$ is the [[Hodge star]] operator given by the pseudo-Riemannian metric structure on $\Sigma$. 

* $e \in \mathbb{R}$ is some constant, called the [[coupling constant]] of the model;

* $\theta$ is another parameter called the [[theta-angle]]. 

The first summand in the exponent, that depending on the pseudo-Riemannian structure, is the crucial term for the direct application of this as a model of phenomenologically observed physics: it controls the dynamics of three of the four [[force]] fields in the [[standard model of particle physics]]. 

Instead of investigating this further, we shall here look at the case where $\frac{1}{e^2}$ is set to 0. While not _directly_ of phenomenological relevance, this is of quite some interest for the general theoretical understanding of the space of all possible field theories. Since the resulting action functional

$$
  \exp(i S_{tYM}) : (P, \nabla) \mapsto \exp(i \int_\Sigma \langle F_\nabla \wedge F_\nabla \rangle) 
$$

no longer depends on any extra (pseudo-Riemannian) structure on $\Sigma$ this may be interpreted as defining a [[topological quantum field theory]] : one speaks of _[[topological Yang-Mills theory]]_ .

This is not quite a $\sigma$-model in the sense that we have been discussing: while the [[configuration space]] of [[topological Yang-Mills theory]] does consist of maps into the [[target space]] $X = \mathbf{B}G_{conn}$ (the smooth [[moduli stack]] of $G$-principal bundles with connection, as discussed [above](HigherGeometricTargetSpaces)),  there is no way that the above action functional is induced directly from the transgression of the [[higher parallel transport|higher holonomy]] of a [[circle n-bundle with connection]] on this target space.  This is because, at least for [[semisimple Lie group]]s $G$, these are nontrivial only for odd $n$, whereas here we have $n = dim \Sigma = 4$.

But something closely related is true: $\exp(i S_{tYM})$ is the integrated _[[curvature]]_ functional of a circle $3$-bundle with connection on $\mathbf{B}G_{conn}$: what we call the _[[Chern-Simons circle 3-bundle]]_ .

This means the following: in generalization of how an ordinary [[circle bundle]] with connection $\nabla$ has a [[curvature]] 2-form, a [[circle n-bundle with connection]] $\nabla$ on a manifold $X$ has a curvature $(n+1)$-form $F_\nabla \in \Omega^{n+1}_{cl}(X)$. These curvature forms are closed, but not necessarily exact. Nevertheless, a generalization of the [[Stokes theorem]] holds true for them: for $\Sigma$ of dimension $n+1$ and denoting by $\partial \Sigma$ the [[boundary]] of $\Sigma$ and by $\gamma : \Sigma \to X$ a $\Sigma$-shaped trajectory in $X$, we have that the integral of the curvature over $\Sigma$ equals the [[higher parallel transport|higher holonomy]] of $\nabla$ over $\partial_\Sigma$:

$$
  \exp(i \int_\Sigma \phi^* F_\nabla)
  = 
  hol(\nabla, \gamma|_{\partial \Sigma})  
  \,.
$$

This property in fact characterizes equivalence classes of circle $n$-bundles with connection. When conceiving of circle $n$-bundles with connection as rules for assigning higher holonomy that satisfy this property, one speaks of _[[Cheeger-Simons differential characters]]_ . 

Therefore, if we can find a circle 3-bundle with connection on the [[moduli stack]] $\mathbf{B}G_{conn}$ of $G$-principal bundles with connection whose [[curvature]] 4-form at $(P,\nabla)$ is $\langle F_\nabla \wedge F_\nabla \rangle$, then we can interpret [[topological Yang-Mills theory]] on a 4-dimensional $\Sigma$ with boundary as being given by a $\sigma$-model on $\partial \Sigma$ with [[background gauge field]] that circle 3-bundle. 

For $G$ a connected and [[simply connected]] Lie group, such a circle 3-bundle indeed exists. Its characteristic morphism 

$$
  \frac{1}{2}\hat \mathbf{p}_1 : 
  \mathbf{B}G_{conn}
   \to 
  \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)_{conn}
$$

from the smooth moduli stack of $G$-bundles with connection to the smooth moduli 3-groupoid of [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle 3-bundles with connection]] is constructed and discussed in (<a href="http://ncatlab.org/schreiber/show/differential+cohomology+in+an+(∞%2C1)-topos+--+references#FSS">Fiorenza-Schreiber-Stasheff</a>), see _[[Chern-Simons circle 3-bundle]]_ . This is the differential refinement of the [[differential string structure|smooth first fractional Pontryagin class]]

$$
  \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{p}_1 : \mathbf{B}G \to \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)
$$

which in turn is a smooth refinement of the fractional [[Pontryagin class]]

$$
  \frac{1}{2} p_1 : B G \to B^3 U(1) \simeq K(\mathbb{Z}, 4)
$$

of the [[classifying space]] $B G$.

To get a feeling for what this circle 3-bundle is like, we look at what its pull-back $\frac{1}{2}\hat \mathbf{p}_1(\phi) : \Sigma \stackrel{\phi}{\to} \mathbf{B}G_{conn} \stackrel{\frac{1}{2} \hat \mathbf{p}_1}{\to} \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)_{conn}$ to $\Sigma$ along any field configuration $\phi : \Sigma \to X = \mathbf{B}G_{conn}$ is like.

Notice that for simply conneced $G$ the [[classifying space]] $B G$ has vanishing [[homotopy group]]s in degree $k \leq 3$. Therefore every $G$-principal bundle $P$ on the 3-dimensional $\partial \Sigma$ is necessarily trivializable. In this case the [[configuration space]] of the $\sigma$-model is equivalent to the [[groupoid of Lie algebra valued forms]] 

$$
  SmoothGrpd(\partial \Sigma, \mathbf{B}G_{conn})
  \simeq
  \Omega^1(\partial \Sigma, \mathfrak{g})//C^{\infty}(\partial \Sigma,G)
$$ 

on $\partial \Sigma$. For $A \in \Omega^1(\Sigma, \mathrak{g})$ a field configuration and $F_A = d A + \frac{1}{2}[A \wedge A]$ the corresponding curvature 2-form, the curvature 4-form of $\frac{1}{2}\hat \mathbf{p}_1(\phi)$ is $\langle F_A \wedge F_A \rangle$. Its connection 3-form $C$ satisfying $d C = \langle F_A \wedge F_A \rangle$ is -- up to a closed 3-form -- the _[[Chern-Simons form|Chern-Simons 3-form]]_

$$
  C = cs(A) = \langle A \wedge F_A \rangle + \frac{1}{6}\langle A \wedge [A \wedge A]\rangle 
  \,.
$$

Therefore the [[action functional]] of the 3-dimensional $\sigma$-model given by the [[background gauge field]] $\frac{1}{2}\hat \mathbf{p}_1 : \mathbf{B}G_{conn} \to  \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)_{conn}$ is given by

$$
  \exp(i S(-))_{\Sigma_3} : A \mapsto
  \exp(i \int_{\Sigma_3} cs(A))
  \,.
$$

The [[quantum field theory]] defined by this action functional is known as _[[Chern-Simons theory]]_ .

What is called an _$n$-dimensional $\sigma$-model_ is first of all an instance of an $n$-dimensional [[quantum field theory]] (to be explained). The distinctive feature of those quantum field theories that are $\sigma$-models is that 

1. these arise from a simpler kind of field theory -- called a [[classical field theory]] -- by a process called [[quantization]] 

1. moreover, this simpler kind of field theory encoded by[[geometry|geometric data]] in a nice way: it describes physical [[configuration space]]s that are [[mapping space]]s into a [[geometry|geometric]] [[space]] equipped with some [[synthetic differential geometry|differential geometric]] [[structure]].

### Quantum field theory
 {#ExpositionQuantumFieldTheory}

#### Definition

For our purposes here, a [[quantum field theory]] of [[dimension]] $n$ is a [[symmetric monoidal functor]]

$$
  Z : Bord_n^S \to \mathcal{C}
  \,,
$$

where

* $Bord_n^S$ is a [[cobordism category|category of n-dimensional cobordisms]] that are equipped with some [[structure]] $S$; 

  * its [[object]]s are $(n-1)$-[[dimension]]al [[topological manifold]]s;

  * its [[morphism]]s are [[isomorphism class]]es of $n$-[[dimension]]al [[cobordism]]s between such manifolds

  * and all manifolds are equipped with _$S$-[[structure]]_ . For instance $S$ could be _[[Riemannian structure]]_ . Then we would call $Z$ a [[Euclidean quantum field theory]] (confusingly). If $S$ is "no structure" then we call $Z$ a [[topological quantum field theory]].

  * the [[monoidal category]]-structure is given by [[disjoint union]] of manifolds

    $$
      \Sigma_1 \otimes \Sigma_2 := \Sigma_1 \coprod \Sigma_2    
      \,;
    $$

* $\mathcal{C}$ is some [[symmetric monoidal category]].

We think of data as follows:

* $Bord_n^S$ is a model for _being_ and _becoming_ in [[physics]] (following [[Bill Lawvere]]'s terminology): the objects of $Bord_n^S$ are archetypes of _physical spaces that are_ and the morphisms are _physical spaces that evolve_ ;

* the [[object]] $Z(\Sigma)$ that $Z$ assigns to any $(n-1)$-manifold $\Sigma$ is to be thought of as the _[[space]] of all possible [[state]]s_ over the space $\Sigma$ of a the physical system to be modeled;

* so $\mathcal{C}$ is the category of [[n-vector space]]s among which the _spaces of [[state]]s_ of the quantum theory can be picked;

* the [[morphism]] $Z(\hat \Sigma) : Z(\Sigma_{in}) \to Z(\Sigma_{out})$ that $\Sigma$ assigns to any [[cobordism]] $\hat \Sigma$ with incoming [[boundary]] $\Sigma_{in}$ and outgoing boundary $\Sigma_{out}$ is the [[propagator]] along $\hat \Sigma$: it maps every state $\psi \in Z(\Sigma_{in})$ of the system over $\Sigma_{in}$ to the state $Z(\Psi) \in \Sigma_{out}$ that is the result of the evolution of $\psi$ along $\hat \Sigma$ by the _dynamics_ of the system. Or conversely: the action of $Z$ encodes what this dynamics is supposed to be.

Notice that since $Z$ is required to be a symmetric monoidal functor it sends disjoint unions of manifolds to [[tensor product]]s

$$
  F(\Sigma_1 \coprod \Sigma_2) \simeq Z(\Sigma_1) \otimes Z(\Sigma_2)
  \,.
$$

Moreover, for $\hat \Sigma$ a closed [[cobordism]], hence a morphism $\emptyset \stackrel{\hat \Sigma}{\to} \emptyset$ from the [[empty set|empty]] manifold to itself, we have that

* $Z(\emptyset) = \mathbf{1}$ is the tensor unit of $\mathcal{C}$;

* $Z(\hat \Sigma)  \in End(\mathbb{1})$ is an [[endomorphism]] of this tensor unit, a _number_ as seen internal to $\mathcal{C}$ -- this is the _invariant_ associated to $\hat \Sigma$ by $Z$, called the [[partition function]] of $Z$ over $\hat \Sigma$. We can think of $Z$ as being a rule for computing such invariants by building them up from smaller pieces. This is the _locaity_ of quantum field theory.

#### Examples
 {#ExpositionQFTExamples}

* A simple but archetypical example is this: let $S := Riem$ be [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian structure]]. Then the category $Bord_1^{Riem}$ of 1-dimensional cobordisms equipped with Riemannian structure is generated (as a [[symmetric monoidal category]]) from [[interval]]s 

  $$
    \bullet \stackrel{t}{\to} \bullet
  $$

  equipped with a [[length]] $t \in \mathbb{R}_+$. Composition is given by addition of lengths

  $$
    (\bullet \stackrel{t_1}{\to} \bullet \stackrel{t_2}{\to})
    = 
    (\bullet \stackrel{t_1 + t_2}{\to} \bullet)
    \,.
  $$

  Therefore a 1-dimensional [[Euclidean quantum field theory]]

  $$
    Z : Bord_1^{Riem} \to Vect
  $$

  is specified by
  
  * a [[vector space]] $\mathcal{H}$ ("of [[state]]s") assigned to the point;

  * for each $t \in \mathbb{R}_+$ a linear endomorphism

    $$
      U(t) : \mathcal{H} \to \mathcal{H}
    $$

    such that 

    $$  
      U(t_1 + t_2) = U(t_2) \circ U(t_1)
      \,.
    $$

  This is just a system of [[quantum mechanics]]. If we demand that $Z$ respects the [[smooth structure]] on the space of morphisms in $Bord_1^{Riem}$ then there will be a linear map $i H : \mathcal{H} \to \mathcal{H}$ such that

   $$
     U(t) = \exp(i H t)
     \,.
   $$

   This $H$ is called the [[Hamilton operator]] of the system.
   
   (We are glossing here over some technical fine print in the definition of $Bord_1^{Riem}$. Done right we have that $\mathcal{H}$ may indeed be an infinite-dimensional vector space. See [[(1,1)-dimensional Euclidean field theories and K-theory]])

### Classical field theory
 {#ExpositionClassicalFieldTheory}

A special class of examples of $n$-dimensional quantum field theories, as discussed [above](#ExpositionQuantumFieldTheory), arise as [[deformation quantization|deformations]] or _[[path integral|averages]]_ of similar, but simpler structure: _[[classical field theories]]_ . The process that constructs a quantum field theory out of a classical field theory is called _[[quantization]]_ . This is discussed [below](#ExpositionQuantization). Here we describe what a classical field theory is. We shall inevitably oversimplify the situation such as to still count as a leisurely exposition. The kind of examples that the following discussion applies to strictly are field theories <a href="http://nlab.mathforge.org/schreiber/show/infinity-Chern-Simons+theory#DiscreteTargets">of Dijkgraaf-Witten type</a>. But despite its simplicity, this case accurately reflects most of the general abstract properties of the general theory.

For our purposes here, a [[classical field theory]] of dimension $n$ is

* a [[symmetric monoidal functor]]

  $$
    \exp(i S(-)) : Bord_n^S \to Span(Grpd, \mathcal{C})
    \,,
  $$

  where

  * $Bord_n^S$ is the same [[category of cobordisms]] as before;

  * $Span(Grpd, \mathcal{C})$ is the [[category of spans]] of [[groupoid]]s over $\mathcal{C}$:

    * [[object]]s are [[groupoid]]s $K$ equipped with [[functor]]s $\phi : K \to \mathcal{C}$;

    * [[morphism]]s $(K_1, \phi_1) \to (K_2, \phi_2)$ are [[diagram]]s

      $$
        \array{
           && \hat K
           \\
           & \swarrow && \searrow
           \\
           K_1 &&\swArrow&& K_2
           \\
           & \searrow && \swarrow
           \\
           && \mathcal{C}
        }
        \,,
      $$

      where in the middle we have a [[natural transformation]];

    * [[composition]] of morphism is by forming [[2-pullback]]s:

      $$
        (\hat K_2 \circ \hat K_1) = \hat K_1 \prod_{K_2} \hat K_2
        \,.
      $$


Let $\hat \Sigma : \Sigma_1 \to \Sigma_2$ be a [[cobordism]] and

$$
  \exp(i S(-))_{\Sigma} =
  \left(
        \array{
           && Conf_{\hat \Sigma}
           \\
           & {}^{\mathllap{(-)|_{in}}}\swarrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{(-)|_{out}}}
           \\
           Conf_{\Sigma_1} &&\swArrow_{\exp(i S(-)_{\hat \Sigma})}&& Conf_{\Sigma_2}
           \\
           & {}_{V_{\Sigma_1}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{V_{\Sigma_2}}}
           \\
           && \mathcal{C}
        }
  \right)
$$

the value of a classical field theory on $\hat \Sigma$.
We interpret this data as follows:

* $Conf_{\Sigma_1}$ is the [[configuration space]] of a [[classical field theory]] over $\Sigma_1$: [[object]]s are "field configurations" on $\Sigma_1$ and [[morphism]]s are [[gauge transformation]]s between these. Similarly for $Conf_{\Sigma_2}$.

  Here a "physical field" can be something like the [[electromagnetic field]]. But it can also be something very different. For the special case of $\sigma$-models that we are eventually getting at, a "field configuration" here will instead be a way of an particle of shape $\Sigma_1$ sitting in some [[target space]].

* $Conf_{\hat \Sigma}$ is similarly the groupoid of field configurations on the whole cobordism, $\hat \Sigma$. If we think of an object in $Conf_{\hat \Sigma}$ of a way of a [[brane]] of shape $\Sigma_1$ sitting in some [[target space]], then an object in $Conf_{\hat Sigma}$ is a _trajectory_ of that brane in that target space, along which it evolves from shape $\Sigma_1$ to shape $\Sigma_2$.

* $V_{\Sigma_i} : Conf_{\Sigma_i} \to \mathcal{C}$ is the [[classifying space|classifying map]] of a kind of [[vector bundle]] over configuration space: a [[state]] $\psi \in Z(\Sigma_1)$ of the [[quantum field theory]] that will be associated to this [[classical field theory]] by [[quantization]] will be a [[section]] of this vector bundle. Such a section is to be thought of as a generalization of a 
[[probability distribution]] on the space of classical field configurations. The [[generalized element]]s of a [[fiber]] $V_{c}$ of $V_{\Sigma_1}$ over a configuration $c \in Conf_{\Sigma_1}$ may be thought of as an _internal state_ of the brane of shape $\Sigma_1$ sitting in target space. 

* $\exp(i S(-))_{\hat \Sigma}$ is the [[action functional]] that defines the classical field theory: the component

  $$
   \exp(i S(\gamma))_{\hat \Sigma} 
    : 
    V_{\gamma|_{in}}
    \to
    V_{\gamma|_{out}}
  $$

 of this [[natural transformation]] on a trajectory $\gamma \in Conf_{\hat \Sigma}$ going from a configuration $\gamma|_{in}$ to a configuration $\gamma|_{out}$ is a morphism in $\mathcal{C}$ that maps the internal states of the ingoing configuration $\gamma|_{\Sigma_1}$ to the internal states of the outgoing configuration $\gamma|_{\Sigma_2}$. This evolution of internal states encodes the _classical dynamics_ of the system.
 
Notice that this way a classical field theory is taken to be a special case of a [quantum field theory](#ExpositionQuantumFieldTheory), where the codomain of the symmetric monoidal functor is of the special form $Span(Grpd, \mathcal{C})$. For more on this see [[classical field theory as quantum field theory]].

### Quantization
 {#ExpositionQuantization}

We assume now that $\mathcal{C}$ has [[colimit]]s and in fact [[biproduct]]s.

Then for every [[functor]] $\phi : K \to \mathcal{C}$ the [[colimit]] 

$$
  \int^{K} \phi \in \mathcal{C}
$$

exists, and (using the existence of [[biproduct]]s) this construction extends to a [[functor]]

$$
  \int : Span(Grpd, \mathcal{C}) \to \mathcal{C}
  \,.
$$

We call this the _[[path integral]]_ functor.

For

$$
  \exp(i S(-)) : Bord_n^S \to Span(Grpd, \mathcal{C})
$$

a [classical field theory](#ExpositionClassicalFieldTheory), we get this way a [quantum field theory](#ExpositionQuantumFieldTheory) by forming the composite functor

$$
  Z 
    := 
  \int \circ \exp(i S(-)) 
   : 
  Bord_n^S 
    \stackrel{\exp(i S(-))}{\to}
  Span(Grpd, \mathcal{C})
    \stackrel{\int}{\to}
  \mathcal{C}
  \,.
$$

This $Z$ we call the _[[quantization]]_ of $\exp(i S(-))$.

It acts

* on [[object]]s by sending

  $$
    \begin{aligned}
      \Sigma_{in} & \mapsto (V_{\Sigma_{in}} : Conf_{\Sigma_{in}} \to \mathcal{C}) 
      \\
      & \mapsto \mathcal{H}_{\Sigma_{in}} := \int^K V_{\Sigma_{in}}
    \end{aligned}
  $$

  the vector bundle on the [[configuration space]] over some boundary $\Sigma_{in}$ of [[worldvolume]] to its space $\mathcal{H}_{\Sigma_{in}}$ of [[gauge transformation|gauge invariant]] [[section]]s. In typical situations this $\mathcal{H}_{\Sigma_{in}}$ is the famous [[Hilbert space]] of [[state]]s in [[quantum mechanics]], only that here it is allowed to be any object in $\mathcal{C}$;

* on [[morphism]]s by sending a [[natural transformation]]

  $$
    \begin{aligned}   
      \hat \Sigma & \mapsto 
       (\exp(i S(-))_{\hat \Sigma} : \gamma \mapsto 
       V_{\gamma|_{in}} \to V_{\gamma|_{out}})
       \\   
       & \mapsto
       (\int^K \exp(i S(-))_{\hat \Sigma} 
        : 
        \mathcal{H}_{\Sigma_1} \to \mathcal{H}_{\Sigma_2}
       )
    \end{aligned}
  $$

  to the [[integral transform]] that it defines, weighted by the [[groupoid cardinality]] of $Conf_{\hat \Sigma}$ : the _[[path integral]]_ .


### Classical $\sigma$-models
 {#ExpositionClassicalSigmaModels}


A _classical $\sigma$-model_ is a [classical field theory](#ExpositionClassicalFieldTheory) such that

* the [[configuration space]]s $Conf_{\Sigma}$ are [[mapping spaces]] $\mathbf{H}(\Sigma,X)$ in some suitable category -- some [[cohesive (infinity,1)-topos|higher topos]] in fact -- , for $X$ some fixed [[object]] of that category called _[[target space]]_ ;
 
* the bundles $V_{\Sigma} : Conf_{\Sigma} \to \mathcal{C}$ "of internal states" over these mapping spaces are 

  * the [[transgression]] to these [[mapping space]]s...

  * ...of an [[associated infinity-bundle|associated higher bundle]]... 

  * ...asscociated to a [[circle n-bundle with connection]] on [[target space]]...

  * ...encoded by a classifying morphism

    $$
      \alpha : X \to \mathbf{B}^{n} U(1)
    $$

    into the [[circle n-group]] in $\mathbf{H}$; equipped with an [[connection on an infinity-bundle|n-connection]] $\nabla$...

  * ...where the [[associated bundle|association]] is via a [[representation]]

    $$
      \rho : \mathbf{B}^{n+1} U(1) \to (n+1) Vect
    $$

    on [[n-vector spaces]], which is usually taken to be the canonical 1-dimensional one.

  One calls $(\alpha,\nabla)$ the [[background gauge field]] of the $\sigma$-model.

* The [[action functional]]s $\exp(i S(-))_{\hat \Sigma}$ are given by the [[higher parallel transport]] of $\nabla$ over $\hat \Sigma$.

So an $n$-dimensional $\sigma$-model is a classical field theory that is [[representable functor|represented]], in a sense, by a [[circle n-bundle with connection]] on some [[target space]].

More specifically and more simply, in cases where $X$ is just a [[discrete ∞-groupoid]]  -- the case of  <a href="http://nlab.mathforge.org/schreiber/show/infinity-Chern-Simons%20theory#DiscreteTargets">sigma-models of Dijkgraaf-Witten type</a>, every [[principal ∞-bundle]] on $X$ is necessarily <a href="http://nlab.mathforge.org/nlab/show/cohesive+%28infinity%2C1%29-topos%20--%20structures#FlatDifferentialCohomology">flat</a>, hence the [[background gauge field]] is given just by the morphism

$$
  \alpha : X \to \mathbf{B}^{n} U(1)
  \,.
$$

Then for $\hat \Sigma$ a closed $n$-dimensional manifold, the [[action functional]] of the sigma-model on $\Sigma$ on a field configuration $\gamma : \hat \Sigma \to X$ has the value

$$
  \exp(i S(\gamma))_{\hat \Sigma}
  = 
  \int_{\hat \Sigma} [\alpha]
$$

being the evaluation of $[\alpha]$ regarded as a class in [[ordinary cohomology]] $H^n(\hat \Sigma, U(1))$ evaluated on the [[fundamental class]] of $X$. 

One says that $[\alpha]$ is the [[Lagrangian]] of the theory.


### Quantum $\sigma$-models
 {#ExpositionQuantumSigmaModels} 

(...)

## Examples 

### Non-topological $\sigma$-models 

* The canonical textbook example of a quantum mechanical system is of this form for $n=1$: A line [[vector bundle|bundle]] with [[connection on a bundle|connection]] $E \to X$ on a ([[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo-]])[[Riemannian manifold]] $X$ induces the 1-dimensional [[quantum field theory]] which is the quantum mechanics of a point particle which propagates on $X$, subject to the forces of [[gravity]] (given by the [[pseudo-Riemannian metric]] on $X$) and [[electromagnetism]] (given by the line bundle with connection). The [[Hamilton operator]] encoding this quantum dynamics in this case is the Laplace-operator of $T X$ twisted by the line bundle $E$.

  For $X$ a [[spacetime]] this is called the [[relativistic particle]].

  For $\Sigma$ or $X$ a [[supermanifold]] this is the [[superparticle]].

* Generalizing in the above example the line bundle $E$ by an abelian [[bundle gerbe]] with a connection yields a background for a 2-dimensional $\sigma$-model which mayb be thought of as describing the propgation of a [[string theory|string]].  The best-studied version of this is the case where $X = G$ is a [[Lie group]], in which case this $\sigma$-model is known as the _[[WZW model|Wess--Zumino--Witten model]]_.



### Topological $\sigma$-models 


* [[Dijkgraaf-Witten theory]] is the (2+1)-dimensioanl $\sigma$-model induced from an abelian 2-gerbe on $\mathbf{B} G$, for $G$ a finite group.

* [[Chern-Simons theory]] is supposed to be analogously the $\sigma$-model induced from an abelian 2-gerbe with connection on $\mathbf{B}G$, but now for $G$ a Lie group.

* the [[Poisson sigma-model]] is a model whose target is a [[Poisson Lie algebroid]].

* in [[AKSZ theory]] this is generalized to a large class of sigma models with [[symplectic Lie n-algebroid]]s as target.

* Rozansky--Witten theory is essentially the $\sigma$-model for $X$ a smooth projective variety.

* generally [[schreiber:∞-Chern-Simons theory]] is a $\sigma$-model with a [[smooth ∞-groupoid]] of [[connection on an ∞-bundle|∞-connections]].
