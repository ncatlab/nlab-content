#Idea#

A _$\sigma$-model_ is a [[quantum field theory]]  which is indced from a _target space_ that carries some geometric structure, usually that of an [[schreiber:Differential Nonabelian Cohomology|n-bundle with connection]] representing a gauge background field.

The _fields_ of a $\sigma$-model on parameter space $\Sigma$ are maps from $\Sigma$ to target space $X$.

One way to make this precise for _topological_ $\sigma$-models is to say that target soace $X$, or possibly the gauge bundle $P \to X$ over it, [[representable functor|represents]] an functor that sends [[cobordism]] [[cospan]]s to [[span]]s which in turn are taken to act by pull-push on the quantum states, which are objects in [[geometric infinity-function theory]] living over the mapping spaces $[\Sigma, P]$.

## Physical interpretation ##

$\sigma$-model quantum field theories on parameter spaces $\Sigma$ of top dimension $n+1$ are to be thought of as encoding the quantum mechanics of the propagation of an $n$-dimensional particle, called an _$n$-brane_, in target space $X$, subject to the forces imposed on it by the backgreound field, under which it is said to be charged.


These cases describe non-topological quantum field theories. Here the formalization of the notion of $\sigma$-model is not entirely complete. Yet 

#Examples#

## Non-topological $\sigma$-models ##

* The canonical textbook example of a quantum mechanical system is of this form for $n=1$: A line bundle with connection $E \to X$ on a Riemannian manifold $X$ induces the 1-dimensional quantum field theory which is the quantum mechanics of a point particle which propagates on $X$, subject to the forces of gravitation (given by the metrix on $X$) and electromagnetism (given by the line bundle with connection). The Hamilton operator encoding this quantum dynamics in this case is the Laplace-operator of $T X$ twisted by the line bundle $E$.

* Generalizing in the above example the line bundle $E$ by an abelian gerbe with a connection yields a background for a 2-dimensional $\sigma$-model which mayb be thought of as describing the propgation of a string.  The best-studied version of this is the case where $X = G$ is a Lie group, in which case this $\sigma$-model is known as the _Wess-Zumino-Witten model_.



## Topological $\sigma$-models ##

* Dijkgraaf-Witten theory is the (2+1)-dimensioanl $\sigma$-model induced from an abelian 2-gerbe on $\mathbf{B} G$, for $G$ a finite group.

* Chern-Simons theory is supposed to be analogously the $\sigma$-model induced from an abelian 2-gerbe with connection on $\mathbf{B}G$, but now for $G$ a Lie group.

* Rozansky-Witten theory is essentially the $\sigma$-model for $X$ a smooth projective variety.
