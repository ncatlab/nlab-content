## Idea

A _$\sigma$-model_ is a [[quantum field theory]]  whose fields are maps from a _[[worldvolume]]_ $\Sigma$ into some _[[target space]]_ that carries some geometric structure -- usually a [[background gauge field]] given by a [[connection on an infinity-bundle]] generally or a cocycle in abelian [[differential cohomology]] more specifically.

One way to make this precise for _topological_ $\sigma$-models is to say that target space $X$, or possibly the gauge bundle $P \to X$ over it, [[representable functor|represents]] an functor that sends [[cobordism]] [[cospan]]s to [[span]]s which in turn are taken to act by pull-push on the quantum states, which are objects in [[geometric infinity-function theory]] living over the mapping spaces $[\Sigma, P]$. (...)

### Physical interpretation 

$\sigma$-model quantum field theories on [[worldvolume]] $\Sigma$ of top dimension $n+1$ are to be thought of as encoding the quantum mechanics of the propagation of an $n$-dimensional particle, called an _$(n-1)$-[[brane]]_, in [[target space]] $X$, subject to [[force]]s imposed on it by the [[background gauge field]], under which it is said to be _[[charge]]d_.

These cases describe non-topological quantum field theories. Here the formalization of the notion of $\sigma$-model is not entirely complete. Yet.

### Terminology and history
 {#TerminologyAndHistory}

In physics one tends to speak of a _model_ if one specifies a particular [[quantum field theory]] for describing a particular situation, for instance by specifying a [[Lagrangian]] or [[local action functional]] on some [[configuration space]]. This is traditionally not meant in the mathematical sense of _[[model]]_ of some [[theory]]. But in light of progress of mathematically formalizing [[quantum field theory]] (see [[FQFT]] and [[AQFT]]), it can with hindsight be interpreted in this way: 

a $\sigma$-model is supposed to be a type of [[model]] for the [[theory]] called [[quantum field theory]]. This sounds like a tautology, but much effort in mathematical physics is devoted to eventually making this a precise statement. In special cases and toy examples this has been achieved, but for the examples that seem to be directly relevant for the phenomenological description of the observed world, lots of clues still seem to be missing.

As to the "$\sigma$" in "$\sigma$-model": back in the 1960s people were interested in a hypothetical particle called the 
$\sigma$-particle.  [[Murray Gell-Mann]] came up with a theory of them.  It was called ‘the $\sigma$-model’.  It was an old-fashioned field theory where the field took values in a vector space.   Then someone came up with a modified version of the σ-model where the field took values in some other [[manifold]] and this was called ‘the nonlinear σ-model’.  

While the parameter space (the domain space of the fields) of the original $\sigma$-models was supposed to be our [[spacetime]] and the target space was some abstract space, with the advent of [[string theory]] the nonlinear $\sigma$-models gained importance as quantum field theories whose _target space_ is [[spacetime]] $X$ and whose parameter space is some low dimensional space, usually denoted $\Sigma$. A field configuration $\Sigma \to X$ is then interpreted as being the trajectory of an extended fundamental particle -- a fundamental [[brane]] -- in $X$, and the $\sigma$-model describes the quantum mechanics of that brane propagating in $X$.

In particular the [[quantum mechanics]] of a [[relativistic particle]] propagating on $X$ is described by a $\sigma$-model on the [[real line]] $\Sigma = \mathbb{R}$ -- the _worldline_ of the particle.

In [[string theory]] one considers 2-[[dimensional]] $\Sigma$ and thinks of maps $\Sigma \to X$ as being the _worldsheets_ of the trajectory of a string propagating in spacetime.

In the context of [[11-dimensional supergravity]] there is a $\sigma$-model with 3-dimensional $\Sigma$, describing the propagation of a [[membrane]] in [[spacetime]].

## Exposition
 {#Exposition}

We give a leisurely exposition of the idea of $\sigma$-models, aimed at readers with a background in [[category theory]] but trying to assume no other prerequisites.

What is called an _$n$-dimensional $\sigma$-model_ is first of all an instance of an $n$-dimensional [[quantum field theory]] (to be explained). The distinctive feature of those quantum field theories that are $\sigma$-models is that 

1. these arise from a simpler kind of field theory -- called a [[classical field theory]] -- by a process called [[quantization]] 

1. moreover, this simpler kind of field theory encoded by[[geometry|geometric data]] in a nice way: it describes physical [[configuration space]]s that are [[mapping space]]s into a [[geometry|geometric]] [[space]] equipped with some [[synthetic differential geometry|differential geometric]] [[structure]].

We give expositions of these items step-by-step:

1. [Quantum field theory](#ExpositionQuantumFieldTheory)

1. [Classical field theory](#ExpositionClassicalFieldTheory)

1. [Quantization](#ExpositionQuantization)

1. [Classical sigma-models](#ExpositionClassicalSigmaModels)

1. [Quantum sigma-models](#ExpositionQuantumSigmaModels)

### Quantum field theory
 {#ExpositionQuantumFieldTheory}

For our purposes here, a [[quantum field theory]] of [[dimension]] $n$ is a [[symmetric monoidal functor]]

$$
  Z : Bord_n^S \to \mathcal{C}
  \,,
$$

where

* $Bord_n^S$ is a [[cobordism category|category of n-dimensional cobordisms]] that are equipped with some [[structure]] $S$: 

  * its [[object]]s are $(n-1)$-[[dimension]]al [[topological manifold]]s;

  * its [[morphism]]s are [[isomorphism class]]es of $n$-[[dimension]]al [[cobordism]]s between such manifolds

  * and all manifolds are equipped with _$S$-[[structure]]_ . For instance $S$ could be _[[Riemannian structure]]_ . Then we would call $Z$ a [[Euclidean quantum field theory]] (confusingly). If $S$ is "no structure" then we call $Z$ a [[topological quantum field theory]].

* $\mathcal{C}$ is some [[symmetric monoidal category]].

We think of data as follows:

* $Bord_n^S$ is a model for _being_ and _becoming_ in [[physics]] (following [[Bill Lawvere]]'s terminology): the objects of $Bord_n^S$ are archetypes of _physical spaces that are_ and the morphisms are _physical spaces that evolve_ ;

* the [[object]] $Z(\Sigma)$ that $Z$ assigns to any $(n-1)$-manifold $\Sigma$ is to be thought of as the _[[space]] of all possible [[state]]s_ over the space $\Sigma$ of a the physical system to be modeled;

* the [[morphism]] $Z(\hat \Sigma) : Z(\Sigma_{in}) \to Z(\Sigma_{out})$ that $\Sigma$ assigns to any [[cobordism]] $\hat \Sigma$ with incoming [[boundary]] $\Sigma_{in}$ and outgoing boundary $\Sigma_{out}$ is the [[propagator]] along $\hat \Sigma$: it maps every state $\psi \in Z(\Sigma_{in})$ of the system over $\Sigma_{in}$ to the state $Z(\Psi) \in \Sigma_{out}$ that is the result of the evolution of $\psi$ along $\hat \Sigma$ by the _dynamics_ of the system. Or conversely: the action of $Z$ encodes what this dynamics is supposed to be.


### Classical field theory
 {#ExpositionClassicalFieldTheory}

A special class of examples of $n$-dimensional quantum field theories, as discussed [above](#ExpositionQuantumFieldTheory), arise as [[deformation quantization|deformations]] or _[[path integral|averages]]_ of similar, but simpler structure: _[[classical field theories]]_ . The process that constructs a quantum field theory out of a classical field theory is called _[[quantization]]_ . This is discussed [below](#ExpositionQuantization). Here we describe what a classical field theory is. We shall inevitably oversimplify the situation such as to still count as a leisurely exposition. The kind of examples that the following discussion applies to strictly are field theories <a href="http://nlab.mathforge.org/schreiber/show/infinity-Chern-Simons+theory#DiscreteTargets">of Dijkgraaf-Witten type</a>. But despite its simplicity, this case accurately reflects most of the general abstract properties of the general theory.

For our purposes here, a [[classical field theory]] of dimension $n$ is

* a [[symmetric monoidal functor]]

  $$
    \exp(i S(-)) : Bord_n^S \to Span(Grpd, \mathcal{C})
    \,,
  $$

  where

  * $Bord_n^S$ is the same [[category of cobordisms]] as before;

  * $Span(Grpd, \mathcal{C})$ is the [[category of spans]] of [[groupoid]]s over $\mathcal{C}$:

    * [[object]]s are [[groupoid]]s $K$ equipped with [[functor]]s $\phi : K \to \mathcal{C}$;

    * [[morphism]]s $(K_1, \phi_1) \to (K_2, \phi_2)$ are [[diagram]]s

      $$
        \array{
           && \hat K
           \\
           & \swarrow && \searrow
           \\
           K_1 &&\swArrow&& K_2
           \\
           & \searrow && \swarrow
           \\
           && \mathcal{C}
        }
        \,,
      $$

      where in the middle we have a [[natural transformation]];

    * [[composition]] of morphism is by forming [[2-pullback]]s:

      $$
        (\hat K_2 \circ \hat K_1) = \hat K_1 \prod_{K_2} \hat K_2
        \,.
      $$


Let $\hat \Sigma : \Sigma_1 \to \Sigma_2$ be a [[cobordism]] and

$$
  \exp(i S(-))_{\Sigma} =
  \left(
        \array{
           && Conf_{\hat \Sigma}
           \\
           & {}^{\mathllap{(-)|_{in}}}\swarrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{(-)|_{out}}}
           \\
           Conf_{\Sigma_1} &&\swArrow_{\exp(i S(-)_{\hat \Sigma})}&& Conf_{\Sigma_2}
           \\
           & {}_{V_{\Sigma_1}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{V_{\Sigma_2}}}
           \\
           && \mathcal{C}
        }
  \right)
$$

the value of a classical field theory on $\hat \Sigma$.
We interpret this data as follows:

* $Conf_{\Sigma_1}$ is the [[configuration space]] of a [[classical field theory]] over $\Sigma_1$: [[object]]s are "field configurations" on $\Sigma_1$ and [[morphism]]s are [[gauge transformation]]s between these. Similarly for $Conf_{\Sigma_2}$.

  Here a "physical field" can be something like the [[electromagnetic field]]. But it can also be something very different. For the special case of $\sigma$-models that we are eventually getting at, a "field configuration" here will instead be a way of an particle of shape $\Sigma_1$ sitting in some [[target space]].

* $Conf_{\hat \Sigma}$ is similarly the groupoid of field configurations on the whole cobordism, $\hat \Sigma$. If we think of an object in $Conf_{\hat \Sigma}$ of a way of a [[brane]] of shape $\Sigma_1$ sitting in some [[target space]], then an object in $Conf_{\hat Sigma}$ is a _trajectory_ of that brane in that target space, along which it evolves from shape $\Sigma_1$ to shape $\Sigma_2$.

* $V_{\Sigma_i} : Conf_{\Sigma_i} \to \mathcal{C}$ is the [[classifying space|classifying map]] of a kind of [[vector bundle]] over configuration space: a [[state]] $\psi \in Z(\Sigma_1)$ of the [[quantum field theory]] that will be associated to this [[classical field theory]] by [[quantization]] will be a [[section]] of this vector bundle. Such a section is to be thought of as a generalization of a 
[[probability distribution]] on the space of classical field configurations. The [[generalized element]]s of a [[fiber]] $V_{c}$ of $V_{\Sigma_1}$ over a configuration $c \in Conf_{\Sigma_1}$ may be thought of as an _internal state_ of the brane of shape $\Sigma_1$ sitting in target space. 

* $\exp(i S(-))_{\hat \Sigma}$ is the [[action functional]] that defines the classical field theory: the component

  $$
   \exp(i S(\gamma))_{\hat \Sigma} 
    : 
    V_{\gamma|_{in}}
    \to
    V_{\gamma|_{out}}
  $$

 of this [[natural transformation]] on a trajectory $\gamma \in Conf_{\hat \Sigma}$ going from a configuration $\gamma|_{in}$ to a configuration $\gamma|_{out}$ is a morphism in $\mathcal{C}$ that maps the internal states of the ingoing configuration $\gamma|_{\Sigma_1}$ to the internal states of the outgoing configuration $\gamma|_{\Sigma_2}$. This evolution of internal states encodes the _classical dynamics_ of the system.
 

### Quantization
 {#ExpositionQuantization}

We assume now that $\mathcal{C}$ has [[colimit]]s and in fact [[biproduct|bilimits]].

Then for every [[functor]] $\phi : K \to \mathcal{C}$ the [[colimit]] 

$$
  \int^{K} \phi \in \mathcal{C}
$$

exists, and this construction extends to a [[functor]]

$$
  \int : Span(Grpd, \mathcal{C}) \to \mathcal{C}
  \,.
$$

We call this the _[[path integral]]_ functor.

For

$$
  \exp(i S(-)) : Bord_n^S \to Span(Grpd, \mathcal{C})
$$

a [classical field theory](#ExpositionClassicalFieldTheory), we get this way a [quantum field theory](#ExpositionQuantumFieldTheory) by forming the composite functor

$$
  Z 
    := 
  \int \circ \exp(i S(-)) 
   : 
  Bord_n^S 
    \stackrel{\exp(i S(-))}{\to}
  Span(Grpd, \mathcal{C})
    \stackrel{\int}{\to}
  \mathcal{C}
  \,.
$$

This $Z$ we call the _[[quantization]]_ of $\exp(i S(-))$.

It acts

* on [[object]]s by sending

  $$
    \begin{aligned}
      \Sigma_{in} & \mapsto (V_{\Sigma_{in}} : Conf_{\Sigma_{in}} \to \mathcal{C}) 
      \\
      & \mapsto \mathcal{H}_{\Sigma_{in}} := \int^K V_{\Sigma_{in}}
    \end{aligned}
  $$

  the vector bundle on the [[configuration space]] over some boundary $\Sigma_{in}$ of [[worldvolume]] to its space $\mathcal{H}_{\Sigma_{in}}$ of [[gauge transformation|gauge invariant]] [[section]]s. In typical situations this $\mathcal{H}_{\Sigma_{in}}$ is the famous [[Hilbert space]] of [[state]]s in [[quantum mechanics]], only that here it is allowed to be any object in $\mathcal{C}$;

* on [[morphism]]s by sending a [[natural transformation]]

  $$
    \begin{aligned}   
      \hat \Sigma & \mapsto 
       (\exp(i S(-))_{\hat \Sigma} : \gamma \mapsto 
       V_{\gamma|_{in}} \to V_{\gamma|_{out}})
       \\   
       & \mapsto
       (\int^K \exp(i S(-))_{\hat \Sigma} 
        : 
        \mathcal{H}_{\Sigma_1} \to \mathcal{H}_{\Sigma_2}
       )
    \end{aligned}
  $$

  to the [[integral transform]] that it defines, weighted by the [[groupoid cardinality]] of $Conf_{\hat \Sigma}$ : the _[[path integral]]_ .


### Classical $\sigma$-models
 {#ExpositionClassicalSigmaModels}


A _classical $\sigma$-model_ is a [classical field theory](#ExpositionClassicalFieldTheory) such that

* the [[configuration space]]s $Conf_{\Sigma}$ are [[mapping spaces]] $\mathbf{H}(\Sigma,X)$ in some suitable category -- some [[cohesive (infinity,1)-topos|higher topos]] in fact -- , for $X$ some fixed [[object]] of that category called _[[target space]]_ ;
 
* the bundles $V_{\Sigma} : Conf_{\Sigma} \to \mathcal{C}$ "of internal states" over these mapping spaces are 

  * the [[transgression]] to these [[mapping space]]s...

  * ...of an [[associated infinity-bundle|associated higher bundle]]... 

  * ...asscociated to a [[circle n-bundle with connection]] on [[target space]]...

  * ...encoded by a classifying morphism

    $$
      \alpha : X \to \mathbf{B}^{n} U(1)
    $$

    into the [[circle n-group]] in $\mathbf{H}$; equipped with an [[connection on an infinity-bundle|n-connection]] $\nabla$...

  * ...where the [[associated bundle|association]] is via a [[representation]]

    $$
      \rho : \mathbf{B}^{n+1} U(1) \to (n+1) Vect
    $$

    on [[n-vector spaces]], which is usually taken to be the canonical 1-dimensional one.

  One calls $(\alpha,\nabla)$ the [[background gauge field]] of the $\sigma$-model.

* The [[action functional]]s $\exp(i S(-))_{\hat \Sigma}$ are given by the [[higher parallel transport]] of $\nabla$ over $\hat \Sigma$.

So an $n$-dimensional $\sigma$-model is a classical field theory that is [[representable functor|represented]], in a sense, by a [[circle n-bundle with connection]] on some [[target space]].

More specifically and more simply, in cases where $X$ is just a [[discrete ∞-groupoid]]  -- the case of  <a href="http://nlab.mathforge.org/schreiber/show/infinity-Chern-Simons%20theory#DiscreteTargets">sigma-models of Dijkgraaf-Witten type</a>, every [[principal ∞-bundle]] on $X$ is necessarily <a href="http://nlab.mathforge.org/nlab/show/cohesive+%28infinity%2C1%29-topos%20--%20structures#FlatDifferentialCohomology">flat</a>, hence the [[background gauge field]] is given just by the morphism

$$
  \alpha : X \to \mathbf{B}^{n} U(1)
  \,.
$$

Then for $\hat \Sigma$ a closed $n$-dimensional manifold, the [[action functional]] of the sigma-model on $\Sigma$ on a field configuration $\gamma : \hat \Sigma \to X$ has the value

$$
  \exp(i S(\gamma))_{\hat \Sigma}
  = 
  \int_{\hat \Sigma} [\alpha]
$$

being the evaluation of $[\alpha]$ regarded as a class in [[ordinary cohomology]] $H^n(\hat \Sigma, U(1))$ evaluated on the [[fundamental class]] of $X$. 

One says that $[\alpha]$ is the [[Lagrangian]] of the theory.


### Quantum $\sigma$-models
 {#ExpositionQuantumSigmaModels} 

(...)

## Examples 

### Non-topological $\sigma$-models 

* The canonical textbook example of a quantum mechanical system is of this form for $n=1$: A line [[vector bundle|bundle]] with [[connection on a bundle|connection]] $E \to X$ on a ([[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo-]])[[Riemannian manifold]] $X$ induces the 1-dimensional [[quantum field theory]] which is the quantum mechanics of a point particle which propagates on $X$, subject to the forces of [[gravity]] (given by the [[pseudo-Riemannian metric]] on $X$) and [[electromagnetism]] (given by the line bundle with connection). The [[Hamilton operator]] encoding this quantum dynamics in this case is the Laplace-operator of $T X$ twisted by the line bundle $E$.

  For $X$ a [[spacetime]] this is called the [[relativistic particle]].

  For $\Sigma$ or $X$ a [[supermanifold]] this is the [[superparticle]].

* Generalizing in the above example the line bundle $E$ by an abelian [[bundle gerbe]] with a connection yields a background for a 2-dimensional $\sigma$-model which mayb be thought of as describing the propgation of a [[string theory|string]].  The best-studied version of this is the case where $X = G$ is a [[Lie group]], in which case this $\sigma$-model is known as the _[[WZW model|Wess--Zumino--Witten model]]_.



### Topological $\sigma$-models 


* [[Dijkgraaf-Witten theory]] is the (2+1)-dimensioanl $\sigma$-model induced from an abelian 2-gerbe on $\mathbf{B} G$, for $G$ a finite group.

* [[Chern-Simons theory]] is supposed to be analogously the $\sigma$-model induced from an abelian 2-gerbe with connection on $\mathbf{B}G$, but now for $G$ a Lie group.

* the [[Poisson sigma-model]] is a model whose target is a [[Poisson Lie algebroid]].

* in [[AKSZ theory]] this is generalized to a large class of sigma models with [[symplectic Lie n-algebroid]]s as target.

* Rozansky--Witten theory is essentially the $\sigma$-model for $X$ a smooth projective variety.

* generally [[schreiber:∞-Chern-Simons theory]] is a $\sigma$-model with a [[smooth ∞-groupoid]] of [[connection on an ∞-bundle|∞-connections]].
