## Idea

Given a [[semisimple Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ over a field $F$ with [[Borel subalgebra]] $\mathfrak{b}\subset\mathfrak{g}$ a _Verma module_ is the [[induced module]]
$$
U(\mathfrak{g})\otimes_{U(\mathfrak{b})} F_\lambda
$$
where $F_\lambda$ is one dimensional [[representation]] of $U(\mathfrak{b})$ corresponding to the [[character]] $\lambda$ of $\mathfrak{b}$.

This construction is used also for many other Lie algebras with triangular decomposition, for quantized enveloping algebras and many other generalizations.
