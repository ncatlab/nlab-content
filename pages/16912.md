## Idea

The construction that sends a [[smooth manifold]] $X$ to the [[algebraic K-theory]] [[spectrum]] $K(C^\infty(X,\mathbb{C}))$ of its [[ring]] of [[smooth functions]] (with values in the [[complex numbers]]) presents (after [[infinity-stackification]]) a [[sheaf of spectra]] on the [[site]] of [[smooth manifolds]], hence a [[smooth spectrum]]

$$
  \mathbf{K} \in Stab(Smooth\infty Grpd) \simeq T_\ast Smooth \infty Grpd
  \,,
$$

i.e. an object of the [[tangent cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] of [[Smooth∞Grpd]].

The [[shape modality|shape]] of this $\mathbf{K}$ is the [[topological K-theory]] spectrum $ku$ ([Bunke 14, (48) with def. 2.21](#Bunke14)):

$$
  &#643; \mathbf{K} \simeq ku
  \,.
$$

Hence $\mathbf{K}$ is a [[differential cohomology]] refinement of $ku$, a form of [[differential K-theory]].

There is also the more standard [[differential K-theory]] refinement $\mathbf{ku}_{conn}$ of $ku$ ([[Quadratic Functions in Geometry, Topology, and M-Theory|Hopkins-Singer 05]], [Bunke-Nikolaus-Voelkl 13](differential+K-theory#BunkeNikolausVoelkl13)) which is obtained by pulling back suitable sheaves of ($\mathbb{C}$-valued) [[differential forms]] $\mathbf{DD}^-$ along the usual  [[Chern character map]] $ch \colon ku \longrightarrow DD^{per}$. This Chern character lifts through the [[shape modality]] to a [[regulator]] map ([Bunke 14, (50)](#Bunke14))

$$
  \array{
    \mathbf{K} &\stackrel{\mathbf{reg}}{\longrightarrow}& \mathbf{DD}^-
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\eta^{&#643;}}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\eta^{&#643;}}}
    \\
    ku &\stackrel{ch}{\longrightarrow}& DD^{per}
  }
$$

Moreover, this induces a differential regulator ([Bunke 14, def. 2.29](#Bunke14))

$$
  \mathbf{reg}_{conn} \;\colon\; \mathbf{K} \longrightarrow \mathbf{ku}_{conn}
  \,.
$$

(In ([Bunke 14](#Bunke14)) everything is crossed with a fixed manifold $X$. We are displaying the case that $X = \ast$).
