## Idea

_Modal type theory_ is a flavor of [[type theory]] with [[type formation rules]] for [[modalities]], hence [[type theory]] which on [[propositions]] reduces to [[modal logic]]. 

Following ([Moggi91](#Moggi91), [Benton-Bierman-de Paiva 95](#BentonBiermanPaiva), [Kobayashi 97](#Kobayashi)) modal type theory  is specifically understood as being a type theory equipped with  ([[comonad|co-]])[[monads]] on its type system, representing the intended [[modalities]]. Since [[monad (in computer science)|monads in computer science]] embody a notion of [[computation]], some authors also speak of _[[computational type theory]]_ here ([Benton-Bierman-de Paiva 95](#BentonBiermanPaiva), [Fairtlough-Mendler 02](#FairtloughMendler02)).

According to ([Benton-Bierman-de Paiva 95, p. 1-2](#BentonBiermanPaiva)) this matches well with the default interpretation of ([[S4]]) [[modal logic]] as being about the [[modality]] $T$ of "[[possibility]]":

> The starting point for Moggi's work is an explicit semantic distinction between _computations_ and _values_. If $A$ is an object which interprets the values of a particular type, then $T(A)$ is the object which models computation of that type $A$. $[...]$ For a wide variety of notions of computation, the unary operator $T(-)$ turns out to have the categorical structure of a _strong monad_ on an underlying cartesian closed category of values. $[...]$ On a purely intuitive level and particularly if one thinks about non-termination, there is certainly something appealing about the idea that a computation of type $A$ represents the possibility of a value of type $A$.


When the underlying type theory is [[homotopy type theory]] these modalities are a "higher" generalization of traditional modalities, with "higher" in the sense of [[higher category theory]]: they have [[categorical semantics]] in [[(∞,1)-categories]] given by [[(∞,1)-monads]]. See ([Shulman 12](#Shulman),  [Rijke, Shulman, Spitters](#RSS) ) for definition of such _higher modalities_, and see at _[[reflective subuniverse]]_.


## Properties

### Relation to monads
 {#RelationToMonads}

At least in many cases, modalities in type theory are identified with [[monads (in computer science)|monads]] or comonads on the underlying [[type]] [[universe]], or on the subuniverse of [[propositions]].

See for instance ([Benton-Bierman-de Paiva, section 3.2](#BentonBiermanPaiva)), ([Kobayashi](#Kobayashi)), ([Gabbay-Nanevski, section 8](#GabbayNanevski)), ([Gaubault-Larrecq, Goubault, section 5.1](#Gaubault-LarrecqGoubault)), ([Park-Harper, section 2.6](#ParkHarper)), ([Shulman](#Shulman)) as examples of the first, and ([Moggi, def. 4.7](#Moggi)), ([Awodey-Birkedal, section 4.2](#AwodeyBirkedal)) as examples of the second.

## Examples

### Geometric modality -- Grothendieck topology
 {#GeometricModality}

As a special case of the [modalities-are-monads](#RelationToMonads) relation,
a [[Grothendieck topology]] on the [[site]] underlying a [[presheaf topos]] is equivalently encoded in the [[sheafification]] [[monad]] $PSh(C) \to Sh(C) \hookrightarrow PSh(C)$ induced by the [[sheaf topos]] [[geometric embedding]].  More generally, any geometric subtopos is equivalently represented by a left-exact idempotent monad.

When restricted to act on [[truncated object|(-1)-truncated objects]] (i.e. [[subterminal objects]] or more generally [[monomorphisms]]), this becomes a [[universal closure operator]].  When internalized as an operation on the [[subobject classifier]], this becomes the corresponding [[Lawvere-Tierney operator]]. This modal perspective on sheafification was maybe first made explicit by [[Bill Lawvere]]:

> A Grothendieck 'topology' appears most naturally as a modal operator of the nature 'it is locally the case that' ([Lawvere](#Lawvere)).

Here, "It is locally the case that [X is [[metric space#metrizable_spaces|metrizable]]/Euclidean/etc]," corresponds to, "X is locally metrizable/Euclidean/etc," in the usual parlance.

More discussion is in ([Goldblatt](#Goldblatt)), where this kind of modality is called a _geometric modality_.

For [[higher toposes]], it is no longer true in general that a subtopos is determined by its behavior on the $(-1)$-truncated objects, but we can still regard the entire sheafification monad as a [[higher modality]] in the internal [[homotopy type theory]].

### Closure modality

The canonical monad on a [[local topos]] gives rise to a closure modality on propositions in its internal language, as described in ([Awodey-Birkedal](#AwodeyBirkedal)).

### Necessity and possibility

See at _[[necessity and possibility]]_ the section _[Possible worlds via dependent type theory](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/necessity+and+possibility#InFirstOrderLogicAndTypeTheory)_

### Cohesive and differential modality

By adding to [[homotopy type theory]] three (higher) modalities that encode [[discrete object|discrete types]] and [[codiscrete object|codiscrete types]] and hence implicitly a non-(co)-discrete notion of [[cohesion]] one obtained _[[cohesive homotopy type theory]]_. Adding furthermore modalities for _infinitesimal_ (co)discreteness yields [[differential homotopy type theory]].

The system CS4 in ([Kobayashi](#Kobayashi)) yields a constructive version of [[S4 modal logic]].
