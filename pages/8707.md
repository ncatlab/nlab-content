## Idea

_Modal type theory_ is a flavor of [[type theory]] with [[type formation rules]] for [[modalities]], as in [[modal logic]]. 
A survey of the field is in ([de Paiva-Goré-Mendler](#PaivaGoreMendler)).

When the underlying type theory is [[homotopy type theory]] these modalities are a "higher" generalization of traditional modalities, with "higher" in the sense of [[higher category theory]]: they have [[categorical semantics]] in [[(∞,1)-categories]]. See ([Shulman](#Shulman)) for remarks on such _higher modalities_.

## Properties

### Relation to monads
 {#RelationToMonads}

At least in many cases, modalities in type theory are identified with [[monads (in computer science)|monads]] or comonads on the underlying [[type]] [[universe]], or on the subuniverse of [[propositions]].

See for instance ([Benton-Bierman-de Paiva, section 3.2](#BentonBiermanPaiva)), ([Kobayashi](#Kobayashi)), ([Gabbay-Nanevski, section 8](#GabbayNanevski)), ([Gaubault-Larrecq, Goubault, section 5.1](#Gaubault-LarrecqGoubault)), ([Park-Harper, section 2.6](#ParkHarper)), ([Shulman](#Shulman)) as examples of the first, and ([Moggi, def. 4.7](#Moggi)), ([Awodey-Birkedal, section 4.2](#AwodeyBirkedal)) as examples of the second.

## Examples

### Geometric modality -- Grothendieck topology
 {#GeometricModality}

As a special case of the [modalities-are-monads](#RelationToMonads) relation,
a [[Grothendieck topology]] on the [[site]] underlying a [[presheaf topos]] is equivalently encoded in the [[sheafification]] [[monad]] $PSh(C) \to Sh(C) \hookrightarrow PSh(C)$ induced by the [[sheaf topos]] [[geometric embedding]].  More generally, any geometric subtopos is equivalently represented by a left-exact idempotent monad.

When restricted to act on [[truncated object|(-1)-truncated objects]] (i.e. [[subterminal objects]] or more generally [[monomorphisms]]), this becomes a [[universal closure operator]].  When internalized as an operation on the [[subobject classifier]], this becomes the corresponding [[Lawvere-Tierney operator]]. This modal perspective on sheafification was maybe first made explicit by [[Bill Lawvere]]:

> A Grothendieck 'topology' appears most naturally as a modal operator of the nature 'it is locally the case that' ([Lawvere](#Lawvere)).

More discussion along these lines is in ([Goldblatt](#Goldblatt)), where this kind of modality is called a _geometric modality_.

For [[higher toposes]], it is no longer true in general that a subtopos is determined by its behavior on the $(-1)$-truncated objects, but we can still regard the entire sheafification monad as a [[higher modality]] in the internal [[homotopy type theory]].

### Closure modality

The canonical monad on a [[local topos]] gives rise to a closure modality on propositions in its internal language, as described in ([Awodey-Birkedal](#AwodeyBirkedal)).

### Cohesive and differential modality

By adding to [[homotopy type theory]] three (higher) modalities that encode [[discrete object|discrete types]] and [[codiscrete object|codiscrete types]] and hence implicitly a non-(co)-discrete notion of [[cohesion]] one obtained _[[cohesive homotopy type theory]]_. Adding furthermore modalities for _infinitesimal_ (co)discreteness yields [[differential homotopy type theory]].

The modal systems "CL" and "PLL" in ([Benton-Bierman-Paiva](#BentonBiermanPaiva)) and ([Fairlough-Mendler](#FairloughMendler)), respectively,  turn out to be equivalent to the geometric modality of [Goldblatt](#Goldblatt). The system CS4 in ([Kobayashi](#Kobayashi)) yields a constructive version of [[S4 modal logic]].
