###### Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ a [[natural number]], write $\mathbb{R}^n$ for the [[Cartesian space]] of [[dimension]] $n$. The **Euclidean topology** is the [[topology]] on $\mathbb{R}^n$ characterized by the following equivalent statements

* it is the [[metric space|metric topology]] induced from the canonical structure of a [[metric space]] on $\mathbb{R}^n$ with [[distance]] function given by $d(x,y) = \sqrt{\sum_{i = 1}^n (x_i-y_i)^2}$;

* an [[open subset]] is precisely a subset such that contains an [[open ball]] around each of its points;

* it is the [[product topology]] induced from the standard topology on the [[real line]].

## Properties 

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

Two [[Cartesian space]]s $\mathbb{R}^k$ and $\mathbb{R}^l$ (with the Euclidean topology) are [[homeomorphic]] precisely if $k = l$.

A proof of this statement was an early success of [[algebraic topology]].
