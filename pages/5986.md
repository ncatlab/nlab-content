The most useful notion of [[homomorphism]] between [[Lie groupoid]]s is not that of a [[functor]] [[internalization|internal to]] the category [[SmoothMfd]] of [[smooth manifold]]s (even though [[Lie groupoids]] can be regarded as [[internal groupoids]] in [[SmoothMfd]]), but is that of a morphism of [[smooth stacks]] ([[differentiable stacks]]) on the [[site]] [[SmoothMfd]]. To amplify this distinction in the literature a wealth of names and terms for these non-na&iuml;ve homomorphisms is used, such as _Morita morphism_ . In particular a Morita morphism which is a [[homotopy equivalence]] is a _[[Morita equivalence]]_.

Ways to present the correct notion of homomorphism include

* [[anafunctors]] 

* [[groupoid principal bundle|groupoid principal]] [[bibundles]], [[Hilsum-Skandalis morphisms]]
