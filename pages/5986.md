The correct notion of [[homomorphism]] between [[Lie groupoid]]s is not that of a [[functor]] [[internalization|internal to]] the category [[SmoothMfd]] of [[smooth manifold]]s (even though [[Lie groupoid]]s can be regarded as [[internal groupoid]]s in [[SmoothMfd]]), but is that of a morphism of [[stack]]s on the [[site]] [[SmoothMfd]]. To amplify this distinction in the literature a wealth of names and terms for these non-na&iuml;ve homomorphisms is used, such as _Morita morphism_ . 

One way to present the correct notion of homomorphism is a [[anafunctor]]s internal to [[SmoothMfd]].
