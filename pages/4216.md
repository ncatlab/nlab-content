## Definitions

In [[logic]], logical conjunction is the [[meet]] in the [[poset]] of [[truth values]].

Assuming that (as in [[classical logic]]) the only truth values are true ($T$) and false ($F$), then the conjunction $p \wedge q$ of the truth values $p$ and $q$ may be defined by a truth table:

|$p$|$q$| |$p \wedge q$|
|---|---|-|------------|
|$T$|$T$| |$T$|
|$T$|$F$| |$F$|
|$F$|$T$| |$F$|
|$F$|$F$| |$F$|

That is, $p \wedge q$ is true if and only if $p$ and $q$ are both true.  Conjunction also exists in nearly every non-classical logic.

More generally, if $p$ and $q$ are any two [[relations]] on the same domain, then we define their conjunction pointwise, thinking of a relation as a [[function]] to truth values.  If instead we think of a relation as a [[subset]] of its domain, then conjunction becomes [[intersection]].


## Remarks

As truth values form a poset, which is a degenerate kind of [[category]], so truth values under conjunction form a [[meet-semilattice]], which is a degenerate kind of [[cartesian monoidal category]].  Self-referentially, a [[poset]] is (up to [[equivalence of categories|equivalence]]) simply a [[category enriched]] over the cartesian monoidal category of truth values.  With [[implication]] as [[internal hom]], truth values form a [[closed cartesian category]].

Like any meet, conjunction is an associative operation, so we can take the conjunction of any finite positive whole number of truth values; the conjunction is true if and only if all of the individual truth values are true.  Conjunction also has an [[identity element]], which is the [[truth|true]] truth value.  Some logics allow a notion of infinitary conjunction.  Indexed conjunction is [[universal quantification]].


## Rules

That conjunction is a [[meet]] means that $p \wedge q$ may be proved in a [[context]] $\Gamma$ if and only if both $p$ and $q$ may be proved in $\Gamma$.  This directly yields the introduction and elimination rules for conjunction in [[natural deduction]]:
$$ \begin {gathered}
   \frac { \Gamma \vdash p ; \; \Gamma \vdash q } { \Gamma \vdash p \wedge q } \; \text {introduction} \\
   \frac { \Gamma \vdash p \wedge q } { \Gamma \vdash p } \; \text {elimination 0} \\
   \frac { \Gamma \vdash p \wedge q } { \Gamma \vdash q } \; \text {elimination 1} \\
\end {gathered} $$

In [[sequent calculus]], the same ideas become these rules:
$$ \begin {gathered}
   \frac { \Gamma \vdash \Delta , p , \Sigma ; \; \Gamma \vdash \Delta , q , \Sigma } { \Gamma \vdash \Delta , p \wedge q , \Sigma } \; \text {right additive} \\
   \frac { \Gamma , p , \Delta \vdash \Sigma } { \Gamma , p \wedge q , \Delta \vdash \Sigma } \; \text {left additive 0} \\
   \frac { \Gamma , q , \Delta \vdash \Sigma } { \Gamma , p \wedge q , \Delta \vdash \Sigma } \; \text {left additive 1} \\
\end {gathered} $$

Equivalently, we can use the following rules with weakened contexts:
$$ \begin {gathered}
   \frac { \Gamma \vdash \Delta , p ; \; \Sigma \vdash q , \Pi } { \Gamma , \Sigma \vdash \Delta , p \wedge q , \Pi } \; \text {right multiplicative} \\
   \frac { \Gamma , p , q , \Delta \vdash \Sigma } { \Gamma , p \wedge q , \Delta \vdash \Sigma } \text {left multiplicative} \\
\end {gathered} $$

The rules above are written so as to remain valid in logics without the [[exchange rule]].  In [[linear logic]], the first batch of sequent rules apply to additive conjunction (interpret $p \wedge q$ in these rules as $p \& q$), while the second batch of rules apply to multiplicative conjunction (interpret $p \wedge q$ in those rules as $p \otimes q$).
