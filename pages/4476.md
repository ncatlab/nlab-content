## Definition

A **division algebra** is a possibly [[non-associative algebra]] $A$, typically over a field $k$, with the property that $a b = 0$ implies either $a = 0$ or $b = 0$ (or $a b \ne 0$ whenever $a, b \ne 0$).  If $A$ is finite-dimensional (over a [[field]]), this is equivalent to assuming that for any nonzero $a \in A$, the operations of left multiplication and right multiplication by $a$ are [[inverse|invertible]].  If furthermore $A$ is also [[associative unital algebra|associative and unital]], this is also equivalent to the existence, for each nonzero $a \in A$, of an element $a^{-1} \in A$ with $a a^{-1} = a^{-1} a = 1$.   However, it is easy to construct *nonassociative* unital finite-dimensional algebras over $\mathbb{R}$ (the field of [[real numbers]]) such that either:

* $A$ is not a division algebra but for each nonzero $a \in A$ there exists $a^{-1} \in A$ with $a a^{-1} = a^{-1} a = 1$.

* $A$ is a division algebra but there exists nonzero $a \in A$ for which there is no $a^{-1} \in A$ with $a a^{-1} = a^{-1} a = 1$.

## Related concepts

For applications to [[physics]], the most interesting division algebras are probably the [[normed division algebras]]: the [[real numbers]], [[complex numbers]], [[quaternion|quaternions]] and [[octonion|octonions]].  These have important relations to [[division algebras and supersymmetry|supersymmetry]].
