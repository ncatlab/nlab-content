## Definition

A __$*$-algebra__ is an [[associative algebra]] (or even a [[nonassociative algebra]]) $A$ equipped with an [[anti-involution]].

In more detail, begin with a [[commutative ring]] $K$ equipped with an [[involution]], written $x \mapsto \bar{x}$.  (The usual example for $K$ is the [[field]] $\mathbb{C}$ of [[complex numbers]], but the concept of $*$-algebra makes sense in more general contexts.  Note that we can take *any* commutative ring $K$ and simply define $\bar{x} \coloneqq x$.)  Then a __$K$-$*$-algebra__ (a $*$-algebra over $K$) is a $K$-[[module]] $A$ equipped with a $K$-[[bilinear map]] $A,A \to A$, written as multiplication (and often assumed to be associative) and a $K$-antilinear map $A \to A$, written as $x \mapsto x^*$, such that

* $x^{**} = x$ for all $x$ in $A$ (so we have an [[involution]]), and
* $(x y)^* = y^* x^*$ for all $x,y$ in $A$ (so it is an anti-involution).

The claim that the anti-involution is $K$-antilinear means that $(r x)^* = \overline{r} x^*$ for all $r$ in $K$ and all $x$ in $A$.

## Banach star-algebras

When $K$ is $\mathbb{C}$ (or the field $\mathbb{R}$ of [[real numbers]]), we can additionally ask that the $*$-algebra be a [[Banach algebra]]; then it is a __Banach $*$-algebra__.  Special cases of this are 

* $C^*$-[[C-star-algebra|algebras]] 

* and $W^*$-[[W-star-algebra|algebras]].
