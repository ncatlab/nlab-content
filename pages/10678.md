## Idea

A [[functor]] on [[spaces]] (e.g. some [[cohomology]] functor) is called "homotopy invariant" if  it does not distinguish between a space $X$ and the space $X \times I$, where $I$ is an [[interval]]; equivalently if it takes the same value on [[morphisms]] which are related by a ([[left homotopy|left]]) [[homotopy]].

The term _homotopy invariant_ may also refer to the refinement of [[invariants]] to [[homotopy theory]], hence to [[homotopy fixed points]].

## Examples

A [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]]-functor is by definition homotopy invariant, but for instance its refinement to [[differential cohomology]] in general no longer is.
