Frank Harary's classical _Graph Theory_ defines the concept of a _graph_ --- and much its conceptual neighborhood --- in the following manner:

: A (finite undirected) _graph_ $G$ consists of a finite nonempty set $V = V(G)$ of $p$ _points_ together with a prescribed set $X$ of $q$ unordered pairs of distinct points of $V$.  Each pair $x = \{u, v\}$ of points in $X$ is a _line_ of $G$, and $x$ is said to _join_ $u$ and $v$.  We write $x = u v$ and say that $u$ and $v$ are _adjacent points_ (sometimes denoted $u adj v$);  point $u$ and line $x$ are _incident_ with each other, as are $v$ and $x$.  If two distinct lines $x$ and $y$ are incident with a common point, then they are _adjacent lines_.  A graph with $p$ points and $q$ lines is called a $(p, q)$ _graph_.  The $(1, 0)$ graph is _trivial_.  (Harary, 1969, p. 9).

sorry to be a pain, inserting adjectives like that, but here at the Lab you'll likely be confronted with graphs with a proper class (or large set, depending on the flavour of your foundations) of vertices. Or at least any set of vertices whatever.
