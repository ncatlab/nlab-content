## Idea

In [[homotopy type theory]], the notion of **h-set** (or just a **set**, if no ambiguity will result) is an internalization of the notion of [[set]] / [[0-truncated]] object.

hSets can be regarded as a way of embedding [[extensional type theory]] into [[intensional type theory]].


## Definition

Let $A$ be a [[type]] in [[intensional type theory|intensional]] [[type theory]] with [[dependent sums]], [[dependent products]], and [[identity types]].  We define a new type $isSet(A)$ as follows:

$$isSet(A) \coloneqq \prod_{x\colon A} \prod_{y\colon A} isProp(x=y)$$

(using any equivalent definition of the [[predicate]] [[isProp]] for [[h-propositions]]; and where "$\prod$" denotes [[dependent product]] types and "$=$" denotes [[identity types]]).


In other words, the only relationship between two elements of an h-set is whether they are equal; there is no room for more than one path between them.  By [[beta reduction|beta-reducing]] this definition, we can express it as
$$isSet(A) \coloneqq \prod_{x,y\colon A} \prod_{p,q\colon x=y} (p=q)$$
In other words, any two parallel paths in $A$ are equal.

A provably [[equivalence in homotopy type theory|equivalent]] definition is
$$isSet(A) \coloneqq \prod_{x\colon A} \prod_{p\colon x=x} (p=id_x)$$
This says that a version of Streicher's "axiom K" holds for h-sets.


## Examples

* Most (non-[[higher inductive type|higher]]) [[inductive types]] are h-sets (assuming that all their parameters and indices are so).  In particular, the type of [[natural numbers]] is an h-set.  This can be proven from Theorem \ref{DecidableIsSet} below.


## Properties

One interesting consequence of this definition is the following.

###### Theorem
Suppose that $A$ is a [[type]] which has [[decidable equality]] in the [[propositions as types]] [[logic]] (which is not the logic of h-propositions usually used in HoTT).  In other words, the projection
$$\array{Paths_A + (0\to A\times A)^{(Paths_A\to A\times A)}\\
\downarrow\\
A\times A}
$$

(where $Paths_A$ is the [[path object|path type]] of $A$, "+" forms the [[sum type]], and on the right we have the $A \times A$-[[dependent type|dependent]] [[function type]] into the [[empty type]]), has a section.  

Then $A$ is a set.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
Let $d$ be the given [[section]].  Thus, for any $x,y\colon A$, $d(x,y)$ is either a path from $x$ to $y$ or a function from $Paths(x,y)$ to the empty type (implying that $Paths(x,y)$ is also empty).

It suffices to exhibit an operation connecting any endo-path $p \in Paths(x,x)$ to the identity path $1_x$.  Given such a path, define $q = d(x,x)$.  If $d(x,x)$ lies in the second case, then $Paths(x,x)$ is empty, a contradiction since we know it contains $1_x$; hence we may assume $q\in Paths(x,x)$ as well.

Let $r$ be the image of $(1_x,p) \in Paths_{A\times A}((x,x),(x,x)$ under the section $d$.  This is a path in the total space $Paths_A$ lying over the path $(1_x,p)$ in $A$.  Equivalently, it is a path in the fiber over $x$ from $(1_x,p)_*(d(x,x))$ to $d(x,x)$, where $(1_x,p)_*$ denotes transport in the fibration $Paths_A \to A\times A$ along the path $(1_x,p)$.  However, we have defined $d(x,x) = q$, and transport in a path-space is just composition, so $r$ may be regarded as a path from $q p$ to $q$.  Canceling $q$, we obtain a path from $p$ to $1_x$.
