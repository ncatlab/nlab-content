This entry is about the general properties and characterization of [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categories]] of [[(infinity,1)-sheaf|(infinity,1)-sheaves]] (also known as [[infinity-stack]]s).

The 1-categorical analog of the discussion is this entry is at [[category of sheaves]].

#Idea#

For any [[(infinity,1)-category]] $C$ every [[(infinity,1)-functor]] $\bar {(-)} : C \to D$ which admits a [[(infinity,1)-fully faithful functor|fully faithful]] [[adjoint (infinity,1)-functor|right adjoint]] -- equivalently every [[(infinity,1)-functor]] $L : C \to C$ which is 
[[adjoint (infinity,1)-functor|left adjoint]] to the inclusion $L C \hookrightarrow C$ of its [[essential image|essential image]] $L C$ into $C$ -- is a [[localization of an (infinity,1)-category]] onto a [[reflective (infinity,1)-subcategory]] characterized by the collection $W$ of [[morphism|morphisms]] which it sends to [[(infinity,1)-equivalence|equivalences]]. One can think of it 

* as _inverting_ these morphisms;

* as projecting onto those objects of $C$ which are [[local object|local]] with respect to these morphsims: those objects which sees $W$ as a collection of equivalences.

Using the familiar characterization of the [[category of sheaves]] in the 1-categorical context, this straightforwardly suggests to characterize 
_$(\infinity,1)$-categories $Sh(S)$ of $(\infty,1)$-sheaves_ -- also called (Grothendieck-Rezk-Lurie) [[(infinity,1)-topos|(infinity,1)-topoi]] as essential images of [[exact (infinity,1)-functor|left exact]] $(\infty,1)$-functors 

$$
 \bar{(-)} : PSh(S) \to Sh(S)
$$ 

(called [[infinity-stackification]], analogous to [[sheafification]])

that have a 
[[(infinity,1)-fully faithful functor|fully faithful]] [[adjoint (infinity,1)-functor|right adjoint]] [[stuff, structure, property|forgetful]] functor

$$
  Sh(S) \hookrightarrow PSh(S)
  \,.
$$


#Examples#

* The best developed example is the Brown-Joyal-Jardine construction of $(\infty,1)$-categories of sheaves in terms of [[model structure on simplicial presheaves|model categories]] of [[simplicial presheaf|simplicial presheaves]], which turns out to be a _hypercompletion_ of an $(\infty,1)$-category of $(\infty,1)$-sheaves.

#References#

The study of simplicial presheaves apparently goes back to 

* K. Brown, [Abstract Homotopy Theory and Generalized Sheaf Cohomology](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/BrownAHT)

which considers locally [[Kan complex|Kan]] [[simplicial presheaf|simplicial presheaves]] as a [[category of fibrant objects]].

This was later conceived in terms of a [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] and on simplicial sheaves by Jocal and Jardine. To&euml; summarizes the situation and emphasizes the interpretation in terms of [[infinity-stack]]s living in $(\infty,1)$-categories for instance in

B. To&euml;n, _Higher and derived stacks: a global overview_   ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0604504)) .

The full picture in terms of Grothendieck-$(\infty,1)$-topoi of $(\infty,1)$-sheaves is the topic of

J. Lurie, [[Higher Topos Theory]].

* localization $(\infty,1)$-functors ($(\infty,1)$-sheafification for the present purpose) are discussed in section 5.2.7;

* local objects ($(\infty,1)$-sheaves for the present purpose) and [[local isomorphism]]s are discussed in section 5.5.4;

* the definition of $(\infty,1)$-topoi of $(\infty,1)$-sheaves is then definition 6.1.0.4 in section 6.1;

* the characterization of $(\infty,1)$-sheaves in terms of [[descent|descent and codescent]] is in section 6.1.3 

* the relation between the Brown--Joyal--Jardine model and the general story is discussed at length in section 6.5.4
