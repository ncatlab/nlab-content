## Definitions

Classically:
+-- {: .num_defn #classical}
###### Definition

A **field** is a [[commutative ring]] in which every nonzero element has a multiplicative [[inverse]] and $0 \neq 1$ (which may be combined as: an element is invertible if and only if it is nonzero).
=--

Fields are studied in *field theory* which is a branch of [[commutative algebra]]. 

Not assuming the commutativity axiom, then the result is a [[skewfield]] (also in some contexts simply called a "field"). For example, the [[free field (algebra)|free field]] of Cohn and Amitsur is in fact noncommutative.  


### Constructive notions
{#constructive}

Fields are (arguably) not a purely [[algebra|algebraic]] notion in that they don\'t form an [[algebraic category]] (see [discussion below](#category)).  For this reason, it should be unsurprising that in [[constructive mathematics]] (including the [[internal logic]] of a [[topos]]) there are different inequivalent ways to define a field.  In this case the classical definition is not usually the best one; for instance, the real numbers do not satisfy it.  There are several potential replacements with their own advantages and disadvantages.

+-- {: .num_defn #discrete}
###### Definition

If we replace "an element is invertible iff it is nonzero" in Definition \ref{classical} by "an element is invertible [[xor]] it equals zero" (which is equivalent in [[classical logic]] but stronger in [[constructive logic]]), then we obtain the notion of **discrete field**.
=--

Such a field $F$ is 'discrete' in that it decomposes as a coproduct $F = \{0\} \sqcup F^\times$ (where $F^\times$ is the subset of invertible elements).  An advantage is that this is a [[coherent logic|coherent theory]]; a disadvantage is that it is not satisfied (constructively) by the ring of [[real numbers]] (however these are defined), although it is satisfied by the ring of [[rational number|rational]] (or even [[algebraic number|algebraic]]) numbers and by the [[finite field]]s as usual.

+-- {: .num_defn #heyting}
###### Definition

If we interpret 'nonzero' in Definition \ref{classical} as a reference to a [[tight apartness relation]], thus defining the apartness relation $\#$ by $x # y$ iff $x - y$ is invertible, then we obtain the notion of **Heyting field**. (As shown [here](/nlab/show/local+ring#internal), the ring operations become strongly extensional functions.) 
=--

This is how 'practising' constructive analysts of the Bishop school usually define the simple word 'field'.  An advantage is that the (located Dedekind) [[real numbers]] form a Heyting field, although (for example) the (less located) [[MacNeille real number]]s need not form a Heyting field; another disadvantage is that this is not a coherent axiom and so cannot be [[internalization|internalized]] in as many categories.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

If we replace "an element is invertible iff it is nonzero" in Definition \ref{classical} by "an element is noninvertible iff it is zero" (which is equivalent in [[classical logic]] but incomparable in [[constructive logic]]), we obtain the notion of **residue field** (which is not quite the same as the [[residue fields]] of [[algebraic geometry]]).
=--

An advantage is that even more versions of the [[real numbers]] (including the [[MacNeille real number]]s) form a residue field; disadvantages are that this axiom is not coherent either and that a residue field lacks an [[apartness relation]] (in particular, the MacNeille reals have no apartness).

Every discrete field is also a Heyting field, and every Heyting field is also a residue field. A Heyting or residue field is a discrete field if and only if [[decidable equality|equality is decidable]]; it is in this sense that a discrete field is 'discrete'.

A residue field is a Heyting field if and only if it is a [[local ring]]. Furthermore, the quotient ring (or 'residue ring') of any local ring by its ideal of noninvertible elements is a Heyting field; in particular, it is a [[residue field]] (hence that name).  On the other hand, not every residue field is even a local ring (the MacNeille reals are not), so not every residue field is the residue ring of any local ring.

Counterexamples were remarked above, but to be explicit: The (located Dedekind) [[real numbers]] form a Heyting field which need not be discrete. The [[MacNeille real number]]s form a residue field which need not be Heyting; see section D4.7 of _[[Elephant|Sketches of an Elephant]]_.


## Properties

### Category of fields
{#category}

Fields are not as well-behaved [[category theory|categorically]] as most other common algebraic structures ([[groups]], [[rings]], [[modules]], etc.).  In particular, the [[category]] of fields and field homomorphisms (a [[full subcategory]] of the category of [[rings]]) is not [[complete category|complete]] or [[cocomplete category|cocomplete]], although it is [[accessible category|accessible]].

In particular, it lacks a terminal object and also lacks an initial object (though it has a [[weakly initial set]], namely the set of [[prime field]]s).  In particular, it is therefore not [[algebraic category|algebraic]] or [[locally presentable category|locally presentable]].


### Accessibility and sketchability
{#AccSketch}

The [[category]] of fields is [[accessible category|accessible]], even *finitely* accessible, and therefore can be presented as the category of models (in [[Set]]) of a mixed limit-colimit [[sketch]].  It is moreover straightforward to write down such a sketch.

We suppose as given to start with a [[limit sketch]] whose models are [[commutative rings]], with $F$ denoting the ring.  We can construct via limit constructions a subobject $I\hookrightarrow F$ consisting of the invertible elements, as the equalizer of the two maps
$$ F \times F \;\rightrightarrows\; F,$$
the first being given by multiplication and the second by the composite $F\times F \to * \overset{1}{\to} F$, where $*$ is terminal and the map labeled "1" picks out the element $1\in F$.  We now assert that if we take the pullback
$$\array{P & \overset{}{\to} & * \\
  \downarrow && \downarrow^0\\
  I& \hookrightarrow & F,}$$
where the map labeled "0" picks out the element $0\in F$, then the object $P$ is initial (i.e. $0$ is not invertible, or equivalently not equal to $1$), and moreover the pullback is also a pushout (i.e. every element of $F$ is either $0$ or invertible).  Of course, in making these last two assertions we use the fact that we are allowing ourselves a limit-colimit sketch instead of just a limit sketch.

Note that this gives us the notion of *discrete* field (see the [constructive definitions](#constructive) above).  The other constructive notions of field can also be described as models for different limit-colimit sketches.


## Examples
 {#Examples}

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

There are the fields of:

* [[rational numbers]],

* [[algebraic numbers]],

* [[real numbers]],

* [[complex numbers]],

* [[p-adic numbers]] (for $p$ a [[prime number]]).

* Also the various [[finite fields]].

###### Example

The canonical  [[ring object|local ring object]] of the [[Zariski site|gros Zariski topos]] of any [[scheme]] (given by $S \mapsto \Gamma(S, \mathcal{O}_S)$, that is to say, the affine line $\mathbb{A}^{1}_{S}$) is in fact moreover a field object, where the latter is defined by requiring that Definition \ref{classical} holds in the internal logic of this topos. For a proof, see Proposition 2.2 in the article [Universal projective geometry via topos theory](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022404976900025) of Anders Kock. The ring $\mathcal{O}_X$ (the [[structure sheaf]]) in the [[category of sheaves|sheaf topos]] (i.e. the petit Zariski topos) is a [[residue field]] if $X$ is a [[reduced scheme|reduced]] scheme.
