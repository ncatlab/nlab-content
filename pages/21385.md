## Idea

'Object-oriented programming' (OOP) is an approach to software development based on structuring code around _objects_. There are many possible frameworks for OOP, including the class-based approach of [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language), the prototype-based approach of [Self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_(programming_language)), and the 'everything is an object' approach of [Smalltalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk). Alan Kay, one of the creators of Smalltalk, famously said "I made up the term 'object-oriented', and I can tell you I did not have C++ in mind."

## Relation to category theory

Henry Story has [noted](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-functional-programming-seen-as-the-opposite-of-OOP-rather-than-an-addition-to-it/answer/Henry-Story) that, since OOP is coalgebraic and [[functional programming]] (FP) is algebraic, OOP and FP can in some sense be regarded as dual to each other. 

Although, in the context of [[computer science]], [[category theory]] is perhaps most often associated with [[functional programming]], there has been work on analysing object-oriented programming from a category-theoretic viewpoint, e.g. in the work of [[Bart Jacobs]] (e.g [Jacobs 2003](#Jacobs2003)).
