## Overview

In his influential 1821 textbook _[[Cours d'Analyse]]_, [[Augustin Cauchy]] states a theorem that is now widely regarded as false, attributed to a confusion between [[pointwise convergence]] and [[uniform convergence]].  This mistake ---if indeed it is a mistake--- is of both pedagogical and philosophical-historical interest.


## Statements

###### Non-theorem (Cauchy, 1821?)

Let $f = (f_1, f_2, \ldots)$ be an [[infinite sequence]] of [[continuous functions]] from the [[real line]] to itself.  Suppose that, for every [[real number]] $x$, the sequence $(f_1(x), f_2(x), \ldots)$ converges to some (necessarily unique) real number $f_\infty(x)$, defining a [[function]] $f_\infty$; in other words, the sequence $f$ [[pointwise convergence|converges pointwise]] to $f_\infty$.  Then $f_\infty$ is also continuous.

###### Theorem (Seidel, 1847)

Let $f = (f_1, f_2, \ldots)$ be an [[infinite sequence]] of [[continuous functions]] from the [[real line]] to itself.  Suppose that the sequence $f$ [[uniform convergence|converges uniformly]] to a function $f_\infty$.  Then $f_\infty$ is also continuous.

###### Theorem (???)

Let $f = (f_1, f_2, \ldots)$ be an [[equicontinuous family|equicontinuous]] [[infinite sequence|sequence]] of (necessarily [[continuous functions|continuous]]) functions from the [[real line]] to itself.  Suppose that, for every [[real number]] $x$, the sequence $(f_1(x), f_2(x), \ldots)$ converges to some (necessarily unique) real number $f_\infty(x)$, defining a [[function]] $f_\infty$; in other words, the sequence $f$ [[pointwise convergence|converges pointwise]] to $f_\infty$.  Then $f_\infty$ is also continuous.

## Proofs

Here is Cauchy\'s argument for Theorem \ref{mistake}:

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof?

At any $x$, we have
$$ {|f_\infty(x + \epsilon) - f_\infty(x)|}
 = {|f_\infty(x + \epsilon) - f_n(x + \epsilon) + f_n(x + \epsilon) - f_n(x) + f_n(x) - f_\infty(x)|}
 \leq {|f_\infty(x + \epsilon) - f_n(x + \epsilon)|} + {|f_n(x + \epsilon) - f_n(x)|} + {|f_n(x) - f_\infty(x)|} .$$
As $n$ becomes infinite and $\epsilon$ becomes infinitesimal, all of the terms on the right become infinitesimal (respectively, since $f$ converges to $f_\infty$ at $x + \epsilon$, since $f_n$ is continuous at $x$, and since $f$ converges to $f_\infty$ at $x$).  Thus, the expression on the left also becomes infinitesimal, proving that $f_\infty$ is continuous at $x$.
