## Idea

The [[sphere]] of [[dimension]] 4.

## Properties

### As part of the quaternionic Hopf fibration

The 4-sphere participates in the [[quaternionic Hopf fibration]], the analog of the complex [[Hopf fibration]] with the field of [[complex numbers]] replaced by the division ring of [[quaternions]] or Hamiltonian numbers $\mathbb{H}$.

  \array{
    S^3 &\hookrightarrow& S^7
    \\
    && \downarrow^\mathrlap{p}
    \\
    && S^4 &\stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}& \mathbf{B} SU(2)
  }
$$

Here the idea is that $S^7$ can be construed as $\{(x, y) \in \mathbb{H}^2: {|x|}^2 + {|y|}^2 = 1\}$, with $p$ mapping $(x, y)$ to $x/y$ as an element in the [[projective line]] $\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{H}) \cong S^4$, with each [[fiber]] a [[torsor]] parametrized by quaternionic [[scalars]] $\lambda$ of unit [[norm]] (so $\lambda \in S^3$).  This canonical $S^3$-bundle (or $SU(2)$-bundle) is classified by a map $S^4 \to \mathbf{B} SU(2)$.
