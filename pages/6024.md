## Idea ##
**Classical electrodynamics** is about the field theory of the electric and magnetic fields and its interactions with point charges from the viewpoint of [[classical physics]]. 


## References ##

Relativistic electrodynamics in the vacuum is a theory that can be very elegantly formulated with tools from differential geometry, see e.g.
