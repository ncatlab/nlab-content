## Definition

In [[algebra]], a unital [[ring]] is an __Ore domain__ if it is an [[integral domain]] (unital ring without [[zero divisors]]) $R$ in which the set $R^\times$ of all nonzero elements is an [[Ore set]]. Thus one can form the [[Ore localization]] $R[(R^\times)^{-1}]$ which is then a [[skew-field]] ([[division ring]]), called the _Ore quotient ring_ (Ore quotient (skew)field). As [[Ore localizations]] of domains always do, it comes with a map $R\to R[(R^\times)^{-1}]$ which is 1-1. For most purposes, one sided Ore condition is sufficient, hence one considers also the weaker notions of left and right Ore domains.
