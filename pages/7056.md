## Definition

A [[point]] of a [[topological space]] is called **focal** ([Freyd-Scedrov](#FreydScedrov)) if its only [[open neighbourhood]] is the entire space.

## Examples 

* The closed point $\bot$ of [[Sierpinski space]] $\mathbf{2}$ is a focal point. 

* The vertex $v$ of a Sierpinski cone (or [[scone]]) $s(X)$ on a space $X$, given by a pushout in $Top$ 
$$\array{
1 \times X & \to & 1 \\
\mathllap{\bot \times 1_X} \downarrow & & \downarrow \mathrlap{v} \\
\mathbf{2} \times X & \to & s(X),
}$$
is a focal point. This construction is in fact the same as generically adding a focal point to $X$. 

## Properties

The [[category of sheaves]] over (the [[site of open subsets]]) of a topological space with focal point is a [[local topos]].

Every [[topos]] has a [[free construction|free]] "completion" to a "focal space", given by its [[Freyd cover]].
