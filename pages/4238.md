## Idea

The term _topological conformal field theory_ (TCFT) is used for a  linearization or [[stabilization]] of something that is like a [[conformal field theory]] (CFT) up to [[homotopy]]. It is a notion somewhere half-way between a (2-dimensional) [[TQFT]] and a [[CFT]]. 

> (Actually, the remnant of conformal structure here should be just

> As the classification result by Lurie discussed below shows, 
> TCFTs are really $(\infty,2)$-TFTs.)

This formalizes the physics notion of "the [[topological string]]", a _topologically twisted_ superconformal field theory, such as, notably, the [[A-model]] and the [[B-model]]. TCFTs are therefore a tool for formalizing [[homological mirror symmetry]]. 

Recall that an ordinary [[conformal field theory]] (CFT) is, in [[FQFT]]-language, a [[symmetric monoidal functor]] on a [[category]] $Bord_2^{conf}$ whose objects are disjoint unions of intervals and circles, and whose [[morphism]]s are [[Riemann surface]]s with these 1d manifolds as incoming and outgoing punctures.

Since Riemann surfaces form a well-understood [[moduli space]], one can turn this also into a [[Top]]-[[enriched category]], i.e. an [[(∞,1)-category]], 
$Bord_{2}^{conf,top}$ whose [[hom-space]]s are these [[moduli space]]s of [[Riemann surface]]s with given 1d manifolds as incoming and outgoing punctures.

A "truly topological conformal field theory" would be an [[(∞,1)-functor]] of the form

$$
  Bord_2^{conf,top} \to \infty Grpd
$$

or similar. But what is actually called a "topological conformal field theory" is the linearization or [[stabilization]] of this:

in a TCFT, this [[(∞,1)-category]] of conformal [[cobordism]]s is replaced by a [[stable (∞,1)-category]] whose [[hom-object]]s (when modeled by a [[dg-category]]) are just the [[homology]] [[chain complex]]s of the original [[hom-space]]s.


Write $Bord_2^{conf,dg}$ for the resulting [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal]] [[dg-category]] of Riemann cobordisms. Then a TCFT is a an homotopy-symmetric monoidal [[chain complex]]-[[enriched functor]]

$$
  F : Bord_2^{conf,dg} \to Ch_\bullet
$$

to the symmetric monoidal [[dg-category]] of chain complexes.

This means in particular that when two [[Riemann surface]]s $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$ are homologous as chains in the [[moduli space]] of Riemann surfaces, then the TCFT will send them to two equivalent morphisms $f_{\Sigma_1}$ and $f_{\Sigma_2}$ of chain complexes between the in- and the output states. The equivalence between $f_{\Sigma_1}$ and $f_{\Sigma_2}$, however, is not unique neither up to equivalence. Rather, it funtorially depends on the 1-chain realizing the homology equivalence between $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$ as 0-chains in the moduli space. In particular, two non-homologous 1-chains between $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$ will in general lead 
to non-equivalent equivalences between $f_{\Sigma_1}$ and $f_{\Sigma_2}$.

## Definition

According to [[On the Classification of Topological Field Theories|ClassTFT]]
the original definition of the domain for TCFTs can be formulated as follows (without reference to any conformal or Riemann structure). 

**Definition**
The $(\infty,2)$-category $Bord^{nc}_2$ of non-compact 2-dimensional cobordism is defined as follows:

* The objects of $Bord^{nc}_2$ are oriented 0-manifolds.

* Given a pair of objects $X, Y \in Bord^{nc}_2$ , a 1-morphism from $X$ to $Y$ is an oriented bordism $B : X \to Y$.

* Given a pair of 1-morphsims $B,B' : X \to Y$ in $Bord^{nc}_2$, a 2-morphism from $B$ to $B'$ in $Bord^{nc}_2$ is
an oriented bordism $\Sigma: B \to B'$ (which is trivial along $X$ and $Y$) with the following property: every
connected component of $\Sigma$ has nonempty intersection with $B'$.

* Higher morphisms in $Bord^{nc}_2$ are given by (orientation preserving) diffeomorphisms, isotopies between
diffeomorphisms, and so forth.

Then, the [[cobordism hypothesis]]-theorem for $Bord^{nc}_2$ becomes

**Theorem** 
Let $C$ be a [[symmetric monoidal (∞,2)-category]]. Then 
symmetric monoidal [[(∞,2)-functor]]s

$$
  Z : Bord^{nc}_2 \to C
$$

are equivalent to [[Calabi-Yau object]]s $A$ in $C$:
the functor $Z$ sends the point to $A$.

This is [[On the Classification of Topological Field Theories|ClassTFT, theorem 4.2.11]]. One can "unfold" $Bord^{nc}_2$ and the theorem above, obtaining a statement in terms of [[symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category|symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-categories]]. Actually it was the unfolded version to be proven first, by [[Kevin Costello]] in [Cos04](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0412149), in the particular case $C=Ch_\bullet$. We state it below in the general version given by [[Jacob Lurie]] in [[On the Classification of Topological Field Theories|ClassTFT]].

**Definition**

Let $\mathcal{OC}$ be the [[(infinity,1)-category]] of open-closed strings, described as follows:

1. objects are oriented 1-manifolds with boundary;

1. morphisms are oriented bordisms between 1-manifolds such that each
   connected component has non-vanishing intersection with the codomain
   1-manifold;

1. the higher morphisms are given by orientation preserving
   [[diffeomorphism]]s, isotopies between these, and so forth.

Write $\mathcal{O}$ for the full [[sub-(∞,1)-category]] on 
disjoint unions of intervals (open strings sector).

This is [[On the Classification of Topological Field Theories|ClassTFT, above theorem 4.2.13]].


## Classification

### With coefficients in chain complexes

The original statement of the classification result for TCFTs 
concerned symmetric homotopy-monoidal functors $Bord_2^{conf,dg} \to Ch_\bullet$:

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition
([[Kevin Costello|Costello]], following [[Maxim Kontsevich|Kontsevich]])

1. The category of open TCFTs with set $\Lambda$ of D-branes is equivalent to that of [[Calabi-Yau categories]] with set $\Lambda$ of objects.

1. The homology of the chain complex of closed states of the universal extension of an open TCFT to an open-closed TCFT is the [[Hochschild homology]] of the corresponding [[Calabi-Yau category]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

In [Cos04](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0412149) this is proven using information about cell decompositions of the moduli space of punctured Riemann surfaces, thus effectively presenting $Bord_2^{conf,dg}$ by generators-and-relations, The then theorem amounts to noticing that representations of these generators and relations define the operations in an $A_\infty$-category with pairing operation.

### General version


**Theorem**

Let $C$ be a [[symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category]]. Then 
symmetric monoidal [[(∞,1)-functor]]s

$$
  Z : \mathcal{O} \to C
$$

are equivalent to [[Calabi-Yau algebra object]]s $A$ in $C$:
the functor $Z$ sends the interval $[0,1]$ to $A$.

This is the result of [Cos04](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0412149)
reformulated and generalized according to 
[[On the Classification of Topological Field Theories|ClassTFT, theorem 4.2.14]].

This is a special case of the general [[cobordism hypothesis]]-theorem.


The idea of the proof is that a topological open string theory, i.e., a symmetric monoidal [[(∞,1)-functor]] $Z : \mathcal{O} \to C$ has a [[Kan extension]] to an open-closed topological string theory, i.e., to a symmetric monoidal [[(∞,1)-functor]] $Z : \mathcal{OC} \to C$, which is the unfolded version of a symmetric monoidal [[(∞,2)-functor]] from $Bord^{nc}_2$ to a symmetric monoidal $(\infty,2)$-category $C'$.

## Worldsheet and effective background theories {#ActionFunctionals}

One imagines generally that one obtains TCFTs, in their formal definition given above, from worldsheet [[action functional]]s as familiar from the physics literature (such as on the [[A-model]] and the [[B-model]]) by performing the [[path integral]] and finding from it a collection of [[differential form]]s on [[moduli space]] of bosonic field configurations.

It seems there is at this point no literature giving a direct construction along these lines, but there is the following:

In [Cos06](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0605647) is constructed from the geometric input datum of a generalized [[Calabi-Yau space]] $(X,Q)$ and it is shown that

1. there is a collection of differential forms $K_{g,h}(\cdots)$on the [[moduli space]] $\mathcal{M}_{g}^{h,n}$ of [[Riemann surface]]s such that these define a 2d TCFT;

   (In the discussion leading up to Lemma 4.5.1 there. The proof that this yields a TCFT is theorem 4.5.4.)

1. the partition function of the string perturbation series for the 
   above TCFT is

   $$
     \sum_{{g,n \geq 0, h \gt 0} \atop {2g-2+h+\frac{n}{2}}}
     \lambda^{2g-2+h}N^h
     \frac{1}{n!}
     \int_{\mathcal{M}_g^{h,n}}
     K_{g,h}(a^\otimes n)
   $$
   
   which is shown to be the partition function of a background 
   [[Chern-Simons theory]] coming from the [[action functional]]

   $$
     a \mapsto S(a) = \int_X \frac{1}{2} a Q a + \frac{1}{3}a^3
     \,.
   $$

So this construxts a 2d TCFT and shows that its [[effective field theory|effective]] background quantum field theory is a [[Chern-Simons theory]]. While the action functionl on the worldsheet itself, whose [[path integral]] should give the [[differential forms]] on [[moduli space]] considered above, is not explicitly considered here, this does formalizes at least some aspects of an observation that was earlier made in [Wit1995](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9207094) where it was observed that Chern-Simons theory is the effective background string theory of 2d TFTs obtained from action functionals of the A-model and the B-model.

Similarly the effective background QFT of the [[B-model]] topological string can be identified. This is known as _[[Kodeira-Spencer gravity]]_ or as _[[BCOV theory]]_.

So via the detour over the effective background field theory, this sort of shows that the physicist's A-model and B-model are indeed captured by the abstract [[FQFT]] definition of TCFT as given above.
