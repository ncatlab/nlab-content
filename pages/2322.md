
A crucial ingredient in a [[topos]] is a [[subobject classifier]]. That this has to do with [[subobject]] turns out to the a coincidence of low dimensions. As discussed at [[stuff, structure, property]], the classifying object in [[higher topos theory]] classify more general morphisms.

When one passes all the way to $\infty$-toposes, there should be objects that classify _all_ morphisms. This is made precise in the context of [[(∞,1)-topos]] [[Higher Topos Theory|theory]].

One way to characterize an [[(∞,1)-topos]] is as 

* a [[presentable (∞,1)-category]]

* with [[universal colimits]]

* such that for all sufficiently large [[regular cardinal]]s $\kappa$ there is a **classifying object** for the class of all $\kappa$-compact morphisms in $X$.

This statement is originally due to [[Charles Rezk]]. It is reproduced as theorem 6.1.6.8 in

* [[Jacob Lurie]], [[Higher Topos Theory]].
