## Idea

The _Deligne completeness theorem_, or **Deligne's theorem**, as it is also called, was initially proved by [[Pierre Deligne]] in an appendix of [[SGA4]][^sga] in the context of [[algebraic geometry]] as a theorem concerning the abundance of  _points_ for a [[coherent topos]].

When in the early 70s the connection between topos theory and logic became manifest [[William Lawvere]] (1975) pointed out that the theorem may be viewed as a variant of the classical [[GÃ¶del-Henkin completeness theorem]] for [[first-order logic]]: since points of a topos $\mathcal{E}$ correspond to set-theoretic models of the theory [[classifying topos|classified]] by $\mathcal{E}$ it amounts not only to saying that a finitary [[geometric theory]] $\mathbb{T}$ has models in $Set$ but that the provability of a sequent in [[coherent logic]] relative to $\mathbb{T}$ is equivalent to its validity in all set-theoretical models of $\mathbb{T}$.

## Statement

Recall that a point of a topos $\mathcal{E}$ is simply a geometric morphism $p:Set\to\mathcal{E}$ and that $\mathcal{E}$ is said to have [[enough points]] when for any two distinct parallel $f,g:A\to B$ in $\mathcal{E}$ there is a point $p$ that separates $f$ and $g$: $p*(f)\neq p*(g)$.

###### Theorem

A [[coherent topos]] has [[enough points]].

=--

As a corollary of the [[Deligne-Lurie completeness theorem]] this appears as ([[Spectral Schemes|Lurie SpecSchm, corollary 4.2]]).

## Remarks

Since a Grothendieck topos $\mathcal{E}$ has enough points iff it has a sufficient set of points in the sense that there is a [[surjective geometric morphism|surjection]] $Set/K\to \mathcal{E}$ with $K$ a set (cf. Johnstone [1977](#JT77), pp.224-229) and, furthermore, $Set/K\cong Sh(2^K)$,  one sees that Deligne's theorem yields a special form  $Sh(2^K)\to\mathcal{E}$ of [[Barr's theorem]].

A _general_ Grothendieck topos may fail to have enough points or even fail to have points at all, but it nevertheless has 'enough Boolean-valued points' (cf. [[Barr's theorem]]).
