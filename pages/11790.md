## Idea

The _Deligne completeness theorem_, or **Deligne's theorem**, as it is also called, was initially proved by [[Pierre Deligne]] in an appendix of [[SGA4]][^sga] in the context of [[algebraic geometry]] as a theorem concerning the abundance of  _points_ for a [[coherent topos]].

When in the early 70s the connection between topos theory and logic became manifest [[William Lawvere]] (1975) pointed out that the theorem may be viewed as a variant of the classical **Gödel-Henkin completeness theorem** for [[first-order logic]]: As points of a topos $\mathcal{E}$ correspond to set-theoretic models of the theory [[classifying topos|classified]] by $\mathcal{E}$ it amounts to saying that a (consistent) finitary [[geometric theory]] has models in $Set$.

## Statement

Recall that a point of a topos $\mathcal{E}$ is simply a geometric morphism $p:Set\to\mathcal{E}$ and that $\mathcal{E}$ is said to have [[enough points]] when for any two distinct parallel $f,g:A\to B$ in $\mathcal{E}$ there is a point $p$ that separates $f$ and $g$: $p*(f)\neq p*(g)$.

###### Theorem

A [[coherent topos]] has [[enough points]].

As a corollary of the [[Deligne-Lurie completeness theorem]] this appears as ([[Spectral Schemes|Lurie SpecSchm, corollary 4.2]]).
