## Idea

In the construction of [[perturbative quantum field theory]] via the method of [[causal perturbation theory]] the [[interaction]] terms used in the mathematical construction of the [[S-matrix]] are multiplied with a "[[coupling constant]]" $g$ which is in fact taken to be a [[smooth function]] of [[compact support]] on [[spacetime]], hence a [[bump function]]. This means that the [[interactions]] is non-trivial only on a [[compact topological space|compact]] [[subspace]] of [[spacetime]], towards its boundary it smoothly drops to zero. Hence outside this region the interaction is "switched off" and since this switching off happens not abrubtly by smoothly, it is called, borrowing a term from [[thermodynamics]] "adiabatic switching off of the interaction".

Since the actual interactions in [[physics]] are of course _not_ "switched off" anywhere, the use of an adiabatic switching is just an intermediate mathematical step.

Originally in ([Epstein-Glaser 73](#EpsteinGlaser73)) the idea was that after having constructed the [[S-matrix]] for any adiabatic switching $g$, the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] ("adiabatic limit") $g \to 1$ had to be taken to remove the switching in the end. Failure of this limit to exist is interpreted as "infrared divergency" of the [[perturbative quantum field theory]] (since the divergency comes from large scales, hence long [[wavelength]]).

But as observed in ([Il'in-Slavnov 78](#IlinSlavnov78)) and rediscovered in ([Brunetti-Fredenhagen 00](#BrunettiFredenhagen00)), an adiabatic switching map that is unity on a globally hyperbolic sub-spacetime $O \subset X$ is sufficient to compute the perturbative [[algebra of quantum observables]] $A(O)$ on that subspace, and the collection of all of these as $O$ ranges forms a [[local net of observables]] which fully captures the [[quantum field theory]] in the sense of the [[Haag-Kastler axioms]]. This perspective is now known as _[[locally covariant algebraic quantum field theory]]_.
