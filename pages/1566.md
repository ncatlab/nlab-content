An _abelian monoid_ is a [[monoid]] where the multiplication satisfies the commutative law:
$$x y = y x.$$

Alternatively, just as a [[monoid]] is a [[category]] with one object, an abelian monoid is a [[monoidal category]] with one object and one morphism.

An [[abelian group]] is an abelian monoid that is also a [[group]].
