## Definition

A _commutative monoid_ is a [[monoid]] where the multiplication satisfies the commutative law:
$$x y = y x.$$

Alternatively, just as a [[monoid]] can be seen as a [[category]] with one object, a commutative monoid can be seen as a [[monoidal category]] with one object and one morphism.

## Examples

* An [[abelian group]] is a commutative monoid that is also a [[group]].

* The natural numbers (together with 0) form a commutative monoid under addition.

* Every bounded [[semilattice]] is an _idempotent_ commutative monoid, and every idempotent commutative monoid yields a semilattice, (see that entry).
