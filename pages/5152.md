##Idea

Spherical objects in a general [[pointed category|pointed]]  [[model category]] play the role of the spheres in $Top$.


Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[pointed category|pointed]] [[model category]].

######Definition######
A **spherical object** for $\mathcal{C}$ is a [[model category|cofibrant]] homotopy [[cogroup]] in $\mathcal{C}$.

##Examples

1. The spheres form the obvious examples of spherical objects in the category $Top$, but the rational spheres give other examples.

1. In the category of path connected pointed spaces with action of a discrete group, $Gr.Top^*_0$ and space of form $S^n_G= \bigvee_G S^n$ is a spherical object.(see Baues, 1991, ref. below, p.273).

1. Any rational sphere is a sphere object (in a suitable category for [[rational homotopy theory]]).

1. Let $T$ be a contractible locally finite 1-dimensional simplicial complex, with $T^0$ its 0-skeleton. Let $\epsilon : E'T^0$ be a finite-to-one function. By $S^n_\epsilon$ we mean the space obtained by attaching an $n$-sphere to the vertices of $T$ with at vertex $v$, the spheres attached to $v$ being indexed by $\epsilon^{-1}(v)$. This space $S^n_\epsilon$ is a spherical object in the proper category, $Proper_\infinity$.

For instance, take $T = \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$, made up of an infinite number of closed unit intervals (end-to-end), then $S^n_\epsilon$ will be the infinite string of spheres considered in the entry on the [[Brown-Grossmann homotopy groups]] if we take $\epsilon$ to be the identity function on $T^0$.
