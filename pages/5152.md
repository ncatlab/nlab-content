##Idea

Spherical objects in a general [[pointed category|pointed]]  [[model category]] play the role of the spheres in $Top$.


Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[pointed category|pointed]] [[model category]].

{: .un_defn}
######Definition######
A **spherical object** for $\mathcal{C}$ is a [[model category|cofibrant]] homotopy [[cogroup]] in $\mathcal{C}$.

##Examples

1. The spheres form the obvious examples of spherical objects in the category $Top$, but the rational spheres give other examples.

1. In the category of path connected pointed spaces with action of a discrete group, $Gr.Top^*_0$ and space of form $S^n_G= \bigvee_G S^n$ is a spherical object.(see Baues, 1991, ref. below, p.273).

1. Any rational sphere is a sphere object (in a suitable category for [[rational homotopy theory]]).
