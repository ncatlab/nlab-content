## Idea

The [[stable homotopy category]] $Ho(Spec)$ is a [[symmetric monoidal category]] via the [[symmetric smash product of spectra]]. Monoidal [[dual object|duality]] in $Ho(Spec)$ is called _Spanier-Whitehead duality_ or _[[S-duality]]_ .

## Examples

* For $X$ a [[compact space|compact]] [[smooth manifold]]. The dual of its [[suspension spectrum]] $\Sigma^\infty_+ X$ is given by the [[Thom spectrum]] $Th(N X)$ of its stable [[normal bundle]]. This is also called **Atiyah duality** (due to [Atiyah](#Atiyah)).

 The explicit interpretation in terms of monoidal duality is ([DoldPuppe, theorem 3.1](#DoldPuppe)).

  Using this one shows that the [[trace]] on the [[identity]] on $\Sigma^\infty_+ X$ -- its categorical [[dimension]] -- is the [[Euler characteristic]] of $X$.
