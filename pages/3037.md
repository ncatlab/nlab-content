## Idea

__Predicate logic__, also called __first-order logic__ and sometimes abbreviated __FOL__, is the usual sort of [[logic]] used in the [[foundations of mathematics]].  

In contrast to [[0th-order logic]], we allow for [[variables]] in [[predicates]] [[bound variable|bound]] by _[[quantification|quantifiers]]_. This means that the [[categorical semantics]] of 1st order logic is given by _[[hyperdoctrines]]_.

However, in contrast to [[higher-order logic]], we do not allow variables that stand for predicates themselves.  (This distinction can become somewhat confusing when the first-order theory in question is a [[material set theory]], such as [[ZFC]], in which the variables stand for "sets" which behave very much like predicates.)

A __predicate calculus__ is simply a system for describing and working with predicate logic.  The precise form of such a calculus (and hence of the logic itself) depends on whether one is using [[classical logic]], [[intuitionistic logic]], [[linear logic]], etc; see those articles for details.

For many (perhaps most?) authors, predicate logic is really __predicate logic with [[equality]]__.  However, some forms of predicate logic do not include an equality primitive, such as [[FOLDS]] (in whose name 'FOL' stands for 'first-order logic').  In some first-order theories, such as [[ZFC]], equality can be defined and so is not needed in the logic itself.

##Properties

The Swedish logician Per Lindström gave in 1969 important abstract characterisations of first-order logic ('abstract' in the sense of not referring to the syntactic make up of the formulas), e.g. a semantic one stating that the validity of the downward [[Löwenheim-Skolem theorem]] (a sentence that holds in some model already holds in an at most countable model) and the [[compactness theorem]] (a set of sentences has a model if every finite subset has a model) 'single out' first-order logic among all logics satisfying certain regularity conditions:  a gain in expressive power comes at the price of the loss of the validity of at least one of these theorems e.g. in second-order logic both theorems fail to hold. These results are sometimes viewed as an explanation of the privileged role that first-order logic plays in standard mathematical logic.
