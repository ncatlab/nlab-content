__Predicate logic__, also called __$1$st-order logic__, is the usual sort of [[logic]] used in the [[foundations of mathematics]].  In contrast to [[0th-order logic]], we allow for variables in [[predicates]] bound by [[quantification|quantifiers]].  However, in contrast to [[higher-order logic]], we do not allow variables that stand for predicates themselves.  (This distinction can become somewhat confusing when the first-order theory in question is a set theory, such as [[ZFC]], in which the variables stand for "sets" which behave very much like predicates.)

A __predicate calculus__ is simply a system for describing and working with predicate logic.  The precise form of such a calculus (and hence of the logic itself) depends on whether one is using [[classical logic]], [[intuitionistic logic]], [[linear logic]], etc; see those articles for details.

For many (perhaps most?) authors, predicate logic is really __predicate logic with [[equality]]__.  However, some forms of predicate logic do not include an equality primitive, such as [[FOLDS]] (in whose name 'FOL' stands for 'first-order logic').  In some first-order theories, such as [[ZFC]], equality can be defined and so is not needed in the logic itself.
