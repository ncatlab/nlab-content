_Algebraic Quantum Field Theory_ or _Axiomatic Quantum Field Theory_.

#Idea#

AQFT axiomatises the _Heisenberg picture_ of [[quantum field theory]] as [[FQFT]] axiomatizes the _Schr&ouml;dinger picture_.

The assignment of an _algebra of observables_ to a region of spacetime by a quantum field theory is formalized 
as a co-flabby co-[[presheaf]] of [[algebra|algebras]] on spacetime which satisfies a certain _locality_ axiom with respect to the Lorentzian structure of spacetime: 

* locality: algebras assigned to spacelike separated regions commute with each other when embedded into any joint superalgebra.

Such a local co-flabby co-presheaf of algebra is called a _local net_.

A good account of the mathematical axiomatics of AQFT is

* Hans Halvorson, Michael M&uuml;ger, _Algebraic Quantum Field Theory_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0602036))

This is, among other things, the ideal starting point for pure mathematicians who have always been left puzzled or otherwise unsatisfied by accounts of quantum field theory, even those tagged as being "for mathematicians". AQFT is truly axiomatic and rigorously formal. 

There is much more literature one should point to here, eventually. For instance for the connection between the AQFT axioms and the perturbative Feynman-integral techniques much used in [[quantum field theory]], see

* Romeo Brunetti, Michael Duetsch, Klaus Fredenhagen, _Perturbative Algebraic Quantum Field Theory and the Renormalization Groups_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/0901.2038))

Out of laziness for the moment I point for further references and more background to the introductory section of
