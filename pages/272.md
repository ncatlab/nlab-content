## Idea

**Algebraic Quantum Field Theory** or **Axiomatic Quantum Field Theory** or **AQFT** for short is a formalization of [[quantum field theory]] (and specifically full, hence [[non-perturbative quantum field theory]]) that axiomatizes the assignment of _[[algebras of observables]]_ to patches of parameter space ([[spacetime]], [[worldvolume]]) that one expects a quantum field theory to provide.

As such, the approach of AQFT is roughly dual to that of [[FQFT]], where instead _spaces of states_ are assigned to boundaries of [[cobordism]]s and propagation maps between state spaces to cobordisms themselves.

One may roughly think of AQFT as being a formalization of what in basic [[quantum mechanics]] textbooks is called the **[[Heisenberg picture]]** of quantum mechanics. On the other hand [[FQFT]] axiomatizes the _[[Schrödinger picture]]_ .

The axioms of traditional AQFT encode the properties of a [[local net]] of observables and are called the [[Haag-Kastler axioms]]. They are one of the oldest systems of axioms that seriously attempt to put [[quantum field theory]] on a solid conceptual footing. 

From the [[nPOV]] we may think of a [[local net]] as a co-flabby [[presheaf|copresheaf]] of [[algebra|algebras]] on spacetime which satisfies a certain _locality_ axiom with respect to the 
[[smooth Lorentzian manifold|Lorentzian structure]] of [[spacetime]]: 

* **locality:** algebras assigned to spacelike separated regions commute with each other when embedded into any joint superalgebra.

This is traditionally formulated (implicitly) as a structure in ordinary [[category theory]]. More recently, with the proof of the [[cobordism hypothesis]] and the corresponding [[(∞,n)-category]]-formulation of [[FQFT]] also [[higher category theory|higher categorical]] versions of systems of local algebras of observables are being put forward and studied. Three structures are curently being studied, that are all conceptually very similar and similar to the Haag-Kastler axioms:


* [[factorization algebra]]s

* [[topological chiral homology]]

* [[blob homology]].

On the other hand, all three of these encode what in physics are called _Euclidean_ quantum field theories, whereas only the notion of [[local net]] so far really incorporates crucially the fact that the underlying spacetime of a quantum field theory is a [[smooth Lorentzian space]].

In the context of the Haag-Kastler axioms there is a precise theorem, the [[Osterwalder-Schrader theorem]], relating the Euclidean to the Lorentzian formulation: this is the operation known as [[Wick rotation]].

## Examples
 {#Examples}

Examples of AQFT [[local nets of observables]] that encode interacting quantum field theories are not easy to construct. The construction of _free_ field theories is well understood, see the references [below](#ExamplesReferences). In [[perturbation theory]] also interacting theories can be constructed, see the references [here](#ReferencesPerturbationTheory).

### Free scalar field / Klein Gordon field
 {#FreeScalarField}

A survey of the AQFT description of the free scalar field on [[Minkowski spacetime]] is in ([Motoya, slides 11-17](#Montoya)). Discussion in more general context of [[AQFT on curved spacetimes]] in ([Brunetti-Fredenhagen, section 5.2](#BrunettiFredenhagen))

### Free fermion / Dirac field


The free [[fermion]] / Dirac field and its deformations is discussed for instance in ([DLM, section 3.2](#DLM)), ([Dimock 83](#Dimock82)).


### Electromagnetic field

The quantized [[electromagnetic field]] is discussed for instance in ([Dimock 92](#Dimock92)).

A good account of the mathematical axiomatics of Haag-Kastler AQFT is

* [[Hans Halvorson]], [[Michael Müger]], _Algebraic Quantum Field Theory_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0602036))

This is, among other things, the ideal starting point for pure mathematicians who have always been left puzzled or otherwise unsatisfied by accounts of quantum field theory, even those tagged as being "for mathematicians". AQFT is truly axiomatic and rigorously formal.

### Perturbation theory and renormalization
 {#ReferencesPerturbationTheory}

[[perturbation theory|Perturbation theory]] and [[renormalization]] in the context of AQFT and  is discussed in the following articles.

The observation that in [[perturbation theory]] the [[renormalization|Stückelberg-Bogoliubov-Epstein-Glaser]] local [[S-matrix|S-matrices]] yield a [[local net of observables]] was first made in 

* V. Il'in, D. Slavnov, _Observable algebras in the S-matrix approach_ Theor. Math. Phys. **36** , 32 (1978)
