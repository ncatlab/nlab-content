## Idea

What is called generalized Eilenberg-Steenrod cohomology is really the general _fully abelian_ subcase of [[cohomology]]. 

This means that generalized Eilenberg-Steenrod cohomology is the [[cohomology]] in an [[(∞,1)-category]] $\mathbf{H}$ that happens to be a [[stable (∞,1)-category]].

The archetypical example of this is $\mathbf{H} = Sp(Top)$, the [[stable (∞,1)-category of spectra]] and this is the context in which generalized Eilenberg-Steenrod cohomology is usually understood. So

Generalized Eilenberg-Steenrod cohomology is 
[[cohomology]] $H(X,A)$ with coefficient object $A$ a [[spectrum]].

## The Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms 

One may conceptualize the axioms as ensuring that certain nice properties that hold in the category Top will be preserved by our cohomology functor.

Let $U$ and $X$ be topological spaces, such that $U$ is a subspace of $X$. Notation: $(X,U) := U \hookrightarrow X$.

Note that if only one space is listed, the subspace is assumed to be the empty set $(X, \emptyset)$.

The Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms are the following:

###### Definition

A [[cohomology theory]] is a collection $\{A^n\}_{n \in \mathbb{Z}}$ of [[functor]]s

$$
  A^n : (Top^{\hookrightarrow})^{op} \to Ab
$$

from the [[homotopy category]] $Top^{\hookrightarrow}$ of pairs of [[topological space]]s to the category [[Ab]] of abelian groups, as well as a [[natural transformation]] $\delta: A^n(X, \emptyset) \to A^{n+1}(X, U)$. These functors and natural transformations satisfy and are characterized by the following axioms.

1. *Exactness*: The following sequence is exact. Note that the inclusions $U \hookrightarrow X$ and $(X, \emptyset) \hookrightarrow (X, U)$ induce the unlabeled arrows. 

$ \cdots \to A^n(X, U) \to A^n(X, \emptyset) \to A^n(U, \emptyset) \xrightarrow{\delta} A^{n+1}(X, U) \to \cdots $

1. *Weak homotopy equivalence*: if $f : X \to Y$ is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]] then $A^n(f) : A^n(Y) \to A^n(X)$ is an [[isomorphism]]

1. *Additivity*: If $ (X, U) = \coprod_i (X_i, U_i)$, then $A^n(X, U) = \coprod_i A^n(X_i, U_i)$.

1. *Excision*: Let $S$ be a subspace of $U$, the natural inclusion of the pair $i:(X-S, U-S) \hookrightarrow (X, U)$ induces an isomorphism $A^n(i): A^n(X-S, U-S) \to A^n(X, U)$.

Ordinary cohomology theories require and additional axiom, the dimension axiom $A^n(pt) = 0$.

## Examples 


* [[ordinary cohomology]]: [[Eilenberg–Mac Lane spectrum]]

* [[K-theory]]: [[K-theory spectrum]]
* [[tmf]]

* [[cobordism cohomology theory]]

* [[Morava K-theory]], [[integral Morava K-theory]]

* [[Morava E-theory]]

* [[stable cohomotopy]]

## Properties

### Expression by ordinary cohomology via Atiyah-Hirzebruch

The [[Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence]] serves to express generalized cohomology $E^\bullet$ in terms of ordinary cohomology with coefficients in $E^\bullet(\ast)$.

**remark** Originally Eilenberg and Steenrod had written down axioms that characterized the behaviour of ordinary integral cohomology, what is now understood to be cohomology with coefficients in the [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum]]. Generalized Eilenberg-Steenrod cohomology is originally defined as anything that satisfies this list of axioms except the first one. Later it was proven, by the [[Brown representability theorem]], that all the models for these axioms arise in terms of homotopy classes of maps into a [[spectrum]]. In our revisionist perspective above, we take this historically secondary point of view as the conceptually primary one.
