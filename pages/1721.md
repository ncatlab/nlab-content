## Idea
 {#Idea}

The collection of [[functors]] from ([[pointed topological space|pointed]]) [[topological spaces]] to [[abelian groups]] which assign [[cohomology groups]] of [[ordinary cohomology]] (e.g. [[singular cohomology]]) may be [[axiom|axiomatized]] by a small set of natural conditions, called the _Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms_ ([Eilenberg-Steenrod 52, I.3](#EilenbergSteenrod52)), see [below](#TheEilenbergSteenrodAxioms). One of these conditions, the "dimension axiom" ([Eilenberg-Steenrod 52, I.3 Axiom 7](#EilenbergSteenrod52)) says that the (co)homology groups assigned to the point are concentrated in degree 0. The class of functors obtained by discarding this "dimension axiom" came to be known as _generalized (co)homology theories_ ([Whitehead 62](#Whitehead62)) or _extraordinary (co)homology theories_. 

Examples include [[topological K-theory]] ([Atiyah-Hirzebruch 61, 1.8](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/topological+K-theory#AtiyahHirzebruch61)), [[elliptic cohomology]] and [[cobordism cohomology theory]]. Dually one speaks of _[[generalized homology]]_.

Notice that, while the terminology "generalized cohomology" is standard in [[algebraic topology]] with an eye towards [[stable homotopy theory]], it is somewhat unfortunate in that there are various _other_ and _further_ generalizations of the axioms that all still deserve to be and are called "[[cohomology]]". For instance dropping the [[suspension isomorphism|suspension]] axiom leads to [[nonabelian cohomology]] and dropping the "homotopy axiom" (and taking the domain spaces to be [[smooth manifolds]]) leads to the further generality of [[differential cohomology]]. 
This entry here is concerned with the generalization obtained from the Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms by _just_ discarding the dimension axiom. For lack of a better term, we say "generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology" here.

In ([Whitehead 62](#Whitehead62)) it was observed that every [[spectrum]] induces a generalized homology theory.  The _[[Brown representability theorem]]_ ([Brown 62](#Brown62)) asserts that every generalized (co)homology arises this way, being [[representable functor|represented]] by [[mapping spectra]] into/[[smash product]] with a [[spectrum]].  But beware that the cohomology theory represented by a spectrum in general contains strictly less information than the spectrum, due to the existence of "[[phantom maps]]".

On the other hand, if one refines the concept of a generalized homology theory from taking values in graded abelian groups to taking values in [[homotopy types]] then it does become equivalent to the concept of _spectrum_, this is the statement at _[excisive functor -- Examples -- Spectrum objects](excisive+%28∞%2C1%29-functor#SpectrumObjects)_.

This means that from a perspective of [[higher category theory]], generalized Eilenberg-Steenrod cohomology is the intrinsic [[cohomology]] of the [[(∞,1)-category of spectra]], or better: [[twisted cohomology|twisted]] generalized Eilenberg-Steenrod cohomology is the intrinsic cohomology of the [[tangent (∞,1)-topos]] of [[parameterized spectra]].


+-- {: .standout}

Generalized Eilenberg-Steenrod cohomology is 
[[cohomology]] $E(X)= H(X,E)$ with [[coefficients]] $E$ a [[spectrum object]].

## Classical formulation 
 {#TheEilenbergSteenrodAxioms}

This sections states the classical formulation of the Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms due to ([Eilenberg-Steenrod 52, I.3](#EilenbergSteenrod52)) in terms of concepts from classical [[algebraic topology]], such as [[CW-pairs]] and [[mapping cones]]. 

More abstractly, via the [[classical model structure on topological spaces]], these structures are seen to serve as presentations for certain [[homotopy pushouts]]. In terms of "abstract homotopy theory" ([[(infinity,1)-category theory]]) one obtains a more streamlined formulation, which we turn to [below](#AbstractFormulation).

$\,$

There are two versions of the statement of the axioms:

* _[Reduced cohomology](#ReducedCohomology)_;

* _[Unreduced cohomology](#UnreducedCohomology)_.

There are functors taking any reduced cohomology theory to an unreduced one, and vice versa. When some fine detail in the axioms is suitably set up, then this establishes an [[equivalence of categories|equivalence]] between reduced and unreduced generalized cohomology:

* _[Relation between reduced and unreduced cohomology](#RelationBetweenReducedAndUnreduced)_

The fine detail in the axioms that makes this work is such as to ensure that a cohomology theory is a functor on the [[opposite category|opposite]] of the (pointed/pairwise) [[classical homotopy category]]. Since this has different presentations, there are corresponding different versions of suitable axioms:

1. On the one hand, $Ho(Top_{Quillen})$ may be presented by topological spaces homeomorphic to [[CW-complexes]] and with [[homotopy equivalence]]-classes of continuous functions between them, and accordingly a generalized cohomology theory may be taken to be a funtor on (pointed/pairs of) CW-complexes invariant under [[homotopy equivalence]].

1. On the other hand, $Ho(Top_{Quillen})$ may be presented by all topological spaces with [[weak homotopy equivalences]] [[localization|inverted]], and accordingly a generalized cohomology theory may be taken to be a functor on all (pointed/pairs of) topological spaces that sends weak homotopy equivalences to isomorphisms.

Notice however that "[[classical homotopy category]]" is already ambiguous. Pre Quillen this was the category of _all_ topological spaces with homotopy equivalence classes of maps between them, and often generalized cohomology functors are defined on this larger category and only restricted to CW-complexes or required to preserve weak homotopy equivalences when need be (e.g. [Switzer 75, p.117](#Switzer75)), such as for establishing the equivalence between reduced and unreduced theories.

Moreover, historically, these conditions have been decomposed in several numbers of ways. Notably ([Eilenberg-Steenrod 52](#EilenbergSteenrod52)) originally listed 7 axioms for unreduced cohomology, more than typically counted today, but their axioms 1 and 2 jointly just said that we have a functor on topological spaces, axiom 3 was the condition for the connecting homomorphism to be a [[natural transformation]], conditions which later ([Switzer 75, p. 99,100](#Switzer75)) were absorbed in the underlying structure. 

Finally, following the historical development it is common to state the exactness properties of cohomology functors in terms of [[mapping cone]] constructions. These are models for [[homotopy cofibers]], but in general only when some technical conditions are met, such that the underlying topological spaces are CW-complexes. 

For these reasons, in the following we stick to two points of views: where we discuss cohomology theories as functors on topological spaces we restrict attention to those homeomorphic to CW-complexes. In a second description we speak fully abstractly about functors on the homotopy category of a given model category of $\infty$-category.

### Reduced cohomology
 {#ReducedCohomology}

Throughout, write [[Top]]${}_{CW}$ for the category of [[topological spaces]] [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to [[CW-complexes]]. Write $Top^{\ast/}_{CW}$ for the corresponding category of [[pointed topological spaces]]. 

Recall that [[colimits]] in $Top^{\ast/}$ are computed as colimits in $Top$ after adjoining the base point and its inclusion maps top the given diagram

+-- {: .num_example #WedgeSumAsCoproduct}
###### Example

The [[coproduct]] in [[pointed topological spaces]] is the _[[wedge sum]]_, denoted $\vee_{i \in I} X_i$.

Write

$$
  \Sigma \coloneqq S^1 \wedge (-)
  \;\colon\;
  Top^{\ast/}_{CW} \longrightarrow Top^{\ast/}_{CW}
$$

for the [[reduced suspension]] functor.

Write $Ab^{\mathbb{Z}}$ for the category of integer-[[graded abelian groups]].

+-- {: .num_defn #ReducedGeneralizedCohomology}
###### Definition

A **reduced [[cohomology theory]]** is a [[functor]]

$$
  \tilde E^\bullet 
   \;\colon\; 
  (Top^{\ast/}_{CW})^{op} \longrightarrow Ab^{\mathbb{Z}}
$$

from the [[opposite category|opposite]] of [[pointed topological spaces]] ([[CW-complexes]]) to $\mathbb{Z}$-[[graded abelian groups]] ("[[cohomology groups]]"), in components

$$

and equipped with a [[natural isomorphism]] of degree +1, to be called the **[[suspension isomorphism]]**, of the form

$$

such that:

1. **([[homotopy invariance]])** If $f_1,f_2 \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ are two morphisms of pointed topological spaces such that there is a (base point preserving) [[homotopy]] $f_1 \simeq f_2$ between them, then the induced [[homomorphisms]] of abelian groups are [[equality|equal]] 

   $$
     f_1^\ast = f_2^\ast
     \,.
   $$

1. {#ReducedExactnessAxiom} **(exactness)** For $i \colon A \hookrightarrow X$ an inclusion of pointed topological spaces, with $j \colon X \longrightarrow Cone(i)$ the induced [[mapping cone]], then this gives an [[exact sequence]] of graded abelian groups

     \tilde E^\bullet(Cone(i)) 
      \overset{j^\ast}{\longrightarrow} 
     \tilde E^\bullet(X)
       \overset{i^\ast}{\longrightarrow}
     \tilde E^\bullet(A)
     \,.
   $$

We say $\tilde E^\bullet$ is **additive** if in addition

* **([[wedge axiom]])** For $\{X_i\}_{i \in I} $ any set of pointed CW-complexes, then the canonical morphism

  $$
    \tilde E^\bullet(\vee_{i \in I} X_i) 
    \longrightarrow
    \prod_{i \in I} \tilde E^\bullet(X_i)
  $$

  from the functor applied to their [[wedge sum]], example \ref{WedgeSumAsCoproduct}, to the [[product]] of its values on the wedge summands, is an [[isomorphism]].

We say $\tilde E^\bullet$ is **ordinary** if its value on the [[0-sphere]] $S^0$ is concentrated in degree 0:

* **(Dimension)**  $\tilde E^{\bullet\neq 0}(\mathbb{S}^0) \simeq 0$.

We may rephrase this more intrinsically and more generally:

###### Definition

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an [[(∞,1)-category]] with [[(∞,1)-pushouts]], and with a [[zero object]] $0 \in \mathcal{C}$. Write $\Sigma \colon \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}\colon X\mapsto 0 \underset{X}{\sqcup} 0$ for the corresponding [[suspension]] [[(∞,1)-functor]].

A **reduced generalized cohomology theory** on $\mathcal{C}$ is

   $$
     \sigma \; \colon \; H^\bullet \longrightarrow H^{\bullet+1} \circ \Sigma

### Unreduced cohomology
 {#UnreducedCohomology}

In the following a _pair_ $(X,U)$ refers to a [[subspace]] inclusion of [[topological spaces]] ([[CW-complexes]])  $U \hookrightarrow X$.  Whenever only one space is mentioned, the subspace is assumed to be the [[empty set]] $(X, \emptyset)$. Write $Top_{CW}^{\hookrightarrow}$ for the category of such pairs (the [[full subcategory]] of the [[arrow category]] of $Top_{CW}$ on the inclusions). We identify $Top_{CW} \hookrightarrow Top_{CW}^{\hookrightarrow}$ by $X \mapsto (X,\emptyset)$.


+-- {: .num_defn #GeneralizedCohomologyTheory}
###### Definition

A _[[cohomology theory]]_ (unreduced) is a [[functor]]

$$
  E^\bullet : (Top_{CW}^{\hookrightarrow})^{op} \to Ab^{\mathbb{Z}}
$$

to the category of $\mathbb{Z}$-[[graded abelian groups]], as well as a [[natural transformation]] of degree +1, to be called the **[[connecting homomorphism]]**, of the form

$$
  \delta_{(X,U)} 
    \;\colon\;  
  E^\bullet(U, \emptyset) \to E^{\bullet + 1}(X, U)
  \,.
$$ 

such that:

1. **(homotopy invariance)** For $f \colon (X_1,U_1) \to (X_2,U_2)$ a [[homotopy equivalence]] of pairs, then 

   $$
     E^\bullet(f) 
      \;\colon\; 
     E^\bullet(X_2,U_2) \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} E^\bullet(X_1,U_1)
   $$

   is an [[isomorphism]];

1. {#ExactnessUnreduced} **(exactness)** For $U \hookrightarrow X$ the induced sequence

   $$ 
     \cdots 
       \to 
     E^n(X, U) 
       \longrightarrow 
     E^n(X) 
       \longrightarrow
     E^n(U) 
       \stackrel{\delta}{\longrightarrow} 
     E^{n+1}(X, U) 
       \to 
     \cdots 
   $$

   is a [[long exact sequence]] of [[abelian groups]].

1. **([[excision]])** For $U \hookrightarrow A \hookrightarrow X$ such that $\overline{U} \subset Int(A)$, then the natural inclusion of the pair $i \colon (X-U, A-U) \hookrightarrow (X, A)$ induces an isomorphism 

   $$
     E^\bullet(i) 
      \;\colon\; 
     E^n(X, A)
      \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
     E^n(X-U, A-U)  
   $$

We say $E^\bullet$ is **additive** if it takes [[coproducts]] to [[products]]:

* **(additivity)** If $ (X, U) = \coprod_i (X_i, U_i)$, then the canonical comparison morphism gives $E^n(X, U) \simeq \prod_i E^n(X_i, U_i)$.

We say $E^\bullet$ is **ordinary** if its value on the point is concentrated in degree 0

* **(Dimension)**: $E^{\bullet \neq 0}(\ast,\emptyset) = 0$.

=--

e.g. ([AGP 02, def. 12.1.1 ](#AguilarGitlerPrieto02)). 


The following lemma shows that the dependence in pairs of spaces in a generalized cohomology theory is really a stand-in for evaluation on [[homotopy cofibers]] of inclusions.

+-- {: .num_lemma #EvaluationOfCohomologyTheoryOnGoodPairIsEvaluationOnQuotient}
###### Lemma

Let $E^\bullet$ be an cohomology theory, def. \ref{GeneralizedCohomologyTheory}, and let $A \hookrightarrow X$. Then there is an isomorphism 

$$
  E^\bullet(X,A)
    \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  E^\bullet(X \cup Cone(A), \ast)
$$

between the value of $E^\bullet$ on the pair $(X,A)$ and its value on the [[mapping cone]] of the inclusion, relative to a basepoint.

If moreover $A \hookrightarrow X$ is (the [[retract]] of) a [[relative cell complex]] inclusion, then also morphism in cohomology induced from the [[quotient]] map $p \;\colon\; (X,A)\longrightarrow (X/A, \ast)$ is an [[isomorphism]]:

$$
  E^\bullet(p)
    \;\colon\; 
  E^\bullet(X/A,\ast)
    \longrightarrow
  E^\bullet(X,A)
  \,.
$$

=--

(e.g [AGP 02, corollary 12.1.10](#AguilarGitlerPrieto02))


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Consider $U \coloneqq (Cone(A)-A \times \{0\}) \hookrightarrow Cone(A)$, the cone on $A$ minus the base $A$. We have

$$
  ( X\cup Cone(A)-U, Cone(A)-U) \simeq (X,A)
$$

and hence the first isomorphism in the statement is given by the excision axiom.

Next consider the quotient of the [[mapping cone]] of the inclusion:

$$
  ( X\cup Cone(A), Cone(A) ) \longrightarrow (X/A,\ast)
  \,.
$$

If $A \hookrightarrow X$ is a cofibration, then this is a [[homotopy equivalence]] since $Cone(A)$ is contractible and since by the dual [[factorization lemma]] $X \cup Cone(A)\to X/A$ is a weak homotopy equivalence, hence a homotopy equivalence on CW-complexes.

Hence now we get a composite isomorphism

$$
  E^\bullet(X/A,\ast)
    \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  E^\bullet( X\cup Cone(A), Cone(A) )
    \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}

$$
  E^\bullet(X) \simeq \tilde E^\bullet(X) \oplus E^\bullet(\ast)
$$

of the unreduced cohomology of $X$ with the [[direct sum]] of the reduced cohomology of $X$ and the unreduced cohomology of the base point.

###### Proof

The pair $\ast \hookrightarrow X$ induces the sequence

$$
  \cdots
   \to 
  E^{\bullet-1}(\ast)
    \stackrel{\delta}{\longrightarrow}
  \tilde E^\bullet(X)
    \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}
  E^\bullet(X) 
    \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}
  E^\bullet(\ast)
    \stackrel{\delta}{\longrightarrow}
  \tilde E^{\bullet+1}(X)
    \to
  \cdots
$$

which by the exactness clause in def. \ref{GeneralizedCohomologyTheory} is [[exact sequence|exact]]. 

Now since the composite $\ast \to X \to \ast$ is the identity, the morphism 
$E^\bullet(X) \to E^\bullet(\ast)$ has a [[section]] and so is in particular an [[epimorphism]]. Therefore, by exactness, the [[connecting homomorphism]] vanishes, $\delta = 0$ and we have a [[short exact sequence]]

$$
  0 
    \to 
  \tilde E^\bullet(X)
    \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}
  E^\bullet(X) 
    \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}
  E^\bullet(\ast)
    \to
  0
$$

with the right map an epimorphism. Hence this is a [[split exact sequence]] and the statement follows.

## Brown functoriality

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

Given a generalized cohomology functor $H^\bullet \colon Ho(\mathcal{C})^{op}\to Ab^{\mathbb{Z}}$, def. \ref{GeneralizedCohomologyOnGeneralInfinityCategory}, its underlying [[Set]]-valued functors $H^n \colon Ho(\mathcal{C})^{op}\to Ab\to Set$ are [[Brown functors]], def. \ref{BrownFunctorOnInfinityCategory}.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The first condition on a [[Brown functor]] holds by definition of $H^\bullet$. For the second condition, given a homotopy pushout square


$$
  \array{
    X_1 &\stackrel{f_1}{\longrightarrow}& Y_1
    \\
    \downarrow^{} && \downarrow
    \\
    X_2 &\stackrel{f_2}{\longrightarrow}& Y_2
  }
$$

in $\mathcal{C}$, consider the induced morphism of the [[long exact sequences]] given by prop. \ref{LongExactSequenceOfACohomologyTheoryOnAnInfinityCategory}

$$
  \array{
    H^\bullet(coker(f_2))
      &\longrightarrow&
    H^\bullet(Y_2) 
      &\stackrel{f^\ast_2}{\longrightarrow}& 
    H^\bullet(X_2)
      &\stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}&
    H^{\bullet+1}(\Sigma coker(f_2))
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\simeq}}\downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    \\
    H^\bullet(coker(f_1))
      &\longrightarrow&
    H^\bullet(Y_1) 
      &\stackrel{f^\ast_1}{\longrightarrow}& 
    H^\bullet(X_1)
      &\stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}&
    H^{\bullet+1}(\Sigma coker(f_1))
  }
$$

Here the outer vertical morphisms are [[isomorphisms]], as shown, due to the [[pasting law]] (see also at _[fiberwise recognition of stable homotopy pushouts](homotopy+pullback#FiberwiseRecognitionInStableCase)_). 

This means that the [[four lemma]] applies to this diagram. Inspection shows that this implies the claim.

## Properties



### Expression by ordinary cohomology via Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence

The [[Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence]] serves to express generalized cohomology $E^\bullet$ in terms of ordinary cohomology with coefficients in $E^\bullet(\ast)$.

### Whitehead theorem
 {#WhiteheadTheorem}

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Let $\phi \colon E \longrightarrow F$ be a morphism of reduced generalized (co-)homology functors, def. \ref{ReducedGeneralizedCohomology} (a [[natural transformation]]) such that its component

$$
  \phi(S^0) \colon E(S^0) \longrightarrow F(S^0)
$$

on the [[0-sphere]] is an [[isomorphism]]. Then $\phi(X)\colon E(X)\to F(X)$ is an [[isomorphism]] for $X$ any [[CW-complex]] with a [[finite number]] of cells. If both $E$ and $F$ satisfy the [[wedge axiom]], then $\phi(X)$ is an isomorphism for $X$ any [[CW-complex]], not necessarily finite.

=--


For $E$ and $F$ [[ordinary cohomology]]/[[ordinary homology]] functors a proof of this is in ([Eilenberg-Steenrod 52, section III.10](#EilenbergSteenrod52)). From this the general statement follows (e.g. [Kochman 96, theorem 3.4.3, corollary 4.2.8](#Kochman96)) via the [[natural transformation|naturality]] of the [[Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence]] (the classical result gives that $\phi$ induces an isomorphism between the second pages of the AHSSs for $E$ and $F$).
