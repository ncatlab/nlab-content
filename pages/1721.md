## Idea
 {#Idea}

The collection of [[functors]] from ([[pointed topological space|pointed]]) [[topological spaces]] to [[abelian groups]] which assign [[cohomology groups]] in some degree of [[ordinary cohomology]] (e.g. [[singular cohomology]]) may be [[axiom|axiomatized]] by a small set of natural conditions, called the _Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms_, see [below](#TheEilenbergSteenrodAxioms). One of these conditions says that the cohomology groups assigned to the point are concentrated in degree 0. The class of functors obtained by discarding this "dimension axiom" came to be known as _generalized cohomology theories_ ([Whitehead 62](#Whitehead62)) or _extraordinary cohomology theories_. 

Examples include [[topological K-theory]], [[elliptic cohomology]] and [[cobordism cohomology theory]]. Dually one speaks of _[[generalized homology]]_.

Notice that, while the terminology "generalized cohomology" is standard in [[algebraic topology]] with an eye towards [[stable homotopy theory]], it is somewhat unfortunate in that there are various _further_ generalizations of the axioms that all still deserve to be and are called "cohomology". For instance dropping the [[suspension isomorphism|suspension]] axiom leads to [[nonabelian cohomology]] and dropping the "homotopy axiom" (and taking the domain spaces to be [[smooth manifolds]]) leads to the further generality of [[differential cohomology]]. 
This entry here is concerned with the generalization obtained from the Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms by _just_ discarding the dimension axiom. For lack of a better term, we say "generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology" here.

The _[[Brown representability theorem]]_ asserts that generalized cohomology theories in this sense here are precisely those functors that are [[representable functor|represented]] by [[spectra]]. (But beware that the cohomology theory represented by a spectrum in general contains strictly less information than the spectrum, due to the existence of "[[phantom maps]]").

This means that from a perspective of [[higher category theory]], generalized Eilenberg-Steenrod cohomology is the intrinsic [[cohomology]] of the [[(∞,1)-category of spectra]], or better: [[twisted cohomology|twisted]] generalized Eilenberg-Steenrod cohomology is the intrinsic cohomology of the [[tangent (∞,1)-topos]] of [[parameterized spectra]].

Generalized Eilenberg-Steenrod cohomology is 
[[cohomology]] $E(X)= H(X,E)$ with [[coefficients]] $E$ a [[spectrum object]].

## The Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms 
 {#TheEilenbergSteenrodAxioms}

One may conceptualize the axioms as ensuring that certain nice properties that hold in the category $Top$ will be preserved by the cohomology functor.

### Reduced cohomology
 {#ReducedCohomology}

+-- {: .num_defn #ReducedGeneralizedCohomology}
###### Definition

A _reduced generalized [[cohomology theory]]_ is a $\mathbb{Z}$-[[graded object|graded]]  [[functor]]

$$
  \tilde E^\bullet \colon (Top^{\ast/})^{op} \longrightarrow Ab
$$

from the [[opposite category]] of [[pointed topological spaces]] ([[CW-complexes]]) to [[abelian groups]] 

$$
  \tilde E 
    \;\colon\; 
  (X \stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow} Y)
    \mapsto
  (\tilde E^\bullet(Y) 
    \stackrel{f^\ast}{\longrightarrow}
  \tilde E^\bullet(X))
$$

and equipped with [[natural isomorphisms]], to be called the _[[suspension isomorphism]]_

$$
  \tilde E^\bullet(-) \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} \tilde E^{\bullet +1}(\Sigma -) 
$$

(for $\Sigma \colon Top^{\ast/} \to Top^{\ast/}$ the [[reduced suspension]] functor)

such that:

1. **Homotopy invariance** If $f_1,f_2 \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ are two morphisms of pointed topological spaces such that there is a (base point preserving) [[homotopy]] $f_1 \simeq f_2$ between them, then the induced [[homomorphisms]] of abelian groups are [[equality|equal]] 

   $$
     f_1^\ast = f_2^\ast
     \,.
   $$

1. **Exactness** For $i \colon A \hookrightarrow$ an inclusion of pointed topological spaces, with $j \colon X \longrightarrow cone(i)$ the induced [[mapping cone]], then this gives an [[exact sequence]] of graded abelian groups

   $$
     \tilde E^\bullet(cone(i)) 
      \stackrel{j^\ast}{\longrightarrow} 
     \tilde E^\bullet(X)
       \stackrel{i^\ast}{\longrightarrow}
     \tilde E^\bullet(A)
     \,.
   $$

###### Definition

A reduced generalized cohomology theory $\tilde E^\bullet$, def. \ref{ReducedGeneralizedCohomology}, is called _ordinary_ if

* **dimension** $\tilde E^{\bullet\neq 0}(\mathbb{S}^0) \simeq 0$.

### Unreduced cohomology

In the following a _pair_ $(X,U)$ refers to a [[subspace]] inclusion of [[topological spaces]]  $U \hookrightarrow X$.  Whenever only one space is mentioned, the subspace is assumed to be the [[empty set]] $(X, \emptyset)$.



+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A _[[cohomology theory]]_ (unreduced) is a collection $\{E^n\}_{n \in \mathbb{Z}}$ of $\mathbb{Z}$-[[graded object|graded]] [[functors]]

$$
  E^n : (Top^{\hookrightarrow})^{op} \to Ab
$$

from the [[homotopy category]] $Top^{\hookrightarrow}$ of pairs of [[topological spaces]] to the category [[Ab]] of abelian groups, as well as a [[natural transformation]] $\delta: A^n(X, \emptyset) \to A^{n+1}(X, U)$. These functors and natural transformations satisfy and are characterized by the following axioms.

1. **Exactness**: The following sequence is exact. Note that the inclusions $U \hookrightarrow X$ and $(X, \emptyset) \hookrightarrow (X, U)$ induce the unlabeled arrows. 

$ \cdots \to E^n(X, U) \to E^n(X, \emptyset) \to E^n(U, \emptyset) \xrightarrow{\delta} E^{n+1}(X, U) \to \cdots $

1. **Homotopy equivalence**: if $f : X \to Y$ is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]] then $E^n(f) : E^n(Y) \to E^n(X)$ is an [[isomorphism]]

1. **Additivity**: If $ (X, U) = \coprod_i (X_i, U_i)$, then $E^n(X, U) = \coprod_i E^n(X_i, U_i)$.

1. **Excision**: Let $S$ be a subspace of $U$, the natural inclusion of the pair $i:(X-S, U-S) \hookrightarrow (X, U)$ induces an isomorphism $E^n(i) \colon E^n(X-S, U-S) \to E^n(X, U)$.

A generalized cohomology theory is called _ordinary_ if in addition 

* **Dimension**: $E^n(pt) = 0$.

## Examples 


* [[ordinary cohomology]]: [[Eilenberg–Mac Lane spectrum]]

* [[K-theory]]: [[K-theory spectrum]]
* [[tmf]]

* [[cobordism cohomology theory]]

* [[Morava K-theory]], [[integral Morava K-theory]]

* [[Morava E-theory]]

* [[stable cohomotopy]]

## Properties

### Expression by ordinary cohomology via Atiyah-Hirzebruch

The [[Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence]] serves to express generalized cohomology $E^\bullet$ in terms of ordinary cohomology with coefficients in $E^\bullet(\ast)$.

**remark** Originally Eilenberg and Steenrod had written down axioms that characterized the behaviour of ordinary integral cohomology, what is now understood to be cohomology with coefficients in the [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum]]. Generalized Eilenberg-Steenrod cohomology is originally defined as anything that satisfies this list of axioms except the first one. Later it was proven, by the [[Brown representability theorem]], that all the models for these axioms arise in terms of homotopy classes of maps into a [[spectrum]]. In our revisionist perspective above, we take this historically secondary point of view as the conceptually primary one.
