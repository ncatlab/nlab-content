## Idea

[[homotopy type theory|Homotopy type theory]] has [[categorical semantics]] in suitable [[homotopical categories]] which in turn present certain [[(infinity,1)-categories]].

The concept of _type-theoretic model category_ ([Shulman 12a](#Shulman12a)) or _type-theoretic fibration category_ ([Shulman 12b, def. 2.1](#Shulman12b)) is one particular way of making this precise. Specifically every [[locally presentable (∞,1)-category|locally presentable]] [[locally cartesian closed (∞,1)-category]] has a presentation by a type-theoretic model category, hence provides higher [[categorical semantics]] for [[homotopy type theory]] (without possibly [[univalence]]). For more on this see also the respective sections at _[[relation between type theory and category theory]]_.

## Definition

> under construction

By decomposing the structure in homotopy type theory in layers as

1. [[dependent type theory]]

2. with [[identity types]]

3. and [[univalence|univalent]] [[universe]] types.

A 1-[[category]] whose [[internal logic]] can interpret this needs to 

1. be a [[locally cartesian closed category]]

2. equipped with a [[weak factorization system]] with [[stable path objects]], such that [[acyclic cofibrations]] are preserved by [[pullback]] along [[fibrations]] between [[fibrant objects]]. 

3. (needs to be finished)
