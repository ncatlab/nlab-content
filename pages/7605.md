## Idea

[[homotopy type theory|Homotopy type theory]] has [[categorical semantics]] in suitable categories which in turn present certain [[(infinity,1)-categories]].

Decomposing the structure in homotopy type theory in layers as

1. [[dependent type theory]]

1. with [[identity types]]

1. and [[univalence|univalent]] [[universe]] types.

a 1-[[category]] whose [[internal logic]] can interpret this needs to 

1. be a [[locally cartesian closed category]]

1. equipped with a [[weak factorization system]] with [[stable path objects]], such that [[acyclic cofibrations]] are preserved by [[pullback]] along [[fibrations]] between [[fibrant objects]].
