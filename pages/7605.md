## Idea

[[homotopy type theory|Homotopy type theory]] has [[categorical semantics]] in suitable [[homotopical categories]] which in turn present certain [[(infinity,1)-categories]].

The concept of _type-theoretic model category_ ([Shulman 12a](#Shulman12a)) or _type-theoretic fibration category_ ([Shulman 12b, def. 2.1](#Shulman12b)) is one particular way of making this precise. Specifically every [[locally presentable (∞,1)-category|locally presentable]] [[locally cartesian closed (∞,1)-category]] has a presentation by a type-theoretic model category, hence provides higher [[categorical semantics]] for [[homotopy type theory]] (without possibly [[univalence]]). For more on this see also the respective sections at _[[relation between type theory and category theory]]_.

## Definition

> under construction

By decomposing the structure in homotopy type theory in layers as

1. [[dependent type theory]]

2. with [[identity types]]

3. and [[univalence|univalent]] [[universe]] types.

A 1-[[category]] whose [[internal logic]] can interpret this needs to 

1. be a [[locally cartesian closed category]]

2. equipped with a [[weak factorization system]] with [[stable path objects]], such that [[acyclic cofibrations]] are preserved by [[pullback]] along [[fibrations]] between [[fibrant objects]]. 

3. (needs to be finished)

## Properties

### Function extensionality

+-- {: .num_prop #FunExtInFibrationCat}
###### Proposition

[[function extensionality|Function extensionality]] holds in the [[internal language|internal]] [[type theory]] of a [[type-theoretic fibration category]] precisely if [[dependent products]] (i.e. right [[base change]]) along [[fibrations]] preserve [[acyclic fibrations]].

###### Example

The condition in prop. \ref{FunExtInFibrationCat} holds in particular in [[right proper model category|right proper]] [[Cisinski model structures]], since in these right [[base change]] along fibrations is a [[right Quillen functor]] (see e.g. the proof <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/locally+cartesian+closed+(infinity,1)-category#PresentationTheorem">here</a>). 

Notice that every [[presentable (∞,1)-category|presentable]] [[locally Cartesian closed (∞,1)-category]] (by the discussion <a href="locally+cartesian+closed+(infinity,1)-category#PresentationTheorem">there</a>) has a presentation by a [[right proper model category|right proper]] [[Cisinski model category]]. Accordingly we may say that every [[presentable (∞,1)-category|presentable]] [[locally Cartesian closed (∞,1)-category]] interprets [[HoTT]]+FunExt.
