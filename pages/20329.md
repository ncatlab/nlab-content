## Definition

Given two [[groups]] $G_1$ and $G_2$ and a joint [[subgroup]] $C \xhookrightarrow{\iota_i} Z(G_i)$ in each of their [[centers]], then the corresponding ("external") _central product_ is the [[quotient group]]

$$
  G_1 \circ G_2
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \big( 
    G_1 \times G_2
  \big)/_{diag} C
$$

of the [[direct product group]] $G_1 \times G_2$ by the [[diagonal]] subgroup $C \xhookrightarrow{(\iota_1, \iota_2)} G_1 \times G_2$.

([Gornestein 80, p. 29](#Gornestein80))

Beware that there is no widely accepted conventnotation for the central product, and that most notational conventions supporess the choices of central subgroups involved.  The "$\circ$"-notation is popular in [[finite group]]-theory, while in [[Riemannian geometry]] people tend to use "$\cdot$" (see [[Sp(n).Sp(1)]]) or no symbol at all.

Also beware that most texts insists on stating the choices as that of two separate subgroups $C_i \xhookrightarrow{\iota_i} G_i$ together with an [[isomorphism]] $C_1 \xrightarrow[\simeq]{\phi} C_2$ between them.

## Examples

### In Riemannian geometry and spin geometry

In [[Riemannian geometry]] and [[spin geometry]] one considers the central products [[Sp(n).Sp(1)]] and [[Spin(n).Spin(m)]].
