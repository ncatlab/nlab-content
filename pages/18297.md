## Idea

**Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé games** are a technique in [[model theory]] for
studying whether to structures are elementary equivalent. Variations
can be used to study equivalence with respect to logics other than first-order logic.

The games are played by two players: the _spoiler_, whose objective is
to establish a difference between the two structures, and the
_duplicator_, whose objective is to show that the two structures are
similar.

A game is played in turns for a number of rounds (in general an
ordinal, but usually a finite number or $\omega$). In each round the
spoiler picks an element of one of the structures and then the
duplicator responds by picking an element of the other structure. At
the end of the game they have together selected two sequences of equal length of elements of the two structures, and the duplicator wins
if the sequences generate isomorphic substructures of the given
structures. (See below for variations in the winning conditions.)
