## Idea

In the context of [[quantum field theory]], a _renormalization scheme_ is a method in [[renormalization]] of [[local Lagrangian]] theory for systematically producing [[counterterms]].

A choice of renormalization scheme amounts to a choice of decomposition, as [[vector spaces]] of $C^\infty((0,\infty))$ as a [[direct sum]] $C^\infty([0,\infty)) \oplus Sing$, where $Sing$ is a space of functions that are singular at 0.
