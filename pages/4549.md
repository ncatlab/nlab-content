## Idea

Given [[connection on a bundle]] $\nabla$ over a [[space]] $X$, its [[parallel transport]] around some loop $\gamma : [0,1] \to X$, $\gamma(0) = \gamma(1) = x_0$ yields an element 

$$
  hol_\nabla(\gamma) \in G
$$ 

in the [[automorphism group]] of the [[fiber]] $P_{x_0}$ of the bundle. This is the **holonomy** of $\nabla$ around $\gamma$.

Fixing a connection $\nabla$ and a point $x \in X$ the collection of all elements $hol_\nabla(\gamma)$ for all loops $\gamma$ based at $x$ forms a subgroup of $G$, called the [[holonomy group]].

If the [[Levi-Civita connection]] on a [[Riemannian manifold]] $(X,g)$ has a holonomy group that is a proper subgroup of the [[special orthogonal group]] one says that $(X,g)$ is a manifold with [[special holonomy]]. (More precise would be: "with special holonomy group for the Levi-Civita connection".)

## Properties

Proposition. If on a smooth principal bundle $P\to X$ there is a connection $\nabla$ whose holonomy group is $G$ then the structure group can be reduced to $G$.

###### Theorem
**(Ambrose-Singer)**
[[Ambrose-Singer theorem]]: the [[Lie algebra]] of the holonomy group of a [[connection on a bundle]] $\nabla$ on $X$ at a point $x \in X$ is spanned by the [[parallel transport]] $Ad_{tra_\nabla(\gamma)}(F_A(v \vee w))$ of the [[curvature]] $F_A$ evaluated on any $v \vee w \in \wedge^2 T_y X$ at $y \in X$ along any path $\gamma$ from $x \to y$.
=--

We may think of $Id + \Ad_{tra_\nabla(\gamma)}(F_A(\phi))$ as being the holonomy around the loop obtained by

1. going along $\gamma$ from $x$ to $y$

1. going around the [[infinitesimal space|infinitesimal]] parallelogram spanned by $v$ and $w$;

1. coming back to $x$ along the reverse path $\gamma$.

Also: The [[higher parallel transport|higher]] holonomy of [[circle n-bundles with connection]] is given by [[fiber integration in ordinary differential cohomology]].
