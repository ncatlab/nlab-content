## Idea

A notion of [[entropy]]. 

In the context of [[probability theory]], the **max-entropy** or **Hartley entropy** of a discrete probability distribution is the [[logarithm]] of the number of outcomes with nonzero probability. The ordinary [entropy](entropy#entropy_of_a_partition_of_a_discrete_probability_space) of that distribution is never greater than the max-entropy.
