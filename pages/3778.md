**Mikio Sato** is a Japanese algebraic geometer and number theorist. He founded a subject called algebraic analysis, which he introduced along with the sheaf theoretic technique of [[hyperfunction]]s, fundamental aspects of microlocalization. Sato studied [[D-module]]s and especially [[holonomic D-module|holonomic systems]]. Much of his research is related to the study of singularities and related research in Hodge theory where he substantially extended the foundations. The similarities of that research to Dubrovin's noton of Frobenius manifolds  has been further developed by Klaus Hertling. He applied some of the methods to mathematical physics ([[integrable systems]], solitons and wave equations...).
