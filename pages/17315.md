##Idea 

Focusing is an idea originating in the [[proof theory]] of [[linear logic]].  Originally, it was introduced as a technique for making proof search in the [[sequent calculus]] tractable, by restricting the potential application of rules based on observations about the [[polarity in type theory|polarity]] of connectives ([Andreoli 1992](#Andreoli92)).  More abstractly, the _focalization_ property can be seen as a [[canonical form]] theorem for sequent calculus proofs, which holds in a wide range of systems beyond linear logic.

>Focusing, introduced by Jean-Marc Andreoli in the context of classical linear logic [Andreoli 1992], defines a normal form for sequent calculus derivations that cuts down on the number of possible derivations by eagerly applying invertible rules and grouping sequences of non-invertible rules. A focused sequent calculus is defined relative to some non-focused sequent calculus; focalization is the property that every non-focused derivation can be transformed into a focused derivation.
