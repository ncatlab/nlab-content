## Idea

The (expected) phenomenon in [[Yang-Mills theory]]/[[QCD]] that [[quark]]-excitations must form [[bound states]] which are neutral under the color charge -- such as the [[hadrons]] ([[protons]], [[neutrons]]) and [[mesons]].

## References

The idea is indicated in

* Wikipedia, _[Color confinement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_confinement)_

A formulation of confinement as an open problem of mathematical physics, together with many references, is in 

* [[Arthur Jaffe]], [[Edward Witten]], _Quantum Yang-Mills theory_ ([pdf](http://www.claymath.org/millennium/Yang-Mills_Theory/yangmills.pdf))

The relation to [[QCD instantons]]/[[monopoles]] in the [[QCD vacuum]] is discussed in section III D of
