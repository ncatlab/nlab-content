## Definition


In a [[category]] **associativity** is the condition that the two ways to use binary [[composition]] of [[morphisms]] to compose a sequence of three morphisms are _equal_ 

$$
  h \circ (g \circ f) = (h \circ g) \circ f
  \,.
$$

If the category has a single [[object]] it is a [[monoid]] and this condition is the _associtivity_ condition on the binary operation of monoids such as [[group]]s, [[ring]]s, [[algebra]]s, etc.

More generally, in [[higher category theory]], _associativity_ of composition of morphisms in an [[n-category]] means that the different ways to use binary composition for composing collections of [[k-morphisms]] form a [[contractible]] [[infinity-groupoid]]. This is a [[coherence law]].


For instance the associativity law in an [[A-infinity algebra]] is the special case of associativity in a 1-object [[A-infinity-category]].

## Examples

* See [[associahedron]].

* In a [[monoidal category]] associativity is the statement that the [[associator]] satisfies its [[coherence law]], which is true by a [[coherence theorem]].
