## Definition

The **torus** is the [[manifold]] obtained as the [[quotient]] 

$$
  T := \mathbb{R}^2 / \mathbb{Z}^2
$$ 

of the [[Cartesian space|Cartesian plane]], regarded as an [[abelian group]], by the subgroup of pairs of [[integers]].

More generally, for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ any [[natural number]], the $n$-torus is

$$
  T := \mathbb{R}^n / \mathbb{Z}^n
  \,.
$$ 

For $n = 1$ this is the [[circle]].

In this fashion each torus canonically carries the structure of an [[abelian group]], in fact of an abelian [[Lie group]]

## Properties


* The [[character group]] of a torus $T^n$ is isomorphic to its [[fundamental group]], which is $\mathbb{Z}^n$. See also at _[[Pontryagin duality]]_ and at _[[moduli space of flat connections]]_.
