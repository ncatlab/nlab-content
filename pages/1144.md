#Idea#

Rational homotopy theory studies special [[topological space]]s called **rational spaces**. The point of this is that

* every (simply connected) topological space can be _approximated_ by a rational space;

* rational topological spaces are entirely encoded in terms of [[differential graded algebra]].

This way rational homotopy theory connects and unifies two large areas of mathematics, [[homotopy theory]] and [[differential graded algebra]]. Akin to the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]], the [[Sullivan construction]] in rational homotopy theory connects the conceptually powerful perspective of [[homotopy theory]] with the computationally powerful perspective of [[differential graded algebra]]. 

Moreover, via the [[homotopy hypothesis]] the study of [[topological space]]s is connected to that of [[infinity-groupoid]]s, so that rational homotopy theory induces a bridge between [[infinity-groupoid]]s and [[differential graded algebra]]. It was observed essentially by Ezra Getzler that this bridge is nothing but higher [[Lie theory]] of [[L-infinity-algebra]]s.
