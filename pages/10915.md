### Definition

The real constant $\pi$ is the minimal positive root of the real function $sin_\mathbb{R} : \mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$, which is the unique solution to the differential equation/[[initial value problem]]
$$ sin ' ' = - sin $$
$$ sin 0 = 0 $$
$$ sin' 0 = 1 .$$

Alternatively, $\pi$ may be defined as $\frac{1}{2} \tau $, where [[tau|τ]] is the [[period]] of the same function $sin$.

An alternative description of $sin$ is as the unique function $\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ continuous at $0$ and otherwise satisfying 
$$ 1 - x^2 \leq \frac{sin(x)}{x} \leq 1 $$
and 
$$ sin 3 x = 3 sin x - 4 sin^3 x $$
although this makes practical calculations rather difficult.

### Tangential Remarks

Either of the definitions of $sin$ above mentions a thing, and claims some properties for it, in order to indirectly describe some other thing (in this case, $\pi$).  To properly make sense of either definition, it is necessary to ensure that one description or the other actually does define some thing, that there is in fact exactly one such thing so defined, and that it has the needed properties for the definition of $\pi$ to make sense — particularly, that the roots of $sin$ are isolated, and that there is a positive root.  These might make a decent [[exercise]] in a first course in classical analysis.
