## Definition via real analysis 

The real constant $\pi$ is the minimal positive root of the real function $sin_\mathbb{R} : \mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$, which is the unique solution to the differential equation/[[initial value problem]]
$$ sin ' ' = - sin $$
$$ sin 0 = 0 $$
$$ sin' 0 = 1 .$$

Alternatively, $\pi$ may be defined as $\frac{1}{2} \tau $, where [[tau|τ]] is the [[period]] of the same function $sin$.

An alternative description of $sin$ is as the unique function $\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ continuous at $0$ and otherwise satisfying 
$$ 1 - x^2 \leq \frac{sin(x)}{x} \leq 1 $$
and 
$$ sin 3 x = 3 sin x - 4 sin^3 x $$
although this makes practical calculations rather difficult. 

### Tangential Remarks

Either of the definitions of $sin$ above mentions a thing, and claims some properties for it, in order to indirectly describe some other thing (in this case, $\pi$).  To properly make sense of either definition, it is necessary to ensure that one description or the other actually does define some thing, that there is in fact exactly one such thing so defined, and that it has the needed properties for the definition of $\pi$ to make sense — particularly, that the roots of $sin$ are isolated, and that there is a positive root.  These might make a decent [[exercise]] in a first course in classical analysis. 

## Definition via complex analysis 

A related but perhaps more conceptual description is via complex analysis. Recall that the standard [[exponential function]] is defined by the formula 

$$\exp(z) = \sum_{n \geq 0} \frac{z^n}{n!} = 1 + z + \frac{z^2}{2} + \frac{z^3}{6} + \ldots$$ 

for all [[complex numbers]] $z$ (as an absolutely [[Cauchy sequence|convergent series]]), and satisfies the equations 

* $\exp(z + w) = \exp(z) \cdot \exp(w)$, 

* $\exp(\widebar{z}) = \widebar{\exp(z)}$. 

It follows that for $z = i t$, where $z + \widebar{z} = 0$, we have ${|\exp(i t)|} = 1$. 

Thus $t \mapsto \exp(i t)$ defines a [[Lie group]] homomorphism $\phi$ from the additive group $\mathbb{R}$ to the multiplicative group $S^1$ of unit complex numbers. It may be checked that this is a local diffeomorphism: a local inverse to $z \mapsto \exp(z) - 1$ is given by 

$$z \mapsto \log (1 + z) = z - \frac{z^2}{2} + \frac{z^3}{3} - \ldots$$ 

Thus $\phi: \mathbb{R} \to S^1$ maps a small neighborhood $U$ of $0$ onto a small neighborhood $V$ of $1$ in $S^1$. As $S^1$ is [[connected space|connected]], we have $S^1 = \bigcup_{n \geq 1} V^n$ where $V^n$ consists of $n$-fold products of elements in $V$, and in fact a finite union $\bigcup_{n=1}^m V^n$ suffices since $S^1$ is [[compact space|compact]]. It follows easily that the homomorphism $\phi: \mathbb{R} \to S^1$ is surjective. 

In particular, there exists some element $t \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $\phi(t) = -1$. We may define $\pi$ to be the least positive $t$ such that $\phi(t) = -1$ (cf. Euler's formula $e^{\pi i} + 1 = 0$). Indeed, it is slightly nicer just to observe that $\ker(\phi)$ is nontrivial (since $S^1$ has [[torsion group|torsion elements]] whereas $\mathbb{R}$ does not) and must be a discrete subgroup, generated by a unique positive $\tau$, and we define $\pi = \tau/2$. 

These considerations suggest why mathematicians sometimes consider $\tau = 2\pi$ as "more fundamental" than $\pi$, or even that $2\pi i$ is the truly fundamental quantity, being (up to sign) the unique generator of the kernel of $\exp: \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}^\times$. This is also reflected in the familiar contour integral formula 

$$\int_{{|z|} = 1} \frac{d z}{z} = 2\pi i$$ 

that on some level pervades complex analysis. 

## "Archimedean" definition 

A sequence that approximates $\pi$ that was likely available to Archimedes (using his "method of exhaustion") involves calculating perimeters of inscribed $2^n$-gons (squares, octagons, etc.) in a unit circle, using half-angle formulas. This brief description is, for that matter, available to high-school students, so we can just summarize the result. 

Define a sequence by the recursion $x_1 = 0$, $x_{n+1} = \sqrt{2 + x_n}$. This sequence rapidly approaches $2$ in the limit; put 

$$y_n = 2^n \sqrt{2 - x_n}.$$ 

The statement is that $y_n$ is half the perimeter of the inscribed $2^{n+1}$-gon for $n \geq 1$, so that $y_n$ is an increasing convergent sequence which tends to $\pi$ in the limit. 

## Other formulas 

* Leibniz formula: $\frac{\pi}{4} = 1 - \frac1{3} + \frac1{5} - \ldots$. 

* Product formulas: Vieta, Euler, Wallis, ... 

* Euler series for $\pi^{2 n}$ ... 

* Continued fractions ... 

## Irrationality and transcendence 

Mention of Lambert and Legendre for irrationality; Hermite and Lindemann for transcendence.
