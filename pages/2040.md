## Idea

Quite generally, the term _Mackey functor_ refers to an [[additive functor]] from a ([[subcategory]] of) a [[category of correspondences]] (in a [[disjunctive category]] $\mathcal{C}$) to possibly any other [[additive category]] which however usually is the "base" abelian category. More generally the term now refers to the fairly obvious [[homotopy theory|homotopy theoretic]] or [[higher category theory|higher categorical]] refinements of this concept.

Therefore the concept of Mackey functors is similar to that of [[sheaves with transfer]] and as such appears (implicitly) in the discussion of [[motives]] (explicitly e.g. in [Kahn-Yamazaki 11, section 2](#KahnYamazaki11), where $\mathcal{C}$ is a category of suitable [[schemes]]).

The concept was however introduced and named as such in the context of [[representation theory]] ([Dress 71](#Dress71)) and [[equivariant homotopy theory]]/[[equivariant cohomology]] ([May 96](#May96)). In that context it first received its full [[(∞,1)-category]]-theoretic formulation and discussion ([Barwick 14](#Barwick14)).

## Definition

We follow the modern account in ([Barwick 14](#Barwick14)).

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[disjunctive (∞,1)-category]] and write $Corr_1(\mathcal{C})^\otimes$ for the [[(∞,1)-category of correspondences]] in $\mathcal{C}$, regarded as a [[symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category]] with respect to its [[coproduct]] (which is a [[biproduct]] by disjunctiveness of $\mathcal{C}$).

Write $\mathcal{A} = $[[Spectra]]${}^\otimes$ for the [[(∞,1)-category of spectra]] regarded as a [[symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category]] with respect to the [[smash product of spectra]].  More generally $\mathcal{A}$ could be any [[symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category|symmetric monoidal]] [[stable (∞,1)-category]]

Then a (spectral) _Mackey functor_ on $\mathcal{C}$ is a [[monoidal (∞,1)-functor]] of the form


$$
  S \;\colon\; Corr_1(\mathcal{C})^\otimes \longrightarrow \mathcal{A}^{\otimes}
  \,.
$$

Notice that this means that $S$ is in particular


1. a covariant [[(∞,1)-functor]] $(-)_\ast \colon\mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{A}$;

1. a contravariant [[(∞,1)-functor]], hence  $(-)^\ast \colon\mathcal{C}^{op} \to \mathcal{A}$;

1. satisfying the [[Beck-Chevalley condition]].

(More generally one may specify suitably chosen sub-$(\infty,1)$-categories $\mathcal{C}^\dagger, \mathcal{C}_\dagger \subset \mathcal{C}$ and restrict $Corr_1$ to [[correspondences]] whose left leg is in $\mathcal{C}_\dagger$ and whose right leg is in $\mathcal{C}^\dagger$ ([Barwick 14, section 5](#Barwick14)).)

## Examples

### Dress' Mackey functors

For $\mathcal{A}$ taken to be (the [[derived category]]) of an [[abelian category]] (or better: postcomposed with a [[homological functor]] ) this definition reduces ([Barwick 14](#Barwick14)) to that of Mackey functors as originally defined in ([Dress 71](#Dress71)).


### Equivariant spectra 
 {#EquivariantSpectra}

Let $G$ be a [[finite group]]. Let $\mathcal{C}= G Set$ be its category of [[permutation representations]]. Then $Corr_1(\mathcal{C})$ is essentially what is called the [[Burnside category]] of $G$ (possibly after abelianizing/stabilizing the hom-spaces suitably, but as ([Barwick 14](#Barwick14)) highlights, this is unnecessary when one is mapping out of this into something abelian/stable, as is the case here).

For $G$ finite then Mackey functors on $\mathcal{C}$ are equivalent to  genuine [[G-spectra]] ([Guillou-May 11, theorem 0.1](#GuillouMay11), [Barwick 14, below example B.6](#Barwick14)) (Notice that this equivalence does not in general hold if $G$ is not a finite group.)



(...)
 
For $E$ a [[genuine G-spectrum]] then the corresponding spectral Mackey functor is given by the [[equivariant homotopy groups]] of $E$

$$
  G/H \mapsto E(G/H) =  [\Sigma^\infty_+ G/H, E]_G
  \,,
$$

where on the right we have the $G$-equivariant [[mapping spectrum]] from the (equivariant) [[suspension spectrum]] of the [[orbit]] $G/H$ to $E$.

(e.g. ([Guillou-May 11, remark 2.5](#GuillouMay11)), see also ([Schwede 15, p. 16](#Schwede15)) for restriction and section 4 culminating on p. 37 for transfer and compatibility).

Further, the corresponding abelian-group valued Mackey functor is

$$
  \pi_n(E) \colon G/H \mapsto [G/H_+\wedge S^n, X]_G
  \,,
$$

where now on the right we have just the [[homotopy classes]] of maps (e.g. [Greenlees-May 95, p. 43](#GreenleesMay95))

## Cohomology with coefficients in a Mackey functor
 {#Cohomology}

We discuss [[cohomology]] of [[topological G-spaces]] with [[coefficients]]
in a Mackey functor, following notation and conventions as in ([May 96, sections IX, X](#May96)). See also ([Greenlees-May 95, p. 9](#GreenleesMay95)).


+-- {: .num_defn #CohomologyOfGSpace}
###### Defininition

For $X$ a [[pointed object|pointed]] [[G-CW complex]], define the [[chain complex]] $C_\bullet(X)$ of Mackey functors to be given by the stable [[equivariant homotopy groups]] of the quotient spaces $X^{\bullet}/X^{\bullet-1}$:

$$
  C_n(X) \coloneqq \pi_n(X^n/X^{n-1})
  \,,
$$

Then for $A$ any Mackey functor, the ordinary cohomology of $X$ with [[coefficients]] in $A$ is the [[cochain cohomology]] of the complex of homs of Mackey functors $C_n(X) \to A$:

$$
  H_G^n(X,A) \coloneqq H^n( Hom(C_\bullet(X), A) )
  \,.
$$

More generally, for $V$ a G-[[representation]], the $(n-V)$-[[RO(G)-grading|RO(G)-graded]] cohomology of $X$ with coefficients in $A$ is

$$
  H_G^{n-V}(X,A) = H_G^n(S^V \wedge X, X)
  \,.
$$

###### Remark

The corresponding [[reduced cohomology]] $\tilde H^n(-,A)$ is represented by maps into the [[Eilenberg-MacLane space|Eilenberg-MacLane G-space]]:

$$
  \tilde H^n(X,A) \simeq [X,K(A,n)]_G
  \,.
$$

###### Remark

For this kind of cohomology, there is equivariant [[Serre spectral sequence]] ([Kronholm 10](#Kronholm10)).
