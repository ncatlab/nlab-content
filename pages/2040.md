## Idea

Quite generally, the term _Mackey functor_ refers to an [[additive functor]] from a ([[subcategory]] of) a [[category of correspondences]] (in a [[disjunctive category]] $\mathcal{C}$) to possibly any other [[additive category]] which however usually is the "base" abelian category. More generally the term now refers to the fairly obvious [[homotopy theory|homotopy theoretic]] or [[higher category theory|higher categorical]] refinements of this concept.

Therefore the concept of Mackey functors is similar to that of [[sheaves with transfer]] and as such appears (implicitly) in the discussion of [[motives]] (explicitly e.g. in [Kahn-Yamazaki 11, section 2](#KahnYamazaki11), where $\mathcal{C}$ is a category of suitable [[schemes]]).

The concept was however introduced and named as such in the context of [[representation theory]] ([Dress 71](#Dress71)) and [[equivariant homotopy theory]]/[[equivariant cohomology]] ([May 96](#May96)). In that context it first received its full [[(∞,1)-category]]-theoretic formulation and discussion ([Barwick 14](#Barwick14)).

## Definition

We follow the modern account in ([Barwick 14](#Barwick14)).

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[disjunctive (∞,1)-category]] and write $Corr_1(\mathcal{C})^\otimes$ for the [[(∞,1)-category of correspondences]] in $\mathcal{C}$, regarded as a [[symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category]] with respect to its [[coproduct]] (which is a [[biproduct]] by disjunctiveness of $\mathcal{C}$).

Write $\mathcal{A} = $[[Spectra]]${}^\otimes$ for the [[(∞,1)-category of spectra]] regarded as a [[symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category]] with respect to the [[smash product of spectra]].  More generally $\mathcal{A}$ could be any [[symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category|symmetric monoidal]] [[stable (∞,1)-category]]

Then a (spectral) _Mackey functor_ on $\mathcal{C}$ is a [[monoidal (∞,1)-functor]] of the form


$$
  S \;\colon\; Corr_1(\mathcal{C})^\otimes \longrightarrow \mathcal{A}^{\otimes}
  \,.
$$

Notice that this means that $S$ is in particular


1. a covariant [[(∞,1)-functor]] $(-)_\ast \colon\mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{A}$;

1. a contravariant [[(∞,1)-functor]], hence  $(-)^\ast \colon\mathcal{C}^{op} \to \mathcal{A}$;

1. satisfying the [[Beck-Chevalley condition]].

(More generally one may specify suitably chosen sub-$(\infty,1)$-categories $\mathcal{C}^\dagger, \mathcal{C}_\dagger \subset \mathcal{C}$ and restrict $Corr_1$ to [[correspondences]] whose left leg is in $\mathcal{C}_\dagger$ and whose right leg is in $\mathcal{C}^\dagger$ ([Barwick 14, section 5](#Barwick14)).)

## Examples

### Dress' Mackey functors

For $\mathcal{A}$ taken to be (the [[derived category]]) of an [[abelian category]] (or better: postcomposed with a [[homological functor]] ) this definition reduces ([Barwick 14](#Barwick14)) to that of Mackey functors as originally defined in ([Dress 71](#Dress71)).


### Genuine equivariant spectra

For $G$ a [[finite group]] let $\mathcal{C}= G Set$ be its category of [[permutation representations]]. Then $Corr_1(\mathcal{C})$ is essentially what is called the [[Burnside category]] of $G$ (possibly after abelianizing/stabilizing the hom-spaces suitably, but as ([Barwick 14](#Barwick14)) highlights, this is unnecessary when one is mapping out of this into something abelian/stable, as is the case here).

Then Mackey functors on $\mathcal{C}$ are equivalently  genuine [[G-spectra]] ([Guillou-May 11, theorem 0.1](#GuillouMay11), [Barwick 14, below example B.6](#Barwick14)).


(...)
 
For $E$ a [[genuine G-spectrum]] then the corresponding Mackey functor is given by the assignment

$$
  G/H \mapsto E(G/H) =  [\Sigma^\infty_+ G/H, E]_G
  \,,
$$

where on the right we have the $G$-equivariant [[mapping spectrum]] from the (equivariant) [[suspension spectrum]] of the orbit $G/H$ to $E$.

(e.g. [Guillou-May 11, remark 2.5](#GuillouMay11))
