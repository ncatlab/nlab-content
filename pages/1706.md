## Idea 

The **Cobordism Hypothesis** roughly states that the [[(∞,n)-category of cobordisms]] $Bord_n$ is the 
[[free functor|free]] [[symmetric monoidal (∞,n)-category]] [[(∞,n)-category with duals|with duals]] on a single object.

Since a fully [[extended topological quantum field theory]] may be identified with an [[(∞,n)-functor]] $Z : Bord_n \to C$, this implies that all these [[TQFT]]s are entirely determined by their value on the point: "the [[n-vector space]] of [[state]]s" of the theory.

## Formalization 

In ([Lurie](#Lurie)) a formalization and proof of the cobordism hypothesis is described.

### For framed cobordisms

+-- {: .un_def }
###### Definition

Let $C$ by a [[symmetric monoidal (∞,n)-category]] [[(∞,n)-category with duals|with duals]] and $Core(C)$ its [[core]] (the maximal [[∞-groupoid]] in $C$).

Let $Bord_n^{fr}$ be the [[symmetric monoidal (∞,n)-category|symmetric monoidal]] [[(∞,n)-category of cobordisms]].

Finally let $Fun^\otimes(Bord_n^{fr} , C )$ be the [[(∞,n)-category]] of symmetric monoidal [[(∞,n)-functor]]s from bordisms to $C$.

###### Theorem (cobordism hypothesis, framed version)

Evaluation of any such functor $F$ on the [[point]] ${*}$

$$
  F \mapsto F({*})
$$

induces an [[(∞,n)-functor]]

$$
  pt^* : Fun^\otimes(Bord_n^{fr} , C ) \to C .
$$


such that

* this factors through the [[core]] of $C$;

* the map 

  $$
    pt^* : Fun^\otimes(Bord_n^{fr} , C ) \to Core(C)
  $$

  is an [[equivalence in an (∞,1)-category|equivalence]] of [[(∞,n)-categories]].

=--

This is ([Lurie, theorem 2.4.6](#Lurie)).


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The proof is based on

1. the Galatius-Madsen-Tillmann-Weiss theorem (thm 2.7.4, page 50) which characterizes the geometric realization $|Bord_n^{or}|$ in terms of the suspension of the Thom spectrum;

1. Igusas connectivity result which he uses to show that putting “framed Morse functions” on cobrdisms doesn’t change their homotopy type (theorem 3.4.7, page 73)

In fact, the Galatius-Madsen-Weiss theorem is now supposed to be a corollary of Lurie's result.

### For cobordisms in a topological space twisted by a vector bundle

+-- {: .un_def }
###### Definition

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]] and $\xi \to X$ a [[real number|real]] [[vector bundle]] on $X$ of [[rank]] $n$. Let $N$ be a [[smooth manifold]] of [[dimension]] $m \leq n$. An **$(X,\xi)$-structure** on $N$ consists of the following data

* A [[continuous function]] $f : N \to X$;

* An [[isomorphism]] of [[vector bundle]]s

  $$
    T N \oplus \mathbb{R}^{n-m} \simeq f^* \xi
  $$

  between the [[fiber]]wise [[direct sum]] of the [[tangent bundle]] $T N$ with the trivial rank $(n-m)$ budle and the [[pullback]] of $\xi$ along $f$. 

=--

This is ([Lurie, notation 2.4.16](#Lurie)).

+-- {: .un_def }
###### Definition

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]] and $\xi \to X$ an $n$-[[dimensional]] [[vector bundle]]. The [[(∞,n)-category]] $Bord_n^(X, \xi)$ is defined analogously to $Bord_n$ but woth all manifolds equipped with $(X,\xi)$-structure.

=--

This is ([Lurie, def. 2.4.17](#Lurie)).

+-- {: .un_theorem #CobHypTheoremForTargetSpaceAndVectorBundle}
###### Theorem

Let $C$ be a [[symmetric monoidal (∞,n)-category]] with duals, let $X$ be a [[CW-complex]], let $\xi \to X$ be an $n$-[[dimensional]] [[vector bundle]] over $X$ equipped with an inner product, and let $\tilde X \to X$ be the [[associated bundle|associated]] [[orthogonal group|O(n)]]-[[principal bundle]] of orthonormal [[frame]]s in $\xi$. 

There is an [[equivalence in an (∞,1)-category|equivalence]] in [[∞Grpd]]

$$
  Fun^\otimes(Bord_n^{(X,\xi)}, C)
  \simeq
  Top_{O(n)}(\tilde X, \tilde C)
  \,,
$$ 

where on the right we regard $C^{\tilde}$ as a [[topological space]] carrying the canonical $O(n)$-[[action]] discussed [above](spring).

=--

This is ([Lurie, theorem. 2.4.18](#Lurie)).


### For framed cobordisms in a topological space 
  {#StatementForCobordismsInAManifold}

Let now $\xi = \mathbb{R}^n \otimes X$ be the trivial vector bundle, such thatz $\tilde X = O(n) \times X$.  Write

$$
  Bord_n^{fr}(X) := Bord_n^{(X,X \times \mathbb{R}^n)}
  \,.
$$

Write $\Pi(X) \in $ [[∞Grpd]] for the [[fundamental ∞-groupoid]] of $X$.

+-- {: .un_prop }
###### Corollary

There is an [[equivalence in an (∞,1)-category|equivalence]] in [[∞Grpd]]

$$
  Fun^\otimes(Bord^{fr}_n(X), C)
  \simeq
  (\infty,n)Cat(\Pi(X), \tilde C)
  \simeq
   \infty Grpd(\Pi(X), Core(\tilde C))
  \,,
$$ 

=--

This is a special case of the [above theorem](#CobHypTheoremForTargetSpaceAndVectorBundle).

Notice that one can read this as saying that $Cob_n(X)$ is roughly like the [[free functor|free]] [[symmetric monoidal (∞,n)-category]] on the [[fundamental ∞-groupoid]] of $X$ (relative to $\infty$-categories of fully dualizable objects at least).



## Remarks ##

### Morphisms of TQFTs

In particular this means that $Fun^\otimes(Bord_n^{fr} , C )$ is itself an $(\infinity,0)$-category, i.e. an [[∞-groupoid]].

When interpreting symmetric monoidal functors from bordisms to $C$ as [[TQFT]]s this means that TQFTs with given codomain $C$ form a [[topological space|space]], an [[∞-groupoid]]. In particular, any two of them are either equivalent or have no morphism between them.

According to [[Chris Schommer-Pries]] interesting morphisms of [[TQFT]]s arise when looking at transformations only on sub-categories on all of $Bord_n$. This is described at [[QFT with defects]] .


### Invariants determined from the point ###

The theorem does say that the invariant attached by an extended TQFT to the point determines all the higher invariants – however it is important to notice that there are strong constraints on what is assigned to the point. For an $n$-dimensional _framed_ theory one needs to assign a [[fully dualizable object]], and the meaning of the term "fully dualizable" depends on $n$, and gets increasingly hard to satisfy as n grows..

For an $n$-dimensional unoriented theory, the object assigned to the point has to be a fixed point for the $O(n)$- action on fully dualizable objects that is obtained from the framed case of the theorem. 

In the 1d case, this $O(1)$ action on dualizable objects takes every object to its dual, and an $O(1)$ fixed point is indeed a vector space with a nondegenerate symmetric inner product. 

For an _oriented_ theory $n$-dimensional theory need an $SO(n)$-fixed point, which for $n=1$ is nothing but for $n=2$ ends up meaning a [[Calabi-Yau category]] (in the case the target 2-category is that of categories).

In fact something more general is true: if one wants a theory that takes values on manifolds equipped with a $G$-structure, for $G$ any group mapping to $O(n)$ (such as for instance [[orientation]] already discussed or its higher versions [[Spin structure]] or [[String structure]] or [[Fivebrane structure]] or ...) one needs to assign to the point a $G$-fixed point in dualizable objects in your category (with $G$ acting through $O(n)$). 

This beautifully includes all the above plus for example [[manifold]]s with maps (up to [[homotopy]]) to some auxiliary (connected) space $X$ – here we take $G$ to be the [[loop space]] $\Omega X$  of $X$ (mapping trivially to $O(n)$), so that a reduction of the structure group of the manifold to $G$ involves a map to the [[delooping]] $\mathcal{B}G \simeq X$. 

Such theories are classified by $X$-families of fully dualizable objects. 

Notice that there is an important subtlety of Lurie's theorem in the case of manifolds with $G$-structure which is easy to confuse. The general version of the theorem about TFTs does not say that they are the $G$-fixed points for the $G$-action on fully dualizable objects, but rather they are the _homotopy_ fixed points. This is very important because a homotopy fixed point is not just a property. It is additional structure. Depending on $G$, this additional structure is often encoded in the higher dimensional portion of the field theory.

 One can see this in the 1 dimensional case: there is no property of vector spaces which automatically endows them with an inner product, but it is [[stuff, structure, property|extra structure]].
