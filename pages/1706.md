The material that should go here is, for some reason, mostly at [[generalized tangle hypothesis]]. You should go there to learn more. Better yet, you go there and then come back here to create a decent entry on the cobordisms hypothesis.

###### [[cobordism hypothesis|Cobordism Hypothesis]]

The $n$-category $n Cob$ of cobordisms is the free stable $n$-category with duals on one object (the point).

In [[FQFT|extended toplogical quantum field theory]], which is really the representation theory of these cobordism $n$-categories, we expect:

###### Extended TQFT Hypothesis

An $n$-dimensional unitary extended TQFT is a weak $n$-[[n-functor|functor]], preserving all levels of duality, from the $n$-category $n Cob$ of cobordisms to $n Hilb$, the $n$-category of $n$-[[n-Hilbert space|Hilbert spaces]].

Putting the extended TQFT hypothesis and the cobordism hypothesis together, we obtain:

###### The primacy of the point

An $n$-dimensional unitary extended TQFT is completely described by the $n$-Hilbert space it assigns to a point.
