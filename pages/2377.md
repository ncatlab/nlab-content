This looks nice, and I think that it probably matches pretty closely the way that I usually think when reading ordinary mathematics.  I haven\'t read it very carefully yet, so take this with a grain of salt, but I think that it would be even more user-friendly to use sets, elements, and *subsets* (rather than binary relations) as the basic concepts.  Presumably you have to throw in ordered pairs too, but I think that this matches 'ordinary' language *very* closely.  ---Toby

_Mike_: Yes, you're right, and I did think of something like that.  However, I haven't managed to find a good way to "throw in ordered pairs."  I'd like an axiom like "for any sets $A$ and $B$, there exists a set $A\times B$ such that ..." but what comes after "such that?"  With only sets, elements, and subsets as the other data, there's no way to relate the elements of $A\times B$ to the elements of $A$ and $B$.

I guess one possible approach would be to make the construction of products an *operation*, rather than an existential axiom.  Then for every pair of sets $A$ and $B$ there would be a *specified* set $A\times B$, and for every pair of elements $x\in A$ and $y\in B$ there would be a *specified* element $(x,y)\in A\times B$, with an axiom asserting that every element of $A\times B$ is of the form $(x,y)$ for a unique $x$ and $y$.  I suppose we do tend to think more in terms like that, but it's less aesthetically pleasing to me because it's not really "structural" to specify a particular $A\times B$.  So now I'm undecided.

_Toby_:  I don\'t see what\'s unstructural about that!  Although I think that we\'ve had this conversation before ....

[[David Roberts]]: This looks awesome - but we haven't seen any cons yet. I thought about this on the train this morning and have a few questions:

 * Is there a set of relations (resp. functions) between two sets?
 * In theorem 10 below, we need this to talk about a bijective correspondence between functions $B\to P A$ and relations $B\looparrowright A$.
 * Can we talk about Grothendieck universes or analogous size-related mechanisms? (this is a naive question, since there may be (no need for/obvious way to do) this in a structural set theory that I am unaware of.

In reply to Toby's point about replacing relations by subsets as fundamental, it makes sense to me that we probe the interior of a set by how it relates to other sets, and that we find out about the elements of a set by how it relates to the one-point set. But the aim seems to be useability by everyday mathematicians. That being said, this material seems easier to learn as a first approach to foundations (for undergraduates/early postgrads) than ZF or NBG, requiring less cruft to get to proving theorems.

# Introduction #

**SEAR**, short for **Sets, Elements, And Relations**, is a [[structural set theory]] with the following properties:

* It is equivalent in strength to the [[material set theory]] [[ZF]].  (It can be augmented by an [[axiom of choice]] to produce *SEAR-C*, which is strongly equivalent to [[ZFC]].)
* It contains a subtheory called **bounded SEAR** which (when augmented by choice) is strongly equivalent to [[ETCS]].  Conversely, ETCS can be augmented by a replacement axiom to become equivalent to SEAR-C.

Being a structural set theory, SEAR differs from ZF in the following ways (which are also ways in which it is similar to ETCS):

* There is a type distinction between *sets* and *elements*; a set is never an element of another set.  Every element is an element *of some set*.
* The elements of a set have no "internal structure;" they are merely featureless points.
* The "elementhood" relation $x\in A$ only makes sense when $x$ is known to be an element of some ambient set $X$ and $A$ is known to be a subset of $X$.

A good description of the difference between material and structural set theory can be found at [[Trimble on ETCS I]].  However, ZFC and ETCS also differ along another axis than the material-structural.  At [[Trimble on ETCS III]] the following metaphor is proposed for this dimension:

> with ZFC it's more as if you can just hop in the car and go; with ETCS you build the car engine from smaller parts with your bare hands, but in the process you become an expert mechanic, and are not so rigidly attached to a particular make and model.

Using this metaphor, SEAR can be thought of as an ETCS-car which comes preassembled with a nice slick control panel.  Or, using an alternate metaphor, ZFC is like Windows, ETCS is like UNIX, and SEAR is like OS X (or maybe Ubuntu).  With SEAR you get a nice familiar interface with which it is easy to do standard things, there is less cruft than you get with ZFC, and behind the scenes you have all the power of ETCS (and more).  (Of course, if you like Microsoft products, then this metaphor probably does not appeal to you.)

Note that experts will probably always prefer to build their own car; the goal of SEAR is to make structural set theory accessible to a wider audience.  In particular, SEAR is intended to demonstrate the complete independence of [[structural set theory]] from [[category theory]].  Thus, apart from being (by default) stronger than ETCS, SEAR differs from it in the following ways:

* It includes the notion of an *element* of a set as a primitive concept, rather than defining it as a particular sort of function.
* It does *not* include the notion of a [[function]] as a primitive concept (instead it includes the notion of a [[binary relation]], with functions defined via their [[graph of a function|graphs]] in a familiar way).
* It does not include the notions of composition or identities (of either functions or relations) as primitive concepts.  In particular, it does not require the user to know what a [[category]] is, even implicitly.
* As a corollary, its axioms do not require knowledge of categorical concepts such as [[limits]] and [[natural numbers objects]] (although these concepts can be very naturally introduced while learning SEAR).
* The property of [[axiom of separation|separation]] (one of the most important facts in the everyday use of set theory) is a direct consequence of the axioms of SEAR.  Compare how in ETCS, the property of bounded separation follows from the theorem that a [[topos]] is a [[Heyting category]], which requires [[Trimble on ETCS II|substantial work]].


# Description of SEAR #

## Types ##

SEAR is a theory about three types of things: **sets**, **elements**, and **relations**.  Every element, and every variable that ranges over elements, is always associated to something denoting a set (which might be a constant or a variable); we say it is an element **of** that set.  If $x$ is an element of $A$ we write $x\in A$; note that this is not an *assertion* which may be true or false, but a *typing* declaration.  In formal terms, this means that SEAR is a [[dependent type theory]].  One consequence of this is that whenever we quantify over elements we must always quantify over elements *of some set*; thus we can say "for all elements $x\in A$" but not "for all elements $x$."  Another consequence is that the assertion $x=y$ is only well-formed (a precondition to its being true _or_ false) if $x$ and $y$ are elements of the same set.

In a similar manner, every relation is always associated to an ordered pair of sets, the first called its **[[source]]** and the second its **[[target]]** (thus the fundamental relations in SEAR are binary relations).  If $\varphi$ is a relation from $A$ to $B$ we write $\varphi:A\looparrowright B$.  As with elements, the assertion $\varphi=\psi$ is only well-formed if $\varphi$ and $\psi$ have the same source and the same target.

Implicit in the existence of three types of things is that nothing is both a set and an element, etc., so in particular a statement such as $x=A$ is not well-formed if $x$ is an element and $A$ a set.  Furthermore, SEAR does not include an equality relation between sets: even if $A$ and $B$ are both sets we do not consider $A=B$ to be well-formed.  (Thus SEAR adheres to the philosophy of "speak no [[evil]].")

The final piece of data that we have is a notion of when a relation $\varphi:A\looparrowright B$ **holds** of a pair of elements $x\in A$ and $y\in B$.  We write $\varphi(x,y)$ when $\varphi$ holds of $x$ and $y$.


## Basic axioms ##

Now we can state the axioms of SEAR, beginning with the most basic ones.

**Axiom 0 (Nontriviality):** _There exists a set which contains an element._

**Axiom 1 (Relational comprehension):** _For any two sets $A$ and $B$, and any property $P$ that can obtain of an element of $A$ and an element of $B$, there exists a unique relation $\varphi:A\looparrowright B$ such that $\varphi(x,y)$ if and only if $P$ obtains of $x$ and $y$._

Axiom 1 basically says that relations are what we expect them to be intuitively.  It should remind the reader of the [[axiom of separation]] (and, like separation, it is actually an axiom *schema* when "property" is interpreted formally as "first-order formula").  The two important differences are (1) the presence of two sets and two variables, rather than one, and (2) the fact that what is produced is not a *set*, but a *relation* (a different kind of thing). The to-be-introduced Axiom 2 will enable us to make relations into (sub)sets, but first we need some terminology.

+-- {: .num_defn #function}
###### Definition
A relation $\varphi:A\looparrowright B$ is called a **[[function]]** from $A$ to $B$ if for any $x\in A$, there exists exactly one $y\in B$ with $\varphi(x,y)$.
=--

We write $f:A\to B$ for such a function, and for $x\in A$ we write $f(x)$ for the resulting unique $y\in B$.  Note that the uniqueness clause in Axiom 1 implies that functions are extensional: if $f,g:A\to B$ and $f(x)=g(x)$ for all $x\in A$, then $f=g$.

**Axiom 2 (Tabulations):** _For any relation $\varphi:A\looparrowright B$, there exists a set $|\varphi|$ and functions $p:{|\varphi|}\to A$ and $q:{|\varphi|}\to B$ such that: (1) for any $x\in A$ and $y\in B$, we have $\varphi(x,y)$ if and only if there exists $r\in {|\varphi|}$ with $p(r)=x$ and $q(r)=y$, and (2) for any $r\in {|\varphi|}$ and $s\in{|\varphi|}$, if $p(r)=p(s)$ and $q(r)=q(s)$, then $r=s$._

A set $|\varphi|$ equipped with $p$ and $q$ as in Axiom 2 is called a **tabulation** of the relation $\varphi$.  We think of $|\varphi|$ as "the set of pairs $(x,y)$ such that $\varphi(x,y)$ holds," with $p$ and $q$ projecting $(x,y)$ to $x$ and $y$, respectively.  Note that by Axiom 1, any set $R$ equipped with functions $p:R\to A$ and $q:R\to B$ satisfying (2) determines a unique relation $\varphi:A\looparrowright B$ such that $\varphi(x,y)$ holds iff there is an $r\in R$ with $p(r)=x$ and $q(r)=y$; then $R$ is a tabulation of $\varphi$.


## Consequences of the basic axioms ##

Axioms 0, 1, and 2 alone are very powerful!  Here are some things we can do with them.

+-- {: .num_theorem #emptyset}
###### Theorem
There exists a set $\emptyset$ which has no elements.
=--
+--{: .proof}
###### Proof
By Axiom 0, there exists a set $A$.  By Axiom 1, there exists a relation $\varphi:A\looparrowright A$ such that $\varphi(x,y)$ holds *never*.  Using Axiom 2, let $\emptyset$ be a tabulation of $\varphi$.
=--

From now on we fix a particular set $\emptyset$ having no elements.  By Axiom 1, for any set $A$ there is exactly one relation $\emptyset\looparrowright A$ and exactly one relation $A\looparrowright\emptyset$.

+-- {: .num_theorem #terminalset}
###### Theorem
There exists a set $1$ which has exactly one element.
=--
+--{: .proof}
###### Proof
By Axiom 0, there exists a set $A$ containing an element $x$.  By Axiom 1, there exists a relation $\varphi:A\looparrowright A$ such that $\varphi(y,z)$ holds iff $y=x$ and $z=x$.  Using Axiom 2, let $1$ be a tabulation of $\varphi$.
=--

From now on we fix a particular set $1$ having exactly one element;
we usually denote this element by $\star$.  By Axiom 1, for every set $A$ there exists a unique function $f:A\to 1$, defined by $f(x)=\star$ for every $x\in A$.  Likewise, to every function $g:1\to A$ there corresponds a unique element $x\in A$, by $g(\star)=x$.

We define a **subset** of a set $A$ to be a relation $S:1\looparrowright A$.  By Axiom 1, a subset $S$ of $A$ is determined by precisely those $x\in A$ such that $S(\star,x)$.  If $S(\star,x)$ we write $x\in S$.  Note that this is an *overloading* of the notation $\in$; it can be distinguished from the previous usage because here $S$ is a relation, not a set.  Note also that the previous usage $x\in A$ was a typing declaration (it says what kind of thing $x$ is when we introduce it), whereas $x\in S$ is a statement which can be either true or false.

Now Axiom 2 implies that from any subset $S$ of $A$ we can construct a set $|S|$ with a function $i:{|S|}\to A$ such that (1) $x\in S$ iff there is an $x'\in {|S|}$ with $i(x')=x$, and (2) for $x',x''\in {|S|}$, if $i(x')=i(x'')$ then $x'=x''$.  A function $i$ with property (2) is called **injective**; in this way we set up a correspondence between subsets and injective functions.  (Likewise, a function $f:A\to B$ is **surjective** if for any $y\in B$ there is an $x\in A$ with $f(x)=y$.)  Combined with Axiom 1, this implies the following *separation property*.

+-- {: .num_theorem #sep}
###### Theorem
For any property $P$ of elements of a set $A$, there exists a set $B$ and an injective function $i:B\to A$ such that for $a\in A$, we have $P(a)$ iff $a=i(b)$ for some $b\in B$.
=--

Although the set $|S|$ is not determined uniquely by the subset $S$, it is determined up to [[bijection]].  We define an **bijection** to be a relation $\psi:A\looparrowright B$ such that for every $x\in A$ there is a unique $y\in B$ with $\psi(x,y)$, and for every $y\in B$ there is a unique $x\in A$ with $\psi(x,y)$.  Clearly any bijection is a function, as is its opposite (defined by $\psi^o(y,x) \Leftrightarrow \psi(x,y)$), and these two properties characterize bijections.  It is also easy to see that a function is a bijection iff it is both injective and surjective.

+-- {: .num_theorem #tabuniq}
###### Theorem
If $|\varphi|$ and ${|\varphi|}'$ are two tabulations of the same relation $\varphi:A\looparrowright B$, then there is a bijection between $|\varphi|$ and ${|\varphi|}'$.
=--
+--{: .proof}
###### Proof
By Axiom 1, define $B:{|\varphi|} \looparrowright {|\varphi|}'$ such that $B(x,y)$ holds precisely when $p(x)=p'(y)$ and $q(x)=q'(y)$.  The properties of tabulations immediately imply that $B$ is a bijection.
=--

In particular, $|S|$ is determined up to bijection by $S$, and $\emptyset$ and $1$ are determined up to bijection.

The **composite** of two relations $\varphi:A\looparrowright B$ and $\psi:B\looparrowright C$ is defined to be the relation $\psi\varphi:A\looparrowright C$ (also written $\psi\circ\varphi$) such that $\psi\varphi(x,z)$ holds of $x\in A$ and $z\in C$ iff there is a $y\in B$ with $\varphi(x,y)$ and $\psi(y,z)$.  The **identity** relation $id_A:A\looparrowright A$ is defined by $id_A(x,y) \Leftrightarrow x=y$.

+-- {: .num_theorem #category}
###### Theorem
Composition of relations is associative ($\chi(\psi\varphi)=(\chi\psi)\varphi$), and identity relations are identities for composition ($\id_B\circ \varphi = \varphi = \varphi\circ\id_A$).  The composite of functions is a function, and the identity relation is a function.  The composite of bijections is a bijection, and a relation $\varphi:A\looparrowright B$ is a bijection iff there is a relation $\psi:B\looparrowright A$ such that $\psi\varphi = id_A$ and $\varphi\psi=id_B$.
=--
+--{: .proof}
###### Proof
Just as in naive set theory.
=--

It follows that we have two [[categories]] whose objects are the sets: in [[Rel]] the morphisms are the relations, while in [[Set]] the morphisms are the functions.  In both categories, the [[isomorphisms]] are the bijections.  We have also already observed that $\emptyset$ and $1$ are an [[initial object]] and a [[terminal object]] in $Set$, respectively, and that $\emptyset$ is both initial and terminal in $Rel$.

For sets $A$ and $B$, let $\top:A\looparrowright B$ denote the relation such that $\top(x,y)$ holds always.  A tabulation of $\top$ is denoted $A\times B$; it is a set equipped with functions $p:A\times B \to A$ and $q:A\times B\to B$ such that for any $x\in A$ and $y\in B$, there exists a unique $z\in A\times B$ with $p(z)=x$ and $q(z)=y$.  It is called the **cartesian product** of $A$ and $B$.

+-- {: .num_theorem #product}
###### Theorem
For any sets $A$ and $B$, $A\times B$ is a [[product]] of $A$ and $B$ in the category $Set$, and a [[coproduct]] in the category $Rel$.
=--
+--{: .proof}
###### Proof
Just as in naive set theory.
=--

In particular, $Set$ has products.

+-- {: .num_theorem #lex}
###### Theorem
The category $Set$ has finite limits.
=--
+--{: .proof}
###### Proof
It remains to construct the [[equalizer]] of two functions $f,g:A\to B$.  Let $S$ be the subset of $A$ so that $x\in S$ just when $f(x)=g(x)$; then ${|S|}\to A$ is easily shown to be an equalizer of $f$ and $g$.
=--

+-- {: .num_theorem #imfact}
###### Theorem
For any function $f:A\to B$ we have $f = m e$, where $m:im(f)\hookrightarrow B$ is an injection and $e:A\twoheadrightarrow im(f)$ is a surjection.  A set $im(f)$ equipped with such $m$ and $e$ is unique up to bijection and is called the **image** of $f$.
=--
+--{: .proof}
###### Proof
Let $im(f)$ be $|S|$ where $S$ is defined by $y\in S$ iff there exists an $x\in A$ with $f(x)=y$.  By definition, we have an injection $m:im(f)\hookrightarrow B$.  And for any $x\in A$, clearly $f(x)\in S$, so there is a unique $y\in im(f)$ with $m(y)=f(x)$; we define $e(x)=y$.  It is easy to verify the rest.
=--

Similarly, we can define the union and intersection of subsets of $A$ in the usual way: we have $x\in S\cup T$ iff $x\in S$ or $x\in T$, and $x\in S\cap T$ iff $x\in S$ and $x\in T$.

+-- {: .num_theorem #heyting}
###### Theorem
$Set$ is a [[well-pointed category|well-pointed]] [[Heyting category]] and $Rel$ is a [[division allegory]].
=--
+--{: .proof}
###### Proof
Left to the reader.
=--


## Power sets and colimits ##

In structural set theory, sets cannot contain other sets (or relations), so we cannot strictly speaking have "the set of subsets of a set $A$."  What we generally do instead is have a set $P A$ each of whose elements is *associated to* a subset of $A$ in a bijective way.  This association happens via a specified relation between $A$ and $P A$.

**Axiom 3 (power sets):** _For any set $A$, there exists a set $P A$ and a relation $\epsilon:A\looparrowright P A$ such that for any subset $S$ of $A$, there exists a unique $s\in P A$ with the property that for any $x\in A$, we have $x\in S$ iff $\epsilon(x,s)$._

As in both material set theory and ETCS, many useful consequences flow from this axiom.

+-- {: .num_theorem #topos}
###### Theorem
For any sets $A$ and $B$, there is a bijective correspondence between functions $B\to P A$ and relations $B\looparrowright A$.  It follows that $Set$ is a [[topos]] (and $Rel$ is a power allegory).
=--
+--{: .proof}
###### Proof
Given $f:B\to P A$, we define $R_f:B\looparrowright A$ such that $R_f(y,x)$ holds iff $\epsilon(x,f(y))$ holds.  And given $R:B\looparrowright A$, we define $f_R(y)$ to be the unique element of $P A$ such that $\epsilon(x,f_R(y))$ holds iff $R(y,x)$ holds.  It is easy to verify that these are inverse correspondences.
=--

An **[[equivalence relation]]** on a set $A$ is, of course, a relation $R:A\looparrowright A$ which is reflexive, transitive, and symmetric.

+-- {: .num_theorem #quotients}
###### Theorem
If $R$ is an equivalence relation on $A$, then there is a surjective function $q:A\twoheadrightarrow B$ such that $R(x,y)$ holds iff $q(x)=q(y)$.
=--
+--{: .proof}
###### Proof
$R$ induces a function $f_R:A\to P A$ as above; let $B$ be $im(f_R)$ and $q$ the surjective part of the image factorization.  If $R(x,y)$ holds, then by symmetry and transitivity, $R(x,z)\Leftrightarrow R(y,z)$ for all $z$; hence $f_R(x)=f_R(y)$ and so $q(x)=q(y)$.  Conversely, if $q(x)=q(y)$, then $f_R(x)=f_R(y)$; but $y\in f_R(y)$ by reflexivity, hence $y\in f_R(x)$ and thus $R(x,y)$ holds.
=--

Such a $B$, which is easily seen to be unique up to bijection, is called a **quotient** of $R$ and often written $A/R$.

Likewise, given sets $A$ and $B$, let $A\sqcup B={|S|}$, where $S$ is the subset of $P A \times P B$ consisting of the pairs $(\{x\},\{\})$ for $x\in A$ and $(\{\},\{y\})$ for $y\in B$.  (Of course, here we are identifying elements of $P A \times P B$ with ordered pairs of subsets of $A$ and $B$ via the projections of the product and the defining relations $\epsilon_A$ and $\epsilon_B$.)  We have evident injections $A\to A\sqcup B$ and $B\to A\sqcup B$ which are jointly surjective and have disjoint image; we call $A\sqcup B$ the **disjoint union** of $A$ and $B$.

In particular, it follows that $Set$ is a [[pretopos]] (as is any topos).


## Infinity ##

**Axiom 4 (Infinity):** _There exists a set $N$, containing an element $o$, and a function $s:N\to N$ such that $s(n)\neq o$ for any $n\in N$._

It is easy to deduce any of the usual consequences of the axiom of infinity.  The set $N$ is not asserted to be minimal, but it is easy to cut it down to be so using separation.  In particular, this axiom implies that $Set$ has a [[natural numbers object]].  We can then proceed to construct the set $\mathbb{Q}$ of rational numbers and the set $\mathbb{R}$ of real numbers in any of the usual ways.

Note also that Axiom 4 implies Axiom 0.


## Collection ##

The final axiom of SEAR is somewhat trickier to motivate.  Suppose for the sake of argument that there existed a *universal set*, meaning a set containing all other sets.  Now in structural set theory this is meaningless, since no set can contain other sets, but there is an easy fix: we consider instead *indexed families* of sets.  There are multiple ways to make this precise, but here is a very simple one: an $A$-indexed family of sets is simply a relation $M:A\looparrowright X$.  The set indexed by each element $a\in A$ is $M_a = \{x\in X | M(a,x)\}$.  (Often one requires the $M_a$ to be disjoint in $X$, so that $M^o$ is a function $X\to A$, but this is unnecessary.)

With this definition, a *universal family of sets* would be a set $U$ with a $U$-indexed family of sets $E:U\looparrowright Y$ such that for any set $A$, there exists a unique $u\in U$ and a bijection $A\cong E_u$.  The existence of such a universal set is inconsistent, but the collection axiom can be thought of as the "ghost" of what *would be implied* by Axioms 1 and 2 if a universal set *did* exist.  Let's now unravel that.

If $U$ were a universal set, then any $A$-indexed family $M:A\looparrowright X$ would induce a unique function $f:A\to U$ such that $E_{f(x)} \cong M_x$ for all $x\in A$.  Conversely, any function $f:A\to U$ would induce an $A$-indexed family of sets with this property: just take the composite relation $E \circ f$.  (This family would not be unique, but it would be unique up to a suitable notion of [[equivalence]] between indexed families.)  Thus it is reasonable to consider the "ghost" of a function $f:A\to U$ to be simply an $A$-indexed family of sets.

The ghost of a relation $A\looparrowright U$ is even easier.  By Axiom 1, to give such a relation would be equivalent to describing a property $P$ that can obtain of an element of $A$ and a set.  Thus, the ghost of a relation $A\looparrowright U$ is simply such a property.

If $U$ existed, Axiom 2 would imply that any relation $A\looparrowright U$ had a tabulation consisting of a set $B$ and functions $p:B\to A$ and $q:B\to U$.  We now kill $U$ and inspect the ghostly remnants of this tabulation.

**Axiom 5 (Collection):** _For any set $A$ and any property $P$ which can obtain of an element of $A$ and a set, there exists a set $B$, function $p:B\to A$, and a $B$-indexed family of sets $M:B\looparrowright Y$ such that (1) $P(p(b),M_b)$ holds for any $b\in B$, and (2) for any $a\in A$, if there exists a set $X$ with $P(a,X)$, then $a\in im(p)$._

What this axiom asserts is actually a bit weaker than the precise ghost of a tabulation of $P$; that would require instead of (2) that for any $a\in A$ and any set $X$ with $P(a,X)$, there exists a $b\in B$ with $p(b)=a$ and $M_b\cong X$.  However, this stronger statement is still inconsistent, because if we took $A=1$ and $P=\top$ it would resurrect $U$ in the form of $B$!  The form given above is weak enough to keep the dead in their graves, yet strong enough to be useful (though we will not go into its uses here).

_Exercise: why is adherence to "speak no evil" necessary for Axiom 5 to be reasonable as stated?_


# Variants and Comparisons #

## The Axiom of Choice ##

We obtain a theory called **SEAR-C** (SEAR with Choice) by adding the following axiom:

**Axiom 6 (Choice):** _If $\varphi:A\looparrowright B$ is a relation such that for any $a\in A$, there exists a $b\in B$ with $\varphi(a,b)$, then there exists a function $f:A\to B$ with $\varphi(a,f(a))$ for all $a\in A$._

This is easily seen to be equivalent to asserting that all surjections are [[split epimorphism|split]] in $Set$, which is a more common categorical form of the [[axiom of choice]].

## Constructive SEAR ##

Axioms 1-5 of SEAR make perfect sense whether the ambient logic is [[classical logic|classical]] or [[constructive mathematics|constructive]].  By Diaconescu's argument, Choice implies the logic is classical.

To obtain a [[predicative mathematics|predicative]] theory, Axiom 3 can be replaced by an appropriate weaker axiom, such as the existence of  disjoint unions, quotient sets, and/or [[function sets]], or a structural version of the axiom of "subset collection."

## Bounded SEAR and ETCS ##

By **bounded SEAR** we mean the subtheory consisting of axioms 2-4 of SEAR plus

**Axiom 1B (Bounded relational comprehension):** _The same as Axiom 1, but the property $P$ must be bounded (it can only involve quantifiers over elements, not sets or relations)._

All the theorems cited above remain true with Axiom 1 replaced by Axiom 1B, so bounded SEAR still implies that $Set$ is a well-pointed topos with a NNO.  Therefore, *bounded SEAR-C* implies [[ETCS]].  Conversely, it is not hard to show that given any [[well-pointed topos]], if we interpret "set" as "object of the topos", "element of $A$" as "[[global element]] $1\to A$", and "relation $A\looparrowright B$" as "[[subobject]] of $A\times B$," then Axioms 0, 1B, 2, and 3 are satisfied.  It follows that ETCS also implies bounded SEAR-C, so the two are equivalent.

ETCS can also be augmented with additional axioms to make it equivalent to full SEAR-C, but that is beyond our scope at the moment.

## SEAR and ZF ##

It is easy to show that the sets, elements, and relations in any model of [[ZF]] (resp. [[ZFC]]) satisfy the axioms of SEAR (resp. SEAR-C). The least obvious axiom is Collection, whose proof requires the [[axiom of replacement]] in ZF.  (In fact, the axiom of replacement of ZF is equivalent, modulo its other axioms, to an "axiom of collection" which is more akin to the SEAR axiom of collection.)

Conversely, from any model of SEAR one can *construct* a model of ZF, by taking the sets in ZF to be the "internal well-founded extensional relations."  This process is described at [[pure set]].  Thus, SEAR and SEAR-C are at least equiconsistent with ZF and ZFC, respectively. In fact, SEAR-C and ZFC are equivalent, in the sense that passage back and forth in either direction yields an equivalent model.  However, passage from SEAR to ZF and back again can lose information, if there are sets in the model of SEAR which do not admit any well-founded extensional relation (this doesn't happen in the presence of choice, since then every set can be well-ordered).

## Type theory and internalization

Every topos has an [[internal logic]], which is a [[type theory]].  However, the line between type theory and structural set theory is fine and sometimes hard to see; the main difference is that structural set theory can involve quantifiers over sets (= types), while type theory only allows ("bounded") quantifiers over elements of types.  Through this correspondence, *Intuitionistic Bounded SEAR* can be treated as a type theory and interpreted internally in any topos with a NNO.  Of course, if the topos is [[boolean topos|boolean]], then the logic can be classical.

One can also write down stronger axioms on a topos such that if they are satisfied, then full Intuitionistic SEAR can be interpeted "internally" in that topos, extending the usual internal logic.
