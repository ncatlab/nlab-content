## Idea

In a context $\mathbf{H}$ of [[differential cohesion]] with $\Im$ the [[infinitesimal shape modality]], then for any object $X\in \mathbf{H}$ the [[base change]] [[comonad]] 

$$
  Jet_X \coloneqq i^\ast i_\ast
$$

for base change along the $X$-component of the [[unit of a monad|unit]] of $\Im$ 

$$
  \mathbf{H}_{/X}
  \stackrel{\overset{i^\ast}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{i_\ast}{\longrightarrow}}
  \mathbf{H}_{/\Im(X)}
  \,,
$$

may be interpreted as sending any [[bundle]] over $X$ to its [[jet bundle]]. 

## Properties

The [[Eilenberg-Moore category]] of [[coalgebras]] over the Jet comonad has the interpretation of the category of [[partial differential equations]] with [[variables]]  in $X$. The [[co-Kleisli category]] of the Jet comonad has the interpretation as being the category of bundles over $X$ with [[differential operators]] between them as morphisms ([Marvan 86](#Marvan86), [Marvan 89](#Marvan89)).
