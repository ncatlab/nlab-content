## Idea

In [[topology]], some of the [[separation axioms]] that may be considered on [[topological spaces]] may equivalently be refomrulated in temrs of [[lifting properties]] ([Gavrilovich 14](#MG)). 


## Background and notation


A [[topological space]] comes with a _[[specialisation preorder]]_ on its points: for
points $x,y \in X$,  $x \leq y$ iff $y \in cl x$ ($y$ is in the [[topological closure]] of $x$), or equivalently. The resulting [[preordered set]] may be regarded as a [[category]] whose
[[objects]] are the points of ${X}$ and where there is a unique [[morphism]] $x{\searrow}y$ iff $y \in cl x$.

For a [[finite topological space]] $X$, the specialisation preorder or equivalently the corresponding category uniquely determines the space: a [[subset]] of ${X}$ is [[closed subset|closed]] iff it is
[[downward closed subset|downward closed]], or equivalently, there are no morphisms going outside the subset.


The monotone maps (i.e. [[functors]]) are the [[continuous maps]] for this topology.

We denote a finite topological space by a list of the arrows (morphisms) in
the corresponding category; '$\leftrightarrow $' denotes an [[isomorphism]] and '$=$' denotes the [[identity morphism]].  An arrow between two such lists denotes a [[continuous map]] (a functor) which sends each point to the correspondingly labelled point, but possibly turning some morphisms into identity morphisms, thus gluing some points. 

With this notation, we may display continuous functions for instance between the [[discrete space]] on two points, the [[Sierpinski space]], the [[antidiscrete space]] and the [[point space]] as follows (where each point is understood to be mapped to the point of the same name in the next space):

$$
  \array{
  \{a,b\}
     &\longrightarrow& 
  \{a{\searrow}b\}
     &\longrightarrow& 
  \{a\leftrightarrow b\}
    &\longrightarrow& 
  \{a=b\}
  \\
  \text{(discrete space)}
     &\longrightarrow& 
  \text{(Sierpinski space)}
    &\longrightarrow& 
  \text{(antidiscrete space)}
    &\longrightarrow& 
  \text{(single point)}
  }
$$

In $A \longrightarrow  B$, each object and each morphism in $A$ necessarily appears in {B} as well; we avoid listing 
the same object or morphism twice. Thus 
both 
$$
\{a\} \longrightarrow  \{a,b\}
  \phantom{AAA} \text{ and } \phantom{AAA} 
\{a\} \longrightarrow  \{b\}
$$ 
denote the same map from a single point to the discrete space with two points.
Both
 $$\{a{\swarrow}U{\searrow}x{\swarrow}V{\searrow}b\}\longrightarrow \{a{\swarrow}U=x=V{\searrow}b\}\text{ and }\{a{\swarrow}U{\searrow}x{\swarrow}V{\searrow}b\}\longrightarrow \{U=x=V\}$$
denote the morphism gluing points $U,x,V$.

In $\{a{\searrow}b\}$, the point $a$ is open and point ${b}$ is closed.



## Separation conditions in terms of arrows

Fix two sets ([[subsets]]) $F$ and $G$ of $S$.

*  The sets $F$ and $G$ are __[[disjoint sets|disjoint]]__ if their [[intersection]] is [[empty set|empty]]:

   $$ F \cap G = \empty .$$

   In terms of arrows,  the following map is well-defined: 
   $S_{F,G}: S \longrightarrow  \{F,G,x\}$ such that 
   $S_{F,G}(x)=F$ for $x \in F$, $S_{F,G}(x)=G$ for $x \in G$, and $S_{F,G}(x)=x$ for $x \notin F\cup G$.

*  They are __topologically disjoint__ if there exists a [[neighbourhood]] of one set that is disjoint from the other set:
   $$ (\exists\; U \stackrel{\circ}\supseteq F,\; U \cap G = \empty) \;\vee\; (\exists\; V \stackrel{\circ}\supseteq G,\; F \cap V = \empty) .$$
   In terms of arrows,   $S_{F,G}: S \longrightarrow  \{F\leftrightarrow G \leftrightarrow x \}$ factors as 


## Separation axioms as lifting properties 

In all of the following definitions, ${X}$ is  a topological space.


*  $ {X}$  is T0, or Kolmogorov, if any two distinct points in ${X}$ are topologically
distinguishable. (It will be a common theme among the separation axioms to have
one version of an axiom that requires T0 and one version that doesn't.)
As a formula, this is expressed as
   $$ \{x\leftrightarrow y\} \longrightarrow  \{x=y\} \,\rightthreetimes\,  {X} \longrightarrow  \{*\}$$

*    ${X}$ is R0, or symmetric, if any two topologically distinguishable points in $X$
are separated, i.e.
   $$ \{x{\searrow}y\} \longrightarrow  \{x\leftrightarrow y\} \,\rightthreetimes\,  {X} \longrightarrow  \{*\} $$

*  $X$ is T1, or accessible or Frechet, if any two distinct points in $X$ are
separated, i.e.
$$     \{x{\searrow}y\} \longrightarrow  \{x=y\} \,\rightthreetimes\,  {X} \longrightarrow  \{*\}  $$
 Thus, $X$ is T1 if and only if it is both T0 and R0. (Although you may
say such things as "T1 space", "Frechet topology", and "Suppose that the
topological space $X$ is Frechet", avoid saying "Frechet space" in this
context, since there is another entirely different notion of Frechet space in
functional analysis.)

*  $X$ is R1, or preregular, if any two topologically distinguishable points in
X are separated by neighbourhoods. Every R1 space is also R0.

*  $X$ is weak Hausdorff, if the image of every continuous map from a compact
Hausdorff space into $X$ is closed. All weak Hausdorff spaces are T1, and all
Hausdorff spaces are weak Hausdorff.

*  $X$ is Hausdorff, or T2 or separated, if any two distinct points in $X$ are
separated by neighbourhoods, i.e.
$$    \{x,y\} \hookrightarrow  {X} \,\rightthreetimes\,  \{x{\searrow}X{\swarrow}y\} \longrightarrow  \{x=X=y\} $$
Thus, $X$ is Hausdorff if and only if it is both T0
and R1. Every Hausdorff space is also T1.

*  $X$ is $T2\frac{1}{2}$, or Urysohn, if any two distinct points in $X$ are separated by
closed neighbourhoods, i.e.
$$
 \{x,y\} \hookrightarrow  {X} \,\rightthreetimes\,  \{x{\searrow}x'{\swarrow}X{\searrow}y'{\swarrow}y\} \longrightarrow  \{x=x'=X=y'=y\}
$$
Every $T2\frac{1}{2}$ space is also Hausdorff.

*  $X$ is completely Hausdorff, or completely T2, if any two distinct points in
X are separated by a continuous function, i.e. 
$$ \{x,y\} \hookrightarrow  {X} \,\rightthreetimes\,   [0,1]\longrightarrow \{*\}
$$
 where  $\{x,y\} \hookrightarrow  X$  runs through all injective maps from the discrete two
point space $\{x,y\}$.

Every completely Hausdorff space is
also $ T2\frac{1}{2} $.

*  $X$ is regular if, given any point {x} and closed subset $F$ in $X$ such that {x} does
not belong to $F$, they are separated by neighbourhoods, i.e.
$$    \{x\} \longrightarrow  {X} \,\rightthreetimes\,  \{x{\searrow}X{\swarrow}U{\searrow}F\} \longrightarrow  \{x=X=U{\searrow}F\}
$$
(In fact, in a regular
space, any such {x} and{F} will also be separated by closed neighbourhoods.) Every
regular space is also R1.

*  $X$ is regular Hausdorff, or T3, if it is both T0 and regular.[1] Every
regular Hausdorff space is also $T2\frac{1}{2}$.

*  $X$ is completely regular if, given any point ${x}$ and closed set $F$ in $X$ such
that ${x}$ does not belong to $F$, they are separated by a continuous function, i.e. 
$$
 \{x\} \longrightarrow  {X} \,\rightthreetimes\,  [0,1] \cup \{F\} \longrightarrow  \{x{\searrow}F\}
$$ 
where points $F$ and $1$ are topologically indistinguishable, $[0,1]$ goes to $x$, and $F$ goes to $F$.

Every
completely regular space is also regular.

*  $X$ is Tychonoff, or T3$\frac{1}{2}$, completely T3, or completely regular Hausdorff, if
it is both T0 and completely regular.[2] Every Tychonoff space is both regular
Hausdorff and completely Hausdorff.

*  $X$ is normal if any two disjoint closed subsets of $X$ are separated by
neighbourhoods, i.e.
$$   \emptyset \longrightarrow {X} \,\rightthreetimes\,  \{x{\swarrow}x'{\searrow}X{\swarrow}y'{\searrow}y\} \longrightarrow  \{x{\swarrow}x'=X=y'{\searrow}y\}
$$
 In fact, by Urysohn lemma a space is normal if and only if any two disjoint
closed sets can be separated by a continuous function, i.e.
 $$   \emptyset \longrightarrow  {X} \,\rightthreetimes\,  \{0'\} \cup [0,1] \cup \{1'\} \longrightarrow  \{0=0'{\searrow}x{\swarrow}1=1'\} $$
where points
$0',0$ and $1,1'$ are topologically indistinguishable,
            $[0,1]$ goes to $x$, and both $0,0'$ map to point $0=0'$,  and both $1,1'$ map to point
$1=1'$.



*  $X$ is normal Hausdorff, or T4, if it is both T1 and normal. Every normal
Hausdorff space is both Tychonoff and normal regular.

*  $X$ is completely normal if any two separated sets $A$ and $B$ are separated by
neighbourhoods $U\supset A$ and $V\supset B$
      such that $U$ and $V$ do not intersect, i.e.
 $$\emptyset \longrightarrow  {X} \,\rightthreetimes\,  \{X{\swarrow}A\leftrightarrow U{\searrow}U'{\swarrow}W{\searrow}V'{\swarrow}V\leftrightarrow B{\searrow}X\} \longrightarrow  \{U=U',V'=V\}$$
      Every completely normal space is also normal.


*  $X$ is perfectly normal if any two disjoint closed sets are precisely
separated by a continuous function, i.e. 
$$
 \emptyset\longrightarrow {X} \,\rightthreetimes\,  [0,1]\longrightarrow \{0{\swarrow}X{\searrow}1\}
$$   
where $(0,1)$ goes to the open point $X$, and $0$ goes to $0$, and $1$ goes to $1$.

Every perfectly normal space is also
completely normal.



## Merge or discard




### $T_4$/Normality

The [[Tietze extension theorem]] applies to [[normal spaces]].

Accordingly, a (Hausdorff) space $X$ is normal if and only if every function $f \colon A \to \mathbb{R}$ from a [[closed subspace]] $A \subset X$ admits an [[extension]] $\tilde{f}: X \to \mathbb{R}$, 

$$
  \array{
    A &\overset{f}{\longrightarrow}& \mathbb{R}
    \\
    \downarrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\tilde f}}
    \\
    X
  }
$$


or what is the same, every [[regular monomorphism]] into $X$ in $Haus$ has the [[left lifting property]] with respect to the map $\mathbb{R} \to 1$.
