There is nothing inherently wrong,Michael Kors, in artistic terms, in presenting Mapplethorpe or any other controversial artist in a depoliticised, formalist framework. The question is: are museum directors and curators intentionally choosing such a framework over a more political one or, more chillingly, is it their only option? Mapplethorpe himself preferred the mysteries of form to the push-and-pull of politics, and thats fine. But curators have a responsibility to history as well as art, and the best exhibitions recognise that one never makes complete sense without the other.
