Even though Kyunki, Kahani and Kasauti ended after being on air for several years, newer dramas with more prescient themes have taken their place to satisfy an audience hungry for TV drama. Professor Munshi explains: "They are still set within the big joint families where several generations live together, but Balika Vadhu (The Child Bride), which deals with child marriages and Naa Aanaa Is Des Laado (Don't Come to This Country, Darling), which is about female foeticide, deal with socially relevant issues." A popular drama now is Ek Nayi Pehchaan (A New Identity) which actually turns the mum-in-law-daughter-in-law relationship on its head.
