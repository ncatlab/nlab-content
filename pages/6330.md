## Idea

[[dynamics|Dynamics]] in [[physics]] affects both [[observables]] and, dually, [[states]]; this is most well known in [[quantum physics]] but applies equally well to [[classical physics]]. The different "pictures" of physics differ in how the dynamics is explicitly formalized:

* In the [[Schrödinger picture]], states are propagated through [[time]], while observables are held fixed; the axiomatic formalization of this is given by [[cobordism category]] [[representation]]s in [[FQFT]].

* In the [[Heisenberg picture]], the dependence of observables on time (or more generally [[spacetime]]) is encoded, while the state is held fixed; the axiomatic formalization of this is given by the [[Haag–Kastler axioms]] of [[AQFT]].

* The __Dirac (interaction) picture__ is a mixture of these two approaches: dynamics is split into a free (or otherwise solvable) part and an [[perturbation theory|interaction or perturbation]]; one of these is take to affect the states, the other the observables.

The pictures are named after those physicists who first used or popularised these approaches to quantum physics.
