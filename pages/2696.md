## Classical case

The classical **Whitehead theorem** asserts that

###### Theorem (Whitehead)

Every [[weak homotopy equivalence]] between [[CW-complexes]] is a [[homotopy equivalence]].

(See also the discussion at [[m-cofibrant space]]).

Using the [[homotopy hypothesis]]-theorem this may be reformulated:

###### Corollary

In the [[(∞,1)-category]] [[∞ Grpd]] every [[weak homotopy equivalence]] is a [[homotopy equivalence]].

## Equivariant version

In $G$-[[equivariant homotopy theory]] the statement is that $G$-homotopy equivalences between [[G-CW complexes]] are equivalent to maps that are weak homotopy equivalences on [[fixed point]] spaces for all closed subgroups (e.g. [Greenlees-May 95, theorem 2.4](#GreenleesMay95)). See at _[[equivariant Whitehead theorem]]_.

## In general $(\infty,1)$-toposes 

There is a notion of [[homotopy groups]] for objects in every [[∞-stack]] [[(∞,1)-topos]], as described at [[homotopy group (of an ∞-stack)]]. Accordingly, there is a notion of [[weak homotopy equivalence]] in every [[∞-stack]] [[(∞,1)-topos]] and hence an analog of the statement of Whiteheads theorem. One finds that

**Warning** Whitehead's theorem **fails** for general [[(∞,1)-toposes]] and non-[[truncated object in an (infinity,1)-category|truncated]] objects.

The [[∞-stack]] [[(∞,1)-topos]]es in which the Whitehead theorem does hold are the [[hypercomplete (∞,1)-topos]]es. These are precisely the ones that are [[presentable (∞,1)-category|presented]] by a local [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]]. 

For instance the hypercomplete $(\infty,1)$-topos [[Top]] is presented by the model structure on simplicial presheaves on the point, namely the [[model structure on simplicial sets]].


## In homotopy type theory

Since [[homotopy type theory]] admits models in [[(∞,1)-toposes]] (and in particular in non-hypercomplete ones), Whitehead's theorem is not provable when regarded as a statement about types in homotopy type theory.  From this perspective, the truth of Whitehead's theorem is a [[foundational axiom]] that may be regarded as a "classicality" property, akin to [[excluded middle]] or the [[axiom of choice]] --- we call it **Whitehead's principle** (not to be confused with [[Whitehead's problem]], another statement that is independent of the usual axioms of set theory).

Whitehead's principle does hold, however, for maps between [[homotopy n-types]] for any finite $n$; this is provable in homotopy type theory by [[induction]] on $n$.
