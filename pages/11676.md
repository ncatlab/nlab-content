## Idea

Hodge cohomology is a variant of [[de Rham cohomology]] for [[complex varieties]] induced by a canonical [[Hodge filtration]] on [[differential forms]].

## References

The definition of absolute Hodge cohomology originates around

* [[Alexander Beilinson]], _Notes on absolute Hodge cohomology_, Applications of algebraic K-theory to algebraic geometry and number theory, Part I, II (Boulder, Colo., 1983), Contemp. Math., vol. 55, Amer. Math. Soc., Providence, RI, 1986, pp. 35-68. MR 862628 (87m:14019)
