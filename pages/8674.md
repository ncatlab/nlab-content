## Statement

Let $G$ be a [[finite group]] with [[order of a group|order]] ${\vert G\vert} \in \mathbb{N}$.

###### Theorem
**(Cauchy)**

If a [[prime number]] $p$ divides ${\vert G\vert}$, then equivalently

* $G$ has an element of [[order of an element|order]] $p$;

* $G$ has a [[subgroup]] of [[order of a group|order]] $p$.

=--

This result is not completely trivial. One route to this would go as follows: knowing that Sylow $p$-subgroups $H$ of $G$ exist (see [[class equation]] for a proof), any nontrivial element $h$ of $H$ would be of order $p^r$ for some $r \gt 0$, and then $h^{p^{r-1}}$ would be the desired element. Come to think of it, it's actually an immediate consequence of the theorem [here](/nlab/show/class+equation#ppower). But see [McKay](#McKay) for a snappier proof.

###### Remark 
Cauchy had claimed a proof of his eponymous theorem in 1845, but in fact his proof had a gap. See [Meo](#Meo) for a historical discussion.
