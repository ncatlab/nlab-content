## Definition

An _equation_ is a [[proposition]] of [[equality]].

For 

$$
  x : X \vdash \phi(x) : Z
$$ 

and 

$$
  y : Y \vdash \psi(y) : Z
$$

two [[terms]] of some [[type]] $Z$ [[dependent type|dependent]] on [[variables]] $x$ of type $X$ and $y$ of type $Y$, respectively, the equation asserting that these two formulas are [[equality|equal]] is as a [[proposition]] the [[bracket type]] 

$$
 x : X, y : Y \vdash [\phi(x) = \psi(y)] : Type
$$

and as a not-neccessarily [[(-1)-truncated object|(-1)-truncated]] type just the [[identity type]]

$$
 x : X, y : Y \vdash (\phi(x) = \psi(y)) : Type
$$

itself.

The **space of solutions** of this equation is the [[dependent sum]] over all pairs of terms for which [[equality]] holds

$$
  \vdash \sum_{{x : X} \atop {y : Y}} (\phi(x) = \psi(y)) : Type
  \,.
$$

Hence a particular **solution** $sol$ is a [[term]] of this type

$$
  \vdash sol : \sum_{{x : X} \atop {y : Y}} (\phi(x) = \psi(y))
  \,,
$$

which means that it is a triple consisting of an $x \in X$, a $y \in Y$ and a witness $eq : (\phi(x) = \psi(y))$ that these indeed solve the equation.

In [[categorical semantics]] this means that the space of solutions to an equation between expression $\phi(x) : Z$ and $\psi(y) : Z$ of [[type]] $Z$ depending on [[variables]] of type $X$ and $Y$, respectively is the  [[pullback]]

$$
  \array{
    \sum_{{x : X} \atop {y : Y}} (\phi(x) = \psi(y))
    &\to& X
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\psi}}
    \\
    X &\stackrel{\phi}{\to}& Z
  }
  \,,
$$

the [[fiber product]] of $\phi$ with $\psi$. In the context of [[homotopy type theory]] this is the [[homotopy pullback]]/[[homotopy fiber product]].
