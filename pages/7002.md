## Definition

For $\Gamma : \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{B}$ a [[functor]] we say that it _has [[discrete objects]]_ if it has a  [[full and faithful functor|full and faithful]] [[left adjoint]] $Disc : \mathcal{B} \hookrightarrow \mathcal{E}$. 

An object in the [[essential image]] of $Disc$ is called a **discrete object.

This is for instance the case for the [[global section]] [[geometric morphism]] of a [[connected topos]] $ (Disc \dashv \Gamma ) : \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{B}$. 

In this situation, we say that a **co-concrete object** $X \in \mathcal{E}$ is one for which the $(Disc\dashv \Gamma)$-[[unit of an adjunction]] is an [[epimorphism]].

The dual concept is the of a _[[concrete object]]_.
