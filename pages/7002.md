## Definition

For $\Gamma : \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{B}$ a [[functor]] we say that it _has [[discrete object]]s_ if it has a  [[full and faithful functor|full and faithful]] [[left adjoint]] $Disc : \mathcal{B} \hookrightarrow \mathcal{E}$. 

An object in the [[essential image]] of $Disc$ is called a **discrete object.

This is for instance the case for the [[global section]] [[geometric morphism]] of a [[connected topos]] $ (Disc \dashv \Gamma ) : \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{B}$. 

If one thinks of $\mathcal{E}$ as a [[category]] of [[spaces]], then the discrete objects are called [[discrete spaces]].

The dual notion is that of _[[codiscrete objects]]_.
