Rust is an efficient programming language with compile time memory safety model based on the innovative notion of ownership and borrows, small runtime, modern concurency, zero cost abstractions, both object oriented and functional programming model. It's speed is about the speed of comparable C programs. Rust does not require garbage collector, hence it is useful for real time programming as garbage collectors periodically stall the system for order of 100 ms. It compiles both to native code (LLVM compilers are commonly used) and to [[WebAssembly]]. It is particularly useful for real time programming, systems programming, embedded systems, web programming (via WebAssembly), concurrent systems and safety critical applications including [[blockchain]] and [[smart contract]]s. It easily links to the languages in C/C++ (ABI) linking model.
