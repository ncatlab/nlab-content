## Idea

A [[vector bundle]] over a [[Riemann surface]] is called _stable_ (resp. _semistable_) if the ratio of its degree and its [[rank]] is bigger (resp. bigger or equal) than this ratio for any of its subbundles. 

This means that it is a [[stable point]] under the action of [[automorphisms]].

## References


Many references are at [[moduli space of bundles]]. The notion was introduced by [[David Mumford]] in the context of GIT in 1960-s:
