Diffeological spaces were originally described by J.M. Souriau in 1980.  They have subsequently been developed by [Patrick Iglesias-Zemmour](http://www.umpa.ens-lyon.fr/~iglesias/) who is writing a book on the subject.

###### Definition
Let $Diff$ denote the [[site]] whose objects are open subsets of Euclidean spaces and whose morphisms are $C^\infty$-maps.

A _diffeological space_ is a pair $(X,\mathcal{D})$ where $X$ is a set and $\mathcal{D}$ is a [[sheaf]] on $Diff$ that is a subsheaf of the sheaf $U \mapsto X^{|U|}$.

A morphism of diffeological spaces is a map of the underlying sets which defines a natural transformation on the sheafs.

A diffeological space is an example of a [[concrete sheaf]] on a [[concrete site]] and as such is covered by Baez and Hoffnung in 0807.1704.
