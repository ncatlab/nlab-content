## Idea

A **diffeological spaces** is a type of [[generalized smooth space]].  As with the other variants, it subsumes the notion of [[smooth manifold]] but also naturally captures other spaces that one would like to think of as smooth spaces but aren't manifolds; for example, the space of all smooth maps between two smooth manifolds can be made into a diffeological space. (These mapping spaces are rarely manifolds themselves, see [[manifolds of mapping spaces]].)

In a little more detail, a **diffeology**, $\mathcal{D}$ on a set $X$ is a [[presheaf]] on the category of open subsets of Euclidean spaces with smooth maps as morphisms.  To each open set $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$, it assigns a subset of $\Set(U,X)$.  The functions in $\Set(U,X)$ are to be regarded as the "smooth functions" from $U$ to $X$.  A **diffeological space** is then a set together with a diffeology on it.

Diffeological spaces were originally introduced in ([Souriau 79](#Souriau79)). They have subsequently been developed in the textbook ([Iglesias-Zemmour 13](#PIZ))

## Definition

+-- {: mynumdef #DiffSp}
###### Definition
Let $\mathcal{Op}$ denote the [[site]] whose objects are the open subsets of the Euclidean spaces $\mathbb{R}^n$  and whose morphisms are [[smooth map]]s between these.

A **diffeological space** is a pair $(X,\mathcal{D})$ where 

* $X$ is a set 

* and $\mathcal{D} \in Sh(\mathcal{Op})$ is a **[[diffeology]]** on $X$:

  * a [[subobject|subsheaf]] of the sheaf $U \mapsto Hom_{Set}(U,X)$ with $\mathcal{D}(*) = X$

  * equivalently: a [[concrete sheaf]] on the [[site]] $\mathcal{Op}$ such that $\mathcal{D}(*) = X$ - a [[concrete object|concrete]] [[smooth space]] (see there for more details).

A [[morphism]] of diffeological spaces is a morphism of the corresponding [[sheaves]]: we take $DiffeologicalSp \hookrightarrow Sh(CartSp)$ to be the full [[subcategory]] on the diffeological spaces in the sheaf topos.

=--

For $(X,\mathcal{D})$ a diffeological space, and for any $U \in \mathcal{Op}$, the set $\mathcal{D}(U)$ is also called the set of **plots** in $X$ on $U$. This is to be thought of as the set of ways of mapping $U$ smoothly into the would-be space $X$. This assignment _defined_ what it means for a map $U \to X$ of sets to be smooth. 

For some comments on the reasoning behind this kind of definition of generalized [[space]]s see [[motivation for sheaves, cohomology and higher stacks]].

A sheaf on the site $\mathcal{Op}$ of open subsets of Euclidean spaces is completely specified by its restriction to [[CartSp]], the full subcategory of Euclidean spaces.  Therefore in the sequel we shall often restrict our attention to [[CartSp]].

One may define a "very general smooth space" to be _any_ sheaf of [[CartSp]] and identify the [[sheaf topos]] $Sh(CartSp)$ as the category of very general smooth spaces.

A diffeological space precisely a [[concrete sheaf]] on the [[concrete site]] [[CartSp]]. The [[full subcategory]]

$$
  DiffeologicalSpace \hookrightarrow Sh(CartSp)
$$

on all concrete sheaves is not a [[topos]], but is a [[quasitopos]].


The concreteness condition on the sheaf is a reiteration of the fact that a diffeological space is a subsheaf of the sheaf $U \mapsto X^{|U|}$.  In this way, one does not have to explicitly mention the underlying set $X$ as it is determined by the sheaf on the one-point open subset of $\mathbb{R}^0$.


## Examples

* Every [[smooth manifold]] $X$, i.e. every object of [[Diff]], becomes a diffeological space by defining the plots on $U \in CartSp$ to be the ordinary [[smooth function]]s from $U$ to $X$, i.e. the morphisms in [[Diff]]:

  $$  
    X : U \mapsto Hom_{Diff}(U,X)
    \,.
  $$

* For $X$ and $Y$ two diffeological spaces, their [[product]] as sets $X \times Y$ becomes a diffeological space whose plots are pairs consisting of a plot into $X$ and one into $Y$

  $$
    X \times Y : U \mapsto Hom_{DiffSp}(U,X) \times Hom_{DiffSp}(U,Y)
    \,.
  $$

* Given any two diffeological spaces $X$ and $Y$, the set of 
  morphisms $Hom_{DiffSp}(X,Y)$ becomes a smooth space by taking 
  the plots on some $U$ to be the smooth morphisms $X \times U \to Y$, 
  i.e. the smooth $U$-parameterized families of smooth maps from $X$ to $Y$:

  $$
    [X,Y] : U \mapsto Hom_{DiffSp}(X \times U, Y)
    \,.
  $$

  In this formula we regard $U \in CartSp \hookrightarrow Diff$ 
  as a diffeological space according to the above example. 
  In fact, we apply secretly here the [[Yoneda embedding]] 
  and use the general formula for the 
  cartesian [[closed monoidal structure on presheaves]].

## Properties

### Embedding of smooth manifolds into diffeological spaces
 {#EmbeddingOfSmoothManifoldsIntoDiffeoloticalSpaces}

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The obvious functor from the category [[Diff]] of [[smooth manifold]]s to the category of diffeological spaces is a [[full and faithful functor]]

$$
  Diff \to DiffeologicalSpace
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

This is a direct consequence of the fact that [[CartSp]]$_{smooth}$ is a [[dense sub-site]] of [[Diff]] and the [[Yoneda lemma]]. 

It may nevertheless be useful to spell out a pedestrian proof.

To see that the functor is faithful, notice that if $f,g : X \to Y$ are two [[smooth function]]s that differ at some point, then they must differ in some [[open neighbourhood]] of that point. This [[open ball]] is a plot, hence the corresponding diffeological spaces differ on that plot.

To see that the functor is full, we need to show that a map of sets $f : X \to Y$ that sends plots to plots is necessarily a [[smooth function]], hence that all its [[derivative]]s exist. This can be tested already on all smooth curves $\gamma : (0,1) \to X$ in $X$. By [[Boman's theorem]], a function that takes all smooth curves to smooth curves is necessarily a smooth function. But curves are in particular plots, so a function that takes all plots of $X$ to plots of $Y$ must be smooth.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

The proof shows that we could restrict attention to the full sub-site $CartSp_{dim \leq 1} \subset CartSp$ on the objects $\mathbb{R}^0$ and $\mathbb{R}^1$ and still have a full and faithful embedding

$$
  Diff \hookrightarrow Sh(CartSp_{dim \leq 1})
  \,.
$$

This fact plays a role in the definition of [[Frölicher space]]s, which are [[generalized smooth space]]s defined by plots by curves into and out of them.

While the site $CartSp_{dim \leq 1}$ is more convenient for some purposes, it is not so useful for other purposes, mostly when diffeological spaces are regarded from the point of view of the full sheaf topos: the sheaf topos $Sh(CartSp_{dim \leq 1})$ lacks some non-[[concrete sheaf|concrete]] sheaves of interest, such as the sheaves of differential forms of degree $\geq 2$.

=--

### Embedding of Banach manifolds into diffeological spaces
 {#EmbeddingOfBanachManifoldsIntoDiffeologicalSpaces}


Also [[Banach manifolds]] embed [[full and faithful functor|fully faithfully]] into the category of diffeological spaces.  In ([Hain](#Hain)) this is discussed in terms of Chen smooth spaces.


### Embedding of Fréchet manifolds into diffeological spaces {#RelationBetweenDeffeologicalAndFrechetStructure}

We discuss a natural embedding of [[Fréchet manifolds]] into the category of  diffeological spaces.

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

Define a [[functor]]

$$
  \iota \colon FrechetManifolds \to DiffeologicalSpaces
$$

in the evident way by taking for $X$ a [[Fréchet manifold]] for any $U \in $ [[CartSp]] the set of $U$-plots of $\iota(X)$ to be the set of smooth functions $U \to X$.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

The functor $\iota \colon FrechetManifolds \hookrightarrow DiffeologicalSpaces$ is a [[full and faithful functor]].

=--

This appears as ([Losik 94, theorem 3.1.1](#Losik)), as variant of the analogous statement for [[Banach manifolds]] in ([Hain](#Hain)). The fact that maps between Fréchet spaces are smooth if and only if they send smooth curves to smooth curves was proved earlier in ([Frölicher 81, théorème 1](#Frolicher))

The statement is also implied by ([Kriegl-Michor 97, cor. 3.14](#KrieglMichor)) which states that functions between [[locally convex vector spaces]] are diffeologically smooth precisely if they send smooth [[curves]] to smooth curves. This is not true if one uses [[Michal-Bastiani smooth map|Michal-Bastiani smoothness]] ([Glöckner 06](#Glockner06)), in which case one merely has a [[faithful functor]] $lctvs \to DiffeologicalSpaces$. Notice that the choice of topology in ([Kriegl-Michor 97](#KrieglMichor)) is such that this equivalence of notions reduces to the above just for Fr&eacute;chet manifolds.


+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

Let $X, Y \in SmoothManifold$ with $X$ a [[compact manifold]]. 

Then under this embedding, the diffeological mapping space structure $C^\infty(X,Y)_{diff}$ on the mapping space coincides with the Fréchet manifold structure $C^\infty(X,Y)_{Fr}$:

$$
  \iota(C^\infty(X,Y)_{Fr})
  \simeq
  C^\infty(X,Y)_{diff}
  \,.
$$

=--

This appears as ([Waldorf, lemma A.1.7](#Waldorf)).



### Embedding of diffeological spaces into the topos of smooth spaces
 {#EmbeddingOfDiffeologicalSpacesIntoTheSheafTopos}

We discuss aspects of the full [[sheaf topos]] $Sh(CartSp)$ on the [[site]] [[CartSp]] -- the topos of _[[smooth spaces]]_ -- and of how diffeological spaces are embedded into this. In summary, we have that $Sh(CartSp)$ is a [[cohesive topos]] and that $DiffeologicalSpace \hookrightarrow Sh(CartSp)$ is the canonical sub-[[quasitopos]] of [[concrete sheaves]] inside it.

#### Connectedness {#Connectedness}

The full [[sheaf topos]] $Sh(CartSp)$ on [[CartSp]] is a [[locally connected topos]] in that the terminal [[global section]] [[geometric morphism]] to [[Set]] is an [[essential geometric morphism]]:

$$
  Sh(CartSp)
  \stackrel{\overset{\Pi_0}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{L Const}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma}{\to}}}
  Set
$$

The extra [[left adjoint]] $\Pi_0 : Sh(CartSp) \to Set$ sends diffeological spaces to the set of path-[[connected]] components of their underlying [[topological space]]s.


+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The [[sheaf topos]] $Sh(CartSp)$ on [[CartSp]] is a [[locally connected topos]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The following argument works for every [[site]] $C$ which is such that constant presheaves on $C$ are already sheaves.

Notice that this is the case for $C = CartSp$ because every Cartesian space is connected: for $S \in Set$ a compatible family of elements of $Const S$ on a cover $\{U_i \to \mathbb{R}^n\}$ of some $\mathbb{R}^n$ is an element of $S$ on each patch, such that their restriction maps to intersections of patches coincide. But the restriction maps are all identities, so this says that all these elements coincide. Therefore the set of compatible families is just the set $S$ itself, hence the presheaf $Const S$ is a sheaf.

So with $L : PSh(C) \to Sh(C)$ the [[sheafification]] functor we have that $L Const S \simeq Const S$.

Whenever this is the case the [[left adjoint]] to the constant presheaf functor, which always exists for presheaves and is given by the [[colimit]] functor, is also left adjoint on the level of sheaves, because for each $X \in Sh(C)$ and $S \in Set$ we have natural bijections

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    Hom_{Sh(C)}(X, L Const S)
    & =
    Hom_{PSh(C)}(X, L Const S)
    \\
    & \simeq
    Hom_{PSh(C)}(X, Const S)
    \\
    & \simeq
    Hom_{Set}(\lim_\to X, S)
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Write $\Pi_0 := \lim_\to : Sh(CartSp) \to Set$
for the [[left adjoint]] to $LConst : Set \stackrel{Const}{\to} PSh(C) \stackrel{L}{\to} Sh(C)$.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

For $X \in Sh(C)$ a diffeological space, $\Pi_0(X)$ is the set of path-connected components of the topological space underlying $X$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the [[co-Yoneda lemma]] we may write 

$$
  X = {\lim_\to}_{(U \to X) \in y/X} U
$$

and since $\Pi_0$ commutes with colimits we have

$$
  \Pi_0(X) \simeq 
  \Pi_0 {\lim_\to}_{(U \to X)} U
  \simeq
  {\lim_\to}_{(U \to X)} \Pi_0(U)
  \,.
$$

But also by the co-Yoneda lemma we have that the [[colimit]] over any [[representable functor|representable]] is the singleton set, hence our expression

$$
  \cdots \simeq 
  {\lim_\to}_{(U \to X)} *
$$

is the colimit over the category of plots of $X$ of the functor that is constant on the point. This colimit is the [[coproduct]] of points over the connected components of the [[diagram]] category.

The connected components of the category of plots $y/X$ are the path-connected (or "plot-connected") components of the underlying topological space of $X$.



=--


+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The [[sheaf topos]] $Sh(CartSp)$ on [[CartSp]] is actually a [[connected topos]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Since $CartSp$ is a [[connected category]] it is immediate that $Const \colon Set \to PSh(CartSp)$ is a [[full and faithful functor]]. By the above this equals $L Const$, which is hence also full and faithful.

By the discussion at [[connected topos]] we could equivalently convince ourselves that $\Pi_0$ preserves the terminal object. The terminal object of $Sh(CartSp)$ is $y(\mathbb{R}^0)$, hence representable. By the above, $\Pi_0$ sends all representable objects to the singleton set, which is the terminal object of $Set$. 

=--


#### Locality {#Locality}

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition


The [[sheaf topos]] $Sh(CartSp)$ is also a [[local topos]]

$$
  (L Const \dashv \Gamma \dashv CoDisc)
  :
  Sh(CartSp) \stackrel{\overset{L Const}{\leftarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{\Gamma}{\to}}{\underset{CoDisc}{\leftarrow}}} 
  Set
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


The [[site]] [[CartSp]] is a [[local site]]: it has a [[terminal object]] and the only [[covering]] [[sieve]] of this object is the trivial one. This implies the claim, by the discussion at [[local site]].

Concretely, the extra [[right adjoint]] $CoDisc$ takes a [[set]] $S$ to the presheaf given by the assigmnent

$$
  CoDisc(S) : U \mapsto Hom_{Set}(CartSp(*,U), S)
  \,,
$$

that takes a Cartesian space $U$ to the set of [[function]]s from its underlying set of points to $S$. This is clearly a sheaf (a function of sets from $U$ to $S$ is clearly fixed by all its restrictions to a collections of  subsets of $U$ whose unition is $U$.)

=--

Geometrically, the object $CoDisc S \in Sh(CartSp)$ is the diffeological space [[codiscrete space|codiscrete]] (indiscrte) smooth structure.

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Every [[local topos]] comes with its notion of [[concrete sheaves]] that form a sub-[[quasitopos]]. For the local topos $Sh(CartSp)$ these are precisely the diffeological spaces.

$$
  Set \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\underset{CoDisc}{\hookrightarrow}}
  DiffologicalSp \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\hookrightarrow}
  Sh(CartSp)
$$


=--



+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


The [[concrete sheaves]] for the [[local topos]] $Sh(CartSp)$ are by definition those objects $X$ for which the 
$(\Gamma \dashv CoDisc)$-[[unit of an adjunction|unit]]

$$
  X \to CoDisc \Gamma X
$$

is a [[monomorphism]]. Monomorphisms of sheaves are tested objectwise, so that means equivalently that for every $U \in CartSp$ we have that 

$$
  X(U) \simeq Hom_{Sh}(U,X) \to Hom_{Sh}(U, Codisc \Gamma X)
  \simeq Hom_{Set}(\Gamma U, \Gamma X)
$$

is a monomorphism. This is precisely the condition on a sheaf to be a diffeological space.

#### Cohesiveness

###### Proposition

The [[sheaf topos]] $Sh(CartSp)$ is even a [[cohesive topos]] in which the axiom _pieces have points_ holds.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The [[site]] [[CartSp]] is a [[cohesive site]] (see there for detail). This implies the statement.

=--

This implies that $Sh(CartSp)$ is a [[locally connected topos]], [[connected topos]], [[local topos]]. It means in addition that it is also a [[strongly connected topos]].

This means that there is a _homotopy category_ or _concordance category_ of [[smooth spaces]], with the same objects as $Sh(CartSp)$, but with hom-sets given by

$$
  Conc(X,Y) := \Pi_0 [X,Y]_{Sh(CartSp)}
 \,,
$$

where $[X,Y]_{Sh(CartSp)}$ is the [[internal hom]] in the [[cartesian closed category]] $Sh(CartSp)$.

### Embedding of diffeological spaces into higher differential geometry
 {#EmbeddingOfDiffeologicalSpacesIntoHigherDifferentialGeometry}

In the last section we saw the embedding of diffeological spaces as precisely the [[concrete objects]] is the [[sheaf topos]] $Sh(CartSp) \simeq Sh(SmthMfd)$ of [[smooth spaces]]. This is a general context for [[differential geometry]]. From there one can pass further to [[higher differential geometry]]: the topos of smooth spaces in turn embeds

$$
  Sh(CartSp) \hookrightarrow
  Smooth \infty Grpd \coloneqq Sh_\infty(CartSp) 
$$

into the [[(∞,1)-topos]] [[Smooth∞Grpd]] of "higher [[smooth spaces]]" --[[smooth ∞-groupoids]] -- as precisely the [[truncated object in an (∞,1)-category|0-truncated objects]].
