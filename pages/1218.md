## Idea

A **diffeological space** is a type of [[generalized smooth space]].  As with the other variants, it subsumes the notion of [[smooth manifold]] but also naturally captures other spaces that one would like to think of as smooth spaces but aren't manifolds; for example, the space of all smooth maps between two smooth manifolds can be made into a diffeological space. (These mapping spaces are rarely manifolds themselves, see [[manifolds of mapping spaces]].)

In a little more detail, a **diffeology**, $\mathcal{D}$ on a set $X$ is a [[presheaf]] on the [[category of open subsets]] of Euclidean spaces with smooth maps as morphisms.  To each open set $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$, it assigns a subset of $\Set(U,X)$.  The functions in $\Set(U,X)$ are to be regarded as the "smooth functions" from $U$ to $X$.  A **diffeological space** is then a set together with a diffeology on it.

Diffeological spaces were originally introduced in ([Souriau 79](#Souriau79)). They have subsequently been developed in the textbook ([Iglesias-Zemmour 13](#PIZ))

## Definition

+-- {: mynumdef #DiffSp}
###### Definition
Let $\mathcal{Op}$ denote the [[site]] whose objects are the open subsets of the Euclidean spaces $\mathbb{R}^n$  and whose morphisms are [[smooth map]]s between these.

A **diffeological space** is a pair $(X,\mathcal{D})$ where 

* $X$ is a set 

* and $\mathcal{D} \in Sh(\mathcal{Op})$ is a **[[diffeology]]** on $X$:

  * a [[subobject|subsheaf]] of the sheaf $U \mapsto Hom_{Set}(U,X)$ with $\mathcal{D}(*) = X$

  * equivalently: a [[concrete sheaf]] on the [[site]] $\mathcal{Op}$ such that $\mathcal{D}(*) = X$ - a [[concrete object|concrete]] [[smooth space]] (see there for more details).

A [[morphism]] of diffeological spaces is a morphism of the corresponding [[sheaves]]: we take $DiffeologicalSp \hookrightarrow Sh(CartSp)$ to be the full [[subcategory]] on the diffeological spaces in the sheaf topos.

=--

For $(X,\mathcal{D})$ a diffeological space, and for any $U \in \mathcal{Op}$, the set $\mathcal{D}(U)$ is also called the set of **[[plots]]** in $X$ on $U$. This is to be thought of as the set of ways of mapping $U$ smoothly into the would-be space $X$. This assignment _defined_ what it means for a map $U \to X$ of sets to be smooth. 

For some comments on the reasoning behind this kind of definition of generalized [[space]]s see [[motivation for sheaves, cohomology and higher stacks]].

A sheaf on the site $\mathcal{Op}$ of open subsets of Euclidean spaces is completely specified by its restriction to [[CartSp]], the full subcategory of [[Cartesian space]]: The [[fully faithful functor]] $CartSp \hookrightarrow \mathcal{Op}$ is a [[dense subsite]]-inclusion.  Therefore in the sequel we shall often restrict our attention to [[CartSp]].

One may define a _[[smooth sets]]_ to be _any_ sheaf of [[CartSp]].
A diffeological space is equivalently a [[concrete sheaf]] on the [[concrete site]] [[CartSp]]. (For details see [this Prop.](geometry+of+physics+--+smooth+sets#DiffeologicalSpacesAreTheConcreteSmoothSets) at _[[geometry of physics -- smooth sets]]_.)


The [[full subcategory]]

$$
  DiffeologicalSpaces \hookrightarrow Sh(CartSp)
$$

on all concrete sheaves is not a [[topos]], but is a [[quasitopos]].

This is Prop. \ref{DiffeologicalSpacesAreTheConcreteSmoothSets} below.

The concreteness condition on the sheaf is a reiteration of the fact that a diffeological space is a subsheaf of the sheaf $U \mapsto X^{|U|}$.  In this way, one does not have to explicitly mention the underlying set $X$ as it is determined by the sheaf on the one-point open subset of $\mathbb{R}^0$.


## Examples

* Every [[smooth manifold]] $X$, i.e. every object of [[Diff]], becomes a diffeological space by defining the [[plots]] on $U \in CartSp$ to be the ordinary [[smooth function]]s from $U$ to $X$, i.e. the morphisms in [[Diff]]:

  $$  
    X : U \mapsto Hom_{Diff}(U,X)
    \,.
  $$

* For $X$ and $Y$ two diffeological spaces, their [[product]] as sets $X \times Y$ becomes a diffeological space whose [[plots]] are pairs consisting of a [[plot]] into $X$ and one into $Y$

  $$
    X \times Y : U \mapsto Hom_{DiffSp}(U,X) \times Hom_{DiffSp}(U,Y)
    \,.
  $$

* Given any two diffeological spaces $X$ and $Y$, the set of 
  morphisms $Hom_{DiffSp}(X,Y)$ becomes a smooth space by taking 
  the [[plots]] on some $U$ to be the smooth morphisms $X \times U \to Y$, 
  i.e. the smooth $U$-parameterized families of smooth maps from $X$ to $Y$:

  $$
    [X,Y] : U \mapsto Hom_{DiffSp}(X \times U, Y)
    \,.
  $$

  In this formula we regard $U \in CartSp \hookrightarrow Diff$ 
  as a diffeological space according to the above example. 
  In fact, we apply secretly here the [[Yoneda embedding]] 
  and use the general formula for the 
  cartesian [[closed monoidal structure on presheaves]].

\begin{proposition}\label{InternalHomOnDTopSpacesHasCorrectWeakType}
  For $X, A \,\in\, DTopSp \hookrightarrow TopSp$ a [[pair]] of [[D-topological spaces]], their [[internal hom]] formed in diffeological spaces has diffeological [[singular simplicial complex]] [[weak homotopy equivalence|weakly homotopy equivalent]] to the ordinary [[singular simplicial set]] of the ordinary [[mapping space]] $Maps_{Top}$ with its [[compact-open topology]]:

$$
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
By [SYH 10](#SYH10) we have the following morphism:
$$
  Cdfflg
  \big(
    Maps_{Top}(X,\,A)
  \big)
  \underoverset
    { \in Cdfflg(\mathrm{W}_{wh}) }

    \mathbf{smap}(X ,\, A)
  \big)
  \;\;
  \simeq
  \;\;
  Maps_{dfflg}
  (X,\, A)
  \,,
$$
where $\mathbf{smap}$ is some topologization of the set of maps (defined on their [p. 6](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1010.3336.pdf#page=6) ) of which all we need to know is that:

1. its image under $Cdfflg$ is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the internal hom in diffeological spaces, according to their Prop. 4.7 ([p. 7](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1010.3336.pdf#page=7)),

1. it is [[weak homotopy equivalence|weak homotopy equivalent]], via some map $\phi$ according to their Prop. 5.4 ([p. 9](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1010.3336.pdf#page=9)) to the compact-open topology.

Hence the claim follows by the naturality of the weak homotopy equivalence from Prop. \ref{TopologicalHomotopyTypeIsCohesiveShapeOfCdfflg}
$$
  Sing_{diff} \circ Cdfflg 
  \;
  \underoverset
    {\in \mathrm{W}_{wh}}

### Embedding of smooth manifolds into diffeological spaces
 {#EmbeddingOfSmoothManifoldsIntoDiffeoloticalSpaces}

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The obvious functor from the [[category]] [[SmoothManifolds]] of [[smooth manifolds]] to the [[category]] [[DiffeologicalSpaces]] of diffeological spaces is a [[full and faithful functor]]

$$
  SmoothManifolds \hookrightarrow  DiffeologicalSpacess
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

This is a direct consequence of the fact that [[CartSp]]$_{smooth}$ is a [[dense sub-site]] of [[SmoothManifolds]] and the [[Yoneda lemma]]. 

It may nevertheless be useful to spell out the elementary proof directly:

To see that the functor is faithful, notice that if $f,g : X \to Y$ are two [[smooth function]]s that differ at some point, then they must differ in some [[open neighbourhood]] of that point. This [[open ball]] is a [[plot]], hence the corresponding diffeological spaces differ on that [[plot]].

To see that the functor is full, we need to show that a map of sets $f : X \to Y$ that sends [[plots]] to [[plots]] is necessarily a [[smooth function]], hence that all its [[derivative]]s exist. This can be tested already on all smooth curves $\gamma : (0,1) \to X$ in $X$. By [[Boman's theorem]], a function that takes all smooth curves to smooth curves is necessarily a smooth function. But curves are in particular [[plots]], so a function that takes all [[plots]] of $X$ to [[plots]] of $Y$ must be smooth.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

The proof shows that we could restrict attention to the full sub-site $CartSp_{dim \leq 1} \subset CartSp$ on the objects $\mathbb{R}^0$ and $\mathbb{R}^1$ and still have a full and faithful embedding

$$
  Diff \hookrightarrow Sh(CartSp_{dim \leq 1})
  \,.
$$

This fact plays a role in the definition of [[Fr√∂licher space]]s, which are [[generalized smooth space]]s defined by [[plots]] by curves into and out of them.

While the site $CartSp_{dim \leq 1}$ is more convenient for some purposes, it is not so useful for other purposes, mostly when diffeological spaces are regarded from the point of view of the full sheaf topos: the sheaf topos $Sh(CartSp_{dim \leq 1})$ lacks some non-[[concrete sheaf|concrete]] sheaves of interest, such as the sheaves of differential forms of degree $\geq 2$.

### Embedding of Fr&#233;chet manifolds into diffeological spaces {#RelationBetweenDeffeologicalAndFrechetStructure}

We discuss a natural embedding of [[Fr√©chet manifolds]] into the category of  diffeological spaces.

###### Definition

Define a [[functor]]

$$
  \iota \colon FrechetManifolds \to DiffeologicalSpaces
$$

in the evident way by taking for $X$ a [[Fr√©chet manifold]] for any $U \in $ [[CartSp]] the set of $U$-[[plots]] of $\iota(X)$ to be the set of smooth functions $U \to X$.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #FrechetEmbedding}
###### Proposition

The functor $\iota \colon FrechetManifolds \hookrightarrow DiffeologicalSpaces$ is a [[full and faithful functor]].

=--

This appears as ([Losik 94, theorem 3.1.1](#Losik94), following [Losik 92](#Losik92)), as variant of the analogous statement for [[Banach manifolds]] in ([Hain](#Hain)). The fact that maps between Fr&#233;chet spaces are smooth if and only if they send smooth curves to smooth curves was proved earlier in ([Fr&#246;licher 81, th&#233;or&#232;me 1](#Frolicher))

The statement is also implied by ([Kriegl-Michor 97, cor. 3.14](#KrieglMichor)) which states that functions between [[locally convex vector spaces]] are diffeologically smooth precisely if they send smooth [[curves]] to smooth curves. This is not true if one uses [[Michal-Bastiani smooth map|Michal-Bastiani smoothness]] ([Gl&#246;ckner 06](#Glockner06)), in which case one merely has a [[faithful functor]] $lctvs \to DiffeologicalSpaces$. Notice that the choice of topology in ([Kriegl-Michor 97](#KrieglMichor)) is such that this equivalence of notions reduces to the above just for Fr&#233;chet manifolds.


+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

Let $X, Y \in SmoothManifold$ with $X$ a [[compact manifold]]. 

Then under this embedding, the diffeological mapping space structure $C^\infty(X,Y)_{diff}$ on the mapping space coincides with the Fr&#233;chet manifold structure $C^\infty(X,Y)_{Fr}$:

$$
  \iota(C^\infty(X,Y)_{Fr})
  \simeq
  C^\infty(X,Y)_{diff}
  \,.

### Embedding of diffeological spaces into smooth sets
 {#EmbeddingOfDiffeologicalSpacesIntoTheSheafTopos}

We discuss how diffeological spaces are equivalently the [[concrete objects]] in the [[cohesive topos]] of [[smooth sets]] (see [there](smooth+set#Cohesion)).


+-- {: .num_prop #DiffeologicalSpacesAreTheConcreteSmoothSets}
###### Proposition
**(diffeological spaces are the concrete smooth sets)**

The [[full subcategory]] on the [[concrete objects]] in the [[topos]] $SmoothSet \coloneqq Sh(Cart)$ of [[smooth sets]] is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to the category of diffeological spaces

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


The [[concrete sheaves]] for the [[local topos]] $Sh(CartSp)$ are by definition those objects $X$ for which the 
$(\Gamma \dashv CoDisc)$-[[unit of an adjunction|unit]]

$$
  X \to CoDisc \Gamma X
$$

is a [[monomorphism]]. Monomorphisms of sheaves are tested objectwise, so that means equivalently that for every $U \in CartSp$ we have that 

$$
  X(U) \simeq Hom_{Sh}(U,X) \to Hom_{Sh}(U, Codisc \Gamma X)
  \simeq Hom_{Set}(\Gamma U, \Gamma X)
$$

is a monomorphism. This is precisely the condition on a sheaf to be a diffeological space.

### Embedding of diffeological spaces into higher differential geometry
 {#EmbeddingOfDiffeologicalSpacesIntoHigherDifferentialGeometry}

In the last section we saw the embedding of diffeological spaces as precisely the [[concrete objects]] is the [[sheaf topos]] $Sh(CartSp) \simeq Sh(SmthMfd)$ of [[smooth sets]]. This is a general context for [[differential geometry]]. From there one can pass further to [[higher differential geometry]]: the topos of smooth sets in turn embeds

$$
  Sh(CartSp) \hookrightarrow
  Smooth \infty Grpd \coloneqq Sh_\infty(CartSp) 
$$

into the [[(‚àû,1)-topos]] [[Smooth‚àûGrpd]] of "higher [[smooth sets]]" --[[smooth ‚àû-groupoids]] -- as precisely the [[truncated object in an (‚àû,1)-category|0-truncated objects]].

### Distribution theory

Since a space of [[smooth functions]] on a [[smooth manifold]] is canonically a diffeological space, it is natural to consider the _smooth_ [[linear functionals]] on such [[mapping spaces]]. These turn out to be equivalent to the [[continuous linear functionals]], hence to [[distributional densities]]. See at _[[distributions are the smooth linear functionals]]_ for details.

### General
  {#ReferencesGeneral}

The basic idea of understanding [[generalized smooth spaces]] as [[concrete sheaves]] on a [[site]] of smooth test spaces originates in work of [[Kuo Tsai Chen]] (see also at _[[Chen space]]_):

* {#Chen73} [[Kuo Tsai Chen]], _Iterated integrals of differential forms and loop space homology_, Ann. Math. 97 (1973), 217&#8211;246 ([jstor:1970846](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1970846))

Chen considered (apart from [[iterated integrals]]) effectively [[presheaves]] on a site of [[convex subsets]] of [[Cartesian spaces]]. In

* {#Chen75} [[Kuo Tsai Chen]], _Iterated integrals, fundamental groups and covering spaces_, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 206 (1975), 83&#8211;98 ([jstor:1997148](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1997148))

roughly the [[sheaf]] condition was added (without using any of this sheaf-theoretic terminology). The definition of _[[Chen spaces]]_ stabilized in

* {#Chen77} [[Kuo Tsai Chen]], _Iterated path integrals_, Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 83, (1977), 831&#8211;879 ([euclid:1183539443](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.bams/1183539443))

and served as the basis of a celebrated theorem on the [[de Rham cohomology]] of [[loop spaces]].

A brief review is in 

* [[Kuo-Tsai Chen]], _On differentiable spaces_, in:  [[William Lawvere]], [[Stephen Schanuel]] (eds.), _[[Categories in Continuum Physics]]_, Lectures given at a Workshop held at SUNY, Buffalo 1982, Lecture Notes in Mathematics 1174, 1986 ([doi:10.1007/BFb0076928](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/BFb0076928))

(which, curiously, still does not make the connection to the theory of sheaves).

{#However} However, Chen does not require the domains of his plots to be [[open subsets]], which makes Chen spaces be closely related to but different from [[diffeological spaces]] (see [Stacey 11, p. 32](#Stacey11)) 

The proper concept of diffeological spaces was introduced, under the name _diff&eacute;ologie_ and apparently independently from Chen, in:
