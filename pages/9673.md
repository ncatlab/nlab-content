


If $(\mathcal{C}, \otimes)$ is a [[monoidal category]] and $X \in \mathcal{C}$ a [[dualizable object]] with [[dual object]] $X^\ast$, the structure morphism

$$
  \mathbb{I} \to X \otimes X^\ast
$$

is also called the _coevaluation map_, in contrast to the other structure map

$$
  X^\ast \otimes X \to \mathbb{I}
$$

which is the [[evaluation map]].
