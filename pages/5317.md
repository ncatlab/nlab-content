## Idea

The _sphere spectrum_ is the simplest nontrivial [[spectrum]].


## Definition 

The **sphere spectrum** is the [[suspension spectrum]] of the point.

## Properties

The sphere spectrum is naturally an [[E-∞ ring]] and in fact is the [[initial object]] in the [[(∞,1)-category]] of [[ring spectra]]. It is the higher version of the [[ring]] $\mathbb{}$ of [[integer]]s.
