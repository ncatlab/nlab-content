Wow, time flies! I'm now a Ph.D. student at UT Austin, and you can find some of my writing and stuff on my [department home page](http://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/afenyes). Things I'm thinking about these days include...
* Quadratic differentials, [spectral networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.4824), and $SL_2\mathbb{C}$ connections on Riemann surfaces (for a reading course).
* Classical and quantum $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ gauge theories on compact surfaces (for a [math club](http://www.ma.utexas.edu/mathclub/) talk).
* What the $\clubsuit\ast\mho\heartsuit$ is going on in [this paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.4170) (for a graduate geometry seminar).
* Markov algorithms (maybe for a middle school summer program somewhere, someday).

### October 2009 ###

I'm a master's student interested in mathematical physics. Or is it physical mathematics? Here are some things I've been wondering about lately...
* The [general boundary formulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0509122) of quantum field theory.
* Whether or not it would be pedagogically useful to introduce topology as a special case of [[pretopological space|pretopology]].

Welcome, Aaron!  It might be good if you used your full name, although I don\'t think anybody will try to force you.

It also helps if you log your changes in the [latest changes](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Mathforge/nForum/?CategoryID=5) category of the Forum.  In particular, people will be much more likely to look at your work on [[induced representation]] if you do that.

I have also thought that pretopological spaces are pedagogically simpler than topological spaces.  I also like to motivate [[uniform spaces]] as a uniform version of pretopological rather than topological spaces (although we do have the theorem that any pretopological uniform space is topological).  On the other hand, now that I\'m getting to [[locale]] theory, I\'m not as interested in pretopological spaces ....
