##Idea##

and cinquefoil

knots.


##Definition##
 A knot $K$ is said to be a _torus knot_ if it can be embedded in the surface of a torus, that is, we have the map $K : S^1\to \mathbb{R}^3$ factors through the embedding of some torus $T_1\cong S^1\times S^1$ into $\mathbb{R}^3$;

$$S^1\stackrel{K}{\to}T_1\stackrel{embed}{\to} \mathbb{R}^3$$
