## Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$
a [[morphism]] $f \colon X \to Y$ in an [[(infinity,1)-category]] is an **$n$-monomorphism** equivalently if 

* in its [[n-image]] factorization

  $$
    f \colon X \to im_n(f) \to Y
  $$

  the first morphism is an [[equivalence in an (infinity,1)-category]]

* it is an [[n-connected|(n-2)-truncated morphism]];

Similarly a [[function]] $f \colon X \to Y$ in [[homotopy type theory]] is an $n$-monomorphism if its $n$-image factorization is via an [[equivalence in homotopy type theory]].

The dual concept is that of _[[n-epimorphism]]_.

## Examples

* $\infty$-monomorphism are precisely the [[equivalences]]. 

* Every morphism is a $0$-monomorphism.

* 1-Monomorphisms are often just called [[monomorphisms in an (∞,1)-category]].

* A 1-monomorphism between [[0-truncated]] objects is precisely an ordinary [[monomorphism]] in the underlying [[1-topos]].
