## Idea

A _dualizing object_ is an object $a$ which can be regarded as being an object of two different [[categories]] $A$ and $B$, such that the concrete [[duality]] which is induced by homming into that object induces dual [[adjunctions]] between $A$ and $B$, schematically:

$$
  T : A^{op} \stackrel{Hom_A(-,a)}{\to} B
$$
$$
  S: B^{op} \stackrel{Hom_B(-,a)}{\to} A
  \,.
$$

Many famous dualities are induced this way, for instance [[Stone duality]] and [[Gelfand-Naimark duality]].

## Remark on terminology

There are various different terms for "dualizing objects". As recalled on p. 112 of the article by Porst and Tholen below

* Isbell speaks of _objects keeping summer and winter homes_;

* Lawvere speaks of _objects sitting in two categories_;

* Simmons speaks of _schizophrenic objects_.

It has been convincingly argued by [[Tom Leinster]] (blog comment [here](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2007/01/more_on_duality.html#c007089)) that the term "schizophrenic" should not be used. [[Todd Trimble]] then suggested the term "ambimorphic object."  Another suggestion was "Janusian object."

## Definition

Let $A$ and $B$ be two categories over $Set$, given by functors 

$$
  U : A \to Set
$$
$$
  V : B \to Set
  \,.
$$ 

(Traditionally in what follows, one assumed $U$ and $V$ to be faithful, i.e., one considered $A$ and $B$ to be categories of sets with [[stuff, structure, property|extra structure]], aka [[concrete categories]], although we won't actually need this. Or, sometimes one sees the hypothesis that $U, V$ are representable, but we won't require this either.) 

The situation described in the Idea section asks us to consider contravariantly [[adjoint functors]] $T: A \to B$, $S: B \to A$ such that $U S: B \to Set$ and $V T: A \to Set$ are representable, i.e., are given by isomorphisms $B(-, \mathbf{b}) \cong U S$ (with representing element $\phi \in U S \mathbf{b}$) and $A(-, \mathbf{a}) \cong V T$ (with representing element $\psi \in V T \mathbf{a}$). Let $\eta: 1_A \to S T$ and $\epsilon: 1_B \to T S$ denote the universal maps of the adjunction (so that if we write $T$ and $S$ in covariant form as $T: A \to B^{op}$ and $S: B^{op} \to A$, we would have $T \dashv S$ with $\eta$ as unit and $\epsilon$ as counit).

###### Proposition 
The representing data $\phi \in U S \mathbf{b}, \psi \in V T \mathbf{a}$ induce a canonical isomorphism $\omega: U \mathbf{a} \stackrel{\sim}{\to} V \mathbf{b}$. It is given by the evident composite 

$$U \mathbf{a} \stackrel{U\eta \mathbf{a}}{\to} U S T \mathbf{a} \stackrel{\sim}{\to} B(T \mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}) \to Set(V T \mathbf{a}, V \mathbf{b}) \stackrel{eval_\psi}{\to} V \mathbf{b}.$$ 

The inverse is given by a similar composite but switching the roles of $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$, $\phi$ and $\psi$, $\eta$ and $\epsilon$, $S$ and $T$, and $U$ and $V$. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
Letting $x$ be an element of $U \mathbf{a}$, the element $\omega(x) \in V \mathbf{b}$ is by definition $(V g)(\psi)$ where $g: T \mathbf{a} \to \mathbf{b}$ is the unique map (by representability) such that $(U \eta \mathbf{a})(x) = (U S g)(\phi)$. The alleged inverse $\widebar{\omega}: V \mathbf{b} \to U \mathbf{a}$ takes an element $y \in V \mathbf{b}$ to $(U f)(\phi)$, where $f: S \mathbf{b} \to \mathbf{a}$ is the unique map such that $(V T f)(\psi) = (V \epsilon \mathbf{b})(y)$. 

To check these maps are inverse, one may check simply $(\omega \widebar{\omega})(y) = y$ for any $y \in V \mathbf{b}$; the other equation $\widebar{\omega} \omega = id$ follows by symmetry. With notation as above, put $x = \widebar{\omega}(y)$, so $x = (U f)(\phi) \in U \mathbf{a}$. Now we embark on a diagram chase, starting with 

$$\array{
U S \mathbf{b} & \stackrel{U f}{\to} & U \mathbf{a} & \stackrel{U \eta \mathbf{a}}{\to} & U S T \mathbf{a} \\ 
 _\mathllap{\phi} \uparrow & \searrow_\mathrlap{U \eta S \mathbf{b}} & & _\mathllap{U S T f} \nearrow & \uparrow_\mathrlap{\cong} \\ 
1 & & U S T S \mathbf{b} & & B(T \mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}) \\ 
 & _\mathllap{\xi} \searrow & \uparrow_\mathrlap{\cong} & \nearrow _\mathrlap{B(T f, \mathbf{b})} \\ 
 & & B(T S \mathbf{b}, \mathbf{b}) & & 
}$$ 

where the top and right quadrilaterals commute by naturality, and $\xi: T S \mathbf{b} \to \mathbf{b}$ is the unique arrow making the left quadrilateral commute. In fact $\xi$ is the structure map for a $T S$-algebra structure on $\mathbf{b}$, although for our purposes we will only need the unit axiom for such a structure. Following the perimeter of this diagram, we see 

$$g = (T \mathbf{a} \stackrel{T f}{\to} T S \mathbf{b} \stackrel{\xi}{\to} \mathbf{b})$$ 

is the unique arrow $g: T \mathbf{a} \to \mathbf{b}$ such that $(U S g)(\phi) = (U \eta \mathbf{a})(x)$. Continuing on our way, applying $V$ to $g$ and evaluating at $\psi$, we have only to check that the composite 

$$1 \stackrel{\psi}{\to} V T \mathbf{a} \stackrel{V T f}{\to} V T S \mathbf{b} \stackrel{V \xi}{\to} V \mathbf{b}$$ 

equals $y: 1 \to V \mathbf{b}$. But already we said $(V T f)(\psi) = (V \epsilon \mathbf{b})(y)$, so the last composite is 

$$1 \stackrel{y}{\to} V \mathbf{b} \stackrel{V \epsilon \mathbf{b}}{\to} V T S \mathbf{b} \stackrel{V \xi}{\to} V \mathbf{b}$$ 

and all we need to do now is check the unit equation $\xi \circ (\epsilon \mathbf{b}) = 1_\mathbf{b}$. But this follows from representability of $U S$, applied to the diagram 

$$\array{
U S \mathbf{b} & \stackrel{U \eta S \mathbf{b}}{\to} & U S T S \mathbf{b} & \stackrel{U S \epsilon \mathbf{b}}{\to} & U S \mathbf{b} \\ 
 _\mathllap{\phi} \uparrow & & \uparrow_\mathrlap{\cong} & & \uparrow_\mathrlap{\cong} \\ 
1 & \underset{\xi}{\to} & B(T S \mathbf{b}, \mathbf{b}) & \underset{B(\epsilon \mathbf{b}, \mathbf{b})}{\to} & B(\mathbf{b}, \mathbf{b}) 
}$$ 

where the top horizontal composite is an identity, according to a triangular equation. 
=-- 


The canonical identification of sets $\omega: U \mathbf{a} = V \mathbf{b}$ means that we have an object "sitting in two categories" (Lawvere), namely an $A$-structure $\mathbf{a}$ on this set and a $B$-structure $\mathbf{b}$ on the same set, with $T: A^{op} \to B$ providing a lift of $A(-, \mathbf{a}): A^{op} \to Set$ through $V: B \to Set$, and $S: B^{op} \to A$ lifting $B(-, \mathbf{b}): B^{op} \to Set$ through $U: A \to Set$. Thus the triplet $(\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}, \omega: U \mathbf{a} \stackrel{\sim}{\to} V \mathbf{b})$ forms what may be called an ($(A, B)$-)*ambimorphic object*, living in an evident pseudo-pullback of $U$ and $V$ [check that this is the correct terminology] which we denote by $Ambi(U, V)$. 

Given functors $U: A \to Set$, $V: B \to Set$, let $Adj_{rep}(U, V)$ be the category whose objects are contravariantly adjoint pairs $(S: B \to A, T: A \to B)$ such that $U S$ and $V T$ are representable. Morphisms $(S, T) \to (S', T')$ are pairs of natural transformations $\alpha: S \to S'$, $\beta: T \to T'$ such that the diagrams 

$$\array{
1_A & \stackrel{\eta'}{\to} & S' T' \\ 
 _\mathllap{\eta} \downarrow & & \downarrow_\mathrlap{S' \beta} \\ 
S T & \underset{\alpha T}{\to} & S' T
}$$ 

$$\,$$ 

$$\array{
T S' & \stackrel{T \alpha}{\to} & T S \\ 
 _\mathllap{\beta S'} \downarrow & & \downarrow_\mathrlap{\epsilon} \\ 
T' S' & \underset{\epsilon'}{\to} & 1_B 
}$$ 

commute. In conjunction with the [[Yoneda lemma]], the preceding proposition can be read as giving the construction of a functor $\Phi: Adj_{rep}(U, V) \to Ambi(U, V)$. 

We are now ready for the key definition. 

+-- {: .num_defn} 
###### Definition 
Given $U: A \to Set$, $V: B \to Set$, a $(U, V)$-**dualizing object** is an ambimorphic object in the essential image of $\Phi$. 
=-- 

The definition can be tightened by putting some more conditions on representable contravariant adjoint pairs $(S, T) \in Adj_{rep}(U, V)$, due to Dimov-Tholen (see the references below). Suppose given contravariant adjoint functors $S, T$ with $U S$ and $V T$ representable as above. We thus have maps 

$$\gamma \coloneqq (U \stackrel{U \eta}{\to} U S T \cong B(T-, \mathbf{b})), \qquad \delta \coloneqq (V \stackrel{V \epsilon}{\to} V T S \cong A(U-, \mathbf{a}))$$ 

so that for each object $a$ of $A$ and $x \in U a$, we have a corresponding map $(\gamma a)(x): T a \to \mathbf{b}$ (playing the role of $g$ in the proof of Proposition \ref{sitting}), and similarly for each object $b$ of $B$ and $y \in V b$, we have a map $(\delta b)(y): S b \to \mathbf{a}$ (playing the role of $f$ in Proposition \ref{sitting}). 

+-- {: .num_defn} 
###### Definition 
The adjunction between $S$ and $T$ is *naturally* represented if the family 
$\{(\gamma a)(x): T a \to \mathbf{b}\}_{x \in U a}$ is $V$-[[topological functor|initial]] for each $a \in Ob(A)$, and the family $\{(\delta b)(y): S b \to \mathbf{a}\}_{y \in V b}$ is $U$-initial for each $b \in Ob(B)$.

###### Proposition 
The restriction of $\Phi: Adj_{rep}(U, V) \to Ambi(U, V)$ to the full subcategory whose objects are naturally represented adjoint pairs is full and faithful.

## Examples

One easy general example is where $C$ is a [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]] [[monoidal closed category]] and $d$ is an object therein. Here we may take $U = V = C(I, -): C \to Set$ where $I$ is the monoidal unit, and the contravariant representable functor $C(-, d): C \to Set$ lifts to a contravariant enriched hom $[-, d]: C \to C$; the symmetry isomorphism can be exploited to show how $[-, d]$ is adjoint to itself. See [here](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/duality#concrete_dualities) for more.
