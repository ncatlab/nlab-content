## Idea

### Traditional

For $(X,\omega)$ a [[symplectic manifold]], the _symplectomorphism group_

$$
  Diff(X,\omega) \hookrightarrow Diff(X)
$$

is the [[subgroup]] of the [[diffeomorphism group]] of $X$ on the [[diffeomorphisms]].

### In higher symplectic geometry

Analogous constructions apply when symplectic manifolds are generalized to [[n-plectic infinity-groupoids]].

## Related concepts

A further subgroup is that of [[Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms]]. The [[group extension]] of that whose elements are pairs consisting of a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism and a choice of [[Hamiltonian]] for this is the [[quantomorphism group]]. 

The [[Lie algebra]] of the symplectomorphism group is that of [[symplectic vector fields]].
