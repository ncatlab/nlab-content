## Idea

### Traditional

For $(X,\omega)$ a [[symplectic manifold]], the _symplectomorphism group_

$$
  Diff(X,\omega) \hookrightarrow Diff(X)
$$

is the [[subgroup]] of the [[diffeomorphism group]] of $X$ on the [[diffeomorphisms]].

### In higher symplectic geometry

Analogous constructions apply when symplectic manifolds are generalized to [[n-plectic infinity-groupoids]]: for $(X, \omega)$ an [[n-plectic manifold]], and **$n$-plectomorphism** is a [[diffeomorphism]] $\phi : X \to X$ that preserves the $n$-plectic form $\phi^* X \simeq X$.

## Examples

* The linear part of the 2-plectomorphism group/3-plectomorphism group of the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^7$ equipped with its associative 3-form $\omega = \lanlge (-), (-) \times (-)\rangle$ is the [[exceptional Lie group]] [[G2]]. See there for more details.
 
## Related concepts

A further subgroup is that of [[Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms]]. The [[group extension]] of that whose elements are pairs consisting of a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism and a choice of [[Hamiltonian]] for this is the [[quantomorphism group]]. 

The [[Lie algebra]] of the symplectomorphism group is that of [[symplectic vector fields]].
