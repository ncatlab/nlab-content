## Definition

Let $X$ and $X$ be [[smooth manifolds]] of finite [[dimension]].
Let $f : X \to Y$ be a [[differentiable function]].

###### Definition


The function $f : X \to Y$ is called an **immersion** precisely if the canonical morphism

$$
  T X \to X \times_Y T Y \eqqcolon f^* T Y
$$

is a [[monomorphism]]. 

=--

This morphism is the one induced from the [[universal property]] of the [[pullback]] by the [[commuting diagram]]

$$
  \array{
    T X &\stackrel{d f}{\to}& T Y
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    X &\stackrel{f}{\to}&  Y
  }
$$

given by the [[differential]] of $f$ going between the [[tangent bundles]].

Equivalently this means the following.

###### Definition

The function $f : X \to Y$ is an immersion precisely if for every point $x \in X$ the [[differential]] 

$$
  d f|_x : T_x X \to T_{f(y)} Y
$$ 

between the [[tangent space]] of $X$ at $x$ and the tangent space of $Y$ at $f(y)$ is an [[injection]].

An immersion whose underlying [[continuous function]] is an [[embedding]] of [[topological spaces]] is an _[[embedding of smooth manifolds]]_.

## Properties

### Relation to embeddings

An immersion $f : X \to Y$ is precisely a _local [[embedding of smooth manifolds|embeddings]]_: for every point $x \in X$ there is an [[open neighbourhood]] $x \in U \subset X$ such that $f|_U : U \to Y$ is an [[embedding of smooth manifolds]].




### Characterization in infinitesimal cohesion

A [[smooth function]] $f : X \to Y$ between [[smooth manifolds]] is canonically regarded as a morphism in the [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] [[SynthDiff∞Grpd]]. With respect to the canonical [[infinitesimal cohesion|infinitesimal neighbourhood inclusion]] $i : $ [[Smooth∞Grpd]] $\hookrightarrow$ [[SynthDiff∞Grpd]] there is a notion of [[formally unramified morphism]] in $SynthDiff\infty Grpd$.

$f$ is an immersion precisely if it is formally unramified with respect to this infinitesimal cohesion.

See the discussion at [[SynthDiff∞Grpd]] for details.

## Variants

The [[algebraic geometry]] analogue of a submersion is a [[smooth morphism of schemes|smooth morphism]].

The analogue between arbitrary [[topological spaces]] (not manifolds) is simply an [[open map]]. There is also [[topological submersion]], of which there are two versions.
