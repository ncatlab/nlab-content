
Currently there are two main ways to search for content on the $n$Lab:

* use Google, add the command "site:http://nlab.mathforge.org/nlab/" in the Google search box.

  This is usually the best way to find content for a given keyword.

* Use the search box on the top of each page. This performs a regexp-search through the _source code_ of the $n$Lab pages. So this is for more sophisticated searches when you know what you are doing.
