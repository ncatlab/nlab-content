## Idea

What is called _KR-theory_ ([Atiyah 66](#Atiyah66)) is variant of [[topological K-theory]] on [[spaces]] equipped with a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-[[action]] (by [[homeomorphism]], hence equipped with one [[involution|involutive]] homeomorphism -- a "[[real space]]").

In terms of [[cocycle]] models, classes of KR-theory are represented by [[complex vector bundles]] over $X$ on which the involution on their base space lifts to an _anti-linear_ involution of the total space. Over manifolds with trivial involution these are precisely the [[complexification]] of [[real vector bundles]] and hence over such spaces $KR$-theory reduces to [[KO]]-[[cohomology theory|theory]]. Conversely, over two copies $X \cup X$ lof $X$ equipped with the involution that interchanges the two, $KR$-theory reduces to [[KU]]-[[cohomology theory|theory]]. Finally over $X \times S^1$ with the involution the antipodal identification on the second ([[circle]]) factor , $KR$-theory reduces to the self-conjugate [[KSC-theory]] ([Anderson 64](#Anderson64)). So in general $KR$-theory interpolates between all these cases. For instance on $X \times S^1$ with the reflection-involution on the circle it behaves like $KO$-theory at the two involution fixed points (the two [[O-planes]]) and like $KU$ in their complement (a model that makes this very explicit is given in [DMR 13, section 4](#DMR13)).

More abstractly, complex conjugation of complex vecgtor bundles induces on the [[complex K-theory]] [[spectrum]] [[KU]] an involutive [[automorphism]]. $KR$ is the corresponding $\mathbb{Z}_2$-[[equivariant spectrum]], and $KR$-theory the corresponding $\mathbb{Z}_2$-[[equivariant cohomology]] theory.  In particular, the [[homotopy fixed point]] of [[KU]] under this automorphism is [[KO]]

$$
  KO \simeq (KU)^{\mathbb{Z}/2}
$$

and this way where in complex K-theory one has [[KU]]-[[modules]] ([[âˆž-modules]]), so in KR-theory one has $KO$-modules.

KR is an example of a [[real-oriented cohomology theory]], together with for instance [[MR-theory]] and [[BPR-theory]].

###### Remark on terminology

Hence $X$ here is equipped with an [[involution]] by a [[diffeomorphism]]. In this context this is often thought of as a non-linear [[real structure]] and so these spaces are called "real spaces". Following this, $KR$-theory is usually pronounced "real K-theory". But **beware** that this terminology easily conflicts with or is confused with [[KO]]-theory. For disambiguation the latter might better be called "orthogonal K-theory". But on abstract grounds maybe $KR$-theory would best be just called $\mathbb{Z}_2$-equivariant complex K-theory.
