>There are several things called "Birkhoff's theorem" in various field of mathematics and mathematical physics, and belong even to at least 2 different classical Birkhoff's. Even wikipedia has pages for more than one such theorem. To me the first which comes to mind is Birkhoff's factorization theorem, now also popular in Kreimer-Connes-Marcolli work and in connection to loop groups (cf. book by Segal and Pressley).

Some named results pertaining to [[Garrett Birkhoff]] (mainly [[algebra|algebraist]]) are

* the [[Birkhoff–von Neumann theorem]] on Birkhoff-von-Neumann algorithm for decomposing a bistochastic matrix into a convex combination of permutation matrices
* [[distributive lattice|Birkhoff Duality of distributive lattices]]
* [[Birkhoff's HSP theorem]] or [[Birkhoff's variety theorem]] in [[universal algebra]]
* [[Birkhoff's subdirect representation theorem]] in [[universal algebra]]

Named results pertaining to [[George David Birkhoff]] (mainly [[analysis|analyst]]) include

* [[Birkhoff decomposition]] (or factorization)
