## Definition 

A **Bézout domain** is an [[integral domain]] that is also a [[Bézout ring]]. 

### In constructive mathematics

In constructive mathematics, there are different types of integral domains, yielding different types of Bézout domains: the gcd function and Bézout coefficient functions are no longer valued in $R \setminus \{0\}$ in one variable, but in $\{x \in R \vert x \neq 0\}$, $\{x \in R \vert x \# 0\}$, or some other definition, depending on what the base [[integral domain]] ends up being (classical, Heyting, discrete, residue, et cetera). 

## Properties

Every Bézout domain is a [[GCD domain]]. 
\begin{proof}
Let $R$ be a Bézout domain and let $a,b \in R$. There exists $c \in R$ such that $aR+bR=cR$. We see that $c$ divides $a$ and $b$, and that for every $r \in R$, if $r$ divides $a$ and $b$, then $r$ divides $c$. Therefore, $c$ is a gcd of $a$ and $b$.
\end{proof} 

Every GCD domain of dimension at most 1 is a Bézout domain.

### Principal ideal domains

In [[classical mathematics]], every [[Bézout domain]] $R$ that satisfies one of the following conditions is a [[principal ideal domain]] in the sense that all its ideals are principal ideals:

1. $R$ is a [[unique factorization domain]]

2. $R$ is an [[atomic domain]]

3. $R$ is a [[Noetherian ring]]

4. $R$ satisfies the [[ascending chain condition on principal ideals]]. 

However, in [[constructive mathematics]], many important rings are [[Bézout domain]] satisfying all the above conditions, such as [[discrete fields]] and the [[ring of integers]], but are not [[principal ideal domains]]:

\begin{theorem}
A [[discrete field]] $K$ is a [[principal ideal domain]] if and only if the [[excluded middle|law of excluded middle]] holds. 
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
In one direction, the usual proofs rely on being able to [[decidable proposition|decide]] whether any particular element of $K$ belongs to the ideal or not. For the converse, let $\varphi$ be an arbitrary proposition. Consider the ideal $\{ x \in K | (x = 0) \vee \varphi \}$. By assumption, it is generated by the elements of $K$. Since $K$ is a [[discrete field]], it holds that $x = 0$ or $x \neq 0$. In the first case $\neg\varphi$ holds, in the second $\varphi$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
The ring of integers is a [[principal ideal domain]] if and only if the [[excluded middle|law of excluded middle]] holds.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
In one direction, the usual proofs rely on being able to [[decidable proposition|decide]] whether any particular integer belongs to the ideal or not. For the converse, let $\varphi$ be an arbitrary proposition. Consider the ideal $\{ x \in \mathbb{Z} | (x = 0) \vee \varphi \}$. By assumption, it is generated by some number $n$. Since the integers are a [[discrete integral domain]], it holds that $n = 0$ or $n \neq 0$. In the first case $\neg\varphi$ holds, in the second $\varphi$.
\end{proof}

As a result, it is common to define a principal ideal domain as a Bézout domain satisfying one of the four conditions above, to recover a concept that is identical to the usual one in classical mathematics but also includes discrete fields and $\mathbb{Z}$ in constructive mathematics. 

## Examples

* Every [[field]] $K$ is a Bézout domain where for all elements $a \in K$ and $b \in K$, $\gamma(a, b) = a \cdot b$, $\beta_1(a, b) = 1$, and $\beta_2(a, b) = 1$

* The ring of integers $\mathbb{Z}$

* For any [[discrete field]] $K$, the [[polynomial ring]] $K[x]$ on one generator is a Bézout domain. 

* The ring of [[entire function|entire]] [[holomorphic functions]] on the [[complex plane]]

### Non-examples

* For any Bézout [[unique factorization domain]] $R$, the polynomial ring $R[x]$ on one generator is a [[unique factorization domain]] which is not a Bézout domain. The ideal generated by $2$ and $x$ is not a [[principal ideal]], as $1$ is the greatest common divisor of $2$ and $x$, but $1$ is not in the ideal generated by $2$ and $x$. 

* In particular, any integral domain extension $\mathbb{R}[x, y]$ of the [[rational numbers]] by a [[transcendental number]] $x \in \mathbb{R}$is not a Bézout domain. 

* Similarly, for any [[field]] $K$, the polynomial ring $R[x, y]$ on two generators is a [[unique factorization domain]] which is not a Bézout domain. The ideal generated by $x$ and $y$ is not a [[principal ideal]], as $1$ is the greatest common divisor of $x$ and $y$, but $1$ is not in the ideal generated by $x$ and $y$. 

* In particular, any integral domain extension $\mathbb{Q}[x, y]$ of the [[rational numbers]] by two [[transcendental numbers]] $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and $y \in \mathbb{R}$ which are [[linearly independent]] as [[basis]] [[rational vector space|$\mathbb{Q}$-vectors]] is not a Bézout domain.
