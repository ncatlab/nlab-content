## Idea

Something weaker than a [[principal ideal domain]]: Not _every_ ideal is supposed to be principal, only the finitely generated ones should.

## Definition 

A **Bézout domain** is a [[GCD domain]] $R$ which satisfies **Bézout's identity**: Given elements $a \in R \backslash \{0\}$ and $b \in R \backslash \{0\}$, there exists elements $x \in R$ and $y \in R$ such that $a \cdot x + b \cdot y = \gcd(a, b)$, where $\gcd(a, b)$ is the [[greatest common divisor]] of $a$ and $b$. Or equivalently, there exist functions $\beta_0:R \backslash \{0\} \times R \backslash \{0\} \to R$ and $\beta_1:R \backslash \{0\} \times R \backslash \{0\} \to R$ such that for every element $a \in R \backslash \{0\}$ and $b \in R \backslash \{0\}$, $a \cdot \beta_0(a, b) + b \cdot \beta_1(a, b) = \gcd(a, b)$. 

Equivalently, an integral domain such that the sum of two [[principal ideals]] is also a [[principal ideal]]. 

## Properties

In [[classical mathematics]], every [[Bézout domain]] $R$ that satisfies one of the following conditions is a [[principal ideal domain]]

1. $R$ is a [[unique factorization domain]]

2. $R$ is a [[Noetherian ring]]

3. $R$ is an [[atomic domain]]

4. $R$ satisfies the ascending chain condition on principal ideals. 

## Examples

* The ring of integers $\mathbb{Z}$

* For any [[prime number]] $p$ and any [[finite field]] $\mathbb{F}_p$ of [[characteristic]] $p$, the [[polynomial ring]] $\mathbb{F}_p[x]$ on one generator

* The ring of [[entire function|entire]] [[holomorphic functions]] on the [[complex plane]]

## In constructive mathematics

In [[constructive mathematics]], Bézout domains are usually better behaved because many important rings may fail to be [[principal ideal domains]].

For instance, the ring of integers is a principal ideal domain if and only if the [[excluded middle|law of excluded middle]] holds: In one direction, the usual proofs rely on being able to [[decidable proposition|decide]] whether any particular integer belongs to the ideal or not. 

For the converse, let $\varphi$ be an arbitrary proposition. Consider the ideal $\{ x \in \mathbb{Z} | (x = 0) \vee \varphi \}$. By assumption, it is generated by some number $n$. Since the integers are [[decidable equality|discrete]], it holds that $n = 0$ or $n \neq 0$. In the first case $\neg\varphi$ holds, in the second $\varphi$.

However, this ideal cannot be proved to be finitely generated either.  If an ideal is generated by $n_1, \ldots, n_k$, then we may form their [[gcd]] one step at a time, which we can do algorithmically.  Therefore, $\mathbb{Z}$ remains a Bézout domain.
