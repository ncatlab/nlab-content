## Definition

Given a [[universe]] $U$, a **$U$-large set** is a set which is not a $U$-small set. What not being $U$-small means depends upon the [[foundations]]; in [[material set theory]], one would use the property of not being equal to any $U$-small sets, while in [[structural set theory]], one would use the property of not being in [[bijection]] with any $U$-small sets and in [[dependent type theory]], one would use the property of not being [[equivalence of types|equivalent]] to any $U$-small sets. 

A $U$-large set is sometimes also called a **[[proper class]] relative to $U$**, but here, we shall use the term **proper class** for any formula in the language of [[material set theory]] for a [[proposition]] which is not a material [[set]]. 

$U$-large sets can be contrasted with $U$-[[small sets]].
