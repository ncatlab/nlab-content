## Definition

Given a [[universe]] $U$, a **$U$-large set** is a set which is not a $U$-small set. $U$-large sets can be contrasted with $U$-[[small sets]]. 

## Relation to classes

Every [[proper class]] in [[set theory]] is a $U$-large set. However, in [[dependent type theory]], only material proper classes are always $U$-large [[h-sets]]; structural proper classes in dependent type theory are [[h-groupoids]] if the universe $U$ is a [[univalent universe]].
