### Idea ###

At its simplest, a [[smooth manifold]] is a place where one can do calculus without worries.  Let us consider the formula for a derivative:

$$
f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}
$$

From the fractional part of this, it appears that to be able to discuss calculus, we need to be working in a space which allows addition and scalar multiplication.  However, the fact that we are considering a limit means that we only need to be able to do such things in a neighbourhood of a given point.  That is, we need the concept of a _local_ addition.

Thus at its most general, a local addition at a point is simply the structure of a (piece of a) vector space near that point.  This is, of course, the notion of a [[chart]].  At this point, one starts to think about notions of compatibility between different local additions.  By concentrating on what it means for two charts to be compatible at a point, one soon arrives at the notion of an [[atlas]].

Another direction that one could take is to ask for a system of local additions, one for each point, and ask that these fit together in some nice manner as one moves over the manifold.  This leads to the notion of a **local addition**.

### Definition ###

The broadest definition is the following.

+-- {: .num_defn #locadd}
###### Definition
A **local addition** on $M$ consists of a vector bundle $\pi \colon E \to M$, an open neighbourhood of the zero section, $U \subseteq E$, and a smooth map $\eta \colon U \to M$ such that

1. The composition of $\eta$ with the zero section of $E$ is the identity on $M$, and
2. there exists an open neighbourhood, say $V$, of the diagonal in $M \times M$ such that the map $\pi \times \eta \colon U \to M \times M$ is a diffeomorphism onto $V$.
=--

###### Remarks ######

1. By considering the derivative of $\eta$, one can see that the bundle $E$ must be isomorphic to $T M$.  However, it is not necessary to specify an isomorphism in advance since $\eta$ naturally defines one.  Nonetheless, it is common simply to take $E = T M$.

2. Another way to simplify the definition is to take $U = E$.  In [KM &#167;42.4](#km), this is called a _globally defined_ local addition (though such a conjunction of "global" and "local" may grate).  Given a local addition with arbitrary $U$, it is possible to define a "globally defined" one simply by using a smooth fibrewise embedding (preserving the zero section) of $E$ onto an open subset of $U$.

3. A useful source of local additions is from Riemannian geometry: the exponential map coming from a Riemannian structure defines a local addition.

4. Another source of local additions is to apply the tubular neighbourhood theorem to the embedding of the diagonal $M \to M \times M$.

### Charts from Local Additions ###

#### Charts for $M$ ####

Local additions are used in constructing the manifold structure on certain mapping spaces.  In brief, if $M$ is a manifold (possibly infinite dimensional) admitting a local addition, and if $N$ is a compact manifold (possibly with boundary) then $C^\infty(N,M)$ can be given the structure of a smooth manifold and the construction of the charts uses the local addition on $M$.  For details, see [KM &#167;42](#km).  Applying this to the case $N = pt$, we obtain charts for $M$ itself.  These charts are useful since then we have charts on both $M$ and the various mapping spaces which are all defined using the same method and so the relationships between them are that much clearer.

###### Proposition
Let $M$ be a smooth manifold, $\eta \colon E \supseteq U \to M$ a local addition on $M$.  Let $V \subseteq M \times M$ be the image of $\pi \times \eta$.  Let $p \in M$.  Let $U_p \coloneqq E_p \cap U$ be the fibre of $U$ over $p$.  Let $V_p \subseteq M$ be such that $\{p\} \times V_p = V \cap \left(\{p\} \times M\right)$.  Then the restriction of $\eta$ to $U_p$ defines a diffeomorphism $\eta_p \colon U_p \to 
V_p$.
=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
Let us start by showing that $\eta_p$ is well-defined.  Clearly, we can restrict $\eta$ to $U_p$ to get _something_, the only question is its image.  To find that, we look at the image of $U_p$ under $\pi \times \eta$.  Since $U_p \subseteq E_p = \pi^{-1}(p)$, the image of $U_p$ is contained in $V \cap \left(\{p\} \times M\right)$, which is what we have called $V_p$.  Conversely, if $q \in V_p$ then $(p,q) \in V$ and so $(\pi \times \eta)^{-1}(p,q) \in U$.  Since $\pi(\pi \times \eta)^{-1}(p,q) = p$, we have $(\pi \times \eta)^{-1}(p,q) \in U \cap E_p$ and thus there is some $r \in U_p$ such that $\eta(r) = q$.  Hence the image of $\eta_p$ is $V_p$ as claimed.

The rest follows from the simple fact that we can also define $\eta_p$ as the restriction of the diffeomorphism $(\pi \times \eta) \colon U \to V$ to the subset $U_p$ on the source and $\{p\} \times V_p$ on the target.

#### Charts for Mapping Spaces ####

Local additions are used to great effect in constructing charts for mapping spaces.

Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with a local addition, $\eta$.  We shall assume that the domain of $\eta$ is the tangent bundle, $T M$.  Let $N$ be a functionally compact [[Fr√∂licher space]].  Let $P \subseteq M$ be a submanifold that admits a [[tubular neighbourhood]].  Let $Q \subseteq N$ be a subset.  We consider the space $C^\infty(N,M;Q,P)$ of smooth maps $N \to M$ which map $Q$ into $P$.  As a smooth manifold, $M$ naturally has the structure of a Fr&#246;licher space so this mapping space is well-defined.

### Diffeomorphisms from Local Additions ###

Another useful construction from a local addition relates to diffeomorphisms.  In differential topology, manifolds have a certain amount of "flexibility": a common picture is of a rubber sheet that can be deformed.  The amount of flexibility is less than that allowed in algebraic topology, but certainly more than that in differential geometry.  Being able to deform a manifold a little is a very useful trick in establishing the relationships between the various mapping spaces (for example, it is used in showing that the loop space fibration $\Omega M \to L M \to M$ is a [[fibre bundle]] and not just a fibration) and so it is useful to have a consistent way to perform these deformations that is compatible with a given local addition.

The aim of this construction is to produce, for each $v \in U$, a 1-parameter family of diffeomorphisms, $\phi_{(t,v)}$, such that $\phi_{(t,v)}(\pi(v)) = \eta(t v)$.  That is, the basepoint $p = \pi(v)$ is deformed along the path $\eta(t v)$ to $\eta(v)$, and the rest of the manifold is dragged along behind it.  (In actual fact, only a very small amount of the manifold is dragged along - although our manifolds are flexible, they have a high amount of tension.)

So let $\eta \colon U \to M$ be a local addition.  Let $\nu \colon U \to \mathbb{R}$ be a smooth function with the following fibrewise property: for each $r \in \mathbb{R}$, the set $\{q \in U_p : \nu(q) \le r\}$ is a compact, [[radial]] subset.  The square of the norm coming from a smooth orthogonal structure would suffice.  Let $\rho \colon \mathbb{R} \to [0,1]$ be a smooth function such that $\rho(t) = 1$ for $t \le 0$ and $\rho(t) = 0$ for $t \ge 1$.

Now for $v \in U$, we define a vector field $\hat{X}_v$ on $U_p$, where $p = \pi(v)$, by

$$
\hat{X}_v(w) \coloneqq \rho(\nu(w) - \nu(v))v
$$

Notice that if $\nu(w) \ge \nu(v) + 1$ then $\hat{X}_v(w) = 0$ whilst if $\nu(w) \le \nu(v)$ (so in particular if $w = t v$ for some $t \in [0,1]$) then $\hat{X}_v(w) = v$.  By the first of these, we see that $\hat{X}_v$ is compactly supported on $U_p$.  We can transfer it via $\eta_p$ to $V_p$ and, as it is compactly supported, extend it to all of $M$ by defining it to be $0$ outside $V_p$.  Let us write $X_v$ for this vector field.

By construction, the map $v \to X_v$ is smooth.  As $X_v$ is compactly supported, we can apply the exponentiation map $\mathcal{X}_c(M) \to Diff(M)$ and so obtain, for each $v \in U$, a 1-parameter family of diffeomorphisms of $M$, say $\phi_{(t,v)}$.  From the construction of $X_v$, it is clear that all the "action" of this family of diffeomorphisms takes place in $V_p$.  Moreover, by construction, the point $p$ moves along the line $t \mapsto \eta(t v)$ for $t \in [0,1]$.
