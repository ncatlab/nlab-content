# Idea #

In any ambient [[category]] or $\infty$-[[infinity-category|category]] $C$ that admits a notion of 
[[colimit]] or [[weak limit|weak colimit]], a _simplicial resolution_
of an object $c \in C$ is a [[simplicial object]] 
$y_\bullet : \Delta^{op} \to C$ such that it realizes $c$ as a colimit

$$
  c \simeq colim_{[k]} y_k
  \,.
$$

# Examples #

* In an [[(infinity,1)-topos]] [[Čech cover]] $C(U) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} X$
  induced by a [[cover]] $(U = \coprod_i U_i) \to X$ is a simplicial resolution of $X$.

# References #

Simplicial resolutions in the context of 
[[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presentable (infinity,1)-categories]] are discussed
in section 6.1.4 of 

* [[Jacob Lurie]], [[Higher Topos Theory]]
