## Idea

The notion of a **class-locally presentable category** is a generalisation of that of a [[locally presentable category]]: In a class-locally presentable category one may need a [[proper class]] of [[objects]] (instead of just a [[small set]]) to build all the others by suitable [[colimits]].

## Definition

Let $\lambda$ be a [[regular cardinal]], and let the [[category]] $C$ be [[complete category|complete]] and [[cocomplete category|cocomplete]]. Then $C$ is called **class $\lambda$-presentable** if there is a [[class]] $A \subset C$ of $\lambda$-presentable objects such that every object of $C$ is a $\lambda$-[[filtered colimit]] of objects in $A$. A category is class-locally presentable if it is class $\lambda$-presentable for some $\lambda$.

If $C$ merely has $\lambda$-filtered colimits, rather than all colimits (and limits), then it is called **class $\lambda$-accessible**, and **class-accessible** if it is class $\lambda$-accessible for some $\lambda$.
