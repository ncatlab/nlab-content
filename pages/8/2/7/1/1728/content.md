## Idea

A ([[prequantum field theory|pre]]-)[[quantum field theory|quantum]] [[field theory]] _with defects_ is, roughly a [[field theory]] that assigns data not just to plain [[manifolds]]/[[cobordisms]], but to spaces that may carry certain singularities and/or colorings. At the locus of such a singularity the [[bulk]] field theory may then undergo transitions.

Such defects are known by many names. In [[codimension]] 1 they are often called [[domain walls]]. If they are [[boundaries]] they are often called _[[branes]]_, the corresponding domain walls are then sometimes called [[bi-branes]]. Examples of Dimension-1 defects are [[Wilson lines]] and [[cosmic strings]] (at least in [[gauge theory]]) and dimension-0 defects are often called [[monopoles]].

## Definition

### General
 {#DefinitionGeneral}

A plain $n$-dimensional local [[FQFT]] (a [[bulk]] field theory) is a [[monoidal (∞,n)-functor|symmetric monoidal]] [[(∞,n)-functor]] from the [[(∞,n)-category of cobordisms]]. 

$$  
  Z : Bord_n \to \mathcal{C}^\otimes
  \,.
$$

If one replaces plain [[cobordisms]] here with cobordisms $Bord_n^{Def}$ "with singularities" including [[boundaries]] and [[corners]] but also partitions labeled in a certain index set $Def$, one calls a morphism

$$
  Z : Bord_n^{Def} \to \mathcal{C}
$$

a TQFT _with defects_. A general formalization is in ([Lurie 09, section 4.3](#Lurie09)), see at _[Cobordism theorem -- For cobordisms with singuarities (boundaries/branes and defects/domain walls)](cobordism+hypothesis#ForCobordismsWithSingularities)_. See also ([Davydov, Runkel & Kong 2011](#DavydovRunkelKong11) and [Carqueville-Runkel-Schaumann](#CarquevilleRunkelSchaumann)).

Such a morphism carries data as follows:

* for each label in $Def$ of codimension 0 there is an ordinary [[bulk]] field theory;

* for each label in $Def$ of codimension 1 data on how to "connect" the two TQFTs on both sides

* etc.

So one may think of the codimension $k$ colors as _defects_ where the TQFT that one is looking at changes its nature.

In particular, when the QFT on one side of the defect is trivial, then the defect behaves like a _boundary condition_ for the remaining QFT. Since at least for $n=2$ QFT such boundary conditions are also called _[[branes]]_, defects are also called _[[bi-branes]]_.

The statement of the **cobordism theorem with singularities** ([Lurie 09, theorem 4.3.11](#Lurie09)) is essentially the following: 

Given a [[symmetric monoidal (∞,n)-category]] $\mathcal{C}^\otimes$, then for every choice of [[pasting diagram]] of [[k-morphisms]] for all $k$, there is a type of manifolds with singularity $Def$, such that $Bord_n^Def$ is the free symmetric monoidal $(\infty,n)$-category on this data, hence such that TFTs with defects $(Bord_n^Def)^\otimes \to \mathcal{C}^\otimes$ are equivalently given by realizing such a pasting diagram in $\mathcal{C}$, where each of the given [[k-morphism]] appears as the value of a codimension $(n-k)$-defect. (See also [Lurie 09, remark 4.3.14](#Lurie09)).


### Topological defects from spontaneously broken symmetry
 {#DefectsFromBrokenSymmetry}

> under construction

An old notion of _defects_ in field theory -- well preceeding the [above](#DefinitionGeneral) general notion in the context of [[FQFT]] -- is that of **[[topological defects]] in the [[vacuum]] structure of [[gauge theories]] that exhibit [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] (such as a [[Higgs mechanism]]).

A comprehensive review in in ([Vilenkin-Shellard 94](#VilenkinShellard94). Steps towards conceptually systematizing these broken-symmetry defects and their interaction are made in [Preskill-Vilenkin 92](#PreskillVilenkin92). We now discuss this may be translated to and formalized in the general [[FQFT]] definition [above](#DefinitionGeneral) along the lines of ([Fiorenza-Valentino](#FiorenzaValentino), [FSS](#FSS)).

Let $G$ be a [[Lie group]], to be thought of as the (local or global) [[gauge group]] of some [[gauge theory]]. Let $H \hookrightarrow G$ a [[subgroup]], to be thought of as the subgroup of global symmetries preserved by some [[vacuum]] configuration (which "[[spontaneous symmetry breaking|spontaneously breaks]]" the symmetry from $G$ to $H$, the archetypical example is the [[Higgs mechanism]]). 

Then the space of such vacuum configurations is the [[coset]] space $G/H$. So given a [[manifold]] $X$ ([[spacetime]]), [[vacuum]] configuratons are given by [[functions]] $X \to G/H$. Hence $G/H_1$ is the "[[moduli space]] of vacua" or "vacuum space" in this context.

The functions $X \to G/H$ are to be [[smooth functions]] in the [[bulk]] of spacetime. If they are allowed to be non-smooth or even non-[[continuous function|continuous]] along given strata of $X$, then these are called **defects** in the sense of broken gauge symmetry.

In particular (with counting adapted to $dim X = 4$)

* if $X \to G/H$ is not smooth but is smooth on the pre-image of each element of $\pi_0(G/H)$ and becomes a smooth function on $X-S_1$ where $S_1 \hookrightarrow X$ is a [[codimension]]-1 [[submanifold]], then $S_1$ is said to be a [[domain wall]] for vacuum configurations.

* if $X \to G/H$ is not smooth but becomes smooth on $X-S_2$, where $S_2$ is a codimension-2 submanifold, then $S_2$ is calld a [[cosmic string]]-defect of the vacuum configurations;

* if $X \to G/H$ is not smooth but becomes smooth on $X-S_3$, where $S_3$ is a codimension-3 submanifold, then $S_3$ is calld a [[monopole]]-defect of the vacuum configurations.

> hm, need to fine-tune the technical conditions here, to make the following statement come out right...


So 

* [[domain walls]] can appear when $\pi_0(G/H)$ is non-trivial;

* [[cosmic strings]] can appear when $\pi_1(G/H)$ is non-trivial;

* [[monopoles]] can appear when $\pi_2(G/H)$ is non-trivial.


Next consider a sequence of [[subgroups]]

$$
  H_2 \hookrightarrow H_1 \hookrightarrow H_0 \coloneqq G
$$

to be thought of as coming from two consecutive steps of [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]], the first one down to $H_1$ at some [[energy]]-scale $E_1$, and the second at some lower energy scale $E_2 \lt E_1$.

Then we say that vacuum defects at energy $E_2$ of codimension-$k$ which wind around an element $\pi_k(H_1/H_2)$ are **metastable** if they become unstable at energy $E_1$, hence if their image in $\pi_k(H_0/H_2)$ is trivial.

So if we add to the singular cobordism category the $k$-morphism which is the $k$-dimenional unit cube with an open $k$-[[ball]] removed, then the boundary field data for metastable codimension $n-k$-defects is


$$
  \array{
     [0,1]^k - D^k &\to & \Pi(H_1/H_2)
     \\
     \downarrow &\swArrow& \downarrow
     \\
     [0,1]^k &\to& \Pi(H_0/H_2) &\to& \Pi(H_0/H_1)
  }
$$

we have a [[homotopy fiber sequence]]

$$
  \Pi(H_1/H_2) \to \Pi(H_0/H_2) \to \Pi(H_0/H_1)
  \,.
$$

This induces a [[long exact sequence of homotopy groups]]

$$
   \cdots \to \pi_{k+1}(H_0/H_1) \to \pi_k(H_1/H_2) \to \pi_k(H_0/H_2) \to \pi_k(H_0/H_1)
  \to 
  \pi_{k-1}(H_1/H_2) \to \cdots
  \,.
$$

So for every metastable defect of codimension $n-k$ given by $c \in ker(\pi_k(H_1/H_2) \to \pi_k(H_0/H_2))$ there is an element in $\pi_{k+1}(H_0/H_1)$ of one codimension higher. One says ([Preskill-Vilenkin 92](#PreskillVilenkin92)) that the codimenion $(n-k)$-defect may end on that codimension $(n-k-1)$-defect.

(...)

In order to formalize this we introduce, following the [[cobordism theorem]] with singularities, cells in $Span_n(\mathbf{H})$ which label spontaneous-symmetriy-breaking defects as well as their defects-of-defects which exhibit their decay by higher codimension defects.

Consider a span of the form

$$
  \array{
    [\Pi(S^{k-1}), \Pi(H_1/H_2)]
    &\leftarrow&
    [\Pi(S^{k-1}), \Pi(H_1/H_2)]
    &\rightarrow&  
    \ast
  }
  \,.
$$

Comparing this to the span that comes from the "cap" $S^{k-1} \to D^{k} \leftarrow \emptyset$ in the theory at energy level $E_2$, which is just 

$$
  \array{
    [\Pi(S^{k-1}), \Pi(H_1/H_2)]
    &\leftarrow&
    [\Pi(D^{k}), \Pi(H_1/H_2)]
    &\rightarrow&  
    \ast
  }
$$

shows that the former models a $k$-disk which is not filled with spacetime, but nevertheless closes the disk. This is the defect given as a removal of a piece of spacetime.

In order to formalize how these defects may decay at higher energy, consider next  a [[span]] of [[field (physics)|field]] configurations of the form

$$
  \array{
    [\Pi(S^{k-1}), \Pi(H_1/H_2)]
    &\leftarrow&
    [\Pi(S^{k}), \Pi(H_0/H_1)]
    &\rightarrow&  
    [\ast, \Pi(H_0/H_2)]
  }
  \,.
$$

Comparing again to the span that comes from the "cap" $S^{k-1} \to D^{k} \leftarrow \emptyset$ in the theory at energy level $E_2$, which is just 

$$
  \array{
    [\Pi(S^{k-1}), \Pi(H_1/H_2)]
    &\leftarrow&
    [\Pi(D^{k}), \Pi(H_1/H_2)]
    &\rightarrow&  
    \ast
  }
$$

shows that the former models a $k$-disk whose center point carries a singularity: the fields at the bounding $S^{k-1}$ take values in the moduli space of the ambient theory $\Pi(H_1/H_2)$, but then at the tip of the "cap" there is a "field insertion" of a field with values in $\Pi(H_0/H_2)$. Hence this labels a defect of codimension $k$.

To construct such a decay-process span that captures the above story from [Preskill-Vilenkin 92](#PreskillVilenkin92), consider the following diagram:

$$
  \array{
     && [\Pi(S^{k}), \Pi(H_0/H_1)]
     \\
     && \downarrow
     \\
     && [\Pi(S^{k-1}), \Omega\Pi(H_0/H_1)]
     \\
     & \swarrow && \searrow
     \\
     [\Pi(S^{k-1}), \Pi(H_1/H_2)] && (pb) && [\Pi(D^k), \Pi(H_0/H_2)] & \simeq & [\ast, \Pi(H_0/H_2)]
     \\
     & \searrow & & \swarrow
     \\
     && [\Pi(S^{k-1}), \Pi(H_0/H_2)]
  }
$$

This may be read as follows: 

1. on the far left $[\Pi(S^k), \Pi(H_1/H_2)]$ is the space of fields of the ambient theory at energy scale $E_2$ around the defect;

1. the bottom left map is the "fluctuation" map that sends these fields to fields at the higher energy scale $E_1$;

1. the bottom right map exhibt the possible "decays": a lift through this map takes a field configuration that winds around a $k$-ball and contracts it through that $k$-ball, hence going forth and back through the bottom two maps corresponds to carrying a defect over the energy barrier from $E_2$ to $E_1$ and there having it decay away.

1. these decaying configurations are therefore given by the [[homotopy fiber product]] of the bottom two functions, which is $[\Pi(S^{k-1}), \Omega\Pi(H_0/H_1)]$, as indicated. But this space is really given by field configurations at energy scale $E_1$ that wind around a $(k+1)$-ball, as shown at the very top.

Hence the top part of this diagram is a span that exhibits a defect-of-defects which tells just the story that ([Preskill-Vilenkin 92](#PreskillVilenkin92)) is telling: a codimension-$k$ defect of the low energy theory decays at higher energy, and the decay is witnessed by the appearance of a codimension $(k+1)$-defect of the high energy theory.

$$
  \array{
     && {high\;energy \atop codim-(k+1)\;defects}
     \\
     && \downarrow
     \\
     && {low\;energy\;codim-k\;defects \atop with\;their\;decay\;processes}
     \\
     & \swarrow && \searrow
     \\
     {low\;energy \atop codim-k\;defects} && (pb) && {high\;energy \atop decay\;processes}
     \\
     & {}_{\mathllap{tunnel}}\searrow & & \swarrow_{\mathrlap{apply}}
     \\
     && {codim-k\;defects \atop raised\;to\;higher\;energy}
  }
$$
