## Idea

Traditional [[DHR superselection theory]] considers charges localized in compact regions. One can also generalize DHR theory to the case of representations localized on neighbourhoods of semi-infinite rays. This is now usually going by the term "string localization" (though there is no known relation to [[string theory|other uses]] of the word "string" in physics, except maybe the suggestion ([Buchholz-Fredenhagen 82](#BuchholzFredenhagen)), that one can understand these rays as reflecting [[flux tubes]] between two charged particles).
