## Idea
Classical [[Galois theory]] is about the classification of intermediate field extensions in a (field-theoretic) [[algebraic closure]] of a ground field according to the structure of a [[profinite group|profinite automorphism group]].

This can be adapted to the setting of a [[universal domain|monster model]] of any [[first-order theory]] which [[elimination of imaginaries|eliminates imaginaries]]: we can analogously classify [[definable closure|definably closed]] subsets of a [[definable closure|model-theoretic algebraic closure]] of some parameter set according to the structure of a profinite automorphism group.

In the language of [[Grothendieck's Galois theory]], we can sketch the next two sections as: the category of finite $A$-definable sets in a [[monster model]] $\mathbb{M}$ equipped with the forgetful functor to [[Set]] is a [[Galois category]].

## The case of finite extensions
It will be instructive to look at the case of finite extensions first, as the case of infinite extensions will be a version of the same argument but souped-up with formalities about profinite groups.

Recall the [[fundamental theorem of Galois theory]] for finite extensions of fields:

**Theorem.** For $L/K$ a finite, [[separable field extension|separable]], [[normal field extension]], there is an order-reversing bijective correspondence

$$\operatorname{Sub}_{\mathbf{Grp}} \large( \operatorname{Aut}(L/K)\large) \leftrightarrows \operatorname{Int} \large(L/K\large)$$

between the subgroups of the group of field automorphisms of $L$ fixing $K$ pointwise, and the intermediate field extensions between $K$ and $L$. The correspondence is given by sending a subgroup to its field of fixed points, and an intermediate extension to its stabilizer subgroup.

This can be translated to general model-theoretic language as follows: we work in a monster model $\mathbb{M} \models T$ for a complete first-order theory which [[elimination of imaginaries|eliminates imaginaries]]. Let $A$ be a small parameter set in $M$. We have the following

**Dictionary**, between our general $T$ eliminating imaginaries and the special case $T = [[ACF]]$ the theory of an algebraically closed field.

- $A \supseteq K$ corresponds to "$A$ is an extension of $K$".
- If $A$ is an extension of $K$, the  [[definable closure]] of $A$ corresponds to the [[perfect field|perfect hull]] of the field $K(A)$ generated by adjoining $A$.
- If $A$ is an extension of $K$, the  [[algebraic closure]] of $A$ corresponds to the separable closure of the field $K(A)$ generated by adjoining $A$.
- If $A$ is a definably closed extension of $K$ with $A = \operatorname{dcl}(\gamma \cup K)$ for $\gamma$ finite, this corresponds to $K(A)$ being finitely-generated.
- The [[orbit]] of an element $\ell \in \mathbb{M}$ under $\Aut(\mathbb{M}/K)$ corresponds to conjugates of $\ell$ in $K(\ell)$ under $\operatorname{Aut}(K(\ell)/K)$.
- The size of this orbit corresponds to the degree of the field extensions $K(\ell)/K$.
- If this orbit is finite, $\ell$ is said to be _algebraic_ over $K$.
- The condition "$\forall \ell \in L \supseteq K$, $\operatorname{Orb}_{\operatorname{Aut}(\mathbb{M}/L)}(\ell) \subseteq L$" corresponds to "$L$ is a normal extension of $K$".

When $L$ is a normal extension of $K$, $L$ splits into $\operatorname{Aut}(\mathbb{M}/K)$-orbits, and so the latter group acts via restriction on $L/K$. We call the image of the induced group homomorphism $\operatorname{Aut}(\mathbb{M}/K) \to \Sym(L/K)$ $\operatorname{Aut}(L/K)$.

With this in place, we can show:

**Theorem.** Let $K$ be a definably closed parameter set. Let $A$ be a normal extension of $K$ generated by the finite algebraic tuple $\gamma$. Then there is an order-reversing bijective correspondence between the subgroups of $\operatorname{Aut}(A/K)$ and the definably closed intermediate extensions of $A/K$. The correspondence is given by maps $\mathsf{Fix}$ sending a subgroup to its fixed points and $\mathsf{Stab}$ sending an intermediate definably closed extension to its stabilizer subgroup.

_Proof._ By saturation, $\mathsf{Fix}$ is well-defined, and $\mathsf{Stab}$ is clearly well-defined.

$\mathsf{Fix}$ is left-[[inverse]] to $\mathsf{Stab}$: by saturation in the [[monster model|monster]], any fixed points of $\mathsf{Stab}(B)$ for $K \subseteq B \subseteq A$ must be in the definable closure of $B$, so whenever $B$ is definably closed, $\mathsf{Fix} \left( \mathsf{Stab} (B) \right) \subseteq B$, with the reverse inclusion immediate.

$\mathsf{Stab}$ is left-inverse to $\mathsf{Fix}$: for $H$ a subgroup of $\operatorname{Aut}(A/K)$, note that for any $c$ a [[elimination of imaginaries|code]] for the $H$-orbit of $\gamma$ and for any $\sigma \in \operatorname{Aut}(\mathbb{M}/K)$, $\sigma$ fixes $c$ if and only if the restriction $\sigma \restriction A$ permutes $H.\gamma$. Since $\gamma$ generates $A$, any automorphism in $\operatorname{Aut}(A/K)$ is determined by where it sends $\gamma$, so $\sigma \restriction A \operatorname{.} \gamma \in H.\gamma \iff \sigma \restriction A \in H$.

In particular, since $H.\gamma$ is finite, $c$ is actually $H.\gamma$-definable, hence $A$-definable. Since $A$ is definably closed, $c \in A$, and so $c \in \mathsf{Fix}(H)$. If $g \in \mathsf{Stab}(\mathsf{Fix}(H))$, $g$ in particular fixes $c$, hence $g \in H$, and it's clear that $H \subseteq \mathsf{Stab}(\mathsf{Fix}(H))$. $\square$



## Classifying intermediate extensions inside a model-theoretic algebraic closure
We'll get the case for infinite extensions by just classifying everything at once.

### The model-theoretic absolute Galois group 
Let $\mathbb{M} \models T$ be a [[monster model]]. Let $A$ be a small parameter set. $\operatorname{acl}(A)$ is a normal extension of $A$, because every finite $A$-definable set splits into $\operatorname{Aut}(\mathbb{M}/A)$-orbits. The _absolute Galois group_ $\operatorname{Gal}(A)$ of $A$ is $\operatorname{Aut}(\operatorname{acl}(A)/\operatorname{dcl}(A)$.

(For example, in $\mathsf{ACF}$, this recovers the usual absolute Galois group.)

Now, $\operatorname{acl}(A)$ is the colimit of the diagram of finite $A$-definable sets. From [[commutativity of limits and colimits]], we know that whenever $F : \mathbf{C} \to G \text{-} \mathbf{Set}$ is a cofiltered diagram of $G$-sets, then taking orbits of $\underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}$ commutes with $F$. Dually, if we take automorphism groups, we get:

$$ \operatorname{Aut}\left(\underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}\right) \simeq \underset{\longleftarrow \left(F(c) \right).$$

So, $\operatorname{Gal}(A)$ is profinite.


## Examples
If $T = \mathsf{ACF}$ the [[theory of algebraically closed fields]], this recovers the classical fundamental theorem of Galois theory (at least in characteristic zero, since in $\mathsf{ACF}$ there is no way to talk about separability.

If $T = \mathsf{DCF}$ the [[theory of differentially closed fields]], this recovers [[differential Galois theory]]. (In fact, Kolchin's work was what inspired Poizat to introduce imaginaries and work out classical Galois theory in a model-theoretic setting.)

Any theory $T$ can be conservatively interpreted inside a theory $T^{\operatorname{eq}}$ which eliminates imaginaries and hence "admits a Galois theory." This is the [[coherent logic|coherent]] special case of a result Olivia Caramello spells out in very general terms in her monograph on topological (toposic) Galois theory.
