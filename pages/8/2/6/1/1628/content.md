A **local homeomorphism**  is a [[morphism]] $p : E \to B$ in the [[category]] [[Top]] of [[topological space]]s and continuous maps betweem them

* such that every $e\in E$, there is an open neighborhood $U\ni e$ such that $p(U)$ is open in $B$ and the restriction $p|_{p(U)}:U\to p(U)$ is a [[homeomorphism]].
