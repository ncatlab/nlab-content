* [[Egbert Rijke]], 

  _Introduction to Homotopy Type Theory_,

  Cambridge Studies in Advanced Mathematics,

  Cambridge University Press 

which introduces [[homotopy type theory]] in general and [[Martin-Löf dependent type theory]], the [[Univalent Foundations for Mathematics]] and [[synthetic homotopy theory]] in particular. The book is based on a course taught by Egbert Rijke at Carnegie Mellon University in the spring semester of 2018, and is expected to be published in 2021.

## Contents

The book contains three chapters:

1. The first chapter introduces the reader to [[Martin-Löf's dependent type theory]]. The fundamental concepts of [[type theory]] are explained without immediately jumping into the [[homotopy theory|homotopy]] [[relation between type theory and category theory|interpretation]] of type theory.

2. The second chapter is an exposition of [[Vladimir Voevodsky|Voevodsky]]'s [[Univalent Foundations for Mathematics]]. In this chapter we gradually extend [[dependent type theory]] with [[function extensionality]], [[propositional truncation]], the [[univalence axiom]], and the type theoretic [[replacement axiom]].

3. The third chapter studies [[higher inductive types]], and develops [[homotopy theory]] and concepts from [[higher category theory]] in type theory.

## Formalization

* The [main formalization](https://github.com/HoTT-Intro/Agda) of the book is in [[Agda]].

* Parts of the book have also been formalized in [Coq](https://github.com/HoTT-Intro/Coq).
