## Definition

A **copresheaf**, or **covariant presheaf**, on a [[category]] $C$ is a [[presheaf]] on the [[opposite category]] $C^{op}$. 

In other words, a copresheaf on $C$ is just a [[functor]] $C \to Set$. One speaks of functors as copresheaves if one wants to impose a gluing condition on them and pass to _[[cosheaves]]_.
