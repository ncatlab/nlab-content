## Definition

A **copresheaf**, or **covariant presheaf**, on a [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$ is a [[presheaf]] on the [[opposite category]] $C^{op}$. As with [[presheaves]], it is understood by default that they take values in [[Set]], but one may consider copresheaves with values in any [[category]] $\mathcal{D}$.

This is a [[concept with an attitude]]: a copresheaf on $\mathcal{C}$ is just a [[functor]] $\mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ (typically: $\mathcal{C} \to Set$, but one may speak of functors as copresheaves if eventually one wants to impose a gluing condition on them and pass to _[[cosheaves]]_.

Accordingly, the *category of copresheaves* on $\mathcal{C}$ (and with values in $\mathcal{D}$) is just the [[functor category]] $Func(\mathcal{C},\, \mathcal{D})$, whose [[morphisms]] are the [[natural transformations]]. 

For $\mathcal{D} = Set$, the [[opposite category|opposite]] of the category of copresheaves on $\mathcal{C}$ may be understood as the [[free completion]] of $\mathcal{C}$.
