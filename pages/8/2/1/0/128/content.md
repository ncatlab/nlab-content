By definition, the 0-category (i.e.: the set) of _(-1)-categories_ is the set of truth values
$$
  (-1)Cat := \{true, false\}
  \,.
$$
This naturally comes equipped with the monoidal structure $\otimes := AND$ induced from the logical AND operation.

The notion of (-1)-categories was introduced by [[Jim Dolan]] and [[Toby Bartels]] in order to complete the [[periodic table of n-categories]]. For an account see [page 11](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/math/pdf/0608/0608420v2.pdf#page=11) of 

* John C. Baez, Michael Shulman, _Lectures on $n$-Categories and Cohomology_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.CT/0608420)).

The point of having a notion of (-1)-categories is that it makes some patterns come out nicely. For instance 0-categories, i.e.: sets, are categories [[enriched category theory|enriched in]] (-1)-categories. More generally,
categories [[enriched category theory|enriched]] in (-1)-categories are [[poset|posets]] (see [p. 34](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/math/pdf/0608/0608420v2.pdf#page=34)).
