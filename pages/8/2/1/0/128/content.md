A _(-1)-category_ is a truth value.  A [[0-category]] is a set.  So, by definition, the 0-category of (-1)-categories is the set of truth values
$$
  (-1)Cat := \{true, false\}
  \,.
$$
This naturally comes equipped with the monoidal structure $\otimes := AND$ induced from the logical AND operation.

For an introduction to (-1)-categories and [[(-2)-category|(-2)-categories]] see [page 11](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/math/pdf/0608/0608420v2.pdf#page=11) of 

* John C. Baez, Michael Shulman, _Lectures on $n$-Categories and Cohomology_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.CT/0608420)).

The point of (-1)-categories is that they complete some patterns in the [[periodic table of n-categories]].  For instance [[0-category|0-categories]], i.e. sets, are examples of categories [[enriched category theory|enriched in]] (-1)-categories.  More generally, categories [[enriched category theory|enriched]] in (-1)-categories are [[poset|posets]] (see [p. 34](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/math/pdf/0608/0608420v2.pdf#page=34) in the above reference).

(-1)-categories and (-2)-categories were discovered by [[James Dolan]] and [[Toby Bartels]].  To witness these concepts in the process of being discovered, read the discussion here:
