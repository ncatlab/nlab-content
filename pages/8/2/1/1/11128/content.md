## Definition

In the generality of [[higher algebra]]:

+-- {: .num_defn #Modperf}
###### Definition

Let $R$ be an [[A-∞ ring]]. Write $R Mod^{perf} \hookrightarrow R Mod$ for the smallest [[stable (∞,1)-category]] inside that of all [[∞-modules]]  which contains $R$ and is closed under [[retracts]]. An object in $R Mod$ is called a _perfect $R$-module_ .

## Properties

### Relation to compact and dualizable objects

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Propositon

Let $R$ be an [[A-∞ ring]]. The [[(∞,1)-category of ∞-modules]] $R Mod$ is a [[compactly generated (∞,1)-category]] and the [[compact object in an (∞,1)-category|compact objects]] coincide with the perfect modules, def. \ref{Modperf}

If $R$ is commutative ([[E-∞ ring|E-∞]]) then the perfect modules (and hence the compact objects) also coincide with the [[dualizable objects]].

=--

The first statement is ([[Higher Algebra|HA, prop. 8.2.5.2]]), the second ([[Higher Algebra|HA, prop. 8.2.5.4]]). For [[perfect chain complexes]] this also appears as ([BFN 08, lemma 3.5](#BFN08)).
