## $(\infty,1)$-Category of commutative monoids

### Definition

For $C$ a [[symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category]] write $CMon(C)$ for the $(\infty,1)$-category of commutative monoids in $C$.

### Properties

+-- {: .un_theorem }
###### Theorem

* $CMon(C)$ has all [[(∞,1)-coproduct]]s and these are computed as [[tensor product]]s in $C$.

* For $K$ a _[[sifted (infinity,1)-category]]_ , [[(∞,1)-colimits]] of shape $K$ exist in $CMon(C)$ and are computed in $C$ if $K$-colimits exist in $C$ are preserved by tensor product with any object.

* $CMon(C)$ has all [[(∞,1)-limit]]s and these are computed in $C$.

=--

This is ([Lurie, section 4](#Lurie)).

###### Corollary

$(\infty,1)$-Colimits over simplicial diagrams exists in $CMon(C)$ and are computed in $C$ if they exist in $C$ and a preserved by tensor products.

=--

Because the [[simplex category]] is a [[sifted (infinity,1)-category]] (as discussed there).
