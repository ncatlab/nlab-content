## Idea

The notion of _commutative monoid_ (or _commutative monoid object_, _commutative algebra_, _commutative algebra object_) in a [[symmetric monoidal (infinity,1)-category]] is the [[(infinity,1)-category theory|(infinity,1)-categorical]] generalization of the notion of [[commutative monoid in a symmetric monoidal category]].
It is the commutative version of [[monoid in a monoidal (infinity,1)-category]].

Note that _commutative_ here really means $E_\infty$, in the sense of [[E-infinity operad]].

## Definition

A **commutative monoid** in a [[symmetric monoidal (infinity,1)-category]] $C$ is a lax symmetric monoidal $(\infty,1)$-functor

$$
  * \to C
  \,.
$$

In more detail, this means the following:

###### Definition

Given a [[symmetric monoidal (infinity,1)-category]] in its [[quasi-category|quasi-categorical]] incarnation as a coCartesian fibration of [[simplicial set]]s

$$
  p : C^\otimes \to N(FinSet_*)
$$

a **commutative monoid** in $C$ is a [[section]]

$$
  A : N(FinSet_*) \to C^\otimes
$$

such that $A$ carries collapsing morphisms in $FinSet_*$ to coCartesian morphisms in $C^\otimes$.

## $(\infty,1)$-Category of commutative monoids

### Definition

For $C$ a [[symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category]] write $CMon(C)$ for the $(\infty,1)$-category of commutative monoids in $C$.

### Properties

+-- {: .num_theorem #LimitsInCRing}
###### Theorem

* $CMon(C)$ has all [[(∞,1)-coproduct]]s and these are computed as [[tensor product]]s in $C$.

* For $K$ a _[[sifted (infinity,1)-category]]_ , [[(∞,1)-colimits]] of shape $K$ exist in $CMon(C)$ and are computed in $C$ if $K$-colimits exist in $C$ are preserved by tensor product with any object.

* $CMon(C)$ has all [[(∞,1)-limit]]s and these are computed in $C$.

This is ([Lurie DAG III, section 4](#LurieDAG3)) or ([Lurie HA, sections 3.2.2 and 3.2.3](#LurieHA)).

###### Corollary

$(\infty,1)$-Colimits over simplicial diagrams exists in $CMon(C)$ and are computed in $C$ if they exist in $C$ and a preserved by tensor products.

=--

Because the [[simplex category]] is a [[sifted (infinity,1)-category]] (as discussed there).

## Examples

* A commutative monoid in [[∞Grpd]] is an [[E-∞ space]].

* A commutative monoid in the [[stable (infinity,1)-category of spectra]] is a [[commutative ring spectrum]] or [[E-infinity ring]].
