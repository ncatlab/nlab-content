## Idea

Similar to how the [[interval type]] is the abstract [[homotopy type]] for the [[unit interval]] and the [[circle type]] is the abstract [[homotopy type]] for the [[unit circle]], the line type is the abstract [[homotopy type]] for the [[real line]]. 

## Definition

The **line type** $A^1$ is the [[higher inductive type]] generated by 

* an element $0:A^1$

* an [[equivalence of types]] $s:A^1 \simeq A^1$

* an identification $p:0 =_{A^1} s(0)$

Equivalently, it is the higher inductive type generated by 

* an element $0:A^1$

* an [[equivalence of types]] $s:A^1 \simeq A^1$

* for each $x:A^1$, an identification $p(x):x =_{A^1} s(x)$

Equivalently, it is the higher inductive type generated by 

* a function $c:\mathbb{Z} \to A^1$

* for each $z:\mathbb{Z}$, an identification $p(z):c(z) =_{A^1} c(s(z))$

where $\mathbb{Z}$ is the [[integers type]].

## Properties

### Relation to the integers

The line type is equivalent to the [[propositional truncation]] of the [[integers type]]. 

### Relation to the circle type

The [[circle type]] $S^1$ is the [[coequalizer type]] of the pair of functions on the line type

$$
A^1\underoverset{\quad s \quad}{\mathrm{id}_{A^1}}{\rightrightarrows}A^1 \to S^1
$$

This is the analogue in [[synthetic homotopy theory]] of the fact that the unit circle is the coequalizer of the pair of functions on the [[real line]] in [[classical homotopy theory]]:

$$
\mathbb{R} \underoverset{\quad (-) + 1 \quad}{\mathrm{id}_\mathbb{R}}{\rightrightarrows}\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{S}^1
$$

### Relation to the real numbers

In [[real-cohesive homotopy type theory]], the [[shape]] of the [[real numbers]] is equivalent to the line type $\esh(\mathbb{R}) \simeq A^1$.
