## Idea

According to [[???]] (English translation following [[Xiao-Gang Wen]] [here](http://physics.stackexchange.com/a/94612/5603)):

> The nameless nonbeing is the origin of universe;

> The named being is the mother of all observed things.

> Within nonbeing, we enjoy the mystery of the universe.

> Among being, we observe the richness of the world.

> Nonbeing and being are two aspects of the same mystery.

> From nonbeing to being and from being to nonbeing is the gateway to all understanding.

Rather similarly, according to ([Hegel 12](#Hegel12)) _pure being_ is the [[unity of opposites|opposite]] of [[nothing]] whose unity is pure [[becoming]]. 

| |  | [[Dasein]] | |  |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| [[becoming]] : | [[nothing]] | $\;\;\;\dashv$ | [[being]] | : [[ceasing]] |

According to the formalization of this proposed by ([Lawvere 91](#Lawvere91)), this is described by the [[adjoint modality]]

$$
  (\emptyset \dashv \ast)
$$

of the [[idempotent monad]] constant on a [[terminal object]] $\ast$ and its [[left adjoint]] $\emptyset$.

In this interpretation any other [[adjoint modality]] of the form $(\Box \dashv \bigcirc)$ characterizes a more "determinate" form of being ( _Dasein_ in the terminology of ([Hegel 12](#Hegel12))).

A [[category]] equipped with such a notion of being is, naturally, called a _[[category of being]]_.
