###### Definition

A [[locally compact topological space|locally compact]] [[topological group]] $G$ is called **[[almost connected topological group|almost connected]]** if the underlying [[topological space]] of the [[quotient]] topological group $G/G_0$ (of $G$ by the [[connected component]] of the neutral element, also called the [[identity component]]) is [[compact topological space|compact]].

=--

See for instance ([Hofmann-Morris, def. 4.24](#HofmannMorris)). We remark that since the identity component $G_0$ is closed, the identity in $G/G_0$ is a closed point. It follows that $G/G_0$ is $T_1$ and therefore, because it is a uniform space, $T_{3 \frac1{2}}$ (a [[Tychonoff space]]; see [[uniform space]] for details). In particular, $G/G_0$ is compact Hausdorff.

###### Example

Every [[compact topological space|compact]] and every [[connected topological space|connected]] [[topological group]] is almost connected.

Also every [[quotient]] of an almost connected group is almost connected.
