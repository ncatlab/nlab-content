A set equipped with an __apartness relation__ is an [[enriched category]] over the [[monoidal category]] of $(-1)$-[[(-1)-category|categories]] under the [[coproduct]]. By the law of [[excluded middle]], this is equivalent to the same set with an [[equivalence relation]] (which is a category enriched over the monoidal category of $(-1)$-categories under the *[[product]]*). But in constructive mathematics, it is a richer concept with a topological flavour.
