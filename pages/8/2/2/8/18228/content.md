## Idea

*Descriptive set theory* is the study of the structures and hierarchies of [[subsets]] of [[real numbers]] (or more generally of subsets of [[Polish spaces]]) that are definable by [[formulas]] with [[real number|real]] parameters in [[second-order arithmetic]]. 

Such subsets include [[Borel sets]] and more generally [[projective sets]] that are defined by alternating between taking [[images]] under [[projection]] maps of previously defined sets and taking [[complements]] of previously defined sets. Once the domain of topologists of the Polish schools and Russian analysts of the early 20th century, descriptive set theory is now considered a central area of logic in which [[set theory]] and [[computability theory]] ([[recursion theory]]) meet and interact.
