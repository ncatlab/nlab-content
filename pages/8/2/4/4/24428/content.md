## Idea

This is a theorem due to [[Thomas Fox]] which characterizes products in a [[cartesian monoidal category]] as an algebraic structure given by natural transformations rather than in terms of a universal poperty.

## Theorem

A [[symmetric monoidal category]] is cartesian if and only if it is [[isomorphic]] to its own category of cocommutative [[comonoids]]. Thus every object is equipped with a unique cocommutative comonoid structure, and these structures are respected by all maps.
