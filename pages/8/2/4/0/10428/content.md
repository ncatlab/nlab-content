##General Idea

**Coordination** concerns the relationship between scientific theory and empirical data. A physical theory, written say as a set of equations, does not by itself allow the formation of predictions. In addition we need some way of mediating between this theory and what our instruments can detect about the universe. For example, to connect Einstein's equations about the curvature of space-time to predicted observations of the direction of light coming from distant stars and passing close to the sun, general relativity postulates that light follows a null geodesic. 

##History

The term *coordination* itself, or rather the German *Zuordnung*, is due to Moritz Schlick who proposed a simple set-theoretic mapping between terms of a mathematically defined physical theory and given elements of sensation. Hans Reichenbach, by contrast, argued that the act of coordination was no mere mapping, but itself played a constitutive role in defining objects of knowledge.
 
A central issue between these accounts is that the more you press on the constitutive function of coordinating principles, the more it seems that the entities referred to by physics owe their characteristics to our conceptual framing rather than to how things are in themselves.

Something to do with Bohr toposes...
