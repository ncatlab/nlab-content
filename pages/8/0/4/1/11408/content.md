## Idea

The _L&#246;wenheim-Skolem theorem_ is a basic result in the _[[model theory]]_ of [[first-order logic]] and is part of a family of closely related theorems that concern the relation between structures or [[models]] of [[first-order theories]] of different cardinality. 

Historically, the theorem was one of the first results in model theory with papers published by L&#246;wenheim (1912) and Skolem (1920) which helped establishing first-order logic in the center of [[mathematical logic]].

Although the theorem fails in [[second-order logic]], variants hold in infinitary logic with countably infinite disjunctions and in [[categorical logic]] for [[sketches]]. The theorem plays an important role in [[abstract model theory]] e.g. in [[Lindström's theorems]] on the characterization of standard [[first-order logic]].[^fine]

[^fine]: As a theorem that fails to hold is hardly a theorem at all, one prefers in the context of abstract model theory to speak of the _L&#246;wenheim-Skolem property_.
