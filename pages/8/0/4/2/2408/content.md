**Vladimir Drinfel'd** (Russian: &#1042;&#1083;&#1072;&#1076;&#1080;&#1084;&#1080;&#1088; &#1043;&#1077;&#1088;&#1096;&#1086;&#1085;&#1086;&#1074;&#1080;&#1095; &#1044;&#1088;&#1080;&#1085;&#1092;&#1077;&#1083;&#1100;&#1076;, Ukrainian: &#1042;&#1086;&#1083;&#1086;&#1076;&#1080;&#1084;&#1080;&#1088; &#1043;&#1077;&#1088;&#1096;&#1086;&#1085;&#1086;&#1074;&#1080;&#1095; &#1044;&#1088;&#1110;&#1085;&#1092;&#1077;&#1083;&#1100;&#1076;) is an Ukrainian-born (Feb 4, 1954) mathematician, recipient of Fields Medal (1990), now a professor at the University of Chicago. He was student of [[Yuri Manin]] at Moscow; his main specialty is algebraic geometry, including applications to arithmetic, [[automorphic form]]s, [[representation theory]] and mathematical physics. His famous discoveries and new concepts Drinfel'd modular varieties, Drinfel'd shtukas (Drinfel'd elliptic modules), ADHM-construction of instantons, Drinfel'd-Sokolov reduction in the theory of integrable systems, algebraic approach to quantum inverse scattering method in [[integrable systems]], and related subject of quantum groups including Yangians and quasi-Hopf algebras, geometric Langlands program, chiral algebras (with A. Beilinson), certain category of infinite-dimensional bundles in algebraic geometry (now sometimes called Drinfel'd bundles), and the general construction of quotient [[dg-categories]] in [[homological algebra]]. His ideas also influenced the beginnings of the new subject of [[derived algebraic geometry]].
