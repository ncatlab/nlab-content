## Idea

A **combinatorial map** (or **algebraic map**) is a representation of a [[topological map]] (i.e., a graph embedded in a surface) as a finite set and a list of permutations acting on that set.  The precise formulation depends upon assumptions made about the underlying surface (e.g., whether it is [[connected space|connected]] and/or [[oriented]]) and about the underlying graph (e.g., whether all vertices have a fixed degree), but typically different classes of topological maps can be represented by a list of permutations satisfying different sets of constraints.

## Oriented maps

An **oriented combinatorial map** is a set $D$ equipped with a triple of [[permutations]] $(\sigma,\alpha,\phi)$ on $D$ such that:

1. the [[subgroup]] $\langle \sigma,\alpha,\phi\rangle$ of $End(D)$ generated by the permutations acts [[transitive action|transitively]] on $D$;

1. the composition of the permutations is the identity: $\phi\alpha\sigma = id$;

1. $\alpha$ is a [[fixed point]]-free [[involution]].

The elements of $D$ are referred to as _darts_.  Oriented combinatorial maps are considered up to conjugation by a bijection of the underlying set of darts, in other words, two maps $M = (D,(\sigma,\alpha,\phi))$ and $M' = (D',(\sigma',\alpha',\phi'))$ are equivalent $M \equiv M'$ if there is a bijection $h : D \cong D'$ such that $\sigma = h^{-1}\sigma' h$, $\alpha = h^{-1}\alpha' h$, $\phi = h^{-1}\phi' h$.

In the literature, oriented combinatorial maps are often simply referred to as "combinatorial maps".  Also, many authors equivalently define an oriented combinatorial map as a pair $(\sigma,\alpha)$ of permutations such that $\langle \sigma,\alpha\rangle$ acts transitively on $D$ and $\alpha$ is a fixed point-free involution.  By condition (2) above, the third permutation $\phi$ can always be recovered as $\phi = \sigma^{-1}\alpha^{-1}$.

### Representation of an oriented topological map

Let $M$ be a [[topological map]], i.e., an embedding $\theta$ of a [[graph]] $G$ into a [[surface]] $X$, and assume moreover that $X$ is [[compact]], [[connected]], [[oriented]], and without [[boundary]].  We can represent $M$ by a unique oriented combinatorial map, defined as follows (letting $E$ and $V$ stand for the set of edges and vertices, respectively, of the graph $G$):

* $D$ is defined as a set with $2n$ elements, where $n = |E|$.

* each edge $e \in E$ is associated with a pair of darts $e^+,e^- \in D$, which may be visualized either as oriented edges, or alternatively as half-edges (or in a number of different ways).  By this association, the collection of edges $E$ induces a fixed point-free involution $\alpha$ on $D$, which swaps $e^+$ with $e^-$ for each edge $e \in E$.

* suppose darts are visualized as oriented edges: we will say that a dart is _incident_ to a vertex if it has that vertex as source.  Then every vertex $x\in V$ determines a cyclic ordering of the darts incident to $x$, by considering (say) a counterclockwise-oriented [[loop]] around $\theta(x)$.  In this way (which relies on the assumption that $X$ is oriented), each vertex determines a cycle of the permutation $\sigma$.

* the cycles of the permutation $\phi = \sigma^{-1}\alpha^{-1}$ give, for each face $f$ of $M$, an ordering of darts on the boundary of that face.  With the above convention for vertices, it is easy to check that $\phi$ computes the counterclockwise cycle of darts having $f$ to the _left_.

(Note bene: the choice of Greek letters for the three permutations comes from the French words _sommet_ (vertex), _ar&#234;te_ (edge), _face_.)

### Genus

By the previous construction, it is natural to define the **genus** of an oriented combinatorial map $M = (\sigma,\alpha,\phi)$ using the [[Euler characteristic|Euler-Poincar√© formula]],

$$\chi(M) = c(\sigma) - c(\alpha) + c(\phi) = 2-2g$$

where $c(\pi)$ counts the number of cycles in the cyclic decomposition of $\pi$.

## Oriented hypermaps

If one drops condition (3) in the definition of oriented combinatorial map (i.e., the requirement that $\alpha$ be a fixed point-free involution), what remains is a natural generalization called an **oriented combinatorial hypermap** (or simply "combinatorial hypermap" or "hypermap").  It turns out that hypermaps provide a way of representing [[bipartite]] graphs embedded on oriented surfaces (including so-called [[dessins d'enfant]]), where the vertices of the graph are alternately colored in black and white.  Any topological map with all black vertices can be turned into a bi-colored one by adding white vertices in the middle of every edge (this goes well with the view of darts as half-edges), and from that perspective, hypermaps simply correspond to lifting the restriction that white vertices have degree 2.
