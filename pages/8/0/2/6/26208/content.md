## Idea

**Weak type theory** or **propositional type theory** is a [[dependent type theory]] without judgmental conversion; all the [[computation rules]]/[[beta-conversion|$\beta$-conversion rules]] and [[uniqueness rules]]/[[eta-conversion|$\eta$-conversion rules]] for types use [[identity types]] instead of [[judgmental equality]]. As a result, the results in weak type theory are more general than in models which use judgmental equality for computational and uniqueness rules, since judgmental equality implies typal equality, while the converse isn't necessarily the case. 

Formally, weak type theories come into two general versions:

* Dependent type theories which do not have judgmental equality and its [[structural rules]]. Instead, [[definitions]] of [[types]] and [[terms]] are made using [[identifications]] or [[equivalences of types]]. See [[objective type theory]] for more details on this. 

* Dependent type theories which do have judgmental equality and its [[structural rules]], and thus definitions of [[types]] and [[terms]] are still made using [[judgmental equality]]. However, in addition to the [[congruence rules]] for [[judgmental equality]] for the [[formation rules]], [[introduction rules]], and [[elimination rules]] of each type former, there are additional [[congruence rules]] for the computation and uniqueness rules, since the conversion rules are represented by the structure of an identification rather than judgmental equality, and thus this structure has to be preserved across judgmental equality. 

The latter includes weak versions of [[Martin-Löf type theory]], [[cubical type theory]], and [[observational type theory]], as well as extensions thereof such as [[type theory with shapes]] and [[simplicial type theory]]. Hypothetically, the latter would also be seen in [[proof assistants]], where the base [[programming language]] used to implement the weak type theory, such as [[Coq]] or [[Agda]], already has a judgmental equality. 

A hybrid of weak and non-weak type theories can occur in [[two-level type theory]] and variants thereof like [[Homotopy Type System]], where one level has weak types and the other one has strict types. 

## Open problems

There are plenty of questions which are currently unresolved in weak type theory. Van der Berg and Besten listed the following problems in the context of [[objective type theory]], but equally this applies to any weak type theory:

* Does [[univalence]] imply [[function extensionality]] for types in the universe in [[weak type theory]]?

* Is (the [[homotopy type theory]] based upon) [[Martin-Löf type theory]] conservative over (the [[homotopy type theory]] based upon) [[weak type theory|weak]] Martin-Löf type theory?

* How much of the [[HoTT book]] could be done in [[weak type theory]]?

* Does [[weak type theory]] have [[homotopy canonicity]] and [[normalization]]?

Other problems include

* What is the [[categorical semantics]] of the [[homotopy type theory]] based upon [[weak type theory]], with all [[higher inductive types]] and [[weakly Tarski]] [[univalent universes]]? 

* Is [[weak function extensionality]] equivalent to [[function extensionality]] in [[weak type theory]]?

* Does [[product extensionality]] hold in [[weak type theory]]? Namely, given types $A$ and $B$ and elements $a:A \times B$ and $b:A \times B$, is the canonical function $\mathrm{idtoprojectionids}:(a =_{A \times B} b) \to (\pi_1(a) \simeq \pi_1(b)) \times (\pi_2(a) \simeq \pi_2(b))$ an [[equivalence of types]]?

* Is [[function extensionality]] still provable in weak [[cubical type theory]]?
