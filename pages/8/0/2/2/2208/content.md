Given a family of structures of the same signature in the sense of [[model theory]] (or more specially, [[universal algebra]]), one can use [[ultrafilters]] to (assuming the [[ultrafilter principle]], a weak form of the [[axiom of choice]]) form a certain [[congruence]] on the [[direct product]] and construct a [[quotient object]], a new structure of the same signature, called the __ultraproduct__. The ultraproduct of some number of copies of the same structure may be called an __ultrapower__.

The [[hyperreal number]]s ([wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreal_numbers)) and nonstandard integers in [[nonstandard analysis]] are obtained as a countable ultrapowers. See [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraproduct).
