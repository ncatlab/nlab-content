Given a family of structures of the same signature in the sense of [[model theory]] (or more specially, [[universal algebra]]), one can (assuming the [[ultrafilter principle]], a weak form of the [[axiom of choice]]) use [[ultrafilters]] to form a certain [[congruence]] on the [[direct product]] and construct a [[quotient object]], a new structure of the same signature, called the __ultraproduct__. The ultraproduct of some number of copies of the same structure may be called an __ultrapower__.

The [[hyperreal number]]s ([wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreal_numbers)) and nonstandard integers in [[nonstandard analysis]] are obtained as a countable ultrapowers with help of [[free ultrafilters]] in $\mathbb{N}$. Such ultrafilters contain all cofinite subsets of integers, but not only them. See [wikipedia:ultraproduct](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraproduct).

From Michael Barr's [Models of Sketches](http://archive.numdam.org/ARCHIVE/CTGDC/CTGDC_1986__27_2/CTGDC_1986__27_2_93_0/CTGDC_1986__27_2_93_0.pdf)  

>Unlike limits and colimits, an ultraproduct is not defined by any universal mapping property. Of course, if the category has limits and (filtered) colimits, then it has ultraproducts constructed as colimits of products...But usually the category of models of a coherent theory (such as the theory of fields) lacks products and hence does not have categorical ultraproducts.
