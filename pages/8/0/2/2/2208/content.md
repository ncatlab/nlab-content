Given a family of structures of the same signature in the sense of [[model theory]] (or more specially, [[universal algebra]]), assuming the [[axiom of choice]], and using ultrafilters, to form a certain relation of equivalence on the underlying set of the cartesian product, one can construct a quotient of the cartesian product, a new structure of the same signature, their __ultraproduct__. Ultraproduct of some number of the copies of the same structure may be called an __ultrapower__.

The hyperreal numbers ([wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreal_numbers)) and nonstandard (or nonstandard) integers in [[nonstandard analysis]] are obtained as a countable ultrapower. See [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraproduct).
