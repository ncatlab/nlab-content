## Idea

Complex projective space $\mathbb{C}P^n$ is the [[projective space]] $\mathbb{A}P^n$ for $\mathbb{A} = \mathbb{C}$ being the [[complex numbers]] (and for $n \in \mathbb{N}$), a [[complex manifold]] of complex [[dimension]] $n$ (real dimension $2n$). Equivalently, this is the complex [[Grassmannian]] $Gr_1(\mathbb{C}^{n+1})$. For the special case $n = 1$ then $\mathbb{C}P^1 \simeq S^2$ is the [[Riemann sphere]].

As $n$ ranges, there are natural inclusions

$$
  \ast = \mathbb{C}P^0
    \hookrightarrow
  \mathbb{C}P^1
    \hookrightarrow
  \mathbb{C}P^2
    \hookrightarrow
  \mathbb{C}P^3
    \hookrightarrow
  \cdots
  \,.
$$

The [[sequential colimit]] over this sequence is the infinite complex projective space $\mathbb{C}P^\infty$. This is a model for the [[classifying space]] $B U(1)$ of [[circle principal bundles]]/[[complex line bundles]] (an [[Eilenberg-MacLane space]] $K(\mathbb{Z},2)$).

## Definition
 {#Definition}

+-- {: .num_defn #ComplexProjectiveSpace}
###### Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then **complex $n$-dimensional complex projective space** is the [[complex manifold]] (often just regarded as its underlying [[topological space]]) defined as the [[quotient]]

$$
  \mathbb{C}P^n \coloneqq (\mathbb{C}^{n+1}-\{0\})/_\sim
$$

of the [[Cartesian product]] of $(n+1)$-copies of the [[complex plane]], with the origin removed, by the [[equivalence relation]]

$$
  (z \sim w) \Leftrightarrow (z = \kappa \cdot w)
$$

for some $\kappa \in \mathbb{C} - \{0\}$ and using the canonical multiplicative [[action]] of $\mathbb{C}$ on $\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$.

The canonical inclusions

$$
  \mathbb{C}^{n+1} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{C}^{n+2}
$$

induce canonical inclusions

$$
  \mathbb{C}P^n \hookrightarrow \mathbb{C}P^{n+1}
  \,.
$$

The [[sequential colimit]] over this sequence of inclusions is the _infinite complex projective space_

$$
  \mathbb{C}P^\infty
    \coloneqq
  \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_n \mathbb{C}P^n
  \,.
$$
=--

The following equivalent characterizations are immediate but useful:

+-- {: .num_prop #ComplexProjectiveSpaceAsGrassmannian}
###### Proposition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, we have that complex projective space, def. \ref{ComplexProjectiveSpace}, is equivalently the complex [[Grassmannian]]

$$
  \mathbb{C}P^n \simeq Gr_1(\mathbb{C}^{n+1})
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #ComplexProjectiveSpaceAsS1Quotient}
###### Proposition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ then complex projective space, def. \ref{ComplexProjectiveSpace}, is equivalently

1. the [[coset]]

   $$
     \mathbb{C}P^n \simeq U(n+1)/(U(n) \times U(1))
     \,,
   $$

1. the quotient of the [[n-sphere|(2n+1)-sphere]] by the [[circle group]] $S^1 \simeq \{ \kappa  \in \mathbb{C}| {\vert \kappa \vert} = 1\}$

  $$
    \mathbb{C}P^n \simeq S^{2n+1}/S^1
    \,.
  $$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

To see the second characterization from def. \ref{ComplexProjectiveSpace}:

With ${\vert -\vert} \colon \mathbb{C}^{n} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ the standard [[norm]], we have that every element $\vec z \in \mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ is identified under the defining equivalence relation with

$$
  \frac{1}{\vert \vec z\vert}\vec z \in S^{2n+1} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{C}^{n+1}
$$

lying on the unit $(2n+1)$-sphere. This fixes the action of $\mathbb{C}-0$ up to a remaining action of complex numbers of unit [[absolute value]]. These form the [[circle group]] $S^1$. This shows that we have a [[commuting diagram]] of functions of underlying sets of the form

$$
  \array{
    S^{2n+1} &\hookrightarrow& \mathbb{C}^{n+1} \setminus \{0\}
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{q_{S^{2n+1}}}}\downarrow &\searrow^{\mathrlap{f}}& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{q_{\mathbb{C}^{n+1}}}}
    \\
    S^{2n+1}/S^1 &\longrightarrow& \mathbb{C}P^n
  }
$$

where the top horizontal and the two vertical functions are [[continuous function|continuous]], and where the bottom function is a [[bijection]].  Since the diagonal [[composition|composite]] is also continuous, the nature of the [[quotient space topology]]
implies that the bottom function is also continuous. To see that it is a [[homeomorphism]] it hence remains to 
see that it is an [[open map]] (by [this prop.](homeomorphism#HomeoContinuousOpenBijection)).

So let $U \subset S^{2n+1}/S^1$ be an open set, which means that $q_{S^{2n+1}}^{-1}(U) \subset S^{2n+1}$ is an open set.
We need to see that $f(q_{S^{2n+1}}^{-1}(U)) \subset \mathbb{C}P^{n}$ is open, hence that 
$q_{\mathbb{C}^{n+1}}^{-1}(f(q_{S^{2n+1}}^{-1}(U))) \subset \mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ is open.
Now by the nature of the [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] [[metric topology]], the open subset $q_{S^{2n+1}}^{-1}(U)$
is a union of open balls $B^\circ_x(\epsilon)$ in $\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ intersected with $S^{2n+1}$. But then $q_{\mathbb{C}^{n+1}}^{-1}(f(B^\circ_x(\epsilon)\vert_{S^{2n+1}}))$ 
is their [[orbit]] under the multiplicative action by $\mathbb{C} \setminus \{0\}$,
hence is a [[cylinder]] $B^\circ_x(\epsilon)\vert_{S^{2n+1}} \times (\mathbb{C} \setminus \{0\})$. This is clearly open.


The first characterization follows via prop. \ref{ComplexProjectiveSpaceAsGrassmannian} from the general discusion at _[[Grassmannian]]_. With this the second characterization follows also with the [[coset]] identification of the $(2n+1)$-sphere: $S^{2n+1} \simeq U(n+1)/U(n)$ ([exmpl.](unitary+group#nSphereAsUnitaryCosetSpace)).

+-- {: .num_prop #CellComplexStructureOnComplexProjectiveSpace}
###### Proposition
**([[cell structure of projective spaces]])**

There is a [[CW-complex]] structure on complex projective space $\mathbb{C}P^n$ (def. \ref{ComplexProjectiveSpace}) for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, given by [[induction]], where $\mathbb{C}P^{n+1}$ arises from $\mathbb{C}P^n$ by [[attaching space|attaching]] a single cell of dimension $2(n+1)$ with [[attaching map]] the [[projection]] $S^{2n+1} \longrightarrow \mathbb{C}P^n$ from prop. \ref{ComplexProjectiveSpaceAsS1Quotient}:

$$
  \array{
     S^{2n+1} &\longrightarrow& S^{2n+1}/S^1 \simeq \mathbb{C}P^n
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\iota_{2n+2}}}\downarrow^{\mathrlap{i_n}}
       &(po)& \downarrow
     \\
     D^{2n+2} &\underset{q}{\longrightarrow}& \mathbb{C}P^{n+1}
  }
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


Given [[homogeneous coordinates]] $(z_1 ,  \cdots ,  z_n ,  z_{n+1} ,  z_{n+2}) \in \mathbb{C}^{n+2}$ for $\mathbb{C}P^{n+1}$, let

$$
  \phi \coloneqq -arg(z_{n+2})
$$

be the [[phase]] of $z_{n+2}$. Then under the equivalence relation defining $\mathbb{C}P^{n+1}$ these coordinates represent the same element as

$$
  \frac{1}{\vert \vec z\vert}(e^{i \phi} z_1, e^{i \phi}z_2,\cdots, e^{i \phi}z_{n+1}, r)
  \,,
$$

where

$$
  r = {\vert z_{n+2}\vert}\in [0,1] \subset \mathbb{C}
$$

is the [[absolute value]] of $z_{n+2}$. Representatives $\vec z'$ of this form (${\vert \vec z' \vert = 1}$ and $z'_{n+2} \in [0,1]$) parameterize the [[n-disk|2n+2-disk]] $D^{2n+2}$,  with [[boundary]] being the $(2n+1)$-sphere at $r = 0$. 

The resulting function $q \colon D^{2n+2} \to \mathbb{C}P^{n+1}$ is continuous: It may be factored as

$$
  \array{
    q_{D^{2n+2}} \colon & D^{2n+2} &\overset{\phantom{AAA}}{\hookrightarrow}& \mathbb{C}^{n+2} \setminus \{0\} &\overset{q_{\mathbb{C}^{n+2}}}{\longrightarrow}&  \mathbb{C}P^{n+1}
    \\
    & (Re(z_1), Im(z_1),  \cdots, Re(z_{n+1}), Im(z_{n+1}), r) &\mapsto& (z_1, \cdots, z_{n+1}, r)  &\mapsto& [ z_1 : \cdots : z_{n+1} : r ]
  }
  \,.
$$

Here the first map is the [[embedding of topological spaces|embedding]] of the disk $D^{2n+2}$ as a [[hemisphere]] in $\mathbb{R}^{2n+1} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^{2n+2} \simeq \mathbb{C}^{2n+2}$, while the second is the defining quotient space projection.
Both of these mare are evidently continuous, and hence so is their composite.

The only remaining part of the action of $\mathbb{C}-\{0\}$ which fixes the conditions ${\vert z'\vert} = 0$ and $z'_{n+2}$ is 
$S^1 \subset \mathbb{C} \setminus \{0\}$ acting on the elements with $ r = \{z'_{n+2}\} = 0$ by phase shifts on the $z_0, \cdots, z_{n+1}$. 
The quotient of this remaining action on $D^{2(n+1)}$ identifies its boundary $S^{2n+1}$-sphere with $\mathbb{C}P^{n}$, by prop. \ref{ComplexProjectiveSpaceAsS1Quotient}.

This shows that the above square is a [[pushout]] diagram of underlying sets.  

By the nature of [[colimits]] in [[Top]] ([this prop.](Top#DescriptionOfLimitsAndColimitsInTop)) 
it remains to see that the
[[topological space|topology]] on $\mathbb{C}P^{n+1}$ is the [[final topology]] induced by the functions
$D^{2n+2} \to \mathbb{C}P^{n+1}$ and $\mathbb{C}P^n \to \mathbb{C}P^{n+1}$, hence that a subset of 
$\mathbb{C}P^{n+1}$ is open precisely if its pre-images under these two functions are open.

We saw above that $q_{D^{2n+2}}$ is continuous.
Moreover, also the function 
$i_n \colon \mathbb{C}P^n \to \mathbb{C}P^{n+1}$ is continuous (by [this lemma](projective+space#CanonicalInclusionOfProjectiveSpaces)).

This shows that if a subset of $\mathbb{C}P^{n+1}$ is open, then its pre-images under these functions are open.
It remains to see that if $S \subset \mathbb{C}P^{n+1}$ is a subset with $q_{S^{2n+2}}^{-1}(S) \subset D^{2n+2}$ open and
$i_n^{-1}(S) \subset \mathbb{C}P^n$ open, then $S \subset \mathbb{C}P^{n+1}$ is open.

Notice that $q_{\mathbb{C}^{n+2}}^{-1}(S)$ contains with every point also its [[orbit]] under the [[action]] 
of $\mathbb{C} \setminus \{0\}$, and that every open subset of $D^{2n+2}$ is a unions of open balls.
By the above factorization of $q_{D^{2n+2}}$ this means that if $q_{D^{2n+2}}^{-1}(S)$ is open, then 
$q_{\mathbb{C}^{n+2}}^{-1}(S)$ is a union of open cyclinders, hence is open. By the nature of the 
[[quotient topology]], this means that $S \subset \mathbb{C}P^n$ is open.

### Homotopy groups
  {#HomotopyGroups}



\begin{prop}
  For $n \geq 1$, the [[homotopy groups]] of [[complex projective space]] $\mathbb{C}P^n$ are the [[integers]] in degree 2, the [[homotopy groups of spheres|homotopy groups of]] the [[n-sphere|2n+1-sphere]] in degrees $\geq 2n+1$ and [[trivial group|trivial]] otherwise:
\[
  \label{ListOfHomotopyGroupsOfComplexProjectiveSpace}
    \pi_k
    \big(
      \mathbb{C}P^n
    \big)
    \;=\;
    \left\{
    \array{
      \ast &\vert& k = 0
      \\
      1 &\vert& k = 1
      \\
      \mathbb{Z} &\vert& k = 2
      \\
      \mathbb{Z} &\vert& k = 2n + 1
      \\
      \pi_k
      \big(
        S^{2n+1}
      \big)
      &\vert&
      k \geq 2n+1
      \\
      0 &\vert& otherwise
    }
    \right.
\]
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
  Essentially by definition, $\mathbb{C}P^n$ is the [[quotient space]] of the [[circle group]]-[[action]] on the [[unit sphere]]  $S^{2n+1} \simeq S\big(\mathbb{C}^{2n+2}\big)$ (e.g. [Bott & Tu 1982, Exp. 14.22](#BottTu82)). 

First of all, this implies that $\mathbb{C}P^n$ is [[connected topological space|connected]], since $S^{2n+1}$ is, hence $\pi_0\big( \mathbb{C}P^n\big) = \ast$.

Moreover, since this is a [[free action]], we have a [[circle principal bundle]] and hence a [[fiber sequence]] of the form

\begin{xymatrix@C=20pt@R=20pt}
  S^1 
  \ar[r]
  &
  S^{2n+1}
  \ar[d]
  \\
  &
  \mathbb{C}P^n
  \,.
\end{xymatrix}

Therefore the homotopy groups of $\mathbb{C}P^n$ sit in the corresponding [[long exact sequence of homotopy groups]], hence in a [[long exact sequence]] of [[abelian groups]] of this form:

\begin{xymatrix@C=20pt@R=20pt}
  \cdots
  \ar[r]
  &
  \pi_{k+1}
  \big(
    \mathbb{C}P^k
  \big)
  \ar[r]
  &
  \pi_k
  \big(
    S^1
  \big)
  \ar[r]
  &
  \pi_k
  \big(
    S^{2n+1}
  \big)
  \ar[r]
  &
  \pi_k
  \big(
    \mathbb{C}P^n
  \big)
  \ar[r]
  &
  \pi_{k-1}
  \big(
    S^1
  \big)
  \ar[r]
  &
  \cdots
\end{xymatrix}

By the following two basic facts about the [[homotopy groups of spheres]]

$$
  \pi_{k \geq 2}
  \big(
    S^1
  \big)
  \;=\;
  0
  \,,
  \phantom{AAAA}
  \pi_{k \leq 2n}
  \big(
    S^{2n+1}
  \big)
  \;=\;
  0
$$

this long exact sequence contains the parts (using here the assumption that $n \geq 1$):

\begin{xymatrix@C=20pt@R=20pt}
  \pi_1
  \big(
    S^{2n+1}
  \big)
  \ar@{=}[d]

and 

\begin{xymatrix@C=20pt@R=20pt}
  \pi_2
  \big(
    S^{2n+1}
  \big)
  \ar@{=}[d]

  \big)
  \ar@{=}[r]
  &
  \mathbb{Z}
  \ar[r]
  &
  0
\end{xymatrix}

and these parts, for all $k \geq 3$:

\begin{xymatrix@C=20pt@R=20pt}
  \pi_{k}
  \big(
    S^1
  \big)
  \ar@{=}[d]
  \ar[r]

  &
  \pi_k
  \big(
    \mathbb{C}P^n
  \big)
  \ar[r]
  &
  0
\end{xymatrix}

In all cases the identification in the bottom line follows from [[exact sequence|exactness]], given that the two outer items are [[trivial group|trivial]].

This gives the list (eq:ListOfHomotopyGroupsOfComplexProjectiveSpace), where we just made explicit that $\pi_{2n+1}(S^{2n+1}) = \mathbb{Z}$ (the [[Hopf degree theorem]], if you wish).

### Homology and Cohomology
 {#Cohomology}

#### Ordinary
 {#OrdinaryHomologyAndCohomology}

+-- {: .num_prop #OrdinaryCohomologyOfComplexProjectiveSpace}
###### Proposition

For $A \in $ [[Ab]] any [[abelian group]], then the [[ordinary homology]] [[homology groups|groups]] of complex projective space $\mathbb{C}P^n$ with [[coefficients]] in $A$ are

$$
  H_k(\mathbb{C}P^n,A)\simeq
  \left\{
    \array{
       A & for \; k \;even\; and \; k \leq 2n
       \\
       0 & otherwise
    }
  \right.
  \,.
$$

Similarly the [[ordinary cohomology]] [[cohomology groups|groups]] of $\mathbb{C}P^n$ is

$$
  H^k(\mathbb{C}P^n,A)
   \simeq
  \left\{
    \array{
       A & for \; k \;even\; and \; k \leq 2n
       \\
       0 & otherwise
    }
  \right.
  \,.
$$

Moreover, if $A$ carries the structure of a [[ring]] $R = (A, \cdot)$, then under the [[cup product]] the [[cohomology ring]] of $\mathbb{C}P^n$ is the the [[graded ring]]

$$
  H^\bullet(\mathbb{C}P^n, R)
   \simeq
  R[c_1] / (c_1^{n+1})
$$

which is the [[quotient]] of the [[polynomial ring]] on a single generator $c_1$ in degree 2, by the relation that identifies [[cup products]] of more than $n$-copies of the generator $c_1$ with zero.

Finally, the [[cohomology ring]] of the infinite-dimensional complex projective space is the [[formal power series ring]] in one generator:

$$
  H^\bullet(\mathbb{C}P^\infty, R)
   \simeq
  R[ [ c_1 ] ]
  \,.
$$

(Or else the [[polynomial ring]] $R[c_1]$, depending on how one chooses to extract a ring from a graded ring, see remark \ref{ChoiceOfRingStructureOnGradedCohomologyGroupOfMultiplicativeCohomologyTheory}.)

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First consider the case that the coefficients are the [[integers]] $A = \mathbb{Z}$.

Since $\mathbb{C}P^n$ admits the structure of a [[CW-complex]] by prop. \ref{CellComplexStructureOnComplexProjectiveSpace}, we may compute its [[ordinary homology]] equivalently as its [[cellular homology]] ([thm.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+I#CelluarEquivalentToSingularFromSpectralSequence)). By definition ([defn.](cellular+homology#CellularChainComplex)) this is the [[chain homology]] of the chain complex of [[relative homology]] groups

$$
  \cdots
    \overset{\partial_{cell}}{\longrightarrow}
  H_{q+2}((\mathbb{C}P^n)_{q+2}, (\mathbb{C}P^n)_{q+1})
   \overset{\partial_{cell}}{\longrightarrow}
  H_{q+1}((\mathbb{C}P^n)_{q+1}, (\mathbb{C}P^n)_{q})
   \overset{\partial_{cell}}{\longrightarrow}
  H_{q}((\mathbb{C}P^n)_{q}, (\mathbb{C}P^n)_{q-1})
    \overset{\partial_{cell}}{\longrightarrow}
  \cdots
  \,,
$$

where $(-)_q$ denotes the $q$th stage of the [[CW-complex]]-structure. Using the CW-complex structure provided by prop. \ref{CellComplexStructureOnComplexProjectiveSpace}, then there are cells only in every second degree, so that

$$
  (\mathbb{C}P^n)_{2k+1} = (\mathbb{C}P)_{2k}
$$

for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$. It follows that the cellular chain complex has a zero group in every second degree, so that all differentials vanish. Finally, since prop. \ref{CellComplexStructureOnComplexProjectiveSpace} says that $(\mathbb{C}P^n)_{2k+2}$ arises from $(\mathbb{C}P^n)_{2k+1} = (\mathbb{C}P^n)_{2k}$ by attaching a single $2k+2$-cell it follows that (by passage to [[reduced homology]])

$$
  H_{2k}(\mathbb{C}P^n, \mathbb{Z})
    \simeq
  \tilde H_{2k}(S^{2k})((\mathbb{C}P^n)_{2k}/(\mathbb{C}P^n)_{2k-1})
   \simeq
  \tilde H_{2k}(S^{2k})
    \simeq
  \mathbb{Z}
  \,.
$$

This establishes the claim for ordinary homology with integer coefficients.

In particular this means that $H_q(\mathbb{C}P^n, \mathbb{Z})$ is a [[free abelian group]] for all $q$. Since free abelian groups are the [[projective objects]] in [[Ab]] ([prop.](projective+object#ProjectiveObjectsInAbAreFreeGroups)) it follows (with the discussion at _[[derived functors in homological algebra]]_) that the [[Ext]]-groups vanishe:

$$
  Ext^1(H_q(\mathbb{C}P^n, \mathbb{Z}),A) = 0
$$

and the [[Tor]]-groups vanishes:

$$
 Tor_1(H_q(\mathbb{C}P^n), A) = 0
  \,.
$$

With this, the statement about homology and cohomology groups with general coefficients follows with the [[universal coefficient theorem]] for ordinary homology ([thm.](universal+coefficient+theorem#TheoremInOrdinaryHomology)) and for ordinary cohomology ([thm.](universal+coefficient+theorem#OrdinaryStatementInCohomology)).

Finally to see the action of the [[cup product]]: by definition this is the composite

$$
  \cup
  \;\colon\;
  H^\bullet(\mathbb{C}P^n, R)
  \otimes
  H^\bullet(\mathbb{C}P^n, R)
    \longrightarrow
  H^\bullet(\mathbb{C}P^n \times \mathbb{C}P^n , R)
    \overset{\Delta^\ast}{\longrightarrow}
  H^\bullet(\mathbb{C}P^n,R)

of the "cross-product" map that appears in the [[Kunneth theorem]], and the pullback along the [[diagonal]] $\Delta\colon \mathbb{C}P^n \to \mathbb{C}P^n \times \mathbb{C}P^n$.

Since, by the above, the groups $H^{2k}(\mathbb{C}P^n,R) \simeq R[2k]$ and $H^{2k+1}(\mathbb{C}P^n,R) = 0$ are free and finitely generated, the [[Kunneth theorem]] in ordinary cohomology applies ([prop.](K&#252;nneth+theorem#KunnethInOrdinaryCohomology)) and says that the cross-product map above is an isomorphism. This shows that under cup product pairs of generators are sent to a generator, and so the statement $H^\bullet(\mathbb{C}P^n , R)\simeq R[c_1](c_1^{n+1})$ follows.

This also implies that the projection maps

$$
  H^\bullet((\mathbb{C}P^\infty)_{2n+2}, R)
  =
  H^\bullet(\mathbb{C}P^{n+1}, R)
  \to
  H^\bullet(\mathbb{C}P^{n+}, R)
  =
  H^\bullet((\mathbb{C}P^\infty)_{2n}, R)
$$

are all [[epimorphisms]]. Therefore this sequence satisfies the [[Mittag-Leffler condition]] ([def.](lim1#MittagLefflerCondition), [exmpl.](lim1#MittagLefflerSatisfiedInParticularForTowerOfSurjections)) and therefore the [[Milnor exact sequence]] for cohomology ([prop.](lim1#MilorSequenceForReducedCohomologyOnCWComplex)) implies the last claim to be proven:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    H^\bullet(\mathbb{C}P^\infty, R)
    &
     \simeq
    H^\bullet( \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_n \mathbb{C}P^n , R)
   \\
    &\simeq \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_n H^\bullet(\mathbb{C}P^n, R)
   \\
   &\simeq \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_n ( R [c_1^E] / ((c_1)^{n+1})  )
   \\

+-- {: .num_remark #ChoiceOfRingStructureOnGradedCohomologyGroupOfMultiplicativeCohomologyTheory}
###### Remark

There is in general a choice to be made in interpreting the [[cohomology groups]] of a [[multiplicative cohomology theory]] $E$ as a [[ring]]:

a priori $E^\bullet(X)$ is a sequence

$$
  \{E^n(X)\}_{n \in \mathbb{Z}}
$$

of [[abelian groups]], together with a system of group homomorphisms

$$
  E^{n_1}(X) \otimes E^{n_2}(X)
    \longrightarrow
  E^{n_1 + n_2}(X)
  \,,
$$

one for each pair $(n_1,n_2) \in \mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$.

In turning this into a single [[ring]] by forming [[formal sums]] of elements in the groups $E^n(X)$, there is in general the choice of whether allowing formal sums of only finitely many elements, or allowing arbitrary formal sums.

In the former case the ring obtained is the [[direct sum]]

$$
  \oplus_{n \in \mathbb{N}} E^n(X)
$$

while in the latter case it is the [[Cartesian product]]

$$
  \prod_{n \in \mathbb{N}} E^n (X)
  \,.
$$

These differ in general. For instance if $E$ is [[ordinary cohomology]] with [[integer]] [[coefficients]] and $X$ is complex projective space $\mathbb{C}P^\infty$, then (prop. \ref{OrdinaryCohomologyOfComplexProjectiveSpace})

$$
  E^n(X)
  =
  \left\{
    \array{
      \mathbb{Z} & n \; even
      \\
      0 & otherwise
    }
  \right.
$$

and the product operation is given by

$$
  E^{2{n_1}}(X)\otimes E^{2 n_2}(X)
    \longrightarrow
  E^{2(n_1 + n_2)}(X)
$$

for all $n_1, n_2$ (and zero in odd degrees, necessarily).  Now taking the [[direct sum]] of these, this is the [[polynomial ring]] on one generator (in degree 2)

$$
  \oplus_{n \in \mathbb{N}} E^n(X) \;\simeq\; \mathbb{Z}[c_1]
  \,.
$$

But taking the [[Cartesian product]], then this is the [[formal power series ring]]

$$
  \prod_{n \in \mathbb{N}} E^n(X) \;\simeq\; \mathbb{Z} [ [ c_1 ] ]
  \,.
$$

A priori both of these are sensible choices. The former is the usual choice in traditional [[algebraic topology]]. However, from the point of view of regarding [[ordinary cohomology]] theory as a [[multiplicative cohomology theory]] right away, then the second perspective tends to be more natural:

The cohomology of $\mathbb{C}P^\infty$ is naturally computed as the [[inverse limit]] of the cohomolgies of the $\mathbb{C}P^n$, each of which unambiguously has the ring structure $\mathbb{Z}[c_1]/((c_1)^{n+1})$. So we may naturally take the limit in the [[category]] of [[commutative rings]] right away, instead of first taking it in $\mathbb{Z}$-indexed sequences of abelian groups, and then looking for ring structure on the result. But the limit taken in the category of rings gives the [[formal power series ring]] (see [here](formal+scheme#FormalPowerSeries)).

Incidentally, this is the default choice of ring structure for [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology|generalized]] [[multiplicative cohomology theories]] evaluated on $\mathbb{C}P^\infty$. In particular in [[complex oriented cohomology]] (see there) this choice is of paramount importance.

See also for instance remark 1.1. in [[Jacob Lurie]]: _[[A Survey of Elliptic Cohomology]]_.

#### Complex-oriented

+-- {: .num_prop #CohomologyRingOfBU1ForComplexOrientedCohomologyTheory}
###### Proposition

Given a [[complex oriented cohomology theory]] $(E^\bullet, c^E_1)$ ([defn.](complex+oriented+cohomology+theory#ComplexOrientedCohomologyTheory)), then there is an [[isomorphism]] of [[graded rings]]

$$
  E^\bullet(\mathbb{C}P^\infty) \simeq E^\bullet(\ast)[ [ c_1^E ] ]
$$

between the $E$-[[cohomology ring]] of infinite-dimensional complex projective space and the [[formal power series]] in one generator of even degree over the $E$-[[cohomology ring]] of the point.


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Using the [[CW-complex]]-structure on $\mathbb{C}P^\infty$ from prop. \ref{CellComplexStructureOnComplexProjectiveSpace}, given by inductively identifying $\mathbb{C}P^{n+1}$ with the result of attaching a single $2n$-cell to $\mathbb{C}P^n$. With this structure, the unique 2-cell inclusion $i \;\colon\; S^2 \hookrightarrow \mathbb{C}P^\infty$ is identified with the canonical map $S^2 \to B U(1)$.

Then consider the [[Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence]] for the $E$-cohomology of $\mathbb{C}P^n$.

$$
  H^\bullet(\mathbb{C}P^n, E^\bullet(\ast))
  \;\Rightarrow\;
  E^\bullet(\mathbb{C}P^n)
  \,.
$$

Since, by prop. \ref{OrdinaryCohomologyOfComplexProjectiveSpace}, the [[ordinary cohomology]] with [[integer]] [[coefficients]] of projective space is

$$
  H^\bullet(\mathbb{C}P^n, \mathbb{Z}) \simeq \mathbb{Z}[c_1]/((c_1)^{n+1})
  \,,
$$

where $c_1$ represents a unit in $H^2(S^2, \mathbb{Z})\simeq \mathbb{Z}$, and since similarly the [[ordinary homology]] of $\mathbb{C}P^n$ is a [[free abelian group]], hence a [[projective object]] in abelian groups ([prop.](projective+object#ProjectiveObjectsInAbAreFreeGroups)), the [[Ext]]-group vanishes in each degree ($Ext^1(H_n(\mathbb{C}P^n), E^\bullet(\ast)) = 0$) and so the [[universal coefficient theorem]] ([prop.](universal+coefficient+theorem#OrdinaryStatementInCohomology)) gives that the second page of the spectral sequence is

$$
  H^\bullet(\mathbb{C}P^n, E^\bullet(\ast))
  \simeq
  E^\bullet(\ast)[ c_1 ] / (c_1^{n+1})
  \,.
$$

By the standard construction of the [[Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence]] ([here](Atiyah&#8211;Hirzebruch+spectral+sequence#ConstructionByFilteringTheBaseSpace)) in this identification the element $c_1$ is identified with a generator of the [[relative cohomology]]

$$
  E^2((\mathbb{C}P^n)_2, (\mathbb{C}P^n)_1)
  \simeq
  \tilde E^2(S^2)
$$

(using, by the above, that this $S^2$ is the unique 2-cell of $\mathbb{C}P^n$ in the standard cell model).

This means that $c_1$ is a permanent cocycle of the spectral sequence (in the kernel of all differentials) precisely if it arises via restriction from an element in $E^2(\mathbb{C}P^n)$ and hence precisely if there exists a complex orientation $c_1^E$ on $E$. Since this is the case by assumption on $E$, $c_1$ is a permanent cocycle. (For the fully detailed argument see ([Pedrotti 16](#Pedrotti16)).)

The same argument applied to all elements in $E^\bullet(\ast)[c]$, or else the $E^\bullet(\ast)$-linearity of the differentials ([prop.](multiplicative+cohomology+theory#LinearityOfDifferentialsInSerreAHSSForMultiplicativeCohomologyTheory)), implies that all these elements are permanent cocycles.

Since the AHSS of a multiplicative cohomology theory is a [[multiplicative spectral sequence]] ([prop.](multiplicative+cohomology+theory#AHSSForMultiplicativeCohomologyTheoryIsMultiplicative)) this implies that the differentials in fact vanish on all elements of $E^\bullet(\ast) [c_1] / (c_1^{n+1})$, hence that the given AHSS collapses on the second page to give

$$
  \mathcal{E}_\infty^{\bullet,\bullet}
  \simeq
  E^\bullet(\ast)[ c_1^{E} ] / ((c_1^E)^{n+1})
$$

or in more detail:

$$
  \mathcal{E}_\infty^{p,\bullet}
  \simeq
  \left\{
    \array{
      E^\bullet(\ast) & \text{if}\; p \leq  2n \; and\; even
      \\
      0 & otherwise
    }
  \right.
  \,.
$$

Moreover, since therefore all $\mathcal{E}_\infty^{p,\bullet}$ are [[free modules]] over $E^\bullet(\ast)$, and since the filter stage inclusions $F^{p+1} E^\bullet(X) \hookrightarrow F^{p}E^\bullet(X)$ are $E^\bullet(\ast)$-[[module]] homomorphisms ([prop.](multiplicative+cohomology+theory#RingAndModuleStructureOnCohomologyGroupsOfMultiplicativeCohomplogyTheory)) the [extension problem](spectral+sequence#ExtensionProblem) trivializes, in that all the [[short exact sequences]]

$$
  0 \to F^{p+1}E^{p+\bullet}(X) \longrightarrow F^{p}E^{p+\bullet}(X) \longrightarrow \mathcal{E}_\infty^{p,\bullet} \to 0
$$

[[split exact sequence|split]] (since the [[Ext]]-group $Ext^1_{E^\bullet(\ast)}(\mathcal{E}_\infty^{p,\bullet},-) = 0$ vanishes on the [[free module]], hence [[projective module]] $\mathcal{E}_\infty^{p,\bullet}$).

In conclusion, this gives an isomorphism of graded rings

$$
  E^\bullet(\mathbb{C}P^n)
  \simeq
  \underset{p}{\oplus} \mathcal{E}_\infty^{p,\bullet}
  \simeq
  E^\bullet(\ast)[ c_1 ] / ((c_1^{E})^{n+1})
  \,.
$$

A first consequence is that the projection maps

$$
  E^\bullet((\mathbb{C}P^\infty)_{2n+2})
  =
  E^\bullet(\mathbb{C}P^{n+1})
  \to
  E^\bullet(\mathbb{C}P^{n+})
  =
  E^\bullet((\mathbb{C}P^\infty)_{2n})
$$

are all [[epimorphisms]]. Therefore this sequence satisfies the [[Mittag-Leffler condition]] ([def.](lim1#MittagLefflerCondition), [exmpl.](lim1#MittagLefflerSatisfiedInParticularForTowerOfSurjections)) and therefore the [[Milnor exact sequence]] for generalized cohomology ([prop.](lim1#MilorSequenceForReducedCohomologyOnCWComplex)) finally implies the claim:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    E^\bullet(B U(1))
     & \simeq
    E^\bullet(\mathbb{C}P^\infty)
    \\
    & \simeq
    E^\bullet( \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_n \mathbb{C}P^n )
   \\
    &\simeq \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_n E^\bullet(\mathbb{C}P^n)
   \\
   &\simeq \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_n ( E^\bullet(\ast) [c_1^E] / ((c_1^E)^{n+1})  )
   \\
   & \simeq E^\bullet(\ast)[ [ c_1^E ] ]
   \,,
  \end{aligned}
$$

where the last step is [this prop.](formal+scheme#FormalPowerSeries).
