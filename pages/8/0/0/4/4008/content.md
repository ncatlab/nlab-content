## Definition

A **connected limit** is a [[limit]] over a [[connected category]]. Similarly, a **connected colimit** is a colimit over a connected category. 

A basic example of a connected limit is a [[wide pullback]], where the limit is taken over a diagram whose underlying shape is the poset obtained by adjoining a terminal element to a discrete poset.

######Theorem 
A category admits a limit over any connected category if and only if it admits wide pullbacks. A functor $F: C \to D$ preserves connected limits if and only if it preserves all wide pullbacks.
