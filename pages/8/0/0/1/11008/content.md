## Idea

_HOL_ (short for [[higher-order logic]]) is a kind of [[simply typed lambda calculus]]. There are various [[proof assistant|proof assistants]] that implement this language. The most known one is _[[Isabelle]]_, that has HOL or Isabelle/HOL as its main application.

Other proof assistants of this kind are HOL4, [[HOL Light]], HOL Zero, and ProofPower.
