I am a mathematical physicist/mathematician from Zagreb.
My longer scientific biography is [[zoranskoda:careerpage]]. My Ph.D. is from University of Wisconsin-Madison, 2002 (title: _Coset spaces for quantum groups_ (<a href="https://www.irb2.hr/korisnici/zskoda/abs1">abstract</a>)). I currently teach mathematics as an associate professor at the University of Zadar, Croatia; 2015-2021 I worked part time on a research project as an associate professor at the University of Hradec Kr&#225;lov&#233;, Czech Republic. I supervise some graduate students at the University of Zagreb, Croatia (where I have an adjunct title of docent) and maintain some scientific ties and collaboration with Theoretical Physics Division of the Institute Rudjer Bo&#353;kovi&#263;, Zagreb, Croatia, where I was previously employed. In Croatia there is a national accreditation of the scientific titles: I hold the titles of a senior scientist in mathematics (2020) and a research associate in physics (2016). 

My mathematical interests include
geometric aspects of mathematical physics (TQFT, [[geometric
quantization]], [[coherent states]] etc.),
[[noncommutative algebraic geometry]] and [[noncommutative localization]], [[Hopf algebra]]s, [[bialgebroid]]s, categories, [[cohomology]], 
in particular nonabelian cohomology/[[descent]] theory. 

My other scientific interests include historical linguistics (general principles and Indo-European), interface between language and computation (computational [[linguistics]], construction of compilers and computer language design), [[blockchain]] technology and medical herbs (herbal tea) but most of these past hobbies are latent now for a long time. I used to play piano [accordion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accordion). My native tongue is the [kajkavian dialect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kajkavian_dialect) of Croatian. In Croatian we use diacritics for the sch-sound: &#352;koda.

I have also a personalized part of $n$lab [[zoranskoda:HomePage|here]] with some coursepages for students, and other pages not in close accord with purposes and collaborative nature of $n$lab proper.
