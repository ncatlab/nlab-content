I am a mathematical physicist/mathematician from Zagreb. My Ph.D. is from University of Wisconsin-Madison, 2002. My thesis title was *Coset spaces for quantum groups*. Here is an <a href="http://www.irb.hr/korisnici/zskoda/abs1">abstract</a>. My mathematical interests include
geometric aspects of mathematical physics (TQFT, [[geometric
quantization]], [[coherent states]] etc.),
[[noncommutative algebraic geometry]] and [[noncommutative localization]], [[Hopf algebras]], categories, [[cohomology]], 
in particular nonabelian cohomology/[[descent]] theory. 

My other scientific interests include historical linguistics (general principles and Indo-European), interface between language and computation (computational linguistics, construction of compilers and computer language design), and medical herbs (herbal tea) but all these past hobbies are latent now for a long time. I used to play piano [accordion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accordion). My native tongue is the [kajkavian dialect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kajkavian_dialect) of Croatian. In Croatian we use diacritics for the sch-sound: &#352;koda.

Here is a list of some of my mathematical/physical [[zoranskoda:my writings|articles]] and [[zoranskoda:talks|talks]]. My other web page is [here](http://www.irb.hr/korisnici/zskoda).
