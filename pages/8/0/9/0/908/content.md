I am a mathematical physicist/mathematician from Zagreb. My Ph.D. is from University of Wisconsin-Madison, 2002. I currently teach mathematics as a docent at the University of Zadar, Croatia; work part time on a research project as an associate professor at the University of Hradec Kr&#225;lov&#233;, Czech Republic, supervise some graduate students at the University of Zagreb, Croatia (where I have an adjunct title of docent) and maintain some scientific ties and collaboration with Theoretical Physics Division of the Institute Rudjer Bo&#353;kovi&#263;, Zagreb, Croatia, where I was previously employed. In Croatia there is a national accreditation of the scientific titles: I hold the titles of a senior research associate in mathematics (2014) and a research associate in physics (2016). 

My thesis title was *Coset spaces for quantum groups*. Here is an <a href="http://www.irb.hr/korisnici/zskoda/abs1">abstract</a>. My mathematical interests include
geometric aspects of mathematical physics (TQFT, [[geometric
quantization]], [[coherent states]] etc.),
[[noncommutative algebraic geometry]] and [[noncommutative localization]], [[Hopf algebras]], categories, [[cohomology]], 
in particular nonabelian cohomology/[[descent]] theory. 

My other scientific interests include historical linguistics (general principles and Indo-European), interface between language and computation (computational linguistics, construction of compilers and computer language design), and medical herbs (herbal tea) but all these past hobbies are latent now for a long time. I used to play piano [accordion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accordion). My native tongue is the [kajkavian dialect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kajkavian_dialect) of Croatian. In Croatian we use diacritics for the sch-sound: &#352;koda.

I have also a personalized part of $n$lab [[zoranskoda:HomePage|here]] with some coursepages for students, and other pages not in close accord with purposes and collaborative nature of $n$lab proper.
