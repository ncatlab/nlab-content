## Definition

For a [[regular category]] $C$, the _regular coverage_ on $C$ is the [[coverage]] whose each [[covering]] family has one element which is a [[regular epimorphism]].

The [[Grothendieck topology]] generated from a regular coverage is called the _regular topology_.

[[subcanonical site|subcanonical]] [[Grothendieck topology]] whose covering families are generated by single [[regular epimorphisms]]: the [[regular coverage]].  

## Properties

* If $C$ is [[exact category|exact]] or has pullback-stable [[reflexive coequalizer]]s, then its [[codomain fibration]] is a [[stack]] for this topology (the necessary and sufficient condition is that any pullback of a kernel pair is again a kernel pair).

* For $\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{T}}$ the [[syntactic category]] of a [[regular theory]], the regular coverage makes it the [[syntactic site]], which is a site of defininition for the [[classifying topos]] of $\mathbb{T}$.
