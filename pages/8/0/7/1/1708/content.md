## Definition

An __$n$-group__ is a [[group object]] [[internalization|internal to]] $(n-1)$-[[n-groupoid|groupoids]].

If it is [[delooping|deloopable]],
an $n$-group $G$ is the [[hom-object]] $G = Aut_{\mathbf{B}G}({*})$ of an [[n-groupoid]] $\mathbf{B}G$ with a single [[object]] ${*}$.

If $\mathbf{B}G$ is a [[strict omega-groupoid|strict n-groupoid]], then the corresponding $n$-group is called a __strict $n$-group__. Strict $n$-groups are equivalent to [[crossed complex]]es of groups, of length $n$.

Under the [[homotopy hypothesis]] $n$-groups correspond to [[pointed space|pointed]] [[connected space|connected]] [[homotopy n-type]]s.


## Examples

* A $1$-group is simply a [[group]]; see also [[2-group]] and [[3-group]].

* For $n \lt 1$, there is a single $n$-group, the [[point]].

* For arbitrary $n$, there is a [[circle n-group]].

* In [[string theory]], we have the [[string 2-group]] and the [[fivebrane 6-group]].
