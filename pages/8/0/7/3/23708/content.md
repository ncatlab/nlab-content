## Definition ##

Let $S$ be a [[Cauchy space]] (such as a [[uniform space]] or a [[metric space]]). $S$ is **sequentially Cauchy-complete** if every [[Cauchy sequence]] in $S$ [[converges]].

Note that this is usually just called *Cauchy complete space* in some areas of mathematics. 

## Examples ##

* The [[Dedekind real numbers]] are sequentially Cauchy complete.
