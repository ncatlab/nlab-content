## Definition

Let $S$ be a [[Cauchy space]] (such as a [[uniform space]] or a [[metric space]]). $S$ is **sequentially complete** or **sequentially Cauchy complete** if every [[Cauchy sequence]] in $S$ [[converges]].

Note that this is usually just called *Cauchy complete space* in some areas of mathematics. 

## Examples

* The [[Dedekind real numbers]] are sequentially Cauchy complete. 

## Related concepts

* [[Cauchy space]]
* [[complete space]]
* [[modulated Cauchy complete space]]
