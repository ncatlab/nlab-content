## Definition

Let $S$ be a [[Cauchy space]] (such as a [[uniform space]] or a [[metric space]]). $S$ is **sequentially complete** or **sequentially Cauchy complete** if every [[Cauchy sequence]] in $S$ [[converges]].

We can also distinguish between the usual notion of Cauchy sequences and [[regular Cauchy sequences]], which come with a [[modulus of convergence]]. $S$ is **regularly sequentially complete** if every regular Cauchy sequence in $S$ converges.

Note that this is also called "Cauchy complete space" by some areas of [[constructive mathematics]] (see e.g. the [[HoTT Book]], [Booij 2020](#Booij20)); however the term *[[Cauchy complete space]]* is usually used for completeness via [[Cauchy nets]] or [[Cauchy filters]]. This is because in the presence of [[excluded middle]], every sequentially complete [[metric space]] is a [[complete space]]. 

## Examples

* The [[Dedekind real numbers]] are (regularly) sequentially complete. 

* The [[HoTT book real numbers]] are (regularly) sequentially complete. 

## Related concepts

* [[Cauchy space]]

* [[complete space]]
