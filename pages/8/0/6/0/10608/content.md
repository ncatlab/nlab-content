* [[William Lawvere]], 

  _Cohesive Toposes and Cantor's "lauter Einsen"_, Philosophia Mathematica (3) Vol. 2 (1994), pp. 5-15. ([[LawvereCohesiveToposes.pdf:file]])

on [[adjoint cylinders]] and [[cohesive toposes]].

This is in part motivated from attempts to formalize thoughts appearing in [[Georg Hegel]]'s _[[Science of Logic]]_ on [[unity of opposites]].

Concretely it is about the [[unity of opposites]] that in a set all elements are "distinct, but indistinguishable". Lawvere argues that this and Cantor's original notion of _[[cardinality]]_ is captured by the [[adjoint modality]] given by [[flat modality]] $\dashv$ [[sharp modality]]. 

This seems to match well with [[Hegel]]'s _[Pure quantity](Science+of+Logic#PureQuantity)_ both informally as well as formally (as discussed there).

Notice that where the English translations of [[Hegel]]'s _[[Science of Logic]]_ say "the One", the original has "Das Eins", which might just as well be translated with "The Unit". In view of this and looking through Hegel's piece on discreteness and repulsion, it seems clear that Hegel's "Einsen" is precisely Cantor's "Einsen" as recalled by Lawvere. Namely: copies of the [[unit type]].

Notice that the German "lauter" is pretty much the English "lots of". When you say "A lot o\'" as in the slang "A lot o\' stuff" or else say "lauter" with a Bavarian accent, it comes out pretty much alike.

On page 7, Lawvere makes the distinction between _objective_ and _subjective_ cohesion. The subjective version involve the "coming to know" aspects of points in a space. "A good example of a type of set possessing subjective cohesion is that of recursive set, which is 'traced' by various threads generated by particular recursive functions." 

In view of the relationship between cohesion and modality, Lawvere's distinction should correspond to that between metaphysical and epistemic modalities ("As far as I know, it may be the case that...").

On page 11, Lawvere discusses categories intermediate between the original cohesive category and the base. This relates to the discussion, pp. 10-11 of [[Some Thoughts on the Future of Category Theory]], which remarks on dimensional levels of increasing determinateness, including infinitesimal increases.
