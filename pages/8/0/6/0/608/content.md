## Definition 

A **simplicial object in  $Cat$** is a [[simplicial object]], [[internalization|in]] to the [[1-category]] [[Cat]] of [[categories]] and [[functors]] between them, equivalently an [[internal category]] [[internalization|in]] [[sSet]].

This would deserve to be and sometimes is called a *[[simplicial category]]*, but more often the latter terminology is used to refer to [[simplicially enriched categories]] only (which may be regarded as the special case of simplicial objects in $Cat$ whose simplicial set of objects happens to be simplicially constant).
