## Idea

In the context of the [[quantization of Yang-Mills theory]], the _mass gap problem_ is the question of why the [[bound states]] of massless [[quarks]] ([[hadrons]]) have [[mass]]. A solution is necessary to explain why the [[strong nuclear force]] is strong but short-ranged.

### Phenomenology
 {#Phenomenology}

In the application of [[QCD]] to [[particle physics]] [[phenomenology]], the mass gap problem is incarnated in the open problem of demonstrating [[confinement]] of [[quarks]] at low energies to colour-neutral [[bound states]], hence to [[hadrons]]/[[baryons]] (hence the existence of ordinary [[matter]]!).  There does exist some qualitative understanding as well as computer simulations in [[lattice QCD]], but there remain fundamental issues with deriving basic properties of [[hadrons]] such as their [[mass]] (e.g. [Kutschke 96, Section 3.1](#Kutschke96)) and [[spin]] (the "[[proton spin crisis]]").

This is widely and well known, but particle physics does not quite share the mathematician's culture of succinctly highlighting open problems. Here are some sources that make this explicit:

* {#Kutschke96} Robert Kutschke, section 3.1 _Heavy flavour spectroscopy_, in D. Bugg (ed.), _Hadron Spectroscopy and the Confinement Problem_, Proceedings of a NATO Advanced Study Institute, Plenum Press 1996  ([doi:10.1007/978-1-4613-0375-6](https://www.springer.com/cn/book/9780306453038))

> While it is generally believed that QCD is the correct fundamental theory of the strong interactions there are, as yet, no practical means to produce full QCD calculations of hadron masses and their decay widths.
