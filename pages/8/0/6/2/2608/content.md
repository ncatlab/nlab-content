[[!redirects S-Sch]]
$S/Sch$ is the category of [[S-scheme]]s and S-morphisms.


Zoran: I disagree, almost never used notation. It is more standard (both in algebraic geometry and in category theory) to write $Sch/S$, $Scheme/S$ or $Schemes/S$, and more rarely $Sch_S$, as it is just a [[slice category]].
