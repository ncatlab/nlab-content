## Idea

**Tambara functors** are algebraic structures similar to [[Mackey functors]], but with multiplicative norm maps as well as additive transfer maps, and a rule governing their interaction. They were introduced by Tambara, as TNR-functors, to encode the relationship between Trace (additive transfer), Norm (multiplicative transfer) and Restriction maps in the representation theory and cohomology theory of finite groups ([Tam93](#Tam93)).

>A Mackey functor is represented by a "$G$-equivariant Eilenberg&#8211;MacLane spectrum", ... a Tambara functor is represented by a commutative "$G$-equivariant Eilenberg-MacLane ring spectrum" ([AB15](#AB15))

## Examples

Burnside rings, representation rings, zeroth stable homotopy group of a genuine equivariant $E_{\infty}$-ring.

>the homotopy category of Eilenberg MacLane commutative ring spectra is equivalent to the category of Tambara functors. ([Ull13](#Ull13))

Some other examples are related to [[Witt-Burnside functors]], Witt rings in the sense of Dress and Siebeneicher.
