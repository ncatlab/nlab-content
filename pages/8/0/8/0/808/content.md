A **connection** can mean

* [[connection on a cubical set]]

* [[connection for a differential graded algebra]]

* __connection on a bundle__ which can be introduced in several very different but equivalent formalisms: as a [[connection on a bundle|parallel transport]] functor, as a rule for __covariant derivative__, as a __distribution (field) of horizontal subspaces__ (see [[Ehresmann connection]]) and via a __connection 1-form__ which annihilates the distribution of horizontal subspaces. The connection in that sense induces a smooth version of [[Hurewicz connection]]. The usual textbook convention is to say just connection for the distribution of horizontal subspaces, and the objects of the other three approaches call more specifically covariant derivative, connection 1-form and parallel transport.
