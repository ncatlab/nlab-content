## Idea

In [[chemistry]] a type of [[atom]] is called a _chemical element_. The [[bound states]] of these are the [[molecules]].

The _[[atomic number]]_ of a [[chemical element]] is the [[natural number|number]] of [[protons]] in any [[atomic nuclei]] of this element.

The corresponding [[natural number|number]] of [[neutrons]] on the nucleus tends to be close to the number of protons, hence to the atomic number of the element, but need not equal it and my differ considerably for heavy elements. These variants of neutron number for give atomic number specify the _[[isotopes]]_ of the chemical element.

The [[periodic table of the elements]] organizes the elements according to their [[atomic number]]. This behaviour is explained by the [[quantum physics]] of [[atoms]]. This transition area between [[quantum physics]] and [[chemistry]] is called [[quantum chemistry]].

## Examples

* [[carbon]]

* [[nitrogen]]
