Given a connection on a principal $G$-[[principal bundle|bundle]] $P\to M$ the __holonomy Lie algebra__ at a point $p$ in a total space principal bundle $P$ is the tangent Lie algebra of the [[holonomy group]] at $p$ of a principal $G$-bundle. By the __Ambrose-Singer theorem__ the holonomy Lie algebra is spanned as a vector subspace of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ of $G$ spanned by all elements $\Omega_q(X,Y)$ where $q$ is a point in $P$ connected to $q$ by some horizontal path and $X,Y\in H_q P\subset T_q P$ are horizontal vectors at $q$.
