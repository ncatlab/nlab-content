## Idea

This entry discusses the [[quantization]] of the [[prequantum field theory|prequantum]] data of standard 3d [[Chern-Simons theory]] (induced from a suitable [[Lie group]] and [[invariant polynomial]]/[[second Chern class]] [[action functional]]) to a [[3d TQFT]].

The steps involved in the [[geometric quantization]] of [[Chern-Simons theory]] are indicated at _[Chern-Simons theory -- Geometic quantization](Chern-Simons+theory#GeometricQuantization)_.

It was long expected that the resulting [[3d TQFT]] is that given by the [[Reshetikhin-Turaev model]], which is a kind of state sum model that produces an [[FQFT]] from the data of a [[modular tensor category]], such as the category of [[positive energy representations]] of the [[loop group]] of $G$, or else of a [[quantum group]]. 

More recently all the ingredients of a proof that this is indeed equivalently the result of the [[geometric quantization]] are appearing ([Andersen 12](#Andersen12)). See also ([MO discussion](#MODiscussion)).

Explicit proof that in particular the [[modular functor]] in the [[Reshetikhin-Turaev model]] is equivalent to that induced from [[geometric quantization]] is at least partially in
