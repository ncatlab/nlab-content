## Idea
 {#Idea}

This entry discusses the full ([[non-perturbative quantum field theory|non-perturbative]]) [[quantization]] of the [[prequantum field theory|prequantum]] data of standard 3d [[Chern-Simons theory]] (induced from a suitable [[Lie group]] and [[invariant polynomial]]/[[second Chern class]] [[action functional]]) to a [[3d TQFT]].

(For the [[perturbative QFT|perturbative quantization]] of [[Chern-Simons theory]] see [there](Chern-Simons+theory#PerturbativeQuantization)).

Existing literature knows three sectors of this problem, which overlap but do not coincide

1. [[path integral quantization]]. This may be made precise sense of in [[perturbation theory]] where it involves lots of interesting structure such as [[analytic torsion]] ([Witten 89](Chern-Simons#theory#Witten89)). However, being just [[perturbation theory]] it is just an approximation to the full answer.

1. [[geometric quantization]] yields the full (non-perturbative quantization) in [[codimension]] 1, but does not say anything about codimension 0.

1. The [[Reshetikhin-Turaev construction]] produces a [[3d TQFT]] from algebraic data that is naturally associated with the prequantum data defining Chern-Simons theory (such as the category of [[positive energy representations]] of the [[loop group]] of the given [[gauge group]] $G$, or else of a [[quantum group]] [Sawin 06](#Sawin06)), but it is not a priori clear that this 3d quantum field theory is genuinely the result of quantizing the Chern-Simons [[action functional]].

The known relation between the second and the third point here is the following:

That the complex-geometric [[modular functor]] obtained from [[geometric quantization]] of Chern-Simons theory as in ([Axelrod-Pietra-Witten 91](#AxelrodPietraWitten91), [Hitchin 90](#Hitchin90)) coincides with that of [[conformal blocks]] of the [[WZW model]] was shown in ([Laszlo 98](#Laszlo98),see also [Andersen 11](#Andersen11), [Andersen 12](#Andersen12)).
That this in turn indeed satisfies the required [[sewing law]] (and hence really is a modular functor in the strong sense) was shown in ([Tsuchiya-Ueno-Yamada](#TsuchiyaUenoYamada)). By [deprojectivization](modular%20functor#TopologicalLift) these constructions yield a topological modular functor of the form also obtained from the [[Reshetikhin-Turaev construction]].

These (topological) modular functors are fixed by their [[genus]]-0 data ([Andersen-Ueno 06](#AndersenUeno06)) which is equivalently the datum of a (weakly) [[modular tensor category]]. Hence for matching [[geometric quantization]] of 3d Chern-Simons theory to the [[Reshetikhin-Turaev construction]] one has to match the [[modular tensor categories]] obtained from the [[conformal blocks]] of the [[WZW model]] in genus-0 to that associated with the coresponding [[quantum groups]]. This works ([Ostrik 14](#Ostrik14)).

## Something more

> random notes, needs to be brought into shape

### Space of Chern-Simons quantum states 

Chern-Simons [[action functional]]

$$
  \exp(\tfrac{i}{\hbar}S_{CS}) \colon \mathbf{Fields}_{CS} \longrightarrow \mathbf{B}^{n+1} U(1)_{conn}
$$

given a [[closed manifold]] $\Sigma_n$ then choice of [[complex structure]] $\mathbf{\Sigma}_n$ on $\Sigma_n$ is supposed to naturally induce a [[complex structure]] on the space of (on-shell) fields over $\Sigma_n$

$$
  \mathbf{Fields}_{CS}(\mathbf{\Sigma}_n)
$$

Moreover, [[transgression]] of $\exp(\tfrac{i}{\hbar}S)$ to $\mathbf{Fields}_{CS}(\Sigma)$ is supposed to yield a [[holomorphic line bundle]] with connection with respect to that complex structure

$$
  \exp(\tfrac{i}{\hbar}S(\mathbf{\Sigma}_n))
  \colon
  \mathbf{Fields}_{CS}(\mathbf{\Sigma}_n)
  \longrightarrow
  \mathbf{B}U(1)_{conn} 
  \,.
$$

This is the [[prequantum line bundle]] of the Chern-Simons theory, already equipped with a [[KÃ¤hler polarization]].

Accordingly, the [[geometric quantization]] of the CS action functional assigns to $\Sigma_n$ the [[Hilbert space]] $\mathcal{H}_{\mathbf{\Sigma}}$ of holomorphic sections of $\exp(\tfrac{i}{\hbar}S(\mathbf{\Sigma}_n))$.

As the complex structure $\mathbf{\Sigma}_n$ on $\Sigma_n$ varies over the [[moduli stack of complex structures]] $\mathcal{M}_{\Sigma}$, these vector spaces $\mathcal{H}_{\mathbf{\Sigma}_n}$ form a [[vector bundle]] with projective flat connection (the _[[Hitchin connection]]_) on the moduli stack

$$
  \array{
    \mathcal{H}
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    \mathcal{M}_{\Sigma}
  }
$$

The assignment

$$
  \Sigma_n \mapsto \mathcal{H}_{\Sigma}
$$

natural in [[diffeomorphisms]] of $\Sigma$ is called the _[[modular functor]]_, this we focus on more [below](#ModularFunctorAndEquivariantEllipticCohomology)


One such section $\Psi$ is to be singled out. For instance if $\exp(\tfrac{i}{\hbar}S(\Sigma_n))$ is a [[theta characteristic]] then there is up to scale a unique holomorphic section. This singling-out is formalized by the [[FRS-formalism]]. See there for more.

### Space of WZW-model pre-correlators 

Under the [[AdS3-CFT2 and CS-WZW correspondence]] the states of Chern-Simons theory also correspond to [[partition functions]] of the [[gauged WZW model]] and hence to [[generating functions]] for [[correlation functions]] of the actual [[WZW model]].

The [[field (physics)|fields]] $\mathbf{Fields}(\Sigma_n)$ may also be thought of as the [[sources]] of a (higher) [[gauged WZW model]] on $\Sigma$. 

The [[holographic principle]] says that the [[quantum state]]/[[wavefunction]] 

$$
  \Psi \in \Gamma(\mathbf{Fields}_{CS}(\mathbf{\Sigma}_n), L)
$$ 

is also the [[generating function]] for the [[correlators]] of the [[WZW model]] on $\Sigma_n$, meaning that its [[functional derivatives]] 

+-- {: bluebox}

$$
  \frac{\delta}{\delta A^{a_1}(z_1)}
  \cdots 
  \frac{\delta}{\delta A^{a_n}(z_n)}
  \Psi
  =
  \left\langle J^{a_1}(z_1) \cdots J^{a_n}(z_n) \right\rangle
$$

=--

with respect to the Chern-Simons-[[field (physics)|fields]], hence the WZW [[sources]],  are the [[n-point functions]] of the WZW model for [[current algebra]] insertions, as indicated


(e.g. [Gaw&#281;dzki 99 (4.23), 5.1](#Gawedzki99))



### Modular functor and equivariant elliptic cohomology
 {#ModularFunctorAndEquivariantEllipticCohomology}

Discussion of [[equivariant elliptic cohomology]] (see there at _[interpretation in QFT](equivariant+elliptic+cohomology#InterpretationInQuantumFieldTheory)_) shows that the construction of the [[modular functor]] refines from equipping $\Sigma$ with [[complex structure]] to equipping it with [[arithmetic geometry|arithmetic structure]]. Hence for $\Sigma$ a [[torus]] it refines from structures of [[elliptic curves]] over the complex numbers to general arithmetic elliptic curves (over the [[integers]]) and in fact to [[derived elliptic curves]] (over the [[sphere spectrum]]). Hence eventually the theory of [[geometric quantization]] needs to be refined to admit [[polarizations]] in [[arithmetic geometry]]. See at _[[differential cohesion and idelic structure]]_ for more on this.
