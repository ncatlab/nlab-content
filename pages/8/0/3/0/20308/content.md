## Definition

Given a [[topological space]] $X$, then a set of [[subsets]] $\{S_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ is _countably locally discrete_ or _$\sigma$-locally discrete_ if it is a countable union of [[locally discrete set of subsets|locally discrete sets of subsets]].

Note that [[open covers of metric spaces have open countably locally discrete refinements]].

## Example

* Every [[metrisable topological space]] admits a [[topological base|base]] which is $\sigma$-locally discrete, see [[open covers of metric spaces have open countably locally discrete refinements]].
