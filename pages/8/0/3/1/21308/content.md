## Idea 
 {#Idea}

**Condensed mathematics** aims to provide a more convenient framework in which to treat [[algebra|algebraic]] objects which are equipped with a [[topological space|topology]], such as [[topological abelian groups]] or [[topological vector spaces]]. Related aims are to turn [[functional analysis]] into a branch of [[commutative algebra]], and various types of [[analytic geometry]] into [[algebraic geometry]].

For instance, the [[category]] of [[topological abelian groups]] is not [[abelian category|abelian]], which means for instance that it lacks a good theory of [[exact sequences]]. 
But the category of [[condensed abelian groups]] is [[abelian category|abelian]] and it contains topological abelian groups as a [[full subcategory]] (under appropriate conditions, see [ScholzeLCM](#ScholzeLCM), Proposition 1.7).

According to [[Peter Scholze]] in [this comment on the nCaf√©](https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2020/03/pyknoticity_versus_cohesivenes.html#c057780), current expositions of condensed mathematics rely heavily on the [[axiom of choice]] and choice-like axioms such as the [[presentation axiom]], so it is unknown how much they still hold in the context of more [[constructive mathematics]] without choice. 

## Concepts

### Condensed objects

* [[condensed set]]

* [[condensed abelian group]]

* [[condensed ring]]

* [[condensed module]]


#### Solid objects

* [[solid abelian group]]

* [[solid module]]

* [[solidification functor]]

* [[solid spectrum]]


#### Liquid objects

* [[liquid vector space]]

* [[liquid module]]


#### Other

* [[trace-class map]]

* [[nuclear module]]

* [[analytic ring]]


### Higher condensed objects

* [[condensed infinity-groupoid]]

* [[condensed object in an (infinity,1)-category]]

* [[condensed spectrum]]

* [[condensed E-infinity ring]]

* [[condensed module spectrum]]

## Applications

The theory of solid modules was used to formulate the correct theory of $\ell$-adic sheaves for the geometrization of the [[local Langlands correspondence]] by Fargues and Scholze ([FarguesScholze21](#FarguesScholze21)). It has also been used by Mann to formalize the [[six operations]] for [[rigid analytic geometry]] ([Mann22](#Mann22)).

Condensed mathematics has also been used in [ClausenScholze22](#ClausenScholze22) to provide new "analysis-free" proofs of the finiteness of [[coherent cohomology]], [[Serre duality]], [[GAGA]], and the [[Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch theorem]] in [[complex analysis]].
