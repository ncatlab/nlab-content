This entry is about the textbook

* [[Leonardo Castellani]], [[Riccardo D'Auria]], [[Pietro Fre]], _Supergravity and Superstrings - A Geometric Perspective_

on [[supergravity]] with an emphasis on the [[D'Auria-Fre formulation of supergravity]].

At the time of this writing the book is out of print and unavailable from bookshops. But your local physics department library may have a copy.


## Further references

The original article that introduced th D'Auria-Fr&#233;-formalism is

* **geSuGra** R. D'Auria, P. Fr&#233; _Geometric supergravity in $D = 11$ and its hidden supergroup_ [[GeometricSupergravity.pdf:file]]
 
The _geometric perspective_ discussed there is both the emphasis of working over base [[supermanifold]]s and combined with that the the approach that here we call tthe _D'Auria-Fr&#233;-formalism_ . 

The interpretation of the D'Auria-Fr&#233;-formalism in terms of [[∞-Lie algebra valued forms]] together with a discussion of the [[supergravity Lie 3-algebra]] in the context of [[String Lie 2-algebra|String Lie n-algebra]]s was given in 

* [[Hisham Sati]], [[Urs Schreiber]], [[Jim Stasheff]], _$L_\infty$-algebra connections_ (<a href="http://ncatlab.org/schreiber/show/differential+cohomology+in+an+(%E2%88%9E%2C1)-topos+--+references#SSSI">web</a>)

This had been preceded by some blog discussion, for instance

* [[Urs Schreiber]], _Castellani on FDA in SuGra: gauge 3-group of M-theory_ ([blog](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/string/archives/000840.html))

This is, as far as [[Urs Schreiber|I]] am aware, the first occurence of the explicit observation that the FDA-formalism is about higher gauge theory, based on hearing a talk on

* [[Leonardo Castellani]], _Lie derivatives along antisymmetric tensors, and the M-theory superalgebra_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0508213))

* [[Urs Schreiber]], _SuGra 3-connection reloaded_ ([blog](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2006/08/sugra_3connection_reloaded.html))

Apart from that the first vague mention of the observation that the "FDA"-formalism for supergravity is about higher categorical Lie algebras (as far as [[Urs Schreiber|I]] am aware, would be grateful for further references) is page 2 of

* [[Pietro Fre]], [[Pietro Antonio Grassi]], _Free differential algebras, rheonomy and pure spinors_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.3076))
