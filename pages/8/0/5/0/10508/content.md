## Idea

Often a ([[smooth function|smooth]]) [[function]] on an [[infinite-dimensional manifold]] (or on a more general [[smooth space]]) is called a _functional_. A central example are the _[[action functionals]]_ in [[physics]].

To distibguish from the specifically [[linear functionals]] in [[functional analysis]], one might speak here of _nonlinear functionals_. However, in practice the context is usually understood and the adjective "nonlinear" is rarely used explicitly.
