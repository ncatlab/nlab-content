_Categories Work_ is a book on [[category theory]] by Saunders Mac Lane.

The full title is _Categories for the Working Mathematician_; the 2nd edition was published in 1997.

_Categories Work_ is the standard reference for category theory, and we may often cite it here. Almost all of its terminology is widely adopted, although strangely its approach to [[foundations]] is not.
