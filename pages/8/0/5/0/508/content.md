_Categories Work_ is the standard reference for category theory, and we may often cite it here. Almost all of its terminology is widely adopted, although its approach to [[foundations]] (one [[Grothendieck universe]]) is not as widely used (see [discussion](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Mathforge/nForum/comments.php?DiscussionID=1897) at nForum).
