> &lbrack;p. 103:&rbrack; "The multiple examples, here and elsewhere, of [[adjoint functors]] tend to show that adjoints occur almost everywhere in many branches of [[mathematics|Mathematics]]. It is the thesis of this book that a systematic use of all these [[adjunctions]] illuminates and clarifies these subjects."
