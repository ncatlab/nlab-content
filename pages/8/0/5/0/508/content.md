which is a classical textbook on [[category theory]].

The iconic title probably refers to the declared ambition of demonstrating the prevalence of examples of [[adjoint functors]] occurring throughout [[mathematics]]:

> &lbrack;p. 2:&rbrack; "[[adjoint functor|Adjoints]], as we shall see, occur throughout [[mathematics]]."

> &lbrack;p. 103:&rbrack; "The multiple examples, here and elsewhere, of [[adjoint functors]] tend to show that adjoints occur almost everywhere in many branches of [[mathematics|Mathematics]]. It is the thesis of this book that a systematic use of all these [[adjunctions]] illuminates and clarifies these subjects."
