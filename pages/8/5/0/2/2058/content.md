## Idea 

One says -- at least in the context of [[Giraud's axioms]] for [[topos]]es and [[(∞,1)-toposes]]) -- that _[[colimit]]s are universal_ in a context in which they are _stable under [[pullback]]_. This is described in more detail at [[commutativity of limits and colimits]].

The statement "colimits are universal" is then one of [[Giraud's axiom]]s that characterize [[Grothendieck topos]]es in the [[category theory|1-categorical context]] and Grothendieck-Rezk-Lurie [[(∞,1)-topos]]es in the [[higher category theory|higher categorical context]].
