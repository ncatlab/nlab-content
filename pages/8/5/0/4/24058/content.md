## Idea

Solid abelian groups are objects which form the basis of non-archimedean analysis in certain approaches to mathematics, such as [[condensed mathematics]]. 

## Definition

### As a functor

A ***solid abelian group*** is an [[additive functor]] from the category of [[free abelian groups]] to the category of [[abelian groups]]. 

This definition is due to [[Dustin Clausen]] [here](https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2020/03/pyknoticity_versus_cohesivenes.html#c057781). 

### In terms of condensed abelian groups

Let $S = \underset{\leftarrow}{\lim}_i S_i$ be a [[profinite set]], and define the [[condensed abelian group]] $\mathbb{Z}[S]^\square \coloneqq \underset{\leftarrow}{\lim}_i \mathbb{Z}[S_i]$, where $\mathbb{Z}[T]$ is the [[free abelian group]] on the set $T$. There is a natural map $m:S \to \mathbb{Z}[S]^\square$ which induces a map $\mathbb{Z}[S] \to \mathbb{Z}[S]^\square$. 

A **solid abelian group** is a condensed abelian group $A$ such that for all profinite sets $S$ and all maps $f:S \to A$, there is a unique map $g:\mathbb{Z}[S]^\square \to A$ such that $f = g \circ m$. 

## Properties

According to [[Peter Scholze]] in [this comment on the nCaf√©](https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2020/03/pyknoticity_versus_cohesivenes.html#c057780) in the absense of the [[presentation axiom]], the category of solid abelian groups is not a condensed category.
