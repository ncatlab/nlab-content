The _homotopy hypothesis_ states $n$-groupoids model homotopy $n$-types. As a slogan:

* $\infty$-groupoids are combinatorial models for spaces.

To some extent the homotopy hypothesis is not a hypothesis but a _requirement_ on the definition of [[infinity-groupoid]]: for every "good" deifnition of $\infty$-groupoid there should be an "obvious" morphism from the collection of all $\infty$-groupoids to (well behaved) topological spaces, and this map should be an equivalence in a "suitable" sense.

#Remarks#

* In analogy to the homotopy hypothesis, there are attempts to related general [[infinity-category|infinity-categories]] which need not be groupoidal to [[directed space]]s, in which a morphism which is not invertible would model a path in the space that can only be traversed in one direction.
