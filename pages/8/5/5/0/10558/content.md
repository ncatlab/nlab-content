__Ore domain__ is an [[integral domain]] (unital ring without zero divisors) $R$ in which the set $R^\times$ of all nonzero elements is an Ore set. Thus one can form the [[Ore localization]] $R[(R^\times)^{-1}]$ which is then a [[skew-field]] (division ring), called the Ore quotient ring (Ore quotient (skew)field). As Ore localizations of domains always do, it comes with a map $R\to R[(R^\times)^{-1}]$ which is 1-1. For most purposes, one sided Ore condition is sufficient, hence one considers also the weaker notions of left and right Ore domains.
