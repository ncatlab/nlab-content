## Idea

A *complete Heyting algebra* is a [[Heyting algebra]] which is also a [[complete lattice]]; that is, it is a [[poset]] with arbitrary [[limits]] and [[colimits]], that is also [[cartesian closed]].

## Properties

### Relation to frames

By the [[adjoint functor theorem]], one can demonstrate that every [[frame]] is a complete Heyting algebra, and vice versa, so far as the underlying [[poset]] goes.  

However, [[morphisms]] of frames needn't preserve [[exponential objects]] or infinitary [[meets]], as would most naturally be required of morphisms of complete Heyting algebras.  Also, when considering *[[large category|large]]* lattices which are only *small*-[[complete category|complete]], then frames and complete Heyting algebras are different objects.
