A complete Heyting algebra is a [[Heyting algebra]] which is also a [[complete lattice]]; that is, it is a [[poset]] with arbitrary [[limits]] and [[colimits]], which is also [[cartesian closed]].

By the [[adjoint functor theorem]], one can demonstrate that every [[frame]] is a complete Heyting algebra, and vice versa, so far as the underlying [[poset]] goes. However, morphisms of frames needn't preserve exponentials or infinitary meets, as would most naturally be required of morphisms of complete Heyting algebras.
