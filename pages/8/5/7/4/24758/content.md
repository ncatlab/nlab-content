## Definition

The *support* $[X]$ of any set $X$ is the [[image]] of the unique function into any [[singleton]] $X \to 1$. By definition of [[image]] the support is thus a [[subsingleton]], and a [[singleton]] if $X$ is pointed. Note that this is different from the [[support of a function|support of the unique function]] $X \to 1$, which is always the [[empty set]] $\emptyset$.

## Generalizing to other categories

The above definition could be interpreted not just in [[Set]] but in any [[category]] with a [[terminal object]]. This leads to the notions of a [[support object]]. 

The [[support object]] of an [[object]] $A$ of a [[category]] is the [[image]] of its map to the [[terminal object]]. In the [[internal logic]] of a category, this corresponds to the [[propositional truncation]].
