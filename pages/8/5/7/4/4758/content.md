# Strict $2$-groupoids
* table of contents

## Idea

The general notion of [[2-groupoid]] is also called _weak $2$-groupoid_ to distinguish from the special case of strict $2$-groupoids.


## Definitions

A __strict $2$-groupoid__ is equivalently:

*  a [[strict 2-category]] in which all morphisms are strictly invertible.
*  a [[Grpd]]-[[enriched category]].
*  a [[2-groupoid]] that is a [[strict 2-category]].
*  a [[strict omega-groupoid]] that is $2$-[[truncated]].


## Properties

This is a [[strict omega-groupoid]] in which all [[k-morphism]]s for $k \gt 2$ are [[identities]]. This is equivalently a [[crossed complex]] of the form $(G_2 \to G_1 \stackrel{\to}{\to} G_0)$.

Strict $2$-groupoids embed into all $2$-groupoids (modeled by [[bigroupoids]]) by regarding a strict $2$-category as a special case of a [[bicategory]].

They embed into all $2$-groupoids modeled as [[Kan complex]]es via the [[omega-nerve]].
