By an *integral form* (short for *integral differential form*) one many mean:

* in plain **[[differential geometry]]**:

  a [[differential form]] whose [[periods]] are [[integers]]; 
  
  hence a [[closed differential form]] whose class in [[de Rham cohomology]] is in the [[image]], under the [[de Rham isomorphism]], of a class in [[integral cohomology]].

* in differential **[[supergeometry]]**:

  a [[differential form on a supermanifold]] for which there is a notion of [[integration over supermanifolds]].
