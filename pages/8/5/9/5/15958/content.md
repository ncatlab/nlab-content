## Overview

Many results on arithmetic or automorphic [[zeta functions]] and [[L-functions]] are obtained by using the fact that their zeroes and poles may be seen as the spectrum of an operator acting either on a given [[geometric cohomology]] theory (in arithmetic geometry) or on a given [[topological vector space]] (in the automorphic theory).

For example, the functional equation is often proved by using an equivariant pairing on the space that gives the spectral interpretation (Poincar&#233; duality in arithmetic geometry and Poisson summation formula in the automorphic theory).

The finite characteristic analog of the Riemann hypothesis was also proved, following the [[Weil conjectures]], by the use of a kind of geometric Fourier duality result, in Laumon's approach.

## Challenges

The main challenge is to find a [[geometric cohomology]] theory for strict [[global analytic spaces]] over $\mathb{Z}$ (with its archimedean norm) that will allow the spectral interpretation of zeroes and poles of motivic L-functions. It may also be interesting to propose a similar definition for non-strict [[global analytic spaces]], in order to get a unified treatment of the finite characteristic case (seen as a theory of derived overconvergent analytic spaces over $\mathbb{Z}_p$) and the global case (of flat regular schemes over $\mathbb{Z}$).
