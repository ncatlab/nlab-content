## Idea

Cauchy's integral theorem states that [[contour integrals]] of [[holomorphic functions]], in any [[simply connected space|simply connected]] [[subspace]] of the [[complex plane]], are invariant under [[homotopy]] of paths.


## Statement

Let $\gamma_1,\gamma_2$ be two homotopic [[loop|loops]] in a [[simply connected]] open subset $D\subseteq \mathbb{C}$. Let $f$ be a holomorphism on $D$. Then we have

$$ \int_{\gamma_1} f(z) \,\mathrm{d}z = \int_{\gamma_2} f(z) \,\mathrm{d}z $$

In particular we have 

$$ \int_{\gamma_1} f(z) \,\mathrm{d}z = 0 $$

for $\gamma_2 \coloneqq 0$.
