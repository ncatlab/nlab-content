## Idea

A [[setoid]] or [[Bishop set]] whose [[quotient set]] is an [[Archimedean ordered field]]. 

“Archimedean ordered field setoid” and "Bishop Archimedean ordered field" are placeholder names for a concept which may or may not have another name in the mathematics literature. 

## Definition

Given any [[ordered field setoid]] $F$, there exists a ring setoid homomorophism $h$ from the [[rational numbers]] $\mathbb{Q}$ to $F$. This setoid homomorphism is also an [[injection]], which implies that one can suppress the homomorphism via [[coercion]], such that given $q \in \mathbb{Q}$ one can derive that $q \in F$. 

Then, an [[ordered field setoid]] $F$ is **Archimedean** if for all elements $x \in F$ and $y \in F$, if $x \lt y$, then there exists a rational number $q \in \mathbb{Q}$ such that $x \lt q$ and $q \lt y$. 

## Properties

* Every Archimedean ordered field setoid is a [[pseudometric space]]. 

## Examples

* Given any [[Archimedean ordered field]] $F$, the set of [[Cauchy sequences]] in $F$ is an Archimedean ordered field setoid. 

* Given any [[Archimedean ordered field]] $F$, the set of all [[locators]] of all elements of $F$ is an Archimedean ordered field setoid.
