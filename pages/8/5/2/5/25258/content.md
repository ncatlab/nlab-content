## Definition

The __Stein site__ is a [[site]] that has [[Stein manifolds]] as objects, [[holomorphic maps]] as morphisms,
and good Stein covers as [[covering families]].

Here a good Stein cover is an [[open cover]] whose finite intersections are themselves [[Stein manifolds]].

The Stein site is [[hypercomplete]] and has enough points (in the stronger sense of [[(âˆž,1)-toposes]]).
