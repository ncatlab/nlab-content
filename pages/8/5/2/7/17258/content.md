## Idea

**Kinship** is the relation that obtains between persons related by real or fictive consanguinity. The organisation of these in systems of marriage and kinship play an important and prominent role for society as whole. In particular in pre-industrial societies, these tend to be cast into rigid and intricate patterns that are a preferred playground for applications of mathematics to anthropology ever since [[André Weil]] contributed an algebraic appendix to [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Claude Lévi-Strauss']] groundbreaking [_Les structures &#233;l&#233;mentaires de la parent&#233;_](#LS67).

### Permutation models

It is generally assumed that all societies explicitly impose some restrictions on the types of possible marriages. The resulting kinship systems then differ whether these restrictions take on the form of prohibitions like e.g. in modern societies that merely ban certain marriages due to considerations of affinity or age, or the form of prescriptions that specify positively to marry into a determinate 'marriage class' or category of kins.

The latter prescriptive systems have been called _elementary structures_ by L&#233;vi-Strauss and further divided into systems of _restricted exchange_ where two groups $A,B$ directly exchange spouses, or systems of _generalized exchange_ with longer cycles of exchange e.g. group $A$ gives spouses to $B$ that gives spouses to $C$ that gives spouses to $A$.

Since marriages become deterministic on the classes, elementary kinship systems are amenable to analysis via permutations on the set of marriage classes. This group-theoretic modeling of elementary structures has been pioneered by [[André Weil]] ([1949](#Weil49)) and later been systematized by Philippe Courr&#232;ge.

###### Definition 

An _(elementary) kinship system_ is a triple $(S,\omega,\mu)$ where $S$ is a finite set, and $\omega,\mu$ are permutations of $S$.

A _morphism of kinship systems_ $(S_1,\omega_1,\mu_1)\to (S_2,\omega_2,\mu_2)$ is a function $f:S_1\to S_2$ that is equivariant with respect to $\omega$ and $\mu$ i.e. $f\circ\omega_1 =\omega_2\circ f$ and $f\circ\mu_1 =\mu_2\circ f$.

The resulting [[category]] $\mathcal{K}$ is called the _category of kinship (systems)_.

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark
The axiomatics was proposed in [Courr&#232;ge (1965)](#Cour65) with the intended interpretation that $S$ represents the _set of (disjoint) marriage classes_, that the _conjugal_ function $\omega$ links the men in class $x$ to the class $\omega (x)$ that contains their wifes ('_men in $x$ marry women in $\omega (x)$_') and that the _matrilineal_ function $\mu$ links the mothers in class $x$ to the class $\mu (x)$ that contains their children ('_women in $x$ have children in $\mu(x)$_').

One can then define a _patrilineal_ function[^termin] $\pi:$$=\mu\circ\omega$ that links the fathers in $x$ to their children in $\mu(\omega (x))$ ('_men in $x$ have children in $\mu(\omega (x))$_').

Since a kinship structure $(S,\omega,\mu)$ contains an element $\omega$ of '_alliance_' and an element $\mu$ of '_descent_' one could view the axiomatics as a reconciliation of the Anglo-Saxon tradition in kinship studies that stressed descent and L&#233;vi-Strauss' views that stressed alliance. But this 'reconciliation' is more one of appearances as one could equally well use $\pi$ and $\mu$ as undefined terms and define $\omega =\mu^{-1}\circ \pi$.

[^termin]: $\mu$ and $\pi$ are called the _maternal_ resp. _paternal_ function in Courr&#232;ge (1965).

+-- {: .num_defn #kinship}
###### Definition 
Given a system of kinship $(S,\omega,\mu)$, the subgroup $G$ of $Aut(S)$ generated by $\omega$ and $\mu$ is called the _group of kinship terms_ of $(S,\omega,\mu)$. The system $(S,\omega,\mu)$ is called _regular_ when the natural action of $G$ on $S$ is free and transitive i.e. :

1. For all $g\in G$: if $g\neq 1$ then $gx\neq x$ for all $x\in S$.

1. For all $x,y\in S$ there is a $g\in G$ such that $gx=y$.

To equip a set $S$ with a kinship structure amounts to give a function $f:\{1,2\}\to |Aut(S)|$ that picks out $f(1)=\omega$ and $f(2)=\mu$ from the set |Aut(S)| of automorphisms of $S$. 
By the adjunction $F\dashv |\cdot|$ between the free-group functor $F:Set\to Grp$ and the underlying-set functor $|\cdot|: Grp\to Set$ this is the same as giving a group homorphism $\alpha: F(\{1,2\})\to Aut(S)$ from the [[free group]] on $\{1,2\}$, denoted $F_2$ in the following, to the group $Aut(S)$ of automorphisms of $S$, but this, in turn, is the same as giving an [[action]] of $F_2$ on the set $S$!

The group $G$ of kinship terms is none other than $im(\alpha)\subseteq Aut(S)$.

As this goes through regardless of whether $S$ is finite or not and makes sense with respect to the morphisms in $\mathcal{K}$ we have


+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The category $\mathcal{K}$ of kinship systems is equivalent to the [[topos]] of finite $F_2$-sets where $F_2$ is the [[free group]] on two generators. $\qed$

=--

An $F_2$-[[torsor]] is a [[flat functor]] $T:F_2\to Set$ which by definition amounts to a functor $T$ such that the [[category of elements]] $\int _{F_2} T$ is [[filtered category|filtered]]. (...)

### Topos-theoretic perspectives

Lawvere and Schanuel ([1997](#LawSchan97), [1999](#Law99)) proposed to study the concept of kinship starting from the notion of a (filiation structured) **society** modeled mathematically as a set $X$ (of _individuals_) together with two endofunctions $m,f$ that assign to an individual $x\in X$ his mother $m(x)\in X$ resp. his father $f(x)\in X$.

If one organizes these sets with filiation structure into a category the result is a [[topos]] namely the topos $Set^{M_2^{op}}$ of right actions of the free monoid $M_2$ on two symbols $\{m,f\}$.

Since the parental endofunctions $m,f$ are completely unconstrained[^Cour], the resulting 'kinship relations' are equally unconstrained, e.g. nothing prevents an individual's mother from coinciding with the same individual's father etc.  It therefore becomes necessary to equip the 'societies' with further structure. Lawvere and Schanuel propose to achieve this by introducing appropriate labeling objects $L$ and passage to the [[slice topos]] $Set^{M_2^{op}}/L$.

[^Cour]: so unconstrained indeed, that it might be better to think of the societies as being composed of 'sections' or 'marriage classes' instead of individuals and to think of $m,f$ as the assignment of the marriage classes  $m(x),f(x)$ of the respective parents of the individuals in the class $x$ in the spirit of [Courr&#232;ge (1965)](#Cour65). This has the drawback that it admits (hardly plausible) societies composed of infinitely many classes, whereas societies composed of (countably) infinitely-many individuals can be conceived of as an ideal self-image of a sucessful society projecting itself to eternity.

A minimal model of a society that at least keeps the **gender** of the parents apart is the set $G=\{female, male\}$ consisting of a 'female' and a distinct 'male' individual[^group] together with parental functions $m,f$ complying with the usual gender rules e.g. $m(female)=female$, $f(female)=male$ etc. Then a consistent gender distinction on the parental structure of an arbitrary society corresponds to a structure preserving map to $G$ i.e. an object of the slice topos $Set^{M_2^{op}}/G$.

[^group]: Again it makes more sense to consider $G$ to consist of two gender groups instead of two individuals.

Similarly, **exogamy** can be modeled by a _clans object_ $C$ e.g. consisting of two clans $C=\{bear, wolf\}$ obeying matrilinearity in the sense that the mother-of function $m$ is constant but the father-of function $f$ switches the clans expressing thereby that the father of an individual comes from another clan than the individual and his mother. By labeling with the product $G\times C$ one can achieve gender distinction and exogamy at the same time.
