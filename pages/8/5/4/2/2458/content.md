The [[noncommutative localization]] is a common term for several kinds of [[localization]] which occur in noncommutative [[ring theory]] and in particular the (left or right) [[Ore localization]], [[Gabriel localization]] and Cohn [[universal localization]] of rings and of their associated [[Mod|categories of modules]]. The language of [[torsion theory|torsion theories]] was originally developed also in this context, but in fact it can pertain to a more general situation than to the categories of modules over rings.
