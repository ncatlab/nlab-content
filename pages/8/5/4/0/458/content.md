## Idea and motivation

A _locale_ is, intuitively, like a [[topological space]] that may or may not have enough points (or even any points at all).  It contains things we call "open sets" but there may or may not be enough points to distinguish between open sets.  An "open set" in a locale can be regarded as conveying a bounded amount of information about the (hypothetical) points that it contains.  For example, there is a locale of all surjections from the natural numbers $N$ to the real numbers $R$.  It has no points, since there are no such surjections, but it contains many nontrivial "open sets;" these open sets are generated by a family parametrised by $n: N$ and $x: R$ that may be described as $\{f:N\to R | f$ is a surjection and  $f(n) = x\}$.

Every topological space can be regarded as a locale (with a little bit of lost information if the space is not [[sober space|sober]]). The locales arising this way are the [[topological locale]]s.  Conversely, every locale induces a topology on its set of points, but sometimes a great deal of information is lost; there are many different locales whose space of points is empty.  We say that a locale is _[[spatial locale|spatial]]_ if it can be recovered from its space of points.

One motivation for locales is that since they take the notion of "open set" as basic, with the points (if any) being a derived notion, they are exactly what is needed to define [[sheaf|sheaves]].  The notion of sheaf on a topological space only refers to the open sets, rather than the points, so it carries over word-for-word to a definition of sheaves on locales.  Moreover, passage from locales to their [[topos|toposes]] of sheaves is a [[full and faithful functor]], unlike for topological spaces.

Another advantage of locales is that they are better-behaved than topological spaces in [[constructive mathematics]] or [[internalization|internal]] to an arbitrary topos.  For example, constructively the topological space $[0,1]$ need not be [[compact space|compact]], but the _locale_ $[0,1]$ is always compact (in a suitable sense).  It follows that the locale $[0,1]$, and hence also the locale $R$ of real numbers, is not always spatial.  When it fails to be spatial, because there are "not enough real numbers," the locale is generally a better-behaved object than the topological space of real numbers.


## Definition

A **[[frame]]** $A$ is a [[partial order|poset]] with all [[join|joins]] and all finite [[meet|meets]] which satisfies the _infinite distributive law_:
$$ x \wedge (\bigvee_i y_i) = \bigvee_i (x\wedge y_i).$$
A **frame homomorphism** $\phi: A\to B$ is a function which preserves finite meets and arbitrary joins.  Frames and frame homomorphisms form a [[category]] [[Frm]].

Note: By the [[adjoint functor theorem]] (AFT) for posets, a frame also has all meets, but a frame homomorphism need not preserve them.  Again by the AFT, a frame is automatically a [[Heyting algebra]], but again a frame homomorphism need not preserve the [[Heyting implication]].

The [[category]] [[Locale]] of **locales** is the [[opposite category|opposite]] of the category of frames

$$
  Loc := Frm^{op}
  \,.
$$

That is, a locale $X$ "is" a frame, which we often write as $O(X)$ and call "the frame of open sets in $X$", and a **continuous map** $f:X\to Y$ of locales is a frame homomorphism $f^*:O(Y)\to O(X)$. If you think of a frame as an algebraic structure (a [[lattice]] satisfying a completeness condition), then this is an example of the [[duality]] of [[space and quantity]].

This category is naturally enhanced to a [[2-category]]:

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

The [[2-category]] [[Locale]] has

* as [[object]]s $X$ [[frame]]s $Op(X)$;

* as [[morphisms]] $f : X \to Y$ frame homomorphisms $f^* : Op(Y) \to Op(X)$;

* a unique [[2-morphisms]] $f \Rightarrow g$ whenever for all $U \in Op(Y)$ we have a (then necessarily unique) morphism $f^* U \to g^* U$.

=--

(For instance [Johnstone, C1.4, p. 514](#Johnstone).)

This [[2-category]] is in fact a [[(1,2)-category]]: a [[Poset]]-[[enriched category]].

## Properties

### Category of locales
 {#CategoryOfLocales}

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The category [[Locale]]$(E)$ of locales [[internalization|internal to]] a [[topos]] $E$ is equivalent to the category of [[localic geometric morphisms]] $Sh_{E}(\Sigma) \to E$ in [[Topos]].

$$
  Locale(E) \simeq (Topos/E)_{loc}
  \,.
$$

=--

See [[localic geometric morphism]] for more.

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

For every local $X \in $ [[Locale]] the category $Locale(Sh(X))$ of locales inernal to the [[sheaf topos]] over $X$ is equivalent to the [[overcategory]] $Locale/X$

$$
  \mathcal{I} : Locale/X \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} Locale(Sh(X)) 
  \,.
$$

=--

This appears as [Johnstone, theorem C1.6.3](#Johnstone).

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

For every morphism of locales $f : Y \to X$ the [[sheaf topos]] $Sh(Y)$ is equivalent as a topos over $Sh(X)$ to the topos $Sh_{Sh(X)}(\mathcal{I}(Y))$ of internal sheaves over the internal locale $\mathcal{I}(Y) \in Sh(X)$

$$
  Sh(Y) \simeq Sh_{Sh(X)}(\mathcal{I}(Y))
  \,.
$$

=--

This appears as [Johnstone, scholium C1.6.4](#Johnstone).


### Relation to topological spaces
 {#RelationToTopologicalSpaces}

Every [[topological space]] $X$ has a [[frame of opens]] $O(X)$, and therefore gives rise to a locale $X_L$.  For every [[continuous function]] $f\colon X \to Y$ between topologicals spaces, the [[preimage|inverse image]] map $f^{-1}\colon O(Y) \to O(X)$ is a frame homomorphism, so $f$ induces a continuous map $f_L\colon X_L \to Y_L$ of locales.  Thus we have a [[functor]] 

$(-)_L\colon$ [[Top]] $\to$ [[Loc|Locale]].

Conversely, if $X$ is any locale, we define a **[[point]]** of $X$ to be a [[continuous map]] $1 \to X$.  Here $1$ is the [[terminal object|terminal]] locale, which can be defined as the locale $1_L$ corresponding to the terminal space.  Explicitly, we have $O(1) = P(1)$, the [[powerset]] of $1$ (the initial frame, the set of [[truth value]]s, which is $2$ classically or in a [[Boolean topos]]).  Since a frame homomorphism $O(X) \to P(1)$ is determined by the preimage of $1$ (the [[true]] truth value), a point can also be described more explicitly as a _[[completely prime filter]]_: an upwards-closed subset $F$ of $O(X)$ such that $X \in F$ ($X$ denotes the [[top element]] of $O(X)$), if $U,V \in F$ then $U \cap V \in F$, and if $\bigcup_i U_i \in F$ then $U_i \in F$ for some $i$.

The elements of $O(X)$ induce a [[topological structure|topology]] on the set of points of $X$ in an obvious way, thereby giving rise to a topological space $X_P$.  Any continuous map $f\colon X \to Y$ of locales induces a continuous map $f_P\colon X_P \to Y_P$ of spaces, so we have another functor 

$(-)_P\colon Loc \to Top$.

One finds that $(-)_L$ is [[left adjoint]] to $(-)_P$.

In fact, this is an [[idempotent adjunction]]:

+-- {: .num_prop #TopLocAdjunction}
###### Proposition

The categories [[Top]] of [[topological spaces]] and [[Loc|Locale]] of locales are related by an [[idempotent adjunction]].

$$
  (
    (-)_L \dashv (-)_P
  )
  :
  Top
    \stackrel{\overset{(-)_L}{\rightarrow}}{\underset{(-)_P}{\leftarrow}}
  Locale
  \,.
$$

=--

This appears for instance as ([MacLaneMoerdijk, theorem IX.3 1](#MacLaneMoerdijk)) or as ([Johnston, lemma C.1.2.2](#Johnstone)).

Therefore the [[adjunction]] restricts to an [[equivalence of categories|equivalence]] between the fixed subcategories on either side.  

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A [[topological space]] $X$ with $X\cong X_{L P}$ is called **[[sober space|sober]]**.

A locale with $X\cong X_{P L}$ is called **[[spatial locale|spatial]]** or **topological**; one also says that it has **enough points**.

=--

+-- {: .num_cor}
###### Corollary

The [[adjunction]] from prop. \ref{TopLocAdjunction} exhibits sober topological spaces as a [[coreflective subcategory]] of [[Locale]]

$$
  (
    (-)_L \dashv (-)_P
  )
  :
  SoberTop
    \stackrel{\overset{(-)_L}{\hookrightarrow}}{\underset{(-)_P}{\leftarrow}}
  Locale
$$


and this restricts to an 
[[equivalence of categories]] between the [[full subcategory]] of locales with enough points, and that of [[sober topological space]]s.

=--

This appears for instance as ([MacLaneMoerdijk, corollary IX.3 4](#MacLaneMoerdijk)).


### Relation to toposes -- localic reflection
 {#RelationToToposes}

The [[frame]] of opens $O(X)$ corresponding to a locale $X$ is naturally a [[site]]:

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Given a locale $X$, with [[frame]] of open $O(X)$, say that a family of [[morphism]]s $\{U_i \to U\}$ in $O(X)$ is a [[cover]] if $U$ is the [[join]] of the $U_i$:

$$
  U = \vee_i U_i
  \,.
$$
=--

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

This defines a [[coverage]] on $O(X)$ and hence makes it a [[site]].
=--

For instance ([MacLaneMoerdijk, section 5](#MacLaneMoerdijk)).

+-- {: .un_def}
###### Definition

For $X$ a locale, write

$$
  Sh(X) := Sh(O(X))
$$

for the [[sheaf topos]] over the category $O(X)$ equipped with the above canonical structure of a [[site]].
=--

Write [[Topos]] for the category of [[Grothendieck topos]]es and [[geometric morphism]]s.

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

This construction defines a [[full and faithful functor]] $Sh(-) : $ [[Locale]] $\to$ [[Topos]].
=--

This appears for instance as [MacLaneMoerdijk, section IX.5 prop 2](#MacLaneMoerdijk).

+-- {: .un_def}
###### Definition

A topos in the image of $Sh(-) : Loc \to Topos$ is called a [[localic topos]].
=--

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

The functor $Sh(-) : Loc \to Topos$ has a [[left adjoint]] 

$$
  L : Topos \to Locale
$$

given by sending a [[topos]] $\mathcal{E}$ to the locale that is formally dual to the [[frame]] of [[subobject]]s of the [[terminal object]] of $\mathcal{E}$:

$$
  O(L(\mathcal{E})) := Sub_{\mathcal{E}}(*)
  \,.
$$
=--

This appears for instance as [MacLaneMoerdijk, section IX.5 prop 3](#MacLaneMoerdijk).

The functor $L$ here is also called **localic reflection**.

In summary this means that locales form a [[reflective subcategory]] of [[Topos]]

$$ 
  Locale \stackrel{\overset{L}{\leftarrow}}{\hookrightarrow}
  Topos
  \,.
$$

In fact this is even a genuine [[full sub-2-category]]: 

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

For all $X,Y \in $ [[Locale]] the [[2-functor]] $Sh :$ [[Locale]] $\to$ [[Topos]] induces an [[equivalence of categories]]

$$
  Sh : Locale(X,Y) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} Topos(Sh(X), Sh(Y))
  \,.
$$

=--

This appears as ([Johnstone, prop. C1.4.5](#Johnstone)).

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The [[poset of subobjects]] $Sub_{\mathca{E}}(*)$ of the terminal object of $\mathcal{E}$ is equivalent to the full [[subcategory]] $\tau_{\leq -1}(\mathcal{E})$ of $\mathcal{E}$ on the $(-1)$-[[truncated]] objects of $E$.

$$
  Sub_{\mathcal{E}}(*) \simeq \tau_{\leq -1} \mathcal{E}
  \,.
$$
=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

A $(-1)$-[[truncated]] sheaf $X$ is one whose values over any object are either the singleton set, or the [[empty set]]

$$
  X(X) \in \{*, \emptyset\} = \subset Set
  \,.
$$

A [[monomorphism]] of sheaves is a [[natural transformation]] that is degreewise a monomorphism of sets. Therefore the [[subobject]]s of the terminal sheaf (that assigns the singleton set to every object) are precisely the sheaves of this form.
=--

We may think of a [[frame]] as a [[(0,1)-topos]]. Then localic reflection is reflection of 1-toposes onto $(0,1)$-toposes and is given by $(-1)$-truncation: for $X$ a locale, $Sh(X)$ the corresponding [[localic topos]] and $\mathcal{E}$ any Grothendieck topos we have a natural equivalence

$$
  1Topos( \mathcal{E},  Sh X) \simeq (0,1)Topos(\tau_{\leq -1} \mathcal{E}, O(X))
$$

which is

$$
  \cdots \simeq Frame(O(X), Sub_{mathcal{E}}(*))
  \simeq
  Locale(L \mathcal{E} , X)
  \,.
$$

This is the beginning of a pattern in [[higher topos theory]], described at [[n-localic (∞,1)-topos]].
