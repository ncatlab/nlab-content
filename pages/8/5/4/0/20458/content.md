## Idea

What is called _experimental mathematics_ is the exploration of [[mathematics]] and the possibe [[truth]] of [[theorems]] not by general [[proof]], but by checking special cases using [[computer programs]].

## Examples

### Riemann hypothesis

A general [[proof]] of [[Riemann hypothesis]] remains famously open, but computer experiment so far confirms it, see [there](Riemann+hypothesis#ReferencesComputerChecks).

### Volume conjecture

A general [[proof]] of the [[volume conjectures]] remains open (though various special cases do have proof), but computer experiment (such as using [[SnapPy]]) so far confirms (and motivates) these conjectures.

### Image of beta

The [[image]] of the canonical [[homomorphism]] $\beta$ from the [[Burnside ring]] of a [[finite group]] to the [[representation ring]] over some [[field]] is partly known only by computer experiment, see [there](permutation+representation#WhenAllVirtualLinearRepsAreVirtualPermutationReps).
