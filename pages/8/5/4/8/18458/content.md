**Robinson's Joint Consistency Theorem:** If $T_1$ is a consistent $L_1$-theory, and $T_2$ is a consistent $L_2$-theory, then their union $T_1 \cup T_2$ is consistent when their intersection $T_1 \cap T_2$ is complete as an $(L_1 \cap L_2)$-theory.

**Proof:** Apply the [[Craig interpolation theorem]]. **QED.**

This may be used to demonstrate the [[Beth definability theorem]].
