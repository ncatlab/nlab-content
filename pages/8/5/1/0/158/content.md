An $\infty$-groupoid -- equivalently an [[(infinity,0)-category]] is an $\infty$-[[infinity-category|category]] in which all morphisms are [[equivalence|equivalences]].

#Models#

Familiar models for the catgeory [[Infinity-Grpd]] of _weak_ $\infty$-groupoids are 

* [[simplicial set]]s equipped with the standard [[model structure on simplicial sets]];

* [[Kan complex|Kan complexes]] 

* CW-complexes; see [[homotopy theory]].

#Strict $\infinity$-groupoids$#

Entirely strict $\infty$-groupoids, usually called $\omega$-groupoids or [[strict omega-groupoid|strict omega-groupoids]] are equivalent to [[crossed complex|crossed complexes]].
