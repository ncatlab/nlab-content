An $\infty$-groupoid is an $\infty$-[[infinity-category|category]] in which all morphisms are [[equivalence|equivalences]].

Two familiar models for _weak_ $\infty$-groupoids are [[Kan complex|Kan complexes]] and CW-complexes; see [[homotopy theory]].

Entirely strict $\infty$-groupoids, i.e. [[omega-category|omega-groupoids]] are equivalent to [[crossed complex|crossed complexes]].
