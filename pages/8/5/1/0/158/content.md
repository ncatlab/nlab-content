An $\infty$-groupoid is an $\infty$-[[higher category theory|category]] in which all morphisms have inverses of a suitable kind.

The most familiar model for _weak_ $\infty$-groupoids are [[Kan complex]]es.

Entirely strict $\infty$-groupoids, i.e. [[omega-category|omega-groupoids]] are equivalent to [[crossed complex]]es.
