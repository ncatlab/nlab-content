An $\infty$-groupoid is an $\infty$-[[higher category theory|category]] in which all morphisms have inverses of a suitable kind.

Two familiar models for _weak_ $\infty$-groupoids are [[Kan complex|Kan complexes]] and CW-complexes; see [[homotopy theory]].

Entirely strict $\infty$-groupoids, i.e. [[omega-category|omega-groupoids]] are equivalent to [[crossed complex|crossed complexes]].
