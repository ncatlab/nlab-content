An $\infty$-groupoid -- equivalently an [[(∞,0)-category]] is an [[∞-category]] in which all morphisms are [[equivalences]].

#Models#

Familiar models for the category [[∞-Grpd]] of _weak_ $\infty$-groupoids are 

* [[simplicial sets]] equipped with the standard [[model structure on simplicial sets]];

* [[Kan complex|Kan complexes]] 

* CW-complexes; see [[homotopy theory]].

#Strict $\infinity$-groupoids#

Entirely strict $\infty$-groupoids, usually called $\omega$-groupoids or [[strict ∞-groupoids]], are equivalent to [[crossed complexes]].
