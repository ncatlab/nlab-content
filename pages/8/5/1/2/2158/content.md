Given two [[sets]] $S$ and $T$ and an element $x$ of $T$, the __constant function__ from $S$ to $T$ with value $x$ is the [[function]] $f$ defined by
$$ f(a) = x $$
for every element $a$ of $S$.

More generally, any function $f: S \to T$ is a __constant function__ if
$$ f(a) = f(b) $$
for every element $a$ and element $b$ of $S$.  Note that every constant function with particular value (as defined earlier) is constant (as defined here).

The converse is a little more complicated.  If $S$ is [[inhabited set|inhabited]], then every constant function from $S$ to $T$ is the constant function from $S$ to $T$ with some particular value, which is unique.  If $S$ is [[empty set|empty]] but $T$ is inhabited, then the unique function from $S$ to $T$ is constant with any particular value in $T$.  If $S$ and $T$ are both empty, then the unique function from $S$ to $T$ is constant, but not constant at any particular value.

Using [[excluded middle]], we can say that, if $T$ is inhabited, then any constant function from $S$ to $T$ is constant at some (possibly not unique) value, but this theorem fails in [[constructive mathematics]].
