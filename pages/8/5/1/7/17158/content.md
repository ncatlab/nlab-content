## Idea

### Ancient idea

<div style="float:right;margin:0 10px 10px 0;"> <img src="http://www.crystalinks.com/harmonyspheresalchemy.jpg" width="150" />  </div>

In ancient times, _Musica Universalis_ or _Music of the Spheres_ referred to a philosophical concept that regards proportions of orbits in the [[solar system]] as exhibiting a cosmic harmony ([Plato 380BC](#Plato380bc)).

[[Johannes Kepler]] proposed that this is governed by the shape of the [[platonic solid|Platonic solids]] ([Kepler 1596](#Kepler1596)). (See also at _[[multiverse]]_.)

More recently, it was suggested that the term refers to the [[stable homotopy groups of spheres]] $\pi_\bullet(\mathbb{S})$ and the absolute [[E-∞ geometry]] over [[Spec(S)]] as seen by the [[MU]]-[[Adams spectral sequence]].


> My initial inclination was to call this book [[The Music of the Spheres]], but I was dissuaded from doing so by my diligent publisher, who is ever mindful of the sensibilities of librarians. ([Ravenel 86, p. xv](#Ravenel86))

> For the last 50 years one of the basic problems in algebraic topology has been the determination of the homotopy groups of spheres ([Mahowald-Ravenel 87, Sec. 1](#MahowaldRavenel87))

> As is well known, it is our manifest destiny as 21st century algebraic topologists to compute homotopy groups of spheres. ([Wilson 13, p. 1](#Wilson13))

> One of the most fundamental problems in topology is to determine the set of homotopy classes of continuous based maps between spheres. ([Isaksen-Wang-Xu 20, Sec. 1](#IsaksenWangXu20))

Modern [[chromatic homotopy theory]] makes contact between this kind of music and [[physics]]: 

1. the [[A-hat genus]] ([[partition function]] of the [[spinning particle]]) appears in the first chromatic level of the spheres;

1. the [[Witten genus]] ([[partition function]] of the [[spinning string]]) appears in the second chromatic level of the spheres.

Modern [[equivariant stable homotopy theory]] makes contact between this kind of music and Kepler's proposal: 

* the [[equivariant sphere spectrum|equivariance]]  of the [[quaternionic Hopf fibration]] under the [[symmetry groups]] of the [[platonic solid|Platonic solids]] ([[icosahedral group]], [[octahedral group]], [[tetrahedral group]]) makes further [[equivariant stable homotopy groups]] of spheres appear, see at _[quaternionic Hopf fibration -- class in equivariant stable homotopy theory](quaternionic%20Hopf%20fibration#ClassInEquivariantStableHomotopyTheory)_.

> For whatever it's worth, all these items come together in the _[[schreiber:Equivariant cohomology of M2/M5-branes]]_
