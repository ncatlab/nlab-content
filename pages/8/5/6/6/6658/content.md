## Idea

Given a [[fibered category]], a morphism along which the induced [[comparison functor]] between the [[category of descent data]] and the [[codomain fibration]] is [[fully faithful functor|fully faithful]] (resp. an [[equivalence of categories]]) is said to be a *descent morphism* (resp. *effective descent morphism*). 


## The case of codomain fibration 

### Definition
 {#Definition}

Let $C$ be a [[category]] with [[pullbacks]] and [[coequalizers]].  For any [[morphism]] $p\colon A\to B$, we have an [[internal category]] $ker(p)$ defined by $A\times_B A \rightrightarrows A$ (the [[kernel pair]] of $p$).  The [[category of descent data]] for $p$ is the category $C^{ker(p)}$ (the "[[descent object]]") of internal diagrams on this internal category.  Explicitly, an object of $C^{ker(p)}$ is a morphism $C\to A$ together with an action $A\times_B C \to C$ satisfying suitable axioms.

The evident internal functor $ker(p) \to B$ (viewing $B$ as a [[discrete category|discrete]] internal category) induces a *comparison functor* $C^B \to C^{ker(p)}$.  We say that $p$ is:

* a **descent morphism** if this [[comparison functor]] is [[fully faithful functor|fully faithful]], and
* an **effective descent morphism** if this comparison functor is an [[equivalence of categories]].

It is a little unfortunate that the more important notion of *effective descent* has the longer name, but it seems unwise to try to change it (although the [[Elephant]] uses "pre-descent" and "descent").

### Properties

Let $C$ be a category with pullbacks.

+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Theorem
$p\colon A\to B$ is a descent morphism if and only if $p$ is a [[pullback-stability|stable]] [[regular epimorphism]].

In particular, descent morphisms are closed under [[pullback]] and [[composition]].  Moreover, in a [[regular category]], the descent morphisms are precisely the regular epimorphisms.

Perhaps more surprising is:

###### Theorem
Effective descent morphisms are closed under pullback and composition.

See ([JT](#JT), 2.4), ([ST](#ST)) (in the case one has coequalisers) and ([RST](#RST)) (under just the assumption of finite limits) for proofs.

## General case

In general, [[descent]] is about higher [[sheaf]] conditions (i.e. [[stack]] conditions). More precisely, being an $n$-stack means that all
covers in the base are effective $n$-categorical descent morphism. Hence the morphism being of effective descent is a building block, the single morphism case of a stack condition. 

Thus, being an effective descent morphism says that the corresponding fibered category is a 1-stack ("2-sheaf") for the singleton covering family $p$.  Similarly, $p$ is a descent morphism iff the codomain fibration is a pre-stack (that is, a 2-separated 2-presheaf) for $p$.

More generally, we may use the terms "descent morphism" and "effective descent morphism" relativized to any [[fibration]] or [[indexed category]] rather than the codomain fibration.

We can also, of course, generalize to higher categories: an [[n-category]] with pullbacks has an analogue of a "codomain fibration", and we can ask for stack conditions on it.  This is most common in the case of [[(infinity,1)-categories]]; see the page [[descent]] for more information and links.

Descent can sometimes (for this we need to have also the direct image functor) be rephrased in terms of the [[monadicity theorem]]; see [[monadic descent]].

## Examples

If $C$ is [[exact category|exact]], or has stable [[reflexive coequalizers]], then every 
[[regular epimorphism]] is an effective descent morphism.  (See, for instance, section B1.5 of the [[Elephant]].)  In particular, this is the case for any [[topos]].

However, there are also important effective descent morphisms in non-exact categories.

* In [[Top]], there are characterizations of effective descent morphisms, see [CJ20](#EDM).

* In the category [[Loc]] of [[locales]], every [[triquotient map]] is an effective descent morphism.  These includes [[open map|open]] surjections and also [[proper map|proper]] surjections.

...

Of course, there are also many effective descent morphisms relative to fibrations other than the codomain fibration.  If $A$ is a [[stack]] for a particular [[Grothendieck topology]], then every singleton cover in that topology will be, by definition, an effective descent morphism relative to $A$.  A few important examples are:

* Every [[fpqc site|fpqc cover]] of [[schemes]] is an effective descent morphism relative to the indexed category $QCoh(-)$ of [[quasicoherent sheaves]].

...
