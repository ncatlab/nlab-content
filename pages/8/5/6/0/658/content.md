## Definition ##

Let $V$ be a symmetric [[closed monoidal category]] and $C$, $D$, [[enriched category|enriched categories]] over $V$. Then a **distributor** or **profunctor** or **[[bimodule|(bi)module]]** from $C$ to $D$ is a $V$-functor from $C \otimes D^{op}$ to $V$, we write

$$
  F : C &#8696; D : C\otimes D^{op} \to V
  \,.
$$

Such distributors are composed by using a [[end|coend]] to "trace out" the middle variable:

for $F : C &#8696; D$ and $G : D &#8696; E$ distributors, their composite  $G \circ F: C &#8696; E$ is defined to be

$$
  G \circ F := \int^{d \in D} F(-,d)\otimes G(d,-)
  \,.
$$

This yields a [[bicategory]] $V\Mod$ with

* objects are $V$-enriched categories;

* morphisms are distributors with the above composition;

* 2-morphisms are natural transformations.

At least for $V = Set$ a morphism in $Set Mod$ is often called a **profunctor** and the bicategory $Set Mod$ is then often denoted $Prof$.

### In terms of colimit-preserving functors on presheaf categories ###

A basic fact (e.g. Kashiwara, Schapira, [[Categories and Sheaves]], corollary 2.7.4, page 63) is that for $A$ a [[cocomplete category]], [[cocontinuous functor|colimit-preserving functors]] from [[presheaf|presheaves]] on some category $C$ to $A$ are canonically equivalent to functors from $C$ to $A$: we have an equivalence of [[functor category|functor categories]]

$$
 Cocont(PSh(C),A)
 \simeq
  Func(C,A)
  \,.
$$

This may be thought of as a consequence of the [[co-Yoneda lemma]] (and hence, of course, of the [[Yoneda lemma]]) which says that every presheaf is colimit over [[representable functor|representables]], i.e. over objects in the image of the [[Yoneda embedding]] $Y : C \to PSh(C)$. This immediate implies that a colimit-preserving functor on $PSh(C)$ is already determined by its restriction along $Y$ to $C$.

Now, distributors $C \otimes D^{op} \to V$ are [[adjunct]] to functors $C \to [D^{op}, V] \simeq PSh(D)$. Hence by the above, distributors are equivalent to colimit-preserving functors

$$
  PSh(C) \to PSh(D)
  \,.
$$

Indeed, there is an equivalence of bicategories
$V Mod$ and that of categories and colimit-preserving functors and natural transformation between their presheaf categories.

An explicit statement of this can be found for instance as prop. 4.2.4

This formulation plays a big role also in the context of [[(∞,1)-categories]]. A [[presentable (∞,1)-category]] is one equivalent to a [[localization]] of some [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-presheaves]] (i.e. some [[reflective (∞,1)-subcategory]] of the latter). The collection of all [[presentable (∞,1)-categories]] and colimit-preserving [[(∞,1)-functors]] betweem them forms the [[symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category of presentable (∞,1)-categories]], whose [[tensor product]] is the "bilinear" tensor product coming from interpreting colimit-preserving functors as "linear" (reading: colimit $\sim$ sum).

This $(\infty,1)$-category $Pr^L$ therefore is an $(\infty,1)$-analog of $Set\text{-}Mod$. In [[geometric ∞-function theory]] one finds (see section 4 there) that morphisms in $Pr^L$ encode the "correspondence operations" such as Fourier-Mukai and its generalizations. See in that context also the examples below.


## Examples ##

* Recall that a one-object [[Vect]]-[[enriched category]] is just an [[algebra]], while a general [[Vect]]-[[enriched category]] is an [[algebroid]]. The full sub-bicategory of $Vect\Mod$ on one-object $Vect$-enriched categories is the familiar category of [[algebras]], [[bimodules]] and bimodule homomorphisms.

* For $V = (Set, \times)$, $SetMod$ is the bicategory of [[locally small category|locally small categories]], [[profunctors]] and transformations. 

  The full sub-bicategory on [[discrete category|discrete categories]] is that of sets, [[spans]] of sets and morphisms of spans:
  $$
    Set\Mod_{disc} \simeq Span(Set) 
    \,.
  $$

* Accordingly for $S = (Set^{op}, \times)$ we get the bicategory of [[cospans]]
$$
  Set^{op}\Mod_{disc} \simeq Span(Set^{op}) = Cospan(Set) 
  \,.
$$


## Remarks ##

* Every ordinary $V$-functor $f : C \to D$ yields a distributor $\hat F : C &#8696; D$ which is 
the [[adjunct]] of the postcomposition 
$$
  C \stackrel{f}{\to} D \stackrel{Y}{\to} [D^{op},V]
$$
with the [[Yoneda embedding]] under the Hom-adjunction. This extends to a bifunctor
$$
  V\Cat \to V\Mod
  \,.
$$

  * For $V = Vect$ this is the generalization of how every morphism $A \to B$ of [[algebras]] induces the $A$-$B$ bimodule which as a vector space is $B$ with obvious right $B$ action and left $A$-action induced by first mapping $A$ to $B$ via $f$ and then using multiplication in $B$.

  * For $V = Set$ this is the fact that every map $f : C \to D$ of sets induces the span 
$$
  \array{
    && C
    \\
    & {}^{Id}\swarrow && \searrow^{f}
    \\
    C &&&& D
  }
$$

* The bifunctor $V\Cat \to V\Mod$ exhibits $V\Mod$ as a [[framed bicategory]], and makes $V\Cat$ into a [[2-category equipped with proarrows]].

## Notation ## {#notation}

Profunctors are often notated with a slashed or barred arrow, as in $C &#x21F8; D$.  It is not always obvious how to draw this character, so here are some hints.

* On the nLab (or anywhere on the web, really), it can be found using a Unicode entity: `&#x21F8;`

* In LaTeX, one can use `\nrightarrow` in a pinch, but a nice-looking extensible barred arrow command can also be produced with the following preamble code (modified from amsmath's `\xrightarrow`):

      \makeatletter
      \def\slashedarrowfill@#1#2#3#4#5{%
        $\m@th\thickmuskip0mu\medmuskip\thickmuskip\thinmuskip\thickmuskip
         \relax#5#1\mkern-7mu%
         \cleaders\hbox{$#5\mkern-2mu#2\mkern-2mu$}\hfill
         \mathclap{#3}\mathclap{#2}%
         \cleaders\hbox{$#5\mkern-2mu#2\mkern-2mu$}\hfill
         \mkern-7mu#4$%
      }
      \def\rightslashedarrowfill@{%
        \slashedarrowfill@\relbar\relbar\mapstochar\rightarrow}
      \newcommand\xslashedrightarrow[2][]{%
        \ext@arrow 0055{\rightslashedarrowfill@}{#1}{#2}}
      \makeatother

* In Xypic, a barred arrow can be produced with `\ar[r]|-@{|}`.


## Discussion ##

On a previous version of this entry with opposite convention on where to put the ${}^{op}$ [[Todd Trimble|Todd]] has remarked

+--{.query}
_Todd_: There is an inevitable debate here about whether one should use $C^{op} \otimes D \to V$ or $C \otimes D^{op} \to V$. My own convention is to use the latter. For example, every functor $C \to D$ yields a distributor by composition with the Yoneda embedding on $D$. 

[[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: My convention is $D^{op}\otimes C$.  I agree with your reasoning for why $D$ should be contravariant; I like to put it first because in the hom-functor $C(-,-)$ the contravariant variable appears first.
