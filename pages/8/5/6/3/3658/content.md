## Idea

this page is a draft, see:


* Wikipedia on the [Wightman axioms] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wightman_axioms)

The Wightman axioms are an attempt to develop a mathematically rigorous set of axioms for quantum field theory.  The axioms serve as the basis of what is known as _constructive_ field theory which seeks to show that quantum theory is _mathematically_ compatible with special relativity.  Arthur Wightman first formulated them in the 1950s but they were not published until 1964 after advances in scattering theory suggested confirmed their applicability.


## Wightman Axioms

Note: in some publications, the numbering of the axioms begins with 1 while in others it begins with 0.  We use the latter convention.

The states of a quantum theory are normalized vectors in a separable Hilbert space, $\mathcal{H}$.  Two such states that differ by a complex phase give rise to the same state.
