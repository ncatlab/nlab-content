A _cubical $T$-complex_ is a [[cubical set]] $K$ which is also a special kind of [[Kan complex]], in that it has a family $T_n \subseteq K_n$ (for $n \geq 1$) of _[[thin element]]s_ with the properties, (due first to Keith Dakin, for the [[simplicial T-complex|simplicial case]], in his  doctoral thesis):

* T1) Degenerate elements are thin. 

* T2) Every box in $K$ has a unique thin filler. 

* T2) If all but one face of a thin element are thin, then so also is the remaining face. 

Cubical T-complexes are equivalent to [[crossed complex]]es, and also to [[cubical omega-groupoid]]s with connections.

A modification of axiom T2) to be more like an axiom for a [[quasi-category]] is suggested in the paper by Steiner below.
