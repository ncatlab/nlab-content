## Idea

Let $P$ be a [[poset]] and $F:Rel\to Rel$ an endofunctor of [[Rel]].  A **$P_F$-valued set** is a set $A$ equipped with a function $F A\to P$.

The category of $P_F$-valued sets inherits a lot of structure from $P$: if $P$ is [[closed monoidal category|closed]] [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal]], [[star-autonomous]], etc., and $F$ is well-behaved, then so is the category of $P_F$-valued sets.  This provides a general method for constructing models of variants of [[linear logic]].

## Category of Poset-Valued Sets

A $P_F$-valued set $A$ consists of

1. An underlying set $A_0$.
2. A valuation $\alpha_A : F A_0 \to P$

A morphism $f : A \to B$ of $P_F$-valued sets consists of

1. An underlying *relation* $f_0 : A_0 &#8696; B_0$
2. Such that if $x F(f_0) y$ then $\alpha_A(x) \leq_{P} \alpha_B(y)$

This gives a category of $P_F$-valued sets using relational composition.
We can further get a [[double category]] of $P_F$-valued sets by noticing that the category structure above is the horizontal category of the [[comma double category]] of $F$ and $P$ viewed as a lax double functor from $1$ to the double category of sets and relations.

## Examples

If $P=\mathbf{3} = (0\le 1\le 2)$, with the star-autonomous structure where $1$ is both the unit object and the dualizing object, and $F(A) = A\times A$, then the category of $P_F$-valued sets includes the category of [[coherence spaces]] as a full subcategory, preserving the closed monoidal structure as well as products and coproducts.
