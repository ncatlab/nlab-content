## Idea ##

A [[mathematical structure]] used to define the [[real numbers]] in [[Alfred Tarski]]'s axioms for the [[real numbers]]. 

## Definition ##

A [[Tarski group]] is a [[pointed set|pointed]] [[commutative invertible semigroup]] $(G, +, -, 1)$ with a [[dense linear order]] $\lt$ such that $1 \lt 1 + 1$ and for all $a, b, c, d \in G$, $a + b \lt c + d$ implies that $a \lt c$ or $b \lt d$. 

As a result, every Tarski group is an [[abelian group]] with [[identity element]] $0 \coloneqq 1 - 1$, and a [[trivial group|nontrivial]] [[archimedean group]].

### In Tarski's axioms for the real numbers ###

* Axiom 4 says that $\mathbb{R}$ is a [[commutative semigroup]]. 

* Axiom 5 with axiom 4 together say that $\mathbb{R}$ is a [[commutative invertible semigroup]]. 

* Axiom 7 says that $\mathbb{R}$ is a [[pointed set]], which with axioms 4 and 5 imply that $\mathbb{R}$ is an [[abelian group]]

* Axiom 1 and part of axiom 3 together says that $\mathbb{R}$ is a [[linearly ordered set]]. 

* Axiom 2 says that the linear order is a [[dense linear order]].

* Axiom 6 says that for all $a, b, c, d \in G$, $a + b \lt c + d$ implies that $a \lt c$ or $b \lt d$, which with axioms 1, 4, 5, 7 imply that $\mathbb{R}$ is a linearly [[ordered group]] and an [[archimedean group]]

* Axiom 8 says that $1 \lt 1 + 1$, which indicates that $\mathbb{R}$ is not [[trivial group|trivial]].
