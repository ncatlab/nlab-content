## Idea

In the [[Lagrangian]] of a [[prequantum field theory]] the those terms that involve various [[field (physics)|fields]] describe the _coupling_ or _[[interaction]]_ of these fields with each other. Hence the prefactors of these terms encode the strength of this coupling, and hence are called _coupling constants_.

In [[perturbative quantum field theory]] the coupling constant (as well as [[Planck's constant]] which indicates the strength of [[quantum physics|quantum]] effects) is regarded as tiny, in fact as [[infinitesimal]], in that all [[observables]] are expressed as (generally non-converging, [[asymptotic series|asymptotic]]) [[formal power series]] in the coupling constant.
