Let $Aff$ be the category of commutative affine schemes (opposite to the category of commutative algebras). A family of maps $\{f_i : U_i\to X\}_{i\in I}$ in that category is a cover in __fpqc topology__ if the union of images cover $X$ as a topological space and all morphism $f_i$ are faithfully flat and quasicompact. The French for this is *fidelement plat et quasicompacte* (fpqc). Fpqc topology is one of the main [[Grothendieck topologies]] used in [[algebraic geometry]].
