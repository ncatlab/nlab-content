## Idea

In [[quantum field theory]] the term _gaugino_ denotes a field that is a [[superpartner]] of a [[gauge boson]]. This appears in [[super Yang-Mills theory]]. For instance the partner of a [[gluon]] in the [[MSSM]] is called a [[gluino]], and so on.

In terms of [[Chern-Weil theory]]/[[differential cohomology]] we have that
 
* [[gauge bosons]] are (the [[quanta]] of) [[connection on a bundle|connections]] on [[principal bundle]] or more generally the even components of [[superconnections]];

* gauginos are the odd components of superconnections.
