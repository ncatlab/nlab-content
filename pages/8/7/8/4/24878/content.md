## Idea

_Kleene's fixed point theorem_ theorem constructs least [[fixed points]] of [[endofunctions]] on [[posets]] by [[composition|iterating]] them. [[Adámek's fixed point theorem]] generalizes this to constructing [[initial algebras]].

## Construction

###### Theorem

Let $f : P \to P$ be a [[monotone function]] on a [[poset]] $P$. If $P$ has a [[least element]] $\bot$ and [[joins]] of increasing sequences, and if $f$ [[preserved colimit|preserves]] joins of increasing sequences, then a least [[fixed point]] of $f$ can be constructed as the join of the increasing sequence:

$$
  \bot 
  \;\leq\;
  f(\bot) 
  \;\leq\; 
  f^2(\bot) 
  \;\leq\; 
  \cdots
  \,.
$$
