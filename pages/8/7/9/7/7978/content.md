This page provides a hyperlinked index for the book

* [[Theodore Frankel]], 

  _The Geometry of Physics - An introduction_ 

  Cambridge University Press, 1997, 2004, 2012

  [website](http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~tfrankel/) (with errata and preface for 3rd edition)

on methods of [[differential geometry]] and their meaning and use in [[physics]], especially [[gravity]] and [[gauge theory]].

Among the nice aspects of the book are

* it discusses [[pseudoforms]] on top of ordinary [[differential forms]], instead of just assuming that all [[manifolds]]  are [[orientation|oriented]] as often done &#8212; and what\'s more, it explains the physical meaning of this!  (But it still uses [[Riemannian metric|metrics]] more than necessary.)
