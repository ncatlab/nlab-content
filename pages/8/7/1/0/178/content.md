#Idea#

A Lie $\infty$-groupoid is supposed to be an $\infty$-[[infinity-groupoid|groupoid]] [[internalization|internal to]] a suitable category of [[generalized smooth space|generalized smooth spaces]]. 

#Remarks#

The details usually depend on which aspect of higher [[Lie theory]] one wants to capture.

One wants Lie $\infty$-groupoids to be nicely related to [[Lie infinity-algebroid|Lie infinity-algebroids]].
