## Idea ##

A directed loop graph may be understood as a [[thin category|thin]] (0,1)-directed [[pseudograph]], hence as a thin directed pseudograph enriched over the [[cartesian monoidal category|cartesian monoidal]] [[poset]] of [[truth values]]. 
In generalization, one may speak of enriching directed loop graphs over other [[monoidal posets]].

## Defintion ##

Let $(M, \leq, \wedge, \top)$ be a [[monoidal poset]], such as a [[meet-semilattice]]. A **$M$-enriched directed loop graph** or **directed loop graph enriched over/in $M$** is a [[set]] $P$ with a [[binary function]] $o:P \times P \to M$ 

## Examples ##

* An ordinary directed loop graph is just an $\Omega$-enriched directed loop graph, with $\Omega$ the set of [[truth values]]. 

* A [[Lawvere metric space]] is a $\overline{\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}}$-enriched [[proset]], where $\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ are the [[non-negative number|non-negative]] [[Dedekind real numbers]]. 

* A [[quasipseudometric space]] is a $\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$-enriched [[proset]], where $\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ are the [[non-negative number|non-negative]] [[Dedekind real numbers]]. 

* A [[pseudometric space]] is a $\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$-enriched [[setoid]], where $\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ are the [[non-negative number|non-negative]] [[Dedekind real numbers]].
