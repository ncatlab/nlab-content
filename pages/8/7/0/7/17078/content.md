I'm a visiting assistant professor at UC Riverside. Before that, I was a graduate student at Brown University under [[Tom Goodwillie]]. [Here](https://kayaarro.site) is my webpage. My research interest is [[higher category theory]].

My undergraduate institution was Amherst College, where I studied with [[Michael Ching]]. I've decided to fill out this page so that when I make tweaks to $n$Lab articles, people know who is to blame.

If you'd like to contact me for any reason, I can be reached at kaya (dot) arro (at) ucr (dot) edu.
