I'm a visiting assistant professor at UC Riverside. Before that, I was a graduate student at Brown University under [[Tom Goodwillie]]. Before that, I was an undergraduate at Amherst College, where I studied under [[Michael Ching]]. [Here](https://kayaarro.site) is my webpage.

My research interest is [[higher category theory]], and more specifically functor calculi, and more specifically functor calculi in the mold of [[Michael Weiss]]' [[orthogonal calculus]].

If you'd like to contact me for any reason, I can be reached at kaya (dot) arro (at) ucr (dot) edu.
