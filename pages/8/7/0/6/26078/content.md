## Idea

Distribution in a sense of a linear functional on some functional space can be somewhat adapted to schemes. The problem is however to control the singular behaviour. A useful idea is to restrict singularities to a closed subscheme given by some ideal sheaf. The simplest case are distributions on a $k$-affine scheme $X$ over a field, supported at a point $p$. For a group scheme, one assumes that the point is the unit of the group and the algebra of distributions becomes a Hopf algebra. 

## Definition

Let $X$ be a $k$-affine scheme $X$ (where $k$ is a field).
For $n$ a nonnegative integer distributions on $X$ supported at $p$ of order $\leq n$ are linear functionals $k[X]\to k$ on the ring of regular functions $k[X]$ which vanish on $(n+1)$-st power of the ideal $I_p = \{ f\in k[X] | f(p) = 0\}$ of regular functions vanishing at $p$.

If $X = G$ is a $k$-affine group scheme by the Hopf algebra of distributions we mean the algebra of distributions supported at the unit of the group with its natural Hopf algebra structure. 

Largely equivalent notion, though usually differently defined is of a [[hyperalgebra of an affine algebraic group]].
