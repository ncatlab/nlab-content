## Idea

The [[integrability of G-structures]] exists to first order, precisely if a certain [[torsion]] [[obstruction]] vanishes. 


The _torsion of a $G$-structure_ is defined to be the space in which the invariant part of the [[torsion of a Cartan connection]] takes values, for any [[Cartan connection]] compatible with the $G$-structure (see at _[Cartan connection -- Examples -- G-Structure](Cartan%20connection#ExampleGStructures)_) ([Sternberg 64, from p. 317 on](#Sternberg64), [Lott 90, p.10](#Lott90), [Joyce 00, section 2.6](#Joyce00)).
