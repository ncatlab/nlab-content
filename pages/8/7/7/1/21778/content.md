## Idea

By _mesoscopic physics_ one mostly means that part of [[solid state physics]] which applies to material on the [[scale]] between [[nanometers]] and [[micrometers]].

This is about the scale where "macroscopic" bulk properties well-described by [[thermodynamics]] (see [[thermodynamic limit]]) begin to transition to "microscopic" behaviour (say of single [[molecules]]) well-described by [[quantum mechanics]].
