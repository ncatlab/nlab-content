There are two closely related constructions, due Yuri Manin, for finitely generated quadratic algebras, and due Tambara, for finite dimensional algebras.

## Tambara's universal coacting bialgebra

If $A$ is a finite dimensional (associative unital) $k$-algebra, and $D$ the functor $D\mapsto D\otimes A$ where $D$ is a $k$-algebras has a left adjoint $a(A,-)$. 
$$
Hom_{k-alg}(B,A\otimes D) \cong Hom_{k-alg}(a(A,B),D)
$$
where $A,D$ are arbitrary $k$-algebras.
$a(A,A)$ has a canonical structure of a coalgebra, making it into a $k$-bialgebra, the universal coacting bialgebra.

Tambara's construction is dual to the universal [[measuring coalgebra]] of Sweedler.

## Manin's universal coacting bialgebra

In a similar way to above, one utilizes the adjunction between inner hom and $!$ functor for quadratic algebras.
