## Idea ##

The different types of [[square root]] [[partial functions]] on the [[real numbers]] that satisfy the [[functional equation]] $f(x)^2 = x$ on some [[subset]] of the real numbers. 

## Definition ##

This following definition of a principal square root function comes from a joint proof of the existence of a principal square root function in the non-negative real numbers in constructive mathematics by Madeleine Birchfield [here](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/426103/proof-in-constructive-mathematics-that-the-principal-square-root-function-exists) and Fran√ßois G. Dorais  [here](https://mathoverflow.net/a/426110). Most of the following text has been copied from the two sources. 

Let us define the real numbers to be a Cauchy complete Archimedean ordered field, since that is the minimum requirement for which the inverse function theorem is true. 

There exists a square root function $\mathrm{sqrt}:(0, \infty) \to \mathbb{R}$ which is continuous on $(0,\infty)$, defined by 
$$\mathrm{sqrt}(x) \coloneqq e^{\frac{1}{2} \ln(x)}$$
We shall call this the **continuous principal square root**, to distinguish this function from the actual principal square root function that will be defined. 

Let us define continuous functions $f_n:[0, \infty) \to [0, \infty)$: 
$$f_n(x) = \begin{cases}
1/2^n & \mathrm{when}\; x \leq 1/4^n \\
\mathrm{sqrt}(x) & \mathrm{when}\; x \geq 1/4^n \\
\end{cases}$$
As stated, that requires knowing whether $x \leq 1/4^n$ or $x \geq 1/4^n$, but it is possible to work around this by patching three functions together:

 * $f^{-}_n:[0,1/4^n) \to [0, \infty)$ is the constant function with value $1/2^n$,
 * $f^{+}_n:(0,\infty) \to [0, \infty)$ is defined as $\max(1/2^n,\mathrm{sqrt}(x))$.

Since these functions agree on their overlap, and their domains comprise all of $[0, \infty)$ we do get a total function $f_n:[0, \infty) \to [0, \infty)$ as a result. 

Now the sequence of functions $(f_n)_{n=0}^\infty$ so defined converges uniformly on any bounded interval to a continuous function $\sqrt{(-)}:[0, \infty) \to [0, \infty)$ called the **principal square root** function. It is easily seen that $(\sqrt{x})^2 = x$ and $\sqrt{x^2} = x$. 

The principal square root function is used to define the [[Euclidean metric]] in [[Euclidean spaces]].  

## Other square root functions

According to ([Richman 2010](#Richman2010)), given the existence of a principal square root function, there are an uncountable number of functions that satisfy the [[functional equation]] $f(x)^2 = x$ on some [[subset]] of the [[real numbers]]. Each of these could be called a real "square root function". 

For example, let $1_{\mathbb{Q}}:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be the constructive Dirichlet indicator function, defined as $1_{\mathbb{Q}}(x) \coloneqq 1$ for every rational number $q \in \mathbb{Q}$, and $1_{\mathbb{Q}}(x) \coloneqq 0$ for every real number $x$ apart from every rational number $q \in \mathbb{Q}$ 

$$\forall q \in \mathbb{Q}. \vert x - q \vert \gt 0$$

Then the function $f(x) \coloneqq (-1)^{1_{\mathbb{Q}}(x)} \sqrt{x}$ is a real square root function, even though it is nowhere continuous, and not defined on the entire half-open interval $[0, \infty)$.
