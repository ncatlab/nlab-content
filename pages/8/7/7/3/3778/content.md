**Mikio Sato** is a Japanese algebraic geometer and number theorist. He founded a subject called algebraic analysis, which he introduced along with the sheaf theoretic technique of [[hyperfunction]]s, fundamental aspects of [[microlocalization]]. Sato studied [[D-module]]s and especially [[holonomic D-module|holonomic systems]]. 

Much of his research is related to the study of singularities and related research in Hodge theory where he substantially extended the foundations. The similarities of that research to [[B. A. Dubrovin]]'s noton of Frobenius manifolds  has been further developed by Klaus Hertling. He applied some of the methods to mathematical physics ([[integrable systems]], solitons and wave equations...).
