**Mikio Sato** is a Japanese algebraic geometer and number theorist. He founded a subject called algebraic analysis, which he introduced along with the sheaf theoretic technique of [[hyperfunction]]s and some basic techniques of microlocalization. He applied some of the methods to mathematical physics (inetgrable systems, wave equations...).
