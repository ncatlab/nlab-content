#Idea#

Recall that ordinary [[algebra]] concerns itself with [[monoid]]s [[internalization|internal to]] [[monoidal category|monoidal categories]]:

* a [[monoid]] [[internalization|internal to]] [[Set]] is just an ordinary [[monoid]];

* a [[monoid]] [[internalization|internal to]] [[Ab]], the category of abelian groups, is a [[ring]];

* a [[monoid]] [[internalization|internal to]] [[Vect]] is an ordinary algebra: a vector space equipped with a linear binary associative product with unit;

* a [[monoid]] in a [[category of chain complexes]] is a [[differential graded algebra]];

etc.


**Higher algebra** is similarly the study of monoids internal to [[infinity-category|higher categories]].

A central motivating example example for or special case of the study of higher algebra was

* monoids internal to the [[stable (infinity,1)-category of spectra]] -- called [[commutative ring spectrum|commutative ring spectra]]

The "higher algebra" embodied by [[commutative ring spectrum|commutative ring spectra]] has been called **brave new algebra** by F. Waldhausen.

More recently [[Jacob Lurie]] argued that the natural ambient formalism for "brave new algebra" is that of ([[symmetric monoidal (infinity,1)-category|symmetric]]) [[monoidal (infinity,1)-category|monoidal]] [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categories]]:

>We should emphasize that the theory of [[A-infinity algebra|A-infinity rings]] is not new. There are various definitions available in the the literature; see for example _EKMM97_. We have chosen to present the subject using the language of [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categories]], which we feel is the natural home for these ideas.
