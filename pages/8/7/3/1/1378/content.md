#Idea#

Recall that ordinary [[algebra]] concerns itself with [[monoid]]s [[internalization|internal to]] [[monoidal category|monoidal categories]]:

* a [[monoid]] [[internalization|internal to]] [[Set]] is just an ordinary [[monoid]];

* a [[monoid]] [[internalization|internal to]] [[Ab]], the category of abelian groupsm, is a [[ring]];

* a [[monoid]] [[internalization|internal to]] [[Vect]] is an ordinary algebra: a vector space equipped with a linear binary associative product with unit;

* a [[monoid]] in a [[category of chain complexes]] is a [[differential graded algebra]];

etc.


**Higher algebra** is similarly the study of monoids internal to [[infinity-category|higher categories]].

A central motivating example example for or special case of the study of higher algebra was

* monoids internal to the [[stable (infinity,1)-category of spectra]] -- called [[commutative ring spectrum|commutative ring spectra]]

The "higher algebra" embodied by them has been called **brave new algebra** by F. Waldhausen.
