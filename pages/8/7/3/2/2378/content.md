Let $X$ and $Y$ be [[topological spaces]]. The set $Map(X,Y)$ (often denotes also $C(X,Y)$) of [[continuous maps]] from $X$ to $Y$ has a natural topology called the __compact-open topology__: the basis of that topology is made by sets of the form $U_{K,V}$ where $K\subset X$ is [[compact space|compact]] and $V\subset Y$ is open and $U_{K,V}$ consists of all continuous maps $F:X\to Y$ such that $f(K)\subset V$. 

For the special case of the function spaces (that is when $Y$ is the real line or complex plane) where the domain is a [[metric space]], the compact-open topology is also known as the topology of uniform convergence on compacts, or if the domain $X$ is also compact, as the topology of uniform convergence. 

Compact-open topology is used in the formulation of the exponential law for topological spaces.
