## Idea

In mathematics, localization refers to the idea of formally adding inverses to some elements in an algebraic structure.

In particular, the structure itself can be a category, in which case localization adds formal inverses to morphisms.  This construction is known as a __[[category of fractions]]__ and also ambiguously as a __[[localization of a category]]__.  An important special case of this idea is the notion of a [[reflective localization]] / [[left Bousfield localization]], in which case the localization functor has a fully faithful right adjoint.  In some books (e.g., [[Higher Topos Theory]]) the term “localization” (when applied to categories or (∞,1)-categories) refers specifically to [[reflective localizations]].
