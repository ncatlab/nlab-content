## Idea

... [[derived algebraic geometry]] ... [[higher algebra]] ...[[generalized scheme]]...



## Definition

Let $k$ be a commutative [[ring]].

A **derived scheme** (over $k$) is a [[generalized scheme]] in the sense of locally affine $\mathcal{G}$-[[structured (infinity,1)-topos]] for $\mathcal{G} = \mathcal{G}_{Zar}(k)$ the Zariski [[geometry (for structured (infinity,1)-toposes)]].

## Special cases 

A [[n-truncated structured (infinity,1)-topos|0-trucated]] and [[n-localic (infinity,1)-topos|0-localic]] derived scheme is precisely an ordinary [[scheme]].

More precisely:

###### Proposition ([[Structured Spaces|StSp]], 4.2.9)

Let $Sch_{\leq 0}^{\leq 0}(\mathcal{G}_{Zar}(k)) \subset Sch(\mathcal{G}_{Zar}(k))$ be the full subcategory of all derived schemes on the [[n-truncated structured (infinity,1)-topos|0-trucated]] and [[n-localic (infinity,1)-topos|0-localic]] ones. This is canonically equivalent to the ordinary category $Sch(k)$ of [[scheme]]s over $k$:

$$
  Sch_{\leq 0}^{\leq 0}(\mathcal{G}_{Zar}(k))
  \simeq
  Sch(k)
  \,.

## Related concepts 

Notice that for [[generalized scheme]]s the Zariski [[geometry (for structured (infinity,1)-toposes)]] $\mathcal{G}_{Zar}(k)$ is not interchangeable with the [[étale (∞,1)-site]] $\mathcal{G}_{et}(k)$. Instead $\mathcal{G}_{et}(k)$-[[generalized scheme]]s are [[derived Deligne-Mumford stack]]s.
