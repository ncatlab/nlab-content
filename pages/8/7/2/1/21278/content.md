[[!redirects homotopy products]]
## Idea

__Homotopy products__ are a special case of [[homotopy limits]],
when the indexing diagram is a [[discrete category]].

## Computation

In any [[model category]], the homotopy product
of a family of objects $\{A_i\}_{i\in I}$
can be computed by fibrantly replacing each $A_i$
and computing the (ordinary) [[product]]
of the resulting family $\{RA_i\}_{i\in I}$ of [[fibrant replacements]].

## Examples

In [[simplicial sets]] with [[simplicial weak equivalences]], finite homotopy products can be computed by taking their (ordinary) [[product]], because finite products preserve weak equivalences. More generally, homotopy products can be computed by applying Kan's [[Ex^∞]] functor to each [[simplicial set]] and taking their (ordinary) [[product]]. 

In [[topological spaces]] with [[weak homotopy equivalences]],
homotopy products can be computed as ordinary [[products]].
The same applies to the [[relative category]]
of [[chain complexes]] and [[quasi-isomorphisms]].
