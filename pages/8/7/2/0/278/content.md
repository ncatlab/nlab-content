## Scope

__Differential geometry__ is a mathematical discipline studying geometry of spaces using differential and integral calculus. Classical differential geometry studied submanifolds (curves, surfaces...) in Euclidean spaces. The traditional objects of differential geometry are finite and infinite-dimensional [[differentiable manifold]]s modelled locally on [[topological vector space]]s. Techniques of differential calculus can be further stretched to [[generalized smooth space]]s. One often distinguished analysis on manifolds from differential geometry: analysis on manifolds focuses on functions from a manifold to the ground field and their properties, togehter with applications like PDEs on manifolds. Differential geometry on the other hand studies objects embedded into the manifold like submanifolds, their relations and additional structures on manifolds like bundles, connections etc. while the topological aspects are studied in a younger branch (from 1950s on) which is called [[differential topology]].

## Generalized smooth spaces from $n$POV

See also [[generalized smooth space]].

Finite-dimensional _differential geometry is the [[geometry]] modeled on [[Cartesian space]]s and [[smooth functions]] between them.

Formally, it is the [[higher geometry|geometry]] modeled on 
the [[pregeometry (for structured (infinity,1)-toposes)|pre-geometry]] $\mathcal{G} = $[[CartSp]].

This includes a sequence of concepts of [[generalized smooth space]]s:

* A [[smooth manifold]] (see there for details) is a locally $CartSp$-representable object in the [[sheaf topos]] $Sh(CartSp)$.

* A [[diffeological space]] (see there) is a [[concrete sheaf]] in the [[cohesive topos]] $Sh(CartSp)$.

* a [[Lie groupoid]] is a locally representable object in the [[(2,1)-sheaf]] [[(2,1)-topos]] $Sh_{(2,1)}(CartSp)$;

* an [[∞-Lie groupoid]] is an object in the [[(∞,1)-sheaf (∞,1)-topos]] $Sh_{(\infty,1)}(CartSp)$.

Similarly, standard models of [[synthetic differential geometry]] in [[higher geometry]] are modeled on the [[pregeometry (for structured (infinity,1)-toposes)|pre-geometry]] $\mathcal{G} = $[[ThCartSp]]. To wit, the [[cohesive topos]] $Sh(ThCartSp)$ is the [[smooth topos]] called the [[Cahiers topos]]:

* an [[infinitesimal space]] is a certain object in $ThCartSp$;

* an [[∞-Lie algebroid]] is a certain object in the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves]] $Sh_{(\infty,1)}(ThCartSp)$.
