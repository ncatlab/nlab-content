## Idea

_Differential geometry_ is the [[higher geometry|geometry]] modeled on 
the [[pregeometry (for structured (infinity,1)-toposes)|pre-geometry]] $\mathcal{G} = $[[CartSp]].

* A [[smooth manifold]] (see there for details) is a locally $CartSp$-representable object in the [[sheaf topos]] $Sh(CartSp)$.

* A [[diffeological space]] (see there) is a [[concrete sheaf]] in the [[cohesive topos]] $Sh(CartSp)$.

* a [[Lie groupoid]] is a locally representable object in the [[(2,1)-sheaf]] [[(2,1)-topos]] $Sh_{(2,1)}(CartSp)$;

* an [[∞-Lie groupoid]] is an object in the [[(∞,1)-sheaf (∞,1)-topos]] $Sh_{(\infty,1)}(CartSp)$.

Similarly, standard models of [[synthetic differential geometry]] in [[higher geometry]] are modeled on the [[pregeometry (for structured (infinity,1)-toposes)|pre-geometry]] $\mathcal{G} = $[[ThCartSp]]. To wit, the [[cohesive topos]] $Sh(ThCartSp)$ is the [[smooth topos]] called the [[Cahiers topos]]:

* an [[infinitesimal space]] is a certain object in $ThCartSp$;

* an [[∞-Lie algebroid]] is a certain object in the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves]] $Sh_{(\infty,1)}(ThCartSp)$.
