## Idea 

The concept of _degree_ of a [[coherent sheaf]] is a generalization of the concept of [[first Chern class]] of a [[line bundle]] (to which it reduces for coherent sheaves of [[sections]] of [[holomorphic line bundles]] over [[Riemann surfaces]] in [[complex analytic geometry]], see at _[first Chern class -- In complex analytic geometry](first+Chern+class#InComplexAnalyticGeometry)_).

## Definition

Discussion of degrees of coherent sheaves over [[complex curves]] is  in
e.g. ([Huybrechts-Lehn 96, def. 1.2.11](#HuybrechtsLehn96)).

On a [[compact topological space|compact]] [[Kähler manifold]] $(X,\omega)$ of complex [[dimension]] $n$, then the degree of a [[torsion subgroup|torsion]]-free [[holomorphic vector bundle]] $E$ is the [[integral of differential forms]]

$$
  deg(E)
  =
  \int_X c_1(E) \wedge \omega^{\wedge_{n-1}}
$$

of the [[de Rham cohomology|de Rham representative]] of the actual [[first Chern class]] of $E$ wedge with copies of the given [[symplectic form]] (e.g. [Scheinost-Schottenloher 96, def. 1.14](#ScheinostSchottenloher96)).
