## Idea

One says that for instance a [[functor]] on [[spaces]] (e.g. some [[cohomology]]) is "homotopy invariant" if  it does not distinguish between a space $X$ and the space $X \times I$, where $I$ is an [[interval]].

The term _homotopy invarianr_ may also refer to the refinement of [[invariants]] to [[homotopy theory]], hence to [[homotopy fixed points]].
