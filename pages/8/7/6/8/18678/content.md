## Idea

In [[BV-BRST formalism]] a _gauge fixing fermion_ is an element $\psi$ in a [[resolution|resolved]] [[BV-BRST complex]] whose anti-Hamiltonian flow is used to [[isomorphism|isomorph]] the complex into one that admits a degreewise [[covariant phase space]]. This is part of the process of "[[gauge fixing]]" in [[BV-BRST formalism]].

This is called a "fermion" only because it has to sit in BV-BRST degree (-1). Besides this odd grading, it has nothing to do with the concept of [[fermions]]. Of course, if the [[field theory]] in question does contain [[fermion fields]], then the "gauge fixing fermion" may depend on these.

For details see at _[[A first idea of quantum field theory]]_ the section _[gauge fixing](geometry+of+physics+--+A+first+idea+of+quantum+field+theory#GaugeFixing)_.
