## Idea

In [[BV-BRST formalism]] a _gauge fixing Lagrangian density_ (traditionally called a "gauge fixing fermion") is a [[Lagrangian density]] $\mathbf{L}_{gf}$ whose [[Lagrangian function]] $L_{gf}$ is in degree -1 in a [[resolution|resolved]] [[BV-BRST complex]] whose [[Hamiltonian flow]] under the [[local antibracket]] is used to [[isomorphism|isomorph]] the complex into one that admits a degreewise [[covariant phase space]]. This is part of the process of "[[gauge fixing]]" in [[BV-BRST formalism]].

This is called a "fermion" only because it has to sit in BV-BRST degree (-1). Besides this odd grading, it has nothing to do with the concept of [[fermions]]. Of course, if the [[field theory]] in question does contain [[fermion fields]], then the "gauge fixing fermion" may depend on these.

## Details
