## Idea

_Khovanov homology_ is a [[knot invariant]] that is a [[categorification]] of the [[Jones polynomial]]. 

## Interpretation in QFT

Khovanov homology has long been expected to appear as the [[observable]]s in a 4-dimensional [[TQFT]] in higher analogy of how the [[Jones polynomial]] arises as a observables in 3-dimensional [[Chern-Simons theory]]. For instance for $\Sigma : K \to K'$ a [[cobordism]] between two [[knot]]s there is a natural morphism

$$
  \Phi_\Sigma . \mathcal{K}(K) \to \mathcal{K}(K')
$$

between the Khovanov homologies associated to the two knots.


In ([Witten11](#Witten11)) it is argued, following indications in ([GukovSchwarzVafa05](GukovSchwarzVafa04)) that this 4d TQFT is related to the worldvolume theory of D3-[[brane]]s ending on NS5-[[brane]]s as they appear in the [[string theory|type IIA string theory]] [[spacetime]]. Earlier indication for this had come from the observation [Witten92](#Witten92) that Chern-Simons theory is the effective background theory for the [[A-model]] 2d [[TCFT]] (see <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/TCFT#ActionFunctionals">TCFT -- Worldsheet and effective background theories</a> for details).
