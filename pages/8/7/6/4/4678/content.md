A **[[localization functor]]** $Q^* : A\to B$ is **affine** if it has a right adjoint $Q_*$ (which is automatically fully faithful, i.e. the localized category if reflective), and which itself is having its own right adjoint $Q^!$. Therefore $Q^*\dashv Q_* \dashv Q^!$.

For example, every left [[Ore localization]] of [[ring]]s $i: R\to S^{-1}R$, induces a [[flat functor|flat]] affine localization functor $M\mapsto S^{-1}M = S^{-1}R\otimes_R M$.

A functor is affine localization if it is an inverse image part of an  "affine morphism" with *full* direct image functor. Here affine morphism (of categories) means an adjoint triple like above with *faithful* direct image functor. While the notion of affine localization is fixed, the notion of an affine morphism given here has variants depending on the categorical context.
