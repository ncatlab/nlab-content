## Idea

Given a [[symmetric operator]] on a domain of some [[Hilbert space]], there may be several _extensions_ of it to a [[self-adjoint operator]]. These typically correspond to choices of _boundary conditions_ ([WeiJiang](#WeiJiang)).

## Applications

### In quantum mechanics

In [[quantum mechanics]] the [[observable]]s are supposed to be [[self-adjoint operator]]s, in particular the [[Hamiltonian]]. The physical input often directly provides only a [[symmetric operator]], which encodes _local_ information about the [[dynamics]] of the system . The choice of its self-adjoint extension corresponds to choices of _boundary conditions_ on the [[state]]s of the system, hence _global_ information about the _[[kinematics]]_ . 

See the [References on applications in quantum mechanics](#ReferencesApplicationsQM) below.
