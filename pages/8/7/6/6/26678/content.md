## Definition

A P-space is a [[topological space]] in which every $G_\delta$ subset is open or equivalently every $F_\sigma$ subset is closed.

## Properties

\begin{lem}
[[Alexandroff spaces]] are P-spaces.
\end{lem}
This follows since even arbitary intersections of open sets are per definition open in [[Alexandroff spaces]].
\begin{lem}
P-spaces are [[countably orthocompact]].
\end{lem}
This follows since every countable open covering of a P-space is inner-preserving (meaning that for every point the intersection of all open sets of the open covering containing it is open).
