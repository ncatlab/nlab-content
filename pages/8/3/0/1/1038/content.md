* Jacob Lurie, _Stable $\infty$-Categories_ ([pdf](http://www-math.mit.edu/~lurie/topoibook/DAGI.pdf))

For a definition of stable $\infty$-categories see [[stable infinity-category]].

#Summary#

Based on the theory of [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categories]] as developed in his book [[Higher Topos Theory]], Lurie studies here $(\infty,1)$-categories of "stable objects", i.e. of objects that behave like [[spectrum|spectra]] in that for each object $X$ there not only its [[loop space object]] $\Omega X$ but also conversely, $X$ is the [[loop space object]] of another object $\Sigma X$. 

The definition is very simple.
The homotopy category of a stable $(\infty,1)$-category is shown to be a [[triangulated category]]: the comparatively complicated axioms of triangulated categories follow from the simple $(\infty,1)$-categorical axioms. Large chunks of homological algebra is then re-examined from the more natural point of view of stable $(\infty,1)$-categories.
