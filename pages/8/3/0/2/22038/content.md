## Idea

In [[Lattice QCD]], the extraction of hadronic observables involves scale setting for a particular lattice action with given sea-quark configurations. This involves the extrapolation of the dimensionless product of various quantities, such as gradient-flow scales and the omega [[baryon]] mass, to the continuum and infinite volume limit. This is in turn, interpolated to quark mass points in the isospin limit. These extrapolation functions must incorporate:

1. Light and Strange Quark Mass Dependence
2. Finite Volume Corrections
3. Discretization Corrections
The [[Symanzik Effective Theory]] is constructed by expanding the discretized action about the continuum limit.
