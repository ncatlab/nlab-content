
Traditionally:

* **in [[group theory]]**

  1. the term *[[amalgamated free product of groups]]* refers to what really are *[[pushouts]]* in the [[category]] [[Grp]], while

  1. the plain term "[[free product]]" really refers to [[coproducts]] in the [[category]] [[Grpd]];

therefore it makes sense to generally agree that:

* **in [[category theory]]** the term "*amalgamated coproduct*" or just "*amalgamation*" refers to [[pushouts]] (seen, if you will, as [[coproducts]] in a [[coslice category]]).

Beware though, while the terminology "amalgamation" indeed neatly captures the nature of [[pushouts]] in general [[categories]], traditionally it is not widely used in this generality.

Moreover, but only vaguely related:

* **in [[model theory]]** there is a notion of *[[amalgamation property]]* of [[structures in model theory]].

Finally, the term *[[amalgamation theory]]* is used here and there...
