## Idea

An **$(\infty,1)$-product**  is a [[limit in an (∞,1)-category]] $\mathcal{C}$ over a [[diagram]] of the shape

$$
  \{A \quad B\} \to \mathcal{C}
  \,.
$$

In other words it is a [[cone]] $A \to A \sqcup B \leftarrow B$ which is [[universal property|universal]] among all such cones in the $(\infty,1)$-categorical sense.

This is the analog in [[(∞,1)-category theory]] of the notion of [[product]] in [[category theory]].
