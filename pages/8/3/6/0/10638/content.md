## Idea

A degenerate [[elliptic curve]] with [[nodal singularity]]. Appears in the construction of the [[compactification]] of the [[moduli stack of elliptic curves]].

Over a given base ring $R$ it is an elliptic curve over the [[power series]] $R [ [ q ] ]$ which may be thought of as the quotient of the [[multiplicative group]] by $q^{\mathbb{Z}}$.

## Properties

### Relation to complex K-theory
 {#RelationToComplexKTheory}

The Tate curve is naturally an [[oriented elliptic curve]] and as such classified by a map


$$
  Spec \left(  KU ( ( q ) ) \right) \longrightarrow \mathcal{M}^{Der}
$$

in [[derived algebraic geometry]], from the spectrum of the [[power series]] over the [[KU]] [[E-âˆž ring]] to the [[derived moduli stack of derived elliptic curves]].

### Relation to the Witten genus

The [[elliptic genus]] associated with the Tate curve is, according to the [above](#RelationToComplexKTheory) a [[formal power series]] of [[K-theory]] classes. This is the _[[Witten genus]]_ ([Hopkins 94](#Hopkins94)).

Physically, Witten obtained this as the [[partition function]] of the [[heterotic string]] in [[perturbation theory]] about configurations where all the [[worldsheet]] sits in a single point of [[target space]]. This limiting case of the [[worldsheet]] is the Tate curve.
