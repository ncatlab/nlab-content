## Idea

The notion of _coproduct_ is a generalization to arbitrary [[categories]] of the notion of [[disjoint union]] in the category [[Set]].


## Definition

For $C$ a [[category]] and $x, y \in Obj(C)$ two [[object]]s, their **coproduct** is an object $x \coprod y$ in $C$ equipped with two [[morphism]]s

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
x \arrow[rd, "i_x"'] &            & y \arrow[ld, "i_y"] \\
                     & x \amalg y &                    
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

such that this is [[universal property|universal]] with this property, meaning such that for any other object with maps like this

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
x \arrow[rd, "f"'] &   & y \arrow[ld, "g"] \\
                   & Q &                  
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

there exists a _unique_ morphism $(f,g) :  x \coprod y \to Q$ such that we have the following [[commuting diagram]]:

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
x \arrow[rd, "f"'] \arrow[r, "i_x"] & x \amalg y \arrow[d, "{(f, g)}"] & y \arrow[ld, "g"] \arrow[l, "i_y"'] \\
                                    & Q                                &                                    
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

This morphism $(f,g)$ is called the __[[copairing]]__  of $f$ and $g$.  The morphisms $x\to x\coprod y$ and $y\to x\coprod y$ are called [[coprojections]] or sometimes "injections" or "inclusions", although in general they may not be [[monomorphisms]].


**Notation.** The coproduct is also denoted $a+b$ or $a\amalg b$, especially when it is [[disjoint coproduct|disjoint]] (or $a \sqcup b$ if your fonts don\'t include '$\amalg$'). The copairing is also denoted $[f,g]$ or (when possible) given vertically: $\left\{{f \atop g}\right\}$.


A coproduct is thus the [[colimit]] over the [[diagram]] that consists of just two objects. 

More generally, for $S$ any [[set]] and $F : S \to C$ a collection of objects in $C$ indexed by  $S$, their **coproduct** is an object

$$
  \coprod_{s \in S} F(s)
$$

equipped with maps

$$
  F(s)  \to \coprod_{s \in S} F(s)
$$

such that this is [[universal property|universal]] among all objects with maps from the $F(s)$. 

## Examples

*  In [[Set]], the coproduct of a [[family of sets]] $(C_i)_{i\in I}$ is the [[disjoint union]] $\coprod_{i\in I} C_i$ of sets.

   This makes the coproduct a [[categorification]] of the operation of addition of [[natural number]]s and more generally of [[cardinal]] numbers: for $S,T \in FinSet$ two finite sets and $|-| : FinSet \to \mathbb{N}$ the [[cardinality]] operation, we have

   $$
     |S \coprod T| = |S| + |T|
     \,.
   $$

*  In [[Top]], the coproduct of a family of spaces $(C_i)_{i\in I}$ is the space whose set of points is $\coprod_{i\in I} C_i$ and whose open subspaces are of the form $\coprod_{i\in I} U_i$ (the internal [[disjoint union]]) where each $U_i$ is an [[open subspace]] of $C_i$.  This is typical of [[topological concrete categories]].

*  In [[Grp]], the coproduct is the "[[free product of groups]]", whose [[underlying set]] is *not* a [[disjoint union]].  This is typical of [[algebraic category|algebraic categories]].

*  In [[Ab]], in [[Vect]], the coproduct is  the [[subobject]] of the [[product]] consisting of those tuples of elements for which only finitely many are not 0.

*  In [[Cat]], the coproduct of a family of categories $(C_i)_{i\in I}$ is the category with
   $$Obj(\coprod_{i\in I} C_i) = \coprod_{i\in I} Obj(C_i)$$
   and
   $$
     Hom_{\coprod_{i\in I} C_i}(x,y) = 
     \left\{
       \begin{aligned}
         Hom_{C_i}(x,y) & if x,y \in C_i
         \\
         \emptyset & otherwise
       \end{aligned}
     \right.
   $$ 

*  In [[Grpd]], the coproduct follows [[Cat]] rather than [[Grp]].  This is typical of [[oidifications]]: the coproduct becomes a disjoint union again.


## Properties

* A coproduct in $C$ is the same as a [[product]] in the [[opposite category]] $C^{op}$.

* When they exist, coproducts are unique up to unique canonical isomorphism, so we often say "[[generalized the|the]] coproduct."

* A coproduct indexed by the [[empty set]] is an [[initial object]] in $C$.
