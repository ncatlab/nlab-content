A **coproduct** of two [[object|objects]] $a,b$ in a [[category]] $C$ is an object $a+b$ (also written $a\sqcup b$, especially when it is [[disjoint coproduct|disjoint]]) equipped with [[morphism|morphisms]] $i:a\to a+b$ and $j:b\to a+b$ such that for any object $c$ with morphisms $f:a\to c$ and $g:b\to c$, there is a unique morphism $p:a+b\to c$ such that $p i=f$ and $p j=g$.

A coproduct in $C$ is the same as a [[product]] in its [[opposite category]] $C^{op}$.
