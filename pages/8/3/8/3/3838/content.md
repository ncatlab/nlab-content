## Idea

The notion of _essentially small $(\infty,1)$-category_ is the generalization of the notion of [[small category]] from [[category theory]] to [[(∞,1)-category]] theory.

## Definitions

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition
  
A [[quasi-category]] $C$ is **essentially $\kappa$-small** for some [[regular cardinal]] $\kappa$ if 

1. the collection of [[equivalence in a quasi-category|equivalence classes]] in $C$ is $\kappa$-small;

1. for every morphism $f : x \to y$ in $C$ the [[simplicial homotopy group|homotopy sets]] of the [[hom-object in a quasi-category|hom ∞-groupoid]] at $f$ --  $\pi_i(Hom^R(x,y),f)$ -- are $\kappa$-small.

$C$ is **essentially small** if it is essentially $\kappa$-small for some small [[regular cardinal]] $\kappa$.
