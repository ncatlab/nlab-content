## Idea

According to the [[duality between geometry and algebra]],
various ([[opposite category|opposite]]) [[categories]] of [[commutative algebras]] and similar objects
are [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to certain corresponding categories of [[spaces]].

For example, [[Gelfand duality]] establishes
a [[opposite category|contravariant]] [[equivalence of categories]]
between the category of [[commutative algebra|commutative]] [[associative unital algebra|unital]] [[C*-algebras]]
and the category of [[compact Hausdorff topological spaces]].

Thus, one can drop the commutativity condition and argue
that studying arbitrary [[C*-algebras]] amounts
to studying [[noncommutative topology|noncommutative general topology]],
a part of [[noncommutative geometry]].

Analogously, in [[measure theory]] one works with [[commutative von Neumann algebras]] instead, which are equivalent to several other categories:
[[localizable measurable space|compact strictly localizable]] [[enhanced measurable spaces]],
[[hyperstonean topological spaces]] and [[open maps]],
[[hyperstonean locales]] and [[open maps]],
[[measurable locales]] (and arbitrary morphisms of [[locales]]).

Thus, dropping the commutativity condition
results in the [[category of von Neumann algebras]]
(with ultraweakly continuous $*$-homomorphisms),
and we can view this [[category]]
as the [[category]] of __noncommutative measurable spaces__.

Thus, noncommutative measure theory is more-or-less the study
of [[von Neumann algebras]], more precisely those aspects of them
that reproduce known phenomena in [[measure theory]] when specialized
to the commutative case.


## Examples

The notion of a [[spatial product]] of (compact strictly localizable enhanced) [[measurable spaces]]
can be expressed algebraically as the [[spatial tensor product]]
of [[von Neumann algebras]].
This is quite different from the categorical [[product]]
of measurable spaces, which corresponds to the Dauns [[tensor product]]
of [[von Neumann algebras]].

As another example, the theory of $L^p$-[[Lebesgue space|spaces]] generalizes
to [[von Neumann algebras]].
This is a work of many authors, including [[von Neumann]],
[[Edward Nelson]], [[Irving Segal]], and [[Uffe Haagerup]].
It plays a crucial role in [[Tomita-Takesaki modular theory]],
which is essentially nothing else than the theory of $L^p$-spaces
where $p$ is a purely [[imaginary number]].
In particular, it allows one to classify [[type III factors]].

The notion of a [[measure]] is replaced by that of a normal [[weight]] on a [[von Neumann algebra]].
A [[trace]] on a [[von Neumann algebra]] is a special type of a [[weight]].

The notion of a [[measurable field of Hilbert spaces]]
can be expressed using two equivalent categories:
the category of [[W*-modules]] over [[von Neumann algebras]],
and the category of [[representations of von Neumann algebras]]
on a [[Hilbert space]].
