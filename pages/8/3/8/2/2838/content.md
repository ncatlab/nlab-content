## Idea ##

>The notion of [[Grothendieck topos]] is often presented as a generalisation of that of [[topological space]], one in which the points of the space may have non-trivial [[automorphisms]]. However, the analogy is not precise, since in a topological space, it is the points which have conceptual priority over the open sets, whereas in a topos it is the other way around. Hence a topos is more correctly regarded as a generalised [[locale]], than as a generalised space. ---[[Richard Garner]]

Garner developed the notion of _ionad_ to stand 'in the same relationship to a topological space as a (Grothendieck) topos does to a locale'. An ionad has a _category_ of \'open sets\' instead of a poset of opens like a topological space, much as a topos generalises a locale by allowing non-trival endomorphisms of objects. 

The category $Set^X$ plays an role in the theory of ionads analogous to that of the poset $\{0\lt 1\}^X$.

[[David Roberts]]: The idea strikes me that we are passing from the [[subobject classifier]] $2 = \{0 \lt 1\}$ in $Set$ (assuming classical Booleaness) to the categorified subobject classifier $Set$ in $Cat$.

Some basic aspects of the theory are developed there, and applications to [[topology]], [[logic]] and [[geometry]] are discussed.
