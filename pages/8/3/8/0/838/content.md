A $2$-[[2-category|category]] $C$ is __locally posetal__ or __locally partially ordered__ if every [[hom-category]] $C(x,y)$ is a [[partial order|poset]].  One can also consider a __locally preordered__ $2$-category, where every hom-category is a proset (a [[preorder]]ed set); up to [[equivalence of categories|equivalence]] of $2$-categories, these aren\'t any more general.

Locally posetal $2$-categories are the usual model of $2$-[[2-poset|posets]], aka (1,2)-categories.  Just as the motivating example of a $2$-category is the $2$-category [[Cat]] of categories, so the motivating example of a $2$-poset is the $2$-poset [[Pos]] of posets.  If you interpret $\Pos$ as a [[full subcategory|full sub-2-category]] of $\Cat$, then it is indeed locally posetal.  Similarly, the $2$-category of prosets is a locally preordered $2$-category that is equivalent to $Pos$.

Compare the notion of [[partially ordered category]].  A locally partially ordered category is a category *[[enriched category|enriched]] over* the category [[Pos]] of [[poset]]s, while a partially ordered category is a category *[[internal category|internal]] to* $Pos$.  Similarly, a locally partially ordered category is a special kind of $2$-category, while a partially ordered category is a special kind of [[double category]].
