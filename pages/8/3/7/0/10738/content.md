## Idea

The _Landweber-Novikov theorem_ describes the [[Hopf algebroid]] structure on the dual generalized [[Steenrod algebra]] of the [[complex cobordism cohomology theory]] [[spectrum]] [[MU]].

By [[Quillen's theorem on MU]] we have $\pi_\bullet(MU) \simeq L$, the [[Lazard ring]]. Moreover the dual [[Steenrod algebra]] is 

$$
  MU_{\bullet}(MU) \simeq L B \coloneqq L \otimes \mathbb{Z}[b_1, b_2, \cdots]
$$

where on the right we have the [[polynomial ring]] on generators $b_i$ in degree $2i$. 

Here $(L, L B)$ carries a natural structure of a [[Hopf algebroid]] (and apparently this example is what made [[Haynes Miller]] introduce Hopf algebroids in the first place). The Landweber-Novikov theorem asserts that 
this is the [[Hopf algebroid]] structure on the dual [[MU]]-[[Steenrod algebra]] 

$$
  (\pi_\bullet(MU), MU_\bullet(MU))
  \simeq
  (L, L B)
  \,.
$$

The analog for [[BP]] is the [[Adams-Quillen theorem]].
