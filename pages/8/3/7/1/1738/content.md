Often denoted $\mathbf{2}$ or $I$, the **interval category** is the category with two objects and one nontrivial morphism

$$\overset{0}{\bullet}\to\overset{1}{\bullet}$$

The interval category serves as a combinatorial model for the interval. It is the directed canonical [[interval object]] in [[Cat]].

The notation $\mathbf{2}$ comes from the fact that the interval category is also the [[ordinal number]] $2$ regarded as a category.

It also appears as 

* the first [[oriental]] 

* the [[1-globe]].

* the object $[1]$ in the [[simplex category]] when that is thought of as the full subcategory in [[Cat]] on finite (nonemty) linear [[quiver]]s.

* accordingly, the [[nerve]] of the interval category is the [[simplicial set]] $\Delta^1$ that is [[representable functor|represented by]] $[1] \in \Delta$.

In the context not of categories but of [[groupoid]]s and further that of [[infinity-groupoid]]s the free groupoid on the interval category is relevant, wher the morphism $0 \to 1$ is an [[isomorphism]].

This is the _undirected_ [[interval object]] in [[Cat]] and in [[Grpd]].
