Often denoted $\mathbf{2}$ or $I$, the **interval category** is the category with two objects and one nontrivial morphism

$$\overset{0}{\bullet}\to\overset{1}{\bullet}$$

The interval category serves as a combinatorial model for the interval. It is the directed canonical [[interval object]] in [[Cat]].  It is also called the **walking arrow**.  It might also be called the "arrow category" although that term is [[arrow category|also used]] for a category of functors out of $\mathbf{2}$.

The notation $\mathbf{2}$ comes from the fact that the interval category is also the [[ordinal number]] $2$ regarded as a category.

It also appears as 

* the first [[oriental]] 

* the [[1-globe]].

* the object $[1]$ in the [[simplex category]] when that is thought of as the full subcategory in [[Cat]] on finite (nonemty) linear [[quivers]].

* accordingly, the [[nerve]] of the interval category is the [[simplicial set]] $\Delta^1$ that is [[representable functor|represented by]] $[1] \in \Delta$.


## Interval groupoid

In the context not of categories but of [[groupoids]] and further that of [[∞-groupoids]] the [[free groupoid]] on the interval category is relevant, where the morphism $0 \to 1$ is an [[isomorphism]]. Hence, there is a second morphism, namely it's [[inverse]] $1\to 0$.

$$\overset{0}{\bullet}\leftrightarrows\overset{1}{\bullet}$$

This is the __interval groupoid__, which is the _undirected_ [[interval object]] in [[Cat]] and in [[Grpd]].
