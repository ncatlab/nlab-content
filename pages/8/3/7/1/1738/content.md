Often denoted $\mathbf{2}$ or $I$, the **interval category** is the category with two objects and one nontrivial morphism

$$\overset{0}{\bullet}\to\overset{1}{\bullet}$$

The interval category serves as a combinatorial model for the interval. It is the directed [[interval object]] in [[Cat]].

The notation $\mathbf{2}$ comes from the fact that the interval category is also the [[ordinal number]] $2$ regarded as a category.

It also the first [[oriental]] as well as the [[1-globe]].
