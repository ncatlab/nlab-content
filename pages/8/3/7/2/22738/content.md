## Idea

An algebra with a reciprocal that behaves like $\frac{1}{x}$ in the rational and real numbers.

## Definition

A **reciprocal algebra** is a possibly [[non-associative algebra]] $A$, typically over a [[field]] $k$, which has the property that for non-zero element $b$, there exists an element $c$, called the __[[reciprocal]]__ of $b$, such that for every element $a$

* $a (c b) = a$
* $(c b) a = a$
* $a (b c) = a$
* $(b c) a = a$

## Examples

* Every [[Cayley-Dickson algebra]] is a reciprocal algebra. Examples include the [[real numbers]] $\mathbb{R}$, the [[complex numbers]] $\mathbb{C}$, the [[quaternions]] $\mathbb{H}$, and the [[octonions]] $\mathbb{O}$. 

* The ring of rational [[polynomials]] $\mathbb{R}(X)$ is a real reciprocal algebra.

* There exists a reciprocal algebra with nonzero zero divisors.

### Counter-examples

* There exists a [[division algebra]] with identity that does not have two-sided inverses for every nonzero element.
