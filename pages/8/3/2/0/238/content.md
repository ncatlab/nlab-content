A list of all entries lately edited is given at

* [Recently Revised](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/recently_revised).

But since that list tends to contain lots of very minor changes and does not make it easy to spot the important new changes, in order to facilitate cooperation we here list comments on changes we made. 

Drop a comment here if you feel people's attention should be drawn to some changes you made. For instance alert people of major additions or corrections you made.

These comments should go in _reverse_ chronological order, so that the latest are on top of the list.

* (2009-01-04) [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]:
 
   * added, following email discussion with [[Todd Trimble|Todd]], a discussion to [[sieve]] of which sieves are the presheaf incarnations of which [[cover|covers]], and why

   * adapted [[n-category]] and [[n-groupoid]] to [[Toby Bartels|Toby]]'s [[(n,r)-category]] (which is a great entry -- we should flesh that out further).

   * took the liberty of changing in [[Toby Bartels|Toby]]'s entry [[(n,r)-category]] the "$\omega$-categories" appearing there to "$\infty$-categories", since I thought we did agree that "$\infty$-category" is the generic term while [[omega-category]] specifically means _strict globular $\infty$-category_.

   * separated [[infinity-category]] from [[higher category theory]] and added some brief stub entries such as [[n-category]], [[n-groupoid]] and [[Kan complex]]. 

   * created a _blog_ entry [nLab -- General Discussion](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/01/nlab_general_discussion.html) and added a remark at the beginning of the original _wiki_ entry [[General Discussion]] asking to post further general discussion not to the wiki, but to the blog.

   * rearranged [[tensor product]] following the comments and corrections by [[Toby Bartels|Toby]] and [[Mike Shulman|Mike]] (thanks!).


* (2009-01-03) [[Mike Shulman]]:

  * there is a discussion going on at [[subcategory]] over whether any faithful functor should be called a "subcategory."  Input welcomed.

  * added a comment on terminological objections to [[Grothendieck topology]].

  * corrected the example of abelian groups at [[tensor product]].

  * added examples and comment on non-monoidal closure to [[closed category]]

* (2009-01-03) [[Todd Trimble]]: 

  * added to (and edited) examples under [[closed category]]
  
  * created [[dinatural transformation]]

  * added examples to [[extensive category]]

  * added to the discussion on [[Day convolution]]
 
  * added some detail to the definition of [[Lawvere-Tierney topology]]

* (2009-01-03) [[Urs Schreiber]]: 
 
  * did [[closed category]] and linked to it from Mike's [[cartesian monoidal category]]

  * expanded on [[Day convolution]]

  * split the information previously contained in [[site]] into several separate entries: [[cover]], [[sieve]], [[Grothendieck topology]], [[Lawvere-Tierney topology]] and, of course, [[site]].

* (2009-01-03) [[Mike Shulman]] created [[extensive category]], [[cartesian monoidal category]]  

* (2009-01-02) [[Todd Trimble]] expanded on [[stack]]
and connected it to the discussion of covering sieves at
[[site]] 

* 2009-01-03, [[Toby Bartels]]: I posted [[periodic table]] and [[(n,r)-category]], which I wrote today offline. There are probably lots of typos right now; I don\'t have a lot of time online today. Also, the former one really only contains an appendix that I wanted to write, not so much the article itself. But at least you can read what\'s there now.

* (2009-01-02) [[Todd Trimble]] created [[operad]] 

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]] (2009-01-02): started adding remarks to [[opposite category]] about the big story hidden here related to [[duality]].

* (2009-01-02) [[Todd Trimble]] has expanded on [[site]] and [[sheaf]]. I have started adding a bit more motivational detail to [[site]] and links to [[descent and codescent|descent]], [[stack]] and [[infinity-stack]]. There is still plenty of room here for saying more about this general story.

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]] (2009-01-02): motivated by some [discussion](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/12/organizing_the_pages_at_nlab.html) we had on the blog, in the entry [[About]] I started giving some indications on what the $n$Lab is and what it is not. 

* [[Owen Biesel]] (2009-01-02): added [[diagram]], [[global element]], [[terminal object]], [[limit]], 

* [[Toby Bartels|Toby]] (2008-12-31): I have a precise definition of [[evil]], so I put that in.

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]] (Dec 31): started [[FQFT]], currently just a commented list of literature trying to give an impression of the idea. Also adjusted [[quantum field theory]] and created [[vertex operator algebra]].

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]] (Dec 30): started entries on [[groupoidification]] and [[quantum field theory]].

* [[John Baez|John]] (Dec 29): I'm going to make a little entry about the term [[evil]].

* [[Toby Bartels|Toby]] (Dec 28): I added a bunch of stuff about [[apartness relation|apartness relations]]. (Most of it is probably even correct.) I tried to say as much as I could in terms of enriched category theory, but the topic is really analysis.

* [[John Baez|John]] (Dec 23): I expanded the entry on [[action groupoid]] and started one for [[action]] and [[automorphism]].  In the process I noted that Urs seems to be using $Sets$ for the category of sets, while most mathematicians use [[Set]].  We should settle (pardon the pun) this issue.  I hope that someday there will be lots of entries on specific important categories, listing some of the special features of these categories.

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]] (Dec 23): continued completing "lits of related entries" in the main entries linked to from the [[HomePage]]: did [[Lie theory]] and [[differential geometry]]

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]] (Dec 23): started creating [[nonabelian algebraic topology]] and [[crossed complex]] and expanded a bit related entries linked to from there. Am hoping we can eventually present more details here.

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]] (Dec 22): started replying to a question [[Eric Forgy|Eric]] raised at [[General Discussion]] about the shape of cells used in higher categories. Created [[geometric shapes for higher structures]] with a discussion of the general idea and linked to [[globular set]], [[simplicial set]] and [[cubical set]] from there. Still plenty of room to add details. Am planning to give details on the monoidal structure on cubical sets and the induced Crans-Gray tensor product on $\omega$-[[omega-category|categories]].

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]] (Dec 20): I started to add alphabetical lists of all related entries to the big headline entries that are linked to from the sidebar
of the [[HomePage]]. So far I did this in [[category theory]], [[sheaf and topos theory]], [[foundations]] and [[higher category theory]]. It might be good if each time we create a new entry we think about adding the correspondin link to one of these general lists.

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]] (Dec 20): I replied to the discussion at [[monoidal category]] on "Where does all this structure and  coherence come from?" by adding a subsection on how all this comes from the general concept of $\infty$-[[lax functor]] for which one formalization can be given in terms of [[oriental]]s and Street's [[descent and codescent|descent]]. The pentagon identity is precisely the fourth [[oriental]]! 

* [[Toby Bartels|Toby]] (Dec 20&#8211;23): I won\'t do anything, since I\'ll be travelling. (Just in case you wonder where I am.) 

  * [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: Thanks for the info, Toby. Myself, I will probably be online sporadically over the holidays.

* [[John Baez|John]] (Dec 20): I sketched the definitions of [[monoidal category]], [[braided monoidal category]], and [[symmetric monoidal category]] and gave links to full definitions and explanations.  Is someone good enough at drawing diagrams in this environment to draw the necessary diagrams --- e.g. pentagon and hexagon identity?  

* [[Toby Bartels|Toby]] (Dec 20): More on [[Grothendieck topos]] and [[well-pointed topos]], including definitions that are correct in constructive mathematics.

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: recently, after [[Eric Forgy|Eric]] had requested an "arrow-theoretic" description of [[category algebra]] and of [[graded vector space]]s, I had provided a description in terms of [[bi-brane]]s and remarked that this is part of a bigger picture. That bigger picture, together with these examples, is now described over in my private area at [[schreiber:Nonabelian cocycles and their quantum symmetries]]. For completeness I have added links to that to [[category algebra]] and [[graded vector space]]. Instead of giving the impression of forcing this relation to my work upon these entries, I would like you to understand this as an invitation to check and, if necessary, criticize. 

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: I tried to flesh out [[tensor product]] and [[module]] a bit further, providing more details and attempting to bring the different points of view together. Check.

* [[Toby Bartels]]: I just expanded [[tensor product]], enough to include the example that links to it (without circularity).

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: I expanded on the entry [[action groupoid]] that [[Eric Forgy|Eric]] started.
