[[!include all changes]]

A list of all recently edited entries can be seen here:

* [Recently Revised](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/recently_revised).

But that list tends to contain lots of minor changes: it's not easy to spot the important ones.

So, if you feel people's attention should be drawn to some changes you make, please mention them *here*.  That will help [[Contributors|the rest of us]] spot them, so we can learn what you know --- and maybe make further improvements!

These comments should go in _reverse_ chronological order, so that the latest are on top of the list. To keep the list international, use the date in UTC (the date given by the server for your edits).

#2009-04-11

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:
   *  Wrote [[axiom of foundation]], [[well-founded relation]], and [[well-ordering theorem]].
   *  Added to [[successor]], [[inaccessible cardinal]], [[well-order]], and [[partial function]].
   *  Commented on [[direct sum]], [[presentable (infinity,1)-category]], [[stable (infinity,1)-topos]], [[sequential convergence space]], and [[quantale]].
   *  Moved material from [[Cat]] to [[n-category]].
   *  Moved [[ordinal]] to [[ordinal number]], partly because it\'s more noun-like and partly to match [[cardinal number]].
   *  Moved $1$-categorial material from [[compact object in an (infinity,1)-category]] to [[compact object]].

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]:  Thanks Finn!  It was great to meet you too.  I sliced up your paragraph mentioning fibrations and incorporated the material in other places where I thought it fit better.

* [[Zoran Škoda]]: Created [[Frobenius category]]; added material in [[dg-category]] on dg-modules, Yoneda functor and  "pre-triangulated". One should also explain the pre-triangulated envelope functor.

#2009-04-10

*  [[Finn Lawler]]:

   * Created [[minimal logic]] and [[intuitionistic logic]], as very small stubs.  Introduced yet more broken links there, which I'll fill in later.

   * Slightly corrected Mike's new entry [[type theory]], and added a paragraph mentioning fibrations.  I'm not sure it's in the right place, though.  (PS. Mike: it was great to meet you in Cambridge!  Also, Bruce: thanks for finding me a seat in the restaurant!)

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  I aksed an idle question at [[combinatorial spectrum]] about Kan complexes and $\mathbf{Z}$-groupoids.

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: 

  * Created [[type theory]] with an introduction for category-theorists.  Additions and corrections are welcome.

  * Some improvements and corrections to [[cardinal number]], [[ordinal]], [[well-order]] (what an ugly noun!), [[transitive set]], and [[inaccessible cardinal]], and created [[von Neumann hierarchy]].  In particular, I added the structural point of view to complement the naive and material ones.

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]:

  * added a reference with a remark to [[A-infinity category]]. Would be nice to have more literature here, and more discussion on the relation to [[dg-category]] and [[stable (infinity,1)-category]] 

* [[Zoran Škoda]]: I have made additions to [[cardinal number]]: Urs uses a naive set definition where cardinals are equipotence classes of sets hence his cardinals are proper classes; I follow a choice of representative among ordinals ([[well-order]]ed [[transitive set]]s); to this aim I created [[transitive set]], [[ordinal]], [[successor]], [[inaccessible cardinal]]. In doing this I used some intro parts of my lectures on sheaf theory which I currently teach in Zagreb in Croatian (and which initially started with cardinals, universes and categories). I created [[twisting function]].

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]:

  * added a remark on the $(\infty,1)$-version at [[Dold-Kan correspondence]]

  * created [[accessible (infinity,1)-category]] and [[accessible (infinity,1)-category]], but incomplete

  * created [[compact object in an (infinity,1)-category]], but incomplete

  * created [[cardinal number]] and [[well-order]], but experts should please check these

  * created [[sigma-model]]

  * created an entry [[geometric infinity-function theory]] to go along with the $n$Caf&#233; entry [Journal Club -- Geometric Infinity-Function Theory](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/04/journal_club_geometric_infinit.html)

  * created [[natural numbers object]] just to saturate links (and it should indeed be "natural numbers object", not "natural number object", agreed?)

  * worked comment by [[David Ben-Zvi]] into [[why (infinity,1)-categories?]], but more needs to be done

#2009-04-09

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: 

  * I had been asked by students to say something about why they should care about learning about $(\infty,1)$-categories. I thought that would be a good thing to try to answer in an $n$Lab entry, so I started an entry [[why (infinity,1)-categories?]]. This is just a first attempt. Maybe somebody would enjoy adding his or her own points of views of correcting/improving mine.

  * created [[Connes fusion]], but filled in only pointers to further references

* [[Zoran Škoda]]: created [[von Neumann algebra]] emphasising on sources of relations to category theory and low dimensional topology (particularly G. Segal's program on relations between CFT and elliptic cohomology). There is a good wikipedia entry on von Neumann algebras with lost of references and details, but neglecting the connection to the above topics which should be expanded on. Moreover somebody should mayve write entres on related topics as [[Connes fusion]], [[modular functor]] etc. as those are relevant for some of us.

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  I came to some sort of decision at [[direct sum]].

#2009-04-08

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]:

  attempted a (long-winded) reply to [[David Corfield|David]]s question "What does it mean" at [[Coyoneda lemma]] (and would anyone mind if we renamed that to [[coYoneda lemma]]?)

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: 

  * Following Toby's suggestion, moved [[subsequential space]] to [[sequential convergence space]].  Split [[convergence space]] and [[Cauchy space]] off from [[filter]], and added some stuff about pseudotopological spaces to [[convergence space]].

  * Created [[Reedy category]].

* [[David Corfield|David]]: Created [[Coyoneda lemma]]. What does it mean?

#2009-04-07

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: Created [[subsequential space]] with a bit of propaganda.

* [[Zoran Škoda]]: I created entries [[orbit category]], [[Dold-Thom theorem]] and [[satellite]] with most basic definitions, properties and references, but quickly run out of energy; one should at least add the definition of the morphism part of the satellite functors, the connecting morphism for long exact sequence of satellites, and connection to the Kan extensions. Made some additions to [[Dold-Kan correspondence]].

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  I have a terminological question at [[direct sum]].  (It\'s a rather elementary question in universal algebra.)

#2009-04-06

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: 

  * created [[Deligne cohomology]]

  * reacted to [[Bruce Bartlett|Bruce]]'s question at [[heuristic introduction to sheaves, cohomology and higher stacks]] by expanding further on the notion of morphisms of sheaves

  * expanded slightly at [[AQFT]] -- still just a stub entry, though

  * touched [[combinatorial spectrum]]: replied to [[Mike Shulman|Mike]], expanded the discussion of examples and changed the notation there a bit. But please check. I'll send a request about this to the blog.

  * replied to [[Tim Porter|Tim]]'s comments on [[Zoran Skoda|Zoran]]'s comment at [[differential graded Lie algebra]]

  * replied to the questions that were at [[restriction and extension of sheaves]] (on notation and existence) by adding more details

* [[Tim Porter|Tim]]: 

  * I have adjusted an addition to [[differential graded Lie algebra]]. This used the term 'simply', but it is often not clear that one definition is 'simpler' than another.  'Simplicity' is sometimes clear, but is often in the eye of the beholder. I would love to see some discussion on this as it is an easy trap to fall into (as I know to my cost!) and there are several other similar traps out there which are just as difficult to avoid! Perhaps on the caf&#233;???


#2009-04-05

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]:

  * added a few links to examples at [[space and quantity]] (we have a general problem that many entries created eraly on don't currently point to entries created more recently which de facto they should point to)

  * touched [[combinatorial spectrum]]: replied to [[Mike Shulman|Mike]], added a list of examples and have further questions

#2009-04-04

* [[Tim Porter|Tim]]: 

  * I have put another of the Lexicon series of entries up.  It is [[bar and cobar construction]]. This looks at the differential algebra behind those constructions, and sketches the bar-cobar adjunction. 

  *  I have tried to provide more links to and from this series of 'lexicon' entries. (soon will be finished!)



* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: 

  * further polished [[nonabelian cohomology]]

  * created [[combinatorial spectrum]]

  * expanded [[abelian sheaf cohomology]]

  * created [[cohomology]]

  * created [[heuristic introduction to sheaves, cohomology and higher stacks]]

#2009-04-03

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: 

  * added a bit more details to [[abelian sheaf cohomology]]

  * added discussion of the sheaf version to [[Dold-Kan correspondence]]

  * started an entry [[abelian sheaf cohomology]], but have just the "Idea"-section so far (aiming to provide the right $\infty$-categorical perspective)

  * provided, using [[Todd Trimble|Todd]]'s help, the details on the relations between the two definitions at [[closed monoidal structure on presheaves]] and created a supplementary entry [[functors and comma categories]] on properties of, well, functors on comma categories


#2009-04-02

* [[Tim Porter|Tim]]: 

  * I have put another of the Lexicon series of entries up.  It is [[differential graded Hopf algebra]]. 

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]:

  * reorganized the entry [[mathematics]] a bit -- I am hoping that eventually this becomes a useful top of a small hierarchy of link-list entries which allow the reader to get an idea of the scope of topics covered (and not yet covered) by the $n$Lab, and possibly to facilitate searches by topic rather than by keyword

  * as discussed with [[Timothy Porter]], I created a stub for [[rational homotopy theory]] whose main purpose at the moment is to contain the link list to his lexicon entries on concepts in differential graded algebra

  * created [[closed monoidal structure on presheaves]] and [[closed monoidal structure on sheaves]], but am being dense: have a question at the former

  * created [[direct image]] and [[inverse image]] and [[restriction and extension of sheaves]]

  * moved discussion from [[semi-abelian category]] to [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] and added references

  * added explicit formulas to [[Yoneda extension]] (not the [[end]]-yoga, though)

  * added a question to [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]'s question at [[semi-abelian category]] (probably for [[Tim Porter|Tim]])

  * polished [[infinity-topos]]

#2009-04-01

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]:

  * prodded by [[Tim Porter|Tim]]'s latest comment at [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] I looked up and then created an  entry for [[semi-abelian category]]

* [[Tim Porter|Tim]]: (I seem to remember a request to put more recent changes at the top, even if you have one on today's page so ... .)

  * I have put another of the Lexicon series of entries up.  It is [[differential graded Lie algebra]].

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]

  * created [[infinity-stackification]]

  * added a section "Idea" to [[abelian sheaf]]

  * added a section "Idea" to [[Dold-Kan correspondence]]

  * created [[injective object]]

  * created [[complex]]

  * created [[Grothendieck category]] -- it feels like this should make me say something about that axiom list at [[additive and abelian categories]]...

  * tried to resolve/incorporate parts of the discussion at [[localization]] by reworking the entry a bit -- also left a comment there

  * noticed that we have considerable overlap now between [[multiplicative system]] and [[category of fractions]]. Left a comment there to remind us. Somebody who knows the precise status of these two terms in the math community should please go ahead and merge the material in one entry, keeping a redirect page for the respective other term

* [[Tim Porter|Tim]]:

  * I have added a comment on the terminology [[localization]]. Perhaps an algebraic geometric historical perspective could be useful here to help explain the terminology. (I'm not sure that I am competent to provide this however!)

  * I have put another of the Lexicon series of entries up.  It is [[differential graded coalgebra]].

* [[David Roberts]]:

  * Added [[bicategory of fractions]], [[category of fractions]] and [[wide subcategory]].
  * Started adding the construction of the [[localization]] of a category, as well as a speculative comment at that page on computing this as a [[fundamental category]].

  * Migrated [[2009 March changes|March changes]] 

  * Continued discussion with Urs at my private page [[davidroberts:comments on chapter 2]].
