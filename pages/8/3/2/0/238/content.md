# 2009-03-30

* [[David Roberts]]: 

  * Asked question about Grothendieck's tame topology at [[nice topological space]].

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]:

  * QUESTION: came across MacLane's 
    _Foundations for Categories and Sets_ where it it argued that neither standared set/class set theory nor [[Grothendieck universe]]s provide decent foundations for categories and a formalism of _schools_ is introduced instead -- can anyone comment on that in the light of our discussion at [[Grothendieck universe]]?

  * added an "Idea" section to [[derived functor]] and split off [[derived functor on a derived category]] from that in order to discuss the special homological algebra aspects of derived functors separately -- but incomplete for the moment

  * created [[null system]]

  * created [[category of chain complexes]], but then didn't quite know where to go with this...

  * agreed at [[homological algebra]] and [[filtrant category]]

  * created [[homology]]

  * expanded [[differential object]] and created [[differential]] just to satisfy links

  * created [[matrix calculus]] and [[mapping cone]]

*  [[Tim Porter|Tim]]: 
   *  I have tried to edit [[homological algebra]] somewhat along the lines that my query suggested but taking in ideas from [[Zoran Škoda|Zoran's]] query at that entry.
   * I have added some background material on [[dérivateur]]s on the [[triangulated category]] entry. 
   * I have a **lexicon** for the concepts needed for rational homotopy theory that may be useful.  I have started adding some of this to [[graded vector space]].  My intention is to put quite a lot of routine stuff on this there and elsewhere and then to sort out links, conflicts of notation afterwards. Feedback, queries etc welcome. (They will encourage me to put more of the lexicon on there!)

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:
   *  Wrote [[biproduct]], [[direct sum]], and [[direct product]].
   *  Added more versions to [[additive and abelian categories]].
   *  Questioned the purpose of [[filtrant category]].
   *  I hope that people saw Zoran\'s addition to a query box below.

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: 

  * concerning the entry [[homological algebra]]: [[Tim Porter]] and [[Zoran Skoda]] (or anyone else): please feel free to improve/revise the exposition

  * created [[triangulated category]] -- have a question about _d&#233;rivateurs_ there

  * created [[local epimorphism]]

  * created [[multiplicative system]]

* [[David Roberts]]

  * Uploaded notes on anafunctors to my [web](http://ncatlab.org/davidroberts/show/HomePage). Comments welcome and wanted.

# 2009-03-29

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]:

  * A grammatical suggestion at [[stuff, structure, property]].

  * Did some work on [[chain complex]] and all the [[additive and abelian categories]] pages.

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: 

  * began [[derived category]] before running out of time again...

  * did some layout-editing for [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]'s additions to [[homotopy category of an (infinity,1)-category]]

* [[Finn Lawler]]: Continued experimenting with graphics for diagrams.  Have a look and see what you think:

  * Added some PNGs at [[Kan extension]]

  * Replaced PNGs at [[adjunction]] with larger ones.

* [[David Corfield|David]]

  * asked a question at [[differential object]]

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]

  * started preparing the ground for [[derived category]] and [[triangulated category]] by creating [[category with translation]], [[chain complex]] and [[differential object]] before running out of time...

  * created [[homotopy category of an (infinity,1)-category]]

  * created [[homological algebra]], mainly as a collection of links to the keywords listed there

  * thanks to [[Mike Shulman|Mike]] for his polishing of my original [[filtrant category]] at [[filtered category]]

  * in a first attempt to clean up the entries surrounding [[abelian category]] I created the overview entry [[additive and abelian categories]] and branched off [[Ab-enriched category]], made [[pre-additive category]] a commented redirect to that and "commented out" the respective discussion still to be found at [[additive category]]; also made [[pre-abelian category]] a separate entry, so that now there is in order of increasing structure/property

    * [[pre-additive category]]

    * [[additive category]]

    * [[pre-abelian category]]

    * [[abelian category]]

  * am all in favor of [[Finn Lawler|Finn]]'s graphics! The only reason I don't include nice graphics myself a lot is that currently these take me longer to create than the MathML hacks 

* [[Finn Lawler]]: Uploaded PNG images of the zig-zag identities and added them to [[adjunction]].  They're probably a bit too small, but what do people think of this approach as a work-around until there's an easy way to convert TeX to SVG?  Any other suggestions?
(Note: I tried converting these diagrams to SVG as described [here](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Displaying_a_formula#Commutative_diagrams) but the resulting files were huge and didn't display anyway when inserted into the markdown source.  Instead I used `pdfcrop` and `convert` on the `pdflatex` output.)



# 2009-03-28

* [[Finn Lawler]]:

  * Edited [[linear logic]] in response to Mike's question.

  * Created [[star-autonomous category]].

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: Prompted by discussion with Zoran, created [[strict epimorphism]] and added a lengthier discussion of types of epimorphism to [[epimorphism]].

* [[Zoran Škoda]]: Created [[etale space]]. The order of exposition is important, particularly in view of anticipated additional details. In [[Kan extension]] added a detailed paragraph on an example how left Kan extension pointwise formula has intuitive meaning in the case of constructing pullback for (pre)sheaves on topological spaces. Created [[torsor with structure category]] following the version in Moerdijk's book. 

* [[Finn Lawler]]: Created [[linear logic]] -- just a short stub with
  basic ideas on motivation and models, plus a couple of references.
  Comments effusively welcomed.  (Edit: also removed Thursday's query
  box from [[context]]).

# 2009-03-27

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]:

  * Zoran and I are having a discussion about definitions of [[abelian category]].

  * Redirected [[filtrant category]] to [[filtered category]].

  * Moved the discussion about the word "bimorphism" from [[balanced category]] to [[bimorphism]].

  * Redirected [[parallel morphism]] to [[parallel morphisms]] (which _is_ in line with the naming conventions).

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: 

  * created [[exact functor]]

  * created [[filtrant category]]

  * added to [[Higher Topos Theory]] more introductory/overview remarks which are supposed to be helpful for the newbie

  * created [[Yoneda extension]]

  * added section to [[Kan extension]] on formulas in terms of limits and colimits over comma categories;

  * added a section on the "local" computation of adjoint functors at [[adjoint functor]] and point out how this induces the local/global dichotomy at [[limit]], [[homotopy limit]] and [[Kan extension]] (see my previous modification below)

  * if I noticed correctly, [[Mike Shulman|Mike]] had changed my original notation $p^* := - \circ p : [C',D] \to [C,D]$ for precomposition with a functor $p : C \to C'$ (pullback notation) at [[Kan extension]] to $p_*$ (pushforward notation). I have now added a section _Remark on terminology: pushforward vs. pullback_ which is supposed to clarify this terminology issue.

    +--{: .query}
    [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: That wasn't me.  I'm not sure that such a discussion belongs at [[Kan extension]]; it might belong somewhere but I would rather than the page [[Kan extension]] just pick one notation and possibly link to a discussion.

    [[Zoran Škoda]]: It was me who changed, though I better did not. I am happy with the original notation as well. For as your discussion on pushfowards I am less happy. Namely, if one is not happy with the direction of maps between open sets, one just redefines what is a morphism of sites (opposite to the functor direction), so that the morphism of sites is always correct direction. So, unless one does not have strong feeling on the choice of pushfoward pullback meaning, what is not in this case, mayeb original notation just caring about covariant vs contravariant was better. 
    =--

  * addressed [[Zoran Skoda|Zoran]]'s and [[Tim Porter|Tim]]'s remarks at [[Kan extension]]: I have added now to [[Kan extension]] as well as to [[limit]] -- in analogy to what we already had at [[homotopy limit]] -- an explicit discussion of the difference between _local_ and _global_ definitions of the universal constructions

  * created [[universal construction]] -- but filled in just a question/query

* [[Tim Porter|Tim]]: I have raised a query at [[Kan extension]].

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:
   *  Wrote [[hereditarily finite set]], which is more pretty than useful.
   *  Threatened to rewrite [[Grothendieck universe]] once again.
   *  Wrote about the $3$-way factorisation system at [[stuff, structure, property]].
   *  Accepted Mike\'s terminology ('moderate') at [[Grothendieck universe]].

* [[Zoran Škoda]]: Created [[abelian category]] with multiple equivalent definitions. 

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:
   *  If people don\'t like having several entries in one day per Mike\'s request, another option (hopefully good enough for Mike) is to move your entire list up to the top when you add to it (being sure to add to the top of your list too).
   *  Finn has nothing to apologise for at [[context]].
   *  Zoran and I are discussing terminology at [[projective limit]].
   *  Zoran and Mike are discussing terminology at [[representable functor]] (I only made a more philosophical comment).
   *  Compare [[nice category of spaces]] with [[convenient category of topological spaces]].
   *  I accept Mike\'s terminology at [[set theory]].
   *  I refactored [[kernel]] to use primarily the equaliser definition in any pointed-enriched category.

# 2009-03-26

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]:

  * I have a question about the meaning of "large" at [[Grothendieck universe]].

  * I'd like to request that people not add new sub-bullets under their own names on a given day if other people have since listed more changes above; rather, add a new bullet point at the top with your name.  If that didn't make sense, it's what I'm doing now, rather than (what I could have done) adding a new bullet point below the other copy of my name today.

  * Added some comments on syntactic categories to [[internal logic]], since Toby kindly saved me the work of defining them at [[context]].

* [[Finn Lawler]]: (Hello all -- long-time lurker, first-time editor.)  For my first edit, I asked a silly question at [[context]] and then answered it myself a little later.  I'll delete the query box if nobody has any comments.  Apologies for noise.

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]:

  * Split [[nice category of spaces]] from [[nice topological space]] and fixed all the links I could find.

  * Wrote [[universe in a topos]] by way of responding to the query at [[Grothendieck universe]].

  * Focused [[adjunction]] on the internal version in a 2-category, to distinguish it from [[adjoint functor]], which I reorganized and added a definition to.  (The zig-zag identities are crying out for SVG!)

  * Corrected [[generalized element]] to distinguish it from [[global element]].

  * Made a terminological suggestion at [[set theory]].

  * Commented about property-like structure at [[stuff, structure, property]].  It would be nice to move the examples earlier on this page.


* [[David Corfield|David]]

  * created [[algebraic set theory]]

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]

  * started a stub-entry on [[Stable Infinity-Categories]] (Lurie's PhD part I) and advertized this little program of textbook $n$labification [here](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/01/nlab_general_discussion.html#c022834) at the blog

  * started an entry [[Higher Topos Theory]] (on Lurie's book) in a style analogous to [[Categories and Sheaves]] -- I included a link to [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]'s personal page [[michaelshulman:n-topos for large n|n-topos for large n]]; eventually it would be nice if we had an entry on the general idea and purpose of [[higher topos theory]]

  * started expanding [[Kan extension]]

  * created [[fiber product]], [[parallel morphism]], [[zero morphism]], [[kernel]], added example to [[pointed object]]

  * good to see that [[Mike Shulman|Mike]] is back! Mike, there is a request for you at [[Grothendieck universe]]: can you say something about rephrasing that as a "topos object internal to the [[ETCS]]-version of $Set$"? 

  * added the globular zig-zag diagrams to [[adjunction]]

  * started [[continuous functor]]

  * added a link to [[David Corfield|David]]'s new entry [[algebraic set theory]] at [[set theory]]. It would be nice to put it into context there, eventually.

  * started expanding [[limit]] (and also a bit [[colimit]]): more motivation, more details on definition, more examples

  * created [[generalized element]]

  * more or less completed the hyperlinked keyword list of chapter one of [[Categories and Sheaves]]

  * filled in three equivalent definitions at [[adjoint functor]]

# 2009-03-25

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]

  * expanded a bit at [[natural transformation]]

  * added simple remarks to [[contravariant functor]]

  * added the illustrative diagram to [[over category]] and added a remark on over categories to [[subobject]];

  * added an illustrative diagram to [[comma category]] and added a section there on how a comma category is a pullback;

  * added a little bit of discussion that every presheaf is a colimit of representables to [[presheaf]];

  * expanded a bit more at [[stuff, structure, property]]

# 2009-03-24

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]] 

  * have more stupid questions (for [[Toby Bartels|Toby]], probably) at [[Grothendieck universe]] and incorporated more of Toby's replies

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:
   *  Gave a structural definition at [[Grothendieck universe]], but somebody should check it (Mike, this means you).
   *  Some more foundational material, including [[set theory]], [[pure set]], and [[point]] (which is a bit purple).
   *  Note that Urs also started [[stuff, structure, property]].

# 2009-03-23

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: created [[Grothendieck universe]] -- but have questions. Mentioned Grothendieck universes at [[small category]] and [[locally small category]].

# 2009-03-22

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  I added a section on morphisms between [[context]]s (the substitutions, or interpretations), including (as an example) a complete description of the category of contexts of the theory of a group.  There is an exercise (to describe that category in group-theoretic terms) whose formatting all authors might want to look at.

# 2009-03-21

* [[Tim Porter|Tim]]: 

   * I added a link to p-adic solenoid in [[shape theory]] as that example gives insights on the links between this area and dynamical systems.

# 2009-03-20

* [[Andrew Stacey]]: lifted the tangent/cotangent section from "Comparative Smootheology" to [[Froelicher space]].  I intend to remove this section from that paper and this seems like a good place to put and develop it.

* [[Zoran Škoda]]: created [[algebraic monad]], [[generalized ring]], [[compact object]], [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]], [[spectrum (geometry)]], [[Pierce spectrum]], [[filter]] (thanks Mike for an essential typographic correction), [[generator]], [[cogenerator]] (the latter were prompted by editing [[Morita equivalence]], paragraph on classical Morita). Zoran and Toby distributed the paragraph on ultrafilters from long growing entry [[filter]] partly to the new entry [[ultrafilter]]. Uploaded [[warsaw.gif:file]] with link within [[shape theory]].

# 2009-03-19

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]

  * followed [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]'s remark and moved the previous content in [[stable infinity-category]] to [[stable (infinity,1)-category]], keeping just a general nonsense statement at [[stable infinity-category]]

  * added a remark on this and a link at [[spectrum]]


* [[Zoran Škoda]]: moved the earlier material from entry algebra to new entry [[associative unital algebra]], and put new material into [[algebra]]; one should have separate entry for any framework for algebras, and general entry [[algebra]] should have pointers to the major classes (like [[algebra over operad]]). Thanks Toby, we continue together on that: now there is an entry [[nonassociative algebra]] and so on. I have also addressed concerns of Mike in [[Connes' cyclic category]] which now has I hope correct definitions, plus more foundational issues and relevant literature and link to just uploaded file  [[krasauskas.pdf:file]]

* [[Andrew Stacey|Andrew]]: Added some more to [[Froelicher space]].  I've started on a new project on this: adapting topological notions to Froelicher spaces.

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: 
  
  * created [[stable infinity-category]]

  * implemented [[Zoran Skoda|Zoran]]'s remark below by rephrasing a bit at [[Categories and Sheaves]]

  * added a bit more to [[large category]]

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  Let [[specialization topology]] lead me to [[specialization order]].

* [[David Roberts]]:

  * Created [[Grothendieck's Galois theory]]

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]:

  * Removed the discussion about accented characters from   [[fundamental group of a topos]] and put it in the [[FAQ]].

  * Displayed my happiness at [[quotient object]] by removing the discussion.

# 2009-03-18

* [[Zoran Škoda]] has created [[dense subcategory]] (intentionally organized different than the entry for the entry for slight generalization, [[dense functor]]); created [[shape theory]] but needs much more work; I copied here references from [[fundamental group of a topos]] (plus to a Batanin's article) and in [[fundamental group of a topos]] I added the reference and link to Pataraia's article important for the abstract notion of fundamental groupoid in internal contexts. 

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: 

  * created an entry on the book [[Categories and Sheaves]] (comment you say that "sheaf condition is localization" there; well the category of sheaves is a localization of the category of presheaves, but the sheaf condition...you really meant what you say? -- Zoran)

  * in reaction to [[Toby Bartels|Toby]]'s discussion at [[large category]] I created entries for [[accessible category]], [[locally presentable category]] and [[sketch]]. But very incomplete.

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  Started a discussion about [[large category]].

* [[Andrew Stacey|Andrew]]:

  * More done on [[Froelicher space]]s.  I think that I have finally figured out the relationship between Fr&#246;licher spaces and Isbell duality so if anyone else is interested in taking a look I'd appreciate your comments.

    I also found the standard layout of the page a little hard to work with, in particular with regard to delimiting proofs and definitions (both of which could get quite long) so I've been experimenting with alternative ways of demarking them (on [[Froelicher space]]).  Let me know if you like or dislike what you see.

* [[David Corfield|David]]:

  * Added a reference in response to one of Mike's questions at [[fundamental group of a topos]].

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]:

  * Created [[quantale]], [[adjoint functor theorem]], and [[total category]].
  * Asked some questions at [[fundamental group of a topos]].

* [[Tim Porter|Tim]]: 

   * Created [[fundamental group of a topos]].  At present this is lifted / adapted from an article I wrote some time ago so needs some attention.  (This necessary attention includes fixing some diacriticals on some names.)

# 2009-03-17

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]:

  * Yes, homotopy theorists call a [[k-tuply groupal n-groupoid]] a _grouplike $E_k$-space_.

  * Continued discussion at [[Crans-Gray tensor product]].

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:
   *  Wrote [[congruence]] to mean an internal equivalence relation.
   *  Wrote [[k-tuply groupal n-groupoid]] based on [[k-tuply monoidal n-category]].  But I strongly suspect that homotopy theorists have something to say here in a completely different language.  (Perhaps [[Mike Shulman]] knows.)
   *  Created [[wedge sum]] to link from the following, and [[smash product]] to go with it.
   *  Put in a general definition at [[homotopy group]], trying to show how $\pi_n$ has $n$ products that are all the same.

* [[Tim Porter|Tim]]: I have been trying to give an adequate categorical treatment of [[profinite completion of a group]].

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: 

  * made a little remark on [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]'s question at [[Crans-Gray tensor product]] and ask another question myself

  * added a remark to [[Waldhausen category]] on its relation to [[category of fibrant objects]] and ask a [question](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/01/nlab_general_discussion.html#c022572) about the precise statement to be made here over at the $n$Caf&#233;

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  Combined [[proset]] into [[preorder]], etc, as planned there.

* [[Andrew Stacey|Andrew]]:

  * Shifted [[generalized object|generalised object]] to [[Isbell envelope]] in line with the comments from the categories mailing list.  Mainly just altered the terminology in line with this nomenclature, but added a small section on how it relates to profunctors as well.
  * Modified [[Froelicher space]] a little as well in line with the Isbell envelope nomenclature.

* [[Zoran Škoda]] created [[Waldhausen category]] and made a remark into entry [[cofibration category]]. 

* [[Toby Bartels]]:  I created [[symmetric set]] out of material that [[Zoran Škoda]] added to [[FinSet]].

# 2009-03-16

* [[Toby Bartels]]:  Tired of writing `[[constructivism|constructive mathematics]]`, I moved [[constructivism]] to [[constructive mathematics]] and fixed links.  Similarly, I moved [[predicativism]] to [[predicative mathematics]].  After some thought, I also moved [[finitism]] to [[finite mathematics]] and expanded it a bit to fit the new name better.  To go with this, I finally created [[FinSet]].

* [[Zoran Škoda|Zoran]]: Created [[Loday-Pirashvili category]], [[dense functor]] and [[equivariant object]]. There are two different notions of dense subcategory, first of which has two different definitions and is related to colimits and nerve functor, and second which is related to pro-objects. In the entry [[Bousfield localization]] I added a paragraph on Bousfield localization for triangulated categories; made changes to [[nerve]] (more to be done: one needs to clarify the example of geometric realization etc.). 

* [[Tim Porter|Tim]]: 
  * I have put a request on [[Loday-Pirashvili category]] for some discussion of the links between the ideas here and those in [[2-vector space]], as there is overlap.
  * I have started a discussion on the exposition of [[dg-algebra]]. My preferred approach is via graded object,  differential algebra and  chain complex. The present approach I find a bit confusing.
  * In [[profinite completion of a group]], I have pointed out a difference in the use of the term [[profinite group]], that may need discussion.

# 2009-03-15

* [[Zoran Škoda|Zoran]]: Created (in last two days) several entries mainly related to co- Hopf- algebras and algebras in categories of chain complexes: [[Frechet-Uryson space]], [[Hopf module]], [[Hopf-Galois extension]], [[Maurer-Cartan equation]], [[category of elements]], [[compactly generated space]], [[coring]], [[dg-algebra]],[[distributive law]], [[torsor]] (very unfinished!), [[twisted module of homomorphisms]], [[twisted tensor product]], [[twisting cochain]] and made changes to few other entries including many changes in entry [[Hopf algebra]] and some in [[A-infinity-algebra]]. With the (Fukaya) convention used there $D_0$ should not exist.

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: Created [[homotopy equivalence]] and [[weak homotopy equivalence]].

* [[Tim Porter|Tim]]: 

  * created [[I-category]] which includes an alternative axiomatisation of [[cylinder functor]].  This is needed for Baues' version of abstract homotopy theory. Some results and examples will need to be added later.


# 2009-03-14

* [[Bruce Bartlett]] has created [[nInsights]].

* [[Ronnie Brown]]: I've rewritten and expanded [[homotopy group]]s partly to clarify the operation of dimension 1 on higher dimensions  and to emphasise the groupoid aspects. 

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  I\'ve written [[sequence]], [[net]], [[multi-valued function]], [[partial function]], and the long-delayed [[surjection]] and [[injection]].  Those interested in foundations may be particularly interested in my proposed alternative definition of [[sequence]].

*  [[Tim Porter|Tim]]: I have included a discussion of the nerve of an [[internal category]] at that entry.

# 2009-03-13

*  [[Tim Porter|Tim]]: I have changed the initial sentence of [[homotopy n-type]].  I think this is converging well thanks to the efforts of Mike and Toby. 

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  Since we already have [[fundamental groupoid]] and even [[fundamental infinity-groupoid]], I started [[fundamental group]] and [[homotopy group]].  But I only wrote #Idea# sections.

# 2009-03-12

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]:

  * Responded at [[homotopy n-type]] and [[proset]].

  * Did a little more bettering of [[profinite group]], and was inspired to create [[filtered category]], [[pro-object]], [[ind-object]], and (as stubs) [[free completion]] and [[topological group]].

*  [[Tim Porter|Tim]]:
    * I have edited [[homotopy type]] as recent changes seem to have altered the idea away from the usual one making it perhaps too narrow.  A similar problem seems to occur with [[homotopy n-type]] and I have raised a terminological query there as well.
   * In [[homotopy n-type]] I have also queried the use of 'nice space' and its relation with [[nice topological space]].  This latter entry is perhaps misnamed as it is really the category of these spaces that is nice rather than the spaces themselves.
   *  I have raised a question on *Disambiguation* at [[proset]].  Have we a policy as to how to handle  terms with perfectly acceptable multiple meanings?
   *  I have tried to 'better' the previous entry on [[profinite group]]! (see the old version to see why I say it this way.)

* [[Mike Shulman]]: A question about the [[Crans-Gray tensor product]].

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:
   *  Broke [[undirected object]] off of [[directed object]] as planned.  Discussion stayed at [[directed object]], even though it discusses both concepts (and that of a [[directed space]]).
   *  Finally wrote [[full subcategory]] and directed links to it.
   *  I\'ve continued the conversation that [[Eric Forgy]] started at [[preorder]].
   *  I have my own terminological question at [[linear relation]].

# 2009-03-11

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: I have a suggestion for a terminological change at [[k-tuply monoidal n-category]].

# 2009-03-10


* [[Tim Porter]]:  

  * Eventually we probably need a summary of some of the theory of algebraic homotopy that Baues has developed as if impinges on the [[homotopy hypothesis]] and on [[homotopical cohomology theory]].  To this end I have created a sort of historical entry on [[algebraic homotopy]].  

  *  Created [[cofibration category]] as the first of the 'Bauesian' detailed entries.


* [[Toby Bartels]]:  I\'ve written several more articles on very basic topics, such as those that used to be '?'-links below.  You can see them on Recently Revised; I don\'t think that anything merits great attention.

# 2009-03-09

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  I finally wrote [[relation]], which makes me realise that there is no [[subset]] yet ....  Also [[order]], but that\'s just a list of links to more specific pages.

# 2009-03-08

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  I tried to clarify the difference between a [[preorder]] (a structure on a given set that satisfies certain properties) and a [[proset]] (a set equipped with such a structure).  I need to finish that for [[partial order]]/[[poset]] and [[total order]]/[[toset]], although I would also entertain the idea that these should all be redirected one way or the other.  But I got sidetracked writing [[linear order]] and [[loset]] instead.  (And then there\'s [[quasiorder]]; I don\'t think that [[quoset]] is necessary for reasons that I don\'t want to get into here.)

* [[John Baez]]:

  * Attempted to answer Eric's plea for a category-theoretic definition of 'Hasse diagram', in the discussion at the bottom of [[preorder]].  Unfortunately I don't know the official definition of 'Hasse diagram' --- though I know one when I see one.

  * Made a short page on [[proset]], since Toby seems to be using this as a synonym for [[preorder]].

# 2009-03-05

* [[Andrew Stacey]]:

  * Continued debate on what to call "[[generalized object|generalised object]]" since there seem to be some generalised objections (sorry).

# 2009-03-03

* [[Andrew Stacey]]:
  * Archived February
  * Started [[generalized object]]

* [[Toby Bartels]]:  Since Urs is using both 'over category' and 'over-category' (and not 'slice category'), I tried to standardise things as 'over category' to diminish the temptation to slip further into 'over-category'.  Principally this means that I moved [[slice category]] to [[over category]] and [[over-category in quasi-categories]] to [[over quasi-category]].

# 2009-03-02

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]

  * created [[limit in quasi-categories]] and in the course of saturating links from there also created [[join of simplicial sets]], [[join of categories]], [[join of quasi-categories]], [[over-category in quasi-categories]], [[terminal object in a quasi-category]] and edited [[quasi-category]] itself a bit

# 2009-03-01

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:
   *  Slightly revised [[Tim Porter]]\'s new introduction to [[homotopy 2-type]] and copied it (with appropriate changes) to [[homotopy 1-type]] and [[homotopy 3-type]].  Also combined it with what was already at [[homotopy n-type]], so that has the most complete discussion of the issues.
   *  Created a bunch of articles on specific notions of $n$-category, especially for $n \leq 3$: [[3-poset]], [[3-groupoid]], [[n-poset]], [[2-poset]], [[locally posetal 2-category]], [[2-groupoid]], [[1-category]], [[1-poset]], [[1-groupoid]], [[(-2)-groupoid]], [[(-1)-poset]].  Similarly, I moved some material from [[(-1)-groupoid]] to [[truth value]] to fit the purposes of the former page (as explained in old discussion that was also moved).
   *  Spun [[simplicial groupoid]] off of [[simplicially enriched category]].  Experts please check that the definitions there (based somewhat on a remark in [[Dwyer-Kan loop groupoid]]) are correct.
