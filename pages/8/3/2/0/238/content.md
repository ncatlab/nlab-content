A list of all entries lately edited is given at

* [Recently Revised](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/recently_revised).

But since that list tends to contain lots of very minor changes and does not make it easy to spot the important new changes, in order to facilitate cooperation [[Contributors|we]] here list comments on changes we made. 

Drop a comment here if you feel people's attention should be drawn to some changes you made. For instance alert people of major additions or corrections you made.

These comments should go in _reverse_ chronological order, so that the latest are on top of the list. To keep the list international, use the date in UTC (the date given by the server for your edits).

# 2009-02-06

* [[David Roberts]]:
   
  * Edited [[anafunctor]] to clean up conditions on covers, and some explanations of what each one is for.

  * Created the page [[Grothendieck pretopology]]


# 2009-02-05

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]:

  * Continued discussion with Urs at [[hyperstructure]].

  * Moved [[thin]] to [[thin element]] in line with the [[HowTo|naming convention]] that page names be singular nouns.  Also added some other contexts in which "thinness" appears.

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]

  * replied to [[Mike Shulman|Mike]] at [[hyperstructure]] 

# 2009-02-04

* [[Ronnie Brown]]

  * added discussion of _strict versions of higher homotopy groupoids_ to [[fundamental infinity-groupoid]]

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]:

  * added a "laboratory section" to [[hyperstructure]] in which I am proposing a formalization of the concept

  * created [[dagger category]]; started filling [[dagger compact category]] with content

# 2009-02-03

* [[Andrew Stacey|Andrew]]

  * Implemented the archive of latest changes (scroll down to the bottom of this page to get the link)
  * Added a fair bit more on Isbell Duality in [[Froelicher space]]s.  A few more general queries for those a little more versed in the lore of categories than me.

# 2009-02-02

* [[Eric Forgy|Eric]]

  * created [[Position, Velocity, and Acceleration]] to help augment the discussion going on at the [n-Cafe](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/01/the_third_time_is_the_charm.html#c021749)

* [[Andrew Stacey|Andrew]]: continued with [[Froelicher space]]s.  In particular, laid out some of the details of the Isbell duality proof.

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]

  * added as a further example the computation of 
   $holim(\mathbf{B}H \to \mathbf{B}G \leftarrow \mathbf{B}H) \simeq H \backslash\backslash G // H$ to [[homotopy limit]]

  * many thanks to [[Mike Shulman|Mike]] and [[Timothy Porter|Tim]] for all the further details at [[homotopy limit]]! 

  * re [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]'s suggestion: yes, I'd be in favor of archiving the latest changes list here more frequently 

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]:

  * Answered Urs's question in a very long-winded way by adding lots of stuff to [[homotopy limit]].
  * What would people think about rotating (i.e. archiving) the [[latest changes]] every month, rather than every year?  It's pretty big right now and it will probably be immense by next December.

# 2009-02-01

* [[Andrew Stacey|Andrew]]: After crashing the [[HomePage|nLab]] 3 times I've finally managed to upload something on [[Froelicher space|Frolicher spaces]].  Something is seriously wrong with my syntax - if no one's taken pity on me and cleaned it up I'll do so myself tomorrow.  More importantly, I have a few queries for the more experienced categorists so I'd appreciate someone taking a look at those for me.

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: thanks, [[Mike Shulman|Mike]], very useful. Is anything similar known for 3-categories?
