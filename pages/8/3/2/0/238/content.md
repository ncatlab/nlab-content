Let's list here comments on changes we made in order to facilitate cooperation. For instance drop a comment here to alert people of major additions or corrections you made.

Let's list comments in _reverse_ chronological order, so that the latest are on top of the list.

* [[John Baez|John]] (Dec 20): I sketched the definitions of [[monoidal category]], [[braided monoidal category]], and [[symmetric monoidal category]] and gave links to full definitions and explanations.  Is someone good enough at drawing diagrams in this environment to draw the necessary diagrams --- e.g. pentagon and hexagon identity?  

* [[Toby Bartels|Toby]] (Dec 20): More on [[Grothendieck topos]] and [[well-pointed topos]], including definitions that are correct in constructive mathematics.

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: recently, after [[Eric Forgy|Eric]] had requested an "arrow-theoretic" description of [[category algebra]] and of [[graded vector space]]s, I had provided a description in terms of [[bi-brane]]s and remarked that this is part of a bigger picture. That bigger picture, together with these examples, is now described over in my private area at [[schreiber:Nonabelian cocycles and their quantum symmetries]]. For completeness I have added links to that to [[category algebra]] and [[graded vector space]]. Instead of giving the impression of forcing this relation to my work upon these entries, I would like you to understand this as an invitation to check and, if necessary, criticize. 

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: I tried to flesh out [[tensor product]] and [[module]] a bit further, providing more details and attempting to bring the different points of view together. Check.

* [[Toby Bartels]]: I just expanded [[tensor product]], enough to include the example that links to it (without circularity).

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: I expanded on the entry [[action groupoid]] that [[Eric Forgy|Eric]] started.
