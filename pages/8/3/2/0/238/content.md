[[!include all changes]]

A list of all recently edited entries can be seen here:

* [Recently Revised](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/recently_revised).

But that list tends to contain lots of minor changes: it's not easy to spot the important ones.

So, if you feel people's attention should be drawn to some changes you make, please mention them *here*.  That will help [[Contributors|the rest of us]] spot them, so we can learn what you know --- and maybe make further improvements!

These comments should go in _reverse_ chronological order, so that the latest are on top of the list. To keep the list international, use the date in UTC (the date given by the server for your edits).

#2009-04-01

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]

  * added a section "Idea" to [[Dold-Kan correspondence]]

  * created [[injective object]]

  * created [[complex]]

  * created [[Grothendieck category]] -- it feels like this should make me say something about that axiom list at [[additive and abelian categories]]...

  * tried to resolve/incorporate parts of the discussion at [[localization]] by reworking the entry a bit -- also left a comment there

  * noticed that we have considerable overlap now between [[multiplicative system]] and [[category of fractions]]. Left a comment there to remind us. Somebody who knows the precise status of these two terms in the math community should please go ahead and merge the material in one entry, keeping a redirect page for the respective other term

* [[Tim Porter|Tim]]:

  * I have added a comment on the terminology [[localization]]. Perhaps an algebraic geometric historical perspective could be useful here to help explain the terminology. (I'm not sure that I am competent to provide this however!)

  * I have put another of the Lexicon series of entries up.  It is [[differential graded coalgebra]].

* [[David Roberts]]:

  * Added [[bicategory of fractions]], [[category of fractions]] and [[wide subcategory]].
  * Started adding the construction of the [[localization]] of a category, as well as a speculative comment at that page on computing this as a [[fundamental category]].

  * Migrated [[2009 March changes|March changes]] 

  * Continued discussion with Urs at my private page [[davidroberts:comments on chapter 2]].
