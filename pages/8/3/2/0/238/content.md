[[!include all changes]]

A list of all recently edited entries can be seen here:

* [Recently Revised](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/recently_revised).

But that list tends to contain lots of minor changes: it's not easy to spot the important ones.

So, if you feel people's attention should be drawn to some changes you make, please mention them *here*.  That will help [[Contributors|us]] spot them, so we can learn what you know --- and maybe make further improvements!

These comments should go in _reverse_ chronological order, so that the latest are on top of the list. To keep the list international, use the date in UTC (the date given by the server for your edits).

# 2009-03-16

* [[Zoran Škoda|Zoran]]: Created [[Loday-Pirashvili category]] and [[equivariant object]]. In the entry [[Bousfield localization]] I added a paragraph on Bousfield localization for triangulated categories. 

* [[Tim Porter|Tim]]: 
  * I have put a request on [[Loday-Pirashvili category]] for some discussion of the links between the ideas here and those in [[2-vector-space]], as there is overlap.
  * I have started a discussion on the exposition of [[dg-algebra]]. My preferred approach is via graded object,  differential algebra and  chain complex. The present approach I find a bit confusing.
  * In [[profinite completion]], I have pointed out a difference in the use of the term [[profinite group]], that may need discussion.

# 2009-03-15

* [[Zoran Škoda|Zoran]]: Created (in last two days) several entries mainly related to co- Hopf- algebras and algebras in categories of chain complexes: [[Frechet-Uryson space]], [[Hopf module]], [[Hopf-Galois extension]], [[Maurer-Cartan equation]], [[category of elements]], [[compactly generated space]], [[coring]], [[dg-algebra]],[[distributive law]], [[torsor]] (very unfinished!), [[twisted module of homomorphisms]], [[twisted tensor product]], [[twisting cochain]] and made changes to few other entries including many changes in entry [[Hopf algebra]] and some in [[A-infinity-algebra]]. With the (Fukaya) convention used there $D_0$ should not exist.

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: Created [[homotopy equivalence]] and [[weak homotopy equivalence]].

* [[Tim Porter|Tim]]: 

  * created [[I-category]] which includes an alternative axiomatisation of [[cylinder functor]].  This is needed for Baues' version of abstract homotopy theory. Some results and examples will need to be added later.


# 2009-03-14

* [[Bruce Bartlett]] has created [[nInsights]].

* [[Ronnie Brown]]: I've rewritten and expanded [[homotopy group]]s partly to clarify the operation of dimension 1 on higher dimensions  and to emphasise the groupoid aspects. 

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  I\'ve written [[sequence]], [[net]], [[multi-valued function]], [[partial function]], and the long-delayed [[surjection]] and [[injection]].  Those interested in foundations may be particularly interested in my proposed alternative definition of [[sequence]].

*  [[Tim Porter|Tim]]: I have included a discussion of the nerve of an [[internal category]] at that entry.

# 2009-03-13

*  [[Tim Porter|Tim]]: I have changed the initial sentence of [[homotopy n-type]].  I think this is converging well thanks to the efforts of Mike and Toby. 

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  Since we already have [[fundamental groupoid]] and even [[fundamental infinity-groupoid]], I started [[fundamental group]] and [[homotopy group]].  But I only wrote #Idea# sections.

# 2009-03-12

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]:

  * Responded at [[homotopy n-type]] and [[proset]].

  * Did a little more bettering of [[profinite group]], and was inspired to create [[filtered category]], [[pro-object]], [[ind-object]], and (as stubs) [[free completion]] and [[topological group]].

*  [[Tim Porter|Tim]]:
    * I have edited [[homotopy type]] as recent changes seem to have altered the idea away from the usual one making it perhaps too narrow.  A similar problem seems to occur with [[homotopy n-type]] and I have raised a terminological query there as well.
   * In [[homotopy n-type]] I have also queried the use of 'nice space' and its relation with [[nice topological space]].  This latter entry is perhaps misnamed as it is really the category of these spaces that is nice rather than the spaces themselves.
   *  I have raised a question on *Disambiguation* at [[proset]].  Have we a policy as to how to handle  terms with perfectly acceptable multiple meanings?
   *  I have tried to 'better' the previous entry on [[profinite group]]! (see the old version to see why I say it this way.)

* [[Mike Shulman]]: A question about the [[Crans-Gray tensor product]].

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:
   *  Broke [[undirected object]] off of [[directed object]] as planned.  Discussion stayed at [[directed object]], even though it discusses both concepts (and that of a [[directed space]]).
   *  Finally wrote [[full subcategory]] and directed links to it.
   *  I\'ve continued the conversation that [[Eric Forgy]] started at [[preorder]].
   *  I have my own terminological question at [[linear relation]].

# 2009-03-11

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: I have a suggestion for a terminological change at [[k-tuply monoidal n-category]].

# 2009-03-10


* [[Tim Porter]]:  

  * Eventually we probably need a summary of some of the theory of algebraic homotopy that Baues has developed as if impinges on the [[homotopy hypothesis]] and on [[homotopical cohomology theory]].  To this end I have created a sort of historical entry on [[algebraic homotopy]].  

  *  Created [[cofibration category]] as the first of the 'Bauesian' detailed entries.


* [[Toby Bartels]]:  I\'ve written several more articles on very basic topics, such as those that used to be '?'-links below.  You can see them on Recently Revised; I don\'t think that anything merits great attention.

# 2009-03-09

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  I finally wrote [[relation]], which makes me realise that there is no [[subset]] yet ....  Also [[order]], but that\'s just a list of links to more specific pages.

# 2009-03-08

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  I tried to clarify the difference between a [[preorder]] (a structure on a given set that satisfies certain properties) and a [[proset]] (a set equipped with such a structure).  I need to finish that for [[partial order]]/[[poset]] and [[total order]]/[[toset]], although I would also entertain the idea that these should all be redirected one way or the other.  But I got sidetracked writing [[linear order]] and [[loset]] instead.  (And then there\'s [[quasiorder]]; I don\'t think that [[quoset]] is necessary for reasons that I don\'t want to get into here.)

* [[John Baez]]:

  * Attempted to answer Eric's plea for a category-theoretic definition of 'Hasse diagram', in the discussion at the bottom of [[preorder]].  Unfortunately I don't know the official definition of 'Hasse diagram' --- though I know one when I see one.

  * Made a short page on [[proset]], since Toby seems to be using this as a synonym for [[preorder]].

# 2009-03-05

* [[Andrew Stacey]]:

  * Continued debate on what to call "[[generalized object|generalised object]]" since there seem to be some generalised objections (sorry).

# 2009-03-03

* [[Andrew Stacey]]:
  * Archived February
  * Started [[generalized object]]

* [[Toby Bartels]]:  Since Urs is using both 'over category' and 'over-category' (and not 'slice category'), I tried to standardise things as 'over category' to diminish the temptation to slip further into 'over-category'.  Principally this means that I moved [[slice category]] to [[over category]] and [[over-category in quasi-categories]] to [[over quasi-category]].

# 2009-03-02

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]

  * created [[limit in quasi-categories]] and in the course of saturating links from there also created [[join of simplicial sets]], [[join of categories]], [[join of quasi-categories]], [[over-category in quasi-categories]], [[terminal object in a quasi-category]] and edited [[quasi-category]] itself a bit


# 2009-03-01

[[Toby Bartels]]:
*  Slightly revised [[Tim Porter]]\'s new introduction to [[homotopy 2-type]] and copied it (with appropriate changes) to [[homotopy 1-type]] and [[homotopy 3-type]].  Also combined it with what was already at [[homotopy n-type]], so that has the most complete discussion of the issues.
*  Created a bunch of articles on specific notions of $n$-category, especially for $n \leq 3$: [[3-poset]], [[3-groupoid]], [[n-poset]], [[2-poset]], [[locally posetal 2-category]], [[2-groupoid]], [[1-category]], [[1-poset]], [[1-groupoid]], [[(-2)-groupoid]], [[(-1)-poset]].  Similarly, I moved some material from [[(-1)-groupoid]] to [[truth value]] to fit the purposes of the former page (as explained in old discussion that was also moved).
*  Spun [[simplicial groupoid]] off of [[simplicially enriched category]].  Experts please check that the definitions there (based somewhat on a remark in [[Dwyer-Kan loop groupoid]]) are correct.
