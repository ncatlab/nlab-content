A list of all entries lately edited is given at 


* [Recently Revised](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/recently_revised). 

But since that list tends to contain lots of very minor changes and does not make it easy to spot the important new changes, in order to facilitate cooperation we here list comments on changes we made. 

Drop a comment here if you feel people's attention should be drawn to some changes you made. For instance alert people of major additions or corrections you made.

These comments should go in _reverse_ chronological order, so that the latest are on top of the list.

* [[Toby Bartels|Toby]] (Dec 28): I added a bunch of stuff about [[apartness relation|apartness relations]]. (Most of it is probably even correct.) I tried to say as much as I could in terms of enriched category theory, but the topic is really analysis.

* [[John Baez|John]] (Dec 23): I expanded the entry on [[action groupoid]] and started one for [[action]] and [[automorphism]].  In the process I noted that Urs seems to be using $Sets$ for the category of sets, while most mathematicians use [[Set]].  We should settle (pardon the pun) this issue.  I hope that someday there will be lots of entries on specific important categories, listing some of the special features of these categories.

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]] (Dec 23): continued completing "lits of related entries" in the main entries linked to from the [[HomePage]]: did [[Lie theory]] and [[differential geometry]]

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]] (Dec 23): started creating [[nonabelian algebraic topology]] and [[crossed complex]] and expanded a bit related entries linked to from there. Am hoping we can eventually present more details here.

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]] (Dec 22): started replying to a question [[Eric Forgy|Eric]] raised at [[General Discussion]] about the shape of cells used in higher categories. Created [[geometric shapes for higher structures]] with a discussion of the general idea and linked to [[globular set]], [[simplicial set]] and [[cubical set]] from there. Still plenty of room to add details. Am planning to give details on the monoidal structure on cubical sets and the induced Crans-Gray tensor product on $\omega$-[[omega-category|categories]].

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]] (Dec 20): I started to add alphabetical lists of all related entries to the big headline entries that are linked to from the sidebar
of the [[HomePage]]. So far I did this in [[category theory]], [[sheaf and topos theory]], [[foundations]] and [[higher category theory]]. It might be good if each time we create a new entry we think about adding the correspondin link to one of these general lists.

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]] (Dec 20): I replied to the discussion at [[monoidal category]] on "Where does all this structure and  coherence come from?" by adding a subsection on how all this comes from the general concept of $\infty$-[[lax functor]] for which one formalization can be given in terms of [[oriental]]s and Street's [[descent and codescent|descent]]. The pentagon identity is precisely the fourth [[oriental]]! 

* [[Toby Bartels|Toby]] (Dec 20&#8211;23): I won\'t do anything, since I\'ll be travelling. (Just in case you wonder where I am.) 

  * [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: Thanks for the info, Toby. Myself, I will probably be online sporadically over the holidays.

* [[John Baez|John]] (Dec 20): I sketched the definitions of [[monoidal category]], [[braided monoidal category]], and [[symmetric monoidal category]] and gave links to full definitions and explanations.  Is someone good enough at drawing diagrams in this environment to draw the necessary diagrams --- e.g. pentagon and hexagon identity?  

* [[Toby Bartels|Toby]] (Dec 20): More on [[Grothendieck topos]] and [[well-pointed topos]], including definitions that are correct in constructive mathematics.

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: recently, after [[Eric Forgy|Eric]] had requested an "arrow-theoretic" description of [[category algebra]] and of [[graded vector space]]s, I had provided a description in terms of [[bi-brane]]s and remarked that this is part of a bigger picture. That bigger picture, together with these examples, is now described over in my private area at [[schreiber:Nonabelian cocycles and their quantum symmetries]]. For completeness I have added links to that to [[category algebra]] and [[graded vector space]]. Instead of giving the impression of forcing this relation to my work upon these entries, I would like you to understand this as an invitation to check and, if necessary, criticize. 

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: I tried to flesh out [[tensor product]] and [[module]] a bit further, providing more details and attempting to bring the different points of view together. Check.

* [[Toby Bartels]]: I just expanded [[tensor product]], enough to include the example that links to it (without circularity).

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: I expanded on the entry [[action groupoid]] that [[Eric Forgy|Eric]] started.
