[[!include all changes]]

A list of all entries lately edited is given at

* [Recently Revised](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/recently_revised).

But since that list tends to contain lots of very minor changes and does not make it easy to spot the important new changes, in order to facilitate cooperation [[Contributors|we]] here list comments on changes we made. 

Drop a comment here if you feel people's attention should be drawn to some changes you made. For instance alert people of major additions or corrections you made.

These comments should go in _reverse_ chronological order, so that the latest are on top of the list. To keep the list international, use the date in UTC (the date given by the server for your edits).

# 2009-02-08

* [[Toby Bartels]]:
  * Somewhat incorporated [[Ronnie Brown]]\'s remark on [[geometric shapes for higher structures]].
  * Comments on [[pospace]] and [[cartesian monad]].
  * Standardized the notation as $\Simp{C}$ for the category of [[simplicial object]]s in $C$, as on [[SimpSet]], [[simplicial set]] (where I dropped an unrelated note to Tim), [[simplicial group]], etc.
  * Explained where the name of [[Galois connection]] comes from.
  * Added some details to [[cobordism]].
  * Wrote [[Practical Foundations]] about Paul Taylor\'s book and linked it from [[internal logic]] (where I also conversed with Mike).
  * I really like [[familial regularity and exactness]], which confirms all my prejudices about regularity and exactness; I have a small, largely irrelevant, question.
  * I separated [[join]] and [[meet]] from [[union]] and [[intersection]] (which are terms that I\'d use only for subobjects).

# 2009-02-07

* [[Ronnie Brown]]:
  *I edited  the discussion in [[fibration]] to give a reference to work of P.R. Heath on operations of the paths on the base on the fibres, a groupoid operation up to homotopy. 

* [[Toby Bartels]]: I\'m back! I\'ll be slowly catching up. So far, I\'ve simply read **latest changes** and extended Andrew\'s navigation links for the archive. (So it looks like the sort of thing that daily updated websites create automatically using PHP, except that I did it all laboriously by hand!)

# 2009-02-06

* [[Jocelyn Paine|Jocelyn]]: edited the [[product]] page to link to an interactive demonstration written to use the same notation as in [[product]].

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: responded to all of David's edits.

* [[David Roberts]]:
   
  * Edited [[anafunctor]] to clean up conditions on covers, and some explanations of what each one is for.

  * Created the page [[Grothendieck pretopology]]

  * Added mention of Dold fibration on the page [[fibration]].

# 2009-02-05

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]:

  * Continued discussion with Urs at [[hyperstructure]].

  * Moved [[thin]] to [[thin element]] in line with the [[HowTo|naming convention]] that page names be singular nouns.  Also added some other contexts in which "thinness" appears.

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]

  * replied to [[Mike Shulman|Mike]] at [[hyperstructure]] 

# 2009-02-04

* [[Ronnie Brown]]

  * added discussion of _strict versions of higher homotopy groupoids_ to [[fundamental infinity-groupoid]]

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]:

  * added a "laboratory section" to [[hyperstructure]] in which I am proposing a formalization of the concept

  * created [[dagger category]]; started filling [[dagger compact category]] with content

# 2009-02-03

* [[Andrew Stacey|Andrew]]

  * Implemented the archive of latest changes (scroll down to the bottom of this page to get the link)
  * Added a fair bit more on Isbell Duality in [[Froelicher space]]s.  A few more general queries for those a little more versed in the lore of categories than me.

# 2009-02-02

* [[Eric Forgy|Eric]]

  * created [[Position, Velocity, and Acceleration]] to help augment the discussion going on at the [n-Cafe](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/01/the_third_time_is_the_charm.html#c021749)

* [[Andrew Stacey|Andrew]]: continued with [[Froelicher space]]s.  In particular, laid out some of the details of the Isbell duality proof.

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]

  * added as a further example the computation of 
   $holim(\mathbf{B}H \to \mathbf{B}G \leftarrow \mathbf{B}H) \simeq H \backslash\backslash G // H$ to [[homotopy limit]]

  * many thanks to [[Mike Shulman|Mike]] and [[Timothy Porter|Tim]] for all the further details at [[homotopy limit]]! 

  * re [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]'s suggestion: yes, I'd be in favor of archiving the latest changes list here more frequently 

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]:

  * Answered Urs's question in a very long-winded way by adding lots of stuff to [[homotopy limit]].
  * What would people think about rotating (i.e. archiving) the [[latest changes]] every month, rather than every year?  It's pretty big right now and it will probably be immense by next December.

# 2009-02-01

* [[Andrew Stacey|Andrew]]: After crashing the [[HomePage|nLab]] 3 times I've finally managed to upload something on [[Froelicher space|Frolicher spaces]].  Something is seriously wrong with my syntax - if no one's taken pity on me and cleaned it up I'll do so myself tomorrow.  More importantly, I have a few queries for the more experienced categorists so I'd appreciate someone taking a look at those for me.

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: thanks, [[Mike Shulman|Mike]], very useful. Is anything similar known for 3-categories?
