[[!include all changes]]

A list of all recently edited entries can be seen here:

* [Recently Revised](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/recently_revised).

But that list tends to contain lots of minor changes: it's not easy to spot the important ones.

So, if you feel people's attention should be drawn to some changes you make, please mention them *here*.  That will help [[Contributors|us]] spot them, so we can learn what you know --- and maybe make further improvements!

These comments should go in _reverse_ chronological order, so that the latest are on top of the list. To keep the list international, use the date in UTC (the date given by the server for your edits).

# 2009-03-09

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  I finally wrote [[relation]], which makes me realise that there is no [[subset]] yet ....  Also [[order]], but that\'s just a list of links to more specific pages.

# 2009-03-08

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  I tried to clarify the difference between a [[preorder]] (a structure on a given set that satisfies certain properties) and a [[proset]] (a set equipped with such a structure).  I need to finish that for [[partial order]]/[[poset]] and [[total order]]/[[toset]], although I would also entertain the idea that these should be redirected.  But I got sidetracked writing [[linear order]] and [[loset]].  (And then there\'s [[quasiorder]]; I don\'t think that [[quoset]] is so important for reasons that I don\'t want to get into here.)

* [[John Baez]]:

  * Attempted to answer Eric's plea for a category-theoretic definition of 'Hasse diagram', in the discussino at the bottom of [[preorder]].  Unfortunately I don't know the official definition of 'Hasse diagram' --- though I know one when I see one.

  * Made a short page on [[proset]], since Toby seems to be using this as a synonym for [[preorder]].

# 2009-03-05

* [[Andrew Stacey]]:

  * Continued debate on what to call "[[generalized object|generalised object]]" since there seem to be some generalised objections (sorry).

# 2009-03-03

* [[Andrew Stacey]]:
  * Archived February
  * Started [[generalized object]]

* [[Toby Bartels]]:  Since Urs is using both 'over category' and 'over-category' (and not 'slice category'), I tried to standardise things as 'over category' to diminish the temptation to slip further into 'over-category'.  Principally this means that I moved [[slice category]] to [[over category]] and [[over-category in quasi-categories]] to [[over quasi-category]].

# 2009-03-02

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]

  * created [[limit in quasi-categories]] and in the course of saturating links from there also created [[join of simplicial sets]], [[join of categories]], [[join of quasi-categories]], [[over-category in quasi-categories]], [[terminal object in a quasi-category]] and edited [[quasi-category]] itself a bit


# 2009-03-01

[[Toby Bartels]]:
*  Slightly revised [[Tim Porter]]\'s new introduction to [[homotopy 2-type]] and copied it (with appropriate changes) to [[homotopy 1-type]] and [[homotopy 3-type]].  Also combined it with what was already at [[homotopy n-type]], so that has the most complete discussion of the issues.
*  Created a bunch of articles on specific notions of $n$-category, especially for $n \leq 3$: [[3-poset]], [[3-groupoid]], [[n-poset]], [[2-poset]], [[locally posetal 2-category]], [[2-groupoid]], [[1-category]], [[1-poset]], [[1-groupoid]], [[(-2)-groupoid]], [[(-1)-poset]].  Similarly, I moved some material from [[(-1)-groupoid]] to [[truth value]] to fit the purposes of the former page (as explained in old discussion that was also moved).
*  Spun [[simplicial groupoid]] off of [[simplicially enriched category]].  Experts please check that the definitions there (based somewhat on a remark in [[Dwyer-Kan loop groupoid]]) are correct.
