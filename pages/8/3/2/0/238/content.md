* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: recently, after [[Eric Forgy|Eric]] had requested an "arrow-theoretic" description of [[category algebra]] and of [[graded vector space]]s, I had provided a description in terms of [[bi-brane]]s and remarked that this is part of a bigger picture. That bigger picture, together with these examples, is now described over in my private area at [[schreiber:Nonabelian cocycles and their quantum symmetries]]. For completeness I have added links to that to [[category algebra]] and [[graded vector space]]. Instead of giving the impression of forcing this relation to my work upon these entries, I would like you to understand this as an invitation to check and, if necessary, criticize. 

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: I tried to flesh out [[tensor product]] and [[module]] a bit further, providing more details and attempting to bring the different points of view together. Check.

* [[Toby Bartels]]: I just expanded [[tensor product]], enough to include the example that links to it (without circularity).

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: I expanded on the entry [[action groupoid]] that [[Eric Forgy|Eric]] started.
