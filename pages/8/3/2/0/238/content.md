[[!include all changes]]

A list of all recently edited entries can be seen here:

* [Recently Revised](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/recently_revised).

But that list tends to contain lots of minor changes: it's not easy to spot the important ones.

So, if you feel people's attention should be drawn to some changes you make, please mention them *here*.  That will help [[Contributors|the rest of us]] spot them, so we can learn what you know --- and maybe make further improvements!

These comments should go in _reverse_ chronological order, so that the latest are on top of the list. To keep the list international, use the date in UTC (the date given by the server for your edits).

# 2009-05-05 #

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]:

  * replied at [[cohomology]]

# 2009-05-04 #

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]

  * worked on [[end]]: added a section "End as equalizer" where I try to motivate the formula for the end over $V$-valued functors from the equalizer formula for limits, then give the equalizer formula for ends -- personally I find this a bit more helpful than dinatural transformations, but that is certainly just my ignorance -- I added an "Idea" and a "References" and an "Examples" section 

  * added the definition to [[enriched category]] (yes, that was still "left as an exercise")

# 2009-05-03 #

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:
   *  Wrote [[FOLDS]] (and [[Michael Makkai]]), [[identity functor]], [[identity natural transformation]], [[anafunctor category]], [[identity anafunctor]], [[anabicategory]], and [[ananatural transformation]] to be linked from the below.
   *  Rewrote [[equivalence of categories]], moving one paragraph to [[Cat]] and otherwise expanding.
   *  Urs and I would like some advice from [[Tim Porter]] at [[simplicial nerve]].

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: 

  * further expanded section 2 of [[geometric infinity-function theory]], which I am to "report" on next Monday in our Journal Club. 

  * finally created [[simplicial nerve of simplicial categories]], but more details necessary...

  * am trying to find out, for [[A-infinity ring]] and [[E-infinity ring]] to which extent the two definitions "algebra over an $\infty$-operad" and "algebra object in a monoidal $(\infty,1)$-category" are equivalent, as one would expect...

  * created [[symmetric monoidal (infinity,1)-category]], [[commutative algebra in an (infinity,1)-category]], [[smash product of spectra]], [[associative ring spectrum]], [[A-infinity ring]], [[commutative ring spectrum]], [[E-infinity ring]]

  * expanded the intro at [[higher algebra]] a bit

  * thanks, [[Toby Bartels|Toby]], for your editorial help! Yes, right, "[[higher algebra]]" should be lower case, true.

# 2009-05-02 #

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:
   *  Disambiguated [[simplicial category]], hopefully correctly, at [[(infinity,1)-category]], [[derived stack]], and [[pretriangulated dg-category]].
   *  Wrote [[proper class]].
   *  Moved [[Higher Algebra]] to [[higher algebra]] because it *seemed* to be about the subject rather than about just Lurie\'s two papers, but I may have been wrong about that.
   *  Formatted theorems at [[descent for simplicial presheaves]] and [[descent]].
   *  Answered questions at [[biproduct]], [[comma category]], [[exponential object]], and [[context]].

# 2009-05-01 #

* [[Finn Lawler]]

  * Created [[lax 2-adjunction]], complete with spiffy PNGs.

  * Added some links at [[Gray-adjointness-for-2-categories]] to entries on concepts in the book.  Some of these are to non-existent pages like [[lax natural transformation]].  Do pages on 'elementary' stuff like this belong here on nLab, or should we add them to Wikipedia and link there?

   +--{: .query}
   [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: If we have a page on [[category|categories]], we can certainly have a page on lax natural transformations!

   [[Jonas Frey]]: The problem about lax natural transformations is that there is no consensus about the orientation of constraints in the literature. Johnstone in the elephant and Gurski in his PhD-thesis for example use an other orientation than Leinster and Borceux in their books.

   _Toby_:  All the more reason to write an article to explain the differences!
   =--

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]

  * created new top-level link list [[Higher Algebra]] -- to be filled with content...

  * considerably expanded [[(infinity,1)-category]] -- motivation was really to write [[relation between quasi-categories and simplicial categories]], but then ran out of steam

  * removed all existing logs here and archived them as [[2009 April changes]]
