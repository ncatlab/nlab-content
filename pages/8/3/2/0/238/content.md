[[!include all changes]]

A list of all recently edited entries can be seen here:

* [Recently Revised](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/recently_revised).

But that list tends to contain lots of minor changes: it's not easy to spot the important ones.

So, if you feel people's attention should be drawn to some changes you make, please mention them *here*.  That will help [[Contributors|the rest of us]] spot them, so we can learn what you know --- and maybe make further improvements!

These comments should go in _reverse_ chronological order, so that the latest are on top of the list. To keep the list international, use the date in UTC (the date given by the server for your edits).

# 2009-03-24

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:
   *  Gave a structural definition at [[Grothendieck universe]], but somebody should check it (Mike, this means you).
   *  Some more foundational material, including [[set theory]], [[pure set]], and [[point]] (which is a bit purple).
   *  Note that Urs also started [[stuff, structure, property]].

# 2009-03-23

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: created [[Grothendieck universe]] -- but have questions. Mentioned Grothendieck universes at [[small category]] and [[locally small category]].

# 2009-03-22

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  I added a section on morphisms between [[context]]s (the substitutions, or interpretations), including (as an example) a complete description of the category of contexts of the theory of a group.  There is an exercise (to describe that category in group-theoretic terms) whose formatting all authors might want to look at.

# 2009-03-21

* [[Tim Porter|Tim]]: 

   * I added a link to p-adic solenoid in [[shape theory]] as that example gives insights on the links between this area and dynamical systems.

# 2009-03-20

* [[Andrew Stacey]]: lifted the tangent/cotangent section from "Comparative Smootheology" to [[Froelicher space]].  I intend to remove this section from that paper and this seems like a good place to put and develop it.

* [[Zoran Škoda]]: created [[algebraic monad]], [[generalized ring]], [[compact object]], [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]], [[spectrum (geometry)]], [[Pierce spectrum]], [[filter]] (thanks Mike for an essential typographic correction), [[generator]], [[cogenerator]] (the latter were prompted by editing [[Morita equivalence]], paragraph on classical Morita). Zoran and Toby distributed the paragraph on ultrafilters from long growing entry [[filter]] partly to the new entry [[ultrafilter]]. Uploaded [[warsaw.gif:file]] with link within [[shape theory]].

# 2009-03-19

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]

  * followed [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]'s remark and moved the previous content in [[stable infinity-category]] to [[stable (infinity,1)-category]], keeping just a general nonsense statement at [[stable infinity-category]]

  * added a remark on this and a link at [[spectrum]]


* [[Zoran Škoda]]: moved the earlier material from entry algebra to new entry [[associative unital algebra]], and put new material into [[algebra]]; one should have separate entry for any framework for algebras, and general entry [[algebra]] should have pointers to the major classes (like [[algebra over operad]]). Thanks Toby, we continue together on that: now there is an entry [[nonassociative algebra]] and so on. I have also addressed concerns of Mike in [[Connes' cyclic category]] which now has I hope correct definitions, plus more foundational issues and relevant literature and link to just uploaded file  [[krasauskas.pdf:file]]

* [[Andrew Stacey|Andrew]]: Added some more to [[Froelicher space]].  I've started on a new project on this: adapting topological notions to Froelicher spaces.

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: 
  
  * created [[stable infinity-category]]

  * implemented [[Zoran Skoda|Zoran]]'s remark below by rephrasing a bit at [[Categories and Sheaves]]

  * added a bit more to [[large category]]

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  Let [[specialization topology]] lead me to [[specialization order]].

* [[David Roberts]]:

  * Created [[Grothendieck's Galois theory]]

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]:

  * Removed the discussion about accented characters from   [[fundamental group of a topos]] and put it in the [[FAQ]].

  * Displayed my happiness at [[quotient object]] by removing the discussion.

# 2009-03-18

* [[Zoran Škoda]] has created [[dense subcategory]] (intentionally organized different than the entry for the entry for slight generalization, [[dense functor]]); created [[shape theory]] but needs much more work; I copied here references from [[fundamental group of a topos]] (plus to a Batanin's article) and in [[fundamental group of a topos]] I added the reference and link to Pataraia's article important for the abstract notion of fundamental groupoid in internal contexts. 

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: 

  * created an entry on the book [[Categories and Sheaves]] (comment you say that "sheaf condition is localization" there; well the category of sheaves is a localization of the category of presheaves, but the sheaf condition...you really meant what you say? -- Zoran)

  * in reaction to [[Toby Bartels|Toby]]'s discussion at [[large category]] I created entries for [[accessible category]], [[locally presentable category]] and [[sketch]]. But very incomplete.

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  Started a discussion about [[large category]].

* [[Andrew Stacey|Andrew]]:

  * More done on [[Froelicher space]]s.  I think that I have finally figured out the relationship between Fr&#246;licher spaces and Isbell duality so if anyone else is interested in taking a look I'd appreciate your comments.

    I also found the standard layout of the page a little hard to work with, in particular with regard to delimiting proofs and definitions (both of which could get quite long) so I've been experimenting with alternative ways of demarking them (on [[Froelicher space]]).  Let me know if you like or dislike what you see.

* [[David Corfield|David]]:

  * Added a reference in response to one of Mike's questions at [[fundamental group of a topos]].

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]:

  * Created [[quantale]], [[adjoint functor theorem]], and [[total category]].
  * Asked some questions at [[fundamental group of a topos]].

* [[Tim Porter|Tim]]: 

   * Created [[fundamental group of a topos]].  At present this is lifted / adapted from an article I wrote some time ago so needs some attention.  (This necessary attention includes fixing some diacriticals on some names.)

# 2009-03-17

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]:

  * Yes, homotopy theorists call a [[k-tuply groupal n-groupoid]] a _grouplike $E_k$-space_.

  * Continued discussion at [[Crans-Gray tensor product]].

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:
   *  Wrote [[congruence]] to mean an internal equivalence relation.
   *  Wrote [[k-tuply groupal n-groupoid]] based on [[k-tuply monoidal n-category]].  But I strongly suspect that homotopy theorists have something to say here in a completely different language.  (Perhaps [[Mike Shulman]] knows.)
   *  Created [[wedge sum]] to link from the following, and [[smash product]] to go with it.
   *  Put in a general definition at [[homotopy group]], trying to show how $\pi_n$ has $n$ products that are all the same.

* [[Tim Porter|Tim]]: I have been trying to give an adequate categorical treatment of [[profinite completion of a group]].

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: 

  * made a little remark on [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]'s question at [[Crans-Gray tensor product]] and ask another question myself

  * added a remark to [[Waldhausen category]] on its relation to [[category of fibrant objects]] and ask a [question](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/01/nlab_general_discussion.html#c022572) about the precise statement to be made here over at the $n$Caf&#233;

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  Combined [[proset]] into [[preorder]], etc, as planned there.

* [[Andrew Stacey|Andrew]]:

  * Shifted [[generalized object|generalised object]] to [[Isbell envelope]] in line with the comments from the categories mailing list.  Mainly just altered the terminology in line with this nomenclature, but added a small section on how it relates to profunctors as well.
  * Modified [[Froelicher space]] a little as well in line with the Isbell envelope nomenclature.

* [[Zoran Škoda]] created [[Waldhausen category]] and made a remark into entry [[cofibration category]]. 

* [[Toby Bartels]]:  I created [[symmetric set]] out of material that [[Zoran Škoda]] added to [[FinSet]].

# 2009-03-16

* [[Toby Bartels]]:  Tired of writing `[[constructivism|constructive mathematics]]`, I moved [[constructivism]] to [[constructive mathematics]] and fixed links.  Similarly, I moved [[predicativism]] to [[predicative mathematics]].  After some thought, I also moved [[finitism]] to [[finite mathematics]] and expanded it a bit to fit the new name better.  To go with this, I finally created [[FinSet]].

* [[Zoran Škoda|Zoran]]: Created [[Loday-Pirashvili category]], [[dense functor]] and [[equivariant object]]. There are two different notions of dense subcategory, first of which has two different definitions and is related to colimits and nerve functor, and second which is related to pro-objects. In the entry [[Bousfield localization]] I added a paragraph on Bousfield localization for triangulated categories; made changes to [[nerve]] (more to be done: one needs to clarify the example of geometric realization etc.). 

* [[Tim Porter|Tim]]: 
  * I have put a request on [[Loday-Pirashvili category]] for some discussion of the links between the ideas here and those in [[2-vector space]], as there is overlap.
  * I have started a discussion on the exposition of [[dg-algebra]]. My preferred approach is via graded object,  differential algebra and  chain complex. The present approach I find a bit confusing.
  * In [[profinite completion of a group]], I have pointed out a difference in the use of the term [[profinite group]], that may need discussion.

# 2009-03-15

* [[Zoran Škoda|Zoran]]: Created (in last two days) several entries mainly related to co- Hopf- algebras and algebras in categories of chain complexes: [[Frechet-Uryson space]], [[Hopf module]], [[Hopf-Galois extension]], [[Maurer-Cartan equation]], [[category of elements]], [[compactly generated space]], [[coring]], [[dg-algebra]],[[distributive law]], [[torsor]] (very unfinished!), [[twisted module of homomorphisms]], [[twisted tensor product]], [[twisting cochain]] and made changes to few other entries including many changes in entry [[Hopf algebra]] and some in [[A-infinity-algebra]]. With the (Fukaya) convention used there $D_0$ should not exist.

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: Created [[homotopy equivalence]] and [[weak homotopy equivalence]].

* [[Tim Porter|Tim]]: 

  * created [[I-category]] which includes an alternative axiomatisation of [[cylinder functor]].  This is needed for Baues' version of abstract homotopy theory. Some results and examples will need to be added later.


# 2009-03-14

* [[Bruce Bartlett]] has created [[nInsights]].

* [[Ronnie Brown]]: I've rewritten and expanded [[homotopy group]]s partly to clarify the operation of dimension 1 on higher dimensions  and to emphasise the groupoid aspects. 

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  I\'ve written [[sequence]], [[net]], [[multi-valued function]], [[partial function]], and the long-delayed [[surjection]] and [[injection]].  Those interested in foundations may be particularly interested in my proposed alternative definition of [[sequence]].

*  [[Tim Porter|Tim]]: I have included a discussion of the nerve of an [[internal category]] at that entry.

# 2009-03-13

*  [[Tim Porter|Tim]]: I have changed the initial sentence of [[homotopy n-type]].  I think this is converging well thanks to the efforts of Mike and Toby. 

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  Since we already have [[fundamental groupoid]] and even [[fundamental infinity-groupoid]], I started [[fundamental group]] and [[homotopy group]].  But I only wrote #Idea# sections.

# 2009-03-12

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]:

  * Responded at [[homotopy n-type]] and [[proset]].

  * Did a little more bettering of [[profinite group]], and was inspired to create [[filtered category]], [[pro-object]], [[ind-object]], and (as stubs) [[free completion]] and [[topological group]].

*  [[Tim Porter|Tim]]:
    * I have edited [[homotopy type]] as recent changes seem to have altered the idea away from the usual one making it perhaps too narrow.  A similar problem seems to occur with [[homotopy n-type]] and I have raised a terminological query there as well.
   * In [[homotopy n-type]] I have also queried the use of 'nice space' and its relation with [[nice topological space]].  This latter entry is perhaps misnamed as it is really the category of these spaces that is nice rather than the spaces themselves.
   *  I have raised a question on *Disambiguation* at [[proset]].  Have we a policy as to how to handle  terms with perfectly acceptable multiple meanings?
   *  I have tried to 'better' the previous entry on [[profinite group]]! (see the old version to see why I say it this way.)

* [[Mike Shulman]]: A question about the [[Crans-Gray tensor product]].

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:
   *  Broke [[undirected object]] off of [[directed object]] as planned.  Discussion stayed at [[directed object]], even though it discusses both concepts (and that of a [[directed space]]).
   *  Finally wrote [[full subcategory]] and directed links to it.
   *  I\'ve continued the conversation that [[Eric Forgy]] started at [[preorder]].
   *  I have my own terminological question at [[linear relation]].

# 2009-03-11

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: I have a suggestion for a terminological change at [[k-tuply monoidal n-category]].

# 2009-03-10


* [[Tim Porter]]:  

  * Eventually we probably need a summary of some of the theory of algebraic homotopy that Baues has developed as if impinges on the [[homotopy hypothesis]] and on [[homotopical cohomology theory]].  To this end I have created a sort of historical entry on [[algebraic homotopy]].  

  *  Created [[cofibration category]] as the first of the 'Bauesian' detailed entries.


* [[Toby Bartels]]:  I\'ve written several more articles on very basic topics, such as those that used to be '?'-links below.  You can see them on Recently Revised; I don\'t think that anything merits great attention.

# 2009-03-09

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  I finally wrote [[relation]], which makes me realise that there is no [[subset]] yet ....  Also [[order]], but that\'s just a list of links to more specific pages.

# 2009-03-08

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  I tried to clarify the difference between a [[preorder]] (a structure on a given set that satisfies certain properties) and a [[proset]] (a set equipped with such a structure).  I need to finish that for [[partial order]]/[[poset]] and [[total order]]/[[toset]], although I would also entertain the idea that these should all be redirected one way or the other.  But I got sidetracked writing [[linear order]] and [[loset]] instead.  (And then there\'s [[quasiorder]]; I don\'t think that [[quoset]] is necessary for reasons that I don\'t want to get into here.)

* [[John Baez]]:

  * Attempted to answer Eric's plea for a category-theoretic definition of 'Hasse diagram', in the discussion at the bottom of [[preorder]].  Unfortunately I don't know the official definition of 'Hasse diagram' --- though I know one when I see one.

  * Made a short page on [[proset]], since Toby seems to be using this as a synonym for [[preorder]].

# 2009-03-05

* [[Andrew Stacey]]:

  * Continued debate on what to call "[[generalized object|generalised object]]" since there seem to be some generalised objections (sorry).

# 2009-03-03

* [[Andrew Stacey]]:
  * Archived February
  * Started [[generalized object]]

* [[Toby Bartels]]:  Since Urs is using both 'over category' and 'over-category' (and not 'slice category'), I tried to standardise things as 'over category' to diminish the temptation to slip further into 'over-category'.  Principally this means that I moved [[slice category]] to [[over category]] and [[over-category in quasi-categories]] to [[over quasi-category]].

# 2009-03-02

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]

  * created [[limit in quasi-categories]] and in the course of saturating links from there also created [[join of simplicial sets]], [[join of categories]], [[join of quasi-categories]], [[over-category in quasi-categories]], [[terminal object in a quasi-category]] and edited [[quasi-category]] itself a bit

# 2009-03-01

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:
   *  Slightly revised [[Tim Porter]]\'s new introduction to [[homotopy 2-type]] and copied it (with appropriate changes) to [[homotopy 1-type]] and [[homotopy 3-type]].  Also combined it with what was already at [[homotopy n-type]], so that has the most complete discussion of the issues.
   *  Created a bunch of articles on specific notions of $n$-category, especially for $n \leq 3$: [[3-poset]], [[3-groupoid]], [[n-poset]], [[2-poset]], [[locally posetal 2-category]], [[2-groupoid]], [[1-category]], [[1-poset]], [[1-groupoid]], [[(-2)-groupoid]], [[(-1)-poset]].  Similarly, I moved some material from [[(-1)-groupoid]] to [[truth value]] to fit the purposes of the former page (as explained in old discussion that was also moved).
   *  Spun [[simplicial groupoid]] off of [[simplicially enriched category]].  Experts please check that the definitions there (based somewhat on a remark in [[Dwyer-Kan loop groupoid]]) are correct.
