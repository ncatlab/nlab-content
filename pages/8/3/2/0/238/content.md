[[!include all changes]]

A list of all entries lately edited is given at

* [Recently Revised](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/recently_revised).

But since that list tends to contain lots of very minor changes and does not make it easy to spot the important new changes, in order to facilitate cooperation [[Contributors|we]] here list comments on changes we made. 

Drop a comment here if you feel people's attention should be drawn to some changes you made. For instance alert people of major additions or corrections you made.

These comments should go in _reverse_ chronological order, so that the latest are on top of the list. To keep the list international, use the date in UTC (the date given by the server for your edits).

# 2009-02-26

* [[Andrew Stacey|Andrew]]

  * Created a [[request for help]] page.  There are query boxes scattered all over the lab and I think that it ought to be a priority to answer these.  A query on a page might be answerable by someone not an expert in what's on that page (or even not interested in what's on that page) - in fact, that's highly likely.  Flagging questions on this page (i.e., Latest Changes) is also less than optimal as it's not clear who might be able to answer them (and probably not everyone checks this page).    I freely admit that I'm doing this because no-one seems bothered in my questions on [[Froelicher space]]s which are, in fact, more general category theory than specifics to Fr&#246;licher spaces.

    I've added it to the sidebar (and taken off [[General Discussion]]).

# 2009-02-25

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]

  * created [[enriched functor category]] for completeness

  * added a bit more details and references concerning the SSet homotopy limit at [[weighted limit]]

  * after checking with [[Mike Shulman|Mike]] added details of the definition of homotopy limits in terms of weighted limits in the [[SSet]]-enriched context to [[weighted limit]]; also edited accordingly the section _local definition_ at [[homotopy limit]] and created a section on weighted limits at [[representable functor]]

# 2009-02-24

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]

  * have a question at the end of [[weighted limit]] for the homotopy coherency experts

  * created [[weighted limit]]

  * added references to [[sheaf]] and [[simplicial set]]


# 2009-02-23

* [[Tim Porter|Tim]]: 

  *  Created an entry on the Conduch&#233; decomposition of the group of $n$-simplices of a simplicial group: [[decomposition theorem for simplicial groups]]. (An idea for renaming this entry would be welcome!)
  *  Edited [[group T-complex]].

# 2009-02-19

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: created [[n-fibration]].

+--{.query}

Why do I think of the Beach Boys every time I read the word $n$-fibrations? - Eric

=--

* [[Ronnie Brown|Ronnie]]: over the last two days, created [[compositions in cubical sets]] which gives the basic definitions and axioms for cubical sets with compositions and  connections, (and inverses), with the example of the cubical singular complex in mind. 

# 2009-02-18

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]:

  * Created [[Euler characteristic]] in order to ask a question there.

# 2009-02-17

* [[Toby Bartels]]:
  *  Separated [[equivalence of categories]] from [[equivalence]].
  *  Basically copied [[2-category]] to [[3-category]], then added a bit to the end of each to make the difference nontrivial.  Also created [[strict 3-category]] along similar lines, although it\'s still rather short.

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]:

  * Introduced the terminology _strict [[homotopy limit]]_ by analogy with [[strict 2-limit]].

  * Rearranged [[homotopy pullback]] to make it fit better with [[homotopy limit]].

# 2009-02-16

* [[Toby Bartels]]:
  * Fixed links to [[equivalence]] that should really be to [[weak equivalence]].
  * Separated [[Segal space]] from [[complete Segal space]].

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: asked a question about [[horizontal categorification]].

# 2009-02-15

* [[Tim Porter|Tim]]: Added the construction of $\overline{W}$, the classifying space construction for simplicial groups to the entry for [[simplicial group]].

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]

  * created [[topological T-duality]]

  * created [[homotopy pullback]]

  * created [[weak equivalence]]

  * replied at [[dg-category]]


# 2009-02-14

* [[Ronnie Brown|Ronnie]] Added entries on C. [[Ehresmann]] and on [[Grothendieck]]. The second probably should be expanded, but it has a link to a good account. 

* [[Tim Porter|Tim]]: Asked a question in [[dg-category]] as to the degree of the differentials. We may need a convention on this.

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]

  * added To&#235;n-Vezzosi proposal $2Vect := Ch(Vect)-Mod$ to [[2-vector space]] and created [[dg-category]] accompanying this


# 2009-02-13

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]:

  * Incorporated the reference Tim suggested at [[homotopy limit]].

  * Replied at [[strict 2-limit]] and [[comma category]].

* [[Tim Porter|Tim]]: 

  *  Added something to [[homotopy limit]] in part to provide a possible 'old' reference in reply to Urs and Mike below.
  *  Started adding some summaries of results to [[group T-complex]].

* [[Toby Bartels]]:
  * Imposed the convention for a group $G$, that $\mathcal{B}G$ is a space while $\mathbf{B}G$ is a groupoid, on [[classifying space]] and [[homotopy 1-type]] (although the groupoid has disappeared from that one), to hopefully reduce confusion.
  * Linked [[FAQ]] and [[HowTo]] from one another.
  * Terminological notes at [[strict 2-limit]] and [[comma category]].

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: Urs, in my biased opinion, the reference for the [[homotopy limit]] comparison that I find easiest to understand is my own paper (reference added).  Of course the fact has been known for a long time; I don't even know whether there's any "original" source one could cite.

# 2009-02-12

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: at [[homotopy limit]] I am asking for further details and/or literature on the "central theorem" which identified local and global definition

* [[Mike Shulman]]:

  * Added what I think is a more standard viewpoint to [[classifying space]], although there are so many different meanings of that term.

  * Created [[comma object]] and started messing around with using SVG for diagrams instead of `\array`.  It's more work but it sure does look nicer (in the output, anyway).

+-- {: .query}
[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: looks good! We should have at  [[FAQ]] a brief instruction for how to proceed to produce such diagrams (which software to download, how to get nicely typeset labels, etc.) 

Mike: I gave it a [[FAQ|try]], but I don't have any great wisdom to impart; I just played around with the XML until it worked.  If there is software that can do this for us that would be great (until someone manages to write an xypic-to-svg converter).

# 2009-02-11

* [[Toby Bartels]]:
  * Agreed with Mike at [[large site]].
  * Replied to Andrew at [[Toby Bartels]].

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]

  * I like the edits at [[2-limit]] and [[strict 2-limit]], so I removed the comments (but anyone else with opinions, feel free to restart the discussion).

  * Naming question for [[large sheaf]].

  * Answered at [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]]

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]

  * have a question for [[Mike Shulman|Mike]] at [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]]

  * created [[Bousfield localization]]

* [[Toby Bartels]]:
  * Comments (with related edits) at [[2-limit]] and [[strict 2-limit]].
  * Expanded [[section]] and wrote [[retraction]] following it; similarly wrote [[split monomorphism]] following [[split epimorphism]].
  * Separated [[k-tuply monoidal (n,r)-category]] from [[periodic table]].
  * Linked to [[Pursuing Stacks]] from [[infinity-stack]] so it won\'t be an orphan.  People more familiar with _Pursuing Stacks_ than I am may want to link to it in other ways.

# 2009-02-10

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]

  * created [[sheaves on large sites]] mainly to ask the question which I ask there

  * created [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]], [[model structure on simplicial sheaves]] 

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]:

  * Wrote about effective-epimorphic sieves at [[subcanonical coverage]], by way of answering questions about [[anafunctor]]s.
  * Wrote [[comma category]].  We should probably be consistent between [[under category]]/[[coslice category]] and [[slice category]]/[[over category]] about which is the page and which is the redirect.  I'm pulling for slice and coslice myself.

* [[Andrew Stacey|Andrew]]
  * Started the [[FAQ]].  (The link on [[HomePage]] could possibly be removed - I put it there to start the [[FAQ]] but then also put a link in the sidebar.)
  * Okay, only a minor point: I corrected the syntax of the query block on the [[HowTo]] page.  The syntax that was there works, but is not the "standard" syntax as defined by the [maruku filter](http://maruku.rubyforge.org/proposal.html).

* [[Toby Bartels]]
  * Finally contributed to the discussion at [[anafunctor]].
  * Asked a question at [[subcanonical coverage]].
  * Wrote [[finite group]], since they\'re mentioned on [[profinite group]].
  * Clarified [[essentially algebraic theory]] a bit.

* [[David Roberts]]
  * Continued discussion with Mike at [[anafunctor]], and moved the discussion to its own section. I disagreed about the use of ''regular epimorphism'' for covers in categories without all pullbacks.
  * Discussion at [[generalized smooth space]], and created (a very sketchy!) page [[profinite group]].

* [[Toby Bartels]]:
  * Fixed the theorem environments at [[cat-1-group]] (you need six hash marks).
  * Defined $(n,r)$-fold categories at [[n-fold category]], just because I could.

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]

  * created [[Courant Lie algebroid]]

  * reacted to [[Toby Bartels|Toby]]'s remark at [[n-fold category]] by incorporating it and removing the query box

# 2009-02-09

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]:
  * Replied at [[internal logic]].
  * Merged the discussion at [[directed set]] into the entry and removed the discussion.  Writing [[locally presentable category]] and [[accessible category]] is on my to-do list, if no one beats me to it.
  * Raised an objection at [[entire relation]].

* [[Toby Bartels]]:
  * Removed the discussion at [[internal logic]] and [[entire relation]] (which I thought I\'d already corrected!), since Mike is right and I\'m satisfied.
  * Wrote [[entire relation]] and [[functional relation]] (but not yet [[relation]]!).
  * Asked a question about $n$-fold groupoids at [[n-fold category]].

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]

  * fixed the mistake at [[interval object]] that [[Toby Bartels|Toby]] spotted and added a little bit of dicussion

  * added Berger-Moerdijk's definition to [[interval object]]

* [[Toby Bartels]]:
  * Made an objection at [[interval object]].
  * Talked to Mike at [[directed set]], [[weak limit]], and [[internal logic]].

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]:

  * Replied to Toby at [[directed set]], [[internal logic]], and [[familial regularity and exactness]].

  * Created [[weak limit]].

# 2009-02-08

* [[Toby Bartels]]: Did some work on [[directed object]], which I think should have half spun off to [[undirected object]].

* [[Tim Porter|Tim]]:

  *  Created an entry on [[Dwyer-Kan loop groupoid]].
   
* [[Toby Bartels]]:
  * A comment at [[directed space]], which led me to write [[directed set]] just to clarify terminology.
  * Somewhat incorporated [[Ronnie Brown]]\'s remark on [[geometric shapes for higher structures]].
  * Comments on [[pospace]] and [[cartesian monad]].
  * Standardized the notation as $\Simp{C}$ for the category of [[simplicial object]]s in $C$, as on [[SimpSet]], [[simplicial set]] (where I dropped an unrelated note to Tim), [[simplicial group]], etc.
  * Explained where the name of [[Galois connection]] comes from.
  * Added some details to [[cobordism]].
  * Wrote [[Practical Foundations]] about Paul Taylor\'s book and linked it from [[internal logic]] (where I also conversed with Mike).
  * I really like [[familial regularity and exactness]], which confirms all my prejudices about regularity and exactness; I have a small, largely irrelevant, question.
  * I separated [[join]] and [[meet]] from [[union]] and [[intersection]] (which are terms that I\'d use only for subobjects).

# 2009-02-07

* [[Ronnie Brown]]:
  *I edited  the discussion in [[fibration]] to give a reference to work of P.R. Heath on operations of the paths on the base on the fibres, a groupoid operation up to homotopy. 

* [[Toby Bartels]]: I\'m back! I\'ll be slowly catching up. So far, I\'ve simply read **latest changes** and extended Andrew\'s navigation links for the archive. (So it looks like the sort of thing that daily updated websites create automatically using PHP, except that I did it all laboriously by hand!)

# 2009-02-06

* [[Jocelyn Paine|Jocelyn]]: edited the [[product]] page to link to an interactive demonstration written to use the same notation as in [[product]].

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: responded to all of David's edits.

* [[David Roberts]]:
   
  * Edited [[anafunctor]] to clean up conditions on covers, and some explanations of what each one is for.

  * Created the page [[Grothendieck pretopology]]

  * Added mention of Dold fibration on the page [[fibration]].

# 2009-02-05

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]:

  * Continued discussion with Urs at [[hyperstructure]].

  * Moved [[thin]] to [[thin element]] in line with the [[HowTo|naming convention]] that page names be singular nouns.  Also added some other contexts in which "thinness" appears.

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]

  * replied to [[Mike Shulman|Mike]] at [[hyperstructure]] 

# 2009-02-04

* [[Ronnie Brown]]

  * added discussion of _strict versions of higher homotopy groupoids_ to [[fundamental infinity-groupoid]]

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]:

  * added a "laboratory section" to [[hyperstructure]] in which I am proposing a formalization of the concept

  * created [[dagger category]]; started filling [[dagger compact category]] with content

# 2009-02-03

* [[Andrew Stacey|Andrew]]

  * Implemented the archive of latest changes (scroll down to the bottom of this page to get the link)
  * Added a fair bit more on Isbell Duality in [[Froelicher space]]s.  A few more general queries for those a little more versed in the lore of categories than me.

# 2009-02-02

* [[Eric Forgy|Eric]]

  * created [[Position, Velocity, and Acceleration]] to help augment the discussion going on at the [n-Cafe](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/01/the_third_time_is_the_charm.html#c021749)

* [[Andrew Stacey|Andrew]]: continued with [[Froelicher space]]s.  In particular, laid out some of the details of the Isbell duality proof.

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]

  * added as a further example the computation of 
   $holim(\mathbf{B}H \to \mathbf{B}G \leftarrow \mathbf{B}H) \simeq H \backslash\backslash G // H$ to [[homotopy limit]]

  * many thanks to [[Mike Shulman|Mike]] and [[Timothy Porter|Tim]] for all the further details at [[homotopy limit]]! 

  * re [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]'s suggestion: yes, I'd be in favor of archiving the latest changes list here more frequently 

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]:

  * Answered Urs's question in a very long-winded way by adding lots of stuff to [[homotopy limit]].
  * What would people think about rotating (i.e. archiving) the [[latest changes]] every month, rather than every year?  It's pretty big right now and it will probably be immense by next December.

# 2009-02-01

* [[Andrew Stacey|Andrew]]: After crashing the [[HomePage|nLab]] 3 times I've finally managed to upload something on [[Froelicher space|Frolicher spaces]].  Something is seriously wrong with my syntax - if no one's taken pity on me and cleaned it up I'll do so myself tomorrow.  More importantly, I have a few queries for the more experienced categorists so I'd appreciate someone taking a look at those for me.

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: thanks, [[Mike Shulman|Mike]], very useful. Is anything similar known for 3-categories?
