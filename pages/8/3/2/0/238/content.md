A list of all entries lately edited is given at

* [Recently Revised](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/recently_revised).

But since that list tends to contain lots of very minor changes and does not make it easy to spot the important new changes, in order to facilitate cooperation [[Contributors|we]] here list comments on changes we made. 

Drop a comment here if you feel people's attention should be drawn to some changes you made. For instance alert people of major additions or corrections you made.

These comments should go in _reverse_ chronological order, so that the latest are on top of the list.

# 2009-01-06


* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]

  * further expanded on a bit and harmonized a bit more the circle of entries [[globe category]], [[simplex category]], [[cube category]] and [[globe]], [[simplex]], [[cube]] linked to and summarized in   [[geometric shapes for higher structures]]. At [[globe]] I give a reply to a question by Eric on how to think of globes as "pointed spheres" by stating a claim that the $(n+1)$-globe is the double cone over the $n$-globe in a precise sense. I believe this is true, but am not entirely happy with the proof I have. Would be great if somebody could check this.

# 2009-01-05

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]

  * Created [[power]] and [[copower]].  Possibly these should be just one page? 
+--{.query}
 I think it is good to have many separate entries for sub-concepts if they all link to each other, maybe with a brief comment. --[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]
=--


* [[Toby Bartels]]: I reacted to everything that everybody did this year, and I interacted with everything that everybody did today. More specifically:
  * I created [[parallel morphisms]], although perhaps I should have called it [[parallel pair]].
  * I added material, some possible irrelevant, to [[global element]].
  * I fixed typos in the stuff that I posted this year and copied some relevant bits to other pages, like [[2-category]].
  * I added some false material to [[extensive category]].
  * I added my opinion to [[Grothendieck topology]] and [[subcategory]].
  * I followed Mike\'s changes to [[simplicial category]] and applied them to [[cubical category]], creating [[cube category]] and (for good measure) [[globe category]].
  * I disambiguated links to [[simplicial category]], [[omega-category]], and [[internalization]].
  * I gave my favourite example of the [[red herring principle]].
  * I probably did some other stuff too, which I can no longer recall.

* [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]

  * Split off [[internal category]] from [[internalization]].  Probably a lot of links need to be updated.

  * Summarized the discussion at [[subcategory]] into a section called "Non-evil variants."

  * Created the entry [[red herring principle]].

* [[Todd Trimble|Todd]] 
  
  * created the entry [[CW complex]]

  * added an alternative definition of [[cube category]], linking it to $\Delta$ and string diagrams

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]

  * am reading [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]'s [Homotopy limits and colimits and enriched category theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.AT/0610194v1) and started adding some central definitions as entries here, such as [[closed monoidal homotopical category]] and [[enriched homotopical category]] and some related entries such as [[homotopical category]] and [[homotopy coherent category theory]]. Eventually I would like to see if some of my favorite monoidal homotopical categories are _examples_. See my request [here](closed monoidal homotopical category).

  * added [[Crans-Gray tensor product]]

  * started replying to [[Todd Trimble|Todd]]'s remarks at [[stack]] by addding a section _Descent in terms of pseudo-functors_ to [[descent and codescent]].

  * following the discussion which I now moved to [[discussion on terminology -- omega-category]] I moved the original material on that to [[strict omega-category]] and kept at [[omega-category]] just a pointer to that entry. This means we should go through a bunch of entries and rename links to [[omega-category]] into links to [[strict omega-category]].

* [[David Corfield]] 

  * created [[philosophy]], [[Klein 2-geometry]]

* [[Emily Riehl]] 

  * created [[model structure on simplicial sets]]

* [[Mike Shulman]]:

  * Added [[nice topological space]].

# 2009-01-04

* [[Mike Shulman]]:

  * Added disambiguation comments to [[simplicial category]].

  * Created [[Gray tensor product]] and [[Gray-category]].

* [[Toby Bartels]]:
  * I posted [[k-tuply monoidal n-category]]. I\'ll correct typos and look at everything else tonight (when it\'s technically -05).
  * Urs is right about $\infty$ vs $\omega$, and I\'ve changed the other appearances in [[(n,r)-category]] and [[periodic table]] (as well as fixing the new one!).

* [[Mike Shulman]]:

  * Added a terminological suggestion to [[omega-category]].

  * Refactored [[tensor product]], removing the discussion which prompted the refactoring.  Created [[fc-multicategory]].

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]:
 
   * meant to follow up on [[Todd Trimble|Todd]]'s discussion of [[sheaf]] and [[stack]] in terms of [[sieve]]s and relate it to the entry on [[descent and codescent]] and  [[infinity-stack]] but was distracted by other things. But I did write up a quick rough note on this into a LaTeX file, which you can see here for the time being: [[if.pdf:file]].

   * expanded on the [[sheaf]]-condition, offering in parallel to the definition in terms of [[sieve]]s the definition in terms of [[oriental]]s with a a few remarks on how both are related and what the issue is with generalizing to  [[stack]] and [[infinity-stack]].

   * added, following email discussion with [[Todd Trimble|Todd]], a discussion to [[sieve]] of which sieves are the presheaf incarnations of which [[cover|covers]], and why

   * adapted [[n-category]] and [[n-groupoid]] to [[Toby Bartels|Toby]]'s [[(n,r)-category]] (which is a great entry -- we should flesh that out further).

   * took the liberty of changing in [[Toby Bartels|Toby]]'s entry [[(n,r)-category]] the "$\omega$-categories" appearing there to "$\infty$-categories", since I thought we did agree that "$\infty$-category" is the generic term while [[omega-category]] specifically means _strict globular $\infty$-category_.

   * separated [[infinity-category]] from [[higher category theory]] and added some brief stub entries such as [[n-category]], [[n-groupoid]] and [[Kan complex]]. 

   * created a _blog_ entry [nLab -- General Discussion](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/01/nlab_general_discussion.html) and added a remark at the beginning of the original _wiki_ entry [[General Discussion]] asking to post further general discussion not to the wiki, but to the blog.

   * rearranged [[tensor product]] following the comments and corrections by [[Toby Bartels|Toby]] and [[Mike Shulman|Mike]] (thanks!).

# 2009-01-03

* [[Mike Shulman]]:

  * there is a discussion going on at [[subcategory]] over whether any faithful functor should be called a "subcategory."  Input welcomed.

  * added a comment on terminological objections to [[Grothendieck topology]].

  * corrected the example of abelian groups at [[tensor product]].

  * added examples and comment on non-monoidal closure to [[closed category]]

* [[Todd Trimble]]: 

  * added to (and edited) examples under [[closed category]]
  
  * created [[dinatural transformation]]

  * added examples to [[extensive category]]

  * added to the discussion on [[Day convolution]]
 
  * added some detail to the definition of [[Lawvere-Tierney topology]]

* [[Urs Schreiber]]: 
 
  * did [[closed category]] and linked to it from Mike's [[cartesian monoidal category]]

  * expanded on [[Day convolution]]

  * split the information previously contained in [[site]] into several separate entries: [[cover]], [[sieve]], [[Grothendieck topology]], [[Lawvere-Tierney topology]] and, of course, [[site]].

* [[Mike Shulman]] created [[extensive category]], [[cartesian monoidal category]]

* [[Todd Trimble]] expanded on [[stack]]
and connected it to the discussion of covering sieves at
[[site]] 

* [[Toby Bartels]]: I posted [[periodic table]] and [[(n,r)-category]], which I wrote today offline. There are probably lots of typos right now; I don\'t have a lot of time online today. Also, the former one really only contains an appendix that I wanted to write, not so much the article itself. But at least you can read what\'s there now.

# 2009-01-02

* [[Todd Trimble]] created [[operad]] 

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: started adding remarks to [[opposite category]] about the big story hidden here related to [[duality]].

* [[Todd Trimble]] has expanded on [[site]] and [[sheaf]]. I have started adding a bit more motivational detail to [[site]] and links to [[descent and codescent|descent]], [[stack]] and [[infinity-stack]]. There is still plenty of room here for saying more about this general story.

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: motivated by some [discussion](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/12/organizing_the_pages_at_nlab.html) we had on the blog, in the entry [[About]] I started giving some indications on what the $n$Lab is and what it is not. 

* [[Owen Biesel]]: added [[diagram]], [[global element]], [[terminal object]], [[limit]], 

# 2009-01-01

Apparently, we all took a break from the $n$Lab for the New Year!
