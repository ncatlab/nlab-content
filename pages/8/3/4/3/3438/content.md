## Idea

**Mostowski's collapsing lemma** states that any [[extensional relation|extensional]] [[well-founded relation]] is isomorphic to a (necessarily unique) [[transitive set]].

Mostowski's lemma can be proven in [[ZF]] set theory using the [[axiom of replacement]] and [[axiom of separation]].  In set theories that are not powerful enough to prove the lemma, it can be adopted as a separate axiom; in this case it is sometimes called **Mostowski's principle**.

Mostowski's principle is sort of a "dual" of the [[axiom of foundation]] that the membership relation is well-founded (and, by the [[axiom of extensionality]], extensional).  A related principle for [[structural set theory]] is the [[axiom of well-founded materialization]].
