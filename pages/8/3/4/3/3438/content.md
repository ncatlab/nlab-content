**Mostowski's collapsing lemma** states that any [[extensional relation|extensional]] [[well-founded relation]] is isomorphic to a (necessarily unique) [[transitive set]].

Mostowski's lemma can be proven in [[ZF]] set theory using the [[axiom of replacement]] and [[axiom of separation]].  In set theories that are not powerful enough to prove the lemma, it can be adopted as a separate axiom; in this case it is sometimes called **Mostowski's principle**.
