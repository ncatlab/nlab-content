## Idea

Given a ring $R$ (or some analogue, say a Banach algebra), 
a submodule $K$ of an $R$-module $M$ is called
__superfluous__ or small in $M$, written $K \ll M$, 
if, for every submodule $L\subset M$ , the equality $K + L = M$ implies $L = M$.
An [[epimorphism]] $f : M\to N$ is called superfluous (or coessential) if $Ker f \ll M$.

Superfluous epimorphisms are a notion [[formal duality|dual]] to [[essential monomorphism]]s; their role in the study of [[projective covers]] is analogous to the role of essential monomorphisms in the study of [[injective envelopes]].
