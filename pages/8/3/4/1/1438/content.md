An __initial algebra__ for an [[endofunctor]] $F$ on a category $C$ is an [[initial object]] in the category of [[algebra|algebras]] of $F$.

If $F$ has an initial algebra $\alpha: F(X) \to X$, then $X$ is isomorphic to $F(X)$; in this sense, $X$ is a fixed point of $F$.  Being initial, $X$ is the smallest fixed point of $F$ in that there is a map from $X$ to any other fixed point (indeed, any other algebra), and this map is an [[injection]] if $C$ is [[Set]].

The dual concept is [[terminal coalgebra]].
