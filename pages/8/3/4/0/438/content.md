I was until 2006 a professor of mathematics at the University of Wales Bangor (aka University of Bangor). The University closed down the Mathematics degree and I was retired! Since then I have been on various interesting visiting positions, whilst being Emeritus, retaining an office in the Computer Science section of the university and continuing to work at least as hard as before (I claim).

Not offering a maths degree is one thing, but it seems that they don\'t even have a maths *department*! Who teaches basic maths courses to the CS (and chemistry, biology, electronics, ...) majors? &#8212;[[Toby Bartels|Toby]]

I am writing a series of notes on the theory and application of crossed gadgetry in algebra and topology, and some parts of these notes (approximately first 7 chapters) have been made available on the web at various times. I am currently trying to write new sections on the links between lax methods and homotopy coherence.  


I am also very interested in directed homotopy theory and the application of ideas form the general area of the infinity category/homotopy toolkit in topological data analysis, artificial intelligence, and computer science.
