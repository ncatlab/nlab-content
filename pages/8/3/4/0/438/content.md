I was until 2006 a professor of mathematics at the University of Wales Bangor (aka University of Bangor). The University closed down the Mathematics degree and I was retired! Since then I have been on various interesting visiting positions, whilst being Emeritus, retaining an office in the Computer Science section of the university and continuing to work at least as hard as before (I claim).

Not offering a maths degree is one thing, but it seems that they don\'t even have a maths *department*! Who teaches basic maths courses to the CS (and chemistry, biology, electronics, ...) majors? &#8212;[[Toby Bartels|Toby]]

In the UK, there are several universities that do not have mathematics departments and in which engineers, computer scientists, physicists and chemists do not get any theoretically based mathematics to speak of. Biologists have traditionally received no mathematics training after the age of 16. (Sometimes it shows and is the bane of the statisticians detailed to teach biology students statistics. Note also that quite a few of the so called 'financial  experts' in the UK have little or no maths. Some do, and I am not saying that they were any better in the causes of the recent crisis!) -[[Tim Porter|Tim]]

I am writing a series of notes on the theory and application of crossed gadgetry in algebra and topology, and some parts of these notes (approximately first 7 chapters) have been made available on the web at various times. I am currently trying to write new sections on the links between lax methods and homotopy coherence.  


I am also very interested in directed homotopy theory and the application of ideas form the general area of the infinity category/homotopy toolkit in topological data analysis, artificial intelligence, and computer science.

I have added a series of entries on differential algebra to the nLab.  This is not my expert area and these were produced from a set of notes that I typed up some years ago (based on Tanr&#233;'s SLN 1025).  I think that the terminology needs making 'leaner and meaner'! 



See also my [private $n$Lab area](http://ncatlab.org/timporter/show/HomePage), where I have put a link to a recent version of the first 7 chapters of the Menagerie.

Other goodies there include parts of a draft monograph on [[profinite homotopical algebra]], and a (slightly reformatted) version of a research proposal from 2002, that did not get funded, but may be useful as it does have some ideas in it (or related to it) that are worth pursuing especially since the recent progress on the cobordism and TQFT problems.

I have also put the start of a brief discussion of the relationships between the Cech and Vietoris methods and the newly developed methods of Topological Data Analysis.
