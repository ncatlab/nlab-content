## Idea

A _Galois representation_ is a [[Galois module]] on a [[vector space]].

See at _[[Galois modules]]_ for more.

## Continuous Galois representations

When the Galois group is the [[absolute Galois group]] of a [[number field]] or a finite extension of the [[p-adic numbers]], and the field of scalars of the underlying vector space of the representation is a [[topological field]], one often considers continuous Galois representations (noting that the absolute Galois group is a [[topological group]]).

## Examples

An example of a continuous Galois representation can be obtained by taking the $\ell$-adic Tate module as discussed in the article on [[Galois modules]] and taking its tensor product with $\mathbb{Q}_{\ell}$.

## p-adic Galois representations

Continuous Galois representations of $\mathrm{Gal}(\overline{F}/F)$, where $F$ is a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}_{p}$, over an underlying vector space over $E$, where $E$ is another extension of $\mathbb{Q}_{p}$ (often with some condition that $E$ is big enough) are called _p-adic Galois representations_ (in contrast to $\ell$-adic Galois representations, where the underlying vector space is over some extension of $\mathbb{Q}_{\ell}$, where $\ell$ is another prime not equal to $p$). p-adic Galois representations have a very rich theory (significantly richer and more complicated than $\ell$-adic Galois representations), and their study is part of [[p-adic Hodge theory]].
