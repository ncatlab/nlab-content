## Idea

A famous [[conjecture]] in [[non-perturbative effect|non-perturbative]] [[string theory]] says ([Minasian-Moore 97](#MinasianMoore97), [Witten 98](#Witten98), reviewed in [Moore 02](#Moore02), [Evslin 06](#Evslin06), [Fredenhagen 08](#Fredenhagen08)) that [[D-brane charge]] and [[RR-field]] [[fluxes]] are [[Dirac charge quantization|quantized]] in the [[Whitehead-generalized cohomology theory]] known as [[topological K-theory]], specifically in [[KU]]-cohomology for [[type II string theory]] and more generally in [[KR cohomology theory]] in the presence of [[orientifolds]], reducing to [[KO]]-theory in [[type I string theory]] right on the [[O-planes]].

More generally, the conjecture say that the [[fluxes]] of the NS [[B-field]] and of the [[RR-fields]] are jointly [[Dirac charge quantization|flux-quantized]] in [[twisted topological K-theory]], with the [[B-field]] constituting the twist.

Yet more generally, the conjecture says that, over [[orbifolds]], the [[Dirac charge quantization|charge quantization]] is in [[equivariant K-theory]], hence in [[twisted equivariant K-theory]] for the combined [[B-field]]/[[RR-fields]].

This means, or would mean, that the full physical fields, including the higher "gauge potentials" are [[cocycles]] in a [[differential cohomology]]-version of these [[twisted cohomology|twisted]] [[generalized cohomology theories]], hence in [[differential K-theory]] if the B-field is ignored, in [[twisted differential K-theory]] if the B-field is included, and in [[twisted equivariant differential K-theory]] if also [[orbifolds]] are taken into account.

An immediate way to motivate the conjecture is to notice that the image of the [[B-field]]-[[twisted Chern character]] on [[twisted K-theory]] (say in degree 0, hence in [[type IIA string theory]], for definitess) takes values in $H_3$-[[twisted de Rham cohomology]], whose [[cocycles]] are collections of [[differential forms]] satisfying exactly the [[Bianchi identities]] 

$$
  d \, H_3 = 0
  \,,
  d\, F_{2k + 2} = H_3 \wedge F_{2k}
$$

expected of the [[B-field]] [[flux]] $H_3$ and the [[RR-field]] [[fluxes]] $F_{2k}$.



## Properties

### Holographic relation to K-theory classification of topological phases of matter

Under [[AdS/CFT duality in solid state physics]] the [[K-theory classification of topological phases of matter]] corresponds to the [[K-theory classification of D-brane charge]] ([Ryu-Takayanagi 10a](#RyuTakayanagi10a), [Ryu-Takayanagi 10v](#RyuTakayanagi10b)).
