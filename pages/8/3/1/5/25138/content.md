## Idea

In [[homotopy type theory]], the notion of _reduced suspension type_ is an [[axiom|axiomatization]] of the [[reduced suspension]] in [[pointed topological space|pointed]] [[homotopy theory]].

The [[underlying]] type of a [[pointed type|pointed]] reduced suspension type is [[equivalence in type theory]] to the plain [[suspension type]] of the given underlying type, so that, up to [[equivalence in type theory|equivalence]] one may simply take the reduced suspension to be the plain suspension equipped with any one of its terms as basepoint (e.g, [UFP13, Rem. 8.6.3](#UFP13)).

However, in practice it is sometimes convenient to use a different (even if equivalent) construction of the reduced suspension:

## Definition

### As smash product with the circle type

For a given [[type]] $X$, we follow the conventions of the [[reduced suspension]] article and write $\mathrm{S} X$ for the plain [[suspension type]] of $X$ and $\Sigma X$ for the reduced suspension type of $A$. 

The reduced suspension type of a [[pointed type]] $(X,x)$ with [[basepoint]] [[term]]  $x \colon X$ may be defined as the [[smash product type]] of the [[pointed type|pointed]] [[circle type]] $(S^1, s)$ with $X$:

$$
  \Sigma X 
    \;\coloneqq\; 
  (S^1,s) \wedge (X,x)
  \,.
$$



## Properties

The reduced suspension type of the $n$-sphere type $S^n$ is [[equivalence of types|equivalent to]] the $(n + 1)$-sphere type $S^{n + 1}$

$$\Sigma S^n \simeq S^{n + 1}$$
