## Idea

The _reduced suspension type_ is an [[axiom|axiomatization]] of the [[reduced suspension]] in the context of [[homotopy type theory]].

## Definition

For a given type $A$, we follow the conventions of the [[reduced suspension]] article and write $S A$ for the [[suspension type]] of $A$ and $\Sigma A$ for the reduced suspension type of $A$. 

The reduced suspension type of a [[pointed type]] $A$ with designated element $a:A$ can be defined as the [[smash product type]] of the [[circle type]] with $A$:
$$\Sigma A \coloneqq S^1 \wedge A$$

## Properties

The reduced suspension type of the $n$-sphere type $S^n$ is [[equivalence of types|equivalent to]] the $(n + 1)$-sphere type $S^{n + 1}$

$$\Sigma S^n \simeq S^{n + 1}$$
