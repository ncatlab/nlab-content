What Simons-Sullivan call a _structured bundle_ in

* [[James Simons]], [[Dennis Sullivan]], _Structured vector bundles define differential K-theory_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.4935?context=math.DG))

is a certain [[equivalence class]] of [[vector bundle]]s with [[connection on a bundle|connection]], such that the corresponding [[Grothendieck group]] is a model for [[differential K-theory]].

The equivalence relation divided out is essentially the following:

two connections on a bundle are taken to be equivalent, if the gauge transformation that relates them induces on all possible [[lifting gerbe]]s of the bundle a morphism of gerbes with connection, i.e. a morphism of the corresponding abelian [[differential cohomology|differential cocycles]].

## Details

Details are currently still in a subsection at [[differential K-theory]].
