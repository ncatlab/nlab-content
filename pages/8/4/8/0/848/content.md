## Definition

The [[category]] $sSet_+$ of **augmented simplicial sets** is the category of [[presheaf|presheaves]] on the _augmented_ version of the [[simplex category]] $\Delta_a$:

$$
  sSet_+ := Set^{\Delta^{op}_a}
  \,.
$$

This is the category whose [[object]]s are [[augmented simplicial set]]s and whose [[morphism]]s are the evident morphisms between these.

## Applications

The [[join of simplicial sets]] is most naturally defined via a construction on augmented simplicial sets.
