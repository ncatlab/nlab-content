The [[category]] of **augmented simplicial sets** is the category of [[presheaf|presheaves]] on the _augmented_ version of the [[simplex category]] $\Delta_a$ (the full subcategory of [[Cat]] on finite but possibly _empty_ linear [[quiver]]s):

$$
  ASSet := Set^{\Delta^{op}_a}
  \,.
$$

Compare with the category [[SimpSet]] of ordinary [[simplicial set]]s.


An application is the definition of the [[join of simplicial sets]].
