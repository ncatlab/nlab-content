An [[adjoint functor|adjoint]] pair of functors $F\dashv G$ is a __Frobenius pair__ if
$F$ is not only a left adjoint to $G$ but also a right adjoint to $G$. In such cases one often says that $F$ (or $G$) is a Frobenius functor. Thus we have a special case of an [[adjoint triple]] in which the two adjoints of the middle functor are isomorphic. 

K. Morita proved that the extension of scalars functor for a morphism of rings $f:R\to S$ is Frobenius iff the morphism $f$ itself is Frobenius in the sense of

that is: ${}_R S$ is finitely generated projective and ${}_S S_R\cong Hom_R({}_R S, {}_R R)$ as $R-S$-bimodules. 

This is in the spirit of the finite-dimensional duality coded e.g. in the notion of Frobenius algebra. 

Warning: A [[Frobenius monoidal functor]] is not necessarily a Frobenius functor.
