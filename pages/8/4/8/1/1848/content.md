A [[topological space]] is __second-countable__ if there exists a [[countable set|countable]] [[basis for the topology|basis for its topology]].

Similarly, a [[locale]] is __second-countable__ if there is a countable set $B$ of opens such that every open $G$ is a [[join]] of some [[subset]] of $B$.  In that case, we have
$$ G = \bigvee \{ U\colon B \;|\; U \subseteq G \} .$$
