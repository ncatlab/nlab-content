In [[logic]], a __predicate__ is a statement with (potentially) a free variable in it.  More specifically, a predicate in (say) the variables $x,y,z$ is a statement whose free variables may include $x$, $y$, and $z$; a predicate on (say) the [[type]]s $X,Y,Z$ is a statement whose free variables may include a variable of type $X$, a variable of type $Y$, and a variable of type $Z$.

The term 'proposition' may be used synonymously with 'predicate', or it may be restricted to the case when there are *no* free variables.

In modern logic, it\'s often cleaner to speak of the propositions (or predicates) that can be stated in any given [[context]]; the context specifies the free variables available.
