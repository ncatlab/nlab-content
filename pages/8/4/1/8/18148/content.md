## Definition

A [[magma]] $(S,\cdot)$ is called _unital_ if it has an [[identity element]] $1 \in S$, hence an element such that for all $x \in S$ it satisfies the [[equation]]

$$
  1 \cdot x = x = x \cdot 1
$$

holds. The identity element is [[idempotent]]. 

Some authors take a magma to be unital by default (cf. [[Borceux-Bourn]] Def. 1.2.1). 

There is also a possibly empty version, where the identity element is replaced with a [[constant function]] $1:S \to S$ such that for all $x,y \in S$, $1(x)\cdot y = y$ and $x\cdot 1(y) = x$. 

## Properties

The [[Eckmann-Hilton argument]] holds for unital magmas: two compatible ones on a set must be equal, associative and commutative.

## Examples

Examples include [[unital rings]] etc.
