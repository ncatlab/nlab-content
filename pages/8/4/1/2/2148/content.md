The subject begins with Reidemeister in his study of lens spaces in 193? \cite{redemeister:linsen}??. He considered the co?homology of a manifold $M$ in terms of co?chains of the universal covering space $U$ together with the action of the fundamental group of M as deck transformations. His terminology was _Uberdeckung_ which refers to ??

Steenrod in 1942 \cite{steenrod:tensor} independently generalized the concept of ordinary cohomology to \emph{cohomology with coefficients in a local system of groups}, later known as {cohomology with local coefficients}. In 1943 \cite{steenrod:local}, he acknowledged Reidemeister's precedence  showing that (after a suitable interpretation) the theory includes Reidemeister's concept of Uberdeckung.
In 1947, Eilenberg showed that the cohomology theory with a local system of groups  is naturally equivalent to a theory of equivariant with respect to the dick transformations  of cohomology with ordinary coefficients on the corresponding universal covering space.

In 1950, Olum \cite{olum:obstructions} extended Eilenberg's obstruction theory to the non-simple case, i.e. when the fundamental group acts non trivially on the higher homotopy groups involved.

In the 60s and early 70s, there were several papers addressing operations on cohomology with local coefficients:

In 1972, the phrase _twisted cohomology_ was  used by Larmore \cite{Larmore:single}  to describe 
$H(\  \  ; \mathcal{E})$, cohomology with coefficients in a special kind of spectrum $\mathcal{E}$  related to a fibration $p:E\to B.$ The result is what May and Sigurdsson call a parameterized spectrum,
the _parameters_ being the points of $B$, which might also be called, in the older topological terminology, an _ex-spectrum_.

In recent years, especially after  the invention of twisted K-theory, twisted cohomology has become the generic term, including not only twisted generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology but even what is known as twisted _non-abelian_ cohomolgy. Among other things, non-abelian refers to the fact 
that no spectrum need be involved, but only a single target space, preferably at least a loop space.

Also in 1972 Robinson \cite{robinson: twistedK(pi,n)} constructed Moore-Postnikov systems for non-simple fibrations. In particular, he
provided twisted $K(\pi,n)$s corresponding to cohomology with local coefficients.
