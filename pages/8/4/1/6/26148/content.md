## Idea

In [[probability theory]], a *stochastic map* between [[measurable spaces]] is a ([[linear map|linear]]) map of their [[measures]] which preserves the [[probability measures]] among them.

For [[finite topological space|finite spaces]] --- where a measure is just a [[tuple]] ([[vector]]) of [[non-negative number|non-negative]] [[real numbers]] and a probability measure is such a tuple whose [[sum]] is 1 -- a stochastic map is given by a [[matrix]] all whose columns sum to $1$, called a *stochastic matrix*.

If, on [[compact space|compact]] measureable spaces, a stochastic map also preserves the uniform distribution, then it is called a *doubly stochastic map*.

For the case over [[finite topological space|finite spaces]] this means that the stochastic matrix has not just columns but also rows which sum to unity, then called a *doubly stochastic matrix*.
