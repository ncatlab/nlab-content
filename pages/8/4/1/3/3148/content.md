##Idea
Every [[monad]] induces an augmented cosimplicial [[endofunctor]]; in an [[additive category]] we can produce a cochain complex out of any such cosimplicial endofunctor when applied to any particular object. Taking the [[cohomology]] of that complex yields **monadic cohomology**, see at [canonical resolution](canonical+resolution#monadiccohomology).

This approach has been studied by, in particular, [[Michael Barr]] and [[Jon Beck]].  In addition to their work there is the monograph:
