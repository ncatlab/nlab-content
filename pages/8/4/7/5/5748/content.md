## Definition

### Complex structure on vector spaces

\begin{definition}
\label{LinearComplexStructure}
Given a [[ground field]] $\mathbb{K}$,
_complex structure_ on a $\mathbb{K}$[[vector space]] $V$ is a $\mathbb{K}$-[[linear map]] [[automorphism]] 
$$
  J 
    \,\colon\, 
  V \longrightarrow V
$$ 
that squares to minus the [[identity morphism|identity]]: 
$$
  J \circ J = - Id_V
  \,.
$$
\end{definition}

The idea here is that $J$ acts by multiplication with the would-be [[imaginary unit]] $\mathrm{i}$, and indeed: A [[real vector space]] ($\mathbb{K}$ the [[real numbers]]) equipped with a complex structure $J$ as in Def. \ref{LinearComplexStructure} becomes a [[complex vector space]] by declaring that $\mathrm{i}$ acts via $J$:
$$
  \array{
    \mathbb{C} \times V &\longrightarrow& V
    \\
    \big(
      x + \mathrm{i} \cdot y
      ,\;
      v
    \big)
    &\mapsto&  
    x \cdot v + y \cdot J(v)
  }
$$



### Complex structure on manifolds

More generally, an almost complex structure on a [[smooth manifold]] is a smoothly varying [[fiber]]wise complex structure in the sense of Def. \ref{LinearComplexStructure} on on its [[tangent spaces]] (which a priori are [[real vector spaces]]):

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

An _almost complex structure_ on a [[smooth manifold]] $X$ (of even [[dimension]]) is a rank $(1,1)$-[[tensor field]] $J$, hence a smooth [[section]] $J \in \Gamma(T X \otimes T^* X)$, such that, over each point $x \in X$, $J$ is a linear complex structure, def. \ref{LinearComplexStructure}, on that [[tangent space]] $T_x X$ under the canonical identification $End T_x X \simeq T_x X\otimes T_x^* X$.

Equivalently, stated more intrinsically:

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

An _almost complex structure_ on a [[smooth manifold]] $X$ of [[dimension]] $2 n$ is a [[reduction of the structure group]] of the [[tangent bundle]] to the [[complex numbers|complex]] [[general linear group]] along $GL(n,\mathbb{C}) \hookrightarrow GL(2n,\mathbb{R})$.

+-- {: .num_remark #InTermsOfSmoothStacks}
###### Remark

In terms of modulating maps of bundles into their [[smooth infinity-groupoid|smooth]] [[moduli stacks]], this means that an almost complex structure is a lift in the following [[diagram]] in [[Smooth∞Grpd]]:

$$
  \array{
    && \mathbf{B} GL(n,\mathbb{C})
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{alm.compl.str.}}\nearrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{}}
    \\
    X
    &\underoverset{\tau}{tang.\,bund.}{\to}&
    \mathbf{B} GL(2n,\mathbb{R})
  }
  \,.
$$

By further [[reduction of the structure group|reduction]] along the [[maximal compact subgroup]] inclusion of the [[unitary group]] this yields an [[almost Hermitian structure]]

$$
  \array{
    && \mathbf{B} U(n)
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{herm.alm.compl.str.}}\nearrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{}}
    \\
    X
    &\underoverset{\tau}{tang.\,bund.}{\to}&
    \mathbf{B} GL(2n,\mathbb{R})
  }
  \,.
$$

###### Definition

A _complex structure_ on a [[smooth manifold]] $X$ is the structure of a [[complex manifold]] on $X$. Every such defines  an almost complex structure and almost complex structures arising this way are called _integrable_  (see also at _[[integrability of G-structures]]_ the section _[Examples -- Complex structure](integrability+of+G-structures#ExampleComplexStructure)_).

## Properties

### Characterizations of integrability

The _[[Newlander-Nirenberg theorem]]_ states that an almost complex structure $J$ on a smooth manifold is integrable (see also at _[[integrability of G-structures]]_) precisely if its [[Nijenhuis tensor]] vanishes, $N_J = 0$.

See also at _[[integrability of G-structures]]_ the section _[Examples -- Complex structure](integrability+of+G-structures#ExampleComplexStructure)_.

### On 2-dimensional manifolds


+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Every [[Riemannian metric]] on an [[orientation|oriented]] 2-[[dimension|dimensional]] [[manifold]] induces an almost complex structure given by forming orthogonal tangent vectors.

+-- {: .num_prop #In2dAnyAlmostComplexStructureIsIntegrable}
###### Proposition

Every almost complex structure on a 2-[[dimension|dimensional]] [[manifold]] is integrable, hence is a complex structure.

=--

In the special case of [[real analytic manifolds]] this fact was known to [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]. For the general case see for instance [Audin, remark 3 on p. 47](#Audin).


### Relation to $Spin^c$-structures

Every almost complex structure canonically induces a [[spin^c-structure]] by postcomposition with the universal [[characteristic map]] $\phi$ in the [[diagram]]

$$
  \array{
    \mathbf{B}U(n) &\stackrel{\phi}{\to}& \mathbf{B}Spin^c &\to& \mathbf{B}U(1)
    \\
    &\searrow& \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{}}
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}SO(2n) &\stackrel{\mathbf{w}_2}{\to}& \mathbf{B}^2 \mathbb{Z}_2
  }
  \,.
$$

See at _[[spin^c-structure]]_ for more.

### Relation to Hermitian and K&#228;hler structure

* An almost complex structure equipped with a compatible [[Riemannian metric]] is a _[[Hermitian structure]]_.

* An almost complex structure equipped with a compatible [[Riemannian structure]] and [[symplectic structure]] is a _[[Kähler structure]]_.

| [[complex structure]] | + [[Riemannian structure]] | + [[symplectic structure]] |
|--|--|--|
[[complex structure]] | [[Hermitian structure]] | [[Kähler structure]] |

### Moduli stacks of complex structures

One may consider the [[moduli stack of complex structures]] on a given manifold. For 2-dimensional manifolds these are famous as the Riemann [[moduli stacks of complex curves]]. They may also be expressed as moduli stacks of almost complex structures, see [here](moduli+space+of+curves#OverTheComplexNumbers).
