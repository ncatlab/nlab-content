## Definition

For $V$ a [[real vector space]], the _direction_ of a non-zero vector $v \in V$ is its [[equivalence class]] under multiplication with [[positive number|positive]] [[real numbers]].

If $V$ is equipped with the stucture of a [[normed vector space]] (e.g. an [[inner product space]] with its induced norm $v\mapsto \sqrt{\langle v, v\rangle}$), then the _direction_ of a nonzero element $v \in V$  is equivalently the unit vector

$$
  v/{\vert v\vert} \;\in \; S(V)
  \,,
$$

being an element of the [[unit sphere]] $S(V)$ of $V$. (e.g [MathWorld](#MathWorld)).

Similarly the _unoriented direction_ of a non-zero vector in any vector space is its [[equivalence class]] under multiplication with any non-zero element of the [[ground field]], hence the element it represents in the corresponding [[projective space]] $P V$.

Beware that there is also the concept of _direction vector_ of a line, which is related to "direction _of_ a vector", but is different (see Wikipedia, _[Direction vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direction_vector)_).
