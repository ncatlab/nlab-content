## Definition

An [[(infinity,1)-category|$(\infty, 1)$-category]] $C$ is __locally cartesian__ if each of its [[slice (infinity,1)-category|slice $(\infty, 1)$-categories]] $C/x$ is a [[cartesian monoidal (infinity,1)-category|cartesian monoidal $(\infty, 1)$-category]], meaning that $C/x$ has all finite [[products]]. Another way to say this is that $C$ has all $(\infty, 1)$-[[pullbacks]].

## Properties

In any locally cartesian $(\infty, 1)$-category, the [[base change]] [[(infinity,1)-functor|$(\infty, 1)$-functor]] has a [[left adjoint|left]] [[adjoint (infinity,1)-functor|adjoint $(\infty, 1)$-functor]] called the [[dependent sum]]. 

The [[internal logic]] of a locally cartesian $(\infty, 1)$-category is expected to be a [[dependent type theory]] with [[identity types]] and [[dependent sum types]]. 

## Examples

* Every finitely complete $(\infty, 1)$-category is a locally cartesian $(\infty, 1)$-category with a [[terminal object]].

* Every [[locally cartesian closed (infinity,1)-category|locally cartesian closed $(\infty, 1)$-category]] is a locally cartesian $(\infty, 1)$-category in which the [[base change]] [[(infinity,1)-functor|$(\infty, 1)$-functor]] has a [[right adjoint|right]] [[adjoint (infinity,1)-functor|adjoint $(\infty, 1)$-functor]] called the [[dependent product]].
