## Motivation ##

Recently, [[Johan Alm]] wrote a very neat paper

* [Quantization as a Kan Extension](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/Kantization09May27.pdf)

The paper proves an aspect of 

* [The n-Cafe Quantum Conjecture](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2007/06/the_ncaf_quantum_conjecture.html)

suggested by [[Urs Schreiber]]. A summary of Alm's paper with many motivating references is provided [[Quantization as a Kan Extension|here]].

This page represents an experiment similar to the [[geometric infinity-function theory|Journal Club's]] effort to understand the papers

* **IntTrans** David Ben-Zvi, John Francis, David Nadler, _Integral transforms and Drinfeld Centers in Derived Geometry_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.0157))

* **CharTheo** David Ben-Zvi, David Nadler, _The Character Theory of a Complex Group_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.1247))

The goal is to build up, step-by-step, the background knowledge required to understand Alm's paper. The finite model considered is simple enough that we hope to advance our understanding of elementary concepts that are mostly taken for granted by the experts here at n-Headquarters.

When we are done, we hope to have a complete, self-contained presentation that should be accessible to mildly sophisticated undergraduate physics and mathematics students.

We also hope that the experts will keep an eye on us and when we get stuck, might gently nudge us in the right direction. As always, this page is open to all. Any questions or contributions are more than welcome.

## Collection of Concepts ##

Maybe we can start by skimming the paper and collecting some unfamiliar keywords so that we can begin the process of tracing back definitions.

* [[Kan extension]]
* etc

+--{.On page 3, he writes: "Usually, one has a classical `action' of some kind definedned for manifolds with some extra structure, e.g. a riemannian metric, a symplectic form, a principalbundle, or etc. Quantization is what happens when one tries to assign that same action to a manifold that does not have that structure!" So, what is a manifold without that structure, a topological one? Or less than that? Or is the minimum structure non quantum structure?}
