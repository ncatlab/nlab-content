## Idea

In [[quantum theory]] the [[state]] of a [[physical system]] is given by a [[vector]] in a [[complex vector space]] (usually a [[Hilbert space]]). This means that given any two states $\psi_1$ and $\psi_2$, also their sum as vectors $\psi_1 + \psi_2$ is represents a state. This is called the _quantum superposition_ of the two states.



Since/if these quantum states are thought of as [[wavefunctions]] solving [[linear differential equations]] such as the [[Schroedinger equation]], [[Dirac equation]], [[Klein-Gordon equation]] or [[Tomonaga-Schwinger equation]], their quantum superposition is an example of the general principle of *[[superposition]]* of solutions to [[linear differential equations]].

The concept of quantum superposition is at the heart of what makes [[quantum physics]] peculiar, notably via the phenomenon of [[entanglement]].
