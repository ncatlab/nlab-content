I'm a master's student interested in mathematical physics. Or is it physical mathematics? Here are some things I've been wondering about lately...
* The [general boundary formulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0509122) of quantum field theory.
* Whether or not it would be pedagogically useful to introduce topology as a special case of [[pretopological space|pretopology]].

Welcome, Aaron!  It might be good if you used your full name, although I don\'t think anybody will try to force you.

It also helps if you log your changes in the [latest changes](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Mathforge/nForum/?CategoryID=5) category of the Forum.  In particular, people will be much more likely to look at your work on [[induced representation]] if you do that.

I have also thought that pretopological spaces are pedagogically simpler than topological spaces.  I also like to motivate [[uniform spaces]] as a uniform version of pretopological rather than topological spaces (although we do have the theorem that any pretopological uniform space is topological).  On the other hand, now that I\'m getting to [[locale]] theory, I\'m not as interested in pretopological spaces ....
