##Idea##

A cat^2-group is a [[double groupoid]] (or, equivalently, [[double category]]) internal to the category of groups.


##Discussion##
Cat^2 groups are equivalent to [[crossed square]]s. 

Note that to calculate a colimit it is better to work with crossed squares, but to prove something is a colimit, it is better to work with cat^2-groups. 

Cat^2 groups are a special case of [[cat^n groups]], which are ... n-fold groupoids in the category of groups.

The use of n-fold groupoids in $Grps$ rather than $n+1$ groupoids means that information contained in the \model' is more 'spread out', but is often *repeated* in different forms in different parts of the model.
