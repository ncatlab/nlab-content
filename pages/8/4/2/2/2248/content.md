Any commutative unital [[integral domain|domain]] can be embedded into the smallest [[field]] in a unique way. For noncommutative domains, both the existence and uniqueness do not need to hold, and are difficult to decide. A classical theorem guarantees the existence for a class of Ore domains that is the domains for which the subset of regular elements is an Ore subset; then the corresponding Ore localization is a skewfield and the localization map is an injection. Another important case is the case of free [[associative algebras]]; in that case the solution is not unique and the first embedding was constructed by Amitsur, and by a different procedure by P. M. Cohn. This skewfield is called the __free field__. It has been more recently used in formulating the theory of [[quasideterminants]].
