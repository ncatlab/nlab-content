In [[mathematics]] and specifically in the field of [[algebra]], the term *minor* can refer to

1. a submatrix of a [[matrix]],

2. the [[determinant]] of a square submatrix of a matrix with entries in a [[commutative ring]],

where the second meaning is a bit more standard. 

There is a noncommutative analogue, namely the *quasiminor*, which is the [[quasideterminant]] of a square submatrix of a matrix with entries in a non-[[commutative ring]].
