## Idea

The five [[regular polyhedron|regular]] [[convex set|convex]] [[polyhedron]] in 3-[[dimension|dimensional]] [[Cartesian space]]:

[[tetrahedron]], [[cube]], [[octahedron]], [[dodecahedron]], [[icosahedron]]

## Platonic symmetry groups
 {#PlatonicSymmetryGroups}

Regarding a Platonic solid, determined uniquely up to [[isometry]] on $\mathbb{R}^3$ as a regular convex [[polyhedron]], as a [[metric space|metric]] subspace $S$ of $\mathbb{R}^3$. Then is [[symmetry]] [[group]] may be defined as the group of [[isometries]] of $S$. 

The groups arising this way are called the groups of ADE-type:
