## Idea

The [[model category]] structures on [[functor category|functor categories]] are models for [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-functors|(∞,1)-categories of (∞,1)-functors]].

For $C$ a [[model category]] and $D$ any [[small category]] there are two "obvious" ways to put a [[model category]] structure on the [[functor category]] $[D,C]$, called the _projective_ and the _injective_ model structures.  For completely general $C$, neither one need exist, but there are rather general conditions that ensure their existence.  In particular, the projective model structure exists as long as $C$ is [[cofibrantly generated model category|cofibrantly generated]], while both model structures exist if $C$ is [[accessible model category|accessible]] (and in particular if it is [[combinatorial model category|combinatorial]]).  In the case of [[enriched category|enriched]] diagrams, additional cofibrancy-type conditions are required on $D$.

A related kind of model structure is the [[Reedy model structure]]/[[generalized Reedy model structure]] on functor categories, which applies for *any* model category $C$, but requires $D$ to be a very special sort of category, namely a [[Reedy category]]/[[generalized Reedy category]].

In the special case that $C = $ [[sSet]] is the [[classical model structure on simplicial sets]] the projective and injective model structure on the functor categories $[D,SSet]$ are described in more detail at [[global model structure on simplicial presheaves]] and [[model structure on sSet-enriched presheaves]].

## Definition

Let $\mathbf{S}$ be a [[symmetric monoidal category]], let $C$ be an $\mathbf{S}$-[[model category]] that is an $\mathbf{S}$-[[enriched category]], and let $D$ be a [[small category|small]] $\mathbf{S}$-enriched category. Usually we have either $\mathbf{S}=Set$ or else $\mathbf{S}$ is a [[monoidal model category]] and $C$ an $\mathbf{S}$-[[enriched model category]].

Let $[D,C]$ denote the enriched [[functor category]], whose objects are $\mathbf{S}$-enriched functors $D\longrightarrow C$.

+-- {: .num_defn #ProjectiveAndInjectiveStructure}
###### Definition
We define the following classes of maps in $[D,C]$:

* the **projective weak equivalences** and **projective fibrations** are the [[natural transformations]] that are objectwise such morphisms in $C$.
* the **injective weak equivalences** and **injective cofibrations** are the [[natural transformations]] that are objectwise such morphisms in $C$.

If either of these choices defines a model structure on $[D,C]$, we call it the **projective model structure** $[D,C]_{proj}$ or **injective model structure** $[D,C]_{inj}$ respectively.  Of course, the projective cofibrations and injective fibrations can then be characterized by lifting properties.
=--


## Existence

### Projective case

The projective model structure can be regarded as a right-[[transferred model structure]].  This yields the following basic result on its existence.

+-- {: .num_theorem #CofGenProj}
###### Theorem
Suppose that

1. $C$ is a [[cofibrantly generated model category]], and
2. $C$ admits [[copowers]] by the [[hom-objects]] $D(x,y)\in \mathbf{S}$, which preserve [[acyclic cofibrations]].  (For instance, this is the case if $\mathbf{S}=$ [[Set]], or if $\mathbf{S}$ is a [[monoidal model category]], $C$ is an [[enriched model category|$\mathbf{S}$-model category]], and the [[hom-objects]] $D(x,y)$ are cofibrant in $\mathbf{S}$.)

Then the projective model structure $[D,C]_{proj}$ exists, and is again cofibrantly generated.
=--
+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
Assuming the existence of such copowers, for any $x\in ob(D)$ the "[[evaluation]] at $x$" functor $ev_x \colon [D,C]\longrightarrow C$ has a [[left adjoint]] $F_x$ sending $A\in C$ to the functor $y\mapsto D(x,y)\odot A$, where $\odot$ denotes the [[copower]].  Now if $I$ and $J$ are generating sets of cofibrations and trivial cofibrations for $C$, let $I^D$ be the set of maps $F_x(i)$ in $[D,C]$, for all $i\in I$ and $x\in ob(D)$, and similarly for $J$.  Then the projective fibrations and trivial fibrations are characterized by having the right lifting property with respect to $J^D$ and $I^D$ respectively, while both $I^D$ and $J^D$ permit the [[small object argument]] since $I$ and $J$ do and colimits in $[D,C]$ are pointwise.  Since the trivial fibrations in $[D,C]$ clearly coincide with the fibrations that are weak equivalences, it remains only to show that all $J^D$-cell complexes are weak equivalences.  But a $J^D$-cell complex is objectwise a cell complex built from cells $D(x,y)\odot j$ for maps $j\in J$, and the assumption ensures that these are trivial cofibrations in $C$, hence so is any cell complex built from them.
=--

There do exist projective model structures that do not fall under this theorem, however, such as the following.

+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Theorem
If $C$ is a [[locally presentable category|locally presentable]] [[2-category]] with its [[2-trivial model structure]] and $D$ is a small 2-category, then the projective model structure on $[D,C]$ exists.
=--
+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
This follows from the result of [Lack](#Lack06) on [[transferred model structures]] for algebras over [[2-monads]], since $[D,C]$ is the category of algebras for an accessible 2-monad on $C^{ob(D)}$.
=--

Note that $C$ need not be cofibrantly generated (and the 2-trivial model structure often fails to be cofibrantly generated), so the generality of this result is not entirely included in the previous one.


### Accessible case

In the case when $C$ is an [[accessible model category]], i.e. it is a [[locally presentable category]] and its constituent [[weak factorization systems]] have [[accessible functor|accessible]] realizations as [[functorial factorizations]], we have the following general result from [Moser](#Moser) (the unenriched case appears in [HKRS15](#HKRS15) and [GKR18](#GKR18)).

\begin{theorem}\label{Accessible}
Let 

* $\mathbf{S}$ be a [[locally presentable category|locally presentable]] [[cosmos]]

* $C$ an $\mathbf{S}$-cocomplete locally $\mathbf{S}$-presentable $\mathbf{S}$-[[enriched category]] that is an [[accessible model category]], 

* $D$ a [[small category|small]] $\mathbf{S}$-category.  

Then:

1. If [[copowers]] by the [[hom-objects]] $D(x,y)$ preserve [[acyclic cofibrations]], then the projective model structure on $[D,C]$ exists and is accessible.

1. If [[copowers]] by the hom-objects $D(x,y)$ preserve [[cofibrations]], then the injective model structure on $[D,C]$ exists and is accessible

\end{theorem}


### Combinatorial case
 {#CombinatorialCase}

Every [[combinatorial model category]] (i.e. locally presentable and cofibrantly generated) is accessible, so Theorem \ref{Accessible} shows that both model structures exist, and Theorem \ref{CofGenProj} shows that the projective model structure is cofibrantly generated, hence (by [this Prop.](locally+presentable+category#PresheavesWithValuesInLocPresAreLocPres)) also [[combinatorial model category|combinatorial]].  

In fact the injective model structure is also combinatorial, although the proof is much more involved, because there is no explicit description of the generating cofibrations and acyclic cofibrations; they have to be produced by a cardinality argument.  This was first proven by in [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, prop. A.2.8.2 and A.3.3.2]] under strong assumptions on the enriching category (in particular that all objects are cofibrant), and later generalized by [Makkai & Rosický 2014](#MakkaiRosický14) to essentially the following:

\begin{theorem}\label{Combinatorial}
Let $\mathbf{S}$ be a [[locally presentable category|locally presentable]] [[cosmos]], $C$ an $\mathbf{S}$-cocomplete locally $\mathbf{S}$-presentable $\mathbf{S}$-[[enriched category]] that is a [[combinatorial model category]], and $D$ a small $\mathbf{S}$-category.  Then:

1. If [[copowers]] by the hom-objects $D(x,y)$ preserve trivial cofibrations, then the projective model structure on $[D,C]$ exists and is combinatorial.

1. If [[copowers]] by the hom-objects $D(x,y)$ preserve cofibrations, then the injective model structure on $[D,C]$ exists and is combinatorial.

\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
It suffices to construct the factorizations, which follows from [Makkai & Rosický 2014, Remark 3.8](#MakkaiRosický14) about left-lifting combinatorial weak factorization systems.
\end{proof}

## Properties

### General

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The projective and injective structures $[D,C]_{proj}$ and $[D,C]_{inj}$, def. \ref{ProjectiveAndInjectiveStructure}, are (insofar as they exist):

* right or left [[proper model categories]] if $C$ is right or left proper, respectively.

* $\mathbf{S}$-[[enriched model categories]] if $C$ is an $\mathbf{S}$-model category.

=--

The statement about properness appears as [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, remark A.2.8.4]].

+-- {: .num_prop #PresentationOfInfinityFunctors}
###### Proposition

For $C$ a [[combinatorial simplicial model category]], the [[(∞,1)-category]] [[presentable (∞,1)-category|presented by]] $[D,C]_{proj}$ and $[D,C]_{inj}$ under the above assumptions is the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-functors]] $Func(D,C^\circ)$ from the ordinary category $D$ to the $(\infty,1)$-category presented by $C$.

=--

See at *[[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-functors]]* for more.


### Relation to other model structures

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition
If [[copowers]] by the hom-objects of $D$ preserve trivial cofibrations, then every every fibration in $[D,C]_{inj}$ is in particular a fibration in $[D,C]_{proj}$.  Similarly, if [[powers]] by the hom-objects of $D$ preserve trivial fibrations, then every cofibration in $[D,C]_{proj}$ is in particular a cofibration in $[D,C]_{inj}$.  The hypotheses are satisfied if $D$ is unenriched, or in the monoidal model category case if the hom-objects of $D$ are cofibrant.
=--

This is argued in the beginning of the proof of [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, lemma A.2.8.3]].  For $Top$-enriched functors, this is ([Piacenza 91, section 5](#Piacenza91)). For details see at _[classical model structure on topological spaces -- Model structure on enriched functors](classical+model+structure+on+topological+spaces#ModelStructureOnTopEnrichedFunctors)_.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
If $i:A\longrightarrow B$ is a trivial cofibration in $C$ and $x\in ob(D)$, then the first assumption implies that $F_x(i) : F_x(A) \longrightarrow F_x(B)$, for $F_x(A) (y) = D(x,y) \odot A$ the left adjoint of $ev_x : [D,C] \longrightarrow C$, is a trivial cofibration in $[D,C]_{inj}$.  Thus, any fibration $p$ in $[D,C]_{inj}$ has the right lifting property with respect to it, which is to say that $ev_x(p)$ has the right lifting property with respect to $i$.  Since this is true for any $i$, each $ev_x(p)$ is a fibration, i.e. $p$ is a fibration in $[D,C]_{inj}$.  The other half is dual.
=--

+-- {: .num_cor}
###### Corollary

The [[identity functors]]

$$
  [D,C]_{inj}
    \stackrel{\overset{Id}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{Id}{\longrightarrow}}
  [D,C]_{proj}
$$

form a [[Quillen equivalence]] (with $Id : [D,C]_{proj} \longrightarrow [D,C]_{inj}$ being the left Quillen functor).

If $D$ is a [[Reedy category]] this factors through the [[Reedy model structure]]

$$
  [D,C]_{inj}
    \stackrel{\overset{Id}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{Id}{\longrightarrow}}
  [D,C]_{Reedy}
    \stackrel{\overset{Id}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{Id}{\longrightarrow}}
  [D,C]_{proj}
$$

=--

### Functoriality in domain and codomain

+-- {: .num_prop #QuillenFunctorialityInCodomain}
###### Proposition

The functor model structures depend [[Quillen adjunction|Quillen-functorially]] on their [[codomain]], in that for

$$
  D_1
  \stackrel
    {\overset{L}{\longleftarrow}}
    {\underset{R}{\longrightarrow}}
  D_2
$$

an $\mathbf{S}$-[[enriched Quillen adjunction]] between [[combinatorial model categories|combinatorial]] $\mathbf{S}$-[[enriched model categories]], postcomposition induces $\mathbf{S}$-[[enriched Quillen adjunctions]]

$$
  [C,D_1]_{proj}
    \stackrel
      {\overset{[C,L]}{\longleftarrow}}
      {\underset{[C,R]}{\longrightarrow}}
  [C,D_2]_{proj}
$$

and

$$
  [C,D_1]_{inj}
    \stackrel
      {\overset{[C,L]}{\longleftarrow}}
      {\underset{[C,R]}{\longrightarrow}}
  [C,D_2]_{inj}
  \,.
$$

Moreover, if $(L \dashv R)$ is a [[Quillen equivalence]], then so is $([C,L] \dashv [C,R])$.

=--

For the case that $C$ is a small category this is &lbrack;[Lurie, remark A.2.8.6](#Lurie)&rbrack;, for the enriched case this is &lbrack;[Lurie, prop. A.3.3.6](#Lurie)&rbrack;.



The Quillen-functoriality on the [[domain]] is more asymmetric.

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

For $p : C_1 \longrightarrow C_2$ a functor between small categories or an $\mathbf{S}$-[[enriched functor]] between $\mathbf{S}$-[[enriched categories]], let

$$
  (p_! \dashv p^* \dashv p_*)
  \;\colon\;
  [C_2,D]
  \stackrel{\overset{p_!}{\longleftarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{p^*}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{p_*}{\longleftarrow}}}
 [C_1,D]
$$

be the [[adjoint triple]] where $p^*$ is precomposition with $p$ and where $p_!$ and $p_*$ are left and right [[Kan extension]] along $p$, respectively.

Then we have [[Quillen adjunctions]]

$$
  (p_! \dashv p^*) 
  \;\colon\;
  [C_1,D]_{proj} \stackrel{\overset{p_!}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{p^*}{\longleftarrow}}
  [C_2,D]_{proj}
$$

and

$$
  (p^* \dashv p_*)
  \;\colon\;
  [C_1,D]_{inj} \stackrel{\overset{p^*}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{p_*}{\longrightarrow}}
  [C_2,D]_{inj}
  \,.
$$


=--

For $C$ not enriched this appears as &lbrack;[Lurie, prop. A.2.8.7](#Lurie)&rbrack;, for the enriched case it appears as &lbrack;[Lurie, prop. A.3.3.7](#Lurie)&rbrack;.

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

In the $sSet$-enriched case, if $p : D_1 \longrightarrow D_2$ is a [[weak equivalence]] in the [[model structure on sSet-categories]], then these two Quillen adjunctions are both [[Quillen equivalence]]s.

=--



### Relation to homotopy Kan extensions/limits/colimits

Often functors $D \longrightarrow C$ are thought of as [[diagram]]s in the model category $C$, and one is interested in obtaining their [[homotopy limit]] or [[homotopy colimit]] or, generally, for $p : D \longrightarrow D'$ any functor, their left and right [[homotopy Kan extension]].

These are the left and right [[derived functor]]s $HoLan := \mathbb{L} p_1$ and $HoRan := \mathbb{R} p_*$ of

$$
  [D,C]_{proj} \stackrel{p_!}{\longrightarrow}  [D',C]_{proj}
$$

and

$$
  [D,C]_{inj} \stackrel{p_*}{\longrightarrow} [D',C]_{inj}
$$

respectively.

For more on this see [[homotopy Kan extension]]. For the case that $D' = *$ this reduces to [[homotopy limit]] and [[homotopy colimit]].
