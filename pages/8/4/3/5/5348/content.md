A non-zero [[polynomial]] $f$ with coefficients in a field $k$ is **irreducible** if when written as the product $g h$ of two other polynomials, one of $g$ or $h$ is a constant non-zero polynomial. Under this definition, a polynomial $f$ is irreducible if the [[ideal]] it generates is a [[maximal ideal]] of the polynomial ring $k[x]$. 

In other words, a polynomial $f$ is irreducible if it is an [[irreducible element]] of $k[x]$ as an [[integral domain]]. 

Notice that under this definition, the zero polynomial is not considered to be irreducible. An alternative definition, which applies to the case of coefficients in a commutative ring $R$, is that a polynomial $f$ is irreducible if, whenever $f$ divides $g h$, either $f$ divides $g$ or $f$ divides $h$. Under this definition, a polynomial is irreducible if it generates a prime ideal in $R[x]$, and the zero polynomial is irreducible if $R$ is an integral domain.
