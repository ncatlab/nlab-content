A non-zero [[polynomial]] $f$ with coefficients in a field $k$ is **irreducible** if when written as the product $g h$ of two other polynomials, one of $g$ or $h$ is a constant non-zero polynomial. 

In other words, a polynomial $f$ is irreducible if it is an [[irreducible element]] of $k[x]$ as an [[integral domain]].
