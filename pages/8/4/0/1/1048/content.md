#Definition#

A **filtrant category** is an [[inhabited set|non-empty]] [[category]] $C$ with the following two [[stuff, structure, property|properties]]:

* for all pairs of [[object]]s $c,d \in C$ there exists an object $e \in C$ and [[morphism]]s $c \to e$ and $d \to e$;

* for all pairs $f,g : c \to d$ of [[parallel morphisms]] there is a [[morphism]] $h : d \to e$ equalizing them.


#Examples#

* A [[poset]] which is filtrant is a [[directed set]].

* Every categor with a [[terminal object]] is filtrant.

* Every category which has finite [[colimit]]s is filtrant.

* Every [[cartesian product]] of filtrant categories is filtrant.

#Properties#

* [[colimit|Colimits]] over filtrant categories commute with finite [[limit]]s.
