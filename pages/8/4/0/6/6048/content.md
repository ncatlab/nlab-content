## Idea

The theory of [[11-dimensional supergravity]] contains a higher [[gauge field]] -- the [[supergravity C-field]] -- that naturally couples to higher electrically charged 2-[[brane]]s ([[membrane]]s). By a process called _double dimensional_ reduction, these are related to [[superstrings]] ([Bergshoeff-Sezgin-Townsend 87](#BergshoeffSezginTownsend87)).

When in ([Witten95](#Witten95)) it was argued that the 10-dimensional [[target space]] theories of the five types of [[string theory|superstring theories]] are all limiting cases of one single 11-dimensional target space theory that extends [[11-dimensional supergravity]] ([[M-theory]]), it was natural to guess that this supergravity membrane accordingly yields a 3-dimensional [[sigma-model]] that reduces in limiting cases to the [[string]] [[sigma-models]].

But there were two aspects that make this idea a little subtle, even at this vague level: first, there is no good theory of the [[quantization]] of the membrane [[sigma-model]], as opposed to the well understood quantum [[string]]. Secondly,  Secondly, that hypothetical "theory extending 11-dimensional supergravity" ("M-theory") has remained elusive enough that it is not clear in which sense the membrane would relate to it in a way analogous to how the string relates to its [[target space]] theories (which is fairly well understood).

Later, with the [[BFSS matrix model]] some people gained
more confidence in the idea, by identifying the corresponding degrees
of freedom in a special case ([Nicolai-Helling 98](#NicolaiHelling98)).

In a more modern perspective, the M2-brane [[worldvolume]] theory appears under _[AdS4-CFT3 duality](AdS-CFT#AdS4CFT3)_ as a [[holographic principle|holographic dual]] of a [[4-dimensional Chern-Simons theory]]. Indeed, its [[Green-Schwarz action functional]] is entirely controled by the [[super Lie algebra|super]]-[[Lie algebra cocycle|Lie algebra 4-cocycle]] of [[super Minkowski spacetime]] given by the [[brane scan]]. This exhibits the M2-brane worldvolume theory as a 3-dimensional [[schreiber:∞-Wess-Zumini-Witten theory|higher WZW model]].



## Properties

### M2-branes at orbifold fixed points -- BLG and ABJM

In some situations stacks of M2-branes are accurately described by [[ABJM theory]] of the [[BLG model]].

### AdS4-CFT3 duality

Under [[AdS-CFT duality]] the M2-brane is given by
_[AdS4-CFT3 duality](AdS-CFT#AdS4CFT3)_. ([Maldacena 97, section 3.2](#Maldacena97), [Klebanov-Torri 10](#KlebanovTorri10)).
