## Idea

The theory of [[11-dimensional supergravity]] contains a higher [[gauge field]] -- the [[supergravity C-field]] -- that naturally couples to higher electrically charged 2-[[brane]]s ([[membrane]]s). By a process called _[[double dimensional reduction]]_, these are related to [[superstrings]] ([Bergshoeff-Sezgin-Townsend 87](#BergshoeffSezginTownsend87)).

When in ([Witten95](#Witten95)) it was argued that the 10-dimensional [[target space]] theories of the five types of [[string theory|superstring theories]] are all limiting cases of one single 11-dimensional target space theory that extends [[11-dimensional supergravity]] ([[M-theory]]), it was natural to guess that this supergravity membrane accordingly yields a 3-dimensional [[sigma-model]] that reduces in limiting cases to the [[string]] [[sigma-models]].

But there were two aspects that make this idea a little subtle, even at this vague level: first, there is no good theory of the [[quantization]] of the membrane [[sigma-model]], as opposed to the well understood quantum [[string]]. Secondly, that hypothetical "theory extending 11-dimensional supergravity" ("M-theory") has remained elusive enough that it is not clear in which sense the membrane would relate to it in a way analogous to how the string relates to its [[target space]] theories (which is fairly well understood).

Later, with the [[BFSS matrix model]] some people gained
more confidence in the idea, by identifying the corresponding degrees
of freedom in a special case ([Nicolai-Helling 98](#NicolaiHelling98), [Dasgupta-Nicolai-Plefka 02](#DasguptaNicolaiPlefka02)). See also at _[[membrane matrix model]]_. 

In a more modern perspective, the M2-brane [[worldvolume]] theory appears under _[AdS4-CFT3 duality](AdS-CFT#AdS4CFT3)_ as a [[holographic principle|holographic dual]] of a [[4-dimensional Chern-Simons theory]]. Indeed, its [[Green-Schwarz action functional]] is entirely controled by the [[super Lie algebra|super]]-[[Lie algebra cocycle|Lie algebra 4-cocycle]] of [[super Minkowski spacetime]] given by the [[brane scan]]. This exhibits the M2-brane worldvolume theory as a 3-dimensional [[higher dimensional WZW model]].

## Definition

There are two different incarnations of the M2-brane. On the one hand it is defined as a [[Green-Schwarz sigma model]] with [[target space]] a [[spacetime]] that is a solution to the [[equations of motion]] of [[11-dimensional supergravity]]. One would call this the "fundamental" M2 in analogy with the "fundamental string", if only there were an "M2-perturbation series" which however is essentially ruled out.

On the other hand the M2 also appears as a [[black brane]], hence as a solution to the [[equations of motion]] of [[11-dimensional supergravity]] with [[singularity]] that looks from outside like a charged 2 dimensional object. 

### As a Green-Schwarz sigma model

See at _[[Green-Schwarz sigma model]]_ and _[[brane scan]]_.

### As a black brane
 {#AsABlackBrane}

As a [[black brane]] solution to the [[equations of motion]] of [[11-dimensional supergravity]] the M2 is the [[spacetime]] $\mathbb{R}^{2,1} \times (\mathbb{R}^8-\{0\})$ with [[pseudo-Riemannian metric]] being

$$
  g = H^{-2/3} g_{\mathbb{R}^{2,1}} + H^{1/3}g_{\mathbb{R}^8-\{0\}}
$$

where 

$$
  H = \alpha + \frac{\beta}{r^6}
$$

for $(\alpha,\beta) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \setminus \{(0,0)\}$;

and the [[field strength]] of the [[supergravity C-field]] is 

$$
  F = d vol_{\mathbb{R}^{2,1}} \wedge \mathbf{d} H^{-1}
  \,.
$$

For $\alpha \beta \neq 0$ this is a 1/2 [[BPS state]] of 11d sugra.

In the above [[coordinates]] the metric is ill-defined at $r = - \beta^{1/6} \alpha$, but in fact it may be smoothly continued through this point ([Duff-Gibbons-Townsend 94, section 3](#DuffGibbonsTownsend94)), which is a [[event horizon]]. An actual singularity is at $r = 0$.


The [[near horizon geometry]] of this spacetime is the [[Freund-Rubin compactification]] [[anti de Sitter spacetime|AdS4]]$\times$[[7-sphere|S7]]. For more on this see at _[[AdS-CFT]]_.

[[!include black branes in supergravity -- table]]

{#BlackM2AtADESingularity} More generally, one may classify those solutions of [[11-dimensional supergravity]] of the form $AdS_4 \times X_7$ for some [[closed manifold]] $X_7$, that are at least 1/2 [[BPS states]]. One finds ([Medeiros-Figueroa 10](#MedeirosFigueroa10)) that all these are of the form $AdS_4 \times S^7/G_{ADE}$, where $S^7 / G_{ADE}$ is an [[orbifold]] of the [[7-sphere]] (a [[spherical space form]] in the smooth case, see [there](spherical+space+form#7DSphericalSpaceFormsWithSpinStructure)) by a [[finite subgroup of SU(2)]] $G_{ADE} \hookrightarrow SU(2)$, i.e. a finite group in the [[ADE-classification]]

[[!include ADE -- table]]

Here for $ 5 \leq \mathcal{N} \leq 8$-supersymmetry then the action of $G_{ADE}$ on $S^7$ is via the canonical action of $SU(2)$ as in the [[quaternionic Hopf fibration]] ([Medeiros-Figueroa 10](#MedeirosFigueroa10)), while for $\mathcal{N} = 4$ then there is an extra twist to the action  ([MFFGME 09](#MFFGME09)). See the table [below](#WorldvolumeTheory).



## Properties

### Worldvolume theory -- BLG and ABJM
 {#WorldvolumeTheory}

The [[worldvolume]] [[QFT]] of [[black brane|black]] M2-branes is a [[3d superconformal gauge field theory]]:

[[!include superconformal symmetry -- table]]

Specifically, [[worldvolume]] [[quantum field theory]] of M2-branes sitting at [[ADE singularities]] (as [above](#BlackM2AtADESingularity)) is supposed to be described by [[ABJM theory]] and, for the special case of $SU(2)$ gauge group, by the [[BLG model]]. See also at _[[gauge enhancement]]_.

### AdS4-CFT3 duality

Under [[AdS-CFT duality]] the M2-brane is given by
_[AdS4-CFT3 duality](AdS-CFT#AdS4CFT3)_. ([Maldacena 97, section 3.2](#Maldacena97), [Klebanov-Torri 10](#KlebanovTorri10)).
