## Idea

The theory of [[11-dimensional supergravity]] contains a higher [[gauge field]] -- the [[supergravity C-field]] -- that naturally couples to higher electrically charged 2-[[branes]], [[membranes]] ([Bergshoeff-Sezgin-Townsend 87](#BergshoeffSezginTownsend87)). By _[[double dimensional reduction]]_, these turn into the [[superstrings]] of [[type IIA string theory]] ([Duff-Howe-Inami-Stelle 87](#DuffHoweInamiStelle87)). (See at _[[duality between M-theory and type IIA string theory]]_.)

When in ([Witten95](#Witten95)) it was argued that the 10-dimensional [[target space]] theories of the five types of [[string theory|superstring theories]] are all limiting cases of one single 11-dimensional target space theory that extends [[11-dimensional supergravity]] ([[M-theory]]), it was natural to guess that this supergravity membrane accordingly yields a 3-dimensional [[sigma-model]] that reduces in limiting cases to the [[string]] [[sigma-models]].

But there were two aspects that make this idea a little subtle, even at this vague level: first, there is no good theory of the [[quantization]] of the membrane [[sigma-model]], as opposed to the well understood quantum [[string]]. Secondly, that hypothetical "theory extending 11-dimensional supergravity" ("M-theory") has remained elusive enough that it is not clear in which sense the membrane would relate to it in a way analogous to how the string relates to its [[target space]] theories (which is fairly well understood).

Later, with the [[BFSS matrix model]] some people gained
more confidence in the idea, by identifying the corresponding degrees
of freedom in a special case ([Nicolai-Helling 98](#NicolaiHelling98), [Dasgupta-Nicolai-Plefka 02](#DasguptaNicolaiPlefka02)). See also at _[[membrane matrix model]]_. 

In a more modern perspective, the M2-brane [[worldvolume]] theory appears under _[AdS4-CFT3 duality](AdS-CFT#AdS4CFT3)_ as a [[holographic principle|holographic dual]] of a [[4-dimensional Chern-Simons theory]]. Indeed, its [[Green-Schwarz action functional]] is entirely controled by the [[super Lie algebra|super]]-[[Lie algebra cocycle|Lie algebra 4-cocycle]] of [[super Minkowski spacetime]] given by the [[brane scan]]. This exhibits the M2-brane worldvolume theory as a 3-dimensional [[higher dimensional WZW model]].

## Definition

There are two different incarnations of the M2-brane. On the one hand it is defined as a [[Green-Schwarz sigma model]] with [[target space]] a [[spacetime]] that is a solution to the [[equations of motion]] of [[11-dimensional supergravity]]. One would call this the "fundamental" M2 in analogy with the "fundamental string", if only there were an "M2-perturbation series" which however is essentially ruled out.

On the other hand the M2 also appears as a [[black brane]], hence as a solution to the [[equations of motion]] of [[11-dimensional supergravity]] with [[singularity]] that looks from outside like a charged 2 dimensional object. 

### As a Green-Schwarz sigma model

### As a black brane
 {#AsABlackBrane}

#### In the absence of 4-flux

As a [[black brane]] solution to the [[equations of motion]] of [[11-dimensional supergravity]], with vanishing [[C-field]] [[flux]], the M2 is the [[spacetime]] $\mathbb{R}^{2,1} \times (\mathbb{R}^8-\{0\})$ with [[pseudo-Riemannian metric]] being

$$
  g = H^{-2/3} g_{\mathbb{R}^{2,1}} + H^{1/3}g_{\mathbb{R}^8-\{0\}}
$$

where 

$$
  H = \alpha + \frac{\beta}{r^6}
$$

for $(\alpha,\beta) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \setminus \{(0,0)\}$;

and the [[field strength]] of the [[supergravity C-field]] is 

$$
  F = d vol_{\mathbb{R}^{2,1}} \wedge \mathbf{d} H^{-1}
  \,.
$$

For $\alpha \beta \neq 0$ this is a 1/2 [[BPS state]] of 11d sugra.

In the above [[coordinates]] the metric is ill-defined at $r = - \beta^{1/6} \alpha$, but in fact it may be smoothly continued through this point ([Duff-Gibbons-Townsend 94, section 3](#DuffGibbonsTownsend94)), which is a [[event horizon]]. An actual singularity is at $r = 0$.


The [[near horizon geometry]] of this spacetime is the [[Freund-Rubin compactification]] [[anti de Sitter spacetime|AdS4]]$\times$[[7-sphere|S7]]. For more on this see at _[[AdS-CFT]]_.

[[!include black branes in supergravity -- table]]

{#BlackM2AtADESingularity} More generally, one may classify those solutions of [[11-dimensional supergravity]] of the form $AdS_4 \times X_7$ for some [[closed manifold]] $X_7$, that are at least 1/2 [[BPS states]]. One finds ([Medeiros-Figueroa 10](#MedeirosFigueroa10)) that all these are of the form $AdS_4 \times S^7/G_{ADE}$, where $S^7 / G_{ADE}$ is an [[orbifold]] of the [[7-sphere]] (a [[spherical space form]] in the smooth case, see [there](spherical+space+form#7DSphericalSpaceFormsWithSpinStructure)) by a [[finite subgroup of SU(2)]] $G_{ADE} \hookrightarrow SU(2)$, i.e. a finite group in the [[ADE-classification]]

[[!include ADE -- table]]

Here for $ 5 \leq \mathcal{N} \leq 8$-supersymmetry then the action of $G_{ADE}$ on $S^7$ is via the canonical action of $SU(2)$ as in the [[quaternionic Hopf fibration]] ([Medeiros-Figueroa 10](#MedeirosFigueroa10)), while for $\mathcal{N} = 4$ then there is an extra twist to the action  ([MFFGME 09](#MFFGME09)). See the table [below](#WorldvolumeTheory).


#### In the presence of 4-flux
 {#BlackM2BranesInThePresenceOfG4Flux}

In the presence of non-vanishing [[C-field]] [[flux]] $G_4$, the electric [[flux density]] of [[M2-branes]] is not $G_7 \coloneqq \star G_4$ alone, but receives corrections, first due to the quadratic [[C-field]] self-interaction in [[D=11 supergravity]], but then also due to the [[shifted C-field flux quantization]] expected in [[M-theory]]:

\linebreak

**The [[11d supergravity]] literature** states the corrected 7-flux to be the following combination, also known as the _[[Page charge]]_ (due to [Page 83 (8)](#Page83), [Duff-Stelle 91 (43)](#DuffStelle91), reviewed e.g. in [BLMP 13, p. 21](#BaggerLambertMukhiPapageorgakis13)):

\[
  \label{FirstCorrectionToG7}
  \widetilde G'_7 
  \;\coloneqq\;
  G_7 + \tfrac{1}{2} C_3 \wedge G_4
  \,,
\]

where the second term subtracts the electric flux induced by the self-intersection of the [[field]], and also ensures that the full expression is a [[closed differential form]] if the naive [[11d supergravity]] [[equations of motion]] hold:

$$
  d \widetilde G_7
  \;=\;
  0
  \,.
$$

But in fact (eq:FirstCorrectionToG7) does not quite make general sense, for two reasons:

1. In general $G_4 = 0$ is not an admissible condition and is not the actual vanshing of the [[C-field]], due to the [[shifted C-field flux quantization]].

1. Even if $G_4$ happens to be integrally quantizaed (if $\tfrac{1}{4}p_1$ is integral) the appearance of a globally defined [[C-field]] potential $C_3$ in (eq:FirstCorrectionToG7),means that the total [[flux]] actually does vanish after all.

\linebreak

**Charge-quantized $\widetilde G_7$-flux with [[shifted C-field flux quantization]]** ([FSS 19b, Prop. 4.3](#FSS19b), [FSS 19c, Section 4](#FSS19c))

Both of these issues are solved if the [[C-field]] is taken to be [[charge quantization|charge quantized]] in [[J-homomorphism|J-]][[twisted Cohomotopy]] ([[schreiber:Hypothesis H]]). This gives the corrected formula 

\[
  \label{FullCorrectionToG7}
  \widetilde G_7 
  \;\coloneqq\;
  h^\ast G_7 + \tfrac{1}{2} H_3 \wedge h^\ast \widetilde G_4
\]

where

<div style="float:right;margin:0 10px 10px 0;">
<a href="">
<img src="https://ncatlab.org/schreiber/files/6dWZFromHomotopyLifting.jpg" width="440" />
</a></div>

1. the expression lives on the [[homotopy pullback]] of the [[Sp(2)]]-[[parametrized homotopy theory|parametrized]] [[quaternionic Hopf fibration]] 

   $$
     h \coloneqq h_{\mathbb{H}}\sslash Sp(2)
   $$ 

   to [[spacetime]], along the [[twisted Cohomotopy]]-[[cocycle]] that represents the [[C-field]] under [[schreiber:Hypothesis H]];

1. $\widetilde G_4 \coloneqq h^\ast G_4 + \tfrac{1}{4}h^\ast p_1(\nabla)$ is the integral [[shifted C-field flux quantization|shifted C-field]] pulled back to that 3-[[spherical fibration]] over spacetime;

1. $d H_3 = h^\ast G_4 - \tfrac{1}{4}h^\ast p_1(\nabla)$ trivializes not the C-field itself, but its pullback, and not absolutely but relative to the background charge implied by [[shifted C-field flux quantization]].

With the corrected 7-flux in [[twisted Cohomotopy]] it becomes true that 

1. the integral of $G_7$ around the [[7-sphere]] linking a [[black brane|black]] [[M2-brane]] is always [[integer]] ([FSS 19c, Theorem 4.6](#FSS19c));

1. this integer satisfies the [[C-field tadpole cancellation condition]] ([FSS 19b, Section 4.6](#FSS19b)).




## Properties

### Quantization via BFSS matrix model
 {#QuantizationViaBFSSMatrixModel}

A regularized [[quantization]] of the [[Green-Schwarz sigma-model]] for the [[M2-brane]] yields the [[BFSS matrix model]] ([Nicolai-Helling 98](#NicolaiHelling98), [Dasgupta-Nicolai-Plefka 02](#DasguptaNicolaiPlefka02)). 

In this correspondence, [[matrix]] blocks around the diagonal correspond to blobs of [[membrane]], while off-diagonal matrix elements correspond to thin tubes of membrane connecting these blobs.

Specifically, [[worldvolume]] [[quantum field theory]] of M2-branes sitting at [[ADE singularities]] (as [above](#BlackM2AtADESingularity)) is supposed to be described by [[ABJM theory]] and, for the special case of $SU(2)$ gauge group, by the [[BLG model]]. See also at _[[gauge enhancement]]_.
