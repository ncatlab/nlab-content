## Idea

The _enriched Yoneda lemma_ is the generalization of the usual [[Yoneda lemma]] from [[category theory]] to [[enriched category theory]]. 

## Statement

We discuss here two forms of the Yoneda lemma. 

Let $V$ be a ([[locally small category|locally small]]) [[closed monoidal category|closed]] [[symmetric monoidal category]], so that $V$ is enriched in itself via its [[internal hom]].


### Weak form

 A _weak form_ of the enriched Yoneda lemma says that given a $V$-[[enriched functor]] $F: C \to V$ and an object $c$ of $C$, the _[[set]]_ of $V$-[[enriched natural transformation]]s $\alpha: \hom_C(c, -) \to F$ is in [[natural isomorphism|natural bijection]] with the set of elements of $F(c)$, i.e., the set of morphisms $I \to F(c)$, obtained by composition: 

$$I \stackrel{1_c}{\to} \hom_C(c, c) \stackrel{\alpha c}{\to} F(c)$$

### Strong form

Now suppose that $V$ is in addition (small-)complete (has all small [[limit]]s). Then, given a [[small category|small]] $V$-[[enriched category]] $C$ and $V$-[[enriched functor]]s $F, G: C \to V$, one may construct the _object_ of $V$-natural transformations as an enriched [[end]]: 

$$V^C(F, G) = \int_c V(F(c), G(c))$$ 

(which may in turn be expressed as an ordinary limit in $V$). This is the [[hom-object]] in the [[enriched functor category]].


A _strong form_ of the enriched Yoneda lemma specifies a $V$-[[natural isomorphism]]

$$V^C(\hom_C(d, -), F) = \int_c V(\hom_C(d,c),F(c)) \cong F(d).$$ 

This implies the weak form by applying the functor $\hom(I, -): V \to Set$. 

### Density form

If $V$ is also (small-)cocomplete, there is an equivalent dual formulation of the enriched Yondeda lemma as a $V$-[[natural isomorphism]]
$$\int^c \hom_C(c,d) \otimes F(c) \cong F(d)$$
induced by the morphisms
$$\hom_C(c,d) \otimes F(c) \to F(d)$$
adjoint to $F_{c,d}$.
This version is sometimes called the **density theorem** and sometimes simply called the enriched Yoneda lemma.

### Dual forms

For an [[enriched presheaf]] $H: C^{op} \to V$ there are dual forms obtained by replacing $C$ above with $C^{op}$.
These are
$$ \int_c V(\hom_C(c,d),H(c)) \cong H(d) $$
and
$$ \int^c \hom_C(d,c) \otimes H(c) \cong H(d). $$
