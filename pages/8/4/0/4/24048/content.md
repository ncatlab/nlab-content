## Definition

An object $P$ of a [[category]] $C$ is a __compact projective object__
if its [[corepresentable functor]] $Hom(P,-)\colon C\to Set$ preserves all small [[sifted colimits]].

Equivalently, it is an object that is a [[compact object]] ($Hom(P,-)$ preserves all small [[filtered colimits]]) and a [[projective object]] ($Hom(P,-)$ preserves epimorphisms, which follows from its preservation of [[coequalizers]]).

## Examples

In the category of algebras over an [[algebraic theory]],
compact projective objects are [[retracts]] of free algebras.

Conversely, if a [[locally small category]] has enough compact projective objects
(meaning that there is a set of compact projective objects that
generates it under small [[colimits]] and reflects isomorphisms),
then this category is equivalent to the category of algebras over an [[algebraic theory]].
Such a category is also known as a [[locally strongly finitely presentable category]]
