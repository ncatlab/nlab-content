## Idea

Prelattices are lattices which do not satisfy [[antisymmetry]]. Or equivalently, they are the bicartesian monoidal preorders, [[thin]] [[cartesian monoidal categories]] which are also [[cocartesian monoidal categories]]. 

Examples of prelattices include [[Heyting prealgebras]]. 

In the same way as lattices, one could either assume that prelattices have top and bottom elements, in which those without top and bottom elements are **pseudoprelattices**, or prelattices do not have top and bottom elements, in which those with top and bottom elements are **bounded prelattices**. Pseudoprelattices are important because every [[ordered Artinian local ring|ordered Artinian local $\mathbb{R}$-algebra]] without [[infinite elements]], found in some approaches to [[analysis]], is a pseudoprelattice.
