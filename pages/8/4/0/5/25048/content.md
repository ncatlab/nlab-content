## Idea

Prelattices are lattices which do not satisfy [[antisymmetry]]. Or equivalently, they are the bicartesian monoidal preorders, [[thin]] [[cartesian monoidal categories]] which are also [[cocartesian monoidal categories]]. 

One example of prelattices include [[Heyting prealgebras]]. Two other examples are the [[integers]] $\mathbb{Z}$ and the [[polynomial ring]] $K[x]$ of a [[discrete field]] $K$, with respect to the divisibility [[preorder]] $a \vert b$, the [[greatest common divisor]] $\gcd$, and the [[least common multiple]] $\lcm$; unlike the natural numbers, these only form a prelattice because there are more than one element in the [[group of units]] of both $\mathbb{Z}$ and $K[x]$, where $\mathbb{Z}^\times \coloneqq \{1, -1\}$ and $K[x]^\times \coloneqq K^\times$. 

In the same way as lattices, one could either assume that prelattices have top and bottom elements, in which those without top and bottom elements are **pseudoprelattices**, or prelattices do not have top and bottom elements, in which those with top and bottom elements are **bounded prelattices**. Pseudoprelattices are important because given any ordered field $K$ with [[pseudolattice]] structure, every [[ordered Artinian local ring|ordered Artinian local $K$-algebra]], found in some approaches to [[analysis]], is a pseudoprelattice.
