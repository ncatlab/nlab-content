## Definition

The [[category]] $TopMfd$ is that whose

* [[object]]s are [[topological manifold]]s;

* [[morphism]]s are [[continuous function]]s between these.

## Properties

### As a site

The category $TopMfd$ becomes a [[large site]] equipped with the [[open cover]] [[coverage]]. This is a [[small-generated site]]: a [[dense sub-site]] is [[CartSp]]${}_{top}$.

The [[hypercompletion|hypercompleted]] [[(∞,1)-sheaf (∞,1)-topos]] over $TopMfd$ is that of [[Euclidean-topological ∞-groupoid]]s. 

$$
  ETop\infty Grpd \simeq \hat Sh_{(\infty,1)}(TopMfd)
  \,.
