I am a PhD student at the Max-Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn under the supervision of [[Markus Hausmann]]. Previously, I've studied at the University of Bonn, the University of Minnesota and the Technical University of Munich.

My research interests include [[higher category theory]] and [[equivariant stable homotopy theory]]. 

Pursuing ([[higher category theory|higher]]) [[category theory]] and [[homotopy theory]].
