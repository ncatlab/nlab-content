I am a PhD student at the Max-Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn under the supervision of Markus Hausmann. Previously, I've studied at the University of Bonn, the University of Minnesota and the Technical University of Munich.

My research interests include higher category theory and equivariant stable homotopy theory. 

Pursuing ([[higher category theory|higher]]) [[category theory]] and [[homotopy theory]].
