I am a PhD student at the Max-Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn under the supervision of [[Markus Hausmann]]. Previously, I've studied at the University of Bonn, the University of Minnesota and the Technical University of Munich.

My research interests include structured ring spectra and structured orientations, particularly in the equivariant setting.
