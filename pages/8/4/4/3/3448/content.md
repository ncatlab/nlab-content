## Idea

Recall that a [[locally constant sheaf]] (of sets) is a section of the [[constant stack]] with fiver the [[groupoid]] $Core(FinSet)$, the [[core]] of the [[category]] [[FinSet]].

This extends to a general pattern:

a **locally constant $\infty$-stack** is a section of the [[constant ∞-stack]] that is constant on the [[∞-groupoid]] $Core(Fin\infty Grpd)$.

## Applications

Locally constant $\infty$-stacks detect the [[monodromy]] of the [[site]] they are living on. This gives rise to a geometric notion of [[homotopy group (of an ∞-stack)]].
