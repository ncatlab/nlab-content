##Idea and definition##
A polyhedron is a space made up of very simple bits 'glued' together. The 'bits' are **simplices** of different dimensions. An abstract simplicial complex is a neat combinatorial way of giving the corresponding 'gluing' instructions, a bit like to plan of a construction kit!

+--{: .un_defn}
######Definition#######
A _simplicial complex_ $K$ is a set of objects, $V(K)$, called **vertices** and a set, $S(K)$, of finite non-empty subsets of $V(K)$, called **[[simplex|simplices]]**.  The simplices satisfy the condition that if $\sigma \subset V(K)$ is a simplex and $\tau \subset \sigma$, $\tau \ne \emptyset$, then $\tau$ is also a simplex.  
=--
We say $\tau$ is a **face** of $\sigma$.  If $\sigma \in S(K)$ has $p+1$ elements it is said to be a **$p$-simplex**.  The set of $p$-simplices of $K$ is denoted by $K_p$. The **dimension** of $K$ is the largest $p$ such that $K_p$ is non-empty.

##Examples##
1. Any (undirected simple) graph gives a simplicial complex. The usual definition of graph is that it is an ordered pair $(V,E)$ where $V$ is a set of vertices, and $E$ a set of (unordered) pairs of vertices. This is the simplest form of graph; it is undirected, edges do not have a 'start' and 'finish', (or 'head' and 'tail') and 'simple', in as much as there can be at most one edge between a given pair of vertices. (The case of a 'multigraph' where there can be multiple edges between vertices, and perhaps loops at a vertex, does not correspond to a simplicial complex, but does give a [[simplicial set]].)  A graph is a 1-dimensional simplicial complex.

1. Given a space and an [[open cover]], the nerve of the cover is a simplicial complex (see [[Čech methods]] and the discussion there). The [[Vietoris complex]] is another given by a related method.

1. Given any two sets $X$ and $Y$, and a relation $R\subseteq X\times Y$, there are two simplicial complexes that encode information on the relation. These are generalisations of the nerve and the Vietoris complex. They are studied in detail in [[Dowker's theorem]].

1.  If $(P,\leq)$ is a [[poset]], then the [[nerve]] of the associated category has a simple description. The vertices are the points of $P$ and the simplices are the [[flag|flags]].


1. **Buildings:**
An important class of simplicial complexes is provided by the notion of [[building]], due to Jacques Tits.  


##Simplicial complexes v. simplicial sets {#vsSSet}

Simplicial complexes are, in some sense, special cases of [[simplicial set|simplicial sets]], but only 'in some sense'. To get from a simplicial complex to a fairly small simplicial set, you  pick a [[total order]] on the set of vertices. Without an order on the vertices, you cannot speak of the $k^{th}$ face of a simplex, which is an essential feature of a simplicial set! The degeneracies are obtained by repeating an element when listing the vertices of a simplex. If $\sigma = \{v_0,v_1,\ldots, v_n\}$, with $v_0\lt v_1\lt \ldots \lt v_n$ then, for instance, $s_0(\sigma) = \{v_0,v_0, v_1,\ldots, v_n\}$. (If you do not pick an order then you can still form a simplicial set where to each $n$-simplex of the original simplicial complex will correspond to $(n+1)!$ simplices of that associated simplicial set. The result is unwealdy to say the least, but can be useful under some circumstances.)

##Simplicial complexes as sheaves on a site##
Simplicial sets are essentially (that is, up to equivalence) [[presheaves]] on the [[simplex category]] of finite nonempty totally ordered sets, whereas simplicial complexes may be regarded as certain types of presheaves on the category $Fin_{inj}$ of finite nonempty sets and injections between them. This works as follows: given a simplicial complex, $K = (V(K), S(K))$, define a presheaf $K^\sim: Fin_{inj}^{op} \to Set$ whose values are sets of injections $\phi$: 

$$K^\sim(B) \stackrel{def}{=} \{\phi: B \hookrightarrow V(K)| \phi(B) \in S(K)\}, \qquad K^\sim(i: A \to B)(\phi) \stackrel{def}{=} \phi \circ i$$ 

This defines an evident [[functor]] 

$$SimpComplex \to Set^{Fin_{inj}^{op}}: K \mapsto K^\sim$$ 

that is [[full and faithful functor|full and faithful]]. In fact, following a suggestion of James Dolan, Baez and Hoffnung characterize the category of simplicial complexes up to equivalence as the full subcategory of [[concrete sheaf|concrete sheaves]] on $Fin_{inj}$ with respect to the trivial [[Grothendieck topology|topology]] (where the only covering sieve $F \hookrightarrow hom(-, D)$ is the maximal sieve). 

It follows from this characterization that the category of simplicial complexes is a [[quasitopos]], and in particular is locally cartesian closed. The category of simplicial sets on the other hand is a [[topos]]. 

##Geometric realisations and Polyhedra##
An abstract simplicial complex is a combinatorial gadget that models certain aspects of a spatial configuration.  Sometimes it is useful, perhaps even necessary, to produce a topological space from that data in a simplicial complex. 

### Idea
To each simplicial complex $K$, one can associate a topological space called the _polyhedron_ of $K$ often also called the  _geometric realisation_ of $K$ and denoted $|K|$.   (This is essentially a special case of the geometric realisation of a simplicial sets.)


This can be constructed by taking a copy $K(\sigma)$ of a standard topological $p$-simplex for each $p$-simplex of $K$ and then 'gluing' them together according to the face relations encoded in $K$.

We therefore first need the definition of a standard $p$-simplex
+--{: .un_defn}
######Definition######
The _standard (topological) $p$-simplex_ is (usually)  taken to be the convex hull of the basis vectors $\mathbf{e}_1, \mathbf{e}_2,\ldots, \mathbf{e}_{p+1}$ in $\mathbb{R}^{p+1}$.
=--

###Intuition
The geometric realisation $|K|$ of a simplicial complex, $K$  is then constructed by taking, for each abstract $p$-simplex, $\sigma\in S(K)$, a copy, $K(\sigma)$ of such a standard topological $p$-simplex, and then 'gluing' faces together, so whenever $\tau$ is a face of $\sigma$ we identify $K(\tau)$ with the corresponding face of $K(\sigma)$. This space is usually denoted $\Delta^p$.

###Canonical construction

As a set, $|K|$ is constructed as follows: 

$|K|$ is the set of all functions from $V(K)$ to  the closed interval $[0,1]$ such that

* if $\alpha \in |K|$, the set
 
$$\{v \in V(K) \mid \alpha(v)  \neq  0\}$$

is a simplex of $K$;

 * for each $v\in V(K)$,  
$$\sum_{\alpha \in V(K)} \alpha (v) = 1.$$

There are two commonly used topologies on the set $|K|$. The first is the _metric topology_: we put a metric $d$ on $|K|$ by 

$$d(\alpha,\beta) = \Big(\sum_{v\in V(K)} (\alpha(v) - \beta(v))^2\Big)^\frac{1}{2}.$$

$|K|$, when endowed with the metric space topology, will be denoted $|K|_d$. Notice that when $V(K)$ is finite, this gives $|K|_d$ as a subspace of the metric space $\mathbb{R}^{\#(V(K))}$ (which is usually of much higher dimension than might seem geometrically significant in a given context). 

The second topology is the _coherent topology_: each geometric simplex $|s|$ consists of all $\alpha \in |K|$ supported in $s$, and is given the subspace topology inherited as a subset of $|K|_d$; then the coherent topology on $|K|$ is the largest topology for which all inclusions $|s| \hookrightarrow |K|$ are continuous. This topological space is normally denoted just $|K|$, reflecting the fact that the coherent topology is regarded as the default topology to put on the set $|K|$. 

Note that if $s \subseteq t$ is an inclusion of simplices in $K$, then there is an induced subspace inclusion $|s| \hookrightarrow |t|$. The space $|K|$ may then be characterized as the colimit in $Top$ of the diagram consisting of geometric simplices $|s|$ and inclusions between them, so that a function $f: |K| \to X$ is continuous if and only if its restriction to each simplex $|s|$ is continuous. In particular, the identity function $|K| \to |K|_d$ is continuous, so that the coherent topology contains the metric topology (and is often strictly larger). 

* **Warning:** The geometric realization of a simplicial complex does not preserve products. Indeed, the product of two intervals in the category of simplicial complexes is the tetrahedron! 

## Triangulable spaces

If a topological space can be described up to homeomorphism as the geometric realization of a simplicial complex, we say it is **triangulable**, and a **triangulation** of a space $X$ is a simplicial complex $K$ together with a homeomorphism $h: |K| \to X$. (This is discussed in a bit more detail in the entry on [[classical triangulation]]. 

There is another stronger notion of triangulation used by geometric topologists: a **piecewise-linear (PL) structure** on a space $X$ is a triangulation where the link of every simplex in $K$ is a PL triangulation of a sphere. 

+--{.query} 
This is as best as I can make out from reading Wikipedia. The definition looks recursive. Obviously I haven't filled in the definition of link.

#### Examples from manifold theory

* All [[manifold|smooth manifolds]] are triangulable and,  in fact, admit PL structures. 

* All topological manifolds in dimensions 2 and 3 admit PL structures, and are in fact smoothable (admit a smooth manifold structure). 

* The $E_8$ [[E8 manifold|manifold]] does not admit a triangulation, much less a PL structure. 

* In dimensions $n \geq 5$, the $(n-2)$-fold suspension of the [[Poincaré sphere]] is homeomorphic to the $n$-sphere, hence is triangulable, but it does not admit a PL structure. 

#### Relation to simplicial sets

The following statement may seem obvious, but it requires careful proof: 

* A space is triangulable if and only if it is homeomorphic to the geometric realization of a simplicial set. 

As an important step: 

* The geometric realization of the nerve of a poset is triangulable. 

(These statements should actually be treated as conjectures for the moment until I write out careful proofs. The basic technique is subdivision.)
