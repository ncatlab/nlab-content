## Idea

The Butcher group was introduced in Butcher’s seminal work on [[Runge-Kutta method]]s. The elements of the group are (generalised) numerical schemes which contain the Runge-Kutta schemes and the group product encodes composition of numerical schemes.

Later Brouder observed that the Butcher group can be viewed as the character group of the (Butcher-)Connes-Kreimer-Hopf algebra used in the combinatorial approach to renormalisation.

## Properties

The group is used in numerical analysis to deal with order conditions of numerical methods. Further, it has been discovered that the Butcher group is an [[infinite-dimensional Lie group]].
