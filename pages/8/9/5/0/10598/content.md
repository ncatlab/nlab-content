## Idea

The concept of _$G$-CW  complex_ is to that of [[CW-complexes]] as [[topological G-spaces]] are to [[topological spaces]]: for $G$ a [[compact topological group]], the notion of _$G$-CW-complex_ is much like that of [[CW-complex]], only that where in the latter case one builds a [[topological space]] from gluing of [[disks]] $D^n$ ("[[cell complex|cells]]") for a $G$-CW-complex one glues [[products]] of [[disks]] with $G$-[[orbits]] $G/H$ ([[coset spaces]]) for [[compact Lie group|compact]] [[subgroups]] $H$.

These are cofibrant spaces used in $G$-[[equivariant homotopy theory]].

## Examples

### Smooth $G$-manifolds

If a [[compact Lie group]] $G$ acts on a [[compact topological space|compact]] [[smooth manifold]] $X$, then the manifold admits an equivariant triangulation. In particular it has the structure of a G-CW complex. 

([Illman 83, theorem 7.1, corollary 7.2](#Illman83)) Recalled as ([ALR 07, theorem 3.2](#ALR07)). See also [Waner 80, p. 6](#Waner80) who attributes this to [Matumoto 71](#Matumoto71)

Moreover, if the manifold does have a [[manifold with boundary|boundary]], then its G-CW complex may be chosen such that the boundary is a G-subcomplex. ([Illman 83, last sentence above theorem 7.1](#Illman83))


## Properties

### Elmendorf's theorem

The collection of $G$-CW-complexes has a [[full sub-(infinity,1)-category|full embedding]] into the [[(infinity,1)-presheaves]] on the [[orbit category]] $Orb(G)$.  This is given by sending a $G$-CW complex, $Y$, to the presheaf sending $G/H$ to $Y^H$, the subspace of $Y$ fixed by $H$.
