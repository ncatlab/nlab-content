A __$\tau$-locally affine space__ is a [[sheaf]] of [[rings]] on the category $Aff$ ([[affine scheme]]s) opposite to the category of commutative unital rings in some subcanonical [[Grothendieck topology]] $\tau$. If $\tau$ is the [[Zariski topology]], then $\tau$-locally affine spaces are [[schemes]]. Other examples are sheaves in fppf, fpqc, &#233;tale or lisse (=smooth) topology. The relative version uses the category of relative affine schemes $Aff/X$ which is, in the case of $X=Spec(A)$ where $A$ is a commutative ring, simply the opposite of the category of $A$-algebras.

In [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]], one can consider $NAff$, that is the opposite to the category of all unital associative rings instead of $Aff$. There is a noncommutative smooth topology on $NAff$ (M. Konstevich, A. L. Rosenberg, _Noncommutative smooth spaces_, [arXiv:math/9812158](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/9812158)), which is a genuine Grothendieck topology. On the other hand, one can not obtain a Grothendieck topology using exact affine lcoalizations: the stability axiom of Grothendieck topologies fails. However some other generalizations of topologies on $NAff$ are available for the noncommutative case (e.g. [[Q-categories]] and "quasi-topologies" of Rosenberg) or one can instead of working with sheaves on the big site $NAff$ work with noncommutative generalization of small cotopologies on rings (cf. work of van Oystaeyen on "noncommutative topologies").
