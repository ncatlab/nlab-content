__Noncommutative algebraic geometry__   is the study of 'spaces' represented by algebras, or categories. It extends the algebraic geometric methods (local rings, intersection theory etc.) to study noncommutative algebras, and conversely, uses noncommutative algebras in the study of commutative algebraic varieties (Brauer groups, noncommutative desingularizations, stacks etc.). Unlike in Connes' style [[noncommutative geometry]], the algebras in question are ordinary associative unital $k$-algebras, possibly with grading, but without topology. Categories are typically abelian, triangulated, dg-categories or $A_\infty$-categories, and they are viewed as categories of (complexes of) coherent or quasicoherent sheaves on a noncommutative algebraic scheme or a generalization.

The subject is older than mainstream noncommutative geometry and it is very much implicit in Pierre Gabriel's thesis "Des cat&#233;gories Ab&#233;liennes" (Bull. Soc. Math. France 1962). The Gabriel [[spectrum (geometry)|spectrum]] (consisting of injective indecomposables) amounts to a reconstruction of a quasiseparated quasicompact scheme from its category of quasicoherent $\mathcal{O}$-modules (now generalized to all schemes, as the Gabriel-Rosenberg theorem). He looked at localization functors, and corresponding subcategories (reflective and coreflective), and proved some theorems on localization of quasicoherent sheaves. At the same time, Grothendieck taught us that _to study a space it is enough to have a category of sheaves on this would-be space_. 

Together with two Auslander-Goldman papers "Maximal orders" and "The Brauer group of a commutative ring", both in Trans. AMS 1960 Gabriel's paper is a precursor of a more articulated development starting with Mike Artin's "On Azumaya algebras and finte dimensional representations of rings" (J. Alg. 1969). Artin's 1969 paper characterizes [[Azumaya algebra]]s via their identities and paved the way to generalize algebraic geometry to rings satisfying polynomial identities, via their representations and invariant theory. Subsequent major contributions were made by Claudio Procesi with his book "Rings with polynomial identities" (Marcel Dekker 1973) and his paper "The invariant theory of $n\times n$ matrices" (Adv. Math. 1976) and by Mike Artin and Bill Schelter's "A version of Zariski's main theorem for PI rings" (Amer. J. Math. 1979). The link with representation theory, using seminal work by Paul Cohn and George Bergman, was clarified by Claus Ringel "The simple Artinian spectrum of a finite dimensional algebra" (in Dekker Lect. Notes 51, 1979) and culminated in Aidan Schofield's book "Representations of rings over skew fields" (1985). These developments have been influential for recent work in 'formal' noncommutative geometry, such as Maxim Kontsevich "Formal (non)commutative symplectic geometry" (1993), Joachim Cuntz and Daniel Quillen's "Algebra extensions and nonsingularity" (JAMS 1995), "Noncommutative smooth spaces" by M. Kontsevich and A. L. Rosenberg (Gelfand smeinar, arXiv 1998) (see [[quasi-free algebra]]). 

In the 70ties, localization theory was popular among ring theorists, and, several people tried to generalize structure sheaves to noncommutative algebras. Gabriel-like localizations via alternative formalism of "kernel functors" (Goldman 1969) led to the books by Jonathan Golan "Localization of noncommutative rings" (Marcel Dekker 1975) and Fred Van Oystaeyen "Prime spectra in noncommutative algebra" (Springer LNM 444, 1975), and making the link with the Artin-Procesi approach, the book by Fred Van Oystaeyen and Alain Verschoren "Non-commutative algebraic geometry" (Springer LNM 887, 1981). Localizations were viewed as analogues of open sets. However, the lattice of torsion theories is not distributive, what presented major difficulties at the time. Around 1995, a major [[descent]] theorem was proved by van Oystaeyen and Willaert and independently in a work of A. Rosenberg in Stockholm (1988). It is sort of generalized sheaf condition for quasicoherent modules, with respect to covers by Gabriel localizations. 

Cohn's universal localizations were used by Paul Cohn in "The affine scheme of a general ring" (in Springer LNM 753, 1979) and later by Claus Ringel and Aidan Schofield as mentioned before. In England, Goldie's localization theory led to the theory of 'cliques' and 'clans' of prime ideals (Jategaonkar, Hajarnavis and others) which may in retrospect be viewed as influential to present local description via quivers and A-infinity structures.

Around 1980, the Leningrad school of integrable systems (Sklyanin, Fadeev, Takhtajan) created examples of [[quantum groups]], and soon after that were joined by Drinfel'd, Novikov, Jimbo, and independently, Manin and Woronowicz; these in turn give good examples in __affine noncommutative geometry__ (spaces represented by a single nongraded ring), moreover the actions of group-like objects are considered starting the subject of [[equivariant noncommutative algebraic geometry]].

In the early 80ties maximal orders were revisited as noncommutative versions of normal varieties. In particular their local structure was investigated. Extending prior work by Mark Ramras, Mike Artin succeeded in describing the etale local structure of maximal orders over surfaces. In trying to generalize this to higher dimensions, one was quickly led to impose strong homological properties on the orders (and later, more general algebras). This led to the investigation of homological homogeneous rings (work by Ken Brown and others), Artin-Schelter regular algebras and, finally, Auslander-regular rings.
In this vain, around 1989, __noncommutative projective geometry__ was developed by Artin, Zhang and collaborators, where Serre's theorem on Proj of a graded ring is taken as a definition in the noncommutative case: quasicoherent sheaves over a Proj of a graded ring is the category of graded modules modulo the modules of finite length. They assume strong regularity properties on graded rings, limiting to the geometry which is very close to commutative projective geometry. Using [[Ore localization]] van Oystaeyen has defined another version of noncommutative projective geometry, based on his notion of [[schematic algebra]].

A huge project started, trying to classify Auslander-regular algebras, graded-connected and generated in degree one (that is, noncommutative analogons of projective n-space) for small dimensions n. In dimension 3, the initial work was done by Artin and Schelter, culminating in the influential papers ATV1 and ATV2 (ATV for Mike Artin, John Tate and Michel Van den Bergh, ATV1 in Grothendieck Festschrift 1990, ATV2 in Invent. Math 1991). In this classification a class of algebras re-appeared which were initially discovered by Odeskii and Feigin, the so called Sklyanin algebras. Ring-theoretic investigations of the Sklyanin algebras were done by Tate and Van den Bergh (Noetherianity for all dimensions n) and in dimension 4 a geometric study via 'point' and 'line' modules was carried out by Thierry Levasseur, Toby Stafford and Paul Smith. Further classifications in dimension 3 (dropping the degree one generator condition) and 4 were done by these people and their students. In the ungraded case, maximal orders with excellent homological properties were recently used in connection with quotient-singularities and their desingularizations as in the noncommutative crepant resolution by Michel Van den Bergh (Abel symposium 2002).

Lieven Le Bruyn to the Lab-elves : what follows is part of the original text by Zoran Skoda based on his association with  Alex Rosenberg. I've tried to include the major developments above with precise references. I don't understand the Van Oystaeyen-Willaert vs. Rosenberg part nor the Le Bruyn (that is,me) vs. Laudal part. But, feel free to edit in any way you feel like.

Zoran &#352;koda: my (very unfinished and criticised before any level of completion beyond quick initial start) entry is not at all based on any association, but rather on much more general viewpoint on noncommutative geometry including not only ring-theoretic aspect but also the categorical aspect on the line GABRIEL-Manin-Rosenberg in abelian and Kapranov-Bondal-Orlov-van den Bergh-Kontsevich in triangulated, dg and A-infinity setup. My emphasis was more on concepts, and categorical viewpoint, than on listing all references (history entry should be separately and welcome). For example, in the addition above casually is mixed graded and nongraded setup: nlab regulars should be warned about points of entry and motivation of affine and proijective geometries. On the other hand, I am not competent enough to write extensively on the very developed, but for category theorists rather special case of slightly noncommutative projective geometry of line Artin-Schelter-Tate-Zhang-Smith though intend to do part of this in specialized entries (one of the reasons why I listed ALL papers in [[Grothendieck Festschrift]] was that interest in Artin's work; last week I went to integrable systems conference partly because of interest in elliptic algebras which belong to the class from this paper; Le Bruyn should notice that I was long time ago passworded member of his web chat group on his style of ncg which to my regret was not very active). I placed some of the stuff from below into the text above to make it all-inclusive without disposing any material except the repetitions of facts. Much more is missing here, for example algebraic K-theory for nc rings and cyclic homology etc.

Regarding that in noncommutative case classical spectra from ring theory (like primitive spectrum and Gbariel's spectrum are usually to small to represent noncommutative spaces) A. L. Rosenberg has developed many spectral constructions extending from the left spectrum of a ring to various spectra of abelian categories, triangulated categories and right exact categories (in his sense) and created a categorical version of a notion of (quasicompact relative) [[noncommutative scheme]] $X$ over a base category $C$ (viewed as category of sheaves on $Spec k$).

[Homological mirror symmetry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homological_mirror_symmetry) by M. Kontsevich is a source of 
lots of examples of spaces of derived algebraic geometry, which are represented by triangulated categories or their
dg- or $A_\infty$-enhancements; this has been enhanced by the insight in the structure of derived categories of coherent sheaves and their deformations like Landau-Ginzburg models, by [Beilinson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Beilinson)(1977/8), Kapranov (1985-), Orlov, Bondal, van den Bergh, Polishchuk, Bridgeland and others.  Another big source of example is deformation quantization and related topics involving usage of $A_\infty$ and $L_\infty$-algebras. Understanding of the role of quivers in noncommutative geometry has also being stimulated by independent and original works of Lieven le Bruyn and Arfinn Laudal, where the latter has also being motivated by deformation theory.  

Derived noncommutative geometry is related subject to the commutative [[derived algebraic geometry]] of C. Simpson's school. Cyclic and [[Hochschild homology]] play a major role. The most nontrivial result seem to be a noncommutative version of the degeneration of Hodge-to-de Rham [[spectral sequence]], conjectured by Kontsevich and in one version [proved](http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/0611.5623) by D. Kaledin.
