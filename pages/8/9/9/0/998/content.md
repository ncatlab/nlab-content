__Noncommutative algebraic geometry__  extends algebraic geometric methods (local rings, intersection theory etc.) to study noncommutative algebras, and conversely, uses noncommutative algebras in the study of commutative algebraic varieties (Brauer groups, noncommutative desingularizations, stacks etc.).

Arguably, the first genuine NAG-paper was Mike Artin's "On Azumaya algebras and finte dimensional representations of rings" (J. Alg. 1969), but there are precursors which turned out to be influential in later developments : the two Auslander-Goldman papers "Maximal orders" and "The Brauer group of a commutative ring", both in Trans. AMS 1960, and, Pierre Gabriel's foundational paper "Des categories Abeliennes" (Bull. Soc. Math. France 1962).

Artin's 1969 paper characterizes Azumaya algebras via their identities and paved the way to generalize algebraic geometry to rings satisfying polynomial identities, via their representations and invariant theory. Subsequent major contributions were made by Claudia Procesi with his book "Rings with polynomial identities" (Marcel Dekker 1973) and his paper "The invariant theory of n x n matrices" (Adv. Math. 1976) and by Mike Artin and Bill Schelter's "A version of Zariski's main theorem for PI rings" (Amer. J. Math. 1979). The link with representation theory, using seminal work by Paul Cohn and George Bergman, was clarified by Claus Ringel "The simple Artinian spectrum of a finite dimensional algebra" (in Dekker Lect. Notes 51, 1979) and culminated in Aidan Schofield's book "Representations of rings over skew fields" (1985). These developments have been influencial for recent work in 'formal' noncommutative geometry, such as Maxim Kontsevich "Formal (non)commutative symplectic geometry" (1993), Joachim Cuntz and Daniel Quillen's "Algebra extensions and nonsingularity" (JAMS 1995), "Noncommutative smooth spaces" by Kontsevich and Alex Rosenberg (arXiv 1998).


In the 70ties, localization theory was popular among ringtheorists, and, several people tried to generalize structure sheaves to noncommutative algebras. Gabriel-like localizations via kernel functors led to the books by Jonathan Golan "Localization of noncommutative rings" (Marcel Dekker 1975) and Fred Van Oystaeyen "Prime spectra in noncommutative algebra" (Springer LNM 444, 1975), and making the link with the Artin-Procesi approach, the book by Fred Van Oystaeyen and Alain Verschoren "Non-commutative algebraic geometry" (Springer LNM 887, 1981). Universal localizations were used by Paul Cohn in "The affine scheme of a general ring" (in Springer LNM 753, 1979) and later by Claus Ringel and Aidan Schofield as mentioned before. In England, Goldie's localization theory led to the theory of 'cliques' and 'clans' of prime ideals (work by Jategaonkar, Hajarnavis and others) which may in retrospect be viewed as influential to present local description via quivers and A-infinity structures.


In the early 80ties maximal orders were revisited as noncommutative versions of normal varieties. In particular their local structure was investigated. Extending prior work by Mark Ramras, Mike Artin succeeded in describing the etale local structure of maximal orders over surfaces. In trying to generalize this to higher dimensions, one was quickly led to impose strong homological properties on the orders (and later, more general algebras). This led to the investigation of homological homogeneous rings (work by Ken Brown and others), Artin-Schelter regular algebras and, finally, Auslander-regular rings.

A huge project started, trying to classify Auslander-regular algebras, graded-connected and generated in degree one (that is, noncommutative analogons of projective n-space) for small dimensions n. In dimension 3, the initial work was done by Artin and Schelter, culminating in the influential papers ATV1 and ATV2 (ATV for Mike Artin, John Tate and Michel Van den Bergh, ATV1 in Grothendieck Festschrift 1990, ATV2 in Invent. Math 1991). In this classification a class of algebras re-appeared which were initially discovered by Odeskii and Feigin, the so called Sklyanin algebras. Ringtheoretic investigations of the Sklyanin algebras were done by Tate and Van den Bergh (Noetherianity for all dimensions n) and in dimension 4 a geometric study via 'point' and 'line' modules was carried out by Thierry levasseur, Toby Stafford and Paul Smith. Further classifications in dimension 3 (dropping the degree one generator condition) and 4 were done by these people and their students. In the ungraded case, maximal orders with excellent homological properties were recently used in connection with quotient-singularities and their desingularizations as in the noncommutative crepant resolution by Michel Van den Bergh (Abel symposium 2002).

The use of categories in NAG has increased in recent years. First, in the definition of the proj of a graded ring as the quotient category of all graded modules by the finite length modules. Next, in the 'derived' geometry, originally developed by Bondal and Orlov, and generalized to the noncommutative case by Bondal and Van den Bergh in "Generators and representability of functors in commutative and noncommutative geometry" Moscow MJ 2003, and then, in deformation quantization and related topics.

Lieven Le Bruyn to the Lab-elves : what follows is part of the original text by Zoran Skoda based on his association with  Alex Rosenberg. I've tried to include the major developments above with precise references. I don't understand the Van Oystaeyen-Willaert vs. Rosenberg part nor the Le Bruyn (that is,me) vs. Laudal part. But, feel free to edit in any way you feel like.

The subject is older than differential noncommutative geometry and it is very much implicit in Gabriel's thesis on nonabelian categories, published in 1960/1961. Gabriel introduced the Gabriel [[spectrum (geometry)|spectrum]] (consisting of injective indecomposables) which reconstructs a quasiseparated quasicompact scheme from its category of quasicoherent modules (now generalized to all schemes, as the Gabriel-Rosenberg theorem). He looked at localization functors, and corresponding subcategories (reflective and coreflective), and proved some theorems on localization of quasicoherent sheaves. At the same time, Grothendieck taught us that to study a space it is enough to have a category of sheaves on this would-be space. 

Several years later P.M. Cohn studied a prime spectrum of a ring.

Localization theory was taken more seriously around 1974--1976
when Golan and van Oystaeyen made a serious study of rings, with geometric picture in mind. Localizations were viewed as analogues of open sets. However, the lattice of torsion theories is not distributive, something which presented major difficulties at the time. Around 1995, a major descent theorem was proved by van Oystaeyen and Willaert and independently in a work of A. Rosenberg in Stockholm (1988). It is sort of generalized sheaf condition for quasicoherent modules, with respect to covers by Gabriel localizations. 

Around 1980, the Leningrad school of integrable systems (Sklyanin, Fadeev, Takhtajan) created examples of quantum groups, and soon after that were joined by Drinfeld, Novikov, and independently, Manin and Woronowicz; these in turn give good examples in affine noncommutative geometry. 

Around 1989, _noncommutative projective geometry_ was developed by Artin, Zhang and collaborators, where Serre's theorem on Proj of a graded ring is taken as a definition in the noncommutative case: quasicoherent sheaves over a Proj of a graded ring is the category of graded modules modulo the modules of finite length. They assume strong regularity properties on graded rings, limiting to the geometry which is very close to commutative projective geometry. Using [[Ore localization]] van Oystaeyen has defined another version of noncommutative projective geometry, based on a notion of schematic algebra. 

A. L. Rosenberg has developed many spectral constructions 
extending from rings to abelian categories, triangulated 
categories and right exact categories (in his sense). He has also created a categorical version of a notion of noncommutative scheme, used implicitly earlier, but published in 1998. 

[Homological mirror symmetry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homological_mirror_symmetry) by M. Kontsevich is a source of 
lots of examples of spaces of derived algebraic geometry, which are represented by triangulated categories or their
dg- or $A_\infty$-enhancements; this has been enhanced by the insight in the structure of derived categories of coherent sheaves and their deformations like Landau-Ginzburg models, by Kapranov, Orlov, Bondal, van den Bergh, Polishchuk, Bridgeland and others.
Understanding of the role of quivers in noncommutative geometry has also being stimulated by independent and original works of Lieven le Bruyn and Arfinn Laudal. 

Derived noncommutative geometry is related subject to the commutative [[derived algebraic geometry]] of C. Simpson's school. Cyclic and [[Hochschild homology]] play a major role. The most nontrivial result seem to be noncommutative version of degeneration of Hodge-to-de Rham [[spectral sequence]], conjectured by Kontsevich and in one version [proved](http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/0611.5623) by D. Kaledin.
