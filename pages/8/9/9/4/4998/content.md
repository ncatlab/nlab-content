## Definitions

(For the moment, mostly as an example of a [[coalgebra for an endofunctor]] and to start discussion of models for non-determinism.)

This will give the classical definition as a non-deterministic state-based system and then show how to turn that form into the coalgebraic form.

######Definition

A **non-deterministic [[automaton]]** consists of the following data:
 
* a [[set]] of _states_, $Q$;

* a set, $\Sigma$, of _input symbols_ ;

* a function, $\delta : Q\times \Sigma \to \mathcal{P}(Q)$, called the _next state relation_,

and

* a [[predicate]], $final : Q \to bool = \{\bot, \top\}$, the [[boolean domain]].
=--

In the usual interpretation if the automaton is in state $q$, and is 'given' the input $\sigma$, then it changes to being in one of the states in the subset, $\delta(q,\sigma)$, of $Q$.  

The 'final' predicate, of course, returns $\top$ if a state is a _final state_ and $\bot$ otherwise. (There will, in general, be a set of final or 'accept' states.) 

(For the moment we will not look at the links between automata and languages.)


## Properties

### Coalgebraic description

The first step in transforming the above definition to the coalgebraic form is to [[currying|curry]] $\delta$, so as to obtain it in the form $\delta : Q\to \mathcal{P}(Q)^\Sigma$. We thus have for a state, $q\in Q$, $\delta(q,) : \Sigma \to \mathcal{P}(Q)$.  We then also have a product function

$$\alpha = \delta \times (final) : Q \to  \mathcal{P}(Q)^\Sigma\times bool.$$

If we now write $HQ = \mathcal{P}(Q)^\Sigma\times bool$, we get a functor (for you to check) $H : Set \to Set$ and the non-deterministic automaton corresponded precisely to a [[coalgebra for an endofunctor|coalgebra]], $(Q,\alpha)$, for $H$.
