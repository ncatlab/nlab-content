In its most general form, a __representation__ is simply a [[functor]]:  $F\colon C \to D$ is a repersentation of $C$ in $D$.  Similarly, an __intertwiner__ between represtentations is simply a [[natural transformation]] between functors when they are being thought of as representations.

The term 'representation' is most often used when one or more of the following conditions apply:
*  $D$ is the category [[Vect]] of vector spaces; one then has a __linear representation__.
*  $C$ is the [[delooping]] of a [[group]]; one then has a __group representation__ or [[action]].
*  $C$ is the [[free category]] on a [[quiver]]; one then has a __quiver representation__.
