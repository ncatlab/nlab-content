In a rather general form, a __representation__ of category $C$ in category $D$ is simply a [[functor]]:  $F\colon C \to D$.  If $D$ expresses symmetries of some mathematical object $V$, e.f. $D$ is some form of $Aut(V)$, then $V$ is said to be carrier (sometimes space) of the representation and $C$ is said to act on $D$; $F$ is said to be representation of $C$ on $V$. An __intertwiner__ between representations is a [[natural transformation]] between functors when they are being thought of as representations.

The term 'representation' is most often used when one or more of the following conditions apply:
*  $D$ is the category [[Vect]] of vector spaces; one then has a __linear representation__.
*  $C$ is the [[delooping]] of a [[group]]; one then has a __group representation__ in category $D$; moreover category $D$ is usually the delooping of the automorphism group $Aut(V)$ of some structure $V$ (e.g. $V$ is a topological vector space or another group). This is the classical group representation. 
*  $C$ is the [[free category]] on a [[quiver]]; one then has a __quiver representation__.

There are also enriched, $k$-linear and other versions, hence one can talk about representations of Lie algebram, vertex operator algebras etc. See also [[representation theory]].
