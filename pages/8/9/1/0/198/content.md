The concept of 'representation' is very general, but we may define a _representation_ of a [[category]] $C$ to be a [[functor]]

$$F : C \to Vect$$

where [[Vect]] is the category of vector spaces.  This reduces to the usual concept of group representation when $C$ is a [[group]], and the usual concept of quiver representation when $C$ is a [[quiver]].
