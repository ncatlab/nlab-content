It would be great if someone could take the opportunity to explain quantum systems here. Not in the traditional way, but in a category theoretic (or "arrow theoretic" way).

[[Eric]]: Half jokingly, a **quantum system** is an object in the category of quantum systems $QuantumSystem$.

[[Ian Durham]]: Half jokingly, we physicists can't even agree on what constitutes a quantum system.  I say half-jokingly because I recently wrote an essay about how we may have to re-think what we mean by a "quantum system."

[[Eric]]: Do you have a link? I'd be interested in reading it :)
