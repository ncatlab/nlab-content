An orthogonal matrix is a square matrix $A$ satisfying $A^T A = 1$ where $A^T$ is the transpose of $A$.

Orthogonal matrices form a subgroup of the general linear group, namely the [[orthogonal group]].

Over the reals, [[Cayley transform]] is a diffeomorphism between the linear space skewsymmetric matrices and an open subset of the Lie group of orthogonal matrices ($A$ such that $I+A$ is invertible) - a chart which is often having an advantage over using the exponential map. 

For a generalization see [[J-orthogonal matrix]].
