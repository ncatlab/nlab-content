## Of a Lie algebra

The _Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra_ $CE(\mathfrak{g})$ of a finite dimensional [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ is the [[semifree dga|semifree]] graded-commutative [[dg-algebra]] whose underlying graded algebra is the [[Grassmann algebra]] $\wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^*$ and whose [[differential]] $d$ is on $\mathfrak{g}^*$ the dual of the Lie bracket

$$
  d|_{\mathfrak{g}^*} := [-,-]^* : \mathfrak{g}^* \to \mathfrak{g}^* \wedge \mathfrak{g}^*
$$

extended uniquely as a graded [[derivation]] on $\wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^*$.

That this differential indeed squares to 0, $d \circ d = 0$, is precisely the fact that the Lie bracket satisfies the [[Jacobi identity]].


If we choose a dual basis $\{t^a\}$ of $\mathfrak{g}^*$ and let $\{C^a{}_{b c}\}$ be the structure constants of the Lie bracket in that basis, then the action of the differential on the basis generators is

$$
  d t^a = - \frac{1}{2} C^a{}_{b c} t^b \wedge t^c
  \,,
$$

where here and in the following a sum over repeated indices is implicit.

This has a more or less evident generalization to infinite-dimensional Lie algebras.

## Differential algebra and coalgebra

In fact the graded-commutative dg-algebra structures on $\wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^*$ is precisely in bijection with Lie algebra structures on $\mathfrak{g}$: the dual of the restriction of $d$ to $\mathfrak{g}^*$ defines a skew-linear bracket and the condition $d^2 = 0$ holds if and only if that bracket satisfies the Jacobi identity.

Therefore we may identify (finite-dimensional) Lie algebras on a (finite dimensional) vector space $\mathfrak{g}$ with [[semifree dga]]s generated by $\mathfrak{g}^*$. 

There is an analogous statement not involving the dualization: Lie algebra structures on $\mathfrak{g}$ are in bijection with the structure of a _[[differential graded coalgebra]]_ $(\vee^\bullet \mathfrak{g}, D)$ on the free graded-co-commutative coalgebra $\vee^\bullet \mathfrak{g}$ on $\mathfrak{g}$ with $D$ a [[derivation]] of degree -1 squaring to 0.

The relation between the differentials is simply dualization

$$
  (\vee^\bullet \mathfrak{g}, D) \leftrightarrow
  (\wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^* , d )
  \,.
$$

## For $L_\infty$-algebras

This suggests a grand generalization by simply generalizing the [[Grassmann algebra]] over a [[vector space]] $\mathfrak{g}^*$ to the Grassmann algebra over a [[graded vector space]].

If $\mathfrak{g}$ is a graded vector space, then a differential $D$ of degree -1 squaring to 0 on $\vee^\bullet \mathfrak{g}$ is precisely the same as equipping $\mathfrak{g}$ with the structure of an [[L-∞ algebra]].

Dually, this corresponds to a general [[semifree dga]] 

$$
  CE(\mathfrak{g}) := (\wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^*, d = D^*)
  \,.
$$ 

This we may usefully think of as the Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra of the $L_\infty$-algebra $\mathfrak{g}$.

So _every_ commutative [[semifree dga]] (degreewise finite-dimensional) is the Chevaley-Eilenberg algebra of some [[L-∞ algebra]] of finite type.

This means that many constructions involving [[dg-algebra]]s are secretly about [[∞-Lie theory]]. For instance the [[Sullivan construction]] in [[rational homotopy theory]] may be interpreted in terms of [[Lie integration]] of $L_\infty$-algebras.




## Examples

### Abelian Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra

The CE-algebra of the Lie algebra of the [[circle group]] $\mathfrak{u}(1)$ is the graded-commutative dg-algebra on a single generator in degree 1 with vanishing differential.

More generally, the $L_\infty$-algebra $b^n \mathfrak{u}(1)$ is the one whose CE algebra is the commutative dg-algebra with a single generator in degree $n+1$ and vanishing differential.


### Of $\mathfrak{su}(2)$

The CE-algebra of $\}mathfrak{su}(2)$ has two generators $x, y, z$ in degree one and differential

$$
  d x_1 = x_2 \wegde x_3
$$

and cyclically.


### Weil algebra

For $\mathfrak{g}$ a [[Lie algebra]], the CE-algebra of the [[Lie 2-algebra]] given by the [[differential crossed module]] $(\mathfrak{g} \stackrel{Id}{\to} \mathfrak{g})$ is the [[Weil algebra]] $W(\mathfrak{g})$ of $\mathfrak{g}$

$$
  CE(\mathfrak{g} \stackrel{Id}{\to} \mathfrak{g})
  =
  W(\mathfrak{g})
  \,.
$$

### Lie algebra cohomology

[[Lie algebra cohomology]] of a $k$-[[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ with coefficients in the left $\mathfrak{g}$-module $M$ is defined as $H^*_{Lie}(\mathfrak{g},M) = Ext_{U\mathfrak{g}}^*(k,M)$. It can be computed as $Hom_{\mathfrak{g}}(CE(\mathfrak{g}),M)$ (a similar story is for [[Lie algebra homology]]).

A [[cocycle]] in degree n of the [[Lie algebra cohomology]] of a [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ with values in the trivial module $\mathbb{R}$ is a morphism of [[L-∞ algebra]]s

$$
  \mathfrak{g} \to b^{n-1} \mathfrak{u}(1)
  \,.
$$

In terms of CE-algebras this is a [[dg-algebra]] morphism

$$
  CE(\mathfrak{g}) \leftarrow CE(b^{n-1}\mathfrak{u}(1))
  \,.
$$

Since by the above example the dg-algebra on he right has a single generator in degree $n$ and vanishing differential, such a morphism is precisely the same thing as a degree $n$-element in $CE(\mathfrak{g})$, i.e. an element  $\omega \in \wedge^n \maathfrak{g}^*$ which is closed under the CE-differential 

$$
  d_{CE} \omega = 0
  \,.
$$

This is what one often sees as the definition of a cocycle in [[Lie algebra cohomology]]. However, from the general point of view of [[cohomology]], it is better to think of the cocycle equivalently as the morphism $\mathfrak{g} \to b^{n-1}\mathfrak{u}(1)$.

### Of the string Lie 2-algebra

For $\mathfrak{g}$ a semisimple Lie algebra with binary [[invariant polynomial]] $\langle -,-\rangle$, the CE-algebra of the [[string Lie 2-algebra]] is

$$
  CE(\mathfrak{string}) = (\wedge^\bullet( \mathfrak{g}^+ \oplus \mathbb{R}^*[1]), d_{strring})
$$

where the differential restricted to $\mathfrak{g}^*$ is $[-,-]^*$ while on the new generator $b$ spanning $\mathbb{R}^*[1]$ is it

$$
  d b = \langle -, [-,-]\rangle \in wedge^3 \mathfrak{g}^*
  \,.
$$



### BRST complex

In [[physics]], the Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra $CE(\mathfrak{g}, N)$ of the [[action]] of a  [[Lie algebra]] or [[L-∞ algebra]] of a [[gauge group]] $G$ on space $N$ of fields is called the [[BRST complex]].


In this context

* the generators in $N$ in degree 0 are called **fields**;

* the generators $\in \mathfrak{g}^*$ in degree $1$ are called **ghosts**;

* the generators in degree $2$ are called **ghosts of ghosts**;

* etc.

If $N$ is itself a [[chain complex]], then this is called a [[BV-BRST formalism|BV-BRST complex]]
