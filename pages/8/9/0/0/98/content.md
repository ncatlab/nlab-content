## Ordinary concept

Chevalley&#8211;Eilenberg algebras are differential graded commutative algebras which are used to define cohomology of Lie algebras. 


## Synthetic version

see 

* [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra in synthetic differential geomet|Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra in synthetic differential geometry]]


## Generalization in $\infty$-context

In the context of general [[Lie theory]] one notices that Chevalley&#8211;Eilenberg algebras generalized to arbitrary "quasi-free differential graded commutative algebras" are usefully thought of as providing a language that naturally allows to pass from Lie algebras to $L_\infty$-[[Lie infinity-algebroid|algebroid]]s: Chevalley&#8211;Eilenberg algebras are taken in this context to be the algebras of functions on [[NQ-supermanifolds]].

Closely related are [[Weil algebra]]s, which are the algebras of functions on the shifted tangent bundles of these [[NQ-supermanifolds]].


## Appearance in physics

In the physics literature Chevalley&#8211;Eilenberg algebras of $L_\infty$-[[Lie infinity-algebroid|algebroid]]s are addressed as [[BRST complexes]].

In this context

* the generators in degree 0 are called **fields**;

* the generators in degree $1$ are called **ghosts**;

* the generators in degree $2$ are called **ghosts of ghosts**;

* etc.
