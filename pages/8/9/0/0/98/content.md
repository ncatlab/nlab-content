## Of a Lie algebra

The _Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra_ $CE(\mathfrak{g})$ of a finite dimensional [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ is the [[semifree dga|semifree]] graded-commutative [[dg-algbra]] whose underlying graded algebra is the [[Grassmann algebra]] $\wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^*$ and whose [[differential]] $d$ is on $\mathfrak{g}^*$ the dual of the Lie bracket

$$
  d|_{\mathfrak{g}^*} := [-,-]^* : \mathfrak{g}^* \to \mathfrak{g}^* \wedge \mathfrak{g}^*
$$

extended uniquely as a graded [[derivation]] on $\wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^*$.

That this differential indeed squares to 0, $d \circ d = 0$ is precisely the fact that the Lie bracket satisfies the [[Jacobi identity]].


If we choose a dual basis $\{t^a\}$ of $\mathfrak{g}^*$ and let $\{C^a{}_{b c}\}$ be the structure constants of the Lie bracket in that basis, then the action of the differential on the basis generators is

$$
  d t^a = - \frac{1}{2} C^a{}_{b c} t^b \wedge t^c
  \,,
$$

where here and in the following a sum over repeated indices is implicit.

This has a more or less evident generalization to infinite-dimensional Lie algebras.

## Differential algebra and coalgebra

In fact the graded-commutative dg-algebra structures on $\wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^*$ is precisely in bijection with Lie algebra structures on $\mathfrak{g}$: the dual of the restriction of $d$ to $\mathfrak{g}^*$ defines a skew-linear bracket and the condition $d^2 = 0$ holds if and only if that bracket satisfies the Jacobi identity.

Therefore we may identify (finite-dimensional) Lie algebras on a vector space $\mathfrak{g}$ with [[semifree dga]]s generated by $\mathfrak{g}^*$. 

There is an analogous statement not involving the dualization: Lie algebra structures on $\mathfrak{g}$ are in bijection with the structure of a _differential graded coalgebra_ $(\vee^\bullet \mathfrak{g}, D)$ on the free graded-co-commutative coalgebra $\vee^\bullet \mathfrak{g}$ on $\mathfrak{g}$ with $D$ a [[derivation]] of degree -1 squaring to 0.

The relation between the differentials is simply dualization

$$
  (\vee^\bullet \mathfrak{g}, D) \leftrightarrow
  (\wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^* , (d \omega)(-) = \omega(D(-)))
  \,.
$$

## For $L_\infty$-algebras

This suggests a grand generalization by simply generalizing the [[Grassmann algebra]] over a [[vector space]] $\mathfrak{g}^*$ to the Grassmann algebra over a [[graded vector space]].

If $\mathfrak{g}$ is a graded vector space, then a differential $D$ of degree -1 squaring to 0 on $\vee^\bullet \mathfrak{g}$ is precisely the same as equipping $\mathfrak{g}$ with the structure of an [[L-infinity algebra]].

Dually, this corresponds to a general [[semifree dga]] 

$$
  CE(\mathfrak{f}) := (\wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^*, d = D^*)
  \,.
$$ 

This we may usefully think of as the Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra of the $L_\infty$-algebra $\mathfrak{g}$.




## Examples

### Abelian Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra

The CE-algebra of the Lie algebra of the [[circle]] group $\mathfrak{u}(1)$ is the graded-commutative dg-algebra on a single generator in degree 1 with vanishing differential.

More generally, the $L_\infty$-algebra $b^n \mathfrak{u}(1)$ is the one whose CE algebra is the commutative dg-algebra with a single generator in degree $n+1$ and vanishing differential.


### Of $\mathfrak{su}(2)$

The CE-algebra of $\}mathfrak{su}(2)$ has two generators $x, y, z$ in degree one and differential

$$
  d x_1 = x_2 \wegde x_3
$$

and cyclically.

### Weil algebra

For $\mathfrak{g}$ a [[Lie algebra]], the CE-algebra of the [[Lie 2-algebra]] given by the [[differential crossed module]] $(\mathfrak{g} \stackrel{Id}{\to} \mathfrak{g})$ is the [[Weil algebra]] $W(\mathfrak{g})$ of $\mathfrak{g}$

$$
  CE(\mathfrak{g} \stackrel{Id}{\to} \mathfrak{g})
  =
  W(\mathfrak{g})
  \,.
$$

### BRST complex

In [[physics]], the Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra $CE(\mathfrak{g}, N)$ of the [[action]] of a  [[Lie algebra]] or [[L-∞ algebra]] of a [[gauge group]] $G$ on space $N$ of fields is called the [[BRST complex]].


In this context

* the generators in $N$ in degree 0 are called **fields**;

* the generators $\in \mathfrak{g}^*$ in degree $1$ are called **ghosts**;

* the generators in degree $2$ are called **ghosts of ghosts**;

* etc.

If $N$ is itself a [[chain complex]], then this is called a [[BV-BRST formalism|BV-BRST complex]]
