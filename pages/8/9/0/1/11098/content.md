## Idea

The concept of _coherent $(\infty,1)$-topos_ is a notion of _[[compact topos]]_ in the context of [[(∞,1)-topos theory]] ([[Spectral Schemes|Lurie VII, def. 3.1]]).

## Properties


### Commutativity with filtered colimits

Notice that a [[compact object in an (∞,1)-category]] is one that distributes over [[filtered (∞,1)-colimits]].

In an $n$-coherent $\infty$-topos the [[global section geometric morphism]] (given by homming out of the [[terminal object]]) preserves [[filtered (∞,1)-colimits]] of [[truncated object in an (infinity,1)-topos|(n-1)-truncated objects]].
