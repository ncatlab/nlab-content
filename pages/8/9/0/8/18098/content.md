## Idea

The definition of a **Gorenstein ring spectrum** is motivated by the [[Gorenstein ring|Gorenstein condition]] for rings. A Gorenstein ring, $R$, is a commutative Noetherian local ring such that $Ext^{\ast}_
R(k, R)$ is one dimensional as a $k$-vector space. This last condition may be restated as the property that the homology of the (right
derived) Hom complex $Hom_R(k, R)$ is equivalent to a suspension of $k$.

Thus, a [[ring spectrum]] $\mathbf{R} \to \mathbf{k}$ is said to be Gorenstein if there is an equivalence of $\mathbf{R}$-modules $Hom_{\mathbf{R}}(\mathbf{k}, \mathbf{R}) \simeq \Sigma^a\mathbf{k}$ for some integer $a$.

A ring, $R \to k$, is [[Gorenstein ring|Gorenstein]] if and only if the ring spectrum $H R \to H k$ is Gorenstein. 

## Examples

Examples from representation theory, from chromatic stable homotopy theory and from rational homotopy theory are given in ([Greenlees16, Sec. 23](#Greenlees16)).
