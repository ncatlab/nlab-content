## Idea

The *reflection* of an [[object]] $d$ in a [[category]] $D$ along a [[functor]] $F \colon  C\to D$ is a [[morphism]] $\eta_d$ in $D$, playing the role of a  would-be [[unit of an adjunction]] $L\dashv F$ (which may not exist in general), satisfying that part of the [[universal property]] of the unit for that component. If a reflection of each object in $D$ along $F$ exists and is chosen then the [[left adjoint]] $L$ to $F$ does exists.

Similarly, one can define a coreflection along a functor by a [[morphism]] $\epsilon_d$ in $D$ playing the role of the would-be [[counit of an adjunction]] $F\dashv R$.

## Definition

Let $F \colon C\to D$ be a [[functor]] and $d$ an object of the [[category]] $D$. 

A __reflection__ of $d$ along $F$ (synonym: __universal arrow__ from $d$ to $F$) is a [[pair]] $(L_d,\eta_d)$ of 

* an [[object]] $L_d\in C$ 

* a [[morphism]] $\eta_d \colon d\to F(L_d)$ in $D$ 

which is [[universal property|universal]] in the sense that for any [[object]] $c \in C$ and morphism $f \colon d\to F(c)$ there is a unique $\alpha \colon L_d\to c$ such that $F(\alpha)\circ\eta_d = f$. In other words, it is an initial object in the [[comma category]] $d/F$.

In other words this means that a reflection is an [[relative adjunction|adjoint relative to]] the functor $1 \to D$ which picks out $d \in D$.

[[formal duality|Dually]], a  __coreflection__ of $d$ along $F$ is a [[pair]] $(R_d,\epsilon_d)$ of 

* an [[object]] $R_c\in C$ 

* a [[morphism]] $\epsilon_d \colon F(R_d)\to d$ in $D$ 

which is universal in the sense that for any $c\in C$ and a morphism $g \colon F(c)\to d$ there is a unique $\beta \colon c\to R_d$ such that $\epsilon_d\circ F(\beta) = g$. 

In other words this means that a coreflection is a [[relative coadjunction|coadjoint relative to]] the functor $1 \to D$ which picks out $d \in D$.

If $F:C\to D$ is a [[pseudofunctor]] among bicategories (homomorphism of bicategories) and $d$ an object of $D$, then a __biuniversal arrow__ from $d$ to $F$ is an [[object]] $L$ in $C$ and a morphism $u:L\to F(c)$ such that for every object $c$ in $C$ the functor $Hom_C(L,c)\to Hom_D(d,F(c))$ given by $f\mapsto F(f)\circ u$, $\gamma\mapsto F(\gamma)\circ 1_u$ (where $f,f':d\to c$ and $\gamma:f\to f'$ is a 2-cell) is an [[equivalence of categories]].
