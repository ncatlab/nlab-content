## Idea

A **star-polycategory** is to a [[star-autonomous category]] what a [[multicategory]] is to a [[monoidal category]]. It is a [[polycategory]] in which 
every object has a dual. As such it is a model of classical linear logic with no connectives except negation.

## Definition

There are a number of candidate definitions, depending on what we make strict.

### Definition in terms of duals

Let $A$ be an object in a symmetric polycategory. A _dual_ for $A$ comprises an object $A^*$ together with a morphism $Hom(A,A^*;-)$ making the induced composition $Hom(\Gamma;A,\Delta)\to Hom(\Gamma,A^*;\Delta)$ a bijection for all $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$. 

A symmetric _star-polycategory_ is a symmetric polycategory in which every object has a dual. 

### Strict involution

In any star-polycategory there is an isomorphism $A^{**}\cong A$ for all $A$. We could also require equality, $A^{**}=A$. This holds in many concrete examples, and it holds in syntactic examples that are based on negation-normal-form. The following definition is used in ([Hyland, Sec 5.3](#Hyland)):

* A collection of objects, together with an involution operation $(-)^*$ (so $A^{**}=A$).
* For lists $\Gamma$, $\Delta$ of objects, a set $Hom(\Gamma;\Delta)$.
* _Exchange and negation structure:_ Two lists $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$ induce a single list $\Gamma^*,\Delta$ by concatenating $\Gamma^*$ with $\Delta$. Each object-preserving-bijection $\Gamma^*,\Delta\to\Pi^*,\Sigma$ should induce a function $Hom(\Gamma;\Delta)\to \Hom(\Pi;\Sigma)$, compatible with composition of bijections.
* For each object $\Gamma$, an identity morphism $Hom(A;A)$.
* For lists $\Gamma,\Delta,\Pi,\Sigma$ and objects $A$, a composition function
$$Hom(\Gamma;A,\Delta)\times Hom(\Pi,A;\Sigma)\to Hom(\Gamma,\Pi;\Delta,\Sigma)$$
respecting the exchange and negation structure, and satisfying identity and associativity laws.

### Entries only 

In a star-polycategory we have natural bijections $Hom(\Gamma;\Delta)\cong Hom(-;\Gamma^*,\Delta)\cong Hom(\Gamma,\Delta^*;-)$. In many concrete examples these bijections are equalities. Moreover, it could be argued that in many concrete examples the explicit direction of morphisms in a two-sided polycategory isn't meaningful. This leads us to the following one-sided or entries only definition. It corresponds to one-sided presentation of sequent calculus. 

* A collection of objects, together with an involution $(-)^*$ (so $A^{**}=A$).
* For any list $\Gamma$ of objects, a set $Hom(\Gamma)$ of "morphisms".
* Each object-preserving-bijection $\Gamma\to \Delta$ should induce a function $Hom(\Gamma)\to \Hom(\Delta)$, compatible with composition of bijections.
* For each object $A$, an identity morphism $Hom(A,A^*)$.
* For lists $\Gamma,\Delta$ and objects $A$, a composition function
$$Hom(\Gamma,A)\times Hom(A^*,\Delta)\to Hom(\Gamma,\Delta)$$
respecting the exchange structure and satisfying identity and associativity laws.

## Examples

* Recall that a [[linearly distributive category]] can be understood as a representable polycategory. It is star-autonomous if the corresponding polycategory is a star-polycategory. 

* For example, [[profunctors]] form a (weak) star-polycategory. The objects are categories, $A^*=A^{\mathrm{op}}$, and (using the entries-only definition) $Hom(A_1,\dots,A_n)=Cat(A_1\dots\times\dots A_n,\mathbf{Set})$. The hom-functors are identities, and composition is given by [[coends]]. 

* The unit interval forms a thin star polycategory. The objects are real numbers in the interval $[0,1]$, and the involution is $A^*=(1-A)$. $Hom(A_1,\dots A_n)$ is inhabited if $\sum_{i=1}^n A_i = 1$, i.e. if the list partitions the interval. Note that this polycategory is not representable, for example, we cannot combine $1$ with anything except $0$. 

* More generally, any [[effect algebra]] forms a thin star-polycategory in the same way. Sequences $\Gamma$ for which $Hom(\Gamma)$ is inhabited are usually called "tests". The tensor in the polycategorical sense is the partial monoid in the effect algebra sense.
