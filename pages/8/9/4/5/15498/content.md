Bharucha, like Campbell before him, is intensely focused on improving Cooper Union's name recognition. Cooper Union has historically not been very well known, even among New Yorkers: they often think it's some kind of labor union, rather than an undergraduate college. That's fine: the people who matter &#8212; the teenagers applying to the art school, the entire architectural profession &#8212; know exactly what Cooper Union is, and what it stands for. Not every non-profit organization needs its own awareness campaign &#8212; but of course if Cooper Union now has to start attracting richer kids capable of paying $20,000 a year in tuition, it's going to have to start marketing itself more aggressively. Again, that's not something it historically ever wanted or needed to do, and it's not something Peter Cooper would be remotely happy about. His resources were meant to go towards education, not towards marketing and billing and "development".
