I'm very excited about New York's bikeshare program, and look forward to using it regularly. I hope that the increase in the number of cyclists will help bring a bit more civility to New York's biking community, especially in terms of stopping at lights and riding in the right direction. Meanwhile, my biggest fear is that we'll see the opposite: a bunch of people who have no idea what they're doing, riding on sidewalks, salmoning, and generally causing chaos. I don't think that's probable, but it's possible, and I look forward to Citibike and NYC doing everything they can to prevent it from happening. As they do so, Liu's report &#8212; if not his press release &#8212; is likely to be quite helpful.A couple of weeks ago,  had an intriguing story: Mortgage Resolution Partners, a politically well-connected firm in San Francisco, was shopping to municipalities the idea of using eminent domain to restructure mortgages. Then, on Tuesday, Cornell University's  weighed in, saying that the idea was a compelling one. "To solve a collective action problem, we need a collective agent," he wrote. "That's what governments are."
