More to the point, I simply don't believe Cohen when he writes that he only breaks the red-light rule "if and only if no pedestrian is in the crosswalk and no car is in the intersection". What about when there's a pedestrian in the crosswalk who's walking away from the bike? I'll bet he does it then, too. The point is, when you can make up your own rules, you can also make up when to bend them. I can understand that Cohen would prefer it if New York had rules like Idaho's. But whatever the rules are, we should obey them. If Cohen wants to agitate for a change in the rules, I'll join him and support him. But I'm not going to pretend that it's OK to break the rules just because you think the rules should be changed.
