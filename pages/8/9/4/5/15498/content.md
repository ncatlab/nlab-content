Maybe that just makes me a tightwad, and maybe America has millions of people who are happy dropping $100 on the experience of funding some exciting new project, just for the way it makes them feel. But it seems to me that one of Kickstarter's greatest successes is the way in which it has managed to change the way we think about cost. I funded , for instance, to the tune of $15. (On average, the magazine's 1,548 backers paid more than $25 each.) If some as-yet nonexistent magazine had sent me a piece of direct mail, asking $15 for its launch issue, I would never have paid that. Even if an existing magazine looked really good on the newsstand, and had a cover price of $15, I would similarly never pay that. But somehow the idea that by paying the $15 up front I was helping to create that magazine &#8212; that was enough to get me to pay. That, and the fact that the founders of Tomorrow magazine are in my social graph &#8212; I'm helping out friends as much as I'm buying a product.
