Taken together, these two loopholes may have enabled the creation of  fake transactions in UBS's systems.? Even if this was the immediate  cause of the fraud, the bank's risk controllers seem to have missed  other warning signs.? High gross trading positions, even if the trader  reported his position as hedged, plus what were presumably significant  cash outflows in margin as the result of losing futures positions, might  together have been expected to flag that something was wrong.? Perhaps  this is how the fraud was eventually spotted.
