The 2nd Circuit said not only that Cedarbaum erred in her analysis of standing but also that all of the federal judges who have restricted MBS class claims to offerings in which name plaintiffs invested have applied the wrong reasoning. According to the appeals court, the correct question to guide MBS standing determinations is whether other certificate holders have "the same set of concerns" as the name plaintiff. (Oddly, that language comes from the U.S. Supreme Court's 2003 ruling on affirmative action,?.) In the MBS context, the court said, plaintiffs' claims are based on alleged misrepresentations about the quality of the loans underwritten by particular mortgage originators. So according to the 2nd Circuit, MBS class action plaintiffs have standing to bring claims on behalf of all investors whose certificates were backed by loans from the same lenders that supplied the mortgages underlying the name plaintiff's notes.When Congress passed the Dodd-Frank financial reform law in 2010, it provided broad protection for whistle-blowers. The law prohibited employers from retaliating against anyone who reported securities violations to the Securities and Exchange Commission, assisted in an SEC investigation or otherwise made disclosures required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 or any other securities law. Dodd-Frank also defined criteria for whistle-blowers: They are people who provide information about securities violations "in a manner established, by rule or regulation, by the Commission." In August 2011, the SEC issued its final interpretation of Dodd-Frank's provisions, requiring that whistle-blowers must have a reasonable belief that they're reporting violations of securities laws and must follow specific procedures when giving that information to the commission.
