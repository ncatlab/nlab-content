## Idea

For $X$ a [[space]] equipped with a notion of [[dimension]] $dim X \in \mathbb{N}$ and a notion of [[Kähler differential forms]], 
a _$\Theta$-characteristic of $X$ is a choice of [[square root]] of the [[canonical characteristic class]] of $X$. See there for more details.

## Examples

### Over Riemann surfaces
 {#OverRiemannSurfaces}

For $X$ a [[Riemann surface]], the choices of square roots of the canonical bundle correspond to the choice of [[spin structures]] ([Atiyah, prop. 3.2](#Atiyah)). For $X$ of [[genus of a surface|genus]] $g$, there are $2^{2g}$ many choices of square roots of the canonical bundle. 

The function that sends a square root line bundle to the [[dimension]] of its space of [[holomorphic sections]] $mod 2$ is a [[quadratic refinement]] of the [[intersection pairing]] on $H^1(X, \mathbb{Z}_2)$ ([Atiyah, theorem 2](#Atiyah)).
