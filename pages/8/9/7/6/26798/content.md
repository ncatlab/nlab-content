## Idea

Am __elementary matrix__ is a [[square matrix]] which is obtained from the [[identity matrix]] by performing one [[row operation]], that is either 

1. interchanging two rows (in which case it is a [[permutation matrix]]), 

1. rescaling the row by multiplying it with a nonzero element, 

1. or adding a multiple of one row to some other row.
