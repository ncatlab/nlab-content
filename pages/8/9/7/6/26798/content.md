## Idea

__Elementary matrix__ is a square matrix which is obtained from the identity matrix by performing one [[row operation]], that is either interchanging two rows (in which case it is a [[permutation matrix]]), rescaling the row by multiplying it with a nonzero element, or adding a multiple of one row to some other row.
