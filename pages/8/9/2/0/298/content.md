## Idea

Vertex operator algebras (or "vertex algebras", for short) are [[algebras]] with a product-operation parameterized by points in the [[complex plane]]. 

Vertex operator algebras equipped with an [[action]] of the [[Virasoro algebra]] encode the local ([[genus of a surface|genus-0]] behaviour) of [[2-dimensional conformal field theories]]. Here one may think of the [[complex plane]] as the [[Riemann sphere]] and of the $z$-parameterized product operation in the vertex algebras as being the [[n-point function|3-point function]] of the [[2d CFT]] with field insertions at the points 0, $z$ and $\infty$. In fact one vertex operator algebra enodes (only) one chiral/holomorphic half of such a genus-0 2d CFT; a full genus-0 2d CFT is given by the combination of two vertex operator algebras called a _[[full field algebra]]_.

The traditional definition of _vertex operator algebra_ (VOA) is long and tends to be somewhat unenlightening. But due to ([Huang 91](#Huang)) it is now known that vertex operator algebras have equivalenlty an [[FQFT]]-type characterization which manifestly captures this relation to [[n-point functions]] in the [[2d CFT]]:

There is a [[monoidal category]] or [[operad]] whose [[morphism|morphisms]] are conformal spheres with $n$-punctures marked as incoming and one puncture marked as outgoing (each puncture equipped with a conformally parametrized annular neighborhood). Composition of such spheres is by gluing along punctures. This can be regarded as a category $2Cob_{conf}^0$ of 2-dimensional genus-0 conformal [[cobordism|cobordisms]].

As shown by theorems by [[Yi-Zhi Huang]] and [[Liang Kong]], a vertex operator algebra is precisely a _[[holomorphic representation]]_ of this category, or [[algebra over an operad]] for this [[operad]] i.e. an genus-0 [[conformal field theory|conformal]] [[FQFT]], hence a [[monoidal functor]]

$$
  V : 2Cob_{conf}^0 \to Vect
$$

such that its component $V_1$ is a holomorphic function on the moduli space of conformal punctured spheres.

## Standard definition

(under construction) A __vertex algebra__ consists of the following data:

* nonnegatively graded complex vector space $V = \oplus_{n =0}^\infty V_n$
* vacuum vector $|0\rangle\in V_0$
* a shift operator $T: V\to V$ 
* operation $Y = Y(-,z) : V\to End V [ [z,z^{-1}] ]$ 



This data satisfy three axioms: 

(vacuum)

(translation axiom)

(locality)

In practice, the most important case is when the shift $T$ is related to a conformal vector "the energy momentum tensor" $\omega$ whose Fourier components are related to the generators $L_i$ of the [[Virasoro Lie algebra]] $Vir$. In that case we talk about a __conformal vertex algebra__.

There is a notion of a module over a vertex algebra. A conformal vertex algebra $A$ is said to be __rational__ if every $A$-module is completely reducible. Then it follows that there are only finitely many nonisomorphic simple $A$-modules.  

## Properties
 {#Properties}

### Category of vertex operator algebras
 {#CategoryOfVOAs}

Vertex operator algebras naturally form a [[category]] (see section 2.4 of ([FrenkenHuangLepowsky](#FrenkenHuangLepowsky)). This is naturally a [[monoidal category]] with respect to [[tensor product]] of VOAs (section 2.5).

This is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to 

* the category of algebras over the holomorphic punctured sphere operad ([Huang](#HuangCFT)); 

* the category of vertex operator coalgebras ([Hubbard](#Hubbard)).

### Modular category of modules over a VOA
 {#ModularTensorCategories}

The [[category]] of [[modules]]/[[representations]] over a given vertex operator algebra is a [[modular tensor category]], ([Huang](#Huang))

### Goddard-Thorn theorem

* [[Goddard-Thorn theorem]]

### Relation to $A_\infty$-algebras and RG fixed points
 {#RelationToAInfinityAlgebras}

A [[functor]] from the category of  [[BRST complex|BRST]]-VOAs to that of [[A-infinity algebra]]s is described in

* [[Anton Zeitlin]], _Quasiclassical Lian-Zuckerman Homotopy Algebras, Courant Algebroids and Gauge Theory_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.3652))

and argued to algebraically encode the [[effective QFT|effective]] [[string theory]] background encoded by the [[CFT]] given by the VOA.

### Relation to conformal nets

Subject to some conditions, from a vertex operator algebra one may induce a [[conformal net]] and conversely ([Capri-Kawahigahshi-Longo-Weiner 15](#CapriKawahigahshiLongoWeiner15)).

## Examples

A class of examples are _[[current algebras]]_ .

A database of examples is given by ([Gannon-H&#246;hn](#GannonHoehn)).

The [[Moonshine]] module over the [[Griess algebra]] admits the structure of a vertex operator algebra, which has

* rank 24;

* is a self-[[dual object]] in the category of VOAs;

* has trivial degree-1 subspaces.

A conjecture by Frenkel, Lepowsky and Meurman says that the Moonshine VOA is, up to isomorphism the unique VOA with these properties.

See at _[[monster vertex algebra]]_.
