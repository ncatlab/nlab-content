The usual definition of _vertex operator algebra_ is long and unenlightning. But due to work by Huang and Kong it is known now that vertex operator algebras are nothing but certain [[FQFT]]s:

There is a [[monoidal category]] whose [[morphism|morphisms]] are conformal spheres with $n$-punctures marked as incoming and one puncture marked as outgoing (each puncture equipped with a conformally parametrized annular neighborhood). Composition of such spheres is by gluing along puctures. This can be regarded as a category $2Cob_{conf}^0$ of 2-dimensional genus-0 conformal [[cobordism|cobordisms]].

As shown by theorems by Huang and Kong, a vertex operator algebra is precisely a _[[holomorphic representation]]_ of this category, i.e. an genus-0 conformal [[FQFT]], hence a [[monoidal functor]]

$$
  V : 2Cob_{conf}^0 \to Vect
$$

such that its component $V_1$ is a holomorphic function on the moduli space of conformal punctured spheres.
