#Idea#

In the context of [[homotopy coherent category theory]] one wishes to nicely pair [[enriched category theory]] with [[homotopy theory]] for the case that the category $V$ being enriched over is a [[model category]] or at least a [[homotopical category]].

The idea is that a _closed (symmetric) monoidal homotopical category_ is a [[closed category|closed]] [[monoidal category]] which is also  [[homotopical category|homotopical]] such that its [[homotopy category]] $Ho_V$ is still itself [[closed category|closed]] [[monoidal category|monoidal]].

A category enriched over such $V$ may be an [[enriched homotopical category]].

#Definition#

A _closed (symmetric) monoidal homotopical category_ $V_0$ is a
[[closed category|closed]], [[monoidal category|symmetric monoidal]] [[homotopical category|homotopical]] category which is furthermore equipped with a [[closed monoidal deformation retract]].

 Could anyone provide a list of _examples_? Mike?

###### Proposition
The [[homotopy category]] $Ho_V$ of a closed (symmetric)
monoidal homotopical category $V$ is itself 
closed (symmetric) monoidal.
