## Idea

If $J\colon I \to C$ is a [[diagram]] and $x$ is its [[limit]] in $C$, then we may na&#239;vely say that this limit is _preserved_ by a [[functor]] $F\colon C \to D$ if $F(x)$ is the limit of the [[composite]] diagram $I \overset{J}\to C \overset{F}\to D$.  However, it is not enough to state this at the level of objects; we also need to impose some coherence conditions, preserving the entire universal [[cone]].  Furthermore, we can use a trick involving the [[Yoneda embedding]] to get a meaningful condition even if $J$ has no limit in $C$ at all.


## Definitions

Let $J\colon I \to C$ be a [[diagram]] and let $F\colon C \to D$ be a [[functor]].

Recall (see [[limit]]) that a [[cone]] over $J$ in $C$ may be defined as an [[object]] $x$ of $C$ together with a [[natural transformation]] to $J$ from the composite $\const^I_x\colon I \overset{!}\to \mathbf{1} \overset{\{x\}}\to C$, where $\mathbf{1}$ is the [[terminal category]].  Then a [[terminal object]] in the category of these cones (if it exists) is a [[limit]] of $J$ in $C$.  Thus, a limit consists of an object $x$ and a natural transformation $\eta\colon \const^I_x \to J$.

The functor $F$ __preserves__ the limit $(x,\eta)$ if $(F(x),F\cdot\eta)$ is a limit of the functor $F \circ J$ in $D$.  (Here, $F\cdot\eta\colon \const^I_{F(x)} \to F \circ J$ is a [[whiskering]].)

Dually, $F$ __preserves__ a [[colimit]] of $J$ if $F^\op\colon C^\op \to D^\op$ preserves it as a limit of $J^\op\colon I^\op \to C^\op$.

For instance:

* Let $I$ be the [[empty category]], so that a limit of the unique functor $J\colon I \to C$ is a [[terminal object]] $1$.  Then $F$ preserves this terminal object if and only if $F(1)$ is a terminal object of $D$.

* Let $I$ be the [[discrete category]] $\mathbf{2}$, so that $J$ picks out two objects $a$ and $b$ of $C$ and the limit of $J$ is a [[product]] $a \times b$ of $a$ and $b$.  Note that this product comes equipped with product projections $\pi\colon a \times b \to a$ and $\rho\colon a \times b \to b$.  Then $F$ preserves this product if and only if $F(a \times b)$ is a product of $F(a)$ and $F(b)$ and furthermore the product projections are $F(\pi)$ and $F(\rho)$.

If $F$ preserves all limits or colimits of a given type (i.e. over a given category $I$), we simply say that $F$ preserves that sort of limit (e.g. $F$ preserves [[products]], $F$ preserves [[equalizers]], etc.).

A functor that preserves all small limits in $C$ that exist is called a __[[continuous functor]]__.  Usually this term is only used when $C$ has all small limits, i.e. is a [[complete category]].


## Examples
  {#Examples}

* [[limits preserve limits]]

* [[hom-functors preserve limits]]

* [[adjoints preserve (co-)limits]]

* {#ExampleYonedaEmbedding} the [[Yoneda embedding]] preserves limits (see [there](Yoneda+embedding#PreservesLimits))


## Preservation of weighted limits

Analogously, an [[enriched functor]] between [[enriched categories]] may preserve [[weighted limits]].  Are there any tricky points that we should mention?


## Preservation of limits that don\'t exist

Sometimes we want to say that a functor $F\colon C \to D$ preserves a limit that does not actually exist in $C$.  For instance, a __finitely continuous functor__ is usually defined as one that preserves all finite limits.  If $C$ is a [[finitely complete category]], then this is fine; such a functor is called __[[left exact functor|left exact]]__.  But what if $C$ does not have all finite limits?

If $C$ and $D$ are [[locally small category|locally small]], then we can use the [[Yoneda lemma]] to turn the question into one involving categories that *do* have the required limits (and in fact have all limits), the [[presheaf categories]] $[C^op,Set]$ and $[D^op,Set]$.  (For colimits, use $[C,Set]$ and $[D,Set]$; for $V$-enriched categories, use $[C^op,V]$ and $[D^op,V]$, which will work if $V$ is complete.)

The left [[Kan extension]] of the composite $C \overset{F}\to D \overset{Yon}\hookrightarrow [D^\op,Set]$ along the [[Yoneda embedding]] $C \overset{Yon}\hookrightarrow [C^\op,Set]$ (which always exists) is a functor from $[C^op,Set]$ to $[D^op,Set]$, which may be written as $- \otimes F$ (alluding to the [[bimodule]] nature of [[profunctors]]).  A diagram $J\colon I \to C$ becomes a diagram $I \overset{J}\to C \overset{Yon}\hookrightarrow [C^op,Set]$ in $[C^op,Set]$, where it has a limit.  If $- \otimes F$ preserves this limit, then we say that $F$ __preserves__ the hypothetical limit of $J$.

Since the Yoneda embedding preserves and [[reflected limit|reflects]] all limits, if $J$ has a limit in $C$, then this condition is equivalent to the condition that $F$ preserve it in the ordinary sense, but in general it is stronger than requiring that $F$ preserve the limit only if it exists in $C$.

Finishing the motivating example, a __[[flat functor]]__ may be defined as one that preserves all finite limits, whether or not they exist.
