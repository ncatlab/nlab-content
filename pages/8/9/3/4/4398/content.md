Recall that [[Cat]] is generally used to denote the (or a) [[category]] (or [[2-category]]) of [[categories]] (and [[functors]] and [[natural transformations]]).  Of course, we cannot usually expect to have a category of *all* categories, for the same reasons we cannot have a set of all sets, so $Cat$ usually denotes the category of [[small categories]], whatever that means in your chosen [[foundations]].  Of course, $Cat$ is then not a small category but a [[large category]].

In some foundations, such as [[Grothendieck universes]], it nevertheless makes sense to talk about the "category of [[large categories]]," which is itself not a large category (for the same reason) but a "very large" category (some older work calls it a [[metacategory]]).  It is fairly common to denote this "very large" category (or 2-category) by $CAT$.
