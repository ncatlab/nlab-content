## Selected writings

In [[electromagnetism]], *Ohm's law* states that, in an [[electric conductor]], the [[electric current]] $\vec J$ is proportional to the [[electric field]] $\vec E$. This linear relationship is encoded by a [[matrix]] called the *resistivity* [[tensor]] $\rho$

$$
  \vec E \,=\, \rho \cdot \vec J
  \,,
$$

or equivalently by its [[inverse matrix]], called the *conductivity* tensor $\sigma$

$$
  \vec J \,=\, \sigma \cdot \vec E
  \,.
$$
