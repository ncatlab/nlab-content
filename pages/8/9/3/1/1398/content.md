Given [[category|categories]] $C$ and $D$, the _anafunctor category_ $D^C$ has [[anafunctor|anafunctors]] $F: C \to D$ as [[object|objects]] and [[ananatural transformation|ananatural transformations]] between these as [[morphism|morphisms]].

This is the appropriate notion of [[functor category]] to use in the absence of the [[axiom of choice]] (including many [[internal category|internal]] situations).

Functor categories serve as the [[hom-category|hom-categories]] in the [[anabicategory]] [[Cat]].
