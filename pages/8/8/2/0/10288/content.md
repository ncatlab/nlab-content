## Idea

What is called the _ultraviolet catastrophe_ is a [[paradox]] in [[classical field theory]]/[[statistical mechanics]] which predicts an infinite amount of energy in high [[frequency]] (whence: ultraviolet) [[black body radiation]].

The observed absence of the [[ultraviolet catastrophe]] in [[experiment]] (a kind of [[null result]]) led to the hypothesis of [[energy]]/[[frequency]]-quantization (now expressed by [[Planck's constant]]) and hence to the development of [[quantum physics]].
