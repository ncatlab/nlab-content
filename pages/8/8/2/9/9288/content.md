## **Modules**

### 1-Modules

#### Physics motivation: Phases and superposition of states

In [[quantum mechanics]]

* [[superposition principle]] says: [[quantum states]] form an additive [[abelian group]];

* complex phases means: [[quantum states]] are acted on by [[complex numbers]].

Together: [[space of quantum states]] is a $\mathbb{C}$-[[module]] = $\mathbb{C}$-[[vector space]].

#### Modules

#### Vector bundles


### $(\infty,n)$-Modules

#### Physics motivation: Higher order states in extended QFT

There two key classes of examples of [[(∞,n)-categories]] of relevance in [[physics]]. One is clearly the [[(∞,n)-categories of cobordisms]] $Bord_n^S$ (with some specified extra structure $S$) which by the theory of [[extended quantum field theory]] are the [[domain]] of [[monoidal (∞,n)-functors]]

$$
  Z \;\colon\; Bord_n^S \to \mathcal{C}
  \,.
$$

In the abstract mathematical discussion the [[codomain]] $\mathcal{C}$ here is usually allowed to be any [[symmetric monoidal (∞,n)-category]]. But we expect that for those quantum field theories of actual relevance in [[physics]] (notably those obtained by [[quantization]] from [[extended prequantum field theories]]) the [[codomain]] here is special. Notably in [[codimension]] 1 for $\Sigma_{n-1}$ a [[closed manifold]] of [[dimension]] $n-1$ the value $Z(\Sigma_{n-1})$ should be the [[space of quantum states]] over $\Sigma_{n-1}$ and thus be a _$\mathbb{C}$-[[module]]_ (a complex [[vector space]]) possibly with some extra properties and structure (e.g. a [[topological vector space]], a [[Hilbert space]], etc., depending on the precise details).

Therefore we expect that for relevant [[theory (physics)|theories of physics]] in [[dimension]] $n$, $\mathcal{C}$ is something that deserves to be called an _[[(∞,n)-category]] of [[(∞,n)-modules]]_ (maybe: [[(∞,n)-vector spaces]])

$$
  \mathcal{C}
  \simeq
  n Mod_{R}
$$
