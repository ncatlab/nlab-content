## Idea

A **Turing machine** is a [[model of computation]]. It can be thought of as a machine with a set of possible internal states that uses an infinite (in both directions) piece of tape with countably-many positions available for symbols (drawn from a specified set of symbols). There is a pointer that selects the current position on the tape. Every timestep, it can, in this order:

* Remove or change the symbol that it is currently pointing to;

* Point to the square of tape to the left or to the right of the square that it is currently pointing to;

* Change its state.

It then repeats this sequence until its state is a _halting_ state, if ever, where a halting state is one special state specified in advance.
