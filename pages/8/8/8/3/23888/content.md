## Idea

The notion of a *Heyting algebra object* is the generalization of that of *[[Heyting algebra]]* as one passes from the ambient [[category of sets]] [[internalization|into]] more general ambient  [[categories]] with suitable properties.

## Definition

In a [[finitely complete category]] $C$, a **Heyting algebra object** is a [[bicartesian closed preordered object]] that is also a [[partially ordered object]].
