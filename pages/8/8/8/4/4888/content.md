## Idea

An **associated $\infty$-bundle** $E \to X$ is a [[fiber bundle]] in an [[(∞,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$ with typical fiber $F \in \mathbf{H}$ that is classified by a [[cocycle]] $X \to \mathbf{B}Aut(F)$ with coefficients in the [[delooping]] of the [[automorphism ∞-group]] of $F$.  We say this is _associated to_ the corresponding  $Aut(F)$-[[principal ∞-bundle]]. 

## Definition

Let $\mathbf{H}$ be an [[(∞,1)-topos]]. 

+-- {: .un_def}
###### Definition

For $F,X \in \mathbf{H}$ [[pointed object]]s, an **$\infty$-fiber bundle** on $X$ with fiber $F$ is a [[fiber sequence]]

$$
  F \to E \to X
$$

which is locally trivial (...).

+-- {: .un_remark}
###### Remark

By the [Properties](#Properties) discussed below we have that such $\infty$-fiber bundles are classified by morphism $X \to \mathbf{B}Auf(F)$. These also classify $Aut(F)$-[[principal ∞-bundle]]s. We may say that $E$ is **associated** to this corresponding principal $\infty$-bundle.

###### Theorem

$\infty$-Fiber bundles $F \to E \to X$ are classified by morphisms $X \to \mathbf{B} Aut(F)$.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


This is shown in ([Wendt](#Wendt)), section 5.5, using [[model category]]-theoretic presentations (see [[models for ∞-stack (∞,1)-toposes]])

###### Remark


This generalizes to associated $\infty$-bundles the statement (discussed at [[principal ∞-bundle]]) that $G$-principal $\infty$-bundles $P \to X$ are precisely the [[homotopy fiber]]s of [[cocycle]] morphism $X \to \mathbf{B}G$.

Notice that the $(\infty,1)$-topos theoretic argument at [[principal ∞-bundle]] uses crucially that in the [[(∞,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$ we have $(\infty,1)$-[[universal colimits]]. In [Wendt](#Wendt)) precisely the analogous [[homotopy colimit]]-properties produce the above result. Using these the result follows in analogy to [May](#May).

###### Proposition

The universal $F$-$\infty$-bundle $\mathbf{E} F \to \mathbf{B}Aut(F)$ is presented by the [[bar construction]]

$$
  F \to B(*, Aut(F), F) \to B(*, Aut(F), *)
  \,.
$$
