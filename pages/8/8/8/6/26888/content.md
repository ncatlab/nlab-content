## Idea

The classical Capelli identity is an equality of differential operators written in a form roughly
resembling the classical identity $det(A B) = det(A) det(B)$ where however at the right hand side are true determinants of commutative entries and at the left side is a column determinant whose entries are (corrections of) non-commuting vector fields, so called polarization operators. 

There are numerous generalizations.

## Statement

Define the polarization operators $E_{i j} = \sum_{a=1}^n x_{i a}\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{j a}}$ for $i,j\in\{1,\ldots n\}$. These operators satisfy the commutation relations of the Lie algebra $gl(n)$.

Define the column determinant of a matrix $A = (a_{i j})_{i,,j=1,\ldots,n}$ with not necessarily commuting entries 
$$
det_c(A) = \sum_{\sigma\in\Sigma(n)}sign(\sigma) 
a_{\sigma(1)1}a_{\sigma(2)2}\cdots a_{\sigma(n)n}
$$
This is in generally an ill-behaved object of comparing to the case of the [[determinant]] of a matrix with commuting entries; in particular the other formulas for a determinant give different results in noncommutative case.
Then
$$
det_c((E_{i j} - (n-i)\delta_{i j})_{i j}) = det((x_{i j})_{i j}) det((\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{i j}})_{i j})
$$
