## Idea

The basic example of subtraction is, of course, the partial operation in the monoid of natural numbers or in the integers. It is often the first illustration of a non-associative operation met in abstract algebra. We think of subtraction as an operation $s:\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{Z}\to \mathbb{Z}$, where, of course, $s(m,n)=m-n$.

There are numerous related abstractions of this, relating to different aspects of the basic operation.

## Definition

1. (Universal Algebra) In the sense of Ursini  in the context of a varietal theory,  a _subtraction term_, $s$, is a binary term $s$ satisfying $s(x, x) = 0$ and $s(x, 0) = x$.
(see [[subtractive variety]]

1. In a [[co-Heyting algebra]], subtraction is the operation [[left adjoint]] to the [[join]] operator:
$$ (- \setminus y) \dashv (y \vee -)$$

This is related to [[subtractive logic]].
