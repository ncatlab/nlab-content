##Â Definition ##

A [[graph|directed loop graph]] can be thought of as a [[set]] $V$ of [[vertices]] and a [[binary endorelation]] $\to$, the edge relation of $V$, where given vertices $a:V$ and $b:V$, each [[proposition]] $p:a \to b$ that is [[true]] is an [[edge]] between $a$ and $b$. 

The directed loop graph $V$, equivalently the binary endorelation $\to$, is **dense** if for every pair of vertices $a:V$ and $b:V$ with an edge $a \to b$, there exists a vertex $c:V$ with edges $a \to c$ and $c \to b$.
