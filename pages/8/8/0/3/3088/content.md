[[!redirects Internal ∞-groupoid]]
The [[Kan complex]] definition of [[∞-groupoid]] immediately generalizes to an arbitrary category. Namely, if $C$ is a cetegory, a ∞-$C$-groupoid is a Kan object in $C$, i.e., a [[simplicial object]] in $C$ which satisfies the Kan conditions. In this sense, an ∞-groupoid is a ∞-$Sets$-groupoid. 

Classical examples are topological ∞-groupoids. The [[nerve]] construction makes a topological ∞-groupoid from a topological groupoid. This is actually a characterization of topological groupoids among topological categories.

In particular, if $G$ is a topological group, then $N(\mathbf{B}G)$ is a topological ∞-groupoid. This is relevant to the construction of the [[classifying space]]s for continuous [[principal bundle]]s.

Another classical example are ∞-Lie-groupoids.
