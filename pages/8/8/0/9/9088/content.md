## Idea

A [[regular scheme]] $(X,\mathcal{O}_X)$ is an [[algebraic scheme]] such that for every $x\in X$ there exists an affine open neighbourhood $U\subset X$ of $x$ such that the ring $\mathcal{O}_X(U)$ is regular (many authors also require Noetherian). Equivalently, [[stalk]] $\mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ of the structure sheaf $\mathcal{O}_X$ at any point $x\in X$ (as a locally ringed space) is a [[regular local ring]].
