## Idea

A **strict factorization system** is like an [[orthogonal factorization system]], but the factorizations are specified uniquely on the nose, rather than merely up to [[isomorphism]].

One reason these are of interest is that they can be identified with [[distributive laws]] in the [[bicategory]] of [[spans]], as shown by [Rosebrugh & Wood](#RosebrughWood).


Ordinary orthogonal factorization systems can be similarly characterized by:

* using [[wreaths]] as in [this paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022404902001378);

* using a type of [[pseudo distributive law]], as in the above paper;

* by working in the bicategory of [[profunctors]] instead, as in [this paper](http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/13/9/13-09abs.html) (see also [[factorization system over a subcategory]]); or by

* using [[weak distributive law]]s, as in [this paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.0732).
