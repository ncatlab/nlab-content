## Idea

A **strict factorization system** is like an [[orthogonal factorization system]], but the factorizations are specified uniquely on the nose, rather than merely up to [[isomorphism]].

## Definition

A **strict factorization system** on a category $C$ comprises [[wide subcategories]] $E$ and $M$ of $C$ such that every morphism in $C$ factors *uniquely* (not just uniquely up to unique isomorphism) as $m e$ for $e \in E$ and $m \in M$.

Note that a strict factorization system is not necessarily an [[orthogonal factorization system]], since $E$ and $M$ may not contain the isomorphisms in $C$. However, for every strict factorization system, there is a unique orthogonal factorization system containing it, given by closing $E$ under postcomposition by isomorphisms and closing $M$ under precomposition by isomorphisms (see §2.1 of [Grandis (2000)](#Grandis00)).

## Examples

* Every category has two "trivial" strict factorization systems in which $E$, respectively $M$, consists of the [[identity morphisms]] only.  The corresponding orthogonal factorization systems are those with one class consisting of the isomorphisms.

* Part of the structure of a (non-generalized) [[Reedy category]] is a strict factorization system.

* The category [[Set]], as defined in a [[material set theory]], has a strict factorization system consisting of the surjections and the inclusions of [[subsets]].  Its associated orthogonal factorization system consists of surjections and [[injections]].  Other categories built out of structured sets have similar strict factorization systems.

## As distributive laws in a bicategory

One reason strict factorization systems are of interest is that they can be identified with [[distributive laws]] in the [[bicategory]] of [[spans]], as shown by [Rosebrugh & Wood (2002)](#RosebrughWood02).

Ordinary orthogonal factorization systems can be similarly characterized by:

* using a type of relaxed [[distributive law]], as in [Rosebrugh & Wood (2002)](#RosebrughWood02);

* using [[wreaths]] as in [Lack & Street (2002)](#LackStreet02);

* by working in the [[bicategory]] of [[profunctors]] instead, as in [Lack (2004)](#Lack04) (see also [[factorization system over a subcategory]]); or by

* using [[weak distributive laws]], as in [Böhm (2012)](#Böhm12).
