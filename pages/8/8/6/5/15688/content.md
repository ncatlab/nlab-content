Given a [[symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category]] $\mathcal{C}$ then one may consider [[E-∞ space]]-objects inside it.

If the monoidal structure happens to be Cartesian then one may ask for "more" commutativity than that. [[Jacob Lurie]] called that "very commutative" ([MO comment](http://mathoverflow.net/a/118528/381))

(should come down to whether one interprets commutative monoids as a 1-[[algebraic theory]] or an [[(∞,1)-algebraic theory]], i.e. [[(2,1)-algebraic theory of E-infinity algebras]])
