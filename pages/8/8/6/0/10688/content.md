## Idea

The _EHP spectral sequence_ (we follow [Mahowald 85](#Mahowald85)) is the [[spectral sequence]] for computation of [[homotopy groups of spheres]] induced from the [[filtration]] of the underlying homotopy type $\Omega^\infty \Sigma^\infty S^0 = \Omega^\infty \mathbb{S}$  of the [[sphere spectrum]]  by [[suspensions]] (German: _E_inh&#228;ngung):

$$
  \Omega^n S^n \stackrel{E}{\longrightarrow} \Omega^{n+1} S^{n+1}
  \,.
$$

More concretely, ([James 57](#James57)) constructed maps

$$
  \Omega S^n \stackrel{H}{\longrightarrow} \Omega S^{2n-1}
$$

(for _H_opf as in [[Hopf invariant]]) and showed that  [[p-localization|2-locally]] these fit with $E$ into [[homotopy fiber sequences]] 

$$
  \Omega^{n+2} S^{2n+1} 
    \stackrel{P}{\longrightarrow}
  \Omega^n S^n 
    \stackrel{E}{\longrightarrow} 
  \Omega^{n+1} S^{n+1}
    \stackrel{H}{\longrightarrow}
  \Omega^{n+1}S^{2n+1}
  \,.
$$


This "EHP-[[long homotopy fiber sequence]]" gives rise to the corresponding [[long exact sequence of homotopy groups]] and so to an [[exact couple]] of the form

$$
  \array{
     \underset{s,t}{\oplus} \pi_{s+t}(\Omega^{s+1}S^{s+1})
     && \stackrel{i}{\longrightarrow} &&
     \pi_{s+t}(\Omega^{s+1}S^{s+1})
     \\
     & \nwarrow && \swarrow
     \\
     &&
     \underset{s,t}{\oplus} 
     \pi_{t+s}(\Omega^{s+1}S^{2s+1})
  }
  \,.
$$

The corresponding [[spectral sequence]] is the EHP spectral sequence proper. It converges, 2-locally, to the [[stable homotopy groups of spheres]], with $E_1$-page given by

$$
  E^{k,n}_1 = \pi_{k+n}(S^{2n-1}) \;\Rightarrow\; \pi_\bullet^{\mathbb{S}}
  \,.
$$

For more general [[prime numbers]] than just 2, ([Toda 62](#Toda62)) found analogous fibrations, which hence give EHP spectral sequences for general $p$.


The EHP spectral sequence is often used used in the context of the [[Adams-Novikov spectral sequence]] for [[p-localization]] at some prime $p$.

## Constructions of $H$

For James' fiber sequence, the essential property required of $H$ is to realize the isomorphism
$$ (the\:map\:H)^{cohomology\:pullback} : H^{2n}(\Omega\mathbb{S}^{2n+1})\overset{\sim}{\to} H^{2n}(\Omega \mathbb{S}^{n+1}) .$$
The remaining corollaries then follow using the fact cohomology pullback is a ring homomorphism, and the $mod 2$ [[Leray-Serre spectral sequence]].

### Via the James model

Using the James model of $\Omega\Sigma X$ as a quotient space of $colim_n X^n $, a candidate $H$ is constructed by recursion:
$$ H([x_0 , \dots, x_{n+1}]) = H([x_0,\dots,x_n]) \# ([x_0 \wedge x_{n+1} , \dots , x_n\wedge x_{n+1}]) $$
where $\#$ denotes concatenation and $\wedge$ [[smash product]].  One checks that the ordering of product terms $ x_i\wedge x_j $ w.r.t. $x_k\wedge x_l$ depends only on the relative orders of $i,j,k,l$, so that $H$ is well-defined on the quotient space $\Omega\Sigma X \to \Omega \Sigma(X\wedge X)$.

In particular, the restriction to $J_2 X$ factors through $ X\wedge X \to \Omega\Sigma X\wedge X$ as the cofiber of the inclusion $X \to J_2 X$.  In the case $X\simeq \mathbb{S}^n$, the desired cohomology isomorphism is immediate.
