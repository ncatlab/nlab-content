Quantum Yang-Baxter equation has been proposed by Baxter in the context of a particular model of statistical mechanics (6-vertex model ??) and called star-triangle relation. Later it has been generalized and axiomatized to a number of contexts: it is most notably satisfied by the universal R-element in a [[quasitriangular Hopf algebra]]. In some context it is equivalent to a braid relation for certain transposed matrix. The solution to a quantum Yang-Baxter equation for matrices is called the quantum Yang-Baxter matrix or quantum R-matrix; some solutions to quantum Yang-Baxter equation have good limits in classical mechanics which are [[classical r-matrices]], and the latter satisfy the classical Yang-Baxter equation.
