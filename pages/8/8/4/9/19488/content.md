## Idea

The concept of _formal smooth set_ is a kind of [[generalized space]] generalizing _[[smooth sets]]_ from plain [[differential geometry]] to differential geometry equipped with explicit [[infinitesimal spaces]], hence to [[synthetic differential geometry]]. Just as a [[smooth set]] is equivalently a [[sheaf]] on the [[site]] of [[Cartesian spaces]], so a _formal smooth set_ is a [[sheaf]] on the [[site]] of [[formal Cartesian spaces]], hence of [[Cartesian products]] of [[Cartesian spaces]] with [[infinitesimally thickened points]]. The resulting [[sheaf topos]] is also known as _Dubuc's [[Cahiers topos]]_.

For the moment, for more see at _[[geometry of physics]]_ the chapters _[[geometry of physics -- manifolds and orbifolds|manifolds and orbifolds]]_ and _[[geometry of physics -- supergeometry]]_.
