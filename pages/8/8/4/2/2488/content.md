An _$n$-truncated object of an [[∞-stack]] [[(∞,1)-topos]]_ is the anaolog of a [[homotopy n-type]] in the archetypical [[(∞,1)-topos]] [[∞-Grpd]]/[[Top]]: 

it is an object $X$ whose [[homotopy group (of an ∞-stack)|homotopy groups (of an ∞-stack)]] $\pi_k(X)$ are trivial for $k \gt n$.

###### Definition
**($n$-truncated $\infty$-groupoid)**

An [[∞-groupoid]] $A$ is **$n$-truncated** if it is an [[n-groupoid]]:

Precisely: in the model of [[∞-groupoid]]-groupoids given by [[Kan complex]]es an [[∞-groupoid]] is **$n$-truncated** if, the [[simplicial homotopy group]]s $\pi_k(A,x)$ are trivial for all $x$ and all $k \gt n$.

Let $C$ be an [[(∞,1)-category]]. For $X,A$ objects in $C$ write $C(X,A) \in $ [[? Grpd]] for the [[(∞,1)-categorical hom-space]] (if $C$ is given as a [[simplicially enriched category]] then this is just the [[SSet]]-[[hom-object]] which is guaranteed to be a [[Kan complex]]).

## in terms of homotopy groups ##

That an object $X$ is $n$-truncated precisely when its [[homotopy group (of an ∞-stack)|homotopy groups (of an ∞-stack)]] $\pi_k(X)$ are trivial for $k \gt n$ is the content of [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT prop 6.5.1.7]].


#Terminology#

* A 0-truncated object is also called _discrete_ . Notice that this is _categorically discrete_ as in [[discrete category]], not discrete in the sense of [[topological space]]s. An object in an [[(∞,1)-topos]] is discrete in this sense if, regarded as an [[∞-groupoid]] with extra structure it has only trivial morphisms.
