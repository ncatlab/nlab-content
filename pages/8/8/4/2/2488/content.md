An _$n$-truncated object of an $(\infinity,1)$-topos_ is the anaolog of a [[homotopy n-type]] in the archetypical [[(∞,1)-topos]] [[∞-Grpd]]/[[Top]].

#Definition#

An _$n$-truncated object of an $(\infinity,1)$-topos_ $\mathbf{H}$ is an object $X$ such that all of its [[homotopy group of object in an (infinity,1)-topos|homotopy groups of objects in an (∞,1)-topos]] above degree $n$ vanish.
