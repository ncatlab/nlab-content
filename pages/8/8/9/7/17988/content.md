## Idea

In the context of [[quantum field theory]] (QFT) the term _asymptotic safety_ ([Weinstein 79](#Weinstein79)) refers to the situation where a QFT may not be [[renormalization|renormalizable]], but its [[renormalization group flow]] has a [[non-perturbative effect|non-perturbative]] [[fixed point]].

> One defines the "UV-critical hypersurface" as the set of all those points in the infinite-dimensional theory space which are "pulled" into the fixed point by the inverse RG flow: trajectories lying in this surface approach the fixed point for increasing momentum scales. General arguments and known examples suggest that the UV-critical hypersurface has a finite dimensionality. This dimensionality equals the number of (infrared-) relevant couplings, i.e. couplings which get attracted to the fixed point in the UV. The important point is that once the value of these (few) couplings are known at some scale all other (irrelevant) couplings are fixed by requiring an asymptotically safe theory, that is a trajectory which lies entirely in the UV-critical hypersurface. By this means we achieve that, first, the couplings are determined by a finite number of measurements rendering the theory predictive, and, second, the UV behavior is unproblematic without any unphysical divergences. ([Nink-Reuter 12, p. 2](#NinkReuter12))

A key example of a non-renormalizable QFT is [[Einstein gravity]], and there is speculation that it might be asymptotically safe, and that this might be the solution to the construction of [[quantum gravity]].
