A stable $\infty$-category is an [[infinity-category]] whose [[object]]s behave like homotopy-theoretic [[spectrum|spectra]].

A detailed theory for stable $\infty$-categories exists for the case of [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categories]]:
see [[stable (infinity,1)-category]].

This type of stability is not to be confused with being stably (or symmetric) [[k-tuply monoidal n-category|monoidal]].
