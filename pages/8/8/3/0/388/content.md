The word _homotopy_ is used for different but closely related notions:

* [[homotopy (as a transformation)]] denotes the transformation between two continuous maps between [[topological spaces]], i.e. a [[2-morphism]] in the [[(infinity,1)-category]] [[Top]] -- or more generally any [[2-morphism]] in any [[(infinity,1)-category]], often modeled as a (left or right) homotopy in a [[model category]] or [[category of fibrant objects]];

* [[homotopy (as an operation)]] denotes the operation (the [[functor]]) of assigning [[homotopy group]]s to spaces in [[Top]] or, more generally, to objects in an [[(infinity,1)-topos]].

The latter operation involves taking equivalence relations with respect to the former transformation.
