An $A_\infty$-ring is a [[monoid in an (∞,1)-category]] for the [[stable (∞,1)-category of spectra]]. Sometimes this is called an [[associative ring spectrum]].

This may be modeled equivalently as an ordinary [[monoid]] with respect to the [[symmetric monoidal smash product of spectra]].

Notice the difference to an ordinary [[ring spectrum]] which which is not necessarily coherently homotopy-associative.

$A_\infty$-rings play the role of [[ring]]s in [[higher algebra]].

The higher analog of a commutative ring is an [[E-∞ ring]].
