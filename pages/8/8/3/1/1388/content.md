An __$A_\infty$-ring__ is an [[algebra over an operad]] over the [[A-infinity operad]] in [[chain complex]]es of [[abelian group]]s.

This should be the same thing as an [[associative ring spectrum]].

It seems that it should be true that an associative ring spectrum is equivalently 

* an algebra over some [[A-infinity operad]] in chain complexes of abelian groups;

* an algebra object in the monoidal $(\infty,1)$-category of spectra. 

I am still trying to find out to which degree both definitions are equivalent.

See also the discussion at [[E-infinity ring]].
