## Idea

The _analytic topology_ on an  [[complex analytic space]] is the one given by [[covering]] the space by affine opens equipped with the standard [[topology]] induced from that of the [[complex numbers]] $\mathbb{C}^n$.

## Properties

### Riemann existence theorem

* [[Riemann existence theorem]]

### Comparison theorem

[[Chow's theorem]] states that a projective [[complex analytic variety]], hence a closed analytic subspace of a complex [[projective space]], is also an [[algebraic variety]] over the [[complex numbers]]. In general this is not true.

The [[comparison theorem (étale cohomology)]] relates the [[étale cohomology]] of a [[complex variety]] with the [[ordinary cohomology]] of its complex analytic topological space.

For more along such lines see at _[[GAGA]]_.
