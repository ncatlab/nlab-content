#Idea#

(...something like "[[Lie algebroid]] internal to Lie algebroids", but subtle...)

#Definition#

Given a [[Lie algebroid]] $A$ together with the structure of a [[Lie algebroid]] $A^*$ on the dual of the vector bundle underlying $A$, the interpretation of a Lie algebroids as a [[supermanifold]] as described at [[Lie infinity-algebroid]] induces two notions of differentials $d_A$ and $d_{A^*}$ and two notions of Schouten brackets. 

A pairs $(A,A^*)$ of Lie algebroids is a **Lie bialgebroid** if these differentials are derivations of the corresponding Schouten brackets.

See for instance [definition 2.2.2](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/math/pdf/9910/9910078v1.pdf#page=15) in _Roytenberg99_.

#Remarks#

* Every Lie bialgebroid $(A,A*)$ induces the structure of a [[Courant algebroid]] on $E := A \oplus A^*$. This is [theorem 2.3.3](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/math/pdf/9910/9910078v1.pdf#page=18) in _Roytenberg99_.
For $A = T X$ the tangent Lie algebroid of a manifold $X$, this is the crucial fact underlying [[generalized complex geometry]].
