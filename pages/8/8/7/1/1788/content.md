## Idea

Any [[free loop space]] $\mathcal{L}X$ has a canonical [[action]] ([[infinity-action]]) of the [[circle group]] $S^1$. The [[homotopy quotient]] $\mathcal{L}(X)/S^1$ of this action might be called the _cyclic loop space_ of $X$, and is also known as the *string space* of $X$ ([Chataur 2005. 4.8.1](#Chataur05), [B&ouml;kstedt & Ottosen 05, p. 1](#BokstedtOttosen05)).

If $X = Spec(A)$ is an [[affine variety]] regarded in [[derived algebraic geometry]], then $\mathcal{O}(\mathcal{L}Spec(A))$ is the [[Hochschild homology]] of $A$ and $\mathcal{O}((\mathcal{L}Spec(A))/S^1)$ the corresponding [[cyclic homology]], see the discussion at _[[Hochsc hild cohomology]]_.
 
If $X = Y\sslash G$ is the [[homotopy quotient]] of a [[topological space]] by a [[topological group]] action, regarded as a locally constant $\infty$-stack, then (a [[point-set topology|point set]]-model for) the [[free loop space]] $\mathcal{L}(Y \sslash G)$ has been called the *twisted loop space* in [Witten 88](#Witten88); and this terminology is essentially carried over to the cyclification of its restriction to the constant loops 
[Stapleton (2013), p. 2](#Stapleton13) in the context of the [[transchromatic character]].

A candidate lift of this construction from plain [[homotopy types]] to [[smooth homotopy types]], namely to [[orbifold]] [[stacks]] is [[Huan's inertia orbifold]]-construction.


## Properties

### As right base change along $\ast \to \mathbf{B} S^1$
 {#AsRightBaseChange}

The cyclic loop space $\mathcal{L}X  \sslash S^1$ is equivalently the right [[base change]]/[[dependent product]] along the canonical point inclusion $\ast \to B S^1$ ([this prop.](base+change#CyclicLoopSpace)) into the [[delooping]] of $S^1$ (the [[classifying space]] of the [[circle group]] when realized in the [[classical model structure on topological spaces|homotopy theory of]] [[topological spaces]]). See also at _[[double dimensional reduction]]_ ([BMSS 19, Sec. 2.2](#BMSS19), following [FSS 18, Sec. 3](#FSS18)).
