$$
  f \;\colon\; X \overset{et}{\longrightarrow} Y
$$

if $f$ if for each [[infinitesimally thickened smooth manifold|infinitesimally thickened Cartesian space]] (def. \ref{InfinitesimallyThickendSmoothManifold}) $\mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{D}$ we have a natural identification between the $\mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{D}$-plots of $X$ with those $\mathbb{R}^n \tiimes \mathbb{D}$-plots of $Y$ whose [[reduction modality|reduction]] (def. \ref{ReductionAndInfinitesimalShape}) comes from an $\mathbb{R}^n$-plot of $X$, hence if we have a [[fiber product]]
