\begin{proposition}
\label{EquivalenceBetweenStrengthAndEnrichment}
**(equivalence between $V$-strength and $V$-enrichment)**
For 

* $V$ a [[closed monoidal category]]

* $\mathbf{C}$, $\mathbf{D}$ a [[pair]] of $V$-[[enriched categories]]

  which are also $V$-[[tensoring|tensored]] (=[[copower|copowered]]) 

then there is a [[bijection]] between

* $V$-[[strong functors]] and $V$-[[enriched functors]] $\mathbf{C} \to \mathbf{D}$

and for any pair $F$, $G$ of such a [[bijection]] between

* $V$-[[strong natural transformations]] and $V$-[[enriched natural transformation]] $F \to G$

It follows in particular that there is a [[bijection]] between

* $V$-[[strong monads]] and $V$-[[enriched monads]]

on such $\mathbf{C}$.
\end{proposition}
([McDermott & Uustalu 2022, Prop. 5.4, 5.8](#McDermottUustalu22))

\begin{remark}
  For $V$ a [[closed monoidal category]] the further assumptions in Prop. \ref{EquivalenceBetweenStrengthAndEnrichment} apply to $\mathbf{C} = \mathbf{D} \coloneqq \mathbf{V}$ being the canonical self-enrichment of $V$.
\end{remark}
