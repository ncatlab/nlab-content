The biggest threat to a good idea are often its proponents, or those who vocally appear to be. 

String theory originated in the 1960s as a conceptual strategy for understanding experimental observations about strongly-interacting fundamental particles, notably the [[confinement]] of "[[quarks]]" inside [[hadrons]] and the "[[Regge trajectories]]" seen in [[hadron]] [[scattering]]. These are experimental phenomena exhibited by fairly ordinary [[matter]] (all [[atomic nuclei]] are [[bound states]] of [[hadrons]]), and yet (despite frequent advertisement of the success of the [[standard model of particle physics]]) understanding them properly remains an open problem to this day, to the extent that one speaks of a "[Millennium Problem](mass+gap#ReferencesMassGapProblem)".

However, a saga of 5 decades of intellectual twists and sociological turns later, string theorists as a swarm community largely forgot about the glaring question why quarks are never seen in isolation and somehow ended up, in the 2000s, instead convincing themselves and the public that string theory's  prime contribution to physics is to suggest the imminent detection of "[[squarks]]" at the [[LHC]]-experiment commencing in 2010. The failure of this alleged prediction to materialize is increasingly leading to the sensation of a failure of "string theory". 

In reality, this should be a chance to go back to the roots and re-assess string theory as a candidate for the elusive theory of strongly-interacting matter systems, both in [[high energy physics]] --- concerning [[quantum hadrodynamics]] in [[QCD]] --- as well as in [[solid-state physics]] --- notably concerning [[topological order|topologically ordered]] [[quantum materials]] ---, both controlled by a "[[mass gap]]"-phenomenon and both still related to [[quantum gravity]] via [[holography]].

This is the role of string theory that [[Alexander Polyakov]]  [originally envisioned](AdS-CFT+correspondence#PolyakovGaugeStringDualityReferences). The logic here proceeds in the following steps (cf. [Polyakov (2007), ยง1](#Polyakov07)):

1. **flux tubes confine as dynamical strings**

   The starting point is the [[hypothesis]] that the strong coupling of particles (such as [[quarks]]) by a (non-abelian) [[gauge fields]] (such as the [[strong nuclear force]]) is embodied by the formation of "[[flux tubes]]" ("[[Wilson lines]]") between pairs of such particles, which in themselves behave like [[strings]] with a given [[tension]].

   &lbrack;[Kogut & Susskind (1974)](#KogutSusskind74), [(1975)](#KogutSusskind75); [Wilson (1974)](#Wilson74); [Polyakov (1979)](#Polyakov79), [(1980)](#Polyakov80), [(1987)](#Polyakov80); [Makeenko & Migdal (1981)](#MakeenkoMigdal81)&rbrack;

   Under this assumption it would be:

   1. the [[flux tube]]/[[string]]'s [[tension]] which keeps the particles at theirs endpoints [[confinement|confined]], 

   1. the excitation of these [[flux tubes]]/[[strings]] which follow [[Regge trajectories]] (such as of [[hadrons]]);

   1. the [[scattering]] of these [[flux tubes]]/[[strings]] which explains the observed [[Veneziano amplitudes]],

   which are the main qualitative features to be explained.

1. **quantum flux tubes probe effective higher dimensions**

   But if so, quantum effects make such [[flux tubes]]/[[strings]] behave like propagating in an effective higher-dimensional spacetime &lbrack;[Polyakov (1981)](#Polyakov81)&rbrack;,

   with only their endpoints constrained to lie in the original lower dimensional spacetime which now appears as a "[[brane]]" inside a higher dimensional [[bulk]] spacetime.

   &lbrack;[Polyakov (1998)](#Polyakov98), [(1999)](#Polyakov98)&rbrack;

1. **large $N$ confined gauge theory is holographic string theory**

   Thus the description of strongly coupled matter via flux tubes/string now reveals a [[holography|holographic]] property where strongly-coupled quantum fields on [[intersecting brane models|intersecting branes]] are equivalently described by a [[quantum gravity]] of [[strings]] propagating in a higher dimensional [[bulk]].

   (Notice that in this picture, even to the extent that the approximation of [[AdS/CFT correspondence]] applies, observable physics takes place *on the brane* ([[underlying]] which is typically flat [[Minkowski spacetime]]!) at the [[asymptotic boundary]] of the bulk spacetime, while the (potentially large) extra dimensions of a possibly $\sim$ [[AdS]]-bulk remain primarily unobservable.)

1. **small $N$ confined gauge theory is holographic M-theory**

   While this dual bulk string theory is itself strongly-coupled unless the "number of coincident branes" is humongous (the "[[large-N limit]]") and thus unrealistic after all, now there are more concrete hints as to its strongly-coupled (non-perturbative) completion, going under the working title *[[M-theory]]*.

In summary, the plausible approach of understanding strongly-coupled quantum gauge theories by regarding their [[flux tubes]] as dynamical [[strings]] seems to recast the [Millennium Problem](mass+gap#ReferencesMassGapProblem) of understanding strongly-coupled matter into the problem of formulating [[M-theory]]: Given [[M-theory]], it ought to be possible to find [[intersecting brane models]] of single (or a small number of [[coincident branes|coincident]]) [[M-branes]] (such as the *[Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model](AdS-QCD+correspondence#WittenSakaiSugimotoModel)* [[M5-brane]] system) on whose [[worldvolume]] the desired strongly-coupled field theory is realized (such as [[QCD]]).
