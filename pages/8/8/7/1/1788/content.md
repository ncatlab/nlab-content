The key open question of contemporary mathematical physics is the elucidation of the currently elusive fundamental laws of "non-perturbative" states --- ranging from bound states as mundane as nucleons but more generally of quarks confined inside hadrons (declared a mathematical "Millennium Problem" by the Clay Math Institute), over topologically ordered quantum materials (currently sought by various laboratories), all the way to the ultimate goal of fundamentally understanding background-free quantum gravity and "grand unification". Now, the foremost non-perturbative effect in physics is "flux quantization"; and I begin by explaining in detail how this finds its natural mathematical definition in differential cohesive homotopy theory. By going through key examples --- as a fun exercise in cohesive homotopy theory --- I explain how to systematically derive from this: 1. magnetic flux quantization (experimentally seen in superconductors), and then by just the same logic: 2. the widely expected *Hypothesis K* that "RR-flux" is quantized in topological K-theory, and in evident non-abelian generalization: 3. our novel *Hypothesis H* that "$G_{4,7}$-flux" is quantized in unstable Cohomotopy (i.e.: framed Cobordism). Depending on time and interest, I close by indicating (A) how coupling to gravity enhances these flux quantization laws to *T*wisted & *E*quivariant & *D*ifferential (TED) refinements of these cohomology theories and (B) how *Hypothesis H* explains anyonic topological order controlled by KZ-monodromy in bundles of conformal blocks.
