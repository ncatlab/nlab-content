The reasoning that made [Bénabou 1967](#Bénabou67) adopt the term *monad* seems to be lost to history. The closest contemporary account that seems to exist, [Barr 2009](#Barr09), only recalls the following event, on the backdrop of a widely felt dissatisfaction with the earlier terminology "standard construction" and "triple":

> In the summer (or maybe late spring, the Oberwohlfach records will show this) of 1966, there was a category meeting there. &lbrack;...&rbrack; One day at lunch or dinner I happened to be sitting next to Jean Benabou and he turned to me and said something like "How about `monad'?" I thought about and said it sounded pretty good to me.  (Yes, I did.)  So Jean proposed it to the general audience and there was general agreement.

On the other hand (as maybe alluded to in the first line of [Barr 2009](#Barr09)) [[Leibniz]]'s old [terminology of "monads"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monadology) had, a few years earlier, been adopted in [[nonstandard analysis]] as the term for *[[infinitesimal neighbourhoods]]* ([Luxembourg 1966](#infinitesimal+neighborhood#Luxemburg66), compare also [Keisler 1976, Def. 1.2](infinitesimal+neighborhood#Keisler76), [Kutateladze 2011](infinitesimal+neighborhood#Kutateladze11) and, speaking [[synthetic differential geometry]]: [Kock 1980](infinitesimal+neighborhood#Kock80)).

Now it so happens --- in the [[topos theory|topos theoretic]] formulation of [[infinitesimals]] via [[differential cohesion]] --- that the construction of [[infinitesimal neighbourhoods]] *is* (see [here](infinitesimal+disk+bundle#MonadicityAdjointToJetBundles)) a monad in the sense of [[category theory]]! -- namely the [[left adjoint|left]] [[adjoint monad]] to the [[jet comonad]] ([Khavkine & Schreiber 2017, p. 23](infinitesimal+disk+bundle#KhavkineSchreiber17)).
