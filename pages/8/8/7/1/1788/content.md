>Platonic idealism, while mistaken on the relation between consciousness and matter, contains an aspect of truth when applied within the realm of ideas; for example, the doctrine of algebraic theories begins with the affirmation that there exists as a definite mathematical object the “perfect idea of a group” A of which the idea of any particular group is “merely an imperfect representation”. (Indeed, it is a simple further step to form as a mathematical object the “idea of an algebraic theory” of which any particular algebraic theory A is a representation, as was carried out as a part of Bénabou’s 1966 dissertation); of course, even here Platonic idealism is wrong on the order of development, since the ideas of several particular groups were concentrated from practice well before the idea of a group in general was concentrated from the practice of mathematicians around 1800.

>The often repeated slander that mathematicians think
"as if" they were "platonists" needs to be combatted rather than swallowed. What mathematicians and other scientists use is the objectively developed human
instrument of general concepts. (The plan to misleadingly use that fact as a support for philosophical idealism may have been an
honest mistake by Plato, or it may have been part of his job as disinformation officer for the Athenian CIA organization; it probably would not have survived until now had it not been for the special efforts of Cosimo de' Medici.)
It seems that a general concept has two related aspects, as I began to realize more explicitly in connection with my paper Adjointness infoundations, Dialectica vol. 23, 1969 281-296; I later learned that some philosophers refer to these two aspects as "abstract general vs. concrete general". For example, there is the algebraic theory of rings  vs. the category of all rings, or a particular abstract group  vs. the category of all
permutation representations of the group. While it is "obvious" that, at least in mathematics, a concrete general should have the structure of a category, because all the instances embody the same abstract general and hence any two instances can be compared in preferred ways, by contrast it was not until the late fifties that one realized that an abstract general can also be construed as a category in its own right. That
realization essentially made explicit the fact that substitution is a logical operation and indeed is the most fundamental logical operation.
Thus an abstract general is essentially a special
algebraic structure indeed a category with additional structure such as finite limits or
still richer doctrines. As with other algebraic
structures there are again two aspects, the structures themselves and their presentations which are closely related, yet quite distinct; for example,
more than one presentation may be needed for efficient calculations determining features of the same algebraic structure. What is meant by a presentation depends
on the doctrine: for example Delta as a mere category has an infinite presentation used in topology, but as a strict monoidal category it has a finite presentation.

>In my 1972 Perugia Notes I had made an attempt to characterize the relation between these sorts of mathematical considerations and philosophy by saying that while platonism is wrong on the relation between Thinking and Being, something analogous is correct WITHIN the realm of Thinking. The relevant dialectic there is between abstract general and concrete general. Not concrete particular ("concrete" here does not mean "real").
There is another crucial dialectic making particulars (neither abstract nor concrete) give rise to an abstract general; since experiments do not mechanically give rise to theory, it is harder to give a purely mathematical outline of how that dialectic works, though it certainly does work. A mathematical model of it can be based on the hypothesis that a given set of particulars is somehow itself a category (or graph), i.e., that the appropriate ways of comparing the particulars are given but that their essence is not. Then their "natural structure" (analogous to cohomology operations) is an abstract general and the corresponding concrete general receives a Fourier-Gelfand-Dirac functor from the original particulars. That functor is usually not full because the real particulars are infinitely deep and the natural structure is computed with respect to some limited doctrine; the doctrine can be varied, or "screwed up or down" as James Clerk Maxwell put it, in order to see various
phenomena.
