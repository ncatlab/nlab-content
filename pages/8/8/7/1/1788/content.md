# Ultrafilter characterization of compactness {#sec:orge5f98d4}

## Proposition: the space $X$ is compact if and only if every ultrafilter on $X$ converges. {#sec:orgf925a2a}

$(\Leftarrow)$. Suppose first that there is an ultrafilter $\mathcal{U}$
on $X$ which has no limit point. Suppose there is a finite subcover of
$(U_x)_{x \in X}.$ Then there are $U_1, \dots, U_k$ such that
$\bigvee_{i \leq k} U_i = X$, so that
$|bigvee_{i \leq k U_i \in \mathcal{U}.$ Since the complement of
$\mathcal{U}$ is an ideal, some $U_j$ among the $U_1, \dots, U_k$ was in
$\mathcal{U}$, a contradiction.

Therefore, the cover $(U_x)_{x \in X}$ has no finite subcover.

$(\Rightarrow)$. Suppose that every ultrafilter converges but $X$ is not
compact.

Fix an open covering $(U_x)_{x \in X}$ of $X$ with no finite subcover.

For each finite subset $F \subseteq X$, let
$V_F \overset{\operatorname{df}}{=} \bigvee_{x \in F} U_x.$ The
collection $(V_F)_{F \underset{\operatorname{fin}}{\subseteq} X}$ is
closed under $V$. Expanding this collection to

$$\left(W_{F,Y} \overset{\operatorname{df}}{=} V_F \cap Y \right)_{F \underset{\operatorname{fin}}{\subseteq} X, Y \subseteq X}$$

yields an ideal.

Therefore, $\left(X \backslash W_{F,Y}\right)_{F,Y}$ is a filter which
is contained in some ultrafilter $\mathcal{V}$. By assumption, this
converges to some point $x \in X$. Therefore, $U_x \in \mathcal{V}.$ By
construction, $\mathcal{V}$ also contains $X \backslash U_x$. This means
$\mathcal{V}$ was not an ultrafilter, a contradiction.

## Models for $n$-image factorization

The following gives a sufficient condition for modeling [[n-image]] factorizations in some [[(∞,1)-toposes]] with particularly convenient presentation.

+-- {: .num_prop #nImageFactroizationModeledOnSimplicialPrsheaves}
###### Proposition

Let $C$ be a site with [[point of a topos|enough points]], so that the weak equivalences in $sPSh(C)_{\mathrm{loc}}$ are detected on [[stalks]] ([this prop.](model+structure+on+simplicial+presheaves#OverSiteWithEnoughPointsWeakEquivalencesDetectedOnStalks)). Then given a morphism of [[Kan complex]]-valued [[simplicial presheaves]]

$$
  f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ in $sPSh(C)
$$

such that both  $X$ and $Y$ are [[homotopy n-types|homotopy k-types]] for some finite $k \in \mathbb{N}$, then its [[n-image]] factorization in the [[(∞,1)-topos]] $L_{lwhe} sPSh(C)_{loc}$ for any $n \in \mathbb{N}$ is presented by any factorization $X \longrightarrow im_{n}(f) \longrightarrow Y$ in $sPSh(C)$ through some Kan-complex valued simplicial presheaf $im_n(f)$ such that for each object $U \in C$ the [[simplicial homotopy groups]] satisfy the following conditions:

1. $\pi_{\bullet \lt n}\left(X(U) \to (im_{n}(f))(U)\right)$ are [[isomorphisms]];

1. $\pi_n\left(X(U) \to (im_{n}(f))(U)\to Y(U)\right)$ is the [[(epi,mono) factorization]] of $\pi_n(f(U))$;

1. $\pi_{\bullet \gt n}\left((im_{n}(f))(U) \to Y(U)\right)$ are [[isomorphisms]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Evalutation on [[stalks]] is a [[filtered colimit]] which preserves the [[finite limits]] and [[finite colimits]] that go into the definition of [[simplicial homotopy groups]]. Therefore the global conditions assumed on the simplicial homotopy groups imply that the same kind of conditions holds for the stalkwise homotopy groups. These are the [[categorical homotopy groups in an infinity-topos|categorical homotopy groups]] in $L_{lwhe} sPSh(C)_{loc}$. By [this prop.](n-truncated+object+of+an+infinity-category#RecognizngnTuncationOnSimplicialHomotopyGroups) and [this def.](n-connected+object+of+an+infinity-topos#Connectedness) we may recognize $n$-truncation of morphisms on categorical homotopy groups (using the assumption that $X$ and $Y$ are $k$-truncated for some $k$). Therefore the claim now follows from the stalkwise [[long exact sequence of homotopy groups]].

=--

In order to appeal to prop. \ref{nImageFactroizationModeledOnSimplicialPrsheaves} we are interested in explicit models for $n$-image factorization of morphisms of [[Kan complexes]]. The following gives such for the special case that the the morphism of Kan complexes is the image under the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] of a [[chain map]] between [[chain complexes]].

+-- {: .num_remark #ChainComplexnPlusOneImageInDegreen}
###### Remark

Let $f_\bullet \colon V_\bullet \longrightarrow W_\bullet$
be a [[chain map]] between [[chain complexes]]

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, consider the abelian group

$$
  (im_{n+1}(f))_n
    \;\coloneqq\;
  coker(\,
     ker(\partial_V) \cap ker(f_n)
     \to
     V_n
  \,)
$$


For the following it is helpful to think of this abelian group in the following equivalent ways.

Define an [[equivalence relation]] on $V_n$ by

$$
  \left(
     v_n \sim v'_n
  \right)
  \;\Leftrightarrow\;
  \left(
    (\partial_V v_n = \partial_V v'_n)
    \;\text{and}\;
    (f_n(v_n) = f_n(v'_n))
  \right)
  \,.
$$

Then

$$
  (im_{n+1}(f))_n \simeq V_n/_\sim
$$

is equivalently the set of [[equivalence classes]] of this equivalence relation, which inherits abelian group structure since the eqivalence relation is linear.

This is because the equivalence relation says equivalently that

$$
  \left(
     v_n \sim v'_n
  \right)
  \;\Leftrightarrow\;
  \left(
    v_n - v'_n \;\in\; ker(\partial_V) \cap ker(f_n)
  \right)
$$

and hence is generated under linearity by

$$
  \left(
     v_n \sim 0
  \right)
  \;\Leftrightarrow\;
  \left(
    v_n  \in ker(\partial_V) \cap ker(f_n)
  \right)
  \,.
$$

Moreover, notice that the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]]

$$
  DK
  \;\colon\;
  Ch_{\bullet \geq 0}
    \longrightarrow
  KanCplx
$$

factors through [[globe|globular]] [[strict omega-groupoids]] ([here](Dold-Kan+correspondence#GlobularAndCubical)). An [[n-morphism]] in the [[strict omega-groupoid]] $DK(V_\bullet)$ is of the form

$$
  (v_{n-1})
    \overset{\phantom{AA}v_n\phantom{AA}}{\longrightarrow}
  (v_{n-1} + \partial v_n)
  \,.
$$

In terms of these morphisms the [[equivalence relation]] above says that two of them are equivalent precisely if

1. they are "[[parallel morphisms]]" in that they have the same [[source]] and [[target]];

1. they have the same image under $f$ in the [[n-morphisms]] of  $DK(W_\bullet)$.


This suggests yet another equivalent way to think of $(im_{n+1}(f))_n$: it is the [[disjoint union]] over the [[target]] $(n-1)$-cells in $V_{n-1}$ of the images under $f$ of the sets of $n$-cells from zero to that target:

$$
  (im_{n+1}(f))_n
   \simeq
   \underset{v_{n-1} \in V_{n-1}}{\sqcup}
    \left\{
      f_n(v_n) \vert v_n \in V_n \,\text{and}\,\partial v_n = v_{n-1}
    \right\}
  \,.
$$

###### Proposition

Let $f_\bullet \colon V_\bullet \longrightarrow W_\bullet$
be a [[chain map]] between [[chain complexes]] and let
$n \in \mathbb{N}$. Recall the abelian group
 $\underset{v_{n-1}}{\sqcup}\{f_n(v_n) \vert \partial v_n = v_{n-1}\}$ from remark \ref{ChainComplexnPlusOneImageInDegreen}.

The following [[diagram]] of [[abelian groups]]

    \right\}
     &\overset{  }{\longrightarrow}&

    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\partial_{V}}}
    &&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\partial_W}}
    \\
    \vdots && \vdots && \vdots
  }
$$


Moreover, the middle vertical sequence is a chain complex $im_{n+1}(f)_\bullet$, and hence the diagram gives a factorization of $f_\bullet$ into two chain maps

$$
  f_\bullet
   \;\colon\;
  V_\bullet \longrightarrow im_{n+1}(f)_\bullet \longrightarrow W_\bullet
  \,.
$$

Finally, this is a model for the [[n-image|(n+1)-image factorization]] of $f$ in that on [[homology groups]] the following holds:

1. $H_{\bullet \lt n}(V) \overset{\simeq}{\to} H_{\bullet \lt n}(im_{n+1}(f))$ are [[isomorphisms]];

1. $H_n(V) \to H_n(im_{n+1}(f)) \hookrightarrow H_n(W)$ is the [[image|image factorization]] of $H_n(f)$;

1. $H_{\bullet \gt n}(im_{n+1}(f)) \overset{\simeq}{\to} H_{\bullet \gt n}(W)$   are [[isomorphisms]].

## Differential concretification on contractibles

Let $\Sigma$ be a [[contractible topological space|contractible]] [[smooth manifold]].  Then there is a weak equivalence

$$

  (\mathbf{B}^p U(1)) \mathbf{Conn}(\Sigma)
  \,,
$$

from the inductively defined object from def. \ref{DifferentialConcretificationForCirclenConnectionsOnContractible} to the moduli object from def. \ref{ModuliOfnFormConnection}.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the assumption that $\Sigma$ is contractible, the Cech-direction of the Cech-Deligne double complex is trivial and so we have for all $U \in CartSp$ and $0 \leq k \leq p$ weak equivalences of the form

$$
  [\Sigma, \mathbf{B}^{p+1}U(1)_{conn^k}](U)
  \;\simeq\;
  DK\left(
    C^\infty(\Sigma \times U, U(1))
     \to
    \Omega^1(\Sigma \times U)
      \to
    \Omega^2(\Sigma \times U)
     \to
    \cdots
      \to
    \Omega^{p+1}(\Sigma \times U)
  \right)
$$

and

$$
  (\mathbf{B}^p U(1))\mathbf{Conn}(\Sigma)
    \simeq
  DK\left(
    C^\infty(\Sigma \times U, U(1))
     \to
    \Omega^{1,0}(\Sigma \times U)
     \to
    \Omega^{2,0}(\Sigma \times U)
      \to
    \cdots
      \to
    \Omega^{p+1,0}(\Sigma \times U)
  \right)
  \,.
$$


We claim now for all $k \leq p$ that

$$
  (\mathbf{B}^p U(1))\mathbf{Conn}_k(\Sigma)
    \simeq
  DK\left(
    C^\infty(\Sigma \times U, U(1))
     \to
    \Omega^{1,0}(\Sigma \times U)
     \to
    \cdots
     \to
    \Omega^{k,0}(\Sigma \times U)
     \to
    0
      \to
    \cdots
      \to
    0
  \right)
  \,.
$$

For $k = p$ this is the statement to be shown.
Hence we may now prove this by [[induction]].

It is manifestly true for $k = 0$. Hence suppose it is true for some $k \lt p$.  Observe then that

$$
  \sharp [\Sigma, \mathbf{B}^{p+1}U(1)_{conn^{k+1}}]
    \longrightarrow
  \sharp [\Sigma, \mathbf{B}^{p+1}U(1)_{conn^k}]
$$

is an objectwise Kan fibration, because so is $\mathbf{B}^{p+1}U(1)_{conn^{k+1}} \to \mathbf{B}^{p+1}U(1)_{conn^k}$ by def. \ref{TruncatedDelgneComplexes}, and both $[\Sigma,-]$ as well as $\sharp$ are right Quillen functors from $sPSh(C)$ with its global projective model structre to itself.

It follows ([this prop.](homotopy+pullback#HomotopyPullbackByOrdinaryPullback)) that the homotopy fiber product in question
is presented by the plain 1-categorical fiber product. Since $DK$ is right adjoint, this in turn is given by the degreewise fiber product of the corresponding chain complexes. By direct inspection this means that

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    &
    \sharp [ \Sigma, \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{B}^p U(1))_{conn_{k+1}} ]
      \underset{\sharp[\Sigma, \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{B}^p U(1))_{conn_k}]}{\times^h}
    (\mathbf{B}^p U(1))\mathbf{Conn}_k(\Sigma)
   \\
   & \simeq
   DK
   \left(
      C^\infty(\Sigma \times U, U(1))
        \to
      \Omega^{1,0}(\Sigma \times U)
        \to
      \cdots
        \to
      \Omega^{k,0}(\Sigma \times U)
        \to
      (\sharp \Omega^{k+1}(\Sigma \times -))(U)
        \to
      0
       \to
      \cdots
        \to
      0
   \right)
  \end{aligned}
$$

Hence we are now reduced to computing the $(p+1-k)$ image of

$$
  \array{
  DK
  (
    C^\infty(\Sigma \times U)
     &\to&
    \Omega^1(\Sigma \times U)

       &\to&
    \Omega^{k}(\Sigma \times U)
      &\to&
    \Omega^{k+1}(\Sigma \times U)
      &\to&
    0
      &\to&
    \cdots
      &\to&
    0
  )
  \\
    \downarrow
    &&
    \downarrow
    &&

  \\
   DK
   (
      C^\infty(\Sigma \times U, U(1))
        &\to&
      \Omega^{1,0}(\Sigma \times U)
        &\to&
      \cdots
        &\to&
      \Omega^{k,0}(\Sigma \times U)
        &\to&
      (\sharp \Omega^{k+1}(\Sigma \times -))(U)
        &\to&
      0
       &\to&
      \cdots
        &\to&
      0
   )
  }
$$

Observe that in degree $(p+1)-(k+1)$ the ordinary image is

$$
  im\left(
    \Omega^{k+1}(\Sigma \times U)
      \to
     (\sharp \Omega^{k+1}(\Sigma \times -))(U)
  \right)
   \simeq
  \Omega^{k+1,0}(\Sigma \times U)
$$

With this the induction follows by prop. \ref{nImageFactroizationModeledOnSimplicialPrsheaves} and prop. \ref{nImageFactorizationOnChainComplex}.
