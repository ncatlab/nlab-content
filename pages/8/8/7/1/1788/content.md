In dimensions $n$ where there exist [[h-cobordisms]] which are not [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to [[cylinders]] (such as for $n=5$ or when non-trivial [[Whitehead torsion]] exists), the [[Segal space]] $PreCob(n)$ modeling the [[(infinity,1)-category| (infinity,1)-category]] of cobordisms $Cob(n)$ fails to be a *[[complete Segal space]]*. This is because the [[infinity-groupoid]] of [[invertible morphisms]] (in degree 1) contains components corresponding to these non-trivial h-cobordisms, which are not in the image of the degeneracy map from the [[infinity-groupoid]] of objects (in degree 0, which represents the [[classifying spaces]] of the [[diffeomorphism groups]] of closed $(n-1)$-manifolds). Consequently, the *completion* of this Segal space has a space of objects strictly "larger" than that given by the [[shape]] of the diffeomorphism groups ([Lurie 2009, Warning 2.2.8](#Lurie2009)).
