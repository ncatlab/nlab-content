> [[flux|Flux]]- & [[charge]][[flux quantization|-quantization]] laws for [[higher gauge theories]] of [[Maxwell theory|Maxwell]]-type --- e.g. the common [[electromagnetic field]] but also the [[B-field|B-]], [[RR-field|RR-]], and [[supergravity|C-fields]] considered in [[string theory|string]]/[[M-theory]] --- specify [[non-perturbative quantum field theory|non-perturbative completions]] of these [[higher gauge fields]] by encoding their [[soliton|solitonic]] behaviour and hence the [[charges]] carried by the [[branes]] that source these fluxes.
>
> This pages surveys the general ([[rational homotopy theory|rational]]-)[[homotopy theory|homotopy theoretic]] understanding of flux- & charge-quantization via the [[Chern-Dold character map]] generalized to the non-linear [[Bianchi identities]] appearing in higher-dimensional [[supergravity]] theories, notably for the [[supergravity C-field|C-field in 11d]]. 
>
> While flux quantization applies already to [[classical field theory|classical]] gauge fields and might seem to be better called *flux discretization*, for disambiguation, the choice involved in flux quantization induces the actual [[nLab:strict deformation quantization]] of [[observables]] on fluxes.
>
> With higher flux quantization thus being a key aspect of the general formulation of [[non-perturbative quantum field theory]], which as a whole remains a major open problem of [[mathematical physics|mathematical]] [[theoretical physics]], it is instructive to understand it as a stage in the historical development towards this goal:
>
> * In 1852 [[Michael Faraday|Faraday]] observes [[magnetic field]] [[flux lines]] emanating from magnetic poles &lbrack;[Faraday 1852](#Faraday1852)&rbrack;. 
>   
> * In 1931 [[P. A. M. Dirac|Dirac]] invokes [[quantum mechanics]] to argue that, if there were unpaired such (mono-)poles, then the total flux emanating from them --- and thus the magnetic charge carried by them --- had to come in [[integer]] multiples of a unit quantum &lbrack;[Dirac 1931](#Dirac31)&rbrack;. 
>
> * In the 1950s, while magnetic monopoles remain unobserved, [[Alexei Abrikosov|Abrikosov]] observes that the same electromagnetic flux- \& charge-quantization mechanism makes [[Abrikosov vortex|vortex strings]] in [[type II superconductors]] carry units of localized magnetic flux.  &lbrack;[Abrikosov 1957](#Abrikosov57a)&rbrack;
>   
> * In 1985 [[Orlando Alvarez|Alvarez]] understands such *[[soliton|solitonic]]* [[magnetic fields]] as [[cocycles]] in ([[differential ordinary cohomology|differential]]) [[ordinary cohomology]]. &lbrack;[Alvarez 1985](#Alvarez85a)&rbrack;
>
> * In the 1990s [[string theory|string theorists]] argue that the combined flux of [[B-field|B-]] & [[RR-fields]] and hence the charge of [[D-branes]] is analogously quantized in the generalized cohomology theory called "[[twisted K-theory|twisted topological K-theory]]" &lbrack;[Minasian & Moore 1997](#MinasianMoore97); [Witten 1998](#Witten98)&rbrack;; 
>
>   and that the flux of the [[supergravity C-field|C-field]] and hence the charge of [[M-branes]] is quantized in a "[[shifted C-field flux quantization|shifted half-integral]]" cohomology theory &lbrack;[Witten 1996](#Witten96a)&rbrack; which long remains mysterious. 
>
> * In recent years [FSS 2020](#FSS20) have developed a systematic understanding of flux quantization of any higher gauge theory of Maxwell-type in generalized [[non-abelian cohomology]] theory, using [[fundamental theorem of dg-algebraic rational homotopy theory|tools from dg-algebraic]] [[rational homotopy theory]] related to the [[D'Auria-Fre formulation of supergravity|"FDA-method" in the supergravity literature]]. 
>
>   This provides a transparent re-derivation of known flux quantization laws and it allows to finally discuss C-field flux/M-brane charge quantization.

In [[higher gauge theories]] &lbrack;see [Alfonsi 2024, §2](#Alfonsi24); [BFJ${}^+$ 2024](#BFJKNRSW24)&rbrack;, *[[flux]]* of *[[field (physics)|fields]]* is sourced by [[charge|charged]] [[branes]], and *[[flux quantization]]* makes fluxes/charges form a discrete space, reflecting individual [[soliton|solitonic]] brane sources. A choice of flux quantization is a hypothesis about the [[non-perturbative quantum field theory|non-perturbative completion]] of the given theory.
