An algebraic variety is the set of zeroes of a finite or infinite set of homogeneous polynomials. we only consider complex algebraic varieties over the field $\mathbb{C}$. one must provide $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^n$ with a set of local coordinates. An algebraic variety is an embedding into some projective space $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^n$. If the Jacobian matrix has maximal rank k then the variety V has no singular points. If rank J < k, then there are singular points.

the surfaces $\Sigma_p$ are called algebraic curves. $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^1$ is the Riemann sphere. we work with holomorphic line bundles.

The moduli space $\mathcal{M}_p$ is the space of complex structures on $\Sigma_p$
