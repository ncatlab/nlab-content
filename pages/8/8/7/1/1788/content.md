Beware that the skew-symmetry of [[Lie algebras]] over the [[integers]], as opposed to over a [[field]] of [[characteristic zero]], implies for any element $\phi$ of [[even number|even]] homogeneous degree -- 
hence here for elements of [[homotopy groups]] in [[odd number|odd]] degree -- only that the bracket with itself vanishes after multiplication by 2

$$
  [\phi,\phi]_{Wh} = - [\phi,\phi]_{Wh}
  \phantom{AA}
  \text{hence equivalently}
  \phantom{AA}
  2 \cdot [\phi,\phi]_{Wh} = 0
$$

but not necessarily that $[\phi,\phi]_{Wh} = 0$ by itself -- since [[multiplication]] by 2 is not an [[isomorphism]] over the [[integers]].

But this means that the Whitehead bracket of any even-degree [[element]] with itself -- hence of any [[element]] of a [[homotopy group]] in [[odd number|odd]] degree -- has [[order of a group element|order]] at most 2, hence is in the 2-[[torsion subgroup]] of the respective [[homotopy group]].
