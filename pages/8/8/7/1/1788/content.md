Remarkably, among the infinity-toposes into which HoTT interprets are "tangent infinity-toposes" of parameterized module spectra, which behave like semantics for an enhancement of HoTT by dependent *linear* homotopy types, neatly combining the linear aspect of typed quantum programming languages (like Proto-Quipper) with homotopy-theoretic aspects providing a new *topological quantum* language.
