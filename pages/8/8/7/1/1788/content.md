### Group completed configuration spaces
 {#GroupCompletedConfigurationSpaces}

#### Charged particles and strings

We discuss configuration-spaces of "charged objects" as models for [[group completions]] of plain [[configuration spaces of points]].

Write $Conf(\mathbb{R}^n)$ for the "plain" configuration space of unlabeled and unordered points in the [[Cartesian space]] ([[Euclidean space]]) $\mathbb{R}^n$, hence the space of [[finite set|finite]] [[subsets]] of [[Cartesian space|$\mathbb{R}^n$]].
This is naturally a [[partial function|partial]] [[commutative monoid|abelian]] [[topological monoid]], where the addition of a pair of configurations is defined if they are [[disjoint]], in which case it is given by their (necessarily [[disjoint union|disjoint]]) [[union]] &lbrack;[Segal 1973, p. 215](#Segal73)&rbrack;.

Here we write
$$
  \mathbb{G}Conf(\mathbb{R}^n)
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \Omega B_{\sqcup} Conf(\mathbb{R}^n)
$$
for the [[group completion]] of the configuration space with respect to this partial operation of disjoint union. 

[Segal 1973, Thm. 1](#Segal73) says, in particular, that this group completed configuration space is [[weak homotopy equivalence|weak homotopy equivalent]] to the $n$-fold [[iterated loop space]] of the [[n-sphere|$n$-sphere]] $S^n$ (the $n$-[[Cohomotopy]] [[cocycle space]] of the [[one-point compactification]] $\mathbb{R}^n_{cpt}$):
\[
  \label{SegalTheorem1}
  \mathbb{G} Conf(\mathbb{R}^n)
  \;\simeq\;
  \Omega^n S^n
  \,,
\]

This motivates asking for more explicit descriptions of the group completed configuration space of points, itself as a configuration space, now of objects somewhat richer than plain points.

Since the group completion must introduce the existence of a kind of "anti-points" much in the sense of [[antiparticles]], it is tempting to think that $\mathbb{G}Conf(\mathbb{R}^n)$ should be equivalent to the configuration space $Conf^{\pm}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ of *charged* points, where each point in a configuration carries a label in $\{\pm 1\}$ and where equal-charged points cannot coincide (they "repel") while pairs of oppositely charged points may coincide in which case they annihilate &lbrack;[McDuff 1975, p. 94](#McDuff75)&rbrack;.
However, this is *not* the case: $Conf^{\pm}(\mathbb{R}^n) \neq \mathbb{G}Conf(\mathbb{R}^n)$ &lbrack;[McDuff 1975, p. 96](#McDuff75)&rbrack;.

Still, the basic idea can be salvaged &lbrack;[Okuyama 2005](#Okuyama05)&rbrack; if only one allows charged points to be replaced by "strings" --- concretely: straight line segments of finite lenght in $\mathbb{R}^n$ each parallel to, say, the first coordinate axis --- with charged endpoints, where pair creation/annihilation of strings smoothens out the corresponding interaction of points, in the familiar way in which interactions in [[string theory]] smoothen out singular [[Feynman diagrams]] (only that here this is not postulated but emerges in order that the resulting moduli space models $\mathbb{G}Conf(\mathbb{R}^n)$):

On the right, if a filled circle is taken to indicate that the corresponding point is part of the interval, while an open circle indicates that it is not, then the curved arrows correspond to continuous paths in the configuration space of intervals, $Conf^I(\mathbb{R}^n)$, according to [Okuyama 2005, Def. 3.1-2](#Okuyama05) --- there denoted $I_n(S^0)$.

With this stringy resolution of the charged points, the expected equivalence does hold &lbrack;[Okuyama 2005, Thm. 1](#Okuyama05)&rbrack;:

\[
  \label{OkuyamaTheorem}
  Conf^I(\mathbb{R}^n)
  \;\;
  \simeq
  \;\;
  \mathbb{G}Conf(\mathbb{R}^n)
  \,.
\]

#### Loop diagrams of charged string
 {#LoopsOfChargedStrings}

It follows that the [[fundamental group]] of the configuration space of charged strings in the [[plane]] $\mathbb{R}^2$ is

$$
  \pi_1\big(
    Conf^I(\mathbb{R}^2)  
  \big)
  \;\;\simeq\;\;
  \pi_1\big(
    \mathbb{G}Conf(\mathbb{R}^2)  
  \big)
  \;\;\simeq\;\;
  \pi_1\big(
    \Omega^2 S^2
  \big)
  \;\;\simeq\;\;
  \pi_0\big(
    \Omega(\Omega^2 S^2)
  \big)
  \;\;\simeq\;\;
  \pi_0\big(
    \Omega^3 S^2)
  \big)
  \;\;\simeq\;\;
  \pi^3(S^2)
  \;\;\simeq\;\;
  \mathbb{Z}
  \,,
$$

where the first [[isomorphism]] is by Okuyama's theorem (eq:OkuyamaTheorem), the second by Segal's theorem (eq:SegalTheorem1) and the last one is the statement that the 3d [[homotopy group of spheres|homotopy group of]] the [[2-sphere]] is the [[free group]] generated by the [[Hopf fibration]].

Hence we ask which loop diagram of charged strings corresponds to the Hopf fibration, under this sequences of isomorphisms.

First, the plain loop diagram should have the trivial class in $\pi_1$ of Okuyama's configuration space:


\begin{imagefromfile}
    "file_name": "ChargedStringLoop-240715.jpg",
    "width": 560,
    "unit": "px",
    "margin": {
        "top": -30,
        "bottom": 20,
        "right": 0, 
        "left": 15
    }
\end{imagefromfile}

But what about the charged stringy Hopf link --- is this trivial in $\pi_1$?

\begin{imagefromfile}
    "file_name": "ChargedStringHopfLink-240715.jpg",
    "width": 320,
    "unit": "px",
    "margin": {
        "top": -30,
        "bottom": 20,
        "right": 0, 
        "left": 15
    }
\end{imagefromfile}


{#ChargedStringLoopWithTwist} Maybe easier to see that the following loop is non-trivial:

\begin{imagefromfile}
    "file_name": "ChargedStringLoopWithTwist-240715.jpg",
    "width": 400,
    "unit": "px",
    "margin": {
        "top": -30,
        "bottom": 20,
        "right": 0, 
        "left": 15
    }
\end{imagefromfile}
