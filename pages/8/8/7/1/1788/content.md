
By the *quantum reader monad* we shall mean the [[reader monad]] but on the [[category]] of [[vector spaces]] (in applications specifically of [[complex vector spaces]], but essentially all discussion here applies over any [[ground field]]). The reason for the "[[quantum physics]]"-terminology is that this monad is closely related to --- in fact arguably is the fundamental formalization in [[categorical logic]] of --- the concept of [[quantum measurement]], including its subtle peculiarities such as the dependence on a choice of *measurement basis* and the phenomenon of [[wavefunction collapse]] entailed by the measurement process.


Recall that for $B \,\in\,$ [[Set]], the *$B$-[[reader monad]]* on [[Set]] is the [[endofunctor]] of foming [[mapping sets]] out of $B$

$$
  \bigcirc_B \;\coloneqq\; Map(B,-) \;\colon\; Set \to Set
$$

equipped with the [[structure]]
