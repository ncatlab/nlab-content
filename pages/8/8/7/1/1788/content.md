###### Lemma

Given $X \in \mathbf{H}$ such that $\flat X$ is 0-truncated, then $\mathbf{H}_{/\flat_{rel}X}$ is strongly $\infty$-connected over $(\mathbf{H}_{inf})_{/\flat_{rel}X}$.

###### Proof

We have an essential geometric morphism given by a composite of [[adjoint
triples]]

$$
  \array{
     \mathbf{H}_{/\flat_{rel}X}
     &
       \stackrel{\overset{\Pi_{rel}}{\longrightarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{Disc_{rel}}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{}{\longrightarrow}}} 
     &
     (\mathbf{H}_{inf})_{/\flat_{rel} X}
       \stackrel{\overset{\Pi \simeq \Gamma}{\longrightarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{\eta_X^\ast \circ Disc}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{}{\longrightarrow}}} 
  }
  \infty Grpd_{/\flat X}
  \,,
$$

where the top pairs come from the formula 
([here](adjoint+infinity-functor#OnSlices)) for localization of adjunctions to slices, and the bottom one exists in each case by the [[adjoint (∞,1)-functor theorem]],
since the middle one preserves [[(∞,1)-colimits]] (since colimits in slices are computed on the dependent sums, since $Disc$ preserves colimits, and since pullbacks preserve colimits in an $\infty$-topos).  The fact that two top composite preserves the terminal object follows now by the idempotency of the various adjunctions $\Pi_{rel} \flat_{rel} X \simeq \flat_{rel}X$ and then by [[infinitesimal cohesion]] $\Pi \flat_{rel} X \simeq \flat \flat_{rel} X \simeq \flat X$. Finally using that $\flat X$ is 0-connected, hence a set it follows from $\Pi \ast \simeq \ast$ that the composite right adjoint is fully faithful over over $x\in \flat X$, hence is fully faithful on all of $\infty Grpd$.
