## Dehn-Nielsen-Baer theorem

The *Dehn-Nielsen-Baer theorem* states, for [[closed manifold|closed]] [[orientation|orientable]] [[surfaces]] $\Sigma^2_g$ of [[positive number|positive]] [[genus of a surface|genus]],
$
  g \geq 1
$, 
that the canonical [[homomorphism]] from their extended [[mapping class group]] $MCG^{\pm}$ (including [[orientation]]-reversing maps) to the [[outer automorphism|outer]] [[automorphism group]] $Out(-)$ of their [[fundamental group]] $\pi_1(-)$ (at any basepoint, using that [[surfaces]] are assumed to be [[connected topological space|connected]]) is an [[isomorphism]]:

$$
  MCG^{\pm}(\Sigma^2_g)
  \xrightarrow{\sim}
  Out\big(
    \pi_1(\Sigma^2_g)
  \big) 
  \,.
$$
