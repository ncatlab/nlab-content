# Coend calculus

_Coend calculus_ rules the behaviour of certain universal objects associated to functors of two variables $T : C^{op}\times C \to D$; intuitively, $end(T)$ stands to $T$ as the limit $\lim F$ of $F : A \to B$ stands to $F$; the major difference is that $end(T)$ takes into account the fact that $T$ eats two objects of $C$, once covariantly and once contravariantly: indeed, on arrows $f : c\to c'$ the functor $T$ acts as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{ccccc}
&& T(c',c) && \\
&\overset{T(f,c)}\swarrow && \overset{T(c',f)}\searrow &\\
T(c,c) &&&& T(c',c')
\end{array}
$$

A distinguising feature of objects that depend on the same variable once covariantly, and once contravariantly is that they can be _integrated_: given a sufficiently regular function $f(x)$, its dependence from $x$ can be thought as "covariant", whereas the "$dx$" in

$$
\int f(x)d x
$$

can be thought of as exhibiting a contravariant dependence of $\int f$ from $x$.

Ends and coends are associated to functors $T : C^{op}\times C \to D$ in a way that resembles integrals: they are certain objects $\int_c T(c,c)$ (the end) and $\int^c T(c,c)$ (the coend), associated to $T$ in a certain canonical fashion, treating $c$ as a mute variable (meaning that $\int_c T(c,c)$ and $\int_{c'} T(c',c')$ are the same object), and satisfying a "commutative rule of integrals" analogous to

$$
\int f(x,y) d x d y = \int \Big(\int f(x,y)d x\Big) d y = \int \Big(\int f(x,y)d y\Big) d x
$$

This intuition can of course be made more precise: every universal object built in category theory can be thought either as a subobject of a product (a limit), or as a quotient of a coproduct (a colimit), and co/ends make no exception:

- An end arises as an "object of invariants" $\int_c T$ for the action of $T$ given by the arrow functions $T_{x y} : \hom_{C^{op}\times C}(x,y) \to D(T x, T y)$, and it is defined as the subobject of $\prod_{c\in C} T(c,c)$ of those elements invariant under this action.
- Dually, a _coend_ arises quotienting $\coprod_{c\in C}T(c,c)$ by a suitable equivalence relation generated by same functions $T_{x y} : \hom_{C^{op}\times C}(x,y) \to D(T x, T y)$, i.e. as a _space of orbits_ for the action.

Quite astoundingly, starting from this simple intuition it is possible to find such covariant-contravariant actions at every corner of category theory, to re-state the Yoneda lemma and the theory of Kan extensions in terms of co/ends, and to find plenty of applications to algebra, topology, geometry... and functional programming. :-)

## Dinaturality

As already said, any functor $T : C^{op}\times C \to D$ acts on morphisms as

$$
\begin{array}{ccccc}
&& T(c',c) && \\
&\overset{T(f,c)}\swarrow && \overset{T(c',f)}\searrow &\\
T(c,c) &&&& T(c',c')
\end{array}
$$

given _two_ such functors, say $P,Q : C^{op}\times C \to D$, we can consider the two diagrams

$$
\begin{array}{ccccc}
&& P(c',c) && \\
&\overset{P(f,c)}\swarrow && \overset{P(c',f)}\searrow &\\
P(c,c) &&&& P(c',c')
\end{array}
$$

and

$$
\begin{array}{ccccc}
Q(c,c)&&&& Q(c',c')\\
&\underset{Q(c,f)}\nwarrow&& \underset{Q(f,c')}\nearrow& \\
&&Q(c,c')&&
\end{array}
$$

Given two functors $F,G : A \to B$ a natural transformation can be seen as a family of maps that "fill the gap" between $F(f)$ and $G(f)$ in a commutative square; in a similar fashion, a _dinatural_ transformation between the above $P,q$ can be seen as a way to close a certain diagram that testifies a transformation from the arrow action of $P$ to the arrow action of $Q$:

$$
\begin{array}{ccccc}
&& P(c',c) && \\
&\overset{P(f,c)}\swarrow && \overset{P(c',f)}\searrow &\\
P(c,c) &&&& P(c',c')\\
\!\!\!\!{\color{red} \alpha_c\downarrow} &&&&\,\,\,\,\,\,\,{\color{red}\downarrow\alpha_{c'}} \\
Q(c,c)&&&& Q(c',c')\\
&\underset{Q(c,f)}\nwarrow&& \underset{Q(f,c')}\nearrow& \\
&&Q(c,c')&&
\end{array}
$$

Just as co/limits are defined via suitable transformation to/from a constant, so are co/ends:

- If $ Q : C^{op}\times C \to D$, a _wedge for $Q$ with base $x$_ consists of a dinatural transformation from the constant functor on $x\in D$, i.e. of a family of morphisms $\alpha_c : x\to Q(c,c)$ such that for each $f :c\to c'$ the above hexagon reduces to a commutative square:

$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
x &\to& Q(c,c)\\
\downarrow && \downarrow\\
Q(c',c') &\to & Q(c,c')
\end{array}
$$

- If $P : C^{op}\times C \to D$, a _cowedge for $P$ with tip $y$_ consists of a dinatural transformation to the constant functor on $y\in D$, i.e. of a family of morphisms $\alpha_c : P(c,c) \to y$ such that for each $f :c\to c'$ the above hexagon reduces to a commutative square:

$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
P(c',c) &\to& P(c,c)\\
\downarrow && \downarrow\\
P(c',c') &\to & y
\end{array}
$$

There exists a category $Wd(Q)$ of wedges, defined with an obvious choice of morphisms between bases; similarly, there is a category of cowedges $Cwd(P)$.

The _end_ $\int_c Q(c,c)$ of $Q$ is now defined as a terminal object in the category of its wedges; dually, the _coend_ $\int^c P(c,c)$ of $P$ is the initial object of the category of its cowedges. Of course, we say "the" end because such an initial object is unique up to unique isomorphism when it exists.

So far, so good. In fact, we didn't stray much far from plain old category theory, as it is possible to show the following:

_Lemma (co/ends are colimits)_: Given $Q : C^{op}\times C \to D$ there exist a category $\widetilde{C}$ and a functor $\widetilde Q : \widetilde C \to D$ such that

$$
\int_c Q(c,c) \cong \lim \,\widetilde Q
$$

For those who know: the end of $Q$ is the [weighted colimit](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/weighted+limit) of $Q : C^{op}\times C \to D$ with the $\hom_C$ functor $C^{op}\times C \to Set$, and thus the category $\widetilde{C}$ is nothing more, nothing less than the [category of elements](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/category+of+elements) of $\hom_C$; this allows for a very explicit presentation of $\widetilde{C}$:

- objects: the arrows of $C$, $f : c \to c'$;
- morphisms: the commutative squares

$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
c &\leftarrow& d \\
{}^f\downarrow && \downarrow^g\\
c' &\to& d'
\end{array}
$$

_Corollary (hom commutes with all ends):_ As a consequence of the fact that $\int_c Q$ is a limit, there is an isomorphism

$$
\hom_C\Big(y, \int_c P(c,c)\Big) \cong \int_c \hom_C(y, P(c,c))
$$

Dually,

$$
\hom_C\Big( \int^c P(c,c), y \Big )\cong \int_c \hom_C(P(c,c), y).
$$

There's only a mystery to uncover, before we start doing some explicit computations: why are co/ends denoted as integrals? The notation dates back to Yoneda, and it is essentially motivated by the fact that an end behaves like an integral:

_Theorem (Fubini rule):_ Let $P : C^{op}\times C \times D^{op}\times D \to E$ be a functor; then

$$
\int^c\left(\int^d P(c,c,d,d)\right) \cong
\int^{(c,d)}P(c,d,c,d)
\cong \int^d\left(\int^c P(c,c,d,d)\right)
$$

in the sense that if one of the three objects exists, so do the other two, and they are all canonically isomorphic (the category $C^{op}\times C \times D^\text{op}\times D$ is of course equal to $(C\times D)^\text{op}\times( C \times D)$). Similarly, there is such a rule for ends.

Thus, in category theory integration with respect to a variable is a process that can happen in whatever order we desire: given a permutation $\sigma$ of the set $\{1,\dots,n\}$, whenever the integral

$$
\int^{c_{\sigma 1}}\int^{c_{\sigma 2}}\cdots \int^{c_{\sigma n}} P(c_{\sigma 1},  c_{\sigma 1}, c_{\sigma 2}, c_{\sigma 2}, \dots, c_{\sigma n}, c_{\sigma n})
$$

exists, then so does

$$
\int^{(c_1,\dots, c_n)} P(c_1, c_1, c_2, c_2, \dots, c_n, c_n)
$$

_Proof._ The slickest proof I know for this goes as follows: assume all coend exist; then, sending a functor $P : C^{op}\times C \to D$ to its coend is a functor $\int^C : [C^{op}\times C, D] \to D$, and it is easy to see that it is a left adjoint (for those who know, $\int^C$ is a particular kind of weighted colimit, and every such weighted colimit admits a right adjoint expressed in terms of the weight: but now it's easy to prove that these right adjoints commute, thus yielding the Fubini rule by uniqueness of adjoints).

## The building blocks of co/end calculus

_Theorem (Natural transformations as an end)_ Let $F,G : C \to D$ be two functors; then, there is an isomorphism

$$
Nat(F,G) \cong \int_c \hom_D(F c,G c)
$$

_Proof._ There is a natural choice for a wedge $\omega : Nat(F,G) \to \hom(F c,G c)$, that sends a natural transformation to its $c$-component; it remains to show that this is indeed a terminal wedge. Given another wedge $\alpha : A \to \hom(F c, G c)$, the wedge condition translates into the equation
$$
godgaoi
$$
valid for every $a\in A$; but this is only a convoluted way to say that for every $a\in A$ the family
$$
\{\alpha_{a,c} : F c \to G c\}
$$
is a natural transformation. 


Two important remarks:

1. In an additive setting, the wedge condition for $\alpha$ can be easily translated into the fact that natural transformations appear form the kernel of a certain map; the intuition that naturality is a cocycle condition is more or less what led Yoneda to study ends and coends in homological algebra.

2. Even in non-additive setting, one can easily see that a natural transformation $\alpha : F \Rightarrow G$ is a map that equalizes the action of $F,G$ on arrows; this means that the following diagram
$$
Nat(F,G) \to bla \rightrightarrows ble
$$
is an equalizer; there is nothing special here, as for _every_ functor $T : C^{op}\times C \to D$ there is a similar equalizer diagram
$$
goaghaud
$$

Now for the Yoneda lemma:

_Theorem (The ninja Yoneda lemma)_ Let $F : C^{op} \to Set$; then for every object $a\in C$,

$$
F a\cong \int^c F c \times C(a,c)  \qquad
\int_c \Set(C(c,a), F c)
$$

_Proof._
_Theorem (Kan extensions are co/ends)_

_Proof._ The proof is a lengthy but completely straightforward "derivation rule" using the coend-fu we already know:

$$
 \begin{array}{rl}
  Nat(\text{Lan}_G F, H) &\textstyle \cong \int_a  \hom(\text{Lan}_G F( a ), H  a ) \\
  def  & \textstyle \cong \int_a     \hom\Big( \int^C \hom(G c, a )\times F c, H a  \Big)  \\
  Fub  & \textstyle \cong \int_{ a  c} \hom\Big( \hom(G c, a )\times F c, H a  \Big)         \\
  ccc  & \textstyle \cong \int_{ a  c} \hom\Big( F c,[\hom(G c, a ), H a ] \Big)       \\
  ccnt & \textstyle \cong \int_c    \hom\Big( F c,\int_a  [\hom(G c, a ), H a ] \Big)   \\
  nat  & \textstyle \cong \int_c    \hom\Big( F c,Nat(\hom(G c,-), H) \Big)      \\
  nat  & \textstyle \cong \int_c    \hom\Big( F C,H G C \Big) = Nat(F, H G)   \\
 \end{array}
$$

# Bimodules

Pastro and Street paper makes heavy use of the theory of _bimodules_. Let's dig deeper into their structure. First of all, let us define a bicategory as follows:

- objects are (unitary) rings $R,S,\dots$
- 1-cells $M : R \to S$ are modules ${}_S M_R$, left over $R$ and right over $S$.
- 2-cells $\varphi : {}_R M_S \to {}_R N_S$ are $R$-$S$-linear homomorphisms of modules.

The composition of 1-cells is the tensor product of modules: ${}_R M \otimes_S N_T$ is a $R$-$T$-bimodule for every $R$-$S$bimodule $M$ and every $S$-$T$-bimodule $N$ (so in particular this is not a strict 2-category); 2-cells are composed horizontally and vertically, using the obvious function composition, and bifunctoriality of $\otimes$.

Good! There is a 2-categorical characterization of modules. What is good for? Well: rings are monoids in the categori of abelian groups. We could have done the very same thing taking (plain) monoids, i.e. monoids in the category of sets, and defining a category of "bimodules" as sets with a left action of some monoid, and a right action of some other monoid.

What is interesting now is that we can generalize the same construction, with no additional cognitive loading, and take $X,Y,Z\dots$ to be multi-object monoids: we define a bicategory $Mod$ as follows:

- objects are categories $C,D, E,\dots$
- 1-cells $P : C &#8696; D$ are functors $P : D^{op}\times C \to Set$
- 2-cells are natural transformations between functors.

A functor $P : D^{op}\times C \to Set$ is a multiobject module on which the multiobject monoids $C,D$ act.

So categories really are monoids, and are also eager to act on sets.

A bimodule is also called a profunctor, a distributor, a correspondence, a span,... and possibly with many other names; each of these names comes from a certain intuition behind their nature that leads to the definition of the same bicategory:

- they are called _profunctors_ because they generalize functors: some profunctors are called _representable_, and they are the ones of the form $\hom(b,Fa)$ for some functor $F : A \to B$ between categories. A pro-functor thus works "[on behalf](https://www.etymonline.com/word/pro-) of a functor", as well as a relation generalizes a function.
- ...which is why some people prefer to call them _relators_: just as a func-tion is a special kind of rela-tion, a func-tor is a special kind of rela-tor.
- they are called _distributors_: as the nLab says,

    > Jean Bénabou, who invented the term and originally used “profunctor,” now prefers “distributor,” which is supposed to carry the intuition that a distribut*or* generalizes a funct*or* in a similar way to how a distribution generalizes a function.

    There's in fact a beautiful story about this: Lawvere defined a notion of [distribution](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Lawvere+distribution) between toposes that is in fact precisely a profunctor when the cateories are presheaf toposes.

- they are called _correspondences_ or _spans_ because of the [Grothendieck construction](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Grothendieck+construction): every presheaf $P : D^{op}\times C \to Set$ has a category of elements $El(P)$ that in this case is a discrete fibration over $D^{op}\times C$

Well... until now we cheated a bit. In order to get a bicategory we need to define a composition law for 1-cells and show that it is bifunctorial, and I didn't tell you how to do it: but it turns out it is really easy, if you know coend-fu! Indeed, the intuition of a bimodule as a "matrix indexed by its domain" and the rule to compose two relations guide us to find an expression to meaningfully compose $Q : A &#8696; B, P : B &#8696; C$. We can define

$$
(P \diamond Q) (a,c) = \int^b P(a,b)\times Q(b,c)
$$

boils down, on discrete domains $A,B\in\Set$ to a "matrix product of sets" like

$$
(P \diamond Q)_{a c} = \sum_{b\in B} P_{a b}\times Q_{b c}
$$

There is also a connection between the ways in which profunctors compose, and the way in which _relations_ do. Indeed, look how the two concepts closely resemble each other:

$$
\begin{array}{cccccc}
(x,z)\in S\circ R & \iff & \exists y\in Y & \big((x,y)\in R\big) & \wedge & \big((y,z)\in S\big) \\
  (P\diamond Q)(x,z) & = & \int^y & Q(x,y) & \times & P(y,z) \\
\end{array}
$$

(yes, you can make this precise by saying that sets are discrete categories, or even more precisely categories enriched over [truth values](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/%28-1%29-categoryhttps://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/%28-1%29-category), and that relations are precisely the $\{0,1\}$-enriched version of profunctors, as they are functions $A\times B \to \{0,1\}$!)
