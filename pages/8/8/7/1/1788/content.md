### Wilson loops in abelian Chern-Simons theory
 {#WilsonLoopsInAbelianChernSimonsTheory}

The traditional reasoning for the definition of [[Wilson loop]]-[[quantum observables]] in [[abelian Chern-Simons theory]] on the [[3-sphere]] [[3-sphere|$S^3$]] goes as follows (such as reviewed in [GMR 1994 ยง1](#GMR94)).

#### Ingredients

Any $\mathrm{U}(1)$-[[principal connection|connection]] on [[3-sphere|$S^3$]] (or $\mathbb{R}^3$) has [[underlying]] [[trivial bundle]] (since the [[homotopy classes]] of [[maps]] from $S^3$ to the [[classifying space]] $B \mathrm{U}(1)$, being an [[Eilenberg-MacLane space]] $K(\mathbb{Z},2)$, are all trivial: $\pi_0 Map\big(S^3, B \mathrm{U}(1)\big) \simeq \pi_3 B \mathrm{U}(1) \simeq 1$) and hence is represented by a globally defined [[differential 1-form]] 
\[
  \label{1Forms}
  A \in \Omega^1_{dR}\big(S^3\big)
  \mathrlap{\,.}
\]

Given an [[oriented link]] 
\[
  \label{ALink}
  \gamma \colon (S^1)^{n} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^3 \to S^3
\] 
(with $n$ [[connected components]] $L_a \colon S^1 \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$, for $a \in [n]$), its  *[[Wilson loop]]*/*[[holonomy]]* with respect to such a connection (eq:1Forms) is:

\[
  \label{Holonomy}
  \exp\left(
    \mathrm{i}
    \textstyle{\underset{{(S^1)^n}}{\int}} 
    \gamma^\ast A
  \right)
  \;\in\;
  \mathrm{U}(1)
  \,.
\]


The *[[expectation value]] of the $L$-[[Wilson loop]] [[quantum observable]]*, 
$$
  \left\langle
  \exp\left(
    \mathrm{i}
    \textstyle{\underset{{(S^1)^n}}{\int}} 
    \gamma^\ast A
  \right)
  \right\rangle
  \;\in\;
  \mathbb{C}
  \mathrlap{\,,}
$$
is then meant to be the normalized [[path integral]] "$\int D A$" over the space of [[gauge orbits]] of $A$ (eq:1Forms) of the expression (eq:Holonomy) times the exponentiated [[action functional]] of [[abelian Chern-Simons theory]], suggestively written as
\[
  \label{PathIntegralForAbelianChernSimonsWilsonLoops}
  \left\langle
  \exp\left(
    \mathrm{i}
    \textstyle{\underset{{(S^1)^n}}{\int}} 
    \gamma^\ast A
  \right)
  \right\rangle
  \;\;
  =
  \;\;
  \multiscripts{^{\text{"}}}{
  \frac{
    \displaystyle{\int D A}
    \;
    \exp\left(
      \tfrac{\mathrm{i}}{k}
      \textstyle{\underset{S^3}{\int}}
      A \wedge \mathrm{d}A
      \;+\;
      \mathrm{i}
      \textstyle{\underset{{(S^1)^n}}{\int}} 
      \gamma^\ast A
    \right)     
  }{
    \displaystyle{\int D A}
    \;
    \exp\left(
      \tfrac{\mathrm{i}}{k}
      \textstyle{\underset{S^3}{\int}}
      A \wedge \mathrm{d}A
    \right)     
  }
  }{^{\text{"}}}
  \mathrlap{\,.}
\]

As usual for [[path integrals]], the expression on the right of (eq:PathIntegralForAbelianChernSimonsWilsonLoops) remains undefined, since a suitable [[measure]] "$D A$" is not known and may not exist. As also usual for path integrals, one proceeds instead by postulating that the expression on the left of (eq:PathIntegralForAbelianChernSimonsWilsonLoops) satisfies enough structural properties that are *suggested* by the symbols on the right as to be uniquely fixed by these conditions --- and then take that to be the definition.

We proceed [below](#AbelianCSWilsonLoopsViaGaussianIntegrals) to discuss the usual such postulates, which proceed by applying expected properties of [[Gaussian integrals]]. 

A slightly different set of postulates, but more explicit than usual, is considered by [Guadagnini & Thuillier 2008 ยง4.3](#GuadagniniThuillier08).


#### The Gaussian path integral
 {#AbelianCSWilsonLoopsViaGaussianIntegrals}

Since the [[abelian Chern-Simons theory|abelian Chern-Simons]] [[Lagrangian density]] $A \wedge \mathrm{d}A$ is a [[quadratic form]] in $A$, one envisions that this expression follows the transformation rules of [[Gaussian integrals]] over elements $\phi \in \mathbb{R}^n$ of finite-dimensional [[Cartesian spaces]], for which 
$$
  Z(J)
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \int \mathrm{d}^n \phi\;
  \exp\Big(
    - \tfrac{1}{2}
    \phi \cdot M \cdot \phi 
    +
    J \cdot \phi
  \Big)
$$
evaluates to 
\[
  \label{EvaluationOfOrdinaryGaussianIntegral}
  Z(J)
  \;=\;
  Z(0)
  \,
  \exp\Big(
    \tfrac{1}{2}
    \, 
    J \cdot M^{-1} \cdot J
  \Big)
  \,.
\]

Systematically following through this analogy (using [[Fourier transform]] to turn the [[derivative]] in $A \mathrm{d} A$ into a [[multiplication]] operation) with some care (such as with attention to [[gauge fixing]]) suggests the expression
$$
  \left\langle
  \exp\left(
    \mathrm{i}
    \textstyle{\underset{{(S^1)^n}}{\int}} 
    \gamma^\ast A
  \right)
  \right\rangle
  \;=\;
  \multiscripts{^{\text{"}}}{
  \exp\bigg(
    -\tfrac{1}{2}
    \textstyle{\underset{\gamma}{\int}}
    \textstyle{\underset{\gamma}{\int}}
    \big\langle
      A_\mu(x)
      ,
      A_\nu(y)
    \big\rangle
    \, 
    \mathrm{d} x^\mu\, 
    \mathrm{d} y^\nu
  \bigg)
  }{^{\text{"}}}
  \,,
$$
where the *[[Chern-Simons propagator]]* -- namely the analog of $M^{-1}$ in (eq:EvaluationOfOrdinaryGaussianIntegral) -- is suggested to be
\[
  \label{AbelianCSPropagatorForComputationOfWilsonLoops}
  \big\langle
    A_\mu(x)
    ,
    A_\nu(y)
  \big\rangle
  \;=\;
  \multiscripts{^{\text{"}}}{
  \tfrac{1}{k}
  \epsilon_{\mu \nu \rho}
  \frac{
    x^\rho - y^\rho
  }{
    \left\vert x - y \right\vert^3
  }
  }{^{\text{"}}}
  \,.
\]

In summary, this suggests
\[
  \label{AbelianCSWilsonLoopObservableByNaivePathIntegral}
  \left\langle
  \exp\left(
    \mathrm{i}
    \textstyle{\underset{{(S^1)^n}}{\int}} 
    L^\ast A
  \right)
  \right\rangle
  \;=\;
  \multiscripts{^{\text{"}}}{
  \exp\bigg(
    -\tfrac{\mathrm{i}}{2k}
    \textstyle{\underset{\gamma}{\int}}
    \textstyle{\underset{\gamma}{\int}}
    \, 
    \mathrm{d} x^\mu\, 
    \mathrm{d} y^\nu
    \epsilon_{\mu \nu \rho}  
    \frac{
      x^\rho - y^\rho
    }{
      \left\vert x - y \right\vert^3
    } 
  \bigg)
  }{^{\text{"}}}
  \,,
\]

This is the proposed expression due to [Polyakov 1988 (3)](#Polyakov88), popularized by [Witten 1989 (2.29)](#Witten89).
It is *almost* the time-honored [[integral]] expression for the [[Gauss linking number]] of the link $\gamma$, except for those contributions where $x$ and $y$ run over the same [[connected component]].

Namely, of course, (eq:AbelianCSWilsonLoopObservableByNaivePathIntegral) is *still* not well-defined, since the propagator (eq:AbelianCSPropagatorForComputationOfWilsonLoops) is ill-defined whenever $x = y$.

In a final step of this traditional argument one applies a [[renormalization]] argument to deal with the "divergencies" of the exponent in (eq:AbelianCSWilsonLoopObservableByNaivePathIntegral) when $x = y$.

#### The renormalization choice

[Polyakov 1988 (5)](#Polyakov88) considered one regularization of (eq:AbelianCSPropagatorForComputationOfWilsonLoops), but [Witten 1989 p. 363](#Witten89) asserted that it is "clear" that another one should be used, as follows, and this has become the commonly accepted choice since:

Choose a [[framed link|framing]] of the link $\gamma$ (eq:ALink), hence a [[vector field]] $n$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ defined on $\gamma$ which is normal to $\dot \gamma$ and finally define (eq:AbelianCSWilsonLoopObservableByNaivePathIntegral) to be

\[
  \label{AbelianCSWilsonLoopObservableRenormalized}
  \left\langle
  \exp\left(
    \mathrm{i}
    \textstyle{\underset{{(S^1)^n}}{\int}} 
    L^\ast A
  \right)
  \right\rangle
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \underset{
    \left\vert n \right\vert n \to 0
  }{\lim}
  \exp\bigg(
    -\tfrac{\mathrm{i}}{2k}
    \textstyle{\underset{(S^1)^n}{\int}}
    \textstyle{\underset{(S^1)^n}{\int}}
    \, 
    \mathrm{d} \sigma\, 
    \mathrm{d} \sigma'
    \,
    \frac
      {\partial \gamma^\mu(\sigma)}
      {\partial \sigma}
    \frac
      {\partial (\gamma^\nu + n^\nu)(\sigma')}
      {\partial \sigma'}    
    \epsilon_{\mu \nu \rho}  
    \frac{
      \gamma^\rho(\sigma) 
        - 
      \big(\gamma^\rho(\sigma') + n^\rho(\sigma')\big)
    }{
      \left\vert 
        \gamma(\sigma) 
        - 
        \big(
          \gamma(\sigma') + n(\sigma')
        \big) 
      \right\vert^3
    } 
  \bigg)
  \,,
\]
where the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] $\left\vert n \right\vert n \to 0$ is over normal vector fields that keep the [[direction of a vector|direction]] but shrink in [[length]] (cf. [GMR 1994 (1.5)](#GMR94)).

This expression is finally well-defined. The shift by the framing does not change that part of the integral where $\sigma$ and $\sigma'$ run over distinct [[connected components]] of the link, hence that part now does give the [[linking number]] of the [[oriented link]]. At the same time the shift makes the contributions $\sigma$ and $\sigma'$ do run over the same connected component become the [[linking number]] of that component with its shift by the framing, which is its [[framing number]].

The end result is hence in the exponent the sum of the [[framing number]] with the [[linking number]] of the link, which is its *[[writhe]]*.
