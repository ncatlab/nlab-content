**Complete Topological Quantization of Higher (SuGra-type) Gauge Fields**

> We explain how --- after global completion of higher gauge fields (as appearing in higher supergravity) by proper flux quantization in extraordinary nonabelian cohomology --- the (non-perturbative, renormalized) topological quantum observables on solitonic fields are completely determined as soon as the (globally hyperbolic) spacetime carries an M-theoretic (circle) fiber: They are given by the string topology BV-algebra of the moduli space of quantized solitonic charges on any Cauchy surface. In the instructive example of 5D Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory (the gauge sector of 5D SuGra) flux-quantized in 2-Cohomotopy and dimensionally reduced to 3D, this recovers in fine detail the traditionally renormalized (Wilson loop) observables of 3D Chern-Simons theory and makes novel predictions about anyons in fractional quantum Hall systems. We close with listing evidence that the analogous flux-quantization of 11D higher Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory (the gauge sector of 11D SuGra) in 4-Cohomotopy realizes aspects of the topological sector of *M-theory*.
