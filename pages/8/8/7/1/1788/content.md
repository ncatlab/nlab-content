\begin{remark}\label{NeedForDependentRecursion}
**(the need for dependent recursion, [Paulin-Mohring (1993, p. 330)](#Paulin-Mohring93))**
\linebreak
  The appearance of the argument "$n$" on the right of (eq:FormulaForDependentRecursion) -- in contrast to formula (eq:FormulaForNonDependentRecursion) for non-dependent recursion -- means (in view of the argument $succ(n)$ on the left) that the recursor $succ_D$ has access to the *[[predecessor]]* [[function]]. This is necessary in order to express all computable functions on the natural numbers inductively and hence explains the need for the [[dependent type|dependently typed]] recursion principle (eq:AssumingUnderlyingScliceObjectToBeIndependent) 
\end{remark}
