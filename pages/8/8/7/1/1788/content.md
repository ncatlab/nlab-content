In [Awodey 09](#Awodey09), [Awodey 10](#Awodey10) was first stated the 
the idea that [[dependent type theory]] with intensional [[identity types]] ([[Martin-Löf dependent type theory]]) viewed as [[homotopy type theory]] is in similar relation to the concept of [[(∞,1)-toposes]] as [[extensional type theory]] is to the ordinary concept of [[toposes]].

Following this suggestion, the weaker form of this idea, ignoring the univalent [[type universe]] and relating to the broader class of [[locally Cartesian closed (∞,1)-categories]] was stated more concretely as a conjecture in [Joyal 11](#Joyal11).

Indeed, a proof of this weaker form of the conjecture, in form of the statement that every [[locally presentable (∞,1)-category|locally presentable]] [[locally Cartesian closed (∞,1)-category]] is presented by a suitable [[type theoretic model category]] which provides [[categorical semantics]] for [[homotopy type theory]], was proven soon after the conjecture was stated
