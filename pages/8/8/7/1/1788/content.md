## History

More recently, the S-matrix perspective becomes fashionable also in [[Yang-Mills theory]], with people noticing that [[super Yang-Mills theory]] and [[Tr(ϕ³)]] enjoy good structures in its scattering amplitudes which are essentially invisible in the vast summation of [[Feynman diagrams]] that extract the S-matrix from the [[action functional]]. Instead there are entirely different mathematical structures that encode at least some sub-class of scattering amplitudes (see at _[[amplituhedron]]_ and _[[associahedron]]_). This has lead to increasingly close ties between the S-matrix program and the mathematical fields of [[geometry]] and [[combinatorics]], allowing for the development of various other structures in [[quantum field theory]] that encode, for instance, the [[Wheeler superspace|Wheeler]]-[[wavefunction]] of the [[observable universe|universe]] (see at _[[cosmohedron]]_) and the [[ultraviolet divergence|UV]]/[[infrared divergence|IR]] [[divergent series|divergence]] of [[Feynman integrals]] (see at _[[Feynman polytope]]_).
