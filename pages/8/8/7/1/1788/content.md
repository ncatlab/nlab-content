The [[algebraic cobordism]] which Snaith introduced studying [[stable homotopy theory]] is not closely related to the [[algebraic cobordism]] in the sense of Morel-Levine.

 Snaith's algebraic cobordism is in 1979 Memoirs article introduced as a special case of a variant of his general construction of a periodic [[mutliplicative cohomology theory]] $X(b)^*(-)$ out of a pair consisting of a homotopy commutative [[H-monoid]] $X$ and a class $b\in \pi_n(X)$. If $X = B S^1$ and $b$ is a generator of $\pi_2(BS^1)\cong\mathbb{Z}$ then $X(b)^*(-)$ is isomorphic with 2-periodic [[complex K-theory]]. For $X = B U$ and $b$ a generator of $\pi_2(BU)\cong\mathbb{Z}$ one obtains $MU^*[u_2,u_2^{-1}]$ where $MU^*$ is the (topological) complex cobordism and $u_2$ is the periodicity element. Then Snaith introduces a variant of such constructions with a more general ring $A$ replacing the complex numbers; and uses the Quillen's description of algebraic K-theory of a ring $A$ in terms of the classifying space $BGLA$; this way he obtains an algebraic cobordism theory. Snaith's algebraic cobordism is in a way too big. One of the main motivations was to understand better the algebraic K-theory and the characteristic classes in algebraic context, similar to the relations coming from the Conner-Floyd isomorphism

$$
K^*(X) = U^*(X)\otimes_{\Omega_U}\mathbb{Z}
$$

where $\Omega_U$ is the cobordism ring of almost complex manifolds and $\mathbb{Z}$ has a structure of $\Omega_U$-module via the Todd class. Recently, Gepner and Snaith returned to the question of algebraic cobordism this time using the motivic version of algebraic cobordism of Voevodsky, namely the [[motivic spectrum]] $MGL$ representing universal
oriented motivic cohomology theory (which is different from Morel-Voevodsky algebraic cobordism), and to the motivic version of Conner-Floyd isomorphism for which they give a comparably short proof.
