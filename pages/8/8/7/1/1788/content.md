Title: *Topological quantum computation and Defect branes in supergravity.*

Recalling that the infamous open issues with quantizing gravity concern its full *non-perturbative* form (while perturbative quantum gravity is well-understood as an effective field theory), we highlight that any non-perturbative completion of higher-dimensional supergravity first of all involves a choice of flux-quantization law (a suitable generalized cohomology theory) of the corresponding higher gauge field. While (quantum states of) "defect branes" (those of co-dimension=2) have previously been suggested to exhibit braid group monodromy like anyons in 2-dimensional quantum materials, the traditional hypothesis that RR-field fluxes in D=10 supergravity are quantized in (differential) K-theory does not seem to exhibit such a phenomenon. But in D=11 supergravity it is possible to quantize C-field fluxes in a generalized *non-abelian* cohomology theory called (differential) Cohomotopy. The resulting topological quantum states of defect branes inside M5-branes (M5/M5-intersections) turn out to be braid group representations of just the kind commonly envisioned as a substrate for topological quantum computation. We give an exposition of these results from Sati & Schreiber (2023) (doi:10.1142/S0129055X23500095, doi:10.1142/S0129055X23500010).
