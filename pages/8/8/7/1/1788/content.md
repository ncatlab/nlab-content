Topological phases of quantum materials and generally brane charges in quantum gravity are measured by extraordinary cohomology of orbifolded spaces and fragilely/microscopically by nonabelian cohomology twisted by tangential and other geometric orbifold structure. These applications, with more or less direct import for cutting-edge experimental physics, motivate the further development of the ancient algebro-topological concept of cohomology to a good notion of generalized nonabelian twisted geometric orbifold cohomology. 

After surveying the general outlook and key example applications, the book begins gently with a pedagogical development of a streamlined construction of topological twisted nonabelian orbifold cohomology realized as connected components of topological slice mapping stacks, and showcases in this manner a neat novel construction of twisted orbi-orientifold K-theory. 

In order to refine this notion of twisted nonabelian orbifold cohomology to become sensitive to geometric (tangential) orbifold structure, the second half of the book shifts gears to modern geometric homotopy theory (higher topos theory) and introduces a notion of singular-cohesive $\infty$-toposes faithfully embedding manifolds, orbifolds and higher etale stacks and orbispaces into a modal synthetic geometry which allows to elegantly axiomatize higher differential Cartan geometry. Again by forming connected components of suitable slice mapping stacks, but now in the singular-cohesive $\infty$-topos, this yields relevant notions of generalized twisted nonabelian geometric orbifold cohomology. 

A showcase result proven in this generality is that tangentially twisted cohomology of orbifolds reduces in the vicinity of orbifold singularities to $RO(G)$-graded equivariant cohomology. We close with spelling out the construction of twisted nonabelian (unstable) orbifold Cohomotopy in this manner, which in the motivating applications is the fragile/microscopic recipient for phases of Chern insulator materials and M-branes.
