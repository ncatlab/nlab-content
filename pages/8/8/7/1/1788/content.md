### The Lagrangian density and the Level

Let's normalize [[connection]] [[differential forms|forms]] according to the common convention in theoretical physics, where the [[field strength]]/[[flux density]]  $F_A \coloneqq \mathrm{d}A$ it such that
\[
  \label{NormalizationPfFluxDensity}
  \tfrac{1}{2\pi} F_A
  \;\in\;
  \Omega^2_{int, cls}
\]
is an [[integral form]], in that it has [[integer]] [periods](period#InDifferentialGeometry) (cf. *[[Dirac charge quantization]]* and *[[ordinary differential cohomology]]*).


The [[Lagrangian density]] of abelian Chern-Simons theory is a multiple of the [[Chern-Simons form]]
$$
  L(A)
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \tfrac{K}{4\pi} A \wedge \mathrm{d} A
  \,
$$ 
for a numerical parameter $K$ to be fixed, so that the [[action functional]]
$$
  S(\Sigma^3, A)
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \tfrac{K}{4\pi}
  \textstyle{\int_{\Sigma^3}} 
  A \wedge \mathrm{d}A
$$
has [[gauge invariance|gauge-invariant]] [[exponential]]
$$
  \exp\Big(
    \mathrm{i} S(A)
  \Big)
  \;=\;
  \exp\Big( 
    \mathrm{i}
    \tfrac{K}{4\pi}
    \textstyle{\int_{\Sigma^3}} 
    A \wedge \mathrm{d}A
  \Big)
  \;\in\;
  \mathrm{U}(1)
  \,.
$$

A transparent way to understand this condition is to consider (in the style of the definition of [[Cheeger-Simons differential characters]]) a [[compact topological space|compact]] [[4-manifold]] $\Sigma^4$ [[manifold with boundary|with boundary]] $\Sigma^3 = \partial \Sigma^4$ and an extension of the $\mathrm{U}(1)$-connection to $\Sigma^4$, where we will denote its [[curvature]]/[[field strength]]/[[flux density]] still by $F$. 

Then the [[Stokes theorem]] gives
$$
  \exp\Big(
    \mathrm{i} S(A)
  \Big)
  \;=\;
  \exp\Big(
    \mathrm{i}
    \tfrac{K}{4\pi}
    \textstyle{\int_{\Sigma^4}}
    F \wedge F
  \Big)
  \;=\;
  \exp\Big(
    K \pi \mathrm{i}
    \textstyle{\int_{\Sigma^4}}
    \frac{F}{2\pi} \wedge \frac{F}{2\pi}
  \Big)
  \,.
$$
For this to be well-defined --- in that it takes the same value for any other choice of $\Sigma^4$, we need that for *[[closed manifold|closed]]* $\widehat{\Sigma}^4$ we have
$$
  \tfrac{1}{2\pi \mathrm{i}}
  K \pi \mathrm{i}
  \underset{
    c_1^2(\Sigma^4)
  }{
    \underbrace{
      \textstyle{\int_{\widehat{\Sigma}^4}}
      \frac{F}{2\pi} \wedge \frac{F}{2\pi}
    }
  }
  \;\in\;
  \mathbb{Z}
  \,.
$$

If there is no further condition on $\Sigma^3$ and hence on $\widehat{\Sigma}^4$, then by (eq:NormalizationPfFluxDensity), $c_1^2(\Sigma^4) \in \mathbb{Z}$ and the condition is that 
$$
  k 
    \;\coloneqq\; 
  \tfrac{K}{2}
    \;\in\;
  \mathbb{Z}
$$ 
must be an [[integer]]. This is the *[[Chern-Simons level]]*.

However, if we restrict evaluation to [[spin manifolds]] then ([Dijkgraaf & Witten 1990 ยง5](#DijkgraafWitten90)):

from the observation that the [[cobordism ring]] for spin 3-manifolds with complex line bundles is trivial, and that 
$$
  \widehat{\Sigma}^4 
  \;
  \text{spin manifold}
  \;\;
  \Rightarrow
  \;\;
  \int_{\widehat{\Sigma}^4}
  \frac{F}{2\pi} \wedge \frac{F}{2\pi}
  \;\in\;
  2\mathbb{Z}
$$
it follows that for *[[spin Chern-Simons theory]]* one may allow
$$ 
  k 
    \;\in\;
  \tfrac{1}{2}\mathbb{Z} 
  \;\;\;\;\;\;
  \text{equivalently}
  \;\;\;\;\;\;
  K \coloneqq 2k 
  \;\in\;
  \mathbb{Z}
  \,.
$$
