Rod editing in new empty profile for Firefox Nightly
when bad cookies.sqlite copied in I can't edit


I've just removed all 3 ncatlab.org cookies and am trying again. 


I got the message

> Anonymous has been editing this page for 3 minutes.

> Edit the page anyway Cancel


So I'm trying "Edit the page anyway" 


That worked, now trying with bad cookies restored
