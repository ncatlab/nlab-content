Where 

* [[categorical logic]] is [[formal logic]]/[[type theory]] regarded as the [[internal logic]]/[[internal language]] of [[categories]], notably of categories well-suited for this purposes, such as [[elementary toposes]],

so 

* 2-categorical logic, or *2-logic* for short, as understood in this entry here, is (or should be, once developed) the [[categorification]] of this situation, namely the study of the [[internal logic]]/[[internal language|language]] of [[2-categories]] (understood in the generality including [[bicategories]], [[double categories]], etc.), and notably of 2-categories well-suited for this purpose, such as those one will want to call *elementary [[2-toposes]]*.

Therefore, the step from [[formal logic]]/[[categorical logic]] to formal 2-logic/2-categorical logic is analogous to the step from the former to [[homotopy type theory]], where one instead considers the [[internal language]] of [[(infinity,1)-categories|$(\infty,1)$-categories]]. 

This means that 2-logic is a genuine extension of ordinary logic with new logical constructions and phenomena (largely still to be isolated properly) --- analogous to how [[homotopy type theory]] enhances ordinary logical [[types]] to [[homotopy types]], so 2-logic will be speaking about "2-types" of sorts.

For example, 

* where [[subobject classifiers]] in ordinary [[elementary toposes]] serve as [[universes of propositions]] for their [[first order logic|first order]] [[internal logic]], 

* where [[object classifiers]] in [[(infinity,1)-toposes|$(\infty,1)$-toposes]] serve as [[type universes]] for their   [[homotopy type theory|homotopy]] [[internal logic]],  

* so [[2-toposes]] have *fibration classifiers* which should serve as universes of "2-types" for their internal 2-logic.

  Accordingly, [[powersets]] in ordinary logic/[[set theory]] become [[categories of presheaves]] in 2-logic, and the Cantor embedding becomes the [[Yoneda embedding]], etc.


In fact, there should be a joint generalization and unification of 2-logic of "2-types" with the "$(\infty,1)$-logic" of [[homotopy types]], namely given by the internal language of [[(infinity,2)-categories|$(\infty,2)$-categories]] (notably of [[(infinity,2)-toposes|$(\infty,2)$-toposes]]): This $(\infty,2)$-logic is currently being developed under the name *[[directed homotopy type theory]]* and as such, even if itself nascent, may be the most developed form of [[syntax|syntactic]] 2-logic that has found attention for.

This means that 2-logic in the sense of this page here is *not* about the related but different idea of using general tools from [[2-category theory]] in the study of ordinary [[1-category|1-]][[categorical logic]], hence is *not* along the lines of how [[formal category theory]] uses [[2-category theory]] to study [[1-categories]]. 

Of course, there may be relation and overlap between 2-logic proper and such "formal categorical logic" using 2-categorical methods in 1-logic. With genuine 2-logic not being developed much at all at this point, most of the references listed below actually fall on the side of 2-categorical methods in 1-logic.

For instance, for a suitable 2-dimensional [[sketch]]-like object its 2-category of [[models]] in [[Cat]] is a category of [[algebraic theories|1-theories]]: [[coherent categories]], [[regular categories]], [[lex categories]]. Thus, on one side we have the study of 2-sketch like objects, of [[2-monads]] on [[Cat]] and [[Lex]], and on [[2-functor|2-]][[functorial semantics]]. This is the adagio that *2-theories are logics*. On the other we have the study of 2-categories of (1)-theories, i.e. the idea that *2-models are 1-theories*.
