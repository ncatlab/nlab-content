
The biggest threat to a good idea are often its proponents, or those who vocally appear to be. 

String theory originated in the 1960s as a conceptual strategy for understanding experimental observations about strongly-interacting fundamental particles, notably the [[confinement]] of "[[quarks]]" inside [[hadrons]] and the "[[Regge trajectories]]" seen in [[hadron]] [[scattering]]. These are experimental phenomena exhibited by fairly ordinary [[matter]] (all [[atomic nuclei]] are [[bound states]] of [[hadrons]]), and yet (despite frequent advertisement of the success of the [[standard model of particle physics]]) understanding them properly remains an open problem to this day, to the extent that one speaks of a "[Millennium Problem](mass+gap#ReferencesMassGapProblem)".

However, a saga of 4 decades of intellectural twists and sociological turns later, string theorists as a swarm community largely forgot about the glaring question why quarks are never seen in isolation and somehow ended up, in the 2000s, instead convincing themselves and the public that string theory's  prime contribution to physics is to suggest the imminent detection of "[[squarks]]" at the [[LHC]]-experiment commencing in 2010. The failure of this alleged prediction to materialize is increasingly leading to the sensation of a failure of "string theory". 

In reality, this should be a chance to go back to the roots and re-assess string theory as a candidate for the elusive theory of strongly-interacting matter systems, both in [[high energy physics]] --- concerning [[quantum hadrodynamics]] in [[QCD]] --- as well as in [[solid-state physics]] --- notably concerning [[topological order|topologically ordered]] [[quantum materials]] ---, both controlled by a "[[mass gaps]]"-phenomenon and both still related to [[quantum gravity]] via [[holography]].

This is role of string theory that [[Alexander Polyakov]], one of the founding fathers, [originally envisioned](AdS-CFT+correspondence#PolyakovGaugeStringDualityReferences).

The following over/underlines recently come out tiny when viewed in

while they still come out as expected in 

* Firefox 

(at least on the systems we tried in discussion [here](https://nforum.ncatlab.org/discussion/12362/twisted-arrow-1category/?Focus=110459#Comment_110459)):

* "`$\overline{ThisShouldRenderWithALooongUnderline}$`" 

  renders as: 

  "$\underline{ThisShouldRenderWithALooongUnderline}$"

Specifically, the rendering with Chrome, Edge and Opera looks (except for horizontal positioning) like that of the `\bar` command:

* "`$\bar{ThisShouldRenderWithATinyOverline}$`" 

  renders as: 

  "$\bar{ThisShouldRenderWithATinyOverline}$"
