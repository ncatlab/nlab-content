**Abstract.** The global (non-perturbative) definition of higher gauge fields requires choices of "flux-quantization laws".

This is classical for electromagnetism (with Dirac quantization given by line bundles), and famous for RR-fields (whose quantization conjecturally is in topological K-theory).

But when the higher Maxwell-type equations are non-linear in the fluxes
(as they generically are in higher dimensional supergravity) then such
Whitehead-generalized
cohomology theories fail as flux-quantization laws, and what is needed
are more general *non-abelian cohomology* theories (as in: non-abelian
Poincaré duality).

I will first discuss the algebraic topology behind this statement, notably the
generalization of the Chern character map from K-theory to nonabelian cohomology
via classical methods of dg-algebraic rational homotopy theory,
following our monograph `doi:10.1142/13422`.

Then I will turn to the example of 11d super-gravity, and explain how
one viable flux quantization here (aka: a "model for the C-field")
is given by twisted forms of Pontrjagin-Borsuk-Spanier's "Co-Homotopy" theory,
and how the choice of this law ("Hypothesis H") provably implies
phenomena that have been conjectured to hold in the completion of 11d
super-gravity
by "M-theory" -- such as the half-integral ($\lambda/2$-shifted)
quantization of the 4-flux density.

This is reporting on joint work with Hisham Sati.

## Sugimoto string theory


The *Sugimoto string theory* is a non-[[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] version of [[type I string theory]], given by 10d [[type IIB string theory]] on an $O9^+$ [[orientifold]] (instead of $O9^-$), hence with [[RR-field tadpole cancellation]] by 32 *[[anti-brane|anti]]* [[D9-branes]] (instead of plain D9-branes), whose [[gauge group]] is the [[symplectic group]] $USp(32)$.
