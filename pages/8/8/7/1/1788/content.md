Let $\mathbb{Z}^n_{\sum= [0]_k } \hookrightarrow \mathbb{Z}^n$ be the subgroup on those [[n-tuple|$n$-tuples]] of [[integers]] $(n_i)_{i = 1}^n$ whose [[sum]] is a multiple of $k \in \mathbb{Z}$, hence whose sum vanishes [[modulo]] $k$: $\sum_i n_i = 0 \,mod\, k$.

The [[cosets]] of this [[subgroup]] inclusion are clearly indexed by $C_k \equiv \mathbb{Z}/k$, and an element $(n_i)_{i=1}^k \,\in\,\mathbb{Z}^n$ belongs to the coset $r \,mod\, k$ if $\sum_i n_i = r \,mod\, k$. Hence we have a [[short exact sequence]]

  0 
    \to 
  \mathbb{Z}^n_{\sum = [0]_k}
    \longrightarrow
  \mathbb{Z}^n
    \xrightarrow{\sum \,\mathrm{mod}\, k}
  C_k
    \to 
  0
