Let 

$$
  \mathcal{X}
  \;\coloneqq\;
  OrbSnglr\big(  X \!\sslash\! G \big)
$$ 

be the global quotient [[orbifold]] supposed to correspond to a [[smooth manifold]] $X$ equipped with the [[action]] of a [[finite group]] $G$ (for definiteness, and to avoid inessential technical fine-print).

Write

* $Snglr(\mathcal{X}) = X/G$ for its naive quotient space, 

  traditionally regarded as [[topological space]] (namely the [[quotient topological space]] of the [[topological G-space]] underlying $X$),

  though this quotient does exist also in [[diffeological spaces]], which would be the more appropriate [[category]] to regard it in ([IKZ 10](#IKZ10));

* $Smth(\mathcal{X}) = X \sslash G$ for its [[homotopy quotient]] space,

  traditionally regarded as a [[topological space]] (namely the [[Borel construction]] on the [[topological G-space]] underlying X),

  though this homotopy quotient does exists also in [[differentiable stacks]]/[[smooth groupoids]], which is the more appropriate [[(2,1)-category]] to regard it in ([MP97](#MoerdijkPronk97)).

Most notions of [[cohomology]] of the orbifold $\mathcal{X}$ considered in existing literature are actually invariants just of $Snglr(\mathcal{X})$ or just of $Smth(\mathcal{X})$, and mostly just of their underlying topological spaces -- the closest to an exception to this rule is Chen-Ruan cohomology, which however is also just the cohomology of a naive quotient, just of a different orbifold (the [[inertia orbifold]]):

| cohomology of $Snglr(\mathcal{X})$   |   cohomology of $Smth(\mathcal{X})$   |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------|
| Satake: $H^\bullet_{dR}(\mathcal{X}) \simeq H^\bullet\big(Snglr(\mathcal{X}),\mathbb{R}\big)$ |  |
|  -- | --  |
| Chen-Ruan: $H^\bullet_{CR}(\mathcal{X}) \simeq H^\bullet\Big( Snglr\big( [\mathcal{B}\mathbb{Z}, \mathcal{X}] \big)  ,\mathbb{R}\Big)$ <br/> (see [Clader 14, p. 4, p.7](#Clader14))|   |
