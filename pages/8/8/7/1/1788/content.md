**Orientations of Orbi-K-Theory measuring Topological Phases and Brane Charges**

In [[theoretical physics]], [[Chern insulator|Chern phases]] of [[topological phases of matter|topological]] [[quantum materials]], as well as [[brane]] [[charges]] on [[11D supergravity]] [[orbifolds]], have famously been argued to be classified by ([[orbifold K-theory|orbi]]) [[topological K-theory]], or possibly by other [[Whitehead-generalized cohomology theory|stable]] and, notably, [[complex-oriented cohomology theory|complex-oriented]] [[cohomology theories]], such as [[cobordism cohomology|stable Cobordism]] or [[elliptic cohomology]]. 

However, closer inspection reveals that the fine-grained "[fragile](topological+phase+of+matter#ReferencesUnstableClassificationOfTopologicalPhases)" classification in both cases plausibly is in ([[equivariant Cohomotopy|orbi]]) [[Cohomotopy]], which is the primordial "unstable" or [[non-abelian cohomology|nonabelian]] [[generalized cohomology]]. Coarsening should take the latter (fragile) to the former (stable) cohomology along an extraordinary [[cohomology operation]]. But what then is the role of [[complex-oriented cohomology|complex orientation]] on the stable side?

We observe here (i) that over [[nodal lines]] in the [[Brillouin torus]]/on [[probe brane|probe]] [[M5-branes]] in [[D=11 supergravity|11D]] [[spacetime]], the [[cohomotopy|cohomotopical]] [[topological phase of matter|phases]]/[[D-brane charge|charges]] lift through the [[complex Hopf fibration|complex]]/[[quaternionic Hopf fibration|quaternionic]] [[Hopf fibration]], and (ii) that observing this fragile situation in stable cohomology means equivalently to ask for universal [[complex oriented cohomology|complex]]/[[quaternionic oriented cohomology|quaternionic]] [orientation in four/ten dimensions](complex+oriented+cohomology+theory#ReferencesFiniteStageOrientations)!

Then we give an elegant concrete realization of such [four/ten-dimensional](complex+oriented+cohomology+theory#ReferencesFiniteStageOrientations) [[complex oriented cohomology|complex]]/[[quaternionic oriented cohomology|quaternionic]] orientation in [[Sp(1)|$Sp(1)$]]/[[Sp(2)|$Sp(2)$]]-[[equivariant K-theory]], using [real division-algebraic tools](geometry+of+physics+--+supersymmetry#RealSpinRepresentationViaNormedDivisionAlgebra) with a [new model](twisted+equivariant+K-theory#SS25) of [[twisted equivariant K-theory]] in [[cohesive (infinity,1)-topos|cohesive homotopy theory]]; and we explain this as an extraordinary character map from [[equivariant Cohomotopy|equivariant]] [[Cohomotopy]]-[[twisted Cohomotopy]] to [[equivariant K-theory|equivariant]] [[relative K-theory]].

A universal [[real oriented cohomology theory|real]], [[complex oriented cohomology theory|complex]] or [[quaternionic oriented cohomology theory|quaternionic]] "[[orientation in generalized cohomology|orientation]]" of ([[vector bundles]] in) a [[multiplicative cohomology theory|multiplicative]]$\;$[[generalized cohomology theory]] is well-known to be a [[cohomology class|class]] on [[infinite projective space|$\mathbb{K}P^\infty$]] which restricts to [[unit|unity]] on [[projective line|$\mathbb{K}P^1$]], for [[real normed division algebra|$\mathbb{K} \in 
\{$]][[real numbers|$\mathbb{R}$]], [[complex numbers|$\mathbb{C}$]], [[quaternions|$\mathbb{H}$]]$\}$, respectively. Over the [[octonions]], [[octonions|$\mathbb{O}$]], the highest [[octonionic projective space|projective space]] to exist is [[octonionic projective plane|$\mathbb{O}P^2$]], but classes on $\mathbb{K}P^2$ restricting to unity on $\mathbb{K}P^1$ are known to still give ["$(3 dim_{\mathbb{R}}(\mathbb{K})-2)$-dimensional" orientations](complex+oriented+cohomology+theory#ReferencesFiniteStageOrientations) for $\mathbb{K} \in 
\{\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{C},\mathbb{H} \}$. We highlight that this notion of orientation thus generalizes to $\mathbb{K} = \mathbb{O}$. Using [2-component $\mathbb{K}$-spinor formalism](geometry+of+physics+--+supersymmetry#RealSpinRepresentationViaNormedDivisionAlgebra) for [[real normed division algebra|$\mathbb{K} \in 
\{\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{C},\mathbb{H}, \mathbb{O}\}$]], known from higher dimensional [[supergravity]], we give a unified construction of canonical [$(3 dim_{\mathbb{R}}(\mathbb{K})-2)$-dimensional $\mathbb{K}$-orientations](complex+oriented+cohomology+theory#ReferencesFiniteStageOrientations) of [[complex K-theory]], [[equivariant K-theory|equivariant]] with respect to [[finite group|finite]] [[subgroups]] of the [[spin groups]] $U(\mathbb{K},2)$. We close with an outlook on application to [[physics]], where these orientations serve as extraordinary [[Dold-Chern character map|character maps]] from unstable  [[equivariant Cohomotopy|equivariant]] [[Cohomotopy]] to [[equivariant K-theory|equivariant]]$\;$[[complex K-theory]], both for $\mathbb{K}$-[[Chern insulator|Chern phases]] of [[crystalline topological insulator|crystalline]] [[topological phases of matter|topological]] [[quantum materials]], as well as for [[geometry of physics -- flux quantization|proper flux quantized]] [[charges]] on [[orbifold]] [[M-branes]].

### Tautological $\mathbb{K}$-line bundle

We discuss the [[tautological line bundle|tautological $\mathbb{K}$-line bundles]] over the [[projective space]] $\mathbb{K}P^1$, for $\mathbb{K} \in \{\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{C}, \mathbb{H}, \mathbb{O}\}$ (one of [[Hurwitz theorem|the four real normed division algebras]]: the [[real numbers]], [[complex numbers]], [[quaternions]] or [[octonions]]), hence topologically over

* the tautological [[real vector bundle|real line bundle]] over  [[circle]] $\mathbb{R}P^1 \sim S^1$, 

* the tautological [[complex vector bundle|complex line bundle]] over the [[2-sphere]] $\mathbb{C}P^1 \sim S^2$

* the tautological [[quaternionic vector bundle|quaternionic line bundle]] over the [[4-sphere]] $\mathbb{H}P^1 \sim S^4$

* the tautological [[octonionic line bundle]] over the [[8-sphere]] $\mathbb{O}P^1 \sim S^8$
