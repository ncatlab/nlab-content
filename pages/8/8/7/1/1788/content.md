The key open question of contemporary mathematical physics is the elucidation of the currently elusive fundamental laws of "non-perturbative" states --- ranging from bound states as mundane as nucleons, but more generally subsuming all hadrons,  over topologically ordered quantum materials currently sought in laboratories, all the way to the remote goal of understanding background-free quantum gravity.
