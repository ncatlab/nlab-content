Here in the first step we inserted (eq:InductionStepForCounterterms), in the second step we used that in the [[HÃ¶rmander topology]] the [[product of distributions]] preserves limits in each variable (...), in the third step we used that by the causal nature of $\chi_i$ the two factors of the [[star product]] are in [[causal order]] 
so that we may alternatively use the [[Wick algebra]]-product (by [this prop.](Wick+algebra#CausalOrderingTimeOrderedProductOnRegular)), in the fourth step we applied (eq:TimeOrderedProductsAwayFromDiagonalByInduction), and finally we 
rewrote as in (eq:RenormalizedSMatrixAsLimitOfEffectiveSMatricesEvaluatedOnProjection), for emphasis.
