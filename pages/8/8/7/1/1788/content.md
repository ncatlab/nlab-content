**Renormalization of Wilson Loop Observables via Hypothesis h**

While it remains widely embraced tradition in physics to pretend that quantum field theories are specified by a Lagrangian density or action functional, it is a time-honored open secret that, even locally, the quantum observables depend on further *renormalization* choices. A basic but fundamental example are the Wilson loop observables in abelian Chern-Simons theory (equivalently: the braiding phase observables of FQH anyons), whose now standard renormalization by link framings is not derivable from the Chern-Simons form as such. Here we recall a recent non-Lagrangian construction of Chern-Simons quantum observables (via topological flux quantization in 2-Cohomotopy instead of 2-Cohomology: "Hypothesis h"), and highlight how this is a ("UV"-)complete quantum theory where the expected framing renormalization choice emerges intrinsically (and interestingly: as a manifestation of the Pontrjagin theorem in geometric topology).
