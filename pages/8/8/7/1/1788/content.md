\begin{remark}
The analogous conclusion holds also for [[light front quantization]], with the role of the time coordinate $x^0$ now played by the light front parameter $x^+$, for 
$$
  x^\pm \coloneqq (x^0 \pm x^d)/\sqrt{2}
  \,.
$$

Here the light-front [[canonical momentum]] to a field $\phi$ is (cf. [Burkardt 1996 table 2.1](light+front+quantization#Burkardt96) for the following equations):
$$
  \pi 
    \,=\, 
  \frac
    { \partial L }
    { \partial (\partial_+ \phi) }
  \mathrlap{\,,}
$$
which for [[Lagrangian densities]] with standard [[kinetic energy]] term 
$$
  L 
    \,=\, 
  \partial_+ \phi \, \partial_0 \phi 
    \,-\, 
  \tfrac{1}{2} (\vec \nabla_\perp \phi)^2 - V(\phi)
$$
comes out as
$$
  \pi 
    \,=\, 
  \partial_- \phi
  \mathrlap{\,.}
$$
While the nature of this light front momentum in canonical quantization (where it is a [[second class constraint]]) is quite different from the nature of the canonical momentum in instant form, at the end the equal-LF-time commutation relation has the same form:
$$
  \big[
     \widehat{\pi}(x^+, x^-, \vec x_\perp)
     ,\,
     \widehat{\phi}(x^+, y^-, \vec y_\perp)
  \big]
  =
  -\mathrm{i}\hbar
  \delta(x^- - y^-)
  \delta^2(\vec x_\perp - \vec y_\perp)
  \mathrlap{\,.}
$$
Finally, the above Schwinger-Dyson argument, just with the time coordinate $x^0$ replaced by the light front parameter $x^+$, reproduces this in the form
\[
  \label{LightFrontUnIntegratedSchwingerDysonForComputingCCRsViaMomenta}
  \begin{array}{l}
  \underset{\underset{\epsilon\to 0}{\longrightarrow}}{\lim}
  \Big\langle
    \pi\big(y^+ + \epsilon, x^-, \vec x_\perp\big)
    \,
    \phi\big(y^+, y^-, \vec y_\perp\big)
    \;-\;
    \pi\big(y^+ - \epsilon, x^-, \vec x_\perp\big)
    \,
    \phi\big(y^+, y^-, \vec y_\perp\big)
  \Big\rangle
  \\
  \;=\;
  -\mathrm{i}\hbar 
  \,
  \delta(x^- - y^-)
  \delta^{d-1}(\vec x_\perp - \vec y_{\perp})
  \mathrlap{\,.}
  \end{array}
\]

###### Proposition
**(Pasting Law for Pullbacks in a Cube)**
\linebreak
Suppose we have a commutative cube in a category:

\begin{tikzcd}[sep = scriptsize]
{W'} && {Z'} \\
& {X'} && {Y'} \\
W && Z \\
& X && Y
\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-3]
\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-2]
\arrow[from=1-1, to=3-1]
\arrow[from=1-3, to=2-4]
\arrow[from=1-3, to=3-3]
\arrow[crossing over, from=2-2, to=2-4]
\arrow[from=2-4, to=4-4]
\arrow[from=3-1, to=3-3]
\arrow[from=3-1, to=4-2]
\arrow[from=3-3, to=4-4]
\arrow[from=4-2, to=4-4]
\arrow[crossing over, from=2-2, to=4-2]
\end{tikzcd}

Denote the cube faces by F (Front), B (Back), U (Up), D (Down), L (Left), and R (Right) (this is Rubik's cube Singmaster notation).

a. Assume F and D are pullback squares. Then the following are equivalent:

  1.  The total rectangle from $W'\to Z'$ to $X\to Y$ is a pullback.

  1.  T and B are pullback squares.

  1.  T or B is a pullback square.

b. Assume F, D, R are pullback squares (these are the faces sharing $Y$ as a common vertex). Then all three other faces B, T, L are also pullback squares if at least one of them is.

a'. Assume T and B are pushout squares. Then the following are equivalent:

  1.  The total rectangle from $W'\to Z'$ to $X\to Y$ is a pushout.

  1.  F and D are pushout squares.

  1.  F or D is a pushout square.

b'. Assume B, T, L are pushout squares (these are the faces sharing $W'$ as a common vertex). Then all three other faces F, D, R are also pushout squares if at least one of them is.

\begin{proof}
We only show a and b (for a' and b' are their duals).
Part a follows directly from Proposition \ref{GeneralPastingLaw}.
To see part b, consider the subgroup of order three of cube symmetries generated by a 120° rotation along the axis that goes from $W'$ to $Y$. If we let this group act on the statement of part a, we obtain three different versions of part a. Now combine these with the hypotheses of part b to obtain the claim.
\end{proof}
