Let $X$ be a [[smooth manifold]].

Write 

$$
  \Omega^{2\bullet}_{cl}(X)
  \;\;
  \in
  \;
  CRings
$$

for the [[commutative ring]] of [[even number|even]]-degree [[differential forms]] on $X$, under the [[wedge product]] of differential forms. This is naturally a [[graded commutative algebra]], graded by form degree, but since we consider only forms in even degree it is actually a plain [[commutative ring]], too, after forgetting the grading.

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, consider the [[matrix algebra]] with [[coefficients]] in this ring, which is evidently [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the algebra of even-degree differential forms [[Lie algebra valued differential forms|with values in]] $n \times n$-matrices with [[real number]]-[[coefficients]]:

$$
  Mat_{n \times n} 
  \big(
    \Omega^{2\bullet}_{cl}(X)
  \big)
  \;\;
  \simeq
  \;\;
  \Omega^{2\bullet}_{cl}
  \big(
    Mat_{n \times n}( \mathbb{R} )
  \big)
  \,.
$$

Let $R \in Mat_{n \times n}\Big(\Omega^{2\bu}_{cl}\big(X; \big)\Big)$ denotes the [[curvature form]], a [[differential 2-form]] with
