- problem with traditional flux quantization

- EM flux observables via $\mathscr{A} \equiv \mathbb{C}P^\infty$

- rational model of $\mathbb{C}P^\infty$ is EM-flux density

- consider instead $\mathscr{A} \equiv \mathbb{C}P^1 \subset \mathbb{C}P^\infty$

- rational model of $\mathbb{C}P^1$ is CS-flux density!

- idea: redo all flux observables under this replacement

- generalize to covariantization and punctured surfaces
