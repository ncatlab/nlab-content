**Motivation.**

- FQH as potential TQC platform -- if anyons can be controlled

- but persistent mystery of its topological order

- key: topological states carried by magnetic flux quanta

- but flux quantization inconsistent in effective CS description!

so let's have a new look at flux quantization

**Exotic Topological Flux Quanta**

- EM classifying space and vortices

- EM flux observables via $\mathscr{A} \equiv \mathbb{C}P^\infty$

- rational model of $\mathbb{C}P^\infty$ is EM-flux density

- consider instead $\mathscr{A} \equiv \mathbb{C}P^1 \subset \mathbb{C}P^\infty$

- rational model of $\mathbb{C}P^1$ is CS-flux density!

- idea: redo all flux observables under this replacement

  guaranteed to capture the correct effective global fields

- generalize to covariantization and punctured surfaces

- quantum states form irreps of $\pi_1$ of flux moduli (local systems)

- algebraic topology: toolbox for computing such groups


**Flux quantized in 2-Cohomotopy**

- first case, $\Sigma^2 = \mathbb{R}^2$ $\Rightarrow$ fractional statistics

- second case $\Sigma^2 = T^2$ $\Rightarrow$ topological order

- third case $\Sigma^2 = Annulus$ $\Rightarrow$ edge modes

- so this does quack like effective FQH theory! 

- but subtle differences to usual CS theory $\Rightarrow$ experimentally discernible

- new prediction: possibility of non-abelian *defect* anyons

**Conclusion**
