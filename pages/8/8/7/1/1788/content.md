### Numbered equations

This is the first equation (ever)

\[
  1+1 = 2 \label{first}
  \,.
\]

What you have just witnessed was equation number.. \eqref{first}.


### Stacks

This is a stack:

$$
  { {\Omega^1} \atop {\oplus \Omega^2}}
$$

(of symbols, that it).


### Numbered lists

<p>Here is an ordered list:</p>
<ol><li>Here is the first item.</li>
<li>Here is the second item.</li></ol>
<p>The difference between the previous items and the following ones is so remarkable that I want to take a break for a moment and remark upon it.</p>
<ol start="3"><li>OK, now here is the third item.</li>
<li>Item (4) obviates the need for item (5).</li>
<li value="6">And therefore we go on to item (6).</li>
<li>This is now item (7), automatically.</li></ol>
<p>And that's the whole list!</p>

Testing ... $\int_{0}^{1} \sin(3t) t^2 \mathrm{dt}$.

Let's quote some maths:

I'm not sure, but I think you might be trying to make the quoting too smart. Dumber is probably better than smarter.

For example, instead of assuming a math mode is part of the previous quote, it might be better to assume it is not UNLESS the quote continues immediately and explicitly right after the math mode. For

>Here is a quote followed by some math mode
$$E = m c^2$$
>To make the math mode part of the quote, it should be followed immediate by a following quote.

>Even if it is a blank quote line
$$E = m c^2$$
