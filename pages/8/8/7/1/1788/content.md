## Idea

The Gram--Schmidt process is an [[algorithm]] which takes as input an ordered [[basis]] of an [[inner product space]] and produces as output an ordered [[orthonormal basis]]. 

In terms of [[matrix|matrices]], the Gram--Schmidt process is a procedure of factorization of a invertible matrix $M$ in the [[general linear group]] $GL_n(\mathbb{R})$ (or $GL_n(\mathbb{C})$) as a [[matrix product|product]] $M = U T$ where $T$ is an upper triangular matrix and $U$ is an orthonormal (or unitary) matrix; as such it is a special case of the more general [[Iwasawa decomposition]] for a (connected) semisimple [[Lie group]]. 

Since the factorization depends smoothly on the parameters, the Gram--Schmidt procedure enables the reduction of the structure group of an inner product [[vector bundle]] (e.g., the [[tangent bundle]] of a [[Riemannian manifold]] or a [[KÃ¤hler manifold]]) from $GL_n$ to the [[orthogonal group]] $O_n$ (or the [[unitary group]] $U_n$). 


## Gram--Schmidt process on Hilbert spaces 
  {#GramSchmidtOnHilbertSpaces}

In this section, "basis" is understood to signify an ordered independent set whose [[linear span]] is [[dense subspace|dense]] in a [[Hilbert space]] $H$ seen as a [[metric space]]. We will describe the Gram--Schmidt process as applied to a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space for some [[cardinal]] $d$ with a basis $v_0, v_1, \ldots$ consisting of $d$ vectors.

The orthonormal basis $u_0, u_1, \ldots$ produced as output is defined recursively by a) subtracting the orthogonal projection to the closed subspace generated by all previous vectors and b) normalizing. We denote the orthogonal projection onto a closed subspace $A$ by $\pi_A\colon H\to A$ and the normalization $v/\|v\|$ of a vector $v \in H$ by $N(v)$. For [[ordinals]] $\alpha \lt d$ define

$$u_\alpha \coloneqq N\left(v_\alpha - \pi_{S_\alpha}(v_\alpha)\right)$$

where $S_\alpha$ is the closure of the span of $\{v_\beta: \beta \lt \alpha\}$, noting that the projection $\pi_{S_\alpha}$ is known to exist, since $H$ is complete. This can be rewritten more explicitly using transfinite recursion as

$$u_\alpha =  N\left(v_\alpha - \sum_{\beta \lt \alpha} \langle v_\alpha, u_\beta\rangle u_\beta\right)$$

where the sum on the right is well defined by the Bessel inequality, i.e. only countably many coefficients are non-zero and they are square-summable. A simple (transfinite) inductive argument shows that the $u_\alpha$ are unit vectors orthogonal to each other, and that the span of $\left\{u_\beta \colon \beta \lt \alpha\right\}$ is equal to the span of $\left\{v_\beta \colon \beta \lt \alpha\right\}$ for $\alpha \leq d$. Therefore $u_0, u_1, \ldots$ is an orthonormal basis of $H$.
