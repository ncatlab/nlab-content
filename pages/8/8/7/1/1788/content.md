**From complete quantum field theories**
\linebreak
**to higher topos ontology, and back**

Physicists mindset: Care about understanding the world. Embrace the foundational math that comes with this; disregard mathematics as sport.

Glory and misery of contemporary QFT: Perturbation theory. Works wonders as far as it goes. But goes only infinitesimally far.

Mathematically: Perturbation theory is the geometry of *infinitesimal* spaces. Amenable to ordinary algebra and analysis (formal power series).

The Millennium problem: Complete QFT. Non-perturbative & global field geometry. Needs the geometry of the field space. Just not available in traditional diff geo textbooks. Hence even basic notions are traditionally missing.

Claim: (Cohesive Higher) Topos Theory is the missing global Geometry of Physics.

Topos: Where physics may *take place*.

Historical tidbit: Lawvere started out working on continuum mechanics. Went from asking "what is a vector field, really?" to laying foundations for Topos Theory, in order to speak about "Toposes of Laws of Motion".

But beyond classical continuum mechanics, there is gauge fields, topological charges, orbifolding (symmetry protection), and quantum states. Adjoining these to the picture brings in *higher topos theory*, also: *geometric homotopy theory*.

| physics | topos |
|---------|-------|
| gauge principle | homotopy |


Commonplace in theoretical physics to allude to "complete QFTs". As in "M-theory is (going to be) the completion of 11D SuGra". But no traditional concept of what such complete theories would actually be. Claim: Higher Topos Theory is the missing language.

Just like Riemannian geometry is the languge for speaking about gravity, or differential forms is the language for speaking about electromagnetic fields, or group/representation theory is the language for speaking about symmetries. You can do without, but you won't get very far.

Now, every topos is a category of geometric spaces of sorts. But many toposes (those usually highlighted in introductions to the topic, no less) are just like categories of covering spaces of a fixed space $X$. These are clearly too small a scenery for general physics, in fact they are called *petit toposes*. 

Other toposes are categories of *all* generalized spaces exhibiting a given notion of geometry (differential, infinitesimal, analytic, super, ... etc.). These are called *gros toposes*. These are potentially geometries of physics.

We may then ask: What types of *gros* higher toposes are actual geometries of physics? These must contain besides *concrete* spaces (physical spacetime) also superspaces (of fermionic fields) as well as moduli spaces for *gauge* fields.

Such geometric "qualities" are encoded by systems of *adjoint modal operators* exhibited by a higher topos exhibiting "cohesion".

These are higher toposes carrying a progression of adjoint modalities. 

But every topos also is a language of formal logic (namely of exactly the laws that hold true in its geometry of physics).
In this logic, the cohesive modalities are a progression of resolution of oppositions.
From this logical perspective thse neatly matches idealistic ontology ("objective logic").

So, in asking for fundamental physics we end up asking about natural foundations of mathematics. 

Seems only natural: That the most fundamental physics involves the most fundamental math.

Two facets: The general abstract and the exceptional particular.
Eg. Category of groups is general abstract. In there we find the exceptional groups.

Similarly: Solid cohesive toposes accommodate all supergeometry. In there 11D supergravity with its 5-brane is an exceptional structure.

And in higher cohesive topos, 11D supergravity does find a global completion.
