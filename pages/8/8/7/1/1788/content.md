For $d = 2$ the components that [[natural transformations]] between [[TQFT]] [[3-functors]] assign to [[surfaces]] are [[3-morphisms]] between [[2-morphisms]] making "tin-can diagrams" (vividly so when using [[globular set|globular]] [[geometric shape for higher structures|shapes of higher morphisms]]) as shown in the last row of the following table (from [Schreiber 2006](#Schreiber2006)):
