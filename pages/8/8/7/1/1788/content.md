**Quaternionic Ravenel Orientation of Orbi-K-theory and M5 charges**

In [[theoretical physics]], [[Chern insulator|Chern phases]] of [[topological phases of matter|topological]] [[quantum materials]] as well as [[brane]] [[charges]] on [[11D supergravity]] [[orbifolds]] have famously been argued to be classified by ([[orbifold K-theory|orbifold]]) [[topological K-theory]], or possibly by other [[Whitehead-generalized cohomology theory|stable]] and [[complex-oriented cohomology theory|complex-oriented]] [[cohomology theories]], such as [[elliptic cohomology]] or [[cobordism cohomology|stable Cobordism]]. However, closer inspection reveals the more fine-grained "[fragile](topological+phase+of+matter#ReferencesUnstableClassificationOfTopologicalPhases)" classification in both cases to plausibly be in ([[equivariant Cohomotopy|orbifold]]-)[[Cohomotopy]], which is the primordial "unstable" and [[non-abelian cohomology|non-abelian generalized cohomology]]. Coarsening should take the latter (fragile) to the former (stable) cohomology along an extraordinary character map. But what then is the role of [[complex-oriented cohomology|complex orientation]] in the stable side?

We observe here that (1.) over nodal lines in the Brillouin torus, and on probe M5-branes in 11D spacetime, the cohomotopical phases/charges are factored through the complex/quaternionic Hopf fibration, and (2.) measuring that situation in stable cohomology means exactly to ask for complex/quaternionic orientation over low dimensions, in the sense of Ravenel and Hopkins.

Then we give a concrete realization of the canonical complex/quaternionic Ravenel orientation on $Sp(1)$/$Sp(2)$-equivariant K-theory, using 2-component complex/quaternionic spinor formalism.

A universal [[real oriented cohomology theory|real]], [[complex oriented cohomology theory|complex]] or [[quaternionic oriented cohomology theory|quaternionic]] "[[orientation in generalized cohomology|orientation]]" of ([[vector bundles]] in) a [[multiplicative cohomology theory|multiplicative]]$\;$[[generalized cohomology theory]] is well-known to be a [[cohomology class|class]] on [[infinite projective space|$\mathbb{K}P^\infty$]] which restricts to [[unit|unity]] on [[projective line|$\mathbb{K}P^1$]], for [[real normed division algebra|$\mathbb{K} \in 
\{$]][[real numbers|$\mathbb{R}$]], [[complex numbers|$\mathbb{C}$]], [[quaternions|$\mathbb{H}$]]$\}$, respectively. Over the [[octonions]], [[octonions|$\mathbb{O}$]], the highest [[octonionic projective space|projective space]] to exist is [[octonionic projective plane|$\mathbb{O}P^2$]], but classes on $\mathbb{K}P^2$ restricting to unity on $\mathbb{K}P^1$ are known to still give ["$(3 dim_{\mathbb{R}}(\mathbb{K})-2)$-dimensional" orientations](complex+oriented+cohomology+theory#ReferencesFiniteStageOrientations) for $\mathbb{K} \in 
\{\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{C},\mathbb{H} \}$. We highlight that this notion of orientation thus generalizes to $\mathbb{K} = \mathbb{O}$. Using [2-component $\mathbb{K}$-spinor formalism](geometry+of+physics+--+supersymmetry#RealSpinRepresentationViaNormedDivisionAlgebra) for [[real normed division algebra|$\mathbb{K} \in 
\{\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{C},\mathbb{H}, \mathbb{O}\}$]], known from higher dimensional [[supergravity]], we give a unified construction of canonical [$(3 dim_{\mathbb{R}}(\mathbb{K})-2)$-dimensional $\mathbb{K}$-orientations](complex+oriented+cohomology+theory#ReferencesFiniteStageOrientations) of [[complex K-theory]], [[equivariant K-theory|equivariant]] with respect to [[finite group|finite]] [[subgroups]] of the [[spin groups]] $U(\mathbb{K},2)$. We close with an outlook on application to [[physics]], where these orientations serve as extraordinary [[Dold-Chern character map|character maps]] from unstable  [[equivariant Cohomotopy|equivariant]] [[Cohomotopy]] to [[equivariant K-theory|equivariant]]$\;$[[complex K-theory]], both for $\mathbb{K}$-[[Chern insulator|Chern phases]] of [[crystalline topological insulator|crystalline]] [[topological phases of matter|topological]] [[quantum materials]], as well as for [[geometry of physics -- flux quantization|proper flux quantized]] [[charges]] on [[orbifold]] [[M-branes]].

### Tautological $\mathbb{K}$-line bundle

We discuss the [[tautological line bundle|tautological $\mathbb{K}$-line bundles]] over the [[projective space]] $\mathbb{K}P^1$, for $\mathbb{K} \in \{\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{C}, \mathbb{H}, \mathbb{O}\}$ (one of [[Hurwitz theorem|the four real normed division algebras]]: the [[real numbers]], [[complex numbers]], [[quaternions]] or [[octonions]]), hence topologically over

* the tautological [[real vector bundle|real line bundle]] over  [[circle]] $\mathbb{R}P^1 \sim S^1$, 

* the tautological [[complex vector bundle|complex line bundle]] over the [[2-sphere]] $\mathbb{C}P^1 \sim S^2$

* the tautological [[quaternionic vector bundle|quaternionic line bundle]] over the [[4-sphere]] $\mathbb{H}P^1 \sim S^4$

* the tautological [[octonionic line bundle]] over the [[8-sphere]] $\mathbb{O}P^1 \sim S^8$
