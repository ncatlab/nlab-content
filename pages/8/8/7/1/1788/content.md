Every wiki needs a sandbox! Just test between the horizontal rules below (`***` in the source) and don't worry about messing things up.

<div id="section1"></div>

A link to the [[Sandbox]].

Another link to the [[Sandbox]].


1. {: .num_enuma #first style="color: red;"} The first item
2. {: .num_enuma #second style="font-style: italic;"} The second item

Can we refer to \ref{first} or \ref{second}?

Why has this **_elementary topos_{: style="font-style: normal"}** stopped working?

<a id="anchor"></a>

$$
\widehat{\mathbb{C}} \, \underoverset{\underoverset{f_{*}}{\perp }{\rightarrow }}{\underoverset{\perp }{f_{!}}{\rightarrow }}{\longleftarrow \scriptsize f^{*} - \,} \widehat{\mathbb{D}}
$$

$$
\mathcal{E}
\underoverset{\underoverset{f_*}{\perp}{\rightarrow}}{\underoverset{\perp}{f_!}{\rightarrow}}{\longleftarrow {\scriptsize f^*} -}
\mathcal{F}
$$

***

What about anchors in lists?

* <p id="refa"></p>
  The first
* <a id="refb"></a>
  The second
* <span id="refe"></span>
  The second and a halfth
* <p></p>
  +-- {: #refc}

  The third

  +-- {: #refd}
  =--
  The fourth

* {: #reff }The sixth


By a mechanical process, this definition can be turned into a definition of 'internal field in a topos'. As compensation for the imprecision of the rest of this section, I will give the definition in detail; but if you want to skip it, the point to retain is that it *is* a mechanical process.
