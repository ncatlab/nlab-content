From complete quantum field theories to higher topos ontology and back.

Physicists mindset: Care about understanding the world. Embrace the foundational math that comes with this; disregard mathematics as sport.

Perturbative physics works on infinitesimal neighboorhoods: ordinary algebra.

Grand Millennium question: Complete QFTs. Nonperturbative physics needs the geometry of the field space. Not to be found in diff geo textbooks. Basic concepts are traditionally missing.


Topos Theory in physics provides the missing geometry of physics.

Topos: Where physics may *take place*.

Historical tidbit: Lawvere started out as a physicists, went from asking "what os a vector field, really" to laying foundations of Topos Theory, Indivisible order to speak about "Toposes of laws of motion".

But in addition there is gauge fields and topological charges and orbifolding (symmetry protection). Adding these to the picture brings in *higher* topos theory, geometric homotopy theory.

Commonplace in theoretical to allude to "complete QFTs". As in "M-theory is the completion of 11D SuGra". But no traditional concept of what such complete theories would actually be. Claim: Higher Topos Theory is part of the missing language.

Just like differential forms is the language for speaking about electrimagnetic fields. You can do without, but you won't get very far.

Now, every topos is a category of geometric spaces of sorts. But many toposes (those usually highlighted in introductions to the topic, no less) are like categories of covering spaces of a fixed space $X$. These are clearly too small a scenery for general physics, in fact they are called *petit toposes*. Other toposes are categories of *all* generalized spaces modeled on some notion of Geometry (differential, super, analytic, ... etc). These are *gros toposes* 

We may then ask: What types of *gros* higher toposes are contexts for physics. Need: gauge (shape) and concreteness (sharp). Cohesion. Then also fermions: solid cohesion.

These are higher toposes carrying a progression of adjoint modalities. The structure expressed by these neatly matches idealistic ontology ("objective logic").

So, in asking for fundamental physics we end up asking about natural foundations of mathematics. 

Seems only natural: That the most fundamental physics involves the most fundamental math.

Two facets: The general abstract and the exceptional particular.
Eg. Category of groups is general abstract. In there we find the exceptional groups.

Similarly: Solid cohesive toposes accommodate all supergeometry. In there 11D supergravity with its 5-brane is an exceptional structure.

And in higher cohesive topos, 11D supergravity does find a global completion.
