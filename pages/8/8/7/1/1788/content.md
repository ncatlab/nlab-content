Every wiki needs a sandbox! Just test _below_ and don't worry about messing things up.

The sandbox had gotten a little full, making it hard to use as a sandbox.  So [[lab elf|we've]] given it a bit of a clear out.  You can look at the old stuff by going [back in the history](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/revision/Sandbox/123).
