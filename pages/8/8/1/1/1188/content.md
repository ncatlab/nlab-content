## Idea ##

Beiing the [[(infinity,1)-category|(∞,1)-categorical]] generalization of [[accessible category]], the notion of an _accessible_ [[(∞,1)-category]] is a means to handle [[large category|large]] $(\infty,1)$-categories. 

An _accessible_ $(\infty,1)$-category is one which may be [[large category|large]], but can entirely be _accessed_ as an $(\infty,1)$-category of "conglomerates of objects" in a small $(\infty,1)$-category -- precisely: that it is a category of $\kappa$-small [[ind-object]]s in the some small $(\infty,1)$-category $C$.


## Definition ##

Let $\kappa$ be a [[cardinal number|regular cardinal]]. An [[(∞,1)-category]] $C$ is **accessible** if it satisfies the following equivalent conditions

* $C$ is equivalent to the $(\infty,1)$-category  $Ind_\kappa(C^0)$ of [[ind-object in an (infinity,1)-category|ind-objects]] for small $C^0$;

* $C$ admits small $\kappa$-[[filtered colimits]] and contains an essentially small full subcategory which consists of $\kappa$-[[compact object in an (infinity,1)-category|compact]] objects and generates $C$ under small $\kappa$-filtered colimits.
