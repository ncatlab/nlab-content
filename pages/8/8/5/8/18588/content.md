## Definition

A __continuous simple closed [[curve]]__, or __Jordan curve__, in a [[topological space]] (or [[convergence space]], [[locale]], etc) $X$ is the [[image]] of a [[continuous map|continuous]] [[injection]] to $X$ from the [[unit circle]] $S^1$.  (This map itself is a continuous [[parametrization]] of the curve.)  The word 'continuous' is generally assumed, so that one speaks simply of a __simple closed curve__.  (If 'closed' is removed, then the domain is taken to be the [[unit interval]] $B^1$ instead of $S^1$.  If 'simple' is removed, then the map is no longer assumed injective.  If the image alone is not sufficient data, then the word 'parametrized' may be added to indicate the map itself while thinking of the map as its image.)

Similarly, a __Jordan [[surface]]__ in $X$ is the image of a continuous injection to $X$ from the [[unit sphere]] $S^2$.  This can be generalized to higher-dimensional [[spheres]] or other domains, so long as there is an appropriate term to use in place of 'curve' and 'surface'.  In particular, if $X$ has [[dimension]] $n$ (in some understood sense), then a __Jordan [[hypersurface]]__ in $X$ is the image of a continuous injection to $X$ from $S^{n-1}$.
