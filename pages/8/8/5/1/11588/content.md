This page is about the $\tau$-function in the study of [[soliton]]s and [[integrable model]]s, as invented by Kyoto school. There will be a separate entry for a different notion of [[Ramanujan tau function]].

## Motivation

Quoting Zabrodin, [arxiv/1211.4428](http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.4428),

> "In nature", $\tau$-functions or their logarithms appear as partition functions, different kinds of correlators and their generating functions, and effective actions as functions of coupling constants.

## Formal idea

Sato and Segal have formulated the $\tau$-function as the [[Fredholm determinant]] of certain 1-parameter family of operators on separable Hilbert space.

#### Other formal interpretations

$\tau$-functions appear as dependent variables in [[Hirota bilinear equation]]s 
associated to integrable hierarchies.

Tau functions can also be associated to the isomonodromic problems.

[[Witten conjecture]] is about the equivalence of two approaches to gravity, and boils down to a connection of the $\tau$-function for the KP hierarchy and theory of Riemann surfaces. It has been proved by Kontsevich who also introduced related family of matrix models.

> In this paper we establish relations between three enumerative geometry tau-functions, namely the Kontsevich-Witten, Hurwitz and Hodge tau-functions. The relations allow us to describe the tau-functions in terms of matrix integrals, Virasoro constraints and Kac-Schwarz operators. All constructed operators belong to the algebra (or group) of symmetries of the KP hierarchy.
