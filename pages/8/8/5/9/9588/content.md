## Idea

There are several [[cohomology theories]] that are being called _Morava E-theory_ at times:

* $B P\langle n\rangle$, the truncated [[Brown-Peterson spectrum]];

* $E(n)$, the [[Johnson-Wilson spectrum]], a localization of $B P \langle n\rangle$ at $v_n$;

* $\widehat{E(n)}$ the complete Johnson-Wilson spectrum

* $E(k,\Gamma)$ the [[Lubin-Tate spectrum]] associated to the universal deformation of a [[formal group law]] $\Gamma$ over $k$.

## Properties

### As a localization of the $\infty$-group $\infty$-ring on $B^{n+1}\mathbb{Z}_p$

There is a [[Snaith theorem]] for the [[homotopy fixed points]] of 
the Morava E-theory spectrum $E_n$ for the canonical [[infinity-action|action]] of a certain group, which identifies these with a localization of the [[∞-group ∞-ring]] on the [[n-group|(n+1)-group]] $B^{n+1} \mathbb{Z}_p$. ([Westerland 12, theorem 1.2](#Westerland12))

See at _[Snatih-like theorem for Morava E-theory](Snaith+theorem#ForMoravaETheory)_ for more.
