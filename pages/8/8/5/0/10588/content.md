## Idea

An _elliptic spectrum_ is a [[spectrum]] which [[Brown representability theorem|represents]] an [[elliptic cohomology theory]]. 

## Definition

For $E$ a [[ring spectrum]], write $E^\bullet(\ast)$ for its coefficient ring and generally $E^\bullet(X)$ for its [[generalized cohomology theory|generalized]] [[cohomology ring]] over any $X$.

###### Definition

An _elliptic spectrum_ is a [[triple]] consisting of 

1. an [[elliptic curve]] $A$ over the coefficient ring $E^\bullet(\ast)$;

1. an [[even cohomology theory|even]] [[periodic ring spectrum]] $E$; 

1. an [[equivalence]]

   $$
     Spec E^\bullet(BU(1)) \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} Pic_A^0
   $$

   between the [[spectrum of a commutative ring|algebraic spectrum]] of the $E$-[[cohomology ring]] over the [[classifying space]] for [[complex line bundles]] (see at _[[complex oriented cohomology theory]]_) and the [[formal Picard group]] $Pic_A^0$ of $A$.

This is due to ([Ando-Hopkins-Strickland01, def. 1.2](AndoHopkinsStrickland01)). See for instance also ([Gepner 05, def. 15](#Gepner05)).

###### Remark

Originally (and still in many or even most references), def. \ref{EllipticSpectrum} is stated with the [[formal Picard group]] $Pic_A^0$ replaced by the [[formal completion]] $\hat A$ of $A$ at its neutral element.

These two versions of the definition in itself are equivalent, since [[elliptic curves]] are self-[[dual abelian varieties]] equipped with a canonical [[isomorphism]] $A\simeq Pic_X^0$exhibited by the [[Poincar√© line bundle]].

But for the development of the theory, notably for application to [[equivariant elliptic cohomology]], for the relation of [[elliptic cohomology]] to [[loop group representations]] etc., it is crucial to understand that $E^\bullet(B U(1))$ is the space of [[sections]] of a [[line bundle]] over a (formal) [[moduli space]] of [[line bundles]] on the elliptic curve, instead of on the elliptic curve itself.

Indeed, generally for $G$ a [[compact Lie group]], then $E^\bullet(B G)$ is the space of sections of the [[WZW model]]-[[line bundle]] on the (formal) [[moduli space of flat connections]] on $G$-[[principal bundles]] over the elliptic curve. This is the central statement at _[[equivariant elliptic cohomology]]_. As the appearance of the [[WZW model]] here shows, this is also crucial for understanding the role of elliptic spectra in [[quantum field theory]]/[[string theory]], see at _[equivariant elliptic cohomology -- Interpretation in Quantum field theory/String theory](equivariant%20elliptic%20cohomology#InterpretationInQuantumFieldTheory)_ for more on this.

Moreover, understanding $Spec E^\bullet(BU(1))$ as being about [[moduli space of (higher) line bundles|moduli of line bundles]] on the elliptic curve is crucial for understanding the generalization of the concept of elliptic spectra, for instance to [[K3-spectra]]. This is indicated in the following table
