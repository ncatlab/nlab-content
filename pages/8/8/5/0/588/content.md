A **totally ordered set**, also known as a **linearly ordered set** or **toset**, is a [[poset]] such that for any pair of elements $x$ and $y$ we either have $x \le y$ or $y \le x$.

The category of finite nonempty (or more precisely, 'occupied') totally ordered sets and order-preserving maps is called $\Delta$, the [[simplex category]]. 

The category of <i>all</i> finite totally ordered sets and order-preserving maps is called $\Delta_a$, the **augmented** simplex category.
