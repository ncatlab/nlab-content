Generalized [[homotopical cohomology theory]] of [[sheaf|sheaves]] with values in a [[model category]] is naturally formulated in terms of morphisms in the [[homotopy category]] of a suitable [[homotopical category]] of sheaves, as indicated at [[infinity-stack homotopically]]. Typically the weak equivalences in this homotopical category are _locally_ the weak equivalences in the target category such that the category of sheaves is not quite or not easily turned into a [[model category]]. Still, it is often a [[category of fibrant objects]] which is like a model category without any assumption on cofibrations but with the assumption that all objects are fibrant.

The article introduces this concept of [[category of fibrant objects]], establishes the crucial structures available in such a category (notably the _factorization lemma_ and the characterization of the homotopy category by one-step spans) and then studies the cohomology of sheaves with coefficients in combinatorial [[spectrum|spectra]].

This work by K. Brown later led to [[Andre Joyal]] and Jardine's construction of the [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]]. This [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presentation]] of an [[(infinity,1)-category of (infinity,1)-sheaves]] is therefore sometimes called the _Brown-Joyal-Jardine model_ (for instance in [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT]]).
