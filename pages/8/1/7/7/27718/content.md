## Idea

**Displayed coinductive types** are a generalization of [[coinductive types]] where the output of a method is a higher-dimensional [[bridge type|bridge]] cube version of itself, similarly to how a [[higher inductive type]] has constructors whose output is a higher-dimensional version of itself. 

## Examples

* Using [[unary bridge types]] $(\mathrm{Br}_A(x))_{x:A}$, the type of augmented semi-simplicial types $U^{\Delta_{\alpha+}^\op}$ in a [[type universe]] $U$ is a displayed coinductive type cogenerated by 

  * a function $Z^+:U^{\Delta_{\alpha+}^\op} \to U$ and 

  * a dependent function 
$$S^+:\prod_{X:U^{\Delta_{\alpha+}^\op}} \mathrm{Br}_{U^{\Delta_{\alpha+}^\op}}(X)$$
