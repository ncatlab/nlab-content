## Idea

A jet can be thought of as the infinitesimal germ of a [[section]] of some [[bundle]] or of a map between spaces. Jets are a coordinate free version of Taylor-polynomials and Taylor series.

## Definition

### Concrete

For 

$$
  p \coloneqq E \to X
$$ 

a [[surjective submersion]] of [[smooth manifolds]] and $k \in \mathbb{N}$, the bundle 

$$
  J^k P \to X
$$ 

of **order-$k$ jets of sections of $p$** is the bundle whose [[fiber]] over a point $x \in X$ is the space of equivalence classes of [[germ]]s of [[section]]s of $p$, where two germs are considered equivalent if their first $k$ partial [[derivative]]s at $x$ coincide.

In the case when $p$ is a trivial bundle $p:X\times Y \to X$ its sections are canonically in bijection with maps from $X$ to $Y$ and two sections have the same partial derivatives iff the partial derivatives of the corresponding maps from $X$ to $Y$ agree. So in this case the [[jet space]] $J^k P$ is called the space of jets of maps from $X$ to $Y$ and commonly denoted with $J^k(X,Y)$.

In order to pass to $k \to \infty$ to form the _infinite jet bundle_ $J^\infty P$ one forms the [[projective limit]] over the finite-order jet bundles, 

$$
  J^\infty E \coloneqq \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_k J^k E
  = 
  \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}
  \left(
    \cdots J^3 E \to J^2 E \to J^1 E \to E
  \right)
$$

but one has to decide in which category of [[infinite-dimensional manifolds]] to take this limit:

1. one may form the limit formally, i.e. in [[pro-manifolds]]. This is what is implicit for instance in [Anderson, p.3-5](#Anderson);

1. one may form the limit in [[Fréchet manifolds]], this is farily explicit in ([Saunders 89, chapter 7](#Saunders89)). See at _[Fr&#233;chet manifold -- Projective limits of finite-dimensional manifolds](Frechet+manifold#ProjectiveLimitsOfSmoothFiniteDimensionalManifolds)_. Beware that this is not equivalent to the pro-manifold structure (see the remark [here](Frechet+manifold#DifferenceBetweenProManifoldAndFrecherManifoldStructure)). It makes sense to speak of _[[locally pro-manifolds]]_.




### General abstract
 {#GeneralAbstractDefinition}

We discuss a [[general abstract]] definition of jet bundles.

Let  $\mathbf{H}$ be an [[(∞,1)-topos]] equipped with [[differential cohesion]] with [[infinitesimal shape modality]] $\Im$ (or rather a tower $\Im_k$ of such, for each infinitesimal order $k \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{\infty\}$ ).

For $X \in \mathbf{H}$, write $\Im(X)$ for the corresponding [[de Rham space]] object.

Notice that we have the canonical morphism, the $X$-component of the [[unit of a monad|unit]] of the $\Im$-[[monad]]

$$
  i \colon X \to \Im(X)
$$

("inclusion of constant paths into all infinitesimal paths").

The corresponding [[base change]] [[geometric morphism]] is

$$
  (i^\ast \dashv i_\ast)
  \;\colon\;
  \mathbf{H}_{/X}
   \stackrel{\overset{i^*}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{Jet := i_*}{\longrightarrow}}
  \mathbf{H}_{/\Im(X)}
$$


+-- {: .num_defn #GeneralAbstractDefinition}
###### Definition

The _[[jet comonad]]_ is the [[(∞,1)-comonad]] 

$$
  i^\ast i_\ast
  \;\colon\;
  \mathbf{H}_{/X}
  \longrightarrow
  \mathbf{H}_{/X}
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Since [[base change]] gives even an [[adjoint triple]] $(i_! \dashv i^\ast \dashv i_\ast)$, there is a [[left adjoint]] $T_{inf} X \times_X (-)$ to the [[jet comonad]] of def. \ref{GeneralAbstractDefinition}, 

$$
  T_{inf}X \times_X (-) \;\dashv\; Jet
$$

where $T_{inf} X$ is the [[infinitesimal disk bundle]] of $X$, see at _[differential cohesion -- infinitesimal disk bundle -- relation to jet bundles](differential+cohesion#RelationOfInfinitesimalDiskBundleToJetBundle)_

+-- {: .num_remark #LiteratureOnGeneralAbstractCharacterization}
###### Remark

In the context of [[differential geometry]] the fact that the jet bundle construction is a comonad was explicitly observed in ([Marvan 86](#Marvan86), see also [Marvan 93, section 1.1](#Marvan93), [Marvan 89](#Marvan89)). It is almost implicit in ([Krasil'shchik-Verbovetsky 98, p. 13, p. 17](#KrasilshchikVerbovetsky98), [Krasilshchik 99, p. 25](#Krasilshchik99)).

In the context of [[synthetic differential geometry]] the fact that the jet bundle construction is [[right adjoint]] to the [[infinitesimal disk bundle]] construction is ([Kock 80, prop. 2.2](#Kock80)).

{#InTheContextOf} In the context of [[algebraic geometry]] and of [[D-schemes]] as in ([BeilinsonDrinfeld, 2.3.2](#BeilinsonDrinfeld), reviewed in [Paugam, section 2.3](#Paugam)), the base change comonad formulation inf def. \ref{GeneralAbstractDefinition} was noticed in ([Lurie, prop. 0.9](#Lurie)). 


=--

In as in ([BeilinsonDrinfeld, 2.3.2](#BeilinsonDrinfeld), reviewed in[Paugam, section 2.3](#Paugam)) jet bundles are expressed dually in terms of algebras in [[D-modules]]. We now indicate how the translation works. 

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

In terms of [[differential homotopy type theory]] this means that
forming "jet types" of [[dependent types]] over $X$ is the 
[[dependent product]] operation along the unit of the [[infinitesimal shape modality]] 

$$
  jet(E) \coloneqq \underset{X \to \Im X}{\prod} E
  \,.
$$

###### Definition

A [[quasicoherent (∞,1)-sheaf]] on $X$ is a morphism of [[(∞,2)-sheaves]]

$$
  X \to Mod
  \,.
$$

We write

$$
  QC(X) := Hom(X, Mod)
$$

for the [[stable (∞,1)-category]] of [[quasicoherent (∞,1)-sheaves]].

A _[[D-module]]_ on $X$ is a morphism of [[(∞,2)-sheaves]]

$$
  \Im (X) \to Mod
  \,.
$$

We write 

$$
  DQC(X) := Hom(\Im (X), Mod)
$$

for the [[stable (∞,1)-category]] of D-modules.

=--

The **Jet algebra** functor is the [[left adjoint]] to the [[forgetful functor]] from [[associative algebra|commutative algebra]]s over $\mathcal{D}(X)$ to those over the [[structure sheaf]] $\mathcal{O}(X)$

$$
  (Jet \dashv F)
   :
   Alg_{\mathcal{D}(X)}
    \stackrel{\overset{Jet}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{F}{\to}}
   Alg_{\mathcal{O}(X)}
  \,.
$$


## Application 

Typical [[Lagrangian]]s in [[quantum field theory]] are defined on jet bundles. Their [[variational calculus]] is governed by [[Euler-Lagrange equation]]s.
