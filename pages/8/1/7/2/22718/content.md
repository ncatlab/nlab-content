## Idea

A linear magmoid is a [[magmoids]] whose [[hom-sets]] are all [[vector spaces]] (or [[modules]]) and whose composition operation is [[bilinear map|bilinear]].  This concept is an [[oidification]] of the concept of [[nonassociative algebra|nonassociative nonunital algebra]].

## Definitions

Fix a [[commutative ring]] $K$.  (Often we want $K$ to be a [[field]], such as the field $\mathbb{C}$ of [[complex numbers]].)

A __$K$-linear magmoid__ is a [[enriched magmoid|magmoid enriched]] over $K\,$[[Mod]], the [[monoidal category]] of $K$-[[modules]] with the usual [[tensor product]].  (Note that we usually speak of $K\,$[[Vect]] instead of $K\,Mod$ when $K$ is a field.)

## Examples

* Any [[linear category]] is a linear magmoid. 

* A [[Lie algebroid]] is a linear magmoid that is not a linear category.
