I am a <a href="http://www.j-paine.org/#consultancy">freelance programmer</a>, and spend too much time repairing Web servers and spreadsheets &mdash; or, in the current hard times, looking for Web servers and spreadsheets to repair. <a href="http://www.j-paine.org/">My Website</a> says more about this and other things I do.

But I was tempted into category theory, not least by my friends Hendrik Hilberdink, <a href="http://www.imar.ro/~diacon/">R&#259;zvan Diaconescu</a>, Petros Stefaneas, and <a href="http://www.di.uminho.pt/~jbb/">Jos&#233; Bernardo Barros</a>. And their supervisor, <a href="http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/~goguen/">Joseph Goguen</a>.

I have implemented a collection of <a href="http://www.j-paine.org/cgi-bin/webcats/webcats.php">Web-based category theory demonstrations</a>, and am adapting some to nLab. If I could get funding, I'd like to make these easier for novices to learn from; and I'd also like to popularise category theory through my <a href="http://www.j-paine.org/dobbs/index.html">blog at Dr Dobbs</a>. That's partly because I find it intrinsically fascinating; but also because I feel it has huge potential in Artificial Intelligence and cognitive science. I've written about that <a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2006/11/a_categorical_manifesto.html#c018171">in an n-Category Caf&eacute; posting</a>.

Places where I think category theory could benefit AI and cognitive science include <a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2006/11/a_categorical_manifesto.html#c018173">neural networks and their relation to logic and model theory</a>, <a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2006/11/a_categorical_manifesto.html#c018180">analogical reasoning</a>, and <a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2006/11/a_categorical_manifesto.html#c018555">holographic reduced representations</a>.

I believe this partly because category theory gives us tools to "achieve independence from the often overwhelmingly complex details of how things are represented or implemented". (I am quoting Goguen's <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.13.362"><cite>A categorical manifesto</cite></a>.) For example, holographic reduced representations represent symbolic structured data as very high-dimensional vectors, storing and extracting items using operations similar to correlation and convolution. They can &mdash; and this is very interesting &mdash; use the same operations to do analogical reasoning of the kind "What is to Sweden as Paris is to France?". If we could characterise HRRs categorically, it might help us decide which properties of their representational substrate are essential, and which merely accidental.

Perhaps &mdash; I don't know whether I'm joking or not &mdash; categorical characterisations of computational systems systems could help us understand other phenomena. Could we find a universal property that a computational system satisfies if and only if it is self-aware?!

Category theory also gives us tools for unifying disparate mathematical and computational phenomena. AI and cognitive science, of course, are full of disparate mathematical and computational phenomena, usually ones whose relatedness is understood poorly. That is why I mentioned neural networks: my posting about them referred to a paper that uses elementary category theory to map concepts expressed as logic onto concepts represented in neural networks. As another example, I cited Goguen's work on analogical reasoning via "conceptual blending". Perhaps this could be unified with the analogical reasoning that HRRs do. This quote from Greg Egan's novel <cite>Incandescence</cite> expresses what I want to say:
<blockquote>
'Interesting Truths' referred to a kind of theorem which captured subtle unifying insights between broad classes of mathematical structures. In between strict isomorphism &#8212; where the same structure recurred exactly in different guises &#8212; and the loosest of poetic analogies, Interesting Truths gathered together a panoply of apparently disparate systems by showing them all to be reflections of each other, albeit in a suitably warped mirror. Knowing, for example, that multiplying two positive integers was really the same as adding their logarithms revealed an exact correspondence between two algebraic systems that was useful, but not very deep. Seeing how a more sophisticated version of the same could be established for a vast array of more complex systems &#8212; from rotations in space to the symmetries of subatomic particles &#8212; unified great tracts of physics and mathematics, without collapsing them all into mere copies of a single example.
</blockquote>

Incidentally, category theory has also inspired me to invent a way of <a href="http://www.j-paine.org/#safe_spreadsheets_fast_with_excelsior">building spreadsheets from modules</a>, and of <a href="http://www.spreadsheet-parts.org/">storing these modules on the Web</a> for anyone to download into their own spreadsheets.
