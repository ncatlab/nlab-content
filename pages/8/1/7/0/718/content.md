I am a <a href="http://www.j-paine.org/#consultancy">freelance programmer</a>, and spend too much time repairing Web servers and spreadsheets &mdash; or, in the current hard times, looking for Web servers and spreadsheets tor repair. <a href="http://www.j-paine.org/">My Website</a> says more about this and other things I do.

But I was tempted into category theory, not least by my friends Hendrik Hilberdink, <a href="http://www.imar.ro/~diacon/">R&#259;zvan Diaconescu</a>, Petros Stefaneas, and <a href="http://www.di.uminho.pt/~jbb/">Jos&#233; Bernardo Barros</a>. And &mdash; their supervisor, <a href="http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/~goguen/">Joseph Goguen</a>.

I have implemented a collection of <a href="http://www.j-paine.org/cgi-bin/webcats/webcats.php">Web-based category theory demonstrations</a>, and am adapting some to nLab. If I could get funding, I'd like to make these easier for novices to learn from; and I'd also like to popularise category theory through my <a href="http://www.j-paine.org/dobbs/index.html">blog at Dr Dobbs</a>. That's partly because I find it intrinsically fascinating, for no very obvious reason; but also because I feel it has huge potential in Artificial Intelligence and cognitive science. I've written about that <a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2006/11/a_categorical_manifesto.html#c018171">in an n-Category Caf&eacute; posting</a>.

Category theory has also inspired me to invent a way of <a href="http://www.j-paine.org/#safe_spreadsheets_fast_with_excelsior">building spreadsheets from modules</a>, and of <a href="http://www.spreadsheet-parts.org/">storing these modules on the Web</a> for anyone to download into their own spreadsheets.
