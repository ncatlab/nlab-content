# Wreaths

## Idea

A **wreath** is a generalisation of a [[distributive law]] between two [[monads]] in a [[2-category]]. While a distributive law in a [[2-category]] $K$ can be seen as an object of $Mnd(Mnd(K))$, a wreath can be seen as an object of $EM(EM(K))$, where $EM$ denotes the completion of a 2-category under [[Eilenbergâ€“Moore objects]]. Since $EM$ is a 2-monad, the multiplication $EM \circ EM \to EM$ produces from every wreath a **composite monad**.
