## Idea

Given a [[space]] $X$ and a [[group]] $G$, a $G$-[[flat connection]] or $G$-[[local system]] is a map $X \to \flat \mathbf{B}G$, or equivalently a map $\Pi(X) \to \mathbf{B}G$. A _moduli space of flat connections_ is a [[moduli space]]/[[moduli stack]] of such structure.

## Examples

The moduli space of flat connections for suitable [[Lie groups]] over [[Riemann surfaces]] appears as the [[phase space]] of $G$-[[Chern-Simons theory]] over these surfaces. It carries itself a [[projectively flat connection]], the _[[Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov connection]]_ or _[[Hitchin connection]]_.

## Properties

The [[Narasimhan–Seshadri theorem]] asserts that the moduli space of [[flat connections]] on a [[Riemann surface]] is naturally a [[complex manifold]].
