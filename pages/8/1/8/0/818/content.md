If you have a specific question that you think that someone here might be able to answer, there are a couple of places to ask:

1. If there is a particular page that it fits in, ask it in a query box on that page and drop a note at [latest changes](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Vanilla/nForum/?CategoryID=5) saying that you've asked a question.

2. Ask it directly on the [n-Forum](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Vanilla/nForum).

In particular, if your question is technical rather than mathematical you should make sure that there is some note on the forum about it since that's the best way to get the attention of a lab elf.
