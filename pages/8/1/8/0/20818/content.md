> The big international conference of \[1974\] in 
London was a turning point \[...\] Ellis' catalog well reflected the state  of theoretical confusion and general disarray in trying to  interpret the $e^+ e^-$ data. But in the midst of all of this was a  talk by [[John Iliopoulos]] (I think I was there too). With  passionate zealotry, he laid out with great accuracy what we call  the [[standard model of particle physics|standard model]]. Everything was there: [[proton decay]], [[charm quark|charm]],  the GIM mechanism of course, [[QCD]], the $SU(2)\times U(1)$ [[electroweak  theory]], $SU(5)$ [[GUT|grand unification]], [[Higgs field|Higgs]], etc. It was all presented with absolute conviction and sounded at the time just a little mad, at least to me (I am a conservative).
