Dolbeault cohomology refers to $H^q(X;\Omega_X^p)$, where $\Omega_X^p$ is the sheaf of holomorphic $p$-forms.

Given any holomorphic vector bundle $E$, one can form the Dolbeault resolution $E \otimes \Omega^{0,q}$, where $\Omega^{0,q}$ is the sheaf of $C^\infty$ $(0,q)$-forms. This is an acyclic resolution of $E$ and hence computes its [[sheaf cohomology]].
