## Definition

The **tessarines** are an [[algebra]] over the [[real numbers]]. Every tessarine $t$ may be represented as
$$
t = a_0 + a_1 i + a_2 j + a_3k
$$
where the basis elements satisfy the following products:

| $\times$ | i | j | k |
|--|--|--|--|
| i | -1 | k | -j |
| j | k | +1 | i |
| k | -j | i | -1 |

and conjugation $t^* = a_0 - a_1 i - a_2 j - a_3k$.

These are closely related to the [[quaternions]], as the generators satisfy similarly-looking relations.

The tessarines are also referred to as **bicomplex numbers** since they may be obtained using the [generalization of the Cayley-Dickson construction](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Cayley-Dickson+construction#cayleydicksonalbert_construction) applied on the [[complex number|complex numbers]].
