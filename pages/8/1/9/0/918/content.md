## Definition

A [[function]] $f$ (of sets) from $A$ to $B$ is __surjective__ if, given any element $y$ of $B$, $y = f(x)$ for some $x$.  A surjective function is also called __onto__ or a __surjection__. 

Surjections are the same as [[epimorphisms]] in [[Set|the category of sets]] and [[effective epimorphism in an (infinity,1)-category|effective epimorphisms]] in [[Set|the (infinity,1)-category of sets]]. 

A _[[bijection]]_ is a function that is both [[surjection|surjective]] and [[injection|injective]].

## The surjection preorder

In [[classical mathematics|classical]] [[set theory]], one writes $|B| \leq^* |A|$ to mean that either there is a surjection $A \to B$ *or* $B=\empty$. The relation $\leq^*$ is a [[preorder]] on the class of all sets, and its restriction to [[inhabited]] sets is the preorder reflection of the category $Surj_{inh}$ of inhabited sets and surjections.

To make this definition less piecemeal and more constructive, one can define $|B| \leq^* |A|$ to mean $B$ is a [[subquotient]] of $A$, in other words one has a surjection $B' \to B$ and an injection $B' \to A$. For $B$ inhabited and a subquotient of $A$, [[excluded middle]] implies there is a surjection from $A$ to $B$, so in [[classical mathematics]] this coincides with the piecemeal definition.

Contrast with the notation $|B| \leq |A|$ if there is an [[injection]] $B\to A$.  Since subobjects are subquotients (e.g. we can take $B'=B$ above), $|B| \leq |A|$ implies $|B| \leq^* |A|$.  (If we wanted to prove this using the piecemeal definition, we would require excluded middle.)

## Axioms of choice

The [[axiom of choice]] states precisely that every surjection in the category of sets has a [[section]]. Thus in this setting one has: $|B| \leq^* |A|$ implies $|B| \leq |A|$, and so $|B| \leq^* |A|$ iff $|B| \leq |A|$ assuming AC. Some authors who doubt the axiom of choice use the term 'onto' for a surjection as defined above and reserve 'surjective' for the stronger notion of a function with a section (a [[split epimorphism]]). 

The axiom [[WISC]] has an equivalent statement (that works in any Boolean [[topos]]) due to Fran&#231;ois Dorais phrased almost entirely in terms of surjections (or epimorphisms): 

>For every set $X$ there is a set $Y$ such that for every surjection $q\colon Z \to X$ there is a function $s\colon Y \to Z$ such that $q\circ s\colon Y\to X$ is a surjection.

One can view this as really a statement about the [[Grothendieck fibration]] over [[Set]] with fibre over $X$ the full subcategory of $Set/X$ on the surjections: every fibre has a [[weakly initial object]].

## In other categories
Since an element $a$ in a set $A$ in the [[category of sets]] is just a [[global element]] $a:1\rightarrow A$, one could define surjections in any category $\mathcal{C}$ with a [[terminal object]] $1$:

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition
A morphism $f:A\rightarrow B$ in a category $\mathcal{C}$ with a [[terminal object]] $1$ is called a __surjection__. a __surjective morphism__, or an __onto morphism__ if, given any global element $y:1\rightarrow B$, there exists a global element $x:1\rightarrow A$ such that $y = f \circ x$.

###### Remark 
Some authors regard surjection as a synonym of [[split epimorphism]], and only use 'onto' for the definition above.

###### Proposition
In a category $\mathcal{C}$ with a [[terminal object]] $1$, the unique morphism $!:A\rightarrow 1$ is a surjection for every object $A$. 
=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
By definition of a terminal object, for every object $A$ there exists a unique morphism $!:A\rightarrow 1$, and the identity morphism is the unique global element $1_{1}:1\rightarrow 1$. The composite of a global element $x:1\rightarrow A$ with the function $!:A\rightarrow 1$ results in a function $! \circ x:1\rightarrow 1$, which by definition of a terminal object is the same as $1_{1}:1\rightarrow 1$. Since $! \circ x = 1_{1}$, for every object $A$, $!:A\rightarrow 1$ is a surjection.

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition
In a category of [[pointed object]]s $\mathcal{C}$, every morphism $f:A\rightarrow B$ is a surjection for every object $A$. 
=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
A pointed object in a category with terminal objects is a object $A$ with a global element $a:1\rightarrow A$ to the object, and morphisms in the category preserve the global element, which means there is only a unique global element for each object $A$. Therefore, for every morphism $f:A\rightarrow B$ and global element $y:1\rightarrow B$, there exists a global element $x:1\rightarrow A$ such that $y = f \circ x$. 
=--

Just because a morphism is a surjection in a concrete category does not mean that the morphism in the underlying category of sets is a surjection; equivalently, the [[forgetful functor]] from any category $\mathcal{C}$ to Set does not preserve surjections. 

### Well-pointedness
The fact that surjections are epimorphisms in [[Set]] is a result of the fact that Set is well-pointed. This could be generalised to any category with a terminal separator $1$. 

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition
In a category $\mathcal{C}$ with a [[terminal object]] $1$ such that $1$ is a [[separator]], every surjection is an [[epimorphism]]. 
=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
For any surjection $f:A\rightarrow B$, suppose there are parallel morphisms $g, h:B\rightarrow C$ such that there $g \circ f = h \circ f$ (a [[fork]]). Then for every global element $y:1\rightarrow B$ there exists a global element $x:1\rightarrow A$ such that $y = f \circ x$, and thus $g \circ y = g \circ f \circ x$ and $h \circ y = h \circ f \circ x$. But since $g \circ f = h \circ f$, $g \circ f \circ x = h \circ f \circ x$, which implies that $g \circ y = h \circ y$. Since $1$ is a [[separator]], then for every global element $y:1\rightarrow B$, if $g \circ y = h \circ y$, then $g = h$. Therefore, every surjection is an epimorphism. 
=--

### Axiom of choice

The axiom of choice for surjections in [[Set]] is the following statement: 

* Every [[surjection]] is a [[split epimorphism]]. 

This axiom could be defined in every category with a terminal object, and could be contrasted with the axiom of choice for epimorphisms, as not every epimorphism is an surjection, nor is every surjection an epimorphism. 

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition
In a category $\mathcal{C}$ with a [[terminal object]] $1$ and binary [[equalisers]] such that every [[surjection]] is a [[split epimorphism]], the terminal object $1$ is a [[separator]]. 
=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
Suppose there are parallel morphisms $g, h:B\rightarrow C$ such that for every global element $y:1\rightarrow B$, $g \circ y = h \circ y$. One could construct an equaliser $f:eq(g,h)\rightarrow B$, which implies that $g \circ f = h \circ f$ and that for any global element $x:1\rightarrow eq(g,h)$, $g \circ f \circ x = h \circ f \circ x$. This implies that for every global element $y:1\rightarrow B$, there exists a global element $x:1\rightarrow eq(g,h)$ where $y = f \circ x$, and the equaliser $f:eq(g,h)\rightarrow B$ is a surjection. Since every surjection is a [[split epimorphism]], $f$ has a section $i:B\rightarrow eq(g,h)$ such that $f \circ i = 1_{B}$, the identity morphism on $B$, $g \circ f \circ i = h \circ f \circ i$, $g \circ 1_{B} = h \circ 1_{B}$, and $g = f$. Because for every global element $y:1\rightarrow B$, $g \circ y = h \circ y$ implies $g = h$, the terminal object $1$ is a [[separator]].
