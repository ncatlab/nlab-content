#Big picture

Legendre transformation is an certain operation on convex functions from real normed spaces to the real line; it is one of the cornerstones of convex analysis. The space of arguments changes accordingly. The main application is in differentiable setup in [[classical physics]] and [[symplectic geometry]]. In [[classical mechanics]] the Hamiltonian function $H$ is a Legendre transform of the [[Lagrangean]] $L$ and viceversa; in many dimensions, hybrid versions are possible. When the physics of the system is given by the variational principle, then the Legendre transform of an extremal quantity is a conserved quantity. In equilibrium [[thermodynamics]] we usually consider conditions in which some standard quantities are set to be fixed (some candidates: entropy, temperature, pressure, volume, magnetization), the choice of fixed quantities dictates the choice of variables for the description of the system and quantity which is extremized as well as which one takes the role of conserved energy. Some of the standard choices are enthalpy $H$, Helmholtz free energy $F$, internal energy $U$ etc.

> for the moment this entry just serves the purpose to collect the following reference on the notion of Legendre transformation in the context of [[Lie algebroid]]s.

See also [wikipedia:Legendre transformation](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/edit/Legendre+transformation) and [wikipedia:Legendre-Fenchel transformation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre-Fenchel_transformation); the two wikipedia articles have much detail in certain specific approaches and cases, but also miss some of the basic ones to be balanced.
