## Idea 

Peano arithmetic refers to a [[theory]] which formalizes [[arithmetic]] operations on the [[natural numbers]] $\mathbb{N}$ and their properties. There is a [[first-order theory|first-order]] Peano arithmetic and a [[second-order logic|second-order]] Peano arithmetic, and one may speak of Peano arithmetic in higher-order type theory. 

As first-order logic has certain [[syntax|syntactic]] and [[model theory|model-theoretic]] advantages over second-order logic, and has been much further developed, the default notion of Peano arithmetic is usually taken to be the first-order one. However, we will describe both the first- and second-order notions. Note that Peano's original treatment was second-order.

## Second-order Peano arithmetic 

Against a fixed background of "[[sets]]" (which we consider [[category theory|categorically]], e.g., a model of [[ETCS]], or even just any [[topos]]), Peano arithmetic is formalized by stipulating a set $N$ with an element $0: 1 \to N$ and an unary [[function]] $s: N \to N$, subject to the following [[axioms]]: 

* $\forall_x \neg s(x) = 0$; 

* $\forall_{x, y} s(x) = s(y) \Rightarrow x = y$; 

* (Second-order [[induction]]) $\forall_{I \subseteq N} [0 \in I \wedge (\forall_x x \in I \Rightarrow s(x) \in I] \Rightarrow I = N$. 

Regarding $N$ as an [[algebra of an endofunctor]] $F(X) = 1 + X$, the first two axioms say that the structure map $(0, s): 1 + N \to N$ is [[monomorphism|monic]], and the [[induction]] axiom says that the only $F$-subalgebra of $N$ is $N$ itself. (In particular, $(0, s): F N \to N$ is tautologically an $F$-[[algebra of an endofunctor|algebra]] map where $F N$ is given the $F$-algebra structure $F(0, s): F F N \to F N$. Being [[monomorphism|monic]], the subalgebra $(0, s): F N \to N$ is an [[isomorphism]], by induction.) 

It may be shown that these properties determine $N$ up to isomorphism (one says second-order Peano arithmetic is 'categorical', but this is not at all related to the notion of [[category]]), and moreover:

###### Proposition 
In a [[topos]], an object which satisfies the Peano axioms is a [[natural numbers object]] (and natural numbers objects satisfy the Peano axioms).

This is a special case of a much more general result which is part of the general theory of [[recursion]] and [[well-founded coalgebras]]:

###### Theorem 
If $\mathbf{E}$ is a topos and $F: \mathbf{E} \to \mathbf{E}$ is a [[taut functor]], then any $F$-[[algebra of an endofunctor|algebra]] $X$ whose structure map $\xi: F X \to X$ is [[monomorphism|monic]] and for which the only $F$-subalgebra of $X$ is $X$ itself is an [[initial object|initial]] $F$-algebra.

## First-order Peano arithmetic 

Here we cannot [[quantifier|quantify]] over [[subsets]], as in the second-order induction scheme, and the initial algebra techniques that can be used to manufacture addition and multiplication do not apply. Instead, addition and multiplication need to be built into the [[signature]]. Induction becomes an induction scheme over formulas in the language generated by the signature. 

Thus, the signature of first-order Peano arithmetic consists of a constant $0$, an unary function symbol $s$, and binary function symbols $+, \cdot$. The Peano axioms are 

1. $\forall_x \neg s(x) = 0$; 

1. $\forall_{x, y} s(x) = s(y) \Rightarrow x = y$; 

1. $\forall_x \left( x = 0 \vee \exists_y x = s(y) \right)$; 

1. $\forall_x x + 0 = x$, 

1. $\forall_{x, y} x + s(y) = s(x+y)$; 

1. $\forall_x x \cdot 0 = 0$; 

1. $\forall_{x, y} x \cdot s(y) = x \cdot y + x$; 

1. (Induction scheme) For all formulas $\phi(x, y_1, \ldots, y_k) = \phi(x; \vec{y})$ with $k+1$ free variables, 
$$\forall_{y_1, \ldots, y_k} [\phi(0, \vec{y}) \wedge \forall_x (\phi(x; \vec{y}) \Rightarrow \phi(s(x); \vec{y})] \Rightarrow \forall_z \phi(z, \vec{y}).$$

The third axiom is actually redundant, being an instance of the induction scheme (take $\phi(x) = [x = 0 \vee \exists_y x = s(y)]$). We include it because it is needed for weaker systems of arithmetic in which the induction schema is curtailed or dropped, notably [[Robinson arithmetic]]. 

By the [[Lowenheim-Skolem theorem]], there are [[nonstandard model of arithmetic|"nonstandard" models]] of any infinite cardinality of Peano arithmetic, all of them [[elementary embedding|elementarily embedding]] the standard model of arithmetic.
