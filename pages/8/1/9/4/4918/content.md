Martin Hyland is Professor in Mathematical Logic in the University of Cambridge, and is a Fellow of King's College, Cambridge. Hyland is  known for work on the effective topos (within topos theory), on the lambda-calculus and on game semantics. 

His  main research interests are in the following.

*  Mathematical Logic: Lambda Calculus, Recursion Theory, Realizability, Proof Theory, Linear Logic.

*  Category Theory: Topos Theory, Categorical algebra, Operads, Higher-dimensional Categories.

*  Theoretical Computer Science: Applications of Category Theory, Domain Theory, Polymorphism, Game Semantics.
