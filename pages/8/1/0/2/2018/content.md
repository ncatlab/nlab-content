A __noetherian ring__ is a ring for which every ascending chain of its ideals stabilizes. 

A dual condition is artinian: an artinian ring is the ring satisfying the descending chain condition on ideals. The symmetry is broken if one considers unital rings: every unital artinian ring is noetherian.
