A (left) __noetherian ring__ $R$ is a [[ring]] for which every ascending chain of its (left) [[ideal]]s stabilizes. In other words, it is noetherian if its underlying $R$-module ${}_R R$ is a noetherian object in the category $R Mod$ of left $R$-modules (recall that a left ideal is simply a submodule of ${}_R R$). Similarly for right noetherian rings. Left noetherianness is independent of right noetherianness. 

A dual condition is artinian: an __artinian ring__ is a ring satisfying the descending chain condition on ideals. The symmetry is broken if one considers unital rings: every unital artinian ring is noetherian.
