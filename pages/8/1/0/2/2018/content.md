A (left) __noetherian ring__ $R$ is a [[ring]] for which every ascending chain of its (left) [[ideal]]s stabilizes. In other words, it is noetherian if its underlying $R$-module ${}_R R$ is a noetherian object in the category $R Mod$ of left $R$-modules (recall that a left ideal is simply a submodule of ${}_R R$). Similarly for right noetherian rings. Left noetherianness is independent of right noetherianness. 
A ring is noetherian if it is both left noetherian and right noetherian. 

A dual condition is artinian: an __[[artinian ring]]__ is a ring satisfying the descending chain condition on ideals. The symmetry is severely broken if one considers unital rings: for example every unital artinian ring is noetherian; artinian rings are intuitively much smaller than generic noetherian rings.

Spectra of noetherian rings are glued together to define [[noetherian scheme|locally noetherian schemes]].
