## Idea

A relation in which either it or its negation is true. 

## Definition

A decidable [[binary relation]] $R$ on a set $S$ is a relation such that for all elements $a \in S$ and $b \in S$, $R(a, b)$ or $\neg R(a, b)$. 

## Examples

* Every set with [[decidable equality]] has a decidable equality relation. 

* In the presence of [[excluded middle]], every relation is a decidable relation.
