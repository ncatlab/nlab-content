## Idea

Given a (Riemannian) [[foliation]] $F$ on a manifold $X$, the _holonomy groupoid_ of $F$ has as objects the points of $X$. Given points $x,y$ on the same leaf, a morphism between them is the equivalence class of a path in the leaf from $x$ to $y$, where two paths are identified if they induce the same [[germ]] of a holonomy transformation on a small transversal subspace between their endpoints. If $x$ any $y$ are not on the same leaf, then there is no morphism between them.

This is naturally a [[topological groupoid]] and a [[Lie groupoid]] if done right.

The **monodromy groupoid** of the foliation is obtained from this by furhtermore dividing out [[homotopy]] between paths in a leaf.
