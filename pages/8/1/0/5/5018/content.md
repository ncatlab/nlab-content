## Idea

A _holonomy groupoid_ is a [[groupoid]] naturally associated with a [[foliation]]. 

Given a (Riemannian) [[foliation]] $F$ on a manifold $X$, the _holonomy groupoid_ of $F$ has as objects the points of $X$. Given points $x,y$ on the same leaf, a morphism between them is the equivalence class of a path in the leaf from $x$ to $y$, where two paths are identified if they induce the same [[germ]] of a holonomy transformation on a small transversal subspace between their endpoints. If $x$ any $y$ are not on the same leaf, then there is no morphism between them.

This is naturally a [[topological groupoid]] and a [[Lie groupoid]] if done right.

The **monodromy groupoid** of the foliation is obtained from this by furhthermore dividing out [[homotopy]] between paths in a leaf.



## Definition

### Foliation holonomy

Let $(X,\mathcal{F})$ be a foliated manifold with $q = codim(\mathcal{F})$. Let $L$ be a leaf of $\mathcal{F}$, let $x,y \in L$ be two points, and $T$ a transverse section through $x$, $S$ a transverse section through $y$ (submanifolds transversal to the leaves of $\mathcal{F}$). 

To a path $\gamma : [0,1] \to L$ from $x$ to $y$ associate the [[germ]] of a [[diffeomorphism]]

$$
  hol(\gamma) = hol^{S,T}(\gamma) : (T,x) \to (S,y)
$$

called the **holonomy** of the path $\gamma$ with respect to $S$ and $T$, as follows.

If there exists a foliation chart $U$ of $\mathcal{F}$ that contains the whole path, then there exists an open [[neighbourhood]] $A$ of $x$ in $T$ inside $U$ on which there is a smooth map $f : A \to S$ satisfying

1. $f(x) = y$;

1. for every $x' \in A$ the point $f(X')$ lies on the same plaque in $U$ as $x'$. We can choose $A$ small so that this is a [[diffeomorphism]] onto its image. Define then $hol^{S,T}(\gamma)$ to be the [[germ]] of this diffoemorphism

$$
  hol^{S,T}(\gamma) = germ_x(f)
  \,.
$$

Generally, if the path does not sit in a single $U$ there is a decompoasition of $\gamma$ into pieces $\{\gamma_i\}$ and a sequence $U_1, U_2, \cdots, U_n$ of foliation charts such $\gamma_i$ sits in $U_i$. Choose transversal sections $T_i$ in the double overlaps and define then

$$
  hol^{S,T}(\gamma) 
   =
   hol^{T,T_{i-1}}(\gamma1_{i-1})
    \circ
   \cdots
   \circ
   hol^{T_1,T_2}(\gamma1_2)
    \circ 
   hol^{S,T_1}(\gamma1_1)
  \,.
$$ 

This definition is idenpendent of the choices of the $U_i$ and only depends on $T$ and $S$.

**Proposition**

* Two homotopic paths with the same endpoints induce the same holonomy.

* If $S, S'$ are two transversal sections through $x$ and $T,T'$ two transversal sections through $y$, then 

  $$
    hol^{S',T'}(\gamma)
    = 
    hol(\gamma)^{T,T'}(const_y)\circ hol^{S,T}(\gamma) \circ hol^{S,S'}(const_x)
   \,.
  $$


### Holonomy groupoid

Given a foliated manifold $(\mathcal{F},X)$, the **monodromy groupoid** is the [[disjoint union]] of the [[fundamental groupoids]] of the leaves of $\mathcal{F}$ the groupoid whose objects are the points of $X$, which has no morphisms between points on different leaves and for which the morphisms between points on the same leaf are [[homotopy]]-classes relative endpoints between paths in the leaf.

The **holonomy groupoid** is defined analogously, where instead of identifying two paths if they are homotopic, they are identified if they induce the same holonomy transformation, in the above sense.
