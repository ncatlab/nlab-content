## Idea
 {#Idea}

The notion of "*extension system*" ([Marmolejo & Wood (2010)](#MarmolejoWood10)), originally called "*[[algebraic theory]] in extension form*" ([Manes (1976), p. 32](#Manes76)) and previously also referred to as "*[[Kleisli triple]]*" ([Moggi (1991), Def. 1.2](#Moggi91)) is an equivalent way of presenting the [[mathematical structure|structure]] of a *[[monad]]* (on a [[category]]) that does not explicitly refer to [[composition]] ("iteration") of its [[underlying]] [[endofunctor]]. This is simpler for certain purposes, and in any case more natural for others, notably in the use of [[monads in computer science]]. Abstractly, the notion may be understood as specialising the definition of $J$-[[relative monads]] to the case where $J$ is the [[identity functor]]

Specifically, noticing that the [[endofunctor]] [[underlying]] a [[monad]] may be understood as constructing its [free algebras](algebra+over+a+monad#FreeAlgebras), which (lacking [[relations]]) tend to be "large" (say as concerns the [[cardinality]] of their [[underlying sets]]), the iterated application of this endofunctor produces ever larger objects, and some authors have pointed to avoiding this phenomenon as motivation for considering extension systems:

> {#MarmolejoWoodQuote} &lbrack;[Marmolejo-Wood 10](#MarmolejoWood10)&rbrack;: there is an important overarching reason to consider monads in this way. Extension systems allow us to completely dispense with the iterates $[$...$]$ of the underlying arrow. No iteration is necessary. A moment's reflection on the various terms of terms and terms of terms of terms that occur in practical applications suggest that this alone justifies the alternate approach. $[$...$]$ we note that extension systems in [[higher category theory|higher dimensional category theory]] provide an even more important simplication of monads. For even in dimension 2, some of the tamest examples are built on [[pseudofunctors]] that are difficult to iterate.

Major alternative motivation for extension systems comes from their understanding as [[monads in computer science]] ([[Kleisli triples]]); see there for more.

## Definition

An **extension system** ([Marmolejo-Wood 2010](#MarmolejoWood10)) on a [[category]] $C$ consists of

* For every [[object]] $A\in C$, an object $T A\in C$ and a [[morphism]] $\eta_A \colon A\to T A$, and

* For every [[morphism]] $f\colon B\to T A$ in $C$, a morphism $f^T \colon T B \to T A$ (the *Kleisli extension* of $f$), satisfying the following [[axioms]]:

  * For every $A$ we have $(\eta_A)^T = 1_{T A}$,

  * For every $f \colon B\to T A$, we have $f^T \circ \eta_B = f$, and

  * For every $f \colon B\to T A$ and $g:C \to T B$, we have $f^T \circ g^T = (f^T \circ g)^T$.

Given these data, we make $T$ a [[functor]] by $T f = (\eta_A \circ f)^T$, we define multiplication maps $\mu_A:T T A \to T A$ as $(1_{T A})^T$, and we verify that the result is a [[monad]].  Conversely, given a monad $(T,\eta,\mu)$, we define $f^T = \mu_A \circ T f$ and check the above axioms.  Thus, extension systems are [[equivalence|equivalent]] to monads.

### The Kleisli category

This presentation of a monad is especially convenient for defining the [[Kleisli category]] $C_T$ (whence the aternative terminology "[[Kleisli triple]]"): 

its objects are those of $C$, its morphisms $B\to A$ are the morphisms $B\to T A$ in $C$, and the composite of $f:B\to T A$ with $g:C \to T B$ is $f^T \circ g$.

### The category of algebras

It is also possible to define [[algebras over a monad]] using this presentation.  A $T$-algebra consists of

* An object $B$, and

* For every morphism $h:X\to B$, a morphism $h^B : T X \to B$, such that

* For every $h:X\to B$ we have $h^B \circ \eta_X = h$, and

* For every $h:X\to B$ and $y:Y\to T X$ we have $h^B \circ y^T = (h^B \circ y)^B$.

### As endofunctors with a particular isomorphism

The data of a monad on a category $C$ can be equivalently presented by specifying:

* An endofunctor $T : C \to C$, and

* A natural isomorphism $\phi : \Hom_C(-,T-) \cong \Hom_C(T-,T-)$. That is, for all objects $X$ and $Y$ of $C$, a bijection $\phi_{X,Y} : \Hom_C(X,TY) \cong \Hom_C(TX, TY)$ which is natural in $X$ and $Y$.

The monad structure can be obtained as follows. For each object $X$ of $C$, we have a function $\phi_{TX,X} : \Hom_C(TX,TX) \to \Hom_C(TTX, TX)$ and a function $\phi_{X,X}^{-1} : \Hom_C(TX, TX) \to \Hom_C(X,TX)$. Let $\mu_X$ and $\eta_X$ be the image of $\mathrm{Id}_{TX}$ under $\phi_{TX,X}$ and $\phi_{X,X}^{-1}$ respectively. The resulting natural transformations $\eta$ and $\mu$ make $(T,\eta,\mu)$ a monad.

Conversely, given a monad $(T,\eta,\mu)$, define the map $\phi$ as follows. For all objects $X$ and $Y$ of $C$, define $\phi_{X,Y} : \Hom_C(X,TY) \to \Hom_C(TX,TY)$ by setting $\phi_{X,Y}(f) = \mu_Y \circ Tf$ for all $f : X \to TY$, and define $\phi_{X,Y}^{-1}$ by setting $\phi_{X,Y}^{-1}(g) = g \circ \eta_X$ for all $g: TX \to TY$. The axioms of a monad make $\phi$ a natural isomorphism with inverse $\phi^{-1}$.

### Strong monads

When $C$ is a [[cartesian closed category]], to make $T$ a [[strong monad]] we simply have to enhance the extension operation $(-)^T$ to an internal morphism $(T A)^B \to (T A)^{T B}$, or equivalently $T B \times (T A)^B \to T A$.  This morphism is known as "bind" in use of [[monads in computer science]].

The use of extension systems (there called [[Kleisli triples]]) as [[monads in computer science]] capturing [[computation]] with side effects is due to:
