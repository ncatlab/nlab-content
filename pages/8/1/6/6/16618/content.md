## Idea
 {#Idea}

An *extension system* (also: "Kleisli triple system") is a way of presenting the [[mathematical structure|structure]] of a [[monad]] that does not involve [[composition]] ("iteration") of its [[underlying]] [[endofunctor]]. This is simpler for certain purposes, and in any case more natural for others, notably in the use of [[monads in computer science]]. Abstractly, the definition arises by specialising the definition of $J$-[[relative monad]] to take $J$ to be the identity functor.

Specifically, noticing that the [[endofunctor]] [[underlying]] a [[monad]] may be understood as constructing its [[free construction|free]] algebras, which (lacking [[relations]]) may be "large" (say as concerns the [[cardinality]] of their [[underlying sets]]), the iterated application of this endofunctor will produces even larger objects, and some authors have pointed to avoiding this phenomenon as motivation for considering extension systems:

> {#MarmolejoWoodQuote} &lbrack;[Marmolejo-Wood 10](#MarmolejoWood10)&rbrack;: there is an important overarching reason to consider monads in this way. Extension systems allow us to completely dispense with the iterates $[$...$]$ of the underlying arrow. No iteration is necessary. A moment's reflection on the various terms of terms and terms of terms of terms that occur in practical applications suggest that this alone justifies the alternate approach. $[$...$]$ we note that extension systems in [[higher category theory|higher dimensional category theory]] provide an even more important simplication of monads. For even in dimension 2, some of the tamest examples are built on [[pseudofunctors]] that are difficult to iterate.



## Definition

An **extension system** ([Marmolejo-Wood 2010](#MarmolejoWood10)) on a [[category]] $C$ consists of

* For every [[object]] $A\in C$, an object $T A\in C$ and a [[morphism]] $\eta_A \colon A\to T A$, and

* For every [[morphism]] $f\colon B\to T A$ in $C$, a morphism $f^T \colon T B \to T A$, satisfying the following [[axioms]]:

  * For every $A$ we have $(\eta_A)^T = 1_{T A}$,

  * For every $f \colon B\to T A$, we have $f^T \circ \eta_B = f$, and

  * For every $f \colon B\to T A$ and $g:C \to T B$, we have $f^T \circ g^T = (f^T \circ g)^T$.

Given these data, we make $T$ a [[functor]] by $T f = (\eta_A \circ f)^T$, we define multiplication maps $\mu_A:T T A \to T A$ as $(1_{T A})^T$, and we verify that the result is a [[monad]].  Conversely, given a monad $(T,\eta,\mu)$, we define $f^T = \mu_A \circ T f$ and check the above axioms.  Thus, extension systems are [[equivalence|equivalent]] to monads.

### The Kleisli category

This presentation of a monad is especially convenient for defining the [[Kleisli category]] $C_T$: its objects are those of $C$, its morphisms $B\to A$ are the morphisms $B\to T A$ in $C$, and the composite of $f:B\to T A$ with $g:C \to T B$ is $f^T \circ g$.

### The category of algebras

It is also possible to define [[algebras over a monad]] using this presentation.  A $T$-algebra consists of

* An object $B$, and

* For every morphism $h:X\to B$, a morphism $h^B : T X \to B$, such that

* For every $h:X\to B$ we have $h^B \circ \eta_X = h$, and

* For every $h:X\to B$ and $y:Y\to T X$ we have $h^B \circ y^T = (h^B \circ y)^B$.

### Strong monads

When $C$ is a [[cartesian closed category]], to make $T$ a [[strong monad]] we simply have to enhance the extension operation $(-)^T$ to an internal morphism $(T A)^B \to (T A)^{T B}$, or equivalently $T B \times (T A)^B \to T A$.  This morphism is known as "bind" in use of [[monads in computer science]].

The use of extension systems (there called [[Kleisli triples]]) as [[monads in computer science]] capturing [[computation]] with side effects is due to:
