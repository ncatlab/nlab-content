## Idea

An [[initial object in an (∞,1)-category|initial object]] in an [[(∞,1)-category]] of [[∞-algebras over an (∞,1)-monad]] which is [[generators and relations|presentable]].

These are thought to be the [[categorical semantics]] of [[higher inductive types]].

On [[truncated object of an (∞,1)-category|0-truncated]] objects the notion restricts to that of an [[initial algebra of an endofunctor]].
