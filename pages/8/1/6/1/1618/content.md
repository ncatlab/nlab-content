#Definition#

A **point $x$ of a [[topos]] $E$** is a [[geometric morphism]]
$$
  x : Set \to E
  \,.
$$

That is, it\'s a [[global element]] of the topos.

Note that $Set = Sh(*)$ is the topos of [[sheaf|sheaves]] on a one-[[point]] [[topological space|space]].  Therefore, if $E$ is the topos $Sh(X)$ of sheaves on a [[sober space]] $X$, then a point of $E$ in this sense is equivalent to a point of $X$ in the usual sense.

On the other hand, if $E$ is the [[classifying topos]] of a [[geometric theory]] $T$, then a point of $E$ is the same as a model of $T$ in $Set$.
