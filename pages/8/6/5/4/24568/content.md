## Definition

An object $A$ in a category $C$ is a __locally small object__ if the slice category $C/A$ is essentially small (has a small skeleton). In other words, isomorphism classes of monomorphisms with target $A$ (=[[subobject]]s of $A$) form a set.

An object $B$ in a category $C$ is __colocally small__ if it is locally small in the dual category. In other words, (isomorphism classes of) quotient objects form a set.

A category if [[well-powered category|well-powered]] if its every object is locally small. In older literature and in the subject of abelian categories one sometimes says locally small category for a well-powered category, clashing with the weaker standard notion of a [[locally small category]] (all Hom-classes are sets).
