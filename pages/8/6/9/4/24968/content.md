## Idea

Monism is a philosophical position which states that there is only one valid approach to a particular field. This contrasts with [[pluralism]], which states that there are multiple equally valid approaches to a particular field. 

## Monism in the foundations of mathematics

In the context of the [[foundations of mathematics]], monism states that there is only a one valid approach to the foundations of mathematics. Traditionally, the mathematical status quo regarded the [[material set theory]] of [[ZFC]] as the one valid approach to the foundations of mathematcs. Some category theorists take the [[categorical set theory]] of [[ETCS]] as the one valid approach to the foundations of mathematics, while some type theorists take [[Martin-Löf type theory]] or [[cubical type theory]] to be the one valid approach to the foundations of mathematics.
