on [[topos theory]].

Peter Johnstone's classic text on [[topos theory]] from 1977 served as the standard reference in the field until the publication of MacLane-Moerdijk's *[[Sheaves in Geometry and Logic]]* in 1992 and the monumental first two volumes of *[[Sketches of an elephant]]* in 2002, also by Johnstone. _Topos Theory_ reportedly contains almost all results in topos theory known in the mid 1970s.

(Johnstone also wrote *[[Stone Spaces]]*.)

Although the author takes no prisoners the text is not really as unreadable as the introduction to the [[Elephant]] boasts but contains in a concise form what still constitutes the core of the subject.

It has also several unique features in comparison with its successor volumes in that it offers (somewhat more opiniated) remarks on the _historical development of topos theory_ and an emphasis of the intuitionistic algebra and theory of spectrum prominent in the early 1970s, a chapter on _cohomology theory_ and due to the recent paperback reprint an affordable price.
