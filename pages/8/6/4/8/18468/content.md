## Idea


The formulation of [[quantum field theory]] has many aspects and perspectives. Two prominent threads are the following:

**1) [[perturbation theory]] by means of [[formal geometry|formal]] [[Feynman diagram]] expansions of ([[Wick rotation|Wick rotated]]) [[path integrals]]**

   This is the approach predominant in [[phenomenology]]. 

   It produces the [[observable]] [[numbers]] which are checked to great precision in [[experiments]] starting from the early development of [[quantum electrodynamics]], fully established with the success of [[quantum chromodynamics]] and recently culminating in the [[Higgs field]] physics seen at the [[LHC]] experiment, confirming the [[standard model of particle physics]].

   While many of the mathematical intricacies of this approach have found solutions over the decades, most of these rely on global properties of [[Minkowski spacetime]] such as translation invariance and existence of an invariant [[vacuum]] [[quantum state]], hence on a consistent concept of [[particles]], none of which generalizes robustly to [[quantum field theory on curved spacetimes]] of relevance in [[cosmology]], [[black hole radiation]] or the [[instanton in QCD|instanton vacuum of QCD]].


**2) [[algebraic quantum field theory]] by means of [[local nets]] of [[C*-algebras]] of [[observables]]**

   This is the approach predominant in [[mathematical physics]]. 

   It produces the structural [[theorems]] of quantum field theory, such as the [[PCT theorem]] and the [[spin-statistics theorem]] and it seamlessly generalizes to [[QFT on curved spacetimes]].

   In its insistence on [[C*-algebras]] its ambition is to describe the full [[non-perturbative quantum field theory|non-perturbative]] quantum field theory. But as a matter of fact not a single relevant example ([[interaction|interacting]] QFT in spacetime dimensions 4 or greater) is known. Indeed, the construction of the motivating example, [[quantization of Yang-Mills theory]], is one of the open "millenium problems".

$\,$

But more recently a synthesis of these two threads has been developed:

**3) [[locally covariant perturbative quantum field theory]] by means of [[local nets]] of [[formal power series]] [[algebras of observables]]**

This rests on the observation ([Il'in-Slavnov 78](#IlinSlavnov78), [Brunetti-Fredenhagen 00](#BrunettiFredenhagen00)) that the formulation of [[renormalization]] by [Epstein-Glaser 73](#EpsteinGlaser73) naturally produces a [[local net]] of [[formal power series]] [[algebras of observables]]. Applied to [[gauge theory]] such as [[quantum electrodynamics]] this is known as _[[causal perturbation theory]]_ ([Scharf 95](#Scharf95)).

This formulation hence allows to construct the usual examples of [[perturbative quantum field theories]] in a rigorous fashion, and extend them to [[quantum field theory on curved spacetimes]], such as in formulation of perturbative [[quantum gravity]] ([Brunetti-Fredenhagen-Rejzner 13](#BrunettiFredenhagenRejzner13)).

$\,$

There remains however one problem: When applied to [[gauge theory]] on [[quantum field theory on curved spacetime|on curved spacetime]] the usual axioms on a [[local net]] break: either they enforce all [[characteristic classes]] of the [[gauge field]] ("[[instanton sectors]]") to be trivial, or else the axioms encoding locality are broken. This remaining issue is lifted by passing from plain [[algebras of observables]] to [[homotopical algebra|homotopical algebras]] ([[higher algebra|higher algebras]]), and hence to a formulation of [[homotopical algebraic quantum field theory]]. This is still in the making.
