A __point__ of a [[locale]] $X$ is a [[continuous map]] (in the sense of locales) to $X$ from the abstract [[point]] (seen as a locale whose corresponding [[frame]] is the frame of [[truth values]]).

If $X^*$ is the [[frame]] that corresponds to $X$, then a point of $X$ is the same as a frame [[homomorphism]] from $X^*$ to the frame of truth values.  This is the same as a [[completely prime filter]] in $X^*$.

A point of $X$ is the same as a point (in the usual sense) of the [[topological space]] $pt(X)$; that is, the [[underlying set]] of $pt(X)$ is the set of points (in the sense above) of $X$.  (Thus, we call $pt(X)$ the _space of points_ of $X$.)  Conversely, if $S$ is a [[topological space]], then every point of $S$ determines a point of the locale $op(S)$ of opens of $S$.  This map $S \to pt(op(S))$ (which is a [[continuous map]] of topological spaces) is [[injection|injective]] iff $S$ is $T_0$ (see [[separation axioms]]); it is a [[homeomorphism]] iff $S$ is [[sober space|sober]].
