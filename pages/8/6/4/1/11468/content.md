## Idea

What is called _$p$-adic string theory_ is the study of a variant of [[scattering amplitudes]] in [[string theory]] where the [[worldsheet]] of the [[string]] is regarded not as a [[Riemann surface]] but as an object in [[p-adic geometry]].

### Open string amplitudes

The original observation is that of ([Volovich 87](#Volovich87), reviewed in [VVZ 95, section XIV](#VVZ95)) that the [[integral]] expression for the [[Veneziano amplitude]] of the [[open string|open]] [[bosonic string]] naturally generalizes from an integral over the [[real numbers]] (which in this case parameterize the [[boundary]] of the [[open string]] [[worldsheet]]) to the [[p-adic numbers]]. 

The main result here is ([Freund-Witten 87](#FreundWitten87)) that the ordinary [[Veneziano amplitude]] equals the inverse of the product of its $p$-adic versions, for all primes $p$. With due regularization this result carries over to other [[string scattering amplitudes]], too. When forming these products one also speaks of _[[ring of adeles|adelic]] string theory_.

Since the [[Veneziano amplitude]] concerns the [[bosonic string]] [[tachyon]] [[state]], [[p-adic string theory]] has been discussed a lot in the context of [[tachyon condensation]] and [[Sen's conjecture]] ([Cottrell 02](#Cottrell02)).

Traditionally literature on $p$-adic string theory asserts that the generalization of this from the [[open string]] to the [[closed string]] remains unclear, since it is unclear which adic version of the [[complex numbers]] to use. However, in other parts of the literature adic versions of closed strings are common, this we discuss [below](#TopologicalWittenGenus).

### Closed string 1-loop vacuum amplitudes (topological Witten genus)
 {#TopologicalWittenGenus}

Generally, the development of string theory has shown that its [[worldsheet]] is usefully regarded as an object in [[algebraic geometry]] (see also at _[[number theory and physics]]_) and mathematically the generalization from [[algebraic varieties]] over the [[complex numbers]] to more general algebraic varieties (or [[schemes]]) is often natural, if not compelling. 

For instance when the [[Witten genus]] (essentially the [[partition function]] of the [[superstring]]) is refined to the [[string orientation of tmf]] then the [[elliptic curves]] over the [[complex numbers]] which serve as the [[torus|toroidal]] [[worldsheets]] over the [[complex numbers]] are generalized to [[elliptic curves]] over general [[rings]] and by the [[fracture theorems]] the computations in [[tmf]] in fact typically proceed (see [here](tmf#DecomopositionViaArithmeticSquares)) by decomposing the general problem into that of ellitpic curves over the [[rational numbers]] and over the [[p-adic integers]]. The result refines the [[Witten genus]]

$$
  \Omega^String_{\bullet} \longrightarrow MF_\bullet
$$

(being a [[ring]] [[homomorphism]]) from the [[String structure]] [[cobordism ring]] to that of [[modular forms]] to one of [[E-âˆž rings]]

$$
  M String \longrightarrow tmf
$$

from the [[String structure]] [[Thom spectrum]] to [[tmf]]. Notice that $M String$ here classifies String-[[cobordism cohomology theory|cobordism]] and hence parameterizes ordinary (not $p$-adic) [[target space|target]] [[spacetime]] [[manifolds]], while $tmf$ on the right does regard the [[genus of a surface|genus]]-1 [[worldsheet]] as a general [[elliptic curve]], hence in particular possibly as an [elliptic curve over the p-adic integers](elliptic%20curve#OverpAdics).

## Related concepts

* The interesting aspects of $p$-adic string theory have led people to consider _[[p-adic physics]]_ more generally. But it remains noteworthy that in $p$-adic string theory it is exactly only the [[worldsheet]] which is regarded in [[p-adic geometry]], while for instance the [[complex numbers]] as they appear as [[coefficients]] of [[quantum physics]] are not replaced by $p$-adics.
