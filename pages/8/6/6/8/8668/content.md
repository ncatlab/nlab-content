## General idea

The general idea is that a _[[locally presentable category]]_ is a [[large category]] [[generators and relations|generated from]] small data: from [[small objects]] under [[small colimit]]. 

### Generation from generators

The notion of _[[locally presentable category]]_ is, at least roughly, an analogue for [[categories]] of the notion of a [[finitely generated module]].

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

An [[abelian group]] $A$ is called _[[finitely generated module|finitely generated]]_ if there is a [[finite set|finite]] [[subset]]

$$
  \iota \colon S \hookrightarrow U(A)
$$ 

of the underlying set $U(A)$ of $A$, such that every element of $A$ is a sum of such generating elements. 

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

We always have the maximal such presentation where $S = U(A)$ is the whole underlying set and $\iota \colon F(U(A)) \to A$ is the [[counit of an adjunction|counit]] of the [[free-forgetful adjunction]]. But the presentation is all the more interesting/useful the _smaller_ $S$ is. 

=--

Now, the [[categorification]] of "commutative sum" is _[[colimit]]_. Hence let now $\mathcal{C}$ be a category with all [[small colimits]].

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

We say a subclass $S \hookrightarow Obj(\mathcal{C})$ of [[objects]] or equivalently the [[full subcategory]] $\mathcal{C}^0 \hookrightarrow \mathcal{C}$ on this subclass _generates_ $\mathcal{C}$ if every object in $\mathcal{C}$ is a [[colimit]] of objects in $\mathcal{C}^0$, hence the colimit over a [[diagram]] of the form

$$
  D \to \mathcal{C}^0 \hookrightarrow \mathcal{C}
  \,.
$$

=--

As before, such a presentation is all the more useful the "smaller" the generating data is. In order to grasp the various aspects of the notion of "smallness" in [[category theory]] we need the notion of [[regular cardinal]].

### Small data

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

The [[cardinality]] $\kappa = {\vert S\vert}$ of a [[set]] $S$ is _[[regular cardinal|regular]]_ if every [[coproduct]]/[[disjoint union]] of sets of cardianlity smaller than $\kappa$ and indexed by a set of cardinality smaller than $\kappa$ is itself of cardinality smaller than $\kappa$.

=--

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

The smallest [[regular cardinal]] is [[?]]${}_0 = {\vert \mathbb{N}\vert}$: every finite union of finite sets is itself a finite set.

=--

We can now speak of objects that are "$\kappa$-small sums" using the notion of $\kappa$-[[filtered colimits]]:

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For $\kappa$ a [[regular cardinal]], a $\kappa$-[[filtered category]] is one where every [[diagram]] of size $\lt \kappa$ has a [[cocone]].

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

For $\lambda \gt \kappa$ a bigger [[regular cardinal]], every $\lambda$-[[filtered category]] is in particular also $\kappa$-filtered.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A $\kappa$-[[filtered colimit]] is a [[colimit]] over a $\kappa$-filtered diagram.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

An [[object]] $A \in \mathcal{C}$ is a $\kappa$-[[compact object]] if it commutes with $\kappa$-filtered colimits, hence  if for $X \colon I \to \mathcal{C}$ any $\kappa$-[[filtered category|filtered]] [[diagram]], the canonical [[function]]

$$
  \underset{\to_i}{\lim} \mathcal{C}(A,X_i) \to \mathcal{C}(A, \underset{\to_i}{\lim} X_i)
$$

is a [[bijection]]. 

We say $X$ is a **[[small object]]** if it is $\kappa$-compact for _some_ [[regular cardinal]] $\kappa$.

=--

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Remark

If $\lambda \gt \kappa$, then being $\lambda$-compact is a weaker condition that being $\kappa$-comopact. 

=--

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Remark


The object $A$ commutes with the colimit over $I$ precisely if every morphism $A \to \underset{\to_i}{\lim} X_i $ lifts to a morphism $A \to X_j$ into one of the $X_j$. Scematically, depicting specifically a [[sequential colimit]], this means that we have:

$$
  \array{
    \cdots&\to&X_{j-1} &\to& X_j &\to& X_{j+1} &\to& \cdots
    \\
    &&&{}^{\mathllap{\exists \hat f}}\nearrow&\downarrow & \swarrow
    \\
    &&X& \stackrel{f}{\to} & \underset{\to}{\lim} X_i
  }
  \,.
$$

Definition... [[locally presentable category]].


For an abelian group $A$ being generated by $S \hookrightarrow U(S)$ is equivalent to the existence of an [[epimorphism]]

$$
  L \colon F(S) \to A
$$

from the [[free abelian group]] $F(S)$ generated by $S$, hence the group obtained by forming [[formal linear combination|formal sums]] of elements in $S$. Here the epimorphism sends formal sums to actual sums in $A$:

$$
  L(\sum_k s_k) \coloneqq \sum_k \iota(s_k)
  \,.
$$

The [[categorification]] of "[[free abelian group]]" is the notion of _[[free cocompletion]]_ of a category $\mathcal{C}^0$: the [[category of presheaves]] $PSh(\mathcal{C}^0)$. Analogously, we have a functor

$$
  L \colon PSh(\mathcal{C}^0) \to \mathcal{C}
$$

which sends formal colimit to an actual colimit

$$
  L(\underset{\to_k}{\lim} s_k) \coloneqq \underset{\to_k}{\lim} \iota(s_k)
  \,.
$$

Here $L$ by construction preserves all colimits. Therefore conversely, given a colimit-preserving functor $L \colon PSh(\mathcal{C}^0) \to \mathcal{C}$ we want to say that it _locally presents_ $\mathcal{C}$ if $L$ is "suitable epi".

It turns out that suitably epi means: $L$ has a [[section]] by a [[right adjoint]] which is a [[full and faithful functor]] that preserves filtered colimits.

Theorem: Locally presentable categories are equivalently accessbile reflective localizations of presheaf categories.
