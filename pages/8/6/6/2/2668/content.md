# Linear categories

## Idea

A linear category is a [[category]] whose [[hom-sets]] are all [[vector spaces]] (or [[modules]]) and which has all [[direct sums]].

In other words, a linear category is a category which is both [[additive category|additive]] and an [[algebroid]].


## Definitions

Fix a [[commutative ring]] $K$.  (Often we want $K$ to be a [[field]], such as the field $\mathbb{C}$ of [[complex numbers]].)

A __$K$-linear category__ is an [[additive category]] that is [[enriched category|enriched]] over $K\,$[[Mod]], the [[monoidal category]] of $K$-[[modules]] with the usual [[tensor product]].  (Note that we usually speak of $K\,$[[Vect]] instead of $K\,Mod$ when $K$ is a field.)

Note that every additive category is automatically enriched over the category [[Ab]] (or $\mathbb{Z}\,Mod$) of [[abelian groups]] (which are $\mathbb{Z}$-modules); accordingly, a $\mathbb{Z}$-algebroid is the same thing as an [[additive category]].
