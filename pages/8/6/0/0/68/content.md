## Idea

A _differentiable stack_ is a [[geometric stack]] on the [[site]] [[SmoothMfd]] of [[smooth manifold]]s: a stack which is represented by a [[Lie groupoid]].

This means that a differentiable stack is in a way _nothing else_ but a Lie groupoid: but the point is that equivalence of stacks captures the notion of [[Morita equivalence]] of their presenting (Lie) groupoids.

This means that looking at a Lie groupoid in terms of the stack it presents provides a direct way to recognizing the right notion of equivalence of these objects. The notion of Morita equivalence, on the other hand, proceeds via the reasoning of [[homotopy theory]].

Notice that the stack [[presented stack|presented]] by a (Lie) groupoid $G$ is really the stack which sends every test manifold to the category of $G$-principal bundles over that manifold. Such a $G$-principal bundle, also known as a [[torsor]], is analogous to a [[module]] for an algebra. This explains the terminology of "Morita morphisms", which originates in algebra: 

Just as two algebras are Morita equivalent if their categories of modules are equivalent, two groupoids are Morita equivalent if their stacks of torsors are equivalent.

## Properties

### Characterization by Lie groupoids
 {#CharacterizatiobByLieGroupoids}

Sending a [[Lie groupoid]] to the [[smooth stack]] it represents constitutes an [[equivalence of (infinity,1)-categories]] between [[Lie groupoids]] with Morita morphisms/[[bibundles]] between them and differentiable stacks.

(e.g. [Blohmann 2008](#Blohmann08), [Carchedi 2011](#Carchedi11)). For review in a broader context see also [Nuiten 13, around prop. 2.2.34](#Nuiten13)

### Other descriptions

A differentible stack is in particular an object in the [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] [[Smooth∞Grpd]] that is 

* [[1-truncated]] 

* <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/cohesive+(infinity%2C1)-topos#ConcreteObjects">concrete</a>.

It is however more special than that. The general 1-truncated concrete [[smooth ∞-groupoids]] are [[internal groupoids]] in [[diffeological spaces]].

### Mapping stacks

For $X$, $Y$ two differentiable stacks, there is the [[mapping stack]] $[X,Y]$, which a priory is only a [[smooth stack]]. It should be true that a sufficient condition for this itself to be a [[Frechet manifold|Frechet]]-differentiable stack is that $X$ has an [[atlas]] by a [[compact topological space|compact]] [[smooth manifold]].
