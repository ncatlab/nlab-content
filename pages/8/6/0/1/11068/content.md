## Idea

A *flat vector bundle* is a [[vector bundle]] with [[connection on a vector bundle]] which is [[flat connection|flat]].
Specifically a *flat line bundle* is a [[line bundle]] with [[flat connection]].

Under the identification of [[local systems]] --  in the sense of [[locally constant sheaf|locally constant]] and locally [[free module|free]] [[abelian sheaves]] -- with flat vector bundles, the [[flat connection]] induced on these [[vector bundles]] is called the *[[Gauss-Manin connection]]* (e.g. [Voisin 2002, Def. 9.13](#Voisin02)).
