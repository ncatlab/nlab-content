The trace of a [[category]] (or more generally of an endo[[bimodule]] or endo[[profunctor]]) is a [[categorification]] of the [[trace]] of a linear [[endomorphism]] on a finite dimensional [[vector space]] (that is a [[matrix]]). 

A notion of trace is generally definable for maps in a [[compact closed category]] (even more generally in a [[traced monoidal category]]), and here the idea is to categorify this to the context of compact closed [[bicategories]], in particular the bicategory of bimodules between small categories. 


## Definition ##

Let $C$ be a compact closed [[symmetric monoidal category]], with monoidal product $\otimes$ and monoidal unit $1$. The **trace** of an endomorphism $f: c \to c$ is the composite 

$$1 \overset{\eta}{\to} c^* \otimes c \overset{1_{c^*} \otimes f}{\to} c^* \otimes c \overset{\varepsilon}{\to} 1$$ 

where $\eta$ is a unit and $\varepsilon$ is a counit of appropriate [[adjunctions]] (note that the symmetry makes the dual $c^*$ both a right and left adjoint of $c$: the adjunctions are ambidextrous). In the classical case where $C$ is the category of finite-dimensional vector spaces with its usual monoidal structure, this gives the usual trace of an endomorphism; in particular, for $f = 1_c$, this defines $dim(c) \in hom(1, 1)$. 

The same idea applies to compact closed symmetric monoidal bicategories. In particular, it applies to the bicategory [[Prof]] whose objects are small categories, whose 1-morphisms are [[profunctors]] $C \to D$, i.e., functors 

$$R: D^{op} \times C \to Set$$ 

and whose 2-morphisms are [[natural transformations]] between profunctors. The bicategory $Prof$ is a [[cartesian bicategory]] and hence symmetric monoidal under $\times$, and is also compact closed: the dual of a category $C$ in this case is just the opposite category $C^{op}$, and the unit and counit profunctors 

$$\eta: 1 \to C^{op} \times C, \, \varepsilon: C^{op} \times C \to 1$$ 

are given by $hom_{C^{op}}$ and $hom_C$. Composing these (according to the [[coend]] formula for profunctor composition) yields 

$$\int^{c, c' \in Ob(C)} hom(c, c') \times hom(c', c) \cong \int^c hom(c, c)$$ 

and this is the trace of the identity $1_C$ in $Prof$ (which as a functor is also given by $hom_C$); this coend is called the **trace** of the category $C$. It could also reasonably be called, by analogy with the vector space case, the **dimension** of the category $C$. The trace of a general endoprofunctor $F$ on $C$ is the coend 

$$\int^{c \in Ob(C)} F(c, c)$$

which generalizes the trace of linear functions: 

$$Tr(f) = \sum_i f_{i i}$$ 

(where the matrix entries $f_{i j}$ are computed with respect to any basis). 

The foregoing discussion can be generalized to the case of bimodules between small categories enriched in a [[cocomplete category|cocomplete]] symmetric [[monoidal closed category]] $V$, where the dimension of a small $V$-category $C$ is the object of $V$ given by the enriched coend 

$$\int^c hom(c, c)$$ 


## Example ## 

We sketch the calculation of the trace or dimension of [[FinSet]], the category of finite sets. The calculation is quite down-to-earth: the relevant coend is just the quotient of the set of all endofunctions $h: c \to c$ between finite sets, modulo the equivalence relation $\sim$ generated by the stipulation $f \circ g \sim g \circ f$ whenever $f: c \to d$ and $g: d \to c$ are functions between finite sets. 

Let $h: c \to c$ be a finite endofunction, and let 

$$c \overset{p}{\to} d \overset{i}{\to} c$$ 

be its epi-mono factorization. Then $h = (i \circ p) \sim (p \circ i)$; if we think of $d$ as the image $h(c)$, then $p \circ i$ can be viewed as the restriction 

$${h|}\colon h(c) \to h(c)$$ 

and this process iterates. The sequence of epis 

$$h(c) \overset{h|}{\to} h^{(2)}(c) \overset{h|}{\to} \ldots$$ 

eventually stabilizes (after finitely many steps) to a finite set $h^{(\infty)}(c)$ on which $h$ restricts to a [[surjection|surjective]] endofunction, which is a bijection since we are dealing with finite sets. 

This argument shows that the trace of the category of finite sets is isomorphic to the trace of the [[core|underlying groupoid]] of finite sets and bijections. Here the equivalence classes with respect to $\sim$ are the conjugacy classes of [[permutation]]s; in this way, the trace can be identified with the class of finite [[Young diagram]]s.
