## Idea

What has come to be called the _doctrine of ideas_ or the _theory of forms_ is  a central part of the [[philosophy]] of [[Plato]], going back mostly to the [[Parmenides dialogue]].

[[Aristotle]] expands on this. In the 19th century it becomes _[[idealism]]_. With  [[Hegel]] there is "The Idea" in an absolute way ([WdL -- Die Idee](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Science%20of%20Logic#TheIdea)).

## Hegel's perspective
 {#HegelPerspective}

> For Hegel identifies the idea not with Plato's archetype but with [[Aristotle]]'s formal&#8211;final cause. Hegel saw Aristotle, not Plato, as the proper founder of [[absolute idealism]]. ([Beiser 05, p. 66](#Beiser05))

> Hegel contrasts Plato's Idea with "Aristotle's Idea" (sic), ... in contrast to Plato's it makes the end effective ([Ferrarin 04, p. 106](#Ferrarin04))

* [[Georg Hegel]], _[History of Philosophy](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hp/hpconten.htm)_:

> Chapter III: First Period, Third Division

> The third division, which deals with Plato and Aristotle, is found in Greek science where objective thought, the Idea, forms itself into a whole. The concrete, in itself determining Thought, is, with Plato, the still abstract Idea, but in the form of universality; while with Aristotle that Idea was conceived of as the self-determining, or in the determination of its efficacy or activity.

* [[Georg Hegel]], _[History of Philosophy -- Aristotle -- 1. The Metaphysics](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hp/hpconten.htm)_:

> From this definition we now see clearly the sort of opposition in which the Idea of Aristotle stands to that of Plato, for although the Idea of Plato is in itself essentially concrete and determined, Aristotle goes further. In so far, namely, as the Idea is determined in itself, the relation of the moments in it can be more closely specified, and this relation of the moments to each other is to be conceived of as nothing other than activity.

> The Platonic Idea, on the other hand, is rather that abrogation of opposites, where one of the opposites is itself unity. While, therefore, with Plato the main consideration is the affirmative principle, the Idea as only abstractly identical with itself, in Aristotle there is added and made conspicuous the moment of negativity, not as change, nor yet as nullity, but as difference or determination. The principle of individualization, not in the sense of a casual and merely particular subjectivity, but in that of pure subjectivity, is peculiar to Aristotle.
