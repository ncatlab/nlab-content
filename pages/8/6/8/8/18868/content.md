## Idea


There is a unique (up to a scalar) [[hermitian metric]] on  [[complex projective space]], the _[[Fubini-Study metric]]_. 

All analytic subvarieties of a complex projective space are in fact [[algebraic variety|algebraic subvarieties]] and they inherit the [[Kähler manifold structure]] from the projective space. 

Examples include [[complex tori]] $\mathbb{C}^n/L$ where $L$ is a lattice in $\mathbb{C}^n$, [[K3-surfaces]], compact [[Calabi-Yau manifolds]], quadrics, products of projective spaces and so on.
