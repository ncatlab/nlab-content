## Idea

In the [[AQFT]] formalization of [[quantum field theory]] a system is characterized by its [[local net of observables]] on [[spacetime]], which is in particular a [[copresheaf]] of [[algebra]]s. Accordingly, one can consider notions of [[cohomology]] with coefficients in such a [[local net]].

One such notion was introduced in ([Roberts 76](#Roberts76)), there called **local cohomology** or **net cohomology**.  It has been shown to encode the [[DHR superselection theory]] of local nets ([Roberts 90](#Roberts90)).

Here the idea was put forward that [[local net]]s of [[observable]]s should  carry a notion of [[cohomology]] -- or rather of [[nonabelian cohomology]] -- with coefficients in some kind of  [[∞-category]]. Motivated by this John Roberts was one of the first to consider [[strict ∞-categories]]. He conjectured that these are characterized by their [[∞-nerve]]s being [[complicial sets]]. This led [[Ross Street]] to develop the notion of [[oriental]]s and eventually to prove this conjecture. An account of this development is on pages 9-10 of
