[[!redirects Mereology]]


##Idea##
The term **mereology** was coined by the logician Stanislaw Lesniewski from greek 'meros'-part to designate the _study of the parthood relation_.

Traditionally a 'part' of philosophy, the modern mathematical theory started with the work of the _Polish school of logic_ in the early 20th century in the context of the [[foundations of mathematics]]. These early approaches went hand in hand with systems of [[pointless topology]].

More recently, the main impact for the field comes from computer science in the context of _logics for spatial reasoning_ and computer vision.

##Remark
With the inception of topos theory [[William Lawvere]] has conceived of logic from the perspective of mereology by making the role of the [[subobject classifier]] manifest.

More specifically, he has pointed out in the 1980s the relevance of [[co-Heyting algebra|co-Heyting and bi-Heyting structures]] to mereology in this context and proposed to view logical theories from the point of view of a 'mereodynamics'.

[^Lesn]: Caveat: Lesniewski conceives his foundations as layered into a _Protothetik_ , roughly the deductive system or 'logistics', an _ontology_ , roughly the theory of classes, and, _mereology_. This paper that is one in row that stretches from 1927 to 1938 is concerned with the first two layers.
