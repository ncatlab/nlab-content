[[!redirects Mereology]]


##Idea##
**Mereology** is the study of the parthood relation. The term was coined by the logician Stanislaw Lesniewski from greek 'meros' - part.

Traditionally a 'part' of philosophy, the modern mathematical theory started with the work of the _Polish school_ of logic in the early 20th century in the context of the [[foundations of mathematics]]. More recently, the main impact stems from computer science in the context of logics for spatial reasoning and computer vision.

##Remark
With the inception of topos theory [[William Lawvere]] has conceived of logic from the perspective of mereology by making the role of the [[subobject classifier]] manifest.

More specifically, he has pointed out in the 1980s the relevance of co-Heyting and bi-Heyting structures to mereology in this context and proposed to view logical theories from the point of view of a mereodynamics.
