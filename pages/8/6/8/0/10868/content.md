## Idea

Classically, the theory of [[stacks]] was motivated by the study of [[moduli problems]] for which objects are classified up to [[isomorphism]].  Higher stacks are a generalization where objects are classified up to some notion of [[equivalence]], like [[complexes]] up to [[quasi-isomorphism]], [[topological spaces]] up to [[weak homotopy equivalence]], or [[abelian categories]] up to [[equivalence of categories]].
