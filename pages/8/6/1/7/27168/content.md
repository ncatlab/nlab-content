##Â Disambiguation

There are two mutually exclusive definitions of an impredicative [[type universe]] in [[dependent type theory]]. Assuming that a [[type universe]] is closed under [[dependent sum types]], [[dependent product types]], and [[identity types]]/[[path types]]. 

* The first notion of impredicativity is closure under [[power sets]], which in dependent type theory is represented by [[propositional resizing]], since power sets are represented by function sets into the resized [[type of all propositions]] in the universe. 

* The second notion of impredicativity is [[impredicative polymorphism]], the notion that [[universal quantification]] of predicates over the universe in the universe are small. This, in the [[propositions as types]] interpretation, becomes that [[dependent product types]] of universe-indexed families of universe-small types are small.
