[[!redirects fibered category]]
Fibered category is the original name what is here called [[Grothendieck fibration]]. There is also a notion of fibered $n$-category due Claudio Hermida which is defined recursively; for $n=2$ there are also other equivalent definitions, also due Hermida. 


For [[(infinity,1)-category|(∞,1)-categories]] the notion of fibered category is modeled by the notion of [[Cartesian fibration]] of simplicial sets.
