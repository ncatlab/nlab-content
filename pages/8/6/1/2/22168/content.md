## Idea

Notions of [[cohesion - table|cohesion]] are generally treated with [[∞Grpd]] as the [[base (∞,1)-topos]]. However, for the purposes of [[algebraic geometry]] and [[arithmetic geometry]], the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves|(∞,1)-topos of (∞,1)-sheaves]] over the [[pro-étale site]] of a point, $Sh_\infty(ProFinSet)$, may be better suited.

Since this site is used centrally in [[condensed mathematics]], we might call cohesion over this new base, _condensed cohesion_. On the other hand, it is the closed related [[pyknotic set|pyknotic]] approach that constructs an (∞,1)-topos of pyknotic spaces.


## Infinitesimal cohesion

The [[tangent (∞,1)-topos]] of $Sh_\infty(ProFinSet)$ is composed of pairs $(X,A)$ where X is a condensed $\infty$-groupoid and $A \in D(Cond_{/X},\mathbb{S})$ is a [[hypercomplete]] sheaf of [[spectra]] on the site of condensed sets over $X$ ([Scholze a](#Scholze1)). (Pyknotic spectra form the [[stabilization]] of the $(\infty, 1)$-category of pyknotic spaces ([BarHai19, sec 3.1](#BarHai19)).)

## Cohesion

The big pro-étale site on all schemes over a separably closed field $k$ is almost (check) cohesive over the pro-étale site of a point. 

Consider then the construction in [[cohesive (infinity,1)-topos -- structures]] that do not rely on finite-product preservation in the left adjoint.

The [[differential cohomology diagram]] for stable objects in condensed cohesive $(\infty, 1)$-toposes is discussed at ([Scholze a](#Scholze1)).

## Singular cohesion

To treat condensed orbifolds, we might consider the kind of singular cohesion treated at [[orbifold cohomology]], but relative to condensed $\infty$-groupoids.

But see also ([Scholze b](#Scholze2)).
