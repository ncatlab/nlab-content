## Definition

An *ordered reduced local ring* is a [[local ring]] which is both an [[ordered local ring]] and an [[reduced local ring]]: a [[commutative ring]] $R$ with a [[strict weak order]] $\lt$ such that the positive elements form a [[multiplicative subset]] of $R$, the sum of two positive elements is positive, every element $a \in R$ is invertible if and only if it is positive or negative, and every [[nilpotent element]] is equal to zero. 

## Properties

Unlike the [[theory]] of [[ordered fields]], the theory of ordered reduced local rings is a [[coherent theory]].
