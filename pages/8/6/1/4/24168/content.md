## Definition ##


Traditionally, there are two different ways to present [[dependent type theory]]:

* One can present dependent type theory with a [[hierarchy of type universes]] such that every type is a term of a universe of the hierarchy. Examples of such dependent type theories include the one found in the [[HoTT book]] and the proof assistants [[Agda]], [[Coq]], [[Lean]], and its variants like [[Cubical Agda]]. 

* Alternatively, one can present dependent type theory with a separate type [[judgment]] and no [[type universes]] at all. Examples of such dependent type theories include the one found in [[Egbert Rijke]]'s [[Introduction to Homotopy Type Theory]]. 

From these two notions of dependent type theory, there are two notions of a *univalent type theory*:

* In the first case, a **univalent type theory** is a [[dependent type theory]] with [[identity types]], [[dependent product types]], and [[dependent sum types]] such that all universes in the universe hierarchy satisfy the [[univalence axiom]]. 

* In the second case, a **univalent type theory** is a [[dependent type theory with type variables]] and with [[identity types]], [[dependent product types]], [[dependent sum types]], and [[identity type#IdentityTypesBetweenTypes|identity types between types]] such that the [[univalence axiom]] holds in the type theory. 

These univalent type theories usually have additional types such as the [[empty type]], the [[unit type]], the [[booleans]], and the [[natural numbers type]], making it into a [[Martin-Löf dependent type theory]].
