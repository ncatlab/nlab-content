__George P&#243;lya__ (December 13, 1888 &#8211; September 7, 1985) was a Hungarian mathematician (natively: P&#243;lya Gy&#246;rgy) who worked in many fields of mathematics, including [[combinatorics]], analysis, probability and [[arithmetic]]. He was the author of a number of books on the heuristics of mathematical research, that is, methods to formulate and solve problems. Against the trend of considering mathematical reasoning to be wholly deductive, P&#243;lya wrote on analogical and [[inductive reasoning]] in mathematics.
