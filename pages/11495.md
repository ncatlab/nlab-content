## Idea

For $A$ an [[abelian group]] there is a group [[automorphism]]

$$
  - \;\colon \; A \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} A
$$

given by sending any element $a$ to its [[inverse]] $-a$.

This is an [[involution]].

## Examples


* The inversion involution on the [[multiplicative group]] induces, via the [[Goerss-Hopkins-Miller theorem]] the [[real oriented cohomology theory]] structure on [[complex K-theory]] [[KU]] (namely [[KR-theory]]), see at _[[moduli stack of tori]]_ for details.
