## Idea

In [[physics]], a *mass term* is, quite generally, the [[sum|summand]] in a [[Lagrangian density]], [[Hamiltonian]] or [[equation of motion]] which expresses the [[mass]] of a given [[particle]] of [[field (physics)|field]].

Often the terminology is used specifically for masses of [[spinors]]/[[Dirac fields]], since here a mass term is subject to subtle constraints which may or may not exclude the mere existence of admissible mass terms.

Schematically, if a massless relativistic [[Dirac equation]] (here in [[Minkowski spacetime]]) is written in the form

$$
  \partial_0 \psi
  \;=\;
  k\!\!\!/ \cdot \psi
  \,,
$$

where $k\!\!\!/$ are the [[Feynman slash|Clifford momentum]]-[[linear operator|operator]], then for a mass term addition

$$
  \partial_0 \psi
  \;=\;
  k\!\!\!/ \cdot \psi
  \;+\;
  m \gamma_0
  \,,
$$

to lead to the required [[special relativity|relativistic]] [[dispersion relation]]

$$
  E \,=\, \sqrt{k^2 + m^2}
$$

one needs that the new [[Clifford algebra|Clifford]]-generator $\gamma_0$ exists as an operator on the given [[Hilbert space]] of [[spinor]] $\psi$ such that it skew-commutes with all the Clifford momenta

$$
  \gamma_0 \cdot k\!\!\!/ 
  \;+\;
  k\!\!\!/\cdot \gamma_0 
  \;=\;
  0
  \,.
$$

This is the kind of relation that also appears in [[Karoubi K-theory|Karoubi]]'s formlation of [[topological K-theory]]-classes as [[equivalence classes]] of  [[Clifford modules]] (see [Freed & Hopkins 2021, Thm. 9.63](#FreedHopkins21)). 

In this guise, mass terms for [[electron]]-excitations in [[semi-metals]] play a role in the [[K-theory classification of topological phases of matter]] (see [below](#ExamplesInTopologicalPhasesOfMatter)).


## Examples

### In topological phases of matter
 {#ExamplesInTopologicalPhasesOfMatter}

In [[solid state physics]] of [[crystals]], [[electrons]] are typically well-approximated by the non-relativistic Dirac equation, but around nodal points in the [[Brillouin torus]], where [[electronic band structure|electron bands]] cross, the effective [[dispersion relation]] is again of form of a relativistic Dirac- or Weyl-equation (whence one speaks of *Dirac points* or *Weyl points*).

This phenomenon appears in particular in [[topological semi-metals]], in which case the existence of a mass term, whose addition to the [[dispersion relation]] will remove the band crossing by "opening an energy gap", is thought to signal the decay of the [[semi-metal]]-phase into a [[topological insulator]]-phase.
