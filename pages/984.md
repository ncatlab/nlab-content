Let $\Lambda$ denote the [[cycle category]] of [[Alain Connes]].  A __cyclic object__  in a [[category]] $C$ is a $C$-valued [[presheaf]] on $\Lambda$.  Equivalently it is a [[simplicial object]] $F_\bullet$ together with a sequence of isomorphisms $t_n : F_n \rightarrow F_n$, $n\geq 1$, such that
$$\array{
\partial_i t_n = t_{n-1} \partial_{i-1},\,\, i \gt 0, &
\sigma_i t_n = t_{n+1} \sigma_{i-1},\,\, i \gt0, \\
\partial_0 t_n = \partial_n, & \sigma_0 t_n = t_{n+1}^2 \sigma_n,\\
t^n_{n+1} = \mathrm{id}
}$$
where $\partial_i$ are boundaries, $\sigma_i$ are degeneracies.
