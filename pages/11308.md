
Different things are called _characteristic series_ in mathematics. For instance

* the [[formal power series]] characterizing a [[genus]] (see there) of oriented or stable almost complex manifolds

* in group theory, a [[subgroup series]] of a group $G$ is termed a _characteristic series_ if all members of the series are [[characteristic subgroup]]s of $G$. For instance, a [[central series]] is a characteristic series.
