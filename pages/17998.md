## Idea

A [[discrete group]] $\Gamma$ is called an _acyclic group_ if its [[classifying space]] $B \Gamma$ is an "acyclic space" in that its [[ordinary cohomology]] $H^\bullet(B \Gamma, \mathbb{Z})$ vanishes in all positive degree, so that 

$$
  H^\bullet(B \Gamma, \mathbb{Z}) \simeq \mathbb{Z}
  \,.
$$

The existence of acyclic groups is one reason why [[rational homotopy theory]] restricts attention to [[simply-connected topological spaces]].
