The __cohomological descent__ is the question if the derived analogue of the (co)monadic comparison functor is fully faithful (or more rarely an equivalence of categories) when formulated at the level of total derived functors and derived categories, and usually taken with respect to [[hypercovers]]. 

The [[cohomological descent]] has been introduced in

* [[Pierre Deligne]], _Théorie de Hodge. III_, Inst. Hautes Études Sci. Publ. Math. __44__ (1974), 5--77. 

A summary is also in

* [[Donu Arapura]], _Building mixed Hodge structures_, in: The arithmetic and geometry of algebraic cycles (Banff, AB, 1998), 13--32,
CRM Proc. Lecture Notes, 24, Amer. Math. Soc., Providence, RI, 2000.
