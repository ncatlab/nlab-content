## Definition

A __Hilbert W\*-module__ is a [[Hilbert C*-module]] $M$
over a [[von Neumann algebra]] $A$
such that $M$ admits a [[predual]] as a [[Banach space]].

## Properties

For any [[von Neumann algebra]] $A$,
the category of [[Hilbert W*-modules]] over $A$ is equivalent to the category of [[W*-representations]] of $A$.

The equivalence is implemented by the following functors.

Given a [[Hilbert W*-module]] $M$,
we send it to the [[completion]] of $M\otimes_A L^2(A)$,
where $L^2(A)$ is the Haagerup standard form of $A$.

Given a [[W*-representation]] $R$,
we send it to the [[internal hom]] $Hom_A(L^2(A), R)$,
which is a [[Hilbert W*-module]] over $A$.
