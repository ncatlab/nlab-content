A _relation_ is the extension of a [[predicate]].  That is, if you have a statement whose [[truth value]] may depend on some variables, then you get a relation that consists of those instantiations of the variables that make the statement true.  Equivalently, you can think of a relation as a [[function]] whose [[target]] is the set of truth values.

## Definitions ##

### General case ###

Given a family $(A_i)_{i: I}$ of [[set]]s, a **relation** on that family is a [[subset]] of the [[cartesian product]] $\prod_{i: I} A_i$.  Equivalently, a **relation** is a [[function]] from $\prod_{i: I} A_i$ to the set $\TV$ of [[truth value]]s (because $\TV$ is the [[subobject classifier]] in [[Set]]).

### Special cases ###

A __nullary relation__ is a relation on the empty family of sets.  This is the same as a [[truth value]].

A __unary relation on $A$__ is a relation on the singleton family $(A)$.  This is the same as a [[subset]] of $A$.

A __binary relation on $A$ and $B$__ is a relation on the family $(A,B)$, that is a subset of $A \times B$.  This is also called a __relation from $A$ to $B$__, especially in the context of the $2$-category [[Rel]] described below.

A __binary relation on $A$__ is a relation on $(A,A)$, that is a relation from $A$ to itself.  This is sometimes called simply a __relation on $A$__.

An __$n$-ary relation__ on $A$ is a relation on a family of $n$ copies of $A$, that is a subset of $A^n$.

For a binary relation, one often uses a symbol such as $\sim$ and writes $a \sim b$ instead of $(a,b) \in \sim$.  Actually, even when a relation is given by a letter such as $R$, one often sees $a R b$ instead of $(a,b) \in R$, although now that does not look so good.

## Morphisms ##

If $A$ and $B$ are each sets equipped with a relation, then what makes a [[function]] $f: A \to B$ a _morphism_ of sets so equipped?

There are really two ways to do this, shown below.  (We will write these as if each set is equipped with a binary relation $\sim$, but any fixed arity would work.)
*  $f$ __preserves__ the relation if $x \sim y \;\Rightarrow\; f(x) \sim f(y)$ always;
*  *f* __reflects__ the relatin if $x \sim y \;\Leftarrow\; f(x) \sim f(y)$ always.

Now, if $f$ is a [[bijection]], then it preserves the relation if and only if its inverse reflects it, so clearly an [[isomorphism]] of relation-equipped sets should do both.  What about a mere morphism?

In general, it\'s more natural to require only preservation; these are the morphisms you get if you consider a set with a relation as a models of a [[algebraic theory|finite-limit theory]] or a simply [[directed graph]].

But in some contexts, particularly when dealing only with [[irreflexive relation]]s, we instead require (only) that a morphism reflect the relation.  Sometimes an even stricter condition is imposed, as for [[well-order]]s.  But even in these cases, the definition of isomorphism comes out the same.

## Binary relations ##

Binary relations are especially widely used.

### Kinds of binary relations ###

Special kinds of relations from $A$ to $B$ include:
* [[functional relation]]s;
* [[entire relation]]s.

A [[function]] can be seen as a binary relation that is both functional and entire.

Special kinds of binary relations on $A$ additionally include:
* [[reflexive relation|reflexive]] and [[irreflexive relation|irreflexive]] relations;
* [[symmetric relation|symmetric]], [[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]], and [[asymmetric relation|asymmetric]] relations;
* [[transitive relation]]s and [[comparison]]s;
* left and right [[euclidean relation]]s;
* [[total relation|total]] and [[tight relation|tight]] relations;
* [[extensional relation|extensional]] and [[well-founded relation|well-founded]] relations.

Combinations of the above properties of binary relations produce [[equivalence relation]]s, [[apartness relation]]s, and the various kinds of [[order]]s.

### The $2$-poset of binary relations ###

Binary relations form a $2$-[[2-category|category]] (in fact a $2$-[[2-poset|poset]]) [[Rel]], which is the basic example of an [[allegory]].

The objects are [[set]]s, the morphisms from $A$ to $B$ are the binary relations on $A$ and $B$, and there is a $2$-morphism from $R$ to $S$ (both from $A$ to $B$) if $R$ implies $S$ (that is, when $(a,b) \in R$, then $(a,b) \in S$).

The interesting definition is composition:  If $R$ is a relation from $A$ to $B$ and $S$ is a relation from $B$ to $C$, then the composite (written $S \circ R$ or $R;S$) from $A$ to $C$ is defined as follows:
$$(a,c) \in R;S \;\Leftrightarrow\; \exists b: B,\; (a,b) \in R \;\wedge\; (b,c) \in S.$$
The identity morphism is given by [[equality]].

The special properties of the kinds of binary relations listed earlier can all be described in terms internal to $\Rel$; most of them make sense in any allegory.  Irreflexive and asymmetric relations are most useful if the allegory\'s [[hom-object|hom-poset]]s have [[bottom]] elements, and linear relations require this.  Comparisons require the hom-posets to have finite [[union|unions]], and well-founded relations require some sort of higher-order structure.

As a [[function]] may be seen as a functional, entire relation, so the category [[Set]] of sets and functions is a [[subcategory]] of [[Rel]] (in fact a [[replete subcategory|replete]] and locally [[full subcategory|full]] sub-$2$-category).

## Generalisation ##

Most of the preceding makes sense in any [[category]] with enough [[product]]s.  Probably the trickiest bit is the definition of composition of binary relations, so not every category with finite products has an allegory of relations.  In fact, in a certain precise sense, a category has an allegory of relations if and only if it is [[regular category|regular]].  It can then be recovered from this allegory by looking at the functional and entire relations.
