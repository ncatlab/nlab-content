[arXiv:0910.1132](http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/0910.1132) Explicit non-abelian Lubin-Tate theory for GL(2)
from arXiv Front: math.AG by Jared Weinstein
Let $F$ be a non-Archimedean local field with residue field $k$ of odd
characteristic, and let $B/F$ be the division algebra of rank 4. We explicitly
construct a stable curve $\mathfrak{X}$ over the algebraic closure of $k$
admitting an action of $GL_2(F)\times B^\times \times W_F$ which realizes the
Jacquet-Langlands correspondence and the local Langlands correspondence in its
cohomology.

[arXiv:0911.5238](http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/0911.5238) Continuous homotopy fixed points for Lubin-Tate spectra
from arXiv Front: math.AT by Gereon Quick
We construct a stable model structure on profinite symmetric spectra with a
continuous action of an arbitrary profinite group. This provides a natural
framework for a new construction of homotopy fixed point spectra and of
homotopy fixed point spectral sequences for the action of the extended Morava
stabilizer group on Lubin-Tate spectra. These continuous homotopy fixed points
are canonically equivalent to the homotopy fixed points of Devinatz and Hopkins
but have a drastically simplified construction.
