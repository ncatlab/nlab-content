The **canonical topology** on a [[category]] $C$ is the [[Grothendieck topology]] on $C$ which is the largest [[subcanonical site|subcanonical]] topology.  More explicitly, a [[sieve]] $R$ is a [[covering]] for the canonical topology iff every [[representable functor]] is a [[sheaf]] for every [[pullback]] of $R$.  Such sieves are called *universally effective-epimorphic*.

If $C$ is a [[Grothendieck topos]], then the canonical covering sieves are those that are jointly [[epimorphism|epimorphic]].  Moreover, in this case the canonical topology is generated by *small* jointly epimorphic families, since $C$ has a small [[generator|generating set]].  The canonical topology of a Grothendieck topos is also special in that every sheaf is representable; that is, $C \simeq Sh(C)$.
