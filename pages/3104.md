## Definition 

The **canonical topology** on a [[category]] $C$ is the [[Grothendieck topology]] on $C$ which is the largest [[subcanonical site|subcanonical]] topology.  More explicitly, a [[sieve]] $R$ is a [[covering]] for the canonical topology iff every [[representable functor]] is a [[sheaf]] for every [[pullback]] of $R$.  Such sieves are called *universally effective-epimorphic*.

## Examples

### On a Grothendieck topos

If $C$ is a [[Grothendieck topos]], then the canonical [[covering]] [[sieves]] are those that are jointly [[epimorphism|epimorphic]].  Moreover, in this case the canonical topology is generated by *small* jointly epimorphic families, since $C$ has a small [[generator|generating set]].  

The canonical topology of a Grothendieck topos is also special in that every [[sheaf]] is [[representable functor|representable]]; that is, $C \simeq Sh_{canonical}(C)$.

Notice that if $(D,J)$ is a site of definition for the topos $C$, then this says that

###### Proof

For simplicity, assume $(\mathbb{C}, J)$ is a [[small site|small]] [[subcanonical topology|subcanonical]] [[site]]. The quasi-inverse of the [[Yoneda embedding]] $\mathbf{Sh}(\mathbb{C}, J) \to \mathbf{Sh}(\mathbf{Sh}(\mathbb{C}, J))$ has a very simple description: it is the [[functor]] that sends a [[sheaf]] $F : \mathbf{Sh}(\mathbb{C}, J)^\mathrm{op} \to \mathbf{Set}$ to its restriction along the [[Yoneda embedding]] $\mathbb{C} \to \mathbf{Sh}(\mathbb{C}, J)$.

Indeed, suppose $F : \mathbf{Sh}(\mathbb{C}, J)^\mathrm{op} \to \mathbf{Set}$ is a sheaf. We claim that $F$ is determined up to unique [[isomorphism]] by its restriction along the embedding $\mathbb{C} \to \mathbf{Sh}(\mathbb{C}, J)$. Indeed, let $X : \mathbb{C}^\mathrm{op} \to \mathbf{Set}$ be a $J$-sheaf. Then $X$ is the [[colimit]] of a canonical small [[diagram]] of [[representable functor|representable]] [[sheaves]] on $(\mathbb{C}, J)$ in a canonical way. Consider the colimiting [[cocone]] on $X$: it is a universal [[effective epimorphism|effective epimorphic]] family and is therefore a [[covering]] family in the canonical topology on $\mathbf{Sh}(\mathbb{C}, J)$. Thus, $F (X)$ is indeed determined up to unique isomorphism by the restriction of $F$ to $\mathbb{C}$. We must also show that the restriction is actually a sheaf on $(\mathbb{C}, J)$; but this is true because $J$-covering [[sieves]] in $\mathbb{C}$ become universal effective epimorphic families in $\mathbf{Sh}(\mathbb{C}, J)$.

Thus we obtain a functor $\mathbf{Sh}(\mathbf{Sh}(\mathbb{C}, J)) \to \mathbf{Sh}(\mathbb{C}, J)$ that is left quasi-inverse to the embedding $\mathbf{Sh}(\mathbb{C}, J) \to \mathbf{Sh}(\mathbf{Sh}(\mathbb{C}, J))$, and the argument above shows that it is also a right quasi-inverse.
