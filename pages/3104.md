## Definition 

The **canonical topology** on a [[category]] $C$ is the [[Grothendieck topology]] on $C$ which is the largest [[subcanonical site|subcanonical]] topology.  More explicitly, a [[sieve]] $R$ is a [[covering]] for the canonical topology iff every [[representable functor]] is a [[sheaf]] for every [[pullback]] of $R$.  Such sieves are called *universally effective-epimorphic*.

## Examples

### On a Grothendieck topos

If $C$ is a [[Grothendieck topos]], then the canonical [[covering]] [[sieves]] are those that are jointly [[epimorphism|epimorphic]].  Moreover, in this case the canonical topology is generated by *small* jointly epimorphic families, since $C$ has a small [[generator|generating set]].  

The canonical topology of a Grothendieck topos is also special in that every [[sheaf]] is [[representable functor|representable]]; that is, $C \simeq Sh_{canonical}(C)$.

Notice that if $(D,J)$ is a site of definition for the topos $C$, then this says that
