We give two constructions of the simplicial localization of a [[homotopical category]].  

We first need the following preparations:

Let $\mathbf{T}$ be the [[zigzag category]].  We define the _categorical realization_ of a zigzag $t=(n,t_+,t_-)$ to be the category $[t]$ generated freely by the following [[quiver]] data:

* $[t]$ has $n+1$ vertices $t_0,...,t_n$
* If $i\in t_+$, there is an edge $g_i:t_{i-1}\to t_i$
* If $i\in t_-$, there is an edge $g_i:t_i\to t_{i-1}$

Let $C$ be a [[homotopical category]] with class of weak equivalences $W$.  Consider the functor category $Hom_{Cat}([t],C)$.  We define the category of _restricted_ $t$-zigzags $C^{t}$ to be the subcategory whose objects are zigzags $F$ such that all maps $F(t_i)\to F(t_{i-1})\in W$, and where morphisms are given by object-wise weak equivalences (natural weak equivalences).  Finally, we define $C^t(X,Y)$ to be the full subcategory of $C^t$ spanned by those objects $F$ such that $F(t_0)=X$ and $F(t_n=Y)$.  

Let $f:t\to t'$ be a morphism of $\mathbf{T}$.  Then we define the functor $f_*:C^t(X,Y)\to C^{t'}(X,Y)$ to be the functor sending a zigzag $F:[t]\to C$ with connecting maps $g_i$ lying between $t_{i-1}$ and $t_i$ (not necessarily $t_{i-1}\to t_i$) to the zigzag $f_*F:[t']\to C$ with connecting maps $h_j$ defined to be the ordered composite of the maps $g_i$ such that $i\in f^{-1}(j)$ (Note: There should be a better combinatorial way to precisely specify this, but I'm having trouble doing so).  Notice that if $f^{-1}(j)$ is empty, this procedure yields the identity map.  On morphisms, everything remains well-defined by the naturality.   This proves that the assignment $C^{(t)}(X,Y):\mathbf{T} \to Cat$ is functorial in $t$.  

Notice that this is not actually functorial in $X$ and $Y$, but for a map $Z\to X$, we can give a functor $C^t(X,Y)\to C^{1\vee t}(Z,Y)$.  Similarly, for a map $Y\to Z$, we can give a map $C^{t}(X,Y)\to C^{t \vee 1}(X,Z)$.  This is a special case of concatenation, which we will describe as follows:

We may concatenate two combinatorial zigzags $t=(n,t_+,t_-)$ and $t'=(m,t'_+,t'_-)$ in the obvious way by taking $t\vee t'$ to be the combinatorial zigzag $(n+m, t_+ \cup n(t'_+), t_- \cup n(t'_-))$ where $n(S):=\{n+i: i\in S\}$ is the map adding $n$ to each index.  This is clearly functorial in both coordinates and defines a monoidal product $\vee:\mathbf{T}\times \mathbf{T}\to \mathbf{T}$.  

We will lift this to a functor $\vee^{t,t'}_{XYZ}:C^t(X,Y)\times C^{t'}(Y,Z)\to C^{t\vee t'}(X,Z)$.  We send a pair of zigzags to their concatenation in the obvious way.  On morphisms, we concatenate natural transformation diagrams, the result of which remains natural by the hammock-shape of our natural transformation diagrams (see below), so $\vee^{t,t'}_{XYZ}$ is a functor in both coordinates.  

$$\begin{matrix}
&&A_1&\to&A_2&\leftarrow&A_3&\to&\ldots&\to &A_{n-3}&\leftarrow &A_{n-2}&\to& A_{n-1}&&\\
&\nearrow&\downarrow&&\downarrow&&\downarrow&&&&\downarrow&&\downarrow&&\downarrow&\searrow&\\
X&&\downarrow&&\downarrow&&\downarrow&&&&\downarrow&&\downarrow&&\downarrow&&Y\\
&\searrow&\downarrow&&\downarrow&&\downarrow&&&&\downarrow&&\downarrow&&\downarrow&\nearrow&\\
&&B_1&\to&B_2&\leftarrow&B_3&\to&\ldots&\to &B_{n-3}&\leftarrow &B_{n-2}&\to& B_{n-1}&&\end{matrix}$$

(Note that this picture is technically hiding the identity morphisms $X\to X$ and $Y\to Y$.  We omit them to show the hammock-shape, as noted below).

We note that we must define everything pointwise for the moment, but it's reasonable expect all of this data to lift to an actual composition functor in the colimit over $\mathbf{T}$, perhaps after some effort.  

With this data in hand, we may proceed to actual constructions of the simplicial categories that we want.

Before that, a short note on terminology:  Traditionally, only the second construction is called the hammock localization, but this name comes from the shape of a natural transformation between two $t$-zigzags with the same initial and terminal vertices (notice how much the figure above looks like a hammock!), but as we will see, this features in both constructions.  We could say that both constructions are "hammock localizations", and indeed, they produce weakly equivalent results.


####Simplicial localization via the Grothendieck Construction####

By the [[Grothendieck construction]], we may present the functor $C^t(X,Y):\mathbf{T}\to Cat$ as a [[fibered category]] $GrC^\mathbf{T}(X,Y)$ over $\mathbf{T}$.  

In the sequel, we will construct the strict 2-category $GrC$ with the same objects as $C$ and with morphism categories $GrC^\mathbf{T}(X,Y)$. 

The first order of business is to show that the $\vee^{t,t'}_{XYZ}$ assemble first to a functor $\vee_{XYZ}:GrC^\mathbf{T}(X,Y)\times GrC^\mathbf{T}(Y,Z)\to GrC^\mathbf{T}(X,Z)$.  After that, we must show that all $\vee_{XYZ}$ assemble to an associative composition law respecting identities.

Unrelated theorem

**Theorem**: The categorical nerve $N(GrC)$ sending objects to objects and hom-categories to simplicial sets $N(GrC^\mathbf{T}(X,Y))$ equips $N(GrC)$ with the structure of a simplicial category.  Further, the morphisms of the homotopy category of this simplicial category coincide with those of the homotopy category arising from the ordinary construction using equivalence relations.  That is, $Ho_C(X,Y)\cong \pi_0 (N(GrC(X,Y)))$ naturally in $X$ and $Y$, where $\pi_0(-):=Hom_{Ho(SSet)}(Ho(\Delta^0), Ho(-))$.
