## Idea

### General

For a [[crystal|crystalline material]], [[Bloch-Floquet theory]] shows that the [[Hilbert space]] [[space of quantum states|of quantum states]] of the [[electrons]] (in the [[background field|background]] of the [[atoms]]/[[nuclei]] at the crystal sites) is [[natural transformation|naturally]] the [[space of sections]] of a [[separable Hilbert space]]-bundle over the [[Brillouin torus]], and the [[Hamiltonian]] is the [[direct integral]] of [[Bloch Hamiltonians]] on its [[fibers]], whose [[eigenvalues]] constitute the [[electronic energy bands]].  If the [[chemical potential]] of the electrons lies in a gap between two such [[electronic energy bands]], then this Hilbert space bundle has a well-defined [[sub-bundle]] of Bloch states with energy below the chemical potential. 

One says that the vectors in this vector bundle are the electron [[quantum states]] which are "filled" and one says that the vector bundle over the [[Brillouin torus]] which these form is the *valence bundle* of the system, and that the [[electronic band structure|band]] formed by (the [[graph of a function|graph]]) of the corresponding [[energy]] [[eigenvalues]] is the *valence band*.

The orthogonal complement of the valence bundle inside the ambient Bloch Hilbert bundle would be known as the *conduction bundle*, though this term is not widely used. But the (lowest) [[electronic band structure|band]] which is constituted by the corresponding [[energy]] [[eigenvalues]] is commonly known as the *conduction band*.

\begin{remark}
Sometimes the valence bundle is referred to as a "Bloch bundle", eg. [Panati 06](#Panati06). This can be confusing, since the latter term would more naturally apply to the full Hilbert bundle of all Bloch states.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
For [[metals]] the chemical potential is not inside a gap, and a valence sub-bundle is not really well-defined, though the valence *band* is still defined. For [[semi-metals]] there is a well-defined valence bundle on the [[complement]] of its nodal points in the [[Brillouin torus]].
\end{remark}

### Classification

As a [[sub-bundle]] of the full a Hilbert space bundle of a quantum system, the valence bundle is naturally identified not up to [[isomorphism]] but up to ambient isomorphism, hence up to [[Murray-von Neumann equivalence]]. In fact, it has been argued to be physically classified by its class in [[topological K-theory]] (i.e. the [[Grothendieck group completion]] of the [[semigroup]] of Murray-von Neumann equivalence classes under [[direct sum of vector bundles]]), or rather by the [[twisted equivariant K-theory]] reflecting the material's [[quantum symmetries]]. This is the statement of the *[[K-theory classification of topological phases of matter]]*.
