A **canonical hypergroup** is a set, $H$, equipped with a commutative binary operation, $+$, taking values in non-empty subsets of $H$, and a zero element $0$, such that

1. $+$ is associative (extended to allow addition of subsets of $H$);
1. $0 + x = x = x + 0, \forall x \in H$;
1. $\forall x \in H \exists ! y (= - x) \in H$ such that $0 \in x + y$;
1. $\forall x, y, z \in H, x \in y + z$ implies $z \in x - y$.

The additive structure of a [[hyperring]] is a canonical hypergroup.
