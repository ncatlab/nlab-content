## Definition

The [[category]] of _effective [[pure motives|pure]] Chow [[motives]]_ , $Mot_{rat}^{eff}(k)$, is the [[idempotent completion]] of the [[category]] $Corr_{rat}(k)$ whose [[objects]] are [[smooth variety|smooth]] [[projective varieties]] over some [[field]] $k$, and whose [[hom-sets]] are [[Chow groups]] in the [[product]] of two varietes (see for instance [Vishik09, def. 2.1](#Vishik09)).

$$
  Hom_{Corr_{rat}(k)}(Y,X) \coloneqq CH^{dim X}(X \times Y)
  \,.
$$

Hence a [[morphism]] $X \to Y$ in $Mor_{rat}^{eff}(k)$ is an [[equivalence class]] of [[linear combinations]] of [[correspondences]]/[[spans]] of the form

$$
  X \leftarrow \Sigma \rightarrow Y
  \,.
$$

If one furthermore divides out the [[Lefschetz motive]] $\mathbf{L}$ then one obtains the category of _pure Chow motives_

$$
  Mot_{rat}(k) \coloneqq Mot_{rat}(k)[\mathbf{L}^{-1}]
  \,.
$$

This was introduced by [[Grothendieck]]. See e.g. ([Vishik09, p. 6](#Vishik09)), ([Mazza-Voevosky-Weibel, p. 181](#MazzaVoevodskyWeibel)).

This is a special case of the more general notion of _[[pure motives]]_. See there for more.

## Properties

### Relation to Voevodsky motives

There is a [[full and faithful functor]] from the category of Chow motives into that of [[Voevodsky motives]]:

$$
  Chow^{eff} \hookrightarrow DM^{eff}
  \,.
$$

(e.g [Mazza-Voevodsky-Weibel, prop. 20.1](#MazzaVoevodskyWeibel))

### Relation to noncommutative Chow motives

The relation between Chow motives and [[noncommutative Chow motives]] is recalled as theorem 4.6 in ([Tabuada 11](#Tabuada11)).

This relation is best understood via _[[K-motives]]_, see there.

### Relation to KK-theory

The definition of Chow motives in algebraic geometry is somewhat analogous to the construction of [[KK-theory]] in [[noncommutative topology]]. See at _[KK-theory -- Relation to motives](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/KK-theory#AsAnAnalogOfMotives)_.
