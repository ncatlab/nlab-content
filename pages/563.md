## Idea

A **pseudofunctor** is a specific algebraic notion of _weak $2$-[[2-functor|functor]]_ between [[bicategory|bicategories]] (including [[strict 2-category|strict 2-categories]]), i.e. a functor which preserves composition and identities only up to [[coherent]] specified [[isomorphism]].


In general, there is not much reason to say "pseudofunctor" instead of "functor," since by far the most important type of functor between arbitrary bicategories is weak.  However, if the domain and codomain are known to be [[strict 2-category|strict 2-categories]] (including ordinary $1$-[[1-category|categories]]), it can be helpful to say "pseudofunctor" or "weak functor" to emphasize that it is not a [[strict 2-functor]].  Note that if the codomain is a $1$-category, then there is no difference.

Pseudo or weak functors are also to be distinguished from [[lax functor]]s and [[lax functor|oplax functor]]s, which preserve identities and composition only up to a  transformation in one direction or the other, which may be non-invertible.

An older terminology, which should probably be avoided at all costs, uses "homomorphism of bicategories" for a weak functor and "morphism of bicategories" for a lax one.


## Definition

Given [[bicategories]] $C$ and $D$, a __pseudofunctor__ (or __weak $2$-functor__, or just __functor__) $P\colon C \to D$ consists of:

*  for each [[object]] $x$ of $C$, an object $P_x$ of $D$;
*  for each [[hom-category]] $C(x,y)$ in $C$, a [[functor]] $P_{x,y}\colon C(x,y) \rightarrow D(P_x,P_y)$;
*  for each object $x$ of $C$, an invertible [[2-morphism]] ($2$-cell) $P_{\id_x}\colon \id_{P_x} \Rightarrow P_{x,x}(\id_x)$;
*  for each triple $x,y,z$ of $C$-objects, a [[natural isomorphism|isomorphism]] (natural in $f\colon x \to y$ and $g\colon y \to z$) $P_{x,y,z}(f,g)\colon P_{x,y}(f) ; P_{y,z}(g) \Rightarrow P_{x,z}(f;g)$;
*  for each hom-category $C(x,y)$,
   $$ \array {
                                  &                                         & \id_{P_x} ; P_{x,y}(f) \\
                                  & {}^{P_{\id_x};\id_{P_{x,y}(f)}}\swArrow &                        & \seArrow^{\lambda_{P_{x,y}(f)}} \\
      P_{x,x}(\id_x) ; P_{x,y}(f) &                                         &                        &                                 & P_{x,y}(f) \\
                                  & {}_{P_{x,x,y}(\id_x,f)}\seArrow         &                        & \neArrow_{P_{x,y}(\lambda_f)} \\
                                  &                                         & P_{x,y}(\id_x;f) \\
   } $$
   and
   $$ \array {
                                  &                                         & P_{x,y}(f) ; \id_{P_y} \\
                                  & {}^{\id_{P_{x,y}(f)};P_{\id_y}}\swArrow &                        & \seArrow^{\rho_{P_{x,y}(f)}} \\
      P_{x,y}(f) ; P_{y,y}(\id_y) &                                         &                        &                              & P_{x,y}(f) \\
                                  & {}_{P_{x,y,y}(f,\id_y)}\seArrow         &                        & \neArrow_{P_{x,y}(\rho_f)} \\
                                  &                                         & P_{x,y}(f;\id_y) \\
   } $$
   commute; and
*  for each quadruple $w,x,y,z$ of $C$-objects,
   $$ \array {
      \big(P_{w,x}(f) ; P_{x,y}(g)\big) ; P_{y,z}(h)       & \overset{\alpha_{P_{w,x}(f),P_{x,y}(g),P_{y,z}(h)}}\Rightarrow & P_{w,x}(f) ; \big(P_{x,y}(g) ; P_{y,z}(h)\big) \\
      \mathllap{P_{w,x,y}(f,g);\id_{P_{y,z}(h)}}\Downarrow &                                                                & \Downarrow\mathrlap{\id_{P_{w,x}(f)};P_{x,y,z}(g,h)} \\
      P_{w,y}(f;g) ; P_{y,z}(h)                            &                                                                & P_{w,x}(f) ; P_{x,z}(g;h) \\
      \mathllap{P_{w,y,z}(f;g,h)}\Downarrow                &                                                                & \Downarrow\mathrlap{P_{w,x,z}(f,g;h)} \\
      P_{w,z}\big((f;g);h\big)                             & \underset{P_{w,z}(\alpha_{f,g,h})}\Rightarrow                  & P_{w,z}\big(f;(g;h)\big) \\
   } $$
   commutes.

## Pseudofunctors versus lax functors

If we remove the requirement that $P_{\id_x}$ and $P_{x,y,z}(f,g)$ be invertible, then we have the definition of __[[lax functor]]__.  Thus, a pseudofunctor may be defined as a lax functor whose comparison constraints are invertible.

If in the definition of lax functor we reverse the direction of the constraints, then we have an __[[oplax functor]]__.  Thus, if we consider the *inverses* of the constraints of a pseudofunctor, we obtain an oplax functor.  Because there is little difference between specifying an invertible morphism and specifying its invertible inverse, one could equally well define a pseudofunctor to be an oplax functor whose constraints are invertible (i.e. reverse the direction of the isomorphisms $P_{\id_x}$ and $P_{x,y,z}(f,g)$ above), and in the literature one sometimes finds this definition instead.

Of course, in particular applications, one direction or the other may be slightly more "natural".  For instance, when a [[Grothendieck fibration]] $E\to B$ gives rise to a pseudofunctor $B^{op} \to Cat$, the natural comparison maps (induced by the universal property of [[cartesian arrows]]) go in the "lax direction".  Dually, when a Grothendieck opfibration $E\to B$ gives rise to a pseudofunctor $B\to Cat$, the natural comparison maps go in the "oplax direction".


## History

Historically the term 'pseudofunctor' was conceived by [[Grothendieck]] who weakened, around 1957, the concept of a [[contravariant functor]] from a [[1-category]] to [[Cat]], by effectively replacing the $1$-category Cat by the [[2-category]] $Cat$ and allowing (contravariant) functoriality up to coherent $2$-cells. This was recorded in his [[Bourbaki]] seminar on [[descent]] via pseudofunctors. Later in [[SGA1]] Grothendieck (with the assistance of [[Pierre Gabriel]]) replaced pseudofunctors in the treatment of descent by more invariant [[fibered categories]]. [[Benabou]], in his 1967 treatise introducing [[bicategories]], generalized the pseudofunctors of Grothendieck to pseudofunctors between arbitrary bicategories but under the name 'homomorphism of bicategories'.
