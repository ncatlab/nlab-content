## Idea

In [[logic]], *sequent calculus* refers to a style of logical or type-theoretical calculi in which the rules are structured in pairs of left and right rules so as to ensure that the resulting system has the subformula property (see below).

Most sequent calculi furthermore enjoy [[cut elimination]]: every sequent provable with cut is provable without. Together with the subformula property this establishes consistency of the system.

## Example of sequent calculi

### LK: Gentzen's system for classical logic

LK was Gentzen's original sequent calculus for classical logic.

### LJ: Gentzen's system for intuitionistic logic

### Systems for linear logic

### Focusing

### One-sided sequent calculi

For classical systems (including linear classical systems), where negation is involutive, it is possible to reduce the number of rules by half, using one-sided sequent calculi. These are sometimes referred to as Tait style calculi.
