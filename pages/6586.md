[[universal construction]] (having universal property), e.g. limits, representable object etc. 

Terminal object is also called a universal [[terminal object]] and an initial object is also called a universal [[initial object]]. There is also a notion of [[universal arrow]].

While every colimit has a universal property, there is also an additional  terminology. A colimit is a [[universal colimit]] if it is [[stability under pullback|stable under pullback]]s.
