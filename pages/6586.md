[[universal construction]] (having universal property), e.g. limits, representable object etc. 

A [[terminal object]] is also called a universal terminal object, and an [[initial object]] is also called a universal initial object. There is also a notion of [[universal arrow]].

While every colimit has a universal property, there is also an additional  terminology. A colimit is a [[universal colimit]] if it is [[stability under pullback|stable under pullback]]s.
