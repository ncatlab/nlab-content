## Idea

In [[number theory]], the _Goldbach conjecture_ is the [[conjecture]] that

_Every [[even number]] great than 2 is the [[sum]] of two [[prime numbers]]_.

## Properties

### Relation to Betrand's postulate

It was observed in [Ricardo 05](#Ricardo05) that Goldbach conjecture implies  a simple proof of [[Bertrand's postulate]] (which has been proven, independently of the Goldbach conjecture). See [there](Bertrand's+postulate#ProofFromGoldbach) for details.
