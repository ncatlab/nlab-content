## Idea

To every complex 3-dimensional [[Calabi-Yau variety]] $X$ are associated two similar but differing typesof [[sigma-model]] $N=2$-supersymmetric [[2d CFTs]]. There is at least for some CY $X$ a map $X \mapsto \hat X$ which exchanges the [[Hodge numbers]] $h^{1,1}$ and $h^{1,2}$ such that $SCFT_A(X)$ is expected to be equivalent to $SCFT_B(\hat X)$. 

$$
  SCFT_A(X) \simeq SCFT_B(\hat X)
  \,.
$$

This is called _mirror symmetry_. At least in some cases this can be understood as a special case of [[T-duality]].

In this form mirror symmetry remains a conjecture, not the least because for the moment there is no complete construction of these SCFTs. But to every such $SCFT(X)$ one can associate two [[TCFT]]s, $A(X)$ and $B(X)$, the [[A-model]] and the [[B-model]]. These $N=1$ supersymmetric field theories were obtained by [[Edward Witten]] using a "topological twist". The topological A-model can be expressed in terms of [[symplectic geometry]] of a variety and the topological B-model can be expressed in terms of the [[algebraic geometry]] of a variety. 

These topological theories are easier to understand and do retain a little bit of the information encoded in the full SCFTs. In terms of these the statement of mirror symmetry says that passing to mirror CYs _exchanges_ the A-model with the $B$-model and conversely:

$$
  A(X) \simeq B(\hat X),\,\,\,\,\,\,\,B(X)\simeq A(\hat X)
  \,.
$$

By a version of the [[cobordism hypothesis]]-theorem, these [[TCFT]]s (see there) are encoded by [[A-∞ categories]] that are [[Calabi-Yau categories]]: the [[A-model]] by the [[Fukaya category]] $Fuk(X)$ of $X$ which can be understood as a [[stable (∞,1)-category]] representing the Lagrangean intersection theory on the underlying [[symplectic manifold]]; and the [[B-model]] by an [[enhanced triangulated category|enhancement]] of the [[derived category]] of [[coherent sheaves]] $D^b_\infty(\hat X)$ on $\hat X$.

In terms of this data, mirror symmetry is the assertion that these [[A-∞ categories]] are equivalent and simultaneously the same under exchange $X\leftrightarrow \hat{X}$:

$$
  Fuk(X) \simeq D^b_\infty(\hat{X}),
\,\,\,\, and \,\,\,\,
Fuk(\hat{X}) \simeq D^b_\infty(X).
$$

This categorical formulation was introduced by [[Maxim Kontsevich]] in 1994 under the name **homological mirror symmetry**. The equivalence of the categorical expression of mirror symmetry to the SCFT formulation has been proven by [[Maxim Kontsevich]] and independently by [[Kevin Costello]], who showed how the datum of a topological conformal field theory is equivalent to the datum of a [[Calabi-Yau category|Calabi-Yau A-∞-category]](see [[TCFT]]).


The mirror symmetry conjecture roughly claims that every Calabi-Yau 3-fold has a mirror. In fact one considers (mirror symmetry for) degenerating families for Calabi-Yau 3-folds in large volume limit (what can be expressed precisely via the Gromov-Hausdorff metric). The appropriate definition of (an appropriate version of) the [[Fukaya category]] of a symplectic manifold is difficult to achieve in desired generality. 
Invariants/tools of Fukaya category include symplectic [[Floer homology]] and Gromov-Witten invariants (building up the [[quantum cohomology]]). Mirror symmetry is related to the [[T-duality]] on each fiber of an associated Lagrangian fibration (Strominger-Yau-Zaslow conjecture).  

Although the non-Calabi-Yau case may be of lesser interest to physics, one can still formulate some mirror symmetry statements for, for instance, Fano manifolds. The mirror to a Fano manifold is a Landau-Ginzburg model (see Hori-Vafa; see also work of Auroux for an explanation via the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow T-duality philosophy). Then the statements are: the A-model of the Fano (given by the Fukaya category) is equivalent to the B-model of the Landau-Ginzburg model (given by the category of matrix factorizations); and the B-model of the Fano (given by the derived category of sheaves) is equivalent to the A-model of the Landau-Ginzburg model (given by the Fukaya-Seidel category). A few of the relevant names: Kontsevich, Hori-Vafa, Auroux, Katzarkov, Orlov, Seidel, ...
