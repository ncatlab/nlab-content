A normal space is a space (typically a [[topological space]]) which satsifies one of the stronger [[separation axiom]]s.

## Defintions

A topological space $X$ is __normal__ if it satisfies:

* $T_4$: for every two closed disjoint subsets $A,B\subset X$ there are open [[neighborhoods]] $U\supset A$, $V\supset B$ such that $U\cap V$ is [[inhabited set|inhabited]].

Often one adds the requirement

* $T_1$: every point in $X$ is closed.

One may also see terminology where a _normal space_ is any space that satsifies $T_4$, while a _$T_4$ space_ must satisfy both.  This has the benefit that a $T_4$-space is always also a $T_3$-space while still having a term available for the weaker notion.  On the other hand, the reverse might make more sense, since you would expect any space that satisfies $T_4$ to be a $T_4$-space; this convention is also seen.

If instead of $T_1$, you add only

* $R_0$: if $x$ is in the closure of $\{y\}$, then $y$ is in the closure of $\{x\}$,

then the result may be called an __$R_3$-space__.

Any space that satisfies both $T_4$ and $T_1$ must be [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]], and every Hausdorff space satisfies $T_1$, so one may call such a space a __normal Hausdorff space__; this terminology should be clear to any reader.

Any space that satisfies both $T_4$ and $R_0$ must be [[regular space|regular]] (in the weaker sense of that terms), and every regular space satisfies $R_0$, so one may call such a space a __normal regular space__; however, those who interpret 'normal' to include $T_1$ usually also interpret 'regular' to include $T_1$, so this term can be ambiguous.


## Remarks

The class of normal spaces was introduced by Tietze (1923) and Aleksandrov--Uryson (1924). 

Every [[metric space]] is normal Hausdorff. Every normal Hausdorff space is an Urysohn space, a fortiori regular and a fortiori Hausdorff.
Every regular [[second countable space]] is normal. Every [[paracompact space|paracompact]] Hausdorff space is normal (Dieudonné's theorem). For normal spaces, the [[Tietze extension theorem]] holds.
