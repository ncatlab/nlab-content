# Bases and subbases

## Idea

For many notions of [[structure]], particularly for [[topological concrete category|topological categories]], one can specify a structure by a _base_ or _subbase_ that generate the structure.  Besides being convenient ways to specify a structure, they may even be necessary when using weak [[foundations]].

Warning:  Sometimes one says '[[basis]]' instead of 'base', but I think that it\'s safest to save the former for the generating set of a [[free object]], especially in an [[algebraic category]].  Although a basis and a base can both generate something, they tend to behave in very different ways.  (It doesn\'t help that 'bases' is the plural of both.)

Typically, every structure of an appropriate type is both a base and a subbase for itself, while every base is a subbase.  Bases and subbases can also be characterised independently; every subbase generates a base (which tends to be _saturated_ in some way), while every base (saturated or not) generates a complete structure.


## Examples

### Bases for filters

Recall that a [[filter]] on a [[poset]] $P$ is a [[subset]] of $P$ such that

### Bases for topologies

Recall that a [[topological space|topology]] on a

### Bases for uniform structures

## General theory

Is there a general theory of bases?  That\'s a good question.  I don\'t know!
