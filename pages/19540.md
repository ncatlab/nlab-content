## Idea

The [[category]] of [[differential graded-commutative superalgebras]] over a [[field]] of [[characteristic zero]] carries a _projective_ [[model category]] [[structure]] whose [[weak equivalences]] are the underlying [[quasi-isomorphisms]] and whose [[fibrations]] are the degreewise [[surjections]] (all either in unbounded degree, in non-negative degree or in non-positive degree).

This is the [[transferred model structure]] of the projective [[model structure on chain complexes of super vector spaces]], transferred along the [[forgetful functor]] to underlying chain complexes.
 
The model structure is hence the direct generalization of the projective [[model structure on differential graded-commutative algebras]], to which it reduces on the objects concentrated in even super-degree.
