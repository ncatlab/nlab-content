## Idea

A [[space]] $X$ is called **formally smooth** if every [[morphism]]s $Y \to X$ into it has all possible [[infinitesimal object|infinitesimal]] extensions.

Traditionally this has considered in the context of [[geometry]] over formal duals of [[ring]]s and [[associative algebra]]s. This we discuss in the section ([Concrete notion](#ConcreteNotion)). But generally the notion makes sense in any context of <a href="http://nlab.mathforge.org/nlab/show/cohesive+%28infinity%2C1%29-topos#InfinitesimalCohesion">infinitesimal cohesion</a>. This we discuss in the section 
[General abstract notion](#GeneralAbstractNotion).

## General abstract notion
 {#GeneralAbstractNotion}


Let 

$$
  \mathbf{H}
   \stackrel{\overset{u^*}{\hookrightarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{u_*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{u^!}{\to}}}
  \mathbf{H}_{th}   
$$

be a triple of [[adjoint functor]]s with $u^*$ a [[full and faithful functor]] that preserves the [[terminal object]]. 

We may think of this as exhibiting <a href="http://nlab.mathforge.org/nlab/show/cohesive+%28infinity%2C1%29-topos#InfinitesimalCohesion">infinitesimal cohesion</a> (see there for details, but notice that in the notation used there we have $u^* = i_!$, $u_* = i^*$ and $u^! = i_*$). 

We think of the objects of $\mathbf{H}$ as [[cohesive topos|cohesive space]]s and of the objects of $\mathbf{H}_{th}$ as such cohesive spaces possibly equipped with [[infinitesimal object|infinitesimal extension]]. 

As a class of examples that is useful to keep in mind consider a [[Q-category]] $(cod \dashv \epsilon \dashv dom) : \bar A \to A$  of <a href="http://nlab.mathforge.org/nlab/show/Q-category#InfinitesimalThickening">infinitesimal thickening of rings</a> and let

$$
  ((u^* \dashv u^_* \dashv u^!) : \mathbf{H}_{th} \to \mathbf{H}) := 
  ([dom,Set] \dashv [\epsilon, Set] \dashv [codom,Set] \ [\bar A, Set] \to [A,Set])
$$ 

be the corresponding <a href="http://nlab.mathforge.org/nlab/show/Q-category#PresheafQCategory">Q-category of copresheaves</a>.

For any such setup there is a canonical [[natural transformation]]

$$
  u^* \to u^!
  \,.
$$

Details of this are in the section <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/cohesive%20topos#AdjointQuadruples">Adjoint quadruples</a> at [[cohesive topos]].

From this we get for every morphism $f : X \to Y$ in $\mathbf{H}$ a canonical morphism

\[
  \label{MorphismIntoPullback}
  u^* X \to u^* Y \prod_{u^! Y} u^! X
  \,.
\]

###### Definition

A morphism $f : X \to Y$ in $\mathbf{H}$ is called **formally smooth** if (eq:MorphismIntoPullback) is an [[effective epimorphism]].

This appears as ([KontsevichRosenberg, def. 5.1, prop. 5.3.1.1](#KontsevichRosenbergSpaces)).

###### Definition

An object $X \in \mathbf{H}$ is called **formally smooth** if the morphism $X \to *$ to the [[terminal object]] is formally smooth.

###### Proposition

The object $X$ is formally smooth precisely if 

$$
  u^* X \to u^! X
$$

is an [[effective epimorphism]].

## Concrete notion
 {#ConcreteNotion}

In the context of geometry over formal duals of [[ring]]s and [[associative algebra]]s there are two definitions




* Grothendieck's notion of formal smoothness for [[commutative rings]], [[schemes]], morphisms (or even more general functors $Scheme^{op}\to Set$) which will be discussed here. 



In EGA IV, Grothendieck defines formal smoothness in the generality of relative setup: for morphisms. Formal smoothness is weaker than smoothness, and there are characterizations when formally smooth morphisms are smooth.


### Over commutative rings 
 {#OverCommutativeRings}

A morphism $f :X\to Y$ is __formally smooth__ if   it satisfies the _infinitesimal lifting property_: for every ring $A$ and nilpotent [[ideal]] $I\subset A$ and morphism $Spec(A)\to Y$ the induced map

$$ Hom_Y(Spec(A), X)\to Hom_Y(Spec(A/I),X)$$

is surjective. 

This is due to ([[EGAIV]]${}_4$ 17.1.1)

#### Smoothness versus formal smoothness 

For a morphism $f:X\to Y$ of schemes, and $x$ a point of $X$, the following are equivalent

(i) $f$ is smooth at $x$

(ii) $f$ is locally of finite presentation at $x$ and there is an open neighborhood $U\subset X$ of $x$ such that $f|_U: U\to Y$ is formally smooth

(iii) $f$ is flat at $x$, locally of finite presentation at $x$ and the sheaf of [[Kähler differential]]s $\Omega_{X/Y}$ is locally free in a neighborhood of $x$

The relative dimension of $f$ at $x$ will equal the rank of the module of Kähler differentials. 

This is ([[EGAIV]]${}_4$ 17.5.2 and 17.15.15)


#### Formally smooth scheme 

A [[scheme]] $S$, i.e. a scheme over the ground ring $k$, is a [[formally smooth scheme]] if the corresponding morphism $S \to Spec(k)$ is a formally smooth morphism.

There is also an interpretation of formal smoothness via the formalism of [[Q-categories]].
