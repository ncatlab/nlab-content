## Idea

The 2-[[sphere]] $S^2$ is naturally equipped with the structure of a [[symplectic manifold]] with symplectic form its canonical [[volume form]], up to a constant factor. As such, one can consider its [[geometric quantization]]. 

From the point of view of [[physics]], this is a [[mechanical system]] that describes a rigid [[rotor]] or [[spinor]] in 3-dimenensional [[Euclidean space]] (and just the rotation/spin degrees of freedom, not the translational degrees of freedom).

More abstractly in [[mathematics]], the 2-sphere is naturally identified with a [[coadjoint orbit]] of the [[special unitary Lie algebra]]/[[special unitary group]] $\mathfrak{su}(2)/SU(2)$ (and hence of the [[spin group]] $Spin(3)$, by one of the [exceptional isomorphisms](spin+group#ExceptionalIsomorphisms)). As such the [[geometric quantization]] of the 2-sphere is a special case of the general [[orbit method]]. In this case it identifies the quantization of the [[Hamiltonian action]] of $SU(2)$ on $S^2$ in terms of [[quantum operators]] acting on the [[space of quantum states]] with an [[irreducible representation]] of $SU(2) \simeq Spin(3)$.
