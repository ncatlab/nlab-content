## Idea

A [[model category]] structure on a category of [[spectra]] presents a [[stable (∞,1)-category]] of [[spectrum objects]].

Many such model structures model spectrum objects as _[[symmetric spectra]]_. See there for more details.

Typically and naturally, a model structure on spectra forms a [[stable model category]].

## Examples

Among the model structures with a [[symmetric monoidal smash product of spectra]] ("highly structured spectra") are

* [[model structure on symmetric spectra]]

* [[model structure on orthogonal spectra]]

* [[model structure on S-modules]]

## Related concepts

* [[model structure on presheaves of spectra]]

* [[model structure for dendroidal left fibrations]]

* [[higher algebra]], [[brave new algebra]], [[higher linear algebra]]

* [[stable (infinity,1)-category]]
