## Idea

A [[model category]] structure on a category of [[spectra]] presents a [[stable (∞,1)-category]] of [[spectrum objects]].

Typically and naturally, a model structure on spectra forms a [[stable model category]]. In good cases it also forms a [[symmetric monoidal model category]] with respect to the [[smash product of spectra]], see at _[[symmetric monoidal smash product of spectra]]_.

## Examples

A classical model structure on [[sequential spectra]] in [[simplicial sets]], not however with a symmetric monoidal smash product, is ([Bousfield-Friedlander 78](#BousfieldFriedlander78)) the 

* _[[Bousfield-Friedlander model structure]]_.

This is related by a [[zig-zag]] of [[Quillen equivalences]] to the 

* _[[model structure on combinatorial spectra]]_.

A [[Quillen equivalence|Quillen equivalent]] model structure to the Bousfield-Friedlander model structure that does carry a [[symmetric monoidal smash product of spectra]] is the

* _[[model structure for excisive functors]]_.

Among the model structures on "[[highly structured spectra]]" with a [[symmetric monoidal smash product of spectra]] are the

* [[model structure on orthogonal spectra]],

* [[model structure on symmetric spectra]],

* [[model structure on S-modules]].
