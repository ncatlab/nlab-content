## Idea

A [[model category]] structure on a category of [[spectra]] presents a [[stable (∞,1)-category]] of [[spectrum objects]].

Typically and naturally, a model structure on spectra forms a [[stable model category]]. In good cases it also forms a [[symmetric monoidal model category]] with respect to the [[smash product of spectra]], see at _[[symmetric monoidal smash product of spectra]]_.

## Examples

A classical model structure, not however with a symmetric monoidal smash product, is ([Bousfield-Friedlander 78](#BousfieldFriedlander78)).

Among the model structures with a [[symmetric monoidal smash product of spectra]] ("highly structured spectra") are

* [[model structure on symmetric spectra]]

* [[model structure on orthogonal spectra]]

* [[model structure on S-modules]]

as well as

* [[model structure for excisive functors]]
