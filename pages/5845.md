###### Definition

An __adjoint triple__ of functors 

$$
  ( F\dashv G\dashv H) : C \to D 
$$

is a triple of [[functor]]s $F,H \colon C \to D$ and $G \colon D \to C$ together with [[adjunction]] data $F\dashv G$ and $G\dashv H$.

## Properties

+-- {: .num_note #GIsBicontinuous}
###### Note

The two adjunctions imply of course that $G$ preserves all [[limit]]s and [[colimit]]s that exist in $D$.

###### Note


Every adjoint triple 

$$
  (F \dashv G \dashv H) : C \to D
$$ 

gives rise to an [[adjunction|adjoint pair]] 

$$
  (G F \dashv G H) : C \to C
$$ 

consisting of a [[monad]] $G F$ [[left adjoint]] to the [[comonad]] $G H$ on $C$;

as well as an adjoint pair

$$
   ( F G \dashv H G ) : D \to D
   \,.
$$

See [[adjoint monad]] for more.

In general there is a duality (an anti[[equivalence of categories]]) between the category of monads having right adjoint and comonads having left adjoints.  Note also that the [[algebra over a monad|algebras]] for a left-adjoint monad can be identified with the coalgebras for its right adjoint comonad.

###### Proposition

For an adjoint triple $F\dashv G\dashv H$ we have that $F$ is [[full and faithful functor|fully faithful]] precisely if $H$ is fully faithful.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By a basic <a href="http://nlab.mathforge.org/nlab/show/adjoint+functor#FullyFaithfulAndInvertibleAdjoints">property</a> [[adjoint functor]] we have that 

* the [[left adjoint]] $F$ being full and faithful is equivalent to the [[unit of an adjunction|unit]] $Id \to G F$ being a [[natural isomorphism]];

* the [[right adjoint]] $H$ being full and faithful is equivalent to the counit $G H \to Id$ being a [[natural isomorphism]].

Moreover, by note \ref{AdjointPairFromAdjointTriple} and the fact that adjoints are unique up to isomorphism, we have that $G F$ is isomorphic to the identity precisely if $G H$ is.

## Examples

### Special cases

* An adjoint triple $F\dashv G\dashv H$ is **Frobenius** if $F$ is naturally isomorphic to $H$. See [[Frobenius functor]].

* An *[[affine morphism]]* is an adjoint triple of functors in which the middle term is [[conservative functor|conservative]]. For example, any [[affine morphism of schemes]] induce an affine triples of functors among the categories of [[quasicoherent module]]s.

* An adjoint triple of functors among $A_\infty$- or [[triangulated functor]]s with certain additional structure is called **spherical** . See e.g. ([Anno](#Anno)). The main examples come from [[Serre functor]]s in a [[Calabi-Yau category]] context. 

### Specific examples

* Given any [[ring]] [[homomorphism]] $f^\circ: R\to S$ (in commutative case dual to s an [[affine morphism]] $f: Spec S\to Spec R$ of [[affine schemes]]), there is an adjoint triple $f^*\dashv f_*\dashv f^*$ where $f^*: {}_R Mod\to {}_S Mod$ is an [[extension of scalars]], $f_*: {}_S Mod\to {}_R Mod$ the restriction of scalars and $f^! : M\mapsto Hom_R ({}_R S, {}_R M)$ its [[right adjoint]]. This triple is affine in the above sense.
