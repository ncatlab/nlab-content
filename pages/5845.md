## Definition

###### Definition

An __adjoint triple__ of functors 

$$
  ( F\dashv G\dashv H) : C \to D 
$$

is a triple of [[functor]]s $F,H \colon C \to D$ and $G \colon D \to C$ together with [[adjunction]] data $F\dashv G$ and $G\dashv H$.

###### Note

The two adjunctions imply of course that $G$ preserves all [[limit]]s and [[colimit]]s that exist in $D$.

###### Note


Every adjoint triple 

$$
  (F \dashv G \dashv H) : C \to D
$$ 

gives rise to an [[adjunction|adjoint pair]] 

$$
  (G F \dashv G H) : C \to C
$$ 

consisting of a [[monad]] $G F$ [[left adjoint]] to the [[comonad]] $G H$ on $C$;

as well as an adjoint pair

$$
   ( F G \dashv H G ) : D \to D
   \,.
$$

See [[adjoint monad]] for more.

In general there is a duality (an anti[[equivalence of categories]]) between the category of monads having right adjoints and comonads having left adjoints.  Note also that the [[algebra over a monad|algebras]] for a left-adjoint monad can be identified with the coalgebras for its right adjoint comonad.

### Fully faithful adjoint triples

+-- {: .num_prop #FullyFaithful}
###### Proposition

For an adjoint triple $F\dashv G\dashv H$ we have that $F$ is [[full and faithful functor|fully faithful]] precisely if $H$ is fully faithful. 

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By a basic <a href="http://nlab.mathforge.org/nlab/show/adjoint+functor#FullyFaithfulAndInvertibleAdjoints">property</a> of [[adjoint functors]] we have that 

* the [[left adjoint]] $F$ being full and faithful is equivalent to the [[unit of an adjunction|unit]] $Id \to G F$ being a [[natural isomorphism]];

* the [[right adjoint]] $H$ being full and faithful is equivalent to the counit $G H \to Id$ being a [[natural isomorphism]].

Moreover, by note \ref{AdjointPairFromAdjointTriple} and the fact that adjoints are unique up to isomorphism, we have that $G F$ is isomorphic to the identity precisely if $G H$ is. 

Finally, by a standard fact about [[adjoint functor]]s (for instance (([Elephant, lemma 1.1.1](#Elephant))) $G H$ is isomorphic to the identity precisely if it is so by the [[unit of an adjunction|adjunction unit]].

=--

This is often the case when $D$ is a category of "spaces" structured over $C$, where $F$ and $H$ construct "discrete" and "codiscrete" spaces respectively.

For instance, if $G\colon D\to C$ is a [[topological concrete category]], then it has both a left and right adjoint which are fully faithful.  Not every fully faithful adjoint triple is a topological concrete category (among other things, $G$ need not be [[faithful functor|faithful]]), but they do exhibit certain similar phenomena.  In particular, we have the following.

+-- {: .num_prop #FinalLifts}
###### Proposition
Suppose $(F \dashv G \dashv H) \colon C \to D$ is an adjoint triple in which $F$ and $H$ are fully faithful, and suppose that $C$ is [[cocomplete category|cocomplete]].  Then $G$ admits [[final lift|final lifts]] for [[small category|small]] $G$-structured [[sinks]].
=--
+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
Let $\{G(S_i) \to X\}$ be a small sink in $C$, and consider the diagram in $D$ consisting of all the $S_i$, all the counits $\varepsilon\colon F G(S_i) \to S_i$ (where $F$ is the left adjoint of $G$), and all the images $F G(S_i) \to F(X)$ of the morphisms making up the sink.  The colimit of this diagram is preserved by $G$ (since it has a right adjoint as well).  But the image of the diagram consists essentially of just the sink itself (since $F$ is fully faithful, $G(\varepsilon)$ is an isomorphism), and its colimit is $X$; hence the colimit of the original diagram is a lifting of $X$ to $D$ (up to isomorphism).  It is easy to verify that this lifting has the correct universal property.
=--

Thus, we can talk about objects of $D$ having the [[weak structure]] or [[strong structure]] induced by any small collection of maps.

+-- {: .num_cor #Fibration}
###### Corollary
In the situation of Proposition \ref{FinalLifts}, $G$ is a ([[Street fibration|Street]]) [[Grothendieck fibration|opfibration]].  If it is also an [[isofibration]], then it is a Grothendieck opfibration.
=--
+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
A final lift of a singleton sink is precisely an opcartesian arrow.
=--

Dually, of course, if $C$ is complete, then $G$ admits initial lifts for small $G$-structured cosinks and is a fibration.

In particular, the proposition and its corollary apply to a [[cohesive topos]], and (suitably categorified) to a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]].


## Examples

### Special cases

* An adjoint triple $F\dashv G\dashv H$ is **Frobenius** if $F$ is naturally isomorphic to $H$. See [[Frobenius functor]].

* An *[[affine morphism]]* is an adjoint triple of functors in which the middle term is [[conservative functor|conservative]]. For example, any [[affine morphism of schemes]] induce an affine triples of functors among the categories of [[quasicoherent module]]s.

* An adjoint triple of functors among $A_\infty$- or [[triangulated functor]]s with certain additional structure is called **spherical** . See e.g. ([Anno](#Anno)). The main examples come from [[Serre functor]]s in a [[Calabi-Yau category]] context. 

### Specific examples

* Given any [[ring]] [[homomorphism]] $f^\circ: R\to S$ (in commutative case dual to s an [[affine morphism]] $f: Spec S\to Spec R$ of [[affine schemes]]), there is an adjoint triple $f^*\dashv f_*\dashv f^*$ where $f^*: {}_R Mod\to {}_S Mod$ is an [[extension of scalars]], $f_*: {}_S Mod\to {}_R Mod$ the restriction of scalars and $f^! : M\mapsto Hom_R ({}_R S, {}_R M)$ its [[right adjoint]]. This triple is affine in the above sense.
