## Definition

Traditionally, a **wide subcategory** of a [[category]] $C$ is a [[subcategory]] containing all the [[objects]] of $C$. 

Equivalently, it is a subcategory through which the canonical [[functor]] $disc(Obj(C)) \to C$ (from the [[discrete category]] on the collection of [[objects]]) factors, or whose inclusion functor is [[bo functor|bijective on objects]].

Notice that the condition to contain all the objects is not invariant under [[equivalence of categories]] and so the definition of wide subcategory above violates the [[principle of equivalence]].  A variant of the definition which fixes this is:

an **essentially wide subcategory** contains at least one object from each [[isomorphism class]] of objects; that is, its inclusion functor is [[essentially surjective functor|essentially surjective on objects]].


A wide subcategory is also called a **lluf subcategory** ("lluf" being "[[full subcategory|full]]" spelled backwards).
