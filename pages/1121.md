A **wide subcategory** of a [[category]] $C$ is a [[subcategory]] containing all the [[object]]s of $C$. 

Equivalently, it is a subcategory through which the canonical [[functor]] $disc(Obj(C)) \to C$ (from the [[discrete category]] on the collection of [[objects]]) factors, or whose inclusion functor is [[bo functor|bijective on objects]].

A wide subcategory is also called a **lluf subcategory** ("lluf" being "[[full subcategory|full]]" spelled backwards).

Note that this is an [[evil]] condition (on top of whatever evil is in the term 'subcategory').  To fix this, let an **essentially wide subcategory** contain at least one object from each isomorphism class of objects; that is, its inclusion functor is [[essentially surjective functor|essentially surjective on objects]].
