
New Foundations (NF) is a version of axiomatic [[set theory]] in which there is a set of all sets, but the comprehension axiom is restricted by a "stratification" condition.

The [[category]] of sets and functions in NF is known to not be [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]], so it is not a [[topos]], but can be equipped with [[finite limits]] and a [[subobject classifier]]. One can even construct a set of all functions between two sets, but there is no evaluation map $A\times B^A \to B$ making this an exponential in the category.

There are at least three proofs of this fact: one, due to Randall Holmes, doesn't seem to have been made public; the others are due to McLarty and Forster, and derive contradictions (different in the two proofs) from assumptions on the behaviour of a pairing function used to construct binary products.

For a long time the (relative) consistency of NF was an open problem, although NF with urelements (NFU) was known to be consistent (relative to ZF plus some large cardinals).  Recently there [may be](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/132103/the-status-of-the-consistency-of-nf-relative-to-zf) a proof of its consistency.
