## Idea

The notion of _étale morphism of schemes_ is the realization of the general notion of [[étale morphism]] for maps between [[schemes]], hence it captures roughly the idea of a map of schemes which is a [[local homeomorphism]]/[[local diffeomorphism]].

A central use of étale morphisms of schemes is that they appear as [[coverings]] in the [[Grothendieck topology]] of the [[étale site]]. The [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] with respect to these étale covers of schemes is accordingly called _[[étale cohomology]]_.



## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn #EquivalentConditionsForEtale}
###### Definition

A [[morphism]] of [[schemes]] is an **étale morphism** if the following equivalent conditions hold:

1. it is

   1. [[smooth morphism of schemes|smooth]] 

   1. [[unramified morphism|unramified]] 

1. it is

   1. [[smooth morphism of schemes|smooth]] 

   1. of [[relative dimension]] $0$. 

1. it is 

   1. [[flat morphism|flat]] 

   1. [[unramified]];

1. it is

   1. [[formally étale morphism of schemes|formally étale]];

   1. [[locally of finite presentation]]

=---

(A number of other equivalent definitions are listed at [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etale_morphism).)  

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

For morphisms $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ between [[algebraic varieties]] over an [[algebraically closed field]] this means that for all points $p \in X$ the induced morphism on [[tangent cones]]

$$
  T_p X \longrightarrow T_{f(p)} Y
$$

is an [[isomorphism]]. This is analogous to the corresponding characterization of [[local diffeomorphisms]] of [[smooth manifolds]].

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Relaxing the finiteness condition in item 4 of \ref{EquivalentConditionsForEtale} yields the notion of _[[weakly étale morphism]]_.

[[étale morphism of schemes|étale morphism]] $\Rightarrow$ [[pro-étale morphism of schemes|pro-étale morphism]] $\Rightarrow$ [[weakly étale morphism of schemes|weakly étale morphism]] $\Rightarrow$ [[formally étale morphism of schemes|formally étale morphism]]

###### Definition

A jointly surjective collection of étale morphisms $\{U_i \to X\}$ is called an [[étale cover]].

=--


+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Most of the pairs of conditions in def. \ref{EquivalentConditionsForEtale} can be read as constraining the fiber of the morphism to be first suitably surjective/[[bundle]]-like ([[smooth morphism of schemes|smooth]], [[flat morphism|flat]]) and second suitably locally injective ([[unramified]]).

Specifically the first condition has an [[infinitesimal object|infinitesimal anlog]]: a [[formally étale morphism]] is a [[formally smooth morphism|formally smooth]] and [[formally unramified morphism]]. These notions also have an interpretation in [[synthetic differential geometry]] and there they correspond to the statement that a [[local diffeomorphism]] is a [[submersion]] which is also an [[immersion of smooth manifolds]].

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A morphism is **[[formally étale morphism]]** if it is 

* [[formally smooth]] (satisfying an infinitesimal lifting property) 

* and [[formally unramified]]. 

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

These are sheaf-like properties, which can be formalized in the language of [[Q-categories]] ([[monopresheaf]] and [[epipresheaf]] properties on the $Q$-category of nilpotent thickenings).

## Properties


### Closure properties

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

* A [[composite]] of two étale morphism is itself étale.

* The [[pullback]] of an étale morphism is étale.

* If $f_1 \circ f_2$ is étale and $f_1$ is, then so is $f_2$.

(e.g. [Milne, prop. 2.11](#Milne))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Use that an étale morphism is a [[formally étale morphism]] with finite fibers, and that $f \colon X \to Y$ is formally étale precisely if the [[infinitesimal shape modality]] [[unit of a monad|unit]] [[natural transformation|naturality square]]

$$
  \array{
    X &\longrightarrow& \Pi_{inf}(X)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    Y &\longrightarrow& \Pi_{inf}(Y)
  }
$$

is a [[pullback]] square. Then the three properties to be shown are equivalently the [[pasting law]] for pullback diagrams.

=--


+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition


A [[smooth morphism of schemes]] is étale iff there is an [[étale cover]] of the base  scheme by [[open subschemes]] such that the pullback of the projection to each of them is an open local isomorphism of [[locally ringed spaces]] (and in particular, the pullback of the projection morphism is an [[étalé space|étale map]] of the corresponding underlying topological spaces). 

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

This disjointness picture of étale covers make them suitable for having nontrivial [[cohomology]] in situations where Zariski covers give vanishing cohomology.

### Classes of examples

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Let $k$ be a [[field]]. A morphism of [[scheme]]s $Y \to Spec k$ is étale precisely if $Y$ is a [[coproduct]] $Y \simeq \coprod_i Spec k_i$ for each $k_i$ a finite and separable [[field extension]] of $k$.

=--

This appears for instance as [de Jong, prop. 3.1 i)](#deJong). 

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Such étale morphisms are classified by the classical [[Galois theory]] of field extensions.

###### Proposition

A [[ring]] homomorphism of [[affine varieties]] $Spec(A) \to Spec(B)$ for $Spec(B)$ non-singular and for $A \simeq B[x_1, \cdots, x_n]/(f_1, \cdots, f_n)$  with [[polynomials]] $f_i$ is étale precisel if the [[Jacobian]] $det(\frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j})$ is invertible.

This appears for instance as ([Milne, prop. 2.1](#Milne)).




### As locally constant sheaves {#AsLocallyConstantSheaves}

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

A [[sheaf]] $F$ on a scheme $X$ corresponds to an étale morphism $Y \to X$ precisely if there is an [[étale cover]] $\{U_i \to X\}$ such that each restriction

$$
  F|_{U_i} \simeq LConst K_i
$$

is [[isomorphic]] to a [[constant sheaf]] on a [[set]] $K_i$.

=--

A proof is in ([Deligne](#Deligne)).



## Examples
 {#Examples}


+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

A finite separable [[field extension]] $K \hookrightarrow L$ corresponds dually to an étale morphism $Spec L \to Spec K$. These are the morphisms classified by classical [[Galois theory]].

=--

+-- {: .num_example #OpenImmersionIsEtale}
###### Example

Every [[open immersion of schemes]] is an étale morphism of schemes.
In particular a standard open inclusion (a [[cover]] in the [[Zariski topology]]) induced by the [[localization of a commutative ring]]

$$
  Spec(R[S^{-1}]) \longrightarrow Spec(R)
$$

is étale.

=--

(e.g. [[The Stacks Project|Stacks Project, lemma 28.37.9]])

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By one of the equivalent characterizations of [[étale morphism]] it is sufficient to check that the map $Spec(R[S^{-1}]) \longrightarrow Spec(R)$ is a [[formally étale morphism]] and [[locally of finite presentation]].

The latter is clear, since the very definition of 

$$
  R[S^{-1}] = R[s_1^{-1}, \cdots, s_n^{-1}](s_1 s_1^{-1} - 1, \cdots , s_n s_n^{-1} - 1)
$$ 

exhibits a [[finitely presented algebra]] over $R$.

To see that it is formally étale we need to check that for every [[commutative ring]] $T$ with [[nilpotent ideal]] $J$ we have a [[pullback]] diagram

$$
  \array{
    Hom(R[S^{-1}], T) &\longrightarrow& Hom(R[S^{-1}],T/J)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    Hom(R, T) &\longrightarrow& Hom(R, T/J)
  }
  \,.
$$

Now by the [[universal property]] of the [[localization of a commutative ring|localization]], a homomorphism $R[S^{-1}] \longrightarrow T$ is a homomorphism $R \longrightarrow T$ which sends all elements in $S \hookrightarrow R$ to invertible elements in $T$. But no element in a [[nilpotent ideal]] can be invertible, Therefore the fiber product of the bottom and right map is the set of maps from $R$ to $T$ such that $S$ is taken to invertibles, which is indeed the top left set.
