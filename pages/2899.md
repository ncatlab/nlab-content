## Idea

The notion of _étale morphism of schemes_ is the realization of the general notion of [[étale morphism]] for maps between [[schemes]], hence it captures roughly the idea of a map of schemes which is a [[local homeomorphism]]/[[local diffeomorphism]].

A central use of étale morphisms of schemes is that they appear as [[coverings]] in the [[Grothendieck topology]] of the [[étale site]]. The [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] with respect to these étale covers of schemes is accordingly called _[[étale cohomology]]_.



## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn #EquivalentConditionsForEtale}
###### Definition

A [[morphism]] of [[schemes]] is an **étale morphism** if the following equivalent conditions hold:

1. it is

   1. [[smooth morphism of schemes|smooth]] 

   1. [[unramified morphism|unramified]] 

1. it is

   1. [[smooth morphism of schemes|smooth]] 

   1. of [[relative dimension]] $0$. 

1. it is 

   1. [[flat morphism|flat]] 

   1. [[unramified]];

1. it is

   1. [[formally étale morphism of schemes|formally étale]];

   1. [[locally of finite presentation]]

(A number of other equivalent definitions are listed at [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etale_morphism).)

###### Remark

Relaxing the finiteness condition in item 4 of \ref{EquivalentConditionsForEtale} yields the notion of _[[weakly étale morphism]]_.

[[étale morphism of schemes|étale morphism]] $\Rightarrow$ [[pro-étale morphism of schemes|pro-étale morphism]] $\Rightarrow$ [[weakly étale morphism of schemes|weakly étale morphism]] $\Rightarrow$ [[formally étale morphism of schemes|formally étale morphism]]

###### Definition

A jointly surjective collection of étale morphisms $\{U_i \to X\}$ is called an [[étale cover]].

=--


+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Most of the pairs of conditions in def. \ref{EquivalentConditionsForEtale} can be read as constraining the fiber of the morphism to be first suitably surjective/[[bundle]]-like ([[smooth morphism of schemes|smooth]], [[flat morphism|flat]]) and second suitably locally injective ([[unramified]]).

Specifically the first condition has an [[infinitesimal object|infinitesimal anlog]]: a [[formally étale morphism]] is a [[formally smooth morphism|formally smooth]] and [[formally unramified morphism]]. These notions also have an interpretation in [[synthetic differential geometry]] and there they correspond to the statement that a [[local diffeomorphism]] is a [[submersion]] which is also an [[immersion of smooth manifolds]].

###### Definition

A morphism is **[[formally étale morphism]]** if it is 

* [[formally smooth]] (satisfying an infinitesimal lifting property) 

* and [[formally unramified]]. 

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

These are sheaf-like properties, which can be formalized in the language of [[Q-categories]] ([[monopresheaf]] and [[epipresheaf]] properties on the $Q$-category of nilpotent thickenings).

## Properties


### Closure properties

* A [[composite]] of étale morphism is étale.

* The property of being étale is [[base change|preserved under pullbacks]] along any morphism of schemes. 

* A smooth map of schemes is étale iff there is an [[étale cover]] of the base  scheme by [[open subschemes]] such that the pullback of the projection to each of them is an open local isomorphism of [[locally ringed spaces]] (and in particular, the pullback of the projection morphism is an [[étalé space|étale map]] of the corresponding underlying topological spaces). 

  This disjointness picture of étale covers make them suitable for having nontrivial [[cohomology]] in situations where Zariski covers give vanishing cohomology.

### Classes of examples

###### Proposition

Let $k$ be a [[field]]. A morphism of [[scheme]]s $Y \to Spec k$ is étale precisely if $Y$ is a [[coproduct]] $Y \simeq \coprod_i Spec k_i$ for each $k_i$ a finite and separable [[field extension]] of $k$.

This appears for instance as [de Jong, prop. 3.1 i)](#deJong). 

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Such étale morphisms are classified by the classical [[Galois theory]] of field extensions.

###### Proposition

A [[ring]] homomorphism $A \to B$ is étale precisely if  $B \simeq R[x_1, \cdots, x_n]/(f_1, \cdots, f_n)$ where 

* all the $f_i$ are [[polynomial]]s;

* the [[Jacobian]] $det(\frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j})$ is a unit in $S$.

=--

This appears for instance as [de Jong, prop. 3.1 ii)](#deJong).

+-- {: .standout}

This proposition seems to be wrong for 2 reasons; first, A,B,R,S are 2 many symbols. Second, the statement sounds like "etale iff standard smooth" but only the direction "etale implies standard smooth" is true (and can be found in the stacks project). Since I couldn't find the cited source, I couldn't look into what the statement is supposed to be, originally. -- Konrad

### As locally constant sheaves {#AsLocallyConstantSheaves}

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

A [[sheaf]] $F$ on a scheme $X$ corresponds to an étale morphism $Y \to X$ precisely if there is an [[étale cover]] $\{U_i \to X\}$ such that each restriction

$$
  F|_{U_i} \simeq LConst K_i
$$

is [[isomorphic]] to a [[constant sheaf]] on a [[set]] $K_i$.

=--

A proof is in ([Deligne](#Deligne)).



## Examples

* A finite separable [[field extension]] $K \hookrightarrow L$ corresponds dually to an étale morphism $Spec L \to Spec K$. These are the morphisms classified by classical [[Galois theory]].
