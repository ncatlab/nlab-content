This entry is about étale morphisms in the sense of algebraic geometry. Word étale map is preffered in differentiable and topological contexts, see [[etale space]] for the topological version. 

Recall that for a [[smooth morphism of schemes]] $f:X\to Y$ we can define a relative dimension in every point $X$. 
A morphism of [[schemes]] is **étale** if it is a smooth morphism and if it is of relative dimension $0$. Equivalently, it is [[flat morphism|flat]] and unramified. 
Property of being étale is preserved under pullbacks along any morphism of schemes; the composition of étale maps is étale.

There is a weaker notion of a formally étale morphism. A morphism is **formally étale** if it is [[formally smooth]] (satisfying infinitesimal lifting property) and formally unramified. These are sheaf-like properties, what can be formalized in the language of [[Q-categories]] ([[monopresheaf]] and epipresheaf properties on the Q-category of nilpotent thickenings). 

Etale morphisms are used to define small and big étale sites and [[étale cohomology]]. Etale topology has similar cohomological properties to complex analytic topology, and in particular it is much finer for cohomological purposes than the Zariski topology.
