###### Definition

The [[skeleton]] of the [[category]] $FinSet^{*/}$ of [[pointed object|pointed]] [[finite sets]] is often called **Segal's category** and then denoted $\Gamma \in Cat$

$$
  \Gamma \simeq FinSet^{*/}
  \,.
$$

###### Remark

The category $\Gamma$ is related to [[(∞,1)-operads]] in a way similar to how the [[simplex category]] (non-empty and _linearly ordered_  finite sets) is related to [[(∞,1)-categories]].

###### Remark

A morphism $f \colon \{*\} \coprod S \to \{*\} \coprod T$ in $\Gamma$ may be thought of as a [[partially defined function]] $\tilde f \colon S \to T$ which is undefined on all elements of $S$ that $f$ sends to the point.
