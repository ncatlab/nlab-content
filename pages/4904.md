## Idea

For $T$ a [[Lawvere theory]] and $T Alg$ the [[category]] of [[algebra over a Lawvere theory]], there is a [[model category]] structure on the category $T Alg^{\Delta^{op}}$ of [[simplicial object|simplicial]] $T$-algebras which models the $\infty$-algebras for $T$ regarded as an [[(∞,1)-algebraic theory]].

## Details

Recall that the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-presheaves]] $PSh_{(\infty,1)}(C^{op})$ itself is modeled by the [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]]

$$
  PSh_{(\infty,1)}(C^{op})
  \simeq
  [C, sSet]^\circ
  \,,
$$

where we regard $C$ as a [[Kan complex]]-[[enriched category]] and have on the right the [[sSet]]-[[enriched functor category]] with the projective or injective model structure, and $(-)^\circ$ denoting the full enriched subcategory on fibrant-cofibrant objects.

This says in particular that every weak $(\infty,1)$-functor $f : C \to \infty \mathrm{Grp}$ is equivalent to a _rectified_ one $F : C \to KanCplx$. And $f \in PSh_{(\infty,1)}(C^{op})$ belongs to $Alg_{(\infty,1)}(C)$ if $F$ preserves finite products _weakly_  in that for $\{c_i \in C\}$ a finite collection of objects, the canonical natural morphism

$$
  F(c_1 \times \cdots, \c_n)
  \to
  F(c_1) \times \cdots \times F(c_n)
$$ 

is a [[homotopy equivalence]] of [[Kan complex]]es.

We now look at model category structure on _strictly_ product preserving functors $C \to sSet$, which gives an equivalent model for $Alg_{(\infty,1)}(C)$. See [[model structure on homotopy T-algebras]].

###### Proposition
**(first model structure)**

Let $T$ be a [[category]] with [[finite product]], and let $T Alg^{\Delta^{op}} \subset Func(T,sSet)$ be the [[full subcategory]] of the [[functor category]] from $T$ to [[sSet]] on those functors that preserve these products.  

Then $T Alg^{\Delta^{op}}$ carries the structure of a [[model category]] $sAlg(C)_{proj}$ where the weak equivalences and the fibrations are those maps underlying which are weak equivalences or fibrations, respectively, in the [[classical model structure on simplicial sets]]. 

=--

This is due to ([Quillen](#Quillen)).


The inclusion $i : sAlg(C) \hookrightarrow sPSh(C^{op})_{proj}$ into the projective [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] evidently preserves fibrations and acyclic fibrations and gives a [[Quillen adjunction]]

$$
  sAlg(C)_{proj}
  \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\underset{i}{\hookrightarrow}}
  sPSh(C^{op})
  \,.
$$


+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The total right [[derived functor]] 

$$
  \mathbb{R}i : Ho(sAlg(C)_{proj}) \to Ho(sPSh(C^{op})_{proj})
$$ 

is a [[full and faithful functor]] and an object $F \in sPSh(C^{op})$ belongs to the [[essential image]] of $\mathbb{R}i$ precisely if it preserves product up to [[weak homotopy equivalence]].

=--

This is due to ([Bergner](#Bergner)).

It follows that the natural $(\infty,1)$-functor

$$
  (sAlg(C)_{proj})^\circ \stackrel{}{\to}
  PSh_{(\infty,1)}(C^{op})
$$

is an [[equivalence of quasi-categories|equivalence]].

A comprehensive statement of these facts is in [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, section 5.5.9]].

###### Proposition
**(second model structure)**

Let $T$ be the [[Lawvere theory]] for commutative [[associative algebra]]s over a ring $k$. Then $CAlg_k$ becomes a [[simplicial model category]] with

* weak equivalences the morphisms whose underlying morphism of simplicial sets are weak equivalences in the [[classical model structure on simplicial sets]];

* fibrations the morphisms $X \to Y$ such that $X \to \pi_0 X \times_{\pi_0 Y} Y$ is a degreewise surjection.

=--

This appears as ([GoerssSchemmerhorn, theorem 4.17](#GoerssSchemmerhorn)).


## Properties

### Relation to homotopy $T$-algebras

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

There is a [[Quillen equivalence]] between the model structure on simplicial $T$-algebras and the model structure for [[homotopy T-algebra]]s. (See there).

=--

This is theorem 1.3 in ([Badzioch](#Badzioch)).

### Homotopy groups

Let $T$ be an _abelian Lawvere theory_,  a theory that contains the theory of [[abelian group]], $Ab \to T$. Then every simplicial $T$-algebra has an underlying abelian [[simplicial group]] and is necessarily a [[Kan complex]].

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Observation

The [[homotopy group]]s $\pi_*$ of a simplicial abelian $T$-agebra form an $\mathbb{N}$-graded $T$-algebra $\pi_*(A)$

=--

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Observation

The inclusion of the full [[subcategory]] $i : T Alg \hookrightarrow T Alg^{\Delta^{op}}$ of ordinary $T$-algebra as the simplicially constant ones constitutes a [[Quillen adjunction]]

$$
  (\pi_0  \dashv i) : T Alg \stackrel{\overset{\pi_0}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{i}{\hookrightarrow}}
  T Alg^{\Delta^{op}}
$$

from the [[trivial model structure]] on $T Alg$.

The [[derived functor]] $\mathbb{R} i : T Alg \to Ho(T Alg^{\Delta^{op}})$ is a  [[full and faithful functor]].

=--

This allows us to think of ordinary $T$-algebras a sitting inside $\infty$-$T$-algebras.


> all this is certainly true for ordinary $k$-algebras. Need to spell out general proof.


## Examples

### Simplicial ordinary $k$-algebras

A [[simplicial ring]]s is a simplicial $T$-algebras for $T$ the Lawvere theory of rings. 

Let $k$ be an ordinary commutative ring and $T$ the theory of commutative [[associative algebra]]s over $k$. We write $T Alg$ as $sCAlg_k$ or $CAlg_k^{op}$.

Such simplicial $k$-algebras are discussed for instance in ([ToënVezzosi, section 2.2.1](#ToenVezzosi)).
According to ([Schwede 97](#Schwede97), Lemma 3.1.3), this model structure is [[proper model category|proper]].
