## Definition

Let  $A$ be an [[additive category]]. 
Recall the notion of [[chain complex]], of morphisms of chain complexes in $A$, and of [[chain homotopy]].

We have 

* $C(A)$, the category of chain complexes and chain chomplex homomorphisms in $C$;

* $K(A)$, the category obtained from $C(A)$ by identifying homotopic chain homomorphisms.

If $A$ is moreover [[abelian category|abelian]], then we also have

* $D(A)$, the [[derived category]] obtained from $C(A)$ (or $K(A)$) by inverting all [[quasi-isomorphism]]s.
