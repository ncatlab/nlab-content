#Definition#

Let  $A$ be an [[additive category]]. 
Recall the notion of [[chain complex]] and of morphisms of chain compelxes in $A$.

We have 

* $C(A)$, the category of chain complexes and chain chomplex homomorphisms in $C$;

* $K(A)$, the category obtained from $C(A)$ by identifying homotopic chain homomorphisms.
