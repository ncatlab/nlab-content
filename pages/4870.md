## Definitions

Whiskering is  form of [[composition]] which acts on a [[functor]] and a [[natural transformation]] to produce a natural transformation, or more generally on a [[morphism]] and a $2$-[[2-morphism|morphism]] to produce a $2$-morphism.  If we identify a functor or morphism with its [[identity natural transformation]] or [[identity 2-morphism]], then whiskering is a special case of [[horizontal composition]], and composition of morphisms is a special case of whiskering.

In detail:

* If $F,G\colon C \to D$ and $H\colon D\to E$ are functors and $\eta\colon F \to G$ is a natural transformation whose coordinate at any object $A$ of $C$ is $\eta_A$, then __whiskering__ $H$ and $\eta$ yields the natural transformation $H \circ \eta\colon (H \circ F) \to (H \circ G)$ whose coordinate at $A$ is $H(\eta_A)$.
* If $F\colon C \to D$ and $G,H\colon D \to E$ are functors and $\eta\colon G\to H$ is a natural transformation whose coordinate at $A$ is $\eta_A$, then __whiskering__ $\eta$ and $F$ yields the natural transformation $\eta \circ F\colon (G \circ F) \to (H \circ F)$ whose coordinate at $A$ is $\eta_{F(A)}$.
