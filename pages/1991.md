Recall from the discussion at [[models for infinity-stack (infinity,1)-toposes]] that [[simplicial presheaf|simplicial presheaves]] model generalized "$(\infty,1)$-spaces".

In the sence of [[space and quantity]] the [[duality|concrete dual]] notion obtained by homming into objects of the underlying site should be tought of as $(\infty,1)$-quantities.

We call a _model for $(\infty,1)$-quantities_ a category of cosimplicial copresheaves

$$
  [[C,[\Delta, Set]]]
$$

suitably localized.

We have canonically a functor from $(\infty,1)$-spaces to $(\infty,1)$-quantities

$$
  C^\infty(-) : [C^{op}, [\Delta^{op}, Set]]
  \to [C,[\Delta,Set]]
$$

that in each degree sends a presheaf to the [[generalized smooth algebra]] over it  (for $C = $ [[CartSp]]).
