A _stable $(\infty,1)$-topos_ is to an [[(infinity,1)-topos]] as a [[stable (infinity,1)-category]] is to an [[(infinity,1)-category]].

Recall that a Grothendieck-Rezk-Lurie [[(infinity,1)-topos]] is an [[(infinity,1)-category of (infinity,1)-sheaves]], i.e. of [[sheaf|sheaves]] with values in the [[(infinity,1)-category]] of [[infinity-groupoid]]s. 

A _stable_ Grothendieck-Rezk-Lurie [[(infinity,1)-topos]] should therefore be an [[(infinity,1)-category]] of [[sheaf|sheaves]] with values in [[spectrum|spectra]].

But maybe a full formalization of this idea has not appeared yet (?)

[[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: While the general study of sheaves of spectra is certainly an important topic, I'm not sure I agree that they should be called "stable $(\infty,1)$-toposes."  They're not very topos-like; they're much more like, say, [[Ab]].
