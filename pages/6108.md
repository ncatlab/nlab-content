## Idea

Originally, the _Ginzburg-Laundau model_ is a [[model (physics)|model]] in [[solid state physics]] for [[superconductivity]].

Roughly this type of model has then been used as models for 2d [[quantum field theory]] in [[string theory]].
There, a _Landau-Ginzburg model_ (LG-model) is a 2-[[dimension|dimensional]] [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] [[sigma model]] [[QFT]] characterized by the fact that its [[Lagrangian]] contains a potential term: given a [[complex manifold|complex]] [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian]] [[target space]] $(X,g)$, the [[action functional]] of the LG-model is schematically of the form

$$
  S_{LB} : (\phi : \Sigma \to X) \mapsto
  \int_\Sigma \left( \vert (\nabla \Phi \vert^2 + \vert (\nabla W)(\phi) \vert^2 
  + fermionic terms \right) d \mu
  \,,
$$

where $\Sigma$ is the 2-[[dimension]]al [[worldsheet]] and $W : X \to \mathbb{C}$ -- called the model's _superpotential_ -- is a [[holomorphic function]]. (Usually $X$ is actually taken to be a [[Cartesian space]] and all the nontrivial structure is in $W$.)

Landau-Ginzburg models have gained importance as constituting one type of QFTs that are related under [[homological mirror symmetry]]:

If the [[target space]] $X$ is a [[Fano variety]], the usual [[B-model]] does not quite exist on it, since the corresponding supersymmetric [[string]] [[sigma model]] is not conformally invariant as a quantum theory, and the axial $U(1)$ [[R-current]] used to define the B-twist is [[quantum anomaly|anomalous]]. Still, there exists an analogous [[derived category]] of B-branes. A Landau-Ginburg model is something that provides the dual A-branes to this under [[homological mirror symmetry]]. Conversely, Landau-Ginzburg B-branes are homological mirror duals to the [[A-model]] on a Fano variety.
(...)

As suggested by [[Maxim Kontsevich]] (see [Kapustin-Li, section 7](#KapustinLi)), the B-branes in the LG-model (at least in a certain class of cases) are not given by [[chain complexes]] of [[coherent sheaves]] as in the [[B-model]], but by _[[twisted complexes]]_ : for these the square of the [[differential]] is in general non-vanishing and identified with the _superpotential_ of the LG-model.
