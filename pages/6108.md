## Idea

A _Landau-Ginzburg model_ (LG-model) is a 2-[[dimension]]al [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] [[sigma model]] [[QFT]] characterized by the fact that its [[Lagrangian]] contains a potential term: for $(X,g)$ a [[complex manifold|complex]] [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian]] [[target space]], the [[action functional]] of the LG-model is schematically of the form

$$
  S_{LB} : (\phi : \Sigma \to X) \mapsto
  \int_\Sigma \vert (\nabla \Phi \vert^2 + \vert (\nabla W)(\phi) \vert^2 
  + fermionic terms) d \mu
  \,,
$$

where $\Sigma$ is the 2-[[dimension]]al [[worldsheet]] and $W : X \to \mathbb{C}$ -- called the model's _superpotential_ -- is a [[holomorphic function]]. (Usually $X$ is actually taken to be a [[Cartesian space]] and all the nontrivial structure is in $W$.)

Landau-Ginzburg models have gained inmportance as constituing one type of QFTs that are related under [[homological mirror symmetry]]:

For [[target space]] $X$ a [[Fano variety]] the usual [[B-model]] does not quite exist on it, since the corresponding supersymmetric [[string]] [[sigma model]] is not conformally invariant as a quantum theory, and the axial $U(1)$ [[R-current]] used to define the B-twist is [[quantum anomaly|anomalous]]. Still, there exists an anlogous [[derived category]] of B-branes. A Landau-Ginburg model is something that provides the dual A-branes to this under [[homological mirror symmetry]]. Conversely, Landau-Ginzburg B-branes are homological mirror duals to the [[A-model]] on a Fano variety.
(...)

As suggested by [[Maxim Kontsevich]] (see [Kapustin-Li, section 7](#KapustinLi)), the B-branes in the LG-model (at least in a certain class of cases) are not given by [[chain complex]]es of [[coherent sheaves]] as in the [[B-model]], but by _[[twisted complexes]]_ : for these the square of the [[differential]] is in general non-vanishing and identified with the _superpotential_ of the LG-model.
