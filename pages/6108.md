## Idea

The _Landau-Ginzburg model_ (LG-model) is a certain 2-[[dimension]]al [[TQFT]] related to the [[A-model]] and the [[B-model]].

More precisely, for [[target space]] a [[Fano variety]] the usual [[B-model]] does not quite exist, since the corresponding supersymmetric [[string]] [[sigma model]] is not conformally invariant as a quantum theory, and the axial $U(1)$ [[R-current]] used to define the B-twist is [[quantum anomaly|anomalous]]. Still, there exists an anlogous [[derived category]] of B-branes. A Landau-Ginburg model is something that provides the dual A-branes to this under [[homological mirror symmetry]]. Conversely, Landau-Ginzburg B-branes are homological mirror duals to the [[A-model]] on a Fano variety.
(...)

As first duggested by [[Maxim Kontsevich]], the B-branes in the LG-model (at least in a certain class of cases) are not given by [[chain complex]]es of [[coherent sheaves]] as in the [[B-model]], but by _[[twisted complexes]]_ : for these the square of the [[differential]] $d \circ d = [W,-]$ is in general non-vanishing and equal to the commutator with an object called the _superpotential_ of the LG-model. They form a [[curved dg-algebra]].
