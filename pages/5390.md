## Definition

Let $R$ be a (possibly noncommutative associative) [[ring]] (unital or [[rng|not]]). The collection of one sided (say right) [[ideal of a ring|ideals]] has a [[partial order]] with respect to inclusion; a [[filter]] with respect to this partial order is a set of right ideals $F$ such that $R\in F$; if $I$,$J$ are right ideals, $I\in F$ and $I\subset J$ then $J\in F$; and if $I,J\in F$ then $I\cap J\in F$. 

A filter of ideals in $R$ is __topologizing__ if 

1. it is [[uniform filter|uniform]], 
   i.e. for any $I\in F$ and $r\in R$, the right ideal 

   $$
   (I:r) := \{s\in R \,|\, rs\in I\}
   $$

   is in $I$.

2. if $J\in F$ and $(I:r)\in I$ for all $r\in J$ then $I\in F$.


## Properties

The term topologizing is explained by the following statement:

###### Proposition

A topologizing set of right ideals in a ring $R$ is a basis of neighborhoods of $0$ for a topology on $R$.
