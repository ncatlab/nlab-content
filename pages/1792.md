## Idea ##

The suspension $S X$ of a [[topological space]] $X$ is a space of one higher dimension, which is (for [[inhabited set|inhabited]] $X$) a [[quotient object|quotient space]] of $X \times [0,1]$.  The difference between $S X$ and $X \times [0,1]$ is that the copy of $X$ at each endpoint ($0$ or $1$) is replaced by a single point.

Check out [this picture](http://secure.wikimedia.org/commons/wiki/File:Suspension.svg) until such time as I can get Instiki to accept it.  (This shows the suspension of the blue circle as $X$; the green dots correspond to $2$ in the first definition below.)

Note that we *replace* $X$ by a single point at each endpoint; we don\'t merely *identify* all of the points in $X$ there.  This only makes a different for the [[empty space]]; we should have $S \empty = \{\bot,\top\}$, not $S \empty = \empty$.  (This is related to the issues in the definition of [[connected space]].)

Compare the [[reduced suspension]], where you start with a [[pointed space]] and identify all copies of the base point as well.


## Definitions ##

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]]; let $I$ be the unit [[interval]] $[0,1]$ in the [[real line]], and let $2$ be the $2$-point [[discrete space]] $\{\bot,\top\}$.  Let $X \times I \times 2$ be the [[cartesian product]] of $X$, $2$, and $I$; let $X + (X \times 2 \times I) + 2$ be the [[disjoint union]] of $$X$, $X \times I \times 2$ and $2$.  We will suppress reference to the inclusion maps into $(X \times I) + 2$; it will be clear from context how to parse an element of the latter.


The __suspension__ $S X$ of $X$ is the [[quotient space]] of $X + (X \times I \times 2) + 2$ by the [[equivalence relation]] $\sim$ generated by:

*  $a \sim (a,0,\bot)$ for $a$ in $X$;
*  $a \sim (a,0,\top)$ for $a$ in $X$;
*  $(a,1,\bot) \sim \bot$ for $a$ in $X$;
*  $(a,1,\top) \sim \top$ for $a$ in $X$.


This generalises immediately to an operation called the __join__ $X \star Y$ of two spaces $X$ and $Y$; this is the quotient space of $X + (X \times I \times Y) + Y$ by the equivalence relation generated by:

*  $a \sim (a,0,b)$ for $a$ in $X$ and $b$ in $Y$;
*  $(a,1,b) \sim b$ for $a$ in $X$ and $b$ in $Y$.

Then we have $S X = X \star 2$.


It is somewhat simpler to define $S X$ as the quotient space of $(X \times I) + 2$ by the equivalence relation generated by:

*  $(a,0) \sim \bot$ for $a$ in $X$;
*  $(a,1) \sim \top$ for $a$ in $X$.

This works to define a topological space, but it does not directly give the smooth structure (when working in a category of [[generalized smooth spaces]]) that matches the picture above.


If $X$ has a point $p$, then we can define $S X$ as the quotient space of $X \times I$ by the equivalence relation generated by:

*  $(a,0) \sim (b,0)$ for $a, b$ in $X$;
*  $(a,1) \sim (b,1)$ for $a, b$ in $X$.

This is probably the most common definition seen, but it gives only the topological structure and only for $X$ an inhabited space.


It\'s easy to see that the suspension operation $S$ extends a [[functor]] from [[Top]] to itself.


## Examples ##

The suspension of the $n$-[[cube]] is the $(n+1)$-cube, probably best visualised as a diamond.  This gives a [[recursion|recursive]] definition of cube, starting with the $0$-cube as the [[point]], which is not the suspension of anything.  Note that this not only gives us the topological structure of the cube, but also (by working in an appropriate category throughout) the correct smooth structure on the cube as a [[manifold]] with corners and even the correct [[metric space|metric]] on the cube (if normalised to have diagonals of length $1$).

Up to topological structure, the suspension of the $n$-[[sphere]] is the $(n+1)$-sphere; note that the $n$-sphere is (topologically) the boundary of the $(n+1)$-cube.  The coincidence that 'sphere' and 'suspension' both begin with 's' has not been ignored; we can write $S^n \cong S^n(2)$, where $S^n$ on the left is the $n$-sphere and $S^n$ on the right is the $n$-fold [[composite]] of the suspension functor.  Actually, you should start with the $(-1)$-sphere as the [[empty space]], which is not the suspension of anything; then the $0$-sphere is $S \empty = 2$.  However, this does not give the correct smooth structure on the sphere (unless perhaps there is some more sophisticated definition that fixes this); it might be more appropriate to say that the suspension of the $n$-[[globe]] is the $(n+1)$-globe.

Up to topological structure, the suspension of the $n$-[[simplex]] is the $(n+1)$-simplex, but now this is not very useful.  To study simplices, you should use the __cone__ functor instead, which is $\Lambda X = X \star 1$, where $1$ is the [[point]].

Here is [Chapter 1](http://www.math.psu.edu/katok_a/TOPOLOGY/Chapter1.pdf) (pdf) of a textbook that knows that $S \empty = 2$, although even it regards this as an exception.
