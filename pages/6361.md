## Idea

A _classical state_ is a [[state]] of a [[system of classical mechanics]]. 

## Definition

For $A$ a commutative unital [[associative algebra]] that encodes a [[system of classical mechanics]] (the associative algebra underlying a [[Poisson algebra]]), a **classical state** is an $\mathbb{R}$-[[linear function]]

$$
  \rho : A \to \mathbb{R}
$$ 

that satisfies

* **normalization** $\rho(1) = 1$;

* **positivity** for all $a \in A$ we have $\rho(a a ) \geq 0$.

This is essentially the definition of [[quantum state]], but formulate for commutative and and over the [[real number]]s
