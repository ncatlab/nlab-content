## Definition

A [[topological space]] $X$ is **weakly Hausdorff** (or weak Hausdorff) if for any [[compact Hausdorff space]] $K$ and every [[continuous map]] $f\colon K\to X$, the [[image]] $f(K)$ is [[closed subspace|closed]]. Every weakly Hausdorff space is $T_1$ (that is every point is closed), and every [[Hausdorff space]] is weakly Hausdorff. For the most common purposes for which Hausdorff spaces are used, the assumption of being weakly Hausdorff suffices.  See also [[compactly generated space]].

We have given the definition for topological spaces, but it also makes sense as stated for [[locales]].  Where these overlap ([[sober spaces]] and [[topological locales]]), they agree given the [[ultrafilter theorem]] (which implies that all compact Hausdorff spaces/locales are sober/topological).
