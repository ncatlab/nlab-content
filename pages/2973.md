A [[topological space]] $X$ is **weakly Hausdorff** (or weak Hausdorff) if for any [[compact space|compact]] [[Hausdorff space]] $K$, and a [[continuous map]] $f:K\to X$, the image $f(K)$ is closed. Every weakly Hausdorff space is $T_1$ (that is every point is closed), and every Hausdorff space is weakly Hausdorff. For most common purposes for which Hausdorff spaces are used, the assumption of being weakly Hausdorff suffice.
