## Idea

For $G$ a [[topological group]] [[action|acting]] on a [[topological space]] $X$, its _Borel construction_ or _Borel space_ is another topological space $X \times_G E G$, also known as the [[homotopy quotient]]. In many cases, its ordinary [[cohomology]] is the $G$-[[equivariant cohomology]] of $X$.

## Definition

For $X$ a [[topological space]], $G$ a [[topological group]] and $\rho\colon G \times X \to X$ a [[continuous map|continuous]] $G$-[[action]] (a [[topological G-space]]), the **Borel construction** of $\rho$ is [[generalized the|the]] [[topological space]] $X \times_G E G$, hence [[quotient]] of the [[product]] of $X$ with the total space of [[generalized the|the]] $G$-[[universal principal bundle]] $E G$ by the [[diagonal]] [[action]] of $G$ on both.

Analogously, for $\mathcal{G}$ a [[simplicial group]] and $\mathcal{G} \times X \xrightarrow{\;\;} X$ a [[simplicial group action]], its Borel construction is the [[quotient]]

\[
  \label{BorelConstructionInSimplicialSets}
  \frac
  { W \mathcal{G}  \times X}
  {\mathcal{G}}
  \;\;\;
  \in
  \;\;
  SimplicialSets
\]

of the [[Cartesian product]] of $X$ with the [[universal principal simplicial complex]] $W \mathcal{G}$ by the [[diagonal action]] of $\mathcal{G}$ on these.


## Properties

### Homotopy-theoretic properties
 {#ModelCategoryTheoreticProperties}

#### In simplicial sets

\begin{prop}\label{BorelConstructionIsRightQuillenFunctor}
  The simplicial Borel construction (eq:BorelConstructionInSimplicialSets) is a [[right Quillen functor]] in a [[Quillen equivalence]]

$$
  \big(
    W \mathcal{G} \times (-)
  \big)
  \;\;
  \colon
  \;\;
  \mathcal{G}Actions(sSet)_{proj}
  \xrightarrow{\;\;\;}
  \big(sSet_{Qu}\big)_{\overline W \mathcal{G}}
$$
from the projective [[model structure on simplicial group actions]] to the [[slice model structure]] of the [[classical model structure on simplicial sets]] over the [[simplicial classifying space]] of $\mathcal{G}$.
\end{prop}

([DDK 80, Prop. 2.3, Prop. 2.4](#DDK80), see at *[[Borel model structure]]* for more)

As an example:

\begin{example}\label{ProjectionToSimplicialClassifyingSpaceIsKanFibration}
  If the underlying simplicial set $X \in sSet$ is a [[Kan complex]],
  then the quotient projection from the Borel construction (eq:BorelConstructionInSimplicialSets) to the [[simplicial classifying space]] is a [[Kan fibration]]
  $$
    \big(
      W\mathcal{G} \times X
    \big)
    \big/
    \mathcal{G}
    \xrightarrow{\in Fib} 
    \overline{W}\mathcal{G}
    \,,
  $$

This follows because the morphism is the image of the terminal morphism $X \xrightarrow{\;} \ast$ under the [[right Quillen functor]] from Prop. \ref{BorelConstructionIsRightQuillenFunctor}, hence is a fibration if $X \to \ast$ is.
\end{example}
For generalization of this statement to [[simplicial presheaves]] see [NSS 12b, Thm. 3.91](#NSS12b).

#### In topological spaces
 {#HomotopyPropertiesInTopologicalSpaces}

In the following, we write $TopSp$ for the [[convenient category of topological spaces|convenient category]] of [[compactly generated weak Hausdorff spaces]].

Let 

* $G \,\in\, Grp(TopSp)$ be a [[topological group]] which is [well-pointed](simplicial+topological+group#WellPointedSimplicialTopologicalGroup) in that the inclusion of the [[neutral element]] is a [[Hurewicz cofibration]] [hence](Hurewicz+cofibration#HurewiczCofibrationsInCGWHSpacesAreClosed) a [[closed cofibration]].

* $X \,\in\, G Act(TopSp)$ be a ([[compactly generated weak Hausdorff space|cgwh]])-[[topological G-space]].

\begin{prop}\label{HomotopyFiberSequenceofTopologicalBorelConstruction}
The topological [[Borel construction]] $(X \times E G)/G$ fits into a [[homotopy fiber sequence]] of the form

\[
  \label{HomotopyFiberSequenceOfTopologicalBorelConstruction}
  X 
    \xrightarrow{\;\;} 
  \frac{ 
    X \times EG
  }{
    G
  } 
    \xrightarrow{\;\;}
  B G
  \,.
\]
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  The sequence (eq:HomotopyFiberSequenceOfTopologicalBorelConstruction) is the image under [[geometric realization of simplicial topological spaces]] of the sequence of [[simplicial topological spaces]]

\[
  \label{TopologiCALBorelConstructionFiberSequenceLevelOfSimplicialSpaces}
  const(X)_\bullet
    \xrightarrow{\;\;\;}
  X \times G^{\times^\bullet}
    \xrightarrow{\;\;\;}
  G^{\times^\bullet}
\]

which, in turn, is the image under passage to [[nerves]] of the sequence of [[topological groupoids]]

$$
  (X \rightrightarrows X)
    \xrightarrow{\;\;}
  (X \times G \rightrightarrows X)
    \xrightarrow{\;\;}
  (G \rightrightarrows \ast)
  \,,
$$

with the [[action groupoid]] in the middle and the [[delooping groupoid]] on the right.

Therefore, by the general respect of geometric realization for homotopy fiber products ([this Prop.](geometric+realization+of+simplicial+topological+spaces#SufficientConditionsForRealizationToPreserveHomotopyPullback)) it is now sufficient to observe that

1. the simplicial topological spaces appearing in (eq:TopologiCALBorelConstructionFiberSequenceLevelOfSimplicialSpaces) are all [[good simplicial topological space|good]] (so that their geometric realization models their [[homotopy colimit]]);

1. the sequence (eq:TopologiCALBorelConstructionFiberSequenceLevelOfSimplicialSpaces) of simplicial topological spaces is degreewise a homotopy fiber sequence of topological spaces;

1. the morphism $X \times G^{\times^\bullet} \to G^{\times^\bullet}$ is a [[homotopy Kan fibration]] (see [here](geometric+realization+of+simplicial+topological+spaces#eq:HomotopyTheoreticKanFibration)).

For the first condition observe that the degeneracy maps of the [[nerve]] of an  [[action groupoid]] are all of the form $X \times G^{n} \times ( \{e\} \xhookrightarrow{\;} G)$, hence are closed cofibrations (by [this Example](Hurewicz+cofibration#KifiedProductsOfCofibrationsWithCompactlyGeneratedSpaces)).

For the second condition, observe  that [[projections]] $X \times G^n \to G^n$ are evidently [[Serre fibrations]] whose ordinary [[fiber]] is $X$, so that $X \to X \times G^n \to G^n$ is a [[homotopy fiber sequence]] (by [this Prop.](homotopy+pullback#HomotopyPullbackByOrdinaryPullback)).

For the third point, notice that in the present case the horn-filling map [here](geometric+realization+of+simplicial+topological+spaces#eq:HomotopyTheoreticKanFibration) are all [[isomorphisms]], hence certainly surjective on connected components.
\end{proof}


\begin{prop}\label{TopologicalBorelConstructionOnPrincipalBundles}
**(Borel construction on principal bundle is equivalent to plain quotient)**
\linebreak
Assume that:

* $G$ and $X$ are both [[connected topological space|connected]], $\pi_0 = \ast$; 

* the [[coprojection]] $X \xrightarrow{\;q\;} X/G$ is a [[locally trivial bundle|locally trivial]] $G$-[[fiber bundle]] (hence a $G$-[[principal bundle]]), 

then the topological Borel construction is [[weak homotopy equivalence|weakly homotopy equivalent]] to the plain [[quotient space]]:
$$
  (X \times E G)/G
  \xrightarrow{ \in \,\mathrm{W}_{whe} }
  X/G
  \,.
$$
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
We need to show that the comparison morphism induces an [[isomorphisms]] on all [[homotopy groups]] $\pi_n$.

For $n = 0$ this is immediate, as passage to [[connected components]] is a [[coequalizer]] ([here](connected+space#eq:ConnectedComponentsAsCoequalizer)) and using that [[colimits commute with colimits]]. This implies that both $\pi_0(X/G)$ as well as $\pi_0\big( (X \times E G) / G\big)$ are the [[singleton set]] (by the assumption that $X$ is connected and since $E G$ is connected) and hence are isomorphic.

In order to compare the remaining higher [[homotopy groups]], 
observe that, under the given assumption, with $X \to X/G$ also the coprojection $X \times E G \xrightarrow{ \;\; } (X \times E G)/G$ to the Borel construction itself is a locally trivial fiber bundle: 
Namely from this [[commuting diagram]]

\begin{tikzcd}
    &[-28pt]
    G
    \ar[
      rr,-,
      shift left=1pt
    ] 
    \ar[
      rr,-,
      shift right=1pt
    ]
    \ar[d]
    &&
    G
    \ar[
      d,
      "g \,\mapsto\, g \cdot x_0"
    ]
    &[-28pt]
    \\
    (U \times G) \times EG
    \ar[
      r,
      phantom,
      "\subset"
    ]
    \ar[
      d,
      "{
        \big(\mathrm{pr_1}, (g,p) \mapsto g \cdot p \big)
      }"
    ]
    &
    {X} \times E G
    \ar[
      rr,
      "\mathrm{pr}_1"{above},
      "\in \, \mathrm{W}"{below}
    ]
    \ar[d]
    &&
    {X}
    \ar[
      d,
      "q"
    ]
    \ar[
      r,
      phantom,
      "\supset"
    ]
    &
      {U} \times G
      \ar[
        d,
        "\mathrm{pr}_1"
      ]
    \\
    U \times E G
    \ar[
      r,
      phantom,
      "\subset"
    ]
    &
    ({X} \times E G) / G
    \ar[
      rr,
      "\mathrm{pr}_1/G"
    ]
    &&
    {X}/G
    \ar[
      r,
      phantom,
      "\supset"
    ]
    &
    U
\end{tikzcd}

one sees that for $\big\{ U_i \subset X/G\big\}_{i \in I}$ an [[open cover]] of $X/G$ over which $X \to X/G$ trivializes, we have that 
$\big\{  U_i \times E G \,\subset\, (X \times E G)/G \}_{i \in I}$ is an open cover over which the quotient coprojection into the Borel construction  trivializes.

But since locally trivial bundles are [[Serre fibrations]] ([this Prop.](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Serre+fibration#FiberBundlesAreSerreFibrations)), it follows that the above diagram is a morphism of [[homotopy fiber sequences]] (by [this Prop.](homotopy+pullback#HomotopyPullbackByOrdinaryPullback)), 
and hence induces a morphism of [[long exact sequences of homotopy groups]], which contains the following segments, for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$:

\begin{tikzcd}
    \pi_{n+1}(G)
    \ar[r]
    \ar[
      d,
      "{ \sim }"{yshift=-4pt, xshift=-3pt, sloped}
    ]
    &
    \pi_{n+1}
    \big(
      X \times E G
    \big)
    \ar[r]
    \ar[
      d,
      "{ \sim }"{yshift=-4pt, xshift=-3pt, sloped}
    ]
    &
    \pi_{n+1}
    \big(
      (X \times E G)/G
    \big)
    \ar[r]
    \ar[d]
    &
    \pi_n(G)
    \ar[r]
    \ar[
      d,
      "{ \sim }"{yshift=-4pt, xshift=-3pt, sloped}
    ]
    &
    \pi_n
    \big(
      X \times E G
    \big)
    \ar[
      d,
      "{ \sim }"{yshift=-4pt, xshift=-3pt, sloped}
    ]
    \\
    \pi_{n+1}(G)
    \ar[r]
    &
    \pi_{n+1}(X)
    \ar[r]
    &
    \pi_{n+1}
    \big(
      X/G
    \big)
    \ar[r]
    &
    \pi_n(G)
    \ar[r]
    &
    \pi_n
    \big(
      X
    \big)
\end{tikzcd}

Here the outer vertical morphisms are all [[isomorphisms]] by the fact that $E G \xrightarrow{\;} \ast$ is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]]. Therefore the [[five lemma]] (in its generality of possibly non-abelian groups, [here](five+lemma#FiveLemmaForNonabelianGroups)) implies that also the middle vertical morphism is an isomorphism, for all $n$.
\end{proof}

### As the realization of the action groupoid

This Borel construction is naturally understood as being the [[geometric realization of simplicial topological spaces|geometric realization]] of the [[topological groupoid|topological]] [[action groupoid]] $X // G$ of the [[action]] of $G$ on $X$:

the [[nerve]] of this topological groupoid is the [[simplicial topological space]]

$$
  (X \sslash G)_\bullet =
  \left(
 \cdots X \times G \times G \stackrel{\to}{\stackrel{\to}{\to}} X \times G \stackrel{\overset{\rho}{\to}}{\underset{p_1}{\to}} X
  \right)
  \,.
$$ 

Observing that $E G = G \sslash G$ itself as a groupoid has the nerve

$$
  (E G)_\bullet
   = 
   \left(
   \cdots 
   G \times G \times G 
     \stackrel{\to}{\stackrel{\to}{\to}}
   G \times G \stackrel{\overset{\cdot}{\to}}{\underset{p_1}{\to}} G
  \right)
$$

(where "$\cdot$" denotes the multiplication action of $G$ on itself) and regarding $X$ and $G$ as topological 0-groupoids ($G$ as a group object in topological 0-groupoids), hence with simplicially constant nerves, we have an [[isomorphism]] of simplicial topological spaces

$$
  (X //G)_\bullet 
    \simeq_{iso}
  X \times_G (E G)_\bullet
  \,.
$$

If this is set up in a sufficiently nice category of topological spaces, then, by the discussion at [[geometric realization of simplicial topological spaces]], the geometric realization ${\vert{-}\vert}\colon Top^{\Delta^{op}} \to Top$ manifestly takes this to the Borel construction (since, by the discussion there, it preserves the product and the quotient).

### As a homotopy colimit over the category associated to $G$

If $G$ is the topological category associated to the group $G$, then a $G$-space is precisely a Top-enriched functor $G\to Top$ in a similar fashion to the fact that an  R-module is an Ab-enriched functor. If $X$ is a $G$-space, the ordinary quotient $X/G$ is the colimit of the diagram associated to $X$ and the Borel construction is (a model of) the homotopy colimit of that diagram. This is a reason for calling the Borel construction homotopy quotient in some contexts.

### In rational homotopy theory

The image of the Borel construction in [[rational homotopy theory]] is the [[Weil model]] for [[equivariant de Rham cohomology]]. See there for more.
