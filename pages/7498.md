## Idea

For $G$ a [[topological group]] [[action|acting]] on a [[topological space]] $X$, its _Borel construction_ or _Borel space_ is another topological space $X \times_G E G$, also known as the [[homotopy quotient]]. In many cases, its ordinary [[cohomology]] is the $G$-[[equivariant cohomology]] of $X$.

## Definition

For $X$ a [[topological space]], $G$ a [[topological group]] and $\rho\colon G \times X \to X$ a [[continuous map|continuous]] $G$-[[action]], the **Borel construction** of $\rho$ is [[generalized the|the]] [[topological space]] $X \times_G E G$, hence [[quotient]] of the [[product]] of $X$ with the total space of [[generalized the|the]] $G$-[[universal principal bundle]] $E G$ by the [[diagonal]] [[action]] of $G$ on both.



## Properties

### As the realization of the action groupoid

This Borel construction is naturally understood as being the [[geometric realization of simplicial topological spaces|geometric realization]] of the [[topological groupoid|topological]] [[action groupoid]] $X // G$ of the [[action]] of $G$ on $X$:

the [[nerve]] of this topological groupoid is the [[simplicial topological space]]

$$
  (X // G)_\bullet =
  \left(
 \cdots X \times G \times G \stackrel{\to}{\stackrel{\to}{\to}} X \times G \stackrel{\overset{\rho}{\to}}{\underset{p_1}{\to}} X
  \right)
  \,.
$$ 

Observing that $E G = G//G$ itself as a groupoid has the nerve

$$
  (E G)_\bullet
   = 
   \left(
   \cdots 
   G \times G \times G 
     \stackrel{\to}{\stackrel{\to}{\to}}
   G \times G \stackrel{\overset{\cdot}{\to}}{\underset{p_1}{\to}} G
  \right)
$$

(where "$\cdot$" denotes the multiplication action of $G$ on itself) and regarding $X$ and $G$ as topological 0-groupoids ($G$ as a group object in topological 0-groupoids), hence with simplicially constant nerves, we have an [[isomorphism]] of simplicial topological spaces

$$
  (X //G)_\bullet 
    \simeq_{iso}
  X \times_G (E G)_\bullet
  \,.
$$

If this is set up in a sufficiently nice category of topological spaces, then, by the discussion at [[geometric realization of simplicial topological spaces]], the geometric realization ${\vert{-}\vert}\colon Top^{\Delta^{op}} \to Top$ manifestly takes this to the Borel construction (since, by the discussion there, it preserves the product and the quotient).

### As a homotopy colimit over the category associated to $G$

If $G$ is the topological category associated to the group $G$, then a $G$-space is precisely a Top-enriched functor $G\to Top$ in a similar fashion to the fact that an  R-module is an Ab-enriched functor. If $X$ is a $G$-space, the ordinary quotient $X/G$ is the colimit of the diagram associated to $X$ and the Borel construction is (a model of) the homotopy colimit of that diagram. This is a reason for calling the Borel construction homotopy quotient in some contexts.
