## Idea

For $X$ a [[topological space]], $G$ a [[topological group]] and $\rho : G \times X \to X$ a [[continuous map|continuous]] $G$-[[action]], the **Borel construction** of $\rho$ is [[generalized the|the]] [[topological space]] $X \times_G E G$, hence [[quotient]] of the [[product]] of $X$ with the total space of [[generalized the|the]] $G$-[[universal principal bundle]] $E G$ by the [[diagonal]] [[action]] of $G$ on both.

This space is naturally understood as being the [[geometric realization of simplicial topological spaces|geometric realization]] of the [[topological groupoid|topological]] [[action groupoid]] $X // G$ of the action:

the [[nerve]] of this topological groupoid is the [[simplicial topological space]]

$$
  (X // G)_\bullet =
  \left(
 \cdots X \times G \times G \stackrel{\to}{\stackrel{\to}{\to}} X \times G \stackrel{\overset{\rho}{\to}}{\underset{p_1}{\to}} X
  \right)
  \,.
$$ 

Observing that $E G$ itself as a groupoid has the nerve

$$
  (E G)_\bullet
   = 
   \left(
   \cdots 
   G \times G \times G 
     \stackrel{\to}{\stackrel{\to}{\to}}
   G \times G \stackrel{\to}{\to} G
  \right)
$$

and regarding $X$ and $G$ as topological 0-groupoids, hence with simplicially constant nerves, we have

$$
  (X //G)_\bullet 
    \simeq_{iso}
  X \times_G (E G)_\bullet
  \,.
$$

If this is set up in a sufficiently nice category of topological spaces, then, by the discussion at [[geometric realization of simplicial topological spaces]], the geometric realization ${\vert -\vert} : Top^{\Delta^{op}} \to Top$ manifestly takes this to the Borel construction.
