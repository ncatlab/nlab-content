## Definition

For a [[cohomology theory]] $E$ with [[cohomology group]]s $E(X)$ the **reduced cohomology** of $E$ for [[pointed object|pointed]] [[topological space]]s $X$ is on $X$ the [[kernel]] 

$$
  E_{red}(X) := ker\left(E({*} \to X) : E(X) \to E(*)\right)
$$

of the map $E(X) \to E({*})$ induced from the point inclusion ${*} \to X$.
