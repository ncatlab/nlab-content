## Idea

_Exact couples_ are a tool for constructing [[spectral sequences]].

### Exact couples

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition


Given an [[abelian category]] $\mathcal{C}$, an **[[exact couple]]** in $\mathcal{C}$ is a cyclic [[exact sequence]] of three [[morphisms]] among two [[objects]] of the form

$$ 
  \cdots \stackrel{k}{\to} E \overset{j}{\to} D \overset{\varphi}{\to} D \overset{k}{\to} E \overset{j}{\to} \cdots 
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

This being cyclic, it is usually depicted as a triangle

$$
  \array{
    D && \stackrel{\varphi}{\longrightarrow} && D
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{j}}\nwarrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{k}}
    \\
    && 
    E
  }
$$

The archetypical example from which this and the following definition draw their meaning is the following.

###### Example

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]] or [[chain complex]] or [[spectrum]] or similar, and assume that it is equipped with a resolution of the form

$$
  \array{
    X = X_0 &\stackrel{g_0}{\leftarrow}&  X_1 &\stackrel{g_1}{\leftarrow}& X_2 &\stackrel{g_2}{\leftarrow}& X_3 &\stackrel{}{\leftarrow}& \cdots
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f_0}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f_1}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f_2}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f_3}} &&
    \\
    K_0 && K_1 && K_2 && K_3
  }
$$

where each hook is a [[fiber sequence]]. Then the induced [[long exact sequences of homotopy groups]]

$$
  \cdots
  \pi_\bullet(X_{s+1}) 
  \longrightarrow
  \pi_\bullet(X_s)
  \longrightarrow
  \pi_\bullet(K_s)
  \longrightarrow
  \cdots
$$

for all $s$ give an exact couple by taking $E$ and $D$ to be the [[bigraded object|bigraded]] [[abelian groups]]

$$
  D \coloneqq \pi_\bullet(X_\bullet)
$$

$$
  E \coloneqq \pi_\bullet(K_\bullet)
  \,.
$$

and taking $\phi$ and $k$ to be given by the [[functor|functoriality]] of the [[homotopy groups]] $\pi_{\bullet}$ and finally taking $j$ to be given by the [[connecting homomorphism]]. 

For instance for the original [[diagram]] an [[Adams resolution]] then this [[spectral sequence]] is the [[Adams spectral sequence]].

### Spectral sequences from exact couples

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

The [[spectral sequences]] induced by an exact couple is the one built by repeating the  following two-step process:

*  first, observe that the composite $d=k j \colon E\to E$ is nilpotent: $d^2=0$

*  second, the homology $E'$ of $(E,d)$ supports a map $j':E'\to \varphi D$, and receives a map $k':\varphi D\to E'$.  Setting $D'=\varphi D$, by general properties
$$ E' \overset{j'}{\to} D' \overset{\varphi}{\to} D' \overset{k'}{\to} E' \overset{j'}{\to}. $$
is again an exact couple, called the _derived exact couple_.

The sequence of complexes $(E,d),(E',d'),\dots$ obtained this way is then a [[spectral sequence]], by construction. This is the spectral sequence induced by the exact couple.

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

The exact couple recipe for spectral sequences is notable in that it doesn't mention any grading on the objects $D,E$; trivially, an exact couple can be specified by a short exact sequence $\coker \varphi\to E\to \ker\varphi$, although this obscures the focus usually given to $E$.  In applications, a bi-grading is usually induced by the context, which also specifies bidegrees for the initial maps $j,k,\varphi$, leading to the conventions mentioned earlier.

## Examples

Examples of exact couples can be constructed in a number of ways.  Importantly, any short exact sequence involving two distinct chain complexes provides an exact couple among their total homology complexes, via the 
[[Mayer-Vietoris long exact sequence]]; in particular, applying this procedure to the relative homology of a filtered complex gives precisely the [[spectral sequence of a filtered complex]].  

For another example, choosing a chain complex of flat modules $(C^\dot,d)$, tensoring with the short exact sequence
$$ \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}/p^2\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z} $$
gives the exact couple

$$ 
  H^\bullet(d,\mathbb{Z}/p^2\mathbb{Z})
    \overset{[\cdot]}{\to} 
  H^\bullet(d,\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})
   \overset{\beta}{\to}
  H^\bullet(d,\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})
   \overset{p}{\to}H^\bullet(d,\mathbb{Z}/p^2\mathbb{Z})\cdots
$$

in which $\beta$ is the _mod-$p$ Bockstein_ homomorphism.
