## Idea

_Exact couples_ are a way to encode data that makes a [[spectral sequence]], specially adapted to the case that the underlying filtering along which the spectral sequence proceeds is induced from a tower of [[homotopy fibers]], such as a [[Postnikov tower]] or [[Adams tower]] (see also at _[[Adams spectral sequence]]_).
 
## Definition

### Exact couples

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition


Given an [[abelian category]] $\mathcal{C}$, an **[[exact couple]]** in $\mathcal{C}$ is a cyclic [[exact sequence]] of three [[morphisms]] among two [[objects]] of the form

$$ 
  \cdots \stackrel{k}{\longrightarrow} E \overset{j}{\to} D \overset{\varphi}{\longrightarrow} D \overset{k}{\to} E \overset{j}{\longrightarrow} \cdots 
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

This being cyclic, it is usually depicted as a triangle

$$
  \array{
    D && \stackrel{\varphi}{\longrightarrow} && D
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{j}}\nwarrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{k}}
    \\
    && 
    E
  }
$$

The archetypical example from which this and the following definition draw their meaning is example \ref{ExactCoupleOfATower} below.


### Spectral sequences from exact couples
 {#SpectralSequencesFromExactCouples}

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

The [[spectral sequences]] induced by an exact couple is the one built by repeating the  following two-step process:

*  first, observe that the composite $d=k j \colon E\to E$ is nilpotent: $d^2=0$

*  second, the homology $E'$ of $(E,d)$ supports a map $j':E'\to \varphi D$, and receives a map $k':\varphi D\to E'$.  Setting $D'=\varphi D$, by general properties
$$ E' \overset{j'}{\to} D' \overset{\varphi}{\to} D' \overset{k'}{\to} E' \overset{j'}{\to}. $$
is again an exact couple, called the _derived exact couple_.

The sequence of complexes $(E,d),(E',d'),\dots$ obtained this way is then a [[spectral sequence]], by construction. This is the spectral sequence induced by the exact couple.

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

The exact couple recipe for spectral sequences is notable in that it doesn't mention any grading on the objects $D,E$; trivially, an exact couple can be specified by a short exact sequence $\coker \varphi\to E\to \ker\varphi$, although this obscures the focus usually given to $E$.  In applications, a bi-grading is usually induced by the context, which also specifies bidegrees for the initial maps $j,k,\varphi$, leading to the conventions mentioned earlier.

## Examples

+-- {: .num_example #ExactCoupleOfATower}
###### Example

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]] or [[chain complex]] or [[spectrum]] or similar, and assume that it is equipped with a resolution of the form

$$
  \array{
    X & =&  X_0 &\stackrel{g_0}{\leftarrow}&  X_1 &\stackrel{g_1}{\leftarrow}& X_2 &\stackrel{g_2}{\leftarrow}& X_3 &\stackrel{}{\leftarrow}& \cdots
    \\
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f_0}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f_1}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f_2}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f_3}} &&
    \\
    && K_0 && K_1 && K_2 && K_3
  }
$$

where each hook is a [[fiber sequence]] (e.g. a [[Postnikov tower]] or [[Adams tower]]). Then the induced [[long exact sequences of homotopy groups]]

$$
  \cdots
  \pi_\bullet(X_{s+1}) 
  \longrightarrow
  \pi_\bullet(X_s)
  \longrightarrow
  \pi_\bullet(K_s)
  \longrightarrow
  \cdots
$$

for all $s$ give an exact couple by taking $E$ and $D$ to be the [[bigraded object|bigraded]] [[abelian groups]]

$$
  D \coloneqq \pi_\bullet(X_\bullet)
$$

$$
  E \coloneqq \pi_\bullet(K_\bullet)
  \,.
$$

and taking $\phi$ and $k$ to be given by the [[functor|functoriality]] of the [[homotopy groups]] $\pi_{\bullet}$ and finally taking $j$ to be given by the [[connecting homomorphism]]. 

For instance for the original [[diagram]] an [[Adams resolution]] then this [[spectral sequence]] is the [[Adams spectral sequence]].

+-- {: .num_example }
###### Example

Any [[short exact sequence]] of [[chain complexes]] induces an exact couple among their total homology complexes, via the 
[[Mayer-Vietoris long exact sequence]].

In particular, applying this procedure to the relative homology of a [[filtered complex]] gives precisely the [[spectral sequence of a filtered complex]].  

=--

+-- {: .num_example }
###### Example


Given a [[chain complex]] of [[flat modules]] $(C^\dot,d)$, [[tensor product of modules|tensoring]] with the [[short exact sequence]]

$$ 
   \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}/p^2\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z} 

$$

gives the exact couple

$$ 
  H^\bullet(d,\mathbb{Z}/p^2\mathbb{Z})
    \overset{[\cdot]}{\to} 
  H^\bullet(d,\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})
   \overset{\beta}{\to}
  H^\bullet(d,\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})
   \overset{p}{\to}H^\bullet(d,\mathbb{Z}/p^2\mathbb{Z})\cdots
$$

in which $\beta$ is the _mod-$p$ [[Bockstein homomorphism]]_.
