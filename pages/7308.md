## Idea

The notion of _[[operad]]_ comes in two broad flavors (apart from the choice of enriching category): _planar operads_ and _[[symmetric operads]]_. Accordingly, planar operads are also called _non-symmetric operads_. Another term is _nonpermutative operads_.

A planar operad is a collection ([[set]]/[[object]] in some enriching category) of $n$-ary operations for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, equipped with a suitable notion of _composition_. In contrast, a _[[symmetric operad]]_ in addition carries an [[action]] of the [[symmetric group]] $\Sigma_n$ on the object on $n$-ary operations, and all structures are required to respect this action.

The notion of planar operads takes its name from the fact that the operations in a planar operad may naturally be drawn as [[planar trees]] without, in general, a relation between two trees that cannot be related by a planar deformation into each other.

## Examples

* The operad [[Assoc]] for associative [[monoids]] is the [[terminal object]] in the category of planar $V$-operads, for choices such as $V = $  [[Set]], [[sSet]], [[Top]], etc.
