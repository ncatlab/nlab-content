## Idea

Given any object $X$ in a [[cartesian monoidal category]] where [[formal completion]] is defined, then the _formal neighbourhood of the diagonal_ of $X$ is the [[formal completion]] of the [[diagonal]] map $\Delta_X \colon X \longrightarrow X \times X$. 

Hence intuitively, the formal neighbourhood of the diagonal of $X$ is the space whose points are pairs of infinitesimally close points in $X$.

Specifically for $X$ a [[scheme]], then the formal neighbourhood of its diagonal is the [[formal scheme]] around $\Delta_X$. In this case the [[coequalizer]] of the two projections out of the formal neighbourhood is called the [[de Rham stack]] of $X$. Moreover, the (sheaf of modules of) sections of the formal neighbourhood, with respect to one of the two projection maps, is the [[tangent complex]] of $X$. This holds indeed more generally, at least also for $X$ a [[derived stack|derived]] [[algebraic stack]] ([Hennion 13](#Hennion13)).
 

More generally, see at _[[infinitesimal disk bundle]]_.
