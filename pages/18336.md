An informal term, usually synonymous with [[assignment]], whose being and remaining _undefined_ is the very point of its usefulness: it is a useful catch-all, avoiding terms like [[function]] or [[map]] which are 

* usually precisely defined within a given context, 

* sometimes not what one means to say.


Another recommendable (and widespread) practice is to try to avoid nouns altogether and resort to English verbs like _send_, _assign_, _take to_.
