In a very common sense of the word, "operation" connotes a [[map]] between [[sorts]] or [[types]], especially when interpreting [[algebraic theories]] such as the theory of [[groups]], which involves a set or type $X$ and prescribed operations such as a binary multiplication map $X \times X \to X$. In such cases, an operation is considered as having an assigned [[arity]], for example arity $2$ for a binary operation, or arity $1$ for an unary operation such as the power set operation $P: V \to V$ on the [[universe]] of sets. 

There is however no single global definition which precisely delineates all usages of the word "operation" in mathematics; thus, "operation" functions as something of a catch-all term with varying connotations. Some pages within the nLab in which the word appears include 

* [[operad]] 

* [[cohomology operation]] 

* [[six operations]] 

* [[quantification]] 

among others, many of which describe concepts related to the general notion of algebraic theory (such as [[magma]], [[Lawvere theory]], [[Mal'cev theory]], etc.). One might stop short of synonymizing "operation" simply with the word "[[function]]", but just in what way is hard to say; suffice it to say there may be shades of meaning or context where one is definitely inclined to choose one word over the other.
