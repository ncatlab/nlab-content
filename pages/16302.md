The text explicitly discusses formalization in [[categorical logic]] of Hegelian concepts such as 

* [[abstract general]], [[abstract particular]], [[concrete particular]] by categorical [[theories]] ([[Lawvere theories]]) and their [[models]];

* [[unity of opposites]] by [[adjoint modalities]].
