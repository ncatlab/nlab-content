which argues that "[[objective logic]]" in the sense of [[Georg Hegel]]'s _[[Science of Logic]]_ should be understood as being captured by [[universal constructions]] of [[category theory]]/[[topos theory]], whereas the "[[subjective logic]]" is to be understood as ordinary [[deduction]]/inference about objects such constructed.

The text explicitly discusses formalization in [[categorical logic]] of Hegelian concepts such as 

* [[abstract general]], [[concrete general]] and [[concrete particular|particular]] by categorical [[theories]] ([[Lawvere theories]]) and their [[models]];

* [[unity of opposites]] by [[adjoint modalities]].
