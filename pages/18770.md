## Idea

_Synthetic differential topology_ (SDT) is a [[synthetic mathematics|synthetic]] axiomatization of [[differential topology]] in analogy to how [[synthetic differential geometry]] (SDG) is [[synthetic mathematics|synthetic]] axiomatization of [[differential geometry]].

Where in SDG the concept of _[[infinitesimal neighbourhoods]]_ is encoded by the [[axioms]] (the [[Kock-Lawvere axiom]]) in SDT it is _[[germs of spaces]]_ that are being encoded by the axioms.

Notice that the germ of a manifold around a point is in general "larger" than the [[formal neighbourhood]] of that point, reflecting, dually, the fact that there are [[smooth functions]] which are non-vanishing in every [[open neighbourhood]] of that point but all whose [[partial derivatives]] vanish at that point (see also at _[[bump function]]_).

SDT uses the representability of germs by an object defined intrinsically as the points not well-separated from $0 \in R^n$, $\neg \neg \{0\}$.
