this page is to eventually collect material on 

* {#EPSBOI} [[Georg Hegel]], 

  _Philosophie der Natur_  

  in 

  _Enzyklopädie der philosophischen Wissenschaften im Grundrisse_ 

  (1830) 

  in W. Bonsiepen und H.-C. Lucas (eds.), _Gesammelte Werke_, Rheinisch-Westfälischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, and xx. Hamburg: Felix Meiner, 1992 ( Bonsiepen/Lucas 1992) 

on, roughly, [[natural philosophy]]. For the moment see at 

* _[Science of Logic -- Philosophy of Nature](Science+of+Logic#PhilosophyOfNature)_.


## Some material...

> {#202} §202 Other mathematical determinations, such as infinity and its relationships, the infinitesimal, factors, powers, and so on, have their true concepts in philosophy itself. It is awkward to want to take and derive these from mathematics, where they are employed in a nonconceptual, often meaningless way; rather, they must await their justification and significance from philosophy. 

> §202 The truly philosophical science of mathematics as theory of magnitude would be the science of measures, but this already presupposes the real particularity of things, which is only at hand in concrete nature.

Compare to [Science of Logic §709](Sciene+of+Logic#709): 

> SoL §709 The development of measure which has been attempted in the following chapters is extremely difficult. Starting from immediate, external measure it should, on the one hand, go on to develop the abstract determination of the quantitative aspects of natural objects (a mathematics of nature), and on the other hand, to indicate the connection between this determination of measure and the qualities of natural object
