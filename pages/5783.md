## Idea

A _super $\infty$-groupoid_ is an [[∞-groupoid]] modeled on [[super point]]s. 

The notion subsumes and generalizes that of _bare_ [[super group]]s, not thought that of [[super Lie group]]s. The latter are instead examples of [[smooth super ∞-groupoid]]s sitting over the base of super $\infty$-groupoids.

## Definition

Consider the category $SuperPoint$ of [[super point]]s as a  [[site]] with trivial [[coverage]].  

We say that the [[(∞,1)-sheaf (∞,1)-topos]] over $SuperPoint$

$$
  Super\infty Grpd := Sh_{(\infty,1)}(SuperPoint)
$$

is the [[(∞,1)-topos]] of **super $\infty$-groupoids**.

## Properties

$Super\infty Grpd$ is a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]].

Let 

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    SmoothSuper\infty Grpd & := Sh_{(\infty,1)}(CartSp, Super\infty Grpd)
    \simeq
     Sh_{(\infty,1)}(CartSp\times SuperPoint, \infty Grpd)
    \\
    & =:
     Sh_{(\infty,1)}(CartSp\times SuperPoint)
  \end{aligned}
$$

be the [[(∞,1)-sheaf (∞,1)-topos]] of [[smooth super ∞-groupoid]]s. This is cohesive over the [[base topos]] $Super \infty Grpd$.

## References

The proposal that the study of super-structures in mathematics should be regarded as taking place over the [[base topos]] on the [[site]] of [[super point]]s has been made around 1984 in
