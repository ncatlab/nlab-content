## Idea

A _super $\infty$-groupoid_ is an [[∞-groupoid]] modeled on [[super point]]s. The notion subsumes and generalizes that of _bare_ [[super group]]s, not thought that of [[super Lie group]]s, these are instead examples of [[smooth super ∞-groupoid]]s.

## Definition

Fix a ground [[field]] $k$. Write $anAlg_k$ for the [[category]] whose objects are $\mathbb{Z}_2$-[[graded algebra]]s of the form $k \oplus N$ with $N$ nilponent and whose morphisms are $k$-algebra homomorphisms. Write 

$$
  SuperPoint := anAlg_k^{op}
$$

for its [[opposite category]]. Regard this as a [[site]] with trivial [[coverage]].  

We say that the [[(∞,1)-sheaf (∞,1)-topos]] over $SuperPoint$

$$
  Super\infty Grpd := Sh_{(\infty,1)}(SuperPoint)
$$

is the [[(∞,1)-topos]] of **super $\infty$-groupoids**.

## Properties

$Super\infty Grpd$ is a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]].

The proposal that the study of super-structures in mathematics should be regarded as taking place over the [[topos]] on the [[site]] of [[super point]]s has been made by [[Albert Schwarz]] in
