## Idea

In the context of [[modal logic]], by _possible world semantics_ one means the interpretation of the [[possibility]] and [[necessity]] [[modalities]] as [[existential quantification]] and [[universal quantification]] over a [[context]] of "possible worlds". Such a model is sometimes referred to as a [[Kripke frame]].

For formalization of this in terms of [[hyperdoctrines]]/[[dependent type theory]] see at _[necessity and possibility -- In first-order logic and dependent type theory](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/necessity+and+possibility#InFirstOrderLogicAndTypeTheory)_.

Under [[categorical semantics]] such a context interprets as an [[object]] of some [[category]] whose interpretation is similar to that of a [[probability space]] in [[measure theory]] -- which is one sensible formalization of possible worlds (e.g. [Toronto-McCarthy 10, slide 23](#TorontoMcCarthy10)).
