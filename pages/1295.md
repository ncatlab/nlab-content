## Idea

The concept of [[cartesian product]] makes sense for any [[family of sets]], while the category-theoretic [[product]] makes sense for any family of objects.  In each case, however, the family is indexed by a [[set]]; how can we get a purely category-theoretic product indexed by an object?

First we need to describe a family of objects indexed by an object; it\'s common to interpret this as a [[bundle]], that is an arbitrary morphism $g: B \to A$.  (In [[Set]], $A$ would be the index set of the family, and the [[fiber]] of the bundle over an element $x$ of $A$ would be the set indexed by $x$.  Conversely, given a family of sets, $B$ can be constructed as its [[disjoint union]].)

In these terms, the cartesian product of the family of sets is the set $S$ of (global) [[section]]s of the bundle.  This set comes equipped with an evaluation map $ev: S \times A \to B$ such that
$$ S \times A \stackrel{ev}\to B \stackrel{g}\to A $$
equals the usual product projection; in other words, $ev$ is a morphism in the [[over category]] $Set/A$.  The [[universal property]] of $S$ is that, given any set $T$ and morphism $T \times A \to B$ in $Set/A$, there\'s a unique map $T \to S$ that makes everything commute.

In other words, $S$ and $ev$ define an [[adjoint functor|adjunction]] from $Set$ to $Set/A$ in which taking the product with $A$ is the left adjoint and applying this universal property is the right adjoint.  This is the basis for the definition below, but we add one further level of generality: we move everything from $Set$ to an arbitrary over category $Set/I$.

We also consider dependent *sums*, which are actually simpler.


## Definitions

For $C$ a [[category]], the **dependent product** of the morphism $g\colon B \to A$ indexed by the morphism $f\colon A \to I$ is an object $\prod_f g$ in the [[over category]] $C/I$, where the operation $\prod_f\colon C/A \to C/I$ is [[generalized the|the]] [[adjoint functor|right adjoint]] to the [[base change]] functor $f^*\colon C/I \to C/A$. For this to make sense, $f^*$ must exist; that is, all [[pullback]]s along $f$ must exist.  So a category with all dependent products is necessarily a category with all [[pullback]]s.

In [[type theory]], the operation of dependent product is typically taken as a primitive; see [[dependent product type]].  When employing the [[Curry–Howard correspondence]], one sometimes (such as in [[Coq]]) writes $\Pi_{x \in X} P_x$ as written $\forall x\colon X, P x$, because dependent products correspond to [[universal quantification]].

The *left* adjoint to the base-change functor, the __dependent coproduct__ or __[[dependent sum]]__ $\sum_f: C/A \to C/I$, is much simpler.  It is simply given by [[composition]] with $f$, so it always exists when it makes sense (that is when $f$ has all pullbacks).  In the Curry--Howard correspondence, this corresponds to the [[particular quantification]] $\exists x\colon X, P x$.  See [[dependent sum type]].

Note that the binary [[cartesian product]] is a special case of the direct *sum*: when $g\colon B\to A$ is a constant family, i.e. a [[projection]] $C \times A \to A$ from a binary [[product]], then its dependent sum is just the ordinary cartesian product $C \times A$.  In this context, the dependent product can be identified with the [[exponential object]] $C^A$.  In other words, *dependent sums generalize ordinary products*, while *dependent products generalize ordinary exponentials*.  (For this reason, one occasionally finds the dependent *sum* called the "dependent product".)  This is essentially a [[categorification|categorified]] version of the familiar fact that the product $n\cdot m$ of two [[natural numbers]] can be identified with the sum $\overset{n}{\overbrace{m+\dots +m}}$ of $n$ copies of $m$.

###### Proposition

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[cartesian closed category]] with all [[limit]]s. Let $X \in C$ be any object.

Then the dependent product functor

$$
  \mathcal{C}/X
   \stackrel{\overset{- \times X}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\prod_{x \in X}}{\to}}
  \mathcal{C}
$$

sends [[bundle]]s $P \to X$ to their object of [[section]]s 

$$
  \prod_{x \in X} P_x
  \simeq
  \Gamma_X(P)
  :=  
  [X,P] \times_{[X,X]} \{id\}
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

One computes for every $A \in \mathcal{C}$

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \mathcal{C}(A \times X, P \to X)
      &= 
    \mathcal{C}(A \times X, P ) \times_{\mathcal{C}(A \times X, X)} \{p_2\}
    \\
      & =
      \mathcal{C}(A, [X,P]) \times_{\mathcal{C}(A,[X,X])} \{\tilde p_2\}
     \\  
      &=
      \mathcal{C}(A, [X,P] \times_{[X,X]} \{Id\})
     \\
      &=  \mathcal{C}(A, \Gamma_X(P))
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

###### Remark

This statement and its proof remain valid in [[homotopy theory]]. More in detail, if $\mathcal{C}$ is a [[simplicial model category]], $X$, $A$ and $X \times A$ are cofibrant, $P$ and $X$ are fibrant and $P \to X$ is a [[fibration]], then $\Gamma_X(A)$ as above is the homotopy-correct [[derived hom-space|derived section space]].

### Relation to quantification in logic

In terms of the [[internal logic]] of categories, when one considers [[propositions as types]], one has that

* dependent sum corresponds to [[existential quantification]];

* dependent product corresponds to [[universal quantification]].

See there for more details.

## Examples

Dependent products (and sums) exist in any [[topos]]:

+-- {: .un_prop }
###### Proposition

For $C$ a topos and $f : A \to I$ any morphism in $C$, both the left adjoint $\sum_f : C/A \to C/I$ as well as the right adjoint $\prod_f: C/A \to C/I$ to $f^*: C/I \to C/A$ exist. 

Moreover, $f^*$ preserves the  [[subobject classifier]] and [[internal hom]]s.

This is ([MacLaneMoerdijk, theorem 2 in section IV, 7](#MacLaneMoerdijk)).

The dependent product plays a role in the definition of [[universe in a topos]].
