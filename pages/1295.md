## Idea

The _dependent product_ is a [[universal construction]] in [[category theory]]. It generalizes the [[internal hom]], and hence indexed [[products]], to the situation where the codomain may _depend_ on the domain, hence it forms _[[sections]]_ of a [[bundle]]. 

The [[duality|dual]] concept is that of _[[dependent sum]]_.

The concept of [[cartesian product]] of [[sets]] makes sense for any [[family of sets]], while the [[category theory|category-theoretic]] [[product]] makes sense for any family of objects.  In each case, however, the family is indexed by a [[set]]; how can we get a purely category-theoretic product indexed by an object?

First we need to describe a family of objects indexed by an object; it\'s common to interpret this as a [[bundle]], that is an arbitrary morphism $g: B \to A$.  (In [[Set]], $A$ would be the index set of the family, and the [[fiber]] of the bundle over an element $x$ of $A$ would be the set indexed by $x$.  Conversely, given a family of sets, $B$ can be constructed as its [[disjoint union]].)

In these terms, the cartesian product of the family of sets is the set $S$ of (global) [[section]]s of the bundle.  This set comes equipped with an evaluation map $ev: S \times A \to B$ such that
$$ S \times A \stackrel{ev}\to B \stackrel{g}\to A $$
equals the usual product projection; in other words, $ev$ is a morphism in the [[over category]] $Set/A$.  The [[universal property]] of $S$ is that, given any set $T$ and morphism $T \times A \to B$ in $Set/A$, there\'s a unique map $T \to S$ that makes everything commute.

In other words, $S$ and $ev$ define an [[adjoint functor|adjunction]] from $Set$ to $Set/A$ in which taking the product with $A$ is the left adjoint and applying this universal property is the right adjoint.  This is the basis for the definition below, but we add one further level of generality: we move everything from $Set$ to an arbitrary over category $Set/I$.



## Definitions

Let  $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[category]], and $g\colon B \to A$ a [[morphism]] in $\mathcal{C}$, such that [[pullbacks]] along this morphism exist. These then constitute the [[base change]] [[functor]] between the corresponding [[slice categories]]

$$
  g^* \colon \mathcal{C}_{/A} \to \mathcal{C}_{/B}
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

The **dependent product** along $g$ is, if it exists, the [[right adjoint]] functor $\prod_g \colon : \mathcal{C}_{/B} \to \mathcal{C}_{/A}$ to the [[base change]] along $g$

$$
  (g^* \vdash \prod_g)
  \colon
  \mathcal{C}_{/B}
   \stackrel{\overset{g^* }{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\prod_g}{\to}}
  \mathcal{C}_{/A}
  \,.
$$

So a category with all dependent products is necessarily a category with all [[pullbacks]].

### Relation to spaces of sections
 {#RelationToSpacesOfSections}

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[cartesian closed category]] with all [[limit]]s. Let $X \in C$ be any object.

Then the dependent product functor

$$
  \mathcal{C}/X
   \stackrel{\overset{- \times X}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\prod_{x \in X}}{\to}}
  \mathcal{C}
$$

sends [[bundle]]s $P \to X$ to their [[space of sections|object of sections]]. 

$$
  \prod_{x \in X} P_x
  \simeq
  \Gamma_X(P)
  :=  
  [X,P] \times_{[X,X]} \{id\}
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

One computes for every $A \in \mathcal{C}$

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \mathcal{C}(A \times X, P \to X)
      &= 
    \mathcal{C}(A \times X, P ) \times_{\mathcal{C}(A \times X, X)} \{p_2\}
    \\
      & =
      \mathcal{C}(A, [X,P]) \times_{\mathcal{C}(A,[X,X])} \{\tilde p_2\}
     \\  
      &=
      \mathcal{C}(A, [X,P] \times_{[X,X]} \{Id\})
     \\
      &=  \mathcal{C}(A, \Gamma_X(P))
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

###### Remark

This statement and its proof remain valid in [[homotopy theory]]. More in detail, if $\mathcal{C}$ is a [[simplicial model category]], $X$, $A$ and $X \times A$ are cofibrant, $P$ and $X$ are fibrant and $P \to X$ is a [[fibration]], then $\Gamma_X(A)$ as above is the homotopy-correct [[derived hom-space|derived section space]].

### Relation to exponential objects / internal homs

As a special case of the above one obtains [[exponential objects]]/[[internal homs]].

Let $\mathcal{C}$ have a [[terminal object]] $* \in \mathcal{C}$. Let $X \in \mathcal{C}$ be any object and let $X \colon X \to *$ be the terminal morphism.

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The dependent product along $X$ of the base change along $X$ is the [[exponential object]]/[[internal hom]] $[X,A]$

$$
  \prod_{X} X^* A \simeq [X,A]  \in \mathcal{C}
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

This is essentially a [[categorification|categorified]] version of the familiar fact that the product $n\cdot m$ of two [[natural numbers]] can be identified with the sum $\overset{n}{\overbrace{m+\dots +m}}$ of $n$ copies of $m$.

### Relation to type theory and quantification in logic

The dependent product is the [[categorical semantics]] of what in [[type theory]] is the [[type formation|formation]] of [[dependent product types]].  Under [[propositions as types]] this corresponds to [[universal quantification]].

## Examples

Dependent products (and sums) exist in any [[topos]]:

+-- {: .un_prop }
###### Proposition

For $C$ a topos and $f : A \to I$ any morphism in $C$, both the left adjoint $\sum_f : C/A \to C/I$ as well as the right adjoint $\prod_f: C/A \to C/I$ to $f^*: C/I \to C/A$ exist. 

Moreover, $f^*$ preserves the  [[subobject classifier]] and [[internal hom]]s.

This is ([MacLaneMoerdijk, theorem 2 in section IV, 7](#MacLaneMoerdijk)).

The dependent product plays a role in the definition of [[universe in a topos]].
