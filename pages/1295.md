#Definition#

For $C$ a [[category]] with the required [[limit]]s needed below, the **dependent product** of the [[morphism]] $g : B \to A$ indexed by the morphism $f : A \to I$ is the [[object]] $\Pi_f g \in C/I$ in the [[over category]] $C/I$ which is the image under the [[right adjoint]] $\Pi_f : C/A \to C/I$ of the [[pullback]] functor $f^* : C/I \to C/A$.

#Examples#

* this plays a role in the definition of [[universe in a topos]].
