
For a [[smooth morphism]] $p$ of smooth [[analytic space]]s or of [[smooth schemes]] $p\colon X \to S$ a __$p$-connection__ is an $\mathcal{O}_X$-linear map $\nabla_S\colon p^* T_S \to T_X$ such that $\mathrm{d}p \circ \nabla_S = id_{p^* T_S}$. The "[[differential]]" $\mathrm{d}p$ here is the map $T_S \to p^* T_X$ induced by the universality of the [[pullback]] and the differential.  A $p$-connection is __flat/integrable__ if the corresponding ([[adjunct|by adjunction]]) map $T_S \to p_* T_X$ commutes with brackets of [[tangent vector field|vector fields]].
