[[!redirects p--connection]]

For a [[smooth morphism]] $p$ of smooth [[analytic space]]s or of [[smooth schemes]] $p:X\to S$ a __$p$-connection__ is an $\mathcal{O}_X$-linear map $\nabla_S:p^* T_S\to T_X$ such that $dp\circ \nabla_S=id_{p^* T_S}$. The "differential" $dp$ here is the map $T_S\to p^* T_X$ induced by the universality of the pullback and  the differential.  $p$-connection is __flat/integrable__ if the corresponding (by adjunction) map $T_S\to p_* T_X$ commutes with brackets of vector fields.
