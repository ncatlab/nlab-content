## Definition

For $G$ a [[perfect group]]. The _universal [[central extension]]_ of $G$ is the essentially unique [[group]] $K$ that is a [[Schur covering group]] of $G$.


## Properties

* The universal central extension of a perfect group is also perfect.

* The universal central extension of a perfect group is a Schur-trivial group, and hence a superperfect group (superperfect means that it's perfect and Schur-trivial).

* The universal central extension operator is idempotent, i.e., the universal central extension of the universal central extension is the universal central extension. This follows directly from the universal central extension being a Schur-trivial group.
