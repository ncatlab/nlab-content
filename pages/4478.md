## Definition

An [[associative algebra|associative]] [[unital algebra|unital]] algebra $A$ over a [[field]] $k$ is **semisimple** if its [[Jacobson radical]] is trivial.  

## Properties

If $A$ is finite-dimensional, this is equivalent to saying that $A$ is a finite product of finite-dimensional [[simple algebra|simple algebras]].  

By the [[Artin-Wedderburn theorem]], any finite-dimensional simple algebra over $k$ is a [[matrix algebra]] with entries lying in some [[division algebra]] whose [[center]] is $k$.  So, every finite-dimensional semisimple algebra is a finite product of such matrix algebras.
