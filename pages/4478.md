An [[associative algebra|associative]] [[unital algebra|unital]] algebra $A$ over a field $k$ is **semisimple** if its [[Jacobson radical]] is trivial.  If $A$ is finite-dimensional, this is equivalent to saying that $A$ is a finite product of finite-dimensional [[simple algebra|simple algebras]].  

By the Artin--Wedderburn theorem, any finite-dimensional simple algebra over $k$ is a matrix algebra with entries lying in some [[division algebra]] whose center is $k$.  So, every finite-dimensional semisimple algebra is a finite product of such matrix algebras.
