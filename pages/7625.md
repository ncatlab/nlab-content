## Idea

In the [[AQFT]] formalization of [[quantum field theory]] a [[local net of observables]] assigns to each region of [[spacetime]] the [[algebra]] of [[observables]] localized in that region. But in typical constructions of [[quantum field theories]] this algebra is obtained from an algebra of quantum fields that are _not_ all observable by quotienting out a [[gauge group]] [[action]]. A **field net** corresponding to a [[local net of observables]] is a [[net of C-star-systems]] which formalizes this idea, notably so that the quotient by the group action reproduces the given local net of observables.
