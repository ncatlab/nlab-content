## Definition

Given an element $a$ of a [[Boolean algebra]] $A$, we say that $a$ is **atomic** in $A$ if $a$ is minimal among non-trivial elements of $A$.  That is, given any $b\in A$ such that $b\leq a$, either $b=0$ or $b=a$.

A Boolean algebra $A$ is __atomic__ if we have $b=\bigvee_I a_i$ for every $b\in  A$, where $\{a_i\}_I$ is some set of atoms in $A$.

## Properties

* A [[complete lattice|complete]] atomic Boolean algebra is necessarily a [[power set]].
