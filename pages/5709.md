## Idea

While fundamental [[physics]] is at some level well described by [[quantum field theory]], a typical [[Lagrangian]] used to define such a QFT can reasonably be expected to define only degrees of freedom and interactions that are relevant up to some given [[energy]] scale. In this perspective one speaks of the theory as being the _effective quantum field theory_ of some -- possibly known but possibly unspecified -- more fundamental theory.

An example (historically the first to be successfully considered) is the [[Fermi theory of beta decay]] of hadrons: this contains interactions of four [[fermion]]s at a time, for instance a process in which a [[neutron]] decays into a collection consisting of a [[proton]], an [[electron]] and a [[neutrino]]. Later it was discovered that, more fundamentally, this is not a single reaction but is composed out of several other interactions that involve exchanges of [[W-boson]]s between these four particles. Nevertheless, Fermi's original _effective_ theory made very precise predictions at energy scales less than 10 [[MeV]]. The reason is that the $W$-boson has mass several orders of magnitude higher than that (about 80 [[GeV]]) and was thus _effectively_ invisible at these low energies.

The low energy expansion of any unitary, relativistic, [[crossing symmetry|crossing symmetric]] [[S-matrix]] can be described by an effective quantum field theory.

In the perspective of effective field theory notably  [[renormalization|unrenormalizable]] Lagrangians can still make perfect sense as effective theories and give rise to well defined predictions: they can be effective approximations to renormalizable or even degreewise finite more fundamental theories. This is sometimes called a [[UV completion]] of the given effective theory.

For instance [[gravity]] -- which is notoriously non-renormalizable -- makes perfect sense as an effective field theory (see for instance the introduction in ([Donoghue](#DonoghueIntroduction)). It is in principle possible that there is some more fundamental theory with plenty of excitations at high energies that is however degreewise finite in [[perturbation theory]], whose _effective_ description at low energy is given by the unrenormalizable [[Einstein-Hilbert action]]. (For instance, [[string theory]] is meant to be such a theory.)



## Theory

The technique of effective field theory is based on the following fact:

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

For a given set of asymptotic states, [[perturbation theory]] with the most
general [[Lagrangian]] containing all terms allowed by the assumed symmetries
will yield the most general [[S-matrix]] elements consistent with
analyticity, [[perturbative unitarity]], [[cluster decomposition]] and the assumed symmetries.

=--

This is due to ([Weinberg 1979](#Weinberg79)) and ([Leutweyler94](#Leutwyler94)).

Based on this fact, one obtains an effective approximation to a given more fundamental theory (which may or may not be actually known) by

1. choosing the (sub)set of fields to be considered;

1. writing down a [[Lagrangian]] 

   $$
     L_{eff} = \sum_i c_i O_i
   $$

   that contains _all_ the possible polynomial interaction terms $O_i$ of these fields scaled by their expected/known energy scale $[O_i] = d_i$, up to a maximal energy scale

   (this will in general contain lots of direct interaction that in the fundamental theory are really compound interactions)

    with $c_i \propto \frac{1}{\Lambda^{d_i - dim X}}$;

1. finally one fixes all the coupling constants of all these interactions by

   * either deriving them from a known fundamental theory by _integrating out_ higher energy effects in that theory;

   * or, otherwise, measuring them in the laboratory. The point being that due to the energy cutoff, this is guaranteed to be a finite number of parameters. After these have been determined, all remaining quantities given by the Lagrangian are then predictions of the effective theory.

On [[neutrino]] [[masses]] and the [[standard model of particle physics]] as an effective field theory:

> I also noted at the same time that interactions between a pair of lepton doublets and a pair of scalar doublets can generate a neutrino mass, which is suppressed only by a factor $M^{-1}$, and that therefore with a reasonable estimate of $M$ could produce observable neutrino oscillations. The subsequent confirmation of neutrino oscillations lends support to the view of the Standard Model as an effective field theory, with M somewhere in the neighborhood of $10^{16} GeV$.

### String theory and gravity coupled to gauge theory
 {#StringTheoryAndGravityCoupledToGaugeTheory}

The [[string scattering amplitudes]] for [[superstrings]] are finite (fully proven so for low loop order and with various plausibility arguments for higher loop order, see at _[[string scattering amplitudes]]_ for more), hence define a UV-complete [[S-matrix]]. The corresponding low energy effective field theories are theories of [[supergravity]] coupled to [[gauge theory]]. ([[type II supergravity]], [[heterotic supergravity]]).
