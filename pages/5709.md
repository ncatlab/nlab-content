## Idea

While fundamental [[physics]] is at some level well described by [[quantum field theory]], a typical [[Lagrangian]] used to define such a QFT can reasonably be expected to define only degrees of freedom and interactions that are relevant up to some given [[energy]] scale. In this perspective one speaks of the theory as being the _effective quantum field theory_ of some -- possibly known but possibly unspecified -- more fundamental theory.

An example (historically the first to be successfully considered) is the [[Fermi theory of beta decay]] of hadrons: this contains interactions of four [[fermion]]s at a time, for instance a process in which a [[neutron]] decays into a collection consisting of a [[proton]], an [[electron]] and a [[neutrino]]. Later it was discovered that, more fundamentally, this is not a single reaction but is composed out of several other interactions that involve exchanges of [[W-boson]]s between these four particles. Nevertheless, Fermi's original _effective_ theory made very precise predictions at energy scales less than 10 [[MeV]]. The reason is that the $W$-boson has mass several orders of magnitude higher than that (about 80 [[GeV]]) and was thus _effectively_ invisible at these low energies.

The low energy expansion of any unitary, relativistic, [[crossing symmetry|crossing symmetric]] [[S-matrix]] can be described by an effective quantum field theory.

In the perspective of effective field theory notably  [[renormalizable interaction|non-renormalizable]] [[interaction]]  Lagrangians can still make perfect sense as effective theories and give rise to well defined predictions: they can be effective approximations to [[renormalizable interaction|renormalizable]] more fundamental theories. This is sometimes called a [[UV completion]] of the given effective theory.

For instance [[quantum gravity]] -- which is notoriously [[non-renormalizable interacton|non-renormalizable]] -- makes perfect sense as an effective field theory (see for instance the introduction in ([Donoghue](#DonoghueIntroduction)). It is in principle possible that there is some more fundamental theory with plenty of excitations at high energies that is however degreewise finite in [[perturbation theory]], whose _effective_ description at low energy is given by the [[renormalizable interaction|non-renormalizable]] [[Einstein-Hilbert action]]. (For instance, [[string theory]] is meant to be such a theory.)



## Details

### In causal perturbation theory

> under construction

We discuss the rigorous formulation of effective [[perturbative QFT]] in terms of [[causal perturbation theory]]/[perturbative AQFT]], due to ([Brunetti-Dütsch-Fredenhagen 09, section 5.2](#BrunettiDuetschFredenhagen09), [Dütsch 10](#Duetsch10)), reviewed in [Dütsch 18, section 3.8](#Duetsch18)).




Let vac be  free field vacuum on [[Minkowski spacetime]]
with corresponding [[Feynman propagator]] $\Delta_F \in \Gamma'_{\Sigma \times \Sigma}(E_{\text{BV-BRST}} \boxtimes E_{\text{BV-BRST}})$.

A _UV-regularization_ of [[perturbative QFT]] around this vacuum is a
$\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$-parameterized collection of [[non-singular distributions]], hence a function

$$
  \array{
    \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}
      &\overset{}{\longrightarrow}&
    \Gamma_{\Sigma \times \Sigma,cp}(E_{\text{BV-BRST}} \boxtimes E_{\text{BV-BRST}})
    \\
    \Lambda &\mapsto& \Delta_{F,\Lambda}
  }
$$

such that

1. $\Delta_{F,\Lambda}$ is symmetric for each $\Lambda \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$:

   $$
     \Delta^{b a}_{F,\Lambda}(y, x)
     \;=\;
     \Delta^{a b}_{F,\Lambda}(x, y)
   $$

1. the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] of the _UV-regularized propagators_ $\Delta_{F,\Lambda}$
   for $\Lambda \to \infty$ is the [[Feynman propagator]]

   $$
     \underset{\Lambda \to \infty}{\lim} \Delta_{F,\Lambda}
     \;=\;
     \Delta_F
   $$


Given a UV-regularization, then

the _UV-regularized time-ordered product_ is the $\Lambda$-parameterized collection of [[star products]]
induced by $\Delta_{F,\Lambda}$

$$
  \array{
    PolyObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})_{mc}[ [ \hbar, g, j] ]
      \otimes_{\mathbb{C}[ [ \hbar, g, j] ]}
    PolyObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})_{mc}[ [ \hbar, g, j] ]
      &\overset{\phantom{AA} \star_{F,\Lambda} \phantom{AA}  }{\longrightarrow}&
    PolyObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})_{mc}[ [ \hbar, g, j] ]
    \\
    (A_1, A_2)
      &\mapsto&
    ((-)\cdot(-))
      \circ
    \exp\left( \hbar \langle \Delta_{F,\Lambda}, \frac{\delta}{\delta \mathbf{\Phi}}\otimes \frac{\delta}{\delta \mathbf{\Phi}} \rangle  \right)
    (A_1 \otimes A_2)
  }
$$

by ... all these are isomorphic to the pointwise product by [[conjugation]] with

proposition

given a UV-regularization, then there exist  [[interaction vertex redefinitions]] $\{\mathcal{Z}_\Lambda\}_{\Lambda \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}}$
such that the [[limit of a sequence|limit]]

$$
  \mathcal{S}_\infty
  \coloneqq
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \underset{\Lambda \to \infty}{\lim} 
  \left(
    \mathcal{S}_\Lambda \circ \mathcal{Z}_\Lambda
  \right)
$$

exists and is an [[S-matrix scheme]], and every perturbative S-matrix scheme arises this way.


([Dütsch 18, theorem 3.127](#Duetsch18))



Definition counterterms

Let $\{\Delta_{F,\Lambda}\}$ be a UV-regularization and let
$g S_{int} + j A \in LocObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})[ [ \hbar, g, j] ]\langle g,j\rangle$ be a 
[[local observable]], regarded as an [[adiabatic switching|adiabatically switched]] [[interaction]] [[action functional]]. 

Then prop. ... says that there exists [[vertex redefinitions]] of this [[interaction]]

$$
  \left\{ \mathcal{Z}_\Lambda(g S_{int} + j A)  \right\}_{\Lambda \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}}
$$

such that the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] 

$$
  \mathcal{S}_\infty(g S_{int} + j A)
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \underset{\Lambda \to \infty}{\lim}
  \mathcal{S}-\Lambda\left( \mathcal{Z}_\Lambda( g S_{int} + j A )\right)
$$

exists and is an [[S-matrix]] for [[perturbative QFT]] with the given [[interaction]] $g S_{int} + j A$.

In this case the difference

$$
  S_{counter, \Lmbda}
  \;\coloneqq\;
  g S_{int} + j A - \mathcal{Z}_{\Lambda}(g S_{int} + j A)
  \;\in\;
  LccObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})[ [ \hbar, g, j] ]
$$

is called a choice of _counterterms_ at regularization scale $\Lambda$.

In this language prop. ... says that for every free field vacuum and every choice of local interaction,
there is a choice of counterterms to the interaction that defines a corresponding [[perturbative QFT]],
and every such perturbative QFT arises from some choice of counterterms.


Given a UV-regularization, we say that for $\Lambda \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ 
the _regularized S-matrix_ at regulrization scale $\Lambda$

$$
  \array{
    PolyObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})_{mc}((\hbar))[ [g, j ] ]
      &\overset{ \phantom{AA} \mathcal{S}_{\Lambda} \phantom{AA} }{\longrightarrow}&
    PolyObs(E_{\text{BV-BRST}})_{mc}((\hbar))[ [g, j ] ]
    \\
    O &\mapsto& \mathcal{T}_\Lambda \exp_\cdot\left( \frac{1}{i\hbar} \mathcal{T}^{-1}(O) \right)
    \\
    && = 1 + \frac{1}{i \hbar} O + \frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{(i \hbar)^2} O \star_{F,\Lambda} O + \cdots
  }
$$

This is invertible, with inverse function

$$
  \mathcal{S}_{\Lambda}^{-1}
  \;=\;
  \mathcal{T}_\Lambda \circ \ln \circ i \hbar \mathcal{T}_{\Lambda}^{-1}
$$

For $g S_{int} + j A \in LocObs(E_{\text{BV-BrST}})[ [ \hbar, g, j] ]$ a [[local observable]]
regarded as an [[adiabatic switching|adiabatically switched]] [[interaction]] [[action functional]],
and  $\Lambda, \Lambda_{vac} \in (0, \infty)$, define the _relative [[effective action]]_

$$
  S_{eff,\Lambda, \Lambda_0}
  \;\coloneqq\;
  i \hbar
  \mathcal{S}_{\Lambda}^{-1} \circ \mathcal{S}_{\Lambda_0}(g S_{int} + j A)
  \phantom{AAA}
  \Lambda, \Lambda_0 \in [0,\infty)
$$

If counterterms and hence $\mathcal{S}_\infty$ is given, then this makes sense also for $\Lamba_0 = \infty$ 

$$
  S_{eff,\Lambda}
  \;\coloneqq\;
  i \hbar 
  \mathcal{S}_{\Lambda}^{-1} \circ \mathcal{S}_{\infty}(g S_{int} + j A)
  \phantom{AAA}
  \Lambda  \in [0,\infty)
$$

For $\Lambda = 0$ and $\Lambda_0 = \infty$ the relative effective action is the 

$\,$

### Traditional informal discussion

Traditional informal discussion of effective field theory proceeds from the following claim

_For a given set of asymptotic states, [[perturbation theory]] with the most
general [[Lagrangian]] containing all terms allowed by the assumed symmetries
will yield the most general [[S-matrix]] elements consistent with
analyticity, [[perturbative unitarity]], [[cluster decomposition]] and the assumed symmetries._

This is due to ([Weinberg 1979](#Weinberg79)) and ([Leutwyler94](#Leutwyler94)).

Based on this, one argues to obtains an effective approximation to a given more fundamental theory (which may or may not be actually known) by

1. choosing the (sub)set of fields to be considered;

1. writing down a [[Lagrangian]] 

   $$
     L_{eff} = \sum_i c_i O_i
   $$

   that contains _all_ the possible polynomial interaction terms $O_i$ of these fields scaled by their expected/known energy scale $[O_i] = d_i$, up to a maximal energy scale

   (this will in general contain lots of direct interaction that in the fundamental theory are really compound interactions)

    with $c_i \propto \frac{1}{\Lambda^{d_i - dim X}}$;

1. finally one fixes all the coupling constants of all these interactions by

   * either deriving them from a known fundamental theory by _integrating out_ higher energy effects in that theory;

   * or, otherwise, measuring them in the laboratory. The point being that due to the energy cutoff, this is guaranteed to be a finite number of parameters. After these have been determined, all remaining quantities given by the Lagrangian are then predictions of the effective theory.

### Chiral perturbation theory

[[chiral perturbation theory]] is an effective approximation of [[QCD]] in the light [[quark]] sector.


### Heavy quark effective field theory

(...)

### Neutrino masses (?)

On [[neutrino]] [[masses]] and the [[standard model of particle physics]] as an effective field theory:

&gt; I also noted at the same time that interactions between a pair of lepton doublets and a pair of scalar doublets can generate a neutrino mass, which is suppressed only by a factor $M^{-1}$, and that therefore with a reasonable estimate of $M$ could produce observable neutrino oscillations. The subsequent confirmation of neutrino oscillations lends support to the view of the Standard Model as an effective field theory, with M somewhere in the neighborhood of $10^{16} GeV$. ([Weinberg 09, p. 15](#Weinberg09))


### String theory and gravity coupled to gauge theory
 {#StringTheoryAndGravityCoupledToGaugeTheory}

The [[string scattering amplitudes]] for [[superstrings]] are finite (fully proven so for low loop order and with various plausibility arguments for higher loop order, see at _[[string scattering amplitudes]]_ for more), hence define a UV-complete [[S-matrix]]. The corresponding low energy effective field theories are theories of [[supergravity]] coupled to [[gauge theory]]. ([[type II supergravity]], [[heterotic supergravity]]).
