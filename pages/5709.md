## Idea

While fundamental [[physics]] is at some level well described by [[quantum field theory]], a typical [[Lagrangian]] used to define such a QFT can reasonably be expected to define only degrees of freedom and interactions that are relevant up to some energy scale. In this perspective one speaks of the theory as being the _effective quantum field theory_ of some -- possibly known but possibly unspecified -- more fundamental theory.

In this perspective notably an [[renormalization|unrenormalizable]] Lagrangian still makes sense as an effective field theory and gives rise to well defined predictions. 

Notably for instance [[gravity]] -- which is notoriously non-renormalizable -- makes perfect sense as an effective field theory (see for instance the introduction in ([Donoghue](#DonoghueIntroduction)). It is in principle possible that there is some more fundamental theory with plenty of excitations at high energies that is however degreewise finite in [[perturbation theory]], whose _effective_ description at low energy is given by the unrenormalizable [[Einstein-Hilbert action]]. (For instance [[string theory]] is meant to be such a theory.)

The theory of [[gravity]] based on the standard [[Einstein-Hilbert action]] may be regarded as just an effective QFT, which makes some of its notorious problems be non-problems:
