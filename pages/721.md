## Idea

A **Grothendieck pretopology** or **basis for a Grothendieck topology** is a collection of families of [[morphisms]] in a [[category]] which can be considered as [[cover|covers]].  

Every Grothendieck pretopology generates a genuine _[[Grothendieck topology]]_. Different pretopologies may give rise to the same topology.

An even weaker notion than a Grothendieck pretopology, which also generates a Grothendieck topology, is a [[coverage]].  A Grothendieck pretopology can be defined as a coverage that also satisfies a couple of extra saturation conditions.  (Note that it is coverages, not pretopologies, that most directly corresponds to [[bases of topological spaces]].


## Definition

See Definition II.1.3 in [[SGA]] 4.

###### Definition

Let $C$ be a [[category]].
A **Grothendieck pretopology** or **basis (for a [[Grothendieck topology]])** on $C$ is an assignment to each [[object]] $U$ of $C$ of a collection of families $\{U_i \to U\}$ of morphisms, called **[[covering]] families** such that

1. (Stability under [[base changes]].)
The collection of covering families is stable under [[pullback]]: if $\{U_i \to U\}$ is a covering family and $f : V \to U$ is any morphism in $C$, then $\{f^* U_i \to V\}$ exists and is a covering family;

1. (Stability under composition.)
If $\{U_i \to U\}_{i \in I}$ is a covering family and for each $i$ also $\{U_{i,j} \to U_i\}_{j \in J_i}$ is a covering family, then also the family of composites $\{U_{i,j} \to U_i \to U\}_{i\in I, j \in J_i}$ is a covering family.

1. (Isomorphisms cover.)
Every family consisting of a single [[isomorphism]] $\{V \stackrel{\cong}{\to}U\}$ is a covering family;

If we drop the second and third conditions, we obtain something a bit stronger than a [[coverage]]; at the page [[coverage]] this notion is called a *cartesian coverage*.  Conversely every coverage on a category with pullbacks generates a Grothendieck pretopology by an evident closure process.  However, many coverages that arise in practice are actually already Grothendieck pretopologies. On the other hand, for some analogues in noncommutative algebraic geometry, rather the stability axiom fails.

###### Definition


The [[Grothendieck topology]] on $C$ _generated_ from a basis of covering families is that for which a [[sieve]] $\{S_i \to U\}$ is covering precisely if it contains a covering family of morphisms.

## Properties

Given any [[Grothendieck topology]] on $C$, there is a **maximal basis** which generates it: this has as covering families precisely thoses families of morphisms that generate a covering sieve under completion under precomposition.


## Examples 


The prototype is the pretopology on the [[category of open subsets]] $Op(X)$ of a [[topological space]] $X$, consisting of [[open covers]] of $X$. 

Given a [[base for the topology]] on $X$,
we can construct a pretopology on $Op(X)$
by declaring that a family $\{U_i\to V\}_{i\in I}$ is a covering family
if it is an open cover and for every $i\in I$ the open set $U_i$
is the intersection of $V$ and an element of the base.

If instead we impose a stronger requirement that $U_i$ belongs to the base,
then the resulting [[coverage]] is not a pretopology,
since the intersection of such a covering family
with an arbitrary open subset of $X$ is an open cover
whose elements need not belong to the base.

Grothendieck pretopologies on [[Top]] include:

* [[local section|Local-section]]-admitting surjections
* Surjective [[open map|open maps]]
* Surjective [[topological submersion|topological submersions]]
* Surjective [[local homeomorphism|local homeomorphisms]]

An example for the category [[Diff]] of manifolds is the pretopology of [[surjective submersion]]s.  All of these have covering families consisting of single morphisms. Such a pretopology is called a *singleton* pretopology (and, in particular, it is a *singleton coverage*).

An example of a [[coverage]] that is not a pretopology is the coverage of [[good open covers]], say on [[Diff]]. In general the pullback of a good open cover is just an [[open cover]], not necessarily still one where all finite non-empty intersections are contractible.
