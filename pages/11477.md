## Idea

Topological André-Quillen homology is to [[A-∞ algebras]] as [[Kähler differentials]] are to [[associative algebra]].

## Related concepts

* [[André-Quillen homology]]

* [[topological Hochschild homology]]

## References

The definition is recalled for instance in section 2 of

* {#McCarthyManasian03} Randy McCarthy, Vahagn Minasian, _HKR Theorem for Smooth $S$-algebras_, [arxiv:math/0306243](http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0306243v1.pdf)

which otherwise proves the analog of the [[Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg theorem]] in this context.
