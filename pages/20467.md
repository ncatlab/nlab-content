## Idea

In the plain [[minimally supersymmetric standard model]] (MSSM), [[baryon]]/[[lepton]] [[number]] would not need to be preserved. Since however [[experimental observation]] indicates that these [[quantum observables]] are preserved to high accuracy, a common _ad hoc_ soluton in [[model (physics)|model]]-building is to impose a certain [[cyclic group of order 2|Z/2]]-[[action]] on the [[MSSM]] as a [[global symmetry]], which does enforce baryon/lepton number conservation.

However, there remain speculations that R-parity might in fact be violated in nature after all, such as as possibly indicated by the [[flavour anomalies]] ([Wang-Yang-Yuan 19](#WangYangYuan19)).
