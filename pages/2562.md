## Meanings

In [[category theory]], the __domain__ of a [[morphism]] is its [[source]] [[object]]; that is, the domain of $f\colon X \to Y$ is $X$.  In particular, this is the case for a [[function]]: its domain is the set of elements to which it can be [[function application|applied]].

However, this can conflict with other meanings of 'domain', especially in a category like [[Rel]].  For instance, for any [[subset]] $A\subseteq X$, there exists a [[relation]] $R\colon X \to Y$ whose "domain" is $A$ under some uses of the term.

Other similar meanings of the term include:

*  the [[domain of discourse]] of a [[predicate]],
*  an [[open subset]] of a [[manifold]], especially in [[complex analysis]].

A separate meaning of 'domain' occurs in [[domain theory]], which is at the interface of logic and theoretical computer science.
There a domain is a particular type of [[poset]], see the article [[dcpo]].
Still another meaning occurs in algebra in the term [[integral domain]].
