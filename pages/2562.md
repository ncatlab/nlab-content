
In [[category theory]], the __domain__ of a [[morphism]] is generally the same as its [[source]]; that is, the domain of $f\colon X \to Y$ is $X$.

However, this can conflict with other meanings of 'domain', especially in a category like [[Rel]]; any [[subset]] of $X$ is the domain of some [[relation]] $R\colon X \to Y$.

Other similar meanings of the term include:
*  the [[domain of discourse]] of a [[predicate]],
*  an [[open subset]] of a [[manifold]], especially in [[complex analysis]].

A separate meaning of 'domain' occurs in [[domain theory]], which is at the interface of logic and theoretical computer science. There a domain is a particular type of [[poset]].
