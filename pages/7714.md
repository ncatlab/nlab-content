## Idea

A generalization of the notion of _[[tangent bundle]]_ in _[[exceptional generalized geometry]]_.

For [[11-dimensional supergravity]] the bosonic [[body]] of  its [[typical fiber]] is 

$$
  \mathbb{R}^{d-1,1} \oplus \wedge^2 (\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1})^\ast
 \oplus \wedge^5 (\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1})^\ast
$$

where the second summand corresponds to [[M2-brane]] charges and the third to [[M5-brane charges]].

This happens to coincide with the bosonic body of the [[M-theory super Lie algebra]], see there for more.
