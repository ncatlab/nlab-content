
Given a square matrix $J$ (representing a bilinear form) over a commutative ring $k$, a $J$-orthogonal matrix is any square matrix $A$ of the same size over $k$ such that
$$
A^T J A = J
$$

where $A^T$ is a transpose of $A$. Most often one considers a case when $J$ is diagonal. For $J = 1$ one recovers the notion of an [[orthogonal matrix]].

All J-orthogonal matrices over the ground field form an algebraic group denoted $SO_J(n,\genfd)$ or $SO(n,\genfd; J)$ or alike; in real or complex case a Lie group. The matrices in the Lie algebra are J-skew-symmetric, $A^T J + J A = 0$.
