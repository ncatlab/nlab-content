Let $k$ be a commutative unital ring, usually a field.

A __nonassociative $k$-algebra__ is a $k$-module $V$ equipped with a bilinear product $V\otimes V\to V$.

This product is typically neither associative nor unital, although it can be (an example of the [[red herring principle]]).

Some interesting subclasses are [[Lie algebra]], [[Jordan algebra]], [[alternative algebra]], [[associative unital algebra]], ...

Mathematicians working in the field of nonassociative algebras often say simply 'algebra' meaning a nonassociative algebra.
