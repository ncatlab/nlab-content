## Definition

Let $k$ be a [[commutative unital ring]], usually a [[field]] (but conceivably even a commutative [[rig]]).

A __nonassociative $k$-algebra__ is a $k$-[[module]] $V$ equipped with a bilinear product $V\otimes V\to V$.

This product is typically neither associative nor unital, although it can be (an example of the [[red herring principle]]).

Mathematicians working in the field of nonassociative algebras often say simply 'algebra' meaning a nonassociative algebra.

## Examples

Some interesting subclasses are [[Lie algebra]], [[Jordan algebra]], [[Leibniz algebra]], [[alternative algebra]], [[associative unital algebra]], [[composition algebra]]...
