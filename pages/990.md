Let $k$ be a commutative unital ring, usually a field.

__Nonassociative $k$-algebra__ is a $k$-module $V$ equipped with a bilinear product $V\otimes V\to V$.

This product is typically (logically speaking not necessarily) neither associative nor unital.

Some interesting subclasses are [[Lie algebra]], [[Jordan algebra]], [[alternative algebra]], [[associative algebra]]...

Mathematicians working in the field of nonassociative algebras often say simply algebra meaning any nonassociative algebra.
