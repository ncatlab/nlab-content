## Definition

An [[object]] $x$ in a category $C$ is said to be **rigid** if its [[automorphism group]] is trivial, in other words if any [[isomorphism]] $f : x \cong x$ must be equal to the [[identity morphism]] $f = 1_x : x \to x$.

## Idea

Certain types of questions (for example, in [[combinatorics]]) are made much more difficult to answer by the presence of non-trivial automorphisms (or "symmetries").  In such settings, sometimes it is helpful to first consider the question for rigid objects, and then try to extend the answer to non-rigid objects.  It can even be useful to artificially "point" or "root" the objects of the original category $C$ by moving to a larger category $C_\bullet$ (with a [[forgetful functor]] $C_\bullet \to C$) in which all objects are rigid.

## Examples

* Any [[initial object]] or [[terminal object]] is rigid.

* In graph theory, a rigid object in the category of undirected [[graphs]] is called an _asymmetric graph_.

* Let $C$ be the category of [[transitive action|transitive]] [[G-sets]] for some group $G$.  Although a transitive $G$-set may in general have non-trivial automorphisms, these symmetries can be killed off by moving to the larger category $C_\bullet$ of _pointed_ transitive $G$-sets, whose objects are pairs of a transitive $G$-set $X$ equipped with an element $r \in X$, and whose morphisms $f : (X,r) \to (Y,s)$ are $G$-equivariant functions $f : X \to Y$ preserving the point $f(r) = s$.  Indeed, suppose $f : (X,r) \to (X,r)$ is any endomorphism of $(X,r)$ (not even assumed to be an isomorphism), and let $x \in X$ be any element.  By the assumption that $G$ acts transitively on $X$, there exists $g \in G$ such that $x = g * r$.  But then by equivariance and preservation of the point we have that
$$f(x) = f(g*r) = g*f(r) = g*r = x.$$
Note that this example is relevant to the combinatorics of [[embedded graphs]] (see [[combinatorial map#rooted_maps]]).
