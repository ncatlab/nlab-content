A **ringoid** is a [[horizontal categorification]] of a [[ring]].  Since a ring is a [[monoid object]] in [[Ab]], or equivalently a one-object category [[enriched category|enriched over]] $Ab$, a ringoid is equivalently a (small) [[Ab-enriched category]].

Ringoids share many of the properties of (noncommutative) rings.  For instance, we can talk about (left and right) modules over a ringoid $R$, which can be defined as Ab-enriched [[functors]] $R\to Ab$ and $R^{op}\to Ab$.  Bimodules over ringoids have a tensor product (the enriched [[tensor product of functors]]) under which they form a [[bicategory]], also known as the bicategory $Ab-Prof$ of $Ab$-enriched [[profunctors]].  Modules over a ringoid also form an [[abelian category]] and thus have a [[derived category]].

One interesting operation on ringoids is the ($Ab$-enriched) [[Cauchy completion]], which is the completion under finite [[direct sums]] and [[split idempotents]].  This is described in more detail at [[Ab-enriched category]].  In particular, the Cauchy completion of a ring $R$ is the category of finitely generated projective $R$-modules (aka split subobjects of finite-rank free modules).  Every ringoid is equivalent to its Cauchy completion in the bicategory $Ab-Prof$, and two ringoids are equivalent in $Ab-Prof$ if and only if their Cauchy completions are equivalent as Ab-enriched categories.  This sort of equivalence is naturally called [[Morita equivalence]].
