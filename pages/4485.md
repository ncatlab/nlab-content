## Definition

A [[differentiable map]] $f : X \to Y$ between two [[manifold]]s is called a _submersion_ precisely if its [[differential]] $d f : T X \to T Y$ is for every point $x \in X$ a [[surjection]] $d f_x : T_x X \to T_{f(x)} Y$.

It is also possible to write a definition that makes no reference to differentials and applies to non-differentiable maps, even between non-differentiable manifolds.

## Properties

While the [[category]] [[Diff]] (finite dimensional) [[smooth manifold]]s does not have all [[pullback]]s,  the [[pullback]] along a submersion always exists. This is because a submersion is [[transverse maps|transversal]] to every other smooth map into its codomain.

The [[surjection|surjective]] submersions (that is the submersions) that are also [[epimorphism]]s in [[Diff]]) are [[regular epimorphism]]s.

Surjective submersions form a singleton [[Grothendieck pretopology]] on [[Diff]], and so may be used in [[internal category|internal]] [[category theory]] when using $Diff$ as the ambient category. They appear notably in the definition of [[Lie groupoid]]s.

[[Ehresmann's theorem]] states that a [[proper morphism|proper]] submersion is a locally trivial [[fibration]].


## Variants

The [[algebraic geometry]] analogue of a submersion is a [[smooth morphism]].
