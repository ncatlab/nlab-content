A _group functor_ is a [[group object]] in a functor category.

## Terminology

The terminology of group-functors is mainly used in the theory of [[algebraic group|algebraic groups]] in algebraic geometry. If $G$ is a group functor the multiplication morphism $\pi:G\times G\to G$ is called _group law on_ $G$. An example of special interest in this context is that of a [[group scheme]].
