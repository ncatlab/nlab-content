## Idea

A Cauchy real number is a [[real number]] that is given as the limit of a [[Cauchy sequence]] of [[rational numbers]].

The idea is due to [[Georg Cantor]] in 1872, the same year that [[Richard Dedekind]] developed [[Dedekind cuts]].


## Definitions

If we simply want a construction of the [[real line]] $\mathbb{R}$ for the purposes of [[classical mathematics]], then we can use Cantor\'s original version.  If we wish to use weak [[foundations]] or [[internalisation|internalise]] the Cauchy real line, then there are subtler alternatives.


### Classical version

Putting Cantor\'s definition in modern terminology, $\mathbb{R}$ is the [[quotient set]] of the set of Cauchy sequences of rational numbers, with two sequences considered equivalent if their difference converges to zero.  Although the notion of Cauchy sequence (and convergence, for that matter) is best known in the context of [[metric spaces]] (which cannot be defined in general without having somehow constructing $\mathbb{R}$ already), it is easy to state the definitions in elementary terms.  If there is any tricky point, it is that the requirements made for all $\epsilon \gt 0$ need be made only for rational $\epsilon$.  (We could also treat $\mathbb{Q}$ as a [[uniform space]] or even a [[Cauchy space]], although again to write down the definitions of those structures still requires one to handle the $\epsilon$s.)

To be explicit:  A __Cantor real number__ $x$ is an [[infinite sequence]] $(x_0,x_1,x_2,\ldots)$ of [[rational numbers]] such that, for every positive rational number $\epsilon$, there exists a [[natural number]] $\alpha$ such that
$$ {|x_i - x_j|} \leq \epsilon $$
holds whenever $i,j \geq \alpha$.  Two Cantor real numbers $x,y$ are considered __equal__ if, for every positive rational number $\epsilon$, there exists a natural number $\alpha$ such that
$$ {|x_i - y_i|} \leq \epsilon $$
holds whenever $i \geq \alpha$.  It is easy to prove that this is an [[equivalence relation]] on the set of Cauchy sequences, so the set $\mathbb{R}$ of real numbers is a quotient set.

This definition comes in two steps: one to identify the Cauchy sequences from among the infinite sequences, another to identify equivalent sequences.  Actually, we can do this in one step by placing a [[partial equivalence relation]] on the set of *all* infinite sequences of rational numbers.  Two sequences $x,y$ are considered equivalent if, for every positive rational number $\epsilon$, there exists a natural number $\alpha$ such that
$$ {|x_i - y_j|} \leq \epsilon $$
holds whenever $i \geq \alpha$.  It is immediate that a sequence $x$ is Cauchy if and only if it equivalent to itself, and it is easy to prove that two Cauchy sequences $x,y$ are equivalent if and only if they are equal as real numbers using the definition above.  Thus, we can construct $\mathbb{R}$ immediately as a [[subquotient]] of the [[function set]] $\mathbb{Q}^{\mathbb{N}}$.


### Moduli of convergence

In weak foundations, we sometimes want to be a little more strict about how a sequence is Cauchy and how the difference of two such sequences converges to zero.  We do this by requiring explicit moduli of convergence.  These moduli can always be constructed using either [[countable choice]] or the principle of [[excluded middle]], but the requirement makes a difference in (for example) a [[localic topos]] over any non-[[discrete space]].

In general, a __[[modulus of convergence]]__ may be any function $\alpha$ from the positive rational numbers to the natural numbers.  A __Cauchy real number__ $x$ is an infinite sequence $(x_0,x_1,x_2,\ldots)$ of rational numbers such that there exists a modulus $\alpha$ such that
$$ {|x_i - x_j|} \leq \epsilon $$
holds whenever $i,j \geq \alpha(\epsilon)$.  Two Cauchy real numbers $x,y$ are considered __equal__ if there exists a modulus $\alpha$ such that
$$ {|x_i - y_i|} \leq \epsilon $$
holds whenever $i \geq \alpha(\epsilon)$.  Again we can combine these conditions into a single partial equivalence relation: that there exists a modulus $\alpha$ such that
$$ {|x_i - y_j|} \leq \epsilon $$
holds whenever $i,j \geq \alpha(\epsilon)$.

Some variations are often met.  A modulus $\alpha$ may be extended to all rational numbers, although the conditions above can only be required for positive $\epsilon$.  Alternatively, it is enough to define $\alpha$ (and require the conditions) for $\epsilon$ of specific form; common choices are $1/n$ and $1/2^n$ for $n$ a natural number.  (The important criterion is to use a set of positive rational numbers of which zero is a limit point.)

It is also possible to fix a specific modulus $\alpha$ ahead of time.  Then we need to treat each index separately, in this way:  An __$\alpha$-regular Cauchy real number__ $x$ is an infinite sequence $(x_0,x_1,x_2,\ldots)$ of rational numbers such that
$$ {|x_i - x_j|} \leq \delta + \epsilon $$
holds whenever $i \geq \alpha(\delta)$ and $j \geq \alpha(\epsilon)$.  Two $\alpha$-regular Cauchy real numbers are considered __equal__ if
$$ {|x_i - y_i|} \leq 2\epsilon $$
holds whenever $i \geq \alpha(\epsilon)$.  Once more, we can combine these conditions into a single partial equivalence relation: that
$$ {|x_i - y_j|} \leq \delta + \epsilon $$
holds whenever $i \geq \alpha(\delta)$ and $j \geq \alpha(\epsilon)$.


### Generalisations

While requiring a modulus of convergence, even fixing the modulus of convergence, may be more restrictive, it is also possible to use a potentially more lax definition.

One way is to use [[nets]] (also called 'generalised sequences').  A __generalised Cauchy real number__ $x$ is a net $(x_\nu)_{\nu\colon D}$ (where $D$ is any [[directed set]] of indices) of rational numbers such that, for every positive rational number $\epsilon$, there exists an index $\alpha$ in $D$ such that
$$ {|x_i - x_j|} \leq \epsilon $$
holds whenever $i,j \geq \alpha$ in $D$.  Two generalised Cauchy real numbers $x,y$ are considered __equal__ if, for every positive rational number $\epsilon$, there exists an index $\alpha$ such that
$$ {|x_i - y_i|} \leq \epsilon $$
holds whenever $i \geq \alpha$.  The partial equivalence relation subsuming both conditions is that, for every positive rational number $\epsilon$, there exists an index $\alpha$ such that
$$ {|x_i - y_j|} \leq \epsilon $$
holds whenever $i,j \geq \alpha$.
A generalised Cauchy real number does not need a modulus of convergence, for reasons that I should probably write about at [[modulus of convergence]].

Another method is to use [[presequences]], which are [[multivalued functions]] from the natural numbers.  A __multivalued Cauchy real number__ $x$ is an [[entire relation]] between natural numbers and rational numbers such that, for every positive rational number $\epsilon$, there exists a natural number $\alpha$ such that, whenever $i, j \geq \alpha$,
$$ {|a - b|} \leq \epsilon $$
holds for some $a,b$ such that $x_{i,a}$ and $x_{j,b}$ hold.  Two multivalued Cauchy real numbers are considered __equal__ if, for every positive rational number $\epsilon$, there exists a natural number $\alpha$ such that, whenever $i \geq \alpha$,
$$ {|a - b|} \leq \epsilon $$
holds for some $a,b$ such that $x_{i,a}$ and $y_{i,b}$ hold. The partial equivalence relation subsuming both conditions is that, for every positive rational number $\epsilon$, there exists a natural number $\alpha$ such that, whenever $i,j \geq \alpha$,
$$ {|a - b|} \leq \epsilon $$
holds for some $a,b$ such that $x_{i,a}$ and $y_{j,b}$.


### Relations between these definitions

Classically, all of these definitions are equivalent.  In fact, to prove their equivalence, we need only [[Fred Richman]]\'s principle of __weak countable choice__:  ...

Consider an [[infinite sequence]] of $(x_1,x_2,x_3,\ldots)$ of [[rational numbers]] such that
$$ {|x_i - x_j|} \lt 1/i + 1/j $$
always holds.  Then we may interpret each $x_i$ as a rational number within $1/i$ of the true value of some real number $x$.  Two such sequences $x,y$ are considered [[equivalence|equivalent]] if
$$ {|x_i - y_j|} \lt 1/i + 1/j $$
always holds; then they represent the same real number.  Up to this equivalence, we can demand that the denominator of $x_i$ is always $i$ (or a factor of $i$), so that $x_i$ is $x$ rounded up or down to the nearest such rational number (in the chosen direction).

Similarly, consider an infinite sequence $(x_0,x_1,x_2,\ldots)$ of rational numbers such that
$$ {|x_i - x_j|} \lt 1/2^i + 1/2^j $$
always holds.  Then we may interpret each $x_i$ as a rational number within $1/10^i$ of the true value of some real number $x$.  Two such sequences $x,y$ are considered equivalent if
$$ {|x_i - y_j|} \lt 1/2^i + 1/2^j $$
always holds.  Up to this equivalence, we can demand that the denominator of $x_i$ is always $10^i$ (or a factor of $10^i$), so that $x_i$ is $x$ rounded up or down to the nearest such rational number (in the chosen direction), that is the nearest rational number with $i$ decimal digits (at most) after the decimal point.

More generally (or a priori more generally), given any __modulus__ $(\alpha_0,\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\ldots)$, which is an infinite sequence of positive rational numbers that diverges to infinity, a __regular Cauchy sequence__ with modulus $\alpha$ is an infinite sequence $(x_0,x_1,x_2,\ldots)$ such that
$$ {|x_i - x_j|} \lt 1/\alpha_i + 1/\alpha_j $$
always holds.  Two such sequences $x,y$ are __regular equivalent__ with modulus $\alpha$ if
$$ {|x_i - y_j|} \lt 1/\alpha_i + 1/\alpha_j $$
always holds.  The previous examples are simply regular Cauchy sequences with modulus $(1,2,3,\ldots)$ or $(1,2,4,\ldots)$, with the appropriate notion of equivalence.

More generally still, given any modulus as above, a __modulated Cauchy sequence__ with modulus $\alpha$ is an infinite sequence $(x_0,x_1,x_2,\ldots)$ such that
$$ {|x_i - x_j|} \lt 1/\alpha_{\min(i,j)} $$
always holds.  Two such sequences $x,y$ are __modulated equivalent__ with modulus $\alpha$ if
$$ {|x_i - y_j|} \lt 2/\alpha_{\min(i,j)} $$
always holds.  Every regular Cauchy sequence with a given modulus is a modulated Cauchy sequence with the same modulus.

Instead of fixing a modulus and considering all infinite sequences satisfying this condition for that modulus, we might consider all moduli at once.  Two modulated Cauchy sequences (possibly with different moduli) will now be considered equivalent in that equivalence is given by *any* modulus.

Most generally of all, we need not specify the modulus as an actual function from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{Q}$ but instead demand that, for each positive rational number $n$ (no matter how large), there exists a [[natural number]] $k$ such that
$$ {|x_i - x_j|} \lt 1/n $$
whenever $i,j \geq k$.  In other words, we consider a __[[Cauchy sequence]]__ of rational numbers.  Similarly, we consider two such sequences __equivalent__ if, for each $n$, there exists $k$ such that
$$ {|x_i - y_i|} \lt 1/n $$
whenever $i \geq k$.

In weak [[foundations]] (including internally to a [[topos]], or even a $\Pi$-[[Pi-pretopos|pretopos]], with [[natural numbers object]]), we can fix any modulus $\alpha$ and then prove that every modulated Cauchy sequence is equivalent to a regular Cauchy sequence with modulus $\alpha$, and also prove that any two modulated Cauchy sequences with given modulus are modulated equivalent if they are equivalent by any modulus (and regualar equivalent if they are also regular).  Thus all the constructions of real numbers in this vein are equivalent if they involve moduli at all.

We would also like to prove that every Cauchy sequence is equivalent to a modulated one, that any two equivalent Cauchy sequences are modulated equivalent, and that any Dedekind real number is represented by a Cauchy sequence.  Each of these results is equivalent to a weak form of [[countable choice]] that also follows from [[excluded middle]].  Thus, almost any foundation used in practice proves these results, but they fail in many [[sheaf topos|sheaf topoi]].  When a distinction must be made, the real numbers represented by modulated Cauchy sequences are called __Cauchy reals__.

We can also use [[nets]] instead of sequences.  In that case, we have that every Dedekind real may be represented by a Cauchy net that is modulated by a net, and that this is unique up to an equivalence modulated by a net, even in weak foundations (in particular, in any $\Pi$-pretopos).  This still will not allow us to fix a modulus in advance, however.
