## Idea

In general, the [[homology]] of a [[point]] is not trivial but is concentrated in degree 0 on the given [[coefficient]] object. For some applications, though, it is convenient to divide out that contribution such as to have the homology of the point be entirely trivial. This is called _reduced homology_.

## Definition

### Reduced singular homology

We discuss the reduced version of [[singular homology]].

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]]. Write $C_\bullet(X)$ for its [[singular chain complex]].

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

The **reduced singular homology** of $X$, denoted $\tilde H_\bullet(X)$, is the [[chain homology]] of the [[augmentation|augmented]] chain complex

$$
  \cdots \to C_2(X) \stackrel{\partial_1}{\to} C_1(X) \stackrel{\partial_0}{\to} C_0(X) \stackrel{\epsilon}{\to}
  \mathbb{Z} \to 0
  \,,
$$

where the **augmentation map** $\epsilon$ adds the [[coefficients]] of all 0-chains:

$$
  \epsilon \colon \colon \sum_{i} n_i \sigma_i \mapsto \sum_i n_i
  \,.
$$

### For singular homology

For $X$ a [[topological space]], write $H_n(X)$ for its [[singular homology]] with integer coefficients.

###### Example

If $X$ is a [[contractible topological space]], then for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$

$$
  \tilde H_n(X) \simeq 0
  \,.
$$

###### Example

The reduced singular homology of the 0-[[sphere]] $S^0 \simeq {*} \coprod {*}$ is

$$
  \tilde H_n(S^0) \simeq 
  \left\{
    \array{
       \mathbb{Z} & if \; n = 0
       \\
       0 & otherwise
    }
  \right.
  \,.
