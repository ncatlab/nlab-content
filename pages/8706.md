## Idea

In general, the [[homology]] of a [[point]] is not trivial but is concentrated in degree 0 on the given [[coefficient]] object. For some applications, though, it is convenient to divide out that contribution such as to have the homology of the point be entirely trivial. This is called _reduced homology_.

## Definition

### Reduced singular homology

We discuss the reduced version of [[singular homology]].

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]]. Write $C_\bullet(X)$ for its [[singular chain complex]].

###### Definition

The **reduced singular homology** of $X$, denoted $\tilde H_\bullet(X)$, is the [[chain homology]] of the [[augmentation|augmented]] chain complex

$$
  \cdots \to C_2(X) \stackrel{\partial_1}{\to} C_1(X) \stackrel{\partial_0}{\to} C_0(X) \stackrel{\epsilon}{\to}
  \mathbb{Z} \to 0
  \,,
$$

where the **augmentation map** $\epsilon$ adds the [[coefficients]] of all 0-chains:

$$
  \epsilon \colon \colon \sum_{i} n_i \sigma_i \mapsto \sum_i n_i
  \,.
$$
