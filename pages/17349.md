# Surjective on objects functors

## Idea

A [[functor]] $F:C\to D$ is **surjective on objects** if for each object $y\in D$ there is an object $x\in C$ such that $F(x)=y$.

This is of course [[evil|not an invariant notion]]; the corresponding invariant notion is [[essentially surjective functor]].  However, surjective-on-objects functors are sometimes useful when doing [[strict 2-category]] theory.

## Properties

Surjective-on-objects functors are the left class in an [[orthogonal factorization system]] on [[Cat]] whose right class consists of the injective-on-objects and [[fully faithful functors]].
