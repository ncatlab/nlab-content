## Idea 

In enumerative [[combinatorics]], a "bijective proof" refers to a basic method of counting the number of structures of a certain type supported on a finite set of underlying points, by analyzing structure in two different ways. It is really a special case of "[[categorification]]": an identity $a = b$ where $a$ and $b$ are [[natural number]] expressions is proved by taking underlying cardinalities of a [[bijection]] $A \cong B$ between sets of structures, hence the name. (If taking cardinalities is an example of "decategorifying", then going the other way from $a = b$ to $A \cong B$ would be "categorifying" or promoting an equation to an isomorphism.) 

In some sense this is what the theory of [[species]] is all about: formalizing the operations adhering to bijective proofs. Often bijective proofs give an impression of elegance or enlightenment: rather than prove natural number or polynomial identities through acts of symbolic manipulation, one *sees* the identity by drawing pictures of structures that the two sides of the identity are counting. 

## Examples 

For the moment we'll just jot down some possible examples for illustrating the method; these are to be filled in later, or to be linked to other nLab articles where the bijective proof is given. 

* Binomial identity 

* $q$-binomial identity 

* Counting trees: Cayley's theorem 

* Vandermonde identity 

* Stirling number identities 

## Polynomial identities 

One method for proving [[polynomial]] identities (equations $p = q$ between polynomials $p, q \in \mathbb{C}[x_1, \ldots, x_k]$ in several variables) is first to give a bijective proof for the special case in which natural numbers $m_i$ are substituted for the variables $x_i$, and then reason that there are enough natural numbers that the polynomial identity must hold generally. 

More formally, two polynomials are equal, $p(x_1, \ldots, x_k) = q(x_1, \ldots, x_k)$, if $p(m_1, \ldots, m_k) = q(m_1, \ldots, m_k)$ for all choices of natural numbers $m_i$. Relatedly, the set $\mathbb{N}^k \subseteq \mathbb{C}^k$ is Zariski-dense (i.e., the closure of $\mathbb{N}^k$ in $\mathbb{C}^k$ equipped with the [[Zariski topology]] is all of $\mathbb{C}^k$). 

This is intuitively obvious of course. As a public service, we prove a more general result.

###### Proposition 
Suppose $B$ is an [[infinite set|infinite]] [[subset]] of an [[integral domain]] $A$. Then a polynomial $p(x_1, \ldots, x_k) \in A[x_1, \ldots, x_k]$ is uniquely determined by its values it takes at arguments $b_1, \ldots, b_k \in B$.

###### Proof 
It suffices to show that if $p(b_1, \ldots, b_k) = 0$ for every choice of $b_i \in B$, then $p = 0$. We prove this by induction on $k$. The case $k = 0$ is trivial. 

Assuming the assertion as induction hypothesis for case $k$, suppose $p \in A[x_1, \ldots, x_k, x_{k+1}]$ satisfies $p(b_1, \ldots, b_k, b) = 0$ for all choices $b_i \in B$ and $b \in B$. Then by induction, for each fixed $b \in B$ the polynomial $p(x_1, \ldots, x_k, b) \in A[x_1, \ldots, x_k]$ is identically zero. Thus if $F$ is the [[field of fractions]] of $A[x_1, \ldots, x_k]$, and if we regard $p$ as an element of the [[Euclidean domain]] $F[x_{k+1}]$ under the obvious embedding 

$$A[x_1, \ldots, x_k, x_{k+1}] \cong A[x_1, \ldots, x_k][x_{k+1}] \hookrightarrow F[x_{k+1}],$$ 

then $p$ has infinitely many [[roots]] $b$ in $A$ and thus in $F$, forcing $p$ to be identically zero.
