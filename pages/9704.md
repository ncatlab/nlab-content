## Cosmic monopoles


In a [[gauge theory]] with a degenerate [[vacuum]] (such as when a [[Higgs mechanism]] applies), the [[moduli space]] of [[vacua]] is the [[quotient]] $G/H$ (the [[coset]]) of the [[gauge group]] $G$ by the [[stabilizer subgroup]] $H \hookrightarrow G$ of any of these vacua ([[spontaneous symmetry breaking]]).

This means that gauge equivalence classes of vaccum configurations on a [[spacetime]] $X$ are given by [[homotopy]] classes of maps $X \to \Pi(G/H)$ (where the notation on the right denotes the underlying [[homotopy type]] of the [[coset]] space, $\Pi$ is the [[shape modality]]).

If [[spacetime]] is locally to be taken of the form $\mathbb{R} \times (\mathbb{R}^3 - D^3 \times \mathbb{R}^0)$, hence with a 3-dimensional ball-like piece taken out, them homotopy classes of maps $X \to \Pi(G/H)$ are classified by the second [[homotopy group]] $\pi_2(G/H)$. For a given nontrivial element here the correponding [[vacuum]] is said to contain a **cosmic monopole defect**. ("Cosmic" just because this effect is thought to be most relevant on scales of [[cosmology]].)

In other words this means that the vacuum strcture changes continuously as one moves around the string, but has a [[singularity]] on the locus of the string itself.
