#Preliminaries#

Let $K$ be a [[category]] and write $arr(K)$ for the [[arrow category]] of $K$: the category with arrows (= [[morphisms]]) $a \stackrel{f}{\to} b$ of $K$ as objects and commutative squares $g u=v f$ 

$$
  \array{
    a &\stackrel{u}{\to}& c
    \\
    \downarrow^f
    &&
    \downarrow^g
    \\
   b &\stackrel{v}{\to}& d    
  }
$$

as morphisms $(u,v) : f \rightarrow g$. We may also refer to a commutative square $g u=v f$ as a **lifting problem** between $f$ and $g$.

We say a morphism $f$ has the **left lifting property** with respect to a morphism $g$, or equivalently that $g$ has the **right lifting property** with respect to $f$, if for every commutative square $(u,v) :f \rightarrow g$ as above,  there is an arrow $\gamma$ 

$$
  \array{
    a &\stackrel{u}{\to}& c
    \\
    \downarrow^f
    &{}^{\exists \gamma}\nearrow&
    \downarrow^g
    \\
   b &\stackrel{v}{\to}& d    
  }
$$


from the codomain $b$ of $f$ to the domain $c$ of $g$ such that both triangles commute. We call such an arrow $\gamma$ a **lift** or a **solution** to the lifting problem $(u,v)$.

#Definition#

A **weak factorization system** on a category $K$ is a pair $(L, R)$ of classes of morphisms such that

(i) Every morphism $f$ of $K$ can be factored as $f=r l$ with $l \in L$ and $r \in R$.

(ii) $L$ is the class of morphisms which have the left lifting property with respect to every morphism of $R$.

(iii) $R$ is the class of morphisms which have the right lifting property with respect to every morphism of $L$.

#Orthogonal Factorization Systems#

An **[[orthogonal factorization system]]** is a weak factorization system where we additionally require that the solutions to each lifting problem be _unique_.

While every OFS is evidently a WFS, the primary examples of each are different.  A "basic example" of an OFS is (epi, mono) in [[Set]] (meaning $L$ is the collection of [[epimorphisms]] and $R$ that of [[monomorphisms]]), while a "basic example" of a WFS is (mono, epi) in $Set$.  The superficial similarity of these two examples masks the fact that they generalize in very different ways.  The OFS (epi, mono) generalizes to any [[topos]] or [[pretopos]], and in fact to any [[regular category]] if we replace "epi" with [[regular epimorphism|regular epi]].  Likewise it generalizes to any [[quasitopos]] if we instead replace "mono" with [[regular monomorphism|regular mono]].

On the other hand, saying that (mono,epi) is a WFS in $Set$ is equivalent to the [[axiom of choice]].  A less loaded statement is that $(L,R)$ is a WFS, where $L$ is the class of inclusions $A\hookrightarrow A\sqcup B$ into a binary coproduct and $R$ is the class of [[split epimorphism|split epis]].  In this form the statement generalizes to any [[extensive category]].

#Examples#

* [[model category|Model categories]] provide many examples of weak factorization systems.  In fact, most applications of WFS involve model categories or model-categorical ideas.

#Properties#

* The classes $(L,R)$ of a weak factorization system enjoy many good closure properties. Both are closed under [[retracts]] and contain all [[isomorphisms]]. $L$ is closed under [[pushouts]] and $R$ is closed under [[pullbacks]]. $L$ is closed under arbitrary [[coproducts]] and $R$ is closed under arbitrary [[products]]. $L$ is also closed under [[transfinite composition]]. The closure properties for $L$ can be summarized by saying that $L$ is **saturated**, which means precisely this.

* However, $L$ is not closed under all [[colimits]] in $arr(K)$ and similarly $R$ is not closed under all [[limits]] in $arr(K)$; they are not necessarily closed under ([[coequalizer|co]])[[equalizers]]. However, if $(L,R)$ is an _orthogonal_ factorzation system, then $L$ is closed under all colimits and $R$ is closed under all limits.

#Functorial Factorization#

The precise requirements for a factorization of morphisms to be _functorial_ are frequently misstated. What follows is a fairly uncommon (but correct) definition:

Write $[2]$ and $[3]$ for the [[ordinal numbers]], regarded as categories. So $arr(K)$ is isomorphic to the functor category $[[2],K]$. There are three injective functors $[2] \rightarrow [3]$; let $d_1$ be the functor that sends the objects $\{0,1\}$ of $[2]$ to the objects $\{0,2\}$ of $[3]$. This induces a functor $c : [[3],K] \rightarrow [[2],K]$ which can be thought of as "composition."

A **functorial factorization** is a functor $F : [[2],K] \rightarrow [[3],K]$ such that $c F$ is the identity on $arr(K)$.  Not all weak factorization systems are functorial, although most (including those produced by the [[small object argument]]) are, but all orthogonal ones are automatically functorial.


#Detail#

We give the details of the proof that morphisms defined by a right lifting property are stable under pullback.

###### Lemma


$R$ is preserved under [[pullback]].

This is for instance lemma 7.2.11 in

* Hirschhorn, _Model categories and their localization_ .

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


Let $p : X \to Y$ be in $R$ and and let 

$$
  \array{
    Z \times_f X &\to& X
    \\
    \downarrow^{f^* p} && \downarrow^p
    \\
    Z &\stackrel{f}{\to} & Y 
  }
$$

be a [[pullback]] diagram. We need to show that $f^* p$ has the right lifting property with respect to all $i : A \to B$ in $L$. So let

$$
  \array{
     A &\to& Z \times_f X
     \\
     \downarrow^i && \downarrow^{f^* p}
     \\
     B &\stackrel{g}{\to}& Z
  }
$$

be any commuting square. We need to construct a diagonal lift of that square. To that end, first compose with the pullback square from above to obtain the commuting diagram

$$
  \array{
     A &\to& Z \times_f X &\to& X
     \\
     \downarrow^i && \downarrow^{f^* p} 
     && \downarrow^p
     \\
     B &\stackrel{g}{\to}& Z &\stackrel{f}{\to}& Y
  }
  \,.
$$

By the right lifting property of $p$, there is a diagonal lift of the total outer diagram

$$
  \array{
    A &\to& X
    \\
    \downarrow^i &{}^{\hat {(f g)}}\nearrow&  \downarrow^p
    \\
    B &\stackrel{f g}{\to}& Y
  }
  \,.
$$

By the [[pullback]] property this gives rise to the lift $\hat g$ in

$$
  \array{
     && Z \times_f X &\to& X
     \\
     &{}^{\hat g} \nearrow& \downarrow^{f^* p} 
     && \downarrow^p
     \\
     B &\stackrel{g}{\to}& Z &\stackrel{f}{\to}& Y
  }
  \,.
$$

In order for $\hat g$ to qualify as the intended lift
of the total diagram, it remains to show that 

$$
  \array{
     A &\to& Z \times_f X
     \\
     \downarrow^i & {}^{\hat g}\nearrow
     \\
     B
  }
$$

commutes. To do so we notice that we obtain two pullback [[cones]] with tip $A$:

* one is given by the morphisms 
  1. $A \to Z \times_f X \to X$
  2. $A \stackrel{i}{\to} B \stackrel{g}{\to} Z$

  with universal morphism into the pullback being

  * $A \to Z \times_f X$

* the other by
  1. $A \stackrel{i}{\to} B \stackrel{\hat g}{\to} Z \times_f X \to X$
  2. $A \stackrel{i}{\to} B \stackrel{g}{\to} Z$.
  
  with universal morphism into the pullback being
  
  * $A \stackrel{i}{\to} B \stackrel{\hat g}{\to} Z \times_f X$.

The commutativity of the diagrams that we have established so far shows that the first and second morphisms here equal each other, respectively. By the fact that the universal morphism into a pullback diagram is _unique_ this implies the required identity of morphisms.
