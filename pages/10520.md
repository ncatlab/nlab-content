## Definition ##

A **submonoid** of a [[monoid]] $M$ with unit $1$ is a subset $N$ of $M$ containing $1$ which is also a monoid with respect to the inherited multiplication.

## Examples ##

* Given a group $G$, any subgroup is a submonoid.
* Given a category $C$ and a subcategory $D$, an object $X$ in both, the monoid $\Hom_D(X,X)$ is a submonoid of $\Hom_C(X,X)$.
* A [[commutative]] monoid $M$ is a submonoid of its [[Grothendieck group]] $G(M)$.
