__Михаил Михайлович Постников__, (that is _Mihail Mihajlovič Postnikov_ (in a slavistic transliteration as in G. Shevelov, A prehistory of Slavic, Columbia 1965) or _Mikhail Mikhailovich Postnikov_) is a former Russian (Soviet) topologist (27.10.1927--27.5.2004) and a professor at MGU until his sudden death.

There is no one 'standard' Slavic transliteration into English.  (Maybe there should be, but there isn\'t.)  The closest to a universal standard is (I think) ISO9, but that is language-dependent and doesn\'t match either transliteration above for Russian.  (See [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Russian) for discussion of several methods.)  ---Toby

If one uses word TRANSLITERATION that means letter for letter; thus all nonbijections are EXLUDED. For example,
using y both for hard i and for the liquid j. The transliteration was standard BEFORE the computer era, for example is the libraries of Soviet Union and in Slavistic jornals and textbooks like the one above. My librarian in Croatia for example would NEVER make a mistake. Another thing is America where the Russian emigracy tried to make spellings to fit the American-English ear and invented things like KH (two letters for one in cyrillic) and made nonbijective things like with hard i/j merger, and neglected hard sign and so on; French and German did similar francophone adaptation resulting in Gourevich for (ou for u) and Gurevitsch (=4 letters for ч). These are all not accepted by the librarian systems in Russia and Eastern Europe where they are pretty homogeneous. I do not consider the computer era additions (when the literacy sensibility went down in comparison to library period very relavant. For example ISO9 you mention uses for Serbian nonstandard 
signs in order to have compatibility of many languages at the same time, while every child in Serbia knows how to write their cyrillic into latinic with 1-1 correspondence.
I also did not say "transliteration into English" as this makes no sense, transliteration is about letter signs not meaning, syntax etc. and language includes meaning and syntax. I meant Slavic-style transliteration standard into Latinic script; as all slavic languages with latinic standard (Czech, Slovak, Slovene, Croatian, Polish...) use the diacritics, I assume the diacritics are used (unlike in English alphabet) j is glide sound but x, w are not used. But for hard i one uses y, in most transliterations, including the slavic standard like in the book above.

_Toby_:  Zoran, there *are* no bijections between the Latin and Cyrillic alphabets; they have different cardinalities.

An injection from Cyrillic strings to Latin strings is all that you really need, and that doesn\'t rule out using 'H' as a modifier.  OK, you can increase the cardinality of the Latin alphabet by including letters with diacritics, but this clashes with diacritics on the Cyrillic letters!  Then there is the cold fact that Serbocratian, the one language that is (or was) widely used in both scripts, does *not* use an injection from Cyrillic strings to Latin strings (as 'DZH' may be 'ДЖ' or 'Џ' and 'DZ' may be 'ДЗ' or 'Ѕ'), contrary to what you said 'every child in Serbia' knows.  (Of course, for *practical* purposes, this system is perfectly good.  A modifier 'H' is also perfectly good for practical purposes, even one also uses 'H' for 'Х' or 'Г'.)  Not to mention all of the non-Slavic languages that were given Cyrillic scripts in the Soviet era and now have their own Latin scripts.  The sad fact is that there is no single transliteration systems that works for all purposes.

It should be no surprise that different transliteration systems are used for different languages (source or target) with the same scripts.  While languages do *include* such irrelevant features as meaning and syntax, that is not *all* that they are (besides the script itself).  English doesn\'t like diacritics as much as many other languages with the Latin script, Ukrainian and Serbian have very different traditions when it comes to 'H', and so on.  But no matter; I\'m happy to generalise from the English language to the Latin script if you like, as it can only strengthen my case there is no single standard that works for all purposes.

Please don\'t get me wrong; I *like* slavistic transliteration.  I wish that it were more widely used, and I wish that it worked for everything.  And I don\'t mind at all that you use it here.  I only object to the claim that it is the (or the only) standard, or the claim (which I don\'t think that you have made) that anything else is wrong.

His thesis under the mentorship of [[L S Pontrjagin|L. S. Pontrjagin]] ([ru.wiki](http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Понтрягин,_Лев_Семёнович)), contained a construction of a homotopical decomposition of a topological space into a tower of [[fibration]]s (now called a [[Postnikov tower]]) and cohomological invariants ([[Postnikov invariant]]s) which together with the tower form a "system" ([[Postnikov system]]). The use of these data enabled him to effectively encode the full [[homotopy type]] of a space. 

After his early work, Postnikov dedicated himself to teaching, leading a famous seminar at MGU, and advising students (among most successful of his students is Rudyak) and largely neglected his own research. As a clear and superb lecturer, he also wrote several volumes of advanced textbooks in geometry and topology, and a booklet on Galois theory. Unfortunately, he also dedicated much of his efforts and time to an alternative history, considered pseudoscience by the mainstream. Some of his mathematical memoirs may be found in the book _Golden Years of Moscow Mathematics_, by Smilka Zdravkovska (AMS, 2nd ed. 2007).
