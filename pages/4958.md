## Idea

The analog in the context of [[(∞,1)-topos]] theory of a [[local geometric morphism]] in [[topos theory]].


## Definition

A **local geometric morphism** $f : E \to S$ between [[(∞,1)-topos]]es $\mathbf{H},\mathbf{S}$ is 

* a [[geometric morphism]]

  $$
    (f^* \dashv f_*) 
     : 
      \mathbf{H} \stackrel{\overset{f^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{f_*}
    {\to}}  \mathbf{S}
  $$

* such that a further [[right adjoint]] $f^! : \mathbf{S} \to \mathbf{H}$ exists:

  $$
    (f^* \dashv f_* \dashv f^!) : 
    \mathbf{H}
     \stackrel{\overset{f^*}{\leftarrow}}{\stackrel{\underset{f_*}{\to}}{\underset{f^!}{\leftarrow}}}
    \mathbf{S}
  $$

* and such that some additional condition is satisfied.  See [[local geometric morphism]] for a list of equivalent conditions in the 1-categorical case; one or more of them should appear here.  (However, one may expect them to be redundant when $S=\infty Gpd$, just as they are redundant in the 1-categorical case when $S=Set$.)

If $f : \mathbf{H} \to \mathbf{S}$ is the [[global section]] geometric morphism in the category of $(\infty,1)$toposes over $\mathbf{S}$, then we say that $\mathbf{H}$ is a **local $(\infty,1)$-topos**.
