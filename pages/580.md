## Definition

An __extremal epimorphism__ (also sometimes called a _[[cover]]_) in a [[category]] $C$ is a [[morphism]] $e$ such that if $e = m \circ g$ where $m$ is a [[monomorphism]], then $m$ is an [[isomorphism]].

The dual notion is an __extremal monomorphism__: a morphism $m$ such that if $m = g \circ e$ where $e$ is an [[epimorphism]], then $e$ is an isomorphism.

Despite the terminology, it is not necessarily true that an extremal epimorphism is in fact an [[epimorphism]], so sometimes this is required as well (and dually for extremal monomorphisms).  On the other, this does often follow, as in the first remark below.


## Remarks

* If $C$ has all [[equalizers]], then any extremal epimorphism must actually be an [[epimorphism]].

* Any [[strong epimorphism]] is extremal.  The converse is true if $C$ has all [[pullbacks]].

* Any [[regular epimorphism]] is strong, and hence extremal.  The converse is true if $C$ is [[regular category|regular]].

* An [[image|image factorization]] of a morphism $f$ is, by definition, a factorization $f = m \circ e$ where $m$ is a [[monomorphism]] and $e$ is an extremal epimorphism.

Of course, the dual properties are all true of extremal monomorphisms.  (See [[coequalizer]], [[monomorphism]], [[strong monomorphism]], [[pushout]], [[regular monomorphism]], [[coregular category]], [[coimage factorization]], [[epimorphism]].)
