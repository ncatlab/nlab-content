# Definition #

An **extremal epimorphism** (also called a **cover**) in a [[category]] $C$ is an [[epimorphism]] $e$ such that if $e = m g$ where $m$ is a [[monomorphism]], then $m$ is an isomorphism.

The dual notion is an **extremal monomorphism**.

# Remarks #

* If $C$ has [[equalizer]]s, then any morphism with the property above must automatically be an epimorphism.

* Any [[strong epimorphism]] is extremal.  The converse is true if $C$ has [[pullback]]s.

* Any [[regular epimorphism]] is strong, and hence extremal.  The converse is true if $C$ is [[regular category|regular]].

* An [[image|image factorization]] of a morphism $f$ is, by definition, a factorization $f= m e$ where $m$ is a monomorphism and $e$ is an extremal epimorphism.
