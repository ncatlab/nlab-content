While an [[[[algebraic definition of higher category|algebraic]] definition of [[strict omega-category|strict omega-categories]] is comparatively straightforward, algebraic definitions of fully weak $\omega$-categories are difficult to work with (although they do definitions exist, such as those of Batanin, Leinster, and Penon).

Howver, just like strict $\omega$-categories have a [[simplicial set|simplicial]] [[nerve]] -- a [[complicial set]] -- induced by the [[oriental]]s, and just like the category of strict $\omega$-categories is equivalent to the category of complicial sets, one expects that every weak $\omega$-category naturally has a simplicial nerve and that the theory of algebraically defined weak $\omega$-categories is equivalent to the theory of the simplicial sets that arise as their nerves.  In fact, one can hope that the theory is _simpler_ in the weak case: complicial sets are simplicial sets equipped with extra [[stuff, structure, property|structure]] (a [[stratified simplicial set|stratification]] representing the chosen 'strict' composites), while in the nerve of a weak $\omega$-category this structure might be reducible to a property.

In the context of _simplicial models for weak $\omega$-categories_ the goal is to characterize those [[simplicial set]]s (or [[stratified simplicial set]]s) which should arise as [[nerve]]s of algebraically defined weak $\omega$-categories and thus provide a [[geometric definition of higher category]] generalizing the familiar simplicial description of [[infinity-groupoid]]s as [[Kan complex]]es and of [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categories]] as [[quasi-category|quasi-categories]] to general higher categories.

In effect, the goal is to _define_ a weak $\omega$-category to be a certain sort of ([[stratified simplicial set|stratified]]) simplicial set.  One could then hope to prove that these are precisely the [[nerve|nerves]] of weak $\omega$-categories defined in some other way.


To distinguish the study of weak $\omega$-categories in terms of their presumed nerves from the study of their would-be algebraic descriptions people speak of [[simplicial weak omega-category|simplicial weak omega-categories]], see in particular the articles by Dominic Verity referenced below.  One should just beware that in this context [[simplicial weak omega-category]] is not meant as [[simplicial object]] in the category of weak $\omega$-categories.

This program was originally begun by Ross Street and has been carried forward by Dominic Verity with the theory of [[weak complicial set]]s.  It is expected that the (nerves of) weak $\omega$-categories will be weak complicial sets satisfying an extra "saturation" condition ensuring that "every [[equivalence]] is [[thin element|thin]]."

Discussion on a previous version of this entry:

[[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: This term is kind of unfortunate; *simplicial weak $\omega$-category* could also mean a simplicial object in weak $\omega$-categories.  I don't suppose we can do anything about that?

[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: my impression is that what Dominic Verity mainly wants to express with the term is "simplicial model for weak $\omega$-category". Maybe we could/should use a longer phrase like that?

[[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: That would make me happier.

[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: okay, I changed it. Let me know if this is good now.

_Toby_:  But what about 'globular $\omega$-category' and things like that?  Doesn\'t 'simplicial $\omega$-category' fit right into that framework?  This page title sounds like an entire framework for defining $\omega$-category rather than a single $\omega$-category simplicially defined.

[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: i am open to suggestions -- but notice that it does indeed seem to me that Dominic Verity wants to express  "an entire framework for defining $\omega$-category", namely the framework where one skips over the attempt to define $\omega$-categories and instead tries to find a characterization of what should be their nerves.

_Toby_:  OK, that fits in with most of what\'s written here, but not the beginning
>**Simplicial models for weak $\omega$-categories** -- sometimes called [[simplicial weak omega-category|simplicial weak omega-categories]] -- are [...]
Maybe that was just poorly written, but it threw me off.
Should it be
>A **simplicial model for weak $\omega$-categories** -- which are then sometimes called [[simplicial weak omega-category|simplicial weak omega-categories]] -- is [...]
or even
>A **simplicial model for weak $\omega$-categories** is [...]
and only later mention [[simplicial weak omega-category|simplicial weak omega-categories]]?

[[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: You're right that 'simplicial $\omega$-category' it fits into 'globular $\omega$-category' and 'opetopic $\omega$-category' and so on.  It seems more problematic in this case, though, since simplicial objects of random categories are a good deal more prevalent than globular ones and opetopic ones.  But perhaps I should just live with it.  

[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: I have now expanded the entry text on this point, trying to make very clear to the reader what's going on here.
