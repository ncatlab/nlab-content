
In [[field theory]] one speaks of _Euclidean field theory_ if the underlying [[spaces]] on which the [[field (physics)|fields]] are defined are [[Riemannian manifolds]], as opposed to [[Lorentzian  manifold|Lorentian]] [[spacetimes]] used in [[relativistic field theory]]. Hence in Euclidean field theory there is no "[[time]]", one may understand this as essentially being [[statistical mechanics]]. 

In good situations [[Wick rotation]] relates Euclidean field theory with [[relativistic field theory]].
