A [[topos]] is _localic_ if it is generated under [[colimit]]s by the [[subobject]]s of its [[terminal object]].

#Examples#

Every [[Grothendieck topos]] that is a [[category of sheaves]] on (the [[category of open subsets]] of) a [[topological space]] is localic. 

# Generalizations #

In the context of [[(∞,1)-topos]] [[Higher Topos Theory|theory]] there is a notion of [[n-localic (∞,1)-topos]].
