## Definition

For $C$ a [[coherent category]] $C$ the **coherent coverage** on $C$ is the [[coverage]] in which the [[covering]] families are generated by finite, jointly [[regular epimorphism|regular-epimorphic]] families.


The corresponding [[Grothendieck topology]] is called the **coherent topology**.

Equivalently, this is generated by single [[regular epimorphisms]] and by finite [[union]]s of [[subobject]]s.  

Topoi of sheaves for coherent topologies on coherent categories are called [[coherent topos|coherent toposes]].  (The terminology is slightly confusing, though, because every topos is a coherent category.)


## Properties

The coherent coverage is [[subcanonical site|subcanonical]]. 

* If $C$ is [[extensive category|extensive]], then its coherent topology is generated by the [[regular topology]] together with the [[extensive topology]].  (In fact, the coherent topology is [[superextensive site|superextensive]].)

* If $C$ is a [[pretopos]], then its self-indexing is a [[stack]] for its coherent topology.  Exactness and extensivity are stronger than necessary, however; a pair of necessary and sufficient conditions for this to hold are that

  1. If $R\;\rightrightarrows\; A$ is a kernel pair, then for any $f\colon B\to A$, the pullback $f^*R \;\rightrightarrows\; B$ is also a kernel pair (this is equivalent to the [[codomain fibration]] being a stack for the regular topology).
  1. If $A,B \rightarrowtail C$ are a pair of subobjects, then for any $f\colon X\to A$ and $g\colon Y\to B$ and any isomorphism $f^*(A\cap B) \cong g^*(A\cap B)$, the pushout
    $$\array{f^*(A\cap B) & \overset{}{\to} & X\\
    \downarrow && \downarrow\\
    Y& \underset{}{\to} & Z}$$
    exists and is also a pullback.
