## Idea 

A [[topological space]] $X$, or rather its [[homotopy type]], is called _simple_ if

1. the [[fundamental group]] $\pi_1(X)$ is [[abelian group|abelian]];

1. its canonical [[action]] on all higher [[homotopy groups]] $\pi_{\bullet \geq 2}(X)$ is trivial.

## Examples

* Every [[connected topological space|connected]] [[H-space]] is nilpotent

and thus, in particular,

* every [[loop space]] is nilpotent 

  (since all its [[connected components]] are [[homotopy equivalence|homotopy equivalent]] to the unit component, which is a connected H-space).

## Properties

Simple spaces are also [[nilpotent spaces]] ([May-Ponto 12, p. 49 (77 of 542)](#MayPonto12)).
