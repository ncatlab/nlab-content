Let $I = [0.1]$ be the closed unit interval with the standard topology. A [[topological space]] is __binormal__ if $X\times I$ is a [[normal topological space]] (satisfies [[separation axiom]]s $T_4$ and $T_1$). 

Exercise I.B2 in Spanier: If $X$ is a binormal space, $Y$ a normal space and $f:X\to Y$ continuous, 
the [[mapping cylinder]] of $f$ is a normal space. 

__Borsuk-s homotopy extension theorem__. (Exercise I.D2 in Spanier) Let $A$ be a closed subspace of a binormal space $X$. Then $(X,A)$ has the homotopy extension property with respect to any absolute neighborhood retract $Y$.
