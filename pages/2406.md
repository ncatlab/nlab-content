[Arnold Neumaier](
http://arnold-neumaier.at)

I am interested in the foundations of mathematics
(building an automatic mathematical research system),
the foundations of theoretical physics (interpretation 
of quantum mechanics and statistical physics),
and in applied mathematics of all sorts (from protein folding 
to cattle breeding to uncertainty modeling in space system design). 

I wrote books on topics in finite geometry, numerical analysis, and Lie algebras (different ones for each of 
these subjects).

## Publications
