A (binary) [[relation]] $\sim$ on a set $A$ is __transitive__ if in every chain of $3$ pairwise related elements, the first and last elements are also related:
$$\forall (x, y, z: A),\; x \sim y \;\wedge\; y \sim z \;\Rightarrow\; x \sim z$$
which generalises from $3$ to any finite, positive number of elements.

In the language of the $2$-poset [[Rel]] of sets and relations, a relation $R: A \to A$ is __transitive__ if it contains its composite with itself:
$$R^2 \subseteq R$$
from which it follows that $R^n \subseteq R$ for any positive [[natural number]] $n$.  To include the case where $n = 0$, we must explicitly state that the relation is [[reflexive relation|reflexive]].

Transitive relations are often understood as [[orders]].
