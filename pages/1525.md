There are several concepts often called a **path category**.

## Free category on a directed graph

There is a [[forgetful functor]] from [[small category|small]] [[strict category|strict]] [[categories]] to [[quivers]]. This forgetful functor has a [[left adjoint]], giving the **free category** or **path category** of a quiver, whose [[objects]] are the vertices of the quiver.  The [[morphisms]] from $a$ to $b$ in this free category are *not* merely the arrows from $a$ to $b$ in the quiver but instead are [[lists]] of the form $(a_n,f_n,a_{n-1},\ldots,a_{1},f_1,a_0)$ where $n \geq 0$ is a [[natural number]], $a_0,a_1,\ldots,a_n$ are vertices of the graph, $a = a_0$, $b = a_n$,  and for all $0 \lt i \leq n$, $f_i\colon a_{i-1} \to a_i$ is an edge from $a_{i-1}$ to $a_i$.  The [[composition]] is given by the concatenation 
$$(a_n,f_n,a_{n-1},\ldots,a_{1},f_1,a_0)\circ (b_m,g_m,a_{m-1},\ldots,b_{1},g_1,b_0) := (a_n,f_n,a_{n-1},\ldots,a_{1},f_1,a_0= b_m,g_m,a_{m-1},\ldots,b_{1},g_1,b_0)$$ 
whenever $a_0 = b_m$, and the [[target]] and [[source]] maps are given by $s(a_n,f_n,a_{n-1},\ldots,a_{1},f_1,a_0)=a_0$ and $t(a_n,f_n,a_{n-1},\ldots,a_{1},f_1,a_0) = a_n$. One informally writes $f$ for the morphism $(b,f,a)\colon a \to b$ in the free category and the [[identity morphism|identities]] of the free category are $id_a = (a,a)$; thus $f_n \circ f_{n-1} \circ \ldots \circ f_1 = (t(f_n),f_n,t(f_{n-1}),\ldots,t(f_1),f_1,s(f_1))$. The standard reference is [[Gabrielâ€“Zisman]] who call it the category of paths. It occurs at various places in their dictionary with the definition right on page 1. More elaborate discussions of the free category can be found in [MacLane](#MacLane), Borceux vol.1, or [Barr-Wells](#BarrWells). Related things are done with free cats with extra-structure and their path categories by [Walters1](#Walters1) and [Walters2](#Walters2) and by [Latch](#Latch) here. All three concern context free grammars.


## Path category of a space

Given a [[topological space]] $X$ (or some other kind of [[space]] with a notion of maps from [[intervals]] into it), there are various ways to obtain a [[small category|small]] [[strict category|strict]] [[category]] whose objects are the points of $X$ and whose morphisms are [[paths]] in $X$. This is also often called a _path category_.

* In particular, for every topological space there is its [[fundamental groupoid]] whose morphisms are [[homotopy]] classes of paths in $X$.

* If $X$ is a [[directed space]] there is a notion of path category called the [[fundamental category]] of $X$.

* When $X$ is a [[smooth space]], there is a notion of path category where less than homotopy of paths is divided out: just _thin_ homotopy. This yields a notion of [[path groupoid]]. 

* If _parameterized_ paths are used, there is a way to get a category of paths without dividing out any equivalence relation: this is the [[Moore path category]].


## Arrow category

Given a [[category]] $X$, the [[functor category]] $[I,X]$ for $I$ the [[interval category]] might be called a "directed path category of $X$" (similar to [[path space]]). However, this functor category is referred to instead as the [[arrow category]] of $X$ and sometimes even denoted $Arr(X)$.
