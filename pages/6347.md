## Idea

Perturbative [[string theory]] is defined in terms of certain classes of 2d [[CFT]]s. Depending on which class that is, one speaks of different _types_ of string theory.

* In _type II string theory_ the CFTs in question are $(1,1)$-supersymmetric and defined on [[orientation|oriented]] [[worldsheet]]s;

* In _[[heterotic string theory]]_ the CFTs in question are $(0,1)$-supersymmetric and defined on [[orientation|oriented]] [[worldsheet]]s;

* In ...
