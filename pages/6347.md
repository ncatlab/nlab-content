## Idea

Perturbative [[string theory]] is defined in terms of certain classes of 2d [[CFT]]s. Depending on which class that is, one speaks of different _types_ of string theory.

* In _type II string theory_ the CFTs in question are $(1,1)$-supersymmetric and defined on [[orientation|oriented]] [[worldsheet]]s;

* In _[[heterotic string theory]]_ the CFTs in question are $(0,1)$-supersymmetric and defined on [[orientation|oriented]] [[worldsheet]]s;

* In ...

## Properties

### Effective QFT

The [[effective quantum field theory]] of type II string theory containts --besides [[supergravity]] -- the [[self-dual higher gauge theory]] of [[RR-fields]] and [[Kalb-Ramond field]]s.


### Anomaly cancellation

Apart from the [[Weyl anomaly]], which cancels for 10-dimensional [[target space]]s, the [[action functional]] of the [[string]]-[[sigma-model]] also in general has an _[anomalous action functional](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/quantum+anomaly#AnomalousActionFunctional)_ , for two reasons:

1. The [[holonomy|higher holonomy]] of the higher [[background gauge field]]s is in general not a function, but a [[section]] of a [[line bundle]];

1. The fermionic [[path integral]] over the [[worldsheet]]-[[spinor]]s of the [[superstring]] produces as section of a [[Pfaffian line bundle]].

In order for the action functional to be well-defined, the [[tensor product]] of these different anomaly [[line bundle]]s over the bosonic [[configuration space]] must have trivial class (as [[connection on a bundle|bundles with connection]], even). This gives rise to various further anomaly cancellation conditions:

For the open [[type II string]] the condition is known as the [[Freed-Witten anomaly cancellation]] condition: it says that the restriction of the [[B-field]] to any [[D-brane]] must consistute the twist of a [[twisted spin^c structure]] on the brane.

A more detailed analysis of these type II anomalies is in ([DFMI](#DFMI)) and ([DFMII](#DFMII)).




### Holographic dual

By a [[holographic principle]] realized in this case as [[AdS/CFT correspondence]] (see the references there), type II string theory is supposed to be dual to 4-dimensional [[super Yang-Mills theory]].
