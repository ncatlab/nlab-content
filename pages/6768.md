An arrangement of hyperplanes is a finite set of hyperplanes in a (finite-dimensional) linear, affine or projective space. Usually one studies in fact the complement of the union of the hyperplanes, and its topological and other properties. This space is the basis of many interesting fiber bundles appearing in conformal field theory, study of [[hypergeometric function]]s (Aomoto, Gelfand, Varchenko), quantum groups etc.
