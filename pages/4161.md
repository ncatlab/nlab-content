## Idea ##
In [[quantum field theory]] on [[Minkowski space]] all fields must transform according to a definite (finite dimensional) [[representation]] of the universal cover of the [[Poincare group]], which determines the [[spin]] of each field. From the [[representation theory]] of the [[Poincare group]] it is known that the spin $s$ is a number $s = \frac{n}{2}$ with $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

On the other hand, if we take fields to be pointwise localized in the sense of the [[Wightman axioms]], then the locality axiom (also known as _Einstein microcausality_ ) says that spacelike separated field operators either commute or anticommute: Two [[Fermionic field]]s anticommute, two [[Bosonic field]]s commute, a Fermionic and a Bosonic field commute.

The **spin-statistics theorem** states that fields with integer spin $s$ (n  is even) are Bosonic fields, fields with half-integer spin (n is uneven) are [[Fermionic field]]s. A better name for the theorem would therefore be spin- _commutation_ theorem, the name spin- _statistics_ theorem stems from the fact that [[Boson]]s (the particles associated to [[Bosonic field]]s) are social, multiple particles can exist in the same quantum state, while [[Fermion]]s are not social: The [[Pauli exclusion principle]] says maximally one [[Fermion]] can exist in a given quantum state. This leads to different [[partition functions]] in [[statistical mechanics]] of systems consisting of [[Boson]]s only and of [[Fermion]]s only, hence the name.

The statement and proof of the theorem depend on the framework for [[quantum field theory]] that is used, therefore there are, strictly speaking, several versions of the spin-statistics theorem, but the _physical interpretation_ is always the same. 

## Theorem

### Theorem in the AQFT Framework
In the [[Haag-Kastler approach]] the [[Bisognano-Wichmann theorem]] states a relation of the representation of the Poincare group on certain local algebras of [[local nets]] and their [[modular group]]s. If this relation holds for a given net, then this net is said to fulfill the Bisognano-Wichmann property.

The Guido-Longo-paper cited in the references states the spin-statistics theorem for local nets with this property.
