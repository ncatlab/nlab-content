## Definition

(This refers to the term as it arises in algebra, particularly in algebraic number theory.) A **local field** is a [[locally compact space|locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] (non-discrete) [[topological space|topological]] [[field]]. 

Note that for a topological field, the [[closed subspace|topological closure]] of $\{0\}$ is an [[ideal]], which must therefore be either $\{0\}$ or the whole field. It follows that either a topological field is [[separation axioms|T]]$_1$ (and therefore Hausdorff or T$_2$; see [[uniform space]]), or has the [[discrete and codiscrete topology|codiscrete topology]]. 

## Properties

Any local field is one of the following types: 

* Characteristic zero. In this case local fields $F$ are [[complete space|completions]] of [[number field]]s with respect to metrics induced by [[valuation]]s. The valuations may be 

  * Archimedean. Here for every $x \in F$, there exists $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that ${\|n x\|} \gt 1$, where ${\| \cdot \|}$ is the valuation. The local fields in this case are isomorphic as topological fields to $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$. 

  * Nonarchimedean. Such valuations are discrete valuations, and are the completions of discrete valuations induced by prime ideals $v$ of the ring of algebraic integers $\mathcal{O}_k$ in a number field $k$. The valuation on the number field is defined by ${\|x\|_v} = q^{-n}$ where $q$ is the cardinality of the [[finite field]] $\mathcal{O}_k/v$, and $n$ is the least integer such that $x \in v^n$. The completion is called the **$v$-adic completion** and is denoted $k_v$. 

* Characteristic $p \gt 1$. In this case local fields are fields of [[Laurent series]] $\mathbb{F}_q((t))$ over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ of cardinality $q = p^n$; here ${\|f(t)\|} = q^{-n}$ where $f(t) = a_n t^n + a_{n+1}t^{n+1} + \ldots$. The valuation is nonarchimedean. 

Local fields are technically useful in modern [[number theory]]; for example in formulating local-to-global principles, and in formulations of [[class field theory]] following Tate's thesis. Part of the technical convenience resides in the fact that one can effectively do [[Fourier analysis]] on them; as additive [[topological abelian group|topological groups]], they are self-dual locally compact abelian groups (in the sense of [[Pontrjagin dual|Pontryagin duality]]). 
 

## Relation to local rings (warning)

It is possible to misconstrue "local field" in several different ways, to wit: 

* As meaning "[[field of fractions]] of an [[integral domain]] that is a [[local ring]]". 

* As meaning "field of fractions of an integral domain that arises as the completion of a local ring with respect to its canonical valuation". 

The first misinterpretation is relatively easy to rule out, since it would imply that $\mathbb{Q}$ is a "local field" (being the field of fractions of the localization of $\mathbb{Z}$ with respect to any prime). 

The second misinterpretation is a little more subtle; it is quite true that the _nonarchimedean_ local fields as defined above are prominent examples of such a construction (where the local ring in question is either the localization of a number field with respect to a prime ideal (characteristic zero case), or the localization of $\mathbb{F}_q[t]$ at a prime (characteristic $p \gt 1$ case)). Two points against that: 

* The archimedean local fields $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{C}$ do _not_ arise this way; 

* Under the $m$-[[adic topology]], the completion of a local ring $R$ with maximal ideal $m$, i.e., the [[inverse limit]] of the [[diagram]] 
$$\ldots R/m^{n+1} \stackrel{proj}{\to} R/m^n \to \ldots \to R/m$$
is typically not compact (and its field of fractions is not locally compact). It is of course compact if each $R/m^n$ is finite with the discrete topology, and we remark that finite local rings are precisely of the form $\mathcal{O}/p^n$ where $p$ is a prime in a number field $\mathcal{O}$, or of the form $\mathbb{F}_q[t]/t^n$. (Hm, is that right?)

Both points indicate that the provenance of "local" in "local field" (the terminology is due to Weil, I believe) is probably the local compactness of the topology; the fact that the nonarchimedean local fields do arise as completions with respect to discrete valuations tied to local ring structure (in the algebraic sense) can be seen as a happy coincidence between two senses of "local". (Or unhappy, depending on one's point of view!) 

There is a functor from the category of nonarchimedean local fields to the category of local rings, which assigns the maximal compact subring to a local field $k$. This is a local ring $\mathcal{O}$ whose field of fractions is $k$ again. We reiterate, however, that this construction does not apply to archimedean local fields (isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$).
