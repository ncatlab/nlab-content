## Idea

In [[type theory]], a _type of (small) types_ is a [[universe]] of (small) [[types]]. 

In [[homotopy type theory]] a type of (small) types is what [[semantics|semantically]] becomes a (small)[[object classifier]].

Therefore the type of types is a refinement of the [[type of propositions]] which only contains the [[(-1)-truncated]]/[[h-level]]-1 types.
