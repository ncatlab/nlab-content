## Idea

In [[type theory]], a _type of (small) types_ -- usually written $Type$ -- is a [[type]] whose [[terms]] are themselves [[types]].  Thus, it is a [[universe]] of (small) [[types]].

In [[homotopy type theory]] a type of (small) types is what [[semantics|semantically]] becomes a (small) [[object classifier]].  Thus, the type of types is a refinement of the [[type of propositions]] which only contains the [[(-1)-truncated]]/[[h-level]]-1 types (and is semantically a [[subobject classifier]]).

In the presence of a type of types a [[judgement]] of the form

$$
  \vdash A : Type
$$

says that $A$ is a [[term]] of [[type]] $Type$, hence is a (small) [[type]] itself. More generally, a [[hypothetical judgement]] of the form

$$
  x : X \vdash A(x) : Type
$$

says that $A$ is an $X$-[[dependent type]].

In [[homotopy type theory]] the type of types $Type$ is often assumed to satisfy the [[univalence]] axiom. This is a reflection of the fact that in its [[categorical semantics]] as an [[object classifier]] is part of an [[internal (infinity,1)-category]] in the ambient [[(infinity,1)-topos]]: the one that as an [[indexed category]] is the small [[codomain fibration]].

[[Per Martin-Lof]]'s original type theory contained a type of *all* types, which therefore in particular contained itself, i.e. one had $Type : Type$.  But it was pointed out by [[Jean-Yves Girard]] that this was inconsistent; see [[Girard's paradox]].  Thus, modern type theories generally contain a hierarchy of types of types, with $Type_0 : Type_1$ and $Type_1 : Type_2$, etc.

## Properties

### Universe enlargement
 {#UniverseEnlargement}

Both [[Coq]] and [[Agda]] have systems to manage universe sizes and [[universe enlargement]] automatically; Agda's is more advanced (universe polymorphism), whereas Coq's is good enough for many purposes but tends to produce "universe inconsistencies" when working with [[univalence]].
