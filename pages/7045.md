## Idea

In [[type theory]], a _type of (small) types_ -- usually written $Type$ -- is a [[universe]] of (small) [[types]]. 

In [[homotopy type theory]] a type of (small) types is what [[semantics|semantically]] becomes a (small) [[object classifier]].

Therefore the type of types is a refinement of the [[type of propositions]] which only contains the [[(-1)-truncated]]/[[h-level]]-1 types.

In the presence of a type of types a [[judgement]] of the form

$$
  \vdash A : Type
$$

says that $A$ is a [[term]] of [[type]] $Type$, hence is a (small) [[type]] itself. More generally, a [[hypothetical judgement]] of the form

$$
  x : X \vdash A(x) : Type
$$

says that $A$ is an $X$-[[dependent type]].

In [[homotopy type theory]] the type of types $Type$ satisfies the [[univalence]] axiom. This is a reflection of the fact that in its [[categorical semantics]] as an [[object classifier]] is part of an [[internal (infinity,1)-category]] in the ambient [[(infinity,1)-topos]]: the one that as an [[indexed category]] is the small [[codomain fibration]].
