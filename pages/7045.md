## Idea

In [[type theory]], a _type of (small) types_ -- usually written $Type$ -- is a [[type]] whose [[terms]] are themselves [[types]].  Thus, it is a [[universe]] of (small) [[types]], a _universe in type theory_.

In [[homotopy type theory]] a type of (small) types is what in [[(∞,1)-category theory|higher]] [[categorical semantics]] is interpreted as a (small) [[object classifier]].  Thus, the type of types is a refinement of the [[type of propositions]] which only contains the [[(-1)-truncated]]/[[h-level]]-1 types (and is semantically a [[subobject classifier]]).

In the presence of a type of types a [[judgement]] of the form

$$
  \vdash A : Type
$$

says that $A$ is a [[term]] of [[type]] $Type$, hence is a (small) [[type]] itself. More generally, a [[hypothetical judgement]] of the form

$$
  x : X \vdash A(x) : Type
$$

says that $A$ is an $X$-[[dependent type]].

In [[homotopy type theory]] the type of types $Type$ is often assumed to satisfy the [[univalence]] [[axiom]]. This is a reflection of the fact that in its [[categorical semantics]] as an [[object classifier]] is part of an [[internal (∞,1)-category]] in the ambient [[(∞,1)-topos]]: the one that as an [[indexed category]] is the small [[codomain fibration]].

[[Per Martin-Lof]]'s original type theory contained a type of *all* types, which therefore in particular contained itself, i.e. one had $Type : Type$.  But it was pointed out by [[Jean-Yves Girard]] that this was inconsistent; see [[Girard's paradox]].  Thus, modern type theories generally contain a hierarchy of types of types, with $Type_0 : Type_1$ and $Type_1 : Type_2$, etc.

## Formalizations 

### Type Universe à la Russel
  {#RusselStyle}

A **universe à la Russell** is a [[type]] whose terms *are* types. In the presence of a separate [[judgment]] "$A \;type$", this can be formulated as a [[natural deduction|deduction rule]] of the form

$$\frac{A:U}{A \;type}$$

Thus, the [type formers](natural+deduction#IntroductionAndElimination) have rules saying which universe they belong to, such as:

$$\frac{A:U\quad B:A\to U}{\Pi\, A\, B : U}$$

With universes à la Russell, we can also omit the judgment "$A\; type$" and replace it everywhere by a judgment that A is a term of some universe. This is the approach taken by the [[Homotopy Type Theory -- Univalent Foundations of Mathematics|HoTT textbook]] and by [[Coq]].


### Type Universe à la Tarski
 {#TarskiStyle}

A **universe à la Tarski** ([Hofmann, section 2.1.6](#Hofmann)) is a type together with an "interpretation" operation allowing us to regard its [[terms]] as types (or "codes for types"). Thus we have a rule such as

$$\frac{A:U}{El(A)\;type}$$

We usually also have operations on the universe corresponding to (but not identical to) type formers, such as

$$\frac{A:U\quad B:A\to U}{pi(A, B) : U}$$

with an [[equality]] $El(pi(A,B))=\Pi \, El(A)\, El(B)$. Usually this latter equality (and those for other type formers) is a [[judgmental equality]]. If it is only a [[propositional equality]],we may speak of a **weakly à la Tarski universe**.

Universes defined internally via [[induction-recursion]] are (strongly) à la Tarski. Weakly à la Tarski universes are easier to obtain in [[semantics]] (see [below](#CategoricalSemantics)): they are somewhat more annoying to use, but probably suffice for most purposes.


## Properties

### Universe enlargement
 {#UniverseEnlargement}

Both [[Coq]] and [[Agda]] have systems to manage universe sizes and [[universe enlargement]] automatically; Agda's is more advanced (universe polymorphism), whereas Coq's is good enough for many purposes but tends to produce "universe inconsistencies" when working with [[univalence]].  

### Categorical semantics
 {#CategoricalSemantics}

[[univalence|Univalent]] type universes [à la Russel](#RusselStyle) have been shown to be interpreted in [[type-theoretic model categories]] presenting the base [[(∞,1)-topos]] [[∞Grpd]]
([Kapulkin-Lumsdaine-Voevodsky 12](#KapulkinLumsdaineVoevodsky12))
and more generally presenting [[(∞,1)-toposes]] of [[(∞,1)-presheaves]] over [[elegant Reedy categories]] ([Shulman 13](#Shulman13)).

Discussion for general [[(∞,1)-toposes]] (of [[(∞,1)-sheaves]]) that should have implementation [weakly à la Tarski](#TarskiStyle) is in ([Gepner-Kock 12](#GepnerKock12)).

For more on this see the respective sections at _[[relation between type theory and category theory]]_.
