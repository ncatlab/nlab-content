## Idea

A _pretopological space_ is a slight generalisation of a [[topological space]] where the concept of _neighbourhood_ is taken as primary.


## Definitions

Given a [[set]] $S$, let a __point__ in $S$ be an element of $S$, and let a __set__ in $S$ be a [[subset]] of $S$.  Given a [[relation]] $\stackrel{\circ}\in$ between points in $S$ and sets in $S$, say that the set $U$ is a __neighbourhood__ (or __$\stackrel{\circ}\in$-neighbourhood__ to be precise) of $x$ if $x \stackrel{\circ}\in U$ (which may also be written $x \in \stackrel{\circ}U$).

A __pretopology__ (or __pretopological structure__) on $S$ is such a relation $\stackrel{\circ}\in$ that satisfies these properties:

*  Centred:  If $U$ is a neighbourhood of $x$, then $x$ belongs to $U$:
   $$ x \stackrel{\circ}\in U \;\Rightarrow\; x \in U .$$
*  Isotone:  If $U$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ and $U$ is contained in $V$, then $V$ is a neighbourhood of $x$:
   $$ x \stackrel{\circ}\in U \;\Rightarrow\; U \subseteq V \;\Rightarrow\; x \stackrel{\circ}\in V .$$
*  Filtered:  If $U$ and $V$ are neighbourhoods of $x$, then so is their [[intersection]]:
   $$ x \stackrel{\circ}\in U \;\Rightarrow\; x \stackrel{\circ}\in V \;\Rightarrow\; x \stackrel{\circ}\in U \cap V .$$
*  Nontrivial:  The entire space is a neighbourhood of $x$:
   $$ x \stackrel{\circ}\in S .$$

In other words, the collection of neighbourhoods of $x$ must be a [[filter]] that is refined by the free [[ultrafilter]] at $x$.  This is called the __neighbourhood filter__ of $x$.


A __pretopological space__ is a set equipped with a pretopological structure.


A __continuous map__ from a pretopological space $S$ to a pretopological space $T$ is a [[function]] $f$ from $S$ to $T$ such that:

*  For every point $x$ in $S$, if $U$ is a neighbourhood of $f(x)$ in $T$, then the [[preimage]] $f^*(U)$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ in $S$.


In this way, pretopological spaces and continuous maps form a [[category]] $Pre Top$.


## Convergence structure

If $F$ is a [[filter]] on a pretopological space $S$, then $F$ __converges__ to a point $x$ (written $F \to x$) if $F$ refines (contains) the neighbourhood filter of $x$.

This relation satisfies the following properties:

*  Centred:  The free ultrafilter at $x$ (the collection of all sets that $x$ belongs to) converges to $x$:
   $$ \{ A \;|\; x \in A \} \to x .$$
*  Isotone:  If $F$ converges to $x$ and $G$ refines $F$, then $G$ converges to $x$:
   $$ F \to x \;\Rightarrow\; F \subseteq G \;\Rightarrow\; G \to x .$$
*  Infinitely filtered:  The intersection of all filters that converge to $x$ itself converges to $x$:
   $$ \bigcap \{ F \;|\; F \to x \} \to x .$$

In this way, every pretopological space becomes a [[convergence space]].

In fact, we can recover the pretopological structure from the convergence structure as follows: $x \stackrel{\circ}\in U$ if and only if $U$ belongs to every filter that converges to $x$.  In other words, that intersection that appears in the infinite filtration condition is the neighbourhood filter of $x$.  Furthermore, this definition assigns a pretopological structure to any convergence space satsifying the conditions above, and a map between pretopological spaces is continuous if and only if it is continuous as a map between convergence spaces.

Thus, we can define a pretopological space as an infinitely filtered convergence space, making $Pre Top$ a [[full subcategory]] of the category $Conv$ of convergence spaces.

Every pretopological convergence satisfies the star property, so that $Pre Top$ is in fact a full subcategory of the category $Ps Top$ of [[pseudotopological spaces]].


## Examples

Every [[topological space]] is a pretopological space, using the usual definition of (not necessarily open) neighbourhood: $x \stackrel{\circ}\in U$ if there exists some open set $G$ such that $x \in G$ and $G \subseteq U$.  Also, a map between topological spaces is continuous if and only if it\'s continuous as a map between pretopological spaces.  In this way, the category [[Top]] of topological spaces becomes a full subcategory of $Pre Top$.

In fact, we can easily characterise the topological pretopologies, allowing us to define a topological space as a pretopological space satisfying this axiom:

*  If $U$ is a set, then let $\stackrel{\circ}U$ be the set of all points that $U$ is a neighbourhood of.  Then $\stackrel{\circ}U$ is a neighbourhood of each of its members.  That is,
   $$ x \stackrel{\circ}\in U \;\Rightarrow\; x \stackrel{\circ}\in \{ y \;|\; y \stackrel{\circ}\in U \} .$$

In the terms defined below, a topological space is a pretopological space in which every preinterior is open.


Here is an example of a nontopological pretopological space, although admittedly it is a bit artificial.  (This is based on Section 15.6 of [[HAF]].)  Consider a [[metric space]] $S$; according to the usual pretopology on $S$, $U$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ if there is a positive number $\epsilon$ such that $U$ contains the ball $ \{ y \;|\; d(x,y) \lt \epsilon \} $.  Now given a [[natural number]] $n$, we will give $S^n$ the _plus pretopology_: $U$ is a neighbourhood of $\vec{x} = (x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ if there is a positive number $\epsilon$ such that $U$ contains the $l^0$-ball $ \{ \vec{y} \;|\; \inf_i d(x_i,y_i) \lt \epsilon \} $.  (If $S$ is a line and $n = 2$, then this is a plus sign '+' with $(x_1,x_2)$ at the centre and cross bars of length $2 \epsilon$.)  Then $S^n$ is a pretopological space, but it is topological only if $n \leq 1$ or $S$ is a [[subsingleton]].

This example can probably be generalised to a [[uniform space]] $S$.  Possibly there is some interesting universal property of this 'plus product', although it seems to go from $Unif \times Unif$ to $Pre Top$, so maybe we need to work in a different category.  (There is a notion of [[uniform convergence space]] that generalises uniform spaces much like convergence spaces generalise topological spaces; perhaps the plus product takes place there.)


## Topological structure

Fix a pretopological space $S$.

The __preinterior__ of a set $A$ is the set $\stackrel{\circ}A$ of all points that $A$ is a neighbourhood of:
$$ \stackrel{\circ}A = \{ x \;|\; x \stackrel{\circ}\in A \} .$$
A set $A$ is __open__ if it equals its preinterior.  The __interior__ $Int(A)$ of $A$ is the union of all of the open sets contained in $A$.

The __preclosure__ of $A$ is the set $\bar{A}$ of all points that $A$ meets every neighbourhood of:
$$ \{ x \;|\; \forall{U},\; x \stackrel{\circ}\in U \;\Rightarrow\; A \cap U \neq \empty \} .$$
A set $A$ is __closed__ if it equals its preclosure.  The __closure__ $Cl(A)$ of $A$ is the intersection of all of the closed sets containing $A$.

The duality between (pre)interiors and open sets on the one hand and (pre)closures and closed sets on the other hand is (at least if you assume [[excluded middle]]) just what you would expect: the (pre)interior of a [[complement]] is the complement of the (pre)closure, and a set is open if and only if its complement is closed.  However, a preinterior is generally not open but larger than an interior; similarly, a preclosure is generally not closed but smaller than a closure.  The situation looks like this:
$$ A \supseteq \stackrel{\circ}A \supseteq \stackrel{\circ}{\stackrel{\circ}A} \supseteq \cdots \supseteq Int(A) ,$$
and
$$ A \subseteq \bar{A} \subseteq \overline{\bar{A}} \subseteq \cdots \subseteq Cl(A) .$$

In general, there can be transfinitely many terms in these sequences.  For example, let $\Omega$ be any [[ordinal number]] with the following pretopology:
* $0 \stackrel{\circ}\in U$ iff $U=\Omega$.
* $\alpha \stackrel{\circ}\in U$, where $\alpha\lt\Omega$ is a nonzero ordinal, iff $[\beta,\Omega)\subseteq U$ for some $\beta \lt\alpha$.

Let $A=[1,\Omega)$.  Then $\stackrel{\circ}A = [2,\Omega)$, $\stackrel{\circ}{\stackrel{\circ}A} = [3,\Omega)$, and so on, the process taking $\Omega$ steps to stabilize at $Int(A)=\emptyset$.

However, in many cases this iteration stabilizes after finitely many terms.  The plus product seems to stabilise after $n$ iterations.  And of course, in a topological space it only takes one step.

Although it\'s not immediately obvious from the definitions, an interior is open, and a closure is closed.  Thus, the open sets in $S$ form a topological structure on $S$.  This topological structure does *not* (in general) give the original pretopology on $S$; instead, this makes $Top$ a [[reflective subcategory]] of $Pre Top$.
