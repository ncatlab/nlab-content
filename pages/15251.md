## Idea

Over [[compact topological space|compact]] [[complex manifolds]] $X$, _Hodge symmetry_ is the property that the [[Dolbeault cohomology]] groups $H^{p,q}(X)$ are taken into each other under [[complex conjugation]] followed by switching the bidegree:

$$
  H^{p,q}(X) \simeq \overline{H^{q,p}(X)}
  \,.
$$

In particular this means that the [[dimension]] of the cohomology groups in degree $(p,q)$ -- the [[Hodge number]] $h^{p,q}$ -- coincides with that in bidegree $(q,p)$.

By the [[Dolbeault theorem]] this is formulated more generally in terms of [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] as saying that

$$
  dim_{\mathbb{C}} H^q(X,\Omega^p)
  =
  dim_{\mathbb{C}} H^p(X,\Omega^q)  
  \,,
$$

where $\Omega^p$ denotes the [[abelian sheaf]] of [[holomorphic p-forms]].

In this form the statement of Hodge symmetry makes sense more generally for [[complex analytic spaces]] and [[schemes]] over the [[complex numbers]] -- but it is no longer generally true in these more general cases

Sufficient conditions for Hodge symmetry to hold more generally are discussed for instance in ([Joshi 14](#Joshi14)).
