## Idea

_Instanton Floer homology_ is a variant of [[Floer homology]] which applies to 3-dimensional [[manifold]]s. It is effectively the [[Morse homology]] of the [[Chern-Simons theory]] [[action functional]].

For $\Sigma$ a 3-[[dimension]]al [[compact space|compact]] [[smooth manifold]] and $G$ a [[simply connected]] [[compact space|compact]] [[Lie group]] let $[\Sigma,\mathbf{B}G_{conn}]$ be the [[space]] of $G$-[[connection on a bundle|connections]] on $\Sigma$, which is equivalently the [[groupoid of Lie algebra valued forms]] on $\Sigma$ in this case.

The _instanton Floer homology_ groups of $\Sigma$ are something like the "mid-dimensional" [[singular homology]] groups of the [[configuration space]] $[\Sigma,\mathbf{B}G_{conn}]$.

More precisely, there is canonically the [[Chern-Simons action functional]]

$$
  S_{CS} : [\Sigma,\mathbf{B}G_{conn}] \to U(1)
$$

on this space of connections, and one can form the corresponding [[Morse homology]].

The [[critical locus]] of $S_{CS}$ is the space of flat $G$-connections (those with vanishing [[curvature]]), whereas the [[flow line]]s of $S_{CS}$ correspond to the [[Yang-Mills instanton]]s on $\Sigma \times [0,1]$.
