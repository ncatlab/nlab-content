Topology is nowdays intertwined with many other mathematical fields, like differential geometry and homological algebra, therefore yielding specialized subfields like [[algebraic topology]], [[differential topology]] and so on. The basic study of general [[topological spaces]] (and closely related general structures like [[nearness space]]s, [[uniform space|uniformities]], [[bitopological space]]s and so on) remains the subject of __general topology__ or __point-set topology__. It overlaps largely with __set-theoretic topology__, though when talking of set-theretic topology, rather than general topology, that there is a slight connotation of relevance of additional [[foundations|foundational axioms]] or other logical (say [[constructive mathematics|intuitionistic proofs]]) or set-theoretical considerations ([[large cardinal]]s for example). 

Some of the notions in general topology covered in the nLab include [[topological space]], [[Top]], [[Hausdorff space]], [[specialization topology]], [[separation axioms]], [[sequential space]], [[Frechet-Uryson space]], [[compact space]], [[Sierpinski space]], ...

For purposes in modern mathematics sometimes roles of topological spaces are however replaced by a [[convenient category of topological spaces]], [[nice topological space]]s, [[simplicial set]]s, [[locales]], [[sites]], [[topoi]], [[orbispace]]s, [[topological stack]]s and so on.
