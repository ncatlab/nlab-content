Topology is nowdays intertwined with many other mathematical fields, like differential geometry and homological algebra, therefore yielding specialized subfields like [[algebraic topology]], [[differential topology]] and so on. The basic study of general [[topological spaces]] (and closely related general structures like nearness spaces, uniformities, bitopological spaces and so on) stays the subject of __general topology__. It overlaps largely with __set-theoretic topology__, though when talking on set-theretic topology, father than general topology, that there is slight conotation on relevance of additional foundational axioms or other logical (say intuitionistic proofs) or set-theoretical considerations (large cardinals for example). 

Some of the notions in general topology covered in nlab include [[topological space]], [[Top]], [[Hausdorff space]], [[convenient category of topological spaces]], [[specialization topology]], [[separation axioms]], [[sequential space]], [[Frechet-Uryson space]], [[compact space]], [[Sierpinski space]], [[nice topological space]]...

For purposes in modern mathematics sometimes roles of topological spaces are however replaced by [[sites]], [[topoi]], [[orbispace]]s, [[topological stack]]s and so on.
