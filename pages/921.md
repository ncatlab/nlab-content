## Idea 

A real number is what is approximated by a sequence of [[rational number]]s.  

(This is if one uses the usual [[order|ordering]] of rational numbers; others will give the idea of $p$-[[adic number|adic numbers]].)

### Formalizations and their history

The original idea of a real number came from [[geometry]]; one thinks of a real number as specifying a point on a line.  (More precisely, given two distinct points on the line, called $0$ and $1$, you get a [[bijection]] between the points and the real numbers.)  [[Euclid]] (citing [[Eudoxus]]) dealt with ratios of geometric magnitudes, which give positive real numbers; an arbitrary real number is then a difference of ratios of magnitudes.  (But the Greeks did not think of such ratios as numbers.)

A big project of the 19th century (at least in hindsight) was the 'arithmetisation of analysis': showing how real numbers could be defined completely in terms of rational numbers (and the desired classes of functions on them could be defined in terms of the general point-set notion of [[function]]).  Two successful approaches were developed in 1972, [[Richard Dedekind]]\'s definition of real numbers as certain sets of rational numbers (called _Dedekind cuts_) and [[Georg Cantor]]\'s definition as certain sequences of rational numbers (called _Cauchy sequences_).

A more modern approach is instead to characterise the properties that the set of real numbers must have and to prove that this is [[generalized the|categorical]] (unique up to a unique bijection preserving those properties).  Then the important result of the 19th century programme is simply that this is consistent (that there exists at least one such set).  One can even use Hilbert\'s or Tarski\'s axioms for geometry to do this characterisation, coming full circle back to geometry.

Exactly how to define or characterise real numbers is still important in [[constructive mathematics]] and [[topos]] theory.  We should consider possible definitions (including those that don\'t make the numbers primary) and their consequences below, but I\'m done writing for now.  See also [[locale of real numbers]].

## Definitions and characterizations

### The locale of real numbers

A [[constructive mathematics|constructive]] construction of the real line is discussed at 

* [[locale of real numbers]]

### Characterization in terms of terminal coalgebras

The real line $\mathbb{R}$, or at least the positive real line $\mathbb{R}^+$, may be characterized as the [[terminal object|terminal]] [[coalgebra for an endofunctor]]

Let [[Pos]] be the [[category]] of [[poset]]s. Consider the endofunctor

$$
  F_1 : Pos \to Pos
$$

that acts by [[ordinal product]] with $\omega$

$$
  F_1 : X \mapsto X \cdot \omega
  \,.
$$

###### Proposition

The terminal coalgebra of $F_1$ is order isomorphic to the non-negative real line $\mathbb{R}^+$, with its standard order.
