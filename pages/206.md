Word **algebra** has many distinct but related meanings in mathematics:

* the field of mathematics concerning algebraic structures and algebraic (symbolic) manipulations 

* a standard school or university curriculum on that subject

* any algebraic structure ([[universal algebra]])

* [[associative algebra]]

* [[associative unital algebra]]

* monoid in any monoidal category

* algebraic structure in some of the standard frameworks (algebras over [[operad]]s, [[monad]]s, Lawvere [[algebraic theory|algebraic theories]], representations of [[PROP]]-s etc.)

* higher categorical analogues of algebras, for example [[pseudoalgebra]]s over [[pseudomonad]]s

Various fields of mathematics or mathematical concepts can be manipulated in an algebraic or symbolic way, and such approaches or formalized subfields have names like [[categorical algebra]], [[homological algebra]], [[homotopical algebra]] and so on. Methods of combinatorics which involve much algebra, and manipulations with [[formal power series]] in particular, is called [[algebraic combinatorics]].
