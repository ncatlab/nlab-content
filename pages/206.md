An **algebra** is generally used concretely to refer to (equivalently) 

* a [[monoid]] [[internalization|internal to]] [[Vect]];

* a one-object category [[enriched category|enriched over]] ([[Vect]],$\otimes$);

* an [[algebroid]] with one object;

* a vector space $V$ equipped with linear maps $p : V \otimes V \to V$ and $i : k \to V$ satisfying the associativity and unitalness conditions;

* a [[ring]] [[bundle|under]] the ground field $k$.

More abstractly, one speaks of **algebras** over any [[monad]], [[operad]], or other general way to express an algebraic theory.
