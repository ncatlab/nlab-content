**Algebra** is the manipulation of symbols without (necessarily) regard for their meaning, especially in a way that can be formalized in [[cartesian logic]].  It is often seen as [[duality|dual]] to [[geometry]].

The word 'algebra' is often also used for an algebraic structure:
* as in [[universal algebra]];
* often by default an [[associative unital algebra]];
* more generally a [[monoid]] [[internalization|in]] any [[monoidal category]];
* also often used for [[nonassociative algebra]];
* an [[algebra over an operad]], of a [[monad]], a [[PROP]], etc;
* a model of an [[algebraic theory]];
* for a category $C$ and endofunctor $F$, an algebra is an object $X$ in $C$ and a map $\alpha: F(X) \to X$.
* higher categorical analogues of algebras, for example [[algebroid]]s, and [[pseudoalgebra]]s over [[pseudomonad]]s.

Various fields of mathematics or mathematical concepts can be manipulated in an algebraic or symbolic way, and such approaches or formalized subfields have names like [[categorical algebra]], [[homological algebra]], [[homotopical algebra]] and so on. Methods of combinatorics which involve much algebra, and manipulations with [[formal power series]] in particular, are called [[algebraic combinatorics]].
