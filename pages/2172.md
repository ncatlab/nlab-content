Here's a few links to prime the pump:
* [Logical Graph : Introduction](http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/LogicalGraph.html)
* [Logical Graph : Formal Development](http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/LogicalGraphFormalDevelopment.html)
* [Futures Of Logical Graphs](http://mywikibiz.com/Directory:Jon_Awbrey/Papers/Futures_Of_Logical_Graphs)

I'm hoping I'll be able to develop the content in several different directions here.
