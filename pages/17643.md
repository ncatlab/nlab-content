In [[propositional logic]], the __contrapositive rule__ states that it is valid to derive $\neg{Q} \to \neg{P}$ from $P \to Q$ (where $\neg$ is [[negation]] and $\to$ is [[implication]]).  In symbols:
$$ \frac {P \to Q} {\neg{Q} \to \neg{P}} \;CP $$
The combination of this rule, followed by modus ponens (the [[elimination rule]] for implication) was traditionally called _modus tollens_:
$$ \frac {\displaystyle\frac{P \to Q} {\neg{Q} \to \neg{P}} \;CP \;\;\; \neg{Q}} {\neg{P}} \; \to\mathcal{E} $$

The contrapositive rule is valid in [[intuitionistic logic]], not just in [[classical logic]]; however, the reverse rule is valid only in classical logic. 

Another intuitionistically valid rule, this one reversible, is
$$ \frac {P \to \neg{Q}} {Q \to \neg{P}} $$
as both statements are equivalent to the negation of $P \wedge Q$ (where $\wedge$ is [[conjunction]]).  However, the superficially similar
$$ \frac {\neg{P} \to Q} {\neg{Q} \to P} $$
is again valid only classically.
