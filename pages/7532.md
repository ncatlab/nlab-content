## Idea


In a category of [[simplicial presheaves]] it makes sense to ask if a morphism is _locally_ a [[Kan fibration]], in that the required lifting property holds after refinement along some [[cover]]. 

These _local fibrations_ are typically not the fibrations in any of the [[model structures on simplicial presheaves]]. (They may instead form the fibrations in the corresponding [[category of fibrant objects]]-structure on simplicial sheaves.) Nevertheless, it is useful to consider them, and they satisfy various properties otherwise known from genuine fibrations. 

For instance a pullback diagram of simplicial presheaves is a [[homotopy pullback]]  already if one of the two morphisms in the cospan is a local fibration (e.g. [Jardine, lemma 5.16](#Jardine))
