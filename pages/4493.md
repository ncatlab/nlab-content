Ehresmann's theorem states that a [[proper morphism|proper]] [[submersion]] $f : X \to Y$ is a locally trivial [[fibration]].

This is important in [[algebraic geometry]] because it implies that the [[higher direct image]]s $R^i f_\ast \underline{\mathbb{C}}$ of the [[constant sheaf]] $\underline{\mathbb{C}}$ on $X$ are ($\mathbb{C}$-)[[local system]]s on $Y$. (If we work in the algebraic category, then instead of the constant sheaf $\underline{\mathbb{C}}$ we take the [[de Rham cohomology|de Rham complex]] $\Omega_X^\bullet$ and instead of the higher direct images we take the [[hypercohomology|hyper]]-higher direct images.) The [[Riemann-Hilbert correspondence|corresponding]] [[vector bundle]] then has a canonical [[flat connection|flat]] [[connection]], known as the [[Gauss-Manin connection]]. This is the typical setup one considers when studying variations of [[Hodge theory|Hodge]] structure.
