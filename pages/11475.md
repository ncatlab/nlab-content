This notion is a variant of a notion of a compact space (every cover has a finite subcover).

Let $L$ be a [[complete lattice]]. An element $c\in L$ is __compact__ iff any of the following equivalent conditions hold:

(i) for every $S\subset L$, such that $c\leq sup(S)$, there is a finite subset $F\subset S$ such that $c\leq sup(F)$

(ii) for every [[directed set|directed subset]] $S\subset L$ such that $c\leq S$
there is $s\in S$ with $c\leq s$

A [[frame]] $L$ is __algebraic__ if every element of $L$ is the sup of some set
of compact elements. In that case, one can take the set of all elements below or
equal the given element. The latter definition is accepted also for [[quantale]]s.

$L$ is __coherent__ if it is algebraic and the finite inf of a set of compact elements
is compact. 

__Theorem.__ A frame $L$ is coherent iff $L$ is isomorphic to the frame of ideals in some [[distributive lattice]].

A [[quantale]] is __precoherent__ if it is algebraic and binary products of compact elements are compact. Precoherent quantale is __coherent__ if the truth is a compact element.
