# Definition #

A **regular monomorphism** is a [[morphism]] which occurs as the [[equalizer]] of some parallel pair of morphisms.  Every such morphism is automatically a [[monomorphism]].

# Examples #

* In [[Set]], or more generally in any [[pretopos]], every monomorphism is regular.

* In [[Top]], the monics are the injective functions, while the regular monos are the embeddings (that is, the injective functions whose sources have the [[weak topology|topologies induced]] from their targets); these are in fact all of the [[extremal monomorphism]]s.

  _Tom_: [Wikipedia claims that it's the extremal monics that are the embeddings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_of_topological_spaces#Other_properties), and I have a simple proof which seems valid.  Can we clarify this?

  _[[Toby Bartels|Toby]]_:  Wikipedia also claims (in the very next line) that every extremal mono is regular (and the converse is automatic), so they are actually in agreement with us.

  _Tom_: You're right; in the very next sentence no less!  But I get the impression it's the "extremality" that causes it to be an embedding, and the "regularness" equivalence is just accidental.  In anycase, for people with (very) limited understanding like me I think it would be helpful to have a clarification here.

  _[[Toby Bartels|Toby]]_:  Well, this is the article about regular monomorphisms, so that\'s what we stress here.  You could certainly add the fact to [[extremal monomorphism]] as well, however.  (Heck, it looks like you could even start that page!  Compare [[extremal epimorphism]], where more has already been written.)

* In [[Grp]], the monics are (up to isomorphism) the inclusions of [[subgroup]]s, while the regular monics are the inclusions of _[[normal subgroup|normal]]_ subgroups.

* In [[Ab]], or more generally any [[abelian category]], every monomorphism is regular.
