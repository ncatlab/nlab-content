# Definition #

A **regular monomorphism** is a [[morphism]] which occurs as the [[equalizer]] of some parallel pair of morphisms.  Every such morphism is automatically a [[monomorphism]].

# Examples #

* In [[Set]], or more generally in any [[pretopos]], every monic is regular.

* In [[Top]], the monics are the injective functions, while the regular monics are the embeddings (that is, injective functions whose source has the topology induced from their target).

  _Tom_: [Wikipedia claims that it's the extremal monics that are the embeddings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_of_topological_spaces#Other_properties), and I have a simple proof which seems valid.  Can we clarify this?

  _Toby_:  Wikipedia also claims (in the very next line) that every extremal mono is regular (and the converse is automatic), so they are actually in agreement with us.

  _Tom_: You're right; in the very next sentence no less!  But I get the impression it's the "extremality" that causes it to be an embedding, and the "regularness" equivalence is just accidental.  In anycase, for people with (very) limited understanding like me I think it would be helpful to have a clarification here.

* In [[Grp]], the monics are (up to isomorphism) the inclusions of subgroups, while the regular monics are the inclusions of _normal_ subgroups.

  Should we be able to see this in terms of the expressivity of [[regular logic]]?

  I don't think so... regular logic is, so far as I know, about regular _epimorphisms_ and _ordinary_ monomorphisms.

* In [[Ab]], or more generally any [[abelian category]], every monomorphism is regular.
