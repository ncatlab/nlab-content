## Idea

A [[monomorphism]] is _regular_ if it behaves like an [[embedding]].

* [[effective epimorphism]] $\Rightarrow$ [[regular epimorphism]] $\Leftrightarrow$ [[covering]]

* [[effective monomorphism]] $\Rightarrow$ [[regular monomorphism]] $\Leftrightarrow$ [[embedding]] .

The universal factorization through an embedding is the [[image]].


## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

A **regular monomorphism** is a [[morphism]] $f : c \to d$ in some [[category]] which occurs as the [[equalizer]] of _some_ [[pair of parallel morphisms]] $d \stackrel{\to}{\to} e$, i.e. for which a [[limit]] [[diagram]] of the form

$$
  c \stackrel{f}{\to} d \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow} e
$$

exists.

=--

From the defining [[universal property]] of the [[limit]] it follows directly that a regular monomorphism is in particular a [[monomorphism]].

The dual concept is that of a [[regular epimorphism]].

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Beware that ([CassidyHebertKelly](#CassidyHebertKelly)) use `regular monomorphism' in a more general way: for them, a regular monomorphism is by definition the joint equalizer or an arbitrary family of parallel pairs of morphisms with common domain.
This concept is sometimes called [[strict monomorphism]], dual to the more commonly used [[strict epimorphism]].

## Properties

### Relation to effective monomorphisms 

+-- {: .num_defn #EffectiveMonomorphism}
###### Definition

A monomorphism $i: A \to B$ is an [[effective monomorphism]] if it is the [[equalizer]] of its [[cokernel pair]]: if the [[pushout]]

$$\array{
A & \stackrel{i}{\to} & B \\
i \downarrow & & \downarrow i_1 \\
B & \underset{i_2}{\to} & B +_A B
}$$ 

exists and $i$ is the equalizer of the pair of coprojections $i_1, i_2: B \stackrel{\to}{\to} B +_A B$. Obviously effective monomorphisms are regular. 

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #RegEquEff} 
###### Proposition

In a [[category]] with [[equalizers]] and [[cokernel pairs]], the class of  regular monomorphism coincides with that of [[effective monomorphism]] (def. \ref{EffectiveMonomorphism}).

=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 

It is clear that every effective monomorphism is regular, we need to show the converse.

Suppose $i \colon A \to B$ is the equalizer of a pair of morphisms $f, g: B \to C$, and with notation as in def. \ref{EffectiveMonomorphism}, let $j: E \to B$ be the equalizer of the pair of coprojections $i_1, i_2$. Since $f \circ i = g \circ i$, there exists a unique map $\phi: B +_A B \to C$ such that $\phi \circ i_1 = f$ and $\phi \circ i_2 = g$. Then, since 
$$f j = \phi i_1 j = \phi i_2 j = g j$$ 
and since $i: A \to B$ is the equalizer of the pair $(f, g)$, there is a unique map $k: E \to A$ such that $j = i k$. Since $i_1 i = i_2 i$, there is a unique map $l: A \to E$ such that $i = j l$. The maps $k$, $l$ are mutually inverse.

## Examples {#Examples}

* In [[Set]], or more generally in any [[pretopos]], every [[monomorphism]] is regular.

* Similarly, in [[Ab]], and more generally any [[abelian category]], every monomorphism is regular.

###### Proposition
**(regular monomorphisms of [[topological spaces]])**

In the [[category]] [[Top]] of [[topological space]], 

1. the [[monomorphisms]] are the those [[continuous functions]] which are [[injective functions]];

1. the regular monomorphisms are the [[topological embeddings]] (that is, the injective continuous functions whose sources have the [[induced topology|topologies induced]] from their targets); these are in fact all of the [[extremal monomorphisms]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof 

Regarding the first statement: an injective continuous function $f \colon X \to Y$ clearly has the cancellation property that defines monomorphisms: for parallel continuous functions $g_1,g_2 \colon Z \to X$: if $f \circ g_1 = f \circ g_1$, then $g_1 = g_2$ because continuous functions are equal precisely if their underlying functions of sets are equal. Conversely, if $f$ has the cacellation property, then testing on points $g_1, g_2 \colon \ast \to X$ gives that $f$ is injective.

Regarding the second statement: from the construction of [[equalizers]] in [[Top]] ([this example](Top#EqualizerInTop)) we have that these are topological subspace inclusions.

Conversely, let  $i \colon X \to Y$ be a [[topological subspace embedding]]. We need to show that this is the equalizer of some pair of parallel morphisms.

To that end, form the [[cokernel pair]] $(i_1, i_2)$ by taking the [[pushout]] of $i$ against itself (in the category of sets, and using the [[quotient topology]] on a [[disjoint union space]]). By prop. \ref{RegEquEff}, the equalizer of that pair is the set-theoretic equalizer of that pair of functions endowed with the [[subspace topology]]. Since monomorphisms in [[Set]] are regular, we get the function $i$ back and (again by [this example](Top#EqualizerInTop)) it is equipped with the subspace topology.

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition 
In [[Grp]], the monics are (up to [[isomorphism]]) the inclusions of [[subgroup]]s, and every monomorphism is regular.
=--

In contrast, the [[normal monomorphisms]] (where one of the morphisms $d \to e$ is required to be the [[zero morphism]]) are the inclusions of [[normal subgroups]].

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof 
We follow [exercise 7H](http://katmat.math.uni-bremen.de/acc/acc.pdf#page=129) of ([AdamekHerrlichStrecker](#AdamekHerrlichStrecker)).

Let $K \hookrightarrow H$ be a subgroup. We 
need to define another group $G$ and group homomorphisms 
$f_1, f_2 : H \to G$ such that

$$
  K = \{h \in H  | f_1(h) = f_2(h)\}
  \,.
$$

To that end, let 

$$
  X  := H/K  \coprod  \{\hat K\}  := \{ h K | h \in H \}  \coprod  \{\hat K\} 
$$

be the set of [[coset]]s together with one more element $\hat K$.

Let then

$$ 
  G = Aut_{Set}(X)
$$

be the [[permutation group]] on $X$. 

Define $\rho \in G$ to be the permutation that exchanges the coset $e K$ with the extra element $\hat K$ and is the identity on all other elements.

Finally define group homomorphism $f_1,f_2 : H \to G$ by

$$
  f_1(h) : x \mapsto 
  \left\{
     \array{
        h h' K & if x = h' K
        \\
        \hat K & if x = \hat K
     }
  \right.
$$

and

$$
  f_2(h) = \rho \circ f_1(h) \circ \rho^{-1}
  \,.
$$

It is clear that these maps are indeed group homomorphisms.

So for $h \in H$ we have that 

$$
  f_1(h) : \hat K \mapsto \hat K
  \,,
$$

and

$$
  f_1(h) : e K \mapsto h K
$$

and

$$
  f_2(h) 
  : 
  \hat K 
   \mapsto 
  e K 
    \mapsto 
   h K 
   \mapsto 
  \left\{
    \array{
     \hat K & if h \in K
     \\
     h K & otherwise
   }
   \right.
  \,.
$$

$$
  f_2(h) : e K \mapsto \hat K \mapsto \hat K \mapsto e K
  \,.
$$

So we have $f_1(h) = f_2(h)$ precisely if $h \in K$.

=--


## In an $(\infty,1)$-category {#Infty1Version}

In the context of [[higher category theory]]
the ordinary [[limit]] diagram $c \stackrel{f}{\to} d \stackrel{\to}{\to} e $ may be thought of as the beginning of a [[homotopy limit]] diagram over a [[cosimplicial object|cosimplicial]] diagram

$$
  c \stackrel{f}{\to} d_0 \stackrel{\to}{\to} d_1
  \stackrel{\to}{\stackrel{\to}{\to}}
  d_2
  \cdots
  \,.
$$

Accordingly, it is not unreasonable to define a 
[[regular monomorphism in an (∞,1)-category]], to be a morphism which is the [[limit in a quasi-category]] of a cosimplicial diagram.

In practice this is of particular relevance for the $\infty$-version of [[regular epimorphism]]s: with the analogous definition as described there, a morphism $f : c \to d$ is a [[regular epimorphism]] in an [[(∞,1)-category]] $C$ if for all objects $e \in C$ the induced morphism $f^* : C(d,e) \to C(c,e)$ is a [[regular monomorphism]] in [[∞Grpd]] (for instance [[model structure on simplicial sets|modeled]] by a [[homotopy limit]] over a cosimplicial diagram in [[SSet]]).

**Warning.** The same warning as at [[regular epimorphism]] applies: with this definition of regular monomorphism in an [[(∞,1)-category]] these may fail to satisfy various definitions of plain monomorphisms that one might think of.
