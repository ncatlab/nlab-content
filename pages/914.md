## Idea 
 {#Idea}

A _net_ in a [[set]] $X$ is a [[function]] from a [[directed set]] $D$ to $X$. Special cases of nets are [[sequences]], for which $D = \mathbb{N}_{\leq}$ is the [[natural numbers]]. Regarded as a generalization of sequences, nets are used in [[topology]] for formalization of the concept of [[convergence]].

Nets are also called _Moore--Smith sequences_ and are equivalent (in a certain sense) to [[proper filters]] (def. \ref{Filter} below), their _[[eventuality filters]]_ (def. \ref{EventualityFilter} below).

The concept of nets is motivated from the fact that where plain [[sequences]] detect [[topology|topological]] properties in [[metric spaces]], in generally they fail to do so in more general [[topological spaces]]. 
For example [[sequentially compact metric spaces are equivalently compact metric spaces]], but for general [[topological spaces]] being [[sequentially compact space|sequentially compact]] neither implies nor is implied by being [[compact space|compact]] (see at _[[sequentially compact space]]_ [Examples and counter-examples](sequentially+compact+topological+space#Examples)). 

Inspection of these counter-examples reveals that the problem is that sequences indexed by the [[natural numbers]] may be "too short" in that they cannot go deep enough into uncountable territory, and they are "too slim" in that they proceed to their potential limiting point only from one direction, instead of from many at once. The use of general [[directed sets]] for nets in place of just the [[natural numbers]] for sequences fixes these two issues. 

While the concept of nets is similar to that of sequences, one gets a cleaner theory still by considering not the nets themselves but their "[[filters]] of subsets which they eventually meet" (def. \ref{EventuallyAndFrequently} below), called their _[[eventuality filters]]_ (def. \ref{EventualityFilter} below). For example equivalent filters are equal (in contrast to nets) and (unless in [[predicative mathematics]]) the set of filters on a set $X$ is [[small set|small]] (not a proper class).


## Definitions

### Directed sets


+-- {: .num_defn #DirectedSet}
###### Definition
**([[directed set]])**

A _[[directed set]]_ is

* a [[preordered set]] $(D, \leq)$, hence a set $D$ equipped with a [[reflexive relation|reflexive]] and [[transitive]] [[relation]] $\leq$

such that

* every [[finite set|finite]] [[subset]] has an [[upper bound]], hence for any $a,b \in D$ there exists $c \in D$ with $a \leq c$ and $b \leq c$.

=--


+-- {: .num_example #DirectedSetOfNaturalNumbers}
###### Example
**([[directed set]] of [[natural numbers]])**

The [[natural numbers]] $\mathbb{N}$ with their canonical
lower-or-equal relation $\leq$ form a [[directed set]] (def. \ref{DirectedSet}).

=--

+-- {: .num_example #DirectedSetOfNeighbourhods}
###### Example
**([[directed set]] of [[neighbourhoods]])**

Let $(X, \tau)$ be a [[topological space]] and let $x \in X$ be an element of the underlying set. Then then set of $(Nbhd_X(x)_{\superset})$ [[neighbourhoods]] of $x$, ordered by _reverse_ inclusion, is a [[directed set]] (def. \ref{DirectedSet}).

=--


### Nets
 {#Nets}


+-- {: .num_defn #Net}
###### Definition

For $X$ a [[set]], then a _net_ in $X$ is 

1. a [[directed set]] $A$ (def. \ref{DirectedSet}), called the _index set_,

1. a [[function]] $\nu \colon A \to X$ from (the underlying set of) $A$ to $X$.

We say that $A$ _indexes_ the net.  

=--

+-- {: .num_example #SequencesAreNets}
###### Example
**([[sequences]] are [[nets]])**

A [[sequence]] is a net (def. \ref{Net}) whose directed set of indices is the [[natural numbers]] $(\mathbb{N}, \leq)$ (example \ref{DirectedSetOfNaturalNumbers}).

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Although the index set $A$ in def. \ref{Net}, being a [[directed set]], is equipped with a [[preorder]], the function $\nu \colon A \to X$ is not required to preserve this in any way.  This forms an exception to the rule of thumb that a preordered set may be replaced by its quotient [[partial order|poset]].  

You can get around this if you instead define a net in $X$ as a [[multi-valued function]] from a partially ordered directed set $A$ to $X$.  Although there is not much point to doing this in general, it can make a difference if you put restrictions on the possibilities for $A$, in particular if you consider the definition of [[sequence]].  In some [[type theory|type-theoretic]] [[foundations]] of mathematics, you can get the same effect by defining a net to be an 'operation' (a [[prefunction]], like a function but not required to preserve [[equality]]).

=--

+-- {.num_defn #EventuallyAndFrequently}
###### Definition
**([[eventually]] and frquently)**

Consider [[net]] $\nu \colon A \to X$ (def. \ref{Net}), and given a [[subset]] $S \subset X$. We say that 

1. $\nu$ is _[[eventually]] in $S$_ if there exists $i \in A$ such that $\nu_j \in S$ for every $j \ge i$.  

1. $\nu$ is _frequently in $S$_ if for every index $i \in A$, then $\nu_j \in S$ for some $j \ge i$.  

=--

+-- {.num_remark}
###### Remark

Sometimes one says 'infinitely often' in place of 'frequently' in def. \ref{EventuallyAndFrequently} and even 'cofinitely often' in place of 'eventually'; these derive from the special case of sequences, where they may be taken literally.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #Convergence}
###### Definition
**([[convergence]] of [[nets]])**

Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[topological space]], and let $\nu \colon A \to X$ be a [[net]] in the underlying set (def. \ref{Net}).

We say that the net $\nu$ 

1. _[[convergence|converges]]_ to an element $x \in X$ if given any [[neighbourhood]] $U$ of $x$, $\nu$ is eventually in $U$ (def. \ref{EventuallyAndFrequently}); 

1. _clusters_ at $x$ if, for every [[neighbourhood]] $U$ of $x$, $\nu$ is frequently in $U$ (also def. \ref{EventuallyAndFrequently}).  

=--




### Subnets

The definition of the concept of _sub-nets_ of a net requires some care. The point of the definition is to ensure that prop \ref{...} below becomes true, which characterizes [[compact topological spaces]] as those in which every net has a sub-net that [[convergence|converges]] (def. \ref{Convergence}).

There are several different definitions of 'subnet' in the literature, all of which intend to generalise the concept of subsequences.  We state them now in order of increasing generality.  Note that it is Definition \ref{AA} which is correct in that it corresponds precisely to refinement of filters.  However, the other two definitions (def. \ref{Willard}, def. \ref{Kelley}) are sufficient (in a sense made precise by theorem \ref{EquivalenceOfDefinitionsOfSubnets} below) and may be easier to work with.


+-- {.num_defn #Willard}
###### Definition
(Willard, 1970).

Given a net $(x_{\alpha})$ with index set $A$, and a net $(y_{\beta})$ with an index set $B$, we say that $y$ is a __subnet__ of $x$ if:

We have a [[function]] $f\colon B \to A$ such that

*  $f$ maps $x$ to $y$ (that is, for every $\beta \in B$, $y_{\beta} = x_{f(\beta)}$);
*  $f$ is monotone (that is, for every $\beta_1 \geq \beta_2 \in B$, $f(\beta_1) \geq f(\beta_2)$);
*  $f$ is cofinal (that is, for every $\alpha \in A$ there is a $\beta \in B$ such that $f(\beta) \geq \alpha$).
=--

+-- {.num_defn #Kelley}
###### Definition
(Kelley, 1955).

Given a net $(x_{\alpha})$ with index set $A$, and a net $(y_{\beta})$ with an index set $B$, we say that $y$ is a __subnet__ of $x$ if:

We have a [[function]] $f\colon B \to A$ such that

*  $f$ maps $x$ to $y$ (that is, for every $\beta \in B$, $y_{\beta} = x_{f(\beta)}$);
*  $f$ is strongly cofinal (that is, for every $\alpha \in A$ there is a $\beta \in B$ such that, for every $\beta_1 \geq \beta \in B$, $f(\beta_1) \geq \alpha$).

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Notice that the function $f$ in definitions \ref{Willard} and \ref{Kelley} is _not_ required to be an [[injection]], and it need not be. As a result, a [[sequence]] regarded as a [[net]] in general has more sub-nets than it has sub-sequences.

=--


+-- {.num_defn #AA}
###### Definition
(Smiley, 1957; Årnes & Andenæs, 1972).

Given a net $(x_{\alpha})$ with index set $A$, and a net $(y_{\beta})$ with an index set $B$, we say that $y$ is a __subnet__ of $x$ if:

The [[eventuality filter]] of $y$ (def. \ref{EventualityFilter}) refines the eventuality filter of $x$.  (Explicitly, for every $\alpha \in A$ there is a $\beta \in B$ such that, for every $\beta_1 \geq \beta \in B$ there is an $\alpha_1 \geq \alpha \in A$ such that $y_{\beta_1} = x_{\alpha_1}$.)
=--


The equivalence between these definitions is as follows:

+-- {.num_theorem #EquivalenceOfDefinitionsOfSubnets}
###### Theorem
([Schechter, 1996](#Schechter96)).

1.  If $y$ is a (\ref{Willard})-subnet of $x$, then $y$ is also a (\ref{Kelley})-subnet of $x$, using the same function $f$.
2.  If $y$ is a (\ref{Kelley})-subnet of $x$, then $y$ is also a (\ref{AA})-subnet of $x$.
3.  If $y$ is a (\ref{AA})-subnet of $x$, then there is some net $z$ such that
    *  $z$ is equivalent to $y$ in the sense that $y$ and $z$ are (\ref{AA})-subnets of each other, and
    *  $z$ is a (\ref{Willard})-subnet of $x$, using some function.
=--

So from the perspective of definition (\ref{AA}), there are enough (\ref{Willard})-subnets and (\ref{Kelley})-subnets, up to equivalence.



### Eventuality filters
 {#NetsAndFilters} 

Recall that: 

+-- {: .num_defn #Filter}
###### Definition
**([[filter]])**

Given a [[set]] $X$ then a [[set]] of [[subsets]] of $X$, hence a subset of the [[power set]]

$$
  \mathcal{F} \subset P(X)
$$

is called a _[[filter]]_ of subsets if it is closed under [[intersections]] and under taking supersets.

The filter $\mathcal{F}$ is called _proper_ if each set in it is [[inhabited subset|inhabited]].

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #EventualityFilter}
###### Definition
**([[eventuality filter]])**

Let $X$ be a [[set]] and let $\nu \colon D \to X$ be a net in $X$ (def. \ref{Net}).

The _[[eventuality filter]]_ $\mathcal{F}_\nu$ of the net $\nu$ is the [[filter]] (def. \ref{Filter}) onsisting of the subsets that $\nu$ is _eventually in_, according to def. \ref{EventuallyAndFrequently}.

$$
  \left(
    (U \subset X) \in \mathcal{F}_\nu
  \right)
   \,\Leftrightarrow\,
  \left(
    \nu \, \text{is eventually in}\, U
  \right)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark
**(equivalence of nets)**

Two nets are to be considered __equivalent__ if they have the same [[eventuality filter]] according to def. \ref{EventualityFilter}. 
By def. \ref{AA} and theorem \ref{EquivalenceOfDefinitionsOfSubnets}, this means equivalently that they are both subnets of each other.  

In particular, equivalent nets define the same logical quantifiers (see [below](#LogicOfNets)) and are therefore indeed equivalent for the application to [[topology]] (see [below](#RelationToTopology)).  

(Of course, it is possible to distinguish them by using the standard logical quantifiers instead.)

=--


Conversely,  every [[filter]] is the [[eventuality filter]] of some net:

+-- {: .num_defn #FilterNet}
###### Definition

Let $X$ be a [[set]] and let  $\mathcal{F} \subset P(X)$ be a [[filter]] of subsets of $X$ (def. \ref{Filter}).

Consider the [[disjoint union]] $\underset{U \in \mathcal{F}}{\sqcup}$ of subsets in  $\mathcal{F}$, hence the set whose elements are [[pairs]] of the form $(U,x)$, where $x \in U \in \mathcal{F}$. Equipped with the ordering 

$$ 
  \left(
    (U,x) \geq (V,y)  
  \right) 
  \,\Leftrightarrow\,
  \left(
    U \subset V$ 
  \right)
  \phantom{AAA}
  \text{(regardless of}\, x\, \text{and} \, y\text{)}  
}
$$

the fact that $\mathcal{F}$ is a proper filter implies that this is a [[directed set]] according to def. \ref{DirectedSet}. (It is actually enough to use only a base of the filters).

Then the _filter net_ $\nu_F$ of $\mathcal{F}$ is the [[net]] on $X$ (def. \ref{Net}) given by

$$
  \array{
    \left(
      \underset{U \in \mathcal{F}}{\sqcup} U
    \right)_{\supset}
      &\overset{\nu_{\mathcal{F}}}{\longrightarrow}&
    X
    \\
    (U,x) &\overset{\phantom{AAA}}{\mapsto}& x
  }
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Given a [[set]] $X$ and a [[filter]] of subsets $\mathcal{F} \subset P(X)$ (def. \ref{Filter}), then $\mathcal{F}$ is the [[eventuality filter]] (def. \ref{EventualityFilter}) of its filter net (def. \ref{FilterNet}).

## Properties

### Relation to topology
 {#RelationToTopology}

One may in fact recover the topology $\tau$ on the set $X$ simply by knowing which nets converge to which points.  It is possible to define elementary conditions on this [[convergence]] relation that characterise whether it is topological (that is whether it comes from a topology on $X$), although these are a bit complicated.

By keeping only the simple conditions, one gets the definition of a [[convergence space]]; this is a more general concept than a topological space and includes many non-topological situations where we want to say that a sequence converges to some value (such as convergence in measure).  It is also very nice to describe [[compact space|compact]] and [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] spaces in terms of the convergence relation.




### Logic of nets 
 {#LogicOfNets}

A [[property]] of [[elements]] of a [[set]] $X$ (given by the [[subset]] $S \subset X$ of those elements of $X$ satisfying this property) may be applied to nets in $X$.  


Being eventually in $S$, def. \ref{EventuallyAndFrequently}, is a weakening of being always in $S$ (given by the [[universal quantifier]] $\forall_\nu$), while being frequently in $S$ is a strengthening of being sometime in $S$ (given by the [[particular quantifier]] $\exists_\nu$).  Indeed we can build a [[formal logic]] out of these.  Use $\ess\forall i, p[\nu_i]$ or $\ess\forall_\nu p$ to mean that a predicate $p$ in $X$ is eventually true, and use $\ess\exists i, p[\nu_i]$ or $\ess\exists_\nu p$ to mean that $p$ is frequently true.  Then we have:
$$\forall_\nu p \;\Rightarrow\; \ess\forall_\nu p \;\Rightarrow\; \ess\exists_\nu p \;\Rightarrow\; \exists_\nu p$$
$$\ess\forall_\nu (p \wedge q) \;\Leftrightarrow\; \ess\forall_\nu p \wedge \ess\forall_\nu q$$
$$\ess\exists_\nu (p \wedge q) \;\Rightarrow\; \ess\exists_\nu p \wedge \ess\exists_\nu q$$
$$\ess\forall_\nu (p \vee q) \;\Leftarrow\; \ess\forall_\nu p \wedge \ess\forall_\nu q$$
$$\ess\exists_\nu (p \vee q) \;\Leftrightarrow\; \ess\exists_\nu p \vee \ess\exists_\nu q$$
$$\ess\forall_\nu \neg{p} \;\Leftrightarrow\; \neg\ess\exists_\nu p$$
and other analogues of theorems from [[predicate logic]].  Note that the last item listed requires [[excluded middle]] even though its analogue from ordinary predicate logic does not.

A similar logic is satisfied by '[[almost everywhere]]' and its dual ('not almost nowhere' or 'somewhere significant') in [[measure spaces]].
