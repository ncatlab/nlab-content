## Idea

A **linear subspace** of an $R$-[[module]] $A$ is a [[concrete subobject]] of $A$ in the category ${}_R Mod$.

The *[[stuff]]* of a linear subspace of $A$ is a [[subset]] of $|A|$; it has the *property* of being closed under the module operations $0$, $ + $ and $ r \cdot $ inherent in $A$.
