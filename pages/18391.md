## Idea
**Arithmetic differential geometry** is an approach to [[arithmetic]] which looks to find analogs of constructions in [[differential geometry]], for example, [[arithmetic jet spaces]]. It has been developed primarily by [[Alexandru Buium]].

According to this approach, the classical derivatives of differential geometry are replaced by $p$-derivations for prime $p$, 

$$
\delta_p: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}, a \mapsto \delta_p a = \frac{a - a^p}{p}.
$$
