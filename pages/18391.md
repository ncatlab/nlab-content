## Idea
**Arithmetic differential geometry** is an approach to [[arithmetic]] which looks to find analogs of constructions in [[differential geometry]], for example, [[arithmetic jet spaces]]. It has been developed primarily by [[Alexandru Buium]].

According to this approach, the classical derivatives of differential geometry are replaced by [[p-derivations]] for prime $p$, such as the [[Fermat quotient]]

$$
\delta_p: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}, a \mapsto \delta_p a = \frac{a - a^p}{p}.
$$

##Comparison with Borger's absolute geometry

 
Buium explains that when working with a single prime his approach is consistent with [[Borger's absolute geometry]], which is described as "an algebraization of our analytic theory" ([Buium 17, p. 24](#Buium17)). However, in the case of multiple primes Borger requires [[Frobenius lifts]] to commute, and this diverges from the non-vanishing 'curvature' Buium derives from non-commuting lifts. For him, the ("manifold" corresponding to) the integers, $\mathbb{Z}$, is "intrinsically curved".
