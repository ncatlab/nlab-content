## Idea

In fundamental physics, notably in [[quantum field theory]] and [[string theory]] one often says that a non-trivial [[equivalence]] between two [[models (in theoretical physics)]] is a [[duality]]. 

## Examples

* [[Seiberg duality]]

* [[Montonen-Olive duality]]

* [[S-duality]]

* [[T-duality]]

* [[U-duality]]

* [[AdS/CFT|AdS/CFT duality]]
* [[AGT conjecture]]

## Relation to mathematical duality

In some cases such as _[[Montonen-Olive duality]]/[[S-duality]]_ the equivalence involves some actual [[duality]] in the mathematical sense, as in replacing the [[gauge group]] by its [[Langlands dual group]]. In [[T-duality]] only simple cases exhibit such obviously "dual" behaviour and in general cases such as [[U-duality]] really only the notion of _[[equivalence]]_ remains.

## Related concepts

There is also a duality in the _description_ of physics:
