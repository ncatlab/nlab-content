## Idea

In fundamental physics, notably in [[quantum field theory]] and [[string theory]] one often says that a non-trivial [[equivalence]] between two [[models (in theoretical physics)]] is a [[duality]]. 

## Examples

* [[Seiberg duality]], [[AGT conjecture]]

* [[S-duality]]

  * [[electro-magnetic duality]], [[Montonen-Olive duality]], [[geometric Langlands duality]]

* [[T-duality]]
  
  * [[mirror symmetry]]

* [[U-duality]]

* [[open/closed string duality]]

  * [[AdS/CFT|AdS/CFT duality]]

  * [[KLT relations]]

While most of these dualities refer to equivalences between [[quantum field theories]], they find their conceptual explanation in [[string theory]]. See at 

* [[duality in string theory]] 

for more.

## Relation to mathematical duality

In some cases such as _[[Montonen-Olive duality]]/[[S-duality]]_ the equivalence involves some actual [[duality]] in the mathematical sense, as in replacing the [[gauge group]] by its [[Langlands dual group]]. In [[T-duality]] only simple cases exhibit such obviously "dual" behaviour and in general cases such as [[U-duality]] really only the notion of _[[equivalence]]_ remains.
