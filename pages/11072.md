## Idea

In full [[linear logic]]/[[linear type theory]] there is assumed a (comonadic) [[modality]] denoted "!" and called the _exponential modality_, whose role is, roughly, to give linear types also a non-linear interpretation. This is also called  the "of course"-modality or the _storage modality_, and sometimes the "bang"-operation.

In classical linear logic (meaning with involutive de Morgan duality), the de Morgan dual of "!" is denoted "?" and called the "why not"-modality.

In [[categorical semantics]] of linear type theory the !-modality typically appears as a kind of [[Fock space]] construction. If one views [[linear logic]] as [[quantum logic]] (as discussed there), then this means that the !-modality produces [[free field theory|free]] [[second quantization]].


## Categorical semantics

Everyone agrees that ! should be a comonad (and ? should be a monad), but there are different ways to proceed from there.  The goal is to capture the syntactic rules allowing assumptions of the form $!A$ to be duplicated and discarded.

### Intuitionistic case

The original definition from [Seely](#Seely89), adapted to the intuitionistic case and modernized, is:

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition
Let $C$ be an [[symmetric monoidal category]] with [[cartesian products]].  A **Seely comonad** on $C$ is a comonad that is a [[strong monoidal functor]] from the [[cartesian monoidal category|cartesian monoidal structure]] to the symmetric monoidal structure, i.e. we have $!(A\times B)\cong !A \otimes !B$ and $!1\cong I$ coherently.  (There is also an additional [[coherence]] [[axiom]] that should be imposed; see [Mellies, section 7.3](#Mellies09).)
=--

(Note that in linear logic, the cartesian monoidal structure $\times$ is sometimes denoted by $\&$.)  This implies that the [[Kleisli category of a comonad|Kleisli category]] of ! (i.e.\ the category of cofree !-coalgebras) is cartesian monoidal.  If $C$ is *closed* symmetric monoidal then the Kleisli category of a [[cartesian closed category]], which is a categorical version of the translation of intuitionistic logic into linear logic.

Of course, the above definition depends on the existence of the cartesian product.  A different definition that doesn't require the existence of $\times$ was given by [Benton, Bierman, de Paiva, and Hyland](#BBPH92):

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition
Let $C$ be a [[symmetric monoidal category]]; a **linear exponential comonad** on $C$ is a [[lax monoidal functor|lax monoidal]] comonad such that every cofree !-coalgebra naturally carries the structure of a [[comonoid object]] in the category of coalgebras (i.e. the cofree-coalgebra functor lifts to the category of comonoids in the category of coalgebras).
=--

It follows automatically that all !-coalgebras are comonoids, and therefore that the category of all !-coalgebras (not just the cofree ones) is cartesian monoidal.  Note that for a comonad on a [[poset]], every coalgebra is free; thus the world of pure propositional "logic" doesn't tell us whether to consider the Kleisli category or the Eilenberg-Moore category for the translation.

A more even-handed approach is the following (see [Benton](#Benton95) and [Mellies](#Mellies09)), based on the observation that both Kleisli and Eilenberg-Moore categories are instances of adjunctions.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition
A **linear-nonlinear adjunction** is a [[monoidal adjunction]] $F : M \rightleftarrows L : G$ in which $L$ is symmetric monoidal and $M$ is cartesian monoidal.  The induced !-modality is the comonad $F G$ on $L$.
=--

This includes both of the previous definitions where $M$ is taken respectively to be the Kleisli category or the Eilenberg-Moore category of !.  Conversely, in any linear-nonlinear adjunction the induced comonad $F G$ can be shown to be a linear exponential comonad.  Moreover, if $!$ is a linear exponential comonad on a symmetric monoidal category $C$ with finite products, then the cofree !-coalgebra functor is a right adjoint and hence preserves cartesian products; but the cartesian products of coalgebras are the tensor product in $C$, so we have $!(A\times B) \cong !A \otimes !B$, the Seely condition.


### Classical case

For "classical" linear logic, we want $C$ to be not just (closed) symmetric monoidal but $\ast$-[[star-autonomous category|autonomous]].  If an $\ast$-autonomous category has a linear exponential comonad $!$ one can derive a ? from the ! by de Morgan duality, $?A = (!(A^*))^*$.  The resulting relationship between ! and ? was axiomatized in a way not requiring the de Morgan duality by [Blute, Cockett, and Seely](#BCS96):

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition
Let $C$ be a [[linearly distributive category]] with tensor product $\otimes$ and cotensor product $\parr$.  A (!,?)-modality on $C$ consists of:

1. a $\otimes$-monoidal comonad ! and a $\parr$-comonoidal monad ?
1. ? is a !-strong monad, and ! is a ?-strong comonad
1. all free !-coalgebras are naturally commutative $\otimes$-comonoids, and all free ?-algebras are naturally commutative $\parr$-monoids.
=--

Here a functor $F$ is [[strong functor|strong]] with respect to a lax monoidal functor $G$ if there is a natural transformation $F A \otimes G B \to F(A\otimes G B)$ satisfying some natural axioms, and we similarly require compatibility of the monad and comonad structure transformations.  BCS showed that if $C$ is in fact $\ast$-autonomous, it follows from the above definition that $?A = (!(A^*))^*$ as expected.

## Examples

\begin{theorem}
Suppose $F : M \rightleftarrows C : G$ is a linear-nonlinear adjunction, where $C$ is closed symmetric monoidal with finite limits and colimits, and $\bot\in C$ is an object.  Then there is an induced linear-nonlinear adjunction $M \rightleftarrows Chu(C,\bot)$ where $Chu(C,\bot)$ is the [[Chu construction]] $Chu(C,\bot)$, which is $\ast$-autonomous with finite limits and colimits.  Hence $Chu(C,\bot)$ admits a !-modality.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
The embedding of $C$ in $Chu(C,\bot)$ as $A \mapsto (A, [A,\bot], ev)$ is coreflective: the coreflection of $(B^+, B^-, e_B)$ is $(B^+, [B^+,\bot], ev)$.  Moreover, this subcategory is closed under the tensor product of $Chu(C,\bot)$, i.e. the embedding $C\hookrightarrow Chu(C,\bot)$ is strong monoidal, hence the adjunction is a monoidal adjunction.  Therefore, the composite adjunction $M \rightleftarrows C \rightleftarrows Chu(C,\bot)$ is again a linear-nonlinear-adjunction.
\end{proof}

Since a Chu construction is $\ast$-autonomous, this !-modality implies a dual ?-modality.

\begin{corollary}
If $C$ is a cartesian closed category with finite limits and colimits and $\bot\in C$ is an object, then there is a linear-nonlinear adjunction $C \rightleftarrows Chu(C,\bot)$, and hence $Chu(C,\bot)$ admits a !-modality.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
Apply the previous theorem to the identity adjunction $C\rightleftarrows C$.
\end{proof}

Note that the !-modality obtained from the corollary is [[idempotent comonad|idempotent]], while that obtained from the theorem is idempotent if and only if the original one was.  Other ways of constructing !-modalities, such as by cofree coalgebras, may produce examples that are not idempotent.


## Modal term calculi

Girard's original presentation of linear logic involved rules that explicitly assumed the presence of $!$ on hypotheses or on entire contexts, such as [[weakening rule|weakening]] and [[contraction rule|contraction]]:

$$ \frac{\Gamma \vdash B}{\Gamma, !A\vdash B} \qquad \frac{\Gamma,!A,!A \vdash B}{\Gamma, !A\vdash B} $$

and "promotion":

$$ \frac{!\Gamma \vdash A}{!\Gamma\vdash !A} $$

If this is translated into a [[natural deduction]] style term calculus, the resulting rules are more complicated than those of most type formers.  This can be avoided using [[adjoint type theory]] with two context zones, one "nonlinear" one where contraction and weakening are permitted (and [[admissible rule|admissible]]) and one "linear" one where they are not, with $!$ as a modality relating the two zones.

Such a "modal" presentation of linear logic was first introduced by Girard in his work on [[LU]] and then developed by a number of other people such as Plotkin, Wadler, Benton, and Barber.  See the references for details.

This presentation also generalizes naturally to [[dependent linear type theory]], with the nonlinear type theory being dependent, and the linear types depending on the nonlinear ones but nothing depending on linear types.  In this context, the $!$-modality decomposes into "context extension" and a "dependent sum".
