## Idea

In full [[linear logic]]/[[linear type theory]] there is assumed a (comonadic) [[modality]] denoted "!" and called the _exponential modality_, whose role is, roughly, to give linear types also a non-linear interpretation. This is also called  the "of course"-modality or the _storage modality_, and sometimes the "bang"-operation.

In classical linear logic (meaning with involutive de Morgan duality), the de Morgan dual of "!" is denoted "?" and called the "why not"-modality.

In [[categorical semantics]] of linear type theory the !-modality typically appears as a kind of [[Fock space]] construction. If one views [[linear logic]] as [[quantum logic]] (as discussed there), then this means that the !-modality produces [[free field theory|free]] [[second quantization]].


## Categorical semantics

Everyone agrees that ! should be a comonad (and ? should be a monad), but there are different ways to proceed from there.  The goal is to capture the syntactic rules allowing assumptions of the form $!A$ to be duplicated and discarded.  The original definition from [Seely](#Seely89) was:

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition
Let $C$ be an $\ast$-[[star-autonomous category|autonomous]] category with cartesian products.  A Seely !-modality on $C$ is a comonad that is a strong monoidal functor from the cartesian monoidal structure to the $\ast$-autonomous monoidal structure, i.e. we have $!(A\times B)\cong !A \otimes !B$ coherently.  (There is also a coherence axiom that should be imposed; see [Mellies, section 7.3](#Mellies09).)
=--

(Note that in linear logic, the cartesian monoidal structure $\times$ is sometimes denoted by $\&$.)  This implies that the [[Kleisli category]] of ! is a [[cartesian closed category]], which is a categorical version of the translation of intuitionistic logic into linear logic.

Of course, the above definition depends on the existence of the cartesian product, and relies on the self-duality of an $\ast$-autonomous category to derive the rules for ? from the rules for !.  A different definition that doesn't require the existence of $\times$ was given by [Benton, Bierman, de Paiva, and Hyland](#BBPH92):

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition
Let $C$ be a [[closed symmetric monoidal category]]; a !-modality on $C$ is a [[lax monoidal functor|lax monoidal]] comonad such that every !-coalgebra naturally carries the structure of a [[comonoid object]] in the category of coalgebras, such that coalgebra maps are comonoid maps.
=--

This definition implies that the category of all !-coalgebras (not just the free ones, i.e. its Kleisli category) is cartesian closed.  Note that for a comonad on a [[poset]], every coalgebra is free; thus the world of pure propositional "logic" doesn't tell us whether to consider the Kleisli category or the Eilenberg-Moore category for the translation.  A more even-handed approach is the following (see [Mellies](#Mellies09)):

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition
A *linear-nonlinear adjunction* is a [[monoidal adjunction]] $F : M \rightleftarrows L : G$ in which $L$ is symmetric monoidal and $M$ is cartesian monoidal.  The induced !-modality is the comonad $F G$ on $L$.
=--

This includes both of the previous definitions where $M$ is taken respectively to be the Kleisli category or the Eilenberg-Moore category of !.

On the other hand, the last two definitions are given only for "intuitionistic" linear logic, though in the $\ast$-autonomous case one could derive a ? from the ! by de Morgan duality.  A definition not requiring the de Morgan duality and describing ! and ? together was given by [Blute, Cockett, and Seely](#BCS96):

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition
Let $C$ be a [[linearly distributive category]] with tensor product $\otimes$ and cotensor product $\parr$.  A (!,?)-modality on $C$ consists of:

1. a $\otimes$-monoidal comonad ! and a $\parr$-comonoidal monad ?
1. ? is a !-strong monad, and ! is a ?-strong comonad
1. all free !-coalgebras are naturally commutative $\otimes$-comonoids, and all free ?-algebras are naturally commutative $\parr$-monoids.
=--

Here a functor $F$ is [[strong functor|strong]] with respect to a lax monoidal functor $G$ if there is a natural transformation $F A \otimes G B \to F(A\otimes G B)$ satisfying some natural axioms, and we similarly require compatibility of the monad and comonad structure transformations.
