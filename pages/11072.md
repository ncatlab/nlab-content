## Idea

In full [[linear logic]]/[[linear type theory]] there is assumed a (co-)[[modality]] denoted "!", whose role is, roughly, to give linear types also a non-linear interpretation. This is also called the _exponential conjunction_ and is also known as the "of course"-modality and sometimes also as the "bang"-operation (for better or worse).


For the moment see at _[dependent linear type theory -- The canonical co-modality](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/dependent+linear+type+theory#TheCanonicalComodality)_ for more.
