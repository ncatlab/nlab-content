## Idea

In full [[linear logic]]/[[linear type theory]] there is assumed a (comonadic) [[modality]] denoted "!" and called the _exponential modality_, whose role is, roughly, to give linear types also a non-linear interpretation. This is also called  the "of course"-modality and sometimes also as the "bang"-operation.

## Categorical semantics

We discuss some aspects of the [[categorical semantics]] of the !-modality.

### Fock space and Second quantization

In [[categorical semantics]] of linear type theory the !-modality typically appears as a kind of [[Fock space]] construction. If one views [[linear logic]] as [[quantum logic]] (as discussed there), then this means that the !-modality produces free [[second quantization]].

### Underlying adjunction

As any [[comonad]], the !-modality may be realized as induced from an [[adjunction]]. For more on this see for the moment at _[dependent linear type theory -- The canonical co-modality](dependent+linear+type+theory#TheCanonicalComodality)_ for more.
