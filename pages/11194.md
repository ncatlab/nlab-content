## Idea

A _dualizing object_ $D$ in a [[closed category]] $\mathcal{D}$ is an [[object]] such that the [[internal hom]] $[-,D] \colon \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}^{op}$ into it serves as an [[involution|involutive]] [[duality]] operation on $\mathcal{C}$ in that applying it twice yields an [[equivalence of categories]] $[[-,D],D] \colon \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}$.

Typically one assumes $\mathcal{C}$ to be a [[symmetric monoidal closed category]] and requires that the [[adjunct]] of the [[evaluation map]] (the [[unit of a monad|unit]] of the [[continuation monad]] of $D$) provides a [[natural equivalence]] 

$$
  id_{\mathcal{C}} \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} [[-,D],D]
  \,.
$$

Note that a [[star-autonomous category]] is by definition a symmetric monoidal closed category equipped with such a dualizing object $D$.

More specifically in [[homological algebra]] and [[stable homotopy theory]] there are typically also certain [[finite object|finiteness conditions]] imposed on a dualizing object $D$ and one speaks of specifically of _[[dualizing modules]]_ (See for instance ([Heard Stojanoska 14, def. 3.1](#HeardStojanoska14) and [[Representability Theorems|Lurie, section 4.2]]). 

Notably in a [[Grothendieck-Verdier context]] $(f^\ast \dashv f_\ast)$, $(f_! \dashv f^!)$ of [[six operations]] the functor $f^!$ typically preserves dualizing objects in this sense, which is a crucial ingredient of [[Verdier duality]]. 

## Examples

### In a cartesian closed category
 {#InACartesianClosedCategory}

A [[cartesian closed category]] that has a dualizing object is necessarily just a [[preorder]].

(This statement is often known as _[[Joyal]]'s lemma_, recalled for instance in [Abramsky 09](#Abramsky09)). It can be slightly strengthened as follows: 

+-- {: .num_prop} 
###### Proposition 
A cartesian closed category $C$ that is self-dual (carries an equivalence $N: C^{op} \to C$) is necessarily a preorder (whose posetal reflection is then a [[Heyting algebra]]). If the self-duality comes from a dualizing object, then the Heyting algebra is a Boolean algebra. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
For the first statement, let $1$ be terminal; then $N(1)$ is an initial object $0$, and similarly $N$ takes finite products to finite coproducts (coproducts are necessary for a Heyting algebra). So it remains to show $C$ is a preorder. Let $x, y$ be any two objects. The number of morphisms $x \to y$ is the number of morphisms $1 \to [x, y]$, which is the number of morphisms $N([x, y]) \to N(1) = 0$. But this is at most one since the initial object is strict (if there is any $z \to 0$, then $z$ is a retract of $0 \times z \cong 0$, hence $z \cong 0$; thus there is at most one morphism $z \to 0$). 

The second statement is immediate: if $d$ is the dualizing object, then 

$$d \cong [1, d] = N(1) \cong 0$$ 

so that $N(x) = [x, 0]$ is the negation and the hypothesis becomes the condition that double negation on the Heyting algebra is the identity, i.e., the Heyting algebra is a Boolean algebra.

### In the category of spectra -- Anderson duality

In the [[stable (infinity,1)-category of spectra]], the [[sphere spectrum]] (which induces [[Spanier-Whitehead duality]] on spectra which are [[dualizable objects]] with respect to the [[smash product of spectra]]) is not a dualizing object, but the [[Anderson spectrum]] $I_{\mathbb{Z}}$ is ([[Representability Theorems|Lurie, Example 4.3.9]]). The [[duality]] operation 
$[-,I_{\mathbb{Z}}]$ that it induces in [[Anderson duality]].

For instance the Anderson dual of [[KU]] is (complex conjugation-equivariantly) the 4-fold [[suspension spectrum]] $\Sigma^4 KU$ ([Heard-Stojanoska 14, theorem 8.2](#HeardStojanoska14)); and [[tmf]]$[1/2]$ is Anderson dual to its 21-fold suspension ([Stojanoska 12](#Stojanoska12))
