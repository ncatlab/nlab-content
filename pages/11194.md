## Idea

A _dualizing object_ $D$ in a [[closed category]] $\mathcal{D}$ is an [[object]] such that the [[internal hom]] $[-,D] \colon \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}^{op}$ into it serves as an [[involution|involutive]] [[duality]] operation on $\mathcal{C}$ in that applying it twice yields an [[equivalence of categories]] $[[-,D],D] \colon \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}$.

Typically one assumes $\mathcal{C}$ to be a [[closed monoidal category]] and requires that the [[adjunct]] of the [[evaluation map]] provides a [[natural equivalence]] 

$$
  id_{\mathcal{C}} \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} [[-,D],D]
  \,.
$$

In this form dualizing objects appear for instance in the definition of [[star-autonomous categories]].

More specifically in [[homological algebra]] and [[stable homotopy theory]] there are typically also certain [[finite object|finiteness conditions]] imposed on a dualizing object $D$ and one speaks of specifically of _[[dualizing modules]]_ (See for instance ([Heard Stojanoska 14, def. 3.1](#HeardStojanoska14) and [[Representability Theorems|Lurie, section 4.2]]). 

Notably in a [[Grothendieck-Verdier context]] $(f^\ast \dashv f_\ast)$, $(f_! \dashv f^!)$ of [[six operations]] the functor $f^!$ typically preserves dualizing objects in this sense, which is a crucial ingredient of [[Verdier duality]]. 

## Examples

### In the category of spectra -- Anderson duality

In the [[stable (infinity,1)-category of spectra]], the [[sphere spectrum]] (which induces [[Spanier-Whitehead duality]] on spectra which are [[dualizable objects]] with respect to the [[smash product of spectra]]) is not a dualizing object, but the [[Anderson spectrum]] $I_{\mathbb{Z}}$ is ([[Representability Theorems|Lurie, Example 4.3.9]]). The [[duality]] operation 
$[-,I_{\mathbb{Z}}]$ that it induces in [[Anderson duality]].

For instance the Anderson dual of [[KU]] is (complex conjugation-equivariantly) the 4-fold [[suspension spectrum]] $\Sigma^4 KU$ ([Heard-Stojanoska 14, theorem 8.2](#HeardStojanoska14)); and [[tmf]] is Anderson self-dual ([Stojanoska 12](#Stojanoska12))
