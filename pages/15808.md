## Idea

In [[physics]] one speakes of a _parent action functional_ ([Deser-Jackiw 84](#DeserJackiw84)) when referring to an [[action functional]] $S_{par}$ which, by solving the [[equations of motion]] of two different sets of its "auxiliary" [[field (physics)|fields]], is classically equivalent to two different-looking action functionals $S_A$ and $S_B$, thereby exhibiting $S_A$ and $S_B$ as classically equivalent to each other. Hence a parent action functional constitutes a [[correspondence]] between two action functionals 

$$
  \array{
    && S_{par}
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{\simeq_{clas}}}\swarrow &&  \searrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq_{clas}}}
    \\
    S_A && && S_B
  }
  \,.
$$

The method is used notably to exhibit "[[duality in physics|duality]]" between $S_A$ and $S_B$ of one form or another, in particular [[electric-magnetic duality]]. (See e.g. [Miao-Ohta 03](#MiaOhta03)).

Beware that some authors also speak of _master actions_ instead of _parent actions_ in this context, but there is not relation to "master actions" in the sense of [[BV-BRST formalism]] (except, of course, that both are [[action functionals]] of some sort).
