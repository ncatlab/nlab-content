## Idea

An _infinitesimal extension_ of a [[ring]] $R$ is an [[epimorphism]] $\widehat R \to R$ whose [[kernel]] is a [[nilpotent ideal]], hence a nilpotent [[ring extension]].

If already the product of any two elements in the kernel is zero, this is also called a _square-zero extension_. See also at _[[tangent category]]_ and at _[[Mod]]_ for more on this.

## Examples

For a [[Noetherian ring]] $R$ (for instance a [[finitely generated ring]]), the projection from $R$ to its [[reduced ring]] $R_{red}$ is an example of an infinitesimal extension. In general, however, the kernel of $R\to R_{red}$ is not nilpotent.

Infinitesimal neighborhoods of subvarieties play role in completion of subvarieties and various definitions of [[formal schemes]], the ring case of course plays a role, cf.
