## Idea

In [[physics]] an _instanton_ is a [[configuration space|field configuration]] with a "topological twist": not in the connected component of the trivial field configurations.

The term derives from the special case of instantons on a [[sphere]] but modeled as field configurations on a [[Euclidean space]] constrained to vanish asymptotically. These look like solutions localized in [[spacetime]]: "at an instant".
