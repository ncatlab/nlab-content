**Warning** on terminology: This is unrelated to the notion of _[[type]]_ in [[type theory]]. 

## Idea

In [[model theory]], an $n$-type is a set of [[first-order logic|first order formulas]] $p(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ in a language $L$ with $n$ free variables $x_1,\ldots,x_n$, which are true for some sequence of $n$-elements of an $L$-structure $M$ substituted for $x_1,\ldots,x_n$. One often limits consideration to the models $M$ of a given $L$-[[theory]] $T$.

A type is said to be _complete_ if it is a maximally consistent set of $L$-formulas.

Complete types correspond to ultrafilters of definable sets. By [[Stone duality]], the set of all $n$-types of a theory $T$ inherits a Stone topology, and is called the _Stone space_ $S_n(T)$ of the theory $T$.

There are some extension of this notion of type beyond first order, for example the notion of [[Galois type]]s in [[infinitary logic]], which is particularly important i the study of [[abstract elementary class]]es.  

An important method toward classification of theories is study of the number of nonisomorphic models in each cardinality; its study if related to the study of types, 
and the phenomenon of [[forking]] in model theory; that aspect is studied in [[stability theory]]. 

## More heuristics

The simplest first order theories are generalizations of algebraic geometry where points correspond to special (e.g. maximal, prime) ideals in a ring; types generalize points in some of such cases. Other "spectral" intuition also applies. 

Finally, one may expand the model $M$ a larger model $M'$. The elements of automorphism group of the larger model will move the "points" around and a type will become an orbit for the larger model $M'$. This point of view is used especially for the generalization, so called [[Galois type]]s.
