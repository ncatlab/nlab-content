## Idea

For $X$ a [[space]] equipped with a notion of [[dimension]] $dim X \in \mathbb{N}$ and a notion of [[Kähler differential forms]], 
a _$\Theta$-characteristic of $X$ is a choice of [[square root]] of the [[canonical characteristic class]] of $X$. See there for more details.

## Examples

### Over Riemann surfaces
 {#OverRiemannSurfaces}

For $X$ a [[Riemann surface]], the choices of [[square roots]] of the [[canonical bundle]] correspond to the choice of [[spin structures]] ([Atiyah, prop. 3.2](#Atiyah)). For $X$ of [[genus of a surface|genus]] $g$, there are $2^{2g}$ many choices of square roots of the canonical bundle. 

The function that sends a square root line bundle to the [[dimension]] of its space of [[holomorphic sections]] $mod 2$ is a [[quadratic refinement]] of the [[intersection pairing]] on $H^1(X, \mathbb{Z}_2)$ ([Atiyah, theorem 2](#Atiyah)).

### Over intermediate Jacobians

A special square root of the canonical bundle on [[intermediate Jacobians]] in dimension $2k+1$ thought of as [[moduli spaces]] of (flat) [[circle n-bundles with connection|circle (2k+1)-bundles with connection]] yields the [[partition function]] of [[self-dual higher gauge theory]].  ([Witten 96](#Witten96), [Hopkins-Singer 02](#HopkinsSinger02)).
