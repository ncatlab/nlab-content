## Idea

For $X$ a [[space]] equipped with a notion of [[dimension]] $dim X \in \mathbb{N}$ and a notion of [[Kähler differential forms]], 
a _$\Theta$-characteristic of $X$ is a choice of [[square root]] of the [[canonical characteristic class]] of $X$. See there for more details.

In [[complex analytic geometry]] and at least if the Theta characteristic is [[polarized variety|principally polarizing]] then its [[holomorphic sections]] are called [[theta functions]]. In particular for line bundles over the [[Jacobian variety]] of a [[Riemann surface]] they are called _[[Riemann theta functions]]_.

## Examples

###### Proposition

For $\Sigma$ a [[Riemann surface]], the choices of [[square roots]] of the [[canonical bundle]] correspond to the choice of [[spin structures]].

For $X$ of [[genus of a surface|genus]] $g$, there are $2^{2g}$ many choices of square roots of the canonical bundle.

###### Remark

The first statement remains true in higher dimensions over [[Kähler manifolds]], see at  _[Spin structure -- On Kähler manifolds](spin%20structure#OverAKahlerManifold)_.

###### Proposition

The function that sends a square root line bundle to the [[dimension]] of its space of [[holomorphic sections]] $mod \;2$ is a [[quadratic refinement]] of the [[intersection pairing]] on $H^1(X, \mathbb{Z}_2)$.

This is due to ([Atiyah, theorem 2](#Atiyah)). A motivational survey in broader context of [[quadratic refinements]] of the [[intersection pairing]] in higher dimensions is in ([Hopkins-Singer 02, section 2.1](#HopkinsSinger02)).


### As metaplectic and Spin structure over (Kähler-)polarized varieties
 {#AsMetaplecticCorretionOfKählerPolarizations}

In the context of [[geometric quantization]] a [[metaplectic structure]] on a [[polarization]] is a [[square root]] of a certain line bundle. In the special case of [[Kähler polarization]] this is a square root precisely of the [[canonical line bundle]] of the underlying [[complex manifold]] and hence is a $\Theta$-characteristic. Also, equivalently this is a [[Spin structure]], see at _[spin structure -- Over a Kähler manifold](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/spin%20structure#OverAKahlerManifold)_. For more on this see at _[geometric quantization -- Quantum states as index of Dolbeault-Dirac operator](geometric+quantization#IndexOfDolbeaultDiracOperator)_.

Notice that generalizing from [[complex analytic geometry]] to [[algebraic geometry]] over other bases, then the analog of a [[Kähler polarization]] is a _[[polarized variety]]_. Hence a choice of [[Theta characteristic]] on a [[polarized variety]] is the analog of a metaplectically corrected Kähler manifold.

### Over intermediate Jacobians
 {#OverIntermediateJacobians}

A special square root of the canonical bundle on [[intermediate Jacobians]] in dimension $2k+1$ thought of as [[moduli spaces]] of (flat) [[circle n-bundles with connection|circle (2k+1)-bundles with connection]] has a unique [[section]] the [[partition function]] of abelian [[self-dual higher gauge theory]] (see there for details).  ([Witten 96](#Witten96), [Hopkins-Singer 02](#HopkinsSinger02)).
