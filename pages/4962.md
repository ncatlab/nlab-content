## Idea

Given a [[category]] $Sp$ of [[space]]s equipped with a [[forgetful functor]] $\Gamma : Sp \to Set$ to [[Set]] thought of as producing for each space its underlying set of points, a **codiscrete space** ([[codiscrete object]]) $Codisc(S)$ on a [[set]] $S$ is, if it exists, the image under the [[right adjoint]] $Codisc : Set \to Sp$ of $\Gamma$.

The dual concept is that of [[discrete space]].

## Examples

### Codiscrete topological spaces

For $\Gamma : Top \to Set$ the obvious  forgetful functor from [[Top]], a codiscrete space is a set with [[codiscrete topology]].

### Codiscrete cohesive spaces

A general axiomatization of the notion of space is as an object in a [[cohesive topos]]. This comes by definition with an underlying-set-functor (or similar) and a [[left adjoint]] that produces discrete cohesive structure. See there for details.
