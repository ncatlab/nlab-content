A [[subspace]] $A$ of a [[space]] $X$ is __almost open__ if it is [[open subspace|open]] modulo the $\sigma$-[[sigma-ideal|ideal]] of [[meagre subspace|meagre subspaces]].  We also say that $A$ has the __Baire property__.

Explicitly, $A$ is almost open if there exist an open subspace $G$ and an [[infinite sequences]] $N_1,N_2,\ldots$ of [[nowhere dense subspace|nowhere dense subspaces]] (meaning that their closures have empty interiors) such that
$$ A \cup \bigcup_i N_i = G \cup \bigcup_i N_i .$$

That every subspace of the [[real line]] is almost open follows from the [[axiom of determinacy]] but contradicts the [[axiom of choice]].  In the absence of choice, it is a convenient assumption to make and is one of the axioms of [[dream mathematics]].
