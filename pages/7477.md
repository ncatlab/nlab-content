## Definition

A **completely distributive lattice** is a 

* [[complete lattice]]

* in which arbitrary [[joins]] and arbitrary meets [[distributive lattice|distribute]] over each other.

## Properties

### Algebraic lattices

###### Proposition


The category of [[Alexandroff locales]] is equivalent to that of completely distributive [[algebraic lattice]]s.

This appears as ([Caramello, remark 4.3](#Caramello)).


### Constructive complete distributivity

A complete lattice is called **constructive completely distributive** if the join-assigning morphism $D A \to A$, with $D A$ the poset of [[downsets]].  This is equivalent to complete distributivity if and only if the [[axiom of choice]] holds; see ([WoodFawcett](#WoodFawcett)).  Constructive completely distributive lattices are an example of [[continuous algebras]] for a [[lax-idempotent 2-monad]].
