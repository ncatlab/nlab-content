## Definition

A **completely distributive lattice** is a 

* [[complete lattice]]

* in which arbitrary [[joins]] and arbitrary meets [[distributive lattice|distribute]] over each other.

## Properties

### Algebraic lattices

###### Proposition


The category of [[Alexandroff locales]] is equivalent to that of completely distributive [[algebraic lattice]]s.

This appears as ([Caramello, remark 4.3](#Caramello)).


### Constructive complete distributivity

A complete lattice is called **constructively completely distributive** (CCD) if the join-assigning morphism $D A \to A$ has a left adjoint, with $D A$ the poset of [[downsets]]. This generalizes to the concept of [[total category|totality]] for small categories.

_Constructive complete distributivity is equivalent to complete distributivity if and only if the [[axiom of choice]] holds_ (cf. [Wood&Fawcett 1990](#WoodFawcett)).

Constructively completely distributive lattices are an example of [[continuous algebras]] for a [[lax-idempotent 2-monad]].

### Remark

Completely distributive lattices correspond to tight [[Galois connections]] (Raney 1953). This generalizes to a correspondence between totally distributive toposes and [[essential geometric morphism|essential localizations]] (Lucyshyn-Wright 2011).
