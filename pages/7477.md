## Definition

A **completely distributive lattice** is a [[complete lattice]] in which arbitrary [[joins]] and arbitrary meets [[distributive lattice|distribute]] over each other.

## Properties

### Algebraic lattices

###### Proposition

The category of [[Alexandroff locales]] is equivalent to that of completely distributive [[algebraic lattice|algebraic lattices]].

This appears as remark 4.3 in ([Caramello 2011](#Caramello11)).

### Constructive complete distributivity

A complete lattice $A$ is called **constructively completely distributive** (CCD) if the join-assigning morphism $D A \to A$ has a left adjoint, with $D A$ the poset of [[downsets]]. 

_Constructive complete distributivity is equivalent to complete distributivity if and only if the [[axiom of choice]] holds_ ([Wood&Fawcett (1990)](#WoodFawcett)).

Constructively completely distributive lattices are an example of [[continuous algebras]] for a [[lax-idempotent 2-monad]].

### Remark

Completely distributive lattices correspond to tight [[Galois connections]] (Raney 1953). This generalizes to a correspondence between totally distributive toposes and [[essential geometric morphism|essential localizations]] (Lucyshyn-Wright 2011).

CCD lattices are precisely the [[nuclear objects]] in the category of complete lattices. 

The (bi-) category $\mathfrak{CCD}$ with CCD lattices and sup-preserving maps is the [[Karoubi envelope|idempotent splitting]] of the (bi-) category of relations $\mathfrak{Rel}$. This plays an important role in _[[domain]]-theoretical_ approaches to the semantics of [[linear logic]].
