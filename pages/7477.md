## Definition

A **completely distributive lattice** is a [[complete lattice]] in which arbitrary [[joins]] and arbitrary meets [[distributive lattice|distribute]] over each other.

## Properties

### Algebraic lattices

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The category of [[Alexandroff locales]] is equivalent to that of completely distributive [[algebraic lattice|algebraic lattices]]. 
=--

This appears as remark 4.3 in ([Caramello 2011](#Caramello11)).

### Completely distributive Boolean algebras 

+-- {: .num_prop} 
###### Proposition 
A complete Boolean algebra $B$ is completely distributive iff it is atomic (a [[CABA]]), i.e., is a [[power set]] as a Boolean algebra. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
For a complete atomic Boolean algebra $B$, it is classical that the canonical map $B \to P(atoms(B))$, sending each $b \in B$ to the set of atoms below it, is an isomorphism. Such power sets are products of copies of $\mathbf{2} = \{0 \leq 1\}$, which is completely distributive (as is any complete [[total order|totally ordered]] set), and products of completely distributive lattices are completely distributive. 

In the other direction, if $B$ is completely distributive, then we may write 

$$1 = \bigwedge_{b \in B} (b \vee \neg b) = \bigvee_{f: B \to \mathbf{2}} \bigwedge_{b \in B} \alpha(f(b), b)$$ 

where we define $\alpha(0, b) \coloneqq \neg b$ and $\alpha(1, b) \coloneqq b$. Write $a(f)$ as an abbreviation of $\bigwedge_{b \in B} \alpha(f(b), b)$. We have 

$$b = b \wedge 1 = b \wedge \bigvee_{f: B \to \mathbf{2}} a(f) = \bigvee_{f: B \to \mathbf{2}} b \wedge a(f)$$ 

so $b \wedge a(f) \neq 0$ for some $f$ if $b \neq 0$. Notice that $b \wedge a(f) \neq 0$ implies $f(b) = 1$, from which we infer two things: 

* Whenever $b \leq a(f)$ with $b \neq 0$, then $a(f) \leq \alpha(f(b), b) = \alpha(1, b) = b$; therefore $a(f)$ is an [[atom]] whenever $a(f) \neq 0$; 

* Provided that $b \wedge a(f) \neq 0$, the preceding point gives that $a(f)$ is an atom below $b \wedge a(f) \leq b$. 

The last point shows every element $b$ has an atom $a(f)$ below it, so that $B$ is atomic, as was to be shown.

### Constructive complete distributivity

A complete lattice $A$ is called **constructively completely distributive** (CCD) if the join-assigning morphism $D A \to A$ has a left adjoint, with $D A$ the poset of [[downsets]]. 

_Constructive complete distributivity is equivalent to complete distributivity if and only if the [[axiom of choice]] holds_ ([Wood&Fawcett (1990)](#WoodFawcett)).

Constructively completely distributive lattices are an example of [[continuous algebras]] for a [[lax-idempotent 2-monad]].

### Remark

Completely distributive lattices correspond to tight [[Galois connections]] (Raney 1953). This generalizes to a correspondence between totally distributive toposes and [[essential geometric morphism|essential localizations]] (Lucyshyn-Wright 2011).

CCD lattices are precisely the [[nuclear objects]] in the category of complete lattices. 

The (bi-) category $\mathfrak{CCD}$ with CCD lattices and sup-preserving maps is the [[Karoubi envelope|idempotent splitting]] of the (bi-) category of relations $\mathfrak{Rel}$. This plays an important role in _[[domain]]-theoretical_ approaches to the semantics of [[linear logic]].
