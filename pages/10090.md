## Idea

The [[tachyon]] mode in the [[open string|open]] [[bosonic string]] spectrum is an indication that as a [[perturbation theory]] it describes the perturbation about an _unstable_ [[vacuum]] which will [[vacuum decay|decay]] via [[tachyon condensation]]. [[Ashoke Sen]] realized ([Sen 99](#Sen99)) that since the open string technically propagates with its endpoints on the space filling [[D25-brane]], that instability must be the instability of the D25, which wants to decay to a "true bosonic string vacuum", often called the _tachyon vacuum_.

This conjecture became famous as **Sen's conjecture**. It was subsequently checked to be true by numerical means in [[open bosonic string field theory]]. Moreover, using string field theory it became possible to study that non-perturbative state in which the [[D25-brane]] is indeed gone. There were several arguments that indeed in the vicinity of this state the perturbative open string has disappeared and turned into the closed bosonic string.

A breakthrough happened in 2005, when [[Martin Schnabl]] found an analytic expression for this "tachyon vacuum" ([Schnabl 05](#Schnabl05)).

On the other hand, in [[superstring theory]] tachyons modes appear for strings stretching between a [[D-brane]] and an [[anti-D-brane]]. The analog of Sen's conjecture here states that the consensation of the tachyon witnesses the annihilation of the brane/anti-brane pair ([Sen 98](#Sen98)). This is one major motivation for the conjecture that [[D-brane charge]] is [[Dirac charge quantization|charge quantized]] in [[topological K-theory]] ([Witten 98, Section 3](D-brane#Witten98)).
