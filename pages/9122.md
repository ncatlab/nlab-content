## Idea

In a context of [[differential cohesion]] the _infinitesimal shape modality_ characterizes [[coreduced objects]]. It is itself the [[right adjoint]] in an [[adjoint modality]] with the [[reduction modality]] and the [[left adjoint]] in an [[adjoint modality]] with the [[infinitesimal flat modality]].

## Definition

A context of [[differential cohesion]] is determined by the existence of an [[adjoint triple]] of  [[modalities]]

$$
  Red \dashv &#643;_{inf} \dashv \flat_{inf}
  \,,
$$

where $Red$ and $\flat_{inf}$ are [[idempotent monad|idempotent]] [[comonads]] and $&#643;_{inf}$ is an [[idempotent monad]].

Here $&#643;_{inf}$ is the **infinitesimal shape modality**. The [[reflective subcategory]] that it defines is that of [[coreduced objects]].

## Properties

### Relation to de Rham spaces

For $X$ a [[geometric homotopy type]], the result of applying the infinitesimal shape modality yields a type $&#643;_{inf} X$ which has the interpretation of the [[de Rham space]] of $X$. See there for more.

### Relation to jet bundles

For $E$ a [[dependent type]] on $X$, its [[dependent product]] along the [[unit of a monad|unit]] of the infinitesimal shape modality has the interpretation of the [[jet type]] $j(E)$. See there for more.

### Relation to crystalline cohomology

The [[cohomology]] of $&#643;_{inf} X$ has the interpretation of [[crystalline cohomology]] of $X$. See there for more.
