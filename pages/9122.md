## Idea

In a context of [[differential cohesion]] the _infinitesimal shape modality_ or _étale modality_ $\Im $ characterizes [[coreduced objects]]. It is itself the [[right adjoint]] in an [[adjoint modality]] with the [[reduction modality]] and the [[left adjoint]] in an [[adjoint modality]] with the [[infinitesimal flat modality]].

## Definition

A context of [[differential cohesion]] is determined by the existence of an [[adjoint triple]] of  [[modalities]]

$$
  \Re \dashv \Im \dashv \&
  \,,
$$

where $\Re$ and $\&$ are [[idempotent monad|idempotent]] [[comonads]] and $\Im $ is an [[idempotent monad]].

Here $\Im $ is the **infinitesimal shape modality**. The [[reflective subcategory]] that it defines is that of [[coreduced objects]].

## Properties

### Relation for formally étale morphisms

The [[modal types]] of $\Im $ in the context of some $X$, i.e. those $(Y\to X) \in \mathbf{H}_{/X}$ for which the naturality square of the $\Im $-[[unit of a monad|unit]] 

$$
  \array{
     Y &\longrightarrow& \Im Y
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     X &\longrightarrow& \Im X
  }
$$
 
is a ([[homotopy pullback|homotopy]]) [[pullback]] square, are the [[formally étale morphisms]] $Y \to X$.

### Relation to de Rham spaces

For $X$ a [[geometric homotopy type]], the result of applying the infinitesimal shape modality yields a type $ \Im X$ which has the interpretation of the [[de Rham space]] of $X$. See there for more.

### Relation to jet bundles

For any object $X$ in [[differential cohesion]], the [[base change]] [[comonad]] $Jet \coloneqq i^\ast i_\ast$ along the [[unit of a monad|unit]] $i \colon X \to \Im X$ has the interpretation of being the [[jet comonad]] which sends [[bundles]] over $X$ to their [[jet bundles]].

### Relation to crystalline cohomology

The [[cohomology]] of $\Im X$ has the interpretation of [[crystalline cohomology]] of $X$. See there for more.
