Bousfield localization is a sophisticated version of the general idea of [[localization]].  We can localize a category by formally inverting certain morphisms: for example, when forming the [[homotopy category]] of a [[model category]], where we invert morphisms called 'weak equivalences'.  But Bousfeld localization is a subtler process.  In the case of a model category, Bousfield localization allows us to *make more morphisms count as weak equivalences*.  There is a related notion of Bousfield localization for [[triangulated categories]].
