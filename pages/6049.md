## Idea

In the context of [[string theory]] the _NS5-brane_ is a certain extended physical objects -- a [[brane]] -- that appears in/is predicted by the theory.

There are different incarnations of this object:

For instance the [[effective QFT|effective background QFT]] of the [[type II string theory|type II string]] -- [[type II supergravity]] -- admits solutions to its generalized [[Einstein equations]] which describe higher dimensional analogs of charged [[black holes]] in ordinary gravity. Among them is a 5+1-dimensional "black brane" which is [[magnetic charge|magnetically charged]] under the [[Kalb-Ramond field]]. Since the KR field and the field of [[gravity]] constituting this solution of type II supergravity have as quanta the [[worldsheet]] excitations of the [[spinning string]] [[sigma-model]] that sit in what is called the [[Neveu-Schwarz sector]] one calls this the **NS5-brane**. 

This is to distinguish it from the [[D-brane|D5-brane]] which is instead charged under the [[RR-field]] whose quanta come from the [[Ramond-Ramond sector]] of the [[superstring]].

There are other incarnations of the NS 5-brane:

by the general logic of [[Kalb-Ramond field|higher electromagnetism]] the (1+1)-dimensional string has under [[electric-magnetic duality]] a _magnetic dual_ . By dimension counting this is a 5-brane. If we think of the string this way as the structure that supports the [[sigma-model]] that defines perturbative [[string theory]],  we also call it the _F1-brane_ (the _fundamental_ 1-brane). In this sense the the corresponding magnetic dual is the _F5-brane_ -- the _fundamental_ fivebrane.

One can understand the NS5-"black brane" solution to [[type II supergravity]] as being the solitonic incarnation of the fundamental 5-brane in much the same way as an ordinary [[black hole]] in ordinary [[gravity]] is a solitonic incarnation of the [[fundamental particle]]: as the particle, the black hole it is characterized just by [[mass]], [[charge]] and [[angular momentum]]. 

Similarly, the "black" NS5-brane is characterizes by [[mass]], [[B-field]] charge and [[angular momentum]]. 


## Properties

### As a black brane

[[!include black branes in supergravity -- table]]


### Relation to little string theory

By the [[brane scan]], on the [[worldvolume]] of an NS5-brane propagates a [[superstring]]. This is called the _[[little string]]_, see there for more.

### Relation to D-branes

There are various intersection laws for [[black brane|black]] NS5-branes with [[black brane|black]] [[D-branes]] ([Callan-Harvey-Strominger 91, sections IV.C and V.B](#CallanHarveyStrominger91), [Brodie-Hanany 97](#BrodieHanany97), [EGKRS 00](#EGKRS00)). The special properties of NS5-branes embedded into [[D6-branes]] were first highlighted in ([Brodie-Hanany 97](#BrodieHanany97)).


Consider a [[black brane|black]] NS5-brane with [[near horizon geometry]] $  \underset{\sim AdS_7}{\underbrace{ \mathbb{R}^{5,1} \times \mathbb{R}_{\phi} }} \times S^3$ ([EGKRS 00, p. 8](#EGKRS00)):

<img src="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/BlackNS5BraneII.png"/>

The [[3-sphere]] factor $S^3$ is the [[unit sphere]] around the black NS5-brane [[worldvolume]] $\mathbb{R}^{5,1}$, and $\mathbb{R}_{\phi}$ parameterizes the radial diastance from it.

Placing a [[D6-brane]] at one point of the $S^3$-factor 

<img src="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/NS5InD6a.png"/>

means to take its [[worldvolume]] to be the factor $\mathbb{R}^{5,1} \times \mathbb{R}_\phi$, hence extending to one side of the NS5-brane:

<img src="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/NS5BoundingD6.png"/>

Placing another [[D6-brane]] at the corresponding antipodal point means to have it extend also to the other side:

### Relation to Khovanov homology

[[Khovanov homology]] has long been expected to appear as the [[observables]] in a 4-[[dimension]]al [[TQFT]] in higher analogy of how the [[Jones polynomial]] arises as an observable in 3-dimensional [[Chern-Simons theory]]. For instance for $\Sigma : K \to K'$ a cobordism between two [[knots]] there is a natural [[morphism]]

$$
  \Phi_\Sigma : \mathcal{K}(K) \to \mathcal{K}(K')
$$

between the Khovanov homologies associated to the two knots.

In ([Witten11](#Witten11)) it is argued, following indications in ([GukovSchwarzVafa](#GukovSchwarzVafa))
that this 4d TQFT is related to the [[worldvolume]] theory of the _image_ in [[type IIA string theory|type IIA]] of [[D3-branes]] ending on NS5-branes in [[type IIB string theory|type IIB]] after one [[S-duality]] and one [[T-duality]] operation:

$$
  (D3 - NS4)
    \stackrel{S}{\mapsto}
  (D3 - D5)
    \stackrel{T}{\mapsto}
  (D4-D6)
  \,.
$$

Earlier indication for this had come from the observation that [[Chern-Simons theory]] is the [[effective QFT|effective background theory]] for the [[A-model]] 2d [[TCFT]] (see [TCFT &#8211; Worldsheet and effective background theories](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/TCFT#ActionFunctionals) for details).

Notice that after the above [[T-duality]] operation the $(D4-D6)$-system wraps the $S^1$ ([[circle]]) along which the T-duality takes place. 

Lifting that configuration to [[11-dimensional supergravity]] gives [[M5-branes]] (the erstwhile [[D4-brane]]s) on [[Taub-NUT spacetime|Taub-NUT]] ($\times S^1$). The [[M5-branes]] wrap the circle-fiber of Taub-NUT, which shrinks to zero size at the origin (the location of the erstwhile D6, which is where the D4s "end"). The low-energy theory, on a stack of M5-branes, is the [[6d (2,0)-susy QFT]].
