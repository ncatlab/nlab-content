##Idea 

**Condensed mathematics** aims to provide a more convenient framework in which to treat algebraic objects equipped with a topology, such as [[topological abelian groups]] and [[topological vector spaces]]. Related aims are to turn [[functional analysis]] into a branch of [[commutative algebra]], and various types of [[analytic geometry]] into [[algebraic geometry]]. 

## Concepts

### Condensed objects

* [[condensed set]]
* [[condensed abelian group]]
* [[condensed ring]]
* [[condensed module]]

#### Solid objects

* [[solid abelian group]]
* [[solid module]]

#### Liquid objects

* [[liquid vector space]]
* [[liquid module]]

#### Other

* [[trace-class map]]
* [[nuclear module]]
* [[analytic ring]]

### Higher condensed objects

* [[condensed infinity-groupoid]]
* [[condensed object in an (infinity,1)-category]]
* [[condensed spectrum]]
* [[condensed E-infinity ring]]
* [[condensed module spectrum]]
