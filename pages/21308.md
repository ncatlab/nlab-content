##Idea 

**Condensed mathematics** aims to provide a more convenient framework in which to treat algebraic objects equipped with a topology, such as [[topological abelian groups]] and [[topological vector spaces]]. Related aims are to turn [[functional analysis]] into a branch of [[commutative algebra]], and various types of [[analytic geometry]] into [[algebraic geometry]]. 

## Concepts

* [[solid module]]
* [[liquid module]]
* [[analytic geometry]]
* [[analytic ring]]
