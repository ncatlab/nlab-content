##Idea 

**Condensed mathematics** aims to provide a more convenient framework in which to treat algebraic objects equipped with a topology, such as [[abelian topological groups]] and [[topological vector spaces]]. Related aims are to turn functional analysis into a branch of commutative algebra, and various types of analytic geometry into algebraic geometry.
