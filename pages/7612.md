## Idea

A certification of a computer program is a formalized guarantee -- a [[proof]] -- that the output of the program has given specified properties -- that it is of a specified [[type]].

Therefore programming languages supporting certified programming are naturally based on [[type theory]]. Examples are _[[Coq]]_ or _[[Agda]]_.
