### Idea ###

A **totally convex space** is, essentially, what you get if you try to build an algebraic theory out of Banach spaces.

### Definition ###

###### Definition
The category of totally convex spaces is the category of modules for the monad on $\operatorname{Set}$ which sends a set $X$ to the closed unit ball of the Banach space $\ell^1(X)$.

This is an example of an [[algebraic theory]] which is not finitary, hence not a [[Lawvere theory]].  The **free** totally convex spaces are the unit balls of the Banach spaces $\ell^1(X)$ and thus an operation in this theory is a formal sum $\sum_{x \in X} a_x$ with $a_x \in \mathbb{R}$ with the property that $\sum_{x \in X} |a_x| \le 1$.  The finiteness of this sum forces it to have only countably many non-zero terms, and thus it factors through an operation on $\mathbb{N}$.  Hence there is a presentation of this theory with operations in $\ell^1(\mathbb{N})$.  The corresponding identities are simply the substitution rules - namely that substituting a sum into another works as expected - and the reordering rules.

### Properties ###

1. A totally convex space is a pointed convex space.  The operations of a convex space are encoded in the operations $(r, 1 - r, 0,0,0, \dots)$ and the "point" comes from the operation $(0,0,\dots)$.  This functor preserves underlying sets and so has a left adjoint; thus any convex space can be "completed" to a totally convex space.

1. The operations for this theory are [[commutative algebraic theory|commutative]], hence the category of totally convex spaces is a closed symmetric monoidal category.

### Examples ###

1. Clearly, the closed unit ball of a Banach space is a totally convex space; indeed, these are the free totally convex spaces.

1. Bizarrely, the **open** unit ball of a Banach space is a totally convex space.  This is because of the fact that if a sum, $\sum_{x \in B X} a_x x$ lies on the boundary of $B X$ then every $x$ for which $a_x \ne 0$ must have norm $1$.  Thus if the series only contains terms from the interior of $B X$, the sum remains in the interior.  Hence the open unit ball is a subalgebra of the closed unit ball.

1. Continuing, the quotient of the closed unit ball by the open unit ball is a totally convex space.

1. In particular, the three point space $\{-1,0,1\}$ is a totally convex space.  The operations on this space are as follows:

   $$
   \sum a_j \epsilon_j = \begin{cases}
   1 & \epsilon_j = \operatorname{sign}(a_j), \sum |a_j| = 1 \\
   -1 & \epsilon_j = -\operatorname{sign}(a_j), \sum |a_j| = 1 \\
   0 & \;\text{otherwise}
   \end{cases}
   $$

1. Going back one step, $(-1,1)$ is a totally convex space.   It is illuminating to describe this as a coequaliser of free totally convex spaces.  Consider a functional $f \colon \ell^1(\mathbb{N}) \to \mathbb{R}$ which is bounded of norm $1$ but does not achieve its norm.  For example, let $f$ be represented by the sequence $(\frac12,\frac23,\frac34,\dots)$.  Then for any $x \in B\ell^1(\mathbb{N})$, $f(x) \in (-1,1)$.  Thus $(-1,1)$ is the coequaliser of the inclusion $\ker f \to \ell^1(\mathbb{N})$ and the zero map $\ker f \to \ell^1(\mathbb{N})$.
