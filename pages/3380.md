## Idea

Essentially, the totally convex spaces are what you get if you try to build an [[algebraic theory]] of [[Banach spaces]].


## Definition

###### Abstract definition
A __totally convex space__ is a [[module for a monad|module]] for the [[monad]] on [[Set]] which sends a set $X$ to the closed unit ball of the Banach space $\ell^1(X)$.

This is an example of an [[algebraic theory]] (in the strong sense that it is [[monadic category|bounded monadic]]) but not finitary, hence not a [[Lawvere theory]].  The [[free object|free]] totally convex space on $X$ is the unit ball of the Banach space $\ell^1(X)$, and thus an operation in this theory is a formal sum $\sum_{x \in X} a_x x$ for $a_x \in \mathbb{R}$ with the property that $\sum_{x \in X} {|a_x|} \le 1$.  The finiteness of this sum forces it to have only countably many non-zero terms, and thus it factors through an operation on $\mathbb{N}$.  Hence there is a presentation of this theory with operations in $\ell^1(\mathbb{N})$ (which is why the theory is *bounded* monadic).  The corresponding identities are simply the substitution rules -- namely that substituting a sum into another works as expected -- and the reordering rules.

###### Concrete definition
A __totally convex space__ is a set $X$ equipped with, for each [[infinite sequence]] $(a_1, a_2, \ldots)$ of [[real numbers]] such that $\sum_i {|a_i|} \leq 1$, an operation from $X^{\mathbb{N}}$ to $X$, written $(x_1,x_2,\ldots) \mapsto \sum_i a_i x_i$, such that:

1.  Reordering:  If $\sigma$ is any [[permutation]] of $\mathbb{N}$, then $\sum_i a_i x_i = \sum_i a_{\sigma(i)} x_{\sigma(i)}$;
2.  Nullary substitution:  If $\delta_i$ is the [[Kronecker delta]] at $0$ (so $\delta_i = 0$ normally, but $\delta_0 = 1$), then $\sum_i \delta_i x_i = x_0$;
3.  Binary substitution:  If the functions $\pi,\rho\colon \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ express $\mathbb{N}$ as its own [[product]] with itself (it is enough to pick one pair of functions and state this axiom only for it), then $\sum_i a_i (\sum_j b_{i,j} x_{i,j}) = \sum_k a_{\pi(k)} b_{\pi(k),\rho(k)} x_{\pi(k),\rho(k)}$.

Of course, one would normally write the right-hand side of the last equation as $\sum_{i,j} a_i b_{i,j} x_{i,j}$, but that is not technically an operation in the theory, except as mediated by $\pi$ and $\rho$.  A common choice for $(\pi,\rho)$ is the [[inverse]] of $(i,j) \mapsto \big({i + j + 1 \atop 2}\big) + j$, where for this expression to work we take $0$ to be a natural number.

I haven\'t actually checked that this list is complete; but it\'s what I get if I take Andrew at his word that we need only substitution and reordering rules.  I wouldn\'t be terribly surprised if nullary substitution is redundant, but right now I don\'t see how.  ---Toby

## Properties

1. A totally convex space is a [[pointed object|pointed]] [[convex space]].  The operations of a convex space are encoded in the operations $(r, 1 - r, 0, 0, 0, \ldots)$ and the "point" comes from the operation $(0, 0, \ldots)$.  This functor preserves underlying sets and so has a [[left adjoint]]; thus any convex space can be "completed" to a totally convex space.

1. The operations for this theory are [[commutative algebraic theory|commutative]], hence the [[category]] of totally convex spaces is a [[closed monoidal category|closed]] [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal]] category.


## Examples

1. Clearly, the closed unit ball $B X$ of any Banach space $X$ is a totally convex space.

1. Bizarrely, the **open** unit ball of a Banach space is a totally convex space.  This is because if a sum, $\sum_{x \in B X} a_x x$ for $\sum_x {|a_x|} \leq 1$, lies on the boundary of $B X$ then every $x$ for which $a_x \ne 0$ must have norm $1$.  Thus if the series only contains terms from the interior of $B X$, the sum remains in the interior.  Hence the open unit ball is a [[subalgebra]] of the closed unit ball.

1. Continuing, the quotient of the closed unit ball by the open unit ball is a totally convex space.

1. In particular, the three-point space $\{-1,0,1\}$ is (assuming [[excluded middle]]) a totally convex space.  The operations on this space are as follows:

   $$
   \sum a_j \epsilon_j = \begin{cases}
   1 & \epsilon_j = \operatorname{sign}(a_j), \sum {|a_j|} = 1 \\
   -1 & \epsilon_j = -\operatorname{sign}(a_j), \sum {|a_j|} = 1 \\
   0 & \;\text{otherwise}
   \end{cases}
   $$

1. Going back one step, $(-1,1)$ is a totally convex space.   It is illuminating to describe this as a [[coequaliser]] of free totally convex spaces.  Consider a functional $f \colon \ell^1(\mathbb{N}) \to \mathbb{R}$ which is bounded of norm $1$ but does not achieve its norm; for example, let $f$ be represented by the sequence $(\frac{1}{2},\frac{2}{3},\frac{3}{4},\ldots)$.  Then for any $x \in B\ell^1(\mathbb{N})$, $f(x) \in (-1,1)$.  Thus $(-1,1)$ is the coequaliser of the inclusion $\ker f \to \ell^1(\mathbb{N})$ and the [[zero map]] $\ker f \to \ell^1(\mathbb{N})$.
