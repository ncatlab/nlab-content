## Idea

An _$E_\infty$-monoid_ (or _E-infinity monoid object_) in a [[symmetric monoidal model category]] $C$ is an [[algebra over an operad]] over the [[E-infinity operad]].
Assuming that $C$ is [[cofibrantly generated model category|cofibrantly generated]], there is a model structure on $E_\infty$-monoids, given by the [[model structure on algebras over an operad]] over the [[E-infinity operad]] (which is [[cofibrant]]).
This [[model category]] presents the [[(infinity,1)-category]] of [[commutative monoids in a symmetric monoidal (infinity,1)-category]] (in the [[symmetric monoidal (infinity,1)-category]] presented by $C$).

## Rectification

In some [[symmetric monoidal model categories]], $E_\infty$-monoids can be rectified to (strictly) [[commutative monoids in a symmetric monoidal model category]].
See there for more.
