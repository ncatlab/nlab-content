## Idea

A _holonomy groupoid_ is a ([[topological groupoid|topological]]/[[Lie groupoid|Lie]]-)[[groupoid]] naturally associated with a [[foliation]] $ \mathcal{F} $ of a [[manifold]] $ X $. It is, in some sense, the smallest de-singularization of the [[leaf space]] [[quotient]] $ X/\mathcal{F} $ of the foliation, which is, in general, not a manifold itself. Every [[foliation groupoid]] of $ \mathcal{F} $ has this de-singularization property, but the holonomy groupoid is, in some sense, minimal with respect to this property.

Explicitly, given a (Riemannian) [[foliation]] $ F $ on a manifold $ X $, the _holonomy groupoid_ of $ F $ has as objects the points of $ X $. Given points $ x,y $ lying on the same leaf, a morphism between them is the equivalence class of a path in the leaf from $ x $ to $ y $, where two paths are identified if they induce the same [[germ]] of a holonomy transformation between small transversal subspaces at $ x $ and $ y $. If $ x $ and $ y $ are not on the same leaf, then there is no morphism between them.

This is naturally a [[topological groupoid]] and a [[Lie groupoid]] if done right.

The **monodromy groupoid** of the foliation is obtained from this by further dividing out [[homotopy]] between paths in a leaf.

## Definition

### Foliation Holonomy

Let $ (X,\mathcal{F}) $ be a foliated manifold with $ q = codim(\mathcal{F}) $. Let $ L $ be a leaf of $ \mathcal{F} $; let $ x,y \in L $ be two points; and let $ S $ be a transversal section through $ x $ and $ T $ a transversal section through $ y $ (so $ S $ and $ T $ are sub-manifolds transversal to the leaves of $ \mathcal{F} $).

To a path $ \gamma: [0,1] \to L $ from $ x $ to $ y $, associate the [[germ]] of a (partially defined) [[diffeomorphism]]

$$
{hol^{S,T}}(\gamma): (S,x) \to (T,y),
$$

called the **holonomy** of the path $ \gamma $ with respect to $ S $ and $ T $, as follows.

If there exists a foliation chart $ U $ of $ \mathcal{F} $ that contains the whole path, then there exists an open [[neighbourhood]] $ A $ of $ x $ in $ S \cap U $ on which there is a unique smooth map $ f: A \to T $ satisfying the following conditions:

1. $ f(x) = y $;

2. For every $ a \in A $, the point $ f(a) $ lies in the same plaque in $ U $ as $ a $. We can choose $ A $ sufficiently small so that $ f $ is an actual [[diffeomorphism]] onto its image. Then define $ {hol^{S,T}}(\gamma) $ to be the [[germ]] of this diffeomorphism at $ x $:

$$
{hol^{S,T}}(\gamma) {:=} {germ_{x}}(f) \,.
$$

In general, the path $ \gamma $ is not contained inside a single foliation chart $ U $, but as $ \gamma $ is compact, there exist finitely many foliation charts $ U_{1},\ldots,U_{n+1} $ and numbers $ t_{0},\ldots,t_{n+1} $ such that

(i) $ 0 = t_{0} \le t_{1} \le \cdots \le t_{n} \le t_{n+1} = 1 $ and

(ii) $ \gamma|_{[t_{i-1},t_{i}]} $ is contained in $ U_{i} $ for $ i = 1,\ldots,n+1 $.

Next, choose transversal sections $ T_{i} $ to $ \mathcal{F} $ at $ \gamma(t_{i}) $ for $ i = 1,\ldots,n $ and define

$$
      hol^{S,T}(\gamma) 
{:=}
      {hol^{T_{n-1},T}}(\gamma|_{[t_{n-1},t_{n}]})
      \circ \cdots \circ
      hol^{T_{1},T_{2}}(\gamma|_{[t_{1},t_{2}]})
      \circ \cdots \circ 
      hol^{S,T_{1}}(\gamma|_{[0,t_{1}]}) \,.
$$ 

This definition is independent of the choice of the $ U_{i} $'s and the $ t_{i} $'s, and it only depends on the initial and final transversal sections $ S $ and $ T $.

**Proposition**

* Two homotopic paths with the same endpoints induce the same holonomy. The converse is not true: Two paths with the same endpoints inducing the same holonomy may not be homotopic.

* If $ S,S' $ are two transversal sections through $ x $ and $ T,T' $ two transversal sections through $ y $, then

$$
   hol^{S',T'}(\gamma)
= 
   {hol^{T,T'}}(const_{y})
   \circ {hol^{S,T}}(\gamma) \circ {hol^{S',S}}(const_{x}) \,.
$$

### Holonomy Groupoid

Given a foliated manifold $ (X,\mathcal{F}) $, the **monodromy groupoid** is the [[disjoint union]] of the [[fundamental groupoids]] of the leaves of $ \mathcal{F} $, which is the groupoid having the following properties:

1. Its objects are the points of $ X $.

2. There are no morphisms between two points on different leaves.

3. The morphisms between two points on the same leaf are [[homotopy]]-classes of paths lying in the leaf joining those points.

The **holonomy groupoid** is defined analogously, where instead of identifying two paths if they are homotopic, they are identified if they induce the same holonomy as described above.
