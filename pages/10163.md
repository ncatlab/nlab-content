
## Definition

Given a [[linear map|linear]] [[endomorphism]], an _eigenvector_ of it is a [[vector]] which is taken by the linear map to a multiple of itself. This multiple is called the _[[eigenvalue]]_ of the eigenvector.

If the linear map acts as a [[differential operator]] on a space of functions, its eigenvectors are sometimes called **eigenfunctions**.
