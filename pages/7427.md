[[!redirects well-generated triangular category]]

##Idea

The notion of well-generated [[triangulated category]] was introduced by Neeman in _Triangulated Categories_ and appears to be the "appropriate generalization of [[compactly generated]] for triangulated categories," (Krause).  The following definition is from Henning Krause's paper _On Neeman's Well Generated Triangulated Categories_ and it somewhat shorter and more natural than Neeman's original definition.

##Definition

Let $T$ be a triangulated category with arbitrary [[coproducts]]. Then $T$ is well-generated in the sense of Neeman if and only if there exists a set $S_0$ of objects satisfying:

1. an object $X$ of $T$ is zero if [S,X]=0 for all $S\in S_0$;
1. for every set of maps $X_i\to Y_i$ in $T$, the induced map $[S,\coprod_I X_i]\to[S,\coprod_I Y_i]$ is surjective for all $S\in S_0$ whenever $[S,X_i]\to[S,Y_i]$ is surjective for all $i$ and all $S\in S_0$. 
1. the objects of $S_0$ are $\alpha$-[[small]] for some cardinal $\alpha$.  

We recall that to say an object $S$ is $\alpha$-small is to say that every map $S\to\coprod_I X_i$ factors through some $S\to\coprod_J X_j$ where $\vert J\vert$ < $\alpha$.
