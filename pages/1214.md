A __Mal'cev category__ is a [[finitely complete category|left exact category]] (= having finite limits) in which any reflexive relation is an [[congruence|equivalence relation]]. Equivalently, the fibers of its [[fibration of points]] are unital (equivalently the fibers of the fibration of points are strongly unital). 

Examples include the category of groups, and in fact the category of $T$-algebras for any [[Lawvere theory|theory]] $T$ which contains a group operation. Other examples include the category $Heyt$ of [[Heyting algebra]]s and the category of left closed [[magma]]s. The dual category to an [[elementary topos]] is a Mal'cev category. 

In any Mal'cev category, every [[internal category]] is a [[groupoid]].
