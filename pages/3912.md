## Idea

For $H$ being [[ordinary cohomology]] with [[coefficients]] in a [[ring]], and $V \to X$ a [[vector bundle]] of rank $n$ over a simply connected CW-complex, the **Thom isomorphism** is the morphism
 
$$
  c \cup (-)
    \;\colon\; 
  H^\bullet(X) 
     \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} 
  \tilde H^{\bullet + n}(Th(V))
  \,.
$$

from the [[cohomology]] of $X$ to the [[reduced cohomology]] of the [[Thom space]] $Th(V)$, given by pullback to the [[Thom space]] followed by [[cup product]] with a [[Thom class]] $c \in H^n(Th(V))$. That this is indeed an [[isomorphism]] follows via the [[Leray-Hirsch theorem]] (see e.g. [Ebert 12, 2.3,2.4](#Ebert12)) or from running a [[Serre spectral sequence]] (e.g. [Kochmann 96, section 2.6](#Kochmann96)).


More generally for $E$ a [[multiplicative cohomology theory]], and $V \to X$ a [[vector bundle]] of rank $n$, which is $E$-[[orientation in generalized cohomology|orientable]], there is a generalization to a  **Thom-Dold isomorphism** 
 
$$
  c \cup (-)
    \;\colon\; 
  E^\bullet(X) 
     \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} 
  \tilde E^{\bullet + n}(Th(V))
$$

(e.g. [Rudyak 98, chapter V, 1.3](#Rudyak98), [Kochmann 96, prop. 4.3.6](#Kochmann96))

One may think of the Thom isomorphism from left to right as [[cup product|cupping]] with a generalized [[volume form]] on the fibers, and from right to left as performing [[fiber integration]] against this volume form.

## Statement

### Concretely

#### In ordinary cohomology

+-- {: .num_prop #Smooth0TypeIsSheavesOnSmoothMfd}
###### Proposition

Let $V \to B$ be a topological [[vector bundle]] of [[rank]] $n \gt 0$ over a [[simply connected topological space|simply connected]] [[CW-complex]] $B$. Let $R$ be a [[commutative ring]]. 

There exists an element $c \in H^n(Th(V);R)$ (in the [[ordinary cohomology]], with [[coefficients]] in $R$, of the [[Thom space]] of $V$, called a **[[Thom class]]**) such that forming the [[cup product]] with $c$ induces an [[isomorphism]]

$$
  H^\bullet(B;R)
    \overset{c \cup (-)}{\longrightarrow}
  \tilde H^{\bullet + n}(Th(V);R)
$$

of degree $n$ from the unreduced [[cohomology group]] of $B$ to the [[reduced cohomology]] of the [[Thom space]] of $V$.

+-- {: .proof #ProofOfThomIsomorphismViaFiberwiseThomSpaceFibration}
###### Proof 
**(of Thom isomorphism via fiberwise Thom spaces)**


Choose an [[orthogonal structure]] on $V$. Consider the _fiberwise_ [[cofiber]] 

$$
  E \coloneqq D(V)/_B S(V)
$$

of the inclusion of the unit sphere bundle into the unit disk bundle of $V$ ([def.](Thom+space#ThomSpace)).

$$
  \array{
    S^{n-1} &\hookrightarrow& D^n &\longrightarrow& S^n
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    S(V) &\hookrightarrow& D(V) &\longrightarrow& E
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    B &=& B &=& B
  }
$$

Observe that this has the following properties

1. $E \overset{p}{\to} B$ is an [[n-sphere]] [[fiber bundle]], hence in particular a [[Serre fibration]];

1. the [[Thom space]] $Th(V)\simeq E/B$ is the quotient of $E$ by the base space, because of the [[pasting law]] applied to the following pasting diagram of [[pushout]] squares

   $$
     \array{ 
       S(V) &\longrightarrow& D(V)
       \\
       \downarrow &(po)& \downarrow
       \\
       B &\longrightarrow& D(V)/_B S(V)
       \\
       \downarrow &(po)& \downarrow
       \\
       \ast &\longrightarrow& Th(V)
     }
   $$

1. hence the [[reduced cohomology]] of the Thom space is ([def.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+S#ReducedToUnreducedGeneralizedCohomology)) the [[relative cohomology]] of $E$ relative $B$

   $$
     \tilde H^\bullet(Th(V);R) \simeq H^\bullet(E,B;R)
     \,.
   $$

1. $E \overset{p}{\to} B$ has a global [[section]] $B \overset{s}{\to} E$ (given over any point $b \in B$ by the class of any point in the fiber of $S(V) \to B$ over $b$; or abstractly: induced via the above pushout by the commutation of the projections from $D(V)$ and from $S(V)$, respectively).


In the following we write $H^\bullet(-)\coloneqq H^\bullet(-;R)$, for short.

By the first point, there is the [[Thom-Gysin sequence]], an [[exact sequence]] running vertically in the following diagram

$$
  \array{
    && H^\bullet(B)
    \\
    && {}^{\mathllap{p^\ast}}\downarrow  & \searrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    \\
    \tilde H^\bullet(Th(V))
      &\longrightarrow&
    H^\bullet(E)
      &\underset{s^\ast}{\longrightarrow}&
    H^\bullet(B)
    \\
    && \downarrow
    \\
    && H^{\bullet-n}(B)
  }
  \,.
$$ 

By the second point above this is [[split exact sequence|split]], as shown by the diagonal isomorphism in the top right. By the third point above there is the horizontal exact sequence, as shown, which is the [exact sequence in relative cohomology](generalized+%28Eilenberg-Steenrod%29+cohomology#ExactnessUnreduced) $\cdots \to H^\bullet(E,B) \to H^\bullet(E) \to H^\bullet(B) \to \cdots$ induced from the section $B \hookrightarrow E$.

Hence using the splitting to decompose the term in the middle as a [[direct sum]], and then using horizontal and vertical exactness at that term yields

$$
  \array{
    && H^\bullet(B)
    \\
    && {}^{\mathllap{(0,id)}}\downarrow  & \searrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    \\
    \tilde H^\bullet(Th(V))
      &\overset{(id,0)}{\hookrightarrow}&
    \tilde H^\bullet(Th(V))
      \oplus 
    H^\bullet(B)
      &\underset{(0,id)}{\longrightarrow}&
    H^\bullet(B)
    \\
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(id,0)}}
    \\
    && H^{\bullet-n}(B)
  }
$$ 

and hence an isomorphism

$$
  \tilde H^\bullet(Th(V))
    \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  H^{\bullet-n}(B)
  \,.
$$

To see that this is the inverse of a morphism of the form $c \cup (-)$, inspect the [proof of the Gysin sequence](Thom-Gysin+sequence#ProofOfThomGysinSequence). This shows that $H^{\bullet-n}(B)$ here is identified with elements that on the second page of the corresponding [[Serre spectral sequence]] are cup products 

$$
  \iota \cup b
$$ 

with $\iota$ fiberwise the canonical class $1 \in H^n(S^n)$ and with $b \in H^\bullet(B)$ any element. Since $H^\bullet(-;R)$ is a [[multiplicative cohomology theory]] (because the [[coefficients]] form a [[ring]] $R$), cup producs are preserved as one passes to the $E_\infty$-page of the spectral sequence, and the morphism $H^\bullet(E) \to B^\bullet(B)$ above, hence also the isomorphism $\tilde H^\bullet(Th(V)) \to H^\bullet(B)$, factors through the $E_\infty$-page (see towards the end of the [proof of the Gysin sequence](Thom-Gysin+sequence#ProofOfThomGysinSequence)). Hence the image of $\iota$ on the $E_\infty$-page is the Thom class in question.

#### In generalized cohomology

Let $E$ be a [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] theory. First observe that an [[E-orientation]] on $V \to X$ induces an $H \pi_0(E)$-orientation, i.e. in [[ordinary cohomology]] with coefficients in the degree-0 ground ring.

To see this, let's assume $E$ is [[connective spectrum|connective]]. Coonsider the [[relative Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence]]

$$
  \tilde H^p(Th(V), E^q(\ast))
  \simeq
  H^p(D(V),S(V), E^q(\ast))
    \;\Rightarrow\;
  E^\bullet(D(V), S(V))
  \simeq
  \tilde E^\bullet(Th(V))
$$

Since $(D(V), S(V))$ is $(n-1)$-connected for a rank $n$ vector bundle, then $E_2^{p \lt n, q} = 0$. Hence the edge homomorphism

$$
  \tilde H^k(Th(V), E^0(\ast)) \longrightarrow \tilde H^0(Th(V))
$$

is an [[isomorphism]], and one checks that it sends Thom classes to Thom classes.
