## Definition

A a _homotopy class_ is an [[equivalence class]] under [[homotopy]]:


For $f \;\colon\; X \to Y$ a [[continuous function]] between [[topological spaces]] which admit the structure of [[CW-complexes]], its _homotopy class_ is the [[morphism]] in the [[classical homotopy category]] that is represented by $f$. The sets of such homotopy classes if often denoted $[X,Y]$ or similar.

Similarly, if $f$ is a base-point preserving function between [[pointed topological spaces]] admitting the structure of [[CW-complexes]], then its homotopy class ("pointed homomotopy class") represents a morphism in the [[homotopy category]] of [[pointed homotopy types]]. The sets of such pointed homotopy classes if often denoted $[X,Y]_\ast$ or similar.

## Examples

### Homotopy groups and Cohomotopy sets

If the [[domain]] $X \simeq S^n$ is an [[n-sphere]], then the homotopy classes of maps $f \colon S^n \to X$ form the $n$th *[[homotopy group]]* of $Y$.

If the [[codomain]] is an [[n-sphere]] $Y \simeq S^n$, then the homotopy classes of maps $f \colon X \to S^n$ form the [[Cohomotopy set]] of $X$.
