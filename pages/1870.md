## Idea 

_Twisted K-theory_ is a [[twisted cohomology]] version of ([[topological K-theory|topological]]) [[K-theory]]. 

The most famous twist is by a class in degree 3 [[ordinary cohomology]] (geometrically a $U(1)$-[[bundle gerbe]] or [[circle 2-group]]-[[principal 2-bundle]]), but there are various other twists. 

## Definition 

### By sections of associated $K U$-bundles


Write $K U$ for the [[spectrum]] of complex [[topological K-theory]]. Its degree-0 space is, up to [[weak homotopy equivalence]],  the space 

$$
  B U \times \mathbb{Z} = {\lim_\to}_n B U(n) \times \mathbb{Z}
$$

or the space $Fred(\mathcal{H})$ of  [[Fredholm operator]]s on some separable [[Hilbert space]] $\mathcal{H}$.

$$
  (K U)_0 \simeq B U \times \mathbb{Z} \simeq Fred(\mathcal{H})
  \,.
$$

The ordinary [[topological K-theory]] of a [[topological space]] $X$ is

$$
  K(X)_\bullet \simeq [X, (K U)_\bullet]
  \,.
$$

The [[projective unitary group]] $P U(\mathcal{H})$ (a [[topological group]]) acts canonically by [[automorphism]]s on $(K U)_0$. Therefore for $P \to X$ any $PU(\mathcal{H})$-[[principal bundle]], we can form the [[associated bundle]] $P \times_{P U(\mathcal{H})} (K U)_0$.

Since the [[homotopy type]] of $P U(\mathcal{H})$ is that of an [[Eilenberg-MacLane space]] $K(\mathbb{Z},2)$, there is precisely one isomorphism class of such bundles representing a class $\alpha \in H^3(X, \mathbb{Z})$.

+-- {: .num_defn #SpectrumBundDefinition}
###### Definition

The **twisted K-theory** with twist $\alpha \in H^3(X, \mathbb{Z})$ is the set of [[homotopy]]-classes of [[section]]s of such a bundle

$$
  K_\alpha(X)^0
  :=
  \Gamma_X(P^\alpha \times_{P U(\mathcal{H})} (K U)_0)
  \,.
$$

Similarily the reduced $\alpha$-twisted K-theory is the subset

$$
  \tilde K_\alpha(X)^0
  :=
  \Gamma_X(P^\alpha \times_{P U(\mathcal{H})} B U)
  \,.
$$

### By bundles of Fredholm operators

The following is due to ([Atiyah-Singer 69](#AtiyahSinger69), [Atiyah-Segal 04](#AtiyahSegal04)).

Write

* $Cl_n \coloneqq Cl^{\mathbb{C}}(\mathbb{R}^n,\langle -,-\rangle)$

  for the [[complexification]] of the [[Clifford algebra]] of the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ with its standard [[inner product]];

* $S_n$ for its $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$-[[graded module|graded]] [[irreducible module]] (see at _[[spin representation]]_);

* $H_0$ for [[generalized the|the]] $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$-graded [[separable Hilbert space]] whose even and odd part are both infinite-dimensional.

+-- {: .num_defn #Fredn}
###### Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the [[topological space]] $Fred^{(n)}$ of [[Fredholm operators]] on $S_n \otimes H_0$ is the [[set]]

$$
  Fred^{(n)}
  \coloneqq
  \left\{
    F \in \mathcal{B}(S_n \otimes H_0)
    \;|\;
    F \, odd\,,
    F^\ast = F \,,
    F^2 - 1 \in \mathcal{K}(S_n \otimes H_0)\,,
    [F,\gamma] = 0 \, for\, \gamma \in Cl_n
  \right\}
$$

(where $\mathcal{B}$ denotes [[bounded operators]] and $\mathcal{K}$ denotes [[compact operators]] and where $[-,-]$ denotes the [[graded commutator]]) and the [[topological space|topology]] on this set is the [[subspace topology]] induced by the embedding

$$
  Fred^{(n)}
  \hookrightarrow
  \mathcal{B}(S_n \otimes H_0)
  \times
  \mathcal{K}(S_n \otimes H_0)
$$

given by

$$
  F\mapsto (F, F^2 - 1)
  \,,
$$

where $\mathcal{B}$ is equipped with the [[compact-open topology]] and $\mathcal{K}$ with the [[norm topology]].

These spaces indeed form a model for the [[KU]] [[spectrum]]:

###### Proposition

For all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ there are [[natural equivalence|natural]] [[weak homotopy equivalences]]

$$
  Fred^{(n+1)} \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} \Omega Fred^{(n)}
$$

and 

$$
  Fred^{(n+2)} \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} Fred^{(n)}
$$

between the spaces of graded [[Fredholm operators]] of def. \ref{Fredn} and their [[loop spaces]].

### By twisted vector bundles (gerbe modules)

+-- {: .num_defn #TwBundDefinition}
###### Definition

Let $\alpha \in H^3(X, \mathbb{Z})$ be a class in degree-3 [[integral cohomology]] and let $P \in \mathbf{H}^3(X, \mathbf{B}^2 U(1))$ be any [[cocycle]] representative, which we may think of either as giving a 
[[circle n-bundle with connection|circle 2-bundle]] or a [[bundle gerbe]]. 

Write $TwBund(X, P)$ for the [[groupoid]] of [[twisted bundle]]s on $X$ with twist given by $P$. Then let

$$
  \tilde K_\alpha(X) := TwBund(X,P)
$$

be the set of [[isomorphism]] classes of twisted bundles. Call this the **twisted K-theory** of $X$ with twist $\alpha$.
=--

> (Some technical details need to be added for the non-torsion case.)

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

This definition of twisted $K_0$ is equivalent to that of prop. \ref{SpectrumBundDefinition}.

=--

This is ([CBMMS, prop. 6.4, prop. 7.3](#CBMMS)).

### By KK-theory of twisted convolution algebras

A [[circle 2-group]] [[principal 2-bundle]] is also incarnated as a [[centrally extended Lie groupoid]]. The corresponding [[twisted groupoid convolution algebra]] has as its [[operator K-theory]] the twisted K-theory of the base space (or base-[[stack]]). See at _[[KK-theory]]_ for more on this.

## Other constructions

Let $Vectr$ be the [[stack]] of [[vectorial bundle]]s. (If we just take [[vector bundle]]s we get a notion of twisted K-theory that only allows twists that are finite order elements in their [[cohomology group]]).

There is a canonical morphism

$$
  \rho : \mathbf{B} U(1) \to Vect \hookrightarrow Vectr
$$

coming from the standard [[representation]] of the [[group]] $U(1)$.

Let $\mathbf{B}_{\otimes} Vectr$ be the [[delooping]] of $Vectr$ with respect to the [[tensor product]] [[monoidal category|monoidal structure]] (not the additive structure).

Then we have a [[fibration sequence]]

$$
  Vectr \to {*} \to \mathbf{B}_\otimes Vectr
$$

of [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categories]] (instead of [[infinity-groupoid]]s).

The entire morphism above deloops

$$
  \mathbf{B}\rho : \mathbf{B}^2 U(1) \to \mathbf{B}_\otimes Vect \hookrightarrow \mathbf{B}_{\otimes} Vectr
$$

being the standard representation of the [[2-group]] $\mathbf{B}U(1)$.

From the general nonsense of [[twisted cohomology]] this induces canonically now for every $\mathbf{B}^2 U(1)$-[[cohomology|cocycle]] $c$ (for instance given by a [[bundle gerbe]]) a notion of $c$-twisted $Vectr$-cohomology:

$$
 \array{
   \mathbf{H}^c(X, Vectr)
   &\to&
   {*}
   \\
   \downarrow
   &&
   \downarrow^{\mathbf{B}\rho \circ c}
   \\
   {*} &\to& \mathbf{H}(X,\mathbf{B}_\otimes Vectr)
 }
  \,.
$$

After unwrapping what this means, the result of ([Gomi](#Gomi))
shows that [[concordance]] classes in $\mathbf{H}^c(X,Vectr)$ yield twisted K-theory.

## Twists

By the general discussion of [[twisted cohomology]] the [[moduli space]] for the twists of [[periodic complex K-theory]] $KU$ is the [[Picard ∞-group]] in $KU Mod$. The "geometric" twists among these have as moduli space the non-connected delooping $bgl_1^\ast(KU)$ of the [[∞-group of units]] of $KU$.

A model for this in 4-truncation is given by [[super line 2-bundles]]. For the moment see there for further discussion and further references.
