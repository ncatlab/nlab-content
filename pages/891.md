The **quotient object** $Q$ of a [[congruence]] (an [[internalization|internal]] [[equivalence relation]]) $E$ on an object $X$ in a category $C$ is simply the [[coequalizer]] $Q$ of the induced pair of maps $E \to X$.  If $E$ is additionally the [[kernel pair]] of the map $X \to Q$, then $Q$ is called an **effective quotient** (and $E$ is called an **effective** congruence).

Sometimes the term is used more loosely to mean an arbitrary [[coequalizer]].  It may also refer to a co-[[subobject]] of $X$ (that is, a subobject of $X$ in the [[opposite category]] $C^\op$), without reference to any congruence on $X$.  Note that in a [[regular category]], any [[regular epimorphism]] (i.e. a "regular quotient" in the co-subobject sense) is in fact the quotient (= coequalizer) of its [[kernel pair]].
