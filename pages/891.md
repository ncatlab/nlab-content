## Definition

The **quotient object** $Q$ of a [[congruence]] (an [[internalization|internal]] [[equivalence relation]]) $E$ on an [[object]] $X$ in a [[category]] $C$ is the [[coequalizer]] $Q$ of the induced pair of maps $E \to X$.  

If $E$ is additionally the [[kernel pair]] of the map $X \to Q$, then $Q$ is called an **effective quotient** (and $E$ is called an **effective** congruence, with the map $X \to Q$ being an [[effective epimorphism]]).

Sometimes the term is used more loosely to mean an arbitrary [[coequalizer]].  It may also refer to a co-[[subobject]] of $X$ (that is, a subobject of $X$ in the [[opposite category]] $C^\op$), without reference to any congruence on $X$.  Note that in a [[regular category]], any [[regular epimorphism]] (i.e. a "regular quotient" in the co-subobject sense) is in fact the quotient (= coequalizer) of its [[kernel pair]].

## In higher category theory

These notions have generalizations when $C$ is an [[(∞,1)-category]]:

* an equivalence relation is then a [[groupoid object in an (∞,1)-category]]

* it has an "effective quotient" if it is [[delooping|deloopable]].

For instance an [[action groupoid]] is a quotient of a group action in 2-category theory.

## Examples
