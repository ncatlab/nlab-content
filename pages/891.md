## Definition

The **quotient object** $Q$ of a [[congruence]] (an [[internalization|internal]] [[equivalence relation]]) $E$ on an [[object]] $X$ in a [[category]] $C$ is the [[coequalizer]] $Q$ of the induced pair of maps $E \to X$.  

If $E$ is additionally the [[kernel pair]] of the map $X \to Q$, then $Q$ is called an **effective quotient** (and $E$ is called an **effective** congruence, with the map $X \to Q$ being an [[effective epimorphism]]).

Sometimes the term is used more loosely to mean an arbitrary [[coequalizer]].  It may also refer to a co-[[subobject]] of $X$ (that is, a subobject of $X$ in the [[opposite category]] $C^\op$), without reference to any congruence on $X$.  Note that in a [[regular category]], any [[regular epimorphism]] (i.e. a "regular quotient" in the co-subobject sense) is in fact the quotient (= coequalizer) of its [[kernel pair]] (actually, we can prove this under weaker hypotheses; see below).

## Galois connection between quotients and relations 

As we have said, there are various notions of quotient object. Let us consider the most general one, so that $Quot(X)$ of an object $X$ denotes the poset of co-subobjects of $X$, in other words the [[poset|posetal]] [[reflection]] of the [[preorder]] of epis $X \to Q$ which is a [[full subcategory]] of the [[co-slice category]] $X \downarrow \mathbf{C}$. A *regular quotient* then refers to a regular epi $X \to Q$. 

On the other hand, let $Rel(X)$ be the poset of [[relations]] on $X$, i.e., the 
poset of subobjects of $X \times X$, or in other words the posetal reflection of the preorder of monos $i = \langle e_1, e_2 \rangle: E \rightarrowtail X \times X$ which is a full subcategory of the [[slice category]] $\mathbf{C} \downarrow X \times X$. 

Between $Quot(X)$ and $Rel(X)$ there is a relation $\perp$ where $q \perp \langle e_1, e_2 \rangle$ means exactly $q \circ e_1 = q \circ e_2$. If the coequalizer $coeq(e_1, e_2)$ of the parallel pair $e_1, e_2: E \rightrightarrows X$ exists, then by definition we have $coeq(e_1, e_2) \leq q$ iff $q e_1 = q e_2$. On the other hand, if the [[kernel pair]] $\ker(q)$ of $q$ exists, then by definition we have $q e_1 = q e_2$ iff $\langle e_1, e_2 \rangle \leq \ker(q)$. 

This indicates in a category which admits coequalizers and kernel pairs, we have

###### Proposition 
$coeq: Rel(X) \to Quot(X)$ is [[left adjoint]] to $\ker: Quot(X) \to Rel(X)$.

Or, in other words, that $\ker$ and $coeq$ set up a [[Galois connection]] between $Quot(X)^{op}$ and $Rel(X)$. 

Restricting consideration to kernel pairs only of epis, or coequalizers only of jointly monic pairs, is no real restriction in the presence of epi-mono factorizations:

###### Lemma 
In a category where every morphism $f: A \to B$ has an [[image|epi-mono factorization]] $f = i \circ q$, we have $\ker(f) = \ker(q)$. Similarly, for a pair $f, g: X \rightrightarrows Y$, we have $coeq(f, g) = coeq(e_1, e_2)$ where $\langle f, g \rangle: X \to Y \times Y$ factors as an epi $p: X \to E$ followed by a mono $\langle e_1, e_2 \rangle: E \to Y \times Y$.

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
We prove just the first statement; the second is proven similarly. It suffices to observe that the same class of jointly monic pairs $(e_1, e_2)$ are coequalized by $f$ as by $q$; the kernel pair is by definition the maximum of this class. If $q e_1 = q e_2$, then by applying $i$ to both sides we deduce $f e_1 = f e_2$. If $f e_1 = f e_2$, i.e., if $i q e_1 = i q e_2$, then $q e_1 = q e_2$ by monicity of $i$.

###### Proposition  
Suppose $\mathbf{C}$ is a category with coequalizers and kernel pairs and where every morphism has an epi-mono factorization. Then every regular epi $q$ is the coequalizer of its kernel pair: $q = coeq \circ \ker(q)$. And every kernel pair is the kernel pair of its coequalizer: $i = \ker \circ coeq(i)$.

###### Proof 
We just prove the first statement; the second is proved similarly. We have of course a [[counit]] $coeq \circ \ker(q) \leq q$. On the other hand, if $q = coeq(f, g)$ (where we may assume $\langle f, g \rangle$ is monic by the lemma), then we have a unit $\langle f, g \rangle \leq \ker \circ coeq(f, g) = \ker(q)$; applying $coeq$ to each side, we have $q \leq coeq \circ \ker(q)$, as desired.

## In higher category theory

These notions have generalizations when $C$ is an [[(∞,1)-category]]:

* an equivalence relation is then a [[groupoid object in an (∞,1)-category]]

* it has an "effective quotient" if it is [[delooping|deloopable]].

For instance an [[action groupoid]] is a quotient of a group action in 2-category theory.

* [[quotient group]]

* [[quotient module]]

* [[quotient ring]]
