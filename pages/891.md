The **quotient object** $Q$ of a [[congruence]] (an [[internalization|internal]] [[equivalence relation]]) $E$ on an object $X$ in a category $C$ is simply the [[coequalizer]] $Q$ of the induced pair of maps $E \to X$.  If $E$ is the [[kernel pair]] of the map $X \to Q$, then $Q$ is called an **effective quotient** (and $E$ is called an **effective** congruence).

Sometimes the term is used more loosely to mean an arbitrary [[coequalizer]].  It may also refer to a co-[[subobject]] of $X$ (that is, a subobject of $X$ in the [[opposite category]] $C^\op$), without reference to any congruence on $X$.  Note that in a [[regular category]], any [[regular epimorphism]] (i.e. a "regular quotient" in the co-subobject sense) is in fact the quotient (= coequalizer) of its [[kernel pair]].

[[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: To respond to your earlier, deleted comment, I don't think it's silly to use "quotient" to mean "cosubobject" any more than it's silly to use "epimorphism" to mean "comonomorphism."  I think I would prefer using "a quotient" to mean "a cosubobject" (with meaning varying along the "extremal, strong, regular, etc." axis), but also allowing "quotient of blah" for any coequalizer, not necessarily of an equivalence relation.  Only in a good enough category (like a regular one) does every parallel pair generate an equivalence relation, but I think such coequalizers still merit the name "quotient."

I think the reason I included effective quotients was because I'd noticed several pages saying that an exact category is a regular category where all equivalence relations have quotients, and this is only true if by "quotient" you mean "effective quotient."  However, possibly I should just have changed those pages to say "effective quotient."

_Toby_:  Yeah, did I ever tell you that I thought that I never liked 'epimorphism'?  (Sometimes I want to use 'epimorphism' to mean 'regular epimorphism', but of course there are several more variations.)  But anyway ... why use 'quotient' for 'coequaliser'?  I would really like to say 'This category has all quotients.', although I\'ve always been more explicit in these pages.  In summary: if a word is used in a specific context, use the variety of words in English to distinguish things.

I think that the missing 'effective' in many pages is either from my copying one mistake to a bunch of places or from my making a mistake in copying.  (Because I did copy that to a bunch of relevant pages from one source page once.)  I\'m glad about that one.

[[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: What about this?
