## Idea

What is called _phantom dark energy_ ([Caldwell 02](#Caldwell02)) is [[dark energy]] with an [[equation of state]] with $w \lt 1$, hence with [[stress-energy tensor]] of the form 

$$
  T_{\mu \nu}
  \;=\;
  (\epsilon - P) u_\mu u_\nu - g_{\mu \nu} P
$$

(for $u$ its density/flow [[vector field]] and $P \in \mathbb{R}$ the [[pressure]]) with 

\[
  \label{wSmallerThanMinusOne}
  w \;\coloneqq\; \frac{P}{\epsilon} \;\lt\;
  1
  \,.
\]

It has been argued that data of observational [[cosmology]] actually prefers [[phantom dark energy]] over a plain [[cosmological constant]] (which correspondes to $w = 1$), see e.g. [Caldwell 02](#Caldwell02), [Di Valentino-Melchiorri-Silk 20](#ValentinoMelchiorriSilk20).

## As an effective phenomenon
 {#AsAnEffectivePhenomenon}

Taken at face value a fundamental [[field (physics)]] with such an equation of state with $w \lt 1$ (eq:wSmallerThanMinusOne) appears to be inconsistent, as it violates the [[null energy condition]]. (Though this is subtle in itself, even fields with $w \gt -1$ may violate the [[null energy condition]] [Sawicku-Vikman 12](#SawickuVikman12)).

But apparent phantom dark energy may appear as an effective description of more fundamental effects, for instance of an [[inhomogeneous cosmology]] ([Ludwick 15](#Ludwick15), [Ludwick 18](#Ludwick18), review in [Ludwick 17, Section 6](#Ludwick17))
