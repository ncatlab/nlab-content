
The [[conjecture|conjectured]] _[[duality in string theory|duality]]_ between [[type IIA string theory]] and the theory with working title _[[M-theory]]_ is essentially one half of what defines [[M-theory]] in the first place, namely the statement that it is the [[non-perturbative effect|non-perturbative]] theory of which the [[string perturbation series]] of [[type IIA string theory]] is the perturbation series of.

The second defining characteristic of [[M-theory]] is that at low [[energy]], hence large [[wavelength]], it is approximated by [[11-dimensional supergravity]], while the low energy limit of [[type IIA string theory]] is [[10d type IIA supergravity]].

In view of this, the conjectured relation betweem M-theory and [[type IIA string theory]] says, more in detail, that in the low energy limit it becomes the relation exhibited by the [[Kaluza-Klein compactification]] of [[11-dimensional supergravity]] to [[10d type IIA supergravity]] on a [[circle fiber]], such that the [[radius]] of the circle fiber is proportional to the [[coupling constant]] of type II A string theory.
