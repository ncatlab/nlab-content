# The epistemic logics $S4$ and $S4_{(m)}$

## Idea

The flavor of _[[modal logic]]_ called $S4$ is [[propositional logic]] equipped with a single [[modality]] usually written "$\Box$" subject to the rules that for all [[propositions]] $p, q \colon Prop$ we have

1. $\Box K \colon \Box(p \to q) \to (\Box p \to \Box q)$ ([[K modal logic]])

1. $\Box T \colon \Box p \to p$ ([[T modal logic]])

1. $\Box 4 \colon \Box p \to \Box \Box p$. (S4 modal logic)

Traditionally the canonical interpretation of the Box operator is that $\Box p$ is the statement that "$p$ is _necessarily_ true." (The [[de Morgan duality|de Morgan dual]] to the necessity modality is the "possibility" modality.) Then the interpretation of $\Box $ is that "If $p$ is necessarily true then it is necessarily necessarily true."
S4 modal logic appears in many [[temporal logics]].


If instead of a single Box operator one considers $n \in \mathbb{N}$ box operators $\Box_i$ of this form the resulting modal logic is denote $S4(n)$. Here $\Box_i p$ is sometimes interpreted as "the $i$th agent knows $p$."

## Properties

### Relation to Kripke frames

The [[models]] for [[T modal logic]] corresponded to [[Kripke frames]] where each [[relation]] $R_i$ is [[reflexive relation|reflexive]].  
For $S4$ modal logic they are furthermore [[transitive relation|transitive]].

###### Theorem (Soundness of $S4_{(m)}$)

$S4_{(m)}\vdash \phi \Rightarrow \mathcal{S}4(m)\models \phi.$

###### Proof

(We show this for $m = 1$.)

Suppose that $\mathfrak{M}= ((W,R),V)$ where $R$ is a reflexive transitive relation on $W$.  We have to check that $\mathfrak{M}\models (4)$.

Suppose $\mathfrak{M},w\models K p$, then, for every  $t$ with $R w t$, we have $\mathfrak{M},t\models p$.  Now suppose we seek to check that $\mathfrak{M},w\models K K p$ so we have $t$ with $R w t$ and want $\mathfrak{M},t\models K p$, so we look at all $u$ with $R t u$ and have to see if $\mathfrak{M},u\models p$, but as $R w t$ and $R t u$ hold then $R w u$ holds, since $R$ is transitive, and we then _know_ that $\mathfrak{M},u\models p$.
