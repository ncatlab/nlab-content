## Idea

An _exotic smooth structure_ is, roughly speaking, a [[smooth structure]] on a [[topological manifold]] $X$ which makes the resulting [[smooth manifold]] be [[diffeomorphism|non-diffeomorphic]] to the smooth manifold given by some evident 'standard' smooth structure on $X$. 

Milnor (1956) gave the first examples of exotic smooth structures on the 7-[[sphere]], finding at least seven. Note that spheres inherit a canonical smooth structure from their canonical (topological) embedding into a [[Cartesian space]] $S^n \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$.

Via the celebrated h cobordism theorem of Smale (Smale 1962, Milnor 1965) one gets a relation between the number of smooth structures on the $n$-sphere $S^n$ (for $n \geq 5$) and the number of isotopy classes $\pi_0 (Diff(S^{n-1}))$ of the equator $S^{n-1}$. Then Kervaire and Milnor (1963) proved that there are only finitely many exotic smooth structures on all spheres in dimension 5 or higher. A complete classification for manifolds in dimension 5 and higher was established by Kirby and Siebenman (1977) using obstruction theory.

Note that there exist uncountably many exotic smooth structures on $\mathbb{R}^4$ (Gompf 1985, Freedman/Taylor 1986, Taubes 1987), but a unique smooth structure on $\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n\neq 4$ (Stallings, Zeeman 1962). There is a unique maximal exotic $\mathbb{R}^4$ into which all other 'versions' of $\mathbb{R}^4$ smoothly embed as open subsets (DeMichelis, Freedman 1992).

There are two classes of exotic $\mathbb{R}^4$'s: large and small. A large exotic $\mathbb{R}^4$ cannot be embedded in the 4-sphere $S^4$ whereas a small exotic $\mathbb{R}^4$ admits such an embedding. A large exotic $\mathbb{R}^4$ is constructed by using the failure to smoothly split a smooth 4-manifold (the K3 surface for instance) as connected sum of some factors (where a topological splitting exits). The small exotic $\mathbb{R}^4$ (or ribbon $\mathbb{R}^4$) is constructed by using the failure of the smooth h cobordism theorem in dimension 4 (Donaldson 1987, 1990). Bizaca and Gompf (1996) are able to present an infinte handly body of a small exotic $\mathbb{R}^4$ which serve as a coordinate representation.

Moise (1952) proved that in dimension 3 there are no exotic differentiable structures, or to put in another way, 3-dimensional differentiable manifolds which are [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] are [[diffeomorphism|diffeomorphic]]. In this way the 3-sphere $S^3$ inherits a unique differentiable structure, no matter which $\mathbb{R}^4$ it is considered to be embedded in.

Rado (1925) proved that in dimension 2 there are no exotic differentiable structures (or the uniqueness of the standard structure). The classification of 1-dimensional manifolds and the uniqueness of the smooth structure can be found in the Appendix of Milnor (1965b).

### In applications to physics

A survey of the application to [[physics]] is in 

* [[Torsten Asselmeyer-Maluga]], [[Carl Brans]], _Exotic smoothness and physics. Differential topology and spacetime models_ Singapore: World Scientific (2007) ([ZMATH](http://www.zentralblatt-math.org/zmath/en/advanced/?q=an:1177.83001&format=complete))


#### General relativity

Brans was the first who considered exotic $4$-manifolds from the [[general relativity]] point of view:

* [[Carl Brans]], [[Duane Randall]] _Exotic differentiable structures and general relativity_ Gen. Rel. Grav., 25 (1993) 205--220

* [[Carl Brans]] _Exotic smoothness and physics_ J. Math. Phys. 35, (1994), 5494--5506.

The following paper contained a first proof to localize exotic smoothness in an exotic $\mathbb{R}^4$:

* [[Carl Brans]] _Localized exotic smoothness_ Class. Quant. Grav., 11, (1994), 1785--1792.

A more philosohphical discussion can be found in:

* [[Carl Brans]] _Absolulte spacetime: the twentieth century ether_ Gen. Rel. Grav. 31, (1999),  597--609



#### Generation of source terms (fields)

Brans conjectured in the papers above, that exotic smoothness should be a source of an additional [[gravity|gravitational field]] (Brans conjecture). This conjecture was confirmed for compact $4$-manifolds (using implicitly a mapping of basic classes):

* [[Torsten Asselmeyer]] _Generation of source terms in general relativity by differential structures_ Class. Quant. Grav. 14, (1996), 749--758

Using the invariant of L. Taylor [arXiv](http://de.arxiv.org/abs/math/9807143), Sladkowski confirmed the conjecture for the exotic $\mathbb{R}^4$ in:

* [[Jan Sładkowski]] _Gravity on exotic R4 with few symmetries_ Int.J. Mod. Phys. D, 10, (2001) 311--313

Via a detailed analysis of the Casson handle (as the main object to construct exotic smoothness for $4$-manifolds via the Akbulut cork), it is possible to get the action of Dirac field and of the gauge bosons from the [[Einstein-Hilbert action]] (witha boundary term) in:

* [[Torsten Asselmeyer-Maluga]], [[Helge Rose']] _On the geometrization of matter by exotic smoothness_, [arXiv:1006.2230](http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.2230)



#### Gerbes, WZW models, foliations

The first paper describes a construction of an exotic $\mathbb{R}^4$ via a codimension-$1$ foliation of a homology $3$-sphere in the interior (classified by the Godbillon--Vey invariant). One of the results is a charge quantization without a monopole:

* [[Torsten Asselmeyer-Maluga]], [[Jerzy Król]] _Gerbes, SU(2) WZW models and exotic smooth $\mathbb{R}^4$_ [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.1276)

Then one gets various relations to [[orbifold]]s and the [[WZW model]] (level of the conformal field theory)

and the whole work of Seiberg and Witten leading to the celebrated invariants.

Using the relation to foliations and [[noncommutative geometry]] for the leave space, one can reproduce the vacuum sector of a QFT (the [[von Neumann algebra factor|factor]] $III_1$) via exotic smoothness as explained here:
