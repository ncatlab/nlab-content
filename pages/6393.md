## Idea

The _spinning string_ is a variant of the [[string]] in direct analogy (but one [[worldvolume]] [[dimension]] higher) to how the [[spinning particle]] is a variant of the [[particle]].

(Which means that "spinning" here is _not_ in the sense of "rotating", but in the sense of the kind of "intrinsic" spin as exhibited by [[fermion]] [[particle]]s. A spinning string can rotate _in addition_ to its intrinsic spin.)

And just as as the [[spinning particle]] automatically exhibits local [[worldline supersymmetry]], the spinning string automatically exhibits local [[worldsheet]] [[supersymmetry]]. For that reason it is today almost exclusively known as the _[[superstring]]_ . 

In fact, the very notion of [[supersymmetry]] was realized (in parallel to its independent discovery in Russia) when people noticed that the spinning string [[sigma-model]] -- also called the _Neveu-Ramond-Schwarz model_ (**NSR model**) -- automatically exhibits this extra graded symmetry.

When supplemented with an operation called the _[[GSO projection]]_, the [[second quantization]] of the spinning string -- its effective [[target space|target]] [[spacetime]] theory -- also becomes a locally supersymmetric theory: [[spacetime]] [[supergravity]].

There are other formulations of the [[superstring]] which are thought to be equivalent in some sense. Notably the [[Green-Schwarz superstring]] is a sigma-model which is not supersymmetric on the [[worldsheet]] but instead takes values in a genuine [[spacetime]] [[supermanifold]].
