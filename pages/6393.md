## Idea

The _spinning string_ is a variant of the [[string]] in direct analogy (but one [[worldvolume]] [[dimension]] higher) to how the [[spinning particle]] is a variant of the [[particle]].

And just as as the [[spinning particle]] automatically exhibits local [[worldline supersymmetry]], the spinning string automatically exhibits local [[worldsheet]] [[supersymmetry]]. For that reason it is today almost exclusively known as the _[[superstring]]_ . 

In fact, the very notion of [[supersymmetry]] was realized (in parallel to its independent discovery in Russia) when people noticed that the spinning string [[sigma-model]] -- also called the _Neveu-Ramond-Schwarz model_ (NSR model) -- automatically exhibits this extra graded symmetry.
