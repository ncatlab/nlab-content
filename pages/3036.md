## Definitions

A [[topological space]] is __separable__ if it has a [[countable set|countable]] [[dense subspace|dense]] subset.

To be explicit, $X$ is __separable__ if there exists an [[infinite sequence]] $a\colon \mathbb{N} \to X$ such that, given any point $b$ in $X$ and any [[neighbourhood]] $U$ of $b$, we have $a_i \in U$ for some $i$.


## Properties

A [[second-countable space]] is separable and 
[[first-countable space|first-countable]], but the converse need not
(see Steen Seebach Example 51 ).

Many results in [[analysis]] are easiest for separable spaces.  This is particularly true if one wishes to avoid using strong forms of the [[axiom of choice]] or to be [[predicative mathematics|predicative]] over the natural numbers.

###### Theorem 
A [[metric space]] $X$ is separable iff every open set is a countable union of balls.

###### Proof 
One direction is easy: if $x_i$ is a countable dense subset of $X$ and $r_j$ is an enumeration of the rationals, then the balls $B_{r_j}(x_i)$ is a countable base ($X$ is a [[second-countable space]]), and in particular every open set is a union of a family of such balls that is at most countable. 

The other direction is trickier. (This is based on a [MathOverflow discussion](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/181226/if-any-open-set-is-a-countable-union-of-balls-does-it-imply-separability), which for the moment we record with little adaptation.) Suppose $X$ is not separable; construct by recursion a sequence $x_\beta$ of length $\omega_1$ such that no $x_\beta$ lies in the closure of the set of its predecessors $x_\alpha$ (each such set is countable and therefore not dense, so such $x_\beta$ outside its closure can be found at each stage). 

Therefore, for each $x_\beta$ we may choose a rational radius $r_\beta$ such that the ball $B_{r_\beta}(x_\beta)$ contains no predecessor $x_\alpha$. There are uncountably many $\beta$, so some rational radius $r$ was used uncountably many times. The collection of $x_\beta$ for which $r_\beta = r$ forms another $\omega_1$-sequence which we now use instead of the first; since all the radii are the same, this sequence has the property that each $B_r(x_\beta)$ contains no other $x_\alpha$, no matter whether $\alpha$ appears before or after $\beta$ in the sequence. 

Provided that there uncountably many such $x_\alpha$ that are non-isolated in $X$, we can easily construct an open set $U$ that is not a countable union of balls. For around each such $x_\alpha$ we can find a small ball $B_{s_\alpha}(x_\alpha)$ of radius at most $r/2$, such that $B_r(x_\alpha) \backslash B_{s_\alpha}(x_\alpha)$ is inhabited by a point $p_\alpha$. Put $U = \bigcup_\alpha B_{s_\alpha}(x_\alpha)$. No ball $B_s(x_\alpha)$ interior to $U$ can contain another $x_\beta$, since for that we would need $s \gt r$ and such $B_s(x_\alpha)$ would then include $p_\alpha$, which is excluded from $U$ by design. Thus, since there are uncountably many $x_\beta$, we need uncountably many balls to cover $U$. 

We may therefore assume that there are at most countably many non-isolated $x_\beta$. Discard these, so without loss of generality we may suppose all the $x_\beta$ are isolated points of $X$ and that for some fixed $r$ the ball $B_r(x_\beta)$ contains no other $x_\alpha$. For each $\beta$, let $t_\beta$ be the supremum over all $t$ such that $B_t(x_\beta)$ is countable. It follows that $B_{t_\beta}(x_\beta)$ is itself countable, as is $\{\alpha: \alpha \lt \beta\}$. At each stage $\beta$, there is a countable set $C_\beta$ disjoint from $B_{t_\beta}(x_\beta) \cup \{\alpha: \alpha \lt \beta\}$ such that for each $s \gt t_\beta$, there exists $y \in C_\beta$ with $d(x_\beta, y) \lt s$. By transfinite induction, we can construct a cofinal subset $I$ of $\omega_1$ such that $x_\beta \notin C_\alpha$ whenever $\alpha \lt \beta$. The set $Y = \{x_\alpha: \alpha \in I\}$ is open in $X$, and we claim that it is not a countable union of balls. For suppose otherwise. Let $F$ be such a countable family of balls; then there is some minimal $\alpha$ for which $B_t(x_\alpha) \in F$ is uncountable, so that $t \gt t_\alpha$. By construction of $C_\alpha$, there exists $y \in C_\alpha \cap B_t(x_\alpha)$. But since $Y = \bigcup F$, we have that $y = x_\beta$ for some $\beta \in I$, and this contradicts our condition on $I$.
