## Idea

There exists a [[model category]] structure on a [[category]] of [[dg-coalgebra]]s whose fibrant objects are precisely [[L-∞ algebra]]s.

###### Definition

Write 

$$
  InfThPoint \hookrightarrow Alg^{op}
$$

for the category of [[infinitesimally thickened points]], the [[full subcategory]] of the [[opposite category]] of 
[[Artin algebras]] ("Weil alebras" in the language of [[synthetic differential geometry]]). The category of _[[infinitesimally thickened points]]_.

Write

$$
  cInfThPoint \hookrightarrow sAlg^{op} \simeq (Alg^{op})^{\Delta}
$$

for the [[full subcategory]] of the [[opposite category]] on [[simplicial algebras]] on those which are [[Artin algebra|Artinian]] (or "Weil" ): the category of [[cosimplicial object|cosimplicial]] [[infinitesimally thickened points]].

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We need to show that the [[pullback]] of a weak equivalence $w$ along a fibration $f$ is again a weak equivalence. If $w$ is a fibration, this is automatic, so by factorisation we reduce to the case where $w$ is a cofibration. Now, every trivial cofibration is $Spf$ of a composition of acyclic small extensions, so we may take $w$ to be $Spf$ of an acyclic small extension $A \to B$ with [[kernel]] $I$. Then $f$ is $Spf$ of a quasi-free map $A \to R$, so the pullback is $Spf$ of $R \to R/IR$, and $IR =I\hat{\otimes}_A R$, so $R \to R/IR$ is also an acyclic small extension.
