## Idea

There exists a [[model category]] structure on a [[category]] of [[dg-coalgebra]]s whose fibrant objects are precisely [[L-∞ algebra]]s.

## Definitions and Quillen equivalences

By definition [[L-∞ algebras]] are the [[∞-algebras]] in the [[category of chain complexes]] over the [[Lie operad]]. As such they carry a [[model structure on algebras over an operad]]. There is a strictification which leads equivalently to a [[model structure on dg-Lie algebras]].

One succinct way to present [[L-∞ algebras]] (as discussed there) is as [[dg-coalgebras]]:

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

An [[L-∞ algebra]] $(\mathfrak{g}, [-], [-,-], [-,-,-], \cdots)$ structure on a [[graded vector space]] $\mathfrak{g}$ is equivalently a [[dg-coalgebra]] structure on the graded-commutative [[cofree coalgebra]] over $\mathfrak{g}$.

Conversely, the [[category]] of [[L-∞ algebras]] (and general "weak" morphisms between them) is the [[full subcategory]] of that of counital cocommutative [[dg-coalgebras]] on those whose underlying bare graded-commutative [[coalgebra]] (forgetting the codifferential) is free

$$
  L_\infty Alg \hookrightarrow dgCoCAlk
  \,.
$$

=--

Accordingly it is of interest to have a also [[model structure on dg-coalgebras]] which presents $L_\infty$-algebras.


### On dg-Lie algebras

Let $k$ be a [[field]] of [[characteristic]] 0.

###### Definition

Write $dgLie_k \in Cat$ for the [[category]] of [[dg-Lie algebras]]
over $k$.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #ModelStructureOnDgLieAlgebras}
###### Proposition

The category $dgLie_k$ carries a 
[[cofibrantly generated model category|cofibrantly generated]] 
[[model category]] structure in which

* [[fibrations]] are the degreewise [[surjective maps]];

* [[weak equivalences]] are the [[quasi-isomorphisms]]

on the underlying [[chain complexes]]. This is the 
[[transferred model structure]] of the corresponding 
[[model structure on chain complexes]] along the [[forgetful functor]]
to the [[category of chain complexes]].

We call this the **[[model structure on dg-Lie algebras]]**.

###### Definition

Write 

$$
  \mathcal{C} \;\colon\;  dgLie_k \to dgCoCAlg_k
$$

for the [[functor]] which sends a [[dg-Lie algebra]] $(\mathfrak{g},d,[-,-])$ to the [[dg-coalgebra]] whose underlying [[coalgebra]] is free on the underlying [[graded vector space]] $\mathfrak{g}$ and whose [[coderivation]] is given by

$$
  \delta \colon v_1 \mapsto d v_1
$$

$$  
  \delta \colon (v_1, v_2) \mapsto [v_1, v_2]
$$

and then extended as a coderivation.

The functor from def. \ref{SendingDGLieAlgebraToDgCoalgebra} has 
a [[left adjoint]]

###### Remark

If one thinks of a [[dg-coalgebra]] as presenting a
a derived formal space, as discuss [below](#SheavesOverCosimplicialInfinitesimallyThickenedPoints)
then its image under $\mathcal{L}$, prop. \ref{LeftAdjointFromDgCoAlgToDgAlg}, 
may be thought of as its
_tangen dg-Lie algebra_. Therefore $\mathcal{L}$
is also called the **tangent Lie algebra functor**.

###### Proposition

There exists a [[model category]] structure on $dgCoCAlg_k$
for which

* the [[cofibrations]] are the morphisms that are degreewise [[injections]];

* the [[weak equivalences]] are the morphisms $f$ whose corresponding morphisms of [[dg-Lie algebras]] $\mathcal{L}(f)$, prop. \ref{LeftAdjointFromDgCoAlgToDgAlg}, is a [[quasi-isomorphism]] on the underlying [[chain complexes]].

###### Proposition

The pair of [[adjoint functors]]

$$
  (\mathcal{L} \dashv \mathcal{C})
  \;\colon\;
  dgLie_k
   \stackrel{\overset{\mathcal{L}}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\mathcal{C}}{\to}}
  dgCoCAlg_k
$$

from prop. \ref{LeftAdjointFromDgCoAlgToDgAlg} constitutes a [[Quillen equivalence]] between the [[model structure on dg-Lie algebras]], prop. \ref{ModelStructureOnDgLieAlgebras}, and the [[model structure on dg-coalgebras]], prop. \ref{ModelStructureOnCocommutativeDGCoalgebras}.

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Since every object in $dgCoCAlg_k$ is a [[cofibrant object]] and every object in $dgLie_k$ is a [[fibrant object]], the composite

$$
  \mathcal{C}\mathcal{L}
  \colon
  dgCoCAlg_k
  \to 
  dgCocAlg_k
$$

is already its [[derived functor]] and the [[unit of an adjunction|unit]]

$$
  \mathfrak{g} \to \mathcal{C}\mathcal{L}\mathfrak{g}
$$

is a [[weak equivalence]] that exhibits $\mathcal{C}\mathcal{L}\mathfrak{g}$ as a [[fibrant resolution]] and moreover, if $\mathfrak{g}$ was already fibrant, hence by prop. \ref{spring} an [[L-∞ algebra]], as a **strictification** of $\mathfrak{g}$, by remark \ref{spring}.

This observation has been communicated privatly by [[Jonathan Pridham]]

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We need to show that the [[pullback]] of a weak equivalence $w$ along a fibration $f$ is again a weak equivalence. If $w$ is a fibration, this is automatic, so by factorisation we reduce to the case where $w$ is a cofibration. Now, every trivial cofibration is $Spf$ of a composition of acyclic small extensions, so we may take $w$ to be $Spf$ of an acyclic small extension $A \to B$ with [[kernel]] $I$. Then $f$ is $Spf$ of a quasi-free map $A \to R$, so the pullback is $Spf$ of $R \to R/IR$, and $IR =I\hat{\otimes}_A R$, so $R \to R/IR$ is also an acyclic small extension.
