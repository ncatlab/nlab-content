##The spectral sequence##

We would like to understand the following theorem.

**Theorem.** Let $( X, \mathbf{O})$ be a derived Deligne-Mumford stack.  Then there is a spectral sequence
$$H^s (X ; \pi_t \mathbf{O}) \Rightarrow \pi_{t-s} \Gamma (X , \mathbf{O}).$$

###Recalling what is what###
Let $X$ be an $\infty$-topos, heuristically $X$ is ''sheaves of spaces on an $\infty$-category $C$.''  Further $\mathbf{O}$ is a functor $\mathbf{O} : \{ E_\infty \}^{op} \to X$, which for a cover $U$ of $C$ formally assigns
$$A \mapsto (U \mapsto \mathrm{Hom} (A , \mathbf{O} (U))).$$
Via DAG V 2.2.1 we can make sense of global sections and $\Gamma (X , \mathbf{O})$ is an $E_\infty$-ring.

Given an $\infty$-category $C$ we can form the subcategory of $n$ _truncated objects_ $\tau_{\le n} C$ which consists of all objects such that all mapping spaces have trivial homotopy groups above level $n$. Further $\tau_{\le n} : C \to C$ defines a functor which serves the role of the Postnikov decomposition.

Let $X$ be an $\infty$-topos, define $\mathrm{Disc} \; X : = \tau_{\le 0} X$.  Further define functors $\pi_n : X_* \to N (\mathrm{Disc} \; X)$ by
$$Y \mapsto \tau_{\le 0} \mathrm{Map} (S^n , Y) = \pi_n (Y) .$$

**Facts.**

1. For $A \in \mathrm{Disc} \; X$ an abelian group object there exists $K(A,n) \in X$, such that
$$ H^n (X, A) := \pi_0 \mathrm{Map} (1_X , K(A,n)) $$
corresponds to sections of $K(A,n)$ along the identity of $C$.

1. If $C$ is an ordinary site, $H^n (X, A)$ corresponds to ordinary sheaf cohomology (HTT 7.2.2.17).
