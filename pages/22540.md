## Idea

In [[solid state physics]] and [[quantum many-body physics]], and specifically in the context of [[topological phases of matter]],
by a *[[Majorana dimer]]* one means a [[dimer]] $a \to b$ (an [[edge]] in some [[graph]])  that is labeled by an [[entangled state]] $\psi_{a b}$ of two [[qbits]] ("spins") characterized by the equation

$$
  \big( 
    \gamma_a + i p_{a b} \gamma_b
  \big) 
  \left\vert \psi \right\rangle
  \;=\;
  0
  \,,
$$

where 

* $\gamma_i = f^\dagger_i + f_i$ are [[Clifford algebra]] [[operators]] defined in terms of the [[canonical anti-commutation relations]] $\{f_j, f^\dagger_j\} = \delta_{i j}$ that define [[qbit]] [[spaces of quantum states]] $\simeq \mathbb{C}^2$ at each of any given lattice sites $i,j, \cdots$, 

* $p_{a b} \in \{\pm 1\}$ is a sign (a direction/orientation of the dimer)

(e.g. [JGPE 19, III.A](#JGPE19))
