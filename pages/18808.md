## Idea

In [[chemistry]] a type of [[atom]] is called a _chemical element_. The [[bound states]] of these are the [[molecules]].

The [[periodic table of the elements]] organizes them according to their [[phenomenology]]. This behaviour is explained by the [[quantum physics]] of [[atoms]]. This transition area between [[quantum physics]] and [[chemistry]] is called [[quantum chemistry]].
