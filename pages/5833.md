## Summary

There are various related theorems in [[functional analysis]] and [[measure theory]] stating, under appropriate conditions, that the [[dual space|topological duals]] of various familiar [[Banach spaces]] (or something similar) are other familiar Banach spaces.  Most of these are due in part to [[Frigyes Riesz]], and many of them are named after him.  Here we will consider them all together.

Throughout, we use notation for integrals in which unnecessary ‘$\mathrm{d}$’s are dropped; see the discussion on notation at [[measure space]].


## $\overline{C_c^*}^+ = \overline{RBM}^+$

Let $X$ be a [[locally compact Hausdorff space]].  Let $C_c(X)$ be the space of [[continuous functions]] on $X$ (valued in the [[complex numbers]]) with [[compact subset|compact]] [[support]] with the [[supremum norm]]; the [[dual space]] $C_c(X)^*$ of this is (of course) the space of [[bounded map|bounded]] [[linear functional]]s on $C_c(X)$; and the [[extended positive cone]] $\overline{C_c(X)^*}^+$ of this is the space of (possibly unbounded) [[positive linear functional]]s on $C_c(X)$.  Let $RBM(X)$ be the space of [[finite measure|finite]] [[regular Borel measure]]s on $X$ with the [[total variation]] norm; the [[extended positive cone]] $\overline{RBM(X)}^+$ of this is the space of [[positive measure|positive]] regular Borel measures on $X$.  [[integral|Integration]] gives a map from $\overline{RBM(X)}^+$ to $\overline{C_c(X)^*}^+$:
$$ \mu \mapsto (f \mapsto \int_X f \mu) .$$

###### Theorem (Riesz)
This map is an [[isometric isomorphism]]:
$$ \overline{C_c(X)^*}^+ \cong \overline{RBM(X)}^+ .$$

Since these are not Banach spaces, let us explain what an isometric isomorphism is: these are [[extended conical spaces]] and [[extended metric spaces]], and we ask for a [[bijection]] that preserves those structures.


## $C_0^* = RBM$

Let $X$ be a [[locally compact Hausdorff space]].  Let $C_0(X)$ be the space of [[continuous functions]] on $X$ (valued in the [[complex numbers]]) on the [[one-point compactification]] of $X$ (so vanishing 'at infinity') with the [[supremum norm]].  Let $RBM(X)$ be the space of [[finite measure|finite]] [[Borel measure]]s on $X$ with the [[total variation]] norm.  [[integral|Integration]] gives a map from $RBM(X)$ to the [[dual space]] $C_0(X)^*$ of $C_0(X)$:
$$ \mu \mapsto (f \mapsto \int_X f \mu) .$$

###### Theorem (Riesz--Markov)
This map is an [[isometric isomorphism]]:
$$ C_0(X)^* \cong RBM(X) .$$
