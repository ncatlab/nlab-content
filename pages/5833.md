## Summary

There are various related theorems in [[functional analysis]] and [[measure theory]] stating, under appropriate conditions, that the [[dual vector space|topological linear duals]] of various familiar [[Banach spaces]] (or something similar) are other familiar Banach spaces.  Most of these are due in part to [[Frigyes Riesz]], and many of them are named after him.  Here we will consider them all together.

Throughout, we use notation for integrals in which unnecessary ‘$\mathrm{d}$’s are dropped; see the discussion on notation at [[measure space]].


## $C_c^{{*}{+}} = \overline{RM}^+$

Let $X$ be a [[locally compact Hausdorff space]].  Let $C_c(X)$ be the space of [[continuous functions]] on $X$ (valued in the [[complex numbers]]) with [[compact subset|compact]] [[support]]; make $C_c(X)$ into a [[locally convex space]] with the topology of [[uniform convergence topology|uniform convergence on compact subsets]]; the [[dual vector space]] $C_c(X)*$ of this is (of course) the space of [[continuous map|continuous]] [[linear functional]]s on $C_c(X)$; and the [[positive cone]] $C_c(X)^{{*}{+}}$ of this is the space of [[positive linear functional]]s on $C_c(X)$.  Let $RM(X)$ be the space of [[finite measure|finite]] [[Radon measure]]s on $X$; make $RM(X)$ into a [[Banach space]] with the [[total variation]] norm; the [[extended positive cone]] $\overline{RM(X)}^+$ of this is the space of [[positive measure|positive]] Radon measures on $X$.  [[integral|Integration]] gives a map from $\overline{RM(X)}^+$ to $C_c(X)^{{*}{+}}$:
$$ \mu \mapsto (f \mapsto \int_X f \mu) .$$

###### Theorem (Riesz)
This map is a [[homeomorphism]]:
$$ C_c(X)^{{*}{+}} \cong \overline{RM(X)}^+ .$$

## $C_0^* = RM$

Let $X$ be a [[locally compact Hausdorff space]].  Let $C_0(X)$ be the space of [[continuous functions]] on $X$ (valued in the [[complex numbers]]) on the [[one-point compactification]] of $X$ (so vanishing 'at infinity'); make $C_0(X)$ into a [[Banach space]] with the [[supremum norm]].  Let $RM(X)$ be the space of [[finite measure|finite]] [[Radon measure]]s on $X$; make $RM(X)$ into a [[Banach space]] with the [[total variation]] norm.  [[integral|Integration]] gives a map from $RM(X)$ to the [[dual vector space]] $C_0(X)^*$ of $C_0(X)$:
$$ \mu \mapsto (f \mapsto \int_X f \mu) .$$

###### Theorem (Riesz--Markov)
This map is an [[isometric isomorphism]]:
$$ C_0(X)^* \cong RM(X) .$$
