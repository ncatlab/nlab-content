## Idea
 {#Idea}

Intersection theory studies literally the [[intersection]] of pairs of sub-spaces inside an ambient [[space]]. Historically [[Bézout's theorem]] described the signed ([[integer]]-valued) [[number]] of points at which two [[algebraic curves]] meet transversally inside an ambient [[algebraic surface]]. Dually, under [[Poincaré duality]], this integer is the evaluation of the [[cup product]] of the duals of the two [[fundamental classes]] of the curves on that of the ambient spaces, and hence the [[cup product]] on mid-degree cohomology classes is also called the _[[intersection product]]_ and is one central aspect of intersection theory.

However, if the sub-spaces do not intersect sufficiently transversally, then their plain set-theoretic number of intersection points will not agree with the cohomological [[intersection product]] thus defined. Historically [[Serre's intersection formula]] was a first step to remedy this by replacing the plain [[tensor product]] of [[structure sheaves]] (which is what [[Isbell duality|dually]] describes the [[intersection]] of the [[varieties]]) by a [[Tor]], hence by its [[derived functor]]. 

In the modern version of the theory (as indicated e.g. in the introduction of ([Lurie-Spaces](#LurieSpaces))) this is interpreted as saying that the intersection is to be taken in _[[derived algebraic geometry]]_ (and the fundamental classes are to be taken to be [[virtual fundamental classes]]). 

With intersection theory interpreted in [[(infinity,1)-topos theory]] this way then the nature of B&#233;zout's original statement should hold in full generality essentially without further assumptions and this would be the central statement of intersection theory:

_the [[cup product]] of two [[virtual fundamental classes]] of mid-dimensional subspaces  equals the fundamental class of their derived intersection_.
