In material [[set theory]], a [[pure set]] $S$ is called __transitive__ if $a\in b\in S$ implies that $a\in S$.  Note that this does _not_ mean that $\in$ is a transitive binary relation on $S$ itself.  In fact, assuming the [[axiom of foundation]], $\in$ is a transitive relation on $S$ precisely when $S$ is a von Neumann [[ordinal number]].

Transitive sets are a natural place to look for [[inner model]]s of material set theory: that is, sets $S$ such that $S$ together with the restriction of $\in$ to $S$ satisfies some or all of the axioms of set theory.  Similarly, they may be used to model [[pure set]]s in structural [[set theory]].
