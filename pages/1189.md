In material [[set theory]], a [[pure set]] $S$ is called __transitive__ if $a\in b\in S$ implies that $a\in S$.  Note that this does _not_ mean that $\in$ is a transitive binary relation on $S$ itself.  In fact, assuming the [[axiom of foundation]], $\in$ is a transitive relation on $S$ precisely when $S$ is a von Neumann [[ordinal number]].

Transitive sets are a natural place to look for [[inner model]]s of material set theory: that is, sets $S$ such that $S$ together with the restriction of $\in$ to $S$ satisfies some or all of the axioms of set theory.  Similarly, they may be used to model [[pure set]]s in structural [[set theory]] through the notion of a set equipped with an [[extensional relation]].

Assuming enough set-theoretic axioms (far less than [[ZFC]] suffices), every pure set $x$ is contained in a least transitive pure set, called its **transitive closure**.  This can be defined as the set of all $y$ such that there is a chain $y = x_n \in \cdots \in x_0 = x$ for some [[natural number]] $n$.
