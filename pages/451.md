I began studying categories as a necessary foundation for mathematical physics and low dimensional topology. Now they continually tempt me away from Hopf algebras, geometric combinatorics and knot concordance.

My favorites are the structured (braided, iterated monoidal) and the enriched. For papers, notes, and my students' work here is [my web page](http://www.math.uakron.edu/~sf34/) and my [research projects](http://www.math.uakron.edu/~sf34/class_home/research.htm).
