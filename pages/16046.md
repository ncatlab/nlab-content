## Idea

What is known as the _prime geodesic theorem_ is a result that descrives the [[asymptotic]] distribution of [[prime geodesics]] on a [[hyperbolic manifold]]. 

The prime geodesic theorem is [[analogy|analogous]] to the [[prime number theorem]]. Just as the zeros of the [[Riemann zeta function]] control the error term in the prime number theorem, so the zeros of the [[Selberg zeta function]] control the error term in the prime geodesic theorem.
