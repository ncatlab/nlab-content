## Idea

What is known as the _prime geodesic theorem_ is a result that descrives the [[asymptotic]] distribution of [[prime geodesics]] on a [[hyperbolic manifold]]. 

The prime geodesic theorem is [[analogy|analogous]] to the [[prime number theorem]]. Just as the zeros of the [[Riemann zeta function]] control the error term in the prime number theorem, so the zeros of the [[Selberg zeta function]] control the error term in the prime geodesic theorem.

## Statement

Let $X$ be a [[hyperbolic manifold]] of [[dimension]] $d + 1$. Let

$$
  \Gamma \coloneqq \pi_1(X)
$$

be its [[fundamental group]]. 

For each element $\gamma \in \Gamma$ there exists one closed [[geodesic]] in $X$ representing it. By standard convenient abuse of notation we write $\gamma$ also for that geodesic. Write

* $l(\gamma)$ for the [[length]] of the geodesic $\gamma$;

* $N(\gamma) \coloneqq e^{l(\gamma)}$ for what is called its _norm_;

* $\pi_\Gamma(x)$ for the number of primitive elements $\gamma \in \Gamma$ such that $N(\gamma) \leq x$.

The _prime geodesic theorem_ is a statement of the form that this number $\pi_\Gamma(x)$ satisfies

$$
  \pi_\Gamma(x)
  =
  li(x^d)
  + 
  \underoverset{n = 0}{N}{\sum} li(x^{s_n}) + (error\;term)
$$

where 

* $li(x) = \underoverset{0}{x}{\int}\frac{d t}{ln t}$ is the [[logarithmic integral function]];

* $\{s_1, \cdots, s_N\}$ are the zeros of the [[Selberg zeta function]] in the interval $(d/2,d)$

* $(error\;term)$ is some term, estimates of which are the main content of this class of theorems.
