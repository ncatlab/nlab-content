on [[higher algebra]] ([[brave new algebra]]) in [[stable homotopy theory]], i.e. on [[ring spectra]], [[module spectra]] etc. This was the first to give a symmetric [[monoidal model category]] of [[spectra]] (called [[S-modules]]), in which $A_\infty$ and $E_\infty$-[[ring spectra]] could be defined as ordinary monoids and modules. 
The book is sometimes referred to as *EKMM* for short, after the initials of its authors.
