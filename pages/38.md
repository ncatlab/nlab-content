## Classical Lie theory and beyond

__Lie theory__ (wikipedia: [Lie theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_theory)) is the study of [[Lie groups]], [[Lie algebras]], their actions as groups of transformations, their representations, their 
cousins ([[Chevalley group]]s, [[quantum group]]s, Banach Lie groups, [[Lie bialgebra]]s, [[universal enveloping algebra]]s)
and categorifications (higher Lie groups, $L_\infty$-[[L-infinity-algebra|algebras]] etc.), including horizontal: [[Lie groupoid]], [[Lie algebroid]], $L_\infty$-[[L-infinity-algebroid|algebroid]]. 

[[Lie group]] is a [[group|groups]] [[internalization|internal to]] [[Diff]]. The [[Lie algebras]] over real or complex numbers appear 
as the linearization of real or complex Lie groups; the infinitesimal version of Lie groups are [[local Lie group]]s. The relation between real Lie algebras and real Lie groups was established by [[Lie's three theorems]] and the study of this correspondence is the classical Lie theory in narrow sense. 

In a categorical context there are the usual two generalization of Lie groups: the [[horizontal categorification]] -- or oidification -- which adds _more objects_ and leads to _Lie groupoids_; and the [[vertical categorification]] which adds _higher morphisms_ and leads to $\infty$-Lie groups and $\infty$-Lie groupoids. This is described below.

In the course of these categorifications one usually finds that working [[internalization|internal to]] $Diff$ is too restrictive for many purposes. Therefore higher Lie theory is often considered internal to [[generalized smooth space|generalized smooth spaces]].


## Lie groupoids versus Lie algebroids

[[horizontal categorification|Oidification]] leads from Lie groups to [[Lie groupoid|Lie groupoids]]
and from [[Lie algebra|Lie algebras]] to 
[[Lie algebroid|Lie algebroids]].

When it was found that Lie algebroids integrate to Lie groupoids by mapping paths into them, not only a "well known" but apparently also well forgotten way to integrate Lie algebras by means of paths was rediscovered, but also the idea to integrate higher Lie algebroids by mapping higher dimenmsional paths into them was clearly suggested.

### Lie 1-groupoids vs. Lie algebroids

The study of Lie theory of Lie groupoids and Lie algebroids was notably motivated by Alan Weinstein's studies of [[geometric quantization]] of [[Poisson manifold|Poisson manifolds]], as well as by [[Kirill Mackenzie|Kirill Mackenzieâ€™s]] work. 

The canonical review for the integration theory of Lie algebroids (and hence for Lie algebras by the **path integration method**) is:

* Marius Crainic, Rui Loja Fernandes, _Lectures on Integrability of Lie Brackets_, ([arXiv](http://aps.arxiv.org/abs/math.DG/0611259),[blog](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/05/integrability_of_lie_brackets.html)).

This focuses on integration to [[Lie groupoid|Lie groupoids]] proper, i.e. to integration internal to manifolds. In contrast to Lie algebras, not every Lie algebroid integrates to such a proper [[Lie groupoid]], though: the space of morphisms of the Lie groupoid is a quotient of paths in the Lie algebroid by Lie algebroid homotopies, and this quotient may not exist as a manifold. (Crainic and Fernandes [discuss](http://aps.arxiv.org/abs/math.DG/0611259) the obstruction in detail.) But the quotient of course always exists as a [[weak quotient]] or [[homotopy quotient]] or [[stacky quotient]] itself. The result of realizing the space of morphisms of the integrated Lie algebroid as such a stacky quotient has been studied by [Chenchang Zhu](http://chenchangzhu.blogspot.com/):
