## Idea
 {#Idea}

A _graph complex_ is a certain [[cochain complex]] [[linear span|spanned]] by [[equivalence classes]] of certain labeled [[directed graphs]], whose [[differential]] encodes the operation of contracting away [[edges]] in a graph.

Two similar but different classes of examples are usually referred to by default as just "the graph complex", going back to hints in [Kontsevich 92, P. 11-12](#Kontsevich92), [Kontsevich 93, 5](#Kontsevich93):

Given a [[smooth manifold]] $\Sigma$, often taken to be [[Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^D$, there is

1. a [graph complex model for the real cohomology of the unlabeled ordered configuration space of points](#IdeaGraphComplexModelsForConfigurationSpacesOfPoints) in $\Sigma$

1. a [graph complex model for the real cohomology of the space of knots](#IdeaGraphComplexModelForSpacesOfKnots) in $\Sigma$.

In both cases, the graphs are interpreted as [[Feynman diagrams]] for [[Chern-Simons theory]] and the map which identifies these with [[cocycles]] in [[real cohomology]] of either the (unlabeled & ordered) [[configuration space of points]] or the [[space of knots]] is given by sending a Feynman diagram to its [[Feynman amplitude]]. In the first case this is an [[n-point function]], [[correlator as differential form on configuration space of points|regarded as a differential form on the configuration space]] of $n$-points, while in the second case this is a [[vacuum amplitude]] depending on the [[isotopy]] [[equivalence class|class]] of the  [[Wilson loop]] encoded by the [[knot]] -- a [[Vassiliev knot invariant]].

\linebreak

**Beware** that these graph complex models **differ only in very small technical detail** as the manifold $\Sigma$ varies and the choice between models for configuration space of points or spaces of knots is made (see the [Overview of definitions](#OverviewOfDefinitions) below), and yet these small details **completely change the cohomological nature** of the resulting graph complexes; a point not often made manifest when any given author discusses  "the graph complex".

### Model for ordered configuration spaces of points
 {#IdeaGraphComplexModelsForConfigurationSpacesOfPoints}


The graph complex model for unlabeled & ordered [[configuration spaces of points]] was originally sketched in [Kontsevich 92 (p. 11-12)](#Kontsevich92) and worked out in detail in [Lambrechts-Volić 14](#LambrechtsVolic14) for $\Sigma = \mathbb{R}^D$ a [[Euclidean space]]. Other authors have claimed generalization to $\Sigma$ a [[closed manifold]] ([Campos-Willwacher 16](#CamposWillwacher16)) possibly [[manifold with boundary|with boundary]] ([Campos-Idrissi-Lambrechts-Willwacher 18](#CamposIdrissiLambrechtsWillwacher18)).

Here we denote this version of the graph complex by "$Graphs$", in contrast to "$KnotGraphs$" for the other model, discussed further [below](#IdeaGraphComplexModelForSpacesOfKnots).

</div>



This graph complex is [[linear span|spanned]] by [[finite set|finite]] [[directed graphs]] with [[linear order|linearly ordered]] internal and external [[vertices]], subject to a sign rule reflecting the [[orientation]] of [[edges]]. The [[differential]] sends any graph to a signed sum of graphs obtained by contracting one of the [[edges]] with at least one internal vertex. 

Under ordered disjoint union of edges and _internal_ vertices this [[cochain complex]] becomes a [[differential graded-commutative algebra]]

$$
  Graphs_n\big( \mathbb{R}^D \big)
  \;\in\;
  dgcAlg_{\mathbb{R}}
  \phantom{AA}
  n, D \in \mathbb{N}
  \,,
$$

As such, this is [[quasi-isomorphism|quasi-isomorphic]] to the semi-algebraic [[de Rham algebra]]


$$
  \Omega^\bullet
  \big(
    \underset{{}^{1,\cdots,n}}{Conf}
    \big( 
      \Sigma
    \big)
  \big)
  \;\in\;
  dgcAlg_{\mathbb{R}}
  \phantom{AA}
  n, D \in \mathbb{N}
$$

of the [[Fulton-MacPherson compactification]] of the [[configuration space of points]] $\underset{{}^{1,\cdots,n}}{Conf}(\mathbb{R}^D)$ for $n$ points in $D$-dimensional [[Euclidean space]].

The [[chain map]] which exhibits this [[quasi-isomorphism]] is given by regarding a graph as a [[Feynman diagram]] for [[Chern-Simons theory]] on $\Sigma = \mathbb{R}^D$ and sending it to its corresponding [[Feynman amplitude]], namely to the [[configuration space of points|configuration space]]-[[integral]] of the [[wedge product]] of [[Chern-Simons propagators]] associated to the [[edges]], regarding [[Feynman amplitudes as differential forms on configuration spaces of points]]:

      \phantom{A}

      \\
      \text{of n-point Feynman diagrams}
      \\
      \text{for Chern-Simons theory}
      \\
      \text{on} \; \Sigma 
    }
  }{
    Graphs_n(\Sigma)
  }
  \underoverset{
    \simeq_{\mathrlap{qi}}
  }
  {
    \color{blue}
    \array{
      \text{assign Feynman amplitudes}
      \\
      \text{of Chern-Simons theory}
      \\
      \phantom{A}
    }
  }
  {
    \longrightarrow
  }
  \underset{

      \\
      \text{ordered configuration space}
      \\

    }
  }{
  \Omega^\bullet
  \big(
    \underset{{}^{ \{1,\cdots,n \} }}{Conf}\big(  \Sigma \big)
  \big)
  }
  \,.
\]

This means that for each [[edge]] in a [[graph]] a [[Chern-Simons propagator]] is assigned, and for each of $n_{int} \in \mathbb{N}$ internal [[vertices]] the [[wedge product]] of its adjacent [[Chern-Simons propagators]] is [[fiber integral|fiber integrated]] along the canonical [[fibration]] of [[configuration spaces of points]]:

$$
  \underset{
    {}^{\{1, \cdots, n + n_{int} \}}
  }{
    Conf
  }
  \big(
    \mathbb{R}^D 
  \big)
  \longrightarrow
  \underset{
    {}^{\{1,\cdots,n\}}
  }{
    Conf
  }
  \big( 
    \mathbb{R}^D 
  \big)
$$

just as befits the definition of a [[Feynman amplitude]] when [[correlator as differential form on configuration space of points|regarding them as differential forms on configuration spaces of points]].


\linebreak

### Model for spaces of knots  
 {#IdeaGraphComplexModelForSpacesOfKnots}

The graph complex model for [[spaces of knots]] was originally sketched in [Kontsevich 93, Section 5](#Kontsevich93) and worked out in [Cattaneo, Cotta-Ramusino, Longoni 02](#CattaneoCottaRamusinoLongoni02), [05](#CattaneoCottaRamusinoLongoni05), see also [Bar-Natan 91](#BarNatan91).

Here we denote this version of the graph complex by "$KnotGraphs$", in contrast to "$Graphs$" for the other model, discussed [above](#IdeaGraphComplexModelsForConfigurationSpacesOfPoints).

<div style="float:right;margin:0 10px 10px 0;">
<img src="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/AKnotGraphInTheKnotGraphComplexII.jpg" width="190">
</div>


The explicit definition is almost exactly the same as that of the model for configuration spaces of points [above](#IdeaGraphComplexModelsForConfigurationSpacesOfPoints), except that the external vertices here have a degree -1 instead of 0, and that the differential sees contractible [[edges]] between consecutive external vertices, often called _arcs_, shown by dashed lines on the right.

Together these two innocent modifications make the graphs now represent [[vacuum amplitude|vacuum]] [[Feynman diagrams]] for [[Chern-Simons theory]] in the presence of a [[Wilson loop]], with the external vertices now attached to this [[knot]] (corresponding to the dashed line shown on the right):

\[
  \label{KnotGraphsTheQuasiIsomorphism}
  \underset{
    \color{blue}
    \array{
      \phantom{A}
      \\
      \text{graph complex}
      \\
      \text{of n-point Feynman diagrams}
      \\
      \text{for Chern-Simons theory}
      \\
      \text{on} \; \Sigma 
      \\
      \text{in the presence of a Wilson loop knot}
    }
  }{
    KnotGraphs_n(\Sigma)
  }
  \underoverset{
  }
  {
    \color{blue}
    \array{
      \text{assign Feynman amplitudes}
      \\
      \text{of Chern-Simons theory}
      \\
      \phantom{A}
    }
  }
  {
    \longrightarrow
  }
  \underset{
    \color{blue}
    \array{
      \phantom{A}
      \\
      \text{de Rham algebra}
      \\
      \text{of the space of knots}
      \\
      \text{in}\; \Sigma
      \\
      \text{(higher Vassiliev knot invariants)}
    }
  }{
  \Omega^\bullet
  \big(
    Emb(S^1,  \Sigma \big)
  \big)
  }
  \,.
\]


This yields higher [[Vassiliev knot invariants]], a good review is in [Volić 13](#Volic13).

\linebreak

### Model for other spaces

There are yet other, inequivalent, graph complexes. Notably there is a type of graph complex whose (co)homology in degree 0 is the [[Lie algebra]] of the [[Grothendieck-Teichmüller group]] ([Willwacher 10](#Willwacher10), [Dolgushev-Rogers 12](#DolgushevRogers12)), and this is neither of the above two cases. (...)



## Definition
 {#GraphComplex}

### Overview
 {#OverviewOfDefinitions}

There are two different classes of (Kontsevich-) graph complexes, modelling the [[real cohomology]] of, respectively,

| [[configuration space]]   |    |   |  [[graph complex]]  |  |
|----|----|---|----|--|
| [[configuration spaces of points]] | $\underset{{}^{1,\cdots,n}}{Conf}(\Sigma)$ | $\;\;\leftrightarrow\;\;$ | $Graphs_n(\Sigma)$ |  [(1)](#GraphComplexesModellingConfigurationSpacesOfPoints) |  
| [[spaces of knots]] | $Emb(S^1,\Sigma)$ | $\;\;\leftrightarrow\;\;$ | $KnotGraphs(\Sigma)$ | [(2)](#GraphComplexesModellingSpacesOfKnots) |

Despite their very deifferent cohomological nature, the explicit definitions of these two kinds of graph complexes are mostly identical, except for some small but crucial difference in the definition of degrees and labels of edges (see [below](#KnotGraphsDefinition)).

In addition, the definition of the graph complex model for configuration spaces of points depends on a choice of [[smooth manifold]] $\Sigma$, possibly [[manifold with boundary|with boundary]], namely such that the graph complex $Graphs(\Sigma)$ provides a model for the cohomology of the [[configuration space of points]] in $\Sigma$

$$
  Graphs\big( \Sigma \big)
  \leftrightarrow
  \Omega^\bullet\big(  Conf(\Sigma) \big)
  \,.
$$

The [[configuration spaces of points]] are naturally [[filtering|filtered]] by [[subspaces]] of a fixed number $n \in \mathbb{N}$ of points. In the graph complexes this correpsonds to graphs with a fixed number $n$ of _external_ vertices:


$$
  \underset{
    \mathclap{
    \color{blue}
    \array{
       \phantom{A}
       \\
       \text{graphs with}
       \\
        n\;\text{external vertices}
    }
    }
  }{
    Graphs_n\big( \Sigma\big)
  }
  \;\;\;\leftrightarrow\;\;\;
  \Omega^\bullet\big(
     \underset{
       \mathclap{
       \color{blue}
       \array{
         \phantom{A}
         \\
         \text{configuration space}
         \\
         \text{of}\;n\;\text{points}
       }
       }
     }{  
       \underbrace{
         \underset{{}^{1,\cdots,n}}{Conf}(\Sigma) 
       }
     }
  \big)
  \,.
$$

The full graph complexes/configuration spaces are just the [[direct sum]]/[[union]] of those for fixed number $n$ of external vertices/points, hence one may focus attention on the latter.

The precise form of these relations is the content of the theorems discussed below. Before stating this in detail, we make some general remarks on how the situation depends on $\Sigma$:


Beware that the graphs $[\Gamma] \in Graphs_n(\Sigma)$ themselves are _not_ going to carry an embedding into the manifold $\Sigma$, they are just abstract graphs. But the construction of the above correspondence to the cohomology of the configuration space of points is given by associating with a graph the corresponding [[correlator as differential form on configuration space of points|correlator]] in a [[Chern-Simons theory|Chern-Simons]] [[perturbative quantum field theory]] on the space $\Sigma$.

As a consequence, the dependence of the graph complexes themselves on $\Sigma$ is mild:

In particular, in the case that $\Sigma = \mathbb{R}^D$ is a [[Euclidean space]], the corresponding graph complexes $Graphs\big( \mathbb{R}^D \big)$ depend essentially only on whether the [[dimension]] $D$ is [[even number|even]] or [[odd number|odd]]. Concretely, the degree of a graph in the [[graded vector space]] $Graphs_n(\mathbb{R}^D)$ is

\[
  \label{DegreeOfAGraph}
  deg\big( [\Gamma]\big) 
  \;=\;
  (D-1) \cdot \#\!Edges - D \cdot \#\!Vertices_{int}
  \,,
\]

hence each [[edge]] contributes a degree $D-1$ and each internal vertex a degree $-D$. As a consequence,  due to the [[signs in supergeometry|sign rule]] in the [[graded-commutative algebra]] [[structure]] on $Graphs_n(\mathbb{R}^D)$ we have the following parities

|   $\Sigma = \mathbb{R}^D$ | edges | internal vertices |
|-------------------|-------|-------------------|
| $D$ even |  odd  | even |
| $D$ odd  | even | odd | 

Up to an absolute _even_ change of grading, the graph complexes $Graphs_n(\mathbb{R}^D)$ depend only on these parities, hence depend only on whether $D$ is [[even number|even]] or [[odd number|odd]].
 
Finally, beware that many authors consider the case where $\Sigma = \mathbb{R}^D$ by default, and don't mention a dependence on a choice of manifold, but just on a natural number $D$. This natural number is then often denoted "$d$" or "$n$".

For instance:

* the "graph complex with anti-symmetric set of edges" of [Bar-Natan & McKay, Def. 3.3](#BarNatanMcKay) is denoted $GC_2$ in [Willwacher 10](#Willwacher10) and is our $Graphs_0\big(\mathbb{R}^2\big)$;

* similarly $GC_3$ in [Koroshkin-Willwacher-Živković 14](#KoroshkinWillwacherZivkovic14) is our $KnotGraphs\big( \mathbb{R}^3\big)$.

(While the cohomology of $Graphs_0(\Sigma)$ -- being equivalent to that of $Conf_0(\Sigma) \simeq \ast$ -- is trivial, these authors consider further filtrations which have non-trivial cohomology in filtration stages, see [Bar-Natan & McKay, Def. 3.6](#BarNatanMcKay)).

### **1)** Graph complexes modelling configuration spaces of points
 {#GraphComplexesModellingConfigurationSpacesOfPoints}

We discuss graph complexes $Graphs_n(\Sigma)$ modelling the [[real cohomology]] of [[configuration spaces of points]] $\underset{{}^{1,\cdots,n}}{Conf}(\Sigma)$. 

For the case of $\Sigma = \mathbb{R}^D$ these were originally hinted at in [Kontsevich 92 (p. 11-12)](#Kontsevich92) and discussed in detail in [Lambrechts-Volić 14](#LambrechtsVolic14).

\linebreak

#### $Graphs_n\big( \mathbb{R}^3 \big)$
{#GraphComplexForConfigurationsOfPointsInR3}


We state the definition of the graph complexes $Graphs_n\big( \mathbb{R}^3\big)$ (as motivated [above](#IdeaGraphComplexModelsForConfigurationSpacesOfPoints), see Def. \ref{GraphComplexDgcAlgebra} below) associated with [[Euclidean space]] of [[dimension]] 3, following [Lambrechts-Volić 14, Section 6](#LambrechtsVolic14).


##### Graphs

+-- {: .num_defn #Graphs}
###### Definition
**(graphs)**

In the following, by a **[[graph]]** we mean specifically:

1. a [[finite set|finite]] [[directed graph]] 

   $$
     Edg \underoverset{t}{s}{\rightrightarrows} Vert
     \,,
   $$

1. a decomposition  of the [[finite set]] $Vert$ of [[vertices]] as a [[disjoint union]]

   $$
     Vert \simeq Vert_{ext} \sqcup Vert_{int}
   $$

   of "external" and "internal" vertices.

1. a [[linear order]] on $Vert$, such that $Vert_{ext} \lt Vert_{int}$.

Hence both $Vert_{ext}$ and $Vert_{int}$ are [[linear orders]], and 

$$
  Vert = Vert_{ext} \sqcup_{{}_{\lt}} Vert_{int}
$$

is their ordered [[disjoint union]].

An [[isomorphism]] $\Gamma \simeq \Gamma'$ of such graphs is a [[pair]] of [[bijections]] between sets of edges and vertices

\[
  \label{IsomorphismOfGraphs}
  \array{
    Edg &\underoverset{t}{s}{\rightrightarrows}& Vert_{ext} \sqcup Vert_{int}
    \\
    \mathllap{{}^{\simeq}}\big\downarrow
    &&
    \mathllap{{}^{\simeq}}\big\downarrow
    \\
    Edg' &\underoverset{t'}{s'}{\rightrightarrows}& Vert'_{ext} \sqcup Vert'_{int}
  }
\]

which respects all [[structure]], hence the [[source]] and [[target]] maps, the decomposition into external and internal vertices, and the [[linear order]].


=--

([Lambrechts-Volić 14, Def. 6.1](#LambrechtsVolic14))


+-- {: .num_remark #EmptyGraph}
###### Remark
**([[empty graph]])**

The [[empty graph]] counts as a graph, according to Def. \ref{Graphs}.

=--


We write $\#\! Vert \coloneqq \left\vert Vert \right\vert$ for the [[cardinality]] of the sets of vertices, etc.


+-- {: .num_defn #DenotationForLinearOrderOnVertices}
###### Remark
**(denotation for linear order on vertices)**

The  [[linear order]] on the [[vertices]] in Def. \ref{Graphs} is equivalently a choice of [[bijection]] of $Vert$ with the set of the first $\#\!Vert$ [[natural numbers]]

\[
  \label{NaturalNumberLabelsOfVertices}
  Vert
  \;\simeq\;
  \big\{
    1, 2, \ldots, \# Vert_{ext}, \# Vert_{ext} + 1, \ldots , \# Vert_{ext} + \# Vert_{int}
  \big\}
\]

With this understood, we may depict graphs as as diagrams with oriented edges and numbered vertices.

=--



+-- {: .num_defn #DegreeOfAGraph}
###### Definition
**(degree of a graph)**

Given a graph 

$$
  \Gamma
  \;=\;       
  \big(
    Edg 
      \underoverset{t}{s}{\rightrightarrows} 
    Vert_{ext} 
      \sqcup
    Vert_{int}
  \big)
$$

according to Def. \ref{Graphs}, its _degree_ is the [[natural number]]

$$
  deg(\Gamma)
  \;\coloneqq\;
  2 \cdot \#\!Edg
  -
  3 \cdot \#\!Vert_{int}
  \,,
$$

hence the sum of 2 for each [[edge]] and of -3 for each internal [[vertex]].

=--

([Lambrechts-Volić 14, Def. 6.6](#LambrechtsVolic14))


If we also agree to

1. denote internal vertices by a bullet;

1. denote external vertices by... _no_ denotation (as usual for [[Feynman diagrams]]!)

then the ingredients of these graphs are as shown in the following figure:

<center>
<img src="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/GraphComplexIngredients.jpg" width="880">
</center>

The following shows some very simple examples of graphs, depicted this way:


<center>
<img src="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/SomeExamplesOfGraphs.jpg" width="610">
</center>

**Beware** that graphs need not be [[planar graph|planar]], may have edges between two external vertices (chords) and other effects not seen in these simple examples (... need to draw more generic examples...). 

In particular, graphs may have [[tadpoles]]. But the next definition makes such graphs vanish in the graph complex:

+-- {: .num_defn #SignRulesForGraphs}
###### Definition
**(sign rules for graphs)**

For a fixed [[finite set|finite]] [[linear order]] $Vert_{ext} \simeq \{1, 2, \cdots, \#\!Vert_{ext}\}$, consider the [[real numbers|real]] [[linear span]] on the [[set]] of [[isomorphism classes]] (eq:IsomorphismOfGraphs) of graphs, according to Def. \ref{Graphs}, with that set of external [[vertices]]:

\[
  \label{LinearSpanOfIsoClassesOfGraphs}
  \mathbb{R}
  \Big[
    \big\{
     Edg 
      \underoverset{t}{s}{\rightrightarrows} 
     Vert_{ext} 
      \sqcup
     Vert_{int}
     \;\vert\;
     Vert_{int} \in FinLinOrd
    \big\}_{/\sim}
  \Big]
  \;\in\;
  Vect_{\mathbb{R}}
  \,.
\]

The degree associated with a graph (Def. \ref{DegreeOfAGraph}) makes this a [[graded vector space]].

On this [[real vector space]], consider the linear [[equivalence relation]]  $\sim$ generated by 


\[
  \label{SignFromOrientationReversal}
  \Gamma
  \;\sim\;
  -\Gamma'
  \phantom{AA}
  \array{
    \text{if}\;\Gamma'\; \text{is}\;\Gamma\;\text{with}
    \\
    \text{orientation of one edge reversed}
  }
\]


<center>
<img src="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/GraphComplexSignsFromOrientationReversal.jpg" width="400">
</center>



and


\[
  \label{SignRuleFromOrderingInternalVertices}
  \Gamma
  \;\sim\;
  -\Gamma'
  \phantom{AA}
  \array{
    \text{if}\;\Gamma'\;\text{is}\;\Gamma\;\text{with}
    \\
    \text{a pair of consecutive internal vertices transposed}
  }
\]


=--

([Lambrechts-Volić 14, Def. 6.5 & Def. 6.5](#LambrechtsVolic14))

Since this [[equivalence relation]] is linear, the set of its [[equivalence classes]] is still a [[vector space]], and since the equivalence relation also preserves the degrees (Def. \ref{DegreeOfAGraph}), it is still a [[graded vector space]]:


+-- {: .num_defn #GradedVectorSpaceOfGraphs}
###### Definition
**(graded vector space of graphs)**

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $n \coloneqq \#\! Vert_{ext}$, we write


\[
  \label{VectorSpaceOfGraphsWithSignRulesImposed}
  \widehat{Graphs}_n\big(\mathbb{R}^3\big)
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \mathbb{R}
  \Big[
    \big\{
     Edg 
      \underoverset{s}{t}{\rightrightarrows} 
     Vert_{ext} 
      \sqcup
     Vert_{int}
     \;\vert\;
     Vert_{int} \in FinLinOrd
    \big\}_{/\sim}
  \Big]_{/\sim}
  \;\in\;
  Vect_{\mathbb{R}}
  \,.
\]

for the [[real vector space|real]] [[graded vector space]] of [[equivalence classes]] under the sign rules (eq:SignFromOrientationReversal) and (eq:SignRuleFromOrderingInternalVertices) in the [[linear span]] (eq:LinearSpanOfIsoClassesOfGraphs) of the [[isomorphism classes]] of graphs (Def. \ref{Graphs}) with $n$ external vertices.

For $\Gamma$ any graph, we write 

\[
  \label{EquivalenceClassOfAGraphForSignRules}
  \big[ \Gamma \big]
  \;\in\;
  \widehat{Graphs}_n\big(\mathbb{R}^3\big)
  \,.
\]

for the [[equivalence class]] of the element in this [[real vector space|real]] [[graded vector space]] that it represents. 

When there is not risk of confusion, we will still refer to this equivalence class $[\Gamma]$ as a _graph_.

=--



A further [[quotient space]] $Graphs_n(\mathbb{R}^3)$ of $\widehat Graphs_n(\mathbb{R}^3)$ (eq:VectorSpaceOfGraphsWithSignRulesImposed) will underly the actual graph complex [below](#TheGraphComplex).



+-- {: .num_example #GraphsWithDirectLoopsVanish}
###### Example
**(no tadpoles)**

A direct consequence of quotienting out the [[equivalence relation]]
(eq:SignFromOrientationReversal)
is that graphs with "[[tadpoles]]", namely with edges
that have coinciding [[source]] and [[target]] [[vertex]], 
vanish in $\widehat Graphs_n(\mathbb{R}^3)$ (eq:VectorSpaceOfGraphsWithSignRulesImposed):

$$
  e \in Edg_\Gamma

###### Example
**(trivalent graphs)**

A graph without external vertices has degree (Def. \ref{DegreeOfAGraph}) equal to zero precisely if all its vertices (which are all internal, by assumption) are trivalent:

$$
  \#\!Verts_{ext} = 0
  \;\;\Rightarrow\;\;
  \big(
     deg(\Gamma) = 0
     \;\;\Leftrightarrow\;\;
     \text{all vertices are trivalent}
  \big)
  \,.
$$

The following is the smallest example of such a trivalent graph:

<center>
<img src="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/TheDegreeZeroGraph.jpg" width="240">
</center>

Hence in general, the degree of a trivalent graph is three times its number of external vertices:

$$
  \Gamma 
  \;
  \text{trivalent}
  \;\;\;\Rightarrow \;\;\;
  deg\big( [\Gamma] \big)
  \;=\;
  3 \cdot \#\!Verts_{ext}
  \,.
$$

(Because such a graph is the result of taking a trivalent graph in degree 0 and replacing internal vertices of degree -3 with external vertices of degree 0.)

For example, the following graph, obtained from the above trivalent graph by replacing the three internal vertices labeled 1,2 and 3 with external vertices, is of degree $3 \cdot 3 = 9$:

1. $e$ is not a [[tadpole]] (Example \ref{GraphsWithDirectLoopsVanish}):

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Since [[tadpole]] graphs are vanishing graphs by Def. \ref{VanishingGraphs}, we may assume that each edge in $\Gamma$ has two distint vertices it ends on, for otherwise we have the zero element in the graph complex.

Now, since each edge has degree 2 (according to Def. \ref{DegreeOfAGraph}), we may think of each edge as contribution a degree +1 for each of its two vertices, via the coresponding half-edge ending on that vertex.

Since external vertices have degree 0, together with the half-edges that end on them they contribute a non-negative number to the total degree.

While internal vertices have degree -3 (according to Def. \ref{DegreeOfAGraph}), we have a vanishing graph if less than three edges meet at an internal vertex (by Def. \ref{VanishingGraphs}) and hence, once vanishing graphs have been quotiented out, also internal vertices together with the half-edges ending on them contribute a non-negative number to the  total degree.

This proves the first claim. 

For the second claim, recall from Example \ref{TrivalenGraphs} that a graph has degree 0 precisely if it is a disjoint union of a) isolated external vertices and b) trivalent graphs all whose vertices are internal.

But if there is any disjoint non-empty sub-graph with only internal vertices, the total graph is again a vanishing graph by Def. \ref{VanishingGraphs}, since it contains internal vertices not connected to any external vertex.


<center>
<img src="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/VacuumDiagramVanishesInGraphComplex.jpg" width="610">

Hence the only non-vanishing graphs of degree 0 are those which have some isolated external vertices and nothing else.

For the case of $\Sigma = \mathbb{R}^D$ these were originally hinted at in [Kontsevich 93, Section 5](#Kontsevich93) and discussed in detail in [Cattaneo, Cotta-Ramusino, Longoni 02](#CattaneoCottaRamusinoLongoni02) [05](#CattaneoCottaRamusinoLongoni05), see also [Bar-Natan 91](#BarNatan91).

We state the definition of the graph complexes $KnotGraphs\big( \mathbb{R}^3\big)$ of _knot graphs_ (according to the [above](#IdeaGraphComplexModelForSpacesOfKnots)) associated with [[Euclidean space]] of [[dimension]] 3, following [Cattaneo, Cotta-Ramusino, Longoni 02](#CattaneoCottaRamusinoLongoni02) [05](#CattaneoCottaRamusinoLongoni05).

The definition is almost exactly the same as that of $\oplus_n Graphs_n\big( \mathbb{R}^3\big)$ [above](#GraphComplexForConfigurationsOfPointsInR3), except for the following two differences:

**1)** external vertices now carry degree -1, so that the formula (eq:DegreeOfAGraph) for the degree of a graph is changed to

\[
  \label{DegreeOfAKnoptGraph}
  deg\big( [\Gamma]\big) 
  \;=\;
  (D-1) \cdot \#\!Edges 
  \;
  - D \cdot \#\!Vertices_{int}

  - 1 \cdot \#\!Vertices_{ext}
  \,,
\]

([CCRL 02, (4.6)](#CattaneoCottaRamusinoLongoni02), [Volić 13, Def. 4.3](#Volic13))

**2)** There is implicit a contractible edge from the $k$th to the $(k+1)$st external vertex (an _arc_), in that the definition of the differential (Def. \ref{DifferentialOnGraphs}) regards these as contractible edges.

([CCRL 02, 4.2](#CattaneoCottaRamusinoLongoni02), [Volić 13, p. 35](#Volic13))

The differential in $KnotGraphs(\mathbb{R}^3)$ of the single trivalent internal vertext is a variant of that in $Graphs_3\big(\mathbb{R}^3\big)$ (Example \ref{ThreeTermRelation}) and that in $Graphs_0\big( \mathbb{R}^3\big)$ (Example \ref{DifferentialOfMinimalTrivalenVacuumGraph}):

Notice how the edges parallel to the outer dashed arcs do not make the graphs in the first line vanish, but the [[parallel edges]] appearing in the second line make vanishing graphs (Def. \ref{VanishingGraphs}).

In contrast, the differential of the diagram in $KnotGraphs(\mathbb{R}^3)$ consisting of just two overlapping chords gets contributions only from contraction of the four arcs:

### Cohomology of configuration spaces via Feynman diagrams
 {#RelationToConfigurationSpaces}

Reading the graphs as [[Chern-Simons theory]] [[Feynman diagrams]], hence as instructions for [[configuration space of points|configuration space]]-[[integrals]] of [[wedge products]] of [[Feynman propagators]] assigned to [[edges]] in a graph, with [[propagators regarded as differential forms on configuration spaces]],
yields a [[quasi-isomorphism]] from the graph complex to the [[real cohomology]] of [[configuration spaces of points]].

### Cohomology of knot space / higher Vassiliev invariants

The [[Feynman amplitudes]] of knot graphs (as [above](#KnotGraphsDefinition)) are  [[Vassiliev knot invariants]].

This was originally hinted at in [Kontsevich 93, Section 5](#Kontsevich93).
Details are in [Cattaneo, Cotta-Ramusino, Longoni 02](#CattaneoCottaRamusinoLongoni02).
Review is in [Volić 13, Section 4](#Volic13).

###### Proposition
**([[knot invariant]] from [[Chern-Simons theory]] [[Feynman amplitude]])**


The [[Feynman amplitude]] 
of the knot graph cocycle [[Feynman diagram]] from Example \ref{KnotGraphCocycleOfOrder2}, in [[Chern-Simons theory]] with a [[Wilson loop]] [[knot]], is a [[knot invariant]]:


<center>
<img src="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/FeynmanAmplitudeKnotInvariant.jpg" width="600">
</center>


=--


This is due to [Guadagnini-Martellini-Mintchev 89](#GuadagniniMartelliniMintchev89)
and [Bar-Natan91](#BarNatan91), recalled im [Volić 13, Theorem 3.3.5](#Volic13).

\linebreak


Various authors discuss [[Vassiliev invariants]] in terms of graphs subject to the "[[STU-relation]]"  

([Kontsevich 93, Figure 8](#Kontsevich93), [Bar-Natan 95, Figure 3](Vassiliev+invariant#BarNatan95)) and the "IHX-relation"  which it implies ([Bar-Natan 95, Theorem 6](Vassiliev+invariant#BarNatan95))

That these relations characterize the cohomology of the knot-graph complex in the respective degrees is shown in [Koytcheff-Munson-Volic 13, Section 3.4](#KoytcheffMunsonVolic13)
