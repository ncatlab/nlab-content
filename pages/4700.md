This entry will be (for now) both about graph homology and about graph cohomology, which were originally introduced by Maxim Kontsevich; 
once the material grows, it can be separated into two entries. Kontsevich produced few version of the graph complex, the basic one attached to the operad of 3-valent ribbon graphs. A graph complex can be produced from the [[Feynman transform]] of a modular operad.

## Graph homology

__Graph homology__ $H\mathcal{G}_{\bullet\bullet}$ is the cohomology of the graph complex $(\mathcal{G}_{\bullet\bullet}, \partial)$ which is the free $\mathbf{C}$-vector space generated by isomorphism classes of oriented [[ribbon graph]]s modulo relation $(\Gamma,-\sigma) = - (\Gamma, \sigma)$ where $\Gamma$ is a ribbon graph with orientation $\sigma$. The differential is given by

$$
\partial(\Gamma) := \sum_{e\in E(\Gamma)\backslash Loop(\Gamma)} \Gamma/e
$$

where the sum is over edges $e$ which are not loops and $\Gamma/e$ is obtained from $\Gamma$ by contraction at edge $e$ (cf. [[ribbon graph]]). The map $\partial$ is really a differential ($\partial^2 = 0$) because two contractions in different order produce a different orientation. There is a canonical bigrading on the graph complex, where $\mathcal{G}_{ij}$ is generated by those graphs which have $i$ vertices and $j$ edges; the differential has bidgree $(-1,-1)$; each $\mathcal{G}_{ij}$ is finite-dimensional, while the whole complex is infinte-dimensional. Graph splits into a direct sum of subcomplexes labelled by the Euler characteristics of the underlying graph. The structure of a graph complex reflects a structure in the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex of a certain Lie algebra; and the graph homology to the relative Lie homology of that Lie algebra as shown by Kontsevich.

## Applications

...moduli spaces

...deformation theory

...Rozansky-Witten theory

...Vassiliev invariants

...description of the classifying space $BOut(F_n)$ of the group of outer automorphisms of a free group with $n$ generators

Graph complex controls the universal $L_\infty$-deformations of the space of polyvector fields. 

## Generalizations

There are generalizations for $d$-algebras (algebras over little disc operad in higher dimension). The cohomological graph complex is then the case for $d=2$. There is also a "directed" version. On the other hand, graph complex
