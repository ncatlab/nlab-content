A **frame** $A$ is a [[partial order|poset]] with all [[join|joins]] and all finite [[meet|meets]] which satisfies the _infinite distributive law_:
$$ x \wedge (\bigvee_i y_i) \leq \bigvee_i (x\wedge y_i).$$
(Note that the converse holds in any case, so we have equality.)

A frame will automatically be a [[Heyting algebra]] by the [[adjoint functor theorem]], so you can think of a frame as a [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]] [[suplattice]], or a cartesian [[quantale]].  Note that frame homomorphisms are not required to preserve the Heyting implication.

An object of the [[opposite category]] to the category [[Frm]] of frames is a [[locale]], an alternative to a [[topological space]].  Conversely, any topological space has a frame of open subsets.  (In fact, one definition of a topological space is a set equipped with a subframe of its [[power set]].)
