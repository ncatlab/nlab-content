## Idea

The notion of _frame_ is a generalization of the notion of [[category of open subsets]] of a [[topological space]]. A _frame_ is like a category of open subsets in a space possibly more general than a topological space: a [[locale]]. This in turn is effectively defined to be anything that has a collection of open subsets that behaves essentially like the open subsets of a topological space do.

## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A **frame** $\mathcal{O}$ is 

* a [[partial order|poset]] 

* that has 

  * all small [[coproduct]]s, called [[join|joins]] $\bigvee$

  * all [[finite limit]]s, called [[meet|meets]] $\wedge$

* and which satisfies the _infinite distributive law_:

  $$ 
    x \wedge (\bigvee_i y_i) \leq \bigvee_i (x\wedge y_i)
  $$

  for all $x, \{y_i\}_i$ in $A$

  (Note that the converse holds in any case, so we have equality.)

A _frame homomorphism_ is a homomorphism of posets that preserves finite meets and arbitrary joins. Frames and frame homomorphisms form the category [[Frm]].

The formal duals of frames, hence the objects in the [[opposite category]] [[Locale]] $:=$ [[Frm]]${}^{op}$ are called [[locale]]s.

=--

The notation $\mathcal{O}$ to supposed to remind us that every frame is like a [[frame of opens]] of the corresponding [[locale]].

## Properties

A useful way to understand frames and [[locales]] is as the simplest nontrivial special cases of [[(n,1)-topos]]es. So we start in

* [As (0,1)-toposes](#As0Topos)

with some remarks on this, and only then turn to 

* [General properties](#GeneralProperties)

of frames, which should make more sense this way.

### As a $(0,1)$-topos
 {#As0Topos}

The notion of _frame_ -- or rather its formal dual, the notion of _[[locale]]_ -- is the special case of the notion of [[(n,1)-topos]]es for $n = 0$: [[(0,1)-topos]]es.

The axioms on a frame are nothing but [[Giraud's axioms]] on [[sheaf topos]]es, restricted to [[(0,1)-categories]]:

given the existence of finite limits and arbitrary colimits, the _infinite distributive law_ expresses that a frame has [[universal colimits]]: they are stable under [[pullback]]. (For notice that in a poset [[pullback]]s and [[product]]s coincide.)

Then a morphism of frames is precisely (the [[inverse image]] of) a [[geometric morphism]]: a morphism preserving finite limits and arbitrary colimits. 


### General
 {#GeneralProperties}

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

A frame is automatically a [[Heyting algebra]].  

=--

In [[category theory|category theoretic]] terms this means that it ia a [[cartesian closed category]], hence that

for every object $x \in \mathcal{O}$ the functor

$$
  x \wedge (-) : \mathcal{O} \to \mathcal{O}
$$

that forms the [[product]] with $x$ has a [[right adjoint]]

$$
  (-) \Rightarrow x : \mathcal{O} \to \mathcal{O}
$$

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


This exists by the [[adjoint functor theorem]], using that there is only a finite number of morphims between any two objects (one or none) and that finite limits exist in $\mathcal{O}$.

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Therefore one may think of a of a frame as a [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]] [[suplattice]], or a cartesian [[quantale]].  

But notice that the frame [[homomorphism]]s are not required to preserve the Heyting implication.

### As sites

A frame is naturally equipped with the structure of a [[site]]: 

a family of morphism $\{U_i \to U\}$ is [[covering]] precisely if $U$ is the [[union]] of the $U_i$

$$
  \bigvee_i U_i = U
  \,.
$$

For more on this see [[locale]].

## Formal duals: locales

The [[opposite category]] to the category [[Frm]] is the category [[Loc]] of [[locale]]s (possibly slightly generalized [[topological space]]s)

$$
  Loc := Frm^{op}
$$

Conversely, any [[topological space]] has a [[frame of opens|frame of open subsets]].  (In fact, one definition of a topological space is a set equipped with a subframe of its [[power set]].)

## Examples

* For $X$ a [[topological space]], the [[category of open subsets]] of $X$ is a frame: the [[frame of opens]].
