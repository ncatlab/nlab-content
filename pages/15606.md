## Idea

For $p$ a [[prime number]], then the _Fermat quotient_ of any [[integer]] $a$ is the quotient

$$
  \partial_p a \coloneqq
  \frac{a^p - a}{p}
$$

of the difference between the $p$th power of $a$ and $a$ itself by $p$. By [[Fermat's little theorem]] this is indeed an [[integer]], i.e. conversely one has for all $a\in \mathbb{Z}$ that

$$
  a^p = a + p (\partial_p a)
$$

for a uniquely defined integer $\partial_p a$.

(The $p$-power operation $(-)^p$ here is the one that restricts to the [[Frobenius homomorphism]] after [[p-localization]] and the one which is a shadow of the [[power operations]] in [[E-infinity arithmetic geometry]] ([Lurie, remark 2.2.7](#Lurie)).)

As the notation is meant to suggest, the Fermat quotient as a map $\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}$ from the (underlying set of the) [[ring]] of [[integers]] to itself is [[analogy|analogous]] to a [[derivation]]. It is not quite an ordinary derivation, but satisfies conditions of what has been called a __$p$-derivation.

In view of this, in the context of [[arithmetic differential equations]] the Fermat quotient is interpreted as an analog in [[arithmetic geometry]] of actual [[derivations]] in [[algebraic geometry]]/[[complex analytic geometry]]. For more on this see also at _[[Borger's absolute geometry]]_ the section _[Motivation](Borger's%20absolute%20geometry#Motivation)_.
