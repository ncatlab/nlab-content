The commonly accepted standard [[foundation of mathematics]] today is a material [[set theory]], $\mathbf{ZFC}$ or Zermelo--Frankel set theory with the [[axiom of choice]].


## History

The first version was developed by [[Ernst Zermelo]] in 1908; in 1922, [[Abraham Fraenkel]] and [[Thoralf Skolem]] independently proposed a precise first-order version with the [[axiom of replacement]]; finally, Zermelo added the [[axiom of foundation]] in 1930.  All of these versions included the axiom of choice, but this was considered controversial for some time; one has merely $\mathbf{ZF}$ if it is taken out.

$\mathbf{ZFC}$ is similar to the [[class]] theories $\mathbf{NBG}$ (due to [[John von Neumann]], [[Paul Bernays]], and [[Kurt GÃ¶del]]) and $\mathbf{MK}$ (due to [[Anthony Morse]] and [[John Kelley]]) are similar; the former is a conservative, finitely axiomatisable extension, while the latter is stronger, equivalent to postulating an [[inaccessible cardinal]].

Contemporary set theorists often accept additional [[large cardinal]] axioms.  There are also weak versions, especially for [[constructive mathematics|constructive]] and [[predicative mathematics|predicative]] mathematics.  Then there are alternatives on a different basis, notably $\mathbf{NFU}$ (a very impredicative material set theory) and **[[ETCS]]** (a [[structural set theory]]).
