## Idea

A __vector field__ is a [[section]] of a [[vector bundle]].

More specifically, a vector field is a _[[tangent vector field]]_ which is a [[section]] of a [[tangent bundle]]. Hence this is a function which picks a [[tangent vector]] at each point of a manifold, such that this assignment is suitably [[differentiable function|differentiable]].

Equivalently this is a rank $(1,0)$-[[tensor field]] on $X$

Vector fields can be defined as [[derivations]]
of the algebra of functions.
See the article [[derivations of smooth functions are vector fields]].
