## Definition

Let $\mathbf{k}$ be a [[field]] of [[characteristic]] 0 and $\lambda \in \mathbf{k}^*$. A **$\lambda$-Drinfeld associator**, or just **$\lambda$-associator**, is a [[grouplike element]] $\Phi(a,b)$ of the $\mathbf{k}$-[[associative algebra|algebra]] of [[formal power series]] in two non-commuting [[variables]] $a,b$ satisfying:

1. The pentagon equation 
$$
\Phi(t_{12} , t_{23} + t_{24} )\Phi(t_{13} + t_{23} , t_{34} ) = \Phi(t_{23} , t_{34} )\Phi(t_{12} + t_{13} , t_{24} + t_{34} )\Phi(t_{12} , t_{23} )
$$
in $\widehat{U(L_4)}$
2. the hexagon equation 
$$
\exp(\lambda a/2)\Phi(c,a)\exp(\lambda c/2)\Phi(b,c)\exp(\lambda b/2)\Phi(a,b)=1
$$

where $L_4$ is the fourth [[Drinfeld-Kohno Lie algebra]] and $c=-a-b$.

###### Remark

The set of "0-associators" is the what is called the _[[Grothendieck-Teichmueller group]]_. This acts freely on the set of Drinfeld associators.

## Relations with braided monoidal categories

These [[equations]] are modelled on the defining [[axioms]] of [[braided monoidal categories]]. Indeed, associators provides a universal way of constructing braided monoidal categories out of some [[Lie algebra|Lie algebraic]] data.

Drinfeld associators are also used to construct [[quasi Hopf algebras]].

###### Theorem

Let $(\mathfrak{g},t)$ be a metrizable [[Lie algebra]], that is a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ together with a non-degenerate symmetric $\mathfrak{g}$-invariant 2-tensor $t$. Then if $\Phi$ is a $\lambda$-associator and $\hbar$ a formal variable, then the action of 
$$
\Phi(\hbar (t \otimes 1),\hbar (1\otimes t)) \in U(\mathfrak{g})^{\otimes 3}[[\hbar]]
$$
 and $e^{\hbar \lambda t/2}\circ P$ turns the category of $U(\mathfrak{g} ) [ [ \hbar ] ] $ module into a braided monoidal category, where $P$ is the flip: $P(a\otimes b)=b\otimes a$.

###### Remark

Examples of metrizable Lie algebras are provided by [[simple Lie algebras]], in which case $t$ is a scalar mutliple of the [[Killing form]]. The braided monoidal category obtained this way is equivalent to that constructed from the corresponding [[quantum group]], by the [[Drinfeld-Kohno theorem]].

##Existence##
An explicit associator over $\mathbf{C}$ was constructed by [[Drinfeld]] from the [[monodromy]] of a universal version of the [[Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation]]. Using the non-emptiness of the set of associators, and the fact that is is a [[torsor]] under the [[action]] of the 
[[Grothendieck-Teichmueller group]], he show that associators over $\mathbf{Q}$ also exists.

##Applications##
* [[Drinfeld-Kohno theorem]]
* [[Etingof-Kazhdan quantization functor]]
* [[Formality]] of the [[little 2-disk operad]]
* Construction of a functorial [[universal finite type invariant]].
