Let $\mathbf{k}$ be a field of characteristic 0 and $\lambda \in \mathbf{k}^*$. A $\lambda$-Drinfeld associator, or just $\lambda$-associator, is a [[grouplike element]] $\Phi(a,b)$ of the $\mathbf{k}$-algebra of formal power series in two non-commuting variables $a,b$ satisfying:

1. The pentagon equation 
$$
\Phi(t_{12} , t_{23} + t_{24} )\Phi(t_{13} + t_{23} , t_{34} ) = \Phi(t_{23} , t_{34} )\Phi(t_{12} + t_{13} , t_{24} + t_{34} )\Phi(t_{12} , t_{23} )
$$
in $\widehat{U(L_4)}$
2. the hexagon equation 
$$
\exp(\lambda a/2)\Phi(c,a)\exp(\lambda c/2)\Phi(b,c)\exp(\lambda b/2)\Phi(a,b)=1
$$

where $L_4$ is the fourth [[Drinfeld-Kohno Lie algebra]] and $c=-a-b$.


These equations are modelled on the defining axioms of [[braided monoidal categories]]. Indeed, associators provides a universal way of constructing braided monoidal categories out of some Lie algebraic data.

**Remark**: The set of "0-associators" is the so-called [[Grothendieck-Teichmueller]] group.


##Existence##
An explicit associator over $\mathbf{C}$ was constructed by Drinfeld from the monodromy of a universal version of the [[Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation]]. Using the non-emptiness of the set of associators, and the fact that is is a [[torsor]] under the action of the Grothendieck-Teichmueller group, he show that associators over $\mathbf{Q}$ also exists.

##Applications##
* [[Drinfeld-Kohno theorem]]
* [[Etingof-Kazhdan quantization functor]]
* [[Formality]] of the [[little 2-disk operad]]
* Construction of a functorial [[universal finite type invariant]].
