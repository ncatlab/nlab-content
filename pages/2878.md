## Idea

The fpqc topology is a [[Grothendieck topology]] on the category of (commutative) [[affine scheme]]s.  It is one of the main [[Grothendieck topologies]] used in [[algebraic geometry]]. 

## Definition

Let $Aff$ be the category [[opposite category|opposite]] to the category of [[commutative algebra]]s. A family of maps $\{f_i : U_i\to X\}_{i\in I}$ in that category is a cover in the __fpqc topology__ if the union of images cover $X$ as a [[topological space]] and all morphisms $f_i$ are [[faithfully flat morphism|faithfully]] [[flat morphism|flat]] and [[quasicompact morphism|quasicompact]]. The French for this is *fid&egrave;lement plat et quasicompact* (fpqc).
