## Idea

Dependent linear type theory is the combination of _[[dependent type theory]]_ and _[[linear type theory]]_, hence a [[type theory]] where linear types may be dependent on ordinary intuitionistic types. An extension of the [[LF]] [[syntax]] by dependent linear types appears in ([Pfenning 96](#Pfenning96), [WCFW 03](#WCFW03)) and a dependent linear extension of [[system L]] in ([Spiwack 14, section 5](#Spiwack14)). What should be the [[categorical semantics]] of dependent linear type theory was discussed in ([Shulman 08](#Shulman08), [Ponto-Shulman 12](#PontoShulman12), [Shulman 12](#Shulman12), [Schreiber 14](#Schreiber14)). Proposal for an actual [[syntax]] for dependent linear type theory appears in ([Vákár 14](#Vakar14), [KPB 15](#KPB15)).


 
Following the notion of [[hyperdoctrine]] this should mean, in terms of [[categorical semantics]], that dependent linear type theory is for each [[context]] $\Gamma$ a [[linear type theory]]/possibly-non-[[cartesian monoidal category|cartesian]] [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]] [[closed monoidal category]] $(\mathcal{C}_{\Gamma}, \otimes, 1)$ and for each [[homomorphism]] of [[contexts]] $f \;\colon\; \Gamma_1 \longrightarrow \Gamma_2$ functorially an [[adjoint triple]] of [[functors]]

$$
  (f_! \dashv f^\ast \dashv f_\ast) 
    \;\colon\; 
   \mathcal{C}_{\Gamma_1}
    \stackrel{\stackrel{f_!}{\longrightarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{f^\ast}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{f_\ast}{\leftarrow}}}
    \mathcal{C}_{\Gamma_2}
  \,.
$$

where $f^\ast$ is [[context extension]] and where the [[left adjoint]] $f_!$ and [[right adjoint]] $f_\ast$ are to be thought of as linear analogs of [[dependent sum]] and [[dependent product]], respectively. Moreover this should satisfy [[Frobenius reciprocity]], hence $f^\ast$ should be a strong [[closed monoidal functor]]. 

Equivalently this is an [[indexed closed monoidal category]].

Typically one would in addition demand the [[Beck-Chevalley condition]] for consecutive such adjoint triples.

In [[geometry]]/[[topos theory]] such a "linear hyperdoctrine" is known as _[[six operations]] yoga in [[Wirthmüller context|Wirtmüller flavor]]_. In fact there this appears in [[geometric homotopy theory]] ("[[derived functors]] on [[quasicoherent sheaves]]") hence as _dependent linear [[homotopy type theory]]_.

## Semantic definition

We define here the [[categorical semantics]] that linear homotopy type theory is supposed to have. So its [[syntax|syntactic]] definition is to be such that at least all of the following constitute [[models]] for the theory. In order to indicate the semantic level we will try to keep a hyphen  in "linear homotopy-type theory".

### Dependent linear type theory
 {#DependentLinearTypeTheory}

Notice that the following relation between syntax and semantics are well established (see at _[[relation between type theory and category theory]]_ for details):

|  [[syntax]] | [[semantics]] |
|-------------|---------------|
| [[linear type theory|multiplicative intuitionistic linear type theory]] | ([[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]] [[closed monoidal category|closed]]) [[monoidal categories]] |
| [[dependent type theory]] | [[locally cartesian closed categories]] |

Here the correspondence in the first line works by interpreting [[types]] $X$ in the [[linear type theory]] as [[objects]] $[X]$ in a [[monoidal category]] $\mathcal{C}^{\otimes}$ and by interpreting the [[conjunctions]] (as far as they exist) as follows:

| [[type theory]] | [[category theory]] |
|------|--------|
| $\otimes$ [[multiplicative conjunction]] | $\otimes$ [[tensor product]] |
| $\multimap$ [[linear implication]]   | $[-,-]$ [[internal hom]] |
| $(-)^\bot$ [[linear negation]] | $(-)^\ast$ [[dual object]]

The correspondence in the second line works by forming for any [[locally cartesian closed category]] $\mathcal{C}$ its system of [[slice categories]] $[\Gamma] \mapsto \mathcal{C}_{/[\Gamma]}$, each of which is a [[cartesian monoidal category|cartesian]] [[closed monoidal category]], and then interpreting that as the [[semantics]] for [[dependent type theory]] in the [[context]] $\Gamma$:

$$
  \left\{
    \Gamma \vdash a \colon A 
  \right\}
  \leftrightarrow
  \left\{
     (\ast \stackrel{[a]}{\longrightarrow} [A])
     \in Mor(\mathcal{C}_{/[\Gamma]})
  \right\}
  \,.
$$

Moreover, the system of slice categories has good [[base change]] in that for every morphism $[f] \colon [\Gamma_1]\to [\Gamma_2]$ in $\mathcal{C}$ there is an [[adjoint triple]] of [[functors]]

$$ 
   \mathcal{C}_{[\Gamma_1]}
    \stackrel{\stackrel{[f]_!}{\longrightarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{[f]^\ast}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{[f]_\ast}{\leftarrow}}}
    \mathcal{C}_{[\Gamma_2]}
$$

satisfying [[Frobenius reciprocity]]. These serve as the semantics for the the [[context extension]] along a map $f\colon \Gamma_1 \to \Gamma_2$ of contexts, and for the [[dependent sum]] $\sum$, and the [[dependent product]] of the dependent type theory syntax, respectively:

$$
  \left\{
     \underset{f^{-1}(-)}{\sum}
     , \; f \;,
     \underset{f^{-1}(-)}{\prod}
  \right\}
  \leftrightarrow
  \left\{
    [f]_! \dashv [f]^\ast \dashv [f]_\ast  
  \right\}
  \,.
$$


Now since a [[cartesian monoidal category]] is in particular a ([[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]] [[closed monoidal category|closed]]) [[monoidal category]], this immediately suggest to generalize the assignments
$[\Gamma] \mapsto (\mathcal{C}_{/[\Gamma]})^\times$ to assignments
$[\Gamma] \mapsto (\mathcal{C}_{[\Gamma]})^\otimes$ of ([[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]] [[closed monoidal category|closed]]) [[monoidal categories]] (possibly but not necessarily the [[slice categories]] of $\mathcal{C}$) such that there still is good [[base change]] in the above way. The resulting structure may be called a _symmetric closed [[indexed monoidal category]]_.

So any $\mathcal{C}_{[\Gamma]}$ here is a ([[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]], [[closed monoidal category|closed]]) [[monoidal category]] and hence is [[categorical semantics]] for [[linear types]], while at the same times these types depend on the "non-linear" type $[\Gamma]$. In this way the system ("[[hyperdoctrine]]") $[\Gamma] \mapsto (\mathcal{C}_{[\Gamma]})^\otimes$ is semantics a _dependent linear type theory_.

The [[syntax]] of which such "[[hyperdoctrines]] of [[symmetric monoidal categories]]" are the semantics should be called _dependent linear type theory_. This is fairly straightforward. Details are written out in ([Vakar 14](#Vakar14)).

+-- {: .num_defn #SemanticsForDependentLinearTypeTheory}
###### Definition

A _semantics for (symmetric, closed) dependent linear type theory_ is

1. a [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$ with [[finite limits]];

1. a [[functor]] $Mod \colon \mathcal{C}^{op} \to MonCat$ from its [[opposite category]] to [[monoidal categories]];

such that 

1. each $Mod(X)^\otimes$ is [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]] [[closed monoidal category|closed]]  (with [[internal hom]] to be denoted $[-,-]$);

1. for each $[f] \colon [\Gamma_1] \to [\Gamma_2]$ in $Mor(\mathcal{C})$ the assigned [[functor]] $f^\ast \colon Mod([\Gamma_2]) \to Mod([\Gamma_1])$ has a [[left adjoint]] $f_!$ and a [[right adjoint]] $f_\ast$;

1. $f_!$ satsifies [[Frobenius reciprocity]].

If in addition the [[Beck-Chevalley condition]] is satisfied by $(f_1\dashv f^\ast)$, then we speak of _linear homotopy-type theory with Beck-Chevalley condition_.

=--

Under the [[Grothendieck construction]] this is equivalently an [[indexed closed monoidal category]] as considered in ([Ponto-Shulman 12](#PontoShulman12)).

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

Def. \ref{SemanticsForDependentLinearTypeTheory} describes linear types depending on non-linear types. More generally one could also consider linear types depending on linear types. Where [[tangent (∞,1)-toposes]] are the archetypicals models for linear types depending on non-linear types (this we consider [below](#ParameterizedModuleSpectra)) the archetypical model for linear types depending on other linear types might be higher [[jet (∞,1)-category|jet (∞,1)-topos]]. This remains to be thought about.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

That $f^\ast$ is a morphism of [[monoidal categories]] means that it is a [[strong monoidal functor]], preserving the [[tensor product]]

$$
  f^\ast(X\otimes Y)\simeq (f^\ast X)\otimes (f^\ast Y)
  \,.
$$

If monoidal categories involved are [[closed monoidal categories]] then the condition of [[Frobenius reciprocity]] is equivalent to $f^\ast$ also being a [[strong closed functor]] in that it preserves the [[internal hom]]

$$
  f^\ast [X,Y] \simeq [f^\ast X, f^\ast Y]
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark


Semantics for linear dependent type theory, def. \ref{SemanticsForDependentLinearTypeTheory}, is hence a natural system of six functors

$$
  (f_! \dashv f^\ast),\; (f^\ast \dashv f_\ast),\; (\otimes \dashv [-,-])
$$

satisfying some compatibility conditions. This is precisely Grothendieck's _[[yoga of six functors]]_ for the special case that the right adjoint of $f_!$ coincides with the left adjoint of $f_\ast$. This special case is also known as the _[[Wirthmüller context]]_ version of the yoga of six functors.


=--


+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition (Notation)

In view of the perspective of semantics for type theory, we will omit in the following the notational distinction between contexts and the objects that interpret them, and between dependent sum/product and the functors that interpret them. We will write the [[base change]] as

$$
   \left(
     \underset{f}{\sum}
     \dashv 
     f^\ast
     \dashv
     \underset{f}{\prod}
   \right)  
    \;\colon\; 
   Mod(\Gamma_1)
    \stackrel{\stackrel{f_!}{\longrightarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{f^\ast}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{f_\ast}{\leftarrow}}}
    Mod(\Gamma_2)
  \,.
$$

The statement of [[Frobenius reciprocity]] then equivalently reads like this:

$$
  \underset{f}{\sum}
  \left(
    X \otimes f^\ast Y
  \right)
  \simeq
  \left(
    \underset{f}{\sum} X 
  \right)
  \otimes 
  Y
  \,.
$$

For $f\colon X\to Y$ a morphism in $\mathcal{C}$, we write

$$
  \epsilon_f
  \colon
  \underset{f}{\sum}f^\ast (-)
  \longrightarrow
  (-)
$$

for the [[counit of an adjunction|adjunction counit]] of $(\sum_f \dashv f^\ast)$.

Notice that $\underset{f}{\sum}$ has the interpretation of summing over all the [[fibers]] of the morphism $f$, as the elements in its [[codomain]] vary. Therefore it is sometime suggestive to use the notation

$$
  \underset{f^{-1}(-)}{\sum}
  \coloneqq
  \underset{f}{\sum}
  \,.
$$

In this vein, for $X \in \mathcal{C}$ any object and $p_X \colon X \to \ast$ the canonical morphism to the [[terminal object]], we abbreviate as

$$
  \underset{X}{\sum}
  \coloneqq
  \underset{p_X}{\sum}
  \,.
$$

### Linear homotopy type theory
 {#LinearHomotopyTypeTheory}


This discussion of dependent linear type theory [above](#DependentLinearTypeTheory) has an evident straightforward refinement to [[homotopy theory]]. To appreciate this, notice that the following relation is well established (see again at _[[relation between type theory and category theory]]_ for details):


|  [[syntax]] | [[semantics]] |
|-------------|---------------|
| [[homotopy type theory]]  | [[locally cartesian closed (∞,1)-categories]] |
| [[homotopy type theory]] with [[univalence|univalent]] weak [[type universes]] | [[(∞,1)-toposes]] |

This works very much along the lines of the above relation between [[dependent type theory]] and [[locally cartesian closed categories]]. The central new ingredient is that one requires the locally cartesian closed category $\mathcal{C}$ to be equipped with a suitable structure of a [[model category]]. Using this there is then a notation of [[fibrant replacement]] of morphisms. The key point is that where in [[extensional type theory]] the [[identity type]] $(X \vdash Id_X \colon Type)$ of a type $X$ has semantics given by the [[diagonal]] morphism $\Delta_{[X]} \in \mathcal{C}_{/{[X]}}$, here in [[homotopy type theory]] it has semantics in the [[fibrant replacement]] $\hat \Delta_{[X]} \in \mathcal{C}_{/X}$. Such a fibrant replacement of the diagonal is [[path space object]] of $X$, reflecting the [[equivalences]]/[[homotopies]] "inside" the type $X$.

Taking all this together, we set:

+-- {: .num_defn #SemanticsForLinearHomotopyTypeTheory}
###### Definition

A _semantics for linear homotopy type theory_ is

1. an [[(∞,1)-category]] $\mathcal{C}$ with [[finite (∞,1)-limits]];

1. an [[(∞,1)-functor]] $Mod \colon \mathcal{C}^{op} \to MonCat_\infty$ to [[monoidal (∞,1)-categories]];


such that 

1. each $Mod(X)$ is [[symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category|symmetric]] closed (with [[internal hom]] to be denoted $[-,-]$); 

1. for each $[f] \colon [\Gamma_1] \to [\Gamma_2]$ in $Mor(\mathcal{C})$ the assigned [[(∞,1)-functor]] $f^\ast \colon Mod([\Gamma_2]) \to Mod([\Gamma_1])$ has a [[left adjoint]] $f_!$ and a [[right adjoint]] $f_\ast$;

1. $f_!$ satsifies [[Frobenius reciprocity]].

If in addition the [[Beck-Chevalley condition]] is satisfied by $(f_1\dashv f^\ast)$, then we speak of _linear homotopy-type theory with Beck-Chevalley condition_.

=--

For brevity we will omit in the following the notational distinction between contexts and the objects that interpret them, and between dependent sum/product and the functors that interpret them. We will write the [[base change]] as

$$
   \left(
     \underset{f}{\sum}
     \dashv 
     f^\ast
     \dashv
     \underset{f}{\prod}
   \right)  
    \;\colon\; 
   Mod(\Gamma_1)
    \stackrel{\stackrel{f_!}{\longrightarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{f^\ast}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{f_\ast}{\leftarrow}}}
    Mod(\Gamma_2)
  \,.
$$

The statement of [[Frobenius reciprocity]] then is that 

$$
  \underset{f}{\sum}
  \left(
    X \otimes f^\ast Y
  \right)
  \simeq
  \left(
    \underset{f}{\sum} X 
  \right)
  \otimes 
  Y
  \,.
$$



## Examples / Models

We consider here examples of semantics for [dependent linear type theory](#DependentLinearTypeTheory) and for [linear homtopy type theory](#LinearHomotopyTypeTheory). For each example we also spell out some of the abtract constructions (discussed in _[Structures in linear homotopy type theory](#StructuresInLinearHomotopyTypeTheory))_ realized in that model.

### Slices of a topos

The following example is trivial and not the kind of example of genuine interest, but it may be instructive to start with this example anyway.

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

For $\mathbf{H}$ a [[topos]], then its system $\mathbf{H}_{/(-)} \colon \mathbf{H}^{op} \to CartMonCat \to MonCat$ of [[slice toposes]] is semantics for dependent linear type theory, def. \ref{SemanticsForDependentLinearTypeTheory}.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

This example for dependent linear type theory is extremely "non-linear".  
One way to characterize this is to observe that this dependent linear type theory has almost no [[dualizable object|dualizable]] linear types. The only one is the terminal object in each slice. Given that the above formulas notably for secondary integral transforms (def.\ref{SIT}) assume dualizable objects, this means that in this non-linear context there will be no nontrivial secondary integral transforms.

=--

Accordingly we now pass gradually to more and more linear examples that are more and more interesting as far as linear type theory goes.

### Parameterized pointed objects
 {#PointedObjects}

A first step away from the Cartesian example [above](#CartesianWirthmuellerContexts) towards more genuinely linear types is the following.

+-- {: .num_defn #PointedObjectsInSlice}
###### Definition

Let $\mathbf{H}$ be a [[topos]]. For $X \in \mathbf{H}$ any [[object]], write 

$$
  \mathcal{C}_X \coloneqq \mathbf{H}_{/X}^{X/}
$$

for the [[category of pointed objects]] in the [[slice topos]] $\mathbf{H}_{/X}$. Equipped with the [[smash product]] $\wedge_X$ this is a [[closed monoidal category|closed]] [[symmetric monoidal category]] $(\mathcal{C}_X, \wedge_X, X \coprod X)$.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

For $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ any [[morphism]] in $\mathbf{H}$, the [[base change]] [[inverse image]] $f^\ast$ restricts to a functor $f^\ast \colon \mathcal{C}_Y \longrightarrow \mathcal{C}_X$ and this makes

$$
  \mathbf{H}_{/(-)}^{(-)/}
  \;\colon\;
  \mathbf{H}^{op}
  \longrightarrow
  MonCat
$$

semantics for dependent linear type theory in the sense of def. \ref{SemanticsForDependentLinearTypeTheory}.

=--

This appears as ([Shulman 08, examples 12.13 and 13.7](#Shulman08)) and ([Shulman 12, example 2.33](#Shulman12)).

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

For $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ any [[morphism]] in $\mathbf{H}$ then the [[base change]] [[inverse image]] $f^\ast \colon \mathbf{H}_{/Y} \longrightarrow \mathbf{H}_{/X}$ preserves pointedness, and the [[pushout]] functor $f_! \colon \mathbf{H}^{X/} \longrightarrow \mathbf{H}^{Y/}$ preserves co-pointedness. These two functors hence form an [[adjoint pair]]
$(f_! \dashv f^\ast) \colon \mathcal{C}_X \longrightarrow \mathcal{C}_Y$.
Moreover, since [[colimits]] in the under-over category $\mathbf{H}_{/X}^{X/}$ are computed as colimits in $\mathbf{H}$ of [[diagrams]] with an [[initial object]] adjoined, and since by the [[Giraud axioms]] in the [[topos]] $\mathbf{H}$ [[pullback]] preserves these colimits, it follows that $f^\ast \colon \mathcal{C}_Y \to \mathcal{C}_X$ preserves colimits. 
Finally by the discussion at _[[category of pointed objects]]_ we have that $\mathcal{C}_X$ and $\mathcal{C}_Y$ are [[locally presentable categories]], so that by the [[adjoint functor theorem]] it follows that $f^\ast$ has also a [[right adjoint]] $f_\ast \colon \mathcal{C}_X \to \mathcal{C}_Y$.

To see that $f^\ast$ is a [[strong monoidal functor]] observe that the [[smash product]] is, by the discussion there, given by a [[pushout]] over [[coproducts]] and [[products]] in the [[slice topos]]. As above these are all preserved by [[pullback]]. Finally to see that $f^\ast$ is also a [[strong closed functor]] observe that the [[internal hom]] on [[pointed objects]] is, by the discussion there, a [[fiber product]] of cartesian internal homs. These are preserved by [the above case](#CartesianWirthmuellerContexts), and the fiber product is preserved since $f^\ast$ preserves all limits. Hence $f^\ast$ preserves also the internal homs of pointed objects.

### Parameterized modules
 {#ParameterizedModules}

The examples of genuinely linear objects in the sense of [[linear algebra]] are the following.

+-- {: .num_prop #DependentLinearTypeTheoryOfModuleBundles}
###### Proposition

Let $E$ be a [[commutative ring]]. Write $E Mod$ for its [[category of modules]]. For $X\in $ [[Set]] write

$$
  E Mod(X) \coloneqq Func(X, E Mod) \simeq (E Mod)^{\times_{\vert X \vert}}
$$

for the [[functor category]] from $X$ (regarded as a [[category]]) to $E Mod$, hence for the [[bundles]] of $E$-[[modules]] over the [[discrete space]] $X$. Equipped with the [[tensor product of modules]] this is a [[symmetric monoidal category]] $E Mod^{\otimes}$. This construction yields a [[functor]]

$$
  E Mod \;\colon\; Set^{op} \longrightarrow SymMonCat
  \,.
$$

This is semantics for dependent linear type theory in the above sense.

=--

+-- {: .num_example #MatrixAsIntegralKernel}
###### Example

In the context of prop. \ref{DependentLinearTypeTheoryOfModuleBundles}
consider $E = k$ a [[field]]. Then $k Mod \simeq Vect_k$ is the [[category]] [[Vect]] of $k$-[[vector spaces]].

For $X \in Set$ a set, an $X$-dependent linear type $A \in Mod(X)\simeq Vect_k(X)$ is just a collection of ${\vert X\vert}$ vector spaces $A_x$ for $x\in X$.

For $X \in FinSet \hookrightarrow Set$ a [[finite set]], the [[dependent sum]] and [[dependent product]] operations coincide and produce the [[direct sum]] of vector spaces:

$$
  \underset{X}{\sum} A \simeq \underset{X}{\prod} A \simeq
  \underset{x\in X}{\oplus} A_x
  \in Vect_k(\ast)
  \,.
$$

Under this identification every morphism $f \in Mor(Set)$ with finite fibers carries a canonical untwisted fiberwise fundamental class, def.\ref{FiberwiseFundamentalClass}, $[f]_{canonical}$.

For 

$$
  \array{
    && X_1 \times X_2
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{p_1}}\swarrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{p_2}}
    \\
    X_1 && && X_2
  }
$$

a product corrrespondence of [[finite sets]], then an [[integral kernel]] $K$ on this, according to def. \ref{IntegralKernel}, with $A_i = 1_{X_i}$, is equivalently an ${\vert X_1\vert}\times {\vert X_2\vert}$-array of elements in $k$, hence a [[matrix]] $K_{\bullet,\bullet}$.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

Given a correspondence with integral kernel as in example \ref{MatrixAsIntegralKernel}, then the induced secondary integral transform according to def. \ref{SIT} is the [[linear function]] 

$$
  k^{\vert X_1\vert}
  \longleftarrow
  k^{\vert X_2\vert}
$$

represented by that matrix.

### Parametrized module spectra
 {#ParameterizedModuleSpectra}

The example of parameterized modules [above](#ParameterizedModules) has an evident generalization from [[linear algebra]] to [[stable homotopy theory]] with [[abelian categories|abelian]] [[categories of modules]] refined to [[stable (∞,1)-categories|stable]] [[(∞,1)-categories of ∞-modules]]. Despite of what this [[higher category theory]]-terminology might make the reader feel, this refinement flows naturally along the same lines as the 1-categorical situation. One may view the axiomatics of linear dependent homotopy type theory as neatly characterizing precisely this intimate similarity.

| [[linear algebra]] | [[brave new algebra]] |
|--------------------|-----------------------|
| [[abelian group]]  | [[spectrum]] |
| [[commutative ring]] | [[E-∞ ring|E-∞]] [[ring spectrum]] |
| [[module]] | [[∞-module]] spectrum |
| [[abelian category|abelian]] [[category of modules]] | [[stable (∞,1)-category|stable]] [[(∞,1)-category of ∞-modules]] |

+-- {: .num_prop #ParameterizedModuleSpectra}
###### Proposition

Let $E$ be an [[E-∞ ring]] spectrum and write $E Mod$ for its [[(∞,1)-category of ∞-modules]]. For $X \in $ [[∞Grpd]] write

$$
  E Mod(X) \coloneqq Func(X,E Mod)
$$

for the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-functors]] from $X$ (regarded as an [[(∞,1)-category]]) to $E Mod$, hence for the [[parameterized spectra]] over $X$ with $E$-[[∞-module]] structure. Equipped with the [[smash product of spectra]] this is a [[symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category]] $E Mod^\otimes$ This construction yields an [[(∞,1)-functor]]

$$
  E Mod \;\colon\; \infty Grpd^{op} \longrightarrow SymMonCat_\infty
$$

This is semantics for linear homotopy type theory in the sense of def. \ref{SemanticsForLinearHomotopyTypeTheory}. It also satisfies the [[Beck-Chevalley condition]].

=--

([Hopkins-Lurie](#HopkinsLurie), [Schreiber 14](#Schreiber14))

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

In the case that $E = \mathbb{S}$ is the [[sphere spectrum]], then $\mathbb{S}Mod \simeq Spectra$ is just the plain [[(∞,1)-category of spectra]] and then the above is the theory of plain [[parameterized spectra]].

In this case the corresponding [[indexed closed monoidal category]] (under the [[(∞,1)-Grothendieck construction]]) is the [[tangent (∞,1)-topos]] $T(\infty Grpd)$ of [[∞Grpd]]. This happens to be itself an [[(∞,1)-topos]] and as such is semantics for plain [[homotopy type theory]]. However, plain homotopy type theory only sees in a [[tangent (∞,1)-topos]] parameterized spectra depending on parameterized spectra. It takes the extra axioms of linear homotopy type theory to speak bout how the parameterization of the spectra itself depends on the base homotopy types.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The $\Sigma$-functor, def.\ref{Sigma}, in the model of parameterized $E$-module spectra, prop. \ref{ParameterizedModuleSpectra}, is the [[suspension spectrum]] construction $\Sigma^\infty$ followed by [[smash product]] of spectra with $E$:

$$
  \Sigma(X) \simeq \Sigma^\infty(X)\wedge E
  \,.
$$

This is the $E$-[[generalized homology]]-spectrum of the [[∞-groupoid]] $X$.

This construction does have a [[right adjoint]] $\Omega^\infty$, where $(\Sigma^\infty \dashv \Omega^\infty)$ is the $E$-[[stabilization]]-adjunction for [[∞Grpd]]. Hence [[parameterized spectra]] form a model of linear homotopy type theory that has an [[exponential modality]], def. \ref{SemanticsForExponentialModality}.

In the class of models of prop. \ref{ParameterizedModuleSpectra}, linear homotopy-type theory encodes the theory of [[twisted generalized cohomology]].

The construction in \ref{ParameterizedFormalModuliProblems} has the interpretation as  the category of generalized [[formal moduli problems]] parameterized over $X$.

### Quasicoherent sheaves of modules 
 {#ForQuasicoherentSheaves}

Pull-push of [[quasicoherent sheaves]] is usually discussed as a [[Grothendieck context]] of [[six operations]], but under some conditions it also becomes a [[Wirthmüller context]] and hence a model for dependent linear homotopy type theory.

Using results of Lurie this follows in the full generality of [[E-∞ geometry]] ([[spectral geometry]]).

Consider quasi-compact and quasi-separated [[E-∞ algebraic spaces]] ([[spectral algebraic spaces]]). (This includes precisely those [[spectral Deligne-Mumford stacks]] which have a [[scallop decomposition]], see [here](derived+Deligne-Mumford+stack#RelationToDerivedAlgebraicSpaces).)

If $f \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Y$ is a map between these which is

1. locally almost of finite presentation;

1. strongly proper;

1. has finite [[Tor-amplitude]]

then the left adjoint to pullback of [[quasicoherent sheaves]] exists

$$
  (f_! \dashv f^\ast)
    \;\colon\;
  QCoh(X)
    \stackrel{\overset{f_!}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{f^\ast}{\longleftarrow}}
  QCoh(Y)
  \,.
$$

([[Proper Morphisms, Completions, and the Grothendieck Existence Theorem|LurieProper, proposition 3.3.23]])

If $f$ is

* quasi-affine

then the right adjoint exists

$$
  (f^\ast \dashv f_\ast)

    \;\colon\;
  QCoh(X)
    \stackrel{\overset{f^\ast}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{f_\ast}{\longrightarrow}}
  QCoh(Y)
  \,.
$$

([[Quasi-Coherent Sheaves and Tannaka Duality Theorems|LurieQC, prop. 2.5.12]], [[Proper Morphisms, Completions, and the Grothendieck Existence Theorem|LurieProper, proposition 2.5.12]])

The [[projection formula]] in the dual form

$$
  f_\ast A \otimes B \longrightarrow f_\ast (A\otimes f^\ast B)
$$

for $f$ quasi-compact and quasi-separated appears as ([[Proper Morphisms, Completions, and the Grothendieck Existence Theorem|LurieProper, remark 1.3.14]]).

Now if all the conditions on $f$ hold, so that $(f_! \dashv f^\ast \dashv f_\ast) \;\colon\; QCoh(X) \longrightarrow QCoh(Y)$, then passing to opposite categories $QCoh(X)^{op} \longrightarrow QCoh(Y)^{op}$ exchanges the roles of $f_!$ and $f_\ast$, makes the projection formula be as in the above discussion and hence yields a Wirthmüller context.

The existence of [[dualizing modules]] $K$

$$
  D X = [X,K]
$$ 

is discussed in ([[Representability theorems|Lurie, Representability theorems, section 4.2]].)


## Structures in linear homotopy-type theory
 {#StructuresInLinearHomotopyTypeTheory}

We discuss here structures (constructions) that may be defined and studied within linear homotopy-type theory.


### Exponential modality and Fock spaces
 {#TheCanonicalComodality}

The original axiomatics for [[linear type theory]] in ([Girard 87](#Girard87)) contain in addition to the structures corresponding to a ([[star-autonomous category|star-autonomous]]) [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]] [[closed monoidal category]] a certain (co-)[[modality]] traditionally denoted "$!$", the _[[exponential modality]]_.
 
In ([Benton 95, p.9,15](#Benton95), [Bierman 95](#Bierman95))
it is noticed (reviewed in ([Barber 97, p. 21 (26)](#Barber97))) that a natural [[categorical semantics]] for this modality identifies it with the [[comonad]] that is induced from a [[strong monoidal adjunction]]

$$
  (\Sigma \dashv \Omega)
  \;\colon\;
  Mod(\ast)
  \stackrel{\overset{\Sigma}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Omega}{\longrightarrow}}
  \mathcal{C}
$$

between the [[closed monoidal category|closed]] [[symmetric monoidal category]] $Mod(\ast)$ which interprets the given [[linear type theory]] and a [[cartesian monoidal category]] $\mathcal{C}$.

If there is only the [[strong monoidal functor]] $\Sigma \;\colon\; \mathcal{C} \longrightarrow Mod(\ast)$ without possibly a [[right adjoint]] $\Omega$, then ([Barber 97, p. 21 (27)](#Barber97)) speaks of the _structural [[fragment]]_ of [[linear type theory]].


In ([Ponto-Shulman 12](#PontoShulman12)) it is observed that this in turn is canonically induced if $Mod(\ast)$ is the [[linear type theory]] over the trivial context $\ast$ of a dependent linear type theory ([[indexed closed monoidal category]]) with category of contexts being $\mathcal{C}$: 

+-- {: .num_defn #Sigma}
###### Definition

Let $Mod \colon \mathcal{C}^{op} \to MonCat$ be semantics for dependent linear type theory, def. \ref{SemanticsForDependentLinearTypeTheory}. Then for $X \in \mathcal{C}$ an object, set


$$
  \Sigma(X) \coloneqq \underset{X}{\sum} 1_X
  \in Mod(\ast)
$$

and for $f \;\colon\; Y \longrightarrow X$ a [[morphism]] in $\mathcal{C}$ set

$$
  \Sigma(f) 
    \coloneqq 
   \Sigma(Y)
    =
  \underset{Y}{\sum} 1_Y
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  \underset{X}{\sum} \underset{f}{\sum} f^\ast 1_X
  \stackrel{\underset{X}{\sum}(\epsilon_f)}{\longrightarrow}
  \underset{X}{\sum} 1_X
  =
  \Sigma(X)
  \,.
$$

=--

(In the typical kind of model this means to assign to a [[space]] $X$ the linear space of [[sections]] of the trivial [[line bundle]] over it.)

+-- {: .num_prop #SigmaFunctor}
###### Proposition

The construction in def. \ref{Sigma} gives a [[strong monoidal functor]]

$$
  \Sigma
  \;\colon\;
  \mathcal{C}
  \longrightarrow
  Mod(\ast)
$$

This is ([Ponto-Shulman 12, (4.3)](#PontoShulman12)). 

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

Below in example \ref{SigmaFunctorAsSecondaryTransform} we see that the functor $\Sigma$ in prop. \ref{SigmaFunctor} is a special case of a general construction of secondary integral trasnforms axiomatized in dependent linear type theory.

=--


This suggests the following definition.

+-- {: .num_defn #SemanticsForExponentialModality}
###### Definition

Given semantics for dependent linear type theory, def. \ref{SemanticsForDependentLinearTypeTheory} such that the functor $\Sigma$ from prop. \ref{SigmaFunctor} has a strong monoidal [[right adjoint]]

$$
  \Omega \colon Mod(\ast) \longrightarrow \mathcal{C}
$$

we say that _semantics for the [[exponential modality]]_ in the [[linear type theory]] over the point, whose semantics is $Mod(\ast)$, is the  [[comonad]] of the $(\Sigma \dashv \Omega)$-[[adjunction]]

$$
  ! \coloneqq \Sigma \circ \Omega \colon Mod(\ast) \to Mod(\ast)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark


The condition in def. \ref{SemanticsForExponentialModality} that $\Sigma$ (and its relative/dependent versions) has a [[right adjoint]] $\Omega$ may also be understood as saying that the dependent linear type theory satisfies the _[[axiom of comprehension]]_. See at _[comprehension -- Examples -- In dependent linear type theory](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/axiom+of+separation#ExamplesDependentLinearTypeTheory)_ for more.

###### Definition

For $\mathcal{C}^\otimes$ a [[closed monoidal category]] with [[unit object]] $1$ and [[internal hom]] $[-,-]$ write

$$
  \mathbb{D} \coloneqq [-,1] 
$$

for the [[functor]] given by internal hom into the unit object. In regarding $\mathcal{C}^\otimes$ as [[categorical semantics]] for [[linear type theory]] one may call this the _linear [[negation]]_ operation.

+-- {: .num_prop #DependentLinearDeMorganDuality}
###### Proposition 
**(dependent linear de Morgan duality)**

In semantics for a dependent linear type theory, def. \ref{SemanticsForDependentLinearTypeTheory}, linear negation, def. \ref{LinearNegation}, intertwines dependent sum and dependent product:

$$
  \underset{f}{\prod} \mathbb{D}
  \simeq
  \mathbb{D} \underset{f}{\sum}
$$

### Primary integral transforms

+-- {: .num_defn #PolynomialFunctorsAndCorrespondences}
###### Definition

Given semantics $Mod\colon \mathcal{C}^{op}\to SymMonCat$ for dependent linear type theory, def. \ref{SemanticsForDependentLinearTypeTheory}, and given objects $X_1, X_2$ of $\mathcal{C}$ then a **linear [[polynomial functor]]** 

$$
  P \colon Mod(X_1) \to Mod(X_2)
$$ 

is a functor of the form

$$
  P \simeq \underset{f_2}{\sum} \underset{g}{\prod} f_1^\ast
$$

for a [[diagram]] in $\mathcal{C}$ of the form

$$
  \array{
    && Y &\stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow}& Z
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{f_1}}\swarrow  & && & \searrow^{\mathrlap{f_2}} 
    \\
    X_1
    &&
    && 
    &&
    X_2
  }
  \,.
$$

If here $g = id$ then this diagram is a [[correspondence]]

$$
  \array{
    &&  Z
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{f_1}}\swarrow  & & \searrow^{\mathrlap{f_2}} 
    \\
    X_1
    &&
    &&
    X_2
  }
$$

and the resulting $P \simeq \underset{f_2}{\sum}f_1 ^\ast$ is called a **linear polynomial functor** or **primary [[integral transform]]**.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

Given a [[correspondence]] as above, then the primary integral transform through it is equivalent to the pull-tensor-push operation through the [[product]] 

$$
  \underset{f_2}{\sum} \circ f_1^\ast
  \simeq
  \underset{p_2}{\sum}
  \circ
  \left( \left(f_1,f_2\right)_!\left(1_Z\right) \otimes \left(-\right)\right)

### Fundamental classes
 {#FundamentalClasses}

+-- {: .num_defn #FiberwiseFundamentalClass}
###### Definition

A _fiberwise twisted fundamental class_ $[f]$ on a morphism $f \colon X\to Y$ in $\mathcal{C}$ is 

1. a choice of dualizable object $\tau \in Mod(Y)$ (the twist);

1. a choice of equivalence 

   $$
     \underset{f}{\sum} f^\ast 1_X
     \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
     \underset{f}{\prod} f^\ast \tau
     \,.
   $$

=--

In this form this is stated in ([Schreiber 14](#Schreiber14)). 

+-- {: .num_remark #FundamentalClassFromAmbidexterity}
###### Remark

A special case of def. \ref{FiberwiseFundamentalClass} is obtained when the twist vanishes, $\tau = 1$, and when dependent sum and dependent product are naturally equivalent for all objects, $\sum_f \simeq \prod_f$. In this case the two adjoints to $f^\ast$ coincide to form an [[ambidextrous adjunction]]. This case is considered in ([Hopkins-Lurie](#HopkinsLurie)).

=--

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

In view of dependent linear de Morgan duality, prop. \ref{DependentLinearDeMorganDuality}, a fiberwise twisted fundamental class in def. \ref{FiberwiseFundamentalClass} is equivalently a choice of equivalence


$$
  \underset{f}{\sum} f^\ast 1_X
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  \mathbb{D}\underset{f}{\sum} f^\ast \mathbb{D}\tau
  \,,
$$

hence an identification of the dependent sum of the unit with the dual of the dependent sum of the twist.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #WirthmullerIsomorphism}
###### Proposition

A twisted fiberwise fundamental class $[f]$, def. \ref{FiberwiseFundamentalClass}, induces for all dualizable $A\in Mod(X)$ a [[natural equivalence]]

$$
  \mathbb{D} \underset{f}{\sum} f^\ast \mathbb{D}(A\otimes \tau)
  \simeq
  \underset{f}{\sum}f^\ast A
  \,.
$$

This is the "[Wirthmüller isomorphism](Wirthmüller%20context#ComparisonOfPushForwardsAndWirthmuelleriso)".

+-- {: .num_defn #ComponentOfFiberwiseClass}
###### Definition

For $[f]$ a twisted fiberwise fundamental class and for $A$ dualizable, write 

$$
  [f]_A
  \;\colon\;
  A \otimes \tau
  \stackrel{\mathbb{D}_{\epsilon_{\mathbb{D}(A \otimes \tau)}}}{\longrightarrow}
  \mathbb{D} \underset{f}{\sum} f^\ast (\mathbb{D}(A\otimes \tau))
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  \underset{f}{\sum}f^\ast A
$$

for the composite of the linear dual of the $(\sum_f \dashv f^\ast)$-[[counit of an adjunction|adjunction counit]] and the Wirthmüller isomorphism, prop. \ref{WirthmullerIsomorphism}.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

The key point is that the morphism in def. \ref{ComponentOfFiberwiseClass} goes in the reverse direction of the [[counit of an adjunction|adjunction counit]]. In this way it plays a role in the construction of secondary integral transforms [below](#SecondaryIntegralTransforms).

### Secondary integral transforms

For 

$$

    && &&
    X_2
  }
$$

a [[correspondence]] as in def. \ref{PolynomialFunctorsAndCorrespondences}, then an _[[integral kernel]]_ for it is the choice of

1. two dualizable objects $A_i \in Mod(X_i)$;

1. a morphism between their pullbacks to the correspondence space: 

   $$
     f_1^\ast A_1 \stackrel{K}{\longleftarrow} f_2^\ast A_2
     \,.
   $$

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #SIT}
###### Definition

Given 

1. a [[correspondence]] $X_1 \stackrel{f_1}{\longleftarrow} Z \stackrel{f_2}{\longrightarrow} X_2$ as in def. \ref{PolynomialFunctorsAndCorrespondences};

1. an [[integral kernel]] $K$ as in def. \ref{IntegralKernel};

1. a $\tau$-twisted fundamental class $[f_2]$ as in def. \ref{FiberwiseFundamentalClass}

we say that the induced _secondary integral transform_ is the morphism

$$
  \int_Z \Xi d \mu_f
  \;\colon\;
  \mathbb{D} \underset{X_1}{\sum} A_1
  \longrightarrow
  \mathbb{D}\underset{X_2}{\sum} (A_2\otimes \tau)
$$

which is the dual (the image under $\mathbb{D}(-)$) of the following composite:

$$
  \underset{X_1}{\sum} A_1
  \stackrel{\underset{X_1}{\sum}\epsilon_{A_1}}{\longleftarrow}
  \underset{X_1}{\sum}
  \underset{f_1}{\sum}
  f_1^\ast A_1
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\leftarrow}
  \underset{Z}{\sum}f_1^\ast A_1
  \stackrel{\underset{Z}{\sum} K}{\longleftarrow}
  \underset{Z}{\sum}f_2^\ast A_2
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\leftarrow}
  \underset{X_2}{\sum}\underset{f_2}{\sum} f_2^\ast A_2
  \stackrel{\underset{X_2}{\sum}[f_2]_{A_2}}{\longleftarrow}
  \underset{X_2}{\sum} (A_2\otimes \tau)
  \,,
$$

where the morphism on the left is the [[counit of an adjunction|adjunction counit]], the morphism in the middle is the given [[integral kernel]], and the morphism on the right is the given fundamental class.

=--

In this form this appears in ([Schreiber 14](#Schreiber14)). Specialized to the ambidextrous case of remark \ref{FundamentalClassFromAmbidexterity}, this is equivalent to the construction in ([Hopkins-Lurie](#HopkinsLurie)).

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

A [[correspondence]] $X_1 \stackrel{f_1}{\longleftarrow} Z \stackrel{f_2}{\longrightarrow} X_2$ may be thought of as a space $Z$ of "paths" or "trajectories" that connect points in $X_2$ to points in $X_1$. From this point of view definition \ref{SIT} is a linear map that takes functions on $X_2$ to functions on $X_1$ by pointwise forming a sum over paths connecting these points and adding all the contributions of the given [[integral kernel]] along these paths.

This is conceptually just how the [[path integral]] in [[physics]] is supposed to work, only that mostly it doesn't due to lack of a definition. However, at least some path integrals for [[topological field theories]] may be realized as secondary integral transforms of the above kind.

=--

+-- {: .num_example #SigmaFunctorAsSecondaryTransform}
###### Example

Consider the special case def. \ref{SIT} where the right leg of the correspondence is the identity

$$
  \array{
    && Z
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{f}}\swarrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{=}}
    \\
    X && && Z
  }
$$

and where the integral kernel is the identity

$$
  K = id_{1_Z} \colon id_Z^\ast 1_Z = 1_Z \to 1_Z = f^\ast 1_X
  \,.
$$

Then the associated secondary integral transform, def. \ref{SIT}, is the morphism

$$
  \underset{X}{\sum} 1_X
  \stackrel{\underset{\epsilon_f}{\sum}}{\longleftarrow}
  \underset{X}{\sum} \underset{f}{\sum} f^\ast 1_X 
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\longleftarrow}
  \underset{Z}{\sum} 1_Z
  \,.
$$

This is just the $\Sigma$-functor of def. \ref{Sigma}:


$$ 
  \mathbb{D}\int_Z id \, d\mu_f
  =
  \Sigma(f)
  \;
  \colon
  \;
  \Sigma(Z)
  \stackrel{\Sigma(f)}{\longleftarrow}
  \Sigma(X)
  \,.
