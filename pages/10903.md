## Idea

Dependent linear type theory is the combination of _[[dependent type theory]]_ and _[[linear type theory]]_, hence a [[type theory]] where linear types may dependent on ordinary intuitionistic types. An extension of the [[LF]] [[syntax]] by dependent linear types appears in ([Pfenning 96](#Pfenning96), [WCFW 03](#WCFW03)) and a dependent linear extension of [[system L]] in ([Spiwack 14, section 5](#Spiwack14)). What should be the [[categorical semantics]] of dependent linear type theory was discussed in ([Shulman 08](#Shulman08), [Ponto-Shulman 12](#PontoShulman12), [Shulman 12](#Shulman12), [Schreiber 14](#Schreiber14)). A proposal for an actual [[syntax]] for dependent linear type theory appears in ([Vákár 14](#Vakar14)).


 
Following the notion of [[hyperdoctrine]] this should mean, in terms of [[categorical semantics]], that dependent linear type theory is for each [[context]] $\Gamma$ a [[linear type theory]]/possibly-non-[[cartesian monoidal category|cartesian]] [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]] [[closed monoidal category]] $(\mathcal{C}_{\Gamma}, \otimes, 1)$ and for each [[homomorphism]] of [[contexts]] $f \;\colon\; \Gamma_1 \longrightarrow \Gamma_2$ functorially an [[adjoint triple]] of [[functors]]

$$
  (f_! \dashv f^\ast \dashv f_\ast) 
    \;\colon\; 
   \mathcal{C}_{\Gamma_1}
    \stackrel{\stackrel{f_!}{\longrightarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{f^\ast}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{f_\ast}{\leftarrow}}}
    \mathcal{C}_{\Gamma_2}
  \,.
$$

where $f^\ast$ is [[context extension]] and where the [[left adjoint]] $f_!$ and [[right adjoint]] $f_\ast$ are to be thought of as linear analogs of [[dependent sum]] and [[dependent product]], respectively. Moreover this should satisfy [[Frobenius reciprocity]], hence $f^\ast$ should be a strong [[closed monoidal functor]]. 

Equivalently this is an [[indexed closed monoidal category]] with fiberwise [[dual object|duals]].

Typically one would in addition demand the [[Beck-Chevalley condition]] for consecutive such adjoint triples.

In [[geometry]]/[[topos theory]] such a "linear hyperdoctrine" is known as _[[six operations]] yoga in [[Wirthmüller context|Wirtmüller flavor]]_. In fact there this appears in [[geometric homotopy theory]] ("[[derived functors]] on [[quasicoherent sheaves]]") hence as _dependent linear [[homotopy type theory]]_.

## Properties

### The canonical co-modality
 {#TheCanonicalComodality}

The original axiomatics for [[linear type theory]] in ([Girard 87](#Girard87)) contain in addition to the structures corresponding to a ([[star-autonomous category|star-autonomous]]) [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]] [[closed monoidal category]] a certain (co-)[[modality]] traditionally denoted "$!$", the [[!-modality]].
 
In ([Benton 95, p.9,15](#Benton95), [Bierman 95](#Bierman95))
it is noticed (reviewed in ([Barber 97, p. 21 (26)](#Barber97))) that a natural [[categorical semantics]] for this modality identifies it with the [[comonad]] that is induced from a [[strong monoidal adjunction]]

$$
  (\Sigma \dashv R)
  \;\colon\;
  \mathcal{C}
  \stackrel{\overset{\Sigma}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{R}{\longrightarrow}}
  S
$$

between the [[closed monoidal category|closed]] [[symmetric monoidal category]] $\mathcal{C}$ which interprets the given [[linear type theory]] and a [[cartesian monoidal category]] $S$.


If there is only the [[strong monoidal functor]] $\Sigma \;\colon\; S \longrightarrow \mathcal{C}$ without possibly a [[right adjoint]], then ([Barber 97, p. 21 (27)](#Barber97)) speaks of the _structural fragment_ of [[linear type theory]].


In ([Ponto-Shulman 12](#PontoShulman12)) it is observed that this in turn is canonically induced if $\mathcal{C} \simeq \mathcal{C}_\ast$ is the linear type theory over the trivial context of a dependent linear type theory/[[indexed closed monoidal category]] with category of contexts being $S$.

Namely in this case it is natural to set for $X \in S$

$$
  \Sigma(X) \coloneqq (\pi_X)_! (\pi_X)^\ast 1_{\ast}
  \,,
$$

where $\pi_X \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow \ast$ is the canonical morphism to the [[terminal object]] in $S$; and to set for $\phi \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Y$ any [[morphism]] in $S$

$$
  \Sigma(\phi) 
    \coloneqq 
   \Sigma(X)
    =
  (\pi_X)_! (\pi_X)^\ast 1_\ast
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  (\pi_Y)_! \phi_! \phi^\ast (\pi_Y)^\ast 1_\ast
  \stackrel{(\phi_Y)_!(\epsilon_\phi)}{\longrightarrow}
  (\pi_Y)_! \phi_! (\pi_Y)^\ast 1_\ast
  =
  \Sigma(Y)
  \,.
$$

(In the typical kind of model this means to assign to a [[space]] $X$ the linear space of [[sections]] of the trivial [[line bundle]] over it.)

One checks that this indeed makes $\Sigma$ be a [[strong monoidal functor]] ([Ponto-Shulman 12, (4.3)](#PontoShulman12)).

The condition that this $\Sigma$ (and its relative/dependent versions) has a [[right adjoint]] may also be understood as saying that the dependent linear type theory satisfies the _[[axiom of comprehension]]_. See at _[comprehension -- Examples -- In dependent linear type theory](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/axiom+of+separation#ExamplesDependentLinearTypeTheory)_ for more.
