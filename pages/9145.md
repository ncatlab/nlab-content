## Idea

_Lie differentiation_  is the process reverse to [[Lie integration]]. It sends a [[Lie group]] to its [[Lie algebra]] and more generally a [[Lie groupoid]] to its [[Lie algebroid]] and a [[smooth ∞-group]] to its [[L-∞ algebra]].

## Details

* For the moment, for ordinary [[Lie theory]] see at _[[Lie's three theorems]]_.

* For [[infinity-Lie theory]] see at _[synthetic differential infinity-groupoid -- Lie differentiation](synthetic+differential+infinity-groupoid#LieDifferentiation)_ .
