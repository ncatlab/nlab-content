## Idea

_Lie differentiation_  is the process reverse to [[Lie integration]]. It sends a [[Lie group]] to its [[Lie algebra]] and more generally a [[Lie groupoid]] to its [[Lie algebroid]] and a [[smooth ∞-group]] to its [[L-∞ algebra]].


* For the moment, for ordinary [[Lie theory]] see at _[[Lie's three theorems]]_.

* For [[infinity-Lie theory]] see at _[synthetic differential infinity-groupoid -- Lie differentiation](synthetic+differential+infinity-groupoid#LieDifferentiation)_ .

## Definition

A formalization of the notion Lie differentiation for "affine algebraic spaces" [[higher geometry]] has been given in ([Lurie](#Lurie)), inspired by and building on results discussed at _[[model structure for L-∞ algebras]]_. This we discuss in

* [For deformation contexts](#ForDeformationContexts)

An adaption of this to geometric contexts which in particular admits the formulation of Lie differentiation of [[Lie groups]] and generally of [[smooth ∞-groups]] we then discuss in 

* [For cohesive contexts](#ForCohesiveContexts)

###### Definition

A **[[deformation context]]** is an [[(∞,1)-category]] $\mathcal{Y}$ such that

1. it is a [[presentable (∞,1)-category]];

1. it contains a [[terminal object in an (∞,1)-category|terminal object]]

together with a [[set]] of [[objects]] $\{E_\alpha \in Stab(\mathcal{Y})\}$ in the [[stabilization]] of $\mathcal{Y}$.

=--

This is ([Lurie, def. 1.1.3](#Lurie)) together with the assumption of a terminal object stated (and later implicialy used) on p.9.

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Definition \ref{DeformationContext} is meant to be read as follows:

First, we think of $\mathcal{Y}$ as an [[opposite (∞,1)-category]] of [[pointed object|pointed]] spaces in some [[higher geometry]]. The point is the [[initial object]] in $\mathcal{Y}^{op}$ which is the terminal object in $\mathcal{Y}$. 

Then we think of the formal duals of the objects $\{E_\alpha\}_\alpha$ as a set of generating [[infinitesimally thickened points]].

=--

The following construction generates the "[[jets]]" induced by the generating infinitesimally thickened points.

+-- {: .num_defn #SmallObjects}
###### Definition

Given a [[deformation context]] $(\mathcal{Y}, \{E_\alpha\}_\alpha)$, we say

* a [[morphism]] in $\mathcal{Y}$ is an **elementary morphism** if it is the [[homotopy fiber]] to a map into $\Omega^{\infty -n}E_\alpha$ for some $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ and some $\alpha$;

* a morphism is a **small morphism** if it is the composite of [[finite set|finitely]] many elementary morphisms.

We write

$$
  \mathcal{Y}^{inf} \hookrightarrow \mathcal{Y}
$$

for the full [[sub-(∞,1)-category]] on those objects $A$ for which the essentially unique map $A \to *$ is small.

###### Definition

Given a [[deformation context]] $(\mathcal{Y}, \{E_\alpha\}_\alpha)$, def. \ref{DeformationContext}, the [[(∞,1)-category]] of **[[formal moduli problems]]** over it is the full [[sub-(∞,1)-category]] of the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-presheaves]] over $\mathcal{Y}^{inf}$

$$
  Moduli^\mathcal{Y}
  \hookrightarrow
  [\mathcal{Y}^{inf}, \infty Grpd]
$$

on those [[(∞,1)-functors]] $X \colon \mathcal{Y}^{inf} \to \infty Grpd$ such that

1. over the [[terminal object]] they are [[contractible]]: $X(*) \simeq *$;

1. they preserves [[(∞,1)-pullbacks]].

([Lurie, def. 1.1.14](#Lurie))

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

This means that a "formal deformation problem" is a [[space]] in [[higher geometry]] whose geometric structure is detected by the "test spaces" in $\mathcal{Y}^{op}$ in a way that respects gluing ([[descent]]) in $\mathcal{Y}^{op}$ as given by [[(∞,1)-pullbacks]] there. The first condition requires that there is an essentially unique such probe by the point, hence that these higher geometric space has essentially a single global point. This is the condition that reflects the infinitesimal nature of the deformation problem.

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

Given a [[deformation context]] $\mathcal{Y}$, the restricted [[(∞,1)-Yoneda embedding]] gives an [[(∞,1)-functor]]

$$
  Lie \colon \mathcal{Y} \to Moduli^{\mathcal{Y}}
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

For $Y \in \mathcal{Y}^{op}$, the object $Lie(Y)$ represents the _[[formal geometry|formal neighbourhood]]_ of the basepoint of $Y$ as seen by the infinitesimally thickened points dual to the $\{E_\alpha\}$.

Hence we may call this the operaton of **Lie differentiation** of spaces in $\mathcal{Y}^{op}$ around their given base point.
