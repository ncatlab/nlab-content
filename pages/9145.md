## Idea

_Lie differentiation_  is the process reverse to [[Lie integration]]. It sends a [[Lie group]] to its [[Lie algebra]] and more generally a [[Lie groupoid]] to its [[Lie algebroid]] and a [[smooth ∞-group]] to its [[L-∞ algebra]].


* For the moment, for ordinary [[Lie theory]] see at _[[Lie's three theorems]]_.

* For [[infinity-Lie theory]] see at _[synthetic differential infinity-groupoid -- Lie differentiation](synthetic+differential+infinity-groupoid#LieDifferentiation)_ .

## Definition

A formalization of the notion Lie differentiation in [[higher geometry]] has been given in ([Lurie](#Lurie)), inspired by and building on results discussed at _[[model structure for L-∞ algebras]]_. This we discuss in

* [For deformation contexts](#ForDeformationContexts)

We then specialize this to those _[[deformation contexts]]_, def. \ref{DeformationContext}, that arise in the formalization of [[higher differential geometry]] by [[differential cohesion]]:

* [For cohesive contexts](#ForCohesiveContexts)

This is the context in which one has a natural formulation of ordinary Lie differentiation of ordinary [[Lie groups]] to [[Lie algebras]] and its generalization to the Lie differentiation of [[smooth ∞-groups]] to [[L-∞ algebras]]. See the discussion of _[Examples](#Examples)_ below for more.


### For deformation contexts
 {#ForDeformationContexts}


+-- {: .num_defn #DeformationContext}
###### Definition

A **[[deformation context]]** is an [[(∞,1)-category]] $Sp_*$ such that

1. it is a [[presentable (∞,1)-category]];

1. it contains an [[initial object in an (∞,1)-category|initial object]]

and 

* equipped with a [[set]] of [[objects]] 

  $$
    \{E_\alpha \in Stab(Sp_*^{op})\}
  $$ 

  in the [[stabilization]] of the [[opposite (∞,1)-category]] $Sp_*^{op}$.

=--

This is ([Lurie, def. 1.1.3](#Lurie)) together with the assumption of a terminal object in $Sp_*^{op}$ stated on p.9 (and later implicialy used).

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Definition \ref{DeformationContext} is meant to be read as follows:

We think of $Sp_*$ as an [[(∞,1)-category]] of [[pointed object|pointed]] [[spaces]] in some [[higher geometry]]. The point is the initial object.
We think of the formal duals of the objects $\{E_\alpha\}_\alpha$ as a set of generating [[infinitesimally thickened points]] (points in [[formal geometry]]).

=--

The following construction generates the "[[jets]]" induced by the generating infinitesimally thickened points.

+-- {: .num_defn #SmallObjects}
###### Definition

Given a [[deformation context]] $(Sp_*, \{E_\alpha\}_\alpha)$, we say

* a [[morphism]] in $Sp_*^{op}$ is an **elementary morphism** if it is the [[homotopy fiber]] to a map into $\Omega^{\infty -n}E_\alpha$ for some $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ and some $\alpha$;

* a morphism in $Sp_*^{op}$ is a **small morphism** if it is the composite of [[finite set|finitely]] many elementary morphisms.

We write

$$
  Sp_*^{inf} \hookrightarrow Sp_*
$$

for the full [[sub-(∞,1)-category]] on those objects $A$ for which the essentially unique map $A \to *$ is small.

=--

([Lurie, def. 1.1.8](#Lurie))

+-- {: .num_defn #FormalModuliProblem}
###### Definition

Given a [[deformation context]] $(Sp_*, \{E_\alpha\}_\alpha)$, def. \ref{DeformationContext}, the [[(∞,1)-category]] of **[[formal moduli problems]]** over it is the full [[sub-(∞,1)-category]] of the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-presheaves]] over $Sp_*^{inf}$

$$
  FormalModuli^{Sp_*}
  \hookrightarrow
  PSh_\infty(Sp_*^{inf})
$$

on those [[(∞,1)-functors]] $X \colon (Sp_*^{inf})^{op} \to \infty Grpd$ such that

1. over the [[terminal object]] they are [[contractible]]: $X(*) \simeq *$;

1. they sends [[(∞,1)-colimits]] in $Sp_*^{inf}$ to [[(∞,1)-limits]] in [[∞Grpd]].

=--

([Lurie, def. 1.1.14](#Lurie))


([Lurie, remark 1.1.7](#Lurie)).

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

This means that a "formal deformation problem" is a [[space]] in [[higher geometry]] whose geometric structure is detected by the "test spaces" in $Sp_*^{inf}$ in a way that respects gluing ([[descent]]) in $Sp_*^{inf}$ as given by [[(∞,1)-colimits]] there. The first condition requires that there is an essentially unique such probe by the point, hence that these higher geometric space have essentially a single global point. This is the condition that reflects the infinitesimal nature of the deformation problem.

=--

We will often just write $Sp_*$ for a deformation context $(Sp_*, \{E_\alpha\}_\alpha)$, when the objects $\{E_\alpha\}$ are understood.

+-- {: .num_prop #FormalModuliIsPresentableCategory}
###### Proposition

The [[(∞,1)-category]] $FormalModuli^{Sp_*}$ of [[formal moduli problems]] is a [[presentable (∞,1)-category]]. Moreover it is a [[reflective sub-(∞,1)-category]] of the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-presheaves]]

$$
  FormalModuli^{Sp_*}
  \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\hookrightarrow}
  PSh_{\infty}(Sp_*)
  \,.
$$

=--


+-- {: .num_prop #LieDifferentiationFunctor}
###### Proposition

Given a [[deformation context]] $Sp_*$, the restricted [[(∞,1)-Yoneda embedding]] gives an [[(∞,1)-functor]]

$$
  Lie \;\colon\; Sp_* \to FormalModuli^{Sp_*}
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

For $(X,x) \in Sp_*$, the object $Lie(X,x)$ represents the _[[formal geometry|formal neighbourhood]]_ of the basepoint $x$ of $X$ as seen by the infinitesimally thickened points dual to the $\{E_\alpha\}$.

Hence we may call this the operation of **Lie differentiation** of spaces in $Sp_*$ around their given base point.

In the archetypical implementation of these axiomatics, discuss [below](#Examples), there is an [[equivalence of (∞,1)-categories]] of [[formal moduli problems]] with [[L-∞ algebras]] and the Lie differentiation of the [[delooping]]/[[moduli ∞-stack]] $\mathbf{B}G$ of a [[smooth ∞-group]] $G$ is its [[L-∞ algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$: $Lie(\mathbf{B}G) \simeq \mathbf{B}\mathfrak{g}$.

###### Proposition

The Lie differentiation functor 

$$
  Lie 
  \;
  \colon
  \;
  Sp_* \to FormalModuli^{Sp_*}
$$

of prop. \ref{LieDifferentiationFunctor} preserves [[(∞,1)-limits]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By prop. \ref{FormalModuliIsPresentableCategory} the [[(∞,1)-limits]] in $FormalModuli^{Sp_*}$ may be computed in $PSh_\infty(Sp_*)$.  There the statement is that of the [[(∞,1)-Yoneda embedding]], or rather just the statement that the [[derived hom space|(∞,1)-hom (∞,1)-functor]] $Sp_*(D,-)$ preserves $(\infty,1)$-limits.

### For cohesive contexts
 {#ForCohesiveContexts}

> under construction


Let $\mathbf{H}_{th}$ be a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] $(&#643; \dashv \flat \dashv \sharp)$ equipped with 
[[differential cohesion]] $(Red \dashv &#643;_{inf} \dashv \flat_{inf})$.


+-- {: .num_defn #ExhibitingInfinitesimalCohesion}
###### Definition

A set of objects $\{D_\alpha \in \mathbf{H}_{th}\}_\alpha$
is said to **exhibit the differential structure** or 
**exhibit the infinitesimal thickening** of $\mathbf{H}_{th}$ if the 
[[localization of an (∞,1)-category|localization]] 

$$
  L_{\{D_\alpha\}} \mathbf{H}_{th}
  \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\hookrightarrow}
  \mathbf{H}_{th}
$$

of $\mathbf{H}_{th}$
at the morphisms of the form $D_\alpha \times X \to X$
is exhibited by the [[infinitesimal shape modality]] $&#643;_{inf} \coloneqq i^* i_*$

$$
  \mathbf{H} 
  \simeq 
  L_{\{D_\alpha\}} \mathbf{H}_{th}
  \stackrel{\overset{i^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{i_*}{\hookrightarrow}}
  \mathbf{H}_{th}
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_Remark }
###### Remark

Def. \ref{ExhibitingInfinitesimalCohesion} expresses 
the [[infinitesimal cohesion|infinitesimal]] 
analog of the notion of objects exhibiting [[cohesion]],
see at <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/cohesive+%28infinity,1%29-topos+--+structures">structures in cohesion -- A1-homotopy and the continuum</a>, 
hence an infinitesimal notion of [[A1-homotopy theory]]. 

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #ObjectsExhibitingDifferentialCohesionAreUniquelyPointed}
###### Proposition

If objects $\{D_\alpha \in \mathbf{H}_{th}\}$ exhibit the differential cohesion of $\mathbf{H}_{th}$, 
then they are essentially uniquely pointed.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The localizing objects are in particular themselves [[local objects]]
so that $&#643;_{inf} D_\alpha \simeq *$. 
By the $(Red \dashv &#643;_{inf})$-[[adjunctions]] this means that

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \mathbf{H}_{th}(*, D_\alpha)
    & \simeq \mathbf{H}_{th}(Red(*), D_\alpha)
    \\
    & \simeq \mathbf{H}_{th}(*, &#643;_{inf} D_\alpha)
    \\
    & \simeq \mathbf{H}_{th}(*, *)
    \\
    & \simeq *
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

=--

We now consider $(\mathbf{H}_{th}^{\ast/}, \{D_\alpha\})$
as a [[deformation context]], def. \ref{DeformationContext}. 

+-- {: .num_defn #LieDifferentiationInCohesion}
###### Definition

for the Lie differentiaon [[(∞,1)-functor]], def. \ref{LieDifferentiationFunctor}, 
which sends $(x \colon * \to X) \in \mathbf{H}_{th}$ to 

$$
  Lie(X,x)

  D
  \mapsto \mathbf{H}^{\ast/}(D,(X,x))
