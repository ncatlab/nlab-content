In macroscopic [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] systems one deals with a large number of microscopic particles. The number of particles is, for 'human sized' systems (e.g. engines, rooms), roughly on the order of the _Avogadro constant_ (or \'Avogadro's number\' in historical usage). This constant is used as a scaling factor between macroscopic and microscopic observations.

More precisely, **Avogadro's number** is defined as the number of [[atom]]s in $0.012 $ [[kg]] of the [[carbon]] [[isotope]] $C^12$. This is roughly the [[natural number]]

$$
  6.02214179(30)\times 10^{23}   \in \mathbb{N}
  \,.
$$

An amount of any chemical substance which contains precisely this number of [[molecule]]s is called a **mole** of substance. So in particular, by definition, a mole of $C^{12}$ is precisely of weight $12 g$.

Of course the choice of $12 g$ of $C^{12}$ is entirely arbitrary and just serves as some example of a typical laboratory-scale macroscopic quantity.

Accordingly, later it was found useful to have different such macroscopic reference quantities, for instance the _pound mole_ . For exchanging between these it was found useful to introduce [[unit]]s.

Now the **Avogadro constant** is taken to be

$$
  N_A = 6.02214179(30)\times 10^{23} mol^{-1}
  \,.
$$

(Strictly speaking this is $N_A = 1 \in \mathbb{Z}$.)
