## Definition

Given a [[metric space]] $(X,d)$, the _metric topology_ on $X$ is the structure of a [[topological space]] on $X$ which is generated from the [[basis of a  topology]] given by the [[open balls]] 

$$
  B(x,r) \coloneqq \{x \in X \;|\; d(x,y) \lt r \}
$$

for all $x \in X$ and $r \in (0,\infty) \subset \mathbb{R}$.

A topological space whose topology is the metric topology for some [[metric space]] structure on its underlying set is called a _[[metrizable topological space]]_.
