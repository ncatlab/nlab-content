## Idea

An ordinary [[group]] is either an [[abelian group]] or not. For an [[∞-group]] there is an infinite tower of notions ranging from completely non-abelian to completely abelian. An _abelian ∞-group_ is one which is maximally abelian. This is equivalently a [[connective spectrum object]].

## Proposition

### Relation to commutative $\infty$-rings

+-- {: .num_defn #GroupOfUnitsFunctor} 
###### Definition

Write

$$
  gl_1 \; \colon \;  CRing_\infty \to AbGrp_\infty
$$

for the [[(∞,1)-functor]] which sends a [[E-∞ ring|commutative ∞-ring]] to its [[∞-group of units]].

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

The [[∞-group of units]] [[(∞,1)-functor]] of def. \ref{GroupOfUnitsFunctor} is a  right-[[adjoint (∞,1)-functor]] (or at least a [[right adjoint]] on [[homotopy category of an (∞,1)-category|homotopy categories]])

$$
  CRing_\infty 
  \stackrel{\overset{\mathbb{S}[-]}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{gl_1}{\to}}
  AbGrp_\infty
  \,.
$$

This is ([ABGHR 08, theorem 2.1](#ABGHR08)).


## Examples

* A [[0-truncated]] abelian $\infty$-group is equivalently an [[abelian group]].

* A [[1-truncated]] abelian $\infty$-group is equivalently a [[symmetric 2-group]].

* A [[2-truncated]] abelian $\infty$-group is equivalently a [[symmetric 3-group]].
