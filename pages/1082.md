Abstractly, a __differential__ is the morphism of a [[differential object]] defining a [[chain complex]].

So in a [[category with translation]] $T : C \to C$ a differential is a morphism $d_V : V \to T(V)$ for some [[object]] $V$ such that

$$
  V \stackrel{d_V}{\to} T V \stackrel{T(d_V)}{\to}
  T T V
$$

is the [[zero morphism]].

Unwrapping this for the case where the [[category with translation]] is a [[category of chain complexes]], it reproduces the ordinary notion of a differential as a degree-$(-1)$ morphism that squares to $0$.
