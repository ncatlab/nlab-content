# Definition #

A **strong monomorphism** in a [[category]] $C$ is a [[monomorphism]] which is right [[orthogonality|orthogonal]] to any [[epimorphism]].  The dual notion is, of course, [[strong epimorphism]].

# Remarks #

* If $C$ has [[coequalizer]]s, then any morphism which is right orthogonal to epimorphisms must automatically be a monomorphism.

* Every [[regular monomorphism]] is strong.

* Every strong monomorphism is [[extremal monomorphism|extremal]]; the converse is true if $C$ has [[pushout]]s.

# Examples #

* A nice example of strong monomorphisms in a category are the subspace inclusions in the category of [[diffeological space]]s.  In this setting, any subset $Y$ of a diffeological space $X$ is again a diffeological space.  If smooth, the inclusion $\iota:Y \rightarrow X$ is always a monomorphism, but it is a strong monomorphism if and only if $Y$ has "enough" plots, that is if $\varphi: U\rightarrow Y$ is a plot if and only if the composite $\iota\varphi: U\rightarrow X$ is a plot.
