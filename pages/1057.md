# Definition #

A **strong monomorphism** in a [[category]] $C$ is a [[monomorphism]] which is right [[orthogonality|orthogonal]] to any [[epimorphism]].  The dual notion is, of course, [[strong epimorphism]].

# Remarks #

* If $C$ has [[coequalizer]]s, then any morphism which is right orthogonal to epimorphisms must automatically be a monomorphism.

* Every [[regular monomorphism]] is strong.

* Every strong monomorphism is [[extremal monomorphism|extremal]]; the converse is true if $C$ has [[pushout]]s.
