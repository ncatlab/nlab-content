## Idea

The notion of _elliptic chain complex_ is the generalization of the notion of [[elliptic operator]] from single [[linear maps]] to [[chain complexes]] of linear maps. 

## Definition

For $X$ a [[smooth manifold]] and $\{E_k\}_{k \in \mathbb{Z}}$ a collection of [[vector bundles]] over $X$, a [[chain complex]] of [[differential operators]] between the spaces of [[sections]] of these bundles

$$
  \cdots \to \Gamma(E_{k+1}) \stackrel{P_k}{\to} \Gamma(E_k) \to \cdots 
$$

is called an **elliptic chain complex** if the corresponding sequence of [[symbol of a differential operator|symbols]]

$$
  \cdots \to \pi^* E_{k+1} \stackrel{\sigma(P_k)}{\to} \pi^* E_k \to \cdots
$$

(where $\pi \colon T^* X \to X$ is the [[cotangent bundle]]) is an [[exact sequence]].

For instance ([Pati, def. 9.4.1](#Pati)).

For a single differential operator $P$ this says that $0 \to \pi^* E_1 \stackrel{\sigma(P)}{\to} \pi^* E_0 \to 0$ is exact, which means that $\sigma(P)$ is an [[isomorphism]], hence that $P$ is an [[elliptic operator]].

## Examples

The classical examples of elliptic complexes are discussed also in ([Gilkey section 3](#Gilkey)).

### de Rham complex

Let $X$ be a compact smooth manifold. Then the [[de Rham complex]] is an ellptic complex. The corresponding [[index of an elliptic complex]] is the [[Euler characteristic]]

$$
  Ind(\Omega^\bullet(X),d)  
  = 
  \chi(X)
  = 
  \sum_{p = 0}^{dim X} (-1)^p  dim H_{dR}^p(X, \mathbb{C})
$$

### The Yang-Mills complex

(...)

### The Dolbeault complex

(...) [[Dolbeault complex]]

The [[index of an elliptic complex]] of the Dolbeault complex is the [[arithmetic genus]]

### Spin complex

(...) index is [[A-hat genus]] (...)
