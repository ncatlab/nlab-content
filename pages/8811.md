## Idea

A generalization of the notion of [[elliptic operator]].

## Definition

For $X$ a [[smooth manifold]] and $\{E_k\}_{k \in \mathbb{Z}}$ a collection of [[vector bundles]] over $X$, a [[chain complex]] of [[differential operators]] between the spaces of [[sections]] of these bundles

$$
  \cdots \to \Gamma(E_{k+1}) \stackrel{P_k}{\to} \Gamma(E_k) \to \cdots 
$$

is called an **elliptic chain complex** if the corresponding sequence of [[symbol of a differential operator|symbols]]

$$
  \cdots \to \pi^* E_{k+1} \stackrel{\sigma(P_k)}{\to} \pi^* E_k \to \cdots
$$

(where $\pi \colon T^* X \to X$ is the [[cotangent bundle]]) is an [[exact sequence]].

For a single differetial operator $P$ this says that $0 \to \pi^* E_1 \stackrel{\sigma(P)}{\to} \pi^* E_0 \to 0$ is exact, which means that $\sigma(P)$ is an [[isomorphism]], hence that $P$ is an [[elliptic operator]].
