__Otto Schreier__ (1901-1929) was a German algebraist born in Vienna famous for his work in combinatorial group theory 
(Nielsen-Schreier method and HNN-extensions). His 1926 article on extensions of groups contains ideas of nonabelian cohomology and pseudofunctors; nowdays this is called the Schreier's theory of (nonabelian) extensions. The work has been completed by Eilenberg and MacLane in a series of 3 papers in late 1940-s. Higher analogues of Schreier's theory were studied by L. Breen.
