__Otto Schreier__ (1901--1929) was a German algebraist born in Vienna famous for his work in [[combinatorial group theory]] 
([[Nielsen-Schreier theorem|Nielsen--Schreier method]] and HNN-extensions). His 1926 article on [[group extensions|extensions of groups]] contains ideas of [[nonabelian cohomology]] and [[pseudofunctors]]; nowadays this is called _Schreier's theory of (nonabelian) extensions_. The work has been completed by [[Sammy Eilenberg|Eilenberg]] and [[Saunders Mac Lane|Mac Lane]] in a series of three papers in the late 1940s. Higher analogues of Schreier's theory were studied by L. Breen. Schreier's theory can be also extended to some other algebraic structures, see e.g. [[nonabelian Lie algebra cohomology]].
