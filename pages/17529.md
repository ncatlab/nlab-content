###### Theorem

Every [[finitely generated object|finitely generated]] [[abelian group]] $A$ is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to a [[direct sum]] of [[p-primary groups|p-primary]] [[cyclic groups]] $\mathbb{Z}/p^k \mathbb{Z}$ (for $p$ a [[prime number]] and $k$ a [[natural number]] ) and copies of the infinite cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}$:

$$
  A 
  \;\simeq\;
  \mathbb{Z}^n
   \oplus
  \underset{i}{\bigoplus}
   \mathbb{Z}/p_i^{k_i} \mathbb{Z}
  \,.
$$

In particular every [[finite group|finite]] [[abelian group]] is of this form  for $n = 0$, hence is a [[direct sum]] of [[cyclic groups]]. (The "fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups".)
 


In particular every [[cyclic group]] $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ is a [[direct sum]] of cyclic groups. Moreover, for each natural number $d$ dividing $n$ it contains one copy of $\mathbb{Z}/d\mathbb{Z}$ as a [[subgroup]], which is the subgroup generated by $n/d \in \mathbb{Z}\to \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$. In fact the [[lattice of subgroups]] of $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ is the [[formal dual]] of the lattice of [[natural numbers]] $\leq n$ ordered by divisibility.

This is a special case of the _[[ structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain]]_.
