Philip J. Higgins (born 1926) is a British  mathematician, who has worked in areas of algebra and algebraic topology.  He is well known for his book 

* P. J. Higgins, _Categories and groupoids_, [Repr. Theory Appl. Categ., 1 â€“ 178](http://www.emis.de/journals/TAC/reprints/articles/7/tr7abs.html) (electronic), ISSN 
1201-561X, reprint of the 1971 original _Notes on categories and groupoids_, (Van Nostrand 
Reinhold, London; MR0327946) with a new preface by the author. 

and for his long standing collaboration with [[Ronnie Brown]] on [[nonabelian algebraic topology]], see [here](http://www.bangor.ac.uk/~mas010/nonab-a-t.html).

His earlier paper

* P. J. Higgins, _Algebras with a scheme of operators_, Math. Nachr. 27 (1963) 115--132.

 has been influential: it deals with partial operations, following on from his paper

* P. J. Higgins, _Groups with multiple operators_, Proc London Math. Soc. VI (1956) 366-416.  


His paper

* P. J. Higgins, _The fundamental groupoid of a graph of groups_, J. London Math. Soc. (2), 13 (1976)  145--149,

developed methods that were later on used by [[Haefliger]] in assigning a groupoid to a complex of groups.


Recently he worked with [[Kirill Mackenzie]] on [[Lie groupoids]] and [[Lie algebroids]]
