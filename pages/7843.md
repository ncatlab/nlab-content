###### Theorem and Definition
Let $G$ be an [[affine scheme|affine]] [[group scheme|k-group]]. Then the following conditions are equivalent.

1. The [[completion]] of the [[Cartier duality|Cartier dual]] $\hat D(G)$ of $G$ is a connected formal group.

1. Any [[multiplicative group scheme|multiplicative subgroup]] of $G$ is zero.

1. For any subgroup $H$ of $G$ with $H\neq 0$ we have $Gr_k(H,\alpha_k)\neq 0$.

1. Any algebraic quotient of $G$ is an extension of subgroups of $\alpha_k$.

1. (If $p\neq 0)$, $\cap Im V^n_G =e$.

An affine group scheme satisfying these conditions is called *unipotent group scheme*.
