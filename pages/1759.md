[[!include all changes]]

A list of all recently edited entries can be seen here:

* [Recently Revised](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/recently_revised).

But that list tends to contain lots of minor changes: it's not easy to spot the important ones.

So, if you feel people's attention should be drawn to some changes you make, please mention them *here*.  That will help [[Contributors|the rest of us]] spot them, so we can learn what you know --- and maybe make further improvements!

These comments should go in _reverse_ chronological order, so that the latest are on top of the list. To keep the list international, use the date in UTC (the date given by the server for your edits).

## 2009-07-01

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:
   *  [[Andrew Stacey]] may be interested to see how I\'ve changed the formatting of the goal box at [[Froelicher space]].
   *  Incorporated Zoran\'s new references at [[principal 2-bundle]] into the text.
   *  Added a note at [[group]] how $Grp$ is a full sub-$2$-category of $Grpd_*$ (even though not of $Grpd$).

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]

  * expanded at [[group]] on the statement that "a group is a groupoid with a single object"

  * added to [[loop space object]] the true definition, added also an "idea" section, links to related entries and an introductory blurb to the original material

  * created [[delooping]] for the matter discussed by [[Eric Forgy|Eric]] and [[Toby Bartels|Toby]] at [[Dijkgraaf-Witten theory]]

  * added Jardine-Luo reference to [[principal 2-bundle]] and [[principal infinity-bundle]]

  * added to [[Froelicher space]] an "Idea" and a "Reference" section, prompoted by the blog entry [here](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/07/laubinger_on_lie_algebras_for.html)

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:
   *  I archived the [[2009 June changes]] by the sneaky method of changing this page\'s name, copying the header and footer text (with appropriate changes) from the previous archive, and then creating this page anew.  Maybe that will keep us from testing Instiki\'s tolerance for pages with thousands of edits in their history.  (^_^)
   *  I\'ve completed migrating all old redirect pages to history pages; all links within the body of the Lab should now take you immediately to the target page.  (There are a few victims of a bug, but I\'ll straighten that out with Jacques.)  I have [more comments](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Vanilla/nForum/comments.php?DiscussionID=39) on the Forum.
