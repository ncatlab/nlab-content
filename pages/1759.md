A list of all recently edited entries can be seen here:

* [Recently Revised](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/recently_revised).

But that list tends to contain lots of minor changes: it's not easy to spot the important ones.

So, if you feel people's attention should be drawn to some changes you make, please mention them *here*.  That will help [[Contributors|the rest of us]] spot them, so we can learn what you know --- and maybe make further improvements!

These comments should go in _reverse_ chronological order, so that the latest are on top of the list. To keep the list international, use the date in UTC (the date given by the server for your edits).

## 2009-07-06

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:
   *  I would like to suggest that the appearance of links to nonexistent pages is a *feature* that we should not break.  Thus we should not create blank pages (or pages that are blank except for redirects) but instead create pages only when we have something to put there.  Conversely, we shouldn\'t change links to go to redirected forms (as at [[geometric infinity-function theory]] currently) unless the redirects have actually been created.  If this means that we have things like `[[∞-foo|infinity-foo]]` (when nobody has written about $\infty$-foos yet), then we\'re no worse off than before we had redirects, and the appearance of links to nonexistent pages still tells us something.  (Note: there is some related discussion now hidden under July 3.)
   *  A question at [[cogroup]] about what we really want there.  (Surely more than just the empty set?)

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]] 

  * added to [[principal bundle]] a long detailed section called "the $G$-action from the homotopy pullback" -- this may look like weird overkill, but the point is that this serves as a warmup for an analogous discussion at [[principal infinity-bundle]]

  * rediscovered that we had an entry [[Cech methods]] and added lots of links to that

  * provided explicit details at [[Cech cohomology]] for the general (nonabelian) case in low degree

* [[Zoran Škoda]]: created [[small fibration]], added more general discussion on [[endomorphism monoids]]. 

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]] created [[Cech cohomology]]

* [[David Corfield|David]]

  * more suggestions than changes, but it would be good to have entries for [[cogroup]] and [[co-H-space]]. Could [[homotopy group]] and [[cohomology group]] be made to resemble each other more? I.e., must the former be restricted to $n$-spheres as domain? Hmm, is something suboptimal about H-group and H-cogroup, whereas H-space and co-H-space? Perhaps 'co' and 'H' commute.

    * [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: it would in principle be good to have expositions at [[cohomology]], [[cohomology group]] and [[homotopy]], [[homotopy group]] be more symmetric -- we just have to beware that we'd be going into untrodden territory and should indicate accordingly: while generalized cohomologies of all sorts are becoming familiar, I can't recall having seen mentioned the corresponding dual notion of generalized homotopy anywhere but in our discussion -- so we should maybe tag the corresponding discussion, if we implrement it, with a box saying "this is research material" or the like -- but I would enjoy it if we did so

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]

  * created [[groupoid object in an (infinity,1)-category]]

    * added a discussion of this at [[delooping]], a brief reference to it at [[quotient object]] and a link to it in the fourth $\inft$-Giraud-axiom at [[(infinity,1)-topos]]


## 2009-07-05

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:
   *  Mentioned [[endomorphism monoids]] too.
   *  Tried to give Tim some comfort at [[pseudofunctor]].

* [[Urs Schreiber]]

  * added a tiny bit of discussion to [[principal infinity-bundle]] about how the homotopy pullback definition gives the $G$-action and vice versa. But need to say more here.

    * By the way has anyone seen [[Mike Shulman|Mike]]? I know that he has thought about this, it's related to his [[michaelshulman:exactness hypothesis|exactness hypothesis]].


## 2009-07-04

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  Mentioned [[automorphism groups]].

*  [[Tim]]: I have asked a silly question at [[pseudofunctor]], but would appreciate an answer. Can I make a plea to someone to provide a more detailed treatment of the Grothendieck construction as well. (I mean the one which is related to the pseudocolimit. At least a general reference to that should be in the entry.)

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:
   *  Put some stuff at [[equality]], but there is much more that could and should be said there.
   *  Added some pretty broad examples to [[evil]].

*  [[Tim]]: I have added new references to [[distributor]] and [[Grothendieck fibration]].

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  Added a bit to the scandalously short page [[isomorphism]].


## 2009-07-03

*  [[Eric Forgy]] created [[exchange law]] blank (perhaps by accident?) and [[Toby Bartels]] wrote a very brief stub there.
   *  _Eric_: This was not an accident. I was cleaning some pages and wanted a redirect for [[exchange laws]], but [[exchange law]] did not exist yet, so I created it so I could insert a redirect assuming (correctly) that someone would fill in some content.
   *  _Toby_:  I wouldn\'t agree with your assumption.  What I wrote there is not very useful; if I\'d waited to write it by choice rather than by necessity, then I would have written rather more.

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]

  * edited and expanded the link list at [[generalized smooth space]]

  * created [[smooth infinity-stack]] -- took the liberty of declaring this to be the term for "$\infty$-stacks on CartesianSpaces" 

    * see the example there to see the relevance of this, with an eye towards the discussion at [[principal 2-bundle]] and [[principal infinity-bundle]]

  * created [[smooth space]] -- took the liberty of declaring this to be the term for "sheaves on Diff" = "sheaves on CartesianSpaces". 

    * this way a "diffeological space" is precisely a "concrete smooth space" and I 

      * edited [[diffeological space]]

      * and created [[concrete sheaf]] (but [[concrete site]] still missing, and also maybe not the best definition at [[concrete sheaf]] yet)
  
      to make this statement.

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  Created [[Cauchy sequence]] and [[complete space]], including brief references at the end of each to the relationship with [[Cauchy complete categories]].


## 2009-07-02

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]

  * started a section "concrete realizations" at [[principal infinity-bundle]]. So far I recall the old result by Quillen on certain "1-categorica topological bundles" and their $\infty$-action groupoids. Then I start making some remarks on Jardine's approach using what he calls "diagrams" and have a remark on how that compares to the Bartels-Bakovi&cacute;-etc-style. This requires eventually much more discussion, but I have to call it quits for today. 

    But the point is that Jardine works in the "petit topos" perspective where all bundles live over the fixed site. So the terminal object in his setup is not the point, but the underlying space over which one works. This means that the simple picture of a principal $\infty$-bundle as the homotopy pullback of the point no longer works and is the reason why he introduces the yoga of what he calls "diagrams".

    On the other hand, when one works with simplicial sheaves in the context of a "gros topos" such as sheaves on $Diff$ or on open subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$ or equivalent, then the simple conceptual picture remains valid. 

    Notice that placing oneself into the context of $n$-groupoids internal to diffeological spaces or the like is doing precissely this: working with simplicial sheaves on $Diff$.

    Evidently i shouldn't be discussing this here but in some entry. But it's time for me to go to bed now.


* [[Zoran Škoda]] created [[grouplike element]]. It contains few words on Amitsur complex for a coring with a (semi-)grouplike. The aim is to soon (using the setup) introduce entries for connections for corings; and then correpsondence between falt connections and descent data in the comonadic and coring setups (after Menini et al; all coming back to the example which is the correspondence between 1-order costratifications and flat connections in the crystalline setup due Grothendieck). 

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]

  * started adding the discussion of the model given by (pre)sheaves with values in _simplicial groupoids_ to [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] (contained in a new big diagram containing all Quillen equivalent models for $\infty$-sheaves)

    * in that context created [[model structure on presheaves of simplicial groupoids]]


* [[Zoran Škoda]] created [[coseparable coring]],[[Sweedler coring]], [[two dimensional sheaf theory]]; expanded [[stratifold]] (which was empty, but existing!), added a reference to [[fibration in a 2-category]] and somewhere else. I think that in K-theory delooping has a bit different multiple meanings which are related but are more procedures making from something what can not be delooped strictly in the sense of [[delooping]] to the delooping of something what is the best approximation of deloopable; there are procedures due to Quillen, Waldhausen, Karoubi etc. 

  * [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: the entry on [[two dimensional sheaf theory]] is motivated from some behind-the-scenes discussion Zoran and I are having -- Zoran rightly points out that the present characterization of [[derived stack]] may be wanting, as strictly speaking saying "derived stack" should be related to but not be regarded as equivalent to "higher stack on higher categorical site" -- what we really need eventually is more details on the Toën-Vezzosi [work](http://www.math.uiuc.edu/K-theory/0579/) on higher topos theory in the context of SSet-enriched categories, 

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]] 

  * replied at [[delooping]]


* _[[Eric]]_: Added a redirect for [[Urs]] so that he no longer has to type <nowiki>[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]</nowiki> and can simply type <nowiki>[[Urs]]</nowiki> and will be redirected to the correct page.

## 2009-07-01

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]

  * proudly presenting what is now the widest (horizontally speaking) $n$Lab entry as yet: at [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] I added a section "Map" where I draw a big diagram that indicates at least part of the collection of model structures, their interrelation, definition and authors

    *  Yeah, I was thinking of reworking that map to run vertically ....  ---Toby

    *  Would that really be better, though? Optimally, eventually we'd produce a LaTeXed pdf diagram. Here and elsewhere. That, however, inhibits joint editing a bit. ---Urs


  * replied at [[delooping]], at [[group]], added a bit at [[Notation]]

  * moved the key statement of [[Toby Bartels|Toby]]'s remark to the very beginning of [[group]] 


*  [[Toby Bartels]]:
   *  [[Andrew Stacey]] may be interested to see how I\'ve changed the formatting of the goal box at [[Froelicher space]].
   *  Incorporated Zoran\'s new references at [[principal 2-bundle]] into the text.
   *  Added a note at [[group]] how $Grp$ is a full sub-$2$-category of $Grpd_*$ (even though not of $Grpd$).

* [[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]

  * expanded at [[group]] on the statement that "a group is a groupoid with a single object"

  * added to [[loop space object]] the true definition, added also an "idea" section, links to related entries and an introductory blurb to the original material

  * created [[delooping]] for the matter discussed by [[Eric Forgy|Eric]] and [[Toby Bartels|Toby]] at [[Dijkgraaf-Witten theory]]

  * added Jardine-Luo reference to [[principal 2-bundle]] and [[principal infinity-bundle]]

  * added to [[Froelicher space]] an "Idea" and a "Reference" section, prompoted by the blog entry [here](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/07/laubinger_on_lie_algebras_for.html)

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:
   *  I archived the [[2009 June changes]] by the sneaky method of changing this page\'s name, copying the header and footer text (with appropriate changes) from the previous archive, and then creating this page anew.  Maybe that will keep us from testing Instiki\'s tolerance for pages with thousands of edits in their history.  (^_^)
   *  I\'ve completed migrating all old redirect pages to history pages; all links within the body of the Lab should now take you immediately to the target page.  (There are a few victims of a bug, but I\'ll straighten that out with Jacques.)  I have [more comments](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Vanilla/nForum/comments.php?DiscussionID=39) on the Forum.
