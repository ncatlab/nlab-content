Given a 2-category (strict 2-category or bicategory) $C$, the pseudosimplicial object in $C$ is a [[pseudofunctor]], that is a 2-functor $\Delta^{op}\to C$ in the pseudosense (associativity coherences preserved up to _invertible_ 2-cells), 
and where the category of finite ordinals and monotone maps $\Delta$ is viewed as
a 1-category or equivalently a 2-category with only trivial 2-cells. For example, we
can consider pseudosimplicial categories.
