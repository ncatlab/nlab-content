His early works were related mainly to Galois theory and number theory. 

His famous classical paper on [[Tannaka duality]] proving the original [[Tannaka-Krein theorem]] is 

* _Über den Dualitätssatz der nichtkommutativen topologischen Gruppen_, Tôhoku Math. J. 45 (1939) 1-12.

Note that this article is in the first series of Tôhoku; the current issues and the euclid archive covers just the second series. Tannaka was an editor of Tôhoku Math. J. for a longer period.

He also wrote a booklet in Japanese which treats a wider picture of dualities 

* Sôtai genri.  [The principle of duality.] Iwanami Shoten, Tokyo, 1951. v+128 pp. 

His biography has been published in Tôhoku Math. J. (see project [euclid](http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.tmj/1178228363))
