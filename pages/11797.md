## Idea

The Abel-Jacobi map refers to various homomorphisms from certain groups of [[algebraic cycles]] to some sorts of [[Jacobian]]s or generalized Jacobians. Such maps generalize the classical Abel-Jacobi map from points of a complex algebraic curve to its [[Jacobian]], which answers the question of which divisors of degree zero arise from [[meromorphic functions]].

## Definition

### for curves

Let $X$ be a smooth projective complex curve. Recall that a [[Weil divisor]] on $X$ is a formal linear combination of closed points. Classically, the Abel-Jacobi map
  $$ \alpha : \Div^0(X) \longrightarrow J(X), $$
on the group of Weil divisors of degree zero, is defined by integration. According to Abel's theorem, its kernel consists of the principal divisors, i.e. the ones coming from meromorphic functions.

### on Deligne cohomology

The cycle map to [[de Rham cohomology]] due to ([Zein-Zucker 81](#ZeinZucker81)) is discussed in ([Esnault-Viehweg 88, section 6](#EsnaultViehweg88)). The refinement to [[Deligne cohomology]] in ([Esnault-Viehweg 88, section 6](#EsnaultViehweg88)). By the characterization of [[intermediate Jacobians]] as a subgroup of the [[Deligne complex]] (see [intermediate Jacobian -- characterization as Hodge-trivial Deligne cohomology](intermediate+Jacobian#CharacterizationAsHodgeTrivialDeligneCohomology) this induces a map from cycles to [[intermediate Jacobians]]. This is the Abel-Jacobi map ([Esnault-Viehweg 88, theorem 7.11](#EsnaultViehweg88)).

### on higher Chow groups

An Abel-Jacobi map on [[higher Chow groups]] is discussed in [K-L-MS 04](#KLMS04).

### via extensions of mixed Hodge structures

An alternate construction of the Abel-Jacobi map, via [[Hodge theory]], is due to Arapura-Oh.
By a theorem of Carlson, the [[Jacobian]] is identified with the following group of [[extensions]] in the [[abelian category]] of [[mixed Hodge structures]]:
  $$ J(X) = Ext^1_{MHS}(\mathbf{Z}(-1), H^1(X, \mathbf{Z})) $$
where $\mathbf{Z}(-1)$ is the Tate Hodge structure.
Given a [[divisor]] $D$ of degree zero, one can associate to it a certain class in the above extension group.
This gives a map
  $$ \alpha : Div^0(X) \longrightarrow J(X) $$
which is called the Abel-Jacobi map.
The Abel theorem says that its [[kernel]] is precisely the subgroup of [[principal divisors]], i.e. divisors which come from invertible rational functions.
See ([Arapura-Oh, 1997](#ArapuraOh97)) for details of this construction.
