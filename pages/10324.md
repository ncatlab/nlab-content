Let $M$ be a [[smooth manifold]]. By an (embedded) **submanifold** we mean a smooth immersion of manifolds $i: X \to M$ that is a topological embedding of $X$ as a closed subspace of $M$. 

In that case, we have that for each $x \in X$, the tangent space $T_x X$ is included in the subspace $T_{i(x)} M$. We define the normal fiber $N_x$ to be the quotient $T_{i(x)} M/T_x X$ and the **normal bundle** (with respect to the embedding $i$) to be the space $N X$ consisting of pairs $\{(x, v): x \in X, v \in N_x\}$, forming a vector bundle over $X$ in an evident way. We let $i_0: X \to N X$ denote the zero section. An open neighborhood $V$ of the zero section is **convex** if its intersection with $N_x$ is a convex subset of the vector space $N_x$.

###### Theorem 
**(Tubular Neighborhood theorem)** 
For any submanifold $X$, there is an open neighborhood $U$ of $i(X)$ in $M$ and a convex open neighborhood $V$ of $i_0(X)$ in $N X$ and a diffeomorphism $\phi: U \to V$ such that the diagram 
$$\array{
X & & \\ 
\mathllap{i} \downarrow & \searrow \mathrlap{i_0} & \\ 
U & \underset{\phi}{\to} & V
}$$ 
commutes.
