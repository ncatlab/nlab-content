## Idea 

The _lexicographic order_ is a generalization of the order in which words are listed in a dictionary, according to the order of letters where the spelling of two words first differs. 

## Definition

###### Definition 
Let $\{L_i\}_{i \in I}$ be a [[well-ordered set|well-ordered]] family of [[linear order|linearly ordered sets]]. The **lexicographic order** on the [[product]] of sets $L = \prod_{i \in I} L_i$ is the [[linear order]] defined as follows: if $x, y \in L$ and $x \neq y$, then $x \lt y$ iff $x_i \lt y_i$ where $i$ is the least element in the set $\{j \in I: x_j \neq y_j\}$.

While this notion is most often seen for linear orders, it can be applied also toward more general [[relations]]. For example, one might apply the construction to sets equipped with a transitive relation $\lt$, dropping the [[linear order|trichotomy assumption]]. 

Often this notion is extended to subsets of $\prod_{i \in I} L_i$ as well. For instance, the [[free monoid]] $S^\ast$ on a linearly ordered set $S$ can be embedded in a countable power 

$$i \colon S^\ast \hookrightarrow (1 + S)^\mathbb{N} = \prod_{n \in \mathbb{N}} (1 + S)$$ 

where $1 + S$ is the result of freely adjoining a bottom element $e$ to $S$, and for each finite list $(s_1, \ldots, s_k)$ we have 

$$i(s_1, \ldots, s_k) = (s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_k, e, e, e, \ldots).$$ 

Then the lexicographic order on $S^\ast$ is the one inherited from its embedding into the lexicographically ordered set $(1 + S)^\mathbb{N}$. 

### Corecursive definition 

if $L$ is linearly ordered and the underlying set $C = L^\mathbb{N}$ is regarded as the [[terminal coalgebra]] for the functor $L \times - \colon Set \to Set$, with coalgebra structure $\langle h, t \rangle \colon C \to L \times C$, then the lexicographic order on $C$ may be defined [[corecursion|corecursively]]: 

* $c \lt c'$ if $h(c) \lt h(c')$ or ($h(c) = h(c')$ and $t(c) \lt t(c')$).
