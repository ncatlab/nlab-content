## Idea

A potential [[quantum anomaly]] in [[M-theory]]/[[type IIA string theory]].

## References
 {#References}

### General

The anomaly was found in

*  Diaconescu, [[Gregory Moore]], [[Edward Witten]], _$E_8$ Gauge Theory, and a Derivation of K-Theory from M-Theory_, Adv.Theor.Math.Phys.6:1031-1134,2003 ([arXiv:hep-th/0005090](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0005090))

while mostly assuming vanishing NS-fields (the [[B-field]]). The non-vanihshing B-field in this context was considered in 

* [[Gregory Moore]], [[Natalia Saulina]], _T-Duality, and the K-Theoretic Partition Function of TypeIIA Superstring Theory_, Nucl.Phys. B670 (2003) 27-89 ([arXiv:hep-th/0206092](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0206092))

where however the anomaly as such is not discussed. This was then put together in 

* [[Varghese Mathai]], [[Hisham Sati]], _Some Relations between Twisted K-theory and E8 Gauge Theory_, JHEP0403:016,2004 ([arXiv:hep-th/0312033](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0312033))

which hence discusses the anomaly for [[twisted K-theory]].

### Interpretaton as Orientation in second integral Morava K-theory 
 {#ReferencesInterpretationInSecondMoravaKTheory}

An interpretation of the phenomenon in terms of [[orientation in generalized cohomology|orientation]] in second [[integral Morava K-theory]] is in 

* [[Igor Kriz]], [[Hisham Sati]], _M-theory, type IIA superstrings, and elliptic cohomology_, Adv. Theor. Math. Phys. 8 (2004), no. 2, 345–394 ([Euclid](http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.atmp/1091543172), [arXiv:hep-th/0404013](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0404013))
