## Idea

For $C_\bullet$ a [[chain complex]] (of [[abelian group]]s) and $F$ a [[field]] the [[homology group]] $H_p(C,F)$ and the [[cohomology group]] $H^p(C,F)$ are related simply by dualization

$$
  H^p(C,F) \simeq Hom_F(H_p(C,F), F)
  \,.
$$

If the coefficients is not a [[field]] but an arbitrary [[abelian group]], then this relationship is more complicated and is expressed by the _universal coefficient theorem_ . 

## Statement

Let $C_\bullet$ be a [[chain complex]] of [[free construction|free]] [[abelian group]]s. Let $A$ be an arbitrary [[abelian group]]. 

Write 

* $C^\bullet := Hom_{Ab}(C_\bullet, A)$ for the dual [[cochain complex]] with respect to $A$;

* $H_n(C,\mathbb{Z})$ for the [[chain homology]] of $C$

* $H^n(C,A)$ for the [[cochain cohomology]] of $C^\bullet$.

###### Observation

There is a canonical morphism of [[abelian group]]s

$$
  \int_{(-)}(-) : H^n(C,A) \to Hom_{Ab}(H_n(C,\mathbb{Z}), A)
$$

given by sending a cocycle to evaluation of that cocycle 

$$
  [\omega] \mapsto 
   \left( [\sigma] \mapsto \int_{\sigma} \omega := \omega(\sigma) \right)
$$

###### Theorem
**(universal coefficient theorem)**

The morphism $h$ is surjective and its [[kernel]] is the [[Ext group]] $Ext^1(H_{n-1}(C, \mathbb{Z}), A)$. In other words, there is 
a [[short exact sequence]]

$$
  0 \to 
   Ext^1(H_{n-1}(C, \mathbb{Z}), A)
   \to 
   H^n(C, A) 
   \to 
   Hom(H_n(C,\mathbb{Z}), A)
   \to 
   0
  \,.
$$
