## Idea

A **Street fibration**, or **weak fibration**, is a generalization of a [[Grothendieck fibration]] which is [[non-evil]], i.e. covariant under [[equivalence of categories]].  In [[Cat]], every Street fibration is equivalent to a Grothendieck one, so the extra generality is not very useful; since it is also fairly cumbersome, it is rarely used.  However, when working with [[anafunctors]] or internally to a [[bicategory]], Street fibrations are really the only sensible notion.


## Definition

Let $p\colon E\to B$ be a [[functor]].  The notion of when a morphism of $E$ is [[cartesian morphism|cartesian]] is unchanged from the version for [[Grothendieck fibrations]].  However, now we say that $p$ is a **Street fibration** if for any $f:a\to b$ and $e\in E_b$ there exists a cartesian $\phi:e'\to e$ and an _isomorphism_ $h:p(e') \cong a$ such that $f\circ h = p(\phi)$.


### In terms of adjoint inverses

Back in the 1960s, J. Gray characterized fibrations as the functors $p\colon E\to B$ 
where for every $a \in E$ the [[slice functor]] $p/a \colon E/a \to B/p(a)$ has a [[right
adjoint]] [[right inverse]] $c_a$. One avoids evilness if one just requires that $c_a$ is
[[fully faithful functor|full and faithful]], i.e. the [[counit of the adjunction]] $p/a \dashv c_a$ is an isomorphism. Explicating this condition in elementary terms, one arrives at the above definition.


## Properties

Every Grothendieck fibration is a Street fibration, as is every [[equivalence of categories]] (the latter are not in general Grothendieck fibrations).  Conversely, every Street fibration (in Cat) is the composite of an equivalence with a Grothendieck fibration: the latter can be taken to be a [[fibrant replacement]] of it in the [[canonical model structure]] on Cat.  In fact, a Street fibration is a Grothendieck fibration precisely when it is also a [[isofibration]].

When working with Street fibrations, one must always replace [[fibers]] with [[essential fibers]].  In particular, the lifting property of a Street fibration is insufficient for a morphism $u\colon J\to I$ in $B$ to induce a functor $u^*\colon E^I\to E^J$ between strict fibers, but such a functor is induced between essential fibers.  In this way we can reconstruct a [[pseudofunctor]] $B^{op}\to Cat$ from any Street fibration, and show that the [[2-category]] of Street fibrations is equivalent to that of such pseudofunctors (though not, as in the case of Grothendieck fibrations, [[strict 2-equivalence of 2-categories|strictly 2-equivalent]]).
