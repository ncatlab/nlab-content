##Idea

A **monad transformer** is a type constructor which takes a [[monad]] as an argument and returns a monad as a result. The concept is typically treated in the literature on [[monad (in computer science)|monads in computer science]].

Monad transformers generally derive from ordinary monads and allow a modular composition, so that the action on the identity monad of the associated transform $M T$ of a monad $M$ is equivalent to $M$.

This construction is sometimes viewed (see [HP07](#HP07), [[Eff]]) as a complication resulting from passing to monads from the setting of [[Lawvere theories]], where any two theories may be naturally combined.
