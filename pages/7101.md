## Idea

For $G$ a [[topological group]] there is a notion of $G$-[[principal bundles]] $P \to X$ over any [[topological space]] $X$. Under [[continuous maps]] $f : Y \to Y$ there is a notion of [[pullback]] of principal bundles $f^* : G Bund(Y) \to G Bund(X)$.

A **universal $G$-principal bundle** is a $G$-principal bundle, which is usually written $E G \to B G$, such that for every [[CW-complex]] $X$ the map

$$
  [X, B G] \to G Bund(X)/_\sim
$$

from [[homotopy]] classes of [[continuous functions]] $X \to B G$ given by $[f] \mapsto f^* E G$, is an [[isomorphism]].

In this case one calls $B G$ a [[classifying space]] for $G$-principal bundles.

The universal principal bundle is characterized, up to equivalence, by its total space $E G$ being [[contractible]].

More generally, we can ask for a universal bundle for _numerable_ bundles, that is principal bundles which admit a trivialisation over a [[numerable]] [[open cover]]. Such a bundle exists, and classifies numerable bundles over _all_ topological spaces, not just [[paracompact]] spaces or CW-complexes.
