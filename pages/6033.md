A morphism $f:X\to Y$ is a __universal epimorphism__ if for every morphism $u : V\to Y$ there is a pullback $X\times_Y V$ and its projection $u^*(f) : X\times_Y V\to V$ is an [[epimorphism]]. 

In particular, setting $u = id_Y : Y\to Y$ we see that $f$ itself is an epimorphism.

A morphism $g: X\to Y$ is a __universal monomorphism__ if its opposite $g^\circ : Y^\circ \to X^\circ$ is a universal epimorphism in the opposite category. In particular, it is a monomorphism.
