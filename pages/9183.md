## Idea

The [[observable universe]] at large scales seems to behave as if it contains large amount of [[matter]] which does have a [[gravity|gravitational effect]] but does not emit [[electromagnetic radiation]] and hence remains "dark" to telescopes. This hypothetical matter is therefore called _dark matter_.

There are various astronomical observations that suggest the existence of dark matter

1. galaxy rotation curves -- the speed of rotation of [[galaxies]] as a function of the distance from their center cannot be explained by the observed visible matter, but an explanation of this dependence by gravitating matter requires the presence of plenty of dark matter;

1. cosmic microwave background fluctuations -- the measured fluctuations in the [[cosmic microwave background]] are very well fitted by the [[standard model of cosmology]] with cold dark matter (CDM) included. (see also [Resonaances, 18 Jan 2013](#Resonaances)).

1. Simulations of [[structure formation]] in the universe seem to require existence of dark matter in order to reproduce results compatible with observation.

Any further details about the nature of this hypothetical dark matter remain elusive to date. Possible classes of candidates go by various names. For instance "weakly interacting massive particles" ("WIMP"s), hence massive particles that interact via [[gravity]] and the [[weak nuclear force]], but not via [[electromagnetism]]. In [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] [[theory (physics)|theories]], the _lightest supersmmetric particle_ (LSP, such as the [[gravitino]] or the [[neutralino]]) is a natural candidate for dark matter ([EHNOS 84](#EHNOS84), reviewed in [Ellis-Olive 10](#EllisOlive10))

## Properties

### Cusp-core problem
 {#CuspCoreProblem}

Early numerical simulation of dark matter exhibited dark matter halos around galaxies with a sharp density maximum at the center of the galaxy -- called a "cusp" in the density profile -- while observation on actual galaxies tends to favour a noticeably smoother density distribution at the center -- called a "core" of the density profile.

This discrepancy between [[theory (physics)|theory]] and [[experiment]] is (or was) known as the _cusp-core problem_ for dark matter [[model (physics)|models]] (see the references [below](#ReferencesCoreCuspProblem)). It is (or was) one of several issues that the dark matter model has (or had) on the scale of galaxies and smaller.

There are two potential resolutions to this problem: a) Either dark matter is more "exotic" than assumed in these simulations, such as being [[fuzzy dark matter]] or similar. Or, b), more mundanely, the existing simulations do not properly resolve a subtle effect shown already by more ordinary dark matter.

Recent investigations support possibility b), indicating that the density cusps seen in previous simulations are but an artifact of overly simplified numerical models, and that would-be cusps are diluted and hence smoothed out by bursty star formation leading to dark matter heating ([Pontzen-Governato 14](#PontzenGovernato14), [Read-Walker-Steger-18](#ReadWalkerSteger18)) and/or by dynamical friction in the interstallar medium ([ESH 01](#ESH01)).


From [[Justin Read]] [22 Aug 2018](https://twitter.com/ReadDark/status/1032176578808168448) on [Read-Walker-Steger 18](#ReadWalkerSteger18):

> On large scales, the [[standard model of cosmology|standard cosmological model]] (LCDM) gives an excellent description of the [[cosmic microwave background]] [[radiation]] and the [[structure formation|growth of structure]]. However, on small scales, in our cosmic backyard known as the Local Group, there have been long-standing puzzles.  The oldest of these is the “cusp-core” problem. Gas rich dwarf galaxies have much less dark matter (DM) in their inner regions than early numerical models predicted. This could point to more exotic DM models, or to a failure of the cosmological model.

> However, there is a simpler solution. The early numerical models, above, considered a universe that contains only DM. Recent models that include gas cooling, star formation, and gas blow-out due to exploding stars find that star formation in dwarfs is bursty.

> This bursty star formation occurs due to repeated cycles of gas inflow and outflow. These cause the inner gravitational potential of the dwarf galaxy to fluctuate, kinematically "heating up" the dark matter and lowering its inner density ([Pontzen-Governato 14](#PontzenGovernato14)).

>  A key prediction of such models is that, at a fixed dark matter halo mass, more star formation leads to more dark matter "heating" and, therefore, a lower inner dark matter density, at least in dwarf galaxies. This is the prediction we set out to test in [Read-Walker-Steger 18](#ReadWalkerSteger18).

### Evidence
 {#Evidence}

Evidence for dark matter on large cosmic scales is extremely strong, see the above reviews (...). Evidence on smaller scales, starting around the scale of galaxies is problematic, see the above reviews (...). In particular, as yet there is no direct detection of any dark matter particle.

> Regardless of the formation history of NGC1052–DF2, its existence has implications for the dark matter paradigm. Our results demonstrate that dark matter is separable from galaxies, which is (under certain circumstances) expected if it is bound to baryons through nothing but gravity. The "[[bullet cluster]]" demonstrates that dark matter does not always trace the bulk of the baryonic mass, which in clusters is in the form of gas.  NGC1052–DF2 enables us to make the complementary point that dark matter does not always coincide with galaxies either:  it is a distinct "substance" that may or may not be present in a galaxy.   Furthermore,  and paradoxically, the existence of NGC1052–DF2 may falsify
alternatives to dark matter. In theories such as [[MOND]] and the recently proposed emergent gravity paradigm a "dark matter" signature should always be detected, as it is an unavoidable consequence of the presence of ordinary matter. In fact, it had been argued previously that the apparent absence of galaxies such as NGC1052–DF2 constituted a falsification of the standard cosmological model, and evidence for modified gravity.

### Axions

The observation that the "invisible [[axion]]" is a candidate for dark 
matter is due to three groups:

* {#PreskillWiseWilcek83} [[John Preskill]], M. Wise, [[Frank Wilcek]], _Cosmology of the invisible axion_, Phys. Lett. B 120:127-32 (1983)

* {#AbbottSikivie83} L.F. Abbott, P. Sikivie, _A Cosmological Bound on the Invisible Axion_, Phys.Lett. B120:133-36 (1983)

* {#DineFischler83} [[Michael Dine]], [[Willy Fischler]], _The Not So Harmless Axion_, Phys.Lett. B120:137-141 (1983)


A proposal that [[axions]] account for [[fuzzy dark matter]], and thus fix the [[WIMP]] model for dark matter with its problem of reproducing galactic rotation curves, is in
