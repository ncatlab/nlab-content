## Idea

A $V$-[[enriched category]] $C$, for $V = $ [[Grpd]] (the [[category]] of [[groupoids]]), has for every ordered pair $x,y$ of [[object]]s a [[groupoid]] $C(x,y)$ of [[morphism]]s between $x$ and $y$. This [[hom-object]] is hence a **hom-groupoid** in this case. 

For this reason such a category may be thought of as a [[locally groupoidal 2-category]], or [[(2,1)-category]].


## Examples

* For $C = $ [[Grpd]] itself, the hom-groupoids are the [[functor categories]] between two groupoids.

* For $C$ any [[small category]], the [[(2,1)-presheaf]]-category $[C^{op},Grpd]$ has as hom-groupoid $[C^{op}, Grpd](A,B)$  the groupoid of [[pseudonatural transformation]]s and [[modification]]s between the [[pseudo-functor]]s $A, B$.
