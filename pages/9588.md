## Idea

There are several [[cohomology theories]] that are being called _Morava E-theory_ at times:

* $B P\langle n\rangle$, the truncated [[Brown-Peterson spectrum]];

* $E(n)$, the [[Johnson-Wilson spectrum]], a localization of $B P \langle n\rangle$ at $v_n$;

* $\widehat{E(n)}$ the complete Johnson-Wilson spectrum

* $E(k,\Gamma)$ the [[Lubin-Tate spectrum]] associated to the universal deformation of a [[formal group law]] $\Gamma$ over $k$.

## Related concepts

* [[Morava K-theory]]

* real form: [[EO(n)]]

* [[chromatic homotopy theory]]

Not to be confused with [[C*-algebra]]-[[E-theory]].
