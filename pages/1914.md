## Definition

Given two $k$-times [[differentiable manifolds]] (or [[smooth manifolds]]), then a _diffeomorphism_ 

$$
  f
   \;\colon\;
  X 
    \longrightarrow
  Y
$$

is a [[differentiable function]]
such that there exists an [[inverse]] differentiabe function $f^{-1}$ (a function which is an [[inverse function]] on the underlying sets and is itself [[differentiable function|differentiable]] to the given degree).

Diffeomorphisms are the [[isomorphisms]] in the corrresponding [[category]] [[Diff]] of [[differentiable manifolds]]/[[smooth manifolds]].

## Properties

### Relation to homeomorphisms {#RelationHomeomorphism}

It is clear that

+-- {: .num_lemma}
###### Observation

Every diffeomorphism is in particular a [[homeomorphism]] between the underlying [[topological spaces]].

=--

The converse in general fails. There exist differentiable maps with only continuous inverse.  There are also differentiable bijections whose inverse is not even continuous.

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

The function $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ given by $x \mapsto x^3$ is a homeomorphism but not a diffeomorphism. The diffeomorphism property fails at the origin, where the differential $d f : T_0 \mathbb{R} \to T_0 \mathbb{R}$ is not onto.

=--


But there is a rich collection of theorems about cases when the converse is true after all.

###### Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the **[[open n-ball]]** $\mathbb{B}^n$ is the open subset

$$
  \mathbb{B}^n = \{ \vec x \in \mathbb{R}^n | \sum_{i = 1}^n (x^i)^2 \lt 1 \}
  \subset \mathbb{R}^n
$$

of the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ of all points of [[distance]] lower than 1 from the origin. This inherits the structure of a [[smooth manifold]] from the embedding into $\mathbb{R}^n$.

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

In [[dimension]] $d \in \mathbb{N}$ for $d \neq 4$ we have:

every open subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$ which is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{B}^d$ is also diffeomorphic to it.

###### Remark

In dimension 4 the analog statement fails due to the existence of [[exotic smooth structure]]s on $\mathbb{R}^4$.

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

For $X$ and $Y$ smooth manifolds of dimension $d = 1$, $d = 2$ or $d = 3$ we have:

if there is a homeomorphism from $X$ to $Y$, then there is also a diffeomorphism.

### Relation to homotopy equivalences
 {#RelationToHomotopyEquivalences}

For the following kinds of manifolds $\Sigma$ it is true that every [[homotopy equivalence]] 

$$
  \alpha \colon \Pi(\Sigma) \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} \Pi(\Sigma)
$$

(hence every [[equivalence of infinity-groupoids|equivalence]] of their [[fundamental infinity-groupoids]]) is [[homotopy|homotopic]] to a [[diffeomorphism]]

$$
  a \colon \Sigma \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} \Sigma
$$

i.e. that given $\alpha$ there is $a$ with

$$
  \alpha \simeq \Pi(a)
  \,.
$$


* for $\Sigma$ any [[surface]] ([Zieschang-Vogt-Coldeway](#ZieschangVogtColdeway))

* for $\Sigma$ a [[Haken 3-manifold]] ([Waldhausen](#Waldhausen68)) 

* for $\Sigma$ any  [[hyperbolic manifold]] of finite [[volume]] and of [[dimension]] $\geq 3$ (by [[Mostow rigidity theorem]]) (check)
