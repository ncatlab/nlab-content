This page will collect some technical material concerning [[colimits]] of [[normal spaces]] as computed in [[Top]]. 

The first very easy observation is that normal spaces are closed under [[coproducts]] in [[Top]] (so-called "[[disjoint union spaces]]"). 

There is no hope that normal spaces are closed under [[coequalizers]] or [[pushouts]]. A first example that comes to mind is the line with double origin, which is the topological pushout of the diagram 

$$\mathbb{R} \leftarrow \mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\} \to \mathbb{R}$$ 

where both maps are the inclusion map. This space isn't even [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]], as every [[neighborhood]] of the point $0_1$ (the image of the origin under the first pushout [[coprojection]]) intersects every neighborhood of the point $0_2$ (the image of the origin under the second coprojection). 

However, there are reasonable conditions under which pushouts will be normal. (Actually, we work with $T_4$ spaces which are normal spaces in which [[singletons]] are [[closed set|closed]]).

###### Proposition 
Let $X$ be a $T_4$ space, and suppose $q: X \to Y$ in $Top$ is a closed surjection. Then $Y$ is also $T_4$. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
First we claim singletons of $Y$ are closed: for each $y \in Y$ there exists $x \in X$ such that $y = q(x)$. Since $\{x\}$ is closed in $X$ and $q$ is closed, $\{y\} = q(\{x\})$ is closed in $Y$. 

Let $C, D$ be disjoint closed sets of $Y$, so that $\neg C, \neg D$ form an open cover of $Y$. Then $A = q^{-1}(\neg C), B = q^{-1}(\neg D)$ form an open cover of $X$. Normality of $X$ (in "[[De Morgan duality|De Morganized]]" form) implies there are closed subsets $E \subseteq A, F \subseteq B$ which together also cover $X$. Then $Y = q(X) = q(E \cup F) = q(E) \cup q(F)$, so the closed sets $q(E), q(F)$ cover $Y$. And we have $q(E) \subseteq q(A) = \neg C$ and similarly $q(F) \subseteq \neg D$, which is equivalent to $C \subseteq \neg q(E)$ and $D \subseteq \neg q(F)$, where $\neg q(E), \neg q(F)$ are disjoint open sets of $Y$, and we are done.

We know that [[compact Hausdorff spaces]] are normal spaces, and this is an especially nice class because the category of compact Hausdorff spaces is a [[pretopos]]. This is the categorical backdrop for the following observation. 

+-- {: .num_lemma #pretopos} 
###### Lemma 
Let $X$ be a compact Hausdorff space. Then an equivalence relation $\sim \hookrightarrow X \times X$ is closed as a subset of $X \times X$ iff the quotient map $q: X \to X/\sim$ is a closed map. (In which case $X/\sim$ is compact Hausdorff.) 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
If $q: X \to X/\sim$ is a closed map, making $X/\sim$ compact Hausdorff, then the diagonal $\Delta \hookrightarrow X\sim \times X/\sim$ is a closed embedding, so that its pullback along $q \times q$ 

$$\array{
\sim & \hookrightarrow & X \times X \\ 
\downarrow & & \downarrow \mathrlap{q \times q} \\ 
\Delta & \hookrightarrow & X/\sim \times X/\sim
}$$ 

also defines a closed subset of $X \times X$. 

In the other direction, suppose $\sim$ is closed, and let $A \subseteq X$ be a closed subset of $X$. Consider its $\sim$-*saturation* $\bar{A}$, namely 

$$\{x \in X: (\exists_{a \in A})\; x\sim a\} = \pi_1((\sim)\cap (X \times A)).$$ 

This is a closed set because the first projection $\pi_1$ is a closed map (by compactness of $X$). Moreover, $\bar{A} = q^{-1}(q(A))$, essentially by definition ($x \in q^{-1}(q(A))$ means $q(x) = q(a)$ for some $a \in A$). Since 
$q^{-1}(q(A))$ is closed, $q(A)$ is closed by definition of quotient topology.

###### Proposition 
Given a pushout diagram in $Top$ 

$$\array{
X & \stackrel{h}{\to} & Z \\ 
\mathllap{f} \downarrow & & \downarrow \mathrlap{g} \\ 
Y & \underset{k}{\to} & W,
}$$ 

if $h$ is [[monomorphism|monic]], $f$ is [[epimorphism|epic]], and $X, Y, Z$ are compact Hausdorff, then $g$ is closed and $W$ is compact Hausdorff. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
The kernel pair of $f$ is a closed equivalence relation $E$ on $X$ such that $f$ is the coequalizer of the first and second pullback projections $p_1, p_2: E \rightrightarrows X$. The quotient map $g: Z \to W$ is similarly the quotient of the closed equivalence relation on $Z$ formed as $(h \times h)(E) \cup \Delta_Z$. Now apply Lemma \ref{pretopos}. 
=-- 

We can push the preceding proposition a little further: 

+-- {: .num_prop} 
###### Proposition 
If $(h_i: X_i \to Z_i)_{i \in I}$ is a collection of embeddings of compact Hausdorff spaces, and $f = (f_i)_{i \in I}: \sum_{i \in I} \to Y$ is a map to a normal space, then in the pushout 

$$\array{
\sum_{i \in I} X_i & \stackrel{\sum_{i \in I} h_i}{\to} & \sum_{i \in I} Z_i \\ 
\mathllap{f} \downarrow & & \downarrow \mathrlap{g} \\ 
Y & \underset{k}{\to} & W
}$$ 

the map $g$ is closed. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
The map $f$ is closed because each $f_i$ is closed (using the fact that $X_i$ is compact Hausdorff). Similarly, the map $g$ will be closed if each of its restrictions $g_i: Z_i \to W$ is closed. But the equivalence relation given by the kernel pair of $g_i$ is $(h_i \times h_i)(E_i) \cup \Delta_{Z_i}$ where $E_i$ is the kernel pair of $f_i$, and now the result follows easily from Proposition \ref{pushoutCH}.

###### Lemma 
In $Top$, the pushout of a closed embedding along any continuous map is again a closed embedding.

A proof may be found [here](/nlab/show/subspace+topology#pushout). 

+-- {: .num_prop} 
###### Proposition 
Let $h: X \to Z$ be an embedding of compact Hausdorff spaces, and let $f: X \to Y$ be a continuous map into a Hausdorff space (e.g., a normal space). Then in the pushout in $Top$ 

$$\array{
X & \stackrel{h}{\to} & Z \\ 
\mathllap{f} \downarrow & & \downarrow \mathrlap{g} \\ 
Y & \underset{k}{\to} & W
}$$ 

the map $g$ is closed. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
Factorize $f: X \to Y$ into an epi $e: X \to K$ followed by a mono $m: K \to Y$. Then we have a composition of pushout squares in $Top$ 

$$\array{
X & \stackrel{h}{\to} & Z \\ 
\mathllap{e} \downarrow & & \downarrow \mathrlap{e'} \\ 
K & \stackrel{j}{\to} & K' \\ 
\mathllap{m} \downarrow & & \downarrow \mathrlap{m'} \\ 
Y & \underset{k}{\to} & W
}$$ 

where $K'$ is compact Hausdorff by Proposition \ref{pushoutCH}, so that $e'$ is closed. Also $m$ is a closed embedding, so $m'$ is closed by Lemma \ref{poclosed}. Hence $g = m'e'$ is closed.
