This page will collect some technical material concerning [[colimits]] of [[normal spaces]] as computed in [[Top]]. 

The first very easy observation is that normal spaces are closed under [[coproducts]] in [[Top]] (so-called "[[disjoint union spaces]]"). 

There is no hope that normal spaces are closed under [[coequalizers]] or [[pushouts]]. A first example that comes to mind is the line with double origin, which is the topological pushout of the diagram 

$$\mathbb{R} \leftarrow \mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\} \to \mathbb{R}$$ 

where both maps are the inclusion map. This space isn't even [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]], as every [[neighborhood]] of the point $0_1$ (the image of the origin under the first pushout [[coprojection]]) intersects every neighborhood of the point $0_2$ (the image of the origin under the second coprojection). 

However, there are reasonable conditions under which pushouts will be normal. (Throughout we assume all spaces are $T_1$, i.e., that [[singletons]] are [[closed set|closed]], so that "normal" means $T_4$).

###### Proposition 
Let $X$ be normal, and suppose $q: X \to Y$ in $Top$ is a closed surjection. Then $Y$ is normal. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
First we claim singletons of $Y$ are closed: for each $y \in Y$ there exists $x \in X$ such that $y = q(x)$. Since $\{x\}$ is closed in $X$ and $q$ is closed, $\{y\} = q(\{x\})$ is closed in $Y$. 

Let $C, D$ be disjoint closed sets of $Y$, so that $\neg C, \neg D$ form an open cover of $Y$. Then $A = q^{-1}(\neg C), B = q^{-1}(\neg D)$ form an open cover of $X$. Normality of $X$ (in "[[De Morgan duality|De Morganized]]" form) implies there are closed subsets $E \subseteq A, F \subseteq B$ which together also cover $X$. Then $Y = q(X) = q(E \cup F) = q(E) \cup q(F)$, so the closed sets $q(E), q(F)$ cover $Y$. And we have $q(E) \subseteq q(A) = \neg C$ and similarly $q(F) \subseteq \neg D$, which is equivalent to $C \subseteq \neg q(E)$ and $D \subseteq \neg q(F)$, where $\neg q(E), \neg q(F)$ are disjoint open sets of $Y$, and we are done.

###### Remark 
A closed surjection is a quotient map (a regular epi in $Top$), and a closed injection is an embedding (a regular mono in $Top$).

We know that [[compact Hausdorff spaces]] are normal spaces, and this is an especially nice class because the category of compact Hausdorff spaces is a [[pretopos]]. This is the categorical backdrop for the following observation. 

+-- {: .num_lemma #pretopos} 
###### Lemma 
Let $X$ be a compact Hausdorff space. Then an equivalence relation $\sim \hookrightarrow X \times X$ is closed as a subset of $X \times X$ iff the quotient map $q: X \to X/\sim$ is a closed map. (In which case $X/\sim$ is compact Hausdorff.) 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
If $q: X \to X/\sim$ is a closed map, making $X/\sim$ compact Hausdorff, then the diagonal $\Delta \hookrightarrow X\sim \times X/\sim$ is a closed embedding, so that its pullback along $q \times q$ 

$$\array{
\sim & \hookrightarrow & X \times X \\ 
\downarrow & & \downarrow \mathrlap{q \times q} \\ 
\Delta & \hookrightarrow & X/{\sim} \times X/{\sim}
}$$ 

also defines a closed subset of $X \times X$. 

In the other direction, suppose $\sim$ is closed, and let $A \subseteq X$ be a closed subset of $X$. Consider its $\sim$-*saturation* $\bar{A}$, namely 

$$\{x \in X: (\exists_{a \in A})\; x\sim a\} = \pi_1((\sim)\cap (X \times A)).$$ 

This is a closed set because the first projection $\pi_1$ is a closed map (by compactness of $X$). Moreover, $\bar{A} = q^{-1}(q(A))$, essentially by definition ($x \in q^{-1}(q(A))$ means $q(x) = q(a)$ for some $a \in A$). Since 
$q^{-1}(q(A))$ is closed, $q(A)$ is closed by definition of quotient topology.

###### Lemma 
In $Top$, the pushout of a closed embedding along any continuous map is again a closed embedding.

###### Proposition 
Given a pushout diagram in $Top$ 

$$\array{
X & \stackrel{h}{\to} & Z \\ 
\mathllap{f} \downarrow & & \downarrow \mathrlap{g} \\ 
Y & \underset{k}{\to} & W,
}$$ 

if $f, h$ are closed and $h$ is monic, then $g$ is closed. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
In the epi-(regular mono) factorization of $f$, say $X \stackrel{e}{\to} K \stackrel{m}{\to} Y$, both $e$ and $m$ are closed, and the pushout of the statement decomposes into two pushouts 

$$\array{
X & \stackrel{h}{\to} & Z \\ 
\mathllap{e} \downarrow & & \downarrow \mathrlap{e'} \\ 
K & \stackrel{j}{\to} & K' \\ 
\mathllap{m} \downarrow & & \downarrow \mathrlap{m'} \\ 
Y & \underset{k}{\to} & W
}$$ 

The map $m'$ is closed by Lemma \ref{poclosed}. The map $e$, being a closed surjection, is a quotient map (a regular epi), and thus $e'$ is also a quotient map, being a pushout of a regular epi. Then to show $e'$ is closed, it suffices to show (by definition of quotient topology) that for any closed subset $A \subseteq Z$, the saturation $(e')^{-1}(e'(A))$ is also closed. But if $e'(z) = e'(a)$ for some $a \in A$, then either $x = a$ or $(z, a) = (h(x), h(y))$ for some unique $(x, y)$ such that $e(x) = e(y)$, i.e., $x \in h(e^{-1}(e(h^{-1}(A)))$. In other words, 

$$(e')^{-1}(e'(A)) = A \cup h(e^{-1}(e(h^{-1}(A)))$$ 

where the right side is closed since $A$ is closed and $e, h$ are closed maps. Thus we have shown $m'$ and $e'$ are closed maps, and so $g = m'e'$ is also closed.

###### Proposition 
If $X, Y, Z$ are normal, and $h: X \to Z$ is a closed embedding and $f: X \to Y$ is closed, then for the pushout diagram in $Top$ 

$$\array{
X & \stackrel{h}{\to} & Z \\ 
\mathllap{f} \downarrow & & \downarrow \mathrlap{g} \\ 
Y & \underset{k}{\to} & W
}$$ 

the space $W$ is also normal. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
The space $Y + W$ is normal, so by Proposition \ref{normal}, it suffices to show that the quotient map $(k, g): Y + Z \to W$ is closed, or what is the same, that $k$ and $g$ are closed. But $k$ is closed by Lemma \ref{poclosed}, and $g$ is closed by Proposition \ref{pushoutclosed}.

+-- {: .num_cor} 
###### Corollary  
If $h: X \hookrightarrow Z$ is an embedding of compact Hausdorff spaces and $f: X \to Y$ is a map to a normal space, then the pushout $Y \cup_X Z$ is normal. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
Of course any map $f: X \to Y$ from a compact Hausdorff space to a normal (or even Hausdorff) space is closed, and so the result is immediate from Proposition \ref{pogeneral}.

###### Proposition 
If $(i_n: X_n \to X_{n+1})_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is a countable sequence of closed embeddings between normal spaces, then the colimit $X = colim_n X_n$ is also normal. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
Let $A, B$ be disjoint closed subsets of $X$, and for all $n$ put $A_n = X_n \cap A$, $B_n = X_n \cap B$. Working recursively, suppose given disjoint open sets $U_n, V_n$ such that $A_n \subseteq U_n$ and $B_n \subseteq V_n$. Since normality guarantees that we can refine further if necessary, i.e., find an open $O_n$ such that $A_n \subseteq O_n$ and $\widebar{O_n} \subseteq U_n$, we may assume that the closures $\widebar{U_n}$, $\widebar{V_n}$ are disjoint in $X_n$, as are their images in $X_{n+1}$ under the closed embedding $i_n$. The closed sets $i_n(\widebar{U_n}) \cup A_{n+1}$ and $i_n(\widebar{V_n}) \cup B_{n+1}$ are disjoint in $X_{n+1}$: 

* $A_{n+1} \cap B_{n+1} = \emptyset$ since $A \cap B = \emptyset$, 

* $i_n(\widebar{U_n}) \cap i_n(\widebar{V_n}) = i_n((\widebar{U_n} \cap \widebar{V_n}) = i_n(\emptyset) = \emptyset$ where the direct image operator $i_n(-)$ preserves binary intersections since $i_n$ is monic, 

* $i_n(\widebar{U_n}) \cap B_{n+1} = i_n(\widebar{U_n} \cap i_n^{-1}(B_{n+1})) = i_n(\widebar{U_n} \cap B_n) \subseteq i_n((\widebar{U_n} \cap \widebar{V_n}) = \emptyset$ (using Frobenius reciprocity), and similarly, 

* $A_{n+1} \cap i_n(\widebar{V_n}) = \emptyset$. 

Use normality of $X_{n+1}$ to select disjoint open sets $U_{n+1}, V_{n+1}$ such that $i_n(\widebar{U_n}) \cup A_{n+1} \subseteq U_{n+1}$ and $i_n(\widebar{V_n}) \cup B_{n+1} \subseteq V_{n+1}$, thus completing the recursive construction. 

It is clear that $i_n(U_n) \subseteq U_{n+1}$ and the union $U = colim_n U_n$ defines an open set of $X$ (by definition of colimit topology), as does $V = colim_n V_n$. The sets $U, V$ include $A, B$ respectively and are disjoint since any element they have in common must belong to $U_n$ and $V_n$ for sufficiently large $n$, which is impossible. This completes the proof.
