This page will collect some technical material concerning [[colimits]] of [[normal spaces]] as computed in [[Top]]. 

The first very easy observation is that normal spaces are closed under [[coproducts]] in [[Top]] (so-called "[[disjoint union spaces]]"). 

There is no hope that normal spaces are closed under [[coequalizers]] or [[pushouts]]. A first example that comes to mind is the line with double origin, which is the topological pushout of the diagram 

$$\mathbb{R} \leftarrow \mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\} \to \mathbb{R}$$ 

where both maps are the inclusion map. This space isn't even [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]], as every [[neighborhood]] of the point $0_1$ (the image of the origin under the first pushout [[coprojection]]) intersects every neighborhood of the point $0_2$ (the image of the origin under the second coprojection). 

However, there are reasonable conditions under which pushouts will be normal. (Throughout we assume all spaces are $T_1$, i.e., that [[singletons]] are [[closed set|closed]], so that "normal" means $T_4$).

###### Proposition 
Let $X$ be normal, and suppose $q: X \to Y$ in $Top$ is a closed surjection. Then $Y$ is normal. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
First we claim singletons of $Y$ are closed: for each $y \in Y$ there exists $x \in X$ such that $y = q(x)$. Since $\{x\}$ is closed in $X$ and $q$ is closed, $\{y\} = q(\{x\})$ is closed in $Y$. 

Let $C, D$ be disjoint closed sets of $Y$, so that $\neg C, \neg D$ form an open cover of $Y$. Then $A = q^{-1}(\neg C), B = q^{-1}(\neg D)$ form an open cover of $X$. Normality of $X$ (in "[[De Morgan duality|De Morganized]]" form) implies there are closed subsets $E \subseteq A, F \subseteq B$ which together also cover $X$. Then $Y = q(X) = q(E \cup F) = q(E) \cup q(F)$, so the closed sets $q(E), q(F)$ cover $Y$. And we have $q(E) \subseteq q(A) = \neg C$ and similarly $q(F) \subseteq \neg D$, which is equivalent to $C \subseteq \neg q(E)$ and $D \subseteq \neg q(F)$, where $\neg q(E), \neg q(F)$ are disjoint open sets of $Y$, and we are done.

We know that [[compact Hausdorff spaces]] are normal spaces, and this is an especially nice class because the category of compact Hausdorff spaces is a [[pretopos]]. This is the categorical backdrop for the following observation. 

+-- {: .num_lemma #pretopos} 
###### Lemma 
Let $X$ be a compact Hausdorff space. Then an equivalence relation $\sim \hookrightarrow X \times X$ is closed as a subset of $X \times X$ iff the quotient map $q: X \to X/\sim$ is a closed map. (In which case $X/\sim$ is compact Hausdorff.) 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
If $q: X \to X/\sim$ is a closed map, making $X/\sim$ compact Hausdorff, then the diagonal $\Delta \hookrightarrow X\sim \times X/\sim$ is a closed embedding, so that its pullback along $q \times q$ 

$$\array{
\sim & \hookrightarrow & X \times X \\ 
\downarrow & & \downarrow \mathrlap{q \times q} \\ 
\Delta & \hookrightarrow & X/{\sim} \times X/{\sim}
}$$ 

also defines a closed subset of $X \times X$. 

In the other direction, suppose $\sim$ is closed, and let $A \subseteq X$ be a closed subset of $X$. Consider its $\sim$-*saturation* $\bar{A}$, namely 

$$\{x \in X: (\exists_{a \in A})\; x\sim a\} = \pi_1((\sim)\cap (X \times A)).$$ 

This is a closed set because the first projection $\pi_1$ is a closed map (by compactness of $X$). Moreover, $\bar{A} = q^{-1}(q(A))$, essentially by definition ($x \in q^{-1}(q(A))$ means $q(x) = q(a)$ for some $a \in A$). Since 
$q^{-1}(q(A))$ is closed, $q(A)$ is closed by definition of quotient topology.

###### Lemma 
In $Top$, the pushout of a closed embedding along any continuous map is again a closed embedding.

A proof may be found [here](/nlab/show/subspace+topology#pushout). 


+-- {: .num_prop #pushoutCH} 
###### Proposition 
Given a pushout diagram in $Top$ 

$$\array{
X & \stackrel{h}{\to} & Z \\ 
\mathllap{f} \downarrow & & \downarrow \mathrlap{g} \\ 
Y & \underset{k}{\to} & W,
}$$ 

if $h$ is [[monomorphism|monic]], $Y$ is Hausdorff, and $X, Z$ are compact Hausdorff, then $g$ is closed. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
In the epi-(regular mono) factorization of $f$, say $X \stackrel{e}{\to} K \stackrel{m}{\to} Y$, both $e$ and $m$ are closed, and the pushout of the statement decomposes into two pushouts 

$$\array{
X & \stackrel{h}{\to} & Z \\ 
\mathllap{e} \downarrow & & \downarrow \mathrlap{e'} \\ 
K & \stackrel{j}{\to} & K' \\ 
\mathllap{m} \downarrow & & \downarrow \mathrlap{m'} \\ 
Y & \underset{k}{\to} & W
}$$ 

The kernel pair of $e$ is a closed equivalence relation $E$ on $X$ such that $e$ is the coequalizer of the first and second pullback projections $p_1, p_2: E \rightrightarrows X$. The coequalizer $e': Z \to K'$ is similarly the quotient of the closed equivalence relation on $Z$ formed as $(h \times h)(E) \cup \Delta_Z$. Now apply Lemma \ref{pretopos} to conclude $e'$ is closed, and apply Lemma \ref{poclosed} to conclude $m'$ is closed. Hence $g = m' e'$ is closed.

We can push the preceding proposition a little further: 

+-- {: .num_prop #pogeneral} 
###### Proposition 
If $(h_i: X_i \to Z_i)_{i \in I}$ is a collection of embeddings of compact Hausdorff spaces, and $f = (f_i)_{i \in I}: \sum_{i \in I} X_i \to Y$ is a map to a Hausdorff space, then in the pushout 

$$\array{
\sum_{i \in I} X_i & \stackrel{\sum_{i \in I} h_i}{\to} & \sum_{i \in I} Z_i \\ 
\mathllap{f} \downarrow & & \downarrow \mathrlap{g} \\ 
Y & \underset{k}{\to} & W
}$$ 

the map $g$ is closed.

###### Theorem 
Let $Y$ be normal, and let $h_i: X_i \hookrightarrow Z_i$ be a collection of embeddings of compact Hausdorff spaces. Denote the map $\sum_{i \in I} h_i: \sum_{i \in I} X_i \to \sum_{i \in I} Z_i$ by $h: X \to Z$. Then for any continuous map $f: X \to Y$, the pushout $Y \cup_X Z$ is normal. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
$Y$ and $Z = \sum_{i \in I} Z_i$, and therefore also $Y + Z$, are normal, and so by Proposition \ref{normal} it suffices to show that the quotient map $Y + Z \to Y \cup_X Z$ is closed, or equivalently that the coprojections $k: Y \to Y \cup_X Z$ and $g: Z \to Y \cup_X Z$ in the pushout diagram 

$$\array{
X & \stackrel{h}{\to} & Z \\ 
\mathllap{f} \downarrow & & \downarrow \mathrlap{g} \\ 
Y & \underset{k}{\to} & Y \cup_X Z
}$$ 

are closed. But $k$ is closed by Lemma \ref{poclosed}, and $g$ is closed by Proposition \ref{pogeneral}.
