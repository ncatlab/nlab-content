## Idea

A _regular category_ is a [[finitely complete category]] which admits a good notion of [[image]] factorization. A primary _raison d'etre_ behind regular categories $C$ is to have a decently behaved _calculus of [[relation]]s_ in $C$.  Regular categories are also the natural setting for [[internal logic|regular logic]].


## Definition

A category $C$ is **regular** if 

* It is [[finitely complete category|finitely complete]]; 

* The [[kernel pair]] $p_1, p_2: e \,\rightrightarrows\, d$ of any $f: d \to c$ admits a [[coequalizer]];  and

* The [[pullback]] of a [[regular epimorphism]] along any morphism is again a regular epimorphism.

Here the "kernel pair" is the parallel pair of projection maps coming out of a pullback $e$ of the diagram 

$$d \stackrel{f}{\to} c \stackrel{f}{\leftarrow} d$$

The kernel pair is always an [[congruence]] on $d$ in $C$; informally, $\ker(f)$ is the subobject of $d \times d$ consisting of pairs of elements which have the same value under $f$ (sometimes called the 'kernel' of a function in $\Set$). The coequalizer above is supposed to be the "object of equivalence classes" of $\ker(f)$ as an internal [[equivalence relation]].

A map which is the coequalizer of a parallel pair of morphisms is called a _[[regular epimorphism]]_. In fact, in any category satisfying the first two conditions above, every coequalizer is the coequalizer of its kernel pair. (See for instance Lemma 5.6.6 in _[[Practical Foundations]]_.)

The last condition may equivalently be stated in the form "coequalizers of kernel pairs are stable under pullback". However, it is not generally true in a regular category that the pullback of a general coequalizer diagram 

$$e \;\rightrightarrows\; d \to c$$ 

along a morphism $c' \to c$ is again a coequalizer diagram (nor need a regular category have coequalizers of all parallel pairs).

To form the image factorization of a map $f: d \to c$, let $q: d \to k$ be the coequalizer of the kernel pair of $f$. Since $f$ coequalizes its kernel pair, there is a unique map $i: k \to c$ such that $f = i q$. It may be shown from the regular category axioms that $i$ is monic and in fact represents the [[image]] of $f$, i.e., the smallest subobject through which $f$ factors.  Moreover, the classes of regular epis and of (all) monomorphisms form a [[orthogonal factorization system|factorization system]].

In fact, a regular category can alternately be defined as a finitely complete category with pullback-stable [[image]] factorizations.  See [[familial regularity and exactness]] for a generalization of this approach to include [[coherent category|coherent]] categories as well.


## Examples

* [[Set]] is a regular category. In fact, any [[topos]] is regular. More generally, a locally cartesian closed category with coequalizers is regular, and so any quasitopos is regular. 

* The category of models of any finitary algebraic theory (i.e., [[Lawvere theory]]) $T$ is regular. This applies in particular to the category [[Ab]] of abelian groups. 

* Any [[abelian category]] is regular. 

* If $C$ is regular, then so is $C^D$ for any category $D$. 

Examples of categories which are _not_ regular include [[Cat]], [[Pos]], and [[Top]]. 


## Stronger conditions

### Exactness

If a regular category additionally has the property that every [[congruence]] is a kernel pair (and hence has a quotient), then it is called a (Barr-) [[exact category]].  Note that while regularity implies the existence of some coequalizers, and exactness implies the existence of more, an exact category need not have all coequalizers (only coequalizers of congruences), whereas a regular category can be [[cocomplete category|cocomplete]] without being exact.

Regularity and exactness can also be phrased in the language of [[Galois connection]]s.  For each object $d$, consider the following relation $coeq$ between the class of parallel pairs $f, g: e \stackrel{\to}{\to} d$) and maps $h: d \to c$: 

$$\langle (f, g); h \rangle \in coeq \qquad iff \qquad h f = h g$$

[to be continued...]


### Higher arity

As exactness properties go, the ones possessed by general regular categories are fairly moderate; the main condition is of course stability of regular epis under pullback.  A natural generalization is to include (finite or infinite) unions of subobjects, or equivalently images of (finite or infinite) families as well as of single morphisms.  This leads to the notion of [[coherent category]].

Just as regularity implies the existence of certain coequalizers, coherence implies the existence of certain [[coproducts]] and [[pushouts]], but not all.  A [[lextensive category]] has all (finite or infinite) coproducts that are disjoint and stable under pullback.  It is easy to see that a lextensive regular category must actually be coherent.


## The regular topology

Any regular category $C$ admits a [[subcanonical site|subcanonical]] [[Grothendieck topology]] whose covering families are generated by single [[regular epimorphisms]].  If $C$ is [[exact category|exact]] or has pullback-stable [[reflexive coequalizer]]s, then its [[codomain fibration]] is a [[stack]] for this topology (the necessary and sufficient condition is that any pullback of a kernel pair is again a kernel pair).


## Making categories regular

Any category $C$ with [[finite limits]] has a **reg/lex completion** $C_{reg/lex}$ with the following properties:

* There is a [[full and faithful functor]] $C\hookrightarrow C_{reg/lex}$
* Each object of $C$ becomes [[projective object|projective]] in $C_{reg/lex}$
* Each left-exact functor $C\to D$, where $D$ is regular, extends to an essentially unique regular functor $C_{reg/lex}\to D$.

In particular, the reg/lex completion is a left adjoint to the [[forgetful functor]] from regular categories to lex categories (categories with finite limits).  The reg/lex completion can be obtained by "formally adding images" for all morphisms in $C$, or by "closing up" $C$ under images in its [[presheaf category]] $[C^{op},Set]$; see [[regular and exact completions]].  In general, even if $C$ is regular, $C_{reg/lex}$ is larger than $C$ (that is, it is a [[free cocompletion]] rather than merely a [[completion]]), although if $C$ satisfies the [[axiom of choice]] (in the sense that all [[regular epimorphisms]] are split), then $C\simeq C_{reg/lex}$.

Regular categories of the form $C_{reg/lex}$ for a lex category $C$ can be characterized as those regular categories in which every object admits both a regular epi from a projective object and a monomorphism into a projective object, and the projective objects are closed under finite limits.  In this case $C$ can be recovered as the subcategory of projective objects.  In fact, the construction of $C_{reg/lex}$ can be extended to categories having only [[weak finite limits]], and the regular categories of the form $C_{reg/lex}$ for a "weakly lex" category $C$ are those satisfying the first two conditions but not the third.

When the reg/lex completion is followed by the [[ex/reg completion]] which completes a regular category into an [[exact category|exact one]], the result is unsurprisingly the [[ex/lex completion]].  See [[regular and exact completions]] for more about all of these operations.

Knop's condition for regularity is slightly different from that presented here; he works with categories that when augmented by an absolutely initial object are regular in the terminology here.  In the paper, Knop generalizes a construction of Deligne by showing how to construct a symmetric pseudo-abelian [[tensor category]] out of a regular category through the calculus of relations.
