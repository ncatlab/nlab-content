## Idea

A [[subobject]] of [[dimension]] $k$ inside an [[object]] of dimension $d$ is said to have _codimension_ $d-k$.

## Examples

* A [[submanifold]] of dimension 3 inside a manifold of dimension 5 has codimension 5-3.

* In [[algebraic geometry]] a [[subvariety]] of codimension 1 is called a _[[divisor (algebraic geometry)]]_.
