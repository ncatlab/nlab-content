[[Barr]] proved a theorem about embedding [[regular categories]] into categories of [[small presheaves]], and also a strengthening for [[Barr exact categories]].

## Idea  

Barr's embedding theorem has the classical form of many embedding[^note] theorems in mathematics: if a structure $\mathcal{C}$ has certain good properties, then it admits an embedding with certain other good properties into another structure $\mathcal{D}$ which is somehow more explicit than $\mathcal{C}$.

[^note]: In category theory, an _embedding_ usually means a functor which is _injective on morphisms_. (This obviously implies both [[faithful]] and _injective on objects_.) 

For example, 


* by Tychonoff's embedding theorem, if a $T_0$ space $X$ is [[completely regular]], then there exists an embedding of $X$ into a product of [[metric space]]s

* by the [[Whitney embedding theorem]], if an abstract $d$-dimensional real manifold $M$ is smooth, then there exists an embedding, which is an [[embedding of smooth manifolds]], of $M$ into the explicit real manifold that is $\mathbb{R}^{2d}$

* by the [[Freyd-Mitchell embedding theorem]], if a category is [[small]] and [[abelian category|abelian]], then there exist an embedding, which is [[exact functor|exact]], into the category of modules of a (not necessarily commutative) [[ring]]. 

and, 

* by Barr's embedding theorem, if a category is [[small]] and [[regular category|regular]], then there exists an [[embedding]], which is a full, faithful and [[regular functor|regular]], into a category of [[presheaves]] over some [[small category]]. 


## A proof of Makkai

The proof of (a version of) Barr's theorem given by Makkai in [Makkai1980](#Makkai80) is a nice example of a non-trivial application of [[ultraproduct]]s in category theory.

One can also consider categories enriched over a locally finitely presentable closed symmetric monoidal category $V$. Such a $V$-category $C$ is regular if it is finitely complete, admits the coequalizers of kernel pairs all [[regular epimorphism]]s are universal (i.e. stable under pullbacks) and stable under cotensors with the finite objects. A $V$-functor is regular if it preserves finite limits and regular epimorphisms. The following generalizes the Barr's embedding theorem for regular categories to the regular enriched categories:
