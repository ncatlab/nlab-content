## Idea

In [[linear algebra]] a _projector_ is a [[linear map]] $e \colon V \to V$ that "squares to itself" in that its [[composition]] with itself is again itself: $e \circ e = e$. 

A projector $e$ leads to a decomposition of the [[vector space]] $V$ that it acts on into a [[direct sum]] of its [[kernel]] and its [[image]]:

$$
  V \simeq ker(e) \oplus im(e)
  \,.
$$

The notion of projector is the special case of that of [[idempotent]] [[morphism]].
