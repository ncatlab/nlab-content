## Idea

In [[homotopy theory]], the _cone_ of a space $X$ is the space got by taking the $X$-shaped [[cylinder object|cylinder]] $X \times I$, where $I$ may be an [[interval object]], and squashing one end down to a point.  The eponymous example is where $X$ is the circle, i.e. the topological space $S^1$, and $I$ is the interval $[0,1]$.  Then the [[cartesian product]] $X \times I$ really is a cylinder, and the cone of $X$ is likewise a cone.

This notion also makes sense when $X$ is a [[category]], if $I$ is taken to be the [[interval category]] $\{ 0 \to 1 \}$, i.e. the [[ordinal]] $\mathbf{2}$.  Note that since the interval category is directed, this gives two different kinds of cone, depending on which end we squash down to a point.

Another, perhaps more common, meaning of 'cone' in category theory is that of a _cone over (or under) a [[diagram]]_.  This is just a [[diagram]] over cone category, as above.  Explicitly, a cone over $F\colon J \to C$ is an [[object]] $c$ in $C$ equipped with a [[morphism]] from $c$ to each vertex of $F$, such that every *new* triangle arising in this way [[commutative triangle|commutes]].  A cone which is [[universal property|universal]] is a [[limit]].

In category theory, the word _[[cocone]]_ is sometimes used for the case when we squash the other end of the interval; thus $c$ is equipped with a morphism *to* $c$ *from* each vertex of $F$ (but $c$ itself still belongs to $C$).  A cocone in this sense which is universal is a [[colimit]].  However, one should beware that in homotopy theory, the word [[mapping cocone|cocone]] is used for a different dualization.

This definition generalizes to [[higher category theory]]. In particular in [[(∞,1)-category theory]] a cone over an [[∞-groupoid]] is essentially a cone in the sense of [[homotopy theory]].


## Definition

### In homotopy theory

If $X$ is a space, then the cone of $X$ is the [[homotopy pushout]]
of the identity on $X$ along the unique map to the point:

$$
\array{
  X & \to & X \\
  \downarrow & & \downarrow \\
  * & \to & cone(X)
}\,.
$$

This homotopy pushout can be computed as the ordinary [[pushout]] $cone(X) := X\times I \amalg_X *$

$$
  \array{
    X &\stackrel{d_1}{\to} & X \times I
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    * &\to& cone(X)
  }
  \,.
$$

If $X$ is a [[simplicial set]], then the cone of $X$ is the [[join of simplicial sets|join]] of $X$ with the point.

The [[mapping cone]] (q.v.) of a morphism $f \colon X \to Y$ is then the pushout along $f$ of the inclusion $X \to cone(X)$.


### In category theory

If $C$ is a category, then the cone of $C$ is the [[cocomma category]] of the identity on $C$ and the unique map to the terminal category:

$$
\array{
  C & \to & C \\
  \downarrow & \Rightarrow  & \downarrow \\
  * & \to & cone(C)
}\,.
$$

Again, this may be computed as a pushout:

$$
  \array{
    C &\stackrel{d_1}{\to} & C \times \mathbf{2}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    * &\to& cone(C)
  }
  \,.
$$

The cone of $C$ may equivalently be thought of, or defined, as the result of adjoining a new [[initial object]] to $C$.

### Cones over a diagram

A cone *in* a category $C$ is given by a category $J$ together with a [[functor]] $cone(J) \to C$.  By the [[universal property]] of the cocomma category, to give such a functor is to give an object $c$ of $C$, a functor $F \colon J \to C$, and a [[natural transformation]]
$$T: \Delta(c) \to F$$ 
where $\Delta(c):J\to C$ denotes the [[constant functor]] at the object $c$.  Such a transformation is called a _cone over the diagram_ $F$.

In other words, a cone consists of morphisms (called the **components** of the cone) 

$$T_j: c \to F(j),$$

one for each object $j$ of $J$, which are compatible with all the morphisms $F(f): F(j) \to F(k)$ of the diagram, in the sense that each diagram 
$$\array{
{}&{}&c&{}&{} \\
{}& \mathllap{\scriptsize{T_j}}\swarrow &{}& \searrow\mathrlap{\scriptsize{T_k}} &{}  \\
F(j) &{}&\stackrel{F(f)}{\longrightarrow} &{}& F(k) \\
}
$$
commutes.

It's called a cone because one pictures $c$ as sitting at the vertex, and the diagram itself as forming the base of the cone. 

A [[cocone]] in $C$ is precisely a cone in the [[opposite category]] $C^{op}$.


### Over a diagram in an $(\infty,1)$-category

For $F : D \to C$ a [[diagram]] of [[(∞,1)-categories]], i.e. an [[(∞,1)-functor]], the $(\infty,1)$-category of $(\infty,1)$-cones over $F$ is the [[over quasi-category]] denoted $C_{/F}$. Its objects are cones over $F$. Its [[k-morphism]]s are $k$-homotopies between cones. The [[limit in a quasi-category|(∞,1)-categorical limit]] over $F$ is, if it exists, the [[initial object]] in $C_{/F}$.
