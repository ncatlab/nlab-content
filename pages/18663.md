## Definition

An **adjoint string of length $n$**, or an **adjoint $n$-tuple**, is a sequence of $(n-1)$ [[adjunctions]] between $n$ [[functors]] (or more generally [[morphisms]] in a [[2-category]]):

$$f_1 \dashv f_2 \dashv \cdots \dashv f_n $$

## Special cases

* An adjoint $2$-tuple is just an ordinary [[adjunction]].
* An adjoint $3$-tuple is an [[adjoint triple]].
* An adjoint $4$-tuple is an [[adjoint quadruple]].

##Examples

* There is an adjoint $5$-tuple between $[Set^{op}, Set]$ and $Set$. Indeed, given a small category $B$, and the [[Yoneda embedding]], $y: B \to [B^{op}, Set]$, then $y$ being the rightmost functor of an adjoint $5$-tuple entails that $B$ is equivalent to [[Set]].

* There is an adjoint $7$-tuple between any [[pointed category]] with pullbacks and pushouts (where the kernel of a morphism $A \to B$ is the pullback of $A\to B \leftarrow 0$, and dually for the cokernel) and its [[arrow category]]. The functor sending an object to its identity morphism has a string of three adjoints on either side.

* In every [[derivator]] there is an adjoint $5$-tuple which may extended to a $7$-tuple in a [[pointed derivator]]. In a stable setting this may be extended further to a doubly infinite string with period 6 ([GrothShul17](#GrothShul17)).

* Let $[n]$ denote the totally ordered $(n+1)$-element set, regarded as a category. For each positive integer $n$, we have $n+1$ order-preserving injections from $[n-1]$ to $[n]$, and $n$ order-preserving surjections from $[n]$ to $[n-1]$. Regarded as functors, these injections and surjections interleave to form an adjoint chain of length $2n$.
