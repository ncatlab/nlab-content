##Idea
A **scattered topos** is the topos-theoretic analogue of a [[scattered space|scattered topological space]] and therefore provides a natural environment for an internal interpretation of [[provability logic]].

##Definition
A topos $\mathcal{E}$ is called $\bot\negthinspace$-scattered if the subtopos $Sh_{\neg\neg}(\mathcal{E})$ of [[double negation|double negation sheaves]] is an [[open subtopos]].

A topos $\mathcal{E}$ is called _scattered_ if every [[closed subtopos]] of $\mathcal{E}$ is $\bot$-scattered.

##Examples

Every [[Boolean topos]] $\mathcal{E}$ is $\bot$-scattered since it obviously coincides with $Sh_{\neg\neg}(\mathcal{E})$ and is [[open subtopos|open]] in itself (and [[closed subtopos|closed]] as well). Accordingly, $\mathcal{E}$ is scattered since subtoposes of Boolean toposes are Boolean.

A simple example of a non-Boolean scattered topos is the [[Sierpinski topos]] $Set^\rightarrow$ that consists of two copies of $Set$ [[Artin gluing|glued]] together such that one copy corresponding to $Sh_{\neg\neg}(Set^\rightarrow)$ is open and the other one is closed. Since $Set^\rightarrow$ and the closed copy of $Set$ are both $\bot$-scattered the claim follows.
