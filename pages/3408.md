## Definition

__$Bool Alg$__ is the [[category]] whose [[objects]] are [[boolean algebras]] and whose [[morphisms]] are lattice [[homomorphisms]], that is [[functions]] which preserve finitary [[meets]] and [[joins]] (equivalently, binary meets and joins and the [[top]] and [[bottom]] elements); it follows that the homomorphisms preserve [[negation]].  $Bool Alg$ is a [[subcategory]] of [[Pos]], in fact a [[replete subcategory]] of both [[DistLat]] and [[HeytAlg]].

$Bool Alg$ is given by a finitary [[variety of algebras]], or equivalently by a [[Lawvere theory]], so it has all the usual properties of such categories. 


## The Lawvere theory

The Lawvere theory is the category opposite to the category of finitely generated free Boolean algebras. The free Boolean algebra $Bool(X)$ generated by a finite set $X$ is isomorphic to the _double [[power set]]_ $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{P}X$ of $X$; an element $a$ of $X$ is interpreted as the set of all those [[subsets]] of $X$ to which $a$ belongs, and the boolean algebra operations on the [[intersection]] and [[union]] as usual.


## Free Boolean algebras 

The __free Boolean algebra__ on an infinite set $X$ can be described in several ways. By abstract nonsense, it can be described as a filtered colimit of finitely generated free Boolean algebras

$$Bool(X) = colim_{fin. S \subseteq X} Bool(S)$$ 

in the category of Boolean algebras; here the colimit is over the directed system of finite subsets and inclusions between them. 

A second, more concrete description is 

$$Bool(X) = \mathcal{P}_{fin} \mathcal{P}_{fin} X$$ 

where $\mathcal{P}_{fin}(X)$ denotes the set of [[Dedekind finite set|Dedekind finite]] [[subset]]s of $X$. However, the Boolean operations are not what one might naively expect. The simplest way of describing the operations might be to consider Boolean algebras as equivalent to [[Boolean ring]]s (where binary addition is given by symmetric difference), and consider the construction of free Boolean rings by analogy with polynomial algebra constructions, where one forms the free vector space generated by a monoid of monomials. 

Thus, in the first place, the monoid $M = \mathcal{P}_{fin} X$ (where the multiplication is given by intersection) can be seen as the free commutative idempotent monoid on $X$. In the second place, 

$$Bool(S) = \mathcal{P}_{fin} M$$ 

is seen as the free $\mathbb{Z}_2$-vector space on $M$, where binary addition is given by symmetric difference of two finite subsets of $M$. The multiplication on $Bool(S)$ is inherited from multiplication on $M$, with the help of the distributive law. 

(The naive prescription, where one uses the usual intersection and union on the Boolean algebra $\mathcal{P} |M|$, is guaranteed to fail because this is an atomic Boolean algebra, whereas the free Boolean algebra on an infinite set $X$ is atomless.) 

A third description comes from Stone duality (see below). 


## Stone duality 

Classical Stone duality comes about as follows. The two-element Boolean algebra $\mathbf{2}$ can be regarded as a Boolean algebra object in the category of compact Hausdorff spaces $CH$. Thus, for each finitary Boolean algebra operation $\theta: \mathbf{2}^n \to \mathbf{2}$, there is a corresponding operation on the representable functor $CH(-, \mathbf{2}): CH^{op} \to Set$ given by 

$$CH(-, \mathbf{2})^n \cong CH(-, \mathbf{2}^n) \stackrel{CH(-, \theta)}{\to} CH(-, \mathbf{2})$$ 

and therefore we obtain a lift 

$$CH(-, \mathbf{2}): CH^{op} \to BoolAlg$$ 

A _Stone space_ is by definition a totally disconnected compact Hausdorff space. Let $Stone \hookrightarrow CH$ denote the full subcategory of Stone spaces.

###### Theorem (Stone representation)

The representable functor restricts to an equivalence $Stone^{op} \to Bool$. 
=-- 

This important theorem can be exploited to give a third description of the free Boolean algebra on a set $X$: 

$$Bool(X) \cong CH(2^X, \mathbf{2})$$ 

where $2$ denotes the 2-element compact Hausdorff space, and $2^X$ the product space $\prod_X 2$. Indeed, the inverse equivalence 

$$Bool^{op} \to Stone$$ 

takes a Boolean algebra $B$ to its [[spectrum]], i.e., the space of Boolean algebra maps $Bool(B, 2)$ (_this_ $2$ is the two-element Boolean algebra $\mathbb{Z}_2$!) equipped with the [[Zariski topology]]. Applied to $B = Bool(X)$, we have 

$$Bool(B, 2) \cong Set(X, 2) = 2^X$$ 

where the Zariski topology coincides with the product topology on $2^X$. By the equivalence, we therefore retrieve $Bool(X)$ as $CH(2^X, \mathbf{2})$. 
This in turn is identified with the Boolean algebra of clopen subsets of [[Cantor space]] $2^X$.  

## In constructive mathematics
 
In [[constructive mathematics]], we do not use the entire power set but instead use (both times) only the [[decidable subsets]] of $X$.  Thus, the free boolean algebra on $X$ is $\mathcal{P}_{dec}\mathcal{P}_{dec}X$, which may more simply be written as $2^{2^X}$ (which is also a good notation classically).  In [[predicative mathematics]], the same argument shows that the free boolean algebra exists if we allow [[function sets]], although even this is not allowed in strongly predicative foundations.
