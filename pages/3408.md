__$Bool Alg$__ is the [[category]] whose [[objects]] are [[boolean algebras]] and whose [[morphisms]] are lattice [[homomorphisms]], that is [[functions]] which preserve finitary [[meets]] and [[joins]] (equivalently, binary meets and joins and the [[top]] and [[bottom]] elements); it follows that the homomorphisms preserve [[negation]].  $Bool Alg$ is a [[subcategory]] of [[Pos]], in fact a [[replete subcategory]] of both [[DistLat]] and [[HeytAlg]].

$Bool Alg$ is given by a finitary [[variety of algebras]], or equivalently by a [[Lawvere theory]], so it has all the usual properties of such categories.  The __[[free object|free]] boolean algebra__ on a [[set]] $X$ is the __double [[power set]]__ $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{P}X$ of $X$; an element $a$ of $X$ is interpreted as the set of all those [[subsets]] of $X$ to which $a$ belongs, and the boolean algebra operations on the [[intersection]] and [[union]] as usual.

In [[constructive mathematics]], we do not use the entire power set but instead use (both times) only the [[decidable subsets]] of $X$.  Thus, the free boolean algebra on $X$ is $\mathcal{P}_{dec}\mathcal{P}_{dec}X$, which may more simply be written as $2^{2^X}$ (which is also a good notation classically).  In [[predicative mathematics]], the same argument shows that the free boolean algebra exists if we allow [[function sets]], although even this is not allowed in strongly predicative foundations.
