A semigroup is like a [[monoid]] where there might not be an [[identity element]].  In other words, a __semigroup__ is a set equipped with an associative binary operation.  Equivalently, we may define a semigroup to be an associative [[magma]].

Some semigroups happen to be monoids; even then, a semigroup homomorphism might not be a monoid homomorphism (because it might not preserve the identity element).  Nevertheless, semigroup [[isomorphisms]] must be monoid isomorphisms.  Thus, the identity element of a monoid forms a [[property-like structure]] on the underlying semigroup.

As a monoid is a [[category]] with one object, so a semigroup is a [[semicategory]] with one object.

Some mathematicians consider semigroups to be a case of [[centipede mathematics]].  [[category theory|Category theorists]] sometimes look with scorn on semigroups, because unlike a monoid, a semigroup is not an example of a [[category]].    

However, a semigroup can be promoted to a monoid by adjoining a new element and decreeing it to be the identity.  This gives a [[full and faithful functor]] from the category of semigroups to the category of monoids.  So, a semigroup can actually be seen as a monoid with an extra property.

On the other hand, analysts run across semigroups often in the wild, and don\'t always want to add formal identities just to turn them into monoids.


Another variant with strong links with category theory is that of [[inverse semigroups]], which [[Charles Ehresmann]] showed were closely related to [[ordered groupoid]]s. Inverse semigroups naturally occur when considering partial symmetries of an object.

# Internalization #

We can [[internalization|internalize]] the concept of semigroup in any [[monoidal category]] (or even [[multicategory]]) $V$ to get a __semigroup object__ in $V$.
