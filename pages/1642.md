## Definition

A semigroup is like a [[monoid]] where there might not be an [[identity element]].  

Precisely, a __semigroup__ is, equivalently,

*  a [[set]] equipped with an [[associativity|associative]] binary operation.  

* an associative [[magma]];

* the [[hom-set]] of a [[semicategory]] with a single object.


## Properties

Some semigroups happen to be [[monoid]]s; even then, a semigroup [[homomorphism]] might not be a monoid homomorphism (because it might not preserve the identity element).  Nevertheless, semigroup [[isomorphisms]] must be monoid isomorphisms.  Thus, the identity element of a monoid forms a [[property-like structure]] on the underlying semigroup.

As a monoid is a [[category]] with one object, so a semigroup is a [[semicategory]] with one object.


## Attitudes Toward Semigroups 

Some mathematicians consider semigroups to be a case of [[centipede mathematics]].  [[category theory|Category theorists]] sometimes look with scorn on semigroups, because unlike a monoid, a semigroup is not an example of a [[category]].    

However, a semigroup can be promoted to a monoid by adjoining a new element and decreeing it to be the identity.  This gives a [[full and faithful functor]] from the category of semigroups to the category of monoids.  So, a semigroup can actually be seen as a monoid with an extra property.

###### Exercise  

What is this property?

On the other hand, analysts run across semigroups often in the wild, and don\'t always want to add formal identities just to turn them into monoids.


Another variant with strong links with category theory is that of [[inverse semigroups]], which [[Charles Ehresmann]] showed were closely related to [[ordered groupoid]]s. Inverse semigroups naturally occur when considering partial symmetries of an object.

_AnonymousCoward_: In _Categories of Symmetries and Infinite-Dimensional Groups_ by Yu. A. Neretin (London Mathematical Society Monographs, New Series 16, Oxford Science Publications 1996), the author points out that if we consider an infinite-dimensional group $G$ can be realized in the following way: there is some category $C$ with an object $X$ such that 
$$
Aut(X)=G.
$$
Then we have this special semigroup 
$$
\Gamma=End(X)
$$
which is called the **Mantle** of $G$. Neretin insists it is a semigroup.

I am at a loss as to why this is a semigroup, and not a monoid...

## Internalization 

We can [[internalization|internalize]] the concept of semigroup in any [[monoidal category]] (or even [[multicategory]]) $V$ to get a __semigroup object__ in $V$.
