An _orbifold_ is a [[topological stack]] which may be presented by a proper etale [[Lie groupoid]]. Morita equivalent Lie groupoids give rise to the same orbifold. One can consider a bicategory of proper etale Lie groupoids and the orbifolds will be the objects of certain bicategorical localization of this bicategory (a result of Moerdijk and Pronk). 

An orbifold is traditionally defined as a topological space equipped with an orbifold structure, which is in turn an equivalence class of orbifold atlases. An orbifold is locally a stack quotient of a smooth manifold by a finite group. Every orbifold is globally a quotient of a smooth manifold by an action of finite-dimensional Lie group with finite stabilizers in each point (the construction uses frame bundle). Word orbifold is invented by Thurston, while the original name was V-manifold (Satake), and was taken in a more restrictive sense, assuming that the action of finite groups in the charts is always effective. 

People say "orbifold" when they want to emphasise that they are quotients by group action.

Orbifolds often appear as moduli spaces in differential geometric setting:

It has been noticed that the topological invariants of the underlying topological space of an orbifold as a topological space with an orbifold structure are not appropriate, but have to be corrected leading to orbifold Euler characteristics, orbifold cohomology etc. One of the constructions which is useful in this respect is the inertia orbifold (inertia stack of the original orbifold) which gives rise to "twisted sectors" in Hilbert space of a quantum field theory on the orbifold, and also to twisted sectors in the appropriate cohomology spaces. Further generalization are multitwisted sectors. 

An interesting generalization of an orbifold is so-called weighted branched manifold, see

There is also a notion of finite stabilizers in algebraic geometry. A singular variety is called an (algebraic) orbifold if it has only so-called orbifold singularities.
