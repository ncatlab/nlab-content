## Idea

An [[orbifold]] is much like a [[smooth manifold]] but possibly with [[singularities]] of the form of [[fixed points]] of [[group]]-[[actions]].

Where a [[smooth manifold]] is a [[space]] locally modeled on [[Cartesian spaces]]/[[Euclidean spaces]] $\mathbb{R}^n$, an _orbifold_ is, more generally, a [[space]] that is locally modeled on [[Lie groupoid|smooth]] [[action groupoids]] ([[homotopy quotients]]) $\mathbb{R}^n\sslash G$ of a [[finite group]] $G$ [[action|acting]] on a [[Cartesian space]].

This turns out to be broadly captured([Moerdijk-Pronk 97](#MoerdijkPronk97), [Moerdijk 02](#Moerdijk02)) by saying that an orbifold is a [[proper groupoid|proper]] [[étale groupoid|étale]] [[Lie groupoid]]. ([[Morita equivalence|Morita equivalent]] Lie groupoids correspond to the same orbifolds.)

The word _orbifold_ was introduced in ([Thurston 1992](#Thurston)), while the original name was _$V$-manifold_ ([Satake](#Satake)), and was taken in a more restrictive sense, assuming that the [[actions]] of [[finite groups]] on the charts are always [[effective group action|effective]]. Nowadays these are called _effective orbifolds_ and those which are global quotients by a finite group are _global quotient orbifolds_.  

There is also a notion of finite stabilizers in [[algebraic geometry]]. A singular variety is called an (algebraic) _orbifold_ if it has only so-called _orbifold singularities_.

## Definition

An orbifold is a stack presented by an [[orbifold groupoid]].

## Properties

### General

* One can consider a [[bicategory]] of proper &#233;tale Lie groupoids and the orbifolds will be the objects of certain bicategorical [[localization]] of this bicategory (a result of [Moerdijk-Pronk 97](#MoerdijkPronk97)). 


* Equivalently, every orbifold is globally a quotient of a smooth manifold by an [[action]] of finite-dimensional [[Lie group]] with finite [[stabilizer subgroup|stabilizers]] in each point. (eg ([Adem-Leida-Ruan 2007](#ALR07)), Corollary 1.24)


### Global quotient orbifolds
 {#GlobalQuotientOrbifolds}

In ([ALR 07, theorem 1.23](#ALR07)) is asserted that every effective orbifold $X$ (paracompact, Hausdorff) is isomorphic to a global quotient orbifold, specifically to a global quotient of $O(n)$ (where $n$ is the dimension of $X$) acting on the [[frame bundle]] of $X$ (which is a manifold).

### (Co)homology

It has been noticed that the topological invariants of the underlying topological space of an orbifold as a topological space with an orbifold structure are not appropriate, but have to be corrected leading to [[orbifold Euler characteristics]], [[orbifold cohomology]] etc. One of the constructions which is useful in this respect is the [[inertia orbifold]] (the inertia stack of the original orbifold) which gives rise to "twisted sectors" in Hilbert space of a quantum field theory on the orbifold, and also to twisted sectors in the appropriate cohomology spaces. A further generalization gives multitwisted sectors. 




## Examples

* Some basic building blocks of orbifolds:

  The quotient of a  [[ball]] by a [[discrete group|discrete]] [[subgroup]] of the [[special orthogonal group]] of rotations. Is an orbifold, and orbifolds may be obtained by cutting out balls from ordinary [[smooth manifolds]] and gluing in these orbifold quotients.

* The [[moduli stack of elliptic curves]] over the [[complex numbers]] is an orbifold, being the [[homotopy quotient]] of the [[upper half plane]] by the [[special linear group]] acting by [[Möbius transformations]].

* For $\mathcal{G}$ any orbifold, then the [[mapping space]] $\mathcal{G}^{\Pi(S^1)} = \mathcal{G}^{B\mathbb{Z}}$ is again an orbifold, called the [[inertia orbifold]].

* [[G2-orbifolds]]

* [[lens spaces]]

* [[ADE singularities]]

* [[metric cones]]

* [[orbifold Euler characteristic]]

Orbifolds are in [[differential geometry]] what [[Deligne-Mumford stacks]] are in [[algebraic geometry]]. See also at _[[geometric invariant theory]]_ and _[[GIT-stable point]]_.

If the finiteness condition is dropped one also speaks of _[[orbispaces]] and generally of [[stacks]].

Orbifolds may be regarded as a kind of _[[stratified spaces]]_.
