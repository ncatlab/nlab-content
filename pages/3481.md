# The axiom of multiple choice

## Idea

The **axiom of multiple choice** (AMC) is a weak version of the [[axiom of choice]] which can hold in [[constructive mathematics]].


## Statement

A set-indexed family $\{D_c\}_{c\in C}$ of sets is said to be a *collection family* if for any $c\in C$ and any [[surjection]] $E\twoheadrightarrow D_c$, there exists a $c'\in C$ and a surjection $D_{c'}\twoheadrightarrow D_c$ which factors through $E$.

The *axiom of multiple choice* states one of two things:

1. for every set $X$, there exists a collection family $\{D_c\}_{c\in C}$ such that $X\cong D_c$ for some $c$, or
1. for every set $X$, there exists a collection family $\{D_c\}_{c\in C}$ and a family of surjections $\{D_c \to X\}_{c\in C}$.

The second formulation seems to be the one originally given by M&P, below, while the first is that given by [[Michael Rathjen]] and attributed to [[Peter Aczel]] and Simpson.

[[Mike Shulman]]: Are these the same?  If not, why are they given the same name?

## Relationships to other axioms

* Note that $P$ is a [[projective set]] if and only if the singleton family $\{P\}$ is a collection family.  Therefore, since AC is equivalent to "all sets are projective," it implies AMC.

* An extension of this argument shows that [[COSHEP]] is sufficient to imply AMC.

* The [[Reflection Principle]] (RP) is equivalent to AMC (called strong AMC by van den Berg). RP is motivated by the regular extension principle (REA) from constructive set theory. RP states that every map belongs to a representable class of small maps.

* However, AMC does not imply [[countable choice]] or any of the other usual consequences of AC.

* Rathjen proves that [[SVC]] also implies AMC.  It follows that AMC holds in "most" models of set theory.

* AMC implies [[WISC]], and therefore also implies that the category of [[anafunctors]] between two [[small categories]] is [[essentially small category|essentially small]]. Thus WISC may be termed "weak axiom of multiple choice".

* A [[Î W-pretopos]] satisfying the (weak) axiom of multiple choice is a _[[predicative topos]]_, or removing the word "weak", we may speak of a strong predicative topos.
