## Idea

The _Milnor-Quillen theorem on $MU$_ determines the structure of the [[graded ring]] $\pi_{\bullet}(MU)$ of [[stable homotopy groups]] of the universal complex [[Thom spectrum]] [[MU]].

In ([Milnor 60](#Milnor60)) it was shown this is the [[polynomial ring]] $\mathbb{Z}[y_1, y_2, \cdots]$ on generators $y_{n+1}$ in degree $2(n+1)$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. 

Notice that by [[Thom's theorem]], this is also isomorphic to the [[cobordism ring]] $\Omega_\bullet^U \simeq \pi_\bullet(M U)$ of [[smooth manifolds]] equipped with stable [[almost complex structure]].

Moreover, by [[Lazard's theorem]], this graded ring is also abstractly [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[Lazard ring]] $L$.

But the [[universal complex orientation on MU]] induces a preferred ring [[homomorphism]]

$$
  L \longrightarrow \pi_\bullet(M U) \simeq \Omega_\bullet^U \simeq \mathbb{Z}[y_1, y_2, \cdots]
  \,.
$$

A priori it is not clear whether this particular canonical homomorphism exhibits the [[isomorphism]]. But it does, this is the result of ([Quillen 69](#Quillen69)).

## Statement

Write $MU$ for the [[E-∞ ring]] [[spectrum]] of [[complex cobordism cohomology theory]]. Since this is a [[complex oriented cohomology theory]], by [[Lazard's theorem]] there is associated a commutative 1-dimensional [[formal group law]] classified by a [[ring]] homomorphism of the form

$$
  L \longrightarrow \pi_\bullet(MU)
$$

from the [[Lazard ring]] $L$.

###### Theorem

This canonical homomorphism is an [[isomorphism]] 

$$
  L \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} \pi_\bullet(MU)
  \,.
$$

=--

This is due to ([Quillen 69](#Quillen69)), based on ([Milnor 60](#Milnor60)), reproduced e.g. as ([Kochmann 96, theorem 3.7.7, theorem 4.4.13](#Kochmann96)).

**Proof strategy:** (for Milnor's part) 

Apply the [[Boardman homomorphism]] to get the statement over the [[rational numbers]]. Deduce that $\pi_\bullet(MU)$ is finitely generated so that it is now sufficient to prove it over the [[p-adic integers]] for all $p$. 

Now use the $H\mathbb{F}_p$-[[Adams spectral sequence]], which, on its second page, expresses these homotopy groups by the $H\mathbb{F}_p$-[[homology of MU]].

The [[homology of MU]] may be computed by reducing, via the [[Thom isomorphism]], to computation of the homology of the [[classifying space]] $B U$, which in turn is given by [[Kronecker pairing]] from the [[Conner-Floyd Chern classes]]. 

Using this and applying the [[change of rings theorem]], the [[Adams spectral sequence]] is seen to collapse right away, and so the result may now be obtained by explicitly computing the relevant comodule [[Ext]]-groups of the [[homology of MU]]

###### Remark

The dual generalized [[Steenrod algebra]] $MU_\bullet(MU)$ has a structure of 
[[Hopf algebroid over a commutative base]] which is the 
[[Lazard ring]].
This is the content of the [[Landweber-Novikov theorem]].
