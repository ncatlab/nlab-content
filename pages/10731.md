## Statement

Write $MU$ for the [[E-∞ ring]] [[spectrum]] of [[complex cobordism cohomology theory]]. Since this is a [[complex oriented cohomology theory]], by [[Lazard's theorem]] there is associated a [[formal group law]] classified by a [[ring]] homomorphism of the form

$$
  L \longrightarrow \pi_\bullet(MU)
$$

from the [[Lazard ring]] $L$.

###### Theorem

This canonical homomorphism is an [[isomorphism]] 

$$
  L \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} \pi_\bullet(MU)
  \,.
$$

This is due to [Quillen 69](#Quillen69)

###### Remark

Moreover, there is a [[Hopf algebroid]] structure over the [[Lazard ring]]
on the dual generalized [[Steenrod algebra]] $MU_\bullet(MU)$.
This is the content of the [[Landweber-Novikov theorem]].
