## Idea

The operation called _Connes fusion_ (after [[Alain Connes]]) is a tensor product operation of [[Hilbert space]] [[bimodule]]s over [[von Neumann algebra]]s that adjusts the naive algebraic tensor product.

## Applications

Connes fusion is used to define fusion of positive energy representations of the [[loop group]] $\mathcal{L}S U(N)$ in

* Antony Wassermann, _Operator algebras and conformal field theory III_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.OA/9806031)) .

It is used in a proposal for a construction of [[string group]]-[[principal bundle]]s in the context of finding geometric models for [[elliptic cohomology]] in 

* [[Stephan Stolz]] and [[Peter Teichner]], _What is an elliptic object?_ ([link](http://math.berkeley.edu/~teichner/Papers/Oxford.pdf))



## References

The fusion operation on [[Hilbert space|Hilbert]] [[module]]s of [[von Neumann algebra]]s has been described in

and in 1983 studied further by V. Jones in context of subfactors.

R. M Brower and N. P. Landsman described a [[bicategory]] of von Neumann algebras, Connes' correspondences as morphisms and (bounded) intertwiners as 2-cells. They proved that the equivalence in that bicategory is the same as usual [[Morita equivalence]] of von Neumann algebras as studied by [[Mark Rieffel]] and others.
