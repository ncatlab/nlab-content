The fusion operation on Hilbert modules of [[von Neumann algebra]]s has been described in

* A. Connes, On the spatial theory of von Neumann algebras, J. of functional analysis 35 (1980) 153--164;

and in 1983 studied further by V. Jones in context of subfactors. 

A useful review of Connes fusion observing some simplifications is

* Andreas Thom, _A remark about the Connes fusion tensor product_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.OA/0601045))

An attempt to summarize that in a blog entry is [here](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/string/archives/000718.html)

R. M Brower and N. P. Landsman described a [[bicategory]] of von Neumann algebras, Connes' correspondences as morphisms and (bounded) intertwiners as 2-cells. They proved that the equivalence in that bicategory is the same as usual [[Morita equivalence]] of von Neumann algebras as studied by [[Mark Rieffel]] and others. 

#Applications#

Connes fusion is used to define fusion of positive energy representations of the [[loop group]] $\mathcal{L}S U(N)$ in

* Antony Wassermann, _Operator algebras and conformal field theory III_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.OA/9806031)) .

It is used to define [[elliptic cohomology]] in 

* Stephan Stolz and Peter Teichner, _What is an elliptic object?_ ([link](http://math.berkeley.edu/~teichner/Papers/Oxford.pdf))
