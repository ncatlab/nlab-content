## Idea

A _locally cartesian closed model category_ is a [[locally cartesian closed category]] which is equipped with the structure of a [[model category]] in a compatible way.

## Definition

A [[model category]] $\mathcal{C}$ which is additionally a [[locally cartesian closed category]] is called a **locally cartesian closed model category** if for any [[fibration]] $g\colon A\to B$ between [[fibrant objects]], the [[dependent product]] [[adjunction]]
$$ g^* : \mathcal{C}/B \rightleftarrows \mathcal{C}/A : \Pi_g $$
is a [[Quillen adjunction]].

Concretely, this means that both [[cofibrations]] and [[trivial cofibrations]] are [[pullback-stability|stable]] under [[pullback]] along fibrations between fibrant objects.

## Examples

Any [[right proper model category]] which is locally cartesian closed and in which the cofibrations are the [[monomorphisms]] is a locally cartesian closed model category.  This includes the classical [[model structure on simplicial sets]], as well as the [[injective model structure|injective]] [[global model structure on simplicial presheaves]].

## Applications

* Modulo questions of strictness and coherence (see [[identity type]] for details), locally cartesian closed model categories provide [[categorical semantics]] for [[homotopy type theory]] with [[function extensionality]].

## Related concepts

* [[cartesian closed model category]]
