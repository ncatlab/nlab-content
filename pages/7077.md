## Idea

A _locally cartesian closed model category_ is a [[locally cartesian closed category]] which is equipped with the structure of a [[model category]] in a compatible way.

## Applications

* Locally cartesian closed model categories provide [[categorical semantics]] for [[homotopy type theory]] with the [[univalence axiom]].

## Related concepts

* [[cartesian closed model category]]
