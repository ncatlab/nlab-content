## Idea

A _locally cartesian closed model category_ is a [[locally cartesian closed category]] which is equipped with the structure of a [[model category]] in a compatible way.

## Definition

A [[model category]] $\mathcal{C}$ which is additionally a [[locally cartesian closed category]] is called a **locally cartesian closed model category** if for any [[fibration]] $g\colon A\to B$ between [[fibrant objects]], the [[dependent product]] [[adjunction]]
$$ 
  g^* : \mathcal{C}/B \rightleftarrows \mathcal{C}/A : \Pi_g 
$$
is a [[Quillen adjunction]] between the corresponding [[slice model structures]].

Concretely, this means that both [[cofibrations]] and [[trivial cofibrations]] are [[pullback-stability|stable]] under [[pullback]] along fibrations between fibrant objects.

Equivalently this means that for all $A \to B$ as above the [[internal hom]] [[adjunction]] in the [[slice category]] over $B$

$$
  (-) \times_{\mathcal{C}/_B} A 
  \;:\;
  \mathcal{C}/_B
  \rightleftarrows
  \mathcal{C}/_B
  \;:\;
  [A, -]_{\mathcal{C}/_B}
$$

is a [[Quillen adjunction]].


## Examples

Any [[right proper model category]] which is locally cartesian closed and in which the cofibrations are the [[monomorphisms]] is a locally cartesian closed model category.  This includes the classical [[model structure on simplicial sets]], as well as the [[injective model structure|injective]] [[global model structure on simplicial presheaves]].  More generally, it includes any right proper [[Cisinski model structure]].

## Versus locally cartesian closed $(\infty,1)$-categories

It is easy to see that the $(\infty,1)$-category presented by a locally cartesian closed model category is itself [[locally cartesian closed (infinity,1)-category|locally cartesian closed]].  Conversely, any [[locally presentable (infinity,1)-category|locally presentable]] locally cartesian closed $(\infty,1)$-category can be presented by some right proper Cisinski model category, which is therefore a locally cartesian closed model category; see [[locally cartesian closed (infinity,1)-category]] for the proof.

## Applications

* Modulo questions of strictness and [[coherence]] (see [[identity type]] for details), locally cartesian closed model categories provide [[categorical semantics]] for [[homotopy type theory]] with [[function extensionality]].
