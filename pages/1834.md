__Nikolai Durov__  (Николай Валерьевич Дуров) is a Russian mathematician from St. Petersburg with main current interests in [[arithmetic geometry]], currently employed at St. Petersburg  Department of the Steklov Institute of Mathematics.

Durov obtained his Ph.D. in 2007 in Bonn under [Gerd Faltings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerd_Faltings):

Durov's mathematical work preceding his study in Bonn includes his work on classical [[Galois theory]] of polynomial equations; it provides essentially the third historically available method to compute algorithmically a Galois group of a given equation. His method is however statistical and some random data are included in input. The algorithm terminates with probability $1$ for all equations iff the [[Riemann hypothesis]] is true. The exposition of these results is in

Nikolai Durov is also an experienced computer programmer. He was a member of a St Petersburg State University student team winning a student [world tournament](http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~agupta/_projects/acm_ibm/acm2001.htm) in programming. His high school education was in Italy. His younger brother [Pavel V. Durov](http://durov.vkontakte.ru) is a professional programmer and main constructor behind [one of the most popular internet sites](http://Vkontakte.ru) in Russia. 

Nikolai Durov is currently working on his habilitation thesis. His earlier publications also include 

* N. Durov, S. Meljanac, A. Samsarov, [[Z. Škoda]], _A universal formula for representing Lie algebra generators as formal power series with coefficients in the Weyl algebra_, Journal of Algebra 309, n. 1, 318--359 (2007)
([doi:jalgebra](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jalgebra.2006.08.025))
([math.RT/0604096](http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/math.RT/0604096)).

where in chapters 7--9 Durov presented a flexible theory of a class of functors which can be viewed as representing generalizations of [formal schemes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_scheme) but over an arbitrary ring, and with weaker assumptions. This theory is then applied to a problem in Lie theory and deformation theory; an interesting chapter on symplectic Weyl algebras is included. In chapter 10 an alternative method using [[Hopf algebras]] rather than geometry is presented.  

Recently he introduced the notion of a [[vectoid]] and the related notion of an [[algebrad]] which is a generalization of the notions of a symmetric and a non-symmetric operad:
