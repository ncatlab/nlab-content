## Idea

Exotic branes are non-perturbative [[branes]] in [[non-perturbative string theory]], describing [[non-geometric backgrounds]].

According to [deBoer & Shigemori 2012, p. 12](#deBoerShigemori12) these may be identified as [[codimension]]-2 [[defect branes]] with [[U-duality]]-[[group]] [[monodromy]].

>Figure 1 from ([BMO19](#BMO19)). <<A comparison of the objects covered by the geometric solutions (backed by orange hashing) and [[non-geometric solutions]] (backed by green hashing) out of all the [[branes]] down to codimension-$2$ and[^1] $0\leq\alpha\leq -2$, as well as their [[M-theory]] lifts. Red lines denote [[T-duality]], blue lines denote lifts/[[double dimensional reduction|reductions]] and black lines denote [[S-dualities]].>>

[^1]: Here $\alpha$ denotes the [[exponent]] with which the brane's [[tension]] $T$ scales with the [[string coupling constant]] $g_s$ as $T \propto (g_s)^\alpha$, according to [BMO 2019](#BMO19), [p. 2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.10247.pdf#page=2).
