>Figure grabbed from ([BMO19](#BMO19)). <<A comparison of the objects covered by the geometric solutions (backed by orange hashing) and non-geometric solutions (backed by green hashing) out of all the [[branes]] down to codimension-$2$ and $0\leq\alpha\leq -2$, as well as their [[M-theory]] lifts. Red lines denote [[T-duality]], blue lines denote lifts/reductions and black lines denote [[S-dualities]].>>
