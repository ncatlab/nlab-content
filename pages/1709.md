## Idea 
 {#Idea}


By the discussion at _[[cohomology]]_, plain cohomology is the study of 

* [[(∞,1)-categorical hom-spaces]] in [[(∞,1)-toposes]] (for "[[nonabelian cohomology]]") 

* or their [[stabilizations]]  to [[stable (∞,1)-categories]] of [[spectrum objects]] (for "[[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]]") 

* or generally in  [[symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-categories]] 

and maybe fully generally in any [[(∞,1)-category]] $\mathcal{C}$ whatsoever.

So for $A \in \mathcal{C}$ any [[object]] the [[cohomology]] of any other object $X$ with [[coefficients]] in $A$ is the [[mapping space]] $\mathcal{C}(X,A)$. Notice that this is equivalently the [[homotopy type]] of [[sections]] $\mathcal{C}_{/X}(X, X \times A)$ of the trivial $A$-[[fiber ∞-bundle]] over $X$. The idea of _twisted cohomology_ then is to consider general $A$-[[fiber ∞-bundles]] $\chi$ over $X$ and take the $\chi$-twisted cohomology of $X$ to the the type of [[sections]] of this.

Given an $\infty$-topos $\mathbf{H}$, then also its arrow $\infty$-category $\mathbf{H}^I$ is an $\infty$-topos, over $\infty Grpd^I$ and it also sits over $\mathbf{H}$ by the [[codomain fibration]], constituting an "[[extension]]" of $\mathbf{H}$ by itself:

$$
  \array{
    \mathbf{H}
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{incl}}
    \\
    \mathbf{H}^I
    \\
   \downarrow^{\mathrlap{cod}}
     \\
    \mathbf{H}
  }
  \,.
$$

The intrinsic cohomology of $\mathbf{H}^I$ under this fibration is [[nonabelian cohomology|nonabelian]] twisted cohomology as discussed in some detail in _[[schreiber:Principal ∞-bundles -- theory, presentations and applications]]_.

Notice that "stable cohomology", which is traditionally called [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] may be thought of as the lowest order [[Goodwillie calculus|Goodwillie]] approximation to [[nonabelian cohomology]]: where a cocycle in nonabelian cohomology is a map to any [[homotopy type]], a cocycle in [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] is a map into a [[stable homotopy type]].

In this sense the [[tangent (infinity,1)-topos]] $T \mathbf{H}$ is the lowest order linear approximation to the [[codomain fibration]]

$$
  \array{
    \Stab(\mathbf{H})
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{incl}}
    \\
    T\mathbf{H}
    \\
   \downarrow^{\mathrlap{cod}}
     \\
    \mathbf{H}
  }
  \,.
$$

Higher-order approximations should involve a notion of higher-order forms of the tangent (∞,1)-topos, in parallel with the relationship between the [[jet bundles]] and [[tangent bundle]] of a manifold. It is clear that whatever we may say in detail about the $k$th-[[jet (∞,1)-category|jet (∞,1)-topos]] $J^k \mathbf{H}$, its intrinsic cohomology is a version of twisted cohomology which is in between [[nonabelian cohomology]] and stable i.e. [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]].

It seems that a layered analysis of nonabelian cohomology this way in higher homotopy theory should eventually be rather important, even if it hasn't received any attention at all yet. It seems plausible that a generalization of [[Chern-Weil theory]] which approximates classes of [[principal infinity-bundles]] not just by [[universal characteristic classes]] in [[ordinary cohomology]] and hence in stable cohomology, but that one wants to consider the whole Goodwillie Taylor tower of approximations to it.

### In an $\infty$-topos -- twisted nonabelian (sheaf) cohomology
 {#InAnInfinityTopos}


Let $\mathcal{C} = \mathbf{H}$ be an [[(∞,1)-topos]]. Let $A \in \mathbf{H}$ be any [[object]], to be called the [[coefficient]] object.

Write $\mathbf{Aut}(A) \in Grp(\mathbf{H})$ for the [[automorphism ∞-group]] of $A$ and $\mathbf{B}\mathbf{Aut}(A) \in \mathbf{H}$ for its [[delooping]]. There is a canonical  [[∞-action]] of $\mathbf{Aut}(A)$ on $A$ exhibited by the corresponding universal [[associated ∞-bundle]]

$$
  \array{
    A &\to& A//\mathbf{Aut}(A)
    \\
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\rho_A}}
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}\mathbf{Aut}(A)
  }
  \,.
$$

Let $X \in \mathbf{H}$ be any object.
 
+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A **twist** for $A$-[[cohomology]] on $X$ is a morphism $\chi \colon X \to \mathbf{B}\mathbf{Aut}(A)$ in $\mathbf{H}$. The corresponding [[associated ∞-bundle|associated]] $A$-[[fiber ∞-bundle]] over $X$ which is the [[homotopy pullback]]

$$
  \array{
    \chi^\ast \rho_A &\to& A//\mathbf{Aut}(A)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\rho_A}} 
    \\
    X &\stackrel{\chi}{\to}& \mathbf{B}\mathbf{Aut}(A)
  }
$$

we call the [[local coefficient ∞-bundle]] for twisted $A$-cohomology classified by $\chi$. 

The *[[cocycle]] [[∞-groupoid]] of $\chi$-twisted $A$-cohomology* is 

$$
  \Gamma_X(\chi^\ast \rho_A) \in \infty Grpd
  \,.
$$

The **$\chi$-twisted cohomology set** of $X$ is 

$$
  \pi_0 \Gamma_X(\chi^\ast \rho_A) \in Set
$$

=--

Special cases of this definition are implicit in traditional literature. The above statement appears in this form in ([Nikolaus-Schreiber-Stevenson 12](#NikolausSchreiberStevenson12)).

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

The $\chi$-twisted cohomology is equivalently the ordinary cohomology of $\chi$ with [[coefficients]] in $\rho_A$ in the [[slice (∞,1)-topos]] of $\mathbf{H}$ over $\mathbf{B}\mathbf{Aut}(A)$:

$$
  \Gamma_X(\chi^\ast \rho_A)
  \simeq
  \mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}\mathbf{Aut}(A)}(\chi, \rho_A)
  \,.
$$

=--




### In a stabilized $\infty$-topos -- twisted ES-type (sheaf) cohomology
 {#InAStabilizedInfinityTopos}

Let now $\mathcal{C} = Stab(\mathbf{H})$ be an [[stable (∞,1)-category]] of [[spectrum objects]] in an ambient [[(∞,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$. Let $E \in CRing_\infty(\mathbf{H})$ be a corresponding [[E-∞ ring]] object. Write

$$
  GL_1(E) \hookrightarrow \mathbf{Aut}(E)
  \in 
  Grp(\mathbf{H})
$$

for the [[∞-group of units]] of $E$. 

Now a twist $\chi \;\colon\; X \to \mathbf{B}GL_1(E)$ classifies an [[(∞,1)-module bundle]] of $E$-lines. The $\chi$-twisted $E$-cohomology is again the (stable) homotopy type of sections of this.

For the case of [[twisted K-theory]] (see the references there) this description goes back to [[Jonathan Rosenberg]]. The above general abstract description is developed in ([Ando-Blumberg-Gepner 10](#ABG10)).

+-- {: .num_remark #PicardGeneralizingGL1}
###### Remark

There are canonical maps

$$
  \mathbf{B}GL_1(E) \simeq E Line \hookrightarrow Pic(E Mod)
  \hookrightarrow E Mod
  \,,
$$

where $Pic(E Mod)$ denotes the [[Picard ∞-groupoid]]. This suggest to speak not just of twists of the form $\chi \colon X \to \mathbf{B}GL_1(E) \simeq E Line \hookrightarrow E Mod$ but more generally of twists of the form $\chi \colon Pic(E Mod) \hookrightarrow E Mod$. While these in general no longer define $E$-[[fiber ∞-bundles]] (so that sections of them are strictly speaking in general no longer locally $E$-cohomology cocycles), this more general notion has the advantage that it makes sense also in [[symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-categories]] different from those of the form $Stab(\mathbf{H})$. 

This we turn to [below](#InASymmetricMonoidalInfinityCategory).

### In a general symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category
 {#InASymmetricMonoidalInfinityCategory}


+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

If in the above situation we write $[X, E Mod]$ for the [[symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category]] of $E$-[[(∞,1)-module bundles]] on $X$, then given an object $\chi \in [X,E Mod]$ its homotopy type of sections, hence the $\chi$-twisted cohomology of $X$ is equivalently

$$
  Hom_{[X, E Mod]}(\mathbb{I}_X, \chi)
  \in 
  \infty Grpd
  \,,
$$

where $\mathbb{I}_X$ is the [[tensor unit]] object, the trivial $E$-[[(∞,1)-module bundle]] over $X$.

=--

In view of this and remark \ref{PicardGeneralizingGL1} one considers the following.

Let $(\mathcal{C}, \otimes)$ be a [[symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category]]. 

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

An object $\chi \in Pic(\mathcal{C})$ of the [[Picard ∞-groupoid]] of $\mathcal{C}$ we call a _twist_ for [[cohomology]] in $\mathcal{C}$. For $X, A \in \mathcal{C}$ any two [[objects]], we say that the *$\chi-twisted$ cohomology of $X$ with [[coefficients]] in $A$* is

$$
  \mathcal{C}(X, \chi \otimes A) \in \infty Grpd
  \,.

## Properties





### Twisted cohomology with trivial twisting cocycle

> old material, to be harmonized...

Let  ${*} \to B$ be a [[pointed object]]. Then

* we say that the [[cocycle]] 

  $(X \to * \to B) \in \mathbf{H}(X,B)$ 

  is the **trivial $B$-cocycle** on $X$.

*  the morphism $f:\hat{B}\to B$ induces a [[fibration sequence]] 

   $A \to \hat B \stackrel{f}{\to} B$ 

   in $\mathbf{H}$.


+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The $([*],f)$-twisted cohomology with trivial twisting cocycle is equivalent to the ordinary [[cohomology]] with coefficients in the [[homotopy fiber]] $A$ of $f$:

$$
  \mathbf{H}_{[*]}(X,f) \simeq \mathbf{H}(X,A)
  \,.
$$


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By definition, the [[homotopy fiber]] of $A$ is the [[homotopy pullback]]

$$ 
  \array{
    A &\to& *
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \hat B &\stackrel{f}{\to}& B
  }
$$

in $\mathbf{H}$. Since the $\infty$-groupoid valued [[derived hom-space|hom]] in an [[(∞,1)-category]] is [[exact functor|exact]] with respect ot [[homotopy limits]] (by definition of homotopy limits), it follows that for every object $X$, there is  fibration sequence of [[cocycle]] [[∞-groupoids]]

$$
  \array{
    \mathbf{H}(X,A) &\to& {*}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{const_{*}}}
    \\
    \mathbf{H}(X,\hat B) &\to& \mathbf{H}(X,B)
  }
  \,.
$$

By definition of twisted cohomology, this identifies

$$
  \mathbf{H}(X,A) \simeq \mathbf{H}_{[*]}(X,f)
  \,.
$$

=--

For this reason, when $B$ is pointed,
it is customary to call the set of equivalence classes $\pi_0\mathbf{H}_{[c]}(X;f)$ the **$c$-twisted $A$-cohomology of $X$**, and to denote it by the symbol

$$
  H_{[c]}(X,A)
$$

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark
The cohomology fibration sequence $\mathbf{H}(X,A) \to \mathbf{H}(X,\hat B) {\to} \mathbf{H}(X,B)$ can be seen as an **obstruction problem** in cohomology:

* the **obstruction** to lifting a $\hat B$-cocycle to an $A$-cocycle is its image in $B$-cohomology (all with respect to the given [[fibration sequence]])

But it also says:

* $A$-cocycles are, up to equivalence, precisely those $\hat B$-cocycles whose class in $B$-cohomology is the class of the trivial $B$-cocycle.

## Examples 

### Sections as twisted functions... {#SectionsAsTiwstedFunctions}

For $V$ a [[vector space]] and $X$ a manifold, both regarded a 0-[[truncated]] objects in the $(\infty,1)$-topos on the site [[CartSp]] (that of [[Lie infinity-groupoid]]s), a [[cocycle]] $X \to V$ is simply smooth $V$-valued function on $X$.

Now let $G$ be a Lie group with smooth [[delooping]] groupoid $\mathbf{B}G$ and let $\rho : \mathbf{B}G \to Vect$ be a [[representation]] of $G$ on $V$, i.e. $\rho(\bullet) = V$. Then the corresponding [[action groupoid]] $V//G$ sits in the [[fibration sequence]]

$$
  V \to V//G \stackrel{p}{\to} \mathbf{B}G
  \,.
$$

Hence we can ask for the $p$-twisted cohomology of $X$ with values in $V$. Now, a cocycle $g : X \to \mathbf{B}G$ is one classifying a $G$-[[principal bundle]] on $X$. By looking at this in [[Cech cohomology]] it is immediate to convince onself that cocycles $X \to V//G$ such that the composite $X \to V//G \stackrel{p}{\to} \mathbf{B}G$ is equivalent to the given $g$ are precisely the [[section]]s of the $\rho$-[[associated bundle|associated vector bundle]]:

on a patch $U_i$ of a good cover over wich $P$ has been trivialized, the cocycle $X \to V//G$ is simply a $V$-valued function $\sigma_i : U_i \to V$. Then on double overlaps it is a smooth [[natural transformation]] $\sigma_i|_{U_{i j}} \to \sigma_j|_{U_i j}$ whose components in $G$ are required to be those of the given cocycle $g$. That means exactly that the functions $(\sigma_i)$ are glued on double overlaps precisely as the local trivializations of a global section $\sigma : X \to P \times_G V$ would.

Hence we find the $p$-twisted cohomology is

$$
  H_{[g]}(X,V) = 
  \{sections\; of\; P \times_G V\}
  \,.
$$

In this sense **a section is a twisted function**.

Notice that $V//G \stackrel{p}{\to} \mathbf{B}G$ is not itself a homotopy fiber, but is a _lax_ fiber, in that we have a [[2-limit|lax pullback]] (really a _comma object_ )

$$
  \array{
    V//G &\to& *
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbf{B}G &\to& Vect
  }
  \,,
$$

where in the bottom right corner we have [[Vect]] (regarded as a [[stack]] on $CartSp$ in the evident way) and where the right vertical morphism sends the point to the ground field vector space $k$ (or rather sends $U \in CartSp$ to the trivial vector bundle $U \times k$ ).

We may paste to this the homotopy pullback along the cocycle $g : X \to \mathbf{B}G$ to obtain

$$
  \array{
    P\times_G V &\to& V//G &\to& *
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    X &\stackrel{g}{\to}& \mathbf{B}G &\to& Vect
  }
  \,.
$$

This makes is manifest that a section $\sigma : X \to P \times_G V$ is also the same as a natural transformation from $const_k : X \to Vect$ to $X \stackrel{g}{\to} \mathbf{B}G \to Vect$.

Notice moreover that in the special case that $G = U(1)$ and for ground field $k = \mathbb{C}$ we may think of $\mathbf{B}U(1)$ as the category $\mathbb{C} Line \hookrightarrow \mathbb{C} Mod = Vect$ and think of the twisting cocycle $g$ as

$$
  X \stackrel{g}{\to} \mathbb{C}Line \hookrightarrow \mathbb{C}Mod
  \,.
$$

#### ... and $\infty$-sections as twisted $\infty$-functions  
 {#InfSections}

Regarded this way, the above discussion has a generalization to the case where the [[monoid]] $\mathbb{C}$ is replaced with any [[ring spectrum]] $R$ and we consider

$$
  X \stackrel{\tau}{\to} R Line \hookrightarrow R Mod
  \,.
$$

Twisted cohomology in terms of such morphisms $\tau$ is effectively considered in

* [[Matthew Ando]], [[Andrew Blumberg]], [[David Gepner]], _Twists of K-theory and TMF_ ([arXiv:1002.3004](http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.3004))

and in unpublished work of [[Ulrich Bunke]] et al. For more on this see the discussion at [[(∞,1)-vector bundle]].

More generally one can hence twist with maps

$$
  X \to Pic(R) \hookrightarrow R Mod
$$

into the [[Picard ∞-group]] of $R Mod$.

### twisted K-theory 

In the context of [[generalized (Eilenberg–Steenrod) cohomology]] a coefficient object for [[cohomology]] is a [[spectrum]] $A$: the $A$-cohomology of a [[topological space]] $X$ with coefficients in $A$ is the set of homotopy classes of maps $X \to A$. For instance, as a model of the degree-$0$ space in the [[K-theory spectrum]] one can take $A = Fred(H)$, the space of Fredholm operators on a separable Hilbert space $H$. There is a canonical action on this space of the projective unitary group $G = P U(H)$ of $H$. Since $P U(H)$ has the homotopy type of an [[Eilenberg–Mac Lane space]] $K(\mathbb{Z},2)$, a $P U(H)$-[[principal bundle]] $P \to X$ defines a class $c \in H^3(X,\mathbb{Z})$ in [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum|ordinary integral cohomology]] (this may also be thought of as the class of a twisting [[bundle gerbe]]). The twisted K-theory (in degree $0$) of $X$ with that class as its twist is the set of homotopy classes of sections $X \to P \times_{P U(H)} Fred(H)$ of the associated bundle. 


### $G$-Actions on spectra  

The above example generalizes straightforwardly to the case that 

* $A$ is a [[spectrum|connective spectrum]], i.e. [[topological space]] that is an infinite [[loop space]]. (We need to assume a connective spectrum given by an infinite loop space so that $A$ can be regarded as living in the category of topologicall spaces along with the other objects, such as classifying spaces $\mathbf{B}G$ of nonabelian groups);

* with a (topological) [[group]] $G$ acting on $A$ by automorphisms and 

* a $G$-[[principal bundle]] $P \to X.$ 

In this case there is an established definition of [[generalized (Eilenberg–Steenrod) cohomology]] with coefficients $A$ _twisted_ by a $G$-[[principal bundle]] as follows.

From the $G$-[[principal bundle]] $P \to X$ we obtain the associated $A$-bundle $P \times_G A \to X$. Then a twisted $A$-cocycle on $X$ is defined to be a [[section]] $X \to P \times_G A$ of this associated bundle. The collection of homotopy classes of these sections is the _twisted $A$-cohomology of $X$_ with the twist specified by the class of $P$.

This is the definition of twisted cohomology as it appears for instance essentially as definition 22.1.1 of the May–Sigursson reference below (when comparing with their definition take their $G$ to be the trivial group and identify their $\Gamma$ and $\Pi$ with our $G$).

It is clearly a particular case of the general definition of twisted cohomology given above:
 
* the $(\infty,1)$-topos $\mathbf{H}$ is the $(\infty,1)$-category of [[Top]] of topological spaces

* the object $B$ is the [[delooping]] $\mathbf{B}G$ of the [[group]] $G$.

* the object $\hat{B}$ is the homotopy quotient $A//G\simeq \mathbf{E}G\times_G A$.

* the twisting cocycle $c$ is the element in $\mathbf{Top}(X,\mathbf{B}G)$ defining the principal $G$-bundle $P\to X$.

Indeed, $B$ is pointed, we have a fibration sequence
$$
A \to A//G \to \mathbf{B}G
$$
and the homotopy pullback
$$
  \array{
    P_A &\to& {A//G}
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow{f}
     \\ 
     X  &\stackrel{c}{\to}& \mathbf{B}G
  }\,
$$
is the $A$-bundle $P\times_G A\to X$.

The obstruction problem described by this example reads as folllows:

*  the obstruction to lifting a ("nonabelian" or "twisted") $A//G$-cocycle $g : X \to A//G$ to an $A$-cocycle $\hat g : X \to A$ is its image $\delta g $ in first $G$-cohomology  $\delta g \in H^1(X,G) :=\pi_0 \mathbf{Top}(X, \mathbf{B} G)$.

Read the other way round it says:

* $A$-cocycles are precisely those $G$-twisted $A$-cocycles whose twist vanishes.


+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Since the associated bundle $P \times_G A$ is in general no longer itself a spectrum, twisted cohomology is not an example of [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology|generalized Eilenberg–Steenrod cohomology]]. 

To stay within the spectrum point of view, May–Sigurdsson suggested that twisted cohomology should instead be formalized in terms of _[[parameterized homotopy theory]]_, where one thinks of $P \times_G A$ as a [[parameterized spectrum|parameterized family of spectra]]. 

=--







### Group cohomology with coefficients in a module 

Some somewhat trivial examples of this appear in various context. For instance [[group cohomology]] on a group with coefficients in a nontrivial module can be regarded as an example of twisted cohomology. See there for more details.

Compare this to the example below of cohomology "with local coefficients". It is the same principle in both cases.



### Twisted bundles


To get a feeling for how the definition does, it is 
instructive to see how for the fibration sequence coming from an ordinary central extension $K \to \hat G \to G$ of ordinary groups as

$$
  \mathbf{B}\hat G \to \mathbf{B}G \stackrel{\omega}{\to}
  \mathbf{B}^2 K
$$

classified by a [[group cohomology|group 2-cocycle]] $\omega$, $c$-twisted $\hat G$-cohomology produces precisely the familiar notion of [[twisted bundles]], with the twist being the lifting [[gerbe]] that obstructs the lift of a $G$-bundle to a $\hat G$-bundle.

This is also the first example in the list
in the last section of

* [[schreiber:Background fields in twisted differential nonabelian cohomology|Background fields in twisted differential nonabelian cohomology]]

and contains examples that are of interest in the wider context of [[string theory]].

See also [Twisted Differential String- and Fivebrane-Structures](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/03/twisted_differential_string_an.html).




### Cohomology with local coefficients 

What is called **cohomology with local coefficients** is twisted cohomology with the twist given by the class represented by the universal cover space of the base space, which is to say: by the action of the fundamental group of the base space.

In the classical case of ordinary cohomology, C. A. Robinson in 1972 constructed a _twisted_ $K(\pi,n)$,
denoted $\tilde K(\pi,n)$, so that, for nice spaces,
the cohomology with local coefficients $\tilde H^n(X,\pi)$
with respect to a homomorphism $\varepsilon:\pi_1(X)\to Aut(\pi)$ is 
given by homotopy classes of maps $X\to \tilde K(\pi,n)$ compatible with $\varepsilon.$

More generally, for any space $X$, let $A$ be a coefficient object that is equipped with an action of the first [[fundamental group]] $\pi_1(X)$ of $X$. (Such an action is also called an $A$-valued [[local system]] on $X$).

Then there is the [[fibration sequence]]

$$
  A \to A//\pi_1(X) \to \mathbf{B} \pi_1(X)
$$ 

of this action. 

Notice that there is a canonical map $c : X \to \mathbf{B} \pi_1(X)$, the one that classifies the universal cover of $X$.

Then **$A$-cohomology with local coefficients** on $X$ is nothing but the $c$-twisted $A$-cohomology of $X$ in the above sense.

Details on Larmore's work on twisted cohomology are at

* [[Larmore twisted cohomology]].

The abstract discussion of twisted nonabelian cohomology in $\infty$-toposes is in 

* [[Thomas Nikolaus]], [[Urs Schreiber]], [[Danny Stevenson]],  _[[schreiber:Principal ∞-bundles -- theory, presentations and applications]]_
  {#NikolausSchreiberStevenson12}

The abstract discussion of twisted ES-type cohomology in the [[stable (infinity,1)-category of spectra]] is in

### Chronology of literature on twisted cohomology 


The oldest meaning of twisted cohomology is that of **cohomology with local coefficients** (see above).

For more on the history of that notion see

* [[History of cohomology with local coefficients]]

In the following we shall abbreviate

* tc = twisted cohomology

Searching MathSciNet for _twisted cohomology_ led to the following chronology: It missed older references in which the phrase was not used but the concept was in the sense of local coefficient systems – ancient and honorable.

Most notably missing are

* [[Kurt Reidemeister]] (1938) Topologie der Polyeder und kombinatorische 
Topologie der Komplexe_, Mathematik und ihre Anwendungen in 
Physik und Technik,_(But note that reprints appear, sans reviews. There is a short English and longer German review on Zentralblatt)

* [[Norman Steenrod]] (1942,1943)

* Olum (thesis 1947, published 1950)


Next come several that involve twisted differentials more generally.

Few are in terms of homotopy of spaces

tc ops should be treated as a single phrase – it may be that the ops are twisted, not the cohomology
