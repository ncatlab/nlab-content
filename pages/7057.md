## Definition

A _cartesian closed functor_ is a [[closed functor]] between [[cartesian closed categories]].

## Properties

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition
**(Frobenius reciprocity)**

Let $R : \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ be a [[functor]] between [[cartesian closed categories]] with a [[left adjoint]] $L$. Then $R$ is cartesian closed precisely if the [[natural transformation]]

$$
  (L \pi_1, \epsilon_A L \pi_2)
  : 
  L(B \times R(A))
  \to 
  L(B) \times A
$$

is an [[isomorphism]].

=--

This is called the **[[Frobenius reciprocity]]** law.

This is discussed for instance as ([Johnstone, lemma 1.5.8](#Johnstone)).

Let still $R$ and $L$ be as above.

###### Corollary

If $R$ is [[full and faithful]] and $L$ preserves binary [[products]], then $R$ is cartesian closed.

For instance ([Johnstone, corollary A1.5.9](#Johnstone)).
