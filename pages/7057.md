## Definition

A _cartesian closed functor_ is a functor between [[cartesian closed categories]] which preserves both [[products]] and [[exponential objects]] (all the structure of cartesian closed categories).

More precisely, if $F\colon C\to D$ preserves products, then the canonical maps $F(A\times B) \to F A \times F B$ are isomorphisms, and we therefore have canonical induced maps $F[A,B] \to [F A, F B]$ --- the [[adjuncts]] of the composite $F[A,B] \times F A \xrightarrow{\cong} F([A,B] \times A) \to F B$.  $F$ is **cartesian closed** if these maps $F[A,B] \to [F A, F B]$ are also isomorphisms.

When cartesian closed categories are identified with [[cartesian monoidal categories]] that are also [[closed monoidal category|closed monoidal]], a cartesian closed functor can be identified with a [[strong monoidal functor]] which is also [[strong closed functor|strong closed]].

###### Proposition
**(Frobenius reciprocity)**

Let $R : \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ be a [[functor]] between [[cartesian closed categories]] with a [[left adjoint]] $L$. Then $R$ is cartesian closed precisely if the [[natural transformation]]

$$
  (L \pi_1, \epsilon_A L \pi_2)
  : 
  L(B \times R(A))
  \to 
  L(B) \times A
$$

is an [[isomorphism]].

###### Proof
The above natural transformation is the [[mate]] of the exponential comparison natural transformation $R[A,B] \to [R A, R B]$ under the composite adjunctions
$$
\mathcal{C}
\underoverset{[R A, -]}{- \times R A}{\rightleftarrows}
\mathcal{C}
\underoverset{R}{L}{\rightleftarrows}
\mathcal{D}
$$
and
$$
\mathcal{C} 
\underoverset{R}{L}{\rightleftarrows}
\mathcal{D}
\underoverset{[A,-]}{A\times -}{\rightleftarrows}
\mathcal{D}
$$

This is called the **[[Frobenius reciprocity]]** law.  It is discussed, for instance, as ([Johnstone, lemma 1.5.8](#Johnstone)).

Let still $R$ and $L$ be as above.

###### Corollary

If $R$ is [[full and faithful]] and $L$ preserves binary [[products]], then $R$ is cartesian closed.
