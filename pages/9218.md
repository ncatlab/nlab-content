## Idea

For $E \to X$ a [[bundle]], (often taken to be a [[fiber bundle]] or at least typically taken to be a [[regular epimorphism|regular epimorphic]] map)  a _local section_ is a [[section]] of the [[pullback]] of the bundle along some $U \to X$, typically required to be an element of a [[covering family]] from some [[coverage]].

The assignment of local sections of some $E \to X$ to all admissible $U \to X$ is the ([[presheaf|pre]]-)[[sheaf]] of local sections assigned to a bundle.

In a [[finitely complete category|finitely complete]] [[site]] $(S,J)$ the assignment $X \mapsto \{p\colon Y \to X | p $ admits local sections over a $J$-cover $\}$ is a [[singleton pretopology]] on $S$.
