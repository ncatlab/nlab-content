## Idea

A _Killing vector_ on a ([[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo]]-)[[Riemannian manifold]] is a _covariantly constant vector_ : a [[vector field]] $v \in \Gamma(T C)$ that is annihilated by (the symmetrization of) the [[covariant derivative]] of the corresponding [[Levi-Civita connection]].

The [[exponential map|flow]]s of Killing vectors are [[isometries]] of the Riemannian manifold onto itself.

Similarly a _Killing spinor_ is a covariantly constant [[spinor]].
