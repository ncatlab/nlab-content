Let $k$ be a field, $H$ a $k$-bialgebra and $H^*$ a [[dual bialgebra]] with duality $\langle, \rangle : H\otimes H^*\to k$. The __left coregular action__ is a [[Hopf action]] of $H$ on $H^*$ given by

$$
(h,\phi) \mapsto R_h(\phi) := \phi_{(1)} \langle h, \phi_{(2)}\rangle 
$$

The corresponding representation $R_h: H\to End H^*$ is called the __left coregular representation__. It is used in the definition of [[Heisenberg double]].
