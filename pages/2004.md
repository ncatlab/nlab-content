Given a [[monad]] $\mathbf{T}=(T,\mu,\eta)$ in $Cat$, where $T:C\to C$ is an endofunctor with multiplication $\mu:TT\to T$ and unit $\eta:Id_C\to T$, a $\mathbf{T}$-module (or $\mathbf{T}$-algebra) in $C$ is a pair $(M,\nu)$ of an object $M\in C$ and a morphism $\nu:TM\to M$ which is a __$T$-action__, namely $\nu\circ T(\mu_M)=\nu\circ\mu_{TM} :TTM\to TM$ and $\nu\circ\eta_M = id_M$. 
A morphism of $\mathbf{T}$-modules $f:(M,\nu^M)\to (N,\nu^N)$ is a morphism $f:M\to N$ in $C$ such that it commutes with the action: $f\circ\nu^M=\nu^N\circ Tf:TM\to N$. The composition of morphisms of $\mathbf{T}$-modules is the composition of underlying morphisms in $C$.

$\mathbf{T}$-modules and their morphisms form a category $C^{\mathbf{T}}$ which is called the __Eilenberg-Moore category__ of the monad $\mathbf{T}$.

Eilenberg-Moore category satisfies a 2-categorical universal property, formulated in

* R. Street, _Formal theory of monads_, JPAA 1972 

In that article, monads a general (strict but only for simplicity) 2-category $K$ were considered, and the corresponding Eilenberg-Moore universal property defining __Eilenberg-Moore objects__ in $K$ were formulated. Not every 2-category admits Eilenberg-Moore objects. 

S. Lack has shown how the Eilenberg-Moore objects $C^{\mathbf{T}}$ can be obtained as combinations of certain simpler lax limits, when the 2-category $K$ in question is the 2-category of 2-algebras over a 2-monad $\mathbf{G}$ and lax, colax or pseudo morphisms of such:

This encompasses for example the theory of (op)monoidal monads and corresonding monoidal Eilenberg-Moore categories.
