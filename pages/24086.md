## Idea

A *counterexample* is an [[example]] for the [[negation]] of a statement.

A counterexample to a [[conjecture]] is a way to satisfy the hypotheses of the conjecture such that the conclusion is a contradiction.

## Examples

* [[counterexamples in algebra]]

* [[counterexamples in category theory]]

* [[Cauchy's mistake]]

* [[weak counterexample]]
