## Idea

*Asymptotic representation theory* is [[representation theory]] in the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] of large [[dimension]] of [[linear representation]] and/or of large [[groups]] being represented.

Much of asymptotic representation theory is concerned specifically with the [[symmetric group]] and studies asymptotics of shapes of [[Young diagrams]] and of numbers of [[Young tableaux]] under [[measures]] such as the [[Plancherel measure]] and/or the [[Schur-Weyl measure]].
