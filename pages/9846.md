## Idea

A [[pure motive]] defined by applying [[numerical equivalence]] of [[algebraic cycles]].

## Properties

### Semi-simple abelian category

The category of numerical motives is a [[semisimple category|semisimple]] [[abelian category]].

In fact, numerical equivalence is precisely the only [[adequate equivalence relation]] relation that gives the [[category of pure motives]] this property.
