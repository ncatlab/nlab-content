## Idea

It is common in informal language to speak of mathematical objects "equipped with extra structure" of some sort. The archetypical examples are [[algebras over a Lawvere theory]] in [[Set]]: these are [[sets]] equipped with the structure of certain algebraic operations. For instance a [[group]] $(G, e, \times)$ is a [[set]] $G$ equipped with a binary operation $\times : G \times G \to G$, etc.

One may formalize the notion of structure using the language of [[category theory]]. This is discussed at _[[stuff, structure, property]]_. In that formalization [[objects]] in some [[category]] $D$ are objects in some category $C$ _equipped with extra structure_ if there is a [[faithful functor]] $D \to C$. 


## Examples

There are gazillions of examples of objects equipped with extra structure. The most familiar is maybe

* [[algebraic structure]].

Generally the [[forgetful functor]] form a category of algebras over an [[algebraic theory]] down to the base category exhibits the equipment with the corresponding algebraic structure.

Or for instance in [[model theory]] given a [[first order language]] $L$ one can consider an [[structure in model theory|L-structure (in model theory)]] on a set.

Evident as the notion of _mathematical structure_ may seem these days, it was at least not made explicit until the middle of the 20th century. Then it was the influence of the _[[Bourbaki]]_-project (see there for more) and then later the development of [[category theory]] which made the notion explicit and finally led to the above formalization.
