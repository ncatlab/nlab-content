## Idea

There are different notions called __structure__ in [[mathematics]]:

* A concept of a _structure_ is formulated as the basic object of mathematics in the work of [[Bourbaki]], cf. [[structure after Bourbaki]].

* [[structure in model theory]] for a given language $L$ 

* [[algebraic structure]]

* In [[category theory]] we may talk about functor forgetting structure (formalizing an intuitive, related and in a way more general sense), see

  [[stuff, structure, property]]

  where adding [[extra structure]] and forgetting structure along a functor are formalized.
