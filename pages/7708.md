## Idea

It is common in informal language to speak of mathematical objects "equipped with extra structure" of some sort. The archetypical examples are [[algebras over a Lawvere theory]] in [[Set]]: these are [[sets]] equipped with the structure of certain algebraic operations. For instance a [[group]] $(G, e, {\cdot})$ is a [[set]] $G$ equipped with a binary operation ${\cdot} : G \times G \to G$, etc.

One may formalize the notion of structure using the language of [[category theory]]. This is discussed at _[[stuff, structure, property]]_. In that formalization [[objects]] in some [[category]] $D$ are objects in some category $C$ _equipped with extra structure_ if there is a [[faithful functor]] $D \to C$.

A special class of examples of this is the notion of structure in [[logic]] and [[model theory]]. In this case one defines a "language" or [[theory]] $L$ that describes the operations and properties with which we want to equip sets, and then sets equipped with those operations and properties are called $L$-[[structure in model theory|structures]] for that language or theory. 
(Equivalently one might say "sets with $L$-structure". Or one might generally say "$X$-structure" for "set with $X$-structure".) There is a [[faithful functor]] from $L$-structures to their underlying sets, and so this is a special case of the general definition.

(Note that the actual English word "structure" is used slightly differently in the two cases: in category theory, the "structure" is the operations and properties with which we want to equip sets, considered abstractly.  But in model theory, these data are called the "language" or the "theory", and a "structure" refers to a *particular* set (or family of sets) that is equipped with those operations and properties.  Thus the category theorist would refer to "the structure of a group" as consisting of a multiplication, a unit, etc., while the model theorist would say that each particular group (like $\mathbb{Z}$) is a "structure (or model) for the language (or theory) of groups.")


## Examples

There are gazillions of examples of objects equipped with extra structure. The most familiar is maybe

* [[algebraic structure]].

Generally the [[forgetful functor]] from a category of algebras over an [[algebraic theory]] down to the base category exhibits the equipment with the corresponding algebraic structure.

Evident as the notion of _mathematical structure_ may seem these days, it was at least not made explicit until the middle of the 20th century. Then it was the influence of the _[[Bourbaki]]_-project (see there for more) and then later the development of [[category theory]] which made the notion explicit and finally led to the above formalization.
