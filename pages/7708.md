The concept of a _structure_ is formulated as the basic object of mathematics in the work of [[Bourbaki]].

In [[model theory]], for a structure of a language $L$ is the same as [[model]] of $L$ with empty set of extra axioms. Given a first-order language $L$, which consists of symbols (variable symbols, constant symbols, function symbols and relation symbols including $\epsilon$) and quantifiers; a __structure__ for $L$, or $L$-structure is a set $M$ with an __interpretation__ for symbols: 

* if $R\in L$ is an $n$-ary relation symbol, then its interpretation $R^M\subset M^n$

* if $f\in L$ is an $n$-ary function symbol, then $f^M:M^n\to M$ is a function 

* if $c\in L$ is a constant symbol, then $c^M\in M$

Interpretation for an $L$-structure inductively defines an interpretation for well-formed formulas in $L$. We say that a sentence $\phi\in L$ is true in $M$ if $\phi^M$ is true. Given a [[theory]] $(L,T)$, which is a language $L$ 
together with a given set $T$ of sentences in $L$, the interpretation in a structure $M$ makes those sentences true or false; if all the sentences in $T$ are true in $M$ we say that $M$ is a [[model]] of $(L,T)$. 

As special case is of an __algebraic structure__, usually defined as a structure for a first order language with equality and $\epsilon$-relation, both with the standard interpretation, and no other relation symbols. Its function symbols are viewed as operations of various arity. They is a bit more general than an __algebraic theory__ in the monadic or operadic sense, as in those one needs to have free algebras, so (for example) fields do not form an algebraic theory, while they are the algebraic structures for the theory of fields. 

In [[category theory]] we may talk about functor forgetting structure (formalizing an intuitive, related and in a way more general sense), see
