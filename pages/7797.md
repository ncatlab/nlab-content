## Idea

For $X$ a [[space]] with a notion of _[[dimension]]_ $dim X \in \mathbb{N}$ and a notion of ([[Kähler differential form|Kähler]]) [[differential forms]] on it, the _canonical bundle_ over $X$ is the [[line bundle]] of $n$-forms on $X$, the $dim(X)$-fold [[exterior product]] 

$$
  L_{can} \coloneqq \Omega^n_X 
$$

of the bundle $\Omega^1_X$ of 1-forms.

The [[first Chern class]] of this bundle is also called the **canonical [[characteristic class]]** or just the **canonical class** of $X$.

Often this bundle is regarded via its [[sheaf]] of [[sections]].

A [[square root]] of the canonical class, hence another characteristic class $\Theta$ such that the [[cup product]] $2 \Theta = \Theta \cup \Theta$ equals the canonical class is called a _[[Theta characteristic]]_ (see also _[[metalinear structure]]_).

## Examples

Notice that if $X$ is for instance a [[complex manifold]] regarded over the complex numbers, then [[Kähler differential forms]] are _holomorphic_ forms.
