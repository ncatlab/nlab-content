Let $R$ be a commutative [[ring]]. By $E(R)$ denote the [[Boolean algebra]] of idempotents of $R$ whose meet operation is given by the multiplication of $R$. the __Pierce [[spectrum (geometry)|spectrum]]__ $\mathrm{Idl}(E(R))$ of $R$ is the [[partial order|poset]] (in fact [[locale]]) of ideals of $E(R)$.  There is a [[sheaf]] $\bar{R}$ of indecomposable rings (rings whose only idempotents are $0$ and $1$) on $\mathrm{Idl}(E(R))$, called the __Pierce sheaf__, whose ring of sections over the principal ideal $(e)$ (where $e$ is a prime [[filter]] in $E(R)$) is $R_e$.
