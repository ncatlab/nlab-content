## Idea

The _superparticle_ is a [[sigma-model]] [[quantum field theory]] analogous to the ordinary [[relativistic particle]] but where either the worldline or the target space are taken to be [[supermanifolds]]. Described by [[supersymmetric quantum mechanics]].

## Definitions

One way to define what this means classically is to give an [[action functional]] on spaces of maps from the worldline into super target space. One such is the

* [[Green-Schwarz action functional]].

The [[quantization]] of this action functional to a 1-dimensional worldvolume [[QFT]] is still largely an open problem.

An axiomatic description of the worldvolume QFT of the superparticle can be given in terms of [[FQFT]] as a representation of a category of super-[[cobordisms]]. One such approach is described at

* [[(1,1)-dimensional Euclidean field theories and K-theory]].

The algebraic data encoded by such a representation is essentially that of a 

* [[spectral triple]].

See there for more details.
