## Idea

The [[tensor product]] of [[modules]].

## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Let $R$ be a [[commutative ring]] and consider the multicategory $R$[[Mod]] of $R$-[[modules]] and $R$-[[multilinear maps]].  In this case the 
[[tensor product of modules]] $A\otimes_R B$ of $R$-[[modules]] $A$ and $B$ can be constructed as the [[quotient]] of the [[tensor product of abelian groups]] $A\otimes B$ underlying them by the [[action]] of $R$; that is,
$$ A\otimes_R B = A\otimes B / (a,r\cdot b) \sim (a\cdot r,b). $$

###### Definition

The tensor product $A \otimes_R B$
is the [[coequalizer]] of the two maps
$$ A\otimes R \otimes B \;\rightrightarrows\; A\otimes B $$
given by the action of $R$ on $A$ and on $B$.

###### Definition


If $R$ is a [[field]], then $R$-modules are [[vector spaces]]; this gives probably the most familiar case of a [[tensor product]] spaces, which is also probably the situation where the concept was first conceived.

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark


This tensor product can be generalized to the case when $R$ is not commutative, as long as $A$ is a right $R$-module and $B$ is a left $R$-module.  More generally yet, if $R$ is a [[monoid]] in any [[monoidal category]] (a ring being a monoid in [[Ab]] with its tensor product), we can define the tensor product of a left and a right $R$-module in an analogous way.  If $R$ is a commutative monoid in a [[symmetric monoidal category]], so that left and right $R$-modules coincide, then $A\otimes_R B$ is again an $R$-module, while if $R$ is not commutative then $A\otimes_R B$ will no longer be an $R$-module of any sort.

## Properties

### Monoidal category structure

The category $R$[[Mod]] equipped with the tensor product of modules $\otimes_R$ becomes a [[monoidal category]].

###### Proposition

A [[monoid]] in $(R Mod, \otimes)$ is equivalently an $R$-[[associative algebra|algebra]].
