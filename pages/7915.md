## Idea

A _contact manifold_ is a [[smooth manifold]] $P$ of odd [[dimension]] $2n+1$ which is equipped with a [[differential form|differential 1-form]] $A$ that is non-degenrate in the sense that the [[wedge product]] $A \wedge (d_{dR} A)^{\wedge^n}$ does not vanish.

The special case of _regular_ contact manifolds $(P,A)$ are essentially equivalent to the total spaces of [[circle bundles]] $P \to X$ over an $2n$-dimensional manifold equipped with a [[connection on a bundle|connection]] such that $A$ is the corresponding [[Ehresmann connection]] 1-form on the total space ([BoothbyWang (1958)](#BoothbyWang)). 

If in this case the [[curvature]] 2-form $\omega$ on $X$ makes the base space $X$ into a [[symplectic manifold]], then $(P,A)$ is a corresponding [[prequantum circle bundle]] that provides a [[geometric prequantization]] of $(X,\omega)$. 

A [[diffeomorphism]] $f : P \to P$ of a contact manifold $(P,A)$ is called a _contactomorphism_ (in analogy with _[[symplectomorphism]]_) if it preserves the 1-form $A$ up to multiplication by a function. If $(P,A)$ is regular and hence a [[prequantum line bundle]] a contactomorphism that strictly preserves the connection 1-form is called a _[[quantomorphism]]_. The [[Lie algebra]] of the [[quantomorphism group]] is that of the [[Poisson algebra]] of the base symplectic manifold $(X,\omega)$. 

## History
 {#History}

> The following is taken from ([Lin](#Lin)).

Originated in [[Hamiltonian mechanics]] and [[geometric optics]], contact geometry caught geometers' attention very earlier. In 1953, [[Shiing-shen Chern]] showed that the structure of a contact manifold $M^{2n+1}$ can be reduced to the [[unitary group]] $U(n)$ and therefore all
of its odd [[characteristic classes]] vanish1. Since all the characteristic classes of a closed, orientable 3-manifold vanish, Chern posed the question of whether such a manifold always admits a contact structure and whehter there are non-isomorphic contact structures on
one manifold in 1966.

One of the milestones in the study of contact geometry is Bennequin's proof of the existence of exotic contact structures (i. e., contact structures not isomorphic to the standard one) on $\mathbb{R}^3$. Bennequin recognized that the induced singular [[foliation]] on a [[surface]] [[embedding|embedded]] in a contact 3-manifold plays a crucial role for the classication of contact structures. This role was further explored in the work of Eliashberg, who distinguished two classes of contact structures in dimension 3, overtwisted and tight, and gave a homotopy classication for overtwisted contact structures on 3-manifolds. Eliashberg also proved that on $\mathbb{R}^3$ and $S^3$, the standard contact structure is the only tight contact structure.
