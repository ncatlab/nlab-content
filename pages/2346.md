The __graph__ of a [[function]] $f: X \to Y$ is a [[subset]] of the [[cartesian product]] $X \times Y$; $(a,b)$ belongs to the graph of $f$ if and only if $f(a) = b$.

It\'s easy to identify the properties of those subsets of $X \times Y$ that are the graphs of functions, and $f = g$ if they have the same graph (given $X$ and $Y$).  Consequently, it is common, especially (but not only) in material [[set theory]], to *define* a function from $X$ to $Y$ as such a subset, that is to identify a function with its graph.  On the other hand, from a more categorial foundation, it\'s common to define a [[subset]] to be a certain kind of function!

More generally, we can say that the __graph__ of a [[binary relation]] from $X$ to $Y$ is a subset of $X \times Y$; $(a,b)$ belongs to the graph if and only if $a$ is related to $b$.  The __graph__ of a [[relation]] of arbitrary arity is similarly a subset of an arbitrary [[cartesian product]]; see [[relation theory]] for more on this.  Note that *every* subset of $X \times Y$ defines a unique relation; this is the graph of a function if and only if the relation is both [[functional relation|functional]] and [[entire relation|entire]].


The graph of a binary relation from $X$ to $X$ is related to the notion of [[graph]] from [[graph theory]]; more precisely, such relations correspond to directed loop graphs (in the sense defined at [[graph]]) with vertex set $X$, and either can be defined as a subset of $X^2$.  In a similar way, [[spans]] from $X$ to $X$ correspond to [[digraph|directed pseudographs]] with vertex set $X$.

[[Bill Lawvere]] has also considered the __cograph__ of a function, which is dually a [[quotient set]] of the [[disjoint union]] $X \uplus Y$; $a$ is identified with $b$ if $f(a) = b$ (and additional identifications may follow).  This may be even more related to the sense of [[graph]] in graph theory; although the identifications are not done there, the cograph draws a picture in wich any relation (or [[multispan]]) of any arity becomes a directed loop graph (or directed pseudograph) whose vertex set is the disjoint union of the relation\'s domains.

[[Eric]]: I think it might be neat to take the opportunity here to relate **graph of a function** more explicitly to other things here on the nLab. As I read this, I thought of a category with one object (monoid in Set?) and one morphism

$$\bullet\righttoleftarrow f.$$

Then a graph (or is it cograph?) is a [[category of elements]] of this category.

Then you could maybe talk more generally about **graph of a morhism**. Or something...

_Toby_:  The above graph of a function definitely generalises to the graph of a morphism; I didn\'t say anything about it, because I didn\'t want to have to think about what categories it\'s possible to do this in.  (Probably a [[regular category]] or something like that.)

I don\'t understand what you\'re saying above.  You seem to introduce the [[trivial category]] and then ask for its category of elements.  Categories don\'t have categories of elements, objects of categories do; but this category has just one object, so I\'ll use that.  But the category of elements of that one object is also trivial.  The real problem is that nothing in this category has to do with any function $f: X \to Y$; all you\'ve done is label an abstract morphism with the same name ‘$f$’.  Can you try to explain again what you mean?

[[Eric]]: What I had in mind was to think of that one object $\bullet$ as a set (but didn't want to pin it down too much so I didn't say "set"). The morphism $f$ is a nontrivial [[endomorphism]].

When we [[category of elements|explode]] that simple category, we get one object (which will be a node of the graph) for each element in $\bullet$. We also get one morphism for any two elements $a$ and $b$ for which $f:a\to b$.

As usual, it is just an idea and I was hoping that if it made any sense at all we could clean it up and include it in the main text.

For example, let $\bullet = \{x,y,z\}$ and $f:\bullet\to\bullet$ with

$$\begin{aligned}
f(x) &= y \\
f(y) &= z \\
f(z) &= x.
\end{aligned}$$

When we "explode" this simple category 

$$Explode\left(\bullet\righttoleftarrow f\right)$$

we get a graph with three nodes and three directed edges forming a ring.

I guess, to be a little more explicit, I can call that [[concrete category]] $C$, i.e.

$$C = \bullet\righttoleftarrow f$$

_and_ we have a functor $F:C\to Set$. Then $F(\bullet)$ is really a set and $F(f)$ is really a function.

Then 

$$Explode(C) = Elem(F,C).$$

This [[category of elements]] seems to warrant being associated with the **graph of a function** $f$. Furthermore, this allows us to consider the **graph of an endomorphism**. But then, I could be confused.
