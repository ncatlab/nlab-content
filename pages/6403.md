## Idea

A _Killing spinor_ on a ([[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo]]-)[[Riemannian manifold]] is a _covariantly constant [[spinor]]_ : a [[section]] of some [[spinor bundle]] $v \in \Gamma(S)$ that is annihilated by  the [[covariant derivative]] of the corresponding [[Levi-Civita connection]].


Similarly a _[[Killing vector]]_ is a covariantly constant [[vector field]].
