## Definitions

Recall that a [[topological space]] is a [[set]] $X$ equipped with a [[topological structure]] $\mathcal{T}$.  Well, a __bitopological space__ is simply a set equipped with *two* topological structures $(X, \mathcal{T}, \mathcal{T}^*)$.  Unlike with [[bialgebras]], no compatibility condition is required between these structures.

A __bicontinous map__ is a [[function]] between bitopological spaces that is [[continuous map|continuous]] with respect to each topological structure.

Bitopological spaces and bicontinuous maps form a [[category]] $BiTop$.

## Separation axioms for topologies

Let $Cl$ denote the [[closure operator]] with respect to $\mathcal{T}$ and let $Cl^*$ denote the closure operator with respect to $\mathcal{T}^*$.

\begin{proposition}\label{implications}
Let $(X, \mathcal{T}, \mathcal{T}^*)$ be a bitopological space.
Consider the following properties of this space:

1. {#regular1} for each point $x$ there is a $\mathcal{T}$-[[neighborhood base]] consisting  of $\mathcal{T}^*$-closed sets; 

1. {#regular2} for all $x\in X$ and all $\mathcal{T}$-opens $U$ containing $x$ there is a $\mathcal{T}^*$-closed $\mathcal{T}$-neighborhood $V$ of $x$ such that $ V \subset U$;

1. {#coupled1} $Cl^*(O) \subset Cl(O)$ for each $\mathcal{T}^*$-open $O$; 

1. {#coupled2} for all $x\in X$ and all $\mathcal{T}$-neighborhoods $U$ of $x$ the closure $Cl^*(U)$ is a $\mathcal{T}^*$-neighborhood;

1. {#cotopology2} for each point $x$ and each $\mathcal{T}$-closed $\mathcal{T}$-neighborhood $V$ of $x$ in $X$ there exists a $\mathcal{T}^*$-closed $\mathcal{T}$-neighborhood $U$ of $x$ in $X$ such that $U$ is contained in $V$.

There are the following implications among these properties

\begin{centre}
  \begin{tikzcd}
	 & (2)	& (3) \\
	(5) & (1) & (4)
    \arrow[Rightarrow, from=2-1, to=1-2, "\text{if $\mathcal{T}$ regular}"] 
    \arrow[Leftrightarrow, from=1-2, to=2-2]
    \arrow[Leftrightarrow, from=1-3, to=2-3]
    \arrow[Rightarrow, from=2-2, to=2-1]
    \arrow[Rightarrow, from=1-3, to=1-2, "\text{if $\mathcal{T}$ regular}"]
    \arrow[Rightarrow, from=2-2, to=2-3]
\end{tikzcd}
\end{centre}

Especially, all properties are equivalent if $\mathcal{T}$ is [[regular space|regular]].
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
__[(1)](#regular1) $\iff$ [(2)](#regular2):__
Given a neighborhood base for a point $x$ as guaranteed by the first property. When you spell out the properties of this neighborhood base, you end up with the second property. For the reverse direction start with an arbitrary $\mathcal{T}$-neighborhood base of a point $x$ consisting of open. Apply the second property to every element of this neighborhood base to the desired neighborhood base.

__[(3)](#coupled1) $\iff$ [(4)](#coupled2):__
Suppose property [(3)](#coupled1), and let $U$ be a $\mathcal{T}$-neighborhood of an arbitrary point $x$. Then the [[complement]] $ \widetilde{Cl^*(U)} $ is in $\mathcal{T}^*$, so that $ Cl^*(\widetilde{Cl^*U}) \subset Cl(\widetilde{Cl^* U}) $ by the first property. Hence $ \widetilde{Cl(\widetilde{Cl^*U})} \subset \widetilde{Cl^*(\widetilde{Cl^* U})} $ for the complements.
Since $U$ is a $\mathcal{T}$-neighborhood of $x$, $x$ does not belong to $Cl(\widetilde{Cl^*U})$. 
Moreover, $\widetilde{Cl^*(\widetilde{Cl^*U})} $ is $\mathcal{T}^*$-open and a subset of $ Cl^*(U)$.
Hence $Cl^*(U)$ is a $\mathcal{T}^*$-neighborhood of $x$.

For the converse suppose property [(4)](#coupled2). Let $O$ be a nonempty $\mathcal{T}^*$-open set and $x$ an element of $Cl^*(O)$. Then if $U$ is any $\mathcal{T}$-neighborhood of $x$, some point $y \in O$ belongs to $Cl^*(U)$ due to the second property. Hence, as $O$ is a $\mathcal{T}^*$-neighborhood of $y$, some point of $U$ belongs to $O$. Thus $x \in Cl(O)$, and therefore $Cl^*(G) \subset Cl(O)$. 

__[(1)](#regular1) $\implies$ [(4)](#coupled2):__
Given $x\in X$ and a $\mathcal{T}$-neighborhood $U$ by property [(1)](#regular1) there is a $\mathcal{T}^*$-open $O \subset U$ containing $x$. Hence $O \subset Cl^*(U)$, and $Cl^*(U)$ is a $\mathcal{T}^*$-neighborhood. 

__[(3)](#coupled1) and $\mathcal{T}$ regular $\implies$ [(2)](#regular2):__
Let $x\in X$ and $U$ be a $\mathcal{T}$-open containing $x$. 
By regularity of $\mathcal{T}$ we can find disjoint $\mathcal{T}$-opens $V' \ni x$ and $U' \supset \tilde{U}$ ($\tilde{U}$ denotes the [[complement]]). Set $V \coloneqq Cl^*(V')$. This set is obviously a $\mathcal{T}^*$-closed $\mathcal{T}$-neighborhood of $x$. Due to property [(3)](#coupled1) $V \subset Cl(V')$. Since also $Cl(V') \subset \widetilde{U'}$, we have $V \subset U$. This is to say that $V$ is the $\mathcal{T}$-neighborhood we sought.

__[(5)](#cotopology2) and $\mathcal{T}$ regular $\implies$ [(2)](#regular2):__
Let $x\in X$ and $U$ be a $\mathcal{T}$-open containing $x$. By regularity of $\mathcal{T}$ we can find disjoint $\mathcal{T}$-opens $V' \ni x$ and $U' \supset \tilde{U}$ ($\tilde{U}$ denotes the [[complement]]). Due to property [(5)](#cotopology2) the closed set $\widetilde{U'}$ contains a $\mathcal{T}^*$-closed neighborhood of $x$. This is the neighborhood we sought. 

__[(1)](#regular1) $\implies$ [(5)](#cotopology2):__
Given some $\mathcal{T}$-closed $\mathcal{T}$-neighborhood $V$ of some point $x$ choose a neighborhood base according to property [(1)](#regular1) and take an element $U$ therein that is contained in $V$.
\end{proof}


\begin{definition}\label{regular}
Let $(X, \mathcal{T}, \mathcal{T}^*)$ be a bitopological space.
The topology $\mathcal{T}$ is __regular with respect to__ $\mathcal{T}^*$ if  one of the two equivalent conditions [(1)](#regular1) and [(2)](#regular2) from proposition \ref{implications} holds.
A bitopological space $(X, \mathcal{T}, \mathcal{T}^*)$ is called __pairwise regular__ if $\mathcal{T}$ is regular with respect to $\mathcal{T}^*$ and vise versa.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\label{coupled}
Let $(X, \mathcal{T}, \mathcal{T}^*)$ be a bitopological space.
The topology $\mathcal{T}^*$ is __coupled to__ $\mathcal{T}$ if one of the two equivalent conditions [(3)](#coupled1) and [(4)](#coupled2) from proposition \ref{implications} holds.
\end{definition}

Not that is if $\mathcal{T}^*$ is coupled to a finer topology $\mathcal{T} \supset \mathcal{T}^*$ then $\mathcal{T}^*$ is coupled to every topology coarser than $\mathcal{T}$ due to property [(3)](#coupled1). Moreover in this case also $\mathcal{T}$ is coupled to $\mathcal{T}^*$ (again a direct consequence of property [(3)](#coupled1)).

\begin{definition}\label{cotopology}
Let $(X, \mathcal{T}, \mathcal{T}^*)$ be a bitopological space.
The topology $\mathcal{T}^*$ is called a __[[cotopology]] of__ $\mathcal{T}$ if $\mathcal{T}^* \subseteq \mathcal{T}$ and property [(5)](#cotopology2) from proposition \ref{implications} holds.
The space $(X, \mathcal{T}^*)$ is also called a __cospace__ of $(X, \mathcal{T}$.
\end{definition}



## Remarks

It is interesting and perhaps surprising that many advanced topological notions can be described using bitopological spaces, even when you would not na&#239;vely think that there are two topologies around.  (At least, that\'s my vague memory of what they were good for.  I think that this was in some article by Isbell.)
