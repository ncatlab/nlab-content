# Idea #

For $C$ a [[model category]] and $D$ any [[small category]] there are two "obvious" ways to put a [[model category]] structures on the [[functor category]] $[D,C]$, called the _projective_ and the _injective_ model structure.  For completely general $C$, neither one need exist.  The projective model structure exists as long as $C$ is [[cofibrantly generated model category|cofibrantly generated]], while the injective model structure exists as long as $C$ is [[combinatorial model category|combinatorial]].

A related kind of model structure is the [[Reedy model structure]] on functor categories, which applies for *any* model category $C$, but requires $D$ to be a very special sort of category.  See the link for further information.

In the special case that $C = $ [[SSet]] is the standard [[model structure on simplicial sets|model category of simplicial sets]] the projective and injective model structure on the functor categories $[D,SSet]$ are described in more detail at [[global model structure on simplicial presheaves]].

#Definition#

For $C$ a [[combinatorial model category]] (or, in the projective case, merely cofibrantly generated) and $D$ a [[small category]] there exists the following two (combinatorial) model category structures on the [[functor category]] $[D,C]$:

* the **projective** structure $[D,C]_{proj}$: weak equivalences and fibrations are the [[natural transformation]]s that are objectwise such morphisms in $C$. (The cofibrations are then defined by their [[weak factorization system|left lifting property]].)

* the **injective** structure $[D,C]_{inj}$: weak equivalences and cofibrations are the [[natural transformation]]s that are objectwise such morphisms in $C$. (The fibrations are then defined by their [[weak factorization system|right lifting property]].)

###### Proposition

For $C$ a [[combinatorial model category]] and $D$ a [[small category]] the projective and injective structures $[D,C]_{proj}$ and $[D,C]_{inj}$ are themselves [[combinatorial model category|combinatorial model categories]].
