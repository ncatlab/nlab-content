Given a [[bigebra]] $B$ over a field $k$ with comultplication $\Delta$, a $k$-vector subspace $I$ is a __biideal__ if it is two sided [[ideal]] (i.e. for all $b\in B$, $b I\subseteq I$ and $I b\subseteq I$) and a [[coideal]], i.e. $\Delta(I)\subseteq I\otimes B + B\otimes I$.

Quotient of a bigebra $B$ by a biideal $I$ is itself inheriting a canonical structure of a bigebra by taking representatives both for multiplication and for comultiplication of classes. This is the __quotient bigebra__.   

A __Hopf ideal__ is a biideal in a 
Hopf algebra which is invariant (as a set)
under the antipode map. A quotient bigebra of a Hopf algebra is 
a Hopf algebra iff the biideal is in fact a Hopf ideal.
