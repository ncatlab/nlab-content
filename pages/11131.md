## Idea

Constructive analysis is the incarnation of [[analysis]] in [[constructive mathematics]]. 

In applications in [[computer science]] one uses for instance the _[[completion monad]]_ for _exact_ computations with [[real numbers]] (as opposed to floating point arithmetic). Therefore one also sometimes speaks of _exact analysis_.
