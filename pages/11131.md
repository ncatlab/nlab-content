## Idea

Constructive analysis is the incarnation of [[analysis]] in [[constructive mathematics]]. Also known as _[[computable analysis]]_ (see there for more).

In applications in [[computer science]] one uses for instance the _[[completion monad]]_ for _exact_ computations with [[real numbers]] (as opposed to floating point arithmetic). Therefore one also sometimes speaks of _exact analysis_.

## References

The formulation of [[analysis]] in [[constructive mathematics]] was maybe inititated in

together with the basic notion of [[Bishop set]]/[[setoid]].
