

Every [[Lie group]] $G$ has a canonical [[representation]] on the [[vector space]] underlying its [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$, given by the [[derivative]] of its [[adjoint action]] at the neutral element. This is called the _adjoint representation_.


The [[associated bundles]] via the adjoint representation are called [[adjoint bundles]].
