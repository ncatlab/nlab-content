An evolution equation is an equation of the form
$$
   \partial_t f = L f
$$
where $\partial_t$ represents the partial derivative with respect to time, $L$ is a differential operator and $f$ is usually assumed to be an element of some [[topological vector space]]. Examples are the [[Schr√∂dinger equation]] and the [[Fokker-Planck equation]]. These equations describe the time evolution of a physical system, hence the name.
