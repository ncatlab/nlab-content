## Idea

The yoga of handling [[tensors]], in particular contracting them with each other; and in the case of [[tensor products]] of sections of a [[tangent bundle]] and [[cotangent bundle]] also the operations of [[differentiation]] of tensors, hence the generalization of "[[calculus]]" ([[analysis]]) from [[vectors]] to [[tensors]].
