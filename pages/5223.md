The page level above is [[math resources]]. 

Most of interesting people for nlab will have their own pages in $n$lab; many  of them keep their own articles and books there, but some do more. Thus **this will not be a general list of homepages of mathematicians**, but rather of those pages which have *particularly important or large collections* of articles, books and especially advanced **lecture notes** of major importance to $n$lab and in the areas of prime importance to $n$lab ([[sheaf|sheaves]], [[stack]]s, (higher) categories, modern geometry and [[homotopy theory]], [[algebraic topology]], foundations). Still let us keep the alphabetic order.

* [[David Ben-Zvi]] has a nice [geometric Langlands page](http://www.math.utexas.edu/users/benzvi/Langlands.html) and of many other [lecture notes](http://www.math.utexas.edu/users/benzvi/notes.html)

* [groupoid](http://wolfweb.unr.edu/homepage/ramazan/groupoid) homepage has various info on research on groupoids including list of addresses

* [[Jacob Lurie]]'s [website](http://www.math.harvard.edu/~lurie) has the latest editions of his papers (most of which are on arXiv but not all) of large importance to the subject of $n$lab

* [[Peter May]]: [books](http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/BOOKSMaster.html), [notes](http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/MISCMaster.html), [homepage, including talks](http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may)

* [[James Milne]]'s [math page](http://www.jmilne.org/math/index.html) has several books and lecture notes, mainly on [[algebra]] and algebraic geometry

* Daniel Murfet's [The Rising Sea](http://therisingsea.org/?page_id=3) is classified under [[math blogs]] but has large amount of neat and modern lecture notes on [[algebraic geometry]] and [[homological algebra]]

* [[Bodo Pareigis]] has [here](http://www.mathematik.uni-muenchen.de/~pareigis/pa_schft.html) several lecture notes on category theory, [[quantum group]]s, noncommutative geometry and [[Hopf algebra]]s

* Paul Smith's [noncommutative algebra and geometry page](http://www.math.washington.edu/~smith/Research/research.html) has a large list of links to homepages of geometers and algebraists

* [[Charles Weibel]] has [here](http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~weibel) lots of writings including a growing book on [[algebraic K-theory]] and lecture notes on motivic cohomology with Mazza and Voevodsky
