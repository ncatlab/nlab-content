## Idea

A _completion of a ring_ is a [[completion]] of a [[ring]] to a [[complete space|complete]] [[topological ring]].

Specifically, for $R$ a [[commutative ring]] and $I \subset R$ a [[maximal ideal]], then the [[limit]]

$$
  \widehat R_I \coloneqq \underset{\leftarrow}{\lim} (R/I^n)
$$

of the [[quotients]] of $R$ by all the powers of this ideal is the completion of $R$ at $I$.


## Exanples

* The [[p-adic integers]] are the completion of the ring of [[integers]] at the [[prime ideal]]  $(p) \subset \mathbb{Z}$.

* [[Atiyah-Segal completion theorem]]
