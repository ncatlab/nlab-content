## Idea

A _completion of a ring_ is a [[completion]] of a [[topological ring]] to a [[complete space|complete]] [[topological ring]], when possible. More generally, 
one completes a subring of some topological ring within the latter, or takes (what is sometimes equivalent) some limit in a suitable category of topological rings. 

An important type of example occurs for $R$ a [[commutative ring]] and $I \subset R$ a [[maximal ideal]]. Using the powers of $I$ to define the $I$-[[adic topology]] on $R$, then the [[limit]]

$$
  \widehat R_I \coloneqq \underset{\leftarrow}{\lim} (R/I^n)
$$

of the [[quotients]] of $R$ by all the powers of this ideal, $I$,  is the completion of $R$ at $I$.


## Examples

* The [[p-adic integers]] are the completion of the ring of [[integers]] at the [[prime ideal]]  $(p) \subset \mathbb{Z}$.

* [[Atiyah-Segal completion theorem]]
