###### Definition

A **local geometric morphism** $f : E \to S$ between [[topos]]es $E,S$ is 

*  a [[geometric morphism]]

   $$
    (f^* \dashv f_*) \colon E \stackrel{\overset{f^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{f_*}
    {\to}}  S
   $$

*  such that a further [[right adjoint]] $f^! : S \to E$ exists 

   $$
    (f^* \dashv f_* \dashv f^!) : 
    E
    \stackrel{\overset{f^*}{\leftarrow}}{\stackrel{\underset{f_*}{\to}}{\underset{f^!}{\leftarrow}}}
    S
   $$

*  and such that one, hence all, of the following equivalent conditions hold:

   1. The right adjoint $f^!$ is an $S$-[[indexed functor]].
   1. $f$ is [[connected geometric morphism|connected]], i.e. $f^*$ is [[full and faithful functor|fully faithful]].
   1. The right adjoint $f^!$ is fully faithful.
   1. The right adjoint $f^!$ is [[cartesian closed functor|cartesian closed]].

=--

When we regard $E$ as a topos over $S$, so that $f$ is regarded as its [[global section]] geometric morphism in the category of toposes over $S$, then we say that $E$ is a **local $S$-topos**.  In this case we may label the functors involved as

$$
  (Disc \dashv \Gamma \dashv Codisc) : 
    E
    \stackrel{\overset{Disc}{\leftarrow}}{\stackrel{\underset{\Gamma}{\to}}{\underset{Codisc}{\leftarrow}}}
    S
$$

to indicate that if we think of $\Gamma$ as sending a [[space]] to its underlying $S$-object of points by forgetting [[cohesive topos|cohesion]], then $Disc$ creates the [[discrete space]]/[[discrete object]] and $Codisc$ the [[codiscrete space]]/[[codiscrete object]] on an object in $S$.

This is especially common when $S=$ [[Set]], in which case the final condition is automatic since all functors are $Set$-indexed.


## Properties

### General

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The [[global section]] geometric morphism of any local $\mathcal{S}$-topos (over a [[base topos]] $\mathcal{S}$) is a [[Grothendieck fibration]] and a [[Grothendieck opfibration]].

=--

This appears in ([Shulman](#Shulman)).

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The [[Freyd cover]] of a [[topos]] is a [[local topos]], and in fact freely so. Every local topos is a [[retract]] of a Freyd cover.

=--

This appears as ([Johnstone, lemma C3.6.4](#Johnstone)).

### Homotopy dimension
 {#HomotopyDimension}

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

In a local [[sheaf topos]] over [[Set]], every [[inhabited object]] is globally inhabited:

every object $X$ for which the unique morphism $X \to *$ to the [[terminal object]] is an [[epimorphism]] has a [[global point]] $* \to X$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Since in a local topos the [[global section]] functor $\Gamma$ is a [[left adjoint]], it preserves [[epimorphisms]]. Since it is a right adjoint it preserves the terminal object. Therefore $\Gamma(X) \to \Gamma(*) \simeq *$ is an epimorphism in [[Set]], hence a [[surjection]], meaning that $\Gamma(X)$ is [[inhabited]]. Since $\Gamma(X) \simeq Hom(*,X)$ (see [[global section geometric morphism]]), the claim follows.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

In a [[topos]] every [[epimorphism]] is an [[effective epimorphism]]. Therefore $X \to *$ being an epi means that $X$ is a [[(-1)-connected]] object. Therefore the above statement says in terms of [[(infinity,1)-category theory]] that a non-trivial local topos has [[homotopy dimension]] 0.

The same is true for any [[local (infinity,1)-topos]].

=--



### Concrete sheaves

Every local topos $\Gamma : E \to S$ comes with a notion of [[concrete sheaves]], a [[reflective subcategory]] $Conc_\Gamma(E) \hookrightarrow E$ which factors the topos inclusion of $S$:

$$
  S 
   \stackrel{\overset{\Gamma}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{Codisc}{\hookrightarrow}}
  Conc_\Gamma(E) 
    \stackrel{\overset{Conc}{\leftarrow}}{\hookrightarrow}
  E
$$

and is a [[quasitopos]]. See [[concrete sheaf]] for details.

### Homotopy equivalence

Since a local geometric morphism has a [[left adjoint]] in the [[2-category]] [[Topos]], it is necessarily a [[homotopy equivalence of toposes]].

## Elementary Axiomatization
 {#ElementaryAxiomatization}

For any local topos $\Gamma \colon \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{S}$, the base topos $\mathcal{S}$ is equivalent to the [[category of sheaves]] for a [[Lawvere-Tierney topology]] $j$ on $\mathcal{E}$.  A sound and complete elementary [[axiomatization]] of local maps of (bounded) toposes can be given in terms of properties of topos $E$ and topology $j$ ([AwodeyBirkedal](#AwodeyBirkedal))

We discuss first

* [the setup](#SetupForAxiomatization)

and then

* [the axioms](#TheAxioms)

themselves.


### The setup
 {#SetupForAxiomatization}

Let $\mathcal{E}$ be an [[elementary topos]] equipped with a [[Lawvere-Tierney topology]] $j : \Omega \to \Omega$.

Write $V \mapsto \sharp  V$ for the $j$-closure operation on [[subobjects]] $V \hookrightarrow X$

$$
  \array{
    V &\to& {*}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \sharp  V &\to& &\to& {*}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow  &&  \downarrow 
    \\
    X &\stackrel{\chi_V}{\to}& \Omega 
    &\stackrel{j}{\to}&
    \Omega
  }
$$

Write

$$
  (Disc \dashv \Gamma)
  : 
  Sh_j(\mathcal{E})
   \stackrel{\overset{\Gamma}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{coDisc}{\to}}  
  \mathcal{E}
$$

for the [[reflective subcategory]] [[category of sheaves|of j-sheaves]].

+-- {: .num_defn #EssentialTopology}
###### Definition

We say that $j$ is an **[[essential geometric morphism|essential]] topology** if for all objects $X$ the closure operation $\sharp  : Sub(X) \to Sub(X)$ on [[posets of subobjects]] has a [[left adjoint]] $\flat \dashv \sharp $:

$$
  (U \hookrightarrow \sharp  V)
   \Leftrightarrow
  (\flat U \hookrightarrow V)
  \,.
$$

=--

This appears under the term "principal" in ([Awodey-Birkedal, def. 2.1](#AwodeyBirkedal)). 

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

We use the notation "$\flat$" and "$\sharp $" oppositely to the use on p.14 of [Awodey-Birkedal](#AwodeyBirkedal). Our convention is such that it harmonizes with the terminology at _[[cohesive topos]]_ and _[[cohesive (infinity,1)-topos]]_, where it makes interpretational sense to pronounce "$\flat$" as "flat".

=--

+-- {: .num_observation}
###### Observation

The left adjoints $\flat : Sub(X) \to Sub(X)$ for all $X \in \mathcal{E}$
extend to a functor $\flat : \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{E}$ on all of $\mathcal{E}$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

(...)

=--


+-- {: .num_prop #InternalCharacterizationOfLocalReflection}
###### Proposition

A [[Lawvere-Tierney topology]] $j$ is [essential](#EssentialTopology), $(\flat \dashv \sharp )$, precisely if for all objects $X$ there exists a least $\sharp $-[[dense subobject]] $U_X \hookrightarrow X$.

=--

This appears as ([AwodeyBirkedal, lemma 2.3](#AwodeyBirkedal)). 

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the discussion at [[category of sheaves]] we have that $\sharp $ is given by the composite

$$
  \sharp  : \mathcal{E} \stackrel{\Gamma}{\to} Sh_j(\mathcal{E}) \stackrel{coDisc}{\hookrightarrow} \mathcal{E}
  \,,
$$

where the first morphism is [[sheafification]] and the second is [[full and faithful functor|full and faithful]]. 

If now the [[left adjoint]] $\flat$ exists, it follows that this comes from a left adjoint $Disc$ to $\Gamma$ as

$$
  \flat
   : 
  \mathcal{E}
   \stackrel{\overset{Disc}{\hookleftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma}
{\to}}
  Sh_j(\mathcal{E})
  \stackrel{\overset{\Gamma}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{coDisc}{\hookrightarrow}}
  \mathcal{E}
  : 
  \sharp 
  \,.
$$

Therefore the $(Disc \dashv \Gamma)$-[[counit of an adjunction|counit]] provides morphisms

$$
  (\flat X \to X) = (\flat X \to U_x \hookrightarrow X)
  \,,
$$

whose [[image]] factorization $U_x \hookrightarrow X$
we claim provides the least dense subobjects. 

To show that $U_X$ is dense it is sufficient to show
that 

$$
  \sharp (\flat X \to X)
  = 
  (coDisc \Gamma Disc \Gamma \to coDisc \Gamma X)
$$

is an [[isomorphism]].

Composing this morphism with $coDisc$ of the $(Disc \dashv\Gamma)$-unit on $\Gamma X$ (which is an [[isomorphism]] since $Disc$ is a [[full and faithful functor]] by the discussion at [[adjoint triple]]) and using the $(Disc \dashv \Gamma)$ [[triangle identity]] we have 

$$
  coDisc(
    \Gamma X 
      \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
    \Gamma Disc \Gamma X
      \stackrel{}{\to}
    \Gamma X
  )
  = 
  coDisc ( \Gamma X \stackrel{Id}{\to} \Gamma X)
  \,.
$$

Using that also $coDisc$ is full and faithful and then [[2-out-of-3]] for [[isomorphisms]] it follows that $coDisc \Gamma Disc \Gamma X \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} coDisc \Gamma X$ hence

$$
  \sharp  \flat X \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} \sharp  X
$$

is indeed an isomorphism. 

Moreover, by one of the equivalent characterizations of [[reflective subcategories]] we have (...)


=--


+-- {: .num_defn #DiscreteObjects}
###### Definition

An object $X \in \mathcal{E}$ is called **discrete** if 
for all $\Gamma$-[[local isomorphisms]] $f : A \to B$ the induced morphism

$$
  \mathcal{E}(X,A) \to \mathcal{E}(X,B)
$$

is an [[isomorphism]] (of sets, hence a bijection).

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #ODiscreteObjects}
###### Definition

An object $X \in \mathcal{E}$ is called **o-discrete** if $\flat X \simeq X$.

=--

+-- {: .num_lemma }
###### Lemma

Every discrete object is o-discrete.

=--



### The axioms
 {#TheAxioms}

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

On $\mathcal{E}$ a [[elementary topos]] with [[Lawvere-Tierney topology]] $j$ consider the following axioms.

* **Axiom 1**. $j$ is [essential](#EssentialTopology).

* **Axiom 2 a**. There is an object $G \in \mathcal{E}$ such that every object is a [[subquotient]] of the [[product]] of a [discrete object](#DiscreteObjects) with $G$.

* **Axiom 2 b**. With $G$ as above, there is a discrete object $G'$ and an [[epimorphism]] $G' \to \flat G$.

* **Axiom 3**. For all [discrete objects](#DiscreteObjects) $D$, if the [[internal hom]] $[X,D]$ is  [o-discrete](#ODiscreteObjects), then $X$ is also discrete.

* **Axiom 4**. [Discrete objects](#DiscreteObjects) are closed under binary [[products]].

=--

+-- {: .num_theorem }
###### Theorem

These axioms characterize local geometric morphisms $\mathcal{E} \to Sh_j(\mathcal{E}) \simeq D_j(\mathcal{E})$.

If $G$ is fixed to be the terminal object (in which case Axiom 2 b becomes empty), then they characterize local and [[localic geometric morphisms]].

=--

This is ([Awodey-Birkedal, theorem 3.1](#AwodeyBirkedal)) together with the discussion around remark 3.7.

## Examples

### Easy examples

* If $X$ is a [[topological space]], or more generally a [[locale]], then $Sh(X)$ is local (over Set) iff $X$ has a [[focal point]], i.e. a point whose only [[neighborhood]] is the whole space.

* If $C$ is a small category with a [[terminal object]], then the [[presheaf topos]] $[C^{op},Set]$ is local.  The converse is true if $C$ is [[Cauchy complete category|Cauchy complete]].

### Sheaves on a local site

For $C$ a [[local site]], the [[category of sheaves]] $Sh(C)$ is a local topos over $Set$.

For instance [[CartSp]] is a local site. Objects in $Sh(C)$ are [[generalized smooth spaces]] such as [[diffeological space]]s.
The further right adjoint

$$
  Codisc : Set \to Sh(CartSp)
$$

is the functor that sends a set to the [[diffeological space]] on that set with _[[codiscrete space|codiscrete]]_ smooth structure (every map of sets is smooth). 


### Relative Realizability

Let $A$ be a partial combinatory algebra and let $A\sharp\subseteq A$ be 
a sub partial combinatory algebra of $A$. Then there is a
(localic) local geometric morphism from the [[relative realizability topos]]
$\mathrm{RT}(A,A\sharp)$ to the standard [[realizability topos]]
$\mathrm{RT}(A\sharp)$. 

### Localization

Let $LocTopos$ denote the 2-category of local [[Grothendieck toposes]] (over Set) with all geometric morphisms between them.  Let $PTopos$ denote the 2-category whose objects are [[pointed topos|pointed toposes]] (i.e. (Grothendieck) toposes $E$ equipped with a geometric morphism $s\colon Set\to E$), and whose morphisms are pairs $(f,\alpha)$ such that $f\colon E\to E'$ is a geometric morphism and $\alpha\colon s'\to f s$ is a (not necessarily invertible) geometric transformation.

Note that if $E$ is a local topos with global sections geometric morphism $e^*\dashv e_*$, then the adjunction $e_*\dashv e^!$ is also a geometric morphism $Set\to E$.  In this way we have a functor $LocTopos \to PTopos$, which is a full embedding, and turns out to have a [[right adjoint]]: this right adjoint is called the **localization** of a pointed topos at its specified point.  For example:

+-- {: .un_prop #LocalizationOfPresheafTopos}
###### Proposition

If $C$ is a [[small category]] and $U$ is an object of $C$, then the localization of the [[presheaf topos]] $[C^{op},Set]$ at the point induced by $U\colon 1\to C$ can be identified with the [[presheaf topos]] $[(C/U)^{op},Set]$ over the [[over category]] of $C$ over $U$. By the general properties of [[over topos]]es, this is equivalently the over-topos $PSh(C)/U$ (where $U$ is regarded in $PSh(C)$ by the [[Yoneda embedding]]).

=--

+-- {: .un_prop }
###### Proposition


If $X=Spec(A)$ is the [[Zariski spectrum]] of a [[commutative ring]] $A$, and $P\subset A$ is a prime ideal of $A$ (i.e. a point of $X$), then the localization of $Sh(X)$ at $P\colon 1\to X$ can be identified with $Sh(Spec(A_P))$, where $A_P$ denotes the [[localization]] of $A$ at $P$.  Of course, this is the origin of the terminology.

=--

A similar construction is possible for [[bounded geometric morphism|bounded]] toposes over any base (not just Set).


### Local over-toposes {#LocalOverTopoes}


+-- {: .un_prop }
###### Proposition

For $\mathcal{E}$ a [[topos]] and $X \in \mathcal{E}$ an object, the [[over topos]] $\mathcal{E}/X$ is local if $X$ is a [[tiny object]]. 

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We check that the [[global section]] [[geometric morphism]] $\Gamma : \mathcal{E}/X \to Set$ preserves [[colimit]]s. It is given by the [[hom-functor]] out of the [[terminal object]] of $\mathcal{E}/X$, which is $(X \stackrel{Id}{\to} X)$:

$$
  \Gamma : (A \stackrel{f}{\to} X) \mapsto Hom_{\mathcal{E}/X}(Id_X, f)
  \,.
$$

The [[hom-set]]s in the [[over category]] are [[fiber]]s of the hom-sets in $\mathcal{E}$: we have a [[pullback]] diagram

$$
  \array{
      Hom_{\mathcal{E}/X}(Id_X, (A \to X)) &\to&
       Hom_{\mathcal{E}}(X,A)
      \\
      \downarrow && \downarrow^{f_*}
      \\
      * &\stackrel{Id_x}{\to}& Hom_{\mathcal{E}}(X,X)
  }
  \,.
$$

Moreover, overserve that [[colimit]]s in the [[over category]] are computed in $\mathcal{E}$.

$$
  {\lim_{\to}}_i (A_i \stackrel{f_i}{\to} X)
  \simeq
  ({\lim_\to}_i A_i) \to X
  \,.
$$

If $X$ is a [[tiny object]] then by definition we have

$$
  Hom_{\mathcal{E}}(X, {\lim}_i A_i)
  \simeq
  {\lim_\to}_i Hom_{\mathcal{E}}(X, A_i)
  \,,
$$

Inserting all this into the above pullback gives the pullback

$$
  \array{
      Hom_{\mathcal{E}/X}(Id_X, {\lim_\to}_i (A_i \to X)) &\to&
       {\lim_\to}_i Hom_{\mathcal{E}}(X, A_i)
      \\
      \downarrow && \downarrow^{f_*}
      \\
      * &\stackrel{Id_x}{\to}& Hom_{\mathcal{E}}(X,X)
  }
  \,.
$$

By [[universal colimits]] in the topos [[Set]], this pullback of a colimit is the colimit of the separate pullbacks, so that

$$
  \Gamma({\lim_\to}_i (A_i \to X)))
  \simeq
  Hom_{\mathcal{E}/X}(Id_X, {\lim_\to}_i (A_i \to X))
   \simeq
  {\lim_\to}_i Hom_{\mathcal{E}/X}(Id_X,(A_i \to X))
  \simeq
  {\lim_\to}_i \Gamma(A_i \to X)
  \,.
$$

So $\Gamma$ does commute with colimits if $X$ is tiny. By the [[adjoint functor theorem]] then the [[right adjoint]] $\nabla : Set \to \mathcal{E}/X$ does exist and so $\mathcal{E}/X$ is a local topos.

=--


+-- {: .un_remark }
###### Remark

As a special case this reproduces the [above statement](#LocalizationOfPresheafTopos) that slices $PSh(C)/j(U)§ of presheaf toposes over objects in the image of the [[Yoneda embedding]] are local: every [[representable functor]] is [[tiny object|tiny]] (see there).
