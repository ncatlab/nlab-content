## Definition

A **local geometric morphism** $f : E \to S$ between [[topos]]es $E,S$ is 

*  a [[geometric morphism]]

   $$
    (f^* \dashv f_*) \colon E \stackrel{\overset{f^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{f_*}
    {\to}}  S
   $$

*  such that a further [[right adjoint]] $f^! : S \to E$ exists 

   $$
    (f^* \dashv f_* \dashv f^!) : 
    E
    \stackrel{\overset{f^*}{\leftarrow}}{\stackrel{\underset{f_*}{\to}}{\underset{f^!}{\leftarrow}}}
    S
   $$

*  and such that one, hence all, of the following equivalent conditions hold:

   1. The right adjoint $f^!$ is an $S$-[[indexed functor]].
   1. $f$ is [[connected geometric morphism|connected]], i.e. $f^*$ is [[full and faithful functor|fully faithful]].
   1. The right adjoint $f^!$ is fully faithful.
   1. The right adjoint $f^!$ is [[cartesian closed functor|cartesian closed]].

When we regard $E$ as a topos over $S$, so that $f$ is regarded as its [[global section]] geometric morphism in the category of toposes over $S$, then we say that $E$ is a **local $S$-topos**.  In this case we may label the functors involved as

$$
  (Disc \dashv \Gamma \dashv Codisc) : 
    E
    \stackrel{\overset{Disc}{\leftarrow}}{\stackrel{\underset{\Gamma}{\to}}{\underset{Codisc}{\leftarrow}}}
    S
$$

to indicate that if we think of $\Gamma$ as sending a [[space]] to its underlying $S$-object of points by forgetting [[cohesive topos|cohesion]], then $Disc$ creates the [[discrete space]] and $Codisc$ the [[codiscrete space]] on an object in $S$.

This is especially common when $S=$ [[Set]], in which case the final condition is automatic since all functors are $Set$-indexed.


## Properties

### Concrete sheaves

Every local topos $\Gamma : E \to S$ comes with a notion of [[concrete sheaves]], a [[reflective subcategory]] $Conc_\Gamma(E) \hookrightarrow E$ which factors the topos inclusion of $S$:

$$
  S 
   \stackrel{\overset{\Gamma}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{Codisc}{\hookrightarrow}}
  Conc_\Gamma(E) 
    \stackrel{\overset{Conc}{\leftarrow}}{\hookrightarrow}
  E
$$

and is a [[quasitopos]]. See [[concrete sheaf]] for details.

### Homotopy equivalence

Since a local geometric morphism has a [[left adjoint]] in the [[2-category]] [[Topos]], it is necessarily a [[homotopy equivalence of toposes]].

## Elementary Axiomatization

For every local topos $\Gamma : E \to S$, $S$ is equivalent to the 
category of sheaves for a Lawvere-Tierney topology $j$ on $E$.  A sound and complete elementary axiomatization of local maps of (bounded) 
toposes can be given in terms of properties of topos 
$E$ and topology $j$, see the paper by Awodey and Birkedal in the references below. 

## Examples

### Easy examples

* If $X$ is a [[topological space]], or more generally a [[locale]], then $Sh(X)$ is local (over Set) iff $X$ has a [[focal point]], i.e. a point whose only [[neighborhood]] is the whole space.

* If $C$ is a small category with a [[terminal object]], then the [[presheaf topos]] $[C^{op},Set]$ is local.  The converse is true if $C$ is [[Cauchy complete category|Cauchy complete]].

### Sheaves on a local site

For $C$ a [[local site]], the [[category of sheaves]] $Sh(C)$ is a local topos over $Set$.

For instance [[CartSp]] is a local site. Objects in $Sh(C)$ are [[generalized smooth spaces]] such as [[diffeological space]]s.
The further right adjoint

$$
  Codisc : Set \to Sh(CartSp)
$$

is the functor that sends a set to the [[diffeological space]] on that set with _[[codiscrete space|codiscrete]]_ smooth structure (every map of sets is smooth). 


### Relative Realizability

Let $A$ be a partial combinatory algebra and let $A\sharp\subseteq A$ be 
a sub partial combinatory algebra of $A$. Then there is a
(localic) local geometric morphism from the [[relative realizability topos]]
$\mathrm{RT}(A,A\sharp)$ to the standard [[realizability topos]]
$\mathrm{RT}(A\sharp)$. 

### Localization

Let $LocTopos$ denote the 2-category of local [[Grothendieck toposes]] (over Set) with all geometric morphisms between them.  Let $PTopos$ denote the 2-category whose objects are [[pointed topos|pointed toposes]] (i.e. (Grothendieck) toposes $E$ equipped with a geometric morphism $s\colon Set\to E$), and whose morphisms are pairs $(f,\alpha)$ such that $f\colon E\to E'$ is a geometric morphism and $\alpha\colon s'\to f s$ is a (not necessarily invertible) geometric transformation.

Note that if $E$ is a local topos with global sections geometric morphism $e^*\dashv e_*$, then the adjunction $e_*\dashv e^!$ is also a geometric morphism $Set\to E$.  In this way we have a functor $LocTopos \to PTopos$, which is a full embedding, and turns out to have a [[right adjoint]]: this right adjoint is called the **localization** of a pointed topos at its specified point.  For example:

+-- {: .un_prop #LocalizationOfPresheafTopos}
###### Proposition

If $C$ is a [[small category]] and $U$ is an object of $C$, then the localization of the [[presheaf topos]] $[C^{op},Set]$ at the point induced by $U\colon 1\to C$ can be identified with the [[presheaf topos]] $[(C/U)^{op},Set]$ over the [[over category]] of $C$ over $U$. By the general properties of [[over topos]]es, this is equivalently the over-topos $PSh(C)/U$ (where $U$ is regarded in $PSh(C)$ by the [[Yoneda embedding]]).

=--

+-- {: .un_prop }
###### Proposition


If $X=Spec(A)$ is the [[Zariski spectrum]] of a [[commutative ring]] $A$, and $P\subset A$ is a prime ideal of $A$ (i.e. a point of $X$), then the localization of $Sh(X)$ at $P\colon 1\to X$ can be identified with $Sh(Spec(A_P))$, where $A_P$ denotes the [[localization]] of $A$ at $P$.  Of course, this is the origin of the terminology.

A similar construction is possible for [[bounded geometric morphism|bounded]] toposes over any base (not just Set).


### Local over-toposes {#LocalOverTopoes}


+-- {: .un_prop }
###### Proposition

For $\mathcal{E}$ a [[topos]] and $X \in \mathcal{E}$ an object, the [[over topos]] $\mathcal{E}/X$ is local if $X$ is a [[tiny object]]. 

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We check that the [[global section]] [[geometric morphism]] $\Gamma : \mathcal{E}/X \to Set$ preserves [[colimit]]s. It is given by the [[hom-functor]] out of the [[terminal object]] of $\mathcal{E}/X$, which is $(X \stackrel{Id}{\to} X)$:

$$
  \Gamma : (A \stackrel{f}{\to} X) \mapsto Hom_{\mathcal{E}/X}(Id_X, f)
  \,.
$$

The [[hom-set]]s in the [[over category]] are [[fiber]]s of the hom-sets in $\mathcal{E}$: we have a [[pullback]] diagram

$$
  \array{
      Hom_{\mathcal{E}/X}(Id_X, (A \to X)) &\to&
       Hom_{\mathcal{E}}(X,A)
      \\
      \downarrow && \downarrow^{f_*}
      \\
      * &\stackrel{Id_x}{\to}& Hom_{\mathcal{E}}(X,X)
  }
  \,.
$$

Moreover, overserve that [[colimit]]s in the [[over category]] are computed in $\mathcal{E}$.

$$
  {\lim_{\to}}_i (A_i \stackrel{f_i}{\to} X)
  \simeq
  ({\lim_\to}_i A_i) \to X
  \,.
$$

If $X$ is a [[tiny object]] then by definition we have

$$
  Hom_{\mathcal{E}}(X, {\lim}_i A_i)
  \simeq
  {\lim_\to}_i Hom_{\mathcal{E}}(X, A_i)
  \,,
$$

Inserting all this into the above pullback gives the pullback

$$
  \array{
      Hom_{\mathcal{E}/X}(Id_X, {\lim_\to}_i (A_i \to X)) &\to&
       {\lim_\to}_i Hom_{\mathcal{E}}(X, A_i)
      \\
      \downarrow && \downarrow^{f_*}
      \\
      * &\stackrel{Id_x}{\to}& Hom_{\mathcal{E}}(X,X)
  }
  \,.
$$

By [[universal colimits]] in the topos [[Set]], this pullback of a colimit is the colimit of the separate pullbacks, so that

$$
  \Gamma({\lim_\to}_i (A_i \to X)))
  \simeq
  Hom_{\mathcal{E}/X}(Id_X, {\lim_\to}_i (A_i \to X))
   \simeq
  {\lim_\to}_i Hom_{\mathcal{E}/X}(Id_X,(A_i \to X))
  \simeq
  {\lim_\to}_i \Gamma(A_i \to X)
  \,.
$$

So $\Gamma$ does commute with colimits if $X$ is tiny. By the [[adjoint functor theorem]] then the [[right adjoint]] $\nabla : Set \to \mathcal{E}/X$ does exist and so $\mathcal{E}/X$ is a local topos.

+-- {: .un_remark }
###### Remark

As a special case this reproduces the [above statement](#LocalizationOfPresheafTopos) that slices $PSh(C)/j(U)§ of presheaf toposes over objects in the image of the [[Yoneda embedding]] are local: every [[representable functor]] is [[tiny object|tiny]] (see there).
