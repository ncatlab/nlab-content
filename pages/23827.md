## Idea

In [[physics]] by an "internal symmetry" one broadly means a [[symmetry]] *other* than spacetime symmetry, i.e. a symmetry not due to nor reflecting movement in space and time, but due to "internal degrees of freedom".

### In high energy physics

Notably [[gauge symmetry]] is counted as internal symmetry.

Or a [[spinor]] field, in the absence of any [[magnetic field]] or [[spin-orbit interaction]] or any other [[interaction]] involving the spin will have a [[dynamics]] which is invariant under transformations that just flips the spin, and this is then an internal symmetry.

### In solid state physics

In [[condensed matter theory]], internal symmetries are also referred to as "on-site" symmetries, this referring to the sites of the atomic nuclei in the [[crystal]] lattice.

Beware that old historical articles (eg. [Barlow 1883](crystal#Barlow1883)) used "internal symmetry" to refer to [[crystallographic group|crystallographic symmetry]] which now is referred to as "spatial symmetry" and regarded as non-internal.
