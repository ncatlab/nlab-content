## Definition

A [[chain complex]] $V$ is called _contractible_ if the unique [[terminal object|terminal]] [[morphism]] $V \to 0$ to the [[zero object|zero complex]] is a [[homotopy equivalence]], hence if the [[identity morphism]] on $V$ is [[null homotopy|null homotopic]]. One also says that $V$ is _null-homotopic_.

It is called _weakly contractible_ if $V \to 0$ is a [[quasi-isomorphism]].

## Examples

Every [[mapping cone]] on an [[identity morphism|identity]] [[chain map]] is contractible.
