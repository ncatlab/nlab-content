## Idea

A _Gerstenhaber algebra_ is a [[Poisson n-algebra|Poisson 2-algebra]], a [[Poisson algebra]] in graded vector spaces with Poisson bracket of degree -1.

## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition


A **Gerstenhaber algebra** is a [[chain complex]] $A$ equipped with

* a symmetric product $\cdot : A \otimes A \to A$;

* a skew-symmetric bracket $[-,-] : A \otimes A \to A[1]$;

* such that [[associativity]] of $\cdot$ and the [[Jacobi identity]] for $[-,-]$ holds and such that $[a,-]$ is a [[derivation]] of $\cdot$.

## Properties

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

The [[homology]] of the  [[operad]] for Gerstenhaber algebras in [[chain complexes]] is the operad for Gerstenhaber algebras.

Accordingly the [[homology]] of an [[E2-algebra]] is a Gerstenhaber algebra.

This is due to [Cohen (1976)](#Cohen).

###### Remark

A Gerstenhaber algebra equipped in addition with a certain morphism $\Delta : A \to A$ is a **[[BV-algebra]]**. This is the homology of an algebra over the [[framed little 2-disk operad]].
