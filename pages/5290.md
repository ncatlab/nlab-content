## Idea

A _Gerstenhaber algebra_ is essentially a [[Poisson algebra]] [[internalization|internal]] to a [[category of chain complexes]].

## Definition

###### Definition


A **Gerstenhaber algebra** is a [[chain complex]] $A$ equipped with

* a symmetric product $\cdot : A \otimes A \to A$;

* a skew-symmetric bracket $[-,-] : A \otimes A \to A[1]$;

* such that [[associativity]] of $\cdot$ and the [[Jacobi identity]] for $[-,-]$ holds and such that $[a,-]$ is a [[derivation]] of $\cdot$.

A Gerstenhaber algebra equipped in addition with a certain morphism $\Delta : A \to A$ is a **[[BV-algebra]]**.
