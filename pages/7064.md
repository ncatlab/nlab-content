## Idea

The [[homotopy groups]] of [[spheres]] $\pi_{n+k}(S^n)$ are the [[homotopy classes]] of maps $S^{n+k} \longrightarrow S^n$

$$
  \pi_{n+k}(S^n) \coloneqq [S^k, S^n]
  \,.
$$

For fixed $k$, the [[colimit]] over $n$ with respect to the [[suspension]] homomorphism

$$
  \pi_{n+k}(S^n) \longrightarrow \pi_{n+k+1}(S^{n+1})
$$

over all $\pi_{n+k}(S^n)$ (called the $k$-[[stem]]) is called the _[[stable homotopy groups]] of spheres_ (also: the "stable $k$-[[stem]]")

$$
  \pi_k^S = \coloneqq \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_n \pi_{n+k}(S^n)  
 \,.
$$

In fact, by the [[Freudenthal suspension theorem]], the value of the $\pi_{n+k}(S^n)$ stabilizes for $n \gt k+1$ (depend only on $k$ in this range), whence the name.

The [[stable homotopy groups]] of sphere are equivalently the [[homotopy groups of a spectrum]] for the [[sphere spectrum]] $\mathbb{S}$

$$
  \pi_k^S = \pi_k(\mathbb{S})
  \,.
$$

The stable homotopy groups of spheres are notorious for their immense computational richness. Many of the tools of [[algebraic topology]] and [[stable homotopy theory]] were devised to compute more and more of the stable stems. This notably include the [[Adams spectral sequence]], the [[Adams-Novikov spectral sequence]].

## Tables

| $k =$ | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4  | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | $\cdots$ | 
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| $\pi_k(\mathbb{S}) = $ | $\mathbb{Z}$  | $\mathbb{Z}_2$  |  $\mathbb{Z}_2$ |  $\mathbb{Z}_{24}$ |  $0$ |  $0$ | $\mathbb{Z}_2$ |   $\mathbb{Z}_{240}$ | $(\mathbb{Z}_2)^2$ |  $(\mathbb{Z}_2)^3$ | $\mathbb{Z}_6$ | $\mathbb{Z}_{504}$ | $0$ | $\mathbb{Z}_3$ | $(\mathbb{Z}_2)^2$ | $\mathbb{Z}_{480} \oplus \mathbb{Z}_2$ | $\cdots$ |

The following tables for the [[p-primary components]] of $\pi_\bullet$ in low degrees  are taken from ([Hatcher](#Hatcher)), where in turn they were generated based on ([Ravenel 86](#Ravenel86)).

The horizontal index is the degree $n$ of the stable homotopy group $\pi_n$. The appearance of a string of $k$ connected dots vertically above index $n$ means that there is a [[direct sum|direct summand]] [[primary group]] of [[order of a group|order]] $p^k$. The bottom rows in each case are given by the [[image of the J-homomorphism]].
See example \ref{InterpretTable} below for illustration (graphics taken from [Hatcher's website](http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/)).

###### Example


The [[finite abelian group]] $\pi_3(\mathbb{S}) \simeq \mathbb{Z}_{24}$ decomposes into [[primary groups]] as $\simeq \mathbb{Z}_8 \oplus \mathbb{Z}_3$. Here $8 = 2^3$ corresponds to the three dots above $n = 3$ in the first table, and $3 = 3^1$ to the single dot over $n = 3$ in the second.

The [[finite abelian group]] $\pi_7(\mathbb{S}) \simeq \mathbb{Z}_{24}$ decomposes into [[primary groups]] as $\simeq \mathbb{Z}_{16} \oplus \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \mathbb{Z}_5$. Here $16 = 2^4$ corresponds to the four dots above $n = 7$ in the first table, and $3 = 3^1$ to the single dot over $n = 7$ in the second and $5 = 5^1$ to the single dot over $n = 7$ in the third table.

###### Theorem

The [[homotopy group]] $\pi_{n+k}(S^k)$ is a [[finite group]] for $k \gt 0$ except when $n = 2m$ and $k = 2m -1$ in which case

$$
  \pi_{4m -1 }(S^{2m}) \simeq \mathbb{Z} \oplus F_m

### J-homomorphism and Adams e-invariant

The following characterizes the [[image]] of the [[J-homomorphism]] 

$$
  J \;\colon\; \pi_\bullet(O) \longrightarrow \pi_\bullet(\mathbb{S})
$$

from the [[homotopy groups]] of the [[stable orthogonal group]] to the stable homotopy groups of spheres. This was first conjectured in ([Adams 66](#Adams66)) (since called the _Adams conjecture_) and then proven in ([Quillen 71](#Quillen71)).

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

By the discussion at _[orthogonal group -- homotopy groups](orthogonal%20group#HomotopyGroups)_ we have that the [[homotopy groups]] of the [[stable orthogonal group]] are 

| $n\;mod\; 8$ | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| $\pi_n(O)$ | $\mathbb{Z}_2$ | $\mathbb{Z}_2$ |0 | $\mathbb{Z}$ | 0 | 0 | 0 | $\mathbb{Z}$ |

Because all groups appearing here and in the following are [[cyclic groups]], we instead write down the [[order of a group|order]]

| $n\;mod\; 8$ | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ${\vert\pi_n(O)\vert}$ | 2 | 2 | 1 | $\infty$ | 1 | 1 | 1 | $\infty$ |

###### Theorem

The [[stable homotopy groups of spheres]] $\pi_n(\mathbb{S})$ are the [[direct sum]] of the ([[cyclic group|cyclic]]) [[image]] of the 
[[J-homomorphism]], and the [[kernel]] of the [[Adams e-invariant]].

Moreover,

* for $n = 0 \;mod \;$ and $n = 1 \;mod \; 8$ and $n$ positive the J-homomorphism is [[injection|injective]], hence its image is $\mathbb{Z}_2$, 

* for $n = 3\; mod\; 8$ and $n = 7 \; mod \; 8$ hence for $n = 4 k -1$, the [[order of a group|order]] of the image is equal to the [[denominator]] of $B_{2k}/4k$, where $B_{2k}$ is the [[Bernoulli number]]

* for all other cases the image is necessarily zero.
