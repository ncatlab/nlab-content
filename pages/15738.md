## Idea

The [[renormalization group flow]] of the [[coupling constants]] of the three [[gauge field|gauge]] [[forces]] of the [[standard model of particle physics]] come close to all intersecting at a single point at some high energy. This observation has led to the speculation that there ought to be a refinement of the standard model such as [[GUT]]-theories and/or [[supersymmetry]]-extensions such as the [[MSSM]] in which the gauge coupling constants unify exactly at high energy. This idea is called _gauge coupling unification_.
