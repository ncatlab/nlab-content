## Idea

Given a finite dimensional (pseudo)-[[Riemannian manifold]] $(X,g)$, the _Hodge star operator_ "completes" a $k$-[[differential form]] to the [[volume form]] of $(X,g)$. 


## Definition

Let $(X,g)$ be an [[orientation|oriented]] $n$-dimensional [[smooth manifold]] $X$ endowed with a nondegenerate symmetric [[bilinear form]] $g$.  The **Hodge star operator** is the linear operator ${*}\colon \Omega^k X \to \Omega^{n-k} X$ defined by the identity

$$
\alpha \wedge *\beta = (\alpha \mid \beta) vol, \qquad \forall \alpha,\beta \in \bigwedge^k X,
$$

where $(\mid)$ is the nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form induced by $g$ on $\Omega^k X$ and $vol \in \Omega^n X$ is the [[volume form]] induced by $g$.

If $e_1,\dots,e_n$ is a [[local frame|local basis]] on $X$ and $e^1,\dots,e^n$ is the [[dual basis]], so that $\alpha = \frac{1}{k!} \alpha_{i_1,\dots,i_k} e^{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge e^{i_k}$, then

$$
*\alpha = \frac{1}{k!(n-k)!} \epsilon_{i_1,\dots,i_n} \sqrt{|det(g)|} \alpha_{j_1,\dots,j_k} g^{i_1,j_1} \cdots g^{i_k,j_k} e^{i_{k+1}} \wedge \cdots \wedge e^{i_n},
$$

where $\epsilon_{i_1,\dots,i_n}$ is the [[signature of a permutation|sign]] of the [[permutation]] $(1,2,\dots,n)\mapsto (i_1,i_2,\dots,i_n)$ and $det(g)$ is the [[determinant]] of $g$ in the local basis.


## Properties

Let $(X,g)$ be a [[Riemannian manifold]] of [[dimension]] $n$ and let $\omega,\lambda \in \Omega^k(X)$. Then

* $*(*\omega) = (-1)^{k(n+1)} \omega = (-1)^{k(n-k)} \omega$;

* $(*\omega | *\lambda) = (\omega | \lambda)$;

* $*1 = vol$.


## Generalisations

The [[Riemannian metric|metric]] $g$ is used in two places in the specification of the Hodge operator: in the inner product on forms and in the volume form.  If $X$ is equipped only with a [[volume form]] (not necessarily coming from a metric), then the Hodge operator still takes $k$-forms to $(n-k)$-[[multivector field|vector fields]].  If the manifold is not oriented, then the metric only gives a [[volume pseudoform]], but the Hodge operator still takes $k$-forms to $(n-k)$-pseudoforms.  Finally, if $X$ is equipped with only a volume pseudoform (which is equivalent to an [[absolutely continuous measure|absolutely continuous]] [[Radon measure]] on $X$), then the Hodge operator takes $k$-forms to $(n-k)$-pseudovector fields.  (Of course, in every case, one might apply the operator to pseudoforms or multivector fields to begin with.)
