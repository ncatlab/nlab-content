## Idea

The notion of _essentially small $(\infty,1)$-category_ is the generalization of the notion of [[small category]] from [[category theory]] to [[(∞,1)-category]] theory.


## Definitions

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition
  
A [[quasi-category]] $C$ is **essentially $\kappa$-small** for some [[regular cardinal]] $\kappa$ if 

1. the collection of [[equivalence in a quasi-category|equivalence classes]] in $C$ is $\kappa$-small;

2. for every morphism $f : x \to y$ in $C$ the [[simplicial homotopy group|homotopy sets]] of the [[hom-object in a quasi-category|hom ∞-groupoid]] at $f$ (that is, the  sets $\pi_i(Hom^R(x,y),f)$) are $\kappa$-small.

$C$ is **essentially small** if the above conditions hold "absolutely," i.e. with "$\kappa$-small" replaced by "small."

This appears as [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, def. 5.4.1.3, prop. 5.4.1.2]].

In the presence of the [[regular extension axiom]] (which follows from the [[axiom of choice]]), essential smallness is equivalent to being essentially $\kappa$-small for some small [[regular cardinal]] $\kappa$.

## Properties

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

Let $C$ be an $(\infty,1)$-category and $\kappa$ an uncountable [[regular cardinal]]. The following are equivalent:

1. $C$ is $\kappa$-small.

2. $C$ is a $\kappa$-[[compact object in an (infinity,1)-category|compact object]] in [[(∞,1)Cat]].

3. $C$ is equivalently given by a [[quasi-category]] whose underlying [[simplicial set]] is $\kappa$-small.

This is [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, prop. 5.4.1.2]]
