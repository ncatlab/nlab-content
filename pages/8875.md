Given a field $k$ an __affine algebra__ is any finitely generated [[noetherian ring|noetherian]] associative commutative unital $k$-algebra without [[nilpotent elements]]. This term is limited to a small community of algebraists and may bring confusion if quoted outside of that context. The name is from the fact that the affine algebras are the coordinate rings of [[affine varieties]]; equivalently, an affine $k$-variety is precisely the [[maximal spectrum]] of an affine $k$-algebra.

Some people drop the condition of commutativity and talk about noncommutative affine algebras. This is even less standard as in the noncommutative context there is a further hesitation to drop noetherianess as well. 

Yet another confusion may arise when people informally say affine algebra for an [[affine Lie algebra]]; of course, the latter, full, term is preferred (or "affine Kac-Moody algebra").
