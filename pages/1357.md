## Idea

A _Verdier site_ is a [[site]] with an extra condition on the [[coverage]] that ensures that one can refine every [[hypercover]] in the context of [[simplicial presheaf|simplicial prsheaves]] on that site in a particularly nice.

For a discussion of the use of Verdier sites see [[descent]].

## Definition

A **Verdier site** is a [[site]] such that for every morphism $U \to X$ which is part of a covering [[sieve]] on $X$, also 

$$
  U \stackrel{Id_U \times_X Id_U}{\to} U \times_X U
$$

is in a covering [[sieve]] of $U \times_X U$.
