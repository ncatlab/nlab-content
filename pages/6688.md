## Definition

For $(X,g)$ a ([[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo-]])[[Riemannian manifold]] a **Killing [[tensor]]** is a [[section]] of a symmetric power of the [[tangent bundle]]

$$
  K \in Sym^k \Gamma(T X)
$$

which is covariantly constant in that

$$
  \nabla_{(\mu K_{\alpha_1, \cdots, \alpha_k}) = 0
  \,.
$$

For $k = 1$ this reduces to the notion of [[Killing vector]].

## Properties

For every Killing tensor $K$ on $(X,g)$ the [[dynamics]] of the [[relativistic particle]] on $X$ has a further conserved quantity. In the canonical case $K = g$ this quantity is the energy [[Hamiltonian]] of the particle.

The analog of this for [[spinning particle]]s and [[superparticle]]s are [[Killing-Yano tensor]]s.
