
A _configuration space_ is, naturally, a [[space]] of configurations of some system. The term appears as a technical term both in [[mathematics]] and in [[physics]]. While the idea is essentially the same in both cases, the emphasis of examples and perspectives differs. Notably in mathematics "the configration space of a [[topological space]] $X$" is usually taken by default to refer very specifically to the space of pairwise distinct points $X$, also called _[[Fadell's configuration space]]_.

Therefore see either of:

* [[configuration space (mathematics)]]

* [[configuration space (physics)]]
