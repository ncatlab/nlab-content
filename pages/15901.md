## Idea

[[set theory]] in the spirit of [[constructive mathematics]]

There are two main axiom systems:

* The impredicative IZF which includes the [[power set]] or [[power object]] axiom.
* The variant CZF for [[predicative mathematics]] . This system can be interpreted in predicative [[type theory]].

[[Algebraic set theory]] is a categorical presentation of such set theories.

Some more information can be found at [[ZFC]]. Perhaps this should be moved here.
