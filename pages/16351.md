## Statement

+-- {: .num_theorem #Embedding}
###### Theorem

The [[functor]]

$$
  C^\infty(-) \colon SmoothMfd \longrightarrow Alg_{\mathbb{R}}^{op}
$$

which sends a [[smooth manifold]] ([[finite number|finite]] [[dimension|dimensional]], [[paracompact topological space|paracompact]], [[second countable topological space|second countable]]) to (the [[formal dual]] of) its $\mathbb{R}$-[[associative algebra|algebra]] of [[smooth functions]] is a [[full and faithful functor]].


In other words, for two [[smooth manifolds]] $X,Y$ there is a [[natural bijection]] between the [[smooth functions]] $X \to Y$ and the algebra homomorphisms $C^\infty(X)\leftarrow C^\infty(Y)$.

###### Remark

The statement of theorem \ref{Embedding} serves as the stepping-stone for generalizations of [[differential geometry]] such as to [[supergeometry]]. On the other hand, for transporting various applications familiar from [[algebraic geometry]] to [[differential geometry]] (such as [[Kähler differentials]], see there) the above embedding is insufficient, and instead of just remembering the [[associative algebra]] structure, one needs to remember the _[[smooth algebra]]_-structure on algebras of smooth functions. See also at _[[synthetic differential geometry]]_.

###### Remark

If one drops standard regularity assumptions on manifolds then theorem \ref{Embedding} may break. For instance allowing [[countable set|uncountably]] many connected comoponents, then there are counterexamples ([MO discussion](http://mathoverflow.net/a/91445)).
