A __Frobenius category__ is a [[Quillen exact category]] which has enough [[injective object|injectives]] and enough [[projective object|projectives]] and where the class of projectives coincides with the class of injectives. A [[stable category]] of a Frobenius category is canonically a [[triangulated category]].
