## Idea

What are called _Fierz identities_ in [[physics]] are the relations that re-express [[bilinear map|bilinears]] in [[spinors]] in terms of elements of the corresponding [[Clifford algebra]]. The [[coefficients]] of this Fierz decomposition are hence effectively the [[Clebsch-Gordan coefficients]] for [[spin representations]].

In practice the Fierz identities are mostly relevant for checking whether certain spinor trilinear or quadrilinear expressions vanish identically.

## Definition

Given an [[irreducible representation|irreducible]] [[complex numbers|complex]] [[spinor representation]] $S$ of the [[spin group]] $Spin(V)$ and equipped with a [spinor metric](spin+representation#SpinorMetric), what are called _Fierz identities_ are the [[equations]] that express the composite [[isomorphism]]

$$
  S \otimes S \simeq S \otimes S^\ast \simeq End(S) \subset Cl(V)
$$

where 

1. $S \otimes S$  is the [[tensor product]] of the [[vector space]] $S$ with itself;

1. the first isomorphism is induced by the [spinor metric](spin+representation#SpinorMetric), which is equivalently an identification $S \simeq S^\ast$ of $S$ with its [[dual vector space]];

1.  the second isomorphism is the canonical one to the [[endomorphism ring]] of $S$ (using that [[FinVect]] is a [[compact closed category]] );

1. the last inclusion uses the fact that by the [classification of Clifford algebras](Clifford+algebra#Classification) on an [[irreducible representation|irreducible]] [[spinor representation]] the [[endomorphism ring]] is in fact included in the [[Clifford algebra]].

The traditional way to express this in terms of components is the following.

Given a [[spinor]] $\psi$, write $\overline{\psi} \coloneqq \psi^\dagger \Gamma_0$ for its Dirac conjugate ([def.](Majorana+spinor#DiracConjugate)).

Let $\{\Gamma^a\}$ be a [[basis]] for Dirac representation of the [[Clifford algebra]] ([prop.](Majorana+spinor#CliffordAlgebraRepresentation)) and write, as usual, $\{\Gamma^{a_1 \cdots a_p}\}$ for the skew-symmetrized [[matrix product]] of $p$ such basis elements. Then under the above [[isomorphism]] there will be for all pairs $\psi_1, \psi_2 \in S$ of [[spinors]] an [[equation]] of the form

$$
  \psi_1 \otimes \overline{\psi}_2
  =
  \sum_p c_p   \left(\overline{\psi_2}\Gamma^{a_1 \cdots a_p} \psi_1\right)
  \,
  \Gamma_{a_1 \cdots a_p}
  \,,
$$

where $c_p \in \mathbb{R}$ is some [[coefficient]], expressing the [[endomorphism]] of pairing with $\psi_2$ and then spitting out $\psi_1$ as a [[linear combination]] of the [[endomorphisms]] $\Gamma^{a_1 \cdots a_p}$.

This equation is, once the [[coefficients]] $c_p$ have been determined, the _Fierz identity_. The coefficients $c_p$ are effectively given by spinorial [[Clebsch-Gordan coefficients]], see [below](#AsSpinorialClebschGordanCoefficients) for more on this.

Often this is expressed after acting with the endomorphisms on a third chosen [[spinor]] $\psi_3$, in which case the Fierz identity reads

$$
  \left(\overline{\psi}_2 \psi_3\right) \psi_1  
  =
  \sum_p c_p   \left(\overline{\psi_2}\Gamma^{a_1 \cdots a_p} \psi_1\right)
  \,
  \Gamma_{a_1 \cdots a_p}\psi_3
  \,.
$$

## Applications

### Expression of spinor quadrilinears

The Fierz identities are typically used in order to re-express
quadrilinear terms of four [[spinors]] of the form

$$
  \left(
    \overline{\psi_1}\Gamma^{a_1 \cdots a_{p_1}} \psi_2
  \right)
  \left(
    \overline{\psi_3}\Gamma^{b_1 \cdots b_{p_2}} \psi_4
  \right) 
$$

by applying the identity to the pair $\psi_2 \otimes \overline{\psi_3}$ in the middle.

### For Chevalley-Eilenberg elements of supersymmetry algebras
 {#CEElementsInSupersymmetryAlgebra}

Let $S$ be a suitable real [[spinor representation]]
which induces a [[super Poincaré Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{siso}_S(d-1,1)$ with corresponding [[super translation Lie algebra]] ("[[super Minkowski spacetime]]") $\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1; S}$. See at _[[Majorana spinor]]_.

The corresponding [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] $CE(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1;S})$ is generated from the [[vielbein]] ("[[graviton]]") generators 

$$
  e^a \in CE^{(1,even)}(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1;S})
$$ 

and the "[[gravitino]]" generators 

$$
  \psi^\alpha \in CE^{(1,odd)}(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1;S})
$$

where the index ${}^a$ labels a chosen [[basis]] of $V$ and the index ${}^\alpha$ a chosen basis of $S$.

Now the Fierz identities are [[equations]] in the [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] of the form

$$
  \psi \wedge \overline{\psi}
  = 
  \sum_p c_p  
   \left(
     \overline{\psi}\wedge \Gamma^{a_1 \cdots a_p} \Gamma \psi
   \right)
   \,
   \Gamma_{a_1 \cdots a_p}
$$

or rather, with all indices shown

$$
  \psi^\alpha \wedge \overline{\psi}_\beta
  = 
  \sum_p c_p  
   \left(
     \overline{\psi}\wedge \Gamma^{a_1 \cdots a_p} \Gamma \psi
   \right)
   \,
   \Gamma_{a_1 \cdots a_p}{}^{\alpha}{}_\beta
  \;\;\;\;
  \in CE^{(2,even)}(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1;S})
  \,.
$$


### As spinorial Clebsch-Gordan coefficients
 {#AsSpinorialClebschGordanCoefficients}

On the left of the above equation we have a [[tensor product of representations|tensor product]] of [[spin representations]] which decomposes on the right into a [[direct sum]] of [[irreducible representations]]. This means that we are dealing with [[Clebsch-Gordan coefficients|Clebsch-Gordan decomposition]] of the tensor product representation into a [[direct sum]] of [[irreducible representations]].

(This perspective on the Fierz identities was maybe first amplified and put to used in ([D'Auria-Fré-Maina-Regge 82](#DAuriaFreMainaRegge82)), see also ([D'Auria-Fré 82a](#DAuriaFre82a), [D'Auria-Fré 82b](#DAuriaFre82b)). A textbook account is in [Castellani-D'Auria-Fré 91, chapter II.8](#CDF)) 

To project out the irreps one may contract with 
CE-elements parameterized in the form 

$$
  \Gamma_{a_1 \cdots a_{k}} \psi
  \in
  CE^{(1,odd)}(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1;S})
  \,.
$$

This gives the Fierz identities in the form

$$
  \psi \wedge 
   \left(\overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma_{a_1 \cdots a_p} \psi\right)
   = 
  \sum_p c_p  (\overline{\psi}\wedge \Gamma^{a_1 \cdots a_p} \Gamma)
   \wedge \Gamma_{a_1 \cdots a_p}\psi
  \,,
$$

which with indices shown is

$$
  \psi^\alpha \wedge 
   \left(\overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma_{a_1 \cdots a_p} \psi\right)
  = 
  \sum_p c_p  (\overline{\psi}\wedge \Gamma^{a_1 \cdots a_p} \Gamma)
   \wedge \left(\Gamma_{a_1 \cdots a_p}\psi\right)^\alpha
  \;\;\;
  \in CE^{(3,odd)}(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1;S})
  \,.
$$


### For computation of supersymmetric cohomology

A degree $(2,p)$-element of its [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] which is [[Lorentz group|Lorentz]] invariant is of the form

$$
  \mu \coloneqq \overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma^{a_1 \cdots a_p}\psi \wedge e_{a_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge e_{a_p}
  \,.
$$

The CE-[[differential]] sends this to

$$
  \begin{aligned}
  d_{CE}\mu 
  &= 
  d_{CE}
  \overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma^{a_1 \cdots a_p}\psi \wedge e_{a_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge e_{a_p}
   \\
   & \propto
  \left(\overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma^{a_1 \cdots a_p}\psi \wedge e_{a_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge e_{a_{p-1}}\right)
  \wedge
  \left(
    \overline{\psi}\wedge \Gamma_{a_p} \psi
  \right)   
  \,.
  \end{aligned}
$$

If the right hand side vanishes, then $\mu$ is a [[super Lie algebra|super]] [[Lie algebra cocycle]], and this is entirely controled by the Fierz identity applied the middle term $\psi \wedge \overline{\psi}$ and the symmetry properties of the [[Clifford algebra]] elements.

These computations control the existence of [[Green-Schwarz action functionals]] and hence [[schreiber:The brane bouquet]]. See there for more.
