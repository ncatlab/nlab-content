## Definition

In [[Type Two Theory of Effectivity]] for [[computable analysis]] (see [Weihrauch 00](#Weihrauch00)) one considers the following definition:

A _representation_ of a $T_0$-[[topological space]] $X$ is a presentation of it as a [[quotient space]] of a [[subspace]] $B$ of [[Baire space]] (the underlying space of [[Kleene's second algebra]]). Such a representation is called _admissible_ if the quotient map $B \to X$ it has the [[right lifting property]] again [[continuous functions]] out of other subspaces $B'$ of Baire space.

Given representations of $X$ and $X'$ in this way, then a [[function]] $f \colon X \to X'$ is called _contrinuously realizable_ if there exists a [[continuous function]] $\phi \colon B \to B'$ between the corresponding subspaces of Baire space such that the eviden [[commuting diagram|diagram commutes]].

For admissible representations a function $X\to X'$ is continuously realizable precisely if it is already continuous.

Write $AdmRep$ for the [[category]] of admissible representatins in this sense, and continuously realizable (and hence continuous) functions between these.

## Properties

### Relation to function realizability

The category $AdmRep$ above is a [[reflective subcategory]] of the [[function realizability topos]] $RT(\mathcal{K}_2)$ (see [vanOosten 08](#vanOosten08)).
