[[!redirects twisted Eilenberg -  Mac Lane space]]

##Idea

[[Eilenberg - Mac Lane space]]s represent the various classical cohomology theories, but for the classical form of [[twisted cohomology]] the coefficients are in a [[local system]], so one needs to 'twist' the representing object over a base corresponding to the classifying space of some groupoid.

This has sometimes been called a generalized Eilenberg-MacLane space, but is perhaps better termed a _twisted Eilenberg-MacLane space_ to avoid possible confusion.

The construction of these is to be found in the entry on [[twisted cohomology]].
