##  Idea 

The _RR field_ or _Ramond--Ramond field_ is a [[gauge theory|gauge field]] appearing in  [[supergravity|10-dimensional type II supergravity]].

Mathematically the RR field on a space $X$ is a [[cocycle]] in [[differential K-theory]] -- or rather, in full generality, in [[twisted differential K-theory|twisted differential]] [[KR-theory]] subject to a [[self-dual higher gauge field]] constrained encoded by a quadratic form defining an [[11-dimensional Chern-Simons theory]] on twisted differential KR cocycles.

Accordingly, the [[field strength]] of the RR field, i.e. the image of the [[differential cohomology|differential K-cocycle]] in deRham cohomology, is an inhomogeneous even or odd differential form


* in type IIB supergarvity
  $$
    F_{RR} = C_0 + C_2 + \cdots
  $$

* in type IIA supergarvity
  $$
    F_{RR} = C_1 + C_3 + \cdots
  $$

The components of this are sometimes called the RR forms. 

In the presence of a nontrivial [[Kalb–Ramond field]] the RR field is [[twisted cohomology|twisted]]: a cocycle in the corresponding [[twisted K-theory]].

Moreover, the RR field is constrained to be a self-dual differential K-cocycle in some sense.

The RR field derives its name from the way it shows up when the [[supergravity]] theory in question is derived as an effective background theory in [[string theory]]. From the [[sigma-model]] perspective of the string the RR field is the condensate of fermionic 0-mode excitations of the type II superstring for a particular choice of boundary conditons called the _Ramond_ boundary condititions. Since these boundary conditions have to be chosen for _two_ spinor components, the name appears twice.
