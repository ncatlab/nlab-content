###### Definition (transpose map)
The **dual linear map** or __transpose map__ of a [[linear map]] $A\colon V\to W$, is the linear map $A^* = A^T\colon W^*\to V^*$, given by
$$ \langle{A^*(w), v}\rangle = \langle{w, A(v)}\rangle $$
for all $w$ in $W^*$ and $v$ in $V$.

###### Remark

This functor is, of course, the [[representable functor]] represented by $K$ as a vector space over itself (a [[line]]).

###### Remark

This construction is the notion of [[dual morphism]] applied in the [[monoidal category]] [[Vect]] with its [[tensor product]] monoidal structure.
