## Idea

A _sesquiunital sesquiagebra_ is an [[algebra objects]] [[internalization|internal]] to the [[2-category]] [[2Mod]] of [[algebras]], [[bimodules]] and [[bimodule intertwiners]]. This means that it is an algebra equipped with an additional associative product and unit which are both exhibited by [[bimodules]]. If these bimodules come from algebra [[homomorphisms]] then the sesquialgebra is a [[bialgebra]].

The structure of a sesquialgebra is just so that the [[category of modules]] of the underlying algebra is itself a [[monoidal category]]. In this sense sesquialgebras are a placeholder for [[2-algebras]]. Moreover, in as far as these 2-algebras themselves are regarded as placeholders for _their_ [[2-category]] of [[2-modules]] a sesquialgebra presents a [[3-module]]/[[3-vector space]].

Sesquialgebras with an extra grouplike-property have been called _[[hopfish algebras]]_.

## Definition

###### Definition

A [[sesquiunital sesquialgebra]] over $R$ is an [[associative algebra]] $A$ over $R$ equipped with the structure of an [[algebra object]] internal to the [[2-category]] [[2Mod]] of [[associative algebras]], [[bimodules]] and [[bimodule intertwiners]].

This means that it is an $R$-algebra $A$ equipped with 

* a product $A \otimes_R A$-$A$-[[bimodule]] $\Delta$;

* a unit $R$-$A$-[[bimodule]] $\epsilon$

satisfying the evident [[associative law]] and [[unit law]].

## Properties

### Tannaka duality

Precomposition with the product and unit bimodule makes the [[category of modules]] over the underlying [[associative algebra]] of a sesquialgebra itself into a [[monoidal category]].

See for instance ([Vercruysse, 5.3.3](#Vercruysse)).
