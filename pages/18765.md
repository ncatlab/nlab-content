## Idea

Given a [[linear differential operator]] $P$, then a _generalized solution_ or _weak solution_ of the corresponding homogenous [[differential equation]] is a [[distribution]] $u$ (hence a "[[generalized function]]" via [this prop](non-singular+distribution#NonSingularDistributionsAreDenseInAllDistributions)) satisfying 

$$
  P u = 0
  \,,
$$

where the differential operator on the left now acts via [[derivatives of distributions]].

Similarly there are generalized solutions for the inhomogeneous equation, and in fact now the inhomogeneity may itself be a [[distribution]]. In particular for [[delta distribution]]-inhomogeneity

$$
  P u = \delta
$$

the generalized solutions $u$ are the _[[fundamental solutions]]_ or _[[Green's functions]]_ of $P$.
