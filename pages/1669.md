In [[propositional logic]], the __exclusive disjunction__ (also called __exclusive or__ or simply __xor__) of a family of statements ([[truth value]]s, propositions, predicates, velc) is a statement that is true if and only if exactly one of the statements in the family is true.  The corresponding on operation on [[subset]]s (of a fixed set) or [[pure set]]s is called __symmetric difference__.


## Definitions

The __exclusive disjunction__ of $p$ and $q$, written $p &#x22BB; q$ (and a host of other ways), may be defined in any of these forms:
1.  $\neg(p \Leftrightarrow q)$,
2.  $(p \vee q) \wedge \neg(p \wedge q)$,
3.  $(p \wedge \neg{q}) \vee (\neg{p} \wedge q)$.

These are all equivalent in [[classical logic]].  In [[intuitionistic logic]], (2,3) are equivalent but (1) is weaker; (2,3) give the usual meaning in [[constructive mathematics]].

The false statement is the [[identity element|identity]] for this operation; it is the exclusive disjunction of no statements.

In classical logic (but not in intuitionistic logic), this operation is associative, but multiple applications don\'t mean what you may think.  Instead, $(p &#x22BB; q) &#x22BB; \equiv p &#x22BB; (q &#x22BB; r)$ comes out true if $p, q, r$ are all true; in general,
$$ (p_1 &#x22BB; (p_2 &#x22BB; \cdots &#x22BB; p_n)\cdots) $$
is true if and only if an *odd* number of the statements $p_i$ is true.  But when we write a multiple statement with 'xor', we really mean that *exactly one* of the statements is true.  So by fiat, define the __exclusive disjunction__
$$ p_1 &#x22BB; p_2 &#x22BB; \cdots &#x22BB; p_n $$
(without parentheses) to mean that exactly one of the $p_i$ is true.

As the indexed version of ordinary [[disjunction]] is [[existential quantification]] $\exists$, so the indexed version of exclusive disjunction is [[uniqueness quantification]] $\exists!$; this requires a primitive notion of [[equality]] to state in [[predicate logic]].

Similarly, the __symmetric difference__ of two sets $A$ and $B$, written $A \uplus B$ (and a host of other ways), may be defined using exclusive disjunction:
$$ A \uplus B = \{ x \;|\; x \in A \;&#x22BB;\; x \in B \} .$$
The __symmetric difference__ of a family $(A_i)_{i: I}$ of sets may be defined using uniqueness quantification:
$$ \biguplus_i A_i = \{ x \;|\; \exists!{x},\; x \in A_i \} .$$


## In natural language

It is widely said that 'or' in English can mean either inclusive or exclusive disjunction, while Latin has two terms, respectively 'vel' and 'aut'.  It\'s not at all clear that this is correct.  It may be more correct that 'or' can sometimes mean [[union]] and sometimes [[disjoint union]] (with the latter sometimes external and sometimes internal), but never symmetric difference.  Thus, the only meaning of 'or' is for some kind of [[coproduct]], which exclusive disjunction is not.  (Similarly, 'aut' may be more about disjoint union than symmetric difference.)

I should find the reference that argued this; it certainly did not use this terminology.
