## Idea

The notion of _orthogonal spectrum_ is a variant of that of spectrum. An orthogonal spectrum is a sequence of [[pointed topological spaces]] $\{X_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ equipped with maps $X_n \wedge S^1 \longrightarrow X_{n+1}$ from the [[suspension]] of one into the next, but such that the $n$th [[topological space]] is equipped with an [[action]] of the [[orthogonal group]] $O(n)$ and such that all the induced structure maps 

$$
  X_n \wedge S^k \longrightarrow X_{n+k}
$$

are all $O(n)\times O(k)$-[[equivariance|equivariant]], hence are [[action]] [[homomorphisms]].

## Properties

### Relation to global equivariant stable homotopy theory

Since orthogonal spectra are by definition equipped with orthogonal group [[actions]], they serve as models for [[equivariant homotopy theory]] "for all groups at once", called _[[global stable homotopy theory]]_.
