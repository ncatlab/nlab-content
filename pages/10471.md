## Idea

The [[category]] of _orthogonal spectra_  is a [[presentable (∞,1)-category|presentation]] of the [[symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category]] of spectra, with the special property that it implements the [[smash product of spectra]] such as to yield itself a [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]] [[monoidal model category|monoidal]] [[model category of spectra]]: the _[[model structure on symmetric spectra]]_. This implies in particular that with respect to this [[symmetric smash product of spectra]] an [[E-∞ ring]] is presented simply as a plain [[commutative monoid]] [[internalization|in]] orthogonal spectra.

Other presentations sharing this property are _[[symmetric spectra]]_ and _[[S-modules]]_.

Orthogonal spectra also support a similarly good model for [[equivariant stable homotopy theory]] (while [[symmetric spectra]] share this property only for equivaruance under [[finite groups]].)

An orthogonal spectrum is a sequence of [[pointed topological spaces]] $\{X_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ equipped with maps $X_n \wedge S^1 \longrightarrow X_{n+1}$ from the [[suspension]] of one into the next, but such that the $n$th [[topological space]] is equipped with an [[action]] of the [[orthogonal group]] $O(n)$ and such that all the induced structure maps 

$$
  X_n \wedge S^k \longrightarrow X_{n+k}
$$

are all $O(n)\times O(k)$-[[equivariance|equivariant]], hence are [[action]] [[homomorphisms]]. There is a natural [[homotopy theory]] of such orthogonal spectra and it is equivalent to the standard [[stable homotopy theory]] ([MMSS 98](#MMSS08)).

## Definition

## Properties

### Homotopy theory

([MMSS 98b](#MMSS98b))

### Relation to the J-homomorphism

see ([Schwede, example 4.22](#Schwede))


### Relation to the cobordism hypothesis

> check

A [[connective spectrum]] is equivalently a grouplike [[E-∞ space]], hence a [[Picard ∞-groupoid]]. As such it is an [[(∞,0)-category]] of [[fully dualizable objects]]. By the [[cobordism hypothesis]] this means that it is equipped with an $O(n)$-[[∞-action]] for all $n$, coming from the action $O(n)$ on the [[framed manifold|n-framings]] of the point in the [[(∞,n)-category of cobordisms]]. This $O(n)$-action is that which is encoded by the definition of orthogonal spectrum ([Lurie 09, example 2.4.15](#Lurie09)).




### Relation to global equivariant stable homotopy theory

Since orthogonal spectra are by definition equipped with orthogonal group [[actions]], they serve as models for [[equivariant homotopy theory]] "for all groups at once", called _[[global stable homotopy theory]]_.
