## Idea

A [[differential form]] $\omega \in \Omega^p(X)$ is called _closed_ if the [[de Rham differential]] $d \colon \Omega^{p}(X) \to \Omega^{p+1}(X)$ sends it to zero: $d \omega = 0$, hence if it is in the [[kernel]] of the de Rham.

A differential form $\omega \in \Omega^{p+1}(X)$ is called _exact_ if it is in the [[image]] of the de Rham differential: $\omega = d \alpha$, for some $\alpha \in \Omega^{p}(X)$.

The [[quotient]] of the vector space of closed differential forms by the exact differential forms of degree $p$ is the _[[de Rham cohomology]]_ of $X$ in degree $p$.

Formalization of closed and co-exact differential forms in [[cohesive homotopy theory]] is discussed at _[[differential cohomology hexagon]]_.
