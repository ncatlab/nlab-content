## Idea

In **string topology** one studies the [[BV-algebra]]-structure on the [[singular homology]] of the [[free loop space]] $X^{S^1}$ of an [[oriented]] [[manifold]] $X$, or more generally the [[framed little 2-disk operad|framed little 2-disk algebra]]-structure on the singular [[chain complex]]. This is a special case of the general algebraic structure on higher order [[Hochschild cohomology]], as discussed there. 

The study of _string topology_ was initated by [[Moira Chas]] and [[Dennis Sullivan]]. 


## In terms of TQFTs

The structures studied in the _string topology_ of a [[smooth manifold]] $X$ may be understood as being essentially the data of a 2-dimensional [[topological field theory]] [[sigma model]] with [[target space]] $X$, or rather its linearization to a [[TCFT]] (with due care on some technical subtleties). 

The idea is that the [[configuration space]] of a closed or open [[string]]-[[sigma-model]] propagating on $X$ is the [[loop space]] or path space of $X$, respectively. The space of [[state]]s of the string is some space of sections over this configuration space, to which the (co)homology $H_\bullet(L X)$ is an approximation. The string topology operations are then the [[cobordism]]-representation

$$
  H_\bullet(Bord_2) \to Ch_\bullet
$$

given by the [[FQFT]] corresponding to the $\sigma$-modelon these state spaces, acting on these state spaces.

The topological construction goes back to ([Godin](#Godin)). A conjecture for how string topology yields a [[TCFT]] is in ([Costello](#Costello)), which is made more precise at the end of ([Lurie](#Lurie)). More details on all this are in ([Kuipers](#Kuipers)).
