## Idea

Given a [[differential form]] $\omega$ of degree $n$ on some [[smooth space]] $X$ and given a [[closed manifold|closed]] [[smooth manifold]] $\Sigma$ of [[dimension]] $k \leq n$, then there is canonically induced a differential form $\tau_\Sigma \omega$ of degree $n-k$ on the [[mapping space]] $[\Sigma,X]$: its restriction to any smooth family $\Phi_{(-)}$ of smooth functions $\Phi_u \colon \Sigma \to X$ is the result of first forming the [[pullback of differential forms]] of $\omega$ along $\Phi_{(-)}$ and then forming the [[integration of differential forms]] of the result over $\Sigma$:

$$
  \tau_{\Sigma} \omega\vert_{\Phi}
    \coloneqq
  \int_\Sigma \Phi_{(-)}^\ast \omega
  \,.
$$

This differential form $\tau_\Sigma \omega$ on the mapping space is called the _[[transgression]]_ of $\omega$ with respect to $\Sigma$

This construction has a variety of immediate generalizations, for instance $\Sigma$ may have [[manifold with boundary|boundary]] and [[manifold with corners|corners]] and the [[mapping space]] may be generalized to a [[space of sections]] of a given [[fiber bundle]]. Of course it also generalizes to coefficients richer than differential forms, such as [[cocycles]] in [[differential cohomology]].

Important examples of transgression of differential forms appear in [[Lagrangian field theory]] (in the sense of [[physics]]) defined by a [[Lagrangian density|Lagrangian form]] on the [[jet bundle]] of a [[field bundle]]. Here the transgression of the Lagrangian itself is the corresponding _[[action functional]]_, the transgression of its [[Euler-Lagrange operator|Euler-Lagrange variational derivative]] is the 1-form whose vanishing is the _[[equations of motion]]_ and the transgression of the induced [[pre-symplectic current]] is the _[[pre-symplectic form]] on the [[covariant phase space]]_ of the field theory. 


## Definition

Since the concept of transgression of differential forms involves [[mapping spaces]] between, in particular, [[smooth manifolds]], it is most conveniently formulated in terms of the concept of [[generalized smooth spaces]] called _[[smooth sets]]_. For the following discussion we assume background on [[smooth sets]] as introduced in 

* _[[geometry of physics -- smooth sets]]_

* _[[geometry of physics -- differential forms]]_

Recall form the discussion there that a [[smooth set]] $X$ is _defined_ by specifying, in a consistent way, what counts as a smooth functions $U \to X$  from a [[Cartesian space]] $U$ (a "plot" of $X$). Given two smooth sets $X$ and $Y$ then a [[smooth function]] $f \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Y$ is a function that takes plots $U \overset{\phi}{\to} X$ of $X$ to plots $f \circ \phi \colon U \to Y$ of $Y$. 

A key example of a smooth set which is in general not a [[smooth manifold]] is the [[mapping space]] $[X,Y]$ between two smooth sets $X$ and $Y$, hence the set of all smooth functions $X \to Y$ equipped with a smooth structure itself. Namely a plot $\phi_{(-)} \colon U \to [X,Y]$ is defined to be a smooth function $\phi_{(-)}(-) \colon U \times X \to Y$ out of the [[Cartesian product]] of $U$ with $X$ to $Y$,  hence a "U-parameterized smooth family of smooth functions".

An example of a smooth set which is far from being a smooth manifold is for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the smooth set $\mathbf{\Omega}^n$ which is the "smooth [[classifying space]]" for [[differential n-forms]], defined by the rule that a smooth function $\phi \colon U \to \mathbf{\Omega}^n$ is equivalently a smooth differential $n$-form on $U$ (to be thought of as the [[]pullback of differential forms|pullback]) of a "universal $n$-form" on $\mathbf{\Omega}^n$ along $\phi$.
It follows from this in particular that for $X$ any [[smooth manifold]] then smooth functions $X \to \mathbf{\Omega}^n$ are equivalent to smooth $n$-forms on $X$. Accordingly we may say that for $X$ any [[smooth sez]] (which may be far from being a smooth manifold) then a differential $n$-form on $X$ is equivalently a smooth function $X \to \mathbf{\Omega}^n$.

These examples may be combined: the [[mapping space]] $[\Sigma, \mathbf{\Omega}^n]$ is a kind of smooth classifying space for differential forms _on_ $\Sigma$: a smooth function $\omega_{(-)} \colon U \to [\Sigma,\mathbf{\Omega}^n]$ into this space is, by the above, a [[differential n-form]] on the [[Cartesian product]] $U \times \Sigma$.

(There is a smooth space that has more right to be called "the" classifying space of differential $n$-foms on $\Sigma$, namely the [[concretification]] $\sharp_1 [\Sigma, \mathbf{\Omega}^n]$, but for the discussion of trangression actually the unconcretified space is the right one to use.)

###### Definition
**(parameterized [[integration of differential forms]])

Let 

1. $X$ be a [[smooth set]];

1. $n \geq k \in \mathbb{N}$;

1. $\Sigma_k$ be a [[compact topological space|compact]] [[smooth manifold]] of [[dimension]] $k$.

Then we write

$$
  \int_{\Sigma}
    \;\colon\;
  [\Sigma_k, \mathbf{\Omega}^n]
    \longrightarrow
  \mathbf{\Omega}^{n-k}
$$

for the [[smooth function]] which takes a plot $\omega_{(-)} \colon U \to [\Sigma, \mathbf{\Omega}^k]$, hence equivalently a differential $n$-form $\omega_{(-)}(-)$ on $U \times \Sigma$ to the result of [[integration of differential forms]] over $\Sigma$:


$$
  \int_{\Sigma} \omega_{(-)}(-) \coloneqq \int_\Sigma \omega_{(-)}
  \,.

###### Definition
**(transgression of differential forms to [[mapping spaces]])

Let

1. $n \geq k \in \mathbb{N}$;

1. $\Sigma_k$ be a [[compact topological space|compact]] [[smooth manifold]] of [[dimension]] $k$.

Then the operation of _transgression of differential $n$-forms_ on $X$ with respect to $\Sigma$ is the [[function]]

from differential $n$-forms on $X$ to differential $n-k$-forms on the [[mapping space]] $[\Sigma,X]$ which takes the differential form corresponding to the smooth function

$$
