## Idea

A _cubical structure_ on a [[complex line bundle]] over an [[abelian group]] is a certain trivialization of a certain induced line bundle on the 3-fold Cartesian product ("cube") of the group which is constructed in a kind of cubical generalization of the [[polarization identity]] formula for [[quadratic forms]].

Over [[formal groups]] associated with [[complex oriented cohomology theories]] cubical structures encode [[orientation in generalized cohomology]].


## Definition

Given a [[circle group]]-[[principal bundle]]/[[complex line bundle]] $\mathcal{L}$ on an [[abelian group]] $A$, write $\Theta(\mathcal{L})$ for the line bundle on $G^3$ which is given by the formula

$$
  \Theta(\mathcal{L})_{x,y,z}
  =
  \mathcal{L}_{x+y+z} \otimes \mathcal{L}_{x+y}^{-1} \otimes \mathcal{L}_{x+z}^{-1} \otimes \mathcal{L}_{y+z}^{-1} \otimes \mathcal{L}_x \otimes \mathcal{L}_y \otimes \mathcal{L}_z
  \,.
$$

A _cubical structure_ on $\mathcal{L}$ is a trivializing [[section]] $s$ of $\Theta(\mathcal{L})$ such that

1. $s(0,0,0) \simeq 1$

1. $s(x_{\sigma(1)}, x_{\sigma(2)}, x_{\sigma(3)}) \simeq s(x_1, x_2, x_3)$

1. $s(w+x,y,z) s(w,x,z) \simeq s(w,x + y, z) s(x,y,z)$

for all elements of $A$ as indicated, and for all [[permutations]] $\sigma$ of three elements.

## Properties

### Relation to orientations in complex-oriented cohomology theory

For $E$ a [[multiplicative cohomology theory|multiplicative]] [[weakly periodic cohomology theory|weakly periodic]] [[complex orientable cohomology theory]] then $Spec E^0(B U\langle 6\rangle)$ is naturally equivalent to the space of cubical structures on the trivial line bundle over the [[formal group]] of $E$.

In particular, [[homotopy classes]] of maps of [[E-infinity ring]] spectra $MU\langle 6\rangle \to E$ from the [[Thom spectrum]] to $E$, and hence universal $MU\langle 6\rangle$-[[orientation in generalized cohomology|orientations]] (see there) of $E$ are in natural bijection with these cubical structures.

([Ando-Hopkins-Strickland 01](#AndoHopkinsStrickland01) [Hopkins 02, theorem 6.1, 6.2](#Hopkins02))

This way for instance the [[string orientation of tmf]] has been constructed. See there for more on this.
