A __boolean domain__ $\mathbb{B}$ is a generic 2-element set, say, $\mathbb{B} = \{ 0, 1 \}$, whose elements are intended for interpretation as logical values, commonly but not invariably, with $0 = \mathrm{false}$ and $1 = \mathrm{true}$.  In particular, the set of [[truth values]] in [[classical logic]], $\{ \bot, \top \}$, is a Boolean domain.

If we think of $\mathbb{B}$ as a [[pointed set]] equipped with the element that is interpreted as $true$ (so that the other element must be interpreted as $false$), then there is an [[generalized the|effectively unique]] boolean domain.

This is the right sort of box, although usually you should sign what you write (unless it\'s fairly impersonal).  ---Toby

The way I'll be doing things, there is actually an important distinction between the mathematical object $\mathbb{B} = \{ 0, 1 \}$ and the set of logical values $\{ \mathrm{false}, \mathrm{true} \}$.  There is a step of interpretation --- or "applying the mathematics to the logical subject matter" --- that separates them.  There is of course the usual interpretation, so we often get sloppy about when we cross the line, but there are good reasons for observing it at other times.   ---Jon

Well, maybe you should just go ahead and write what you intend to write here; everything here is a work in progress and your text can clash with mine for a bit until we work it out.  But on the nLab, we\'re very much into a structural approach to mathematics, and we\'ll want to say when one thing can be interpreted as another, and when two things are equivalent, and if so in what ways.   ---Toby

A __boolean variable__ $x$ is a variable that takes its value from a boolean domain, as $x \in \mathbb{B}$.  If this variable depends on parameters, then it is (or defines) a [[Boolean-valued function]], that is a [[function]] whose target if $\mathbb{B}$.
