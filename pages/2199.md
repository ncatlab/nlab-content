A __boolean domain__ $\mathbb{B}$ is a generic 2-element set, say, $\mathbb{B} = \{ 0, 1 \}$, whose elements are intended for interpretation as logical values, commonly but not invariably, with $0 = \mathrm{false}$ and $1 = \mathrm{true}$.

A __boolean variable__ $x$ is a variable that takes its value from a boolean domain, as $x \in \mathbb{B}$.
