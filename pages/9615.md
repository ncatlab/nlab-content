### Linear codes 

A ($q$-ary) **linear code** of length $n$ and rank $k$ is a $k$-dimensional subspace of the $n$-dimensional vector space $\mathbb{F}_q^n$ over a [[finite set|finite]] [[field]] $\mathbb{F}_q$ with $q$ elements, or of any $n$-dimensional space over $\mathbb{F}_q$ that comes equipped with a "standard" basis. A principal application is in the construction of [[error-correcting code]]s. 

There is a [[species|Joyal species]] $Code_{q, k}: Core(FinSet) \to Set$ of $q$-ary linear codes of rank $k$, which assigns to a finite set $\Omega$ the set of $k$-dimensional subspaces of the free $\mathbb{F}_q$-vector space generated by $\Omega$ as basis. The corresponding [[groupoid]] of $q$-linear codes is the [[category of elements]] of $Code_{q, k}$. This gives one notion of [[isomorphism]] of linear codes, where an isomorphism $(S, V \subseteq \mathbb{F}_q S) \to (T, W \subseteq \mathbb{F}_q T)$ is a bijection $\phi: S \to T$ such that the linear map $\mathbb{F}_q \phi$ carries $V$ onto $W$. Thus, isomorphisms in this sense are given by permutation matrices. 

An alternative notion that recurs in coding theory is that an isomorphism (often called an _equivalence_) of codes consists of a [[monomial matrix]] which, when interpreted as a linear isomorphism using the assigned linear bases, carries $V$ onto $W$.  

Each assigned basis $\{e_1, \ldots, e_n\}$ of a vector space $U$ can be construed as a self-dual basis with respect to a bilinear form, so that $\langle e_i, e_j \rangle = \delta_{i j}$. In terms of coordinates with respect to the chosen basis, this bilinear form is the usual dot product 

$$(\vec{x}, \vec{y}) \mapsto x_1 y_1 + \ldots + x_n y_n$$ 

and this bilinear form is used to define the notion of _dual code_ (see below). 

### Binary linear codes 

The following is largely adapted from [Frankel, Lepowsky, Meurman](#FLM). 

A **(binary linear) code** is a $q$-ary code with $q = 2$. In this case, isomorphisms defined by permutation matrices are the same as isomorphisms defined by monomial matrices. 

As a combinatorial structure on a finite set $\Omega$, a binary linear code is typically construed as a subspace of a finite power set $P(\Omega)$, considered as an $\mathbb{F}_2$-space whose addition is given by taking the symmetric difference of sets, and with standard basis given by the [[atoms]]. 

In that case, the standard dot product can be identified with the nondegenerate symmetric $\mathbb{F}_2$-bilinear pairing on the Boolean ring $P(\Omega)$ given by 

$$ P(\Omega) \times P(\Omega) \stackrel{\langle -, - \rangle}{\to} \mathbb{F}_2$$ 

$$\,$$

$$(S, T) \mapsto {|S \cap T|} \pmod 2$$ 

where ${|C|}$ is the [[cardinality]] of a set $C$. In the sequel, we let $n = {|\Omega|} = \dim(P(\Omega))$. 

To each code $\mathbf{C} \subset P(\Omega)$ there is a **dual code** $\mathbf{C}^\perp$: 

$$\mathbf{C}^\perp = \{S \in P(\Omega): \forall T \in \mathbf{C} \; \langle S, T \rangle = 0\}.$$ 

Notice that $\dim(\mathbf{C}^\perp) = n - \dim(\mathbf{C})$. A code $\mathbf{C}$ is **self-dual** if $\mathbf{C} = \mathbf{C}^\perp$. In this case $n$ is even and $\dim(\mathbf{C}) = n/2$. 

Now suppose $\Omega$ is a set with an even number $n$ of elements. The collection $E(\Omega)$ of subsets of even cardinality is a vector subspace of $P(\Omega)$ of dimension $n-1$, and we have 

$$E(\Omega) = 1^\perp,$$ 

where $1$ is the multiplicative unit of $P(\Omega)$ (the subset $\Omega$), under the assumption $n$ is even. On $E(\Omega)$ we may define a quadratic form 

$$q: E(\Omega) \to \mathbb{F}_2$$ 

taking $S \in E(\Omega)$ to $\frac{{|S|}}{2} \pmod 2$; this $q$ gives rise to the bilinear form $\langle -, - \rangle$ on $E(\Omega)$ via 

$$\langle S, T \rangle = q(S + T) - q(S) - q(T).$$ 

A code $\mathbf{C} \subset P(\Omega)$ is of **type II** if 

* $4$ divides ${|C|}$ for every $C \in \mathbf{C}$ and $\Omega \in \mathbf{C}$, 

and of **type I** if 

* $\mathbf{C} \subset E(\Omega)$ and $\Omega \in \mathbf{C}$, but $\mathbf{C}$ is not of type II. 

Notice that the quadratic form (hence the bilinear form) vanishes on a type II code $\mathbf{C}$, so that we have $\mathbf{C} \subset \mathbf{C}^\perp$ (i.e., $\mathbf{C}$ is isotropic). If $\mathbf{C}$ is maximal isotropic -- has half the dimension of $P(\Omega)$ -- then it follows that $\mathbf{C}$ is self-dual.

###### Example 
**(Hamming $(8, 4)$ code)** 
Up to isomorphism, there is a unique type II self-dual code $\mathbf{C} \subset P(\Omega)$ where $\Omega$ is an 8-element set. Such a code may be constructed as follows: let $\Omega$ be the projective line $\mathbb{P}^1 \mathbb{F}_7$, so as a set $\Omega = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, \infty\}$. Let $Q$ be the set of squares $0, 1, 2, 4$ and let $N$ be its complement in $\Omega$. The span of the set of elements $\{N + i: i \in \mathbb{F}_7\}$ (where $\infty + i = \infty$ for each $i$) is a 4-dimensional space consisting of 16 elements: 

$$\array{
\emptyset, & \{3, 5, 6, \infty\}, & \{0, 4, 6, \infty\}, & \{0, 1, 5, \infty\} \\  
\{1, 2, 6, \infty\}, & \{0, 2, 3, \infty\}, & \{1, 3, 4, \infty\}, & \{2, 4, 5, \infty\} \\ 
\{0, 3, 4, 5\}, & \{1, 4, 5, 6\}, & \{0, 2, 5, 6\}, & \{0, 1, 3, 6\} \\  
\{0, 1, 2, 4\}, & \{1, 2, 3, 5\}, & \{2, 3, 4, 6\}, & \Omega.
}$$ 

For this subspace $\mathbf{C} \subset P(\Omega)$, every element is a set that is of cardinality $0$, $4$, or $8$. It is clearly of type II, and self-dual because it is maximal isotropic. 

There is a second Hamming code $\mathbf{C}'$ (isomorphic to $\mathbf{C}$) that is spanned by the elements $\{-N - i: i \in \mathbb{F}_7\}$. This is "complementary" to the first in an appropriate sense: we have 

$$\mathbf{C} + \mathbf{C}' = E(\Omega), \qquad \mathbf{C} \cap \mathbf{C}' = \mathbb{F}_2 \Omega,$$ 

so that $\mathbf{C}/\mathbb{F}_2 \Omega$ is complementary to $\mathbf{C}'/\mathbb{F}_2 \Omega$ in the 6-dimensional space $E(\Omega)/\mathbb{F}_2 \Omega$.

In the theory of error-correcting codes, this is related to the Hamming $(7, 4)$ code, but with an extra parity bit. The Hamming $(7, 4)$ code is one of an infinite family of Hamming codes of type $(2^r - 1, 2^r - r - 1)$.

###### Example 
(The [[binary Golay code]].) Up to isomorphism, there is a unique self-dual code of type II on a 24-element set with no elements of weight (= cardinality) 4. Indeed, let $3 \Omega$ denote the disjoint union of three copies of $\Omega$. Construct a code $\mathbf{D} \subset P(3\Omega)$ that is spanned by elements of the form 

$$S \sqcup S \sqcup \emptyset, \qquad S \sqcup \emptyset \sqcup S, \qquad T \sqcup T \sqcup T$$ 

where $S$ ranges over elements of the Hamming code $\mathbf{C}$ and $T$ ranges over elements of the Hamming code $\mathbf{C}'$. Any three elements $S \sqcup S \sqcup \emptyset$, $S' \sqcup \emptyset \sqcup S'$, and $T \sqcup T \sqcup T$ are mutually orthogonal in $P(\Omega)$, so evidently $\mathbf{D}$ is an orthogonal direct sum of three 4-dimensional isotropic spaces, making $\mathbf{D}$ an isotropic subspace of dimension 12, hence maximal isotropic. Each element of $\mathbf{D}$ has cardinality a multiple of $4$, making it self-dual type II. 

To see that $\mathbf{D}$ has no elements of weight 4, argue as follows. Note that combinations $(S \sqcup S \sqcup \emptyset) + (S' \sqcup \emptyset \sqcup S')$ are of the form $S_1 \sqcup S_2 \sqcup S_3$ such that $S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0$. Now suppose we had 

$${|S_1 + T|} + {|S_2 + T|} + {|S_3 + T|} = 4.$$ 

Since all the summands are even, one must be zero, so say $S_3 + T = 0$. Since $\mathbf{C} \cap \mathbf{C}' = \mathbb{F}_2 \Omega$, we must have $T \in \mathbb{F}_2 \Omega$. But then ${|S_1 + T|}$ and ${|S_2 + T|}$ are multiples of $4$, and therefore one is zero, so say $S_2 + T = 0$. But now we have 

$$S_1 = S_1 - 2 T = S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0$$ 

whence we infer that ${|S_1 + T|}$ is a multiple of $8$, and we have reached a contradiction.
