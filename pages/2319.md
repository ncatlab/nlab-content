## Idea

A _spin structure_ on a [[manifold]] $X$ with an [[orientation]] is a lift $\hat g$ of the classifying map $g : X \to B S O(n)$ of the [[tangent bundle]] through the second step $B Spin(n) \to B S O(n)$ in the [[Whitehead tower]] of $O(n)$.

$$
  \array{
    && B Spin(n)
    \\
    & {}^{\hat g}\nearrow & \downarrow
    \\
    X &\stackrel{g}{\to}&
    B S O(n)
  }
$$

Spin structures derive their name from the fact that their existence on a space $X$ make the [[quantum anomaly]] for spinning particles propagating on $X$ vanish. See there.

## Definition

For $X$ a [[manifold]], the [[groupoid]]/[[homotopy n-type|homotopy 1-type]] $Spin(X)$ of **spin structures** over $X$ is the [[homotopy fiber]] in [[∞Grpd]] $\simeq$ [[Top]]  of the second [[Stiefel-Whitney class]]

$$
  \array{
    Spin(X) &\to& *
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\eta}}\downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    Top(X,B SO) &\stackrel{(w_2)_*}{\to}& Top(X, B^2 \mathbb{Z}_2)
  }
  \,.
$$

Here an [[object]] $s \in Spin(X)$ over an $SO$-[[principal bundle]] $\eta(s)$ on $X$ is called a **spin structure on $\eta(s)$** ($SO$ is the [[special orthogonal group]]).

For $\eta(s)$ the $SO$-principal bundle for which the [[tangent bundle]] $T X$ is the canonically [[associated bundle]], one says that a spin-structure on $\eta(s)$ is a **spin structure on the manifold** $X$.


## Properties

### Over a Riemann surface
 {#OverARiemannSurface}

Over a [[Riemann surface]] spin structures correspond to [[square roots]] of the [[canonical bundle]]. See at _[[Theta characteristic]]_.

### Over a Hermitian manifold / Kähler manifold

###### Proposition

A spin structure on a [[compact topological space|compact]] [[Hermitian manifold]] ([[Kähler manifold]]) $X$ of complex [[dimension]] $n$ exists precisely if, equivalently

* there is a choice of [[square root]] $\sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}}$ of the [[canonical line bundle]] $\Omega^{n,0}$ (a "[[Theta characteristic]]"); 

* there is a trivialization of the [[first Chern class]] $c_1(T X)$ of the [[tangent bundle]].

In this case one has:

###### Proposition

There is a [[natural isomorphism]] 

$$
  S_X \simeq \Omega^{0,\bullet}_X \otimes \sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}}_X
$$ 

of the [[sheaf]] of [[sections]] of the [[spinor bundle]] $S_X$ on $X$ with the [[tensor product]] of the  [[Dolbeault complex]] with the corresponding [[Theta characteristic]];


Moreover, the corresponding [[Dirac operator]] is the [[Dolbeault-Dirac operator]] $\overline{\partial} + \overline{\partial}^\ast$.

### As quantum anomaly cancellation condition  {#QuantumAnomaly}

In the context of [[quantum field theory]] the existence of a spin structure on a [[Riemannian manifold]] $X$ arises notably as the condition for [[quantum anomaly]] cancellation of the [[sigma-model]] for the spinning particle -- the superparticle -- propagating on $X$. 

It is the generalization of this anomaly computation from the worldlines of superparticles to super[[string theory|string]]s that leads to [[string structure]], and then further the generalizaton to the worldvolume anomaly of fivebranes that leads to [[fivebrane structure]].

## Examples

### On the 2-sphere
 {#OnThe2Sphere}

The 2-[[sphere]] $S^2$ is famously a [[complex manifold]]: the [[Riemann sphere]]. One standard way to exhibit the complex structure is to cover $S^2$ with two copies of the [[complex plane]] with [[coordinate]] transition functions on the overlap $\mathbb{C} - \{0\}$ given by

$$
  z_2 = z_1^{-1}
  \,.
$$

The 2-sphere is moreover a [[Kähler manifold]] and of course [[compact topological space|compact]]. Therefore by prop. \ref{SpinstructureOnCompactKaehlerIsSquareRootOfCanonical} a spin structure on $S^2$ is equivalently a [[square root]] $\sqrt{\Omega^{1,0}} \in \mathbf{Line}_{\mathbb{C}}(S^2)$ of the [[canonical line bundle]] $\Omega^{1,0}$, which here is simply the holomorphic 1-form bundle.

Now hermitian [[complex line bundles]] on the 2-sphere are classified by $H^2(S^2, \mathbb{Z}) \simeq \mathbb{Z}$. By the [[clutching construction]] a line bundle given by two trivializing sections $\sigma_1, \sigma_2$ of the trivial line bundle on the coordinate patch $\mathbb{C}$ has class the [[winding number]] of the transition function

$$
  S^1 \hookrightarrow \mathbb{C} - \{0\}
  \stackrel{s_2 s_1^{-1}}{\to} \mathbb{C}^\times
  \,.
$$

Now the canonical section of the holomorphic 1-form bundle on $\mathbb{C}$ is simply the canonical 1-form $d z$ itself. By the above [[coordinate charts]] we have on $\mathbb{C} - \{0\}$

$$
  d z_2 = d (z_1^{-1}) = - z_1^{-2} d z_1
$$

and so the transition function of the canonical bundle in this local trivialization is 

$$
  - z^{-2} \colon \mathbb{C}-\{0\} \to \mathbb{C}^\times
  \,.
$$

This has winding number $\pm 2$. Therefore the [[first Chern class]] of the holomorphic 1-form bundle $\Omega^{1,0}$ is $c_1(\Omega^{1,0}) =  \pm 2$ (the sign being an arbitrary convention, determined by the identification $H^2(S^2, \mathbb{Z}) \simeq \mathbb{Z}$).

And so it follows that there is a unique spin structure, namely given by choosing $\sqrt{\Omega^{1,0}}$ to be the line bundle on $S^2$ with first Chern class $\pm 1$. 


To construct $\sqrt{\Omega^{1,0}}$ by local sections analogous to how we got $\Omega^{1,0}$ from the two sections $d z_1$ and $d z_2$, slice open $\mathbb{C}$ to $\mathbb{C} - [0,\infty)$ and consider one of the two $z_1^{-1/2} d z_1$ as a local section of the trivial complex line bundle. Do the same on the other patch. Then

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    z_2^{-1/2} d z_2 
    &= 
    z_1^{1/2} (-z_1^{-2} d z_1)
    \\
    &=  -z_1^{-1}\left(z_1^{-1/2} dz_1\right)
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

This is well defined also over the cut and so we can patch the cut with any small neighbourhood with any section chosen over it and conclude that these sections are the local sections locally trivializing a bundle of class $\pm 1$ and hence that of $\sqrt{\Omega^{1,0}}$.







## Higher spin structures
 {#Higher}

Spin structures are one step in a tower of conditions that are related to the [[quantum anomaly]] cancellation of higher dimensional spinning/super [[branes]].

This is controled by the [[Whitehead tower]] of the [[classifying space]]/[[delooping]] of the [[orthogonal group]] $O(n)$, which starts out as

$$
  \array{
    & Whitehead tower
    \\
    &\vdots
    \\
    & B Fivebrane &\to& \cdots &\to& *
    \\
    & \downarrow && && \downarrow
    \\
    second frac Pontr. class & B String &\to& \cdots &\stackrel{\tfrac{1}{6}p_2}{\to}&  B^8 \mathbb{Z}
    &\to& * 
    \\
    & \downarrow && && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    first frac Pontr. class & B Spin && && &\stackrel{\tfrac{1}{2}p_1}{\to}& B^4 \mathbb{Z} &\to & * 
    \\
    & \downarrow && && \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    second SW class & B S O 
    &\to&
    \cdots
    &\to&
    &\to&
    & \stackrel{w_2}{\to} &
    B^2 \mathbb{Z}_2
    &\to&
    *
    \\
    & \downarrow && && \downarrow && \downarrow &&  \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    first SW class & B O 
    &\to&
    \cdots
    &\to&
    \tau_{\leq 8 } B O
    &\to&
    \tau_{\leq 4 } B O
    &\to&
    \tau_{\leq 2 } B O
    &\stackrel{w_1}{\to}&
    \tau_{\leq 1 } B O
    \simeq
    B \mathbb{Z}_2
    &
    Postnikov  tower
  }
$$


where the stages are the deloopings of

...
$\to$
[[fivebrane group]]
$\to$
[[string group]]
$\to$
[[spin group]]
$\to$
[[special orthogonal group]]
$\to$
[[orthogonal group]],

where lifts through the stages correspond to 

* [[orthogonal structure]]

* [[orientation]]

* [[spin structure]]

* [[string structure]]

* [[fivebrane structure]]

and where the [[obstruction]] classes are the [[universal characteristic classes]]

* [[first Stiefel-Whitney class]] $w_1$

* [[second Stiefel-Whitney class]] $w_2$

* [[Pontryagin class|first fractional Pontryagin class]] $\tfrac{1}{2}p_1$

* [[Pontryagin class|second fractional Pontryagin class]] $\tfrac{1}{6}p_2$

and where every possible square in the above is a [[homotopy pullback]] square (using the [[pasting law]]).

Notice that for instance $w_2$ is identified as such by using that $[S^2,-]$ preserves [[homotopy pullbacks]] and sends $ B O \to \tau_{\leq 2} B O$ to a [[weak homotopy equivalence|equivalence]], so that $B SO \to B^2 \mathbb{Z}$ is an [[isomorphism]] on the second [[homotopy group]] and hence by the [[Hurewicz theorem]] is also an isomorphism on the [[cohomology group]] $H^2(-,\mathbb{Z}_2)$. Analogously for the other characteristic maps.

In summary, more concisely, the tower is

$$
  \array{
    \vdots
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    B Fivebrane
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    B String &\stackrel{\tfrac{1}{6}p_2}{\to}& B^7 U(1) & \simeq B^8 \mathbb{Z}
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    B Spin &\stackrel{\tfrac{1}{2}p_1}{\to}& B^3 U(1) & \simeq B^4 \mathbb{Z}
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    B SO &\stackrel{w_2}{\to}& B^2 \mathbb{Z}_2
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    B O &\stackrel{w_1}{\to}& B \mathbb{Z}_2
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    \\
    B GL
  }
  \,,
$$

where each "hook" is a [[fiber sequence]].
