Given a [[field]] $k$, the $n$-th Weyl algebra $A_{n,k}$ is an associative unital algebra generated by the symbols $x_1,\ldots,x_n,\partial^1,\ldots,\partial^n$ modulo relations $x_i x_j = x_j x_i$, $\partial^i\partial^j = \partial^j\partial^i$ and $\partial^i x_j - x_j \partial^i = \delta^i_j$ (the Kronecker delta). In characteristics zero, it agrees with the algebra of [[regular differential operators]] on the $n$-dimensional affine space. 

Sometimes one considers the Weyl algebras over an arbitrary $k$-algebra $R$, including noncommutative, when the definition is simply $A_{n,k}\otimes_k R$. Another generalization are the symplectic Weyl algebras.
