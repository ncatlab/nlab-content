## Idea

In [[formal logic]] _modus ponens_ is the name of the [[deduction]] rule which says that from a [[sequent]]

$$
  \vdash \psi  \;\;\;\; (\psi \to \phi)
$$

asserting the [[judgement]] that a [[proposition]] $\psi$ is [[true]], as is the [[implication]] $(\psi \to \phi)$, then the [[judgement]]

$$
  \vdash \phi
$$

may be [[deduction|deduced]]. 

On more general [[types]] in [[type theory]] this is [[function application]].

## Properties

The converse to the modus ponents this is a [[deduction theorem]], see also at _[[metalanguage]]_.

The [[categorical semantics]] of the modus ponents in the form

$$
  \psi,\; (\psi \to \phi) \;\vdash \; \phi
$$

is the [[evaluation map]] of the ambient ([[locally cartesian closed category|locally]]) [[cartesian closed category]].
