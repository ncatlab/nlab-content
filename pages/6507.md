## Idea

The [[category theory|category theoretic]] notions of 

* _[[category]]_ and _[[object]]_ 

on the one hand and of 

* _[[theory]]_ and _[[model]]_ 

on the other have been suggested ([Lawvere](#Lawvere)) to usefully formalize, respectively, the heuristic notions 

* "general" and "particular" 

as well as 

* "abstract" and "concrete", respectively. 

We have:

* a ([[syntactic category]] of a) [[Lawvere theory]] $T$ (or the equivalent in any [[doctrine]]) $T$ is an _abstract general_;

* a (generating) [[object]] in $T$ is an _abstract particular_ ;

* the [[category]] $T Mod(E)$ of $T$-[[models]]/[[algebra over an algebraic theory|algebras]] in any context $E$ is a _concrete general_;

* an [[object]] of any $T Mod(E)$ is a _concrete particular_.

(In ([Lawvere](#Lawvere)) the item "abstract particular" is apparently not used.)

## Examples

### Groups

The [[syntactic category]] $T_{Grp}$ of the [[theory]] of [[group]]s is the "general abstract" of groups. Its essentially unique generating object is  _the abstract particular_ group.

The category $T_{Grp} Mod(Set) = $ [[Grp]] of all groups is the _concrete general_ of groups.

An object in there is some [[group]]: a concrete particular.
