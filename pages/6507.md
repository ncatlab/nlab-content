## Idea

The [[category theory|category theoretic]] notions of 

* _[[category]]_ and _[[object]]_ 

on the one hand and of 

* _[[theory]]_ and _[[model]]_ 

on the other have been suggested ([Lawvere](#Lawvere)) to usefully formalize, respectively, the heuristic notions 

* "general" and "particular" 

as well as 

* "abstract" and "concrete", respectively. 

We have:

* a ([[syntactic category]] of a) [[Lawvere theory]] $T$ (or the equivalent in any [[doctrine]]) $T$ is an _abstract general_;

* the [[category]] $T Mod(E)$ of $T$-[[models]]/[[algebra over an algebraic theory|algebras]] in any context $E$ is a _concrete general_;

* an [[object]] of any $T Mod(E)$ is a _particular_.

That seems to be roughly what is suggested in [Lawvere](#Lawvere). Of course one could play with this further and consider further refinement such as

* a (generating) [[object]] in $T$ is an _abstract particular_ ;

* an [[object]] of any $T Mod(E)$ is a _concrete particular_.




## Examples

### Groups

The [[syntactic category]] $T_{Grp}$ of the [[theory]] of [[group]]s is the "general abstract" of groups. Its essentially unique generating object is  _the abstract particular_ group.

The category $T_{Grp} Mod(Set) = $ [[Grp]] of all groups is the _concrete general_ of groups.

An object in there is some [[group]]: a concrete particular.

> [EL§61](Science+of+Logic#EL61) If we are to believe the Critical philosophy, thought is subjective, and its ultimate and invincible mode is abstract universality or formal identity. Thought is thus set in opposition to Truth, which is no abstraction, but concrete universality. In this highest mode of thought, which is entitled Reason, the Categories are left out of account. The extreme theory on the opposite side holds thought to be an act of the particular only, and on that ground declares it incapable of apprehending the Truth. This is the Intuitional theory.

> [§71](Science+of+Logic#71) It is only after profounder acquaintance with the other sciences that logic ceases to be for subjective spirit a merely abstract universal and reveals itself as the universal which embraces within itself the wealth of the particular 

> [§1323](Science+of+Logic#1323) This universal Notion, which we have now to consider here, contains the three moments: universality, particularity and individuality.

> [§1337b](Science+of+Logic#1337b) When people talk of the determinate Notion, what is usually meant is merely such an abstract universal.

> [§1599](Science+of+Logic#1599) Such a universal which merely subsumes, is an abstraction which only becomes concrete in something else, in the particular. End, on the contrary, is the concrete universal, which possesses in its own self the moment of particularity
