These two papers basically supply (via observations by [[Mike Shulman]], see _[[michaelshulman:StreetCBS]]_) definitions on the [[nLab:HomePage]] of [[regular 2-category]], [[coherent 2-category]], [[exact 2-category]], [[2-pretopos]], [[2-site]], [[2-sheaf]], and [[Grothendieck 2-topos]], as well as the proof of the [[2-Giraud theorem]].  The definitions we are interested in are the [[bicategory|bicategorical]] ones, which appear in the second paper, but the only proofs are in the first paper which does a strict version for strict 2-categories.  Note in particular that where he uses the prefix "bi-" we use either "2-" or no prefix; thus our 2-sites are what he calles bisites, etc.  There are also a couple of mistakes in the definitions and proofs which we have tried to correct in the relevant $n$Lab entries.
