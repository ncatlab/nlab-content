
## Definition

Synonym for _functors between which there exists at least one [[natural isomorphism]]_.


## Relation to functor categories 

If $F_0,F_1\colon\mathcal{C}\rightarrow\mathcal{D}$ are functors, and _if_ the concept of [[functor category]] $[\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D}]$ has been defined, then

$F_0$ and $F_1$ are isomorphic functors 

if and only if 

$F_0$ and $F_1$ are isomorphic objects in the functor category $[\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D}] $.


Notably, the notion of _isomorphic functors_ does not need the concept of [[functor categories]] which involves foundational considerations that prompt some authors to make cautionary remarks about there being such a thing as a category of all functors from $\mathcal{C}$ to $\mathcal{D}$ at all (cf. e.g. [Auslander (1971, p.9)](#Auslander1971)) 

## Remarks

A fundamental use of the concept of isomorphic functors is the usual definition of [[equivalent categories]] which involves functors isomorphic to [[identity functor]]s 

### Defining isomorphism of objects and isomorphism of functors

In any category $\mathcal{C}$, and for any objects $O$ and $O'$ of $\mathcal{C}$, the following are equivalent:

* $O$ and $O'$ are [[isomorphic]] in $\mathcal{C}$,

* the hom-functors $\mathcal{C}(-,O)$ and $\mathcal{C}(-,O')$ are isomorphic functors,

* the hom-functors $\mathcal{C}(O,-)$ and $\mathcal{C}(O',-)$ are isomorphic functors.

### Isomorphic functors and limits

If $F_0,F_1\colon\mathcal{C}\rightarrow\mathcal{D}$ are isomorphic functors, and if $X\colon \mathcal{I}\rightarrow \mathcal{D}$ is a [[diagram]], then 

$F_0$ preserves limits over $X$,

if and only if


$F_1$ preserves limits over $X$.
