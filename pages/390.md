### Orthogonal factorization systems

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

Let $C$ be a [[category]] and let $(E,M)$ be two [[classes]] of [[morphisms]] in 
$C$. We say that $(E,M)$ is an **orthogonal factorization system** if $(E,M)$ is a [[weak factorization system]] in which solutions to lifting problems are unique.

We spell out several equivalent explicit formulation of what this means.

###### Definition

$(E,M)$ is an **orthogonal factorization system** if
every morphism $f$ in $C$ factors $f = r\circ \ell$ as a morphism $\ell \in E$ followed by a morphism $r \in M$; and the following equivalent conditions hold

1. We have:
 
   1. $E$ is precisely the class of morphisms that are left [[orthogonality|orthogonal]] to every morphism in $M$;

   1. $M$ is precisely the class of morphisms that are right [[orthogonality|orthogonal]] to every morphism in $E$.

1. We have:

   1. The factorization is unique up to unique [[isomorphism]].

   1. $E$ and $M$ both contain all [[isomorphisms]] and are closed under composition.

1. We have:

   1. $E$ and $M$ are [[replete subcategories]] of the [[arrow category]] $C^I$.

   1. Every morphism in $E$ is left [[orthogonality|orthogonal]] to every morphism in $M$.

OFS's are traditionally called just **factorization systems**.
See the _[[joyalscatlab:Factorization systems|Catlab]]_ for more of the theory.

An orthogonal factorization system is called **proper** if every morphism in $E$ is an [[epimorphism]] and every morphism in $M$ is a [[monomorphism]].


### Prefactorization systems

For any class $E$ of morphisms in $C$, we write $E^\perp$ for the class of all morphisms that are right orthogonal to every morphism in $E$.  Dually, given $M$ we write ${}^\perp M$ for the class of all morphisms that are  left orthogonal to every morphism in $M$.  The second condition in the definition of an OFS then says that $E= {}^\perp M$ and $M= E^\perp$.

In general, $(-)^\perp$ and ${}^\perp(-)$ form a [[Galois connection]] on the [[poset]] of classes of morphisms in $C$.  A pair $(E,M)$ such that $E= {}^\perp M$ and $M= E^\perp$ is sometimes called a **prefactorization system**.  Note that by generalities about Galois connections, for any class $A$ of maps we have prefactorization systems $({}^\perp(A^\perp),A^\perp)$ and $({}^\perp A, ({}^\perp A)^\perp)$.  We call these *generated* and *cogenerated* by $A$, respectively.

A prefactorization systems $(E,M)$ (and hence, also, a factorization system) satisfies the following closure properties.  We state them  for $M$, but $E$ of course satisfies the dual property.

* $M$ contains the isomorphisms and is closed under composition and [[pullback]] (insofar as pullbacks exist in $C$).
* If a composite $f g$ is in $M$, and $f$ is either in $M$ or a [[monomorphism]], then $g$ is in $M$.
* $M$ is closed under all [[limits]] in the [[arrow category]] $Arr(C)$.

If $C$ is a [[locally presentable category]], then for any *small set* of maps $A$, the prefactorization system $({}^\perp(A^\perp),A^\perp)$ is actually a factorization system.  The argument is by a transfinite construction similar to the [[small object argument]].

On the other hand, if $(E,M)$ is any prefactorization system for which $M$ consists of monomorphisms and $C$ is [[complete category|complete]] and [[well-powered category|well-powered]], then $(E,M)$ is actually a factorization system.  (Of course, there is a dual statement as well.)  In fact something slightly more general is true; see [[M-complete category]] for this and other related ways to construct factorization systems.

###### Proposition

For $(L,R)$ an orthogonal factorization system. Let

$$
  \array{
    && Y
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{f}}\nearrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{g}}
    \\
    X
    &&
    \stackrel{g \circ f}{\to}
    &&
    Z
  }
$$

be two composable morphisms. Then

* If $f$ and $g \circ f$ are in $L$, then so is $g$.

* If $g$ and $g\circ f$ are in $R$, then so is $f$.

## Examples 
 {#Examples}

Several classical examples of OFS $(E,M)$:

* in any [[topos]] or [[pretopos]], $E$ = class of all epis, $M$ = class of all monos: the [[(epi, mono) factorization system]];

* more generally, in any [[regular category]], $E$ = class of all [[regular epimorphisms]], $M$ = class of all monos

* in any [[quasitopos]], $E$ = all epimorphisms, $M$ = all [[strong monomorphisms]]

* In [[Cat]], $E$ = [[bo functors]], $M$ = [[fully faithful functors]]: the [[bo-ff factorization system]]

* (Street) in [[Cat]], $E$ = 0-[[final functors]], $M$ = [[discrete fibration]]s 

* (Street) in $\mathrm{Cat}$,  $M$ = 0-[[initial functors]], $M$ = [[discrete opfibration]]s

* in $\mathrm{Cat}$, $M$ = [[conservative functor]]s, $E$ = left orthogonal of $M$ ("iterated strict localizations" after A. Joyal)

* in the category of small categories where morphisms are functors which are [[exact functor|left exact]] and have [[right adjoint]]s, $E$ = class of all such functors which are also localizations, $M$ = class of all such functors which are also conservative

* if $F\to C$ is a [[fibered category]] in the sense of Grothendieck, then $F$ admits a factorization system $(E,M)$ where $E$ = arrows whose projection to $C$ is invertible, $M$ = cartesian arrows in $F$
