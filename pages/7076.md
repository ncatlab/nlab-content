## Idea

A _cartesian closed model category_ is a [[cartesian closed category]] that is equipped with the structure of a [[monoidal model category]] in a compatible way.

## Definition

A **cartesian model category** (following Rezk (2010) and Simpson (2012)) is a cartesian closed category equipped with a [[model category|model structure]] that satisfies the following additional axioms:

* ([[pushout-product axiom|Pushout–product axiom]]). If $f : X \to Y$ and $f' : X' \to Y'$ are cofibrations, then the induced morphism $(Y \times X') \cup^{X \times X'} (X \times Y') \to Y \times Y'$ is a cofibration that is trivial if either $f$ or $f'$ is.

* (Unit axiom). The [[terminal object]] is cofibrant.
