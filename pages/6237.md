## Definition

There are many notions of a character for an algebraic structure, often topologized. 

### Character on a group

A character on the [[group]] $G$ is a [[homomorphism]] into the [[group of units]] of the [[ground field]]. Regarding that the codomain is abelian, the collection of characters is itself an [[abelian group]] under the pointwise multiplication, this is called the **[[character lattice]]**

$$
  Hom(G,k^\times) 
$$

of the group. Similarly the **cocharacter lattice** is $Hom(k^\times, G)$.

For more see at [[group character]].

For [[topological groups]] one considers [[continuous map|continuous]] characters. Specifically, for a [[locally compact Hausdorff]] group $G$ (often further assumed to be an [[abelian group]]), a __character__ of $G$ is continuous homomorphism to the [[circle]] group $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$. If $G$ is [[profinite group|profinite]], then this is the same as an continuous homomorphism to the [[discrete space|discrete]] group $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$.  (See [MO](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/86089/two-definitions-of-character-of-topological-groups).)


### Character of a representation

In [[representation theory]], one defines the character of a representation $\rho\colon G\to End(V)$ to be the function on $G$ given by $g \mapsto Tr \rho(g)$, whenever the [[trace]] in $V$ makes sense (e.g. when $V$ is finite-dimensional).  Since such a function is invariant under conjugation, we may equivalently consider it a function on the set of conjugacy classes of elements in $G$.

Sometimes we also extend a character linearly to the free vector space on the set of conjugacy classes.  This version of the character can be identified with the [[bicategorical trace]] of the identity map of the representation, considered as a $k[G]$-$k$-module.

There is a different notion of an _infinitesimal character_ in [[Harish–Chandra theory]] and also a notion of the _formal character_.

There are important formulas concerning characters in representation theory, like [[Weyl character formula]], Kirillov character formula, Demazure character formula and so on.  There is also a formula for the [[induced character]] of an [[induced representation]].

### Left and right characters on a ring over a ring

Let $A$ be a unital, not necessarily commutative, [[ring]] (or, more generally, $k$-algebra for $k$-commutative); then a monoid in a category of $A$-bimodules (which are respectively also compatibly $k$-modules), is called an $A$-ring. In other words an $A$-ring $B$ is an object in the [[coslice category]] $A\Ring$; it is thus a ring $B$ equipped with multiplication $\mu_B$ and a map $\eta: A\to B$ of rings. 

A __left character__ of an $A$-ring $(B,\mu_B,\eta_B)$ is a map $\chi:B\to A$ such that 

(i) (left $A$-linearity) 
$\chi(\eta(a)b) = a\chi(b)$ for all $a\in A$, $b\in B$ 

(ii) (associativity) $\chi(b b') = \chi(b (\eta\circ\chi)(b'))$ for all $b,b'\in B$

(iii) (unitality) $\chi(1_B) = \chi(1_A)$ 

where we denoted multiplication in $A$ and in $B$ by concatenation. The conditions on $\chi$ can be restated as 
the requirement that the map $B\otimes A\to A$ given by 
$b\otimes a\mapsto \chi(b\eta(a))$ is a $B$-action extending 
the left regular $A$-action (i.e. the multiplication on $A$ 
considered as a left action).

Dually, a __right character__ of an $A$-ring $(B,\mu_B,\eta_B)$ is a map $\chi:B\to A$ such that 

(i) (right $A$-linearity) 
$\chi(b\eta(a)) = \chi(b)a$ for all $a\in A$, $b\in B$ 

(ii) (associativity) $\chi(b b') = \chi((\eta\circ\chi)(b) b')$ for all $b,b'\in B$

(iii) (unitality) $\chi(1_B) = \chi(1_A)$ 

This is in turn equivalent to extending the right regular action of $A$ to the action of $B$ on $A$.


### Character of a topological space

The character $\chi(X,x)$ of a [[topological space]] $X$ at a point $x$ is the minimal cardinality of a local basis of neighborhoods of point $x$ (local [[topological basis|basis of topology]] on $X$) if it is infinite and aleph zero otherwise. The character of a topological space is the supremum of $\chi(X,x)$ when $x$ runs through $X$.
