## Character on a group

There are many notions of a character for an algebraic structure, often topologized. A character on the [[group]] $G$ is homomorphism into the group of units (invertible elements) of the ground field. Regarding that the codomain is abelian, set of characters is an abelian group under the pointwise multiplication. for toplogical groups one considers continuous characters. 

## Character of a representation

In [[representation theory]], one defines the character of the representation $\rho: G\to End(V)$ to be the function on $G$ (or equivalently on the set of conjugacy classes of elements in $G$) given by $g\mapsto Tr \rho(g)$, whenever the trace in $V$ makes sense.

There is a different notion of an _infinitesimal character_ in Harish-Chandra theory and also a notion of the _formal character_.

There are important formulas concerning characters in representation theory, like Weyl character formula, Kirillov character formula, Demazure character formula and so on. 

## Character of a topological space

The character $\chi(X,x)$ of a [[topological space]] $X$ at a point $x$ is the minimal cardinality of a local basis of neighborhoods of point $x$ (local [[basis of topology]]) if it is infinite and aleph zero otherwise. The character of a topological space is the supremum of $\chi(X,x)$ when $x$ runs through $X$.
