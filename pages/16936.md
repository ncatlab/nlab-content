## Idea

In [[intuitionistic type theory]] the perspective of [[propositions as types]] identifies [[mere propositions]] with (speaking in [[categorical semantics]]) [[monomorphisms]] into the given [[context]] type. If one instead considers [[linear type theory]] then it makes sense to consider those propositions, in this sense, which come from monomorphisms that are [[split monomorphisms]], hence those for which there is a [[projection]] from the context to the [[subobject]] that represents the proposition. For these one might speak of "propositions as projections".

For instance in a category of [[Hilbert spaces]], regarded as semantics for bare multiplicative [[linear type theory]], then projections corespond to (closed) linear subspaces. These are just the propositions in the corresponding [[quantum logic]]. If we regard the propositions _as_ the projection, then it is natural to think of it as being the _application_ of the projection, in that the truth of the proposition is thought of as the image of applying this projection. In terms of [[quantum physics]] this relation between propositions (about a [[quantum mechanical system]]) and the projection onto the coresponding subspace of the [[space of quantum states]] is what is referred to as the "collapse of the [[wave function]]".
