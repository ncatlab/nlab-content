An __inner automorphism__ $\phi:G\to G$ of a group $G$ is any [[automorphism]] $\phi_g$ of the form $h\mapsto ghg^{-1}$. The inner automorphisms make a subgroup $Inn(G)$ of the group of automorphisms $Aut(G)$ which is the image of the natural map $G\to Aut(G)$, $g\mapsto\phi_g$. The [[center]] of a group $G$ is precisely the kernel of this map. Similarly, the monoidal center due Drinfel'd and Majid, in the case when the monoidal category is Picard is a 2-categorical kernel (an observation due L. Breen). 

Higher categorical analogues of the inner automorphism group were studied by Roberts and Schreiber.
