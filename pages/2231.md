An __inner automorphism__ $\phi:G\to G$ of a group $G$ is any [[automorphism]] $\phi_g$ of the form $h\mapsto g h g^{-1}$. The inner automorphisms form a [[subgroup]] $Inn(G)$, called the __inner automorphism group__ of $G$, of the entire [[automorphism group]] $Aut(G)$; it is the [[image]] of the natural map $G\to Aut(G)$ given by $g\mapsto\phi_g$. The [[center]] of a group $G$ is precisely the [[kernel]] of this natural map. Similarly, the monoidal center due to Drinfel'd and Majid, in the case when the monoidal category is Picard, is a $2$-category-theoretic kernel (an observation due to L. Breen). 

Higher analogues of the inner automorphism group were studied by Roberts and Schreiber.
