## Idea

In [[quantum field theory]], the term _minimal coupling_ refers to the kind of interaction betweem [[fermion|fermionic]] [[particles]] and [[force]] [[gauge fields]].

The [[force]] [[gauge fields]] are modeled by [[connection on a bundle|principal connections]] on a $G$-[[principal bundle]] where $G$ is the [[gauge group]] of the given [[gauge theory]]. (For instance $G = U(1) \times SU(2) \times SU(3)$ in the [[standard model of particle physics]]). 

The [[matter]] fields are [[sections]] $\psi$ of a [[spinor bundle]] [[associated bundle|associated]] to this [[principal bundle]]. Therefore there is an induced [[connection on a vector bundle]] $\nabla$ on this spinor bundle. 

Let $D_\nabla$ be the [[Dirac operator]] of the given [[Riemannian metric]] and this conneciton $\nabla$. The **minimal coupling** term in the [[action functional]] on the space of these sections is

$$
  S_{gc}(\nabla, \psi) = \int_\Sigma \langle \psi, D_\nabla \psi\rangle
  \,.
$$

## Examples

All the couplings appearin in the [[standard model of particle physics]] are "minimal" in this sense.
