A. Suslin and [[Vladimir Voevodsky|V. Voevodsky]] have realized a [[triangulated category]] $D^b(\mathcal{MM}_k)$ which is supposed to be the bounded derived category of the hypothetical abelian category of [[mixed motive]]s over $k$, predicted by Grothendieck--Beilinson--Deligne. There are variants developed by Hanamura and M. Levine. There is a different "derived" approach to mixed motives, namely the $A^1$-homotopy theory of [[F. Morel]] and [[V. Voevodsky]]. Voevodsky used the derived category of mixed motives to solve [[Milnor's conjecture]] in [[algebraic K-theory]].
