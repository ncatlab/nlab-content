## Idea

[[A. Suslin]] and [[Vladimir Voevodsky|V. Voevodsky]] have realized a [[triangulated category]] $D^b(\mathcal{MM}_k)$ which is supposed to be the bounded [[derived category]] of the hypothetical [[abelian category]] of [[mixed motives]] over $k$, predicted by Grothendieck--Beilinson--Deligne. 
There are variants developed by Hanamura and M. Levine. There is a different "derived" approach to mixed motives, namely the $A^1$-homotopy theory of [[F. Morel]] and [[V. Voevodsky]]. 


See at _[[motive]]_ the section _[Contructions of the derived category of mixed motives](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/motive#DerivedMotives)_.

## Applications

Voevodsky used the derived category of mixed motives to solve [[Milnor's conjecture]] in [[algebraic K-theory]].
