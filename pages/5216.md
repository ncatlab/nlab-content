## Idea

One form of the [[bicategory#Coherence|coherence theorem for bicategories]] states that every [[bicategory]] is equivalent to a [[strict 2-category]].  **Lack's coherence theorem** (named for [[Steve Lack]]) states that every naturally-occurring bicategory is [[equivalence of bicategories|equivalent]] to a naturally occurring strict 2-category.  

{#NotATheorem} Since the notion of "naturally occuring" here is informal (undefined), this is not a [[theorem]] in the usual sense, but rather an observation about a number of examples.

## Examples

Instances of Lack's coherence theorem include:

* The bicategory [[Prof]] of [[small categories]] and [[profunctors]] is equivalent to the strict 2-category of [[presheaf categories]] and [[cocontinuous functors]].

* The bicategory [[Span]](C) of [[spans]] in a category $C$ with [[pullbacks]] is equivalent to the strict 2-category of [[slice categories]] of $C$ and [[linear polynomial functors]].

* More generally, the bicategory of "polynomial data" in a [[locally cartesian closed category]] is equivalent to the strict 2-category of slices and [[polynomial functors]].
