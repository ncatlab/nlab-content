Proper homotopy theory is both an old and a fair new area of algebraic topology.
It deals with properties of non-compact spaces, that cannot be detected using maps from  simplices in. 

Historically the subject is traced back to Kerekjarto's classification of non-compact surfaces in 1923, but its emergence as an importatn tool in geometric topology came with Larry Siebenmann's wotk in 1965.

Suppose $M$ is a _smooth_ manifold with boundary, $\partial M$, then $M\setminus \partial M$ is an open manifold. Now suppose someone gives us an open manifold $N$, is it possible to detect if there is a compact manifold $M$, with $M\setminus \partial \cong N$.  Siebenmann showed that certain conditions on the _ends_ of $N$ were necessary and that there were obstructions if the dimension of $M$ was greater than 5.

Its potential importance of proper homotopy, 
for example for physical applications, comes from the fact that the phenomena it studies include the limiting behaviour of the system.

##Intuitions##
The basic hypothesis will be that $X$ will be a connected locally connected compact Hausdorff space, which is also locally connected. It will usually be $\simga$-compact, i.e., there will be an increasing sequence, $\{K_n\}$, of compact subspaces with each $K_n$ in the interior of $K_{n+1}$ and such that 

$$X = \bigcup^\infty_{n=0}K_n,$$

These spaces will most often than not be locally finite simplicial complexes.

We will  be interested in the homotopy of such spaces 'out towards its ends' 


###Ends###
To illustrate the idea of the ends of a space $X$, we note that naively $\mathbb{R}$ has two ends, $\infty$ and $-\infty$, whilst $\mathbb{R}^2$ has only one as it is $S^2\setminus \{\infty\}$, (but that is vague!).

More exactly, considerthe system of spaces

$$\epsilon(X) = \{closure(X\setminus K) : K compact \sunset X\},$$

This is an inverse system or [[pro-object]] in the category of spaces. Applying the connected component functor, $\pi_0$, to this system of spaces gives $\pi_0(X)$, and, classically, one takes the limit of this to get 

$$e(X) = lim \pi_0\epsilon(X),$$
the _set of ends_ of $X$. In general, $e(X)$ would be given the [[inverse limit topology]], to preserve more of the information coming from its construction.  This space is the _space of (Freudenthal) ends of $X$_. It is a [[profinite space]].
