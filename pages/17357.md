## Idea

The concept of _reduced cyclinder_ is the analog for [[pointed objects]] of [[cylinder]] constructions.

Specifically in [[topological spaces]], with $I = [0,1] \in $ [[Top]] the standard topological interval and $I_+ \in Top^{\ast/}$ its version with a basepoint freely adjoined, then for $X$ a [[pointed topological space]], the **standard reduced cylinder** over it is the [[smash product]]

$$
  X \wedge (I_+) \;\; \in Top^{\ast/}
  \,.
$$ 

This is obtained from the ordinary standard cylinder $X \times I$ by collapsing the copy of $I$ that sits over the basepoint of $X$.

The [[mapping cone]] of $X \to \ast$ formed with the standard reduced cylinder is the [[reduced suspension]] of $X$.

Applying the reduced cylinder construction degreewise to a [[sequential spectrum]] yields the standard [[cylinder spectrum]] construction.
