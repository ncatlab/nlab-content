## Idea

The _coherence theorem for [[symmetric monoidal categories]]_, like many [[coherence theorems]], has several forms (or, alternatively, refers to several different theorems):

1. Every diagram in a free [[symmetric monoidal category]] made up of [[associators]] and [[unitors]] and symmetries, and in which both sides have the same underlying [[permutation]], commutes.

1. The free symmetric monoidal category on some given data is equivalent to the free [[symmetric strict monoidal category]] on the same data.

1. Every symmetric monoidal category is symmetric-monoidally equivalent to a symmetric strict monoidal category.

1. Every symmetric monoidal category is equivalent to an [[unbiased symmetric monoidal category]].

1. The forgetful 2-functor $SymMonCat \to SymStrMonCat$ has a strict [[left adjoint]] and the components of the unit are equivalences in $SymMonCat$.

Note that in a symmetric strict monoidal category, the associators and unitors are identities, but the symmetry is not in general.
