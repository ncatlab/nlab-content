By the general rules of $(n,r)$-[[(n,r)-category|categories]], a $(1,0)$-category is an $\infty$-[[infinity-category|category]] such that

* any $j$-morphism is an [[equivalence]], for $j \gt 0$;
* any two parallel $j$-morphisms are equivalent, for $j \gt 1$.

You can start from any notion of $\infty$-category, strict or weak; up to [[equivalence of categories|equivalence]], the result is always the same as a [[groupoid]].
