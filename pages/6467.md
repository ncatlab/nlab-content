## Idea

Generally, given a [[monoidal category]] $(C, \otimes)$, its _Picard group_ is the group of [[isomorphism class]]es of [[object]]s that have an [[inverse]] under the [[tensor product]] -- the [[line object]]s. Or rather, more naturally (before [[decategorification]]), it is the maximal [[2-group]] inside a monoidal category.

More specifically, what is often meant by _Picard group_ is the special case of this general notion where $C$ is a category of [[vector bundle]]s or more generally [[quasicoherent sheaves]] or similar. In this case the Picard group consists of the [[line bundle]]s.

For instance the locally free [[sheaves]] of [[module]]s of [[rank]] $1$ over the [[structure sheaf]] of a [[ringed space]] $X$ form a group often called _the Picard group of $X$._


## Definition

Let $X$ be a [[ringed space]]. The **Picard group** denoted $Pic(X)$ is defined to be the set of 
[[isomorphism class]]es of locally free $\mathcal{O}_X$-[[modules]] of [[rank]] $1$ with group operation given by the [[tensor product]]. Note that locally free $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules of rank one are also called *invertible sheaves*.

## Pic(X) is a Group

First, if $\mathcal{L}$ and $\mathcal{M}$ are elements of $Pic(X)$, then $\mathcal{L}\otimes \mathcal{M}$ is still locally free of rank $1$ as can be seen by taking intersections of the trivializing covers. So $Pic(X)$ is closed under tensor product.

There is an identity element, since $\mathcal{O}_X\otimes \mathcal{L}\simeq \mathcal{L}$. The tensor product is associative.

Lastly, given any invertible sheaf $\mathcal{L}$ we check that $\mathcal{L}^\wedge=\mathcal{Hom}(\mathcal{L}, \mathcal{O}_X)$ is its inverse. Consider $\mathcal{L}^\wedge \otimes \mathcal{L}\simeq \mathcal{Hom}(\mathcal{L}, \mathcal{L})\simeq \mathcal{O}_X$.

## Alternate Forms

Suppose that $X$ is an integral [[scheme]] over a [[field]]. The correspondence between [[Cartier divisor]]s and invertible sheaves is given by $D\mapsto \mathcal{O}_X(D)$. If $D$ is represented by $\{(U_i, f_i)\}$, then $\mathcal{O}_X(D)$ is $\mathcal{O}_X$-submodule of $\mathcal{K}$, the sheaf of quotients, generated by $f_i^{-1}$ on $U_i$. Under our assumptions, this map is an isomorphism between the Cartier class divisor group and Picard group, but for a general scheme it is only injective. Under the additional assumptions that $X$ is [[separated scheme|separated]] and locally factorial, we get an isomorphism between the class divisor group and $Pic(X)$.

Another form the Picard group takes is from the isomorphism $Pic(X)\simeq H^1(X, \mathcal{O}_X^*)$. The isomorphism is most easily seen by looking at the transition functions for a trivializing cover of $\mathcal{L}$. Suppose $(\phi_i)$ trivialize $\mathcal{L}$ over the cover $(U_i)$. Then $\phi_i^{-1}\circ \phi_j$ is an automorphism of $\mathcal{O}_{U_i\cap U_j}$, i.e. a section of $\mathcal{O}_X^*(U_i\cap U_j)$. One can check this defines a [[Cech cohomology|Cech cocycle]] $\check{H}^1(\mathcal{U}, \mathcal{O}_X^*)$ which is isomorphic to the abelian [[sheaf cohomology]] $H^1(X, \mathcal{O}_X^*)$.
