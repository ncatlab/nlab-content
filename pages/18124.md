###### Proposition
**(quotient projections out of compact Hausdorff spaces are closed precisely if the codomain is Hausdorff)**

Let

$$
  \pi \;\colon\; (X, \tau_X) \longrightarrow (Y, \tau_Y)
$$

be a [[continuous function]] between [[topological spaces]] such that

1. $(X, \tau)$ is a [[compact Hausdorff topological space]];

1. $\pi$ is a [[surjection]] and $\tau_Y$ is the corresponding [[quotient topological space|quotient topology]].

Then the following are equivalent

1. $(Y, \tau_Y)$ is itself a [[Hausdorff topological space]];

1. $\pi$ is a [[closed map]].

###### Proof

The implicaton $\left( (Y, \tau_Y)\, \text{Hausdorff} \right) \Rightarrow \left( \pi \, \text{closed}  \right)$
follows since [[maps from compact spaces to Hausdorff spaces are closed and proper|maps from compact spaces to Hausdorff spaces are closed]]. We need to show the converse.

Hence assume that $\pi$ is a closed map. We need to show that for every pair of
distinct points $y_1 \neq y_2 \in Y$ there exist [[open neighbourhoods]] $U_{y_1}, U_{y_2} \in \tau_Y$
which are disjoint, $U_{y_1} \cap U_{y_2} = \emptyset$.

First notice that the [[singleton]] subsets $\{x\}, \{y\} \in Y$ are closed. This is because they are images
of singleton subsets in $X$, by surjectivity of $f$, and because singletons in a Hausdorff space are closed, and because images under $f$ of 
closed subsets are closed, by the assumption that $f$ is a closed map.

It follows that the [[pre-images]]

$$
  C_1 \coloneqq \pi^{-1}(\{y_1\})
  \phantom{AA}
  C_2 \coloneqq \pi^{-1}(\{y_2\})
  \,.
$$

are [[closed subsets]] of $X$.

Now since [[compact Hausdorff spaces are normal]] it follows that we may find disjoint open subset $U_1, U_2 \in \tau_X$
such that

$$
  C_1 \subset U_1 \phantom{AAA} C_2 \subset U_2
  \,.
$$

Moreover, by [this lemma](saturated+subset#SaturatedOpenNeighbourhoodsOfSaturatedClosedSubsets) we may find these $U_i$ such that they
are both [[saturated subsets]]. Therefore finally [this lemma](saturated+subset#DetectViaSaturatedSubsetsContinuousQuotientMap)
says that the images $\pi(U_i)$ are open in $(Y,\tau_Y)$. These are now clearly disjoint open neighbourhoods of $y_1$ and $y_2$.

Consider the function

$$
  \array{
     [0,2\pi]/\sim &\longrightarrow& S^1 \subset \mathbb{R}^2
     \\
     t &\mapsto& (cos(t), sin(t))
  }
$$

* from the [[quotient topological space]] of the [[closed interval]] 
  by the [[equivalence relation]] which identifies the two endpoints

  $$
    (x \sim y) \;\Leftrightarrow\; \left( \left( x = y\right) \,\text{or}\, \left( \left( x \in \{0,2\pi\}\right)  \,\text{and}\, \left( y\in \{0, 2\pi\} \right)   \right) \right)
  $$

* to the unit [[circle]] $S^1 = S_0(1) \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ 
regarded as a [[topological subspace]] of the 2-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]  equipped with its
[[metric topology]] .

This is clearly a [[continuous function]] and a [[bijection]] on the underlying sets.
Moreover, since [[continuous images of compact spaces are compact]] 
and since the closed interval $[0,1]$ is compact we also obtain another proof that
the [[circle]] is compact.

Hence since [[continuous bijections from compact spaces to Hausdorff spaces are homeomorphisms]] the above map is in fact a [[homeomorphism]]

$$
  [0,2\pi]/\sim \;\simeq\; S^1
  \,.
