## Idea

Schur-Weyl duality is a relation between the [[finite-dimensional vector space|finite-dimensional]] [[irreducible representations]] of the [[general linear groups]] $GL(k)$ and of the [[symmetric group]] $Sym(n)$.

Concretely, for $k, n \in \mathbb{N}$ consider the $k \times n$-dimensional [[complex vector space]]; regarded as a [[tensor product of vector spaces|tensor product]] of $n$ copies of $\mathbb{C}^n$:

$$
  \underset{
    n \; tensor \; factors
  }{
    \underbrace{
      \mathbb{C}^k \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbb{C}^k
    }
  }
  \;\;\;
  \in
  \;
  \mathbb{C}VectorSpaces
$$

As such, this carries 

* a canonical [[linear representation|linear]] [[group action]] by $GL(k) \coloneqq GL(k,\mathbb{C})$, namely the $n$-fold [[diagonal action]] of its defining action on $\mathbb{C}^k$ (its [[fundamental representation]]);

* a canonical [[linear representation|linear]] [[group action]] by $Sym(n)$ given by [[permutation]] of the $n$ tensor factors.

The statement of Schur-Weyl duality is that the decomposition of this [[linear representation]] of the [[direct product group]] $GL(k) \times Sym(n)$ decomposes as a [[direct sum]] of [[tensor product of vector spaces|tensor products]] of [[irreducible representations]] for either group, as follows:

$$
  \underset{
    n \; tensor \; factors
  }{
    \underbrace{
      \mathbb{C}^k \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbb{C}^k
    }
  }
  \;\simeq\;
  \underset{
    {
    (\lambda_1 \geq \cdots \geq \lambda_k)
    }
    \atop
    {
    \underset{i}{\sum} \lambda_i = n
    }
  }{\oplus}
  D^{(\lambda)}
  \otimes
  S^{(\lambda)}
$$

Here the [[direct sum]] is indexed by [[partitions]] $\lambda$ of $n$ by $k$ [[positive number|positive]] summands, and $D^{(\lambda)}$ and $S^{(\lambda)}$ denote the [[irreducible representations]] of the [[general linear group]] and of the [[symmetric group]] ([[Specht modules]]), respectively, which are indexed by these according to the [[representation theory of the general linear group]] and the [[representation theory of the symmetric group]], respectively.
