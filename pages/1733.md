## Idea

Algebraic topology is generally the study of [[functor]]s from [[nice categories of spaces]] to [[algebraic category|algebraic categories]].  This can be considered, from the nPOV, as closely related to higher [[category theory]]. Category theory  originally developed out of algebraic topology, where it was used first simply to describe what was going on and then to axiomatise [[Eilenberg-Steenrod cohomology]] theories. There has been considerable convergence of the two subjects, not only in methodology, but in aims and motivations.
