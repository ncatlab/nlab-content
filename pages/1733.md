## Idea

_Algebraic topology_ refers to the application of methods of [[algebra]] to problems in [[topology]]. More specifically,
the method of algebraic topology is to assign invariants to
[[topological space]]s, or more systematically, to the construction 
and applications of functors from some category of topological objects 
(e.g. [[Hausdorff space]]s, topological [[fibre bundle]]s) to some algebraic category (e.g. Abelian groups,
modules over the [[Steenrod algebra]]).
Landing in algebraic category aids to the computability, 
but typically looses some information (say getting from 
a topological spaces with continuum or more points 
to rather discrete algebraic structures).
The basic aim is to attack a classification problem (for
spaces or maps) or existence of maps 
(typically the problems for finding 
[[lifting]], [[section]], [[extension]] and [[retraction]], 
cf. [[basic problems of algebraic topology]])
and, more rarely, the uniqueness problem for maps. 
With the development of the subject, however the invariants 
and the objects of algebraic topology are not
only used to attack these problems but also to characterize
the conditions and to have the language for various constructions 
(say vanishing conditions, conditions on characteristic class,
dual classes, products).

#### The idea of functorial invariants

The basic idea of the functorial method for the problem of existence of morphisms is the following: 
If $F:A\to B$ is a [[functor]] 
(we present here a general statement, but in the above context 
$A$ is a category of topological objects
and $B$ some category of algebraic objects) 
and $d:D\to A$ a [[diagram]] in $A$ then
$F\circ d$ is a diagram in $B$. 
If one can fill certain additional
arrow $f$ in the diagram $d$ making the extended diagram commutative,
then $F(f)$ is a morphism between the corresponding vertices in $B$ extending $F\circ d$ to a commutative diagram.
Thus if we prove that there is no morphism extending $F\circ d$ then
there was no morphism extending $d$ in the first place. 
Therefore, the functorial method is very suitable to prove 
_negative_ existence for morphisms. Sometimes,
however, there is a theorem showing that some set of invariants
completely characterizes a problem hence being able to show
positive existence or uniqueness for maps or spaces.
For the uniqueness for morphisms, it is enough to show that $F$ is
faithful and that there is at most one solution for the existence
problem in the target category. 
Faithful functors in this context are rare, 
but it is sufficient for $F$ to be faithful on some subcategory $A_p$
of $A$ containing at least all morphisms which are 
the possible candidates for the solution of 
the particular existence problem for morphisms.

## Overview of methods

The archetypical example is the classification of [[surfaces]] via their [[Euler characteristic]]. But as this example already shows, algebraic topology tends to be less about [[topological spaces]] themselves as rather about the [[homotopy types]] which they [[homotopy hypothesis|present]]. Therefore the topological invariants in question
are typically homotopy invariants of spaces with some exceptions, like the [[shape theory|shape invariants]] for spaces with bad local behaviour.   

Hence modern algebraic topology is to a large extent the application of algebraic methods to [[homotopy theory]]. 

A general and powerful such method is the assignment of [[homology]] and [[cohomology]] [[groups]] to topological spaces, such that these [[abelian groups]] depend only on the [[homotopy type]]. The simplest such are [[ordinary homology]] and [[ordinary cohomology]] groups, given by [[singular simplicial complexes]]. This way algebraic topology makes use of tools of [[homological algebra]]. 

The [[axiom|axiomatization]] of the properties of such [[cohomology]] group assignments is what led to the formulation of the trinity of concepts of _[[category]]_, _[[functor]]_ and _[[natural transformations]]_, and algebraic topology has come to make intensive use of [[category theory]].

In particular this leads to the formulation of  [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] theories which detect more information about classes of homotopy types. By the [[Brown representability theorem]] such are represented by [[spectra]] (generalizing [[chain complexes]]), hence [[stable homotopy types]], and this way algebraic topology comes to use and be about [[stable homotopy theory]]. 

Still finer invariants of [[homotopy types]] are detected by further refinements of these "algebraic" structures, for instance to [[multiplicative cohomology theories]], to  [[equivariant homotopy theory]]/[[equivariant stable homotopy theory]] and so forth. The construction and analysis of these requires the intimate combination of algebra and homotopy theory to [[higher category theory]] and [[higher algebra]], notably embodied in the [[universal algebra|universal]] higher algebra of [[operads]].

The central tool for breaking down all this [[higher algebra|higher algebraic]] data into computable pieces are [[spectral sequences]], which are maybe the main heavy-lifting workhorses of algebraic topology.
