## Idea

_Algebraic topology_ refers to the application of methods of [[algebra]] to problems in [[topology]]. The archetypical example is the classification of [[surfaces]] via their [[Euler characteristic]]. But as this example already shows, algebraic topology tends to be less about [[topological spaces]] themselves as rather about the [[homotopy types]] which they [[homotopy hypothesis|present]]. Hence modern algebraic topologogy is to a large extent the application of algebraic methods to [[homotopy theory]].

A general and powerful such method is the assignment of [[homology]] and [[cohomology]] [[groups]] to topological spaces, such that these [[abelian groups]] depend only on the [[homotopy type]]. The simplest such are [[ordinary homology]] and [[ordinary cohomology]] groups, given by [[singular simplicial complexes]]. This way algebraic topology makes use of tools of [[homological algebra]]. 

The [[axiom|axiomatization]] of the properties of such [[cohomology]] group assignments is what led to the formulation of the trinity of concepts of _[[category]]_, _[[functor]]_ and _[[natural transformations]]_, and algebraic topology has come to make intensive use of [[category theory]].

In particular this leads to the formulation of  [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] theories which detect more information about classes of homotopy types. By the [[Brown representability theorem]] such are represented by [[spectra]] (generalizing [[chain complexes]]), hence [[stable homotopy types]], and this way algebraic topology comes to use and be about [[stable homotopy theory]]. 

Still finer invariants of [[homotopy types]] are detected by further refinements of these "algebraic" structures, for instance to [[multiplicative cohomology theories]], to  [[equivariant homotopy theory]]/[[equivariant stable homotopy theory]] and so forth. The construction and analysis of these requires the intimate combination of algebra and homotopy theory to [[higher category theory]] and [[higher algebra]], notably embodied in the [[universal algebra|universal]] higher algebra of [[operads]].

The central tool for breaking down all this [[higher algebra|higher algebraic]] data into computable pieces are [[spectral sequences]], which are maybe the main heavy-lifting workhorses of algebraic topology.
