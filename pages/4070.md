Beilinson and Drinfel'd were unhappy with non-illuminating definition of [[vertex operator algebra]] and invented a mathematical definition of version of chiral [[conformal field theory]] on an algebraic curve, under the name __chiral algebra__; their manuscript has being circulating from around 1995 as a long preprint and being more recently published by Amer. Math. Soc.
