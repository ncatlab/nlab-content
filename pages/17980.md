## Idea

In [[super-algebra|super]]-[[representation theory]], what is called _adinkras_ ([Faux-Gates 04](#FauxGates04)) is a graphical tool  for classifying certain [[super multiplets]] of the $N$-extended [[supersymmetry]] algebras in one dimension ([[supersymmetric quantum mechanics]] with $N$ supersymmetries). Later adinkras were realized to have relation to classification of [[super Riemann surfaces]] via [[dessins d'enfants]] ([Doran & Iga & Landweber & Mendez-Diez 13](#DoranIgaLandweberMendez-Diez13), [Doran & Iga & Kostiuk &Mendes-Diez 16](#DoranIgaKostiukMendes-Diez16)).

## Definition

For $N \in \mathbb{N}$, write

$$
  \mathbb{R}^{1 \vert N}
$$

for the [[super Lie algebra]] over the [[real numbers]] that is spanned by a single generator $P$ in even (i.e., bosonic) degree and $N$ generators $Q_I$, $I \in \{1, 2, \cdots, N\}$ in odd (i.e., fermionic) degree, whose only non-trivial components of the super [[Lie bracket]] is

$$
  [Q_I, Q_J]  = 2 \delta_{I J} P
  =
  \left\{
   \array{
      2 P & \vert \; I = J
      \\
      0 & \vert \; \text{otherwise}
   }
  \right.
$$

This is the 1-dimensional $N$-extended [[super translation super Lie algebra]]. We ay think of this as the super-translational symmetry of 1-dimensional $N$-extended [[super Minkowski spacetime]].

Consider then super [[Lie algebra representations]] of $\mathbb{R}^{1 \vert N}$ on [[super vector spaces]] of smooth [[superfields]] on $\mathbb{R}^{1 \vert N}$ (regarded as a [[supermanifold]]) and such that the bosonic generator $P$ acts as the [[derivative]] operator on [[smooth functions]] on $\mathbb{R}^1$ in each component. If in addition the representation is such that in the canonical [[linear basis]] the odd generators $Q_I$ send even/odd basis elements $\phi_i$ to single odd/even basis elements $\psi_j$ (as opposed to [[linear combinations]] of them), hence if the $Q_I$ act apart from degree-shift and possibly [[differentiation]] by [[permutations]] on the components of the [[superfields]], then this representation of $\mathbb{R}^{1\vert N}$ is called _adinkraic_. ([Zhang 13, p. 16](#Zhang13)).

The corresponding _adinkra_ is the [[bipartite graph]] which expresses these permutations:

## Classification

The topology of an adinkra graph together with its edge coloring in $\{1,2, \cdots, N\}$ is called its _chromotopology_.

The set of adinkra chromotopologies is equivalent to the set of colored $N$-cubs modulo doubly even length-$N$ [[linear codes]] ([Doran-Fauxg-Gates-Hubsch-Iga-Landweber-Miller 11](#DoranFauxgatesHubschIgaLandweberMiller11))


(A [[linear code]] of length $N$ is a [[linear subspace]] of $(\mathbb{F}_2)^N$ for $\mathbb{F}_2$ the [[prime field]] with two elements and it is _doubly even_ if every element has weight a multiple of 4. )
