## Idea 
 {#Idea}

In the current [[standard model of particle physics]] the [[fundamental particles]] in the three [[generations of fermions]] have identical properties from one generation to the next, except for their [[mass]], a state of affairs referred to as _[[lepton]] [[flavour physics|flavour]] universality_ (LFU). A possible violation of lepton flavour universality (LFUV) is also called a _[[flavour in particle physics|flavour]] anomaly_, which, if confirmed, would be a sign of "New Physics" (NP) beyond the [[standard model of particle physics|standard model]].

The presence -- or not -- of flavour anomalies is part of the general _[[flavour problem]]_ of the [[standard model of particle physics]].

Flavor universality pertains in particular to ([[semileptonic decay|semi]]-)[[leptonic decays]] of [[bottom quarks]], denoted $b$ (in the third [[generation of fundamental particles|generation]]), into [[electron]]/[[positron]] pairs, denoted $e^+ e^-$ (in the first [[generation of fundamental particles|generation]]) or [[muon]]/[[antiparticle|anti]][[muon]] pairs, denoted $\mu^+ \mu^-$ (in the second [[generation of fundamental particles|generation]]), the latter two jointly denoted $\ell^+ \ell^-$ (for "[[leptons]]") in this context.

Since [[quarks]] never appear in isolation (due to [[confinement]]) but always as [[bound states]] to [[hadrons]], [[scattering amplitude|decays]] specifically of [[bottom quarks]] manifest themselves in [[leptonic decays]] of [[mesons]] that contain $b$ -- [[B-mesons]], denoted $B$ --

\end{imagefromfile}

or as [[leptonic decays]] of [[baryons]] that contain $b$ -- [[Lambda baryons]], denoted $\Lambda_b$ (measured only more recently ([LHCb 19120.8139](#LHCb191208139))).

  },
  "caption": "from [Altmannshofer 14](flavor+problem#Altmannshofer14)" 
\end{imagefromfile}


Hence flavour universality in the [[standard model of particle physics]] demands, for example, that the _[[ratios]]_ of decay rates (branching fractions) of [[B-mesons]] into [[electrons]] are the same as into [[muons]], hence that the [[ratio]] 

\[
  \label{RKInIntroduction}
  R_K
  \;=\;
  \frac{ 
    B \to K \mu^+ \mu 
  }{
    B \to K e^+ e^-
  }
\]

(where $K$ is a [[kaon]], a [[meson]] containing a [[strange quark]])

is essentially equal to 1. Any [[statistical significance|significant]] departure of this [[observable]] from 1 would be a _flavour anomaly_ and would mean that there are fundamental processes at play which are not described by the current [[standard model of particle physics]] ("New Physics").


Moreover, in the [[standard model of particle physics|standard model]] the decays involved here are "forbidden" (have vanishing decay rate) at [[tree level]], so that only [[loop orders]] contribute to any possible flavour anomaly. But these loop contributions are sensitive to effects from putative undiscovered [[fundamental particles]] which "run in the loops" as [[virtual particles]], and which thus may show up as a flavour anomaly even if their [[mass]] is too large for them to be seen as scattering products (i.e. as actual, non-[[virtual particles]]). This way tests of lepton flavour universality provide a means to potentially detect New Physics with indirect high-luminosity/high-[[precision experiment]] (see e.g. [Brambilla et al. 14, Section 5](#Brambilla14) [AHRS 20](#AHRS20)), complementary to the traditional high-energy direct detection measurements.

Notice that the channel $R_K$ (eq:RKInIntroduction) is just one of many in which flavour anomalies may and have been seen. There are other decay channels of [[B-mesons]], and there are also flavour anomalies in decays of, for instance,  [[kaons]] ([Buras 16](kaon#Buras16), [Buras 18](kaon#Buras18)) as well as in angular observables ([LHCb 20](#LHCb2012)).

## Statistical significance
 {#StatisticalSignificance}

### Up to 2019

Indications of flavour anomalies have been observed consistently and with increasing [[statistical significance]] around $2.5-3$ [[standard deviations|σ]] in [[B meson]] [[scattering amplitude|processes]] in various decay channels and by a number of independent [[experiments]]: the [[LHCb experiment]], the [[Belle experiment]] and the [[BaBar experiment]]:

    "unit": "px"
  },
  "caption": "graphics grabbed from [Dey 18](#Dey18)" 
\end{imagefromfile}



{#GlobalSignificance} The global (all channels and experiments combined) tension  with the standard model by end of 2018 had [[statistical significance]] around $4.1$ [[standard deviations|σ]] ([Strumia et al. 17](#StrumiaEtAl17), [Cartelle 18, slide 22/25](#Cartelle18), [Dey 18, slide 16/23](#Dey18), [HAMN 18, p. 4](#HAMN18), [Bouchard-Cao-Owen 19](#BouchardCaoOwen19)). Various authors see the global tension (i.e. of all decay channels jointly) at over $5 \sigma$ ([CCDGMV 17](#CCDGMV17), [CFMVV 17](#CFMVV17) [CGMS 18](#CGMS18), [Dordei 18, slide 12](#Dordei18)), which traditionally qualifies as detection (see [here](statistical+significance#ParticlePhysics)), some authors already quote $5.3 \sigma - 5.8 \sigma$ ([ACDGMM 19](#ACDGMM19)) or $5-6 \sigma$ ([Kumar-London 19](#KumarLondon19), [Kumar 19](#Kumar19)). More recent measurements in March 2021 make even just the combination of the particularly "clean" observables reach $4\sigma - 4.6\sigma$, see [below](#SignificanceMarch2021) for more recent references.

### Updates in 2019

This situation was confirmed with the completed measurements presented at [Moriond 2019](http://moriond.in2p3.fr/2019/), which showed ([Straub 19](#Straub19), [Allanach 19](#Allanach19)) smaller mean discrepancy but also had smaller uncertainty, thus keeping the [[statistical significance]] of the apparent anomaly essentially unaffected. But [Caria 19, slide 9](#Caria19)  reported new measurements by [[Belle collaboration|Belle]] ([Belle 1910](#Belle1910))
according to which the previous [[statistical significance]] of $3.8 \sigma$ in the $R_D$ channel would decrease to $3.1 \sigma$ or $2.8 \sigma$ ([Gambino-Jung-Schacht 19 (6)](V_cb+puzzle#GambinoJungSchacht19)).  See [LHCb 19, p. 2](#LHCb19) for how the new numbers come about. The [[statistical significance]] over all sectors is still seen $\gt 4 \sigma$ ([London 19, p. 7](#London19)) or $\sim 3\sigma$ ([Jaiswal-Nandi-Patra 20](#JaiswalNandiPatra20)). Moreover, the theoretical prediction is being corrected further away from these measured values ([BDKL 20, footnote 1](#BDKL20)).

Comprehensive assessments of the situation after [Moriond 2019](http://moriond.in2p3.fr/2019/) are given in [AHMSN 19](#AHMSN19), [Descotes-Genon 19](#DescotesGenon19), [Bardhan-Ghosh 19](#BardhanGhosh19), [Alguero 19](#Alguero19) and agree that the flavour anomalies have been confirmed:

>  It appears the reason is that, given the amount of independent measurements (~180!) a smaller deviation because of new physics is easier to accommodate than a large one. Thus the new measurements actually fit better with new physics.

There is the claim ([DGKV 19](#DGKV19)) that the discrepancy with the standard model increases further if non-trivial [[hadron|hadronic]] [[form factors]] are taken into account:

> The set of $b \to s \ell \ell$ anomalies are alive and a global coherence remains after the measurements in 2019 and 2020. While some key measurements have central values that have moved towards the Standard Model predictions, the overall consistency of the data and the global tension with respect to the Standard Model has not diminished (in fact this may even enhance the significance for New Physics). The New Physics fit is a good fit (with $p$-values in the ballpark of 50%), and the SM pull is high $[$...$]$. In addition, data sets from all different experiments are compatible $[$...$]$.

### Updates in 2021

{#SignificanceMarch2021} New measurements reported by [[LHC]] [in March 2021](https://home.cern/news/news/physics/intriguing-new-result-lhcb-experiment-cern) for the first time see deviation in a single decay channel at a statistical significance above $3.1 \sigma$.

Implications for the significance across channels:

[HLN 21](#HLN21):

> Naive combination of $R_K$ and $R_{K*}$ measurements shows a deviation from the standard model above $4 \sigma$

[GGJLMCS 21](#GGJLMCS21):

> We find that the data on clean observables is a variance with the SM at a level of $4 \sigma$.  Furthermore, scenarios with pure left-handed or axial currents provide a better description of these data with a significance close to $5 \sigma$.

[AlSt 21](#AltmannshoferStangl21):

> With the recent updates $[...]$ the case for new physics inrare B decays has been further strengthened. $[...]$ Even if only the theoretically  clean  LFU observables  $[...]$ are considered, muon specific $[$ Wilson coefficients for New Physics$]$ im prove over the Standard Model by $\sqrt{\Delta^2} \simeq 4.7 \sigma$.

[CFFIN 21](#CFFIN21):

> With the recent result $[$ of [[LHCb]] $]$, for the first time a single observable affected by negligible theoretical uncertainties exhibits a deviation from the SM exceeding the $3 \sigma$ level.  Equally striking is the overall coherence of the picture that emerges, especially in $b \to s \ell^+ \ell^-$ −transitions.  As we shall show in this paper, combining all the $b \to s \ell^+ \ell^-$−observables in a very conservative way, the significance of the New Physics (NP) hypothesis formulated in 2014–2015 of a purely left-handed LFU-violating contact interaction has now reached a [[statistical significance|significance]] of $4.6 \sigma$.

> $[\ldots]$  A more structural way of addressing the flavor structure of the model is the idea of implementing [[GUT|Pati-Salam unification]]

[LIOS 21](#LIOS21):

> we obtain the global significance to be 3.9 standard deviations


[MT 21](#MarzoccaTrifinopoulos21):

> the combined significance of the deviation reaches $4.7\sigma$. Furthermore, taking into account also less theoretically-clean observables $[\ldots]$ the overall significance of the deviations  in  this  channel  is  raised  to  even  above  $6\sigma$, depending on the specific SM prediction employed

\linebreak

### Outlook

If the ongoing evaluation of the data of [[LHC]]'s Run 2 confirms the measurements of Run 1, then the [[statistical significance]] of the effect in each decay channel separately is expected to have reached 5 [[standard deviations|σ]] ([Crivellin et. al 18, p. 12](#CrivellinEtAl18), [Zupan 19, 4.6](#Zupan19)) -- in [HMSN 21](#HMSN21) this is expected for Run 3 data -- and hence conventionally count as detection of flavour anomaly (see [here](statistical+significance#ParticlePhysics)), which would make it the first established "new physics" seen at the [[LHC]]. Extrapolation based on [LHCb Collaboration 18](#LHCbCollaboration18) predicts a [[statistical significance]] between 6 and 10 $\sigma$ by the year 2025 ([LKLR 19, p. 12](#LKLR19)).

## Status and Outlook
 {#Outlook}

In conclusion, with currently available data, the observed flavour anomalies are possible signs of New Physics beyond the current [[standard model of particle physics]].

While the [[statistical significance]] of the [[flavour anomalies]] in every single decay channel is about $2\sigma -  3 \sigma$, the effects are all compatible with each other, with a high joint/global statistical significance:

> [Garisto 20](#Garisto20): Alone, each notable B physics result is only a few-sigma discrepancy. But taken together, the aggregate of the results is—depending on whom you ask—a 5- to 7-sigma deviation from the standard model estimates. 

> [[Gino Isidori|Isodori]]: "We’ve seen a lot of anomalies here and there popping up and going back, but this time I think it’s different… . For the first time, it’s not just one thing that doesn't fit with the other, but it's a coherent set of things."

[CFFIN 21](#CFFIN21): 

> striking is the overall coherence of the picture that emerges, especially in $b \to s \ell^+ \ell^-$ −transitions.  As we shall show in this paper, combining all the $b \to s \ell^+ \ell^-$−observables in a very conservative way, the significance of the New Physics (NP) hypothesis formulated in 2014–2015 of a purely left-handed LFU-violating contact interaction has now reached a [[statistical significance|significance]] of $4.6 \sigma$.


In any case, further and more sensitive experiments are needed to  confirm and explore the effect, such as possibly the "[HL-LHC](http://hilumilhc.web.cern.ch)" or "HE-LHC" experiment. General outlook, prospects and suggestions for future collider design in this respect are discussed in detail in [Allanach-Gripaios-You 17](#AllanachGripaiosYou17), [Crivellin et al.  18](#CrivellinEtAl18).

Outlook on the [[Belle II experiement]] to confirm the flavour anomalies, if real ([HHJLQV 20](#HHJLQV20)):

> With $[$ ... $]$ [[Belle II]], we are at the brink of a new era in [[quark]] [[flavour physics]] $[...]$ we present a phenomenological study of  the potential for [[Belle II]] to reveal possible new physics in the inclusive decay channel

> ([p. 15](#HHJLQV20):) We see that [[flavour anomalies|anomalies]] in the exclusive sector can be confirmed at the [[statistical significance|5σ]] level by inclusive measurements if the true values of $C_{9,10}^{\mu NP}$ are at the current best-fit point of the exclusive fits

> ([p. 16](#HHJLQV20):)  After including $B_s \to \mu^+ \mu_-$, the reach in the $[C_9^{\mu NP}, C_{10}^{\mu NP}]$ plane improves considerably.  Exclusive [[flavour anomalies|anomalies]] could be confirmed at the [[statistical significance|6σ]] level.

> ([p. 20](#HHJLQV20):) Should  the  true  value  of $C_9^{NP}$ and $C_{10}^{NP}$ be at  the current best-fit points of the global fits, an analysis of inclusive $\bar B_ \to X_s \ell^+ \ell^-$ at [[Belle II]] with $50 ab^{-1}$ of data will exclude the SM point $C_9^{NP} = C_{10}^{NP} = 0$ at the level of $\sim 5$[[statistical significance|σ]].  This again underlines the necessity of a full angular analysis of $\bar B_ \to X_s \ell^+ \ell^-$ at [[Belle II]].



## Relation to other anomalies
 {#RelationToOtherAnomalies}

There is possibly a relation between the [[flavour anomalies]] and the  [anomalies](anomalous+magnetic+moment#Anomalies) observed in the [[anomalous magnetic moment]] of the [[electron]] and/or the [[muon]] (e.g. [Chiang-Okada 17](#ChiangOkada17)) which might point to a common origin of these anomalies in the [[flavour sector]] (e.g. [Crivellin-Hoferichter 20](#CrivellinHoferichter20)):

> (here "$R$" refers to [[flavour anomalies]] in various channels, "$a$" refers to anomalies in the the [[anomalous magnetic moments]] of the [[electron]] and the [[muon]], "LFUV" is shoft for "Lepton Flavor Universality Violation", and the numbers are the [[statistical significances]] of the effects seen)



Indeed, [[leptoquark]] models preferred by the flavour anomalies (see [below](#Leptoquarks)) are also a candidate explanation of the anomaly seen at over 4$\sigma$ [[statistical significance]] in the [[anomalous magnetic moment]] of the [[muon]], see [there](anomalous+magnetic+moment#Anomalies).

Some authors therefore begin to speak jointly of _muon anomalies_ ([GST 21](#GST21)).

\linebreak

## Possible models

Candidate [[model (in theoretical physics)|models]] of "New Physics" beyond the [[standard model of particle physics]] that could possibly explain the flavour anomalies (if indeed they are real) includes the following:


### Leptoquarks and Grand unified theory
 {#Leptoquarks}

One promising [[model (in theoretical physics)|model]] that could potentially explain the apparently observed flavour anomalies are
[[leptoquarks]], which naturally arise in, and hence potentially point to, [[grand unified theory]] [[model (in theoretical physics)|models]], such as notably the [[Pati-Salam model]] ([Heek-Teresi 18](#HeekTeresi18), [Heek-Teresi 19](#HeekTeresi19))

(see [Bauer-Neubert 15](#BauerNeubert15), [CCDM 16](#CCDM16), [Crivellin 17](#Crivellin17), [Falkowski17](#Falkowski17), [Mueller 18](#Mueller18), [Matsuzaki-Nishiwaki 18](#MatsuzakiNishiwaki18), [Monteux-Rajaraman 18](#MonteuxRajaraman18), [AMST 18](#AMST18), [BDFKFS 18](#BDFKFS18), [Crivellin 18](#Crivellin18), [MMR 18](#MMR18), [Kumar-London 19, section 2.2.1](#KumarLondon19), [MVT 19](#MVT19), [AMM 19](#AMM19), [MVK 19](#MVK19), [Cata-Mannel 19](#CataMannel19))


From [Crivellin 18, p. 2](#Crivellin18):

> the global fit $[$ to [[flavour anomalies]] $]$ even shows compelling evidence for New Physics $[$... $]$ The vector [[leptoquark]] (LQ) $SU(2)_L$ singlet with hypercharge $-4/3$ arising in the famous [[Pati-Salam model]] is capable of explaining all the $[$[[flavour anomalies|flavour]] $]$ anomalies and therefore several attempts to construct a [[UV completion]] for this LQ to address the anomalies have been made. It can give a sizeable effect in $b \to c(u)\tau \nu$ data without violating bounds from $b \to s(d)\nu \bar \nu$ and/or direct searches, provides (at [[tree level]]) a $C_9 = - C_{10}$ solution to $b \to s \ell^+ \ell^-$ data and does not lead to [[proton decay]] at any order in [[perturbative quantum field theory|perturbation theory]].

In [CFFPV20](#CFFPV20):

> In the Standard Model Effective Theory (SMEFT) [41, 42], the significance of NewPhysics from the global $b \to s \ell^+ \ell^-$ analysis increases with the inclusion of new data, reaching a maximum of almost 6σ for the simple hypothesis of a non-vanishing $[$[[leptoquark]] contribution$]$.
