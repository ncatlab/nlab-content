
Let $C$ be some [[category]] of [[modules]] or [[bimodules]] (say over a [[ring]], algebra, or operator algebra). Then an [[subobject]] $M\subset N$ is an __essential submodule__ of $N$ (or, we say that $N$ is an __essential extension__ of $M$) if $M$ has nonzero intersection ([[pullback]] in more abstract situations) with any nonzero subobject of $N$ (or equivalently, $M$ has zero intersection with only the [[zero subobject]] of $N$).

In particular, one applies this terminology to [[ideals]], i.e. submodules (or subbimodules in the $2$-sided case) of a ring, algebra, or operator algebra itself. Hence we talk about __essential ideals__. For essential extensions, one considers [[extensions]] of algebras, where 'essential' still refers to non-intersection with submodules rather than with [[subalgebras]].
