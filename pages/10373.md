Let $C$ be some category of modules or bimodules (say over a ring, algebra, operator algebra). Then an object $M\subset N$ is an __essential submodule__ of $N$ (or, we say that $N$ is an essential extension of $M$) if $M$ has nonzero intersection (pullback in more abstract situations) with any nonzero subobject of $N$. 

In particular, one applies this terminology to ideals, i.e. submodules (or in 2-sided case subbimodules) of a ring, algebra or operator algebra itself. Hence we talk about __essential ideals__. In the case of extensions, one can consider extensions of algebras, where essential still refers to non-intersection with submodules rather than subalgebras.
