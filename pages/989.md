## Definitions

For $R$ a [[commutative ring]], an **associative unital $R$-algebra** 
is equivalently 

* a [[monoid]] [[internalization|internal to]] $R$[[Mod]] equipped with the [[tensor product of modules]] $\otimes$;

* a [[pointed object|pointed]] one-object category [[enriched category|enriched over]] $(R Mod, \otimes)$;

* a pointed $R$-[[algebroid]] with one object;

* an  $R$-[[module]] $V$ equipped with [[linear maps]] $p : V \otimes V \to V$ and $i : k \to V$ satisfying the associative and unit laws;

* a [[ring]] $A$ [[under category|under]] $R$.

If there is no danger for confusion, one often says simply 'associative algebra', or even only '[[algebra]]'.

More generally, a (merely) **associative algebra** need not have $i: R \to V$; that is, it is a [[semigroup]] instead of a monoid.

Less generally, a **[[commutative algebra]]** (where associative and unital are usually assumed) is an [[abelian monoid]] in $Vect$.


## Variants

* A [[cosimplicial algebra]] is a [[cosimplicial object]] in the category of algebras.

* A [[dg-algebra]] is a [[monoid]] not in [[Vect]] but in the category of (co)[[chain complex]]es.

* A [[smooth algebra]] is an associative $\mathbb{R}$-algebra that has not only the usual binary product induced from the product $\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, but has a $n$-ary product operation for every [[smooth function]] $\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$.

  This may be understood as a special case of an [[algebra over a Lawvere theory]], here the [[Lawvere theory]] [[CartSp]].
