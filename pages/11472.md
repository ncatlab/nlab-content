## Idea

It is a common experience in [[mathematics]] that phenomena ("problems") are usefully decomposed into a "local" and a "global" aspect of rather different nature.

In as far as the situation has an interpretation in [[geometry]] then the local aspect is typically given by the [[formal neighbourhoods]] of all [[points]], while the global aspect is given by the underlying [[topology]]/[[homotopy type]]. The following provides some examples.

### In number theory and algebraic geometry

In [[number theory]] and hence in [[algebraic geometry]] over $Spec(\mathbb{Z})$, the "local" situation is the [[formal neighbourhoods]] of all [[primes]] $p$ (points in the [[prime spectrum]] $Spec(\mathbb{Z})$ of the [[integers]]). These are the [[formal spectra]] of the [[p-adic integers]]. In terms of [[number theory]] this means that a solution to a [[polynomial]] [[equation]] over the [[p-adic integers]] is a "local" approximation to a solution over the [[integers]] (the former is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the latter to exist). In this form the _local-global principle_ is attributed to [[Helmut Hasse]] and also called the **Hasse principle** or similar.

### In conformal field theory


The [[FRS-theorem]] shows that every [[rational 2d CFT]] is decomposed into local data given by a [[vertex operator algebra]] and global data given by a solution of the [[sewing constraints]]...
