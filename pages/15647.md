## Idea

For a suitable [[linear operator]] (say on [[section]] of a [[line bundle]] over a [[Riemann surface]]), its _zeta function_ is the [[sum]] of the $-s$-powers of all its [[eigenvalues]], as a function of $s$. This is analogous to the _[[Riemann zeta function]]_ and the [[Dedekind zeta function]] (or would be if there were something like a [[Laplace operator]] on [[Spec(Z)]]).

## Definition

Given an [[elliptic differential operator]] with positive lower bound $c$,  write $D$ for its [[self-adjoint extension]] and write 

$$
  0 \lt \lambda_1 \leq \lambda_2 \leq \cdots
$$

for its [[eigenvalues]].

Then the _zeta function_ of $D$ is

$$
  \zeta_D(s) \coloneqq \underoverset{n = 1}{\infty}{\sum} \frac{1}{(\lambda_n)^s}
  \,.
$$
