# Idea 

A _fixed point operator_ in a [[cartesian monoidal category]], or more generally a [[cartesian multicategory]] is a structure on a category that models that every object of the category has the [[fixed point property]], i.e., every endomorphism in the category has a [[fixed point]].

In [[denotational semantics]] of programming languages, these can be used to model [[recursive]] definitions.

# Definition

There are several equivalent formulations in the literature, here we present the definition that is most useful (parameterized) and general (multicategorical): a _parameterized_ fixed point operator in a [[cartesian multicategory]].

A parameterized fixed point operator on a cartesian multicategory $M$ is a family of functions $fix : M(\Gamma,X;X) \to M(\Gamma;X)$ satisfying:

1. (Naturality in $\Gamma$) For any substitution $\gamma : M(\Delta,\Gamma)$, $fix(f) \circ \gamma = fix(f \circ \gamma)$
2. (Dinaturality in $X$) For any $f : M(\Gamma, X;Y)$ and $g : M(\Gamma,Y;X)$, $fix(f \circ g) = f \circ fix(g \circ f)$
3. (Diagonal property) For any $f : M(\Gamma, X, X; X)$, $fix(fix(f)) = fix(f \circ (\gamma, x,x))$ where here the substitution $(\gamma, x,x) : M(\Gamma,X;\Gamma,X,X)$ duplicates the input.

Note that picking $g$ to be the identity in (2) implies the fixed point property: for any $f \in M(\Gamma,X;X)$, $f \circ fix(f) = fix(f)$.

# Related Concepts

A parameterized fixed-point operator is equivalent to a [[traced monoidal category|trace]] structure on a [[cartesian monoidal category]].

When the [[cartesian multicategory]] is regarded as an [[algebraic theory]], a fixed-point operator is the same thing as the structure of an [[iteration theory]].
