## Idea

+-- {: .standout}

**Cyclic cohomology** is the $S^1$-[[equivariant cohomology]] refinement of [[Hochschild cohomology]]: the [[cohomology]] $H_{S^1}(\mathcal{L}X,A)$ of [[free loop space object]]s equivariant under the natural circle action on $\mathcal{L}X.$ 

=--

Hochschild cohomology on $X$ -- the cohomology of $\mathcal{L}X$ --  realizes (analogs of) [[differential form]]s on $X$. The circle action on $\mathcal{L}X$ induces a [[differential]] on these forms. The $S^1$-invariant part of the cohomology is therefore given by (the analog of) _closed_ differential forms.
