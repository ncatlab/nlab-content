## Idea

What are called _advanced_ and _retarded propagators_ $\Delta_{A/R}$ are the [[Green functions]] for the [[wave operator]]/[[Klein-Gordon operator]] (hence "[[propagators]]") on a [[globally hyperbolic spacetime]] $(X,e)$ characterized by the fact that their [[support of a distribution|support]] as [[distributions]]

$$
  \Delta_{A/R}
  \in \mathcal{D}'(X \times X)
$$

is such that 

1. $(x,y) \in supp(\Delta_R)$ precisely if $x$ is in the [[causal future]] of $y$;

1. $(x,y) \in supp(\Delta_A)$ precisely if $x$ is in the [[causal past]] of $y$.
