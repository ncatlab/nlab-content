## Idea

What are called _advanced_ and _retarded propagators_ $\Delta_{A/R}$ are the [[Green functions]] for the [[wave operator]]/[[Klein-Gordon operator]] (hence "[[propagators]]") on a [[globally hyperbolic spacetime]] $(X,e)$ characterized by the fact that their [[support of a distribution|support]] as [[distributions]]

$$
  \Delta_{A/R}
  \in \mathcal{D}'(X \times X)
$$

is such that 

1. $(x,y) \in supp(\Delta_R)$ precisely if $x$ is in the [[causal future]] of $y$;

1. $(x,y) \in supp(\Delta_A)$ precisely if $x$ is in the [[causal past]] of $y$.

Written as [[generalized functions]] these satisfy

$$
  \Delta_A(x,y) = \Delta_R(y,x)
  \,.
$$

This implies in particular that 

1. the _[[causal propagator]]_, which is the difference of the two

   $$
     \Delta_S \coloneqq \Delta_R - \Delta_A
   $$

   is skew-symmetric in its arguments (reflecting the fact that this is the [[integral kernel]] for the [[Peierls-Poisson bracket]] for the [[free field|free]] [[scalar field]] on the given spacetime);

1. the _[[Dirac propagator]]_, which is the sum of the two

   $$
     \Delta_D \coloneqq \Delta_R + \Delta_A
   $$

   is symmetric in its arguments, reflecting the fact that this is the integral kernel for [[time-ordered products]] away from the [[diagonal]].
