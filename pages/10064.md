## Idea

An _iterated integral_ is a expression involving nested [[integrals]], such as
$$ \int_{x=a}^b \bigg(\int_{y=g(x)}^{h(x)} f(x,y) \,\mathrm{d}y\bigg) \,\mathrm{d}x ,$$
where the grouping parentheses are usually left out.  Iterated integrals are the subject of [[Fubini theorem]]s.

Iterated integrals include nested [[integration of differential forms]] of the kind as it appears in the formulation of [[parallel transport]] for nonabelian-value [[connection on a bundle|connection]] form.

Applied to higher degree forms iterated integrals serve to express generalized [[transgression]] of differential forms to [[loop spaces]] and other [[mapping spaces]] relaized as [[diffeological spaces]].


## References

The notion of iterated integration of differential forms originates in informal observation like the [[Dyson formula]] for [[parallel transport]]. It was formalized in the context of [[differential geometry]] on [[diffeological spaces]] ([[Chen spaces]]) (especially [[loop spaces]]) in
