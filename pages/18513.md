## Idea

The [[Moyal deformation quantization]] of a [[local field theory|local]] [[free field theory]] is an [[associative algebra]] which generalizes the construction that in [[physics]] is traditionally known as the product of _normal ordered operators_ via _[[Wick's lemma]]_. Therefore these algebras are sometimes called _Wick algebras_.

That these algebras are indeed the [[Moyal deformation quantization]] of [[free field theory]] is due to ([Dito 90](#Dito90)) and was amplified in the context of [[locally covariant perturbative quantum field theory]] in ([Dütsch-Fredenhagen 01](#DutschFredenhagen01)).
