## Idea

A _Wick algebra_ is an [[operator algebra]] of [[free fields|free]] [[quantum field theory|quantum fields]].

In the [[quantum mechanics]] of [[harmonic oscillators]] or in [[quantum field theory]] of [[free fields]] on [[Minkowski spacetime]] one encounters [[linear operators]] $\{a_k, a^\ast_k\}_{k \in K}$ that satisfy the [[canonical commutation relation]] $[a_i, a^\ast_j] = diag((c_k))_{i j}$.
Then by a _normal ordered polynomial_ or _Wick polynomial_ ([Wick 50](#Wick50)) one means a [[polynomial]], denoted $:P:$, which is obtained from a polynomial $P((a_k, a^\ast_k))$  by ordering all "creation operators" $a_k^\ast$ to the left of all "annihiliation operators". For example

$$
  \array{
    :a^\ast: = a^\ast
    \\
    :a: = a
    \\
    :a^\ast a: = a^\ast a
    \\
    :a a^\ast: = a^\ast a
    \\
    :a a^\ast a: = a^\ast a a 
  }
  \,.
$$

The product of two Wick polynomials, computed in the ambient operator algebra and then re-expressed as a Wick polynomial, is given by [[Wick's lemma]], for example

$$
  {:a^\ast a:} \, {:a^\ast a:} 
  =
  :a^\ast a^\ast a a: + c \, :a^\ast a:
  \,,
$$

where $c \coloneqq [a, a^\ast]$ is the value of the canonical [[commutator]].

The [[associative algebra]] thus obtained is hence called the _algebra of normal ordered operators_ or _Wick polynomial algebra_ or just _Wick algebra_. 

This plays a central role in [[perturbative quantum field theory]], where the [[quantization]] of [[free fields]] is traditionally _defined_ as the corresponding Wick algebra. 

But in fact the Wick algebra in [[quantum field theory]] may be understood more systematically as being the [[Moyal deformation quantization]] of the canonical [[Poisson bracket]] on the [[covariant phase space]] of the [[free field]], which is the [[Peierls bracket]] modified to an [[almost Kähler structure]] by the [[2-point function]] of a [[quasi-free Hadamard state]] ([Dito 90](#Dito90), [Dütsch-Fredenhagen 01](#DutschFredenhagen01)). Understood in this form the construction generalized to [[quantum field theory on curved spacetimes]] ([Brunetti-Fredenhagen 95](#BrunettiFredenhagen95), [Brunetti-Fredenhagen 00](#BrunettiFredenhagen00), [Hollands-Wald 01](#HollandsWald01)).

Finally the shift by the [[quasi-free Hadamard state]], which is the very source of the "normal ordering" was understood as an example of the almost-Kähler version of the quantization recipe of [[Fedosov deformation quantization]] ([Collini 16](#Collini16)).
