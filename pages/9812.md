Let $S$ be a [[scheme]].  The **proper topology** is a [[Grothendieck topology]] on the [[full subcategory]] of [[proper morphism]]s in $Sch/S$ (the category of schemes over $S$).  Namely, it is the topology generated by the [[pretopology]] where covering families are single-element families $\{ p : Y \to X \}$ with $p$ proper and [[surjective]].
