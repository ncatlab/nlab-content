## Idea

The traditional definition of a [[Dirac operator]] is formulated for operators acting on [[sections]] of [[spinor bundles]] over [[Riemannian manifolds]], not however directly for bundles over [[infinite dimensional manifolds]].

When the conceptual importance of the [[Dirac-Ramond operator]] in the [[superstring]] [[worldsheet]] [[2d SCFT]] was realized (an operator in a ([[sheaf of vertex operator algebras|sheaf of]]) [[super vertex operator algebra]]) via the relation in the [[large volume limit]] of its [[index]] (suitably regarded) to the [[Witten genus]], then it seemed suggestive that it should be possible to regard the Dirac-Ramond operator as an actual Dirac operator on the infinite-dimensional [[smooth loop space]] of the underlying manifold, and regard its $S^1$-equivariant [[index of a Dirac operator]] in some precise sense.

The definition of Dirac operators on smooth loop spaces is technically tricky, but constructions do exist. It remains however unclear how these constructions relate to the [[Dirac-Ramond operator]] and a rigorous derivation of the [[Witten genus]] as an (equivariant) [[index of a Dirac operator]] along these lines seems to remain open.
