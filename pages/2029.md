
## Definition

An algebraic [[scheme]] is __reduced__ if all stalks of the structure sheaf are [[local rings]] without nonzero nilpotent elements. 

This means that it is a [[reduced object]] in the sense of [[synthetic differential geometry]].

Equivalently a scheme $X$ is reduced iff it can be covered by a family $\{U_\alpha\}_\alpha$ of open sets such that $\mathcal{O}_X(U)$ has no nonzero nilpotent elements. Equivalently, every open $U\subset X$ has the property that $\mathcal{O}_X(U)$ has no nonzero nilpotent elements.
