An algebraic [[scheme]] is __reduced__ if all stalks of the structure sheaf are [[local rings]] without nonzero nilpotent elements. 

This means that it is a [[reduced object]] in the sense of [[synthetic differential geometry]].

Equivalently a scheme $X$ is reduced iff it can be covered by a family $\{U_\alpha\}_\alpha$ of open sets such that $\mathcal{O}_X(U)$ has no nonzero nilpotent elements. Equivalently, every open $U\subset X$ has the property that $\mathcal{O}_X(U)$ has no nonzero nilpotent elements.

Reducedness can also be characterized by the [[internal language]] of the sheaf topos $\mathrm{Sh}(X)$: $X$ is reduced iff $\mathcal{O}_X$ is a reduced ring in $\mathrm{Sh}(X)$ iff $\mathcal{O}_X$ is a [[field|residue field]] in $\mathrm{Sh}(X)$ (i.e. every non-unit is zero). This can be used to give an internal proof of the fact that $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules of [[coherent sheaf|finite type]] over a reduced scheme are locally free iff their rank is constant (by internalizing the constructive proof of the linear algebra fact that finitely generated modules over residue fields are free, provided the minimal number of elements needed to generate the module exists as a natural number).
