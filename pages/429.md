## Idea

Universal algebra is the study of [[algebraic theories]] and their models or algebras.  Whereas abstract algebra studies groups, rings, modules and so on --- that is, models of particular theories --- universal algebra is about algebraic or __equational__ theories in general.

Traditionally, the subject studies models of algebraic theories in the [[category]] of [[Set|sets]].  The category-theoretic approach abstracts the traditional notions, to study models in more general categories.  There are two ways of doing this: by using [[monads]] and by using [[Lawvere theories]].

As with the category-theoretic understanding of many other branches of mathematics, the advantage of doing things this way is not so much the obtaining of new results as the __unification__ of many previously disparate points of view.  Examples might include how a [[Hopf algebra]] is the same thing as a model in a category of vector spaces of the theory of groups, or how computational side-effects in the theory of programming languages may be understood in terms of [[free algebras]].
