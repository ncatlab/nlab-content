Higher noncommutative geometry refers to the version of [[higher geometry]] where the spaces are locally in some sense represented by [[higher algebra]]s without commutativity constraints, or by higher categories of [[quasicoherent sheaves]]. 

The standard case is the [[derived noncommutative geometry]] where spaces are represented by nice $A_\infty$-categories or by [[spectral categories]].
