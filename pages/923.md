##Idea ##
In 1959. Edgar Brown introduced twisted tensor product to give an algebraic description of a fibration. The chain complex of a total space of a principal fibration is obtained as a small perturbation (at the level of differential) of the chain complex of the trivial fibration (hence a tensor product). 

##Definition##
Let $C$ be a dg-algebra, $A$ a dg-coalgebra, $\tau:C\to A$ the [[twisting cochain|twisting cochain]], $L$ a right $C$-dg-comodule with coaction $\delta_L:L\otimes C$ and $M$ a left $A$-dg-module with action $m_M:M\otimes A\to A$. The twisted tensor product $L\otimes_\tau M$ is the chain complex coincides with the ordinary tensor product $L\otimes M$ as graded module over the ground ring, and whose differential $d_\tau$ is given by 
$$
d_\tau = d_L\otimes 1 + 1\otimes d_M + (1\otimes m_M)\circ(1\otimes\tau\otimes 1)\circ(\delta_L\otimes 1).
