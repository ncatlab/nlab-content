## Idea

The measurable subsets of a [[measure space]] $(X,\mu)$ are those [[subsets]] $A$ of the [[underlying set]] $X$ for which the measure $\mu(A)$ is defined (at all, even possibly as infinite).  Intuitively, one might expect every subset of $X$ to be measurable, and this is the case in some examples, but in the standard example of [[Lebesgue measure]] on the [[real line]], this is incompatible with the [[axiom of choice]].  (On the other hand, in [[dream mathematics]], where the full axiom of choice fails, every subset of the real line *is* Lebesgue measurable.)

Regardless, every subset $A$ of $X$ has both an [[outer measure]] $\mu^*(A)$ and an [[inner measure]] $\mu_*(A)$.
