A __cocartesian monoidal category__ is a [[monoidal category]] whose monoidal product is a [[coproduct]] (and so whose unit is an [[initial object]]).  It is the [[opposite category|dual]] of a [[cartesian monoidal category]].

Sometime we refer to a category as __cocartesian monoidal__ just to indicate that it *has* all finitary coproducts.
