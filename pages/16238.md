## Idea

This entry is about the notion of [[module]] or [[quasi-coherent sheaf|quasi-coherent]] [[chain complex|complexes]] in the setting of [[higher geometry]] and more specifically, [[E-infinity geometry]] and [[derived algebraic geometry]].

In this setting, modules are already derived, in the sense that modules over an ordinary [[scheme]] or [[stack]], viewed as a discrete [[derived scheme]] or [[derived stack]], are [[complexes]] of [[quasi-coherent sheaves]].

## Definition

Let $Sch^{aff}$ and $Stk$ denote the [[(infinity,1)-categories]] of affine [[derived schemes]] and [[derived stacks]], respectively.
Consider the [[(infinity,1)-prestack]] of [[stable (infinity,1)-categories]]
  $$ Mod : (Sch^{aff})^{op} \to Cat^{stab}_\infty $$
which associates to a [[commutative ring spectrum]] $A$ the [[stable (infinity,1)-category]] $Mod(A)$.

By taking the [[right Kan extension]] of this prestack along the ([[opposite (infinity,1)-category|opposite]] of the) [[Yoneda embedding]]
  $$ (Sch^{aff})^{op} \hookrightarrow Stk^{op}, $$
one gets an [[(infinity,1)-prestack]]
  $$ Mod : Stk^{op} \to Cat^{stab}_\infty. $$
In other words, for a derived stack $X$, $Mod(X)$ is given by the [[limit in an (infinity,1)-category|limit]]
  $$ Mod(X) = lim_{Spec(A) \to X} Mod(A). $$

## In ordinary algebraic geometry

In the case of ordinary [[affine schemes]], [[modules]] in this sense, i.e. [[modules]] over [[Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectra]], correspond by the [[stable Dold-Kan correspondence]] to [[chain complexes]].  The corresponding notion of module over an ordinary [[scheme]] or [[stack]] is then a _quasi-coherent complex_.
That is, for a [[commutative ring]] $A$,
  $$ Mod(H A) = D(Mod(A)) $$
(the [[derived category]] of [[chain complexes]] of $A$-[[modules]]), and for a classical [[scheme]] $X$,
  $$ Mod(X) = D(QCoh(A)) $$
(the [[derived category]] of [[chain complexes]] of [[quasi-coherent sheaves]]).

## Properties

The [[(infinity,1)-prestack]] $Mod$ satisfies [[Zariski descent]] and even [[Nisnevich descent]]; this is due to [[Jacob Lurie]] and [[Vladimir Drinfeld]].

$Mod$ lifts to a prestack of [[symmetric monoidal (infinity,1)-categories]].  The [[dualizable objects]] are precisely the [[perfect modules]].
In good cases, the [[stable (infinity,1)-category]] $Mod(X)$ is [[compactly generated (infinity,1)-category|compactly generated]] and the [[compact objects]] are precisely the [[perfect modules]].
