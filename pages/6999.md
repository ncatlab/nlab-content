## Definition

For $\Gamma : \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{B}$ a [[functor]] we say that it _has [[codiscrete object]]s_ if it has a  [[full and faithful functor|full and faithful]] [[right adjoint]] $coDisc : \mathcal{B} \hookrightarrow \mathcal{E}$. 

This is for instance the case for the [[global section]] [[geometric morphism]] of a [[local topos]] $ (Disc \dashv \Gamma \dashv coDisc) \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{B}$. 

In this situation, we say that a  **concrete object** $X \in \mathcal{E}$ is one for which the $(\Gamma \dashv coDisc)$-[[unit of an adjunction]] is a [[monomorphism]].

If $\mathcal{E}$ is a [[sheaf topos]], this is called a [[concrete sheaf]].

If $\mathcal{E}$ is a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] then this is called a [[concrete (∞,1)-sheaf]] or the like.

The dual notion is that of a [[co-concrete object]].

## Properties

$\Gamma$ is a [[faithful functor]] on [[morphisms]] whose [[codomain]] is concrete.
