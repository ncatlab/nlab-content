## Idea

Given a local [[action functional]] 

$$
  \exp(i S) : C \to U(1)
$$

on some [[configuration space]] $C$, BRST-BV formalism provides a construction of a [[symplectic manifold|symplectic]] [[reduced phase space]] $P := (C_{\{d S = 0\}})_{red}$ suitable for [[quantization]] ([[deformation quantization]], [[geometric quantization]]) in the context of [[derived geometry|derived]] [[dg-geometry]].

Notice that if $S$ is a <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/action+functional#LocalActionFunctional">local action functional</a> (is the [[integral]] $S(\phi) = \int_X L(\phi, \dot \phi, \cdots)$ over a [[Lagrangian]] $L$  on the [[jet space]] of some bundle over [[spacetime]] $X$) then the [[covariant phase space]] $C_{\{d S = 0\}}$ (the [[critical locus]]) of $S$ is canonically equipped with [[presymplectic structure]]. The [[quotient]] of $C$ by the [[action]] of the flow of those [[vector field]]s on which the presymplectic form is degenerate -- the [[gauge transformation]]s of the action functional -- is the [[reduced phase space]] $C_{\{d S = 0\}}_{red}$ which is genuinely [[symplectic manifold|symplectic]], and whose [[deformation quantization]] or [[geometric quantization]] is the desired quantization of $S$.

But $C_{\{d S = 0\}}_{red}$ may either not even exist as a suitable geometric space, and even if it doexist es it is in generally intractable in practice. The BRST-BV construction guarantees the existence of a tractable presentation of $(C_{\{d S = 0\}})_{red}$ in the context of [[derived geometry|derived]] [[dg-geometry]]:

it is constructed as the [[Isbell duality|formal dual]] of a graded-commutative [[dg-algebra]] called the _BRST-BV complex_ $C^\infty(P_{BV})$ , equipped with the structure of a differential-graded [[Poisson algebra]]

$$
  \{-,-\} : C^\infty(P_{BV}) \otimes C^\infty(P_{BV}) \to 
   C^\infty(P_{BV})
   \,.
$$

One distinguishes two somewhat different constructions 

* **Lagrangian BV formalism** (or "field-antifield formalism") constructs the [[phase space]] starting from an [[action functional]] $S$ by restricting homologically to the locus where $d S = 0$ and then weakly dividing out [[gauge group]] actions;


* **Hamiltonian BFV formalism** implements a homological version of [[symplectic reduction]].


In either case  _BRST-BV_ complex $C^\infty(P^{BV})$ is a model in [[dg-geometry]] of a joint [[homotopy theory|homotopical]] [[quotient]] and [[intersection]], hence of an [[(∞,1)-colimit]] and [[(∞,1)-limit]], of  a [[space]] in [[higher geometry]]/[[derived geometry]], in the presence of or induced by [[Poisson structure]].

Accordingly, the BRST-BV complex is built from two main pieces:

1. it contains in positive degree a [[BRST-complex]]: the [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] of the [[∞-Lie algebroid]] which is the homotopy [[quotient]] ([[action Lie algebroid]]) of the [[gauge group]] (in Lagrangian BV) or of the group of flows generated by the constraintts (in Hamiltonian BFV) -- which is in general an [[∞-group]] in either case -- acting on configuration space $C$;

* it contains in negative degree a [[Koszul-Tate resolution]] of the [[critical locus]] of the [[action functional]] (for Lagrangian BV) or of the constraint surface (in Hamiltonian BFV).




## Hamiltonian BFV
 {#HamiltonianBV}

### Homotopical Poisson reduction
  {#PoissonReduction}

The following is a rough survey of homotopical Poisson reduction, following ([Stasheff 96](#Stasheff96)).

Let $(X, \{-,-\})$ be a [[smooth manifold|smooth]] [[Poisson manifold]]. 

Let $A := C^\infty(X)$ be its [[associative algebra|algebra]] of [[smooth function]]s. 

Consider 

* an [[ideal]] $I \subset A$

* that is closed under the Poisson bracket

  $\{I,I\} \subset I$

  (one says we have _first class constraint_ or that 0-locus of $I$ is _coisotropic_)

By the Poisson bracket $I$ acts on $A$. The **Poisson reduction** of $X$ by $I$ is the combined

1. passage to the 0-locus of $I$, which algebraically (dually) is passage to the quotient algebra $A/I$;

1. passage to the quotient of $X$ by the $I$-actioni, which dually is the passage to the invariant subalgebra $A^I$.

This may be achieve in different orders:

The **Sniatycky-Weinstein reduction is the object

$$
  A_{SW} := (A/I)^I
  \,.
$$


The **Dirac reduction** is

$$
  A_{Dirac} := N(I)/I
$$

where $N(I) = \{f \in A | \{f, I\} \subset I\}$ is the "subalgebra of [[observable]]s".

**Proposition** These two algebras are [[isomorphic]]

$$
  A_{red} := A_{SW} \simeq A_{Dirac}
  \,.
$$


**Example** Suppose a [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ acts on the [[Poisson manifold]] $X$, by [[Hamiltonian vector field]]s. This is equivalently encoded in a [[moment map]] $\mu : X \to \mathfrak{g}^*$. 

Let then $I$ be the [[ideal]] of functions that vanish on $\mu^{-1}(0)$. This is always coisotropic. 

Then $A_{red}$ is the algebraic dual to the preimage $\mu^{-1}(0)$ quotiented by the Lie algebra action: the "constraint surface" quotiented by the symmetries.

In fact, if 0 is a [[regular value]] of $\mu$ then $X_{red} := \mu^{-1}(0)/G$ is a submanifold and

$$
  A_{red} \simeq C^\infty(X_{red})
  \,.
$$ 


We now discuss the BRST-BV complex for the set of constraints $I$ on $(X, \{-,-\})$, which will be a resolution of $A_{red}$ in the following sense:

* instead of forming the [[quotient]] $X/G$ we form the [[action groupoid]] or [[quotient stack]] $X//G$. More precisely we do this for the infinitesimal action and consider a quotient [[Lie algebroid]];

* instead of forming the intersecton $X|_{I = 0}$ we consider its derived locus.

Let $\{T_1, \cdots, T_N\}$ be any finite set of gnerators of the [[ideal]] $I$. Then there exists a non-positively graded [[cochain complex]] on the graded algebra

$$
  A \otimes Sym(V)
  \,,
$$

where $V$ is a [[graded vector space]] in non-positive degree and $Sym(V)$ is its symmetric [[tensor algebra]]: the [[Koszul-Tate resolution]] of $C^\infty(X)/I$.

Then on

$$
  A \otimes Sym(V) \otimes Sym(V^*)
$$

(with $V^*$ in non-negative degree)

there is an evident graded generalization of the Poisson bracket on $A$, which is on $V$ and $V^*$ just the canonical pairing.

Write $\{c^\alpha\}$ for the [[basis]] for $V^*$, called the **ghosts**. Write $\{\pi_\alpha\}$ for the dual basis on $V$, called the **ghost momenta**.

**Theorem** (Henneaux, Stasheff et al.) 

([[homological perturbation theory]])

There exists an element 

$$
  \Omega \in A \otimes S(V) \otimes S(V^*)
$$

the **BRST-BV charge** such that

* $\{\Omega, \Omega\} =  0$, so that $(A\otimes S(V) \otimes S(V^*), d := \{\Omega, -\})$ is a [[cochain complex]], in fact a [[dg-algebra]];

* the [[cochain cohomology]] is

  $$
    H^0(A \otimes S(V) \otimes S(V^*), d = \{\Omega, -\}) = A/I
    \;
  $$

  $$
    H^{\lt 0}(A \otimes S(V) \otimes S(V^*), d = \{\Omega, -\}) = 0
    \;
  $$

  (which says that this is in non-positive degree a resolution of the constraint locus $A/I$)

* If $I$ is a regular ideal (meaing that $V$ can be chosen to be concentrated in degree 1) or the vanishing ideal of a coisotropic submanifold, then the cohomology in positive degree 


  $$
    H^{\bullet \geq 0}(A \otimes S(V) \otimes S(V^*), d = \{\Omega, 0\})
    \simeq
    H^\bullet(CE(A/I, I/I^2))
  $$

  is isomorphic to the [[infinity-Lie algebra cohomology|Lie algebroid cohomology]] of the [[Lie algebroid]] whose [[Lie-Rinehart algebra]] is $(A/I, I/I^2)$

  (which says that in positive degree the BRST-BV complex is a resolution of the [[action Lie algebroid]] of $\{I,-\}$ acting on $X$).


**Theorem** (Oh-Park, Cattaneo-Felder) If $C \subset X$ is coisotropic, there is an [[L-infinity algebra]]-structure on $\wedge^\bullet  \Gamma(N C)$ such that the induced bracket on $H^0 = A_{red}$ is the given one;

**Theorem** (Schätz) The BRST-BV complex with $\{-,-\}$ as its Lie bracket is [[quasi-isomorphism|quasi-isomorphic]] to the above.


## Lagrangian BV
 {#LagrangianBV}

Given a non-degenerate action functional $S : C \to \mathbb{R}$ (i.e., one that does not possess gauge symmetries), the derived manifold of Lagrangian BV is constructed by extending $S$ to an element $S^{BV} \in \mathcal{X}^\bullet(C)$ of the algebra of [[multivector field]]s ("antifields") of $C$, such that 

$$
  (S^{BV},S^{BV}) = 0
$$

(the "master equation") with respect to the [[Schouten bracket]] $(-,-) : \mathcal{X}^\bullet(X) \otimes \mathcal{X}^\bullet(C) \to\mathcal{X}^\bullet(C)$ (the "anti-bracket") and then considering the formal dual of the [[dg-algebra]] $(\mathcal{X}^\bullet(C), d = (S^{BV},-))$.

When the action $S$ is degenerate, the BV complex has to be extended further.

The central theorem says that formal integration in this dg-manifold over [[Lagrangian submanifold]]s with respect to the Schouten bracket regarded as an odd Poisson bracket is independent of the choice of Lagrangian submanifold precisely due to the equation $(S,S) = 0$.



### The standard construction
 {#StandardLagrangianBV}

We discuss the standard constructions and theorems in Lagrangian BV formalism. The discussion here is supposed to be a direct formalization of the informal discussion in the standard physics literature (e.g. [HenneauxTeitelboim](#HenneauxTeitelboim)) but more pedestrian and more lightweight than for instance the more powerful formalization of ([BeilinsonDrinfeld](#BeilinsonDrinfeld)).

Let $k$ be a [[field]] of [[characteristic]] 0. Write $dgcAlg_{k}$ for the [[category]] of graded-commutative [[dg-algebra]]s over $k$ (not assumed to be finitely generated and not assumed to be bounded). For the present discussion we regared the [[opposite category]] $Space := dgAlg_k^{op}$ as our category of [[space]]s and write

$$
  \mathcal{O} : Space \stackrel{=}{\to}  dgAlg_k^{op}
$$

to indicate that a space $X \in C$ is defined as having an algebra of functions $\mathcal{O} \in dgAlg_k$.

See [[dg-geometry]] for a more comprehensive discussion of the ambient [[higher geometry]].

We write

$$
  \mathbb{A}^1 \in Space
$$

for the canonical [[line object]] in $Space$, the [[affine line]]. This is the space defined by the fact that its dg-algebra of functions 

$$
  \mathcal{O}(\mathbb{A}^1) = k[x]
$$

is the [[polynomial]] algebra over $k$ on a single generator. 

The starting point of standard Lagrangian BV is

1. a space $C \in Space$ such that $\mathcal{O}(C) \in CAlg_k \hookrightarrow dgAlg_k$ is an ordinary [[associative algebra|commutative algebra]] over $k$, called the **[[configuration space]]**;

1. a morphism in $Space$

   $$
     S : C \to \mathbb{A}^1
     \,,
   $$
   
   called the **[[action functional]]** .

Dually $S$ is a morphism

$$
  \mathcal{O}(C) \leftarrow \mathcal{O}(\mathbb{A}^1) = k[x] : S^*
  \,.
$$

By the defining [[free functor|free property]] of $\mathbb{A}^1$ and since $\mathcal{O}(C)$ is assumed to be concentrated in degree 0, this morphism is fixed by its image $S^*(x)$ and hence we may identify $S$ as an element in $\mathcal{O}(C)$

$$
  S \in \mathcal{O}(C)
  \,.
$$

Write $\Omega^1(C)$ for the $\mathcal{O}(C)$-[[module]] of [[Kähler differential]]s on $C$. By its defining property there is a [[bijection]] between [[derivation]]s

$$
  v : \mathcal{O}(C) \to \mathcal{O}(C)
$$

and $\mathcal{O}(C)$-[[module]] homomorphism

$$
  \iota_v : \Omega^1(C) \to \mathcal{O}(C)
$$

to be thought of a giving by evaluating a 1-form on the [[vector field]] corresponding to the derivation.

Conversely, the fixed [[Kähler differential]]

$$
  d S \in \Omega^1(C)
$$

defines a $k$-linear function

$$
  \iota_{d S} 
    : 
   Der(\mathcal{O}(C)) 
    \to 
   \mathcal{O}(C)
$$

by $v \mapsto \iota_v (d S)$.

We define the following notions

* the [[kernel]]

  $$
    N_S 
      \hookrightarrow 
    Der(\mathcal{O}(S))
      \stackrel{\iota_{d S}}{\to}
    \mathcal{O}(C)
  $$

  of $\iota_{d S}$ is called the module of **[[Noether identities]]** of the [[action functional]] $S$.

* the [[image]]

  $$
    \iota_{d S}
    :
    Der(\mathcal{O}(S))
    \to
     I_S
     \hookrightarrow
    \mathcal{O}(C)
  $$

  is called the **Euler-Lagrange ideal** of $S$. The space whose function algebra is the [[quotient]]

  $$
    \mathcal{O}(C_{\{d S = 0\}}) = \mathcal{O}(C)/I_S
  $$

  is the unresolved [[covariant phase space]] of $S$.

Consider then the [[dg-algebra]]

$$
  Sym_{\mathcal{O}(C)}(
    N_S \to Der(\mathcal{O}(C)) \stackrel{\iota_{d S}}{\to} \mathcal{O}(C)
  )
$$

free on the [[cochain complex]] of $\mathcal{O}(C)$-[[module]]s 

$$
  \array{
    N_S &\hookrightarrow& Der(\mathcal{O}(C)) &\to& \mathcal{O}(C)
    \\
    -2 && -1 && 0
  }
$$

with degrees as indicated. One says that the generators in degree 0 are the _fields_ , the generators degree -1 the _antifields_ and the generators in degree -2 the _antighosts_ .

This comes with a canonical morphism

$$
  \array{
    Sym_{\mathcal{O}(C)}(
      N_S \to Der(\mathcal{O}(C)) \stackrel{\iota_{d S}}{\to} 
     \mathcal{O}(C)
  )
  \\
  \downarrow
  \\
  \mathcal{O}(C)/I_S
  }
$$

that is a [[quasi-isomorphism]]. Under suitable conditions on $\mathcal{O}(C)$ and $S$, this is a [[resolution]] of $\mathcal{O}(C)/_S$ by a complex of [[projective object]]s in the category of $\mathcal{O}(C)$-[[module]]s, hence a cofibrant resolution of the unresolved [[covariant phase space]] with function algebra $\mathcal{O}(C)/I_S$ in a typical [[model structure on dg-algebras]]. Under non-suitable conditions $N_S$ itself needs to be further resolved in order to achieve this. 

The main point of the Lagrangian BV construction is that this resolution naturally carries a useful [[BV-algebra]] structure. The [[Poisson 2-algebra]]-structure is induced by the [[Schouten bracket]] on the [[polyvector field]]s $Der(\mathcal{O})$.

(...)

### As a derived critical locus

In ([CostelloGwilliam](#CostelloGwilliam)) it is obsserved that the BV-complex ought to play the role of the [[critical locus]] of the [[action functional]] as seen in [[derived geometry]].

Some details on this are currently at [[schreiber:derived critical locus]].


### Poincare duality on Hochschild (co)homology

We comment on ueful interpretation of the role played by the
algebra of [[multivector field]]s in the above.

Multivector fields may be understood in terms of [[Hochschild cohomology]] of $C$.
Under the identification of 
[[nLab:Hochschild homology]]/[[nLab:cyclic homology]] with 
the [[nLab:de Rham complex]] the product of the 
[[nLab:action functional]] 
$\exp(i S(-)) : C \to S^1$ with a formal [[nLab:measure]] $vol$
on $C$ is regarded as cycle in [[nLab:cyclic homology]]. Or rather, 
an isomorphism with [[nLab:Hochschild cohomology]] is picked,
interpreted as a choice of [[nLab:volume form]] $vol$ and 
$\exp(i S(-))$ is regarded as a cocycle in cyclic cohomology, hence
as a [[nLab:multivector field]] whose closure condition

$$
  \Delta \exp(i S(-)) = 0
$$ 

is called the _master equation_ of BV-formalis.

By the identification of [[nLab:Hochschild cohomology]]  
with functions on [[nLab:derived loop space]]s we know that 
the operator $\Delta$ encodes the rotation of loops. 
Accordingly, the resuling [[nLab:BV-algebra]] has an interpretation
as an algebra over (the homology of) the 
[[nLab:framed little disk operad]]. This we discuss 
[below](#BVAlgebra).



We indicate how on a finite dimensional smooth manifold the [[BV-algebra]] appearing in Lagrangian BV-formalism is the dual of the [[de Rham complex]] of [[configuration space]] in the presence of a [[volume form]]. (This observation goes back to [Witten90](#Witten90)). Then we discuss the generalization of this statement given by [[Poincare duality]] on [[Hochschild cohomology|Hochschild (co)homology]].

The [[path integral]] in [[quantum field theory]] is supposed to be the integral over a field [[configuration space]] $X$ using a [[measure]] $\mu_S$ which is conceived in the form

$$
  \mu_S(\phi) = \exp(\frac{i}{\hbar} S(\phi)) \mu(\phi)
  \;\;\;\;
  \phi \in X
  \,,
$$

for $\mu$ some other measure and $S : X \to \mathbb{R}$ the _[[action functional]]_.

If one thinks of $X$ as an ordinary $(d \lt \infty)$-[[dimension]]al [[smooth manifold]], $d\mu_S$ will be given by a [[volume form]], $\mu_S \in \Omega^d(X)$. By contraction of [[multivector field]]s with forms, every choice of volume form on $X$ induces an [[isomorphism]] between [[differential form]]s and [[polyvector field]]s

$$
  \mu : \Omega^\bullet(X) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  \wedge^{-\bullet} \Gamma(T X)
  \,,
$$

which is usefully thought of as reversing degrees. Under this isomorphism the deRham differential maps to a divergence operator conventionally denoted

$$
  \mu : d \mapsto \Delta
$$

which interacts naturally with the canonical bracket on multivector fields: the [[Schouten bracket]]. (See [[polyvector field]] for more details.)

The point to notice now is

* if we think of 

  * the measure $\mu$ as some closed reference differential form on $X$;

  *  the exponentiated action functional $exp(\frac{i}{\hbar}S(-))$ as a multivector field on $X$;

  * the expression $exp(\frac{i}{\hbar}S(-)) \mu$ as the contraction of this multivector field with $\mu$

* then the **BV quantum master equaton**
$\Delta \exp(\frac{i}{\hbar}S) = 0$ says nothing but that
$exp(\frac{i}{\hbar}S(-)) \mu$ is a _closed differential form_.

* If we furthermore take into account that in the presence of gauge symmetries the space $X$ is not a plain manifold but the $L_\infty$-[[Lie infinity-algebroid|algebroid]] of the gauge symmetries acting on the space of fields, hence an [[NQ-supermanifold]] (whose Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra is the **BRST complex**), then this just says that $\exp(\frac{i}{\hbar}S) \mu$ is an [[integration over supermanifolds|integrable form]] in the sense of [[integration over supermanifolds|integration theory of supermanifolds]].

This means that Lagrangian BV formalism is nothing but a way of describing closed differential forms on $L_\infty$-[[Lie infinity-algebroid|algebroid]]s in terms of multivectors contracted into a reference differention form. The multivectors dual to degree 0 elements in the $L_\infty$-[[Lie infinity-algebroid|algebroid]] are the so-called "**anti-fields**", while those dual to the higher degree elements are the so-called "**anti-ghosts**".

Generally, for certain algebras $A$ there exists Poincare duality between [[Hochschild cohomology]] and [[Hochschild homology]]

$$
  \tau : HH_i(A) \to HH^{n-i}(A)
$$

([VanDenBergh](#VanDenBergh)) and this takes the [[Connes coboundary operator]] to the [[BV operator]] ([Ginzburg](#Ginzburg)).
