## Idea

Traditional [[geometric quantization]] applies to [[symplectic manifolds]] but not to [[Poisson manifolds]]. However, every Poisson manifold can be regarded as a [[symplectic Lie n-algebroid]]: a [[Poisson Lie algebroid]]. This is symplectic, in [[higher symplectic geometry]]. Its [[Lie integration]] is a [[symplectic groupoid]].

There is an generalization of the machinery of geometric quantization to [[symplectic groupoids]] which hence provides a geometric quantization of [[Poisson manifolds]].

## Properties

### Relation to deformation quantization

There does not seem to be in the literazure a precise relation between the methods of [[geometric quantization]] discussed here and methods of [[deformation quantization]]. But the following similarity might be relevant:

If the task is to quantize a [[Poisson manifold]], then both methods, [[Maxim Kontsevich]]'s construction of [[deformation quantization]] as well as [[Eli Hawkins]]' geometric quantization pass through a [[n-plectic geometry|2-plectic geometry]] on the [[Poisson Lie algebroid]] which is induced by the Poisson manifold; Kontsevich's construction of the [[star product]], as clarified by Cattaneo and Felder, is really that of the 3-point function in the 2-dimension [[sigma-model]] QFT whose [[target space]] is that Poisson Lie algebroid -- the [[Poisson sigma-model]] --, and the symplectic 2-groupoid that Hawkins et al consider is the 
"extended" geometric quantization over the as in [[extended prequantum field theory]] associated with this theory.

For more on this see at [[extended geometric quantization of 2d Chern-Simons theory]]

## Definition

Given a [[symplectic groupoid]] $(X,\omega)$, the symplectic form defines a class in degree-3 [[de Rham cohomology]] $H_{dR}^3(X)$. 

(Notice that, while this $\omega$ is typically expressed as a 2-form on $X_1$, this represents indeed a degree-3 cocycle in the [[simplicial de Rham complex]] of the [[nerve]] of $X$).

We say that $\omega$ is _integral_ if it is in the image of the [[curvature]] map 

$$
  curv : H^2_{diff}(X,U(1)) \to H^3_{dR}(X)
$$

from the [[ordinary differential cohomology]] of $X$. If this is the case, we say that a lift $(\hat X, \nabla)$ of $\omega$ to $\mathbf{H}_{diff}(X, \mathbf{B}^2 U(1))$, hence to the [[2-groupoid]] of [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle 2-bundles with connection]] over $X$, is a **prequantum line bundle** for $(X,\omega)$.

Notice that this traditional terminology is off by one: the underlying $\hat X \to X$ is a [[circle 2-group]]-[[principal 2-bundle]] on $X$.
