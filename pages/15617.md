## Idea

Forming the [[kernel]] of an [[adic completion]] map is sometimes called forming the _adic residual_, for instance the _$p$-residual_ for $p$-adic completion.

## Properties

### Explicit characterization

For $A$ a [[commutative ring]] and $\mathfrak{a} \subset A$ an ideal, and $N$ an $A$-module, then the $\mathfrak{a}$-adic residual of $N$ (hence the kernel of the map to the [[completion of a module]] $N \longrightarrow N^\wedge_{\mathfrak{a}}$) is equivalently the submodule of elements annihilated by $1 + \mathfrak{a}$.

E.g. theorem 4.3.2. here: [[Completion.pdf:file]]

### As a modality in arithmetic cohesion

For suitably well behaved ideals, forming the adic residual may be understood as the [[dR-flat modality]] in the [[cohesion]] of [[E-infinity arithmetic geometry]]:
