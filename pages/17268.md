## Idea


The _classical model structure on simplicial sets_ or _Kan-Quillen model structure_ , $sSet_{Quillen}$ ([Quillen 67, II.3](#Quillen67)) is a [[model category]] structure on the [[category]] [[sSet]] of [[simplicial sets]] which represents the standard classical [[homotopy theory]]. 

Its [[weak equivalences]] are the [[weak homotopy equivalences]] ([[isomorphisms]] on [[simplicial homotopy groups]]), its [[fibrations]] are the [[Kan fibrations]] and its [[cofibrations]] are the [[monomorphisms]] (degreewise injections).

The [[singular simplicial complex]]/[[geometric realization]] [[nerve and realization|adjunction]] constitutes a [[Quillen equivalence]] between 
$sSet_{Quillen}$ and $Top_{Quillen}$, the [[classical model structure on topological spaces]]. This is sometimes called part of the statement of the _[[homotopy hypothesis]]_ [for Kan complexes](homotopy+hypothesis#ForKanComplexes). In the language of [[(∞,1)-category theory]] this means that $sSet_{Quillen}$ and $Top_{Quillen}$ both are [[presentable (∞,1)-category|presentations]] of the [[(∞,1)-category]] [[∞Grpd]] of [[∞-groupoids]].

There are also other model structures on [[sSet]] itself, see at _[[model structure on simplicial sets]]_ for more. This entry here focuses on just the standard classical model structure.

## Details


The [[classical model structure on simplicial sets]], $sSet_{Quillen}$, has the following distinguished classes of morphisms:

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

* The **cofibrations** $C$ are simply the [[monomorphism]]s $f : X \to Y$ which are precisely the levelwise injections, i.e. the morphisms of simplicial sets such that $f_n : X_n \to Y_n$ is an injection of sets for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

* The **weak equivalences** $W$ are **weak homotopy equivalences**, i.e., morphisms whose [[simplicial set|geometric realization]] is a weak homotopy equivalence of topological spaces.

=--

* The **fibrations** $F$ are the **[[Kan fibration]]s**, i.e., maps $f : X \to Y$ which have the [[right lifting property]] with respect to all [[horn]] inclusions.
  $$
    \array{
      \Lambda^k[n] &\to& X
      \\
      \downarrow &{}^\exists\nearrow& \downarrow^f 
      \\
      \Delta[n] &\to& Y
    }
    \,.
  $$

* A morphism $f : X \to Y$ of fibrant simplicial sets / [[Kan complex]]es is a weak equivalence precisely if it induces an [[isomorphism]] on all [[simplicial homotopy groups]].

* All simplicial sets are cofibrant with respect to this model structure. 

* The fibrant objects are precisely the [[Kan complex|Kan complexes]].

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The **acyclic fibrations** (i.e. the maps that are both fibrations as well as weak equivalences) between [[Kan complex]]es are precisely the morphisms $f : X \to Y$ that have the [[right lifting property]] with respect to all inclusions $\partial \Delta[n] \hookrightarrow \Delta[n]$ of boundaries of $n$-simplices into their $n$-simplices
  $$
    \array{
      \partial \Delta[n] &\to& X
      \\
      \downarrow &{}^\exists\nearrow& \downarrow^f 
      \\
      \Delta[n] &\to& Y
    }
    \,.
  $$

This appears spelled out for instance as ([Goerss-Jardine, theorem 11.2](#GoerssJardine)).


In fact:

###### Proposition

$sSet_{Quillen}$ is a [[cofibrantly generated model category]] with

* generating cofibrations the [[boundary]] inclusions $\partial \Delta[n] \to \Delta[n]$;

* generating acyclic cofibrations the [[horn]] inclusions $\Lambda^i[n] \to \Delta[n]$.

### Characterisations of weak homotopy equivalences

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

Let $W$ be the smallest class of morphisms in $sSet$ satisfying the following conditions:

1. The class of monomorphisms that are in $W$ is closed under [[pushout]], [[transfinite composition]], and [[retracts]].
2. $W$ has the [[two-out-of-three]] property in $sSet$ and contains all the [[isomorphisms]].
3. For all natural numbers $n$, the unique morphism $\Delta [n] \to \Delta [0]$ is in $W$.

Then $W$ is the class of weak homotopy equivalences.
=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

* First, notice that the horn inclusions $\Lambda^0 [1] \hookrightarrow \Delta [1]$ and $\Lambda^1 [1] \hookrightarrow \Delta [1]$ are in $W$.
* Suppose that the horn inclusion $\Lambda^k [m] \hookrightarrow \Delta [m]$ is in $W$ for all $m \lt n$ and all $0 \le k \le m$. Then for $0 \le l \le n$, the horn inclusion $\Lambda^l [n] \hookrightarrow \Delta [n]$ is also in $W$.
* Quillen's [[small object argument]] then implies all the trivial cofibrations are in $W$.
* If $p : X \to Y$ is a trivial Kan fibration, then its right lifting property implies there is a morphism $s : Y \to X$ such that $p \circ s = id_Y$, and the two-out-of-three property implies $s : Y \to X$ is a trivial cofibration. Thus every trivial Kan fibration is also in $W$.
* Every weak homotopy equivalence factors as $p \circ i$ where $p$ is a trivial Kan fibration and $i$ is a trivial cofibration, so every weak homotopy equivalence is indeed in $W$.
* Finally, noting that the class of weak homotopy equivalences satisfies the conditions in the theorem, we deduce that it is the _smallest_ such class.

As a corollary, we deduce that the classical model structure on $sSet$ is the smallest (in terms of weak equivalences) model structure for which the cofibrations are the monomorphisms and the weak equivalences include the (combinatorial) homotopy equivalences.

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Let $\pi_0 : sSet \to Set$ be the connected components functor, i.e. the left adjoint of the constant functor $cst : Set \to sSet$. A morphism $f : Z \to W$ in $sSet$ is a weak homotopy equivalence if and only if the induced map
$$\pi_0 K^f : \pi_0 K^W \to \pi_0 K^Z$$
is a bijection for all _Kan complexes_ $K$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

One direction is easy: if $K$ is a Kan complex, then axiom SM7 for [[simplicial model categories]] implies  the functor $K^{(-)} : sSet^{op} \to sSet$ is a right [[Quillen functor]], so Ken Brown's lemma implies it preserves all weak homotopy equivalences; in particular, $\pi_0 K^{(-)} : sSet^{op} \to Set$ sends weak homotopy equivalences to bijections.

Conversely, when $K$ is a Kan complex, there is a natural bijection between $\pi_0 K^X$ and the hom-set $Ho (sSet) (X, K)$, and thus by the [[Yoneda lemma]], a morphism $f : Z \to W$ such that the induced morphism $\pi_0 K^W \to \pi_0 K^Z$ is a bijection for all Kan complexes $K$ is precisely a morphism that becomes an isomorphism in $Ho (sSet)$, i.e. a weak homotopy equivalence.

The proof there is purely combinatorial (i.e. does not use topological spaces): he uses the theory of [[minimal Kan fibrations]], the fact that the latter are fiber bundles, as well as the fact that the [[classifying space]] of a [[simplicial group]] is a [[Kan complex]].

which discusses the topic as a special case of a _[[Cisinski model structure]]_.


The fun part is not that much about the existence of model structure, but to prove that the fibrations are precisely the [[Kan fibrations]] (and also to prove all the good properties of $Ex^\infty$ without using topological spaces); for two different proofs of this fact using $Ex^\infty$, see Prop. 2.1.41 as well as Scholium 2.3.21 for an alternative). For the rest, everything was already in the book of Gabriel and Zisman, for instance.
