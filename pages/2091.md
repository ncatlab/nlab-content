The ideal completion of a [[category]] $C$ generalises the notion of [[ideal]] completion of a [[partially ordered set]]. It is formed by taking the category of [[ideal in a category|ideals]] of $C$. It is the completion of $C$ under [[filtered colimit]]s of [[monomorphisms]].

"The actual definition requires either some care in specifying choices of monomorphisms, as is done in [4], or a sheaf-theoretic approach as in [5]."
