## Idea

In [[gauge theory]] cocycles in [[differential cohomology]] model _gauge fields_. 

By definition, every [[differential cohomology]] theory $\Gamma^\bullet(-)$ comes with a characteristic curvature form morphism

$$
  F : \bar \Gamma^\bullet(X) \to \Omega^\bullet(X)\otimes \pi_*\Gamma \otimes \mathbb{R}
  \,,
$$

the (generalized) [[Chern character]].

For $c \in \Gamma^\bullet(X)$ a cocycle representing a gauge field in [[gauge theory]], its image $F(c) \in \Omega^\bullet(X)$ is the **field strength** of the gauge field. If we think of this cocycle as being (a generalization of) a [[connection on a bundle]], this is essentially the [[curvature]] of that connection.

Often gauge fields are _named_ after their field strength. For instance the field strength of the [[electromagnetic field]] is the $2$-form $F \in \Omega^2(X)$ whose components are the electric and the magnetic fields.
