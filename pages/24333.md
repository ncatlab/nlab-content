A __one-parameter group__ (of [[unitary operators]] in a [[Hilbert space]]) is a [[homomorphism of groups]]
$$\mathbf{R} \to U(H),$$
where $H$ is a [[Hilbert spaces]] and $U(H)$ denotes its group of [[unitary operators]].

More generally, one can define __one-parameter semigroups__ of operators in a [[Banach space]] $X$ as homomomorphisms of monoids
$$\mathbf{R}_{\ge0} \to B(X),$$
where $B(X)$ denotes the semigroup of bounded operators $X\to X$.

Typically, we also require a continuity condition such as continuity in the [[strong topology]].

## Stone theorem

Strongly continuous one-parameter unitary groups $(U_t)_{t\ge0}$ of operators in a Hilbert space $H$
are in bijection with self-adjoint [[unbounded operators]] $A$ on $H$

The bijection sends
$$A\mapsto (t\mapsto \exp(itA)).$$

The operator $A$ is bounded if and only if $U$ is norm-continuous.

## Hille–Yosida theorem

Strongly continuous one-parameter semigroups $T$ of bounded operators on a [[Banach space]] $X$ (alias __$C_0$-semigroups__) satisfying $\|T(t)\|\le M\exp(\omega t)$ are in bijection with closed operators $A\colon X\to X$ with dense domain such that any $\lambda\gt \omega$ belongs to the resolvent set of $A$
and for any $\lambda\gt\omega$ we have
$$\|(\lambda I-A)^{-n}\|\le M (\lambda-\omega)^{-n}.$$
