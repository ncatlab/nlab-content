## Idea 

A classical theorem of Giraud's characterizes [[sheaf toposes]] abstractly as [[categories]] with certain [[properties]].

In [[higher topos theory]] there are corresponding analogs of this theorem

* 1-category case: see _[[Grothendieck topos]]_;

* [[2-category]] case: see [[michaelshulman:2-Giraud theorem]];

* [[(infinity,1)-category]] case: see _[[(infinity,1)-topos]]_
