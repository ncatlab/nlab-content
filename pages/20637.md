## Idea

(...)

The _Dwyer-Wilkinson space_ $G_3$ ([Dwyer-Wilkerson 93](#DwyerWilkerson93)) is a [[p-adic completion|2-complete]] [[H-space]] which looks (at prime 2) like the next in line of a series of (two) finite loop-spaces, starting with [[G2]]

## Properties

### Cohomology

The [[ordinary cohomology]] of $G_3$ with [[coefficients]] in the [[prime field]] $\mathbb{F}_2$ is an [[exterior algebra]] on generators of degree 7, 11, 13, 14 so it's (2-locally) a  Poincar\'e duality space of dimension 45.


### Weyl group

The analog of the [[Weyl group]] for $G_3$ is $\mathbb{Z}/2 \times GL(3,\mathbb{F}_2)$.


### Homotopy coset space $G_3/Spin(7)$

$G_3$ receives a homomorphism from [[Spin(7)]]. The [[homotopy fiber]] of the corresponding [[delooping]] mapo is a homotopy-[[coset space]] 

$$
  G_3/Spin(7)
$$

The [[ordinary cohomology]] with [[coefficients]] in the [[prime field]] $\mathbb{F}_2$ of this space

1. is concentrated in even degrees,

1. has [[Euler characteristic]] 24.
