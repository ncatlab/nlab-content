## Idea

The _Dwyer-Wilkerson space_ $G_3$ ([Dwyer-Wilkerson 93](#DwyerWilkerson93)) is a [[p-adic completion|2-complete]] [[H-space]], in fact a finite [[loop space]]/[[∞-group]], such that the mod 2 [[cohomology ring]] of its [[classifying space]]/[[delooping]] is the mod 2 [[Dickson invariants]] of rank 4. As such, it is the fifth and last space (see [below](#Cohomology)) in a series of [[∞-groups]] that starts with 4 [[compact Lie groups]], namely with the [automorphism groups of real normed division algebras](normed+division+algebra#Automorphisms):

| $n=$ | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| $DI(n)=$ | [[trivial group|1]] |  [[Z/2]] | [[SO(3)]] | [[G2]] | [[G3]] |
|          | = Aut(R) | [= Aut(C)](complex+number#AutomorphismsOfComplexNumbersIsZ2)        | [= Aut(H)](quaternion#AutomorphismsOfQUatrnionsAlgebraIsSO3)       |  [= Aut(O)](octonion#AutomorphismsOfOctonionAlgebraIsG2)  |   |

whence the notation "$G_3$" (suggested in [Møller 95, p. 5](#Moller95)).

While $G_3$ is not a [[compact Lie group]], it is a [[p-compact group|2-compact group]], hence a "[[homotopy Lie group]]" (see [below](#AsA2CompactGroup)).

The above progression starting with the [[automorphism groups]] of [[real numbers|real]] [[normed division algebras]] suggests that $G_3$ has a geometric or algebraic relevance in a context of [[division algebra and supersymmetry]]. This remains open, but there are speculations, see [below](#RelationToPctomionic3Times3HermitianMatrices).


## Properties

### Cohomology
 {#Cohomology}

The [[ordinary cohomology]] of the [[classifying space]]/[[delooping]] $B G_3$ with [[coefficients]] in the [[prime field]] $\mathbb{F}_2$ is, as an [[associative algebra]] over the [[Steenrod algebra]], the ring of mod 2 [[Dickson invariants]] of rank 4. This is the ring of invariants of the natural action of $GL(4, \mathbf{F}_2)$ on the rank 4 polynomial algebra $H^{\ast}((B \mathbf{Z}/2)^4, \mathbf{F}_2)$, a polynomial algebra on classes $c_8$, $c_12$, $c_14$, and $c_15$ with $Sq^4 c_8 = c_{12}$, $Sq^2 c_{12} = c_{14}$, and $Sq^1 c_{14} = c_{15}$.

([Dwyer-Wilkerson 93, Theorem 1.1](#DwyerWilkerson93))



As such, $G_3$ is the last in a series of [[∞-groups]] whose [[classifying spaces]]/[[deloopings]] have as mod 2 [[cohomology ring]] the mod 2 [[Dickson invariants]] for rank $n$, which starts with three ordinary [[compact Lie groups]]:

| $n=$ | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 
|--|--|--|--|--|
| $DI(n)=$ | [[Z/2]] | [[SO(3)]] | [[G2]] | [[G3]] |

([Dwyer-Wilkerson 93, top of p. 38 (2 of 28)](#DwyerWilkerson93))




This means in particular that the cohomology is an [[exterior algebra]] on generators of degree 7, 11, 13, 14 so it's (2-locally) a [[Poincaré duality space]] of [[dimension]] 45.

(...)

### Construction as a homotopy colimit

The space $B G_3$ is the 2-completion of the homotopy colimit of a diagram ([Notbohm 03, Sec. 2](#Notbohm), [Ziemianski, 0.2.3](#Ziemianski)).


### As a 2-compact group
 {#AsA2CompactGroup}

$G_3$ is the only exotic 2-group, or, in other words, the only simple 
[[p-compact group|2-compact group]] not arising as the 2-completion of a compact connected Lie group ([Andersen-Grodal 06](#AndersenGrodal06)).


### Weyl group

The analog of the [[Weyl group]] for $G_3$ is $\mathbb{Z}/2 \times GL(3,\mathbb{F}_2)$.

([Dwyer-Wilkerson 93, middle of p. 38 (2 of 28)](#DwyerWilkerson93))


### Homotopy coset space $G_3/Spin(7)$

$G_3$ receives a homomorphism from [[Spin(7)]]. The [[homotopy fiber]] of the corresponding [[delooping]] map is a homotopy-[[coset space]] 

$$
  G_3/Spin(7)
$$

The [[ordinary cohomology]] with [[coefficients]] in the [[prime field]] $\mathbb{F}_2$ of this space

1. is concentrated in even degrees,

1. has [[Euler characteristic]] 24.

([Dwyer-Wilkerson 93, Theorem 1.8](#DwyerWilkerson93))


### Relation to the Conway group, $Co_3$
{#RelationtoCo3}

$B G_3$ receives a map from $B Co_3$, the [[delooping]] of the [[Conway group]], $Co_3$. This map has the property that it injects the mod two cohomology of $B G_3$ as a subring over which the mod two cohomology of $B Co_3$ is finitely generated as a module (see [Benson 94](#Benson94)). This continues a pattern from $B A_5 \to B SO(3)$ and $B M_{12} \to B G_2$, where $M_{12}$ is a [[Mathieu group]].


### Relation to octonionic $3 \times 3$ matrix algebra?
 {#RelationToPctomionic3Times3HermitianMatrices}

Since, by the [above](#Cohomology), $G_3$ is (2-locally) a [[Poincaré duality space]] of [[dimension]] 45, there has been speculation that it might be related to the $8 + 2 \cdot 8 + 3 \cdot 7 = 45$-dimensional algebra 

$$
  Mat^{skher}_{3 \times 3}(\mathbb{O})
$$

of skew-hermitian [[matrices]] over the [[octonions]] ([Solomon-Stancu 08, p. 175](#SolomonStancu08), [Wilson 09a, slide 94](#Wilson09a), [Benson 98, p. 19](#Benson98)). (Wilson's suggestion appears to arise from his construction of a 3-dimensional octonionic [[Leech lattice]], his representation of its automorphism group, the [[Conway group]] $Co_0$, as right multiplications by $3 \times 3$ matrices over the octonions ([Wilson 09b](#Wilson09b)), and the [relationship](#RelationtoCo3) between the latter's subgroup $Co_3$ and $G_3$.) 

Incidentally, the algebra of $3\times 3$ [[hermitian matrices]] (as opposed to skew-hermitian) over the octonions 

$$
  Mat^{her}_{3 \times 3}(\mathbb{O})
  \;
  \simeq_{\mathbb{R}}
  \;
  \underset{
    dim_{\mathbb{R}} = 26
  }{
  \underbrace{
    \mathbb{R}^{9,1}
      \oplus
    \mathbf{16}
  }}
  \oplus
  \mathbb{R}
  \,.
$$


is the [[exceptional Jordan algebra]]  called the _[[Albert algebra]]_ (see [there](Albert+algebra#RelationTo10dSuperSpacetime)).
 

### Homotopy representation

The possibility of there being a faithful 15-dimensional real homotopy representation of $G_3$ is raised in ([Baker-Bauer 19, p. 8](#BakerBauer)).
