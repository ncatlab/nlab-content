A [[group]] is __nilpotent__ if its [[lower central series]] terminates with the trivial subgroup after finitely many steps. Cf. [[nilpotent Lie algebra]]. 

Every nilpotent group is an example of a [[solvable group]] (indeed, the groups in the [[lower central series]] of any group can be term-wise included into its [[derived series]]).
