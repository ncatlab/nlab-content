_Deligne cohomology_ -- or _[[Pierre Deligne|Deligne]]-[[Alexander Beilinson|Beilinson]] cohomology_ -- is an [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] that models [[ordinary differential cohomology]], a refinement of the [[sheaf cohomology]] with [[coefficients]] in a [[locally constant sheaf|locally constant]] [[abelian sheaf]] (modeling [[ordinary cohomology]]) by [[differential form]] data.

The _Deligne complex_ is like a truncated [[de Rham complex]] but, crucially, with the sheaf of 0-forms -- the [[structure sheaf]] $\mathcal{O}$ - replaced by the [[multiplicative group]] $\mathcal{O}^\times$ under the [[exponential map]]

$$
  \left[
     \mathcal{O}^\times
     \stackrel{d log}{\longrightarrow}
     \Omega^1
     \stackrel{d}{\longrightarrow}
     \Omega^2
     \stackrel{d}{\longrightarrow}
     \cdots
     \stackrel{d}{\longrightarrow}
     \Omega^n
  \right]
  \,.
$$

Deligne cohomology $H^{n+1}_{conn}(X, \mathbb{Z})$ in degree $(n+1)$ is the [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] with [[coefficients]] in this [[chain complex]] of [[sheaves of abelian groups]] ("[[hypercohomology]]"). 

This was introduced in ([Deligne 71](#Deligne71)) in the context of [[analytic geometry]] (hence using [[holomorphic differential forms]]) as a [[Hodge filtration|Hodge-filtered]] version of [[singular cohomology]], designed to be a target for the [[Beilinson regulator]] from [[motivic cohomology]]. But the form of the definition applies more generally, in particular also in smooth [[differential geometry]], a fact amplified and popularized in ([Brylinski 93](#Brylinski93)).

In smooth [[differential geometry]] the typical minor variant has the sheaf $\underline{U}(1) = C^\infty(-,U(1))$ of [[circle group]]-valued [[smooth functions]] in degree $n$:

$$
  \left[
     C^\infty(-,U(1))
     \stackrel{d log}{\longrightarrow}
     \Omega^1
     \stackrel{d}{\longrightarrow}
     \Omega^2
     \stackrel{d}{\longrightarrow}
     \cdots
     \stackrel{d}{\longrightarrow}
     \Omega^n
  \right]
  \,.
$$

Given any [[manifold]] $X$, then the resulting complex of abelian groups is, under the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]], the [[n-groupoid]] of [[circle n-bundles with connection]] whose underlying [[circle n-group|circle (n-1)-group]]-[[principal infinity-bundle]] is trivialized. Passing to the [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] implicitly corresponds to considering the [[infinity-stackification]] of this $n$-groupoid valued presheaf, and in this way Deligne cohomology computes equivalence classes of [[circle n-bundles with connection]]. Another way to say this is that under the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] and [[infinity-stackification]], the above Deligne complex defines a [[smooth infinity-stack]] $\mathbf{B}^n U(1)_{conn}$ which is the universal [[moduli infinity-stack]] for [[circle n-bundles with connection]], and Deligne cohomology computes the [[homotopy classes]] of maps (of [[infinity-stacks]]) into this ([FSS 10](#FSS10))

$$
  H^{n+1}_{conn}(X,\mathbb{Z})
  \simeq
  \pi_0(X \to \mathbf{B}^n U(1)_{conn})
  \,.
$$

In this way Deligne cohomology, or rather the collection of Deligne [[cocycles]] with [[coefficients]] in the Deligne complex that defines it, is considerably richer than other models for [[ordinary differential cohomology]] such as [[Cheeger-Simons differential characters]], which see only the [[cohomology group]], but not the full [[moduli infinity-stack|moduli n-stack]].

Explicitly, computing the [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] with coefficients in the [[Deligne complex]] via [[Cech cohomology]] gives that a [[cocycle]] $\overline{A}$ on some [[space]] $X$ is represented with respect to a suitable [[open cover]] $\{U_i \to X\}$ by a collection of [[differential forms]] and functions

$$
  \overline{A}
  = 
  \left\{
     A_{i_0, \cdots, i_k}
     \in \Omega^{n-k}(U_{i_0, \cdots i_k})
  \right\}_{k = 0}^{n}
  \cup
  \{
     g_{i_0, \cdots, i_n} \in \mathcal{O}^\times(U_{i_0, \cdots, i_{n+1}})
  \}
$$

such that the failure of the $(n-k+1)$-forms to glue on $(k+1)$-fold intersections of charts is given by the de Rham differential of the $(n-k)$-forms

$$
  \sum_{j = 0}^k
  (-1)^j
  A_{i_0, \cdots, i_{j-1}, i_{j+1}, \cdots, i_{k+1}}
  =
  d_{dR} A_{i_0, \cdots, i_{k+1}}
  \,.
$$


This evidently generalizes the familiar Cech cocycle data for traditional [[line bundles with connection]].

As the notation indicates, Deligne cohomology is a [[differential cohomology]] refinement of [[ordinary cohomology]] with [[integer]] [[coefficients]], exhibited by a canonical forgetful map

$$
  \array{
    H^{n+1}_{conn}(X,\mathbb{Z})
    \\
    & \searrow
    \\
    && H^{n+1}(X,\mathbb{Z})   
  }
$$

which is induced by the evident morphism of [[chain complexes]]. This is one map in an exact [[differential hexagon]] which exhibits Deligne cohomology as the differential refinement of ordinary integral cohomology by [[closed differeential form|closed]] [[curvature]] [[differential form]] data.

## Definition

In any context where these symbols make the evident sense, the Deligne complex of degree $(n+1)$ is the [[chain complex]] $\mathcal{O}^\times \stackrel{d log}{\to}\Omega^1 \stackrel{d}{\to} \Omega^2 \to \cdots \to \Omega^n$, and Deligne cohomology in degree $(n+1)$ is the [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] with [[coefficients]] in this complex. 

More generally one considers any [[discrete group]] $A$ and inclusion $A \hookrightarrow \mathcal{O}$ into the [[structure sheaf]], then the corresponding Deligne complex is $A \hookrightarrow \mathcal{O} \stackrel{d}{\to} \Omega^1 \to \cdots \to \Omega^n$.

For definiteness we consider here in detail the Deligne complex in the context of [[differential geometry]] modeled on [[smooth manifolds]]. All variants work essentially directly analogously, but it may be useful to have a specific case in hand. This discussion overlaps with and is put into a broader context at _[[geometry of physics -- principal connections]]_.

### Preliminaries on sheaf cohomology
 {#PreliminariesOnSheafCohomology}

In order to be somewhat self-contained, this section reviews some elements of [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] specified to the context that we need. It also sets up some notation. The definition of the Deligne complex itself is [below](#TheDeligneComplex) in def. \ref{TheSmoothDeligneComplex}.

+-- {: .num_defn #Smooth0Types}
###### Definition

Write [[CartSp]] for the [[site]] whose 

* [[objects]] are [[Cartesian space]]  $\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, 

* [[morphisms]] are [[smooth functions]] $\mathbb{R}^{n_1} \to \mathbb{R}^{n_2}$ between these;

*  whose [[coverage]] is given by "differentially [[good open covers]]", those [[open covers]] of $\mathbb{R}^n$s all whose finite non-empty intersections are [[diffeomorphism|diffeomorphic]] to an [[open ball]], hence again to $\mathbb{R}^n$.

Write $PSh(CartSp) = Func(CartSp^{op},Set)$ for the [[category of presheaves]] over this site. Write

$$
  Smooth0Type \coloneqq Sh(CartSp)
$$

for its [[category of sheaves]], also called the [[cohesive topos]] of [[smooth spaces]].

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Instead of the site [[CartSp]] of def. \ref{Smooth0Types} one could use the site [[SmoothMfd]] of all smooth manifolds. All of the statements and constructions in the following go through in that case just as well. In fact [[CartSp]] is a [[dense subsite]] of [[SmoothMfd]]. On the one hand this implies that the [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] is the same for both sites, but on the other hand means that it is convenient to restrict to the much "smaller" site of Cartesian spaces. In fact since the [[stalks]] of sheaves over smooth manifolds are evaluations on small [[open balls]] and since every open ball is [[diffeomorphism|diffeomorphic]] to a Cartesian space, many statements that are true (only) stalkwise over [[SmoothMfd]] are actually true globally over $CartSp$. It is the "[[descent]]" or "[[infinity-stackification]]" which is implicit in abelian sheaf cohomology that takes care of these global statements over [[CartSp]] to translate into the same local statements as one gets over [[SmoothMfd]].

+-- {: .num_example #RepresentableSheavesAndTheirConstantVersion}
###### Example

The assignment $C^\infty(-,\mathbb{R}) \colon \mathbb{R}^n \mapsto C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n,\mathbb{R})$ of [[smooth functions]] with values in the [[real numbers]] is a [[sheaf]]. Since this is [[representable functor|representable]] we are entitled to identify this with the [[smooth manifold]] $\mathbb{R}$ (the [[real line]]) itself, and just write $\mathbb{R} \in Smooth0Type$. 

Similarly for $X$ any other [[smooth manifold]], it represents a sheaf on [[CartSp]] and we just write $X \in Smooth0Type$ for this.

Of particular interest below is the case where $X = S^1 = \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z} = U(1)$ is the [[circle]], to be regarded as the [[circle group]].

Notice that traditionally the sheaf represented by $\mathbb{R}$ or $U(1)$ is indicated by an underline as in $\underline{\mathbb{R}}$ and $\underline{U}(1)$, but we do not follow this tradition here. 

Instead, if we consider the other sheaf that might deserve to be denoted by $\mathbb{R}$, namely the [[constant sheaf]] on $\mathbb{R}$, which sends each $U \in CartSp$ to the set underlying $\mathbb{R}$, then we write $\flat \mathbb{R}$ for that. Similarly 

$$
  \flat U(1) \in Smooth0Type
$$ 

is the sheaf sending each test manifold to the set of points in the circle, and each smooth function between Cartesian spaces to the identity function on that set.


=--

+-- {: .num_example #SheavesOfFormsAndDeRhamDifferential}
###### Example

For $k \in \mathbb{N}$ write 

$$
  \mathbf{\Omega}^k \in Sh(CartSp)
$$ 

for the [[sheaf]] $\mathbf{\Omega}^k \colon U \mapsto \Omega^k(U)$ of smooth [[differential n-forms|differential k-forms]] on $X$.
The [[de Rham differential]] extends to a morphism of sheaves

$$
  \mathbf{d} \colon \mathbf{\Omega}^k \to \mathbf{\Omega}^{k+1}
  \,.
$$

For positive $k$ its [[kernel]] is the [[subfunctor|sub-sheaf]]

$$
  0 \to 
  \mathbf{\Omega}^k_{cl} \hookrightarrow \mathbf{\Omega}^k
  \stackrel{\mathbf{d}}{\longrightarrow}
  \mathbf{\Omega}^{k+1}
$$

of closed differential forms; and for $k = 0$ its kernel is the
[[subfunctor|sub-sheaf]] of constant functions

$$
  0 \to
  \flat \mathbb{R} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R} 
  \stackrel{\mathbf{d}}{\longrightarrow}
  \mathbf{\Omega}^1
  \,.
$$


=--


In the background, what plays a role for the following is the full [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos|cohesive]] [[homotopy theory]] of [[smooth ∞-groupoids]]. This receives a map from the following coarse [[homotopy theory]] of [[chain complexes]] of [[abelian sheaves]], which is all that is necessary for the present purpose.



+-- {: .num_defn #FibrantOnjectStructureOnChSmooth}
###### Definition

Write

$$
  Ch_+(Smooth0Type)
  =
  Ch_+(Sh(CartSp))
  =
  Sh(CartSp,Ch_+)
$$

for the [[category of chain complexes]] in the smooth sheaves of def. \ref{Smooth0Types}, hence for the [[1-category]] whose objects are [[chain complexes]] of [[abelian sheaves]] on $CartSp$.

Regard this as equipped with the structure of a [[category of fibrant objects]] induced by the [[projective model structure on chain complexes]], hence with classes of [[morphisms]] labeled as follows: a [[chain map]] $f_\bullet \colon A_\bullet \to B_\bullet$ is called

*  a _[[weak equivalence]]_ if it is a [[quasi-isomorphism]], hence if it induces [[isomorphisms]] on ([[sheaves]] of) [[chain homology]] groups;

* a _[[fibration]]_ if it is an [[epimorphism]] (of [[abelian sheaves]]) in positive degree.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark #HomotopyFibersViaFactorizationLemma}
###### Remark


For our purpose the main use of this structure is to compute [[homotopy fibers]] via the [[factorization lemma]]. Namely 

1. every chain map may be replaced, up to weak equivalence of its domain, by a fibration;

1. the [[homotopy fiber]] of a chain map is the ordinary fiber of any of its fibration replacements.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

That the properties in def. \ref{FibrantOnjectStructureOnChSmooth} 
are interpreted in sheaves simply means that they apply [[stalk]]-wise.
For instance a morphism of chain complexes of presheaves
$f_\bullet \colon A_\bullet \to B_\bullet$ is a weak equivalence
precisely if the underlying presheaf of chain complexes becomes
a [[quasi-isomorphism]] for each point $x$ in each Cartesian space
$\mathbb{R}^n$ after restricting 
(via the presheaf structure maps) to a small enough [[open neighbourhood]]
of that point. Similarly for epimorphisms.

=--


+-- {: .num_remark #HomotopyPullbacksPreservedbyInclusionIntoAllSmoothHomotopyTypes}
###### Remark

There is a canonical map of [[homotopy theories]] from $Ch_+(Smooth0Type)$ to the full [[(∞,1)-topos]] [[Smooth∞Grpd]] which is given by applying the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] followed by [[∞-stackification]]. The key point is that this map preserves [[homotopy fiber products]], which is the [[universal construction]] that already captures most of the relevant properties of the Deligne complex. In this way it is sufficient to concentrate on $Ch_+(Smooth0Type)$ for much of the theory.

When writing out the components of chain complexes we will use square brackets always denote the group in degree-0 to the far right, and the group in degree $k$ being $k$ steps to the left from that.

+-- {: .num_example #DeloopingsOfAbelianSheaf}
###### Example

For $A \in Ab(Smooth0Type) = Sh(CartSp,Ab)$ any [[abelian sheaf]] and for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ we write

$$
  (\mathbf{B}^n A)_{\bullet}
  \coloneqq
  A[-n]
  =
  \left[
     A

     \to 0 \to \cdots \to 0
  \right]
$$

for the [[chain complex]] of sheaves concentrated on $A$ in degree $n$.


=--

+-- {: .num_example #LogDiffInSmoothContext}

###### Example

There is a weak equivalence, def. \ref{FibrantOnjectStructureOnChSmooth},


$$
  \left[\mathbb{Z}\to \mathbb{R} \right]
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  U(1)
$$

given by the [[chain map]]

$$
  \array{
     \mathbb{Z} &\hookrightarrow& \mathbb{R}
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{mod\,\mathbb{Z}}}
     \\
     0 &\to& U(1)
  }
$$

(which is just the [[exponential sequence]] regarded as a chain map).
That this is a weak equivalence is the statement that every smooth 
$U(1)$-valued function is locally the quotient of a smooth $\mathbb{R}$-valued function by a $\mathbb{Z}$-valued function. In fact on [[Cartesian spaces]]
this is of course true even globally.

The de Rham differential [[extension|extends]] through this equivalence
to produce a morphism denoted $\mathbf{d} log$:

$$
  \array{
    (\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{R}) &\stackrel{\mathbf{d}}{\longrightarrow}&
    \mathbf{\Omega}^1
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}} & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\mathbf{d} log}}
    \\
    U(1) 
    \,.
  }
$$

On a given $U(1)$-valued function this is given by
representing the function by a smooth $\mathbb{R}$-valued function
under mod-$\mathbb{Z}$-reduction
(which is always possible over a [[Cartesian space]]) and applying the 
de Rham differential to that.

The [[kernel]] of that is the constant sheaf $\flat U(1)$ 
of example \ref{RepresentableSheavesAndTheirConstantVersion}

$$
  0 \to
  \flat U(1) \hookrightarrow U(1)
  \stackrel{\mathbf{d} log}{\longrightarrow}
  \mathbf{\Omega}^1
  \,.
$$


=--


Under addition of differential forms, the sheaves $\mathbf{\Omega}^k$ of example \ref{SheavesOfFormsAndDeRhamDifferential} becomes [[abelian sheaves]], and we will implicitly understand them this way now.

###### Proof

By the [[Poincaré lemma]]. This _is_ the Poincaré Lemma.

=--

Every $A_\bullet \in Ch_+(Smooth0Type)$ serves as the [[coefficients]] for an [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] theory on smooth manifolds. Abelian sheaf cohomology has a general abstract characterization (see at _[[cohomology]]_) in terms of [[derived hom-spaces]]. For definiteness, we recall the model for this construction given by [[Cech cohomology]]
.
+-- {: .num_defn #CechComplex}
###### Definition
**(Čech complex)**

Let $X$ be a [[smooth manifold]] and let $A_\bullet \in Ch_+(Smooth0Type)$ be a sheaf of chain complexes. Let $\{U_i \to X\}$ be a [[good open cover]] of $X$, i.e. an open cover such that each finite non-empty intersection $U_{i_0, \cdots, i_k}$ is [[diffeomorphism|diffeomorphic]] to an [[open ball]]/[[Cartesian space]].

The **Čech cochain complex** $C^\bullet((X,\{U_i\}),A_\bullet)$ 
of $X$ with respect to the cover $\{U_i \to X\}$ and with [[coefficients]] in $A_\bullet$ is in degree $k \in \mathbb{N}$ given by the [[abelian group]]

$$
  C^k((X,\{U_i\}),A_\bullet)
  \coloneqq
  \oplus_{{l,n} \atop {k = n-l}}
  \oplus_{i_0, i_1, \cdots, i_n}
  A_l(U_{i_0, \cdots, i_n})
$$


which is the [[direct sum]] of the values of $A_\bullet$ on the given intersections as indicated; and whose [[differential]] 

$$
  d
  \colon
  C^{k}((X,\{U_i\}),A_\bullet)
  \longrightarrow
  C^{k+1}((X,\{U_i\}),A_\bullet)
$$

is defined componentwise (see at [[matrix calculus]] for conventions on maps between [[direct sums]]) by

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    (d a)_{i_0, \cdots, i_{k+1}} 
    & \coloneqq 
    (\partial_A a + (-1)^k \delta a)_{i_0, \cdots, i_{k+1}} 
    \\
    & \coloneqq
    \partial_A a_{i_0, \cdots, i_{k+1}}
    +
    (-1)^k
    \sum_{0 \leq j \leq k+1} (-1)^{j}
    a_{i_0, \cdots, i_{j-1}, i_{j+1}, \cdots, i_{k+1}} 
    |_{U_{i_0, \cdots, i_{k+1}}}
  \end{aligned}
$$

where on the right the sum is over all components of $a$ obtained via the canonical restrictions obtained by discarding one of the original $(k+1)$ subscripts.

The **Cech cohomology** groups of $X$ with coefficients in $A_\bullet$ __relative to the given cover__ are the [[chain homology]] groups of the Cech complex

$$
  H_{Cech}^k((X,\{U_i\}), A_\bullet)
  \coloneqq
  H^k(C^\bullet((X,\{U_i\}),A_\bullet))
  \,.
$$

The **Cech cohomology** groups as such are the [[colimit]] ("[[direct limit]]") of these groups over refinements of covers

$$
  H^k_{Cech}(X, A_\bullet)
  \coloneqq
  \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_{\{U_i \to X\}}
  H_{Cech}^k((X,\{U_i\}), A_\bullet)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Often Cech cohomology is considered for the case that $A_\bullet$ is concentrated in a single degree, in which case the first term in the sum defining the differential in def. \ref{CechComplex} disappears. 
When $A_\bullet$ is not concentrated in a single degree, then for emphasis one sometimes speaks of _[[hypercohomology]]_. This is the case of relevance for Deligne cohomology.

The Cech chain complex in def. \ref{CechComplex} is the [[total complex]] of the [[double complex]] whose vertical differential is that of $A_\bullet$ and whose horizontal differential is the _Cech differential_ $\delta$ given by alternating sums over restrictions along patch inclusions

###### Remark

For analyzing the properties of Deligne cohomology [below](#Properties), all one needs is the following fact about [[Cech cohomology]], which is discussed for instance at  _[[infinity-cohesive site]]_:

For $X$ a [[smooth manifold]] (in particular [[paracompact topological space|paracompact]]), 

1. $X$ admits a [[good open cover]] $\{U_i \to X\}$ (by [[charts]] $U_i$ all whose finite non-empty intersections are [[diffeomorphism|diffeomorphic]] to an [[open ball]]/[[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$);

1. for any such good open cover the [Cech complex](Čech+cohomology#CechComplex) $C^\bullet((X,\{U_i\}),A_\bullet)$ already computes Cech cohomology (i.e. there is no further need to form the [[colimit]] of Cech complexes over refinements of covers);

1. the functor $C^\bullet((X,\{U_i\}),-) \colon Ch_+(Smooth0Type) \to Ch_+$ preserves weak equivalences and fibrations. 

This means in particular that if $X_\bullet \to Y_\bullet \to Z_\bullet$ is a [[homotopy fiber sequence]] in $Ch_+(Smooth0Type)$, then also 

$$
  C^\bullet((X,\{U_i\}), X_\bullet) 
    \to 
  C^\bullet((X,\{U_i\}), Y_\bullet)
    \to 
  C^\bullet((X,\{U_i\}), Z_\bullet)
$$

is a homotopy fiber sequence of chain complexes, and therefore the [[cohomology groups]] sit in the [[long exact sequence in homology]] of this sequence of chain complexes.

###### Example

For $A_\bullet = (\mathbf{B}^{n+1}\mathbb{Z})_\bullet$ as in example \ref{DeloopingsOfAbelianSheaf}, then for $X$ a [[smooth manifold]] 

$$
  H^0_{Cech}(X, (\mathbf{B}^{n+1}\mathbb{Z})_\bullet)
  \simeq
  H^{n+1}(X,\mathbb{Z})  
$$

is the [[ordinary cohomology]] of $X$ with [[integer]] [[coefficients]], the cohomology which is also computed as the [[singular cohomology]] of the underlying [[topological space]] of $X$.

Similarly for $A_\bullet = (\flat \mathbf{B}^n U(1))_{\bullet}$ then 

$$
  H^0_{Cech}(X, (\flat\mathbf{B}^{n}U(1))_\bullet)
  \simeq
  H^{n}(X,U(1))  
$$

is the [[ordinary cohomology]] of $X$ with [[circle group]] [[coefficients]], the cohomology which is also computed as the [[singular cohomology]] of the underlying [[topological space]] of $X$ with $U(1)$-coefficients.

###### Remark


In def. \ref{TheSmoothDeligneComplex} the de Rham complex is truncated to the right by discarding what would be the next differentials, without passing to their [[kernel]], i.e. in degree 0 the Deligne complex has all differential $n$-forms, not just the closed $n$-fomrs. This simple point is the key aspect of the Deligne complex. If one instead truncates while preserving the chain homology in the lowest degree, then one obtains the following complex with the sheaf $\mathbf{\Omega}^{n}_{cl}$ of _closed_ forms in lowest degree, which gives [[ordinary cohomology]].

### Cup product in Deligne cohomology

For more on this see at _[[Beilinson-Deligne cup-product]]_.




## Properties
  {#Properties}

### Curvature and characteristic classes
 {#CharacteristicMaps}

We discuss the construction of two canonical morphisms out of Deligne cohomology,
and two canonical morphisms into it. Below these are shown to form two interlocking [[exact sequences]] and in fact an exact [[differential cohomology hexagon]] which accurately characterizes Deligne cohomology as the [[differential cohomology]] extension of integral [[ordinary cohomology]] by [[differential forms]].

Throughout, for ease of notation, we assume $n \in \mathbb{N}$ to be positive, 

$$
  n \geq 1
  \,.
$$

The remaining case $n = 0$ describes "circle 0-bundles with connection", which are just $U(1)$-valued functions, and is hence essentially trivial in itself.

in def. \ref{TheSmoothDeligneComplex} is easy enough, all its 
good abstract properties are best understood by realizing that it is the [[homotopy fiber product]] of a kind of higher abelian [[Chern character]] map with the closed differential forms $\mathbf{\Omega}^{n+1}_{cl}$. This is the content of prop. \ref{HomotopyFiberProductCharacterization} below.

###### Definition

Write

$$
  ch_\bullet
   \colon
  (\mathbf{B}^{n+1}\mathbb{Z})_\bullet
  \longrightarrow
  (\flat \mathbf{B}^{n+1}\mathbb{R})_\bullet
$$

for the morphism given as the composite

$$
  (\mathbf{B}^{n+1}\mathbb{Z})_\bullet
  =
  (\flat \mathbf{B}^{n+1}\mathbb{Z})_\bullet
  \longrightarrow
  (\flat \mathbf{B}^{n+1}\mathbb{R})_\bullet
$$

where the second morphism is induced by the canonical inclusion $\mathbb{Z} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}$.

Passing to [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] this induces a morphism

$$
  \array{
    && H^{n+1}(X,\mathbb{R})
    \\
    & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{ch}}
    \\
    H^{n+1}(X,\mathbb{Z})
  }
$$

###### Remark

The morphism in def. \ref{ChernCharacterMap} 
is just the traditional map from [[ordinary cohomology]] with [[integer]] coefficients to that with [[real numbers]] coefficients given for instance via [[singular cohomology]] simply by forming the [[tensor product of abelian groups]] with $\mathbb{R}$. In the broader context of [[differential cohomology]] however it is useful to think of this map as the _[[Chern character]]_, whence the notation.

While this is easy enough to construct in itself, 
the underlying [[chain map]] here is not a fibration in the 
sense of def. \ref{FibrantOnjectStructureOnChSmooth} (having as non-trivial component the inclusion $\mathbb{Z} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}$, which is evidently not an epimorphism). But the [[homotopy fiber]] of this map plays a crucial role in the theory, and so in view of remark \ref{HomotopyFibersViaFactorizationLemma} we consider now a fibration [[resolution]] of this map

1. the left vertical morphism is a weak equivalence;

1. the bottom horizontal morphism $\widehat{ch}_\bullet$ is a fibration.

###### Proof

That the diagram commutes is a straightforward inspection, unwinding the definitions. That $\widehat{ch}_\bullet$ is a fibration according to def. \ref{FibrantOnjectStructureOnChSmooth} is by its very construction, being a [[projection]] in positive degree. That the left morphism is a weak equivalence comes down to the [[Poincaré lemma]], in a slight variant of the simple argument that proves prop. \ref{TheDeRhamResolutionOfConstantFunctions}.

###### Proof

The [[homotopy pullback]] characterization of

implies that the image consists of precisely those closed differential forms
which under the [[de Rham theorem]], remark \ref{DeRhamTheorem}, represent

where $F_{(-)}$ is the [[curvature]] map of def. \ref{CurvatureMap}.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By prop. \ref{ImageOfCurvatureInIntegralDifferentialForms} the
morphism on the right is indeed an epimorphism. 
It remains to determine its [[kernel]]. 

To that end, consider the [[pasting diagram]] of [[homotopy pullbacks]]
obtained form the homotopy pullback in 
prop. \ref{HomotopyFiberProductCharacterization}.
Using the [[pasting law]] and the fact that 
the [[loop space object]] of a 
[[0-truncated]] object such as $\mathbf{\Omega}^{n+1}_{cl}$ is trivial,
this is of the form

$$
  \array{
     0 &\longrightarrow& \widehat{(\flat \mathbf{B}^{n}(\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}))}_\bullet &\longrightarrow& 0

###### Proposition
**(characteristic class exact sequence)**

The Deligne cohomology group fits into a [[short exact sequence]] 
(of [[abelian groups]]) of the form


$$
  0
  \to
  \Omega^{n}(X)/\Omega^n_{int}(X)
  \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}
  H^{n+1}_{conn}(X,\mathbb{Z})
  \stackrel{DD}{\longrightarrow}
  H^{n+1}(X,\mathbb{Z})
  \to 0
$$

where $DD$ is the characteristic class map of
def. \ref{UnderlyingBundleMap}.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The [[chain map]] that represents the [[Dixmier-Douady class]]
by def. \ref{UnderlyingBundleMap} is manifestly 
a fibration in the sense of def. \ref{FibrantOnjectStructureOnChSmooth}.
Therefore its ordinary [[fiber]] is already its [[homotopy fiber]].
That ordinary fiber is evidently the domain of the morphism
constructed in def. \ref{InclusionOfGloballyDefinedConnectionForms},
in its second weakly equivalent incarnation as displayed there.

Therefore the [[long exact sequence in homology]], induced by 
the [[chain map]] $DD_\bullet$ under passage to [[abelian sheaf cohomology]]
(in view of remark \ref{GoodCoverCechCohomologyIsHomotopicallyGood}) goes as

$$
  \cdots
  \longrightarrow
  H^n(X,\mathbb{Z})
  \longrightarrow
  \Omega^n(X)/im(\mathbf{d})
  \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}
  H^{n+1}_{conn}(X,\mathbb{Z})
  \stackrel{DD}{\longrightarrow}
  H^{n+1}(X,\mathbb{Z})
$$

As in the proof of prop. \ref{ImageOfCurvatureInIntegralDifferentialForms}
it follows that the rightmost morphism is an [[epimorphism]]. Hence we get a [[short exact sequence]] by dividing out the image of $H^n(X,\mathbb{Z})$ in $\Omega^n/im(\mathbf{d})$. That image is $\Omega^n_{int}(X)$. Since this image contains $im(\mathbf{d})$ (as the closed differential forms all whose periods are $0 \in \mathbb{N}$ ) the resulting quotient is $\Omega^n(X)/Omega^n_{int}(X)$ and the claim follows.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

In words the statement of prop. \ref{CurvatureExactSequence}
and prop. \ref{CharacteristicClassExactSequence}
is that Deligne [[cohomology groups]]
$H^{n+1}_{conn}(X,\mathbb{Z})$
constitute a [[group extension]] 

1. of integral [[ordinary cohomology]] by differential $n$-forms modulo integral forms;

1. of closed $(n+1)$-forms by $U(1)$-valued ordinary cohomology.

The first statement is what gives the name to "[[differential cohomology]]" as it makes precise how $H^{n+1}_{conn}(X)$ is a combination of ordinary integral cohomology with _[[differential form]]_-data.

The second statement is secretly of the same flavor, if maybe not as manifestly so: the $U(1)$-valued ordinary cohomology is really what classifies _[[flat infinity-connections|flat]]_ [[circle n-connections]] on [[circle n-group]] [[principal infinity-bundles]] (either, depending on perspective, by def. \ref{FlatSmoothDeligneComplex} or else, more intrinsically, by the very statement of prop. \ref{CurvatureExactSequence}) and hence again describes a combination of underlying bundles with differential form data.

such that

###### Proof

For the first statement consider the pasting of homotopy pullback diagrams as in the proof of prop. \ref{CurvatureExactSequence}, now extended to the left,
via the [[pasting law]], as

$$

     \widehat{(\flat \mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{R})}_\bullet &\longrightarrow& \widehat{(\flat \mathbf{B}^{n}(\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}))}_\bullet &\longrightarrow& 0

     &\stackrel{\widehat{ch}_\bullet}{\longrightarrow}&
     \widehat{(\flat \mathbf{B}^{n+1}\mathbb{R})}_\bullet
  }
  \,.

That the NE-diagonal is a homotopy fiber sequence is the statement in the proof
of prop. \ref{CurvatureExactSequence}. That the SE-diagonal is a homotopy fiber sequence follows by inspection as remarked in the proof of prop. \ref{CharacteristicClassExactSequence}.

From this the last statement now is implied by using the [[pasting law]] 
yet once more, as show in the proof [here](differential+cohomology+diagram#TheDifferentialDiagram).

###### Remark

The form of the exact hexagon characterizing the Deligne 
complex via prop. \ref{TheDifferentialHexagonForDeligne}
is in fact a general abstract consequence of the
fact that all universal constructions in $Ch_+(Smooth0Type)$
considered here indeed may be understood as
taking place in the
[[cohesive (∞,1)-topos|cohesive]] [[homotopy theory]] of [[smooth ∞-groupoids]],
via remark \ref{HomotopyPullbacksPreservedbyInclusionIntoAllSmoothHomotopyTypes}.
This is discussed in detail at _[[differential cohomology hexagon]]_.

### GAGA
 {#GAGA}

The Deligne complex is naturally defined in smooth [[differential geometry]] as well as in [[complex analytic geometry]] as well as in [[algebraic geometry]] over the complex numbers. In the spirit of [[GAGA]] it is of interest to know how Deligne cohomology in these different settings relates.

One useful statement is: given an [[smooth scheme|smooth]] [[algebraic variety]] over the [[complex numbers]], then a sufficient condition for a complex-analytic Deligne cocycle over its [[analytification]] to lift to an algebraic Deligne cocycle is that its [[curvature form]] is an [[Kähler form|algebraic form]] ([Esnault 89, corollary 1.3](#Esnault89)). 


### Moduli and deformation theory

The [[moduli spaces]] of holomorphic Deligne cohomology groups
are closely related to [[intermediate Jacobians]], see there fore more.

The [[deformation theory]] of Deligne cohomology groups is given by [[Artin-Mazur formal group]], see there for more

[[!include moduli of higher lines -- table]]


### Interpretation in terms of higher parallel transport

There is a natural way to understand the Deligne complex of sheaves as a sheaf which assigns to each patch the Lie $n$-groupoid of smooth [[higher parallel transport]] [[n-functors]]. 

We start by discussing this in low degree.

There is [[path groupoid]] $P_1(X)$ whose smooth 
space of objects is $X$ and whose smooth space of morphisms is
a space of classes of smooth paths in $X$. 
Every smooth 1-form $A \in \Omega^1(X)$ induces 
a smooth [[functor]] $tra_A : P_1(X) \to \mathbf{B}U(1)$
from $P_1(X)$ to to the smooth [[groupoid]] $\mathbf{B} U(1)$
with one object and $U(1)$ as its smooth space of morphisms
by sending each path $\gamma : [0,1] \to X$
to $\exp (2 \pi i\int_0^1 \gamma^* A)$. This map 
from 1-forms to smooth functors turns out to be bijective:
every smooth functor of this form uniquely arises this way.
Similarly, one finds that smooth [[natural transformation]]
$\eta_f : tra_A \to tra_{A'}$ between two such functors
is in components precisely a 
smooth function $f : X \to U(1)$ such that $A' = A + d log f$.

Since the analogous statements are true for every open subset 
$U \subset X$ this defines a [[sheaf]] of [[Lie groupoid]]s 
$$
  Funct^\infty(P_1(-), \mathbf{B}U(1)) : Op(X)^{op} \to LieGrpd
  \,.
$$
By the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] this sheaf of groupoids
corresponds to a sheaf of complexes of groups. This complex
of sheaves is nothing but the degree 2 Deligne complex

$$
  Funct^\infty(\Pi_1(-), \mathbf{B}U(1)) \simeq \mathbb{Z}(2)^\infty_D
  \,.
$$
 
This way Deligne cohomology is realized as computing the
[[(infinity,1)-sheafification|stackification]] of the pre-stack
$Funct^\infty(P_1(-), \mathbf{B}(1))$ of smooth $U(1)$-valued 
parallel transport functors.

The identification generalizes: for all $n$ there is a [[path n-groupoid]] $P_n(X)$ whose $k$-morphisms are 
$k$-dimensional smooth paths in $X$. Smooth $n$-functors
$tra_C : _n(X) \to \mathbf{B}^n U(1)$ are canonically identified
with smooth $n$-forms $C \in \Omega^n(X)$ and 
under the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] the Deligne-complex in degree
$n+1$ is identified with the sheaf of $n$-groupoids of such smooth 
$n$-functors
$$
  n Funct^\infty(P_n(-), \mathbf{B}^n)
  \simeq
  \mathbb{Z}(n+1)^\infty_D
  \,.

For higher $n$ there is as yet no detailed proof in the literature, but the
low dimensional proofs have obvious generalizations.



## Examples 

As described in some detail at [[electromagnetic field]] in abelian higher [[gauge theory|gauge theories]] the background field naturally arises as a [[Čech cohomology|Čech]]--Deligne cocycle, i.e. a [[Čech cohomology|Čech cocycle]] representative with values in the Deligne complex.

* Degree 2 Deligne cohomology classifies $U(1)$-[[principal bundle]]s [[connection on a bundle|with connection]]. The Deligne complex $\bar \mathbf{B}U(1)$ in this case coincides with the [[groupoid of Lie-algebra valued forms]] for the Lie algebra of $U(1)$.


  * In physics the [[electromagnetic field]] is modeled by a degree 2 Deligne cocycle. See there for a derivation of [[Čech cohomology|Čech]]--Deligne cohomology from physical input.

* Degree 3 Deligne cohomology classifies [[bundle gerbe]]s with connection.

  * In [[electromagnetism]], degree 3 Deligne cocycles (with compact support, possibly) model [[magnetic charge]]. In formal high energy physics the [[Kalb-Ramond field]] is modeled by a Deligne 3-cocycle.

* Degree 4 Deligne cohomology classifies [[bundle 2-gerbe]]s with connection. In particular Chern-Simons bundle 2-gerbes whose degree 4 curvature characteristic class is a multiple of the Pontryagin 4-form on some $SO(n)$-[[principal bundle]]. 

  * In formal high energy physics degree 4 Deligne classes model the [[supergravity C-field]].
