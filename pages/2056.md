## Definition

A __Thomason model category__ is a (Quillen) [[model category]]
such that [[functorial factorizations]] exist.

## Properties

A [[functor category]] with values in a Thomason model category is automatically again a Thomason model category and hence yields a notion of [[global model structure on functors]].

[[Mark Hovey]] later popularized this addition, including the data
of functorial factorizations (and just their existence)
into his definition of a [[model category]].
