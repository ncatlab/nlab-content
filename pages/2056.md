# Idea #

The notion of a _Thomason model category_ is a slight variant of that of a (Quillen) [[model category]]. It is designed to be such that a [[functor category]] with values in a Thomason model category is automatically again a Thomason model category and hence yields a notion of [[global model structure on functors]].
