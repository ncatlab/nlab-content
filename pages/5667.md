## Idea

_KK-theory_ is a "bivariant" joint generalization of [[operator K-theory]] and [[K-homology]]: for $A, B$ two [[C*-algebras]], the _KK-group_ $KK(A,B)$ is a natural [[homotopy]] [[equivalence class]] of $(A,B)$-[[Hilbert bimodules]] equipped with an additional left weak [[Fredholm module]] structure. These KK-groups $KK(A,B)$ behave in the first argument as [[K-homology]] of $A$ and in the second as [[K-cohomology]]/[[operator K-theory]] of $B$.

Abstractly, KK-theory is an [[additive category]] of [[C*-algebras]] which is the split-[[exact functor|exact]] and [[homotopy]]-invariant [[localization]] of [[C*Alg]] at the [[compact operators]]. Hence, abstractly KK-theory is fundamental notion in [[noncommutative topology]], but its standard presentation by [[Fredholm module|Fredolm]]-[[Hilbert bimodules]] as above is rooted in [[functional analysis|functional]] [[analysis]].

Accordingly, KK-theory is a natural home of [[index theory]], for [[elliptic operators]] on [[smooth manifolds]] as well as for their generalization to [[equivariant cohomology|equivariant]] situations, to [[foliations]] and generally to [[Lie groupoid]]-theory (via their [[groupoid convolution C*-algebras]]) and [[noncommutative geometry]].

As a special case of this, [[quantization]] in its incarnation as [[geometric quantization by push-forward]] has been argued to naturally proceed by [[index theory]] in KK-theory ([Landsman 03](#Landsman03), [Bos 07](#Bos07)). Also the coupling of [[D-branes]] and their [[Chan-Paton bundles]] in [[twisted K-theory]] with [[RR-charge]] in [[string theory]] is naturally captured by the coupling between [[K-homology]] and [[K-cohomology]] in KK-theory (e.g. [Szabo 08](#Szabo)).

## Definition

We state first the original and standard definition of $KK$-groups in terms of [[equivalence classes]] of [[Fredholm module|Fredholm]]-[[Hilbert C*-module|Hilbert C*]]-[[Hilbert bimodules|bimodules]] in 

* [In terms of Fredholm Hilbert C-star-bimodules](#InTermsOfFredholmHilbertBimodules)

Then we state the abstract [[category theory|category-theoretic]] characterization by [[localization]] in

* _[Universal category-theoretic characterization](#UniversalCharacterization). 

An equivalent and explicity [[homotopy theory|homotopy theoretic]] characterization akin to that of the standard [[homotopy category]] [[Ho(Top)]] is in  

* [In terms of homotopy classes of star-homomorphisms](#RelationToHomotopyClassesOfStarHomomorphisms).

such that 

1. $\langle -,-\rangle$ behaves indeed like a positive definitine inner product over $B$:

   1. $\langle x,y\rangle^\ast = \langle y,x\rangle$

   1. $\langle x,x\rangle \geq 0$ (in the sense of [[positive elements]] in $B$)

   1. $\langle x,x\rangle = 0$ precisely if $x = 0$;

   1. $\langle x,y \cdot b\rangle = \langle x,y \rangle \cdot b $

1. $H$ is [[complete space|complete]] with respect to the [[norm]]:

   ${\Vert x \Vert_H} \coloneqq {\Vert \langle x,x\rangle\Vert_B}$.

### Relation to homotopy-classes of $\ast$-homomorphisms
 {#RelationToHomotopyClassesOfStarHomomorphisms}

Theorem (Cuntz)

If $A,B$ are [[C-star-algebras]] with $A$ separable and $B$ $\sigma$-unital, then 

$$
  KK(A,B) \simeq [q A, B \otimes \mathcal{K}]
  \,,
$$

where

* $q A$ is the [[kernel]] of the [[codiagonal]] $A \star A \to A$,

* $\mathcal{K}$ is the $C^\ast$-algebra of [[compact operators]].

* $[-,-]$ is the set of [[homotopy]] [[equivalence classes]] of $\ast$-[[homomorphisms]].

(reviewed in ([Joachim-Johnson07](#JoachimJohnson07))).

## Properties


### Relation to operator K-cohomology, K-homology, twisted K-theory
 {#RelationToKCohomologyAndTwistedKTheory}

KK-theory is a joint generalization of [[operator K-theory]], hence also of [[topological K-theory]], as well as of [[K-homology]] and of [[twisted K-theory]].

For $A \in $ [[C*Alg]] we have that 

* $KK(\mathbb{C}, A) \simeq K_0(A)$ 

is the [[operator K-theory]] group of $A$ in degree 0 and

* $KK(C(\mathbb{R}^1),A) \simeq K_1(A)$

is the [[operator K-theory]] group of $A$ in degree 1. (e.g. ([Introduction, p. 20](#Introduction)). If here $A = C(X)$ is the [[C*-algebra]] of functions on a suitable [[topological space]] $X$, then this is the [[topological K-theory]] of that space

* $KK(\mathbb{C}, C(X)) \simeq K^0(X)$

* $KK(C(\mathbb{R}), C(X)) \simeq K^1(X)$.

More generally, if $A = C_r(\mathcal{G}_\bullet)$ is the reduced [[groupoid convolution algebra]] of a [[Lie groupoid]], then 

* $KK(\mathbb{C}, C_r(\mathcal{G}_\bullet)) \simeq K^0(\mathcal{G})$

is the K-theory of the corresponding [[differentiable stack]]. If moreover $c \colon \mathcal{G} \to \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)$ is a [[circle 2-group]]-[[principal 2-bundle]] ($U(1)$-[[bundle gerbe]]) over $\mathcal{X}$ and if $A = C(\mathcal{X}_\bullet, c)$ is the  [[twisted groupoid convolution algebra]] of the corresponding [[centrally extended Lie groupoid]], then 

* $KK(\mathbb{C}, C_r(\mathcal{X}_\bullet,x)) = K^0(\mathcal{X}, c)$ 

is the corresponding [[twisted K-theory]] ([Tu, Xu, Laurent-Gengoux 03](#TXLG)).


On the other hand, with $A$ in the first argument and the complex numbers in the second we have that

* $K(A,\mathbb{C}) \simeq K^0(A)$

ar equivalence classes of $A$-[[Fredholm modules]] and hence the [[K-homology]] of $A$.

(...)

### Relation to extensions

There is an [[isomorphism]]

$KK(A,B) \simeq Ext^1(A,B)$

to a suitable group of suitable [[extensions]] of $A$ by $B$. ([Kasparov 80](#Kasparov80), reviewed in [Inassaridze](#Inassaridze)).

### Triangulated (stable) structure

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

$KK$ is naturally a stable [[triangulated category]].

([Meyer 07](#Meyer), [Uuye 10, theorem 2.29](#Uuye10)).

### Excision and relation to E-theory

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

Given a [[short exact sequence]] of [[C*-algebras]] one says that $KK$ satisfies **[[excision]]** or that it is **excisive** for this sequence if it preserves its [[exact sequence|exactness]] in the middle.

=--

+-- {: .num_example }
###### Example

By theorem \ref{KKIsAdditiveSplitExactLocalizationAtCompacts}, $KK$ is excisive over [[split exact sequences]].

=--

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

$KK$ is excisive for [[nuclear C*-algebras]] in the first argument.

=--

This is discussed ([Kasparov 80, section 7](#Kasparov80)), ([Cuntz-Skandalis 86](#CuntzSkandalis86)).

More generally:

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

$KK$ is excisive for [[K-nuclear C*-algebras]] in the first argument.

=--

([Skandalis 88](#Skandalis88))

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

It is not expected that excision is satisfied fully generally by $KK$. Instead, the [[universal completion|universal]] improvement of $KK$-theory under excision can be constructed. This is called _[[E-theory]]_. See there for more.

=--

### Poincaré duality and Thom isomorphism

+-- {: .num_prop #PoincareDuality}
###### Proposition

Let $X$ be a [[smooth manifold]] which is [[compact topological space|compact]]. Then the [[C*-algebra]] $C(X) \otimes C_0(T^\ast X)$
(the tensor product of the algebra of functions of compact supposer on $X$ and on its [[cotangent bundle]]) is isomorphic, in $KK$, to $\mathbb{C}$:

$$
  d \colon C(X) \otimes C_0(T^\ast X) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}  
  \mathbb{C}
  \,.
$$

=--

([Kasparov 80](#Kasparov80))

+-- {: .num_cor }
###### Corollary

For $X$ a [[compact topological space|compact]] [[smooth manifold]], there is a [[natural isomorphism]] ([[Thom isomorphism]])

$$
  K_0( C_0(T^\ast X))
    \simeq
  KK(\mathbb{C}, C_0(T^\ast X))
    \stackrel{KK(C,(-)\otimes C(X))}{\to}
  KK(C(X), C(X) \otimes C_0(T^\ast X) )
    \underoverset{\simeq}{KK(C(X), d)}{\to}
  KK(C(X), \mathbb{C} )
  \,.
$$

=--




## Further Theorems

* The [[Baum-Connes conjecture]] is naturally formulated within KK-theory.

* The [[Novikov conjecture]] has been verified in many cases using KK-theory. (see for instance [Roseberg 80](#Rosernberg80)).

* The [[Atiyah-Singer index theorem]] is naturally formutaled in KK-theory/[[E-theory]]. (See ([Higson-Roe](#HigsonRoe))).
