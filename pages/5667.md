## Idea

_KK-theory_ is a "bivariant" joint generalization of [[operator K-theory]] and [[K-homology]]: for $A, B$ two [[C*-algebras]], the _KK-group_ $KK(A,B)$ is a natural [[homotopy]] [[equivalence class]] of $(A,B)$-[[Hilbert bimodules]] equipped with an additional left weak [[Fredholm module]] structure. These KK-groups $KK(A,B)$ behave in the first argument as [[K-homology]] of $A$ and in the second as [[K-cohomology]]/[[operator K-theory]] of $B$.

Abstractly, KK-theory is an [[additive category]] of [[C*-algebras]] which is the split-[[exact functor|exact]] and [[homotopy]]-invariant [[localization]] of [[C*Alg]] at the [[compact operators]]. Hence, abstractly KK-theory is fundamental notion in [[noncommutative topology]], but its standard presentation by [[Fredholm module|Fredolm]]-[[Hilbert bimodules]] as above is rooted in [[functional analysis|functional]] [[analysis]].

Accordingly, KK-theory is a natural home of [[index theory]], for [[elliptic operators]] on [[smooth manifolds]] as well as for their generalization to [[equivariant cohomology|equivariant]] situations, to [[foliations]] and generally to [[Lie groupoid]]-theory (via their [[groupoid convolution C*-algebras]]) and [[noncommutative geometry]].

As a special case of this, [[quantization]] in its incarnation as [[geometric quantization by push-forward]] has been argued to naturally proceed by [[index theory]] in KK-theory ([Landsman 03](#Landsman03), [Bos 07](#Bos07)). Also the coupling of [[D-branes]] and their [[Chan-Paton bundles]] in [[twisted K-theory]] with [[RR-charge]] in [[string theory]] is naturally captured by the coupling between [[K-homology]] and [[K-cohomology]] in KK-theory (e.g. [Szabo 08](#Szabo)).

## Definition

We state first the original and standard definition of $KK$-groups in terms of [[equivalence classes]] of [[Fredholm module|Fredholm]]-[[Hilbert C*-module|Hilbert C*]]-[[Hilbert bimodules|bimodules]] in 

* [In terms of Fredholm Hilbert C-star-bimodules](#InTermsOfFredholmHilbertBimodules)

Then we state the abstract [[category theory|category-theoretic]] characterization by [[localization]] in

* _[Universal category-theoretic characterization](#UniversalCharacterization). 

An equivalent and explicity [[homotopy theory|homotopy theoretic]] characterization akin to that of the standard [[homotopy category]] [[Ho(Top)]] is in  

* [In terms of homotopy classes of star-homomorphisms](#RelationToHomotopyClassesOfStarHomomorphisms).

### Relation to homotopy-classes of $\ast$-homomorphisms
 {#RelationToHomotopyClassesOfStarHomomorphisms}

Theorem (Cuntz)

If $A,B$ are [[C-star-algebras]] with $A$ separable and $B$ $\sigma$-unital, then 

$$
  KK(A,B) \simeq [q A, B \otimes \mathcal{K}]
  \,,
$$

where

* $q A$ is the [[kernel]] of the [[codiagonal]] $A \star A \to A$,

* $\mathcal{K}$ is the $C^\ast$-algebra of [[compact operators]].

* $[-,-]$ is the set of [[homotopy]] [[equivalence classes]] of $\ast$-[[homomorphisms]].

(reviewed in ([Joachim-Johnson07](#JoachimJohnson07))).

## Properties


### Relation to extensions

There is an [[isomorphism]]

$KK(A,B) \simeq Ext^1(A,B)$

to a suitable group of suitable [[extensions]] of $A$ by $B$. ([Kasparov 80](#Kasparov80), reviewed in [Inassaridze](#Inassaridze)).


### Relation to operator K-cohomology, K-homology, twisted K-theory
 {#RelationToKCohomologyAndTwistedKTheory}

KK-theory is a joint generalization of [[operator K-theory]], hence also of [[topological K-theory]], as well as of [[K-homology]] and of [[twisted K-theory]].

For $A \in $ [[C*Alg]] we have that 

* $KK(\mathbb{C}, A) \simeq K_0(A)$ 

is the [[operator K-theory]] group of $A$ in degree 0 and

* $KK(C(\mathbb{R}^1),A) \simeq K_1(A)$

is the [[operator K-theory]] group of $A$ in degree 1. If here $A = C(X)$ is the [[C*-algebra]] of functions on a suitable [[topological space]] $X$, then this is the [[topological K-theory]] of that space

* $KK(\mathbb{C}, C(X)) \simeq K^0(X)$

* $KK(C(\mathbb{R}), C(X)) \simeq K^1(X)$.

More generally, if $A = C_r(\mathcal{G}_\bullet)$ is the reduced [[groupoid convolution algebra]] of a [[Lie groupoid]], then 

* $KK(\mathbb{C}, C_r(\mathcal{G}_\bullet)) \simeq K^0(\mathcal{G})$

is the K-theory of the corresponding [[differentiable stack]]. If moreover $c \colon \mathcal{G} \to \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)$ is a [[circle 2-group]]-[[principal 2-bundle]] ($U(1)$-[[bundle gerbe]]) over $\mathcal{X}$ and if $A = C(\mathcal{X}_\bullet, c)$ is the  [[twisted groupoid convolution algebra]] of the corresponding [[centrally extended Lie groupoid]], then 

* $KK(\mathbb{C}, C_r(\mathcal{X}_\bullet,x)) = K^0(\mathcal{X}, c)$ 

is the corresponding [[twisted K-theory]] ([Tu, Xu, Laurent-Gengoux 03](#TXLG)).


On the other hand, with $A$ in the first argument and the complex numbers in the second we have that

* $K(A,\mathbb{C}) \simeq K^0(A)$

ar equivalence classes of $A$-[[Fredholm modules]] and hence the [[K-homology]] of $A$.

(...)

## Theorems

* The [[Baum-Connes conjecture]] is naturally formulated within KK-theory.

* The [[Novikov conjecture]] has been verified in many cases using KK-theory. (see for instance [Roseberg 80](#Rosernberg80)).

### In Category theory and Homotopy theory

KK-theory is naturally understood in terms of [[universal properties]] in [[category theory]] and in [[homotopy theory]].

That $KK(A,B)$ is naturally thought of as a collection of "generalized [[homomorphisms]]" of $C^\ast$-algebras was amplified in

* [[Joachim Cuntz]], _K-theory and C*-algebras_, Springer Lecture Notes in Mathematics, 1046 (1984), 55-79.

That under the Kasparov product these are indeed the [[hom-objects]] in a [[category]] was first observed in 

* [[Nigel Higson]], _A characterization of KK-theory_,  Pacific J. Math. Volume 126, Number 2 (1987), 253-276. ([EUCLID](http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.pjm/1102699804))

where moreover this category is realized as the [[universal property|universal]] additive and split exact "[[localization]]" of $C^\ast Alg$ at the $C^\ast$-algebra of [[compact operators]].
