## Idea

_KK-theory_ is a "[[bivariant cohomology theory|bivariant]]" joint generalization of [[operator K-theory]] and [[K-homology]]: for $A, B$ two [[C*-algebras]], the _KK-group_ $KK(A,B)$ is a natural [[homotopy]] [[equivalence class]] of $(A,B)$-[[Hilbert bimodules]] equipped with an additional left weak [[Fredholm module]] structure. These KK-groups $KK(A,B)$ behave in the first argument as [[K-homology]] of $A$ and in the second as [[K-cohomology]]/[[operator K-theory]] of $B$.

Abstractly, KK-theory is an [[additive category]] of [[C*-algebras]] which is the split-[[exact functor|exact]] and [[homotopy]]-invariant [[localization]] of [[C*Alg]] at the [[compact operators]]. Hence, abstractly KK-theory is a fundamental notion in [[noncommutative topology]], but its standard presentation by [[Fredholm module|Fredolm]]-[[Hilbert bimodules]] as above is rooted in [[functional analysis|functional]] [[analysis]]. A slight variant of this localization process is called _[[E-theory]]_.

Due to this joint root in [[functional analysis]] and ([[noncommutative topology|noncommutative]]) [[cohomology]]/[[homotopy theory]] ("[[noncommutative stable homotopy theory]]"), KK-theory is a natural home of [[index theory]], for [[elliptic operators]] on [[smooth manifolds]] as well as for their generalization to [[equivariant cohomology|equivariant]] situations, to [[foliations]] and generally to [[Lie groupoid]]-theory (via their [[groupoid convolution C*-algebras]]) and [[noncommutative geometry]].

As a special case of this, [[quantization]] in its incarnation as [[geometric quantization by push-forward]] has been argued to naturally proceed by [[index theory]] in KK-theory ([Landsman 03](#Landsman03), [Bos 07](#Bos07)). Also the coupling of [[D-branes]] and their [[Chan-Paton bundles]] in [[twisted K-theory]] with [[RR-charge]] in [[string theory]] is naturally captured by the coupling between [[K-homology]] and [[K-cohomology]] in KK-theory (e.g. [Szabo 08](#Szabo)).

## Definition

We state first the original and standard definition of $KK$-groups in terms of [[equivalence classes]] of [[Fredholm module|Fredholm]]-[[Hilbert C*-module|Hilbert C*]]-[[Hilbert bimodules|bimodules]] in 

* [In terms of Fredholm Hilbert C-star-bimodules](#InTermsOfFredholmHilbertBimodules)

Then we state the abstract [[category theory|category-theoretic]] characterization by [[localization]] in

* _[Universal category-theoretic characterization](#UniversalCharacterization). 

An equivalent and explicity [[homotopy theory|homotopy theoretic]] characterization akin to that of the standard [[homotopy category]] [[Ho(Top)]] is in  

* [In terms of homotopy classes of star-homomorphisms](#RelationToHomotopyClassesOfStarHomomorphisms).

   1. $\langle x,y\rangle^\ast = \langle y,x\rangle$

   1. $\langle x,x\rangle \geq 0$ (in the sense of [[positive elements]] in $B$)

   1. $\langle x,y \cdot b\rangle = \langle x,y \rangle \cdot b $

1. $H$ is [[complete space|complete]] with respect to the [[norm]]:

   ${\Vert x \Vert_H} \coloneqq {\Vert \langle x,x\rangle\Vert_B}$.

On the other hand, at least between $C^\ast$-algebras which are [[algebras of functions]] on [[smooth manifolds]]  $A_i = C(X_i)$ , KK-classes are presented by [[correspondences]] $X_1 \leftarrow Z \to X_2$ and the Kasparov product is given just by the [[fiber product]]-composition operation on correspondences ([Connes-Skandalis 84, theorem 3.2](#ConnesSkandalis84), [Block-Weinberger 99, section 3](#BlockWeinberger99)).

### Universal category-theoretic characterization
 {#UniversalCharacterization}

+-- {: .num_prop #KasparovProductIsAssociative}
###### Proposition

The Kasparov product, def. \ref{KasparovProduct}, is [[associativity|associtative]]. Thus under the Kasparov product

$$
  KK(-,-) \;\colon\; C^\ast Alg \times C^\ast Alg \to C^\ast Alg
$$

is the [[hom-functor]] of an [[additive category]]. 

=--

([Higson 87, theorem 4.1](#Higson))


The category $KK$ is a kind of [[localization]] of the category of [[C-star-algebras]]:

+-- {: .num_theorem #KKIsAdditiveSplitExactLocalizationAtCompacts}
###### Theorem

The canonical functor

$$
  Q \colon C^\ast Alg \to KK
$$

exhibits $KK$ as the [[universal property|universal category]] receiving a functor from [[C*-algebras]] such that

1. $KK$ is an [[additive category]];

1. $Q$ is homotopy-invariant;

1. $Q$ [[isomorphism|inverts]] the [[tensor product]] with the [[C*-algebra]] of [[compact operators]]

   (for all $C^\ast$-homomorphisms of the form $id \otimes e \langle e,- \rangle \;\colon A\; \to A \otimes \mathcal{K}$ the morphism $Q(id \otimes e \langle e)$ is an [[isomorphism]]).

1. $Q$ preserves [[split short exact sequences]].

=--

This is due to ([Higson 87, theorem 4.5](#Higson)). The generalization to the equivariant case is due to ([Thomsen 98](#Thomsen98)).

###### Remark

The localization conditions here are analogous to those that define the localization of [[stable (infinity,1)-categories]] to [[noncommutative motives]] (see there for more).

+-- {: .num_cor }
###### Corollary

The minimal [[tensor product of C-star-algebras]]

$$
  \otimes \colon C^\ast Alg \times C^\ast Alg \to C^\ast Alg
$$

extends uniquely to a [[tensor product]] $\otimes_{KK}$ on $KK$ such that there is a [[commuting diagram]] of [[functors]]

$$
  \array{
    C^\ast Alg \times C^\ast Alg &\stackrel{Q \times Q}{\to}& KK
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\otimes}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\otimes_{KK}}}
    \\
    C^\ast Alg &\stackrel{Q}{\to}& KK
  }
  \,.

### In terms of homotopy-classes of $\ast$-homomorphisms
 {#RelationToHomotopyClassesOfStarHomomorphisms}

Theorem (Cuntz)

If $A,B$ are [[C-star-algebras]] with $A$ separable and $B$ $\sigma$-unital, then 

$$
  KK(A,B) \simeq [q A, B \otimes \mathcal{K}]
  \,,
$$

where

* $q A$ is the [[kernel]] of the [[codiagonal]] $A \star A \to A$,

* $\mathcal{K}$ is the $C^\ast$-algebra of [[compact operators]].

* $[-,-]$ is the set of [[homotopy]] [[equivalence classes]] of $\ast$-[[homomorphisms]].

(reviewed in ([Joachim-Johnson07](#JoachimJohnson07))).

### In terms of correspondences/spans of groupoids
 {#InTermsOfCorrespondences}


At least to some extent, KK-classes between [[C*-algebras]] of [[continuous functions]] on manifolds/spaces, and maybe more generally between [[groupoid convolution algebras]] can be represented by certain [[equivalence classes]] of [[spans]]/[[correspondences]] 

$$
  X \leftarrow (Z,E) \to Y
$$

of such [[spaces]].

See the corresponding [references below](#ReferencesInTermsOfCorrespondences).

Such a description by abelianizations of [[correspondences]] is reminiscent of similar constructions of [[motivic cohomology]]. See [below](#AsAnAnalogOfMotives).

### As an analog of motives in noncommutative topology
 {#AsAnAnalogOfMotives}

To some extent [[KK-theory]]/[[E-theory]] look like an analogue in [[noncommutative topology]] of what in [[algebraic geometry]] is the category of [[motives]]. ([Connes-Consani-Marcolli 05](#ConnesConsaniMarcolli05)). ([Meyer 06](#Meyer06)). 

Specifically the characterization in terms of spans/correspondences [above](#InTermsOfCorrespondences) is reminiscent to the definition of [[Chow motives]]. A relation between bivariant [[algebraic K-theory]] and [[motivic cohomology]] is discussed in ([Garkusha-Panin 11](#GarkushaPanin11)).

## Properties


### Relation to operator K-cohomology, K-homology, twisted K-theory
 {#RelationToKCohomologyAndTwistedKTheory}

KK-theory is a joint generalization of [[operator K-theory]], hence also of [[topological K-theory]], as well as of [[K-homology]] and of [[twisted K-theory]].

For $A \in $ [[C*Alg]] we have that 

* $KK(\mathbb{C}, A) \simeq K_0(A)$ 

is the [[operator K-theory]] group of $A$ in degree 0 and

* $KK(C(\mathbb{R}^1),A) \simeq K_1(A)$

is the [[operator K-theory]] group of $A$ in degree 1. (e.g. ([Introduction, p. 20](#Introduction)). If here $A = C(X)$ is the [[C*-algebra]] of functions on a suitable [[topological space]] $X$, then this is the [[topological K-theory]] of that space

* $KK(\mathbb{C}, C(X)) \simeq K^0(X)$

* $KK(C(\mathbb{R}), C(X)) \simeq K^1(X)$.

More generally, if $A = C_r(\mathcal{G}_\bullet)$ is the reduced [[groupoid convolution algebra]] of a [[Lie groupoid]], then 

* $KK(\mathbb{C}, C_r(\mathcal{G}_\bullet)) \simeq K^0(\mathcal{G})$

is the K-theory of the corresponding [[differentiable stack]]. If moreover $c \colon \mathcal{G} \to \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)$ is a [[circle 2-group]]-[[principal 2-bundle]] ($U(1)$-[[bundle gerbe]]) over $\mathcal{X}$ and if $A = C(\mathcal{X}_\bullet, c)$ is the  [[twisted groupoid convolution algebra]] of the corresponding [[centrally extended Lie groupoid]], then 

* $KK(\mathbb{C}, C_r(\mathcal{X}_\bullet,x)) = K^0(\mathcal{X}, c)$ 

is the corresponding [[twisted K-theory]] ([Tu, Xu, Laurent-Gengoux 03](#TXLG)).


On the other hand, with $A$ in the first argument and the complex numbers in the second we have that

* $K(A,\mathbb{C}) \simeq K^0(A)$

ar equivalence classes of $A$-[[Fredholm modules]] and hence the [[K-homology]] of $A$.

(...)

### Relation to extensions

There is an [[isomorphism]]

$KK(A,B) \simeq Ext^1(A,B)$

to a suitable group of suitable [[extensions]] of $A$ by $B$. ([Kasparov 80](#Kasparov80), reviewed in [Inassaridze](#Inassaridze)).

### Triangulated (stable) structure

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

$KK$ is naturally a stable [[triangulated category]].

=--

([Meyer 07](#Meyer), [Uuye 10, theorem 2.29](#Uuye10)).

### Excision and relation to E-theory

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

Given a [[short exact sequence]] of [[C*-algebras]] one says that $KK$ satisfies **[[excision]]** or that it is **excisive** for this sequence if it preserves its [[exact sequence|exactness]] in the middle.

=--

+-- {: .num_example }
###### Example

By theorem \ref{KKIsAdditiveSplitExactLocalizationAtCompacts}, $KK$ is excisive over [[split exact sequences]].

=--

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

$KK$ is excisive for [[nuclear C*-algebras]] in the first argument.

=--

This is discussed ([Kasparov 80, section 7](#Kasparov80)), ([Cuntz-Skandalis 86](#CuntzSkandalis86)).

More generally:

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

$KK$ is excisive for [[K-nuclear C*-algebras]] in the first argument.

=--

([Skandalis 88](#Skandalis88))

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

It is not expected that excision is satisfied fully generally by $KK$. Instead, the [[universal property|universal]] improvement of $KK$-theory under excision can be constructed. This is called _[[E-theory]]_. See there for more.

=--

### Poincaré duality and Thom isomorphism

+-- {: .num_prop #PoincareDuality}
###### Proposition

Let $X$ be a [[smooth manifold]] which is [[compact topological space|compact]]. Then the [[C*-algebra]] $C(X) \otimes C_0(T^\ast X)$
(the tensor product of the algebra of functions of compact supposer on $X$ and on its [[cotangent bundle]]) is isomorphic, in $KK$, to $\mathbb{C}$:

$$
  d \colon C(X) \otimes C_0(T^\ast X) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}  
  \mathbb{C}
  \,.
$$

=--

([Kasparov 80](#Kasparov80))

+-- {: .num_cor }
###### Corollary

For $X$ a [[compact topological space|compact]] [[smooth manifold]], there is a [[natural isomorphism]] ([[Thom isomorphism]])

$$
  K_0( C_0(T^\ast X))
    \simeq
  KK(\mathbb{C}, C_0(T^\ast X))
    \stackrel{KK(C,(-)\otimes C(X))}{\to}
  KK(C(X), C(X) \otimes C_0(T^\ast X) )
    \underoverset{\simeq}{KK(C(X), d)}{\to}
  KK(C(X), \mathbb{C} )
  \,.
$$

=--




## Further Theorems

* The [[Baum-Connes conjecture]] is naturally formulated within KK-theory.

* The [[Novikov conjecture]] has been verified in many cases using KK-theory. (see for instance [Roseberg 80](#Rosernberg80)).

* The [[Atiyah-Singer index theorem]] is naturally formutaled in KK-theory/[[E-theory]]. (See ([Higson-Roe](#HigsonRoe))).

KK-theory is naturally understood in terms of [[universal properties]] in [[category theory]] and in [[homotopy theory]].

where moreover this category is realized as the [[universal property|universal]] additive and split exact "[[localization]]" of $C^\ast Alg$ at the $C^\ast$-algebra of [[compact operators]].

### In terms of correspondences/spans
 {#ReferencesInTermsOfCorrespondences}

KK-classes between [[algebras of functions]] on [[smooth manifolds]] are described in terms of [[equivalence classes]] of [[correspondence]] manifolds carrying a [[vector bundle]] in section 3 of

* [[Alain Connes]], [[Georges Skandalis]], _The longitudinal index theorem for foliations_. Publ. Res. Inst. Math. Sci. 20,
no. 6, 1139–1183 (1984) ([pdf](http://www.alainconnes.org/docs/longitudinal.pdf))
 {#ConnesSkandalis84}

This generalizes the [[Baum-Douglas geometric cycles]] from [[K-homology]] to KK-theory.

A further generalization of this, where one algebra $C(Y)$ is generalized to $C(Y) \otimes A$ for $A$ a unital separable $C^\ast$-algebra, is in section 3 of

* [[Jonathan Block]], [[Shmuel Weinberger]], _Arithmetic manifolds of positive scalar curvature._, J. Diff. Geom. 52, no. 2, 375–406 (1999). ([web](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.30.297))
 {#BlockWeinberger99}

In section 5 of

* [[Jacek Brodzki]], [[Varghese Mathai]], [[Jonathan Rosenberg]], [[Richard Szabo]], _Noncommutative correspondences, duality and D-branes in bivariant K-theory_, Adv. Theor. Math. Phys.13:497-552,2009 ([arXiv:0708.2648](http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.2648))

this is reviewed and then a characterization in terms of [[co-spans]] of [[C*-algebras]] is given. This version is effectively a restatement of [the characterization by Cuntz](#RelationToHomotopyClassesOfStarHomomorphisms) as reproduced in ([Blackadar 99, corollary 17.8.4](#Blackadar99)).

Similar [[correspondence]]-presentation of [[equivariant cohomology|equivariant]] KK-theory -- hence at least of something close to KK-classes between [[groupoid algebras]] of [[action groupoids]] -- was introduced in 

* [[Heath Emerson]], [[Ralf Meyer]], _Dualities in equivariant Kasparov theory_ ([arXiv:0711.0025](http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.0025))

Further developments of this are in 

* [[Heath Emerson]], _Duality, correspondences and the Lefschetz map in equivariant KK-theory: a survey_ ([arXiv:0904.4744](http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.4744))

* [[Heath Emerson]], Robert Yuncken, _Equivariant correspondences and the Borel-Bott-Weil theorem_ ([arXiv:0905.1153](http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.1153))

### Relation to motives and algebraic KK-theory
 {#RelationToMotives}

The general analogy between KK-cocycles and [[motives]] is noted explicitly in 

* [[Alain Connes]], Caterina Consani, [[Matilde Marcolli]], _Noncommutative geometry and motives: the thermodynamics of endomotives_ ([arXiv:math/0512138](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0512138))

and also very briefly in ([Meyer 06](#Meyer06)).  

A relation between [[motivic cohomology]] and bivariant [[algebraic K-theory]] is discussed in

### In D-brane theory

KK-theory also describes [[RR-field]] [[charges]] and sources in [[D-brane]] theory.
