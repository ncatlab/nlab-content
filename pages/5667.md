
KK-theory is a bivariant version of the [[K-theory]] of [[operator algebras]] introduced by Gennady Kasparov in 1980: he introduced groups $KK(A,B)$ which are now viewed as a "correct" hom-set among noncommutative operator algebras for the purpose of various homotopy-invariant functors. Kasparov's work has been prompted by the advances in [[Brown-Douglas-Fillmore theory]], especially in the last 1977 article.

Abstract: By introducing a notion of smooth connection for unbounded $KK$-cycles, we show that the Kasparov product of such cycles can be defined directly, by an algebraic formula. In order to achieve this it is necessary to develop a framework of smooth algebras and a notion of differentiable $C^{*}$-module. The theory of operator spaces provides the required tools. Finally, the above mentioned $KK$-cycles with connection can be viewed as the morphisms in a category whose objects are spectral triples.
