## Idea

_KK-theory_ is a "[[bivariant cohomology theory|bivariant]]" joint generalization of [[operator K-theory]] and [[K-homology]]: for $A, B$ two [[C*-algebras]], the _KK-group_ $KK(A,B)$ is a natural [[homotopy]] [[equivalence class]] of $(A,B)$-[[Hilbert bimodules]] equipped with an additional left weak [[Fredholm module]] structure. These KK-groups $KK(A,B)$ behave in the first argument as [[K-homology]] of $A$ and in the second as [[K-cohomology]]/[[operator K-theory]] of $B$.

Abstractly, KK-theory is an [[additive category]] of [[C*-algebras]] which is the split-[[exact functor|exact]] and [[homotopy]]-invariant [[localization]] of [[C*Alg]] at the [[compact operators]]. Hence, abstractly KK-theory is a fundamental notion in [[noncommutative topology]], but its standard presentation by [[Fredholm module|Fredolm]]-[[Hilbert bimodules]] as above is rooted in [[functional analysis|functional]] [[analysis]]. A slight variant of this localization process is called _[[E-theory]]_.

Due to this joint root in [[functional analysis]] and ([[noncommutative topology|noncommutative]]) [[cohomology]]/[[homotopy theory]] ("[[noncommutative stable homotopy theory]]"), KK-theory is a natural home of [[index theory]], for [[elliptic operators]] on [[smooth manifolds]] as well as for their generalization to [[equivariant cohomology|equivariant]] situations, to [[foliations]] and generally to [[Lie groupoid]]-theory (via their [[groupoid convolution C*-algebras]]) and [[noncommutative geometry]].

As a special case of this, [[quantization]] in its incarnation as [[geometric quantization by push-forward]] has been argued to naturally proceed by [[index theory]] in KK-theory ([Landsman 03](#Landsman03), [Bos 07](#Bos07)). Also the coupling of [[D-branes]] and their [[Chan-Paton bundles]] in [[twisted K-theory]] with [[RR-charge]] in [[string theory]] is naturally captured by the coupling between [[K-homology]] and [[K-cohomology]] in KK-theory (e.g. [Szabo 08](#Szabo)).

## Definition

We state first the original and standard definition of $KK$-groups in terms of [[equivalence classes]] of [[Fredholm module|Fredholm]]-[[Hilbert C*-module|Hilbert C*]]-[[Hilbert bimodules|bimodules]] in 

* [In terms of Fredholm Hilbert C-star-bimodules](#InTermsOfFredholmHilbertBimodules)

Then we state the abstract [[category theory|category-theoretic]] characterization by [[localization]] in

* _[Universal category-theoretic characterization](#UniversalCharacterization). 

An equivalent and explicity [[homotopy theory|homotopy theoretic]] characterization akin to that of the standard [[homotopy category]] [[Ho(Top)]] is in  

* [In terms of homotopy classes of star-homomorphisms](#RelationToHomotopyClassesOfStarHomomorphisms).

###### Definition

In all of the following, "$C^\ast$-algebra" means _[[separable topological space|separable]]_ [[C*-algebra]]. We write [[C*Alg]] for 
for the [[category]] whose [[objects]] are separable $C^\ast$-algebras and whose [[morphisms]] are $\ast$-[[homomorphisms]] between these.

###### Example

We write

###### Definition

For $B \in $ [[C*Alg]], a [[Hilbert C*-module]] over $B$ is 

1. a [[complex numbers|complex]] [[vector space]] $H$;

1. equipped with a [[C*-representation]] of $B$ from the right;

1. equipped with a [[sesquilinear map]] (linear in the second argument)

   $$
     \langle -,-\rangle \colon H \times H \to B
   $$

   (the $B$-valued [[inner product]])

such that 

1. $\langle -,-\rangle$ behaves indeed like a positive definitine inner product over $B$:

   1. $\langle x,y\rangle^\ast = \langle y,x\rangle$

   1. $\langle x,x\rangle \geq 0$ (in the sense of [[positive elements]] in $B$)

   1. $\langle x,x\rangle = 0$ precisely if $x = 0$;

   1. $\langle x,y \cdot b\rangle = \langle x,y \rangle \cdot b $

1. $H$ is [[complete space|complete]] with respect to the [[norm]]:

   ${\Vert x \Vert_H} \coloneqq {\Vert \langle x,x\rangle\Vert_B}$.

###### Definition

For $A,B \in C^\ast Alg$ an $(A,B)$-[[Hilbert C*-bimodule]] is an $B$-[[Hilbert C*-module]], def. \ref{HilbertCStarModule} $(H, \langle \rangle)$ equipped with a [[C-star representation]] of $A$ from the left such that all $a \in A$ are "adjointable" in the $B$-valued inner product, meaning that

For $A, B \in $ [[C*Alg]], **Kasparov $(A,B)$-bimodule**
is a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-[[graded vector space|graded]] $(A,B)$-[[Hilbert bimodules]] $\mathcal{H}, \langle -,-\rangle$, def. \ref{HilbertBimodule}, equipped with an adjointable odd-graded [[bounded operator]] $F \in \mathcal{B}_A(\mathcal{H})$ such that 

1. $(F^2 - 1)\pi(a) \in \mathcal{K}_A(\mathcal{H})$ 

1. $[F, \pi(a)] \in \mathcal{K}_A(\mathcal{H})$ 

1. $(F - F^\ast) \pi(a)\in \mathcal{K}_A(\mathcal{H})$

for all $a \in A$,

hence such that $F$ squares to the identity, commutes with multiplication operators and is self-adjoint _up to_ [[compact operators]].

###### Proposition

There is a composition operation

$$
  KK(A,B) \times KK(B,C) \to KK(A,C)
$$

such that (...). This is called the **Kasparov product**.

A streamlined version of the definition of the Kasparov product is in ([Skandalis 84](#Skandalis84)). 

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

From the point of view of [[E-theory]] the Kasparov product is equivalently just the composition of homotopy classes of completely poistive [[asymptotic C*-homomorphisms]]. See at _[[E-theory]]_ for more on this.

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

On the other hand, at least between $C^\ast$-algebras which are [[algebras of functions]] on [[smooth manifolds]]  $A_i = C(X_i)$ , KK-classes are presented by [[correspondences]] $X_1 \leftarrow Z \to X_2$ and the Kasparov product is given just by the [[fiber product]]-composition operation on correspondences ([Connes-Skandalis 84, theorem 3.2](#ConnesSkandalis84), [Block-Weinberger 99, section 3](#BlockWeinberger99)).

### Universal category-theoretic characterization
 {#UniversalCharacterization}

+-- {: .num_prop #KasparovProductIsAssociative}
###### Proposition

The Kasparov product, def. \ref{KasparovProduct}, is [[associativity|associtative]]. Thus under the Kasparov product

$$
  KK(-,-) \;\colon\; C^\ast Alg \times C^\ast Alg \to C^\ast Alg
$$

is the [[hom-functor]] of an [[additive category]]. 

=--

([Higson 87, theorem 4.1](#Higson))


The category $KK$ is a kind of [[localization]] of the category of [[C-star-algebras]]:

+-- {: .num_theorem #KKIsAdditiveSplitExactLocalizationAtCompacts}
###### Theorem

The canonical functor

$$
  Q \colon C^\ast Alg \to KK
$$

exhibits $KK$ as the [[universal property|universal category]] receiving a functor from [[C*-algebras]] such that

1. $KK$ is an [[additive category]];

1. $Q$ is homotopy-invariant;

1. $Q$ [[isomorphism|inverts]] the [[tensor product]] with the [[C*-algebra]] of [[compact operators]]

   (for all $C^\ast$-homomorphisms of the form $id \otimes e \langle e,- \rangle \;\colon A\; \to A \otimes \mathcal{K}$ the morphism $Q(id \otimes e \langle e)$ is an [[isomorphism]]).

1. $Q$ preserves [[split short exact sequences]].

=--

This is due to ([Higson 87, theorem 4.5](#Higson)). The generalization to the equivariant case is due to ([Thomsen 98](#Thomsen98)).

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

The localization conditions here are analogous to those that define the localization of [[stable (âˆž,1)-categories]] to [[noncommutative motives]] (see there for more).

###### Corollary

The minimal [[tensor product of C-star-algebras]]

$$
  \otimes \colon C^\ast Alg \times C^\ast Alg \to C^\ast Alg
$$

extends uniquely to a [[tensor product]] $\otimes_{KK}$ on $KK$ such that there is a [[commuting diagram]] of [[functors]]

$$
  \array{
    C^\ast Alg \times C^\ast Alg &\stackrel{Q \times Q}{\to}& KK
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\otimes}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\otimes_{KK}}}
    \\
    C^\ast Alg &\stackrel{Q}{\to}& KK
  }
  \,.

### In terms of homotopy-classes of $\ast$-homomorphisms
 {#RelationToHomotopyClassesOfStarHomomorphisms}

Theorem (Cuntz)

If $A,B$ are [[C-star-algebras]] with $A$ separable and $B$ $\sigma$-unital, then 

$$
  KK(A,B) \simeq [q A, B \otimes \mathcal{K}]
  \,,
$$

where

* $q A$ is the [[kernel]] of the [[codiagonal]] $A \star A \to A$,

* $\mathcal{K}$ is the $C^\ast$-algebra of [[compact operators]].

* $[-,-]$ is the set of [[homotopy]] [[equivalence classes]] of $\ast$-[[homomorphisms]].

(reviewed in ([Joachim-Johnson07](#JoachimJohnson07))).

### In terms of correspondences/spans of groupoids
 {#InTermsOfCorrespondences}


At least to some extent, KK-classes between [[C*-algebras]] of [[continuous functions]] on manifolds/spaces, and maybe more generally between [[groupoid convolution algebras]] can be represented by certain [[equivalence classes]] of [[spans]]/[[correspondences]] 

$$
  X \leftarrow (Z,E) \to Y
$$

of such [[spaces]].

See the corresponding [references below](#ReferencesInTermsOfCorrespondences).

Such a description by abelianizations of [[correspondences]] is reminiscent of similar constructions of [[motivic cohomology]]. See [below](#AsAnAnalogOfMotives). For more on this see also the pointers at at _[[motivic quantization]]_.

* category of equivariant correspondences equipped with cocycle: $\hat F_{\mathcal{G}}^\ast$ (theorem 2.26);

* specifically for K-theory cocycles: $\widehat {KK}_{\mathcal{G}}^\ast$  (section 4, page 27)

* pull-push from correspondences to KK in proof of theorem 4.2, bottom of p. 27

### As an analog of motives in noncommutative topology
 {#AsAnAnalogOfMotives}

To some extent [[KK-theory]]/[[E-theory]] look like an analogue in [[noncommutative topology]] of what in [[algebraic geometry]] is the category of [[motives]]. ([Connes-Consani-Marcolli 05](#ConnesConsaniMarcolli05)). ([Meyer 06](#Meyer06)). 

Specifically the characterization in terms of spans/correspondences [above](#InTermsOfCorrespondences) is reminiscent to the definition of [[pure motives]], see the rferences below: _[In terms of correspondences](#ReferencesInTermsOfCorrespondences). A relation between bivariant [[algebraic K-theory]] and [[motivic cohomology]] is discussed in ([Garkusha-Panin 11](#GarkushaPanin11)).

A universal [[functor]] from KK-theory to [[noncommutative motives]]

$$
  KK \longrightarrow NCC_{dg}
$$

was given in ([Mahanta 13](#Mahanta13)). This sends a [[C*-algebra]] to the [[dg-category]] of [[perfect complexes]] over (the [[unitalization]] of) its underlying [[associative algebra]].

### Equivariant KK-theory
 {#EquivariantKKTheory}

Pretty much all of KK-theory has a generalization to [[equivariant cohomology]] where all algebras and modules are equipped with [[actions]] of a given [[topological group]] or more generally [[topological groupoid]] $\mathcal{G}$, and all operators are suitably [[invariant|invariant]]/[[equivariance|equivariant]] under this action. See at _[[equivariant KK-theory]]_ for more.

The [[Baum-Connes conjecture]] and the [[Green-Julg theorem]] assert that under some conditions $\mathcal{G}$-equivariant KK-theory is equivalent to the plain KK-theory of the [[groupoid convolution algebras]] of the corresponding [[action groupoids]]. See at _[[Green-Julg theorem]]_ for details.

For $f \colon A \to B$ a [[homomorphism]] of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ [[graded C*-algebras]], take $B$ as a right [[Hilbert module]] over itself and equip it with the left [[action]] of $A$ induced by $f$. This makes it a [[Hilbert bimodule]]. Together with the 0-[[Fredholm operator]], this represents an element

### The archetypical examples

+-- {: .num_example }
###### Example

Let $(X,g)$ be a [[closed manifold|closed]] [[smooth manifold|smooth]] [[Riemannian manifold]], and let $V_0, V_1$ be two smooth [[vector bundles]] over $X$ with Hermitian strucure ([[associated bundle|associated]] to a chosen [[unitary group]]-[[principal bundle]]). 

Then given an [[elliptic operator|elliptic]] [[pseudodifferential operator]]

$$
  P \colon \Gamma(V_0) \to \Gamma(V_1)

on smooth [[sections]] it extends to an essentially [[unitary operator|unitary]] [[Fredholm operator]] on [[square integrable function|square integrable]] sections $L^2(V_i)$. 

Consider then the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded [[Hilbert space]]

$$
  H \coloneqq L^2(V_0) \oplus L^2(V_1)

is a [[Fredholm operator]] on $H$, so that

$$

and 

$$
  F \coloneqq \frac{D}{\sqrt{1 + D^2}}

## Properties


### Relation to operator K-cohomology, K-homology, twisted K-theory
 {#RelationToKCohomologyAndTwistedKTheory}

KK-theory is a joint generalization of [[operator K-theory]], hence also of [[topological K-theory]], as well as of [[K-homology]] and of [[twisted K-theory]].

For $A \in $ [[C*Alg]] we have that 

* $KK(\mathbb{C}, A) \simeq K_0(A)$ 

is the [[operator K-theory]] group of $A$ in degree 0 and

* $KK(C(\mathbb{R}^1),A) \simeq K_1(A)$

is the [[operator K-theory]] group of $A$ in degree 1. (e.g. ([Introduction, p. 20](#Introduction)). If here $A = C(X)$ is the [[C*-algebra]] of functions on a suitable [[topological space]] $X$, then this is the [[topological K-theory]] of that space

* $KK(\mathbb{C}, C(X)) \simeq K^0(X)$

* $KK(C(\mathbb{R}), C(X)) \simeq K^1(X)$.

More generally, if $A = C_r(\mathcal{G}_\bullet)$ is the reduced [[groupoid convolution algebra]] of a [[Lie groupoid]], then 

* $KK(\mathbb{C}, C_r(\mathcal{G}_\bullet)) \simeq K^0(\mathcal{G})$

is the K-theory of the corresponding [[differentiable stack]]. If moreover $c \colon \mathcal{G} \to \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)$ is a [[circle 2-group]]-[[principal 2-bundle]] ($U(1)$-[[bundle gerbe]]) over $\mathcal{X}$ and if $A = C(\mathcal{X}_\bullet, c)$ is the  [[twisted groupoid convolution algebra]] of the corresponding [[centrally extended Lie groupoid]], then 

* $KK(\mathbb{C}, C_r(\mathcal{X}_\bullet,x)) = K^0(\mathcal{X}, c)$ 

is the corresponding [[twisted K-theory]] ([Tu, Xu, Laurent-Gengoux 03](#TXLG)).


On the other hand, with $A$ in the first argument and the complex numbers in the second we have that

* $K(A,\mathbb{C}) \simeq K^0(A)$

ar equivalence classes of $A$-[[Fredholm modules]] and hence the [[K-homology]] of $A$.

(...)


### Relation to extensions

There is an [[isomorphism]]

$KK(A,B) \simeq Ext^1(A,B)$

to a suitable group of suitable [[extensions]] of $A$ by $B$. ([Kasparov 80](#Kasparov80), reviewed in [Inassaridze](#Inassaridze)).

###### Proposition

There is a [[functor]]

$$
  \mathbb{K}(-) \;\colon\; C^\ast Alg \to Ho(Spectra)
$$

to the [[stable homotopy category]] such that 

1. $\pi_n(\mathbb{K})(A) \simeq K_n(A)$, for all $A \in C^\ast Alg$, (hence the spectrum is a cohomology spectrum for the [[operator K-theory]] of $A$);

1. $\mathbb{K}(\mathbb{C})$ is naturally a [[ring spectrum]];

1. $\mathbb{K}(A)$ is naturally a [[symmetric spectrum|symmetric]] $\mathbb{K}(\mathbb{C})$-[[module spectrum]]

1. $\mathbb{K}$ lifts to a [[lax monoidal functor]]
  
   $$
     \mathbb{K} \;\colon\; C^\ast Alg \to Ho(\mathbb{K}(\mathbb{C}) Mod)
   $$

   to the [[homotopy category]] of [[module spectra]], and this in turn extends to a [[lax monoidal functor]] on the KK-category

   $$
     \mathbb{K} \;\colon\; KK \to Ho(\mathbb{K}(\mathbb{C}) Mod)
     \,.
   $$

1. $\mathbb{K}$ restricts to a [[fully faithful functor]] on the [[thick subcategory]] of the [[triangulated category]] $KK$ generated by the [[tensor unit]] (the "[[bootstrap category]]").

=--

This is the main result of ([DEKM 11, section 3](#DEKM11)).

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

Since $\mathbb{K}$ is a [[lax monoidal functor]] in particular it preserves [[dual objects]] and [[dual morphisms]], hence [[PoincarÃ© duality algebras]] and their [[Umkehr maps]]. 

=--



### KÃ¼nneth theorem

The [[thick subcategory]] of the [[triangulated category]] $KK$ generated from the [[tensor unit]] is called the _[[bootstrap category]]_ $Boot \hookrightarrow KK$. For $A \in Boot \hookrightarrow KK$ one has that $KK(A,B)$ satisfies a [[KÃ¼nneth theorem]]. See at _[[bootstrap category]]_ for more.

### Push-forward in KK-theory
 {#UmkehrMap}

[[Umkehr map]] in KK-theory ([Brodzki-Mathai-Rosenberg-Szabo 07, section 3.3](#BrodzkiMathaiRosenbergSzabo07))

If $A$, $B$ are [[PoincarÃ© duality algebras]], 
def. \ref{PoincareDualityAlgebra}, then for $f \colon A \to B$ a morphism, the corresponding [[Umkehr map]] is (postcomposition) with the [[dual morphism]] of its [[opposite algebra]] version:

$$
  f! \coloneqq (f^op)^\ast
  \,.
$$

([Brodzki-Mathai-Rosenberg-Szabo 07, p. 14](#BrodzkiMathaiRosenbergSzabo07))

### In Category theory and Homotopy theory

KK-theory is naturally understood in terms of [[universal properties]] in [[category theory]] and in [[homotopy theory]].

That $KK(A,B)$ is naturally thought of as a collection of "generalized [[homomorphisms]]" of $C^\ast$-algebras was amplified in 

* [[Joachim Cuntz]], _Generalized Homomorphisms Between $C^\ast$-algebras and KK-theory_, Springer Lecture Notes in Mathematics, 1031 (1983), 31-45.

* [[Joachim Cuntz]], _K-theory and C*-algebras_, Springer Lecture Notes in Mathematics, 1046 (1984), 55-79.

That under the Kasparov product these are indeed the [[hom-objects]] in a [[category]] was first observed in 

* [[Nigel Higson]], _A characterization of KK-theory_,  Pacific J. Math. Volume 126, Number 2 (1987), 253-276. ([EUCLID](http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.pjm/1102699804))

where moreover this category is realized as the [[universal property|universal]] additive and split exact "[[localization]]" of $C^\ast Alg$ at the $C^\ast$-algebra of [[compact operators]].



The generalization of this statement to [[equivariant cohomology|equivariant]] KK-theory is in 

* Klaus Thomsen, _The universal property of equivariant KK-theory_ ([K-theory preprint](http://www.math.uiuc.edu/K-theory/0249/))
 {#Thomsen98}

Characterization of KK-theory as the [[satellites]] of a functor is in 

* [[Hvedri Inassaridze]], _Universal property of Kasparov bivariant K-theory_ ([[InassaridzeOnKK.pdf:file]], [ps](http://www.math.uni-bielefeld.de/~bak/kasp.ps))
 {#Inassaridze}

A [[triangulated category]] structure for KK-theory is discussed in

A [[model category]] realization of KK-theory is discussed in 

* [[Michael Joachim]], [[Mark Johnson]], _Realizing Kasparov's KK-theory groups as the homotopy classes of maps of a Quillen model category_ ([arXiv:0705.1971](http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.1971))

A [[category of fibrant objects]]-structure on [[C*Alg]] which unifies the above homotopical pictures is discussed in

Further discussion in the context of [[stable homotopy theory]] and [[E-theory]] is in

Refinement of [[operator K-theory]] to cohomology [[spectra]] is discussed in 

* [[Ulrich Bunke]], [[Michael Joachim]], [[Stephan Stolz]], _Classifying spaces and spectra representing the K-theory of a graded $C^\ast$-algebra_, High-dimensional manifold topology, World Sci. Publ., River Edge, NJ, 2003, pp. 80â€“102
 {#BunkeJoachimStolz03}
 
This construction is functorial (only) for _essential_ $\ast$-homomorphisms of [[C*-algebras]].

A refinement of the KK-category to a [[spectrum]]-[[enriched category]] ($\sim$ [[stable (âˆž,1)-category]]) is claimed in 

* [[Michael Joachim]], [[Stephan Stolz]], _An enrichment of $KK$-theory over the category of symmetric spectra_ MÃ¼nster J. of Math. 2 (2009), 143â€“182 ([pdf](http://www3.nd.edu/~stolz/KKenrich.pdf))
 {#JoachimStolz09}

and the generalization of this to [[equivariant K-theory]] over geometrically discrete groupoids is discussed in 

* [[Paul Mitchener]], _$KK$-theory spectra for $C^\ast$-categories and discrete groupoid $C^\ast$-algebras_ ([arXiv:0711.2152](http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.2152))
 {#Mitchener07}

but this construction is stated to be mistaken on p. 3 of 

* [[Ivo Dell'Ambrogio]], [[Heath Emerson]], [[Tamaz Kandelaki]], [[Ralf Meyer]], _A functorial equivariant K-theory spectrum and an equivariant Lefschetz formula_ ([arXiv:1104.3441](http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.3441))
 {#DEKM11}

This article in turn considers a variant of the construction in ([Bunke-Joachim-Stolz 03](#BunkeJoachimStolz03)) which gives operator K-theory spectra that are functorial for general $\ast$-homomorphisms.

### In terms of correspondences/spans
 {#ReferencesInTermsOfCorrespondences}

#### For plain KK-theory

KK-classes between [[algebras of functions]] on [[smooth manifolds]] are described in terms of [[equivalence classes]] of [[correspondence]] manifolds carrying a [[vector bundle]] in section 3 of

* [[Alain Connes]], [[Georges Skandalis]], _The longitudinal index theorem for foliations_. Publ. Res. Inst. Math. Sci. 20,
no. 6, 1139â€“1183 (1984) ([pdf](http://www.alainconnes.org/docs/longitudinal.pdf))
 {#ConnesSkandalis84}

This generalizes the [[Baum-Douglas geometric cycles]] from [[K-homology]] to KK-theory.

A further generalization of this, where one algebra $C(Y)$ is generalized to $C(Y) \otimes A$ for $A$ a unital separable $C^\ast$-algebra, is in section 3 of

* [[Jonathan Block]], [[Shmuel Weinberger]], _Arithmetic manifolds of positive scalar curvature._, J. Diff. Geom. 52, no. 2, 375â€“406 (1999). ([web](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.30.297))

 {#BrodzkiMathaiRosenbergSzabo07}

this is reviewed and then a characterization in terms of [[co-spans]] of [[C*-algebras]] is given. This version is effectively a restatement of [the characterization by Cuntz](#RelationToHomotopyClassesOfStarHomomorphisms) as reproduced in ([Blackadar 99, corollary 17.8.4](#Blackadar99)).

#### For equivariant KK-theory
 {#ReferencesCorrespondencesEquivariant}

 {#Mahanta13}

it is shown that there is a universal functor $KK \longrightarrow NCC_{dg}$ from [[KK-theory]] to the category of [[noncommutative motives]], which is the category of [[dg-categories]] and dg-[[profunctors]] up to homotopy between them. This is given by sending a [[C*-algebra]] to the [[dg-category]] of [[perfect complexes]] of (the unitalization of) its underlying [[associative algebra]].
