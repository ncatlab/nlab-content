##Idea

### General

A _spacetime_ is a [[manifold]] that models [[space]] and [[time]] in [[physics]].

This is formalized by saying that a **spacetime** is a [[smooth Lorentzian space]] $(X,\mu)$ equipped with a time orientation (see there).

In the context of classical [[general relativity]] a **spacetime** is usually in addition assumed to be connected and four-dimensional.

In [[classical physics]], notably in [[special relativity]] and [[general relativity]] points in $X$ model coordinates where _events_ can take place from the viewpoint of an observer ("points in space and time") while the metric $\mu$ models the field of [[gravity]] in [[general relativity]].


### Intermingling of space and time
The noun "spacetime" is used in both [[special relativity]] and [[general relativity]], but is best motivated from the viewpoint of [[general relativity]]. [[special relativity|Special relativity]] deals with the [[Minkowski spacetime]] only. The [[Minkowski spacetime]] allows a _canonical_ choice of _global_ coordinates such that the metric tensor has in every point the form diag(-1, 1, 1, 1), which identifies the first coordinate as representing the time coordinate and the others as representing space coordinates.

Given a general spacetime, there is not necessarily a globally defined coordinate system, and therefore not necessarily a globally defined _canonical_ time coordinate. More specifically, there are spacetimes that admit coordinates defined on subsets where the _physical_ interpretation of the coordinates as modelling time and space coordinates _changes_ over the domain of definition.

(TODO: references and explanations).
