###### Proposition

In [[classical mathematics]], every locally compact locale is [[spatial locale|spatial]], hence may be regarded as a [[locally compact topological space]].

###### Remark

Prop. \ref{UsingClassicalLogicLocallyCompactLocaleIsSpatial} may fail in [[constructive mathematics]]. For instance any [[spectrum of a commutative ring]], considered as a locale, is locally compact, but may fail to be spatial (because of the lack of [[ideal|filters]]).

###### Propsition

Locally compact locales are also exactly the [[exponentiable objects]] in the [[category of locales]].
