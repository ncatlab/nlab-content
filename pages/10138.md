A [[locale]] is **locally compact** if its [[frame]] of opens is a [[continuous poset]].

In [[classical mathematics]], every locally compact locale is spatial, hence a [[locally compact space]].

Locally compact locales are also exactly the [[exponentiable objects]] in the category of locales.
