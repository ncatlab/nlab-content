## Idea

### General

For $\mu_S$ a [[Gaussian probability measure]] and $\exp(-I)\mu_S$ a perturbation with $I$ [[polynomial ring|polynomial]] at least of degree 3, there is a combinatorial expression for the [[moments]]/[[expectation values]] of $\exp(-I)\mu_S$ as a sum over certain [[graphs]] whose $k$-ary vertices are labeled by the monomials of degree $k$ in $I$. (This is such that for $I = 0$ it reduces to [[Wick's lemma]].)

These graphs are called _Feynman diagrams_.

### In quantum field theory

Feynman graphs play a central role in [[perturbation theory]] in [[quantum field theory]] where $\exp(I)\mu_S$ plays the role of an [[action functional]] on a space of [[field (physics)|fields]], $\mu_S$ is the exponentiazed [[kinetic action]] and hence the [[measure]] for [[free fields]], while $\exp(I)$ is the [[interaction]] part of the [[action functional]]: the order-$k$ monomials in $I$ encode an interaction of $k$ [[field (physics)|fields]]. In this context the corresponding Feynman diagrams are traditionally thought of as depicting interaction processes of quanta of these fields, with propagation along the edges and interaction at the vertices. But this interpretation has its limits, which is partly reflected in speaking of "[[virtual particles]]".

## Details

### For finitely many degrees of freedoms
 {#ForFinitelyManyDegreesOfFreedom}

We discuss Feynman diagrams for a single real [[scalar field]] on a discrete space of $k\in \mathbb{N}$ points. This contains in it already all the aspects Feynman diagrams and in this context everything is easily well-defined. The generalization to more field components is immediate and simply obtained by thinking of all "$\phi$" in the following as taking values in some appropriate [[representation]] space and all products of $\phi$s as given by suitable [[intertwiners]] and [[inner products]], otherwise the form of the formulas remains the same. The generalization continuous space (non-finitely many degrees of freedom) all the diagrammatics remains the same, the only issue now is to make sense (namely via [[renormalization]]) of the numerical value that is assigned to any one Feynman diagram.

So a [[field (physics)|field]] $\phi$ here is a map $[k]\to \mathbb{R}$ from the $k$-element [[finite set]] to the [[real numbers]], and hence the space of all field configurations is $\mathbb{R}^k$.

Fix then a $k \times k$ real-valued [[matrix]] $A \coloneqq (A_{x y}) \in Mat_{k\times k}(\mathbb{R})$ of non-vanishing [[determinant]] $det A \neq 0$. 

For standard applications this $A$ is a discretized version of the [[Laplacian]] and then the expression 

$$
  S_{kin} = E_{kin} \coloneqq 
  \tfrac{1}{2}\sum_{x,y = 1}^k \phi_x A_{x y} \phi_y
$$ 

is the [[kinetic energy]] and [[kinetic action]] of the field configuration $\phi$. More concretely, think of the set of $k$ space points as being a discretization of a circle and write $(\phi_p)$ for the corresponding ([[discrete Fourier transform|discrete]]) [[Fourier transform]] of $(\phi_x)$. Then the kinetic term of the [[free field theory|free]] [[scalar field]] on this space is given by $A$ which is the [[diagonal matrix]] in the $p$-basis with 

$$
  A_{p,p} = p^2 - m^2
  \,,
$$ 

where $m$ is a constant called the [[mass]] of the [[field (physics)|field]] $\phi$.


A [[sum]] over all values of $\phi$ is the finite (and hence well-defined) analog of a [[path integral]]. The [[Gaussian integral]] of $A$ is called the _[[partition function]]_:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
  Z_0
  & \coloneqq 
  \int  \exp(- S_{kin}(\phi)) \,D\phi
  \\
  & \coloneqq
  \int_{\mathbb{R}^k}
  \,
  \exp(- \tfrac{1}{2}\sum_{x,y = 1}^k \phi_{x} A_{x,y} \phi_y  )
  \;
  d\phi_{1} \cdots d\phi_{k} 
  \\
  & =
  (2\pi)^{k/2} (det A)^{-1/2}
  \end{aligned}
$$


An _[[n-point function]]_ $\langle \phi_{x_1} \phi_{x_2} \cdots \phi_{x_n}\rangle$ is an  $n$th [[moment]] of this Gaussian distribution:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
  \langle \phi_{x_1} \phi_{x_2} \cdots \phi_{x_n}\rangle
  & \coloneqq
  \frac{1}{Z_0}
  \int  
    \left( 
    \exp(-S_{kin}(\phi))
    \phi_{x_1}\phi_{x_2}\cdots \phi_{x_n}
    \right)
    D \phi
  \\
  & \coloneqq
  \frac{1}{Z_0} 
  \int_{\mathbb{R}^k} 
  \left(
  \exp(-\tfrac{1}{2} \phi_x A_{x,y}\phi_y)
  \,
  \phi_{x_1}\phi_{x_2} \cdots\phi_{x_n}
  \right)
  d\phi_1 \cdots d\phi_k
  \end{aligned}
$$

In order to compute these conveniently, pass to the [[generating function]] obtained by adding a [[source]] [[variable]] $J = (J_x)$:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
  Z(J)
  & \coloneqq
  \int( \exp(- S_{kin}(\phi) + J \cdot\phi) ) D\phi
  \\
  & \coloneqq
  \int_{\mathbb{R}^k}  
    \exp(- \tfrac{1}{2}\sum_{x = 1}^k \phi_{x} A_{x,y} \phi_y 
    + \sum_{x = 1}^k J_x \phi_x
   )
  \;
  d\phi_{1} \cdots d\phi_{k}
  \\
    & =
    Z_0 \exp(\tfrac{1}{2} \sum_{x = 1}^k J_x A^{-1}_{x,y} J_y)
  \end{aligned}
  \,,
$$

where $A^{-1} = (A^{-1}_{x,y})$ is the [[inverse matrix]] of $A$, which appears by computing the new integral here again as a [[Gaussian integral]] after [[completing the square]] in the exponent. 

In applications to field theory this $A^{-1}$ is called the _[[Feynman propagator]]_. In the standard example where $A$ is the kinetic term of the [[free field theory|free field]] of [[mass]] $m$ then in Fourier-transformed components $A^{-1}$ is diagonal with components

$$
  A^{-1}_{p,p} = \frac{1}{p^2 - m^2}
  \,.
$$

Notice that using "[[Schwinger parameterization]]" the [[propagator]] is equivalently rewritten as a [[Mellin transform]] [[integral]]:

$$
  A^{-1}_{x,y} = \int_0^\infty \exp(- \tau A_{x,y}) d\tau
  \,.
$$ 

Again in the example of the standard [[scalar field]] kinetic term expressed in Fourier diagonalization $A_{p,p}= p^2 - m^2$ then with $X \colon [0,\tau] \to \mathbb{R}$ a parameterization of the straight line with slope $p$, the exponent is equivalently

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \tau A_{p,p}
    & = 
    \tau (p^2 - m^2)
    \\
    & = 
    \int_0^\tau (\dot X^2 - m^2)
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

This happens to be the standard [[action functional]] ([[Polyakov action]]) for a [[sigma model]] describing the propagation of a particle along its [[worldline]].
This means that the propagator of the [[scalar field]] may be thought of as coming from the [[path integral]] of a scalar particle along its [[worldline]]. This perspective is called the "[[worldline formalism]]", it is a formalization of [[second quantization]], expressing the dynamics of [[field (physics)|fields]] in terms of that of their particle "quanta" running along [[worldlines]] of the form of the corresponding Feynman diagrams (to which we finally come in a moment).

Back to the computation of the $n$-point function. By construction, it is now equally expressed by [[partial derivatives]] of the [[generating function]] with respect to the [[source]] [[variable]] $J$ and evaluated at $J = 0$, and this in turn is a combinatorial expression just in products of the [[propagator]]:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \langle \phi_{x_1} \cdots \phi_{x_n}  \rangle
    &=
    \frac{1}{Z_0}
    \left(
    \frac{\partial}{\partial J_{x_1}}
    \cdots
    \frac{\partial}{\partial J_{x_n}}
    Z(J)
    \right)_{\vert J = 0}
    \\
    & =
   \left(
   \frac{\partial}{\partial J_{x_1}}
   \cdots
   \frac{\partial}{\partial J_{x_n}}
   \exp(\tfrac{1}{2} \sum_{x = 1}^k J_{x} A^{-1}_{x y} J_y)
   \right)_{\vert J = 0}
   \\
   & = 
   \underset{pairings}{\sum}  A^{-1}_{x_{j_1} x_{j_2}} \cdot A^{-1}_{x_{j_3} x_{j_4}} \cdots A^{-1}_{x_{j_{n-1}}x_{j_n}}
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

Here the last [[equality]] -- known as [[Wick's theorem]] -- comes from simple inspection: take the derivatives inside the [[exponential series]] and observe that then the only summands non-vanishing at $J = 0$ appears for even $n$ and are those where all derivatives hit the monomial $\left(\tfrac{1}{2} \sum_{x = 1}^k J_{x} A^{-1}_{x y} J_y\right)^{n/2}$.

Thinking of $A^{-1}_{x y}$ here as labeling an [[edge]] (a "[[worldline]]") from [[vertex]] $x$ to vertex $y$ This is the source of all Feynman digrammatics.

Now consider a [[polynomial]] $V(\phi)$ of degree $\geq 3$.  In applications to field theory this represents the [[potential energy]] or (self)[[interaction]] of the field configuration. The difference of the [[kinetic energy]] and the [[potential energy]] is called the (here: "Wick rotated"/"Euclidean") [[action]]

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    S & =  S_{kin} + S_{int} 
    \\
    & = \tfrac{1}{2} \sum_{x,y = 1}^k \phi_x A_{x y} \phi_y - g V(\phi)
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

The prefactor $g$ is called the _[[coupling constant]]_.


Putting everything together, the integral over the full [[action]] may be expressed as a [[power series]] in the [[coupling constant]] $g$ of the [[moments]] with respect to the kinetic action of the powers of the interaction term:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
  Z(g)
  & = 
  \int \exp(- S(\phi)) \, D\phi
  \\
  & \coloneqq
  \frac{1}{Z}
  \int \left(\exp(-\tfrac{1}{2} \sum_{x,y = 1}^k \phi_x A_{x y} \phi_y + g V(\phi)) \right)
  \, d\phi_1 \cdots d\phi_k
  \\
  & =  
  \langle \exp(g V(\phi))  \rangle
  \\
  & = 
  1 + g \langle V(\phi)\rangle + \frac{g^2}{2} \langle V(\phi) ^2\rangle + \cdots
  \end{aligned}
$$

By [[Wick's theorem]] stated above, each $\langle V(\phi)^\ell\rangle$ is equivalently expressed as a sum over products of components of the [[propagator]] $A^{-1}_{x y}$. Thinking of each such propagator term as an [[edge]] produces a diagram, this is the corresponding Feynman diagram.

For instance, for a cubic point interaction

$$
  V(\phi) = \sum_x \phi_x^3
$$

then 

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \langle V(\phi)^2 \rangle
    &\coloneqq
    \langle (\sum_{x= 1}^k)(\phi_x)^3 \rangle
    \\
    & = \sum_{x_1, x_2 = 1}^k
    \langle \phi_{x_1}\phi_{x_1} \phi_{x_1}\phi_{x_2}\phi_{x_2}\phi_{x_2}\rangle
    \\ 
    & =
    prefactor
    \;
    \sum_{x_1,x_2 = 1}^k 
    \underset{dumbbell\, diagram}{\underbrace{A^{-1}_{x_1 x_1} A^{-1}_{x_1 x_2} A^{-1}_{x_2 x_2}}}
    +
    prefactor
    \;
    \sum_{x_1, x_2 = 1}^k 
    \underset{theta\, diagram}{\underbrace{A^{-1}_{x_1 x_2} A^{-1}_{x_1 x_2} A^{-1}_{x_1 x_2}}}
  \end{aligned}
$$

Here the first summand corresponds to the "dumbbell" Feynman diagram of the form

and the second summand corresponds to the "theta" Feynman diagram of the form

### As string diagrams (morphisms in monoidal categories)
 {#AsStringDiagrams}

It has been observed that Feynman diagrams, notably in [[gauge theory]],
are in particular [[string diagrams]] (in the sense of [[category theory]],
not here in any sense of [[string theory]]!) in the given 
[[category of representations]]: the edges are labelled by
[[particle]] [[species]], hence by [[Wigner classification]]
by [[irreps]], and the vertices are labeled by representation
[[homomorphisms]] ("[[intertwiners]]") which, indeed, label the
[[interaction]] of particles in the Feynman diagram.

A review of this formulation is in 

* [[John Baez]], [[Aaron Lauda]], _A Prehistory of n-Categorical Physics_, Deep beauty, 13-128, Cambridge Univ. Press, Cambridge, 2011 ([arXiv:0908.2469](http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.2469))

Moreover, one may think of [[string diagrams]] in [[monoidal categories]] as providing [[categorical semantics]] for [[proof nets]] (see there for more) in multiplicative [[linear logic]]. Under this
identification then Feynman diagrams have a relation to [[proof nets]]. Something like this is discussed in
