## Idea

### General

For $\mu_S$ a [[Gaussian probability measure]] and $\exp(-I)\mu_S$ a perturbation with $I$ [[polynomial ring|polynomial]] at least of degree 3, there is a combinatorial expression for the [[moments]]/[[expectation values]] of $\exp(-I)\mu_S$ as a sum over certain [[graphs]] whose $k$-ary vertices are labeled by the monomials of degree $k$ in $I$. (This is such that for $I = 0$ it reduces to [[Wick's lemma]].)

These graphs are called _Feynman diagrams_.

### In quantum field theory

Feynman graphs play a central role in [[perturbation theory]] in [[quantum field theory]] where $\exp(I)\mu_S$ plays the role of an [[action functional]] on a space of [[field (physics)|fields]], $\mu_S$ is the kinetic action and measure for [[free fields]]  and $\exp(I)$ is the interaction part of th action functional: the order-$k$ monomials in $I$ encode an interaction of $k$ [[field (physics)|fields]]. In this context the corresponding Feynman diagrams are traditionally thought of as depicting interaction processes of quanta of these fields, with propagation along the edges and interaction at the vertices. But this interpretation has its limits, which is partly reflected in speaking of "[[virtual particles]]".

### As string diagrams (morphisms in monoidal categories)
 {#AsStringDiagrams}

It has been observed that Feynman diagrams, notably in [[gauge theory]],
are in particular [[string diagrams]] (in the sense of [[category theory]],
not here in any sense of [[string theory]]!) in the given 
[[category of representations]]: the edges are labelled by
[[particle]] [[species]], hence by [[Wigner classification]]
by [[irreps]], and the vertices are labeled by representation
[[homomorphisms]] ("[[intertwiners]]") which, indeed, label the
[[interaction]] of particles in the Feynman diagram.

A review of this formulation is in 

* [[John Baez]], [[Aaron Lauda]], _A Prehistory of n-Categorical Physics_, Deep beauty, 13-128, Cambridge Univ. Press, Cambridge, 2011 ([arXiv:0908.2469](http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.2469))

Moreover, one may think of [[string diagrams]] in [[monoidal categories]] as providing [[categorical semantics]] for [[proof nets]] (see there for more) in multiplicative [[linear logic]]. Under this
identification then Feynman diagrams have a relation to [[proof nets]]. Something like this is discussed in
