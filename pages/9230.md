## Idea

### General

For $\mu_S$ a [[Gaussian probability measure]] and $\exp(-I)\mu_S$ a perturbation with $I$ [[polynomial ring|polynomial]] at least of degree 3, there is a combinatorial expression for the [[moments]]/[[expectation values]] of $\exp(-I)\mu_S$ as a sum over certain [[graphs]] whose $k$-ary vertices are labeled by the monomials of degree $k$ in $I$. (This is such that for $I = 0$ it reduces to [[Wick's lemma]].)

These graphs are called _Feynman diagrams_.

### In quantum field theory

Feynman graphs play a central role in [[perturbation theory]] in [[quantum field theory]] where $\exp(I)\mu_S$ plays the role of an [[action functional]] on a space of [[field (physics)|fields]], $\mu_S$ is the kinetic action and measure for [[free fields]]  and $\exp(I)$ is the interaction part of th action functional: the order-$k$ monomials in $I$ encode an interaction of $k$ [[field (physics)|fields]]. In this context the corresponding Feynman diagrams are traditionally thought of as depicting interaction processes of quanta of these fields, with propagation along the edges and interaction at the vertices. But this interpretation has its limits, which is partly reflected in speaking of "[[virtual particles]]".
