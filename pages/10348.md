On the effect of awarding prizes to otherwise respectable scientists:

> By the late 1970s I began to think of myself as a Nobel contender. But I was under the impression that my old friend [[Steven Weinberg]] was doing everything in his power to keep the prize for himself and [[Abdus Salam|Salam]]. In particular -- at a conference that he attended in Tokyo -- he went out of his way to avoid mentioning my name at all while presenting the history of weak interaction theory. I got very upset by that omission. It was the issue which terminated our friendship. In the summer of 1979, I was invited to a meeting in Stockholm, to discuss the current state of physics ideas and others. Prior to the meeting, I sent a transcript of my talk to Steve. He was violently against my giving the talk. Because it examined various alternatives to what was then known as Weinberg/Salam theory. In fact, it was an open-minded talk in which I was discussing whether their -- or more properly -- our theory was a correct one or not. But it was such a heated discussion that I eventually had to simply hang up on him, because I had no intention of revising my talk. And I did not.
