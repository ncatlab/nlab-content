## Idea

A **$k$-truncated object** in an [[n-category]] is an object which "behaves internally like a $k$-category".  More precisely, since an object of an $n$-category can behave at most like an $(n-1)$-category, a $k$-truncated object behaves like a $max(k,n-1)$-category.  More generally, a **$(k,m)$-truncated object** in an [[(n,r)-category]] is an object which behaves internally like a $max((k,m),(n-1,r-1))$-category.

## Definition

Let $C$ be an $(n,r)$-category, where $n$ and $r$ can range from $-2$ to $\infty$ inclusive.  An object $x\in C$ is **$(k,m)$-truncated** if for all objects $a\in C$, the $(n-1,r-1)$-category $C(a,x)$ is in fact a $(k,m)$-category.

## Examples

* In a [[1-category]]:
  * every object is 0-truncated, 
  * the (-1)-truncated objects are the [[subterminal objects]], and
  * the (-2)-truncated objects are the [[terminal objects]].

* In a [[2-category]]:
  * every object is 1-truncated,
  * the 0-truncated objects are the [[discrete object in a 2-category|discrete objects]],
  * the (1,0)-truncated objects are the [[groupoidal objects]], and
  * the (0,1)-truncated objects are the [[posetal objects]].

* In an $(\infty,1)$-category, the $k$-truncated objects (which are automatically $(k,0)$-truncated) are also called **$k$-types**.  See [[n-truncated object of an (∞,1)-category]].

## Properties

### Reflectivity

If the $(n,r)$-category has sufficient exactness properties, then the $(k,m)$-truncated objects are a [[reflective subcategory]].  More generally, in such a case there is a [[orthogonal factorization system|factorization system]] $(E,M)$ such that $M/1$ is the category of $(k,m)$-truncated objects.  (Note that this is *not* a [[reflective factorization system]], but it is often a [[stable factorization system]].)  For example:

* In any category with a terminal object, the subcategory of terminal objects is reflective, and corresponds to the factorization system $E = $ all morphisms, $M=$ isomorphisms.

* In a [[regular category]], the category of subterminal objects is reflective, and corresponds to the factorization system $E=$ regular epimorphisms, $M=$ monomorphisms.

* In a [[regular 2-category]], the same holds true, where $E$ is the class of regular 1-epimorphisms ([[eso morphisms]]) and $M$ the class of 1-monomorphisms ([[ff morphisms]]).  With additional exactness conditions, the categories of 0-truncated, (1,0)-truncated, and (0,1)-truncated objects are also reflective; see [[michaelshulman:truncation in an exact 2-category|here]].

* In an [[(∞,1)-topos]], the $n$-truncated objects are reflective and we have the [[(n-connected, n-truncated) factorization system]].
