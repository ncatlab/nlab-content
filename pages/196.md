## Idea

A **function** is a [[homomorphism]] of [[set]]s. Functions are the [[morphism]]s in the [[category]] [[Set]].

A function is sometimes called a __total function__ to distinguish it from a [[partial function]].

See [[set theory]] for more details.


## As morphisms of discrete categories

If we regard sets as [[discrete categories]], then a **function** is a [[functor]] between [[sets]]. The functoriality structure becomes the property that a function preserves [[equality]]:

\[ x = y \Rightarrow f(x) = f(y) .\]
