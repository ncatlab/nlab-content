## Idea

In a strict sense of the term, a **function** is a [[homomorphism]] $f : S \to T$ of [[sets]].  

A function from a [[set]] $A$ to a set $B$ is determined by giving, for each element of $A$, a specified element of $B$.  The process of passing from elements of $A$ to elements of $B$ is called [[function application]].  The set $A$ is called the [[domain]] of $f$, and $B$ is called its [[codomain]].

A function is sometimes called a __total function__ to distinguish it from a [[partial function]].


More generally, every [[morphism]] between [[objects]] in a [[category]] may be thought of as a function in a generalized sense. This generalized use of the word is wide spread (and justified) in [[type theory]], where for $S$ and $T$ two [[types]], there is a [[function type]] denoted $S \to T$ and then the expression $f : S \to T$ means that $f$ is a [[term]] of [[function type]], hence is a function. 

In this generalized sense, functions between sets are the [[morphisms]] in the [[category]] [[Set]].  This is [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]], and the [[function type]] $S \to T$ is then the [[function set]].

For more on this more general use of "function" see at _[[function type]]_.





## Foundations

The formal definition of a function depends on the [[foundations]] chosen.

* In [[material set theory]], a function $f$ is often defined to be a set of [[ordered pairs]] such that for every $x$, there is at most one $y$ such that $(x,y)\in f$.  The [[domain]] of $f$ is then the set of all $x$ for which there exists some such $y$.  This definition is not entirely satisfactory since it does not determine the codomain (since not every element of the codomain may be in the [[image]]); thus to be completely precise it is better to define a function to be an ordered triple $(f,A,B)$ where $A$ is the domain and $B$ the codomain.

* In [[structural set theory]], the role of functions depends on the particular axiomatization chosen.  In [[ETCS]], functions are among the undefined things, whereas in [[SEAR]], functions are defined to be particular relations (which in turn are undefined things).

* In [[type theory]], functions are simply [[terms]] belonging to [[function types]].

See [[set theory]] and [[type theory]] for more details.


## As morphisms of discrete categories

If we regard sets as [[discrete categories]], then a **function** is a [[functor]] between [[sets]]. The functoriality structure becomes the property that a function preserves [[equality]]:

\[ x = y \Rightarrow f(x) = f(y) .\]
