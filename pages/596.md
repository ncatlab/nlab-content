#Idea#

* A _multi(co)span_ is supposed to be something that generalizes [[span]] (and [[cospan]]) both horizontally and vertically: it may have a number of legs different from 2, but more importantly it need not be a single roof but can be a more complex diagram.

* A multispan is supposed to be a model for a _hierarchical cell complex_ with
  
  * a single top "cell" $K(\top) \in C$ (an object in some ambient category $C$);

  * for each cell $K(a)$ a collection of morphisms $\{K(b_i) \to K(a)\}_i$ into it, to be thought of as pieces of boundary components of $K(a)$;

    * in the language of [[hyperstructure]]s we would say that $K(a)$ is a _bond_ for the $K(b_i)$

  * and so on;

  * such that the entire resulting diagram commutes, expressing the fact how one boundary pieces may be part of different higher order boundary pieces.

Multi-cospans of [[cube|cubical]] shape have been introduced and studied by Marco Grandis in his work on [[Cospans in Algebraic Topology]]. Grandis also formulates the idea that an [[FQFT|extended QFT]] should be a morphism with domain [[extended cobordism]]s modeled as multi-cospans.

#Definition#

+--{.query}
[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]:

I am proposing a general definition here

* [[multispansJan24b.pdf:file]]

together with some simple examples.

This is related to discussions at the $n$-Caf&eacute; at these places:

* general idea (or not) of multispans [blog](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2007/11/category_theory_and_biology.html#c021530)

* extended cobordisms as multispans [blog](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/05/hopkinslurie_on_baezdolan.html#c021486)

* traces on multispans and co-traces on spans [blog](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/05/hopkinslurie_on_baezdolan.html#c021537)

#Examples#

Special cases of multispans of the above general kind are

* ordinary [[span]]s and [[cospan]]s: these are obtained by restricting the domain poset to be of the form 
$\wedge := a_1 \to \top \leftarrow a_2$.

* the double cospans of the form $\wedge^{\times 2}$ with $\wegde$ as above, described in 

  * Jeffrey Morton, _Double Bicategories and Double Cospans_ ([arXiv](http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/math.CT/0611930)),

 * Grandis' higher cubical cospans, which generalize the previous example: these are obtained by restricting the domain posets to be the cartesian powers
$\wedge^{\times n}$ (with $\wedge$ as above).

#Remarks#

* The concept of multispans as described above is akin to, in fact inspired by or maybe even a realization of the idea of a [[hyperstructure]] by [[Nils Baas]], see [[Cospans in Algebraic Topology]]
