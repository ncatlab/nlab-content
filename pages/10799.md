## Idea

In classical [[algebraic number theory]] one embeds a [[number field]] into the [[cartesian product]] of its [[completion of a ring|completions]] at its [[archimedean absolute values]]. This embedding is very useful in the [[proofs]] of several fundamental [[theorems]]. For example, the algebraic integers in the number field embed discretely and co-compactly into this cartesian product, i.e., as a [[lattice in a vector space|lattice]], and this opens the way for example to the concrete realization of the group of units (modulo torsion) as a lattice, and also to the technique of Fourier analysis where Poisson summation applied to the lattice has classical implications for [[theta functions]] and [[zeta functions]]. 

It was noticed by [[Claude Chevalley]] and [[Andr√© Weil]] that the situation is made even better if the number field itself is embedded in the cartesian product of its completions at all of its absolute values. With a few additional restrictions, these objects are known as the _adeles_, and the [[group of units|units]] of this ring are called the _[[ideles]]_. Under these restrictions, the given number field embeds discretely and cocompactly into the adeles. 

When considering the adeles and ideles, it is their [[topology]] as much as their algebraic structure that is of interest. Many important results in [[number theory]] translate into simple statements about the topologies of the adeles and ideles. For example, the finiteness of the [[ideal class group]] and the [[Dirichlet unit theorem]] are equivalent to a certain quotient of the ideles being compact and discrete.

## Definition

We start off very simply with the algebraic description of the adele ring over the rational numbers. 

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

The ring of _integral adeles_ $\mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{Z}}$ is the [[product]]
of the [[profinite completion of the integers]] $\widehat{\mathbb{Z}}$, with the [[real numbers]]

$$
  \mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{Z}}
  \coloneqq
  \mathbb{R} \times \widehat{\mathbb{Z}}
  \,.
$$

The _adele ring_ is the tensor product $\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{Q} \coloneqq \mathbb{Q} \otimes_\mathbb{Z} \mathbb{A}_\mathbb{Z}$. 
=--

e.g. section 3 [here](http://wiki.epfl.ch/gant/). 

This definition generalizes to any [[number field]] $k$. Let $\mathcal{O} = \mathcal{O}_k$ be the ring of algebraic integers in $k$, and let $P$ be its set of [[places]] (equivalence classes of [[valuations]] of $\mathcal{O}$). Furthermore, let $S$ be the set of archimedean places. 

The completion $k_v$ at each archimedean place $v \in S$ is isomorphic to one of the local fields $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$. The completion $k_v$ for $v \notin S$ is a [[local field]] with an open compact subring $\mathcal{O}_v$ consisting of elements of norm $1$ or less. 

+-- {: .num_defn} 
###### Definition 
The ring of _integral adeles_ $\mathbb{A}_\mathcal{O}$ is the product of the profinite completion $\widehat{\mathcal{O}}$ with the archimedean completions, 

$$\mathbb{A}_\mathcal{O} \coloneqq \widehat{\mathcal{O}} \times \prod_{v \in S} k_v,$$ 

and the _ring of adeles_ over $k$ is the tensor product $\mathbb{A}_k \coloneqq k \otimes_\mathcal{O} \mathbb{A}_\mathcal{O}$. 
=-- 

It may be shown that 

$$\widehat{\mathcal{O}} \cong \prod_{p \notin S} \mathcal{O}_v$$ 

where each non-archimedean place may be identified with a prime ideal $p$. Now, if we view $k$ as the localization of $\mathcal{O}$ obtained by inverting all nonzero elements $x \in \mathcal{O}$, then $k$ may be written as a filtered colimit of a system of inclusions of localizations:  

$$k \cong colim_x \; \mathcal{O}[x^{-1}].$$ 

Componentwise, we may calculate 

$$\array{
\mathcal{O}[x^{-1}] \otimes_\mathcal{O} \mathcal{O}_p & = & k_p & \text{if}\; x \in p \\ 
 & = & \mathcal{O}_p & \text{if}\; x \notin p
}$$ 

and so 

$$\array{
\mathcal{O}[x^{-1}] \otimes_\mathcal{O} \widehat{\mathcal{O}} & \cong & \mathcal{O}[x^{-1}] \otimes_\mathcal{O} \prod_{p \in P \backslash\; S} \mathcal{O}_p \\ 
 & \cong & (\prod_{x \in p} k_p) \times (\prod_{x \notin p} \mathcal{O}_p)
}$$ 

Putting these facts together, 

$$k \otimes_\mathcal{O} \widehat{\mathcal{O}} \cong colim_x\; (\prod_{x \in p} k_p) \times (\prod_{x \notin p} \mathcal{O}_p)$$ 

where each component of the filtered diagram is locally compact in the product topology. Taking the filtered colimit in $Top$ over the resulting diagram of open inclusions, the result is again a locally compact ring. In this way the ring of adeles $\mathbb{A}_k$ is topologized. 

+-- {: .num_remark} 
###### Remark 
The topology on the adele ring $\mathbb{A}_k$ is strictly finer than the subspace topology inherited from its natural inclusion into $\prod_{v \in P} k_v$ with the product topology. For example, $(\prod_{v \in S} k_v) \times \prod_{p \in P \backslash\; S} \mathcal{O}_p$ is open in the ring of adeles, but not in $\prod_{v \in P} k_v$.

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

The [[group of units]] of the ring of adeles $\mathbb{A}_k$ is called the group of [[ideles]], denoted $\mathbb{I}_k$.

=-- 

Under the subspace topology inherited from $\mathbb{A}_k$, there is no reason for inversion $(-)^{-1}: \mathbb{I}_k \to \mathbb{I}_k$ to be continuous (and in fact it isn't!), so $\mathbb{I}_k$ isn't a topological group when topologized this way. However, we can endow $\mathbb{I}_k$ with the subspace topology given by the embedding $\mathbb{I}_k \to \mathbb{A}_k \times \mathbb{A}_k: x \mapsto (x, x^{-1})$; topologized this way, we get a locally compact topological group. _This is the topology on the ideles._ 

Alternatively, for each finite $T \subset P$ containing the set of archimedean places $S$, we have a locally compact group 

$$\mathbb{I}_{k, T} = (\prod_{v \in T} k_v^\times) \times (\prod_{v \notin T} \mathcal{O}_v^\times)$$ 

(noting that each unit group $\mathcal{O}_v^\times$ is compact), and the idele group can be described as the colimit over a filtered system of open inclusions 

$$\mathbb{I}_k = colim_T \; \mathbb{I}_{k, T}$$ 

and indeed the idele topology coincides with the filtered colimit topology. 

## Basic results 

+-- {: .num_prop} 
###### Proposition 
Under the natural inclusion $k \to \mathbb{A}_k$, the subspace topology on $k$ is discrete, and the quotient topology on $\mathbb{A}_k/k$ is compact. 
=-- 

As an additive topological group, there is a natural pairing on $\mathbb{A}_k$: 

$$\langle -, - \rangle: \mathbb{A}_k \times \mathbb{A}_k \to \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z} \cong S^1.$$ 

If $x = (x_v)_{v \in P}$ and $y = (y_v)_{v \in P}$, then 

$$\langle x, y \rangle \coloneqq \prod_v \langle x_v, y_v \rangle_v$$ 

is given by a product of local pairings ... (to be continued).
