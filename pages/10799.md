## Idea

In classical [[algebraic number theory]] one embeds a [[number field]] into the [[cartesian product]] of its [[completions]] at its [[archimedean absolute values]]. This embedding is very useful in the [[proofs]] of several fundamental [[theorems]]. However, it was noticed by [[Claude Chevalley]] and [[Andr√© Weil]] that the situation was improved somewhat if the number field is embedded in the cartesian product of its completions at all of its absolute values. With a few additional restrictions, these objects are known as the _adeles_, and the [[group of units|units]] of this ring are called the _[[ideles]]_.
When considering the adeles and ideles, it is their [[topology]] as much as their algebraic structure that is of interest. Many important results in [[number theory]] translate into simple statements about the topologies of the adeles and ideles. For example, the finiteness of the [[ideal class group]] and the [[Dirichlet unit theorem]] are equivalent to a certain quotient of the ideles being compact and discrete.

## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

The ring of _integral adeles_ $\mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{Z}}$ is the [[product]]
of the [[profinite completion of the integers]] $\widehat{\mathbb{Z}}$, with the [[real numbers]]

$$
  \mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{Z}}
  \coloneqq
  \mathbb{R} \times \widehat{\mathbb{Z}}
  \,.
$$

###### Definition

The [[group of units]] of the ring of adeles is called the group of [[ideles]].
