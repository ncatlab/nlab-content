## Definition

A **coherent category** is a [[regular category]] in which the [[subobject posets]] $Sub(X)$ all have finite [[union]]s which are preserved by the [[base change]] functors $f^*:Sub(Y)\to Sub(X)$.

A [[coherent functor]] serves as a morphism between coherent categories.

The [[internal logic]] of a coherent category is [[coherent logic]].

## Extensivity

Any coherent category automatically has a strict [[initial object]].  Moreover, if an object $X$ is the [[union]] of two subobjects $A\hookrightarrow X$ and $B\hookrightarrow X$ such that $A\cap B = 0$, then $X = A\amalg B$ is their [[coproduct]].  Thus, if every pair of objects can be embedded [[disjoint coproduct|disjointly]] in some third object, then a coherent category has disjoint finite coproducts and is [[extensive category|extensive]] (or "positive").

Extensivity is the analogue for coherent categories of [[exact category|exactness]] for regular categories.  A coherent category which is both extensive and exact is called a [[pretopos]].


## Infinitary versions ##

An **infinitary coherent category** is a [[well-powered category|well-powered]] [[regular category]] in which the subobject posets $Sub(X)$ have all _small_ unions which are [[pullback stability|stable under pullback]].  Infinitary coherent categories are also called __[[geometric category|geometric categories]]__.

[[Mike Shulman]]: I'm starting to feel that well-poweredness shouldn't be included here.  Any thoughts?

See [[familial regularity and exactness]] for a general description of the spectrum from regular categories through finitary and infinitary coherent categories.


## The coherent topology

Any [[coherent category]] $C$ admits a [[subcanonical site|subcanonical]] [[Grothendieck topology]] in which the covering families are generated by finite, jointly [[regular epimorphism|regular-epimorphic]] families: the [[coherent coverage]].  Equivalently, they are generated by single [[regular epimorphisms]] and by finite unions of [[subobject]]s.  If $C$ is [[extensive category|extensive]], then its coherent topology is generated by the regular topology together with the extensive topology.  (In fact, the coherent topology is [[superextensive site|superextensive]].)

If $C$ is a pretopos, then its self-indexing is a [[stack]] for its coherent topology.  Exactness and extensivity are stronger than necessary, however; a pair of necessary and sufficient conditions for this to hold are that
1. If $R\;\rightrightarrows\; A$ is a kernel pair, then for any $f\colon B\to A$, the pullback $f^*R \;\rightrightarrows\; B$ is also a kernel pair (this is equivalent to the [[codomain fibration]] being a stack for the regular topology).
1. If $A,B \rightarrowtail C$ are a pair of subobjects, then for any $f\colon X\to A$ and $g\colon Y\to B$ and any isomorphism $f^*(A\cap B) \cong g^*(A\cap B)$, the pushout
  $$\array{f^*(A\cap B) & \overset{}{\to} & X\\
  \downarrow && \downarrow\\
  Y& \underset{}{\to} & Z}$$
  exists and is also a pullback.

Topoi of sheaves for coherent topologies on coherent categories are called [[coherent topos|coherent topoi]].  (The terminology is slightly confusing, though, because every topos is a coherent category.)


## Making categories coherent

Just like the [[reg/lex completion]], there is a "coh/lex completion" which makes an arbitrary [[finitely complete category]] into a coherent one in a universal way.

Similarly, there are "pretopos completions" analogous to the [[ex/reg completion]] and the [[ex/lex completion]].
