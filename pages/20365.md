Bitcoin with only about 8 transaction per second (TPS) and also big latency times (for final confirmations) is not very suitable for most [[blockchain]] applications. Similarly with most early generation distributed ledgers. Important things for performance include also the efficiency of [[virtual machine]] employed (trend is that the newest projects go toward versions of [[WebAssembly]] VM).

Faster and even scalable solutions are now in works. 
We first describe improvements on Bitcoin and Ethernet 
networks in the form of lightning and plasma networks on top of those, and then various projects which claim to be scalable, "3rd generation" etc. Essential improvements are various algorithms trying to go beyond linearity of classical blockchain projects, especially those relying on DAGs (directed acyclic graphs) and on so called sharding. As far as consensus algorithms there are scalability improvements with many new algorithms, while PoW is in a way most secure (for public blockchains). 

While mining is computationally intensive it is considered that the optimizations with use of GPU and ASIC hardware are bad forces of centralization (not to mention unhealthy and energy consuming chase for success with single purpose hardware). It is considered better to use computational resources for more useful work like validation of smart contracts, security of computation, cryptographic tools for privacy protection and so on. With FPGA the situation is a little better, and some FPGA are claimed to be useful for smart contract processing and alike, see [here](https://www.embedded.com/electronics-blogs/say-what-/4461708/FPGA-based-frameworks-speed-blockchain-processing) there are also Chaincode [[virtual machine]]-specific ASICs by [accelor.io](https://accelor.io).

### Lightning network

Bitcoin solves some of the problems with   so called lightning network on top of it, which makes temporary transactions with lots of intermediate transfers only off chain and only small footprint on the main chain, ensuring small price of transactions.

### Ethernet improvements and plasma 

Ethernet recognizes the same problem as Bitcoin, but has significant plans of substantial upgrades of its Mainnet, namely the new Casper protocol, plans for deployment of [[WebAssembly]] virtual machine and sharding which, according to Buterin, could together bring million TPS when all employed as planned. 

In addition, there is an analogue algorithm to lightning network targeted to Ethereum, with substantial new ideas in the algorithm, called plasma network.

[pdf](https://www.plasma.io/plasma.pdf) draft whitepaper

There are several realizations of plasma, mostly used being the Loom network.

### Projects based on DAGs

There are several major algorithms. Several projects are based on "hashgraph" paper

including [Hedera](https://www.hedera.com/whitepaper) which claims 50000 to 500000 TPS tested,

* Hedera Hashgraph whitepaper [pdf](https://www.hedera.com/hh-whitepaper-v1.5-190219.pdf); intro to whitepaper [web](https://www.hedera.com/whitepaper); 

then so called Consensus project etc.

Somewhat similar but with a new innovative algorithm is [Tolar Hashnet](https://www.tolar.io), see whitepaper [pdf](https://www.tolar.io/static/media/Whitepaper-Tolar.2f13a40e.pdf) with around 150000 TPS achieved on testnet and low power consumption. 

Another kind of scalable algorithms using DAGs is the tangle blockchain (of the [iota](https://www.iota.org) project)

### Telegram Open Network

[Telegram](https://telegram.org) (see [FAQ](https://telegram.org/faq) and [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegram_(messaging_service)) is developing Telegram Open Network (TON) centered around a new generation blockchain project. Besides the blockchain and user interfaces, including on Telegram, it will contain analogues of other parts of the internet structure including TON proxy, TON DNS and TON storage. The blockchain uses delegated proof of stake with a number of innovations including infinite sharding paradigm and instant hypercube rooting. The whitepaper predicts that the platform will be able to support millions of TPS (private access to testnet allegedly given in April 2019).

### RedBelly

Australian academic [RedBelly](https://redbellyblockchain.io) blockchain (also referred as CSIRO) has confirmed 40000 TPS with Amazon platform worldwide testing. Since mid 2017 it had local tests which could achieve up to 400000 but with all nodes in the same location; see the paper about various performance experiments (the largest performance experiment, with measuring various parameters, with up to 1000 nodes in 10 countries!),
