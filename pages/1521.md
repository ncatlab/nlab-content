#Summary#

The article examines in terms of finitized toy examples of [[quantum field theory|quantum field theories]] the suggestion that [[path integral]] quantization of a [[sigma-model|σ-model]] to a [[FQFT|functorial quantum field theory]] 

$$
 Z_\nabla : \Sigma \to Vect
$$

is effectively the [[Kan extension]] of the [[schreiber:Differential Nonabelian Cohomology|differential cocycle]] $\nabla$ on a target space $X$ that describes the background field; the Kan extension being along a bundle $A \to \Sigma$ over parameter space $\Sigma$ (the "worldvolume") which is such that sections $\Sigma \to A$ are the _fields_ of the theory.

$$
  \array{
     && A &\to& X &\stackrel{\nabla}{\to}& Vect
     \\
     &{}^{\phi} \nearrow & \downarrow &&& \nearrow_{Z}
     \\
     \Sigma &\stackrel{Id}{\to}& \Sigma
  }
  \;\;\;
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \array{
     && ext. configuration space &\to& target space &\stackrel{background field}{\to}& space of phases
     \\
     &{}^{field config.}\nearrow & \downarrow &&&& \nearrow_{quantum theory}
     \\
     \Sigma &\stackrel{Id}{\to}& parameter space

The suggestion originates in the trivial remarks 

* [The first part of the story of quantization by pushing to a point](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2007/01/the_first_part_of_the_story_of.html)

where the observation is highlighted that the space of states of the ordinary charged quantum particle -- associated by its quantum propagation functor $Z : Bord_1^{Riem} \to Vect$ assigns to the point -- is nothing but the psuh-forward (i.e. [[Kan extension]]) of the object-part of the fiber-assigning [[schreiber:Differential Nonabelian Cohomology|parallel transport functor]] $\nabla : X \to Vect$ that characterizes the bundle with [[connection]] that describes the background field that the particle is charged under.

Simple as it is, this was an attempt to find a formalization of the indications on the [[n-categorical physics]] behind the [[path integral]] as suggested in

* Dan Freed, _Higher Algebraic Structures and Quantization_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9212115))

as nicely surveyed in section 5.4 of

* [[Bruce Bartlett]], _Categorical Aspects of Topological Quantum Field Theories_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.QA/0512103))

The suggestion that this indicates a more general relation between quantization and push-forward/Kan extension was later formulated vaguely as

* [The n-Cafe Quantum Conjecture](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2007/01/the_first_part_of_the_story_of.html)

It then became clear that in the process of a full quantization by some kind of abstract-nonsense push-forward the [[groupoid cardinality|Leinster measure]] should arise automatically and provide (at least in finite QFT models) the right _weight_ in the path integral

* [Canonical Measures on Configuration Spaces](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2007/03/canonical_measures_on_configur_1.html)

Indeed, the Leinster measure produces not only the right path integral measure for 3-dimensional [[Dijkgraaf-Witten theory]] but also for its 4-dimensional sibling, the Yetter model.

This proposition was stated here

* [comment](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/01/dijkgraafwitten_and_its_catego.html#c014181) to [Dijkgraaf-Witten and its categorification by Martins and Porter](Dijkgraaf-Witten and its Categorification by Martins and Porter).

Since Tom Leinster motivated his measure from considerations of push-forwards of functors to a point, as described by him at

* [comment by Tom Leinster](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2007/02/this_weeks_finds_in_mathematic_5.html#c007497) at [This Week’s Finds in Mathematical Physics (Week 244)](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2007/02/this_weeks_finds_in_mathematic_5.html#c007497)

this seemed like a natural, albeit still vague, indication for the validitiy of the _$n$-Caf&eacute; quantum conjecture_ .  In Johan Alm's computation of the Kan extension the Leinster measure appears automatically as the path integral weight, and in the expected way when applied to Dijkgraaf-Witten theory.

A little later more indications accumulated that the push-forward appearing in the _$n$-Caf&eacute; quantum conjecture_ is the push-part in a pull-push operation, where a quantum [[sigma-model|σ-model]] with target space $X$ and background field $\nabla : X \to V$ classifying a bundle $P \to X$ assigns to a [[cobordism]] [[cospan]] $\Sigma_in \to \Sigma \leftarrow \Sigma_{out}$ the pull-push operation through the [[span]] $[\Sigma_{in},P] \leftarrow [\Sigma, P] \to [\Sigma_{out}, P]$.

A toy example supporting this idea was described as

* [[An Exercise in Groupoidification]]

and then developed into a framework workable in full [[schreiber:Differential Nonabelian Cohomology|differential nonabelian cohomology]] using [[infinity-stack]]s with concrete details for Dijkgraaf-Witten theory worked out in

* [[schreiber:Nonabelian cocycles and their sigma model QFTs|Nonabelian cocycles and their sigma model QFTs]] ,

whose treatment of QFT is structurally similar to that discussed in the context of

* [[geometric infinity-function theory]].

Johan Alm's developing work on quantization as a [[Kan extension]] suggested that there ought to be a reformulation of this pull-push quantization equivalently in terms of Kan extensions. A simple observation for how that might occur was given in

* [[Kanpull.pdf:file]] 

In his latest version Johan Alm now presents an idea for a full proof of this suggested relation.

While Johan Alm was preparing his notes the article

* Daniel S. Freed, Michael J. Hopkins, Jacob Lurie, Constantin Teleman, _Topological Quantum Field Theories from Compact Lie Groups_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.0731))

appeared, which in its section presented ideas about an abstract nonsense formulation of path integrals in finite theories not unsimilar to the ones discussed here. 

For instance the simple example of 1-dimensional [[Dijkgraaf-Witten theory]] appearing on page 3 there is reproduced naturally as a special case of Johan Alm's general abstract Kan extension quantization.
