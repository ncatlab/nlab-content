> The content that used to be here has been superceded. Discussion of quantization in terms of Kan extension and [[pushforward in generalized cohomology]] is now at _[[motivic quantization]]_, with notes being at _[[schreiber:master thesis Nuiten]]_ and _[[schreiber:Quantization via Linear homotopy types]]_ .
