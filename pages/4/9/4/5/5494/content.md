## Idea

The _unordered pair_ of $x$ and $y$, denoted $\{x,y\}$, has the property that $\{x_1,y_1\} = \{x_2,y_2\}$ if and only if $x_1 = x_2$ and $y_1 = y_2$ or $x_1 = y_2$ and $y_1 = x_2$.  In other words, the unordered pair $\{x,y\}$ is the same as the _[[ordered pair]]_ $(x,y)$, except that presentation order does not matter.

## Definition

### In material set theory

In [[material set theory]], an unordered pair is just a [[pair set]]. 

### In structural set theory

In structural set theory]], given a [[set]] $A$, the set of unordered pairs of elements of $A$ is the [[quotient set]] $A \times A / \sim$, where $\sim$ is a [[binary relation]] on $A \times A$ where $(x, y) \sim (y, x)$ for all elements $x \in A$ and $y \in A$. An **unordered pair** is just an element of said quotient set. 

### In type theory

In [[dependent type theory]], let $A$ be an [[h-set]]. Then the type of unordered pairs of elements in $A$ is a [[higher inductive type]] $\mathrm{UnorderedPairs}(A)$ generated by the constructors

* $\{-,-\}:A \times A \to \mathrm{UnorderedPairs}(A)$
* $a:A, b:A \vdash \mathrm{eq}_{\{-,-\}}(a, b):\{a,b\} =_{\mathrm{UnorderedPairs}(A)} \{b,a\}$

## Relation to ordered pairs

The unordered pair $\{x,y\}$ should not be confused with the [[ordered pair]] $(x,y)$. In particular, $\{x,y\} = \{y,x\}$, while $(x,y) \neq (y,x)$ (if $x \neq y$). 

In [[material set theory]], $\{x,y\}$ has a direct definition, but $(x,y)$ must be coded in a complicated way (traditionally as $\big\{\{x\}, \{x,y\}\big\}$). In [[structural set theory]], $(x, y)$ has a direct definition, and $\{x,y\}$ must be coded in a complicated way (traditionally as an element of the quotient set $A \times A / (x, y) \sim (y, x)$). 

However, the two are somewhat related:

*  As just seen, the usual encoding of an ordered pair of [[pure sets]] as a pure set (due to Kuratowski) involves unordered pairs.  Conversely, the set $\big(\!\big({A \atop 2}\big)\!\big)$ of unordered pairs of elements of $A$ may be constructed as a [[quotient set]] of the set $A^2$ of ordered pairs of elements of $A$ (by the [[equivalence relation]] generated by declaring that $(x,y) \sim (y,x)$).
*  Just as unordered pairs (through the [[axiom of pairing]]) are needed to get anywhere in material set theory, so some axiom related to ordered pairs is needed to get anywhere in [[structural set theory]].  (In [[ETCS]], this is the axiom of the ([[Cartesian product|Cartesian]]) [[product]]; in [[SEAR]], this is the axiom of tabulations.)

Despite the name of the [[axiom of pairing]], the term '[[pairing]]' in the $n$Lab usually refers to *ordered* pairs.
