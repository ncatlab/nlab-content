If $G$ is a group and $n \geq 1$ then the [[Eilenberg-Mac Lane]] space $K(G,n)$ is a connected space  with the only non-trivial homotopy group $G$ in dimension $n$. Thus $G$ must necessarily be abelian for $n \geq 2$. 

The construction of such a space can be given for $n \geq 2$ using the standard [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] between chain complexes and simplicial abelian groups: let $C(G,n)$ be the chain complex which is $G$ in dimension $n$ and trivial elsewhere; the geometric realisation of the corresponding simplicial ableian group is then a $K(G,n)$. 

We can include the case $n=1$ when $G$ may be nonabelian, by regarding $C(G,n)$ as a [[crossed complex]]. Its [[classifying space]] $B(C(G,n))$ is then a $K(G,n)$. (This also includes the case $n=0$ when $G$ is just a set!) This method also allows for the construction of $K(M,n;G,1)$ where $G$ is a group, or groupoid,  and $M$ is a $G$-module. This gives a space with $\pi_1 =G$, $\pi_n=M$ all other homotopy trivial, and with the given operation of $\pi_1$ on $\pi_n$.
