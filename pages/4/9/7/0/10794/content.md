## Idea

A _coherent space_ (alias _spectral topological space_) is a [[topological space]] which is [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to the [[spectrum of a commutative ring]], hence to the topological space underlying an [[affine scheme]].

Equivalently, it is a [[compact]] [[sober]] [[topological space]] whose collection of compact open subsets is closed under finite intersections and forms a topological base.

Morphisms of coherent spaces are continuous maps such that preimages of compact open subsets are again compact.

Since coherent spaces are sober, the corresponding [[locale of open subsets]] is a [[coherent locale]]. 

## Stone duality for coherent spaces

Passing from a coherent space to its lattice of compact open subsets establishes a contravariant equivalence from the category of coherent spaces to the category of (bounded) [[distributive lattices]]. Thus, the category of coherent spaces are equivalent to the category of [[Priestley spaces]] and the category of [[coherent locales]]. 

A coherent space is Hausdorff if and only if it is a [[Stone space]]. Under Stone duality for coherent spaces, this corresponds to the fact that in a [[distributive lattice]] $L$ every element has a complement if and only if $L$ is a [[Boolean algebra]].

In particular, restricting the Stone duality equivalence between coherent spaces and distributive lattices to Stone spaces and Boolean algebras recovers the classical Stone duality.
