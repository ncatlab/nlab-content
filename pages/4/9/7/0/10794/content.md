## Idea

A _coherent space_ (alias _spectral topological space_) is a [[topological space]] which is [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to the [[spectrum of a commutative ring]], hence to the topological space underlying an [[affine scheme]].

Equivalently, it is a [[compact]] [[sober]] [[topological space]]
whose collection of compact open subsets is closed under finite intersections and forms a topological base.

Morphisms of coherent spaces are continuous maps
such that preimages of compact open subsets are again compact.

## Stone duality for coherent spaces

Passing from a coherent space to its lattice of compact open subsets
establishes a contravariant equivalence
from the category of coherent spaces
to the category of (bounded) [[distributive lattices]].

A coherent space is Hausdorff if and only if it is a [[Stone space]].
Under Stone duality for coherent spaces,
this corresponds to the fact that in a [[distributive lattice]] $L$
every element has a complement if and only if $L$ is a [[Boolean algebra]].

In particular, restricting the Stone duality equivalence between
coherent spaces and distributive lattices
to Stone spaces and Boolean algebras
recovers the classical Stone duality.

## Coherent locales

A [[locale]] is coherent if its compact elements
are closed under finite meets
and any element is a join of compact elements.

A morphism of coherent locales is a morphism $f$ of [[locales]]
such that $f^*$ preserves compact elements.

Assuming the [[axiom of choice]], coherent locales are
automatically spatial.

The category of coherent locales is contravariantly equivalent
to the category of [[distributive lattices]].
This statement does not depend on the [[axiom of choice]],
unlike the point-set version above.
