In functional analysis, 

* a [[Schwartz space]] is a [[locally convex topological vector space]] $E$ with the property that whenever $U$ is an [[absolutely convex]] neighbourhood of $0$ then it contains another, say $V$, such that $U$ maps to a [[precompact set]] in the [[normed vector space]] $E_V$.

* _the_ Schwartz space of an open subset of Euclidean space is the space of smoooth functions all whose derivative are rapidly decreasing. The [[continuous linear functionals]] on this space are the [[tempered distributions]].
