## Idea


The [[differential geometry]] of [[manifolds]] with [[spin structure]] is called **spin geometry**. It studies [[spin group]]-[[principal bundles]], [[spin representations]], the [[associated bundle|associated]] [[spinor bundles]], and the [[Dirac operators]] acting on [[spaces of sections]] of these bundles, hence also their [[index theory]] and generally [[K-theory]].

## In physics

The relevance of spin geometry in [[physics]] rests on the fact that in [[quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum field theory]] in general and in the [[standard model of particle physics]] in particular, [[fermions]] such as the [[electron]] are mathematically modeled as [[sections]] of spin-bundles. The very term _spin_ originates in the fact that the quanta of these fields behave to some extent as if they had an intrinsic [[angular momentum]], as if they were _spinning_ about an axis as a classical top. 

Spin geometry also plays a central role in supersymmetric quantum field theory such as [[supergravity]].
