## Idea

One calls a [[cyclic group]] of [[order of a group|order]] an [[even number]] $2(n+1)$ ($n \in \mathbb{N}$) a _binary cyclic group_ if one thinks of it as being the [[central extension]] of a cyclic group by the [[group of order 2]]:

$$
  \array{
     \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} &\hookrightarrow& \mathbb{Z}/2(n+1)\mathbb{Z}
     \\ 
     && \downarrow
     \\
     && \mathbb{Z}/(n+1)\mathbb{Z}
  }
$$

This way binary cyclic groups are related to cyclic groups as the [[binary dihedral groups]] are related to the [[dihedral groups]]. Note that if $n+1$ is odd, then the extension is (necessarily) the trivial extension, and if $n+1$ is even, then this extension is the (unique) nontrivial extension. 

From the point of view of the [[classification of finite rotation groups]], the cyclic groups, dihedral groups etc. are the [[finite group|finite]] [[subgroups]] of the [[special orthogonal group]] $SO(3)$, while their binary versions are those subgroups of the [[special unitary group]] $SU(2)$ that arise from the former by taking [[preimages]] under the [[double cover]]-projection $SU(2) \simeq Spin(3) \to SO(3)$.
