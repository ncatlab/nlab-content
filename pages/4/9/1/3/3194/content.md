## Definition

A [[Banach space]] $X$ is **reflexive** if the canonical map $X \to (X^*)^*$ from $X$ to its second dual is an [[isomorphism]] (it is always an [[isometry]] in the presence of [[axiom of choice|Choice]], by the [[Hahnâ€“Banach theorem]]). 


## Properties

## Examples and counterexamples

By the [[Riesz duality theorem]], every [[separable space|separable]] [[Hilbert space]] is reflexive.

The [[Lebesgue space]] $l^1$ is separable in [[dream mathematics]], but in [[classical mathematics]] it is not.

The __James space__ $J$ is the standard example of a separable Banach space such that $J \cong J^{**}$ but $J$ is *not* reflexive.  This follows (after a little work) from the following striking property: the image of $J$ in $J^{**}$ under the canonical map turns out to have codimension $1$ in $J^{**}$.
