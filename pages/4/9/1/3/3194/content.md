A [[Banach space]] $X$ is **reflexive** if the canonical map from $X$ to its second dual is an isomorphism (it is always an isometry in the presence of Choice, by the Hahn-Banach theorem). For example, by the [[Riesz duality theorem]], every [[separable space|separable]] [[Hilbert space]] is reflexive.

The James space $J$ is the standard example of a separable, nonreflexive Banach space such that $J$ is isomorphic to $J^{**}$ - this last fact follows (after a little work) from the following striking property: the image of $J$ in $J^{**}$ under the canonical map turns out to have codimension $1$ in $J^{**}$.
