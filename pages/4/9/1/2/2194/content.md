Let $G$ be a [[abelian group|commutative]] ([[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]]) [[topological group]]. A (continuous) *[[character]]* of $G$ is any continuous homomorphism $\chi:G\to S^1$. The __Pontrjagin dual group__ $\hat{G}$ is the commutative group of all characters of $G$ with pointwise multiplication (that is multiplication induced by multiplication in the [[circle group]], the multiplication of norm-$1$ complex numbers in $S^1\subset\mathbb{C}$) and with the topology of [[uniform convergence]] on each [[compact space|compact]] $K\subset G$ (this is equivalent to the [[compact-open topology]]). 

For example, the Pontrjagin dual of the additive group of [[integer]]s $\mathbb{Z}$ is the circle group $S^1$, and conversely, $\mathbb{Z}$ is the Pontrjagin dual of $S^1$. This pairing of dual topological groups, given by $(n,z) \mapsto z^n$, is related to the subject of [[Fourier series]]. In general, the dual of a [[discrete space|discrete]] group is a [[compact space|compact]] group and conversely. The group $\hat{\mathbb{R}}$ is isomorphic again to $\mathbb{R}$ (the additive group of [[real numbers]]), with the pairing given by $(x,p) \mapsto \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} x p}$; similarly, $\hat{\mathbb{R}^n}$ is isomorphic to the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$.

###### Pontrjagin duality theorem
For every [[locally compact space|locally compact]] (Hausdorff) topological abelian group $G$, the natural function $G\mapsto \widehat{\widehat{G}}$ of $G$ into the Pontrjagin dual of the Pontrjagin dual of $G$, assigning to every $g\in G$ the continuous character $f_g$ given by $f_g(\chi)=\chi(g)$, is an [[isomorphism]] of topological groups (that is a group isomorophism that is also a [[homeomorphism]]).

The [[Fourier transform]] on locally compact abelian groups is formulated in terms of Pontrjagin duals. 

There is a recent categorification of the Pontrjagin duality theorem by U. Bunke and T. Schick, motivated by applications to topological [[T-duality]].
