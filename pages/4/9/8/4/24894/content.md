## Idea

**$\mathbb{R}$-cohesive homotopy type theory** or **real-cohesive homotopy type theory** is a version of [[cohesive homotopy type theory]] which has the [[axiom of real cohesion]]. It provides a [[synthetic mathematics|synthetic]] [[foundation]] for [[topology]], [[real analysis]], [[classical homotopy theory]], and [[algebraic topology]]. 

## Presentation

We assume a [[spatial type theory]] presented with crisp term judgments $a::A$. In addition, we also assume the spatial type theory has a [[Dedekind real numbers]] [[type]] $\mathbb{R}$, and $\mathbb{R}$-[[localization of a type at a family of functions|localizations]] $\mathcal{L}_{\mathbb{R}}(-)$. 

Given a type $A$, let us define $\mathrm{const}_{A, \mathbb{R}}:A \to (\mathbb{R} \to A)$ to be the type of all constant functions in the [[Dedekind real numbers]] $\mathbb{R}$:
$$\delta_{\mathrm{const}_{A, \mathbb{R}}}(a, r):\mathrm{const}_{A, \mathbb{R}}(a)(r) =_A a$$
There is an equivalence $\mathrm{const}_{A, 1}:A \simeq (1 \to A)$ between the type $A$ and the type of functions from the [[unit type]] $1$ to $A$. 
Given types $B$ and $C$ and a function $F:(B \to A) \to (C \to A)$, type $A$ is **$F$-[[localization of a type at a family of functions|local]]** if the function $F:(B \to A) \to (C \to A)$ is an [[equivalence of types]]. 

A crisp type $\Xi \vert () \vdash A$ is **discrete** if the function $(-)_\flat:\flat A \to A$ is an [[equivalence of types]]. 

The **axiom of $\mathbb{R}$-cohesion** states that for the crisp affine line $\Xi \vert () \vdash \mathbb{R} \; \mathrm{type}$, given any crisp type $\Xi \vert () \vdash A \; \mathrm{type}$, $A$ is discrete if and only if $A$ is $(\mathrm{const}_{A, 1}^{-1} \circ \mathrm{const}_{A, \mathbb{R}})$-local. 

This allows us to define discreteness for non-crisp types: a type $A$ is **discrete** if $A$ is $(\mathrm{const}_{A, 1}^{-1} \circ \mathrm{const}_{A, \mathbb{R}})$-local. 

The [[shape modality]] in $\mathbb{R}$-cohesive homotopy type theory is then defined as the $\mathbb{R}$-localization $\esh(A) \coloneqq \mathcal{L}_{\mathbb{R}}(A)$, which ensures that the shape of $\mathbb{R}$ itself is a [[contractible type]].

Note that all uses of axiom T in the above paper can be replaced with the use of the apartness relation of the Dedekind real numbers; i.e. the functions are strongly extensional and $\epsilon$-$\delta$ continuous (theorems 11.5 and 11.6) or the function is apart from the input parameter $f(z) \# z$ (theorems 12.3 and 12.4). 

Also all uses of the axiom of choice in the above paper (theorem 8.27) can be replaced with the use of countable choice or LEM, since those imply theorem 8.29 which is sufficient to prove the Cauchy reals to be Cauchy complete.
