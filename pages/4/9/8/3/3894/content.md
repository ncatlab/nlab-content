A **G-structure** on an $n$-[[manifold]] $M$, for a given structure group $G$, is a $G$-subbundle of the [[frame bundle]] of $M$. 

* For the subgroup of $GL(n, \mathbb{R})$ of matrices of positive determinant, a $GL(n, \mathbb{R})^+$-structure defines an orientation.
* For the orthogonal group, an $O(n)$-structure defines a Riemannian metric.
* For the special linear group, an $SL(n,R)$-structure defines a volume form. 
* For the trivial group, an $\{e\}$-structure consists of an absolute parallelism of the manifold.
* For $n = 2 m$ even, a $GL(m, \mathbb{C})$-structure defines an almost complex structure on the manifold. It must satisfy an integrability condition to be a complex structure.
* $G$ need not be a subgroup of $GL(n, \mathbb{R})$. For example, for the group $spin(n)$, a $G$-structure is a [[spin structure]].

Need to talk about integrability conditions, and those of higher degree. Also need to discuss [[pseudo-group|pseudo-groups]], and relation of all this with [[Cartan geometry]].
