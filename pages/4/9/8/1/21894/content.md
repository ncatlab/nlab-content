## Idea

In most [[projective geometries]], including all classical [[projective spaces]], two distinct [[triangles]] are in a perspective with respect to a point iff they are in a perspective with respect to a line.


## Statement

By a triangle we mean three noncolinear points. 

In a projective space of any dimension greater than 2, in any projective plane over a [[field]] or [[skewfield]], and in every projective plane where the Pappus theorem holds, the following is true. For any two triangles $A B C$ and $A'B'C'$ without common points the three lines $A A'$, $B B'$ and $C C'$ meet in a single point iff the intersections of pairs of sides $A B\cap A'B'$, $A C\cap A' C'$ and $B C\cap B'C'$ lie on a single line. 

## Nondesarguesian planes

In dimension 2, there exist nondesarguesian planes, both finite and infinite (in the sense of a number of points).
All known finite nondesarguesian planes have the order which is a prime number to an integer power bigger than 1.
The [[octonionic projective plane]] is an infinite example.  

## Desarguesian configuration

Desarguesian configuration consists of all 10 points and 10 lines mentioned in the statement, satisfying the condition of the perspective. Thus one includes 6 distinct points $A,B,C,A',B',C'$ such that $A,B,C$ are not colinear, $A',B',C'$ are not colinear and lines $A A'$, $B B'$ and $C C'$ meet in a single point $O$ which is the 7th point; then one adds the three intersections $A B\cap A'B'$, $A C\cap A' C'$ and $B C\cap B'C'$ which should be on the same line $p$. Lines are the three sides of each triangles, the lines $A A'$, $B B'$, $C C'$ and $p$. In higher dimension, the configuration may lay but does not need to lay on a single plane.
