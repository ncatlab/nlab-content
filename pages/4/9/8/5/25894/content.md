## Definition

A **category with path objects** or a **path category** is a [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$ with two sets of morphisms called [[weak equivalences]] and [[fibrations]] in which

1. Fibrations are closed under composition
1. The pullback of a fibration along any other map exists and is again a fibration.
1. The pullback of an [[acylic fibration]] along any other map is again an acyclic fibration.
1. Weak equivalences satisfy the 2-out-of-6 property: if $f:A \to B$, $g:B \to C$, $h:C \to D$ are
three composable maps and both $g \circ f$ and $h \circ g$ are weak equivalences, then so are $f$, $g$, $h$ and $h \circ g \circ f$.
1. Isomorphisms are acyclic fibrations and every acyclic fibration has a section.
1. For any object $B$ there is a path object $P B$ (not necessarily functorial in $B$).
1. $\mathcal{C}$ has a terminal object $1$ and every map $X \to 1$ to the terminal object is a fibration.

##Â Examples

* The [[syntactic category]] associated to a [[dependent type theory]] with [[identity types]] is a category with path objects. 

* Given a [[Quillen model category]] $\mathcal{C}$ in which every object is cofibrant, the [[full subcategory]] of fibrant objects in $\mathcal{C}$ is a category with path objects. 

* The category of [[topological spaces]] is a category with path objects where the [[homotopy equivalences]] are the weak equivalences and the [[Hurewicz fibrations]] are the the fibrations. 

* A [[finitely complete category]] is a category with path objects in which every morphism is a fibration and only the [[isomorphisms]] are [[weak equivalences]].
