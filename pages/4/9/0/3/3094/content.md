A [[topological space|topology]] $\tau_Y$ (in Bourbaki sense) on a set $Y$ is said to be the topology **induced** by the set inclusion $Y\subset X$, where $(X,\tau_X)$ is a given topological space, if $\tau_Y = \tau_X\cap Y = \{ U\cap Y | U\in\tau_X\}$. The pair $(Y,\tau_Y)$ is then said to be a *topological [[subspace]]* of $(X,\tau_X)$. Induced topology is for that reason sometimes called the **subspace topology** on $Y$. 

A property of topological spaces is said to be **hereditary** if its satisfaction for a topological space $X$ implies its satisfaction for all topological subspaces of $X$. 

However there is also a notion of a [[Grothendieck topology]] induced along a functor from a Grothendieck topology on other category (actually the input can be somewhat more general coverage, then the topology induced along the identity functor will serve as a sort of a completion). (this will be explained later).
