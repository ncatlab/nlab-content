## Idea

In [[topology]], given a [[covering space]] $E \to X$, then  the elements of the set $F$ for $E\vert_U \simeq U \times F$ are called the _leaves_ over the covering.

In [[differential geometry]], a  [[foliation]] consists of [[submanifolds]]. Each of them is called a _leaf_ of the foliation.

In [[combinatorics]], the ends of [[trees]] are called "leaves".
