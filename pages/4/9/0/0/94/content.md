## Idea ##

$L_\infty$-algebras are a [[vertical categorification]] of Lie algebras: in an $L_\infty$-algebra the Jacobi identity is allowed to hold only up to higher coherent homotopy. 

From another perspective: an $L_\infty$-algebra is a [[Lie infinity-algebroid]] with a single object.

## Definition ##

An **$L_\infty$-algebra** is 

* an $\mathbb{N}$-graded vector space $\mathfrak{g}$;

* equipped with a differential $D : \vee^\bullet \mathfrak{g} \to \vee^\bullet \mathfrak{g}$ of degree $-1$ on the [[free graded co-commutative coalgebra]] over $\mathfrak{g}$.

### Remarks ###

Using the fact that coderivations on free coalgebras are already fixed by their action on "cogenerators", i.e. by their preimage in $V$, one can decompose this $D$ into it $k$-ary components
$$
  D = D_1 + D_2 + D_3 + \cdots
  \,.
$$
In terms of these the condition $D^2 = 0$ is a somewhat complicated looking condition. In terms of this condition $L_\infty$-algebras had been originally conceived.


## Special cases and generalizations ##

* An $L_\infty$-algebra for which $V$ is concentrated in the first $n$ degree is a **Lie $n$-algebra** (sometimes also: "$L_n$-algebra").

* The skew-symmetry of the Lie bracket is retained strictly in $L_\infty$-algebras. It is expected that weakening this, too, yields a more general [[vertical categorification]] of Lie algebras. For $n=2$ this has been worked out by Dmitry Roytenberg: [On weak Lie 2-algebras](http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.3461).

* The [[horizontal categorification]] of $L_\infty$-algebras are $L_\infty$-[[Lie infinity-algebroid|algebroid]]s.

* An $L_\infty$-algebra with only $D_n$ non-vanishing is called an **[[n-Lie algebra]]** -- to be distinguished from a _Lie $n$-algebra_ ! However, in large parts of the literature $n$-Lie algebras are considered for which $D_n$ is _not_ of the required homogeneous degree in the grading, or in which no grading is considered in the first place. Such $n$-Lie algebras are not special examples of $L_\infty$-algebras, then. For more see [[n-Lie algebra]].
