#Idea#

$L_\infty$-algebras are a [[vertical categorification]] of Lie algebras: in an $L_\infty$-algebra the Jacobi identity is allowed to hold only up to higher coherent homotopy. 


#Definition#

The quickest definition is:

an $L_\infty$-algebra is a degree -1 coderivation 
$D : \vee V \to \vee V$ on the free graded co-commutatuive algebra $V$ generated from a $\mathbb{N}$-grade vector space $V$ such that $D^2 = 0$.

Using the fact that coderivations on free coalgebras are already fixed by their action on "cogenerators", i.e. by their preimage in $V$, one can decompose this $D$ into it $k$-ary components
$$
  D = D_1 + D_2 + D_3 + \cdots
  \,.
$$
In terms of these the condition $D^2 = 0$ is a somewhat complicated looking condition. In terms of this condition $L_\infty$-algebras had been originally conceived.


#Special cases and generalizations#

* An $L_\infty$-algebra for which $V$ is concentrated in the first $n$ degree is a **Lie $n$-algebra**.

* An $L_\infty$-algebra in which only $D_n$ is nontrivial is an **$n$-Lie algebra**. But beware: in the literature on $n$-Lie algebras the condition that $D_n$ is of homogeneous degree -1 is often dropped.

* The skew-symmetry of the Lie bracket is retained strictly in $L_\infty$-algebras. It is expected that weakening this, too, yields a more general [[vertical categorification]] of Lie algebras. For $n=2$ this has been worked out by Dmitry Roytenberg: [On weak Lie 2-algebras](http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.3461).

* The [[horizontal categorification]] of $L_\infty$-algebras are [[L-infinity algebroid]]s.
