## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A [[homotopy type]] is called _finite_ if it is presented (via the discussion at _[[homotopy hypothesis]]_) by either

* a [[simplicial set]] with a [[finite number]] of non-degenerate [[simplices]];

* a [[CW-complex]] with a [[finite number]] of [[cell complex|cells]].

###### Remark

Similarly a [[spectrum]] ([[stable homotopy type]]) given by a sequence of finite homotopy types is called a _[[finite spectrum]]_.

###### Remark

Beware that a finite homotopy type in general does not have finite and finitely many [[homotopy groups]] (see e.g. at [[homotopy groups of spheres]]). Homotopy types with finite and finitely many homotopy groups have alternatively been called _$\pi$-finite_, or _[[groupoid cardinality|tame]]_, or (adapted from [[homological algebra]]) "of [[finite type]]" (which needs to be carefully distinguishes, therefore, from "finite homotopy type"). 
See at _[[homotopy type with finite homotopy groups]]_.

## Properties

### Relation to compact homotopy type

The [[compact object in an (infinity,1)-category|compact objects]]in [[âˆžGrpd]] are the [[retracts]] of finite homotopy types. Not every such retract is itself a finite homotopy type; the vanishing of [[Wall's finiteness obstruction]] is a necessary and sufficient condition for this to happen.
