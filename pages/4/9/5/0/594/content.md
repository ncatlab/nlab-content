## Definition

A **union** is a [[join]] of [[subset]]s or (more generally) [[subobject]]s.  This includes the traditional [[set theory|set-theoretic]] union of subsets of some ambient set.

The [[duality|dual]] notion is that of [[intersection]]/[[meet]].

Unions of completely arbitrary sets make sense only in [[material set theory]], where their existence is guaranteed by the [[axiom of union]].  In [[structural set theory]], unions of arbitrary sets can generally be replaced by [[disjoint unions]], and unions of arbitrary [[subsets]] are represented by [[wide pushouts]] of the corresponding [[injections]] from the [[intersection]] of the subsets. 

A [[coherent category]] is one having well-behaved finite unions of subobjects, and an [[infinitary coherent category]] is one having all well-behaved small unions of subobjects. 

## Properties

* For [[subsets]]: [[images preserve unions]], [[pre-images preserve unions and intersections]]. See at _[[interactions of images and pre-images with unions and intersections]]_.
