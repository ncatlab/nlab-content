A **union** (also called a **join** or **supremum**) is a [[coproduct]] in a [[poset]].

Unions are often considered in the posets of [[subobject]]s of an object of some category.  When applied in [[Set]], this includes the traditional union of subsets of some ambient set.  A [[coherent category]] is one having well-behaved unions of subobjects.
