## Idea

_Higher Cartan geometry_ is supposed to be the generalization of [[Cartan geometry]] to [[higher geometry]]; the globalized version of [[higher Klein geometry]].

A formalization in the context of [[differential cohesion|differential]] [[cohesive]] [[homotopy theory]] is in [[schreiber:differential cohomology in a cohesive topos|dcct]]. 



## Examples

### Higher Cartan super-Poincar&#233;-geometry

Notice that ordinary [[gravity]] can be understood as the theory of $(O(d,1) \hookrightarrow Iso(d,1))$-[[Cartan geometry]], where $Iso(d,1)$ is the [[Poincare group]] and $O(d,1)$ the [[orthogonal group]] of [[Minkowski space]]. This is called the [[first order formulation of gravity]].

One can read the [[D'Auria-Fre formulation of supergravity]] as saying that higher dimensional [[supergravity]] is analogously given by higher Cartan supergeometry. See there and see the examples at [[higher Klein geometry]] for more on this.
