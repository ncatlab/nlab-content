## Idea

In [[probability theory]], *zero-one laws* are conditions for which a certain [[probability measure]] can only assume the values [[zero]] and [[one]] (i.e. it is a [[zero-one measure]]).

Very often they can be seen as conditions for which a probability measure, usually an [[iid measure|iid one]], is [[ergodic]] (that is, it is [[zero-one measure|zero-one]] on the [[invariant sets]] of some [[action]]). 


## Statements

### Hewitt-Savage zero-one law

Let $(X,p)$ be a [[probability space]]. Consider the infinite product $X^\mathbb{N}$, and form the [[iid measure]] $\tilde{p}$ on $X^\mathbb{N}$ whose [[marginals]] are given by $p$. 

Then for every [[exchangeable event]] $A\subseteq X^\mathbb{N}$ we have that either $\tilde{p}(A)=0$ or $\tilde{p}(A)=1$.
That is, $\tilde{p}$ restricted to the [[exchangeable sigma-algebra]] is a [[zero-one measure]]. 

(The equivalent characterizations of [[zero-one measures]] give equivalent formulations of this statement.)


### Kolmogorov's zero-one law

Let $(X,p)$ be a [[probability space]]. Consider the infinite product $X^\mathbb{N}$, and form the [[iid measure]] $\tilde{p}$ on $X^\mathbb{N}$ whose [[marginals]] are given by $p$. 

Then for every [[tail event]] $A\subseteq X^\mathbb{N}$ we have that either $\tilde{p}(A)=0$ or $\tilde{p}(A)=1$.
That is, $\tilde{p}$ restricted to the [[tail sigma-algebra]] is a [[zero-one measure]]. 

(The equivalent characterizations of [[zero-one measures]] give equivalent formulations of this statement.)
