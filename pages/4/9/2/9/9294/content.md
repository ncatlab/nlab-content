## Idea

The identification of [[particle]] species with [[irreducible representation|irreducible]] [[unitary representations]] of the [[symmetry group]] acting on [[matter]] [[field (physics)|fields]] over [[spacetime]]. Named after [[Eugene Wigner]].

For details see at 

* _[[unitary representation of the Poincaré group]]_.

* _[[unitary representation of the super Poincaré group]]_.

It uses a method that goes back to Frobenius and came to be known as "Wigner's little group method" or the "[[Mackey theory]]" (going back to [Mackey 1968](#Mackey68)).

The observation that Wigner's representations $U_{(-)}$ are those for which all the maps $g \mapsto \langle \Phi \vert U_g \Psi \rangle$ are [[measurable function|measurable]] and their correspondence of irreducible unitary representations to [[induced representations]] of irreps of the [[stabilizer group]] of a given momentum is due to
