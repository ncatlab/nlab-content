## Idea
 {#Idea}

For $C$ a [[cartesian monoidal category]] (a category with [[finite products]]), an *internal ring* or a *ring object* in $C$ is an [[internalization]] to the category $C$ of the notion of a [[ring]].

Under some reasonable assumptions on $C$ that allow one to construct a ([[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]]) [[monoidal category|monoidal]] [[tensor product]] on the [[category]] of [[abelian group|abelian]] [[group objects]] $Ab(C)$ [[internalization|internal]] to $C$, a ring object can also be defined as a [[monoid object]] internal to that monoidal category $Ab(C)$. 

Sometimes one might take this last point of view a little further, especially in certain contexts of [[stable homotopy theory]] where a [[stable (∞,1)-category]] of [[spectra]] is already something like an [[(∞,1)-category]]-analogue of a [[category of abelian groups]]. With the understanding that a [[symmetric smash product of spectra]] plays a role analogous to [[tensor products of abelian groups]], monoids with respect to the [[smash product]] are often referred to as "$xyz$-rings" of one sort or another (as mentioned at "[[ring operad]]"). Thus we have carry-over phrases from the early days of stable homotopy theory, such as "[[A-∞ rings]]" (for monoids) and "[[E-∞ rings]]" (commutative monoids). Here it is understood that the monoid multiplication on spectra is an $(\infty, 1)$-refinement of a multiplicative structure on a corresponding [[cohomology theory]], with various forms of [[K-theory]] providing archetypal examples. 


## Definition 
 {#Definition}

### Traditional definition

The traditional definition, based on a traditional presentation of the [[equational theory]] of rings, is that a ring object consists of an object $R$ in a [[cartesian monoidal category]] $C$ together with morphisms $a: R \times R \to R$ (addition), $m: R \times R \to R$ (multiplication), $0: 1 \to R$ (zero), $e: 1 \to R$ (multiplicative identity), $-: R \to R$ (additive inversion), subject to [[commutative diagrams]] in $C$ that express the usual ring axioms. 

### As a model of a Lawvere theory
 {#AsAModelOfALawvereTheory}

Let $T$ be the [[Lawvere theory]] for rings, viz. the category [[opposite category|opposite]] to the category of [[finitely generated object|finitely generated]] [[free object|free]] rings (which are non-commutative [[polynomial rings]] $\mathbb{Z}\langle X_1, \ldots, X_n\rangle$) and ring maps between them. Then for $C$ a category with finite products, a _ring object_ in $C$ may be identified with a product-preserving functor $T \to C$. 

### Via the microcosm principle
 {#ViaTheMicrocosmPrinciple}

Alternatively, one may define ring objects following the Baez–Dolan [[microcosm principle]]. Indeed, similarly to how it is possible to define monoids in a monoidal category (a pseudomonoid in $(\mathsf{Cat},\times,\mathsf{pt})$), it is possible to speak of rig objects internal to any [[bimonoidal category]] (a pseudomonoid in $(\mathsf{SymMonCats},\otimes_{\mathbb{F}},\mathbb{F})$).

Namely, a **rig in a [[bimonoidal category]]** $(\mathcal{C},\otimes_{\mathcal{C}},\oplus_{\mathcal{C}},\mathbf{0}_{\mathcal{C}},\mathbf{1}_{\mathcal{C}})$ is given by a quintuple $(R,\mu^{+}_{R},\eta^{+}_{R},\mu^{\times}_{R},\eta^{\times}_{R})$ consisting of

  - An object $R$ of $\mathcal{C}$, called the **underlying object** of the rig;
  - A morphism
    $$\mu^{+}_{R}\colon R\oplus_{\mathcal{C}}R\longrightarrow R$$
    of $\mathcal{C}$, called the **addition morphism of $R$**;
  - A morphism
    $$\mu^{\times}_{R}\colon R\otimes_{\mathcal{C}}R\longrightarrow R$$
    of $\mathcal{C}$, called the **multiplication morphism of $R$**;
  - A morphism
    $$\eta^{+}_{R}\colon\mathbf{0}_{\mathcal{C}}\longrightarrow R$$
    of $\mathcal{C}$, called the **additive unit morphism of $R$**;
  - A morphism
    $$\eta^{\times}_{R}\colon\mathbf{1}_{\mathcal{C}}\longrightarrow R$$
    of $\mathcal{C}$, called the **multiplicative unit morphism of $R$**;

satisfying the following conditions:

  1. The triple $(R,\mu^{+}_R,\eta^{+}_R)$ is a [[commutative monoid in a symmetric monoidal category | commutative monoid in $\mathcal{C}$]];
  2. The triple $(R,\mu^{\times}_R,\eta^{\times}_R)$ is a [[monoid in a monoidal category | monoid in $\mathcal{C}$]];
  3. The diagrams

         "file_name": "semiring_in_bimonoidal_bilinearity_1.png",
         "width": 800
     \end{imagefromfile}
 
     corresponding to the rig axioms $a(b+c)=a b+a c$ and $(a+b)c=a c+b c$ commute;
  4. The diagrams

     \begin{imagefromfile}
         "file_name": "semiring_in_bimonoidal_bilinearity_2_corr.png",
         "width": 500
     \end{imagefromfile}

     corresponding to the rig axioms $0a=0$ and $a0=0$ commute;

Moreover, for $\mathcal{C}$ a _braided_ bimonoidal category, one defines a **commutative rig in $\mathcal{C}$** to be a rig in $\mathcal{C}$ whose multiplicative monoid structure is commutative.

A partial version of this definition first appeared in ([Brun 2006, Definition 5.1](#Brun2006)).

## Examples

* A ring object in [[Top]] is a [[topological ring]].

* A ring object in [[Ho(Top)]] is an [[H-ring]].

* A [[topos]] equipped with a ring object is called a [[ringed topos]], see there for more details.

* The [[affine line]] (see there) is a ring object in the given ambient [[topos]].

For the notion of a rig in a [[bimonoidal category]] [defined via the microcosm principle](#ViaTheMicrocosmPrinciple), we have the following examples.

 * A rig in $\left(\mathsf{Sets},\coprod,\times,\emptyset,\times\right)$ is a monoid.
 * A rig in $\left(\mathsf{CMon},\oplus,\otimes_\mathbb{N},0,\mathbb{N}\right)$ is a rig.
 * A rig in $\left(\mathsf{Ab},  \oplus,\otimes_\mathbb{Z},0,\mathbb{Z}\right)$ is a ring.
 * A rig in $\left(\mathsf{Mod}_R,\oplus,\otimes_R,0,R\right)$ is an associative algebra.
 * A rig in $\left(\mathsf{Cats},\coprod,\times,\emptyset_{\mathsf{cat}},\mathsf{pt}\right)$ is a strict monoidal category.
