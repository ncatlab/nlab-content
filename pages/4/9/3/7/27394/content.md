## Idea

A version of a [[principal ideal domain]] where the [[commutative ring]] is not required to be an [[integral domain]]. 

## Definition

A [[commutative ring]] $R$ is a **principal ideal ring** if every [[ideal]] in $R$ is a [[principal ideal]], or equivalently that the set of ideals is [[isomorphic]] to the quotient multiplicative monoid $R / R^\times$. 

## Examples

* Every [[principal ideal domain]] is a principal ideal ring. 

* Given a [[prime number]] $p$ and natural number $n \gt 1$, the [[prime power local ring]] $\mathrm{Z} / (p^n)$ is a principal ideal ring where the [[zero divisors]] form a principal ideal generated by $p$.
