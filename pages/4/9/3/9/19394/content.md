## Idea

In [[string theory]], specifically in [[type IIA string theory]], the [[brane intersection]] of a [[D2-brane]] with an [[O8-plane]] is called an _E-string_. The [[M-theory]] lift of this is the [[brane intersection]] of an [[M2-brane]] with an [[M9-brane]] which [[wrapped brane|wraps]] the M-theory circle fiber, hence an $M9_I$-brane of [[Horava-Witten theory]] ([KKLPV 14, p. 4/5](#KKLPV14)), hence a [[D8-brane]] from the [[duality between type IIA string theory and M-theory|dual perspective]] of [[type I' string theory]].

Hence under the [[S-duality]] [[duality between type I and heterotic string theory|between type I and heterotic string theory]] the E-string is [[duality in string theory|dual]] to the [[heterotic string]].
