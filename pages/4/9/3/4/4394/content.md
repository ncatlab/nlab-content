## Definitions

Recall that a [[topological space]] is a [[set]] equipped with a [[topological structure]].  Well, a __bitopological space__ is simply a set equipped with *two* topological strucutres.  Unlike with [[bialgebras]], no compatibility condition is required between these structures.

A __bicontinous map__ is a [[function]] between bitopological spaces that is [[continuous map|continuous]] with respect to each topological structures.

Bitopological spaces and bicontinuous maps form a [[category]] $Bitop$.


## Remarks

It is interesting and perhaps surprising that many advanced topological notions can be described using bitopological spaces, even when you would not na&#239;vely think that there are two topologies around.  (At least, that\'s my vague memory of what they were good for.  I think that this was in some book by Isbell.)
