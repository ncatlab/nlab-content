Due to decay, an unstable quantum-mechanical system cannot be in the eigenstate of the Hamiltonian. Effectively, this means that the system is described by a wave-packet which ranges over a distribution of energies (or frequencies, as in the field of spectroscopy). In the simplest model of an exponential decay, the distribution of energies is given by
so called Breit-Wigner distribution (and to some extent this is true for
most short-living metastable system, e.g. resonances in high energy physics). 

Given some quantities $E_0$ and $\Gamma$ of the dimension of energy the __Breit-Wigner energy distribution__

$$
|\rho(E)|^2 = \frac{\Gamma/2\pi}{\frac{1}{2}\Gamma^2+(E-E_0)^2}
$$

which should be in principle damped all the way to $0$ from some energy $E_{min}$ as the spectrum of any Hamiltonian must be bounded below. The plot of the Breit-Wigner curve as seen in spectroscopy is often called Breit-Wigner curve.

Various effects in nature lead to modifed, asymmetric and other spectral curves to which the Breit-Wigner is merely the crudest approximation.
