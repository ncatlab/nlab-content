## Idea

The _May spectral sequence_ is [[spectral sequence]] used to compute the first page of the [[Adams spectral sequence]].

It can be regarded as the spectrral sequence obtained by filtering the (dual) [[Steenrod algebra]] by (co)powers of the unit (co)ideal. ([Ravenel, chapter 3, section 2](#Ravenel))
