## Idea

A **differental graded ring** or **dg-ring** is a [[monoid]] in the [[category]] of [[chain complexes]] or of [[cochain complex]]es of abelian groups. 

If a dg-ring is degreewise compatibly a [[vector space]] (or more generally a [[module]] over some [[ring]]) then it is called *[[dg-algebra]]*. See there for more.
