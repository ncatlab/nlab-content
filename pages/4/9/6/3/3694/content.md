An **ordinary differential equation** is a [[differential equation]] involving derivatives of a function with respect to one argument only. The same for systems: there can be several functions, but all the derivatives are with respect to the same argument (in all equations).  In other words, we are looking at maps on a [[manifold]] of only $1$ [[dimension]].
