## As a synonym for morphism

The term _arrow_ is sometimes used as a synonym for _[[morphism]]_, _[[map]]_, and also for directed edge (in a [[directed graph]] or [[quiver]]).

Abbreviations for the class of all arrows of a category $\mathsf{C}$ used in the literature include $\mathrm{Arr}(\mathsf{C})$, $\mathrm{Ar}(\mathsf{C})$, and $\mathrm{Mor}(\mathsf{C})$.  Note that this is the class of [[objects]] of the [[arrow category]] of $\mathsf{C}$, and the same notations are sometimes used for that whole category.

## In computer science

In [[computer science]] it may also refer to a concept generalizing [[monad (in computer science)|monads]], see at _[[arrow (in computer science)]]_.

Arrows may be viewed as [[relative monad|monads relative to]] the [[Yoneda embedding]], or equivalently as monads in the [[bicategory]] of [[profunctors]].
