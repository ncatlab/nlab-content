## Idea 

The [[type theory|type-theoretic]] version of the fact that in [[set theory]] [[functions]] preserve [[equality]] between [[elements]] in [[sets]]. 

## Definition 

### Basic definition

In [[dependent type theory]], given [[types]] $A$ and $B$ and a [[function type|function]] $x  \colon A \vdash f(x) \colon B$, there is induced a [[dependent function]] between the corresponding [[identity types]]

$$
  a \colon A
  ,\,\;
  b\colon A 
  ,\,\;
  p 
    \,\colon\, 
  a =_A b 
  \;\;\;\vdash\;\;\; 
  \mathrm{ap}_f(a, b)(p)
  \;\colon\;
  f(a) =_B f(b)
$$ 

defined by [[Id-induction]] from 

$$
  ap_f\big(refl_a\big) \,\equiv\, refl_{f(a)}
$$

and called the **application** or **action** of $f$ to/on [[identities]]/[[identifications]]/[[equalities]]/[[paths]] &lbrack;e.g. [UFP (2013, p. 69)](#UFP13), [Rijke (2022, §5.3)](#Rijke22)&rbrack;.

{#Functoriality} By repeated [[Id-induction]] it readily follows,  stagewise (e.g. [UFP13, Lem 2.2.1](#UFP13)), that $ap_f$ respects the [[concatenation]], and the [[inverse|inversion]] of [[identifications]], up to [[coherence|coherent]] higher-order identifications, hence that it acts as an [[infinity-functor|$\infty$-functor]] on the  [[infinity-groupoid|$\infty$-groupoid]]-[[structure]] on homotopy types :

### Relation to dependent function application to identifications

The function application to identifications is a special case of the [[dependent function application to identifications]] for which the type family $x:A \vdash B$ is a constant type family, and thus the [[dependent identity type]] $f(a) =_B^p f(b)$ doesn't depend on the path $p:a =_A b$ and is thus a normal identity type $f(a) =_B f(b)$. 

### Inductive definition

If the function application to identifications is inductively defined, then it comes with rules saying that the following judgment can be formed 
$$a:A \vdash \mathrm{ap}_{f}(a, a)(\mathrm{refl}_{A}(a)) \equiv \mathrm{refl}_{B}(f(a)):\Omega(B, f(a))$$
where $\Omega(A, a)$ is the [[loop space type]] $a =_A a$ of $A$ at $a:A$. 

## For functions of arbitrary arity

### Binary function applications to identifications

Given types $A$, $B$, and $C$ and a [[binary function]] $x:A, y:B \vdash f(x, y):C$, there is a dependent function 
$$a:A, a':A, b:B, b':B, p:a =_A a', q:b =_B b' \vdash \mathrm{apbinary}_f(a, a', b, b')(p, q):f(a, b) =_C f(a', b')$$ 
called the **binary function application to identifications** or **binary action on identifications** ([Rijke (2022), §19.5](#Rijke22)), inductively defined by 
$$a:A, b:B \vdash \mathrm{apbinary}_{f}(a, a, b, b)(\mathrm{refl}_{A}(a), \mathrm{refl}_{B}(b)) \equiv \mathrm{refl}_{C}(f(a, b)):\Omega(C, f(a, b))$$
where $\Omega(A, a)$ is the [[loop space type]] $a =_A a$ of $A$ at $a:A$. 

Binary function applications to identifications are used in proving [[product extensionality]] for [[product types]], as well as defining multiplication on the [[integers]] $\mathrm{apbinary}_{\mu}:\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}$ from multiplication on the [[circle type]] $\mu:S^1 \times S^1 \to S^1$ when the integers are defined as the [[loop space type]] of the element $\mathrm{base}:S^1$, $\mathbb{Z} \coloneqq \Omega(S^1, \mathrm{base})$. 

### Finitary function application to identifications

Let $n$ be a natural number, let $A$ be a family of types indexed by the [[finite type]] with $n$ elements $\mathrm{Fin}(n)$, and let $B$ be a type. Then given a function 
$$n:\mathbb{N}, x:\left(\prod_{i:\mathrm{Fin}(n)} A(i)\right) \vdash f(x):B$$ 
there is a dependent function 
$$n:\mathbb{N}, a:\prod_{i:\mathrm{Fin}(n)} A(i), b:\prod_{i:\mathrm{Fin}(n)} A(i) \vdash \mathrm{ap}_f(n)(a, b):\left(\prod_{i:\mathrm{Fin}(n)} a(i) =_{A(i)} b(i)\right) \to f(a) =_{B} f(b)$$

## For identifications of arbitrary arity

One can also consider function application to [[identification#OfArbitraryArity|identifications of arity]] $I$, $p:\mathrm{Id}_{I, A}(\overline{x})$, given a family of elements $\overline{x}:I \to A$ indexed by type $I$. We have, for a function $f:A \to B$, a reflexive family 

$$x:A \vdash \mathrm{refl}_{I, B}(f(x)):\mathrm{Id}_{I, B}(\lambda t.f(x))$$

and thus by [[identification induction]] of the [[identity type#OfArbitraryArity|identity type of arity]] $I$, we have a function 

$$\mathrm{ap}_{I, A, B}(f, \overline{x}):\mathrm{Id}_{I, A}(\overline{x}) \to \mathrm{Id}_{I, B}(\lambda t.f(\overline{x}(t)))$$

called the **application** of function $f$ to identifications of arity $I$ or the **action** of function $f$ on identifications of arity $I$, such that for all $x:A$, 

$$\mathrm{ap}_{I, A, B}(f, \overline{x}, \mathrm{refl}_{I, A}(x) \equiv \mathrm{refl}_{I, B}(f(x)):\mathrm{Id}_{I, B}(\lambda t.f(x))$$
