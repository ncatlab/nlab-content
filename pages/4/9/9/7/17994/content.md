The _universal complex line bundle_ is the [[complex vector bundle|complex]] [[universal vector bundle]] of [[rank]] 1, hence the [[complex line bundle]] which is [[associated bundle|associated]] to the [[circle group]]-[[universal principal bundle]] $E U(1)$ over the [[classifying space]] $B U(1)$ via the canonical [[action]] of $U(1)$ on $\mathbb{C}$.
