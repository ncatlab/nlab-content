## Definition

If $X$ is a [[locally compact group|locally compact]] [[Hausdorff topological space]], a __Radon measure__ on $X$ is a [[Borel measure]] on $X$ that is 

* finite on all [[compact subsets]],

* outer regular (i.e. can be approximated from outside by measure on the [[open sets]]) on all [[Borel sets]], and

* inner regular (i.e. can be approximated from inside by a measure on compact sets) on [[open subset|open sets]]. 


## Properties

* If a Radon measure is $\sigma$-finite then it is regular (i.e. both inner and outer regular) on all Borel subsets. 

* A Radon measure on a [[Hausdorff space]] is [[τ-additive]]. The converse is true on a [[compact Hausdorff space]].

* Radon [[probability measures]] on [[compact Hausdorff spaces]] form a [[monad]]: the [[Radon monad]]. Just as well, Radon probability measures of finite first moment on [[complete metric spaces]] give the [[Kantorovich monad]]. 

(See also [[monads of probability, measures and valuations]].)

## Examples

Most measures of interest in [[geometry]] are Radon. For example

* The [[Dirac measures]].

* The [[Lebesgue measure]] on the real line.

* The measure associated to a [[volume form]] on a Riemannian manifold.

* The left (right) [[Haar measure]] on a [[locally compact topological group]] is a nonzero Radon measure which is invariant under left (right) multiplications by elements in the group.
