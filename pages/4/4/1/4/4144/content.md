## Idea

_Syntomic cohomology_ is the [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] of the _syntomic site_ of a [[scheme]].
It is a $p$-[[p-adic|adic]] analogue of [[Deligne-Beilinson cohomology]].

It is closely related to the [[crystalline cohomology]] of that scheme. It may be regarded as a $p$-adic [[absolute Hodge cohomology]].

## Related

* [[Deligne-Beilinson cohomology]]
* [[p-adic Hodge theory]]

## References

The syntomic site was introduced in

* Jean-Marc Fontaine and [[William Messing]], _$p$-Adic periods and $p$-adic etale cohomology_ ([pdf](http://www.ams.org/publications/online-books/conm67-conm67-ch4.pdf))

Further developments are in

* Amnon Besser, _Syntomic regulators and $p$-adic integration I: rigid syntomic regulators_ ([pdf](http://www.math.uiuc.edu/K-theory/0298/reg.pdf))

The following shows that, just as [[Deligne-Beilinson cohomology]] may be interpreted as [[absolute Hodge cohomology]], syntomic cohomology may be interpreted as $p$-adic absolute Hodge cohomology.
