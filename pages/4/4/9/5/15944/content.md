## Idea

Arithmetic cryptography is the developing subject that describes [[public key cryptography]] systems based on the use of arithmetic geometry of schemes (or [[global analytic spaces]]) over $\mathbb{Z}$.

There are two well known examples of such systems:

1. The first and most used one, which is very efficient **because** it is conformal to the [[KISS principle]], is based on the fact that it is very difficult (from the computational viewpoint) to factorize a natural number into a product of two big prime numbers.

1. The second one is based on the [[discrete logarithm problem]] on elliptic curves (or more generally abelian varieties) over finite fields. It has the advantage on the first algorithm of allowing to make shorted key, without compromising security (NSA has generalized the use of such algorithm both for commercial and classified use, as explained on the wikipedia page on elliptic curve cryptography).

The basic idea of arithmetic cryptography is to use a finite family $X$ of polynomials with integer coefficients $P_1,\dots,P_m\in \mathbb{Z}[X_1,\dots,X_n]$ (or more generally a quasi-projective scheme $X$ of finite type over $\mathbb{Z}$, or even maybe a [[global analytic space]] $X$ over a convenient Banach ring), encoded in a finite number of integers (the coefficients and degrees of the corresponding polynomials), together with some additional data (such as a way to cut a part of the associated motive) to define a [[public key]] cryptosystem.

Some computational aspects of general motives have been investigated in the case of motives of modular forms by Bass Edixhoven and Jean-Marc Couveignes.

## Methods

Since the space $X$ to be used is given by a non-linear equation, it is not directly adapted to the use of computational methods. One will thus need to extract linear invariants from $X$, by the use of a kind of  `differential calculus` (in Quillen's sense, i.e., using a convenient [[tangent (infinity,1)-category]]) and/or the definition of convenient `cohomological invariants`.

It seems that &#233;tale cohomological methods, that were originally used by Grothendieck and Deligne (and more recently, Laumon) to prove the full Weil conjectures, are not so easy to implement on a computer. It is quite clear that "[[Dwork]] type methods", based on p-adic differential calculus and Fourier transform, and now completely developed by Berthelot, Lestum, Caro and Kedlaya (p-adic proof of the Weil-conjectures) are better adapted to computations.

It thus looks like an important project to develop "[[Dwork]] type methods" in [[global analytic geometry]], starting with the definition of two types of cohomology theories for [[global analytic spaces]]: an [[absolute cohomology]] theory (related to the Chern character from K-theory to negative cyclic cohomology) and a [[geometric cohomology]] theory (with characteristic $0$ coefficients, e.g., in the full ring $\mathbb{A}$) of ad&#232;les. It may also be interesting to develop a notion of [[global Fourier transform]].

One of these cohomology theories (the absolute one) should give a natural way to study various conjectures on [[special values of L-functions]] and the other (the geometric one) should give a natural way to study the position of zeroes and poles of L-functions by spectral methods.

The [[geometric cohomology theory]] should also be (since it has characteristic $0$ coefficients) related to the theory of motives and [[global automorphic representations]], and thus give more generally a spectral way of studying zeroes and poles of the L-function of the rational motive of an [[arithmetic variety]].

## Aims

The aim of arithmetic cryptography is to define a good [[geometric cohomology]] theory for [[global analytic spaces]] based on analytic methods and differential calculus that would allow the definition of [[public key cryptography]] systems based on the datum of a [[global analytic space]] $X$ and of (say) a part $M$ of the associated (maybe absolute) rational motive $M(X)$. These kinds of methods would not be adapted to the attack of the previous ones, but may give a bigger class of public keys, that may allow the use of shorter ones. However, it is not yet clear that such a general approach will be conformal to the [[KISS principle]].

The constraints on such a theory would be the following:

1. find back the discrete logarithm elliptic public key cryptography when one starts from an elliptic curve over a finite field (or maybe a corresponding weak formal scheme over the ring of p-typical Witt vectors).

1. find back the original prime factorization public key cryptography when one starts from $\mathbb{Z}$. It must be clearly stressed here that such a general theory may be very hard to develop, since it should involve the definition of a proper cohomology for the Riemann zeta function, that would allow a spectral proof of its functional equation (as in Tate's thesis) `and` of the [[Riemann hypothesis]]. The full project thus looks like a very far reaching one, since there is, up to now, no precise idea of a way of constructing such a [[geometric cohomology]] theory (even if ideas on the constraints that it should fulfill are widespread in the mathematical litterature, e.g., in Deninger's work, in the [[field with one element]] litterature, in [[Langlands program]] and in the study of [[Weil-Ã©tale cohomology]]).
