[[Grothendieck]] has sketched a new formalism for homotopy theory in his manuscript Pursuing stacks and later left another manuscript on the main piece of that theory, the derivators. Independently there is a version due Heller

A __prederivator__ is a strict 2-functor $\mathbb{D}:Dia^{op,co}\to Cat$ where $Dia$ is a full 2-subcategory of $Cat$ (often $Cat$ itself). Morphisms of prederivators are pseudonatural 2-transformations of prederivators. 

A derivator is a prederivator satisfying a longer list of axioms. Every localizer induces a derivator. 

See the Sevilla lectures by Maltsionitis on model categories and derivators:

[Lecture I (Localizers)](http://people.math.jussieu.fr/~maltsin/Seville/Lecture_I_Localizers.pdf)

[Lecture II (Model Categories)](http://people.math.jussieu.fr/~maltsin/Seville/Lecture_II_Model_Categories.pdf)

There is also a notion of a triangulated derivator. Being triangulated, is unlike for categories, a property and not a structure; the same for morphisms.

This includes copies of the first thirteen chapters of a 2000 page manuscript of Grothendieck. 

[[Georges Maltsiniotis]] has written an introduction to the topic (in French) which is listed near the bottom of his homepage: (G. Maltsiniotis , "Introduction &#224; la th&#233;orie des d&#233;rivateurs, d'apr&#232;s Grothendieck", Preprint (2001).)
