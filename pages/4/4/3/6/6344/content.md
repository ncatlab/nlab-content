## Idea

In [[physics]], by a *fundamental* or *elementary* particle one means a *[[particle]]* which is not a [[bound state]] of other objects, hence which is "indivisible".

In computational practice this means that elementary particles are those that are *really* point-like, while non-elementary particles have a finite extension (if only in some averaged sense).

In the [[standard model of particle physics]] elementary particles include among the [[fermions]] the [[electrons]] and [[quarks]], and among the [[bosons]] the [[photon]] and the [[Higgs boson]]. In contrast, all [[hadrons]], hence all [[baryons]], hence in particular the [[proton]] and [[neutron]], are [[bound states]] of quarks, and then all [[nuclei]] are bound states of protons and [[neutrons]], and all [[atoms]] are bound states of nuclei and [[electrons]].

But of course, "[[atoms]]" get their name from a time when *they* were thought to be indivisible elementary particles, which highlights that the notion of what counts as "elementary" can change over time. 

Various "beyond standard" [[model (in theoretical physics)|models]] postulate that at least some of the currently understood elementary particles are in fact not so. For instance in "composite Higgs models" such as in *[[technicolor]]* models, the [[Higgs boson]] (which appears to be an elementary particle according to available measurements) is postulated to be a [[bound state]] and hence non-elementary.

In a slightly different manner, in usual [[string theory]] [[phenomenology]] *none* of the currently observed elementary particles would in fact be elementary, but all of them would arise as massless "states of [[strings]]".
