#Definition#

An __extensive category__ is a category $E$ with finite coproducts such that one, hence all, of the following equivalent conditions holds:

 1. Finite coproducts are disjoint and stable under pullback.
 1. For any objects $a,b$ the coproduct functor $E/a \times E/b \to E/(a+b)$ is an equivalence of categories.
 1. a certain pair of squares is a pullback if and only if it is a coproduct (see the paper referenced below).

Extensive categories are also called __positive categories__, especially if they are also [[coherent category|coherent]].

If an extensive category also has finite limits, it is called __lextensive__ or __finitary disjunctive__.

#Arity#

The definition refers only to binary coproducts, but it obviously implies analogous statements for $n$-ary coproducts for all $n\ge 1$.  Less obviously, it also implies the analogous statement for 0-ary coproducts (that is, initial objects).  In this case, the statement is that the initial object 0 is _strict_, meaning that any map $a\to 0$ is an isomorphism.

In the other direction, if $E$ has all small coproducts and the analogous infinitary condition holds, $E$ is called __$\infty$-extensive__, __$\infty$-positive__.  (Note that this use of $\infty$ is completely unrelated to $\infty$-[[infinity-category|categories]].)  If it has finite limits as well, it is __$\infty$-lextensive__ or __disjunctive__.

Can we say 'small-extensive'? Or even redefine 'extensive' to have this meaning, using 'finitely extensive' for the first version? &#8212;Toby

I think "extensive" is pretty well established for the finite version, and I would be reluctant to try to change it.  I wouldn't object too much to "small-extensive" for the infinitary version in principle, but $\infty$-positive is used in the Elephant and possibly elsewhere.  I think the topos theorists think by analogy with $\infty$-pretopos, which I don't think we have much hope of changing, despite the unfortunate clash with "$\infty$-topos."  But you can use "finitary disjunctive" and "disjunctive" in the lex case, which most examples are. -Mike

#Examples#

1. A [[topos]] is an (l)extensive category.

1. The category of topological spaces is (l)extensive. 

1. The category of affine schemes (opposite to the category of commutative rings with identity) is (l)extensive. 

1. The category Cat is (l)extensive.


#Extensive sites#

Any extensive category admits a [[Grothendieck topology]] whose [[cover|covering families]] are (generated by) the families of inclusions into a finite coproduct.  Likewise for an $\infty$-extensive category omitting the word "finite."

Moreover, given any Grothendieck topology on an extensive category whose covering families are generated by finite families and such that all families of inclusions into a finite coproduct are covering families, one can replace any (finite) covering family $(j_i: U_i \to B)_i$ with the single map $[j_i]_i: \coprod_i U_i \to B$.  The given Grothendieck topology is then generated by these single maps together with the families of finite coproduct inclusions.  An analogous fact is true for an $\infty$-extensive site whose covering families are generated by small ones.

I don't believe this, for reasons having nothing to do with the unlikelihood that a non-posetal small site would have all small coproducts (-: .  For example, any extensive category has an _extensive coverage_ in which the covering families are the families of coprojections into a finite coproduct.  But the only singleton covers are isomorphisms, which certainly do not form a basis. -Mike

Do you believe it now? &#8212;Toby

_Now_ I believe it.  (An extensive category with the trivial coverage would have been a counterexample to your second version.) -Mike
