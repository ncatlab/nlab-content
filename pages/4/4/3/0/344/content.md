# Extensive categories

## Idea

A [[category]] is _extensive_ if it has [[coproducts]] that interact well with [[pullbacks]].  Variations (some only terminological) include _lextensive_, _disjunctive_, and _positive_ categories.  All of these come in _finitary_ and _infinitary_ versions (and, more generally, $\kappa$-ary versions for any (regular) cardinal $\kappa$).


## Definitions

An __finitely extensive category__ (or __finitary extensive category__) is a category $E$ with finite [[coproduct|coproducts]] such that one, and hence all, of the following equivalent conditions holds:

 1. Finite coproducts are [[disjoint coproduct|disjoint]] and [[pullback stability|stable under pullback]].
 2. For any objects $a,b$ the coproduct functor $E/a \times E/b \to E/(a+b)$ is an [[equivalence of categories]].
 3. In any commutative diagram
 $$\array{x & \to & z & \leftarrow & y\\
   \downarrow  & &   \downarrow  &  &  \downarrow \\
   a & \to & a+b & \leftarrow & b}$$
 the two squares are pullbacks if and only if the top row is a coproduct diagram.

An __infinitary extensive category__ is a category $E$ with all (small) [[coproduct]]s such that coproducts are disjoint and stable under pullback.  In between, a __$\kappa$-ary extensive category__ (for $\kappa$ a [[cardinal number]]) is one with disjoint and stable coproducts of fewer than $\kappa$ objects.  The unqualified term **extensive category** can refer to either the finitary or infinitary version, depending on the author; the more usual meaning is the finitary version.

Extensive categories are also called __positive categories__, especially if they are also [[coherent category|coherent]].  Note that any disjoint coproduct in a coherent category is automatically pullback-stable.  A positive coherent category which is also [[exact category|exact]] is called a [[pretopos]].  Infinitary pretoposes encapsulate all the exactness conditions of Giraud's theorem characterizing [[Grothendieck topos|Grothendieck toposes]] (the remaining condition is the existence of a small [[generating set]]).

If an extensive category also has [[finitely complete category|finite limits]], it is called __lextensive__ or __disjunctive__.  (Note that the more usual default meaning of 'disjunctive', unlike the other terms, is the infinitary case.)


## Remarks

* The alternative definitions of finitary disjunctive refer only to binary coproducts, but they obviously imply analogous statements for $n$-ary coproducts for all finite $n \ge 1$.  Less obviously, they also imply the analogous statement for $0$-ary coproducts (that is, [[initial object]]s).  In this case, the statement is that the initial object 0 is _strict_ (any map $a\to 0$ is an isomorphism).

* See [[familial regularity and exactness]] for a generalization of extensivity and its relationship to [[exact category|exactness]].

* Any extensive category with finite [[products]] is automatically a [[distributive category]].


## Examples

1. A [[topos]] is finitary lextensive; a [[Grothendieck topos]] is infinitary lextensive.

2. The category [[Top]] of [[topological spaces]] is infinitary lextensive.  The category [[Diff]] of smooth [[manifolds]] is infinitary extensive, though it lacks all pullbacks.

3. The category of affine schemes (opposite to the category of commutative [[ring]]s with identity) is infinitary lextensive.

4. The category [[Cat]] is infinitary lextensive.


## Superextensive sites

Any extensive category admits a [[Grothendieck topology]] whose [[cover|covering families]] are (generated by) the families of inclusions into a [[coproduct]] (finite or small, as appropriate).  We call this the **extensive [[coverage]]** or **extensive topology**.  The [[codomain fibration]] of any extensive category is a [[stack]] for its extensive topology.

In general, we call a [[site]] __superextensive__ if its underlying category is extensive, its covering families are generated by (finite or small) families, and its coverage includes the extensive one.  See [[superextensive site]] for more details.


## Pre-lextensive categories

Extensivity is an "exactness" condition, analogous to being a [[exact category]] or a [[pretopos]] (a pretopos being precisely a category that is exact and finitary-extensive).  The corresponding "regularity" condition analogous to being a [[regular category]] or a [[coherent category]] is not well-known, but is not hard to write down.

Let us say (without making any assertion that this is good or permanent terminology) that a category is **pre-lextensive** if 

1. it has a [[strict initial object]] $0$ (equivalently, its [[subobject]] [[preorders]] have pullback-stable bottom elements), and
1. whenever $A\rightarrowtail X$ and $B\rightarrowtail X$ are disjoint subobjects (i.e. $A\cap B=0$), they have a pullback-stable union (which is then automatically a disjoint and stable coproduct).

This is intended to complete the table of analogies:

|some                   |all                |
|-----------------------|-------------------|
|regular category       |exact category     |
|coherent category      |pretopos           |
|pre-lextensive category|lextensive category|

Regular/exact categories have quotients of (some) [[congruences]].  Exact categories have quotients of all congruences, while regular ones have quotients only of congruences that are [[kernel pairs]].  Another way to say that is that in a regular category, you can conclude that the quotient of some congruence exists if you can exhibit another object of which the quotient would be a [[subobject]] if it existed.  Similarly, pre-/lextensive categories have [[disjoint unions]].  Lextensive categories have all disjoint unions (= [[coproducts]]), while in a pre-lextensive category you can conclude that a pair of objects $X,Y$ have a disjoint union if you can exhibit another object in which $X$ and $Y$ can be embedded disjointly.  Finally, coherent categories/pretoposes have both quotients and
disjoint unions, or equivalently quotients and not-necessarily-disjoint unions, with the same sort of relationship between the two.

Evidently a pre-lextensive category is lextensive as soon as any two objects can be embedded disjointly in a third.  Pre-lextensive categories also suffice for the interpretation of [[internal logic|disjunctive logic]].

Being pre-lextensive is also sufficient to define the extensive topology and show that it is subcanonical, since it implies that whatever disjoint coproducts exist must be pullback-stable.  The codomain fibration of a pre-lextensive category is not necessarily a stack for its extensive topology, but this condition is weaker than extensivity.  It is true, however, that if $C$ is a pre-lextensive category whose codomain fibration is a stack for its extensive topology, and in which the disjoint coproduct $1+1$ exists, then $C$ is extensive, for arbitrary disjoint (binary) coproducts can then be obtained by descent along the covering family $(1\to 1+1, 1\to 1+1)$.

## Discussions

While creating this page, we had the following discussion regarding "finitely" versus "infinitary."

+--{.query}
Can we say 'small-extensive'? Or even redefine 'extensive' to have this meaning, using 'finitely extensive' for the first version? &#8212;Toby

I think "extensive" is pretty well established for the finite version, and I would be reluctant to try to change it.  I wouldn't object too much to "small-extensive" for the infinitary version in principle, but $\infty$-positive is used in the Elephant and possibly elsewhere.  I think the topos theorists think by analogy with $\infty$-pretopos, which I don't think we have much hope of changing, despite the unfortunate clash with "$\infty$-topos."  But you can use "finitary disjunctive" and "disjunctive" in the lex case, which most examples are. -Mike

_Mike_: Okay, I just ran across one paper that uses "(infinitary) extensive" for the infinitary version the first time it was introduced, and then dropped the parenthetical for the rest of the paper.  I also recall seeing "extensive fibration" used for a fibration having disjoint and stable indexed coproducts, which is certainly a (potentially) infinitary notion.  So perhaps there is no real consensus on whether "extensive" definitely implies the finite version or the infinitary one.

_Toby_: It would be nice to not overload the prefix '$\infty$-' so much. It\'s like 'continuous'; default to small.

_Mike_: I agree that it would be nice to avoid $\infty$-.  What if we do what we did for [[omega-category]]?  That is, if you want to be unambiguous, say either "finitary extensive" or "infinitary extensive," and in any particular context you are allowed to define "extensive" at the beginning to be one of the two and use it without prefix in what follows.

_Toby_: Sure. Of course, the general concept is $\kappa$-extensive, where $\kappa$ is any cardinal (which we may assume to be regular).
