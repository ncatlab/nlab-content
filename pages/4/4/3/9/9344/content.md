## Idea

A _homotopy quotient_ is a [[quotient]] (say of a [[group]] [[action]]) in the context of _[[homotopy theory]]_. 


Just as a [[quotient]] is a special case of [[colimit]], so a homotopy quotient is a special case of [[homotopy colimit]]. 


The homotopy quotient of a [[group]] [[action]] may be modeled by the corresponding  _[[action groupoid]]_, which in the context of [[higher geometry]] means the corresponding  _[[quotient stack]]_.
