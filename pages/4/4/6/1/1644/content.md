## Usual notion

The __core__ $core(C)$ of a [[category]] $C$ is its maximal [[subcategory|sub]]-[[groupoid]]: the [[subcategory]] consisting of all objects but with [[morphism]]s only the [[isomorphism]]s.

We usually think of a groupoid as a special kind of category, but we can also think of a category as a groupoid equipped with additional morphisms.  (This is possible because [[Grpd]] is a [[reflective subcategory]] of [[Cat]].)  One level decategorified, we usually think in the opposite way: a [[poset]] is a [[set]] equipped with a [[partial order]], but we can also think of a set as a special kind of poset (specifically, a [[symmetric relation|symmetric]] one).


## Variations and generalizations

### $\dagger$-Categories

The __core__ of a [[dagger category]] consists of its unitary isomorphisms only.  This is why, for example, it makes sense to think of [[Hilb]] either as a category whose morphisms are linear maps bounded by $1$ or as a dagger category whose morphisms are all linear maps; either way, the core is the same (invertible linear maps of norm exactly $1$).


### Higher categories

The __core__ of an $n$-[[n-category|category]] is the $n$-[[n-groupoid|groupoid]] consisting only of [[equivalence]]s at each level; the __core__ of an $\infty$-[[infinity-category|category]] is similarly an $\infty$-[[infinity-groupoid|groupoid]]: the core of a [[quasicategory]] is the maximal [[Kan complex]] inside it.
