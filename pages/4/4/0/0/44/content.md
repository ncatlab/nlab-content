The **odd line** is the [[supermanifold]] $\mathbb{R}^{0|1}$ characterized by the fact that its $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded algebra of functions is the algebra free on a single odd generator $\theta$: $C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^{0|1}) = \mathbb{R}[\theta] = \mathbb{R} \oplus \theta\cdot \mathbb{R}$.

This algebra is essentially the [[ring of dual numbers]], but with the single generator in odd degree.
