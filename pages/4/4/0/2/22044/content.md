## Idea

In [[knot theory]], the known problem of [[unwinding knots|unwinding]] [[knots]] gives rise to the factorization of knots generated by composing [[prime knots]] and their __mutants__. The computational process of computing [[knot invariants]], namely the polynomials describing these [[invariants]], has been postulated as a basis for "attacks" in [[quantum cryptography]]. Classes of knots called _mutants_ would hinder these attacks and remain undetected by a [[quantum computer]], at their present maturity.  The _mutants_ of a given [[knot]] are indistinguishable since they all have the same Jones' type [[invariants]]. _Mutants_ also appear in the field-theoretic framework manifest in the expectation values of [[Wilson loop operators]].   

## Definition

Beginning with the [[tangle]] representation of an [[oriented knot]] $K$, one can obtain a __mutant__ $K'$ by replacing one of the [[tangle]]s with a rotated version of the former tangle. It is important to note that the process of mutation can be executed on various subsets of the same [[knot diagram]] containing at least one [[crossing]].
