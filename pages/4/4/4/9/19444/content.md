## Idea
_Feynman categories_  ([Kaufmann-Ward 13](#KaufmannWard13)) are monoidal categories with extra structures and properties that provide categorical way to corepresent operad-like objects.

They are a [[biequivalence|biequivalent]] approach to [[coloured operads]] and patterns ([Kaufmann-Ward 13](#KaufmannWard13),[Caviglia 15](#Caviglia15), [Batanin-Kock-Weber 15](#BataninKockWeber15)).

## Definition

Let $C$ be a [[groupoid]], $C^\otimes$ the [[free construction|free]] [[symmetric monoidal category]] on $C$ and $M$ a [[symmetric monoidal category]].

([Kaufman-Ward 2013, Defn 2.1](#KaufmanWard13)) A symmetric [[strong monoidal functor]] $\tau: C^\otimes\to M$ is a __Feynman category__ if the following are satisfied

* _isomorphisms condition_: $\tau^\otimes$ induces an equivalence of symmetric monoidal categories $C^\otimes \cong M_{iso}$

* _hereditary condition_: $\tau$ and $\tau^\otimes$ induce an equivalence of symmetric monoidal categories  $(C\downarrow M)^\otimes_{iso}\cong(M\downarrow M)_{iso}$

* _size condition_: For any $\ast \in C$, $(M \downarrow \ast)$ is [[essentially small]].

(Getzler 2009) A symmetric strong monoidal functor $\tau: C^\otimes\to M$ is a __regular pattern__ if the following are satisfied

* $\tau$ is [[essentially surjective functor|essentially surjective]]
* the induced functor of presheaves $\tau^{\hat{}} : M^{\hat{}}\to (C^\otimes)^{\hat{}}$ is strong monoidal for the [[Day convolution]] product

The latter condition on [[comma categories]] ensures the existence of certain (pointed) [[Kan extension]]s. 

The condition of a pattern or that of being hereditary guarantees that there is a left adjoint free functor for the forgetful functor of restricting a monoidal functor from $M$ to $C$.
This leads to a monadacity theorem for strong monoidal functors from $M$ to some cocomplete $D$, namely that they are equivalent to algebras over the monad of the adjunction.

Furthermore any morphisms $f$ in the 2-category of Feynman categories defines a pull--back $f^*$ on strong monoidal functors and a left adjoint push-forward  $f_!$ computed by a left Kan extension. The theorem is that the Kan extension is strong monoidal.

## Properties

### Equivalence with coloured operads
 {#EquivalenceWithColouredOperads}
The relationship to patterns and groupoid colored operads
is given in [Kaufmann-Ward 13](#KaufmannWard13) and was further upgraded to an [[equivalence of 2-categories]] between the [[2-category]] of Feynman categories and that of [[coloured operads]] ([Caviglia 15](#Caviglia15), [Batanin-Kock-Weber 15](#BataninKockWeber15)).
This allows to import results from Feynman categories such as W-constructions to the other theories.

> We consider three a priori totally different setups for Hopf algebras from number theory, mathematical physics and algebraic topology. These are the Hopf algebras of Goncharov for multiple zeta values, that of Connes--Kreimer for renormalization, and a Hopf algebra constructed by Baues to study double loop spaces. We show that these examples can be successively unified by considering simplicial objects, cooperads with multiplication and Feynman categories at the ultimate level. These considerations open the door to new constructions and reinterpretation of known constructions in a large common framework.
