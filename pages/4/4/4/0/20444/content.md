## Idea

The _Archive of Formal Proofs_ (*AFP*) is an online library of [[formal proofs]], examples, and projects formalized in the [[proof assistant]] [[Isabelle]].

In contrast to other current projects, AFP and Isabelle are based on classical [[set theory|set theoretic]] [[foundation of mathematics|foundations]].
It already comprises a large amount of concepts like [smooth manifolds](https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Smooth_Manifolds.html), [Markov models](https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Markov_Models.html), [Monoidal Categories](https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/MonoidalCategory.html), or [ordinals and cardinals](https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Ordinals_and_Cardinals.html) to mention a few.
