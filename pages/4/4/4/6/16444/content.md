## Idea

The embedding of a non-compact [[Lorentzian manifold]] into a [[compact]] Lorentzian manifold as a dense open subspace, such that the embedding is a [[conformal]] map.

## Example

The conformal compactification $\overline{M}$ of (flat) [[Minkowski space]] $M = \mathbb{R}^{n,1}$ is important in various treatments of behaviour at infinity of physics thereon.

The blog post ([Wong 2009](#Wong09))) claims that the underlying manifold of $\overline{M}$ is $S^n\times S^1$, but then clarifies that this is a 'double cover', but in a non-specific way. Section 4.2 of ([Nikolov-Todorov](#NikolovTodorov)) gives a thorough geometric discussion of the construction and gives explicit expressions in coordinates, and shows that (the underlying manifold of) $\overline{M}$ is in fact $(S^n\times S^1)/\{\pm 1\}$, for a specific embedding of $S^n\times S^1$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1,2}$, and the action by scalar multiplication.
