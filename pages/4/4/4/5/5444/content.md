######Definition 

An **(finitary) essentially algebraic $(\infty,1)$-theory** is an [[(∞,1)-category]] $T$ with (finite) [[(∞,1)-limit]]s.

An **algebra** over an essentially algebraic $(\infty,1)$-theory in some [[(∞,1)-topos]] $\mathcal{X}$ is a (finite) $(\infty,1)$-limit preserving [[(∞,1)-functor]]
