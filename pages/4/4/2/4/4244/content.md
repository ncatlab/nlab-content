## Idea

An $n$-dimensional Calabi-Yau variety is an $n$-dimensional [[Kähler manifold]] with (holomorphically, rather than topologically) trivial [[canonical bundle]]. This is equivalent to having $SU(N)$-[[holonomy]]. 

For compact Kaehler manifolds, Yau's theorem (also known as the Calabi conjecture) implies that the above conditions are also equivalent to the vanishing of the first [[Chern class]].

Is it also true for non-compact?

Note that $c_1(X) = 0$ implies in general that the canonical bundle is *topologically trivial*. But if $X$ is a compact Kaehler manifold, $c_1(X) = 0$ implies further that the canonical bundle is *holomorphically trivial*.

+--{.query}
The language used in this article is implicitly analytic, rather than algebraic. Is this OK? Or should I make this explicit?
