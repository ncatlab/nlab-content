## Idea

An $n$-dimensional _Calabi-Yau variety_ is an $n$-dimensional [[Kähler manifold]] with ([[holomorphic line bundle|holomorphically]], rather than just topologically) trivial [[canonical bundle]]. This is equivalent to saying that it is real [[Riemannian manifold]] of even [[dimension]] $2 N$ which has [[special holonomy]] in the [[subgroup]] $SU(N)\subset O(2 N, \mathbb{R})$. 

For [[compact topological space|compact]] [[Kähler manifolds]], [[Yau's theorem]] (also known as the  [[Calabi conjecture]]) states any of the above conditions implies the vanishing of the first [[Chern class]].

+--{.query}
Is it also true for non-compact?
=--

Note that $c_1(X) = 0$ implies in general that the canonical bundle is *topologically trivial*. But if $X$ is a simply connected compact K&#228;hler manifold, $c_1(X) = 0$ implies further that the canonical bundle is *holomorphically trivial*.

+--{.query}
The language used in this article is implicitly analytic, rather than algebraic. Is this OK? Or should I make this explicit?
=--

## Definition

A Calabi-Yau variety can be described algebraically as a [[smooth scheme|smooth]] [[proper scheme|proper]] [[variety]] $X$ of [[dimension]] $n$ over a [[field]] $k$ (not necessarily [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]] and not necessarily of [[characteristic]] $0$) in which $\omega_X=\wedge^n\Omega^1\simeq \mathcal{O}_X$ and also $H^j(X, \mathcal{O}_X)=0$ for all $1\leq j \leq n-1$.

If the base field is $\mathbb{C}$, then one can form the analyticification of $X$ and obtain a [[compact space|compact]] [[manifold]] that satisfies the first given definition.

Beware that there are slightly different (and inequivalent) definitions in use. Notably in some contexts only the trivialization of the [[canonical bundle]] is required, but not the vanishing of the $H^{0 \lt \bullet \lt n}(X,\mathcal{O}_X)$. To be explicit on this one sometimes speaks for emphasis of "strict" CY varieties when including this condition.

## Examples

* in [[dimension]] 1: [[elliptic curve]]

* In [[dimension]] 2: [[K3 surface]].

## Properties

### In terms of $G$-structure

Calabi-Yau structure is equivalently [[integrability of G-structure|integrable]] [[G-structure]] for $G = $ [[SU(n)]].

Details are in [Prins 16, Prop. 1.3.2](#Prins16). 
See also [Vezzoni 06, p. 24](#Vezzoni06).

### In SU-bordism theory
 {#InSUBordismTheory}

We discuss the classes of Calabi-Yau manifolds seen in [[SU-bordism theory]]. For more see _[[Calabi-Yau manifolds in SU-bordism theory]]_.

###### Proposition
**([[K3-surface]] spans [[SU-bordism ring]] in degree 4)**

The degree-4 generator $y_4 \in \Omega^{SU}_4$ in the [[SU-bordism ring]] (Prop. \ref{SUBordismRingAwayFromTwo}) is represented by minus the class of any (non-[[torus]]) [[K3-surface]]:

$$
  \Omega^{SU}_4 \;\simeq\; \mathbb{Z}\big[ \tfrac{1}{2}\big]\big\langle -[K3] \big\rangle
  \,.

###### Proposition

###### Proposition
**([[Calabi-Yau manifolds]] in complex dim $\leq 4$ generate the [[SU-bordism ring]] in $deg \leq 8$ [[localization of a ring|away from 2]])**

There are [[Calabi-Yau manifolds]] of complex dimension $3$ and $4$ whose whose SU-bordism classes equal the generators $\pm y_6$ and $\pm y_8$ in Prop. \ref{SUBordismRingAwayFromTwo}.

### Artin-Mazur formal group

Over an [[algebraically closed field]] of [[positive number|positive]] [[characteristic]] an $n$-dimensional Calabi-Yau variety $X$ has an [[Artin-Mazur formal group]] $\Phi^n_X$ which gives the [[deformation theory]] of the trivial [[line n-bundle]] over $X$.
