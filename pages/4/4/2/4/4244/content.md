An $n$-dimensional Calabi-Yau variety is an $n$-dimensional [[KÃ¤hler manifold]] with trivial [[canonical bundle]]. This is equivalent to having $S U(N)$-[[holonomy]]. 

For compact Kaehler manifolds, the above conditions are also equivalent to $c_1 = 0$. (Is it also true for non-compact? I am not sure.)
