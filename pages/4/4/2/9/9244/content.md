## Idea

For all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ there is supposed to be a pair of [[adjoint (∞,1)-functors]] 

$$
  E_n Alg \stackrel{\overset{\mathcal{U}_n}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{}{\to}}
  L_\infty
$$

between [[E-n algebras]] and [[L-∞ algebras]], suitably factoring through [[Poisson n-algebras]].

The [[left adjoint]] $\mathcal{U}_n$ sends an [[L-∞ algebra]] to its _universal enveloping $E_n$-algebra_ in that for $n = 1$ and for $\mathfrak{g}$ an ordinary [[Lie algebra]], $\mathcal{U}_1(\mathfrak{g})$ is the [[associative algebra]] (an $E_1$=[[A-∞ algebra|A-∞]] algebra) which is the ordinary [[universal enveloping algebra]] of $\mathfrak{g}$.

## References

Aspects of this are mentioned in the context of [[factorization homology]] in section 5 and in particular around the bottom of p. 18 in

and more specifically in the context of [[factorization algebras of observables]] around remark 4.5.5 of 

* [[Owen Gwilliam]], _Factorization algebras and free field theories_ PhD thesis ([pdf](http://math.berkeley.edu/~gwilliam/thesis.pdf))
 {#Gwilliam}

The fact that $\mathcal{U}_1$ reproduces the traditional [[universal enveloping algebra]] of a Lie algebra is prop. 4.6.1 in ([Gwilliam](#Gwilliam)).
