Oka manifolds comprise a special class of complex analytic manifolds which are suited to apply the [[Oka principle]]. Oka maps are a relative version; they are fibrations in the Jardine-L&#225;russon model structure on the category of [[simplicial presheaves]] on the simplicial Stein site. Those cofibrant objects which are representable by complex manifolds are in fact [[Stein manifold]]s.
