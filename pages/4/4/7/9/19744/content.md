## Idea

In [[number theory]], the _Goldbach conjecture_ is the following [[conjecture]].

\begin{conjecture} Every [[even number]] greater than 2 is the [[sum]] of two [[prime numbers]]. \end{conjecture}

## Properties

### Relation to Bertrand's postulate

It was observed in [Ricardo 05](#Ricardo05) that the Goldbach conjecture implies a simple proof of [[Bertrand's postulate]] (which has been proven, independently of the Goldbach conjecture). See [there](Bertrand's+postulate#ProofFromGoldbach) for details.
