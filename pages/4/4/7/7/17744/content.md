A talk given on June 10, 1854 by [[Bernhard Riemann]] before the G&#246;ttingen Faculty that included Gauss, Dedekind, and Weber in the audience. Its original German title was _&#220;ber die Hypothesen, welche der geometrie zu Grunde liegen_. 

>Now it seems that the empirical notions on which the metric determinations
of Space are based, the concept of a solid body and a light ray, lose their validity
in the infinitely small; it is therefore quite definitely conceivable that the metric
relations of Space in the infinitely small do not conform to the hypotheses of
geometry; and in fact, one ought to assume this as soon as it permits a simpler
way of explaining phenomena...
