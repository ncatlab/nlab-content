## Idea

The term _brave new algebra_ has been coined to refer to the [[higher algebra]] of [[E-infinity rings]] ("brave new rings"), amplifying the step from more traditional [[algebra]].

Specifically, the term is typically used for the particular presentation of [[E-infinity rings]] by way of [[highly structured ring spectra]] such as [[commutative monoids]] of [[symmetric spectra]].

In consequence people also speak for instance of _brave new Hopf algebroids_ when referring to the [[Hopf algebroids]] of (dual) $E$-[[Steenrod algebras]] for some [[ring spectrum]] $E$. See at _[Steenrod algebra -- Hopf algebroid structure](#Steenrod+algebra)_.
