In every [[smooth topos]] $(\mathcal{T}, R)$ the notion of [[infinitesimal neighbour]] induces for every [[microlinear space]] $X \in \mathcal{T}$ the [[simplicial object]]


$$
  \Pi^{inf}(X) := X^{\Delta^{\bullet}_{inf}}
$$

(see the notation and discussion at [[infinitesimal neighbour]]).

Using the standard [[model structure on simplicial objects in a topos]] this presents an [[∞-groupoid]] internal to $\mathcal{T}$, the **infinitesimal path $\infty$-groupoid** of $X$.

There is also the finite [[path ∞-groupoid in a smooth topos]] $\Pi(X)$ for each $X$ and a canonical inclusion

$$
  \Pi^{inf}(X) \hookrightarrow  
  \Pi{X}
  \,.
