## Idea

The notion of an _elementary (∞,1)-topos_ is the analog of the notion of _[[elementary topos]]_ in [[(∞,1)-category theory]].

This is in contrast to the notion of an _[[(∞,1)-topos]] [[equivalence of (∞,1)-categories|equivalent]] to an [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves]]_, the analog of a [[sheaf topos]], which is more specific (see [[geometric homotopy type theory]]). 

While every [[(∞,1)-sheaf]] [[(∞,1)-topos]] provides [[categorical semantics]] for [[homotopy type theory]] with a [[univalence|univalent]] Tarskian-[[type of types]] (and [[higher inductive types]]), one idea is roughly that elementary $(\infty,1)$-topos should be defined as the larger class which is exactly the [[categorical semantics]] for homotopy type theory in this sense. For more on this see at

## References


A proposal for a definition, with an eye towards [[homotopy type theory]] and the [[relation between type theory and category theory]] is on the very last slide of 

* {#Shulman12} [[Mike Shulman]], _Inductive and higher inductive types_ (2012) ([pdf](http://www.math.ias.edu/~mshulman/hottminicourse2012/04induction.pdf))

This proposal is [[predicative mathematics|predicative]], but could be made impredicative easily (to correspond closer to elementary 1-toposes rather than to types of 1-[[pretoposes]]) by adding a [[subobject classifier]] (i.e. a classifier for *all* subobjects, rather than merely the "classifiers for small subobjects" obtainable from object classifiers).
