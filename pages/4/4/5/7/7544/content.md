## Idea

The notion of an _elementary (∞,1)-topos_ is the analog of the notion of _[[elementary topos]]_ in [[(∞,1)-category theory]].

This is in contrast to the notion of an _[[(∞,1)-topos]] [[equivalence of (∞,1)-categories|equvialent]] to an [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves]]_, the analog of a [[sheaf topos]], which is more specific. 

## References

A proposal for a definition, with an eye towards [[homotopy type theory]] and the [[relation between type theory and category theory]] is on the very last slide of

This proposal is [[predicative mathematics|predicative]], but could be made impredicative easily (to correspond closer to elementary 1-toposes rather than to types of 1-[[pretoposes]]) by adding a [[subobject classifier]] (i.e. a classifier for *all* subobjects, rather than merely the "classifiers for small subobjects" obtainable from object classifiers).
