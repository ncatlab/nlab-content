#Idea#

The _join of two [[quasi-category|quasi-categories]]_ is the generalization of the [[join of categories]] from ordinary [[category|categories]] to [[quasi-category|quasi-categories]].

The  _join_ of quasi-categories $C$ and $C'$ is a [[quasi-category]] $C \star C'$ which looks roughly like the disjoint union of $C$ with $C'$ with one morphisms from every object of $C$ to every object of $C'$ thrown in.


#Definition#

The **join** $C \star C'$ of two [[quasi-category|quasi-categories]] $C$ and $C'$ is their [[join of simplicial sets]].

Indeed, the join of two [[simplicial set]]s that happen to be [[quasi-category|quasi-categories]] is itself a quasi-category, due to
