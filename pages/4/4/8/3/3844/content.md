## Idea

In as far as an [[algebraic theory]] or [[Lawvere theory]] is nothing but a [[small category]] with finite [[product]]s and an [[algebra]] for the theory a product-preserving [[functor]] to [[Set]], the notion has an evident generalization to [[higher category theory]] and in particular to [[(∞,1)-category]] theory.

## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

An **$(\infty,1)$-Lawvere theory** is (given by a syntactic $(\infty,1)$-category that is) an [[(∞,1)-category]] $C$ with finite [[limit in a quasi-category|(∞,1)-product]]s. An $(\infty,1)$-algebra for the theory is an [[(∞,1)-functor]] $C \to $ [[∞Grpd]] that preserves these products.

The $(\infty,1)$-category of [[∞-algebras over an (∞,1)-algebraic theory]] is the full [[sub-(∞,1)-category]]

$$
  Alg_{(\infty,1)}(C) \hookrightarrow PSh_{(\infty,1)}(C^{op})
$$

of the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-presheaves]] on $C^{op}$ on the product-preserving $(\infty,1)$-functors

=--

In a full $(\infty,1)$-category theoretic context this appears as [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, def. 5.5.8.8]]. A definition in terms of [[simplicially enriched categories]] and the [[model structure on sSet-categories]] to present $(\infty,1)$-categories is in [Ros]((http://www.math.muni.cz/~rosicky/papers/infty6.pdf). The introduction of that article lists further and older occurences of this definition.


## Properties

+-- {: .num_prop #PropertiesOfInfinityCategoriesOfAlgebras}
###### Proposition

Let $C$ be an [[(∞,1)-category]] with finite [[limit in a quasi-category|products]]. Then 

* $Alg_{(\infty,1)}(C)$ is an [[accessible (∞,1)-functor|accessible]] [[localization of an (∞,1)-category|localization]] of the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-presheaves]] $PSh_{(\infty,1)}(C^{op})$ (on the [[opposite (∞,1)-category|opposite]]).

  So in particular it is a [[locally presentable (∞,1)-category]].

* $Alg_{(\inft)}$ is a [[compactly generated (∞,1)-category]].

* The $(\infty,1)$-[[Yoneda embedding]] $j : C^{op} \to PSh_{(\infty,1)}(C^{op})$ factors through $Alg_{(\infty,1)}(C)$.

* The full subcategory $Alg_{(\infty,1)}(C) \hookrightarrow PSh_{(\infty,1)}(C)$ is stable under [[sifted colimit]]s.


=--

This is [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, prop. 5.5.8.10]].

## Models {#Models}

There are various [[model category]] [[presentable (∞,1)-category|presentations]] of $Alg_{(\infty,1)}(C) \hookrightarrow PSh_{(\infty,1)}(C^{op})$.

Recall that the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-presheaves]] $PSh_{(\infty,1)}(C^{op})$ itself is modeled by the [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]]

$$
  PSh_{(\infty,1)}(C^{op})
  \simeq
  [T, sSet]^\circ
  \,,
$$

where we regard $T$ as a [[Kan complex]]-[[enriched category]] and have on the right the [[sSet]]-[[enriched functor category]] with the projective or injective model structure, and $(-)^\circ$ denoting the full enriched subcategory on fibrant-cofibrant objects.

This says in particular that every weak $(\infty,1)$-functor $f : T \to \infty \mathrm{Grp}$ is equivalent to a _rectified_ on $F : T \to KanCplx$. And $f \in PSh_{(\infty,1)}(C^{op})$ belongs to $Alg_{(\infty,1)}(C)$ if $F$ preserves finite products _weakly_  in that for $\{c_i \in C\}$ a finite collection of objects, the canonical natural morphism

$$
  F(c_1 \times \cdots\times \c_n)
  \to
  F(c_1) \times \cdots \times F(c_n)
$$ 

is a [[homotopy equivalence]] of [[Kan complex]]es.

If $T$ is an ordinary category with products, hence an ordinary [[Lawvere theory]], then such a functor is called a **[[homotopy T-algebra]]**. There is a model category structure on these (see there).

We now look at model category structure on _strictly_ product preserving functors $C \to sSet$, which gives an equivalent model for $Alg_{(\infty,1)}(C)$. See [[model structure on simplicial T-algebras]].

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Let $C$ be a [[category]] with finite [[product]]s, and let $sTAlg \subset Func(C,sSet)$ be the [[full subcategory]] of the [[functor category]] from $C$ to [[sSet]] on those functors that preserve these products.  

Then $sAlg(C)$ carries the structure of a [[model category]] $sAlg(C)_{proj}$ where the weak equivalences and the fibrations are objectwise those in the standard [[model structure on simplicial sets]]. 

=--

This is due to ([Quillen](#Quillen)).


The inclusion $i : sAlg(C) \hookrightarrow sPSh(C^{op})_{proj}$ into the projective [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] evidently preserves fibrations and acylclic fibrations and gives a [[Quillen adjunction]]

$$
  sAlg(C)_{proj}
  \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\underset{i}{\hookrightarrow}}
  sPSh(C^{op})
  \,.
$$


+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The total right [[derived functor]] 

$$
  \mathbb{R}i : Ho(sAlg(C)_{proj}) \to Ho(sPSh(C^{op})_{proj})
$$ 

is a [[full and faithful functor]] and an object $F \in sPSh(C^{op})$ belongs to the [[essential image]] of $\mathbb{R}i$ precisely if it preserves products up to [[weak homotopy equivalence]].

=--

This is due to ([Bergner](#Bergner)).

It follows that the natural $(\infty,1)$-functor

$$
  (sAlg(C)_{proj})^\circ \stackrel{}{\to}
  PSh_{(\infty,1)}(C^{op})
$$

is an [[equivalence of quasi-categories|equivalence]].

A comprehensive statement of these facts is in [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, section 5.5.9]].

## Examples

### Simplicial 1-algebras

For $T$ (the [[syntactic category]] of) an ordinary [[algebraic theory]] (a [[Lawvere theory]]) let $T Alg$ be the category of its ordinary algebras, the ordinary product-preserving functors $T \to Set$.

We may regard $T$ as an $(\infty,1)$-category and consider its $(\infty,1)$-algebras. By the above discussion, these are modeled by product-presering functors $T \to sSet$. But this are equivalently [[simplicial object]]s in $T$-algebras

$$
  [T, sSet]_\times \simeq T Alg^{\Delta^{op}}
  \,.
$$

There is a standard [[model structure on simplicial T-algebras]] and we find that simplicial $T$-1-algebras model $T$-$(\infty,1)$-algebras.


### Homotopy $T$-algebras

For $T$ an ordinary Lawvere theory, there is also a model category structure on ordinary functors $T \to sSet$ that preserve the products only up to weak equivalence. Such functors are called [[homotopy T-algebra]]s.

This model structure is equivalent to the [[model structure on simplicial T-algebras]] (see [[homotopy T-algebra]] for details) but has the advantage that it is a left [[proper model category]].

### Simplicial theories

There is a notion of _simplicial algebraic theory_ that captures some class of $(\infty,1)$-algebraic theories. For the moment see section 4 of ([Rezk](#Rezk))

### Structure-$(\infty,1)$-sheaves

A pre[[geometry (for structured (∞,1)-toposes)]] is a (multi-sorted) $(\infty,1)$-algebraic theory. A _structure $(\infty,1)$-sheaf_ on an [[(∞,1)-topos]] $\mathcal{X}$ in the sense of [[structured (∞,1)-topos]]es is an $\infty$-algebra over this theory 

$$
  \mathcal{O} : \mathcal{T} \to \mathcal{X}
$$

in the $(\infty,1)$-topos $\mathcal{X}$ -- a special one satisfying extra conditions that make it indeed behave like a sheaf of _function algebras_ .

### Symmetric monoidal $(\infty,1)$-Categories and $E_\infty$-algebras {#EInfty}

There is a $(2,1)$-algebraic theory whose algebras in 
[[(∞,1)Cat]] are [[symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-categories]].  Hence monoids in these algebras are [[E-∞ algebra]]s (see [[monoid in a monoidal (∞,1)-category]]).

This is in ([Cranch](#Cranch)). For more details see 
[[(2,1)-algebraic theory of E-infinity algebras]].
