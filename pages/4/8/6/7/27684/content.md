## Idea

The **principle of enough functions** states that the formal [[locale]] of the [[function space]] $\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{R}$ of [[continuous]] [[Dedekind real number|real]] [[endofunctions]] is a [[spatial locale]]. 

The principle of enough functions is true in [[classical mathematics]], but cannot be proven in [[neutral constructive mathematics]] and so has to be added as an axiom. 

## Related concepts

* [[fan theorem]] (The [[locale]] of [[Cantor space]] is a [[spatial locale]].)

* [[monotone bar induction]] (The [[locale]] of the [[Baire space of sequences]] is a [[spatial locale]].)
