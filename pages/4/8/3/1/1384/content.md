#Idea#

Recall the pattern in ordinary [[algebra]]:

* In a [[monoidal category]] one can consider [[monoid]] or [[algebra]] objects.

* In a [[symmetric monoidal category]] one can consider commutative [[monoid]] or [[algebra]] objects.

Accordingly in [[higher algebra]]:

* In a [[monoidal (infinity,1)-category]] one can consider [[algebra in an (infinity,1)-category]].

* In a [[symmetric monoidal (infinity,1)-category]] one can consider commutative algebra objects.

#Definition#

A **commutative algebra object** in a [[symmetric monoidal (infinity,1)-category]] $C$ is a lax symmetric monoidal $(\infty,1)$-functor

$$
  * \to C
  \,.
$$

In more detail, this means the following:

###### Definition

Given a [[symmetric monoidal (infinity,1)-category]] in its [[quasi-category|quasi-categorical]] incarnation as a coCartesian fibration of [[simplicial set]]s

$$
  p : C^\otimes \to N(FinSet_*)
$$

a **commutative algebra object** in $C$ is a [[section]]

$$
  A : N(FinSet_*) \to C^\otimes
$$

such that $A$ carries collapsing morphisms in $FinSet_*$ to coCartesian morphisms in $C^\otimes$.

#Examles#
