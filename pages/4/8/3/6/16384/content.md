## Statement

The only Euclidean [[composition algebras]] / [[division algebra|division]] [[composition algebras]] over the [[real numbers]] (i.e. real [[normed division algebras]]) are, up to [[isomorphism]], the algebras of

1. [[real numbers]]

2. [[complex numbers]]

3. [[quaternions]]

4. [[octonions]].

For more see at _[composition algebra -- Hurwitz theorem](composition+algebra#HurwitzTheoremSection)_.


## Implications

### Real spinor representations and supersymmetry

This classification turns out to closely connect to various other systems of exceptional structures in [[mathematics]] and [[physics]]. Notably patterns related to [[Majorana spinors]] in [[spin geometry]] are intimately related to the four normed division algebras, and, induced by this, so is the classification of [[super Poincaré Lie algebras]] and [[super Minkowski spacetimes]] (which are built from these real spin representations). For more on this see at _[[supersymmetry and division algebras]]_ and _[[geometry of physics -- supersymmetry]]_.

### Hopf invariant one maps

The classification matches that of [[Hopf invariant one]] maps. See there for more. 

See also at _[[cross product]]_.

## Generalized Hurwitz Theorem

As describe in [Elduque (2021)](#Elduque21), the Hurwitz Theorem can be extended to more general [[composition algebras]] that are not necessarily unital, but that are *para-unital* or even *non-unital* (see [here](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/composition+algebra#definition) for the relevant definitions). 

The Generalized Hurwitz Theorem then becomes the statement that the only Euclidean composition algebras over the real numbers are, up to isomorphism:

1. Seven unital algebras: real numbers, complex numbers, quaternions, and octonions (along with their [split](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/composition+algebra#split_composition_algebras) companions).

2. Seven para-unital algebras, corresponding to the para- counterparts of the unital algebras above.

3. Two eight-dimensional non-unital algebras: the [[Okubo algebra]] $\mathcal{O}$ and its split counterpart $\mathcal{O}_s$.
