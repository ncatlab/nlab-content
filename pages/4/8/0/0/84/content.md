Think you know everything under the sun? 

Then ponder the puzzle of [Light Mills](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/07/light_mills.html), and check out Greg Egan's magnificent [Light Mill Simulation Applet](http://www.gregegan.net/SCIENCE/LightMill/LightMill.html).

Someday this puzzle should become part of a series on 'Gnarly Problems in Physics'.  These are puzzles that aren't very technical at first, that get deeper and more complicated the more you think about them.  We should start a page on [[gnarly problems in physics]] and list more there.  John Baez has imagined writing a book on these someday.
