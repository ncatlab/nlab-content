## Idea

Group homology is the [[homology]] dual of [[group cohomology]].

See for instance at _[group cohomology -- In terms of homological algebra](group+cohomology#InTermsOfHomologicalAlgebra)_ and replace [[Ext]] by [[Tor]].

Accordingly, the group homology of a [[discrete group]] $G$ is equivalently the [[ordinary homology]] of its [[classifying space]] $B G$ (the [[Eilenberg-MacLane space]] $K(G,1)$):

$$
  H^{grp}_\bullet(G)
  \;\simeq\;
  H_\bullet\big( B G \big)
  \,.
$$
