#Idea#

A directed $n$-graph is a higher dimensional generalization of a [[directed graph]] with $r$-dimensional _edges_ spanning $(r-1)$-dimensional _vertices_.

#Definition#

A **directed $n$-graph** $G = \prod_{r=0}^n G_r$ is 

* a collection $G_r$ of $r$-dimensional _edges_;

* together with two maps $s,t : G_r \to G_{r-1}$, called
the _source_ and _target_ maps, where $G_{-1}$ is the empty set.

##Remarks##

* A directed $n$-graph is like an [[n-category]] with units and composition forgotten. Indeed, an [[n-category]] is a directed $n$-graph with extra structure.

* A directed 1-graph is a [[directed graph]].
