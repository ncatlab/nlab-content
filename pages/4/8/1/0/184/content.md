#Idea#



A directed $n$-graph is a higher dimensional generalization of a [[directed graph]] with $r$-dimensional _edges_ spanning $(r-1)$-dimensional _vertices_.

#Definition#

A **directed $n$-graph** $G = \prod_{r=0}^n G_r$ is 

* a collection $G_r$ of $r$-dimensional _edges_;

* together with, for each $r \geq 1 \in \mathbb{N}$, two maps $s,t : G_r \to G_{r-1}$, called
the _source_ and _target_ maps, where $G_{-1}$ is the empty set.

##Remarks##

* A directed 1-graph is a [[directed graph]].


* A directed $n$-graph is like an [[n-category]] with units and composition forgotten. Indeed, an [[n-category]] is a directed $n$-graph with extra structure.

_[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]] says_: I am still searching the literature: somewhere _$n$-graph_ has been defined before. Notice that if the _globularity condition_ on source and target maps are imposed, then an $\infty$-graph is a **[[globular set]]**. Indeed, $\omega$-[[omega-category|categories]] are [[globular set]]s with extra structure.

_[[Eric Forgy|Eric]] says: Here are some references that might be relevant:: [Fundamental groupoids of k-graphs](http://www.emis.de/journals/NYJM/j/2004/10-12.pdf), [$C^*$-algebras associated to higher-rank graphs](http://www.newcastle.edu.au/service/library/adt/uploads/approved/adt-NNCU20060327.122628/public/02whole.pdf). 

_[[Eric Forgy|Eric]] says: Bingo! I would love to have a copy of this paper: [The algebra of directed complexes](http://www.springerlink.com/content/r883k2v72j810311/)

**Abstract** The theory of directed complexes is a higher-dimensional generalisation of the theory of directed graphs. In a directed graph, the simple directed paths form a subset of the free category which they generate; if the graph has no directed cycles, then the simple directed paths constitute the entire category. Generalising this, in a directed complex there is a class of split subsets which is contained in and generates a free $\omega$-category; when a simple loop-freeness condition is satisfied, the split sets constitute the entire $\omega$-category. The class of directed complexes is closed under the natural product and join constructions. The free $\omega$-categories generated by directed complexes include the important examples associated to cubes and simplexes.

_[[Eric Forgy|Eric]] says: My brain hurts. This paper [Simple omega-categories and chain complexes](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0608680) says that a [[globular set]] is sometimes referred to as a $\omega$-graph. I am probably reinventing the wheel, but it is neat nonetheless.
