## Definition

A [[field]] $k$ is *formally real* if one of the following equivalent conditions is satisfied:

* $k$ is a [[formally real ring]].

* $-1$ is not a sum of squares in $k$ (a special case of the previous condition).

* There exists an [[linear order]] on $k$ which makes $k$ into an [[ordered field]].

* The [[Witt group]] of $k$ is not torsion.

Due to the last property, formally real fields play a special r&#244;le in the theory of [[Witt groups]] and in related fields of study such as [[motivic homotopy theory]].

A formally real field which is the only formally real [[algebraic extension]] of itself is a [[real closed field]]; such a field admits a unique ordering.


## Examples

* The field of [[real numbers]] is formally real, and even a [[real closed field]].

* The field $\mathbb{Q}$ of [[rational numbers]] is formally real but not real closed.

* [[finite field|Finite fields]] (or more generally fields of nonzero [[characteristic]]) and [[algebraically closed fields]] (such as the fields of [[complex numbers]] and [[algebraic numbers]]) are never formally real.
