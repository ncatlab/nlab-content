#Idea#

$n$-Dimensional [[manifolds]] (possibly and usually equipped with certain structure, notably for instance with orientation) should naturally form an [[(∞,n)-category]] of [[extended cobordisms]] whose

* [[objects]] are 0-dimensional (oriented) manifolds (disjoint unions of (oriented) points);

* 1-[[morphisms]] are (oriented) [[cobordisms]] between disjoint unions of (oriented) points;

* 2-morphisms are cobordisms between 1-dimensional cobordisms

* etc.

* (n+1)-morphims are _diffeomorphisms_ between $n$-dimensional cobordisms;

* (n+2)-morphisms are smooth homotopies of these;

* etc.

The $(\infinity,n)$-category of cobordisms is the subject of the [[cobordism hypothesis]].




#References#

A specific realization of this idea in terms of [[(∞,n)-category]] modeled as [[n-fold complete Segal space]] is in (definition 2.2.9, page 36)

*  [[Jacob Lurie]], [[On the Classification of Topological Field Theories]].

In that article a proof of the [[cobordism hypothesis]] is indicated.

A detailed construction of the [[(n,r)-category|(2,2)-category]] of cobordisms is

* Chris Schommer-Pries, [[2-category of 2-dimensional cobordisms]] .
