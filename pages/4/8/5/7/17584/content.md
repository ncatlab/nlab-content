**Affine logic** is a [[substructural logic]] which omits the [[contraction rule]]. 

Categorically, affine logic is modeled either by (symmetric) monoidal categories whose tensorial unit $I$ is terminal, or --- slightly more generally --- by (symmetric) monodial categories equipped with a family $A\to I$ of arrows (for all objects $A$), which is natural in $A$.

The existence of such a family of arrows does not force the tensorial unit to be terminal, as can be seen by the category $\mathbf{Rel}$ of relations, with cartesian product as tensor product. Here a natural family of relations $A\to I$ is given by picking empty relations everywhere.  However, it is a theorem that if the specified arrow $I\to I$ is the [[identity morphism]], then $I$ must indeed be terminal.
