##Idea
A **spacetime** is a [[smooth Lorentzian space]] $(X,\mu)$ equipped with a time orientation (see there).

In [[classical physics]], notably in [[Special Relativity]] and [[General Relativity]] points in $X$ model coordinates where _events_ can take place from the viewpoint of an observer ("points in space and time") while the metric $\mu$ models the field of [[gravity]] in [[General Relativity]].

###Remark on the physical meaning of points in General Relativity
In General Relativity every element of the [[atlas]] of the given spacetime is a valid coordinate system. Choose a chart $\phi$ of $(X,\mu)$, if $\phi^{-1}$ contains an open contractible _empty_ subset (containing nothing that could be observed), then there is a diffeomorphism that takes $\phi$ to a different chart $\phi'$ that "shrinks" this subset to a point. This means that a point alone, with nothing obverable attached to it, does not have an objective meaning in General Relativity ("objective" is "independent of the chosen observer resp. coordinate system"). As a tagline this reads:

Space and time do not exist on their own in General Relativity. If you remove all manifestations of energy from Newton's space and time, then space and time remain. If you remove all manifestations of energy from a spacetime in General Relativity, nothing remains.

The name spacetime as a composite noun is best motivated from the viewpoint of [[General Relativity]]: In general there is no globally defined coordinate system, and therefore not necessarily a globally defined _canonical_ time coordinate. More specifically, there are spacetimes that admit coordinates defined on subsets where the _physical_ interpretation of the coordinates as modelling time and space coordinates _changes_ over the domain of definition.
