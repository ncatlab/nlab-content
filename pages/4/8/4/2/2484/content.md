## Idea

In [[algebraic geometry]], there are two equivalent ways of looking at a [[scheme]]: it may be viewed 

1. as a [[petit topos]] with a [[structure sheaf]] of [[commutative rings]], hence as a [[locally ringed space]], 

1. as an object of the [[gros topos]] of [[sheaves]] on the [[site]] of [[commutative rings]] (with [[étale topology]] or [[Zariski topology]]) satisfying the condition that it is covered by [[representable functor|representables]] via [[open maps]].

In other words, a [[scheme]] may be identified with the [[sheaf]] it [[representable functor|represents]]; this sheaf is often called the _functor of points_ of the scheme.

To see this, note that by the [[Yoneda lemma]] a [[scheme]] may be identified with the [[sheaf]] it [[representable functor|represents]] on the gros [[Zariski site]] of [[schemes]]; and since any scheme admits an affine open cover, the [[comparison lemma]] says that [[sheaves]] on the [[site]] of all schemes may be identified with [[sheaves]] on the [[site]] of [[affine schemes]].

The functor of points approach has the advantage of making certain constructions much simpler (e.g. the [[fibered product]] in the category of schemes), and eliminating the need for certain constructions like the [[Zariski spectrum]]. In his famous [1973 Buffalo Colloquium talk](#Grothendieck73), [[Alexander Grothendieck]] urged that his earlier definition of scheme via [[locally ringed spaces]] should be abandoned in favour of the functorial point of view.

Of course, the above discussion generalizes to other types of [[geometry]] and even [[higher geometry]], the general perspective being known as _[[synthetic differential geometry]]_ or similar.  For discussion of functorial ([[higher differential geometry|higher]]) [[differential geometry]] see for instance at _[[smooth set]]_ ([[smooth ∞-groupoid]]), for discussion of functorial [[supergeometry]] see at _[[super formal smooth set]]_ ([[super formal smooth ∞-groupoid]]).

##Example

The functor from commutative rings to sets which sends a ring, $R$, to the set of simultaneous solutions in $R^n$ of a set of polynomials, $f_1, \ldots, f_k$ in $\mathbb{Z}[t_1, \ldots,t_n]$ corresponds to the affine scheme $X = Spec(\mathbb{Z}[t_1, \ldots,t_n]/(f_1, \ldots,f_k))$. These $R$-points are then equivalently the hom-space

$$
Hom_{schemes}(Spec(R), X).
$$

The functor which sends $R$ to the points of the projective space $\mathbb{P}^n_R$ corresponds to a non-affine scheme.
