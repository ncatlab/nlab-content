## Idea

In the context of [[nuclear physics]], by the *sign problem* in [[lattice quantum chromodynamics]] is is meant the issue that 

* for computational effectivity the [[partition function]] needs to be written as a (discretized) [[path integral]] of the exponentiated [[Euclidean field theory|Euclidean]] [[action functional]] against a [[probability density]] (the "quark matrix"), 

but 

* in many situations, notably at finite [[chemical potential]], the would-be [[probability]] [[measure]] turns out not to be positive definite, and in fact typically turns out to be [[complex number|complex]], 

* which means that various numerical evaluation methods fail.

The sign problem is one of the reasons that [[lattice QCD]] fails to be a fully satisfactory construction of [[non-perturbative quantum field theory|non-perturbative]] [[QCD]] even for practical purposes. For instance, much of the [[phase diagram]] of [[QCD]] remains unknown (e.g. [de Forcrand 13](#deForcrand13) [CQF21](#skyrmion#ChenQiuFukushima21)), since the sign problem prevents lattice QCD computations at "almost all points" in phase space ([Hsu-Reeb 08](#HsuReeb08)).
