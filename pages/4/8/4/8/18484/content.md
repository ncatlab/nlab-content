## Idea

In [[group cohomology]] theory, if $G$ is  a  [[group]]  which  has  [[torsion-free module|torsion-free]]  subgroups  of  [[finite index subgroup|finite index]], then all such subgroups have the same [[cohomological dimension]];  this common dimension  is  called  the  **virtual cohomological dimension** of $G$ and denoted $vcd(G)$.

For example, $SL_n(\mathbb{Z})$ has infinite cohomological dimension, and yet 

$$
vcd(SL_n(\mathbb{Z})) = \binom{n}{2}.
$$
