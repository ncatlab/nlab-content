An **equivalence relation** on a set $S$ is a binary [[relation]] $\equiv$ on $S$ that is:
* [[reflexive relation|reflexive]]: $x \equiv x$ for all $x: S$;
* [[symmetric relation|symmetric]]: $x \equiv y$ if $y \equiv x$; and
* [[transitive relation|transitive]]: $x \equiv z$ if $x \equiv y \equiv z$.

(One can also define it as a relation that is both reflexive and [[euclidean relation|euclidean]].)

Equivalently, an equivalence relation on $S$ is a way of making $S$ into the set of objects of a [[enriched category|groupoid enriched]] over the [[cartesian monoidal category]] of [[truth value]]s.

A [[setoid]] is a set equipped with an equivalence relation.  That is, the setoid is the entire structure of the groupoid enriched over truth values.

In a [[finitely complete category]] $C$, an **equivalence relation** on an [[object]] $X$ is a monomorphism $R\hookrightarrow X\times X$ which is "internally reflexive, transitive, and symmetric."  (add explicit versions of this)

Any [[kernel pair]] is an equivalence relation.  An equivalence relation which is the kernel pair of some morphism is called **effective**.  A [[regular category]] is called an [[exact category]] if every equivalence relation is effective.
