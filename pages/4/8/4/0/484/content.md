## Definition

An __equivalence relation__ on a set $S$ is a binary [[relation]] $\equiv$ on $S$ that is:

* [[reflexive relation|reflexive]]: $x \equiv x$ for all $x: S$;
* [[symmetric relation|symmetric]]: $x \equiv y$ if $y \equiv x$; and
* [[transitive relation|transitive]]: $x \equiv z$ if $x \equiv y \equiv z$.

Thus, an equivalence relation is a **symmetric [[preorder]]**. 

(One can also define it as a relation that is both reflexive and [[euclidean relation|euclidean]].)  The [[de Morgan duality|de Morgan dual]] of an equivalence relation is an [[apartness relation]]. 

If $R$ is any relation on $S$, there is a smallest equivalence relation containing $R$ (noting that an intersection of an arbitrary family of equivalence relations is again such; see also [[Moore closure]]), called the equivalence relation *generated by* $R$. 

## In homotopy type theory

In homotopy type theory, since [[propositions]] are [[subsingletons]], an equivalence relation on a type $T$ is a type family $x \equiv y$ indexed by elements $x:T$ and $y:T$ with witnesses of reflexivity, transitivity, and symmetry, and propositional truncation:

$$\mathrm{refl}(x):x \equiv x$$

$$\mathrm{trans}(x, y, z):x \equiv y \times y \equiv z \to x \equiv z$$

$$\mathrm{sym}(x, y):x \equiv y \to y \equiv x$$

$$\mathrm{proptrunc}(x, y):\prod_{p:x \equiv y} \prod_{q:x \equiv y} p = q$$

One then further distinguishes between a [[type]] with an equivalence relation (a symmetric preordered type) and an [[h-set]] with an equivalence relation (a symmetric [[proset]]). 

### Extensional functions

Let $A \coloneqq (A_0, \equiv_A)$ and $B:\coloneqq (B_0, \equiv_B)$ be two symmetric preordered types. An **[[extensional function]]** $f:A \to B$ consists of a function $f_0:A_0 \to B_0$ and for all elements $a:A_0$ and $b:A_0$ a function $f_\equiv(a, b):(a \equiv_A b) \to (f_0(a) \equiv_B f_0(b))$. 

The identity function $id_A:A \to A$ is an extensional function which consists of the identity function $id_{A_0}:A_0 \to A_0$ for all elements $a:A_0$ and $b:A_0$, the identity function $id_\equiv(a, b):(a \equiv_A b) \to (a \equiv_A b))$. 

Given symmetric preordered types $A \coloneqq (A_0, \equiv_A)$, $B:\coloneqq (B_0, \equiv_B)$, and $C \coloneqq (C_0, \equiv_C)$, the composition $g \circ f:A \to C$ of extensional functions $f:A \to B$ and $g:B \to C$ is defined as 
$$(g \circ f)_0 \coloneqq g_0 \circ f_0$$ 
and for all objects $a:A_0$ and $b:A_0$, 
$$(g \circ f)_\equiv(a, b) \coloneqq g_equiv(f_0(a), f_0(b)) \circ f_equiv(a, b)$$

### Injections, surjections, and bijections

An extensional function $f:A \to B$ is a **[[injection]]** if for all elements $b:B_0$ the type of elements $a:A_0$ with a witness $p(a, b):f_0(a) \equiv b$ is a [[subsingleton]].

An extensional function $f:A \to B$ is a **[[surjection]]** if for all elements $b:B_0$ the type of elements $a:A_0$ with a witness $p(a, b):f_0(a) \equiv b$ is a [[pointed type]].

An extensional function $f:A \to B$ is a **[[bijection]]** if it is both an [[injection]] and a [[surjection]]; i.e. for all elements $b:B_0$ the type of elements $a:A_0$ with a witness $p(a, b):f_0(a) \equiv b$ is a pointed subsingleton, or a [[singleton]].

### Bijections, isomorphisms, and equivalences

An extensional function $f:A \to B$ is a **[[bijection]]** if for all elements $b:B_0$ the type of elements $a:A_0$ with a witness $p(a, b):f_0(a) \equiv b$ is a [[singleton]].

An extensional function $f:A \to B$ is an **[[isomorphism]]** if there exist an extensional functiom $g:B \to A$ with witnesses $\mathrm{ret}(f, g):g \circ f = id_{A}$ and $\mathrm{sec}(f, g):f \circ g = id_{B}$. 

An extensional function $f:A \to B$ is an **[[equivalence]]** if the function $f_0:A_0 \to B_0$ is an equivalence of types and for all elements $a:A_0$ and $b:A_0$ the function $f_\equiv(a, b):(a \equiv_A b) \to (f_0(a) \equiv_B f_0(b))$ is an equivalence of types. 

The only symmetric preordered types for which bijection, isomorphism, and equivalence are the same are the symmetric posets, which are the [[h-sets]]. 

## A categorical view

A set equipped with an equivalence relation can be regarded as a [[groupoid]] [[enriched category|enriched]] over the [[cartesian monoidal category]] of [[truth values]].  Equivalently, it is a [[groupoid]] that is [[0-truncated]].  Then the equivalence relation on $S$ is a way of making $S$ into the set of objects of such a groupoid.  Equivalently, a set with an equivalence relation is a [[(0,1)-category]] whose each morphism is iso, or a [[symmetric relation|symmetric]] [[preordered set]]. 

It may well be useful to consider several possible equivalence relations on a given set.  When considering a single equivalence relation once and for all, however, it is common to take the [[quotient set]] $S/_{\equiv}$ and use that instead.  As a groupoid, any set with an equivalence relation is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to a [[set]] in this way (although in the absence of the [[axiom of choice]], it is only a "weak" or [[anafunctor|ana-equivalence]]).

A set equipped with an equivalence relation is sometimes called a __[[setoid]]__; however the term [[setoid]] is primarily used for a [[pseudo-equivalence relation]] instead, and the usage on the nLab follows the latter. 

This terminology is particularly common in [[foundations]] of mathematics where quotient sets don\'t always exist and the above equivalence to a set cannot be carried out.  However, arguably this is a terminological mismatch, and such people should say 'set' where they say 'setoid' and something else (such as '[[preset]]', '[[type]]', or '[[completely presented set]]') where they say 'set'.  (See [[Bishop set]] and page 9 of [these lecture notes](http://www.cs.chalmers.se/Cs/Research/Logic/TypesSS05/Extra/palmgren.pdf).)

## Variants and generalizations

* A _[[partial equivalence relation]]_ is a symmetric and transitive relation. 

* A _[[congruence]]_ is a notion of equivalence relation [[internalization|internal]] to a suitable [[category]].

* The generalization of this to [[(∞,1)-category theory]] is that of _[[groupoid object in an (∞,1)-category]]_.
