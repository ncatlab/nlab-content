# Equivalence relations

## Definition

An __equivalence relation__ on a set $S$ is a binary [[relation]] $\equiv$ on $S$ that is:

* [[reflexive relation|reflexive]]: $x \equiv x$ for all $x: S$;
* [[symmetric relation|symmetric]]: $x \equiv y$ if $y \equiv x$; and
* [[transitive relation|transitive]]: $x \equiv z$ if $x \equiv y \equiv z$.

(One can also define it as a relation that is both reflexive and [[euclidean relation|euclidean]].)  The [[de Morgan duality|de Morgan dual]] of an equivalence relation is an [[apartness relation]]. 

If $R$ is any relation on $S$, there is a smallest equivalence relation containing $S$ (noting that an intersection of an arbitrary family of equivalence relations is again such; see also [[Moore closure]]), called the equivalence relation *generated by* $R$. 


## A categorical view

A set equipped with an equivalence relation can be regarded as a [[groupoid]] [[enriched category|enriched]] over the [[cartesian monoidal category]] of [[truth values]].  Equivalently, it is a [[groupoid]] that is [[0-truncated]].  Then the equivalence relation on $S$ is a way of making $S$ into the set of objects of such a groupoid.  Equivalently, a set with an equivalence relation is a [[(0,1)-category]] whose each morphism is iso, or a [[symmetric relation|symmetric]] [[preordered set]]. 

It may well be useful to consider several possible equivalence relations on a given set.  When considering a single equivalence relation once and for all, however, it is common to take the [[quotient set]] $S/_{\equiv}$ and use that instead.  As a groupoid, any set with an equivalence relation is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to a [[set]] in this way (although in the absence of the [[axiom of choice]], it is only a "weak" or [[anafunctor|ana-equivalence]]).

A set equipped with an equivalence relation is sometimes called a __[[setoid]]__, although at other times that term is used for a [[pseudo-equivalence relation]] instead.  This terminology is particularly common in [[foundations]] of mathematics where quotient sets don\'t always exist and the above equivalence to a set cannot be carried out.  However, arguably this is a terminological mismatch, and such people should say 'set' where they say 'setoid' and something else (such as '[[preset]]', '[[type]]', or '[[completely presented set]]') where they say 'set'.  (See [[Bishop set]] and page 9 of [these lecture notes](http://www.cs.chalmers.se/Cs/Research/Logic/TypesSS05/Extra/palmgren.pdf).)


## Variants and generalizations

* A _[[partial equivalence relation]]_ is a symmetric and transitive relation. 

* A _[[congruence]]_ is a notion of equivalence relation [[internalization|internal]] to a suitable [[category]].

* The generalization of this to [[(∞,1)-category theory]] is that of _[[groupoid object in an (∞,1)-category]]_.
