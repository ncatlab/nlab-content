## Idea

Given a [[small category]] $S$, we may consider freely adjoining (small) [[colimits]] to $S$, giving the [[free cocompletion]] of $S$. Concretely, this is the [[category of presheaves]] on $S$. Dually, we may consider freely adjoining (small) [[limits]] to $S$, giving the [[free completion]] of $S$. Concretely, this is the [[category of copresheaves]] on $S$.

Alternatively, we may consider freely adjoining both (small) limits *and* colimits to $S$ simultaneously. (Note that this means there will be no [[distributivity of limits and colimits]].) This is known as the **free bicompletion** of $S$.

Unlike the [[free completion]] or [[free cocompletion]], it is not known whether a concrete description of the free bicompletion of a small category exists.

Abstractly, the free bicompletion construction is the [[coproduct]] of the two [[2-monads]] associated to the [[free completion]] and the [[free cocompletion]].
