#Idea#

An $(\infty,1)$-category is a (weak) [[infinity-category]] in which all $n$-morphisms for $n \geq 2$ are [[equivalence]]s.

#Definition#

By definition, the [[model category]] of $(\infty,1)$-categories is one which is [[Quillen equivalence|Quillen equivalent]] to any one of

 * [[simplicially enriched category|simplicially enriched categories]];

 * [[Segal category|Segal categories]];

 * complete Segal spaces;

 * [[quasi-category|quasi-categories]].
