#Idea#

According to the general pattern on [[(n,r)-category]], an $(\infty,1)$-category is a (weak) [[∞-category]] in which all $n$-morphisms for $n \geq 2$ are [[equivalences]].

To some extent an $(\infty,1)$-category can be thought of as a [[enriched category|category enriched in]] [[(∞,0)-categories]], namely in [[∞-groupoids]].

For a discussion of the motivation and purpose of $(\infty,1)$-categories see [[why (∞,1)-categories?]].


#Definitions#

There are a number of different ways to make the idea of an $(\infty,1)$-category precise, including [[quasi-categories]], [[simplicial set|simplicially]] [[enriched categories]], topologically enriched categories, [[Segal categories]], [[complete Segal spaces]], and $A_\infty$-[[A-infinity categories|categories]] (most of which can be done either simplicially or topologically).  Additionally, any notion of [[∞-category]] can be specialized to a notion of $(\infty,1)$-category by simply requiring all $n$-cells for $n\gt 1$ to be invertible.

Unlike the case for general notions of $n$-category, almost all the definitions of $(\infty,1)$-category are known to form [[model categories]] that are [[Quillen equivalence|Quillen equivalent]].  See also [[n-category]] for a summary of the state of the art about definitions of $n$-category and comparisons between them.

## quasi-categories ##

We start with the definition of "$(\infty,1)$-category" that was promoted by [[Andre Joyal]] as a good model for the theory. This goes back to Boardman-Vogt.

This is a [[geometric definition of higher category]] which conceives an $(\infty,1)$-category as a [[simplicial set]] with extra [[stuff, structure, property|property]]. It is a straightforward generalization of the definition of [[∞-groupoid]] as a [[Kan complex]]. 

Recall that a [[Kan complex]] is a [[simplicial set]] in which every [[horn]] $\Lambda^k[n]$, $0 \leq k \leq n$ has a _filler_. This condition may be read in words as: every collection of adjacent $n$-cells has a composite $n$-cell, even if the orientations of the cells don't match. This implicitly encodes the _invertibility_ of every cell: if the orientation does not match, we can invert the cell and then compose.

From this perspective one observes, by looking closely at the combinatorics, that the invertibility of the 1-cells in the simplicial set is enforced particularly by the condition that the [[horn|outer horns] $\Lambda^0[n]$ and $\Lambda^n[n]$ have fillers.

Therefore in a [[simplicial set]] in which _only the inner horns_ $\Lambda^k[n]$ for $0 \lt k \lt n$ have fillers all cells are required to have a kind of inverse, except the 1-cells. (They may have inverses, too, but are not required to).

This is evidently a realization of the idea of an [[(n,r)-category]] with $n = \infty$ and $r = 1$.


Such a simplicial set with fillers for all inner horns

* Boardman and Vogt called a _weak Kan complex_ ; 

* [[Andre Joyal]] called a [[quasi-category]];

* [[Jacob Lurie]] called an $\infty$-category.
 
Here we follow Joyal and say [[quasi-category]] when we mean concretely the simplicial sets with extra property. We use more generally term 
"$(\infty,1)$-category" for this or any of its equivalent models, discussed below, in order to distinguish from the term [[∞-category]] or [[∞-category]] that is more traditionally understood to generically mean an $\infty$-category with no conditions on invertibility 
(in terms of [[(n,r)-category]]: an $(\infty,\infty)$-category).


With [[quasi-category|quasi-categories]] being just [[simplicial sets]] with extra property, there are evident and simple definitions of 

* the [[(infinity,1)-category of (infinity,1)-functors|quasi-category of (∞,1)-functors|]] between two [[quasi-categories]] $C$ and $D$;

* the quasi-category of all [[∞-groupoids]];

* the [[(infinity,1)-category of (infinity,1)-categories|quasi-category of all quasi-categories]].

Similarly, [[Andre Joyal]] and [[Jacob Lurie]] have shown that all other constructions in [[category theory]] have good generalizations to quasi-categories, which usually have conceptually simple formulations: see [[Higher Topos Theory]] for more.


## model categories ##

At the very beginning, a [[model category]] was understood as a "model for the category [[Top]] of topological spaces," or more precisely [[homotopy types]]: some [[category]] with extra [[stuff, structure, property|structure and properties]] which allows one to perform all operations familiar of the [[homotopy theory]] of [[topological spaces]].

As mentioned above, from the point of view of [[(∞,1)-categories]], [[Top]] may naturally be regarded an as [[(∞,1)-category]] and is in fact the archetypical example, analogous to how [[Set]] is the archetypical examples of an ordinary [[category]].

This indicates that, more generally, a [[model category]] should actually be a means to model (i.e. encode) in 1-categorical terms an $(\infty,1)$-category.  This indeed turns out to be true: there is a precise sense in which every [[model category]] [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presents]] an $(\infty,1)$-category.

* given a model category $A$;

* it becomes canonically an [[SimpSet|SSet]]-[[enriched category]] making it a [[simplicial model category]] $\mathbf{A}$;

* the full [[SimpSet|SSet]]-[[subcategory]] $\mathbf{A}^\circ$ on the fibrant-cofibrant objects of $\mathbf{A}$ happens to be [[Kan complex]]-[[enriched category|enriched]];

* the [[homotopy coherent nerve]] $N(\mathbf{A}^\circ)$ of $\mathbf{A}^\circ$ is the [[quasi-category]] _presented_ by $A$.

With the relation between [[simplicial object in Cat|simplical categories]] and [[quasi-category|quasi-categories]] via [[homotopy coherent nerve]] understood, we shall here often not distinguish between $\mathbf{A}^\circ$ and $N(\mathbf{A}^\circ)$ as the $(\infty,1)$-category [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presented]] by the [[model category]] $A$.

The following analogy (appearing in this way on [p. 44 of Ben-Zvi/Nadler07](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/0706/0706.0322v1.pdf#page=44)) might illustrate how model categories, $(\infty,1)$-categories and homotopy categories relate

: model category &rarr; $(\infty,1)$-category &rarr; homotopy category
: vector space with basis &rarr; vector space &rarr; dimension of vector space

Note, though, that not every $(\infty,1)$-category can be presented by a model category: only those that are [[locally presentable (∞,1)-category|locally presentable]].


## $Top$-, $Kan$- and simplicially enriched categories ##

As the above example of presentations by [[model category|model categories]]
already indicates,
despite the conceptual simplicity of [[quasi-category|quasi-categories]],
for computations and in particular for obtaining examples, 
it is often useful to pass to a slightly different model.

Recall that we said at the beginning that an $(\infty,1)$-category is supposed to be like an  [[enriched category]] which is enriched over the category of [[∞-groupoids]]. 
This turns out to make sense literally
if one takes care to remember that $\infty$-groupoids
themselves form a higher category.

As discussed at  [[homotopy hypothesis]] there is a Quillen equivalence of the [[model category|model categories]] of 

* the [[model structure on topological spaces|standard model structure]] on the [[nice category of spaces|nice category]] of compactly generated weakly Hausdorff [[topological spaces]];

* the [[model structure on simplicial sets|standard model structure]] on the category of [[Kan complex]]es.

In fact, this is also equivalent to

* the [[model structure on simplicial sets|standard model structure]] on the category [[SimpSet|SSet]] of [[simplicial sets]].

If we take the notion of [[Kan complex]] to be the most manifest incarnation of the idea "[[∞-groupoid]]", then under these equivalences one may think of

* a [[simplicial set]] as representing the [[Kan complex]] which is obtained from it by "freely throwing in the missing inverses" of cells (technically: as representing its fibrant replacement);

* a [[topological space]] $X$ as representing the [[Kan complex]] $\Pi(X)$, whose 

  * 0-cells are the points of $X$;
  
  * 1-cells are the paths in $X$;
  
  * 2-cells are the triangles in $X$;
  
  * etc.
  
With this interpretation understood (i.e. with these model structures understood), [[SimpSet|SSet]]-enriched categories do model $(\infty,1)$-categories. 

For more see

* [[relation between quasi-categories and simplicial categories]]



## Segal categories and complete Segal spaces ##

Other models for $(\infty,1)$-categories are

 * [[Segal category|Segal categories]];

 * [[complete Segal spaces]].
 
These notions can be thought of as categories which are
_weakly_ enriched in topological spaces/simplicial sets/Kan complexes,
where the definition of "weak" makes use of the notion of [[homotopy]]
and [[homotopy limit]] in [[Top]] or [[SimpSet|SSet]].

(Actually, complete Segal spaces are actualy more like [[internal categories]] in spaces which satisfy an extra "completeness" condition specifying that the extra data are redundant.  But including this extra data turns out to be technically convenient in many ways.)

This construction principle in particular lends itself
to iteration and hence to an inductive definition of 
[[(∞,n)-category]].


## $A_\infty$-categories

An $A_\infty$-[[A-infinity category|category]] can also be thought of as a category "weakly enriched" in spaces (i.e. $\infty$-groupoids), except that in contrast to the Segal approaches the "weakness" is specified [[algebraic definition of higher category|algebraically]] and parametrized by an [[operad]].  This approach can be generalized to the [[Trimble n-category|Trimble]] definition of $n$-category or $(\infty,n)$-category.


#References#

For several years [[Andre Joyal]] -- who was the one to promote the idea that for studying [[higher category theory]] it is good to first study $(\infty,1)$-categories in terms of [[quasi-category|quasi-categories]] -- has been preparing a textbook on the subject. This still doesn't quite exist, but an extensive writup of lecture notes does:

* [[Andre Joyal]], _The theory of quasicategories and its applications_ lectures at [Simplicial Methods in Higher Categories](http://www.crm.es/HigherCategories/), ([pdf](http://www.crm.cat/HigherCategories/hc2.pdf))

Meanwhile [[Jacob Lurie]], building on Joyal's work, has considerably pushed the theory further. A comprehensive discussion of the theory of $(\infty,1)$-categories in terms of the models [[quasi-category]] and [[simplicially enriched category]] is

* [[Jacob Lurie]], _[[Higher Topos Theory]]_ .

A useful comparison of the four [[model category]] structures on

 * [[quasi-categories]];

 * [[simplicially enriched categories]];

 * [[Segal categories]];

 * [[complete Segal spaces]].

is in
