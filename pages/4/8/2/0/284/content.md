#Idea#

An $(\infty,1)$-category is a (weak) [[higher category theory|higher category]] in which all $n$-morphisms for $n \geq 2$ are [[equivalence]]s.

#Definition#

By definition, the [[model category]] of $(\infty,1)$-categories is one which is [[Quillen equivalence|Quillen equivalent]] to any one of

 * simplicially [[enriched category|enriched categories]];

 * Segal categories;

 * complete Segal spaces;

 * [[quasi-category|quasi-categories]].
