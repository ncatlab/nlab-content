A **subquotient** of an object $X$ in some category is a [[quotient object]] of a [[subobject]] of $X$, or a subobject of a quotient object of $X$.  The two are equivalent whenever quotients are [[pullback stability|stable under pullback]] and subobjects are stable under pushout, such as in a [[topos]]. Just as with subobjects and quotient objects, we have that $X$ is a subquotient of itself, and subquotients of subquotients of $X$ are themselves subquotients of $X$ in a natural way.

Just as subobjects of a set $X$ are in correspondence with predicates on $X$ and quotients of $X$ are in correspondence with [[equivalence relation]]s on $X$, subquotients of $X$ are in correspondence with [[partial equivalence relation]]s on $X$.
