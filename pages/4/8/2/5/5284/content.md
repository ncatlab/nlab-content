## Idea

The _free loop space_ of a [[topological space]] is the space of all loops in $X$. As opposed to the based [[loop space]] the loops are not required to sit on a fixed base point.

## Definition


For $X$ a [[topological space]], the **free loop space** $L X$ of $X$ is the [[free loop space object]] of $X$ formed in the [[(infinity,1)-category]] [[Top]].
