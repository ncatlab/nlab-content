######Definition
The _crossing number_, $c(K)$, of $K$ is the minimum number of crossings in a [[knot diagram]] in the [[isotopy class]] of $K$. 
=--

The crossing number is thus the number of crossings in the simplest picture of a knot.  A diagram of a knot $K$ with exactly $c(K)$ crossings is called a _minimal_ diagram.

## Examples

* for the [[unknot]]: $c(unknot) = 0$;

* for the [[trefoil knot]]: $c(trefoil) = 3$;

* for the [[figure eight knot]]: $c(figure-8) = 4$.

* if a [[knot diagram]] has $1$ or $2$ crossings it represents the [[unknot]], so there are no non-trivial knots with $c(K) = 1$ or $2$.

The crossing number is related to the [[unknotting number]], but in quite a subtle way.

## References

In the books by Burde and Zeischang (1985) and Kauffman (1987), the tables of knots are arranged according to crossing number.  (Choices have been made of one mirror image or the other.)
Given some arbitrary diagram, the crossing number of the knot that it respresents may be hard to determine.
