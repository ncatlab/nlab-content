This page describes _homotopy.io_, a web-based [[proof assistant]] for finitely-presented [[globular set|globular]] [[n-category|_n_-categories]], for arbitrary $n$. It is available at the following address:

* [https://homotopy.io](https://homotopy.io)

It is based on the theory of [[associative n-categories|associative _n_-categories (ANCs)]], which provides a strictly associative and unital model of composition. This reduces proof bureaucracy, with all the remaining weak structure in homotopies of composites, which a direct geometrical interpretation. The proof assistant allows the user to define [[generators and relations|generators]] for a [[higher category]], [[composition|compose]] them, apply [[homotopies]], and visualize the resulting composites as [[string diagrams]] in 2 dimensions or [[surface diagrams]] in 3 dimensions. Interaction with the proof assistant is entirely by direct manipulation using the mouse.

It can be considered a successor to the existing proof assistant [[Globular]], which allows the construction of formal proofs in a strictly associative and unital model of [[4-categories]].

Homotopy construction in _homotopy.io_ is enabled by two basic mechanisms: _contraction_, which makes the geometry locally more singular; and _expansion_, which makes the geometry locally more generic. These local moves 'drag' neighbouring parts of the composite, and allow the construction of nontrivial [[homotopies]]. It is an open question whether these contraction and expansion moves are capable of generating all possible homotopies in every dimension.

The image at the top-right shows a 3d surface diagram of one side of the [[pentagon equation]] ([_live workspace_](https://homotopy.io/?id=kzmugNEGMPBF8BbB5FAm)).

### Contributors ###

The proof assistant is based on the theory of [[associative n-categories|associative _n_-categories]], which has been worked on by [Christoph Dorn](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/christoph.dorn/), [Christopher Douglas](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/christopher.douglas), [David Reutter](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/david.reutter/) and [Jamie Vicary](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~vicaryjo/). The proof assistant has been implemented by [Lukas Heidemann](https://github.com/zrho), [Nick Hu](https://github.com/NickHu) and [Jamie Vicary](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~vicaryjo/).

## Functionality

### Overview ###

Using _homotopy.io_ involves two main techniques: building the signature, and building diagrams over that signature. The signature is the list of cells that are available, and a diagram is a particular composite of those cells. An diagram can be thought of a composite morphism in the free associative $n$-category generated by the signature.

**Signatures.** In dimension 0, generating cells can be constructed by clicking the "+" symbol next to the heading "0-cells". In dimension $n+1$, a cell is defined by two pieces of data, its source $n$-diagram and its target $n$-diagram. We add such a cell by building an $n$-diagram $S$, clicking 'Source' to choose it as the source of the new generator, then building a $n$-diagram $T$, and clicking 'Target' to choose it as the target of the new generator. The new cell will then appear in the signature.

**Diagrams.** An $n$-diagram is a composite of $k$-cells from the signature, for $k \leq n$. To build a diagram, we first click on the thumbnail of a cell in the signature, which will display it in the central window. We can then compose it with other cells, by clicking near the boundary. We can also rewrite parts of it, by clicking in the interior of the diagram.

**Homotopies.** Once a diagram has been constructed, we can modify it using homotopies, triggered by clicking and dragging on the diagram. If this is performed on the boundary of the diagram, it will attach the homotopy to the boundary of the diagram, making it larger. If this is performed in the interior of the diagram, it will rewrite the diagram.
