The main theorem is a [[Tannaka duality|Tannakian reconstruction theorem]], which repairs a problem in the book

which had a substantial gap in the proof of the main theorem.

At the end of the article there is an application to the [[differential Galois theory]] (which has been earlier much studied by A. R. Magid) which is the Galois theory for differential rather than algebraic equations. 

The article had a huge influence not only in Tannakian theory but also in creating more technical exchange between the modern [[algebraic geometry]] with [[category theory]] and [[bialgebra|bi(al)gebras]].

the conditions for Tannakian reconstruction are relaxed further, see at _[[Deligne's theorem on tensor categories]]_.

Generalization to "non-neutral" Tannakian categories, and representations of [[gerbes]] is in
