This entry will be about Pierre Deligne's article

__Cat&#233;gories Tannakiennes__, [[Grothendieck Festschrift]], vol. II,  Birkh&#228;user Progress in Math. 87 (1990) pp.111-195.

The main theorem is a Tannakian reconstruction theorem, which repairs a problem in the book 

* N. Saavedra Rivano, _Cat&#233;gories Tannakiennes_, Springer LNM 265, 1972 

which had a substantial gap in the proof of the main theorem.

The article had a huge influence not only in Tannakian theory but also in creating more technical exchange between the modern algebraic geometry with category theory and bi(al)gebras.

There will be later a separate entry on Tannakian reconstructions.
