## Idea

The notion of a *partially ordered object* is the generalization of that of *[[partially ordered sets]]* as one passes from the ambient [[category of sets]] [[internalization|into]] more general ambient  [[categories]] with suitable properties.

## Definitions

In a [[finitely complete category]] $C$, a **partially ordered object** is a [[preordered object]] $(X, R, s, t, \rho, \tau_p)$ such that the internal preorder $R\stackrel{(s,t)}\hookrightarrow X \times X$ is an [[internal antisymmetric relation]].
