## Idea

(...)

## In point-free topology

It is argued in ([Simpson 12](#Simpson12)) that the Banach-Tarski paradox disappears if one works in [[point-free topology]], hence with [[locales]] instead of just [[topological spaces]]:

> We view spaces of interest as [[locales]], and the notion of "part" is given by the standard notion of [[sublocale]], $[\cdots]$. Every [[topological space]] determines a [[locale]] $[\cdots]$.  However, when a space is viewed as a locale, the notion of [[sublocale]] gives rise to new "parts" of spaces that are not merely subsets, and need  not  be  determined by their points.

> The usual contradictions are avoided $[$this way$]$. The different pieces in  the partitions defined by Vitali and by Banach and Tarski are deeply intertangled with  each  other.  According  to  our  notion  of "part",  two  such  intertangled pieces are not disjoint from each other, so additivity does not apply. An intuitive explanation for the failure of disjointness is that, although two such pieces share no point in common, they nevertheless overlap on the topological “glue” that bonds neighbouring points together.
