## Idea

There are two general approaches to [[structural set theory]]; those that attempt to axiomatise the [[category]] [[Set]] of [[sets]] and [[functions]], and those that attempt to axiomatise the [[allegory]] [[Rel]] of [[sets]] and [[relations]]. The latter is called **allegorical set theory**. 

## Examples

* [[SEAR]] is an example of a dependently sorted allegorical set theory with primitives of [[sets]], [[elements]], and [[relations]]
