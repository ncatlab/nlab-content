## Idea

In [[set theory]], **forcing** is a way of "adjoining indeterminate objects" to a model in order to make certain [[axiom|axioms]] true or false in a resulting new model.  The language of forcing is generally used in [[material set theory]], but it is more or less equivalent to the construction of [[categories of sheaves]] in [[topos theory]] and [[structural set theory]].


## An analogy to polynomial rings

There are three ways in which to describe the construction of forcing, which can be explained by analogy to a situation in algebra.  Suppose that we have a [[ring]] $R$ and we want to know what $R$ would be like if it had a nilsquare element, i.e. an $x$ such that $x^2=0$, although we don't know whether $R$ *actually* has any nilsquare elements.  There are several things we could do.

1. We could consider some larger ring $S$ which contains $R$ as a subring, and also contains some nilsquare element $x$, and then study the subring of $S$ generated by $R$ and $x$, using only our knowledge that it contains $R$ and $x$ and that $x$ is nilsquare.

1. We could work formally in the [[theory]] of $R$ with an extra variable $x$ and the axiom that $x^2=0$, avoiding consideration of any new rings at all.

1. We could construct the polynomial ring $R[x]$ and quotient by the ideal $(x^2)$, resulting in the *universal* ring $R[x]/(x^2)$ containing $R$ and also a nilsquare element.

Obviously these are more or less equivalent ways of doing the same thing.  Arguably, most modern mathematicians would find the third the most natural.  It is certainly the most [[category theory|category-theoretic]] and the most in line with the [[nPOV]].

Now suppose instead that we have a model $V$ of [[ZF]] set theory (for instance), and we want to know what $V$ would be like if it contained a set $G$ satisfying some particular properties.  We can likewise take three approaches.

1. We can assume that $V$ sits inside some larger model of ZF, in such a way that there is a set $G$ outside of $V$ and the "model generated by $V$ and $G$" called $V[G]$ satisfies the desired properties.  The $G$ is called a *generic* set for the desired "notion of forcing."  There is an extra wrinkle in this approach in that such a $G$ will not generally exist unless we assume that $V$ is [[countable set|countable]].  But for purposes of independence proofs in [[classical mathematics]], this is no problem, since the downward [[LÃ¶wenheim-Skolem theorem]] guarantees that if ZF is consistent, then it has a countable model.

1. We can define a new notion of "truth" for statements about $V$, which is not the same as the old one, and which will usually take values not in ordinary [[truth values]] but in some more complicated [[Boolean algebra]] (or [[Heyting algebra]]), in such a way so that the statement "there exists a $G$ with the desired properties" is "true."  This is called *forcing semantics*.

1. We can construct a new model of set theory out of whole cloth from $V$, rather than trying to find it as a submodel of some assumed larger model.  In material set theory, this construction is usually called a *Boolean valued model* (or a *Heyting valued model* if it is [[constructive mathematics|intuitionistic]]).  In structural set theory, this construction is simply a [[topos of sheaves]].  The topos of sheaves is moreover *universal* over $V$ such that it contains a $G$ satisfying the desired properties in its [[internal logic]]---in other words, it is a [[classifying topos]] of the theory of such a $G$.

Although by analogy, it would seem that a modern perspective should prefer the third approach, most material set theorists still seem to prefer one of the first two.
