## Overview

There are a few major differences between [[set theory]] and [[dependent type theory]]. 

### Logic

Set theory of all flavors, including [[material set theory]] and [[structural set theory]], have two notions of logic, 

* the external [[predicate logic]] with primitive notions of [[proposition]], [[true]], [[false]], [[conjunction]], [[disjunction]], [[implication]], [[existential quantifier]], and [[universal quantifier]]

* the [[internal logic]] built from [[subsingletons]], the [[singleton]], the [[empty set]], binary [[products]] of two subsingletons, the [[support]] of the binary [[disjoint union]] of two subsingletons, [[function sets]] of two subsingletons, the support of the indexed disjoint union of a family of subsingletons, and the indexed product of a [[family of subsets|family of subsingletons]]. 

Dependent type theory only has one notion of logic, which would correspond to the internal logic of the set theory. Thus, propositions are subsingletons. 

However, with the [[axiom of extensionality]] or [[function extensionality]] usually assumed in [[set theory]], which correspond to a [[well-pointed category]], the external and internal predicate logic coincide with each other, so the fact that there are two logics in set theory isn't as relevant in mathematics as one might think. Nonetheless, the fact that set theory has an external logic means that when setting up the set theory, one needs to add many [[inference rules]] for the external predicate logic. This is in contrast to [[dependent type theory]], where the internal predicate logic is already derivable from the existing type formers: [[dependent product types]], [[dependent sum types]], [[identity types]], and the [[type of all propositions]], and so one doesn't need to add any additional inference rules specifically for the logic. 

### Equality

Set theory of all flavors have only one notion of equality, [[propositional equality]], which is a proposition in the external predicate logic. 

Most dependent type theories, like [[Martin-LÃ¶f type theory]], [[cubical type theory]], ([[higher observational type theory|higher]]) [[observational type theory]], [[two-level type theory]], [[simplicial type theory]], et cetera, all have two notions of equality, [[judgmental equality]] and [[typal equality]]. 

The only dependent type theory which only has one notion of equality is [[objective type theory]], and corresponds to typal equality. 

In addition, the equality in all set theories are by definition propositions, while only in [[set-level type theories]] such as those with [[UIP]], [[axiom K]], or [[boundary separation]] have subsingleton-valued typal equality. More general dependent type theories have equalities which could be sets, or types representing [[infinity-groupoids]]. 


### Functions
 {#Functions}

[[category theory|Categorical]]$\;$[[set theory]] has two notions of [[functions]], either as [[elements]] of [[function sets]] $f \in B^A$ or as a primitives $f \colon A \to B$ in the set theory. One could compare functions for [[equality]] in either case.

On the other hand, [[dependent type theory]] has only one notion of function which could be compared for equality: an element of a [[function type]] $f \colon A \to B$. The corresponding primitive notion is the concept of [[family of elements]] $x \colon A \vdash f(x) \colon B$, of which there is no corresponding notion of equality of a family of elements.
