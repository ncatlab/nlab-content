##Idea##
The discussion in [[trace alphabet]] describes how in a state based system where there is a notion of (causal) independence on certain actions, the usual use of the free monoid on the set of actions is better replaced by a construction taking the independence into account. That construction gives the **trace monoid**.

Let $(\Sigma,I)$ be a [[trace alphabet]]:

##Definition##
The **trace monoid**, $M(\Sigma,I)$, of the trace alphabet, $(\Sigma,I)$, is the monoid, with presentation $\langle \Sigma\mid I\rangle$, where to an independent pair $(a,b)$ corresponds the pair of words (relations), $(ab,ba)$.
 The resulting monoid is thus formed by taking $\Sigma^*/\equiv$, where $\equiv$ is the congruence relation generated by the relations. The elements of $M(\Sigma,I)$ are usually called **traces**.
