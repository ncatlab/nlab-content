At the moment, this is a "place holder" page.  [[Andrew Stacey|I]] want to learn about the appearance of [[algebraic theories]] in [[functional analysis]] and shall record what I learn here.  A preliminary outline is to find out about the following statements:

1. The category of [[Banach spaces]] with contractions (you mean linear [[short maps]]? --Toby) is [[monadic category|monadic]] over Set but not [[algebraic category|algebraic]].  The "nearest" algebraic theory is that of [[totally convex space]]s.
2. The category of [[Banach algebras]] is also not algebraic.
3. The category of $C^*$-[[C-star-algebra|algebras]] is algebraic.
