# my position {#myposition}

I have my PhD in theoretical [[physics]]. Have been a postdoc in math and mathematical physics for four years at Hamburg University. Was based for a bit at <a href="http://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/">MPI in Bonn</a> and am now on a postdoc position in [[Ieke Moerdijk]]'s [group](http://www.math.uu.nl/Research/Topology/) in Utrecht. 

# my research {#myresearch}

My research has to a large extent been motivated by thinking about mathematical model building in theoretical physics. With co-editors we are currently producing a book that should give a good overview of modern insights into the abstract nonsense structure of the universe:

* [[schreiber:Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Field and Perturbative String Theory]]

This is the kind of stuff that I am thinking about.

Something like a personal research wiki with more information on my personal research is beginning to develop at

* [my personal web within the nLab](http://ncatlab.org/schreiber/show/HomePage).

More concretely, my **research interest** is in understanding the [[higher geometry|higher]] [[differential geometry|differential geometric]] and [[category theory|categorical]] structures underlying what should be called [[schreiber:differential nonabelian cohomology]]: the theory of [[connection on a bundle|connections]] on [[principal bundle|principal bundles]] and their generalization to [[gerbe]]s and [[principal ∞-bundle]]s. 

* _ingredients_ -- Structurally this involves [[∞-stack]] [[(∞,1)-topos]]es ("[[derived stack]]s") in a [[generalized smooth space|smooth context]] modeled by [[synthetic differential geometry]]. Technically it involves a theory of [[schreiber:∞-Lie theory|∞-Lie theory]] that controls [[schreiber:∞-Lie groupoid]]s and their [[infinitesimal object|infinitesimal]] approximation, [[schreiber:∞-Lie algebroid|∞-Lie algebroid]]s in terms of which one may conceive notions like [[schreiber:Cartan-Ehresmann ∞-connection|Cartan-Ehresmann ∞-connection]]s on [[principal ∞-bundle]]s.

* _applications_ -- Such objects notably model [[gauge theory|higher order gauge field]]s in [[quantum field theory]] and [[string theory]] that have already been a main motivation for the development of [[differential cohomology|generalized abelian differential cohomology]] by Hopkins, Singer, Freed and others. With Hisham Sati and [[Jim Stasheff]] we are working on showing that the fundamental picture involves differential refinements of the full [[(∞,1)-topos]]-theoretic refinement of [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology|abelian cohomology]] to what is called [[nonabelian cohomology]]. 

  * _classical physics_ -- We show for instance that the [[quantum anomaly|anomaly cancellation]] [[Green-Schwarz mechanism]] on which much of the original interest in [[string theory]] is based encodes [[schreiber:twisted differential String- and Fivebrane structures|twisted differential String- and Fivebrane structures]]: [[schreiber:differential nonabelian cohomology|differential]] and [[twisted cohomology|twisted]] refinements of [[string structure]]s in [[nonabelian cohomology]].

  * _quantum physics_ -- A good structural understanding of [[schreiber:Background fields in twisted differential nonabelian cohomology|sigma-model background fields in twisted differential nonabelian cohomology]] should help to understand the systematic [[schreiber:quantization of differential nonabelian cohomology|quantization of differential nonabelian cocycles]] to the corresponding [[sigma-model]] [[FQFT|extended quantum field theories]]. Such a formalization of the [[path integral]] is perhaps one of the central outstanding tasks in the mathematical description of [[quantum field theory]].


# exchange of thoughts {#exchangeofthoughts}

I enjoy exchanging thoughts on topics of interest for my research and always felt it would be a pity not to use the web for that purpose. To satisfy that need I use to 

* discuss on the blog [The n-Category Cafe](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/)

* work on the wiki [The nLab](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HomePage) (this wiki here).

Such research web interaction may still be unusual and has its pitfalls, but does serve a good purpose. Among various highly esteemed discussion partners scattered all over the world, I found at least three of my official collaborators -- [[John Baez]], [[David Roberts]] and [[Jim Stasheff]] -- from such discussion on the web. In each case our first joint article was finished before we ever met in person.

While the [nCafe](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/) blog has proven useful for exchange of thoughts and information, the [nLab](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HomePage) wiki was created with the idea that it would provide a useful space for effective joint technical work. For storing and developing material which is too personal or too tentative for the main $n$Lab I am now using 

* [my personal web within the nLab](http://ncatlab.org/schreiber/show/HomePage). 

This turns out to be also useful for distributed collaborative development and editing. While I seem to have an unusually low barrier (maybe too low) to exposing research material in public, I do also keep a 

* [private personal web within the nLab](http://ncatlab.org/schreiberprivate/show/HomePage)

to which access is password protected. It may happen that some hyperlink that you come across here sends you to this private web. If you feel you do want to follow the link nevertheless, you need to send me an email and try to convince me that I share the password with you, as I do with my collaborators.
