# my position {#myposition}

I have my PhD in theoretical [[physics]]. Have been a postdoc in math and mathematical physics for four years at Hamburg University. Was based for a bit at <a href="http://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/">MPI in Bonn</a> and am now on a postdoc position in [[Ieke Moerdijk]]'s [group](http://www.math.uu.nl/Research/Topology/) in Utrecht. 

# my research {#myresearch}

My research has to a large extent been motivated by thinking about mathematical model building in theoretical physics. With co-editors we are currently producing a book that should give a good sense of modern insights into the general abstract structure of the world:

* [[schreiber:Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Field and Perturbative String Theory]]

This is the kind of stuff that I am thinking about.

A personal [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki) with more information on my research and other activity is
