An ordinary [[pullback]] is a [[limit]] over a [[diagram]] of the form $A \to C \leftarrow B$.  Accordingly, a _2-pulback_ is a [[2-limit]] over such a diagram.


Depending on how weak limits are interpreted in a given context, weak pullbacks specialice to

* [[homotopy pullback]]

* [[lax pullback]]

* [[comma object]].

[[Mike Shulman]]: The sentences preceeding and following this query box are contradictory, given the current content of [[weak limit]].  I would prefer that _weak pullback_ be used in the sense of [[weak limit]], and that the three words below each be used instead of it when appropriate; why not be more precise?

[[Urs Schreiber]]: my fault, I have renamed the entry and the links to it now.
