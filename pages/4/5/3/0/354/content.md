#Idea#

Kan complexes are [[geometric definition of higher category|geometric]]  models for [[infinity-groupoid|infinity-groupoids]] based on the [[geometric shapes for higher structures|shape]] modeled by the [[simplicial category]]  [[simplicial set]].

#Definition#

A _Kan complex_ is a simplicial set with the _property_ that they satiyfy the _Kan condition_, which says that all [[horn|horns]] of the simplicial set _have fillers_.

#Remarks#

* Kan complexes are among the most popular models for $\infty$-groupoids.

* Whatever other definition of [[infinity-groupoid]] one considers, it is expected to map to a Kan complex under the [[nerve]].

* A slight weakening of the Kan condition, the _weak Kan condition_ leads to the definition of [[quasi-category]].

I think a Kan complex is a simplicial set which has the HEP wrt all inclusions of simplicial sets. It is enough to check this for the standard inclusions of horns.


Every nerve of a group is a Kan complex, but not every nerve of a category. For $n \geq 2$, the simplicial set $\Delta^n$ is not a Kan complex.

From MR of Gugenheim: On supercomplexes; if $X, Y$ are semisimplicial complexes, and $A$ a subcomplex of $X$, then $Y^X \to Y^A$ is a fibre map (warning for strange terminology).
