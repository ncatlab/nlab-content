#Idea#

A Kan complex is a [[geometric definition of higher category|geometric model]] of an $\infty$-[[infinity-groupoid|groupoid]] based on the [[geometric shapes for higher structures|shape]] modeled by the [[simplex category]].

#Definition#

A _Kan complex_ is a [[simplicial set]] that satisfies the _Kan condition_, which says that all [[horn|horns]] of the simplicial set have _fillers_.

#Remarks#

* Kan complexes are among the most popular models for $\infty$-groupoids.

* Whatever other definition of [[infinity-groupoid]] one considers, it is expected to map to a Kan complex under the [[nerve]].

* A slight weakening of the Kan condition, the _weak Kan condition_ leads to the definition of [[quasi-category]].
