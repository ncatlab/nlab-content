#Idea#

[[triangulated category|Triangulated categories]] arise as [[homotopy category of an (infinity,1)-category|homotopy categories]] of [[stable (infinity,1)-category|stable (infinity,1)-categories]].

An _enhancement_ of a triangulated category to a
([[pretriangulated dg-category|pretriangulated]]) [[differential graded category]] is a way to retain the information in the [[stable (infinity,1)-category]].

So enhanced triangulated categories are models for [[stable (infinity,1)-category|stable (infinity,1)-categories]] in terms of [[differential graded category|dg-categories]], much like [[simplicially enriched category|simplicial categories]] are models for [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categories]].


#Details#

It is well-known that the concept of a [[triangulated category]] is suffering many deficiencies for the purposes of [[homological algebra]], geometry and topology; and even categorical properties like the non-functoriality of the cones.  For that reason, Bondal and Kapranov in

introduce a notion of dg-enhancement of a triangulated category. 

A **dg-enhancement of a triangulated category** $T$ is a ([[pretriangulated dg-category|pretriangulated]]) [[differential graded category]] $A$ together with an equivalence $H^0(A)\to T$. The triangulated
category $T$ with that structure is called __enhanced__. According to the new results presented in

* Valery Lunts, _Uniqueness of enhancement for a triangulated category_, talk at Workshop on triangulated categories, Swansea, Wales, Dec 10-12, 2008, (report on a joint work with D. Orlov)

* V. A. Lunts, D. O. Orlov, _Uniqueness of enhancement for triangulated categories_, [arXiv:0908.4187](http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.4187).

the triangulated categories of [[quasicoherent sheaf|quasicoherent sheaves]] on quasiprojective varieties and some of their cousins (like categories of perfect complexes on quasiprojective varieties) have essentially unique dg-enhancements. F. Muro has developed an obstruction theory for the existance and measuring non-uniqueness of dg-enhancements in more general setting (unpublished).
