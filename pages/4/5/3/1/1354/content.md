It is well-known that the concept of a [[triangulated category]] is suffering many deficencies for the purposes of [[homological algebra]], geometry and topology. For that reason, Bondal and Kapranov in

introduce a notion of dg-enhancement of a triangulated category. 

A **dg-enhancement of a triangulated category** $T$ is a ([[pretriangulated dg-category|pretriangulated]]) [[differential graded category]] $A$ together with an equivalence $H^0(A)\to T$. The triangulated
category $T$ with that structure is called __enhanced__. According to the new results presented in

* Valery Lunts, Uniqueness of enhancement for a triangulated category, talk at Workshop on triangulated categories, Swansea, Wales, Dec 10-12, 2008, (report on a joint work with D. Orlov)

the triangulated categories of [[quasicoherent sheaf|quasicoherent sheaves]] on quasiprojective varieties and some of their cousins (like categories of perfect complexes on quasiprojective varieties) have essentially unique dg-enhancements.
