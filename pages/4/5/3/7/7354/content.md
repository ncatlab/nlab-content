## Idea

Whatever it is otherwise, [[string theory]] turns out to be an organizational principle that subsumes a wealth of [[effective quantum field theories]] together with hints for their [[UV-completion]]. As such, string theory reveals a multitude of equivalences between superficially very different-looking (classes of) quantum field theories, or between various limits (notably strong/weak coupling limits) of various different-looking quantum field theories. Large classes of these equivalences go by the name of "dualities":

## Examples

The general duality principles in string theory are these:

* **[[T-duality]]**, [[mirror symmetry]]

* **[[S-duality]]**, [[electric-magnetic duality]]

* **[[U-duality]]** .

By applying these, possibly cosecutively, to various corners in the string theory space, one obtains (conjecturally) the following "string-string dualities":

* [[duality between type I and heterotic string theory|I - HET]]

* [[duality between heterotic and type II string theory|HET - II]]

* [[duality between M-theory and heterotic string theory|M - HET]]

* [[duality between M-theory and type IIA superstring theory|M - IIA]].

* [[duality between M-theory on Z2-orbifolds and type IIB string theory on K3-fibrations|M - IIB]]

* [[duality between M-theory and F-theory|M - F]]

* [[duality between F-theory and heterotic string theory|F - HET]]



[[duality in string theory -- contents]]


Then there is also the

* [[AdS/CFT correspondence]].
