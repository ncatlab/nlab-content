Depending what $S$ stands for various things can be called $S$-category. E.g. if $S$ is a category then we talk about categories over $S$, for them see [[overcategory]].

This entry is rather about another notion of $S$-category introduced in 

* [[Tomasz Brzezi≈Ñski]], _Notes on formal smoothness_, *in*: Modules and Comodules (series _Trends in Mathematics_). T Brzezi&#324;ski, JL Gomez Pardo, I Shestakov, PF Smith (eds), Birkh&#228;user, Basel, 2008, pp. 113-124 ([doi](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-7643-8742-6), [arXiv:0710.5527](http://arxiv.org/abs/0710.5527))

which is similar to the notion of $Q$-category of Rosenberg. It is called $S$-category as it is suitable context for a generalization of a [[separable functor]].
