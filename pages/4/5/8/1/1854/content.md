A [[differential graded algebra]] is __semifree__ (or semi-free) if after forgetting the differential is isomorphic as a graded algebra to a tensor (polynomial) algebra of some (super)vector space. 

Roiter's theorem

* A. V. Roiter, _Matrix problems and representations of BOCS's_; in Lec. Notes. Math. 831, 288--324 (1980)

says: semi-free differential graded algebras are in bijective correspondence with [[coring]]s with a [[grouplike element]] (to a coring with a grouplike element one associates its [[Amitsur complex]]). Moreover [[connection for coring|flat connections]] for a semi-free dga are in 1-1-correspondence with the comodules over the corresponding coring with a group-like element.
