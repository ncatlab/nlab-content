A [[differential graded algebra]] is __semifree__ (or semi-free) if after forgetting the differential is isomorphic as a graded algebra to a tensor (polynomial) algebra of some (super)vector space. 

Roiter's theorem

* A. V. Roiter, _Matrix problems and representations of BOCS's_; in Lec. Notes. Math. 831, 288--324 (1980)

says: semi-free differential graded algebras are in bijective correspondence with [[coring]]s with a [[grouplike element]] (to a coring with a grouplike element one associates its [[Amitsur complex]]). Moreover [[connection for coring|flat connections]] for a semi-free dga are in 1-1-correspondence with the comodules over the corresponding coring with a group-like element.

# Relation to Lie $\infty$-algebroids #

One can identify semifree [[differential graded algebra]]s in non-negative degree with Chevalley-Eilenberg algebras of (degreewise finite dimensional) [[Lie infinity-algebroid]]s.

At least when the algebra in degree 0 is of the form $C^\infty(X)$ for some space $X$, which then is the space of objects of the [[Lie infinity-algebroid]]. But if it is a more general algebra in degree 0 one can think of a suitably generalized $L_\infty$-algebroid, for instance with a noncommutative space of objects. This generalizes the step from [[Lie algebroid]]s to Lie-Rinehart pairs.
