## Idea

__Complex analysis__ is the mathematical [[analysis]] of [[complex number|complex]]-valued [[analytic function|analytic]] (typically) functions of a complex variable, of several complex variables, or on a complex [[analytic manifold]].

Since a complex number can be understood as a pair of [[real numbers]], this would naively reduce to analysis of pairs of functions of an even number of real variables; however by complex analysis we mean mathematical analysis which takes into account limits and derivative which do not depend on the real line in a complex plane on which we approach a point. This leads to the notions of [[holomorphic function]], [[meromorphic function]], etc. which are the main subject of complex analysis.  However, there are connections to such real-analytic notions as [[harmonic analysis]], and the geometric approach to complex analysis builds on the theory of [[smooth functions]].
