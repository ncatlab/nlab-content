Jacques Penon is a category theorist who has worked on [[synthetic differential geometry]] and higher categories. He introduecd the concept of a [[quasitopos]] in ([Penon 1973](#Penono73)) and gave a definition of weak n-category that was later proved to be too strict, but this proposal has been updated to take this particular objection into account.
