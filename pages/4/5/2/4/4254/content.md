_Floer homology_ is a common name for several similar frameworks of infinite-dimensional analogues of [[Morse homology]], related to certain elliptic operators. Some of these are related to symplectic or contact geometry and another group is related to aspects of the geometry of 3-manifolds. Most important flavours are the **Floer-Oh homology for action functional** which is important in the study of symplectic manifolds, its version for Lagrangean intersection theory and the instanton Floer homology studied by Andreas Floer and important in the study of 3-manifolds and the mathematics of gauge theories. 

Floer homology for the [[action functional]] is a more systematic approach to the phenomena which were several years before Floer discovered in a historical article of Mikhail Gromov on J-holomorphic curves.
