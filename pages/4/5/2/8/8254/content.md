## Idea

### In homology theory

In [[homology]]/[[homological algebra]], a _chain_ is an element of a _[[chain complex]]_.  

Specifically for the complex computing the [[singular homology]] of a [[topological space]], a _[[singular chain]]_ is a [[formal linear combination]] of [[simplices]] in that space.  

In [[de Rham cohomology]], a _[[de Rham chain]]_ is a [[formal linear combination]] of [[parametrized submanifolds]] [[manifold with boundary|with boundary]].

### In order theory

In [[order theory]], a chain is a [[totally ordered]] [[subset]] of a given [[poset]] (or [[proset]]). See also *[[antichain]]* 

For applications of this concept see for instance 

* [[Zorn's Lemma]] 

* [[shuffle]]
