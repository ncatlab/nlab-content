## Idea

Generally, a _chain_ is an element of a _[[chain complex]]_.  Specifically for the complex computing the [[singular homology]] of a [[topological space]], a _[[singular chain]]_ is a [[formal linear combination]] of [[simplices]] in that space.  In [[de Rham cohomology]], a _[[de Rham chain]]_ is a [[formal linear combination]] of [[parametrized submanifold]]s [[manifold with boundary|with boundary]].

In [[order theory]], the term has another meaning: a [[totally ordered]] [[subset]] of a given [[poset]] (or [[proset]]).  See [[Zorn's Lemma]] for an application of this concept; see also [[antichain]].
