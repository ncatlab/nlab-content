A _metrization theorem_ is a result that gives sufficient conditions, and sometimes necessary and sufficient conditions, for a [[topological space]] to be [[metrisable topological space|metrisable]], i.e. its topology is induced by a metric. 

## Theorems

An optimal metrization theorem, giving a necessary and sufficient, condition is [[Nagata-Smirnov metrization theorem]]:

[[!include Nagata-Smirnov metrization theorem - main theorem]]

A variation of this, directly implied by the fact that [[metrisable spaces have countably locally discrete bases]], is the Bing metrization theorem:

\begin{theorem}
A [[topological space]] $ X $ is [[metrisable topological space|metrisable]] if and only if it is [[regular space|regular]], [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] and has a [[countably locally discrete set of subsets|countably locally discrete]] [[topological base|base]].
\end{theorem}

A historical predecessor and direct implication of these theorems is the [[Urysohn metrization theorem]]:

[[!include Urysohn metrization theorem - main theorem]]

Another variation is the Moore metrization theorem.




## Related questions

A refined and more complicated question is whether or not the topology of a given space is induced by a [[complete space|complete metric]]. In this case the space is called [[topologically complete space|topologically complete]]. A sufficient and neceissary criterion can be given in terms of [[cotopology#Properties|cotopology]].

If one weakens the concept of metric space sufficiently to the notion of [[approach space]], then every topological space is metrisable in this weaker sense.
