## Idea

In [[set theory]], the [[support of a set]] turns the set into a [[subsingleton]]. In [[dependent type theory]], [[propositional truncation]] or the [[bracket type]] is an operation which takes a [[type]] and turns it into a [[h-propositions]], which are the type theoretic equivalent of subsingletons. By the [[relation between type theory and category theory]] and the relation between set theory and [[topos theory]], it should be possible to do the same process and turn an [[object]] of a [[category]] into a [[subterminal object]]. These are the **support objects**, **bracket objects**, or **propositional truncation objects** in category theory. 

## Definition

The support object $[X]$ of an object $X$ in a [[category]] $C$ with a [[terminal object]] $1$ is the [[image]] of the unique morphism $X \to 1$. 

$$X \to [X] \hookrightarrow 1$$

As a result, that all support objects exist is equivalent to the condition that every morphism into the terminal object has an [[image factorization]]. 

## Properties

In any [[well-pointed pretopos]] $\mathcal{E}$, the support is the [[coequalizer]] of the [[product]] projection morphisms $\pi_1:X \times X \to X$ and $\pi_2:X \times X \to X$

$$\array{
    X \times X
    && 
      \stackrel{\overset{\pi_1}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{\pi_2}{\longrightarrow}}
    &&
    X
    \\
    & \searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    && [X]
  }.$$
