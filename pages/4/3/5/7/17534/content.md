## Definition

In [[coarse geometry]], a coarse structure on a set&#160;$X$
is a subset $C\subset P(X\times X)$ that contains the diagonal of&#160;$X$ and is closed under finite
unions, subsets, compositions, and inverses.
(Composition is given by the fiber product over&#160;$X$,
whereas inverses are obtained by permuting the two factors of&#160;$X$.)

The elements of&#160;$C$ are called _entourages_ or _controlled subsets_.
