## Definition

In [[coarse geometry]], a _coarse structure_ on a [[set]]&#160;$X$ is a [[subset]] $C\subset P(X\times X)$ (of the [[power set]] of the [[Cartesian product]] of $X$ with itself)  that contains the [[diagonal]] of&#160;$X$ and is closed under finite [[unions]], subsets, compositions, and inverses. (Here composition is given by the [[fiber product]] over&#160;$X$, whereas inverses are obtained by permuting the two factors of&#160;$X$.)

The elements of&#160;$C$ are called _entourages_ or _controlled subsets_.
