**Under Construction**

#Definition#

A **smooth Lorentzian space** is "something like" a [[partial order|poset]] [[internal category|internal]] to a category of measure spaces.

See also [[causet]].

#Remarks#

* A smooth Lorentzian space is a particular [[generalized smooth space|smooth]] [[directed space]]

#Discussion#

_[[Toby Bartels|Toby]] asked_: How does this relate to a (smooth) Lorentzian manifold? if at all.

_[[Eric Forgy|Eric]] says_: Good question. I took the statement from a comment Urs made [[Discrete Causal Spaces|here]]. I chose to use the word "space" instead of "manifold" simply because it seemed to fit into a theme here about [[generalized smooth space|generalized smooth "spaces"]]. The definition definitely needs fleshing out, but its a start.

_[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]_: 

The point is: there is a theorem 

* see [Wikipedia: causal sets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_sets#cite_note-Malament-0)

that says that a map between two Lorentzian manifolds which preserves the causal structure, i.e. which is a functor of the underlying posets, is automatically a conformal isometry. There is, I think, another related theorem which says that from just the lightcone structure of a Lorentzian manifold, one can reconstruct its Lorentzian metric up to a conformal rescaling.

Both theorems suggest that a Lorentzian metric on a manifold is in a way equivalent to a pair consisting of a measure on the manifold and lightcone structure. The latter in turn can be encoded in a poset structure on the manifold. If true, it would seem to suggest that a good foundational model for relativistic physics _might_ be posets [[internal category|internal to]] [[Meas]].

Somebody should sort this out.

_[[Eric Forgy|Eric]] says_: I like this idea. The measure could be the Leinster measure, which would be neat. We discussed this before at the nCafe I think.

_[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]_: Yes, exactly. There was the idea that, since many finite categories come with a _canonical_ measure on their space (set) of objects, maybe we somehow need to merge this idea of Leinster measure with the idea of modelling a Lorentzain spacetime by something like a poset. Playing around with this observation was the content of [this](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2007/03/canonical_measures_on_configur_1.html) blog entry.  But I am not sure if it works out...
