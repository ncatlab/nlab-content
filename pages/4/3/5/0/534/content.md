#Definition#

A **smooth Lorentzian space** is a [[poset]] [[internal category|internal]] to a category of measure spaces.

#Remarks#

* A smooth Lorentzian space is a particular [[generalized smooth space|smooth]] [[directed space]]

How does this relate to a (smooth) Lorentzian manifold? if at all.

_[[Eric Forgy|Eric]] says_: Good question. I took the statement from a comment Urs made [[Discrete Causal Spaces|here]]. I chose to use the word "space" instead of "manifold" simply because it seemed to fit into a theme here about [[generalized smooth space|generalized smooth "spaces"]]. The definition definitely needs fleshing out, but its a start.

_[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]_ Wait. The statement above is probably not true as stated, even though something similar might be true, if one is careful. In the comment Eric points to I said "_something like_". Not "_is_".

The point is: there is a theorem (which I need to dig out) that says that a map between two Lorentzian manifolds which preserves the causal structure, i.e. which is a functor of the underlying posets, is automatically a conformal isometry. There is, I think, another related theorem which says that from just the lightcone structure of a Lorentzian manifold, one can reconstruct its Lorentzian metric up to a conformal rescaling.

Both theorems suggest that a Lorentian metric on a manifold is in a way equivalent to a pair consisting of a measure on the manifold and lightcone structure. The latter in turn can be encoded in a poset structure on the manifold. 

Somebody should sort this out.
