A continuum is in general something opposite to a discrete. There are several notion in mathematics:

* the continuum is the [[real line]]; consequently the *cardinality of the continuum* is the cardinality of the reals. There is a related **continuum hypothesis** in set theory.

* a **metric continuum** is any compact connected metric space

* ...

In physics, by a continuum one usually means a medium which spreads the physical quantities spatially with some finite density, unlike the physics of a system of particles, where an infinite (delta/function like) density is attached to a discrete system of points.
