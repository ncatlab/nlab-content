## Idea

The concept of _Riemannian orbifolds_ is the joint generalization of the concepts of _[[Riemannian manifolds]]_ and _[[orbifolds]]_:

A Riemannian orbifold is an [[orbifold]] equipped with an orbifold [[atlas]] where each [[chart]] $(\widehat{U}_i, G)$ is equipped with a [[Riemannian metric]] such that the [[action]] of $G$ is by [[isometries]], and such that the transition functions from one chart to the other are isometries.

A key aspect is that the orbifold [[singularities]] behave like carrying singular [[curvature]], notably there are [[flat orbifolds]] (i.e. Riemannian orbifolds with vanishing [[Riemann curvature]] away from the [[singularities]]) whose underlying [[topological spaces]] are [[n-spheres]] (see [below](#FlatCompact2DimensionalOrbifolds)).

## Examples

### Non-compact orbifolds

Basic examples of Riemannian orbifolds are [[conical singularities]] such as [[ADE-singularities]].

### Flat compact 2-dimensional orbifolds
 {#FlatCompact2DimensionalOrbifolds}

The flat [[compact topological space|compact]]  2-dimensional orbifolds may be classified as [[homotopy quotients]] of the [[2-torus]] by [[wallpaper groups]] (for review see e.g. [Guerreiro 09](#Guerreiro09)):

### Flat compact 4-dimensional orbifolds

The orbifold quotient of the [[4-torus]] by the sign [[involution]] on all four canonical [[coordinates]] is the flat compact 4-dimensional orbifold known as the _[[Kummer surface]]_ $T^4 \sslash \mathbb{Z}_2$, a singular [[K3-surface]] (e.g. [Bettiol-Derdzinski-Piccione 18, 5.5](#BettiolDerdzinskiPiccione18))
