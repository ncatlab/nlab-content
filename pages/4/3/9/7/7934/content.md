## Idea

_Infinity_ ($\infty$) is a concept with various interpretations.  The common theme is that $\infty$ is larger than whatever is usual in a given context; the usual stuff being called _finite_ in contrast.  Typically, this means larger than any [[natural number]] (although one sometimes considers infinite [[nonstandard natural numbers]] on the one hand, or considers infinity to be beyond a given class of transfinite [[ordinals]] on the other hand).
