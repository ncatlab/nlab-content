* [[Edward Witten]], 

  _String Theory Dynamics In Various Dimensions_, 

  Nucl.Phys.B443:85-126,1995 

  ([arXiv:hep-th/9503124](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9503124))

on [[M-theory]] and [[duality in string theory]] via consideration of [[BPS states]].

A public talk announcing the conjecture that the [[non-perturbative field theory|strong-coupling limit]] of [[type IIA string theory]] is [[11-dimensional supergravity]] [[KK-compactification|KK-compactified]] on a circle is at 15:12 in

* [[Edward Witten]], talk, 1995(?) ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-O3g6MhLUU))

   19:33: "Ten years ago we had the embarrassment that there were five consistent string theories plus a close cousin, which was 11-dimensional supergravity." (19:40): "I promise you that by the end of the talk we have just one big theory."

The term "M-theory" seems to originate in 

* {#HoravaWitten95} [[Petr Ho?ava]], [[Edward Witten]], _Heterotic and Type I string dynamics from eleven dimensions_, Nucl. Phys. B460 (1996) 506 ([arXiv:hep-th/9510209](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9510209))

as a "non-committed" shorthand for "membrane theory"

> As it has been proposed that the eleven-dimensional theory is a supermembrane theory but there are some reasons to doubt that interpretation,1 we will non-committally call it the M-theory, leaving to the future the relation of M to membranes. ([Ho&#345;ava-Witten 95, p. 2](#HoravaWitten95))

and

which coined the association

> the eleven-dimensional "M-theory" (where M stands for magic, mystery, or membrane, according to taste) ([Witten 95, p. 1](#Witten95))

that later gained much publicity

The term became fully established with surveys including
