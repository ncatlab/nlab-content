## Overview

A [[dependent type|dependently typed]] [[functional programming language]] with applications to [[certified programming]]. It is also  used as a [[proof assistant]]. 

Besides [[Coq]], Agda is one of the languages in which [[homotopy type theory]] has been implemented ([Brunerie](#Brunerie)).
Agda can be compiled to Haskell, Epic or Javascript.

## Cubical Agda
 {#CubicalAgda}

[Cubical Agda](https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language/cubical.html)  is a version of Agda (turned on by the flag `--cubical`) that implements a type theory similar to CCHM (De Morgan) [[cubical type theory]].

Its main difference from CCHM is that instead of an exotype of "cofibrant propositions" it uses the interval itself, replacing cofibrant propositions by statements of the form $r \equiv 1$ for some dimension expression $r$.  This change does not prevent the construction of a model for the theory in De Morgan [[cubical sets]], although it doesn't technically fall under the Orton-Pitts axioms since $I$ is not a subobject of $\Omega$, and no one has checked whether this model can be strengthened to a [[Quillen model category]].

More problematically, to support [[identity types]] a la Swan (which are distinct from both cubical "path types" and Martin-Lof "identity types" -- the latter sometimes called "jdentity types" to emphasize their definition relative to the J-eliminator) the type of cofibrant propositions must support a [[dominance]].  Cubical Agda thus assumes that $I$ supports a dominance, but this is not true in De Morgan cubical sets.  So the semantics of the entirety of Cubical Agda, with Swan identity types, is unclear.  (For this reason, the Cubical Agda library generally avoids using Swan identity types, although Cubical Agda supports them.)

Ordinary Martin-Lof jdentity types should, in principle, also be definable in Cubical Agda as an indexed inductive family, with computational behavior as usual for any inductive types in cubical type theory.  As of March 2021, however, there is a bug in Cubical Agda that prevents jdentity types from computing correctly.
