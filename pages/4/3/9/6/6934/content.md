## Overview

A [[dependent type|dependently typed]] [[functional programming language]] with applications to [[certified programming]]. It is also  used as a [[proof assistant]]. 

Besides [[Coq]], Agda is one of the languages in which [[homotopy type theory]] has been implemented ([Brunerie](#Brunerie)).
Agda can be compiled to Haskell, Epic or Javascript.

## Variants

### Cubical Agda
 {#CubicalAgda}

[Cubical Agda](https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language/cubical.html)  is a mode of Agda (turned on by the flag `--cubical`) that implements a type theory similar to CCHM (De Morgan) [[cubical type theory]], and thus a form of [[homotopy type theory]].

Its main difference from CCHM is that instead of an exotype of "cofibrant propositions" it uses the interval itself, replacing cofibrant propositions by statements of the form $r \equiv 1$ for some dimension expression $r$.  This change does not prevent the construction of a model for the theory in De Morgan [[cubical sets]], although it doesn't technically fall under the Orton-Pitts axioms since $I$ is not a subobject of $\Omega$, and no one has checked whether this model can be strengthened to a [[Quillen model category]].

More problematically, to support [[identity types]] a la Swan (which are distinct from both cubical "path types" and Martin-Lof "identity types" -- the latter sometimes called "jdentity types" to emphasize their definition relative to the J-eliminator) the type of cofibrant propositions must support a [[dominance]].  Cubical Agda thus assumes that $I$ supports a dominance, but this is not true in De Morgan cubical sets.  So the semantics of the entirety of Cubical Agda, with Swan identity types, is unclear.  (For this reason, the Cubical Agda library generally avoids using Swan identity types, although Cubical Agda supports them.)

Ordinary Martin-Löf [[identity types]] should, in principle, also be definable in Cubical Agda as an indexed inductive family, with computational behavior as usual for any inductive types in cubical type theory.  As of March 2021, however, there is a bug in Cubical Agda that prevents jdentity types from computing correctly.

### Guarded Cubical Agda

The guarded cubical variant extends cubical Agda to support [[guarded recursive]] definitions which can be used to formalize [[synthetic guarded domain theory]].

### Agda-flat
  {#AgdaFlat}

`Agda-flat` is a mode of Agda that implements a [[comonad|co-]][[idempotent monad|monadic]] [[modal operator]] $\flat$ ("flat", following the notation used in [[cohesive homotopy type theory]] as introduced in [[schreiber:dcct|dcct]] and type-theorertically developed in [Shulman 15](cohesive+homotopy+type+theory#Shulman15)).  This makes Agda model a [[modal type theory]] and hence a [[modal homotopy type theory]], such as used, for instance, in [[schreiber:thesis Wellen|Wellen 2017]].

See:

* [`Agda-flat` documentation](https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.6.2.2/language/flat.html)

* [installation instructions](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~amp12/agda/internal-universes/code/agda-flat/install.txt)

## Little-known features {#LittleKnownFeatures}

Listed here are some little-known or undocumented features of Agda that are sometimes useful.  Note that undocumented "features" may change without warning; this list is current as of September 2022, Agda v2.6.2.

* There are a lot of useful documented [keybindings](https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.6.2.2/tools/emacs-mode.html#keybindings) that you may not be aware of.
  * This appears not to be documented in the manual (although it is in the Emacs docstring): When in a hole, the commands `C-c C-,` and `C-c C-.` can be prefixed with `C-u C-u` to normalize the type of the hole (and the term, in the second case) before displaying them.

* The manual doesn't document the customizable variables in the Emacs mode.  Of particular note are:
  * `agda-input-user-translations` allows you to add new bindings to the Unicode input mode
  * `agda2-highlight-level`, when set to `interactive`, uses highlighting to display realtime information about which terms  and subterms in the buffer Agda is currently typechecking.
  * `agda2-program-args` allows you to add command-line arguments to be used every time (e.g. the `-v` options below).  This in in addition to the arguments specified by a particular file in the `OPTIONS` line.

  To change the values of these variables, run `M-x customize-variable RET` and enter the variable name, change the value, and then "Set and Save".

* The command `-v` (verbose output) accepts various additional options that are, according to the developers, "documented by their implementation".  These include:
  * `rewriting.rewrite:50` --- displays information about attempted uses of rewrite rules.
  * `rewriting.match:60` --- displays information about attempted matches during rewriting.
  * `import.chase:2` --- when compiling imported files, displays a notification when each file is completed in addition to when it is started.

  Unfortunately, the output produced by these flags appears in the `*Agda debug*` buffer, which is not visible by default, rather than the standard `AgdaInfo` buffer.  To turn these flags on, you can add (for instance) `-v import.chase:2` to `agda2-program-args` via Customization, as above, or to the `OPTIONS` line of a particular file.

## Minimizing bugs

Since Agda has many experimental features under active development, bugs in these features are not uncommon.  When [reporting a bug](https://github.com/agda/agda/issues/new/choose), it is helpful to "minimize" it to make the shortest possible [MRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_reproducible_example).  Some tips for doing this [from the developers](https://github.com/agda/agda/issues/6067#issuecomment-1236313145) include

* Enable `--type-in-type`, `--no-termination-check`, `--no-positivity-check`, `--no-projection-like`, `--no-fast-reduce`
* Disable unused flags
* Remove unused imports
* Copy definitions from imported modules (other than `Agda.Builtin` modules)
* Delete unused definitions
* Turn functions into postulates
* Inline functions
* Remove clauses from definitions
* Replace patterns by `_` if they are not used
* Replace types by Set
* Delete unused arguments to functions or constructors
* Remove dependencies from types
* Replace (sub)terms by `w/e` where `w/e : ∀ {ℓ} {A : Set ℓ} → A` is a postulate
* Make implicit arguments explicit
* Replace wildcards `_` in terms by their solution
