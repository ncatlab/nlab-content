## Idea

There are various different paradigms for the interpretation of 
[[predicate logic]] in [[type theory]].  In "logic-enriched type theory", there is a separate class of "[[propositions]]" from the class of "[[types]]".  But we can also identify propositions with particular types.  In the _[[propositions as types]]_-paradigm, every proposition is a type, and also every type is identified with a proposition (the proposition that it is an [[inhabited type]]).

By contrast, in the paradigm that may be called [[propositions as some types]], every proposition is a type, but not every type is a proposition.  The types which are propositions are generally those which "have at most one inhabitant" --- in [[homotopy type theory]] this is called being of [[h-level 1]] or being a [[homotopy n-type|(-1)-type]].  This paradigm is often used in the [[categorical semantics]] of type theory, such as the [[internal logic]] of various kinds of categories.

Under "propositions as types", all type-theoretic operations represent corresponding logical operations ([[dependent sum]] is the [[existential quantifier]], [[dependent product]] the [[universal quantifier]], and so on).  However, under "propositions as some types", not every such operation preserves the class of propositions; this is particularly the case for [[dependent sum]] and [[disjunction]]([[or]]).  Thus, in order to obtain the correct logical operations, we need to reflect these constructions back into propositions somehow, finding the "underlying proposition", corresponding to the [[truncated|(-1)-truncation]]/[[h-level 1|h-level 1-projection]].  This operation in type theory is called the **bracket type** (when denoted $[A]$); in [[homotopy type theory]] it can be identified with the [[higher inductive type]] $isInhab$.

## Definition
 
### As a higher inductive type
{#AsHigherInductiveType}

In [[dependent type theory]], the propositional truncation of a type $A$ is defined as the [[higher inductive type]] generated by the two constructors

$$\mathrm{isinhab} \colon A \to [A]$$

$$\mathrm{supp} \colon \prod_{x:A} \prod_{y:A} \mathrm{isinhab}(x) =_{[A]} \mathrm{isinhab}(y)$$ 

In any [[dependent type theory]] with [[identity types]], given type $A$, the **support**  of $A$ denoted $supp(A)$ or $isInhab(A)$ or $\tau_{-1} A$ or $\| A \|_{-1}$ or $\| A \|$ or, lastly, $[A]$, is the [[higher inductive type]] defined by the two constructors

$$
  a \colon A \;\vdash \; isinhab(a) \colon supp(A)
$$

$$
  x \colon supp(A) \;,\; y \colon supp(A)
  \;\vdash \;
  inpath(x,y) \colon (x = y)
 \,,
$$

where in the last [[sequent]] on the right we have the [[identity type]]. ([Voevodsky](#Voevodsky), [HoTTLibrary](#HoTTLibrary))

This says that $supp(A)$ is the type which is [[universal property|universal]] with the property that the [[terms]] of $A$ map to it and that any two term of $A$ become [[equivalence in homotopy type theory|equivalent]] in $supp(A)$.

In [[Agda]] [[syntax]] this is

    data isinhab {i : Level} (A : Set i) : Set i where
      inhab : A → isinhab A
      inhab-path : (x y : isinhab A) → x ≡ y

The [[recursion principle]] for $supp(A)$ says that if $B$ is a [[mere proposition]] and we have $f: A \to B$, then there is an induced $g : supp(A) \to B$ such that $g(isinhab(a)) \equiv f(a)$ for all $a:A$. In other words, any mere proposition which follows from (the inhabitedness of) $A$ already follows from $supp(A)$. Thus, $supp(A)$, as a mere proposition, contains no more information than the inhabitedness of $A$.

The [[induction principle]] states that if we have a family of mere propositions $B(x)$ indexed by $x:A$ and we have $f:\prod_{x:A} B(isinhab(x))$, then there is an induced $g:\prod_{z:supp(A)} B(z)$ such that $g(isinhab(a)) \equiv f(a)$ for all $a:A$. 

#### Inference rules

The inference rules for bracket types are as follows:

* Formation rules for bracket types:

$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type}}{\Gamma \vdash [A] \; \mathrm{type}}$$

* Introduction rules for bracket types:

$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type}}{\Gamma, x:A \vdash [x]:[A] \; \mathrm{type}}$$

$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type}}{\Gamma, x:A, y:A \vdash \mathrm{trunc}_A(x, y):[x] =_{[A]} [y] \; \mathrm{type}}$$

* Elimination rules for bracket types:

$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma, x:A \vdash B(x) \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma \vdash p:\prod_{x:A} \prod_{y:B(x)} \prod_{z:B(x)} y =_{B(x)} z \quad \Gamma \vdash f:\prod_{x:A} B([x])}{\Gamma, x:[A] \vdash \mathrm{ind}_{[A]}^{B(-)}(p, f, x):B(x)}$$

* Computation rules for bracket types

$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash A \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma, x:A \vdash B(x) \; \mathrm{type} \quad \Gamma \vdash p:\prod_{x:A} \prod_{y:B(x)} \prod_{z:B(x)} y =_{B(x)} z \quad \Gamma \vdash f:\prod_{x:A} B([x]) \quad \Gamma \vdash a:A}{\Gamma \vdash \mathrm{ind}_{[A]}^{B(-)}(p, f, [a]) \equiv f(a):B([a])}$$

### With a type of all propositions

Suppose the [[dependent type theory]] has a [[univalent]] [[type of all propositions]] $(\mathrm{Prop}, \mathrm{El})$. Then the bracket type of $A$ could be defined as the type

$$[A] \coloneqq \prod_{P:\mathrm{Prop}} (A \to \mathrm{El}(P)) \to \mathrm{El}(P)$$

### As localization

Let $\mathbb{1}$ be the [[unit type]] and let $\mathbb{2}$ be the [[boolean domain]]. The bracket type of a type $A$ is the [[localization of a type at a family of functions|localization]] of $A$ at the unique function $\mathbb{2} \to \mathbb{1}$. 

$$\left[A\right] \coloneqq L_\mathbb{2}(A)$$

By definition, the type of functions $(\mathbb{1} \to \left[A\right]) \to (\mathbb{2} \to \left[A\right])$ is an [[equivalence of types]]. 

This is the special case of the [[n-truncation modality]] as the [[n-truncation modality]] is localization at the unique map from the $(n + 1)$-dimensional sphere type to the unit type, and $\mathbb{2}$ is the zero-dimensional [[sphere type]]. 

For more see at _[[n-truncation modality]]_.

### As a sequential colimit

Let $A * B$ denote the [[join type]] of $A$ and $B$, and let $A^{*(n)}$ be the iterated join type, inductively defined on the natural numbers by $A^{*(0)} \coloneqq \emptyset$ and $A^{*(n + 1)} \coloneqq A^{*(n)} * A$. 

Then the propositional truncation of $A$ is the [[sequential colimit]] of the sequence of functions 

$$A^{*(0)} \overset{\mathrm{inr}}\to A^{*(1)} \overset{\mathrm{inr}}\to A^{*(2)} \overset{\mathrm{inr}}\to \ldots$$

### As a quotient set

Let $A$ be a type and $R(x, y)$ be a binary family of [[contractible types]] indexed by $x:A$ and $y:A$, so that the product projection function for the dependent sum type

$$p_1:\left(\sum_{z:A \times A} R(\pi_1(z), \pi_2(z))\right) \to (A \times A)$$

is an [[equivalence of types]]. Then the propositional truncation of $A$ is the [[quotient set]] $A / R$. (The quotient set in [[dependent type theory]] can be defined using inference rules without propositional truncations.)

### Using functions from the boolean domain

There is another definition of the [[bracket type]] as a [[higher inductive type]] using functions from the boolean domain. The bracket type is generated by the two constructors

$$\mathrm{isinhab} \colon A \to [A]$$

$$\mathrm{supp} \colon \prod_{f:\mathrm{bool} \to [A]} f(\mathrm{false}) =_{[A]} f(\mathrm{true})$$ 

The [[induction principle]] states that if we have a family of mere propositions $B(x)$ indexed by $x:A$ and we have $f:\prod_{x:A} B(\mathrm{isinhab}(x))$, then there is an induced $g:\prod_{z:\mathrm{supp}(A)} B(z)$ such that $g(\mathrm{isinhab}(a)) \equiv f(a)$ for all $a:A$. Here, a mere proposition is defined as a type $A$ for which every function from the [[boolean domain]] is a weakly constant function, or equivalently, that $f:\mathrm{bool} \to A$ satisfies $f(\mathrm{false}) =_A f(\mathrm{true})$. 

$$\mathrm{isProp}(A) \coloneqq \prod_{f:\mathrm{bool} \to A} f(\mathrm{false}) =_A f(\mathrm{true})$$

### Using hubs and spokes

In section 7.3 of the [[HoTT Book]] [UFP13](#UFP13), the authors give another definition of the propositional truncation using the hubs and spokes construction developed in section 6.7. Since the [[boolean domain]] is the zero-[[dimensional]] [[sphere]], the propositional truncation of $A$ is a [[higher inductive type]] generated by 

* A function $[-]:A \to [A]$

* For each function $r:\mathrm{bool} \to A$, a hub point $h(r):A$

* For each function $r:\mathrm{bool} \to A$ and each boolean $x:\mathrm{bool}$, a spoke path $s_r(x):r(x) =_A h(r)$

## Properties

### Weakly constant functions

In [[dependent type theory]], a [[weakly constant function]] from type $A$ to $B$ is a function $f:A \to B$ with a dependent function $p:\prod_{x:A} \prod_{y:A} f(x) =_B f(y)$. 

Given a weakly constant function $f:A \to B$ with $p:\prod_{x:A} \prod_{y:A} f(x) =_B f(y)$, by the recursion principle of bracket types, one has 

$$\mathrm{rec}_{[A]}^B(f, p):[A] \to B$$

such that 

$$\mathrm{rec}_{[A]}^B(f, p)(\mathrm{isinhab}(x)) \equiv f(x):B$$

$$\mathrm{ap}_{\mathrm{rec}_{[A]}^B(f, p)}(\mathrm{supp}(x, y)) \equiv p(x, y):f(x) =_B f(y)$$

In particular, by the judgmental [[congruence rule]] for the introduction rule of [[function types]], every weakly constant function $f:A \to B$ with $p:\prod_{x:A} \prod_{y:A} f(x) =_B f(y)$ factors through $[A]$ by 

$$f \equiv \mathrm{rec}_{[A]}^B(f, p) \circ \mathrm{isinhab}$$

Weakly constant functions can also be regarded directly as functions $[A] \to B$, similar to how paths in $A$ can be regarded as functions $\mathbb{I} \to A$ from the the [[interval type]] rather than the application of said function along the path generator of the interval type. 

### Functions from the interval type

Given a type $A$, there exists a function $A \to A \to \mathbb{I} \to [A]$ defined by

$$\lambda x:A.\lambda y:A.\mathrm{rec}_{\mathbb{I}}([x], [y], \mathrm{supp}(x, y)):A \to A \to \mathbb{I} \to [A]$$

## Semantics

One presentation of the [[internal logic|internal]] [[type theory]] of 
[[regular categories]] consists of [[dependent type theory]] with the [[unit type]], 
[[strong extensional equality types]], strong [[dependent sums]], and bracket types.  (The internal logic of a regular category can alternatively be presented as a [[logic-enriched type theory]].)

The [[semantics]] of bracket types in a [[regular category]] $C$ is as follows.

A [[dependent type]] (a type in [[context]] $X$)

$$x\colon X \vdash A(x) \colon Type$$

is interpreted in $C$ as an arbitrary [[morphism]]


$$
  \array{
    A
    \\  
    \downarrow
    \\
    X
  }
  \,.
$$

The corresponding bracket type

$$ x\colon X \vdash [A(x)] \colon Type $$

is interpreted then as the [[image]]-[[(epi, mono) factorization system|factorization]] 

$$
  \array{
     A &&\to&& [A] & := im(A \to X)
     \\
     & \searrow && \swarrow
     \\
     && X
    \,.
  }
$$

Therefore $[A] \to X$ is a [[monomorphism]], and hence the interpretation of a [[proposition]] about the elements of $X$.
