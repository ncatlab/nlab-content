#Idea#

An $n$-category is a combinatorial model for _directed higher homotopical_ structures: in generalization to how an ordinary category has 1-morphisms going between objects, in an $n$-category there are $k$-morphisms going between $(k-1)$-morphisms for all $1 \leq k \leq n$.

There's a lot more to add here, even if we restrict ourselves to very general texts.  (More specialized stuff should go under more specialized subcategories!)

#Literature#

For a very gentle introduction to higher category theory, try [The Tale of <em>n</em>-Categories](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week73.html#tale), which begins in "week73" of This Week's Finds and goes on from there... keep clicking the links.

For a slightly more formal but still pathetically easy introduction, try:

Tom Leinster has worked on and written about "comparative $\infty$-categoriology" (to [borrow](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/01/comparative_smootheology.html) a term):

* Tom Leinster, _Higher Operads, Higher Categories_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0305049))

Recently $(\infty, 1)$-categories (see [[Homotopy Theory]]) have attracted much attention :
