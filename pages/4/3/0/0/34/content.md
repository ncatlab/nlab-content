#Idea#

An $n$-category is a combinatorial model for _directed higher homotopical_ structures: in generalization to how an ordinary [[category]] has 1-[[morphism]]s going between [[object]]s, in an $n$-category there are $k$-morphisms going between $(k-1)$-morphisms for all $1 \leq k \leq n$.

Models for $\infty$-categories usually fall into two classes:

* in the [[geometric definition of higher category]] an $\infty$-category is a conglomerate of [[geometric shapes for higher structures]] with extra properties;

  * examples are: [[Kan complex]], [[quasi-category]]

* in the [[algebraic definition of higher category]] an $\infty$-category is a conglomerate of [[geometric shapes for higher structures]] with extra structure;

  * examples are: [[bicategory]], [[omega-category]].

## Strict versus weak ##

There are many different definitions of $\infty$-categories, which may differ in particular in the degree to which certain structural identities are required to hold as equations or allowed to hold up to higher morphisms.

* See [[semi-strict infinity-category]].

* See the discussion we are having at [[omega-category]].



#Literature#

For a very gentle introduction to higher category theory, try [The Tale of <em>n</em>-Categories](http://mah.ucr.edu/home/baez/week73.html#tale), which begins in "week73" of This Week's Finds and goes on from there... keep clicking the links.

For a slightly more formal but still pathetically easy introduction, try:

* John Baez, [An Introduction to n-Categories](http://arxiv.org/abs/q-alg/9705009), in
<em>7th Conference on Category Theory and Computer Science</em>, eds.
E. Moggi and G. Rosolini, Springer Lecture Notes in
Computer Science vol. 1290, Springer, Berlin, 1997. 

For a free introductory text on $n$-categories that's <i>full of pictures</i>, try this:

* Eugenia Cheng and Aaron Lauda, [Higher-Dimensional Categories: An Illustrated Guidebook](http://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~elgc2/guidebook/).

Tom Leinster has written about "comparative $\infty$-categoriology" (to [borrow](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/01/comparative_smootheology.html) a term):

* Tom Leinster, _A Survey of Definitions of n-Category_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.CT/0107188))

* Tom Leinster, _Higher Operads, Higher Categories_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0305049))

Recently $(\infty, 1)$-categories (see [[homotopy theory]]) have attracted much attention :

* Jacob Lurie, _Higher Topos Theory_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.CT/0608040))

There's a lot more to add here, even if we restrict ourselves to very general texts.  (More specialized stuff should go under more specialized subcategories!)
