## Idea

Higher category theory studies the generalization of [[∞-groupoid]]s  -- and hence, via the [[homotopy hypothesis]], of [[topological space]]s -- to that of [[directed space]]s and their _combinatorial or algebraic models_ . It is to the theory of [[∞-groupoid]]s as [[category theory]] is to the theory of [[groupoids]] (and hence of [[groups]]).

These [[geometric definition of higher category|combinatorial]] or [[algebraic definition of higher category|algebraic]] models are known as [[n-category|n-categories]] or, when $n \to \infty$, as [[∞-category|∞-categories]] or [[∞-category|∞-categories]], or, in more detail, as [[(n,r)-category|(n,r)-categories]]: 

* the natural number $n$ denotes the maximal dimension of _non-trivial_ cells in the model, 

* while the natural number $r$ denotes the maximal dimension of the _directed_ cells.

So an ordinary [[topological space]] or [[∞-groupoid]] is an [[(∞,0)-category]]: it has cells of arbitrary dimension and all of them are reversible.

In contrast to that, a [[geometric definition of higher category|combinatorial]] or [[algebraic definition of higher category|algebraic]] model for a [[directed space]] in which the 1-dimensional paths may not all be reversible is an [[(∞,1)-category]]: it still has cells of arbitrary dimension, but only those of dimension greater than 1 are guaranteed to be reverible.

Often it is convenient in practice to consider the case where the possible dimension $n$ of non-trivial cells is finite. This is familiar from how a [[topological space]] that happens to have vanishing [[homotopy group]]s in dimension above some $n$ -- a [[homotopy n-type]] -- is modeled by an [[n-groupoid]]. A fully directed version of this is an [[n-category]], which is short for [[(n,n)-category]]: non-trivial cells up to and including dimension $n$, and all of them allowed to be non-reversible. Actually, it is possible to go on to an $(n,n+1)$-category, or $(n+1)$-[[n-poset|poset]]; you can either consider than the $n$-cells are ordered, or else consider that there are irreversible $(n+1)$-cells which are indistinguishable. (Reversible indistinguishable $(n+1)$-cells are all identities and so might as well not exist.)

For low $n$ very explicit [[algebraic definition of higher category|algebraic models]] for $n$-categories are available but in their full generality become quickly rather untractable as $n$ increases: the series starts with [[bicategory]], [[tricategory]] and [[tetracategory]]. While bicategories have found plenty of applications, already the axioms of tricategories are rather involved and their theory mainly serves to produce the statement that there is a good [[semi-strict infinity-category|semi-strictifications]] of tricategories called [[Gray-category|Gray-categories]]. 

Indeed, there are many _strictified_ models for higher categories: combinatorial or algebraic models that sacrifice full generality for a better concrete control. Notably there is a useful combinatorial/algebraic model for [[strict ∞-category|strict ∞-categories]] which, while falling short, already goes a long way towards describing general higher categorical structures. In fact, by [[Simpson's conjecture]] every [[∞-category]] is equivalent to one that looks like a [[strict ∞-category]] except for possibly having weak unit laws.

The challenge of describing fully general [[∞-category|∞-categories]]/[[∞-category|∞-categories]] is to achieve a combinatorial or algebraic control of all the higher composition rules of higher cells. One can distinguish roughly two orthogonal approaches to dealing with the problem:

in the [[algebraic definition of higher category]] an algebraic machinery is set up that allows to concretely handle the explicit _choices_ of composites of cells. Such machinery usually involves [[operad]]ic tools in one way or other. The most sophisticated definitions of this kind are the closely related [[Batanin ∞-category]] and [[Trimble n-category|Trimble ∞-category]].

On the other hand, in the [[geometric definition of higher category]] a combinatorial machinery is set up that allows to guarantee _existence_ of composites of cells. In the [[simplicial model for weak omega-categories|simplicial models for weak ∞-categories]] higher categories are characterized as [[simplicial set]]s with the extra [[stuff, structure, property|property]] that certain composites exist. The issue here is to characterize these existence laws correctly.

The basic example for such "existence laws" is the _Kan-filler condition_ that characterizes simplicial sets that are [[Kan complex]]es, the models for [[(∞,0)-category|(∞,0)-categories]]. More general higher categories are obtained by relaxing the Kan condition in just the right way. For instance by simply restricting the Kan-condition to just a certain sub-set of all cells yields the definition of simplicial sets that are called [[quasi-category|quasi-categories]]. These model [[(∞,1)-category|(∞,1)-categories]].

The right further relaxation of the (weak) Kan filler condition is more involved. An approach to capture this has been given by [[Dominic Verity]]'s definition of simplicial sets that are called [[complicial set]]s and [[weak complicial set]]s.

One expects that every algebraic definition of higher categories admits a construction called a [[nerve]] that maps it to a [[simplicial set]] that would constitute the corresponding geometric model. 

Another approach to handle the geometric definition of higher categories is a recursive one that uses $n$-fold simplicial sets. This is based on the notion of [[complete Segal space]], which is essentially a variation of the concept of [[quasi-category]]. Its advantage is that its definition may be applied recursively to yield the notion of [[n-fold complete Segal space]]s. These model [[(∞,n)-category|(∞,n)-categories]] for finite $n$.

Finally, a large supply of further models exists for [[(∞,1)-category|(∞,1)-categories]] in terms of [[enriched category theory]]. [[simplicial model category|Simplicially enriched model categories]] are a highly-developed toolkit for handling [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presentable (∞,1)-categories]]. [[pretriangulated dg-category|Pretriangulated dg-enriched categories]] and [[A-infinity category|A-∞ categories]] are a comparably highly developed toolkit for handling [[stable (∞,1)-category|stable (∞,1)-categories]].

## Applications of higher category theory 

### extended cobordisms 

One major application of higher category theory and to a large extent a driving force in developing it has been [[FQFT|extended functorial quantum field theory]]. This has recently led to what may become one of the central theorems of higher category theory, the proof of the [[cobordism hypothesis]]. This roughly characterizes the [[(∞,n)-category of cobordisms]] $Bord_n$ as the free [[(∞,n)-category]] with duals on a single generator.

Since it is [thought](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/02/new_hire_at_ucr.html#c016709) that $Bord_n$ for $n = \infty$ is essentially the [[complex cobordism cohomology theory|cobordism spectrum]], this indicates a useful way in which higher category theory subsumes and refines [[stable homotopy theory]].

## Patterns in higher categories

Higher categories with special properties reproduce a multitude of concepts. One finds a [[periodic table]] of higher categories which lists these special cases.


## 1-Categorical aspects of higher category theory 

There are two major _1-categorical_ tools for _implicitly_ handling higher categories: 

* [[homotopy theory]] using [[model category|model categories]] and similar structures;

* [[enriched category theory]] for the case that the category enriched over is itself a model for higher structures, such as [[Top|topological spaces]] or [[simplicial set|simplicial sets]].

The consistent combination of these two is 

* [[homotopy coherent category theory]] or [[enriched homotopy theory]].

There's a lot more to add here, even if we restrict ourselves to very general texts.  (More specialized stuff should go under more specialized subcategories!)
