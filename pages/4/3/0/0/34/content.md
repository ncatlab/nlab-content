For a very gentle introduction to higher category theory, try [The Tale of <em>n</em>-Categories](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week73.html#tale), which begins in "week73" of This Week's Finds and goes on from there... keep clicking the links.

For a slightly more formal but still pathetically easy introduction, try:

<ul>
<li>
John Baez, [An introduction to <em>n</em>-categories](http://arxiv.org/abs/q-alg/9705009), in
<em>7th Conference on Category Theory and Computer Science</em>, eds.
E. Moggi and G. Rosolini, Springer Lecture Notes in
Computer Science vol. 1290, Springer, Berlin, 1997.
</li>
</ul>

There's a lot more to add here, even if we restrict ourselves to very general texts.  (More specialized stuff should go under more specialized subcategories!)
