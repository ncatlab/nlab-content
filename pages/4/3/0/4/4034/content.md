## Idea ##
A Montel space is a [[topological vector space]] such that the [[strong dual]] has a compactness property that infinite dimensional [[normed spaces]] cannot have: The weak and strong topologies coincide.

Important examples are the spaces of [[distributions]].

As a counterexample take an infinite [[Hilbert space]] and a sequence of orthonormal vectors, this will converge to zero in the [[weak topology]] but does not converge in the [[strong topology]]. 

## Abstract ##

## Definition ##
A Montel space is a [[topological vector space]] that is [[Hausdorff]], [[locally convex]], [[barreled]] and where every [[closed]] [[bounded]] subset is [[compact]].

## Properties ##

###### Proposition
The [[strong dual]] $E^'_b$ of a Montel space is a Montel space. Furthermore, on the bounded subsets of $E^'_b$, the strong and weak topologies coincide.

## Examples ##
A normed space is a Montel space iff it is finite dimensional, because only then the closed unit ball is compact.

For an open subset $U \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ the spaces $C^{\infty}(U)$ and $C_0^{\infty}(U)$ are Montel spaces.

[[Montel's theorem]] of classical complex analysis states that the space $\mathcal{O}(U)$ of holomorphic functions on an open set $U \subset \mathbb{C}$ is a Montel space.
