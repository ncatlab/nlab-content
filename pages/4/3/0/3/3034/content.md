A strict Lie 2-algebra is the [[infinitesimal object|infinitesimal]] approximation to a smooth [[strict 2-group]] in generalization of how an ordinary [[Lie algebra]] is the infinitesimal approximation to a [[Lie group]].

It is the special case of a general [[Lie 2-algebra]] for which the Jacobi identity does hold (and not just up to nontrivial isomorphism). Said more generally: a strict Lie 2-algebra is an [[L-∞-algebra]] with generators just in degree 1 and 2 and at most the unary and binary brackets being nontrivial.

In direct analogy to how [[strict 2-group]]s are equivalently encoded in a smooth [[crossed module]] of [[group]]s, a strict Lie 2-algebra is equivalently encoded in a [[differential crossed module]] of ordinary [[Lie algebra]]s.

## Examples 

### Derivation Lie 2-algebra

The Lie version of a smooth [[automorphism 2-group]] is the derivation Lie 2-algebra $Der(\mathfrak{g})$ of an ordinary [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$. This is the one coming from the [[differential crossed module]]
