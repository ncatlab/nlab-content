## Idea

In [[particle physics]] [[phenomenology]] one distinguishes two strategies for constructing [[model (physics)|models]] of a [[theory (physics)|theory]] with desired properties:

* in a "top-down approach" one considers the full [[theory (physics)|theory]] right away and tries to narrow in, in its space of [[model (physics)|models]], to a subspace of models with the desired properties;

* in a "bottom-up approach" one first specifies exactly which properties a [[model (physics)|model]] is supposed to have, and then incrementally uses the remaining wiggle room to see if this specification may be completed to an actual model of the full theory.

This distinction was highlighted, and the terminology established, in ([Aldazabal-Ibáñez-Quevedo-Uranga 00](#AldazabalIbanezQuevedoUranga00)); there in the context of discussion of [[string phenomenology]] and specifically of [[intersecting D-brane models]] in [[type II string theory]]. In fact the article proposes and advertizes the bottom-up-strategy, felt to be in contrast with the, at that time, dominant top-down-strategy going back to ([Candelas-Horowitz-Strominger-Witten 85](#CandelasHorowitzStromingerWitten85)).
