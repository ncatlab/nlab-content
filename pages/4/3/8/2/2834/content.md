## Definition

A **quasifibration** is a morphism that acts like a [[fibration]] in that the actual fibres are, via the canonical inclusions, [[weak homotopy equivalence|weakly homotopy equivalent]] to the [[homotopy fiber|homotopy fibres]] (note that no lifting properties are used in the definition). As a result the [[long exact sequence]] in homotopy for the replacement of the map by a fibration becomes an long exact sequence for the map itself.
