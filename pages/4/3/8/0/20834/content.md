## Idea

What has been called _Witten's dark fantasy_ in [Heckmann-Lawrie-Lin-Zoccarato 19, Section 8](#HeckmannLawrieLinZoccarato19) is an argument, going back to [Witten 95a](#Witten95a), [Witten 95b, Sec. 3](#Witten95b), [Witten 00, p. 7](#Witten00) for the existence of [[non-perturbative effect|non-perturbative]] non-[[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] 4d [[string vacua]]/[[string phenomenology]] with fundamentally _vanishing_ [[cosmological constant]] ("[[dark energy]]").

The original idea was formulated in terms of 3d [[M-theory on 8-manifolds]] decompactified at strong coupling to 4d via [[duality between M-theory and type IIA string theory]] (recall the [[super 2-brane in 4d]]).

Based on the observation of [Vafa 96, Section 4.3](#Vafa96) that the argument should have a natural realization in 4d [[F-theory on Spin(7)-manifolds]] ([[T-duality|T-dual]] to the previous perspective), a detailed construction was finally laid out in [Bonetti-Grimm-Pugh 13](#BonettiGrimmPugh13), [Heckmann-Lawrie-Lin-Zoccarato1 18](#HeckmannLawrieLinZoccarato118), [Heckman-Lawrie-Lin-Sakstein-Zoccarato 19](#HeckmanLawrieLinSaksteinZoccarato19).

## $1/2$-Supersymmetry

The key technical point is the claim that a careful analysis of [[D=4 N=1 supergravity]] obtained after [[KK-compactification]] of  [[F-theory on Spin(7)-manifolds]] [[T-duality|T-dual to]] [[M-theory on Spin(7)-manifolds]] reveals, in contrast to the [[number of supersymmetries|N=1 supersymmetry]] of [[F-theory on CY4-folds]], an "$N= 1/2$ supersymmetry" where 

1. the [[vacuum state]] is [[supersymmetry|supersymnmetric]] and hence has vanishing [[cosmological constant]];

1. but no [[finite number|finite]]-[[energy]]-excitation of the vacuum appears supersymmetrically, 

   hence [[fermions]] and [[bosons]] in the model do _not_ appear in supersymmetric spectra.

## History and phenomenological context

When the idea was proposed in [Witten 95a](#Witten95a), [Witten 95b](#Witten95b), [Witten 00](#Witten00) it was right before observation of [[red shifts]] of [[supernovae]] convinced cosmologists, in 2001, of a relatively small but [[positive number|positive]] [[cosmological constant]]. When this result became enshrined in what is now the [[standard model of cosmology]] the idea of vanishing cosmological constant in [[string theory]] fell out of favor, and a vocal sub-community instead embarked on arguing that [[de Sitter spacetime]]-[[string vacua]] with positive [[cosmological constant]] had to be searched at random in a large [[landscape of string theory vacua]].

However, debate remains that the apparently observed [[cosmological constant]] is but an artefact of the usual [[FRW model]]-cosmologies not taking sizeable backreaction of [[inhomogeneous cosmology|cosmic inhomogeneities]] into account. The situation with this debate currently remains open (see at _[[inhomogeneous cosmology]]_). In the extreme case, if [[inhomogeneous cosmology|cosmic inhomogeneity]], possibly combined with [[higher curvature corrections]] to [[gravity]] (such as control the observationally preferred [[Starobinsky model of cosmic inflation]]), would explain all of the apparently observed [[cosmological constant]], then _Witten's dark fantasy_ would again appear to be viable [[string phenomenology]].
