__Nikolai Durov__  (&#1053;&#1080;&#1082;&#1086;&#1083;&#1072;&#1081; &#1042;&#1072;&#1083;&#1077;&#1088;&#1100;&#1077;&#1074;&#1080;&#1095; &#1044;&#1091;&#1088;&#1086;&#1074;) is a Russian mathematician from St. Petersburg with main current interests in [[arithmetic geometry]], currently employed at Steklov Institute in St. Petersburg ([link](http://www.mathnet.ru/php/person.phtml?&personid=34084&option_lang=eng)).

He obtained his Ph.D. in 2007 in Bonn under [Gerd Faltings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerd_Faltings)) with a thesis [New approach to Arakelov geometry](http://arXiv.org/math/abs/0704.2030), where a complete algebraization of [Arakelov geometry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arakelov_theory) is suggested, as a special case of a generalized [[scheme]] theory based on gluing spectra of commutative [[monad]]s in the category of sets (viewed as [[generalized rings]]) rather than spectra of [[rings]] only. Though the notion of commutativity of a monad had been known to some experts in category theory, Durov introduced them to and used them in an unexpected geometrical context. In the construction of spectra, he first studied a straightfoward genetralization of a [[prime spectrum]] of a ring and then looked at a refinement defined with help of a categorically defined class of localizations which he calls "pseudolocalizations". Later chapters of his Bonn thesis use [[homotopical algebra]] to define derived functors in his nonabelian setup. One of the notions he introduced in this vein is that of [[pseudomodel stacks]]. The final aim of this theory is to present a natural setup in which an arithmetic Riemann--Roch theorem of Gillet--Soul&#233; and of Faltings could be formulated and proved in the vein of the [Grothendieck&#8211;Riemann&#8211;Roch theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grothendieck&#8211;Riemann&#8211;Roch_theorem). The framework of generalized schemes of Durov accomodates also versions of [tropical geometry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_geometry) and absolute geometry or geometry over $F_1$ (a "field of one element"). His version of geometry over $F_1$, while having many advantages, has the problem that the product of the spectrum of integers with itself (over $F_1$) is the spectrum of integers, which is a counterintuitive result (since other expected solutions were suggested).

Durov's mathematical work preceding his study in Bonn includes his work on classical [[Galois theory]] of polynomial equations; it provides essentially the third historically available method to compute algorithmically a Galois group of a given equation. His method is however statistical and some random data are included in input. The algorithm terminates with probability $1$ for all equations iff the [[Riemann hypothesis]] is true. The exposition of these results is in

Nikolai Durov is also an experienced computer programmer. He was a member of a St Petersburg State University student team winning a student [world tournament](http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~agupta/_projects/acm_ibm/acm2001.htm) in programming. His high school education was in Italy. His younger brother [Pavel V. Durov](http://durov.vkontakte.ru) is a professional programmer and main constructor behind [one of the most popular internet sites](http://Vkontakte.ru) in Russia. 

Nikolai Durov is currently working on his habilitation thesis. His earlier publications also include

([math.RT/0604096](http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/math.RT/0604096)).

where in chapters 7--9 Durov presented a flexible theory of functors which can be viewed as representing generalizations of [formal schemes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_scheme) but over an arbitrary ring, and with weaker assumptions. This theory is then applied to a problem in Lie theory and deformation theory; an interesting chapter on symplectic Weyl algebras is included. In chapter 10 an alternative method using [[Hopf algebras]] rather than geometry is presented.
