## Idea ##

In the same vein that [[commutative rings]] are to [[integral domains]] and [[GCD rings]] are to [[GCD domains]], [[reciprocal rings]] are to [[fields]]. 

## Definition ##

Let $F:CRing \to CMon$ be the [[forgetful functor]] from [[CRing]] to [[CMon]]. Given a [[commutative ring]] $R$, let us define the [[cancellative monoid]] $R^\times$ as the cancellative [[submonoid]] of the multiplicative monoid $F(R)$ such that every other cancellative submonoid $S$ of $F(R)$ is a cancellative submonoid of $R^\times$. 

\begin{definition}
A commutative ring $R$ is a **reciprocal ring** if $R^\times$ is an [[abelian group]]. 
\end{definition}
