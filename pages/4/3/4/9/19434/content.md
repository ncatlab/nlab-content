## Idea

The concept of a **Yoneda structure** is an attempt to capture in a general 2-categorical setting  the formal properties of the usual presheaf construction and Yoneda embedding of (locally) [[small category|small categories]]. The thereby arising size issues are absorbed directly into the structure via a class of (locally) "small" maps.

The following is a quote from [[Ross Street|Ross Street's]] "Australian conspectus of higher categories" ([Street 2010](#Street10), p. 241):

>In 1971 Bob Walters and I began work on Yoneda structures on 2-categories $[$[KS1](#KS73)$]$, $[$[StW](#SW78)$]$. The idea was to axiomatize the deeper aspects of categories beyond their merely being algebraic structures. This work centred on the Yoneda embedding $A\to \mathcal{P}A$ of a category $A$ into its presheaf category $\mathcal{P}A =[ A^{op} ,Set]$ . We covered the more general example of categories enriched in a base $\mathcal{V}$ where $\mathcal{P}A = [A^{op} ,\mathcal {V}]$ . Clearly size considerations needed to be taken seriously although a motivating size-free example was preordered sets with $\mathcal{P}A$ the inclusion-ordered set of right order ideals in $A$. Size was just an extra part of the structure. With the advent of elementary topos theory and the stimulation of the work of Anders Kock and Christian Mikkelsen, we showed that the preordered objects in a topos provided a good example. We were happy to realize $[$[KS1](#KS73)$]$ that an elementary topos was precisely a finitely complete category with a _power object_ (that is, a relations classifier). This meant that my work with Walters could be viewed as a higher-dimensional version of topos theory. As usual when raising dimension, what we might mean by a 2-dimensional topos could be many things, several of which could be useful. I looked $[$[St6](#Street74)$]$, $[$[St8](#Street80)$]$ at those special Yoneda structures where $\mathcal{P}A$ classified two-sided discrete fibrations.
