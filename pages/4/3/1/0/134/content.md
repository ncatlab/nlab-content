Regarded as a plain [[category]], $Top$ is the [[category]] whose [[object]]s are [[topological space|topological spaces]] and whose [[morphism]]s are continuous maps.

The [[homotopy category]] of Top with respect to [[weak homotopy equivalence]]s is [[Ho(Top)]]. This is the central object of study in [[homotopy theory]].  Notice that often one may want to use instead a category of [[nice topological space]]s such as [[CW-complex]]es or a [[nice category of spaces]].

More generally, $Top$ may denote the archetypical [[(∞,1)-category]] that is the archetypical [[(∞,1)-topos]].
As such, $Top$ is also the archetypical [[homotopy theory]].

In this incarnation $Top_{nice}$ is equivalent to [[Simp Set]] (in terms of the standard [[model structure on simplicial sets]]) and to [[∞Grpd]].
