## Definition

**Top** denotes the [[category]] whose [[objects]] are [[topological spaces]] and whose [[morphisms]] are [[continuous functions]] between them. Its [[isomorphisms]] are the [[homeomorphisms]]. 

For exposition see _[[Introduction to Topology -- 1|Introduction to point-set topology]]_.

Often one considers (sometimes by default) [[subcategories]] of [[nice topological spaces]] such as [[compactly generated topological spaces]], notably because these are [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]]. There other other [[convenient categories of topological spaces]]. With any one such choice understood, it is often useful to regard it as "the" category of topological spaces.

The [[homotopy category]] of $Top$ given by its [[localization]] at the [[weak homotopy equivalences]] is the [[classical homotopy category]] [[Ho(Top)]]. This is the central object of study in [[homotopy theory]], see also at _[[classical model structure on topological spaces]]_.  The [[simplicial localization]] of [[Top]] at the [[weak homotopy equivalences]] is the archetypical [[(∞,1)-category]], [[equivalence of (infinity,1)-categories|equivalent]] to [[∞Grpd]] (see at _[[homotopy hypothesis]]_).

## Properties



### Universal constructions
 {#UniversalConstructions}

We discuss [[universal constructions]] in [[Top]], such as [[limits]]/[[colimits]], etc. The following definition suggests that universal constructions be seen in the context of $Top$ as a [[topological concrete category]] (see Proposition \ref{topcat} below).

###### Definition
**([[weak topology]] and [[strong topology]])**

Let $\{X_i = (S_i,\tau_i) \in Top\}_{i \in I}$ be a [[class]] of [[topological spaces]], and let $S \in Set$ be a bare [[set]]. Then

* For $\{S \stackrel{f_i}{\to} S_i \}_{i \in I}$ a set of [[functions]] out of $S$, the _[[initial topology]]_ $\tau_{initial}(\{f_i\}_{i \in I})$ is the topology on $S$ with the [[minimum]] collection of [[open subsets]] such that all $f_i \colon (S,\tau_{initial}(\{f_i\}_{i \in I}))\to X_i$ are [[continuous function|continuous]].

* For $\{S_i \stackrel{f_i}{\to} S\}_{i \in I}$ a set of [[functions]] into $S$, the _[[final topology]]_ $\tau_{final}(\{f_i\}_{i \in I})$ is the topology on $S$ with the [[maximum]] collection of [[open subsets]] such that all $f_i \colon X_i \to (S,\tau_{final}(\{f_i\}_{i \in I}))$ are [[continuous function|continuous]].

+-- {: .num_example #TopologicalSubspace}
###### Example

For $X$ a single topological space, and $\iota_S \colon S \hookrightarrow U(X)$ a subset of its underlying set, then the initial topology $\tau_{intial}(\iota_S)$, def. \ref{InitialAndFinalTopologies}, is the [[subspace topology]], making

$$
  \iota_S
  \;\colon\;
  (S, \tau_{initial}(\iota_S))
  \hookrightarrow
  X
$$

a [[topological subspace]] inclusion.

+-- {: .num_prop #DescriptionOfLimitsAndColimitsInTop}
###### Proposition

Let $I$ be a [[small category]] and let $X_\bullet \colon I \longrightarrow Top$ be an $I$-[[diagram]] in [[Top]] (a [[functor]] from $I$ to $Top$), with components denoted $X_i = (S_i, \tau_i)$, where $S_i \in Set$ and $\tau_i$ a topology on $S_i$. Then:

1. The [[limit]] of $X_\bullet$ exists and is given by [[generalized the|the]] topological space whose underlying set is [[generalized the|the]] limit in [[Set]] of the underlying sets in the diagram, and whose topology is the [[initial topology]], def. \ref{InitialAndFinalTopologies}, for the functions $p_i$ which are the limiting [[cone]] components:

   $$
     \array{
       && \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_{i \in I} S_i
       \\
       & {}^{\mathllap{p_i}}\swarrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{p_j}}
       \\
       S_i && \underset{}{\longrightarrow} && S_j
     }
     \,.
   $$

   Hence

   $$
     \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_{i \in I} X_i  
     \simeq
     \left(\underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_{i \in I} S_i,\; \tau_{initial}(\{p_i\}_{i \in I})\right)
   $$

1. The [[colimit]] of $X_\bullet$ exists and is the topological space whose underlying set is the colimit in [[Set]] of the underlying diagram of sets, and whose topology is the [[final topology]], def. \ref{InitialAndFinalTopologies} for the component maps $\iota_i$ of the colimiting [[cocone]]

   $$
     \array{
       S_i && \longrightarrow && S_j
       \\
       & {}_{\mathllap{\iota_i}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\iota_j}}
       \\
       && \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_{i \in I} S_i
     }
     \,.
   $$

   Hence

   $$
     \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_{i \in I} X_i  
     \simeq
     \left(\underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_{i \in I} S_i,\; \tau_{final}(\{\iota_i\}_{i \in I})\right)
   $$

=--

(e.g. [Bourbaki 71, section I.4](#Bourbaki71))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The required [[universal property]] of $\left(\underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_{i \in I} S_i,\; \tau_{initial}(\{p_i\}_{i \in I})\right)$ is immediate: for 

$$
  \array{
    && (S,\tau)
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{f_i}}\swarrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{f_j}} 
    \\
    X_i && \underset{}{\longrightarrow} && X_j
  }
$$

any [[cone]] over the diagram, then by construction there is a unique function of underlying sets $S \longrightarrow \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_{i \in I} S_i$ making the required diagrams commute, and so all that is required is that this unique function is always [[continuous function|continuous]]. But this is precisely what the initial topology ensures.

The case of the colimit is [[formal dual|formally dual]].

For $\{X_i\}_{i \in I}$ a set of topological spaces, their [[coproduct]] $\underset{i \in I}{\sqcup} X_i \in Top$ is their _[[disjoint union]]_.

###### Example

For $S \in Set$, the $S$-indexed [[coproduct]] of the point, $\underset{s \in S}{\coprod}\ast $,  is the set $S$ itself equipped with the [[final topology]], hence is the [[discrete topological space]] on $S$.

###### Example

For $\{X_i\}_{i \in I}$ a set of topological spaces, their [[product]] $\underset{i \in I}{\prod} X_i \in Top$ is the [[Cartesian product]] of the underlying sets equipped with the _[[product topology]]_, also called the _[[Tychonoff product]]_.

In the case that $S$ is a [[finite set]], such as for binary product spaces $X \times Y$, then a [[basis for a topology|sub-basis]] for the product topology is given by the [[Cartesian products]] of the open subsets of (a basis for) each factor space.

###### Example

The [[equalizer]] of two [[continuous functions]] $f, g \colon X \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow} Y$ in $Top$ is the equalizer of the underlying functions of sets 

$$
  eq(f,g)

  S_Y

###### Example

For

$$

two [[continuous functions]] out of the same [[domain]], then the [[colimit]] under this diagram is also called the _[[pushout]]_, denoted

$$
  \array{
     A &\overset{g}{\longrightarrow}& Y
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{g_\ast f}}
     \\
     X &\longrightarrow& X \sqcup_A Y
     \,.
  }
  \,.
$$

(Here $g_\ast f$ is also called the pushout of $f$, or the _[[base change|cobase change]]_ of $f$ along $g$.) If $g$ is an inclusion, one also write $X \cup_f Y$ and calls this the _[[attaching space]]_.

By example \ref{CoequalizerInTop} the [[pushout]]/[[attaching space]] is the [[quotient topological space]]

$$
  X \sqcup_A Y \simeq (X\sqcup Y)/\sim

of the [[disjoint union]] of $X$ and $Y$ subject to the [[equivalence relation]] which identifies a point in $X$ with a point in $Y$ if they have the same pre-image in $A$.

###### Example

As an important special case of example \ref{PushoutInTop},  let 

$$
  i_n \colon S^{n-1}\longrightarrow D^n
$$

be the canonical inclusion of the standard [[n-sphere|(n-1)-sphere]] as the [[boundary]] of the standard [[n-disk]] (both regarded as [[topological spaces]] with their [[subspace topology]] as subspaces of the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$).

+-- {: .num_example #ClosedSubspacesGluing}
###### Example
**([[union]] of two [[open subset|open]] or two [[closed subset|closed]] [[subspaces]] is [[pushout]])**

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]] and let $A,B \subset X$ be [[subspaces]] such that

1. $A,B \subset X$ are both [[open subsets]] or are both [[closed subsets]];

1. they constitute a [[cover]]: $X = A \cup B$

Write $i_A \colon A \to X$ and $i_B \colon B \to X$ for the corresponding inclusion [[continuous functions]]. 

Then the [[commuting square]]

$$
  \array{
     A \cap B &\longrightarrow& A
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i_A}}
     \\
     B &\underset{i_B}{\longrightarrow}& X
  }
$$

is a [[pushout]] square in $Top$ (example \ref{PushoutInTop}).

By the [[universal property]] of the [[pushout]] this means in particular that for $Y$ any [[topological space]] then a function of underlying sets

$$
  f \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Y
$$

is a [[continuous function]] as soon as its two restrictions

$$
  f\vert_A \;\colon\; A \longrightarrow Y
  \phantom{AAAA}
  f\vert_A \;\colon\; B \longrightarrow Y 
$$

are continuous.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Clearly the underlying diagram of underlying [[sets]] is a pushout in [[Set]]. Therefore by prop. \ref{DescriptionOfLimitsAndColimitsInTop} we need to show that the [[topological space|topology]] on $X$ is the [[final topology]] induced by the set of functions $\{i_A, i_B\}$, hence that 
a [[subset]] $S \subset X$ is an [[open subset]] precisely if the [[pre-images]] (restrictions) 

$$
  i_A^{-1}(S) = S \cap A
   \phantom{AAA}
    \text{and}
   \phantom{AAA}
  i_B^{-1}(S) = S \cap B
$$ 

are open subsets of $A$ and $B$, respectively.

Now by definition of the [[subspace topology]], if $S \subset X$ is open, then the intersections $A \cap S \subset A$ and $B \cap S \subset B$ are open in these subspaces.

Conversely, assume that $A \cap S \subset A$ and $B \cap S \subset B$ are open. We need to show that then $S \subset X$ is open.

Consider now first the case that $A;B \subset X$ are both open open. Then by the nature of the [[subspace topology]], that $A \cap S$ is open in $A$ means that there is an open subset $S_A \subset X$ such that $A \cap S = A \cap S_A$. Since the intersection of two open subsets is open, this implies that $A \cap S_A$ and hence $A \cap S$ is open.  Similarly $B \cap S$. Therefore

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    S 
     & = 
    S \cap X 
    \\
    & = S \cap (A \cup B) 
    \\
    & =  (S \cap A) \cup (S \cap B)
  \end{aligned}
$$

is the union of two open subsets and therefore open.

Now consider the case that $A,B \subset X$ are both closed subsets.

Again by the nature of the subspace topology, that $A \cap S \subset A$ and $B \cap S \subset B$ are open means that there exist open subsets $S_A, S_B \subset X$ such that $A \cap S = A \cap S_A$ and $B \cap S = B \cap S_B$. Since $A,B \subset X$ are closed by assumption, this means that $A \setminus S, B \setminus S \subset X$ are still closed, hence that $X \setminus (A \setminus S), X \setminus (B \setminus S) \subset X$ are open.

Now observe that (by [[de Morgan duality]])

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    S 
      & = X \setminus (X \setminus S)
    \\
      & = 
    X \setminus ( (A \cup B) \setminus S )
    \\
      & =
    X \setminus ( (A \setminus S) \cup (B \setminus S) )
    \\
     & =
    (X \setminus (A \setminus S)) \cap (X \setminus (B \setminus S))
    \,.
  \end{aligned}
$$

This exhibits $S$ as the intersection of two open subsets, hence as open.

### Mono-/Epimorphisms
 {#MonoEpiMorphisms}

+-- {: .num_prop #SubspaceInclusionsAreRegularMonos}
###### Proposition
**([[regular monomorphisms]] of [[topological spaces]])**

In the [[category]] [[Top]] of [[topological spaces]], 

1. the [[monomorphisms]] are those [[continuous functions]] which are [[injective functions]];

1. the [[regular monomorphisms]] are the [[topological embeddings]] (i.e. those continuous functions which are [[homeomorphisms]] onto their [[images]] equipped with the [[subspace topology]]).

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof 

Regarding the first statement: An injective continuous function $f \colon X \to Y$ clearly has the cancellation property that defines monomorphisms: for parallel continuous functions $g_1,g_2 \colon Z \to X$, if $f \circ g_1 = f \circ g_2$, then $g_1 = g_2$, because continuous functions are equal precisely if their underlying functions of sets are equal. Conversely, if $f$ has the cancellation property, then testing on points $g_1, g_2 \colon \ast \to X$ gives that $f$ is injective.

Regarding the second statement: from the construction of [[equalizers]] in [[Top]] (example \ref{EqualizerInTop}) we have that these are topological subspace inclusions.

Conversely, let  $i \colon X \to Y$ be a [[topological subspace embedding]]. We need to show that this is the equalizer of some pair of parallel morphisms.

To that end, form the [[cokernel pair]] $(i_1, i_2)$ by taking the [[pushout]] of $i$ against itself (in the category of sets, and using the [[quotient topology]] on a [[disjoint union space]]). By [this prop.](regular+monomorphism#RegEquEff), the equalizer of that pair is the set-theoretic equalizer of that pair of functions endowed with the [[subspace topology]]. Since monomorphisms in [[Set]] are regular, we get the function $i$ back, and again by example \ref{EqualizerInTop}, it gets equipped with the subspace topology. This completes the proof.

### Intersections and quotients

+-- {: .num_lemma #pushout} 
###### Lemma 

The [[pushout]] in [[Top]] of any (closed/open) [[topological subspace]] inclusion $i \colon A \hookrightarrow B$, example \ref{TopologicalSubspace}, along any [[continuous function]] $f \colon A \to C$ is itself an a (closed/open) subspace $j \colon C \hookrightarrow D$. 

=-- 

For proof see [there](subspace+topology#pushout).


### Closed monoidal structure

It is well known that [[Top]] is not [[cartesian closed]] (see for example at [[convenient category of topological spaces]]).

It is however [[closed monoidal category|closed monoidal]].

* The [[tensor product]] $X\otimes Y$ is given by the cartesian product of the underlying spaces, equipped with the _topology of separate continuity_, formed by the sets $U\subseteq X\times Y$ such that 
$$
U_x \;\coloneqq\; \{y\in Y : (x,y\in U)\}
$$
is an open subset of $Y$ and
$$
U_y \;\coloneqq\; \{x\in X : (x,y)\in U\}
$$
is an open subset of $X$.
Equivalently, it is the topology such that for all spaces $Z$, a function $f:X\otimes Y\to Z$ is continuous if and only if: for every $x\in X$ the function $y\mapsto f(x,y)$ is continuous, and for every $y\in Y$, the function $x\mapsto f(x,y)$ is continuous.

* The [[internal hom]] $[X,Y]$ is given by the set of [[continuous functions]] $X\to Y$, together with the topology of pointwise convergence, generated by the (sub-basic) sets
$$
S(x,V) \;\coloneqq\; \{f:X\to Y : f(x)\in V\}
$$
for each $x\in X$ and each open $V\subseteq Y$.
Equivalently, a net $(f_\alpha:X\to Y)$ tends to $f:X\to Y$ if and only if for all $x\in X$, $f_\alpha(x)\to f(x)$ in $Y$.
