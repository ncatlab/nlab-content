## Idea

Schur's lemma is one of the basic facts of [[representation theory]].  

Two related basic facts in [[representation theory]] bear the name of Schur: one general about [[categories of modules]], and another specific to the case of [[complex numbers]]. 

For $G$ a [[group]], and $k$ a [[commutative ring]], a _$G$-module_ (a $k$-[[linear representation]] of $G$) is a $k$-[[module]] with an [[action]] of $G$.

The two statements are

1. A [[homomorphism]] $\phi \;\colon\; V\to W$ between [[irreducible representations]], is either the [[zero morphism]] or an [[isomorphism]]. 

   It follows that the [[endomorphism ring]] of an [[irreducible representation]] is a [[division ring]].

2. In the case that $k$ is an [[algebraically closed field]]; [[endomorphisms]] $\phi \;\colon\; V \to V$ of [[irreducible representations]] are a multiple $\lambda I$ of the [[identity morphism|identity operator]]. 

   In other words, the nontrivial automorphisms of simple modules, _a priori_ possible by (1), are ruled out over algebraically closed fields.  
  
Part (1) is essentially [[category theory|category-theoretic]] and can be generalized in many ways, for example, by replacing the [[group]] $G$ by some $k$-[[associative algebra|algebra]] and taking the representations compatible with the action of $k$; more generally, given an [[abelian category]], the [[endomorphism ring]] of a [[simple object]] is a division ring. 

For (2), if the endomorphism rings of all objects in an [[abelian category]] are [[finite-dimensional vector space|finite-dimensional]] over an [[algebraically closed field]] $k$ (as is the case for group representations), then the endomorphism ring of a simple object is $k$ itself.
