Philippe Malbos is a French mathematician at the Institut Camille Jordan,
Universit&#233; Claude Bernard Lyon1, but actually attached to [[PPS]] in Paris at the moment. He is interested in homological algebra, algebraic semantics and rewriting systems.  In particular he has worked with [[Yves Guiraud]] on finite convergence conditions on rewriting systems.
