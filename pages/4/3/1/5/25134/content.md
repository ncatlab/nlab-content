## Definition

### For series in the real numbers

In [[real analysis]], given a sequence $a:\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ in the [[real numbers]], the series $\sum_{n = 0}^\infty a_n$ is **absolutely convergent** if the [[sequence]] of [[partial sums]] is a [[Cauchy sequence]], and the [[sequence]] of [[partial sums]] of the series $\sum_{n = 0}^\infty \vert a_n \vert$ is also a Cauchy sequence. 

### For series in Banach spaces

In [[functional analysis]], given a sequence $a:\mathbb{N} \to B$ in a [[Banach space]] $B$, the series $\sum_{n = 0}^\infty a_n$ is **absolutely convergent** if the [[sequence]] of [[partial sums]] is a [[Cauchy sequence]] in $B$, and the [[sequence]] of [[partial sums]] of the series $\sum_{n = 0}^\infty \Vert a_n \Vert$ is a Cauchy sequence in the real numbers.
