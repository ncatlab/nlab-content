## Idea

What is known in the literature as _discrete torsion_ are phenomena of [[equivariant cohomology|equivariant]] [[ordinary differential cohomology]], specifically of [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle 2-bundles with connection]] modelling the [[B-field]] in [[string theory]] over [[orbifold]] base spaces.
