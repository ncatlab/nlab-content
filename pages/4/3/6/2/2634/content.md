## Definition

Given a [[Poisson manifold]] $(X, \{-,-\})$ and a [[vector field]] $v \in \Gamma(T X) $ a **Hamiltonian** for $v$ is a function $h_v \in C^\infty(X)$ such that $\{h_v,-\}$ is the [[derivation]] corresponding to $v$.

Conversely, one says that $v$ is the [[Hamiltonian vector field]] of $h_v$.

## In mechanical systems

Given a [[classical mechanical system]] evolving in time, there is a [[symplectic manifold]] (or at least [[Poisson manifold]]) equipped with the [[vector field]] that generates time evolution. Its Hamiltonian is often called _the_ Hamiltonian. This is the concept that Hamilton originally considered and which hence gives the name to the general situaiton.

### In classical mechanics

The simplest, so-called "natural", Hamiltonian (function) of a [[dynamical system]] is the sum of the kinetic and potential energy:
\[ H = T + V. \]

Knowing only $H$ as a function on [[phase space]] (so as a function of [[position]] $q^i$ and [[momentum]] $p_i$), we can derive other quantities as functions on phase space.  In particular, we have:
*  [[velocity]], $v^i = \partial{H}/\partial{p_i}$,
*  [[force]], $f_i = -\partial{H}/\partial{q^i}$.

Setting $v^i = \mathrm{d}q^i/\mathrm{d}t$ and $f_i = \mathrm{d}p_i/\mathrm{d}t$, we derive the [[equations of motion]] in [[Hamiltonian mechanics]].


### In quantum mechanics


The [[quantum mechanics]] of a point [[particle]] in the 
_[[Schr√∂dinger picture]]_ is encoded in a [[Hilbert space]] [[bundle]] $\mathcal{H} \to \mathbb{R}$ [[connection on a bundle|with connection]] $\nabla$ over the real line -- the _worldline_ -- of the particle.

For $t \in \mathbb{R}$ the fiber $\mathcal{H}_t$ is the **space of [[quantum state]]s** of the system, at given parameter time $t$. Since this bundle is necessarily trivializable, we imagine fixing a trivialization $\mathcal{H} \simeq \mathcal{H}_0 \times \mathbb{R}$. Then the flat connection on the bundle is canonically a [[differential form|1-form]] on $\mathbb{R}$ with values in linear [[operator]]s on $\mathbf{H}$.

$$
  A = H \;d t \in \Omega^1(\mathbb{R}, End(\mathcal{H}))
  \,.
$$

The component $H \in End(\mathcal{H})$ of this canonical 1-form is the **Hamilton(ian) operator** (or the *quantum Hamiltonian*) of the system.

Its [[parallel transport]] is the **time evolution** of quantum states. If $H$ is constant as a function on $\mathbb{R}$, this parallel transport assigns to the path $\gamma$ from $t_1$ to $t_2$ in $\mathbb{R}$ the map

$$
  U :
  (t_1 \stackrel{\gamma}{\to} t_2) 
   \mapsto
  (\mathcal{H}_{t_1} 
  \stackrel{exp\left(-\frac{i}{\hbar}H (t_2-t_1)\right)}{\to} \mathcal{H}_{t_2})
  \,.
$$ 

If instead $H$ does depend on $t$ -- called the case of _time-dependent quantum mechanics_ -- then the full formula for parallel transport applies, which is given by the [[path-ordered exponential]]

$$
  U :
  (t_1 \stackrel{\gamma}{\to} t_2) \mapsto
  (\mathcal{H}_{t_1} \stackrel{P exp \left(-\frac{i}{\hbar}\int_{t_1}^{t_2}H  d t\right)}{\to} \mathcal{H}_{t_2})
  \,.
$$

In the physics literature this path-ordered exponential is known as the **[[Dyson formula]]** .

#### Physical meaning and relation to unitary transformations

The [[eigenvalue]]s of the Hamiltonian operator for a closed quantum system are exactly the energy eigenvalues of that system.  Thus the Hamiltonian is interpreted as being an "energy" operator.  Conservation of energy occurs when the Hamiltonian is time-independent.

Transformations and evolutions in standard quantum mechanics are represented via [[unitary operator]]s where a time evolving unitary is related to the Hamiltonian $H$ via

$U(0,t) = $exp$\left(-\frac{i}{\hbar}H t\right),$

provided the Hamiltonian is time-independent.
