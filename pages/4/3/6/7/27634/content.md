## Idea

_Finitely cocomplete $(\infty,1)$-categories_ are the analog in [[(∞,1)-category theory]] of [[finitely cocomplete categories]] in [[category theory]].

###### Definition

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an [[(∞,1)-category]]. This is called a _finitely cocomplete $(\infty,1)$-category_ if  $\mathcal{C}$ has [[finite (∞,1)-colimits]], i.e. 

* if it has an [[initial object in an (∞,1)-category|initial object]] and [[(∞,1)-pushouts]];
* if it has an [[initial object in an (∞,1)-category|initial object]] and for every [[object]] $x \in C$, the [[under-(∞,1)-category]] $C_{/x}$ has finite [[coproducts]].
