## Idea

In [[analytic geometry]], the [[algebra of functions]] on the $n$-dimensional [[polydisc]] is called the _Tate algebra_ $T_n$.

The Tate algebra is a completion of the ring of [[polynomials]] on $n$ [[variables]] under the [[norm]] called the [[Gauss norm]]. Equivalently it is a subalgebra of the ring of [[formal power series]] on those whose [[coefficients]] tend to 0 in a suitable [[limit of a sequence|limit]].
