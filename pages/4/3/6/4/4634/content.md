The [[motive]]s in algebraic geometry can be adapted to derived noncommutative geometry. Such a theory has been developed by Maxim Kontsevich. 

There are also later formal frameworks of Tabuda-Cisinski and of [[Arne Ostvaer]].

In noncommutative geometry a la Connes, Connes and Marcolli have also introduced some motivic ideas.
