Errett Bishop (1928--1983) was responsible for reviving interest in [[constructive mathematics]] as a branch of [[mathematics]].  Before this, he had a career in areas of classical (i.e., non-constructive) [[analysis]], including [[approximation theory]], [[several complex variables]], [[function algebras]], and other fields. 

See [[Bishop's constructive mathematics]] for a detailed discussion of the system he developed.  Bishop\'s important works in constructive mathematics include:
