Errett Bishop (1928--1983) was responsible for reviving interest in [[constructive mathematics]] as a branch of [[mathematics]].  Before this, he had a career in areas of classical (i.e., non-constructive) [[analysis]], including [[approximation theory]], [[several complex variables]], [[function algebras]], and other fields. 

See [[Bishop's constructive mathematics]] for a detailed discussion of the system he developed.  Bishop\'s important works in constructive mathematics include:

* _[[Foundations of Constructive Analysis]]_ (1967), the work which made him famous in the foundations of mathematics circles;

* "Schizophrenia in contemporary mathematics" (1973), a philosophical attack on nonconstructive mathematics;

Volume 2, Issue 4, November 1975, Pages 507-517 ([doi.org/10.1016/0315-0860(75)90113-5](https://doi.org/10.1016/0315-0860(75)90113-5))

* _Constructive Measure Theory_ (1972, with [[Henry Cheng]]), featuring a better [[measure theory]] than in _FCA_;

* _Constructive Analysis_ (1985, with [[Douglas Bridges]]), a revised version of _FCA_, incorporating the measure theory of _CMT_.
