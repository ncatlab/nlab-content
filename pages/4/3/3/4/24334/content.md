## Idea

*Simplicial type theory* is a [[cohesive homotopy type theory]] which is used to represent the internal logic of [[cohesive (infinity,1)-topos|cohesive]] [[locally cartesian closed (infinity,1)-category|locally cartesian closed $(\infty,1)$-categories]] of [[simplicial objects in an (infinity,1)-category|simplicial objects]] in a locally cartesian closed $(\infty,1)$-category. One can think of simplicial type theory as a [[synthetic mathematics|synthetic]] theory of [[simplicial anima]], since the [[cohesive (infinity,1)-topos]] $\mathrm{Ani}^{\Delta^\op}$ of [[simplicial anima]] is the characteristic example of a cohesive locally cartesian closed $(\infty,1)$-category of simplicial objects in a locally cartesian closed $(\infty,1)$-category. 

Simplicial type theory is used to construct various [[geometric shape for higher structures|geometric shapes]] [[internal logic|internally]], such as [[Segal types]] (i.e. [[Segal space]]-types), [[Rezk types]] (i.e. [[Rezk category]]-types), and covariant fibrations. 

## Definition

Simplicial type theory is a [[cohesive homotopy type theory]]: that is, a [[modal type theory]] with a [[sharp modality]], [[flat modality]], and [[shape modality]] [[adjoint triple]]

$$\esh \dashv \flat \dashv \sharp$$

* The [[shape modality]] $\esh A$ represents [[cohesive (infinity,1)-topos#A1ExhibitingCohesion|localization at the simplicial interval]] $L_\mathbb{I}(A)$ for [[simplicial anima]]. 

* The [[flat modality]] $\flat A$ represents the [[global sections]] [[(infinity,1)-functor]] which takes a [[simplicial anima]] and returns its [[core]] discrete [[anima]]. 

* The [[sharp modality]] $\sharp A$ represents the [[complete graph]] [[(infinity,1)-functor]] which takes a [[simplicial anima]] and returns its codiscrete anima, which has the same objects as $A$ but where every [[hom-type]] in $\sharp A$ is [[contractible]]. This is a [[higher inductive-inductive type]] that is generated by a type $\sharp A$, a function $A \to \sharp A$, and a type family $(\mathrm{hom}_{\sharp A}(x, y))_{(x:\sharp A, y:\sharp A)}$ such that each $\mathrm{hom}_{\sharp A}(x, y)$ is [[equivalence of types|equivalent]] to the [[cone type]] $\mathrm{Cone}(\mathrm{hom}_{A}(x, y))$. 

There are also two other modalities

* the [[op modality]] $A^\op$ which reverses all (higher) morphisms in a type. This modality is an [[involution]] on types (i.e. $(A^\op)^\op \simeq A)$), and types have the same core as its opposite $\flat A^\op \simeq \flat A$. The op modality represents the [[opposite simplicial anima]] [[(infinity,1)-functor]]. 

* the [[twisted arrow modality]] $A^\mathrm{tw}$ which represents the [[twisted arrow construction]] [[(infinity,1)-functor]] in [[simplicial anima]]. 

In addition, simplicial type theory comes with a designated [[bounded total order]] $\mathbb{I}$ called a *[[directed interval]]*, such that 

* there is an [[equivalence of types]] $\neg:\mathbb{I}^op \simeq \mathbb{I}$ which swaps $0$ for $1$ and $\max$ for $\min$,

* the [[booleans]] are the global points of $\mathbb{I}$: i.e. the unique endpoints-preserving [[monotonic function]] from the [[type of booleans]] $\mathbb{2}$ to $\mathbb{I}$ is an [[embedding of types]] and the unique endpoints-preserving monotonic function from $\mathbb{2}$ to $\flat \mathbb{I}$ is an [[equivalence of types]],

* the **axiom of simplicial [[axiom of cohesion|cohesion]]**: for all crisp types $A$, the $\flat$-counit $\flat(-):\flat A \to A$ is an [[equivalence of types]] if and only if the function $\mathrm{const}_{A, \mathbb{I}}$ which takes elements of $A$ to constant functions $\mathbb{I} \to A$ is an [[equivalence of types]]. 

* the interval [[cohesive (infinity,1)-topos#A1ExhibitingCohesion|exhibits the cohesion]] of types: the shape modality is equivalent to [[localization of a type|localization]] at $\mathbb{I}$, $\esh A \simeq L_\mathbb{I}(A)$, 

* $n$-cubes detect continuity: for every crisp function $f::A \to B$, $f$ is $\sharp$-modal [[if and only if]] it lifts up against the $\flat$-counit $\flat(-):\flat(\mathrm{Fin}(n) \to \mathbb{I}) \to (\mathrm{Fin}(n) \to \mathbb{I})$ for all crisp natural numbers $n::\mathbb{N}$, where $\mathrm{Fin}(n) \coloneqq \sum_{i:\mathbb{N}} i \lt n$ is the crisp standard [[finite set]] with $n$ elements. 

* $\mathbb{I}$ is [[tiny object|tiny]]: the heterogeneous  [[path space]] [[modality]] $\prod_{i:\mathbb{I}} (-)(i)$ has an [[amazing right adjoint]] $(-)^{1/\mathbb{I}}$. 

* a [[synthetic quasi-coherence]] [[duality]] axiom for $\mathbb{I}$: let $A$ be a finitely presented $\mathbb{I}$-algebra, in the sense that $A$ is a [[distributive lattice]] equivalent to the quotient of $\mathbb{I}[x_1 \ldots x_n]$ by finitely many relations, and let $\mathrm{hom}_{\mathbb{I}\mathrm{Alg}}(A, \mathbb{I})$ be the type of $\mathbb{I}$-algebra homomorphisms. Then the following function is an [[equivalence of types]]

$$\lambda a.\lambda f.f(a):A \to (\mathrm{hom}_{\mathbb{I}\mathrm{Alg}}(A, \mathbb{I}) \to \mathbb{I})$$

### Formalising the directed interval

There are many different ways to formalize the directed interval in simplicial type theory: 

* one could simply postulate in vanilla [[dependent type theory]] via inference rules and axioms a [[bounded total order]], as in [Gratzer, Weinberger, & Buchholtz 2024](#GWB24) and [Gratzer, Weinberger, & Buchholtz 2025](#GWB25). 

* one could use [[two-level type theory]] consisting of a non-fibrant layer, and then axiomatise a [[bounded total order]] in the non-fibrant layer 

* one could use [[type theory with shapes]] consisting of a non-fibrant layer of cubes which is a [[simple type theory]] and a non-fibrant layer of topes which is a [[propositional logic]] over the cube layer, and then define the [[bounded total order]] using the cube and tope layers, as in [Riehl & Shulman 2017](#RiehlShulman17). 

The first approach is simpler to define, while the latter two are easier to work with, since the equalities in the directed interval type are [[judgmental equalities]] rather than [[identifications]], so one doesn't have to deal with [[transport]] hell. 

In the latter two approaches, the [[function type]] $\mathbb{I} \to A$ used in the axiom of cohesion is usually defined as an [[extension type]], while the [[dependent function type]] $\prod_{i:\mathbb{I}} A(i)$ is usually defined as a [[dependent extension type]]. 

## Simplicial anima theory and $(\infty,1)$-category theory

### Morphisms

The [[morphisms]] between elements $x:A$ and $y:A$ in a type $A$ are defined in simplicial type theory as a [[tuple]] consisting of a function $f:\mathbb{I} \to A$ and two identifications $p_0:f(0) = x$ and $p_1:f(1) = y$. The type of morphisms is called a *[[hom-type]]* and is defined as the [[dependent sum type]]

$$\mathrm{hom}_A(x, y) \coloneqq \sum_{f:\mathbb{I} \to A} (f(0) = x) \times (f(1) = y)$$

Given an element $x:A$, the hom-type $\mathrm{hom}_A(x, x)$ has an [[identity morphism]] given by the tuple consisting of the [[constant function]] from $\mathbb{I}$ to $A$ at $x$ and two witnesses that $f(0) = x$ and $f(1) = x$ both derivable from the typal [[computation rules]] for [[function types]]. 

$$\mathrm{id}_A(x) \coloneqq (\lambda t.x, \beta_{\mathbb{I} \to A}^{t.x}(0), \beta_{\mathbb{I} \to A}^{t.x}(1)):\mathrm{hom}_A(x, x)$$

Given a type $A$, the hom-types of $\sharp A$ are contractible for all $x:\sharp A$ and $y:\sharp A$:

$$\prod_{x:\sharp A} \prod_{y:\sharp A} \mathrm{isContr}(\mathrm{hom}_{\sharp A}(x, y))$$

### Functors

Given two types $A$ and $B$, every function $f:A \to B$ induces a function 

$$f_{x, y}:\mathrm{hom}_A(x, y) \to \mathrm{hom}_B(f(x), f(y))$$

by postcomposition which takes a function $h:\mathbb{I} \to A$ to $f \circ h:\mathbb{I} \to B$ and by the [[action on identifications]] which take identifications $p_0:h(0) = x$ to $\mathrm{ap}_f(p_0):f(h(0)) = f(x)$ and $p_1:h(1) = x$ to $\mathrm{ap}_f(p_1):f(h(1)) = f(y)$. 

As a result, functions can also be called *[[functors]]*. A *[[contravariant functor]]* $F$ from type $A$ to type $B$ is a function $F:A^\op \to B$ from the [[opposite type]] of $A$ to $B$. 

### Diagrams

Diagrams in [[simplicial type theory]] can be defined in an arbitrary type, rather than just the [[Segal types]]. Diagrams include: 

* [[composable pair]]

* [[commutative triangle]]

* [[composite]], [[unique composite]]

* [[span]], [[cospan]]

* [[isomorphism in simplicial type theory]]

### Limits and colimits

Limits and colimits in [[simplicial type theory]] can be defined in an arbitrary type, rather than just the [[Segal types]]. 

Limits include:

* [[terminal object in simplicial type theory]]

* [[(infinity,1)-product]]

* [[(infinity,1)-equalizer]]

* [[(infinity,1)-pullback]]

Colimits include:

* [[initial object in simplicial type theory]]

* [[(infinity,1)-coproduct]]

* [[(infinity,1)-coequalizer]]

* [[(infinity,1)-pushout]]

### Types

Types include

* [[simplicially discrete type]]

* [[Segal type]]

* [[Rezk complete type]]

* [[Rezk type]]

* [[skeleton]]

* [[gaunt Segal type]]

* [[finitely complete type]]

* [[finitely cocomplete type]]

### Heterogeneous morphisms and covariant type families

Given a type $A$, elements $x:A$ and $y:A$, a function $f:\mathbb{I} \to A$, [[identifications]] $p_0:f(0) =_A x$ and $p_1:f(1) =_A y$ a type family $x:A \vdash B(x)$, and elements $u:B(x)$ and $v:B(y)$, a *[[heterogeneous morphism]]* is a [[tuple]] consisting of a [[dependent function]] $g:\prod_{i:\mathbb{I}} B(f(i))$ and two [[indexed heterogeneous identifications]] 
$$q_0:g(0) =_{t.B(t)}^{(f(0), x, p_0)} u \; \mathrm{and} \; q_1:g(1) =_{t.B(t)}^{(f(1), y, p_1)} v$$ 
where the type $u =_{t.B(t)}^{(x, y, p)} v$ is the [[indexed heterogeneous identity type]] over the type family $x:A \vdash B(x)$. 

The type of heterogeneous morphisms is called the *[[heterogeneous hom-type]]* and is defined as the [[dependent sum type]] 

$$\mathrm{hhom}_{t.B(t)}(x, y, f, p_0, p_1, u, v) \coloneqq \sum_{g:\prod_{i:\mathbb{I}} B(f(i))} (g(0) =_{t.B(t)}^{(f(0), x, p_0)} u) \times (g(1) =_{t.B(t)}^{(f(1), y, p_1)} v)$$ 

A *[[covariant type family]]* is a [[type family]] $x:A \vdash B(x)$ such that for all elements $x:A$, $y:A$, $f:\mathrm{hom}_A(x, y)$, and $u:B(x)$, [[uniqueness quantifier|there exists a unique]] element $v:B(y)$ with a [[heterogeneous morphism]]

$$\mathrm{isCovariant}(t:A.B(t)) \coloneqq \prod_{x:A} \prod_{y:A} \prod_{f:\mathrm{hom}_A(x, y)} \prod_{u:B(x)} \exists!v:B(y).\mathrm{hhom}_{t.B(t)}(x, y, f, p_0, p_1, u, v)$$

### Amazing covariance and directed univalent universes

A type $A$ is an **amazingly covariant type** if it satisfies the following predicate

$$\mathrm{isACov}(A) \coloneqq \mathrm{isCov}(i:\mathbb{I}.A^\eta \cdot i)^{1 / \mathbb{I}}$$

Let $(U, T)$ be a [[univalent Tarski universe]]. The [[directed univalence|directed univalent]] subuniverse $\mathcal{S} \hookrightarrow U$ is defined as the type of $U$-small amazingly covariant types:

$$\mathcal{S} \coloneqq \sum_{X:U} \mathrm{isACov}(T(X))$$

The directed univalent universe $\mathcal{S}$ is a [[finitely complete type|finitely complete]] and [[finitely cocomplete type|finitely cocomplete]] [[Rezk type]]. 

## Generalizations 

There are many generalizations of simplicial type theory, where the [[directed interval]] is not a [[total order]] and thus the types only represent [[cubical objects in an (infinity,1)-topos|cubical objects in an $(\infty,1)$-topos]] instead of [[simplicial objects in an (infinity,1)-topos|simplicial objects in an $(\infty,1)$-topos]]:

* [Gratzer, Weinberger & Buchholtz 2024](#GWB24) use a [[distributive lattice]] instead of a [[bounded total order]] for the [[directed interval]] in their versions of simplicial type theory called [[triangulated type theory]]. The theory has semantics in [[Dedekind cube category|Dedekind cube]] objects of an $(\infty,1)$-topos. 

* [Pugh & Sterling 2025](#PS25) use a [[01-bounded semilattice]] instead of a [[bounded total order]] for the [[directed interval]] in their version of simplicial type theory for [[synthetic domain theory]]. The synthetic quasi-coherence axiom is not required for the results of this paper, which instead assumes only [[Phoa's principle]] (which is equivalent to quasi-coherence for free finitely generated algebras).

These theories could hypothetically be called *cubical type theories* or *cubical homotopy type theories* for the internal type theory of cubical objects in an $(\infty,1)$-topos in parallel with the name *simplicial type theory* or *simplicial homotopy type theory* for the internal type theory of simplicial objects in an $(\infty,1)$-topos. However, the term *[[cubical type theory]]* is already used for dependent type theories where the [[identity type]] itself is defined as a [[cubical path type]] out of a pre-defined interval.
