In [[mathematics]]:

From [archive.org/details/philosophyoferns033109mbp](https://archive.org/details/philosophyoferns033109mbp):

> Cassirer liked to tell the following story: once he met the great mathematician Hilbert, the "Euclid of our time," and asked him about one of the latter's disciples. Hilbert answered: "He is all right. You know, for a mathematician he did not have enough imagination. But he has become a poet and now he is doing fine.

{#PhysicsTooHard} On [[physics]] (cf. *[[Hilbert's sixth problem]]*), quoted in [Reid 1970 p 126](#Reid70):

> "Physics is much too hard for physicists."

(echoed in Amati/Witten's [quote](Edward+Witten#BeenSaid): "String theory is part of the physics of the twenty-first century that fell by chance into the twentieth century.").
