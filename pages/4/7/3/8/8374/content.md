* the (English translation) of the lecture of David Hilbert at the International Congress of Mathematicians at Paris in 1900 (with the list of  "Hilbert's problems") is [here](http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/hilbert/problems.html)

Lectures by Hilbert on [[physics]] and especially on [[general relativity]] are collected here:

* {#SauerMajer} [[Tilman Sauer]], [[Ulrich Majer]] with  Arne Schirrmacher, Heinz-J&#252;rgen Schmidt (eds.), _David Hilbert's "Lectures on the foundations of physics"_, 1915-1927 : relativity, quantum theory and epistemology, Springer 2009
  
  Around pages 417, 423 there is discussion of "Weltgesetze", roughly what today in  fundamental physical might be called [[theories of everything]], with some remarks comparing to the perspective of [[Hegel]] in the _[[Science of Logic]]_.

* _Naturerkennen und Logik_, Lecture at the _Kongress der Gesellschaft Deutscher Naturforscher und &#196;rtze_, 1930  ([pdf](http://math.sfsu.edu/smith/Documents/HilbertRadio/HilbertRadio.pdf), [audio](http://math.sfsu.edu/smith/Documents/HilbertRadio/HilbertRadio.mp3)),

## Stories

> Cassirer liked to tell the following story: once he met the great mathematician Hilbert, the "Euclid of our time," and asked him about one of the latter's disciples. Hilbert answered: "He is all right. You know, for a mathematician he did not have enough imagination. But he has become a poet and now he is doing fine.
