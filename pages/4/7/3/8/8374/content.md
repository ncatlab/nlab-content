## Selected writings

On the mathematical foundations of [[quantum mechanics]]:

* {#HilbertvonNeumannNordheim} [[David Hilbert]], [[John von Neumann]], [[Lothar W. Nordheim]], *Über die Grundlagen der Quantenmechanik*,  Math. Ann. **98** (1928) 1–30 &lbrack;[doi:10.1007/BF01451579](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01451579)&rbrack;

Lectures by Hilbert on [[physics]] and especially on [[general relativity]] are collected here:

* {#SauerMajer} [[Tilman Sauer]], [[Ulrich Majer]] with  Arne Schirrmacher, Heinz-J&#252;rgen Schmidt (eds.): *David Hilbert's Lectures on the foundations of physics 1915-1927 --- Relativity, Quantum Theory and Epistemology*, Springer (2009) &lbrack;[doi:10.1007/b12915](https://doi.org/10.1007/b12915)&rbrack;
  
  > Around pages 417, 423 there is discussion of "Weltgesetze", roughly what today in  fundamental physical might be called [[theories of everything]], with some remarks comparing to the perspective of [[Hegel]] in the _[[Science of Logic]]_.

## Stories
 {#Stories}

> Cassirer liked to tell the following story: once he met the great mathematician Hilbert, the "Euclid of our time," and asked him about one of the latter's disciples. Hilbert answered: "He is all right. You know, for a mathematician he did not have enough imagination. But he has become a poet and now he is doing fine.
