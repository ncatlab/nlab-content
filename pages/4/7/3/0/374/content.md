A **topological space** is a set $X$ equipped with a set of [[subset]]s of $X$, called **open sets**, which are closed under [[finite intersection]]s and arbitrary [[union]]s.  Since $X$ itself is the intersection of zero subsets, it is open, and since the empty set $\emptyset$ is the union of zero subsets, it is also open.

The morphisms between topological spaces are **continuous maps**: functions $f:X\to Y$ such that the preimage of any open set is open.

More slickly, a topological space may be defined as a relational $\beta$-module; that is, an algebra of the [[monad]] of [[ultrafilter]]s on the category [[Rel]] of sets and [[binary relation]]s.

The definition of topological space was a matter of some debate, especially about 100 years ago. Our definition is due to Bourbaki, so may be called **Bourbaki spaces**. For some purposes, including [[homotopy theory]], it is important to use instead a category of [[nice topological space|nice topological spaces]].  On the other hand, when doing [[topos]] theory or working in [[constructive mathematics]], it is often more appropriate to use [[locale|locales]] than topological spaces.
