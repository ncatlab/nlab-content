A **topological space** is a set $X$ equipped with a set of subsets of $X$, called **open sets**, which are closed under finite intersections and arbitrary unions.  Since $X$ itself is the intersection of zero subsets, it is open, and since the empty set $\emptyset$ is the union of zero subsets, it is also open.

The morphisms between topological spaces are **continuous maps**: functions $f:X\to Y$ such that the preimage of any open set is open.

For some purposes, including [[homotopy theory]], it is important to use instead a category of [[nice topological space|nice topological spaces]].  On the other hand, when doing [[topos]] theory or working in [[constructive mathematics]], it is often more appropriate to use [[locale|locales]] than topological spaces.
