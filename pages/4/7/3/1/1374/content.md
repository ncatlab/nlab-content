#Definition#

In the context of [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categories]] a [[spectrum]] is a [[spectrum object]] in the [[(infinity,1)-category]] $Top_*$ of pointed [[topological space]]s.

Recall that [[spectrum object]]s in the [[(infinity,1)-category]] $C$ form a [[stable (infinity,1)-category]] $Sp(C)$.

The [[stable (infinity,1)-category]] of [[spectrum object]]s in $Top_*$ is the **stable $(\infty,1)$-category of spectra**

$$
  Stab(Top) := Sp(Top_*)
  \,.
$$

#Remarks#

* With the [[smash product of spectra]] $Sp(Top_*)$ becomes a [[symmetric monoidal (infinity,1)-category]].

  * an [[algebra in an (infinity,1)-category|algebra object]] in $Sp(Top_*)$ with respect to this monoidal structure is an [[associative ring spectrum]];

  * an [[commutative algebra in an (infinity,1)-category|algebra object]] in $Sp(Top_*)$ with respect to this monoidal structure is a [[commutative ring spectrum]];
