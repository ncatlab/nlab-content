__Weil reciprocity__ is a theorem of [[Andr√© Weil]] about the [[function field]] $K(C)$ of an [[algebraic curve]] $C$ over an algebraically closed field $K$.

The following two articles make parallel between some notions of [[QFT]] and of number theory and in particular about the analogy between the Weil reciprocity law for [[function field]]s and the [[Takahashi-Ward identities]] of [[quantum field theory]]:
