(This entry describes two distinct notions, one in the theory of [[inner product spaces]], and the second in a more purely [[category theory|category theoretic]] context.)

## In inner product spaces

Two elements $x,y$ in an [[inner product space]], $(V, \langle -,-\rangle)$, are **orthogonal** or [[normal vectors]], denoted $x \perp y,$ if $\langle x,y\rangle = 0$.

## In category theory

### Definition 

Two [[morphism]]s $e:A\to B$ and $m:C\to D$ in a [[category]] are said to be **orthogonal**, written $e\perp m$, if $e$ has the [[left lifting property]] with respect to $m$, i.e. if in any [[commutative diagram|commutative square]]

$$
\array{ A & \overset{e}{\to} & B\\
  \downarrow && \downarrow \\
  C & \underset{m}{\to} & D}
$$

there exists a unique diagonal [[filler]] making both triangles commute:

$$
\array{ A & \overset{e}{\to} & B\\
  \downarrow & \swarrow & \downarrow \\
  C & \underset{m}{\to} & D}
$$

Given a [[class]] of maps $E$, the class $\{m | e\perp m \;\forall e\in E\}$ is denoted $E^{\downarrow}$ or $E^\perp$.  Likewise, given $M$, the class $\{e | e\perp m \;\forall m\in M\}$ is denoted $M^{\uparrow}$ or ${}^\perp M$.  These operations form a [[Galois connection]] on the poset of classes of morphisms in the ambient category.  In particular, we have $({}^\perp(E^\perp))^\perp = E^\perp$ and ${}^\perp(({}^\perp M)^\perp) = {}^\perp M$.

A pair $(E,M)$ such that $E^\perp = M$ and $E = {}^\perp M$ is sometimes called a **prefactorization system**.  If in addition every morphism factors as an $E$-morphism followed by an $M$-morphism, it is an (orthogonal) [[orthogonal factorization system|factorization system]].

### Orthogonality of morphisms to objects

A [[morphism]] $e:A\to B$ is said to be (left) **orthogonal** to an object $C$, written $e\perp C$ (equivalently : $C$ is right orthgonal to $e$), if for any morphism $A \to C$

$$
  \array{ 
    A & \overset{e}{\to} & B
    \\
    \downarrow && 
    \\
    C 
  }
$$

there exists a unique morphism $B \to C$ making the following diagram commute:

$$
\array{ 
  A & \overset{e}{\to} & B
  \\
  \downarrow & \swarrow & 
  \\
  C 
  \mathrlap{\,.}  
  }
$$

If the category we are working with has a terminal object $1$, this is equivalent to saying that $e \perp !$ where $! : C \to 1$ is the unique morphism to the terminal object. Abusing notation, we often write $E^\perp$ for the collection of objects $C$ which are right orthogonal to each morphism in $E$. We sometimes refer to $E^\perp$ as the (right) **orthogonal complement** of $E$.

### Examples 

* Of course, any [[orthogonal factorization system]] gives plenty of examples.  The ur-example is that $e\perp m$ in [[Set]] (or actually, any [[pretopos]]) for any surjection $e$ and injection $m$.

* A [[strong epimorphism]] in any category is, by definition, an epimorphism in ${}^\perp(Mono)$, where $Mono$ is the class of monomorphisms.  (If the category has equalizers, then every map in ${}^\perp(Mono)$ is epic.)  Dually, a [[strong monomorphism]] is a monomorphism in $(Epi)^\perp$.

* If $\mathcal{C}$ is a category, interesting full subcategories $\mathcal{D} \subseteq \mathcal{C}$ are often usefully characterized as the orthogonal complement of some collection of morphisms. In fact, if $\mathcal{D}$ is a [[reflective subcategory]] of $\mathcal{C}$, then we always have $\mathcal{D} = E_\ast^\perp$ where $E_\ast = \{ C \xrightarrow{\eta_C} iL C \mid C \in \mathcal{C}\}$ (where we write $i : D \to C$ for the inclusion, $L$ for the left adjoint, and $\eta : 1_{\mathcal{C}} \to iL$ for the unit of the adjunction), but typically we already have $\mathcal{D} = E^\perp$ for some much smaller collection $E \subseteq E_\ast$. It is often convenient to think about $\mathcal{D}$ in this way for some such well-chosen set $E$.

* Conversely, the [[orthogonal subcategory problem]] for a [[class]] of [[morphism]]s $\Sigma$ in a [[category]] $C$ asks whether the [[full subcategory]] $\Sigma^\perp$ of [[object]]s $X$ [[orthogonal]] to $\Sigma$ is a [[reflective subcategory]]. Here we define $f \perp X$ to mean $f \perp !: X \to 1$

  The orthogonal subcategory problem is related to [[localization]]. Suppose $\Sigma^\perp$ is indeed a [[reflective subcategory]]; let $r: C \to \Sigma^\perp$ be the reflector (the [[left adjoint]] to the inclusion $i: \Sigma^\perp \to C$). Certainly $r$ sends arrows in $\Sigma$ to isomorphisms in $\Sigma^\perp$. Indeed, if $f: A \to B$ belongs to $\Sigma$, then the inverse to $r(f): r(A) \to r(B)$ is the unique arrow extending $1_{r(A)}$ along $r(f): r(A) \to r(B)$ to an arrow $g: r(B) \to r(A)$, using the fact that $r(A)$ belongs to $\Sigma^\perp$.
