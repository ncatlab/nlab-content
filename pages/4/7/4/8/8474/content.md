## Definition

A **$\Pi W$-pretopos** is a [[Π-pretopos]] with all [[W-types]].

## Examples
 {#Examples}

* In [[homotopy type theory]] the [[h-sets]] form a &#928;W-pretopos ([Rijke-Spitter 13](#RijkeSpitter13)). See also at _[[structural set theory]]_.

## Related concepts

* A [[predicative topos]] is a $\Pi W$-pretopos satisfying the [[axiom of multiple choice]].



## References

That the [[h-sets]] in [[homotopy type theory]] form a &#928;W-pretopos is discussed in
