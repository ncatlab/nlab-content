On [[flavour physics]] and [[flavour anomalies]] seen at the [[LHCb experiment]]:

* [[Niels Tuning]], _Recent results from LHCb_, Nikhef 2020 ([nikhef event:2253](https://indico.nikhef.nl/event/2253), [pdf](https://indico.nikhef.nl/event/2253/material/slides/0.pdf), [[TuningFlavourAnomaly20.pdf:file]])

  > In recent years a number of results in flavour physics have drawn some attention due to tensions with respect to Standard Model predictions. An overview of these results will be shown, together with a few recent results from this Spring, both on the flavour anomalies and 'classical' flavour physics
