__Vitalik Buterin__ is the principal founder of [[zoranskoda:Ethereum]] [[blockchain]]. He was considering the limitations of [[zoranskoda:bitcoin|Bitcoin]] blockchain, where new functionalities were added one by one and came up with the idea of developing a new blockchain with Turing complete runtime for [[smart contract]]s on blockchain, enabling also the development of distributed applications, turning the blockchain into a computer-like platform where new applications could easily be added. Buterin is considered as a prodigy who founded Ethereum at age of 19 and now considered as one of main gurus of blockchain technology. He is one of the authors of the Plasma algorithm for layer 2 network over Ethereum-like blockchains and promotes the Casper proof of stake protocol for Ethereum 2.0.

Other leading figures behind early Ethereum network include Charles Hoskinson and Gavin Wood. Hoskinson is now behind the [[zoranskoda:Cardano]] project, leading company IOHK, and also contributing to [polymath](https://polymath.network) blockchain for financial securities. Gavin Wood introduced Solidity, the major higher level language for smart contracts which compiles to Ethereum [[virtual machine]] bytecode, in August 2014. He is now leading the web 3.0 project and Parity Technologies which is behind Parity client for Ethereum, Polkadot and Substrate projects.
