## Idea

### For directed spaces

In generalization to how a [[topological space]] $X$ has a [[fundamental groupoid]] whose [[morphism]]s are [[homotopy]]-classes of paths in $X$ and whose composition operation is the concatenation of paths, a [[directed space]] has a **fundamental category** whose morphisms are _directed_ paths in $X$.

### For stratified spaces

A [[stratified space]] has a 'fundamental $n$-category with duals', which  generalizes the [[fundamental groupoid|fundamental n-groupoid]] of a plain old space.  When a path crosses a codimension-$1$ stratum, "something interesting happens" &#8211; i.e., a catastrophe.   So, we say such a path gives a noninvertible morphism.   The idea is that going along such a path and then going back is not "the same" as having stayed put. So, going back along such a path is not its inverse, just its [[dual morphism|dual]].
