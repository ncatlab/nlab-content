A [[directed space]] has a 'fundamental $n$-category'. (See [Grandis](http://www.dima.unige.it/~grandis/DAT.Intro.pdf).)

A [[stratified space]] has a 'fundamental $n$-category with duals', which  generalizes the [[fundamental groupoid|fundamental n-groupoid]] of a plain old space.  When a path crosses a codimension-$1$ stratum, "something interesting happens" &#8211; i.e., a catastrophe.   So, we say such a path gives a noninvertible morphism.   The idea is that going along such a path and then going back is not "the same" as having stayed put. So, going back along such a path is not its inverse, just its [[dual morphism|dual]].
