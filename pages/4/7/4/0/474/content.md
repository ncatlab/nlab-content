## Idea

### For directed spaces

In generalization to how a [[topological space]] $X$ has a [[fundamental groupoid]] whose [[morphism]]s are [[homotopy]]-classes of paths in $X$ and whose composition operation is the concatenation of paths, a [[directed space]] has a **fundamental category** whose morphisms are _directed_ paths in $X$.

### For stratified spaces

A [[stratified space]] has a 'fundamental [[(infinity,n)-category with duals|n-category with duals]]', which  generalizes the [[fundamental groupoid|fundamental n-groupoid]] of a plain old space.  When a path crosses a codimension-$1$ stratum, "something interesting happens" &#8211; i.e., a catastrophe.   So, we say such a path gives a noninvertible morphism.   The idea is that going along such a path and then going back is not "the same" as having stayed put. So, going back along such a path is not its inverse, just its [[dualizable object|dual]].

See Caf&#233; [discussion] (http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2006/11/this_weeks_finds_in_mathematic_2.html#c006196) and paper it inspired, J. Woolf [Transversal homotopy theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.3322).
