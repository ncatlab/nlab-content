A directed space has a 'fundamental $n$-category'. (See [Grandis](http://www.dima.unige.it/~grandis/DAT.Intro.pdf).)

A stratified space has a 'fundamental $n$-category with duals', which  generalizes the fundamental $n$-groupoid of a plain old space.  When a path crosses a codimension 1 stratum, "something interesting happens" - i.e., a catastrophe.   So, we say such a path gives a noninvertible morphism.   The idea is that going along such a path and then going back is not "the same" as having stayed put. So, going back along such a path is not its inverse, just its dual.
