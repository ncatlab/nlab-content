## Definitions

A $C^*$-algebra is a complex [[Banach algebra]] over the [[complex numbers]] with an [[involution]] compatible with [[complex conjugation]] (that is a Banach $*$-[[star-algebra|algebra]]) that satisfies the $C^*$-identity
$$ {\|{A^* A}\|} = {\|{A^*}\|} {\|{A}\|} $$
or equivalently the $B^*$-identity
$$ {\|{A^* A}\|} = {\|{A}\|^2} .$$

There are different concepts for the [[tensor product]] of $C^*-algebras$, see for example [[spatial tensor product]].


### Concrete $C^*$-algebras

Given a [[Hilbert space]] $H$, a __concrete $C^*$-algebra__ in $H$ is a $*$-[[subalgebra]] of the algebra of [[bounded operators]] on $H$ that is [[closed subspace|closed]] in the [[norm topology]].  

Similarly, a __[[representation of a C-star algebra|representation]]__ of a $C^*$-algebra $A$ on a [[Hilbert space]] $H$ is a $*$-homomorphism from $A$ to the algebra of [[bounded operators]] on $H$.

It is immediate that concrete $C^*$-algebras correspond precisely to [[faithful representation]]s of abstract $C^*$-algebras.  It is an important theorem that *every* $C^*$-algebra has a faithful representation; that is, every abstract $C^*$-algebra is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to a concrete $C^*$-algebra.

The original definition of the term '$C^*$-algebra' was in fact the concrete notion; the 'C' stood for 'closed'.  Furthermore, the original term for the abstract notion was '$B^*$-algebra'.  However, we now usually interpret '$C^*$-algebra' abstractly.  (Compare '$W^*$-algebra' and '[[von Neumann algebra]]'.)


### In $\dagger$-compact categories {#DaggerFormulation}

The notion of $C^*$-algebra can be abstracted to the general context of [[symmetric monoidal †-categories]], which serves to illuminate their role in [[quantum mechanics in terms of †-compact categories]].

For a discussion of this in the finite-dimensional case see

## Properties

The [[GNS construction]]) shows how to interpret every abstract $C^*$-algebra as a concrete $C^*$-algebra.
