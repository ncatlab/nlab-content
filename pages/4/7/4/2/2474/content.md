A $C^*$-algebra is a complex [[Banach algebra]] over the [[complex numbers]] with an involution compatible with complex conjugation (that is a Banach $*$-[[star-algebra|algebra]]) and such that the $C^*$-identity holds:

$$\| A^* A \| = \|A\|^2. $$

Every $C^*$-algebra can be realized (via the [[GNS construction]]) as a norm-closed $*$-subalgebra of the Banach $*$-algebra $B(H)=L(H,H)$ of bounded linear operators on a [[Hilbert space]] $H$ with the induced norm.

See [[operator algebras]].
