A $C^*$-algebra is a complex [[Banach algebra]] with an involution compatible with complex conjugation (=$*$-algebra) and such that the $C^*$-identity holds:

$$\| A^* A \| = \|A\|^2 $$

Every $C^*$-algebra can be realized (via GNS construction) as the norm closed $*$-subalgebra of the Banach $*$-algebra $B(H)=L(H,H)$ of bounded linear operators on a separable [[Hilbert space]] $H$ with the induced norm.
