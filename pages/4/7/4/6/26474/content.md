There are multiple notions of **strict partial order** used in mathematics:

* an [[asymmetric relation|asymmetric]] [[strict preorder]], which are just [[strict preorders]]

* a [[weakly linear relation|weakly linear]] [[strict preorder]], which are [[strict weak orders]]

A **strict poset**, is a [[set]] equipped with a strict partial order.
