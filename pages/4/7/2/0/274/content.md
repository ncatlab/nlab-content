A __Segal category__ is a [[simplicial space]] $X$ such that $X_0$ (the set of points) is a discrete [[simplicial set]] such that the [[Segal map]]
$$ \phi_k: X_k \to X_1 \times_{X_0} \cdots \times_{X_0} X_1 $$
(induced by $X(\alpha_i): X_k \to X_1$) assigned to $X$ is a [[weak equivalence]] of simplicial sets for $k \geq 2$.

A Segal category is a weak form of [[S-category|S-categories]], in which composition is only defined up to a coherent system of [[equivalence]]s.

Segal categories were defined in 1974 (implicitly) by [[Graeme Segal]]. They were named Segal categories first by William Dwyer--[[Daniel Kan]]--Jeffrey Smith in 1989. In their famous book _Homotopy invariant algebraic structures on topological spaces_, John Boardman and Rainer Vogt used [[quasi-category|quasi-categories]]; a quasi-category is a simplicial set satisfying the weak Kan condition, so quasi-categories are also called [[weak Kan complex]]es. All of these are [[Quillen equivalence|Quillen equivalent]] models of $(\infty,1)$-[[(infinity,1)-category|categories]].
