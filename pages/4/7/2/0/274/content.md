Toen: Homotopical and higher categorical structures in algebraic geometry. File Toen web unpubl hab.pdf. Treats  general philosophical background, various forms of homotopy theories, Segal categories, Waldhausen Kth briefly, Hochshild cohomology of Segal categories and of model cats, S-cats, Segal topoi, Tannakian duality for Segal cats, and schematic homotopy types. Also letter to May about n-cats.

Toen: Segal topoi and stacks over Segal categories. File Toen web prepr msri.pdf. Analogous and in some sense equivalent to the notion of model topos, but some advantages. Includes a Giraud type statement characterizing Segal topoi among Segal cats. Notion of homotopy type of a Segal site, improving on the etale homotopy theory of schemes, and more generally on the theory of homotopy types of sites as defined by Artin and Mazur.

Toen: Higher and derived stacks, a global overview. File web publ seatt.pdf. Also contains an intro to Segal cats, and some material on schematic homotopy types.

A quote from somewhere: "K-theory is an invariant of Segal cats but not of triangulated categories". Can also define Hochschild cohomology of Segal cats (and of model cats!): it is the simplicial set $R\underline{End}(id_A)$
