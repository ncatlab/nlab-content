## Idea

The _Witten geneus_ is a [[genus]] for [[string structure]]-[[cobordism]]s with values in [[topological modular form]]s.

The universal [[elliptic genus|elliptic]] [[genus]] is a morphism $\phi_2 : \Omega_\bullet^{SO} \otimes \mathbb{C} \to M_\bullet(\Gamma_1(2)) \simeq \mathbb{C}[\delta, \epsilon]$ from the complexified [[cobordism ring]].
[[Edward Witten]] argued that the value of the elliptic genus on $X$ can be understood as the $S^1$-[[equivariant cohomology|equivariant]] [[index]] of a [[Dirac operator]] on a [[loop space]] $\mathcal{L} X$.

As such it can be understood as the [[partition function]] of a an $N=1$ $d=2$ super[[CFT]] (the "[[heterotic string]]"). Formalizations of this construction exist both in [[AQFT]]-type and in [[FQFT]]-type [[quantum field theory]]:

* [[Stephan Stolz]] and [[Peter Teichner]] have proposed and developed a formalization in terms of 
  [[(2,1)-dimensional Euclidean field theory]]

* xxx, yyy, and zzz have constructed [[factorization algebra]]s,
  that realize the Witten genus

  (...)

This can be refined to a morphism of [[ring spectra]]

$$
 \sigma : MString \to tmf
$$

from the [[string cobordism ring]] to the [[tmf]]-spectrum.
