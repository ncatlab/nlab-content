Unsurprisingly, _enriched category theory_ studies [[enriched category|enriched categories]].

But maybe surprisingly, enriched category theory proves to be more that just the study of a given mathematical structures. Compare [[category theory]].

## as a tool in higher category theory ##

The combination of enriched category theory with [[model category]] theory -- in particular where they meet in the form of [[enriched homotopical category|enriched homotopical categories]] such as [[enriched model category|enriched model categories]], notably [[simplicial model category|simplicially enriched model categories]] -- are a major tool for [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presenting]] [[(infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categories]].

In this combined toolkit 

* the enrichment itself models the existence of higher [[k-morphism]]s

* while the homotopical structure takes care of the right notion of equivalences.

See also [[homotopy coherent category theory]].
