## Idea

In [[type theory]] the kind of [[type]] corresponding in [[categorical semantics]] to a [[quotient object]] / [[coequalizer]].


## Properties

### From higher inductive types

Quotient type may be constructed as [[higher inductive types]]. See [here](higher+inductive+type#QuotientsOfSets).

#### History and effectiveness

This notion of quotient type predates the general notion of higher inductive type, however; it appears already in [Martin Hofmann's thesis](#HofmannThesis).

Hofmann works in a theory that includes a [[type of propositions]] $Prop$ that may be assumed to satisfy [[proof irrelevance]] --- for instance, it might be the universe of [[h-propositions]] --- and considers the *effectiveness* of quotient types only for quotients of Prop-valued [[equivalence relations]].  This corresponds to the correct categorical notion of effectiveness (see [[Barr-exact category]]) and (as Hofmann noted) is provable in the presence of [[propositional extensionality]] (which in turn follows from the [[univalence axiom]]).

However, before the introduction of homotopy type theory and the realization of the importance of homotopy levels such as [[h-propositions]], some authors considered also quotients of arbitrary $Type$-valued "equivalence relations" (i.e. [[setoids]]).  [Maietti](#Maietti99) shows, by adapting [Diaconescu's argument](/nlab/show/excluded+middle#RelationToTheAxiomOfChoice), that "effectiveness" for quotients of this sort of "equivalence relation" implies the law of [[excluded middle]].


### From univalence
 {#FromUnivalence}

Quotient types are implied by adding [[univalence]] to [[Martin-Löf type theory]]. We indicate how this works:

A sufficient set of hypothesis that imply the existence of quotient types is this:

* ambient [[dependent product types]] [[dependent sum types]] and [[identity types]];
* availability of [[propositional truncation]];
* existence of a univalent family $U$;
* every [[h-prop]] is equivalent to some type in $U$.

In terms of [[categorical semantics]] in [[fibration categories]], this comes about as follows:

In [[fibration categories]] where every map is a fibration, "hprop" means
"[[subobject]]", propositional truncation becomes a stable [[image]]
factorisation, and from a univalent universe $U$ containing all hprops,
we can construct a [[subobject classifier]] as 

$$
  \underset{x \colon U}{\sum} isProp(x)
  \,.
$$

(For the subobject classification axioms: existence comes from "every
hprop is equivalent to some type in $U$", and uniqueness comes from
univalence of $U$.)  

So in this setting, the HoTT argument just becomes the usual construction (due to [Par&#233; 74](#Pare), see for instance [MacLane-Moerdijk 92, IV.5](#MacLaneMoerdijk92)) of exact quotients from a [[subobject classifier]] in a [[regular category|regular]] [[locally cartesian closed category]]. For more on this see at _[quotient object -- in toposes](quotient+object#InToposes)_.

One thing to be careful about, in the [[fibration category]] setting, is
that "equivalences" as defined in type theory correspond not generally
to the original equivalences, but to the right homotopy equivalences,
which of course may be different.  This is why e.g. Mike Shulman's def
of "type-theoretic fibration category" doesn't include a class of
equivalences as separate data, but takes them to be the right homot
equivs.  So for the type-theoretic arguments to apply, "univalent
fibration" should be defined using right homot equivs.

### From univalence
 {#FromUnivalenceReferences}

The argument that adding [[univalence]] (plus universe resizing) to [[Martin-Löf type theory]] implies the existence of quotient types is attributed to Voevodsky in places like here: [pdf, slides 41 & 61](http://benediktahrens.net/talks/IRIT_slides.pdf).
  
Voevodsky's own account of this seems to be entirely in his Coq-code repository here:

* [[Vladimir Voevodsky]], _Equivalence classes with respect to a given relation_,
[here](https://github.com/vladimirias/Foundations/blob/df19211f602ab71ee44f0ae4de2a19170c5b9e4d/hlevel2/hSet.v#L466), _Set quotients of types_, 
[here](https://github.com/vladimirias/Foundations/blob/df19211f602ab71ee44f0ae4de2a19170c5b9e4d/hlevel2/hSet.v#L555)

A more readable version of this is in section 6.10 of 

* _[[Homotopy Type Theory -- Univalent Foundations of Mathematics]]_

Def. 6.10.5 there is the definition of the quotients.  This uses
truncation, for which something like univalence and resizing is
necessary and univalence and truncation is sufficient for. 
Then theorem 6.10.6 right below that definition checks that these
quotient do indeed behave like quotients should, and this is where
univalence proper comes in.

This discussion of quotients from univalence in the HoTT book
originally comes from 

* [[Egbert Rijke]], [[Bas Spitters]], _Sets in homotopy type theory_,
([arXiv:1305.3835](http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.3835))

The relevant section there is 2.4 "Voevodsky's impredicative
quotients", see def. 2.24 and the lines right below.
