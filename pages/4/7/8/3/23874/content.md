## Idea 

A **loop digraph object** [[internalization|internal to]] a [[category]] is an [[object]] that behaves in that category like loop [[digraphs]] do in [[Set]].

##Â Definition 

### In a category with finite products

A **loop digraph object** in a [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$ with [[finite products]] is

* a [[object]] $V$ in $\mathcal{C}$ 

* an object $E$ in $\mathcal{C}$

* a [[morphism]] $R:E \to V \times V$

such that $R$ is [[monic]]: for every object $A$ in $\mathcal{C}$ and morphisms $f: A \to E$ and $g: A \to E$, $R \circ f = R \circ g$ implies that $f = g$. 

### In general categories

A **loop digraph object** in a category $\mathcal{C}$ is

* a [[object]] $V$ in $\mathcal{C}$ 

* an object $E$ in $\mathcal{C}$

* a [[morphism]] $s:E \to V$

* a morphism $t:E \to V$

such that $s$ and $t$ are [[jointly monic]]: for every object $A$ in $\mathcal{C}$ and morphisms $f: A \to E$ and $g: A \to E$, $s \circ f = s \circ g$ and $t \circ f = t \circ g$ imply that $f = g$. 

## Properties

A loop digraph object is equivalently an object with an [[internal relation|internal binary endorelation]].
