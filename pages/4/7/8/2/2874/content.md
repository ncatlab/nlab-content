_Theory and Applications of Categories_ (or just _TAC_) is an online journal about [[category theory]].  In addition to new material, they also make available important classics that have been hard to find.

The website is &lt;http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/>, from which you have access to all articles in all issues.  Note that `http://www.tac.mta.ca/` does *not* work.

Controversies: TAC is a high quality journal with an impressive [editorial board](http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/geninfo.html#edlist) but unfortunately not listed on commercial lists of prestigious journals like "Science Citation Index" and "Current Contents"; we should fight on improving this. Unfortunately, also the citations from TAC are not yet counted on MathSciNet either due nonpopularity of category theory in the leadership of AMS.
