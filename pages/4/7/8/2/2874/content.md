_Theory and Applications of Categories_ (or just _TAC_) is an online journal about [[category theory]].  In addition to new material, they also make available important classics that have been hard to find.

The website is &lt;http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/>, from which you have access to all articles in all issues.  Note that `http://www.tac.mta.ca/` does *not* work.

Controversies: _TAC_ is a high-quality journal with an impressive [editorial board](http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/geninfo.html#edlist), but unfortunately it is not listed on commercial lists of prestigious journals like the "Science Citation Index" and "Current Contents"; we should fight to improve this. Unfortunately, also the citations from _TAC_ are not yet counted on MathSciNet either, due to the unpopularity of category theory in the leadership of the AMS.

[[Urs Schreiber]]: lately I have been wondering what will be happening to this unpopularity of category theory among AMS in light of recent developments. Before long and opposing category theory in math will be a bit like opposing the use of complex numbers (there was a time what that was vehemently opposed by some, too) and currently the impetus of this development comes notably from US researches,  and there notably from AMS grantees.
