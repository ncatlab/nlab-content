## Idea

In [[higher category theory]], a concept of _opetopic omega-category_ is one of _[[weak omega-category]]_ modeled [[opetope|opetopic]] [[geometric shape for higher structures|shapes]].

There arevarious flavors of the definition. Typically they all say that an opetopic omega-catgeory is an [[opetopic set]] equipped with certain [[structure]] and [[property]]. 

## Definitions

In the definition of ([Palm](#Palm)) the extra structure is that some cells are labeled as "thin" (as [[equivalences]]) and the extra property are higher dimensional [[horn]]-filler conditions:

1. given a [[horn]] ("niche", "nook") obtained from an [[opetope]] by discarding the [[codimension]]-0 interior and the outgoing [[codimension]]-1 face, then there is a filler opetope whose codimension-0 interior is marked as an equivalence. The filling outgoing codimension-1 face is marked an equivalence if all the other codimension-1 faces are.

1. given a [[horn]] ("niche", "nook") obtained from an [[opetope]] by discarding the [[codimension]]-0 interior and an incoming codimension-1 face such that all the remaining codimension-1 faces are marked as equivalences, then there exists a filler both whose codimension-1 and codimension-0 cell are marked as equivalences.

This definition has been given a [[syntax|syntactic]] formulation by ([Finster 12](#Finster12)) in terms of _[[opetopic type theory]]_.
