A [[category]] $C$ is **presentable** if

* $C$ is [[locally small category]]

* it has all small [[colimit]]s;

* there exists a [[set]] $S$ (i.e. not a proper class) of [[object]]s that generates $C$ under colimits

  (every object may be written as a colimit over a diagram in $S$)

* every object is a [[small object]],


Locally presentable categories are the categories of [[sketch|models of limit-sketches]].

The definition is due to

* P. Gabriel and F. Ulmer (1971)

See also section A.1.1 of 

* [[Jacob Lurie]], [[Higher Topos Theory]]

where locally presentable categories are called just [[presentable category|presentable categories]].
