##Idea##

Event structures were introduced in order to abstract away from the precise 'places' and times at which events occur in distributed systems. The structure focuses on the events and the causal ordering between them.


##Definition##

Event structures in the following sense are sometimes also called *prime* event structures. 

\begin{definition}
An *event structure* is a tuple $(E,\leq, \mathrm{Con})$ consisting of a [[poset]] $(E,\le)$ of _events_, and a nonempty set $\mathrm{Con} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(E)$ of _consistent subsets_, satisfying the following axioms:

*  finite causes: for every event $e$ the set $\{e'\mid e'\le e\}$ is finite;

* if $e \in E$ then $\{ e \} \in \mathrm{Con}$;  

* if $X \in \mathrm{Con}$ and $Y \subseteq X$ then $Y \in \mathrm{Con}$; 

* if $X \in \mathrm{Con}$, $e \in X$, and $e' \leq e$, then $X \cup \{ e\} \in \mathrm{Con}$;

\end{definition}

A restricted but simpler definition is as follows: 

\begin{definition}
An *event structure with binary conflict* is a tuple $(E, \leq, \#)$, where $(E, {\leq})$ is a [[poset]] and $\#$ is an irreflexive binary relation on $E$, the *conflict relation*, satisfying: 

* finite causes: for every event $e$ the set $\{e'\mid e'\le e\}$ is finite;

* hereditary conflict: if $e \#  e'$ and $e' \leq e''$ then $e \# e''$. 

\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
If $(E, \leq, \#)$ is an event structure with binary conflict, then defining $\mathrm{Con} = \{ X \subseteq E \mid \forall e, e' \in X. \neg (e \# e') \} $
makes $(E, \leq, \Con)$ an event structure. 

Conversely, if an event structure $(E, \leq, \mathrm{Con})$ satisfies 
\[ 
\forall X \subseteq E. (\forall e, e' \in X. \neg (e \# e')) \implies X \in \mathrm{Con}
\]
then defining $\# = \{ (e, e') \mid \{ e, e'\} \in \mathrm{Con} \}$  makes $(E, \leq, \#)$ an event structure with binary conflict. 
\end{proposition}

That is, event structures with binary conflict correspond to event structures in which pairwise consistency implies mutual consistency.  

Let $\mathbb{E} = (E,\le, \sharp)$ be an event structure. Define its set of **configurations**, 
$C(\mathbb{E}) = C(E,\le, \sharp)$, to consist of those subsets $X \subseteq E$, which are 
 
* conflict-free: if $e, e'\in X$ then $\neg (e\sharp e')$,

and 

*  downward closed:  if $e\in X$, $\downarrow e\subseteq X$.
\end{definition}

A morphism $f : \mathbb{E}\to \mathbb{E}'$ of event structures consists of a [[partial function]] $f : E \to  E'$ such that 

* if 
$X\in C(\mathbb{E})$, then $f(X) \in C(\mathbb{E}')$

and 

*  if $e_0$ and $e_1$ are in $X$ with both $f(e_0)$ and $f(e_1)$ defined and  $f(e_0)=f(e_1)$ then $e_0 = e_1$. 



####Gloss####
This second condition says that if both $f(e_0)$ and $f(e_1)$ are defined and either $f(e_0)\sharp' f(e_1)$ or $f(e_0)=f(e_1)$, then either $e_0\sharp e_1$, or $e_0 = e_1$. 


Winskel and Neilsen explain the definition as follows: 

_A morphism $f : \mathbb{E}\to \mathbb{E}'$ between event structures expresses how behaviour in $\mathbb{E}$ determines behaviour in $\mathbb{E}'$. The partial function, $f$, expresses how the occurrence of an event in $\mathbb{E}$ implies the simultaneous occurrence of an event in $\mathbb{E}'$; the fact that $f(e) = e'$ can be understood as expressing that the event $e$ is a ''component'' of the event $e'$ and, in this sense, that the occurrence of $e$ implies the simultaneous occurrence of $e'$. If two distinct events in $\mathbb{E}$ have the same image in $\mathbb{E}'$ under $f$ then they cannot belong to the same configuration. _

(There is more discussion of the notion of morphism of event structures in the notes referred to  below.)


With this definition of morphism, we get the category, $\mathbf{ES}$ of event structures.



In some sources, rather than stress the _inconsistency relation_, the complementary _consistency relation_.  This leads to the definition of a family, $Con$, of finite subsets of $E$, which satisfy


* $\{e\}\in E$ for all $e\in E$;

* $Y\subseteq X\in Con$ implies $Y\in Con$,

and 

* $X\in Con$ and $e\leq e'\in X$ then $X\cup \{e\}\in Con$.
