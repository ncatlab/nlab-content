##Definition##

Let $C$ be an [[abelian category]] or at least a [[Quillen exact category]].  The **Grothendieck group** of $C$, denoted $K(C)$, is the [[abelian group]] generated by [[isomorphism class]]es of objects of $C$, with relations of the form 

$$[B] = [A] + [C] $$

whenever there is a [[short exact sequence]] 

$$ 0 \to A \to B \to C \to 0 $$


##Examples##

The Grothendieck group of the [[category of chain complexes|category of bounded chain complexes]] of [[vector bundle]]s on a space $X$ is called the [[topological K-theory]] of $X$.

The Grothendieck group of the category of finite-dimensional complex-linear [[representations]] of a [[group]] is called its [[representation ring]].

These two examples illustrate a general fact: the Grothendieck group of a [[monoidal category|monoidal]] [[abelian category]] inherits a ring structure from the tensor product in this category, and thus becomes a ring, called the [[Grothendieck ring]].

[[Urs Schreiber]]: the category of vector bundles is not abelian, but just Quillen exact. I added a clause to that effect above. Also I think to get topological K-theory using the algebraic K-theory that is described here one needs to use not the category of vector bundles itself, but its category of bounded complexes. I also added a clause to that effect.

Generally, my feeling is that "Grothendieck group" refers to "Grothendieck group completion of a monoid". The first definition at the Wikipedia entry on Gorthendieck group. 

What is described here -- the group defined by sequences -- is the definition of the K-theory group in algebraic K-theory. This is described at the beginning of [[K-theory]]. 

I'd think that the logic is rather that in some cases both concepts happen to coincide: the algebraic K-theory of the category of bounded complexes of vector bundles on a space happens to coincide with the Grothendieck group completion of the monoid of isomorphism classes of vector bundles.

My feeling is that the Wikipedia entry is a bit suboptimal in its second part, where it effectively calls algebraic K-theory the "Grothendieck group completion". I'd think one shouldn't do that in this generality.

Another thing in this context is the statement about the exact sequences. It is really the _homotopy_ exact sequences namely the [[fibration sequence]]s that count. Of course some of them can be computed by ordinary exact sequences if these are sufficiently cofibrant. That's what the structure provided by a [[Waldhausen category]] structure provides: a realization of the homotopy exact sequences as pushouts of cofibration morphisms. 

So in summary my feeling is: the entry in its current form actually tries to define algebraic K-theory and not the Grothendieck group concept, and that description with a few subtleties taken care of is currently at [[K-theory]] and should eventually be copied/moved to [[algebraic K-theory]]. The entry titled "Grothendieck group" should discuss the concept where from a monoid $A$ a group structure on $A \times A$ is defined by dividing out the equivalence relation $(a_1,b_1) \sim (a_2,b_2) \Leftrightarrow \exists k : a_1 + b_2 + k = a_2 + b_1 + k$.

But maybe I am mixed up. Let me know what you think.

_Toby_:  Well, I\'ll say this: I always understood 'Grothendieck group' in the article text above, and I never understood 'K-theory'.  That may have been my fault, of course, and it may be telling that I was John\'s student.
