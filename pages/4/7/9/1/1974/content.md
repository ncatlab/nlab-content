##Definition##

Let $C$ be an [[abelian category]].  The **Grothendieck group** of $C$, denoted $K(C)$, is the [[abelian group]] generated by [[isomorphism class]]es of objects of $C$, with relations of the form 

$$[B] = [A] + [C] $$

whenever there is a [[short exact sequence]] 

$$ 0 \to A \to B \to C \to 0 $$


##Examples##

The Grothendieck group of the category of [[vector bundle]]s on a space $X$ is called its [[K-theory]].  

The Grothendieck group of the category of finite-dimensional complex-linear [[representations]] of a [[group]] is called its [[representation ring]].

These two examples illustrate a general fact: the Grothendieck group of a [[monoidal category|monoidal]] [[abelian category]] inherits a ring structure from the tensor product in this category, and thus becomes a ring, called the [[Grothendieck ring]].
