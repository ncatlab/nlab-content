## Idea

A _differential form with logarithmic singularities_ is a [[meromorphic function|meromorphic]] [[differential form]] on some space $X$ which is a [[holomorphic differential form]] on a suitably dense open subspace with at most [[logarithm|logarithmic]] [[singularities]] at the boundary. 

These are the differential forms on spaces in [[logarithmic geometry]]. They form the logarithmic generalization of the [[holomorphic de Rham complex]].
