An [[object]] $U$ in a category $C$ is **subterminal** if any two [[morphism]]s with [[target]] $U$ are equal.  If $C$ has a [[terminal object]] $1$ this is equivalent to saying that the unique map $U\to 1$ is [[monomorphism|monic]]; hence the name "sub-terminal."  If $C$ has finite products, it is equivalent to saying that the diagonal $U\to U\times U$ is an isomorphism.

The subterminal objects in a [[topos]] can be viewed as its "external [[truth value]]s."  For example, in the topos $Sh(X)$ of sheaves on a [[topological space]] $X$, the subterminal objects are precisely the open sets in $X$.
