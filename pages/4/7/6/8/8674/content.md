Let $G$ be a [[finite group]] with [[order of a group|order]] ${\vert G\vert} \in \mathbb{N}$.

###### Theorem
**(Cauchy)**

If a [[prime number]] $p$ divides ${\vert G\vert}$, then equivalently

* $G$ has an element of [[order of an element|order]] $p$;

* $G$ has a [[subgroup]] of [[order of a group|order]] $p$.
