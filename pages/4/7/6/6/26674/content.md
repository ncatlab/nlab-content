## Idea and definition

Compactly assembled (∞,1)-categories are characterized among [[presentable (∞,1)-categories]] by the following equivalent conditions (due to Clausen and Lurie):

* They are [[retracts]] in the (∞,1)-category of [[presentable (∞,1)-categories]] and [[left adjoints]] of [[compactly generated (∞,1)-categories]].

* Small [[(∞,1)-limits]] distribute over [[(∞,1)-filtered (∞,1)-colimits]].

* The [[colimit]] (∞,1)-functor $Ind(C)\to C$ admits a left adjoint.

* See Theorem 2.2.11 in Nikolaus for a few other conditions.

## Examples

[[(∞,1)-sheaves]] of [[∞-groupoids]] on a [[locally compact]] Hausdorff [[topological space]] form a compactly assembled (∞,1)-category.
