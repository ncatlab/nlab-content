## Idea

In the area of [[quantum computing]], *surface codes* are [[quantum error correcting codes]] which utilize in imaginary [[surface]] (really a discrete [[lattice]]) of physical [[qubits]], with nearest-neighbour interactions, on which error-protected logical qubits are encoded.  A key example is known as the *[[toric code]]*.

Surface codes are also referred to as *topological quantum error correcting codes*, since the effective error protection translates into [[topology|topological]] ([[homotopy theory|homotopical]]) properties of the approximated surface. But is important to note the difference to qubit stabilization by fundamental physical topological effects as envisioned in [[topological quantum computing]]. One may regard surface codes as implementing a *[[quantum simulation]]* of actual hardware-level topological protection.
