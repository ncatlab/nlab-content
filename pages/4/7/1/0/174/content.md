## Idea 

The term _brane_ referes in formal high energy [[physics]] and in particular in [[string theory]] to entities that one thinks of as physical objects that generalize the notion point particles to higher dimensional objects.

The term derives from the word _membrane_ that was originally used to describe 2-dimensional "particles". When the need was felt to speak also about 3-, 4- and higher dimensional such "particles" the usage "3-brane", "4-brane" etc. was introduced. Ordinary particles would be 0-branes in this counting, the strings in [[string theory]] would be 1-branes and membranes themselves 2-branes.

There are however two fundamentally different concrete realizations of this somewhat vague notion.

* **fundamental or $\sigma$-model branes**

  A [[sigma-model]] [[quantum field theory]] with parameter space a $k+1$-dimensional manifold $\Sigma$ and target space $X$ may be thought of as describing the quantum mechanics of a $k$-brane object in $X$. 

  In this context one speaks of $\Sigma$ as a _fundamental_ $k$-brane propagating in $X$. 

  * For $k=0$ this describes the ordinary quantum mechanics of a point particle on $X$. And such point particles are the _fundamental particles_ for instance of the [[standard model of particle physics]].

  * For $k=1$ this describes the quantum propagation of a [[string theory|string]], and accordingly one speaks of the _fundamental string_ of F1-brane (fundamental 1-brane).

  * For $k=2$ this describes the quantum propagation of a membrane. 

  * There are good indications that there is a way to describe heterotic [[string theory]] not in terms of fundamental 1-branes but in terms of the [[sigma-model]] of a fundamental 5-brane -- the [[magnetic charge|magnetic dual]] of the 1-brane in 10-dimensions. 

  * etc.

* **boundary conditions or D-branes**

  A related but a priori very different notion of brane is that properly called **D-brane** for _Dirichlet_-brane. The term arises from the characterization of boundary conditions for 1-brane [[sigma-model]]s. Today one identifies more generally

  * a D-brane is by definition a boundary condition for a 1+1-dimensional [[sigma-model]]

  For instance in the description of rational [[conformal field theory]] in terms of Frobenius algebra objects $A$ inside a [[modular tensor category]] $C$, the category $Mod_C(A)$ of $A$-[[module]] objects [[internalization|internal to]] $C$ is the category of D-branes for the [[conformal field theory|CFT]] encoded by $A$.

  At least for 2-dimensional [[TQFT]]s analogous considerations yield not just categories but [[stable (infinity,1)-category|stable (infinity,1)-categories]] of boundary condition objects. For instance for what is called the B-model 2-d [[TQFT]] the category of D-branes is the [[derived category]] of coherent sheaves on some Calabi-Yau space.

  In simple special cases, however, bouandray conditions for [[sigma-model]]s with target $X$ are encoded in terms of $k$-dimensional subspaces $Q \hoookrightarrow X$. It is those subspaces $Q$ that were originally identified as $k$-branes as extended objects. More general [[sigma-model]] boundary conditions that are not as geometrically encoded are therefore sometimes called _non-geometic D-branes_.


Starting with Kontsevich's [[homological algebra]] reformulation of [[homological mirror symmetry|mirror symmetry]] the study of (derived) D-brane categories has become a field in its own right in pure mathematics.

A classical text describing how the physics way to think of D-branes leads to seeing that they are objects in derived categories is

This can to a large extent be read as a dictionary from [[homological algebra]] terminology to that of D-brane physics.
