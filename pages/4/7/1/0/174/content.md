## Idea 

The term _brane_ in formal high energy [[physics]], and in particular in [[string theory]], refers to entities that one thinks of as physical objects that generalize the notion _point particles_ to higher dimensional objects.

The term derives from the word _membrane_ that was originally used to describe 2-dimensional "particles". When the need was felt to speak also about 3-, 4- and higher dimensional such "particles" the usage "3-brane", "4-brane" etc. was introduced. Ordinary particles would be 0-branes in this counting, the strings in [[string theory]] would be 1-branes and membranes themselves 2-branes.

Generally, there are two different incarnations of branes

1. **fundamental $p$-branes** (as in "[[fundamental particle]]"): these are given by [[sigma-models]] on $(p+1)$-dimensional [[worldvolumes]] describing propagation of single $p$-dimensional objects on certain [[target spacetimes]]. If these sigma-models are required to exhibit manifest [[target spacetime]] [[supersymmetry]], then they are [[Green-Schwarz sigma models]], which are classified by a "[[brane scan]]" in [[super L-infinity algebra]] [[L-infinity algebra cohomology|cohomology]];

1. **[[black branes|black p-branes]]** (as in "[[black hole]]"): these are [[soliton|solitonic]] solutions to [[field theories]], typically [[supergravity]] theories, with [[singularities]] of [[dimension]] $(p+1)$. In analogy to how a [[charged black hole]] ($p = 0$) [[source|sources]] an [[electromagnetic field]] with [[field strength]] 2-form, so black $p$-branes source $(p+2)$-form [[higher gauge fields]] and hence appear in those [[supergravity]] theories where such exists.

The idea is that these two concepts match where a [[condensate]] of fundamental $p$-branes turns into a black $p$-branes.


 
Indeed, the classical [[no-hair theorem]] matches [[fundamental particles]] (i.e. 0-branes) characterized (via the [[Wigner classification]]) by just their [[mass]], electromagnetic [[charge]] and [[angular momentum]]  to [[black hole]] solutions of pure vacuum gravity. Accordingly, it is an old suggestion ([Einstein-Infeld-Hoffmann 39](#EinsteinInfeldHoffmann39)) that fundamental particles could be identified with singular solutions of vacuum gravity.

This matching generalizes to higher dimensional $p$-branes in higher dimensional [[supergravity]] and there is an exact correspondence between fundamental [[Green-Schwarz super p-branes]] and extremal [[BPS solutions|BPS]] black brane solutions.
 
In [[string theory]] there is a third incarnation of branes, known as 

* **[[D-branes]]**: these are the admissible [[boundary conditions]] for the 2-dimensional [[sigma models]] describing [[open strings]].  

One envisions that as one passes from [[perturbative string theory]] to the [[non-perturbative effect|non-perturbative]] version of the theory ("[[M-theory]]") these [[D-branes]] show [[back-reaction]] and turn into the [[UV-completion]] of the [[black branes]] seen in the [[supergravity]] [[effective field theory]]. This relation is key in the microscopic computation of [[black hole entropy]] for [[black holes in string theory]].
 



### Boundary conditions or D-branes
 {#Dbranes}

Some words on [[D-branes]]

#### In terms of the algebraic data of the QFT on the worldvolume

An abstractly defined $n$-dimensional [[quantum field theory]] is a consistent assignment of [[state]]-space and correlators to $n$-dimensional [[cobordisms]] with certain structure (topological structure, conformal structure, Riemannian structure, etc. see [[FQFT]]/[[AQFT]]). In an _open-closed QFT_ the cobordisms are allowed to have boundaries. See at _[[boundary field theory]]_ for more on this.

In this abstract formulation of QFT a **brane** is a type of data assigned by the QFT to boundaries of cobordisms. 

##### In $2d$ rational CFT

A well understood class of examples is this one: among all 2-dimensional [[conformal field theory]], the case of _full rational 2d CFT_ has been understood completely, using [[FFRS-formalism]]. It is then a theorem that full 2-rational CFTs are classified by 

1. a [[modular tensor category]] $\mathcal{C}$ (to be thought of as being the category of representations of the [[vertex operator algebra]] of the 2d CFT);

1. a special symmetric [[Frobenius algebra]] object $A$ [[internalization|internal]] to $\mathcal{C}$.

In this formulation a type of **brane** of the theory is precisely an $A$-[[module]] in $\mathcal{C}$ (an $A$-[[bimodule]] is a [[bi-brane]] or _defect line_ ):

the 2d cobordisms with boundary on which the theory defined by $A \in \mathcal{C}$ carry as extra structure on their connected boundary pieces a label given by an equivalence class of an $A$-module in $\mathcal{C}$. The assignment of the CFT to such a cobordism with boundary is obtained by

* triangulating the cobordism, 

* labeling all internal edges by $A$

* labelling all boundary pieces by the $A$-module

* all vertices where three internal edges meet by the multiplication operation 

* and all points where an internal edge hits a moundary by the corresponding [[action]] morphism 

* and finally evaluating the resulting [[string diagram]] in $\mathcal{C}$.

So in this abstract algebraic formulation of QFT on the worldvolume, a brane is just the datum assigned by the QFT to the boundary of a cobordism. But abstractly defined QFTs may arise from [[quantization]] of [[sigma model]]s. This gives these boundary data a geometric interpretation in some space. This we discuss in the next section.

##### In $2d$ TFT

Another case where the branes of a QFT are under good mathematical control is [[TCFT]]: the [[(infinity,1)-category]]-version of a 2d [[TQFT]].

Particularly the [[A-model]] and the [[B-model]] are well understood.

* the branes of the B-model ("B-branes") form the the [[stable (infinity,1)-category]] of [[chain complex]]es of [[quasicoherent sheaves]] on the target space (often considered just in terms of its [[homotopy category of an (infinity,1)-category]], the [[derived category]] of quasicoherent sheaves);

*  the branes of the A-model form the [[Fukaya category]] of the target space.

(...)


#### In terms of geometric data of the $\sigma$-model background 

An abstractly defined QFT (as a consistent assignment of state spaces and propagators to cobordisms as in [[FQFT]]) may be obtained by [[quantization]] from _geometric data_ :

Sich a _[[sigma-model]] QFT_ is the [[quantization]] of an [[action functional]] on a space of maps $\Sigma \to X$ from a cobordims ("worldvolume") $\Sigma$ to some target space $X$ that may carry further geoemtric data such as a [[Riemannian metric]],  or other background [[gauge field]]s.

One may therefore try to match the geometric data on $X$ that encodes the $\sigma$-model with the algebraic data of the [[FQFT]] that results after quantization. This gives a geometric interpretation to many of the otherwise purely abstract algebraic properties of the worldvolume QFT.

It turns out that if one checks which geometric data corresponds to the $A$-modules in the above discussion, one finds that these tend to come from structures that look at least roughly like _submanifolds_ of the target space $X$. And typically these submanifolds themselves carry their own background [[gauge field]] data.

A well-understood case is the [[Wess-Zumino-Witten model]]: for this the target space $X$ is a simple [[Lie group]] $X = G$ and the background field is a [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle 2-bundle with connection]] (a [[bundle gerbe]]) on $G$, representing the background field that is known as the [[Kalb-Ramond field]].

In this case it turns out that branes for the sigma model on $X$ are given in the smplest case by conjugacy classes $D \subset G$ inside the group, and that these carry [[twisted bundle|twisted vector bundle]] with the twist given by the Kalb-Ramond background bundle. These vector bundles are known in the [[string theory]] literature as _Chan-Paton vector bundles_ . The geometric intuition is that a QFT with certain boundary condition comes form a quantization of spaces of maps $\Sigma \to G$ that are restricted to take the boundary of $\Sigma$ to these submanifolds.

More generally, one finds that the geometric data that corresponds to the branes in the algebraically defined 2d QFT is given by cocycles in the twisted [[differential K-theory]] of $G$. These may be quite far from having a direct interpretation as submanifolds of $G$.

The case of rational 2d CFT considered so far is only the best understood of a long sequence of other examples. Here the collection of all [[D-branes]] -- identified with the colleciton of all internal modules over an internal frobenius algebra, forms an ordinary [[category]].

More generally, at least for 2-dimensional [[TQFT]]s analogous considerations yield not just categories but [[stable (âˆž,1)-categories]] of boundary condition objects. For instance for what is called the [[B-model]] 2-d [[TQFT]] the category of [[D-branes]] is the [[derived category]] of [[coherent sheaves]] on some Calabi-Yau space.

Starting with Kontsevich's [[homological algebra]] reformulation of [[homological mirror symmetry|mirror symmetry]] the study of (derived) D-brane categories has become a field in its own right in pure mathematics.

... lots of further things to say ...


### Fundamental or $\sigma$-model branes

In [[string theory]] one speaks apart from the [[D-branes]] also about **fundamental branes** . These are the objects $\Sigma$ in the $n$-dimensional [[sigma model]] themselves.

* For $n=0$ this describes the ordinary quantum mechanics of a point particles on $X$. And such point particles are the _fundamental particles_ for instance of the [[standard model of particle physics]].

* For $n=1$ this describes the quantum propagation of a [[string theory|string]], and accordingly one speaks of the _fundamental string_ or F1-brane (fundamental 1-brane).

* For $n=2$ this describes the quantum propagation of a membrane. 

* There are good indications that there is a way to describe heterotic [[string theory]] not in terms of fundamental 1-branes but in terms of the [[sigma-model]] of a fundamental 5-brane -- the [[magnetic charge|magnetic dual]] of the 1-brane in 10-dimensions. 

* etc.

### The super-brane scan

If the worldvolume QFT of the fundamental branes (for instance the worlsheet 2d[[CFT]] of the string) is required to be a [[supersymmetric QFT]], specifically if the [[Green-Schwarz action functional]] is used only particular combinations of the dimenion $dim \Sigma = p + 1$ of the worldvolume and $D = dim X$ of [[spacetime]] are possible.
