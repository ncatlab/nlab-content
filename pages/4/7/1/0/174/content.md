Using insights from

* categorical-algebraic formulations of 2-dimensional [[conformal field theory|CFT]] (namely the [[FRS formalism]]);

* as well as Langland's duality in topological QFT;

one finds generalization of branes to [[bi-brane|bi-branes]] which on the worldsheet realize themselves as [[defect line|defect lines]].
