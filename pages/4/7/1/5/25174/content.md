## Idea

Since every [[ordered local integral domain]] $R$ has [[characteristic zero]], the positive integers $\mathbb{Z}_+$ are a subset of $R$, with [[injection]] $i:\mathbb{Z}_+ \hookrightarrow R$. An **Archimedean ordered local integral domain** is an [[ordered local integral domain]] which satisfies the [[archimedean property]]: for all elements $a \in R$ and $b \in R$, if $0 \lt a$ and $0 \lt b$, then there exists a positive integer $n \in \mathbb{Z}_+$ such that such that $a \lt i(n) \cdot b$. 

Archimedean ordered local integral domains are important because they are the [[ordered local rings]] with [[infinitesimals]] but no [[infinite elements]], infinitesimals for which the zero-product property fails, or invertible infinitesimals. These play an important role in some approaches to [[analysis]] and [[differential geometry]], such as the approaches where the ring of [[formal power series]] with $n$ commuting variables on the [[real numbers]] is used to model [[infinitesimals]] in the real line. 

[[Archimedean ordered fields]] are the Archimedean ordered local integral domains in which every non-invertible element is equal to zero. However, unlike Archimedean ordered fields, Archimedean ordered local integral domains can be defined inside of an arbitrary [[arithmetic pretopos]] in [[coherent logic]].
