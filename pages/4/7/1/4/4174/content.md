## Idea

The notion of _Lie 2-group_ is the generalization of the notion of [[Lie group]] as [[group]]s are generalized to [[2-group]]s.

One general way to make the notion precise is as a special case of an [[âˆž-Lie groupoid]]. Special cases of this have simpler definitions. For instance a [[crossed module]] [[internal category|internal]] to [[Diff]] is a model for a strict and comparatively tame Lie 2-group.

Analogous to how the [[infinitesimal object|infinitesimal]] version of a [[Lie group]] is a [[Lie algebra]], the infinitesimal version of a Lie 2-group is a [[Lie 2-algebra]].

## Examples

* Every [[crossed module]] of Lie groups $(H \to G )$, $G \to Aut(H)$ gives an example of a strict Lie 2-group, using the general relation between crossed modules and [[strict 2-group]]s. 

  For instance the crossed module $Spin(n) \to O(n)$. Or $(U(1) \to 1)$.
  Etc.

* The [[string 2-group]] $String(G)$ 
  has various different but equivalent incarnations
  as a Lie 2-group. One is given by the [[crossed module]]
  $\hat \Omega_* G \to P_* G$ internal to [[Frechet manifold|Frechet]]
  Lie groups.
