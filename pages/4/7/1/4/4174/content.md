## Idea

The notion of _Lie 2-group_ is the generalization of the notion of [[Lie group]] as [[group]]s are generalized to [[2-group]]s.

One general way to make the notion precise is as a special case of an [[âˆž-Lie groupoid]]. Special cases of this have simpler definitions. For instance a [[crossed module]] [[internal category|internal]] to [[Diff]] is a model for a strict and comparatively tame Lie 2-group.

Analogous to how the [[infinitesimal object|infinitesimal]] version of a [[Lie group]] is a [[Lie algebra]], the infinitesimal version of a Lie 2-group is a [[Lie 2-algebra]].

## Examples
