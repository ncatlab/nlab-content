**Marius Sophus Lie** (1842--1899) was a pioneer of study of (and almost solely devoted to) the groups of continuous and smooth transformations, mainly motivated by symmetries of differential equations. He is considered a founder of the theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras, whose global theory however has been completed only with works of [[Ã‰lie Cartan]]. See [[Lie group]], [[Lie algebra]], [[Lie groupoid]], [[Lie's three theorems]].
