## Definition

For $(X,g)$ a [[Riemannian manifold]], the [[exterior differential]] is a [[differential operator]] on  (sections of the) [[exterior bundle]]. With respect to the induced [[inner product]] write $d^\ast$ for its [[adjoint operator]]. The _K&#228;hler-Dirac operator_ is $d + d^\ast$.

## Properties

The K&#228;hler-Dirac operator defines a canonical [[K-homology]] class on $X$.
