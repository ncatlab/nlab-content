 {#PolyakovGaugeStringDualitySection}

Key ideas underlying what is now known as *[[AdS-CFT correspondence|holographic]] [[duality in string theory|duality in]] [[string theory]]* and specifically as *[[AdS-QCD correspondence|holographic QCD]]* (see also at *[[holographic light front QCD]]*) were preconceived by [[Alexander Polyakov]] (cf. historical reminiscences in [Polyakov (2008)](#Polyakov08)) under the name *[[gauge/string duality]]*, in efforts to understand [[confinement|confined]] [[QCD]] (the [[mass gap problem]]) by regarding [[color charge|color]]-[[flux tubes]] ([[Wilson lines]]) between [[quarks]] as dynamical [[strings]].

The logic here proceeds in the following steps (cf. [Polyakov (2007), §1](#Polyakov07) and see the commentary [below](#NoticeTheDecisiveInsight)):

1. **flux tubes confine as dynamical strings**

   The starting point is the [[hypothesis]] that the strong coupling of particles (such as [[quarks]]) by a (non-abelian) [[gauge field]] (such as the [[strong nuclear force]]) is embodied by the formation of "[[flux tubes]]" ("[[Wilson lines]]") between pairs of such particles, which in themselves behave like [[strings]] with a given [[tension]].

   $[$[Kogut & Susskind (1974)](#KogutSusskind74), [(1975)](#KogutSusskind75); [Wilson (1974)](#Wilson74); [Polyakov (1979)](#Polyakov79), [(1980)](#Polyakov80), [(1987)](#Polyakov80); [Makeenko & Migdal (1981)](#MakeenkoMigdal81), following [Nambu (1970)](Nambu-Goto+action#Nambu70), [Gotō (1971)](Nambu-Goto+action#Gotō71)$]$

   Under this assumption it would be:

   1. the [[flux tube]]/[[string]]'s [[tension]] which keeps the particles at theirs endpoints [[confinement|confined]], 

   1. the excitation of these [[flux tubes]]/[[strings]] which follow [[Regge trajectories]] (such as of [[hadrons]]);

   1. the [[scattering]] of these [[flux tubes]]/[[strings]] which explains the observed [[Veneziano amplitudes]],

   which are the main qualitative features to be explained.


1. {#QuantumFluxTubesProbeHigherDim} **quantum flux tubes probe effective higher dimensions**

   But if so, famous quantum effects make such [[flux tubes]]/[[strings]] behave like propagating in an effective/emergent higher-dimensional spacetime:

   * either because one regards the string as *a priori* propagating in non-critical [[spacetime]]-[[dimension]] $4$, in which case the [[dilaton field]]/[[Liouville field]] $\phi$ appears to cancel the [[quantum anomaly]] and acts like a warped 5th dimension: 

     this was the point of view published in [Polyakov (1981)](#Polyakov81) but later claimed, in [Polyakov (2008)](#Polyakov08), to have originated already "by the end of '77";
 
   * or because one regards the string as propagating in critical dimension (10 for the [[superstring]]) right away, 

     which is the point of view adopted later in [[AdS-CFT duality]], starting with [Maldacena (1997)](AdS-CFT+correspondence#Maldacena97a)

   with only the endpoints of the [[flux tube]]/[[string]] constrained to lie in the original lower dimensional spacetime 

   $[$[Polyakov (1998)](#Polyakov98), [(1999)](#Polyakov99)$]$

   which now appears (in modern language that Polyakov did not originally use) as a "[[brane]]" inside a higher dimensional [[bulk]] spacetime.

   > Notice that in this picture the observable physics that we set out to describe takes place *on the brane* ([[underlying]] which is typically flat [[Minkowski spacetime]]!) at the [[asymptotic boundary|asymptotic]] [[boundary]] of a higher-dimensional [[bulk]] spacetime, while the (potentially large) extra dimensions of a possibly $\sim$ [[AdS]]-bulk remain primarily unobservable. In fact, in Polyakov's original picture the extra 5th dimension is not so much a spacetime dimension but a parameter for the *thickness* of the [[flux tube]], which becomes non-vanishing due to quantum effects $[$cf. [Polyakov (2008), p. 3](#Polyakov08)$]$.


1. **large/small $N$ confined gauge theory is holographic string theory/M-theory**

   Thus the description of strongly coupled matter via [[flux tubes]]/[[strings]] now reveals a [[holography|holographic]] situation where strongly-coupled quantum fields on [[intersecting brane models|intersecting branes]] are equivalently described by a theory of [[quantum gravity]] mediated by [[strings]] propagating in a higher dimensional [[bulk]] [[spacetime]].

   In relation to gauge string duality this is due to [Gubser, Klebanov & Polyakov (1998)](#GubserKlebanovPolyakov98), which is now understood as part of *[[AdS/CFT duality]]*, but it is actually meant to be more general, cf. [Polyakov & Rychkov (2000)](#PolyakovRychkov00).
  

> While this dual bulk string theory is itself strongly-coupled unless the "number of coincident branes" is humongous (the "[[large-N limit]]") and thus unrealistic after all, the difference is that recognizing the [[branes]] as physical objects reveals a web of concrete hints as to the string's strongly-coupled ([[non-perturbative quantum field theory|non-perturbative]]) completion, going under the working title *[[M-theory]]*, cf. at *[AdS-CFT -- Small $N$ corrections](AdS-CFT+correspondence#SmallNCorrections)*.

> In summary, the plausible approach of understanding strongly-coupled quantum gauge theories by regarding their [[flux tubes]] as dynamical [[strings]] seems to recast the [Millennium Problem](mass+gap#ReferencesMassGapProblem) of understanding strongly-coupled matter into the problem of formulating [[M-theory]]: Given [[M-theory]], it ought to be possible to find [[intersecting brane models]] of single (or a small number of [[coincident branes|coincident]]) [[M-branes]] (such as the *[Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model](AdS-QCD+correspondence#WittenSakaiSugimotoModel)* [[M5-brane]] system) on whose [[worldvolume]] the desired strongly-coupled field theory is realized (such as [[QCD]]).

{#NoticeTheDecisiveInsight} Notice the decisive early insight of [[Alexander Polyakov]] here: While the idea that [[strings]] somehow describe [[hadron|hadronic]] [[bound states]] was the very origin of [[string theory]] in the early 1970s ("dual resonance models"), the mainstream *abandoned* this perspective in the later 1970s when the critical dimension and the full spectrum of the string became fully understood (cf. *[[Goddard-Thorn no-ghost theorem]]*) and declared that *instead* String theory should be understood as a [[GUT|grand unified]] [[theory of everything]] including [[quantum gravity]] (see e.g. the historical review of [Veneziano (2012), esp. pp. 30-31](string+theory#Veneziano12) which still clings to this perspective). From here it was only through the long detour of first discovering, inside this grander theory: [[D-branes]] (and [[M5-branes]]) in the 1990s, then their [[near-horizon geometry|near-horizon]] [[AdS-CFT duality]] just before the 2000s and then another decade of exploring [[intersecting D-brane models]] that the community in the 2010s came back full circle to Polyakov's holographic perspective on [[QCD]], now dubbed *[[holographic QCD]]*, in which [[strings]] are [[flux tubes]] that propagate not (alone) in the observable 4 spacetime dimensions but in a primarily unobservable (meanwhile known as *[[Randall-Sundrum model|Randall-Sundrum]]*-like) higher-dimensional [[bulk]] spacetime -- a holographic description of reality that [Polyakov (1999)](#Polyakov99) referred to as the *wall of the cave*, in allusion to [[Plato]] (cf. also [Polyakov (2008), p. 6](#Polyakov08)). 

Our whereabouts in this remarkable picture are still often misunderstood today: If string theory is a theory of nature, then, it seems, we see the wall but not the cave: we live on a $\sim$[[Minkowski spacetime|Minkowskian]] [[intersecting D-brane model|brane intersection]] at the ([[asymptotic boundary|asympotic]]) [[boundary]] of a primarily unobserved $\sim$[[anti de Sitter spacetime|anti de Sitter]] [[bulk]] -- which may better be thought of not as physical space but as a configuration space of quantum flux.
