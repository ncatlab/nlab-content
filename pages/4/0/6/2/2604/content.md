A __knot invariant__ is map from [[isotopy]] classes of [[knots]] to any kind of structure you could imagine.  These are helpful because it's much easier to check that the structures one maps to (numbers, groups, etc.) are different than it is to check that knots are different.

Examples include
* [[crossing number]]
* [[bridge number]]
* [[unknotting number]]
* [[Jones polynomial]]
* [[HOMFLY polynomial]]
* [[Alexander polynomial]]
* [[Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant]]s for any object in a [[ribbon category]]
* [[Khovanov homology]]
* [[colorability]]
* [[knot group]]= the fundamental group of the complement of the knot.


Many of these extend to [[link invariant|link invariants]] or have variants that depend on the knot being oriented.
