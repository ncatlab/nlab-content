A knot invariant is map from isotopy class of knots to any kind of structure you could imagine.  These are helpful because it's much easier to check that the structures one maps to (numbers, groups, etc.) are different than it is to check that knots are different.

Examples include
* [[crossing number]]
* [[bridge number]]
* [[unkotting number]]
* [[Jones polynomial]]
* [[HOMFLY polynomial]]
* [[Alexander polynomial]]
* [[Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants]] for any object in a [[ribbon category]].
