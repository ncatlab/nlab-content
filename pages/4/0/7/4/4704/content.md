## Definition

For $G$ a [[group]] and $\mathbf{B}G$ its one-object [[delooping]] [[groupoid]], the **loop groupoid** $\mathcal{L}\mathbf{B}G$ of $G$ is the [[free loop space object]] of $\mathbf{B}G$.

This is the groupoid whose objects are the elements of $G$, and whose [[morphism]]s are of the form

$$
  g \stackrel{h}{\to} h^{-1} g h
  \,.
$$

## Applications

This plays a role in [[Dijkgraaf-Witten theory]].
