#Definition#

A **section** of a [[morphism]] $f : A \to B$ is a one-sided inverse: a [[morphism]] $\sigma : B \to A$ such that
$$
  B \stackrel{\sigma}{\to} A \stackrel{f}{\to} B
$$
is the [[identity]] on $B$.

In this case, $f$ may also be called a [[retraction]] of $\sigma$, $B$ may be called a [[retract]] of $A$, and the entire situation is said to split the [[idempotent]]
$$
  A \stackrel{f}{\to} B \stackrel{\sigma}{\to} A
.$$

A **[[split epimorphism]]** is a morphism that *has* a section; a **[[split monomorphism]]** is a morphism that *is* a section.
