A [[Grothendieck topology]] (or a [[Grothendieck pretopology]]) on a category $X$ is __subcanonical__ if every [[representable functor|representable]] [[presheaf]] is a [[sheaf]] in this Grothendieck topology (pretopology). The corresponding [[site]] is of course called a __subcanonical site__.

For a more in-depth discussion see [[subcanonical coverage]].

[[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: Does this page deserve to coexist with [[subcanonical coverage]] or should it redirect?

[[Zoran Skoda]: I did not see the other page. I looked for subcanonical topology, subcanonical site and did not find anything. Coverage is far less standard term which will be hence overlooked by a casual and external user of nlab and human google seeker for wiki pages. As you see I did not find it. Now I put the link, let it be the way it is: for example [[subcanonical coverage]] does not have the term subcanonical site explained so the search does not find that term.
