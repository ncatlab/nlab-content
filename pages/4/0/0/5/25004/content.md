## Idea

A strict order is a [[linear order]] which is not a [[linear relation]]. Strict orders are used in models of the real numbers which have [[infinitesimals]], such as in the smooth real numbers in [[synthetic differential geometry]], and thus where not every real number not greater than or less than zero is equal to zero. 

## Definition

A strict order is a binary relation $\lt$ on a set $S$ which is irreflexive, asymmetric, transitive, and a comparison:

1. for all $a \in S$, $\neg(a \lt a)$ 

2. for all $a \in S$ and $b \in S$, if $a \lt b$, then $\neg(b \lt a)$

3. for all $a \in S$, $b \in S$, and $c \in S$, if $a \lt b$ and $b \lt c$, then $a \lt c$

4. for all $a \in S$, $b \in S$, and $c \in S$, if $a \lt c$, then $a \lt b$ or $b \lt c$

## Properties

The negation of a strict order is a [[preorder]] $a \leq b \coloneqq \neg(b \lt a)$, and thus has an [[equivalence relation]] defined as $a \approx b \coloneqq a \leq b \wedge b \leq a$. Every strict order which is also a [[linear relation]] is a [[linear order]], whose negation is a [[partial order]]. Thus, in any foundations with [[quotient sets]], every strict order can be made into a linear order by taking the quotient with respect to the equivalence relation $S/\approx$.
