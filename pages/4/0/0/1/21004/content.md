## Definition

Fuzzy logic is a [[logic]] in which the [[truth values]] are [[real numbers]] in the [[closed space|closed]] [[interval]] between 0 and 1. It is used as a mathematical model of vagueness, partial truths, and imprecise information. 

## Examples

### T-norm fuzzy logics

One class of fuzzy logics is the class of **[[t-norm]] fuzzy logics**. They are characterized by [[conjunction]] being a left [[continuous function|continuous]] [[t-norm]] on the [[unit interval]]. 

Many examples of fuzzy logics are t-norm fuzzy logics, including [[basic fuzzy logic]], [[monoidal t-norm logic]], [[Gödel logic]], [[Łukasiewicz logic]], and [[product fuzzy logic]].
