## Idea 

For $G$ a [[locally compact Hausdorff space|locally compact Hausdorff]] [[topological group]], with $C_c(G)$ denoting its [[algebra of functions|algebra of]] [[compact support|compactly supported]] [[continuous functions]] from $G$ to $\mathbb{R}$,  a _Haar integral_ $\int_G $ is a [[continuous map|continuous]] [[linear map]] $C_c(G) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ to the [[real numbers]] which is [[invariant]] under the obvious [[group action]] of $G$ on $C_c(G)$. It turns out that there exists a unique such [[integral]], up to a scalar multiple. The [[Riesz representation theorem]] then allows one to conclude the existence of a unique _Haar measure_, which is a $G$-invariant [[Borel measure]] on $G$.

The archetypal example of Haar measure is the [[Lebesgue measure]] on the (additive group underlying) [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$.

## Definition

Let $G$ be a [[locally compact Hausdorff space|locally compact Hausdorff]] [[topological group]]. Let $C_c(G)$ denote the [[vector space]] of [[continuous map|continuous]] [[real numbers|real-valued]] [[functionals]] with [[compact support]] on $G$. This is a [[locally convex topological vector space]] where the locally convex structure is specified by the family of [[seminorms]] 

$$
  \rho_K(f) 
   \;=\; 
  \sup_{x \in K} {|f(x)|}
  \,,
$$ 

where $K$ ranges over [[compact subsets]] of $G$. Recall that a *[[Radon measure]]* on $G$ may be described as a continuous linear functional 

$$
  \int_G 
    \,\colon\, 
  C_c(G) \to \mathbb{R}
  \,.
$$ 

Such a Radon measure defines a [[measure]] $\mu$ on the [[sigma-algebra|$\sigma$-algebra]] of [[Borel sets]] in the usual sense of [[measure theory]], where 

$$
  \mu(B) 
   \;=\; 
  sup 
  \Big\{
     \textstyle{\int_G} f 
       \,\colon\, 
     supp(f) = K \subseteq B,\, \rho_K(f) = 1 
  \Big\}
  \,.
$$ 


In this context, a (left) **Haar integral** on $G$ is a nonzero such linear functional $\int_G$ such that
$$ 
  \int_G f 
   \;\geq\; 0 
   \;\;\text{when}\; f \geq 0
$$
$$ 
  \int_G f^g 
    \;=\; 
  \int_G f
$$
for each $f \in C_c(G)$ and each $g \in G$, where $f^g \colon G \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ sends $x$ to $f(g x)$.

Correspondingly, a (left) **Haar measure** on $G$ is a nonzero Radon measure $\mu$ such that 

$$
  \mu(g B) 
    \;=\; 
  \mu(B)
$$ 

for all $g \in G$ and all Borel sets $B$. 

## An Analogy with the Finite Case
 {#AnalogyWithTheFiniteCase}

There is an analogy between Haar measure and the scaled-[[cardinality]] of a [[finite group]]. In fact, the latter is a special case of the former, as we may view a finite group as a [[discrete topological space|discrete]] [[topological group]]. While measures on (discrete) finite groups aresubsumed by the notion of Haar measure, their explicit consideration may still be of interest to build intuition:

Let $G_{fin}$ be a finite group.  Let $G_{fin}\text{-}Rep$ be the [[category of representations|category of]] $G$-[[representations]] on $R$-[[modules]], where $R$ is a [[ring]] in which the [[group order]] ${|G_{fin}|}$ is invertible. This category is equivalent to $R[G]\text{-}Mod$. We can view $R$ as a [[trivial representation|trivial]] $G_{fin}$-representation, where $g a = a$ for each $a \in R$ and each $g \in G$.

Let $G$ be a [[compactum]]. Let $G\text{-}Ban$ be the category of [[Banach space|Banach]] representations of $G$. Objects in $G \text{-Ban}$ are [[Banach spaces]] $X$ over $\mathbb{R}$ with a continuous norm preserving action $G \times X \rightarrow X$, i.e. ${\Vert g x\Vert} = {\Vert x \Vert} \;\;\forall g \in G \forall x \in X$. Maps in $G\text{-}Ban$ are [[short maps]] which are $G$-[[equivariant map|equivariant]]. 
(Alternatively, $G\text{-}Ban$ may be viewed as a category of certain $\mathbb{R}[G]$-modules.) 
We can view $\mathbb{R}$ as a trivial $G$-representation, where $g a = a$ for each $a \in \mathbb{R}$ and each $g \in G$.

Let $C(G_{fin})$ be the ring of set-maps from $G_{fin}$ to $R$. $G$ acts on $C(G_{fin})$ where $f^g \colon G_{fin} \rightarrow R$ sends $x$ to $f(gx)$. There is a map of [[abelian groups]] $\int_{G_{fin}} \colon C(G_{fin}) \rightarrow R$ sending $f$ to $\frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G} f(g)$, analogous to the Haar integral. Indeed,
$$
  \int_{G_{fin}} f + g 
    \;=\; 
  \int_{G_{fin}} f + \int_{G_{fin}} g 
  \;\;\;\;
  \forall f, g \in C(G_{fin}) 
$$
$$
  \int_{G_{fin}} a f 
    \;=\; 
   a \int_{G_{fin}} f 
  \;\;\;\;
   \forall f \in C(G_{fin}) \forall a \in R
$$
$$
  \int_{G_{fin}} f^g 
    \;=\; 
  \int_{G_{fin}} f \forall f \in C(G_{fin}) 
  \;\;\;\forall g \in G
$$
$$
  \int_{G_{fin}} f \geq 0 
  \;\;\text{when}\; 
  f \geq 0 
  \;\;\;\forall f \in C(G_{fin}) 
  \,.
$$

What corresponds to the Haar measure on $G$ is simply [[cardinality]] (though we must appropriately divide by the cardinality of $G$, to get a function $\mu_{fin} \colon P(G) \rightarrow R$ from the [[power set]] of $G$ to $R$ sending $S$ to $\frac{|S|}{|G|}$).

Using the Haar integral, we may define [[convolution product]]: $\ast \colon C(G \times G) \rightarrow C(G)$ sending $f \colon G \times G \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ to the map $G \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ sending $\int_{h \in G} f(g h^{-1}, h) = \int_{h k = g} f(h, k)$. This is analogous to the map $\ast_{fin} \colon C(G_{fin} \times G_{fin}) \rightarrow C(G_{fin})$ sending $f$ to the map $C(G_{fin} )$ sending $g$ to $\frac{1}{|G_{fin}|} \sum_{h k = g} f(h, k)$.

In both cases, we get a "[[bar construction]]". For the compact Hausdorff case, we get:
$$
    \cdots 
   \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow}}
   C(G  \times G)
    \underoverset
      {
         f 
           \mapsto 
         \big( g \mapsto \int_{h \in G} f( g, h) \big)      
      }
      {\ast}
      {\rightrightarrows}
  C(G) 
    \stackrel{\int_G}{\longrightarrow} 
  \mathbb{R}
$$
and for the finite case, we get:
$$
    \cdots
    \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow}}
   C(G_{fin}  \times G_{fin})
   \underoverset
     {
         f \mapsto 
         \big( 
             g 
               \mapsto  
             \frac{1}{|G_{fin}|} 
             \sum_{h \in G} f(g, h) 
         \big)  
     }
     {\ast_{fin}}
     {\rightrightarrows}
    C(G_{fin}) 
      \stackrel{f \mapsto \frac{1}{|G_{fin}|} \sum_{g \in G} f(g)}{\longrightarrow} 
    \mathbb{R}
  \,.
$$

Beware that calling this a *bar resolution* is a slight abuse of terminology; the would-be [[monad]] involved actually has no [[unit of a monad|unit]], as $C(G)$ has no unit for the [[convolution product]]. However, convolution makes $C(G)$ an assocciative nonunitial algebra, so that the resolution is still a _unitless_ monad. Hence there are evident [[face maps]] without [[degeneracy map|degeneracies]].

While $C(G)$ has no unit, there is a canonical way of adjoining units to it: take products with $\mathbb{R}[G]$. Write $\sum_{g \in G} a_g \delta_g$ for the elements of $\mathbb{R}[G]$; since $\delta_1$ is a formal unit for convolution, we may think of it as a [[Dirac delta distribution]]. Now the bar resolution
$$
    \cdots
    \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow}}
   C(G  \times G) \prod \mathbb{R}[G]
   \underoverset
     {
       f 
         \mapsto 
       \big( 
         g 
           \mapsto 
         \int_{h \in G} f(g, h) 
       \big)   
     }
     {\ast}
     {\rightrightarrows}
    C(G) \prod \mathbb{R}[G] 
     \stackrel{\int_G}{\longrightarrow} 
   \mathbb{R}
$$
has degeneracies as well.


## Properties

### Existence and Uniqueness

Any locally compact Hausdorff topological group $G$ admits a Haar integral (and therefore Haar measure) that is unique up to scalar multiple. This result was first proven by [[Andr√© Weil]]. Proofs may be found in [Alfsen 1963](#Alfsen63) ([[constructive mathematics|consructive]]) and [Rubinstein-Salzedo 2004](#Rubinstein-Salzedo04). 
 
We here give a lesser known proof of the existence of the Haar integral, specifically on compact Hausdorff groups $G$, which uses [[convex sets]] and the Krein Milman theorem instead of [[measure theory]]. Let $G \text{-}Ban$ be the category of Banach representations of $G$ (see above *[Analogy with the Finite Case](AnalogyWithTheFiniteCase)*).

$C_c(G) = C(G)$ is such a Banach representation. We may view $\mathbb{R}$ as a Banach representation of $G$ as well, where $g z = z$ for each $z \in \mathbb{R}$ and each $g \in G$. $\mathbb{R}$ embeds into $C(G)$ as constant functions. We may then consider the exact sequence
$$
  0 \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \rightarrow C(G) \rightarrow C(G)/ \mathbb{R} \rightarrow 0
  \,.
$$

A Haar integral on the $G$-representation $C(G)$ is equivalently a retract $\int_G : C(G) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ for the injection $\mathbb{R} \rightarrow C(G)$. In other words, it is a function $\int_G : C(G) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that

$$ 
  \int_G (f_1 + f_2) 
    \;=\; 
  \int_G f_1 + \int_G f_2  
  \;\;\;\;\forall f_1, f_2 \in C(G)
$$
$$ 
  \int_G a f 
    \;=\; 
  a \int_G f   
  \;\;\;\; \forall f \in C(G), a \in \mathbb{R}
$$
$$ 
  \int_G f^g 
    \;=\; 
  \int_G f 
  \;\;\;\;\forall f \in C(G), g \in G
$$
$$ 
  \exists C \in  \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0 } 
   \;\colon\;  
   \big\Vert \textstyle{\int_G} f \big\Vert 
     \leq 
   C \int_G \Vert f \Vert
  \;\;\;\forall  
  [G, \mathbb{C}]_{\text{Top}}
  \,.
$$
The last of these requirements, given the others, is equivalent to continuity of $\int_G$.

In some sense, we might wish to show that $\text{Ext}^1_{G \text{-}Ban}\big(C(G), \mathbb{R}\big)$ vanishes; this would show that the sequence
$$
  0 \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \rightarrow C(G) \rightarrow C(G)/ \mathbb{R} \rightarrow 0
$$
[[split exact sequence|splits]] by the usual characterization of [[extensions]] via [[Ext|$\text{Ext}^1$]]. On further contemplation, it is sufficient to show that the trivial $G$-representation $\mathbb{R}$ is an [[injective object]] in $G \text{-}Ban$. This could be seen as an equivariant [[Hahn-Banach theorem]].


\begin{proof}
We show that $\mathbb{R}$ is an [[injective object]] in $G \text{-}Ban$. Take an injection of Banach representations of $G$, $X \rightarrow Y$. Let $f : X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a map of Banach representations of $G$. By the (usual) Hahn-Banach theorem, there exists a map $g \colon Y \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ in the category of Banach spaces and short maps extending $f$, though it may lack $G$-invariance.

Consider the subset of all extensions of $f$ to $Y$. Let $S$ be the collection of $G$-invariant compact convex subsets of this set. $S$ contains the convex hull of $G g$, where $g$ is some chosen extension of $f$ to $Y$, so $S$ is nonempty. Using compactness and [[Zorn's Lemma]], we may find a minimal element of $S$ in this collection, where $S$ is ordered where $A \leq B$ when $A \subset B$. Call this element $H$. $H$ must be a singleton. If $H$ contains a point which is not extremal then it contains the [[convex hull]] of the orbit of that point, which would be a proper $G$-invariant compact convex subset of $H$.

To see this, consider two theorems from functional analysis:

(1) The Krein-Smulyan theorem is that the convex hull of a compact convex subset of a Banach space $V$ is compact in its weak topology. This applies taking $V$ to be $C^0(G)^*$.

(2) The  Krein-Milman theorem is that a compact convex subset $K$ of a locally convex topological vector space $V$ is the convex hull of its extreme points. This applies taking $V$ to be the Banach space $C^0(G)^*$. 

Therefore $H$ is a [[singleton]], and its unique element is a $G$-invariant functional extending $f$.

In particular, since $\mathbb{R}$ has been shown to be injective, the map $\text{Id}_{\mathbb{R}}  : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ lifts along the inclusion
$$
  0 \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \rightarrow C(G)
$$
giving a [[retract]] $\int_G \colon C(G) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ for $0 \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \rightarrow C(G)$ in $G \text{-Ban}$.

It follows that $\int_G$ has norm $1$, and from this positivity follows immediately.
\end{proof}


### Extensive and Intensive Properties

In Lawvere's thinking about [extensive and intensive quantities](intensive+or+extensive+quantity),
 
* $C(G)$ is a space of _intensive quantities_ on $G$.

* $[C(G), \mathbb{R}]_{\text{Ban}}$ is the space of _extensive quantities_ on $X$, where $\text{Ban}$ is the category of Banach spaces with bounded maps as maps. The Haar integral is the unique $G$-invariant element of this space of norm $1$.

* the [[integration]] map is the canonical [[evaluation]] pairing

  $$
    \int_G \;\colon\; C(G) \times [C(G), \mathbb{R}]_{\text{Ban}}  \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}
    \,.
  $$

If we suggestively write $\int_G f d \phi$ for $\int_G (f, \phi) = \phi(f)$, then $\int_G - d \phi$ becomes a way of writing $\phi$. In particular, choosing $\phi$ to be the Haar measure, we can write $\phi$ as $\int_G - d \phi$.

## Left and Right Haar Measures that Differ

The left and the right Haar measure may or may not coincide, groups for which they coincide are called **unimodular**.
Consider the matrix subgroup
$$
G := \left\{ \left.\, \begin{pmatrix} y & x \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}\,\right|\, x, y \in \mathbb{R}, y \gt 0  \right\}
$$
The left and right invariant measures are, respectively,
$$
  \mu_L = y^{-2} \,\mathrm{d}x \,\mathrm{d}y,\quad   \mu_R = y^{-1} \,\mathrm{d}x \,\mathrm{d}y
$$
and so G is not unimodular.

[[Abelian groups]] are obviously unimodular; so are [[compactum|compact]] groups and [[discrete topology|discrete]] groups.
