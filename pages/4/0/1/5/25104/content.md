## Young's inequality for products

\begin{proposition}

Given

* $a, \,b \,\in\, \mathbb{R}_{\gt 0}$, non-[[negative number|negative]] [[real numbers]];

* $p, \, q \,\in\, \mathbb{R}_{\gt 1}$ such that

  $$
    \frac{1}{p}
    +
    \frac{1}{q}
    =
    1
  $$

then the following [[inequality]] holds:

$$
  a b
  \;\leq\;
  \frac{a^p}{p}
  +
  \frac{b^q}{q}
  \,,
$$

which is an [[equality]] if and only if $a^p = b^q$.

\end{proposition}
