## Idea

An interesting subclass of [[quantum field theory|quantum field theories]] is thought to arise from some kind of process that reads in certain -- usually [[differential geometry|differential geometric]] -- data, interprets this data as specifying the dynamics of some physical system, and spits out the [[quantum field theory]] that encodes the time evolution of this system.

Historically, it was an approximation to the true time evolution that was originally found and studied, by Newton, Maxwell, Einstein and others. This is now known as "[[classical physics]]". The true dynamics in turn is "quantum physics".

In view of this, quantization is often understood as a [[retraction|right inverse]] to the procedure that sends the full quantum dynamics to its [[classical limit]].
