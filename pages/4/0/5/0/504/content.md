
A **bijection** is an [[isomorphism]] in [[Set]].  

Since [[Set]] is a [[balanced category]], bijections can also be characterized as functions which are both [[injection|injective]] ([[monomorphism|monic]]) and [[surjection|surjective]] ([[epimorphism|epic]]).

In older literature, a bijection may be called a __one-to-one correspondence__, or (as a compromise) __bijective correspondence__.
