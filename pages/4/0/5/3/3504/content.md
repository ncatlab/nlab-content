## Idea

The application of mathematics in the theory of music in the west is generally attributed to start with Pythagoras and progress though the works of Euler, Mersenne, Helmholtz, and others. Recently, **mathematical music theory** has gained impetus through, among others, the Neo-Riemannian theory of harmony. David Lewin's research on transformational theory, and Guerino Mazzola's application of topos.  All of these viewpoints have greatly enhanced the variety of mathematical concepts employed in the study of music that today include tools from [[set]], [[group]], [[cyclic]] and [[topos|topos theory]].
