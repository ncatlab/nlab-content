## Idea

A _spherical space form_ is a [[quotient space]] $S^n/G$ of a [[round sphere|round]] [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian]] [[n-sphere]] ($n \geq 2$) by a [[subgroup]] $G$ of its [[isometry group]], which [[action|acts]] [[free action|freely]] and [[properly discontinuous action|properly discontinuously]]. 

Equivalently, a spherical space form is a [[Riemannian manifold]] of [[constant function|constant]] [[positive number|positive]] [[sectional curvature]] (an [[elliptic geometry]]) which is [[connected topological space|connected]] and [[geodesically complete Riemannian manifold|geodesically complete]] (see e.g. [Gadhia 07, Lemma 5](#Gadhia07)).

The spherical space forms are one of three classical examples of _[[Clifford-Klein space forms]]_.

Their classification was raised as an open problem by [Killing 1891](#Killing1891) and a complete solution was finally compiled by ([Wolf 74](#Wolf74)) (reviewed in [Gadhia 07, section 2.2](#Gadhia07)). A re-proof of the classification is claimed in ([Allock 15](#Allock15)). 


For more on this see at _[[group actions on n-spheres]]_.


## Examples

### 7-dim spherical space forms with $Spin$-structure
 {#7DSphericalSpaceFormsWithSpinStructure}

For $n =7$ all the groups $G$ in [Wolf's classification](#Wolf74) [[action|act]] as [[subgroups]] of [[special orthogonal group|SO(8)]], the latter equipped with its defining action on $\mathbb{R}^8$ restricted to the action on $S^7 = S(\mathbb{R}^8) \subset \mathbb{R}^8$.

Therefore one may consider the [[lift]] $\widehat{G}$ of these [[subgroups]] to subgroups of the [[spin group]] $Spin(8) \to SO(8)$ through the [[double cover]]-projection. Such a lift corresponds to a choice of [[spin structure]] on the [[spherical space form]] $S^7/G$.  These Spin-lifts $\widehat{G}$, have been classified in ([Gadhia 07](#Gadhia07)).

Given any such lift $\widehat{G} \subset Spin(8)$, one may consider its [[action|action]] on the two [[irreducible representation|irreducible]] [[real spin representations]] $\mathbf{8}_\pm$ of $Spin(8)$. Write

$$
  N_\pm \;\coloneqq\; dim_{\mathbb{R}}\left( \left(\mathbf{8}_{\pm}\right)^{\widehat{G}} \right)
$$

for the [[dimension]] of the subspace of [[spinors]] that are [[fixed point|fixed]] by the action of $\widehat{G}$. For $\widehat{G}$ non-[[trivial group|trivial]], we have 

$$
  (N_+, N_-) = (N,0)
  \phantom{AA} \text{or} \phantom{AA} 
  (N_+, N_-) = (0,N)
$$

and hence up to a choice of [[orientation]] there is a unique 

$$
  N \in \{0,1,\cdots, 8\}
$$

associated with each 7-dimensional [[spherical space form]] equipped with [[spin structure]].

Hence this allows to stratify [Wolf's classification](#Wolf74) of 7-dimensional spherical space forms, first into the cases that do and that do not admit any [[spin structure]], and then the former further into the dimension $N$ of the space of [[Killing spinors]] that they carry.

It turns out that the resulting sub-classification **for $N \geq 4$** demands $\widehat{G}$ to be a [[finite subgroup of SU(2)]]; hence this is an [[ADE classification]] ([MFFGME 09, Sections 3-7](#MFFGME09)):

* $N = 8$: here $\widehat{G} = \mathbb{Z}/2$, the [[cyclic group of order 2]];

* $N = 7$: does not occur;

* $N = 6$: here $\widehat{G} = \mathbb{Z}/k$ (for $k \gt 2)$, a [[cyclic group]];

* $N = 5$: here $\widehat{G} = $ a non-[[cyclic group|cyclic]] [[finite subgroup of SU(2)]], hence a [[binary dihedral group]] or the [[binary tetrahedral group]] or [[binary octahedral group]] or [[binary icosahedral group]], [[diagonal action|acting diagonally]] on $\mathbb{R}^8 \simeq \mathbb{H} \oplus \mathbb{H}$;

* $N = 4$: here $\widehat{G} = $ any [[finite subgroup of SU(2)]] _except_ the [[binary tetrahedral groups]], but acting via the [[diagonal action]] composed with a suitable non-trivial [[outer automorphism]] of $\widehat{G}$ on one of the two sides.

(In the last case, while there is one nontrivial outer automorphism of the binary tetrahedral group, its twisted action yields $N =5$, hence is equivalent to one of the previous cases ([MFFGME 09, section 7.3](#MFFGME09)).)

|---------|----------------------------------------------|------|

This analysis applies to the classification of the [[near horizon geometry]] of smooth (i.e. non-[[orbifold]]) $\geq \tfrac{1}{2}$ [[BPS state|BPS]] [[black brane|black]] [[M2-brane]]-solutions of the [[equations of motion]] of [[11-dimensional supergravity]]:

These are the [[Cartesian product]] $AdS_4 \times (S^7/G)$ of 4-[[dimension|dimensional]] [[anti de Sitter spacetime]] with a 7-[[dimension|dimensional]] [[spherical space form]] $S^7/G$ with [[spin structure]] and $N \geq 4$, as above ([MFFGME 09](#MFFGME09)).
