## Idea

An _exotic smooth structure_ is, roughly speaking, a [[smooth structure]] on a [[topological manifold]] $X$ which makes the resulting [[smooth manifold]] be [[diffeomorphism|non-diffeomorphic]] to the smooth manifold given by some evident 'standard' smooth structure on $X$. 

Milnor (1956) gave the first examples of exotic smooth structures on the 7-[[sphere]], finding at least seven. Note that spheres inherit a canonical smooth structure from their canonical (topological) embedding into a [[Cartesian space]] $S^n \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$.

Note that there exist uncountably many exotic smooth structures on $\mathbb{R}^4$ (Taubes, Donaldson, Freedman-Kirby - years?), but a unique smooth structure on $\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n\neq 4$. There is a unique maximal exotic $\mathbb{R}^4$ into which all other 'versions' of $\mathbb{R}^4$ smoothly embed as open subsets.

Moise (year?) proved that in dimension 3 there are no exotic differentiable structures, or to put in another way, 3-dimensional differentiable manifolds which are [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] are [[diffeomorphism|diffeomorphic]]. In this way the 3-sphere $S^3$ inherits a unique differentiable structure, no matter which $\mathbb{R}^4$ it is considered to be embedded in.

### In applications to physics

A survey of the application to [[physics]] is in

#### General relativity

Brans was the first who considered exotic $4$-manifolds from the [[general relativity]] point of view:

* [[Carl Brans]], [[Duane Randall]] _Exotic differentiable structures and general relativity_ Gen. Rel. Grav., 25 (1993) 205--220

* [[Carl Brans]] _Exotic smoothness and physics_ J. Math. Phys. 35, (1994), 5494--5506.

The following paper contained a first proof to localize exotic smoothness in an exotic $\mathbb{R}^4$:

* [[Carl Brans]] _Localized exotic smoothness_ Class. Quant. Grav., 11, (1994), 1785--1792.

A more philosohphical discussion can be found in:

* [[Carl Brans]] _Absolulte spacetime: the twentieth century ether_ Gen. Rel. Grav. 31, (1999),  597--609



#### Generation of source terms (fields)

Brans conjectured in the papers above, that exotic smoothness should be a source of an additional [[gravity|gravitational field]] (Brans conjecture). This conjecture was confirmed for compact $4$-manifolds (using implicitly a mapping of basic classes):

* [[Torsten Asselmeyer]] _Generation of source terms in general relativity by differential structures_ Class. Quant. Grav. 14, (1996), 749--758

Using the invariant of L. Taylor [arXiv](http://de.arxiv.org/abs/math/9807143), Sladkowski confirmed the conjecture for the exotic $\mathbb{R}^4$ in:

* [[Jan Sładkowski]] _Gravity on exotic R4 with few symmetries_ Int.J. Mod. Phys. D, 10, (2001) 311--313

Via a detailed analysis of the Casson handle (as the main object to construct exotic smoothness for $4$-manifolds via the Akbulut cork), it is possible to get the action of Dirac field and of the gauge bosons from the [[Einstein-Hilbert action]] (witha boundary term) in:

* [[Torsten Asselmeyer-Maluga]], [[Helge Rose']] _On the geometrization of matter by exotic smoothness_, [arXiv:1006.2230](http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.2230)



#### Gerbes, WZW models, foliations

The first paper describes a construction of an exotic $\mathbb{R}^4$ via a codimension-$1$ foliation of a homology $3$-sphere in the interior (classified by the Godbillon--Vey invariant). One of the results is a charge quantization without a monopole:

* [[Torsten Asselmeyer-Maluga]], [[Jerzy Król]] _Gerbes, SU(2) WZW models and exotic smooth $\mathbb{R}^4$_ [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.1276)

Then one gets various relations to [[orbifold]]s and the [[WZW model]] (level of the conformal field theory)

* [[Torsten Asselmeyer-Maluga]], [[Jerzy Król]] _Gerbes on orbifolds and exotic smooth $\mathbb{R}^4$_ [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.0271)


#### Quantum (field) theory

The first real connection between exotic smoothness and [[quantum field theory]] is Wittens TQFT:

* [[Edward Witten]], _Topological quantum field theory_ Comm. Math. Phys., 117, (1988), 353--386.

and the whole work of Seiberg and Witten leading to the celebrated invariants.

The first conjectured (direct) relation (identifying submanifolds with operators) to [[quantum mechanics]] (using singular connections) was established here:

* [[Torsten Asselmeyer-Maluga]], [[Helge Rose']] _Differential Structures -- the Geometrization of Quantum Mechanics_ [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0511089)

Using the relation to foliations and [[noncommutative geometry]] for the leave space, one can reproduce the vacuum sector of a QFT (the [[von Neumann algebra factor|factor]] $III_1$) via exotic smoothness as explained here:

* [[Torsten Asselmeyer-Maluga]], [[Jerzy Król]] _Exotic smooth $\mathbb{R}^4$, noncommutative algebras and quantization_ [arXiv](http://arxiv.org
/abs/1001.0882)

#### String theory

An argument for interpreting exotic smooth spheres as [[gravitational instanton]]s and to cancel the gravitational anomalies of [[string theory]] is in

* [[Edward Witten]], _Global gravitational anomalies_ Comm. Math. Phys. Volume 100, Number 2 (1985), 197--229.  ([web](http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.cmp/1103943444))

The influence of exotic smoothness for [[Kaluza-Klein model]]s was discussed here:

* [[Matthias Kreck]], [[Stefan Stolz]], _A diffeomorphism classification of $7$-dimensional homogeneous Einstein manifolds with $\mathfrak{su}(3) \times \mathfrak{su}(2) \times \mathfrak{u}(1)$-symmetry_ Ann. Math. 127, (1988), 373--388.

A discussion of topological effects (also of string theory) in relation to exotic smoothness is in

* [[Ryan Rohm]], _Topological Defects and Differential Structures_ Annals Of Physics, 189, (1989), 223--239.

There are also some relations between string backgrounds, quantum [[D-brane]]s and exotic $\mathbb{R}^4$

#### Cosmology

The first idea to use exotic smoothness to explain some cosmological anomalies (dark energy etc.) can be found here:

* [[Carl Brans]], [[Torsten Asselmeyer-Maluga]] Cosmological anomalies and exotic smoothness structures, Gen. Rel. Grav. 34, (2002), 597--607.

Then this idea was used to discuss a model of the cosmos including the cosmological constant (only the todays value of the constant can be reproduced, no explaination of the scaling behavior!):
