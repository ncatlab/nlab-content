### In applications to physics

A survey is in 

* [[Torsten Asselmeyer-Maluga]], [[Carl Brans]], _Exotic smoothness and physics. Differential topology and spacetime models_ Singapore: World Scientific (2007) ([ZMATH](http://www.zentralblatt-math.org/zmath/en/advanced/?q=an:1177.83001&format=complete))


#### String theory

An argument for interpreting exotic smooth spheres as [[gravitational instanton]]s and to cancel the gravitational anomalies of superstring theory is in

* [[Edward Witten]], _Global gravitational anomalies_ Comm. Math. Phys. Volume 100, Number 2 (1985), 197--229.  ([web](http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.cmp/1103943444))

The influence of exotic smoothness for Kaluza--Klein models was discussed here:

* [[Matthias Kreck]], [[Stefan Stolz]], _A diffeomorphism classification of $7$-dimensional homogeneous Einstein manifolds with $\mathfrak{su}(3) \times \mathfrak{su}(2) \times \mathfrak{u}(1)$-symmetry_ Ann. Math. 127, (1988), 373--388.

A discussion of topological effects (also of string theory) in relation to exotic smoothness is in

* [[Ryan Rohm]], _Topological Defects and Differential Structures_ Annals Of Physics, 189, (1989), 223--239.

There are also some relations between string backgrounds, quantum D-branes and exotic $\mathbb{R}^4$

* [[Torsten Asselmeyer-Maluga]], [[Jerzy Król]] _Exotic smooth $\mathbb{R}^4$, geometry of string backgrounds and quantum D-branes_, [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.2642)


#### General relativity

Brans was the first who considered exotic $4$-manifolds from the general relativity point of view:

* [[Carl Brans]], [[Duane Randall]] _Exotic differentiable structures and general relativity_ Gen. Rel. Grav., 25 (1993) 205--220

* [[Carl Brans]] _Exotic smoothness and physics_ J. Math. Phys. 35, (1994), 5494--5506.

The following paper contained a first proof to localize exotic smoothness in an exotic $\mathbb{R}^4$:

* [[Carl Brans]] _Localized exotic smoothness_ Class. Quant. Grav., 11, (1994), 1785--1792.

A more philosohphical discussion can be found in:

* [[Carl Brans]] _Absolulte spacetime: the twentieth century ether_ Gen. Rel. Grav. 31, (1999),  597--609


#### Generation of source terms (fields)

Brans conjectured in the papers above, that exotic smoothness should be a source of an additional gravitational field (Brans conjecture). This conjecture was confirmed for compact $4$-manifolds (using implicitly a mapping of basic classes):

* [[Torsten Asselmeyer]] _Generation of source terms in general relativity by differential structures_ Class. Quant. Grav. 14, (1996), 749--758

Using the invariant of L. Taylor [arXiv](http://de.arxiv.org/abs/math/9807143), Sladkowski confirmed the conjecture for the exotic $\mathbb{R}^4$ in:

* [[Jan S?adkowski]] _Gravity on exotic R4 with few symmetries_ Int.J. Mod. Phys. D, 10, (2001) 311--313

Via a detailed analysis of the Casson handle (as the main object to construct exotic smoothness for $4$-manifolds via the Akbulut cork), it is possible to get the action of Dirac field and of the gauge bosons from the Einstein--Hilbert action (witha boundary term) in:

* [[Torsten Asselmeyer-Maluga]], [[Helge Rose']] _On the geometrization of matter by exotic smoothness_, [arXiv:1006.2230](http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.2230)


#### Gerbes, WZW models, foliations

The first paper describes a construction of an exotic $\mathbb{R}^4$ via a codimension-$1$ foliation of a homology $3$-sphere in the interior (classified by the Godbillon--Vey invariant). One of the results is a charge quantization without a monopole:

* [[Torsten Asselmeyer-Maluga]], [[Jerzy Król]] _Gerbes, SU(2) WZW models and exotic smooth $\mathbb{R}^4$_ [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.1276)

Then one gets various relations to orbifolds and the WZW model (level of the conformal field theory)

* [[Torsten Asselmeyer-Maluga]], [[Jerzy Król]] _Gerbes on orbifolds and exotic smooth $\mathbb{R}^4$_ [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.0271)


#### Quantum (field) theory

The first real connection between exotic smoothness and QFT is Wittens TQFT:

* [[Edward Witten]], _Topological quantum field theory_ Comm. Math. Phys., 117, (1988), 353--386.

and the whole work of Seiberg and Witten leading to the celebrated invariants.

The first conjectured (direct) relation (identifying submanifolds with operators) to quantum mechanics (using singular connections) was established here:

* [[Torsten Asselmeyer-Maluga]], [[Helge Rose']] _Differential Structures -- the Geometrization of Quantum Mechanics_ [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0511089)

Using the relation to foliations and noncommutative geometry for the leave space, one can reproduce the vacuum sector of a QFT (the factor $III_1$) via exotic smoothness as explained here:

* [[Torsten Asselmeyer-Maluga]], [[Jerzy Król]] _Exotic smooth $\mathbb{R}^4$, noncommutative algebras and quantization_ [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.0882)

#### Cosmology

The first idea to use exotic smoothness to explain some cosmological anomalies (dark energy etc.) can be found here:

* [[Carl Brans]], [[Torsten Asselmeyer-Maluga]] Cosmological anomalies and exotic smoothness structures, Gen. Rel. Grav. 34, (2002), 597--607.

Then this idea was used to discuss a model of the cosmos including the cosmological constant (only the todays value of the constant can be reproduced, no explaination of the scaling behavior!):

* [[Torsten Asselmeyer-Maluga]], [[Helge Rose']] _Dark energy and $3$-manifold topology. Act. Phys. Pol., 38 (2007) 3633--3639
