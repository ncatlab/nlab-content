## Idea

An _exotic smooth structure_ is, roughly speaking, a [[smooth structure]] on a [[topological manifold]] $X$ which makes the resulting [[smooth manifold]] be [[diffeomorphism|non-diffeomorphic]] to the smooth manifold given by some evident 'standard' smooth structure on $X$. 

Mostly the term is used for smooth structures on [[Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ and on the [[n-spheres]] $S^n$, for $n \in \mathbb{N}$. The standard smooth structure on $\mathbb{R}^n$ is exhibited by the identity [[atlas]], and the standard smooth structure on $S^n$ is that given by the atlas by the two [[hemisphere]] as given by [[stereographic projection]].

For special values of $n$ there may exist smooth structure not equivalent to these. They are the _exotic smooth structures_.

A classification of [[smooth manifold|smooth]], [[piecewise-linear manifold|PL]] and [[topological manifold|topological]] structures on manifolds in dimension 5  and higher, in terms of various groups from [[algebraic topology]] (many not known) was established by [Kirby and Siebenmann (1977)](#KirbSieb) using [[obstruction theory]].



## Existence and Examples

### No exotic smooth structure in dimensions $\leq 3$

[Rado (1925)](#Rad) proved that in dimension 2 there are no exotic differentiable structures (or the uniqueness of the standard structure). The classification of 1-dimensional manifolds and the uniqueness of the smooth structure can be found in the Appendix of [Milnor (1965b)](#Milnor1965b).

[Moise (1952)](#Moise) proved that in dimension 3 there are no exotic differentiable structures, or to put in another way, 3-dimensional differentiable manifolds which are [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] are [[diffeomorphism|diffeomorphic]]. In this way the 3-sphere $S^3$ inherits a unique differentiable structure, no matter which $\mathbb{R}^4$ it is considered to be embedded in.



### No exotic Euclidean space away from dimension 4

There exists a unique smooth structure on the [[Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n\neq 4$ ([Stallings 1962](#Stallings62)). 


### Exotic Euclidean 4-space
 {#ExoticEuclideal4Space}

There exists uncountably many exotic smooth structures on the [[Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^4$ of dimension 4 ([Gompf 1985](#Gompf), [Freedman/Taylor 1986](#FreedTay), [Taubes 1987](#Taubes)). See also at _[[exotic R^4]]_.

There is a unique maximal exotic $\mathbb{R}^4$ into which all other 'versions' of $\mathbb{R}^4$ smoothly embed as open subsets (Freedman/Taylor 1986, [DeMichelis/Freedman 1992](#DeMFreed)).

There are two classes of exotic $\mathbb{R}^4$'s: large and small. A large exotic $\mathbb{R}^4$ cannot be embedded in the 4-sphere $S^4$ (Gompf 1985, Taubes 1987) whereas a small exotic $\mathbb{R}^4$ admits such an embedding (DeMichelis/Freedman 1992):

* A _large exotic $\mathbb{R}^4$_ is constructed by using the failure to smoothly split a smooth 4-manifold (the [[K3 surface]] for instance) as a [[connected sum]] of some factors (where a topological splitting exits). 

* The _small exotic $\mathbb{R}^4$_ (or _ribbon $\mathbb{R}^4$_) is constructed by using the failure of the smooth [[h-cobordism theorem]] in dimension 4 ([Donaldson 1987](#Donaldson1), [1990](#Donaldson2)). [Bizaca and Gompf (1996)](#BizGompf) are able to present an infinite handle body of a small exotic $\mathbb{R}^4$ which serve as a coordinate representation.

### Exotic 4-spheres?
 {#Exotic4Spheres}

It is open whether the [[4-sphere]] admits an exotic smooth structure. See ([Freedman-Gompf-Morrison-Walker 09](#FreedmanGompfMorrisonWalker09) for review).


### Exotic 7-sphere
 {#Exotic7Sphere}

[Milnor (1956)](#Milnor1956) gave the first examples of exotic smooth structures on the [[7-sphere]], finding at least seven. 

The [[7-spheres]] constructed in [Milnor 1956](#Milnor1956) are all examples of [[fibre bundles]] over the [[4-sphere]] $S^4$ with [[fibre]] the [[3-sphere]] $S^3$, with [[structure group]] the [[special orthogonal group]] $SO(4)$. 

By the classification of bundles on spheres via the [[clutching construction]], these correspond to [[homotopy classes]] of maps $S^3 \to SO(4)$, i.e. elements of $\pi_3(SO(4))$. From the table at [orthogonal group -- Homotopy groups](orthogonal+group#HomotopyGroups), this latter group is $\mathbb{Z}\oplus\mathbb{Z}$. Thus any such bundle can be described, up to [[isomorphism]], by a [[pair]] of [[integers]] $(n,m)$. When $n+m=1$, then one can show there is a [[Morse function]] with exactly two [[critical points]] on the total space of the bundle, and hence this 7-manifold is [[homeomorphic]] to a sphere.

The  [[fractional first Pontryagin class]] $\frac{p_1}{2} \in H^4(S^4) \simeq \mathbb{Z}$ of the bundle is given by $n-m$. Milnor constructs, using [[cobordism]] theory and [[Hirzebruch's signature theorem]] for 8-manifolds, a mod-7 diffeomorphism invariant of the manifold, so that it is standard 7-sphere precisely when $\frac{p_1}{2}^2 -1 = 0 (mod 7)$.

By using the [[connected sum]] operation, the set of smooth, non-diffeomorphic structures on the $n$-sphere has the structure of an [[abelian group]]. 
For the [[7-sphere]], it is the [[cyclic group]] $Z/{28}$ and Brieskorn (1966) found the generator $\Sigma$ so that $\underbrace{\Sigma\#\cdots\#\Sigma}_28$ is the standard sphere.

For review see for instance ([Kreck 10, chapter 19](#Kreck10), [McEnroe 15](#McEnroe15)).

### Exotic $n$-spheres for $n \geq 5$
 {#ExoticNSpheresForNGreaterThanFour}

Via the celebrated [[h cobordism theorem]] of Smale ([Smale 1962](#Smale), [Milnor 1965](#Milnor1965a)) one gets a relation between the number of smooth structures on the $n$-sphere $S^n$ (for $n \geq 5$) and the number of [[isotopy]] classes $\pi_0 (Diff(S^{n-1}))$ of the [[equator]] $S^{n-1}$. 

Then [Kervaire and Milnor (1963)](#KervMil) proved that for each $n \geq 5$ there are only finitely many exotic smooth structures on the [[n-sphere]] $S^n$ (possibly none).

By using the [[connected sum]] operation, the set of smooth, non-diffeomorphic structures on the $n$-sphere has the structure of an [[abelian group]]. 

The only odd-dimensional spheres with _no_ exotic smooth structure are the [[circle]] $S^1$, the [[3-sphere]] $S^3$, as well as $S^5$ and $S^{61}$ ([Wang-Xu 16, corollary 1.13](#WangXu16))

In the range $5 \leq n  \leq 61$ the only $n$-spheres with _no_ exotic smooth structures are $S^5$, $S^6$, $S^{12}$, $S^{56}$ and $S^{61}$ ([Wang-Xu 16, corollary 1.15](#WangXu16)).

It is conjectured that this exhausts in fact all examples of $n$-spheres without exotic smooth structure for $n \geq 5$ ([Wang-Xu 16, conjecture 1.17](#WangXu16)).

### For applications to physics
 {#ReferencesForApplicationsToPhysics}

The relevance of exotic smooth structure to [[physics]] is tantalizing but remains by and large unclear. Some of the following references probably ought to be handled with care.

#### General relativity

The original argument that exotic spheres are to be regarded as [[instantons]] of [[gravity]] is in

* {#Witten85} [[Edward Witten]], p. 12 of _Global gravitational anomalies_, Comm. Math. Phys. Volume 100, Number 2 (1985), 197--229.  ([EUCLID](http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.cmp/1103943444))

Further discussion of exotic $4$-manifolds from the [[general relativity]] point of view is in 

* [[Carl Brans]], Duane Randall, _Exotic differentiable structures and general relativity_ Gen. Rel. Grav., 25 (1993) 205--220

* [[Carl Brans]] _Exotic smoothness and physics_ J. Math. Phys. 35, (1994), 5494--5506.

The following paper contained a first proof to localize exotic smoothness in an exotic $\mathbb{R}^4$:

* [[Carl Brans]] _Localized exotic smoothness_ Class. Quant. Grav., 11, (1994), 1785--1792.

A more philosophical discussion can be found in:

* [[Carl Brans]] _Absolute spacetime: the twentieth century ether_ Gen. Rel. Grav. 31, (1999),  597--609



#### Generation of source terms (fields)

Brans conjectured in the papers above, that exotic smoothness should be a source of an additional [[gravity|gravitational field]] (Brans conjecture). This conjecture was confirmed for compact $4$-manifolds (using implicitly a mapping of basic classes):


Using the invariant of L. Taylor [arXiv](http://de.arxiv.org/abs/math/9807143), Sladkowski confirmed the conjecture for the exotic $\mathbb{R}^4$ in:

* Jan S&#322;adkowski _Gravity on exotic R4 with few symmetries_ Int.J. Mod. Phys. D, 10, (2001) 311--313



#### Quantum (field) theory

The first real connection between exotic smoothness and [[quantum field theory]] is Witten's TQFT:

* [[Edward Witten]], _Topological quantum field theory_ Comm. Math. Phys., 117, (1988), 353--386.

and the whole work of Seiberg and Witten leading to the celebrated invariants.

#### String theory
 {#ReferencesInStringTheory}

An argument for interpreting exotic smooth spheres as [[instantons]] of [[gravity]] and to cancel the gravitational anomalies of [[string theory]] is in ([Witten 85](#Witten85)).

The influence of exotic smoothness for [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|Kaluza-Klein models]] was discussed here:
