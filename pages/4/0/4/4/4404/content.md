**String theory**
An argument for interpreting exotic smooth spheres as [[gravitational instanton]]s and to cancel the gravitational anomalies of superstring theory is in

A discussion of topological effects (also of string theory) in relation to exotic smoothness is in

**General relativity**
Brans was the first who considered exotic 4-manifolds from the general relativity point of view:
