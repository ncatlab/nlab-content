## Idea

This page reviews some of the relation between the existence of [[supersymmetry|supersymmetries]] in a [[spacetime]] [[quantum field theory]] which arises as the [[effective quantum field theory]] of some [[string]] [[2d SCFT]], the special geometry of that spacetime (such as [[Calabi-Yau manifold]] structure) as well as increased [[worldsheet]] supersymmetry of the [[superstring]].

### Target space perspective

A solution to the bosonic [[Einstein equations]] of ordinary [[gravity]] -- some [[Riemannian manifold]] -- has a _global symmetry_ if it has a [[Killing vector]].

Accordingly, a configuration that solves the [[supergravity]] [[Euler-Lagrange equations]] is a _[[global supersymmetry]]_ if it has a [[Killing spinor]]: a [[covariantly constant spinor]].

(Here the notion of [[covariant derivative]] includes the usual [[Levi-Civita connection]], but also in general [[torsion]] components and contributions from other [[background gauge fields]] such as a [[Kalb-Ramond field]] and the [[RR-field]]s in [[type II string theory|type II supergravity]] or [[heterotic string theory|heterotic supergravity]].)

Of particular interest to phenomenologists around the turn of the millenium (but maybe less so today with new experimental evidence) has been in [[KK-compactification]] solutions of [[spacetime]] manifolds of the form $M^4 \times Y^6$ for $M^4$ the locally observed [[Minkowski spacetime]] (that plays a role as the background for all available particle accelerator experiments) and a small [[closed manifold|closed]] 6-dimensional [[Riemannian manifold]] $Y^6$. 

In the absence of further fields besides gravity, the condition that such a configuration has precisely one [[Killing spinor]] and hence precisely one [[global supersymmetry]] turns out to tbe precisely that $Y^6$ is a [[Calabi-Yau manifold]]. One such remaining global supersymmetry in the lowe energy [[effective field theory]] in 4-dimensions is or was believed to be of relevance in [[phenomenology]], see for instance the supersymmetric _[[MSSM]]_ extension of the [[standard model of particle physics]]. This is where all the interest into these Calaboi-Yau manifolds in [[string theory]] comes from. (Notice though that nothing in the theory itself demands such a compactification. It is only the phenomenological assumption of the factorized spacetime compactification together with $N = 1$ supersymmetry that does so).

More generally, in the presence of other [[background gauge fields]], the Calabi-Yau condition here is deformed. One also speaks of [[generalized Calabi-Yau space]]s. (For instance ([GMPT05](#GMPT))).

Alternatively, if one starts the [[KK-compactification]] not from 10-dimensional [[string theory]] but from [[11-dimensional supergravity]]/[[M-theory]], then the condition for the [[KK-compactification]] to preserved precisely one global supersymmetry is that it be on a [[G2-manifold]]. For more on this see at _[[M-theory on G2-manifolds]]_.

### Worldvolume perspective
 {#WorldvolumePerspective}

On the other hand, the enhanced [[supersymmetry]] of [[target space]] is also reflected in enhanced supersymmetry on the [[worldsheet]] of the string. For instance for the [[heterotic string]] whose worlsheet [[2d SCFT]] apriori has $N=(1,0)$ supersymmetry, the target space theory has $N=1$ supersymmetry precisely if the worldsheet theory's supersymmetry enhanced to $N=(2,0)$. ([BDFF 88](#BDFF88)). For more on this see at _[[2d (2,0)-superconformal QFT]]_.

Similar comments apply to [[type II superstring theory]], where $N=1$ target space supersymmetry enhanced the worldheet symmetry from $N=(1,1)$ to $N=(2,2)$. This is reflected notably in the [[mirror symmetry]] of the targt Calabi-Yau manifolds.
