Sometimes, late at night, when everyone is asleep, the lab elves come by and clean up [[HomePage|the wiki]].  They add links from one page to another, fix the formatting, debug the iTeX.  (If things get really bad, they can even [[reality check|reboot reality]].)  You can help them by proofreading your material and fixing it (if you can) or making a note of what\'s wrong (if you can\'t).  But don\'t worry about it very much; the lab elves will come by and make everything all right.

Anybody can be a lab elf, and most lab elves sign their own names.  Edits attributed to 'lab elf' are usually done by [[Andrew Stacey]] (I think), but who knows?

Some lab elves have handy superpowers to edit the options on webs and create new ones; at the moment, these are [[Andrew Stacey]], [[Toby Bartels]], and [[Urs Schreiber]].
