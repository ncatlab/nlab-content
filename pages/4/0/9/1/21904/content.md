## Idea

Given an [[algebraic variety]], its _canonical divisor_ is the [[divisor (algebraic geometry)|divisor]] corresponding to  its [[canonical line bundle]].

Similarly, its _anticanonical divisor_ is the additive inverse of the canonical divisor in the group of divisors, hence the divisor corresponding to the [[anticanonical line bundle]].
