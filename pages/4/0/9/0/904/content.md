The fundamental group $\pi_1(X,a)$ of a pointed space $(X,a)$ is the group of [[loop]]s at $x$ ([[path]]s from $x$ to $x$), with multiplication defined by concatenation (following one path by another).  As concatenation is not actually associative, we have to define things up to homotopy, but it works out.

For a (path)-[[connected space]], all of the fundamental groups are isomorphic, no matter which point is chosen, so one sometimes speaks of 'the' fundamental group of a connected space.  However, this does not follow the yoga of the [[generalized the]], so careful description of the functors involved still requires using a pointed space.

The fundamental group $\pi_1(X,a)$ generalises in one direction to the [[fundamental groupoid]] $\Pi_1(X)$, or in another direction to the [[homotopy group]]s $\pi_n(X,a)$.  (Ultimately, all of this should be contained within the [[fundamental infinity-groupoid]] $\Pi(X)$.)
