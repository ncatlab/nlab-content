## Idea

In type theory, a 1-truncated type with a binary operation. In category theory, the [[groupoidal categorification]] of a [[magma]]. 

## Definitions

### In type theory

In [[intensional type theory]] with [[function extensionality]], a [[groupoid]] is a [[n-truncated|1-truncated]] [[type]] and a __binary operation__ on a [[groupoid]] $G$ is a [[function]] $(-)\otimes (-) \colon G \times G \to G$ from the [[product type|product groupoid]] $G \times G$ to $G$. A __magmoidal groupoid__ $(G,\otimes)$ is a [[groupoid]] equipped with a binary operation on it. 

### In category theory

In [[category theory]], a [[groupoid]] is a [[dagger category]] where every [[morphism]] is [[unitary morphism|unitary]], and a __binary operation__ on a [[groupoid]] $G$ is a [[dagger functor]] $(-)\otimes (-) \colon G \times G \to G$ from the [[product groupoid]] $G \times G$ to $G$. A __magmoidal groupoid__ $(G,\otimes)$ is a [[groupoid]] equipped with a binary operation on it.
