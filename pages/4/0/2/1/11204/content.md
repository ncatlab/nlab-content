## Idea

What is called _Weihrauch's Type-2 Theory_ ([Weihrauch 87](#Weihrauch87)) is a measure for the complexity of [[computable functions]] on non-[[discrete spaces|discrete]] [[topological spaces]] such as the [[real line]], the topic of [[computable analysis]]. While some approaches to [[computability]] of [[continuous functions]] take pointwise addition as an elementary operation, Weihrauch's Type-2 theory is instead "bit oriented" and takes into account the finitary aspects of [[computation]].

A quick survey is in the beginning of ([Schr&#246;der 04](#Schroeder04)).
