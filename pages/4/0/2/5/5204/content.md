A **PIE-limit** is a [[strict 2-limit]] which can be constructed from strict [[cartesian product|products]], [[strict inserters]], and [[strict equifiers]].  Any PIE-limit is in particular a [[flexible limit]], and therefore also a (non-strict) [[2-limit]].

Furthermore, all [[strict pseudo-limits]] are PIE-limits, and therefore any [[strict 2-category]] which admits all PIE-limits also admist all non-strict 2-limits, although it may not have all strict 2-limits.  This is the case, for instance, for the 2-category of strict algebras and pseudo morphisms over a [[strict 2-monad]].
