## Idea

Various concepts from [[logic]] have corresponding concepts from [[set theory]]: [[proposition]]s and [[predicate]]s correspond to [[set]]s and [[family|families]], [[true]] and [[false]] correspond to [[singleton]] and [[empty set]], [[conjunction]] and [[disjunction]] correspond to to [[cartesian product]] and [[disjoint union]], and so on. The same should be true of higher-order predicates in [[higher-order logic]], which should have a corresponding concept of higher-order families in some notion of higher-order set theory. 

Thus, a higher-order set theory is any [[set theory]] which features higher-order [[family|families]], which are families of families. If we think of a family of sets as a [[functor]] to [[Set]], then a higher-order family is a functor on a  [[functor category|functor groupoid]] with target [[Set]]. 

Just as [[intuitionistic logic|intuitionistic]] higher-order logic is the internal logic of an elementary topos, constructive higher-order set theory is the [[internal set theory]] of an [[elementary (2,1)-topos]].
