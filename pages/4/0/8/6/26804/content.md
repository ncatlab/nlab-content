## Idea

In algebra, matrix theory, operator theory, approximation theory and some other areas where a multiplicative binary operation is defined a two-sided inverse of some elements is often either non-existent or ill-behaved, hence some generalized notion may be often useful. Generalized inverse would still retain some of the properties. 

## Examples

### Inverses in inverse semigroups

In [[inverse semigroup]]s, every element $A$ has a generalized inverse $A^{-1}$, called just an inverse in that setup, with defining properties
$$
A A^{-1} A = A
$$
$$
A^{-1} A A^{-1} = A^{-1}
$$ 

### [[Moore-Penrose inverse]]

### Using approximate unit

Some nonunital operator algebras have an approximate unit;
inverses can be defined using an approximate unit instead of the usual unit.
