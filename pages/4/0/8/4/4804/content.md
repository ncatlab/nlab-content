The _graviton_ is the quantum of the field of [[gravity]].

In [[first-order formulation of gravity]] a field configuration is locally a [[Lie algebra-valued form]]

$$
  (E, \Omega) : T X \to \mathfrak{iso}(d)
$$

with values in the [[Poincare Lie algebra]].

This is a [[vielbein]] $E$ and a [[spin connection]] $\Omega$. This together is the **graviton field**.

In [[supergravity]] this is accompanied by the [[gravitino]].
