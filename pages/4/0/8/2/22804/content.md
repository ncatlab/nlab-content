## Idea

A lattice-ordered ring is an [[partially ordered ring]] whose partial order forms a [[lattice]]. Lattices here are assumed not to have top or bottom elements, because otherwise the only such lattice-ordered ring is the [[trivial ring]]. 

## Definition

A **lattice-ordered ring** or **l-ring** is a [[preordered ring]] where the partial order $\lt$ is a [[lattice]]: it has binary [[joins]] and [[meets]]. 

If the relation $\leq$ is only a [[preorder]], then the [[preordered ring]] $R$ is said to be a **prelattice-ordered ring**. 

### Essentially algebraic definition

The following [[essentially algebraic]] definition is adapted from the algebraic definition of [[lattice-ordered abelian group]] by [[Peter Freyd]]:

A __lattice-ordered ring__ is an [[ring]] $R$ with a function $ramp:R \to R$ such that for all $a$ and $b$ in $G$,

$$
  a = ramp(a) - ramp(-a)
$$

$$
  ramp(a - ramp(b)) = ramp(ramp(a) - ramp(b))
$$

and the following [[Horn clause]]: 

$$
  ramp(a) = a \wedge ramp(b) = b \vdash ramp(a b) = a b
$$

An element $a$ in $R$ is __non-negative__ if $ramp(a) = a$. The Horn clause can then be stated as multiplication of non-negative elements is non-negative.

The [[join]] $(-)\vee(-):R \times R \to R$ is defined as

$$
  a \vee b \coloneqq a + ramp(b - a)
$$

the [[meet]] $(-)\wedge(-):R \times R \to R$ is defined as

$$
  a \wedge b \coloneqq a - ramp(a - b)
$$

and the absolute value is defined as 

$$
  \vert a \vert \coloneqq ramp(a) + ramp(-a)
$$

The order relation is defined as in all lattices: $a \leq b$ if $a = a \wedge b$. 

## Examples

All [[total order|totally ordered]] rings, such as the [[integers]], the [[rational numbers]], and the [[real numbers]], are lattice-ordered rings.
