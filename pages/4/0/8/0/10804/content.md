## Idea

A [[p-adic cohomology]] for [[varieties]] in [[characteristic]] $p$ [[crystalline cohomology]] was it was discussed in

* [[Pierre Berthelot]], _Cohomologie cristalline des sch&#233;mas de caract&#233;ristique $g \gt 0$, Lecture Notes in Mathematics, Vol. 407, Springer- Verlag, Berlin, 1974. MR 0384804

The _comparison theorem (crystalline cohomology)_ shown there (theorem V2.3.2) shows that the crystalline cohomology over $\mathbb{Z}/p$ is canonically identified with the [[de Rham cohomology]] of a lift to [[p-adic geometry]] if one exists. See also

Discussion of this in terms of [[Cech cohomology]] is in 

* [[Bhargav Bhatt]], [[Aise Johan de Jong]], _Crystalline cohomology and de Rham cohomology_ ([pdf](http://www.math.columbia.edu/~dejong/papers/crystalline-comparison.pdf))
