## Idea

The notion of _[[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal]] [[tensor category]]_ may be thought of as a [[categorification]] of the notion of  [[commutative ring]], a _2-ring_ or [[2-algebra]]. 

Now the notion of _super 2-algebra_ is accordingly supposed to be the notion categorifying [[super algebra]].

  > **Abstract:**. The "minimal sign skeleton" necessary to formulate the [[signs in supergeometry|Koszul sign rule]] is a certain [[Picard category]], a [[symmetric monoidal category]] with all [[invertible object|objects]] and [[invertible morphism|morphisms invertible]]. It can be seen as the free Picard category generated by one object and corresponds, by [[Grothendieck]]'s dictionary, to the [[n-truncation|truncation]] of the [[sphere spectrum|spherical spectrum]] $S$ in degrees 0 and 1, so that $\{\pm 1\}$ appears as the [[first stable homotopy group of spheres]] $\pi_{n+1}(S^n)$. This suggest a "[[higher structures|higher]]" or [[categorification|categorified]] versions of [[super-algebra|super-mathematics]] which utilize deeper structure of [[sphere spectrum|$S$]]. The first concept on this path is that of a supersymmetric monoidal category which is [[categorification|categorified]] version of the concept of a [[supercommutative algebra]].

(while the first 30 minutes are concerned with discussion of how super-grading is implied by grading ([[augmented infinity-groups]]) over the [[sphere spectrum]], see  at [superalgebra - Abstract idea](super+algebra#AbstractIdea)).
