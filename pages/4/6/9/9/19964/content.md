## Idea


A _Skyrmion_ is a kind of [[instanton]]/[[soliton]] in certain [[gauge field theories]]. The concept exists quite generally (see [Rho-Zahed 16](#RhoZahed16)), but its original use ([Skyrme 62](#Skyrme62)), and still one of the most important ones, is as a model for _[[baryons]]_ in a putative theory of [[non-perturbative quantum field theory|non-perturbative]] [[quantum chromodynamics]], the formulation of the latter being by and large an open problem (due to [[confinement]], see [[mass gap problem]]).

## In the Sakai-Sugimoto model

The Skyrmion model of [[baryons]] appears in the [[Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model]] for [[non-perturbative quantum field theory|non-perturbative]] [[QCD]], induced by the [[higher WZW term]] of the [[D8-brane]] ([Sakai-Sugimoto 04, section 5.2](#SakaiSugimoto04), [Sakai-Sugimoto 05, section 3.3](#SakaiSugimoto05)), and it becomes equivalent here to a model of [[baryons]] by [[wrapped brane|wrapped]] [[D4-branes]] in an [[intersecting D-brane model]] ([Sugimoto 16, 15.4.1](#Sugimoto16)).

## History

From [Rho-Zahed 10, Preface](#RhoZahed10):

> Two path-breaking developments took place consecutively in physics in the years 1983 and 1984: First in nuclear physics with the rediscovery of Skyrme’s seminal idea on the structure of baryons and then a ["revolution" in string theory](string+theory#ReferencesHistory) in the following year. 

> $[\cdots]$ at that time the most unconventional idea of Skyrme that [[fermion|fermionic]] [[baryons]] could emerge as topological [[solitons]] from [[π-meson]] cloud was confirmed in the context of [[quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD) in the large number-of-[[color charge|color]] ($N_c$) limit. It also confirmed how the solitonic structure of [[baryons]], in particular, the [[nucleons]], reconciled nuclear physics — which had been making an impressive progress [[phenomenology|phenomenologically]], aided mostly by [[experiments]] — with [[QCD]], the fundamental theory of [[strong nuclear force|strong interactions]]. Immediately after the rediscovery of what is now generically called "skyrmion" came the [first string theory revolution](string+theory#ReferencesHistory) which then took most of the principal actors who played the dominant role in reviving the skyrmion picture away from that problem and swept them into the mainstream of [[string theory]] reaching out to a much higher [[energy]] [[scale]]. This was in some sense unfortunate for the skyrmion model _per se_ but fortunate for nuclear physics, for it was then mostly nuclear theorists who picked up what was left behind in the wake of the celebrated string revolution and proceeded to uncover fascinating novel aspects of nuclear structure which otherwise would
have eluded physicists, notably concepts such as the ‘Cheshire Cat phenomenon’ in hadronic dynamics.

> What has taken place since 1983 is a beautiful story in [[physics]]. It has not only profoundly influenced nuclear physics — which was Skyrme’s original aim — but also brought to light hitherto unforseen phenomena in other areas of physics, such as [[condensed matter physics]], [[astrophysics]] and [[string theory]].
