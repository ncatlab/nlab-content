## Idea

A [[derivator]] is *pointed* if it has a [[zero object]] in the sense appropriate to a derivator.

## Definition

A derivator $D\colon Dia^{coop} \to Cat$ is **pointed**, or has a **zero object**, if each category $D(X)$ has a zero object.

By a "super-difficult" excercise in [Maltsionitis' notes](http://people.math.jussieu.fr/~maltsin/Seville/Lecture_III_Derivators.pdf), this is equivalent to requiring that whenever $u\colon I\to J$ is a [[sieve]] in $Dia$, the functor $u_! \colon D(I) \to D(J)$ has a left adjoint $u^?$, and dually whenever $u$ is a cosieve, the functor $u_*$ has a right adjoint $u^!$.
