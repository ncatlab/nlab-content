## Idea

[[type theory|Type theory]] and certain kinds of [[category theory]] are closely related.  By a [[syntax-semantics duality]], one may view type theory as a formal [[syntax|syntactic]] language, or _calculus_, for category theory, and conversely one may think of category theory as providing [[categorical semantics|semantics]] for type theory.  The flavor of category theory used depends on the flavor of type theory; this also extends to [[homotopy type theory]] and certain kinds of [[(∞,1)-category theory]].

This was originally claimed as an [[equivalence of categories]] [Seely 1974 theorem 6.3](#Seely84b). However, that argument did not properly treat a subtlety central to the whole subject: that [[substitution]] of [[terms]] for [[variables]] composes strictly, while its [[categorical semantics]] by [[pullback]] is by the [[universal construction|very nature]] of pullbacks only defined up to [[isomorphism]]. This problem was pointed out and ways to fix it were given by [Curien](#Curien) and [Hofmann](#Hofmann); see _[[categorical model of dependent types]]_ for the latter.  However, the full equivalence of categories was not recovered until [Clairambault & Dybjer](#ClairambaultDybjer) solved both problems by promoting the statement to an [[equivalence of 2-categories]], see also [Curien, Garner & Hofmann](#CurienGarnerHofmann). Another approach to this which also works with [[intensional identity types]] and hence with [[homotopy type theory]] is in [Lumsdaine & Warren 2013](#LumsdaineWarren13).

We now indicate some of the details.



#### Type theories
 {#TypeTheories}

For definiteness, self-containedness and for references below, we say what a [[dependent type theory]] is, following ([Seely, def. 1.1](#Seely)).

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A **Martin-L&#246;f [[dependent type theory]]** $T$ is a _[[theory]]_ with some [[signature (in logic)|signature]] of dependent function symbols with values in types and in terms (...) subject to the following rules

1. **type formation rules** 

   1. $1$ is a type (the [[unit type]]);
  
   1. if $a, b$ are terms of type $A$, then $(a = b)$ is a type (the [[equality type]]);

   1. if $A$ and $B[x]$ are types, $B$ depending on a [[free variable]] of type $A$, then the following symbols are types

      1. $\prod_{a : A} B[a]$ ([[dependent product]]), written also $(A \to B)$ if $B[x]$ in fact does not depend on $x$;

      1. $\sum_{a : A} B[a]$ ([[dependent sum]]), written also $A \times B$ if $B[x]$ in fact does not depend on $x$;

1. **term formation rules**

   1. $* \in 1$ is a term of the [[unit type]];

   1. (...)

1. **equality rules**

   1. (...)


=--


#### Category of contexts

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Given a [[dependent type theory]] $T$, its **[[category of contexts]]** $Con(T)$ is the category whose

* [[objects]] are the [[types]] of $T$;

* [[morphisms]] $f : A \to B$ are the [[terms]] $f$ of [[function type]] $A \to B$.

Composition is given in the evident way.
 
=--

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

$Con(T)$ has [[finite limits]] and is a [[cartesian closed category]].

=--

([Seely, prop. 3.1](#Seely))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Constructions are straightforward. We indicated some of them. 

Notice that all [[finite limits]] (as discussed there) are induced as soon as there are all [[pullbacks]] and [[equalizers]]. A [[pullback]] in $Con(T)$

$$
  \array{
    P &\to& A
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    B &\stackrel{g}{\to}& C
  }
$$

is given by 

$$
  P \simeq \sum_{a : A} \sum_{b \in B} (f(a) = g(b))
  \,.
$$

The [[equalizer]]

$$
  P \to A \stackrel{\overset{f}{\to}}{\underset{g}{\to}} B
$$

is given by

$$
  P = \sum_{a : A} (f(a) = g(a))
  \,.
$$

Next, the [[internal hom]]/[[exponential object]] is given by [[function type]]

$$
  [A,B] \simeq (A \to B)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

$Con(T)$ is a [[locally cartesian closed category]].

=--

([Seely, theorem 3.2](#Seely))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Define the $Con(T)$-[[indexed category|indexed]] [[hyperdoctrine]] $P(T)$
by taking for $A \in Con(T)$ the category $P(T)(A)$ to have as objects the $A$-[[dependent types]] and as morphisms $(a : A \vdash X(a) : type) \to (a : A \vdash Y(a) : type)$ the terms of dependent function type $(a : A \vdash t : (X(a) \to Y(a)))$.

This is cartesian closed by the same kind of argument as in the previous proof. It is now sufficient to exhibit a compatible [[equivalence of categories]] with the [[slice category]] $Con(T)_{/A}$.

$$
  Con(T)_{/A}
   \simeq
  P(T)(A)
  \,.
$$

In one direction, send a morphism $f : X \to A$ to the dependent type 

$$
  a : A \vdash f^{-1}(a) \coloneqq \sum_{x : X} (a = f(x))
  \,.
$$

Conversely, for $a : A \vdash X(a)$ a dependent type, send it to the projection
$\sum_{a : A} X(a) \to A$.

One shows that this indeed gives an equivalence of categories which is compatible with base change ([Seely, prop. 3.2.4](#Seely)).

=--

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For $T$ a dependent type theory and $C$ a locally cartesian closed category, an **[[categorical semantics|interpretation]]** of $T$ in $C$ is a morphism of locally cartesian closed categories

$$
  Con(T) \to C
  \,.
$$

An interpretation of $T$ in another dependent type theory $T'$ is a morphism of locally cartesian closed categories

$$
  Con(T) \to Con(T')
  \,.
$$

=--


#### Internal language

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Given a [[locally cartesian closed category]] $C$, define the corresponding [[dependent type theory]] $Lang(C)$ as follows

* the non-dependent types of $Lang(C)$ are the [[objects]] of $C$;

* the $A$-dependent types are the morphisms $B \to A$;

* a context $x_1 : X_1 , x_2 : X_2, \cdots , x_n : X_n$ is a tower of morphisms

  $$
    \array{
      X_n
      \\
      \downarrow
      \\
      \cdots
      \\
      \downarrow
      \\
      X_2
      \\
      \downarrow
      \\
      X_1
    }
  $$

* the terms $t[x_A] : B[x_A]$ are the [[sections]] $A \to B$ in $C_{/A}$

* the [[equality type]] $(x_A = y_A)$ is the [[diagonal]] $A \to A \times A$

* ...

### Homotopy type theory and locally cartesian closed $(\infty,1)$-categories
 {#HomotopyTypeTheory}

All of the above has an analog in [[(∞,1)-category theory]] and [[homotopy type theory]].

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

Every [[presentable (∞,1)-category|presentable]] and [[locally cartesian closed (∞,1)-category]] has a presentation by a [[type-theoretic model category]]. This provides the [[categorical semantics]] for [[homotopy type theory]] (without, possibly, the [[univalence]] [[axiom]]).

This includes in particular all ([[∞-stack]]-) [[(∞,1)-toposes]] (which should in addition satisfy [[univalence]]). See also at _[[internal logic of an (∞,1)-topos]]_.

=--

Some form of this statement was originally formally conjectured in ([Joyal 11](#Joyal11)), following ([Awodey 10](#Awodey10)). For more details see at _[locally cartesian closed (∞,1)-category](locally+cartesian+closed+%28infinity%2C1%29-category#InternalLogic)_.



### Univalent homotopy type theory and elementary $(\infty,1)$-toposes
 {#HomotopyWithUnivalence}

> For more details see *[[model of type theory in an (infinity,1)-topos]]*.

A ([[locally presentable (∞,1)-category|locally presentable]]) [[locally Cartesian closed (∞,1)-category]] (as [above](#HomotopyTypeTheory)) which in addition has a system of [[object classifiers]] is an ([[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves|(∞,1)-sheaf]]-)[[(∞,1)-topos]].

It has been conjectured in ([Awodey 10](#Awodey10)) that this [[object classifier]] is the categorical semantics of a [[univalence|univalent]] [[type universe]] ([[type of types]]), hence that [[homotopy type theory]] with [[univalence]] has categorical semantics in [[(∞,1)-toposes]].  This statement was proven for the canonical $(\infty,1)$-topos [[∞Grpd]] in ([Kapulkin-Lumsdaine-Voevodsky 12](#KapulkinLumsdaineVoevodsky12)), and more generally for [[(∞,1)-presheaf]] $(\infty,1)$-toposes over [[elegant Reedy categories]] in ([Shulman 13](#Shulman13)). The general case is proven in [Shulman 19](#Shulman19).

In these proofs the [[type-theoretic model categories]] which interpret the homotopy type theory syntax are required to provide type universes that behave strictly under pullback.  This matches the usual syntactically convenient universes in type theory (either a la Russell or a la Tarski), but more difficult to implement in the categorical semantics.  More flexibly, one may consider syntactic [type universes weakly &#224; la Tarski](type+of+types#TarskiStyle) ([Luo 12](Luo12), [Gallozzi 14](#Gallozzi14)).  These are more complicated to work with syntactically, but should have interpretations in a ([[type-theoretic model categories]] presenting) any [[(∞,1)-topos]].  Discussion of [[univalence]] in this general flexible sense is in ([Gepner-Kock 12](#GepnerKock12)). For the general syntactic issue see at 

* [[homotopytypetheory:model of type theory in an (infinity,1)-topos]]

While [[(∞,1)-sheaf]] [[(∞,1)-toposes]] are those currently understood, the basic type theory with univalent universes does not see or care about their [[locally presentable (∞,1)-category|local presentability]] as such (although it is used in other places, such as the construction of [[higher inductive types]]).  It is to be expected that there is a decent concept of [[elementary (∞,1)-topos]] such that [[homotopy type theory]] with [[univalence|univalent]] [[type universes]] and some supply of [[higher inductive types]] has categorical semantics precisely in [[elementary (∞,1)-toposes]] (as conjectured in [Awodey 10](#Awodey10)). But the fine-tuning of this statement is currently still under investigation.

Notice that this statement, once realized, makes (or would make) Univalent HoTT+HITs a sort of [[homotopy theory|homotopy theoretic]] refinement of [[foundations of mathematics]] in [[topos theory]] as proposed by [[William Lawvere]].  It could be compared to his [[elementary theory of the category of sets]], although being a type theory rather than a theory in first-order logic, it is more analogous to the internal type theory of an elementary topos.

following earlier suggestions by [[Steve Awodey]]. Explicitly, the suggestion that with the [[univalence]] axiom added this is refined to [[(∞,1)-topos theory]] appears around
