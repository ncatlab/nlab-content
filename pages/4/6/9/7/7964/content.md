## Idea

The _Higgs field_ or _[[Higgs boson]]_ is a [[scalar field|scalar]] [[physical field]]/[[fundamental particle]]  in a [[gauge theory]] such as the [[standard model of particle physics]] supposedly responsible for the [[spontaneously broken symmetry]] of the [[electroweak field]] ([[electroweak symmetry breaking]]) and for giving elementary particles their [[mass|masses]] by the _[[Higgs mechanism]]_. 

## Properties

### Mass and vacuum (in-)stability
 {#MassAndVacuumInstability}

The [[rest mass]] of the Higgs particle observed at the [[LHC]] [[experiment]] is about $125$ [[GeV]] ([ATLAS Collaboration 12](#ATLAS12), [CMS Collaboration 12](#CMS12), [ATLAS Collaboration 15](#ATLAS15), see [Gibbs 11a](#Gibbs11a), [HLL 11](#HLL11) for early discussion).

This is determined by a [[local minimum]] of the Higgs [[potential energy|potential]] (see [Kusenko 15](#Kusenko15) for exposition):

  "width": 500
\end{imagefromfile}


{#Curiously} Curiously, the Higgs [[potential energy|potential]] is such that the Higgs field at this mass is at least close to being at the border between [[vacuum stability]] and [[false vacuum]]. This was highlighted before the actual measurement ([EEGHR 09](#EEGHR09), [Gibbs 11b](#Gibbs11b)):

\end{imagefromfile}

Then it was amplified again after the detection of the Higgs particle at the [[LHC]] ([DVEEGI 12](#DVEEGI12)):

\begin{imagefromfile}
  "file_name": "HiggsVacuumStability.png",
  "width": 700
\end{imagefromfile}

More detailed computation at [[2-loop]] confirmed this result, showing that the observed Higgs vacuum is indeed very close to the boundary between the [[vacuum stability|stable]] and the meta-stable region ([BKPV 15](#BKPV15)):

\end{imagefromfile}

In summary ([Kusenko 15](#Kusenko15)):

> $[$The$]$ conclusion is that the best theoretical fit to measured parameters, including the Higgs and top-quark masses, points to a metastable Universe. However, their analysis also concludes that values of parameters are closer to a region of absolute stability than suggested by previous studies: it is possible for the Universe to be fully stable (and for the standard model to work all the way up to the Planck scale), if the true values of measured parameters are only 1.3 standard deviations away from the current best estimates.

And more recently ([PDG 18, p. 9](#PDG18)):

> {#PDG18OnVacuumMetastability} However, for the value of Higgs mass experimentally measured, the EW vacuum of the Higgs potential is most likely metastable. Indeed, the high energy evolution of $\lambda$ shows that it becomes [[negative number|negative]] at [[energies]] $\Lambda = \mathcal{O}(10^{10}-10^{12})$ [[GeV]], with a broader range if the [[top quark]] [[mass]] exceeds its current measured value by [[statistical significance|3σ]]. When this occurs, the [[standard model of particle physics|SM]] Higgs potential develops an instability and the long term existence of the [[electroweak symmetry breaking|EW]] [[vacuum]] is challenged. This behavior may call for new physics at an intermediate scale before the instability develops, i.e., below [[Planck mass|M_Planck]], otherwise, the electroweak vacuum remains metastable.

However [[quantum tunneling]]/[[vacuum decay]] is an intrinsically [[non-perturbative effect]] which needs careful treatment beyond [[perturbative quantum field theory]] (e.g. [AFFS 17](#AFFS17))

### Possible causes of the near criticality
 {#PossibleCausesOfNEarCriticality}

Given, by the [above](#MassAndVacuumInstability) discussion, that the parameters of the Higgs field are observed to be inside a special reason of their potential parameter space, it is natural to speculate that there is some mechanism that enforces or at least prefers this position.

In [BDGGSSS 13, Section 5.2](#BDGGSSS13) is speculation that for dynamics over a [[landscape of string theory vacua|landscape of vacua]] critical points may generally serve as attractors.

More specifically, [Isidori-Pattori 17](#IsidoriPattori17) claims that, under reasonable assumptions (including [[gauge coupling unification]], but excluding "[[naturalness]]") [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]]-extensions of the [[standard model of particle physics]] ([[MSSM]]) predict a parameter range for the [[top quark]] and Higgs field [[mass]] that is close to coinciding with the corresponding parameter space for Higgs field near criticality:

  "width": 600
\end{imagefromfile}
\end{center}


> graphics grabbed from [Isidori-Pattori 17](#IsidoriPattori17)

That [[supersymmetry]], possibly in a [[G2-MSSM]], would be a natural mechanism behind the near criticality of the Higgs field was also claimed in [Kane 18, "Clue 4"](#Kane18).



### Cosmological instability?
 {#CosmologicalInstability}

However, it has been argued that an actual [[false vacuum]] of the Higgs is incompatible with [[cosmology]], as due to [[vacuum fluctuations]] during [[inflation]] the [[vacuum decay]] would not have been avoided ([EGR 07](#EGR07), [HKSZ 14](#HKSZ14), [EGMRSST 15](#EGMRSST15), [EKSYZ 16](#EKSYZ16)). In ([BDGGSSS 13, section 7](#BDGGSSS13), [Kane 18 , "Clue 4"](#Kane18)) it was argued that this suggests a further principle which prevents the vacuum instability and that a natural such principle is [[supersymmetry]]. (This argument has a long history, see [Gibbs 11b](#Gibbs11b)).


### Asymptotic safety?
 {#AsymtoticSafetyOrNot}

The near criticality of the Higgs field [[vacuum]] discussed [above](#MassAndVacuumInstability) implies that the [[coefficient]] $\lambda$ of the quartic part of the Higgs potential is close to zero after [[renormalization group flow]] ("RGE") to around the [[Planck scale]] of about $10^{19}$ [[GeV]] (e.g. [BDGGSSS 13, p. 17-18](#BDGGSSS13)):

\begin{imagefromfile}
  "file_name": "HiggsQuarticCoupling.png",
  "width": 400
\end{imagefromfile}

In fact also the [[beta function]] $\beta_\lambda$ of the quartic coupling $\lambda$ (i.e. its logarithmic [[derivative]] with respect to [[scale]]) is close to zero around the [[Planck scale]] of about $10^{19}$ [[GeV]] ([BDGGSSS 13, p. 18](#BDGGSSS13)):

\begin{imagefromfile}
  "file_name": "HiggsQuarticBetaFunctionRelative.png",
  "width": 400
\end{imagefromfile}

Earlier it has been suggested that this reflects the principle of [[asymptotic safety]] ([Shaposhnikov-Wetterich 09](#ShaposhnikovWetterich09)). But this would mean that not only $\lambda$ and its [[beta function|RGE-derivative]] $\beta_\lambda$ vanish around the [[Planck scale]], but that in fact all higher derivatives do, too (see e.g. [Niedermaier 06, equation (1.5)](asymptotic+safety#Niedermaier06)) hence that $\beta_\lambda$ asymptotes to zero. But this does not seem to be the case; in ([BDGGSSS 13, p. 17-18](#BDGGSSS13)) it says:

>  As shown in fig. 2 (upper right), the corresponding Higgs quartic [[beta-function]] vanishes at a [[scale]] of about $10^{17}$-$10^{18}$ [[GeV]]. In order to quantify the degree of cancellation in the β-function, we plot in fig. 2 (lower right) $\beta_\lambda$ in units of its pure [[top quark]] contribution.  The vanishing of $\beta_\lambda$ looks  more  like  an  accidental  cancellation  between  various  large  contributions, rather than an asymptotic approach to zero.

\end{imagefromfile}


### Higgs inflation?
 {#HiggsInflation}

Starting with [Jegerlehner 13](cosmic+inflation#Jegerlehner13) has been argued that the near-criticality of the Higgs potential is in fact consistent or even necessary for [[Higgs inflation]] to be a viable model. See [Jegerlehner 18](cosmic+inflation#Jegerlehner18).



## Models

There is no lack of proposals for realizing the Higgs field in various big schemes of mathematical structures modelling physics. 

### Gauge-Higgs unification

A mechanis, of _gauge-Higgs unification_ ([Manton 79](#Manton79), [Hosotani 83](#Hosotani83)) also known as the _Hosotani mechanism_ (see [Hosotani 12](#Hosotani12)) refers to hypothetical [[model (in theoretical physics)|models]] of [[particle physics]] where the [[Higgs field]] on 4d [[spacetimes]] arises as a component of a [[gauge field]] in higher dimensions, either after [[Kaluza-Klein compactification]] or by passage to a 4d [[asymptotic boundary]] in a [[Randall-Sundrum model]] or similar.


<center>
<img src="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/GaugeHiggsUnification.jpg" width="500">
</center>

> graphics grabbed from [Lim 09](#Lim09)

Gauge-Higgs unification is naturally combined with [[GUT|grand unification]] of gauge groups, whence one then also speaks of _gauge-Higgs grand unification_ (e.g. [Hosotani-Yamatsu 15](#HosotaniYamatsu15))

Also the [[Connes-Lott models]] realize gauge-Higgs unification, in a [[non-commutative geometry|non-commutative geometric]] [[KK-compactification]].


### In string theory

In [[string theory]] (see _[[string phenomenology]]_) a Higgs mechanism can arise in a variety of ways. 

#### In intersecting D-brane models

Notably in [[intersecting D-brane models]] it arises naturally from brane recombination at intersections: ([Cremades-Ibanez-Marchesano 02, section 7](#CremadesIbanezMarchesano02)):

\begin{imagefromfile}
  "file_name": "BraneRecombination.png",
  "width": 600
\end{imagefromfile}

Further developments in [Ibanez-Marchesano-Rabadan 01](#IbanezMarchesanoRabadan01), [Hebecker-Knochel-Weigand 13](#HebeckerKnochelWeigand13) and specifically via [[string field theory]] in [HINSS 18](#HINSS18).

For review see [Ibanez-Uranga 12, fig 10.2](intersecting+D-brane+model#IbanezUranga12):

#### In $G_2$-MSSM

Discussion of the Higgs mechanism in the [[G2-MSSM]]: [Kane 11](#Kane11), [Kane-Kumar-Lu-Zheng 11](#KaneKumarLuZheng11), for review see [Kane 17](#Kane17), [Kane 18](#Kane18)

### Other

* in the [[technicolor]] model the Higgs field is not a fundamental particle but a compound of [[fermions]]. This realizes the Higgs effect entirely in ordinary [[gauge theory]]; 

* in [[Connes-Lott-Chamseddine-Barrett models]] it has been [shown](standard+model+of+particle+physics#NCGeometry) that the Higgs may be modeled as a component of the gauge bosons assuming that the [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|KK-reduction]] is over a certain non-commutative space of classical dimension 0.

## History

The Higgs mechanism was proposed in 1963-1964 by a fair number of authors essentially simultaneously, see the [References](#References) below. The explicit prediction of the Higgs boson implied by this mechanism though seems to be solely due to ([Higgs 64](#Higgs64)).

The Higgs boson (or at least something very much like it) was finally detected in 2013 at the [[LHC]] [[experiment]].

So for the Higgs particle prediction and experimental detection lie apart by about 50 years. Compare maybe to the [[neutrino]], which was predicted in 1930 and detected in 1956, about 26 years later.

The original articles explaining what is now called the Higgs mechanism by [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] were

While all these articles essentially describe the Higgs mechanism, apparently only the one by Peter Higgs explicitly points out that this mechanism predicts the existence of a new, then unobserved, boson, the one therefore now called the _Higgs boson_.
