## Idea

The _Higgs field_ or _[[Higgs boson]]_ is a [[scalar field|scalar]] [[physical field]]/[[fundamental particle]]  in a [[gauge theory]] such as the [[standard model of particle physics]] supposedly responsible for the [[spontaneously broken symmetry]] of the [[electroweak field]] ([[electroweak symmetry breaking]]) and for giving elementary particles their [[mass|masses]] by the _[[Higgs mechanism]]_. 

## Models

There is no lack of proposals for realizing the Higgs field in various big schemes of mathematical structures modelling physics. 

For instance

* in the [[technicolor]] model the Higgs field is not a fundamental particle but a compound of fermions. This realizes the Higgs effect entirely in ordinary [[gauge theory]]; 

* in [[string theory]] (see _[[string phenomenology]]_) a Higgs can arise in all sorts of ways. Notably in "intersecting brane models" it arises from strings localized at intersecting points (for a typical kind of survey see for instance [around slide 33 here](http://www-tap.scphys.kyoto-u.ac.jp/sc2/Kobayashi.pdf#page=33)) 

* in [[noncommutative geometry]] it has been [shown](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/standard+model+of+particle+physics#NCGeometry) that the Higgs may be modeled as a component of the gauge bosons assuming that the [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|KK-reduction]] is over a certain non-commutative space of classical dimension 0.

## History

The Higgs mechanism was proposed in 1963-1964 by a fair number of authors essentially simultaneously, see the [References](#References) below. The explicit prediction of the Higgs boson implied by this mechanism though seems to be solely due to ([Higgs 64](#Higgs64)).

The Higgs boson (or at least something very much like it) was finally detected in 2013 at the [[LHC]] [[experiment]].

So for the Higgs particle prediction and experimental detection lie apart by about 50 years. Compare maybe to the [[neutrino]], which was predicted in 1930 and detected in 1956, about 26 years later.

While all these articles essentially describe the Higgs mechanism, appearently only the one by Peter Higgs explicitly points out that this mechanism predicts the existence of a new, then unobserved, boson, the one therefore now called the _Higgs boson_.

The general theory of [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] is reviewed in
