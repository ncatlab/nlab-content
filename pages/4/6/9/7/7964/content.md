## Idea

The _Higgs field_ or _[[Higgs boson]]_ is a [[scalar field|scalar]] [[physical field]]/[[fundamental particle]]  in a [[gauge theory]] such as the [[standard model of particle physics]] supposedly responsible for the [[spontaneously broken symmetry]] of the [[electroweak field]] ([[electroweak symmetry breaking]]) and for giving elementary particles their [[mass|masses]] by the _[[Higgs mechanism]]_. 

## Properties

### Mass and vacuum (in-)stability
 {#MassAndVacuumInstability}

The observed [[rest mass]] of the Higgs particle is about $125$ [[GeV]].

This is determined by a [[local minimum]] of the Higgs [[potential energy|potential]]:

Curiously, the Higgs [[potential energy|potential]] is such that the Higgs field at this mass is at least close to being in a [[false vacuum]] ([DVEEGI 12](#DVEEGI12)):

More detailed computation confirms this result, showing that the observed Higgs vacuum is indeed very close to the boundary between the [[vacuum stability|stable]] and the meta-stable region ([BKPV 15](#BKPV15)):

From [Kusenko 15](#Kusenko15):

> $[$The$]$ conclusion is that the best theoretical fit to measured parameters, including the Higgs and top-quark masses, points to a metastable Universe. However, their analysis also concludes that values of parameters are closer to a region of absolute stability than suggested by previous studies: it is possible for the Universe to be fully stable (and for the standard model to work all the way up to the Planck scale), if the true values of measured parameters are only 1.3 standard deviations away from the current best estimates.

However, it has been argued that an actual [[false vacuum]] of the Higgs is incompatible with [[cosmology]], as due to [[vacuum fluctuations]] during [[inflation]] the [[vacuum decay]] would not have been avoided ([EGR 07](#EGR07), [EEGHR 09](#EEGHR09), [HKSZ 14](#HKSZ14), [EGMRSST 15](#EGMRSST15), [EKSYZ 16](#EKSYZ16)). In ([BDGGSSS 13, section 7](#BDGGSSS13), [Kane 18 , "Clue 4"](#Kane18)) it was argued that this suggests a further principle which prevents the vacuum instability and that a natural such principle is [[supersymmetry]].

## Models

There is no lack of proposals for realizing the Higgs field in various big schemes of mathematical structures modelling physics. 

For instance

* in the [[technicolor]] model the Higgs field is not a fundamental particle but a compound of fermions. This realizes the Higgs effect entirely in ordinary [[gauge theory]]; 

* in [[string theory]] (see _[[string phenomenology]]_) a Higgs can arise in all sorts of ways. Notably in "intersecting brane models" it arises from strings localized at intersecting points (for a typical kind of survey see for instance [around slide 33 here](http://www-tap.scphys.kyoto-u.ac.jp/sc2/Kobayashi.pdf#page=33)) 

* in [[noncommutative geometry]] it has been [shown](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/standard+model+of+particle+physics#NCGeometry) that the Higgs may be modeled as a component of the gauge bosons assuming that the [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|KK-reduction]] is over a certain non-commutative space of classical dimension 0.

## History

The Higgs mechanism was proposed in 1963-1964 by a fair number of authors essentially simultaneously, see the [References](#References) below. The explicit prediction of the Higgs boson implied by this mechanism though seems to be solely due to ([Higgs 64](#Higgs64)).

The Higgs boson (or at least something very much like it) was finally detected in 2013 at the [[LHC]] [[experiment]].

So for the Higgs particle prediction and experimental detection lie apart by about 50 years. Compare maybe to the [[neutrino]], which was predicted in 1930 and detected in 1956, about 26 years later.

### General

The original articles explaining what is now called the Higgs mechanism by [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] were

* P. Anderson, _Plasmons, gauge invariance and mass_, Physical Review 130: 439. (1963)

* [[François Englert]], [[Robert Brout]],  _Broken Symmetry and the Mass of Gauge Vector Mesons_, Physical Review Letters 13 (9): 321&#8211;23. (1964)

*  Gerald Guralnik, C. R. Hagen, ; T. W. B. Kibble, _Global Conservation Laws and Massless Particles_ Physical Review  (1964)

* {#Higgs64} [[Peter Higgs]], _Broken Symmetries and the Masses of Gauge Bosons_, Physical Review Letters 13 (16): 508&#8211;509. (1964)
  

While all these articles essentially describe the Higgs mechanism, appearently only the one by Peter Higgs explicitly points out that this mechanism predicts the existence of a new, then unobserved, boson, the one therefore now called the _Higgs boson_.
