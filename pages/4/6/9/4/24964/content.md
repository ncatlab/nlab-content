## Idea

Pluralism is a philosophical position which states that there are multiple equally valid approaches to a particular field. This contrasts with [[reductionism]], which states that all of that field should be based on a common foundation. 

## Pluralism in the foundations of mathematics

In the context of the [[foundations of mathematics]], pluralism states that rather than singling out a single approach to the foundations of mathematics, such as [[ZFC]] or [[ETCS]], as the universal approach to the foundations of mathematics, each different approach are all regarded as valid approaches to the foundations of mathematics. 

Approaches to the foundations of mathematics could be distinguished by its characterization of [[equality]] (whether as a proposition, a judgment, or as a type), [[equivalence]] (whether it is more fundamental than equality for collections), and [[propositions]]/[[logic]] (whether it is primitive or derived), which distinguishes [[material set theory]], [[structural set theory]], [[categorical set theory]], [[allegorical set theory]], [[higher order logic]], [[dependent type theory]], [[FOLDS]], [[class theory]], [[formal category theory]], [[preset theory]], and so forth, from each other. 

There is another dimension in which approaches to the foundations of mathematics are distinguished, which is the strength of the theory; these concerns are orthogonal to the above concern regarding the characterization of equality, equivalence and propositions/logic: these distinguish [[predicative mathematics]], [[strongly predicative mathematics]], [[weakly predicative mathematics]], [[constructive mathematics]], [[classical mathematics]], [[set-level foundations]], [[higher foundations]], and so forth, from each other. 

To show that these two dimensions are independent of each other, we give some examples. On one hand, one could have a [[material set theory]] in which all [[sets]] have a [[choice operator]]; on the other hand, one could merely have a material set theory which is strongly predicative. In addition, we could have a [[categorical set theory]] in which all sets have a [[choice operator]], and a categorical set theory which is strongly predicative. Formal category theory is usually considered to be [[higher foundations]], but set-level formal category theory could be considered by adding an [[axiom]] or rule that every category is a [[discrete category]]. 

There is also mathematics based in [[linear logic]]/[[linear dependent type theory]], as well as [[paraconsistent mathematics]], which from the pluralistic view are also true in their own ways. 

## Pluralism in physics

There are also the philosophical position of pluralism in [[physics]], which arose in response to the position of [[reductionism]], which states that all of physics could be described by one basic universal theory. 

In practice, pluralism is true, because even if one were to say the [[standard model of particle physics]] were to validate the reductionist paradigm, the Standard Model is so complex that particle physicists have not been able to model the dynamics of a single proton from the Standard Model, let alone the dynamics of molecules, chemical reactions, condensed matter systems, and galaxies. And furthermore, the complexity means that it is likely that even if humans could characterize such phenomena entirely based upon the Standard Model, it might be too long and complex for a single human to understand during their lifetime. This means that in practice, physicists usually have different theories for each different general phenomena; the [[quantum field theories]] used in [[condensed matter physics]] are [[effective field theories]] different from the Standard Model, and the models used in molecular chemistry and galactic physics aren't quantum field theories at all.
