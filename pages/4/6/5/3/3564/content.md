## Definition

A __Heyting prealgebra__ is simply a [[preorder]] whose [[poset]]al reflection is a [[Heyting algebra]]; i.e., it is a preorder which is a [[bicartesian closed category]].

In most contexts, there is little need to maintain a difference between Heyting algebras whose carriers are preorders vs. those whose carriers are strictly posets; indeed, in most contexts, there is no need to consider such a distinction to even be meaningful, the only relevant notion of equality being that derived from the preorder structure.  See [[principle of equivalence]].

However, in contexts where there _is_ a separately provided relevant notion of equality on the carrier which is potentially finer-grained than that provided by the preorder structure alone (i.e., in situations where a Heyting algebra carries further structure $x = y$ not necessarily provided simply by $x \leq y \wedge y \leq x$), then it may be worthwhile to track such differences.

## Examples

* The [[propositions]] in a [[formal logic|logic]] naturally form a Heyting prealgebra under [[entailment]].

  One can take the quotient under bi-entailment to get a poset and a Heyting algebra, or (as discussed above) one can say that bi-entailment is the only relevant notion of equality so that the preorder is really already a poset. But if one wants to simultaneously talk about the syntactic equality of terms, then there will be unequal terms that entail each other, and so one has only a Heyting prealgebra.
