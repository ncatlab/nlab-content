## Idea

The [[equivariant cohomology|equivariant]] version of [[elliptic cohomology]], the higher [[chromatic homotopy theory|chromatic]] analogue of [[equivariant K-theory]].

## Related concepts

the proposal of [Ginzburg-Kapranov-Vasserot 95](#GinzburgKapranovVasserot95) was formalized in terms of [[geometric morphisms]] of [[(infinity,1)-toposes]].

### Relation to loop group representations

That equivariant elliptic cohomology is related to [[representations]] of [[loop groups]] as [[equivariant K-theory]] is related to the [[representation theory]] of the underlying groups had long been conjectured. The idea appears in

cohomology_, volume 342 of London Math. Soc. Lecture Note
Ser., pages 114&#8211;121. Cambridge Univ. Press, Cambridge, 2007

elliptic cohomology_ . Geom. Topol., 7:91&#8211;153,

and was then further refined in section 5.2 of ([Lurie](#Lurie)) and in ([Gepner 05](#Gepner05)).

Relation to the [[Witten genus]] [[partition function]] of [[superstrings]] is discussed in
