## Definition

An [[integral domain]] $R$ is a **principal ideal domain** if it satisfies any of these equivalent conditions:

1. Every [[ideal]] in $R$ is a [[principal ideal]]. 

1. $R$ is a [[Bézout domain|Bézout]] [[unique factorization domain]]

1. $R$ is a [[Bézout domain|Bézout]] [[atomic domains]]

1. $R$ is a [[Noetherian ring|Noetherian]] [[Bézout domain]] 

1. $R$ is a [[Bézout domain]] which satisfies the [[ascending chain condition on principal ideals]]  

1. $R$ has a [[Dedekind-Hasse norm]]

Often _pid_ is used as an abbreviation of "principal ideal domain".

To show that definitions (2-5) are equivalent, consider that unique factorization domains, atomic domains, and Noetherian domains all satisfy the [[ascending chain condition on principal ideals]]. In addition, every [[GCD domain]] which satisfies the [[ascending chain condition on principal ideals]] is a [[unique factorization domain]]. Since [[Bézout domains]] are [[GCD domains]], the first four definitions are equivalent to each other. 

Now to show that definitions 1 is equivalent to (2-5). Every integral domain whose ideals are principal is a Bézout domain by considering the ideals which are finitely generated. To show that these are Noetherian domains and unique factorization domains, we have the following:

\begin{lemma}
In a integral domain $R$ whose ideals are principal, an element $x$ is irreducible iff $(x)$ is a [[maximal ideal]]. 
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Suppose $x$ is irreducible and $a \notin (x)$. Then the ideal generated by $a, x$ is principal, say $(b)$. Then $x = b y$ and since $x$ is irreducible, one of $b, y$ is a unit; if $y$ is a unit then $(x) = (b) = (a, x)$ and thus $a \in (x)$, contradiction. So then $b$ must be a unit, i.e., $(b)$ is the improper ideal. Thus $(x)$ has no proper extension: $(x)$ is maximal. 

For any ring $R$, if $(x)$ is maximal and $x = a b$ for a non-unit $a$, then the inclusion $(x) \subseteq (a)$ is an equality by maximality, so $a = x v$ for some $v$. Then $x = x v b$. In an integral domain we conclude $1 = v b$; thus $b$ is a unit. 
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
An integral domain $R$ whose ideals are principal is [[Noetherian ring|Noetherian]]. 
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The union of an ascending chain of ideals $I_1 \subseteq I_2 \subseteq \ldots$ is an ideal $I$; if $I = (x)$, then $x$ belongs to one of the $I_n$, whereupon $I = I_n$. 
\end{proof}

Thus, an integral domain $R$ whose ideals are principal is a Noetherian Bézout domain. 

Similarly,

\begin{theorem}
An integral domain $R$ whose ideals are principal is a [[unique factorization domain]]. 
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Working in classical logic, Proposition \ref{noeth} says that the reverse inclusion relation on the set of nonzero ideals is [[well-founded relation|well-founded]]. Let $A$ be the subset of ideals $(a)$ that are products of finitely many (maybe zero!) maximal principal ideals. For any proper ideal $(x) \neq (0)$, if every $(t)$ properly containing $(x)$ can be factored into maximals, then so can $(x)$. (Spelling this out: either $(x)$ is maximal/irreducible, or factors as $(s)(t)$ where both $s$ and $t$ are non-units; $(s)$ and $(t)$ factor into maximals by hypothesis, and therefore so does $(x)$.) Thus $A$ is an inductive set, so by well-foundedness it contains every ideal $(x) \neq (0)$, i.e., $x$ can be factored into irreducibles. 

For uniqueness of the factorization, we first remark that if $p$ is irreducible and $p|a b$, then $p|a$ or $p|b$. (For $R/(p)$ is a [[field]] and thus *a fortiori* an [[integral domain]], so that if $a b \equiv 0 \; mod p$, then $a \equiv 0 \; mod p$ or $b \equiv 0 \; mod p$.) Thus if $p_1 p_2 \ldots p_m = q_1 q_2 \ldots q_n$ are two factorizations into irreducibles of the same element, then $p_1$ divides one of the irreducibles $q_i$, in which case $(p_1) = (q_i)$ and each is a unit times the other, meaning we can cancel $p_1$ on both sides and argue by induction. 
\end{proof}

Thus, an integral domain $R$ whose ideals are principal is a Bézout unique factorization domain. 

It remains to show using classical logic that every ideal of a Noetherian Bézout domain or a Bézout UFD is a principal ideal... (to be done)

## Examples

* any [[field]]

* the ring $\mathbb{Z}$ of [[integers]]

* a [[polynomial ring]] with [[coefficients]] in a field (in fact, for any commutative ring $R$, the ring $R[x]$ is a pid if and _only if_ $R$ is a field) 

* a [[valuation ring|discrete valuation ring]] (for example, a ring of formal power series over a field) 

* any [[Euclidean domain]]

* in the ring of [[entire function|entire]] [[holomorphic functions]] on $\mathbb{C}$ every finitely generated ideal is principal  ([Helmer 40](#Helmer40)), but the ring is only a [[Bézout domain]].

That both the [[integers]] and the [[polynomial rings]] $\mathbb{F}_q[x]$ over [[finite fields]] are principal integral domains with [[finite group|finite]] [[group of units]] is one aspect of the close similarity between the two that is the topic of the [[function field analogy]]. That also the [[holomorphic functions]] on the [[complex plane]] form a [[Bézout domain]] may then be viewed as part of the further similarity that relates the previous two to topics such as [[geometric Langlands duality]]. See at _[[function field analogy -- table]]_ for more on this.

## Structure theory of modules 
 {#StructureTheoryOfModules}

### Free and projective modules 

+-- {: .num_theorem #free} 
###### Theorem 
If $R$ is a pid, then any [[submodule]] $M$ of a [[free module]] $F$ over $R$ is also free. (For the converse statement, see [here](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/free+module#submod).) 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
By freeness of $F$, there exists an isomorphism $F \cong \sum_{j \in J} R_j$, a [[coproduct]] of copies $R_j$ of $R$ (as a module over the ring $R$) indexed over a set $J$, which we assume [[well-ordering|well-ordered]] using the [[axiom of choice]]. Define submodules of $F$: 

$$F_{\leq j} \coloneqq \sum_{i \leq j} R_i, \qquad F_{\lt j} \coloneqq \sum_{i \lt j} R_i\,.$$ 

Any element of $M \cap F_{\leq j}$ can be written uniquely as $(x, r)$ where $x \in F_{\lt j}$ and $r \in R_j$. Define a [[homomorphism]]

$$p_j \colon M \cap F_{\leq j} \to R$$ 

by $p_j((x, r)) = r$. The [[kernel]] of $p_j$ is $M \cap F_{\lt j}$, and we have an [[exact sequence]]

$$0 \to M \cap F_{\lt j} \to M \cap F_{\leq j} \to \im p_j \to 0$$ 

where $\im p_j$ is a submodule (i.e., an [[ideal]]) of $R$, hence generated by a single element $r_j$. Let $K \subseteq J$ consist of those $j$ such that $r_j \neq 0$, and for $k \in K$, choose $m_k$ such that $p_k(m_k) = r_k$. We claim that $\{m_k: k \in K\}$ forms a [[basis]] for $M$. 

First we prove [[linear independence]] of $\{m_k\}$. Suppose $\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i m_{k_i} = 0$, with $k_1 \lt k_2 \lt \ldots \lt k_n$. Applying $p_{k_n}$, we get $a_n p_{k_n}(m_{k_n}) = a_n r_{k_n} = 0$. Since $r_{k_n} \neq 0$, we have $a_n = 0$ (since we are working over a domain). The assertion now follows by [[induction]].  

Now we prove that the $m_k$ generate $M$. Assume otherwise, and let $j \in J$ be the least $j$ such that some $m \in M \cap F_{\leq j}$ cannot be written as a linear combination of the $m_k$, for $k \in K$. If $j \notin K$, then $m \in M \cap F_{\lt j}$, so that $m \in M \cap F_{\leq i}$ for some $i \lt j$, but this contradicts minimality of $j$. Therefore $j \in K$. Now, we have $p_j(m) = r \cdot r_j$ for some $r$; put $m' = m - r m_j$. Clearly 

$$p_j(m') = p_j(m) - r \cdot p_j(m_j) = 0$$ 

and so $m' \in M \cap F_{\lt j}$. Thus $m' \in M \cap F_{\leq i}$ for some $i \lt j$. At the same time, $m'$ cannot be written as a linear combination of the $m_k$; again, this contradicts minimality of $j$. Thus the $m_k$ generate $M$, as claimed.

###### Proposition
**([[matrices]] over [[principal ideal domains]] [[matrix equivalence|equivalent]] to [[Smith normal form]])**

For $R$ a [[commutative ring]] which is a [[principal ideal domain]], every [[matrix]] $A \in Mat_{n \times m}(R)$ with entries in $R$ is [[matrix equivalence|matrix equivalent]] to a [[diagonal matrix]] filled up with zeros:

There exist [[invertible matrices]] $P \in Mat_{n \times n}(R)$ and $Q \in Mat_{m \times m}(R)$ such that the [[matrix product|product matrix]] $P A Q$ is a [[diagonal matrix]] filled up with zeros:

### Torsion-free modules 

+-- {: .num_prop #torsionfree}
###### Proposition 
A finitely generated [[torsion subgroup|torsionfree]] module $M$ over a pid $R$ is free. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
Let $S$ be a finite set of generators of $M$, and let $T \subseteq S$ be a maximal subset of linearly independent elements. (Unless $M = 0$, then $T$ has at least one element, because $M$ is torsionfree.) We claim that $M$ can be embedded as a submodule of the free module $F$ generated by $T$ (which in turn is the span of $T$ as a submodule $F \subseteq M$). By Theorem \ref{free}, it follows that $M$ is free. 

Let $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ be the elements of $T$. It follows from maximality of $T$ that for any $m \in S - T$, there is a linear relation 

$$r_m m + r_1 x_1 + \ldots + r_n x_n = 0$$ 

with $r_m \neq 0$. For each $m$ in the complement $S - T$, pick such an $r_m$, and form $r = \prod_{m \in S - T} r_m$. Then the image of the scalar multiplication $\lambda_r \colon M \to M$ factors through $F \subseteq M$, and $M \to \lambda_r(M)$ is monic because $M$ is torsionfree. This completes the proof. 
=-- 

+-- {: .num_prop #flat} 
###### Proposition 
Let $R$ be a pid. Then an $R$-module $M$ is torsionfree if and only if it is [[flat module|flat]]. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
Suppose $M$ is flat. Let $K$ be the field of fractions of $R$; since $R$ is a domain, we have a monic $R$-module map $R \to K$. By flatness, we have an induced monomorphism $M \cong R \otimes_R M \to K \otimes_R M$. For any nonzero $r \in R$, the naturality square 

$$\array{
M & \to & K \otimes_R M \\
 \mathllap{\lambda_r} \downarrow & & \downarrow \mathrlap{1 \otimes \lambda_r} \\ 
M & \to & K \otimes_R M
}$$ 

commutes, and since the map $1 \otimes \lambda_r$ is multiplication by a non-zero scalar on a vector space, it follows that this map and therefore also $\lambda_r$ is monic, i.e., $M$ is torsionfree. 

In the other direction, suppose $M$ is torsionfree. Any module is the filtered colimit over the system of finitely generated submodules and inclusions between them; in this case all the finitely generated submodules of $M$ are torsion-free and hence free, by Proposition \ref{torsionfree}. Thus $M$ is a filtered colimit of free modules; it is therefore flat by a standard result proved [here](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/flat+module#filtfree).

### Structure theory of finitely generated modules 

_[[structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain]]_


## In constructive mathematics
{#InConstructiveMathematics}

First of all, in [[constructive mathematics]], there are various notions of [[integral domains]], such as [[Heyting integral domains]] and [[discrete integral domains]]. These already result in multiple notions of principal ideal domains, such as *Heyting principal ideal domains* and *discrete principal ideal domains*. 

In addition, the various definitions of principal ideal domains do not coincide with each other in constructive mathematics. For example, consider the classically true equivalence of discrete Bézout unique factorization domains and discrete integral domains where every ideal is principal:

\begin{theorem}
Given a [[discrete integral domain|discrete]] [[Bézout domain|Bézout]] [[unique factorization domain]] $R$, every ideal of $R$ is a [[principal ideal]] if and only if the [[excluded middle|law of excluded middle]] holds. 
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
In one direction, the usual proofs rely on being able to [[decidable proposition|decide]] whether any particular element of $R$ belongs to the ideal or not. For the converse, let $\varphi$ be an arbitrary proposition. Consider the ideal $\{ x \in R | (x = 0) \vee \varphi \}$. By assumption, it is generated by the elements of $R$. Since $R$ is a [[discrete integral domain]], it holds that $x = 0$ or $x \neq 0$. In the first case $\neg\varphi$ holds, in the second $\varphi$.
\end{proof}

It is unknown whether in the absence of excluded middle, there are Heyting integral domains where every ideal is a principal ideal. But with Heyting integral domains, maybe we should be talking about *[[principal anti-ideal]] domains* instead of principal ideal domains.
