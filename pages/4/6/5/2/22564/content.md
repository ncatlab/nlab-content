## Definitions

Given a [[natural number]] $n$, an __n-ary operation__ on a [[set]] $S$ is a [[function]] 

$$\phi:(\mathrm{Fin}(n) \to S) \to S$$ 

from the function set $\mathrm{Fin}(n) \to S$ to $S$ itself, where $\mathrm{Fin}(n)$ is the finite set with $n$ elements. The __arity__ of the operation is $n$. In general, if the natural number $n$ is not specified, these are called **finitary operations**. 

Sets with finitary operations are called **finitary magmas** or **finitary groupoids**. 

More generally, a finitary operation in a [[multicategory]] is just a [[multimorphism]]. 

### Arbitrary arity

More generally, one could use an arbitrary [[set]] instead of a [[finite set]]. However, the generalizations are only definable in [[closed monoidal category|closed]] [[multicategories]], rather than any [[multicategory]]. 

## Properties

Every set $S$ with an $n$-ary operation $\phi$ comes with an [[endomorphism]] called the *$n$-th [[power operation]]*

$$
  \array{
    S
    & 
    \overset{\;\;(-)^n\;\;}{\longrightarrow} 
    &
    S
    \\
    x
    &\mapsto&
    \phi \circ diag_n(x)
    \,,
  }
$$ 

where $ S \overset{diag_n}{\longrightarrow} S^n$ is the [[diagonal morphism]].
