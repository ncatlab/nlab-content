## Idea

In [[perturbative quantum field theory]] a _radiative correction_ is a contribution to the [[Feynman perturbation series]] corresponding to [[Feynman diagrams]] that describe exchange of [[virtual particle|virtual]] quanta of radiation, such as [[photons]] (for [[electromagnetic radiation]]).

## Example

* The main contribution to the _[[Lamb shift]]_ (often referred to as _the_ vertex correction) is due to the radiative correction induced by the [[electron]] emitting a [[virtual particle|virtual]] [[photon]], then interacting with the [[background field|background]] [[electromagnetic field]], and and re-absorbing the [[virtual particle|virtual]] [[photon]]; described by this [[Feynman diagram]]:
