#Idea#

A concordance between cocycles in [[cohomology]] is a relation similar to but different from a coboundary.

A concordance is a left [[homotopy]] in an [[(∞,1)-topos]] with respect to a _topological_ interval object, i.e. not with respect to the _categorical_ interval object.

For instance for $S = Diff$ the [[site]] of smooth manifolds, there is

* the "topological interval" $I \in \mathbf{H}_{diff}$ which is the [[smooth ∞-stack]] on $Diff$ [[representable functor|represented by]] the manifold $I = [0,1]$;

* the "categorical interval" $Ex^\infty \Delta^1 \in \mathbf{H}_{Diff}$ is the [[smooth ∞-stack]] that is constant on the free groupoid on a single morphism.


#Definition#

For $\mathbf{H}$ and [[(∞,1)-topos]] with a fixed notion of topological [[interval object]] $I$, for $A \in \mathbf{A}$ any coefficient object and $X \in \mathbf{H}$ any other object, a **concordance** between two objects

$$
  c,d \in \mathbf{H}(X,A)
$$

(two cocycles in $A$-[[cohomology]] on $X$)

is an object $\eta \in A(X \times I)$ such that

$$
\begin{matrix}
X&&\\
\downarrow&\searrow^{c}&\\
X \times I&\stackrel{\eta}{\to}& A\\
\uparrow& \nearrow_{d}&\\
X&&
\end{matrix}
\,.
$$

# Examples #

* For $A = VectrBund(-)$ the difference between concordance of [[vectorial bundles]] and isomorphism of vectorial bundles plays a crucial rule in the construction of [[K-theory]] from this model.
