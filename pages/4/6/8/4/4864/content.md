## Quotes

On the open problem of formulating [[M-theory]]:

\linebreak

[Duff 96, totality of Section 6](#Duff96):

> The overriding problem in superunification in the coming years will be to take the Mystery out of M-theory, while keeping the Magic and the Membranes.

\linebreak

[Duff 98a, last paragraph (p. 6)](#Duff98):

> Despite all these successes, physicists are glimpsing only small corners of M-theory; the big picture is still lacking.

> $[...]$

> Indeed future historians may judge the late 20th century as a time when theorists were like  children  playing  on  the  seashore, diverting themselves with the smoother pebbles or prettier shells of superstrings while the great ocean of M-theory lay undiscovered before them.

\linebreak

[Duff 98b, p. 6](#Duff98b):

> we are only just beginning to scratch the surface of the ultimate meaning of M-theory, and for the time being therefore, M stands for Magic and Mystery too.

\linebreak

[Duff 99, p.330](#Duff99):

> future historians may judge the period 1984-95 as a time when theorists were like boys playing by the sea shore, and diverting themselves with the smoother pebbles or prettier shells of perturbative ten-dimensiorial superstrings while the great ocean of non-perturbative eleven-dimensional M-theory lay all undiscovered before them.

Interview with [[Mike Duff]] by Graham Fermelo, _The universe speaks in numbers -- Interview 14_ ([web](https://grahamfarmelo.com/the-universe-speaks-in-numbers-interview-14/)):

> {#WeDontKnowWhatItIs} (17:04) The problem we face is that we have a patchwork understanding of M-theory, like a quilt. We understand this corner and that corner, but what's lacking is the overarching big picture. So directly or indirectly, my research hopes to explain what M-theory really is. We don't know what it is. 

> In a certain sense, and this is not a popular statement, I think it's premature to be asking: "What are the empirical consequences", because it's not yet in a mature enough state, where we can sensibly make falsifiable prediction.

\linebreak


{#Duff20} [[Duff interview at M-Theory-Mathematics 2020]]:

> (06:59) But the matrix model itself was not all of M-theory; it was a corner of M-theory, and it told us certain interesting things, but there were interesting things about M-theory that it didn't tell us. 

> (07:13) I think we are still looking, in fact, for what M-theory really is.  

> (07:19) We have a patchwork picture. We understand various corners. But the overarching big picture of M-theory is still waiting to be discovered, in my view. 

> (08:12) M-theory in 1995 was very promising, and it's taught us a lot about the fundamental interactions; but the final theory is still not with us. 

> (12:46) I wouldn't like to predict what the ultimate picture of M-theory will be; I imagine it will be something quite different from what we can imagine now. 

> (16:36) That's why I think M-theory is not yet in a mature enough stage for us to make falsifiable predictions.

> (16:44) We don't understand the theory sufficiently well yet to do so.
