## Quotes

On the open problem of formulating [[M-theory]]:

[Duff 96, totality of Section 6](#Duff96):

> The overriding problem in superunification in the coming years will be to take the Mystery out of M-theory, while keeping the Magic and the Membranes.

[Duff 98a, last paragraph (p. 6)](#Duff98):

> Despite all these successes, physicists are glimpsing only small corners of M-theory; the big picture is still lacking.

> $[...]$

> Indeed future historians may judge the late 20th century as a time when theorists were like  children  playing  on  the  seashore, diverting themselves with the smoother pebbles or prettier shells of superstrings while the great ocean of M-theory lay undiscovered before them.

[Duff 98b, p. 6](#Duff98b):

> we are only just beginning to scratch the surface of the ultimate meaning of M-theory, and for the time being therefore, M stands for Magic and Mystery too.

[Duff 99, p.330](#Duff99):

> future historians may judge the period 1984-95 as a time when theorists were like boys playing by the sea shore, and diverting themselves with the smoother pebbles or prettier shells of perturbative ten-dimensiorial superstrings while the great ocean of non-perturbative eleven-dimensional M-theory lay all undiscovered before them.
