## Idea and definition

Pyknotic sets aim to provide a convenient setting
in the framework of [[homotopical algebra]] for working with algebraic objects that have some sort of [[topological space|topology]] on them.

\begin{definition}
A _pyknotic set_ is a [[sheaf]] of sets on the site of [[compact]] [[Hausdorff]]
[[topological spaces]] whose underlying set has [[rank]] smaller
than the smallest [[strongly inaccessible cardinal]].
The [[Grothendieck topology]] on the latter category
is generated by finite jointly effective epimorphic families of maps.
\end{definition}

Pyknotic sets form a [[coherent topos]].
