## Idea and definition

Pyknotic sets (from the ancient Greek πυκνός, meaning thick, dense, or compact) aim to provide a convenient setting
in the framework of [[homotopical algebra]] for working with algebraic objects that have some sort of [[topological space|topology]] on them.

\begin{definition}
A _pyknotic set_ is a [[sheaf]] of sets on the site of [[compact]] [[Hausdorff]]
[[topological spaces]] whose underlying set has [[rank]] smaller
than the smallest [[strongly inaccessible cardinal]].
The [[Grothendieck topology]] on the latter category
is generated by finite jointly effective epimorphic families of maps.
\end{definition}

Pyknotic sets form a [[coherent topos]], whereas the closely related category of [[condensed sets]] does not form a topos ([BarHai 19, Sec. 0.3](#BarHai19)).

This construction generalizes to pyknotic objects for any [[(∞,1)-category]].

Compactly generated topological spaces embed fully faithfully into pyknotic sets, in a manner that preserves limits. 

> One key point, however, is that the relationship between compactly generated topological spaces and pyknotic sets is _dual_ to the relationship between compactly generated topological spaces and general topological spaces: in topological spaces, compactly generated topological spaces are stable under colimits but not limits; in pyknotic sets, compactly generated topological spaces are stable under limits but not colimits ([BarHai 19, 0.2.3](#BarHai19)).

The concept of pyknotic structure can be compared to that of [[motivation for cohesive toposes|cohesive structure]]:

> one of the main peculiarities of the theory of pyknotic structures ... is also one of its advantages: the forgetful functor is not faithful. ([BarHai 19, 0.2.4](#BarHai19))

The global sections functor is given by evaluation at the one-point compactum. This has a left adjoint sending a set, $X$, to the discrete pyknotic set attached to $X$, and a right adjoint to the *indiscrete* pyknotic set attached to $X$. The left adjoint, the discrete functor, does not preserve limits and so does not possess a further left adjoint. The topos of pyknotic sets is thus not [[cohesive]] ([BarHai 19, 2.2.14](#BarHai19)).

 
## Examples

For example [[locally compact topological space|locally compact]] [[abelian groups]], [[normed rings]], and [[complete metric space|complete]] [[locally convex topological vector spaces]] are pyknotic objects.

## Alternative definitions

Pyknotic sets can be described as sheaves on several different sites. 

1. Take $\mathcal{C}$ to be the Kleisli category for the ultrafilter monad: objects are sets and morphisms are functions between the sets of ultrafilters borne by those sets. Pynotic sets are functors $\mathcal{C}^{op}\to Set$ that carry coproducts in $\mathcal{C}$ to products in $Set$. So they can be understood as models for a large [[Lawvere theory]].

1. Take $\mathcal{C}$  to be the category of compact Hausdorff spaces (i.e., compacta) but where the sheaf condition is somewhat more elaborate, requiring in addition that $F$ carries the coequalizer displaying an epimorphism $K \to L$ as the cokernel of its kernel pair to monomorphism.

1. Take $\mathcal{C} \subset Top$ to be the subcategory of tiny compact hausdorff spaces that are extremally disconnected, called **Stonean** spaces. A pyknotic set carries finite coproducts to products in $Set$.
