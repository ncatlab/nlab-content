## Idea and definition

Pyknotic sets aim to provide a convenient setting
in the framework of [[homotopical algebra]] for working with algebraic objects that have some sort of [[topological space|topology]] on them.

\begin{definition}
A _pyknotic set_ is a [[sheaf]] of sets on the site of [[compact]] [[Hausdorff]]
[[topological spaces]] whose underlying set has [[rank]] smaller
than the smallest [[strongly inaccessible cardinal]].
The [[Grothendieck topology]] on the latter category
is generated by finite jointly effective epimorphic families of maps.
\end{definition}

Pyknotic sets form a [[coherent topos]], whereas the closely related category of [[condensed sets]] does not form a topos ([BarHai 19, Sec. 0.3](#BarHai19)).

The global sections functor is given by evaluation at the one-point compactum. This has a left adjoint sending a set, $X$, to the discrete pyknotic set attached to $X$, and a right adjoint to the *indiscrete* pyknotic set attached to $X$. The left adjoint, the discrete functor, does not preserve limits and so does not possess a further left adjoint. The topos of pyknotic sets is thus not [[cohesive]] ([BarHai 19, 2.2.14](#BarHai19)).

Compactly generated topological spaces embed fully faithfully into pyknotic sets, in a manner that preserves limits. 

> One key point, however, is that the relationship between compactly generated topological spaces and pyknotic sets is _dual_ to the relationship between compactly generated topological spaces and general topological spaces: in topological spaces, compactly generated topological spaces are stable under colimits but not limits; in pyknotic sets,compactly generated topological spaces are stable under limits but not colimits ([BarHai 19, 0.2.3](#BarHai19)).

This construction generalizes to pyknotic objects for any [[(∞,1)-category]]. 

## Examples

For example [[locally compact topological space|locally compact]] [[abelian groups]], [[normed rings]], and [[complete metric space|complete]] [[locally convex topological vector spaces]] are pyknotic objects.
