I am a graduate student at the University of Chicago. This is my first time contributing to a public blog, so I'd very much appreciate comments on style or formatting.

My webpage can be found [here](http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~eriehl/).

Welcome, Emily!

This is not really a blog, but a wiki, the main consequence of which is that everything that you write is subject to editing by others, and you are encouraged to edit what the rest of us write.
