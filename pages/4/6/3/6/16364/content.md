## In continuum mechanics / solid state physics

In [[elasticity theory]] (in the context of [[continuum mechanics]]/[[solid state physics]]) a _stress tensor_ expresses [[forces]] acting inside a [[solid body]].

There is a corresponding [[strain tensor]] which expresses the deformation of the body in reaction to these forces.
