## Idea



The _&#233;tale (∞,1)-site_ is an [[(∞,1)-site]] whose [[(∞,1)-topos]] encodes the [[derived geometry]] version of the geometry encoded by the [[topos]] over the [[étale site]].


Its underlying [[(∞,1)-category]] is the [[opposite (∞,1)-category]] $sCAlg_k^{op}$ of commutative [[simplicial algebras]] over a commutative ring $k$, whose [[covering]] families are essentially those which under [[decategorification]] become coverings in the [[étale site]] of ordinary $k$-algebras.

## Definition  

Let $k$ be a commutative ring. Let $T$ be the [[Lawvere theory]] of commutative [[associative algebra]]s over $k$. 

+-- {: .un_def}
###### Definition

Let 

$$
  \infty CAlg_k := T Alg_\infty
$$

be the [[(∞,1)-category]] of [[∞-algebra over an (∞,1)-algebraic theory|∞-algebras]] over $T$ regarded as an [[(∞,1)-algebraic theory]].

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

Let $sCAlg_k = (T Alg)^{\Delta^{op}}$ be the [[sSet]]-[[enriched category]] of [[simplicial algebra|simplicial commutative associative k-algebras]] equipped with the standard [[model structure on simplicial T-algebras]]. Write $sCAlg_k^\circ$ for the $(\infty,1)$-category [[presentable (∞,1)-category]]. Then we have an [[equivalence of (∞,1)-categories]]

$$
  \infty CAlg_k \simeq (sCAlg_k)^\circ
  \,.
$$ 

=--

This is a special case of the general statement discussed at [[(∞,1)-algebraic theory]]. See also ([Lurie, remark 4.1.2](#Lurie)).

###### Notation


For $X \in \infty CAlg_k^{op}$ we write $\mathcal{O}(X)$ for the corresponding object in $\infty CAlg_k$ and conversely for $A \in \infty CAlg_k$ we write $Spec A$ for the corresponding object in $\infty CAlg_k^{op}$.

So $Spec \mathcal{O} X = X$ and $\mathcal{O} Spec A = A$, by definition of notation.

Notice from  the discussion at [[model structure on simplicial algebras]] the [[homotopy group]] functor

$$
  \pi_* : sCAlg_k \to CAlg_k
  \,.
$$


+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

A morphism $Spec A  \to Spec B$ in $\infty CAlg_k^{op}$ is an **&#233;tale morphism** if

1. The underlying morphism $Spec \pi_0(A) \to Spec \pi_0(B)$ is an [[étale morphism]] of [[scheme]]s;

1. for each $i \in \mathbb{N}$ the canonical morphism

   $$
     \pi_i(A) \otimes_{\pi_0(A)} \pi_0(B) \to \pi_i(B)
   $$

   is an [[isomorphism]].

###### Definition

The **&#233;tale $(\infty,1)$-site** is the [[(∞,1)-site]] whose underlying $(\infty,1)$-category is the [[opposite (∞,1)-category]] $\infty CAlg_k^{op}$ and whose [[covering]] famlies $\{Spec A_i \to Spec B\}_{i \in I}$ are those collections of morphisms such that

1. every $Spec A_i \to Spec B$ is an &#233;tale morphism

2. there is a [[finite set|finite subset]] $J \subset I$  such that the underlying decategorified family $\{Spec \pi_0(A_j) \to Spec \pi_0(B)\}_{j \in J}$ is a covering family in the 1-[[étale site]].

This appears as ([To&#235;nVezzosi, def. 2.2.2.12](#ToenVezzosi)) and as ([Lurie, def. 4.3.3; def. 4.3.13](#Lurie)).

## Properties

+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Theorem

With the [[étale site|étale 1-site]] regarded as a [[geometry (for structured (infinity,1)-toposes)|pregeometry]], the &#233;tale $(\infty,1)$-site is the [[geometry (for structured (∞,1)-toposes)]] generated by it.

This is ([Lurie, prop. 4.3.15](#Lurie)).
