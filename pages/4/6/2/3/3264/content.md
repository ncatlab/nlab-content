**Alexander (or Sasha) Be&#301;linson** is currently a professor at University of Chicago. He was student of [[Yuri Manin]] at Moscow State University, with main works in algebraic geometry. He has made visionary contributions to the study of algebraic cycles,  automorphic forms and L-functions, [[algebraic K-theory]], Hodge theory, [[motive]]s and [[motivic cohomology]]. He conjectured the category of motivic sheaves with remarkable cohomological properties, what is often called the Be&#301;linson dream. Some of his works, especially those in collaboration with [[Vladimir Drinfeld|Vladimir Drinfel'd]] are of large importance to mathematical physics, especially on their concept of **chiral algebras** which are an approach to a chiral part of the [[conformal field theory]] on a curve, which is a geometric counterpart of the theory of [[vertex operator algebra]]s. In late 1980s Be&#301;linson proposed a geometric analogue of the Langlands program, now called [[geometric Langlands]] program, which has been continued in his collaboration with Drinfel'd and also by Ed Frenkel, Dennis Gaitsgory, [[Ivan Mirković]], Kari Vilonen, and more recently taken up by mathematical physics community lead by [[Edward Witten|Witten]].  

Be&#301;linson has substantial contributions to [[geometric representation theory]], which has been revolutionized after two discoveries: his proof (with input from Bernstein) of Kazhdan-Lusztig's connjectures in 1980, and his paper with Bernstein on what is now called Be&#301;linson-Bernstein localization theorem, which lead to influx of the algebraic methods involving algebraic D-modules to representation theory. With Kazhdan, Be&#301;linson has used D-modules in the proof of Jantzen's conjecture, where he introduced the noton of [[D-affinity]] and the geometric viewpoint via D-schemes. In the work on Hitchin fibration and Hitchin integrable system (with Drinfel'd) much of technique of algebraic geometry on ind-schemes, including study of D-modules is developed and used. In similar spirit to D-modules, he was also using perverse modules; with [[Ofer Gabber]], Bernstein and Deligne he developed their basic theory including deep and extremely powerful theorem for usage in representation theory, the **decomposition theorem** (see a survey: [pdf](http://www.ams.org/bull/2009-46-04/S0273-0979-09-01260-9/S0273-0979-09-01260-9.pdf)). On technical side, he also described appropriate gluing procedure for the derived categories of perverse sheaves, involving t-structures. 

Be&#301;linson has shown a remarkable structure of the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on projective spaces, and its connections to quivers. This work, together with subsequent work with [[Joseph Bernstein]] and also later works of [[Mikhail Kapranov]] and [[Alexei Bondal]] marked the birth of the [[derived algebraic geometry]]. With [[Victor Ginzburg]], [[Yuri Manin|Manin]], [[Wolfgang Soergel]] and others, Be&#301;linson introduced a wide picture of "Koszul duality patterns" in [[representation theory]]. 

His other works concentrated on motives, [[differential graded category|DG-categories]], epsilon-factors, study of regulators and so on.
