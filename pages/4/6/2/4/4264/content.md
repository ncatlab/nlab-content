Given a [[topological space]] $X$, the [[open subspaces]] of $X$ form a [[poset]] which is in fact a [[frame]].  This is the __frame of open subspaces__ of $X$.  When thought of as a [[locale]], this is the __[[topological locale]]__ $\Omega(X)$.  When thought of as a [[category]], this is the __[[category of open subsets]]__ of $X$.

Similarly, given a [[locale]] $X$, the open subspaces of $X$ form a poset which is in fact a frame.  This is the __frame of open subspaces__ of $X$.  When thought of as a locale, this is simply $X$ all over again.  When thought of as a category, this is a [[site]] whose [[topos of sheaves]] is a __[[localic topos]]__.
