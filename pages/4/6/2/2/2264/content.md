A __Mal'cev operation__ on a [[set]] $X$ is a ternary operation, a [[function]]

$$ t:X\times X\times X\to X,\,\,\,(x,y,z)\mapsto t(x,y,z) ,$$

which satisfies the identities $t(x,x,z)=z$ and $t(x,z,z)=x$.
An important motivating example is the operation $t$ of a [[heap]]. 


An [[algebraic theory]] $T$ is a __Mal'cev theory__ when $T$ contains a Mal'cev operation. An algebraic theory is Mal'cev iff one of the following equivalent statements is true:

1. in the category of $T$-algebras, every [[internal relation|internal]] [[reflexive relation]] is a [[congruence]];

2. in the category of $T$-algebras, the composite (as internal relations) of any two congruences as a congruence;

3. in the category of $T$-algebras, the composition of equivalence relations is commutative.

Statement (i) is one of the motivations to introduce the notion of [[Mal'cev category]]. 


A __Mal'cev variety__ is the category of $T$-algebras for a Mal'cev theory $T$, thought of as an [[algebraic variety]].
