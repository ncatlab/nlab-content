Given a [[category with weak equivalences]] $Core(C) \hookrightarrow W \hookrightarrow C$, its _homotopy category_ $Ho_C$ is the [[category]] which is universal with the property that there is a [[functor]]

$$
 p :  C \to Ho_C
$$

which sends every weak equivalence to an [[isomorphism]]:

$$
  P : W \to Core(C)
  \,.
