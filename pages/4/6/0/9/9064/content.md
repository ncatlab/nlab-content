## Idea

An **$(\infty,1)$-pushout**  is a [[colimit in an (∞,1)-category]] $\mathcal{C}$ over a [[diagram]] of the shape

$$
  \{a \leftarrow c \to b\} \to \mathcal{C}
  \,.
$$

In other words it is a [[cocone]]

$$
  \array{
    C &\to& B
    \\
    \downarrow &\cong\swArrow& \downarrow
    \\
    A &\to& A \sqcup_C B
  }
$$

which is [[universal property|universal]] among all such cocones in the $(\infty,1)$-categorical sense.

This is the analog in [[(∞,1)-category theory]] of the notion of [[pushout]] in [[category theory]].
