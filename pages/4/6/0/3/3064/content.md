## Idea

Nonabelian [[groupoid cohomology]] is the [[nonabelian cohomology]] of [[groupoid]]s. 

This generalizes [[nonabelian group cohomology]], which is the special case of nonabelian group cohomology for [[groupoid]]s that are [[delooping]]s $\mathbf{B}G$ of groups $G$.

## Examples

### Atiyah Lie groupoid

The [[Atiyah Lie groupoid]] $At(P) \to \Pi(X)$ of a [[principal bundle]] $P \to X$ is the extension of $\Pi(X)$ classified by the nonabelian groupoid cocycle $\Pi(X) \to \mathbf{B} AUT(G)$ coming from a [[connection on a bundle|conneciton]] on $P$.
