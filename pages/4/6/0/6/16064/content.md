(Higher) Chow groups with modulus are supposed to be a relative version of [[motivic cohomology]] (with respect to some divisor).  They do not satisfy $\mathbf{A}^1$-homotopy invariance, but rather the weaker condition of [[reciprocity sheaf|reciprocity]] in the sense of Kahn-Saito-Yamakazi.  It is expected that the various [[motives|motivic categories]] should embed into larger categories of non-homotopy invariant motives.  In these latter categories there should be a relative version of the motivic [[Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectrum]], representing [[motivic cohomology]] with modulus (= higher Chow groups with modulus).
