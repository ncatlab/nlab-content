#Idea#

It is a general phenomenon that

 * Nice objects tend to live in non-nice categories. 
  
 * Nice categories tend to contain non-nice objects.

Here we take a category to be the "nicer" the more limits, colimits etc. it admits.

On the other hand, a "nice object" is, loosely speaking, an object in some context which has more special properties than the generic object in that context will have. For instance [[manifold]]s are nice objects in the context of [[generalized smooth space|generalized smooth spaces]].

Clearly, the more extra properties one imposes, the less likely it is that these are preserved under limits and colimits. For instance 

* not all quotients $X/G$ of a manifold $X$ by the action of a group $G$ are again manifolds (this is a colimit which fails to exist);

* not all fiber products $Y \times_X Y$ of surjections $Y \to X$ of manifolds are again manifolds (this is a limit that fails to exist).


#Formalization#

The notion of "nice objects" can be formalized to some degree for instance in terms of _Isbell self-duality_ as described in
