## Idea

An _iterated integral_ is a expression of nested operations of [[integration of differential forms]] of the kind as it appears in the formulation of [[parallel transport]] for nonabelian-value [[connection on a bundle|connection]] form.

Applied to higher degree forms iterated integrals serve to express generalized [[transgression]] of differential forms to [[loop spaces]] and other [[mapping spaces]] relaized as [[diffeological spaces]].


## References

The notion originates in informal observation like the [[Dyson formula]] for [[parallel transport]]. It was formalized in the context of [[differential geometry]] on [[diffeological spaces]] ([[Chen spaces]]) (especially [[loop spaces]]) in
