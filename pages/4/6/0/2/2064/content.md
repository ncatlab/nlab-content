## Idea

A _fibre bundle_ or _fiber bundle_ is a [[bundle]] in which every [[fibre]] is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]], in some coherent way, to a _standard fibre_ or _typical fiber_. Usually one also requires that it be [[locally trivial]], hence locally of the form of a [[Cartesian product]] with that typical fiber.



## Definitions

In the most general sense, a __bundle__ over an object $B$ in a [[category]] $C$ is a [[morphism]] $p: E \to B$ in $C$.

In appropriate contexts, a __fibre bundle__ over $B$ with standard fibre $F$ may be defined as a bundle over $B$ such that, given any [[global element]] $x: 1 \to B$, the [[pullback]] of $E$ along $x$ is isomorphic to $F$. 
Certainly this definition is appropriate whenever $C$ has a [[terminal object]] $1$ which is a [[separator]], as in a [[well-pointed category]]; even then, however, one often wants the more restrictive notion below.

One often writes a typical fibre bundle in shorthand as $F \to E \to B$ or
$$ \array {
   F & \rightarrow & E \\
     &             & \downarrow \\
     &             & B
} $$
even though there is not a single morphism $F \to E$ but instead one for each global element $x$ (and none at all if $B$ has no global elements!).

If $C$ is a [[site]], then a __[[locally trivial|locally]] [[trivial fibre bundle]]__ over $B$ with typical fibre $F$ is a bundle over $B$ with a [[cover]] $(j_\alpha: U_\alpha \to B)_\alpha$ such that, for each index $\alpha$, the pullback $E_\alpha$ of $E$ along $j_\alpha$ is isomorphic in the [[slice category]] $C/{U_\alpha}$ to the [[trivial bundle]] $U_\alpha \times F$ (a _[[local trivialization]]_).

One can also drop $F$ and define a slightly more general notion of __[[locally trivial]] bundle__ over $B$ as a bundle over $B$ with a cover $(j_\alpha: U_\alpha \to B)_\alpha$ such that, for each index $\alpha$, there is a fibre $F_\alpha$ and an isomorphism in $C/{U_\alpha}$ between the pullback $E_\alpha$ and the trivial bundle $U_\alpha \times F_\alpha$.  Every [[locally trivial]] fibre bundle is obviously a locally trivial bundle; the converse holds if $B$ is [[connected object|connected]].

+-- {: #TransitionMorphisms}
Now suppose that $E$ is a fibre bundle over $B$ with standard fibre $F$, locally trivialised using the cover $(U_\alpha)_\alpha$ and isomorphisms $(t_\alpha : E_\alpha \simeq U_\alpha\times F)_\alpha$.  Given an index $\alpha$ and an index $\beta$, let $U_{\alpha,\beta}$ be the [[fibred product]] (pullback) of $U_\alpha$ and $U_\beta$. Note that we can pull back the commutative triangle formed by $t_\alpha$ along $j_\alpha^*j_\beta$ to get a new isomorphism $t_{\alpha,\beta} : E_{\alpha,\beta} \simeq U_{\alpha,\beta} \times F$:

\begin{centre}

\end{centre}

Then we have an [[automorphism]] $g_{\alpha,\beta}$ of $U_{\alpha,\beta} \times F$ in $C/{U_{\alpha,\beta}}$ given by $g_{\alpha,\beta} = t_{\beta,\alpha} \circ t_{\alpha,\beta}^{-1}$. The $g_{\alpha,\beta}$ are the __transition morphisms__ of the locally trivial fibre bundle $E$.

If $E$ in fact admits a *global* [[trivial fiber bundle|trivialisation]] $t : E \simeq B \times F$, then one can see that the two isomorphisms $t_{\alpha,\beta}$ and $t_{\beta,\alpha}$ are equal to the pullback of (the commutative triangle formed by) $t$ along $j_{\alpha,\beta} : U_{\alpha,\beta} \to B$, so that the transition morphisms $g_{\alpha,\beta}$ are all [[identity morphism|identities]].
=--

Often one considers special kinds of bundles, by requiring structure on the standard fibre $F$ and/or conditions on the transition morphisms $g_{\alpha,\beta}$.  For example:

## Special cases 

### $G$-bundle 

If $G$ is a [[group object]] in $C$ that [[action|acts]] on $F$, then a __$G$-bundle__ (or bundle with __structure group__ $G$) over $B$ with standard fibre $F$ is a locally trivial fibre bundle over $B$ with standard fibre $F$ together with morphisms $U_{\alpha,\beta} \to G$ that, relative to the action of $G$ on $F$, give the transition maps $g_{\alpha,\beta}$.  (The morphism $U_{\alpha,\beta} \to G$ is also written $g_{\alpha,\beta}$, conflating action with application.)

### $G$-principal bundles 

More specifically, a (right or left) __[[principal bundle|principal]] $G$-bundle__ over $B$ is a $G$-bundle over $B$ with standard fibre $G$, associated with the action of $G$ on itself by (right or left) multiplication.

### Structure-preserving bundles 

If $F$ is an object of a [[concrete category]] over $C$, then we can consider locally trivial fibre bundles with standard fibre $F$ such that the transition morphisms are structure-preserving morphisms.  If the [[automorphism group]] $Aut(F)$ can be internalised in $C$, then this the same as an $Aut(F)$-bundle, but the concept makes sense in any case.

### Vector bundles 

As a fairly specific example, if $F$ is a [[topological vector space]] (and $C$ is a category with structure to support this, such as [[Top]] or [[Diff]]), then a __[[vector bundle]]__ over $B$ with standard fibre $F$ is a $GL(F)$-bundle over $B$ with standard fibre $F$, where $GL(F)$ is the [[general linear group]] with its defining action on $F$.

### Associated bundles 

Given a right [[principal bundle|principal]] $G$-bundle $\pi: P\to X$ and a left $G$-space $F$, all in a sufficiently strong category $C$ (such as [[Top]]), one can form the [[quotient object]] $P\times_G F = (P\times F)/{\sim}$, where $P \times F$ is a [[product]] and $\sim$ is the smallest [[congruence]] such that (using [[generalized element]]s) $(p g,f)\sim (p,g f)$; there is a canonical projection $P\times_G F\to X$ where the class of $(p,f)$ is mapped to $\pi(p)\in X$, hence making $P\times_G F\to X$ into a fibre bundle with typical fiber $F$, and the transition functions belonging to the action of $G$ on $F$. We say that  $P\times_G F\to X$ is the __[[associated bundle]]__ to $P\to X$ with fiber $F$. 

## Generalizations

### In higher category theory

In [[higher category theory]] the notion of fiber bundle generalizes. See

* [[associated ∞-bundle]].

### In commutative algebra

Under the interpretation of [modules as generalized vector bundles](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/module#RelationToVectorBundlesInIntroduction), locally trivial fiber bundles correspond to _[[locally free modules]]_. See there for more.

### In noncommutative geometry 

In [[noncommutative geometry]] both principal and associated bundles have analogues. The principal bundles over noncommutative spaces typically have structure group replaced by a [[Hopf algebra]]; the most well-known class whose base is described by a single algebra are [[Hopf--Galois extensions]]; the global sections of the associated bundle are formed using cotensor product. Transition functions can be to some extent emulated using noncommutative localizations, which yield nonaffine generalizations of Hopf--Galois extensions. Another generalization is when Hopf--Galois extensions in the sense of comodule algebras are replaced by entwining structures with analogous Galois condition. 

## Properties

### Relation to fibrations
 {#RelationToFibrations}

\begin{prop}

Every [[locally trivial]] topological fiber bundle projection is a [[Serre fibration]], and a [[Hurewicz fibration]] if it is also a [[numerable bundle]].

\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
  It is clear that the [[projection]] out of a [[Cartesian product]] is a [[Serre fibration]]. With this, the statement follows from [[local triviality]] and the local recognition of Serre fibrations ([this Prop](Serre+fibration#MapIsSerreFibrationIfLocallySo)) and of [[Hurewicz fibrations]] ([this Prop.](Hurewicz+fibration#MapIsHurewiczFibrationIfPullbackToNumerableCoverIsSo)), respectively.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
  Beware that the converse statement is far from being true.
\end{remark}
