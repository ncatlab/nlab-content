There is a sequence of extra [[stuff, structure, property|structure and property]] on a [[category]] that makes this category behave like a general context for [[homological algebra]]. In order of increasing structure and property this is:

1. **[[Ab-enriched category]]**:
  a [[category]] that is [[Ab]]-[[enriched category|enriched]];

1. **[[pre-additive category]]**:
  an $Ab$-enriched category that has a [[terminal object]] or [[initial object]] and therefore a [[zero object]];

1. **[[additive category]]**: a pre-additive category that admits binary [[product]]s or binary [[coproduct]]s and therefore binary [[biproduct]]s (equivalently, an $Ab$-enriched category with all finite products or coproducts);

1. **[[pre-abelian category]]**:
  an additive category that admits [[kernel]]s and  [[cokernel]]s (equivalently, an $Ab$-enriched category with all finite [[limit]]s and [[colimit]]s);

1. **[[abelian category]]**:
  a pre-abelian category such that every [[monomorphism]] is a kernel and every [[epimorphism]] is a cokernel (and many other equivalent definitions).

Pre-abelian and abelian categories are sometimes called (AB1) and (AB2) categories, after the sequence of axioms introduced by Grothendieck in [[Tohoku]].  These continue:

* AB3: an abelian category with all coproducts and products (hence with all [[colimit]]s and [[limit]]s);

* AB4: an (AB3) category in which coproducts of monomorphisms are monic and products of epimorphisms are epic;

* AB5: an (AB3) category in which [[filtered limit|filtered colimits and cofiltered limit]]s of [[exact sequence]]s are exact;

* AB6: ... (not in Wikipedia for some reason).

The concepts (AB3--6) can also be split into independent colimit-like and limit-like parts.

#Further refinements#

Various further axiom structures are considered and of relevance on additive and abelian categories.

* [[suspended category]]

* [[triangulated category]]

* [[Quillen exact category]]


#Examples#

Various generic classes of examples of additive and abelian categories are of relevance:
