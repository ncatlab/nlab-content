There is a sequence of extra [[stuff, structure, property|structure and property]] on a [[category]] that makes this category behave like a general context for [[homological algebra]]. In order of increasing structure and property this is:

1. **[[pre-additive category]]**:
  a [[category]] that is [[Ab-enriched category|Ab-enriched]];

1. **[[additive category]]**: a [[pre-additive category]] that admits finite [[product]]s and therefore finite [[coproduct]]s and [[biproduct]]s;

1. **[[pre-abelian category]]**:
  an [[additive category]] that admits [[kernel]]s and  [[cokernel]]s (equivalently, a pre-additive category with all finite limits and colimits);

1. **[[abelian category]]**:
  a [[pre-abelian category]] such that every [[monomorphism]] is a [[kernel]] and every [[epimorphism]] is a [[cokernel]] (and many other equivalent definitions).

Pre-abelian and abelian categories are sometimes called (AB1) and (AB2) categories, after the sequence of axioms introduced by Grothendieck in [[Tohoku]].  These continue:

* AB3: an abelian category with all coproducts and products (hence with all [[colimit]]s and [[limit]]s);

* AB4: an (AB3) category in which coproducts of monomorphisms are monic and products of epimorphisms are epic;

* AB5: an (AB3) category in which [[filtered limit|filtered colimits and cofiltered limit]]s of [[exact sequence]]s are exact;

* AB6: ... (not in Wikipedia for some reason).

The concepts (AB3--6) can also be split into independent colimit-like and limit-like parts.
