Given a [[topological group]] $G$ the __orbit category__ $\mathrm{Or}\, G$ (denoted also $\mathcal{O}_G$) is a (usually [[skeleton|skeletal]]) category whose objects are homogeneous spaces ($G$-orbit types) $G/H$ where $H$ is a closed subgroup of $G$ and morphisms are $G$-equivariant maps.

More generally, given a family $F$ of subgroups of $G$ which is closed under conjugation and taking subgroups one looks at the full subcategory $\mathrm{Or}_F\,G \subset \mathrm{Or}\,G$ whose objects are those $G/H$ for which $H\in F$.

Orbit categories are used often in the treatment of [[Mackey functor]]s from the theory of [[locally compact group]]s and in the definition of [[Bredon cohomology]].

This should not be confused with the situation where a group $G$ acts on a groupoid $\Gamma$ so that one obtains the  [[orbit groupoid]].
