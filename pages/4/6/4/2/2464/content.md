For $\pi : Y \to X$ a morphism of smooth [[manifold]]s, the **vertical tangent Lie algebroid** with respect to $\pi$ is the sub-[[Lie algebroid]] $T_{vert} Y \hookrightarrow T X $ of the [[tangent Lie algebroid]] $T Y$ of $Y$ whose [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] is the [[dg-algebra]] of horizontal differential forms on $Y$ with respect to $\pi$.

For more details on the construction see the examples section at [[exterior differential system]]s.

The vertical tangent Lie algebroid is the infinitesimal version of the [[schreiber:Ehresmann ∞-connection|vertical path ∞-groupoid]]. It plays a central role in the context of [[Ehresmann connection]]s and [[schreiber:Cartan-Ehresmann ∞-connection|Cartan-Ehresmann ∞-connections]].
