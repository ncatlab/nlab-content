## Idea

What has come to be called _Iwasaw-Tate theory_ is a method of expressing [[zeta functions]], [[L-functions]] and [[theta functions]] as [[adelic integrals]] over [[idele groups]] and deriving this way their fundamental properties such as [[analytic continuation]] and their [[functional equation]].

[[John Tate]] in his thesis ([Tate 50](#Tate50)) had generalized the notion of [[zeta function]] according to his advisor [[Emil Artin]] from "the sum over integral ideals of certain type of ideal character" to

> the [[adelic integral]] over the [[id√®le group]] of a rather general weight function times the id&#232;le character which is trivial on field elements. The role of Hecke's complicated theta-formulas for [[theta functions]] formed over a lattice in $n$-dimensional space of classical number theory can be played by a simple [[Poisson formula]] for general function of valuation vectors, summed over the discrete subgroup of field elements

[[Kenkichi Iwasawa]] in [Iwasawa 5x](#Iwasawa50) has rediscovered and extended this approach using the wider study of [[invariant integration]] on locally compact groups over ideles. Distinguish from related but different subject of Iwasawa theory (cf. [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iwasawa_theory))
