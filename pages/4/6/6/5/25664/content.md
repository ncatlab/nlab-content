# Pseudoorientation

## Idea

For a $k$-[[submanifold]] $U$ of an $n$-[[manifold]] $X$, an _orientation_ of $U$ is an [[orientation]] of $U$ itself as a $k$-manifold. A _pseudoorientation_, by contrast, can be thought of as an orientation of the remaining $n-k$ dimensions of how $X$ sits around $U$.

An orientation of $U$ may be visualized with a set of arrows lying within $U$. A pseudoorientation is properly visualized instead with a set of arrows passing through $U$, or circulating around it.


## Definition

\begin{definition}
Given a $k$-submanifold $U$ of an $n$-manifold $X$, a __pseudoorientation__ of $U$ is a map that, for each point $a$ on $U$, takes a local orientation of $X$ at $a$ to a local orientation of $U$ at $a$, continuously in $a$ and taking opposite orientations to opposite orientations.
\end{definition}


## Properties

A pseudoorientation is precisely the added structure one needs in order to [[integrate|integration of differential forms]] over $U$ a $k$-[[pseudoform]] on $X$. This is much like how if one has instead an untwisted $k$-[[form|differential form]] on $X$ and wants to integrate it over $U$, one needs an orientation of $U$. For details, see [[integration of differential forms]].

When one has an orientation of the containing manifold $X$, that gives a correspondence between orientations and pseudoorientations for any submanifold $U$. As a result, many treatments conflate orientations with pseudoorientations.
