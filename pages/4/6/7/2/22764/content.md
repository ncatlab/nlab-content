## Idea

The idea of a closed midpoint algebra comes from [[Peter Freyd]]. 

## Definition

A __closed midpoint algebra__ is a [[cancellative midpoint algebra]] $(M,\vert)$ with two elements $\bot:M$ and $\top:M$. 

## Examples

The [[unit interval]] with $a \vert b \coloneqq \frac{a + b}{2}$, $\bot = 0$, and $\top = 1$ is an example of a closed midpoint algebra. 

The [[trivial group]] with $a \vert b = a \cdot b$ and $\top = \bot = 1$ is a closed midpoint algebra.
