_under construction_

## Idea

The Gelfand--Naimark--Segal (GNS) construction establishes a correspondence between cyclic $*$-representations of $C^*$-[[C*-algebra|algebras]] and certain linear functionals (usually called _states_) on those same $C^*$-algebras.  The correspondence comes about from an explicit construction of the [[star-representation|*-representation]] from one of the [[linear functionals|linear functionals]] (states).


## GNS construction

###### Theorem

Given a state, $\rho$, on some C*-algebra, $A$, there is a $*$-representation $\pi$ of $A$ with a cyclic vector $\xi$ whose associated state is $\rho$.  In other words,

$$
  \rho(x)= \langle \xi, \pi(x)\xi \rangle
$$

for every $x$ in $A$.

_and this needs to be finished.  I don't have the head for this right now._
