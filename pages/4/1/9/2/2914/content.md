## Definition ##

For $C$ a [[model category]] and $X \in C$ an [[object]], the [[over category]] $C/X$ as well as the undercategory $X/C$ inherit themselves structures of model categories whose fibrations, cofibrations and weak equivalences are precisely the morphism that are fibrations, cofibrations and weak equivalences in $C$ under the forgetful functor $C/X \to C$ or $X/C \to C$.

## Properties ##

If $C$ is

* a [[cofibrantly generated model category]]

* or a [[proper model category]]

* or a [[cellular model category]]

then so is $C/X$ and $X/C$.

The proofs are in _OvMod_ .
