## Definition ##

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition


For $C$ a [[model category]] and $X \in C$ an [[object]], the [[over category]] $C/X$ as well as the [[undercategory]] $X/C$ inherit themselves structures of model categories whose [[fibrations]], [[cofibration]]s and [[weak equivalences]] are precisely the morphism that become fibrations, cofibrations and weak equivalences in $C$ under the forgetful functor $C/X \to C$ or $X/C \to C$.

## Properties ##

###### Proposition


If $C$ is

* a [[cofibrantly generated model category]]

* or a [[proper model category]]

* or a [[cellular model category]]

then so are $C/X$ and $X/C$.
