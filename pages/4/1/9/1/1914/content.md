A __diffeomorphism__ is an [[isomorphism]] in [[Diff]].

In more elementary detail, a diffeomorphism is a smooth map $f: X \to Y$ beween [[manifolds]] or [[generalized smooth spaces]] that (when viewed as a mere [[function]]) is a [[bijection]] and so has an inverse map $f^{-1}$, such that $f^{-1}$ is also smooth.
