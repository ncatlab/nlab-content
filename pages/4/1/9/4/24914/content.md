## Idea

In [[class theory]], a universal class is a "[[class]] of all [[sets]]". 

## Definition

### In material class theory

to be defined...

### In structural class theory

A **universal class** is a [[class]] $U$ such that for all classes $C$, there is a [[monic]] class [[map]] $U \hookrightarrow C$. 

There should also be a definition from a hypothetical "[[division allegory]] with class structure" rather than a [[category with class structure]].
