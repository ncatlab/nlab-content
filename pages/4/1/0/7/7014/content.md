## Idea

In [[type theory]], regarding [[propositions as types]], a [[proof]] of a [[proposition]] is given by [[constructive mathematics|constructing]] a [[term]] of the corresponding [[type]]. This can hence be regarded as a [[program]] to compute a specific term (output). 

## References

That [[Martin-Löf dependent type theory]] can be regarded also as a [[functional programming language]] by identifying proofs as programs was stressed in
