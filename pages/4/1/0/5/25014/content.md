## Idea

The *common* meaning of "an inequality" in [[mathematics]] is the statement that a given [[pair]] of expressions, $x, y$, with values in some [[linear order|linearly ordered]] [[set]] of [[numbers]] (such as [[natural number|natural]], [[rational numbers|rational]] or [[real numbers]]) are in ordered [[relation]] to each other, such as 

$$
  x \lt y
$$

or

$$
  x \gt y
  \mathrlap{\,.}
$$

This is in contrast to the statement of their *[[equality]]*

$$ 
  x = y
  \mathrlap{\,,}
$$

whence the terminology  --- but, of course, there are other ways in which a pair of expressions can be "in-equal".
Generally, inequality may  just be the statement that a pair of [[terms]] of any [[type]] are *not equal*, though in non-classical [[foundations of mathematics]] there may be slightly different notions of "inequality" in this general sense, see the disambiguation [below](#Disambiguation).






## Disambiguation
 {#Disambiguation}

In [[classical mathematics]], *inequality* is simply the [[negation]] ($\not$) of [[equality]] ($=$). However, in [[constructive mathematics]], due to the lack of [[excluded middle]], there are multiple different notions of inequality. These include:

* [[denial inequality]]
* [[tight apartness relation]]

More generally, an *inequality relation* is a [[relation]] $\neq$ which satisfies

* $\neg(a \neq a)$
* $a \neq b$ implies $b \neq a$
* $\neg \neg(a = b)$ if and only if $\neg (a \neq b)$

There are also the more general relations which do not make reference to [[equality]] at all, which are sometimes called "inequality":

* [[apartness relation]]
* [[irreflexive symmetric relation]]
