In [[classical mathematics]], inequality is simply the negation of [[equality]]. However, in [[constructive mathematics]], due to the lack of [[excluded middle]], there are multiple different notions of inequality. These include:

* [[denial inequality]]
* [[tight apartness relation]]

More generally, an inequality relation is a relation $\neq$ which satisfies

* $\neg(a \neq a)$
* $a \neq b$ implies $b \neq a$
* $\neg \neg(a = b)$ if and only if $\neg (a \neq b)$

There are also the more general relations which do not make reference to [[equality]] at all, which are sometimes called "inequality":

* [[apartness relation]]
* [[irreflexive symmetric relation]]
