## Idea

The *common* meaning of "an inequality" in [[mathematics]] is the statement that a given [[pair]] of expressions, $x, y$, with values in some [[linear order|linearly ordered]] [[set]] of [[numbers]] (such as [[natural number|natural]], [[rational numbers|rational]] or [[real numbers]]) are in ordered [[relation]] to each other, such as 

$$
  x \lt y
$$

or

$$
  x \gt y
  \mathrlap{\,.}
$$

This is in contrast to the statement of their *[[equality]]*

$$ 
  x = y
  \mathrlap{\,,}
$$

whence the terminology  --- but, of course, there are other ways in which a pair of expressions can be "in-equal".

## Inequality relations

Generally, inequality may just be the statement that a pair of [[terms]] of any [[type]] are *not equal*. However, in the [[foundations of mathematics]], sometimes one talks about a particular relation called the *inequality relation*. In [[classical mathematics]], the *inequality relation* is defined as the [[negation]] ($\not$) of [[equality]] ($=$). However, in [[constructive mathematics]], due to the lack of [[excluded middle]], there are multiple different notions of inequality relation. The two most commonly used notions are the [[denial inequality relation]] and the [[tight apartness relation]], the latter of which is used to define [[inequality spaces]]. Other relations which have been called "inequality relation" in the constructive mathematics literature are listed in [[irreflexive symmetric relation#ConstructiveMathematics]].
