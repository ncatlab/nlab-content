## Idea

In generalization of how a [[bilinear map]] is a [[function]] of two arguments which is suitably [[linear map|linear]] in each argument, so a *multilinear map* is a function of any number of $n$ of arguments which is suitably [[linear map|linear]] in each of them.

For $n = 3$ one also speaks of *trilinear maps*, etc.

Concretely, a multilinear map of elements of [[abelian groups]] is equivlalently a single [[linear map]] out of the [[tensor product of abelian groups|tensor product]] of all its [[domains]].
There is a [[multicategory]] [[Ab]] of [[abelian groups]] and [[multilinear maps]] between them. The [[bilinear maps]] are the [[binary morphisms]], and the multilinear maps are the [[multimorphisms]].
