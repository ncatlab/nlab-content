#History#

The [[HomePage|nLab]] is a _collaborative [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki)_ which has grown out of the desire ([I](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2007/09/towards_a_higherdimensional_wi.html), [II](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/11/beyond_the_blog.html)) of an on-line community communicating via the weblog [The <em>n</em>-Category Caf&eacute;](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/) of people interested in discussion of expository and research nature about [[mathematics]], [[physics]] and [[philosophy]] in the light of [[category theory]] and [[higher category theory]] (the "$n$" in "$n$Lab") to have a place for development (the "Lab" in "$n$Lab") and indexed archivation of the ideas and concepts that were, are and will be subject of or that developed out of the discussion at the weblog.

The $n$Lab was [created](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/11/nlab.html) in November 2008 using software provided and set up by [[Jacques Distler]].

##Technology behind the $n$Lab##

The site is running [[Jacques Distler]]'s enhanced version of [Instiki](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/instiki/show/HomePage). To see the content correctly, you need to be running a [MathML-capable browser](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/instiki/show/Browsers).

The site is served using [Mongrel](http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/). It is hosted on a [256MB Virtual Private Server](http://www.a2hosting.com/services/vps-hosting/), running [CentOS](http://www.centos.org/), from [A2 Hosting](http://www.a2hosting.com/).


#What the $n$Lab is and what it is not#

By design, the $n$Lab is a collaborative project which can and will have to grow incrementally. 

The precise nature and purpose of the $n$Lab will to a large extent have to show itself and will depend on the intentions of those who decide to contribute to it. Currently it seems that common motivations for contributing to the $n$Lab are 

 * to **assemble information** on [[mathematics]], [[physics]] and [[philosophy]] in a modern unified way, from the perspective of [[higher category theory]];

* to **provide exposition** of this information which is useful to a wide range of readers of differing expertise;

 * to jointly **develop ideas** and research on applying higher categorical concepts and tools to issues in [[mathematics]], [[physics]] and [[philosophy]].


To some extent this proves to involve 

* collecting in principle "well known" definitions and facts in an encyclopedic fashion, to the extent that these are not readily available, or not in the desired form, for instance on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page). Depending on the enthusiasm of those who decide to contribute, this _could_ eventually develop into something like a modern version of a [Bourbaki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbaki)-like project. The potential for this is conceivably there, but of course this is an ambitious idea. Time will show if the $n$Lab can live up to this goal.

But on top of this encyclopedic function, and hopefully in parallel to that, the $n$Lab is 

* intended as providing a _laboratory_ for collaborative development of ideas -- for research. Within the community out of which the $n$Lab grew exists the feeling that there is considerable potential for the fruitful application and development of categorical and higher categorical concepts and tools to various areas in [[mathematics]], [[physics]] and [[philosophy]]. Several contributors to the $n$Lab are actively involved in research along these lines.
The $n$Lab is meant as a place to collect, develop and present such research.


These points together imply that

* on the $n$Lab we do not hesitate to provide non-traditional perspectives, definitions and explanations of terms and phenomena if we feel that these are the _right_ perspectives, definitions and explanations from a modern unified higher categorical perspective;

* at the same time we want to indicate clearly which part of an entry is traditional common material, which is a modern but widely-accepted reformulation and which is genuinely the result of original research by a contributor or by several contributors;

* we will intersperse possibly controversial but always constructive **discussion** into entries if we feel the need. While in general the [nCategory Caf&eacute;](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category) is where we have chat and discussion and the $n$Lab is where we compile material, few entries on the $n$Lab are or can be meant as representing a final truth. The $n$Lab will be the better the more we discuss its contents. For more on how to inject discussion into entries see the [[HowTo]] page.


##What the $n$Lab is not

Most importantly the $n$Lab is 

* **not complete** and **not meant to be complete**. Neither its general structure nor each single entry are meant to be optimal in their current state. Many existing entries, possibly all of them, deserve to be and are meant to be eventually improved and expanded on. 
Many entries are [stubs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub)!

**If you find yourself annoyed by the state any given entry is in**, for whatever reason, please feel encouraged to edit it in order to improve the situation. If you feel existing material needs to be changed, you can do so. If you feel further material needs to be added, different perspectives need to be amplified, you can add new paragraph, headed by a suitable headline. The $n$Lab will be the better the more people decide to contribute to it.

See the [[HowTo]] page for information on how to contribute to the $n$Lab and edit and/or create its entries.
