## Idea

The term **quotient category** has more than one meaning.

1. Sometimes it refers to the [[Serre quotient category]] by a [[thick subcategory]].  In this case it is not the category that *is* a quotient, but its *objects* are quotients.  This is an instance of a [[localization functor]], often a [[strict localization functor]].

1. Other times, it refers to an actual quotient of some kind in [[Cat]].  There are different possible meanings of this, but one of the more useful is the quotient of the homsets of a category by equivalence relations compatible with composition.
