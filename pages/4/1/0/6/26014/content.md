## Idea

Traditionally, a [[symmetry]] is defined as invariance (e.g. of a Physical system) under a [[group]] [[action]]. This definition is well-suited for Physical systems such as [[classical mechanics]], where they appear as [[symplectomorphism]]s. However, many systems of interest depart, or **generalize**, from this setting in two different ways: as a [[classical field theory]], or as a [[quantum system]] (or as both, as a [[quantum field theory]]). A natural question to ask is what happens to the mathematical objects realizing the notion of symmetry when these generalizations are considered. The former case leads to the [[vertical categorification]] of groups, as observed in [[higher prequantum geometry]]. The latter case leads to a [[ring]] (or [[algebra]]) structure. The concept of **generalized symmetries** is thought to be the appropriate notion of symmetry when both of these generalizations take place at the same time. As emphasized in ([FMT20](#FMT22)), these are thought to be controlled by [[higher algebra]]. In this sense, the concept may be better understood as **higher quantum symmetries** (even though the name "quantum symmetries" is already used in the Physics literature for a "dual" symmetry that arises after gauging a symmetry, originating in ([Vafa89](#Vafa89))).

Historically, the name came about in ([GKSW14](#GKSW14)). As described therein, and at a very formal level, classical symmetries (described by a group) that survive the quantization process are thought to become operators that can be "inserted" along submanifold of a given dimension. These operators are supposed to be "topological", in the sense that they should only depend on the homology class of said submanifold. ([GKSW14](#GKSW14)) proposes to regard any quantum operator with the topological property as a symmetry of the quantum system even if they do not have inverses. It is in this sense that the concept of symmetry is regarded as being generalized.

The upshot is that just as groups correctly describe the symmetries of classical mechanics, higher algebra is thought to describe the symmetries of a quantum field theory.
