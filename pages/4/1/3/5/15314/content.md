## Idea

The [[Beilinson-Deligne cup product]] of two [[holomorphic functions]] $f,g \in H^0(X,\mathbb{G}_m)$ is a [[holomorphic line bundle]] with connection, hence a degree-2 [[cocycle]] in [[Deligne cohomology]]

$$
  f \cup g \in H^2(X, \mathbb{Z} \to \Omega^0 \to \Omega^1)
  \,.
$$

This kind of line bundle is often referred to as the _Deligne line bundle_, following ([Deligne 91](#Deligne91)).

They were originally motivated and used in a geometric construction of the [[Beilinson regulartor]] $c_{2,2}$, see at _[Beilinson regulator -- Geometic construction](higher+regulator#GeometricConstruction)_.

The universal version of this is the Deligne bundle on $\mathbb{G}_m \times \mathbb{G}_m$ with $f$ and $g$ the [[projection]] onto the first and onto the second factor, respectively (e.g. [Brylinski 00, p. 15](#Brylinski00)).
