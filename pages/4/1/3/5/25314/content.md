## Idea

Under the [[Curry-Howard correspondence]], [[proofs]] of [[intuitionistic logic]] can be seen at [[lambda-terms|$\lambda$-terms]]. In the same way, one can see proofs of [[linear logic]] as [[terms]] of a linear $\lambda$-calculus. It allows one to have a more compact syntax for proofs of linear logic which can be more practical to analyze their computational properties. Under this correspondence, the [[cut-elimination]] of proofs corresponds to the [[beta-reduction|$\beta$-reduction]] of terms.
