Eduard Čech was a Czech mathematician.

He got his PhD degree in 1920 from Charles University in Prague, advised by Karel Petr.

He was the first one to define [[homotopy groups]] (unpublished).
(An apocryphal story told about this is that [[Paul Alexandroff]] expressed
skepticism that these new invariants could be anything but [[homology groups]]
since they were abelian.)

He is also known for [[Čech methods]] in [[homotopy theory]], further developing the [[nerve]] construction by [[Paul Alexandroff]].
