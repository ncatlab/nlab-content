## Definition

For $A$ a [[simplicial infinity-groupoid|simplicial $\infty$-groupoid]], it's opposite is the simplicial $\infty$-groupoid $A^{op}$ obtained by reversing the order of all the face and degeneracy maps. 

## Properties

The operation extends to an [[automorphism|automorphic]] [[(infinity,1)-functor|$(\infty,1)$-functor]] 

$$
  (-)^\op : \infty\mathrm{Grpd}^{\Delta^\op} \to \infty\mathrm{Grpd}^{\Delta^\op}
$$

from [[∞GrpdΔop]] to itself. When the op $(\infty,1)$-functor is restricted to the $(\infty,1)$-subcategory $(\infty,1)\mathrm{Cat} \hookrightarrow \infty\mathrm{Grpd}^{\Delta^\op}$, it takes [[(infinity,1)-category|$(\infty,1)$-categories]] to its [[opposite (infinity,1)-category|opposite $(\infty,1)$-category]]. 

In [[simplicial type theory]] thought of as the [[internal logic]] of $\infty\mathrm{Grpd}^{\Delta^\op}$, the opposite simplicial $\infty$-groupoid is given by the [[op modality]].
