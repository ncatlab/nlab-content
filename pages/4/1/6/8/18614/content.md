If $A$ is a category and $I$ a small category then we can consider the [[category of functors]] $A^I$, whose objects are the functors from $I$ to $A$. If $A$ admits limits of shape $I$, then the limit $lim = lim_I:A^I\to A$ is a functor which is right adjoint to the constant diagram functor hence it commutes with limits, and in particular it is left exact. If $A$ has some notion of homotopy theory then usually $A^I$ has the notion as well (e.g. if we work with model category structures or say Abelian categories) hence we can then form right derived functors of $lim$ which are usually denoted $lim^n$ and called the derived limit functors. As usual we can also assemble them into the [[total right derived functor]] $\mathbb{R}lim$.
