## Definition

A **$\Delta$-generated space** is a [[topological space]] $X$ whose topology is the [[final structure|final topology]] induced by all maps $\Delta^n \to X$, where $\Delta^n$ runs over all the standard [[simplices]].

## Properties

The category of $\Delta$-generated spaces is [[coreflective subcategory|coreflective]] in [[Top]].  It is also [[locally presentable category|locally presentable]], and supports a [[model structure on topological spaces|model structure]].  Thus, it is a [[nice category of spaces]].

## References

$\Delta$-generated spaces were originally proposed by [[Jeff Smith]] as a nice category of spaces for homotopy theory.  A proof that they are locally presentable is in:
