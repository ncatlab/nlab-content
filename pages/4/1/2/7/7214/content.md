###### Definition
**($\Delta$-Generated spaces)**

A **$\Delta$-generated space** ([Smith](#Smith), [Dugger 03](#Dugger03)) is a [[topological space]] $X$ whose topology is the [[final structure|final topology]] induced by all [[continuous functions]] of the form $\Delta^n_{top} \to X$, hence whose [[domain]] $\Delta^n_{top}$ is one of the standard [[topological simplices]], for $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

A [[morphism]] between $\Delta$-generated spaces is just a [[continuous function]], hence the [[category]] of $\Delta$-generated spaces is the [[full subcategory]] on these spaces inside all [[Top|TopologicalSpaces]], 

=--

+-- {: .num_remark} 
###### Remark

Equivalently, the [[class]] of $\Delta$-generated spaces is the closure of the set of [[topological simplices]] $\Delta^n_{top}$ under [[small colimits]] in [[topological spaces]] (see at _[[Top]] -- [universal constructions](Top#UniversalConstructions)_).

###### Remark
**(as Euclidean-generated spaces)**

For each $n$ the [[topological simplex]] $\Delta^n$ is a [[retract]] of the ambient [[Euclidean space]]/[[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ (as a [[inhabited|non-empty]] [[convex subset]] of a [[Euclidean space]] it is in fact an [[absolute retract]]). Hence the [[identity function]] on $\Delta^n$ factors as

$$
  id 
  \;\colon\; 
  \Delta^n_{top}
  \overset{i_n}{\hookrightarrow}
  \mathbb{R}^n
  \overset{p_n}{\longrightarrow}
  \Delta^n_{top}
  \,.
$$

It follows that every [[continuous function]] $f$ with [[domain]] the [[topological simplex]] [[extension|extends]] as a [[continuous function]] to [[Euclidean space]]:

$$
  \array{
    \Delta^m_{top}
    &\overset{f}{\longrightarrow}&
    X
    \\
    \mathllap{{}^{i_n}}\big\downarrow & \nearrow _{\mathrlap{\exists}}
    \\
    \mathbb{R}^n
  }
$$

Therefore the condition that a topological space $X$ be $\Delta$-generated (Def. \ref{DeltaGeneratedSpace}) is equivalent to saying that its topology is [[final topology|final]] with respect to all continuous functions $\mathbb{R}^n \to X$ out of [[Euclidean spaces|Euclidean]]/[[Cartesian spaces]]. 

We might thus equivalently speak of _Euclidean-generated spaces_.

## Properties

### As a nice category of topological spaces

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

The [[category]] of $\Delta$-generated spaces is 
a [[convenient category of topological spaces]] in that it is:

* [[locally presentable category|locally presentable]] ([Fajstrup-Rosický 08, Cor. 3.7](#FajstrupRosicky08))

* [[cartesian closed]] ([Shimakawa-Yoshida-Haraguchi 10, Cor. 4.6](#SYH10)).

### Model category structure

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

The category of $\Delta$-generated spaces carries the [[mathematical structure|structure]] of a [[cofibrantly generated model category]] with the same generating (acyclic) cofibrations as for the [[classical model structure on topological spaces]] and such that the [[coreflective subcategory|coreflection]] into all [[Top|TopologicalSpaces]] (Prop. \ref{AdjunctionBetweenTopologicalSpacesAndDiffeologicalSpaces}) is a [[Quillen equivalence]] to the [[classical model structure on topological spaces]].
