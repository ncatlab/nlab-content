Here "non-trivial" means: anything that any other contributor might be interested in taking notice of. If you fix a trivial typo in the text somewhere, that is highly appreciated but unlikely to be controversial and hence need not be logged here. But already if you fix a typo in some _formula_, it may be of interest. Generally: the more you log your activity here, the better. Even when in doubt whether anyone else might be interested in changes you made, drop a note here on what you did.

The importance of logging changes here is that

Logging changes here is the way to allow collaboration on the $n$Lab without everybody following every individual page.

Contributions that are not logged here are likely to be missed and ignored. And that can't be the point of making a contribution. 

These comments should go in _reverse_ chronological order, so that the latest are on top of the list. To keep the list international, use the date in **UTC** (the date given by the server for your edits).  However, regardless of that, be sure to **add new comments to the top** of the list, or else people might not notice them.

## 2009-09-03
* [[Zoran Škoda]]: added some references to [[supermanifold]]. I agree with Urs that the <em>co</em>-things when the entries contain predominantly the definitions and non-specific information should be just under the things. However often the cothings are very unlike things in practice. For example, homology and cohomology in abelian categories is just the same and dual; however in geometry homology and cohomology of spaces are rather different; for example there are finiteness conditions in homology which are absent in cohomology. Naively defined &#268;ech cohomology is a cohomology theory and &#268;ech homology is not, as it fails exactness...but the coherent repair works. Or the rings. Artinian and noetherian are dual conditions, but for unital rings the unit breaks the symmetry, hence every unital artinian ring is noetherian but not by far other way around. 

* [[lab elf|Lab Elf (Swiss department)]]: I _think_ I've fixed the timezone.  I guess the real test is when I submit this page.  Let's see now, it's about 12:50 UTC, so click 'Submit' and ... 12:51 is the reported time.  Yippee!

* [[Andrew Stacey]]: The memory upgrade has happened.  Our IP address has changed so if you can't access the nLab then you need to ... err ...

* [[Urs Schreiber]] made the following keywords all redirect to [[fibration sequence]]: [[cofibration sequence]], [[homotopy fiber]], [[homotopy cofiber]]

  (this is supposed to be in line with what I think is a general strategy we should stick to: that all co-things are discussed in the same entry with things, since otherwise we get huge and unreasonable duplication) 

* [[Zoran Škoda]]: created [[free field (algebra)]], [[perfect field]], [[algebraic group]]. 

* [[lab elf|Lab Elf (children's department)]]: We're getting a memory upgrade sometime soon.  This will involve a downtime of approximately 35-40 minutes (they have to shift our "slice" to another machine to accommodate the upgrade).  I don't know yet exactly when this will occur and I may not get notice in time to post it here (I've requested that it be ASAP).  For obvious reasons, if I do get notice of when it will be then I'll put an announcement on the Forum and somewhere appropriate on the Cafe (I guess the 'nLab migration' thread seems most suitable).

* [[Urs Schreiber]]: expanded [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]]

  * added table of contents to [[cohomology]] and strated adding to related entries

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  In answer to Jon Awbrey\'s question,
   >What day is it?
   it\'s still September 2 UTC, but for some reason the Lab is now on UTC+4, which makes it September 3.  Hopefully we can get it back to UTC, which is the standard for international sites; but if not, then I\'ll probably just edit the 'UTC' up above to 'UTC+4' and leave it at that.

   [[lab elf|Lab Elf (Swiss department)]]: On the TODO list ... Actually, maybe the TODO list ought to be a little more explicit.  I'll stick it on the forum.

* [[Jon Awbrey]] finished formatting [[triadic relation]].

## 2009-09-02

* [[Urs Schreiber]] tried to usefully rearrange the table of contents at [[HowTo]] into subsections a bit, just a suggestion, probably not optimal yet, but I felt the reader might wish to have an easier overview

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  Made a table of contents for [[HowTo]].

* [[Mike Shulman]]: A bit more on displaying MathML at [[HowTo]].

* [[Urs Schreiber]] 

  * expanded the beginning of [[extended topological quantum field theory]], also added further links to existing entries

  * further expanded [[equivariant cohomology]] a bit: made the essential idea a standout box and added group cohomology and local systems as examples.

* [[Rafael Borowiecki]]: 

  * Replied at [[Bousfield localization]].

  * Replied and did some minor changes on [[extended topological quantum field theory]]. I am waiting for the experts to improve what i have written before i write more. 

  * As for the timeline i am glad that it can be fixed but how about the long titles? Ah. the nForum.

* [[Urs Schreiber]]

  * started an entry on [[equivariant cohomology]]

  * I agree with Andrew: single long pages are not so good for the reader. An entry that becomes very long should be split into an overview page with a linked table of contents and sub-pages. We did this for instance for [[gerbe]].

  * added to [[HomePage]] and to [[HowTo]] a note on software prerequisites for displaying MathML. At [[HowTo]] this discussion should eventually be expanded.

  * I changed links throughout the Lab to the pages [[Chevalley-eilenberg algebra in synthetic differential geomet|Chevalley-eilenberg algebra in synthetic differential geometry]] and to [[Verity on descent for strict omega-groupoid valued presheave|Verity on descent for strict omega-groupoid valued presheaves]] to the new truncated title names, so that they will still work. There are more entries for which this is necessary. See the discussion at the forum.

* [[Andrew Stacey]] I've written enough on the Instiki/MediaWiki issues elsewhere and I'm not going to rehash them here (or even link to them).  In short: it ain't gonna happen.  The issues we're having is purely a matter of database differences - it's nothing to do with Instiki itself.  I doubt many people do a database migration - certainly none of the nonsense (abstract or otherwise) that I've read has mentioned the problems we've had - so the issues aren't well known.  I'm finding them out as we go along.  I apologise that it's a live test, but there were only three serious beta testers and they didn't pick up on all of these issues as there were only three of them.

  I don't know why splitting the timeline up wouldn't feel like 2009.  I think that _long_ pages are a hangover from the _old days_.  We should have shorter pages included in to bigger pages (which, incidentally, is what MediaWiki does only it does it without telling you).  "Pages" should be layered so that a visitor gets a broad overview first, then clicks through to get finer and finer details.  One long page seems to miss the point of hyperlinks.

  However, as has been pointed out in elsewhere, this is a lousy place to have a discussion.  These are interesting points to discuss, but distracting on this page, so if anyone would like to pursue them further, I suggest we shift it over to the [forum](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Vanilla/nForum).

  What is more important is to let me know (preferably on the forum) of any other issues with the migrated site.  Now that my eyes have uncrossed, I've realised that I was misreading the MySQL article on storage limits and we _can_ have superlong pages so we will.  Soon.  I promise.

  (I still say it's a bad idea)

* [[Mike Shulman]]

  * Did some editing of [[center]] (added categorifications) and   [[normalizer]], and created [[centralizer]].

  * Tried to remove some of the duplication from [[dualizable object]], [[compact closed category]], and [[rigid monoidal category]], but some is still left.  Perhaps the latter two should really be combined on one page?

* [[Urs Schreiber]]

  * added links back and forth between the new [[extended topological quantum field theory]] and the old [[FQFT]] -- notice that there is a bit of overlap, we may want to rearrange material eventually over these two entries.

  * replied at [[category theory]] (down in the query box at the bottom)

* [[Jon Awbrey]] added a stub and a few links on the subject of [[inquiry]].


## 2009-09-01

* [[Rafael Borowiecki]]: Wrote the beginning of the well deserved page [[extended topological quantum field theory]].

* [[Rafael Borowiecki]]: Just as an interesting fact the new timeline which is not finished is 113kb, then extract the 4 or so long entries that were moved to separate pages and add literature, references and the long discussions. So how are other sites doing it? It looks like it is just nLab that runs into different troubels (even before the migration). I could mention more such as line breaks that is not working smooth or at all, but not now. I can not compare it to many sites but one is wikipedia. Even for editing as Zoran &#352;koda mentioned, wikipedia has no problem in editing parts of a page. I don't know which technology nLab is using (except a part of it is called instiki) but how about an upgrade to such technology as wikipedia is using? In fact everything that i noticed don't work here work in wikipedia. In all, the timeline could be split in two year parts and one main page with discussions, but i don't really like it. Then it would not feel like 2009.

  * [[Mike Shulman]]: Hmm, [deja vu](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Vanilla/nForum/comments.php?DiscussionID=28).

* [[Zoran Škoda]]: Thanks, Andrew a lot for all you are doing. Good night! I am loggin here another concern about terminology abstract nonsense. I am moving much in (predominantly noncommutative and algebraic) geometric
community and my exprience is that when somebody says they proved a fact by abstract nonsense it is NOT confined to categorical methods only but to any CLEAN and GENERAL methods "from the book" as opposed to specific unclean improvizations tailored to a very specific circumstance in question. 

* [[Andrew Stacey]]: My eyes are beginning to cross when reading the MySQL manual.  I may have been misreading a couple of things to do with data storage and it may be possible to get around the timeline problem.  However, I still think that long pages could be better split up.

  I sincerely hope that the lab survives the night, but I'm going offline now so please be patient with it!

* [[Zoran Škoda]]: of course, this is not a solution to the database problem, but I anyway think the discussion part could be separated from the main table of _Timeline_ and the _Timeline_ could have a separate part till 1960 say, then 1960 till 1989 and then third since 1990 (for example, better estimates possible). That would be easier for editing, with big file it is difficult to scroll when editing anyway. I created [[normalizer]], [[center]] (with a word on and redirect [[centralizer]]) and [[holomorph]]. Please check, it is elementary, but it was a quick writing. 

* [[Andrew Stacey]] is seriously considering finding The Doctor and borrowing the Tardis to go back and have a Serious Word with the designers of sqlite3.  (Anyone who gets the reference, I have a great photograph of a bus seen here in Trondheim that proves that The Doctor's greatest enemies are sneakily planning their next invasion from Norway.  But I digress.)  The problem with the timeline is the same as that with the long page names (and with an old problem in the testing stage with stylesheets).  It's down to a fundamental difference in design between sqlite3 (the old, slow database backend) and mysql (the newer, snappier model).  Basically, while both allow you to declare certain entries to be a certain type, sqlite3 then proceeds to __ignore that type__.  Mysql (and just about every other database) enforces it.  So when Instiki says "page names should be at most 60 chars long", Mysql truncates them to 60 chars while sqlite3 merrily accepts page names as long as Lanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch and back again.  Twice.  Similarly, where MySQL has a limit on lengths of rows in its database (happens to be 65535 bytes), sqlite3 merrily goes on accepting data as long as it gets it.

  You can see where this is going, can't you.  Yup, timeline hit that latter limit.  It's currently over 80000 _characters_, and some of those are unicode so I've no idea how many actual bytes it is!

  Before anyone suggests going back to sqlite3, let me point out that we can't scale up with sqlite3.  So that's a non-starter.  There are complicated possibilities in which we have more than one row for a page, but the absolute simplest would be to split long pages into smaller ones and then include them from the main one.  So we could split the timeline into, say, decades and then an extra bit for the discussion and simply include them all on the main timeline page.  That would also make editing the page a bit slicker and quicker.

  If that is acceptable, then I can load up the timeline in two segments for someone to carve up into more sensible pieces.  It'll be tomorrow now before I get round to doing this (sorry).

  I'll also have to figure out whether any more pages are affected by this.  I'm afraid that I'll have to roll these back to how they were when the lab was migrated (but presumably no-one's actually tried to edit one of these truncated pages, otherwise there'd've been more bugs noted here).

* [[Todd Trimble]] added a teeny bit to [[locally convex topological vector space]]. I hope to be more in nLab editor mode soon. Congratulations on a successful migration (with big thanks to [[Andrew Stacey]]). 

  [[Andrew Stacey]]: I'd hold off on the champagne for a little bit ...

* [[Zoran Škoda]]: query in [[category theory]]: I think that blaming the terminology *abstract nonsense* to predominantly non-likers is misleading and that the wikipedia is this time more correct than nlab. 

  * [[Jon Awbrey]]: I have always understood the term "abstract nonsense" as a pun on the sense of the word "sense" that means "direction" --- hence "abstract nonsense" suggests something like the "formal path-independence" of commutative diagrams.  I'm sure I mentioned this to several people back in the day, and they all said something like, "well, duh."

  * [[Zoran Škoda]]: I never heard of such interpretation; plus this interpretation would not survive in other languages like Russian and French where the direction and sense/nonsense do not mix like that. Russian version of *abstract nonsense* is &#1072;&#1073;&#1089;&#1090;&#1088;&#1072;&#1082;&#1090;&#1085;&#1072;&#1103; &#1095;&#1077;&#1087;&#1091;&#1093;&#1072;. 

* [[Jon Awbrey]] added stubs and links at [[sign relation]] and [[triadic relation]].

* [[Urs Schreiber]]: replied in the discussion at the bottom of [[category theory]] -- and have a question

  * [[Todd Trimble]] chucked in two cents here. 

* [[Urs Schreiber]]  WATCH OUT WITH LONG ENTRY NAMES -- see the $n$forum discussion. Some long entry names got truncated in the migration. the entry "Chevalley-eilenberg algebra in synthetic differential geometry" for instance is now called [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra in synthetic differential geomet]]

 See "all pages" to find out the truncated entry name of an entry that you know should be there but is missing. 

* [[Rafael Borowiecki]]: To [[Andrew Stacey]]. The whole bottom part of the page [[Timeline of category theory and related mathematics]] is abruptly missing. Which is a lot, not only my question. Since i have the full version loaded in a browser i could try to reconstruct it but i would prefer if you did a rollback if you can.

* [[Jon Awbrey]] added content to [[hypostatic abstraction]].

* [[John Baez]]: 

  * answered Rafael's plea for a definition of 'CW complex' in that big discussion on [[category theory]], and also commented on Urs' remark about 'simplicial complexes';

  * completed the definition of [[monoidal category]] by adding the triangle equation;
  
  * added some remarks on right vs. left duals on [[rigid monoidal category]];

  * noted that the $n$Lab crashed a couple of times while I was doing this.  Unfortunately I did not get a screenshot of the fancy error message.

    [[Andrew Stacey]]: Yes, we hit our memory ceiling a couple of times.  I've lowered a couple of settings to try to ensure that we don't do this again but it's a bit experimental as to what the best settings are.  It's all a bit of a learning experience for me!  (Perhaps I shouldn't admit to that ...)

* [[Zoran Škoda]]: I restarted the system and now IE renders [[normal subgroup]] correctly. This is strange as it had problems only with new entries [[normal subgroup]] and [[normal closure]] (even after many reloads) and rendered correctly the other entries. Now after reboot even they appear correct. 

  [[Andrew Stacey]]: Okay, sounds like it was a cache bug.  During the changeover, various addresses pointed all over the shop and there are redirects going all ways from Sunday, so it's not surprising that a browser get confused.  Clearing caches is probably a good idea.  It will take a while before ncatlab.org properly points here for everyone (for example, from my work machine it was working from about midday; now at home then it still resolves to the old lab).  But if you type 'ncatlab.org' into a browser you will always end up _here_, it just might be via a slightly circuitous route.

* [[Zoran Škoda]]: I just created [[normal subgroup]], [[normal closure]], but they do not render correctly on my IE. Is this a new-system glitch? The letters and formulas are one across another. Did not make last night logging that I added a paragraph or so on the Jacobi matrix and the application (Alexander polynomial) into the [[Fox derivative]]. I also created [[derived affine scheme]] in the sense of Toen et al. 

  [[Andrew Stacey]]: No idea!  Can you send me a screen shot?  Unfortunately, the Windows machine that I have control over can't connect to the wireless network here (Oh, the irony!) and the windows machine that I don't have control over doesn't have MathML support.

* [[Andrew Stacey]]: The migrating eagle has landed.

  There will inevitably be hiccoughs, hangups, and hassles.  Please log them over at the [nForum](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Vanilla/nForum).  Also, if you notice weird behaviour then there may be an explanation of it over there (just because I know what causes it doesn't mean I've implemented the fix yet).

* [[Urs Schreiber]]

  * replied at [[Bousfield localization]]

* [[Jon Awbrey]]:

  * "A [[continuous predicate]], as described by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], is a special type of relational predicate that arises as the limit of an iterated process of [[hypostatic abstraction]]."

*  [[Rafael Borowiecki]]:
  * Posed a question at [[Timeline of category theory and related mathematics]] regarding a new migration: How do i handle to update most of 1500 links!?
    * [[Andrew Stacey]]: I've looked for your question and can't find it.  I apologise if it's been lost in the migration, but can you ask it again?  If it's technical, the forum might be a better place to ask it.
  * Suggested that manifold objects should be treated or at least mentioned at [[manifold]].
  * Provided references for my question at [[Bousfield localization]].
  * Split the subsection what is category theory at [[category theory]] into two parts: In the narrow sense and In the wide sense. This makes sense.
  * Added briefly how toposes and higher categories come into category theory as a foundations at [[category theory]].
  * Added what it means for category theory to be a unifying tool and language in mathematics at [[category theory]].
  * Replied to the discussion at [[category theory]].

   I see the migration went well, at least so far. :)

   ([[Andrew Stacey]]: actually, it happened _after_ you posted this, but thanks all the same!

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  Happy September!!!

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  Now, you know it\'s not September for another half hour, right?  (^_^)

   * [[Urs Schreiber]]: oops, you are right, I forgot that I am not exactly at GMT +0. 

* [[Urs Schreiber]]

  * moved the accumulated latest changes of last month to [[2009 August changes]] (by renaming the last "latest changes" and then creating a new one)
