## Idea 

The notion of **$sSet$-site** is the incarnation of the notion of [[(∞,1)-site]] when [[(∞,1)-categories]] are incarnated as [[simplicially enriched categories]].

## Definition

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

An **$sSet$-site** is a [[simplicially enriched category]] $C$ together with the structure of a [[site]] on its [[homotopy category of an (infinity,1)-category|homotopy category]] $Ho(C)$.

=--

This appears as ([To&#235;nVezzosi, def. 3.1.1](#ToenVezzosi))


## Properties

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Proposition

Under the identification of [[simplicially enriched categories]] with models for [[(∞,1)-categories]], $sSet$-sites correspond to [[(∞,1)-site]]s.

=--

Because as discussed at [[(∞,1)-site]], that is equivalently an [[(∞,1)-category]] equipped with the structure of a site on its [[homotopy category of an (∞,1)-category]].
