## Idea 

An [[(∞,1)-category]] equipped with the structure of a [[site]] on its [[homotopy category of an (∞,1)-category|homotopy category]] serves as a domain for [[∞-stack]]s. It may be modeled by a [[simplicially enriched category]].

A [[simplicially enriched category]] with the structure of a [[site]] is called an **$SSet$-site** ([def 3.1.1](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/math/pdf/0207/0207028v4.pdf#page=18) in [ToVeI](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0404373)).
