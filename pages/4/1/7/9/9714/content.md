## Idea

The concept of _$(2,1)$-functors_ is that of the natural kind of [[morphisms]] between [[(2,1)-categories]].

If [[(2,1)-categories]] are regarded as special cases of [[2-categories]], then $(2,1)$-functors are equivalently the [[2-functors]] between [[(2,1)-categories]].

If [[(2,1)-categories]] are regarded as special cases of [[(∞,1)-categories]], then $(2,1)$-functors are equivalently the [[(∞,1)-functors]] between [[(2,1)-categories]].

## Examples

* The construction of [[groupoid convolution algebras]] constitutes a $(2,1)$-functor from [[differentiable stacks]] with proper maps between them and the [[opposite 2-category|opposite]] $(2,1)$-category of [[C*-algebras]] with [[Hilbert bimodules]] between them. For details see [there](#category+algebra#GroupoidConvolutionIs2Functor).
