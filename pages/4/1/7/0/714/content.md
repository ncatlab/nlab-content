# $\dagger$ categories

## Idea

The definition of a [[category]] effectively enforces an ordering on the "0-faces" -- the source and target [[object]]s -- of every 1-cell (every [[morphism]]). In many cases this is essential, in that there is no way to regard the generic morphism $a \stackrel{f}{\to} b$ in the category as a morphism from $b$ to $a$ instead.

But there are many categories for which this is not the case, where every morphism naturally only comes with the information of an unordered pair $\{a,b \}$ of objects, without any prejudice on which is to be regarded as source and which as target. An important general example is:

* the category $Spans(C)$ of [[span|spans]] in a category $C$ with pullbacks, or [[duality|dually]], the category $CoSpans(C)$ of [[cospan|cospans]] in a category $C$ with pushouts.

More concrete examples are:

* categories of [[cobordism]]s (but notice that cobordisms are naturally regarded as [[cospan]]s which makes this a special case of the above example);

* the category [[Hilb]] of Hilbert spaces, where for every linear map $f : H_1 \to H_2$ we also have the adjoint map (in the sense of Hilbert spaces, not in the categorical sense) $f^\dagger : H_2 \to H_1$ (but notice that according to [[groupoidification]] this is also essentially to be regarded as a special case of categories of spans).

A _dagger structure_ on a category is extra structure which encodes the idea of _removing_ the ordering information on the 0-faces of 1-cells in a category: it is a contravariant functor which sends every morphism $f : a \to b$ to a morphism going the other way, $f^\dagger : b \to a$.

The notation and terminology here is motivated from the example [[Hilb]] of Hilbert spaces, where $f^\dagger$ is traditionally the notion for the adjoint of a linear map $f$.  The canonical &#8224;-structure on [[Hilb]] and on [[nCob]] is crucial in [[FQFT|quantum field theory]] where it is used to encode the idea of **unitarity**:

a _unitary_ [[FQFT|functorial QFT]] of dimension $n$ is supposed to be a functor $n Cob \to Hilb$ which respects the &#8224;-structure on both sides.


## Terminology

In Wikipedia a [dagger category](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagger_category) is said to be the same as _involutive category_ or _category with involution_.  However, [Springer's Encyclopedia of Mathematics](https://encyclopediaofmath.org/wiki/Category_with_involution) requires that a "category with involution" is also compatibly [[enriched category|enriched]] over [[posets]].

In enriched category theory, involutive categories have also been called **symmetric categories**. Sometimes the involution is required to be strict in the sense that the dagger is an *equality* rather than an *isomorphism*: in line with [[horizontal categorification]], one could argue these should be called **commutative categories**, since a one-object category with such an involution is a [[commutative monoid]].

## Definition

### Dagger categories

#### With a family of functions

\begin{definition}
A **dagger category** or $\dagger$-category $C$ is a [[category]] with a function $(-)^\dagger: Hom_C(A,B) \to hom_C(B,A)$ for every object $A,B \in Ob(C)$, such that 

* for every $A \in Ob(C)$, $(1_A)^\dagger = 1_A$,
* for every $A,B \in Ob(C)$ and every $f \in Hom_C(A,B)$ and $g \in Hom_C(B,C)$, $(g \circ f)^\dagger = f^\dagger \circ g^\dagger$,
* and for every $A,B \in Ob(C)$ and every $f \in Hom_C(A,B)$, $((f)^\dagger)^\dagger = f$. 

\end{definition}

#### With a function

\begin{definition}
Given a category $C$ with a type or class of objects $Ob(C)$ and a set of morphisms $Mor(C)$ with source and target functions $s:Mor(C) \to Ob(C)$ and $t:Mor(C) \to Ob(C)$, $C$ is a **dagger category** if it has a function $(-)^\dagger:Mor(C) \to Mor(C)$ such that 

* for every term $f:Mor(C)$, $s(f) = t(f^\dagger)$
* for every term $f:Mor(C)$, $t(f) = s(f^\dagger)$
* for every term $f:Mor(C)$, $(f^\dagger)^\dagger = f$
* for every term $a:Ob(C)$, $id(a)^\dagger = id(a)$
* for every term $f:Mor(C)$ and $g:Mor(C)$ such that $t(f) =_D s(g)$, $(g \circ f)^\dagger = f^\dagger \circ g^\dagger$. 

\end{definition}

#### With a functor 

\begin{definition}
A **dagger category** is a [[category]] $C$ equipped with a [[contravariant functor|contravariant endofunctor]], hence an ordinary [[functor]] from the [[opposite category]] $C^{op}$ of $C$ to $C$ itself

$$
  \dagger : C^{op} \to C
$$

which 

1. is the [[identity-on-objects]], 

1. is an [[involution]] $\dagger^{op} \circ \dagger = \mathrm{id}_C$.

\end{definition}

This definition, which is perhaps the most concise, does rely on a notion of [[identity-on-objects functor]].  This is no problem in most foundations for mathematics, although it violates the [[principle of equivalence]] (except for [[strict categories]]).  In [[homotopy type theory]] (or more generally [[intensional type theory]]) it doesn't make sense to talk about "being the identity on objects" as a property of a given functor, but one can still define an "identity-on-objects endofunctor" (covariant or contravariant) as a basic notion; see [[identity-on-objects functor]] for details.  When unwound for $\dagger$-categories, this yields the above "family of functions" definition.

### Special morphisms

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

A morphism $f$ in a &#8224;-category is called a **[[unitary morphism]]** if its &#8224;-adjoint equals its [[inverse]]:

$$
  f^\dagger = f^{-1}
  \,.
$$

=--


For the purpose of considering what makes two objects of a $\dagger$-category [[equivalence|equivalent]], one should not consider all [[isomorphism]]s (invertible morphisms) but rather all unitary isomorphisms.

The unitary isomorphisms form a [[groupoid]], which may be regarded as the _dagger-[[core]]_ of the $\dagger$-category.


For example, in [[Hilb]], there are many invertible linear operators, but only those of norm $1$ (the invertible isometries) are unitary.

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

A morphism $f$ in a &#8224;-category is called a **[[self-adjoint morphism]]** if it equals its &#8224;-adjoint

$$
  f^\dagger = f
  \,.
$$

 

=--


### The category of &#8224;-categories {#CatOfDagCats}

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition
Given two $\dagger$-categories $A$ and $B$, a [[dagger functor|$\dagger$-functor]] $F : A \to B$ consists of a function $F_0 : Ob(A) \to Ob(B)$ with a function $F_{a,b}:Hom_A(a,b) \to Hom_B(F a,F b)$ for every object $a,b:Ob(A)$, where $F_{a,b}$ is generally also denoted as $F$, such that

* for every object $a \in Ob(A)$, $F(1_a)=1_{F a}$, 
* for every object $a,b,c \in Ob(A)$ and morphisms $f \in Hom_A(a,b)$ and $g \in Hom_A(b,c)$, $F(g \circ_A f) = F g \circ_B F f$
* for every object $a,b \in Ob(A)$ and morphism $f \in Hom_A(a,b)$, $F(f^{\dagger_A}) = (F f)^{\dagger_B}$. 
=--

More concisely, one can say that a $\dagger$-functor $(A,\dagger) \to (B,\ddagger)$ is a [[functor]] $F : A \to B$ of the underlying categories that commutes with the $\dagger$-structures in that $F \circ \dagger = \ddagger \circ F^{op}$.  This appears to violate the [[principle of equivalence]], since it is a strict equality of functors; however, once $\dagger$ and $\ddagger$ are known to be the identity on objects (whatever that means), the two functors $F\circ \dagger$ and $\ddagger \circ F^{op}$ automatically agree on objects.

A [[natural transformation]] between $\dagger$-functors is just a natural transformation of the underlying functors. 

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

The &#8224;-adjoint $\eta^*$ of a natural transformation 

$$
  \eta : F \to G 
$$

between two &#8224;-functors $F, G : (C,\dagger) \to (D,\ddagger)$ is given by the componentwise $\ddagger$-adjoint:

$$
  (\eta^*)_a := (\eta_a)^\ddagger
  \,.
$$

=--

To check that $\eta^*$ is indeed a natural transformation $\eta^* : G \to F$
consider $f : a \to b$ any morphism in $C$ and $f^\dagger : b \to a$ its $\dagger$-adjoint and let 

$$
  \array{
    F(a) &\stackrel{\eta_a}{\to}& G(a)
    \\
    \uparrow^{\mathrlap{F(f^\dagger)}} && \uparrow^{\mathrlap{G(f^\dagger)}}
    \\
    F(b) &\stackrel{\eta_b}{\to}& G(b)
  }
$$

be the corresponding naturality square of $\eta$. Taking the $\ddagger$-adjoint of the entire diagram yields

$$
  \array{
    F(a) &\stackrel{\eta_a^\ddagger}{\leftarrow}& G(a)
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{F(f^\dagger)^{\ddagger}}} 
    && 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{G(f^\dagger)^{\ddagger}}}
    \\
    F(b) &\stackrel{\eta_b^{\ddagger}}{\leftarrow}& G(b)
  }
  \;\;\;
  =
  \;\;\;
  \array{
    F(a) &\stackrel{\eta_a^\ddagger}{\leftarrow}& G(a)
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{F(f)}} 
    && 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{G(f)}}
    \\
    F(b) &\stackrel{\eta_b^{\ddagger}}{\leftarrow}& G(b)
  }
$$

by the fact that $F$ and $G$ are &#8224;-functors. This is the naturality square over $f$ of $\eta^* : G \to F$.


+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

Write $DagCat$ for the [[category]] whose objects are &#8224;-categories and whose morphisms are &#8224;-functors.

For $(C,\dagger)$ and $(D,\dagger)$ two &#8224;-categories, write 
$([(C,\dagger),(D,\ddagger)]_{dag}, \star) \in DagCat$ for the &#8224;-category whose objects are &#8224;-functors, whose morphisms are natural transformations, with the &#8224;-operation $\star : \eta \mapsto \eta^*$ as above.

=--

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

The assignment $((C,\dagger),(D,\ddagger)) \mapsto [(C,\dagger),(D,\ddagger)]_{dag}, \star)$ extends to an [[internal hom]]-functor

$$
  [-,-] : DagCat^{op} \times DagCat \to DagCat
$$

that makes $DagCat$ into a [[cartesian closed category]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

This follows step-by-step the standard proof that [[Cat]] is cartesian closed, while observing that each step respects the respect for &#8224;-structures.

To indicate the main point, let $C, D$ and $E$ be &#8224;-categories and consider a functor $F : C \times D \to E$. For $(f : c_1 \to c_2) \in C$ and $(g : d_1 \to d_2) \in D$ we have natural assignments

$$
  \array{
    (c_1, d_1) &\stackrel{(Id,g)}{\to}& (c_1, d_2)  
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(f,Id)}} &\searrow^{(f,g)}& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(f,Id)}}
    \\
    (c_2, d_1)
    &\stackrel{(Id,g)}{\to}&
    (c_2, d_2)
  }
  \;\;\;\;\;
  \mapsto
  \;\;\;\;\;
  \array{
    F(c_1, d_1) &\stackrel{F(Id,g)}{\to}& F(c_1, d_2)  
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{F(f,Id)}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{F(f,Id)}}
    \\
    F(c_2, d_1)
    &\stackrel{F(Id,g)}{\to}&
    f(c_2, d_2)
  }
$$ 

that respect daggering all morphisms, in the evident way.

Keeping $d_1$ and $d_2$ fixed, respectively this makes $F(-,d_1), F(-,d_2) : C \to E$ &#8224;-functors. We see from the diagrams that $F(-,(d_1 \stackrel{g}{\to}) d_2)$ is a natural transformation between these &#8224;-functors, and the fact that $F$ intertwines the dagger operation of $D$ with that of $E$ means $F$ regarded as a functor $D \to [C,E]$ intertwines the &#8224;-structures of $D$ and $[D,E]_{dag}$, by the above definition.

=--

## Examples

* The category [[Rel]] of sets and [[relations]] is a &#8224;-category, taking dagger as relational converse.

* More generally, let $C$ be a category with [[pullbacks]] and let $Span_1(C)$ be the 1-category of [[spans]] up to isomorphism: its morphisms are spans with one leg labeled as source, the other labeled as target. Then the functor $\dagger : Span_1(C)^{op} \to Span_1(C)$ which just exchanges this labeling is a &#8224;-structure on $Span_1(C)$.

* $\mathcal{R}(G)$, the category of unitary [[representation]]s of a (discrete) [[group]] $G$ and intertwining maps, is a &#8224;-category. For an intertwiner $\phi : R \rightarrow S$, let $\phi^\dagger : S \rightarrow R$ be the adjoint of $\phi$ in [[Hilb]].

* Every [[symmetric proset]] is a [[thin category|thin]] &#8224;-category. 

## Variants

* [[strict dagger category]]

* [[univalent dagger category]]

### Monoidal &#8224;-categories

* [[monoidal dagger category]]

  * [[braided monoidal dagger category]]

  * [[symmetric monoidal dagger category]]

  * [[compact closed dagger category]]

  * [[cartesian monoidal dagger category]]

  * [[cocartesian monoidal dagger category]]

  * [[semiadditive dagger category]]

### $\dagger$-2-posets

A [[dagger 2-poset|$\dagger$-2-poset]] is a $\dagger$-category that is also a [[2-poset]]. Examples of $\dagger$-2-posets include [[allegories]] and [[bicategories of relations]]. 

### Model structure on &#8224;-categories {#ModelStructure}

> the following is based on a remark by [[Andre Joyal]], [posted](https://github.com/punkdit/categories/blob/master/gmane/science/mathematics/categories/5477) to the CategoryTheory mailing list on Jan 5, 2010, with a [follow-up](https://github.com/punkdit/categories/blob/master/gmane/science/mathematics/categories/5487) on Jan 6.

Consider &#8224;-categories from the point of view of [[homotopy theory]].

Recall that the category [[Cat]] of [[small category|small categories]] naturally admits the [[model category]] structure called the [[folk model structure on Cat]].

The category of small &#8224;-categories $DCat$ also admits
a "natural" [[model category]] structure: 

* &#8224;-functor $f:A \to B$ is a weak equivalence iff it is 

  * [[full and faithful functor|full and faithful]];

  * and unitary surjective, meaning that every object of $B$ is unitary isomorphic to an object in the image of the functor $f$;

* the cofibrations and the trivial fibrations are as in [[folk model structure on Cat|Cat]];

* fibrations are the unitary isofibration: maps having the [[right lifting property]] for unitary isomorphisms.

The [[forgetful functor]] $DCat \to Cat$ is a [[right adjoint]]
but it is not a [[Quillen adjunction|right Quillen functor]] with respect to the natural model structures on these categories.

Moreover, a forgetful functor $XStruc \to Cat$ should reflect
weak equivalences in addition to preserving them.
The forgetful functor $DCat\to Cat$ preserves weak equivalences
but it does not reflect them. Because two objects in a &#8224;-category can be isomorphic without been unitary isomorphic.

In other words the forgetful functor $DCat\to Cat$ is wrong.
This may explains why a &#8224;-category cannot be
regarded as a category equipped a homotopy invariant structure, as discussed in more detail in the example sections of the entry _[[principle of equivalence]]_.


But the notion of &#8224;-category is perfectly reasonable
from an homotopy theoretic point of view. This is because the model category $DCat$ is a [[combinatorial model category]].
It follows, by a general result, that the notion of &#8224;-category is homotopy essentially algebraic.
There is a homotopy limit sketch whose category of models (in spaces) is [[Quillen equivalence|Quillen equivalent]] to the model category $DCat$. This is true also for the model category Cat.

### $\dagger$-simplicial set

> the following is based on a remark by [[Andre Joyal]], posted to the CategoryTheory mailing list on Jan 6, 2010

A &#8224;-[[simplicial set]] can be defined to be a simplicial set $X$ equipped with an involutive [[isomorphism]] $\dagger :X\to X^{op}$ which is the identity on 0-cells.
The category of &#8224;-simplicial sets (and dagger preserving maps)
is the category of [[presheaf|presheaves]] on the category whose objects are the ordinals $[n]$, but where the maps $[m]\to [n]$ are order reversing or preserving.

#### $\dagger$-Graphs

* [[dagger-graph]]

###  $(\infty,1)$-&#8224;-categories {##oo1Version}


> the following is based on a remark by [[Andre Joyal]], posted to the CategoryTheory mailing list on Jan 6, 2010


There should be a notion of &#8224;-[[quasi-category]] based on $\dagger$-simplicial sets as ordinary quasi-categories are based on ordinary simplicial sets.

(...)

## Properties

### Relation to anti-involutive monoids

The [[horizontal categorification]] of an [[anti-involution|anti-involutive]] [[monoid]] is a $\dagger$-category

### Relation to symmetric prosets

Every [[symmetric proset]] is a [[thin category|thin]] $\dagger$-category, and the [[groupoidal categorification]] of a symmetric proset is a $\dagger$-category, with the $\dagger$ operation being the groupoidal categorification of the symmetric property. 

### Relation to star-algebras

The [[category convolution algebra]] of a dagger category is naturally a [[star-algebra]]. The star-involution is given by [[pullback of functions]] along the $\dagger$-functor.


## Applications


### Quantum mechanics in terms of $\dagger$-compact categories

The [[finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces]] of interest in [[quantum information theory]] and [[quantum computation]] form $\dagger$-categories that are 
also [[compact closed categories]] ([[dagger compact categories]]), a fact that allow a [[string diagram]]-calculus for [[quantum mechanics in terms of †-compact categories]] which motivates much of the contemporary discussion of dagger-categories, starting with [Abramsky & Coecke 2004](#AbramskyCoecke04).
