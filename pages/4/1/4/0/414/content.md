An [[object]] $P$ of a [[category]] $C$ is **projective** (with respect to epimorphisms) if for any [[morphism]] $f:P \to B$ and any [[epimorphism]] $q:A \to B$, $f$ factors through $q$ by some morphism $P\to A$.

If $C$ has [[pullback|pullbacks]] and epimorphisms are preserved by pullback, as is the case in a [[pretopos]], this is equivalent to saying that any epimorphism $Q\to P$ is [[split epimorphism|split]].

A category $C$ has **enough projectives** if for every object $X$ there is an epimorphism $P\to X$ where  $P$ is projective.

There are variations of this definition where "epimorphism" is replaced by some other type of morphism, such as a [[strong epimorphism]] or the left class in some [[orthogonal factorization system]].
