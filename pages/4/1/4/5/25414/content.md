## Idea

The terms 'geometric $n$-category' or 'geometrical $n$-category' broadly refer to notions of [[higher categories]] whose [[composition]] [[operation]] is modelled on the [[stratified space|stratified-geometric]] notion of [[manifold diagram|manifold diagrams]]. 

## Examples

* [[geometric computad|Geometric computads]] are [[free object|free]] instances of geometric $n$-categories.

* [[associative n-category|Associative $n$-categories]] are instances of geometric $n$-categories (and, in fact, their combinatorics precedes some of the stratified-geometric ideas of geometric $n$-categories). 'Free' associative $n$-categories are instances of [[geometric computad|geometric computads]]. The relation of manifold-diagrammatic composition with (higher) associativity derives from the observation that geometric gluings do not remember the order in which they occur.

## Remarks

While in some instances (such as the 'free' case of [[geometric computad|geometric computads]]) definitions of geometric $n$-categories have been given, the theory of geometric higher categories overall remains under-developed.
