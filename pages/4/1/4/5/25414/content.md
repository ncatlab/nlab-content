## Idea

The notion of 'manifold-diagrammatic higher categories' (in some [places](#geocats) also referred to as a 'geometric' or 'geometrical' higher categories) broadly refers to [[higher categories]] whose [[composition]] [[operation]] is modelled on the [[stratified space|stratified-geometric]] notion of [[manifold diagram|manifold diagrams]]. 

## Examples

* [[geometric computad|Geometric computads]] are [[free object|free]] instances of manifold-diagrammatic $n$-categories.

* [[associative n-category|Associative $n$-categories]] are instances of manifold diagrammatic $n$-categories (and, in fact, their combinatorics precedes some of the stratified-geometric ideas of manifold-diagrammatic $n$-categories). The relation of manifold-diagrammatic composition with (higher) associativity derives from the observation that geometric gluings do not remember the order in which they occur.

## Remarks

* {#coherence_paradigm} [[coherence law|Coherences]] in manifold-diagrammatic categories derive from isotopies of manifold strata. This provides a different mechanism for coherence construction than the mechanism found in many existing, spatially-inspired models of [[higher categories]] (which create coherences by enforcing contractibility of 'spaces of composites'). The conceptual difference between the two mechanisms is discussed in more detail in this [blog post](https://cxdorn.github.io/research/paradigms-of-higher-cats/).

* {#geocats} Manifold-diagrammatic categories have also been referred to 'geometric higher categories' or 'geometrical higher categories', based on a distinction of 'geometric', 'topological' and 'combinatorial' models of higher structures as explained [here](https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2023/03/an_invitation_to_geometric_hig.html). See also [here](https://nforum.ncatlab.org/discussion/16159/geometric-ncategory/#Item_10) for a relevant discussion about terminology.

* While in some instances (such as the 'free' case of [[geometric computad|geometric computads]]) definitions of manifold-diagrammatic $n$-categories have been given, the theory of manifold diagrammatic higher categories overall remains under-developed.
