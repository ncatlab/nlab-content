## Definition

A __weak model category__ is a [[premodel category]] that satisfies the following two axioms.

__Cylinder axiom__: Every [[cofibration]] $A\to X$ from a [[cofibrant object]]
to a [[fibrant object]] admits a __relative strong cylinder object__
$$X\sqcup_A X\to I_A X\to X,$$
where the left map is a [[cofibration]] and its first component $X\to I_A X$
is an [[acyclic cofibration]].

__Path object axiom__: Every [[fibration]] $A\to X$ from a [[cofibrant object]]
to a [[fibrant object]] admits a __relative strong path object__
$$A\to P_X A\to A\times_X A,$$
where the right map is a [[fibration]] and its first component $P_X A\to A$
is an [[acyclic fibration]].
