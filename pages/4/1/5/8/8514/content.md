## Idea

The _abc conjecture_ (written also _ABC conjecture_ and also known as the _Masser-Oesterl&#233; conjecture_) is a [[number theory|number theoretic]] conjecture posed by Joseph Oesterl&#233; and David Masser in 1985. They looked at triples $a,b,c$ of [[relatively prime integers]] satisfying the [[equation]] $a+b+c = 0$ (or nowdays often instead $a + b = c$). They stratify the solution according to their "power". 

By the [[radical]] $rad(N)$ of an [[integer]] $N$ one means the product of all its distinct [[prime factors]]. The _power_ of an abc-solution $(a,b,c)$ one denotes $P(a,b,c) = log|c|/log(rad(a\cdot b\cdot c))$. The statement then is:

__abc conjecture__ _For any number $\epsilon\gt 0$ there are only finitely many integer solutions $(a,b,c)$ to the abc equation with power $P(a,b,c)\geq\epsilon$._

According to ([Mazur](#Matzur)):

> The beauty of such a Conjecture is that it captures the intuitive sense that triples of numbers which satisfy a linear relation, and which are divisible by high perfect powers, are rare; the precision of the Conjecture goads one to investigate this rarity quantitatively. Its very statement makes an attractive appeal to perform a range of numerical experiments that would test the empirical waters. On a theoretical level, it is enlightening to understand its relationship to the constellation of standard arithmetic theorems, conjectures, questions, etc., and we shall give some indications of this below.
