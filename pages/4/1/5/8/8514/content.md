## Idea

The _abc conjecture_ (or _ABC conjecture_) is a [[number theory|number theoretic]] conjecture due to ([Oesterl&#233;-Masser 1985](#Oesterl&#233;Masser)), which says that there are only [[finite set|finitely many]] solutions to the simple [[equation]] 

$$
  a + b = c   \;\;\; for a,b,c \geq 1 \in \mathbb{N}
$$

if one requires the [[natural numbers]] $a,b,c$ to have no common factor as well as having "joint power" greater than a given bound.

Here the _power_ of $a,b,c$ is

$$
  P(a,b,c) \coloneqq \frac{log|c|}{log(rad(a\cdot b\cdot c))}
  \,,
$$

where the [[radical]] $rad(n)$ of an [[integer]] $n$ is the product of all its distinct [[prime factors]]. 

The precise form of the conjecture is:

###### Conjecture
**(abc conjecture)**

For any number $\epsilon\gt 0$ there are only finitely many positive [[coprime integers|coprime]] [[integer]] solutions $(a,b,c)$ to the [[equation]] $a + b = c$   with power $P(a,b,c)\geq 1+\epsilon$.

According to ([Mazur](#Matzur)):

> The beauty of such a Conjecture is that it captures the intuitive sense that triples of numbers which satisfy a linear relation, and which are divisible by high perfect powers, are rare; the precision of the Conjecture goads one to investigate this rarity quantitatively. Its very statement makes an attractive appeal to perform a range of numerical experiments that would test the empirical waters. On a theoretical level, it is enlightening to understand its relationship to the constellation of standard arithmetic theorems, conjectures, questions, etc., and we shall give some indications of this below.

## Relation to other statements

The abc conjecture implies the [[Mordell conjecture]] ([Elkies](#Elkies)).

It is equivalent to the general form of [[Szpiro's conjecture]].
