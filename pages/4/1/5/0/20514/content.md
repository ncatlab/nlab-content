### Possible tension of model with observation
 {#H0TensionReferences}

Possible tensions in the [[standard model of cosmology]], regarding determination of the [[Hubble constant]] in the early and late universe, apparently observed by various groups, since the late 2010s:

review:

* L. Verde T. Treu, A.G. Riess, _Tensions between the Early and the Late Universe_ ([arXiv:1907.10625](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10625))

Indication that the tension is not in the data but in systematic errors:

Indication that the tension is not resolved by effects in [[inhomogeneous cosmology]] (such as the [[KBC void]]):
