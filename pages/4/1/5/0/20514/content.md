### Possible tension of model with observation
 {#H0TensionReferences}

Possible tensions in the [[standard model of cosmology]], regarding determination of the [[Hubble constant]] in the early and late universe, apparently observed by various groups, since the late 2010s:

review:

* L. Verde T. Treu, A.G. Riess, _Tensions between the Early and the Late Universe_ ([arXiv:1907.10625](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10625))

Indication that the tension is not in the data but in systematic errors:

* Freedman et al. _The Carnegie-Chicago Hubble Program. VIII. An Independent Determination of the Hubble Constant Based on the Tip of the Red Giant Branch_ ([arxiv:1907.05922](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05922))

Indication that the tension is not in systematic errors:

* [[Adam Riess]], Gagandeep Anand, Wenlong Yuan, Stefano Casertano, Andrew Dolphin, Lucas Macri, Louise Breuval, Dan Scolnic, Marshall Perrin, Richard Anderson, *Crowded No More: The Accuracy of the Hubble Constant Tested\\with High Resolution Observations of Cepheids by JWST* ([arXiv:2307.15806](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15806))

Indication from new data from the [[James Webb Space Telescope]] that the old data does not have systematic errors and the tension is in the data:

* [[Wenlong Yuan]], [[Adam G. Riess]], [[Stefano Casertano]], [[Lucas M. Macri]], *A First Look at Cepheids in a SN Ia Host with JWST* ([arXiv:2209.09101](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09101))

Indication that the tension is not resolved by effects in [[inhomogeneous cosmology]] (such as the [[KBC void]]):

* Hao-Yi Wu, Dragan Huterer, _Sample variance in the local measurements of the Hubble constant_, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Volume 471, Issue 4, November 2017, Pages 4946–4955 ([arXiv:1706.09723](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.09723))

Indications that the Hubble constant is decreasing over time:

* Xuan-Dong Jia, Jian-Ping Hu, Fa-Yin Wang, *The evidence for a decreasing trend of Hubble constant*, ([arXiv:2212.00238](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00238))

On the status of the Hubble tension as of 25 January 2023

* Maria Dainotti, Biagio De Simone, Giovanni Montani, Tiziano Schiavone, Gaetano Lambiase, *The Hubble constant tension: current status and future perspectives through new cosmological probes* ([arXiv:2301.10572](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10572))

On the local value of the Hubble constant:

* [[Adam G. Riess]],  Louise Breuval, *The Local Value of $H_0$* ([arXiv:2308.10954](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10954))

On the status of various alternatives to the [[standard model of cosmology]] to resolve the Hubble tension:

* Ali Rida Khalife, Maryam Bahrami Zanjani, Silvia Galli, Sven Günther, Julien Lesgourgues, Karim Benabed, *Review of Hubble tension solutions with new SH0ES and SPT-3G data* ([arXiv:2312.09814](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09814))

That the Hubble tension might result from systematics in the [[cosmic microwave background]]:

* Stacy McGaugh, *Early Galaxy Formation and the Hubble Tension* ([arXiv:2312.03127](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03127))
