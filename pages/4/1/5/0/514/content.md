A category is (sometimes) called _pointed_ if it has a [[zero object]].

#Remarks#

* The terminology certainly comes from the fact that every category of [[pointed object]]s is a pointed category.

* In the homotopical context of a [[category of fibrant objects|pointed category of fibrant objects]] many of the familiar constructions from homotopy theory in [[Top]] have analogs.

* Notice that this notion of pointed is _not_ related to usage such as in [[well-pointed topos]].
