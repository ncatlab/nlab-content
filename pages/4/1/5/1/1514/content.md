## Idea

The notion of **path integral** originates in and is mainly used in the context of [[quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum field theory]], where it is a certain operation supposed to model the notion of [[quantization]].

The idea is that the quantum propagator -- in [[FQFT]] the value of the functor $U : Cob \to Vect$ on a certain [[cobordism]] -- is given by an [[integral kernel]] $U : \psi \mapsto \int K(-,y) \psi(y) d\mu$ where $K(x,y)$ is something like the integral of the exponentiated [[action functional]] $S$ over all field configurations $\phi$ with prescribed boundary datat $x$ and $y$. Formally one writes

$$
  K(x,y) = \int \exp(i S(\phi))\; D\phi 
$$

and calls this the **path integral**. Here the expression $D \phi$ is supposed to allude to an  [[measure space|measure integral]] on the space of all $\phi$. The main problem with the path integral idea is that it is typically unclear what this measure should be, or, worse, it is typically clear that no suitable such measure does exist. 

The name _path integral_ originates from the special case where the system is the [[sigma model]] describing a particle on a target space manifold $X$. In this case a field configuration $\phi$ is a path $\phi : [0,1] \to X$ in $X$, hence the integral over all field configurations is an integral over all paths.

The idea of the path integral famously goes back to [[Richard Feynman]], who motivated the idea in [[quantum mechanics]]. In that context the notion can typically be made precise and shown to be equivalent to various other [[quantization]] prescriptions. 

The central impact of the idea of the path integral however is in its application to [[quantum field theory]], where it is often taken in the physics literatire as the _definition_ of what the quantum field theory encoded by an [[action functional]] should be, disregarding the fact that in these contexts it is typically quite unclear what the path integral actually means, precisely. 

Notably the [[Feynman perturbation series]] summing over [[Feynman graphs]] is motivated as one way to make sense of the path integral in quantum field theory and in practice usually serves as a _definition_ of the perturbative path integral.

## Examples

### In quantum mechanics

A simple form of the path integral is realized in [[quantum mechanics]], where it was originally dreamed up by [[Richard Feynman]] and then made precise using the [[Feynman-Kac formula]].  Most calculations in practice are still done using [[perturbation theory]].

The [[Schrödinger equation]] says that the rate at which the phase of an energy eigenvector rotates is proportional to its energy:
\[ i \hbar \frac{d}{dt} \psi = H \psi. \]
Therefore, the probability that the system evolves to the final state $\psi_F$ after evolving for time $t$ from the initial state $\psi_I$ is
\[ \langle \psi_F|e^{-iHt}|\psi_I\rangle.\]
Chop this up into time steps $\Delta t = t/N$ and use the fact that 
\[\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}|q\rangle\langle q| = 1\]
to get
\[ \langle \psi_F| e^{-iH\Delta t} \left(\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |q_{N-1} \rangle \langle q_{N-1}| dq_{N-1}\right) e^{-iH\Delta t} \left(\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |q_{N-2} \rangle \langle q_{N-2}| dq_{N-2}\right) e^{-iH\Delta t} \cdots e^{-iH\Delta t} \left(\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |q_1 \rangle \langle q_1| dq_1\right) e^{-iH\Delta t} |\psi_I\rangle \]
\[ = \int_{q_1} \cdots \int_{q_{N-2}} \int_{q_{N-1}} \langle \psi_F| e^{-iH\Delta t} |q_{N-1} \rangle \langle q_{N-1}| e^{-iH\Delta t} |q_{N-2} \rangle \langle q_{N-2}|  e^{-iH\Delta t} \cdots e^{-iH\Delta t} |q_1 \rangle \langle q_1| e^{-iH\Delta t} |\psi_I\rangle dq_{N-1} dq_{N-2} \cdots dq_1 \]
Assume we have the free Hamiltonian $H=p^2/2m.$  Looking at an individual term $\langle q_{n+1}| e^{-iH\Delta t} |q_{n} \rangle,$ we can insert a factor of 1 and solve to get
\[ \array{\langle q_{n+1}| e^{-iH\Delta t} \left(\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{dp}{2\pi}|p\rangle \langle p|\right)|q_{n} \rangle &=& \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{dp}{2\pi} e^{-ip^2\Delta t/2m} \langle q_{n+1}|p\rangle \langle p|q_{n} \rangle \\ &=& \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{dp}{2\pi} e^{-ip^2\Delta t/2m} e^{ip(q_{n+1}-q_n)} \\ &=& \left(\frac{-i 2\pi m}{\Delta t}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} e^{i \Delta t (m/2)[(q_{n+1}-q_n)/\Delta t]^2}.} \]
Defining
\[\int Dq = \lim_{N \to \infty} \left(\frac{-i 2\pi m}{\Delta t}\right)^{\frac{N}{2}} \prod_{n=0}^{N-1} \int dq_n,\]
and letting $\Delta t \to 0, N \to \infty,$ we get
\[ \langle \psi_F|e^{-iHt}|\psi_I\rangle = \int Dq e^{i \int_0^t dt \frac{1}{2}m \dot{q}^2}. \]

For arbitrary Hamiltonians $H = \frac{p^2}{2m} + V(x),$ we get
\[ \array{\langle \psi_F|e^{-iHt}|\psi_I\rangle &=& \int Dq e^{i \int_0^t dt \frac{1}{2}m \dot{q}^2 - V(x)} \\ &=& \int Dq e^{i\int_0^t\mathcal{L}(\dot{q},q) dt} \\ &=& \int Dq e^{iS(q)}, } \]
where $S(q)$ is the [[action]] functional.

Is there an easy way to see how the Hamiltonian transforms into the Lagrangian in the exponent?

## The path integral in the bigger picture

Ours is the age whose central fundamental theoretical physics question is: 

>_What is [[quantum field theory]]_? 

A closely related question is:

> _What is the path integral_ ? 

After its conception by [[Richard Feynman]] in the middle of the 20th century It was notably [[Edward Witten]]'s achievement in the late 20th century to make clear the vast potential for fundamental physics and pure math underlying the concept of the quantum field theoretic path integral.

And yet, among all the aspects of QFT, the notion of the path integral is the one that has resisted attempts at formalization the most.

While [[FQFT|functorial quantum field theory]] is the formalization of the properties that the _locality_ and the _sewing law_ of the path integral is demanded to have -- whatever the path integral is, it is a process that in the end yields a [[functor]] on a [[(infinity,n)-category of cobordisms]] -- by itself, this sheds no light on what that procedure called "path integration" or "path integral quantization" is.

The single major insight into the right [[higher category theory|higher categorical]] formalization of the path integral is probably the idea indicated in

* [[Dan Freed]]

  * _Quantum groups from path integrals_ ([arXiv](http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/q-alg/9501025))

  * _Higher algebraic structures and quantization_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9212115))

which says that

* it is wrong to think of the _action functional_ that the path integral integrates over as just a _function_: it is a higher categorical object;

* accordingly, the path integral is not something that just controls the numbers or linear maps assigned by a $d$-dimensional [[quantum field theory]] in dimension $d$: also the assignment to higher codimensions is to be regarded as part of the path integral;

  * notably: the fact that quantum mechanics assigns a (Hilbert) space of sections of a vector bundle to codimension 1 is to be regarded as due to a _summing operation_ in the sense of the path integral, too: the space of sections of a vector bundle is the continuum equivalent of the direct sum of its fibers


More recently, one sees attempts to formalize this observation of Freed's, notably in the context of the [[cobordism hypothesis]]:

* [[geometric infinity-function theory]] is used to compute at least something like a path integral in codimension 1 and 2 in the context of [[sigma-model]] QFT;

* see [[path integral as a pull-push transform]]

* and something similar or is indicated in section 3 and section 6 of

  * [[Dan Freed]], [[Mike Hopkins]], [[Jacob Lurie]], [[Constantin Teleman]], _[[Topological Quantum Field Theories from Compact Lie Groups]]_ ([arXiv:0905.0731](http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.0731))



based on material (on categories of "families") in _[[On the Classification of Topological Field Theories]]_ .
