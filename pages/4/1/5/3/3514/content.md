John Henry Constantine Whitehead (11 November 1904&#8211;8 May 1960), was one of the founders of modern algebraic topology. His contributions include
 * CW complexes; these were introduced in his papers on
 * [[combinatorial homotopy]], which in turn were one prime  source of inspiration for [[Ronnie Brown|Brown]], [[Higgins]] and Sivera's, [[Non-abelian algebraic topology]] and also for Baues' extensive work on, for instance, [[Combinatorial Homotopy and 4-Dimensional Complexes]];
 * [[simple homotopy theory]];
 * the [[Whitehead group]] which is a precursor of constructions in algebraic K-theory;
 * with [[Saunders Mac Lane]], first characterisation of homotopy 2-types.
 * founder of the [[algebraic homotopy]] programme;
 * one of the founders of the influential journal _Topology_.
