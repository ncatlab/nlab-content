## Idea

The notion of _coframe_ is a generalization of the notion of [[category of closed subsets]] of a [[topological space]]. A _coframe_ is like a category of closed subsets in a space possibly more general than a topological space: a [[locale]]. This in turn is effectively defined to be anything that has a collection of closed subsets that behaves essentially like the closed subsets of a topological space do.

It is also the [[opposite poset]] of a [[frame]]. 

## Definition

###### Definition

A **coframe** $\mathcal{C}$ is 

* a [[partial order|poset]] 

* that has 

  * all [[small limit|small]] [[product|products]], called [[meet|meets]] $\bigwedge$

  * all [[finite colimits]], called [[join|joins]] $\vee$

* and which satisfies the _infinite distributive law_:

  $$ 
    \bigwedge_i (x\vee y_i) \leq x \vee (\bigwedge_i y_i)
  $$

  for all $x, \{y_i\}_i$ in $A$

  (Note that the converse holds in any case, so we have equality.)

A _coframe homomorphism_ is a homomorphism of posets that preserves finite joins and arbitrary meets. Coframes and coframe homomorphisms form the category Cofrm.
