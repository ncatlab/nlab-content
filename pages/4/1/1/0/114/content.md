#Definition#

The **target object** of a [[morphism]] $f : x \to y$ in some [[category]] is the [[object]] $y$. 

Given a category [[internal category|internal to]] $C$ with object of objects $C_0$ and object of morphisms $C_1$, a **target morphism** is a morphism $t:C_1\to C_0$ that maps each morphism in $C_1$ to its target object in $C_0$.

The target is also sometimes called the 'codomain'.
