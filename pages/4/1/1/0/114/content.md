#Definition#

The **target object**, or simply **target**, of a [[morphism]] $f: x \to y$ in some [[category]] $C$ is the [[object]] $y$.  The target of $f$ is also called its **codomain**, since the dual concept (the [[source]]) is also called 'domain'.

Given a [[small category]] $C$ with set of objects $C_0$ and set of morphisms $C_1$, the **target function** of $C$ is the function $t: C_1 \to C_0$ that maps each morphism in $C_1$ to its target object in $C_0$.

Generalising this, given an [[internal category]] $C$ with object of objects $C_0$ and object of morphisms $C_1$, the **target morphism** of $C$ is the morphism $t: C_1 \to C_0$ that is part of the definition of internal category.
