## Idea

In [[physics]], natural units are [[physical units]] of measurements in which only universal physical constants like $c$, $G$, $\hbar$, $\epsilon_0$, etc are used as defining constants, by setting some of them equal to 1. 

Examples of natural units used in physics include Planck units, Stoney units, Hartree units, particle physics natural units, QCD units, and Schr√∂dinger units.
