## Idea

While a (left or right) [[adjoint]] to a [[functor]] may be understood as the best approximation (from one side or the other) of a possibly non-existent [[inverse]], any pair of [[adjoint functors]] restricts to a [[equivalence of categories]] on [[subcategories]]. These subcategories are sometimes known as the _center_ of the adjunction, their objects are sometimes known as the _fixed points_ of the adjunction.

The [[equivalences of categories]] that arise from fixed points of adjunctions this way are often known as [[dualities]]. Examples include _[[Pontrjagin duality]]_, _[[Gelfand duality]]_, _[[Stone duality]]_, and the _[[Isbell duality]]_ between [[commutative rings]] and [[affine schemes]] (see [Porst-Tholen 91](#PorstTholen91)).

## Definition

###### Proposition
**(fixed point equivalence of an adjunction)**

Let

$$
  \mathcal{D}
    \underoverset
      {\underset{ R }{\longrightarrow}}
      {\overset{ L }{\longleftarrow}}
      {\phantom{AA}\bot\phantom{AA}}
  \mathcal{C}
$$

be a pair of [[adjoint functors]]. Say that 

1. an [[object]] $c \in \mathcal{C}$ is a _fixed point of the adjunction_ if its  [[adjunction unit]] is an [[isomorphism]]

   $$
     c \underoverset{\simeq}{\eta_c}{\longrightarrow} R L (c)
   $$

   and write 

   $$
     \mathcal{C}_{fix} \hookrightarrow \mathcal{C}
   $$

   for the [[full subcategory]] on these fixed objects;


1. an [[object]] $d \in \mathcal{D}$ is a _fixed point of the adjunction_ if its  [[adjunction counit]] is an [[isomorphism]]

   $$
    L R(d) \underoverset{\simeq}{\epsilon_d}{\longrightarrow} d
   $$

   and write 

   $$
     \mathcal{D}_{fix} \hookrightarrow \mathcal{D}
   $$

   for the [[full subcategory]] on these fixed objects.


Then the [[adjunction]] ([[corestriction|co]]-)[[restriction|restrics]] to an [[adjoint equivalence]] on these [[full subcategories]] of [[fixed points]]:

$$
  \mathcal{D}_{fix}
    \underoverset
      {\underset{ R }{\longrightarrow}}
      {\overset{ L }{\longleftarrow}}
      {\phantom{A}\phantom{{}_{\bot}}\simeq_{\bot}\phantom{A}}
  \mathcal{C}_{fix}
$$

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

It is sufficient to see that the functors ([[corestriction|co-]])[[restriction|restrict]] as claimed, for then the restricted adjunction unit/counit are [[isomorphisms]] by definition, and hence exhibit an [[adjoint equivalence]].

Hence we need to show that 

1. for $c \in \mathcal{C}_{fix} \hookrightarrow \mathcal{C}$ we have that $\epsilon_{L(c)}$ is an [[isomorphism]];

1. for $d \in \mathcal{D}_{fix} \hookrightarrow \mathcal{D}$ we have that $\eta_{R(d)}$ is an [[isomorphism]].

For the first case we claim that $L(\eta_{c})$ provides an [[inverse morphism|inverse]]: by the [[triangle identity]] it is a [[right inverse]], but by assumption it is itself an [[invertible morphism]], which implies that $\epsilon_{L(c)}$ is an isomorphism.

The second claim is [[formal duality|formally dual]].

\begin{remark}
Notice the above theorem and proof are valid in any [[2-category]] admitting [[inverters]]. In fact $\mathcal{C}_{fix}$ and $\mathcal{D}_{fix}$ can be presented, respectively, as the inverter of the unit and the counit of the adjunction.
Then the proof only uses the unit/counit definition of adjunction, which is valid in every 2-category (see [[adjunction]]) and general facts about invertibility.
\end{remark}


## Properties

* If the adjunction is [[idempotent adjunction|idempotent]], then the fixed objects in $\mathcal{C}$ are precisely those of the form $G d$, and dually the fixed objects in $\mathcal{D}$ are those of the form $F c$.  Indeed, this is essentially the definition of an idempotent adjunction.

* At the other extreme, it may be the case that there are no fixed points of an adjunction, and the restriction to an equivalence is between empty categories. An example is the adjunction between sets and [[pointed sets]]. The left adjoint adjoins a new distinguished point and the right adjoint forgets which point is chosen. In this case, the unit of the adjunction is never surjective and so is never an isomorphism. This can be generalized to any algebraic theory that has a non-trivial constant. These examples give adjunctions which are "maximally non-idempotent".

## Examples
 {#Examples}

### Gelfand duality
 {#GelfandDuality}

[[Gelfand duality]] is (a further restriction of) the fixed point equivalence of the adjunction between [[compactly generated topological spaces|compactly generated]] [[Hausdorff spaces]] and [[topological algebras]] over the [[complex numbers]], given by using the [[complex numbers]] as [[dualizing object]] ([Porst-Tholen 91, section 4-c](#PorstTholen91)).
