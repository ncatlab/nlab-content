## Idea

The term "support" means different things in different parts of mathematics:

### In set theory

Given $f \colon X \to A$ a [[function]] to  $A$ a [[pointed set]] with the point playing the role of a [[zero]] [[generalized element|element]], then the _support_ of $f$ is the [[subobject]] of $X$ on which $f$ is non-zero.

The support $[X]$ of any set $X$ is represented by the support of the unique function into any [[singleton]], and is thus a [[subsingleton]].  

### In category theory

The [[support object]] of an [[object]] $A$ of a [[category]] is the [[image]] of its map to the [[terminal object]].

In the [[internal logic]] of a category, this corresponds to the [[propositional truncation]].

### In topology
 {#InTopology}

In [[topology]] the support of a [[continuous function]] $f \colon X \to A$ as above is the [[topological closure]] of the set of points on which $f$ does not vanish:

$$
  Supp(f) = Cl(\{x \in X \vert f(x) \neq 0 \in A\})
  \,.
$$

If $Supp(f) \subset X$ is a [[compact subspace]], then one says that $f$ has _[[compact support]]_.

### In functional analysis

* [[support of a distribution]]

### In measure theory

* [[tau-additive measure#null_sets_and_support|Support of a measure]]
* [[valuation (measure theory)#null_sets_and_support|Support of a valuation]]

### In field theory

* [[spacetime support]]
