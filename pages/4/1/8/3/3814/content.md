#Idea
The standard model of particle physics is a model of three of the fundamental forces of physics in the language of [[quantum field theory]], in particular it is a [[gauge theory]]. Although there are several approaches to formulate a mathematically precise definition of what a [[quantum field theory]] is, there is no rigorous formulation (yet) that comprises the whole standard model. 

#References
For a dictionary (work in progress) of the language of mathematicians and physicists see:

* [[domenicofiorenza:The standard model]]

* Wikipedia on the [standard model] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model)

There are tons of textbooks about the standard model, so any recommendation is hopelessly biased.
The following textbook is a short and relativly easy introduction that nevertheless covers a lot of ground:
