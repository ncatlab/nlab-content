For a classical mechanical system, the laws of motion can be expressed in terms of action principle: the actual paths must be the (locally) extremal paths of the [[action functional]]. 

In one of the formulations of the classical mechanics, called Lagrangean formalism, every mechanical system is characterized by its configuration space and a single function called Lagrangian which determines the laws of motion (the initial configuration should be given independently).

The **Lagrangian**, Lagrangian function or Lagrangean $L = L(q,\stackrel{\cdot}q,t)$ is a real valued function of the points in [[configuration space]] and their time derivatives (for some sytems also depending on time), such that the corresponding action principle can be expressed as [[Euler-Lagrange equation]]s: for all $i$, 

$$
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \stackrel{\cdot}{q}_i} \right) - \frac{\partial L}{\partial {q}_i}  = 0
$$

Here $q = (q_1,\ldots, q_n)$ is the coordinate in the configuration space. 

For continuum systems satisfying reasonable locality, Lagrangians can be expressed in terms of integrating a local quantity, so-called Lagrangian density.
