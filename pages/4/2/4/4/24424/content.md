Welcome to my webpage! I'm too lazy to create a proper website so I'm using this nLab entry instead. (I'll try to add a picture of my face later.)

I'm a French [[math]] PhD student at the University of Ottawa. My supervisor is [[Rick Blute]]. [[Phil Scott]] was also my supervisor.

I'm interested in the [[logic|logical]] approach to [[differentiation]] through [[differential linear logic]] and [[differential categories]]. I like trying to combine ideas from this field with the notion of [[graded modality]] to talk about ubiquitous functors in mathematics such as [[symmetric powers|symmetric]], [[exterior powers|exterior]], [[divided powers]] or [[homology |homology functors]]. 

More broadly, I'm driven by the idea of turning some algebraic concepts from [[mathematics]] into [[category theory]] and [[proof theory]] and make everything live together in the neatest way. 

I like the philosophy of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and think that it is a useful inspiration for research in mathematics and computer science.

##  Work in progress and projects

1. _Extracting an $\mathbb{N}$-filtered differential modality from a differential modality._ Status on 13 February 2024: almost completely written, should be on the arXiv in a few days.

2. _Relative differential categories:_ replace the monad with a relative monad in the definition of a differential category. Status on 13 February 2024: will finish to write this after the extracting paper.

3. _Glueing an $\mathbb{N}$-filtered differential modality into a differential modality._ Status on 13 February 2024: did not start to write but I think it's going to work fine quickly.

4. _Hasse-Schimdt differential categories:_ replace usual differentiation by [[Hasse-Schmidt derivative|Hasse-Schmidt differentiation]] in the notion of a differential category. Status on 13 February 2024: will work on this once the extracting paper is finished. The higher-order rules from the extracting paper are needed to write down the definition of an Hasse-Schmidt differential category.

5. _Higher-order tangent categories:_ a categorical framework for higher-order tangent bundles similar to [[tangent bundle category|tangent bundle categories]]. Status on 13 February 2024: keeping this for later --- when I'll start to work seriously on tangent categories.
