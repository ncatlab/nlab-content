I'm a French [[math]]/[[computer science]] student based in Ottawa. I'm doing a PhD (I'm in first year), my supervisors are [[Rick Blute]] and [[Phil Scott]].

 I'm interested by the [[logic|logical]] approach to [[differentiation]] through [[differential linear logic]] and [[differential categories]]. I like trying to combine ideas from this field with the notion of [[graded modality]] to talk about ubiquitous functors in mathematics such as [[symmetric powers|symmetric]], [[exterior powers|exterior]], [[divided powers]] or [[homology |homology functors]]. 

More broadly, I'm driven by the idea of making some algebraic concepts from [[mathematics]] into [[category theory]] and [[proof theory]] and make everything live together in the neatest way. 

I like the philosophy of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and think that it is a useful inspiration for research in mathematics and computer science. 

## Projects

I wrote a paper on this:

- Graded differential linear logic and graded differential categories which index the [[exponential modality]] of differential linear logic or differential categories by a [[rig]]. The project includes graded kinds of [[Seely isomorphism]]. (with [[Jean-Simon Lemay]])

Iâ€™m writing a paper on:

- A [[string diagrams|string-diagrammatic]] calculus for [[symmetric powers]] based on an algebraic characterization of symmetric powers in symmetric monoidal $\mathbb{Q}^{+}$-linear categories.

I want to write papers on:

- Categorical framework for [[jet bundles]] similar to [[tangent bundle category|tangent bundle categories]].
- Higher-order differential linear logic and higher-order differential categories which replace differentiation by [[Hasse-Schmidt derivative|Hasse-Schmidt differentiation]].
