I'm a french math/computer science student. I finished my masters program as a visitor in Ottawa under the supervision of [[Rick Blute]] and [[Phil Scott]] and I'm going to continue with them as a PhD student.

I'm interested by the logical approach to differentiation through differential linear logic and differential categories. My work currently tries to combine ideas from these fields with the notion of graded exponential modality to clarify the functioning of ubiquitous functors in mathematics such as symmetric, exterior, divided powers or homology functors.

I'm preparing a paper which starts this program with symmetric powers in characteristic $0$:

Title: Symmetric powers as a symmetric bimonoid

Abstract: In a symmetric monoidal $\mathbb{Q}^{+}$-linear category, the families of all symmetric powers of an object are characterized among the countable families of objects as those being equippable with operations which endow the family with an algebraic structure which we call symmetric bimonoid.
