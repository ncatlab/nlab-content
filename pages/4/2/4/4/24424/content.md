I'm a French [[math]]/[[computer science]] student. I finished my masters program as a visitor in Ottawa under the supervision of [[Rick Blute]] and [[Phil Scott]] and I now continue with them as a PhD student.
 
I'm interested by the [[logic|logical]] approach to [[differentiation]] through [[differential linear logic]] and [[differential categories]]. My work currently tries to combine ideas from these fields with the notion of [[graded modality]] to clarify the functioning of ubiquitous functors in mathematics such as [[symmetric powers|symmetric]], [[exterior powers|exterior]], [[divided powers]] or [[homology |homology functors]].

I currently work on this stuff:

- Graded differential linear logic and graded differential categories (with [[Jean-Simon Lemay]]) which index the exponential modality of differential linear logic or differential categories by any [[rig]].
- Higher-order differential linear logic and higher-order differential categories which replace differentiation by [[Hasse-Schmidt derivative|Hasse-Schmidt differentiation]].
- A [[string diagrams|string-diagrammatic]] calculus for [[symmetric powers]] based on an algebraic characterization of symmetric powers in symmetric monoidal $\mathbb{Q}^{+}$-linear categories.
