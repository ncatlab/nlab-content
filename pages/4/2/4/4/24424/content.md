I'm a French [[math]]/[[computer science]] student based in Ottawa. I'm doing a PhD, my supervisors are [[Rick Blute]] and [[Phil Scott]].

 I'm interested by the [[logic|logical]] approach to [[differentiation]] through [[differential linear logic]] and [[differential categories]]. I like trying to combine ideas from this field with the notion of [[graded modality]] to talk about ubiquitous functors in mathematics such as [[symmetric powers|symmetric]], [[exterior powers|exterior]], [[divided powers]] or [[homology |homology functors]]. 

More broadly, I'm driven by the idea of making some algebraic concepts from [[mathematics]] into [[category theory]] and [[proof theory]] and make everything live together in the neatest way. 

I like the philosophy of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and think that it is a useful inspiration for research in mathematics and computer science. 

## Projects

I wrote a paper on this:

- Graded differential linear logic and graded differential categories which index the [[exponential modality]] of differential linear logic or differential categories by a [[rig]]. The project includes graded kinds of [[Seely isomorphism]]. (with [[Jean-Simon Lemay]])

Iâ€™m writing a paper on:

- A [[string diagrams|string-diagrammatic]] calculus for [[symmetric powers]] based on an algebraic characterization of symmetric powers in symmetric monoidal $\mathbb{Q}^{+}$-linear categories.

I want to write papers on:

- Categorical framework for [[jet bundles]] similar to [[tangent bundle category|tangent bundle categories]] (with [[Rick Blute]], Florian Schwarz and Geoff Vooys).
- Higher-order differential linear logic and higher-order differential categories which replace differentiation by [[Hasse-Schmidt derivative|Hasse-Schmidt differentiation]].

A previous idea which seems to be unsuccessful was:

- Make [[Schur functors]], which are usually used in [[representation theory of  the symmetric group]], into [[string diagrams]] and/or [[linear logic]] by using an [[graded modality|exponential modality]] graded by [[Young diagrams]].

I also have various other more or less fuzzy ideas of projects and I'm open to collaboration if someone is interested by working with me on something. (I gladly share ideas if someone wants to work with me on them. If it produces more results, better results or just accelerate the process of research, that's all good for me.)
