I'm a French [[math]]/[[computer science]] student. I finished my masters program as a visitor in Ottawa under the supervision of [[Rick Blute]] and [[Phil Scott]] and I now continue with them as a PhD student.
 
I'm interested by the [[logic|logical]] approach to [[differentiation]] through [[differential linear logic]] and [[differential categories]]. My work currently tries to combine ideas from these fields with the notion of [[graded modality]] to clarify the functioning of ubiquitous functors in mathematics such as [[symmetric powers|symmetric]], [[exterior powers|exterior]], [[divided powers]] or [[homology |homology functors]]. 

More broadly, I'm driven by the idea of making some algebraic concepts from [[mathematics]] into [[category theory]] and [[proof theory]] and make everything live together in the neatest way, allowing a computational interpretation, a logical analysis, and a maximal generalization of these algebraic concepts while at the same time creating new insights into pure proof theory that will be usable in a more computer-science oriented perspective (eg. I first encountered graded Seely isomorphisms as properties of polynomial algebras before understanding that they are a distinctive feature of graded differential linear logic). 

I like the insights given by the philosophy of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and think they are a useful inspiration for research in mathematics and computer science. At least they are for me although I'm not a philosopher and so I am not able to formalize very precisely my feelings on this. But it does play a role in my thoughts, let's say that I'm inspired by this philosophy.

## Projects

I currently work on this stuff:

- Graded differential linear logic and graded differential categories (with [[Jean-Simon Lemay]]) which index the [[exponential modality]] of differential linear logic or differential categories by any [[rig]].
- Higher-order differential linear logic and higher-order differential categories which replace differentiation by [[Hasse-Schmidt derivative|Hasse-Schmidt differentiation]].
- A [[string diagrams|string-diagrammatic]] calculus for [[symmetric powers]] based on an algebraic characterization of symmetric powers in symmetric monoidal $\mathbb{Q}^{+}$-linear categories.
- Graded kinds of [[Seely isomorphism]].

A next goal is:

- Make [[Schur functors]], which are usually used in [[representation theory of  the symmetric group]], into [[string diagrams]] and/or [[linear logic]] by using an [[graded modality|exponential modality]] graded by [[Young diagrams]].
