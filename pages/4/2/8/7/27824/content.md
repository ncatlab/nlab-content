## Idea

A [[duality]] [[axiom]] used in various branches of [[synthetic mathematics]], such as 

* [[synthetic algebraic geometry]] 

* [[synthetic (infinity,1)-category theory]]

* [[synthetic domain theory]]

* [[synthetic topology]]

  * [[synthetic Stone duality]]

* [[synthetic differential geometry]]

The axiom of synthetic quasi-coherence is a more general version of the [[Kock-Lawvere axiom]] in [[synthetic differential geometry]] as it can apply to [[algebras]] of a generic [[model]] of a [[Horn theory]] rather than just the [[Weil algebras]] of a generic [[local ring]]. 

## Definition

Let $\mathbb{T}$ be a [[Horn theory]] and let $U_\mathbb{T}$ be the generic [[model]] of the theory $\mathbb{T}$. A *[[homomorphism]]* between two models of $\mathbb{T}$ is a [[function]] which preserves all the [[signature (in logic)|signatures]] of the theory $\mathbb{T}$. An *$U_\mathbb{T}$-algebra* consists of a $\mathbb{T}$-model $A$ with a homomorphism $h:U_\mathbb{T} \to A$. An *$U_\mathbb{T}$-algebra homomorphism* on an $U_\mathbb{T}$-algebra $A$ is a homomorphism from $A$ to $U_\mathbb{T}$. The *[[spectrum]]* of $A$ is the set of $U_\mathbb{T}$-algebra homomorphisms: 

$$\mathrm{Spec}(A) \coloneqq \mathrm{hom}_{U_\mathbb{T}\mathrm{Alg}}(A, U_\mathbb{T})$$

An $U_\mathbb{T}$-algebra $A$ is **quasi-coherent** if the canonical evaluation homomorphism

$$\lambda a.\lambda f.f(a):A \to {U_\mathbb{T}}^{\mathrm{Spec}(A)}$$

is an [[isomorphism]]. 

\begin{definition}
The **axiom SQCP** or **synthetic quasi-coherence for the univariate polynomial algebra** states that the free $U_\mathbb{T}$-algebra on one generator $U_\mathbb{T}[x]$ is quasi-coherent.
\end{definition} 

[[Phoa's principle]] for [[distributive lattices]] is equivalent in strength to the axiom SQCP for $U_\mathbb{T}$-algebras where $\mathbb{T}$ is the [[Lawvere theory]] of [[distributive lattices]]. 

An $U_\mathbb{T}$-algebra $A$ is *finitely quotiented* if there is a [[natural number]] $n$ and two [[finite set|finite]] families of elements $a, b:\mathrm{Fin}(n) \to U_\mathbb{T}$ in the generic model such that $A$ is [[isomorphic]] to the quotient algebra $U_\mathbb{T} / a = b$. 

\begin{definition}
The **axiom SQCI** or **synthetic quasi-coherence for finitely quotiented algebras** states that every finitely quotiented $U_\mathbb{T}$-algebra of $U_\mathbb{T}$ is quasi-coherent. 
\end{definition}

In applications to [[synthetic algebraic geometry]] and [[synthetic (infinity,1)-category theory]], one usually considers the notion of synthetic quasi-coherence as applying to finitely presented algebras: A *[[finitely presented]] $U_\mathbb{T}$-algebra* is an $U_\mathbb{T}$-algebra $A$ which is isomorphic to a quotient of the free $U_\mathbb{T}$-algebra on a [[finite set]] of [[generators]]. 

\begin{definition}
The **axiom SQCF** or **synthetic quasi-coherence for finitely presented algebras** states that all finitely presented $U_\mathbb{T}$-algebras $A$ are quasi-coherent.
\end{definition}

In applications to [[synthetic topology]], such as [[synthetic Stone duality]], as well as [[synthetic domain theory]], one usually considers the notion of synthetic quasi-coherence as applying to countably presented algebras: A *countably presented $U_\mathbb{T}$-algebra* is an $U_\mathbb{T}$-algebra $A$ which is isomorphic to a quotient of the free $U_\mathbb{T}$-algebra on a [[countable set]] of [[generators]]. 

\begin{definition}
The **axiom SQCC** or **synthetic quasi-coherence for countably presented algebras** states that all countably presented $U_\mathbb{T}$-algebras $A$ are quasi-coherent. 
\end{definition}

In applications to [[synthetic differential geometry]], one considers Artinian $U_\mathbb{T}$-algebras, i.e. $U_\mathbb{T}$-algebras that satisfy the [[descending chain condition]]. 

\begin{definition}
The **axiom SQCA** or **synthetic quasi-coherence for Artinian algebras** states that all Artinian $U_\mathbb{T}$-algebras are quasi-coherent. 
\end{definition}

The [[Kock-Lawvere axiom]] is the axiom of synthetic quasi-coherence for Artinian $U_\mathbb{T}$-algebras with $\mathbb{T}$ the [[Horn theory]] of a [[local ring]] (hence by the definitions given on this page, every $U_\mathbb{T}$-algebra is a local ring and every Artinian $U_\mathbb{T}$-algebra is a [[Weil algebra]]).
