## Disambiguation

By *setoid objects* one will means [[objects]] equipped with *[[setoid]]*-[[structure]] [[internalization|internal]] to suitable ambient [[categories]]. Setoid objects [[internalization|internal]] to [[Set]] are ordinary [[setoids]].

Similarly to how the plain term *[[setoids]]* may refer to [[sets]] ([[objects]] of the category [[Set]]) equipped with either an [[equivalence relation]] or to sets equipped with a  [[pseudo-equivalence relation]], so the term *setoid object* in a [[finitely complete category]] may refer to either

* an [[object]] quipped with an [[internal equivalence relation]] (i.e. a [[congruence]])

* an [[object]] equipped with an [[internal pseudo-equivalence relation]].
