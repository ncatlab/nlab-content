## Disambiguation

Similarly to how a [[setoid]] can refer to a set with either an [[equivalence relation]] or a [[pseudo-equivalence relation]], a *setoid [[object]]* in a [[finitely complete category]] can refer to either

* an [[object]] with an [[internal equivalence relation]] (i.e. a [[congruence]])

* an [[object]] with an [[internal pseudo-equivalence relation]]. 

## Related concepts
