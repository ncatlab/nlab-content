In [[supergravity]] theory, certain extremal solutions have some of the [[supersymmetry|supersymmetries]] retained. These are the so-called __Bogomol'nyi--Prasad--Sommerfield saturated solutions__ which exist also in some models of soliton theory
(English Wikipedia: [Bogomol'nyi&#8211;Prasad&#8211;Sommerfield bound](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogomol'nyi%E2%80%93Prasad%E2%80%93Sommerfield_bound)). Namely, the fact that a certain fraction (typically one half or fourth of supersymmetry generators) of supersymmetry is retained implies the saturation of the BPS-bound, which does make sense a bit more generally. The retained generators generate a nontrivial subalgebra of the full supersymmetry algebra and carry conserved charges; the mass is exactly determined in terms of these charges.

In geometric models, like variants of the [[superstring theory]], it is very important to investigate [[moduli space]]s of classical vacua (e.g. the ground states for the D-[[brane]] systems). BPS-states correspond just to a part of the moduli problem which is often the most tractable.

Several mathematical theories in [[geometry]] are interpreted as counting BPS-states in the sense of integration on appropriate compactification of the moduli space of BPS-states in a related physical model attached to the underlying geometry: most notably the Gromov--Witten invariants, Donaldson--Thomas invariants and the Thomas--Pandharipande invariants; all the three seem to be deeply interrelated though they are defined in rather very different terms. The compactification of the moduli space involves various stability conditions.
