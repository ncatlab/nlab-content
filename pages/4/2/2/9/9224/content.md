## Idea

In [[probability theory]] the _expectation value_ of a _[[random variable]]_ or _[[observable]]_ is to be thought of as the _[[mean]]_ value of that variable/observable under the given [[probabilities]].

Taking the concept of expectation value as the primary concept ([Whittle 92](#Whittle92)) leads to _[[quantum probability theory]]_.

## Definition

For $(X, \mu)$ a [[measure space]] of finite total measure $\int_X \mu$ and for $f$ an [[measurable function]] on $X$, a _[[random variable]]_, then its **expectation value** is 

$$
  \langle f\rangle
  \coloneqq
  \frac{\int_X f \cdot \mu}{\int_X \mu}
 \,.
$$

In terms of the [[probability measure]] $\mu_P \coloneqq \frac{1}{\int_X \mu} \mu$ this is simply the [[integral]]

$$
  \langle f\rangle
  = 
 \int_X f \cdot \mu_P
  \,.
$$

## In terms of probability monads

For classical probability (not quantum), spaces equipped with a notion of expectation value can be modeled as [[algebra over a monad|algebras]] over a [[probability monad]].
See [[probability monad#algebras_expectation_values|probability monad - algebras]] for more.
