## Idea

In the study of [[computability]], [[descriptive set theory]], etc, by _Baire space_ is meant the [[topological space]] $\mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}}$ of infinite sequences of [[natural numbers]] equipped with the [[product topology]].

The [[continuous functions]] from Baire space to itself serve the role of _computable functions_ in [[computable analysis]]. See at _[[computable function (analysis)]]_.

The Baire space is homeomorphic to the space of [[irrational numbers]], considered as a subspace of the [[real numbers]] equipped with its usual [[Euclidean topology]]. See [[continued fraction]] for discussion of this point.
