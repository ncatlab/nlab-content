## Idea

A [[functor]] $F : C \to D$ is **final**, if we can restrict [[diagram]]s on $D$ to diagrams on $C$ along $F$ without changing their [[colimit]].  

Dually, a functor is **initial** if pulling back diagrams along it does not change the [[limit]]s of these diagrams.

Beware that this property is pretty much unrelated to that of a functor being an [[initial object]] or [[terminal object]] in the [[functor category]] $[C,D]$.  The terminology comes instead from the fact that an object $d\in D$ is initial (resp. terminal) just when the corresponding functor $d:1\to D$ is initial (resp. final).

**Warning:**  In older references (and also some others like [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT]]), final functors are sometimes called *cofinal*, the terminology having been imported from order theory (e.g. [[cofinality]]).  However, this is confusing in category theory because usually the prefix "co-" denotes dualization.  In at least one place ([Borceux](#fb)) this non-dualization was treated as a dualization and the word "final" used for the *dual* concept, but in general it seems that the consensus is to use "final" for what used to be called "cofinal", and "initial" for the dual concept (since "co-final" would be ambiguous).  For example, Johnstone in [[Sketches of an Elephant]] before Proposition B2.5.12 says:
: Traditionally, final functors were called 'cofinal functors'; but this use of 'co' is potentially misleading as it has nothing to do with dualization — it is derived from the Latin 'cum' rather than 'contra' — and so it is now generally omitted.

## Definition

###### Definition


A [[functor]] $F : C \to D$ is **final** if for every [[object]] $d \in D$ the [[comma category]] $(d/F)$ is non-empty and [[connected category|connected]].

A [[functor]] $F : C \to D$ is **initial** if the [[opposite category|opposite]] $F^{op} : C^{op} \to D^{op}$ is final, i.e. if for every [[object]] $d \in D$ the [[comma category]] $(F/d)$ is non-empty and [[connected category|connected]].

###### Proposition

If $F : C \to D$ is final then $C$ is connected precisely if $D$ is.

+-- {: .num_prop #Stability}
###### Proposition


If $F_1$ and $F_2$ are final, then so is their composite $F_1 \circ F_2$.

If $F_2$ and the composite $F_1 \circ F_2$ are final, then so is $F_1$.

If $F_1$ is a [[full and faithful functor]] and the composite is final, then both functors seperately are final.

The first two statements of Proposition \ref{Stability} in fact follow
from the stability properties of orthogonal factorization systems:

###### Proposition

Final functors and [discrete fibrations](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/discrete+fibration) form an [orthogonal factorization system](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/orthogonal+factorization+system).

## Generalizations

The generalization of the notion of final functor from [[category theory]] to [[(∞,1)-category|(∞,1)]]-[[higher category theory]] is described at

* [[final (∞,1)-functor]].

The characterization of final functors is also a special case of the characterization of [[exact squares]].


## Examples
 {#Examples}

+-- {: .num_example }
###### Example

If $D$ has a [[terminal object]] then the functor $F : {*} \to D$ that picks that terminal object is final: for every $d \in D$ the [[comma category]] $d/F$ is equivalent to $*$.  The converse is also true: if a functor $*\to D$ is final, then its image is a terminal object.

  In this case the statement about preservation of colimits states that the colimit over a category with a terminal object is the value of the diagram at that object. Which is also readily checked directly.

###### Example

Every [[right adjoint|right]] [[adjoint functor]] is final.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let $(L \dashv R) : C \to D$ be a pair of [[adjoint functors]].To see that $R$ is final, we may for instance check that for all $d \in D$ the comma category $d / R$ is non-empty and connected:

It is non-empty because it contains the [[unit of an adjunction|adjunction unit]] $(L(d), d \to R L (d))$. Similarly, for 

$$
  \array{
    && d
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{f}}\swarrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{g}}
    \\
    R(a) &&&& R(b)
  }
$$

two objects, they are connected by a zig-zag going through the unit, by the [universal factorization property](#http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/adjoint%20functor#UniversalArrows) of adjunctions

$$
  \array{
    && d
    \\
    & \swarrow &\downarrow& \searrow
    \\
    R(a) &\stackrel{R \bar f}{\leftarrow}& R L (d)& \stackrel{R(\bar g)}{\to} & R(b)
  }
  \,.

###### Example

The inclusion of the [[cospan]] [[diagram]] into its [[cocone]]

       a
       \\
       \downarrow

  \right)
  \hookrightarrow
  \left(
    \array{
       a
       \\
       \downarrow & \searrow
       \\
       c &\longrightarrow & p  
       \\
       \uparrow & \nearrow
       \\
       b
    }
  \right)

is initial.

###### Remark

By the characterization ([here](overcategory#LimitsInSliceViaLimitsOfCoconedDiagram)) of limits in a [[slice category]], this implies that [[fiber products]] in a [[slice category]] are computed as fiber products in the underlying category, or in other words that [[dependent sum]] to the point preserves fiber products.
