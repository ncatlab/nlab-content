## Idea

A [[functor]] $F : C \to D$ is **cofinal**, or just **final**, if we can restrict [[diagram]]s on $D$ to diagrams on $C$ along $F$ without changing their [[colimit]].  the dual notion is an **initial** functor.

## Cofinal functors

A [[functor]] $F : C \to D$ is **cofinal** if for every [[object]] $d \in D$ the [[comma category]] $(F/d)$ is non-empty and [[connected category|connected]].


## Generalizations

The generalization of the notion of cofinal functor from [[category theory]] to [[(∞,1)-category|(∞,1)]]-[[higher category theory]] is described at

* [[cofinal (∞,1)-functor]].
