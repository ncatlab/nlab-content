## Idea

A [[functor]] $F \colon C \to D$ is **final**, if restricting [[diagrams]] along $F$ does not change their [[colimit]].  

Dually, a functor is **initial** if pulling back diagrams along it does not change the [[limits]] of these diagrams.

Beware that this property is pretty much unrelated to that of a functor being an [[initial object]] or [[terminal object]] in the [[functor category]] $[C,D]$.  The terminology comes instead from the fact that an object $d\in D$ is initial (resp. terminal) just when the corresponding functor $d \colon 1\to D$ is initial (resp. final).


\begin{remark}\label{WarningOnTerminology}
**(warning on terminology)**
\linebreak
In older references (and also some others like *[[Higher Topos Theory|HTT]]*), final functors are sometimes called *cofinal*, the terminology having been imported from [[order theory]] (cf. *[[cofinality]]*).  However, this is confusing in [[category theory]] because usually the prefix "co-" denotes [[formal dual|dualization]].  In at least one place ([Borceux](#fb)) this non-dualization was treated as a dualization and the word "final" used for the *dual* concept, but in general it seems that the consensus is to use "final" for what used to be called "cofinal", and "initial" for the dual concept (since "co-final" would be ambiguous).  For example, [[Peter Johnstone|Johnstone]] in *[[Sketches of an Elephant]]* says (before Proposition B2.5.12 ):

> Traditionally, final functors were called 'cofinal functors'; but this use of 'co' is potentially misleading as it has nothing to do with dualization — it is derived from the Latin 'cum' rather than 'contra' — and so it is now generally omitted.

See also the warning at *[[final (infinity,1)-functor|final $(\infty,1)$-functor]]* ([here](final+infinity1-functor#CofinalTerminologyWarning)).

## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition


A [[functor]] $F : C \to D$ is **final** if for every [[object]] $d \in D$ the [[comma category]] $(d/F)$ is (non-empty and) [[connected category|connected]] (the non-emptiness condition is redundant since connected categories are non-empty by convention).

A [[functor]] $F : C \to D$ is **initial** if the [[opposite category|opposite]] $F^{op} : C^{op} \to D^{op}$ is final, i.e. if for every [[object]] $d \in D$ the [[comma category]] $(F/d)$ is [[connected category|connected]].

If $F : C \to D$ is final then $C$ is connected precisely if $D$ is.

+-- {: .num_prop #Stability}
###### Proposition

If $F_1$ and $F_2$ are final, then so is their composite $F_1 \circ F_2$.

If $F_2$ and the composite $F_1 \circ F_2$ are final, then so is $F_1$.

Final functors are stable under [[pushout]]. 

The [[coproduct]] of final functors in the [[arrow category]] $\mathbf{Cat}^{\mathbf{2}}$ is a final functor. 

If $F_1$ is a [[full and faithful functor]] and the composite is final, then both functors seperately are final.

## Generalizations

### Exact squares

The characterization of final functors is a special case of the characterization of [[exact squares]].

### Final enriched functors 
 {#FinalityForWeightedLimits}

Finality for [[enriched functors]] with respect to [[weighted colimits]] (for enrichment in a [[cartesian closed category]]) is discussed in [Kelly 1982 §4.5](#Kelly82): see Theorem 4.67 in particular.

See also discussion of finality specifically for [[coends]] (initiality for [[weighted limits]] and [[ends]]) by:

* [[Tim Campion]]: *Cofinality for Coends* (2020) &lbrack;[MO:q/353876](https://mathoverflow.net/q/353876/381), [MO:a/354097](https://mathoverflow.net/a/354097/381)&rbrack;

### Final $\infty$-functors

The generalization of the notion of final functor from [[category theory]] to [[(∞,1)-category|(∞,1)]]-[[higher category theory]] is described at

* [[final (∞,1)-functor]].




## Examples
 {#Examples}

\begin{example}
  \label{InclusionOfATerminalObjectIsFinal}
**([[subcategory|inclusion]] of a [[terminal object]] is [[final functor]])** \linebreak
If $D$ has a [[terminal object]] then the functor $F : {*} \to D$ that picks that terminal object is final: for every $d \in D$ the [[comma category]] $d/F$ is equivalent to $*$.  The converse is also true: if a functor $*\to D$ is final, then its image is a terminal object.

In this case the statement about preservation of colimits states that the colimit over a category with a terminal object is the value of the diagram at that object. Which is also readily checked directly.  
\end{example}

More generally (see Lemma 3.7 of [Clarke 2024](#Clarke2024)):

\begin{lemma}
A functor whose domain is a [[discrete category]] is final if and only if it is a [[right adjoint]], in which case the functor is [[fully faithful]].
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
That every right adjoint functor is final is proven below. For the converse, suppose that we have a final functor $F : C \to D$ where $C$ is discrete. Finality says that, for each $d \in D$, $d \downarrow F$ is connected:
- Nonemptyness of $d \downarrow F$ says that there exists some $c_d \in C$ and morphism $\eta_d : d \to F(c_d)$ in $D$.
- The existence of a path between any pair of objects says that, given any $c, c' \in C$ and [[span]] $F(c) \leftarrow d \rightarrow F(c')$, we have $c = c'$ and that the two legs are equal.

Consequently, we have an assignment $|D| \to |C|$ sending $d \mapsto c_d$. For this to be an adjunction, we must have $C(c_d, c') \cong D(d, R(c'))$. Since $C$ is discrete, this says that there exists at most one morphism $d \to R(c')$ in $D$, and there exists a morphism iff $c_d = c'$. If $c_d = c'$, then we take $\eta_d$. Conversely, if there exists $d \to R(c')$, we necessarily have $c' = c_d$ by the path existence property.

Full faithfulness now follows, since $D(Fc, Fc') \cong C(c_{Fc}, c') = C(c, c')$.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}\label{FinalFunctorBetweenGroupoids}
  A functor between [[groupoids]] is final iff it is [[essentially surjective functor|essentially surjective]] and [[full functor|full]].
\end{example}
(eg. [Cigoli 2018, Prop. 1.1](#Cigoli18))

###### Example

Every [[right adjoint|right]] [[adjoint functor]] is final.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let $(L \dashv R) : C \to D$ be a pair of [[adjoint functors]].To see that $R$ is final, we may for instance check that for all $d \in D$ the comma category $d / R$ is non-empty and connected:

It is non-empty because it contains the [[unit of an adjunction|adjunction unit]] $(L(d), d \to R L (d))$. Similarly, for 

$$
  \array{
    && d
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{f}}\swarrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{g}}
    \\
    R(a) &&&& R(b)
  }
$$

two objects, they are connected by a zig-zag going through the unit, by the [[adjoint functor#UniversalArrows|universal factorization property]] of adjunctions

$$
  \array{
    && d
    \\
    & \swarrow &\downarrow& \searrow
    \\
    R(a) &\stackrel{R \bar f}{\leftarrow}& R L (d)& \stackrel{R(\bar g)}{\to} & R(b)
  }
  \,.

  \left(
    \array{
       a
       \\
       \downarrow & \searrow
       \\
       c &\longrightarrow & p  
       \\

+-- {: .num_remark #FiberProductsInASliceCategory}
###### Remark

By the characterization ([here](overcategory#LimitsInSliceViaLimitsOfCoconedDiagram)) of limits in a [[slice category]], this implies that [[fiber products]] in a [[slice category]] are computed as fiber products in the underlying category, or in other words that [[dependent sum]] to the point preserves fiber products.

\begin{example}\label{FirstPairOfFaceMapsFinalInOppositeSimplexCategory}
  For $\Delta^{op}$ the [[opposite category|opposite]] of the [[simplex category]], the non-full [[subcategory]] inclusion of the lowest two face maps
  $$
    \big(
      [1]
      \underoverset
        {d_0}
        {d_1}
        {\rightrightarrows}          
      [0]
    \big)
    \;\xrightarrow{\;\;\;\;}\;
    \Delta^{op}
  $$
  is a final functor.

  It follows that the [[colimit]] over a [[simplicial diagram]] is equivalently the [[coequalizer]] of the lowest two face maps.
