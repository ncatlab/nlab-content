## Definition

Given a [[field]] $k$, the $n$-th __Weyl algebra__ $A_{n,k}$ is an [[associative unital algebra]] over $k$ generated by the symbols $x^1,\ldots,x^n,\partial_1,\ldots,\partial_n$ modulo relations $x^i x^j = x^j x^i$, $\partial_i\partial_j = \partial_j\partial_i$ and $\partial_i x^j - x^j \partial_i = \delta_i^j$ (the [[Kronecker delta]]). 

In [[characteristic]] zero, it agrees with the algebra of [[regular differential operators]] on the $n$-dimensional [[affine space]]. 

Sometimes one considers the Weyl algebras over an arbitrary $k$-algebra $R$, including noncommutative $R$, when the definition is simply $A_{n,k}\otimes_k R$. Another generalization are the symplectic Weyl algebras. 

In [[quantum physics]], one often studies Weyl algebras over the [[complex numbers]]; the usual notation there is $p_j$ for $- \mathrm{i} \partial_j$ (where $\mathrm{i}$ is the imaginary unit).

Please distinguish from _[[Weil algebra]]_.  

## Properties

### Relation to Heisenberg Lie algebra

The Weyl algebra on $2n$ generators is the quotient of the [[universal enveloping algebra]] of the [[Heisenberg Lie algebra]] on $2n$ generators, obtained by identifying the [[center|central]] elements of the Heisenberg Lie algebra with multiples of the identity element.
