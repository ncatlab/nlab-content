Stone duality is a subject comprising various [[dualities]] between [[space and quantity]].

Perhaps the most generality duality falling under this heading is that between [[locales]] (on the [[space]] side) and [[frames]] (on the [[quantity]] side).  Of course, this duality is not very deep at all; the category [[Loc]] of locales is simply *defined* to be the [[opposite category|opposite]] of the category [[Frm]] of frames.  But there are several interesting dualities between [[subcategories]] of these.

The duality which is due to [[Marshall Stone]] and gives its name to the subject is that between [[Stone space]]s and [[Boolean algebras]].

Stone duality is often given for [[topological spaces]] rather than for [[locales]].  In this case, the most general duality is that between [[sober spaces]] and frames with enough points (which correspond to [[topological locale]]s).  In many cases, one requires the [[ultrafilter theorem]] (or other forms of the [[axiom of choice]]) in order for the duality to hold when applied to topological spaces, while the duality holds for locales even in [[constructive mathematics]].

[[Peter Johnstone]]\'s book _[[Stone Spaces]]_ is all about Stone duality.
