This page collects material related to 

* [[Hermann Grassmann]],

  _Die Wissenschaft der extensive Gr&#246;ssen oder die Ausdehnungslehre_

    _Erster Teil, die lineale Ausdehnungslehre_,

  1844

  ([pdf scan of original](http://www.uni-potsdam.de/u/philosophie/grassmann/Werke/Hermann/Ausdehnungslehre_1844.pdf))

which introduced for the first time basic concepts of what today is known as [[linear algebra]] and introduced in addition an _exterior product_ on vectors, forming what today is known as _[[exterior algebra]]_ or _[[Grassmann algebra]]_.

Grassmann advertizes his work (p. xxv) as being the theory of _[[extensive quantity]]_.

Discussion of the book includes

* {#Lawvere95} [[William Lawvere]], _A new branch of mathematics, "The Ausdehnungslehre of 1844," and other works. Open Court (1995), Translated by Lloyd C. Kannenberg, with foreword by Albert C. Lewis_, _Historia Mathematica Volume 32, Issue 1, February 2005, Pages 99&#8211;106_ ([publisher](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S031508600400059X))

which says at one point

> The modern conceptual apparatus, involving levels of structure, [[categories]] of [[morphisms]] preserving given [[structure]], [[forgetful functor|forgetful reduct functors]] between categories, the [[adjoints]] to such functors, etc., seems to be necessary for ordinary mortals to be able to find their way through the riches of Grassmann's geometry.
