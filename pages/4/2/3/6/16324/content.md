* {#Grassmann44} [[Hermann Grassmann]],

  _Die Wissenschaft der extensiven Gr&#246;ssen oder die Ausdehnungslehre_

    _Erster Teil, die lineale Ausdehnungslehre_,

  1844

  ([pdf scan of original](http://www.uni-potsdam.de/u/philosophie/grassmann/Werke/Hermann/Ausdehnungslehre_1844.pdf), [Internet Archive copy](https://archive.org/details/dielinealeausde00grasgoog/page/n11))

which introduced for the first time basic concepts of what today is known as [[linear algebra]] (including [[affine spaces]] as [[torsors]] over [[vector spaces]]) and introduced in addition an _exterior product_ (&#167;37, &#167;55) on [[vectors]], forming what today is known as _[[exterior algebra]]_ or _[[Grassmann algebra]]_, hence in fact _[[superalgebra]]_ (see [below](#SupercommutativeSuperalgebra)).


Grassmann advertizes his work (p. xxv) as being the theory of _[[extensive quantity]]_. The modern way of speaking about this is that the elements of the [[exterior algebra]] he considered are [[differential forms]] on [[Euclidean space]].

## Reception
 {#Reception}

The appreciation of Grassmann's ideas took a long time:

From [Drew Armstrong](https://plus.google.com/103061162497127117651/posts/f4HHK1XhUL1):

> Perhaps owing to the abstraction of his work, he was not recognized by the mathematical community and was more famous during his lifetime for his work in philology (including a translation of the Rig Veda). Despite his failure to achieve mathematical success, Grassmann never doubted that his work was significant. Here's a striking quote from the preface of the 1862 second edition of the _[[Ausdehnungslehre]]_:

>> {#CompletelyConvinced} I remain completely confident that the labour I have expended on the science presented here and which has demanded a significant part of my life as well as the most strenuous application of my powers, will not be lost. It is true that I am aware that the form which I have given the science is imperfect and must be imperfect. But I know and feel obliged to state (though I run the risk of seeming arrogant) that even if this work should again remain unused for another seventeen years or even longer, without entering into the actual development of science, still that time will come when it will be brought forth from the dust of oblivion and when ideas now dormant will bring forth fruit. I know that if I also fail to gather around me (as I have until now desired in vain) a circle of scholars, whom I could fructify with these ideas, and whom I could stimulate to develop and enrich them further, yet there will come a time when these ideas, perhaps in a new form, will arise anew and will enter into a living communication with contemporary developments. For truth is eternal and divine.

> (Translation from Michael Crowe, _A History of Vector Analysis_)

{#WhyNoOneHasTranslated} Here is R. W. Genese in 1893 ([Nature volume 48, page 517 ](https://www.nature.com/articles/048517a0)) lamenting the delay in its translation:

>  Sir Robert Ball asks why no one has translated the "[[Ausdehnungslehre]]" into English. The answer is as regretable as simple—it would not pay. The number of mathematicians who, after the severe courses of the universities, desire to extend their reading is very small. It is something that a respectable few seek to apply what they have already learnt. The first duty of those who direct the studies of the universities is to provide that students may leave in possession of all the best means of future investigation. That fifty years after publication the principles of the "[[Ausdehnungslehre]]" should find no place in English mathematical education is indeed astonishing. Half the time given to such a wearisome subject as Lunar Theory would place a student in possession of many of the delightful surprises of Grassmann's work, and set him thinking for himself. The "[[Ausdehnungslehre]]" has won the admiration of too many distinguished mathematicians to remain longer ignored. Clifford said of it: "I may, perhaps, be permitted to express my profound admiration of that extraordinary work, and my conviction that its principles will exercise a vast influence upon the future of mathematical science.” Useful or not, the work is “a thing of beauty," and no mathematician of taste should pass it by. It is possible, nay, even likely, that its principles may be taught more simply; but the work should be preserved as a classic.


Grassmann's ideas were finally studied in

* Hermann Hankel, _Vorlesungen über die Complexen Zahlen und ihre Functionen_, Leipzig: Leopold Voss, 1867. 

His ideas were developed by [[William Kingdon Clifford]] who turned Grassmann algebras into _[[Clifford algebras]]_ in 

* [[William Clifford]], _Applications of Grassmann's extensive algebra_, American Journal of Mathematics 1 (4): 350&#8211;358. (1878). doi:[10.2307/2369379](https://doi.org/10.2307/2369379). 

Today [[Grassmann algebra]] is ubiquituous in [[differential geometry]] ([[de Rham algebra]], [[supergeometry]]) and [[superalgebra]]. In fact, Grassmann had invented the [[signs in supergeometry|sign rule]] of [[supercommutative superalgebra]], which was fully appreciated only in the second half of the 20th century.

This way Grassmann's prediction on the eventual impact of his work did become true. From [[Freeman Dyson]], _Missed opportunities_ ([doi:10.1090/S0002-9904-1972-12971-9](https://doi.org/10.1090/S0002-9904-1972-12971-9)):

> In  the  year  1844 two  remarkable  events  occurred,  the  publication  by   Hamilton of  his  discovery  of  [[quaternions]],  and  the  publication  by Grassmann of  his  "[[Ausdehnungslehre]]."  With  the  advantage  of  hindsight  we  can  see  that  Grassmann's  was  the  greater  contribution  to   mathematics,  containing  the  germ  of  many  of  the  concepts  of  modern algebra,  and  including  vector  analysis  as a  special  case. However, Grassmann  was an  obscure  high-school  teacher  in Stettin, while Hamilton  was the  world-famous  mathematician  whose  official  titles  occupy  six  lines  of  print  after  his name at the beginning  of his 1844 paper.  So it  is regrettable,  but  not surprising,  that  quaternions  were  hailed  as  a  great  discovery, while Grassmann  had  to  wait  23  years  before  his  work  received  any recognition  at  all  from  professional  mathematicians.  When  Grassmann's  work  finally became  known,  mathematicians  were  divided  into  quaternionists and antiquaternionists, and  were spending more energy in polemical arguments  for  and  against  quaternions  than  in  trying  to  understand how  Grassmann  and  Hamilton  might  be  fitted  together  into  a  larger scheme  of  things.


Grassmann also had a profound influence on the thought of [[Gottlob Frege]]. See Sec. 2.1.1 of

## Discussion

Discussion of the book includes

* {#Lawvere96} [[William Lawvere]], _Grassmann's Dialectics and Category Theory_, in _Hermann G&#252;nther Gra&#223;mann (1809&#8211;1877): Visionary Mathematician, Scientist and Neohumanist Scholar_, Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science Volume 187, 1996, pp 255-264, doi:[10.1007/978-94-015-8753-2_21](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-015-8753-2_21)

and the similar text

* {#Lawvere95} [[William Lawvere]], _A new branch of mathematics, "The Ausdehnungslehre of 1844," and other works. Open Court (1995), Translated by Lloyd C. Kannenberg, with foreword by Albert C. Lewis_, _Historia Mathematica Volume 32, Issue 1, February 2005, Pages 99&#8211;106_, doi:[10.1016/j.hm.2004.07.004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hm.2004.07.004)

which says at one point that full appreciation of the _Ausdehnungslehre_ requires concepts of [[category theory]]

> The modern conceptual apparatus, involving levels of structure, [[categories]] of [[morphisms]] preserving given [[structure]], [[forgetful functor|forgetful reduct functors]] between categories, the [[adjoints]] to such functors, etc., seems to be necessary for ordinary mortals to be able to find their way through the riches of Grassmann's geometry.

The first part of the introduction of the _Ausdehnungslehre_ is concerned with [[philosophy]], about which 

> Grassmann insists that his reason for including it is an attempt to provide an orientation to help the student form for himself the proper estimation of the relation between general and particular at every stage of the learning process ([Lawvere 95](#Lawvere95)).

The second part of the introduction, titled _Survey of the general theory of forms_ considers key concepts of [[algebra]]. For instance it considers the [[associativity law]] and states its [[coherence law]] (&#167;3). 

Grassmann writes that he uses the term "form" in place of "quantity" (German: "Gr&#246;sse") (Introduction A.3, &#167;2). It is "forms" that his algebraic operations are defined on, and which are produced by these.

> The last half of that introduction is essentially one of the first expositions of the rudimentary principles of what today might be called [[universal algebra]]. The content of the first half, after considerable study of the compact formulations, appears to be a simple and clear natural scientist's version of the basic principles of dialectical materialism, as applied to the formal sciences. ([Lawvere 95](#Lawvere95))

Curiously, while Grassmann complains (on p. xv) about the "unclarity and arbitrariness" of [[Hegel]]'s school of philosophy ([[German idealism]], predominant in Germany at Grassmann's time), the introduction of the _Ausdehnungslehre_ has much the same sound as Hegel, notably it discusses "[[category (philosophy)|categories]]" such as _[[being]]_, _[[becoming]]_ (p. xxii), _[[concrete particular|particulars]]_ (p.xx) and the [[dialectic]] of [[unities of opposites|opposites]] such as _[[flat modality|discrete]] $\dashv$ [[sharp modality|continuous]]_ (p.xxii) and, notably, of _[[intensive and extensive quantity]]_ (p. xxiv-xxv), which Grassmann advertizes as the very topic of his mathematical theory. That of course is the difference to [[Hegel]], that unambiguous mathematical formalization of these otherwise vague concepts is provided (according to [Lawvere 95](#Lawvere95) Grassmannn's formalization of the pair _[[being]]_ and _[[becoming]]_ is via points and [[vectors]] in an [[affine space]]), and in this sense Grassmann is clearly a forerunner of Lawvere's various proposals for formalizing Hegel's [[objective logic]] in [[categorical logic]]/[[topos theory]] (as discussed at _[[Science of Logic]]_).
