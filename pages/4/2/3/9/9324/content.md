## Definition

In the sense of [Lurie, 2.1.2](#Lurie)

For $\mathcal{A}^\otimes, \mathcal{B}^\otimes$ two [[(∞,1)-operads]] regarded as their [[(∞,1)-categories of operators]] regarded as [[quasi-categories]], a [[homomorphism]] between them is a map in the [[slice category]] of [[sSet]] over $N(FinSet_*)$ such that it respects inert morphisms.
