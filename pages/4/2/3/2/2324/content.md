[[!redirects affine schemes]]

An _affine scheme_ is a [[scheme]] that as a [[sheaf]] on the [[opposite category]] [[CRing]]${}^{op}$ of commutative [[ring]]s (maybe finitely presented one) is [[representable functor|representable]]. In a [[ringed space]] picture an affine scheme is a [[locally ringed space]] which is locally isomorphic to the prime spectrum of a commutative ring.
