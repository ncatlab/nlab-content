#Definition

In any category, a **cospan** is a diagram like this:
$$
  \array{
     && a &&&& b
      \\
      & 
      && {}_{f}\searrow
       &
       & \swarrow_g
      && 
     \\
     
     &&&&
     c
     &&&&
  }
$$
A cospan in the category $C$ is the same as a [[span]] in the [[opposite category]] $C^{op}$.  So, all general facts about cospans in $C$ are general facts about spans in $C^{op}$, and the reader may turn to the entry on [[span|spans]] to learn more.
