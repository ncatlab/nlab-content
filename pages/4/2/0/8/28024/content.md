 {#PCTQuantumSymmetries}

We discuss how [[PCT symmetry|PCT]] [[quantum symmetries]] (Def. \ref{PCTQuantumSymmetry} below) are classified (Prop. \ref{ClassificationOfPCTQuantumSymmetries} below) by a "[[10-fold way]]" (Cor. \ref{TenFoldWayOfPCTQuantumSymmetries} below).

The definition and the argument is quite straightforward. Just for completeness we offer some *[Preliminaries](#PreliminariesForPCTQuantumSymmetries)*, but the reader may want to skip right ahead to the *[Definition and Classification](#PCTQuantumSymmetryDefinitionAndClassification)*.

The 10-fold classification of these PCT quantum symmetries immediately induces other incarnations of the [[10-fold way]], notably:

* the classification of flavors of [[topological K-theory]] ([[KU-theory]], [[KO-theory]], hence [[KR-theory]] in any degree)

  (by the [[Atiyah-Jänich theorem]] [in terms of graded Fredholm operators](Atiyah-Jänich+theorem#SummaryInTermsOfGradedFredholmOperators), see there) 

and with that 

* the 10-fold way in the [[K-theory classification of topological phases of matter]].



#### Preliminaries
 {#PreliminariesForPCTQuantumSymmetries}

Let:

* $\mathscr{H}$ be a countably infinite-dimensional [[complex numbers|complex]] [[Hilbert space]],

* [[U(ℋ)|$\mathrm{U}(\mathscr{H})$]] denote its [[unitary group]],

* $T$ be a [[real structure]] on $\mathscr{H}$, hence a [[complex numbers|complex]] [[antilinear map|antilinear]] [[involution]],

* $C_2^{(t)} \coloneqq \{id, T\}$ denote the [[cyclic group of order 2|group generated]] by $T$.

Observe that the [[semidirect product]] of the [[unitary group]] with that generated by $T$ is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] the group consisting of [[unitary operators]] *and* [[anti-unitary operators]]:

\[
  \label{GroupOfUnitaryAndAntiUnitaryOperators}
  \begin{array}{ccc}
    \mathrm{U}(\mathscr{H})
    \rtimes 
    C_2^{(t)}
    &\overset{\sim}{\longrightarrow}&
    \mathrm{U}(\mathscr{H})
    \sqcup
    \mathrm{U}_{anti}(\mathscr{H})
    \\
    (U, id) &\mapsto& U
    \\
    (U, T) &\mapsto& U \circ T
    \mathrlap{\,.}
  \end{array}
\]

This relation passes to [[projective unitary groups]]:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    P \mathrm{U}(\mathscr{H})
    &\coloneqq\;
    \mathrm{U}(\mathscr{H})/\mathrm{U}(1)
    \\
    P \mathrm{U}_{anti}(\mathscr{H})
    &\coloneqq\;
    \mathrm{U}_{anti}(\mathscr{H})/\mathrm{U}(1)
  \end{aligned}
$$

in that we have an analogous [[isomorphism]]

$$
  \begin{array}{ccc}
    P \mathrm{U}(\mathscr{H})
    \rtimes 
    C_2^{(t)}
    &\overset{\sim}{\longrightarrow}&
    P\mathrm{U}(\mathscr{H})
    \sqcup
    P\mathrm{U}_{anti}(\mathscr{H})
    \\
    ([U], id) &\mapsto& [U]
    \\
    ([U], T) &\mapsto& [U \circ T]
    \mathrlap{\,.}
  \end{array}
$$

This group of *projective unitary/antiunitary operators* is the group of [[quantum symmetries]] as usually considered ([[Wigner's theorem]]).

We next enlarge this a little more to include what may be thought of as particle/antiparticle symmetry, often referred to as *charge conjugation* symmetry.

To that end, let

* $\mathscr{H}_{gr} \coloneqq \mathscr{H} \ominus \mathscr{H}$ denote the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded Hilbert space,

* $P$ the grading [[involution]] on $\mathscr{H}$:

  $$
    \begin{array}{ccc}
      \mathscr{H} 
        &\overset{P}{\longrightarrow}&
      \mathscr{H}
      \\
      \left(
        \begin{matrix}
          \psi_+
          \\
          \psi_-
        \end{matrix}
      \right)
      &\mapsto&
      \left(
        \begin{matrix}
          \psi_-
          \\
          \psi_+
        \end{matrix}
      \right)
    \end{array}
  $$

* $C_2^{(p)} \coloneqq \{id, P\}$ denote the group generated by $P$,

* $C_2^{(c)} \coloneqq \{id, C \coloneqq P T\}$ denote the group generated by $P \circ T$,

* $\mathrm{U}_{gr}(\mathscr{H}_{gr}) \coloneqq \mathrm{U}(\mathscr{H})^2 \rtimes C_2^{(p)}$ denote the [[semidirect product]] which is isomorphic to the subgroup of $\mathrm{U}(\mathscr{H}_{gr})$ on the operators which are of homogeneous degree (either even or odd),

* $P\mathrm{U}_{gr}(\mathscr{H}_{gr}) \coloneqq \frac{\mathrm{U}(\mathscr{H})^2}{\mathrm{U}(1)} \rtimes C_2^{(p)}$ denote the corresponding projective group

Finally, combine all this to consider the following:



#### Definition and Classification
 {#PCTQuantumSymmetryDefinitionAndClassification}

\begin{definition}
The group of *graded quantum symmetries* is the [[semidirect product]]

\[
  \label{GradedQuantumSymmetries}
  QS 
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \frac{
    \mathrm{U}(\mathscr{H})^2
  }{
    \mathrm{U}(1)
  }
  \rtimes
  \big(
    C_2^{(t)} \times C_2^{(c)}
  \big)
  \mathrlap{\,,}
\]  

of the even graded projective unitary group with the operations of degree involution $P$ and complex involution $T$.
\end{definition}

This is a [[group extension]] 

$$
  \tfrac{
    \mathrm{U}(\mathscr{H})^2
  }{
    \mathrm{U}(1)
  }
  \hookrightarrow
  QS
  \twoheadrightarrow
  C_2^{(t)} \times C_2^{(c)}
$$

of

\[
  \label{PCTgroup}
  C_2^{(t)} \times C_2^{(c)}
  \;=\;
  \big\{
    id, T, C, P \coloneqq C T
  \big\}
  \,,
\]

which we may call the group of *[[PCT symmetries]]*.

\begin{definition}
\label{PCTQuantumSymmetry}
  A *PCT quantum symmetry* is a [[lift]] of a [[subgroup]]  of PCT symmetries (eq:PCTgroup) to a quantum symmetry (eq:GradedQuantumSymmetries), hence a dashed [[group homomorphism]] making the following [[diagram]] [[commuting diagram|commute]]:

\begin{tikzcd}
  G 
  \ar[
    dr,
    hook'
  ]
  \ar[
    rr, 
    dashed,
    "{ \big[ \widehat{(-)} \big] }"
  ]
  &&
  \mathrm{QS}
  \ar[
    dl,
    ->>
  ]
  \\
  & 
  C_2^{(t)}
  \times
  C_2^{(c)}
  \mathrlap{\,,}
\end{tikzcd}

where for $g \in G$ we denote by
\[
  \label{RepresentativeOfPCTQuantumSymmetry}
  \widehat{g}
  \;\in\;
  \mathrm{U}(\mathscr{H})^2 
  \rtimes
  \big(
    C_2^{(t)}
    \times
    C_2^{(c)}
  \big)
\]
a representative of the $\mathrm{U}(1)$-[[coset]] [[equivalence class]] $\big[\widehat{g}\big]$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
\label{ClassificationOfPCTQuantumSymmetries}
Given a PCT quantum symmetry $\widehat{G}$ (Def. \ref{PCTQuantumSymmetry}), we have

1. if $G = C_2^{(p)} = \big\{id, P = C T\big\}$, then $\big[\widehat{P}\big]$ has a representative $\widehat{P}$ (eq:RepresentativeOfPCTQuantumSymmetry) such that

   $$
     \widehat{P}{}^2 = id
     \mathrlap{\,,}
   $$

1. if $T \in G$ then $\big[\widehat{T}\big]$ has a representative $\widehat{T}$ (eq:RepresentativeOfPCTQuantumSymmetry) such that 

   $$
     \widehat{T}{}^2 \in \{\pm id\}
     \mathrlap{\,,}
   $$

1. if $C \in G$ then $\big[\widehat{C}\big]$ has a representative $\widehat{C}$ (eq:RepresentativeOfPCTQuantumSymmetry) such that 

   $$
     \widehat{C}{}^2 \in \{\pm id\}
     \mathrlap{\,,}
   $$

and all these cases occur.

\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}

1. That $\big[\widehat{(-)}\big]$ is a [[group homomorphism]] means equivalently that

   $$
     \begin{aligned}
       & \big[\widehat{P}\big]^2 \;=\; id
       \\
       \Leftrightarrow
       \;\;
       & 
       \widehat{P}^2 \;=\; \omega\, id
       \;\;\;
       \text{for some}
       \;
       \omega \in \mathrm{U}(1)
       \,.
     \end{aligned}
   $$

   But since for $G = C_2^{(p)}$ the operator $\widehat{P}$ must be unitary according to (eq:GroupOfUnitaryAndAntiUnitaryOperators) and hence in particular complex-linear, its rescaling by any [[square root]] $\sqrt{\omega} \in \mathrm{U}(1)$ yields an alternative representative

   $$
     \big[ \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{\omega}} \widehat{P} \big]
     \;=\;
     \big[ \widehat{P} \big]
   $$

   with the desired property:

   $$
     \begin{aligned}
     \big( \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{\omega}} \widehat{P} \big)^2
     & =
     \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{\omega}} \widehat{P}
     \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{\omega}} \widehat{P}
     \\
     & =
     \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{\omega}} 
     \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{\omega}} 
     \widehat{P}
     \widehat{P}
     \\
     & =
     id
     \mathrlap{\,.}
     \end{aligned}
   $$

1. Group homomorphy again requires that
   $$
     \begin{aligned}
       & \big[\widehat{T}\big]^2 \;=\; id
       \\
       \Leftrightarrow
       \;\;
       & 
       \widehat{T}^2 \;=\; \omega\, id
       \;\;\;
       \text{for some}
       \;
       \omega \in \mathrm{U}(1)
       \,,
     \end{aligned}
   $$

   but now that $\widehat{T}$ is [[anti-unitary operator|anti-unitary]] and hence in particular complex-[[anti-linear map|antilinear]], there is first all a further constraint, namely 

   $$
     \begin{aligned}
     &
     \widehat{T} \widehat{T}^2 = \widehat{T}^2 \widehatT
     \\
     \Rightarrow\;\;
     &
     \omega^\ast \widehat{T} = \omega \widehat{T}
     \\
     \Leftrightarrow\;\;
     &
     \omega^\ast = \omega 
     \\
     \Leftrightarrow\;\;
     &
     \omega \,\in\, \mathrm{U}(1) \cap \mathbb{R}
     \\
     \Leftrightarrow\;\;
     &
     \omega \,\in\, \{\pm 1\}
     \mathrlap{\,.}
     \end{aligned}
   $$

   On the other hand, for the same reason the single non-trivial value for $\omega$ may no longer be scaled away as before, since now

   $$
     \begin{aligned}
     \big( \pm \mathrm{i} \widehat{T} \big)^2
     & =
     (\pm\mathrm{i})\widehat{T}
     (\pm\mathrm{i})\widehat{T}
     \\
     & =
     (\pm\mathrm{i})(\mp\mathrm{i})\widehat{T}\widehat{T}
     \\
     & =
     \widehat{T}^2
     \mathrlap{\,.}
     \end{aligned}
   $$

3. Same argument as in (2.).

\end{proof}


\begin{corollary}
\label{TenFoldWayOfPCTQuantumSymmetries}
**([[10-fold way]] of PCT quantum symmetries)**
\linebreak
  The set of *PCT quantum symmetries* (Def. \ref{PCTQuantumSymmetry}) falls, by Prop. \ref{ClassificationOfPCTQuantumSymmetries}, into ten classes, according to the following table:

\begin{imagefromfile}
    "file_name": "PCTquantumSymmetries-251106.png",
    "width": 800,
    "unit": "px",
    "margin": {

\end{imagefromfile}

\end{corollary}

\begin{remark}
The labels in the last row of the table in Cor. \ref{TenFoldWayOfPCTQuantumSymmetries} are traditional --- early appearance in [Schnyder, Ryu, Furusaki & Ludwig 2008 table 1](ten-fold+way#SchnyderRyuFurusakiLudwig2008) (where, beware, the labels "DII" and "CII" are swapped with regards to the modern convention), reviewed in [Chiu, Teo, Schnyder & Ryu 2016](ten-fold+way#ChiuTeoSchnyderRyu2016)), with historical origin in [Cartan's 1926](symmetric+space#Cartan1926) classification of [[symmetric spaces]] in terms of [[simple Lie algebras]] (see [there](simple+Lie+algebra#Classification)).
