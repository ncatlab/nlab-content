## Definition

For a [[finite set]] $X$, a _cyclic permutation_ on $X$ is a [[permutation]] $\sigma \colon X \to X$ such that the induced [[group homomorphism]] $\mathbb{Z} \to Aut(X)$ from the [[integers]] to the [[automorphism group]]  (i.e. the [[symmetric group]]) of $X$, sending $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ to $\sigma^n$, defines a [[transitive action]]. 

One may visualize the elements of $X$ as points arranged on a [[circle]] spaced equally apart, with $\sigma(x)$ the next-door neighbor of $x$ in the counterclockwise direction, hence the name. 

See also [[rotation permutation]].
