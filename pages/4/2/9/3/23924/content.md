## Definition ##

Let $\mathcal{P}$ be a [[regular polygon]] in an [[Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$, and let $\mathcal{E}$ be the [[subset]] of all [[points]] in $\mathbb{R}^n$ that is [[distance|equidistant]] from all [[vertices]] of the regular polygon. 

The **center** of the regular polygon $\mathcal{P}$ is the unique point $p \in \mathcal{E}$ such that for any other point $q \in \mathcal{E}$, the distance from $p$ to a vertex of the polygon is less than or equal to the distance from $q$ to the same vertex of the polygon. The distance from the center of the regular polygon to a vertex of a regular polygon is called the **circumradius** of the regular polygon.
