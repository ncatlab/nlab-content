__Calkin algebra__ is the quotient of the algebra of bounded linear operators on an infinite-dimensional separable complex [[Hilbert space]] by the subalgebra of [[compact operator]]s. 
It is widely used in [[index theory]] and [[operator algebras]]. 

It is sometimes viewed as a noncommutative analogue of the space of continuous functions on $\beta(\omega) \,\backslash\, \omega$ (where $\beta$ means taking the [[Stone-âˆžech compactification]]).

Some results invoking the Calkin algebra rely on extra axioms in [[set theory]]:

[[Todorcevic's Axiom]] (TA, also called the Open Coloring Axiom) implies that all automorphisms of the Calkin algebra are inner ([Farah 2011a](#Farah11a)), whereas assuming the [[continuum hypothesis]], one can construct an outer automorphism ([Phillips-Weaver 2007](#PhillipsWeaver)). Note that TA contradicts CH (see [this blog post](http://blog.assafrinot.com/?p=3243)), so these two options are mutually exclusive.

There are also some analogues of the above results where the separable Hilbert space is replaced by an arbitrary Hilbert space. For instance, the [[Proper Forcing Axiom]] (PFA) implies that for every Calkin algebra, all automorphisms are inner ([Farah 2011b](#Farah11b)).
