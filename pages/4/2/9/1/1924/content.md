__Calkin algebra__ is the quotient of the algebra of bounded linear operators on an infinite-dimensional separable complex [[Hilbert space]] by the subalgebra of [[compact operator]].s 
It is widely used in [[index theory]] and [[operator algebras]]. 

It is sometimes viewed as a noncommutative analogue of the space of continuous functions on $\beta\omega \,\backslash\, \omega$ (where $\beta$ means taking the [[Stone-∞ech compactification]]).

Some results invoking the Calkin algebra rely on extra axioms in [[set theory]]:
