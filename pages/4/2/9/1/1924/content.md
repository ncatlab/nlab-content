## Idea

The __Calkin algebra__ is the [[quotient]] $B(H)/K(H)$ of the [[C*-algebra]] of [[bounded operator|bounded]] [[linear operators]] on an infinite-dimensional separable complex [[Hilbert space]] $H$ by the closed ideal of [[compact operators]].
It is widely used in [[index theory]] and [[operator algebras]]. 

It is sometimes viewed as a noncommutative analogue of the space of continuous functions on $\beta(\omega) \,\backslash\, \omega$ (where $\beta$ means taking the [[Stone-Čech compactification]]).

## Properties

### General

Some results invoking the Calkin algebra rely on extra [[axioms]] in [[set theory]], see for instance ([Weaver 2007](#Weaver)) for a sample of such results. 

### Automorphisms

[[Todorcevic's Axiom]] (TA, also called the _Open Coloring Axiom_) implies that all [[automorphisms]] of the Calkin algebra are [[inner automorphism|inner]] ([Farah 2011a](#Farah11a)), whereas assuming the [[continuum hypothesis]], one can construct an [[outer automorphism]] ([Phillips-Weaver 2007](#PhillipsWeaver)). Note that TA contradicts CH ([Rinot 2013](#Rinot13)), so these two options are mutually exclusive.

There are also some analogues of the above results where the separable Hilbert space is replaced by an arbitrary infinite-dimensional complex Hilbert space. For instance, the [[Proper Forcing Axiom]] (PFA) implies that for every Calkin algebra, all automorphisms are inner ([Farah 2011b](#Farah11b)).

Another result ([Farah and Hirshberg 2016](#FarahHirshberg16)) of Farah and Hirshberg states that the Calkin algebra of a separable Hilbert space is not countably [[homogeneous structure|homogeneous]]; in particular, it cannot be realized as a [[Fraïssé limit]] of [[continuous logic|metric structures]].
