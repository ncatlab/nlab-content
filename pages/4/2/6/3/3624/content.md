The Hilbert cube is the topological product 

$$\prod_n [0,\frac{1}{n}]$$

It is a compact metric space.  It is variously denoted by $Q$ or $I^\omega$.

It plays a central role in [[Borsuk's shape theory]], and is the basis for the construction of Hilbert cube manifolds.  The theory of these were developed by Tom Chapman (mid 1970s) and were used in his proof of the topological invariance of Whitehead torsion.
