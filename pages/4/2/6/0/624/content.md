An object $a$ in a [[monoidal category]] $C$ is **dualizable** if it has an [[adjunction|adjoint]] when regarded as a 1-cell in the one-object [[bicategory]] $B C$ corresponding to $C$.  If $C$ is [[braided monoidal category|braided]] then left and right adjoints are equivalent; otherwise one speaks of $a$ being **left dualizable** or **right dualizable**.

Dualizable objects support a good abstract notion of [[trace]].
