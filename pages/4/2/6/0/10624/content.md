## Idea

**Algebraic effects** are computational [[side effect|effects]] that can be represented by an equational theory, or [[algebraic theory]], whose operations produce the effects at hand. 

They provide an alternative to using [[monads (in computer science)]] for modelling _effects_ with a [[functional programming language]]. This approach has been realized in the programming language [[Eff]].

[[continuation monad|Continuations]] are not algebraic effects.
