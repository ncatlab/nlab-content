## Idea

In [[physics]], an [[observable]] in the context of [[classical mechanics]]/[[classical field theory]] and in fact also in [[prequantum field theory]] is called a _classical observable_.

In [[symplectic geometry]]/[[geometric prequantum theory]], classical observables are [[functions]] on [[phase space]], often called [[Hamiltonian]] functions. They form the [[Poisson algebra]] of classical/prequantum observables, wih the [[Poisson bracket]] [[Lie algebra]] structure.

In [[higher prequantum field theory]] these observables are refined to [[Hamiltonian forms]]/[[local currents]] and form the [[Poisson-bracket Lie n-algebra of local observables]].
