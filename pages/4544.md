### In Abelian categories 

An object $X$ in an [[AB5-category]] $C$ is __of finite type__ if one of the following equivalent conditions hold:

(i) any complete directed set $\{X_i\}_{i\in I}$ of [[subobject]]s of $X$ is stationary

(ii) for any complete directed set $\{Y_i\}_{i\in I}$ of subobjects of an object $Y$ the natural morphism $colim_i C(X,Y_i) \to C(X,Y)$ is an isomorphism.

An object $X$ is __finitely presented__ if it is of finite type and if for any 
epimorphism $p:Y\to X$ where $Y$ is of finite type, it follows that $ker\,p$ is also of finite type. An object $X$ in an AB5 category is __coherent__ if it is of finite type and for any morphism $f: Y\to X$ of finite type $ker\,f$ is of finite type.

For an exact sequence $0\to X'\to X\to X''\to 0$ in an AB5 category the following hold:

(a) if $X'$ and $X''$ are finitely presented, then $X$ is finitely presented;

(b) if $X$ is finitely presented and $X'$ of finite type, then $X''$ is finitely presented;

(c) if $X$ is coherent and $X'$ of finite type then $X''$ is also coherent.

For a module $M$ over a ring $R$ this is equivalent to $M$ being finitely generated
$R$-module. It is finitely presented if it is finitely presented in the usual
sense of existence of short exact sequence of the form $R^I\to R^J\to M\to 0$
where $I$ and $J$ are finite. 

### In homotopical algebra

A _graded object_ is often said to be of **finite type** if it is _degreewise_ of finite [[dimension]]/[[rank]], in some sense.

The terminology is used specifically in [[rational homotopy theory]].

Notably a [[rational space]] is said to be of finite type if all its rational [[homotopy group]]s are finite dimensional [[vector space]]s over the [[rational number]]s.

Accordingly, [[chain complex]] of vector spaces, possibly that generating a [[semifree dga]] is said to be of finite type if it is degreewise finite dimensional.

Beware however that the terminology clashes with the use in [[homotopy theory]], there the concept of _[[finite homotopy type]]_ is crucially different from _[[homotopy type with finite homotopy groups]]_.
