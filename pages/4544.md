A _graded object_ is often said to be of **finite type** if it is _degreewise_ of finite [[dimension]]/[[rank]], in some sense.

The terminology is used specifically in [[rational homotopy theory]].

Notably a [[rational space]] is said to be of finite type if all its rational [[homotopy group]]s are finite dimensional [[vector space]]s over the [[rational number]]s.

Accordingly, [[chain complex]] of vector spaces, possibly that generating a [[semifree dga]] is said to be of finite type if it is degreewise finite dimensional.

Beware however that the terminology clashes with the use in [[homotopy theory]], there the concept of _[[finite homotopy type]]_ is crucially different from _[[homotopy type with finite homotopy groups]]_.
