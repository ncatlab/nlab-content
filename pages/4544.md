A _graded object_ is often said to be of **finite type** if it is degreewise finite dimensional, in some sense.

The terminology is used specifically in [[rational homotopy theory]].

Notably a [[rational space]] is said to be of finite type if all its rational [[homotopy group]]s are finite dimensional [[vector space]]s over the [[rational number]]s.

Accordingly, [[chain complex]] of vector spaces, possibly that generating a [[semifree dga]] is said to be of finite type if it is degreewise finite dimensional.
