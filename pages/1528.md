The classical  _Moore path category_ of a [[topological space]] $X$ is a variant on the usual space of paths $I \to X$, but one which yields a strict category. 

#Definition#

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]]. Its **Moore path category** $M(X)$ has

* $Obj(M(X)) = X$

* Its set of all morphisms consists of pairs $a=(f,r)$ where $f:[0, \infty) \to X$ is continuous, $r \geq 0$ and $f$ is constant on $[r, \infty)$. The source of $a$ is $f(0)$ and the target of $a$ is $f(r)$. The number may be called the _shape_ of $a$. We may compose $a=(f,r)$ and $b=(g,s)$ to obtain $a \circ b= (h,r+s)$ where $h(t)= f(t)$ for $ t \leq r$ and $h(t) = g(t-r)$ for $t \geq r$. Identities are paths of shape $0$. 

The advantage of this definition as pairs is partly in giving a topology on $M(X)$, but also  in iteration (see reference below).
