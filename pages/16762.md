## Idea

Given a [[space]] $X$ of sorts, in particular a [[scheme]] or [[variety]], with [[singularities]], i.e. with a subspace $S \subset X$ at which the [[geometry]] is non-regular (specifically: not [[smooth scheme|smooth]]), a _resolution_ of the singularity is a suitable regular (non-singular) space
$\widehat X$ equipped with a [[morphism]] back to the original space

$$
  p \;\colon\; \widehat X \longrightarrow X
$$

which is an [[isomorphism]] away from the singular locus.

Typical resolution of singularities is by "blow-up" of the singularity where the singular point is replaced by an  [[n-sphere]], then called the "exceptional divisor" of the blow-up.

(quick review of the basic details includes [Berghoff 14, section 4.1](#Berghoff14))



## Examples

* the [[Fulton-MacPherson compactification]] of [[configuration spaces of points]] may be regarded as resolution of the [[fat diagonal]] inside an iterated [[Cartesian product]];

* this generalizes to  "[[wonderful compactifications]]" resolving singularities given by more general subspace arrangements

* [[Bridgeland stability]] over resolution of [[ADE-singularities]]: see [there](Bridgeland+stability+condition#OverResolutionsOfADESingularities)

This method is closely related to the resolution of singularities of [[propagators]]/[[Feynman amplitudes]] by passage to [[Fulton-MacPherson compactification|compactified]] [[configuration spaces of points]], as disucussed at _[[Feynman amplitudes on compactified configuration spaces of points]]_.
