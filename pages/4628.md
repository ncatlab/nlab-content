## Idea

The _Freyd--Mitchell embedding theorem_ says that every [[abelian category]] is a [[full subcategory]] of a [[category of modules]] over some [[ring]] $R$ and that the embedding is an [[exact functor]].

## Details

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

It is easy to see that not every abelian category is _[[equivalence of categories|equivalent]]_ to $R$[[Mod]] for some [[ring]] $R$.  The reason is that $R Mod$ has all [[small category|small]] [[limits]] and [[colimits]].  But for instance the category of [[finitely generated module|finitely generated]] $R$-modules is an abelian category but lacks these properties.

However, we have

###### Mitchell's Embedding Theorem

Every [[small category|small]] [[abelian category]] admits a [[full functor|full]], [[faithful functor|faithful]] and [[exact functor|exact]] functor to the category $R$[[Mod]] for some [[ring]] $R$.

=--


This result can be found as Theorem 7.34 on page 150 of ([Freyd](#Freyd)).  (The terminology there is a bit outdated, in that it calls an abelian category "fully abelian" if it admits a full and faithful exact functor to a category of $R$-modules.)  A pedagogical discussion is in section 1.6 of ([Weibel](#Weibel)). See also ([Wikipedia](#Wikipedia)) for the idea of the proof.

+-- {: .proof #Proof}
###### Proof

(...)

We can also characterize which abelian categories _are_ equivalent to a category of $R$-modules:

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

Let $C$ be an [[abelian category]].  If $C$ has all [[small category|small]] [[coproducts]] and has a [[compact object|compact]] [[projective object|projective]] [[generator]], then $C \simeq R Mod$ for some ring $R$.  

In fact, in this situation we can take $R = C(x,x)^{op}$ where $x$ is any compact projective generator.   Conversely, if $C \simeq R Mod$, then $C$ has all small coproducts and $x = R$ is a compact projective generator.

=--

This theorem, minus the explicit description of $R$, can be found as Exercise F on page 103 of ([Freyd](#Freyd)).
The first part of this theorem can also be found as Prop. 2.1.7 in ([Ginzburg](#Ginzburg)).  Conversely, it is easy to see that $R$ is a compact projective generator of $R Mod$. 


Going further, we can try to characterize functors between categories of $R$-modules that come from tensoring with bimodules.  Here we have

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Watts' Theorem

If $B$ is an an $S$-$R$-bimodule, the [[tensor product]] functor

$$  
  B \otimes_R -\colon R Mod \to S Mod 
$$

is [[right exact functor|right exact]] and preserves [[small category|small]] [[coproducts]].  Conversely, if $F\colon Mod_R \to Mod_S$ is right exact and that preserves small coproducts, it is naturally isomorphic to $B \otimes_R -$ where $B$ is the $S$-$R$-bimodule $F R$.  

=--


This theorem was more or less simultaneously proved by Watts and Eilenberg; a generalization is proved in ([Nyman-Smith](#NymanSmith)), and references to the original papers can be found there.


Going still further we should be able to obtain a nice theorem describing the [[image]] of the embedding of the [[2-category]] of

* rings
* bimodules
* bimodule homomorphisms

into the strict 2-category of 

* abelian categories
* right exact functors
* natural transformations.
