## Definition

Let $U: C\to D$ be a [[forgetful functor]] and $x\in D$ an [[object]] of the [[category]] $D$.  

A **free $C$-object** on $x$ with respect to $U$ is an [[object]] of $C$ that satisfies the [[universal property]] that $F(x)$ would have, if $F$ were a [[left adjoint]] to $U$ (the corresponding [[free functor]]) (the _[[free construction]]_ on $x$).  

If $U$ actually has a [[left adjoint]], then $F(x)$ is a free $C$-object on $x$ for every $x$, and conversely if there exists a free $C$-object on every $x\in D$ then $U$ has a left adjoint.  But individual free objects can exist without the whole left adjoint functor existing.  In general, we have a "partially defined adjoint", or $J$-[[relative adjoint]] where $J$ is the inclusion of a [[full subcategory]] (on those objects admitting free objects).

More precisely: a __free $C$-object on $x$__ consists of an object $y\in C$ together with a [[morphism]] $\eta_x \colon x\to U y$ in $D$ such that for any other $z\in C$ and morphism $f\colon x\to U z$ in $D$, there exists a unique $g\colon y\to z$ in $C$ with $U(g) \circ \eta_x = f$.  

In other words, it is an [[initial object]] of the [[comma category]] $(x/U)$.  A free $C$-object on $x$ is also sometimes called a **universal arrow** from $x$ to the functor $U$.  It can also be identified with a [[semi-final lift]] of an empty $U$-structured [[sink]].

Similarly, a __cofree object__ (or __fascist object__) is given by a [[cofree functor]].
