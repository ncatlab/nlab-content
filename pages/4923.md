## Idea

_Regular logic_ is the [[internal logic]] of [[regular categories]].  Its logical operations consist only of [[truth]], [[conjunction]], and [[existential quantification]], which makes it a superset of [[finite-limit logic]] and a subset of [[coherent logic]] and [[geometric logic]].


## References

The relation between regular categories and regular logic can be found spelled out for instance  in [section 3.4](http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~ooste110/syllabi/catsmoeder.pdf#page=34) of

* [[Jaap van Oosten]], _Basic category theory_ ([pdf](http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~ooste110/syllabi/catsmoeder.pdf)) 

and also in D1.2 of the [[Elephant]] (which places it in relation to the internal logics of other types of categories).
