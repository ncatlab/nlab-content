## Idea

In [[perturbative quantum field theory]] generally all [[quantum observables]] are subject to [[renormalization]] choices that may change their value from that computed in [[classical field theory]]. But if [[renormalization conditions]] are imposed, these generally reduce the space of renormalization choices. If a choice of [[renormalization condition]] completely removes the renormalization freedom in an observable, one says that it _protects_ the observable from _receiving quantum corrections_.

Typically this is considered for global [[symmetry of the Lagrangian|symmetries]], the [[renormalization condition]] being that the symmetry is retained after renormalization. In this case one says that that the _symmetry protects_ the quantum observable from receiving quantum corrections.

## Examples

Famous examples of protected quantities are [[masses]] and [[charges]] of [[BPS-states]], which are protected, in this way, by [[supersymmetry]]. The reason why supersymmetric field theory admits more interesting computations than are possible otherwise is that the protection of BPS states allows to compute many quantum observables that would otherwise not be computatble. 

This is for instance the reason why so much is known about the [[Bekenstein-Hawking entropy]] of extremal (hence [[BPS-state|BPS]]) [[black holes]] (see at _[[black holes in string theory]]_) while comparatively little is known about the quantum properties of non-BPS and hence "non-protected" black holes.
