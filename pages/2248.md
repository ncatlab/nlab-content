## Idea

Any commutative unital [[integral domain|domain]] can be embedded into a smallest [[field]] in a unique way, its [[field of fractions]]. For noncommutative domains, both the existence and uniqueness (of a smallest [[skew field]]) do not need to hold, and are difficult to decide.

A classical theorem guarantees the existence for a class of [[Ore domain]]s that is the domains for which the subset of regular elements is an [[Ore subset]]; then the corresponding [[Ore localization]] is a skewfield and the localization map is an injection. Another important case is the case of free [[associative algebras]]; in that case the solution is not unique and the first embedding was constructed by Amitsur, and by a different procedure by P. M. Cohn. This skewfield is called the __free field__. It has been more recently used in formulating the theory of [[quasideterminants]].

I\'ve moved this to simply [[free field]], on the grounds that (as with [[field]] itself) the algebraic mathematical meaning is likely to be our default here.  But I might be wrong.  ---Toby
