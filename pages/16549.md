## Idea

In a context of [[differential cohesion]], with [[infinitesimal shape modality]] $\Im$, then for every object $X \in \mathbf{H}$ its _infinitesimal disk bundle_ $T_{inf}X$ is the [[homotopy fiber product|homotopy]] [[fiber product]]

$$
  \array{
    T_{inf} X &\stackrel{ev}{\longrightarrow}& X
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}} && \downarrow
    \\
    X &\stackrel{i}{\longrightarrow}& \Im(X)
  }
$$

of the $X$ component $i \colon X \to \Im X$ of the [[unit of a monad|unit]]  of the $\Im$-[[monad]] with itself.


By the [[pasting law]], the [[fibers]] of $p \colon T_{inf}X \to X$ over [[global points]] of $X$ are indeed the [[infinitesimal disks]] around these points.

Evidently $T_{inf}X$ is the first stage in the [[Cech nerve]] of $X \to \Im(X)$, hence the object of morphisms of the [[groupoid object]] corresponding to this [[effective epimorphism]]. By the discussion at _[Lie algebroid -- General abstract definition](Lie+infinity-algebroid#GeneralAbstractDefinition)_ this is an [[infinity-Lie algebroid]], namely the (possibly higher jet order) [[tangent Lie algebroid]] of $X$.

More generally, for $(E \to X) \in \mathbf{H}_{/X}$ a [[bundle]] over $X$, then $T_{inf}E \coloneqq T_{inf} X \times_{\Im X} E \simeq X\times_{\Im X} E$, sitting in the [[pasting]] composite of pullbacks

$$
  \array{
    T_{inf} E &\longrightarrow& E
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    T_{inf} X &\stackrel{ev}{\longrightarrow}& X
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}} && \downarrow
    \\
    X &\stackrel{i}{\longrightarrow}& \Im(X)
  }
  \,.
$$

Stated more abstractly, this means that forming infinitesimal disk bundles is the [[monad]]

$$
  T_{inf} X \times_X (-)
  =
  i^\ast i_!
$$

induced by the [[adjoint triple]] of [[base change]] along $i$

$$
  (i_! \dashv i^\ast \dashv i_\ast)
  \;\colon\;
  \mathbf{H}_{/X}
   \stackrel{\overset{i_!}{\longrightarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{i^\ast}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{i_\ast}{\longrightarrow}}}
  \mathbf{H}_{/\Im X}
  \,.
$$

## Properties

### Relation to the formal neighbourhood of the diagonal 
 {#RelationToFormalNeighbourhoodOfTheDiagonal}

In the standard models of [[differential cohesion]] (such as for [[formal smooth infinity-groupoids]]), $\Im X$ is the standard [[de Rham stack]] of $X$ obtained by identifying infinitesimal neighbours, and so then $T_{\inf }X$ is the [[formal neighbourhood of the diagonal]] of $X$, in the traditional sense. Indeed, in these standard models $X \to \Im X$ is a [[1-epimorphism]], hence [[effective epimorphism|effective]], and so on 0-truncated $X$ the above pullback equivalently equibits the [[de Rham stack]] $\Im X$ for 0-truncated $X$ as the [[coequalizer]] of the two projections out of the formal neighbourhood of the diagoal, which is the traditional definition of $\Im X$.

### Relation to tangent complexes

The [[tangent complex]] of a [[derived stack|derived]] [[algebraic stack]] $X$ is equivalently the (sheaf of modules of) sections of the [[formal neighbourhood of the diagonal]] of $X$ ([Hennion 13](#Hennion13)). Hence by the [above](#RelationToFormalNeighbourhoodOfTheDiagonal) one may generally think of (sections of) $T_{inf}X$ as being the [[tangent complex]] of $X$.

### Relation to jet bundles

The infinitesimal disk bundle construction is [[left adjoint]] to the [[jet comonad]]

$$
  T_{inf} \dashv Jet
  \,.
$$

In the context of [[synthetic differential geometry]] this is ([Kock 80, prop. 2.2](#Kock80)). In terms of [[differential cohesion]] this is simply the adjoint pair induced by the [[base change]] [[adjoint triple]]

$$
  (i_! \dashv i^\ast \dashv i_\ast)
  \;\colon\;
  \mathbf{H}_{/X}
    \stackrel{\overset{i_!}{\longrightarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{i^\ast}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{i_\ast}{\longrightarrow}}}
  \mathbf{H}_{/\Im X}
  \,.
$$

### Relation to frame bundles

For $X$ a $V$-[[manifold]], then its infinitesimal disk bundle is a [[fiber bundle]] ([[fiber infinity-bundle]]) with typical fiber $\simeq \mathbb{D}^V_e$. This is the [[associated bundle]] ([[associated infinity-bundle]]) to the [[frame bundle]] $Fr(X) \to X$ (or more generally of the [[higher order frame bundle]] when $(\Re \dashv \Im)$ encodes higher order infinitesimal thickening).
