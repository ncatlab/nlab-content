## Idea

A [[dualizable object]] in a [[symmetric monoidal (∞,n)-category]] is called **fully dualizable** if the structure maps of the duality unit and counit each themselves have adjoints, which have adjoints, and so on.

## Properties

By the [[cobordism hypothesis]]-theorem, symmetric monoidal [[(∞,n)-functor]]s out of the [[(∞,n)-category of cobordisms]]s are characterized by their value on the point, which is a fully dualizable object.

## Examples

* In the [[symmetric monoidal category]] [[Vect]] of [[vector space]]s (over some [[field]]), the fully dualizable objects are the finite-[[dimension]]al vector spaces.

* In the [[symmetric monoidal (infinity,n)-category|symmetric monoidal (infinity,3)-category]] of [[monoidal categories]] and [[bimodule]] categories between them, the fully dualizable objects are (or at least contain) the [[fusion categories]]. See there for details.
