## Idea

A [[dualizable object]] in a [[symmetric monoidal (∞,n)-category]] $\mathcal{C}$ is called **fully dualizable** if the structure maps of the duality unit and counit each themselves have adjoints, which have adjoints, and so on, up to level $(n-1)$.


## Properties

By the [[cobordism hypothesis]]-theorem, symmetric monoidal [[(∞,n)-functor]]s out of the [[(∞,n)-category of cobordisms]] are characterized by their value on the point, which is a fully dualizable object.

## Examples

* In the [[symmetric monoidal category]] [[Vect]] of [[vector space]]s (over some [[field]]), the fully dualizable objects are the finite-[[dimension]]al vector spaces.

* In the [[2-category]] of [[associative algebras]]  with [[bimodules]] between them as morphisms, over a [[perfect field]], fully dualizable objects [[separable algebras]] which are a [[projective module]] over $k$ [SchommerPries 11, section 3.8.3](#SchommerPries11). 

* In the [[symmetric monoidal (infinity,n)-category|symmetric monoidal 3-category]] of [[monoidal categories]] and [[bimodule categories]] between them, the fully dualizable objects are (or at least contain) the [[fusion categories]]. ([DSPS 13](#DSPS13)).
