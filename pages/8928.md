## Black hole entropy

In ([[perturbative string theory|perturbative]]) [[string theory]] the [[Bekenstein-Hawking entropy]] associated to a macroscopic [[black hole]]  finds an explanation as follows:

the [[black hole]] [[spacetime]] is regarded as a strongly coupled condensate of strings (closed strings,, carrying [[gravity]]). One looks for a corresponding weakly-coupled background for closed strings in flat [[Minkowski space]] that is known to turn into the black hole spacetime as the string coupling is turned on. These are identified as certain [[D-brane]] configurations in Minkowski space: at weak coupling the D-brane does not back-react on the spacetime (since that back-reaction is mediated by closed string quanta) and so it just sits there, whereas at strong coupling it curves spacetime and may collaps to a configuration that looks like a prescribed black hole spacetime.

Now, if the configuration has a sufficient amount of [[supersymmetry]] preserved, then one knows that certain observables are actually independent of the coupling constant, and accordingly these observables are the same for black holes as for the corresponding D-brane configurations in flat space.

The best studied such configuration is one of bound [[D5-brane]]-[[D1-branes]]. For these configurations one may compute the number of quantum microstates of open strings attached to them, hence the corresponding [[entropy]]. By the above reasoning this may then be compared to the [[Bekenstein-Hawking entropy]] of the corresponding (supersymmetric) black hole. And indeed there results match.
