## Black hole entropy

In ([[perturbative string theory|perturbative]]) [[string theory]] the [[Bekenstein-Hawking entropy]] associated to a macroscopic [[black hole]]  finds an explanation as follows:

the [[black hole]] [[spacetime]] is regarded as a [[non-perturbative QFT|strongly coupled]] [[condensate]] of string states ([[closed strings]], carrying [[gravity]]). One looks for a corresponding weakly-coupled background for closed strings in flat [[Minkowski space]] that is known to turn into the black hole spacetime as the string coupling is turned on. Such turn out to be certain [[D-brane]] configurations in Minkowski space: at weak coupling the D-brane does not back-react on the spacetime (since that back-reaction is mediated by closed string quanta) and so it just sits there, whereas at strong coupling it curves spacetime and may collapse to a configuration that looks like the prescribed black hole spacetime.

Now, if the configuration has a sufficient amount of [[supersymmetry]] preserved, then one knows that certain observables are actually independent of the coupling constant ("protected"), and accordingly these observables are the same for black holes as for the corresponding D-brane configurations in flat space, where they may be computed in string perturbation theory.

The best studied such configuration is one of bound [[D5-brane]]-[[D1-branes]]. For these configurations one may compute the number of [[BPS states]] (which are "protected"), hence the  [[entropy]], via the [[Witten genus]] ([Strominger-Vafa 96](#StromingerVafa96)), see at _[Witten genus -- Relation to BPS state counting](Witten+genus#RelationToBPSStateCounting)_. By the above reasoning this may then be compared to the [[Bekenstein-Hawking entropy]] of the corresponding (supersymmetric) black hole. And indeed the results match the semiclassical BH-entropy to leading order and in addition provide their higher order quantum corrections. See the _[References](#References)_ below.
