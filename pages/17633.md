
Let $L$ be a [[set]] equipped with both a [[partial order]] $\leq$ (whose [[opposite relation|opposite]] is denoted $\geq$), an [[inequality]] $\ne$, and a [[basepoint]] $0$.  (In [[classical mathematics]], one usually uses the [[denial inequality]], but in [[constructive mathematics]], it\'s more important that $\ne$ is [[tight relation|tight]], and even this may not be possible.)  We write $\lt$ for the conjunction of $\leq$ and $\ne$ (and $\gt$ for its opposite, the conjunction of $\geq$ and $\ne$).

Following the terminology at [[inner product space]], an element $x$ of $L$ is:
