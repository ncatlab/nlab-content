## Idea

For every [[topological space]] $X$ there is a [[CW complex]] $Z$ and a [[weak homotopy equivalence]] $f  \colon Z\to X$. Such a map $f  \colon Z\to X$ is called a **CW approximation** to $X$.

Such CW-approximation may be constructed case-by-case by iteratively attaching (starting from the empty space) cells for each representative of a [[homotopy group]] of $X$ and further cells to kill off spurious homotopy groups introduced this way (e.g. [Hatcher, p. 352-353](#Hatcher)).

In the [[classical model structure on topological spaces]] $Top_{Quillen}$, the cofibrant objects are the [[retracts]] of [[cell complexes]], and hence CW approximations are in particular cofibrant replacements in this model structure.

The [[Quillen equivalence]] $Top_{Quillen} \stackrel{\overset{{\vert - \vert}}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{Sing}{\longrightarrow}} sSet_{Quillen}$ to the [[classical model structure on simplicial sets]] ("[[homotopy hypothesis]]") yields a _functorial_ CW approximation (by [this proposition](geometric+realization#mono)) via

$$
  X \mapsto {\vert Sing X\vert}
$$

([[geometric realization]] of the [[singular simplicial complex]] of $X$) with the [[adjunction counit]]

$$
  {\vert Sing X\vert}
  \overset{\in W}{\longrightarrow}
  X
$$

a weak homotopy equivalence.
