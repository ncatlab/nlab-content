## Idea 

A _path $n$-groupoid_  $P_n(X)$ of a smooth space (or [[generalized smooth space]]) $X$ is a [[diffeological n-groupoid]] which is

* a generalization of the [[path groupoid]] to higher categorical dimension 

* a truncation of sorts of an [[path ∞-groupoid]] of $X$.

Its [[k-morphisms|j-morphisms]] are given by (possibly equivalence classes of) $j$-dimensional smooth paths in $X$, i.e. usually smooth maps $\gamma : D^k \to X$. Composition is by gluing of such maps.

## Path 1-groupoid

See [[path groupoid]].

## Path 2-groupoid 

Definitions of path 2-groupoids as strict [[2-groupoids]] internal to [[diffeological spaces]] appear (at least) in

* [[John Baez]], [[Urs Schreiber]], _Higher gauge theory_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0511710))

* [[Urs Schreiber]], [[Konrad Waldorf]], _Smooth functors vs. differential forms_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.0663))

* [[João Faria Martins]], [[Roger Picken]], _On 2-dimensional holonomy_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/0710.4310))


## Path 3-groupoid 

A realization of the path [[3-groupoid]] as a [[Gray-groupoid]] internal to [[diffeological spaces]] appears in 

* [[João Faria Martins]], [[Roger Picken]], _The fundamental Gray 3-groupoid of a smooth manifold and local 3-dimensional holonomy based on a 2-crossed module_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.2566))
