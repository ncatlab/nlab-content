## Idea

A [[judgement]] on the right of the "$\vdash$"-symbol of a [[sequent]]/[[hypothetical judgement]]: a [[judgement]] that is a consequence of the [[antecedent]] judgements on the left of the symbol. 

If there is more than one [[disjunction|disjunctively]] connected consequent, these are called the _[[succedents]]_.
