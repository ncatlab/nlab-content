## Idea

_Higher Cartan geometry_ is the generalization of [[Cartan geometry]] to [[higher geometry]]. 

It is the globalized version of [[higher Klein geometry]].

As Cartan geometry is a special case of the theory of [[principal connections]], so higher Cartan geometry is a special case of the theory of [[connection on an ∞-bundle|∞-connection]] on [[principal ∞-bundles]].

## Definition

> Here is an evident proposal. Needs to be refined somewhat.


Let $\mathfrak{h} \to \mathfrak{g}$ be a morphism of [[L-∞ algebra]]s. Write $i : \mathbf{B}H \to \mathbf{B}G$ for a [[Lie integration]] to a moprhism of [[smooth ∞-groups]]. 
Notice that this defines a [[higher Klein geometry]]

$$
  G//H \to \mathbf{B}H \to \mathbf{B}G
  \,.
$$

Let $X$ be a [[smooth ∞-groupoid]]. For $x : * \to X$ any [[point]], write $T_x X$ for its tangent $L_\infty$-algebra.

An **$\infty$-Cartan geometry** over $X$ with respect to $i$ is

* a $G$-[[principal ∞-bundle]] $P \to X$ whose structure group reduces to $H$, hence such that there is morphism $g : X \to \mathbf{B}H$ and a [[fiber sequence]]
  
  $$
    P \to X \stackrel{i g}{\to} \mathbf{B}G
    \,,
  $$

* equipped with an $\mathfrak{g}$
  [[connection on an ∞-bundle|∞-connection]] $\nabla$;

* such that for every point $x : * \to X$ any any local trivialization, the canonical composite

  $$
   T_x X \stackrel{\nabla}{\to}
   \mathfrak{g}
   \stackrel{}{\to}
   \mathfrak{g}/\mathfrak{h}
  $$

  (of the [[∞-Lie algebra valued differential form]] of the connection at that point) with the [[quotient]] projection is an [[equivalence in an (∞,1)-category|equivalence]].

## Examples

### Higher Cartan super-Poincar&eacute;-geometry

Notice that ordinary [[gravity]] can be understood as the theory of $(O(d,1) \hookrightarrow Iso(d,1))$-[[Cartan geometry]], where $Iso(d,1)$ is the [[Poincare group]] and $O(d,1)$ the [[orthogonal group]] of [[Minkowski space]]. This is called the [[first order formulation of gravity]].

One can read the [[D'Auria-Fre formulation of supergravity]] as saying that higher dimensional [[supergravity]] is analogously given by higher Cartan supergeometry. See there and see the examples at [[higher Klein geometry]] for more on this.
