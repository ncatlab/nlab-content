## Idea

_Higher Cartan geometry_ is supposed to be the generalization of [[Cartan geometry]] to [[higher geometry]]; hence the theory of [[geometric homotopy types]] ([[manifolds]], [[orbifolds]], [[Lie groupoids]], [[geometric stacks]], [[smooth groupoids]], [[smooth infinity-groupoids]], ...) which are locally modeled on [[homotopy quotients]] $G/H$ of geometric [[infinity-groups]] -- the globalized version of [[higher Klein geometry]] (see also the [survey table](#Survey) below). 

This means that given a morphism $H \to G$ of suitably geometric [[∞-groups]] then a _higher Cartan geometry_ modeled on the [[homotopy quotient]] $G/H$ is a higher geometric space $X$ such as an [[orbifold]], [[geometric ∞-stack]], [[derived scheme]] etc. which, in some suitable sense, has its [[tangent spaces]] identified with an [[infinitesimal neighbourhood]] in $G/H$.

Just like traditional [[Cartan geometry]] (in particular in the guise of [[G-structures]]) captures a plethora of relevant kinds of geometries (([[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo]]-)[[Riemannian geometry]] ([Cartan 23](#Cartan23)), [[conformal geometry]], ... [[complex geometry]], [[symplectic geometry]], ..., [[parabolic geometry]]) so higher Cartan geometry is supposed to similarly govern types of [[higher differential geometry]].

A class of examples where aspects of higher Cartan geometry may be seen to secretly underly traditional discussion is the theory of [[super p-brane sigma-models]] on [[supergravity]] [[target space|target]]-[[super-spacetimes]]. This we consider in the examples [below](#SuperBraneGeometry).

## Motivation
 {#Motivation}

Here we informally survey motivation for higher Cartan geometry from phenomena and open problems visible in traditional geometry.

Alternatively, higher Cartan geometry may be motivated intrinsically simply as the result of [[synthetic geometry|synthetically]] formulating [[Cartan geometry]] in [[homotopy type theory]]. This is the way in which the _[definition below](#Definition)_ below proceeds. In the _[Examples](#Examples)_ we discuss how this abstract theory indeed serves to inform the motivating phenomena lister here.

### Pre-quantization of symplectic geometry
 {#MotivationPrequantizationOfSymplectic}

While a [[symplectic manifold]] structure $(X,\omega)$ is an example of an ([[integrable G-structure|integrable]]) [[G-structure]], hence of a [[Cartan geometry]], in many applications [[symplectic forms]] $\omega$ are to be refined to [[circle-bundles with connection]] $\nabla$ (with [[curvature]] $F_\nabla = \omega$), a refinement known as [[prequantization]]. Notice that while two [[differential forms]] on $X$ are either [[equal]] or not, two [[principal connections]] on $X$ may be different and still [[equivalence|equivalent]]: while there is just a [[set]] and hence a [[homotopy 0-type]] of [[symplectic forms]] on $X$, there is a [[groupoid]] and hence a [[homotopy 1-type]] of [[principal connections]] on $X$. It is in this sense that the pair $(X,\nabla)$ involves [[higher geometry]], namley [[homotopy n-types]] for $n \gt 0$.

In this way the pair $(X,\nabla)$ is still clearly a geometry of sorts, but not a Cartan geometry. On the other hand, it is still similar enough to be usefully regarded form this perspective:

Just like, by the [[Darboux theorem]], every symplectic manifold has an [[atlas]] by [[charts]] [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to $(\mathbb{R}^{2n}, \mathbf{d}p_i \wedge \mathbf{d}q^i)$, so every [[prequantum line bundle]] $\nabla$ on $X$ refining $\omega$ is [[equivalence|equivalent]] over this atlas to the $U(1)$-[[principal connection]] given by the globally defined connection for $\theta \coloneqq p_i \wedge \mathbf{d}q^i$. 

Moreover, just like the [[affine symplectic group]] is the [[stabilizer group]] of the local model $\mathbf{d}p_i \wedge \mathbf{d}q^i$ under the canonical [[Euclidean group]]-[[action]] on $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$, so the [[homotopy stabilizer group]] of $\theta$ covering this is the [[extended affine symplectic group]] which is the [[semidirect product]] of the [[Heisenberg group]] and the [[metaplectic group]]. In this sense [[metaplectic quantization]] is a pre-quantized higher analog of symplectic structure. 

While one may well reason, evidently, about pre-quantization of symplectic manifolds without a general theory of higher Cartan geometry in hand, this class of examples serves as a first blueprint for what higher Cartan geometry should be like, and points the way to its higher-degree generalizations considerd [below](#MotivationDefiniteParameterizationOfWZWTerms).

### Higher pre-quantization and Parameterized WZW terms
 {#MotivationDefiniteParameterizationOfWZWTerms}

A particularly interesting example of a pre-quantization as above is the Kac-Moody [[central extension]] of [[loop groups]] of [[compact Lie group|compact]] [[semisimple Lie group]] $G$ (see [here](loop+group#ByGeometricQuantization)). These may be understood as the [[transgression]] to [[loop space]] of a  higher-degree analog of traditional [[pre-quantization]] down on $G$: the canonical [[left invariant form|left invariant]] [[differential 3-form]] $\omega_3 = \langle-,[-,-]\rangle$ lifts to a [[circle 2-bundle with connection]] $\nabla^G$. This is also called the _[[WZW gerbe]]_ or _WZW term_, as its [[volume holonomy]] serves as the [[gauge interaction]] [[action functional]] for the [[Wess-Zumino-Witten sigma model]] with [[target space]] $G$.

Since the 2-connections on $G$ form a [[2-groupoid]] hence a [[homotopy 2-type]], the pair $(G,\nabla^G)$ may be regarded as being an object in yet a bit higher differential geometry.

Now given a $G$-[[principal bundle]] $P\to X$, then a natural question is whether there is a _definite parameterization_ of $\nabla^G$ to a 2-form connection on $P$ which restricts fiberwise to $\nabla^G$ in a suitable sense up to [[gauge transformation]]. Such _[[parameterized WZW terms]]_ play a key role in [[heterotic string theory]] and [[equivariant elliptic cohomology]].

One finds that such definite parameterizations are equivalent to [[lift of structure group|lifts of structure group]] of the bundle from $G$ to the [[homotopy stabilizer group]] of $\nabla^G$ under the right $G$-action on itself, and this turns out to be the [[string 2-group]] $String(G)$. 

While this class of examples is not yet Cartan geometry proper (higher or not) since the bundle here is not a [[tangent bundle]], it contains in it the key aspect of definitie parameterizations of higher pre-quantized forms related to higher [[G-structures]]. Such definite parameterizations turn out to be part of genuine examples of higher Cartan geometry, to which we turn [below](#MotivationDefiniteGlobalizationOfWZWTerms) and key ingredients of higher Cartan geometry apply to both cases.

More generally, one considers this situation for WZW terms on [[coset spaces]] $G/H$ (the _[[gauged WZW model]]_), and their definite parameterization over $G/H$-[[fiber bundles]]. 

### Interlude: Super-Cartan geometry
 {#MotivationSuperCartanGeometry}

Before further motiviating ever higher Cartan geometry, it serves to pause and realize that while passing from manifolds to [[stacks]], we are in particular first of all generalizing to [[sheaves]]. So even before going higher in homotopy degree, one may ask how much of Cartan geometry may be formulated in [[sheaf toposes]], first over the [[site]] of [[smooth manifolds]] itself, which leads to Cartan geoemtry in the generality of [[smooth spaces]], and next over [[sites]] other than that of [[smooth manifolds]]. 

One key example for this is [[supergeometry]]. Where a major application of traditonal Cartan geometry is its restriction to [[orthogonal structures]] encoding ([[pseudo-Riemannian geometry|pseudo]]-)[[Riemannian geometry]] of particular relevance in the theory of [[gravity]], the analogous orthogonal structures in [[supergeometry]] serve to set up the theory of [[supergravity]]. 

More in detail, after picking a [[dimension]] $d\in \mathbb{N}$ and writing $\mathfrak{Iso}(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1})$ for the [[Poincaré Lie algebra]], then a choice of "number of supersymmetries" is a choice of [real spin representation](spin+representation#RealIrreducibleSpinRepresentationInLorentzSignature) $N$. Then the [[direct sum]] 

$$
  \mathfrak{Iso}(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1|N})
  \coloneqq
  \underbrace{\mathfrak{Iso}(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1})}_{even} \oplus \underbrace{N}_{odd}
$$

regarded as a [[super vector space]] with $N$ in odd degree becomes a [[super Lie algebra]] by letting the $[even,odd]$ bracket to be given by the defining [[action]] and by letting the $[odd,odd]$ bracket be given by a canonically induced bilinear and $\mathfrak{o}$-equivariant pairing -- the [[super Poincaré Lie algebra]]. This still canonical contains the [[Lorentz Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{o}(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1})$ and the [[quotient]]

$$
  \mathbb{R}^{d-1,1|N} 
  \coloneqq
  \mathfrak{Iso}(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1|N})/\mathfrak{o}(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1})
$$

is called [[super Minkowski spacetime]] (equipped with its [[super translation Lie algebra]] structure).

From this, a super-Cartan geometry is defined in direct analogy to the Cartan formulation of Riemannian geometry


| [[Cartan geometry]] | $\mathfrak{g}$ | $\mathfrak{h}$ | $\mathfrak{g}/\mathfrak{h}$ |
|---------------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------------------|
| [[pseudo-Riemannian geometry]]/[[Einstein gravity]]  | $\mathfrak{Iso}(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1})$ | $\mathfrak{o}(d-1,1)$ | $\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1}$ |
| [[supergravity]] | $\mathfrak{Iso}(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert N})$ | $\mathfrak{o}(d-1,1)$ | $\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert N}$ |


Indeed, all the traditional literature on supergravity (e.g. ([Castellani-D'Auria-Fré 91](#CastellaniDAuriaFre91))) is phrased, more or less explicitly, in terms of [[Cartan connections]] for the inclusion of the [[Lorentz group]] into the [[super Poincaré group]], this being the formalization of what physicists mean when saying that they pass to "local supersymmetry".

It so happens that from within such super-Cartan geometry there appear some of the most interesting examples of what should be higher Cartan geometry, hence _higher super-Cartan geometry_. This we turn to [below](#MotivationDefiniteGlobalizationOfWZWTerms).

### Higher pre-quantization and Globalized WZW terms
 {#MotivationDefiniteGlobalizationOfWZWTerms}

Given a [[vector space]] $V$ equipped with a (constant, i.e. translationally [[left invariant form|left invariant]]) [[differential n-form|differential (p+2)-form]]

$$
  \phi \in \Omega^{p+2}(V)
$$

a natural question to ask is for a $V$-manifold $X$ (i.e. an $n$-dimensional manifold if $V \simeq \mathbb{R}^n$) to carry a differential form

$$
  \omega \in \Omega^2(X)
$$

which is a [[definite form]], definite on $\phi$, in that its restriction to each [[tangent space]] is equal, up to a $GL(V)$-transformation, to $\phi$.

Standard theory of [[G-structures]] easily shows that such definite forms correspond to $Stab_{GL(V)}(\phi)$-structures on $X$, for $Stab_{GL(V)}(\phi)$ the [[stabilizer group]] of $\phi$ under the canonical $GL(V)$-[[action]] (by [[pullback of differential forms]]).

For instance if $V = \mathbb{R}^7$ and $\phi \in \Omega^3(V)$ is the [[associative 3-form]], then $Stab_{GL(V)}(\phi) = G_2$ is the [[exceptional Lie group]] [[G2]] and this yields [[G2-structures]]. 


But in view of the [above](#MotivationDefiniteParameterizationOfWZWTerms) discussion one is led to re-state this question for the case that $\phi$ is refined to a [[prequantum n-bundle|prequantum (p+1)-bundle]] $\nabla$. A _[[definite globalization]]_ of this over a $V$-manifold $X$ should be a [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle (p+1)-connection]] on $X$ which suitably, up to the relavant [[higher gauge transformations]], restrics locally to $\nabla$.

This problem indeed appears in the formulation of [[super p-brane sigma models]] on [[target space|target]] [[super-spacetimes]]. Here $V$ is a [[super Minkowski spacetime]], $\phi$ is an exceptional [[super Lie algebra]] [[Lie algebra cohomology|cocycle]] of degree $(p+2)$ and the formulation of the [[Green-Schwarz sigma model]] requires that it is refined (higher pre-qauntized) to a higher WZW term, a $p$-form connection. The [[supergravity]] [[equations of motion]] imply a [[definite globalization]] $\omega$ of $\phi$ of a [[super-spacetime]], but to globally define the GS-WZW model one hence needs to lift this globalization to a $(p+1)$-connection, too (thereby "canceling the [[classical anomaly]]" of the model).

These definite globalizations are in particular definite parameterizations, as above, of the restriction of the higher WZW term to the [[infinitesimal disk]]-bundle of spacetime, and hence they imply higher $G$-structure along the above lines. 

It is here that developing a theory of higher Cartan geometry has real potential, since, while the globalizations of the forms $\phi$ have been extensively studied in the literature, the globalization of their pre-quantized refinement to higher WZW-terms has traditionally received almost no attention yet. A brief mentioning of the necessity of considering appears for instance in ([Witten 86, p. 17](#Witten86)), but traditional tools do get one very far in this question.
 
More precisely, this is the situation for all those [[branes]] in the old [[brane scan]] which have no tensor-multiplets on the [[worldvolume]], equivalently those on which no other branes may end (such as the [[string]] or the [[M2-brane]], but not the [[D-branes]] and not the [[M5-brane]]). For more general branes, it turns out that the target space itself is a higher geoemtric space. This leads us to higher Cartan geometry proper. This we turn to now.


### Higher Cartan connections and Stacky Cartan geometries
 {#HigherCartanConnectionsAndStackyCartanGeometries}

A traditonal [[Cartan connection]], being a [[principal connection]] satisfying some extra conditions, is locally (on some [[chart]] $U \to X$) in particular a [[Lie algebra valued differential form]] $A \in \Omega^1(U,\mathfrak{g})$. Following Cartan, this is equivalently a [[homomorphism]] of [[dg-algebras]] of the form

$$
  \Omega^\bullet(U) \longleftarrow W(\mathfrak{g}) \colon A
$$

from the [[Weil algebra]] of the [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ to the [[de Rham complex]] of $U$, equivalently a homomorphism of just [[graded algebras]]

$$
  \Omega^\bullet(U) \longleftarrow CE(\mathfrak{g}) \colon A
$$

from the [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] of $\mathfrak{g}$. (Requiring this second morphism to also respect the dg-algebra structure, hence the differential, is equivalent to requiring the [[curvature]] form $F_A$ to vanish, hence to the connection being a [[flat connection]]).

In particular for the description of [[supergravity]] [[superspacetimes]] one considers this for $\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{Iso}(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1|N})$ the [[super Poincaré Lie algebra]] of some [[super Minkowski spacetime]] $\mathbb{R}^{d-1|N}$. This serves to encode a [[Levi-Civita connection]] as for ordinary [[gravity]] modeled by ordinary [[orthogonal structure]] [[Cartan geometry]], together with the [[gravitino]] field.

In detail, the [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] $CE(\mathfrak{Iso}(\mathbb{R}^{10,1|N=1}))$ for 11-dimensional [[Minkowski spacetime]] turned super via the unique irreducible 32-dimensional [[spin representation]] (see [here](spin+representation#RealIrreducibleSpinRepresentationInLorentzSignature)) is freely generated as a [[graded commutative algebra|graded commutative]] [[superalgebra]] on 

* elements $\{e^a\}_{a = 1}^{11}$ and $\{\omega^{ a b}\}$ of degree $(1,even)$;

* and elements $\{\psi^\alpha\}_{\alpha = 1}^{32}$ of degree $(1,odd)$

and as a [[differential graded algebra]] its [[differential]] $d_{CE}$ is determined by the equations

$$
  d_{CE} \, \omega^{a b} = \omega^a{}_b \wedge \omega^{b c}
$$

$$
  d_{CE} \, e^{a } = \omega^a{}_b \wedge e^b + \frac{i}{2}\bar \psi \Gamma^a \psi
  \,.
$$

An algebra homomorphism as above sends these generators to differential forms of the corresponding degree, the [[vielbein]]

$$
  E^a \coloneqq A(e^a) \in \Omega^{(1,even)}(U)
  \,,
$$

whe [[spin connection]]

$$
  \Omega^{a}{}_{b} \coloneqq A(\omega^a{}_b) \in \Omega^{(1,even)}(U)
$$

and the [[gravitino]]

$$
  \Psi^\alpha \coloneqq A(\psi^\alpha) \in \Omega^{(1,odd)}(U)
  \,.
$$

But a key aspect of higher dimensional [[supergravity]] theories is that their [[field (physics)|field]] content necessarily includes, in addition to the [[graviton]] and the [[gravitino]], higher [[differential n-form]] fields, notably the 2-fom [[B-field]] of 10-dimensional [[type II supergravity]] and [[heterotic supergravity]] as well as the 3-form [[C-field]] of [[11-dimensional supergravity]].

This means that these higher dimensional supergravity theories are not in fact entirely described  by super-[[Cartan geometry]]. This is to be contrasted with the fact that the very motivation for Cartan geometry, in the original article ([Cartan 23](#Cartan23)), was the mathematical formulation of the [[theory (physics)|theory]] of [[gravity]] ([[general relativity]]).

Now a key insight due to ([D'Auria-Fré-Regge 80](#DAuriaFreRegge80), [D'Auria-Fré 82](#DAuriaFre82)) was that the "tensor multiplet" fields of higher dimensional supergravity theories as above are naturally brought into the previous perspective if only one allows more general [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebras]]. 

Namely, we may add to the above CE-algabra

* a single generator $c_3$ of degree $(3,even)$ 

and extend the differential to that by the formula

$$
  d_{CE} \, c_3 = \frac{1}{2}\bar \psi \Gamma^{a b} \wedge \psi \wedge e_a \wedge e_b
  \,.
$$

This still squares to zero due to the remarkable property of 11d [[super Minkowski spacetime]] by which $\frac{1}{2}\bar \psi \Gamma^{a b} \wedge \psi \wedge e_a \wedge e_b \in CE^4(\mathfrak{Iso}(10,1|N=1))$ is a representative of an exception [[super Lie algebra|super]]-[[Lie algebra cohomology]] class. (The collection of all these exceptional classes constitutes what is known as the _[[brane scan]]_).

In the textbook ([Castellani-D'Auria-Fré 91](#CastellaniDAuriaFre91)) a beautiful algorithm for constructing and handling higher supergravity theories based on such generalized CE-algebras is presented, but it seems fair to say that the authors struggle a bit with the right mathematical perspective to describe what is really happening here.

But from a modern perspective this becomes crystal clear: these generalized CE algebras are CE-algebras not of [[Lie algebras]] but of [[strong homotopy Lie algebra]], hence of [[L-infinity algebras]], in fact of [[Lie n-algebras|Lie (p+1)-algebras]] for $(p+1)$ the degree of the relevant differential form field. 

Specifically, me may write the above generalized CE-algebra with the extra degree-3 generator $c_3$ as the CE-algebra $CE(\mathfrak{m}2\mathfrak{brane}) $

of the _[[supergravity Lie 3-algebra]]_ $\mathfrak{m}2\mathfrak{brane}$.

Now a morphism

$$
  \Omega^\bullet(U) \stackrel{}{\longleftarrow} CE(\mathfrak{m}2\mathfrak{brane}) \;\colon\; A
$$

encodes [[graviton]] and [[gravitino]] fields as above, but in addition it encodes a 3-form

$$
  C_3 \coloneqq A(c_3) \in \Omega^{(3,even)}(U)
$$

whose [[curvature]] 

$$
  G_4 = \mathbf{d}C_3 + \frac{1}{2}\bar \Psi \Gamma^{a b} \wedge \Psi \wedge E_a \wedge E_b
$$

satisfies a modified [[Bianchi identity]], crucial for the theory of [[11-dimensional supergravity]] ([D'Auria-Fré 82](#DAuriaFre82)).

So this collection of differential form data is no longer a [[Lie algebra valued differential form]], it is an [[L-infinity algebra valued differential form]], with values in the [[supergravity Lie 3-algebra]]. 

The quotient

$$
  \widehat{\mathbb{R}}^{10,1|N=1}
  \coloneqq
  \mathfrak{g}/\mathfrak{h}
  =
  \mathfrak{m}2\mathfrak{brane} / \mathfrak{o}(\mathbb{R}^{10,1|N=1})
$$

is known as _[[extended super Minkowski spacetime]]_.

The [[Lie integration]] of this is a [[smooth infinity-group|smooth 3-group]] $G$ which receives a map from the [[Lorentz group]].

This means that a global description of the geometry which ([Castellani-D'Auria-Fré 91](#CastellaniDAuriaFre91)) discuss locally on [[charts]] has to be a higher kind of Cartan geometry which is locally modeled not just on [[cosets]], but on the [[homotopy quotients]] of ([[smooth infinity-group|smooth]], [[smooth super infinity-groupoid|supergeometric]], ...) [[infinity-groups]].

### Definite higher WZW terms on stacky Cartan geometries
 {#DefiniteWZWTermsOnStackyCartanGeometries}

Once such a higher Cartan super-spacetime $X$ as [above](#HigherCartanConnectionsAndStackyCartanGeometries) has been obtained, then we are back to the [above](#MotivationDefiniteGlobalizationOfWZWTerms) question of constructing [[definite globalizations of WZW terms]] over it.

Indeed, the [[super p-brane sigma-models]] of the [[D-branes]] and the [[M5-brane]] have [[WZW terms]] defined not on plain [[super Minkowski spacetimes]], but on the above [[extended super Minkowski spacetimes]].  For instance the WZW term of the [[M5-brane]] sigma model is a [[higher prequantization]] of the 7-form 

$$
  \omega_7 
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \frac{1}{2} \bar \psi \wedge \Gamma^{a_1 \cdots a_5} \psi \wedge e_{a_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge e_{a_5}
   +
  \frac{13}{2} \bar \psi \Gamma^{a_1 a_2} \psi \wedge e_{a_1} \wedge e_{a_2} \wedge c_3
 \;\;\;
 \in 
  CE^7(\widehat{\mathbb{R}}^{10,1|N=1})
$$

on the above extended super-Minkowski spacetime, where $c_3$ is the extra degree-3 generator discussed above.

Under [[Lie integration]] this becomes ([FSS 13](#FSS13)) a degree-7 WZW term defined on a [[smooth super infinity-groupoid|supergeometric 3-group]] $G/H$ and defining the M5-brane sigma model on a curved supergravity target space means to construct [[definite globalizations]] of this over higher Cartan geometries $X$ modeled on this [[homotopy quotient]] $G/H$.

The result $(X,\mathbf{L}^X)$ is a pair which is still analogous to the [[symplectic geometry|symplectic geometries]] that we started with, but is now in higher geometric homotopy theory in every possible sense.

There is much interesting structure known to be hidden in this pair. One finds ([dcct, sections 1.2.11.3 and 1.2.15.3.3](#dcct)) that the higher analog of [[symplectomorphisms]], namely [[quantomorphism n-group|higher quantomorphisms]]

$$
  \phi \colon X \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} X
$$

$$
  \eta \colon \phi^\ast \mathbf{L}^X \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} \mathbf{L}
$$

for the [[smooth super infinity-groupoid|supergeometric 7-group]] with is the [[Lie integration]] of the [[M-theory Lie algebra]] of $X$, witnessing the degree of $X$ being a "[[BPS state]]" of 11d supergravity. These BPS states are known to be an immensely rich mathematical topic (e.g. "[[wall crossing]]"), but one sees here that it is but the local and infinitesimal shadow of a much richer structure: higher isometries in higher super-Cartan geometry.

Notice that ordinary [[gravity]] can be understood as the theory of $(O(d,1) \hookrightarrow Iso(d,1))$-[[Cartan geometry]], where $Iso(d,1)$ is the [[Poincare group]] and $O(d,1)$ the [[orthogonal group]] of [[Minkowski space]]. This is called the [[first order formulation of gravity]].

One can read the [[D'Auria-Fre formulation of supergravity]] as saying that higher dimensional [[supergravity]] is analogously given by higher Cartan supergeometry. See there and see the examples at [[higher Klein geometry]] for more on this.
