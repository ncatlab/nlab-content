## Idea

An equivalence class is an [[element]] of a [[quotient set]].


## Definitions

There are a variety of ways to make this precise.


### Axiomatic

Let $S$ be a [[set]], and let ${\sim}$ be an [[equivalence relation]] on $S$.  Then there exists a set $S/{\sim}$, the __quotient set__ of $S$ modulo $\sim$.  Given any element $x$ of $S$, there is an element $[x]_{\sim}$ of $S/{\sim}$, the __equivalence class__ of $x$ modulo ${\sim}$.  Every element of $S/{\sim}$ is of this form.  Furthermore, $[x]_{\sim}$ and $[y]_{\sim}$ are equal in $S/{\sim}$ if and only if $x \sim y$ in $S$.

The [[axiom of quotients]] is an axiom of [[set theory]] which states that the paragraph above is true.  It corresponds to the clause in the definition of a [[pretopos]] (or in [[Giraud's axioms]] for a [[Grothendieck topos]]) that every [[congruence]] has a [[coequaliser]].  In most formulations of set theory, this axiom is not needed; instead, it is a theorem when equivalence classes are defined in one of the ways below.


### As subsets

Again, let $S$ be a set, and let ${\sim}$ be an equivalence relation on $S$.  Let $x$ be an element of $S$.  Then the __equivalence class__ of $x$ modulo ${\sim}$ is the [[subset]] of $S$ consisting of those elements of $S$ that are equivalent to $x$:
$$ [x]_{\sim} \coloneqq \{ y\colon S \;|\; x \sim y \} .$$
Then the __quotient set__ $S/{\sim}$ is the collection of these equivalence classes.

We may construct this collection using the [[power set]] of $S$; therefore, this may be done in any [[elementary topos]] as well as in such diverse set theories as [[ZFC]], [[SEAR]], and [[ETCS]].  This definition of equivalence class is quite natural in [[material set theory]], since it immediately produces a set (assuming that subsets are sets).


### Redefined equality

In some [[foundations of mathematics]], sets are not fundamental, but are defined as more basic [[presets]] (sometimes called [[types]] or, confusingly, sets).  By definition, a set (sometimes called a [[setoid]]) is a preset equipped with an equivalence (pre)relation.

Once more, let $S$ be a set, and let ${\sim}$ be an equivalence relation on $S$.  Then the quotient set $S/{\sim}$ is the the underlying preset of $S$ equipped with $\sim$ (in place of the original equality on $S$), and the equivalence class $[x]_{\sim}$ is simply $x$.


### As objects of a groupoid

One can also consider sets as [[groupoids]] (or $\infty$-[[infinity-groupoid|groupoids]]) with the property of being [[discrete groupoid|discrete]].

So again, let $S$ be a set, and let ${\sim}$ be an equivalence relation on $S$.  Then the quotient set $S/{\sim}$ is the (higher) groupoid whose objects are the same as those of $S$ and with a single morphism from $x$ to $y$ iff $x \sim y$ (and none otherwise); $[x]_{\sim}$ is simply $x$ again.
