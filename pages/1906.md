Given a _commutative_ [[ring]] $k$ and an associative  $k$-algebra $A$ over $k$, the tensor product $A\otimes_k A$ is equipped with two [[bimodule]] structures, "outer" and "inner". For outer structure $a\cdot_o(b\otimes c)\cdot_o d = ab\otimes cd$ and for inner $a\cdot_i(b\otimes c)\cdot_i d = bd\otimes ac$. The two bimodule structures mutually commute. A $k$-linear map $\alpha\in Hom_k(A,A\otimes A)$ is called a __double derivation__ if its is also a map of $A$-bimodules with respect to _outer_ bimodule structure ($\alpha\in A-mod-A({}_A A_A,{}_A A\otimes_k A_A)$); thus the $k$-module becomes an $A$-bimodule - usually denoted $Der(A,A\otimes A)$ -- with respect _inner_ $A$-bimodule structure.

The tensor algebra $T_A Der(A,A\otimes A)$ of the $A$-bimodule $Der(A,A\otimes A)$ (=the free monoid on $Der(A,A\otimes A)$ in the monoidal category of $A$-bimodules) is a step in the definition of the [[deformed preprojective algebra]]s of Crawley-Bovey.
