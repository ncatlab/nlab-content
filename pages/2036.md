###### Definition

A [[magma]] $A$ is (left and right) __alternative__ if its product satisfies

* left alternativity $x(x y)=(x x)y$ for all $x,y\in A$

* right alternativity $(x y)y=x(y y)$ for all $x,y\in A$

A [[nonassociative algebra]] $(A,\cdot,+)$ is __alternative__ if its underlying magma $(A,\cdot)$ alternative.

## Properties

### In terms of the associator

+-- {: .num_prop #InTermsOfAssociator}
###### Proposition

For a [[nonassociative algebra]] $A$ in [[characteristic]] different from 2, then, alternativity according to def. \ref{AlternativeAlgebra} is equivalent to the condition that the [[associator]], i.e. the [[multilinear map|tri-linear map]]

$$
  [-,-,-] \;\colon\; A \otimes A \otimes A \longrightarrow A
$$

given by

$$
  [a,b,c] \coloneqq (a b) c - a (b c)
$$

is skew-symmetric, in that for any [[permutation]] $\sigma$ of three elements then $[a_{\sigma_1}, a_{\sigma_2}, a_{\sigma_3}] = (-1)^{\vert \sigma\vert} [a_1, a_2, a_3]$ for $\vert \sigma \vert$ the [[signature of a permutation|signature of the permutation]].

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

In one direction, alternativity together with the multi-linearity of the product says that the associator is skew symmetric in adjacent arguments

$$
  0 = [(x+y),(x+y),z] = [x,y,z] + [y,x,z]
$$

$$
  0 = [z,(x+y),(x+y)] = [z,x,y] + [z,y,x]  
$$

and hence in all arguments.

In the other direction, skew-symmetry of the associator implies alternativity by 

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    & [x,x,y] = -[x,x,y] 
    \\
    \Leftrightarrow &  2 [x,x,y] = 0
    \\
    \Leftrightarrow & [x,x,y] = 0
  \end{aligned}
$$

using the assumption that 2 is invertible in $A$. Similarly for $[y,x,x] = 0$.

###### Proposition

A [[nonassociative algebra]] is alternative, def. \ref{AlternativeAlgebra}, prop. \ref{InTermsOfAssociator}, precisely if the [[subalgebra]] generated by any two elements is an [[associative algebra]].

=--

This is due to [[Emil Artin]], see for instance ([Schafer 95, p. 18](#Schafer95)).

+-- {: .num_prop #ZornTheorem}
###### Proposition

The only alternative [[division algebras]] over the [[real numbers]] are the [[real numbers]] themselves, the [[complex numbers]], the [[quaternions]] and the [[octonions]].

=--

This is due to ([Zorn 30](#Zorn30)).

## Examples

In particular, every [[associative algebra]] is alternative. 

The properly [[nonassociative algebra]] of [[octonions]] is also alternative. The reason is that it is obtained by a [[double of algebra with involution|doubling procedure]] from the algebra of [[quaternions]] which is associative; and the double of any associative $\mathbf{R}$-algebra with involution is alternative.
