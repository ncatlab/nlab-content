A [[magma]] $A$ is (left and right) __alternative__ if its product satisfies

* left alternativity $x(x y)=(x x)y$ for all $x,y\in A$
* right alternativity $(x y)y=x(y y)$ for all $x,y\in A$

A [[nonassociative algebra]] $(A,\cdot,+)$ is __alternative__ if its underlying magma $(A,\cdot)$ alternative. 

In particular, every [[associative algebra]] is alternative. The properly *non*associative algebra of [[octonion]]s is also alternative. The reason is that it is obtained by a [[double of algebra with involution|doubling procedure]] from the algebra of [[quaternion]]s which is associative; and the double of any associative $\mathbf{R}$-algebra with involution is alternative.
