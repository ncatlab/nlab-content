## About this text
 {#AboutThisPage}

This page is going to contain an introduction to aspects of [[differential geometry]] and their application in fundamental [[physics]]: the [[gauge theory]] appearing in the [[standard model of particle physics]] and the [[Riemannian geometry]] appearing in the [[standard model of cosmology]], as well as the [[symplectic geometry]] appearing in the [[quantization]] of both.

### Scope and perspective

The intended topic scope and readership of the first layer of this page -- the _[Model Layer](#LayerMod)_ --  is much like that of the book ([Frankel](#Frankel)), only that here we make use of a more modern and more transparent conceptual toolbox. We also discuss in two other layers, the _[Semantic Layer](#LayerSem)_ and the _[Syntactic Layer](#LayerSyn)_ deeper mechanisms at work in the background.

Notably, where traditional expositions of [[differential geometry]] proceed by generalizing the [[geometry]] of abstract [[coordinate|coordinate systems]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ to _[[smooth manifolds]]_, here we instead begin by generalizing, in _[Smooth spaces -- Model Layer](SmoothSpacesLayerMod)_, coordinate systems right away to _[[smooth spaces]]_, which happens to be both more expressive as well as actually much easier. In parallel (and to be read independently or not at all) we discuss in _[Smooth spaces -- Semantic Layer](#SmoothSpacesLayerSem)_ how this means that we are working in the _[[sheaf topos]]_ over abstract coordinate systems.  Smooth manifolds are then introduced later as an intermediate notion, together with that of _[[diffeological spaces]]_. (Many of the constructions in [[differential geometry]] applied in [[physics]] do not actually need the notion of a smooth manifold, and, more importantly, for many notions in modern theoretical physics smooth manifolds are not actually sufficiently general.) 

In fact we introduce smooth manifolds only after we introduce _[[smooth groupoids]]_ (below in _[Smooth homotopy type - Model Layer - Smooth groupoids](#SmoothGroupoids))_, which are differential geometric structures that are _still_ simpler than smooth manifolds, and of course even more expressive than smooth spaces. Moreover, smooth groupoids are at the very heart of the geometry of physics: modern fundamental physics is all based on the "[[gauge symmetry|gauge principle]]" and in  _[Model Layer -- Gauge transformations in electromagnetism](#GaugeTransformationsInElectromagnetism)_ we explain how, mathematically, this is essentially nothing but the theory of smooth groupoids. As further background information we discuss in _[Smooth homotopy types - Semantic Layer](#SmoothHomotopyTypesSemanticLayer)_ how this means that we are working in a [[(infinity,1)-topos|higher topos]] over abstract coordinate systems, and in _[Smooth homotopy type - Syntactic Layer](#SmoothHomotopyTypesSyntacticLayer)_ how this means that we are reasoning about physics using the _[[natural deduction]]_ rules of _[[homotopy type theory]]_.

From this setup then naturally flow all the many structures and phenomena seen in the geometry of physics:




### Layers of exposition
 {#Layers}

We discuss each topic below in three stages, in three _layers_. 

1. The first layer, called the **Model Layer **, deals with concrete explicit  constructions as familiar from traditional textbooks on differential geometry and physics. This layer is supposed to be readable and useful all in itself and the reader who feels that this is all he or she wants to see can stick to this and ignore the other layers. In particular, while the _Model Layer_ does invoke the basic notion of a _[[category]]_ and of a _[[functor]]_ -- which are as simple as the notions of [[group]] or [[associative algebra|algebra]] --, it does not use any actual _[[category theory]]_. 
 {#LayerMod}

1. The second layer, called the **Semantic Layer**, makes explicit the ([[(infinity,1)-category theory|higher]]) [[category theory]] and ([[(infinity,1)-topos theory|higher]]) [[topos theory]] at work in the background. This puts the concrete constructions of the _Model Layer_ into a more general context and helps to see certain organizational patterns that underlie the seemingly different phenomena. It provides some powerful theorems which the _Model Layer_ is secretly benefitting from. For instance this layer gives a systematic rule for generalizing everything at the beginning Model Layers from ordinary [[differential geometry]] to what is called  _[[supergeometry]]_, which is the context in which [[fermion|fermionic]] [[particles]] are formalized: the [[matter]] constituents of the [[observable universe]].
 {#LayerSem}

1. The third layer, called the **Syntactic Layer**, makes explicit the expression of these phenomena in the [[logical framework|formal]] [[internal language]] of the [[topos]] of [[smooth spaces]] -- which is _[[dependent type theory|dependent]] [[type theory]]_ -- and of the [[(infinity,1)-topos|higher topos]] of [[smooth infinity-groupoid|smooth higher groupoids]] -- which is _[[homotopy type theory]]_. This makes more transparent various constructions in ([[(infinity,1)-topos theory|higher]]) [[topos theory]] used in _Semantic Layer_, and in fact it provides 
a [[categorical semantics|natural construction principle]] for objects in a (higher) topos that model some intended _meaning_ -- which is precisely what [[mathematical physics]] is all about.
This is meant for readers who enjoy seeing fundamental physics _naturally_ rooted in genuinely fundamental mathematics, in _[[natural deduction]]_ from _[[practical foundations]]_, as it were. Everybody else should ignore this.
 {#LayerSyn}
 
**The three layers**

* **Model Layer** -- [[concrete particular]]: [[models]]

* **Semantic Layer** -- [[concrete general]]: [[categorical semantics]] in [[(infinity,1)-topos theory|higher]] [[topos theory]]

* **Syntactic Layer** -- [[abstract general]]: [[syntax]] in [[homotopy type theory|homotopy]]-[[type theory]]

This [[topos theory|topos-theoretic]] perspective on fundamental [[physics]] which is discussed here is mostly original in the identifications it makes ([Schreiber](#SchreiberCohesiveInfinityTopos)), but it draws insights and inspiration from (and maybe realizes) a vision already expressed since the 1960s by [[William Lawvere]], one of the central figures in the development of [[topos theory]] and [[categorical logic]]. Lawvere links the very inception of topos theory to the motivation to axiomatize physics:

> My own motivation $[$ for developing [[topos theory]] $]$ came from my earlier study of [[physics]]. The foundation of the [[continuum physics]] of general materials, $[...]$ involves powerful and clear physical ideas which unfortunately have been submerged under a mathematical apparatus including not only [[Cauchy sequences]] and countably additive [[measures]], but also ad hoc choices of [[charts]] for [[manifolds]] and of [[inverse limits]] of [[Sobolev space|Sobolev]] [[Hilbert spaces]], to get at the simple [[nuclear spaces]] of intensively and extensively variable quantities. But, as Fichera lamented, all this apparatus may well be helpful in the solution of certain problems, but can the problems themselves and the needed [[axioms]] be stated in a direct and clear manner? And might this not lead to a simpler, equally rigorous account? ([Lawvere, 2000](#Lawvere2000))

More historical pointers along these lines and further related material can also be found at _[[higher category theory and physics]]_.

To give a survey of how the exposition below proceeds in the fashion of these three layers, the following section _[The full story in a few formal words](#TabulatedIndex)_ provides what may be read as  commented _index_ to the central themes of the following text. Whereas the exposition below is organized to start each topic with the discussion of its concrete [[models]] in a [Model layer](#LayerMod), then pass to a general abstract semantics in a [Semantic Layer](#LayerSem) and then finally to the abstract formal syntax in a [Syntactic Layer](#LayerMod), these tables indicates how this passage to abstract syntax usefully reflects back onto the concrete theory: 

The leftmost columns of the following tables formulate concepts in terms of ordinary language. The second columns translate that ordinary language fairly directly to the formal language of ([[homotopy type theory|homotopy]]) [[type theory]]. The third columns then interprets these formal syntactical expressions as [[universal constructions]] in a ([[(infinity,1)-topos|higher]], [[cohesive (infinity,1)-topos|cohesive]]) [[topos]] by the rules of [[categorical semantics]].
Finally, the fourth columns indicate what this universal construction amounts to when concretely realized in the [[model]] given by [[smooth spaces]] and [[smooth ∞-groupoids]]. Finally the rightmost columns point to the chapters in the text below that deal with the given construction.

These tables show that fairly evident and na&iuml;ve sounding statements in ordinary language turn under this translation into what is generally regarded as fairly sophisticated constructions. In fact some of these constructions have only been found by translating along the categorical semantics dictionary this way. So the following tables also serves to show how the general abstract discussion here is a means to facilitate reasoning about seemingly complicated concepts underlying fundamental physics:


### The full story in a few formal words
 {#TabulatedIndex}

We give an overview in the spirit of _[Synthetic Quantum Field Theory](#SyntheticQuantumFieldTheory)_.

The fundamental [[physics]] of the [[observable universe|observed world]]  is governed by what is called _[[quantum theory]]_. (This is explicitly so for the [[standard model of particle physics]] and induced from this all fundamental physics ever tested in laboratories; but by all that is known also the remaining ingredient of [[gravity]] is fundamentally a quantum theory, see at [[quantum gravity]] for comments).

Two major axiomatizations of [[quantum theory]] are known, namely 


1. _[[FQFT]]_ where one axiomatizes the assignment of [[spaces of states]] to pieces of [[worldvolume]] (the "[[Schrödinger picture]]" of quantum theory) 

   fragments of which involve:

   * [[finite quantum mechanics in terms of dagger-compact categories]]

   * [[spectral triples]] and [[graph field theory]] [[quantum mechanics]]

   * [[2-spectral triples]] and [[string]] [[sigma-models]]

   * [[Reshetikhin-Turaev construction]] for 3d [[TQFT]]

   * [[FFRS-formalism|FRS-construction]] of 2d [[CFT]] from this via [[holography]]

   * [[extended topological quantum field theories]]
  

1. _[[AQFT]]_ where one axiomatizes the assignment of [[algebras of observables]] to pieces of [[worldvolume]] (the "[[Heisenberg picture]]" of quantum theory)

   fragments of which involve:

   * [[Wightman axioms]], [[Haag-Kastler axioms]]

   * [[Bohr toposes]], [[schreiber:bachelor thesis Nuiten|Bohrification of local nets of observables]]

   * [[factorization algebras]], [[factorization homology]], [[topological chiral homology]], 

(For an attempt at a survey of the state of the art as of 2011 see the collection ([Sati-Schreiber](#SatiSchreiber))).

But all fundamental [[quantum field theories]] observed in (or conjectured to underlie) nature arise by a process called _[[quantization]]_ from structures in [[differential geometry]] (or are induced via a mechanism called the [[holographic principle]] from such that do). 

This differential geometric data involves 

* [[smooth function|smooth]] [[nonlinear functional|functionals]] -- called _[[action functionals]]_ 

* on [[smooth infinity-groupoid|smooth "spaces"]] -- called _[[moduli stacks]]_ 

* of [[differential geometry|differential geometric]] structures such as [[fiber bundles]] and [[connection on a bundle|connections]] -- called _[[gauge fields|gauge]] [[force|force fields]]_ 

* as well as [[sections]] of [[associated bundles]] -- called _[[matter fields]]_.

Similar differential geometric structures are involved in the _[[geometric quantization]]_ of such an [[action functional]] to an actual [[quantum field theory]].

Hence there is a sequence:

| [[differential geometry]] | $\to$ | [[geometric quantization]] | $\to$ | [[quantum field theory]] |
|--|--|--|--|--|

We discuss a formalization of central aspects of this entire sequence.
Our development proceeds -- as befits a theory of physics and hence of nature -- via _[[natural deduction]]_ from _[[practical foundation of mathematics|practical foundations]]_.

$\,$



Fundamentally, a [[metalanguage|language]] for [[physics]] is to be a language about _existence_; a language in which we can express [[judgements]] of the form:

> There is a thing $x$ of type $X$.

For instance:

> There is a [[gauge field]] $\nabla$ in the [[standard model of particle physics|standard model]] $[X,\mathbf{B}\left(U\left(1\right)\times SU\left(2\right)\times SU\left(3\right)\right)_{conn}]$ of gauge fields on [[spacetime]] $X$.

(Here the square bracket expression for a _[[moduli stack]]_ of gauge fields will be incrementally explained in the following.)

To be predictive, a [[metalanguage|language]] for physics is moreover to be a language in which we can make [[natural deduction|natural deductions]] to [[deductive reasoning|deduce]] further such [[judgements]] from given ones. For instance:

> Given a gauge field $\nabla$ as above, there is an underlying _[[Yang-Mills instanton|instanton]] sector_, $UnderlyingBundle(\nabla)$, in the collection $\left[X,\mathbf{B}\left(U\left(1\right)\times SU\left(2\right)\times SU\left(3\right)\right)\right]$ of instanton configurations in the standard model.

Quantum [[superpositions]] of such [[Yang-Mills instantons]] are the very substrate out of which the [[vacuum]] of the [[observable universe|observed world]] is build: the _[[instanton liquid in quantum chromodynamics]]_. (For more see at _[Yang-Mills theory](#Yang-MillsTheory)_ below.) We consider here a language to reason about such phenomena formally.

The [[metalanguage|formal language]] for such _[[natural deduction]]_ of _[[judgements]]_ about there being [[terms]] of some [[type]] is called _[[type theory]]_.

In order to describe a structured reality, our language needs to be able to speak about _comparison_ of things. 

Fundamental physics rests on the _[[gauge theory|gauge principle]]_: it is meaningless to say that two  things -- such as two [[gauge fields]] $\nabla$ as above -- are  _[[equality|equal]]_; instead they are _gauge [[equivalence|equivalent]]_ if there is a _[[gauge transformation]]_ between them. 

So our language needs to express [[judgements]] of the form:

> There is a [[gauge transformation|gauge]] [[equivalence]] between [[gauge fields]] $\nabla_1$ and $\nabla_2$.

And the language needs to be able to make [[natural deduction|natural deductions]] from such judgements to arrive at:

> Given an [[equivalence]] $\lambda \colon \nabla_1 \simeq \nabla_2 $  there is an equivalence $UnderlyingBundle(\lambda) \colon UnderlyingBundle(\nabla_1) \simeq UnderlyingBundle(\nabla_2)$ between the underlying [[Yang-Mills instanton|instanton sectors]].

The [[metalanguage|formal language]] based of the [[dependent type theory|dependent]] [[type theory]] which we have so far that contains these statements is _type theory with [[propositional equality]]_. In this language we have [[judgements]] such as the following.

**Expressions in [[dependent type theory|dependent]] [[type theory]] with [[propositional equality]]**:

| ordinary language | [[syntax]] | [[semantics]] | [[model]] | chapter |
|--|--|--|--|--|
|  | [[general abstract]] | [[general concrete]] | [[concrete particular]] | |
| Given $x,x'$, there is the collection of equivalences between $x$ and $x'$ equivalent. | $x,x' \colon X \;\vdash \; \left(x \simeq x'\right) \colon Type$. | The [[mapping cocone]] [[object]] $\array{ P_{x,x'} X &\to& * \\ \downarrow &\swArrow_{e}& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{x}} \\ * &\stackrel{x'}{\to} & X }$ | The [[smooth infinity-groupoid|moduli stack]] of [[gauge transformations]] between $x$ and $x'$. | _[Identity types](#IdentityTypes)_ |
| There is an equivalence $e$ between $x$ and $x'$. | $\array{\vdash \; e \colon (x \simeq x') \\ or \\ \vdash \; e \colon (x \rightsquigarrow x') }$ | An [[element]] of  the [[mapping cocone]] object. | A [[gauge transformation]] between $x$ and $x'$. |  |
| Given $x,x'$, there is the collection of proofs that it is true that $x$ and $x'$ are equivalent. | $x,x' \colon X \;\vdash \; [x \simeq x'] \colon Type$. | The [[truncated object of an (infinity,1)-topos|(-1)-truncation]] fo the [[mapping cocone]]. | The [[smooth space]] of [[equivalence classes]] of [[gauge transformations]] from $x$ to $x'$. | |

But the _[[gauge theory|gauge principle]]_ reaches deeper: [[gauge transformations]] themselves are subject to the gauge principle. 

In general it is meaningless to ask if two gauge transformations are equal, but we may ask if there is a _[[higher gauge theory|higher gauge transformation]]_ that transforms one gauge transformation into the other. In the physics literature such _[[gauge-of-gauge transformations]]_ are best known in their incarnation as _[[ghost-of-ghost fields]]_ in what is called the _[[BRST complex]]_ of the given [[gauge theory]]. 

Careful analysis for instance of the _[[Dirac charge quantization]]_ of _[[magnetic charge]]_ shows that already quite mundane physical phenomena exhibit such [[higher gauge transformations]]. But more famously they are known to arise in various guises in _[[string theory]]_, which is a hypothetical refinement of the [[standard model of particle physics]] and [[gravity]].

In either case, our [[metalanguage|formal language]] should not allow the [[natural deduction|deduction]] that gauge [[equivalences]] are themselves either [[equality|equal]] or not, but only allow [[judgements]] of the following form:

> There is a [[higher gauge transformation|gauge-of-gauge equivalence]] $\rho \colon (\lambda_1 \simeq \lambda_2)$ between two given [[gauge equivalences]] $\lambda_1, \lambda_2 \colon (\nabla_1 \simeq \nabla_2)$ between two given [[gauge fields]] $\nabla_1, \nabla_2$.

The flavor of [[type theory]] with [[propositional equality]] for which this is the case is called _[[intensional type theory]]_.

Since therefore a [[type]] $X$ in intensional type theory may contain [[homotopies]] between its [[terms]] of arbitrary order, we call it a _[[homotopy type]]_. 

The homotopy-type nature of the type of gauge connections $[X,\mathbf{B}G_{conn}]$ is most familiar in the physics literature in its [[infinity-Lie theory|infinitesimal approximation]], which is the (off-shell) _[[BRST complex]]_ of the gauge theory: the $n$-fold [[ghost-of-ghost fields]] in the BRST complex correspond to the $n$-fold [[homotopies]] in $[X, \mathbf{B}G_{conn}]$.

In particular, in [[intensional type theory]] we find the [[gauge group]] of a homotopy type, as indicated in the following table.

**Expressions in [[intensional type theory]]**:

| ordinary language | [[syntax]] | [[semantics]] | [[model]] | chapter |
|--|--|--|--|--|
|  | [[general abstract]] | [[general concrete]] | [[concrete particular]] | |
| Given a type $X$, there is (the underlying space) of a group $G$ of ways that $X$ is equivalent to itself. | $X \colon Type \;\vdash \; (X \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} X ) \colon Type $ | A [[loop space object]] $ \array{ G &\to& * \\ \downarrow &\swArrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{X}} \\ * &\stackrel{X}{\to} & Type }  $ | A [[∞-group|smooth ∞-group]]. | _[n-groups](#NGroups)_ |
| Given a function between collections of things $X$ and $Y$, and given a thing $y$, there is its preimage-up-to-equivalence. | $\left( f \colon \left(X\to Y\right)\right), \left(y \colon Y\right) \;\vdash\; \sum_{x \colon X} \left(f\left(x\right) \simeq y\right) $ | A  [[(infinity,1)-pullback|homotopy pullback]] $\array{ X \times_{Y} \{y \} &\to& X \\ \downarrow &\swArrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}} \\ {*} &\underset{y}{\to}&  Y } $  | The [[homotopy fiber]] of a [[homomorphism]] of [[smooth infinity-stack|smooth moduli stacks]]. | |

Suppose then that we have such a map between collections of gauge fields 

$$
  f \colon [X, \mathbf{B}G_{conn}] \to [Y, \mathbf{B}H_{conn}]
$$ 

on two possibly different [[spacetimes]] with two possibly different [[gauge groups]]. 

(For instance we might be looking at _[[Montonen-Olive duality]]_/_[[S-duality]]_ or _[[Seiberg duality]]_ of [[super Yang-Mills theory]].) 

Then we should call $f$ an [[equivalence]] - in the physics literature often: a _[[duality in physics|duality]]_ -- if, while not necessarily being a "[[bijection]]", it is such that the preimage $\phi^{-1}(\nabla) \in [X,\mathbf{B}G_{conn}]$ of a gauge field $\nabla \in [Y, \mathbf{B}H_{conn}]$ consists of gauge fields that are all gauge equivalent to each other, with the gauge equivalences exhibiting this equivalence themselves all being gauge equivalent to each other, etc. 

If this is the case one says that all [[homotopy fibers]] -- _all gauge pre-images_ -- of $\phi$ are [[contractible]] -- are _gauge equivalent to a single gauge field_ -- and that $\phi$ is a _[[weak homotopy equivalence]]_.

For consistency we should demand that the notion of equivalence is such that the space of direct equivalences 
$[X, \mathbf{B}G_{conn}] \simeq [Y, \mathbf{B}H_{conn}]$ is itself equivalent to the space of such  weak homotopy equivalences ("[[duality in physics|dualities]]") $[X, \mathbf{B}G_{conn}] \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} [Y, \mathbf{B}H_{conn}]$. 

This requirement is called the _[[univalence]] [[axiom]]_. 
The [[intensional type theory]]-language considered so far equipped with this axiom is called _[[homotopy type theory]]_.

We indicate now some central judgements that are expressible in homotopy type theory. This involves fundamental judgements in _[[group theory]]_ and in _[[representation theory]]_, two of the pillars of modern [[quantum theory]]/[[quantum field theory]].

In [[gauge theory]] physics, a [[representation]] $\rho$ of the [[gauge group]] $G$ encodes the [[particle]]-content of the [[model (in theoretical physics)]]: a [[section]] of the $\rho$-[[associated bundle]] to the gauge bundle is a _[[matter field]]_ in the [[model (in theoretical physics)|model]]. 

Therefore all the ingredients so far encode the _[[kinematics]]_ of gauge theory, its setup before an actual _[[dynamics]]_ is specified.

Dynamics in physics says how things _move_, hence how they trace out [[trajectories]] in a given [[spacetime]] or more generally in some [[phase space]].

Our [[metalanguage|language]] for reasoning about physics should be able to express this. For $X$ a homotopy type that models [[spacetime]] (the collection of all points of spacetime) there should be a homotopy type $\Pi(X)$ whose [[homotopies]] and higher homotopies are the _smooth trajectories_, the _[[path groupoid|smooth paths]]_ and higher paths in $X$. 

In order to analyse the notion of _smoothness_ here -- we will say: the way that points hold together by _[[cohesion]]_ -- there should also be 

* an expression $\flat X$ for the [[discrete space|discrete]] collection of points underlying $X$ -- **detaching** all points;

*  an expression $\sharp X$ which **dissolves** the cohesion and produces the [[codiscrete object|codiscrete]] smooth structure on $X$.

There are some natural simple [[axioms]] on these constructions. For instance every smooth path in a discrete space $\flat X$ should be constant:  $\Pi (\flat X) \simeq \flat X$.

With such natural axioms understood, these three constructions constitute an [[adjoint triple]] of _[[modal logic|modalities]]_ $(\Pi \dashv \flat \dashv \sharp)$ in our language. 
In particular $\Pi$ and $\flat$ are a _[[monad]]_ and _[[comonad]]_ on the type system, _[[monad (in computer science)|in the sense of computer science]]_ and $\sharp$ is even an internal monad.

Equipping the above _[[homotopy type theory]]_ with these [[modal logic|modalities]] turns it into what we call _[[cohesive homotopy type theory]]_.

Adding the [[modal logic|modalities]] $(\Pi \dashv \flat \dashv \sharp)$ to the above language of [[homotopy type theory]] yields a language that we call _[[cohesive homotopy type theory]]_ (following a term introduced by [[Bill Lawvere|Lawvere]]).

Fundamental [[judgements]] in [[cohesive homotopy type theory]] include those indicated in the following table, which capture central concepts of [[gauge theory]] and its ([[higher geometric quantization|higher]]) [[geometric quantization]].

Finally, in order to be able to concretely speak about not just about any gauge field, but the [[concrete particular]] gauge fields in the [[observable universe]], our language should be able to express the existence of the _[[continuum]] [[real line]]_.

This then induces the existence of the [[circle group]] $U(1) = \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$. The [[electromagnetic field]] is a [[gauge field]] for [[gauge group]] $U(1)$. Therefore in the language of cohesive homotopy type theory we can say

## **Physics in Higher Geometry: Motivation and Survey**
 {#PhysicsMotivationAndSurvey}

Before we discuss technical details starting in the [next chapter](#Fields) here we survey general ideas of [[theory (physics)|theories]] in fundamental [[physics]] and motivate how these are naturally formulated in terms of the [[higher geometry]] that we developed in the [first part](#GEOMETRY).

This chapter is at _[[geometry of physics -- physics in higher geometry]]_.

## **Equations of motion**
 {#EquationsOfMotion}
 
Above in _[Lagrangians and Action functionals](#LagrangiansAndActionFunctionals)_ we discussed [[prequantum field theory]]. Given such there are two directions to go: to the corresponding _[[classical field theory]]_ and to a corresponding _[[quantum field theory]]_.

The classical field theory is the study of the _[[critical locus]]_ of the [[action functional]], whose points are the solutions to the _([[Euler-Lagrange equations|Euler-Lagrange]]-)[[equations of motion]]_ of the system, the conditions which characterize those [[field (physics)|field configurations]] that are "physically realized" as asserted by the [[physical theory]] that is encoded by the [[action functional]]. If the [[action functional]] comes from a [[local Lagrangian]] then this space carries a canonical [[presymplectic form]] and equipped with this form it is called the _[[covariant phase space]]_ of the system.

(The term "classical" originates from the time when [[quantum mechanics]] was discovered at the beginning of the 20th century. All of the physics that was known until the end of the 19th centure was then called "classical" to distinguish it from the new refinement to [[quantum theory]]. Nowadays the term has, strictly speaking, lost its original sense, since nowadays quantum theory is entirely "classical", but "classical physics" will forever refer to non-quantum physics. )

Here we first discuss the traditional theory of classical equations of motion. Maybe the archetypical example is the [[geodesic equation]] which describes the [[trajectories]] of [[particles]] and of [[light]]. Standard examples of [[equations of motion]] for [[spacetime]] [[force]] [[field (physics)|fields]] are _[[Maxwell equations]]_ and _[[Einstein equations]]_, describing the classical [[dynamics]] of the [[electromagnetic field]] and [[gravity]], respectively.

Then we reformulate this more abstractly in [[higher geometry]]. This yields a notion of _[[derived critical loci]]_ of action functionals for which the _[[BV-BRST formalism]]_ is a model, a traditional machinery for handling [[covariant phase spaces]] while taking care of [[gauge symmetry]] and resolving singularities in the critical locus. 

Moreover, we discuss how, when interpreted in _[[extended prequantum field theory]]_, the equations of motion are just the [[codimension]]-0 piece of a tower of notions which in codimension 1 is the notion of _[[Lagrangian submanifolds]]_ of [[phase space]].

#### Critical loci


We now discuss the general abstract formulation of [[critical loci]] of [[action functionals]] in the context of a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]]. This generalizes the traditional formulation to critical loci inside higher [[moduli ∞-stacks]] of field configuration. In particular, if the ambient [[(∞,1)-topos]] is not [[n-localic (infinity,1)-topos|1-localic]], then this gives a general abstract formulation of _[[derived critical loci]]_.

Let $\mathbf{H}$ be a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] $(\mathbf{\Pi} \dashv \flat \dashv \sharp) : \mathbf{H} \to \mathbf{H}$ equipped with [[differential cohesion]] $(Red \dashv \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf} \dashv \flat_{inf}) \;\colon\; \mathbf{H} \to \mathbf{H}$. 
We discuss the formalization of [[critical loci]] of [[action functionals]] and of [[equations of motion]] in this context.

###### Definition

For $\Sigma \in Mfd_{bdr} \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H}$ a [[manifold with boundary]] in $\mathbf{H}$, def. \ref{ManifoldWithBoundaryInSemLayer}, write $[\Sigma,\mathbf{Fields}]_{\partial \Sigma} \in \mathbf{H}$ for the [[(∞,1)-pullback]]

    \\
    [\Sigma, \mathbf{Fields}]
    &\to&
    [\partial \Sigma, \mathbf{Fields}]
  }
  \,,
$$

where the right vertical morphism is the [[unit of a monad|counit]] of $\flat$ and where the bottom morphism is the image of the [[boundary]] inclusion $\partial \Sigma \to \Sigma$ under the [[internal hom]] $[-, \mathbf{Fields}]$.

###### Rermark

This implies that for any geometrically contractible $U \in \mathbf{H}$, def. \ref{ShapeTerminology}, then we have

$$
  \mathbf{H}(U, [\Sigma, \mathbf{Fields}_{\partial \Sigma}])
  \simeq
  \mathbf{Fields}(\Sigma \times U)
  \underset{\mathbf{Fields}((\partial \Sigma) \times U)}{\times}
  \mathbf{Field}(\partial \Sigma)
  \,.
$$

This means that a variation in $[\Sigma, \mathbf{Fields}]_{\partial \Sigma}$ is a variation in $[\Sigma, \mathbf{Fields}]$ which remains constant over the boundary of $\Sigma$.

In $\mathbf{H} = $ [[Smooth∞Grpd]] the standard choice is $\mathbb{G} = U(1)$, the [[circle group]], for "exponentiated action functionals" or $\mathbb{R} = \mathbb{R}$, the additive Lie group of [[real numbers]].



+-- {: .num_defn #VariationalDerivativeInCohesiveInfinityTopos}
###### Definition

For $S \;\colon\; [\Sigma, \mathbf{Fields}] \to \mathbb{G}$ a map, the **[[variational derivative]]** of $S$ is the restriction of the [[de Rham differential]] $S^{-1}\mathbf{d}S$ of def. \ref{DifferentiationOfInfinityGroupValuedFunction} to variations that keep the boundary data fixed as in def. \ref{VariationFixedOnBoundary}, hence the composite

$$
  S^{-1}\mathbf{d}_{var} S
  \;\colon\;
  [\Sigma, \mathbf{Fields}]_{\partial \Sigma}
  \to
  [\Sigma, \mathbf{Fields}]
  \stackrel{S}{\to}
  \mathbb{G}
  \stackrel{\theta_{\mathbb{G}}}{\to}
  \flat_{dR}\mathbf{B}\mathbb{G}
  \,.
$$

Since the variational context is clear from the domain of the map, we will often just write $S^{-1} \mathbf{d} S$ for $S^{-1} \mathbf{d}_{var} S$, for convenience.

###### Remark

Under coreflection into [[structure sheaves]], def. \ref{StructureSheafInPetitTopos}, this induces a map

$$
  S^{-1}\mathbf{d}_{var} S
  \;\colon\;
  [\Sigma, \mathbf{Fields}]_{\partial \Sigma}
  \to 
  \mathcal{O}_{\Sigma}(\flat_{dR} \mathbf{B}G)
$$

in $Sh_{\mathbf{H}}(X)$,
which we will denote by the same symbol, as here, when the context is clear.
Since $\mathcal{O}_X(\flat_{dR} \mathbf{B}\mathbb{G})$ has the interpretation of the _sheaf of flat $Lie(\mathbb{G})$-valued forms_ on $X$, this may be thought of as realizing $\mathbf{d} S$ as a [[section]] of the [[tangent bundle]] over $X$.

###### Remark

In [[extended prequantum field theory]] we may, as discussed in _[Lagrangians and Action functionals](#LagrangiansAndActionFunctionals)_, think of the [[action functional]] $S$ as being the [[prequantum 0-bundle]]. In this perspective the variational derivative $S^{-1} \mathbf{d}_{var} S$ of def. \ref{VariationalDerivativeInCohesiveInfinityTopos} is the [[curvature]] of this 0-bundle. If $\mathbb{G}$ is a 1-group such as $U(1)$ then this is a [[differential 1-form]] which is the _[[n-plectic geometry|0-plectic]]_ form. This means that the [[critical locus]] in def. \ref{CriticalLocusInCohesiveInfinityTopos} the maximal subspace on which the 0-plectic 1-form vanishes.

### Syntax layer
 {#EquationsOfMotionSyntaxLayer}




As the notation above suggests, the [[critical locus]] of 
the [[function]] $S\;\colon\; [X, \mathbf{Fields}] \to \mathbb{G}$ is syntactically
indeed the [[dependent sum]] over the type of fields
of the [[identity type]] of the variational derivative 
$S^{-1}\mathbf{d} S \in Sh_{\mathbf{H}}(X)$ and the 0-term in
$Sh_{\mathbf{H}}(X)$. This is indeed the standard expression in 
[[type theory]] which formalizes the variations equation of motion:

"The collection of fields for which the variational derivative equals zero." translates exactly into $\underset{\phi \in [X, \mathbf{Fields}]}{\sum} (S^{-1}\mathbf{d}S \simeq 0)$.

## **Application to open questions in physics**
 {#ApplicationsToOpenQuestionsInPhysics}

What is it that [[higher geometry]], [[higher gauge theory]], [[extended TQFT|extended]]/local [[field theory]] and generally [[higher category theory and physics|higher category theory in physics]] contribute to open research questions in theoretical physics?

Often when this question is asked the most glaring open question of contemporary theoretical physics is forgotten: 

_What IS [[local quantum field theory]]?_ 

While something going by this name is clearly in use, it is just as clear that the full answer to this question is only being discovered these days, with formalizations such as the [[cobordism theorem]] and constructions such as [[factorization algebras]] in [[BV-quantization]] -- both of which are crucially constructions in [[higher geometry]]/[[higher category theory]].

Despite the huge success of quantum field theory, it it worthwhile to remember that all the fundamental open questions in present day fundamental physics quite likely require a deeper understanding of what quantum field theory actually is, notably non-perturbatively:

* Why is there [[confinement]]/[[chiral symmetry breaking]] in non-perturbative [[QCD]]/[[Yang-Mills theory]]? (The "mass gap problem".)

* What is beyond-the-standard-model physics?

* What is [[quantum gravity]]?

* What is non-perturbative [[string theory]]?

For instance the [[standard model of cosmology]] says that the bulk of all [[energy]] and [[matter]] in the [[observable universe]] is entirely unknown to us ([[dark matter]], "[[dark energy]]"), while at the same time the theoretical prediction what the [[cosmological constant]] [[vacuum energy]] should be is entirely off. How glaring an open question about the nature of quantum field theory this actually is is often forgotten due to the success of [[effective field theory]]-type of reasoning that allows to neatly wrap up all this unknown energy into a single term in some effective equation. Phenomenologically this may be regarded as a success, but for fundamental theoretical physics it is a glaring open question. 

And while there is work going in this direction, it may be worthwhile to recall how relatively primitive the available theoretical tools often still are. For instance it seems clear that "canonical non-covariant quantization" can hardly be an approrpiate tool to approach anything in the direction of [[quantum gravity]]. Even so fundamental a notion as that of _[[covariant phase space]]_ necessary to make progress here is not widely known in the theoretical physics community. Attempts to refine quantization to a "covariant" and "[[local quantum field theory|local]]" formalism via [[multisymplectic geometry]] have mainly got stuck, since local observables just do not form a sensible structure in ordinary [[Lie theory]]. This is resolved only in [[infinity-Lie theory]] and [[higher differential geometry]], as discussed above ([hgp 13](#hgp13), [lo 13](#LocalObservables13)).

If one assumes that [[string theory]] is part of the answer as to what underlies the [[standard model of particle physics]] [[standard model of cosmology|and cosmology]], then this situation becomes more drastic even. The fundamental [[field (physics)|fields]] of string theory are clearly objects in [[higher differential geometry]], such as the [[B-field]], the [[RR-field]], the [[supergravity C-field]] etc. For instance the natural identification of the latter as a [[homotopy fiber product]] of [[moduli stacks]] in ([FSS7dCS](#FSS7dCS), [FSSCField](#FSSCField)) is hardly conceivable when ignoring [[higher differential geometry]]. And this is a structure meant to be at the very heart of what makes up string theory. It is unlikely that the [[landscape of string theory vacua]] and hence the relation of string theory to [[phenomenology]] can really be understood if such basic higher-geometric phenomena of string theory are ignored (see [Distler-Freed-Moore 09](#http://ncatlab.org/schreiber/show/Mathematical+Foundations+of+Quantum+Field+and+Perturbative+String+Theory#ContributionDistlerFreedMoore) on this point).

### Topos theory in differential geometry and physics
 {#ReferencesToposTheory}

One of the central figures of [[topos theory]] and [[categorical logic]], [[William Lawvere]], has motivated his interest in these subject always with intended application to the formalization of [[physics]] (of [[classical mechanics|classical]] [[continuum mechanics]] in his case). 

An influential text is

* [[William Lawvere]], _Toposes of laws of notion_, Toposes of laws of motion , transcript of a talk in Montreal, Sept. 1997 ([pdf](http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~wlawvere/ToposMotion.pdf))

which motivates [[synthetic differential geometry]] from [[differential equations]] appearing as [[equations of motion]] in physics. The early text

* [[William Lawvere]], _[[Some Thoughts on the Future of Category Theory]]_ in A. Carboni, M. Pedicchio, G. Rosolini, _Category Theory_  , [[Como|Proceedings of the International Conference held in Como]], Lecture Notes in Mathematics 1488, Springer (1991)

already sketches the formulation of [[cohesive toposes]] and motivates their axioms with heuristics from geometry and physics.

A review by Lawvere is in 

* [[William Lawvere]], _Comments on the Development of Topos Theory_, Development of Mathematics 1950-2000, 715-734 (2000) Birkhäuser Basel

### Higher category theory in physics

* [[Daniel Freed]], _[[Higher Algebraic Structures and Quantization]]_

The full formalization of this for [[extended topological field theory]] is due to 

* [[Jacob Lurie]], _[[On the Classification of Topological Field Theories]]_

Related comments on the extended [[quantization]] of [[infinity-Dijkgraaf-Witten theory]] are in

### Local prequantum field theory
 {#ReferencesLocalPrequantumFieldTheory}

* [[Urs Schreiber]], _[[schreiber:Nonabelian cocycles and their quantum symmetries]]_ (2008)

A formulation of the idea for [[Dijkgraaf-Witten theory]]-type field theories is indicated in section 3 of 

* [[Daniel Freed]], [[Michael Hopkins]], [[Jacob Lurie]], [[Constantin Teleman]], _[[Topological Quantum Field Theories from Compact Lie Groups]]_ (2010)
 {#FHLT}

based on the considerations in section 3.2 of 

* [[Jacob Lurie]], _[[On the Classification of Topological Field Theories]]_ (2009).
 {#LurieTFT}

Based on the general formulation of the more general [[QFT with defects|field theory with defects]] described in section 4.3 there, in

* [[Domenico Fiorenza]], [[Alessandro Valentino]], _Boundary conditions in local TFTs_ (in preparation)
 {#FiorenzaValentino}

the structure of such [[domain walls]]/defects/[[branes]] are analyzed in the prequantum theory, hence with coefficients in an [[(∞,n)-category of spans]].

The study of local prequantum [[schreiber:∞-Chern-Simons theory]] with its codimension-1 [[schreiber:∞-Wess-Zumino-Witten theory]] and codimension 2-[[Wilson line]]-theory in this fashion, in an ambient [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] is discussed in ([lpqft](#lpqft))
