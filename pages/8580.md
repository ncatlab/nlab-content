## About this page

This page is going to contain an introduction to aspects of [[differential geometry]] and their application in fundamental [[physics]]: the [[gauge theory]] appearing in the [[standard model of particle physics]] and the [[Riemannian geometry]] appearing in the [[standard model of cosmology]], as well as the [[symplectic geometry]] appearing in the [[quantization]] of both.

### Scope and perspective

The intended topic scope and readership of the first layer of this page -- the _[Mod Layer](#LayerMod)_ --  is much like that of the book ([Frankel](#Frankel)), only that here we make use of a more modern and more transparent conceptual toolbox and discuss in two other layers, the _[Sem Layer](#LayerSem)_ and the _[Syn Layer](#LayerSyn)_ the deeper mechanisms at work in the background.

For instance where traditionally expositions of [[differential geometry]] proceed by generalizing the [[geometry]] of abstract [[coordinate|coordinate systems]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ to _[[smooth manifolds]]_, here we instead begin by generalizing, in the _[Mod layer](#LayerMod)_, coordinate systems right away to _[[smooth spaces]]_, which happens to be both more expressive as well as actually much easier. In parallel (and to be read independently or not at all) we discuss in the  [Sem layer](#LayerSem) how this means that we are working in the _[[sheaf topos]]_ over abstract coordinate systems.  Smooth manifolds are then introduced later as an intermediate notion, together with that of _[[diffeological spaces]]_. (Many of the constructions in [[differential geometry]] applied in [[physics]] do not actually need the notion of a smooth manifold, and, more importantly, for many notions in modern theoretical physics smooth manifolds are not actually sufficiently general.) 

In fact we introduce smooth manifolds only after we introduce _[[smooth groupoids]]_, which are differential geometric structures that are _still_ simpler than smooth manifolds, and of course even more expressive than smooth spaces. In fact, smooth groupoids are the very heart of the geometry of physics. Modern fundamental physics is all based on the "[[gauge symmetry|gauge principle]]" and in the [Mod Layer](#LayerMod) we explain how, mathematically, this is essentially nothing but the theory of smooth groupoids. As further background information we discuss in the [Sem Layer](#LayerSem) how this means that we are working in a [[(infinity,1)-topos|higher topos]] over abstract coordinate systems, and in the [Syn Layer](#LayerSyn) how this means that we are reasoning about physics using the _[[natural deduction]]_ rules of _[[homotopy type theory]]_.

### Layers of exposition
 {#Layers}

We discuss each topic below in three stages, in three _layers_. 

1. The first layer, called **Layer Mod**, deals with concrete explicit  constructions as familiar from traditional textbooks on differential geometry and physics. This layer is supposed to be readable and useful all in itself and the reader who feels that this is all he or she wants to see can stick to this and ignore the other layers. In particular, while _Layer Mod_ does invoke the basic notion of a _[[category]]_ and of a _[[functor]]_ -- which are as simple as the notions of [[group]] or [[associative algebra|algebra]] --, it does not use any actual _[[category theory]]_. 
 {#LayerMod}

1. The second layer, called **Layer Sem**, makes explicit the ([[(infinity,1)-category theory|higher]]) [[category theory]] and ([[(infinity,1)-topos theory|higher]]) [[topos theory]] at work in the background. This puts the concrete constructions of _Layer Mod_ into a more general context and helps to see certain organizational patterns that underly the seemingly different phenomena. It provides some powerful theorems which _Layer Mod_ is secretly benefitting from. For instance this layer gives a systematic rule for generalizing everything at the beginning in _Layer Mod_ from ordinary [[differential geometry]] to what is called  _[[supergeometry]]_, which is the context in which [[fermion|fermionic]] [[particles]] are formalized: the [[matter]] constituents of the [[observable universe]].
 {#LayerSem}

1. The third layer, called **Layer Syn**, makes explicit the expression of these phenomena in the [[logical framework|formal]] [[internal language]] of the [[topos]] of [[smooth spaces]] -- which is _[[dependent type theory|dependent]] [[type theory]]_ -- and of the [[(infinity,1)-topos|higher topos]] of [[smooth infinity-groupoid|smooth higher groupoids]] -- which is _[[homotopy type theory]]_. This makes more transparent various constructions in ([[(infinity,1)-topos theory|higher]]) [[topos theory]] used in _Layer Sem_, and in fact it provides 
a [[categorical semantics|natural construction principle]] for objects in a (higher) topos that model some intended _meaning_, which is precisely what [[mathematical physics]] is about.
This is meant for readers who enjoy seeing fundamental physics _naturally_ rooted in genuinely fundamental mathematics, in _[[natural deduction]]_, as it were. Everybody else should ignore this.
 {#LayerSyn}
 
**The three layers**

* **Layer Mod** -- [[concrete particular]]: [[models]]

* **Layer Sem** -- [[concrete general]]: [[categorical semantics]] in [[(infinity,1)-topos theory|higher]] [[topos theory]]

* **Layer Syn** -- [[abstract general]]: [[syntax]] in [[homotopy type theory|homotopy]]-[[type theory]]


### Tabulated index
 {#TabulatedIndex}


The following table provides an index to some central themes of the following notes. Whereas the exposition below is organized to start each topic with the discussion of its concrete [[models]] in a [Mod Layer](#LayerMod), then pass to a general abstract semantics and then to the abstract formal syntax in a [Syn Layer](#LayerMod), this table indicates how this passage to abstract syntax usefully reflects back onto the concrete theory: 

The leftmost column of the table formulates concepts in terms of ordinary language. The second column translates that ordinary language fairly directly to formal syntax of [[type theory]]. The third column then interprets this formal syntax semantically as a construction in the ([[(infinity,1)-topos|higher]]) [[topos]] [[smooth spaces]] ([[smooth ∞-groupoids]]) by the rules of [[categorical semantics]]. The fourth colum finally indicates which explicit models realize these constructions. 

We find that fairly evident and na&iuml;ve sounding statements in ordinary language turn under this translation into what is generally regarded as fairly sophisticated constructions. So this table also serves to show how the general abstract discussion here is not just a means in itself. It is instead a means that helps to reason about complicated aspects of reality.

## **Coordinate systems**
 {#CoordinateSystems}

Every kind of _[[geometry]]_ is modeled on a collection of [[generator|archetypical]] basic [[spaces]] and geometric [[homomorphisms]] between them. In [[differential geometry]] the archetypical spaces are the abstract standard [[Cartesian space|Cartesian coordinate systems]], denoted $\mathbb{R}^n$, in every [[dimension]] $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and the geometric homomorphism between them are [[smooth functions]] $\mathbb{R}^{n_1} \to \mathbb{R}^{n_1}$, hence smooth (and possibly degenerate) [[coordinate transformations]].

Here we discuss the central aspects of the nature of such abstract coordinate systems in themselves. At this point these are not yet coordinate systems _on_ some other space. That is instead the topic of the next section _[Smooth spaces](#SmoothSpaces)_.

### Layer Mod
 {#CoordinateSystemsLayerMod}

In this [Mod Layer ](#LayerMod) we discuss the [[concrete particulars]] of _[[coordinate systems]]_: the [[continuum]] [[real line]] $\mathbb{R}$, the [[Cartesian spaces]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ formed from it and the [[smooth functions]] between these.

#### The continuum real (world-)line
 {#TheContinuumRealWorldLine}

The fundamental premise of [[differential geometry]] as a model of [[geometry]] in [[physics]] is the following.

**Premise.** _The abstract [[worldline]] of any [[particle]] is modeled by the [[continuum]] [[real line]] $\mathbb{R}$._

This comes down to the following sequence of premises.

1. There is a [[linear ordering]] of the [[points]] on a [[worldline]]: in particular if we pick points at some intervals on the worldline we may label these in an order-preserving way by [[integers]]

   $\mathbb{Z}$.

1. These intervals may each be subdivided into $n$ smaller intervals, for each natural number $n$. Hence we may label points on the [[worldline]] in an order-preserving way by the [[rational numbers]]

   $\mathbb{Q}$.

1. This labeling is dense: every point on the worldline is the [[supremum]] of an [[inhabited set|inhabited]] [[bounded subset]] of such labels. This means that a [[worldline]] [[equivalence|is]] the _[[real line]]_, the [[continuum]] of [[real numbers]]

   $\mathbb{R}$.
  
The adjective "real" in "[[real number]]" is a historical shadow of the old idea that real numbers are related to _observed reality_, hence to [[physics]] in this way. The experimental success of this assumption shows that it is valid at least to very good approximation. 

Speculations are common that in a fully exact theory of [[quantum gravity]], currently unavailable, this assumption needs to be refined. 
For instance in _[[p-adic physics]]_ one explores the hypothesis that the relevant [[complete field|completion]] of the rational numbers as above is not the reals, but [[p-adic numbers]] $\mathbb{Q}_p$ for some [[prime number]] $p \in \mathbb{N}$. Or for example in the study of [[QFT on non-commutative spacetime]] one explore the idea that at small scales the smooth [[continuum]] is to be replaced by an object in [[noncommutative geometry]]. Combining these two ideas leads to the notion of [[non-commutative analytic space]] as a potential model for _[[space]]_ in [[physics]]. And so forth.

For the time being all this remains speculation and differential geometry based on the [[continuum]] [[real line]] remains the context of all fundamental [[model (in theoretical physics)|model building]] in physics related to observed [[phenomenology]]. Often it is argued that these speculations are necessitated by the very nature of [[quantum theory]] applied to [[gravity]]. But, at least so far, such statements are not actually supported by the standard theory of [[quantization]]:
we discuss below in _[Geometric quantization](GeometricQuantization)_ how not just [[classical physics]] but also [[quantum theory]], in the best modern version available, is entirely rooted in differential geometry based on the [[continuum]] [[real line]].

This is the motivation for studying models of physics in geometry modeled on the [[continuum]] [[real line]]. On the other hand, in all of what follows our discussion is set up such as to be _maximally independent_ of this specific choice (this is what _[[topos theory]]_ accomplishes for us, discussed below _[Smooth spaces -- Layer Sem](#SmoothSpacesLayerSem)_). If we do desire to consider another choice of archetypical spaces for the geometry of physics we can simply "change the [[site]]", as discussed [below](#SmoothSpacesLayerSem) and many of the constructions, propositions and theorems in the following will continue to hold. This is notably what we do below in _[Supergeometric coordinate systems](#SupergeometricCoordinateSystems)_ when we generalize the present discussion to a flavor of differential geometry that also formalizes the notion of [[fermion]] [[particles]]: "differential [[supergeometry]]."


#### Cartesian spaces and smooth functions
 {#CartesianSpaces}



+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A [[function]] of [[sets]] $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is called 
a **[[smooth function]]** if, [[coinduction|coinductively]]:

1. the [[derivative]] $\frac{d f}{d x} : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ exists;

1. and is itself a smooth function.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #CartesianSpaceAndHomomorphism}
###### Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the **[[Cartesian space]]** $\mathbb{R}^n$ is the set

$$
  \mathbb{R}^n = \{ (x^1 , \cdots, x^{n}) | x^i \in \mathbb{R} \}
$$

of $n$-[[tuples]] of [[real numbers]]. For $1 \leq k \leq n$ write

$$
  i^k : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^n
$$

for the [[function]] such that $i^k(x) = (0, \cdots, 0,x,0,\cdots,0)$ is the [[tuple]] whose $k$th entry is $x$ and all whose other entries are $0 \in \mathbb{R}$; and write

$$
  \mathbb{p}^k : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}
$$

for the function such that $p^k(x^1, \cdots, x^n) = x^k$.

A **[[homomorphism]]** of Cartesian spaces is a [[smooth function]]

$$
  f : \mathbb{R}^{n_1} \to \mathbb{R}^{n_2}
  \,,
$$

hence a [[function]] $f : \mathbb{R}^{n_1} \to \mathbb{R}^{n_2}$ such that all [[partial derivatives]] exist and are [[continuous map|continuous]] (...).

###### Example

Regarding $\mathbb{R}^n$ as an $\mathbb{R}$-[[vector space]], 
every [[linear function]] $\mathbb{R}^{n_1} \to \mathbb{R}^{n_2}$
is in particular a [[smooth function]].

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

But a homomorphism of Cartesian spaces in def. \ref{CartesianSpaceAndHomomorphism} is *not* required to be a [[linear map]]. We do *not* regard the Cartesian spaces here as [[vector spaces]].

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A [[smooth function]] $f : \mathbb{R}^{n_1} \to \mathbb{R}^{n_2}$ is called a **[[diffeomorphism]]** if there exists another smooth function 
$\mathbb{R}^{n_2} \to \mathbb{R}^{n_1}$ such that the underlying functions of sets are [[inverse]] to each other

$$
  f \circ g = id

and

$$

There exists a [[diffeomorphism]] $\mathbb{R}^{n_1} \to \mathbb{R}^{n_2}$ precisely if $n_1 = n_2$.

###### Definition

We will also say equivalently that

1. a [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ is an **[[coordinate system|abstract coordinate system]]**;

1. a [[smooth function]] $\mathbb{R}^{n_1} \to \mathbb{R}^{n_2}$ is an **[[coordinate transformation|abstract coordinate transformation]]**;

1. the [[function]] $p^k : \mathbb{R}^{n} \to \mathbb{R}$ is the $k$th **[[coordinate]]** of the coordinate system $\mathbb{R}^n$. We will also write this function as $x^k : \mathbb{R}^{n} \to \mathbb{R}$.

1. for $f : \mathbb{R}^{n_1} \to \mathbb{R}^{n_2}$ a [[smooth function]], and $1 \leq k \leq n_2$ we write

   1. $f^k \coloneqq p^k\circ f$

   1. $(f^1, \cdots, f^n) \coloneqq f$.

=--

###### Remark

It follows with this notation that

$$
  id_{\mathbb{R}^n} = (x^1, \cdots, x^n) : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n
  \,.
$$

Hence an abstract coordinate transformation 

$$ 
  f : \mathbb{R}^{n_1} \to \mathbb{R}^{n_2}
$$

may equivalently be written as the tuple

$$
  \left(
    f^1 \left( x^1, \cdots, x^{n_1} \right)
    ,
    \cdots,
    f^{n_2}\left( x^1, \cdots, x^{n_1} \right)
  \right)

###### Propositions

Abstract coordinate systems according to prop. \ref{CartesianSpacesAndSmoothFunctions} form a _[[category]]_ 
-- to be denoted _[[CartSp]]_ -- whose

* [[objects]] are the abstract coordinate systems $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ (the [[class]] of objects is the [[set]] $\mathbb{N}$ of [[natural numbers]] $n$);

* [[morphisms]] $f : \mathbb{R}^{n_1} \to \mathbb{R}^{n_2}$ are the abstract [[coordinate transformations]] = [[smooth functions]].

Composition of morphisms is given by [[composition]] of [[functions]].

We have that

1. The [[identity]] morphisms are precisely the identity functions.

1. The [[isomorphisms]] are precisely the [[diffeomorphisms]].

###### Definition

Write [[CartSp]]${}^{op}$ for the [[opposite category]] of [[CartSp]].

This is the category with the same objects as $CartSp$, but where a morphism $\mathbb{R}^{n_1} \to \mathbb{R}^{n_2}$ in $CartSp^{op}$ is given by a morphism $\mathbb{R}^{n_1} \leftarrow \mathbb{R}^{n_2}$ in $CartSp$.

=--

We will be discussing below the idea of exploring smooth spaces by laying out abstract coordinate systems in them in all possible ways. The reader should begin to think of the sets that appear in the following definition as the _set of ways_ of laying out a given abstract coordinate systems in a given space. This is discussed in more detail below in _[Smooth spaces](#SmoothSpaces)_.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A [[functor]]  $X : CartSp^{op} \to Set$ (a "[[presheaf]]") is

1. for each abstract coordinate system $U$ a [[set]] $X(U)$

1. for each [[coordinate transformation]] $f : \mathbb{R}^{n_1} \to \mathbb{R}^{n_2}$ a [[function]] $X(f) : X(\mathbb{R}^{n_1}) \to X(\mathbb{R}^{n_2})$

such that 

1. [[identity]] is respected $X(id_{\mathbb{R}^n}) = id_{X(\mathbb{R}^n)}$;

1. [[composition]] is respected $X(f_2)\circ X(f_1) = X(f_2 \circ f_1)$

#### The fundamental theorems about smooth functions
 {#PropertiesOfSmoothFunctions}

The special properties [[smooth functions]] that make them play an important role different from other classes of functions are the following.

1. existence of [[bump functions]] and [[partitions of unity]]

1. the [[Hadamard lemma]] and [[Borel's theorem]]

Or maybe better put: what makes smooth functions special is that the first of these properties holds, while the second is still retained.

(...)


### Layer Sem
 {#CoordinateSystemsLayerSem}

In this [Sem Layer](#LayerSem) we discuss the [[concrete general]] aspects of _abstract [[coordinate systems]]_, def. \ref{CartesianSpacesAndSmoothFunctions}: the fact that they naturally form: 

1. an _[[algebraic theory]]_, 

1. a _[[site]]_.

#### The coverage of differentially good open covers
 {#CoverageOfDifferentiallyGoodOpenCovers}

We discuss a standard structure of a _[[site]]_ on the category [[CartSp]]. Following _[[Sketches of an Elephant|Johnstone -- Sketches of an Elephant]]_, it will be useful and convenient to regard a site as a ([[small site|small]]) category equipped with a _[[coverage]]_. This generates a genuine [[Grothendieck topology]], but need not itself already be one.

###### Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the standard [[open ball|open n-ball]] is the the subset

and such for each non-empty finite [[intersection]] there exists a [[diffeomorphism]]

that identifies the $k$-fold intersection with a Cartesian space itself.

###### Proposition

Every [[open cover]] refines to a differentially good open cover, def. \ref{DifferentiallyGoodOpenCover}. 

=--

A proof is at _[[good open cover]]_. 

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Despite its appearance, this is not quite a classical statement. The classical statement is only that every open cover is refined by a _topologically_ [[good open cover]]. See the comments _[here in the references-section](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/ball#References)_ at _[[open ball]]_ for the situation concerning this statement in the literature.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

The _good_ open covers do not yet form a [[Grothendieck topology]] on [[CartSp]]. One of the axioms of a Grothendieck topology is that for every [[covering]] family also its [[pullback]] along any morphism in the category is a covering family. But while the pullback of every [[open cover]] is again an open cover, and hence open covers form a Grothendieck topology on [[CartSp]], not every pullback of a _[[good open cover|good]]_ open cover is again _good_.

=--

+-- {: .num_example #ExampleThatGoodOpenCoversAreNotPullbackStable}
###### Example

Let $\{\mathbb{R}^2\stackrel{\phi_{i}}{\hookrightarrow}\mathbb{R}^2\}_{i \in \{1,2\}}$ be the [[open cover]] of the [[plane]] by an open left half space

$$
   \mathbb{R}^2 \simeq \{ (x_1,x_2) \in \mathbb{R}^2 | x_1 \lt 1 \} \stackrel{\phi_1}{\hookrightarrow} \mathbb{R}^2
$$

and a right open half space

$$
   \mathbb{R}^2 \simeq \{ (x_1,x_2) \in \mathbb{R}^2 | x_1 \gt -1 \} \stackrel{\phi_2}{\hookrightarrow} \mathbb{R}^2
  \,.
$$

The intersection of the two is the open strip

$$
  \mathbb{R}^2 \simeq \{ (x_1, x_2) \in \mathbb{R}^2 | -1 \lt x_1 \lt 1 \}
  \hookrightarrow 
  \mathbb{R}^2
  \,.
$$

So this is a [[good open cover]] of $\mathbb{R}^2$. 

But consider then the smooth function 

$$
  2(\cos(2 \pi (-)), \sin(2 \pi (-))) \colon \mathbb{R}^1 \to \mathbb{R}^2 
$$

which sends the line to a curve in the plane that periodically goes around the [[circle]] of radius 2 in the plane. 

Then the pullback of the above good open cover on $\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\mathbb{R}^1$ along this function is an [[open cover]] of $\mathbb{R}$ by two open subsets, each being a disjoint union of countably many open [[intervals]] in $\mathbb{R}$. 
Each of these open intervals is an open 1-ball hence diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^1$, but their _[[disjoint union]]_ is not [[contractible topological space|contractible]] (it does not contract to the point, but to many points!). 

So the pullback of the good open cover that we started with is an open cover which is not _good_ anymore. But it has an evident _refinement_ by a good open cover. 

=--

This is a special case of what the following statement says in generality.

+-- {: .num_prop #TheDifferentiallyGoodOpenCoverCoverage}
###### Proposition

The differentially good open covers, def. \ref{DifferentiallyGoodOpenCover}, constitute a [[coverage]] on [[CartSp]]. 

Hence [[CartSp]] equipped with that coverage is a [[site]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By definition of [[coverage]] we need to check that for $\{U_i \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^n\}_{i \in I}$ any [[good open cover]] and $f \colon \mathbb{R}^k \to \mathbb{R}^n$ any smooth function, we can find a good open cover $\{K_j \to \mathbb{R}^k\}_{j \in J}$ and a [[function]] $J \to I$ such that for each $j \in J$ there is a smooth function $\phi \colon K_j \to U_{\rho(j)}$ that makes this [[diagram]] 
[[commuting diagram|commute]]:

$$
  \array{
    K_j &\stackrel{\phi}{\to}& U_{i(j)}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbb{R}^k &\stackrel{f}{\to}& \mathbb{R}^n
  }
  \,.
$$

To obtain this, let $\{f^* U_i \to \mathbb{R}^k\}$ be the pullback of the original covering family, in that 

$$
  f^* U_i \coloneqq \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^k | f(x) \in U_i \}
  \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^k
  \,.
$$

This is evidently an [[open cover]], albeit not necessarily a _[[good open cover]]_. But by prop. \ref{DiffGoodOpenCoversRefineOpenCovers} there does exist a good open cover $\{\tilde K_{\tilde j} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^k\}_{\tilde j \in \tilde J}$ _refining_ it, which in turn means that for all $\tilde j$ there is  

$$
  \array{
    \tilde K_{\tilde j} &\to& K_{j(\tilde j)}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow 
    \\
    \mathbb{R}^k &\stackrel{=}{\to}& \mathbb{R}^k
  }
  \,.
$$

Therefore then the [[pasting]] composite of these commuting squares 

$$
  \array{
    \tilde K_{\tilde j} &\to& K_{j(\tilde j)} &\to& U_{i(j(\tilde j))}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbb{R}^k &\stackrel{=}{\to}& \mathbb{R}^k
   &\stackrel{f}{\to}& \mathbb{R}^n
  }
$$

solves the condition required in the definition of [[coverage]].

=--

By example \ref{ExampleThatGoodOpenCoversAreNotPullbackStable} this [[good open cover]] [[coverage]] is not a [[Grothendieck topology]]. But as any coverage, it uniquely completes to one which has the same [[sheaves]].

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The [[Grothendieck topology]] induced on [[CartSp]] by the differentially good open cover coverage of def. \ref{TheDifferentiallyGoodOpenCoverCoverage} has as covering families the ordinary [[open covers]]. 

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

This means that for every sheaf-theoretic construction to follow we can just as well consider the Grothendieck topology of open covers on $CartSp$. The sheaves of the open cover topology are the same as those of the good open cover coverage. But the latter is (more) useful for several computational purposes in the following. It is the _good_ open cover coverage that makes manifest, below, that sheaves on $CartSp$ form a [[locally connected topos]] and in consequence then a [[cohesive topos]]. This kind of argument becomes all the more pronounced as we pass [further below](#SmoothnGroupoids) to [[(∞,1)-sheaves]] on [[CartSp]]. This will be discussed in _[Smooth n-groupoids -- Layer Sem -- Local Infinity-Connectedness](#InfinityConnectednessOfSmoothInfinityGrpd) below.

### Layer Syn
 {#CoordinateSystemsLayerSyn}

In this [Syn Layer](#LayerSyn) we discuss the [[abstract generals]] of _abstract [[coordinate systems]]_, def. \ref{CartesianSpacesAndSmoothFunctions}: the [[internal language]] of a category with [[products]], which is _[[type theory]]_ with _[[product types]]_.

#### Judgments about types and terms
 {#Judgments}

We now introduce a different _notation_ for [[objects]] and [[morphisms]] in a [[category]] (such as the category [[CartSp]] of def. \ref{CartSpCategory}). This notation is designed to, eventually, make more transparent what exactly it is that happens when we [[deductive reasoning|reason deductively]] about [[objects]] and [[morphisms]] of a [[category]]. 

But before we begin to make any actual [[deductions]] about [[objects]] and [[morphisms]] in a category [below](#NaturalDeductionRulesForProductTypes), in this section here we express the given objects and morphisms at hand in the first place. Such basic statements of the form "There is an object called $A$" are to be called _[[judgments]]_, in order not to confuse these with genuine _[[propositions]]_ that we eventually formalize _within_ this [[metalanguage]].

To express that there is an [[object]] 

$$
  X \in \mathcal{C}
$$ 

in a [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$, we write now equivalently the string of symbols (called a _[[sequent]]_)

$$
  \vdash \; X \colon Type
  \,.
$$

We say that these symbols express the _[[judgment]]_ that $X$ is a _[[type]]_. We also say that $\vdash \; X \colon Type$ is the _[[syntax]]_ of which $X \in \mathcal{C}$ is the _[[categorical semantics]]_.

For instance the [[terminal object]] $* \in \mathcal{C}$ we call the [[categorical semantics]] of the _[[unit type]]_ and write [[syntax|syntactically]] as

$$
  \vdash \; Unit \colon Type
  \,.
$$

If we want to express that we do assume that a terminal object indeed exists, hence that we want to be able to _[[deduction|deduce]]_ the existence of a terminal object from no hypothesis, then we write this [[judgment]] below a horizontal line

$$
  \frac{}{\vdash \; Unit \colon Type}
  \,.
$$

We will see more interesting such horizontal-line statements [below](#NaturalDeductionRulesForProductTypes).

Next, to express an [[element]] of the object $X$ in $\mathcal{C}$, hence a [[morphism]] 

$$
  * \stackrel{x}{\to} X
$$ 

in $\mathcal{C}$ we write equivalently the [[sequent]]

$$
  \vdash \; x \colon X
$$

and call this the [[judgment]] that $x$ is a _[[term]]_ of [[type]] $X$.

Notice that every object $X \in \mathcal{C}$ becomes the [[terminal object]] in the _[[slice category]]_ $\mathcal{C}_{/X}$.
Let $A \to X$ be any morphism in $\mathcal{C}$, regarded as an object in the [[slice category]]

$$
  A \in \mathcal{C}_{/X}
  \,.
$$

We declare that the [[syntax]] of which this is the [[categorical semantics]] is given by the [[sequent]]

$$
  x \colon X \;\vdash \;  A(x) \colon Type
  \,.
$$

We say that this expresses the [[judgement]] that $A$ is an  _$X$-[[dependent type]]_; or a type in the _[[context]] of a [[free variable]]_ $x$ of [[type]] $X$.

Notice that an [[element]] of $A \in \mathcal{C}_{/X}$ is a [[generalized element]] of $A$ in $\mathcal{C}$, namely a morphism $X \to A$ which fits into a [[commuting diagram]]

$$
  \array{
    X &&\stackrel{a}{\to}&& A
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{id_X}}\searrow && \swarrow_{}
    \\
    && X
  }
$$

in $\mathcal{C}$.

We declare that the [[syntax]] of which such

$$
  a \in A  \;\;\;\; (in \mathcal{C}_{/X})
$$

is this the [[categorical semantics]] is the [[sequent]]

$$
  x\colon X \;\vdash\; a(x) : A(x)
  \,.
$$

We say that this expresses the [[judgment]] that $a(x)$ is a [[term in context|term depending on]] the [[free variable]] $x$ of [[type]] $X$.

This completes the list of _[[judgment]]_ [[syntax]] to be considered. Notice that if the category $\mathcal{C}$ has [[products]] then, even though it does not explicitly appear above, this is sufficient to express any morphism $X \stackrel{f}{\to} Y$ in $\mathcal{C}$ as the [[semantics]] of a [[term]]: we regard this morphism naturally as being the corresponding morphism in the [[slice category]] $\mathcal{C}_{/X}$ which as a [[commuting diagram]] in $\mathcal{C}$ itself is

$$
  \array{
     X && \stackrel{(f,id_X)}{\to} &&  Y\times X
     \\
     & {}_{\mathllap{id_X}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{p_2}}
     \\
     && X
  }
  \,.
$$ 

This is the [[categorical semantics]] for which the [[syntax]] is simply

$$
  x \colon X \;\vdash\; y(x) \colon Y
  \,,
$$

being the [[judgment]] which expresses that $y(x)$ is a [[term in context]] of an $X$-[[dependent type]] $Y$ in the special degenerate case that $Y$ does not actually vary with $x \colon X$.



#### Natural deduction rules for product types
 {#NaturalDeductionRulesForProductTypes}

With the [above symbolic notation](#Judgments) for making [[judgments]] about the presence of [[objects]] and [[morphisms]] in a [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$, we now consider a system of rule of [[deduction]]  that tells us how we may _process_ these symbols (how to do _[[computations]]_) such that the new symbols we obtain in turn express new objects and new morphisms in $\mathcal{C}$ that we can build out of the given ones by _[[universal constructions]]_ in the sense of [[category theory]]. 

This way of _deducing_ new expressions from given ones is very basic as well as very natural and hence goes by the technical term _[[natural deduction]]_. For every kind of [[type]] (every [[universal construction]] in [[category theory]]) there is, in [[natural deduction]], one set of rules for how to [[deductive reasoning|deductively reason]] about it. This set of rules, in turn, always consists of four kinds of rules, called the

1. [[type formation rule]]

1. [[term introduction rule]]

1. [[term elimination rule]]

1. [[computation rule]].

These are going to be the [[syntax]] in _[[type theory]]_ of which [[universal constructions]] in [[category theory]] is the [[categorical semantics]].

In our running example where $\mathcal{C} = $ [[CartSp]], the only [[universal construction]] available is that of forming [[products]]. We therefore introduce now the [[natural deduction]] rules by way of example of the special case of [[product types]].

**1. [[type formation rule]]** Let 

$$
  A , B \in \mathcal{C}
$$ 

be two [[objects]] in a [[category]] with [[products]]. Then there exists [[generalized the|the]] [[product]] [[object]]

$$
  A \times B \in \mathcal{C}
  \,.
$$

We now declare that the [[syntax]] of which this state of affairs is the [[categorical semantics]] is the collection of symbols of the form

$$
  \frac{A \colon Type \;\;\;\;\; B \colon Type}{ A \times B \colon Type}
  \,.
$$

Here on top of the horizontal line we have the two [[judgments]] which express that, [[syntax|syntactically]], $A$ is a [[type]] and $B$ is a [[type]], and [[semantics|semantically]]  that $A \in \mathcal{C}$ and $B \in \mathcal{C}$. Below the horizontal line is, in turn, the [[judgment]] which expresses that there is, syntactically,  a [[product type]], which semantically is the [[product]] $A \times B \in \mathcal{C}$. The horizontal line itself is to indicate that if we are given the (symbols of) the collection of judgments on top, then we are entitled to also obtain the judgment on the bottom.

**Remark (Computation)** All this may seem, on first sight, like being a lot of fuss about something of grandiose banality. To see what is gradually being accomplished here despite of this appearance, as we proceed in this discussion, the reader can and should think of this as the first steps in the definition of a [[programming language]]: the notion of judgment is a syntactic rule for strings of symbols that a computer is to read in, and a [[natural deduction]]-step as the [[type formation rule]] above is an operation that this computer validates as being an allowed step of transforming a memory state with a given collection of such strings into a new memory state to which the string below the horizontal line is added. As we add the remaining rules below, what looks like a grandiose banality so far will remain grandiose, but no longer be a banality. The reader feeling in need of more motivational remarks along these lines might want to take a break here and have a look at the entry _[[computational trinitarianism]]_ first, that provides more pointers to the grandiose picture which we are approaching here.

Next, the second [[natural deduction]] rule for [[product types]] is the

**2. [[term elimination rule]]**. The fact that $A \times B \in \mathcal{C}$ is equipped with two [[projection]] [[morphisms]] 

$$
  \array{
    A \stackrel{p_1}{\leftarrow} A \times B \stackrel{p_2}{\to} B
  }
$$ 

means that from every [[element]] $t$ of $A \times B$ we may deduce the existence of [[elements]] $p_1(t)$ and $p_2(t)$ of $A$ and $B$, respectively. We declare now that this is the [[categorical semantics]] of which the [[natural deduction]] [[syntax]] is:

$$
  \frac{\vdash \; t \colon A \times B}{\vdash \; p_1(t) \colon A}
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \frac{\vdash \; t \colon A \times B}{\vdash \; p_2(t) \colon B}
  \,.
$$

As before, this is to say that if syntactically we are given strings of symbols expressing [[judgments]] as on the top of these horizontal lines, then we may "[[natural deduction|naturally deduce]]" also the judgment of the string of symbols on the bottom of this line.

**3. [[term introduction rule]]**. The first part of the [[universal property]] of the [[product]] in [[category theory]] is that for  $Q \in \mathcal{C}$ any other [[object]] equipped with morphisms 

$$
  \array{
    && Q
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{a}}\swarrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{b}}
    \\
    A  && &&  B
  }
$$ 

in $\mathcal{C}$, we obtain a canonical morphism 

$$
  Q \to A \times B
$$ 

in $\mathcal{C}$. This is now declared to be the [[categorical semantics]] of which the [[natural deduction]] [[syntax]] is

$$
  \frac{
    \vdash\; a \colon A \;\;\;\;\;\; \vdash\; b \colon B
  }{
   \vdash (a,b) \colon A \times B
  }
  \,.
$$

With the [[elements]] that are the [[semantics]] of the terms appearing here made explicit, this is the syntax for a [[diagram]]

$$
  \array{
     && Q
     \\
     & {}^{\mathllap{a}}\swarrow &\downarrow^{\mathrlap{(a,b)}}& \searrow^{\mathrlap{b}}
     \\
     A && A \times B && B
  }
  \,.
$$


**4. [[computation rule]]**. The next part of the [[universal property]] of the [[product]] in [[category theory]] is that the resulting [[diagram]]

$$
  \array{
    && Q
    \\ 
    & {}^{\mathllap{a}}\swarrow &\downarrow& \searrow^{\mathrlap{b}}
    \\
    A &\stackrel{p_1}{\leftarrow}& A \times B & \stackrel{p_2}{\to} & B
  }
$$

is in fact a _[[commuting diagram]]_. Syntactically this is, clearly, the rule that the following identifications of strings of symbols are to be enforced

$$
  p_1(a,b) = a \;\;\;\;\;\; p_2(a,b) = b
  \,. 
$$

This concluces the description of the [[natural deduction]] about [[objects]], [[morphisms]] and [[products]] in a [[category]] using its [[type theory]] [[syntax]]. We summarize the dictionary between [[category theory]] and [[type theory]] discussed so far [below](#DictionaryTypeTheoryCategoryTheory).


In the [next section](#SmoothSpaces) we promote our running example category $\mathcal{C}$, which admits only very few [[universal constructions]] (just [[products]]), to a richer category, the [[sheaf topos]] over it. That richer category then accordingly comes with a richer [[syntax]] of [[natural deduction]] inside it, namely with full [[dependent type theory]]. This we discuss in the [Syn Layer below](#SmoothSpacesLayerSyn).




#### Dictionary: type theory / category theory

Below in [Smooth spaces - Layer Syn](#SmoothSpacesLayerSyn) we complete this dictionary to one between [[dependent type theory]] with [[dependent products]] and [[toposes]].


## **Smooth spaces**
 {#SmoothSpaces}

In the section _[Coordinate systems](#CoordinateSystems)_ we have set up the archetypical [[spaces]] of [[differential geometry]]. Here we now define in terms of these the most general _[[smooth spaces]]_ that differential geometry can deal with. We also discuss basic properties of these smooth spaces. 

### Layer Mod
 {#SmoothSpacesLayerMod}

In this [Layer Mod](#LayerMod) we discuss concretely the definition of [[smooth spaces]] and of  [[homomorphisms]] between them,  together with basic examples and properties.

#### Plots of smooth spaces and their gluing
 {#PlotsOfSmoothSpacesAndTheirGluing}

The general kind of "[[smooth space]]" that we want to consider is a [[type|something]] that can be _probed_ by laying out coordinate systems as in def. \ref{CartesianSpacesAndSmoothFunctions} inside it, and that can be obtained by _gluing_ all the possible coordinate systems in it together. 

At this point we want to impose no further conditions on a "space" than this. In particular we do not assume that we know beforehand a [[set]] of [[points]] underlying $X$. Instead, we define smooth spaces $X$ entirely _operationally_ as something about which we can ask "Which ways are there to lay out $\mathbb{R}^n$ inside $X$?" and such that there is a self-consistent answer to this question. The following definitions make precise what we mean by this. The reader wishing to see more motivational discussion first might look at _[[motivation for sheaves, cohomology and higher stacks|conceptual exposition]]_.

For brevity we will refer "a way to lay out a coordinate system in $X$" as a _plot_ of $X$. The first set of consistency conditions on plots of a space is that they respect _coordinate transformations_. This is what the following definition formalizes.

+-- {: .num_defn #SmoothPreSpace}
###### Definition

A **smooth pre-space $X$ is 

1. a collection of sets: for each [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ (hence for each [[natural number]] $n$) a [[set]] 

   $$
     X(\mathbb{R}^n) \in Set
   $$  

   -- to be thought of as the _set of ways of laying out $\mathbb{R}^n$ inside $X$_;

1. for each abstract coordinate transformation, hence for each [[smooth function]] $f : \mathbb{R}^{n_1} \to \mathbb{R}^{n_2}$ a [[function]] between the corresponding sets

   $$
     X(f) : X(\mathbb{R}^{n_2}) \to X(\mathbb{R}^{n_1})
   $$

   -- to be thought of as the function that sends a _plot_ of $X$ by $\mathbb{R}^{n_2}$ to the correspondingly transformed plot by $\mathbb{R}^{n_1}$ induced by laying out $\mathbb{R}^{n_1}$ inside $\mathbb{R}^{n_2}$.

such that this is compatible with coordinate transformations:

1. the [[identity]] coordinate transformation does not change the plots:

   $$
     X(id_{\mathbb{R}^n}) = id_{X(\mathbb{R}^n)}
     \,,
   $$

1. changing plots along two consecutive coordinate transformations $f_1 \colon \mathbb{R}^{n_1} \to \mathbb{R}^{n_2}$ and $f_2 \colon \mathbb{R}^{n_2} \to \mathbb{R}^{n_3}$ is the same as changing them along the [[composition|composite]] coordinate transformation $f_2 \circ f_1$:

   $$
     X(f_2)\circ X(f_1) = X(f_2 \circ f_1)
     \,.
   $$
   
=--

But there is one more consistency condition for a collection of plots to really be probes of some space: it must be true that if we glue small coordinate systems to larger ones, then the plots by the larger ones are the same as the plots by the collection of smaller ones that agree where they overlap. We first formalize this idea of "plots that agree where their coordinate systems overlap."

+-- {: .num_defn #MatchingFamiliesOfPlots}

###### Remark

In def. \ref{MatchingFamiliesOfPlots} the [[equation]]

says in words:

> The plot $p_i$ of $X$ by the coordinate system $U_i$ inside the bigger coordinate system $\mathbb{R}^n$ coincides with the plot $p_j$ of $X$ by the other coordinate system $U_j$ inside $X$ when both are restricted to the [[intersection]] $U_i \cap U_j$ of $U_i$ with $U_j$ inside $\mathbb{R}^n$.

###### Remark

For each differentially good open cover $\{U_i \to X\}_{i \in I}$ and each smooth pre-space $X$, def. \ref{SmoothPreSpace}, there is a canonical [[function]]

$$
  X(\mathbb{R}^n) \to GluedPlots(\{U_i \to \mathbb{R}^n\}, X)
$$

from the set of $\mathbb{R}^n$-plots of $X$ to the set of tuples of glued plots, which sends a plot $p \in X(\mathbb{R}^n)$ to its restriction to all the $\phi_i \colon U_i \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$:

$$
  p \mapsto (X(\phi_i)(p))_{i \in I}

If $X$ is supposed to be consistently probable by coordinate systems, then it must be true that the set of ways of laying out a coordinate system $\mathbb{R}^n$ inside it coincides with the set of ways of laying out tuples of glued coordinate systems inside it, for each good cover $\{U_i \to \mathbb{R}^n\}$ as above. Therefore:

###### Definition

A smooth pre-space $X$, def. \ref{SmoothPreSpace} is a **[[smooth space]]** if for all differentially good open covers $\{U_i \to \mathbb{R}^n\}$, def. \ref{DifferentiallyGoodOpenCover}, the canonical function of remark \ref{NaiveDescentMorphism} from plots to glued plots is a [[bijection]]

$$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark #OnTheNotionOfSmoothSpaces}
###### Remark

We may think of a [[smooth space]] as being a kind of [[space]] whose _local models_ (in the general sense discussed at _[[geometry]]_) are [[Cartesian spaces]]: 

while definition \ref{SmoothSpace} explicitly says that a smooth space is something that is _consistently probeable_ by such local models; by a [[category theory|general abstract]] fact -- which we discuss in more detail below in _[Smooth Spaces - Layer Sem](#SmoothSpacesLayerSem)_  -- that is sometimes called the [[co-Yoneda lemma]] it follows in fact that smooth spaces are precisely the objects that are obtained by 
_gluing coordinate systems_ together.

For instance we will see that two open 2-balls $\mathbb{R}^2 \simeq D^2$ along a common rim yields the smooth space version of the [[sphere]] $S^2$, a basic example of a [[smooth manifold]]. But before we examine such explicit constructions, we discuss here for the moment more general properties of smooth spaces. The reader instead wishing to see more of these concrete examples at this point should jump ahead to _[Smooth Spaces - Outlook](#SmoothSpacesOutlook)_.

=--

But the following most basic example we consider right now:

+-- {: .num_example #CartesianSpaceAsSmoothSpace}
###### Example

For $n \in \mathbb{R}^n$, there is a [[smooth space]], def. \ref{SmoothSpace}, whose set of plots over the abstract coordinate systems $\mathbb{R}^k$ is the set

$$
  CartSp(\mathbb{R}^k, \mathbb{R}^n) \in Set
$$ 

of [[smooth functions]] from $\mathbb{R}^k$ to $\mathbb{R}^n$.

Clearly this is the rule for plots that characterize $\mathbb{R}^n$ itself as a smooth space, and so we will just denote this smooth space by the same symbols "$\mathbb{R}^n$":

$$
  \mathbb{R}^n \colon \mathbb{R}^k \mapsto CartSp(\mathbb{R}^k, \mathbb{R}^n)
  \,.
$$

In particular the [[real line]] $\mathbb{R}$ is this way itself a [[smooth space]].

=--


In a moment we find a formal justification for this slight abuse of notation.

More examples of smooth spaces can be built notably by [[intersection|intersecting]] [[images]] of two smooth spaces inside a bigger one. In order to say this we first need a formalization of [[homomorphism]] of smooth spaces. This we turn to now.


#### Homomorphisms of smooth spaces
 {#HomomorphismsOfSmoothSpaces}

We discuss "functions" or "maps" between [[smooth spaces]], def. \ref{SmoothSpace}, which preserve the smooth space [[structure]] in a suitable sense. As with any notion of function that preserves structure, we refer to them as _[[homomorphisms]]_.

The idea of the following definition is to say that whatever a [[homomorphism]] $f : X \to Y$ between two smooth spaces is, it has to take the plots of $X$ by $\mathbb{R}^n$ to a corresponding plot of $Y$, such that this respects coordinate transformations.

+-- {: .num_defn #HomomorphismOfSmoothSpaces}
###### Definition

Let $X$ and $Y$ be two smooth spaces, def. \ref{SmoothSpace}. Then a [[homomorphism]] $f \colon X \to Y$ is

* for each abstract coordinate system $\mathbb{R}^n$ (hence for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$) a [[function]]

  $f_{\mathbb{R}^n} : X(\mathbb{R}^n) \to Y(\mathbb{R}^n)$

  that sends $\mathbb{R}^n$-plots of $X$ to $\mathbb{R}^n$-plots of $Y$ 

such that 

* for each [[smooth function]] $\phi : \mathbb{R}^{n_1} \to \mathbb{R}^{n_2}$ we have

  $$
    Y(\phi) \circ f_{\mathbb{R}^{n_1}} = f_{\mathbb{R}^{n_2}} \circ X(\phi)
  $$   

  hence a [[commuting diagram]]

  $$
    \array{
      X(\mathbb{R}^{n_1}) &\stackrel{f_{\mathbb{R}^{n_1}}}{\to}& Y(\mathbb{R}^{n_1})
      \\
      \downarrow^{\mathrlap{X(\phi)}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{Y(\phi)}}
      \\
      X(\mathbb{R}^{n_2}) &\stackrel{f_{\mathbb{R}^{n_2}}}{\to}& Y(\mathbb{R}^{n_1})
    }
    \,.
  $$

For $f_1 : X \to Y$ and $f_2 : X \to Y$ to homomorphism of smooth spaces, their [[composition]] $f_2 \circ f_1 \colon X \to Y$ is defined to be the homomorphism whose component over $\mathbb{R}^n$ is the composite of functions of the components of $f_1$ and $f_2$:

$$

Write $Smooth0Type$ for the [[category]] whose [[objects]] are [[smooth spaces]], def. \ref{SmoothSpace}, and whose [[morphisms]] are homomorphisms of smooth spaces, def. \ref{HomomorphismOfSmoothSpaces}.

=--

At this point it may seem that we have now _two different_ notions for how to lay out a coordinate system in a smooth space $X$: on the hand, $X$ comes by definition with a rule for what the set $X(\mathbb{R}^n)$ of its $\mathbb{R}^n$-plots is. On the other hand, we can now regard the abstract coordinate system $\mathbb{R}^n$ itself as a smooth space, by example \ref{CartesianSpaceAsSmoothSpace}, and then say that an  $\mathbb{R}^n$-plot of $X$ should be a homomorphism of smooth spaces of the form $\mathbb{R}^n \to X$.

The following proposition says that these two superficially different notions actually naturally coincide.

###### Proposition

Let $X$ be any [[smooth space]], def. \ref{SmoothSpace}, and regard the abstract coordinate system $\mathbb{R}^n$ as a smooth space, by example \ref{CartesianSpaceAsSmoothSpace}. There is a [[natural bijection]]

$$
  X(\mathbb{R}^n) \simeq Hom_{Smooth0Type}(\mathbb{R}^n, X)
$$

between the _postulated_ $\mathbb{R}^n$-plots of $X$ and the _actual_ $\mathbb{R}^n$-plots given by homomorphism of smooth spaces $\mathbb{R}^n \to X$.

###### Proof

This is a special case of the _[[Yoneda lemma]]_, as will be made more explicit below in _[The topos of smooth spaces](#ToposOfSmoothSpaces)_. 
The reader unfamiliar with this should write out the simple proof explicitly: use the defining [[commuting diagrams]] in def. \ref{HomomorphismOfSmoothSpaces} to deduce that a homomorphism $f : \mathbb{R}^n \to X$ is uniquely fixed by the image of the [[identity]] element in  $\mathbb{R}^n(\mathbb{R}^n) \coloneqq CartSp(\mathbb{R}^n, \mathbb{R}^n)$ under the component function $f_{\mathbb{R}^n} : \mathbb{R}^n(\mathbb{R}^n) \to X(\mathbb{R}^n)$.

$$
  f \colon X \to \mathbb{R}
$$

is a _[[smooth function]] on $X$_. Prop. \ref{YonedaForSmoothSpaces} says here that when $X$ happens to be an abstract coordinate system regarded as a smooth space by def. \ref{CartesianSpaceAsSmoothSpace}, then this general notion of smooth functions between smooth spaces reproduces the basic notion of def, \ref{CartesianSpaceAndHomomorphism}.

By prop. \ref{YonedaForSmoothSpaces} the points of a smooth space $X$ are naturally identified with its 0-dimensional plots, hence with the "ways of laying out a 0-dimensional coordinate system" in $X$:

#### Products and fiber products of smooth spaces
 {#ProductsAndFiberProductsOfSmoothSpaces}

+-- {: .num_defn #ProductOfSmoothSpaces}
###### Definition

Let $X, Y \in Smooth0Type$ by two smooth spaces. Their **[[product]]** is the smooth space $X \times Y \in Smooth0Type$ whose plots are pairs of plots of $X$ and $Y$:

$$
  X\times Y (\mathbb{R}^n) \coloneqq X(\mathbb{R}^n) \times Y(\mathbb{R}^n)

$$

The **projection on the first factor** is the homomorphism

$$
   p_1 \colon X \times Y \to X
$$

which sends $\mathbb{R}^n$-plots of $X \times Y$ to those of $X$ by forming the projection of the [[cartesian product]] of sets:

$$
  {p_1}_{\mathbb{R}^n} \colon X(\mathbb{R}^n) \times Y(\mathbb{R}^n) \stackrel{p_1}{\to} X(\mathbb{R}^n)

Let $f \colon X \to Z$ and $g \colon Y \to Z$ be two [[homomorphisms]] of smooth spaces, def. \ref{HomomorphismOfSmoothSpaces}. There is then a new smooth space to be denoted 

$$
  X \times_Z Y \in Smooth0Type
$$ 

(with $f$ and $g$ understood), called the [[fiber product]] of $X$ and $Y$ along $f$ and $g$, and defined as follows:

the set of $\mathbb{R}^n$-plots of $X \times_Z Y$ is the set of pairs of plots of $X$ and $Y$ which become the same plot of $Z$ under $f$ and $g$, respectively:

$$
  (X \times_Z Y)(\mathbb{R}^n)
  =
  \left\{
    (p_X \in X(\mathbb{R}^n), p_Y \in Y(\mathbb{R}^n))

#### Smooth mapping spaces and smooth moduli spaces
 {#SmoothMappingSpaces}


+-- {: .num_defn #SmoothFunctionSpace}
###### Definition

Let $\Sigma, X \in Smooth0Type$ be two [[smooth spaces]], def. \ref{#SmoothSpace}. Then the **smooth [[mapping space]]** 

$$
  [\Sigma,X] \in Smooth0Type
$$ 

is the [[smooth space]] defined by saying that its set of $\mathbb{R}^n$-plots is

$$
  [\Sigma, X](\mathbb{R}^n)
   \coloneqq
  Hom(\Sigma \times \mathbb{R}^n, X)
  \,.
$$

=--

Here in $\Sigma \times \mathbb{R}^n$ we first regard the abstract coordinate system $\mathbb{R}^n$ as a smooth space by example \ref{CartesianSpaceAsSmoothSpace} and then we form the [[product]] smooth space by def. \ref{ProductOfSmoothSpaces}.

+-- {: .num_remark #NatureOfPlotsOfMappingSpace}
###### Remark

This means in words that a $\mathbb{R}^n$-plot of the [[mapping space]] $[\Sigma,X]$ is a smooth $\mathbb{R}^n$-parameterized _family_ of homomorphisms $\Sigma \to X$.

There is a [[natural bijection]]

$$
  Hom(K, [\Sigma, X])
  \simeq
  Hom(K \times \Sigma, X)  
$$

for every smooth space $K$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

With a bit of work this is straightforward to check explicitly by unwinding the definitions. It follows however from [[category theory|general abstract]] results once we realize that $[-,-]$ is of course the _[[internal hom]]_ of smooth spaces. This we come to below in _[Smooth spaces - Layer Sem](#SmoothSpacesLayerSem)_.

=--


+-- {: .num_remark #MappingSpaceAsModuliSpace}
###### Remark

This says in words that a smooth function from any $K$ into the mapping space $[\Sigma,X]$ is equivalently a smooth function from $K \times \Sigma$ to $X$. The latter we may regard as a _$K$-parameterized smooth family_ of smooth functions $\Sigma \to X$. Therefore in view of the previous remark \ref{NatureOfPlotsOfMappingSpace} this says that smooth mapping spaces have a [[universal property]] not just over abstract coordinate systems, but over all smooth spaces.

We will therefore also say that $[\Sigma,X]$ is the **smooth [[moduli space]]** of smooth functions from $\Sigma \to X$, because it is such that smooth maps $K \to [\Sigma,X]$ into it _modulate_, as we move around on $K$, a family of smooth functions $\Sigma\to X$, depending on $K$.

=--

First interesting examples of such smooth moduli spaces are discussed in _[Differential forms -- Layer Mod](#DifferentialFormsLayerMod)_ below. Many more interesting examples follow once we pass from smooth 0-types to smooth $n$-types below in _[Smooth n-groupoids](#SmoothnGroupoids)_. 

We will see many more examples of smooth moduli spaces, starting below in _[Differential forms - Layer Mod](#DifferentialFormsLayerMod)_.

+-- {: .num_prop #UnderlyingSetOfSmoothMappingSpace}
###### Proposition

The set of points, def. \ref{PointsOfASmoothSpace}, of a smooth mapping space $[\Sigma,X]$ is the bare set of homomorphism $\Sigma \to X$: there is a [[natural isomorphism]]

$$
  Hom(*, [\Sigma, X]) \simeq Hom(\Sigma, X)

Given a [[smooth space]] $X \in Smooth0Type$, its smooth **[[path space]]** is the smooth mapping space

$$
  \mathbf{P}X \coloneqq [\mathbb{R}^1, X]
  \,.
$$ 

By prop. \ref{UnderlyingSetOfSmoothMappingSpace} the points of $P X$ are indeed precisely the smooth trajectories $\mathbb{R}^1 \to X$. But $P X$ also knows how to _smoothly vary_ such smooth trajectories. 

This is central for [[variational calculus]] which determines [[equations of motion]] in [[physics]]. This we turn to below in _[Variational calculus](#VariationalCalculus)_.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

In [[physics]], if $X$ is a model for [[spacetime]], then $P X$ may notably be interpreted as the smooth space of [[worldlines]] _in_ $X$, hence the smooth space of paths or _trajectories_ of a [[particle]] in $X$.

#### The smooth moduli space of smooth functions
 {#SmoothModuliSpaceOfSmoothFunctions}


In example \ref{SmoothFunctionOnSmoothSpace} we saw that a smooth function on a general [[smooth space]] $X$ is a homomorphism of smooth spaces, def. \ref{HomomorphismOfSmoothSpaces}

$$
  f \colon X \to \mathbb{R}
  \,.
$$

The collection of these forms the [[hom-set]] $Hom_{Smooth0Type}(X, \mathbb{R})$. But by the discussion in _[Smooth mapping spaces](#SmoothMappingSpaces)_ such hom-sets are naturally refined to smooth spaces themselves.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For $X \in Smooth0Type$ a [[smooth space]], we say that the **moduli space of smooth functions** on $X$ is the smooth mapping space (def. \ref{SmoothFunctionSpace})

$$
  [X, \mathbb{R}] \in Smooth0Type

$$

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

We call this a _[[moduli space]]_ because by prop. \ref{UniversalPropertyOfMappingSpace} above and in the sense of remark \ref{MappingSpaceAsModuliSpace} it is such that smooth functions into it _modulate_ smooth functions $X \to \mathbb{R}$.

By prop. \ref{UnderlyingSetOfSmoothMappingSpace} a point $* \to [X,\mathbb{R}^1]$ of the moduli space is equivalently a smooth function $X \to \mathbb{R}^1$.

Later we define/see the following:

* A _[[diffeological space]]_ is a [[smooth space]] such that every coordinate labels a [[point]] in the space. In other words, a diffeological space is a smooth space that has an underlying set $X_s \in Set$ of points such that the set of $\mathbb{R}^n$-plots is a subset of the set of all functions:

  $$
    X(\mathbb{R}^n) \hookrightarrow Functions(\mathbb{R}^n, S_s)

  (This need not be the case in a general smooth space, important counterexamples are the _universal smooth moduli spaces of differential forms_ in [Smooth moduli space of differential forms](#SmoothUniversalModuliSpaceOfDifferentialForms)).

In this [Layer Sem]{#LayerSem} we mention some basic definitions of [[topos theory]] and discuss the [[topos]] formed by the [[smooth spaces]] defined in [Smooth Spaces - Mayer Mod](#SmoothSpacesLayerMod).


#### The topos of smooth spaces
 {#ToposOfSmoothSpaces}

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

* A _smooth pre-space_, def. \ref{SmoothPreSpace} is equivalently a [[presheaf]] on [[CartSp]], hence a [[functor]] $X : CartSp^{op} \to Set$;

* a _[[smooth space]]_, def. \ref{SmoothSpace}, is equivalently a presheaf on [[CartSp]] which is a [[sheaf]] with respect to the differentially [[good open cover]]-[[coverage]]:

  * the set of "glued plots", def. \ref{MatchingFamiliesOfPlots} is the [[descent object]];

  * the canonical morphism of remark \ref{NaiveDescentMorphism} is the [[descent morphism]];

  * the condition that it be an isomorphism (for each differentially good open cover) is the [[descent]]- or [[sheaf]] condition.

+-- {: .num_defn #SheafToposAsSubtopos}
###### Definition

A [[sheaf topos]] is [[subtopos]] of [[presheaf topos]]

$$

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Here the [[left adjoint]] $\overline{(-)}$, which is equivalently

* the [[inverse image]] of the [[geometric embedding]] [[geometric morphism]]

* the [[sheafification]] functor

is precisely such that for every [[covering]] $\{U_i \to U\}_{i \in I}$ in the [[site]] $C$ the [[sieve]] inclusion 

$$
  S(\{U_i\}) \hookrightarrow U \;\;\;\; \in PSh(C)
$$

(a [[dense monomorphism]]) is sent to an [[isomorphism]].

Hence the sheaf topos is the left exact [[localization]] at the covering sieve inclusions.

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

The [[presheaf topos]] $PSh(C)$ is the [[free cocompletion]] of the [[category]] $C$, hence the category obtained from $C$ by [[free construction|freely]] forming [[colimits]] of its objects.

In contrast, the [[localization]] $Sh(C) \hookrightarrow PSh(C)$ enforces _relations_ between these free colimits.

Therefore in total we may think of $Sh(C)$ as obtained by [[generators and relations]] from the [[site]] $C$: 

* the objects of $C$ are the generators;

* the [[coverings]] of $C$ are the relations.

Def. \ref{SheafToposAsSubtopos} is the "external" characterization of sheaf toposes. More intrinsically we have _[[Giraud's theorem]]_:

A [[sheaf topos]] is equivalently a [[presentable category]] with

1. [[effective quotients]]

This characterization, or rather its refinement to [[(infinity,1)-categories of (infinity,1)-sheaves]], is crucial, below, for the discussion of [[principal bundles]] and their [[associated bundle|associated]] [[fiber bundles]]. 

For other general considerations we need rather that every [[sheaf topos]] is in particular an _[[elementary topos]]_

The first of these says that the [[internal language]] is [[dependent type theory]] with [[dependent sum types]] and [[dependent product types]], the second says that its has a [[type of propositions]]. This we turn to in [Smooth Spaces - Layer Syn](#SmoothSpacesLayerSyn) below.

The sheaf topos of [[smooth spaces]] has a few more crucial properties: it is

* a [[locally connected topos|locally connected]] and [[connected topos]]

* a [[local topos]]

* a [[cohesive topos]]. This we discuss in the remainder of this [Layer Sem](#LayerSem).


#### Connectedness of the topos of smooth spaces
 {#ConnectedSmooth0Type}

The full [[sheaf topos]] $Sh(CartSp)$ on [[CartSp]] is a [[locally connected topos]] in that the terminal [[global section]] [[geometric morphism]] to [[Set]] is an [[essential geometric morphism]]:

$$
  Sh(CartSp)
  \stackrel{\overset{\Pi_0}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{L Const}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma}{\to}}}
  Set
$$

The extra [[left adjoint]] $\Pi_0 : Sh(CartSp) \to Set$ sends diffeological spaces to the set of path-[[connected]] components of their underlying [[topological space]]s.


+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The [[sheaf topos]] $Sh(CartSp)$ on [[CartSp]] is a [[locally connected topos]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The following argument works for every [[site]] $C$ which is such that constant presheaves on $C$ are already sheaves.

Notice that this is the case for $C = CartSp$ because every Cartesian space is connected: for $S \in Set$ a compatible family of elements of $Const S$ on a cover $\{U_i \to \mathbb{R}^n\}$ of some $\mathbb{R}^n$ is an element of $S$ on each patch, such that their restriction maps to intersections of patches coincide. But the restriction maps are all identities, so this says that all these elements coincide. Therefore the set of compatible families is just the set $S$ itself, hence the presheaf $Const S$ is a sheaf.

So with $L : PSh(C) \to Sh(C)$ the [[sheafification]] functor we have that $L Const S \simeq Const S$.

Whenever this is the case the [[left adjoint]] to the constant presheaf functor, which always exists for presheaves and is given by the [[colimit]] functor, is also left adjoint on the level of sheaves, because for each $X \in Sh(C)$ and $S \in Set$ we have natural bijections

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    Hom_{Sh(C)}(X, L Const S)
    & =
    Hom_{PSh(C)}(X, L Const S)
    \\
    & \simeq
    Hom_{PSh(C)}(X, Const S)
    \\
    & \simeq
    Hom_{Set}(\lim_\to X, S)
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

###### Definition

Write $\Pi_0 := \lim_\to : Sh(CartSp) \to Set$
for the [[left adjoint]] to $LConst : Set \stackrel{Const}{\to} PSh(C) \stackrel{L}{\to} Sh(C)$.

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

For $X \in Sh(C)$ a diffeological space, $\Pi_0(X)$ is the set of path-connected components of the topological space underlying $X$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the [[co-Yoneda lemma]] we may write 

$$
  X = {\lim_\to}_{(U \to X) \in y/X} U
$$

and since $\Pi_0$ commutes with colimits we have

$$
  \Pi_0(X) \simeq 
  \Pi_0 {\lim_\to}_{(U \to X)} U
  \simeq
  {\lim_\to}_{(U \to X)} \Pi_0(U)
  \,.
$$

But also by the co-Yoneda lemma we have that the [[colimit]] over any [[representable functor|representable]] is the singleton set, hence our expression

$$
  \cdots \simeq 
  {\lim_\to}_{(U \to X)} *
$$

is the colimit over the category of plots of $X$ of the functor that is constant on the point. This colimit is the [[coproduct]] of points over the connected components of the [[diagram]] category.

The connected components of the category of plots $y/X$ are the path-connected (or "plot-connected") components of the underlying topological space of $X$.

###### Proposition

The [[sheaf topos]] $Sh(CartSp)$ on [[CartSp]] is actually a [[connected topos]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Since $CartSp$ is a [[connected category]] it is immediate that $Const \colon Set \to PSh(CartSp)$ is a [[full and faithful functor]]. By the above this equals $L Const$, which is hence also full and faithful.

By the discussion at [[connected topos]] we could equivalently convince ourselves that $\Pi_0$ preserves the terminal object. The terminal object of $Sh(CartSp)$ is $y(\mathbb{R}^0)$, hence representable. By the above, $\Pi_0$ sends all representable objects to the singleton set, which is the terminal object of $Set$.

The [[sheaf topos]] $Sh(CartSp)$ is also a [[local topos]]

$$

$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


The [[site]] [[CartSp]] is a [[local site]]: it has a [[terminal object]] and the only [[covering]] [[sieve]] of this object is the trivial one. This implies the claim, by the discussion at [[local site]].

Concretely, the extra [[right adjoint]] $CoDisc$ takes a [[set]] $S$ to the presheaf given by the assigmnent

$$
  CoDisc(S) : U \mapsto Hom_{Set}(CartSp(*,U), S)
  \,,
$$

that takes a Cartesian space $U$ to the set of [[function]]s from its underlying set of points to $S$. This is clearly a sheaf (a function of sets from $U$ to $S$ is clearly fixed by all its restrictions to a collections of  subsets of $U$ whose unition is $U$.)

=--

Geometrically, the object $CoDisc S \in Sh(CartSp)$ is the diffeological space [[codiscrete space|codiscrete]] (indiscrte) smooth structure.

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Every [[local topos]] comes with its notion of [[concrete sheaves]] that form a sub-[[quasitopos]]. For the local topos $Sh(CartSp)$ these are precisely the diffeological spaces.

$$
  Set \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\underset{CoDisc}{\hookrightarrow}}
  DiffologicalSp \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\hookrightarrow}
  Sh(CartSp)
$$


=--



+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


The [[concrete sheaves]] for the [[local topos]] $Sh(CartSp)$ are by definition those objects $X$ for which the 
$(\Gamma \dashv CoDisc)$-[[unit of an adjunction|unit]]

$$
  X \to CoDisc \Gamma X
$$

is a [[monomorphism]]. Monomorphisms of sheaves are tested objectwise, so that means equivalently that for every $U \in CartSp$ we have that 

$$
  X(U) \simeq Hom_{Sh}(U,X) \to Hom_{Sh}(U, Codisc \Gamma X)
  \simeq Hom_{Set}(\Gamma U, \Gamma X)
$$

is a monomorphism. This is precisely the condition on a sheaf to be a diffeological space.

The [[sheaf topos]] $Sh(CartSp)$ is even a [[cohesive topos]] in which the axiom _[pieces have points](/nlab/show/cohesive+topos#PiecesHavePoints)_ holds.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The [[site]] [[CartSp]] is a [[cohesive site]] (see there for detail). This implies the statement.

=--

This implies that $Sh(CartSp)$ is a [[locally connected topos]], [[connected topos]], [[local topos]]. It means in addition that it is also a [[strongly connected topos]].

This means that there is a _homotopy category_ or _concordance category_ of [[smooth spaces]], with the same objects as $Sh(CartSp)$, but with hom-sets given by

$$
  Conc(X,Y) := \Pi_0 [X,Y]_{Sh(CartSp)}

where $[X,Y]_{Sh(CartSp)}$ is the [[internal hom]] in the [[cartesian closed category]] $Sh(CartSp)$.

$X \to \sharp A$ is equivalently a function
$\Gamma X \to \Gamma A$ of the underlying sets. This means that smooth maps $X \to \sharp A$ are like maps into $A$ that do _not_ have to respect the cohesive structure on $A$, but instead 
can be arbitrarily "kinky" ("sharp").

## **Differential forms**
 {#DifferentialForms}


We introduce the standard concept of _[[nLab:differential forms]]_ in _[Layer Mod](#DifferentialFormsLayerMod)_, adding to the traditional discussion a precise version of the statement that differential forms are equivalently "incremental smooth $n$-dimensional measures", which accurately captures the role that they play in [[physics]], notably in [[local action functionals]].

We define differential forms on general smooth spaces seamlessly in terms of the smooth [[moduli space]] $\Omega^\in \in Smooth0Type$ of differential forms. This has the special property that it is, for $n \geq 1$, a _non-[[concrete object|concrete]]_ smooth space. In _[Layer Sem](#DifferentialFormsLayerSem)_ below we take this as occasion to discuss the notion of [[concrete objects]] in a [[local topos]], such as the topos of smooth spaces. We show how the _concretification_ of the smooth mapping space $[X,\Omega^n]$ for any smooth space $X$ is the _smooth (moduli) space of differential forms on $X$_. Below in _[Action functionals for Chern-Simons type gauge theories](#ActionFunctionalsForChernSimonsTypeGaugeTheories)_ the theory of _concretification_ in a local topos is a central ingredient in the _canonical existence_ of certain [[nLab:action functionals]].

The process of concretification involves the general abstract notion of _[[image|images]]_. The type-theory of this notion we discuss in [Layer Syn](#DifferentialFormsLayerSyn) here.


### Layer Mod
 {#DifferentialFormsLayerMod}

We have seen above in _[The continuum real (world-)line](TheContinuumRealWorldLine)_ that that [[real line]] $\mathbb{R}$ is the basic [[kinematics|kinematical structure]] in the [[differential geometry]] of [[physics]]. Notably the smooth [[path spaces]] $[\mathbb{R}, X]$ from example \ref{SmoothPathSpace} are to be thought of as the smooth spaces of _trajectories_ (for instance of some [[particle]]) in a [[smooth space]] $X$, hence of smooth maps $\mathbb{R} \to X$.

But moreover, _[[dynamics]]_ in [[physics]]  is encoded by _[[functionals]] on such trajectories_: by "[[action functionals]]". In the simplest case these are for instance homomorphisms of smooth spaces

$$
  S \colon \left[I, X\right] \to \mathbb{R}
  \,,
$$

where $I \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is the standard unit [[interval]].

Such [[action functionals]] we discuss in their own right in _[Variational calculus](#VariationalCalculus)_ below. Here we first examine in detail a fundamental property they all have: they are supposed to be _[[local action functional|local]]_.

Foremost this means that the value associated to a trajectory is _built up incrementally_ from small contributions associated to small sub-trajectories: if a rajectory $\gamma$ is decomposed as a trajectory $\gamma_1$ followed by a trajectory $\gamma_2$, then the action functional is assitive

$$
  S(\gamma) = S(\gamma_1) + S(\gamma_2)
  \,.
$$

As one takes this property to the limit of iterative subdivision, one finds that action functionals are entirely determined by their value on _[[infinitesimal space|infinitesimal]] displacements_ along the worldline. If $\gamma \colon \mathbb{R} \to X$ denotes a path and "$\dot \gamma(x)$" denotes the corresponding "infinitesimal path" at worldline parameter $x$, then the value of the action functional on such an infinitesimal path is traditionally written as

$$
  \mathbf{d}S(\dot \gamma)_x  \in \mathbb{R}
  \,,
$$

to be read as "the small change $\mathbf{d}S$ of $S$ along the infinitesimal path $\dot \gamma_x$". 

This function $\mathbf{d}S$ that assigns numbers to infinitesimal paths is called a _[[differential form]]_. Etymologically this originates in the use of "form" as in _[[bilinear form]]_: something that is evaluated. Here it is evaluated on _infinitesimal differences_, referred to as _differentials_.



We define smooth differential forms on [[Cartesian spaces]] in 

* _[Differential forms on abstract coordinate sysetms](#DifferentialFormsOnAbstractCoordinateSystem)_

Then we discuss how this induces a notion of smooth differential forms on general [[smooth spaces]] in 

* _[Smooth universal moduli space of differential forms](#SmoothUniversalModuliSpaceOfDifferentialForms)_.

Further below we provide a precise version of the statement that "Differential 1-forms are differential measures along paths." in 

* _[Differential 1-forms are smooth incremental path measures](#1FormsAsSmoothFunctors)_.


#### Differential forms on abstract coordinate systems
 {#DifferentialFormsOnAbstractCoordinateSystem}

We introduce the basic concept of a smooth [[differential form]] on a [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$. Below in _[Differential forms on smooth spaces](#SmoothUniversalModuliSpaceOfDifferentialForms)_ we use this to define differential forms on any [[smooth space]].

+-- {: .num_defn #Differential1FormsOnCartesianSpaces}
###### Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ a **[[smooth differential 1-form]]** $\omega$ on a [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ is an $n$-[[tuple]] 

$$
  \left(\omega_i \in CartSp\left(\mathbb{R}^n,\mathbb{R}\right)\right)_{i = 1}^n
$$

of [[smooth functions]], which we think of equivalently as the [[coefficients]] of a [[formal linear combination]]

$$
  \omega = \sum_{i = 1}^n f_i \mathbf{d}x^i
$$

on a [[set]] $\{\mathbf{d}x^1, \mathbf{d}x^2, \cdots, \mathbf{d}x^n\}$ of [[cardinality]] $n$.

Write 

$$
  \Omega^1(\mathbb{R}^k) \simeq CartSp(\mathbb{R}^k, \mathbb{R})^{\times k}\in Set
$$

for the set of smooth [[differential 1-forms]] on $\mathbb{R}^k$.

For $\phi \colon \mathbb{R}^{\tilde n} \to \mathbb{R}^n$ a [[smooth function]], the **[[pullback of differential forms|pullback of differential 1-forms]]** along $f$ is the [[function]]

$$
  f^* \colon \Omega^1(\mathbb{R}^{k}) \to \Omega^1(\mathbb{R}^{\tilde k})
$$

defined on [[basis]]-elements by

$$
  f^* \mathbf{d} x^i \coloneqq \sum_{j = 1}^{\tilde k} \frac{\partial f^i}{\partial \tilde x^j} \mathbf{d}\tilde x^j
$$

and then extended linearly, hence

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    f^* \omega & = f^* \left( \sum_{i} \omega_i \mathbf{d}x^i \right)
    \\
    & \coloneqq

###### Remark

We think of $\mathbf{d} x^i$ as a measure for [[infinitesimal space|infinitesimal]] displacements along the $x^i$-[[coordinate]] of a [[Cartesian space]]. This idea is made precise below in [Differential 1-forms are smooth increnemental path measures](#1FormsAsSmoothFunctors).

The following definition captures the idea that if $\mathbf{d} x^i$ is a measure for displacement along the $x^i$-[[coordinate]], and $\mathbf{d}x^j$ a measure for displacement along the $x^j$ coordinate, then there should be a way te get a measure, to be called $\mathbf{d}x^i \wedge \mathbf{d} x^j$, for infinitesimal _surfaces_ (squares) in the $x^i$-$x^j$-plane. And this should keep track of the [[orientation]] of these squares, whith 

$$
  \mathbf{d}x^j \wedge \mathbf{d}x^i = - \mathbf{d}x^i \wedge \mathbf{d} x^j

#### Differential forms on smooth spaces

Above we have defined differential $n$-form on abstract coordinate systems. Here we extend this definition to one of differential $n$-forms on arbitrary [[smooth spaces]]. We start by observing that the space of _all_ differential $n$-forms on cordinate systems themselves naturally is a smooth space.

    \\
    \mathbb{R}^{k_2} &\mapsto& \Omega^1(\mathbb{R}^{k_2})

The reason for this terminology is that homomorphisms of smooth spaces into $\Omega^1$ _modulate_ differential $n$-forms on their [[domain]], by prop. \ref{YonedaForSmoothSpaces} (and hence by the [[Yoneda lemma]]):

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

For the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^k$ regarded as a smooth space by example \ref{CartesianSpaceAsSmoothSpace}, there is a [[natural bijection]]

$$
  \Omega^n(\mathbb{R}^k) \simeq Hom(\mathbb{R}^k, \Omega^1)
$$

between the set of smooth $n$-forms on $\mathbb{R}^n$ according to def. \ref{Differential1FormsOnCartesianSpaces} and the set of homomorphism of smooth spaces, $\mathbb{R}^k \to \Omega^1$, according to def. \ref{HomomorphismOfSmoothSpaces}.

=--

In view of this we have the following elegant definition of smooth $n$-forms on an arbitrary smooth space.

+-- {: .num_defn #DifferentialnFormOnSmoothSpace}
###### Definition

For $X \in Smooth0Type$ a [[smooth space]], def. \ref{SmoothSpace}, a **[[differential n-form]]** on $X$ is a [[homomorphism]] of [[smooth spaces]] of the form

$$
  \omega \colon X \to \Omega^n(-)
  \,.
$$

Accordingly we write

$$
  \Omega^n(X) \coloneqq Smooth0Type(X,\Omega^n)
$$

for the set of smooth $n$-forms on $X$.

=--

We may unwind this definition to a very explicit description of differential forms on smooth spaces. This we do in a moment in remark \ref{DifferentialFormOnSmoothSpaceAsSystemOfDiffFormsOnCoordinates}.

given by the [[hom-functor]] into the smooth space $\Omega^n$ of def. \ref{SmoothModuliSpaceOfnForms}:

$$
 f^* \coloneqq Hom(-, \Omega^n)

This means that it sends an $n$-form $\omega \in \Omega^n(Y)$ which is modulated by a homomorphism $Y \to \Omega^n$ to the $n$-form $f^* \omega \in \Omega^n(X)$ which is modulated by the [[composition|composite]] $X \stackrel{f}{\to} X \to \Omega^n$.

Using def. \ref{PullbackOfDifferentialFormsOnSmoothSpaces}

Unwinding def. \ref{DifferentialnFormOnSmoothSpace} yields the following explicit description:

a differential $n$-form $\omega \in \Omega^n(X)$ on a smooth space $X$ is

1. for each way $\phi \colon \mathbb{R}^k \to X$ of laying out a coordinate system $\mathbb{R}^k$ in $X$ a differential $n$-form

   $$
     \phi^* \omega \in \Omega^n(\mathbb{R}^k)
   $$

   on the abstract coordinate system, as given by def. \ref{DifferentialnForms};

1. for each abstract [[coordinate transformation]] $f \colon \mathbb{R}^{k_2} \to \mathbb{R}^{k_1}$ a corresponding compatibility condition between local differential forms $\phi_1 \colon \mathbb{R}^{k_1} \to X$ and $\phi_2 \colon \mathbb{R}^{k_2} \to X$ of the form

   $$
     f^* \phi_1^* \omega = \phi_2^* \omega
     \,.
   $$

Hence a differential form on a smooth space is simply a collection of differential forms on all its coordinate systems such that these glue along all possible coordinate transformations.

The following adds further explanation to the role of $\Omega^n \in Smooth0Tye$ as a _[[moduli space]]_. Notice that since $\Omega^n$ is itself a [[smooth space]], we may speak about differential $n$-forms on $\Omega^n$ itsefl.

#### Concrete smooth spaces
 {#ConcreteObjects}

The smooth universal moduli space of differential forms $\Omega^n(-)$
from def. \ref{SmoothModuliSpaceOfnForms}
is noteworthy in that it has a property not shared by 
many smooth spaces that one might think of more naively: while evidently being "large" (the space of all differential forms!) it has "very few points" and "very few $k$-dimensional subspaces" for low $k$.  In fact 

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

For $k \lt n$ the smooth space $\Omega^n$ admits only a unique probe by $\mathbb{R}^k$:

$$

  \simeq
  \Omega^n(\mathbb{R}^k)
  = 
  \{0\}
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the [[Yoneda lemma]] a smooth morphism $\mathbb{R}^k \to \Omega^n$ is a [[differential n-form]] $\omega \in \Omega^n(\mathbb{R}^k)$. But for $n \gt k$ there is only the 0 element.

=--

So while $\Omega^n()$ is a large smooth space, it is "not supported on probes" in low dimensions in as much as one might expect, from more naive notions of smooth spaces.

We now formalize this. The formal notion of an smooth space which _is_ supported on its probes is that of a _[[concrete object]]_. There is a univeral map that sends any smooth space to its _concretification_. The universal moduli spaces of differential forms turn out to be _non-concrete_ in that their concetrification is the point.

This is not _quite_ what one usually wants to regard as an $\mathbb{R}^k$-parameterized of differential forms on $X$. That is instead usually meant to be a differential form $\omega$ on $X \times \mathbb{R}^k$ which has "no leg along $\mathbb{R}^k$". Another way to say this is that the family of forms on $X$ that is represented by some $\omega$ on $X \times \mathbb{R}^k$ is that which over a point $v \colon * \to \mathbb{RR}^k$ has the value $(id_X,v)^* \omega$. Under this [[pullback of differential forms]] any components of $\omega$ with "legs along $\mathbb{R}^k$" are identified with the 0 differential form

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof (sketch)

By def. \ref{Decohese}, def. \ref{ConcreteObjectsAndConcretification} and 
prop. \ref{DecohesOverASiteWithTerminalObject} the set of plots of $\mathbf{\Omega}^n(X)$ over $\mathbb{R}^k$ is the [[image]] of the [[function]]

$$
  \Omega^n(X \times \mathbb{R}^k)
  \simeq
   Hom_{Smooth0Type}(\mathbb{R}^k, [X,\Omega^n])
   \stackrel{\Gamma_{ \mathbb{R}^k, [X,\Omega^n] }}{\to}
   Hom_{Set}(\Gamma(\mathbb{R}^k), \Gamma [X, \Omega^n])
   \simeq
   Hom_{Set}(\mathbb{R}^k_s, \Omega^n(X))
  \,,
$$

where on the right $\mathbb{R}^k_s$ denotes, just for emphasis, the underlying set of $\mathbb{R}^k_s$. This function manifestly sends a smooth differential form $\omega \in \Omega^n(X \times \mathbb{R}^k)$ to the function from points $v$ of $\mathbb{R}^k$ to differential forms on $X$ given by

$$
  \omega \mapsto \left(v \mapsto  (id_X, v)^* \omega \right)
  \,.
$$

Under this function all components of differential forms with a "leg along" $\mathbb{R}^k$ are sent to the 0-form. Hence the image of this function is the collection of smooth forms on $X \times \mathbb{R}^k$ with "no leg along $\mathbb{R}^k$".

The premise in [The continuum real world line](#TheContinuumRealWorldLine) is now refined to

**Premise.** The abstract worldline of a [[fermionic particle]] is a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-[[odd line|graded]] [[formal manifold|formal neighbourhood]] $\mathbb{R}^{1|n}$ of the [[real line]], for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

For $n = 0$ this is again the real line $\mathbb{R}^{1|0} = \mathbb{R}$.
