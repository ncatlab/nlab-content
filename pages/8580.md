## About this page

This page is going to contain an introduction to aspects of [[differential geometry]] and their application in fundamental [[physics]]: the [[gauge theory]] appearing in the [[standard model of particle physics]] and the [[Riemannian geometry]] appearing in the [[standard model of cosmology]], as well as the [[symplectic geometry]] appearing in the [[quantization]] of both.

### Scope and perspective

The intended topic scope and readership of this page is much like that of the book ([Frankel](#Frankel)), only that here we make use of a more modern and more transparent conceptual toolbox. 

For instance where traditionally expositions of [[differential geometry]] proceed by generalizing the [[geometry]] of [[coordinate|coordinate systems]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ to _[[smooth manifolds]]_, here we instead begin by generalizing coordinate systems right away to _[[smooth spaces]]_, which happens to be both more expressive as well as actually much easier. Smooth manifolds are then introduced later as an intermediate notion, together with that of _[[diffeological spaces]]_. (Many of the constructions in [[differential geometry]] applied in [[physics]] do not actually need the notion of a smooth manifold, and, more importantly, for many notions in modern theoretical physics smooth manifolds are not actually sufficiently general.) But we will of course discuss plain manifolds, too.

In fact we introduce smooth manifolds only after we introduce _[[smooth groupoids]]_, which are differential geometric structures that are _still_ simpler than smooth manifolds, and of course even more expressive than smooth spaces. In fact, smooth groupoids are the very heart of the geometry of physics. Modern fundamental physics is all based on the "[[gauge symmetry|gauge principle]]" and mathematically this is essentially nothing but the theory of smooth groupoids. 

### Layers of exposition
 {#Layers}

We discuss each topic below in three stages, in three _layers_. 

1. The first layer, called **Layer Mod**, deals with concrete explicit  constructions as familiar from traditional textbooks on differential geometry and physics. This layer is supposed to be readable and useful all in itself and the reader who feels that this is all he or she wants to see can stick to this and ignore the other layers. In particular, while _Layer Mod_ does invoke the basic notion of a _[[category]]_ and of a _[[functor]]_ -- which are as simple as the notions of [[group]] or [[associative algebra|algebra]] --, it does not use any actual _[[category theory]]_. 
 {#LayerMod}

1. The second layer, called **Layer Sem**, makes explicit the ([[(infinity,1)-category theory|higher]]) [[category theory]] and ([[(infinity,1)-topos theory|higher]]) [[topos theory]] at work in the background. This puts the concrete constructions of _Layer Mod_ into a more general context and helps to see certain organizational patterns that underly the seemingly different phenomena. It provides some powerful theorems which _Layer Mod_ is secretly benefitting from. For instance this layer gives a systematic rule for generalizing everything at the beginning in _Layer Mod_ from ordinary [[differential geometry]] to what is called  _[[supergeometry]]_, which is the context in which [[fermion|fermionic]] [[particles]] are formalized: the [[matter]] constituents of the [[observable universe]].
 {#LayerSem}

1. The third layer, called **Layer Syn**, makes explict the expression of these phenomena in the [[logical framework|formal]] [[internal language]] of the [[topos]] of [[smooth spaces]] -- which is _[[dependent type theory|dependent]] [[type theory]]_ -- and of the [[(infinity,1)-topos|higher topos]] of [[smooth infinity-groupoid|smooth higher groupoids]] -- which is _[[homotopy type theory]]_. This makes more transparent various constructions in ([[(infinity,1)-topos theory|higher]]) [[topos theory]] used in _Layer Sem_, and in fact it provides 
a [[categorical semantics|natural construction principle]] for objects in a (higher) topos that model some intended _meaning_, which is precisely what [[mathematical physics]] is about.
This is meant for readers who enjoy seeing fundamental physics _naturally_ rooted in genuinely fundamental mathematics, in _[[natural deduction]]_, as it were. Everybody else should ignore this.
 {#LayerSyn}
 
**The three layers**

* **Layer Mod** -- [[concrete particular]]: [[models]]

* **Layer Sem** -- [[concrete general]]: [[categorical semantics]] in [[(infinity,1)-topos theory|higher]] [[topos theory]]

* **Layer Syn** -- [[abstract general]]: [[syntax]] in [[homotopy type theory|homotopy]]-[[type theory]]

## Coordinate systems
 {#CoordinateSystems}

Every kind of _[[geometry]]_ is modeled on a collection of [[generator|archetypical]] basic [[spaces]] and geometric [[homomorphisms]] between them. In [[differential geometry]] the archtypical spaces are the abstract standard [[Cartesian space|Cartesian coordinate systems]], denoted $\mathbb{R}^n$, in every [[dimension]] $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and the geometric homomorphism between them are [[smooth functions]] $\mathbb{R}^{n_1} \to \mathbb{R}^{n-1}$, hence smooth (and possiby degenerate) [[coordinate transformations]].

Here we discuss the central aspects of the nature of such abstract coordinate systems in themselves. At this point there are not yet coordinate systems _on_ some other space. That is instead the topic of the next section _[Smooth spaces](#SmoothSpaces)_.

### Layer Mod
 {#CoordinateSystemsLayerMod}

In this [Mod Layer ](#LayerMod) we discuss the [[concrete particulars]] of _[[coordinate systems]]_: the [[continuum real line]] $\mathbb{R}$, the [[Cartesian spaces]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ formed from it and the [[smooth functions]] between these.

#### The continuum real (world-)line
 {#TheContinuumRealWorldLine}

The fundamental premise of [[differential geometry]] as a model of [[geometry]] in [[physics]] is the following.

**Premise.** _The abstract [[worldline]] of any [[particle]] is modeled by the [[continuum]] [[real line]] $\mathbb{R}$._

This comes down to the following sequence of premises.

1. There is a [[linear ordering]] of the [[points]] on a [[worldline]]: in particular if we pick points at some intervals on the worldline we may label these in an order-preserving way by [[integers]]

   $\mathbb{Z}$.

1. These intervals may each be subdivided into $n$ smaller intervals, for each natural number $n$. Hence we may label points on the [[worldline]] in an order-preserving way by the [[rational numbers]]

   $\mathbb{Q}$.

1. This labeling is dense: every point on the worldline is the [[supremum]] of an [[inhabited set|inhabited]] [[bounded subset]] of such labels. This means that a [[worldline]] [[equivalence|is]] the _[[real line]]_, the [[continuum]] of [[real numbers]]

   $\mathbb{R}$.
  
The adjective "real" in "[[real number]]" is a historical shadow of the old idea that real numbers are related to _observed reality_, hence to [[physics]] in this way. The experimental success of this assumption shows that it is valid at least to very good approximation. 

Speculations are common that in a fully exact theory of [[quantum gravity]], currently unavailable, this assumption needs to be refined. 
For instance in _[[p-adic physics]]_ one explores the hypothesis that the relevant [[complete field|completion]] of the rational numbers as above is not the reals, but [[p-adic numbers]] $\mathbb{Q}_p$ for some [[prime number]] $p \in \mathbb{N}$. Or for example in the study of [[QFT on non-commutative spacetime]] one explore the idea that at small scales the smooth [[continuum]] is to be replaced by an object in [[noncommutative geometry]]. Combining these two ideas leads to the notion of [[non-commutative analytic space]] as a potential model for _[[space]]_ in [[physics]]. And so forth.

For the time being all this remains speculation and differential geometry based on the [[continuum]] [[real line]] remains the context of all fundamental [[model (in theoretical physics)|model building]] in physics related to observed [[phenomenology]]. Often it is argued that these speculations are necessitated by the very nature of [[quantum theory]] applied to [[gravity]]. But, at least so far, such statements are not actually supported by the standard theory of [[quantization]]:
we discuss below in _[Geometric quantization](GeometricQuantization)_ how not just [[classical physics]] but also [[quantum theory]], in the best modern version available, is entirely rooted in differential geometry based on the [[continuum]] [[real line]].

This is the motivation for studying models of physics in geometry modeled on the [[continuum]] [[real line]]. On the other hand, in all of what follows our discussion is set up such as to be _maximally independent_ of this specific choice (this is what _[[topos theory]]_ accomplishes for us, discussed below _[Smooth spaces -- Layer Sem](#SmoothSpacesLayerSem)_). If we do desire to consider another choice of archetypical spaces for the geometry of physics we can simply "change the [[site]]", as discussed [below](#SmoothSpacesLayerSem) and many of the constructions, propositions and theorems in the following will continue to hold. This is notably what we do below in _[Supergeometric coordinate systems](#SupergeometricCoordinateSystems)_ when we generalize the present discussion to a flavor of differential geometry that also formalizes the notion of [[fermion]] [[particles]]: "differential [[supergeometry]]."


#### Cartesian spaces
 {#CartesianSpaces}

###### Definition

An **[[open interval]]** in the [[set]] $\mathbb{R}$ of [[real numbers]]
is a [[subset]] of the form

$$
  (a,b) \coloneqq \{x \in \mathbb{R} | a \lt x \lt b\} \subset \mathbb{R}
$$

for $a \lt b \in \mathbb{R}$.

=--


+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A [[function]] of [[sets]] $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is called 

* a **[[continuous function]]** if for all $a \lt b \in \mathbb{R}$ the [[preimage]] $f^{-1}(a,b) \coloneqq \{x \in \mathbb{R} | a \lt f(x) \lt b\}$ is a [[disjoint union]] of open intervals;

* a **[[smooth function]]** if for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the $n$th [[derivative]] $f^{(n)} : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ exists and is a [[continuous function]].

=--

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the **[[Cartesian space]]** $\mathbb{R}^n$ is the set

$$
  \mathbb{R}^n = \{ (x^1 , \cdots, x^{n}) | x^i \in \mathbb{R} \}
$$

of $n$-[[tuples]] of [[real numbers]]. For $1 \leq k \leq n$ write

$$
  i^k : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^n
$$

for the [[function]] such that $i^k(x) = (0, \cdots, 0,x,0,\cdots,0)$ is the [[tuple]] whose $k$th entry is $x$ and all whose other entries are $0 \in \mathbb{R}$; and write

$$
  \mathbb{p}^k : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}
$$

for the function such that $p^k(x^1, \cdots, x^n) = x^k$.

A **[[homomorphism]]** of Cartesian spaces is a [[smooth function]]

$$
  f : \mathbb{R}^{n_1} \to \mathbb{R}^{n_2}
  \,,
$$

hence a [[function]] $f : \mathbb{R}^{n_1} \to \mathbb{R}^{n_2}$ such that all [[partial derivatives]] exist and are [[continuous map|continuous]] (...).

=--

* [[coordinate system]] = [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$, for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$;

[[homomorphism]] of coordinate systems = [[smooth function]]
$\mathbb{R}^{n_1} \to \mathbb{R}^{n_2}$

#### Properties of smooth functions
 {#PropertiesOfSmoothFunctions}

basic facts about [[smooth functions]]

* [[Hadamard lemma]]

* [[Borel's theorem]]

* existence of [[bump functions]] and [[partitions of unity]]

### Layer Sem

coordinate systems form a [[category]] called [[CartSp]]

* [[objects]] are coordinate systems

* [[morphisms]] are [[coordinate transformations]] = smooth functions

the [[opposite category]] is [[CartSp]]${}^{op}$

a [[functor]]  $X : CartSp^{op} \to Set$ (a "[[presheaf]]") is

1. for each coordinate system $U$ a [[set]] $X(U)$

1. for each [[coordinate transformation]] $f : \mathbb{R}^{n_1} \to \mathbb{R}^{n_2}$ a [[function]] $X(f) : X(\mathbb{R}^{n_2}) \to X(\mathbb{R}^{n_2})$

such that 

1. [[identity]] is respected $X(id_{\mathbb{R}^n}) = id_{X(\mathbb{R}^n)}$;

1. [[composition]] is respected $X(f_2)\circ X(f_1) = X(f_2 \circ f_1)$

### Layer Syn

We discuss a bit the [[internal language]] of a [[category]] such as [[CartSp]] above, which is a flavor of [[type theory]].

An [[object]] $X \in \mathcal{C}$ in a [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$ we will also denote by the [[sequent]]

$$
  \vdash \; X \colon Type
$$

and say that it is a _[[type]]_. 

For $* \in \mathcal{C}$ the [[terminal object]], an [[element]] of $X$, hence a [[morphism]] $x : * \to X$ we denote by the [[sequent]]

$$
  \vdash \; x \colon X
  \,.
$$

Notice that any $X \in \mathcal{C}$ becomes the [[terminal object]] in the [[slice category]] $\mathcal{C}_{/X}$.

Let $A \to X$ be any morphism in $\mathcal{C}$, regarded as an object $A \in \mathcal{C}_{/X}$. The [[syntax]] for this is

$$
  x \colon X \;\vdash \;  A \colon Type
$$

and this is called a _[[dependent type]]_.

An element of $A$ in $\mathcal{C}_{/X}$ is a [[generalized element]] of $A$ in $\mathcal{C}$, namely a morphism $X \to A$ which fits into a [[commuting diagram]]

$$
  \array{
    X &&\to&& A
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{id_X}}\earrow && \swarrow_{}
    \\
    && X
  }
$$

The [[syntax]] for this is 

$$
  x\colon X \;\vdash\; a : A
$$

and this is called a [[dependent term|term depending on]] the [[free variable]] $x$ of [[type]] $X$.

## Smooth spaces

* [[smooth space]] = [[type|thing]] into which we can throw [[coordinate systems]] ([[motivation for sheaves, cohomology and higher stacks|conceptual exposition]])

  [[functor]] $X : CartSp^{op} \to Set$ such that coordinate patches glue

* [[smooth manifold]] = [[smooth space]] that is [[covering|locally]] _[[equivalence|equivalent]]_ to a [[coordinate system]]

* [[diffeological space]] = [[smooth space]] such that every coordinate labels a [[point]] in the space (which need not be in a general smooth space)

## Differential forms

* [[smooth function]] on [[coordinate system]] = [[smooth function]] $\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$

* [[smooth function]] on [[smooth space]] $X$ = one smooth function $f|_U$ on each [[coordinate chart]] $U \to X$ such that they fit together under [[coordinate transformation|change of coordinates]]

then

* [[differential form|differential 1-form]] on [[coordinate system]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ = $n$ smooth functions $\{f_i\}_{i = 1}^n$, written $\omega = f_1 \mathbf{d}x^1 + f_2 \mathbf{d}x^2 + \cdots + f_n \mathbf{d}x^n$

  ([[infinitesimal space|infinitsimal]] [[measure]] of [[length]])

* [[differential form|differential 1-form]] on [[smooth space]] $X$ = one $\omega|_U$ for each [[coordinate chart]] $U \to X$ such that these fit together under [[coordinate transformation|change of coordinates]]. 

then

* [[differential form]] on [[coordinate system]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ = element of [[exterior algebra]]...

the smooth space of differential $n$-forms is $\Omega^n(-)$


the [[Yoneda lemma]]: $\Omega^n(\mathbb{R}^n) = \{\mathbb{R}^n \to \Omega^n(-)\}$

observe: $\Omega^0(-) = \mathbb{R}$


## Differentiation

* [[derivative]]

* [[de Rham differential]]: map of smooth spaces $\mathbf{d} : \Omega^n(-) \to \Omega^{n+1}(-)$

for instance [[electromagnetic potential]]

$$
  A = \phi \mathbf{d}t + A_1 \mathbf{d}x^1 + A_2 \mathbf{d}x^2 + A_3 \mathbf{d}x^3
$$

then [[field strength]] is

$$
  F 
    \coloneqq
  \mathbf{d}A 
    = 
   E_1 \mathbf{d}t \wedge \mathbf{d}x^1 
    + 
   E_2 \mathbf{d}t \wedge \mathbf{d}x^2 
    + 
   E_3 \mathbf{d}t \wedge \mathbf{d}x^3
    + 
    B_1 \mathbf{d}x^2 \wedge \mathbf{d}x^3 
    + 
    B_2 \mathbf{d}x^3 \wedge \mathbf{d}x^1 
    + 
    B_3 \mathbf{d}x^1 \wedge \mathbf{d}x^2 
$$

with 

$$
  E_i = \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x^i}
$$

and

$$
  B_1 = \frac{\partial A_2}{\partial x^3} - \frac{\partial A_3}{\partial x^2}
$$

etc

for

$$
  A,A' : X \to \Omega^1(-)
$$

a [[gauge transformation]] $A \to A'$
is $\lambda : X \to \mathbb{R}$ with

$$
  A' = A + \mathbf{d} \lambda
$$




first 2 of 4 [[Maxwell equations]]: $\mathbf{d} F = 0$

(the other 2 below in Riemannian geometry)

## Variational calculus

for instance [[variational calculus]]

[[action functional]] for [[particle]] on [[spacetime]] $X$ ("[[sigma-model]]")

$$
  S : [S^1, X] \to \mathbb{R}
$$

variation is

$$
  \mathbf{d}S : [S^1, X] \stackrel{S}{\to} \mathbb{R}
  \stackrel{\mathbf{d}}{\to}
  \Omega^1(-)
$$

* [[Euler-Lagrange equations]]

## Smooth groupoids

$$
  X_1 \stackrel{\overset{d_1}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{s_0}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{d_0}{\to}}}
  X_0
$$

$$
  \array{
    && X^{\Delta^2}
    \\
    &{}^{\mathllap{\exists}}\nearrow & \downarrow
    \\
    U &\stackrel{}{\to}& X^{\Lambda^2_i}
  }
$$

Example: $X$ a [[smooth space]] and $G$ a [[smooth group]] and 

$\rho : X \times G \to X$ an [[action]] then

[[action groupoid]]

$$
  X \sslash G = 
  \left(
    X \times G \stackrel{\overset{\rho}{\to}}{\underset{p_1}{\to}}
    X
  \right)
$$

## Principal bundles

any [[Lie group]] $G$ induces its [[delooping]] [[Lie groupoid]] 
  
$$
  \mathbf{B}G
  =
  * \sslash G
  = 
  \left(
     G \stackrel{\to}{\to} * 
  \right)
  \,.
$$

also

$$
  \mathbf{E}G
  =
  G \sslash G
  = 
  \left(
     G\times G \stackrel{\overset{\cdot}{\to}}{\underset{p_1}{\to}} G 
  \right)
  \,.
$$

canonical map

$$
  \array{
    \mathbf{E}G
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbf{B}G
  }
$$

[[universal principal bundle]]

for $X$ a [[smooth space]] a $G$-[[principal bundle]] over $X$ is a smooth space $P$ with map $P \to X$ such that there is a diagram 

$$
  \array{ 
     P &\stackrel{\simeq}{\leftarrow}& \tilde P &\to& \mathbf{E}G
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow &pb& \downarrow
     \\
     X &\stackrel{\simeq}{\leftarrow}& \tilde X &\underset{g}{\to}& \mathbf{B}G
  }
$$

where the left horizontal morphisms are [[weak equivalences]]
and the right square is a [[pullback]]

## Smooth manifolds


A [[smooth manifold]] of [[dimension]] $n$ 

a [[smooth space]] with an [[atlas]] 

$$
  \{ \mathbb{R}^n \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi_i^{-1}}{\to} U_i \hookrightarrow X\}
$$ 

of [[coordinate charts]]. On each overlap $U_i \cap U_j$ of two charts, the [[partial derivatives]] of the corresponding [[coordinate transformations]]

$$
  \phi_j\circ \phi_i^{-1}
  : 
  U_i \cap U_j \subset \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n
$$

form the [[Jacobian matrix]] of [[smooth functions]]

$$
  ((\lambda_{i j})^{\mu}{}_{\mu})
  \coloneqq
  \left[\frac{d}{d x^\nu} \phi_j \circ \phi_i^{-1} (x^\mu)
  \right]
  :
  U_i \cap U_j 
  \to 
  GL_n
$$

with values in invertible [[matrices]], hence in the
[[general linear group]] $GL(n)$. By construction (by the [[chain rule]]), these functions satisfy on triple overlaps of coordinate charts the [[matrix product]] equations

$$
  (\lambda_{i j})^\mu{}_\lambda (\lambda_{j k})^\lambda{}_{\nu} 
  = 
  (\lambda_{i k})^\mu{}_{\nu}
  \,,
$$

(here and in the following sums over an index appearing upstairs and downstairs are explicit)

hence the equation

$$
  \lambda_{i j} \cdot \lambda_{j k} = \lambda_{i k}
$$

in the [[group]] $C^\infty(U_i \cap U_j \cap U_k, GL(n))$ of smooth $GL(n)$-valued functions on the chart overlaps.

This is the _[[cocycle]] condition_ for a smooth [[Cech cohomology|Cech cocycle]] in degree 1 with coefficients in $GL(n)$ (precisely: with coefficients in the [[sheaf]] of [[smooth functions]] with values in $GL(n)$ ). We write

$$
  [(\lambda_{i j})] \in H^1_{smooth}(X, GL_n)
  \,.
$$

Formulated as [[smooth groupoids]]

* $X$ itself is a [[Lie groupoid]] $(X \stackrel{\to}{\to} X)$ with trivial morphism structure;

* from the atlas $\{U_i \to X\}$ we get the corresponding [[Cech groupoid]] 
  $$
    C(\{U_i\}) = 
    (\coprod_{i, j} U_i \cap U_j \stackrel{\to}{\to} \coprod_i U_i)
    = 
    \left\{
      \array{
         && (x,j)
         \\
         & \nearrow &=& \searrow
         \\
        (x,i) &&\to&& (x,k)
      }
      \;\;\;
      for\, x \in U_i \cap U_j \cap U_k
    \right\}
    \,,
  $$

  whose objects are the points in the atlas, with morphisms identifying lifts of a point in $X$ to different charts of the atlas;



## Tangent bundle


The above situation is neatly encoded in the existence of a [[diagram]] of Lie groupoids of the form

$$
  \array{
     C(\{U_i\}) &\stackrel{\lambda}{\to}& \mathbf{B} GL(n).
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\simeq}}\downarrow
     \\
     X
  }
  \,,
$$

where

* the left morphism is [[stalk]]-wise (around small enough [[neighbourhoods]] of each point) an [[equivalence of groupoids]] (we make this more precise in a moment);

* the horizontal functor has as components the functions $\lambda_{i j}$ and its functoriality is the cocycle condition $\lambda_{i j} \cdot \lambda_{j k} = \lambda_{i k}$.


A [[natural transformation|transformation]] of smooth functors $\lambda_1 \Rightarrow \lambda_2 : C(\{U_i\}) \to \mathbf{B} GL(n)$ is precisely a [[coboundary]] between two such cocycles.

## $G$-Structure

$$
  \mathbf{B}G \to \mathbf{B}K
$$

given a $K$-[[principal bundle]]

$$
  \array{
    \tilde X &\to &\mathbf{B}K
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    \\
    X
  }
$$

a [[reduction of the structure group]] along $G \to K$ is

$$
  \array{
    \tilde X &&\to&& \mathbf{B}G
    \\
    & \searrow &\swArrow_{e}& \swarrow
    \\

  \int_{\Sigma, U} : \Omega^n(\Sigma\times U) \to \Omega^{n-k}(U)
  \,.
$$

## Transgression

[[transgression]] of [[differential forms]] to [[mapping space]] is the composite

$$
  \int_\Sigma [\Sigma,-]
  : 
  \Omega^n(X) \to \Omega^{n-k}([\Sigma,X])
$$

$$
  (X \stackrel{\omega}{\to} \Omega^n(-)) \in \Omega^n(X)
$$

to

$$
  \int_{\Sigma} [\Sigma,\omega]
   :
  [\Sigma, X] \stackrel{[\Sigma, \omega]}{\to}  \Omega^{n-k}(-)
$$

for instance [[action functional]] for [[electron]] in [[electromagnetic field]] $A$ is $S_{em} = \int_{S^1} [S^1, A]$

$$
  \int_{S^1} [S^1, A]
  : 
  [S^1, X]
    \stackrel{[S^1, A]}{\to}
  [S^1 , \Omega^1]
    \stackrel{\int_{S^1}}{\to}
  \Omega^0(-)
  = 
  \mathbb{R}
$$

## Circle-principal connections

[[Dirac charge quantization]] says that the
[[electromagnetic field]] is only locally in general a map

$$
  \array{
    && \Omega^1(-)
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{A}}\nearrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mathbf{d}}}
    \\
    X &\stackrel{\omega}{\to}& \Omega^2_{cl}
  }
$$

globally it is instead a map

$$
  \array{
    && \mathbf{B}U(1)_{conn}
    \\
    & {}^{\nabla}\nearrow & \downarrow^{F_{(-)}}
    \\
    X &\stackrel{\omega}{\to}& \Omega^2_{cl}
  }
$$

where

$$
  \array{  
    \mathbf{B}U(1)_{conn} &\stackrel{F_{(-)}}{\to}& \Omega^2_{cl}
    \\
    \downarrow &pb& \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbf{B}U(1)_{diff} &\to& \Omega^{1 \leq \bullet \leq 2}_{cl}
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    \\
    \mathbf{B}U(1)
  }
$$

[[circle bundle with connection]]

the [[smooth groupoid]] is

$$
  \mathbf{B}U(1)_{conn}
  =
  \Omega^1(-) \sslash U(1)
$$

quotient of $\Omega^1(-)$ by $U(1)$-[[gauge transformations]]

for

$$
  A,A' : X \to \Omega^1(-)
$$

a [[gauge transformation]] $A \to A'$
is $\lambda : X \to U(1)$ with

$$
  A' = A + \mathbf{d} log \lambda
