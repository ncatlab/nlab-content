## Idea

This page is going to contain an introduction to aspects of [[differential geometry]] and their application in fundamental [[physics]]: the [[gauge theory]] appearing in the [[standard model of particle physics]] and the [[Riemannian geometry]] appearing in the [[standard model of cosmology]], as well as the [[symplectic geometry]] appearing in the [[quantization]] of both.

The intended topic scope and readership of the first part of this page is much like that of the book ([Frankel](#Frankel)), with a similar title as this page, only that here we make use of a more modern and more transparent conceptual toolbox. For instance where traditionally expositions of [[differential geometry]] proceed by generalizing the [[geometry]] of "[[Cartesian spaces]]" $\mathbb{R}^n$ ([[coordinate|coordinate systems]]) to _[[smooth manifolds]]_, here we instead begin by generalizing them right away to _[[smooth spaces]]_, which happens to be both more expressive as well as actually much easier. Smooth manifolds are then introduced later as an intermediate notion, together with that of _[[diffeological spaces]]_. (Many of the constructions in [[differential geometry]] applied in [[physics]] do not actually need the notion of a smooth manifold, and, more importantly, for many notions in modern theoretical physics smooth manifolds are not actually sufficiently general.) But we will of course discuss plain manifolds, too.


## Coordinate systems

* [[coordinate system]] = [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$, for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$;

[[homomorphism]] of coordinate systems = [[smooth function]]
$\mathbb{R}^{n_1} \to \mathbb{R}^{n_2}$

coordinate systems form a [[category]] called [[CartSp]]

* [[objects]] are coordinate systems

* [[morphisms]] are [[coordinate transformations]] = smooth functions

the [[opposite category]] is [[CartSp]]${}^{op}$

a [[functor]]  $X : CartSp^{op} \to Set$ (a "[[presheaf]]") is

1. for each coordinate system $U$ a [[set]] $X(U)$

1. for each [[coordinate transformation]] $f : \mathbb{R}^{n_1} \to \mathbb{R}^{n_2}$ a [[function]] $X(f) : X(\mathbb{R}^{n_2}) \to X(\mathbb{R}^{n_2})$

such that 

1. [[identity]] is respected $X(id_{\mathbb{R}^n}) = id_{X(\mathbb{R}^n)}$;

1. composition is respected $X(f_2)\circ X(f_1) = X(f_2 \circ f_1)$

## Smooth spaces

* [[smooth space]] = [[type|thing]] into which we can throw [[coordinate systems]] ([[motivation for sheaves, cohomology and higher stacks|conceptual exposition]])

  [[functor]] $X : CartSp^{op} \to Set$ such that coordinate patches glue

* [[smooth manifold]] = [[smooth space]] that is [[covering|locally]] _[[equivalence|equivalent]]_ to a [[coordinate system]]

* [[diffeological space]] = [[smooth space]] such that every coordinate labels a [[point]] in the space (which need not be in a general smooth space)

$\{$[[coordinate systems]]$\}$ 
 $\hookrightarrow$
$\{$[[smooth manifolds]]$\}$ 
 $\hookrightarrow$
$\{$[[diffeological spaces]]$\}$ 
 $\hookrightarrow$
$\{$[[smooth spaces]]$\}$ 
 $\hookrightarrow$
$\{$[[smooth groupoids]]$\}$ 
 $\hookrightarrow \cdots $

[[mapping spaces]]: for $\Sigma, X$ [[smooth spaces]], the [[mapping space]] $[\Sigma,X]$ is defined as the [[smooth space]] whose $U$-[[coordinate charts]] are $\mathbf{H}(\Sigma \times U ,X)$.


Example: [[smooth loop space]] $L X = [S^1, X]$ (on the horizon: [[path integral]])

## Differential forms

* [[smooth function]] on [[coordinate system]] = [[smooth function]] $\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$

* [[smooth function]] on [[smooth space]] $X$ = one smooth function $f|_U$ on each [[coordinate chart]] $U \to X$ such that they fit together under [[coordinate transformation|change of coordinates]]

then

* [[differential form|differential 1-form]] on [[coordinate system]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ = $n$ smooth functions $\{f_i\}_{i = 1}^n$, written $\omega = f_1 \mathbf{d}x^1 + f_2 \mathbf{d}x^2 + \cdots + f_n \mathbf{d}x^n$

  ([[infinitesimal space|infinitsimal]] [[measure]] of [[length]])

* [[differential form|differential 1-form]] on [[smooth space]] $X$ = one $\omega|_U$ for each [[coordinate chart]] $U \to X$ such that these fit together under [[coordinate transformation|change of coordinates]]. 

then

* [[differential form]] on [[coordinate system]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ = element of [[exterior algebra]]...

the smooth space of differential $n$-forms is $\Omega^n(-)$


the [[Yoneda lemma]]: $\Omega^n(\mathbb{R}^n) = \{\mathbb{R}^n \to \Omega^n(-)\}$

observe: $\Omega^0(-) = \mathbb{R}$


## Differentiation

* [[derivative]]

* [[de Rham differential]]: map of smooth spaces $\mathbf{d} : \Omega^n(-) \to \Omega^{n+1}(-)$

for instance [[electromagnetic potential]]

$$
  A = \phi \mathbf{d}t + A_1 \mathbf{d}x^1 + A_2 \mathbf{d}x^2 + A_3 \mathbf{d}x^3
$$

then [[field strength]] is

$$
  F 
    \coloneqq
  \mathbf{d}A 
    = 
   E_1 \mathbf{d}t \wedge \mathbf{d}x^1 
    + 
   E_2 \mathbf{d}t \wedge \mathbf{d}x^2 
    + 
   E_3 \mathbf{d}t \wedge \mathbf{d}x^3
    + 
    B_1 \mathbf{d}x^2 \wedge \mathbf{d}x^3 
    + 
    B_2 \mathbf{d}x^3 \wedge \mathbf{d}x^1 
    + 
    B_3 \mathbf{d}x^1 \wedge \mathbf{d}x^2 
$$

with 

$$
  E_i = \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x^i}
$$

and

$$
  B_1 = \frac{\partial A_2}{\partial x^3} - \frac{\partial A_3}{\partial x^2}
$$

...

first 2 of 4 [[Maxwell equations]]: $\mathbf{d} F = 0$

(the other 2 below in Riemannian geometry)

for instance [[variational calculus]]

[[action functional]] for [[particle]] on [[spacetime]] $X$ ("[[sigma-model]]")

$$
  S : [S^1, X] \to \mathbb{R}
$$

variation is

$$
  \mathbf{d}S : [S^1, X] \stackrel{S}{\to} \mathbb{R}
  \stackrel{\mathbf{d}}{\to}
  \Omega^1
$$


## Integration 

$\Sigma$ [[compact topological space|compact]] [[orientation|oriented]] [[smooth manifold]] of [[dimension]] $k$

[[integration of differential forms]] is map of smooth spaces

$$
  \int_{\Sigma} : [\Sigma, \Omega^n(-)] \to \Omega^{n-k}(-)
$$

over a [[coordinate chart]] $U$ this sends

$$
  \int_{\Sigma, U} : \Omega^n(\Sigma\times U) \to \Omega^{n-k}(U)
  \,.
$$

## Transgression

[[transgression]] to [[mapping space]] is the composite

$$
  \int_\Sigma [\Sigma,-]
  : 
  \Omega^n(X) \to \Omega^{n-k}([\Sigma,X])
$$

$$
  (X \stackrel{\omega}{\to} \Omega^n(-)) \in \Omega^n(X)
$$

to

$$
  \int_{\Sigma} [\Sigma,\omega]
   :
  [\Sigma, X] \stackrel{[\Sigma, \omega]}{\to}  \to \Omega^{n-k}(-)
$$

for instance [[action functional]] for [[electron]] in [[electromagnetic field]] $A$ is $S_{em} = \int_{S^1} [S^1, A]$

$$
  \int_{S^1} [S^1, A]
  : 
  [S^1, X]
    \stackrel{[S^1, A]}{\to}
  [S^1 , \Omega^1]
    \stackrel{\int_{S^1}}{\to}
  \Omega^0(-)
  = 
  \mathbb{R}
$$


* [[Stokes theorem]]


## Smooth groupoids

$$
  X_1 \stackrel{\overset{d_1}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{s_0}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{d_0}{\to}}}
  X_0
$$

$$
  \array{
    && X^{\Delta^2}
    \\
    &{}^{\mathllap{\exists}}\nearrow & \downarrow
    \\
    U &\stackrel{}{\to}& X^{\Lambda^2_i}
  }
$$

## Principal bundles

any [[Lie group]] $G$ induces its [[delooping]] [[Lie groupoid]] 
  
$$
  \mathbf{B}G
  = 
  \left(
     G \stackrel{\to}{\to} * 
  \right)
  \,.
$$

also

$$
  \mathbf{E}G
  = 
  \left(
     G\times G \stackrel{\overset{\cdot}{\to}}{\underset{p_1}{\to}} G 
  \right)
  \,.
$$

canonical map

$$
  \array{
    \mathbf{E}G
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbf{B}G
  }
$$

[[universal principal bundle]]

for $X$ a [[smooth space]] a $G$-[[principal bundle]] over $X$ is a smooth space $P$ with map $P \to X$ such that there is a diagram 

$$
  \array{ 
     P &\stackrel{\simeq}{\leftarrow}& \tilde P &\to& \mathbf{E}G
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     X &\stackrel{\simeq}{\leftarrow}& \tilde X &\stackrel{g}{\to}& \mathbf{B}G
  }
$$

where the left horizontal morphisms are [[weak equivalences]]
and the right square is a [[pullback]]
## Smooth manifolds


A [[smooth manifold]] of [[dimension]] $n$ 

a [[smooth space]] with an [[atlas]] 

$$
  \{ \mathbb{R}^n \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi_i^{-1}}{\to} U_i \hookrightarrow X\}
$$ 

of [[coordinate charts]]. On each overlap $U_i \cap U_j$ of two charts, the [[partial derivatives]] of the corresponding [[coordinate transformations]]

$$
  \phi_j\circ \phi_i^{-1}
  : 
  U_i \cap U_j \subset \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n
$$

form the [[Jacobian matrix]] of [[smooth functions]]

$$
  ((\lambda_{i j})^{\mu}{}_{\mu})
  \coloneqq
  \left[\frac{d}{d x^\nu} \phi_j \circ \phi_i^{-1} (x^\mu)
  \right]
  :
  U_i \cap U_j 
  \to 
  GL_n
$$

with values in invertible [[matrices]], hence in the
[[general linear group]] $GL(n)$. By construction (by the [[chain rule]]), these functions satisfy on triple overlaps of coordinate charts the [[matrix product]] equations

$$
  (\lambda_{i j})^\mu{}_\lambda (\lambda_{j k})^\lambda{}_{\nu} 
  = 
  (\lambda_{i k})^\mu{}_{\nu}
  \,,
$$

(here and in the following sums over an index appearing upstairs and downstairs are explicit)

hence the equation

$$
  \lambda_{i j} \cdot \lambda_{j k} = \lambda_{i k}
$$

in the [[group]] $C^\infty(U_i \cap U_j \cap U_k, GL(n))$ of smooth $GL(n)$-valued functions on the chart overlaps.

This is the _[[cocycle]] condition_ for a smooth [[Cech cohomology|Cech cocycle]] in degree 1 with coefficients in $GL(n)$ (precisely: with coefficients in the [[sheaf]] of [[smooth functions]] with values in $GL(n)$ ). We write

$$
  [(\lambda_{i j})] \in H^1_{smooth}(X, GL_n)
  \,.
$$

Formulated as [[smooth groupoids]]

* $X$ itself is a [[Lie groupoid]] $(X \stackrel{\to}{\to} X)$ with trivial morphism structure;

* from the atlas $\{U_i \to X\}$ we get the corresponding [[Cech groupoid]] 
  $$
    C(\{U_i\}) = 
    (\coprod_{i, j} U_i \cap U_j \stackrel{\to}{\to} \coprod_i U_i)
    = 
    \left\{
      \array{
         && (x,j)
         \\
         & \nearrow &=& \searrow
         \\
        (x,i) &&\to&& (x,k)
      }
      \;\;\;
      for\, x \in U_i \cap U_j \cap U_k
    \right\}
    \,,
  $$

  whose objects are the points in the atlas, with morphisms identifying lifts of a point in $X$ to different charts of the atlas;



## Tangent bundle


The above situation is neatly encoded in the existence of a [[diagram]] of Lie groupoids of the form

$$
  \array{
     C(\{U_i\}) &\stackrel{\lambda}{\to}& \mathbf{B} GL(n).
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\simeq}}\downarrow
     \\
     X
  }
  \,,
$$

where

* the left morphism is [[stalk]]-wise (around small enough [[neighbourhoods]] of each point) an [[equivalence of groupoids]] (we make this more precise in a moment);

* the horizontal functor has as components the functions $\lambda_{i j}$ and its functoriality is the cocycle condition $\lambda_{i j} \cdot \lambda_{j k} = \lambda_{i k}$.


A [[natural transformation|transformation]] of smooth functors $\lambda_1 \Rightarrow \lambda_2 : C(\{U_i\}) \to \mathbf{B} GL(n)$ is precisely a [[coboundary]] between two such cocycles.

## $G$-Structure

$$
  \mathbf{B}G \to \mathbf{B}K
$$

given a $K$-[[principal bundle]]

$$
  \array{
    \tilde X &\to &\mathbf{B}K
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    \\
    X
  }
$$

a [[reduction of the structure group]] along $G \to K$ is

$$
  \array{
    \tilde X &&\to&& \mathbf{B}G
    \\
    & \searrow &\swArrow_{e}& \swarrow
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}K
  }
$$




## Riemannian geometry

[[reduction of the structure group]] along

$\mathbf{B}O(n) \to \mathbf{B}GL(n)$

$$
  \array{
    \tilde X &&\to&& \mathbf{B}O(n)
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{\vdash T \Sigma}}\searrow &\swArrow_{e}& \swarrow
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}GL(n)
  }
$$

$e$ is [[vielbein]]: definition of an [[orthonormal frame]]
at each point
