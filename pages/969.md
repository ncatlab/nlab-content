The **localization** of a [[category]] $C$ at a class of [[morphism]]s $W$ is the universal solution to making the morphisms in $W$ into [[isomorphism]]s; it is written $C[W^{-1}]$ or $W^{-1}C$.

This (perhaps confusing) terminology is by analogy with localization of rings, and also gives its name to [[Bousfield localization]] of [[model category|model categories]].  In 2-categorical language, $C[W^{-1}]$ is the [[coinverter]] of the canonical natural transformation $s\to t$, where $s,t:W\to C$ are the "source" and "target" functors and $W$ is considered as a full subcategory of the [[arrow category]] $C ^{\mathbf{2}}$.

If $C$ is [[large category|large]], then the existence of $C[W^{-1}]$ may depend on [[foundations]], and it will not necessarily be [[locally small category|locally small]] even if $C$ is.  The tools of [[homotopy theory]], and in particular [[model category|model categories]], can be used to address this question.
