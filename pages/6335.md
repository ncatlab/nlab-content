## Idea

In [[physics]] the word _mechanics_ refers essentially to every formalization of [[dynamics]]. Often the use of the word it may be restricted to mean the dynamics of point [[particle]]s or [[rigid body dynamics]].

Historically one distinguishes between _[[classical mechanics]]_ and _[[quantum mechanics]]_ . The full theory of dynamics is nature is given by quantum mechanics, but classical mechanics (named after its full development at the end of the 19th century, before the insights that led to its refinement to quantum mechanics) provides an accurate approximation for "macroscopic" or otherwise "large" systems.
