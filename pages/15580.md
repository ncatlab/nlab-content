## Definition

For $G$ an [[abelian group]], then the _Moore spectrum_ $S G$ (often $M G$) of $G$ is the [[spectrum]] characterized by having the following [[homotopy groups]]:

1. $\pi_{\lt 0} S G = 0$;

1. $\pi_0(S G) = G$;

1. $H_{\gt 0}(S G,\mathbb{Z}) = \pi_{\gt 0}(S G \wedge H \mathbb{Z}) = 0$.

Here $H \mathbb{Z}$ is the [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum]] of the [[integers]].

## Properties

### Bousfield localization at Moore spectra

An basic special case of $E$-[[Bousfield localization of spectra]] is given by $E = S A$ the Moore spectrum of an [[abelian group]] $A$. For $A = \mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$ this is [[p-localization]] and for $A = \mathbb{F}_p$ this is [[p-completion]].

###### Proposition

For $A_1$ and $A_2$ two [[abelian groups]] then the following are equivalent

1. the [[Bousfield localization of spectra|Bousfield localizations]] at their Moore spectra are equivalent 

   $$
     L_{S A_1} \simeq L_{S A_2}
     \,;
   $$

1. $A_1$ and $A_2$ have the same _type of acyclicity_, meaning that 
 
   1. every [[prime number]] $p$ is invertible in $A_1$ precisely if it is in $A_2$;

   1. $A_1$ is a [[torsion group]] precisely if $A_2$ is.

recalled e.g. in ([VanKoughnett 13, prop. 4.2](#VanKoughnett13)).

This means that given an abelian group $A$ then 

* either $A$ is torsion, then 

  $$
    L_{S A} \simeq L_{S \mathbb{Z}[I^{-1}]}
    \,,
  $$ 

  where $I$ is the set of primes invertible in $A$ and $\mathbb{Z}[I^{-1}] \hookrightarrow \mathbb{Q}$ is the [[localization of a ring|localization]] at these primes of the [[integers]];

* or $A$ is torsion, then 
    
  $$
   L_{S A }\simeq L_{S(\oplus_q \mathbb{F}_q )  }
   \,,
  $$

  where the [[direct sum]] is over all [[cyclic groups]] of order $q$ for $q$ a prime not invertible in $A$.



### Serre's theorem
  {#SerreTheorem}

* For $\mathbb{Q}$ the [[rational numbers]] there is an equivalence $S \mathbb{Q} \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} H \mathbb{Q}$ between the Moore spectrum and the [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum]]. (e.g. [Banagl 10, p. 6](#Banagl10))
