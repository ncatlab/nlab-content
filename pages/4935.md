## Idea


For $(X,g)$ a [[Riemannian manifold]] and $p \in X$ a point, the **geodesic flow** at $p$ is the map defined on an open neighbourhood of the origin in $(T_p X ) \times \mathbb{R}$ that sends $(v,r)$ to the endpoint of the [[geodesic]] that starts with tangent vector $v$ at $p$ and has length $r$.

###### Definition

For $p \in P$ a point, the **injectivity radius** $inj_p \in \mathbb{R}$ is the [[supremum]] over all values of $r \in \mathbb{R}$ such that the geodesic flow starting at $p$ with radius $r$ $\exp(-) : B_r(T_p X) \to X$ is a [[diffeomorphism]] onto its image.

The injectivity radius of $X$ is the infimum of the injectivity radii at each point.

## Properties

### Properties of the injectivity radius

+-- {: .un_proposition}
###### Proposition

The injectivity radius is 

* either equal to half the length of the smalled periodic geodesic,

* or equal to the smallest distance between two conjugate points.

=--

This appears for instance as scholium 91 in ([Berger](#Berger)).



### Lower bounds on the injectivity radius


There are several lower boundas on the [injectivity radius](#InjectivityRadius) of a Riemannian manifold.

+-- {: .un_proposition}
###### Proposition

The convexity radius is always less than or equal to half of the injectivity radius:

$$
  conv (X,g) \leq \frac{1}{2} inj(X,g)
  \,.
$$

=--

This appears for instance as proposition IX.6.1 in [Chavel](#Chavel), where it is attributed to M. Berger (1976). In ([Berger](#Berger)) it is proposition 95. 



Let $R$ be the [[Riemann curvature]] tensor of $g$. For $p \in X$ the [[sectional curvature]] of a plane spanned by vectors $v,w \in T_p X$ is

$$
  K(v,w) :=
  \frac{R(v,w,v,w)}{g(v,v)g(w,w) - g(v,w)^2}
  \,.
$$

Say that $(X,g)$ is **complete** if, equivalently,  

* with the [[distance]] function $X$ is a [[complete metric space]];

* $(X,g)$ is geodesically complete in that for all $v \in T_p X$ the flow $t \mapsto \exp_p(t v)$ exists for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$.

###### Theorem

Let $(X,g)$ be complete and such that

1. the [[absolute value]] of the sectional curvature at all points is bounded from above;

1. the [[volume]] of the geodesic unit ball at all points is bounded from below.

Then the injectivity radius is positive.

###### Theorem

Every [[paracompact manifold]] admits a complete [[Riemannian metric]] with bounded absolute sectional curvature and positive injectivity radius.
