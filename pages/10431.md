Topological insulator is a [[topological state of matter]]
which behaves as insulator in the bulk but has conducting edge states on the surface. More specifically, it is $U(1)$ and time reversal symmetry protected state of matter with trivial [[topological order]], which behaves as insulator in the bulk but has conducting edge states on the surface if the time reversal symmetry is not broken on the surface.

(In fact, none of the above materials have quantum spin Hall effect since the spin is not conserved due to the spin-orbital interaction that makes those materials non trivial.)
