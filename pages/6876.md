## Summary

Just as geometry is encoded in the metric tensor and manifests itself via the [[Hodge star operator]], so too do the [[electromagnetic constitutive equations]]. For example, in linear media we have the simple constitutive relations

$$
  E = \frac{1}{\epsilon} D \quad\text{and}\quad B = \mu H.
$$

between the electric field $E$ and the magnetic field $B$.

In 4d, we have

$$
  F = B + E\wedge d t
$$

The 4d constitutive relation is 

$$
  G = \star F
  \,,
$$

which under assumptions of linearity gives

$$
  \star F = -\eta(D-H\wedge d t)
  \,,
$$

where $\eta = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{\epsilon}}$. This may be written in a form that more closely mimics the tradition relations via

$$
  \star(v d t\wedge E) = \frac{1}{\epsilon} D\quad\text{and}\quad\star B = \mu H\wedge v d t
  \,,
$$

where $v = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu\epsilon}}$ (Note: $v = c$ in vacuum). 

What this means is the the electromagnetic properties of matter can be interpreted geometrically and are encoded in the 
[[Hodge star operator]]. Conversely, it means that geometrical properties of matter can be interpreted electromagnetically.
