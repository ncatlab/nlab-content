# Equicontinuous functions

## Idea

A [[function]] $f$ is [[continuous map|continuous]] if, roughly speaking, $f(x)$ is arbitrarily close to $f(y)$ whenever $x$ is sufficiently close to $y$.  However, 'close' is relative, and $f(x)$ may be much closer to $f(y)$ than $g(x)$ is to $g(y)$, even if both $f$ and $g$ are continuous.  Nevertheless, given a [[family]] of functions, we may have that $f(x)$ is arbitrarily close to $f(y)$ for *every* function $f$ in the family at once whenever $x$ is sufficiently close to $y$.  In this case, the family of functions is _equicontinuous_.


## Definitions

Because we are considering the relative degree of closeness between potentially unrelated pairs of points, we need a [[uniform structure]] to define this concept.  So let $X$ and $Y$ be [[uniform spaces]] (although the concept should make sense in somewhat greater generality), and let $\mathcal{F}$ be a [[family]] of [[functions]] from $X$ to $Y$.

+-- {: .num_defn #Continuous}
###### Definition

The family $\mathcal{F}$ is __continuous__ if each member is [[continuous function|continuous]]:  For each [[entourage]] $E$ in $Y$, for each function $f$ in $\mathcal{F}$ and each [[point]] $x \in X$, for some entourage $D$ in $X$, for each point $y$ in $X$, whenever $x \approx_D y$, we have $f(x) \approx_E f(y)$.
=--

In short:
$$ \forall E,\; \forall f,\; \forall x,\; \exists D,\; \forall y,\; x \approx_D y \;\Rightarrow\; f(x) \approx_E f(y) .$$

+-- {: .num_defn #UniformlyContinuous}
###### Definition

The family $\mathcal{F}$ is __uniformly continuous__ if each member is [[uniformly continuous function|uniformly continuous]]:  For each [[entourage]] $E$ in $Y$, for each function $f$ in $\mathcal{F}$, for some entourage $D$ in $X$, for each [[point]] $x$ in $X$, for each point $y$ in $X$, whenever $x \approx_D y$, we have $f(x) \approx_E f(y)$.
=--

In short:
$$ \forall E,\; \forall f,\; \exists D,\; \forall x,\; \forall y,\; x \approx_D y \;\Rightarrow\; f(x) \approx_E f(y) .$$

+-- {: .num_defn #Equicontinuous}
###### Definition

The family $\mathcal{F}$ is __equicontinuous__ if:  For each [[entourage]] $E$ in $Y$, for each [[point]] $x$ in $X$, for some entourage $D$ in $X$, for each function $f$ in $\mathcal{F}$, for each point $y$ in $X$, whenever $x \approx_D y$, we have $f(x) \approx_E f(y)$.
=--

In short:
$$ \forall E,\; \forall x,\; \exists D,\; \forall f,\; \forall y,\; x \approx_D y \;\Rightarrow\; f(x) \approx_E f(y) .$$

+-- {: .num_defn #UniformlyEquicontinuous}
###### Definition

The family $\mathcal{F}$ is __uniformly equicontinuous__ if:  For each [[entourage]] $E$ in $Y$, for some entourage $D$ in $X$, for each function $f$ in $\mathcal{F}$ and each [[point]] $x$ in $X$, for each point $y$ in $X$, whenever $x \approx_D y$, we have $f(x) \approx_E f(y)$.
=--

In short:
$$ \forall E,\; \exists D,\; \forall f,\; \forall x,\; \forall y,\; x \approx_D y \;\Rightarrow\; f(x) \approx_E f(y) .$$

All of these definitions are identical except for the placement of the [[quantifiers]] $\forall f$ and $\forall x$ before or after the quantifier $\exists D$.

Just as it is reasonable to speak of a single function $f$ continuous at a single point $x$, so it is reasonable to speak of a family equicontinuous at a single point $x$ (or, for that matter, of a single function $f$ uniformly continuous).  However, it makes no sense to speak of a single function $f$ equicontinuous (or uniformly equicontinuous), nor can we speak of a family of functions uniformly equicontinuous at a single point $x$.


## Properties

The [[Cauchy sum theorem]] holds for an equicontinuous family of functions (from the [[real line]] to itself), *without* the requirement for [[uniform convergence]].


## Arzela-Ascoli theorem 

The importance of equicontinuity is perhaps best illustrated by the Arzel&agrave;-Ascoli theorem, which gives conditions for a set in a [[exponential law for spaces|function space]] to be compact. A reasonably general version is this: 

+-- {: .num_theorem} 
###### Theorem 
Let $X$ be a [[convergence space]] and $Y$ a [[uniform space]]. Then a subset $F \subseteq C(X, Y)$ is [[relatively compact subspace|relatively compact]] (has compact closure) iff it is equicontinuous and $\{f(x):\; f \in F\}$ is relatively compact in $Y$ for each $x \in X$.

See [BB, corollary 2.4.9](#BB). Here the topology on the space $C(X, Y)$ of continuous functions $X \to Y$ is the so-called _natural topology_, namely the largest topology on $C(X, Y)$ such that for all spaces $A$, the continuity of a map $g: A \times X \to Y$ implies the continuity of its transpose $\hat{g}: A \to C(X, Y)$. This is the same as the exponential in $Top$ whenever the exponential exists. See [Escard&oacute;, sections 8.1 and 10.2](#Es); see also [ELS](#ELS) where it is shown that the natural topology on $C(X, Y)$ coincides with the topology of continuous convergence (which is the context for the theorem above). 

(Some applications of Arzela-Ascoli should also be given.)
