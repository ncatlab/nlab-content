## Definition

Classically, we have:

+-- {: .num_defn}

A __Grothendieck topos__ $\mathcal{T}$ is a category that admits a [[geometric embedding]]

$$
  \mathcal{T} \stackrel{\stackrel{lex}{\leftarrow}}{\hookrightarrow}
  PSh(C)
$$

in a [[presheaf]] category, i.e., a full and faithful functor that has a left exact left adjoint. 

This is equivalently the [[category of sheaves]] ([[Set]]-valued [[presheaves]] satisfying the sheaf condition) over a [[small category|small]] [[site]].

=--

Since smallness can be relative, we also have:

+-- {: .num_defn}

For a given fixed [[ETCS|category of sets]] $S$, a __Grothendieck topos__ over $S$ is a [[category of sheaves]] ($S$-valued [[presheaves]] satisfying the sheaf condition) over a [[site]] which is [[small category|small]] relative to $S$, that is a site [[internal category|internal]] to $S$.
=--

Note that a Grothendieck topos is a [[topos]] because (or if) $S$ is.

The [[site]] is not considered part of the structure; different sites may give rise to [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] category of sheaves.

By the general theory of [[geometric morphisms]], every Grothendieck topos sits inside a category of [[presheaf|presheaves]] by a [[geometric embedding]] $Sh(S) \hookrightarrow PSh(S)$. 

* This may be taken as an alternative definition of [[sheaf]]: since [[Lawvere-Tierney topology|Lawvere-Tierney topologies]] are bijectively given by [[geometric embeddings]],  instead of explicitly defining a sheaf as a presheaf satisfying [[descent]], one may define categories of sheaves as geometric embeddings into presheaf categories. 

* For details on the relation between the two perspectives see [[geometric embedding]].

* This perspective is useful for defining the [[vertical categorification]] of sheaves: [[stacks]] and [[∞-stacks]]: the higher categories of these may be defined as geometric embeddings into higher categories of presheaves. This has been worked out in detail for [[(∞,1)-categories]]. See [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves]].

* Sometimes it is useful to distinguish between [[petit topos]] and [[gros topos]].


## Properties

### General

+-- {: .num_prop #LocallyPresentable}
###### Proposition

Every Grothendieck topos is a [[locally presentable category]].

=--

([Borceux 94, vol 3, prop. 3.4.16](#Borceux94))

+-- {: .num_prop #total}
###### Proposition

Every Grothendieck topos is a [[total category]] and a [[cototal category]].

=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 

From the page [[total category]], totality follows from the fact that a Grothendieck topos is 

* [[cocomplete category|Cocomplete]], 
* [[well-powered category|Well-copowered]] (because [[quotient]] objects of an [[object]] $X$ are in [[bijection]] with [[equivalence relations]] on $X$, and there is a [[small set]] of these because a Grothendieck topos is well-powered), and 
* Has a [[generator]] (e.g., the [[coproduct]] of all [[representable functor|representables]] for a [[small site]] presentation). 

Dually, a Grothendieck topos is 

* [[complete category|Complete]], 
* [[well-powered category|Well-powered]] (because [[subobjects]] of an [[object]] $X$ are in [[bijection]] with elements of a [[small set|small]] [[hom-set]] $\hom(X, \Omega)$), and 
* Has a [[cogenerator]] (e.g., the [[product]] of [[power objects]] $\Omega^c$ where $c$ ranges over representables for a small site presentation). 

Therefore a Grothendieck topos is also cototal. 

=--


### Giraud\'s axiomatic characterization
{#Giraud}

Giraud characterized Grothendieck toposes as categories satisfying certain [[exactness property|exactness]] and [[small set|small]] [[complete category|completeness]] properties (where "small" is again relative to the given category of sets $S$). The exactness properties are elementary (not depending on $S$), and are satisfied in any elementary [[topos]], or even a [[pretopos]].

[[Giraud's theorem]] characterises a Grothendieck topos as follows:

1. a [[locally small]] [[category]] with a small [[generating set]],
2. with all finite [[limits]],
3. with all small [[coproducts]], which are [[disjoint coproduct|disjoint]], and [[pullback stability|pullback-stable]],
4. where all [[congruences]] have effective [[quotient objects]], which are also pullback-stable.

These conditions are equivalent to

* a [[locally small]] [[infinitary pretopos]] with a small generating set.

See the [[Elephant]], theorem C.2.2.8.  (There, the assumption of local smallness is not stated explicitly, but it is included in the definition of $\infty$-pretopos by way of [[well-powered category|well-poweredness]]; on the nLab it is not so included, so we have to state it explicitly.  To see that it is necessary, note that if $U$ and $V$ are [[Grothendieck universes]] with $U\in V$, then $Set_V$ satisfies all the other conditions relative to $Set_U$, but is not locally small and is not a Grothendieck topos.)  See also [Wikipedia](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Topos#Giraud.27s_axioms).

Sometimes (3,4) are combined and strengthened to the statement that the category has all small [[colimits]], which are effective and pullback-stable.  However, this is a mistake for two reasons: it is a significantly stronger axiomatisation (since without the small generating set, not every infinitary pretopos has this property), and it is not valid in weak foundations (while the definition given above is).

### Street's axiomatic characterization 

Augmenting the aforementioned Proposition \ref{total} that Grothendieck toposes are total categories, [Street](#Street) more or less characterizes Grothendieck toposes as *lex total* categories having the same "size" as $Set$. 

In more detail: we take as background set theory ZFC + "there is a strongly inaccessible cardinal" $\kappa$; equivalently, the existence of a single [[Grothendieck universe]] $U$ (a set of "small sets"). Supposing given a model $V$ of $ZFC+universe$, "category" shall then refer to category theory interpreted in $V$. Let $Set$ be the category of small sets; note that the set of morphisms of $Set$ has size $\kappa$. Let $E$ be a locally small category. 

+-- {: .num_defn} 
###### Definition 
$E$ is _lex total_ if the [[Yoneda embedding]] $y: E \to [E^{op}, Set]$ has a [[left exact functor|left exact]] [[left adjoint]]. 
=-- 

+-- {: .num_theorem} 
###### Theorem 
**(Street)** 
A category $E$ is a Grothendieck topos iff it is lex total and the size of the set of isomorphism classes of objects is $\kappa$ or less. 
=-- 

+-- {: .num_remark} 
###### Remark 
This result is in the spirit of saying "every Grothendieck topos is the category of [[sheaves]] with respect to the [[canonical topology]] on itself". Putting aside set-theoretic issues, it suggests that Grothendieck toposes be seen as analogous to [[frames]], which may be defined as lex total objects in $\mathbf{2}$-$Cat$. In this setting, the appropriate morphisms are left exact left adjoints, so that Grothendieck toposes and [[geometric morphisms]] between them would be analogous to [[locales]] and [[continuous maps]] between them. 

One can deduce formally that lex total categories are [[locally cartesian closed category|locally cartesian closed]] [[Heyting pretoposes]]. 
=-- 

### As lex reflections of categories of presheaves

[[sheaf toposes are equivalently the left exact reflective subcategories of presheaf toposes]]

### As localic groupoids
 {#AsLocalicGroupoids}

Every Grothendieck topos is equivalent to the [[classifying topos of a localic groupoid]], every Grothendieck topos [[point of a topos|with enough points]] is equivalent to the classifying topos of a [[topological groupoid]], and in fact the 2-category [[Topos]] of Grothendieck toposes is equivalent to a localization of that of [[localic groupoids]].

See at _[[classifying topos of a localic groupoid]]_ for more.

## In weak foundations

We have two definitions of a Grothendieck topos:

*  the category of sheaves on some small site,
*  a category that satisfies Giraud\'s axioms (as listed above).

The theorem that these are equivalent can be proved in quite weak foundations, whether [[finitist mathematics|finitist]], [[predicative mathematics|predicative]], or [[constructive mathematics|constructive]] (or all three at once), as long as we axiomatize correctly given the caveats listed in the previous section.  Some hard-nosed predicativists (and even hard-nosed ZFC fundamentalists) may object to the language (on the ground that large categories such as $Set$ and other nontrivial Grothendieck toposes don\'t really exist), but they should accept the theorems when suitably phrased.

In predicative mathematics, however, we cannot prove that every Grothendieck topos is in fact a [[topos]]!  In fact, it is immediate that [[the category of sets]] is a Grothendieck topos, but $Set$ is an elementary topos if and only if [[power sets]] are small, which is precisely what predicativists doubt.  One can use the term __Grothendieck pretopos__ to avoid implying that we have an elementary topos.  On the other hand, since Grothendeick toposes came first, perhaps it is the definition of 'elementary topos' that is too strong.

Similarly, in finitist mathematics, we cannot prove that every Grothendieck topos has a [[natural numbers object]]; while in strongly predicative mathematics, we cannot prove that every Grothendieck topos is [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]].  In each case, once a property is accepted of $Set$ (the [[axiom of infinity]] and small [[function sets]], in these examples), it can be proved for all Grothendieck toposes.

Constructivism as such is irrelevant; even in [[classical mathematics]], most Grothendieck toposes are not [[boolean topos|boolean]].  However, for an analogous result, try the theorem that the [[category of presheaves]] on a [[groupoid]] (and hence any category of sheaves contained within it) is boolean.  (Again, $Set$ itself is an example of this.)

The theorem that every Grothendieck topos is [[cocomplete category|cocomplete]] is a subtle point; it fails only in finitist predicative mathematics.  (The key point in the proof is to generate the [[transitive relation|transitive closure]] $\sim^*$ of a binary relation $\sim$.  One proof defines $a \sim^* b$ to mean that $a \sim x_0 \sim \cdots \sim x_{n-1} \sim b$ for some $n$, which is predicative but infinitary; another defines $a \sim^* b$ to mean that $a \sim' b$ for every transitive relation $\sim'$ that contains $\sim$, which is finitary but impredicative.)
