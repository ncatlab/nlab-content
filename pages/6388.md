## Idea

What are called _Einstein's equations_ are the [[equations of motion]] of gravity: the [[Euler-Lagrange equations]] induced by the [[Einstein-Hilbert action]].

They say that the [[Einstein tensor]] $G$ of the [[metric]]/the [[field (physics)|field]] of [[gravity]] [[equality|equals]] the [[energy-momentum tensor]] $T$ of the remaing [[force]]- and [[matter]]-[[field (physics)|fields]]:

$$
  G = T
  \,.
$$
