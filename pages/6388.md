## Idea

What are called _Einstein's equations_ are the [[equations of motion]] of gravity: the [[Euler-Lagrange equations]] induced by the [[Einstein-Hilbert action]].

## References

A discussion of the vacuum Einstein equations (only gravity, no other fields) in terms of [[synthetic differential geometry]] is in
