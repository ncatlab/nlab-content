A construction generalizing deformed preprojective algebra of quivers and assigning to a $K$-algebra $A$ with an element $\lambda\in K\otimes_{\mathbf{Z}}K_0(A)$ a new algebra $\pi^\lambda(A)$ and a canonical homomorphism $A\to \pi^\lambda(A)$ is described in

Some examples of this construction are the algebra of differential operators on a smooth curve in characteristic zero
and the cotangent bundle of $Spec(A)$. Conze's original construction is for an embedding of a [[Weyl algebra]]. Modules over deformed preprojective algebras are in some case closely related to $A_\infty$-modules over Weyl algebra.
