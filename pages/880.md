A (binary) [[relation]] $\sim$ on a set $A$ is __asymmetric__ if no two elements are related in both orders:
$$\forall (x, y: A),\; x \sim y \;\Rightarrow\; y \nsim x$$

In the language of the $2$-poset-with-duals [[Rel]] of sets and relations, a relation $R: A \to A$ is __asymmetric__ if it is disjoint from its dual:
$$R \cap R^{op} \subseteq \empty$$
Of course, this containment is in fact an equality.

An asymmetric relation is necessarily [[irreflexive relation|irreflexive]].
