## Definition

A **Boolean topos** is a [[topos]] that is also a [[Boolean category]].

There are several conditions on a topos that are necessary and sufficient to be boolean:
* Every [[subobject]] has a complement (the general definition of boolean category).
* Every [[subobject poset|subobject lattice]] is a [[Boolean algebra]].
* The [[subobject classifier]] $\Omega$ is an [[internalization|internal]] Boolean algebra.
* The maps $\top, \bot: 1 \to \Omega$ are a [[coproduct]] cone (so in particular, $\Omega \cong 1 + 1$, but this alone is not sufficient).


## As a context for foundations

The [[internal logic]] of a boolean topos with [[natural numbers object]] can serve as [[foundations]] for "ordinary" mathematics, except for that which relies on the [[axiom of choice]].  If you add the axiom of choice, then you get (an internal version of) [[ETCS]]; conversely, if you use an arbitrary topos, then you get [[constructive mathematics]].  (For some high-powered work, you may also need to add a version of the [[axiom of replacement]] or an axiom of [[Grothendieck universe]]s.)

Every [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]] boolean [[pretopos]] is in fact a topos.  This is why 'generalised [[predicative mathematics|predicativism]]' (with function types but not power types) is necessarily a feature of [[constructive mathematics]] only.


## Examples

With [[excluded middle]] in the meta-logic, every [[well-pointed topos]] is a Boolean topos. This includes [[Set]] and models of [[ETCS]]. 

The topos of [[canonical topology|canonical]] sheaves on a [[Boolean algebra]] is Boolean. 

If $E$ is any topos, the category of [[sheaf|sheaves]] for the [[double negation|double-negation topology]] is a Boolean [[subtopos]] of $E$. 

Any topos satisfying the [[axiom of choice]] is Boolean. This result is due to R. Diaconescu; see [[excluded middle]] for a brief discussion. 

[[Barr's theorem]] implies that any topos $E$ can be covered by a Boolean topos $F$, in the sense of there being a [[surjective geometric morphism]] $f \colon F \to E$.
