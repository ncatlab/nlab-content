## Idea

A natural [[tensor product]] of [[chain complexes]] that makes the [[category of chain complexes]] into a [[closed monoidal category]].

## Definition

Let $R$ be a [[commutative ring]] and $\mathcal{A} = R$[[Mod]] the [[category]] of [[modules]] over $R$. Write $Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A})$ for the [[category of chain complexes]] of $R$-modules.

###### Definition

For $X, Y \in Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A})$ write  $X \otimes Y \in Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A})$ for the chain complex whose component in degree $n$ is given by the [[direct sum]]

$$
  (X \otimes Y)_n := \oplus_{i + j = n} X_i \otimes_R Y_j
$$

over all tensor products of components whose degrees sum to $n$,
and whose [[differential]] is given on elements $(x,y)$ of homogeneous degree by

$$
  d (x, y) = (d_X x, y) + (-1)^{deg(y)} (x, d_Y y)
  \,.
$$
