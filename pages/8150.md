## Idea

A natural [[tensor product]] of [[chain complexes]] that makes the [[category of chain complexes]] into a [[closed monoidal category]].

## Definition

Let $R$ be a [[commutative ring]] and $\mathcal{A} = R$[[Mod]] the [[category]] of [[modules]] over $R$. Write $Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A})$ for the [[category of chain complexes]] of $R$-modules. 


+-- {: .num_defn #TheTensorProdComplex}
###### Definition

For $X, Y \in Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A})$ write  $X \otimes Y \in Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A})$ for the chain complex whose component in degree $n$ is given by the [[direct sum]]

$$
  (X \otimes Y)_n := \oplus_{i + j = n} X_i \otimes_R Y_j
$$

over all tensor products of components whose degrees sum to $n$,
and whose [[differential]] is given on elements $(x,y)$ of homogeneous degree by

$$
  \partial^{X \otimes Y} (x, y) = (\partial^X x, y) + 
  (-1)^{deg(y)} (x, \partial^Y y)
  \,.

###### Example


For $R$ some [[ring]], let $I_\bullet \in Ch_\bullet(R Mod)$ be the chain complex given by

$$
  I_\bullet =
  \left[
     \cdots \to 0 \to 0 \to R \stackrel{\partial^{I}_0}{\to} R \oplus R
  \right]
  \,,
$$

where $\partial^I_0 = (-id, id)$. 

This is the [[normalized chain complex]] of the [[chain on a simplicial set|simplicial chain complex]] of the standard simplicial interval, the 1-[[simplex]] $\Delta_1$, as follows: we may think of 

$$
 I_0 = R \oplus R \simeq R[ \{(0), (1)\} ]
$$

as the $R$-[[linear span]] of two [[basis]] elements labelled "$(0)$" and "$(1)$", to be thought of as the two 0-[[chain on a simplicial set|chains]] on the endpoints of the interval. Similarly we may think of

$$
  I_1 = R \simeq R[\{(0 \to 1)\}]
$$

as the free $R$-module on the single basis element which is the unique non-degenerate 1-[[simplex]] $(0 \to 1)$ in $\Delta^1$.

Accordingly, the [[differential]] $\partial^I_0$ is the oriented [[boundary]] map of the interval, taking this basis element to

$$
  \partial^I_0 : (0 \to 1) \mapsto (1) - (0) 
$$

and hence a general element $r\cdot(0 \to 1)$ for some $r \in R$ to 

$$
  \partial^I_0 : r\cdot(0 \to 1) \mapsto r\cdot (1) - r\cdot(0) 
  \,.
$$

We now write out in full details the tensor product of chain complexes of $I_\bullet$ with itself, according to def. \ref{TheTensorProdComplex}:

$$
  S_\bullet \coloneqq I_\bullet \otimes I_\bullet
  \,.
$$

By definition and using the above choice of [[basis]] element, this is in low degree given as follows:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    S_0 
    &=  
    I_0 \oplus I_0 
    \\
    & =
    (R \oplus R) \otimes (R \oplus R)
    \\
    & \simeq R \oplus R \oplus R \oplus R
    \\
    & = 
    \left\{
       r_{00} \cdot ((0),(0)')
       +
       r_{01} \cdot ((0),(1)')
       +
       r_{10} \cdot ((1),(0)')
       +
       r_{11} \cdot ((1),(1)')
       |
       r_{\cdot, \cdot} \in R
    \right\}
  \end{aligned}
  \,,
$$

where in the last line we express a general element as a linear combination of the canonical basis elements which are obtained as tensor products $(a,b) \in R\otimes R$ of the previous basis elements. Notice that by the definition of [[tensor product of modules]] we have relations like

$$
  r ( (0), (1)') = (r(0), (1)') = ((0), r(1)')
$$

etc. 

Similarly then, in degree-1 the tensor product chain complex is

$$
  \begin{aligned}
     (I \otimes I)_1 
     & =
     (I_0 \otimes I_1) \oplus (I_1 \otimes I_0)
     \\
     & \simeq
     R \otimes (R \oplus R) \oplus (R \oplus R) \otimes R
     \\
     & \simeq
     R \oplus R \oplus R \oplus R
     \\
     & \simeq
     \left\{
       r_{0} \cdot ((0),(0\to 1)')
       + 
       r_{1} \cdot ((1), (0 \to 1)')
       + 
       \bar r_0 \cdot ((0\to 1), (0)')
       +
       \bar r_1 \cdot ((0 \to 1), (1)')
       |
       r_{\cdot}, \bar r_{\cdot} \in R
     \right\}
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

And finally in degree 2 it is 

$$
  \begin{aligned}
     (I \otimes I)_2
     & \simeq
     I_1 \otimes I_1
     \\
     & \simeq
     R \otimes R
     \\
     & \simeq R
     \\
     & \simeq
     \left\{
       r\cdot ((0 \to 1), (0 \to 1)')
       |
       r \in R
     \right\}
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

All other contributions that are potentiall present in $(I \otimes I)_\bullet$ vanish (are the [[trivial group|0-module]]) because all higher terms in $I_\bullet$ are.

The tensor product basis elements appearing in the above expressions have a clear [[geometry|geometric]] interpretation: we can label a square with them as follows

$$
  \array{
     ((0),(1)')
     &&\underset{((0\to 1),(0))}{\to}&&
     ((1),(1)')
     \\
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{((0),(0\to 1)')}}\uparrow 
     &&\righttoleftarrow^{((0 \to 1), (0\to 1)')}&& 
     \uparrow^{\mathrlap{((1),(0 \to 1)')}}
     \\
     \\
     ((0),(0)')
     &&\underset{((0\to 1),(0)')}{\to}&&
     ((1),(0)')
  }
  \,.
$$

This diagram indicates a [[cellular complex|cellular]] square and identifies its canonical [[singular chains]] with the elements of $(I \otimes I)_\bullet$. The arrows indicate the orientation. For instance the fact that

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \partial^{I \otimes I} ((0 \to 1), (0)')
    & =
    (\partial^I (0 \to 1), (0)')
    + (-1)^1
    ((0\to 1), \partial^I (0))
    \\
    & = 
    ( (1) - (0), \;(0)' )
    - 0
    \\
    & = 
    ((1), (0)') - ((0), (0)')
  \end{aligned} 
$$

says that the oriented [[boundary]] of the bottom morphism is the bottom right element (its target) minus the bottom left element (its source), as indicated. Here we used that the differential of a degree-0 element in $I_\bullet$ is 0, and hence so is any tensor product with it.

Similarly the oriented boundary of the square itself is computed to

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \partial^{I \otimes I} ((0 \to 1), (0 \to 1)')
    &=
    (\partial^I (0 \to 1), (0 \to 1)')
    - 
    ((0 \to 1), \partial^I(0 \to 1))
    \\
    & = 
    ((1)- (0), (0 \to 1)')
    -
    ((0 \to 1), (1)' - (0)')
    \\
    & = 
    ((1), (0 \to 1)')
    -
    ((0), (0 \to 1)')
    -
    ((0 \to 1), (1)')
    +
    ((0 \to 1), (0)')
  \end{aligned}
  \,,
$$

which can be read as saying that the boundary is the evident boundary thought of as oriented by drawing it _counterclockwise_ into the plane, so that the right arrow (which points up) contributes with a +1 prefactor, while the left arrow (which also points up) contributes with a -1 prefactor.
