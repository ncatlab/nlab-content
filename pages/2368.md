## Idea

A _symmetric smash product of spectra_ is a realization of the [[smash product of spectra]] such as to make a [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]] [[monoidal model category]] [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presentation]] of the [[symmetric monoidal (infinity,1)-category of spectra]]. 

In [[higher algebra]] and [[stable homotopy theory]] one is interested in [[monoid in a monoidal (∞,1)-category|monoid objects]] in the [[stable (∞,1)-category of spectra]] -- called $A_\infty$-[[A-∞-ring|rings]] -- and [[commutative monoid in an (infinity,1)-category|commutative monoid objects]] -- called $E_\infty$-[[E-∞-ring|rings]]. These monoid objects satisfy associativity, uniticity and, in the $E_\infty$-case, commutativity up to [[coherence|coherent]] [[higher homotopies]]. 

For concretely working with these objects, it is often useful to have concrete  [[category theory|1-categorical]] algebraic models for these intricate [[higher category theory|higher categorical]]/homotopical entities. The _symmetric monoidal smash product of spectra_ is a structure that allows to model [[A-infinity rings]] as ordinary [[monoids]] and [[E-infinity rings]] as ordinary [[commutative monoids]] in a suitable ordinary [[category]] -- one speaks of _[[highly structured ring spectra]]_.

Historically, this had been desired but out of reach for a long time, due to the initial focus on the model by plain [[sequential spectra]]. By [this remark](smash+product+of+spectra#WhySequentialSpectraHaveNoSymmetricSmashProduct) at _[[smash product of spectra]]_, plain sequential spectra  do not reflect the graded-commutativity implicit in the [[braiding]] of the [[smash product]] of [[n-spheres]] and thus do not admit a symmetric smash product of spectra.

When the relevant [[highly structured ring spectra]] were finally found that do admit symmetric smash products, the relief was substantial and led to terminology such as "[[brave new algebra]]". More recently maybe the term [[higher algebra]] is becoming more popular.

Then, model structures were found which also admit symmetric monoidal smash products, but which are not of the form "highly structured spectra": [[model structure for excisive functors]].


As a first step one wants a [[model category of spectra]] $\mathcal{S}$ that [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presents]] the full [[(infinity,1)-category of spectra]]. This allows to model the notion of [[equivalence]] of spectra and of [[homotopies]] between maps of spectra.  Several such model categories 
have been known for a long time; all are Quillen equivalent and their common [[homotopy category]] is called "the" [[stable homotopy category]] $Ho \mathcal{S}$.


Now, for some of the model categories $\mathcal{S}$ of spectra, the smash product on $Ho \mathcal{S}$ can be lifted to a functor
$$
  \wedge\colon \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{S} \to \mathcal{S}
  \,,
$$
but for the most part these functors were neither associative nor unital nor commutative at the level of the 1-category $\mathcal{S}$.  In fact ([Lewis 91](#Lewis91)) proved a theorem that there could be *no* symmetric monoidal category $\mathcal{S}$ modeling the stable homotopy category and satisfying a couple of other natural requirements.

However, in the 1990s it was realized that by dropping one or another of Lewis' other requirements, symmetric monoidal categories of spectra could be produced.  The first such category was the category of **[[S-module]]s** described by [Elmendorf-Kriz-Mandell-May 97](#ElmendorfKrizMandellMay97), but others soon followed, including **[[symmetric spectra]]** and **[[orthogonal spectra]]**.  All of these form symmetric [[monoidal model categories]] which are symmetric-monoidally [[Quillen equivalence|Quillen equivalent]].

Moreover, in all of these cases, the monoidal structure on the model category $\mathcal{S}$ absorbs all the higher coherent homotopies that used to be supplied by the action of an $A_\infty$ or $E_\infty$ operad.  Thus, honest (commutative) monoids in $\mathcal{S}$ model the same "(commutative) ring objects up to all coherent higher homotopies" that are modeled by the classical $A_\infty$ and $E_\infty$ ring spectra, and for this reason they are often still referred to as $A_\infty$ or $E_\infty$ ring spectra, respectively.

## Details

### For $S$-modules

The construction of [[S-modules]] by EKMM begins with the notion of [[coordinate-free spectrum|coordinate free Lewis-May spectra]].  Using the [[linear isometries operad]], one can construct a [[monad]] $\mathbb{L}$ on the category $\mathcal{S}$ of such spectra, and the category of $\mathbb{L}$-algebras is a well-behaved model for the stable homotopy category, and moreover admits a smash product which is associative up to isomorphism, but unital only up to weak equivalence.  However, the subcategory of the $\mathbb{L}$-algebras for which the unit transformations are isomorphisms is again a well-behaved model for $Ho \mathbb{S}$, which is moreover symmetric monoidal.

Since the unit transformation is of the form $S\wedge E \to E$, where $S$ is the [[sphere spectrum]], and this map looks like the action of a ring on a module, the objects of this subcategory are called **$S$-modules** and the category is called $Mod_S$.  The intuition is that just as an abelian group is a [[module]] over the archetypical ring $\mathbb{Z}$ of [[integer|integers]], a spectrum should be regarded as a module over the archetypal ring spectrum, namely the sphere spectrum.

Similarly, just as an ordinary [[ring]] is a [[monoid]] in the category $Mod_\mathbb{Z}$ of $\mathbb{Z}$-[[module]]s, i.e. a $\mathbb{Z}$-algebra, an $A_\infty$ or $E_\infty$ ring spectrum is a (possibly commutative) monoid in the category of $S$-modules, and thus referred to as an **$S$-algebra**.  More generally, for any $A_\infty$-[[A-infinity-ring|ring spectrum]] $R$, there is a notion of $R$-[[module]] spectra forming a category $Mod_R$, which in turn carries an associative and commutative smash product $\wedge_R$ and a [[model category]] structure on $Mod_R$ such that $\wedge_R$ becomes unital in the [[homotopy category]].  All this is such that an $A_\infty$-[[A-infinity-algebra|algebra]] over $R$ is a [[monoid object]] in $(Mod_R, \wedge_R)$.  Similarly $E_\infty$-[[E-infinity-algebra|algebras]] are commutative monoid objects in $(Mod_R, \wedge_R)$.

### For excisive functors


##### Topological ends and coends
 {#TopologicalEndsAndCoends}

For working with pointed [[topologically enriched functors]], a certain shape of [[limits]]/[[colimits]] is particularly relevant: these are called (pointed topological enriched) _[[ends]]_ and _[[coends]]_. We here introduce these and then derive some of their basic properties, such as notably the expression for topological [[left Kan extension]] in terms of [[coends]] (prop. \ref{TopologicalLeftKanExtensionBCoend} below). Further below it is via left Kan extension along the ordinary smash product of pointed topological spaces ("[[Day convolution]]") that the [[symmetric monoidal smash product of spectra]] is induced.

1. The **pointed topologically enriched [[opposite category]]** $\mathcal{C}^{op}$ is the [[topologically enriched category]] with the same [[objects]] as $\mathcal{C}$, with [[hom-spaces]]

   $$
     \mathcal{C}^{op}(X,Y)

   and whose [[composition]] operation is the [[braiding]] followed by the [[smash product]] of the separate composition operations:

   $$

By functoriallity and under passing to [[adjuncts]] ([cor.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#SmashHomAdjunctionOnPointedCompactlyGeneratedTopologicalSpaces)) this is equivalent to two commuting _[[actions]]_


$$

  \mathcal{D}(d_1,d_2) \wedge F_0((c,d_1))

  F_0((c,d_2))
  \,.
$$

In the special case of a functor out of the [[product category]] of some $\mathcal{C}$ with its [[opposite category]] (def. \ref{OppositeAndProductOfPointedTopologicallyEnrichedCategory})

$$
  F

then this takes the form

The underlying pointed set functor $U\colon Top^{\ast/}_{cg}\to Set^{\ast/}$ [[preserved limit|preserves]] all [[limits]] ([prop.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#DescriptionOfLimitsAndColimitsInTop), [prop.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#LimitsAndColimitsOfPointedObjects), [prop.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#kTopIsCoreflectiveSubcategory)). Therefore there is an [[equalizer]] diagram in $Set^{\ast/}$ of the form

$$
  U
  \left(

$$

Here the object in the middle is just the set of collections of component morphisms $\left\{ F(c)\overset{\eta_c}{\to} G(c)\right\}_{c\in \mathcal{C}}$. The two parallel maps in the equalizer diagram take such a collection to the functions which send any $c \overset{f}{\to} d$ to the result of precomposing

$$
  \array{
    F(c)
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f(f)}}\downarrow

and of postcomposing

$$

    F(c) &\overset{\eta_c}{\longrightarrow}& G(c)

$$

each component in such a collection, respectively. These two functions being equal, hence the collection $\{\eta_c\}_{c\in \mathcal{C}}$ being in the equalizer, means precisley that for all $c,d$ and all $f\colon c \to d$ the square

$$
  \array{
    F(c) &\overset{\eta_c}{\longrightarrow}& G(c)

    \\
    F(d) &\underset{\eta_d}{\longrightarrow}& G(g)
  }
$$

is a [[commuting square]]. This is precisley the condition that the collection $\{\eta_c\}_{c\in \mathcal{C}}$ be a [[natural transformation]].

Conversely, example \ref{NaturalTransformationsViaEnds} says that [[ends]] over [[bifunctors]] of the form $Maps(F(-),G(-)))_\ast$ constitute [[hom-spaces]] between pointed [[topologically enriched functors]]:

by observing that these equalize the two actions in the definition of the [[end]].

The resulting pointed [[topologically enriched category]] $[\mathcal{C},Top^{\ast/}_{cg}]$ is also called the **$Top^{\ast/}_{cg}$-[[enriched functor category]]** over $\mathcal{C}$ with coefficients in $Top^{\ast/}_{cg}$.

**(topologically [[enriched Yoneda lemma]])**

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[small category|small]] pointed [[topologically enriched categories]] ([def.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#TopEnrichedCategory)). For $F \colon \mathcal{C}\to Top^{\ast/}_{cg}$ a pointed [[topologically enriched functor]] ([def.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#TopologicallyEnrichedFunctor)) and for $c\in \mathcal{C}$ an object, there is a [[natural isomorphism]]

between the [[hom-space]] of the pointed topological functor category, according to def. \ref{PointedTopologicalFunctorCategory}, from the [[representable functor|functor represented]] by $c$ to $F$, and the value of $F$ on $c$.

In terms of the [[ends]] (def. \ref{EndAndCoendInTopcgSmash}) defining these [[hom-spaces]], this means that

$$
  \underset{d\in \mathcal{C}}{\int} Maps(\mathcal{C}(c,d), F(d))_\ast
    \;\simeq\;
  F(c)
  \,.
$$

In this form the statement is also known as **[[Yoneda reduction]]**.

=--

The **proof** of prop. \ref{YonedaReductionTopological} is essentially dual to the proof of the next prop. \ref{TopologicalCoYonedaLemma}.

Now that [[natural transformations]] are phrased in terms of [[ends]] (example \ref{NaturalTransformationsViaEnds}), as is the Yoneda lemma (prop. \ref{YonedaReductionTopological}), it is natural to consider the [[formal duality|dual]] statement involvng [[coends]]:

For $F \colon \mathcal{C}\to Top^{\ast/}_{cg}$ a pointed [[topologically enriched functor]] ([def.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#TopologicallyEnrichedFunctor)) and for $c\in \mathcal{C}$ an object, there is a [[natural isomorphism]]

$$
  F(-)

  \overset{c \in \mathcal{C}}{\int}

$$

Moreover, the morphism that hence exhibits $F(c)$ as the [[coequalizer]] of the two morphisms in def. \ref{EndAndCoendInTopcgSmash} is componentwise the canonical action 

$$
  \mathcal{C}(d,c) \wedge F(c)

$$

which is [[adjunct]] to the component map $\mathcal{C}(d,c) \to Maps(F(c),F(d))_{\ast}$ of the [[topologically enriched functor]] $F$.

The coequalizer of pointed topological spaces that we need to consider has underlying it a coequalizer of underlying pointed sets  ([prop.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#DescriptionOfLimitsAndColimitsInTop), [prop.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#LimitsAndColimitsOfPointedObjects), [prop.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#kTopIsCoreflectiveSubcategory)). That in turn is the colimit over the diagram of underlying sets with the basepointe adjoined to the diagram ([prop.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#LimitsAndColimitsOfPointedObjects)). For a coequalizer diagram adding that extra point to the diagram clearly does not change the colimit, and so we need to consider the plain coequalizer of sets.

That is just the set of [[equivalence classes]] of [[pairs]]

$$
  ( c \overset{}{\to} c_0,\; x \in F(c) )
  \,,
$$

where two such pairs

$$
  ( c \overset{f}{\to} c_0,\; x \in F(c) )
  \,,\;\;\;\;
  ( d \overset{g}{\to} c_0,\; y \in F(d) )  
$$

are regarded as equivalent if there exists

$$
  c \overset{\phi}{\to} d
$$

such that 

$$
  f = g \circ \phi
  \,,
  \;\;\;\;\;and\;\;\;\;\;
  y = \phi(x)
  \,.
$$

(Because then the two pairs are the two images of the pair $(g,x)$ under the two morphisms being coequalized.)

But now considering the case that $d = c_0$ and $d = id_{c_0}$, so that $f = \phi$ shows that any pair

$$
  ( c \overset{\phi}{\to} c_0, \; x \in F(c))
$$

is identified, in the coequalizer, with the pair

$$
  (id_{c_0},\; \phi(x) \in F(c_0))
  \,,
$$ 

hence with $\phi(x)\in F(c_0)$. 

This shows the claim at the level of the underlying sets. To conclude it is now sufficient ([prop.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#DescriptionOfLimitsAndColimitsInTop)) to show that the topology on $F(c_0) \in Top^{\ast/}_{cg}$ is the [[final topology]] ([def.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#InitialAndFinalTopologies)) of the system of component morphisms

$$
  \mathcal{C}(d,c) \wedge F(c)
    \longrightarrow
  \underset{c}{\int} \mathcal{C}(c,c_0) \wedge F(c)
$$

which we just found. But that system includes 

$$
  \mathcal{C}(c,c) \wedge F(c) \longrightarrow F(c)
$$

which is a [[retraction]]

$$
  id \;\colon\; F(c) \longrightarrow \mathcal{C}(c,c) \wedge F(c)
  \longrightarrow F(c)
$$

and so if all the preimages of a given subset of the coequalizer under these component maps is open, it must have already been open in $F(c)$.

###### Remark

The statement of the [[co-Yoneda lemma]] in prop. \ref{TopologicalCoYonedaLemma} is a kind of [[categorification]] of the following statement in [[analysis]] (whence the notation with the integral signs):

For $X$ a [[topological space]], $f \colon X \to\mathbb{R}$ a [[continuous function]] and $\delta(-,x_0)$ denoting the [[Dirac distribution]], then

$$
  \int_{x \in X} \delta(x,x_0) f(x)

###### Proposition

For $\mathcal{C}$ a [[small category|small]] pointed [[topologically enriched category|topological]] [[monoidal category]] (def. \ref{MonoidalCategory}), the [[Day convolution]] tensor product $\otimes_{Day}$ of def. \ref{TopologicalDayConvolutionProduct} makes the pointed topologically [[enriched functor category]]

$$
  ( [\mathcal{C}, Top^{\ast/}_{cg}], \otimes_{Day}, y(1))
$$

a pointed topological [[monoidal category]] (def. \ref{MonoidalCategory}) with [[tensor unit]] $y(1)$ [[representable functor|co-represented]] by the tensor unit $1$ of $\mathcal{C}$.

Regarding [[associativity]], observe that

$$

where we used the [[Fubini theorem]] for [[coends]] (prop. \ref{CoendsCommuteWithEachOther}) and then twice the [[co-Yoneda lemma]] (prop. \ref{TopologicalCoYonedaLemma}). An analogous formula follows for $X \otimes_{Day}  (Y \otimes_{Day} Z)))(c)$, and so associativity follows via prop. \ref{DayConvolutionViaKanExtensionOfExternalTensorAlongTensor} from the associativity of the [[smash product]] and of the tensor product $\otimes_{\mathcal{C}}$.

To see that $y(1)$ is the tensor unit for $\otimes_{Day}$, 
use the [[Fubini theorem]] for [[coends]] (prop. \ref{CoendsCommuteWithEachOther}) and then twice the [[co-Yoneda lemma]] (prop. \ref{TopologicalCoYonedaLemma}) to get for any $X \in [\mathcal{C},Top^{\ast/}_{cg}]$ that

###### Proposition

For $\mathcal{C}$ a [[small category|small]] pointed [[topologically enriched category|topological]] [[monoidal category]] (def. \ref{MonoidalCategory}) with [[tensor product]] denoted $\otimes_{\mathcal{C}} \;\colon\; \mathcal{C} \times\mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}$, the [[monoidal category]] with [[Day convolution]] $([\mathcal{C},Top^{\ast/}_{cg}], \otimes_{Day}, y(I))$ from def. \ref{DayConvolutionYieldsMonoidalCategoryStructure} is a [[closed monoidal category]] (def. \ref{ClosedMonoidalCategory}).

###### Proof

Using the [[Fubini theorem]] (def. \ref{CoendsCommuteWithEachOther}) and the [[co-Yoneda lemma]] (def. \ref{TopologicalCoYonedaLemma}), there is the following sequence of [[natural isomorphisms]]:

$$

In the situation of def. \ref{DayConvolutionYieldsMonoidalCategoryStructure}, the [[Yoneda embedding]] $c\mapsto \mathcal{C}(c,-)$  constitutes a  [[strong monoidal functor]]

###### Proof

That the [[tensor unit]] is respected is part of prop. \ref{DayConvolutionYieldsMonoidalCategoryStructure}. To see that the [[tensor product]] is respected, apply the [[co-Yoneda lemma]] (prop. \ref{TopologicalCoYonedaLemma}) twice to get the following natural isomorphism

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    (y(c_1) \otimes_{Day} y(c_2))(c)

      \mathcal{C}(c_2,d_2)

##### Pre-Excisive functors
 {#OnPreExcisiveFunctors}

Write $Top^{\ast}_{cg,fin} \hookrightarrow Top^{\ast/}_{cg}$ for the full inclusion on the topological spaces isomorphic to a [[finite CW-complex]].

Then 

$$
 [Top^{\ast/}_{cg,fin}, Top^{\ast/}_{cg}]
$$

is the category of _[[pre-excisive functors]]_. By prop. \ref{DayConvolutionYieldsMonoidalCategoryStructure} the [[smash product]] of [[pointed topological spaces|pointed]] [[compactly generated topological spaces]] induces a topological [[closed monoidal category]]

$$
  \left( 
    [Top^{\ast/}_{cg,fin}, Top^{\ast/}_{cg}]
    ,\;
    \wedge_{Day}
    , y(S^0)
  \right)
$$

with 

1. [[tensor product]] the [[Day convolution product]] $\otimes_{Day}$ from def. \ref{TopologicalDayConvolutionProduct},

   this is the _symmetric monoidal [[smash product of spectra]]_ for the model of pre-excisive functors;

1. [[internal hom]] the dual operation $[-,-]_{Day}$ from prop. \ref{DayMonoidalStructureIsClosed},

   this is the corresponding _[[mapping spectrum]]_ construction for pre-excisive functors.
