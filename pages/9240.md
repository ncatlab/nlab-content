## Idea

In a [[BV-complex]] the dual of an element under the [[antibracket]] is called its  _antifield_.

(There is _no_ relation to [[antiparticle]].)

## Example

In the standard example of the [[BV-complex]] of [[multivector fields]] over a [[smooth manifold]] with [[volume form]], the antifields of the functions on the manifolds are the [[vector fields]].
