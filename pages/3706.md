## Idea

A _Lagrangian submanifold_ of a [[symplectic manifold]] is a submanifold which is a maximal [[isotropic submanifold]], hence a [[submanifold]] on which the [[symplectic form]] vanishes, and which is maximal with this property.


In the archetypical example of an even dimensional [[Cartesian space]] $X = \mathbb{R}^{2n}$ equipped with its canonical symplectic form  $\omega = \sum_{i = 1}^n d q_i \wedge d p^i$, standard Lagrangian submanifolds are the submanifolds $\mathbb{R}^n \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^{2n}$ of fixed values of the $\{q_i\}_{i = 1}^n$ [[coorsinates]]. Indeed _locally_, every Lagrangian submanifold looks like this. 

Lagrangian submanifolds are of central importance in [[symplectic geometry]] where they constitute [[leaves]] of [[real polarizations]] and are closely related to [[quantum states]]: 

If one thinks of a [[symplectic manifold]] as a [[phase space]] of a [[physical system]], then a Lagrangian submanifold may be thought of (locally) as the space of "all [[canonical momenta]] (= parameterization of a [[leaf]]) at fixed [[canonical coordinate]] (= parameterization of [[leaf space]])". 

A Lagrangian submanifold equipped with a [[half-density]] is a model for a [[state]] of the physical system in [[semiclassical approximation]] (see e.g. [Bates-Weinstein, p. 14](#BatesWeinstein)). A [[quantum state]] given by a [[wave function]] (see there) is a refinement of this concept.



## Definition

###### Definition

A (**Lagrangean** or) **lagrangian submanifold** of a [[symplectic manifold]] $(X,\omega)$ is a [[submanifold]] $L \hookrightarrow X$ such that the following equivalent conditions hold

* at each point $\ell \in L the $[[tangent space]] $T_\ell L \hookrightarrow T_\ell X$ is a [[Lagrangian subspace]] (hence a simultanously [[isotropic subspace]] and [[cosisotropic subspace]]) of $T_\ell X$ equiiped with the [[symplectic form]] $\omega_x$;

* $L \hookrightarrow X$ is a maximal [[isotropic submanifold]].

###### Remark

More generally one can consider Lagrangian submanifolds of symplectic structures in [[higher geometry]], such as [[symplectic Lie n-algebroids]] equipped with their canonical [[invariant polynomials]], thought of as [[dg-manifolds]] (via their [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]]) and equipped with graded symplectic forms. Lagrangian dg-submanifolds of such symplectic dg-manifolds have been called **$\Lambda$-structures** in ([Ševera, section 4](#Severa)).

## Examples in higher differential geometry

We discuss classes of examples of Lagrangian dg-submanifolds, remark \ref{LambdaStructures}, of [[symplectic Lie n-algebroids]].

### Of a Poisson Lie algebroid
 {#OfAPoissonLieAlgebroid}

A [[Poisson Lie algebroid]] $\mathfrak{P}$ is a [[symplectic Lie n-algebroid]] for $n = 1$. Regarding its [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] as the algebra of functions on a [[dg-manifold]], that dg-manifold carries a graded [[symplectic form]] $\omega$. One can then say

###### Definition

A dg-[[Lagrangian submanifold]] of $(\mathfrak{P}, \omega)$ is a Lagrangian dg-submanifold, also called a **$\Lambda$-structure**. ([Ševera, section 4](#Severa)).

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

A [[foliation]] by such [[leaves]] is a Lagrangian _[[foliation of a Lie algebroid]]_.

###### Proposition

For $(X, \pi)$ the [[Poisson manifold]] underlying a [[Poisson Lie algebroid]] $(\mathfrak{P}, \omega)$, a dg-Lagrangian submanifold of $(\mathfrak{P}, \omega)$ corresponds to a [[coisotropic submanifold]] of $(X, \pi)$.

([Ševera, section 4](#Severa))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

As a [[vector bundle]] with bracket structure, the [[Poisson Lie algebroid]] $\mathfrak{P}$ is

$$
  \array{
    T^* X &&\stackrel{\pi}{\to}&& T X
    \\
    & \searrow && \swarrow
    \\
    && X
  }
$$

where the horizontal morphism is given by contraction/pairing with the [[Poisson tensor]].

It is sufficient to consider this locally over a [[coordinate chart]] and hence we set without essential restriction of generality 
$X = \mathbb{R}^n$ with the [[invariant polynomial]]/graded [[symplectic form]] on $CE(\mathfrak{P})$ being

$$
  \omega = \mathbf{d} x^i \wedge \mathbf{d} p_i
  \,,
$$

where the $\{q_i\}_{i = 1}^n$ are the canonical [[coordinates]] on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and where the $\{p_i\}$ are the canonical coordinates on $T^*_x \mathbb{R}^n \simeq \mathbb{R}^n$, regarded as being in degree 1.

Consider then a sub-Lie algebroid of $\mathfrak{P}$ over a [[submanifold]] $S \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$. That the corresponding subbundle 

$$
  \array{
    E &\hookrightarrow& T^* X
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    S &\hookrightarrow & X
  }
$$

over $S$ is [[Lagrangian subspace|Lagrangian]] with respect to the above $\omega$ means that $E$ consists of precisely those [[cotangent vectors]] to $X$ which vanish when evaluated on [[tangent vectors]] of $S$. Hence 

$$
  E = N^* S
$$

is the [[conormal bundle]] to $S \hookrightarrow X$. The inclusion $N^* S \hookrightarrow T^*_S X$ of vector bundles is an inclusion of [[Lie algebroids]] over $S$ precisely if the [[anchor map]] restricts to an anchor on $S$, hence that contraction with the Poisson tensor restricted to conormal vectors  of $S$ lands in tangent vectors of $S$:

$$
 \pi(N^* S) \subset T S
  \,.
$$

This is the standard definition for what it means for $S$ to be a [[coisotropic submanifold]].

###### Remark

The dg-Lagrangian submanifolds also correspond to [[branes]] in the [[Poisson sigma-model]] (see there) on $(\mathfrak{P}, \omega)$.

### Of a Courant Lie 2-algebroid
 {#OfACourantLie2Algebroid}

A [[Courant Lie algebroid]] $\mathfrak{C}$ is a [[symplectic Lie n-algebroid]] for $n = 2$. Regarding its [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] as the algebra of functions on a [[dg-manifold]], that dg-manifold carries a graded [[symplectic form]] $\omega$. One can then say

+-- {: .num_defn #ForPoissonLieAlgebroidyByLagrangianFoliation}
###### Definition

A dg-[[Lagrangian submanifold]] of $(\mathfrak{C}, \omega)$ is also called a **$\Lambda$-structure**. ([Ševera, section 4](#Severa)).

Hence we might say **real polarization** of $(\mathfrak{C}, \omega)$ is a foliation by dg-Lagrangian submanifolds.

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The dg-Lagrangian submanifolds of a Courant Lie 2-algebroid $(\mathfrak{C}, \omega)$ correspond to [[Dirac structures]] on $(\mathfrak{C}, \omega)$.
