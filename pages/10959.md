## Idea

(...)

According to [[Kant]] the four fundamental categories are

1. [[quantity]]

1. [[quality]]

1. [[relation]]

1. [[modality]]

According to [[Hegel]] there is refinement of the table, both by adding more categories (and maybe by omitting some?) and by claiming to relate them more systematically by a system of [[unity of opposites]] and of [[Aufhebung|sublation]] of these oppositions. See at _[[Science of Logic]]_ for more on this. Hegel calls the categories the _determinations of being_.

According to [[Lawvere]] the system of categories of Hegel are usefully formalized in [[categorical logic]] ("[[objective logic]]") as systems of (co-)[[reflective subcategories]] (in the sense of [[category]] in [[category theory]]) of some ambient [[topos]]. See also at _[[Science of Logic]]_ for more on this.
