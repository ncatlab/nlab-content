## Definition

The [[category]] whose objects are [[Lie algebras]] and morphisms
are homomorphisms of [[Lie algebras]].

## Properties

As a [[variety of algebras]], the category of Lie algebras
admits all small [[limits]] and [[colimits]].
The [[forgetful functor]] to the [[category of sets]]
[[creates]] all small [[limits]] and [[sifted colimits]].
