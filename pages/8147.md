## Definition

In the context of [[algebraic topology]], a [[continuous map]] $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ between two [[topological spaces]] $X,Y$, is said to be _null homotopic_ if it is [[homotopic]] to a [[constant map]] $g$. This is considered in particular in the context of [[pointed topological spaces]] with base point-preserving maps between them and for $g$ the map constant on the base point of $Y$ (which is the [[zero morphism]] in this context).

In the context of [[homological algebra]], a _null homotopy_ is a [[chain homotopy]] from (or to) the [[zero map]].

Generally in abstract [[homotopy theory]], a null homotopy in an [[(infinity,1)-category]] is a [[2-morphism]] to (or from) a [[zero morphism]]. 

This general concept subsumes the previous two cases via the [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|(infinity,1)-categories presented by]] the [[classical model structure on pointed topological spaces]]] or a [[model structure on chain complexes]], respectively.
