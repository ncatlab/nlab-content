## Idea

What has been called _Geometry of Interaction_ ([Girard 89](#Girard89)) is a kind of [[semantics]] for [[linear logic]]/[[linear type theory]] that is however different in method from the usual [[categorical semantics]] in [[monoidal categories]]. Instead of interpreting a [[proof]] of linear implication $A\multimap B$ as a [[morphism]] between [[objects]] $A$ and $B$ in a [[monoidal category]] as in [[categorical semantics]], the _Geometry of Interaction_ interprets it as an [[endomorphism]] on the object $A\multimap B$. This has been named _operational semantics_ to contrast with thr traditional _denotational semantics_.

That also the "operational semantics" of GoI has an interpretation in [[category theory]], though, namely in [[compact closed categories]] induced from [[traced monoidal categories]] was first suggested in ([Joyal-Street-Verity 96](#JoyalStreetVerity96)) and then developed in ([Haghverdi 00](#Haghverdi00), [Abramsky-Haghverdi-Scott 02](#AbramskyHaghverdiScott02), [Haghverdi-Scott 05](#HaghverdiScott05)). See ([Shirahata](#Shirahata)) for a good review.

## Properties

### Relation to superoperators and quantum operations
 {#RelationToQuantumOperations}


We discuss a relation of the GoI to [[superoperators]]/[[quantum operations]] in [[quantum physics]].


According to ([Abramsky-Haghverdi-Scott 02, remark 5.8](#AbramskyHaghverdiScott02), [Haghverdi 00b, section 6](#Haghverdi00b)) all the standard and intended interpretations of the GoI take place in those [[compact closed categories]] $Int(\mathcal{C})$ free on a [[traced monoidal category]] $\mathcal{C}$ (as discussed there). In these references therefore the notation $Int(-)$ from ([Joyal-Street-Verity 96](#JoyalStreetVerity96)) is changed to $\mathcal{G}(-)$, for "Geometry of Interaction construction" (see [Abramsky-Haghverdi-Scott 02, p. 11](#AbramskyHaghverdiScott02)).

The objects of $Int(\mathcal{C})$ are pairs $(A^+, A^-)$ of objects of $\mathcal{C}$, a morphism $(A^+ , A^-) \to (B^+ , B^-)$ in $Int(\mathcal{C})$ is given by a morphism in $\mathcal{C}$ of the form 

$$
  \array{
    A^+\otimes B^- 
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\ 
    A^- \otimes B^+
  }
$$ 

in $\mathcal{C}$, and [[composition]] of two such morphisms $(A^+ , A^-) \to (B^+ , B^-)$ and $(B^+ , B^-) \to (C^+ , C^-)$ is given by [[trace|tracing out]] $B^+$ and $B^-$ in the evident way.

We observe now that subcategories of such $Int(\mathcal{C})$ are famous in [[quantum physics]] as "categories of [[superoperators]]" or "categories of [[quantum operations]]", formalizing [[linear maps]] on spaces of [[operators]] on a [[Hilbert spaces]] that takes [[density matrices]] (hence mixed [[quantum states]]) to density matrices ("[[completely positive maps]]").

First notice that if the [[traced monoidal category]] structure on $\mathcal{C}$ happens to be that induced by a [[compact closed category]] structure, then by compact closure the morphisms $(A^+ , A^-) \to (B^+ , B^-)$ in $Int(\mathcal{C})$ above are equivalently morphisms in $\mathcal{C}$ of the form

$$
  (A^-)^\ast \otimes A^+ \longrightarrow (B^-)^\ast \otimes B^+
$$

and if moreover one concentrates on the case where $A \coloneqq A^- \simeq A^+$ etc. then these are morphisms of the form

$$
  End(A) \longrightarrow End(B)
  \,.
$$

Under this identification the somewhat curious-looking composition in $Int(\mathcal{C})$ given by tracing in $\mathcal{C}$ becomes just plain composition in $\mathcal{C}$.

Subcategories (non-full) of $Int(\mathcal{C})$ consisting of morphisms of this form in some ambient $\mathcal{C}$ have been considered in ([Selinger 05](#Selinger05)), there denoted $CMP(\mathcal{C})$, and shown to formalize the concept of [[quantum operations]] in [[quantum physics]]. For a quick review of Selinger's construction see for instance ([Coecke-Heunen 11, section 2](#CoeckeHeunen11)). Comments related to the relation between GoI and such constructions appear in ([Abramsky-Coecke 02](#AbramskyCoecke02)).

Now the $CPM(-)$ construction requires and assumes that $\mathcal{C}$ has all [[dual objects]] (which in the standard model means to restrict to [[Hilbert spaces]] of [[quantum states]] with are of [[finite]] [[dimension]]). To generalize away from this requirement a more general definition of quantum operations in $\mathcal{C}$ is given in  ([Coecke-Heunen 11, def. 1](#CoeckeHeunen11)), there denoted $CP(\mathcal{C})$. Direct inspection shows that $CP(\mathcal{C})$ is still a (non-full) subcategory of $Int(\mathcal{C})$.
