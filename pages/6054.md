## Idea

Every [[geometric morphism]] between [[toposes]] factors into a [[geometric surjection]] followed by a [[geometric embedding]]. This exhibits an [[image]] construction in the [[topos theory|topos-theoretic]] sense.

## Statement

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

There is a [[factorization system on a 2-category|factorization system]] on the [[2-category]] [[Topos]] whose left class is the 
[[surjective geometric morphism]]s and whose right class is the [[geometric embeddings]].  

The factorization of a given geometric morphism $f$ can be given by constructing the [[Eilenberg-Moore category]] of the [[comonad]] $f^* f_*$.

This appears for instance as ([MacLaneMoerdijk, VII 4., theorem 6](#MacLaneMoerdijk)).
