# The essential image of a functor
* table of contents
{: toc}

## Idea

The notion of _essential image_ is supposed to be an adaptation of the notion of [[image]] from a [[category theory|1-categorical]] to the 
[[2-category|2-categorical]] context [[Cat]], i.e. to the image of [[functor]]s. But some care has to be exercised.

For another definition of image of a functor, see [(2,1)-image](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/image#InfImageExamples).



## Definitions

(A concrete realization of) the __essential image__ of a [[functor]] $F: A\to B$ between [[category|categories]] or $n$-[[n-category|categories]] is the smallest [[replete subcategory]] of the target $n$-category $B$ containing the __image__ of $F$.  (The *image* is, in turn, the smallest [[subcategory]] which contains all the $n$-cells which are strictly the images of $n$-cells in $A$.)

Note that if $F$ is not [[pseudomonic functor|pseudomonic]], then its essential image, defined in this way, need not be equivalent to its ordinary image.

## Considerations of evil

Note that the property of "belonging to the image" (said of an object or morphism) is [[evil]]; of two [[equivalence|equivalent]] objects, one may belong while the other does not.  Passing to the essential image removes this, so that the property of "belonging to the essential image" is no longer evil.

Of course, the property of "being equal to the essential image" (said of a subcategory) is evil, as is the property of "being replete".  But $D$ is a replete subcategory of $C$ if and only if the property of belonging to $D$ (said of an object or morphism) is not evil.

## Remarks

* the *image* may contain some morphisms or cells which are not the images of any cell in $A$, namely the [[composite|compositions]] of $B$-composable chains of such image cells, whose preimage cells do not form any $A$-composable chain;
* the *essential image* in addition contains precisely all equivalent $k$-cells to the $k$-cells of the image for all $0 \leq k \leq n$.
