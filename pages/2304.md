__Note.__  This page records the basic definitions of graph theory that have some degree of prevalence in the field that goes by that name.  Many directions of abstraction and augmentation are no doubt obvious, but it is useful to start from these.

## Graph ##

Frank Hararyâ€™s classical _Graph Theory_ defines the concept of a graph &mdash; and much of its conceptual neighborhood &mdash; in the following manner:

: A _graph_ $G$ consists of a finite nonempty set $V = V(G)$ of $p$ _points_ together with a prescribed set $X$ of $q$ unordered pairs of distinct points of $V$.  Each pair $x = \{ u, v \}$ of points in $X$ is a _line_ of $G$, and $x$ is said to _join_ $u$ and $v$.  We write $x = u v$ and say that $u$ and $v$ are _adjacent points_ (sometimes denoted $u \:\mathop{adj} v$);  point $u$ and line $x$ are _incident_ with each other, as are $v$ and $x$.  If two distinct lines $x$ and $y$ are incident with a common point, then they are _adjacent lines_.  A graph with $p$ points and $q$ lines is called a _$(p, q)$ graph_.  The (1,0) graph is _trivial_.  (Harary, 1969, p.&nbsp;9).
