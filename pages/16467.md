

[[Pierre Deligne]] proved a number of theorems. Some that go by his name are

* [[Deligne completeness theorem]]

* [[Deligne's theorem on tensor categories]]

Of course he also proved statements like the [[Weil conjectures]], on [[Tannaka duality]] and such. But this page here is to  disambiguate those statements which people ambiguously refer to as "Deligne's theorem".
