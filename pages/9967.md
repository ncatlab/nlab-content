## Definition

A [[presheaf]] is just a [[functor]] $C^{op} \to Set$ and it is a _constant presheaf_ if that functor is a [[constant functor]]. 

The [[sheafification]] of a constant presheaf is not in general constant anymore, but is called a [[locally constant sheaf]] (in fact it is also sometimes called just a [[constant sheaf]], beware).
