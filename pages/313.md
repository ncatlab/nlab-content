## Idea

In general, a diagram is the same thing as a [[functor]], and sometimes it\'s helpful to work in that generality.  However, we often use the term 'diagram' for something that we can actually see on the page, in which case we mean a functor whose domain is the [[free category]] on a [[quiver]] (often a finite one).


## Definitions

Let $C$ be a [[category]].

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition
If $J$ is also a category, then a __diagram__ in $C$ of shape $J$ is simply a [[functor]] $D\colon J \to C$.
=--

This terminology is often used when speaking about [[limits]] and [[colimits]]; that is, we speak about "the limit or colimit of a diagram."  Similarly, it is common to call the [[functor category]] $C^J$ the "category of diagrams in $C$ of shape $J$".

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition
If $J$ is a [[directed graph]], then a __diagram__ in $C$ of shape $J$ is a functor $D\colon F(J) \to C$, or equivalently a graph morphism $\bar{D}\colon J \to U(C)$.
=--

Here $F\colon Graph \to Cat$ denotes the [[free category]] on a directed graph and $U\colon Cat \to Graph$ the underlying directed graph of a category, which form a pair of [[adjoint functors]].  These are the sorts of diagrams which we "draw on a page" --- we draw a directed graph, and then label its vertices with objects of $C$ and its edges with morphisms in $C$, thereby forming a graph morphism $J\to U(C)$.

A diagram is __[[commutative diagram|commutative]]__ if it factors through a [[preorder]].  Equivalently, if $J$ is a category, then a diagram of shape $J$ commutes iff any two morphisms in $C$ that are assigned to any pair of [[parallel morphisms]] in $J$ (i.e., with same source and target in $J$) are equal.  If $J$ is a directed graph, as is more common when we speak about "commutative" diagrams, then this definition has to be applied to $F(J)$ instead.

In either case, $J$ may be called the __shape__, __scheme__, or __index__ category or graph.


## Examples

* The shape of the **empty diagram** is the [[initial object|initial category]] with no object and no morphism. 

  Every category $C$ admits a unique diagram whose shape is the empty ([[initial object|initial]]) category, which is called the **empty diagram** in $C$.

* The shape of the **terminal diagram** is the [[terminal category]] $J = \{*\}$ consisting of a single object and a single morphism (the identity morphism on that object). 

  Specifying a diagram in $C$ whose shape is $\{*\}$ is the same as specifying a single [[object]] of $C$, the image of the unique object of $1$. (See [[global element]])


* A diagram of the shape $\{a \to b\}$ in $C$ is the choice of any one [[morphism]] $F_{a b} : X_a \to X_b$ in $C$.

  Notice that strictly speaking this counts as a _commuting diagram_ , but is a degenrate case of a commuting diagram, since there is only a single morphism involved, which is necessarily equal to itself.

* A diagram of shape the [[poset]] indicated by

  $$
    \left\{
      \array{
         a &\to& b
         \\
         \downarrow && \downarrow
         \\
         b' &\to& c
      }
    \right\}
  $$

  is a **commuting square** in $C$: this is a choice of four (not necessarily distinct!) objects $X_a, X_b, X_{b'}, X_c$ in C, together with a choice of (not necessarily distinct) four morphisms $F_{a b} : X_a \to X_b$, $F_{b c} : X_b \to X_c$ and $F_{a b'} : X_a \to X_{b'}$, $F_{b' c} : X_{b'} \to X_c$ in $C$, such that the composite morphism $F_{b c}\circ F_{a b}$ equals the composite $F_{b' c}\circ F_{a b'}$.

  One typically "draws the diagram" as

  $$
      \array{
         X_a &\stackrel{F_{a b}}{\to}& X_b
         \\
         {}^{\mathllap{F_{a b'}}}\downarrow && 
        \downarrow^{\mathrlap{F_{b c}}}
         \\
         X_{b'} &\stackrel{F_{b' c}}{\to}& X_{c}
      }    
  $$

  in $C$ and says that _the diagram commutes_ if the above equality of composite morphisms holds.

  Notice that the original poset had, necessarily, a morphism $a \to c$ and could have equivalently be depicted as

  $$
    \left\{
      \array{
         a &\to& b
         \\
         \downarrow &\searrow& \downarrow
         \\
         b' &\to& c
      }
    \right\}
  $$

  in which case we could more explicitly draw its image in $C$ as

  $$
      \array{
         X_a &\stackrel{F_{a b}}{\to}& X_b
         \\
         {}^{\mathllap{F_{a b'}}}\downarrow &\searrow^{\stackrel{F_{b c}\circ F_{a b}}{= F_{b' c}\circ F_{a b'}}}& 
        \downarrow^{\mathrlap{F_{b c}}}
         \\
         X_{b'} &\stackrel{F_{b' c}}{\to}& X_{c}
      }    
  $$


* A pair of objects is a diagram whose shape is a [[discrete category]] with two objects.


* A pair of [[parallel morphisms]] is a diagram whose shape is a category 
  $J = \{a \stackrel{\to}{\to} b\}$
  with two objects and two morphisms from one to the other. 

  Notice that if we required  $\{a \stackrel{\to}{\to} b\}$ to be a [[poset]] this would necessarily make these two morphisms equal, and hence reduce this example to the one where $J = \{a \to b\}$. 

* A [[span]] is a diagram whose shape is a category with just three objects and single morphisms from one of the objects to the other two; 

  $$
    J = \left\{
      \array{
        && a
        \\
        & \swarrow && \searrow
        \\
        b &&&& c
      }
    \right\}
  $$

  dually, a [[cospan]] is a diagram whose shape is [[opposite category|opposite]] to the shape of a span.

  $$
    J = \left\{
      \array{
        b &&&& c
        \\
        & \searrow && \swarrow
        \\
        && a
      }
    \right\}
  $$

* A [[transfinite composition]] diagram is one of the shape the [[poset]] indicated by

  $$
    J = 
    \left\{
     \array{
      a_0 &\to& a_1 &\to& \cdots 
      \\
      & \searrow & \downarrow & \swarrow & \cdots 
      \\
      && b
     }
    \right\}
    \,,
  $$

  where the indices may range over the [[natural number]]s or even some more general [[ordinal number]].

  This is non-finite commuting diagram.
