## Idea

Informally, a **diagram** in a [[category]] $C$ consists of some [[objects]] of $C$ connected by some [[morphisms]] of $C$.  Frequently when doing category theory, we "draw diagrams" such as
$$\array{A & \overset{f}{\to} & B\\
  ^h\downarrow && \downarrow^k\\
  C& \underset{g}{\to} & D}$$
by drawing some objects (or dots labeled by objects) connected by arrows labeled by morphisms.

There are two natural ways to give the notion of "diagram" a formal definition.  One is to say that a diagram is a [[functor]], usually one whose domain is a (very) [[small category]].  This level of generality is sometimes convenient.

On the other hand, a more direct representation of what we draw on the page, when we "draw a diagram," only involves labeling the vertices and edges of a [[directed graph]] (or [[quiver]]) by objects and morphisms of the category.  This sort of diagram can be identified with a functor whose domain is a [[free category]], and this is the most common context when we talk about diagrams "commuting."


## Definitions

Let $C$ be a [[category]].

### Diagrams as functors

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition
If $J$ is a category, then a __diagram__ in $C$ of shape $J$ is simply a [[functor]] $D\colon J \to C$.
=--

This terminology is often used when speaking about [[limits]] and [[colimits]]; that is, we speak about "the limit or colimit of a diagram."  Similarly, it is common to call the [[functor category]] $C^J$ the "category of diagrams in $C$ of shape $J$".

### Diagrams as graph morphisms

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition
If $J$ is a [[quiver]], then a __diagram__ in $C$ of shape $J$ is a functor $D\colon F(J) \to C$, or equivalently a graph morphism $\bar{D}\colon J \to U(C)$.
=--

Here $F\colon Quiv \to Cat$ denotes the [[free category]] on a quiver and $U\colon Cat \to Quiv$ the underlying quiver of a category, which form a pair of [[adjoint functors]].  These are the sorts of diagrams which we "draw on a page" --- we draw a quiver, and then label its vertices with objects of $C$ and its edges with morphisms in $C$, thereby forming a graph morphism $J\to U(C)$.

## Remarks

* For either sort of diagram, $J$ may be called the __shape__, __scheme__, or __index__ category or graph.

* Note that given a diagram $F:J\to C$, the image of the shape $J$ is not necessarily a [[subcategory]] of $C$, even if $J$ is itself a category.  This is because the functor $F$ could identify objects of $J$, thereby producing new potential composites which do not exist in $J$.  (Sometimes one talks about the "image" of a functor as a subcategory, but this really means the subcategory *generated* by the image in the literal objects-and-morphisms sense.)


## Commutative diagrams

If $J$ is a category, then a diagram $J\to C$ is __[[commutative diagram|commutative]]__ if it factors through a [[preorder]].  Equivalently, a diagram of shape $J$ commutes iff any two morphisms in $C$ that are assigned to any pair of [[parallel morphisms]] in $J$ (i.e., with same source and target in $J$) are equal.

If $J$ is a quiver, as is more common when we speak about "commutative" diagrams, then a diagram of shape $J$ commutes if the functor $F(J) \to C$ factors through a preorder.  Equivalently, this means that given any two parallel *paths* of arbitrary finite length (including zero) in $J$, their images in $C$ have equal composites.


## Examples

* The shape of the **empty diagram** is the [[initial object|initial category]] with no object and no morphism. 

  Every category $C$ admits a unique diagram whose shape is the empty ([[initial object|initial]]) category, which is called the **empty diagram** in $C$.

* The shape of the **terminal diagram** is the [[terminal category]] $J = \{*\}$ consisting of a single object and a single morphism (the identity morphism on that object). 

  Specifying a diagram in $C$ whose shape is $\{*\}$ is the same as specifying a single [[object]] of $C$, the image of the unique object of $1$. (See [[global element]])


* A diagram of the shape $\{a \to b\}$ in $C$ is the choice of any one [[morphism]] $F_{a b} : X_a \to X_b$ in $C$.

  Notice that strictly speaking this counts as a _commuting diagram_ , but is a degenerate case of a commuting diagram, since there is only a single morphism involved, which is necessarily equal to itself.

* If $J$ is the quiver with one object $a$ and one endo-edge $a\to a$, then a diagram of shape $J$ in $C$ consists of a single [[endomorphism]] in $C$.  Since $a\to a$ and the zero-length path are parallel in $J$, such a diagram only commutes if the endomorphism is an identity.  Note, in particular, that a single endomorphism can be considered as a diagram with more than one shape (this one and the previous one), and that whether this diagram "commutes" depends on the chosen shape.

* A diagram of shape the [[poset]] indicated by

  $$
    \left\{
      \array{
         a &\to& b
         \\
         \downarrow && \downarrow
         \\
         b' &\to& c
      }
    \right\}
  $$

  is a **commuting square** in $C$: this is a choice of four (not necessarily distinct!) objects $X_a, X_b, X_{b'}, X_c$ in C, together with a choice of (not necessarily distinct) four morphisms $F_{a b} : X_a \to X_b$, $F_{b c} : X_b \to X_c$ and $F_{a b'} : X_a \to X_{b'}$, $F_{b' c} : X_{b'} \to X_c$ in $C$, such that the composite morphism $F_{b c}\circ F_{a b}$ equals the composite $F_{b' c}\circ F_{a b'}$.

  One typically "draws the diagram" as

  $$
      \array{
         X_a &\stackrel{F_{a b}}{\to}& X_b
         \\
         {}^{\mathllap{F_{a b'}}}\downarrow && 
        \downarrow^{\mathrlap{F_{b c}}}
         \\
         X_{b'} &\stackrel{F_{b' c}}{\to}& X_{c}
      }    
  $$

  in $C$ and says that _the diagram commutes_ if the above equality of composite morphisms holds.

  Notice that the original poset had, necessarily, a morphism $a \to c$ and could have equivalently be depicted as

  $$
    \left\{
      \array{
         a &\to& b
         \\
         \downarrow &\searrow& \downarrow
         \\
         b' &\to& c
      }
    \right\}
  $$

  in which case we could more explicitly draw its image in $C$ as

  $$
      \array{
         X_a &\stackrel{F_{a b}}{\to}& X_b
         \\
         {}^{\mathllap{F_{a b'}}}\downarrow &\searrow^{\stackrel{F_{b c}\circ F_{a b}}{= F_{b' c}\circ F_{a b'}}}& 
        \downarrow^{\mathrlap{F_{b c}}}
         \\
         X_{b'} &\stackrel{F_{b' c}}{\to}& X_{c}
      }    
  $$

* By contrast, a diagram whose shape is the *quiver*
  $$
    \left\{
      \array{
         a &\to& b
         \\
         \downarrow && \downarrow
         \\
         b' &\to& c
      }
    \right\}
  $$
  is a not-necessarily-commuting square.  The free category on this quiver differs from the poset in the previous example by having *two* morphisms $a\to c$, one given by the composite $a\to b\to c$ and the other by the composite $a\ to b'\to c$.  But the poset in the previous category is the poset reflection of this $F(J)$, so a diagram of this shape commutes, in the sense defined above, iff it is a commuting square in the usual sense.


* A pair of objects is a diagram whose shape is a [[discrete category]] with two objects.


* A pair of [[parallel morphisms]] is a diagram whose shape is a category 
  $J = \{a \stackrel{\to}{\to} b\}$
  with two objects and two morphisms from one to the other. 

  Notice that if we required  $\{a \stackrel{\to}{\to} b\}$ to be a [[poset]] this would necessarily make these two morphisms equal, and hence reduce this example to the one where $J = \{a \to b\}$.  In other words, a diagram of this shape only *commutes* if the two morphisms are equal.

* A [[span]] is a diagram whose shape is a category with just three objects and single morphisms from one of the objects to the other two; 

  $$
    J = \left\{
      \array{
        && a
        \\
        & \swarrow && \searrow
        \\
        b &&&& c
      }
    \right\}
  $$

  dually, a [[cospan]] is a diagram whose shape is [[opposite category|opposite]] to the shape of a span.

  $$
    J = \left\{
      \array{
        b &&&& c
        \\
        & \searrow && \swarrow
        \\
        && a
      }
    \right\}
  $$

* A [[transfinite composition]] diagram is one of the shape the [[poset]] indicated by

  $$
    J = 
    \left\{
     \array{
      a_0 &\to& a_1 &\to& \cdots 
      \\
      & \searrow & \downarrow & \swarrow & \cdots 
      \\
      && b
     }
    \right\}
    \,,
  $$

  where the indices may range over the [[natural number]]s or even some more general [[ordinal number]].

  This is a non-finite commuting diagram.
