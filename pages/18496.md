## Idea

A _compactly supported distribution_ is a [[distribution]] whose [[support of a distribution]] is a [[compact topological space|compact]] [[subset]].

This implies that compactly supported distributions may be evaluated not just on [[bump functions]], but in fact on the larger space of all [[smooth functions]]. Indeed it turns out that the compactly supported distributions exhaust the [[continuous linear functionals]] on the space of smooth functions ([Hörmander 90, theorem 2.3.1](#Hoermander90)).

Therefore and since Schwartz's notation for the space $C^\infty(X)$ of all smooth functions on the given [[smooth manifold]] is $\mathcal{E}(X)$, the space of compactly supported distributions is often denoted by $\mathcal{E}'(X)$ ([Hörmander 90, p. 45](#Hoermander90)).

###### Definition
**([[topological vector space]] of [[smooth functions]] on a [[Cartesian space]])**

For $n \in \mathbb{R}^n$,  write $C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)$ for the $\mathbb{R}$-[[vector space]] of [[smooth functions]] $\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$.

This becomes a [[Fréchet space]] induced by the family of [[seminorms]] 
$$
  \array{
    C^\infty_c(\mathbb{R}^n) 
     &\overset{p_{K}^\alpha}{\longrightarrow}&
    [0,\infty)
    \\
    \Phi &\mapsto& \underset{x \in K}{sup} {\vert \partial^\alpha \Phi(x) \vert}
  }
$$

indexed by a [[countable set]] of [[compact subspaces]] $K \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ exhausting $\mathbb{R}^n$ and by a [[tuple]] $\alpha \in \mathbb{N}^n$ and give by sending a [[bump function]] $\Phi$ to the [[supremum]] over the points $x \in K$ of the [[absolute value]] of the [[partial derivative]] of $\Phi$ that is indexed by $\alpha$.

We write

$$
  \mathcal{E}(\mathbb{R}^n) \in TopVect_{\mathbb{R}}
$$

for the resulting [[topological vector space]].

###### Definition
**(compactly supported distibutions as continuous linear duals to bump functions)**

The space $\mathbb{E}'(\mathbb{R}^n)$ of _compactly supported distributions_ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ is the [[dual space]]

$$
  \mathcal{E}'(\mathbb{R}^n) \;\coloneqq\; \left(\mathcal{E}(\mathbb{R}^n)\right)^\ast
$$

to the [[topological vector space]] of [[bump functions]] from def. \ref{TVSOfCompactlySupportedFunctions}.

### As smooth linear duals to smooth functions

We may regard $\mathbb{R}^n$ as a [[diffeological space]], hence as a [[smooth set]]. For $X$ any [[smooth set]] we write $[X,\mathbb{R}]$ for the [[mapping space]] (the [[internal hom]] in the [[topos]] of [[smooth sets]]) of smooth functions from $X$ to $\mathbb{R}$. The underlying set is $C^\infty(X)$. If $X$ itself has $\mathbb{R}$-linear structure, we write 

$$
  [X,\mathbb{R}]_{\mathbb{R}}
  \hookrightarrow
  [[X,\mathbb{R}], \mathbb{R}]
$$

for the [[subobject]] of $\mathbb{R}$-linear maps. Concretely, for $U$ a [[smooth manifold]] (or just a [[Cartesian space]]), then the [[sheaf]] $[X,\mathbb{R}]$ assigns (see at _[[closed monoidal structure on presheaves]]_ for details)

$$
  [X,\mathbb{R}](U) = C^\infty(U \times X)
$$

and $[X,\mathbb{R}](U) \subset C^\infty(U \times X)$ is the subset of those functions $\Phi_{(-)}(-)$ such that for all $u \in U$ the function $\Phi_u \colon X \to \mathbb{R}$ is $\mathbb{R}$-linear. 

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

There is a [[natural bijection]] between the underlying sets of compactly supported distributions (def. \ref{CompactlySupportedDistributionsAsContinuousLinearDualsToBumpFunctions}) and the $\mathbb{R}$-linear [[mapping space]] formed in [[smooth sets]]:

$$
  \widetilde{(-)}
  \mathcal{E}'(\mathbb{R}^n)
    \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  Hom_{SmoothSet}([\mathbb{R}^n, \mathbb{R}], \mathbb{R})_{\mathbb{R}}
$$

given by sending $\mu \in \mathcal{E}'(\mathbb{R}^n)$ to the [[natural transformation]] which on a test space $U \in $ [[CartSp]] takes $\Phi_{(-)}(-) \colon U \times \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ evaluates $\mu$ pointwise in $U$:

$$
  \tilde \mu(\Phi_{(-)})(u)
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \langle \mu, \Phi_{u}\rangle
  \,.
$$

=--

([Moerdijk-Reyes 91, chapter II, prop. 3.6](#MoerdijkReyes91))


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

To see that $\widetilde{(-)}$ is well defined, we need to check that the function

$$
  \array{
     U 
     &\overset{
     \tilde \mu(\Phi_{(-)})}{\longrightarrow}&
     \mathbb{R}
     \\
     u &\mapsto& \langle \mu, \Phi_u\rangle
  }
$$

is [[smooth function|smooth]]. But this follows immediately since $\langle \mu,-\rangle$ by definition is [[linear function|linear]] and [[continuous function|continuous]].


To see that $\widetilde{(-)}$ is indeed a [[bijection]] for each $U$ it remains that every $\mathbb{R}$-linear smooth functional (morphisms of [[smooth sets]]) of the form

$$
  A \;\colon\; [\mathbb{R}^n,\mathbb{R}] \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$

when restricted on [[global elements]] to a [[function]] of sets

$$
  A(\ast) \;\colon\; C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n) \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$

is [[continuous function|continuous]] with respect to the [[topological vector space]] structure from def. \ref{TVSOfCompactlySupportedFunctions} on the left.

Now by definition of the [[internal hom]] $A$ is actually "path-smooth" and hence the statement is implied by this lemma.
