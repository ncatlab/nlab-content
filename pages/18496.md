## Idea

A _compactly supported distribution_ is a [[distribution]] whose [[support of a distribution]] is a [[compact topological space|compact]] [[subset]].

This implies that compactly supported distributions may be evaluated not just on [[bump functions]], but in fact on the larger space of all [[smooth functions]]. Indeed it turns out that the compactly supported distributions exhaust the [[continuous linear functionals]] on the space of smooth functions ([Hörmander 90, theorem 2.3.1](#Hoermander90)).

Therefore and since Schwartz's notation for the space $C^\infty(X)$ of all smooth functions on the given [[smooth manifold]] is $\mathcal{E}(X)$, the space of compactly supported distributions is often denoted by $\mathcal{E}'(X)$ ([Hörmander 90, p. 45](#Hoermander90)).
