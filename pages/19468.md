###### Definition
**(trivial coverage)**

For $\mathcal{C}$ a [[small category]], the _trivial coverage_ is the [[coverage]] with no [[covering]] families at all, meaning that the [[sheaf|sheaf condition]] over the resulting [[site]] is empty, in that _every_ [[presheaf]] is a [[sheaf]] for this coverage.

=--

Hence the [[category of presheaves]] $[\mathcal{C}^{op},Set]$ over a site $\mathcal{C}_{triv}$ with trivial coverage is already the corresponding [[category of sheaves]], hence the corresponding [[sheaf topos]]:

$$
  Sh\left( \mathcal{C}_{triv}\right)
  \;\simeq\;
  [\mathcal{C}^{op}, Set]
  \,.
$$
