>There are several things called "Birkhoff's theorem" in various field of mathematics and mathematical physics, and belong even to at least 2 different classical Birkhoff's. Even wikipedia has pages for more than one such theorem. To me the first which comes to mind is Birkhoff's factorization theorem, now also popular in Kreimer-Connes-Marcolli work and in connection to loop groups (cf. book by Segal and Pressley).

For now we have:

* the [[Birkhoff–von Neumann theorem]]
