## Idea

In the strict sense of the word, a _cartesian product_ is a [[product]] in [[Set]], the category of [[sets]].

More generally, one says _cartesian product_ to mean the  [[product]] in any [[cartesian monoidal category]] and to distinguish it from other [[tensor product]]s that this may carry.

For instance one speaks of the cartesian product on [[Cat]] and on [[2Cat]] in contrast to the [[Gray tensor product]].


## Definition 

Given any family $(A_i)_{i:I}$ of sets, the __cartesian product__ $\prod_i A_i$ of the family is the set of all [[functions]] $f$ from the index set $I$ with $f_j$ in $A_j$ for each $j$ in $I$.

As stated, the [[target]] of such a function depends on the argument, which is natural in dependent [[type theory]]; but if you don't like this, then define $\prod_i A_i$ to be the set of those functions $f$ from $I$ to the [[disjoint union]] $\biguplus_i A_i$ such that $f_j \in A_j$ (treating $A_j$ as a [[subset]] of $\biguplus_i A_i$ as usual) for each $j$ in $I$.

In traditional forms of [[set theory]], one can also take the target of $f$ to be the [[union]] $\bigcup_i A_i$ or even the class of all objects (equivalently, leave it unspecified).


## Special cases 

Given sets $A$ and $B$, the cartesian product of the binary family $(A,B)$ is written $A \times B$; its elements $(a,b)$ are called __[[ordered pairs]]__.  (In [[set theory]], one often makes a special definition for this case, defining
$$ (a,b) = \{\{a\},\{a,b\}\} $$
rather than as a function so that ordered pairs can then be used in the definition of function.  From a structural perspective, however, this is unnecessary.)

Given sets $A_1$ through $A_n$, the cartesian product of the $n$-ary family $(A_1,\ldots,A_n)$ is written $\prod_{i=1}^n A_i$; its elements $(a_1,\ldots,a_n)$ are called __ordered $n$-[[tuples]]__.

Given sets $A_1$, $A_2$, etc, the cartesian product of the countably infinitary family $(A_1,A_2,\ldots)$ is written $\prod_{i=1}^\infty A_i$; its elements $(a_1,a_2,\ldots,)$ are called __infinite [[sequences]]__.

Given a set $A$, the cartesian product of the unary family $(A)$ may be identified with $A$ itself; that is, we identify the __ordered [[singleton]]__ $(a)$ with $a$.

The cartesian product of the empty family $()$ is the [[point]], a set whose only element is the __[[empty list]]__ $()$; we often call this set $1$ (or $\pt$, when we\'re Urs) and write its element as $*$.


## Foundational status

In [[material set theory]], the existence of binary cartesian products follows from the [[axiom of pairing]] and the axiom of [[weak replacement]] (which is very weak).  In [[structural set theory]], their existence generally must be stated as an axiom: the __axiom of products__.  See [[ordered pair]] for more details.
