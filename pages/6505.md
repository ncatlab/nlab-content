The moment map came up historically as a generalization of [[angular momentum]] in the [[rigid body dynamics|dynamics of rigid bodies]].

The basic setup is the following: Let $(M,\omega)$ be a [[symplectic manifold]] with a [[Hamiltonian action]] of a [[Lie group]] $G$. In particular that means that there is an [[action]] $\nu\colon G \times M \to M$ via [[symplectomorphism]]s (diffeomorphisms $\nu_g$ such that $\nu_g^*(\omega) = \omega$). A vector field $X$ is [[symplectic]] if the corresponding flow preserves (again by pullbacks) $\omega$. The symplectic vector fields form a Lie subalgebra $\xhi(M,\omega)$ of the Lie algebra of all smooth vector fields $\chi(M)$ on $M$ with respect to the Lie bracket. 

By the [[Cartan homotopy formula]] and closedness $d \omega = 0$

$$
\mathcal{L}_X \omega = d \iota_X \omega
$$

where $\mathcal{L}_X$ denotes the [[Lie derivative]]. Therefore a vector field $X$ is symplectic iff $\iota(X)\omega = d H$ for some function $H\in C^\infty(M)$, usually called Hamiltonian (function) for $X$. Here $X$ is determined by $H$ up to a locally constant function. Such $X = X_H$ is called the __Hamiltonian vector field__ corresponding to $H$.  The Poisson structure on $M$ is the bracket $\{,\}$ on functions may be given by 

$$
\{ f, g\} := [X_f,X_g]
$$

where there is a Lie bracket of vector fields on the right hand side.

There is an exact sequence

$$
0 \to \mathbf{R}\to C^\infty(M)\to \chi(M,\omega)
$$

and $H^1(M, \mathbf{R})$ measures hgow far is the right-most map from the identity. Thus there is a possible difference between the set of symplectic vector fields and of Hamiltonian vector fields only if the manifold is not simply connected. __Hamiltonian action__ above means that the action induced at the level of Lie algebra is by Hamiltonian vector fields. That means that the infinitesimal action from $\mathfrak{g}\to \chi(M,\omega)$ lifts to a linear map

$$
\mathfrak{g}\to C^\infty(M); \,\,\,\,\,A\mapsto \mu_A
$$ 

One usually dualizes that map. The __moment map__

$$\mu: M\to \mathfrak{g}^*$$

is determined by the formula 

$$
\langle \mu(z),A\rangle = \mu_A(z),\,\,\,\,\,\,\forall z\in M.
$$

The moment map is a crucial ingredient in the construction of Marsden--Weinstein [[symplectic quotient]]s.
