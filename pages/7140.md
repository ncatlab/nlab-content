## Idea

Let $\Omega$ be a domain in a [[complex manifold]] and let $P \subset \Omega$ be a (complex-) analytic subset which is [[empty subset|empty]] or of [[codimension]] one. A [[holomorphic function]] $f$ defined on the [[complement]] $\Omega \setminus P$ is called a _meromorphic function_ in $\Omega$ if for every point $p \in P$ one can find an arbitrarily small [[neighbourhood]] $U$ of $p$ in $\Omega$ and functions $\phi$, $\psi$ holomorphic in $U$ without common non-invertible factors in $Int(U)$, such that $f = \phi/\psi$ in $U \setminus P$.

In one complex dimension (one complex variable), hence on a [[Riemann surface]], a _meromorphic function_ is a [[complex numbers|complex]]-[[analytic function]] which is defined away from a set of isolated points. Equivalently this is a [[holomorphic function]] with values in the [[Riemann sphere]].  Compare a [[holomorphic function]], which is valued in the [[complex plane]] (the Riemann sphere minus a point).
