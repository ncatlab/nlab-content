This page collects material related to 

* [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Alfred Whitehead]]

  _Principia Mathematica_

  1910

an early account aiming to lay [[foundations of mathematics]].

Among other things, this book, inspired by work of [[Gottlob Frege]], introduces concepts of [[type theory|typing]], called the "extensional hierarchy of type" to prevent [[paradoxes]] of [[set theory]] such as [[Russell's paradox]], and a
"[ramified hierarchy of types](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Mathematica#Ramified_types_and_the_axiom_of_reducibility)", in order to avoid [[paradoxes]] such as the [[liar's paradox]].
(See also [SEP -- Type theory](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/type-theory/)).
