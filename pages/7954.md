## Idea

> This entry is being splitt-off from _[[BRST-BV formalism]]_. For the moment see the discussion there at _[Hamiltonian BFV](BV-BRST+formalism#HamiltonianBV)_.

## Properties

* [[Guillemin-Sternberg geometric quantization conjecture]]

## Related concepts

* [[Hamiltonian action]]


The analog for [[presymplectic manifolds]] is [[presymplectic reduction]].

The analog for [[Poisson manifolds]] is [[Poisson reduction]].
