## Idea

In [[intuitionistic mathematics]], the concept of _choice sequence_ introduced by [[L.E.J. Brouwer]] is a [[constructive mathematics|constructive]] notion of _[[sequence]]_ that admits "free choices" (i.e. not necessarily "determined by a law").

This has been formalized in various ways, sometimes by writing down axioms that follow from Brouwer's philosophical description, other times by constructing models such as sheaf [[toposes]].
