#Morava K-theory
* table of contents
{:toc}

## Idea

For each [[prime]] $p$, the Morava K-theories are a tower $\{K(n)\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of [[complex oriented cohomology theories]] whose [[coefficient]] [[ring]] is

$$
  \pi_\bullet\left(K\left(n\right)\right)
  \simeq
  \mathbb{F}_p [v_n, v_n^{-1}]
$$

where $v_n$ is in degree $2(p^n-1)$.

Hence with $p = 2$ for $n = 1$ $v_1$ is a [[Bott element]] of degree 2 and $K(1)$ is closely related to [[complex K-theory]], while for $n= 2$ $v_2$ is then a [[Bott element]] of degree 6 and $K(2)$ is closely related to [[elliptic cohomology]].

There is also [[integral Morava K-theory]] which instead has coefficient ring

$$
  \pi_\bullet\left(K\left(n\right)\right)
  \simeq
  \mathbb{Z}_{(p)} [v_n, v_n^{-1}]
  \,,
$$

where $\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$ is the [[localization]] of the integers at the given [[prime]].

Integral Morva K-theory can be obtained as a localization of a quotient $MU/I$ of [[complex cobordism cohomology theory]] $MU$ ([Buhné 11](#Buhne11)).



## Definition

We need the following standard notation throughout this entry.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For $p \in \mathbb{N}$ a [[prime number]], we write

* $\mathbb{F}_p = \mathbb{Z}/(p)$ for the [[field]] with $p$ elements;

* $\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$ for the [[localization of a ring|localization ring]] of the [[integers]] at $p$;

* $\mathbb{Z}_p$ for the [[p-adic integers]].

=--

### Construction from complex cobordism

(e.g. [Lurie 10, lecture 22, def. 5](#LurieLecture))

### Axiomatic characterization

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition/Definition

For each [[prime number|prime integer]] $p$ there exists a sequence of [[multiplicative cohomology theory|multiplicative]] [[generalized cohomology theories|generalized cohomology]]/[[generalized homology theories|homology theories]] 

$$
  \{K(n)\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}
$$ 

with the following properties:

1. $K(0)_\ast(X)=H_\ast(X;\mathbb{Q})$ and $\overline{K(0)}_\ast(X)=0$ when $\overline{H}_\ast(X)$ is all [[torsion]].

1. $K(1)_\ast(X)$ is one of $p-1$ isomorphic summands of mod-$p$ complex [[topological K-theory]]. 

1. $K(0)_\ast(pt.)=\mathbb{Q}$ and for $n\neq 0$, $K(n)_\ast(pt.)=\mathbb{F}_p[v_n,v_n^{-1}]$ where $\vert v_n\vert=2p^n-2$.  

   (This [[ring]] is a graded [[field]] in the sense that every graded [[module]] over it is [[free module|free]].  $K(n)_\ast(X)$ is a module over $K(n)_\ast(pt.)$, see [below](#AsInfinityFields))

1. There is a [[Künneth isomorphism]]: $K(n)_\ast(X\times Y)\cong K(n)_\ast(X)\otimes_{K(n)_\ast(pt.)}K(n)_\ast(Y).$

1. Let $X$ be a p-local finite [[CW-complex]]. If $\overline{K(n)}_\ast(X)$ vanishes then so does $\overline{K(n-1)}_\ast(X)$.

1. If $X$ as above is not contractible then $\overline{K(n)}_\ast(X)=K(n)_\ast(pt.)\otimes \overline{H}_\ast(X;\mathbb{Z}/(p))$.

These are called the _Morava K-theories_.


=--

Due to the third point one may regard $K(n)$ as a [[∞-field]] among the [[A-infinity rings]]. See [below](#AsInfinityFields).

## Properties

### Universal characterization

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

For each [[prime number]] $p$ and each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the Morava K-theory $K(n)$ is, up to [[equivalence in an (∞,1)-category|equivalence]], the unique [[spectrum]] underlying an [[H-space|homotopy associative]] spectrum which is

1. [[complex oriented cohomology theory|complex oriented]];

1. whose [[formal group]] has [[height of a formal group|height]] exactly $n$;

1. whose [[homotopy groups]] are $\pi_\bullet \simeq \mathbb{F}_p[v_n^\pm]$. (with $v_n$ defined as at _[[height of a formal group|height]]_).

=--

For instance ([Lurie, lecture 24, prop. 11](#LurieLecture)).

### Ring structure

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition


$K(n)$ admits the structure of an [[A-∞ algebra]], in fact of an $MU_{(p)}$-[[A-∞ algebra]]. 

=--

Due to Robinson (and [[Andrew Baker]] at $p = 2$). (See e.g. [Lurie 10, lecture 22, lemma 2](#LurieLecture))

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

With the exception of the extreme case of $n=0$, the fields $K(n)$ do not admit [[E-∞-ring]] multiplicative structures. However, when $p\neq 2$, the multiplication is homotopy commutative. For $p = 2$ it is _not_ even homotopy commutative. Nevertheless, for many spaces $X$, the $K(n)$-[[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology|generalized cohomology]] at the prime $2$ of $X$ forms a commutative ring.

=--

(e.g. [Lurie 10, lecture 22, warning 6](#LurieLecture))


### As $A_\infty$-fields
 {#AsInfinityFields}

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

If $E$ is an [[∞-field]] then $E \otimes K(n) \neq 0$ and $E$ admits the structure of a $K(n)$-[[module spectrum|module]].

=--

This appears for instance as ([Lurie, lecture 24, prop. 9, remark 13](#LurieLecture))

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

This means that the Morava $A_\infty$-rings $K(n)$ are essentially the only [[∞-fields]] in the [[stable homotopy category]].

=--

See ([Lurie, lecture 24, remark 13](#LurieLecture))


### As the primes in the $\infty$-category of spectra

The Morava K-theories label the [[prime spectrum of a symmetric monoidal stable (∞,1)-category]] of the [[(∞,1)-category of spectra]] for [[p-localization|p-local]] and [[finite spectra]] . This is the content of the _[[thick subcategory theorem]]_.


### Relation to chromatic homotopy theory

The layers in the [[chromatic homotopy theory|chromatic tower]] capture periodic phenomena in [[stable homotopy theory]], corresponding to the Morava K-theory $E_\infty$-fields.

Specifically the [[Bousfield localization of spectra]] $L_{K(n)}$ acts on [[complex oriented cohomology theories]] like completion along the locally closed substack

$$
  \mathcal{M}^n_{FG}
  \hookrightarrow
  \mathcal{M}_{FG}
$$

of the [[moduli stack of formal groups]] at those of [[height of a formal group|height]] $n$.

[[!include chromatic tower examples - table]]


### Relation to Bousfield lattice

It is known that in the [[Bousfield lattice]] of the [[stable homotopy category]], the Bousfield classes of the Morava K-theories are minimal. It is conjectured by [[Mark Hovey]] and John Palmieri that the [[Boolean algebra]] contained in the Bousfield lattice is atomic and generated by the Morava K-theories and the spectra $A(n)$ which measure the failure of the [[telescope conjecture]].

### Orientation
 {#Orientation}

The [[orientation in generalized cohomology|orientation]] of [[integral Morava K-theory]] is discussed in ([Sati-Kriz 04](#SatiKriz04), [Buhné 11](#Buhne11)). It is essentially given by the vanishing of the seventh [[integral Stiefel-Whitney class]] $W_7$. 

Notice that this is in higher analogy to how [[orientation in generalized cohomology|orientation]] in [[complex K-theory]] is given by the vanishing third [[integral Stiefel-Whitney class]] $W_3$ ([[spin^c-structure]]).

### $\infty$-Group rings and twists

Write $gl_1(K(n))$ for the [[∞-group of units]] of the (a) Morava K-theory spectrum

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

For $p = 2$ and all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, there is an [[equivalence in an (infinity,1)-category|equivalence]]

$$
  Maps(B^{n+1}U(1), B gl_1(K(n)))
  \simeq
  \mathbb{Z}_2
$$

between 

* the [[mapping space]] from the [[classifying space]] for [[circle n-bundle|circle (n+1)-bundles]] to the [[delooping]] of the [[∞-group of units]] of $K(n)$

and 

* the [[p-adic integers|2-adic integers]].

=--

([Sati-Westerland 11, theorem 1](#SatiWesterland11))

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

By the discussion at [[(∞,1)-vector bundle]] this means that for each such map there is a type of [[twisted cohomology|twist]] of Morava K-theory (at $p = 2$).
