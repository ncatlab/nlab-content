## Idea

In the context of [[homological algebra]], the _$Tor$-functor_ is the  
[[left derived functor]] of the [[tensor product]] of $R$-[[modules]], for $R$ a [[commutative ring]].

Together with the [[Ext-functor]] it constitutes one of the central operations of interest in homological algebra.

## Definition

Given a [[ring]] $R$ the [[bifunctor]] $\otimes_R : Mod_{R}\times _{R}Mod\to Ab$
from two copies of $R$-[[Mod]] to [[Ab]] is a [[right exact functor]]. Its 
[[leftderived functors]] are the **Tor-functors

$$
  Tor(-,B)
  : 
  Mod_R \to Ab
$$ 

and 

$$
  Tor(A,-)
  : 
  Mod_R \to Ab
$$ 

with respect to one argument with fixed another, if they exist, are parts of a bifunctor 

$$
  Tor : Mod_{R}\times _{R}Mod\to Ab
  \,.
$$ 

## Properties

### Existence and balancing

If there are sufficiently many [[projective objects]] in both $Mod_{R}$ and $_{R}Mod$, both are equal to balancing $Tor$, which is the bifunctor obtained by taking the homology of [[total complex]] of a [[double complex]] of $Hom$-s in which $A\otimes B$ is resolved by taking a projective resolution in each argument. 

### Relation to torsion groups
 {#RelationToTorsionGroups}

An [[abelian group]] is called _[[torsion]]_ if its elements are nilpotent.

###### Proposition

Let $A$ and $B$ be [[abelian groups]]. Write $Tor^\mathbb{Z}$ for the left derived functor of tensoring over $R = \mathbb{Z}$.  Then

1. $Tor^\mathbb{Z}_1(A,B)$ is a [[torsion group]].

1. $Tor^{\mathbb{Z}}_1^(\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}, A)$ is the [[torsion subgroup]] of $A$.

1 $A$ is a [[torsiofree group]] precisely if $Tor^\mathbb{Z}_1(A,-) = 0$, equivalently if $Tor^\mathbb{Z}_1(-,A) = 0$.

###### Remark

Analogous results fail, in general, for $\mathbb{Z}$ replaced by another ring $R$.
