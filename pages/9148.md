## Idea

The _Ising model_ is a simple [[model (in theoretical physics)]] of [[physical systems]] roughly similar to ferromagnets. Its configurations are functions on a lattice with values in $\{-1,+1\}$, roughly to be thought of as the magnetic polarizations of elementrary magnets in a crystal lattice.

The Ising model gained importance as a toy model in theoretical [[physics]]. It is about the simplest possuble model that allows methods of [[quantum field theory]] in [[statistical physics]] and the study of [[critical phenomena]]. In fact at a critical [[tempertature]] and in [[dimension]] 2 the model exibits the behaviour of a [[conformal field theory]], one of the examples of [[rational conformal field theory]].

Real-world [[physical systems]] that show behaviour described by the Ising model were only found later ([Wolf](#Wolf)).
