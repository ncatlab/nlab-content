## Idea

The identification of [[particle]] species with [[irreducible representation|irreducible]] [[unitary representations]] of the [[symmetry group]] acting on [[matter]] [[field (physics)|fields]] over [[spacetime]]. Named after [[Eugene Wigner]].

For details see at 

* _[[unitary representation of the Poincaré group]]_.

* _[[unitary representation of the super Poincaré group]]_.

Usese a method that goes back to Frobenius and came to be known as "Wigner's little group method" or the "Mackey machine" ([Mackey 68](#Mackey68)).
