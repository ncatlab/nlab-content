## Idea

The _Cardy condition_ is part of the [[sewing constraint]] consistency condition on data that gives an [[open string|open]]-[[closed string|closed]] [[2d CFT]] or [[2d TQFT]].

It is the algebraic reflection of the fact that the following two [[cobordisms]] are equivalent (as topological as well as as conformal cobordisms):

1. an [[open string]] coming in, closing to a [[closed string]] and then opening up again to an open string (the "zip-unzip cobordism");

1. an [[open string]] coming in, splitting into two open strings, these crossing each other (with the endpoints of one of them at the same time making a full rotation), then both merging again to one open string.

(e.g. [Lauda-Pfeiffer 05 (3.44)](#LaudaPfeiffer05), [Kong 06, figure 3](#Kong06))

For instance in the classification of open-closed [[2d TQFT]] with [[coefficients]] in [[Vect]] via [[Frobenius algebras]], this means that for $O$ the Frobenius algebra of open string states and for $C$ the commutative Frobenius algebra of closed string states, then the canonical [[linear function]]

$$
  O \longrightarrow C \longrightarrow O
$$

is equal to the canonical map

$$
  O \stackrel{\Delta}{\longrightarrow} O \otimes O
  \stackrel{\tau}{\longrightarrow}
  O \otimes O
  \stackrel{\mu}{\longrightarrow}
  O
  \,,
$$

where $\mu$ is the [[coalgebra|coproduct]], $\mu$ the product and $\tau$ the [[braided monoidal category|braiding]] (e.g. [Lauda-Pfeiffer 05 (2.14)](#LaudaPfeiffer05)).
