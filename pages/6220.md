## Definition

Given a [[linear algebraic group]] $G$ (i.e. an [[algebraic group|algebraic]] [[subgroup]] of the [[general linear group]] $GL(n,k)$ where $k$ is a [[field]]), a subgroup $P\subset G$ is said to be __parabolic__ if it is closed in [[Zariski topology]] and the [[quotient]] variety $G/P$ is [[projective variety|projective]]. A minimal (with respect to inclusion) parabolic subgroup of a linear algebraic group is called a [[Borel subgroup]]; in fact, given a Borel subgroup $B$, any closed subgroup $P\supset B$ is parabolic.  

The [[Cartan geometry]] of parabolic subgroup inclusions is _[[parabolic geometry]]_.
