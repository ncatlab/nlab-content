Given a [[linear algebraic group]] $G$ (i.e. an algebraic subgroup of $GL(n,k)$ where $k$ is a field), a subgroup $P\subset G$ is said to be __parabolic__ if it is closed in [[Zariski topology]] and the question variety $G/P$ is [[projective variety|projective]]. A minimal (with respect to inclusion) parabolic subgroup of a linear algebraic group is called a [[Borel subgroup]]; in fact, given a Borel subgroup $B$, any closed subgroup $P\supset B$ is parabolic.
