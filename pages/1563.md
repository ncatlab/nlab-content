## Topics

### Main contributions

Lawvere invented [[categorical logic]] and introduced the eponymous [[Lawvere theories]] as a [[category theory|category-theoretic]] way to describe finitary [[algebraic theories]].  He generalised [[Grothendieck toposes]] to [[elementary toposes]], revolutionising the [[foundations]] of [[mathematics]]; in this vein, he developed the [[foundation]] in [[structural set theory]] called [[ETCS]].  He also introduced and worked on [[synthetic differential geometry]] as a foundation for [[differential geometry]] and [[equations of motion]] in [[continuum physics]]. Later he introdcued the notion of _[[cohesive topos]]_ as a more general foundation of [[geometry]]. 


### Relation to Hegelian ontology

Lawvere's work tends to adopt terminology from  [[Georg Hegel]]'s _[[Science of Logic]]_, for instance in the term "categories of [[being]] and [[becoming]]" for [[cohesive toposes]] in _[[Some Thoughts on the Future of Category Theory]]_ and in the emphasis of the duality between [[intensive and extensive]] in _[[Categories in Continuum Physics]]_.

Indeed, Lawvere essentially proposed that [[Hegel]]'s "[[unity of opposites]]" is usefully formalized by the notion of [[adjoint triples]] inducing [[adjoint pairs]] of [[idempotent monad|idempotent]] ([[comonad|co]]-)[[monads]]. For more on this see at _[Science of Logic -- Formalization of unity of opposites](Science+of+Logic#OppositesAndUnity)_


### Motivation from foundations of physics
 {#MotivationFromFoundationsOfPhysics}

A central motivation for Lawvere's work is the search for a good  mathematical [[foundations]] of [[physics]], specifically of ([[classical physics|classical]]) [[continuum mechanics]] (or at least some [[kinematics|kinematical]] aspects thereof, Lawvere does not seem to mention [[Hamiltonians]], [[Lagrangians]] or [[action functionals]]).

In ([interview, p. 8](http://www.mat.uc.pt/~picado/lawvere/interview.pdf)) he recalls:

> I had been a student at Indiana University from 1955 to January 1960. I liked [[experiment|experimental]] [[physics]] but did not appreciate the imprecise reasoning in some theoretical courses. So I decided to study [[mathematics]] first. [[Clifford Truesdell|Truesdell]] was at the Mathematics Department but he had a great knowledge in Engineering Physics. He took charge of my education there. $[...]$ in 1955 (and subsequently) had advised me on pursuing the study of [[continuum mechanics]] and [[kinetic theory]]. 

> In Summer 1958 I studied [[topological dynamics|Topological Dynamics]] with George Whaples, with the agenda of understanding as much as possible in categorical terms.  $[...]$ Categories would clearly be important for simplifying the foundations of [[continuum physics]]. I concluded that I would make category theory a central line of my study. 

Then in ([interview, p. 11](http://www.mat.uc.pt/~picado/lawvere/interview.pdf)) about the early 1960s:

> I felt a strong need to learn more [[set theory]] and [[logic]] from experts in that field, still of course with the aim of clarifying the foundations of [[category theory]] and of [[physics]].

The title of the early text _[[Toposes of laws of motion]]_, which is often cited as the text introducing [[synthetic differential geometry]], clearly witnesses the origin and motivation of these ideas in [[classical mechanics]].


On this, in ([interview, p. 15](http://www.mat.uc.pt/~picado/lawvere/interview.pdf)):


> Q: As an assistant professor in Chicago, in 1967, you taught with Mac Lane a course on [[mechanics|Mechanics]], where you "started to think about the justication of older intuitive methods in geometry"7 You called it "[[synthetic differential geometry]]". How did you arrive at the program of [[Categorical dynamics|Categorical Dynamics]] and [[synthetic differential geometry|Synthetic Differential Geometry]]?

> A: From January 1967 to August 1967 I was Assistant Professor at the University of Chicago. Mac Lane and I soon organized to teach a joint course based on Mackey's book "Mathematical Foundations of [[quantum mechanics|Quantum Mechanics]]". 

> Q: So, Mackey, a functional analyst from Harvard mainly concerned with the relationship between quantum mechanics and representation theory, had some relation to category theory.

Then ([interview, p. 16](http://www.mat.uc.pt/~picado/lawvere/interview.pdf)):

> Q: Back to the origins of Synthetic Dierential Geometry, where did the idea of organizing such a joint course on Mechanics originate ? Apparently, Chandra had suggested that Saunders give some courses relevant to physics, and our joint course was the rst of a sequence. Eventually Mac Lane gave a talk about the [[Hamilton-Jacobi equation]] at the Naval Academy in summer 1970 that was published in the American Mathematical Monthly

> A: $[...]$ I began to apply the Grothendieck topos theory that I had learned from Gabriel to the problem of simplied foundations of [[continuum mechanics]] as it had been inspired by [[Clifford Truesdell|Truesdell]]'s teachings, [[Walter Noll|Noll]]'s [[axiom|axiomatizations]], and by my 1958 efforts to render categorical the subject of [[topological dynamics]].

A review of this with more comments on more relations to physics is in the introduction to the book collection _[[Categories in Continuum Physics]]_, which is the proceedings of a meeting organized by Lawvere in 1982.

In the talk _[[Toposes of laws of motion]]_ in 1997, Lawvere starts with the following remark

> I read somewhere recently that the basic program of infinitesimal [[calculus]], [[continuum mechanics]], and [[differential geometry]] is that all the world can be reconstructed from the [[infinitesimal object|infinitely small]]. One may think this is not possible, but nonetheless it’s certainly a program that has been very fruitful over the last 300 years. I think we are now finally in a position to actually make more explicit what that program amounts to.

> $[...]$ I think that on the basis of these developments we can focus on this question of making very explicit how [[continuum physics]] etc. can be built up mathematically from very simple ingredients.

In the same talk, a few lines later after discussion of [[infinitesimally thickened points]] $T$, it says:

> The basic [[spaces]] which are needed for [[functional analysis]] and theories of [[physical fields]] are thus in some sense available in any [[topos]] with a suitable [[object]] $T$.


In 2000 in the article_[[Comments on the development of topos theory]]_ Lawvere writes in the closing section 7 titled "From and to continuum physics":

> What was the impetus which demanded the simplification and generalization of [[Grothendieck]]'s concept of [[topos]], if indeed the application to [[logic]] and [[set theory]] were not decisive. $[...]$ My own motivation came from my earlier study of [[physics]]. The [[foundation]] of the [[continuum physics]] of general materials, in the spirit of [[Clifford Truesdell|Truesdell]], [[Walter Noll|Noll]] and others, involves powerful and clear physical ideas, which unfortunately have been submerged under a mathematical apparatus $[...]$. But, as Fichera $[25]$ lamented, all this apparatus gives often a very uncertain fit to the phenomena. The apparatus may well be helpful in the solution of certain problems, but can the problems themselves and the needed axioms be stated in a direct and clear manner? And might this not lead to a simpler, equally rigorous account? These were the questions to which I began to apply the [[topos]] method in my 1967 Chicago lectures $[$ _[[Categorical dynamics]]_ $]$. It was clear that work on the notion of topos itself would be needed to achieve the goal. I had spent 1961-62 with the Berkeley logicians, believing that listening to experts on [[foundations]] might be the road to clarifying foundational questions. 

> $[...]$ Several books treating the simplified [[topos theory]] ([[Sheaves in Geometry and Logic|MacLane-Moerdijk]] being the most recent and readable text), together with the three excellent books on [[synthetic differential geometry]] $[...]$ provide a solid basis on which further treatment of [[functional analysis]] and the needed development of [[continuum physics]] can be based.


The [Wikipdia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lawvere) concludes:

> Lawvere continues to work on his 50-year quest for a rigorous flexible base for physical ideas, free of unnecessary analytic complications.
