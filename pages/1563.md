## Topics

### Main contributions

Lawvere invented [[categorical logic]] and introduced the eponymous [[Lawvere theories]] as a [[category theory|category-theoretic]] way to describe finitary [[algebraic theories]].  He generalised [[Grothendieck toposes]] to [[elementary toposes]], revolutionising the [[foundations]] of [[mathematics]]; in this vein, he developed the [[foundation]] in [[structural set theory]] called [[ETCS]].  He also introduced and worked on [[synthetic differential geometry]] as a foundation for [[differential geometry]] and [[equations of motion]] in [[continuum physics]]. Later he introdcued the notion of _[[cohesive topos]]_ as a more general foundation of [[geometry]]. 




### Mathematics relating to Phyiscs
 {#MotivationFromFoundationsOfPhysics}

A central motivation for Lawvere's work is the search for a good  mathematical [[foundations]] of [[physics]], specifically of ([[classical physics|classical]]) [[continuum mechanics]] (or at least some [[kinematics|kinematical]] aspects thereof, Lawvere does not seem to mention [[Hamiltonians]], [[Lagrangians]] or [[action functionals]]).

In ([interview, p. 8](http://www.mat.uc.pt/~picado/lawvere/interview.pdf)) he recalls:

> I had been a student at Indiana University from 1955 to January 1960. I liked [[experiment|experimental]] [[physics]] but did not appreciate the imprecise reasoning in some theoretical courses. So I decided to study [[mathematics]] first. [[Clifford Truesdell|Truesdell]] was at the Mathematics Department but he had a great knowledge in Engineering Physics. He took charge of my education there. $[...]$ in 1955 (and subsequently) had advised me on pursuing the study of [[continuum mechanics]] and [[kinetic theory]]. 

> In Summer 1958 I studied [[topological dynamics|Topological Dynamics]] with George Whaples, with the agenda of understanding as much as possible in categorical terms.  $[...]$ Categories would clearly be important for simplifying the foundations of [[continuum physics]]. I concluded that I would make category theory a central line of my study. 

Then in ([interview, p. 11](http://www.mat.uc.pt/~picado/lawvere/interview.pdf)) about the early 1960s:

> I felt a strong need to learn more [[set theory]] and [[logic]] from experts in that field, still of course with the aim of clarifying the foundations of [[category theory]] and of [[physics]].

The title of the early text _[[Toposes of laws of motion]]_, which is often cited as the text introducing [[synthetic differential geometry]], clearly witnesses the origin and motivation of these ideas in [[classical mechanics]].


On this, in ([interview, p. 15](http://www.mat.uc.pt/~picado/lawvere/interview.pdf)):


> Q: As an assistant professor in Chicago, in 1967, you taught with Mac Lane a course on [[mechanics|Mechanics]], where you "started to think about the justication of older intuitive methods in geometry"7 You called it "[[synthetic differential geometry]]". How did you arrive at the program of [[Categorical dynamics|Categorical Dynamics]] and [[synthetic differential geometry|Synthetic Differential Geometry]]?

> A: From January 1967 to August 1967 I was Assistant Professor at the University of Chicago. Mac Lane and I soon organized to teach a joint course based on Mackey's book "Mathematical Foundations of [[quantum mechanics|Quantum Mechanics]]". 

> Q: So, Mackey, a functional analyst from Harvard mainly concerned with the relationship between quantum mechanics and representation theory, had some relation to category theory.

Then ([interview, p. 16](http://www.mat.uc.pt/~picado/lawvere/interview.pdf)):

> Q: Back to the origins of Synthetic Differential Geometry, where did the idea of organizing such a joint course on Mechanics originate ? Apparently, Chandra had suggested that Saunders give some courses relevant to physics, and our joint course was the first of a sequence. Eventually Mac Lane gave a talk about the [[Hamilton-Jacobi equation]] at the Naval Academy in summer 1970 that was published in the American Mathematical Monthly

> A: $[...]$ I began to apply the Grothendieck topos theory that I had learned from Gabriel to the problem of simplied foundations of [[continuum mechanics]] as it had been inspired by [[Clifford Truesdell|Truesdell]]'s teachings, [[Walter Noll|Noll]]'s [[axiom|axiomatizations]], and by my 1958 efforts to render categorical the subject of [[topological dynamics]].

A review of this with more comments on more relations to physics is in the introduction to the book collection _[[Categories in Continuum Physics]]_, which is the proceedings of a meeting organized by Lawvere in 1982.

In the talk _[[Toposes of laws of motion]]_ in 1997, Lawvere starts with the following remark

> I read somewhere recently that the basic program of infinitesimal [[calculus]], [[continuum mechanics]], and [[differential geometry]] is that all the world can be reconstructed from the [[infinitesimal object|infinitely small]]. One may think this is not possible, but nonetheless it’s certainly a program that has been very fruitful over the last 300 years. I think we are now finally in a position to actually make more explicit what that program amounts to.

> $[...]$ I think that on the basis of these developments we can focus on this question of making very explicit how [[continuum physics]] etc. can be built up mathematically from very simple ingredients.

In the same talk, a few lines later after discussion of [[infinitesimally thickened points]] $T$, it says:

> The basic [[spaces]] which are needed for [[functional analysis]] and theories of [[physical fields]] are thus in some sense available in any [[topos]] with a suitable [[object]] $T$.


In 2000 in the article _[[Comments on the development of topos theory]]_ Lawvere writes in the closing section 7 titled "From and to continuum physics":

> What was the impetus which demanded the simplification and generalization of [[Grothendieck]]'s concept of [[topos]], if indeed the application to [[logic]] and [[set theory]] were not decisive. $[...]$ My own motivation came from my earlier study of [[physics]]. The [[foundation]] of the [[continuum physics]] of general materials, in the spirit of [[Clifford Truesdell|Truesdell]], [[Walter Noll|Noll]] and others, involves powerful and clear physical ideas, which unfortunately have been submerged under a mathematical apparatus $[...]$. But, as Fichera $[25]$ lamented, all this apparatus gives often a very uncertain fit to the phenomena. The apparatus may well be helpful in the solution of certain problems, but can the problems themselves and the needed axioms be stated in a direct and clear manner? And might this not lead to a simpler, equally rigorous account? These were the questions to which I began to apply the [[topos]] method in my 1967 Chicago lectures $[$ _[[Categorical dynamics]]_ $]$. It was clear that work on the notion of topos itself would be needed to achieve the goal. I had spent 1961-62 with the Berkeley logicians, believing that listening to experts on [[foundations]] might be the road to clarifying foundational questions. 

> $[...]$ Several books treating the simplified [[topos theory]] ([[Sheaves in Geometry and Logic|MacLane-Moerdijk]] being the most recent and readable text), together with the three excellent books on [[synthetic differential geometry]] $[...]$ provide a solid basis on which further treatment of [[functional analysis]] and the needed development of [[continuum physics]] can be based.


The [Wikipdia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lawvere) concludes:

> Lawvere continues to work on his 50-year quest for a rigorous flexible base for physical ideas, free of unnecessary analytic complications.

### Mathematics relating to Philosophy
 {#RelationToPhilosophy}

Lawvere has proposed formalizations in [[category theory]], [[categorical logic]] and [[topos theory]] of concepts which are motivated from [[philosophy]], notably in [[Georg Hegel]]'s _[[Science of Logic]]_ (see there for more). This includes for instance definitions of concepts found there such as: 

* _[[objective and subjective logic]], _[[abstract general]]_, _[[concrete general]]_, _[[concrete particular]]_, _[[unity of opposites]]_, _[[Aufhebung]]]_, _[[being]]_, _[[becoming]]_, _[[space and quantity]]_, _[[cohesion]]_, _[[intensive and extensive quantity]]_ 

(see the references in these entries for pointers).

In ([Lawvere 02](#Lawvere92)) it says:

> It is my belief that in the next decade and in the next century the technical advances forged by category theorists will be of value to dialectical philosophy, lending precise form with disputable mathematical models to ancient philosophical distinctions such as general vs. particular, objective vs. subjective, being vs. becoming, space vs. quantity, equality vs. difference, quantitative vs. qualitative etc. In turn the explicit attention by mathematicians to such philosophical questions is necessary to achieve the goal of making mathematics (and hence other sciences) more widely learnable and useable. Of course this will require that philosophers learn mathematics and that mathematicians learn philosophy.

A precursor to this undertaking is [[Hermann Grassmann]] with his _[[Ausdehnungslehre]]_ ([Lawvere 95](#Lawvere95)), see there for more.
