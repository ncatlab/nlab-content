## Idea

In [[mathematics]], the statement of an *exercise* is typically the same as that of a [[lemma]], [[proposition]] or [[theorem]], but the attitude towards its [[proof]] is different:

An __exercise__ is for the reader to fill in a [[proof]], in private. The reader may seek help from whomever, but the idea is to practice.  A great many exercises have been publicly solved, and a great many [[theorems]] have not, thus confusing which are which, though it's generally good practice to treat them *all* as exercises and ignore published [[proofs]], within the constraints of available time and balancing of competing priorities.

When a proposition is *called* an exercise, this means at least that the omission of a proof is deliberate (or that its inclusion is accidental), but the author is confident of being able to produce one, given enough patience.
