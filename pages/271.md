A nonabelian cocycle is, generally, a cocycle in [[nonabelian cohomology]].

This means usually that it is modeled in either of the following two ways:

* a descent datum, i.e. an object in the category of  [[descent]] data (sometimes shortly called descent category);

* an $\omega$-[[anafunctor]].

Notice that for $n\geq 2$, descent data in a setup of strict $n$-categories still make a strict $n$-category, while the anafunctors form weak $n$-category.
