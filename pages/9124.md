## Definition

A context of [[differential cohesion]] is determined by the existence of an [[adjoint triple]] of  [[modalities]]

$$
  \Re \dashv \Im \dashv \&
  \,,
$$


where $Re$ and $\&$ are [[idempotent monad|idempotent]] [[comonads]] and $\Im$ is an [[idempotent monad]].
Here $\Im$ is called the _[[infinitesimal shape modality]]_. 

An [[object]]/[[type]] $X$ is called **formally smooth** if the [[unit of an adjunction|unit]]

$$
  X \to \Im X
$$

is a [[1-epimorphism]]. This is equivalent to the essentially unique morphism $X \to *$ to the [[terminal object]] being a [[formally smooth morphism]].
