## Definition

A context of [[differential cohesion]] is determined by the existence of an [[adjoint triple]] of  [[modalities]]

$$
  Red \dashv &#643;_{inf} \dashv \flat_{inf}
  \,,
$$

where $Red$ and $\flat_{inf}$ are [[idempotent monad|idempotent]] [[comonads]] and $&#643;_{inf}$ is an [[idempotent monad]].
Here $&#643;_{inf}$ is called the _[[infinitesimal shape modality]]_. 

An [[object]]/[[type]] $X$ is called **formally smooth** if the [[unit of an adjunction|unit]]

$$
  X \to &#643;_{inf}X
$$

is a [[1-epimorphism]]. This is equivalent to the essentially unique morphism $X \to *$ to the [[terminal object]] being a [[formally smooth morphism]].
