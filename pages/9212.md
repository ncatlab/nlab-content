
An $n \times n$-[[matrix]] $U \in Mat(n, \mathbb{C})$ with entries in the [[complex numbers]] (for $n$ a [[natural number]]) is **unitary** if the following equivalent conditions hold

* it preserves the canonical [[inner product]] on $\mathbb{C}^n$;

* the operation $(-)^\dagger$ of [[transpose matrix|transposing]] it and then applying [[complex conjugation]] to all its entries takes it to its inverse:

  $$
    U^\dagger = U^{-1}
    \,.
  $$

For fixed $n$, the unitary matrices under [[matrix product]] form a [[Lie group]]: the _[[unitary group]]_ $\mathrm{U}_n$ (or other notations such as $U(n)$).
