
An $n \times n$-[[matrix]] $U \in Mat(n, \mathbb{C})$ with entries in the [[complex numbers]] is **unitary** if the following equivalent conditions hold

* it preserves the canonical [[inner product]] on $\mathbb{C}^n$;

* the operation $(-)^\dagger$ of [[transpose matrix|transposing]] it and then appying [[complex conjugation]] to all its entries takes it to itself:

  $$
    U^\dagger = U
    \,.
  $$

The unitary matrices under [[matrix product]] form a [[Lie group]]: the _[[unitary group]]_.
