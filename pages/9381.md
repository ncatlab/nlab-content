## Idea

In a [[local topos]] there is a notion of _[[concrete objects]]_. These form a [[reflective subcategory]]. The corresponding reflector is the _concretification map_ which universally approximates any object by a concrete object.

## Definition

There is a unique evident notion of concretification in any [[local topos]], this we discuss first in 

* _[In a local topos](#InALocalTopos)_

This involves an [[image]] factorization. Since in [[higher category theory]]/[[homotopy theory]] image factorization refines to a tower of notions of [[n-image]] factorization in a [[local (∞,1)-topos]] there are different constructions that one may all think of as concretification. This we discuss in 

* _[In a higher cohesive topos](#InAHigherCohesiveTopos)_


### In a local topos
 {#InALocalTopos}

A [[local topos]] is a [[topos]] equipped with a [[sharp modality]] $\sharp$. 

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For $X$ any object of the topos, the [[image]] projection of the [[unit of a monad|unit]] $\iota_X \colon X \to \sharp X$ is the _concretification_ of $X$

$$
  (X \to Conc X) 
  \coloneqq
  (X \to im(\iota_X))
  \,.
$$

### In a cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos
 {#InAHigherCohesiveTopos}

In a [[local (∞,1)-topos]] there is still the [[sharp modality]], but here the [[1-image]]-factorization of its unit is rarely of interest, for this concretifies an object in degree 0 but makes it [[codiscrete object|codiscrete]] in all higher degrees. Typically one is interested in concretifying in all degrees. One needs to specify extra data to say what this means.

One case where this is arises is the _differential concretification_ of [[moduli ∞-stacks]] of [[principal ∞-connections]].


## Examples

### Concretification of differential moduli
 {#ConcretificationOfDifferentialModuli}

Let $\mathbf{H}$ be a [[local (∞,1)-topos]] which in addition is a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] equipped with [[differential cohesion]]. Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and let $\mathbb{G} \in Grp(\mathbf{H})$ be an [[∞-group]] which  is admits and is equipped with $(n+1)$-[[deloopings]] $\{\mathbf{B}^k \mathbb{G}\}_{k = 0}^{n+1}$. (For instance for $n = 2$ this is a [[sylleptic ∞-group]].  Generally we can have an [[abelian ∞-group]].)

Then for each $0 \leq k \lt n$ there is a canonical object $\mathbf{B}^l\mathbb{G}_{conn} \in \mathbf{H}$, the [[moduli ∞-stack]] of $(\mathbf{B}^{k}\mathbb{G})$-[[principal ∞-connections]] (as discussed there). By assumption on $\mathbb{H}$ these are for $k \lt n-1$ each canoncally [[∞-group]] objects themselves (have a canonically given [[delooping]]). This induces a sequence of forgetful maps

$$  
  \mathbf{B}^n\mathbb{G}_{conn}
  \to 
  \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{B}^{n-1}\mathbb{G}_{conn})
  \to
  \mathbf{B}^2(\mathbf{B}^{n-2}\mathbb{G}_{conn})
  \to 
  \cdots
  \mathbf{B}^{n-1}(\mathbf{B}\mathbb{G}_{conn})
  \to 
  \mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{G}
$$

which interpolates between the moduli for $(\mathbf{B}^{n-1}\mathbb{G})$-[[principal ∞-connections]] and plain $(\mathbf{B}^{n-1}\mathbb{G})$-[[principal ∞-bundles]] by succesively "forgetting connection data from below". 

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

For instance for $\mathbf{H} = $ [[Smooth∞Grpd]], $\mathbb{G} = U(1) \in Grp(\mathbf{H})$ the [[circle Lie group]] and $n = 2$, the sequence

$$
  \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)_{conn}
  \to 
  \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{B}U(1)_{conn})
  \to 
  \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)
$$

modulates [[circle 2-bundles with connection]] mapping to circle 2-connections "without [[curving]]", mapping to the underlying [[circle 2-group]]-[[principal 2-bundles]]/[[bundle gerbes]].

=--

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For $\Sigma \in \mathbf{H}$ any [[object]], the **differential concretification** of the [[internal hom]] ([[mapping ∞-stack]]) $[\Sigma, \mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{G}_{conn}]$ is the iterated [[(∞,1)-pullback]]

$$
  (\mathbf{B}^{n-1}\mathbb{G})
  \mathbf{Conn}(\Sigma)
  \;
  \coloneqq
  \;
  \sharp_1 [\Sigma, \mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{G}_{conn}]
  \underset{
    \sharp_1 [\Sigma, \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{B}^{n-1}\mathbb{G}_{conn})]
  }{\times}
  \sharp_2 [\Sigma, \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{B}^{n-1}\mathbb{G}_{conn})]
  \underset{\sharp_2 [\Sigma, \mathbf{B}^2(\mathbf{B}^{n-2}\mathbb{G}_{conn})]}{\times}
  \cdots
  \underset{\sharp_{n-1}[\Sigma, \mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{G}]}{\times}
  [\Sigma, \mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{G}]
  \,,
$$


where $\sharp_k(-)$ denotes the [[n-image|k-image]] of the [[unit of a monad|unit]] of the [[sharp modality]] $\sharp$.

###### Example

Again in $\mathbf{H} = $ [[Smooth∞Grpd]] and for $\mathbb{G} = U(1)$ we find that for all $n$ $(\mathbf{B}^{n-1}U(1))\mathbf{Conn}(X)$ is the [[∞-stack]] which to a $U \in $ [[CartSp]] assigns the [[n-groupoid]] of smoothly $U$-parameterized collections of [[circle n-bundles with connection]] on $\Sigma$, with smoothly $U$-parameterized collectiojns of [[gauge transformations]] between them, smoothly $U$-parameterized collections of [[higher gauge transformations]] between those, etc.
