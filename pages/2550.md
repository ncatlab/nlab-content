## Idea

_Motivic homotopy theory_ or _$\mathbf{A}^1$-homotopy theory_ is the [[homotopy theory]] of smooth [[schemes]], where the [[affine line]] $\mathbf{A}^1$ plays the role of the [[interval]].  Hence what is called the _motivic homotopy category_ or the _$\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy category_ bears the same relation to [[smooth varieties]] that the ordinary [[homotopy category]] $Ho(Top)$ bears to [[smooth manifolds]].

Both are special cases of a [[homotopy theory]] induced by any sufficiently well-behaved [[interval object]] $I$ in a [[site]] $C$. Ordinary homotopy theory is obtained by taking $C$ to be the [[Diff|site of smooth manifolds]] and $I$ to be the [[real line]] $\mathbb{R}$, and $\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy theory over a [[Noetherian scheme]] $S$ is obtained when $C$ is the [[Nisnevich site]] of [[smooth scheme]]s of finite type over $S$ and 

$$
  I \coloneqq \mathbb{A}^1
$$

is the standard [[affine line]] in $C$.

As for the standard homotopy theory, one can furthermore pass to [[spectrum objects]] and consider the [[stable homotopy category]]. In the following we first discuss

* _[The unstable motivic homotopy category](#UnstableCategory)_

and then

* _[The stable motivic homotopy category](#StableCategory)_.




## The unstable motivic homotopy category 
 {#UnstableCategory}

Let $S$ be a fixed [[Noetherian scheme|Noetherian base scheme]], and let $Sm/S$ be the category of [[smooth schemes]] of finite type over $S$.

+-- {: .num_defn #MotivicHomotopyCategory}
###### Definition
The motivic homotopy category $\mathrm{H}(S)$ over $S$ is the [[homotopy localization]] of the [[(∞,1)-topos]] of [[(∞,1)-sheaves]] on the [[Nisnevich site]] $Sm/S$ equipped with the [[interval object]] $\mathbb{A}^1$. Objects of $\mathrm{H}(S)$ are called _motivic spaces_.
=--

Thus, a motivic space over $S$ is an [[(∞,1)-presheaf]] $F$ on $Sm/S$ such that

* $F$ is an [[(∞,1)-sheaf]] for the [[Nisnevich topology]]
* $F$ is _$\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy invariant_: for every $X\in Sm/S$, the projection $X\times\mathbb{A}^1\to X$ induces an [[equivalence]] $F(X)\simeq F(X\times\mathbb{A}^1$).

As for any [[homotopy localization]], the inclusion $\mathrm{H}(S)\subset PSh(Sm/S)$ admits a [[left adjoint]] [[localization functor]], and one can show that it preserves finite (∞,1)-products. This allows us to regard any presheaf on (or object of) $Sm/S$ as an object of $\mathrm{H}(S)$.

The (∞,1)-category $\mathrm{H}(S)$ is a [[locally presentable (∞,1)-category|locally presentable]] and [[locally cartesian closed (∞,1)-category|locally cartesian closed]] (∞,1)-category. However, it is not an [[(∞,1)-topos]] (see Remark 3.5 in [Spitzweck-Østvær, _Motivic twisted K-theory_, pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1008.4915v1.pdf))

### Motivic spheres {#MotivicSpheres}

The **Tate sphere** is the [[pointed object]] of $\mathrm{H}(S)$ defined by

$$ T {:=} \mathbb{A}^1/\mathbb{G}_m, $$

that is, $T$ is the [[homotopy cofiber]] of the inclusion $\mathbb{G}_m\hookrightarrow \mathbb{A}^1$.
More generally, any algebraic [[vector bundle]] $V$ on $S$ (or, equivalently, any [[quasicoherent sheaf|locally free sheaf]] of finite rank on $S$) has an associated _motivic sphere_ given by its _[[Thom space]]_:

$$ S^V {:=} V/V^\times. $$

Thus, $T=S^{\mathbb{A}^1}$.

A crucial observation is that $T$ is the [[suspension]] of $\mathbb{G}_m$ (pointed at $1$):

$$ T \simeq S^1\wedge\mathbb{G}_m. $$

Indeed, this follows from the definition of $T$ and the fact that $(\mathbb{A}^1,1)$ is [[contractible]] as a pointed motivic space. It is common to write, for $p\geq q\geq 0$,

$$ S^{p,q} {:=} S^{p-q}\wedge \mathbb{G}_m^{\wedge q}. $$

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition
There is a canonical equivalence of pointed motivic spaces $T\simeq (\mathbb{P}^1,1)$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The cartesian square

$$
  \array{
    \mathbb{G}_m &\stackrel{}{\to}& \mathbb{A}^1
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbb{A}^1 &\stackrel{}{\to}& \mathbb{P}^1
  }
$$

becomes [[(∞,1)-pushout|homotopy cocartesian]] in the [[Nisnevich site|Nisnevich]] (even [[Zariski site|Zariski]]) (∞,1)-topos. By pointing all schemes at $1$ and using that $(\mathbb{A}^1,1)$ is contractible, we deduce that $(\mathbb{P}^1,1)\simeq S^1\wedge \mathbb{G}_m\simeq T.$
=--


## The stable motivic homotopy category 
 {#StableCategory}

+-- {: .num_defn #StableMotivicHomotopyCategory}
###### Definition

The _stable motivic homotopy category_ $SH(S)$ over $S$ is the [[inverse limit]] of the tower of (∞,1)-categories

$$ \dots \stackrel{\Omega_T}{\to} \mathrm{H}_*(S) \stackrel{\Omega_T}{\to} \mathrm{H}_*(S) \stackrel{\Omega_T}{\to} \mathrm{H}_*(S),$$

where $H(S)$ is the ordinary motivic homotopy category from def. \ref{MotivicHomotopyCategory}, and where $\Omega_T {:=}Hom(T, -)$. An object of the stable motivic homotopy category is called a _motivic [[spectrum]]_ (or _$T$-spectrum_).
=--

Thus, a motivic spectrum $E$ is a sequence of pointed motivic spaces $(E_0,E_1,E_2\dots)$ together with [[equivalences]]

$$ \Omega_T E_{i+1}\simeq E_i. $$

Since $T\simeq \mathbb{P}^1$, we could equivalently use $\mathbb{P}^1$ instead of $T$ in the above definition.

Since $T\simeq S^1\wedge \mathbb{G}_m$, $SH(S)$ is indeed a [[stable (∞,1)-category]].

### Symmetric monoidal structure and universal property
 {#SymmetricMonoidalStructureAndUniversalProperty}

The functor $\Omega^\infty_T\colon SH(S)\to \mathrm{H}_*(S)$ sending a motivic spectrum $E$ to its first component $E_0$ admits a [[left adjoint]] $\Sigma_T^\infty$. One can then equip the category $SH(S)$ with the structure of a [[symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category]] in such a way that the (∞,1)-functor $\Sigma_T^\infty$ can be promoted to a symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-functor. As such, $SH(S)$ is characterized by a [[universal property]]:

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[locally presentable (∞,1)-category|locally presentable]] [[symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category|symmetric monoidal]] [[(∞,1)-category]].
The (∞,1)-functor

$$ Fun^{\otimes, L}(SH(S),\mathcal{C}) \to Fun^{\otimes} (Sm/S, \mathcal{C}), \quad F\mapsto F\circ \Sigma_T^\infty(-)_+ $$

(where $\otimes$ means "symmetric monoidal" and $L$ means "colimit-preserving")
is [[fully faithful]] and its essential image consists of the symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-functors $F\colon Sm/S\to \mathcal{C}$ satisfying:

* [[Nisnevich site|Nisnevich excision]]
* $\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy invariance
* _$T$-stability_: the [[homotopy cofiber]] of $F(\mathbb{G}_m)\to F(\mathbb{A}^1)$ is $\otimes$-invertible.

=--

This is ([Robalo, Corollary 5.11](#Robalo)).

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Similar characterizations exist for [[noncommutative motives]], see at _[Noncommutative motive -- As the universal additive invariant](noncommutative+motive#AsUniversalAditiveInvariant)_.

### Stable motivic spheres {#StableMotivicSpheres}

Because $T\simeq S^{2,1}$, the stable motivic spheres $S^{p,q}$ are defined for all $p,q\in\mathbb{Z}$.

All the other motivic spheres $S^V$, for $V$ a vector bundle on $S$, also become invertible in $SH(S)$. In fact, the [[Picard ∞-groupoid]] of $SH(S)$ receives a map from the [[algebraic K-theory]] of $S$. These invertible objects are all *exotic* in the sense that they are not equivalent to any of the "categorical" spheres $S^n = \Sigma^n\Sigma^\infty_T S_+$. These exotic spheres play an important rôle in the formalism of [[six operations]] in stable motivic homotopy theory (see [Ayoub](#Ayoub)).

### Cohomology theories {#CohomologyTheories}

Any motivic spectrum $E\in SH(S)$ gives rise to a bigraded [[cohomology|cohomology theory]] for smooth $S$-schemes and more generally for motivic spaces:

$$ E^{p,q}(X) {:=} [\Sigma^\infty_T X_+, \Sigma^{p,q} E], $$

as well as a bigraded homology theory:

$$ E_{p,q}(X) {:=} [S^{p,q}, \Sigma^\infty_T X_+ \wedge E]. $$


## Main features


### The six operations {#SixOperations}

The categories $SH(S)$ for varying base scheme $S$ support a formalism of [[six operations]]. This means that to every morphism of schemes $f: X\to Y$ is associated an ([[inverse image]] $\dashv$ [[direct image]])-[[adjunction]]

$$ f^* : SH(Y) \to SH(X) : f_* $$

and, if $f$ is [[separated morphism|separated]] of finite type, a ([[direct image with compact support]] $\dashv$ [[exceptional inverse image]])-adjunction

$$ f_! : SH(X) \to SH(Y): f^!,$$

satisfying the properties listed at [[six operations]]. For more details see [Ayoub](#Ayoub).

**Stable homotopy functors.** To construct the six operations for $SH$, Voevodsky introduced an axiomatic setting which also subsumes the classical case of [[étale cohomology]]. A _stable homotopy functor_ is a contravariant (∞,1)-functor

$$ D\colon Schemes^{op} \to PrStab (\infty,1) Cat, $$

from some category of schemes to the (∞,1)-category $PrStab (\infty,1) Cat$ of [[locally presentable (∞,1)-category|locally presentable]] [[stable (∞,1)-categories]] and colimit-preserving exact functors, satisfying the following axioms (for $f$ a morphism of schemes, we denote $D(f)$ by $f^*$ and its right adjoint by $f_*$):

1. $D(\emptyset)=0$.

2. If $i: X\to Y$ is an immersion of schemes, then $i_*\colon D(X)\to D(Y)$ is [[fully faithful (∞,1)-functor|fully faithful]].

3. (Smooth base change/[[Beck-Chevalley condition]]) If $f$ is [[smooth scheme|smooth]], then $f^*$ admits a left adjoint $f_\sharp$. Moreover, given a cartesian square
$$
  \array{
    Y' &\stackrel{k}{\to}& X'
    \\
    _h\downarrow && \downarrow \;_f
    \\
    Y &\stackrel{g}{\to}& X
  }
$$
with $f$ smooth, there is a canonical equivalence $h_\sharp k^*\simeq g^* f_\sharp$.

4. (Locality) If $i: Z\hookrightarrow X$ is a [[closed immersion]] with open complement $j: U\hookrightarrow X$, then the pair $(i^*,j^*)$ is [[conservative functor|conservative]].

5. (Homotopy invariance) If $p: X\times\mathbb{A}^1\to X$ is the projection, then $p^*$ is [[fully faithful (∞,1)-functor|fully faithful]].

6. ($T$-stability) If $p$ is as above and $s$ is the zero section of $p$, then $p_\sharp s_*: D(X)\to D(X)$ is an [[equivalence of (∞,1)-categories]].

+-- {: .num_theorem}

###### Theorem
(Ayoub, Voevodsky) Every stable homotopy functor admits a formalism of four operations $f^\ast$, $f_\ast$, $f_!$, and $f^!$.
=--

For a more precise statement, see [Ayoub, Scholie 1.4.2](#Ayoub).

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem
$SH$ is a stable homotopy functor.
=--

This is essentially proved in [Morel-Voevodsky](#MorelVoevodsky). In fact, something stronger is expected to be true:

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Expected Theorem
$SH$ is the [[initial object]] in the [[(∞,2)-category]] of stable homotopy functors.
=--

This theorem has not been proved yet; however, [Ayoub's thesis](#Ayoub) shows that every stable homotopy functor factors through $SH$.


### Realization functors {#RealizationFunctors}

**Complex realization.** The functor

$$ Sm/\mathbb{C}\to SmoothMfd,\quad X\mapsto X(\mathbb{C}) $$

associating to a smooth $\mathbb{C}$-scheme $X$ its set of $\mathbb{C}$-points with its structure of [[smooth manifold]] induces a functor from $\mathrm{H}(\mathbb{C})$ to the [[homotopy localization]] of the [[smooth ∞-groupoid|smooth (∞,1)-topos]] at the [[interval object]] $\mathbb{A}^1(\mathbb{C})\simeq \mathbb{R}^2$. As this localization is equivalent to the [[(∞,1)-topos]] $\infty Grpd$ of [[discrete ∞-groupoid]]s, we obtain the _complex realization functor_

$$ \mathrm{H}(\mathbb{C}) \to \infty Grpd. $$

After $T$-stabilization, we obtain a functor from $SH(\mathbb{C})$ to the [[(∞,1)-category of spectra]].

**Real realization.** The functor

$$ Sm/\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{Z}/2-SmoothMfd,\quad X\mapsto X(\mathbb{C}) $$

associating to a smooth $\mathbb{R}$-scheme $X$ its set of $\mathbb{C}$-points with its structure of [[smooth manifold]] together with the action of $\mathbb{Z}/2$ by [[complex conjugation]] induces as in the complex case the _Real realization functor_

$$ \mathrm{H}(\mathbb{R}) \to PSh_\infty(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{Z}/2}), $$

where $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{Z}/2}$ is the [[orbit category]] of $\mathbb{Z}/2$. After $T$-stabilization, we obtain a functor from $SH(\mathbb{R})$ to the (∞,1)-category of [[equivariant stable homotopy theory|genuine]] $\mathbb{Z}/2$-spectra.

**Étale realization.** Over a separably closed field $k$, we can consider the [[étale homotopy|étale homotopy type]] functor

$$ Sh_{\infty}((Sm/k)_{Nis})\to Sh_{\infty}((Sm/k)_{et}) \stackrel{\Pi}{\to} Pro(\infty Grpd) $$

(see [[shape of an (∞,1)-topos]]). However, it does not descend to $\mathrm{H}(k)$ because the étale homotopy type is not $\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy invariant. To rectify this, we choose a prime $l\neq \operatorname{char}(k)$ and consider the reflexive [[localization]] $Pro(\infty Grpd)^\wedge_{l}$ of $Pro(\infty Grpd)$ at the class of maps inducing isomorphisms on pro-homology groups with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}/l$. We then obtain an _étale realization functor_

$$ \mathrm{H}(k) \to Pro(\infty Grpd)^\wedge_{l}. $$

For a non-separably closed field $k$, there is a $Gal(k^{sep}/k)$-equivariant realization analogous to the Real realization.


### The slice filtration {#SliceFiltration}

The slice filtration is a filtration of $\mathrm{H}(S)$ and of $SH(S)$ which is analogous to the [[Postnikov tower in an (∞,1)-category|Postnikov filtration]] for [[(∞,1)-topoi]]. It generalizes the _coniveau filtration_ in [[algebraic K-theory]], the _fundamental filtration_ on [[Witt groups]], and the _weight filtration_ on [[mixed Tate motives]].

If $S$ is [[smooth scheme|smooth]] over a [[field]], the layers of the slice filtration of a motivic spectrum (called its _slices_) are modules over the [motivic Eilenberg–Mac Lane spectrum](#MotivicCohomology) $H(\mathbb{Z})$. At least if $S$ is a [[field]] of characteristic zero, this is the same thing as an integral [[motive]]. The [[spectral sequences]] associated to the slice filtration are analogous to the [[Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence]]s in that their first page consists of [[motivic cohomology]] groups.

### The $\mathbb{A}^1$-Postnikov filtration
{#A1PostnikovFiltration}

One can also consider the filtration on $\mathrm{H}(S)$ induced by the [[Postnikov tower in an (∞,1)-category|Postnikov filtration]] in the containing [[Nisnevich (∞,1)-topos]]. A motivic space is _$\mathbb{A}^1$-n-connected_ if it is [[n-connected]] as a Nisnevich (∞,1)-sheaf, and the _$\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy groups_ $\pi_n^{\mathbb{A}^1}(X,x)$ of a motivic space are its [[homotopy groups in an (∞,1)-topos|homotopy groups]] as a Nisnevich (∞,1)-sheaf.

If $S$ has finite [[Krull dimension]], $\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy groups detect [[equivalences]] because the [[Nisnevich (∞,1)-topos]] is [[hypercomplete]].

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark
 The usage of the $\mathbb{A}^1$- prefix in the above definitions may seem strange since all these notions are simply inherited from the Nisnevich (∞,1)-topos. The point is that, when a smooth scheme $X$ is viewed as a motivic space, a localization functor is implicitly applied. The underlying Nisnevich (∞,1)-sheaf of the motivic space "$X$" can thus be very different from the Nisnevich (∞,1)-sheaf represented by $X$ (for which these definitions would not be interesting at all!).
=--

Intuitively, $\mathbb{A}^1$-connectedness corresponds to the topological connectedness of the _real points_ rather than of the complex points. For example, $\mathbb{G}_m$ is not $\mathbb{A}^1$-connected, and $\mathbb{P}^1$ is $\mathbb{A}^1$-connected but not $\mathbb{A}^1$-simply connected.

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem
Let $k$ be a [[perfect field]] (resp. a [[field]]) and $X$ a [[Nisnevich site|Nisnevich]] (∞,1)-sheaf of spaces (resp. of spectra) on $Sm/k$. If $X$ is [[n-connected]] for some n, then its $\mathbb{A}^1$-localization is also n-connected.
=--
 
This is Morel's _connectivity theorem_ ([Morel, Theorem 5.38](#Morel)). It follows that the $\mathbb{A}^1$-Postnikov filtration on $\mathrm{H}(k)$ "extends" to a [[t-structure]] on the stable (∞,1)-category $SH(k)$, called the _homotopy t-structure_.


### Relation to the theory of motives

The stable motivic homotopy category $SH(S)$ is the basis for several definitions of the [[motive|derived category of mixed motives]] over $S$. See there for more details.

### Relation to the theory of symmetric bilinear forms

Motivic homotopy theory is also related to the classical theory of symmetric [[bilinear forms]] (or [[quadratic forms]] in characteristic $\neq 2$). Invariants such as [[Witt groups]], oriented [[Chow groups]], and [[Hermitian K-theory]] are representable in the motivic homotopy category.

A central theorem of [[Fabien Morel]] states that, if $k$ is a [[field]], the ring of endomorphisms of the motivic sphere spectrum $S^0\in SH(k)$ is canonically isomorphic to the _Grothendieck–Witt ring_ $GW(k)$: this is the [[group completion]] of the [[semiring]] of isomorphism classes of nondegenerate symmetric [[bilinear form]]s over $k$ ([Morel, Corollary 5.43](#Morel)). The case $k=\mathbb{R}$ is especially enlightening: there the stable homotopy class of a pointed endomorphism of $\mathbb{P}^1$ corresponds to the nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form over $\mathbb{R}$ whose dimension is the degree of the induced endomorphism of $\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{C})\simeq S^2$ and whose signature is the degree of the induced endomorphism of $\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{R})\simeq S^1$.

## Equivariant motivic homotopy theory

A general theory of equivariant (unstable and stable) motivic homotopy theory is developed in [Carlsson-Joshua 2014](#CJ2014).

## Applications and examples

### $\mathbb{A}^1$-coverings and the $\mathbb{A}^1$-fundamental groupoid
{#A1coverings}

Like the $\mathbb{A}^1$-[Postnikov filtration](#A1PostnikovFiltration), $\mathbb{A}^1$-coverings and the $\mathbb{A}^1$-fundamental groupoid $\Pi_1^{\mathbb{A}^1}$ are defined in the containing [[Nisnevich (∞,1)-topos]]. A morphism of motivic spaces $f: Y\to X$ is an _$\mathbb{A}^1$-covering_ if it is [[n-truncated object of an (∞,1)-category|0-truncated]] as a morphism between Nisnevich (∞,1)-sheaves. Such a morphism is determined by its 1-truncation $\tau_{\leq 1}f$, and hence there is an equivalence between the category of $\mathbb{A}^1$-coverings of $X$ and that of $\mathbb{A}^1$-invariant objects in the [[classifying topos]] of the Nisnevich sheaf of groupoids
$$ \Pi_1^{\mathbb{A}^1}(X):=\tau_{\leq 1}X. $$

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem
Let $k$ be a [[field]] and $X\in\mathrm{H}_\ast(k)$ a pointed $\mathbb{A}^1$-connected motivic space. Let $\tilde X$ be the $\mathbb{A}^1$-localization of the 1-connected cover of $X$ (as a pointed Nisnevich (∞,1)-sheaf). Then:

1. $\tilde X$ is the initial object in the category of pointed $\mathbb{A}^1$-coverings of $X$.

2. $\tilde X$ is the unique pointed $\mathbb{A}^1$-covering of $X$ which is $\mathbb{A}^1$-simply connected.

3. The Nisnevich sheaf of (unpointed) automorphisms $Aut_X(\tilde X)$ is canonically isomorphic to $\pi_1^{\mathbb{A}^1}(X)$.
=--

This is [Morel, Theorem 6.8](#Morel). The key input for this theorem is the fact that $\Pi_1^{\mathbb{A}^1}(X)$ is $\mathbb{A}^1$-invariant; this is only known for $\mathbb{A}^1$-connected motivic spaces over fields, which explains the hypotheses of the theorem.

When $X$ is a smooth $S$-scheme, examples of $\mathbb{A}^1$-coverings of $X$ include $\mathbb{G}_m$-torsors and finite Galois coverings of degree prime to the characteristics of $X$ ([Morel, Lemma 6.5](#Morel)). This can be used to compute some $\mathbb{A}^1$-fundamental groups, for example:

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition
If $n\geq 2$, $\pi_1^{\mathbb{A}^1}(\mathbb{P}^n)=\mathbb{G}_m$.
=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
The projection $\mathbb{A}^{n+1}-0\to\mathbb{P}^n$ is a $\mathbb{G}_m$-torsor and hence an $\mathbb{A}^1$-covering. If $n\geq 2$, $\mathbb{A}^{n+1}-0$ is moreover $\mathbb{A}^1$-simply connected and hence is the universal $\mathbb{A}^1$-covering of $\mathbb{P}^n$. Thus, $\pi_1^{\mathbb{A}^1}(\mathbb{P}^n)=Aut_{\mathbb{P}^n}(\mathbb{A}^{n+1}-0)=\mathbb{G}_m$.
=--


### $\mathbb{A}^1$-h-cobordisms and the classification of surfaces

An _$\mathbb{A}^1$-h-cobordism_ is a surjective [[proper map]] $X\to\mathbb{A}^1$ in $Sm/S$ such that, for $i=0,1$, the fiber $X_i$ is smooth and the inclusion $X_i\hookrightarrow X$ becomes an equivalence in $\mathrm{H}(S)$.

Asok and Morel used $\mathbb{A}^1$-h-cobordisms to classify rational smooth proper surfaces over [[algebraically closed field]]s up to $\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy. See [Asok-Morel](#AsokMorel).

### Euler classes and splittings of algebraic vector bundles

Let $k$ be a [[perfect field]]. If $X$ is a smooth affine $k$-scheme, Morel proved that

$$ Vect_n(X) \cong [X,BGL_n], $$

where $[-,-]$ denote homotopy classes of maps in the motivic homotopy category $\mathrm{H}(k)$, def. \ref{MotivicHomotopyCategory}. The classical problem of determining whether a [[rank]] $n$ [[vector bundle]] splits off a trivial [[line bundle]] is thus equivalent to determining whether the classifying map $X\to BGL_n$ lifts to $BGL_{n-1}$ in $\mathrm{H}(k)$. If the Nisnevich [[cohomological dimension]] of $X$ is at most $n$, we can use [[obstruction theory]] together with the [[fiber sequence]]

$$ \mathbb{A}^n-0 \to BGL_{n-1} \to BGL_n $$

to obtain the following criterion:

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem
(Morel)
Suppose that $n\geq 2$ and that $X$ has dimension $\leq n$. Let $\xi$ be a vector bundle of rank $n$ over $X$.
Then there exists a canonical class
$$ e(\xi)\in H^n_{Nis}(X,\pi_{n-1}^{\mathbb{A}^1}(\mathbb{A}^n-0)(\mathrm{det} \xi)) $$
which vanishes if and only if $\xi$ splits off a trivial line bundle.
=--

The twist by the determinant $\mathrm{det} \xi$ comes from the nontrivial $\mathbb{A}^1$-fundamental group $\pi_1^{\mathbb{A}^1}(BGL_n)=\mathbb{G}_m$.

The Nisnevich sheaf $\pi_{n-1}^{\mathbb{A}^1}(\mathbb{A}^n-0)$ is the n-th Milnor–Witt K-theory sheaf $\mathbf{K}^{MW}_n$, so that

$$ H^n_{Nis}(X,\pi_{n-1}^{\mathbb{A}^1}(\mathbb{A}^n-0)(\mathrm{det} \xi)) \cong \widetilde{CH}^n(X; \mathrm{det} \xi) $$

is the n-th oriented [[Chow group]] of $X$. When $k$ is [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]], this is just the usual Chow group of $X$ and $e(\xi)$ can be identified with the top Chern class of $\xi$.


### Motivic cohomology {#MotivicCohomology}

Suppose that $S$ is a [[smooth scheme]] over a [[field]]. Then the [[motivic cohomology]] of smooth $S$-schemes is representable in $\mathrm{H}(S)$ and in $SH(S)$. If $A$ is an [[abelian group]] and $p\geq q\geq 0$, there exist a pointed motivic spaces $K(A(q),p)$, called a _motivic Eilenberg–MacLane space_, such that, for every $X\in Sm/S$,

$$ H^{p-r,q-s}(X,A) = [\Sigma^{r,s}X_+, K(A(q),p)]. $$

Voevodsky's _cancellation theorem_ implies that $\Omega_T K(A(q+1), p+2)\simeq K(A(q), p)$. It follows that the sequence of motivic spaces $K(A(n),2n)$ form a $T$-spectrum $H(A)$, called a _motivic Eilenberg–MacLane spectrum_, such that

$$ H^{p,q}(X,A) = [\Sigma_T^\infty X_+, \Sigma^{p,q} H(A)]. $$

If $R$ is a [[commutative ring]], the motivic spectrum $H(R)$ has a canonical structure of $E_\infty$-algebra in $SH(S)$ which induces the ring structure in motivic cohomology.

Unlike in topology, $H(\mathbb{Q})$ is not always equivalent to the rational motivic sphere spectrum $S^0_{\mathbb{Q}}$: this is only the case if $-1$ is a sum of squares in the base field. In general, $H(\mathbb{Q})$ is a direct summand of $S^0_{\mathbb{Q}}$.

The stable (∞,1)-category of $H(\mathbb{Q})$-[[modules]] is equivalent to the [[derived category of mixed motives]]. See there for more details.

### Algebraic K-theory

Suppose that $S$ is a [[regular scheme]]. Then there exists a motivic $\mathbb{P}^1$-spectrum $KGL$ with the property that, for every $X\in Sm/S$,

$$ KGL^{p,q}(X) = K_{2q-p}(X), $$

where $K_*(X)$ are the [[algebraic K-theory]] groups of $X$ defined by [[Daniel Quillen|Quillen]]. In particular, $KGL$-cohomology is $(2,1)$-periodic: this is _Bott periodicity_ for algebraic K-theory.

The multiplicative structure of algebaric K-theory makes $KGL$ into a ring spectrum (up to homotopy), which comes from a unique structure of $E_\infty$-algebra (see [Naumann-Spitzweck-Ostvaer](#NSO11)).

Over non-regular schemes, the motivic spectrum $KGL$ is also defined and it represents Weibel's homotopy invariant version of [[algebraic K-theory]] (see [Cisinski13](#Cis13)).

### Algebraic cobordism
 {#AlgebraicCobordism}

In analogy with the complex cobordism spectrum $MU$, Voevodsky defined the _[[algebraic cobordism spectrum]] _ $MGL \in SH(S)$ (for [[algebraic cobordism]] [[generalized cohomology theory]]) by

$$ MGL = colim_{n\to\infty} \Sigma_T^{\infty -n} V_n/V_n^\times, $$

where $V_n$ is the tautological vector bundle over the infinite Grassmannian of $n$-planes $Gr(n)$. More precisely, $Gr(n)$ is defined as the colimit in $\mathrm{H}(S)$ of the smooth $S$-schemes $Gr(n,k)$ as $k\to\infty$, and $V_n$ is similarly the colimit of the tautological vector bundles over $Gr(n,k)$.

Like $H(\mathbb{Z})$ and $KGL$, $MGL$ is an $E_\infty$ motivic ring spectrum

The spectrum $MGL$ was used by Voevodsky in his proof of the [[Bloch-Kato conjecture]]. It is also the starting point of [[chromatic motivic homotopy theory]].
