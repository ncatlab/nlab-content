## Idea

What is called the _motivic homotopy category_ or the _$\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy category_ bears the same relation to [[smooth varieties]] that the ordinary [[homotopy category]] $Ho(Top)$ bears to [[smooth manifolds]].

Both are special cases of a [[homotopy theory]] induced by any sufficiently well-behaved [[interval object]] $I$ in a [[site]] $C$. Ordinary homotopy theory is obtained by taking $C$ to be the [[Diff|site of smooth manifolds]] and $I$ to be the [[real line]] $\mathbb{R}$, and $\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy theory over a [[Noetherian scheme]] $S$ is obtained when $C$ is the [[Nisnevich site]] of [[smooth scheme]]s of finite type over $S$ and 

$$
  I \coloneqq \mathbb{A}^1
$$

is the standard [[affine line]] in $C$.

As for the standard homotopy theory, one can furthermore pass to [[spectrum objects]] and consider the [[stable homotopy category]]. In the following we first discuss

* _[The unstable motivic homotopy category](#UnstableCategory)_

and then

* _[The stable motivic homotopy category](#StableCategory)_.




## The unstable motivic homotopy category 
 {#UnstableCategory}

Let $S$ be a fixed [[Noetherian scheme|Noetherian base scheme]], and let $Sm/S$ be the category of [[smooth schemes]] of finite type over $S$.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition
The motivic homotopy category $\mathrm{H}(S)$ over $S$ is the [[homotopy localization]] of the [[(∞,1)-topos]] of [[(∞,1)-sheaves]] on the [[Nisnevich site]] $Sm/S$ equipped with the [[interval object]] $\mathbb{A}^1$. Objects of $\mathrm{H}(S)$ are called _motivic spaces_.
=--

Thus, a motivic space over $S$ is an [[(∞,1)-presheaf]] $F$ on $Sm/S$ such that

* $F$ is an [[(∞,1)-sheaf]] for the [[Nisnevich topology]]
* $F$ is _$\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy invariant_: for every $X\in Sm/S$, the projection $X\times\mathbb{A}^1\to X$ induces an [[equivalence]] $F(X)\simeq F(X\times\mathbb{A}^1$).

As for any [[homotopy localization]], the inclusion $\mathrm{H}(S)\subset PSh(Sm/S)$ admits a [[left adjoint]] [[localization functor]], and one can show that it preserves finite (∞,1)-products. This allows us to regard any presheaf on (or object of) $Sm/S$ as an object of $\mathrm{H}(S)$.

The (∞,1)-category $\mathrm{H}(S)$ is a [[locally presentable (∞,1)-category|locally presentable]] and [[locally cartesian closed (∞,1)-category|locally cartesian closed]] (∞,1)-category. However, it is not an [[(∞,1)-topos]] (see Remark 3.5 in [Spitzweck-Østvær, _Motivic twisted K-theory_, pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1008.4915v1.pdf))

### Motivic spheres {#MotivicSpheres}

The **Tate sphere** is the [[pointed object]] of $\mathrm{H}(S)$ defined by

$$ T {:=} \mathbb{A}^1/\mathbb{G}_m, $$

that is, $T$ is the [[homotopy cofiber]] of the inclusion $\mathbb{G}_m\hookrightarrow \mathbb{A}^1$.
More generally, any algebraic [[vector bundle]] $V$ on $S$ (or, equivalently, any [[quasicoherent sheaf|locally free sheaf]] of finite rank on $S$) has an associated _motivic sphere_ given by its _[[Thom space]]_:

$$ S^V {:=} V/V^\times. $$

Thus, $T=S^{\mathbb{A}^1}$.

A crucial observation is that $T$ is the [[suspension]] of $\mathbb{G}_m$ (pointed at $1$):

$$ T \simeq S^1\wedge\mathbb{G}_m. $$

Indeed, this follows from the definition of $T$ and the fact that $(\mathbb{A}^1,1)$ is [[contractible]] as a pointed motivic space. It is common to write, for $p\geq q\geq 0$,

$$ S^{p,q} {:=} S^{p-q}\wedge \mathbb{G}_m^{\wedge q}. $$

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition
There is a canonical equivalence of pointed motivic spaces $T\simeq (\mathbb{P}^1,1)$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The cartesian square

$$
  \array{
    \mathbb{G}_m &\stackrel{}{\to}& \mathbb{A}^1
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbb{A}^1 &\stackrel{}{\to}& \mathbb{P}^1
  }
$$

becomes [[(∞,1)-pushout|homotopy cocartesian]] in the [[Nisnevich site|Nisnevich]] (even [[Zariski site|Zariski]]) (∞,1)-topos. By pointing all schemes at $1$ and using that $(\mathbb{A}^1,1)$ is contractible, we deduce that $(\mathbb{P}^1,1)\simeq S^1\wedge \mathbb{G}_m\simeq T.$
=--


## The stable motivic homotopy category 
 {#StableCategory}

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition
The stable motivic homotopy category $SH(S)$ over $S$ is the [[inverse limit]] of the tower of (∞,1)-categories

$$ \dots \stackrel{\Omega_T}{\to} \mathrm{H}_*(S) \stackrel{\Omega_T}{\to} \mathrm{H}_*(S) \stackrel{\Omega_T}{\to} \mathrm{H}_*(S),$$

where $\Omega_T {:=}Hom(T, -)$. An object of the stable motivic homotopy category is called a _motivic spectrum_ (or _$T$-spectrum_).
=--

Thus, a motivic spectrum $E$ is a sequence of pointed motivic spaces $(E_0,E_1,E_2\dots)$ together with equivalences

$$ \Omega_T E_{i+1}\simeq E_i. $$

Since $T\simeq \mathbb{P}^1$, we could equivalently use $\mathbb{P}^1$ instead of $T$ in the above definition.

Since $T\simeq S^1\wedge \mathbb{G}_m$, $SH(S)$ is indeed a [[stable (∞,1)-category]].

### Symmetric monoidal structure and universal property

The functor $\Omega^\infty_T\colon SH(S)\to \mathrm{H}_*(S)$ sending a motivic spectrum $E$ to its first component $E_0$ admits a [[left adjoint]] $\Sigma_T^\infty$. One can then equip the category $SH(S)$ with the structure of a [[symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category]] in such a way that the (∞,1)-functor $\Sigma_T^\infty$ can be promoted to a symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-functor. As such, $SH(S)$ is characterized by a [[universal property]]:

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[locally presentable (∞,1)-category|locally presentable]] [[symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category|symmetric monoidal]] [[(∞,1)-category]].
The (∞,1)-functor

$$ Fun^{\otimes, L}(SH(S),\mathcal{C}) \to Fun^{\otimes} (Sm/S, \mathcal{C}), \quad F\mapsto F\circ \Sigma_T^\infty(-)_+ $$

(where $\otimes$ means "symmetric monoidal" and $L$ means "colimit-preserving")
is [[fully faithful]] and its essential image consists of the symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-functors $F\colon Sm/S\to \mathcal{C}$ satisfying:

* [[Nisnevich site|Nisnevich excision]]
* $\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy invariance
* _$T$-stability_: the [[homotopy cofiber]] of $F(\mathbb{G}_m)\to F(\mathbb{A}^1)$ is $\otimes$-invertible.

=--

This is ([Robalo, Corollary 5.11](#Robalo)).

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Similar characterizations exist for [[noncommutative motives]], see at _[Noncommutative motive -- As the universal additive invariant](noncommutative+motive#AsUniversalAditiveInvariant)_.

=--


### Stable motivic spheres {#StableMotivicSpheres}

Because $T\simeq S^{2,1}$, the stable motivic spheres $S^{p,q}$ are defined for all $p,q\in\mathbb{Z}$.

All the other motivic spheres $S^V$, for $V$ a vector bundle on $S$, also become invertible in $SH(S)$. In fact, the [[Picard ∞-groupoid]] of $SH(S)$ receives a map from the [[algebraic K-theory]] of $S$. These invertible objects are all *exotic* in the sense that they are not equivalent to any of the categorical [[sphere]]s $S^n$ which exist in any [[stable (∞,1)-category]]. These exotic spheres play an important rôle in the formalism of [[six operations]] in stable motivic homotopy theory (see [Ayoub](#Ayoub)).

### Cohomology theories {#CohomologyTheories}

Any motivic spectrum $E\in SH(S)$ gives rise to a bigraded [[cohomology|cohomology theory]] for smooth $S$-schemes and more generally for motivic spaces:

$$ E^{p,q}(X) {:=} [\Sigma^\infty_T X_+, \Sigma^{p,q} E], $$

as well as a bigraded homology theory:

$$ E_{p,q}(X) {:=} [S^{p,q}, \Sigma^\infty_T X_+ \wedge E]. $$


## Main features


### The six operations {#SixOperations}

The categories $SH(S)$ for varying base scheme $S$ support a formalism of [[six operations]]. This means that to every morphism of schemes $f: X\to Y$ is associated an ([[inverse image]] $\dashv$ [[direct image]])-[[adjunction]]

$$ f^* : SH(Y) \to SH(X) : f_* $$

and, if $f$ is [[separated morphism|separated]] of finite type, a ([[direct image with compact support]] $\dashv$ [[exceptional inverse image]])-adjunction

$$ f_! : SH(X) \to SH(Y): f^!,$$

satisfying the properties listed at [[six operations]]. For more details see [Ayoub](#Ayoub).

**Stable homotopy functors.** To construct the six operations for $SH$, Voevodsky introduced an axiomatic setting which also subsumes the classical case of [[étale cohomology]]. A _stable homotopy functor_ is a contravariant (∞,1)-functor

$$ D\colon Schemes^{op} \to PrStab (\infty,1) Cat, $$

from some category of schemes to the (∞,1)-category $PrStab (\infty,1) Cat$ of [[locally presentable (∞,1)-category|locally presentable]] [[stable (∞,1)-categories]] and colimit-preserving exact functors, satisfying the following axioms (for $f$ a morphism of schemes, we denote $D(f)$ by $f^*$ and its right adjoint by $f_*$):

1. $D(\emptyset)=0$.

2. If $i: X\to Y$ is an immersion of schemes, then $i_*\colon D(X)\to D(Y)$ is [[fully faithful (∞,1)-functor|fully faithful]].

3. (Smooth base change/[[Beck-Chevalley condition]]) If $f$ is [[smooth scheme|smooth]], then $f^*$ admits a left adjoint $f_\sharp$. Moreover, given a cartesian square
$$
  \array{
    Y' &\stackrel{k}{\to}& X'
    \\
    _h\downarrow && \downarrow \;_f
    \\
    Y &\stackrel{g}{\to}& X
  }
$$
with $f$ smooth, there is a canonical equivalence $h_\sharp k^*\simeq g^* f_\sharp$.

4. (Locality) If $i: Z\hookrightarrow X$ is a [[closed immersion]] with open complement $j: U\hookrightarrow X$, then the pair $(i^*,j^*)$ is [[conservative functor|conservative]].

5. (Homotopy invariance) If $p: X\times\mathbb{A}^1\to X$ is the projection, then $p^*$ is [[fully faithful (∞,1)-functor|fully faithful]].

6. ($T$-stability) If $p$ is as above and $s$ is the zero section of $p$, then $p_\sharp s_*: D(X)\to D(X)$ is an [[equivalence of (∞,1)-categories]].

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem
(Ayoub, Voevodsky) Every stable homotopy functor admits a formalism of four operations $f^\ast$, $f_\ast$, $f_!$, and $f^!$.
=--

For a more precise statement, see [Ayoub, Scholie 1.4.2](#Ayoub).

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem
$SH$ is a stable homotopy functor.
=--

This is essentially proved in [Morel-Voevodsky](#MorelVoevodsky). In fact, something stronger is expected to be true:

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Expected Theorem
$SH$ is the [[initial object]] in the [[(∞,2)-category]] of stable homotopy functors.
=--

This theorem has not been proved yet; however, [Ayoub's thesis](#Ayoub) shows that every stable homotopy functor factors through $SH$.


### Realization functors {#RealizationFunctors}

**Complex realization.** The functor

$$ Sm/\mathbb{C}\to SmoothMfd,\quad X\mapsto X(\mathbb{C}) $$

associating to a smooth $\mathbb{C}$-scheme $X$ its set of $\mathbb{C}$-points with its structure of [[smooth manifold]] induces a functor from $\mathrm{H}(\mathbb{C})$ to the [[homotopy localization]] of the [[smooth ∞-groupoid|smooth (∞,1)-topos]] at the [[interval object]] $\mathbb{A}^1(\mathbb{C})\simeq \mathbb{R}^2$. As this localization is equivalent to the [[(∞,1)-topos]] $\infty Grpd$ of [[discrete ∞-groupoid]]s, we obtain the _complex realization functor_

$$ \mathrm{H}(\mathbb{C}) \to \infty Grpd. $$

After $T$-stabilization, we obtain a functor from $SH(\mathbb{C})$ to the [[(∞,1)-category of spectra]].

**Real realization.** The functor

$$ Sm/\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{Z}/2-SmoothMfd,\quad X\mapsto X(\mathbb{C}) $$

associating to a smooth $\mathbb{R}$-scheme $X$ its set of $\mathbb{C}$-points with its structure of [[smooth manifold]] together with the action of $\mathbb{Z}/2$ by [[complex conjugation]] induces as in the complex case the _Real realization functor_

$$ \mathrm{H}(\mathbb{R}) \to \infty Grpd/ \mathbf{B}(\mathbb{Z}/2). $$

After $T$-stabilization, we obtain a functor from $SH(\mathbb{R})$ to the (∞,1)-category of [[equivariant stable homotopy theory|genuine]] $\mathbb{Z}/2$-spectra.

**Étale realization.** Over a separably closed field $k$, we can consider the [[étale homotopy|étale homotopy type]] functor

$$ Sh_{\infty}((Sm/k)_{Nis})\to Sh_{\infty}((Sm/k)_{et}) \stackrel{\Pi}{\to} Pro(\infty Grpd) $$

(see [[shape of an (∞,1)-topos]]). However, it does not descend to $\mathrm{H}(k)$ because the étale homotopy type is not $\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy invariant. To rectify this, we choose a prime $l\neq \operatorname{char}(k)$ and consider the reflexive [[localization]] $Pro(\infty Grpd)^\wedge_{l}$ of $Pro(\infty Grpd)$ at the class of maps inducing isomorphisms on pro-homology groups with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}/l$. We then obtain an _étale realization functor_

$$ \mathrm{H}(k) \to Pro(\infty Grpd)^\wedge_{l}. $$

For a non-separably closed field $k$, there is a $Gal(k^{sep}/k)$-equivariant realization analogous to the Real realization.


### The slice filtration {#SliceFiltration}

The slice filtration is a filtration of $\mathrm{H}(S)$ and of $SH(S)$ which is analogous to the [[Postnikov tower in an (∞,1)-category|Postnikov filtration]] for [[(∞,1)-topoi]]. It generalizes the _coniveau filtration_ in [[algebraic K-theory]], the _fundamental filtration_ on [[Witt groups]], and the _weight filtration_ on [[mixed motives]].

In $SH(S)$, the layers of the slice filtrations (called the _slices_) are modules over the [motivic Eilenberg–Mac Lane spectrum](#MotivicCohomology) $H(\mathbb{Z})$. At least if $S$ is a [[field]] of characteristic zero, this is the same thing as an integral [[motive]]. The [[spectral sequences]] associated to the slice filtration are analogous to the [[Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence]]s in that their first page consists of [[motivic cohomology]] groups.

### The $\mathbb{A}^1$-Postnikov filtration
{#A1PostnikovFiltration}

One can also consider the filtration on $\mathrm{H}(S)$ induced by the [[Postnikov tower in an (∞,1)-category|Postnikov filtration]] in the containing [[Nisnevich (∞,1)-topos]]. A motivic space is _$\mathbb{A}^1$-$n$-connected_ if it is $n$-connected as a Nisnevich (∞,1)-sheaf, and the _$\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy groups_ $\pi_n^{\mathbb{A}^1}(X)$ and _$\mathbb{A}^1$-homology groups_ $H_n^{\mathbb{A}^1}(X)$ of a motivic space are its [[homotopy groups in an (∞,1)-topos|homotopy groups]] and [[homology groups]] as a Nisnevich (∞,1)-sheaf. 

Intuitively, $\mathbb{A}^1$-connectedness corresponds to the topological connectedness of the _real points_ rather than of the complex points. For example, $\mathbb{G}_m$ is not $\mathbb{A}^1$-connected, and $\mathbb{P}^1$ is $\mathbb{A}^1$-connected but not $\mathbb{A}^1$-simply connected.

There is a corresponding [[t-structure]] on the stable (∞,1)-category $SH(S)$ called the _homotopy t-structure_.


### Relation to the theory of motives

The stable motivic homotopy category $SH(S)$ is the basis for several definitions of the [[motive|derived category of mixed motives]] over $S$. See there for more details.

### Relation to the theory of symmetric bilinear forms

Motivic homotopy theory is also related to the classical theory of symmetric [[bilinear forms]] (or [[quadratic forms]] in characteristic $\neq 2$). Invariants such as [[Witt groups]], oriented [[Chow groups]], and Hermitian [[K-theory]] are representable in the motivic homotopy category.

A central theorem of [[Fabien Morel]] states that, if $k$ is a [[field]], the ring of endomorphisms of the motivic sphere spectrum $S^0\in SH(k)$ is canonically isomorphic to the _Grothendieck–Witt ring_ $GW(k)$: this is the [[group completion]] of the [[semiring]] of isomorphism classes of nondegenerate [[bilinear form|symmetric spaces]] over $k$ ([Morel, Corollary 5.43](#Morel)). The case $k=\mathbb{R}$ is especially enlightening: there the stable homotopy class of a pointed endomorphism of $\mathbb{P}^1$ corresponds to the nondegenerate symmetric space over $\mathbb{R}$ whose dimension is the degree of the induced endomorphism of $\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{C})\simeq S^2$ and whose signature is the degree of the induced endomorphism of $\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{R})\simeq S^1$.


## Applications and examples

### $\mathbb{A}^1$-coverings and the $\mathbb{A}^1$-fundamental group

...

### $\mathbb{A}^1$-h-cobordisms and the classification of surfaces

Asok and Morel used unstable $\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy theory to classify, up to $\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy, all rational smooth proper surfaces over [[algebraically closed field]]s. See [Asok-Morel](#AsokMorel).


### Euler classes and splittings of algebraic vector bundles

...


### Motivic cohomology {#MotivicCohomology}

Suppose that $S$ is a [[smooth scheme]] over a [[field]]. Then the [[motivic cohomology]] of smooth $S$-schemes is representable in $\mathrm{H}(S)$ and in $SH(S)$. If $A$ is an [[abelian group]] and $p\geq q\geq 0$, there exist a pointed motivic spaces $K(A(q),p)$, called a _motivic Eilenberg–MacLane space_, such that, for every $X\in Sm/S$,

$$ H^{p-r,q-s}(X,A) = [\Sigma^{r,s}X_+, K(A(q),p)]. $$

Voevodsky's _cancellation theorem_ implies that $\Omega_T K(A(q+1), p+2)\simeq K(A(q), p)$. It follows that the sequence of motivic spaces $K(A(n),2n)$ form a $T$-spectrum $H(A)$, called a _motivic Eilenberg–MacLane spectrum_, such that

$$ H^{p,q}(X,A) = [\Sigma_T^\infty X_+, \Sigma^{p,q} H(A)]. $$

If $R$ is a [[commutative ring]], the motivic spectrum $H(R)$ has a canonical structure of $E_\infty$-algebra in $SH(S)$ which induces the ring structure in motivic cohomology.

Unlike in topology, $H(\mathbb{Q})$ is not always equivalent to the rational motivic sphere spectrum $S^0_{\mathbb{Q}}$: this is only the case if $-1$ is a sum of squares in the base field. In general, $H(\mathbb{Q})$ is a direct summand of $S^0_{\mathbb{Q}}$.

The stable (∞,1)-category of $H(\mathbb{Q})$-[[modules]] is equivalent to the [[derived category of mixed motives]]. See there for more details.

### Algebraic K-theory

Suppose that $S$ is a [[regular scheme]]. Then there exists a motivic $\mathbb{P}^1$-spectrum $KGL$ with the property that, for every $X\in Sm/S$,

$$ KGL^{p,q}(X) = K_{2q-p}(X), $$

where $K_*(X)$ are the [[algebraic K-theory]] groups of $X$ defined by [[Daniel Quillen|Quillen]]. In particular, $KGL$-cohomology is $(2,1)$-periodic: this is _Bott periodicity_ for algebraic K-theory.

The multiplicative structure of algebaric K-theory makes $KGL$ into a ring spectrum (up to homotopy), which comes from a unique structure of $E_\infty$-algebra (see [Naumann-Spitzweck-Ostvaer](#NSO11)).

Over non-regular schemes, the motivic spectrum $KGL$ is also defined and it represents Weibel's homotopy invariant version of [[algebraic K-theory]] (see [Cisinski13](#Cis13)).

### Algebraic cobordism

In analogy with the complex cobordism spectrum $MU$, Voevodsky defined the _[[algebraic cobordism]] spectrum_ $MGL \in SH(S)$ by

$$ MGL = colim_{n\to\infty} \Sigma_T^{\infty -n} V_n/V_n^\times, $$

where $V_n$ is the tautological vector bundle over the infinite Grassmannian of $n$-planes $Gr(n)$. More precisely, $Gr(n)$ is defined as the colimit in $\mathrm{H}(S)$ of the smooth $S$-schemes $Gr(n,k)$ as $k\to\infty$, and $V_n$ is similarly the colimit of the tautological vector bundles over $Gr(n,k)$.

Like $H(\mathbb{Z})$ and $KGL$, $MGL$ is an $E_\infty$ motivic ring spectrum

The spectrum $MGL$ was used by Voevodsky in his proof of the [[Bloch-Kato conjecture]]. It is also the starting point of [[chromatic motivic homotopy theory]].
