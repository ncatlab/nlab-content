## Idea

The $\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy category is an analog of the ordinary [[homotopy category]] $Ho(Top)$ of the [[category]] [[Top]] with [[topological space]]s replaced by [[∞-stack]]s over certain [[scheme]]s.

It is a special case of the [[homotopy theory]] induced form any sufficiently well-behaved [[interval object]] $I$ in a [[site]] $C$ on the [[∞-stack]]s on $C$, for the case that $C$ is the category of [[smooth scheme]]s over a [[Noetherian scheme]] and 

$$
  I = \mathbb{A}^1
$$

is the standard [[affine line]] in $C$.

## Examples and applications

* One example of $\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy theory appears in [[motivic cohomology]]. See there for more details.

* $\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy theory sheds light on (and was at least partially motivated by) the proof of the [[Bloch-Kato conjecture]]. 

* There is an analog of $\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy theory for other geometries. The extra left adjoint on an [[cohesive (infinity,1)-topos]] may realize the localization at an abstract [[continuum]] [[line object]]. See at _[[cohesion]]_ for more details.
