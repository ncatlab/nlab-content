[[!redirects Artin-Mazur  codiagonal ]]

The Artin-Mazur codiagonal of a bisimplicial set is another name often given to the _[[total simplicial set]]_ of a bisimplicial set, and more discussion of it is found at [[bisimplicial set]].

(We will tend not to use this term because of possible confusion with other uses of [[codiagonal]].)
