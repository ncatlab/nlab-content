## Idea 

In classical mathematics, a _countable_ ordinal is a well-ordered set whose cardinality is countable (i.e., either finite or denumerable). 

Countable ordinals play an important role in recursion theory, computability theory, and in proof theory, where they are used for example to measure the consistency strength of formal theories. They also play a role in philosophy of mathematics, for example as a focus of what it means for a notion to be "predicative". 

## Definitions 

As indicated above, countable ordinals can be defined structurally as countable well-ordered sets ([[wosets]] for short). As is the case with any ordered set, a woset $W$ can be regarded as a coalgebra over the covariant power-set functor, 

$$\theta: W \to P(W)$$ 

$$\,$$ 

$$x \mapsto \{y: y \lt x\}.$$ 

A morphism $f: W \to W'$ is usually taken to be a coalgebra map, also called a [[simulation]]. For wosets, morphisms amount to inclusions of the domain as the initial segment of the codomain. 

The category of countable wosets, thus ordered by inclusion, is a preorder and in fact equivalent to a woset. In ZFC, it's equivalent to the first uncountable ordinal (as a well-ordered set under the membership relation), usually denoted $\omega_1$. Generally, we can define $\omega_1$ up to isomorphism as a skeleton of the category of countable ordinals, and thus the study of countable ordinals becomes a study of the order structure of $\omega_1$.

###### Remarks 
Much of the interest (and fun) of the subject lies in the contemplation and description of large elements of $\omega_1$, where "large" means large in a kind of phenomenological sense of what humans can visualize or conceive or define. It is a truism that all so-called "large countable ordinals" are pathetically puny relative to $\omega_1$ itself, but somehow that misses the point, or is true only in the same uninteresting way that all sets, even uncountable sets like $\omega_1$, are puny relative to the ambient universe of sets $V$. Indeed, the key is that $\omega_1$ is _countably cocomplete_ and therefore behaves like a self-contained universe with respect to countably cocontinuous operations, and there is quite a lot of recursive scope in what one can build up to with them (while "never getting anywhere", so to speak, relative to the awe-inducing and shattering immensity of $\omega_1$). 

Anyone who is unimpressed by the size of large countable ordinals probably has never played around with them before. For that matter, people who are unimpressed by large _finite_ numbers has probably never played around with them either, or at least not all that imaginatively! (And interestingly, one can use large countable ordinals reflectively to construct enormous integers, or one can use large uncountable ordinals reflectively to construct enormous countable ordinals.)

## Fixed points and the Feferman-Sch&uuml;tte ordinal 

Here we discuss the use of fixed point theory in describing the lower stages of the Veblen hierarchy of countable ordinals, on up to the Feferman-Sch&uuml;tte ordinal. At this pass, we freely allow ourselves to use the principle of excluded middle.

###### Proposition 
Suppose $f: \omega_1 \to \omega_1$ is order-preserving, inflationary, and preserves countable colimits. Then every $x \in \omega_1$ has an upper bound that is a fixed point under $f$. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
For any $x$, the colimit $x'$ of $x \leq f(x) \leq f^2(x) \leq \ldots$ exists, and since $f$ preserves countable colimits, $x'$ is a fixed point of $f$.

+-- {: .num_prop} 
###### Proposition 
Suppose $f: \omega_1 \to \omega_1$ is order-preserving, inflationary, and preserves the bottom element $0$ and countable colimits. Define $f': \omega_1 \to \omega_1$ to be the function taking $0$ to $0$ and, for $x \gt 0$, takes $x$ to the least fixed point of $f$ that is greater than $f'(y)$ for all $y \lt x$. Then $f'$ is also order-preserving, inflationary, and preserves bottom and countable colimits. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
$f'$ preserves bottom by definition. At limit ordinals $\beta$, we define $f'(\beta)$ to be the colimit of $f'(\alpha)$ for $\alpha \lt \beta$, and $f'(\alpha + 1)$ is the least fixed point of $f$ that is an upper bound for $f'(\alpha) + 1$. It is a trivial induction that $f'$ is order-preserving and inflationary. If $x_1 \leq x_2 \leq \ldots$ is a countable sequence, then WLOG we may replace this by its image where all inequalities are strict, and suppose this is another countable sequence. It will be cofinal in an initial segment whose least upper bound is a limit ordinal $\beta$, and then it is clear from definition of $f'(\beta)$ that $f'$ preserves the colimit of this sequence. 
=-- 

Indeed, what the preceding proof shows is that if $f: \omega_1 \to \omega_1$ is an order-preserving function such that $f(\beta)$ at a limit ordinal $\beta$ is the supremum of $f(\alpha)$ over $\alpha \lt \beta$, then $f$ preserves countable colimits.

###### Definition 
We introduce a family of functions $f_\alpha: \omega_1 \to \omega_1$, one for each $\alpha \in \omega_1$, as follows. 

* Define $f_0: \omega_1 \to \omega_1$ by $f_0(x) = \sup \{y+2: y \lt x\}$. 

This function preserves bottom, is order-preserving and inflationary, and preserves countable colimits by the preceding remark. 

* Then define $f_\alpha: \omega_1 \to \omega_1$ by $f_{\alpha + 1} = f_\alpha^'$ and $f_\beta = \sup_{\alpha \lt \beta} f_\alpha$ at limit ordinals $\beta$. 

It is immediate, for every $\alpha \lt \omega_1$, that $f_\alpha$ preserves bottom, is order-preserving and inflationary, and preserves countable colimits. 
=-- 

It is worth contemplating the growth of the first few $f_\alpha$. For $f_0$, we have $f_0(\alpha) = \alpha + 1$ if $\alpha$ is a successor, and $f_0(\alpha) = \alpha$ if $\alpha$ is a limit ordinal. 

This means that next we have $f_1(0) = 0$, $f_1(1) = \omega$, $f_1(2) = 2 \omega$, ..., $f_1(\omega) = \omega^2$, and so on. The first fixed point past $0$ is at $x = \omega^\omega$. 

Next, we have $f_2(0) = 0$, $f_2(1) = \omega^\omega$, $f_2(2) = \omega^{2\omega}$, ..., $f_2(\omega) = \omega^{\omega^2}$, and so on. The first fixed point past $0$ is the same as the first fixed point of $x \mapsto \omega^x$ (a countably iterated exponential stack), typically denoted as $\epsilon_0$. 

Hence $f_3(0)= 0$, $f_3(1) = \epsilon_0$, $f_3(2) = \epsilon_1$ (the first fixed point of $x \mapsto \omega^x$ past $\epsilon_0$), and so on. 

These functions provide a binary tree scheme for notating some of the lower levels of the large countable ordinal hierarchy, related to Cantor normal forms. Before introducing this, we prove the following lemmas.

###### Lemma 
If $\alpha \lt \beta$, then every value $f_\beta(x)$ is a fixed point of $f_\alpha$. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
This is clear if $\alpha + 1 = \beta$. Suppose $f_\gamma(x)$ is a fixed point of $f_\alpha$ whenever $\alpha \lt \gamma \lt \beta$. If $\beta$ is a successor $\gamma + 1$, then we have 

$$f_\beta(x) = f_\gamma(f_\beta(x)) = f_\alpha(f_\gamma(f_\beta(x))) = f_\alpha(f_\beta(x)),$$ 

and if $\beta$ is a limit, then 

$$f_\alpha(f_\beta(x)) = f_\alpha(\sup_{\gamma \lt \beta} f_\gamma(x)) = \sup_{\gamma \lt \beta} f_\alpha(f_\gamma(x)) = \sup_{\gamma \lt \beta} f_\gamma(x) = f_\beta(x)$$ 

which completes the proof.

###### Lemma 
For all $y \in \omega_1$, we have $y \leq f_y(1)$. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
By induction. Suppose $\alpha \leq f_\alpha(1)$ for all $\alpha \lt \beta$. Since $1 \leq f_\beta(1)$, we have 

$$\alpha \leq f_\alpha(1) \leq f_\alpha(f_\beta(1)) = f_\beta(1)$$ 

since $f_\beta(1)$ is by definition a fixed point of $f_\alpha$. Since $f_\beta(1)$ is both a limit ordinal and an upper bound for every $\alpha \lt \beta$, it follows that $\beta \leq f_\beta(1)$. 
=-- 

On the other hand, there _is_ a least fixed point of $x \mapsto f_x(1)$. This is the **Feferman-Sch&uuml;tte ordinal**, denoted by $\Gamma_0$. 

+-- {: .num_theorem} 
###### Theorem 
If $\alpha \gt 0$ is less than $\Gamma_0$, then there exists $\beta, \gamma$, both less than $\alpha$, such that $\alpha = f_\beta(\gamma)$. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
If $\alpha$ is not a limit ordinal, then $\alpha = \gamma + 1$ and hence $\alpha = f_0(\gamma)$. Obviously $\alpha$ cannot be a value of $f_\beta$ for $\beta \gt 0$, since all such values are limit ordinals. 

If $\alpha$ is a limit ordinal and $\alpha \lt \Gamma_0$, then there is some $\beta \lt \alpha$ for which $\alpha$ is _not_ a fixed point of $f_\beta$. Otherwise we would have $f_\beta(\alpha) = \alpha$ for all $\beta \lt \alpha$, and this would force $f_\alpha(\alpha) = \alpha$ (by definition of $f_\alpha$). And in that case 

$$\alpha \leq f_\alpha(1) \leq f_\alpha(\alpha) = \alpha$$ 

so that $\alpha$ is a fixed point of $x \mapsto f_x(1)$, contradicting $\alpha \lt \Gamma_0$. 

Thus, for $\alpha$ a limit ordinal, take $\beta$ to be the least ordinal such that $\alpha \lt f_\beta(\alpha)$. Note that $\beta$ is a successor, $\beta = \beta' + 1$, because we have $\alpha = f_\gamma(\alpha)$ for any $\gamma \lt \beta$, and this would imply $\alpha = f_\beta(\alpha)$ if $\beta$ were a limit. 

We have $\alpha \leq f_\beta(\gamma)$ for some $\gamma \lt \alpha$ (for if $f_\beta(\gamma) \lt \alpha$ for all $\gamma \lt \alpha$, we could infer $\alpha$ is a fixed point of $f_\beta$). Let $\gamma$ be the least ordinal (less than $\alpha$) such that $\alpha \leq f_\beta(\gamma)$. Then in fact this last inequality is an equality. For suppose $\gamma = \delta + 1$; then by definition of $\gamma$, we have 

$$f_\beta(\delta) = f_{\beta' + 1}(\delta) \lt \alpha$$ 

and we also have that $\alpha = f_{\beta'}(\alpha)$ by definition of $\beta$. Since $f_\beta(\gamma) = f_{\beta' + 1}(\gamma) = f_{\beta' + 1}(\delta + 1)$ is by definition the least $f_{\beta'}$-fixpoint greater than $f_{\beta' + 1}(\delta)$, we immediately infer $f_\beta(\gamma) \leq \alpha$, as required. If on the other hand $\gamma$ is a limit, we have 

$$f_\beta(\delta) \lt \alpha$$ 

for all $\delta \lt \gamma$, and we again infer $f_{\beta}(\gamma) \leq \alpha$, as required. 
=-- 

This theorem gives a canonical binary tree representation of any $\alpha \lt \Gamma_0$, by recursion. Given that every $\beta$ less than $\alpha$ has been assigned a binary tree $\tau(\beta)$, we define $\tau(\alpha) = (\tau(\beta), \tau(\gamma))$ where 

* $\beta$ is the least ordinal less than $\alpha$ such that $\alpha \lt f_\beta(\alpha)$, and 

* $\gamma$ is the least ordinal less than $\alpha$ such that $\alpha \leq f_\beta(\gamma)$. 

This is an extrapolation of the Cantor normal form that reaches far beyond $\epsilon_0$.
