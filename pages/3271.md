**Victor Ginzburg** (in some 1980-s articles spelled Ginsburg) is a professor of mathematics at the University of Chicago. His thesis in Moscow was under [[Alexandre Kirillov]]. His main interests are [[representation theory]], especially [[geometric representation theory]], including more recently [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]]. 

Warning: there is another mathematician (global analysis, [[symplectic geometry]]), **Viktor** Ginzburg (note the English spelling).
