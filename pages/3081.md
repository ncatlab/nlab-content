__Sibe Mardešić__ is a Croatian [[topology|topologist]], retired Professor at the University of Zagreb and a full member of Croatian Academy of Arts and Sciences (HAZU). His son Pavao Mardešić is also a mathematician, a specialist in the theory of (low dimensional) dynamical systems.

Most of Sibe Mardešić's important works are related to [[shape theory]] and geometric topology, mainly in the approach via inverse systems, which he pioneered (there was also a parallel development by [[Tim Porter]]). Sibe Mardešić wrote several monographs and edited several proceedings volumes in geometric topology and shape theory.
