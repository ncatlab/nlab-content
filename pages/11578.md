
The title refers to a document 'La Longue Marche &#224; travers la Th&#233;orie de Galois" by [[Alexander Grothendieck]]. He wrote the 'Long March' between January and June 1981. It consists of about 1600 manuscript pages, and nearly as much again in various addenda and developments. The central objects considered in the
_Long March_ are the moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces of genus $g$ with $n$
marked points.


(For the moment, this entry is a 'stub' and the topic  is discussed in a bit more detail in a subentry to [[Galois theory]], although that directs here!)
