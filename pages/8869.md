Bargmann-Segal transform is the integral transform whose kernel is the overlap between the projective measure corresponding to the coherent states and 
a measure corresponding to an orthonormal basis comeing from some polarization for $L^2$-sections. The kernel is a special case of a 
[[Bergman kernel]] in complex analysis. 

Classical case of Heisenberg group:

Vectors in the Hilbert space can be represented in the coherent state representation: $|f\rangle = \int |z\rangle\langle z|f\rangle d\mu$; if $f$ is in $L^2$ then $\langle z|f\rangle$ is a holomorphic function and this passage is called the Bargmann-Segal transform (referring to [Irving Segal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_Segal)); this way certain Hilbert space of holomorphic function appears, the Bargmann-Fock space.

Further generalization is to Perelomov coherent states.
