I am a mathematical physicist/mathematician from Zagreb. My Ph.D. is from University of Wisconsin-Madison, 2002. My thesis title was Coset spaces for quantum groups. Here is an <a href="http://www.irb.hr/korisnici/zskoda/abs1">abstract</a>. My mathematical interests include
geometric aspects of mathematical physics (TQFT, geometric
quantization, coherent states etc.),
noncommutative algebraic geometry and noncommutative localization, Hopf algebras, categories, cohomology, 
in particular nonabelian cohomology/descent theory. 

My other scientific interests include historical linguistics (general principles and Indo-European), interface between language and computation (computational linguistics, construction of compilers and computer language design), and medical herbs (herbal tea) but all these past hobbies are latent now for a long time. My native tongue is the 
kajkavian dialect of Croatian. In Croatian we use diacritics for the sch-sound: Škoda.
