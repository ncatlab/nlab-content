## Idea

In modern [[logic]], we understand that every [[variable]] should have a _type_, or _domain of discourse_.  Untyped logic may be seen as simply a special case, in which there is only a single unique type.  (Thus, untyped logic has *one* type, not *no* type.)

It is possible to build [[foundations]] of mathematics on [[type theory]] alone.

## Definition

Reasoning with types is formalized in [[natural deduction]] (which in turn is formalized in a [[logical framework]] such as [[Elf]]).

Behaviour of types is specified by a 4-step set of rules

1. [[type formation]]

1. [[term introduction]]

1. [[term elimination]]

1. [[computation rules]]
