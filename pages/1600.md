Orbispaces are to [[topological space]]s what [[orbifold]]s are to [[manifold]]s. An orbispace is a topological generalization of an orbifold, a class of [[topological stack]]s with locally finite stabilizers. A detailed but elementary approach via atlases can be found in 

* Weimin Chen, A homotopy theory of orbispaces ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0102020))

and another approach is sketched in 

* Andr&eacute; Henriques, Orbispaces and orbifolds from the point of view of the Borel construction, a new definition ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0112006))
