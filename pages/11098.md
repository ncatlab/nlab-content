## Idea

The concept of _coherent $(\infty,1)$-topos_ is a notion of _[[compact topos]]_ in the context of [[(∞,1)-topos theory]] ([[Spectral Schemes|Lurie VII, def. 3.1]]).

## Definitions

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition
An (∞,1)-topos $\mathbf{H}$ is called **[[quasicompact morphism|quasi-compact]]** if, for every [[effective epimorphism]]

$$ \coprod_{i\in I} U_i\to * $$

there exists a [[finite set|finite]] [[subset]] $J\subset I$ such that $\coprod_{i\in J} U_i\to *$ is an effective epimorphism. An object $X\in\mathbf{H}$ is called quasi-compact if the [[slice (∞,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}_{/X}$ is quasi-compact.
=--

We then define $n$-coherence by [[induction]] on $n$.

###### Definition
Let $\mathbf{H}$ be an [[(∞,1)-topos]]. We say that $\mathbf{H}$ is 0-coherent if it is quasi-compact. If $n\geq 1$, we say that $\mathbf{H}$ is **n-coherent** if

1. it is **locally $(n-1)$-coherent**, i.e., for every $X\in\mathbf{H}$ there exists an effective epimorphism $\coprod_{i\in I} U_i\to X$ such that each $U_i$ is (n-1)-coherent;
2. the [[sub-(∞,1)-category]] of (n-1)-coherent objects in $\mathbf{H}$ is closed under [[finite products]].

We say that $\mathbf{H}$ is **coherent** if it is $n$-coherent for every $n\geq 0$, and **locally coherent** if for every $X\in\mathbf{H}$ there exists an effective epimorphism $\coprod_{i\in I} U_i\to X$ such that each $U_i$ is coherent.

###### Remark
This terminology differs from the one in [[SGA]]4: a topos is coherent in the sense of [[SGA]]4 if and only if it is 1-coherent *and* locally 1-coherent according to the above definition.

## Properties


### Commutativity with filtered colimits

Notice that a [[compact object in an (∞,1)-category]] is one that distributes over [[filtered (∞,1)-colimits]].

In an $n$-coherent $\infty$-topos the [[global section geometric morphism]] (given by homming out of the [[terminal object]]) preserves [[filtered (∞,1)-colimits]] of [[truncated object in an (infinity,1)-topos|(n-1)-truncated objects]].

### In terms of sites

An [[(∞,1)-site]] is *finitary* if every [[covering]] [[sieve]] is generated by a finite family of morphisms. If $C$ is a finitary (∞,1)-site with [[finite (∞,1)-limits]], then the [[(∞,1)-topos of (∞,1)-sheaves]] on $C$ is coherent and locally coherent.

## Example

Let $X$ be a [[scheme]] and let $Sh_\infty(X_{Zar})$ be the (∞,1)-topos of sheaves on the small [[Zariski site]] of $X$. Then the following assertions are equivalent:

1. $Sh_\infty(X_{Zar})$ is coherent;
2. $Sh_\infty(X_{Zar})$ is 1-coherent;
3. $X$ is quasi-compact and quasi-separated.
