Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of [[scheme]]s. Let $\Delta_f: X \to X \times_Y X$ be the diagonal map. We say that $f$ is __quasi-separated__ if $\Delta_f$ is a [[quasicompact morphism]]. Every separated morphism is quasi-separated; every monomorphism of schemes is separated hence also quasi-separated. 

A scheme is quasi-separated if it is quasi-separated over $Spec\, \mathbb{Z}$.
