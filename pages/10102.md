## Idea

The generalization of the process of [[one-point compactification]] of possibly non-[[compact topological space|compact]] [[topological spaces]] from [[topology]] to [[non-commutative topology]] is the process of adding units to possibly non-unital [[C*-algebras]], thought of as formal duals of non-commutative spaces in [[noncommutative topology]].

## Definition

For $(A, {\Vert -\Vert_A})$ a not necessarily unital [[C*-algebra]], its **unitisation** is the $C^\ast$-algebra whose underlying Banach space is the [[direct sum]] 

$$
  A^+ \coloneqq A \oplus \mathbb{C}
$$ 

with the [[complex numbers]] equipped with the evident multiplication 

$$
  (a_1 + z_1) \cdot (a_2 + z_2) \coloneqq (a_1 a_2 + a_1 z_2 + z_1 a_2) + z_1 z_2
$$

the evident [[involution]]

$$
  (a + z)^\ast \coloneqq a^\ast + \overline{z}
$$

([[complex conjugation]] on the right) and with [[norm]] given by

$$
  {\Vert a + z\Vert}_{A^+} \coloneqq {\Vert a+ z\Vert}_{\mathcal{B}(A)}
  \,.
$$

## Properties

### The point at infinity

The unitisation of $A$ comes with a canonical [[projection]] [[homomorphism]] of [[C*-algebras]]

$$
  i^\ast_A \colon A^+ \to \mathbb{C}
$$

given by

$$
 (a + z) \mapsto z
  \,.
$$

Dually this corresponds to the inclusion of the "point at infinity".

### K-theory with compact support on non-unital $C^\ast$-algebras

The map $i^\ast_A \colon A^+ \to \mathbb{C}$ induces a morphism in [[operator K-theory]]

$$
  K(i^\ast_A) \colon K(A^+) \to K(\mathbb{C}) \simeq \mathbb{Z}
  \,.
$$

The [[kernel]] of this map is the operator K-theory of the original possibly non-unital $C^\ast$-algebra $A$:

$$
  K(A) \coloneqq ker(K(i^\ast_A))
 \,.
$$

Heuristically it is clear that this is the "compactly suppported" K-theory of the possibly non-compact non-commutative space given by the algebra $A$. This statement has been made precise in Heath... where it is shown that for $A = C(X)$ the functions on a topological space, $K(A)$ as above is isomorphic to the subspace of the space of maps $X \to KU$ to the [[K-theory spectrum]] to those that are compactly supported.
