The term _directed graph_ is used in both [[graph theory]] and [[category theory]]. The definition varies -- even within *one* of the two theories.

In [[graph theory]], _directed graph_ (often abbreviated to the contraction _digraph_) nowadays usually means a [[digraph]], while in [[category theory]], directed graph generally means a [[quiver]]. The basic difference is: [[quivers]] may have multiple arrows in the *same* direction (often called "parallel"), and also *loops*, while [[digraphs]] may not have any of those.

## Overview of usual technical terms 


> We see one family, in the same room but hardly together. The family of signed, gain, and biased graphs is a lot like that. The Bibliography and Glossary are supposed to lead the family members to talk to one another. May they do so!  ([Thomas Zaslavsky: front page](#HomePageOfSignedGraphs))

The following table may help distinguish the various terminological conventions in current use: 

| technical term | distinctive feature |  short verbal definition  | [[signature]]; and axioms, of the [[theory]] (in a narrow sense of "theory")| comments |  
|---------------------|-------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
|  directed graph |   n/a (context-dependent umbrella-term)       |  n/a |  n/a | n/a   |  
|  [[quiver]] |     loops allowed, parallel arcs allowed     | presheaf on the walking quiver | [[equality| = ]], two function symbols; more than one axioms (how many is up to interpretation)  |  |
|  [[digraph]] |    no loops, no parallel arcs, but 2-cycles allowed     | binary [[irreflexive relation]]  | [[equality| = ]], one relation symbol; one axiom expressing irreflexivity; if [[constructive logic]] is required, signature might be larger, requiring an [[apartness relation]] expressing irreflexivity    |  |
|  oriented [[graph]] |   looks essentially like oriented one-dimensional [[simplicial complex]]   | undirected simple graph whose edges were replaced by one arrow each | dependent on the chosen formalization of [[graph]]; if [[graph]] is formalized as a [[relation|relation]], and the orientedness by [[antisymmetry]], then the signature is: [[equality| = ]], one relation symbol; and the axioms then are: one axiom expressing irreflexivity, one axiom expressing antisymmetry; if [[constructive logic]] is required, the signature might be larger, requiring an [[apartness relation]] expressing irreflexivity |  |
|  signed [[graph]] | undirected [[graph]] with a sign on each edge    | undirected simple [[graph]] together with a function $\{$edges$\}$ $\rightarrow$ $\{-,+\}$,not subject to any axioms | dependent on the chosen formalization of [[graph|undirected simple graph]]; if [[graph|undirected simple graph]] is formalized in one of the usual ways as a [[relation|symmetric irreflexive relation]], and the signs in the usual way as two [[signature|constant symbols]], then the signature is:  [[equality| = ]], one relation symbol, two constant symbols; and the axioms then are: one axiom expressing irreflexivity, one axiom expressing symmetry; note that no axiom to express distinctness of the two constant symbols is necessary, as this, in the usual approach, is built into the signature; if [[constructive logic]] is required, the signature might be larger, requiring an [[apartness relation]] to express irreflexivity  | beware that this should *not* in a natural way be regarded a "directed graph", though they *are* often used in *contexts* together with directed graphs and thus belong on this page; in a sense, "signed graphs" are a non-example, an *odd-one-out*, in particular in that they seem tricky to categorically construct |
|  bidirected [[graph]] |  [[quiver]] with a sign on each vertex-arrow-*[[incidence|incidence relation]]*   | quiver together with function $\{$vertices$\}$ $\times$ $\{$arrows$\}$ $\rightarrow$ $\{-,+\}$, subject to axioms |   |  |

Note that there are two points of view in model theory: one regards [[equality| = ]] as a [[logic|logical symbol]] of a meta-language (e.g., first-order logic with equality), the other regards  [[equality| = ]] as a binary relation symbol defined within the language under investigation. In the table, as a reminder that equality plays an important role in these theories, the latter view was taken. 

## Table of definitions of directed graphs in various references

This is to give a compressed look-up table, quickly usable, telling you what definition of directed graph is being used in the reference you happen to be working with.



| reference | kind of directed graph emphasized in the reference | formalization used; and exact reference to place in reference  | *word* used in reference | miscellaneous further comments |

|  [BangJensenGutin2nd](#DG2nd) |    [[digraph]]               | the one in [[digraph]], except for a needless assumption of a vertex-set being non-empty: an empty vertex-set implies that the binary relation is the empty relation, but this *is* a [[digraph]] |  *digraph*  | beware that that book sometimes treats [[quivers]], but calls them *directed pseudographs* and formalizes those using [[multisets]] of ordered pairs |
| [BondyMurtyt1st](#BondyMurtyFirstEdition) | [[quiver]] | unusually hybrid functional-relational formalization via *families of ordered pairs* | *digraph*; beware that Bondy-Murty-digraphs are *not* [[digraphs]] | aversion to the void: needless assumption of vertex-sets being non-empty; essentially, Bondy-Murty-digraphs$\simeq$Schrijver-digraphs|
| [ChartrandLesniakZhang6th](#CLZ2016) | [[digraph]] | the one in [[digraph]], except for a needless assumption of a digraph being non-empty set: the empty set *is* a [[digraph]] | *digraph* | beware that what the authors call "The First Theorem of Digraph Theory" is a *not* a theorem of "Digraph Theory" in the strictest technical sense of "Digraph Theory"($=$the first-order theory of irreflexive binary relations) since it *uses the language of arithmetic*|
|  [CsabaEtAl2016](#DecompositionProof) |    [[digraph]]               | the one in [[digraph]] |  *digraph*  | |
|  [DiestelGraphTheory4th](#Diestel2010) |    [[quiver]]               | the usual one: cf. [Section 1.10](#Diestel2010), which is the "nuts-and-bolts-definition" in [[quiver]] | *directed graph*; wisely, the contraction *digraph* is used but once in main text, avoiding a clash with [[digraph]] | beware that *directed path* in the book means something different, type-theoretically at least, from *path in a [[digraph]]*: in the book, a *directed path* is itself a [[digraph]], not a sequence of vertices |
|  [HararyGraphTheory1969](#HararyGraphTheory1969) |   [[digraph]]               | the one in [[digraph]]; cf. [Chapter 16](#HararyGraphTheory1969), provided the word "collection" is read "set", which, as is abundantly clear from the context, is what Harary means; Harary is unambiguous that he does not allow digraphs to have loops; so Harary-digraphs are [[digraphs]] |  *digraph* | Harary uses [p. 199, second paragraph](#HararyGraphTheory1969) the unusual term "semiwalk" what is called "wealk walk" in [[digraph]]; note [p. 198, last paragraph](#HararyGraphTheory1969) that Harary's "path" is (modulo "paths" in [[digraph]] not being digraphs but only vertex-sequences) precisely the usual meaning of "path", although he only mentions that there be no point-repetitions: this evidently implies that there are no arc-repetitions; in summary, Harary-paths are [[digraph|paths]] |
|  [FlajoletSedgewick1st](#AnalyticCombinatorics2009) |   [[binary relation]]               | [[binary relations]], formalized in [[material set theory]]-style, cf. [V.5.1](#AnalyticCombinatorics2009) | both  *digraph* and *directed graph* used interchangeably | beware that Flajolet-Sedgwewick-digraphs are just [[binary relations]], *not* [[digraphs]] |
|  [SchrijverComOpt1st](#Schriver2003) |    [[quiver]]               | unusually hybrid formalization via *families of ordered pairs*; Bondy-Murty formalise Schrijver's *family* using a function called $\psi_D$ | *digraph*; beware that Schrijver-digraphs are *not* [[digraphs]] | no aversion to the void here; moreover, note that SchrijverDigraphs$\simeq$Bondy-Murty-digraphs  |
|  [West2002](#West2002) |    [[quiver]]           | unusually hybrid functional-relational formalization via *families of ordered pairs*: cf. [Definition 1.4.2](#West2002); West is very explicit about allowing both loops and multiple directed edges | *digraph* | beware that, as usual in the combinatorial literature, a "path" in [Definition 1.4.6](#West2002) is *itself* a quiver, i.e. does not carry any parametrization-information, i.e. is not a map like [[paths]] are  |



Note that "kind of directed graph" is a used in a loose, undefined sense, sufficiently clear from the context. 


## Signed graphs

A *signed graph* is a [[simple undirected graph|graph]] *each of whose edges has  been assigned one element of a specified two-element set*. 
The latter's elements are customarily interpreted as "signs", and *sometimes* the sign-set is also equipped with arithmetical structure, though this is *not* part of the definition.  

Signed graphs should *not* be regarded to be *directed graphs*. Signs on undirected edges are not the same as directional information. 
Of course, upon *arbitarily specifying a [[total order]] on the vertex set*, the signs *can* be interpreted to contain directional information, but this extraneous choice of total order is not natural.

Signed graphs (and the basic theorems of their theory) are notorious for being rediscovered over and over again; a critically annotated bibliography on signed graphs and their various guises is [Zaslavsky](#ZaslavskyBibliography).


In a sense, the [[theory]] of signed graphs has a [[[model theory|signature]] which contains at least two [[model theory|constant symbols]], whereas e.g. the theory of undirected simple graphs (in the narrowest sense) has none. 

A *signed graph* should *not* be regarded a "directed graph", though they *are* often used in *contexts* together with directed graphs and thus belong on this page; in a sense, "signed graphs" are a non-example, an odd-one-out, in particular in that they seem tricky to categorically construct.  




## Oriented graphs

An *oriented graph* is a [[simple undirected graph|graph]] *each of whose edges has  been given one of the two orientations*. 
As such, *no* multiplicities whatsoever are possible, not even *directed 2-cycles*($=$antiparallel arcs). 
This is the standard meaning of *oriented graph* in combinatorics, the term generally being perceived to signal that even 2-cycles are forbidden, in contrast to [[digraphs]] which may have them. 
There are several ways to formalize "oriented graph", and here we do not describe any of them. 




## Bidirected graphs

Roughly speaking, bidirected graphs are quivers in which *each non-loop arrow gets decorated with _two_ elements drawn from a two-element set fixed in advanced, one thought to be attached to the arrow's tail, the other to its head*. 
Like for signed graphs, the elements of this two-element set are *sometimes* interpreted to be *signs* and equipped with arithmetical structure (essentially, the two-element set is taken to be a two-element [[group]]). 
 
(The treatment of *loops* is slightly controversial in the combinatorical literature, prompting some ad-hoc-ery, and this is explicitly commented on at least once in the literature.)
The category-theoretic literature seems not to have picked up on this so far, and could clarify the issue. 

Bidirected graphs are important in the theory of [[flows]] on [[graphs]]. 





## Connections to category theory

Herein some evident aspects are pointed out explicitly.

### Underlying quivers

A basic connection is that for any category, its [[forgetful functor|underlying]] [[quiver]] is a directed graph. 

Another aspect is that a *nonempty* [[digraph]] never is isomorphic to the [[quiver]] [[forgetful functor|underlying]] any category: such a quiver *always* has a loop at each vertex, which is already enough to rule out any isomorphism. 


### An application of directed graphs to category theory

Briefly, and from a slightly [[model theory|model theoretical]] point of view, the charm of this application is that [[pasting scheme|A. J. Power's pasting theorem]] is an example of a *transfer* of knowledge from a *theory without [[signature (in logic)|function symbols]]* to a *theory with [[signature (in logic)|function symbols]]*. 
(The theory of [[digraphs]], strictly construed, is *purely relational*, while [[higher category theory]] makes essential use of several [[signature (in logic)|function symbols]]).

An example of a use of digraph theory in category theory is giving a rigorous justification of the  notational practice of [[pasting diagrams]]. 
This was achieved in the late 1980s (cf. e.g. [Johnson 1987](#Johnson1987), [Johnson 1989](#Johnson1989), [Power 1990](#Power1990)). 
In this approach, parallel arcs or loops are of secondary importance, and sometimes expressly forbidden, so the work of Johnson and Power can be seen as a genuine application of graph theory to category theory. 


### *All* quivers deemed irreflexive by Lawvere


There is an article of [[William Lawvere]] which is relevant in one precise respect to a disambiguation page such as the present one: *an unusual use of the adjective "irreflexive"*. 
Therein, one reads (cf. ([Lawvere 1989](#GeneralizedGraphs), page 272)) 

> [..] the elementary "parallel process" $E= \bullet\overset{\rightarrow}{\rightarrow}\bullet$ is a reflexive graph which happens to admit only one definition of composition making it into a category $\mathbf{P}$. [..] Its [[actions]] $S^{\mathbf{P}^{\mathrm{op}}}$ are the **irreflexive** graphs (the negative is in a way appropriate even for those objects which happen to have loops at some point $p$, for morphisms are allowed to interchange *any* two such loops).

With "the negative is in a way appropriate" Lawvere explains the use of the strong negation *irr-*, despite such an "irreflexive graph" being permitted to contain loops at *some* of its vertices, which is obviously different from what one would expect from the usual sense of [[irreflexive relation]]. 
This is a usage in need of explanation, all the more against the backdrop of contemporary teaching where the term "simple undirected graph" is often literally defined as symmetric irreflexive relation (on the vertex set).

Some authors have adopted this interesting variant sense of "irreflexive", prompting an additional use of the a modifier "strict" to form a composite "strict irreflexive graph". (cf. ([Brown et al 2008](#GraphsOfMorphismsOfGraphs)), which uses "digraph" as a synonym for "strict irreflexive graph", and this sense of "digraph" is precisely the one in [[digraph]]). 
In a sense, a [[digraph]] is a "strictly-Lawvere-irreflexive graph".



From a graph-theoretical point of view, every digraph is a quiver, but not every quiver is a digraph (again, in the sense of [Gutin and Bang-Jensen 2009](#DG2nd)).
