#Idea#

A (directed) graph is a collection of edges which may stretch between (ordered) pairs of "points", called _vertices_.

A directed graph is like a [[category]] with units and composition forgotten. Indeed, a [[category]] is a directed graph with extra structure.  To formalize this idea, we say there is a [[forgetful functor]] 

$$U : Cat \to DiGraph$$

where [[DiGraph]] is the category of directed graphs and [[Cat]] is the category of small categories.  Moreover, this forgetful functor has a [[adjoint functor|left adjoint]] 

$$F : DiGraph \to Cat $$

sending each directed graph to the [[free functor|free]] category on that graph.  A free category on a graph is called a [[quiver]].

#Definition#

An **abstract directed graph** $X$ is a [[category]] with

* one object $X_0$, called the object of _vertices_;

* one object $X_1$, called the object of _edges_;

* two morphisms $s,t : X_1 \to X_0$, called
the _source_ and _target_;

* together with identity morphisms.

A **directed graph** is a [[functor]] $G: X\to$ [[Set]].

More generally, a **directed graph [[internalization|in]] a category $C$** is a [[functor]] $G : X \to C$.

The category of directed graphs in $C$, [[DiGraph]], is the [[functor category]] $C^{X}$, where:

* objects are functors $G: X \to C$,

* morphisms are [[natural transformation|natural transformations]] between such functors.

In the basic case $C = Set$, we call this category the category of [[presheaf|presheaves]] on $X^{op}$.  So: the category of directed graphs, [[DiGraph]], is the category of presheaves on the category $X^{op}$.

#Remarks#

Let $G_0 = G(X_0)$ and $G_1 = G(X_1)$.

* A directed graph in $C$ is a [[presheaf]] on $X^{op}$ with values in $C$.

* A directed graph is a [[globular set]] which is concentrated in the first two degrees.

* Directed graphs includes multigraphs, i.e. graphs with distinct edges $e,e'\in G_1$ such that $s(e) = s(e')$ and $t(e) = t(e')$, as well as loops, i.e. edges with $s(e) = t(e)$.

* A directed graph is **complete** if for any pair of vertices $v,v'\in G_0$, there are directed edges $e,e'\in G_1$ with $s(e) = v, t(e) = v'$ and $s(e') = v', t(e') = v$.

#Discussion#

_[[Eric Forgy|Eric]] asks_: Given a small [[category]] $C$ whose set of objects is countable, I'm interested in finding the smallest [[directed graph]] $G$ such that its free category/quiver $F(G)$ is equivalent to $C$. Is that a standard construction? If so, what would it be called? Does that even make any sense?

[[John Baez]]: If I had you a small category $C$, there's usually _no_ directed graph $G$ such that $F(G)$ is equivalent to $C$!  For example: suppose $C$ has one object and two morphisms.  (There are two categories of this sort; pick your favorite.)  Quivers are very special categories.

[[Eric Forgy|Eric]] continues: Here is one idea I had...

Consider the nerve $N(C)$ and set $G_0 = N(C)_0$.

Next, note that each non-degenerate $2$-simplex $\sigma\in N(C)_2$ is bounded by two distinct (non-identity) morphisms $f:x\to y$, $g:y\to z$ and the composite morphism $gf:x\to z$.

The set of directed edges $G_1$ can then be thought of as the subset of $N(C)_1$ consisting of only those morphisms that are not identities and are not composites.

Then, unless I'm mistaken, $C$ can be recovered from $G = (G_0,G_1)$ by

1. Inserting identity morphisms over each node and
1. Inserting composite morphisms into each path of length 2

In the language of [our paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0407005), I would say that $G$ has no loops and no intermediate edges. These kinds of graphs have some nice properties when you put a discrete calculus on them. 

I suspect that given a small (countable) category $C$ the smallest directed graph $G$ that can reproduce it has an interesting discrete calculus that should have something interesting to say about $C$.

_[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]] says_: You are effectively asking for
_free resolutions_ aka _cofibrant replacements_ of categories. There is not in general a 1-graph whose free category is equivalent to a given 1-category. But there may be "higher dimensional graphs" in a sense, such that this is true.

I'd like to reply to this in detail, because it is an interesting and important construction, but right now I need to do something else. But you can maybe get an impression by looking at the blog entry [Freely generated omega-Categories](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/10/freely_generated_categories.html).

_[[Eric Forgy|Eric]] says_: Great! Thanks for the references. I would find it to be very neat (and surprising) if any general category can be recovered this way, which is why I was specifically considering "countable" categories, where the set of objects does not form a continuum. In the continuum, you could imagine being able to sneak two infinitesimal composable morphisms onto any morphism so that all morphisms are effectively composites. When the objects do not form a continuum, you can imagine a set of "primordial" morphisms that cannot be written as composites of other morphisms.

It seems that when every morphism is a composite of other morphisms, i.e. there are no primordial morphisms, it would be difficult to find the directed graph I'm looking for. If higher degree edges somehow provide the magic ingredient, that would be neat.

_[[Eric Forgy|Eric]] says_: It seems what I was talking about might also be related to a [covering relation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covering_relation).
