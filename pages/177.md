The term "directed graph" is somewhat intermediate between two rather precisely delineated terms: [[digraph]] and [[quiver]].
In a sense, "directed graph" is an undefined term, but the latter two both are defined. 
Every digraph is a quiver, not every quiver is a [[digraph]]. 
This page also briefly treats the related technical terms **oriented graph**,  **bidirected graph**, and **signed graph**, the latter of which  can hardly be regarded as a directed graph. Each of the latter three terms   has a standard meaning in modern combinatorics.

The term _directed graph_ is used in both [[graph theory]] and [[category theory]].
The definition varies---even within *one* of the two theories.

In [[graph theory]], _directed graph_ (often abbreviated to the contraction _digraph_) nowadays usually means a [[digraph]], while in [[category theory]], directed graph/digraph means and always has meant a [[quiver]]. 
The basic the difference is: [[quivers]] may have multiple arrows in the *same* direction (often called "parallel"), and also *loops*, while [[digraphs]] may not have any of those.

## Overview of usual technical terms 


> We see one family, in the same room but hardly together. The family of signed, gain, and biased graphs is a lot like that. The Bibliography and Glossary are supposed to lead the family members to talk to one another. May they do so!  ([Thomas Zaslavsky: front page](#HomePageOfSignedGraphs))

The following table is meant to have *pragmatic* value. I has little *epistomological* value. 
It should go without saying for thinking readers that the table does not, like e.g. [[periodic table]] does, describe objective *connections between things*, but merely *conventional connections between language and things*. 
The table describes a clear-enough reality, yet is bound to read dated in the future, even *in substance* rather than style. 


| technical term | distinctive feature |  short verbal definition  | [[signature]]; and axioms, of the [[theory]] (in a narrow sense of "theory")| comments |  
|---------------------|-------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
|  directed graph |   n/a (context-dependent umbrella-term)       |  n/a |  n/a | n/a   |  
|  [[quiver]] |     loops allowed, parallel arcs allowed     | presheaf on the walking quiver | [[equality| = ]], two function symbols; more than one axioms (how many is up to interpretation)  |  |
|  [[digraph]] |    no loops, no parallel arcs, but 2-cycles allowed     | binary [[irreflexive relation]]  | [[equality| = ]], one relation symbol; one axiom expressing irreflexivity; if [[constructive logic]] is required, signature might be larger, requiring an [[apartness relation]] expressing irreflexivity    |  |
|  oriented [[graph]] |   looks essentially like oriented one-dimensional [[simplicial complex]]   | undirected simple graph whose edges were replaced by one arrow each | dependent on the chosen formalization of [[graph]]; if [[graph]] is formalized as a [[relation|relation]], and the orientedness by [[antisymmetry]], then the signature is: [[equality| = ]], one relation symbol; and the axioms then are: one axiom expressing irreflexivity, one axiom expressing antisymmetry; if [[constructive logic]] is required, the signature might be larger, requiring an [[apartness relation]] expressing irreflexivity |  |
|  signed [[graph]] | undirected [[graph]] with a sign on each edge    | undirected simple [[graph]] together with a function $\{$edges$\}$ $\rightarrow$ $\{-,+\}$,not subject to any axioms | dependent on the chosen formalization of [[graph|undirected simple graph]]; if [[graph|undirected simple graph]] is formalized in one of the usual ways as a [[relation|symmetric irreflexive relation]], and the signs in the usual way as two [[signature|constant symbols]], then the signature is:  [[equality| = ]], one relation symbol, two constant symbols; and the axioms then are: one axiom expressing irreflexivity, one axiom expressing symmetry; note that no axiom to express distinctness of the two constant symbols is necessary, as this, in the usual approach, is built into the signature; if [[constructive logic]] is required, the signature might be larger, requiring an [[apartness relation]] to express irreflexivity  | beware that this should *not* in a natural way be regarded a "directed graph", though they *are* often used in *contexts* together with directed graphs and thus belong on this page; in a sense, "signed graphs" are a non-example, an *odd-one-out*, in particular in that they seem tricky to categorically construct |
|  bidirected [[graph]] |  [[quiver]] with a sign on each vertex-arrow-*[[incidence|incidence relation]]*   | quiver together with function $\{$vertices$\}$ $\times$ $\{$arrows$\}$ $\rightarrow$ $\{-,+\}$, subject to axioms |   |  |

Note that there are two points of view in model theory, one regards [[equality| = ]] as a [[logic|logical symbol]] of a meta-language, the other regards  [[equality| = ]] as a binary relation symbol within the language under investigation. 
In the table, as a reminder that equality plays an important roles in these theories, the latter view was taken. 

## Table of definitions of directed graphs in various references

This is to give a compressed look-up table, quickly usable, telling you what definition of directed graph is being used in the reference you happen to be working with.

Note that "kind of directed graph" is a used in a loose, undefined sense, sufficiently clear from the context. 


## Signed graphs

A *signed graph* is a [[simple undirected graph|graph]] *each of whose edges has  been assigned one element of a specified two-element set*. 
The latter's elements are customarily interpreted as "signs", and *sometimes* the sign-set is also equipped with arithmetical structure, though this is *not* part of the definition.  

Signed graphs should *not* be regarded to be *directed graphs*. Signs on undirected edges are not the same as directional information. 
Of course, upon *arbitarily specifying a [[total order]] on the vertex set*, the signs *can* be interpreted to contain directional information, but this extraneous choice of total order is not natural.

Signed graphs (and the basic theorems of their theory) are notorious for being rediscovered over and over again; a critically annotated bibliography on signed graphs and their various guises is [Zaslavsky](#ZaslavskyBibliography).


In a sense, the [[theory]] of signed graphs has a [[[model theory|signature]] which contains at least two [[model theory|constant symbols]], whereas e.g. the theory of undirected simple graphs (in the narrowest sense) has none. 

A *signed graph* should *not* be regarded a "directed graph", though they *are* often used in *contexts* together with directed graphs and thus belong on this page; in a sense, "signed graphs" are a non-example, an odd-one-out, in particular in that they seem tricky to categorically construct.  




## Oriented graphs

An *oriented graph* is a [[simple undirected graph|graph]] *each of whose edges has  been given one of the two orientations*. 
As such, *no* multiplicities whatsoever are possible, not even *directed 2-cycles*($=$antiparallel arcs). 
This is the standard meaning of *oriented graph* in combinatorics, the term generally being perceived to signal that even 2-cycles are forbidden, in contrast to [[digraphs]] which may have them. 
There are several ways to formalize "oriented graph", and here we do not describe any of them. 




## Bidirected graphs

Roughly speaking, bidirected graphs are quivers in which *each non-loop arrow gets decorated with _two_ elements drawn from a two-element set fixed in advanced, one thought to be attached to the arrow's tail, the other to its head*. 
Like for signed graphs, the elements of this two-element set are *sometimes* interpreted to be *signs* and equipped with arithmetical structure (essentially, the two-element set is taken to be a two-element [[group]]). 
 
(The treatment of *loops* is slightly controversial in the combinatorical literature, prompting some ad-hoc-ery, and this is explicitly commented on at least once in the literature.)
The category-theoretic literature seems not to have picked up on this so far, and could clarify the issue. 

Bidirected graphs are important in the theory of [[flows]] on [[graphs]]. 





## Connections to category theory

Herein some evident aspects are pointed out explicitly.

### Underlying quivers

A basic connection is that for any category, its [[forgetful functor|underlying]] [[quiver]] is a directed graph. 

Another aspect is that a *nonempty* [[digraph]] never is isomorphic to the [[quiver]] [[forgetful functor|underlying]] any category: such a quiver *always* has a loop at each vertex, which is already enough to rule out any isomorphism. 


### An application of directed graphs to category theory

Briefly, and from a slightly [[model theory|model theoretical]] point of view, the charm of this application is that [[pasting scheme|A. J. Power's pasting theorem]] is an example of a *transfer* of knowledge from a *theory without [[signature (in logic)|function symbols]]* to a *theory with [[signature (in logic)|function symbols]]*. 
(The theory of [[digraphs]], strictly construed, is *purely relational*, while [[higher category theory]] makes essential use of several [[signature (in logic)|function symbols]]).

An example of a use of digraph theory in category theory is giving a rigorous justification of the  notational practice of [[pasting diagrams]]. 
This was achieved in the late 1980s (cf. e.g. [Johnson 1987](#Johnson1987), [Johnson 1989](#Johnson1989), [Power 1990](#Power1990)). 
In this approach, parallel arcs or loops are of secondary importance, and sometimes expressly forbidden, so the work of Johnson and Power can be seen as a genuine application of graph theory to category theory. 


### *All* quivers deemed irreflexive by Lawvere


There is an article of [[William Lawvere]] which is relevant in one precise respect to a disambiguation page such as the present one: *an unusual use of the adjective "irreflexive"*. 
Therein, one reads (cf. ([Lawvere 1989](#GeneralizedGraphs), page 272)) 

> [..] the elementary "parallel process" $E= \bullet\overset{\rightarrow}{\rightarrow}\bullet$ is a reflexive graph which happens to admit only one definition of composition making it into a category $\mathbf{P}$. [..] Its [[actions]] $S^{\mathbf{P}^{\mathrm{op}}}$ are the **irreflexive** graphs (the negative is in a way appropriate even for those objects which happen to have loops at some point $p$, for morphisms are allowed to interchange *any* two such loops).

With "the negative is in a way appropriate" Lawvere explains the use of the strong negation *irr-*, despite such an "irreflexive graph" being permitted to contain loops at *some* of its vertices, which is obviously different from what one would expect from the usual sense of [[irreflexive relation]]. 
This is a usage in need of explanation, all the more against the backdrop of contemporary teaching where the term "simple undirected graph" is often literally defined as symmetric irreflexive relation (on the vertex set).

Some authors have adopted this interesting variant sense of "irreflexive", prompting an additional use of the a modifier "strict" to form a composite "strict irreflexive graph". (cf. ([Brown et al 2008](#GraphsOfMorphismsOfGraphs)), which uses "digraph" as a synonym for "strict irreflexive graph", and this sense of "digraph" is precisely the one in [[digraph]]). 
In a sense, a [[digraph]] is a "strictly-Lawvere-irreflexive graph".



From a graph-theoretical point of view, every digraph is a quiver, but not every quiver is a digraph (again, in the sense of [Gutin and Bang-Jensen 2009](#DG2nd)).

## Cultural differences in what to regard as simpler 

The convention of formalising directed graphs like in [[digraph]] is widespread in modern combinatorics, but it is mostly just that: conventional. 
In particular, forbidding parallel arcs, and in particular, forbidding loops by yaking the  [[relative complement]] of $V\times V$ and the diagonal $\{(v,v)\colon v\in V\}$ is sometimes[^1] regarded to be a negative complication. 

This aspect looms large in the context of [[constructive mathematics]].
 
This is a matter of opinion and culture; similar comparisons can be found in what is perhaps the earliest article reviewing graph theory from a category theoretic perspective (cf. [Bumby-Latch 1986](#BumbyLatch1986)).

[^1]: T. Leinster: " ...  the irreflexivity condition tastes strange on a category theorist’s tongue. We’re suspicious of negatives. " In: [The n-Category Café: April 12, 2013](https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2013/04/colouring_a_graph.html)



Some reasonably distinct aspects are:

* While arguably the *simplest nontrivial limit of all*, the definition of [[digraphs]] uses a [[limit]] of the [[category of sets]], the [[cartesian product]] of the vertex set with itself, while the definition of [[quivers]] avoids doing so, and can therefore be interpreted in categories which do not have all binary products. 

* It is a fact that [[quivers]] are more general than [[digraph]]s: to have [[digraph]] offer multiple arcs or loops requires additional patching, like using *families of ordered pairs* (this is done in e.g. BondyMurty) or switching to other definitions.
Many references in the combinatorial literature are aware of that,  of course, e.g. ([Diestel 2010](#Diestel2010)) defines a "directed graph" precisely to be a [[quiver]], without mentioning the word.  

* The restriction, within modern combinatorics, to [[digraphs]] ($\simeq$ loopless quivers without any parallel arcs) is mostly a result of 

1. the kind *questions* that are answered in the combinatorial literature, which are often of a counting or decomposing kind,
1. a definite tendency in combinatorics to no shy away from *formalizing  multiplicities* by *attaching weights* of some "alien" type (mostly [[number]]s) to the single arc of a graph. 
Model-theoretically speaking, [[combinatorics]] rather uninhibitedly [[model theory|expands the signature]] if the need arises, while [[category theory]]  is reluctant to do so, and hardly ever does. 
Category theory prefers to have its constructions preplanned for a given purpose,  and carried out by a more uniform method. 


The difference between the two formalizations, given in [[digraph]] and [[quiver]], can be seen to be similar to the differences between [[material set theory]] and [[structural set theory]].

The material point of view makes the decision of how to represent the connections loom large (examples are the various different data structures for digraphs, such as signed adjacency matrices, signed incidence matrices, linked lists for adjacency *lists*, one often vastly more efficient than the other).  

The structural point of view, exemplified by [[quivers]], in a way already fixes the formalizing concept: functions. 
It then only remains to be decided how to represent function. 

All these points of view have disadvantages and advantages and it depends on what one is trying to do what one should use.
