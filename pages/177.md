## Terminology

The term _directed graph_ is used in both [[graph theory]] and [[category theory]] and the precise definition varies depending on the particular reference under consideration even within the same field.

In [[graph theory]], _directed graph_ or _digraph_ usually means a [[simple directed graph]].  In [[category theory]], _directed graph_ or _digraph_ usually means a [[quiver]], which may have multiple edges and loops.
