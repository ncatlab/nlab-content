## Idea

An _axiom_ is a [[proposition]] in [[logic]] that a given [[theory]] requires to be [[true]]: every [[model]] of the theory is required to make the axiom hold true.


## Definition

Given a language specified by a [[signature (in logic)]] (a collection of [[type]]s, [[function symbol]]s and [[relation symbol]]s), a [[theory]] is a collection of [[sequent]]s

$$
  \phi_1 \vdash_{\vec x} \psi_1\;,\;
  \phi_2 \vdash_{\vec x} \psi_2\;,\; \dots
$$

(asserting that "If  [[proposition]] $\phi_i$ is true in [[context]] $\vec x_i$ then also $\psi_i$ is/has to be true"). These are the **axioms** of the theory.
