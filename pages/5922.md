## Idea

An _axiom_ is a [[proposition]] in [[logic]] that a given [[theory]] requires to be [[true]]: every [[model]] of the theory is required to make the axiom hold true.


## Definition

Given a language specified by a [[signature (in logic)]] (a collection of [[type]]s, [[function symbol]]s and [[relation symbol]]s), a [[theory]] is the collection of assertions, e.g., [[sequent]]s

$$
  \phi_1 \vdash_{\vec x} \psi_1\;,\;
  \phi_2 \vdash_{\vec x} \psi_2\;,\; \dots
$$

in a [[sequent calculus]] (asserting that "If  [[proposition]] $\phi_i$ is true in [[context]] $\vec x_i$ then also $\psi_i$ is/has to be true"), that are derivable by applying rules of the ambient logic to some given set of sequents, called **axioms** of the theory. Put differently, a theory is generated from a set of axioms, by starting with those axioms and applying rules of deduction.
