## Idea

A _metabelian_ or _meta-abelian_ group is a [[group]] that is one step _beyond_ (Greek 'μετά') being _[[abelian group|abelian]]_.  The steps here are those in the [[normal series]] of a [[solvable group]].


## Definition

Let $G$ be a [[group]].  Then the following conditions are all equivalent:

*  $G$ satisfies the [[equational law]] that every element of the form $a b a' b' c d c' d' b a b' a' d c d' c'$ is the [[identity element]] (where primes indicate [[inverse element|inverses]]).

*  $G$ satisfies the equational law that $[[a,b],[c,d]]$ is the identity, where brackets indicate [[commutators]].

*  The [[commutator subgroup]] of $G$ is [[abelian group|abelian]].

*  $G$ has an abelian [[subgroup]] which is [[normal subgroup|normal]] and whose [[quotient group|quotient]] is also abelian.

*  $G$ has an abelian quotient group whose [[kernel]] is also abelian.

*  $G$ is [[solvable group|solvable]] with solvability at most $2$.

In this case, we say that $G$ is __meta-abelian__, or __metabelian__ for short.


## Properties

The solvable groups with solvability _exactly_ $2$ are precisely the groups that are metabelian but not [[abelian group|abelian]].  (Then the groups with solvability $1$ are those that are abelian but not trivial, and the [[trivial group]] is [[the]] only group of solvability $0$.)

Being metabelian is [[hereditary property|hereditary]] and [[cohereditary property|cohereditary]].  That is, [[subgroups]] and [[quotient groups]] of metabelian groups are also metabelian.


## Examples

Every group of [[cardinality|order]] less than $24$ is meatabelian; the smallest non-metabelian group is the [[symmetric group]] $S_4$.
