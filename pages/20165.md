## Idea

The _Tully-Fisher relation_ is a relation between the asymptotic behaviour of [[galaxy rotation curves]] and their total visible [[baryon|baryonic]] [[mass]]. 

For most observed [[galaxies]] their rotation curves do not follow the predictions of standard [[gravity]] applied to the visible [[baryon|baryonic]] [[mass]] distribution in the galaxy. This has led to the speculation that either there is further invisible but gravitating [[dark matter]] making up most of the mass of galaxies, or the laws of [[gravity]] are modified on galactic scales ("[[MOND]]"). 

Recent computer simulation ([FIRE](https://fire.northwestern.edu)) of [[galaxy|galactic]] [[structure formation]] using the [[standard model of cosmology|standard]] [[cold dark matter]] [[model (physics)|model]] qualitatively reproduces the peculiar [[galactic rotation curves]] that motivated dark matter (or [[MOND]], for that matter) in the first place ([Hopkins et al. 17, Figure 4, Figure 5](#Hopkins17)):

and also reproduces well the baryonic [[Tully-Fisher relation]] ([El-Badry et al. 18, Figure 4](#ElBadry18)) which used to be an issue in the [[standard model of cosmology|standard]] [[cold dark matter]] [[model (physics)|model]]:
