## Idea

A _chromatic spectral sequence_ is a [[spectral sequence of a filtered stable homotopy type]] for the case of a [[filtered object in an (infinity,1)-category|filtering]] given by a [[chromatic tower]]. ([Wilson 13](#Wilson13))

This is a type of [[spectral sequence]] useful for computing the $E^1$-term in an [[Adams-Novikov spectral sequence]]. The traditional formulation is due to [[Doug Ravenel]].
