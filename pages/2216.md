
Charles Sanders Peirce (1839-1914), a philosopher, logician and scientist, was one of the founders of modern symbolic [[logic]]. In particular, he developed a form of [[predicate logic]]. Peirce devised a graphical notation, known as **existential graphs**, to represent logical calculi. There were three systems of such graphs: the system _alpha_, to represent [[propositional logic]], the system _beta_, to represent [[predicate logic]], and the system _gamma_, to represent [[modal logic]].

[[Geraldine Brady]] and [[Todd Trimble]] have given a category theoretic interpretation of the alpha and beta systems. The latter, a form of [[string diagram|string diagrammatic]] notation, was developed ([PontoShul](#PontoShul)) into a [[string diagram]] notation for [[indexed monoidal categories]]. A development also appears in [MellZeil](#MellZeil).

Peirce's philosophy can be seen as Schellingism transformed in light of (in Peirce's time) modern physics, as Peirce himself notes in an 1894 letter to William James:

> My views were probably influenced by [[Schelling]] - by all stages of Schelling, but especially the _Philosophie der Natur_. I consider Schelling as enormous, and one thing I admire about him is his freedom from the trammels of system, and his holding himself uncommitted to any previous utterance. in that, he is like a scientific man. If you were to call my philosophy Schellingism transformed in the light of modern physics, I should not take it hard.
