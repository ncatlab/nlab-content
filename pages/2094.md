Given a ring, or a $k$-algebra (unital or not) $A$, its maximal spectrum $Specm A$ is the set of its maximal ideals. 

If $k$ is a field, and $R$ is a finitely generated [[noetherian ring|noetherian]] commutative unital $k$-algebra without nilpotent elements, then $Specm A$ equipped with Zariski topology is a [[noetherian topological space]]; the varieties in the classical sense (cf. chapter 1 of Hartshorne) are exactly the spectra of such $k$-algebras. A more appropriate spectrum for general commutative unital rings is the [[prime spectrum]]. 

In functional analysis, there is a slight variant of this notion, defined using continuous characters, the [[Gel'fand spectrum]] of a $C^*$-algebra, where however the topology is much richer, indeed Hausdorff.
