Given a [[ring]], or a $k$-[[associative algebra|algebra]] (unital or not) $A$, its __maximal spectrum__ $Spec_m A$ is the set of its [[maximal ideals]].

If $k$ is a [[field]], and $R$ is a finitely generated [[noetherian ring|noetherian]] commutative unital $k$-algebra without [[nilpotent elements]], then $Spec_m A$ equipped with the [[Zariski topology]] is a [[noetherian topological space]]; the [[algebraic variety|varieties]] in the classical sense (cf. chapter 1 of Hartshorne) are exactly the spectra of such $k$-algebras. A more appropriate spectrum for general commutative unital rings is the [[prime spectrum]].

In [[functional analysis]], there is a slight variant of this notion, defined using (automatically continuous) characters, the [[Gel'fand spectrum]] of a $C^*$-[[C*-algebra|algebra]], where however the topology is much richer, indeed [[compactum|compact Hausdorff]] ([[locally compact space|locally compact Hausdorff]], in the non-unital case).
