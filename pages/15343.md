## Idea
In any context it is interesting to ask when a contravariant hom-functor $\operatorname{Hom}(-,X)$ reflects isomorphisms, i.e. if homming into an object is enough to distinguish isomorphism classes. In a $2$-categorical setting, the analogous question is if homming into an object reflects equivalences.

## Definition

_Conceptual completeness_ refers to the result of Makkai and Reyes that in the $2$-category $\mathbf{Pretop}$ of pretoposes, homming into the pretopos [[Set]] $\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathbf{Pretop}}(-,X) : \mathbf{Pretop} \to \mathbf{Cat}$ reflects equivalences.

That is, if $f : T_1 \to T_2$ is a pretopos morphism and $- \circ f : \operatorname{Hom}_{\mathbf{Pretop}}(-, T_2) \to \operatorname{Hom}_{\mathbf{Pretop}}(-,T_1)$ is an equivalence, then $f$ was also. Pretopos morphisms are just [[interpretation|interpretations]] of theories; a pretopos morphism is an interpretation into [[Set]] is an interpretion of the source theory into the [[internal logic]] of [[Set]], and is therefore a [[model]].

Since pretoposes are just [[exact completion|effectivizations]] of [[syntactic categories]] of [[first-order theories]], this means: if a functor between the categories of models of $T_1$ and $T_2$ is an equivalence and is induced by an interpretation $T_1 \to T_2$, then that interpretation must be part of a bi-interpretation, i.e. $T_1$ and $T_2$ are equivalent as syntactic categories via pretopos morphisms.

[[Makkai duality]] states that $\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathbf{Pretop}}(-,X)$ factors through the $2$-category of [[_ultracategories_]] (categories equipped with [[ultraproduct functors]]) (which also contains $\mathbf{Set}$) and that $\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathbf{Pretop}}(-,\mathbf{Set})$ is left-adjoint to $\mathbf{Hom}_{\mathbf{Ult}}(-,\mathbf{Set})$.

Furthermore, the unit of this adjunction is an equivalence, so that a pretopos $T$ is equivalent to the category of ultrafunctors (ultraproduct-preserving functors) from $\mathbf{Mod}(T)$ to $\mathbf{Set}$, i.e. any ultrafunctor $\mathbf{Mod}(T) \to \mathbf{Set}$ is induced by taking points in models of some definable set $X \in T$.

This means: when viewed as a functor to the $2$-category of ultracategories instead, $\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathbf{Pretop}}(-,\mathbf{Set})$ creates equivalences also, so that the pretopos/theory $T$ can be reconstructed up to bi-interpretability from its ultracategory of models. This is what is known as _strong conceptual completeness_.

##Remarks
In his AMS monograph on duality and definability in first-order logic, Makkai refined the above reconstruction result to work with just the (ultra) [[core]] of the ultracategory of models of $T$. Awodey and his students replace the ultracategory structure on this groupoid with a related topology instead; this is the "spectral groupoid" which forms the basis of the [[logical scheme]] approach.
