## Idea

A **Lie group** is a smooth [[manifold]] whose underlying set of points is equipped with a structure of a [[group]] and the multiplication and inverse maps for the group are smooth maps.  In other words, it is a [[group object]] [[internalization|internal to]] [[Diff]].

Usually the manifold considered is over complex or real numbers and finite-dimensional (f.d.), but extensions to some other ground fields and infinite-dimensional setting are also very interesting. A real Lie group is _compact_ (or _connected_, _simply connected_, etc) if its underlying space is [[compact space|compact]] (or [[connected space|connected]], [[simply connected space|simply connected]], etc). 

Every connected f.d. real Lie group is homeomorphic to a [[product]] of a compact Lie group and an Euclidean space. Every abelian connected compact f.d. real Lie group is a [[torus]] (a product of circles $T^n = S^1\times S^1 \times \ldots \times S^1$).

There is an infinitesimal version of a Lie group, a so-called local Lie group, where the multiplication and the inverse are only partially defined, namely if the arguments of these operations are in a sufficiently small neighborhood of identity. There is a natural equivalence of local Lie groups by means of agreeing (topologically and algebraically) on a smaller neighborhood of the identity. The category of local Lie groups is equivalent to the category of connected simply connected Lie groups. 

[[Sophus Lie]] has proved several theorems -- [[Lie's three theorems]] -- on relation between [[Lie algebra]]s and Lie groups. So called [[Lie's third theorem]] was about the equivalence of the category of f.d. real Lie algebras and local Lie groups. Cartan has extended this to a global integrability theorem called the Cartan--Lie theorem, nowadays after Serre also called Lie's third theorem.
