###### Definition

The __smash product__ $A \wedge B$ of two [[pointed sets]] $A$ and $B$ is the [[quotient set]] of the [[cartesian product]] $A \times B$ where all points with the basepoint as a coordinate (the one from $A$ or the one from $B$) are identified.

The subset that is 'smashed' here can be identified with the [[wedge sum]] $A \vee B$, so the definition of the smash product can be summarised as follows:
$$ A \wedge B = \frac{A \times B}{A \vee B} $$

###### Definition

The smash product is the [[tensor product]] in the [[closed monoidal category]] of [[pointed sets]].  
That is, it is characterized by the existence of [[natural isomorphisms]]

$$ 
  Fun_*(A \wedge B, C) \cong Fun_*(A, Fun_*(B, C)) 
$$

where $Fun_*(A,B)$ is the set of basepoint-preserving [[functions]] from $A$ to $B$, itself made into a pointed set by taking as basepoint the [[constant function]] from all of $A$ to the basepoint in $B$.

This easily generalizes to the smash products of many spaces, but they do not necessarily agree with iterated version: it is not necessary that $A\wedge (B\wedge C) \cong (A\wedge B)\wedge C$.

For more details see at _[Pointed object -- Closed and monoidal structure](pointed+object#ClosedMonoidalStructure)_. See also for instance ([Elmendorf-Mandell 07, construction 4.19](#ElmendorfMandell07)).

### For general pointed objects

Smash products can be defined for [[pointed objects]] in any [[category]] $C$ with [[finite limit]] and [[colimit]].  


For $\mathbf{H}$ a [[topos]], with $\mathbf{H}^{\ast/}$ its category of [[pointed objects]], the smash product is the [[tensor product]] that makes this a [[closed monoidal category]].



## Properties

If finite [[product]]s in $C$ preserve finite colimits, then the smash product is [[associativity|associative]], and if $C$ is also [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]], then it makes the category of pointed objects in $C$ [[closed monoidal category|closed monoidal]].  However, if finite products in $C$ do not preserve finite colimits, the smash product can fail to be associative.

## Examples

### Of pointed topological spaces

The most common case when $C$ is a category of [[topological spaces]].  In that case, the [[natural transformation|natural]] [[continuous function|map]] $A\wedge (B\wedge C)\to (A\wedge B)\wedge C$ is a [[homeomorphism]] provided $C$ is a [[locally compact Hausdorff space]]. Thus if both $A$ and $C$ are locally compact Hausdorff, then we have the [[associativity]] $A\wedge(B\wedge C)\cong (A\wedge B)\wedge C$. 

Associativity fails in general for the category [[Top]] of all topological spaces; however, it is satisfied for pointed objects in any [[convenient category of topological spaces]], since such a category is cartesian closed.  In particular, the smash product is associative for pointed [[compactly generated spaces]].
