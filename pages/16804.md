# Idea

A **chord diagram** (of order $n$) is basically a [[circle]] marked with $2n$ distinct points and $n$ chords joining those points, considered up to rotation of the circle. An **arc diagram** is what you get when you cut the circle at any of the $2n$ segments between the marked points, breaking the rotational symmetry.  For example, here is a chord diagram of order 3:

<center>
[[!include chord diagram > chord diagram]]
</center>

And here is the arc diagram obtained by cutting the chord diagram at the segment between points 0 and 5:

<center>
[[!include chord diagram > arc diagram]]
</center>

An arc diagram of order $n$ is entirely determined by specifying a [[fixed point]] free [[involution]] $\alpha$ on the [[ordinal]] $\mathbf{2n} = \{0 \to 1 \to \dots \to 2n{-}1\}$.  (In the above example, $\alpha = (02)(13)(45)$.)  The 
[[symmetric group]] $S_{2n}$ acts naturally on arc diagrams of order $n$ by [[conjugation action|conjugation]].  In particular, the generator $\tau$ of the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_{2n}$ (where $\tau$ = addition by 1 modulo $2n$) acts by sending $\alpha \mapsto \tau\circ\alpha\circ\tau^{-1}$, which has the effect of moving the first vertex to the end and shifting all other vertices to the left.  Finally, taking the [[quotient]] (of the set of arc diagrams) by this action recovers the set of chord diagrams.
