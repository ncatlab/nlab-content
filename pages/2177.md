## Idea ##

Consider the [[minimal negation operator]] of arity $k$, written in the form $\nu (x_1, \dots, x_k)$ or `(` $x_1$ `,` $\ldots$ `,` $x_k$ `)`.

Read as a function, $\nu$ returns a value of $1$ in exactly those cases where exactly one of its arguments is $0$.

Read as an assertion, under the interpretation where $1 = \mathop{true}$, $\nu$ makes a statement to the effect that exactly one of its arguments is $\mathop{false}$.

The relation between the function and the assertion is this, that the fiber of $1$ under the function captures precisely the models of the assertion.

This is pretty ugly, but it's the best I have by way of a formal definition at present:

I'll be working to make it more elegantine and less elephantine ...
