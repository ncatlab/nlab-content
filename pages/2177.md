## Idea ##

Consider the [[minimal negation operator]] of arity $k$, written in the form $\nu (x_1, \dots, x_k)$ or $\text{⦗}\: x_1 \text{﹐} \ldots \text{﹐} x_k \:\text{⦘}$.

Read as a function, the expression $\text{⦗}\: x_1 \text{﹐} \ldots \text{﹐} x_k \:\text{⦘}$ returns a value of $1$ in exactly those cases where exactly one of its arguments is $0$.

Read as an assertion, under the interpretation where $1$ represents logical truth, the expression $\text{⦗}\: x_1 \text{﹐} \ldots \text{﹐} x_k \:\text{⦘}$ makes a statement to the effect that exactly one of its arguments is false.

The relation between the function and the assertion is this, that the fiber of $1$ under the function captures precisely the models of the assertion.

For added concreteness, consider the case where $k = 3$.  Writing $\neg x$ as $x'$, the minimal negation opus $\text{⦗}\: u \text{﹐} v \text{﹐} w \:\text{⦘}$ can be written as a sum of products of positive and negative literals in accord with the following equation:

$$\text{⦗}\: u \text{﹐} v \text{﹐} w \:\text{⦘} \quad = \quad u' v w + u v' w + u v w'$$

That should bell a few rings &hellip;

Clearly, negation and differentiation are not the same thing, but a seeming coincidence of that sort does get one to asking whether there might be a deeper analogy between flipping bits and taking derivatives.

But that, as they say, is another subplot, the ravel of which I'll knit up on the warp of [[differential logic]].  As it happens, I had no glimmer of the link between these two subjects when I happened on the forms that graph theorists call _cacti_ as a solution to the problems I was having with programming an efficient modeler and prover for propositional calculus.

This is pretty ugly, but it's the best I have by way of a formal definition at present:

I'll be working to make it more elegantine and less elephantine ...
