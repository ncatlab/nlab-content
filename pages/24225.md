> **Abstract.** [[univalence|Univalent]] [[homotopy type theory]] (HoTT) may be seen as a language for the [[(infinity,1)-category|category]] of [[infinity-groupoid|$\infty$-groupoids]]. It is being developed as a [[univalent foundations|new foundation for mathematics]] and as an [[internal language]] for ([[elementary (infinity,1)-topos|elementary]]) [[(infinity,1)-topos|higher toposes]]. We develop the theory of [[factorization systems]], [[reflective subuniverses]], and [[modalities]] in [[homotopy type theory]], including their construction using a "[[localization]]" [[higher inductive type]]. This produces in particular the [[(n-connected, n-truncated) factorization system|($n$-connected, $n$-truncated) factorization system]] as well as internal presentations of [[subtoposes]], through [[lex]] [[modalities]]. We also develop the [[categorical semantics|semantics]] of these constructions.
