## Idea

This is a theorem due to [[Thomas Fox]] which characterizes products in a [[cartesian monoidal category]] as an algebraic structure given by natural transformations rather than in terms of a universal poperty.

## Theorem

(to be completed)

## Related concepts

A similar but slightly more complicated theorem seems to exist for [[symmetric powers in symmetric monoidal categories enriched over modules over a (Q plus)-algebra]].
