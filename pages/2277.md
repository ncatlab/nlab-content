[[Grothendieck]] among his many works published three series of works attempting to build the foundations for algebraic geometry. 

* The first is the series FGA written at the end of 1950-s alone; it is sort of quick outline of the theory and some deep results with proofs at the beginning of the period of the development of scheme theory. Modern version of the material in FGA appeared as a book "FGA explained" (ICTP, Trieste 2003-5). 

* EGA, written with help of J. Dieudonne. This is a detailed work on scheme theory (our [[schemes]] are in EGA called preschemes; EGA's scheme is what we call a separated scheme). The numbering is nontrivial as it has chapter 0, the preliminaries which were written at the beginning of various chapters. The published part of EGA is in Publ. IHÉS, now free online at [numdam](http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/recherche?au=Grothendieck&format=short) (detailed links to chapters will be added here later). We plan to list here the grand plan and some remarks and links. The thing is complicated by the existence of somewhat different reedition of EGA I as a single book 1971; what complicated citations.  

* SGA are the writeups of seminars at IHÉS lead by Grothendieck, work of the members of the seminar under the guidance of Grothendieck are included. 

Both EGA and SGA were never completed. Part of the non-completed EGA existed in terms of Grothendieck's "prenotes" and small part of them is preserved and a little piece even published. Part of unfinished plan of SGA is attained in quick way by Deligne as SGA 4 1/2 (in other to justify preliminaries for his proof of Weil conjectures), what Grothendieck did not approve.
