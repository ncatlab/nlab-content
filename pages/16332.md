Michael Friedman is an American philosopher. He has a developed a neo-Kantian philosophy which looks

> to understand the concrete historical process by which mathematical structures, physical theories of space, time, and motion, and mechanical constitutive principles organically evolve together so as to issue,  successively, in increasingly sophisticated mathematical representations of experience. ([Friedman 2010, p. 698](#Fried10))

This he does in particular through detailed historical studies of the response of [[Kant]] response to [[Newtonian]] physics and that of the [[Vienna Circle]] to Einstein's [[general relativity]].
