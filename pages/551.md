An object $X$ of a well-behaved category (such as a [[topos]]) is __decidable__ if its diagonal $X\to X\times X$ is complemented, as a subobject of $X\times X$.

This means that in the [[internal logic]] of the category, it is true that "for any $x,y\in X$, either $x=y$ or $x\neq y$."  Of course, in a [[Boolean category]], every object is decidable.

In [[constructivism]], where [[Set]] is not assumed Boolean, one says that a set $X$ has __decidable equality__ if it is a decidable object of $\Set$.  Sometimes one says that such a set $X$ is __discrete__, although of course this term has many meanings.

A _decidable subobject_ simply means a [[complemented subobject]].  Again, in constructivism, a decidable subobject in $\Set$ is called a _[[decidable subset]]_.
