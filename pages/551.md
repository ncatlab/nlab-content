##Idea
A _decidable object_ is the categorical rendering of the notion of a decidable set from [[computability theory]].

##Definition

An object $X$ of a [[coherent category]] is called _decidable_ if its [[equality relation]] $\Delta_X:X\to X\times X\quad ,$ is [[complement|complemented]], as a subobject of $X\times X$ .


This means that in the [[internal logic]] of the category, it is true that "for any $x,y\in X$ , either $x=y$ or $x\neq y$".

##Properties

$0$ and $1$ are always decidable, and so is every [[natural numbers object]] $N$ in a topos. A subobject of a decidable object is decidable.

Of course, in a [[Boolean category]], every object is decidable. Conversely in a [[topos]] $\mathcal{E}$, or more generally a coherent category with a [[subobject classifier]], every object is decidable precisely if $\mathcal{E}$ is Boolean.

In [[constructive mathematics]], where [[Set]] is not assumed Boolean, one says that a set $X$ has _[[decidable equality]]_ if it is a decidable object of $\Set$.

A _decidable subobject_ simply means a [[complemented subobject]].  Again, in constructive mathematics, a decidable subobject in $\Set$ is called a _[[decidable subset]]_.
