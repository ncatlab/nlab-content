## Idea

For [[electromagnetism]] the _Lorenz gauge condition_ is one possible [[gauge fixing]] condition: It requests that the [[divergence]] of the [[gauge potential]] $A$ [[differential 1-form]] vanishes: $d \star A = 0$. 


On [[Minkowski spacetime]] in standard [[coordinates]] this is the condition $\partial_\mu A^\mu = 0$ (using [[Einstein summation convention]]).

In [[BV-BRST formalism]] this gauge (and its variants) is implement by introducing the auxiliary "[[Nakanishi-Lautrup field]]" together with its "[[antighost field]]", see at _[[quantization of Yang-Mills theory]]_.
