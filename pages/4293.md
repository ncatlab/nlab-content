## Defintion

For $f \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R})$ a [[smooth function]] with $n$th [[derivative]] $f^{(n)} \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R})$ and $c$ a [[real number]], its **Taylor series** at $c$ is the [[power series]]

$$
  \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{1}{n!} f^{(n)}(c) (x-c)^n
$$

For $f \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R})$ a [[smooth function]] with $n$th [[derivative]] $f^{(n)} \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R})$, its **Mac Laurin series** is its Taylor series at [[zero]]:

$$
  \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{1}{n!} f^{(n)}(0) x^n
$$


Similarly for functions on any [[Cartesian space]] or [[smooth manifold]].

###### Theorem
**(Borel's theorem)**

The morphism

$$
  C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^{k+l})
  \to
  C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^k) [ [ X_1, \cdots X_l] ]
$$

obtained by forming Taylor series in $l$ variables is surjective.

In particular, every [[power series]] in $\mathbb{R}[ [ X] ]$ is the taylor series of some [[smooth function]] on the [[real line]].
