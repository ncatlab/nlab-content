## Defintion

Let $f \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R})$ a [[smooth function]] with $n$th [[derivative]] $f^{(n)} \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R})$ and let $c$ be a [[real number]]. 

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

The **Taylor series** of $f$ at $c$ is the [[formal power series]]

$$
  \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{1}{n!} f^{(n)}(c) (x-c)^n
  \,.
$$

###### Definition

For $f \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R})$ a [[smooth function]] with $n$th [[derivative]] $f^{(n)} \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R})$, its **Mac Laurin series** is its Taylor series at [[zero]]:

$$
  \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{1}{n!} f^{(n)}(0) x^n
  \,.
$$

###### Remark

Similarly definition apply to functions on any [[Cartesian space]] or [[smooth manifold]].

## Properties

###### Proposition

The Taylor series of a [[smooth function]] $f$ at any point may have vanishing [[radius of convergence]], but it is always an [[asymptotic expansion]] of $f$.

###### Theorem
**(Borel's theorem)**

The map

$$
  C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^{k+l})
  \to
  C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^k) [ [ X_1, \cdots X_l] ]
$$

obtained by forming Taylor series in $l$ variables is [[surjection|surjective]].

=--

In particular, every [[power series]] in $\mathbb{R}[ [ X] ]$ is the taylor series of some [[smooth function]] on the [[real line]].

###### Proof

The proof is reproduced for instance in [[Models for Smooth Infinitesimal Analysis|MSIA, I, 1.3]]
