## Idea

A **setoid** is a collection of things (which could be a [[set]], a [[type]], or a [[preset]] depending on the chosen [[foundations]]) equipped with an [[equivalence relation]] or a [[pseudo-equivalence relation]]. Setoids are commonly used in "impoverished" foundations of mathematics that lack a primitive notion of [[quotient]]; see for instance [[Bishop set]].

## Definition 

### In category theory

A **setoid** is a [[thin category|thin]] [[dagger category]], or a dagger category [[enriched category|enriched]] in [[truth values]]. Every thin dagger category is a [[groupoid]]. 

### In type theory

A setoid is a type $T$ equipped with an [[equivalence relation]] $\equiv$. Setoids are commonly used in type theories that lack [[quotient sets]].
