In a [discussion](http://www.mta.ca/~cat-dist/catlist/1999/atcat) with [[Vaughan Pratt]] on the categories mailing list, [[Peter Freyd]] gave a very sharp description of the commonalities and differences between [[abelian categories]] and [[topos]]es (or, in the first place, between abelian categories and [[pretopos]]es), by introducing a finitely axiomatized theory of "AT categories". As it turns out, this theory embodies the commonalities with such precision that every AT category splits as a [[product]] of an [[abelian category]] and a [[pretopos]]. 

Remarkably, the properties in common are basically exactness conditions, and the sharp dichotomy between abelian categories and pretoposes can be concentrated solely in the behavior of the initial object. We have taken the liberty of slightly reformulating some of Freyd's axioms.

## Definition

Freyd introduces some baseline assumptions on the categories in question: 

* [[finitely complete category|Finite completeness]], 

* Presence of an [[initial object]], 

* Presence of [[pushout|pushouts]] for pairs of [[morphism|arrows]] one of which is [[monomorphism|monic]], 

* Presence of pushouts for [[kernel pair]]s

Each of these assumptions obtains in any [[abelian category]] and in any [[pretopos]]. 

Most of the AT axioms Freyd introduces can be phrased directly in terms of such [[limit]]s and [[colimit]]s, and these axioms have a simple logical structure: they are just [[Horn theory|Horn clauses]] in the predicates stipulated by these baseline assumptions. This may look like a side comment for logicians, but it may well signal that Freyd intends to invoke, if pressed for details of proofs, one of a battery of representation theorems (such as the representation theorem for regular categories) whose precise expressions involve Horn clauses. 

Anyway, to follow what Freyd is saying here a bit: by making choices for each such universal construction, categories satisfying these assumptions can be considered models of a suitable [[essentially algebraic theory]]. In any case, each of these baseline assumptions can be turned into predicates (e.g., "$(p, q)$ is a pushout pair for pairs of arrows $(f, g)$" is a predicate $P(p, q; f, g)$ for a first-order theory of categories with these baseline assumptions), and the majority of axioms Freyd writes down, in particular all of the first 8 below, are expressible as universal Horn clauses in such predicates. 

The sharp dichotomy which separates A from T is concentrated in the following definition: 

+-- {: .un_def}
######Definition
Let $0$ be the initial object, and let $\pi_1: 0 \times X \to 0$, $\pi_2: 0 \times X \to X$ be the two product projections. We say $X$ is of **type T** if $\pi_1$ is an isomorphism, and **type A** if $\pi_2$ is an isomorphism.
=--

A pretopos will turn out to be precisely an AT category in which every object is of type T, and an abelian category will turn out to be an AT category where every object is of type A. 

Now here come the AT exactness axioms. Again, each of them is satisfied in every abelian category and in every pretopos, and part of Freyd's point is that any exactness axiom satisfied in both classes of categories is a logical consequence of this set of axioms. Some of Freyd's remarks are included in parentheses. 

A category meeting the baseline assumptions above is an **AT category** if the following 8 axioms plus axiom "AE" are satisfied. 

1. The category is an effective [[regular category]]. ("Yes this can be stated as universal Horn conditions on pullbacks and the special pushouts mentioned above.")

1. The arrow $0 \to 1$ is monic. ("Note that it follows that all maps from $0$ are monic.")

1. If $i: A \to C$ is monic, then any pushout square 
$$\array{
A & \stackrel{i}{\to} & C \\
\downarrow & & \downarrow \\
B & \to & D
}$$
is also a pullback. A square that is simultaneously a pushout and a pullback will be called a "dolittle square". 

1. The functor $0 \times -$ preserves pushouts of kernel pairs, and pushouts of pairs of arrows one of which is monic. 

1. If $f: B \to 0 \times C$ is epic and
$$\array{
A & \to & B \\
\downarrow & & \downarrow f \\
0 & \to & 0 \times C
}$$
is a pullback, then it's a dolittle square.

1. Pushouts of pairs of morphisms, one of which is monic, are universal (i.e., stable under pullback).  

1. Define a functor $T$ by the pushout diagram 
$$\array{
0 \times X & \stackrel{\pi_1}{\to} & 0 \\
\pi_2 \downarrow & & \downarrow \\
X & \to & T X
}$$
Then $T$ preserves pullbacks. 

1. Given a morphism $f: X \to Y$, if $T f$ and $0 \times f$ are isomorphisms, then so is $f$. 

This is the basic list of exactness assumptions which permit a sharp comparison between pretoposes and abelian categories. From this list alone one can prove that every AT category embeds faithfully in a product of a pretopos and an abelian category. To show that every AT category is _equivalent_ to such a product, Freyd appends the following axiom involving an existential Horn condition: 

* **(AE)** For every object $X$, there is a map $\xi: T X \to X$ such that 
$$0 \times X \stackrel{\pi_1}{\to} X \stackrel{\xi}{\leftarrow} T X$$ 
is a coproduct diagram, and the canonical map $X \to T X$ is a retraction of $\xi$.  

To bring actual toposes into the picture, Freyd adds some more axioms, but let's first take stock and see what this gives us. 

## Basic consequences of the AT axioms

+-- {: .un_prop}
######Proposition
For any $X$ the unique map $0 \to X$ is monic. 
=--

+-- {: .proof}
######Proof
By axiom 2, the map $0 \to 1$ is monic. The pullback-preserving functor $- \times X$ preserves monos, so 

$$0 \times X \stackrel{! \times 1_X}{\to} 1 \times X \cong X$$

(which is just the second projection $\pi_2: 0 \times X \to X$) is monic. The unique map $0 \to 0 \times X$ is monic since it has a retraction $\pi_1: 0 \times X \to0$. The result follows. 
=-- 

+-- {: .un_prop}
######Proposition
Binary coproducts exist. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof} 
######Proof
Because we can take the pushout of a pair of monos $0 \to X$, $0 \to Y$. 
=-- 

+-- {: .un_prop}
######Proposition
Coproducts are disjoint. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof}
######Proof
First observe that the pullback of the two coprojections is initial, as is obvious from axiom 3. 

Now consider the pushout diagram 
$$\array{
0 & \to & Y \\
\downarrow & & \downarrow i_Y \\
X & \underset{i_X}{\to} & X + Y
}$$
We must prove that $i_X$, $i_Y$ are monic. It suffices to verify that on pulling back this diagram along $i_X$, that the pullback map $i_{X}^*(i_X)$ is an isomorphism (and similarly that $i_{Y}^*(i_Y)$ is an iso). We have just observed that $i_{X}^* Y$ is initial, and since $0 \to Y$ is monic and pulling back preserves monos, the map $i_{X}^*(0 \to Y)$ is monic (and therefore an isomorphism since monos to the initial object are isos in any category). Hence the pulled back diagram takes the form 
$$\array{
0 & \to & 0 \\
\downarrow & & \downarrow \\
i_{X}^* X & \underset{i_{X}^*(i_X)}{\to} & X
}$$
but this is a pushout diagram by axiom 6. It follows that the bottom map is an iso, as desired.

## Category of type A objects is abelian

In this section we show that the full subcategory of type A objects forms an abelian category. 

+-- {: .un_lem}
######Lemma
An object is of type A if and only if there exists a map to $0$. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof}
######Proof
If $X$ is of type A, then we clearly have $X \cong 0 \times X \stackrel{\pi_1}{\to} 0$. Conversely, suppose there exists $p: X \to 0$. Note that since $0 \to 1$ is monic, there is at most one map $Y \to 0$ for any object $Y$. It follows quickly that maps $Y \to X$ are in natural bijective correspondence with maps $Y \to X \times 0$, so that $X \cong X \times 0$ by the Yoneda lemma.
=--

From this lemma, it follows that the full subcategory of type A objects in an AT category $C$ is equivalent to the category $C/0$, which is the category of coalgebras for the functor $A(X) = 0 \times X$. Hence the category of type A objects is coreflective. 

+-- {: .un_lem}
######Lemma
Objects of type A are closed under binary products, finite coproducts, subobjects, and quotient objects (= cokernels of kernel pairs). 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof}
######Proof
This follows from the fact that the category of type A objects is the slice category $C/0$. 
=--

Before we prove the next lemma, recall that in a category with zero objects, a **kernel** of an arrow $f: A \to B$ is an equalizer of the pair $f, 0: A \to B$. This is the same as a pullback 

$$\array{
K & \to & A \\
\downarrow & & \downarrow f \\
0 & \to & B
}$$

Cokernels are defined dually, and can be formulated dually as certain pushouts. Since pushouts along monos exist, we can take the cokernel of any mono, and in particular the cokernel of any kernel. 

+--{: .un_lem}
######Lemma
In the category of type A objects, every mono is the kernel of its cokernel, and every epi is the cokernel of its kernel. 
=--

+-- {: .proof}
######Proof
Of course, $0$ is a zero object in the category of type A objects. If $i: A \to B$ is a mono in the category of type A objects, then the pushout 
$$\array{
A & \stackrel{i}{\to} & B \\
\downarrow & & \downarrow \\
0 & \to & coker(i)
}$$
exists and is also a pullback, by axiom 3, and hence $i$ is the kernel of its cokernel. Now suppose $f: A \to C$ is an epi in the category of type A objects. Since $0 \times C \cong C$, we have an epi $f: A \to 0 \times C$. Then, by axiom 5, the pullback 
$$\array{
ker(f) & \to & A \\
\downarrow & & \downarrow f \\
0 & \to & 0 \times C
}$$
is also a pushout, so $f$ is the cokernel of its kernel. 
=--

+--{: .un_thm}
######Theorem
The category of type A objects is an abelian category. 
=--

+-- {: .proof}
######Proof
Any category with zero objects, binary products and coproducts, and in which every mono is the kernel of its cokernel and every epi is the cokernel of its kernel, is in fact an abelian category. See Freyd-Scedrov, _Categories, Allegories_, 1.598 (p. 95). 
=--

## Category of type T objects is a pretopos

Now we show that the full subcategory of type T objects is a pretopos. It is clear that $0 \times 0 \cong 0$ (since $0 \to 1$ is monic), so $0$ is a type T object. 

+-- {: .un_lem}
######Lemma
If $A$ is type A and $T$ is type T, then there exists exactly one map $A \to T$. Type T objects are characterized by this property. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof}
######Proof
There is exactly one morphism $A \to 0$. Hence morphisms $A \to T$ are in bijection with maps $A \to 0 \times T \cong 0$, of which there is exactly one. For the second statement, suppose that $X$ has the property that there is exactly one map $A \to X$ for each type A object. Such objects $X$ are closed under products, and $0$ is such an object; therefore $0 \times X$ is such an object. On the other hand, $0 \times X$ is of type A since it projects to $0$. Hence there is at most one morphism $0 \times X \to 0 \times X$, and it follows that $0 \times X \to 0 \to 0 \times X$ is the identity, so that $0 \times X \cong 0$. Thus $X$ is of type T. 
=-- 

+-- {: .un_cor}
######Corollary
The initial object $0$ is strict in the category of type T objects. 
=--

+-- {: .proof}
######Proof
Given $T$ of type T and $T \to 0$, we know $T$ is type A, and therefore there is exactly one map $T \to T$. Hence $T \to 0 \to T$ is the identity, and of course so is $0 \to T \to 0$. So $T$ is initial. 
=--

+-- {: .un_cor}
######Corollary
The full subcategory of objects of type T is closed under products, coproducts, subobjects, and quotient objects.
=--

+-- {: .proof}
######Proof
Closure under products and subobjects is immediate from the lemma that characterizes type T objects in terms of maps out of type A objects. Closure under quotients and coproducts follows from axiom 4. 
=--

+-- {: .un_thm}
######Theorem
The full subcategory of objects of type T is a pretopos. 
=--

+-- {: .proof}
######Proof
The previous proposition gives finite completeness, coproducts, and quotients of kernel pairs. One of the AT axioms is that a pushout along a mono is stable under pullback, and the initial object is stable under pullback in the category of T objects, because it is strict there. Thus coproducts are universal in the category of T objects; they are also disjoint by an earlier result, so the category of T objects is extensive. It is also effective regular by axiom 1, hence a pretopos. 
=-- 

## Splitting into type A and type T objects 

In this section we show that every AT category $C$ is the product of the abelian category $C_A$ of type A objects and the pretopos $C_T$ of type T objects. 

Let us first observe that the coreflector 

$$0 \times -: C \to C_A$$ 

is left exact (as all coreflectors are), and 

* Preserves the initial object (by axiom 2), 

* Preserves pushouts of kernel pairs, and pushouts of pairs of arrows one of which is monic (axiom 4), 

* And therefore also preserves coproducts. 

A functor between AT categories which is left exact and which preserves such classes of finite colimits may be called a **morphism of AT categories**. Hence the coreflector is a morphism of AT categories. 

Next let us observe that the subcategory $C_T \hookrightarrow C$ is _reflective_; the reflector is the functor $T$ defined above by means of a suitable pushout. The reflector clearly preserves any colimits that exist, and preserves pullbacks (by axiom 7), so 

$$T: C \to C_T$$ 

is also a morphism of AT categories. Therefore we have a morphism of AT categories 

$$F = \langle 0 \times -, T \rangle : C \to C_A \times C_T$$ 

and now we wish to prove, under a suitable additional axiom (also satisfied by every abelian category and every pretopos), that this is an equivalence. 

+-- {: .un_lem}
######Lemma
The functor $F$ is faithful. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof}
######Proof
The functor $F$ is left exact and therefore preserves kernels. By axiom 8, $F$ reflects isomorphisms. It follows immediately from these two facts that $F$ is faithful. 
=--

* **Remark:** With this result, Freyd's "first task" is complete: any AT category may be faithfully represented in a product of a pretopos and an abelian category. 

At this point we bring in axiom **AE** for its debut appearance. It may be helpful to consider that $T X$ is by definition the cokernel appearing in the exact sequence 

$$0 \times X \stackrel{\pi_2}{\to} X \to coker(\pi_2)$$ 

and that axiom AE asserts that this exact sequence splits (with splitting $\xi: coker(\pi_2) \to X$), making $X$ the coproduct of the end terms.  

+-- {: .un_prop}
######Proposition
The functor $F$ is full. 
=--

+-- {: .proof}
Suppose given maps $f: 0 \times X \to 0 \times Y$, $g: T X \to T Y$, and contemplate the diagram 
$$\array{
0 \times X & \stackrel{\pi_2}{\to} & X & \to & T X \\
f \downarrow & & & & \downarrow g \\
0 \times Y & \underset{\pi_2}{\to} & Y & \stackrel{\overset{\xi}{\leftarrow}}{\to} & T Y
}$$
Since $X = (0 \times X) + T X$, the two obvious arrows $0 \times X \to Y$, $T X \to Y$ combine to give an arrow $(f, g): X \to Y$. It is straightforward to check that $0 \times (f, g) = f$ (because the functor $0 \times -$ kills the type T summands) and that $T(f, g) = g$. 
=-- 

+-- {: .un_thm} 
######Theorem
The functor $F$ is an equivalence. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof}
######Proof
All that is left to check is that $F$ is essentially surjective, but this is clear because given a type A object $X$ and a type T object $Y$, we have $0 \times (X + Y) \cong X$ (use axiom 4 plus the fact that $0 \times Y \cong 0$), and 
$$T(X + Y) \cong T X + T Y \cong 0 + T Y \cong Y$$
which completes the proof. 
=--

This completes Freyd's "second task". 

## Topos-theoretic considerations 
 
In order to beef up the type T objects to a topos, Freyd imposes some extra structure on top of the AT axioms. Since it is now the topos axioms that are in the ascendant, I will christen these categories _TA categories_. 

Thus, a **TA category** is an AT category $C$ together with 

* Functions $P, E: Ob(C) \to Ob(C)$, 

* Functions $l, r: Ob(C) \to Mor(C)$, 

* An operation $\Lambda$ which assigns to each pair of morphisms $f: R \to Y$, $g: R \to X$ (where $R$ and $Y$ are assumed to be type T), a morphism 
$\Lambda(f, g): Y \to P X$, satisfying the following axioms: 

1. $\langle l X, r X \rangle: E X \to P X \times X$ is monic and $P X$, $T X$ are of type T, 

1. The composite of relations  
$$Y \stackrel{\Lambda(f, g)}{\to} P X \stackrel{(l X)^{op}}{\to} E X \stackrel{r X}{\to} X$$ 
is equal to 
$$Y \stackrel{f^{op}}{\to} R \stackrel{g}{\to} X,$$

1. If 
$$\array{
R & \stackrel{g}{\to} & E X \\
f \downarrow & & \downarrow l X \\
Y & \underset{h}{\to} & T X
}$$
is a pullback and $R$ is of type T, then $\Lambda(f, (r X) \circ g) = h$. 

Freyd: "Note that in the full category of type-T objects, P  yields
power-objects with $E$, $l$, $r$  naming the universal relations. (The third axiom provides the uniqueness condition.)" 

And: "In any abelian category the only type T object is the zero
object, which forces $P = E = 0$  for abelian categories."

And finally: "It's routine that both $0 \times -$ and $T$ preserve the new structure. We can now remove the existential from AE. Define $\xi: T X \to X$  as the image of $r X$. The third task is finished with:

1. For every $X$, $0 \times X \to X \stackrel{\xi}{\leftarrow} T X$ is a coproduct diagram." 

_This section is likely to be rewritten and cleaned up._
