A unital [[ring]] is an __integral domain__ (or simply domain) if it has no [[zero divisors]] (i.e. $a b = 0$ implies either $a=0$ or $b=0$). For example, the ring of integers, any [[skewfield]], the ring of global sections of the structure sheaf of any [[integral scheme]], an Ore extension of any domain.

In [[constructive mathematics]], one wants to phrase the condition as $a b \neq 0$ whenever $a \neq 0$ and $b \neq 0$, where $\neq$ is a tight [[apartness relation]] relative to which the ring operations are strongly extensional.  (Of course, if the underlying set of the ring has [[decidable equality]] ---as is true of $\mathbf{Z}$, $\mathbf{Q}$, $\mathbf{Z}/n$, finite fields, etc--- then none of this matters.)

An integral domain $R$ is an __Ore domain__ if the set of all nonzero elements is an [[Ore set]] in $R$. In that case the Ore localized ring is called the _Ore quotient ring_ of $R$.
