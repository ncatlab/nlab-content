## Idea ##
This page will collect a few notions and facts about representations of [[C-star algebras]] that are of importance to [[AQFT]]. Maybe some of those will be moved to their own page in the future...

In [[AQFT]] the observables are given by a [[causal net of algebras]], usually $C^*-$algebras. A concrete physical system corresponds to a [[state]] of the algebra of all observables, which leads, via the [[GNS-construction]], to a representation of this algebra on a concrete Hilbert-space. In this way the familiar picture of [[quantum mechanics]] reappears. The interpretation of states and their representation as modelling concrete physical systems means that a systematic study of all representation of a given algebra of observables is central to [[AQFT]].

###### Definition
A **representation** of a $C^*-algebra$ is a *-homomorphismus of the algebra to the [[bounded operators]] on a [[Hilbert space]].

Note that the _continuity_ is not an axiom, but a theorem, it follows from the algebraic properties.

###### Definition
A representation is **faithful** if its kernel is trivial.

###### Definition
Given two representations $\pi_1$ on $H_1$ and $\pi_2$ on $H_2$, if there is a [[unitary operator]] $U: H_1 \to H_2$ such that $U \pi_1 = \pi_2 U$ then the representations are **unitarily equivalent**. A linear map $U$ (not necessarily unitary) having this property is called an **intertwiner** or an **intertwining map**. If there is no nontrivial intertwiner the two representations $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$ are called **disjoint** (or totally / completley different).

Actually the term intertwiner is often used in a more general sense, see for example

* Wikipedia: [equivariant map](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertwiner) 

In the context of [[AQFT]] intertwiner is mostly used in the more specific sense as defined here.

From the physical viewpoint unitarily equivalent representations describe the same system, so that the classification of not unitarily equivalent representations is an important topic.
