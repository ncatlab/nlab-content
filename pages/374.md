## Idea
 {#Idea}

The notion of _topological space_ aims to axiomatize the idea of a _[[space]]_ as a collection of [[points]] that hang together ("[[cohesive topos|cohere]]") in a _[[continuous function|continuous]]_ way.

The proverbial motivating example is the surface of a [[torus]] and that of a mug: these are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] as topological spaces, because, abstractly, the surface of the mug can be deformed _continuously_ to become the standard torus: the continuous cohesion among the collections of points of the two surfaces is the same.

There is a slight generalization of the notion of topological space to that of a _[[locale]]_, which consists of dropping the assumption that all [[neighbourhoods]] are explicitly or even necessarily supported by points. In this form the definition is quite fundamental and can be naturally motivated from just pure [[logic]] -- as the formal dual of _[[frames]]_ --  as well as, and [[duality|dually]], from [[category theory]] in its variant as [[topos theory]] -- by the notion of _[[(0,1)-toposes]]_. 

Topological spaces are the objects studied in _[[topology]]_. 
By equipping them with a notion of [[weak equivalence]], namely of [[weak homotopy equivalence]], they turn out to support also _[[homotopy theory]]_. 

Topological spaces equipped with extra [[property]] and [[structure]] form the fundament of much of [[geometry]]. For instance a topological space locally isomorphic to a [[Cartesian space]] is a _[[manifold]]_. A topological space equipped with a notion of [[smooth functions]] into it is a [[diffeological space]]. The intersection of these two notions is that of a _[[smooth manifold]]_ on which [[differential geometry]] is based. And so on.


## Definitions

We present first the

and then a list of different

Finally we mention genuine

* [variants of the notion](#Variants).

### Standard definition
 {#StandardDefinition}

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A **topological space** is a [[set]] $X$ equipped with a set of [[subsets]] of $X$, called **[[open sets]]**, which are closed under 

1. finite [[intersections]] 
1. arbitrary [[unions]].  

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

The word 'topology' sometimes means the [[topology|study of topological spaces]] but here it means the collection of open sets in a topological space. In particular, if someone says 'Let $T$ be a topology on $X$', then they mean 'Let $X$ be equipped with the structure of a topological space, and let $T$ be the collection of open sets in this space'.

=--


+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Since $X$ itself is the intersection of zero subsets, it is open, and since the [[empty set]] $\emptyset$ is the union of zero subsets, it is also open. Moreover, every open subset $U$ of $X$ contains the empty set and is contained in $X$

$$
  \emptyset \subset U \subset X
  \,,
$$

so that the topology of $X$ is determined by a [[poset of open subsets]] $Op(X)$ with [[bottom]] element $\bot = \emptyset$ and [[top]] element $\top = X$. 

Since by definition the elements in this [[poset]] are closed under finite [[meets]] (intersection) and arbitrary [[joins]] (unions), this poset of open subsets defining a topology is a _[[frame]]_, the _[[frame of opens]]_ of $X$.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A [[homomorphisms]] between topological spaces $f : X \to Y$ is a **[[continuous function]]**: 

a [[function]] $f:X\to Y$ of the underlying [[sets]] such that the [[preimage]] of every open set of $Y$ is an open set of $X$.

=--

Topological spaces with continuous maps between them form a [[category]], usually denoted _[[Top]]_.

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

The definition of [[continuous function]] $f : X \to Y$ is such that it induces a homomorphism of the corresponding [[frames of opens]] the other way around

$$
  Op(X) \leftarrow Op(Y) : f^{-1}
  \,.
$$

And this is not just a morphism of [[posets]] but even of [[frames]].

### Alternate equivalent definitions
 {#AlternateDefinitions}

There are many equivalent ways to define a topological space.  A non-exhaustive list follows:

* A set $X$ with a [[frame]] of open sets (as above).

* A set $X$ with a co-frame of [[closed sets]] (the complements of the open sets) satisfying dual axioms.

* A set $X$ with any collection of subsets whatsoever, to be thought of as a [[subbase]] for a topology.

* A pair $(X, int)$, where $int\colon P(X) \to P(X)$ is a [[lex functor|left exact]] [[comonad]] on the [[power set]] of $X$ (the "[[interior]] operator").  The open sets are exactly the fixed points of $int$.

* A pair $(X, cl)$ where $cl$ is a [[rex functor|right exact]] [[Moore closure]] operator satisfying axioms dual to those of $int$.  The closed sets are the fixed points of $cl$.

* A [[relational β-module]]; that is, a [[lax algebra]] of the [[monad]] $\beta$ of [[ultrafilters]] on the [[(1,2)-category]] [[Rel]] of sets and [[binary relations]].  More explicitly, this means a set $X$ together with a relation called "[[convergence]]" between ultrafilters and points satisfying certain axioms.  This exhibits it as a special sort of [[generalized multicategory]], and also as a special sort of [[pseudotopological space]].

* A set with a [[convergence relation]] between [[nets]] or [[filters]] (not just ultrafilters) and points, or even between transfinite [[sequences]] and points, satisfying appropriate axioms.


### Variations
 {#Variants}

The definition of topological space was a matter of some debate, especially about 100 years ago. Our definition is due to [[Bourbaki]], so may be called **Bourbaki spaces**.

For some purposes, including [[homotopy theory]], it is important to use [[nice topological spaces]] (such as [[sequential topological spaces]]) and/or a [[nice category of spaces]] (such as [[compactly generated spaces]]), or indeed to directly use a model of $\infty$-[[infinity-groupoid|groupoids]] (such as [[simplicial sets]]).

On the other hand, when doing [[topos theory]] or working in [[constructive mathematics]], it is often more appropriate to use [[locales]] than topological spaces.

Some applications to [[analysis]] require more general [[convergence spaces]] or other generalisations.
