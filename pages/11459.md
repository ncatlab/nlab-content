## Idea

The [[real-oriented cohomology theory]]-version of [[Morava E-theory]].

## References

ER-theory was constructed in 

* {#Kriz01} [[Igor Kriz]], _Real-oriented homotopy theory and an analogue of the Adams-Novikov spectral sequence_, Topology 40 (2001) 317-399 ([pdf](http://www.math.rochester.edu/people/faculty/doug/otherpapers/hukriz.pdf))

based on Araki's discussion of [[BPR-theory]].

Some relations to versions [[tmf]] are discussed in
