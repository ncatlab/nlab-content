## Idea

The concept of a  [[homotopy type]] ([[homotopy n-type]]) all whose [[homotopy groups]] are [[finite groups]] does not have an established name. Sometimes it is called _$\pi$-finiteness_. In the context of [[groupoid cardinality]] "tameness" is used. In [[homological algebra]] "of [[finite type]]" is used, which in [[homotopy theory]] however badly clashes with the concept of [[finite homotopy type]] which is crucially different from _homotopy type with finite homotopy groups_.

## Properties

###### Proposition

[[∞Grpd]] is a [[coherent (∞,1)-topos]] and a [[locally coherent (∞,1)-topos]]. An [[object]] $X$, hence an [[∞-groupoid]], is an [[n-coherent object]] precisely if all its [[homotopy groups]] in degree $k \leq n$ are [[finite set|finite]]. Hence the fully coherent objects here are the homotopy types with finite homotopy groups.
