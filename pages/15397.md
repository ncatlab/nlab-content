###### Definition

A **[[pseudogroup]]** (also called transformation pseudogroup) on a [[topological space]] (or [[locale]]) $X$ is a [[groupoid]] $G$ each of whose [[objects]] is an [[open subset]] of $X$, and whose [[morphisms]] are [[homeomorphisms]] between such open sets, satisfying the following conditions:

* The objects [[cover]] $X$. (Equivalently, in light of the last axiom, every open set of $X$ is an object of $G$.)
* If $g: V \to W$ belongs to $G$ and $U \subseteq V$ is an open set, then the restriction $g|_U: U \to g(U)$ belongs to $G$. (Equivalently, in light of the other axioms, every inclusion map $id|_U: U \to V$ belongs to $G$.)
* ([[sheaf]] property) If $g: U \to V$ is a homeomorphism and if there is a covering $U_\alpha$ of $U$ such that the restrictions $g|_{U_\alpha}: U_\alpha \to g(U_\alpha)$ are morphisms of $G$, then $g$ is also morphism of $G$.

###### Example

Commonly used choices for $X$ in def. \ref{Pseudogroup} include 

* the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ (for real manifolds)

* the [[complex plane]] $\mathbb{C}^n$ (for [[complex manifolds]])

* the half-space $H^n = \{(x_1, \ldots, x_n) \in \mathbb{R}^n: x_1 \geq 0\}$ (for [[manifolds with boundary]])

* the $n$-[[cube]] $I^n = [0, 1]^n$.

More generally, an abstract pseudogroup is a sub-[[inverse semigroup]] of the inverse semigroup of partial bijections of a set (or, even more generally, local automorphisms of an object in more general context).

## Properties

### Relation to effective étale stacks

In the language of [[topological groupoids]]/[[Lie groupoids]] and their associated [[geometric stacks]], pseudogroups correspond to [[effective Lie groupoid|effective]] [[étale stacks]].  ([Lawson-Lenz 11](#LawsonLenz11), [Carchedi 12, section 2](#Carchedi12)).
