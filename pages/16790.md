## Idea

The [[spacetime]] geometry of a [[black hole]] or [[black brane]] close to the [[horizon]] is called its _near-horizon geometry_. Accordingly, the geometry far from the horizon might be called its _far-horizon geometry_. One commonly says that the black hole/brane solution _interpolates_ between its near and far horizon geometry.

## Properties

### Near-horizon geometry

For [[black brane|black]] [[M-branes]] ([[black branes]] in [[11-dimensional supergravity]]) of [[dimension]] $p+1$ that preserve some [[supersymmetry]], the near horizon geometry is always a [[Cartesian product]] of an [[anti-de Sitter spacetime]] $AdS_{p+2}$ with a [[compact topological space|compact]] [[Einstein manifold]] $X_{11-(p+2)}$; 

$$
  Ads_{p+2} \times X_{d-(p+2)}
  \,;
$$

while for [[black brane|black]] [[D-branes]] and [[NS5-branes]] in [[type II supergravity]] the near horizon geometry is [[conformal transformation|conformal]] to a geometry of this form $AdS_{p+2} \times X_{d-(p+2)}$ (see [AFFHS 98, section 2](#AFFHS98)).

### Far-horizon geometry

In contrast, the "far-horizon geometry" of all those [[black branes]] whose near horizon geometry is $AdS_{p+2} \times X_{d-(p+2)}$ (i.e. actual [[anti-de Sitter spacetime]] without conformal factor) is of the form 

$$
  \mathbb{R}^{p,1} \times C\left(X_{d-(p+2)}\right)
  \,,
$$

where $\mathbb{R}^{p,1}$ is [[Minkowski spacetime]] (the brane [[worldvolume]]) and $C(X_{d-(p+2)})$ is the [[metric cone]] over $X_{d-(p+2)}$ (see [AFFHS 98, section 3](#AFFHS98)). Since this "far-horizon limit" is still a solution to the [[supergravity]] [[equations of motion]] away from the tip of the cone, it may in itself be regarded as a "[[cone brane]]"-solution (see [AFFHS 98, section 3.1](#AFFHS98)).

If $X_{d-(p+2)}$ is a smooth [[quotient space]] by the [[action]] of a [[finite subgroup of SU(2)]], then the corresponding [[cone brane]] is a brane "at an [[ADE-singularity]]".

Examples and applications of such cone branes, in the context of [[M-theory on G2-manifolds]], are discussed in [Atiyah-Witten 01](#AtiyahWitten01).
