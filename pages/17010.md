## Idea

_Stereographic projection_ is the name for a specific [[homeomorphism]] (for any $n \in \mathbb{N}$) from the [[Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ to the [[n-sphere]] $S^n$ with one point $p \in S^n$ removed

$$
  \mathbb{R}^n \simeq S^n \backslash p
  \,.
$$

Namely one thinks of both the $n$-sphere as well as the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$ as [[topological subspaces]] of $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ in a standard way, such that they [[intersection|intersect]] in the [[equator]] of the $n$-sphere. Taking then then point $p \in S^n$ to be one of the resulting "poles", hence at maximal distance form the equatorial hyperplane, one considers the relation

"The point $x \in S^n \backslash p$ and $y \in \mathbb{R}^n$ sit on a straight line with the point $p$."

This relation is the "stereographic projection" from the $n$-sphere without that point to the $n$-plane, and vice versa. It establishes a [[bijection]] between $S^n \backslash p$ and $\mathbb{R}^n$. Inspection shows that this bijection is a [[homeomorphism]].

If one applies stereographic projection to _both_ possible poles $p_+, p_- \in S^n$ of the sphere given a fixed equatorial plane, then one obtains two different [[homeomorphisms]]

$$
  \left\{
     \mathbb{R}^n 
       \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi_i}{\longrightarrow}
     S^n\backslash \{p_i\}
  \right\}_{i \in \{+,-\}}
  \,.
$$

This constitutes an [[atlas]] that exhibits the [[n-sphere]] as a [[topological manifold]], in fact a [[differentiable manifold]] and in fact as a [[smooth manifold]]. 

Moreover, for $n = 2$ and with $\mathbb{R}^2 \simeq_{\mathbb{R}} \mathbb{C}$ regarded as the [[complex plane]], then this atlas realizes the [[2-sphere]] as a [[complex manifold]]: the _[[Riemann sphere]]_.

## Definition



Consider a (unit, say) [[sphere]] $S^n \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, and a point $p\in S^n$, considered as a [[vector]] in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. Let $W\subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ be the [[linear subspace]] that is the [[orthogonal complement]] to the [[linear span]] $span\{v\}$. There is a [[homeomorphism]]

$$
  \sigma \;\colon\; S^n\setminus \{v\} \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} W
$$

given by sending a point $p\in S^n\setminus \{v\}$ to the point in $W$ that is the intersection of the line through $v$ and $p$ with $W$.

More concretely:

We consider the ambient canonicall [[coordinates]] of $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, in terms of which the $n$-sphere is the [[topological subspace]] whose underlying [[subset]] is 

$$
  S^n 
  =
  \left\{
     x = (x_1, \cdots, x_{n+1})  \in \mathbb{R}^{n+1}
     \,\vert\,
     \underoverset{i = 1}{n+1}{\sum} (x_i)^2 = 1
  \right\}
  \;\subset\;
  \mathbb{R}^{n+1}
  \,.
$$

Without restriction, we may identify the given pole point with

$$
  p = (1,0,\ldots,0)
$$

hence the coresponding equatorial hyperplane with 

$$
  W 
    = 
  \left\{
    x = (x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_{n+1}) \in \mathbb{R}^{n+1}
    \,\vert\,
    x_1 = 0
  \right\}
  \,.
$$

Proposition:

A point $x \in S^{n} \backslash p \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ and a point $y \in W \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ sit on a line with the point $p = (1,0, \cdots, 0)$ precisely if

$$
  (y_1, \cdots, y_{n+1}) = \frac{1}{x_1-1}(0, x_2, \cdots , x_{n+1} )
$$

In one direction, consider the stereographic projection

$$
  \sigma
    \;\colon\;
  \mathbb{R}^{n+1} \backslash (1,0,\cdots, 0)
    \longrightarrow
  \mathbb{R}^n
   = 
  \{x \in \mathbb{R}^{n.1} \,\vert\, x_1 = 0 \}
$$

of the entire ambient space onto the equatorial plane, given by mapping a point $x$ to the unique point $y$ on the equatorial hyperplane such that the points $p$, $x$ any $y$ sit on the same straight line. This condition means that there exists $d \in \mathbb{R}$ such that

$$
  p +  d(x-p) = y
$$

and since the only condition on $y$ is that $y_1 = 0$ this implies that 

$$ 
  p_1 + d(x_1-p_1) = 0 
  \,.
$$

This has a unique solution for $d$ given by

$$ 
  d = 1/(1-x_1)
$$

and hence it follow that

$$
  \sigma(x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_{n+1}) 
    = 
  \frac{1}{1-x_1}(0,x_2, \cdots, x_n).
$$

This is clearly a [[continuous function]] $\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \backslash (1,0,\cdots 0) \to \mathbb{R}^{n}$ and since the topology on $S^n\backslash p$ is the [[subspace topology]] under the canonical embedding $S^n \backslash p \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1} \backslash p$ is follows that the restiction

$$
  \sigma\vert_{S^n \backslash p}
    \;\colon\;
  S^n\backslash p 
    \longrightarrow
  \mathbb{R}^n
$$

is itself a [[continuous function]] (because its pre-images are the restrictions of the pre-images of $\sigma$ to $S^n\backslash p$).


## Generalizations

More generally, one may take for $W$ any _[[affine space|affine]]_ subspace of $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ normal to $span\{v\}$ and not containing $v$. For instance one option is to take $W$ to be the tangent space to $S^n$ at $-v$, embedded as a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$.

(see e.g. [Cook-Crabb 93, section 1](#CookCrabb93))

## Properties

### One-point compactification

The inverse map $\sigma^{-1}$ exhibits $S^n$ as the [[one-point compactification]] of $W$.


### Extra geometric structure

In most cases of interest one is doing [[geometry]] using stereographic projection, so the sphere and the subspace $W$ are equipped with extra structure. Taking the explicit case above ($v=(1,0,\ldots,0)$), as the formula is so simple, some structures are automatically preserved, for instance:

* [[conformal structure]]

* [[orthogonal group|orthogonal]] [[group action]] fixing $v,-v$ pointwise (note that these two points are sent to "$\infty$" and $0$, respectively, under $\sigma$)
