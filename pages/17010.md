## Idea

_Stereographic projection_ is the name for a specific [[chart]] on a [[sphere]] for the [[complement]] of a [[point]].

## Definition

Consider a (unit, say) [[sphere]] $S^n \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, and a point $v\in S^n$, considered as a vector in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. Let $W\subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ be the linear [[subspace]] that is the [[orthogonal complement]] to the [[linear span]] $span\{v\}$. There is a [[homeomorphism]]

$$
  \sigma \;\colon\; S^n\setminus \{v\} \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} W
$$

given by sending a point $p\in S^n\setminus \{v\}$ to the point in $W$ that is the intersection of the line through $v$ and $p$ with $W$.

The inverse map $\sigma^{-1}$ exhibits $S^n$ as the [[one-point compactification]] of $W$.

In the case that $v=(1,0,\ldots,0)$, we have the simple formula
$$
\sigma(z,\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{z-1}\mathbf{x}.
$$
