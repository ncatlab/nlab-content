## Idea

_Stereographic projection_ is the name for a specific [[chart]] on a [[sphere]] for the complement of a point.

## Definition

Consider a (unit, say) sphere $S^n \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, and a point $v\in S^n$, considered as a vector in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. Let $W\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be the linear [[subspace]] that is the orthogonal complement to the subspace $span\{v\}$. There is an isomorphism 
$$
\sigma\colon S^n\setminus \{v\} \to W
$$
given by sending a point $p\in S^n\setminus \{v\}$ to the point in $W$ that is the intersection of the line through $v$ and $p$ and $W$.

The inverse map displays $S^n$ as the [[one-point compactification]] of $W$.

In the case that $v=(1,0,\ldots,0)$, we have the simple formula
$$
\sigma(z,\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{z-1}\mathbf{x}.
$$
