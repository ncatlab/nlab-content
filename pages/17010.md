## Idea

_Stereographic projection_ is the name for a specific [[homeomorphism]] (for any $n \in \mathbb{N}$) from the [[Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ to the [[n-sphere]] $S^n$ with one point $p \in S^n$ removed

$$
  \mathbb{R}^n \simeq S^n \backslash p
  \,.
$$

Namely one thinks of both the $n$-sphere as well as the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$ as [[topological subspaces]] of $\mathbb{R}^n$, such that they [[intersection|intersect]] at the [[equator]] of the sphere. Take then then point $p \in S^n$ to be one of the resulting "poles", hence a point on the sphere at maximal distance form the equatorial hyperplane. Then consider the relation

"$x \in S^n \backslash p$ and $y \in \mathbb{R}^n$ sit on a straight line with the point $p$."

This relation is the "stereographic projection". It establishes a [[bijection]] between $S^n \backslash p$ and $\mathbb{R}^n$. Inspection shows that this bijection is a [[homeomorphism]].

If one applies stereographic projection to _both_ possible poles $p_+, p_- \in S^n$ of the sphere given a fixed equatorial plane, then one obtains two different [[homeomorphisms]]

$$
  \left\{
     \mathbb{R}^n 
       \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi_i}{\longrightarrow}
     S^n\backslash \{p_i\}
  \right\}_{i \in \{+,-\}}
  \,.
$$

This constitutes an [[atlas]] that exhibits the [[n-sphere]] as a [[smooth manifold]]. 

## Definition

Consider a (unit, say) [[sphere]] $S^n \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, and a point $v\in S^n$, considered as a vector in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. Let $W\subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ be the linear [[subspace]] that is the [[orthogonal complement]] to the [[linear span]] $span\{v\}$. There is a [[homeomorphism]]

$$
  \sigma \;\colon\; S^n\setminus \{v\} \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} W
$$

given by sending a point $p\in S^n\setminus \{v\}$ to the point in $W$ that is the intersection of the line through $v$ and $p$ with $W$.


The inverse map $\sigma^{-1}$ exhibits $S^n$ as the [[one-point compactification]] of $W$.

In the case that $v=(1,0,\ldots,0)$, then $W = \{0\}\oplus \mathbb{R}^n$ and we have the simple formula
$$
\sigma(z,\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{z-1}(0,\mathbf{x}).
$$


More generally, one may take for $W$ any _[[affine space|affine]]_ subspace of $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ normal to $span\{v\}$ and not containing $v$. For instance one option is to take $W$ to be the tangent space to $S^n$ at $-v$, embedded as a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$.

(see e.g. [Cook-Crabb 93, section 1](#CookCrabb93))

## Extra structure

In most cases of interest one is doing [[geometry]] using stereographic projection, so the sphere and the subspace $W$ are equipped with extra structure. Taking the explicit case above ($v=(1,0,\ldots,0)$), as the formula is so simple, some structures are automatically preserved, for instance:

* [[conformal structure]]
* [[orthogonal group|orthogonal]] [[group action]] fixing $v,-v$ pointwise (note that these two points are sent to "$\infty$" and $0$, respectively, under $\sigma$)
