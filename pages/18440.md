## Definition

A ring $R$ of characteristic $p$ is said to be _perfect_ if the [[Frobenius map]] $\phi: R \to R$ is an [[isomorphism]]. If instead $\phi$ is merely assumed to be [[surjective]], $R$ is said to be _semiperfect_.

## Perfections

For a ring $R$ of characteristic $p$, let $R_{perf} = \underset{\rightarrow}{lim}_{\phi} R$ and $R^{perf} = \underset{\leftarrow}{lim}_{\phi} R$

Both $R_{perf}$ and $R^{perf}$ are perfect.  The canonical map $R\to R_{perf}$ (respectively, $R^{perf} \to R$) is universal for maps _into_ (respectively, _from_) perfect rings.  Moreover, the projection $R^{perf} \to R$ is surjective exactly when $R$ is semiperfect.
