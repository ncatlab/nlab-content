## Idea

A premonoidal category is a generalisation of a [[monoidal category]], applied by [[John Power]] and his collaborators to [[denotational semantics]] in [[computer science]].

Recall that a [[bifunctor]] from $C$ and $D$ to $E$ (for $C,D,E$ [[categories]]) is simply a [[functor]] to $E$ from the [[product category]] $C \times D$.  We can think of this as an operation which is 'jointly functorial'.  But just as a [[function]] to $X$ from $Y$ and $Z$ (for $X,Y,Z$ [[topological spaces]]) may be [[continuous map|continuous]] in each variable yet not [[jointly continuous function|jointly continuous]] (continuous from the [[Tychonoff product]] $Y \times Z$), so an operation between categories can be functorial in each variable separately yet not jointly functorial.

Recall that a [[monoidal category]] is a [[category]] $C$ equipped with a bifunctor $C \times C \to C$ (equipped with [[extra structure]] such as the [[associator]]).  Similarly, a premonoidal category is a category equipped with an operation $C \times C \to C$, which is (at least) a [[function]] on [[objects]] as shown, but one which is functorial only in each variable separately.


## Definition

A __binoidal category__ is a [[category]] $C$ equipped with

*  for each pair $x,y$ of [[objects]] of $C$, an object $x \otimes y$;
*  for each object $x$ a [[functor]] $x \rtimes -$ whose action on objects sends $y$ to $x \otimes y$
*  for each object $x$ a [[functor]] $- \ltimes x$ whose action on objects sends $y$ to $y \otimes x$

A [[morphism]] $f\colon x \to y$ in a binoidal category is __central__ if, for every morphism $f'\colon x' \to y'$, the diagrams
$$ \array {
   x \otimes x'                      & \overset{x \rtimes f'}\to  & x \otimes y' \\
   \mathllap{f \ltimes x'}\downarrow &                            & \downarrow\mathrlap{f \ltimes y'} \\
   y \otimes x'                      & \underset{y \rtimes f'}\to & y \otimes y' \\
   } $$
and
$$ \array {
   x' \otimes x                      & \overset{x' \rtimes f}\to  & x' \otimes y \\
   \mathllap{f' \ltimes x}\downarrow &                            & \downarrow\mathrlap{f' \ltimes y} \\
   y' \otimes x                      & \underset{y' \rtimes f}\to & y' \otimes y \\
   } $$
commute.  In this case, we denote the common composites $f \otimes f'\colon x \otimes x' \to y \otimes y'$ and $f' \otimes f\colon x' \otimes x \to y' \otimes y$.

A __premonoidal category__ is a binoidal category equipped with:

*  an object $I$;
*  for each triple $x,y,z$ of objects, a central [[isomorphism]] $\alpha_{x,y,z}\colon (x \otimes y) \otimes z \to x \otimes (y \otimes z)$; and
*  for each object $x$, central isomorphisms $\lambda_x\colon x \otimes I \to x$ and $\rho_x\colon I \otimes x \to x$;

such that the following conditions hold.

*  all possible [[natural transformation|naturality squares]] for $\alpha$, $\lambda$, and $\rho$ (which make sense since we have central morphisms) commute.  Note that when written out explicitly in terms of the functors $x\rtimes -$ and $-\ltimes x$, we need three different naturality squares for $\alpha$.  (But it is possible to rephrase $\alpha$ as a single natural transformation using the slick version below.)
*  the pentagon law holds for $\alpha$, as in a [[monoidal category]].
*  the triangle law holds for $\alpha$, $\lambda$, and $\rho$, as in a monoidal category.

A __strict premonoidal category__ is a monoidal category in which $(x \otimes y) \otimes z = x \otimes (y \otimes z)$, $x \otimes I = x$, and $I \otimes x = x$, and in which $\alpha_{x,y,z}$, $\lambda_x$, and $\rho_x$ are all [[identity morphisms]].  (We need the underlying category $C$ to be a [[strict category]] for this to make sense.)

Similarly, a **symmetric premonoidal category** is a premonoidal category equipped with a central natural isomorphism $x\otimes y \cong y\otimes x$ (as for $\alpha$, there are two naturality squares unless we use the slick approach), satisfying the usual axioms of a symmetry.


## Slick version

As a [[strict monoidal category]] is a [[monoid]] in the [[cartesian monoidal category]] [[Cat]], so a premonoidal category is a monoid in another [[symmetric monoidal category]] whose underlying category is also $Cat$.

Given [[categories]] $C,D$ and [[functors]] $F,G\colon C \to D$, a (*not* necessarily natural) __transformation__ from $F$ to $G$ consists of, for each object $x$ of $C$, a morphism from $F(x)$ to $G(x)$ in $D$.  (So a [[natural transformation]] is a transformation that satisfies an [[extra property]].)  We can compose transformations using [[vertical composition]] (but *not* [[horizontal composition]]).

Given categories $C,D$, let $C \Rightarrow D$ be the category whose objects are functors from $C$ to $D$ and whose morphisms are transformations between these functors.  This makes $Cat$ into a [[closed category]].  We can then define a [[tensor product]] by a [[universal property]] and make $Cat$ into a [[monoidal category]] $(Cat,\otimes)$ which is in fact symmetric.

Then a strict premonoidal category is precisely a [[monoid object]] in $(Cat,\otimes)$.

It may be possible to weaken the above make $(Cat,\otimes)$ a [[symmetric monoidal 2-category]], in which a monoid object is precisely a premonoidal category, but if so, nobody seems to have written this up yet.  It is possible, however, to describe part of the structure of a non-strict premonoidal category in terms of $(Cat,\otimes)$.  For instance, a binoidal structure on $C$ is precisely a functor $C\otimes C \to C$, and the naturality of the associator $\alpha$ can be expressed by saying that it is a natural transformation (with central components) between functors $C\otimes C\otimes C \to C$.


## Examples

* Every [[monoidal category]] is a premonoidal category.

* If $T$ is a [[strong monad]] on a monoidal category $C$, then the [[Kleisli category]] $C_T$ of $T$ inherits a premonoidal structure, such that the functor $C\to C_T$ is a strict premonoidal functor.  This premonoidal structure is only a monoidal structure if $T$ is a [[commutative monad]].


## Properties

The central morphisms of a premonoidal category $C$ form a [[subcategory]] $Z(C)$, called the __centre__ of $C$, which is a [[monoidal category]].  This may define an [[adjoint functor]] to the inclusion $MonCat \hookrightarrow PreMonCat$ (I haven\'t actually checked this).

In the same way that a (strict) monoidal category can be identified with a (strict) [[2-category]] with one object, a strict premonoidal category can be identified with a [[sesquicategory]] with one object.  In fact, a sesquicategory is precisely a category [[enriched category|enriched]] over the monoidal category $(Cat,\otimes)$ described above.
