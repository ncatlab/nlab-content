## Idea

The term _beable_ was proposed in ([Bell 75](#Bell75)) as a replacement in [[quantum physics]] of the traditional term _[[observable]]_. While the latter is typically given a precise mathematical meaning which does express the way in which the [[physical system]] may be, the word "observable" alludes to the complicated and subtle issue of something (a [[quantum measurement]] device) or even somebody (a concious experimentor) "observing" these ways of the system to be. The point of the term "beable" is to help conceptually cleanly separate the [[being]] of quantum systems from whatever it means to observe them.

In ([Bell 75](#Bell75)) to further justify this recourse is made to [[Niels Bohr]]'s expressed view that whatever [[quantum physics]] really is, it must be possible to communicate statements about it in terms of classical [[logic]]. (This same argument was much later used to motivate [[Bohr toposes]].)

In practice of theoretical physics most everytime one writes "observable" it should, by this logic, rather be "beable". While this might be reasonable, as a convention of conversation it has not been picked up.
