## Idea

A _derived smooth manifold_ is the generalization of a [[smooth manifold]] in [[derived differential geometry]]: the [[derived geometry]] over the [[Lawvere theory]] for [[smooth algebra]]s ($C^\infty$-rings):

it is a [[structured (∞,1)-topos]] whose [[structure sheaf]] of functions is a [[smooth (∞,1)-algebra]].


## Motivation: correction of limits

According to the general logic of [[derived geometry]], passing from [[smooth manifold]]s to _derived smooth manifold_ serves to _correct_ certain [[limit]]s that do exist in [[Diff]] but do not have the correct [[cohomology|cohomological behaviour]]. This concerns notably [[pullback]]s along [[smooth function]]s that are not [[transversal map]]s.


### Pontrjagin-Thom construction

For $X$ a [[compact space|compact]] [[smooth manifold]], by the [[Pontrjagin-Thom construction]] there is a [[smooth function]] $f : S^n \to M O$ from an $n$-sphere to the [[Thom spectrum]] such that if chosen [[transversal map|transversal]] to the zero-[[section]] $B \hookrightarrow M O$ the [[pullback]] $f^* B$

$$
  \array{
     f^* B &\to& B
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     S^n &\stackrel{f}{\to}& M O
  }
$$

is a manifold cobordant to $X$, so that $[X] \simeq [f^* B]$ in the [[cobordism ring]] $\Omega$.

By using derived smooth manifolds instead of ordinary smooth manifolds here, the condition that $f$ be transversal to $B$ could be dropped.

## Definition

The following definition characterizes the design criterion for derived smooth manifolds as being objects for which homotopy-intersections 

$$
  A \cap_X B := A \times_X^h B
$$

preserve the [[cup product]] in the [[cobordism ring]]

$$
  [A] \smile [B] \simeq [A \cap_X B]
  \,.
$$

###### Definition

We say an [[(∞,1)-category]] $C$ supports **derived cup products for cobordisms** if

* it is equipped with a [[full and faithful functor]]

  $$
    i : Diff \hookrightarrow C
  $$

  embedding the category of [[smooth manifold]]s into it;

* for any two submanifolds $A \to X \leftarrow B$ (transversal or not) the [[(∞,1)-pullback]] 

  $$
    A \cap_X B := i(A) \times_{i(X)} i(B)
  $$

  exists in $C$;

* if $A \to X \leftarrow B$ happen to be [[transverse map]]s then

  $$
    i(A \times_X B) \simeq i(A) \times_{i(X)} i(B)
    \,,
  $$

  with the image under $i$ of the ordinary [[pullback]] in [[Diff]] on the left;

* $i$ preserves the [[terminal object]];

* (...nice interaction with underlying topological spaces...)

* for each $X \in Diff$ there is a _derived cobordism ring_
  $\Omega(X)$ such that ...

* for any submanifolds $A \to X \leftarrow B$ we have

  $$
    [A] \smile [B] = [A \cap_X B]  
  $$

  in $\Omega(X)$
