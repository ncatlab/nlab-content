# Set-level foundations

## Definition

By **set-level foundations** we mean any [[foundation of mathematics]] in which *all* the basic objects are, or behave like, [[sets]].  This includes:

* axiomatic [[set theory]] of all sorts:
  * [[material set theory]]
  * [[structural set theory]]
* [[extensional type theory]], including both
  * definitionally extensional type theory
  * propositionally/typally extensional type theory

By contrast, "set-level foundations" does *not* include foundations of mathematics in which there are basic objects of higher [[h-level]], which behave like [[groupoids]] or [[infinity-groupoids]] (or even [[categories]] or [[infinity-categories]]).  Thus, it excludes:

* [[homotopy type theory]] of all sorts:
  * [[Book HoTT]]
  * [[cubical type theory]]
  * [[higher observational type theory]]
* More generally, [[intensional type theory]], in which no types of higher h-level can be shown to exist, but neither can all types be shown to be [[h-sets]].
