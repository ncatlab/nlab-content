## Definition

For $(X, \pi)$ a [[Poisson manifold]], a **symplectic realization** of it is a [[symplectic manifold]] $(Y, \omega)$ and a Poisson map $(Y, \omega) \to (X, \pi)$ such that $Y \to X$ is a   [[surjective submersion]] $Y \to X$.

## Properties

### Solution in terms of symplectic groupoids

For any [[symplectic groupoid]] $\Sigma$ with base a [[Poisson manifold]] $P$ the target map is a symplectic realization of $P$ and  the source map is a symplectic realization  of the opposite structure. Thus $\Sigma$ with its symplectic structure may be regarded as a desingularization of  $P$ with its Poisson structure. Since the [[symplectic groupoid]] is the [[Lie integration]] of the [[Poisson Lie algebroid]] of the Poisson manifold, symplectic realization has been reduced to a problem in [[Lie theory]].
