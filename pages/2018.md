A __noetherian ring__ is a [[ring]] for which every ascending chain of its [[ideal]]s stabilizes. 

A dual condition is artinian: an __artinian ring__ is a ring satisfying the descending chain condition on ideals. The symmetry is broken if one considers unital rings: every unital artinian ring is noetherian. 

Cf. [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noetherian_ring) and [[noetherian object]].
