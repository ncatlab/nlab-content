A multiset is like a [[set]], just allowing that the elements have multiplicities. Thus multiset $\{1,1,2\}$ differs from the multiset $\{1,2\}$. **Multiset** can be defined as a set $A$ together with a function **multiplicity** $A\to \mathbb{N}$ into the set of (nonzero) natural numbers. 

Multisets are useful in combinatorics. See [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiset).
