## Statement ##

Let $B$ be the unit ball of a separable [[Hilbert space]] over $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$. Then the scalar product, $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle : B \times B \to \mathbb{C}$ has the following special property:

###### Theorem

There exist sequences $f_n,g_n: B \to \mathbb{C}$ of norm continuous functions, such that
* $\langle x, y \rangle = \sum_n f_n(x) g_n(y)$ for all $x, y \in B$
* $\sum_n \sup_B \left| f_n \right| \sup_B \left| g_n \right| &lt; \infty$
=--

In other words, $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$, as a function of two variables, is an element of the [[tensor product of Banach spaces|projective tensor product]] $C(B) \hat \otimes C(B)$. Its projective tensor norm is known as the Grothendieck's constant. The precise value of this constant is different in the real and complex case, and neither one is known exactly.
