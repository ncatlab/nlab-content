## Idea

Traditionally the [[perturbation series]]/[[scattering amplitudes]] of a [[quantum field theory]] are defined, given an [[action functional]]/[[local Lagrangian]], by applying the _[[Feynman rules]]_ to the monomial terms in the Lagrangian and deriving from that (via "[[second quantization]]") a rule for how to weight each [[Feynman diagram]] by a [[probability amplitude]].

In what is called the _worldline formalism_ of [[quantum field theory]] this assignment is obtained instead more conceptually as the [[correlators]]/[[n-point functions]] of a 1-dimensional QFT that lives on the graphs, namely the [[worldline]] theory (usually a [[sigma-model]] in the given [[target|target]] [[spacetime]]) of the [[particles]] that are the quanta of the [[field (physics)|fields]] in the field theory.

Mathematically the key step here is a [[Mellin transform]] -- introducing a "[[Schwinger parameter]]" -- which turns the [[partition function]] of a worldline theory, schematically of the form $t \mapsto Tr\, \exp(-t H)$ (for $H$ the [[Hamiltonian]]/[[wave operator]]) into the [[zeta function regularization|zeta regulated]] [[Feynman propagator]]

$$ 
  \hat \zeta_H(s)  = \int_0^\infty Tr_{reg} \exp(-t H) t^{s-1} d t = Tr_{reg} H^{-s}
  \,.
$$

This worldline formalism is equivalent to the traditional formulation. It has the conceptual advantage that it expresses the QFT (in [[perturbation theory]]) more manifestly as a [[second quantization]] of its particle content given explicitly of the [[superposition]] of all 1-particle processes.

The worldline formulation of QFT has an evident generalization to higher dimensional [[worldvolumes]]: in direct analogy one can consider summing the [[correlators]]/[[n-point functions]] over [[worldvolume]] [[theory (physics)|theories]] of "higher dimensional particles" ("[[branes]]") over all possible worldvolume geometries. Indeed, for 2-[[dimensional]] branes this is precisely the way in which [[perturbative string theory]] is defined: the [[string scattering amplitudes]] are given by the analogous "worldsheet formalism" known as the [[string perturbation series]] as the sum over all surfaces of the [[correlators]]/[[n-point functions]] of of a 2d [[SCFT]] of central charge 15.

Indeed, after decades of [[Feynman rules]], the worldline formalism for QFT was found only _via_ [[string theory]] in ([Bern-Kosower 91](#BernKosower91)), by looking at the point particle limit of [[string scattering amplitudes]]. Then ([Strassler 92](#Strassler92), [Strassler 93](#Strassler93)) observed that generally the worldline formlism is obtained from the correlators of the 1d QFT of [[relativistic particles]] on their [[worldline]].
