## Idea

In [[chromatic homotopy theory]] the _redshift conjecture_ is a [[conjecture]] about the nature of the [[algebraic K-theory]] spectrum $K(R)$ of an [[E-infinity ring]] $R$. Roughly, its say that $K(R)$ has [[chromatic level]] one higher than $R$ has.

The conjecture was originally formulated by [[John Rognes]] ([Rognes 99](#Rognes99), [Rognes 00](#Rognes00)).

## References

The conjecture originates with

Previous work motivating the conjecture was the study of the [[algebraic K-theory]] $K(KU)$ of the [[complex K-theory spectrum]] $KU$ (also thought of as the [[classifying space]] for [[BDR 2-vector bundles]]) in 

* {#BaasDundasRognes07} [[Nils Baas]], [[Bjørn Dundas]], [[Birgit Richter]], [[John Rognes]], _Ring completion of rig categories_ ([arXiv:0706.0531](http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.0531))

which was motivated by the desire to turn [[topological K-theory]] into "a form of" [[elliptic cohomology]] by a kind of [[categorification]].
