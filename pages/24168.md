## Definition ##

A __univalent type theory__ is a [[dependent type theory]] with [[universes]] and [[identity types]] such that all universes satisfy the [[univalence axiom]]. 

Univalent type theories usually have additional types such as the [[empty type]], the [[unit type]], the [[booleans]], and the [[interval type]].
