In a [[category]] $C$ [[enriched category|enriched over]] [[Top]] or a similar category "of spaces" (such as [[SSet]] or [[Infinity-Grpd]]), the hom-object $C(X,Y)$ for any two [[object]]s $X$ and $Y$ is called the **hom-space**. 

For enrichement in [[Set]] this hom-space is an ordinary [[hom-set]].
