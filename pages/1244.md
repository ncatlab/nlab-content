Two entirely unrelated concepts in mathematics are called **torsion**

* the [[torsion subgroup]] of a group is the group of elements of finite order;

* the torsion of a connection on a tangent bundle is a measure for how the covariant derivative differs from the Lie bracket.

#Remark#

* Usually there is no risk of confusion, since both terms are used in very different areas of mathematics. _Except_ maybe for the following situation:

  * when a $U(1)$-gerbe on a manifold $X$ is used as the background field of a [[sigma-model]] for [[conformal field theory]], its curvature 3-form characterizes the torison -- in the differential geometric sense -- of a connection induced on the tangent space of $X$ from the coresponding [[2-spectral triple]]. At the same time, it is of interest whether the [[characteristic class]] of the gerbe, which is an element in $H^3(X, \mathbb{Z})$ is a torsion element in the sense of group theory. Authors in this area will often say sentences like "The gerbe is torsion." which may sound ambiguous for this reason. But if the author knows what a gerbe is, he or she almost surely means the group theoretic sense.
