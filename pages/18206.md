## Idea

An _[[embedding]] of [[topological spaces]]_ is a [[continuous function]] which is a [[homeomorphism]] onto its [[image]].

## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn #EmbeddingOfTopologicalSpaces}
###### Definition
**(embedding of topological spaces)**

Let $(X,\tau_X)$ and $(Y,\tau_Y)$ be [[topological spaces]]. A [[continuous function]] $f \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Y$ is called an _embedding_ if  
in its [[image factorization]] 

$$
  f 
    \;\colon\;
  X
    \overset{\phantom{A}\simeq\phantom{A}}{\longrightarrow}
  f(X)
    \overset{\phantom{AAA}}{\hookrightarrow}
  Y
$$

with the image $f(X) \hookrightarrow Y$ equipped with the [[subspace topology]], then $X \to f(X)$ is a [[homeomorphism]].

## Properties

+-- {: .num_prop #OpenClosedContinuousInjectionsAreEmbeddings}
###### Proposition
**([[closed injections are embeddings|open/closed continuous injections are embeddings]])**

A [[continuous function]] $f \colon (X, \tau_X) \to (Y,\tau_Y)$
which is

1. an [[injective function]]

1. an [[open map]] or a [[closed map]]

is an embedding (def. \ref{EmbeddingOfTopologicalSpaces}).

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

If $f$ is injective, then the map onto its [[image]] $X \to f(X) \subset Y$ is a [[bijection]]. Moreover, it is still continuous with respect to the subspace topology on $f(X)$. Now a bijective continuous function is a homeomorphism precisely if it is an [[open map]] or a [[closed map]] (by [this prop.](homeomorphism#HomeoContinuousOpenBijection)). But the image projection of $f$ has this property, respectively, if $f$ does (by [this prop.](open+map#OpenClosedImageProjection)).

###### Proposition 

Embeddings of topological spaces are precisely the [[regular monomorphisms]] in the [[category]] [[Top]] of all [[topological spaces]].
