## Statement

[[Michael Atiyah]] and [[Isadore Singer]] associated two differently defined numbers to an [[elliptic operator]] on a manifold: the **[[topological index]]**  and the **[[analytical index]]**. The index theorem asserts that the two are equal.

### From the point of view of physics
 {#ReferencesPhysics}

The index theorem is supposed to have an interpretation in terms of the [[quantum field theory]] of the [[superparticle]] on the given space.
