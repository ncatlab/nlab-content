## Idea

Fedosov's method ([Fedosov 94](#Fedosov94)) is a prescription for constructing [[formal deformation quantizations]] of the [[algebra of functions|algebra of]] [[smooth functions]] on any [[symplectic manifold]] $(X,\omega)$.

In particular this establishes the existence of formal deformation quantizations of all [[symplectic manifolds]]. While [Kontsevich 97](deformation+quantization#Kontsevich97) more generally proves the existence of deformation quantization of all [[Poisson manifolds]] of finite dimension, Fedosov's method, in a variant applicable to [[almost Kähler structures]] ([Karabegov-Schlichenmaier 01](#KarabegovSchlichenmaier01)) generalizes to infinite-dimensional symplectic manifolds as they appear in [[local field theory]], where it yields the quantization to [[perturbative quantum field theory]] equivalent to the method of [[causal perturbation theory]] ([Collini 16](#Collini16)). (Kontsevich's deformation quantization is however not compatible with field theory ([Hawkins-Rejzner 16, section 5.3.2](#HawkinsRejzner16)).) For more on this see at _[[locally covariant perturbative quantum field theory]]_.

Fedosov's method proceeds by the following steps:

1. For each point $x \in X$ regard the [[tangent space]] $T_x X$ as a [[symplectic vector space]] $(T_x X, \omega_x)$ and consider its [[Moyal deformation quantization]] $\mathcal{W}_x \coloneqq A_{Moy}(T_x X, \omega_x)$. In the context of [[local field theory]] these Moyal algebras are the [[Wick algebras]] of the underlying [[free field theory]].

   The union of these yelds an [[associative algebra]]-[[fiber bundle]] $\mathcal{W} \to X$. From the fiber-wise product in $A_{Moy}(T_x X, \omega_x)$ the [[space of sections]] $\Gamma_X(\mathcal{W})$ inherits itself the structure of an [[associative algebra]].

1. Find a [[flat connection]] $\nabla_{Fed}$ on $\mathcal{W}$ which respects the associative algebra structure, and such that there is a [[linear isomorphism]]

   $$
     \Gamma_X(\mathcal{W}) \supset  ker(\nabla_{Fed}) \simeq C^\infty(X) [ [ \hbar ] ] 
   $$ 

   between the [[covariantly constant sections]] of the algebra bundle and the algebra of  smooth functions on $X$ with a [[formal power series|formal variable]] $\hbar$ adjoined.

   Such $\nabla_{Fed}$ exists, (non-uniquely), it is called a _Fedosov connection_. 

1. By this linear isomorphism the algebra structure on $\Gamma_X(\mathcal{W})$ induces an [[associative algebra]] structure on $C^\infty(X)[ [ \hbar ] ]$, and this turns out to be a [[formal deformation quantization]] of $(X,\omega)$.

   In the context of [[local field theory]], this deformation quantization is equivalent to the result of quantization via [[causal perturbation theory]] ([Collini 16](#Collini16)).
