## Idea

The _complex projective plane_ $\mathbb{C}P^2$ is the [[complex projective space]] of [[complex numbers|complex]] [[dimension]] 2, hence the [[projective plane]] over the [[complex numbers]].

## Properties

### Quotient by complex conjugation is 4-sphere

The [[quotient space]] of the [[complex projective plane]] by the [[action]] on homogeneous coordinates of [[complex conjugation]] is the [[4-sphere]].

$$
  \mathbb{C}P^2 / (-)^*
  \simeq
  S^4
