Suppose $P$ is a finite [[partially ordered set]], and consider [[order-preserving functions]] from $P$ into a [[natural number]] $n$ viewed as a linear order
$$\mathbf{n} = \{ 0 \lt 1 \lt \cdots \lt n-1 \}.$$
Any such function $P \to \mathbf{n}$ factors as a [[surjection]] from $P$ onto some $\mathbf{k} = \{ 0 \lt 1 \lt \cdots \lt k-1 \}$, followed by an [[injection]] from $\mathbf{k}$ to $\mathbf{n}$. Hence, the total number $\Omega(P;n)$ of order-preserving functions from $P$ to $\mathbf{n}$ can be calculated as 
$$\Omega(P;n) = \sum_{k=1}^{|P|} e_k \binom{n}{k}$$
where $e_k$ is the number of surjective order-preserving functions from $P$ to $\mathbf{k}$. For a given $P$, this defines a polynomial in $n$, called the **order polynomial** of $P$.

## Examples

The order polynomial of $\mathbf{3} = \{ 0 \lt 1 \lt 2 \}$ is
$$n + 2\cdot \binom{n}{2} + \binom{n}{3} = \frac{n^3 + 3n^2 + 2n}{6}$$
For example, evaluating the polynomial at $n=3$ confirms that there are 10 order-preserving functions from $\mathbf{3}$ to itself.

The order polynomial of the 3-element poset
$$P = \array{&&c&& \\ &\nearrow& &\nwarrow& \\ a &&&& b}$$
is $n + 3\cdot \binom{n}{2} + 3\cdot\binom{n}{3} = \frac{2n^3 + 3n^2 + n}{6}$.
Evaluating at $n=2$, we compute that there are 5 order-preserving functions from $P$ onto $\mathbf{2}$.
