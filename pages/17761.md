Let $P$ be a finite [[partially ordered set]]. For any [[natural number]] $n$, the number of [[order-preserving functions]] from $P$ to $\mathbf{n} = \{ 0 \lt 1 \lt \cdots \lt n-1 \}$ can be calculated as
$$\Omega(P;n) = \sum_{s=1}^{|P|} e_s \binom{n}{s}$$
where $e_s$ is the number of [[surjective]] order-preserving functions from $P$ to $\mathbf{s}$. This defines a polynomial in $n$, called the **order polynomial** of $P$.
