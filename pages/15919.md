## Idea

Global Hodge theory is the study of Hodge theoretical invariants in
[[global analytic geometry]]. The basic idea is to try to generalize/combine
the results of classical (complex analytic) [[Hodge theory]] and of
[[p-adic Hodge theory]] in a unique setting.

A first (non-archimedean) step in this direction was given by Bhatt in his
paper on p-adic Hodge theory, where he proposed a Hodge theory
for (say semi-stable) varieties over $\Z$, using [[derived de Rham cohomology]]
to define a convenient [[period ring]]. From the point of view of global analytic
geometry, this gives a Hodge theory for strict analytic spaces over $\Z$,
equipped with its trivial norm. One may adapt these ideas to extend
them to a Hodge theory for strict analytic spaces over $\Z$, equipped with
its archimedean norm. The advantage of including the archimedean norm
in global Hodge theory is that this seems to give a better setting for the
study of completed [[arithmetic L-functions]] and [[automorphic L-functions]],
whose [[functional equation]] may not be proved without using the archimedean
information given by a convenient Gamma-factor. This extension is very easy
to make if one works with rational coefficients, like in Beilinson's original
paper on p-adic Hodge theory (i.e., with the `de Rham` period ring).
It remains a challenging problem to combine the non-archimedean and archimedean
information on Hodge theory without forgetting to take care of torsion phenomena in
cohomology, that are very important. This may be doable if one follows the line
of ideas used in Arakelov geometry, but formulated in a global analytic way. A very natural setting for this seems to be global [[strict analytic geometry]] over $\Z$ equipped with its archimedean norm.
