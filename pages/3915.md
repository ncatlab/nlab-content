###### Definition

For $i : X \hookrightarrow Y$ an [[immersion]] (notably an [[embedding]]) of [[smooth manifold]]s, the **normal bundle** of $X$ in $Y$ relative to $i$ is the the [[vector bundle]] 

$$
  N_i X  \to X
$$

which is [[fiber]]wise the [[quotient]] (of [[abelian group]]s underlying the [[vector space]]s) of the fiber of the [[tangent bundle]] of $Y$ by the [[tangent bundle]] of $X$: for $x \in X$

$$
  N_i (X)_x =  T_{i(x)}Y/T_x(X)
  \,.
$$

The dual notion is that of [[conormal bundle]].

###### Remark

There is always an [[isomorphism]]

$$
  T X \oplus N_i X  \simeq T Y|_X
  \,,
$$

but it is not canonically given, hence in particular cannot it general be chosen [[natural transformation|naturally]]. Except if certain additional structure is given:

If $Y$ is equipped with a [[Riemannian metric]] $g$, then we may identify the normal bundle with the bundle of [[vector]]s that are _orthogonal_  to ("normal to") the vectors in $T X$:

$$
  N_i(X) \simeq (T X)^\perp :=
  \{
    (x,v) \in T Y|_{X} | \forall w \in T_x X :  g(v,w) = 0
  \}
  \,.
$$
