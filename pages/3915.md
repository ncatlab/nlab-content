## Definition

For $i : X \hookrightarrow Y$ an [[immersion]] (notably an [[embedding]]) of [[manifold]]s, the **normal bundle** of $X$ in $Y$ relative to $i$ is the the [[bundle]] 

$$
  N_i(X) \to X
$$

which is [[fiber]]wise the [[quotient]] of the fiber of the [[tangent bundle]] of $Y$ by the [[tangent bundle]] of $X$: for $x \in X$

$$
  N_i(X)_x =  T_{i(x)}Y/T_x(X)
  \,.
$$

The dual notion is that of [[conormal bundle]].
