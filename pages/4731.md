## Idea

The notion of _connection on a 2-bundle_ generalizes the notion of [[connection on a bundle]] from [[principal bundle]]s to [[principal 2-bundle]]s.

It comes with a notion of [[higher parallel transport|2-dimensional parallel transport]].

For an exposition of the concepts here see also at _[[infinity-Chern-Weil theory introduction]]_ the section _[Connections on principal 2-bundles](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/infinity-Chern-Weil%20theory%20introduction#ConnectionOn2Bundle)_ .

## Definition

For $G$ a [[Lie 2-group]], a _connection_ on a $G$-[[principal 2-bundle]] coming from a [[cocycle]] $g : X \to \mathbf{B}G$ is a lift of the cocycle to the  [[2-groupoid of Lie 2-algebra valued forms]] $\mathbf{B}G_{conn}$

$$
  \array{
     && \mathbf{B}G_{conn}
     \\
     & {}^{\mathllap{\nabla}}\nearrow & \downarrow
     \\
     X &\stackrel{g}{\to}& \mathbf{B}G
  }
$$

## Properties

### Differential &Ccaron;ech cocycle data

We spell out the data of a connection on a 2-bundle over a [[smooth manifold]] $X$ with respect to a given [[open cover]] $\{U_i \to X\}$, following ...

## Examples

* A [[differential string structure]] (untwisted) is a 2-connection with coefficients in the [[string 2-group]] / [[string Lie 2-algebra]].

* The [[worldvolume]] theory of the [[fivebrane]] is expected to support a [[self-dual higher gauge theory]] whose fields are 2-connections (see _[Self-dual 2-connections](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/NS5-brane#SelfDual2Connections)_ there).
