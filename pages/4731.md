## Idea

The notion of _connection on a 2-bundle_ generalizes the notion of [[connection on a bundle]] from [[principal bundle]]s to [[principal 2-bundle]]s / [[gerbe]]s.

It comes with a notion of [[higher parallel transport|2-dimensional parallel transport]].

For an exposition of the concepts here see also at _[[infinity-Chern-Weil theory introduction]]_ the section _[Connections on principal 2-bundles](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/infinity-Chern-Weil%20theory%20introduction#ConnectionOn2Bundle)_ .

## Definition

For $G$ a [[Lie 2-group]], a _connection_ on a $G$-[[principal 2-bundle]] coming from a [[cocycle]] $g : X \to \mathbf{B}G$ is a lift of the cocycle to the  [[2-groupoid of Lie 2-algebra valued forms]] $\mathbf{B}G_{conn}$

$$
  \array{
     && \mathbf{B}G_{conn}
     \\
     & {}^{\mathllap{\nabla}}\nearrow & \downarrow
     \\
     X &\stackrel{g}{\to}& \mathbf{B}G
  }
$$

## Properties

### On trivial 2-bundles

When the underlying [[principal 2-bundle]] over a [[smooth manifold]] $X$ is topologically trivial, then the connections on it are identified with [[Lie 2-algebra valued differential forms]] on $X$.

Recall from the discussion there what such form data looks like.

Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be some [[Lie 2-algebra]]. For instance for discussion of connections on $G$-[[gerbe]]s ($G$ a [[Lie group]]) this would be the [[automorphism 2-group|derivation Lie 2-algebra]] of the [[Lie algebra]] of $G$.

Let $\mathfrak{g}_0$ and $\mathfrak{g}_1$ be the two vector spaces involved and let

$$
  \{t^a\} \,, \;\;\; \{b^i\}
$$

be a dual basis, respectively. The structure of a Lie 2-algebra is conveniently determined by writing out the most general [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] 

$$
  CE(\mathfrak{g}) \in cdgAlg_\mathbb{R}
$$

with these generators.

We thus have

$$
  d_{CE(\mathfrak{g})} t^a = - \frac{1}{2}C^a{}_{b c} t^b \wedge t^c - r^a{}_i b^i
$$

$$
  d_{CE(\mathfrak{g})} b^i = -\alpha^i_{a j} t^a \wedge b^j  
    - 
    r_{a b c} t^a \wedge t^b \wedge t^c
  \,,
$$

for collections of structure constants $\{C^a{}_{b c}\}$ (the bracket on $\mathfrak{g}_0$) and $\{r^i_a\}$ (the differential $\mathfrak{g}_1 \to \mathgfrak{g}_0$) and $\{\alph^i{}_{a j}\}$ (the [[action]] of $\mathfrak{g}_0$ on $\mathfrak{g}_1$) and $\{r_{a b c}\}$ (the "Jacobiator" for the bracket on $\mathfrak{g}_0$).

These constants are subject to constraints (the weak [[Jacobi identity]] and its higher [[coherence law]]s) which are precisely equivalent to the condition

$$
  (d_{CE(\mathfrak{g})})^2 = 0
  \,.
$$

Over a test space $U$ a $\mathfrak{g}$-valued form datum is a morphism

$$
  \Omega^\bullet(U) \leftarrow W(\mathfrak{g}) 
   : 
  (A,B)
$$

from the [[Weil algebra]] $W(\mathfrak{g})$.

This is given by a 1-form

$$
  A \in \Omega^1(U, \mathfrak{g}_0)
$$

and a 2-form

$$
  B \in \Omega^2(U, \mathfrak{g}_1)
  \,.
$$

The [[curvature]] of this is $(\beta, H)$, where the 2-form component ("fake curvature") is

$$
  \beta^a = d_{dR} A^a + \frac{1}{2}C^a{}_{b c} A^b \wedge A^c
  + r^a{}i B^i
$$

and whose 3-form component is 

$$
  H^i
     = 
   d_{dR} B^i
   +
   \alpha^i{}_{a j} A^a \wedge B^j
   +
   t_{a b c} A^a \wedge A^b \wedge A^c
  \,.
$$


### Differential &Ccaron;ech cocycle data

We spell out the data of a connection on a 2-bundle over a [[smooth manifold]] $X$ with respect to a given [[open cover]] $\{U_i \to X\}$, following

## Examples

* A [[differential string structure]] (untwisted) is a 2-connection with coefficients in the [[string 2-group]] / [[string Lie 2-algebra]].

* The [[worldvolume]] theory of the [[fivebrane]] is expected to be a [[6d (2,0)-supersymmetric QFT]] containing a [[self-dual higher gauge theory]] whose fields are 2-connections (see _[Self-dual 2-connections](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/NS5-brane#SelfDual2Connections)_ there).

* A connection on a [[twisted vector bundle]] is naturally a 2-connection.
