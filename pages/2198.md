## Idea

In addition to the well-known [[topological spaces]], many other structures can be used to found topological reasoning on sets, including [[uniform spaces]] and _proximity spaces_.  Proximity spaces provide a level of structure in between topologies and uniformities; in fact a proximity is equivalent to an equivalence class of uniformities with the same [[totally bounded space|totally bounded]] reflection.

Proximity spaces are often called _nearness spaces_, but this term has other meanings in the literature.  One can clarify with the term _set--set nearness space_.


## Definition

A __proximity structure__ (or set--set __nearness structure__) on a [[set]] $X$, or a __proximity relation__ (or __nearness relation__) on the [[power set]] $P(X)$ of subsets of $X$, is a binary [[relation]] $\delta$ on $P(X)$ such that 

1. _symmetry_:  $A\;\delta\;B$ iff $B\;\delta\;A$;

2. _binary additivity_:  $A\;\delta\;B\cup C$ iff either $A\;\delta\;B$ or $A\;\delta\;C$;

3. _nullary additivity_:  it is never true that $A\;\delta\;\emptyset$;

4. $\{x\}\;\delta\;\{y\}$ if $x=y$

5. if for every $C,D\subset X$ such that $C\cup D=X$, either $A\;\delta\;C$ or $B\;\delta\;D$, then $A\;\delta\;B$.

Another axiom one may require is the converse of (4):

*  _separation_:  $x=y$ if $\{x\}\;\delta\;\{y\}$

In general, we say that $A$ and $B$ are __proximate__ (or __near__) if $A\;\delta\;B$, and __apart__ otherwise.  We also write $A \ll B$ if $(X \setminus A)\;\delta\;B$.

A __proximity space__ (or set--set __nearness space__) is a set $X$ equipped with a proximity structure $\delta$.  The proximity structure or proximity space is __separated__ if it satisfies the separation axiom (the converse of 4); note that many authors require this by default.

### Variations

There are many variations possible in the list of axioms; one important consequence of the above (sometimes listed separately, allowing additivity to be weakened) is this:

*  _isotony_:  if $A\subset C$ and $B\subset D$, then $C\;\delta\;D$ if $A\;\delta\;B$.

It is also possible to write the definition in terms of the apartness relation or the relation $\ll$.  In particular, a (set--set) __apartness space__ is a set $X$ equipped with a binary relation $\bowtie$ on $P(X)$ such that the [[negation]] of $\bowtie$ is a proximity relation.  This is the preferred formulation in [[constructive mathematics]] (although you\'ll want to rephrase the definition axiom by axiom to remove spurious [[double negations]]).

## The category $Prox$

If $X$ and $Y$ are proximity spaces, then a function $f:X\to Y$ is said to be **proximally continuous** if $A\;\delta\;B$ implies $f(A)\;\delta\;f(B)$.  In this way we obtain a [[category]] $Prox$, whose evident forgetful functor $Prox \to Set$ makes it into a [[topological concrete category]].


## Relation to other topological structures

### Topological spaces

Every proximity space is a [[topological space]]; let $x$ belong to the closure of $A\subset X$ iff $\{x\}\;\delta\;A$.  This topology is always [[completely regular space|completely regular]], and [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] (hence [[Tychonoff space|Tychonoff]]) iff the proximity space is separated; see [[separation axiom]].  Proximally continuous functions are continuous for the induced topologies, so we have a functor $Prox \to Top$ over $Set$.

Conversely, if $(X,\tau)$ is a completely regular topological space, then for any $A,B\subset X$ let $A\;\delta\;B$ iff $A\neq \emptyset\neq B$ and there is no continuous function $f:X\to I=[0,1]$ such that $f(x)=0$ on $A$ and $f(x)=1$ on $B$. This defines a proximity structure on $X$, which induces the topology $\tau$ on $X$, and which is separated iff $\tau$ is a Hausdorff (hence Tychonoff) topology.

In general, a completely regular topology may be induced by more than one proximity.  However, if it is moreover [[compact topological space|compact]], then it has a unique compatible proximity.


### Uniform spaces

If $U$ is a [[uniformity]] on $Y$ (making it into a [[uniform space]]), then for all $A,B\subset Y$ let $A\delta B$ iff $V\cap (A\times B)\neq \emptyset$ for every [[entourage]] (aka vicinity) $V\in U$. This also defines a proximity structure on $Y$.

Uniformly continuous functions are proximally continuous for the induced proximities, so we have a functor $Unif \to Prox$ over $Set$.  Moreover, the composite $Unif \to Prox \to Top$ is the usual "underlying topology" functor of a uniform space, i.e. the topology induced by the uniformity and the topology induced by the proximity structure are the same.

Conversely, if $X$ is a proximity space, consider the family of sets of the form
$$ \bigcup_{k=1}^n A_k \times A_k$$
where $(A_k)$ is a finite family of sets such that there exists a finite family of sets $(B_k)$ with $B_k \ll A_k$ and $X = \bigcup_{k=1}^n B_k$.  These sets form a base for a [[totally bounded uniformity]] on $X$, which induces the given proximity.

In fact, this is the *unique* totally bounded uniformity which induces the given proximity: every proximity-class of uniformities contains a unique totally bounded member.  Moreover, a proximally continuous function between uniform spaces with totally bounded [[codomain]] is automatically uniformly continuous.  Therefore, the forgetful functor $Unif \to Prox$ is a left adjoint, whose right adjoint also lives over $Set$, is [[fully faithful functor|fully faithful]], and has its [[essential image]] given by the totally bounded uniform spaces.

In general, proximally continuous functions need not be uniformly continuous, but in addition to total boundedness of the codomain, a different sufficient condition is that the domain be a [[metric space]].

### Syntopogenous spaces

A proximity space can be identified with a [[syntopogenous space]] which is both *simple* and *symmetric*; see [[syntopogenous space]].


### Compactifications

The (separated) proximities inducing a given (Hausdorff) completely regular topology can be identified with (Hausdorff) compactifications of that topology.  The compactification corresponding to a proximity on $X$ is called its *Smirnov compactification*.  The points of this compactification can be taken to be *clusters* in $X$, which are defined to be collections $\sigma$ of subsets of $X$ such that

1. If $A\in\sigma$ and $B\in\sigma$, then $A\;\delta\;B$.
1. If $A\;\delta\;C$ for all $C\in\sigma$, then $A\in\sigma$.
1. If $(A\cup B)\in\sigma$, then $A\in\sigma$ or $B\in\sigma$.
