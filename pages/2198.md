## Idea

In addition to the well-known [[topological spaces]], many other structures can be used to found topological reasoning on sets, including [[uniform spaces]] and _proximity spaces_.  Proximity spaces provide a level of structure in between topologies and uniformities; in fact a proximity is equivalent to an equivalence class of uniformities with the same [[totally bounded space|totally bounded]] [[reflection]].

Proximity spaces are often called _nearness spaces_, but this term has other meanings in the literature. (See for example [this article](http://ijmsa.yolasite.com/resources/43--newnew.pdf).) One can clarify with the term _set--set nearness space_.


## Notation and terminology

A __proximity space__ is a kind of [[structured set]]: it consists of a [[set]] $X$ (the set of __[[points]]__ of the space) and a __proximity structure__ on $X$.  This proximity structure is given by any of various [[binary relations]] between the [[subsets]] of $X$:

*  The __proximity relation__ or __nearness relation__ $\delta$; subsets $A$ and $B$ are __proximal__  or __near__ if $A \;\delta\; B$;
*  The __apartness relation__ $\bowtie$; $A$ and $B$ are __apart__ if $A \bowtie B$.
*  The __neighbourhood relation__ $\ll$; $A$ is a __neighbourhood__ of $B$ if $B \ll A$.

The conditions required of these relations are given below in the Definitions.


In [[classical mathematics]], these relations are all interdefinable:

*  $A \;\delta\; B \;\iff\; \neg(A \bowtie B) \;\iff\; \neg(A \ll B')$;
*  $A \bowtie B \;\iff\; \neg(A \;\delta\; B) \;\iff\; A \ll B'$;
*  $A \ll B \;\iff\; \neg(A \;\delta\; B') \;\iff\; A \bowtie B'$.

(Here, $\neg$ indicates [[negation]] of truth values, while $B'$ is the [[complement]] of $B$ in $X$.)

In [[constructive mathematics]], any one of these relations may be taken as primary and the others defined using it; thus we distinguish, constructively, between a __set--set nearness space__, a __set--set apartness space__, and a __set--set neighbourhood space__.


## Definitions

From the previous section, we have a [[set]] $X$ and we are discussing [[binary relations]] $\delta, \bowtie, \ll$ on $X$.  These are required to satisfy the following conditions; in each row, the conditions for the various relations are all equivalent (classically).  In these conditions, $x, y$ are points, while $A, B, C$ are subsets, and we require them for all points or subsets.

| Name | Condition for nearness | Condition for apartness | Condition for neighbourhoods |
| - | - | - | - |
| Symmetry | $A \;\delta\; B$ iff $B \;\delta\; A$ | $A \bowtie B$ iff $B \bowtie A$ | $A \ll B$ iff $B' \ll A'$ |
| Additivity (left, binary) | $A \cup B \;\delta\; C$ iff $A \;\delta\; C$ or $B \;\delta\; C$ | $A \cup B \bowtie C$ iff $A \bowtie C$ and $B \bowtie C$ | $A \cup B \ll C$ iff $A \ll C$ and $B \ll C$ |
| Additivity (right, binary) | $A \;\delta\; B \cup C$ iff $A \;\delta\; B$ or $A \;\delta\; C$ | $A \bowtie B \cup C$ iff $A \bowtie B$ and $A \bowtie C$ | $A \ll B \cap C$ iff $A \ll B$ and $A \ll C$ |
| Additivity (left, nullary) | It is false that $\emptyset \;\delta\; A$ | $\emptyset \bowtie A$ | $\emptyset \ll A$ |
| Additivity (right, nullary) | It is false that $A \;\delta\; \emptyset$ | $A \bowtie \emptyset$ | $A \ll X$ |
| Isotony | If $A \subseteq C$ and $B \subseteq D$, then $C \;\delta\; D$ if $A \;\delta\; B$ | If $A \subseteq C$ and $B \subseteq D$, then $A \bowtie B$ if $C \bowtie D$ | If $A \subseteq C$ and $B \subseteq D$, then $A \ll D$ if $C \ll B$ |
| Reflexivity | If $A$ meets $B$ (their [[intersection]] is [[inhabited subset|inhabited]]), then $A \;\delta\; B$ | If $A \bowtie B$, then $A$ and $B$ are [[disjoint set|disjoint]] | If $A \ll B$, then $A \subseteq B$ |
| Regularity | If for every $D, E \subseteq X$ such that $D \cup E = X$, either $A \;\delta\; D$ or $E \;\delta\; B$, then $A \;\delta\; B$ | If $A \bowtie B$, then for some $D, E \subseteq X$ such that $D \cup E = X$, both $A \bowtie D$ and $E \bowtie B$ | If $A \ll B$, then for some $D, E \subseteq X$ such that $D \subseteq E$, both $A \ll D$ and $E \ll B$ |
| Separation | $x = y$ if $\{x\} \;\delta\; \{y\}$ | $x = y$ unless $\{x\} \bowtie \{y\}$ | $x = y$ unless $\{x\} \ll \{y\}'$ |

Separation should *not* be required by default; a proximity, proximity space, set--set apartness space, etc is __separated__ if it satisfies this axiom.

In this list, Isotony is redundant; it is equivalent to one direction of (left and right) binary additivity, so some lists include only the other direction.  In the light of Isotony, it is sufficient to state Reflexivity only for [[singleton subset|singletons]] (where $B$ in the axiom for neighbourhoods is the complement of a singleton instead, which is inappropriate in constructive mathematics); this is not common, but it allows us to see Separation as a converse of Reflexivity for singletons.  Similarly, Isotony allows us to assume that $D$ and $E$ are complements in Regularity (or that $D = E$ in the axiom for neighbourhoods), which is usually done (although this is inappropriate in constructive mathematics, except for neighbourhoods).  Finally, left and right Additivity are equivalent in the light of Symmetry, so usually only one direction is given.

On the other hand, we have a __quasiproximity__ (etc) if Symmetry is allowed to fail; then both left and right Additivity must be stated.  (Symmetry for neighbourhood spaces is particularly tricky in constructive mathematics.)


## The category $Prox$

If $X$ and $Y$ are proximity spaces, then a function $f:X\to Y$ is said to be **proximally continuous** if $A \;\delta\; B$ implies $f_*(A) \;\delta\; f_*(B)$, equivalently if $A \bowtie B$ whenever $f_*(A) \bowtie f_*(B)$, equivalently if $A \ll B$ whenever $f_*(A) \ll f_!(B)$.  In this way we obtain a [[category]] $Prox$, whose evident forgetful functor $Prox \to Set$ makes it into a [[topological concrete category]].


## Relation to other topological structures

### Topological spaces

Every proximity space is a [[topological space]]; let $x$ belong to the closure of $A\subset X$ iff $\{x\}\;\delta\;A$.  This topology is always [[completely regular space|completely regular]], and [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] (hence [[Tychonoff space|Tychonoff]]) iff the proximity space is separated; see [[separation axiom]].  Proximally continuous functions are continuous for the induced topologies, so we have a functor $Prox \to Top$ over $Set$.

Conversely, if $(X,\tau)$ is a completely regular topological space, then for any $A,B\subset X$ let $A\;\delta\;B$ iff $A\neq \emptyset\neq B$ and there is no continuous function $f:X\to I=[0,1]$ such that $f(x)=0$ on $A$ and $f(x)=1$ on $B$. This defines a proximity structure on $X$, which induces the topology $\tau$ on $X$, and which is separated iff $\tau$ is a Hausdorff (hence Tychonoff) topology.

In general, a completely regular topology may be induced by more than one proximity.  However, if it is moreover [[compact topological space|compact]], then it has a unique compatible proximity.


### Uniform spaces

If $U$ is a [[uniformity]] on $Y$ (making it into a [[uniform space]]), then for all $A,B\subset Y$ let $A\delta B$ iff $V\cap (A\times B)\neq \emptyset$ for every [[entourage]] (aka vicinity) $V\in U$. This also defines a proximity structure on $Y$.

Uniformly continuous functions are proximally continuous for the induced proximities, so we have a functor $Unif \to Prox$ over $Set$.  Moreover, the composite $Unif \to Prox \to Top$ is the usual "underlying topology" functor of a uniform space, i.e. the topology induced by the uniformity and the topology induced by the proximity structure are the same.

Conversely, if $X$ is a proximity space, consider the family of sets of the form
$$ \bigcup_{k=1}^n (A_k \times A_k)$$
where $(A_k)$ is a finite family of sets such that there exists a finite family of sets $(B_k)$ with $B_k \ll A_k$ and $X = \bigcup_{k=1}^n B_k$.  These sets form a base for a [[totally bounded uniformity]] on $X$, which induces the given proximity.

In fact, this is the *unique* totally bounded uniformity which induces the given proximity: every proximity-class of uniformities contains a unique totally bounded member.  Moreover, a proximally continuous function between uniform spaces with totally bounded [[codomain]] is automatically uniformly continuous.  Therefore, the forgetful functor $Unif \to Prox$ is a left adjoint, whose right adjoint also lives over $Set$, is [[fully faithful functor|fully faithful]], and has its [[essential image]] given by the totally bounded uniform spaces.

In general, proximally continuous functions need not be uniformly continuous, but in addition to total boundedness of the codomain, a different sufficient condition is that the domain be a [[metric space]].


### Syntopogenous spaces

A proximity space can be identified with a [[syntopogenous space]] which is both *simple* and *symmetric*; see [[syntopogenous space]].


### Compactifications

The (separated) proximities inducing a given (Hausdorff) completely regular topology can be identified with (Hausdorff) compactifications of that topology.  The compactification corresponding to a proximity on $X$ is called its *Smirnov compactification*.  The points of this compactification can be taken to be *clusters* in $X$, which are defined to be collections $\sigma$ of subsets of $X$ such that

1. If $A\in\sigma$ and $B\in\sigma$, then $A\;\delta\;B$.
2. If $A\;\delta\;C$ for all $C\in\sigma$, then $A\in\sigma$.
3. If $(A\cup B)\in\sigma$, then $A\in\sigma$ or $B\in\sigma$.
