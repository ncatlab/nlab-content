## Idea

In addition to the well-known [[topological spaces]], many other structures can be used to found topological reasoning on sets, including [[uniform spaces]] and _proximity spaces_.  Proximity spaces provide a level of structure in between topologies and uniformities; in fact a proximity is equivalent to an equivalence class of uniformities with the same [[totally bounded space|totally bounded]] reflection.

Proximity spaces are often called _nearness spaces_, but this term has other meanings in the literature.  One can clarify with the term _set--set nearness space_.


## Definition

A __proximity structure__ (or set--set __nearness structure__) on a [[set]] $X$, or a __proximity relation__ (or __nearness relation__) on the [[power set]] $P(X)$ of subsets of $X$, is a binary [[relation]] $\delta$ on $P(X)$ such that 

1. _symmetry_:  $A\;\delta\;B$ iff $B\;\delta\;A$;

2. _binary additivity_:  $A\;\delta\;B\cup C$ iff either $A\;\delta\;B$ or $A\;\delta\;C$;

3. _nullary additivity_:  it is never true that $A\;\delta\;\emptyset$;

4. $\{x\}\;\delta\;\{y\}$ if $x=y$

5. if for every $C,D\subset X$ such that $C\cup D=X$, either $A\;\delta\;C$ or $B\;\delta\;D$, then $A\;\delta\;B$.

Often one requires the converse of (4):

*  _separation_:  $x=y$ if $\{x\}\;\delta\;\{y\}$

We say that $A$ and $B$ are __proximate__ (or __near__) if $A\;\delta\;B$, and __apart__ otherwise.  We also write $A \ll B$ if $(X \setminus A)\;\delta\;B$.

A __proximity space__ (or set--set __nearness space__) is a set $X$ equipped with a proximity structure $\delta$.  The proximity structure or proximity space is __separated__ if it satisfies the separation axiom (the converse of 4); note that many authors require this by default.

There are many variations possible in the list of axioms; one important consequence of the above (sometimes listed separately, allowing additivity to be weakened) is this:

*  _isotony_:  if $A\subset C$ and $B\subset D$, then $C\;\delta\;D$ if $A\;\delta\;B$.

It is also possible to write the definition in terms of the apartness relation or the relation $\ll$.  In particular, a (set--set) __apartness space__ is a set $X$ equipped with a binary relation $\bowtie$ on $P(X)$ such that the [[negation]] of $\bowtie$ is a proximity relation.  This is the preferred formulation in [[constructive mathematics]] (although you\'ll want to rephrase the definition axiom by axiom to remove spurious [[double negations]]).


## Relation to other topological structures

### Proximities and topologies

Every proximity space is a [[topological space]]; let $x$ belong to the closure of $A\subset X$ iff $\{x\}\;\delta\;A$.  This topology is always completely regular, and Hausdorff (hence Tychonoff) iff the proximity space is separated; see [[separation axiom]].

Conversely, if $(X,\tau)$ is a completely regular topological space, then for any $A,B\subset X$ let $A\;\delta\;B$ iff $A\neq \emptyset\neq B$ and there is no continuous function $f:X\to I=[0,1]$ such that $f(x)=0$ on $A$ and $f(x)=1$ on $B$. This defines a proximity structure on $X$, which induces the topology $\tau$ on $X$, and which is separated iff $\tau$ is a Hausdroff (hence Tychonoff) topology.

### Proximities and uniformities

If $U$ is a uniformity on $Y$ (making it into a [[uniform space]]), then for all $A,B\subset Y$ let $A\delta B$ iff $V\cap (A\times B)\neq \emptyset$ for every [[entourage]] (aka vicinity) $V\in U$. This also defines a proximity structure on $Y$. The topology induced by the uniformity and the topology induced by the proximity structure are the same.

Conversely, if $X$ is a proximity space, consider the family of sets of the form
$$ \bigcup_{k=1}^n A_k \times A_k$$
where $(A_k)$ is a finite family of sets such that there exists a finite family of sets $(B_k)$ with $B_k \ll A_k$ and $X = \bigcup_{k=1}^n B_k$.  These sets form a base for a [[totally bounded uniformity]] on $X$, which induces the given proximity.  In fact, this is the *unique* totally bounded uniformity which induces the given proximity: every proximity-class of uniformities contains a unique totally bounded member, and so proximities can be identified with totally bounded uniformities.

### Proximities and compactifications

The (separated) proximities inducing a given (Hausdorff) completely regular topology can be identified with (Hausdorff) compactifications of that topology.  The compactification corresponding to a proximity on $X$ is called its *Smirnov compactification*.  The points of this compactification can be taken to be *clusters* in $X$, which are defined to be collections $\sigma$ of subsets of $X$ such that

1. If $A\in\sigma$ and $B\in\sigma$, then $A\;\delta\;B$.
1. If $A\;\delta\;C$ for all $C\in\sigma$, then $A\in\sigma$.
1. If $(A\cup B)\in\sigma$, then $A\in\sigma$ or $B\in\sigma$.


## Proximal continuity

If $X$ and $Y$ are proximity spaces, then a function $f:X\to Y$ is said to be **proximally continuous** if $A\;\delta\;B$ implies $f(A)\;\delta\;f(B)$.  A proximally continuous function is clearly continuous for the induced topologies, but the converse is generally not true.

Similarly, a uniformly continuous function between uniform spaces is proximally continuous for the induced proximities, but the converse is generally not true.  It is true, however, if the codomain is totally bounded or if the domain is a [[metric space]].
