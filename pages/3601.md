_Quantum information_ refers to data that can be physically stored in a quantum system. _Quantum information theory_ is the study of how such information can be encoded, measured, and manipulated. A notable sub-field is _quantum computation_, a term often used synonymously with quantum information theory, which studies protocols and algorithms that use quantum systems to perform computations.

_Categorical quantum information_ refers to a program in which the cogent aspects of Hilbert space-based quantum information theory are abstracted to the level of symmetric monoidal categories.

## Quantum information and quantum computation

In pure state quantum mechanics, physical states are encoded as vectors in a Hilbert space. Often Dirac "bra-ket" notation is used to represent such vectors, where $|\psi\rangle$ represents a state and $\langle \psi |$ represents its linear adjoint. State evolutions are expressed as unitary maps. Self-adjoint operators represent physical quantities such such as position and momentum and are called observables. Measurements are expressed as sets of projectors onto the eigenvectors of an observable.

In mixed state quantum mechanics, physical states are represented as density operators $\rho$, state evolution as maps of the form $\rho \mapsto U^\dagger \rho U$ for unitary maps $U$, and measurements are positive operator-valued measures (POVM's). There is a natural embedding of pure state quantum mechanics into the mixed state picture. (TODO: show this)
