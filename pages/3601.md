_Quantum information_ refers to data that can be physically stored in a quantum system. _Quantum information theory_ is the study of how such information can be encoded, measured, and manipulated. A notable sub-field is _quantum computation_, a term often used synonymously with quantum information theory, which studies protocols and algorithms that use quantum systems to perform computations.

_Categorical quantum information_ refers to a program in which the cogent aspects of Hilbert space-based quantum information theory are abstracted to the level of symmetric monoidal categories.
