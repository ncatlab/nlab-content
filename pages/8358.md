## Idea 

A realizability topos is a [[topos]] which embodies the [[realizability interpretation]] of [[intuitionistic mathematics|intuitionistic]] [[number theory]] (due to Kleene) as part of its [[internal logic]]. Realizability toposes form an important class of toposes that are not [[Grothendieck toposes]], and don't even have a [[geometric morphism]] to [[Set]].

The input datum for forming a realizability topos is a [[partial combinatory algebra]], or PCA. When the PCA is Kleene's first algebra, the resulting topos is called the [[effective topos]]. 


## Constructions 

There are a number of approaches toward constructing realizability toposes. One is through [[tripos]] theory, and another is through assemblies.

###### Definition 
Let $A$ be a PCA. An ($A$-)**partitioned assembly** $X$ consists of a set ${|X|}$ and a function $[-]_X \colon {|X|} \to A$. A **morphism** $X \to Y$ between partitioned assemblies is a function $f \colon {|X|} \to {|Y|}$ for which there exists $a \in A$ such that $a[x]_X$ is defined for all $x \in X$ and $a[x]_X = [f(x)]_Y$. The category of partitioned assemblies is denoted $Pass_A$.

###### Proposition 
$Pass_A$ is [[extensive category|lextensive]].

###### Theorem  
The [[exact completion|ex/lex completion]] of $Pass_A$ is a [[topos]], called the **realizability topos** of $A$.

###### Remark 
A general result about the ex/lex completion $C_{ex/lex}$ of a left exact category $C$ is that it has enough regular [[projective object|projectives]], meaning objects $P$ such that $\hom(P, -) \colon C_{ex/lex} \to Set$ preserves regular epis. In fact, the regular projective objects coincide with the objects of $C$ (as a subcategory of $C_{ex/lex}$). Of course, when $C_{ex/lex}$ is a topos, where every epi is regular, this means $C_{ex/lex}$ has enough projectives, or satisfies (external) [[COSHEP]]. It also satisfies internal [[COSHEP]], since binary products of projectives, i.e., products of objects of $C$, are again objects of $C$ (see [this result](/nlab/show/internally+projective+object#enough)).
