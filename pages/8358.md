## Idea 

A realizability topos is a [[topos]] which embodies the [[realizability interpretation]] of [[intuitionistic mathematics|intuitionistic]] [[number theory]] (due to Kleene) as part of its [[internal logic]]. Realizability toposes form an important class of toposes that are not [[Grothendieck toposes]], and don't even have a [[geometric morphism]] to [[Set]].

The input datum for forming a realizability topos is a [[partial combinatory algebra]], or PCA. 

* When the PCA is [[Kleene's first algebra]] $\mathcal{K}_1$, the resulting topos is called the [[effective topos]] $RT(\mathcal{K}_1)$. 

* When the PCA is [[Kleene's second algebra]] $\mathcal{K}_2$ then $RT(\mathcal{K}_2)$ is the [[function realizability topos]].


## Constructions 

There are a number of approaches toward constructing realizability toposes. One is through [[tripos]] theory, and another is through assemblies.

###### Definition 
Let $A$ be a [[partial combinatory algebra|PCA]]. An ($A$-)**partitioned assembly** $X$ consists of a set ${|X|}$ and a function $[-]_X \colon {|X|} \to A$. A **morphism** $X \to Y$ between partitioned assemblies is a function $f \colon {|X|} \to {|Y|}$ for which there exists $a \in A$ such that $a[x]_X$ is defined for all $x \in X$ and $a[x]_X = [f(x)]_Y$. The category of partitioned assemblies is denoted $Pass_A$.

###### Proposition 
$Pass_A$ is [[extensive category|lextensive]].

+-- {: .num_defn} 
###### Theorem  
The [[exact completion|ex/lex completion]] of $Pass_A$ is a [[topos]], called the **realizability topos** of $A$.

+-- {: .num_remark #pax}
###### Remark 
A general result about the ex/lex completion $C_{ex/lex}$ of a left exact category $C$ is that it has enough regular [[projective object|projectives]], meaning objects $P$ such that $\hom(P, -) \colon C_{ex/lex} \to Set$ preserves regular epis. In fact, the regular projective objects coincide with the objects of $C$ (as a subcategory of $C_{ex/lex}$). Of course, when $C_{ex/lex}$ is a topos, where every epi is regular, this means $C_{ex/lex}$ has enough projectives, or satisfies (external) [[COSHEP]]. It also satisfies internal [[COSHEP]], since binary products of projectives, i.e., products of objects of $C$, are again objects of $C$ (see [this result](/nlab/show/internally+projective+object#enough)).

## Properties

### Axiomatic characterization
 {#Characterization}

The following is a statement characterizing realizability toposes which is analogous to the [[Giraud axioms]] characterizing [[Grothendieck toposes]].

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

A [[locally small category]] $\mathcal{E}$ is ([[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to) a realizability topos precisely if

1. $\mathcal{E}$ is [[exact category|exact]] and [[locally cartesian closed category|locally cartesian closed]];

1. $\mathcal{E}$ has [[enough projectives]] and the [[full subcategory]] $Proj(\mathcal{E}) \hookrightarrow \mathcal{E}$ has all [[finite limits]];

1. the [[global section]] [[functor]] $\Gamma \coloneqq \mathcal{E}(\ast,-) \colon \mathcal{E}\longrightarrow $ [[Set]] 

   1. has a [[right adjoint]]  $\nabla \colon Set \hookrightarrow \mathcal{E}$ (which is necessarily a [[reflective subcategory|reflective inclusion]] making $\nabla \Gamma$ a finite-limit preserving [[idempotent monad]]/[[closure operator]]);

   1. $\nabla$ factors through $Proj(\mathcal{E})$;

1. there exists an object $D \in \mathcal{E}$ such that

   1. $D$ is $\nabla\Gamma$-[[separated presheaf|separated]] (in that its $(\Gamma \dashv \nabla)$-[[unit of a monad|unit]] is a [[monomorphism]]);

   1. all $\nabla \Gamma$-[closed](closure+operator#InducedClosureOnSlices) [[regular epimorphisms]] have the [[left lifting property]] against $D\to \ast$;

   1. for every [[projective object]] $P$ there is a $\nabla \Gamma$-[closed morphism](closure+operator#InducedClosureOnSlices) $P \to D$.
