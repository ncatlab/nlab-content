## Idea

The **Riemann hypothesis** or **Riemann conjecture** is the famous unproved statement that all nontrivial zeros of the [[Riemann zeta function]] are on the vertical line $Re(z)=1/2$ in the [[complex plane]]. 

Analogues of the Riemann hypothesis can be considered for many analogues of [[zeta functions]] and [[L-functions]], here one speaks of **generalized Riemann hypotheses**.  

An important special case over [[finite fields]] is called the **Riemann--Weil conjecture** and was proved by [[Deligne]] building on earlier ideas of [[Andre Weil|Weil]] and  [[Grothendieck]]. Grothendieck however expected a more natural proof using the (hypothetical) theory of [[motives]].

The suggestion that the Riemann hypothesis might have a proof that is an analogue of Weil's proof for [[arithmetic curves]] over [[finite fields]] $\mathbb{F}_q$ but generalized to the [[field with one element]] is due to
