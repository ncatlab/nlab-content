
The **Riemann hypothesis** or **Riemann conjecture** is the famous unproved statement that all nontrivial zeros of the [[Riemann zeta function]] are on the vertical line $Re(z)=1/2$ in the complex plane. Analogues of the Riemann hypothesis can be considered for many analogues of zeta functions/L-functions. An important case over the finite fields is called the **Riemann--Weil conjecture** and was proved by Deligne building on earlier ideas of [[Andre Weil|Weil]] and  [[Grothendieck]]. Grothendieck however expected a more natural proof using the (hypothetical) theory of [[motives]].
