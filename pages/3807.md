[[!redirects Riemann conjecture]]

**Riemann hypothesis** or **Riemann conjecture** is the famous unproved statement that all zeros of the [[Riemann zeta function]] are on the vertical line $Re(z)=1/2$ in the complex plane. Analogues of the Riemann hypothesis can be considered for many analogues of zeta functions/L-functions. An important case over the finite fields is called the **Riemann-Weil conjecture** and was proved by Deligne building on earlier ideas of [[Weil]] and  [[Grothendieck]]. Grothendieck however expected a more natural proof using the (hypothetical) theory of [[motives]].

[arXiv:0908.2909](http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/0908.2909) Abstract intersection theory and operators in Hilbert space
from arXiv Front: math.NT by Grzegorz Banaszak, Yoichi Uetake
For an operator of a certain class in Hilbert space, we introduce axioms of
an abstract intersection theory, which we prove to be equivalent to the Riemann
Hypothesis concerning the spectrum of that operator. In particular if the
nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta-function arise from an operator of this
class, the original Riemann Hypothesis is equivalent to the existence of an
abstract intersection theory.

We prove that more than 41% of the zeros of the zeta function are on the
critical line.

[arXiv:1206.2040](http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/1206.2040) A local field approach to the Riemann Hypothesis
from arXiv Front: math.NT by David Goss
Since the seminal work of Wan, Poonen, and Sheats in the 1990's, we have been
searching for the correct general statement of the Riemann Hypothesis ("RH")
which appears implicit in their results. Recently, upon viewing the extension
$\C/\R$ in light of results derived for the Carlitz module, we were led to view
the RH as a statement about ramification which we explore in this short work.
We shall see that, combined with some ideas flowing from the proofs of Wan,
Poonen, and Sheats, this ramification idea has a good deal of explanatory power
in finite characteristic. Indeed, unramified extensions of nonarchimedean local
fields are cyclotomic in nature and this fits perfectly with the best possible
extension of the result of Wan and Sheats. The notion that the zeroes "lie on a
line" seems to be the beginning of the story in finite characteristic, and we
show how this fits with having the zeroes be unramified.
