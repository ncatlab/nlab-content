## Idea

>$\mu\alpha\theta\eta\sigma\iota\varsigma$ - Learning (Gr.)

This page will discuss approaches to **teaching of mathematics** (as it is usual in the subject, with emphasis on the pre-university level, where the care in didactical aspects is the most relevant) and
the outstanding sources of the relevant materials about teaching.

#### Scope

Pedagogically well written introductory books in mathematics, rather than about pedagogical matter, are also of our concern, but they will preferably be posted under 
[[elementary mathematics]], [[introductions to mathematics]], [[elementary geometry]] and related pages.


## Overview

Most traditionally, teaching methods were improvized adaptations of communication of subject matter from the knowledgeable teacher to a learner.

Modern educational theory is greatly influenced by the works on child psychology. In particular, it has been investigated which cognitive aspects can be achieved at certain age, or within certain educational or other cognitive experiences. 

It is now commonly accepted that the advanced and long term knowledge is better achieved if the learner is also a discoverer. This means in mathematics that the emphasis on procedural knowledge should be replaced by wider experience in which a student discovers her own ways to approach the problems which make up the subject. The teacher and the learning environment hence have to anticipate and foster also specific _processes_ 
in learning the subject rather then only the goals and supposed content matter. Many authors however acknowledge the importance of balance with more traditional coaching and somewhat standardized procedural techniques (micromanagement being counterproductive). While in most educational taxonomies application of knowledge comes only at very hi stages in taxonomy, applying and experiencing concepts in practice, applications and in interaction with technology is considered necessary even at initial steps, and lower degrees of learning the subject. This should be therefore taken into account when creating the goals of mathematics curricula.
