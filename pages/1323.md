# Definition #

A [[category]] $C$  with finite [[product]]s and [[coproduct]]s is called **distributive** if for any $X,Y,Z\in C$ the canonical morphism
$$ X\times Y + X\times Z \to X\times (Y+Z)$$
is an isomorphism.  This axiom on binary coproducts easily implies the analogous $n$-ary result for $n\gt 2$, and in fact it also implies the analogous 0-ary statement that the projection
$$ X\times 0 \to 0$$
is an isomorphism for any $X$.

Any [[extensive category]] is distributive, but the converse is not true.
