## Definition 

A [[category]] $C$  with finite [[products]] and [[coproducts]] is called (finitary) **distributive** if for any $X,Y,Z\in C$ the canonical [[distributivity]] morphism
$$ X\times Y + X\times Z \to X\times (Y+Z)$$
is an isomorphism.  The canonical morphism is the unique morphism such that $X\times Y \to X\times (Y+Z)$ is $X\times i$, where $i\colon Y\to Y +Z$ is the coproduct injection, and dually for $X\times Z \to X\times (Y+Z)$.

**Warning:** a [[linearly distributive category]] is _not_ distributive in this sense.

This axiom on binary coproducts easily implies the analogous $n$-ary result for $n\gt 2$.  In fact it also implies the analogous 0-ary statement that the projection
$$ X\times 0 \to 0$$
is an isomorphism for any $X$.  Moreover, for a category with finite products and coproducts to be distributive, it actually suffices for there to be *any* [[natural transformation|natural]] family of isomorphisms $X\times Y + X\times Z \cong X\times (Y+Z)$, not necessarily the canonical ones; see the paper of Lack referenced below.

A category $C$ with finite products and all small coproducts is **infinitary distributive** if the statement applies to all small coproducts.  One can also consider $\kappa$-distributivity for a [[cardinal number]] $\kappa$, meaning the statement applies to coproducts of cardinality $\lt\kappa$.

Any [[extensive category]] is distributive, but the converse is not true.
