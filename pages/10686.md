There are several theorems by [[Serre]] which deserve to be called "finiteness theorems".

## In stable homotopy theory

On the [[homotopy groups of spheres]]

+-- {: .num_theorem }
###### Theorem
**(Serre finiteness theorem)**

The [[stable homotopy groups of spheres]] $\pi_{n+k}(S^k)$ are [[finite groups]] except

1. for $n = 0$ in which case $\pi_k(S^k) = \mathbb{Z}$;

1. $k = 2m$ and $n = 2m -1$ in which case

   $$
     \pi_{4m - 1}(S^{2m}) \simeq \mathbb{Z} \oplus F_m
   $$

   for $F_m$ a [[finite group]].

###### Remark

The non-torsion element in $\pi_{4k-1}(S^{2k})$ may be seen explicitly in the [[minimal Sullivan model]] for the [[rational n-sphere|rational 2k-sphere]], see there for more.
