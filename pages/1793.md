## Idea 

Model structures on chain complexes are [[model category]] structures on [[categories of chain complexes]] whose weak equivalences are [[quasi-isomorphism]]s. 

Via these model structures, all of the standard techniques in [[homological algebra]], such as injective and projective resolutions, are special cases of constructions in [[homotopy theory]], such as cofibrant and fibrant [[resolution]]s.

The existence of these model structures depends subtly on whether the chain complexes in question are bounded or not. 

### In non-negative degree

Chain complexes in non-negative degree in an [[abelian category]] $A$ are special in that they may be identified via the [[Dold–Kan correspondence]] as [[simplicial object]]s in $A$.

$$
  Ch_+(A) \simeq A^{\Delta^{op}}
  \,.
$$

At least if $A$ is the category of [[abelian groups]], so that $A^{\Delta^{op}}$ is the category of abelian [[simplicial group]]s it inherits naturally a model category structure from the [[model structure on simplicial sets]], which [[presentable (∞,1)-category|presents]] the [[(∞,1)-category]] of [[∞-groupoid]]s.

The model structure on chain complexes transports this presentation  of the special $\infty$-groupoids given by abelian simplicial groups along the Dold-Kan correspondence to chain complexes.

Analogous statements apply to the category of unbounded chain complexes and the canonical [[stable (infinity,1)-category]] [[Spec]] of [[spectrum|spectra]].

## History and references

Of course the above description of categories of chain complexes as ([[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presentations]] of) special cases of (stable) $(\infty,1)$-categories is exactly opposite to the historical development of these ideas. 

While the homotopical treatment of weak equivalences of chain complexes ([[quasi-isomorphism]]s) in [[homological algebra]] is at the beginning of all studies of higher categories and a "folk theorem" ever since

* [[Andre Joyal]], Letter to Alexander Grothendieck. April 11, 1984

it seems that the injective model structure on chain complexes has been made fully explicit in print only in proposition 3.13 of

* Tibor Beke, _Sheafifiable homotopy model categories_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0102087), [pdf](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/math/pdf/0102/0102087v1.pdf))

(at least according to the remark below that).

The projective model structure is discussed after that in

Variant model structures on chain complexes are discussed in

Work specifically on model structures on unbounded complexes includes the following.

Spaltenstein wrote a famous paper 

* N. Spaltenstein, _Resoutions of unbounded complexes_, Compositio Mathematica, 65 no. 2 (1988), p. 121-154 ([numdam](http://www.numdam.org/item?id=CM_1988__65_2_121_0))

on how to do homological algebra with unbounded complexes (in both sides) where he introduced notions like K-projective and K-injective complexes. Later, 

* V. Hinich, _Homological algebra of homotopy algebras_, Comm. Algebra, vol. 25 (1997), no. 10, 3291-3323
([pdf at author's page](http://math.haifa.ac.il/hinich/WEB/mypapers/haha.pdf)) 

shown that there is a model category structure on the category of unbounded chain complexes, reproduced Spaltenstein's results from that perspective and extended them widely. See also
