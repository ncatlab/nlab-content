## Idea 

Model structures on chain complexes are [[model category]] structures on [[categories of chain complexes]] whose weak equivalences are [[quasi-isomorphism]]s. 

Via these model structures, all of the standard techniques in [[homological algebra]], such as injective and projective resolutions, are special cases of constructions in [[homotopy theory]], such as cofibrant and fibrant [[resolution]]s.

The existence of these model structures depends subtly on whether the chain complexes in question are bounded or not. 

### In non-negative degree

Chain complexes in non-negative degree in an [[abelian category]] $A$ are special in that they may be identified via the [[Dold–Kan correspondence]] as [[simplicial object]]s in $A$.

$$
  Ch_+(A) \simeq A^{\Delta^{op}}
  \,.
$$

At least if $A$ is the category of [[abelian groups]], so that $A^{\Delta^{op}}$ is the category of abelian [[simplicial group]]s it inherits naturally a model category structure from the [[model structure on simplicial sets]], which [[presentable (∞,1)-category|presents]] the [[(∞,1)-category]] of [[∞-groupoid]]s.

The model structure on chain complexes transports this presentation  of the special $\infty$-groupoids given by abelian simplicial groups along the Dold-Kan correspondence to chain complexes.

Analogous statements apply to the category of unbounded chain complexes and the canonical [[stable (infinity,1)-category]] [[Spec]] of [[spectrum|spectra]].

### Model structures on cochain complexes in non-negative degree {#CochainNonNeg}

Let $C$ be an [[abelian category]]. 

Recall that by the dual [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] the category $C^\Delta$ of [[cosimplicial object]]s in $C$ is equivalent to the catagory $Ch^\bullet_+(C)$ of [[cochain complex]]es in non-negative degree. This means that we can transfer results discussed at [[model structure on cosimplicial objects]] to cochain complexes (see [Bousfield2003, section 4.4](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/math/pdf/0312/0312531v1.pdf) for more).

#### General results

Let $G \in Obj(C)$ be a [[class]] of objects, such that $C$ has enough $G$-[[injective object]]s. 

Then there is a model category structure $Ch^\bullet_+(C)_G$ whose

* weak equivalences are maps $f : X \to Y$ such that for each $A \in G$ the induced map $C(Y,A) \to C(X,A)$ is a [[quasi-isomorphism]] of chain complexes of abelian groups;

* $f$ is a cofibration if it is $G$-monic in positive degree;

* $f$ is a fibration if it is degreewise a [[split epimorphism]] with $G$-injective kernel.
 
If for example we take $G$ to be the class of all objects of $C$, then this induces a model structure $Ch^\bullet_+(C)_{tot}$ whose

* weak equivalences are cochain [[homotopy equivalence]]s;

* fibrations are morphisms that are degreewise [[split epimorphism]]s;

* cofibration are morphisms that are in positive degree [[split monomorphism]]s.

As an example of that, if $C = $ [[Vect]] is a category of [[vector space]]s over some field, we have that every epi/mono splits and that every [[quasi-isomorphism]] is a homotopy equivalence. 

This is the model structure which induces the [[transferred model structure|transferred]] [[model structure on dg-algebra]]s over a field. 

#### The projective model structure {#CochainNonNegProj}


+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Theorem

The category $Ch^\bullet_+(Ab)$ of non-negatively graded cochain complexes of [[abelian group]]s becomes a model category with

* fibrations the degreewise surjections;

* weak equivalences the [[quasi-isomorphism]]s.

This is a [[simplicial model category]]-structure
with respect to the canonical structure of an [[sSet]]-[[enriched category]]
induced from the dual [[Dold-Kan correspondence|Dold-Kan equivalence]]
$Ch^\bullet_+(Ab) \simeq Ab^\Delta$ by the fact that $Ab^\Delta$  is a [[category of cosimplicial objects]] (see there) in a category with all limits and colimits.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We spell out a proof of the model structure below in a sequence of 
lemmas. The proof that this is a simplicial model category is
at [[model structure on cosimplicial abelian groups]].

=--

We record a detailed proof of the model structure on $Ch^\bullet_+(Ab)$ with fibrations the degreewise surjections, following the appendix of ([Stel](#Stel)).

+-- {: .un_def}
###### Definition

As usual, for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ write $\mathbb{Z}[n]$ for the complex concentrated on the additive group of [[integer]]s in degree $n$, and for $n \geq 1$  write $\mathbb{Z}[n-1,n]$ for the cochain complex $(0 \to \cdots 0 \to \mathbb{Z} \stackrel{Id}{\to} \mathbb{Z} \to 0 \cdots)$ with the two copies of $\mathbb{Z}$ in degree $n-1$ and $n$.

For $n = 0$ let $\mathbb{Z}[-1,0] = 0$, for convenience.

=--





+-- {: .un_lemma}
###### Lemma
{#ProjStructGenCofibs}

For all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the canonical maps $0 \to \mathbb{Z}[n]$ and $\mathbb{Z}[n] \to \mathbb{Z}[n-1,n]$ are cofibrations, in that they  have the [[left lifting property]] against acyclic fibrations.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


Let $p : A \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} B$ be degreewise surjective and an isomorphism on cohomology. 

First consider $\mathbb{Z}[0]\to \mathbb{Z}[-1,0] = 0$. We need to construct lifts

$$
  \array{
     \mathbb{Z}[0] &\stackrel{f}{\to}& A
     \\
     \downarrow &{}^{\mathllap{\sigma}}\nearrow& \downarrow^{p}
     \\
     0 &\stackrel{}{\to}& B
  }
  \,.
$$

Since $p(f_0(1)) = 0$ we have by using that $p$ is a quasi-iso that $f_0(1) = 0 \; mod\; im d_A$. But in degree 0 this means that $f_0(1) = 0$. And so the unique possible lift in the above diagram does exist.


Consider now $\mathbb{Z}[n] \to \mathbb{Z}[n-1,n]$ for $n \geq 1$. We need to construct a lift in all diagrams of the form

$$
  \array{
     \mathbb{Z}[n] &\stackrel{f}{\to}& A
     \\
     \downarrow &{}^{\mathllap{\sigma}}\nearrow& \downarrow^{p}
     \\
     \mathbb{Z}[n-1,n] &\stackrel{g}{\to}& B
  }
  \,.
$$

Such a lift is equivalently an element $\sigma \in A_{n-1}$ such that 

* $d_A \sigma = f_n(1)$

* $p_{n-1}(\sigma) = g_{n-1}(1)$.

Since $p$ is a quasi-isomorphism, and since it takes the closed element $f_n(1) \in A_n$ to the exact element $p_n(f_n(1)) = d_B g_{n-1}(1)$ it follows that $f_n(1)$ itself must be exact in that there is $z \in A_{n-1}$ with $d_A z = f_n(1)$. Pick such.

So then $d_B ( p(z) - g_{n-1}(1) ) = 0$ and again using that $p$ is a quasi-isomorphism this means that there must be a closed $a \in A_{n-1}$ such that $p(a) = p(z)- g_{n-1}(1) + d_B b$ for some $b \in B_{n-2}$. Choose such $a$ and $b$.

Since $p$ is degreewise onto, there is $a'$ with $p(a') = b$. Choosing this the above becomes $p(a) = p(z) - g_{n-1}(1) + p(d_A a')$. 

Set then 

$$
  \sigma := z - a + d_A a'
  \,.
$$

It follows with the above that this satisfies the two conditions on $\sigma$: 

$$
  \begin{aligned}
     d_A \sigma &= d_A z - d_A a + d_A d_A a' 
     \\
     & =
     d_A z 
     \\
      & = f_n(1)
  \end{aligned}
$$

$$
  \begin{aligned}
     p( \sigma ) &=  p(z) - p(a) + p(d_A a')
     \\
     & = g_{(n-1)}(1)
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

Finally consider $0 \to \mathbb{Z}[n]$ for all $n$. We need to produce lifts in

$$
  \array{
     0 &\stackrel{}{\to}& A
     \\
     \downarrow &{}^{\mathllap{\sigma}}\nearrow& \downarrow^{p}
     \\
     \mathbb{Z}[n] &\stackrel{g}{\to}& B
  }
  \,.
$$

Such a lift is a choice of element $\sigma \in A_n$ such that

* $d_A \sigma = 0$;

* $p(\sigma) = g_n(1)$;

Since $g_n(1)$ is closed and $p$ a surjective quasi-isomorphism, we may find a closed $a \in A_n$ and an $a' \in A_{n-1}$ such that 
$p (a) = g_{n}(1) + d_B(p(a'))$. Set then

$$
  \sigma := a - d_A a'
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .un_lemma}
###### Lemma

For all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the morphism $0 \to \mathbb{Z}[n-1,n]$
are acyclic cofibrations, in that they have the [[left lifting property]] again all degreewise surjections.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

For $n = 0$ this is trivial. For $n \geq 1$ a diagram

$$
  \array{
    0 &\to& A
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    \mathbb{Z}[n-1,n] &\stackrel{g}{\to}& B
  }
$$

is equivalently just any element $g_{n-1}(1) \in B$ and 
a lift $\sigma$ accordingly just any element $\sigma \in A$ 
with $p(\sigma) = g_{n-1}(1)$. Such exists because $p$ is degreewise
surjctive by assumption.

=--


+-- {: .un_lemma}
###### Lemma
{#ProjStructCharAcyclicFibrations}

A morphism $f : A \to B$ is an acyclic fibration precisely if it has 
the [[right lifting property]] against $0 \to \mathbb{Z}[n]$ and
$\mathbb{Z}[n] \to \mathbb{Z}[n-1,n]$ for all $n$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the above lemmas, it remains to show only one direction:
if $f$ has the RLP, then it is an acyclic fibration.

So assume $f$ has the RLP. Then from the existence of the lifts

$$
  \array{  
     0 &\to& A
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     \mathbb{Z}[n] &\stackrel{g}{\to}& B
  }
$$

one deduces that $f$ is degreewise surjective on closed elements.
In particular this means it is surjective in cohomology.

With that, it follows from the existence of all the lifts

$$
  \array{  
     \mathbb{Z}[n] &\stackrel{f}{\to}& A
     \\
     \downarrow &{}^{\mathllap{\sigma}}\nearrow& \downarrow
     \\
     \mathbb{Z}[n-1,n] &\stackrel{g}{\to}& B
  }
$$

for $f$ a lift of the closed element $g_n(1)$ that $f$ is 
degreewise surjective on all elements. 

Moreover, these lifts say that if $f_n(1)$ is any closed element such that
under $p$ it becomes exact ($d_B g_{n-1}(1) = p(f_n(1))$), then it
must already be exact itself ($d_A \sigma_{n-1}(1) = f_n(1)$). Hence
$f$ is also injective on cohomology and hence by the above is 
an isomorphism on cohomology.

=--

+-- {: .un_lemma}
###### Lemma
{#ProjStrucFactAxiomI}

Every morphism $f : A \to B$ can be factored as 
a morphism with left leifting property against all
fibrations followed by a fibration.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Apply the [[small object argument]]-reasoning to the
maps in $ J = \{0 \to \mathbb{Z}[n-1,n]\}$.

Since for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ a morphism $\mathbb{Z}[n,n+1]\to B$
corresponds to an element $b \in B_n$. From the commuting 
diagram

$$
  \array{
    0 &\to& A
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    \coprod_{{n \in \mathbb{n}} \atop {b \in B_n}}
    \mathbb{Z}[n,n+1] &\stackrel{}{\to}&
    B
  }
$$

one obtains a factorization through its [[pushout]]

$$
  \array{
     && A 
     \\
       &{}^{\mathllap{j}}\swarrow& \downarrow
     \\
     A \coprod \coprod_{{n \in \mathbb{n}} \atop {b \in B_n}}
     \mathbb{Z}[n,n+1]
     && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
     \\
     &\searrow_{p}& \downarrow
     \\
     && B 
  }
  \,.
$$

Since $j$ is the pushout of an acyclic cofibration, it is
itself an acyclic cofibration. Moreover, since the cohomology
of $\coprod_{{n \in \mathbb{n}} \atop {b \in B_n}} \mathbb{Z}[n,n+1]$
clearly vanishes, it is a quasi-isomorphism.

The map $p$ is manifestly degreewise
onto and hence a fibration. 

=--

+-- {: .un_lemma}
###### Lemma

Every morphism $f : A \to B$ may be factored as a
cofibration followed by an acyclic fibration.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By a  [lemma above](#ProjStructCharAcyclicFibrations) acyclic fibrations
are precisely the maps with the right lifting property against
morphisms in $I = \{0 \to \mathbb{Z}[n], \mathbb{Z}[n]\to \mathbb{Z}[n-1,n]\}$, which by the [first lemma above](#ProjStructGenCofibs)
are cofibrations.

The claim then follows again from the [[small object argument]]
apllied to $I$.

=--

+-- {: .un_lemma}
###### Lemma

A morphism $f : A \to B$ that is both a cofibration
(:= LLP against acyclic fibrations ) and a weak equivalence
has the left lifting property against all fibrations.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By a standard argument, this follows from the 
factorization lemma proven [above](#ProjStrucFactAxiomI),
which says that we may find a factorization

$$
  \array{ 
    A &\stackrel{j}{\to}& \hat B
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{f}}\searrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    && B
  }
$$

with $j$ having LLP against all fibrations and being
a weak equivalence, and $p$ a fibration. Since $f$ is
assumed to be a weak equivalence, it follows that
$p$ is an acyclic fibration. By definition of cofibrations
as $LLP(Fib \cap W)$ this implies that we have the lift in

$$
  \array{
    A &\stackrel{j}{\to}& \hat B
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow 
    &{}^{\mathllap{\sigma}}\nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    B &\stackrel{Id}{\to}& B
  }
  \,.
$$

Equivalently redrawing this as

$$
  \array{
    A &\stackrel{Id}{\to}& A &\stackrel{Id}{\to}& A
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow && {}^{\mathllap{p}}
    \downarrow && {}^{\mathllap{i}}\downarrow 
    \\
    B &\stackrel{\sigma}{\to}&
    \hat B \stackrel{p}{\to}
  }
$$

makes manifest that this exhibts $f$ as a retract of $j$
and as such inherits its left lefting properties.

=--

This series of lemmas establishes the claimed model structure
on $Ch^\bullet_+(Ab)$.

### Model structure on unbounded chain complexes {#OnUnbounded}

#### General results

Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an [[abelian category]] with all [[limit]]s and 
[[colimit]]s.

Write $Ch(\mathcal{A})$ for [[category of chain complexes|category of unbounded chain complexes]] in $\mathcal{A}$. 

Following [Christensen-Hovey](#ChristensenHovey) there is a family of model category structures on $Ch(\mathcal{A})$, all refining the [[category with weak equivalences]] given by [[quasi-isomorphism]]s, but where the fibrations are degreewise surjections in a generalized sense, a sense that is parameterized by a choice of _projective class_ . 

{#ProjectiveClass}

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

A **projective class** on $\mathcal{A}$ is a collection $\mathcal{P} \subset ob \mathcal{A}$ of [[object]]s and a collection $\mathcal{E} \subset mor \mathcal{A}$ of [[morphism]]s, such that

* $\mathcal{E}$ is precisely the collection of $\mathcal{P}$-epic maps;

* $\mathcal{P}$ is precisely the collection of all objects $P$ such that each map in $\mathcal{E}$ is $P$-epic.

=--

{#TrivialProjectiveClass}

+-- {: .un_example}
###### Example

Taking $\mathcal{P} := ob \mathcal{A}$ to be the class of _all_ objects yields a projective class -- called the *trivial projective class** . The corresponding morphisms are the class $\mathcal{E}$ of all [[split epimorphism]]s in $\mathcal{A}$.

=--

{#PullbackProjectiveClass}

+-- {: .un_example}
###### Example

Let $R$ be a [[ring]] and $\mathcal{A} = $ $R$-[[Mod]] be the category of $R$-[[module]]s. Choosing $\mathcal{P}$ to be the class of all summands of [[direct sums]] of [[finitely presented]] modules yields a projective class.

=--

+-- {: .un_example}
###### Example

Given a pair of [[adjoint functor]]s 

$$
  (F \dahsv U) : \mathcal{A} \stackrel{\overset{F}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{U}{\to}} \mathcal{B}
$$ 

between [[abelian categories]] and given $(\mathcal{P}, \mathcal{E})$ a projective class in $\mathcal{B}$ then its **pullback projective class** $(U * \mathcal{P}, U^* \mathcal{E})$ along $U$ on $\mathcal{A}$ is defined by

* $U^* \mathcal{P} := \{retracts\;of\; F P | P \in \mathcal{P}\}$

 
=--

+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Definition/Theorem

Given a projective class $\mathcal{P}$ in $\mathcal{A}$, call a morphism $f \in Ch(\mathcal{A)$ 

* a fibration if $\mathcal{A}(P,f)$ is a surjection in [[Ab]] for all $P \in \mathcal{P}$;

* a weak equivalence if it is a [[quasi-isomorphism]]. 

Then this constitutes a [[model category]] structure precisely if cofibrant [[resolution]]s exist, which is the case in particular if

1. $\mathcal{P}$ is the [pullback projective class](#PullbackProjectiveClass) of a [trivial projective class](#TrivialProjectiveClass) along a functor $U$ that preserves countable [[direct sum]]s;

1. blah-blah


When the structure exists, it is a [[proper model category]].


=--

This is theorem 2.2 in [Christensen-Hovey](#ChristensenHovey).

#### Examples 

Let $R$ be an associative ring and $\mathcal{A} = R$[[Mod]].

* The **categorical projective class** on $\mathcal{A}$ is the [projective class](#ProjectiveClass) with $\mathcal{P}$ the class of [[sirect sum]]mands of free modules. The $\mathcal{P}$-model structure on $Ch(\mathcal{A})$ has as fibrations the degreewise surjections.

* The **pure projective class** on $\mathcal{A}$ has as $\mathcal{P}$ summands of sums of finitely presented modules. Fibrations in the corresponding model structure are the maps that are degreewise those epimorphisms that appear in $\mathcal{P}$-exact sequences.
