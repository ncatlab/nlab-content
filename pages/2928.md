## Idea

An **involution** is an [[endomorphism]] whose square is the [[identity morphism]].  Such an endomorphism must be an [[automorphism]]; indeed, it is its own [[inverse morphism|inverse]].

Where this makes sense, an __anti-involution__ is an [[antihomomorphism]] instead of a [[homomorphism]] (so an antiendomorphism and necessarily an antiautomorphism).

## Monad of involutions

An involution on a set $X$ is the same thing as an [[action]] of $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ on $X$.

More generally, let $(C,\otimes,1)$ be a [[monoidal category]] with [[distributive monoidal category|distributive]] finite [[coproducts]]. The object $2 = 1 + 1$ is equipped with an involution
$$
not : 2 \to 2
$$
defined as the [[copairing]] $not = [inr,inl]$ of the right and left injections.
Moreover, 2 can be given the structure of a [[monoid]] in $C$, with unit and multiplication
$$false : 1 \to 2 \qquad xor : 2 \otimes 2 \to 2$$
defined by $false = inl$ and $xor = [id,not]$ (here we make use of the isomorphism $2 \otimes 2 \cong 2 + 2$ to define $xor$ by copairing). The mapping
$$
X \mapsto 2 \otimes X \cong X + X
$$
thus extends to a [[monad]] on $C$, sending any object $X$ to the free object equipped with an involution over $X$. Explicitly, the unit $\eta_X : X \to 2\otimes X$ and the multiplication $\mu_X : 2\otimes 2\otimes X \to 2\otimes X$ of the monad are defined by tensoring the unit and the multiplication of the monoid with the identity on $X$, while the involution on $2 \otimes X$ is likewise defined by tensoring the involution on 2 with the identity on $X$. We then have that involutions in $C$ are precisely the [[module over a monad|algebras]] of the monad $(2\otimes-,false\otimes-,xor\otimes-)$.

## Properties

Two involutions $f, g : X \to X$ [[commutative diagram|commute]] if and only if their composition $f g$ is also an involution, as displayed by the following algebra:

$$f g = f (f g f g ) g = (f f) g f (g g) = g f$$

$$(f g)(f g) = f (g f) g = f (f g) g = (f f)(g g)= 1$$

In [[combinatorics]], an important class of involutions are the [[fixed point]] free ones: an arbitrary involution on a [[finite set]] of cardinality $n$ may be specified by the choice of $k$ elements which are fixed together with a fixed point free involution on the remaining $(n-k)$.  The number of fixed point free involutions on a set of $2n$ labelled elements is counted by the double factorial $(2n-1)!! = (2n-1)\cdot (2n-3)\cdot\dots\cdot 3\cdot 1 = \frac{(2n)!}{2^n n!}$, while arbitrary involutions on a set of $n$ labelled elements are counted by OEIS sequence [A000085](https://oeis.org/A000085), which also counts the number of [[Young tableaux]] with $n$ cells.
