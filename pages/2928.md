## Idea

An **involution** is an [[endomorphism]] whose square is the [[identity morphism]].  Such an endomorphism must be an [[automorphism]]; indeed, it is its own [[inverse morphism|inverse]].

Where this makes sense, an __anti-involution__ is an [[antihomomorphism]] instead of a [[homomorphism]] (so an antiendomorphism and necessarily an antiautomorphism).
