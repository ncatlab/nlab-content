## Idea

An **involution** is an [[endomorphism]] whose square is the [[identity morphism]].  Such an endomorphism must be an [[automorphism]]; indeed, it is its own [[inverse morphism|inverse]].

Where this makes sense, an __anti-involution__ is an [[antihomomorphism]] instead of a [[homomorphism]] (so an antiendomorphism and necessarily an antiautomorphism).

## Properties

Two involutions $f, g : X \to X$ [[commutative diagram|commute]] if and only if their composition $f g$ is also an involution, as displayed by the following algebra:

$$f g = f (f g f g ) g = (f f) g f (g g) = g f$$

$$(f g)(f g) = f (g f) g = f (f g) g = (f f)(g g)= 1$$

In [[combinatorics]], an important class of involutions are the [[fixed point]] free ones: an arbitrary involution on a [[finite set]] of cardinality $n$ may be specified by the choice of $k$ elements which are fixed together with a fixed point free involution on the remaining $(n-k)$.  The number of fixed point free involutions on a set of even cardinality $2n$ is counted by the double factorial $(2n-1)!! = (2n-1)\cdot (2n-3)\cdot\dots\cdot 3\cdot 1 = \frac{(2n)!}{2^n n!}$, while arbitrary involutions on a set of cardinality $n$ are counted by OEIS sequence [A000085](https://oeis.org/A000085), which also counts the number of [[Young tableau]] with $n$ cells.
