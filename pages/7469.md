A **circuitoid** is a generalization of a category, where each morphisms has an arbitrary (possibly infinite) number of arguments. Two arguments are not required to have the same number of arguments.

See [this manuscript](http://www.mathematics21.org/binaries/circuitoids.pdf) where I first define circuitoids. Feel free to copy notions from that my manuscript into nLab site.

I havenâ€™t (yet) defined some notion of associativity for circuitoids. This may be a topic of our future research.
