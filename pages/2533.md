## Definition

“Discrete mathematics” is a term that in the current mathematical practice (as witnessed, for example, by the journal [Discrete Mathematics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/discrete-mathematics)) refers to [[combinatorics]] and closely related fields (or subfields): finite geometry and [[incidence geometry]], [[coding theory]] and [[Boolean functions]], combinatorics of [[posets]], [[matroid]] theory, convex geometry and [[polytopes]], packings, tilings, etc.

In some undergraduate curricula this term is used to refer to a course
complementary to the calculus/precalculus courses, primarily devoted to elementary [[combinatorics]], along with prerequisites for combinatorics such as naïve [[set theory]] and elementary [[number theory]].
