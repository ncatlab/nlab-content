Good part of [[mathematics]] refers to continuous or even smooth spaces of various kinds. **Discrete mathematics** is about discrete structures: [[logics]], [[set theory]] and [[combinatorics]] are typical fields in this domain. Algebra can comprise both discrete and continuous algebraic structures. 

In $n$lab many items are dedicated to the [[foundations|foundational]] issues in **set theory** (starting with standard basic notions like [[set]], [[proper class]], [[empty set]], [[singleton]], [[subset]], [[relation]], [[reflexive relation]], [[transitive relation]], [[symmetric relation]], [[function]], [[partial function]], [[injection]], [[surjection]], [[bijection]], [[union]], [[disjoint union]], [[complement]], [[intersection]], [[symmetric difference]], [[power set]], [[pointed set]] along with more foundational items like [[axiom of choice]], [[axiom of extensionality]], [[axiom of foundation]], [[axiom of infinity]], [[Zorn's lemma]], [[well-ordering theorem]], [[decidable subset]], [[material set theory]], [[inhabited set]], [[COSHEP]], [[Markov's principle]], [[Grothendieck universe]], [[choice operator]], [[pure set]], [[hereditarily finite set]]). **Logics** is also having some entries; among them are [[truth value]] or [[0-poset]], [[predicate]], [[excluded middle]], [[implication]]. We pay attention to the alternative approaches to logics and set theory, like the internal language of a [[topos]], cf.  [[Mitchell-Benabou language]]; Lawvere's [[ETCS]]; Nelson's [[internal set]] theory etc.  

Some other basic **discrete structures** which have their own entry in $n$lab are [[preorder]], [[order]], [[partial order]], [[total order]], [[well-order]], [[equivalence relation]], [[quotient set]], [[poset]], [[proset]], [[cyclic order]], [[semilattice]], [[lattice]], [[distributive lattice]], [[meet]], [[join]], [[supremum]], [[infimum]], [[suplattice]], [[multiset]], [[graph]], [[quiver]], [[tree]], [[filter]], [[span]], [[multispan]], [[natural number]], [[sequence]]...

Of course, plain old [[category]] is a discrete structure per se.
