## Idea
 {#Idea}

Taken at its verbatim face value, the term *discrete mathematics* refers to [[mathematics]] concerned with [[mathematical structures]] which are *discrete* in the sense of *[[discrete topological spaces]]*, hence which do not involve [[topology]] and in particular do *not* involve [[analysis]] ("[[calculus]]"). 

With the hindsight of the [[nPOV]] one could usefully say that discrete mathematics, in this sense, is the topic of ([[categorical semantics|models]] of) bare [[homotopy type theory]], in contrast to its [[cohesion|cohesive]] refinement to [[cohesive homotopy type theory]].

However, in common parlance the term *discrete mathematics* is used much more restrictively:

On the one hand, it often appears as the title of those introductory courses in the undergraduate [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]] curricula which are devoted to teaching an overview of a variety of topics such as [[combinatorics]] and [[graph theory]] and associated [[algorithms]] and its prerequisites such as na√Øve [[set theory]], basic [[predicate logic]], an introduction to [[proofs]], and elementary [[number theory]] (e.g. [Molluzzo & Buckley 1986](#MolluzzoBuckley86)). 

On the other hand, in research mathematics the term *discrete mathematics* is mainly used (see the references [below](#ResearchLevelReferences)) as a synonym for *[[combinatorics]]* and closely related fields (or subfields): finite geometry and [[incidence geometry]], [[coding theory]] and [[Boolean functions]], combinatorics of [[posets]], [[matroid]] theory, convex geometry and [[polytopes]], packings, [[tilings]], etc.
