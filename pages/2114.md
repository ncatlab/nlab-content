Classically, an __algebraic variety__ is thought of as a geometric locus of zeros of a set of [[polynomial]] equations in finitely many variables. Historically, there were several formalisms of various schools including the Italian school of [[algebraic geometry]] in the early 20th century (Veronese, Castelnuovo, Severi, ...), the American school between the two wars ([[Oscar Zariski]]), [[Andre Weil]], the abstract varieties of [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] and finally the [[scheme]] language of the [[Grothendieck]] school. One should note that in the case of (esp. projective) varieties over complex numbers there is an additional possibility to work using complex-analytic tools and complex topology.

Given an [[algebraically closed field]] $k$, an __algebraic $k$-variety__ is an affine, quasiaffine, projective or quasiprojective $k$-variety. __Affine__ $k$-varieties are [[maximal spectrum|maximal spectra]] (= sets of [[maximal ideals]]) of finitely generated [[noetherian ring|noetherian]] (commutative unital) $k$-[[commutative algebra|algebras]] without [[nilpotent element|nilpotents]] with the [[Zariski topology]]; the algebra can be recovered as the coordinate ring of the variety; this correspondence is an equivalence of categories, if the morphisms are properly defined. Affine varietes can be embedded as closed subvarieties into an [[affine space]] (in the sense of algebraic geometry). As topological spaces affine varieties are [[noetherian space|noetherian]]. __Projective__ $k$-varieties are obtained in a similar way from [[graded algebra|graded]] $k$-algebras. __Quasiaffine__ $k$-varieties are Zariski-open subspaces of affine $k$-varieties; __quasiprojective__ $k$-varieties are Zariski-open subspaces of projective $k$-varieties. In fact, by noticing that the affine $k$-space is Zariski open in a projective space of the same dimension, we see that the quasiprojective case includes all others. Morphisms between varieties are so-called [[regular map]]s.  Note that every kind of algebraic variety above may be interpreted as a quasiprojective variety.

There is an [[equivalence of categories]] between the category of [[integral schemes]] of finite type over $Spec\,k$, where $k$ is an algebraically closed field, and the category of algebraic $k$-varieties. Of course, the corresponding [[scheme]] and variety have different sets of points; the points in common are the closed points of the scheme. The remaining points are the generic points of subvarieties. Generic points were often used, without proper foundations, in other language, already in the works of the Italian school. Some modern algebraic geometers mean, by varieties, objects of certain slightly bigger categories of relative $S$-schemes (where $S$ is not necessarily $Spec\,k$). 

An amusing discussion on the differences between schemes and varieties can be found at _Secret blogging seminar_: [algebraic geometry without prime ideals](http://sbseminar.wordpress.com/2009/08/06/algebraic-geometry-without-prime-ideals).
