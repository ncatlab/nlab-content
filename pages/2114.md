Given an [[algebraically closed field]] $k$, an __algebraic $k$-variety__ is an affine, quasiaffine, projective or quasiprojective $k$-variety. __Affine__ $k$-varieties are [[maximal spectrum|maximal spectra]] (= sets of [[maximal ideals]]) of finitely generated [[noetherian ring|noetherian]] (commutative unital) $k$-[[commutative algebra|algebras]] without [[nilpotent element|nilpotents]] with the [[Zariski topology]]; the algebra can be recovered as the coordinate ring of the variety; this correspondence is an equivalence of categories, if the morphisms are properly defined. Affine varietes can be embedded as closed subvarieties into an affine $n$-space (in the sense of algebraic geometry). As topological spaces affine varieties are [[noetherian space|noetherian]]. __Projective__ $k$-varieties are obtained in a similar way from [[graded algebra|graded]] $k$-algebras. __Quasiaffine__ $k$-varieties are Zariski-open subspaces of affine $k$-varieties; __quasiprojective__ $k$-varieties are Zariski-open subspaces of projective $k$-varieties. In fact, by noticing that the affine $k$-space is Zariski open in a projective space of the same dimension, we see that the quasiprojective case includes all others. Morphisms between varieties are so-called [[regular map]]s.

There is an [[equivalence of categories]] between the category of [[integral schemes]] of finite type over $Spec\,k$, where $k$ is an algebraically closed field, and the category of algebraic $k$-varieties. Of course, the corresponding [[scheme]] and variety have different sets of points; the points in common are the closed points of the scheme. The remaining points are the generic points of subvarieties. Generic points were often used, without proper foundations, in other language, already in the works of the Italian school of [[algebraic geometry]] in first half of 20th century. Some modern algebraic geometers mean, by varieties, objects of certain slightly bigger categories of relative $S$-schemes (where $S$ is not necessarily $Spec\,k$). 

An amusing discussion on the differences between schemes and varieties can be found at _Secret blogging seminar_: [algebraic geometry without prime ideals](http://sbseminar.wordpress.com/2009/08/06/algebraic-geometry-without-prime-ideals).
