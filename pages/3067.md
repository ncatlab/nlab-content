A **pseudomonoid** in a [[monoidal 2-category]] is a [[categorification]] of the notion of a [[monoid]] in a [[monoidal category]].

A pseudomonoid in the [[cartesian monoidal category|cartesian]] monoidal 2-category [[Cat]] is precisely a [[monoidal category]].  The general definition can be extracted from this special case in a straightforward way.

Just as a monoid in a monoidal category can be equivalently defined as a [[monad]] in the corresponding one-object [[2-category]], a pseudomonoid in a monoidal 2-category can equivalently be defined as a [[pseudomonad]] in the corresponding one-object [[3-category]].
