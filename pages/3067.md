##Idea##
A **pseudomonoid** in a [[monoidal 2-category]] is a [[categorification]] of the notion of a [[monoid object]] in a [[monoidal category]].

##Definition## 
A pseudomonoid in the [[cartesian monoidal category|cartesian]] monoidal 2-category [[Cat]] is precisely a [[monoidal category]].  The general definition can be extracted from this special case in a straightforward way. The precise definition can be found in Section 3 of the paper of Day and Street referenced below. 

Just as a monoid in a monoidal category $C$ can be equivalently defined as a [[monad]] in the corresponding one-object [[2-category]] $\mathbf{B}C$ (the [[delooping]] of $C$), so a pseudomonoid in a monoidal 2-category $C$ can equivalently be defined as a [[pseudomonad]] in the corresponding one-object [[3-category]] $\mathbf{B}C$.

## Variations

* A **map pseudomonoid** is a pseudomonoid whose multiplication and unit are [[bicategory of maps|maps]], i.e. [[left adjoints]].  This is a more appropriate notion for monoidal bicategories whose morphisms are [[profunctors]], since maps therein can be identified (modulo [[Cauchy completion]]) with [[functors]].

Other more special kinds of pseudomonoid are generalizations of special kinds of monoidal categories, including:

* braided pseudomonoids
* symmetric pseudomonoids
* balanced pseudomonoids
* closed pseudomonoids
* $\ast$-autonomous, a.k.a. [[Frobenius pseudomonoids]]
* compact closed (or autonomous) pseudomonoids

Eventually these should probably have their own pages.

## Properties

The 2-category of symmetric pseudomonoids in a monoidal 2-category has (weak) 2-coproducts given by the tensor product of underlying objects (analogously to how the category of [[commutative monoids]] in a monoidal category has coproducts given by the tensor product of the underlying objects).  This is proven in [Schaeppi, Appendix A](#Schaeppi).
