## Idea

An _associator_ in [[category theory]] and [[higher category theory]] is an [[isomorphism]] that relaxes the ordinary [[associativity]] _equality_ of a binary operation.

### In Bicategories

In a [[bicategory]] the [[composition]] of [[1-morphism]]s does not satisfy [[associativity]] as an equation, but there are natural _associator_ 2-morphisms 

$$
  h \circ (g \circ f) \stackrel{\simeq}{\Rightarrow} (h \circ g) \circ f
$$

that satisfy a [[coherence law]] among themselves.

If one thinks of the bicategory as obtained from a [[geometric definition of higher categories|geometrically defined 2-category]] $C$, then the composition opeeration of 1-morphisms is a _choise_ of  2-[[horn]]-fillers and the associator is a _choice_ of filler of the spheres $\partial \Delta[3] \to C$ formed by these. 


### In monoidal categories

By the [[periodic table of higher categories]] a [[monoidal category]] is a pointed [[bicategory]] with a single object, its [[object]]s are the 1-morphisms of the bicategory. Accordingly, here the  associator is a [[natural isomorphism]] 

$$ a_{x,y,z} : (x \otimes y) \otimes z \to x (\otimes y \otimes z) $$

relating the triple [[tensor product]]s of these objects.
