## Idea

A _cohomology operation_ is a family of [[morphism]] between [[cohomology groups]], which is [[natural transformation|natural]] with respect to the base space. 

Equivalently, if the [[cohomology theory]] has a [[classifying space]] (as it does for all usual notions of [[cohomology]], in particular for all [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology theories]]) then, by the [[Yoneda lemma]], cohomology operations are in natural bijection with [[homotopy]]-classes of morphisms between classifying spaces.

(This statement is made fully explicit for instance below def. 12.3.22 in ([Aguilar-Gitler-Prieto](#AguilarGitlerPrieto)).

$$
  \{
    H^k(-, E)
    \to
    H^l(-, F)
  \}
  \simeq
  Ho(E_k, F_l)
  \,.
$$

## Examples

* every [[universal characteristic class]] is a cohomology operation.

* [[Bockstein homomorphism]]

* [[cup product]]

* [[Massey product]]

* [[power operation]]

  * [[Steenrod squares]] are the stable cohomology endo-operations on [[ordinary cohomology]] (mod 2)

  * [[Adams operations]] are the endo-cohomology operations on [[K-theory]]

* [[logarithmic cohomology operation]]
