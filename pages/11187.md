## Idea

A Fell Bundle is a family of [[Banach space|Banach spaces]] that varies continuously over the morphism space of a [[topological groupoid]], where nontrivial morphisms in the groupoid induce a bilinear composition across the fibers. They are a generalization of both [[continuous field of C*-algebras|continuous fields]] of $C^*$-algebras over topological spaces and of $C^*$-algebraic bundles (bundles of $C^*$-algebras over topological groups).

###### Definition

A Fell Bundle is a continuous $*$-functor $p \colon \mathcal{C} \to G$ from a $C^*$-[[C-star-category|category]] $\mathcal{C}$ to a topological groupoid $G$.
