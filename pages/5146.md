##Idea
A _$\Pi$-algebra_ is an algebraic model for the homotopy groups $\pi_*X$ of a pointed space, $X$, together with the action of the [[primary homotopy operations]] on them, in the same sense that algebras over the Steenrod algebra are models for the cohomology of a space.


##The category $\Pi$ of homotopy operations
This has

* as objects - pointed CW-complexes with the homotopy type of a finite wedge of spheres of dimentions $\geq 1$;


* as morphisms - homotopy classes of (pointed) maps between them.
