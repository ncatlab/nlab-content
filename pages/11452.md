## Idea

In the context of [[real-oriented cohomology theory]], notably in _[[KR-theory]]_, by "real space" (real manifold) one means a [[space]] ([[manifold]]) equipped with an [[action]] of the [[group of order 2]] $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ (a "non-linear [[real structure]]").

In the context of [[string theory]] real spaces appear as [[orientifold]] [[target space|target]] [[spacetimes]]. The involution [[fixed points]] here are known as _[[O-planes]]_.

## Examples

### Real circles

There are three non-equivalent real structures on the [[circle]] $S^1$, usually denoted

* $S^{2,0}$ for the trivial involution;

* $S^{1,1}$ for the reflection involution (identifying the two semi-circles);

* $S^{0,2}$ for the antipodal involution (rotation by $\pi$).

Accordingly [[real-oriented cohomology theory]] is bigraded in a way modeled on this bigrading.

(This is standard notation, but maybe $S^{1,0}$, $S^{\tfrac{1}{2}, \tfrac{1}{2}}, S^{0,1}$ would be more suggestive. Indeed the quotients in the first and the last case are actually circles, while in the second case it is the semi-circle.)


## Properties

### Relation to real cobordism

There is a "real" analog of [[complex cobordism cohomology theory]] $MU$, the [[MR cohomology theory]] $M \mathbb{R}$.

While $\pi_\bullet(M \mathbb{R})$ is _not_ the [[cobordism ring]] of [[real manifolds]], still every [[real manifold]] does give a class in $M \mathbb{R}$ ([Kriz 01, p. 13](#Kriz01)). For details see here: [pdf](http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/fm/fm161/fm16115.pdf).
