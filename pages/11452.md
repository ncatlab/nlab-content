## Idea

In the context of [[real-oriented cohomology theory]], notably in _[[KR-theory]]_, by "real space" one means a [[space]] equipped with an [[action]] of the [[group of order 2]] $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$.

## Examples

### Real circles

There are three non-equivalent real structures on the [[circle]] $S^1$, usually denoted

* $S^{2,0}$ for the trivial involution;

* $S^{1,1}$ for the reflection involution (identifying the two semi-circles);

* $S^{0,2}$ for the antipodal involution.

Accordingly [[real-oriented cohomology theory]] is bigraded modeled on this.
