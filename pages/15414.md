[[!redirects QD topos]]
[[!redirects locally decidable object]]

##Idea
Loosely speaking a _locally decidable topos_ is a topos that is locally Boolean. Whereas in a [[Boolean topos]] every object is decidable, in a locally decidable topos every object is a quotient of a [[decidable object]]. This results in a reasonable approximation to the concept of 'being almost Boolean'.

In Lawvere's approach to cohesion locally decidable toposes are one of the principal classes of **petit toposes** (Lawvere 1991).
In the 1991 paper Lawvere also hypothesizes the discrete base topos $\mathcal{S}$ that he contrasts with the cohesive topos of spaces, to be locally decidable.[^fine]

[^fine]: Lawvere uses the term 'QD'-topos ( _quotient of decidable_) for 'locally
decidable topos' in this paper. He also uses 'SUD'-object (from _separable-unramified-decidable_ to indicate equivalent concepts in algebra-topology-logic) for what we call a locally decidable object. In later papers Lawvere uses also the terms 'locally separable'or 'adequately separable'. The idea to take a locally decidable base topos is probably suggested by [[Galois theory]] where 'locally decidable' corresponds roughly to 'product of separable field extensions' for an algebra over a field $k$. This also connects the notion '[[decidable object|decidable]]' via Grothendieck's Galois theory to the topological notion 'unramified'.

##Definition
An object $X$ in a topos $\mathcal{E}$ is called _locally decidable_ (or, a _quotient of a decidable object_) iff there is an epimorphism $Y\twoheadrightarrow X$ such that $Y$ is a [[decidable object]]. $\mathcal{E}$ is called _locally decidable_ iff every object $X$ is locally decidable.

##Examples

* The [[classifying topos]] $Set[\mathbf{D}]=[FinSet_{mono},Set]$ for the [[theory of decidable objects]] $\mathbf{D}$ is locally decidable. Here $FinSet_{mono}$ is the category of finite sets and monomorphisms, whose opposite category is the carrier of the site for the so called (Myhill-) _[[Schanuel topos]]_.

* Every [[localic topos]] is locally decidable.

* For every [[Grothendieck topos]] $\mathcal{E}$ the full subcategory $\mathcal{E}_{QD}$ of locally decidable objects is a locally decidable topos.

##Properties

* **Proposition**. A topos $\mathcal{E}$ is locally decidable iff there is a [[localic topos|localic]] geometric morphism to a Boolean topos, or iff $\mathcal{E}$ has a site $(\mathcal{C}, J)$ with all morphisms in $\mathcal{C}$ epic.

* Locally decidable toposes are 'co-étendues' in the sense that for a small $\mathcal{C}$ the functor category $[\mathcal{C},Set]$ is locally decidable precisely if $[\mathcal{C}^{op},Set]$ is an [[étendue]]. Also the all-epic-site property is dual to the all-monic-site property of étendues. Both concepts are subsumed under the notion of having a (sub canonical) site representation with no (non-trivial) [[idempotents]] (McLarty 2006, Lawvere 2007,2008).

* A locally decidable topos has a [[localic topos|localic geometric morphism]] to the [[Schanuel topos]] (cf. Johnstone 2002, p.794).
