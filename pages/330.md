# Global elements

## Idea

One striking difference between [[set theory]] and [[category theory]] is that, while [[objects]] of a [[category]] need not have any other structure, a [[set]] comes equipped with the notion of _element_, identifying other sets which belong to it.  Sometimes, a category turns out to possess a similar structure, designating certain [[morphisms]] as __global elements__ (or __global points__ in geometric contexts) of an object.


## Definition

If a category $C$ has a [[terminal object]] $1$, a __global element__ of another object $x$ is a morphism $1 \to x$.

So a global element is a [[generalized element]] at "stage of definition" $1$.

For example:

* In [[Set]], global elements are just elements: a function from a one-element set into $x$ picks out a single element of $x$.

* In [[Cat]], global elements are objects: the terminal category $1$ is the [[discrete category]] with one object, and a [[functor]] from $1$ into a category $C$ singles out an object of $C$.

* In a [[topos]], a global element of the [[subobject classifier]] is called a [[truth value]].

* Working in a [[over category|slice category]] $C/b$, a global element of the object $\pi: e \to b$ is a map into it from the terminal object $1_b: b \to b$; i.e., a [[right inverse]] for $\pi$.  In the context of [[bundles]], a global element of a bundle is called a *[[global section]]*.


## Variations

Many (but not all) of the examples above are [[cartesian closed categories]].  In a more general [[closed category]], a morphism from the unit object to $x$ can be called an _element_ of $x$. For example, an element of an [[abelian group]] $x$ is a morphism from the group $\mathbf{Z}$ of integers to $x$, and of course this is equivalent to the usual notion of element of $x$. But here the adjective 'global' is not used.

Somewhat relatedly, there is[^1] a usage defining the informal notion "name of a morphism" as follows: if $\mathcal{C}$ is any [[closed monoidal category]], then 

 (*name* of a morphism $A\overset{f}{\rightarrow}B$ in $\mathcal{C}$) 

$:=$ 

(global element $I\overset{\text{"f"}}{\rightarrow} [A,B]$ of the internal hom $[A,B]$ in $\mathcal{C}$), 

where $I$ denotes [[the]] monoidal unit of $\mathcal{C}$. When $C$ is cartesian closed or even [[semicartesian monoidal category|semicartesian monoidal]] closed, this name is a global element in the sense of this article (but may sometimes be called a global element regardless, even for the more general case).

In contrast to a global element, a morphism to $x$ from _any_ object $i$ whatsoever may be seen as a [[generalized element]] of $x$. For example, if $i$ is the [[unit interval]] (in topology, chain complexes, etc), then a map from $i$ to $x$ is a *path* (rather than a point) in $x$. Or in a slice category $C/b$, if $\rho: a \to b$ is an [[embedding]], then a morphism from $\rho$ to $\pi$ is a _local_ section of $\pi$.
