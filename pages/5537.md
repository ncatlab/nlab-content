## Definition

A **pro-set** is a [[pro-object]] in the [[category]] [[Set]].

This should not be confused with [[proset]], an abbreviation of "preordered set."

## Pro-sets versus locales

### The classifying locale of a pro-set

Since $Pro(Set)$ is the [[free completion]] of [[Set]] under [[cofiltered limits]], any functor out of $Set$ into a category with cofiltered limits extends uniquely to a cofiltered-limit-preserving functor from $Pro(Set)$.  In particular, we can consider the functor $Set \to Loc$ from $Set$ to the category of [[locales]] which regards a set as a [[discrete space|discrete]] locale.

If $(S_i)_i$ is a pro-set, which we may WLOG assume to be indexed on a [[directed poset]], then the corresponding locale $\lim S_i$ is presented by the following [[posite]].  Its underlying [[poset]] is the [[category of elements]] of the [[diagram]] $(S_i)_i$, i.e. its elements are pairs $(i,x)$ with $x\in S_i$, and we have $(i,x)\le (j,y)$ if $i\le j$ and $s_{i j}(x)=y$, where $s_{i j} \colon S_i \to S_j$ is the transition map.  The covers in the posite are generated by $(i,x) \lhd s_{i j}^{-1}(x)$ for any $i,j,x$.

Thus, the open sets in the locale $\lim S_i$ are the "ideals" for this coverage, i.e. sets $A$ of pairs $(i,x)$ which are down-closed and such that if $(j,y)\in A$ for some $j$ and all $y\in s_{i j}^{-1}(x)$, then $(i,x)\in A$.

### The pro-set $\pi_0$ of a locale

On the other hand, there is a naturally defined functor $\pi_0\colon Loc \to Pro(Set)$ which sends a locale to its pro-set of [[connected components]].  The vertices of the cofiltered diagram defining $\pi_0(X)$ are decompositions $X = \coprod_{i\in I} U_i$ of $X$ as a [[coproduct]] of [[open subsets]], and the corresponding set is the index set $I$.  We say $(U_i) \le (V_j)$ for decompositions set$(U_i)$ and $(V_j)$ if each $U_i$ is contained in some $V_j$; this induces a map $I\to J$.  (If the $U_i$ are allowed to be empty, then this map is not uniquely determined, so that we can have more than one morphism $(U_i)\to (V_j)$; thus $\pi_0$ is a cofiltered category rather than merely a directed set.  We can avoid this by requiring all the $U_i$ to be [[positive element|positive]].)

Note that if $X$ is [[locally connected space|locally connected]], then it has a "minimal" such decomposition, namely its decomposition into [[connected components]].  Thus, in this case $\pi_0(X)$ is a mere set.

This is the [[(0,1)-topos]] version of the [[fundamental group of a topos]] or the [[fundamental ∞-groupoid of an (∞,1)-topos]].

###### Theorem
The functor $\pi_0\colon Loc \to Pro(Set)$ is left adjoint to $\lim\colon Pro(Set)\to Loc$.

###### Proof
Since $\lim$ is given by regarding a pro-set as a diagram of discrete locales and taking its limit, it suffices to show that morphisms of pro-sets $\pi_0(X) \to S$, for a set $S$, are equivalent to morphisms of locales $X \to S_{disc}$.  But a locale map $X \to S_{disc}$ is precisely a decomposition of $X$ into disjoint opens indexed by $S$, which exactly defines a map $\pi_0(X) \to S$.

### The classifying locale functor is not an embedding

It is well-known that when restricted to the subcategory $Pro(FinSet)$ of [[profinite sets]], the functor $\lim$ is [[fully faithful]] and in fact lands inside the subcategory of [[topological locales]], its image being the category of [[Stone spaces]].

It is also true that when lifted to [[progroups]], the functor $\lim\colon Pro(Grp) \to Grp(Loc)$ into localic groups is fully faithful when restricted to *strict* or *surjective* progroups (those whose transition maps are surjective).

However, in general the functor $\lim\colon Pro(Set) \to Loc$ is not an embedding.  For a counterexample, consider morphisms $S\to 2$, where $S$ is a pro-set and $2=\{\bot,\top\}$, regarded as a pro-set in the trivial way (and thus giving rise to a discrete locale).  A morphism of pro-sets $S\to 2$ is determined by a partition of some $S_i = S_i^\bot \sqcup S_i^\top$ (modulo a suitable equivalence relation as we change $i$).  But a morphism of locales $\lim S_i \to 2$ consists of two ideals $A^\bot$ and $A^\top$ which are disjoint and whose union *generates* the improper ideal (which consists of all pairs $(i,x)$).  A pro-set morphism $S\to 2$ induces a locale map $\lim S_i \to 2$ where $A^\bot$ and $A^\top$ are the ideals generated by $S_i^\bot$ and $S_i^\top$, but in general not every  morphism $\lim S_i \to 2$ is induced by one $S\to 2$.

Specifically, consider the following pro-set, which is indexed on the natural numbers with the inverse ordering:
$$ \dots \to S_i \to \dots \to S_2 \to S_1 \to S_0 $$
We define $S_i = (\mathbb{N} \times \{a,b\}) / \sim_i$, where $\sim_i$ is the equivalence relation generated by $(k,a)\sim_i (k,b)$ for $k\ge i$.  The transition maps are the obvious projections, which are surjective.  Define
$$ A^\bot = \{ (i,(k,a)) | k \lt i \} \quad\text{and}\quad A^\top = \{ (i,(k,b) | k \lt i \}.$$
Then $A^\bot \cup A^\top$ generates the improper ideal, since for any $i$ we have $\{ (i+1, (i,a)), (i+1,(i,b)) \} \subset A^\bot \cup A^\top$, which covers $(i,(i,?))$, which covers $(i-1,(i,?))$, and so on down to $(0,(i,?))$.  However, no $S_i$ can be partitioned as $S_i = S_i^\bot \sqcup S_i^\top$ in such a way that $S_i^\bot$ generates $A^\bot$ and $S_i^\top$ generates $A^\top$.  Thus, this defines a locale map $\lim S_i \to 2$ which does not arise from a pro-set morphism $S\to 2$.
