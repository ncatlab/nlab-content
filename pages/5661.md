## Definition

Often, by a **natural equivalence** is meant specifically an [[equivalence]] in a [[2-category]] of [[2-functors]].

But more generally it is an [[equivalence]] between any kind of [[functors]] in [[higher category theory]]:

* In 1-[[category theory]] it is a [[natural isomorphism]].

 * In [[(∞,1)-category theory]] a natural equivalence is an [[equivalence in an (∞,1)-category]] in an [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-functors]].

The components of a  natural equivalence  are [[equivalences]] between the [[objects]] in the codomain of the functors. This is what the term "natural equivalence" refers to: its a collection of equivalences between objects which are compatible ("natural") with the [[morphisms]] between these objects, and higher morphisms between those.
