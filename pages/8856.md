Given a commutative unital ring $k$ and a morphism $D\to C$ of $k$-coalgebras, one can consider the dualized notion of induced module, using the [[cotensor product]] instead of tensor product.

If $D$ is [[flat module|flat]] as a $k$-module (e.g. $k$ is a field),
and $N$ a left $D$- right $C$-bicomodule,
then the cotensor product $N \Box M$ is a $D$-subcomodule of
$N \otimes_k M$. In particular, under the flatness assumption, if $\pi : D \rightarrow C$ is a surjection of
coalgebras then $D$ is a left $D$- right $C$-bicomodule
via $\Delta_D$ and $(\id \otimes \pi) \circ \Delta_D$
respectively, hence $\mathrm{Ind}^D_C := D \Box^C -$
is a functor from left $C$- to left
$D$-comodules called the induction functor for left comodules from $C$ to $D$. 

One can consider this construction more generally for [[coring]]s.
