Here we discuss two things: the relation and stand of $n$Lab, $n$Forum and related projects and our $n$-community toward the copyright issues and the copyright issues and literature (mainly in science) in general. 

### nLab and copyright

While $n$Lab is free to use the usual practices of dealing with the original work of others are assumed, like citing original research and so on. $n$Lab cites, links and uses the work of other following also established practices for non-commercial and scientific uses. Some of the issues are at [[General Discussion]]. 

The ideology of most of the principal contributors of $n$Lab is that scientific results should be freely distributed and fairly acknowledged. We try to foster this by our own example and release of our own contribution. We encourage finding free or inexpensive sources, alternative versions and other material which will enhance the scope of work available to as many interested people as possible. 

While providing easier access to material in $n$Lab might seem to some commercial publishers to be a competition to them, we do count that many users of $n$Lab have the access to commercial resources, and we do often also make detailed and correct 
links or hints to the latter. This way, as a byproduct, our bibliographies in $n$Lab do make also some favor to commercial publishers, with hopefully primary satisfaction of their users. We do not consider our citations being an advertisement for the publisher, but a neutral information for end users.

#### We abide the law 

However, we do not do any "revolution" nor we intend to break the law. One tries to stretch the freedom of distribution of scientific work as much as possible, but without getting into risks of compromising our effort or making our links and resources unstable and unsecure. Namely, providing illegal links would make them subject to future removal, what would make the resources just temporary and any link and document structure related to such links ephemeral. The fact that we abide to the rules does not mean that we support their ideology. While we support the persecution of plagiarism, and protection of **authors**, most of the contributors consider the system of journals which get the work of authors for free and then charge for access immoral and support the alternative to the present system. Also we consider the present time extent of author's commercial rights to typically 75 years after publication and/or 25 after the death (in some countries **maximum** of the two, so it may be over 75 after the death of the author, if the book is published about the date of death of the author !!), rather extreme for creative heritage of humanity to develop optimally and beneficial for our culture, or even to benefit the very authors themselves. We also distinguish strongly between the rights of the authors and of their one-time publishers, which often blackmail the first in the scientific publication market.

We sharply distinguish between the usage of work of others for personal and scientific issues from the commercial usage. Moreover, we consider that intellectual texts can be studied in depth by their users, including translating for personal use, reverse-engineer (e.g. in the case of software), analyse by machine-analysers, and use as a data for computer experiments. If one has a legal access to a source of information, its reading includes reading by any level of intelligence and data analysis, human or machine. 

### Copyright issues in natural sciences and mathematics

While in court it is easier to win if somebody had a prior registration of copyright in a copyright office, in principle most of the copyright laws and patent laws in provable cases give advantage to the **factual priority** of the work, even if non-registered. That is, every author's work is a priori protected from the moment of creation; the registration at a copyright office just makes it easier to prove the priority in disputes. 

According to some historians and anti-copyright activists the copyright in 19th and early 20th century was mainly working toward the authors, while today it is structure in a way which is mainly protecting the publishers, and less the authors. In particular, often the authors loose the battles with their own publishers in attempts of making parts of their work free or published in a form which they prefer.
