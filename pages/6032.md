Some past material on copyright issues of $n$Lab from the unofficial point of view of one $n$Laber see [[zoranskoda:copyright of nLab|here]].

Here we discuss general copyright issues and literature (mainly in science) in general.

## Copyright issues in natural sciences and mathematics

While in court it is easier to win if somebody had a prior registration of copyright in a copyright office, in principle most of the copyright laws and patent laws in provable cases give advantage to the *factual priority* of the work, even if not registered. That is, every author's work is a priori protected from the moment of creation; the registration at a copyright office just makes it easier to prove the priority in disputes.

According to some historians and anti-copyright activists, the copyright in the 19th and early 20th centuries mainly worked for the authors, while today it is structured in a way which is protects the publishers and less the authors. In particular, often the authors loose battles with their own publishers in attempts to make parts of their work free or published in a form which they prefer.
