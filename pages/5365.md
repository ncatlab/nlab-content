## Idea

An _cell complex_ is an [[object]] in a [[category]] which is obtained by successively "gluing cells" via [[pushouts]].

## Definition

Let $C$ be a [[category]] with [[colimits]] and equipped with a [[set]] $\mathcal{I} \subset Mor(C)$ of [[morphisms]].

In practice $C$ is usually a [[cofibrantly generated model category]] with set $\mathcal{I}$ of generating cofibrations and set $\mathcal{J}$ of acyclic generating cofibrations. 

An _$\mathcal{I}$-cell complex_ in $C$ is an [[object]] $X$ which is connected to the [[initial object]] $\emptyset \to X$  by a [[transfinite composition]] of [[pushouts]] of the generating cofibrations in $\mathcal{I}$.

A _relative $\mathcal{I}$-cell complex_ (relative to any object $A$) is any morphism $A \to X$ obtained this starting from $A$.


## Examples

* A [[CW-complex]] is a cell complex in [[Top]] with respect to the generating cofibrations in the standard [[model structure on topological spaces]].

* Every [[simplicial set]] is a cell complex with respect to the generating cofibrations in the standard [[model structure on simplicial sets]].

* A [[Sullivan model]] is a cell complex with respect to the generating cofibrations in the standard [[model structure on dg-algebras]].
