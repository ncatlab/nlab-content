## Idea

On a [[complex analytic space]] $\Sigma$, the _holomorphic de Rham complex_ is the restriction of the [[de Rham complex]] to [[holomorphic differential forms]] $\Omega^p$

$$
  \mathcal{O}_X \stackrel{\partial}{\longrightarrow} \Omega^1 \stackrel{\partial}{\longrightarrow} \Omega^2 \longrightarrow \cdots 
  \,.
$$

Notice here that since $\Omega^k$ denotes the holomorphic forms, this is the [[kernel]] of the [[Dolbeault operator]] $\par \partial$ and hence the [[de Rham differential]] $\mathbf{d} = \partial + \bar \partial$ restricts to the holomorphic component $\partial$ as above.

Often considered is a version of this with singularities ("logarithmic de Rham complex") where one consideres instead meromorphic differential forms which are holomorphic in the bulk with logarithmic singularities towards compactification boundaries of $X$.
