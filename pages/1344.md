## Definition

### Category of simplices

The **category of simplices** of a [[simplicial set]] $X_\bullet : \Delta^{op} \to Set$ is the [[category of elements]] of the [[presheaf]] $X_\bullet$. 

In more detail, the category of simplices is the [[comma category]] $(\Delta\downarrow X)$, where $\Delta$ denotes the [[Yoneda embedding]] $[n] \mapsto \Delta^n$.

The [[object]]s of the category of simplices are therefore morphisms $c : \Delta^n \to X$ from a standard simplicial [[simplex]] $\Delta^n$ to $X$, hence are $n$-cells of $X$, while morphisms $c \to c'$ are morphisms $f : \Delta^n \to \Delta^{n'}$ in the [[simplex category]] $\Delta$ such that

$$
  \array{ 
    \Delta^n &&\stackrel{f}{\to}&& \Delta^{n'}
    \\
    & {}_{c}\searrow && \swarrow_{c'}  
    \\
    && X
  }
  \,.
$$

### Category of nondegenerate simplices

An $n$-[[simplex]] $x\in X_n$ is said to be *nondegenerate* if it is not in the image of any degeneracy map.  When $x$ is regarded, via the 
[[Yoneda lemma]], as a morphism $\Delta^n \to X$, this means that this morphism is a [[monomorphism]] of simplicial sets.

Therefore, the [[full subcategory]] $(\Delta\downarrow X)_{nondeg}\hookrightarrow (\Delta\downarrow X)$ on the nondegenerate simplices consists of the monomorphisms $\Delta^n \hookrightarrow X$.  Note that the morphisms in this subcategory are only the coface maps.

Now the [[presheaf topos]] [[sSet]] has [[image]] factorization, and the image of a map $x\colon \Delta^n \to X$ is the map $\Delta^k \to X$ that represents the unique nondegenerate simplex of which $x$ is a degeneracy.  It follows that this factorization is a [[left adjoint]] to the inclusion $(\Delta\downarrow X)_{nondeg}\hookrightarrow (\Delta\downarrow X)$, so that $(\Delta\downarrow X)_{nondeg}$ is a [[reflective subcategory]].

In particular, the inclusion $(\Delta\downarrow X)_{nondeg}\hookrightarrow (\Delta\downarrow X)$ is a [[final functor]], in fact even a [[homotopy final functor]].  Thus, the above colimits that compute cocontinuous functors on $SSet$ work equally well using only the category of nondegenerate simplices.

## Properties

* The category of simplices is a [[Reedy category]].

* The [[full subcategory]] inclusion of the non-degenerate simplices is a [[homotopy cofinal functor]] (see there).

## Applications

By the [[co-Yoneda lemma]], every simplicial set is isomorphic to the colimit of the standard simplices over its category of simplices:
$$ X \cong colim_{(\Delta\downarrow X)} \Delta^\bullet $$
Therefore, a colimit-preserving [[functor]] $F\colon SSet \to C$ is uniquely determined by its action on the standard simplices:
$$ F(X) \cong colim_{(\Delta\downarrow X)} F(\Delta^\bullet). $$
Examples abound:

* [[geometric realization]] of simplicial sets
* [[subdivision]] of simplicial sets
* the left adjoint to the [[nerve]] functor $N:Cat \to SSet$
* the category of simplices itself, as a functor $SSet \to Cat$; see [here](/nlab/show/category+of+elements#ColimitPreserving).



## The nerve and the subdivision

Let $N\colon Cat \to SSet$ denote the simplicial [[nerve]] functor.

###### Theorem
The functor $X\mapsto N(\Delta\downarrow X)$ from $SSet\to\SSet$ preserves colimits.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
An $n$-simplex of $N(\Delta\downarrow X)$ is determined by a string of $n+1$ composable morphisms
$$ \Delta^{k_n} \to \dots\to \Delta^{k_0} $$
along with a map $\Delta^{k_0} \to X$, i.e. an element of $X_{k_0}$
Thus, each the functor $X\mapsto N(\Delta\downarrow X)_n$ from $SSet \to Set$ is a coproduct of a family of "evaluation" functors.
Since evaluation preserve colimits, coproducts commute with colimits, and colimits in $SSet$ are levelwise, the statement follows.

Therefore, the simplicial set $N(\Delta\downarrow X)$ itself can be computed as a colimit over the category $(\Delta\downarrow X)$ of the simplicial sets $N(\Delta\downarrow \Delta^n)$.
