## Idea

[[twisted cohomology|twisted]] [[differential cohomology]]

## Examples

* [[twisted differential K-theory]]

## References

A definition in terms of [[smooth spectra]] (such as discussed at _[[differential cohomology diagram]]_) is due to

* [[Ulrich Bunke]], [[Thomas Nikolaus]], _Twisted differential cohomology_ ([arXiv:1406.3231](http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3231))

For discussion of twisted differential cohomology as the intrinsic [[cohomology]] of _[[tangent cohesive (∞,1)-topos|Goodwillie-tangent spaces of cohesive (∞,1)-topos]]_ see there.
