## Definition

An **accessible model category** is a [[model structure]] on a [[locally presentable category]] whose two [[weak factorization systems]] can be realized by [[functorial factorizations]] that are [[accessible functors]].

This implies that in fact its weak factorization systems can be enhanced to [[algebraic weak factorization systems]] that are also accessible.
