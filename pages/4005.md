## Idea

The **Hawaiian earring space** is a famous counterexample in [[algebraic topology]] which shows the need for care in hypotheses to develop a good theory of [[covering space]]s. 

It is an example of a space which is not [[semi-locally simply connected space|semi-locally simply connected]]. 

## Definition

The Hawaiian earring space is the [[topological space]] defined to be the set 

$$\bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \{(x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^2: (x - 1/2^n)^2 + y^2 = 1/2^{2n}\}$$

endowed with [[subspace topology]] inherited from $\mathbb{R}^2$. 

More abstractly: the Hawaiian earring space can be described up to [[homeomorphism]] as the [[one-point compactification]] of a [[coproduct]] (in [[Top]]; a [[disjoint union space]]) of [[countably infinite set|countably]] many open [[intervals]]. This shows that the specific radii converging to zero (which was taken to be $1/2^n$ above) don't actually matter. 

Every neighborhood of $(0, 0)$ has non-contractible loops inside it (this would not be the case under the CW topology, i.e., the evident [[quotient space]] of countably many circles with the [[coproduct]] or [[disjoint union topological space|disjoint sum topology]], making the result a countable bouquet of circles). 

Viewed in terms of [[general topology]], it would be hard to sell the Hawaiian earring as a genuinely "pathological space": it is [[compactum|compact, Hausdorff]], [[connected space|connected and locally path-connected]], etc. It's really through the lens of algebraic topology and particularly the classical theory of covering spaces that it seems strange (it is not a [[CW complex]], it is not semi-locally simply connected, its [[fundamental group]] is hard to compute).
