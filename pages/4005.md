## Idea

The **Hawaiian earring space** is a famous counterexample in [[topology]] which shows the need for care in hypotheses to develop a good theory of [[covering space]]s. 

It is an example of a space which is not [[semi-locally simply connected space|semi-locally simply connected]]. 

## Definition

The Hawaiian earring space is the [[topological space]] defined to be the set 

$$\bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \{(x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^2: (x - 1/2^n)^2 + y^2 = 1/2^{2n}\}$$

endowed with [[subspace topology]] inherited from $\mathbb{R}^2$. 

Every neighborhood of $(0, 0)$ has non-contractible loops inside it (this would not be the case under the [[CW topology]], where the result would be a countable bouquet of circles).
