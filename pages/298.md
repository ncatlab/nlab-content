## Idea

The usual definition of _vertex operator algebra_ (VOA) is long and unenlightening. But due to work by Huang and Kong it is now known that vertex operator algebras are equivalent to certain [[FQFT]]s (see also [[CFT]]):

There is a [[monoidal category]] or [[operad]] whose [[morphism|morphisms]] are conformal spheres with $n$-punctures marked as incoming and one puncture marked as outgoing (each puncture equipped with a conformally parametrized annular neighborhood). Composition of such spheres is by gluing along punctures. This can be regarded as a category $2Cob_{conf}^0$ of 2-dimensional genus-0 conformal [[cobordism|cobordisms]].

As shown by theorems by Yi-Zhi Huang and Liang Kong, a vertex operator algebra is precisely a _[[holomorphic representation]]_ of this category, or [[algebra over an operad]] for this [[operad]] i.e. an genus-0 [[conformal field theory|conformal]] [[FQFT]], hence a [[monoidal functor]]

$$
  V : 2Cob_{conf}^0 \to Vect
$$

such that its component $V_1$ is a holomorphic function on the moduli space of conformal punctured spheres.

## Standard definition

(under construction) A __vertex algebra__ consists of the following data:

* nonnegatively graded complex vector space $V = \oplus_{n =0}^\infty V_n$
* vacuum vector $|0\rangle\in V_0$
* a shift operator $T: V\to V$ 
* operation $Y = Y(-,z) : V\to End V [ [z,z^{-1}] ]$ 



This data satisfy three axioms: 

(vacuum)

(translation axiom)

(locality)

In practice, the most important case is when the shift is $T$ is related to a conformal vector "the energy momentum tensor" $\omega$ whose Fourier components are related to the generators $L_i$ of the [[Virasoro Lie algebra]] $Vir$. In that case we talk about __conformal vertex algebra__.

There is a notion of a module over a vertex algebra. A conformal vertex algebra $A$ is said to be __rational__ if every $A$-module is completely reducible. Then it follows that there are only finitely many nonisomorphic simple $A$-modules.

More recently Huang's student Liang Kong has been developing these results further, generalizing them to open-closed CFTs and to non-chiral, i.e. completely general CFTs. See
