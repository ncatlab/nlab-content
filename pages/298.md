## Idea

The usual definition of _vertex operator algebra_ (VOA) is long and unenlightning. But due to work by Huang and Kong it is now known that vertex operator algebras are equivalent to certain [[FQFT]]s (see also [[CFT]]):

There is a [[monoidal category]] or [[operad]] whose [[morphism|morphisms]] are conformal spheres with $n$-punctures marked as incoming and one puncture marked as outgoing (each puncture equipped with a conformally parametrized annular neighborhood). Composition of such spheres is by gluing along puctures. This can be regarded as a category $2Cob_{conf}^0$ of 2-dimensional genus-0 conformal [[cobordism|cobordisms]].

As shown by theorems by Yi-Zhi Huang and Lian Kong, a vertex operator algebra is precisely a _[[holomorphic representation]]_ of this category, or [[algebra over an operad]] for this [[operad]] i.e. an genus-0 [[conformal field theory|conformal]] [[FQFT]], hence a [[monoidal functor]]

  V : 2Cob_{conf}^0 \to Vect
$$

such that its component $V_1$ is a holomorphic function on the moduli space of conformal punctured spheres.

Other operadic approaches are known, e.g. the earlier one in

More recently Huang's student Liang Kong has been developing these results further, generalizing them to open-closed CFTs and to non-chiral, i.e. completely general CFTs. See
