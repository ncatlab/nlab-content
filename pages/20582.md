## Idea

A [[homomorphism]] between [[simplicial sets]] $X \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} Y$ is a sequence of [[functions]] between [[sets]] $X_n \overset{f_n}{\longrightarrow} Y_n$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, commuting with the [[face]] and [[degeneracy]] maps.

These are the [[morphisms]] in the [[category of simplicial sets]].
