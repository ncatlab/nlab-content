## Idea

The _Narasimhan–Seshadri theorem_ identifies certain 
[[moduli spaces of flat connections]] over a [[Riemann surface]] $\Sigma$ with [[complex manifolds]] of [[stable vector bundles]] over $\Sigma$.

## Applications

### In Quantum field theory

In [[gauge field theories]] such as notably [[Chern-Simons theory]], moduli spaces of flat connections may appear as [[phase spaces]]. The Narasimhan–Seshadri theorem then provides a [[complex structure]] on these phase spaces and thus a [[spin^c structure]] (see there). This is the data required to obatain the [[geometric quantization by push-forward]] of the phase space.
