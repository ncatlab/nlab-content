A [[subspace]] $A$ of a [[space]] $X$ is __closed__ if the [[inclusion function|inclusion map]] $A \hookrightarrow X$ is a [[closed map]].

For a point-based notion of space such as a [[topological space]], a closed subspace is the same thing as a __closed subset__.

In [[locale]] theory, every open $U$ in the locale defines a closed subspace which is given by the __closed [[nucleus]]__
$$ j_{U'}\colon V \mapsto U \cup V .$$
The idea is that this subspace is the part of $X$ which does not involve $U$ (hence the notation $U'$, or any other notation for a [[complement]]), and we may identify $V$ with $U \cup V$ when we are looking only away from $U$.

(There is a lot more to say, about convergence spaces, smooth spaces, etc.)
