A [[subspace]] $A$ of a [[space]] $X$ is __closed__ if the [[inclusion function|inclusion map]] $A \hookrightarrow X$ is an [[closed map]].

For a point-based notion of space such as a [[topological space]], a closed subspace is the same thing as a __closed subset__.

(There is a lot more to say, about convergence spaces, locales, smooth spaces, etc, but right now I just want to get the redirects in.)
