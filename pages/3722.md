## Definition

A [[subspace]] $A$ of a [[space]] $X$ is __closed__ if the [[inclusion function|inclusion map]] $A \hookrightarrow X$ is a [[closed map]].

The __closure__ of any subspace $A$ is the smallest closed subspace that contains $A$, that is the [[intersection]] of all open subspaces of $A$.  The closure of $A$ is variously denoted $Cl(A)$, $Cl_X(A)$, $\bar{A}$, $\overline{A}$, etc. Since closed subsets are closed with respect to finite unions, we in fact have $Cl(A \cup B) = Cl(A) \cup Cl(B)$. 


(There is a lot more to say, about [[convergence spaces]], [[smooth spaces]], [[schemes]], etc.)


### Topological spaces

For a point-based notion of space such as a [[topological space]], a closed subspace is the same thing as a __closed subset__.

A subset is closed precisely if

* it contains all its [[limit points]] (in either sense). 

A topological closure operator is a [[Moore closure]] operator $Cl: P(X) \to P(X)$ that preserves finite unions ($Cl(0) = 0$ and $Cl(A \cup B) = Cl(A) \cup Cl(B)$), and in fact it is easy to see that all such closure operators come from a topology whose closed sets are the fixed points of $Cl$. 

#### Kuratowski's closure-complement problem 

This mildly amusing curiosity asks how many set-theoretic operations on a topological space $X$ are derivable from closure $C$ and [[complementation]] $\neg$ and applying finite composition. The answer is that at most 14 operations are so derivable (and there are examples showing this number is achievable). 

Let $P(X)$ denote the [[power set]] (ordered by [[subset|inclusion]]) and $M$ the [[monoid]] of [[endofunctions]] $P(X) \to P(X)$ with order defined pointwise. Then $C^2 = C$ and $\neg^2 = 1$ in $M$, with $C$ order-preserving and $\neg$ order-reversing. Also 

* $I \coloneqq \neg C \neg$ is the [[interior]] operation, with $I \leq Id$.

###### Proposition 
$C \neg C \neg$ is [[idempotent element|idempotent]].

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
$I (C \neg C) \leq (C \neg C)$, i.e., $\neg C \neg C \neg C \leq C \neg C$. Applying the order-preserving operation $C$ to both sides together with the fact that $C^2 = C$, this gives 

$$C\neg C \neg C \neg C \leq C C \neg C = C \neg C.$$ 

Since $I C \leq C$, we have also $\neg C \neg C \leq C$. Applying the order-reversing operation $C \neg C$ to both sides, we obtain 

$$C \neg C = C \neg C C \leq C \neg C (\neg C \neg C).$$ 

Combining the two displayed inequalities gives $C \neg C = C \neg C \neg C \neg C$, and then multiplying this on the right by $\neg$, the proposition follows.

###### Proposition 
Let $M$ be the monoid presented by two generators $C, \neg$ and subject to the relations $C^2 = C$, $\neg^2 = 1$, and $C \neg C \neg C \neg C = C \neg C$. Then $M$ has at most 14 elements.

###### Proof 
We may apply an obvious reduction algorithm on the set of words in two letters $C, \neg$, in which a word is reduced by replacing any substring $C C$ by $C$ and any substring $\neg\neg$ by an empty substring, so that any word which cannot be further reduced must be alternating in $C, \neg$. This leads to a list of 14 words 

$$1, \qquad \neg, \qquad C, \qquad \neg C, \qquad C \neg, \qquad \neg C \neg, \qquad C \neg C, $$ 

$$\,$$ 

$$\neg C \neg C, \qquad C \neg C \neg, \qquad \neg C \neg C \neg, \qquad C \neg C \neg C, \qquad \neg C \neg C \neg C, \qquad C \neg C \neg C \neg, \qquad \neg C \neg C \neg C \neg $$ 

with any further alternating words reducible by replacing a substring $C \neg C \neg C \neg C$ by $C \neg C$. Thus each element in the monoid presented as above is represented by one of these 14 words. 
=-- 

These 14 words actually name distinct set-theoretic operations $P(X) \to P(X)$ for a judicious choice of space $X$ (and as a corollary, the monoid presented above has exactly 14 elements). For instance (courtesy of Wikipedia), taking $X = \mathbb{R}$ with its standard topology, the orbit of the element $(0, 1) \cup (1, 2) \cup \{3\} \cup ([4, 5] \cap \mathbb{Q})$ under the monoid action consists of 14 distinct elements. 

### Locales

In [[locale]] theory, every open $U$ in the locale defines a closed subspace which is given by the __closed [[nucleus]]__
$$ j_{U'}\colon V \mapsto U \cup V .$$
The idea is that this subspace is the part of $X$ which does not involve $U$ (hence the notation $U'$, or any other notation for a [[complement]]), and we may identify $V$ with $U \cup V$ when we are looking only away from $U$.
