## Definition

A [[2-category]] $K$ has three different [[opposite category|opposites]] (two independent):

* The **$1$-cell dual** $K^{op}$, in which the $1$-cells but not the $2$-cells are reversed.
* The **$2$-cell dual** $K^{co}$, in which the $2$-cells but not the $1$-cells are reversed.
* The **bidual** $K^{co op}$ in which both $1$-cells and $2$-cells are reversed.
