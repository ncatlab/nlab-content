A **symmetric monoidal $\dagger$-category** is a [[symmetric monoidal category]] that is also a $\dagger$-[[dagger-category|category]] for which:

1. $(f \otimes g)^\dagger = f^\dagger \otimes g^\dagger$ for every pair of [[morphisms]] $f,g$

1. the [[associator]], left and right [[unitor|unitors]], and [[braiding]] are all [[unitary morphism|unitary]].
