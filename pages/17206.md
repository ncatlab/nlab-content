
##For groups

A composition series for a group, $G$,  is a subnormal series, (that is, a sequence of subgroups, each a normal subgroup of the next one) such that each factor group $H_{i+1} / H_i$ is a [[simple group]]. 



##In an abelian category

An object $X$ of an [[abelian category]]  has a [[composition series]] if there is a chain  of [[subobjects]]

$$0= X_0 \lt X_1 \lt\ldots  \lt X_{n-1} \lt X_n = X$$

such that $X_i / X_{i-1}$ is [[simple object|simple]] for $1\leq i\leq n$.
