## Idea

A _submanifold_ is a [[manifold]] inside another manifold.

## Definition

For a homomorphism of [[differentiable manifolds]]

$$
  X \hookrightarrow Y
$$

to qualify as a submanifold inclusion it is usually required to be an [[embedding of differentiable manifolds]], hence

1. an [[embedding of topological spaces]];

1. an [[immersion of differentiable manifolds]].
