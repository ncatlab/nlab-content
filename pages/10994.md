The term _arrow_ is sometimes used as a synonym for _[[morphism]]_, _[[map]]_, and also for directed edge (in a [[directed graph]] or [[quiver]]).

In [[computer science]] it may also refer to a concept generalizing [[monad (in computer science)|monads]], see at _[[arrow (in computer science)]]_.

Abbreviations for the class of all arrows of a category $\mathsf{C}$ used in the literature: $\mathrm{Ar}(\mathsf{C})$, $\mathrm{Mor}(\mathsf{C})$.

With the notation used in [[arrow category]] one has $\mathrm{Ob}(\mathrm{Arr}(\mathsf{C}))=\mathrm{Ar}(\mathsf{C})$. 

In view of the existing notation $\mathrm{Arr}(\mathsf{C})$ for a full-fledged _category_, while the $\mathrm{Ar}(\mathsf{C})$ refers to a structureless _class_, the notation $\mathrm{Mor}(\mathsf{C})$ is perhaps preferable.
