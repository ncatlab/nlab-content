## Idea

A bialgebroid may be viewed as a multiobject generalization of a concept of a [[bialgebra]], or as a space-algebra dual version of the concept of an internal category in spaces.

#### Nomenclature

This entry is about "associative" bialgebroid, see also the different concept of a [[Lie bialgebroid]]. 

#### Motivation in Tannakian formalism

When a monoidal category has a [[fiber functor]] to a category of vector spaces over a field, one tries to "reconstruct" the category as the category of representations of the endomorphism object of a fiber functor. One often does not have a fiber functor to vector spaces but only to bimodules over some base algebra $A$. Sometimes in such cases, the object of endomorphisms of the fiber functor form a bialgebroid over $A$ and the category is equivalent to the category of representations of that bialgebroid

## Definition

Given a unital (possibly noncommutative) ring $R$ an __$R$-bialgebroid__ is an $R$-$R$-bimodule $H$ (object of ${}_R \mathcal{M}_R$) equipped with a structure of a comonoid in ${}_R \mathcal{M}_R$ (i.e. an $R$-coring) and of a monoid in ${}_{R^e}\mathcal{M}_{R^e}$ (i.e. an $R^e$-ring), where $R^e = R^{op}\otimes R$ is the enveloping ring of $R$; and the structures of a monoid and a comonoid satisfy certain compatibility conditions. These compatibility conditions are equivalent to the fact that the monad ${}_\otimes_{R^e} H : \mathcal{M}_{R^e}\to \mathcal{M}_{R^e}$ is [[opmonoidal monad|opmonoidal]]. The category of $R$-comodules is by the definition the category of comodules over the underlying $R$-coring.

#### Commutative case

The commutative case is rather classical. See for example the appendix to

#### Noncommutative case

The first version of a bialgebroid over a noncommutative base was more narrow:

A modern generality, but in different formalism is due Takeuchi, under the name of $\times_A$-bialgebra
