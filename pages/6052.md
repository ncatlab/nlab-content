## Idea

A bialgebroid may be viewed as a multiobject generalization of a concept of a bialgebra, or as a space-algebra dual version of the concept of an internal category in spaces.

#### Nomenclature

This entry is about "associative" bialgebroid, see also the different concept of a [[Lie bialgebroid]]. 

#### Motivation in Tannakian formalism

When a monoidal category has a [[fiber functor]] to a category of vector spaces over a field, one tries to "reconstruct" the category as the category of representations of the endomorphism object of a fiber functor. One often does not have a fiber functor to vector spaces but only to bimodules over some base algebra $A$. Sometimes in such cases, the object of endomorphisms of the fiber functor form a bialgebroid over $A$ and the category is equivalent to the category of representations of that bialgebroid

## Literature

The commutative case is rather classical.

The first version of a bialgebroid over a noncommutative base was more narrow:

A modern generality, but in different formalism is due Taleuchi, under the name of $\times_A$-bialgebra
