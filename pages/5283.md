## Definitiion

For $X$ a [[smooth manifold]] and $T X$ its [[tangent bundle]] a **multivector field** on $X$ is an element of the [[exterior algebra]] bundle $\wedge^\bullet_{C^\infty(X)}(\Gamma(T X))$ of skew-symmetric [[tensor power]]s of [[section]]s of $T X$.

* In degree 0 this are the [[smooth function]]s on $X$.

* In degree 1 this are the ordinary [[vector field]]s on $X$.

## Properties

### Hochschild cohomology

In suitable contexts, multivector fields on $X$ can be identified with the [[Hochschild cohomology]] $HH^\bullet(C(X), C(X))$ of the algebra of functions on $X$.

### Schouten bracket

There is a canonical bilinear pairing on multivector fields called the [[Schouten bracket]].
