## Definition

For $X$ a [[smooth manifold]] and $T X$ its [[tangent bundle]] a **multivector field** on $X$ is an element of the [[exterior algebra]] bundle $\wedge^\bullet_{C^\infty(X)}(\Gamma(T X))$ of skew-symmetric [[tensor power]]s of [[section]]s of $T X$.

* In degree $0$ these are simply the [[smooth function]]s on $X$.

* In degree $1$ these are simply the [[tangent vector field]]s on $X$.

* In degree $p$ these are sometimes called the __$p$-vector fields__ on $X$.


## Properties

### Hochschild cohomology

In suitable contexts, multivector fields on $X$ can be identified with the [[Hochschild cohomology]] $HH^\bullet(C(X), C(X))$ of the algebra of functions on $X$.


### Schouten bracket

There is a canonical bilinear pairing on multivector fields called the [[Schouten bracket]].

### Isomorphisms with de Rham complex

Let $X$ be a [[smooth manifold]] of [[dimension]] $d$, which is equipped with an [[orientation]] exhibited by a [[differential form]]
$\omega \in \Omega^d(X)$.

Then contraction with $\omega$ induces for all $0 \leq n \leq d$ an [[isomorphism]] of [[vector space]]s

$$
  \omega(-) : 
  T^n_{poly}(X)
    \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  \Omega^{(d-n)}(X)
  \,.
$$

The transport of the [[de Rham complex|de Rham differential]] along these isomorphism equips $T^\bullet_{poly}$ with the structure of a [[chain complex]]

$$
  \array{
    \Omega^{n}(X) &\stackrel{d_{dR}}{\to}& \Omega^{n+1}(X)
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
      &&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    \\
    T^{d-n}_{poly} &\stackrel{div_\omega}{\to}&
    T^{d-n-1}_{poly} 
  }
  \,,
$$

The operation $div_\omega$ is a [[derivation]] of the [[Schouten bracket]].
