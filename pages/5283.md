## Definition

For $X$ a [[smooth manifold]] and $T X$ its [[tangent bundle]] a **multivector field** on $X$ is an element of the [[exterior algebra]] bundle $\wedge^\bullet_{C^\infty(X)}(\Gamma(T X))$ of skew-symmetric [[tensor power]]s of [[section]]s of $T X$.

* In degree $0$ these are simply the [[smooth function]]s on $X$.

* In degree $1$ these are simply the [[tangent vector field]]s on $X$.

* In degree $p$ these are sometimes called the __$p$-vector fields__ on $X$.


## Properties

### Hochschild cohomology

In suitable contexts, multivector fields on $X$ can be identified with the [[Hochschild cohomology]] $HH^\bullet(C(X), C(X))$ of the algebra of functions on $X$.


### Schouten bracket

There is a canonical bilinear pairing on multivector fields called the [[Schouten bracket]].
