## Idea

The _state monad_ is a [[monad (in computer science)]] used to implement computational side-effects in [[functional programming]].

A [[functional program]] with input of [[type]] $X$, output of [[type]] $Y$ and mutable state type $W$ is a [[function]] ([[morphism]]) of [[type]] $X \times W \longrightarrow Y \times W$. 

Under the ([[Cartesian product]] $\dashv$ [[internal hom]])-[[adjunction]] this is equivalently given by its [[adjunct]], which is a function of type 

$$
  X \longrightarrow [W, W \times Y ]
 \,.
$$

Here the operation $[W, W\times (-)]$ is the [[monad]] on the type system which is induced by the above adjunction; and this latter function is naturally regarded as a morphism in the [[Kleisli category]] of this monad. 

In the context of [[monad (in computer science)|monads in computer science]], this monad $[W, W\times (-)] \colon \mathbf{H} \to \mathbf{H}$ is called the _state monad_ for mutable states of type $W$.

## Properties

### Realization in dependent type theory

In a [[locally Cartesian closed category]]/[[dependent type theory]] $\mathbf{H}$, then to every type $W$ is associated its [[base change]] [[adjoint triple]]

$$
  \mathbf{H}_{/W}
   \stackrel{\overset{\sum_W}{\longrightarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{W^\ast}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{\prod_S}{\longrightarrow}}}
  \mathbf{H}
  \,.
$$

In terms of this the state monad is the composite

$$
  State = \prod_W W^\ast \sum_W W^\ast
$$

of [[context extension]] followed by [[dependent sum]], followed by [[context extension]], followed by [[dependent product]].

Here $\prod_W W^\ast = [W,-]$ is called the _[[function monad]]_ or _[[reader monad]]_.
