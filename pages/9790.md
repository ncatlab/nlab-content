
The _product law_ or _product rule_ or _Leibniz rule_ of [[differentiation]] says that for $f,g : X \to \mathbb{R}$ two [[differentiable functions]] and $f g$ their (pointwise) product the [[derivative]] of their product is

$$
  d (f  g) = (d f) g + f (d g)
  \,.
$$

Generalized to [[differential forms]] the product law says that $d$ is a [[derivation]] of degree +1 on the graded commutative algebra of differential forms.
