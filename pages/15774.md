[[!redirects Siegel modular forms]]


## Idea

_Siegel modular forms_ are one generalization of [[modular forms]] to functions in more than one complex variable (another such generalization are [[Hilbert modular forms]]). 

Where ordinary modular forms are locally functions on the [[moduli stack of elliptic curves]] over the complex numbers, so Siegel modular forms are locally functions on something like the moduli stack of higher-dimensional complex [[abelian varieties]].
