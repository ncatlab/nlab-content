An ambient category $C$ is just a category from which [[internalization|internal structures]] take their objects and structure morphisms.

If $C$ has extra structure, like being ([[semi-abelian category|semi]]-)[[abelian category|abelian]] or a [[site]], then one can do extra things; this is made precise through the concept of [[doctrine]].

More generally an ambient category could be seen as a 'universe of discourse', as when $C$ is a [[topos]]; see [[foundations]].
