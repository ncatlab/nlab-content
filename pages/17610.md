## Idea

The [[Einstein equations]] for [[gravity]] in [[dimension]] $\geq 5$ admit [[black hole]] solutions whose [[event horizon]] is not [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to an [[n-sphere]], but has different topology. In particular in 5d-gravity and [[5d supergravity]] there are solutions with topology $S^1 \times S^2$. These are called _black rings_.

Their [[KK-reduction]] down to 4 dimensions yields again ordinary black holes. This plays a central role in the discussion of [[black holes in string theory]].
