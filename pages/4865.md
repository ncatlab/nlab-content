$$
  \int_X
  \left(
  \frac{1}{6} 
  \left(
    C \wedge G \wedge G
    -
    C \wedge
    \frac{1}{8}
    \left(
      p_2 + (\frac{1}{2}p_1)^2 
    \right)
  \right)
  \right)
$$

where $p_i$ is the $i$th [[Pontryagin class]].

$$
  \lambda := \frac{1}{2}p_1
  \,.
$$

Concerning the integrality of

$$
  I_8 := \frac{1}{48}(p_2 + (\lambda)^2)
$$

on a [[spin structure|spin manifold]] $X$.
([Witten96, p.9](#Witten96))

First, the [[index]] of a [[Dirac operator]] on $X$ is

$$
  I = \frac{1}{1440}(7 (\frac{1}{2}p_1)^2 - p_2) \in \mathbb{Z}
  \,.
$$

Notice that $1440 = 6 x 8 x 30$. So

$$
  p_2 - (\frac{1}{2}p_2)^2 = 6 ( (\frac{1}{2}p_1)^2 - 30 x 8 I) 
$$

is divisble by 6. 

Assume that $(\frac{1}{2}p_1)$ is further divisble by 2 (see the relevant discussion at _[[M5-brane]]_).

$$
  (\frac{1}{2}p_1) = 2 x
  \,.
$$

Then the above becomes

$$
  p_2 - (\frac{1}{2}p_2)^2 = 24 ( x^2 - 30 x 2 I) 
$$

and hence then $p_2 + (\frac{1}{2}p_1)^2$ is divisible at least by 24.

But moreover, on a [[spin structure|Spin manifold]]
the [[first fractional Pontryagin class]] $\frac{1}{2}p_1$ is 
the [[Wu class]] $\nu_4$ (see there). By definition this means that

$$
  x^2 = x (\frac{1}{2}p_1) \; mod \; 2
$$

and so when $(\frac{1}{2}p_1)^2$ is further divisible by 2 we have that 
$p_2 - (\frac{1}{2}p_1)^2$ is divisible by 48. Hence $I_8$ is integral.

### Classical solutions
	
Bosonic solutions of eleven-dimensional supergravity were studied in the 1980s in the context of [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|Kaluza-Klein]] supergravity. The topic received renewed attention in the mid-to-late 1990s as a result of the [[branes]] and duality paradigm and the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]].

One of the earliest solutions of eleven-dimensional supergravity is the maximally supersymmetric Freund-Rubin background with geometry $AdS_4 \times S^7$ and 4-form [[flux]] proportional to the [[volume form]] on $AdS_4$.

The radii of curvatures of the two factors are furthermore in a ratio of 1:2. The modern avatar of this solution is as the near-horizon limit of coincident [[M2-branes]].

Shortly after the original Freund-Rubin solution was discovered, Englert discovered a deformation of this solution where one could turn on [[flux]] on the $S^7$; namely, singling out one of the [[Killing spinors]] of the solution, a suitable multiple of the 4-form one constructs by squaring the [[spinor]] can be added to the [[volume form]] in $AdS_4$ and the resulting 4-form still obeys the supergravity [[Euler-Lagrange equations|field equations]], albeit with a different relation between the radii of [[curvature]] of the two factors. The flux breaks the [[special orthogonal group|SO(8)]] symmetry of the [[sphere]] to an $SO(7)$ subgroup.
