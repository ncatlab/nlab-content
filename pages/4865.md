### Classical solutions
	
Bosonic solutions of eleven-dimensional supergravity were studied in the 1980s in the context of [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|Kaluza-Klein]] supergravity. The topic received renewed attention in the mid-to-late 1990s as a result of the [[branes]] and duality paradigm and the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]].

One of the earliest solutions of eleven-dimensional supergravity is the maximally supersymmetric Freund-Rubin background with geometry $AdS_4 \times S^7$ and 4-form [[flux]] proportional to the [[volume form]] on $AdS_4$.

The radii of curvatures of the two factors are furthermore in a ratio of 1:2. The modern avatar of this solution is as the near-horizon limit of coincident [[M2-branes]].

Shortly after the original Freund-Rubin solution was discovered, Englert discovered a deformation of this solution where one could turn on [[flux]] on the $S^7$; namely, singling out one of the [[Killing spinors]] of the solution, a suitable multiple of the 4-form one constructs by squaring the [[spinor]] can be added to the [[volume form]] in $AdS_4$ and the resulting 4-form still obeys the supergravity [[Euler-Lagrange equations|field equations]], albeit with a different relation between the radii of [[curvature]] of the two factors. The flux breaks the [[special orthogonal group|SO(8)]] symmetry of the [[sphere]] to an $SO(7)$ subgroup.
