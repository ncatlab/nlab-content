> this page is eventually intended to provide an idea of the inner workings and aims of the $n$Lab; meant in particular to be such that it provides the required stable background information that may be desired by potential contributors who may wonder whether their contributions are well-invested here

>for the moment all that is here is a link to an "open letter" that arose in discussion between [[Andrew Stacey]] and [[Urs Schreiber]]. 

* [nForum discussion -- organization of the nLab](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Mathforge/nForum/comments.php?DiscussionID=36)


> discussion of this is supposed to take place at the corresponding [nForum](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Mathforge/nForum/) thread, any stable results of this discussion should eventually be implemented here, for everyone to see

Questions that will ultimately be addressed here include:
* How are decisions about the nLab made?
* Who are the nLab administrators?
* What do I do if there is a technical problem?
