# Double pushout rewriting

## Idea

Double pushout rewriting is a [[category theory|category-theoretic]] means of using [[spans]] to "rewrite" [[objects]] in a [[category]] by "deleting" part of them and replacing it with a substitute part that retains some of the same "connections" between the deleted part and the rest of the object.

## Definition

### Linear rewriting in adhesive categories

We work in an [[adhesive category]].  A **linear production** is a [[span]]

$$ L \xleftarrow{l} K \xrightarrow{r} R $$

in which $l$ and $r$ are [[monomorphisms]].  A **match** for thish production is a morphism $f:L\to C$ for some object $C$.  A match satisfies the **gluing condition** if the pair $(l,f)$ has a [[pushout complement]] consisting of $g:K\to E$ and $v:E\to C$.  In this case the **derivation** associated to the match is the pushout of $g$ along $r$, yielding a pair of pushout squares

$$\array{ L & \xleftarrow{l} & K & \xrightarrow{r} & R \\
^f\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{g}} && \downarrow \\
C & \xleftarrow{v}  & E & \to & D.}$$

[Lack and Sobocinski](#LS) describe the intuition in this way:

> in order to perform the rewrite, we need to match $L$ as a substructure of a redex $C$. The structure $K$, thought of as a substructure of $L$, is exactly the part of $L$ which is to remain invariant as we apply the rule to $C$. Finally, parts of $R$ which are not in $K$ should be added to produce the final result of the rewrite.

> Thus, an application of a rewrite rule consists of three steps. First we must match $L$ as a substructure of the redex C; secondly, we delete all of parts of the redex matched by $L$ which are not included in $K$. Thirdly, we add all of $R$ which is not contained in $K$, thereby producing a new structure $D$.  The deletion and addition of structure is handled, respectively, by finding a pushout complement and constructing a pushout.
