## Idea

In general, the term 'cross product' is used for any operation denoted by the symbol '$\times$', such as [[cartesian product]], [[direct product]], [[Tychonoff product]], or (subsuming all of these) [[product|product in a category]].

However, there is another completely different context, used in the elementary analysis of [[vector spaces]], and that is what we discuss here.  Originally isolated from the multiplication operation in [[quaternions]] a a binary operation on $\mathbb{R}^3$, the cross product now has generalisations to other arities, other dimensions, and other ground fields.


## Traditional definition

The **cross product** on the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^3$ is the [[bilinear function]]

$$
  (-) \times (-)\colon \mathbb{R}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}^3
$$

given by

$$ (a,b,c) \times (d,e,f) = (b e - c f, c d - a f, a e - b d) .$$

This operation is invariant under [[orthogonal group|orthogonal transformations]] and there is nothing special here about the [[real numbers]], so given any $3$-dimensional [[orientation|oriented]] [[inner product space]] $V$ over any [[field]], we have a bilinear cross product

$$
  (-) \times (-)\colon V \times V \to V
$$

given, upon choosing any oriented basis for $V$, by the formula above.


## Binary generalisation

We have already, trivially, generalized the cross product to other ground fields.  One way to generalise it to other dimensions is to identify characteristic features as a bilinear operation and see what operations in other dimensions have these.

In this vein, a binary **cross product** on any [[inner product space]] $V$ is a [[bilinear function]]

$$
  (-) \times (-)\colon V \times V \to V
$$

such that for all $x, y\in V$ we have

1. Orthgonality: $x \times y$ is orthogonal to both $x$ and $y$; that is, $x \cdot (x \times y) = (x \times y) \cdot y = 0$.

2. Area: $\|x \times y\| = \|x\| \|y\|$ if $x, y$ are orthogonal.

3. Nontriviality: $x \times y \neq 0$ if $x,y$ are [[linearly independent sunset|linearly independent]].

From (1,2) and linearity, we can prove a more general formula for ${\|x \times y\|}$:

* $2'$. Magnitude: ${\|x \times y\|}^2 = {\|x\|}^2 {\|y\|}^2 - (x \cdot y)^2$,

or equivalently

$$ \|x \times y\| = {\|x\|} {\|y\|} {|\sin\angle(x,y)|} .$$

We then have over the [[real numbers]]:

* In [[dimension]] $0$ or $1$, there is one binary cross product: $x \times y \coloneqq 0$.
* In dimension $3$, there are two binary cross products, one for each orientation, matching the classical cross product.
* In dimension $7$, there are uncountably many binary cross products.  Even fixing a basis and requiring compatibility with this, there are still hundreds of cross products.
* In any other finite dimension, there are no binary cross products at all.

These cross products exist over any base field, but as far as I know there may be additional cross products over some.  Of course, the claim that there are uncountably many cross products in $7$ dimensions should be generalised and made more precise; the space of these inner products is some [[algebraic variety]].

Binary cross products are closely related to [[normed division algebras]] (NDAs).  Given a normed division algebra $A$, the imaginary hyperplane $Im(A)$ inherits an inner product from $A$ and gains a cross product as
$$ x \times y \coloneqq Im(x y) = \frac{1}{2}[x,y] = x y + x \cdot y .$$
Conversely, given an inner product space $V$, the orthogonal direct sum $K \oplus V$ becomes a NDA as
$$ (a,x) (b,y) = (a b - x \cdot y, a y + b x + x \times y) ,$$
where $K$ is the ground field.

By [[Hurwitz's theorem]], the only finite-dimensional NDAs over $\mathbb{R}$ are $\mathbb{R}$ itself (the [[real numbers]]), $\mathbb{C}$ (the [[complex numbers]]), $\mathbb{H}$ (the [[quaternions]]), and $\mathbb{O}$ (the [[octonions]]).  Thus the limited possibilities for binary cross products are determined by the limited possibilities for NDA structures.


## $(n-1)$-ary cross products

Given an [[orientation|oriented]] [[inner product space]] $V$ of finite [[dimension]] $n$, we can define the signed [[volume]] of an $n$-[[tuple]] of vectors.  (See also [[volume form]].)  This allows us to characterise a __cross product__ of $n - 1$ vectors as a multilinear operation
$$ &#x2a09;\colon V^{n - 1} \to V $$
such that
$$ &#x2a09;(v_1,\ldots,v_{n-1}) \cdot v_n = vol(v_1,\ldots,v_n) $$
always.  There is exactly one such cross product on any such $V$.

In $3$ dimensions, this also recovers the classical cross product.


## Common generalisations

In general, let a __cross product__ on any [[inner product space]] $V$ be a multilinear function
$$ &#x2a09;\colon V^k \to V $$
for some [[natural number]] $k$ (called the [[arity]]) such that:

1. Orthgonality: $&#x2a09;(v_1,\ldots,v_k)$ is orthogonal to each $v_i$.

2. Area: $\|&#x2a09;(v_1,\ldots,v_k)\| = \prod_i \|v_i\|$ if the $v_i$ are mutually orthogonal.

3. Nontriviality: $&#x2a09;(v_1,\ldots,v_k) \neq 0$ if the $v_i$ are [[linearly independent sunset|linearly independent]].

We can again extend (2) ti get the magnitude of the cross product of any $k$ vectors; its square is the [[determinant]] of the matrix whose $(i,j)$th entry is $v_i \cdot v_j$.

Then for an inner product space $V$ over $\mathbb{R}$ of finite dimension $n$, we have:

* If $k = 0$, then there is no cross product.
* If $k = 1$, then there is one cross product in dimension $0$, two cross products in dimension $2$ (one for each orientation), and no others.
* If $k = 2$, then the possibilities are as listed above for binary cross products.
* If $k = 3$, then there is one cross product (always $0$) for $n \leq 2$, two cross products (one for each orientation) when $n = 4$, some cross products when $n = 8$ that I don't understand (but which are presumably related to the [[octonions]]), and no others.
* If $3 \lt k \lt n - 1$, then there are no cross products.
* If $k = n - 1$, then there are two cross products, one for each orientation, as described above.
* If $k = n$, then there are no cross products.
* If $k \gt n$, then there is one cross product, whose value is always $0$.


## Cross product and curl

If $M$ is a [[Riemannian manifold]], then the [[tangent space]] at each point is an [[inner product space]], so it may be possible to smoothly assign a $k$-ary cross product to these spaces.  If this is done, then we can take the [[curl]] of a $(k-1)$-[[multivector|vector field]] as follows:

*  Use the metric to turn the $(k-1)$-vector field into a $(k-1)$-[[differential form|form]].
*  Take the [[exterior differential]] to get a $k$-form.
*  Use the metric again to get a $k$-vector field.
*  Apply the cross product to get a [[vector field]].

This vector field is the __curl__ of the original $(k-1)$-vector field.

When $k = 2$ and $n = 3$, there is one smooth choice of cross product for each [[orientation]] of $M$, and we recover the classical notion of curl.
