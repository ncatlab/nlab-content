According to Johnstone in _[[Stone Spaces]]_, a [[functor]] $F\colon C \to D$ is __finitary__ if it preserves all [[filtered colimits]].  According to AHS in _The [[Joy of Cats]]_, $F$ is __finitary__ if it maps every [[directed colimit]] in $C$ to a jointly [[epimorphism|epic]] diagram (but not necessarily a universal one) in $D$.  At least for [[monads]] on [[Set]], these definitions are equivalent, and we have that a monad (which always defines an [[algebraic category]]) defines a [[finitary algebraic category]] if and only if it is a finitary functor.
