## Idea

**Morse theory** is the method of studying the topology of a [[smooth manifold]] $M$ by the study of [[Morse functions]] $M\to\mathbb{R}$ and their associated gradient flows. 

Classical Morse theory centered around simple statements like Morse inequalities, concerning just the [[Betti number]]s. 

Novikov--Morse theory is a variant using [[multivalued functions]].

There are some infinite-dimensional generalizations like Floer instanton homology for 3-dimensional manifolds and also the Hamiltonian variant of [[Floer homology]] (and cohomology) for (finite dimensional) [[symplectic manifolds]]. Especially well studied is the case of the [[cotangent bundle]] of a differentiable manifold with its standard symplectic structure; this is sometimes called Floer--Oh homology. Floer homology has been partly motivated by Arnold's conjecture on periodic trajectories in [[classical mechanics]]. The symplectic variant of Floer cohomology is related to [[quantum cohomology]]. 

Founders of Morse theory were [[Marston Morse]], [[Raoul Bott]] and [[Albert Schwarz]].

## Definitions

A on a smooth manifold $M$, [[smooth]] function $\varphi: M \to \mathbb{R} $ is said to be *Morse* (or *a Morse function*) if

* the zero set of $ d \varphi $ consists of isolated points, and
* the [[Hessian]] of $\varphi$ at these points is nondegenerate.

The Morse functions on $M$ are dense in most reasonable topologies you could put on $C^{\infty}(M)$.
A further condition which is useful in case $M$ is not compact is 

* if the (closed) preimage of $ -\infty , \lambda ] $ under $\varphi$ is compact for all $\lambda$, then $\varphi$ is said to be *coercive*, whether or not it is Morse.

Together with a (smooth) Riemann structure $g =\langle \cdot,\bullet\rangle$, any real function $\varphi$ on $M$ defines a [[flow]] on $M$ by the equation
$$ - \langle \dot x, Y_x \rangle = Y_x \varphi = d\varphi(Y_x).$$
The Morse functions are notable in that the flows they define have isolated fixed-points with trivially linearizable dynamics, and <nowiki>[fixme: less vague?]</nowiki> no other stable cyles.

When $\varphi$ is Morse and coercive, the unstable manifolds of the fixpoints can be arranged into a [[CW complex]] $C_{unstable} (\varphi,g)$, canonically homeomorphic to $M$.  When $M$ is compact, $\varphi$ and $-\varphi$ are automatically both coercive, and $-\varphi$ induces a [[Poincare duality|dual]] CW complexe $ C_{stable} (\varphi,g) $.  Concretely, <nowiki>[details]</nowiki>.
