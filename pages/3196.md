**Morse theory** is the method of studying the topology of a [[smooth manifold]] $M$ by the study of [[Morse functions]] $M\to\mathbb{R}$ and their associated gradient flows. 

Classical Morse theory centered around simple statements like Morse inequalities, concerning just the [[Betti number]]s. 

Novikov--Morse theory is a variant using [[multivalued functions]].

There are some infinite-dimensional generalizations like Floer instanton homology for 3-dimensional manifolds and also the Hamiltonian variant of [[Floer homology]] (and cohomology) for (finite dimensional) [[symplectic manifolds]]. Especially well studied is the case of the [[cotangent bundle]] of a differentiable manifold with its standard symplectic structure; this is sometimes called Floer--Oh homology. Floer homology has been partly motivated by Arnold's conjecture on periodic trajectories in [[classical mechanics]]. The symplectic variant of Floer cohomology is related to [[quantum cohomology]].
