## Idea

A *pushout complement* is a "completion of a pair of [[arrows]] to a [[pushout]]".  Intuitively, it is a way to "remove part of an [[object]] of a [[category]]" while retaining information about how that part is "connected" to other parts.

## Definition

Given [[morphisms]] $m:C\to A$ and $g:A\to D$ in a [[category]], a **pushout complement** is a pair of arrows $f:C\to B$ and $n:B\to D$ such that the square
$$ \array{ C & \to & A \\ \downarrow & & \downarrow \\ B & \to & D }$$
[[commutative square|commutes]] and is a [[pushout]].

In general, even in good categories, pushout complements may not exist.  However, if they do exist, then as long as the category is [[adhesive category|adhesive]] (such as a [[topos]]), they are unique up to unique isomorphism.  In the language of [[homotopy type theory]], the [[type]] of pushout complements is an [[h-proposition]].

## Examples

* In the category [[Set]], if $m$ and $g$ are [[injections]] then a pushout complement always exists: take $B = D \setminus (A\setminus C)$.

* In a [[coherent category]], if $C=\emptyset$ and $g$ is a [[monomorphism]], then a pushout complement is the same as an ordinary [[complement]] for the [[subobject]] $A\to D$.

* In a category of [[graphs]], pushout complements play an important role in [[double pushout graph rewriting]].
