## Idea

In [[gauge theory]] two configurations $\phi_1, \phi_2$ of [[gauge fields]] may be different and still be [[equivalence|equivalent]]: there may be a _[[gauge transformation]]_ $\lambda \colon \phi_1 \to \phi_2$ between them.

In _[[higher gauge theory]]_ also gauge transformations themseves may be different but still equivalent: if therer is a **gauge-of-gauge transformation** $\rho \colon \lambda_1 \to \lambda_2$ between them.

These higher order gauge transformations are maybe best known in the [[physics]] literature in terms of their [[infinity-Lie theory|infinitesimal approximation]], the [[BRST complex]]: here the gauge transformations correspond to _ghost fields_ and the _gauge-of-gauge transformations_ to _ghost-of-ghost fields_.

## Examples

A basic example of a gauge field that has higher order gauge transformations is the [[B-field]]. But also [[magnetic current]], if described properly, exhibits higher gauge transformations, see at _[[Dirac charge quantization]]_.

For more see at _[[geometry of physics]]_.
