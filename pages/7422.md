#Volodin model for K-theory

This is the simplicial set /  complex constructed by Volodin, using a construction similar to that of the [[Vietoris complex]].  It is the [[Volodin space]] of the family of subgroups of the stable general linear group described as follows:

We let $T_n^\sigma(R)$ be the subgroup of $G\ell_n(R)$ formed by the $\sigma$-triangular matrices, (discussed at [[higher generation by subgroups]]), and then look at all such subgroups for all $n$, considering the stable general linear group $G\ell(R)$ as the colimit of the nested sequence of all the $G\ell_n(R)$, take $G = G\ell(R)$. Considering the family,  $\mathcal{H}$, of all the $T_n^\sigma(R)$, form the corresponding [[Volodin space]].
