## Idea

The _tangent bundle_ $T X \to X$ of a (sufficiently [[differentiation|differentiable]]) [[space]] $X$ is a [[bundle]] over $X$ whose [[fiber]] over a [[point]] $x \in X$ is the [[tangent space]] at that point, namely the collection of [[infinitesimal space|infinitesimal]] curves in $X$ emanating at $x$: "[[tangent vectors]]".

For nice enough [[spaces]] such as [[differentiable manifolds]] or more generally [[microlinear spaces]], the tangent bundle of $X$ is a [[vector bundle]] over $X$.

For example the graphics on the right shows the [[2-sphere]] with one of its [[tangent spaces]]. The tangent bundle of the sphere is the union of all these [[tangent spaces]], regarded as a [[topological space|topological]] [[bundle]] of [[vector space]] (a [[vector bundle]]) over the 2-sphere.

With a notion of tangent bundle comes the following terminology

* A _tangent vector_ on $X$ at $x \in X$ is an element of $T_x X$.

* The _tangent space_ of $X$ at a point $x$ is the [[fiber]] $T_x(X)$ of $T_*(X)$ over $x$;.

* A _tangent vector field_ on $X$ is a [[section]] of $T X$.

The precise definition of tangent bundle depends on the nature of the ambient category of [[space]]s. Below we give first the traditional definitions in ordinary [[differential geometry]]. Then we discuss the construction in more general context of [[smooth toposes]] in [[synthetic differential geometry]] and other categories of [[generalized smooth spaces]].

## Definitions in ordinary differential geometry

Here we define the notion of tangent bundle in the [[category]] [[Diff]] of [[smooth manifold]]s

There are three standard definitions of tangent vector known as

* [algebraic](#AlgebraicDefinition) (via derivations of algebras of smooth functions),

* [geometric](#GeometricDefinition) (via equivalence class of germs of curves)

* [physical](#DefinitionByGluing) (via components in local coordinate system with prescribed behaviour under change of coordinates).


### Algebraic definition
 {#AlgebraicDefinition}

Algebraically, we may define a __tangent vector__ $v$ at $a$ on $X$ as a [[scalar]]-valued [[derivation]] on the space of [[germs]] of  [[differentiable functions]] defined on $X$ near $a$, augmented by evaluation at $a$.  That is, given [[partial functions]] $f$ and $g$, each defined on some [[neighbourhood]] of $a$, we have:

1.  $v[f] = v[g]$ if $f = g$ on some (perhaps smaller) neighbourhood of $a$,
2.  $v[f + g] = v[f] + v[g]$,
3.  $v[c f] = c\, v[f]$ for $c$ a scalar,
4.  $v[f g] = f(a)\, v[g] + v[f]\, g(a)$;

In light of (4), (3) is equivalent to:

*  $v[k] = 0$ for $k$ a [[constant function]] (or indeed, for any function constant on any neighbourhood of $a$).

Globally, we may define a __tangent vector field__ $v$ as an ordinary (unaugmented) derivation on the space of differentiable functions defined on all of $X$.  (This works for differentiable manifolds and smooth manifolds, but not for [[analytic manifold]]s and [[algebraic manifold]]s; we need to be able to change functions locally.)  That is, given [[functions]] $f$ and $g$, we have:

1.  $v[f] = v[g]$ if $f = g$ (so really, the only reason to list this is to keep the numbering the same),
2.  $v[f + g] = v[f] + v[g]$,
3.  $v[c f] = c\, v[f]$ for $c$ a scalar,
4.  $v[f g] = f\, v[g] + v[f]\, g$;

In light of (4), (3) is again equivalent to:

*  $v[k] = 0$ for $k$ a [[constant function]].


Given a differentiable [[curve]] $c: \mathbf{R} \to X$, the __derivative__ $\dot{c}$ of $c$ is a curve in the tangent bundle; given an argument $t$ and a function $f$ defined near $c(t)$, the action is given by
$$ \dot{c}[f](t) = (f \circ c)'(t) ,$$
where $'$ indicates the usual derivative on the real line, so that $\dot{c}(t)$ is a tangent vector at $c(t)$.  (We really only need $c$ to be defined on a neighbourhood of $t$, of course.)

###### Definition
**(tangency relation on smooth curves)**


Let $X$ be a [[differentiable manifold]] of [[dimension]] $n$ and let $x \in X$ be a point. On the set of [[smooth functions]] of the form

$$
  \gamma \;\colon\; \mathbb{R}^1 \longrightarrow X
$$

such that

$$
  \gamma(0) = x
$$

define the [[relations]]

$$
  (\gamma_1 \sim \gamma_2)
   \coloneqq
   \underset{
      {  { \mathbb{R}^n  \underoverset{}{\phi \, \text{chart}}{\to} U_i \subset X } } \atop { U_i \supset \{x\} }
      }{
        \exists
      }
   \left(
      \frac{d}{d t}(\phi^{-1}\circ \gamma_1)(0)
      =
      \frac{d}{d t}(\phi^{-1}\circ \gamma_2)(0)
   \right)
$$

and

$$
  (\gamma_1 \sim' \gamma_2)
   \coloneqq
   \underset{
      {  { \mathbb{R}^n  \underoverset{}{\phi \, \text{chart}}{\to} U_i \subset X } } \atop { U_i \supset \{x\} }
      }{
        \forall
      }
   \left(
      \frac{d}{d t}(\phi^{-1}\circ \gamma_1)(0)
      =
      \frac{d}{d t}(\phi^{-1}\circ \gamma_2)(0)
   \right)
$$

saying that two such functions are related precisely if either there exists a chart around $x$ such that (or else for all charts around $x$ it is true that) the first [[derivative]] of the two functions regarded via the given chart as functions $\mathbb{R}^1 \to \mathbb{R}^n$, coincide at $t = 0$ (with $t$ denoting the canonical [[coordinate]] function on $\mathbb{R}$).

=--

+-- {: .num_lemma #TangencyIsEquivalenceRelation}
###### Lemma
**(tangency is equivalence relation)**

The two relations in def. \ref{TangencyRelationOnSmoothCurves} are [[equivalence relations]] and they coincide.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First to see that they conincide, we need to show that if the derivatives in question coincide in one chart $\mathbb{R}^n \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi}{\to} U_i \subset X$, that then they coincide also in any other chart $\mathbb{R}^n \underoverset{\simeq}{\psi}{\to} U_j \subset X$.

Write

$$
  U_{i j} \coloneqq U_i \cap U_j
$$

for the intersection of the two charts.

First of all, since the derivative may be computed in any [[open neighbourhood]] around $t = 0$, and since the differentiable functions $\gamma_i$ are in particular [[continuous functions]], we may restrict to the open neighbourhood

$$
  V \coloneqq \gamma_1^{-1}( U_{i j} ) \cap \gamma_2^{-1}(U_{i j})
  \;\subset\; \mathbb{R}
$$

of $0 \in \mathbb{R}$ and consider the derivatives of the functions

$$
  \gamma_i^{\phi}
  \;\coloneqq\;
  (\phi\vert_{U_{i j}} \circ \gamma_i\vert_{V}) \;\colon\; V \longrightarrow \phi^{-1}(U_{i j}) \subset \mathbb{R}^n
$$

and

$$
  \gamma_i^{\psi}
  \;\coloneqq\;
  (\psi\vert_{U_{i j}} \circ \gamma_i \vert _{V}) \;\colon\; V \longrightarrow \psi^{-1}(U_{i j}) \subset \mathbb{R}^n
  \,.
$$

But then by definition of the differentiable [[atlas]], there is the differentiable function

$$
  \alpha
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \phi^{-1}(U_{i j})
    \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi}{\longrightarrow}
  U_{i j}
    \underoverset{\simeq}{\psi^{-1}}{\longrightarrow}
  \psi^{-1}(U_i j)
$$

such that


$$
  \gamma_i^\psi = \alpha \circ \gamma_i^\phi
$$

for $i \in \{1,2\}$. The [[chain rule]] now relates the derivatives of these functions as

$$
  \frac{d}{d t} \gamma_i^\psi
    \;=\;
  (D \alpha) \circ \left(\frac{d}{d t} \gamma_i^\phi\right)
  \,.
$$

Since $\alpha$ is a [[diffeomorphism]] and since derivatives of diffeomorphisms are linear isomorphisms, this says that the derivative of $\gamma_i^\phi$ is related to that of $\gamma_i^\psi$ by a linear isomorphism, and hence

$$
  \left(
   \frac{d}{d t}(\gamma_1)^\phi = \frac{d}{d t}(\gamma_2^\phi)
  \right)
    \;\Leftrightarrow\;
  \left(
   \frac{d}{d t}(\gamma_1)^\psi = \frac{d}{d t}(\gamma_2^\psi)
  \right)
  \,.
$$

Finally, that either relation is an equivalence relation is immediate.

###### Definition
**([[tangent vector]])

Let $X$ be a [[differentiable manifold]] and $x \in X$ a point. Then a _tangent vector_ on $X$ at $x$ is an [[equivalence class]] of the the tangency equivalence relation (def. \ref{TangencyRelationOnSmoothCurves}, lemma \ref{TangencyIsEquivalenceRelation}).

The set of all tangent vectors at $x \in X$ is denoted $T_x X$.

=--

+-- {: .num_lemma #LinearTangentSpace}
###### Lemma
**([[real vector space]] structure on [[tangent vectors]])**

For $X$ a [[differentiable manifold]] of [[dimension]] $n$ and $x \in X$ any point,  let $\mathbb{R}^n \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi}{\to} U \subset X$ be a [[chart]] with $x \in U \subset X$.

Then there is induced a [[bijection]] of sets

$$
  \mathbb{R}^n \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}  T_x X
$$

from the $n$-dimensional [[Cartesian space]] to the set of tangent vectors at $x$ (def. \ref{TangentVector}) given by sending $\vec v \in \mathbb{R}^n$ to the equivalence class of the following smooth curve:

$$
  \array{
    \gamma^\phi_{(-)}
    &
    \mathbb{R}^1
      &\overset{  }{\longrightarrow}&
   \mathbb{R}^n
      &\underoverset{\simeq}{\phi}{\longrightarrow}&
    U_i
    \subset X
    \\
    &
    t
      &\overset{\phantom{AAA}}{\mapsto}&
    t \vec v 
      &\overset{\phantom{AAA}}{\mapsto}&
    \phi(\phi^{-1}(x) + t \vec v)
  }
  \,.
$$

For $\mathbb{R}^n \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi'}{\longrightarrow} U' \subset X$
another chart with $x \in U' \subset X$, then the linear isomorphism relating these two identifications is
the [[differential]]

$$
  D \left((\phi')^{-1} \circ \phi  \right)(x)
  \in GL(n,\mathbb{R})
$$

of the [[gluing function]] of the two charts at the point $x$:

$$
  \array{
    \mathbb{R}^n
    && \overset{D (\phi')^{-1} \circ \phi}(x){\longrightarrow} &&
    \mathbb{R}^n
    \\
    & {}_{\mathlap{\simeq}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    \\
    66 T_x X
  }
  \,.
$$

This is also called the _[[transition function]]_ between the two local identifications of the tangent space.

If $\left\{ \mathbb{R}^n \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi_i}{\to} U_i \subset X \right\}_{i \in I}$
is an [[atlas]] of the [[differentiable manifold]] $X$, then the transition functions

$$
  \left\{
    g_{i j}
    \coloneqq
    D( \phi_j^{-1} \circ \phi_i )
    \colon
    U_i \cap U_j
      \longrightarrow
    GL(n,\mathbb{R})
  \right\}_{i,j \in I}
$$

defined this way satisfy the following [[Cech cohomoogy|Cech cocycle]] conditions for all $i,j \in I$, $x \in U_i \cap U_j$

1. $g_{i i}(x) = id_{\mathbb{R^n}$;

1. $g_{j k}\circ g_{i j}(x) = g_{i k}(x)$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The bijectivity of the map is immediate from the fact that the first derivative of $\phi^{-1}\circ \gamma^\phi_{\vec v}$
at $\phi^{-1}(x)$ is $\vec v$. 

The formula for the transition function now follows with the [[chain rule]]:

$$  
  \frac{d}{d t} \left(  (\phi')^{-1}\phi(\phi^{-1}(x) + t \vec v ) \right)
  =
  D\left( (\phi')^{-1} \circ \phi \right)(\vec v)
  \,.
$$

Similarly the Cech cocycle condition follows by the [[chain rule]]:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    g_{j k} \circ g_{i j}(x)
     & =
    D( \phi_k^{-1} \circ \phi_j )
    \circ
    D( \phi_j^{-1} \circ \phi_i )(x)
    \\
    & =
    D( \phi_k^{-1} \circ \phi_j \circ \phi_j^{-1} \circ \phi_i )(x)
    \\
    & =
    D( \phi_k^{-1} \circ \phi_i )(x)
    \\
    &=
    g_{i k}(x)
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark
**(notation for tangent vectors in a chart)**

Under the bijection of lemma \ref{LinearTangentSpace} one often denotes the tangent vector  corresponding to the the $i$-th canonical [[linear basis|basis]] vector of $\mathbb{R}^n$ by

$$
  \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}
  \phantom{AA} \text{or just } \phantom{AA}
  \partial_i
$$

because under the identification of tangent vectors with [[derivations]] on the algebra of [[differentiable functions]] on $X$ as [above](#AlgebraicDefinition) then it acts as the operation of taking the $i$th [[partial derivative]]. The general tangent vector corresponding to $v \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is then denoted by

$$
  \underoverset{i = 1}{n}{\sum}
  v^i
  \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}
  \phantom{AA} \text{or just } \phantom{AA}
  \underoverset{i = 1}{n}{\sum} v^i \partial_i
  \,.
$$


Notice that this identification depends on the choice of [[chart]], which is left implicit in this notation.

Sometimes, notably in texts on [[thermodynamics]], one augments this notation to indicate the chart being used by listing the remaining coordinate functions as subscripts. For instance if two functions $f,g$ on a 2-dimensional manifold are used as coordinate functions for a local chart (i.e. so that $x^1 = f$ and $x^2 = g$ ), then one write

$$
  (\partial/\partial f)_g
  \phantom{AA}
  (\partial/\partial g)_f
$$

for the tangent vectors $\frac{\partial}{\partial x^1}$ and $\frac{\partial}{\partial x^2}$, respectively.

###### Definition
**([[tangent space]])**

For $X$ a [[differentiable manifold]] and $x \in X$ a point, then the _[[tangent space]]_ of $X$ at $x$ is the set $T_x X$ of [[tangent vectors]] at $x$ (def. \ref{TangentVector}) regarded as a [[real vector space]] via lemma \ref{LinearTangentSpace}.

=--

+-- {: .num_example #EuclideanSpaceTangentBundle}
###### Example
**([[tangent bundle]] of [[Euclidean space]])

If $X = \mathbb{R}^n$ is itself a [[Euclidean space]], then 
for any two points $x,y \in X$ the [[tangent spaces]] $T_x X$ and $T_y X$ (def. \ref{TangentSpace})
are canonically identified with each other: 

Using the [[vector space]] (or just [[affine space]]) structure of $X = \mathbb{R}^n$ we may send every
smooth function $\gamma \colon \mathbb{R} \to X$ to the smooth function

$$
  \gamma' \colon t \mapsto \gamma(t) + (x-y)
  \,.
$$

This gives a linear bijection

$$
  \phi_{x,y} \colon T_x X \simeq T_y X
$$

and these linear bijections are compatible, in that for $x,y,z \in \mathbb{R}^n$ any three points,
then

$$
  \phi_{y,z} \circ \phi_{x,y} = \phi_{x,z} \;\colon\; T_x X \longrightarrow T_y Y
  \,.
$$

Moreover, by lemma \ref{LinearTangentSpace}, each tangent space is identified with $\mathbb{R}^n$ itself, 
and this identification in turn is compatible with all the above identifications:

$$
  \array{
    && \mathbb{R}^n
    \\
    & \swarrow && \searrow
    \\
    T_x X && \underoverset{\phi_{x,y}}{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} && T_y Y
  }
  \,.
$$

Therefore it makes sense to canonically identify all the tangent spaces of Euclidean space with that Euclidean space
itself. As a result, the collection of all the tangent spaces of Euclidean space is naturally identified 
with the [[Cartesian product]]

$$
  T \mathbb{R}^n = \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n
$$

equipped with the [[projection]] on the first factor

$$
  \array{
    T \mathbb{R}^n = \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\pi = pr_1}}
    \\
    \mathbb{R}^n
  }
  \,,
$$

because then the [[pre-image]] of a [[singleton]] $\{x\} \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ under this projection are 
canonically identified with the above tangent spaces:

$$
  \pi^{-1}(\{x\}) \simeq T_x \mathbb{R}^n
  \,.
$$

This way, if we equip $T \mathbb{R}^n = \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n$ with the [[product space topology]], 
then  $T \mathbb{R}^n \overset{\pi}{\longrightarrow} \mathbb{R}^n$ becomes a [[trivial]] [[topological vector bundle]].
This is called the _[[tangent bundle]]_ of the [[Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ regarded as a [[differentiable manifold]].


=--

We may now globalize the tangent bundle of Euclidean space to tangent bundles of general differentiable manifolds:

+-- {: .num_defn #TangentBundle}
###### Definition
**([[tangent bundle]])**

Let $X$ be a [[differentiable manifold]] with [[atlas]] $\left\{ \mathbb{R}^n \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi_i}{\to} U_i \subset X\right\}_{i \in I}$.

Equip the set of all tangent vectors (def. \ref{TangentVector})

$$
  T X
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \underset{x \in X}{\sqcup} T_x X
$$

with a [[topological space|topology]] $\tau_{T X}$ by declaring a [[subset]] $U \subset T X$ to be an [[open subset]] precisely if for all [[charts]] $\mathbb{R}^n \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi_i}{\to} U_i \subset X$ then its [[preimage]] under

      &\overset{\phantom{AAA}}{\mapsto}&
    \frac{d}{d t} \phi( \phi^{-1}(x) + t \vec v  )
  }
$$

is open in the [[Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ with its [[metric topology]].

Equipped with the [[function]]

$$
  \array{
     T X &\overset{\phantom{AA}p_x \phantom{AA}}{\longrightarrow}& X
     \\
     (x,v) &\overset{\phantom{AAAA}}{\mapsto}& x
  }
$$

this is called the _tangent bundle_ of $X$.

Equivalently this means that the tangent bundle $T X$ is the [[topological vector bundle]] which 
is glued (via [this example](topological+vector+bundle#TopologicalVectorBundleFromCechCocycle)) from the 
[[transition functions]] $g_{i j} \coloneqq D(\phi_j^{-1} \circ \phi_i)$ from lemma \ref{LinearTangentSpace}:

$$
  T X
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \left(
    \underset{i \in I}{\sqcup}
    U_i \times \mathbb{R}^n
  \right)/( \left\{  D( \phi_j^{-1} \circ \phi_i ) \right\}_{i, j \in I} )
  \,.
$$

(Notice that, by examples \ref{EuclideanSpaceTangentBundle}, each $U_i \times \mathbb{R}^n \simeq T U_i$ is the tangent bundle
of the chart $U_i \simeq \mathbb{R}^n$.)

The co-projection maps of this [[quotient topological space]] construction constitute an [[atlas]]

    \mathbb{R}^{2n}
      \underoverset{\simeq}{d \phi_i}{\to}

###### Lemma
**(tangent bundle is differentiable vector bundle)**

If $X$ is a $(p+1)$-times [[differentiable manifold]], then the total space 
of the tangent bundle def. \ref{TangentBundle} is a $p$-times [[differentiable manifold]] in that

1. $(T X, \tau_{T X})$ is a [[paracompact Hausdorff space]];

1. The [[gluing functions]] of the atlas $\left\{ \mathbb{R}^{2n} \underoverset{\simeq}{d \phi_i}{\to} T U_i \subset  T X \right\}_{i \in I}$ are $p$-times continuously differentiable.

Moreover, the projection $\pi \colon T X \to X$ is a $p$-times continuously [[differentiable function]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First to see that $T X$ is Hausdorff: 

Let $(x,\vec v), (x', ´\vec v') \in T X$ be two distinct points. We need to product 
disjoint openneighbourhoods of these points in $T X$. Since in
particular $x,x' \in X$ are distinct, and since $X$ is Hausdorff, there exist disjoint open neighbourhoods
$U_x \supset \{x\}$ and $U_{x'} \supset \{x'\}$. Their pre-images $\pi^{-1}(U_x)$ and $\pi^{-1}(U_{x'})$
are disjoint open neighbourhoods of $(x,\vec v)$ and $(x',\vect v')$, respectively.

Now to see that $T X$ is paracompact. 

Let $\{U_i \subset T X\}_{i \in I}$ be an open cover. We need to find a [[locally finite cover|locally finite]]
[[refinement]]. Notice that $\pi \colon T X \to X$ is an [[open map]] (by [this example](open+map#ProjectionsAreOpenContinuousFunctions))
so that $\{\pi(U_i) \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ is an open cover of $X$. 

Let now $\{\mathbb{R}^n \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi_j}{\to} V_j \subset X\}_{j \in J}$ be an [[atlas]] for $X$ and consider the 
open common refinement

$$
  \left\{ \pi(U_i) \cap V_j \subset X  \right\}_{i \in I, j \in J}
  \,.
$$

Since this is still an open cover of $X$ and since $X$ is paracompact, this has a locally finite refinement

$$
  \left\{ V'_{j'} \subset X\right\}_{j' \in J'}
$$

Since for each $j \in J$ the Euclidean product topological space $V_j \times \mathbb{R}^n \simeq \mathbb{R}^{2n}$ is paracompact,
the cover $\{ \pi^{-1}(V'_{j'}) \subset V'_{j'} \times \mathbb{R}^n \}_{(i,j') \in I \times J'}$ has a locally finite refinement
$\{W_{k_{j'}} \subset V'_{j'} \}_{k_{j'} \in K_{j'}}$.

We claim now that 

$$
  \{ W_{k_{j'}} \cap \pi^{-1}(V'_{j'}) \subset T X \}_{j' \in J',  k_{j'} \in K_{j'}}
$$ 

is a locally finite refinement of the original cover.
That this is an open cover refining the original one is clear. We need to see that it is locally finite.
So let $(x,\vec v) \in T X$. By local finiteness of $\{ V'_{j'}  \subset X\}_{j' \in J'}$ there is an open neighbourhood
$V_x \supset \{x\}$ which intersects only finitely many of the $V_{j'}$. For each such $j'$ the point $(x,\vec v)$ regarded in $V_{j'} \times \mathbb{R}^n$ has an open neighbourhood $U_{j'}$ that intersects only finitely many of the $W_{k_{j'}}$. Hence the 
intersection $\pi^{-1}(V_c) \cap \left( \underset{j'}{\cap}  U_{j'} \right)$ is a finite intersection of open subsets, hence still open,
and by construction it intersects still only a finite number of the $W_{k_{j'}}$.

This shows that $T X$ is paracompact.

Finally the statement about the differentiability of the glung functions and of the projections is immediate from the definitions

###### Proposition
**([[differentials]] of [[differentiable functions]] between [[differentiable manifolds]])**

descends at each point $x \in X$ to the tangency [[equivalence relation]] (def. \ref{TangencyRelationOnSmoothCurves}, lemma \ref{TangencyIsEquivalenceRelation}) to yield a function on sets of [[tangent vectors]] (def. \ref{TangentVector}), called the _[[differential]]_ $d f|_{x}$ of $f$ at $x$

$$
  d f|_{x}
    \;\colon\;

  T_{f(x)} Y

$$

Moreover:

1. ([[linear function|linear dependence]] on the tangent vector) these differentials are [[linear functions]] with respect to the vector space structure on the [[tangent spaces]] from lemma \ref{LinearTangentSpace}, def. \ref{TangentSpace};

1.

###### Remark

In the language of [[category theory]] the statement of prop. \ref{FunctionsBetweenDifferentiableManifoldsDifferentials} says that forming [[tangent bundles]] $T X$ of [[differentiable manifolds]] $X$ and [[differentials]] $d f$  of [[differentiable functions]] $f \colon X \to Y$ constitutes a [[functor]]

### Definition by gluing construction
 {#DefinitionByGluing}

If $M$ is a smooth $n$-manifold, then we know the tangent space at each point is isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$. We can exploit this fact to construct the tangent space by gluing many copies of $\mathbb{R}^n$ together. However, one drawback is that it is not immediately obvious that the result is independent of the atlas chosen.

Let $M$ be a smooth $n$-manifold defined by an atlas $(U_\alpha, \phi_\alpha)$. Then we may define its tangent bundle $T M$ by a gluing construction in $Top$, taking $T M$ to be the quotient of the disjoint sum

$$\sum_\alpha U_\alpha \times \mathbb{R}^n$$

obtained by dividing by the equivalence relation

$$(p \in U_\alpha, v) \sim (p \in U_\beta, g_{\alpha\beta}(p) v)$$

where $p \in U_\alpha \cap U_\beta$, and $g_{\alpha\beta}(p) \in GL(\mathbb{R}^n)$ is the result of differentiating the transition function $\phi_{\alpha\beta}$ at the point $\phi_\alpha(p)$. We thus obtain a covering $U_\alpha \times \mathbb{R}^n$ of $T M$, and these form coordinate charts of a smooth manifold structure on $T M$ in a more or less evident way, and the projection map is given by
$$
  p: (x, v) \mapsto x.
$$

In the above construction, the charts $\phi_\alpha$ were not used directly; Instead, the transition maps

$$g_{\alpha \beta}: U_\alpha \cap U_\beta \to GL(\mathbb{R}^n)$$

are what were needed to construct the tangent bundle. These maps satisfy Čech 1-cocycle relations

$$g_{\alpha \gamma} = g_{\beta\gamma} \circ g_{\alpha\beta}: U_{\alpha} \cap U_\beta \cap U_\gamma \to GL(\mathbb{R}^n)$$

$$\qquad g_{\alpha\alpha} = 1: U_{\alpha} \to GL(\mathbb{R}^n)$$

In general, given any collection of transition maps that satisfy these cocycle conditions, we can construct a [[vector bundle]] in the same manner (which may be different from the tangent bundle).

## Definition in synthetic differential geometry {#InSDG}

The above definitions in ordinary [[differential geometry]] suggest the slogan

+-- {: .standout}

Tangent vectors are infinitesimal curves in a space.

=--

One of the central motivations for [[synthetic differential geometry]] is the desire to provide a context in which this slogan becomes literally formally true.

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition
**(tangent bundle in smooth toposes)**

Let $(\mathcal{T},(R,+,\cdot))$ be a [[smooth topos]] and write  $D = \{\epsilon \in R| \epsilon^2 = 0\}$ for the standard [[infinitesimal space|infinitesimal interval]]. For $X \in \mathcal{T}$ any object (any [[space]] in $\mathcal{T}$), the **tangent bundle** of $X$ is the morphism

$$
  p : T X \to X
$$

with

* $T X \coloneq X^D$ the [[internal hom]] of $D$ into $X$;

* $p = ev_0$ the evaluation map at the origin of $D$

  $ev_0 : (U \stackrel{v}{\to} X^D) \mapsto
  (U \times {*} \stackrel{Id \times 0}{\to} U \times D
  \stackrel{\bar v}{\to} X)$,

  where $\bar v$ is the hom-[[adjunct]] of $v$.

=--

This definition captures elegantly and usefully the notion of tangent vectors as infinitesimal curves. But it is not guaranteed that the fibers of a synthetic tangent bundle $X^D$ are fiberwise linear, i.e. are fiberwise $R$-modules the way one expects. Objects $X$ for which this is true are [[microlinear space]]s in $\mathcal{T}$. See there for more details.

A [[smooth topos]] $\mathcal{T}$ is called a _well-adapted model_ for [[synthetic differential geometry]] if there is a [[full and faithful functor|full and faithful]] embedding [[Diff]] $\hookrightarrow \mathcal{T}$ of the cageory of [[manifold]]s into $\mathcal{T}$.

Typically, for well adapted models, under this embedding

* manifolds are [[microlinear space]]s

* the synthetic definition of tangent bundle $X^D$ for $X$ a manifold does coincide with the ordinary notion of $T X$.

Let $\mathbb{L} = (C^\infty Ring^{fin})^{op}$ be the category of [[generalized smooth algebra|smooth loci]]. For $M$ a [[manifold]], the exponential $M^D$ does exist in $\mathbb{L}$ and is isomorphic to the ordinary tangent bundle $T X$ of $X$. (For instance  [[Models for Smooth Infinitesimal Analysis|MSIA, chapter II, prop 1.12]].

There are well-adapted [[smooth topos]]es $\mathcal{Z}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ presented as [[category of sheaves|categories of sheaves]] on $\mathbb{L}$: the first for the [[Grothendieck topology]] where covers are _finite_ open covers, the second where covers are finite open covers and projections ([[Models for Smooth Infinitesimal Analysis|MSIA, chapter VI]]). Both topologies are [[subcanonical coverage|subcanonical]], hence the [[Yoneda embedding]] $Y : \mathbb{L} \to Sh(\mathbb{L})$ does preserve the above property.

Hence in these models for $X \in Diff$ a [[manifold]], $T X \in Diff$ its ordinary tangent bundle and $s : Diff \to Sh(\mathbb{L})$ the full and faithful embedding, we have isomorphisms

$$
  (s(X))^D  \simeq s(T X)
$$

which respect the bundle maps.

## As a supermanifold

The tangent bundle of a manifold $X$ may be interpreted as a [[supermanifold]] in which $X$ has degree $0$ and the tangent vectors have degree $1$.  See [[shifted tangent bundle]].

## Definition for other generalized smooth spaces

There are useful categories of [[generalized smooth space]]s which are neither categories of manifolds nor [[smooth topos]]es modeling [[synthetic differential geometry]]. But most of them admit useful notions of tangent bundles, too, sometimes more than one.

See [[Frölicher space]] and [[diffeological space]] for the definitions in their context.
