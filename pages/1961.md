## Idea

The _tangent bundle_ $T X \to X$ of a (sufficiently [[differentiation|differentiable]]) [[space]] $X$ is a [[bundle]] over $X$ whose [[fiber]] over a [[point]] $x \in X$ is the [[tangent space]] at that point, namely the collection of [[infinitesimal space|infinitesimal]] curves in $X$ emanating at $x$: "[[tangent vectors]]". 

For nice enough [[spaces]] such as [[differentiable manifolds]] or more generally [[microlinear spaces]], the tangent bundle of $X$ is a [[vector bundle]] over $X$.

For example the graphics on the right shows the [[2-sphere]] with one of its [[tangent spaces]]. The tangent bundle of the sphere is the union of all these [[tangent spaces]], regarded as a [[topological space|topological]] [[bundle]] of [[vector space]] (a [[vector bundle]]) over the 2-sphere.

With a notion of tangent bundle comes the following terminology

* A _tangent vector_ on $X$ at $x \in X$ is an element of $T_x X$.  

* The _tangent space_ of $X$ at a point $x$ is the [[fiber]] $T_x(X)$ of $T_*(X)$ over $x$;.  

* A _tangent vector field_ on $X$ is a [[section]] of $T X$.

The precise definition of tangent bundle depends on the nature of the ambient category of [[space]]s. Below we give first the traditional definitions in ordinary [[differential geometry]]. Then we discuss the construction in more general context of [[smooth toposes]] in [[synthetic differential geometry]] and other categories of [[generalized smooth spaces]].

## Definitions in ordinary differential geometry

Here we define the notion of tangent bundle in the [[category]] [[Diff]] of [[smooth manifold]]s

There are three standard definitions of tangent vector known as 

* [algebraic](#AlgebraicDefinition) (via derivations of algebras of smooth functions), 

* [geometric](#GeometricDefinition) (via equivalence class of germs of curves)

* [physical](#DefinitionByGluing) (via components in local coordinate system with prescribed behaviour under change of coordinates).


### Algebraic definition
 {#AlgebraicDefinition}

Algebraically, we may define a __tangent vector__ $v$ at $a$ on $X$ as a [[scalar]]-valued [[derivation]] on the space of [[germs]] of  [[differentiable functions]] defined on $X$ near $a$, augmented by evaluation at $a$.  That is, given [[partial functions]] $f$ and $g$, each defined on some [[neighbourhood]] of $a$, we have:

1.  $v[f] = v[g]$ if $f = g$ on some (perhaps smaller) neighbourhood of $a$,
2.  $v[f + g] = v[f] + v[g]$,
3.  $v[c f] = c\, v[f]$ for $c$ a scalar,
4.  $v[f g] = f(a)\, v[g] + v[f]\, g(a)$;

In light of (4), (3) is equivalent to:

*  $v[k] = 0$ for $k$ a [[constant function]] (or indeed, for any function constant on any neighbourhood of $a$).

Globally, we may define a __tangent vector field__ $v$ as an ordinary (unaugmented) derivation on the space of differentiable functions defined on all of $X$.  (This works for differentiable manifolds and smooth manifolds, but not for [[analytic manifold]]s and [[algebraic manifold]]s; we need to be able to change functions locally.)  That is, given [[functions]] $f$ and $g$, we have:

1.  $v[f] = v[g]$ if $f = g$ (so really, the only reason to list this is to keep the numbering the same),
2.  $v[f + g] = v[f] + v[g]$,
3.  $v[c f] = c\, v[f]$ for $c$ a scalar,
4.  $v[f g] = f\, v[g] + v[f]\, g$;

In light of (4), (3) is again equivalent to:

*  $v[k] = 0$ for $k$ a [[constant function]].


Given a differentiable [[curve]] $c: \mathbf{R} \to X$, the __derivative__ $\dot{c}$ of $c$ is a curve in the tangent bundle; given an argument $t$ and a function $f$ defined near $c(t)$, the action is given by
$$ \dot{c}[f](t) = (f \circ c)'(t) ,$$
where $'$ indicates the usual derivative on the real line, so that $\dot{c}(t)$ is a tangent vector at $c(t)$.  (We really only need $c$ to be defined on a neighbourhood of $t$, of course.)

###### Definition
**(tangency relation on smooth curves)**


Let $X$ be a [[differentiable manifold]] of [[dimension]] $n$ and let $x \in X$ be a point. On the set of [[smooth functions]] of the form

$$
  \gamma \;\colon\; \mathbb{R}^1 \longrightarrow X
$$

such that 

$$
  \gamma(0) = x
$$

define the [[relations]] 

$$
  (\gamma_1 \sim \gamma_2)
   \coloneqq
   \underset{ 
      {  { \mathbb{R}^n  \underoverset{}{\phi \, \text{chart}}{\to} U_i \subset X } } \atop { U_i \supset \{x\} }  
      }{
        \exists
      }
   \left(
      \frac{d}{d t}(\phi^{-1}\circ \gamma_1)(0)
      =
      \frac{d}{d t}(\phi^{-1}\circ \gamma_2)(0)
   \right)
$$

and

$$
  (\gamma_1 \sim' \gamma_2)
   \coloneqq
   \underset{ 
      {  { \mathbb{R}^n  \underoverset{}{\phi \, \text{chart}}{\to} U_i \subset X } } \atop { U_i \supset \{x\} }  
      }{
        \forall
      }
   \left(
      \frac{d}{d t}(\phi^{-1}\circ \gamma_1)(0)
      =
      \frac{d}{d t}(\phi^{-1}\circ \gamma_2)(0)
   \right)
$$

saying that two such functions are related precisely if either there exists a chart around $x$ such that (or else for all charts around $x$ it is true that) the first [[derivative]] of the two functions regarded via the given chart as functions $\mathbb{R}^1 \to \mathbb{R}^n$, coincide at $t = 0$ (with $t$ denoting the canonical [[coordinate]] function on $\mathbb{R}$).

=--

+-- {: .num_lemma #TangencyIsEquivalenceRelation}
###### Lemma
**(tangency is equivalence relation)**

The two relations in def. \ref{TangencyRelationOnSmoothCurves} are [[equivalence relations]] and they coincide.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First to see that they conincide, we need to show that if the derivatives in question coincide in one chart $\mathbb{R}^n \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi}{\to} U_i \subset X$, that then they coincide also in any other chart $\mathbb{R}^n \underoverset{\simeq}{\psi}{\to} U_j \subset X$.

Write

$$
  U_{i j} \coloneqq U_i \cap U_j
$$

for the intersection of the two charts.

First of all, since the derivative may be computed in any [[open neighbourhood]] around $t = 0$, and since the differentiable functions $\gamma_i$ are in particular [[continuous functions]], we may restrict to the open neighbourhood

$$
  V \coloneqq \gamma_1^{-1}( U_{i j} ) \cap \gamma_2^{-1}(U_{i j})
  \;\subset\; \mathbb{R}
$$

of $0 \in \mathbb{R}$ and consider the derivatives of the functions

$$
  \gamma_i^{\phi}
  \;\coloneqq\;
  (\phi\vert_{U_{i j}} \circ \gamma_i\vert_{V}) \;\colon\; V \longrightarrow \phi^{-1}(U_{i j}) \subset \mathbb{R}^n
$$

and

$$
  \gamma_i^{\psi}
  \;\coloneqq\;
  (\psi\vert_{U_{i j}} \circ \gamma_i \vert _{V}) \;\colon\; V \longrightarrow \psi^{-1}(U_{i j}) \subset \mathbb{R}^n
  \,.
$$

But then by definition of the differentiable [[atlas]], there is the differentiable function

$$
  \alpha
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \phi^{-1}(U_{i j})
    \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi}{\longrightarrow}
  U_{i j}
    \underoverset{\simeq}{\psi^{-1}}{\longrightarrow}
  \psi^{-1}(U_i j)
$$

such that


$$
  \gamma_i^\psi = \alpha \circ \gamma_i^\phi
$$

for $i \in \{1,2\}$. The [[chain rule]] now relates the derivatives of these functions as

$$
  \frac{d}{d t} \gamma_i^\psi
    \;=\;
  (D \alpha) \circ \left(\frac{d}{d t} \gamma_i^\phi\right)
  \,.
$$

Since $\alpha$ is a [[diffeomorphism]] and since derivatives of diffeomorphisms are linear isomorphisms, this says that the derivative of $\gamma_i^\phi$ is related to that of $\gamma_i^\psi$ by a linear isomorphism, and hence 

$$
  \left(
   \frac{d}{d t}(\gamma_1)^\phi = \frac{d}{d t}(\gamma_2^\phi)
  \right)
    \;\Leftrightarrow\;
  \left(
   \frac{d}{d t}(\gamma_1)^\psi = \frac{d}{d t}(\gamma_2^\psi)
  \right)
  \,.
$$

Finally, that either relation is an equivalence relation is immediate.

###### Definition
**([[tangent vector]])

Let $X$ be a [[differentiable manifold]] and $x \in X$ a point. Then a _tangent vector_ on $X$ at $x$ is an [[equivalence class]] of the the tangency equivalence relation (def. \ref{TangencyRelationOnSmoothCurves}, lemma \ref{TangencyIsEquivalenceRelation}).

The set of all tangent vectors at $x \in X$ is denoted $T_x X$.

=--

+-- {: .num_lemma #LinearTangentSpace}
###### Lemma
**([[real vector space]] structure on [[tangent vectors]])**

For $X$ a [[differentiable manifold]] of [[dimension]] $n$ and $x \in X$ any point,  let $\mathbb{R}^n \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi}{\to} U_i \subset X$ be a [[chart]] with $x \in U_i$.

Then there is induced a [[bijection]] of sets

$$
  \mathbb{R}^n \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}  T_x X 
$$

from the $n$-dimensional [[Cartesian space]] to the set of tangent vectors at $x$ (def. \ref{TangentVector}) given by sending $\vec v \in \mathbb{R}^n$ to the equivalence class of the following smooth curve:

$$
  \array{
    \mathbb{R}^1 
      &\overset{\gamma^\phi_{(-)}}{\longrightarrow}& 
   \mathbb{R}^n
      &\underoverset{\simeq}{\phi}{\longrightarrow}& 
    U_i
    \subset X
    \\
    t 
      &\overset{\phantom{AAA}}{\mapsto}& 
    t \vec v + \phi(x)
      &\overset{\phantom{AAA}}{\mapsto}&
    \phi^{-1}(t \vec v + \phi(x))
  }
  \,.
$$

Moreover, the structure of a [[real vector space]] inherited by $T_x X$ from $\mathbb{R}^n$ via $\phi$ this way is independent of the choice of $\phi$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The bijectivity of the map is immediate from the fact that the first derivative of $\gamma_{\vec v}^\phi$ is $\vec v$. The independency from the choice of chart follows as in the proof of lemma \ref{TangencyIsEquivalenceRelation}.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark
**(notation for tangent vectors in a chart)**

Under the bijection of lemma \ref{LinearTangentSpace} one often denotes the tangent vector  corresponding to the the $i$-th canonical [[linear basis|basis]] vector of $\mathbb{R}^n$ by

$$
  \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}
  \phantom{AA} \text{or just } \phantom{AA}
  \partial_i
$$ 

because under the identification of tangent vectors with [[derivations]] on the algebra of [[differentiable functions]] on $X$ as [above](#AlgebraicDefinition) then it acts as the operation of taking the $i$th [[partial derivative]]. The general tangent vector corresponding to $v \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is then denoted by

$$
  \underoverset{i = 1}{n}{\sum}
  v^i
  \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}
  \phantom{AA} \text{or just } \phantom{AA}
  \underoverset{i = 1}{n}{\sum} v^i \partial_i
  \,.
$$ 


Notice that this identification depends on the choice of [[chart]], which is left implicit in this notation.

Sometimes, notably in texts on [[thermodynamics]], one augments this notation to indicate the chart being used by listing the remaining coordinate functions as subscripts. For instance if two functions $f,g$ on a 2-dimensional manifold are used as coordinate functions for a local chart (i.e. so that $x^1 = f$ and $x^2 = g$ ), then one write

$$
  (\partial/\partial f)_g 
  \phantom{AA}
  (\partial/\partial g)_f
$$

for the tangent vectors $\frac{\partial}{\partial x^1}$ and $\frac{\partial}{\partial x^2}$, respectively.

For $X$ a [[differentiable manifold]] and $x \in X$ a point, then the _[[tangent space]]_ of $X$ at $x$ is the set $T_x X$ of [[tangent vectors]] at $x$ (def. \ref{TangentVector}) regarded as a [[real vector space]] via lemma \ref{LinearTangentSpace}.

this is called the _tangent bundle_ of $X$.

**(tangent bundle is differentiable vector bundle)**

The total space of the tangent bundle def. \ref{TangentBundle} is a [[differentiable manifold]] in that

1. $(T X, \tau_{T X})$ is a [[paracompact Hausdorff space]];

1. The [[gluing functions]] of the atlas $\left\{ \mathbb{R}^{2n} \underoverset{\simeq}{d \phi_i}{\to} T U_i \subset  T X \right\}_{i \in I}$ are differentiable.

Moreover, the function $p_X \colon T X \to X$ is [[continuous function|continuous]] and of the same degree of [[differentiable function|differentiability]] as the differentiable structure on $X$.

Finally, this makes the tangent bundle into a real [[vector bundle]] over $X$.

### Definition by gluing construction
 {#DefinitionByGluing}

If $M$ is a smooth $n$-manifold, then we know the tangent space at each point is isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$. We can exploit this fact to construct the tangent space by gluing many copies of $\mathbb{R}^n$ together. However, one drawback is that it is not immediately obvious that the result is independent of the atlas chosen.

Let $M$ be a smooth $n$-manifold defined by an atlas $(U_\alpha, \phi_\alpha)$. Then we may define its tangent bundle $T M$ by a gluing construction in $Top$, taking $T M$ to be the quotient of the disjoint sum

$$\sum_\alpha U_\alpha \times \mathbb{R}^n$$

obtained by dividing by the equivalence relation

$$(p \in U_\alpha, v) \sim (p \in U_\beta, g_{\alpha\beta}(p) v)$$

where $p \in U_\alpha \cap U_\beta$, and $g_{\alpha\beta}(p) \in GL(\mathbb{R}^n)$ is the result of differentiating the transition function $\phi_{\alpha\beta}$ at the point $\phi_\alpha(p)$. We thus obtain a covering $U_\alpha \times \mathbb{R}^n$ of $T M$, and these form coordinate charts of a smooth manifold structure on $T M$ in a more or less evident way, and the projection map is given by
$$
  p: (x, v) \mapsto x.
$$

In the above construction, the charts $\phi_\alpha$ were not used directly; Instead, the transition maps

$$g_{\alpha \beta}: U_\alpha \cap U_\beta \to GL(\mathbb{R}^n)$$

are what were needed to construct the tangent bundle. These maps satisfy Čech 1-cocycle relations

$$g_{\alpha \gamma} = g_{\beta\gamma} \circ g_{\alpha\beta}: U_{\alpha} \cap U_\beta \cap U_\gamma \to GL(\mathbb{R}^n)$$

$$\qquad g_{\alpha\alpha} = 1: U_{\alpha} \to GL(\mathbb{R}^n)$$

In general, given any collection of transition maps that satisfy these cocycle conditions, we can construct a [[vector bundle]] in the same manner (which may be different from the tangent bundle).

## Definition in synthetic differential geometry {#InSDG}

The above definitions in ordinary [[differential geometry]] suggest the slogan

+-- {: .standout}

Tangent vectors are infinitesimal curves in a space.

=--

One of the central motivations for [[synthetic differential geometry]] is the desire to provide a context in which this slogan becomes literally formally true.

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition
**(tangent bundle in smooth toposes)**

Let $(\mathcal{T},(R,+,\cdot))$ be a [[smooth topos]] and write  $D = \{\epsilon \in R| \epsilon^2 = 0\}$ for the standard [[infinitesimal space|infinitesimal interval]]. For $X \in \mathcal{T}$ any object (any [[space]] in $\mathcal{T}$), the **tangent bundle** of $X$ is the morphism

$$
  p : T X \to X
$$

with

* $T X \coloneq X^D$ the [[internal hom]] of $D$ into $X$;

* $p = ev_0$ the evaluation map at the origin of $D$

  $ev_0 : (U \stackrel{v}{\to} X^D) \mapsto 
  (U \times {*} \stackrel{Id \times 0}{\to} U \times D
  \stackrel{\bar v}{\to} X)$,

  where $\bar v$ is the hom-[[adjunct]] of $v$.

=--

This definition captures elegantly and usefully the notion of tangent vectors as infinitesimal curves. But it is not guaranteed that the fibers of a synthetic tangent bundle $X^D$ are fiberwise linear, i.e. are fiberwise $R$-modules the way one expects. Objects $X$ for which this is true are [[microlinear space]]s in $\mathcal{T}$. See there for more details.

A [[smooth topos]] $\mathcal{T}$ is called a _well-adapted model_ for [[synthetic differential geometry]] if there is a [[full and faithful functor|full and faithful]] embedding [[Diff]] $\hookrightarrow \mathcal{T}$ of the cageory of [[manifold]]s into $\mathcal{T}$.

Typically, for well adapted models, under this embedding 

* manifolds are [[microlinear space]]s

* the synthetic definition of tangent bundle $X^D$ for $X$ a manifold does coincide with the ordinary notion of $T X$.

Let $\mathbb{L} = (C^\infty Ring^{fin})^{op}$ be the category of [[generalized smooth algebra|smooth loci]]. For $M$ a [[manifold]], the exponential $M^D$ does exist in $\mathbb{L}$ and is isomorphic to the ordinary tangent bundle $T X$ of $X$. (For instance  [[Models for Smooth Infinitesimal Analysis|MSIA, chapter II, prop 1.12]].

There are well-adapted [[smooth topos]]es $\mathcal{Z}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ presented as [[category of sheaves|categories of sheaves]] on $\mathbb{L}$: the first for the [[Grothendieck topology]] where covers are _finite_ open covers, the second where covers are finite open covers and projections ([[Models for Smooth Infinitesimal Analysis|MSIA, chapter VI]]). Both topologies are [[subcanonical coverage|subcanonical]], hence the [[Yoneda embedding]] $Y : \mathbb{L} \to Sh(\mathbb{L})$ does preserve the above property. 

Hence in these models for $X \in Diff$ a [[manifold]], $T X \in Diff$ its ordinary tangent bundle and $s : Diff \to Sh(\mathbb{L})$ the full and faithful embedding, we have isomorphisms

$$
  (s(X))^D  \simeq s(T X)
$$

which respect the bundle maps. 

## As a supermanifold 

The tangent bundle of a manifold $X$ may be interpreted as a [[supermanifold]] in which $X$ has degree $0$ and the tangent vectors have degree $1$.  See [[shifted tangent bundle]].

## Definition for other generalized smooth spaces 

There are useful categories of [[generalized smooth space]]s which are neither categories of manifolds nor [[smooth topos]]es modeling [[synthetic differential geometry]]. But most of them admit useful notions of tangent bundles, too, sometimes more than one.

See [[Frölicher space]] and [[diffeological space]] for the definitions in their context.

Further discussion of axiomatizations in this context is in

* {#CockettCruttwell} [[J.R.B. Cockett]], [[Geoff Cruttwell]], _Differential structure, tangent structure, and SDG_ (2012) ([pdf](http://www.mta.ca/~gcruttwell/publications/sman3.pdf))
 

Discussion for [[diffeological spaces]] is in 

* Carlos Torre, _A tangent bundle for diffeological spaces_ ([arXiv:math/9801046](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/9801046))
