Position is perhaps the most easily-measured [[observable]].

It is one of the basic coordinates in both [[Lagrangean mechanics]] (based on [[state space]], given by position and [[velocity]]) and in [[Hamiltonian mechanics]] (based on [[phase space]], given by position and [[momentum]]).

See also [[Position, Velocity, and Acceleration]].
