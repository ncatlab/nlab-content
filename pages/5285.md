## Idea

The ordinary [[homology]] of a [[topological space]] expressed in terms of the [[chain on a simplicial set|chains on]] its [[singular simplicial complex]].

## Definition

For $X$ a [[topological space]], $Sing X \in $ [[sSet]] its [[singular simplicial complex]] write $\mathbb{Z}[Sing X] \in Ab^{\Delta^{op}}$ for the [[free functor|free]] abelian [[simplicial group]] on $X$. 

Its [[Moore complex]] $N_\bullet(\mathbb{Z}[Sing X]) \in Ch_\bullet^+$ is the **singular complex** of $X$. Its chain [[homology]] is the **singular homology** of $X$.

## Properties

The [[duality|dual]] notion is that of _[[singular cohomology]]_.
