## Idea

The _singular homology_ of a [[topological space]] $X$ is its ordinary [[homology]] expressed in terms of the [[chain on a simplicial set|chains on]] its [[singular simplicial complex]]:

a **singular $n$-[[chain]]** in the singular homology of $X$ is a formal linear combination of [[continuous maps]] $\Delta^n \to X$ (an element in the [[free abelian group]] spanned by these maps) from the topological $n$-simplex, and an $n$-[[cycle]] in the singular homology is such a chain such that its oriented [[boundary]] vanishes. Two singular chains are **homologous** if they differ by a boudary. The **singular homology** of $X$ in degree $n$ is the group of $n$-cycles modulo modulo those that are boundaries.

## Definition
 {#Definition}


Let $X \in $ [[Top]] be [[topological space]]. 
Write $Sing X \in $ [[sSet]] for its [[singular simplicial complex]].

###### Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, a **singular $n$-chain** on $X$ is
an element in the [[free abelian group]] $\mathbb{Z}[(Sing X)_n]$:

a [[formal linear combinations]] of [[singular simplices]] in $X$.

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

These are the [[chains on a simplicial set]] on $Sing X$.

=--

The groups of singular chains combine to the [[simplicial abelian group]]
$\mathbb{Z}[Sing X] \in Ab^{\Delta^{op}}$. 

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

The [[alternating face map complex]] 

$$
  C_\bullet(\mathbb{Z}[Sing X]) \in Ch_\bullet
$$ 

is the **singular complex** of $X$. 

Its [[chain homology]] is the ordinary **singular homology** of $X$.

=--

One usually writes $H_n(X, \mathbb{Z})$ or just $H_n(X)$ for the singular homology of $X$ in degree $n$.

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

This means that a [[singular chain]] is a [[cycle]] if the formal linear combination of the oriented [[boundaries]] of all its constituent [[singular simplices]] sums to 0.

=--

More generally, for $R$ any unital [[ring]] one can form the degreewise [[free module]] $R[Sing X]$ over $R$. The corresponding homology is the _singular homology with coefficients in $R$, denoted $H_n(X,R)$.

Singular homologogy extends to a [[functor]]

$$
  H_n(-,R) : Top \to Ab
$$

from the category [[Top]] of topological spaces to the category [[Ab]] of [[abelian groups]]. 

## Properties

### Homotopy invariance

Singular homology is _homotopy invariant_:

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

If $f : X \to Y$ is a [[continuous map]] between [[topological spaces]] which is a [[homotopy equivalence]], then the induced morphism on singular homology groups

$$
  H_n(f) : H_n(X) \to H_n(Y)
$$

is an [[isomorphism]].

### Relation to homotopy groups
 {#RelationToHomotopyGroups}

The singular [[homology groups]] of a topologial space serve to some extent as an approximation to the [[homotopy groups]] of that space.

* [[Hurewicz homomorphism]]

* [[Hurewicz theorem]]

### Relation to generalized homology

Singular homology computes the [[generalized homology]] with coefficients in the [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum]] $H \mathbb{Z}$ or $H R$.
