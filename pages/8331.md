## Idea

For $C_{\bullet, \bullet}$ a [[double complex]] (in some [[abelian category]] $\mathcal{A}$), its _total complex_ $Tot(C)_\bullet$ is an ordinary complex which in degree $k$ is the [[direct sum]] of all components of total degree $k$.
 

## Definition

Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an [[abelian category]] with arbitrary [[direct sums]].

Write $Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A})$ for the [[category of chain complexes]] in $\mathcal{A}$ and $C_{\bullet, \bullet} \in Ch_\bullet(Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A}))$ for the category of [[double complexes]]. (Hence we use the convention that in a double complex the vertical and horizontal [[differential]] commute with each other.)

###### Defintition

For $C_{\bullet, \bullet} \in Ch_\bullet(Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A}))$ a [[double complex]], it **total complex** $Tot(C)_\bullet \in Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A})$ is the [[chain complex]] whose components are the [[direct sums]]

$$
  Tot(C)_n = \bigoplus_{k+l = n} C_{k,l}
$$

and whose [[differentials]] are give by the [[linear combination]]

$$
  \partial^{Tot}
  \coloneqq
  \partial^C_{vert} + (-1)^{vertical\;degree} \partial^C_{hor}  
  \,. 
$$

### Total homology and spectral sequences
 {#TotalHomology}

+-- {: .num_remark #TotalHomology}
###### Remark

The [[chain homology]] of the total complex $Tot(C)_\bullet$ is sometimes called the **total homology** of the [[double complex]] $C_{\bullet, \bullet}$.

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

A tool for computing the homology of a total complex, hence for computing total homology of a double complex, is the _[[spectral sequence of a double complex]]_.
See there for more details.

### Exactness

+-- {: .num_prop #TotOfBoundedDegreewiseExactIsExact}
###### Proposition

If $C_{\bullet,\bullet}$ is bounded and has [[exact sequence|exact]] rows or coloumns then also $Tot(C)_\bullet$ is exact.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Use the [[acyclic assembly lemma]].

### Relation to total simplicial sets and homotopy colimits

The total chain complex is under [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] to the [[diagonal]] of a [[bisimplicial set]] -- see [[Eilenberg-Zilber theorem]]. As discussed at _[[bisimplicial set]]_, this is [[weak homotopy equivalence|weakly homotopy equivalent]] to the called the _total simplicial set_ of a bisimplicial set.
