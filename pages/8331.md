## Idea

For $C_{\bullet, \bullet}$ a [[double complex]] (in some [[abelian category]] $\mathcal{A}$), its _total complex_ $Tot(C)_\bullet$ is an ordinary complex which in degree $k$ is the [[direct sum]] of all components of total degree $k$.
 

## Definition

The **total complex** of a double complex (under the convention that squares commute) is

$$
  tot_{\oplus}^k = \bigoplus_{m+n=k} X_{n,m}
$$

$$
  d^k_{tot_\oplus}|_{X_{n,m}} = 
  d^v_X + (-1)^\bullet d_X^h 
$$

bla bla

$$
  tot_{\prod}^k = \prod_{m+n=k} X_{n,m}
$$
$$
  d^k_{tot_\prod}|_{X_{n,m}} = 
  d^v_X + (-1)^\bullet d_X^h 
$$

Note that these two coincide when the set of non-zero objects $X_{n,m}$ such that $n + m = k$ is finite, for example, when $X$ is a first quadrant double complex.


## Properties

### Exactness

###### Proposition

If $C_{\bullet,\bullet}$ is bounded and has [[exact sequence|exact]] rows or coloumns then also $Tot(C)_\bullet$ is exact.

###### Proof

Use the [[acyclic assembly lemma]].

### Relation to total simplicial sets

The total chain complex is under [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] to the [[diagonal]] of a [[bisimplicial set]] -- see [[Eilenberg-Zilber theorem]]. As discussed at _[[bisimplicial set]]_, this is [[weak homotopy equivalence|weakly homotopy equivalent]] to the called the _total simplicial set_ of a bisimplicial set.
