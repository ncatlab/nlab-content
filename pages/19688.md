## Idea

The canonical [[homomorphisms]] between [[enriched (∞,1)-categories]] are called _enriched (∞,1)-functors_. This is the generlization to [[(∞,1)-category theory]] of the concept of [[enriched functors]] in [[category theory]].

## Examples

* A _[[spectral Mackey functor]]_ is an enriched $(\infty,1)$-functor, out of a [[Burnside category]], enriched over the [[(∞,1)-category of spectra]].
