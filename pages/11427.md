## Idea

An _abstract circle_ in the sense of ([Moerdijk 96](#Moerdijk96)) is essentially a cellular structure of the form of a [[circle]] $S^1$, in direct analogy to how a [[linear interval]] in the abstract sense is a cellular model of the actual topological interval $[0,1]$.

Indeed, just as linear intervals have as [[classifying topos]] the category of [[simplicial sets]], so abstract circles have as classifying topos the category of [[cyclic sets]] ([Moerdijk 96](#Moerdijk96)).
