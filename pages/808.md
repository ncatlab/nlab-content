The term **connection** can mean any of

* [[connection on a bundle]]

  * [[principal connection]]  
          
    * [[affine connection]]
           
    * [[Cartan connection]]
           
    * [[Ehresmann connection]]

    * [[flat connection]]

  * [[meromorphic connection]]
  * [[Grothendieck connection]]
  * [[simplicial connection]]
  * [[connection in noncommutative geometry]]
* [[Hurewicz connection]]

* [[connection for a differential graded algebra]]

* [[p-connection]] for a smooth map $p$ of smooth schemes or analytic spaces

* [[connection for a coring]]

which are all very similar and often special cases of each other, or a sort of dual construction

* [[hom-connection]],

but it can also mean the non-related notions of 

* [[connection on a cubical set]] and 

* [[connection on a double category]],

which are quite different.
