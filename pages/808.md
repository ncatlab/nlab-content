A **connection** can mean

* [[connection on a bundle]]

  * [[meromorphic connection]]

  * [[Grothendieck connection]]

* [[Hurewicz connection]]

* [[connection for a differential graded algebra]]

* [[p-connection]] for a smooth map $p$ of smooth schemes or analytic spaces

* [[connection for a coring]]

which are all very similar and often special cases of each other, sort of dual construction

* [[hom-connection]],

and also

* [[connection on a cubical set]]

which is something very different.
