## Idea

In analogy to how a [[topological space]] has a [[fundamental ∞-groupoid]], a [[directed space]] has a fundamental [[(∞,1)-category]]

## Definition


+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

By a **[[directed space|directed topological space]]** we here mean specifically a pair $(X,D)$ consisting of 

* a [[topological space]] $X$;

* a subset $D \subset X^{[0,1]}$ of [[continuous map]]s $\gamma : [0,1] \to X$ that are are labeled as being _directed_ , 

* such that 

  * for every orientation preserving [[homeomorphism]] $\phi : [0,1] \to [0,1]$ and every directed map $\gamma$ also $\gamma \circ \phi$ is directed;

  *  for any two directed paths $\gamma_1, \gamma_2$ with $\gamma_1(1) = \gamma_2(0)$ also the concatenation

     $$
       [0,1] \stackrel{\times 2}{\to} [0,2]
       \simeq [0,1] \coprod_{*} [0,1]
       \stackrel{(\gamma_1, \gamma_2)}{\to} 
       X
     $$ 
 
     is a directed path.

A morphism $(X_1,D_1) \to (X_2, D_2)$ of directed spaces is a continuous map $X_1 \to X_2$ that takes elements in $D_1$ to elements in $D_2$.

This defines the [[category]] $DTop$ of directed topological spaces.

###### Example

For $X$ a topological space equipped with the structure of a [[poset]] on its underlying set, say that $\gamma : [0,1] \to X$ is directed if for all $x \leq y$ in $[0,1]$ we have $\gamma(x) \leq \gamma(y)$ in $X$.

+-- {: .un_example}
###### Example

For $\Delta^k_{Top}$ the standard topological $k$-[[simplex]] its _standard directed paths_ are order-preserving maps into its 1-[[simplicial skeleton|skeleton]] (the union of the 1-faces equipped with the evident [[poset]]-structure induced from that on the vertices).

###### Definition

The **fundamental $(\infty,1)$-category** of a directed topological space $(X,D)$ is given by the [[quasi-category]] $\Pi(X,D)$ whose [[k-morphism]]s are those continuous maps

$$
  \sigma : \Delta^k_{Top} \to X
$$

that are morphisms of directed spaces with respect to the [standard directed paths](#DirectedSimplex) in $\Delta^k$.

$$
  \Pi(X,D)_k := Hom_{DTop}(\Delta^k_{Top}, (X,D))
 \,.
$$

###### Lemma

This does indeed define a quasi-category

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Use the standard [[retract]]s $\Delta^k_{Top} \to \Lambda^k_i$ of the topological [[horn]] inclusions $\Lambda^k_i \hookrightarrow \Delta^k$ to fill horns in $\Pi(X,D)$.

For $k \geq 3$ these retracts are the identity on 1-faces, hence trivially preserve the directed paths. For $k = 2$ it is precisely the retract of the _inner_ horn $\Lambda^2_1$ that preserves the directed paths. This is sufficient to satisfy the inner horn filler condition of quasi-categories.

## Properties

+-- {: .un_lemma}
###### Observation


If $X$ is undirected in that _all_ paths are labeled as directed -- $D = X^{[0,1]}$ -- then $\Pi(X,D)$ coincides with the [[fundamental ∞-groupoid]] $\Pi(X)$ of $X$.

The above definition, evident as it may be, does not seem to be in the literature. Articles that do discuss proposals for aspects of fundamental higher categories of directed spaces include

* [[Marco Grandis]], _Directed homotopy theory, I. The fundamental category_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.AT/0111048))

* [[Tim Porter]], _Enriched categories and models for spaces of evolving states_, Theoretical Computer Science, 405, (2008), pp. 88--100.

* [[Tim Porter]], _Enriched categories and models for spaces of
dipaths. A discussion document and overview of some techniques_ ([pdf](http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2007/898/pdf/06341.PorterTimothy.Paper.898.pdf))

The [[simplicially enriched categories]] obtained from a directed space according to the latter have as morphisms directed paths, and as 2-morphisms _directed homotopies_  (paths of directed paths). This is in contrast to the above definition, where the 2-cells away from their boundary are unconstrained.

Accordingly it seems that the definitio by Porter produces indeed not a Kan-complex enriched category (a model for an $(\infty,1)$-category) but a quasi-category-enriched category, hence actually a model for an [[(∞,2)-categories]], a candidate for the _fundamental $(\infty,2)$-category_ of a space. Generaly, in the fundamental [[(∞,n)-category]] the $(k \leq n)$-cells should be directed maps, and the $k \gt n$-cells be otherwise unconstrained.
