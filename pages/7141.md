## Definition

A (complete) _archimedean valued field_ is a [[field]] equipped with an [[archimedean absolute value]] (and [[complete field|complete]] with respect to it).


## Properties

One of [[Ostrowski's theorems]] says that for $k$ a field [[complete field|complete]] with respect to an [[absolute value]] ${\vert - \vert}$ either the absolute value is archimedean, in which case $k$ is either the field of [[real numbers]] or of [[complex numbers]], or the absolute value is non-archimedean.
