## Definition

An [[endofunctor]] on a [[category]] $\mathcal{A}$ is _pointed_ if it is a [[pointed object]] in the [[functor category|endofunctor category]] in the sense that it is equipped with a morphism from the [[identity]] functor.

###### Definition

An [[endofunctor]] $S:\mathcal{A}\to \mathcal{A}$ is called **pointed** if it is equipped with a [[natural transformation]] $\sigma:Id_\mathcal{A} \to S$.  It is called **well-pointed** if $S\sigma = \sigma S$ (as natural transformations $S\to S^2$).

## Properties

### Relation to free algebras

The pointed [[algebras over an endofunctor]] on a pointed endofunctor induce a theory of _[[transfinite construction of free algebras]]_ [[algebra over an endofunctor|over]] general endofunctors.

## Examples

A [[monad]] can be regarded as a pointed endofunctor where $\sigma$ is its unit.  Such an endofunctor is well-pointed precisely when the monad is [[idempotent monad|idempotent]].
