## Various

On the computation of the [[anomaly cancellation]] now known as the [[Green-Schwarz mechanism]] in [[heterotic string theory]] (also known as [The First Superstring Revolution](http://theory.caltech.edu/people/jhs/strings/str133.html)):

> {#WeMustBeGettingPrettyClose} MICHAEL GREEN: I do remember a particular moment, when John Schwarz and I were talking at the blackboard and working out these numbers which had to fit, and they just had to match exactly. I remember joking with John Schwarz at that moment, because there was thunder and lightning -- there was a big mountain storm in Aspen at that moment -- and I remember saying something like, you know, "We must be getting pretty close, because the gods are trying to prevent us completing this calculation." And, indeed, they did match.
