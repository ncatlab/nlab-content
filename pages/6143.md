## Definition

A priori a __locally compact topological group__ is a [[topological group]] $G$ whose underlying [[topological space]] is [[locally compact topological space|locally compact]]. 

Typically it is also assumed that $G$ is [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]]. (Notice that if not, then $G/\overline{\{1\}}$ is Hausdorff.). 

One often says just "locally compact group".

## Properties

### In harmonic analysis

We take here locally compact groups $G$ to be also Hausdorff. 

Locally compact topological groups are the standard object of study in classical abstract [[harmonic analysis]]. The crucial properties of locally compact groups is that they posses a left (right) [[Haar measure]] $\rho$ and that $L^1(\rho)$ has a structure of a 
[[Banach algebra|Banach]] $*$-[[star-algebra|algebra]]. 

A left (right) [[Haar measure]] on a locally compact topological group is a nonzero [[Radon measure]] which is invariant under the left (right) multiplications by elements in the group. A topological subgroup $H$ of a locally compact topological group $G$ is itself locally compact (in [[induced topology]]) iff it is closed in $G$.
