A __skewfield__ (also spelled skew-field) or a __division ring__ is a unital [[ring]] where each nonzero element has an [[inverse]] (but zero does not). A commutative skewfield is called a [[field]], but sometimes in specialized works on skewfields one often says simply field for a skewfield.

Very often textbooks develop [[linear algebra]] in the generality of division rings, namely the usual notions of basis, dimension, linear map, matrix of a linear map with respect to two bases and so on, pass without changes for left or right [[vector spaces]] over a division ring.

The most famous noncommutative example is the skewfield of [[quaternion]]s. The [[Frobenius theorem]] states that apart from the fields of [[real number|real]] and [[complex number]]s and quaternions, there are no associative finite-dimensional [[division algebra]]s over the real numbers; and even if one includes nonassociative finite-dimensional division algebras one obtains only one more example (the [[octonion]]s).

In [[constructive mathematics]] and [[internalization|internally]], the same issues appear for skewfields as for [[fields]], and may be dealt with in the same way.
