## Definition

A __skewfield__ (also spelled skew-field) or a __division ring__ is a [[unitality|unital]] [[ring]] where each non-[[zero]] [[element]] has an [[inverse]] (but [[zero]] does not). A [[commutative ring|commutative]] skewfield is called a _[[field]]_, but sometimes in specialized works on skewfields one often says simply _field_ for _skewfield_.

In [[constructive mathematics]] and [[internalization|internally]], the same issues appear for skewfields as for [[fields]], and may be dealt with in the same way.

[[linear algebra|Linear algebra]] is often understood in the generality of division rings, namely the usual notions of _[[linear basis]]_, _[[dimension]]_, _[[linear map]]_, [[matrix]] of a linear map with respect to two bases and so on, and even [[Gauss elimination]] procedure, hold without changes for left or right [[vector spaces]] over a division ring.

## Examples

The most famous noncommutative example is the skewfield of [[quaternions]]. 

The [[Frobenius theorem]] states that apart from the fields of [[real number|real]] and [[complex numbers]] and quaternions, there are no associative finite-dimensional [[division algebras]] over the real numbers; and even if one includes nonassociative finite-dimensional division algebras one obtains only one more example (the [[octonions]]). See at _[[normed division algebra]]_ for more on this.
