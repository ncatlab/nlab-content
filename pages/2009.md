## Definition

A __skewfield__ (also spelled skew-field) or a __division ring__ is a unital [[ring]] where each nonzero element has an [[inverse]] (but zero does not). A commutative skewfield is called a [[field]], but sometimes in specialized works on skewfields one often says simply field for a skewfield.

In [[constructive mathematics]] and [[internalization|internally]], the same issues appear for skewfields as for [[fields]], and may be dealt with in the same way.

[[linear algebra|Linear algebra]] is often understood in the generality of division rings, namely the usual notions of _[[linear basis]]_, _[[dimension]]_, _[[linear map]]_, [[matrix]] of a linear map with respect to two bases and so on, and even [[Gauss elimination]] procedure, hold without changes for left or right [[vector spaces]] over a division ring.

## Examples

The most famous noncommutative example is the skewfield of [[quaternions]]. 

The [[Frobenius theorem]] states that apart from the fields of [[real number|real]] and [[complex numbers]] and quaternions, there are no associative finite-dimensional [[division algebras]] over the real numbers; and even if one includes nonassociative finite-dimensional division algebras one obtains only one more example (the [[octonions]]). See at _[[normed division algebra]]_ for more on this.
