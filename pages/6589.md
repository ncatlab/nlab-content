### Idea ###

The fixed point of a [[renormalization]]-group (RG) transform applied to a [[field theory]] should, intuitively, be described by a theory which is scale-invariant.  The **Zamolodchikov $c$-theorem** makes this precise:  for any renormalizable 2D field theory, there exists a function $c(g)$ of its coupling constants $g = (g_1,g_2,\ldots)$ which

* decreases monotonically with successive RG transforms, and
* at the fixed point of the RG, is equal to the [[Virasoro algebra|central charge]] of the [[conformal field theory]] which describes that critical point.

Attempts to find analogues for the 2D $c$-theorem in higher [[dimensions]] have involved versions of [[holographic principle|holographic duality]] such as the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]].
