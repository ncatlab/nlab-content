## Definition

Given a [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$, then a _Casimir element_ or _Casimir [[invariant]]_ is an element in the [[center]] of its [[universal enveloping algebra]] $U(\mathfrak{g})$. 

Often this is considered with some [[Lie algebra representation]] in mind, in which case one speaks of _Casimir operators_.
