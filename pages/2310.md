## Definition

A _peridodic cohomology theory_ is an

[[even cohomology theory|even]] [[multiplicative cohomology theory|multiplicative]] [[cohomology theory]] $E$ with a [[Bott element]] $\beta \in E^2({*})$ which is invertible (under multiplication in the [[cohomology ring]] of the point) so that multiplication by it induces an [[isomorphism]] 

$$
  (-)\cdot \beta : E^*({*}) \simeq E^{*+2}({*})
  \,.
$$

Compare with the notion of [[weakly periodic cohomology theory]].
