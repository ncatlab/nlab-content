## Idea ##

A **link** is a generalisation of a [[knot]] where one is allowed more than one component.  Many [[knot invariants]] extend to [[link invariants]] and for many such invariants, one needs to know this extension to compute it even for a knot.  Thus the study of links and knots is inextricably intertwined.

###### Definition
A **link** is an [[embedding]] of a finite number of copies of the [[circle]].  The embedding is usually taken in $\mathbb{R}^3$, or its one-point [[compactification]], $S^3$.

It is possible to generalise this to more varied sources and targets.

Links can be studied in a number of ways depending on the notion of equivalence that is used.  Coming from knot theory, one considers equivalence up to [[isotopy]]; that is, two links are equivalent if there is a homotopy between them which is an embedding for all times.  A weaker notion was consider by [Milnor](#jmLinkGroups) wherein the components of the link are allowed to pass through themselves, but not through other components.  That is, when restricted to each component it must be an immersion for all times, and the images of the components must always be disjoint.


## Examples ##

#### The Hopf Link ####

This is perhaps the simplest non-trivial link, consisting of two components linked once.
