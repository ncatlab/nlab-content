
The European mathematician __Alexander Grothendieck__ (in French sometimes Alexandre Grothendieck), created a very influential body of work foundational for ([[algebraic geometry|algebraic]]) [[geometry]] but also for modern [[mathematics]] more generally. He is widely regarded as a singularly important figure of 20th century mathematics and his ideas continue to be highly influential in the 21st century.

Initially working on [[topological vector spaces]] and [[analysis]], Grothendieck then made revolutionary advances in [[algebraic geometry]] by developing [[sheaf and topos theory]] and [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] and formulating algebraic geometry in these terms ([[locally ringed spaces]], [[schemes]]). Later [[topos theory]] further developed independently and today serves as the foundation also for other kinds of [[geometry]]. Notably its [[homotopy theory|homotopy theoretic]] refinement to [[higher topos theory]] serves as the foundation for modern [[derived algebraic geometry]].

## Texts by Grothendieck

Grothendieck's geometric work is documented in texts known as [[EGA]] (with [[Dieudonné]]), an early account [[FGA]], and the many volume account [[SGA]] of the seminars at l'IHÉS, Bures-sur-Yvette, where he was based at the time. (See the [wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Grothendieck) for some indication of the story from there until the early 1980s.)

In the late 1970s and early 1980s Grothendieck wrote several documents that have been of outstanding importance in the origins of the theory that underlies the [[nPOV]].  These include

* _La Longue Marche à travers la Théorie de Galois_ (1600 manuscript pages written between January and June 1981, plus addenda etc. which double its length!) (see [[Long March]] for some discussion of the ideas.)

* _[[Esquisse d'un programme]]_, (January 1984), in which Grothendieck sketches out a vaste programme of research, encorporating many of the ideas from [[Long March]]. A copy is available [here](http://www.math.jussieu.fr/~leila/grothendieckcircle/EsquisseFr.pdf). It is discussed in brief at [[Esquisse d'un programme|Grothendieck's Esquisse]].

*  _À la poursuite des Champs_ (also entitled ''[[Pursuing Stacks]]'').  
It starts with a short (12 page) letter to Quillen, dated 19 Feb. 1983, but then discusses a wide ranging vision of homotopy theory and its applicability to problems in algebraic and arithmetic geometry. 

*  _[[Les Dérivateurs]]_ (another 2000 page manuscript taking  up some of the themes in Pursuing Stacks, section 69) Dating from the end of 1990 and the start of 1991.

In the same time he also wrote voluminous intellectual memoirs _Recoltes et Semailles_.
