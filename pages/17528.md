## Idea

The general concept of [[localization]] applied to the ([[derived category|derived]]) [[category of abelian groups]] yield the concept of _localization of abelian groups_.

The two main examples are

1. classical localization;

1. completion

at [[prime numbers]] $p$. Here "classical $p$-localization" is localization at the morphism $0 \to \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$, while $p$-completion is localization at the morphism $0 \to \mathbb{Z}[p^{-1}]$.

## Definition

+-- {: .num_remark #ExtAb}
###### Remark

Recall that [[Ext]]-groups $\Ext^\bullet(A,B)$ between [[abelian groups]] $A, B \in $ [[Ab]] are concentrated in degrees 0 and 1 ([prop.](free+resolution#AbelianGroupHasFreeResolutionOfLength2)). Since

$$
  Ext^0(A,B) \simeq Hom(A,B)
$$

is the plain [[hom-functor]], this means that there is only one possibly non-vanishing Ext-group $Ext^1$, therefore often abbreviated to just "$Ext$":

$$
  Ext(A,B)
   \coloneqq
  Ext^1(A,B)
  \,.
$$

=--


+-- {: .num_defn #AbelianGroupLocal}
###### Definition

Let $A$ be an [[abelian group]]. 

Then an [[abelian group]] $K$ is called **$A$-local** if all the [[Ext]]-groups from $A$ to $B$ vanish:

$$
  Ext^\bullet(A,K) \simeq 0
$$

hence equivalently (remark \ref{ExtAb}) if

$$
  Hom(A,K) \simeq 0
  \;\;\;\;\;
    and
  \;\;\;\;\;
  Ext(A,K) \simeq 0
  \,.
$$

A [[homomorphism]] of abelian groups $f \colon B \longrightarrow C$ is called **$A$-local** if for all $A$-local groups $K$ the function

$$
  Hom(f,K) \;\colon\; Hom(B,K) \longrightarrow Hom(A,K)
$$

is a [[bijection]].

A homomorphism of abelian groups

$$
  \eta \;\colon\; B \longrightarrow L_A B
$$

is called an **$A$-localization** if

1. $L_A X$ is $A$-local;

1. $\eta$ is a $A$-local.

+-- {: .num_defn  #pInvertedInZ}
###### Definition

For $p$ a [[prime number]], write 

$$
  \mathbb{Z}[1/p]
   \coloneqq
  \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}
  \left(
    \mathbb{Z}
      \overset{p \cdot (-)}{\longrightarrow}
    \mathbb{Z}
      \overset{p \cdot (-)}{\longrightarrow}
    \mathbb{Z}
      \overset{}{\longrightarrow}
    \cdots
  \right)
$$

for the [[colimit]] (in [[Ab]]) over iterative applications of multiplication by $p$ on the [[integers]].

This is the [[abelian group]] generated by formal expressions $\frac{1}{p^k}$ for $k \in \mathbb{N}$, subject to the relations

$$
  (p \cdot n) \frac{1}{p^{k+1}}
  =
  n \frac{1}{p^k}
  \,.
$$

Equivalently it is the abelian group underlying the [[localization of a ring|ring localization]] $\mathbb{Z}[1/p]$.

###### Definition

For $p$ a [[prime number]], then localization of abelian groups (def. \ref{AbelianGroupLocal}) at $\mathbb{Z}[1/p]$ (def. \ref{pInvertedInZ}) is called **$p$-completion of abelian groups**.

###### Lemma

An [[abelian group]] $A$ is $p$-complete according to def. \ref{AbelianGrouppComplete} precisely if both the [[limit]] as well as the [[lim^1]] of the sequence

$$
  \cdots \overset{}{\longrightarrow}
  A \overset{p}{\longrightarrow}
  A \overset{p}{\longrightarrow}
  A \overset{p}{\longrightarrow} A
$$

vanishes:

$$
  \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}
  \left(
      \cdots \overset{}{\longrightarrow}
  A \overset{p}{\longrightarrow}
  A \overset{p}{\longrightarrow}
  A \overset{p}{\longrightarrow} A
  \right)
   \simeq
  0
$$

and

$$
  \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}^1
  \left(
      \cdots \overset{}{\longrightarrow}
  A \overset{p}{\longrightarrow}
  A \overset{p}{\longrightarrow}
  A \overset{p}{\longrightarrow} A

## Classical localization at/away from primes

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, write $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ for the [[cyclic group]] of [[order of a group|order]] $n$.

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

An [[abelian group]] $A$ is $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$-local precisely if the operation 

$$
  p \cdot (-)
  \;\colon\;
  A \longrightarrow A
$$

of multiplication by $p$ is an [[isomorphism]], hence if "$p$ is invertible in $A$".

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

It is clear that 

$$
  Hom(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}, A) 
    \simeq 
  \{
    a \in A \;\vert\; p \cdot a = 0
  \}
$$

(since $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ is generated by its element 1 a morphism $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z} \to A$ is fixed by the image $a$ of this element, and the only relation on 1 in $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ is that $p \cdot 1 = 0$.)

Moreover, observe that 

$$
  Ext^1(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z},A)
    \simeq
  A/p A
  \,.
$$

To see this consider the canonical [[free resolution]]

$$
  0 \to \mathbb{Z} \overset{p \cdot (-)}{\longrightarrow} \mathbb{Z} \longrightarrow \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z} \to 0
$$

which exhibits the [[Ext]]-group in degree 1 as part of the [[short exact sequence]]

$$
  0
  \to
  Hom(\mathbb{Z},A)
  \overset{Hom(p\cdot(-),A)}{\longrightarrow}
  Hom(\mathbb{Z}, A)
  \longrightarrow
  Ext^1(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z},A)
  \to 0
  \,,
$$

where the morphism on the left is equivalently $A \overset{p \cdot (-)}{\to} A$.

Hence by def. \ref{AbelianGroupLocal} $A$ is $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$-local precisely if 

$$
  \{
    a \in A \;\vert\; p \cdot a = 0
  \}
  \simeq
  0
$$

and if

$$
  A / p A \simeq 0
  \,.
$$

Both these conditions are equivalent to multiplication by $p$ being invertible.

+-- {: .num_defn #InvertingPrimes}
###### Definition

For $J \subset \mathbb{N}$ a set of [[prime numbers]], consider the [[direct sum]] $\underset{p \in J}{\otimes} \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ of [[cyclic group]] of [[order of a group|order]] $p$.

The operation of $\underset{p \in J}{\otimes} \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$-localization of abelian groups according to def. \ref{AbelianGroupLocal} is called **inverting the primes** in $J$.

Specifically 

1. for $J = \{p\}$ a single prime then $\mathbb[Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$-localization is called **localization away from $p$**;

1. for $J$ the set of all primes except $p$ then $\underset{p \in J}{\otimes} \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$-localization is called **localization at $p$;

1. for $J$ the set of all primes, then $\underset{p \in J}{\otimes} \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$-localizaton is called **[[rationalization]]**..

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

The terminology in def. \ref{InvertingPrimes} is motivated by the following perspective of [[arithmetic geometry]]:

Generally for $R$ a [[commutative ring]], then an $R$-[[module]] is equivalently a [[quasicoherent sheaf]] on the [[spectrum of a commutative ring|spectrum of the ring]] $Spec(R)$.

In the present case $R = \mathbb{Z}$ is the [[integers]] and [[abelian groups]] are identified with $\mathbb{Z}$-modules. Hence we may think of an abelian group $A$ equivalently as a [[quasicoherent sheaf]] on [[Spec(Z)]]. 

The "[[ring of functions]]" on [[Spec(Z)]] is the integers, and a point in $Spec(\mathbb{Z})$ is labeled by a [[prime number]] $p$, thought of as generating the ideal of functions on [[Spec(Z)]] which vanish at that point. The [[residue field]] at that point is $\mathbb{F}_p = \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$.

Inverting a prime means [[forcing]] $p$ to become invertible, which, by this characterization, it is precisely _away_ from that point which it labels. The localization of an abelian group at $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ hence corresponds to the restriction of the corresponding quasicoherent sheaf over $Spec(\mathbb{Z})$ to the complement of the point labeled by $p$.

Similarly localization _at_ $p$ is localization away from all points except $p$.
