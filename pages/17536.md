## Grothendieck topology on bornological coarse spaces

The category of [[bornological coarse spaces]] admits
the structure of a [[site with an interval]].
See §3 in Bunke and Engel for the relevant definitions.

## Definition

The $\infty$-category of motivic coarse spaces is obtained
from the $\infty$-category of $\infty$-sheaves on the site of [[bornological coarse spaces]]
by performing the reflective localization with respect to the maps $I\times X\to X$
for any representable $X$, where $I=\{0,1\}$ is the interval object in bornological coarse spaces.
(This step is formally identical to the one used to construct [[motivic spaces]].)
Next, we also localize with respect to morphisms of representables $\emptyset\to E$,
where $E$ is a flasque bornological coarse space, as defined in Definition 3.19 of Bunke and Engel.
Finally, we localize with respect to morphisms of presheaves of the form $$colim_{U\in C}X_U\to X$,
for any $C\in C$, where $X_U$ is obtained from $X$ using the same bornology
and the coarse structure generated by a single element $U$.
