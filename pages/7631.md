## Warning

*The term 'frame' is used in a different sense here than in [[geometric logic]]; see [[frame]].  The usage here is analogous to [[Kripke frames]] in [[modal logic]].*

## Idea

A **ternary frame** is a way of presenting a model for a [[substructural logic]] (such as [[linear logic]] and [[relevant logic]]) in terms of a set of "worlds" or "states of information" and a ternary [[relation]].

## Definition

A **ternary frame** is a set $A$ together with a ternary relation $R$ on $A$; we write $R x y z$ when $R$ holds of three elements $x,y,z\in A$.

We may additionally ask that $A$ have a [[partial ordering]]; in this case we demand the compatibility condition that if $R x y z$ and $x'\le x$, $y'\le y$, and $z\le z'$, then also $R x' y' z'$.

## Modeling substructural logic

We can model [[logic]] using a ternary frame with a "forcing" or "satisfaction" relation between points of $A$ and formulas.  We begin by assigning to each [[atomic formula]] a set of points of $A$ which satisfy it.  If $A$ has a partial order, as above, then we ask each of these sets to be up-closed.

The [[logical connectives]] can then be defined inductively by clauses such as the following:

* $x \Vdash P \& Q$ (the negative [[conjunction]]) if and only if $x\Vdash P$ and $x\Vdash Q$.
* $x \Vdash P \oplus Q$ (the positive [[disjunction]]) if and only if $x \Vdash P$ or $x\Vdash Q$.
* $x \Vdash \mathbf{0}$ (the positive [[falsity]]) never.
* $x \Vdash \top$ (the negative [[truth]]) always.
* $x \Vdash P \multimap Q$ (the one-sided linear implication) if and only if for all $x,y,z$, if $R x y z$ and $y\Vdash P$, then $z\Vdash Q$.
* $x \Vdash P \otimes Q$ (the positive conjunction) if and only if there exist $y,z$ such that $R y z x$ and $y\Vdash P$ and $z\Vdash Q$.

The logic obtained thereby will generally be [[substructural logic|substructural]]: it need not satisfy the structural rules like [[weakening rule|weakening]], [[contraction rule|contraction]], or even [[exchange rule|exchange]].  On this page, we have used the notation for substructural connectives from [[linear logic]].

## Additional structure

We can impose properties or structure on the ternary frame to affect the logic.  For instance, if $R x y z$ implies $R y x z$, then the logic we obtain will satisfy the exchange rule.

We also need additional structure in order to model positive truth, negative falsity, negative disjunction, and negation.

### Truth sets

A **truth set** in an ordered ternary frame is a subset $T\subseteq A$ such that $x\le y$ if and only if there exists a $t\in T$ with $R t x y$.  Alternatively, given an unordered ternary frame $A$ and a subset $T$, we could *define* $x\le y$ in this way, and then require as a property of $T$ that the resulting relation is a [[partial order]].

If $T$ is a truth set, then it makes sense to define

* $x \Vdash \mathbf{1}$ (the positive truth) if and only if $x\in T$.

### Compatibility relations

One way to model negation (and thereby obtain negative falsity $\bot$ and negative disjunction $\parr$ by duality from positive truth $\mathbf{1}$ and positive conjunction $\otimes$) is with a **compatibility relation**, which is just a binary relation $C$.  If $A$ has a partial order, we demand additionally that if $x C y$ and $x'\le x$ and $y\le y'$, then $x' C y'$.

Given such a $C$, we define

* $x \Vdash \neg P$ if and only if for all $y$, if $x C y$ then not $y\Vdash P$.

### Falsity sets

Negation can alternatively be modeled using a *false set*.  Suppose given a subset $F\subseteq A$, to be the interpretation of the negative falsity $\bot$:

* $x\Vdash \bot$ if and only if $x\in F$.

We can then, if we wish, interpret negation and negative disjunction by defining $\neg P \coloneqq (P\multimap \bot)$ and $P\parr Q \coloneqq \neg (\neg P \otimes \neg Q)$.

The latter is most sensible if negation is involutive, which it need not be in general --- that is, if $x \Vdash \neg \neg P$ we need not have $x\Vdash P$.  One solution to this (if we want negation to be involutive) is to close up $\Vdash$ under double-negation.  This entails replacing the clauses defining the interpretation of the positive connectives $\otimes$, $\oplus$, $\mathbf{1}$, and $\mathbf{0}$ with their double-negation closure.  This is commonly done in the phase space semantics for linear logic (see below).


## From ternary frames to quantales

Since the models above associate to formulas *subsets* of $A$, it seems natural to describe them in a purely algebraic way using structure on the [[powerset]] of $A$.  In the case when $A$ is a poset, instead of the powerset of $A$ we must use the set of up-closed subsets of $A$.  Since this subsumes the unordered case (use the discrete ordering), we henceforth assume $A$ to be a poset, with $R$ having the assumed compatibility relation.

In fact, this axiom (which we repeat here for the reader's convenience):

* if $R x y z$ and $x'\le x$, $y'\le y$, and $z\le z'$, then also $R x' y' z'$.

says precisely that $R$ is a $\mathbf{2}$-[[enriched category|enriched]] [[profunctor]] $A^{op} \times A^{op} &#x21F8; A^{op}$.  (Here we are identifying posets with $\mathbf{2}$-enriched categories, where $\mathbf{2}$ is the [[interval category]].)

Therefore, by [[Day convolution]], $R$ induces a binary tensor product on the $\mathbf{2}$-enriched [[presheaf category]] $\mathbf{2}^A$, which is precisely the poset of up-closed sets in $A$.  This tensor product is precisely the above interpretation of $\otimes$.  By the usual Day convolution arguments, this tensor product functor has both left and right adjoints, which are precisely the interpretation of $\multimap$ and its dual.

Of course, the interpretations of $\&$ and $\oplus$ are just the categorical product and coproduct in $\mathbf{2}^A$.  Similarly, that of $\mathbf{0}$ and $\top$ are the initial and terminal objects.

A truth set $T$ corresponds to a profunctor $1 &#x21F8; A^{op}$ which is a unit for the pro-multiplication $R$.  Therefore, in this case the tensor product on $\mathbf{2}^A$ has a unit object, which is precisely $T$, the interpretation of the positive truth $\mathbf{1}$.

If we were to additionally add the assumption that $R$ is *associative*, in the sense that

* there exists a $z$ with $R x y z$ and $R z u v$ if and only if there exists a $w$ with $R x w v$ and $R y u w$

then $A^{op}$ would become a [[promonoidal category|promonoidal]] poset, and hence $\mathbf{2}^A$ would be a complete and cocomplete closed monoidal poset, i.e. a [[quantale]].

... compatibility relations, satisfying some axioms, should make $\mathbf{2}^A$ [[*-autonomous category|*-autonomous]]...

## Examples

### Phase spaces

If $A$ is a [[magma]] with multiplication $\cdot$, then we can make it a ternary frame by defining $R x y z$ to mean $x \cdot y = z$.  More generally, if $A$ is a poset equipped with a binary multiplication $\cdot$, we can make it an ordered ternary frame by defining $R x y z$ to mean $x \cdot y \le z$.

If $\cdot$ has a unit object $t$, then $T = \{t\}$ (in the unordered case) or $T = \{x | t \le x \}$ (in the ordered case) is a truth set.

Categorically, this corresponds to the usual way of regarding a [[monoidal category]] as a [[promonoidal category]].

In the special case when $A$ is a commutative [[monoid]] equipped with a "false set" $F$ as above (usually written $\bot$) in this context, this semantics for linear logic is called *phase space* semantics.  It is usually expressed in terms of the quantale $\mathbf{2}^A$ obtained by Day convolution, but after passing to fixed points of the double-negation monad (in order to obtain an involutive negation).  In this context, fixed points of $\neg\neg$ are referred to as *facts*.

It is also possible to interpret the exponential modalities $!$ and $?$ of linear logic using phase space semantics.  For instance, we can define

* $x \Vdash !P$ if and only if $x$ belongs to the $\neg\neg$-closure of the set of all idempotents $y$ such that $y\Vdash P \& \mathbf{1}$.

and obtain $?P$ by duality.

Phase space semantics is *complete* for [[linear logic]], in the sense that a formula is provable if and only if in any phase space semantics we have $1\vDash P$, where $1$ is the unit element of the monoid $A$.
