## Idea

A _ribbon graph_ (also called _fat graph_ ) is a finite connected [[graph]] equipped with a cyclic ordering on the half edges incident to each vertex; it is
also required that the valence of each vertex is at least 3. 

To each ribbon graph, one can associate an [[orientation|oriented]] [[surface]] with [[boundary]] by replacing edges
by thin oriented rectangles (ribbons) and glueing them together at all vertices according to the chosen cyclic order.

## Definition

Set theoretically, a __ribbon graph__ is given by a finite set of half edges, equipped with two (unordered) [[partitions]]:

(i) into subsets which we call *vertices*; each with cardinality at least 3

(ii) into *pairs of half-edges* called *edges*

and with a cyclic ordering of ("on") each vertex. Without a cyclic ordering, 
we will just say graph. 

The half-edges belonging to the same vertex are said to be *incident*. An edge is a *loop* if its constituent half-edges are incident. 

## Further constructions

Given any edge $e$ in a graph $\Gamma$, 
we can collapse it to a new graph $\Gamma/e$ by merging the two vertices
containing the edge and removing both half edges.  

A forest $F$ (disjoint union of trees) spans a graph $\Gamma$ if it contains all of its vertices. One can collapse $\Gamma$ to $\Gamma/F$ by collapsing each tree to a separate vertex. Then the edges in $\Gamma/F$ are the edges of $\Gamma$ which do not lie in any tree in $F$; the vertices of $\Gamma/F$ correspond to the sets of leaves of the component trees of $F$.  

A morphism of graphs $\Gamma_0\to\Gamma_1$ is defined as an isomorphism $\Gamma_0/F\to\Gamma_1$ where $F$ is a spanning forest of $\Gamma_0$. Morphisms of such graphs are both epi and mono. 

For  a ribbon graph, the set of leaves of any tree inherits a cyclic order. Thus $\Gamma/F$ has a canonical structure a ribbon graph. This makes the following definition possible: A morphism of ribbon graphs is the morphism of underlying graphs which respects the ordering on the vertices; i.e.  $\Gamma_0/F\to\Gamma_1$ is an isomorphism of ribbon graphs. Every endomorphism of a ribbon graph is an automorphism and for any two ribbon graphs $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma'$, the set $Aut(\Gamma)$ acts freely on $Hom(\Gamma,\Gamma')$ on the right and $Aut(\Gamma')$ acts freely on $Hom(\Gamma,\Gamma')$ from the left. 

Let $\mathcal{Fat}$ denote the category of ribbon graphs and ribbon automorphisms. Strebel proved that the geometric realization $|\mathcal{Fat}|$ of the category of ribbon graphs decomposes into a direct sum of classifying spaces of all [[mapping class group]]s $M^s_g$ 

$$
|\mathcal{Fat}| = \coprod_{g,s} BM^s_g
$$

$M^s_g$ is a mapping class group of a surface of genus $g$ with $s$ punctures. Alternatively, one can instead of the geometric realization take a moduli space of ribbon graphs with metric. A **metric** on a ribbon graph is a positive real valued function on the set of edges. 


## Properties

For the following we represent a fat graph by

* a set $V$ of vertices;

* a set $H$ of half-edges;

* a source map $s : H \to V$;

* an involution $i :  H \to H$ which sends each half-edge to its partner half-edge;

* an permutation $\sigma : H \to H$ which gives the cyclic order on the edges.


### Geometric realization

For $\Gamma$ a fat graph, write $\Sigma_\Gamma$ for the [[surface]] that it defines.


+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The [[boundary]] components of $\Sigma_\Gamma$ are naturally identified with the [[cycle]]s of $\sigma \circ i : H \to H$, as well as with the cycles of $i \circ \sigma$.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The [[genus]] of $\Sigma_\Gamma$ is

$$
  g = \frac{1}{2}
   \left(
     - \vert V\vert - \vert E\vert - \vert bounary components\vert + 2
   \right)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

For every surface $S$ with boundary, there is a fat graph $\Gamma$ and a [[homeomorphism]]

$$
  S \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}  \Sigma_\Gamma
  \,.
$$

=--

### Moduli space of surfaces

Write $FatGraph^c_3$ for the [[full subcategory]] of fat graphs on the connected fat graphs for which every vertex has valence at leat 3. Write $\vert FatGraph^c_3 \vert \in $ [[Top]] for the [[geometric realization]] of this [[category]]. For $\Sigma$ a [[surface]], write $\Gamma_Sigma$ for its [[mapping class group]] and $B \Gamma_\Sigma$ for the corresponding [[classifying space]].

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

There is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]]

$$
  \vert FatGraph^c_3 \vert \simeq
  \coprod_{[\Sigma]} B \Gamma_\Sigma
  \,,
$$

where on the right thr coproduct ranges over isomorphism classes of orientable, closed 2-dimensional manifolds with $n \geq 1$ marked points, except those for which $(g,n) = (0,1)$ or  $(g, n) = (0,2)$.

=--

In various guises this theorem has been proven by [Costello](#Costello), [Kontsevich92](#Kontsevich92), [Igusa02](#Igusa02), [Penner](#Penner), [Strebel](#Strebel).

The restriction to valence $\geq 3$ can be dropped:

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

There is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]]

$$
  \vert FatGraph^c \vert \simeq
  B U(1) \coprod B U(1) \coprod_{[\Sigma]} B \Gamma_\Sigma
  \,,
$$

where again on the right thr coproduct ranges over isomorphism classes of orientable, closed 2-dimensional manifolds with $n \geq 1$ marked points, except those for which $(g,n) = (0,1)$ or  $(g, n) = (0,2)$. The two extra copies of $B U(1)$ corespond to these two exceptional cases.

=--

This has been shown in ([Godin](#Godin)). One of the $B U(1)$-summands is also produced in ([Igusa02](#Igusa02)). A detailed complete proof appears as ([Kuipers, theorem 3.59](#Kuipers)).
