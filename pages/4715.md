## Idea

A _ribbon graph_ (also called _fat graph_ ) is a finite connected [[graph]] equipped with a cyclic ordering on the half edges incident to each vertex; it is
also required that the valence of each vertex is at least 3. 

To each ribbon graph, one can associate an [[orientation|oriented]] [[surface]] with [[boundary]] by replacing edges
by thin oriented rectangles (ribbons) and glueing them together at all vertices according to the chosen cyclic order.

## Definition

The following definion of an ordinary [[graph]] is not the standard one used for ordinary graphs, but is easily seen to be equivalent to it, while being the right starting point for describing ribbon graphs.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A **[[graph]]** is a quadruple $(V, H, s, i)$, where

* $V$ is a [[set]], called the **set of vertices**;

* $H$ is a [[set]], called the **set of half-edges**

* $s : H \to V$ is a [[function]], thought of as sending each half-edge to the vertex that it is _incident_ on;

* $i : H \to H$ is a [[involution|involutive]] [[function]] without fixed points, thought of as sending each half-edge to its other half.

The set of [[cycle]]s of $i$ is the set $E$ of full edges.

A [[homomorphism]] of graphs is a pair of [[function]]s $V_1 \to V_2$ and $H_1 \to H_2$ commuting with the $i$- and $s$-maps.

=--

An edge is a *loop* if its constituent half-edges are incident on the same vertex. 

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A **fat graph** or **ribbon graph** is a graph $(V,H,i,s)$ equipped with a [[bijection]] $\sigma : H \to H$ whose [[cycle]]s correspond to the sets $s^{-1}(v)$ of half-edges incident on vertices $v \in V$. 

=--

This style of definition apparently goes back to ([Igusa 02](#Igusa02)).

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

This means that on all sets $s^{-1}(v)$ of jointly incident half-edges there is induced a cyclic ordering.

When drawing ribbon graphs on paper this cyclic ordering is identified with the ordering induced from the standard orientation of the plane.

=--



### Boundary of a fat graph

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Write 

$$
  \partial : FatGraph \to Graph
$$

for the [[functor]] -- called the **boundary graph functor** -- that sends a fat graph $\Gamma = (V, H, s, i, \sigma)$ to the graph

$$
  \partial \Gamma = \left(
     \coprod_{v \in V} \coprod_{h \in s^{-1}(v)} \{v_h\},\,
     \coprod_{h \in H} \{h_0, h_1\},\,
     s_{\partial_\Gamma},\,
     i_{\partial_\Gamma}
  \right)
$$

with $s_{\partial \Gamma}$ given by 

$$
  s_{\partial \Gamma}(h_0) = v_h
$$

$$
  s_{\partial \Gamma}(h_1) = \sigma(v_h)
$$

and $i_{\partial \Gamma}$ given by

$$
  i_{\partial \Gamma}(h_0) = i(h)_1
$$

$$
  i_{\partial \Gamma}(h_1) = i(h)_0
  \,.
$$


=--

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The set of [[boundary]] components of $\Sigma_\Gamma$ is naturally identified with the [[cycle]]s of $\sigma \circ i : H \to H$, or equivalently with the cycles of $i \circ \sigma$.

=--

Write $S : FatGraph \to Graph$ for the evident [[forgetful functor]] sending fat graphs to their underlying graph.

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition/Definition

There is a [[natural transformation]]

$$
  c : \partial \to S
$$

from the boundary graph functor to the forgetful functor -- called the **collapse map**, whose components morphism on a fat graph $\Gamma$ sends on vertices

$$
  v_h \mapsto s(h)
$$

and on half-edges

$$
  h_{0,1} \mapsto h
  \,.
$$

=--


### Further constructions

Given any edge $e$ in a graph $\Gamma$, 
we can collapse it to a new graph $\Gamma/e$ by merging the two vertices
containing the edge and removing both half edges.  

A forest $F$ (disjoint union of trees) spans a graph $\Gamma$ if it contains all of its vertices. One can collapse $\Gamma$ to $\Gamma/F$ by collapsing each tree to a separate vertex. Then the edges in $\Gamma/F$ are the edges of $\Gamma$ which do not lie in any tree in $F$; the vertices of $\Gamma/F$ correspond to the sets of leaves of the component trees of $F$.  

A morphism of graphs $\Gamma_0\to\Gamma_1$ is defined as an isomorphism $\Gamma_0/F\to\Gamma_1$ where $F$ is a spanning forest of $\Gamma_0$. Morphisms of such graphs are both epi and mono. 

For  a ribbon graph, the set of leaves of any tree inherits a cyclic order. Thus $\Gamma/F$ has a canonical structure a ribbon graph. This makes the following definition possible: A morphism of ribbon graphs is the morphism of underlying graphs which respects the ordering on the vertices; i.e.  $\Gamma_0/F\to\Gamma_1$ is an isomorphism of ribbon graphs. Every endomorphism of a ribbon graph is an automorphism and for any two ribbon graphs $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma'$, the set $Aut(\Gamma)$ acts freely on $Hom(\Gamma,\Gamma')$ on the right and $Aut(\Gamma')$ acts freely on $Hom(\Gamma,\Gamma')$ from the left. 

Let $\mathcal{Fat}$ denote the category of ribbon graphs and ribbon automorphisms. Strebel proved that the geometric realization $|\mathcal{Fat}|$ of the category of ribbon graphs decomposes into a direct sum of classifying spaces of all [[mapping class group]]s $M^s_g$ 

$$
|\mathcal{Fat}| = \coprod_{g,s} BM^s_g
$$

$M^s_g$ is a mapping class group of a surface of genus $g$ with $s$ punctures. Alternatively, one can instead of the geometric realization take a moduli space of ribbon graphs with metric. A **metric** on a ribbon graph is a positive real valued function on the set of edges. 


## Properties

For the following we represent a fat graph by

* a set $V$ of vertices;

* a set $H$ of half-edges;

* a source map $s : H \to V$;

* an involution $i :  H \to H$ which sends each half-edge to its partner half-edge;

* an permutation $\sigma : H \to H$ which gives the cyclic order on the edges.


### Geometric realization

For $\Gamma$ a fat graph, write $\Sigma_\Gamma$ for the [[surface]] that it defines.



+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The [[genus]] of $\Sigma_\Gamma$ is

$$
  g = \frac{1}{2}
   \left(
     - \vert V\vert - \vert E\vert - \vert bounary components\vert + 2
   \right)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

For every surface $S$ with boundary, there is a fat graph $\Gamma$ and a [[homeomorphism]]

$$
  S \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}  \Sigma_\Gamma
  \,.
$$

=--

### Moduli space of surfaces / classifying spaces of mapping class groups

Write $FatGraph^c_3$ for the [[full subcategory]] of fat graphs on the connected fat graphs for which every vertex has valence at leat 3. Write $\vert FatGraph^c_3 \vert \in $ [[Top]] for the [[geometric realization]] of this [[category]]. For $\Sigma$ a [[surface]], write $\Gamma_Sigma$ for its [[mapping class group]] and $B \Gamma_\Sigma$ for the corresponding [[classifying space]].

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

There is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]]

$$
  \vert FatGraph^c_3 \vert \simeq
  \coprod_{[\Sigma]} B \Gamma_\Sigma
  \,,
$$

where on the right thr coproduct ranges over isomorphism classes of orientable, closed 2-dimensional manifolds with $n \geq 1$ marked points, except those for which $(g,n) = (0,1)$ or  $(g, n) = (0,2)$.

=--

In various guises this theorem has been proven by [Costello](#Costello), [Kontsevich92](#Kontsevich92), [Igusa02](#Igusa02), [Penner](#Penner), [Strebel](#Strebel).

The restriction to valence $\geq 3$ can be dropped:

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

There is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]]

$$
  \vert FatGraph^c \vert \simeq
  B U(1) \coprod B U(1) \coprod_{[\Sigma]} B \Gamma_\Sigma
  \,,
$$

where again on the right the [[coproduct]] ranges over [[isomorphism class]]es of orientable, closed 2-dimensional manifolds with $n \geq 1$ marked points, except those for which $(g,n) = (0,1)$ or  $(g, n) = (0,2)$. The two extra copies of $B U(1)$ corespond to these two exceptional cases.

=--

This has been shown in ([Godin](#Godin)). One of the $B U(1)$-summands is also produced in ([Igusa02](#Igusa02)). A detailed complete proof appears as ([Kupers, theorem 3.59](#Kupers)).
