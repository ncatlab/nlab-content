## Definition

A **locally partially ordered category** is a [[category]] together with [[partial order]]ing $\subseteq$ on each of its [[hom-set]] such that
$$ f_1 \subseteq f_2 \;\wedge\; g_1 \subseteq g_2 \;\Rightarrow\; g_1 \circ f_1 \subseteq g_2 \circ f_2 $$
for any morphisms $f_1$, $g_1$, $f_2$, $g_2$ such that the composites above are defined.

>[[VictorPorton|Victor]]: I changed the earlier notion of partial ordered category where I was requiring partial order on the entire set of morphisms.

[[David Roberts]]: It makes no difference as long as the objects form a set, as $Pos$ has small coproducts, and so one can take what is defined above and form the disjoint union of the homsets, and even put the discrete partial order on the objects to get an internal category in $Pos$.

Compare this to the notion of category [[internal category|internal]] to the category [[Pos]] of [[poset]]s. 

+--{: .query}
[[Sridhar Ramesh]]: Is there meant to also be a partial ordering on the objects in addition to those on the Hom-sets? (Without this, I cannot make sense of the source and target maps preserving the partial order. Indeed, as it stands, I don't see how this definition is any different from that of a locally partially ordered category.)

[[David Roberts]]: I agree: the first definition is of a category enriched in [[Pos]], whereas the reference to source and target maps clearly talks about an internal category. I've edited it.
=--

Similarly, such a partially ordered category can be considered as a special kind of [[double category]], while a locally partially ordered category can be considered as a special kind of $2$-[[2-category|category]].

## Partially ordered $\dagger$-categories ##

For a partially ordered $\dagger$-[[dagger-category|(pre)category]] I will additionally require 

> [[Urs Schreiber]]: you should say who the "I" is who is speaking here

(for any morphisms $f$ and $g$) that 

\[ 
  f^{\dagger} \subseteq g^{\dagger} \Leftrightarrow f \subseteq g
  \,. 
\]

For a partially ordered $\dagger$-category I will call _monovalued_ morphism such a morphism $f$ that $f \circ f^{\dagger} \subseteq 1_{\mathrm{Dst} f}$.

For a partially ordered category with inverses I will call _entirely defined morphism_ such a morphism $f$ that $f^{\dagger} \circ f \supseteq
1_{\mathrm{Src} f}$.




## Partially ordered groupoids

The particular case of an ordered groupoid (in which each $f^{-1}$ is the inverse of $f$) is called an ordered groupoid.  This has been studied extensively by Mark Lawson, for instance see

* Lawson, Mark V _Constructing ordered groupoids_ Cahiers de Topologie et Géométrie Différentielle Catégoriques, 46 no. 2 (2005), p. 123-138,
([numdam](http://www.numdam.org/item?id=CTGDC_2005__46_2_123_0))

or his book: 

* M.V. Lawson, _Inverse semigroups: the theory of partial symmetries_ , World Scientific, 1998. 

He makes the point that they were initially studied by Ehresmann and are very closely related to inverse semi-groups.
