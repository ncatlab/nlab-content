## Definition

A **partially ordered category** is a [[category]] together with [[partial order]]ing $\subseteq$ on each of its [[hom-set]] such that
$$ f_1 \subseteq f_2 \;\wedge\; g_1 \subseteq g_2 \;\Rightarrow\; g_1 \circ f_1 \subseteq g_2 \circ f_2 $$
for any morphisms $f_1$, $g_1$, $f_2$, $g_2$ such that the composites above are defined.

>[[VictorPorton|Victor]]: I changed the earlier notion of partial ordered category where I was requiring partial order on the entire set of morphisms.

Compare this to the notion of [[locally partially ordered category]].  A partially ordered category in which the [[source]] and [[target]] maps preserve the partial order is a category *[[internal category|internal]] to* the category [[Pos]] of [[poset]]s, while a locally partially ordered category is a category *[[enriched category|enriched]] over* $Pos$.  

Similarly, such a partially ordered category is a special kind of [[double category]], while a locally partially ordered category is a special kind of $2$-[[2-category|category]].

## Partially ordered dagger categories ##

For a partially ordered [[dagger-category|dagger (pre)category]] I will additionally require 

> [[Urs Schreiber]]: you should say who the "I" is who is speaking here

(for any morphisms $f$ and $g$) that 

\[ 
  f^{\dagger} \subseteq g^{\dagger} \Leftrightarrow f \subseteq g
  \,. 
\]

For a partially ordered dagger category I will call _monovalued_ morphism such a morphism $f$ that $f \circ f^{\dagger} \subseteq 1_{\mathrm{Dst} f}$.

For a partially ordered category with inverses I will call _entirely defined morphism_ such a morphism $f$ that $f^{\dagger} \circ f \supseteq
1_{\mathrm{Src} f}$.

## Partially ordered groupoids

The particular case of an ordered groupoid (in which each $f^{-1}$ is the inverse of $f$) is called an ordered groupoid.  This has been studied extensively by Mark Lawson, for instance see

* Lawson, Mark V _Constructing ordered groupoids_ Cahiers de Topologie et Géométrie Différentielle Catégoriques, 46 no. 2 (2005), p. 123-138,
([numdam](http://www.numdam.org/item?id=CTGDC_2005__46_2_123_0))

or his book: 

* M.V. Lawson, _Inverse semigroups: the theory of partial symmetries_ , World Scientific, 1998. 

He makes the point that they were initially studied by Ehresmann and are very closely related to inverse semi-groups.
