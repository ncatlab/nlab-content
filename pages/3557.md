A __tripos__ is a [[first-order hyperdoctrine|first-order hyperdoctrine with equality]]  satisfying an additional property which is sufficient (but, at least in the original definition by Andrew Pitts, more than necessary) to allow it to interpret impredicative higher-order logic as well (in particular, every tripos gives rise to a corresponding [[topos]]). The additional property is particularly easy to state for hyperdoctrines whose category of terms $C_T$ is cartesian closed: such a hyperdoctrine is a tripos just in case it possesses a suitably generic predicate, in the sense that there is a natural transformation from a representable functor $Hom_{C_T}(-, X)$ to $|P(-)|$ (the "set of predicates on -" functor), all of whose components are surjections. Note that this notion of "suitably generic predicate" doesn't require $|P(-)|$ to actually be representable, but, rather, merely a "quotient"  of a representable functor.

By reconstructing from a tripos all the [[subquotient]]s it can "see" of its given sorts and all the functions it can "see" between them (i.e., moving to its [[category of partial equivalence relations]]), one obtains an elementary topos.
