## Idea

Given a [[separable Hilbert space]] $\mathcal{H}$, such as the [[sequence space]] $\mathcal{l}_2$, write $B(\mathcal{H})$ for its [[C*-algebra]] of [[bounded linear operators]] and $D(\mathcal{H})$ for the subalgebra of diagonal operators.

The _Kadison-Singer problem_ is the question:

_Does every [[pure state]] $\psi$ on $D(\mathcal{H})$ [[extension|extend]] to a [[state]] $\rho$ on $B(\mathcal{H})$?_



$$
  \array{
     D(\mathcal{H}) &\overset{\psi}{\longrightarrow}& \mathbb{C}
     \\
     \downarrow  & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\exists \rho}}
     \\
     B(\mathcal{H}) 
  }
$$

This was proven to be the case in [Marcus-Spielman-Srivastava 13](#MarcusSpielmanSrivastava13).
