## Idea

In [[perturbation theory]] (in [[QFT]]) a _tachyon_ is an excitation/[[particle]] with _negative [[mass]] squared_, hence technically with [[imaginary number|imaginary]] mass.

Since the masses of particles in [[perturbation theory]] give the second derivative of the background potential energy at the point about which the [[perturbation series]] is developed, a tachyon in the spectrum indicates that the [[perturbation theory]] is set up about an _unstable_ [[vacuum]].

## Examples

### In bosonic string theory

The excitation of the [[open string]] in [[bosonic string theory]] famously contains a tachyon mode. By [[Sen's conjecture]] this indicates the instability of the space-filling [[D25-brane]] on which the ends of the open bosonic string propagate. Using [[string field theory]] to get a [[non-perturbative field theory|non-perturbative]] description of the situation one can follow the decay of the [[D25-brane]] to the "true" (stable) [[bosonic string theory]] [[vacuum]]. See at _[[Sen's conjecture]]_ for more.

### In superstring theory

Similarly in [[superstring theory]] [[open string]] states between [[brane]]/[[anti-brane]] pairs can be tachyonic, signallying the decay of these brane configurations.
