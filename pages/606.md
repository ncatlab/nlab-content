## Idea

The *simplicial identities* encode the relationships between the face and degeneracy maps in a [[simplicial object]], in particular, in a [[simplicial set]].

## Definition

The **simplicial identities** are the duals to the _simplicial relations_  of coface and codegeneracy maps described at [[simplex category]]:

Let $S \in $ [[sSet]] with

* face maps  $d_i : S_n \to S_{n-1}$ obtained by omitting the $i$th vertex;

* degeneracy maps $s_i : S_n \to S_{n+1}$ obtained by repeating the $i$th vertex.

###### Definition

The **simplicial identities** satisfied by face and degeneracy maps as above are (whenever these maps are composable as indicated):

1. $ d_i \circ d_j  = d_{j-1} \circ d_i$ if $i \lt j$,

1. $s_i \circ s_j  = s_j \circ s_{i-1}$ if $i \gt j$.

1. $d_i \circ s_j =  \left\{ \array{ s_{j-1} \circ d_i &  if \;  i \lt j \\ id & if  \;  i = j \; or \; i = j+1 \\ s_j \circ d_{i-1} &  if i \gt j+1 } \right. $

## Properties

### Relation to nilpotency of differentials
 {#RelationToNilpotencyOfDifferentials}

The simplicial identities of def. \ref{SimplicialIdentities} can be understood as a non-abelian or "unstable" generalization of the identity

$$
  \partial \circ \partial = 0
$$

satisfied by [[differentials]] in [[chain complexes]] (in [[homological algebra]]). 

Write $\mathbb{Z}[S]$ be the [[simplicial abelian group]] obtained form $S$ by forming degreewise the [[free abelian group]] on the set of $n$-simplices, as discussed at _[[chains on a simplicial set]]_.

Then using these [[formal linear combinations]] we can sum up all the $(n+1)$ face maps $d_i : S_n \to S_{n-1}$ into a single map:

+-- {: .num_defn #TheAlternatingFaceMapDifferential}
###### Definition

The **alternating face map differential** in degree $n$ of the simplicial set $S$ 
is the linear map 

$$
  \partial : \mathbb{Z}[S_n] \to \mathbb{Z}[S_{n-1}]
$$ 

defined on [[basis]] elements $\sigma \in S_n$ to be the alternating sum of the simplicial face maps:

\[
  \label{AlternatingFaceMapDifferential}
  \partial \sigma \coloneqq \sum_{k = 0}^n (-1)^k d_i \sigma
  \,.
\]

=--

This is the [[differential]] of the _[[alternating face map complex]]_ of $S$:

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

The simplicial identity def. \ref{SimplicialIdentities} (1) implies that def. \ref{TheAlternatingFaceMapDifferential} indeed defines a [[differential]] in that $\partial \circ \partial = 0$.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By linearity, it is sufficient to check this on a basis element $\sigma \in S_n$. There we compute as follows:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \partial \partial \sigma
    & = 
    \partial \left(
      \sum_{j = 0}^n (-1)^j d_j \sigma
    \right)
    \\
    & =
    \sum_{j=0}^n \sum_{i = 0}^{n-1} (-1)^{i+j} d_i d_j \sigma
    \\
     & =
     \sum_{0 \leq i \lt j \leq n} (-1)^{i+j} d_i d_j \sigma
     + 
     \sum_{0 \leq j \leq i \lt n} (-1)^{i + j} d_i d_j \sigma
     \\
     & = 
     \sum_{0 \leq i \lt j \leq n} (-1)^{i+j} d_{j-1} d_i \sigma
     + 
     \sum_{0 \leq j \leq i \lt n} (-1)^{i + j} d_i d_j \sigma
     \\
     & = 
     - 
     \sum_{0 \leq i \leq j \lt n} (-1)^{i+j} d_{j} d_i \sigma
     + 
     \sum_{0 \leq j \leq i \lt n} (-1)^{i + j} d_i d_j \sigma
     \\
     & = 0
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

Here 

1. the first equality is (eq:AlternatingFaceMapDifferential);

1. the second is (eq:AlternatingFaceMapDifferential) together with the linearity of $d$;

1. the third is obtained by decomposing the sum into two summands;

1. the fourth finally uses the simplicial identity def. \ref{SimplicialIdentities} (1) in the first summand;

1. the fifth relabels the summation index $j$ by $j +1$;

1. the last one observes that the resulting two summands are negatives of each other.
