## Idea

A **finiteness space** is a [[set]] together with a collection of its subsets that behave, in certain ways, like the collection of finite subsets.

## Definition

Given a set $X$ and a subset $\mathcal{U} \subseteq P(X)$ of its [[power set]], define 

$$\mathcal{U}^\perp = \{ v \in P(X) \mid u \cap v \;\text{ is finite for all }\; u\in \mathcal{U} \}.$$

This defines a [[Galois connection]] on $P(X)$.

###### Definition
A **finiteness space** is a set $X$ equipped with a $\mathcal{U} \subseteq P(X)$ such that $\mathcal{U} = \mathcal{U}^{\perp\perp}$.
=--

We refer to the elements of $\mathcal{U}$ as **finitary**, and the elements of $\mathcal{U}^\perp$ as **cofinitary**.  Note that all finite subsets of $X$ belong to $\mathcal{U}^\perp$ for any $\mathcal{U}$.  Thus, in a finiteness space all finite subsets are finitary.

## Examples

* Taking $\mathcal{U} =$ all finite subsets of $X$ gives a **minimal** finiteness structure on $X$.

* Dually, taking $\mathcal{U}=$ all subsets of $X$ gives a **maximal** finiteness structure.

* In fact, if $(X,\mathcal{U})$ is a finiteness space, so is $(X,\mathcal{U}^\perp)$, its **dual**.  The maximal and minimal finiteness structures are dual.

* Let $X$ be a [[poset]] and $\mathcal{U}$ the set of all subsets of $X$ that are *noetherian*, i.e. contain no infinite strictly increasing chains.  Then this is a finiteness space.  Its dual (at least, assuming the [[axiom of choice]]) consists of subsets that are *artinian* (contain no infinite strictly decreasing chains) and *narrow* (contain no infinite [[antichains]]).

* Let $X$ be a [[linearly ordered set]] and let $\mathcal{U}$ the set of all *left-finite* subsets, i.e. those $u$ such that $u\cap \{ x \mid x \le y\}$ is finite for all $y$.  Since this is of the form $\mathcal{V}^\perp$ for $\mathcal{V}$ the set of subsets $\{x \mid x\le y\}$, it is a finiteness structure.

## Morphisms

A **relation** or **morphism** of finiteness spaces is a [[relation]] $R$ from $X$ to $Y$ such that

1. If $u\subseteq X$ is finitary, then $u\circ R = \{ y\in Y \mid \exists x\in u, x R y \}$ is finitary.
2. If $v\subseteq Y$ is cofinitary, then $R\circ v = \{ x\in X \mid \exists y\in v, x R y \}$ is cofinitary.

An equivalent way to say this is that

* If $u\subseteq X$ is finitary and $v\subseteq Y$ is cofinitary, then the set $\{ (x,y) \mid x\in u \wedge y\in v \wedge x R y \} \subseteq X \times Y$ has finite images under both projections $X\times Y\to X$ and $X\times Y\to Y$.

Let $FinSp_{rel}$ denote the category of finiteness spaces and relations, and $FinSp_{par}$ and $FinSp_{fun}$ its [[wide subcategories]] in which the morphisms are restricted to be [[partial functions]] or [[functions]], respectively.  (Note that a partial function lies in $FinSp_{par}$ if and only if the preimage of any cofinitary subset is cofinitary.)  Then:

* All three categories are [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal]] and the inclusions $FinSp_{fun} \hookrightarrow FinSp_{par} \hookrightarrow FinSp_{rel}$ are strict symmetric monoidal.
* $FinSp_{rel}$ is [[star-autonomous]] (see [Ehrhard](#Ehrhard05)).
* $FinSp_{par}$ is [[closed monoidal category|closed]], [[complete category|complete]], and [[cocomplete category|cocomplete]] (see [BCJS](#BCJS18)).

## Linearization

Let $(X,\mathcal{U})$ be a finiteness space and $A$ an [[abelian group]], and define

$$ A \langle X\rangle = \{ f : X\to A \mid supp(f) \in \mathcal{U} \}$$

where $supp(f) = \{ x\in X \mid f(x)\neq 0 \}$ is the [[support]] of $f$.  Then $A\langle X\rangle$ is an abelian group called the **linearization** of $X$.

It is shown in [BCJS](#BCJS18) that if $X$ is a partial finiteness monoid (i.e. a monoid in $FinSp_{par}$) and $R$ a [[ring]], then $R\langle X\rangle$ is also a ring with

$$ (f\cdot g)(m) = \sum_{(m_1,m_2)\in X_m(f,g)} f(m_1)\cdot g(m_2) $$

where $X_m(f,g)$ is the set of pairs $(m_1,m_2)\in supp(f) \times supp(g)$ such that $m_1 \cdot m_2 = m$.

### Examples

* Any monoid (or partial monoid) is a finiteness monoid with the minimal finiteness structure.  The linearization $R\langle X\rangle$ is then the free $R$-module generated by the set $X$.

* If $X$ is a poset whose finitary subsets are the artinian and narrow ones, and whose multiplication preserves the strict order on each side, then it is a finitenes monoid, and its linearization is the ring of [[Ribenboim power series]] from $X$ with coefficients in $R$ (see [BCJS](#BCJS18)).  Thus, this includes rings of [[formal power series]], [[formal Laurent series]], [[polynomials]], [[Laurent polynomials]], and [[Hahn series]].

* If $X$ is a linearly ordered abelian group and the finitary subsets are the left-finite ones, then its linearization is the corresponding [[Novikov field]].

* As shown in [BCJS](#BCJS18), other examples include [[Puiseux series]], formal power series over a free monoid, and polynomials of bounded degree.
