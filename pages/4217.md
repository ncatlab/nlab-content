In [[logic]], logical disjunction is the [[join]] in the [[poset]] of [[truth values]].

Assuming that (as in [[classical logic]]) the only truth values are true ($T$) and false ($F$), then the disjunction $p \vee q$ of the truth values $p$ and $q$ may be defined by a truth table:

|$p$|$q$| |$p \vee q$|
|---|---|-|------------|
|$T$|$T$| |$T$|
|$T$|$F$| |$T$|
|$F$|$T$| |$T$|
|$F$|$F$| |$T$|

That is, $p \wedge q$ is true if and only if at least one of $p$ and $q$ is true.  Disjunction also exists in nearly every non-classical logic.

More generally, if $p$ and $q$ are any two [[relations]] on the same domain, then we define their disjunction pointwise, thinking of a relation as a [[function]] to truth values.  If instead we think of a relation as a [[subset]] of its domain, then disjunction becomes [[union]].

Disjunction as defined above is sometimes called __inclusive disjunction__ to distinguish it from [[exclusive disjunction]], where *exactly* one of $p$ and $q$ must be true.

Like any join, disjunction is an associative operation, so we can take the disjunction of any finite positive whole number of truth values; the disjunction is true if and only if at least one of the various truth values is true.  Disjunction also has an [[identity element]], which is the [[falsity|false]] truth value.  Some logics allow a notion of infinitary disjunction.  Indexed disjunction is [[existential quantification]].
