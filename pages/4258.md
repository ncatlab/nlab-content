**Joel W. Robbin** is a mathematician at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. His thesis was in mathematical logics, under A. Church of Princeton; he also authored a textbook on logics and coauthored _Mathematical logic and computability_ with [Jerome Kiestler](http://www.math.wisc.edu/~keisler). 

From soon after his thesis, Robbin switches his main interests to [[dynamical systems]] of Morse-Smale type where he found several foundational results. He also worked in related questions of rigorous approaches to [[quantization]], [[symplectic geometry]] and [[symplectic topology]]; several of his articles are coauthored with [[Dietmar Salamon]]. 

At the time when MatLab was expensive for students, Robbin programmed an interpreter for a small subset MINI MatLab free for student's use and accompanying his undergraduate textbook on algebra; more recently he translated that subset to a java version.
