## Idea

### General

The [[KK-compactification|KK]] [[flux compactification]] of [[M-theory]]/[[F-theory]] on an [[elliptic fibration|elliptically fibered]] [[Calabi-Yau variety]] of ([[complex manifold|complex]]) [[dimension]] 4 (hence real dimension 8) yields [[type IIB superstring theory]] (with some [[S-duality]]-related [[non-perturbative effects]] included) [[KK-compactification|KK-compactified]] on Calabi-Yau 3-folds.


### Motivation from string model building/phenomenology

By the discussion at _[[supersymmetry and Calabi-Yau manifolds]]_ such compactifications of [[type IIB superstring theory]] yield the [[UV-completion]] of an [[effective field theory]] in 4-dimensions which exhibits $N =1 $ [[supersymmetry]].
For this reason F/M-theory compactifications on elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau 4-folds are a major contender in [[string phenomenology]] [[model (physics)|model]] building. See at _[string phenomenology -- Models in type II / F-theory](string+phenomenology#ModelsInTypeIIWithIntersectingBranes)_ for more on this.

### Motivation from mathematics

At the same time these types of [[F-theory]] [[KK-compactifications]] are of interest also for their pure [[mathematics]] and as such received a fair amount of attention notably in [[algebraic geometry]].

For instance the [[duality between F-theory and heterotic string theory]] translates into a class of rich equivalences of [[moduli spaces]] of bundles on different [[algebraic varieties]] which is rather non-obvious without the [[string theory]]-perspective. 

From the abstract of ([Donagi 98](#Donagi98)).

> The [[heterotic string theory|heterotic string]] [[KK-compactification|compactified]] on an $(n-1)$-[[dimension|dimensional]] [[elliptic fibration|elliptically fibered]] [[Calabi-Yau variety|Calabi-Yau]] $Z \to B$ is conjectured to be [[duality in string theory|dual]] to [[F-theory]] [[KK-compactification|compactified]] on an $n$-dimensional [[Calabi-Yau variety|Calabi-Yau]] $X \to B$, fibered over the same base with [[elliptic fibration|elliptic]] [[K3]] fibers. In particular, the [[moduli]] of the two theories should be [[isomorphism|isomorphic]]. The cases most relevant to the physics are $n=2$, $3$, $4$, i.e. the [[KK-compactification|compactification]] is to [[dimensions]] $d=8$, $6$ or $4$ respectively. Mathematically, the richest picture seems to emerge for $n=3$, where the [[moduli space]] involves an analytically [[integrable system]] whose fibers admit rather different descriptions in the two theories.

Moreover, the description of the [[supergravity C-field]] (in the physics literature: the "4-form flux", see at _[[flux compactification]]_), being (up to various twists and subtleties, see there) a [[cocycle]] in degree-4 [[ordinary differential cohomology]] on the [[Calabi-Yau variety]]  involves the [[moduli spaces of (higher) line bundles]] on the $CY_4$ which under decomposition of the C-field into various [[cup product in ordinary differential cohomology|cup-product]] factors associated with the various [[divisor (algebraic geometry)|divisor]] of the $CY_4$ involves [[intermediate Jacobians]] and [[Artin-Mazur formal groups]] in degrees 0,1,2 with rich theory.
