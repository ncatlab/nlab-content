## Definition

A [[topological space]] is called _countably compact_ if every [[open cover]] consisting of a [[countable set]] of [[open subsets]] (every [[countable cover]]) admits a [[finite cover|finite subcover]], hence if there is a [[finite set|finite]] [[subset]] of the open in the original cover which still cover the space.
