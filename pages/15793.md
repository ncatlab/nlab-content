## Idea

A type of [[fiber bundle]] (usually: [[vector bundle]]) over ([[smooth manifold|smooth]]) [[manifolds]] is called _natural_ if suitable homomorphisms of manifolds naturally lift to morphisms of the corresponding bundles covering them.

The archetypical example is the [[tangent bundle]] $T X$ of a manifold $X$. For $f \colon X \to Y$ any [[smooth function]] then push-forward of vector fields yields a fiberwise linear morphism $d f \colon T X \to T Y$ of tangent bundles which covers $f$, in that the [[diagram]]

$$
  \array{
    T X &\stackrel{d f}{\longrightarrow}& T Y
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow 
    \\
    X &\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}& Y
  }
$$

[[commuting diagram|commutes]]. (This funcotriality of the tangent bundle construciton is incidentally also the incarnation of the [[chain rule]] (see there) of [[differentiation]]).

Formally, there is a [[category]] of fiber bundles over manifolds with [[morphisms]] the morphisms of bundles covering morphisms of the base spaces, and there is a [[forgetful functor]] from that to the category of manifolds. A natural bundle is a [[section]] of this forgetful functor.

Also "contravariantly natural" bundles such as bundle of [[covectors]] are sometimes referred to as natural bundles (e.g. [Kolar-Michor-Slovak](#KolarMichorSlovak)). But these are covariantly natural not with respect to all smooth functions between manifolds, but only for [[local diffeomorphisms]].
