There are many [[model category]] structures on the category of [[simplicial presheaf|simplicial presheaves]] derived from the [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]]. The extremal cases are 

* the  **global projective** model structure (weak equivalences and fibrations are objectwise those of simplicial sets);

* the **global injective** (weak equivalences and cofibrations are objectwise those of SimpSet).

These two model structures are Quillen equivalent (_DHI04_ [p. 5](http://www.math.uiuc.edu/K-theory/0563/spre.pdf#page=5) with the Quillen equivalence given by the identity functor). 

From these one gets local projective and injective model structures by [[Bousfield localization]].

* the  **local projective** model structure (weak equivalences are locally (usually stalkwise) and fibrations are objectwise those of simplicial sets);

* the **local injective** (weak equivalences are locally (usually stalkwise) and cofibrations are objectwise those of SimpSet).


In between these two structures there are many other model structures obtained by varying the class of generating global cofibrations.

The _local injective_ model structure on simplicial presheaves models  [[infinity-stack homotopically|infinity-stacks]]. This is due to Jardine, following the construction of the the Quillen equivalent local [[model structure on simplicial sheaves]] by Joyal.

In the following let $S$ be a small [[site]] and denote by $SimpPr(S)$ be the category of [[simplicial presheaf|simplicial presheaves]] on $S$.


#Local or injective model structures#

One usually says that a **local model structure** on a category of [[presheaf|presheaves]] is one whose weak equivalences are not defined objectwise but on [[cover]]s and/or on stalks.

##Local weak equivalences##

(see section 2 of _Jardine07_)

We want to say that a local weak equivalence of simplicial presheaves is one which is "over each point" an isomorphism of homotopy groups.

we need the following terminology about sheaves of simplicial homtopy groups:

* for $X$ a [[simplicial set]], write $\pi_0(X)$ for its set of connected components and $\pi_n(X,x)$, $n \geq 1$, $x \in X_0$, for its $n$th simplicial homotopy group at $x$ (the homotopy group of its [[geometric realization]]), $\pi_n(X,x) = \pi_n(|X|, x)$. This yields functors 
$\pi_0 : SimpSet \to Set$ and $\pi_n : SimpSet \to Grps$.

* By postcomposition these functors induce functors
$
  \pi_0 : SimpSet^{S^{op}} \to Set^{S^{op}}
$
and
$
  \pi_n : SimpSet^{S^{op}} \to Grps^{S^{op}}
$. 

* By postcomposition with the sheafification functor this yields functors
$
  \tilde \pi_0 : SimpSet^{S^{op}} \to Sh(S)
$
and
$
  \tilde \pi_n : SimpSet^{S^{op}} \to Sh(S,Grps)
$.

###### Definition

A **local weak equivalence** of simplicial presheaves is a morphism $f : X \to Y$ such that 

1. the morphism $\tilde \pi_0(f) : \tilde \pi_0 X \to \tilde \pi_0 Y$ is an isomorphism in $Sh(S)$;

2. the diagrams
$$
  \array{
     \tilde \pi_n X &\to& \tilde \pi_n Y
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow 
     \\
     \tilde \pi_0 X
     &\to&
     \tilde \pi_0 Y
  }
$$
are pullback diagram in $Sh(S,SimpSet)$, for all $n \geq 1$.

### Examples ###

* Every object-wise weak equivalence is in particular a local weak equivalence.


If the site $S$ _has enough points_ then the above condition is equivalent to saying that $f$ is a weak equivalence in the [[model structure on simplicial sets]] over every stalk (see [p. 363](http://www.intlpress.com/HHA/v3/n2/a5/v3n2a5.pdf#page=3) of _Jardine01_).

### Equivalent reformulation ###

A morphism $f : X \to Y$ of simplicial presheaves is, equivalently, a local weak equivalence if all induced morphisms of sheaves 
$$
  \tilde \pi_n (X|_U, x) \to \tilde \pi_n Y|_U, f(x)
$$
are isomorphisms for all $U \in S$, for $X|_U, Y|_U$ the pullbacks to the over-category site $S/U$, for all $x \in X_0(U)$ and all $n \geq 0$.


## Local injective model structure ##

+-- {: .un_theorem }
###### Theorem 

There is a proper closed [[enriched category|simplicially enriched]] [[model category]] structure on $SimpPr(S)$ such that

* cofibrations are precisely the objectwise cofibrations of simplicial sets, i.e. the monomorphisms in $SimpPr(S)$;

* weak equivalences are the _local weak equivalences_ from above.

###### Theorem 

The inclusion of sheaves into simplicial presheaves
$SimpSh(S) \hookrightarrow SimpPr(S)$ and the sheafification functor 
$SimpPr(S) \to SimpSh(S)$ constitute a 
[[Quillen equivalence]] with respect to the above
_first local model structure_ on $SimpPr(S)$ ans the local 
[[model structure on simplicial sheaves]].

See _Jardine07_, theorem 5.


+-- {: .un_theorem }
###### Theorem 

The fibrant objects with respect to the injective model structure are precisely the [[infinity-stack]]s on $S$ which are globally Kan-complexes.

More precisely, the fibrant objects are precisely those presheaves $P$ such that

1. for all test domains $U \in S$ the simplicial set $P(U)$ is a [[Kan complex]].

2. $P$ satisfies [[descent and codescent|descent]] for all [[hypercover]]s $\pi : Y \to X$
$$
  P(X) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} Desc(Y,P)
  \,.
$$
=--

Here a hypercover is a _local_ acyclic fibration, i.e. such that for every test domain $U$ and every commuting diagram
$$
  \array{
    \partial \Delta^n
    &\to&
    Y(U)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \Delta^n &\to& X(U)
  }
$$
there exists a [[cover]] $V \to U$ such that the diagram pulled back to $V$ has a lift
$$
  \array{
    \partial \Delta^n
    &\to&
    Y(V)
    \\
    \downarrow &\nearrow& \downarrow
    \\
    \Delta^n &\to& X(V)
  }
  \,.
$$

This is proven in _DHI04_.


##Remarks##

* The _injective model structure_ provides a model for [[infinity-stack homotopically|infinity-stacks]], as described on [page 11](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/math/pdf/0604/0604504v3.pdf#page=11) of To&euml;n: _Higher and derived stacks: a global overview_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.AG/0604504))


#Intermediate model structures#

One can regard the projective and the injective model structure as two extrema of a poset of model structures on simplicial presheaves.
