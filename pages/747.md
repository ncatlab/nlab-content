There are many [[model category]] structures on the category of [[simplicial presheaf|simplicial presheaves]] derived from the [[model structure on simplicial sets]]. 

The _local_ such model structures are of interest in that they model [[infinity-stack homotopically|infinity-stacks]].

They can be thought of as being obtained from global model structures, of which there are two:

* the  **global projective** model structure has weak equivalences and fibrations being _objectwise_ those of [[simplicial set]]s;

* the  **global injective** model structure has weak equivalences and cofibrations being _objectwise_ those of [[simplicial set]]s;

These two model structures are Quillen equivalent 
( _DHI04_ [p. 5](http://www.math.uiuc.edu/K-theory/0563/spre.pdf#page=5) with the Quillen equivalence given by the identity functor). They can be defined on any domain category $S$, not necessarily a [[site]]. If we do have a structure of a [[site]] on $S$ then there is a  notion of _local weak equivalences_ of simplicial presheaves on $S$, defined below.
One gets _local_ projective and _local_ injective model structures by applying left [[Bousfield localization]] of the above model structures at local weak equivalences (see [p. 6](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/math/pdf/0205/0205027v2.pdf#page=6) of _DHI04_ )

* the  **local projective** model structure (weak equivalences are locally (usually stalkwise) and fibrations are objectwise those of simplicial sets);

* the **local injective** (weak equivalences are locally (usually stalkwise) and cofibrations are objectwise those of SimpSet).

Again, these two model structures are Quillen equivalent by the identity functors between the underlying categories and hence provide projective and injective versions of the corresponding homotopy theory of [[infinity-stack homotopically|infinity-stacks]].

In the local injective structure all objects are cofibrant, so that the [[opposite category]] of simplicial presheaves with the local injective model structure is a [[category of fibrant objects]].

Both local model structures are proper [[enriched category|simplicially enriched]] categories (_DHI04_ [p. 5](http://www.math.uiuc.edu/K-theory/0563/spre.pdf#page=6)). 

The _local injective_ model structure on simplicial presheaves models is originally due to Jardine, following the construction of the the Quillen equivalent local [[model structure on simplicial sheaves]] by Joyal. It was only later realized in _DHI04_ as a left [[Bousfield localization]] of the global injective model structure.


In between the injective and the projective model structures there are many other model structures obtained by varying the class of generating global cofibrations.


In the following let $S$ be a small [[site]] and denote by $SimpPr(S)$ be the category of [[simplicial presheaf|simplicial presheaves]] on $S$.


#Local or injective model structures#

One usually says that a **local model structure** on a category of [[presheaf|presheaves]] is one whose weak equivalences are not defined objectwise but on [[cover]]s and/or on stalks.

##Local weak equivalences##

There are different equivalent ways to define local weak equivalences of simplicial presheaves on a site $S$.


###In terms of sheaves of homotopy groups###

(see section 2 of _Jardine07_)

We want to say that a local weak equivalence of simplicial presheaves is one which is "over each point" an isomorphism of homotopy groups.

we need the following terminology about sheaves of simplicial homtopy groups:

* for $X$ a [[simplicial set]], write $\pi_0(X)$ for its set of connected components and $\pi_n(X,x)$, $n \geq 1$, $x \in X_0$, for its $n$th simplicial homotopy group at $x$ (the homotopy group of its [[geometric realization]]), $\pi_n(X,x) = \pi_n(|X|, x)$. This yields functors 
$\pi_0 : SimpSet \to Set$ and $\pi_n : SimpSet \to Grps$.

* By postcomposition these functors induce functors
$
  \pi_0 : SimpSet^{S^{op}} \to Set^{S^{op}}
$
and
$
  \pi_n : SimpSet^{S^{op}} \to Grps^{S^{op}}
$. 

* By postcomposition with the sheafification functor this yields functors
$
  \tilde \pi_0 : SimpSet^{S^{op}} \to Sh(S)
$
and
$
  \tilde \pi_n : SimpSet^{S^{op}} \to Sh(S,Grps)
$.

###### Definition

A **local weak equivalence** of simplicial presheaves is a morphism $f : X \to Y$ such that 

1. the morphism $\tilde \pi_0(f) : \tilde \pi_0 X \to \tilde \pi_0 Y$ is an isomorphism in $Sh(S)$;

2. the diagrams
$$
  \array{
     \tilde \pi_n X &\to& \tilde \pi_n Y
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow 
     \\
     \tilde \pi_0 X
     &\to&
     \tilde \pi_0 Y
  }
$$
are pullback diagram in $Sh(S,SimpSet)$, for all $n \geq 1$.
=--

Equivbalently a morphism $f : X \to Y$ of simplicial presheaves is, equivalently, a local weak equivalence if all induced morphisms of sheaves 
$$
  \tilde \pi_n (X|_U, x) \to \tilde \pi_n Y|_U, f(x)
$$
are isomorphisms for all $U \in S$, for $X|_U, Y|_U$ the pullbacks to the over-category site $S/U$, for all $x \in X_0(U)$ and all $n \geq 0$.

If the site $S$ _has enough points_ then this condition is equivalent to saying that $f$ is a weak equivalence in the [[model structure on simplicial sets]] over every stalk (see [p. 363](http://www.intlpress.com/HHA/v3/n2/a5/v3n2a5.pdf#page=3) of _Jardine01_).



###In terms of local liftings###

(see _DI02_ )

Equivalently a local weak equivalence is a morphism $f : X \to Y$ such that for all commuting diagrams

$$
  \array{
    \Lambda^n[i] \otimes U &\to& X
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^f
    \\
    \Delta^n \otimes U &\to& Y
  }
$$
there is a lift after pulling back to some cover of $U$.

(...)


### Examples ###

* Every object-wise weak equivalence is in particular a local weak equivalence.


## Local injective model structure ##

+-- {: .un_theorem }
###### Theorem 

There is a proper closed [[enriched category|simplicially enriched]] [[model category]] structure on $SimpPr(S)$ such that

* cofibrations are precisely the objectwise cofibrations of simplicial sets, i.e. the monomorphisms in $SimpPr(S)$;

* weak equivalences are the _local weak equivalences_ from above.

###### Theorem 

The inclusion of sheaves into simplicial presheaves
$SimpSh(S) \hookrightarrow SimpPr(S)$ and the [[sheafification]] functor 
$SimpPr(S) \to SimpSh(S)$ constitute a 
[[Quillen equivalence]] with respect to the above
_local injective model structure_ on $SimpPr(S)$ ans the local [[model structure on simplicial sheaves]].

See _Jardine07_, theorem 5.


## Local projective model structure ##

(the local projective model structure is the 
left [[Bousfield localization]] with respect to local weak equivalence of the global projective model structure)


##Characterization of fibrations##

Fibrations in the local model structure are global fibrations that satisfy [[descent]].
Therefore the fibrant objects in the local model structure on simplicial presheaves are
globally fibrant [[infinity-stack]]s on $S$.


More precisely: 


+-- {: .un_theorem }
###### Theorem 

* Te fibrant objects in the local projective model structure are precisely those presheaves $P$ such that

  1. for all test domains $U \in S$ the simplicial set $P(U)$ is a [[Kan complex]].

  2. $P$ satisfies [[descent]] for all [[hypercover]]s $\pi : Y \to X$
$$
  P(X) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} Desc(Y,P)
  \,.
$$

* The fibrant objects in the local injective model structure are precisely those presheaves $P$ such that

  1. $P$ is a fibration with respect to the global injective model structure;

  2. $P$ satisfies [[descent]] for all [[hypercover]]s $\pi : Y \to X$
$$
  P(X) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} Desc(Y,P)
  \,.
$$

=--

Here a hypercover is a _local_ acyclic fibration, i.e. such that for every test domain $U$ and every commuting diagram
$$
  \array{
    \partial \Delta^n
    &\to&
    Y(U)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \Delta^n &\to& X(U)
  }
$$
there exists a [[cover]] $V \to U$ such that the diagram pulled back to $V$ has a lift
$$
  \array{
    \partial \Delta^n
    &\to&
    Y(V)
    \\
    \downarrow &\nearrow& \downarrow
    \\
    \Delta^n &\to& X(V)
  }
  \,.
$$

This is proven in _DHI04_, see corollary 7.1 on [p. 19](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/math/pdf/0205/0205027v2.pdf#page=19).

More generally, there is a notion of descent for morphisms of simplicial presheaves. 

+-- {: .un_theorem }
###### Theorem 

The fibrations in the local injective (projective) model structure on $SimpPr(S)$ are precisely the fibrations with respect to the global model structure which satisfy descent.

=--

This is in _DHI04_ theorem 7.8 on [p. 23](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/math/pdf/0205/0205027v2.pdf#page=19).


##Remarks##

* The _local model structures_ provides a model for [[infinity-stack homotopically|infinity-stacks]], as described on [page 11](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/math/pdf/0604/0604504v3.pdf#page=11) of To&euml;n: _Higher and derived stacks: a global overview_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.AG/0604504))


#Intermediate model structures#

One can regard the projective and the injective model structure as two extrema of a poset of model structures on simplicial presheaves.
