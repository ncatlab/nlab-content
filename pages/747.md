There are various [[model category]] structures on the category of [[simplicial presheaf|simplicial presheaves]].

Let $S$ be a small [[site]] and let $SimpPr(S)$ be the category of [[simplicial presheaf|simplicial presheaves]] on $S$.

#Global or projective model structure#

For many (..insert details...) categories of [[diagram]]s in a [[model category]] there is a model structure whose weak equivalences and fibrations are the levelwise/objectwise weak equivalences and fibrations. 


#Local model structures#

One usually says that a **local model structure** on a category of [[presheaf|presheaves]] is one whose weak equivalences are not defined objectwise but on [[cover]]s and/or on stalks.

##Local weak equivalences##

(see section 2 of _Jardine07_)

We want to say that a local weak equivalence of simplicial presheaves is one which is "over each point" an isomorphism of homotopy groups.

we need the following terminology about sheaves of simplicial homtopy groups:

* for $X$ a [[simplicial set]], write $\pi_0(X)$ for its set of connected components and $\pi_n(X,x)$, $n \geq 1$, $x \in X_0$, for its $n$th simplicial homotopy group at $x$ (the homotopy group of its [[geometric realization]]), $\pi_n(X,x) = \pi_n(|X|, x)$. This yields functors 
$\pi_0 : SimpSet \to Set$ and $\pi_n : SimpSet \to Grps$.

* By postcomposition these functors induce functors
$
  \pi_0 : SimpSet^{S^{op}} \to Set^{S^{op}}
$
and
$
  \pi_n : SimpSet^{S^{op}} \to Grps^{S^{op}}
$. 

* By postcomposition with the sheafification functor this yields functors
$
  \tilde \pi_0 : SimpSet^{S^{op}} \to Sh(S)
$
and
$
  \tilde \pi_n : SimpSet^{S^{op}} \to Sh(S,Grps)
$.

###### Definition

A **local weak equivalence** of simplicial presheaves is a morphism $f : X \to Y$ such that 

1. the morphism $\tilde \pi_0(f) : \tilde \pi_0 X \to \tilde \pi_0 Y$ is an isomorphism in $Sh(S)$;

2. the diagrams
$$
  \array{
     \tilde \pi_n X &\to& \tilde \pi_n Y
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow 
     \\
     \tilde \pi_0 X
     &\to&
     \tilde \pi_0 Y
  }
$$
are pullback diagram in $Sh(S,SimpSet)$, for all $n \geq 1$.

### Examples ###

* Every object-wise weak equivalence is in particular a local weak equivalence.

### Equivalent reformulation ###

A morphism $f : X \to Y$ of simplicial presheaves is, equivalently, a local weak equivalence if all induced morphisms of sheaves 
$$
  \tilde \pi_n (X|_U, x) \to \tilde \pi_n Y|_U, f(x)
$$
are isomorphisms for all $U \in S$, for $X|_U, Y|_U$ the pullbacks to the over-category site $S/U$, for all $x \in X_0(U)$ and all $n \geq 0$.


## First local model structure ##

+-- {: .un_theorem }
###### Theorem 

There is a proper closed [[enriched category|simplicially enriched]] [[model category]] structure on $SimpPr(S)$ such that

* cofibrations are precisely the monomorphisms in $SimpPr(S)$;

* weak equivalences are the _local weak equivalences_ from above.

###### Theorem 

The inclusion of sheaves into simplicial presheaves
$SimpSh(S) \hookrightarrow SimpPr(S)$ and the sheafification functor 
$SimpPr(S) \to SimpSh(S)$ constitute a 
[[Quillen equivalence]] with respect to the above
_first local model structure_ on $SimpPr(S)$ ans the local 
[[model structure on simplicial sheaves]].

See _Jardine07_, theorem 5.

###### Theorem 

The fibrant objects with respect to the first local model structure are the [[infinity-stack]]s on $S$ with values in [[Kan complex]]es.

##Remarks##

* The _first local model structure_ provides a model for [[infinity-stack homotopically|infinity-stacks]], as described on [page 11](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/math/pdf/0604/0604504v3.pdf#page=11) of To&euml;n: _Higher and derived stacks: a global overview_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.AG/0604504))
