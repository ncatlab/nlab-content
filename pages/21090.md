## Idea

The formalism of Markov categories can be thought of as a way to express certain aspects of [[probability]] and [[statistics]] [[analytic versus synthetic|synthetically]]. In other words, it consists of [[structures]] and [[axioms]] which one can think of as "fundamental" in probability and statistics, which one can use to prove theorems, without having to use [[measure theory]] directly. One then proves that the usual measure-theoretic treatment is a [[model]] (or [[semantics]]) of this theory.

Intuitively, for the purposes of probability a Markov category can be seen as a category where morphisms behave like "random functions", or "[[Markov kernels]]" (hence the name). Canonical examples are [[Kleisli categories]] of [[probability monads]].
The formalism is however way more general. 

**Caveat**: some of the content of this page reflects work in progress. Content may change.



## Definition

A **Markov category** is a [[semicartesian monoidal category|semicartesian]] [[symmetric monoidal category]] $(C,\otimes,1)$ in which every object $X$ is equipped with the structure of a [[commutative]] [[internal monoid|internal comonoid]].
We denote the [[counit]] and [[comultiplication]] maps by $copy: X \to X \otimes X$ and $delete: X\to 1$. 

We require the following compatibility property between the copy map and the tensor product: for all objects $X$ and $Y$, 
$$
copy_{X\otimes Y} \; =\; (id_X\otimes b_{Y,X} \otimes id_Y) ( copy_X \otimes copy_Y ),
$$
where $b$ denotes the [[braiding]].

Note that the map $delete: X\to 1$ is uniquely determined by the fact that 1 is [[terminal]], hence it is also [[natural transformation|natural]] in $X$ (see [[semicartesian monoidal category]] for more). On the other hand, the copy map is _not_ required to be natural.


### In terms of string diagrams

## Examples 

- The category $\mathsf{FinStoch}$ of finite sets and stochastic matrices.
- The category $\mathsf{Stoch}$ of [[measurable spaces]] and [[Markov kernels]]
- For any [[cartesian monoidal category]] $\mathsf{C}$ equipped with a [[monoidal monad]] $T$, the [[Kleisli category]] $Kl(T)$ is a Markov category.

See also the [[Markov category#detailed_list|detailed list below]].

## Deterministic morphisms

A morphism $f:X\to Y$ in a Markov category is called **deterministic** if it commutes with the copy map,
$$
copy \circ f \;=\; (f\otimes f) \circ copy .
$$

A way to motivate the definition is the following. Suppose that $f$ is a "random" function between real numbers, which adds to the input the result of the roll of a die. Given a number $x$, we can roll a die, add the resulting value (say, $n$) to $x$, and then copy the result, to get $(x+n,x+n)$. Or, we could copy the value $x$, roll two dice (or roll the die twice), and add the two resulting values (say, $m$ and $n$) to the two copies of $x$, obtaining $(x+m,x+n)$. The two results are likely to differ. 
One can take this as a _definition_ of randomness: it's a process that may give a different result if you do it twice. Or equivalently, that copying the information before or after the process has taken place gives different results.

A _deterministic_ morphism is instead one that does _not_ exhibit this behavior, i.e. that commutes with the copy map.
