## Idea

The **Regular Extension Axiom** (REA) is a foundational axiom which asserts the existence of arbitrarily large [[regular cardinal]]-like sets.  It has several variants, some of which are provable in [[ZF]], some of which are provable  from the [[axiom of choice]] or weaker variants thereof such as [[SVC]], and some of which are not even provable in ZFC. REA is usually considered in the context of [[CZF]].


## Variants

There is some discussion [here](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2012/04/pssl_93_trip_report.html#c041293).
