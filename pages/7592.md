## Idea

The **Regular Extension Axiom** is a foundational axiom which asserts the existence of arbitrarily large [[regular cardinal]]-like sets.  It has several variants, some of which are provable in [[ZF]], some of which are provable  from the [[axiom of choice]] or weaker variants thereof such as [[SVC]], and some of which are not even provable in ZFC.
