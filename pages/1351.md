#Idea#

Complicial sets are precisely those [[simplicial set]]s which arise as the [[oriental|omega nerve]] of a [[strict omega-category]].



#Definition#

A **complicial set** is a [[stratified simplicial set]] satisfying the following three axioms:

1. all thin 1-simplices are degenerate;

2. all inner [[complicial horn]]s have unique fillers;

3. a thinness composition axiom (to be filled in here)


#Generalizations#

Weakening the conditions on a [[stratified simplicial set]] to be a complicial set yields notions of [[simplicial weak omega-category]].
