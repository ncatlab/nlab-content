What was first called cohomology with local coefficients (Steenrod) (compare Reidemeister earlier) and still is also came to be called _Twisted cohomology_

## Larmore's work ##

The phrase _twisted cohomology_ was  used by Larmore in 

* Larmore, _Twisted cohomology theories and the single obstruction to lifting_,  Pac JM 41 (1972) 755-769

to describe
$H'(-; E)$ cohomology with coefficients in a special kind of spectrum $E$  related to a fibration $p:E\to B.$ 

The result is what May and Sigurdsson call a parameterized spectrum, the "parameters" being the points of $B$, which might also be called, in the older topological terminology, an _ex-spectrum_.

For any map $f:K\to B$ and, for $L\subset K,$ a partial lift
$h:L\to E$ of $f$, he constructs a _single_ obstruction class $\Gamma(f)\in H'(K, L  ; E)$ to a full lift $g:K\to E.$ The vanishing of this obstruction is necessary for the existence of a lifting, but it is sufficient only in the usual stable range.

Notice that his cohomology with coefficients in a spectrum does _not_ mean the sequence of cohomology groups with coefficients in the sequence of spaces constituting the spectrum, but rather a single group. He does explore the relation between his single obstruction and the classical obstructions.
