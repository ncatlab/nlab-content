One way to see the isomorphism $\mathrm{Spin}(6) \cong \mathrm{SU}(4)$ is as follows.  Let $V$ be a 4-dimensional [[complex vector space]] with an [[inner product]] and a compatible complex [[volume form]], meaning an element of the [[exterior product]] $\Lambda^4 V$ whose [[norm]] is 1 in the norm coming from the inner product on $V$. The inner product defines a conjugate-linear isomorphism $V \cong V^\ast$ (with the complex [[dual vector space]]) that together with the complex volume form can be used to define a conjugate-linear [[Hodge star operator]] on $\Lambda^2 V$.  This Hodge star operator squares to the identity, and its $+1$ and $-1$ eigenspaces, say $\Lambda_{\pm}^2 V$, each become 6-dimensional *real* inner product spaces in a natural way.  Thus, the group $\mathrm{SU}(V)$, consisting of all complex-linear transformations of $V$ that preserve the inner product and complex volume form, acts as linear transformations of $\Lambda_+^2 V$ that preserve the inner product, giving a homomorphism $\rho: \mathrm{SU}(V) \to \mathrm{O}(\Lambda_+^2 V)$.  Since $\mathrm{SU}(V)$ is connected we in fact have $\rho: \mathrm{SU}(V) \to \mathrm{SO}(\Lambda_+^2 V)$.  

Specializing to the case $V = \mathbb{C}^4$ we get a [[Lie group]] [[homomorphism]] $\rho: \mathrm{SU}(4) \to \mathrm{SO}(6)$.  Since $d\rho$ is nonzero and $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ is [[simple Lie group|simple]], $d\rho$ must be [[injective function|injective]].   Since 

$$ \mathrm{dim}(\mathrm{SU}(4)) = 15 = \mathrm{dim}(\mathrm{SO}(6)), $$

$d\rho$ must also be [[surjective function|surjective]].   Since $\mathrm{SO}(6)$ is [[connected topological space|connected]] and $d\rho$ is a [[bijection]], $\rho$ must be a [[covering map]].  Since $\rho(\pm 1) = 1$, $\rho$ exhibits $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ as a connected cover of $\mathrm{SO}(6)$ that is *at least* a [[double cover]].  But the [[universal cover]] of $\mathrm{SO}(6)$, namely $\mathrm{Spin}(6)$, is only a double cover.  Thus $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ is a double cover of $\mathrm{SO}(6)$, and $\mathrm{SU}(4) \cong \mathrm{Spin}(6)$.
