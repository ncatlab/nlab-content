## Definition

For $S$ a [[scheme]], a _cubic curve_ over $S$ is a scheme $p \colon X \to S$ over $S$ equipped with a [[section]] $e \colon S \to X$ and such that [[Zariski topology|Zariski locally]] on $S$, $X$ is given by an [[equation]] in $\mathbb{P}_S^2$ of the form

$$
  y^2 + a_1 x y = x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_4 x + a_6
$$

such that $e \colon S \to X$ is the line at infinity.

Euivalently this says that $p$ is a [[proper morphism|proper]] [[flat morphism]] with a section contained in the [[smooth locus]] whose [[fibers]] are geometrically integral curves of [[arithmetic genus]] one.

Write $\mathcal{M}_{cub}$ for the [[moduli stack]] of such [[cubic curves]]. Then the [[moduli stack of elliptic curves]] is the non-vanishing locus of the discriminant  $\Delta \in H^0(\mathcal{M}_{cub}, \omega^{12})$

$$
  \mathcal{M}_{ell} \hookrightarrow \mathcal{M}_{cub} 
  \hookrightarrow \mathcal{M}_{FG}.
$$

(e.g. [Mathew, section 3](#Mathew))

## Properties

### Covers

There is an eight-fold cover of $\mathcal{M}_{cub}$ [[localization of a ring|localized]] at $2$ ([Mathew 13, section 4.2](#Mathew13)) which is analogous to the canonical 2-fold cover of the moduli stack of formal tori (which gives the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-action on [[KU]] whose [[homotopy fixed points]] are [[KO]]).
