## Idea

The notion of **over quasi-category** is the generalization of the notion of [[overcategory]] from [[category theory]] to [[(∞,1)-category theory]] with [[(∞,1)-categories]] taken in their incarnation as [[quasi-categories]].

For $C$ an ordinary [[category]] and $c \in C$ an [[object]] of $C$, the ordinary [[over category]] $C\downarrow c$ satisfies the universal property that for any other category $C'$ there is a natural [[equivalence of categories]]

$$
  Hom(C',C\downarrow c) \simeq
  Hom_{c}(C' \star \{\top\}, C)
  \,,
$$

where

* $C' \star \{\top\}$ denotes the category $C'$ with a freely adjoined [[terminal object]] $\top$;

* $Hom_{c}(C' \star \{\top\}, C)$ denotes the category of pairs $(F,\gamma)$, where $F: C' \star \{\top\}\to C$ is a functor and $\gamma:F(\top)\to c$ is an isomorphism in $C$.

The idea of the definition of [[over category]] in the context of [[quasi-category|quasi-categories]] is to mimic this universal property. This relies crucially on generalizing the construction $C' \star \{\top\}$ to the context of quasi-categories, in terms of the [[join of quasi-categories]].

## Definition

Recall from [[join of quasi-categories]] that there are two different but quasi-catgorically equivalent definitions of _join_, denoted $\star$ and $\diamondsuit$. Accordingly we have the following two different but quasi-categoricaly equivalent definitions of over/under quasi-categories.


+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

Let $C$ be a [[quasi-category]]. let $K$ be any [[simplicial set]] and let 

$$
  F : K \to C
$$ 

be an [[(∞,1)-functor]] -- a morphism of simplicial sets. 


1. The **under-quasi-category** $C_{F/}$ is the 
   simplicial set characterized by the property 
   that for any other simplicial set $S$ there is 
   a natural bijection of hom-sets

   $$
    Hom_{sSet}(S, C_{F/})
     \cong
     (Hom_{(K\downarrow SSet)})(i_{K,S} , F)
     \,,
   $$

   where $i_{K,S} : K \to K \star S$ is the canonical inclusion of $K$ into its [[join of simplicial sets]] with $S$.

   Similarly, the **over quasi-category** over $F$ is the simplicial set
   characterized by the property that

   $$
    Hom_{sSet}(S, C_{/F})
     \simeq
     Hom_{(K\downarrow SSet)}(
       j_{K,S} , F
     )
   $$

   naturally in $S$, where $j_{K,S}$ is the canonical inclusion map $K\to S\star K$.  

1. The functor 

   $$
      sSet \to sSet_{K/}
   $$

   $$
     S \mapsto K \diamondsuit S
   $$

   with $\diamondsuit$ denoting the other definition of [[join of quasi-categories]] (as described there)

   has a [[right adjoint]]

   $$
      sSet_{K/} \to sSet
   $$

   $$
     (F : K \to C) \mapsto C^{F/} 
   $$

   and its image $C^{F/}$ is another definition of 
   the quasi-category under $F$.

The first definition in terms of the the mapping property is due to [[Andre Joyal]]. Together with the discussion of the concrete realization it appears as [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, prop 1.2.9.2]]. The second definition appears in [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT]] above prop. 4.2.1.5.

###### Proposition

The simplicial sets $C_{/F}$ and $C_{F/}$ are indeed themselves again [[quasi-categories]].

###### Proposition

The two definitions yield equivalent results in that the canonical morphism

$$ 
  C_{/F} \to C^{/F}
  \,.
$$

is an equivalence of quasi-categories.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

This is [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, prop. 4.2.1.5]]

=--

From the formula 

$$
  (C_{/F})_n = (Hom_{sSet})_F(\Delta^n \star K , C)
$$

we see that

* an object in the over quasi-category $C_{/F}$ is a **cone** over $F$;. 

  For instance if $K = \Delta[1]$ then an object in $C_{/F}$ is a 2-cell

  $$
    \array{
       && v
       \\
       & \swarrow &\swArrow& \searrow
       \\
       F(0) &&\to&& F(1)
    }
  $$

  in $C$.

* a morphism in $C_{/F}$ is a morphism of cones, 

* etc:.

So we may think of the overcategory $C_{/F}$ as the **quasi-category of cones over $F$**. Accordingly we have that

* the [[terminal object in a quasi-category|terminal object]] in $C_{/F}$ is (if it exists) the [[limit in a quasi-category|limit in]] $C$ over $F$;

* the [[terminal object in a quasi-category|initial object]] in $C_{F/}$ is (if it exists) the [[limit in a quasi-category|colimit of]] $F$ in $C$.

###### Proposition


For $C = N(\mathcal{C})$ (the [[nerve]] of) an ordinary [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$ and $K = *$, this construction coincides with the ordinary notion of [[overcategory]] $\mathcal{C}/F$ in that there is a canonical [[isomorphism]] of simplicial sets

$$
  N(\mathcal{C}/F) \simeq N(\mathcal{C})/F
  \,.
$$
