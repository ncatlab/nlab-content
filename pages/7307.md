## Idea

The notion of _[[operad]]_ comes in two broad flavors (apart from the choice of enriching category): _symmetric operads_ and _[[planar operads]]_.

Roughly, a planar operad consists of $n$-ary operations for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ equipped with a suitable notion of compositon, while a _symmetric operad_ in addition is equipped with a compatible [[action]] of the [[symmetric group]] $\Sigma_n$ on the set (or [[object]] in the enriching category) of $n$-ary operations. A [[homomorphism]] of symmetric operads is then a morphism of planar operads that in additions respects this action.


The extra "symmetry" structure carried by symmetric operads is crucial for the behaviour of the category of operads in many applications (see the examples below). Notice that it does not so much affect the idea of what a single operad is. In particular, symmetric operads are not restricted to encoding algebraic symmetric structures with symmetric $n$-ary operations! Rather, only the fixed points in the $n$-ary operations of the $\Sigma_n$-action are symmetric operations. If $\Sigma_n$ [[free action|acts freely]], then the corresponding $n$-ary operations are still maximally non-symmetric themselves.

The central example illustrating this are the operads [[Comm]] and [[Assoc]]. Regarded as symmetric [[Set]]-enriched operads, [[Comm]] has the singleton set in each degree, with _trivial_ $\Sigma_n$-action, while [[Assoc]] has $\Sigma_n$ in each degree, freely acting on itself. 

Therefore [[Comm]] is the [[terminal object]] in the [[category]] of symmetric operads (while [[Assoc]], regarded as a [[planar operad]], is the terminal object in that category). 

Multi-coured symmetric operads are equivalently known also as _[[symmetric multicategories]]_.

## Structures on the category of symmetric operads

### Boardman-Vogt tensor product

The category of symmetric operads becomes a [[closed monoidal category|closed]] [[symmetric monoidal category]] for the [[Boardman-Vogt tensor product]].

### Model structure

For $V$ a suitable [[monoidal model category]], the category of $V$-enriched symmetric operads carries a good [[model structure on operads]]. See there for more details.

## Properties

### Relation to categories

Every [[locally small category]] $C$ may be regarded as a coloured symmetric operation $j_!(C)$ over set, with the objects of $C$ and coulours, and with only unary operation, these being the morphisms in the category

$$
  j_!(C)(c_1, \cdots, c_n ; c)
  = 
  \left\{
    \array{
       C(c_1, c) & if \, n = 1
       \\
       \emptyset & otherwise
    }
  \right.
  \,.
$$

This [[functor]] $j_! : Cat \to Operad$ has a [[right adjoint]] $j^* : Operad \to Cat$ which sends an operad to the underlying category obtained by discarding all $n$-ary operations for $n \neq 1$.

Therefore there is a [[natural isomorphism]] $j * j_! \simeq id$. By the discussion at _[[adjoint functor]]_ this exhibits a [[coreflective subcategory]]

$$
  Cat 
   \stackrel{\overset{j_!}{\hookrightarrow}}{\underset{j^*}{\leftarrow}}
  Operad
  \,.
$$

## Examples

* The operad [[Comm]] for [[commutative monoids]] is the [[terminal object]] in symmetric $V$-operads, for instance for $V = $ [[Set]], [[sSet]], [[Top]], etc. 

  It has a single $n$-ary operation for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, with the [[symmetric group]] necessarily acting trivially in each degree.

* For every [[symmetric monoidal category]] $C$, there is naturally the symmetric [[endomorphism operad]] $End(C)$.
