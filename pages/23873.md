## Definition 

Given a [[category]] $C$ and objects $a, b \in Ob(A)$, a pair of [[morphisms]] $f, g \in Mor(a, b)$ are **jointly monic** if for every object $c:Ob(A)$ and pair of morphisms $h, k \in Mor(c, a)$, $f \circ h = f \circ k$ and $g \circ h = g \circ k$ imply that $h = k$. 

In a [[well-pointed category]] $C$, given objects $a, b \in Ob(A)$, a pair of [[morphisms]] $f, g \in Mor(a, b)$ are **jointly injective** if for every [[global element]] $h, k \in Mor(1, a)$, $f \circ h = f \circ k$ and $g \circ h = g \circ k$ imply that $h = k$. 

## In tablular allegories

In every [[tabular allegory]], a relation $R$ could be factored into jointly monic [[map in a dagger 2-poset|maps]] $f$ and $g$ such that $f^\dagger \circ g = R$.
