## Idea

A **vector bundle** is a [[vector space]] which "continuously varies" over a [[topological space]] $X$.

A basic example of vector bundles are [[tangent bundles]] of [[nLab:smooth manifolds]] $X$. Here the [[vector space]] at each point of $X$ is the [[tangent space]] of that point, the space of all [[tangent vectors]] based at that point. The graphics on the right shows one of the tangent space of the [[2-sphere]].

## Definition

### General

A **vector bundle** over a space $X$ is a [[bundle]] over $X$ which is locally isomorphic to a product with a [[vector space]] $V$ as fiber.  More precisely, the data is an object $\pi: E \to X$ in $Top/X$ equipped with a vector space structure [[internalization|internal]] to $Top/X$, consisting of maps 

$$+: E \times_X E \to E \qquad \cdot: \mathbb{R} \times E \to E$$ 

(where $E \times_X E$ denotes the [[fiber product]] or pullback of $\pi$ along itself) satisfying vector space axioms. This vector space object must satisfy the _local triviality condition_: there exists an [[open cover]] 

$$U = \sum_{\alpha \in A} U_\alpha \longrightarrow X$$ 

and an isomorphism from the [[pullback]] $U \times_X E$ to the projection $\pi: U \times V \to U$, 

$$\array{
U \times V & \overset{\phi}{\leftarrow} & U \times_X E & \to & E\\
 & & \downarrow & & \downarrow \pi \\
 & & U &\longrightarrow& X
}$$
 
as vector space objects in $Top/X$. The projection $U \times V \to U$ itself is called a **trivial (vector) bundle** over $U$. 

Equivalently, each fiber $E_x$ carries a vector space structure, and there exists an open covering $\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in A}$ of $X$ together with **local trivializations**: bundle isomorphisms $\phi_{\alpha}$ from a trivial bundle $U_{\alpha} \times V$ to the pullback of $\pi$ along $U_\alpha \hookrightarrow X$: 

$$\array{
\pi^{-1}(U_\alpha) & \overset{\phi_\alpha}{\to} & U_\alpha \times V\\
\pi|_{U_\alpha} \searrow & & \swarrow proj\\
& U_\alpha &
}$$ 

such that $\phi_{\alpha}$ induces a linear map $V \to E_x$ between the fibers.  

In terms of the local trivialization data, there are **transition functions** 

$$(U_\alpha \cap U_\beta) \times V \overset{\phi_\beta \circ \phi_{\alpha}^{-1}}{\to} (U_\alpha \cap U_\beta) \times V: (x, v) \mapsto (x, g_{\alpha\beta}(x)(v)),$$ 

where the $g_{\alpha\beta}(x)$ are linear [[automorphisms]] of $V$ and satisfy the Čech 1-cocycle conditions:

$$g_{\beta\gamma} \circ g_{\alpha\beta} = g_{\alpha\gamma} \qquad g_{\alpha\alpha} = id$$ 

In the converse direction, given such a collection $g_{\alpha\beta}: U_{\alpha} \cap U_\beta \to GL(V)$ satisfying the 1-cocycle conditions, there is a vector bundle obtained by pasting local trivial bundles together along the $g_{\alpha\beta}$, namely the coequalizer of a pair 

$$i, \mu: \sum_{\alpha, \beta} (U_\alpha \cap U_\beta) \times V \overset{\to}{\to} \sum_{\alpha} U_\alpha \times V$$ 

in the category of vector space objects in $Top/X$. Here the restriction of $i$ to the coproduct summands is induced by inclusion: 

$$(U_\alpha \cap U_\beta) \times V \hookrightarrow U_\alpha \times V \hookrightarrow \sum_\alpha U_\alpha \times V$$ 

and the restriction of $\mu$ to the coproduct summands is 
via the action of the transition functions: 

$$(U_\alpha \cap U_\beta) \times V \overset{(\langle incl, g_{\alpha\beta} \rangle) \times V}{\to} U_\beta \times GL(V) \times V \overset{action}{\to} U_\beta \times V \hookrightarrow \sum_{\beta} U_\beta \times V$$


**Remarks**

* In most applications, the [[ground field]] of scalars is assumed to be $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$, although sometimes other fields are allowed, as in the study of algebraic vector bundles. 

* In most cases (as in [[K-theory]]), it is implicitly assumed that the vector space $V$ is finite-dimensional. 

* In the context of differential topology or differential geometry, one also assumes that $\pi$ is smooth and that the local bundle isomorphisms $\phi_{\alpha}$ are diffeomorphisms.


### Sheaf-theoretic version

Vector bundles can also be defined via [[sheaf and topos theory|sheaf theory]], which permits easy transport to general [[Grothendieck topos]]es. Let $Sh(X)$ be the category of (set-valued) [[sheaf|sheaves]] on $X$. The sheaf of continuous local sections of the product projection 

$$X \times \mathbb{R} \to X$$ 

forms a [[local ring]] object $R$; when interpreted in the [[internal logic]] of $Sh(X)$, it is the Dedekind [[real numbers object]]. Then, according to a theorem of Richard Swan, in its sheaf-theoretic incarnation a vector bundle is the same thing as a projective $R$-module. 

* A theorem of Kaplansky states "every projective module over a local ring is free". When interpreted in [[sheaf semantics]] ([[Kripke-Joyal semantics]]), the [[existential quantifier]] implicit in "free" is interpreted _locally_, so we can consider a vector bundle as a locally free module over the Dedekind reals. 


### Virtual vector bundles

In one class of models for [[K-theory]] -- [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] theory -- cocycles are represented by $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded vector bundles (pairs of vector bundles, essentially) modulo a certain equivalence relation. In that context it is sometimes useful to consider a certain variant of infinite-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded vector bundles called [[vectorial bundle]]s.


Much else to be discussed...


## Properties

### Concordances of topological vector bundles

For $X$ a [[topological space]] write $X \times I$ for the [[product topological space]] with the [[closed interval]] $[0,1]$ equipped with its [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] [[metric topology]]. 

Write

$$
  X \overset{p_X}{\longleftarrow} X \times [0,1] \overset{p_{[0,1]}}{\longrightarrow} [0,1]
$$

for the two continuous [[projections]] out of the product space.

###### Lemma

For $X$ a [[topological space]], then a vector bundle $E \to X \times [0,1]$ is trivial if its restrictions to $X \times [0,1/2]$ and to $X \times [1/2,1]$ are trivial.

=--

+-- {: .num_lemma #CoverForProductSpaceWithIntrval}
###### Lemma

For $X$ a [[topological space]], then for every topological vector bundle $E \to X \times I$ there exists an [[open cover]] $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ of $X$ such that the vector bundle trivializes over $U_i \times [0,1] \subset X \times [0,1]$, for each $i \in I$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By local trvializability of the vector bundle, there exists an open cover $\{V_j \subset X \times I\}_{j \in J}$ over which the bundle trivializes. For each point $x \in X$ this induces a cover of $\{x\} \times [0,1]$. This is a [[compact topological space]] (for instance by the [[Heine-Borel theorem]]) and hence there exists a [[finite set|finite]] [[subset]] $J_x \subset I$ such that $\{V_i \subset X\}_{i \in J_x}$ still covers $\{x\} \times [0,1]$. 

By finiteness of $J_x$, the [[intersection]]

$$
  U_x \coloneqq \underset{i \in J_x}{\cap} p_X(V_i)
$$

is an open neighbourhood of $x$ in $X$. Moreover

$$
  \{ p_{[0,1]}(V_i) \subset I \}_{i \in J_x}
$$

is an open cover of $[0,1]$ such that the given vector bundle trivializes over each element of $\{V_x \times p_{[0,1]}(U_i)\}_{i \in J_x}$.

By the nature of the Euclidean [[metric topology]] each [[open subset]] of $[0,1]$ is a union of intervals. So we may pass to a [[refinement]] of this cover of $[0,1]$ such that each element is a single interval. Again by compactness of $[0,1]$, this refinement has a finite subcover

$$
  \{W_{x,k} \subset [0,1]\}_{k \in K_x}
$$

each element of which is an [[interval]]. Since this is a finite cover, we may find numbers $\{0 = t_0 \lt t_1 \lt t_2 \lt \cdots \lt t_{n_x} = 1\}$ such that 

$$
  \{ [t_k, t_{k+1}] \subset [0,1] \}_{0 \leq k \lt n_x}
$$

is a cover of $[0,1]$, and such that the given vector bundle still trivializes over $V_x \times [t_k, t_{k+1}]$ for all $0 \leq k \lt n_x$.

By lemma \ref{TrivilizationOfVectorBundleOverProductSpaceWithInterval} this implies that the vector bundle in fact trivializes over $U_x \times [0,1]$.

Applying this procedure for all points $x \in X$ yields a cover 

$$
  \{ U_x \subset X  \}_{x \in X}
$$

with the required property.

###### Proposition

Let $X$ be a [[paracompact topological space]]. If $E \to X \times [0,1]$ is a vector bundle, then the two endpoint-restrictions

$$
  E|_{X \times \{0\}}
  \phantom{AA}
  \text{and}
  \phantom{AA}
  E|_{X \times \{1\}}
$$

are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] vector bundles over $X$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By lemma \ref{CoverForProductSpaceWithIntrval} there exists an open cover $\{U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I}$ of $X$ such that the vector bundle $E$ trivializes over $U_i \times [0,1]$ for each $i \in I$. By lemma ... there exists a [[countable cover]] 

$$
  \{V_n \subset X\}_{n \in mathbb{N}}
$$

such that each element is a [[disjoint union]] of open subsets that each are contained in one of the $U_i$. This means that the vector bundle $E$ still trivializes over $V_n \times [0,1]$, for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

Moreover, by paraompactness there exists a [[partition of unity]] $\{f_n \colon X \to [0,1] \}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ subordinate to this countable cover.

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ define

$$
  \psi_n \coloneqq \underoverset{n}{k = 0}{\sum} f_n
$$

(so $\psi_0 = 0$ and by local finiteness there is for each $x \in X$ an $n_x$ such that $\psi_{n \gt n_x} = 1$.)

Now set

$$
  X_n \coloneqq graph( \psi_n ) \subset X \times [0,1]
$$

and write $E_n \to X_n$ for the restriction of $E$ to that subspace.

Consider the continuous functions

$$
  \array{
    X_{n+1} &\overset{}{\longrightarrow}& X_n
  }
$$

and
