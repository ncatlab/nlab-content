## Definition

A **Heyting category** (called a **logos** in [Freyd-Scedrov](#FreydScedrov)) is a [[coherent category]] in which each [[base change]] functor $f^*:Sub(Y)\to Sub(X)$ has a _[[right adjoint]]_ $\forall_f$ (the _[[universal quantifier]]_, in addition to the [[left adjoint]] [[existential quantifier]] that exists in any [[regular category]]).  

It follows that each [[poset of subobjects]] $Sub(X)$ is a [[Heyting algebra]] and the base-change functors $f^*$ are Heyting algebra homomorphisms.  Any Heyting category has an [[internal logic]] which is full ([[type theory|typed]]) [[first order logic|first-order]] [[intuitionistic logic]]. The extra right adjoint $\forall_f$ provided by the above axiom gives the [[universal quantifier]] in this logic.

A **Heyting functor** is a [[coherent functor]] betwen Heyting categories which additionally preserves the right adjoints $\forall_f$.  Such functors also preserve the [[internal logic|internal interpretation]] of [[first-order logic]].

## Examples

Any [[topos]], and in fact any [[well-powered category|well-powered]] [[infinitary coherent category]], is a Heyting category.  Any [[Boolean category]] is also a Heyting category.
