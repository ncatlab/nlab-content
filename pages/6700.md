## Idea

The local data for a [[CFT]] in [[dimension]] $d$ allows to assign to each $d$-[[dimension]]al [[cobordism]] $\Sigma$ a [[vector space]] of "possible correlator"s: those functions on the space of [[conformal structure]]s on $\Sigma$ that have the correct behaviour to qualify as the (chiral) [[correlator]] of a CFT. This is called a space of [[conformal blocks]] $Bl(\Sigma)$. This assignment is [[functor|functorial]] under [[diffeomorphism]]. The corresponding functor is called a **modular functor**.

To get an actual collection of correlators one has to choose from each space of conformal blocks $Bl(\Sigma)$ an element such that these choices glue under composition of [[cobordism]]: such that they solve the [[sewing constraints]], see for instance at _[[FRS-theorem on rational 2d CFT]]_.

Dually, under a [[holographic principle]] such as [[AdS3-CFT2 and CS-WZW correspondence|CS3/WZW2]] the space of [[conformal blocks]] on $\Sigma$ is equivalently the [[space of quantum states]] of the [[TQFT]] on $\Sigma$. See at _[[quantization of 3d Chern-Simons theory]]_ for more on this.

## Properties

### Relation to equivariant ellitpic cohomology / equivariant $tmf$

The modular functor for $G$-[[Chern-Simons theory]] restricted to [[genus of a surface|genus-1 surfaces]] ([[elliptic curves]]) is essentially what is encoded in the universal $G$-[[equivariant elliptic cohomology]] (equivariant [[tmf]]). In fact equivariant elliptic cohomology remembers also the [[local prequantum field theory|pre-quantum]] incarnation of the modular functor as a systems of [[prequantum line bundles]] over Chern-Simons [[phase spaces]] (which are [[moduli stacks of flat connections]]) and remembers the [[quantization]]-process from there to the actual [[space of quantum states]] by forming holomorphic [[sections]]. See at _[equivariant elliptic cohomology -- Idea -- Interpretation in Quantum field theory](equivariant+elliptic+cohomology#InterpretationInQuantumFieldTheory)_ for more on this.
