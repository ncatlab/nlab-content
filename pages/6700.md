## Idea

The local data for a [[CFT]] in [[dimension]] $d$ allows to assign to each $d$-[[dimension|dimensional]] [[cobordism]] $\Sigma$ a [[vector space]] of "possible [[correlators]]": those functions on the space of [[conformal structures]] on $\Sigma$ that have the correct behaviour (satisfy the conformal [[Ward identities]]) to qualify as the (chiral) [[correlator]] of a CFT. This is called a space of _[[conformal blocks]]_ $Bl(\Sigma)$. This assignment is [[functor|functorial]] under [[diffeomorphism]]. The corresponding functor is called a **modular functor**. ([Segal 89](#Segal89), [Segal 04, def. 5.1](#Segal04))

To get an actual collection of correlators one has to choose from each space of conformal blocks $Bl(\Sigma)$ an element such that these choices glue under composition of [[cobordism]]: such that they solve the [[sewing constraints]], see for instance at _[[FRS-theorem on rational 2d CFT]]_.

Dually, under a [[holographic principle]] such as [[AdS3-CFT2 and CS-WZW correspondence|CS3/WZW2]] the space of [[conformal blocks]] on $\Sigma$ is equivalently the [[space of quantum states]] of the [[TQFT]] on $\Sigma$. See at _[[quantization of 3d Chern-Simons theory]]_ for more on this.


## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn #CategoryOfRiemannSurfaces}
###### Definition

For $\Phi$ any [[finite set]] ("of lables") write $\mathcal{S}_{\Phi}$ for the [[category]] whose [[objects]] are [[Riemann surfaces]] with [[boundary]] [[circles]] labeled by elements of $\Phi$, and whose [[morphisms]] are [[holomorphic maps]] $X \to X_{sewed}$, where $X_{sewed}$ is obtained from $X$ by [[sewing constraint|sewing]] along boundary circles carrying the same labels.

=--

([Segal 04, section 4, section 5](#Segal04))

This category, being essentially the total [[Riemann moduli space]] is naturally a [[complex analytic stack]].

For $\Sigma$ a [[topological manifold|topological]] [[surface]] write $\mathcal{S}_\Sigma$ for the component of $\mathcal{S}$ on Riemann surfaces whose underlying topological surface is $\Sigma$.

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

If $\Sigma$ has at least one hole (boundary component), then the [[fundamental group]] $\pi_1(\mathcal{S}_\Sigma)$ is the [[mapping class group]] of $\Sigma$.

=--


+-- {: .num_defn #ModularFunctor}
###### Definition

A _modular functor_ is a holomorphic functor 

$$
  E \colon \mathcal{S}_\Phi \longrightarrow sFinVect
$$

(i.e. a morphism of [[complex analytic stacks]] from the [[Riemann moduli space]] to the stack of [[holomorphic vector bundles]], in general with [[super vector space]]-fibers)

such that

1. $E$ is [[strong monoidal functor|strong monoidal]]: $E(X \coprod Y) \simeq E(X)\otimes E(Y)$;

1. $E$ respects seqing: if $X_\phi$ is obtained from $X$ by cutting along a circle and giving the same label $\phi \in \Phi$ to both resulting boundaries, then the [[natural transformation]]

   $$
     \underset{\phi \in \Phi}{\oplus} E(X_\phi) \longrightarrow E(X)
   $$

   is a [[natural isomorphism]].

1. normalization: for $X = S^2$ the [[Riemann sphere]] we have $E(S^1) = 1$ (the[[tensor unit]] vector space).

## Properties

### Central charge and Central extensions

Any modular functor defines a [[central extension]] of the [[semigroup]] of conformal [[annuli]].  

These correspond precisely to [[group extensions]] of $Diff^+(S^1)$ by $\mathbb{C}^\times$.

([Segal 04, prop. 5.6](#Segal04))


These in turn are classified by $(c,h) \in \mathbb{C} \times \mathbb{C}/\mathbb{Z}$.

([Segal 04, prop. 5.8](#Segal04))

+-- {: .num_defn #CentralCharge}
###### Definition

Here in terms of standard [[2d CFT]] terminology 

*$c$ is the _central charge_ 

*$h$ is the [[eigenvalues]] of $L_0$.

=--


### The Knizhnik–Zamolodchikov-Hitchin connection

+-- {: .num_prop #TheProjFlatConnection}
###### Proposition

Given a modular functor $E$ as in def. \ref{ModularFunctor} and given a non-[[closed manifold|closed]] [[topological manifold|topological]] labelled [[surface]] $\Sigma$ with $E_\Sigma \to \mathcal{S}_\Sigma$ the resulting [[vector bundle]], then this bundle carries a canonical [[projectively flat connection]] $\nabla_\Sigma$ compatible with the [[sewing constraint|sewing operation]] of def. \ref{CategoryOfRiemannSurfaces}.

=--

([Segal 04, prop. 5.4](#Segal04))

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

When thinking of the modular functor $E$ as the functor of [[conformal blocks]] of a [[2d CFT]] then the projectively flat connection of prop. \ref{TheProjFlatConnection} would often be called the _[[Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov connection]]_. Thining of $E$ dually as the functor assigning [[spaces of quantum states]] of [[Chern-Simons theory]] then it would typically be called the [[Hitchin connection]]. (see also [Segal 04, p. 44](#Segal04)).

=--

+-- {: .num_pro #FlatConnectionForVanishingCentralCharge}
###### Proposition

The connection of prop. \ref{TheProjFlatConnection} is a genuine [[flat connection]] (not projective) precisely if the central charge, \ref{CentralCharge}, vanishes.

=--

([Segal 04, below prop. 5.4](#Segal04))

### The Verlinde fusion alegbra

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For $\phi,\chi,\psi \in \Phi$ three labels, write $P_{\phi,\chi,\psi}$ for the three-holed sphere ("pair of pants", "trinion") with inner circles labeled by $\phi$ and $\chi$ and outer circle labeled by $\psi$.

For $E$ a modular functor as in def. \ref{ModularFunctor}, write

$$
  n_{\phi, \chi,\psi} \coloneqq dim(E(P_{\phi,\chi,\psi}))
$$

for the [[dimension]] of the vector space that it assigns to this surface.

Then the [[free abelian group]] $\mathbb{Z}[\Phi]$ on the set of labels inherits the structure of an [[associative algebra]] via

$$
  (\phi,\chi) \mapsto \underset{\psi}{\sum}  n_{\phi,\chi, \psi} \psi
  \,.
$$

The _[[Verlinde algebra]]_.

=--

([Segal 04, section 5, p. 36-37](#Segal04))


### Deprojectivization, Cancelling of central charge, topological modular functor

By prop. \ref{FlatConnectionForVanishingCentralCharge} and prop. \ref{CentralChargeOfDeterminantLine}, if $E$ is a modular functor of central charge $c$ then the [[tensor product]]

$$
  \tilde E \coloneqq E \otimes Det^{\otimes c/2}
$$

with a possibly fractional power of the [[determinant line bundle]], def. \ref{PowerOfDeterminantLine}, produces a modular functor with vanishing central charge.

To make sense of this however one needs to consistently define the fractional power. This requires passing to surfaces equipped with a rigging structure or equivalent...

## Examples

### Powers of the determinant line

+-- {: .num_defn #PowerOfDeterminantLine}
###### Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ let $E = Det^{\otimes n}$ be the functor which sends a [[Riemann surface]] to the $c$th power of its [[determinant line]] (i.e. that of its [[Laplace operator]]). 

=--

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Proposition

The determinant lines of def. \ref{PowerOfDeterminantLine} constitute precisely the modular functors, def. \ref{ModularFunctor}, for which $dim(E(X)) = 1$ for all $X$.

=--

([Segal 04, corollary (5.17)](#Segal04))

+-- {: .num_prop #CentralChargeOfDeterminantLine}
###### Proposition

The central charge, def. \ref{CentralCharge}, of the determinant line $E = Det$, def. \ref{PowerOfDeterminantLine}, is

$$
 (c,h ) = (-2,0)
  \,.
$$

### Relation to equivariant elliptic cohomology / equivariant $tmf$

The modular functor for $G$-[[Chern-Simons theory]] restricted to [[genus of a surface|genus-1 surfaces]] ([[elliptic curves]]) is essentially what is encoded in the universal $G$-[[equivariant elliptic cohomology]] (equivariant [[tmf]]). In fact equivariant elliptic cohomology remembers also the [[local prequantum field theory|pre-quantum]] incarnation of the modular functor as a systems of [[prequantum line bundles]] over Chern-Simons [[phase spaces]] (which are [[moduli stacks of flat connections]]) and remembers the [[quantization]]-process from there to the actual [[space of quantum states]] by forming holomorphic [[sections]]. See at _[equivariant elliptic cohomology -- Idea -- Interpretation in Quantum field theory](equivariant+elliptic+cohomology#InterpretationInQuantumFieldTheory)_ for more on this.
