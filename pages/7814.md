## Idea

The term "support" means different things in different parts of mathematics:

### In set theory

Given $f \colon X \to A$ a [[function]] to  $A$ a [[pointed object]] with the point playing the role of a [[zero]] [[generalized element|element]], then the _support_ of $f$ is the [[subobject]] of $X$ on which $f$ is non-zero.

### In topology

In [[topology]] the support of a [[continuous function]] $f \colon X \to A$ as above is usually taken to be the [[topological closure]] of the set of point on which $f$ vanishes

$$
  Supp(f) = Cl(\{x \in X \vert f(x) \neq 0 \in A\})
  \,.
$$



### In topos theory and type theory

support = [[n-truncated object in an (infinity,1)-category|(-1)-truncation]]
