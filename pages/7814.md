## Idea

The term "support" means different things in different parts of mathematics:

### In analysis and cohomology

Given $f : X \to A$ some quantity (a [[function]] or more generally some [[cocycle]]) and for $A$ a [[pointed object]] with the point playing the role of a [[zero]] [[generalized element|element]], the _support_ of $f$ is the [[subobject]] of $X$ on which $f$ is non-zero.

### In topos theory and type theory

support = [[n-truncated object in an (infinity,1)-category|(-1)-truncation]]

## Related concepts

* [[compact support]]

* [[compactly supported cohomology]]
