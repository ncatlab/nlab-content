## Idea ##


What is called _topological_ [[K-theory]] is a collection of  [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] theories whose cocycles in degree 0 on a space $X$ can be represented by pairs of [[vector bundle]]s, real or complex ones, on $X$ modulo a certain equivalence relation.

Notice that "ordinary cohomology" is the [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] that is represented by the [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum]] which, as a stably abelian [[infinity-groupoid]] is just the additive [[group]] 

$$
  \mathbb{Z}
$$ 

of integers.

To a large extent K-theory is the [[cohomology]] theory obtained by [[vertical categorification|categorifying]] this   once:

$$
  \mathbb{Z} \;\; \mapsto something like \mathbf{Vect}
  \,.
$$

### Motivational example: "nonabelian K-cohomology" ###

To see how this works, first consider the task of generalizing the "[[nonabelian cohomology]]" or [[cohomotopy]] theory given by the coefficient object $\mathbb{N}$, the additive semi-group of  $\mathbb{N}$ of [[natural number]]s.

This does have arbitrarily high [[delooping]]s in the context of [[omega-category|omega-categories]], but not in the context of [[infinity-groupoid]]s. So for the purposes of [[cohomology]] $\mathbb{N}$ is just the [[monoid]]al [[0-groupoid]] $\mathbb{N}$ which as a coefficient object induces a very boring [[cohomology]] theory: the $\mathbb{N}$-cohomology of anything connected is just the monoidal set $\mathbb{N}$ itself. While we cannot [[delooping|deloop]] it, we can [[vertical categorification|categorify]] it and do obtain an interesting [[nonabelian cohomology]] theory:
 
Namely the [[category]] $Core(Vect)$ of finite dimensional vector spaces with invertible linear maps between them would serve as a [[vertical categorification|categorification]] of $\mathbb{N}$: isomorphism classes of finite dimensional vector spaces $V$ are given by their dimension $d(V) \in \mathbb{N}$, and [[direct sum]] of vector spaces corresponds to addition of these numbers.

If we want to use the category $Core(Vect)$ as the coefficient for a [[cohomology]] theory, we should for greater applicability equip it with its natural topological or smooth structure,  so that it makes sense to ask what the $Vect$-cohomology of a [[topological space]] or a [[smooth space]] would be. The canonical way to do this is to regard $Vect$ as a [[generalized smooth space]] called a [[smooth infinity-stack]] and consider it as the assignment

$$
  \mathbf{Vect} : Diff \to \infty Grpd
$$

$$
  U \mapsto Core(VectBund(U))
$$

that sends each smooth test space $U$ (a smooth manifold, say), to [[groupoid]] of smooth [[vector bundle]]s over $U$ with [[bundle]] [[isomorphism]]s betweem them. We regard here a vector bundle $V \to U$ as a smooth $U$-parametrized family of vector spaces (the [[fiber]]s over each point) and thus as a smooth _probe_ or _plot_  of the category $Core(Vect)$.

The [[nonabelian cohomology]] theory with coefficients in $\mathbf{Vect}$ has no [[cohomology group]]s, but at least cohomology [[monoid]]s

$$
  H(X,\mathbf{Vect}) := \pi_0 \mathbf{H}_{diff}(X, \mathbf{Vect})
  \,.
$$

It is equivalent to the [[nonabelian cohomology]] with coefficients the [[delooping]] $\mathbf{B} U$ of the stable unitary group $U := colim_n U(n)$.


### K-theory as a groupoidification of $\mathbf{Vect}$ ###

The integers $\mathbb{Z}$ are obtained from the natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$ by including "formal inverses" to all elements under the additive operation. Another way to think of this is that the [[delooping|delooped]] [[groupoid]] $\mathbf{B} \mathbb{Z}$ is obtained from $\mathbf{B} \mathbb{N}$ by groupoidification (under the [[nerve]] operation this is fibrant replacement in the [[model structure on simplicial sets]]).

The idea of K-cohomology is essentially to apply this groupoidification process to not just to $\mathbb{N}$, but to its [[vertical categorification|categorification]] $\mathbf{Vect}$.

Just as an integer $k = n-m \in \mathbb{Z}$  may be regarded as an equivalence class of natural numbers $(n,m) \in \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$  under the relation

$$
  [(n,m)] = [(n+r, m+r)] \;\; \forall r \in \mathbb{N}
$$

one can similarly look at equivalence classes of pairs $(V,W) \in \mathbf{Vect}(U) \times \mathbf{Vect}(U)$ of [[vector bundle]]s.

This perspective on K-theory was originally realized by Atiyah and Hirzebruch. The resulting cohomology theory is usually called [[topological K-theory]].

As one of several variations, it is useful to regard a pair of [[vector bundle]]s as a single $\mathbb{Z}_2$-[[graded vector space|graded vector bundle]].

One version of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded vector bundles, which lead to a description of [[twisted cohomology|twisted]] $K$-theory are [[vectorial bundle]]s.

## Definition

Let $X$ be a [[compact space|compact]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[topological space]]. Write $k$ for either the [[field]] of [[real number]]s $\mathbb{R}$ or of [[complex number]]s $C$ . By a [[vector space]] we here mean a vector space over $k$ of finite [[dimension]]. By a [[vector bundle]] we mean a topological $k$-vector bundle.  We write $I^n \to X$ for the trivial vector bundle $I^n = k^n \times X$ over $X$ of [[rank]] $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

+-- {: .num_lemma #DirectSumHasInverseUpToTrivialBundle}
###### Lemma

For every vector bundle $E \to X$ (with $X$ [[compact space|compact]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]]) there exists a [[vector bundle]] $E' \to X$ such that 

$$
  E \oplus E' \simeq I^{rank E + rank E'}
  \,.
$$

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

One invokes a [[partition of unity]] relative to an [[open cover]] on which $E$ trivializes, constructs $E'$ locally and glues.

=--

For details see for instance ([Hatcher, prop. 1.4](#Hatcher)) or ([Friedlander, prop. 3.1](#Friedlander)).



+-- {: .num_defn #DefinitionOfKClasses}
###### Definition

Define an [[equivalence relation]] on the [[set]] of finite-[[rank]] [[vector bundle]]s $E \to X$ over $X$ by declaring that $E_1 \sim E_2$ if there exists $k,l \in \mathbb{N}$ such that there is an [[isomorphism]] of vector bundles between the (fiberwise) [[direct sum]] of $E_1$ with $I^k$ and of $E_2$ with $I^l$

$$
  (E_1 \sim E_2)
  :\Leftrightarrow
  \exists (E_1 \oplus I^k \simeq E_2 \oplus I^l)
  \,.
$$

Write 

$$
  \tilde K(X) := Vect(X)_\sim
$$

for the [[quotient set]] of [[equivalence class]]es. 

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #KGroupIsIndeedAGroup}
###### Proposition

With $X$ compact Hausdorff as in the assumption, we have that fiberwise [[direct sum]] of vector bundles equips $\tilde K(X)$ with the structure of an [[abelian group]]. Together with the fiberwise [[tensor product]] of vector bundles this yields a [[ring]]. 

=--

Therefore $K(X)$ is called the **topological K-theory ring** of $X$ or just the **K-theory group** or even just the **K-theory** of $X$, for short.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The non-trivial part of the statement is that in $K(X)$ there is an [[inverse]] to the operation of direct sum of vector bundles. Because in $Vect(X)$ direct sum acts by addition of the ranks of vector bundles, it clearly has no inverse in $Vect(X)$.

On the other hand, clearly the K-class $[I^n]$ of any trivial bundle $I^n$ is the neutral element in $K(X)$

$$
  [I^n] = 0
$$

for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, because by definition $I^n \sim I^0$. Therefore an inverse of a class $[E_1]$ is given by a vector bundle $E_2$ with the property that the direct sum

$$
  E_1 \oplus E_2 \simeq I^n
$$

is isomorphic to a trivial bundle for some $n$. This is the case by lemma \ref{DirectSumHasInverseUpToTrivialBundle}.


=--

+-- {: .num_prop #EquivalenceToGrothendieckGroup}
###### Proposition

$\tilde K(X)$ is isomorphic to the [[Grothendieck group]] of $(Vect(X), \oplus)$.

=--

However, def. \ref{DefinitionOfKClasses} is more directly related to the definition of K-theory by a classifying space, hence by a [[spectrum]]. This we discuss [below](#ClassifyingSpace).


## Properties

### Classifying space
 {#ClassifyingSpace}

We discuss how the [[classifying space]] for $K^0$ is the [[delooping]] of the [[stable unitary group]].

+-- {: .num_defn #BUn}
###### Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ write $U(n)$ for the [[unitary group]] in dimension $n$ and $O(n)$ for the [[orthogonal group]] in dimension $n$, both regarded as [[topological group]]s in the standard way. Write $B U(n) , B O(n)\in$ [[Top]] $ for the corresponding [[classifying space]].

Write 

$$
  [X, B O(n)] := \pi_0 Top(X, B O(n))
$$

and

$$
  [X, B U(n)] := \pi_0 Top(X, B U(n))
$$

for the set of [[homotopy]]-classes of [[continuous function]]s $X \to B U(n)$.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #BUnClassifyingSpace}
###### Proposition

This is equivalently the set of [[isomorphism]] classes of $O(n)$- or $U(n)$-[[principal bundle]]s  on $X$ as well as of rank-$n$ real or complex [[vector bundle]]s on $X$, respectively:

$$
  [X, B O(n)] \simeq O(n) Bund(X) \simeq Vect_{\mathbb{R}}(X,n)
  \,,
$$

$$
  [X, B U(n)] \simeq U(n) Bund(X) \simeq Vect_{\mathbb{C}}(X,n)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #InclusionOfUns}
###### Definition

For each $n$ let 

$$
  U(n) \to U(n+1)
$$

be the inclusion of [[topological group]]s given by inclusion of $n \times n$ [[matrices]] into $(n+1) \times (n+1)$-matrices given by the block-diagonal form

$$
  \left[g\right] \mapsto 
  \left[
    \array{
      1 & [0]
      \\ 
      [0] & [g]
    }
  \right]
  \,.
$$

This induces a corresponding sequence of morphisms of classifying spaces, def. \ref{BUn}, in [[Top]]

$$
  B U(0) \hookrightarrow B U(1) \hookrightarrow B U(2) \hookrightarrow \cdots
  \,.
$$

Write 

$$
  B U := {\lim_{\to}}_{n \in \mathbb{N}} B U(n)
$$

for the [[homotopy colimit]] (the "homotopy [[direct limit]]") over this diagram (see at _[[homotopy colimit]]_ the section _[Sequential homotopy colimits](homotopy+limit#SequentialHocolims)_).

=--

+-- {: .num_note }
###### Note

The [[topological space]] $B U$ is **not** equivalent to $B U(\mathcal{H}) $, where $U(\mathcal{H})$ is the [[unitary group]] on a separable infinite-dimensional [[Hilbert space]] $\mathcal{H}$. In fact the latter is [[contractible]], hence has a  [[weak homotopy equivalence]] to the point

$$  
  B U(\mathcal{H}) \simeq *
$$

while $B U$ has nontrivial [[homotopy group]]s in arbitrary higher degree (by [[Kuiper's theorem]]). 

But there is the group $U(\mathcal{H})_{\mathcal{K}} \subset U(\mathcal{H})$ of unitary operators that differ from the [[identity]] by a [[compact operator]]. This is essentially $U = \Omega B U$. See [below](#Uk). 

=--

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

Write $\mathbb{Z}$ for the set of [[integer]]s regarded as a [[discrete topological space]].

The product spaces

$$
  B O \times \mathbb{Z}\,,\;\;\;\;\;B U \times \mathbb{Z}
$$

are [[classifying space]]s for real and complex $K$-theory, respectively: for every compact Hausdorff topological space $X$, we have an isomorphism of groups

$$
  \tilde K(X)
  \simeq
  [X, B U ]
  \,.
$$


$$
  K(X)
  \simeq
  [X, B U \times \mathbb{Z}]
  \,.
$$

=--

See for instance ([Friedlander, prop. 3.2](#Friedlander)) or ([Karoubi, prop. 1.32, theorem 1.33](#Karoubi)).

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First consider the statement for reduced cohomology $\tilde K(X)$:

Since a [[compact topological space]] is a [[compact object]] in [[Top]] (and using that the [[classifying space]]s $B U(n)$ are (see there) [[paracompact topological space]]s, hence normal, and since the inclusion morphisms are closed inclusions (...)) the [[hom-functor]] out of it commutes with the [[filtered colimit]]

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    Top(X, B U)
    &=
    Top(X, {\lim_\to}_n B U(n))
    \\
    & \simeq {\lim_\to}_n Top(X, B U (n))
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

Since $[X, B U(n)] \simeq U(n) Bund(X)$, in the last line the colimit is over [[vector bundle]]s of all ranks and identifies two if they become isomorphic after adding a trivial bundle of some finite rank.

For the full statement use that by prop. \ref{missing} we have

$$
  K(X) \simeq H^0(X, \mathbb{Z}) \oplus \tilde K(X)
  \,.
$$

Because $H^0(X,\mathbb{Z}) \simeq [X, \mathbb{Z}]$ it follows that

$$
  H^0(X, \mathbb{Z}) \oplus \tilde K(X)
  \simeq
  [X, \mathbb{Z}] \times [X, B U]
  \simeq
  [X, B U \times \mathbb{Z}]
  \,.
$$

=--

There is another variant on the classifying space 

+-- {: .num_defn #Uk}
###### Definition

Let 

$$
  U_{\mathcal{K}}
  = 
  \left\{
    g \in U(\mathcal{H}) | g - id \in \mathcal{K}
  \right\}
$$ 

be the group of unitary operators on a [[separable Hilbert space]] $\mathcal{H}$ which differ from the identity by a [[compact operator]].

=--

Palais showed that


+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

$U_\mathcal{K}$ is a [[homotopy equivalence|homotopy equivalent]] model for $B U$. It is in fact the [[norm closure]] of the evident model of $B U$ in $U(\mathcal{H})$. 

Moreover $U_{\mathcal{K}} \subset U(\mathcal{H})$ is a [[Banach Lie group|Banach Lie]] [[normal subgroup]].

=--

Since $U(\mathcal{H})$ is [[contractible]], it follows that 

$$
  B U_{\mathcal{K}} \coloneqq U(\mathcal{H})/U_{\mathcal{K}}
$$

is a model for the [[classifying space]] of reduced K-theory.

### Spectrum 

Being a [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] theory, toplogical K-theory is represented by a [[spectrum]]: the _[[K-theory spectrum]]_.

The degree-0 part of this spectrum, i.e. the classifying space for degree 0 topological $K$-theory is modeled in particular by the space $Fred$ of [[Fredholm operator]]s.

### Relation to algebraic K-theory
 {#RelationToAlgebraicKTheory}

The topological K-theory over a space $X$ is not
identical with the _[[algebraic K-theory]]_ of the
ring of functions on $X$, but the two are closely related. See for instance ([Paluch](#Paluch), [Rosenberg](#Rosenberg)).
