## Idea ##


What is called _topological_ [[K-theory]] is a collection of  [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] theories whose cocycles in degree 0 on a [[topological space]] $X$ may be represented by pairs of [[vector bundles]], real or complex ones, on $X$ modulo a certain equivalence relation.

The following is the quick idea. For a detailed introduction see _[[Introduction to Topological K-Theory]]_.

First, recall that for $k$ a [[field]] then a $k$-[[vector bundle]] over a [[topological space]] $X$ is a map $V \to X$ whose [[fibers]] are [[vector spaces]] which vary over $X$ in a controlled way. Explicitly this means that there exits an [[open cover]] $\{U_i \to X\}$ of $X$, a [[natural number]] $n \in \mathbb{N}$ (the _[[rank of a vector bundle|rank]]_ of the vector bundle) and a [[homeomorphism]] $U_i \times k^n \to V|_{U_i}$ over $U_i$ which is fiberwise a $k$-[[linear map]].

Vector bundles are of central interest in large parts of [[mathematics]] and [[physics]], for instance in [[Chern-Weil theory]] and [[cobordism theory]]. But the collection $Vect(X)_{/\sim}$ of [[isomorphism classes]] of vector bundles over a given space is in general hard to analyze. One reason for this is that these are classified in degree-1 _[[nonabelian cohomology]]_ with [[coefficients]] in the ([[nonabelian group|nonabelian]]) [[general linear group]] $GL(n,k)$. K-theory may roughly be thought of as the result of forcing vector bundles to be classified by an abelian [[cohomology theory]].

To that end, observe that all natural operations on [[vector spaces]] generalize to vector bundles by applying them [[fiber]]-wise. Notably there is the fiberwise [[direct sum of vector bundles]], also called the _[[nLab:Whitney sum]]_ operation. This operation gives the set $Vect(X)_{/\sim}$ of [[nLab:isomorphism classes]] of vector bundles the structure of an [[semi-group]] ([[monoid]]) $(Vect(X)_{/\sim},\oplus)$.

Now as cunder direct sum, the [[nLab:dimension]] of vector spaces adds, similarly under [[nLab:direct sum of vector bundles]] their [[nLab:rank]] adds.  Hence in analogy to how one passes from the  additive [[semi-group]] ([[monoid]]) of  [[natural numbers]] to the addtitive [[group]] of [[integers]] by adjoining formal additive inverses, so one may adjoin formal additive inverses to $(Vect(X)_{/\sim},\oplus)$. By a general prescription ("[[Grothendieck group]]") this is achieved by first passing to the larger class of [[pairs]] $(V_+,V_-)$ of vector bundles ("[[virtual vector bundles]]"), and then [[quotient|quotienting]] out the [[equivalence relation]] given by

$$
  (V_+, V_-) \sim (V_+ \oplus W , V_- \oplus W)
$$

for all $W \in Vect(X)_{/\sim}$. The resulting set of [[equivalence classes]] is an [[abelian group]] with group operation given on representatives by

$$
  [V_+, V_-] \oplus [V'_+, V'_-] \coloneqq (V_+ \oplus V'_+, V_- \oplus V'_-)
$$

and with the [[inverse]] of $[V_+,V_-]$ given by

$$
  -[V_+, V_-] = [V_-, V_+]
  \,.
$$

This [[abelian group]] obtained from $(Vect(X)_{/\sim}, \oplus)$ is denoted $K(X)$ and often called _the K-theory_ of the space $X$. Here the letter "K" (due to [[Alexander Grothendieck]]) originates as a shorthand for the German word _Klasse_, referring to the above process of forming [[equivalence classes]] of ([[isomorphism classes]]) of vector bundles.

This simple construction turns out to yield remarkably useful groups of [[homotopy]] [[invariants]].
A variety of deep facts in [[algebraic topology]] have fairly elementary proofs in terms of topolgical K-theory, for instance the [[Hopf invariant one]] problem ([Adams-Atiyah 66](#AdamsAtiyah66)).

One defines the "higher" K-groups of a topological space to be those of its higher [[suspensions]]

$$
  K^{-n}(X) = K(\Sigma^n X)
  \,.
$$

The assignment $X \mapsto K^\bullet(X)$ turns out to share many properties of the assignment of [[ordinary cohomology]] groups $X \mapsto H^n(X,\mathbb{Z})$. One says that topological K-theory is a [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] theory. As such it is [[Brown representability theorem|represented]] by a [[spectrum]]. For $k = \mathbb{C}$ this is called [[KU]], for $k = \mathbb{R}$ this is called [[KO]]. (There is also the unification of both in [[KR]]-theory.)

One of the basic facts about topological K-theory, rather unexpected from the definition, is that these higher K-groups repeat _periodically_ in the degree $n$. For $k = \mathbb{R}$ the periodicity is 8, for $k = \mathbb{C}$ it is 2. This is called _[[Bott periodicity]]_.


It turns out that an important source of [[virtual vector bundles]] representing classes in [[K-theory]] are [[index bundles]]: Given a [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian]] [[spin structure|spin]] [[manifold]] $B$, then there is a [[vector bundle]] $S \to B$ called the _[[spin bundle]]_ of $B$, which carries a [[differential operator]], called the [[Dirac operator]] $D$. The [[index of a Dirac operator]] is the formal difference of its [[kernel]] by its [[cokernel]] $[ker D, coker D]$. Now given a continuous family $D_x$ of Dirac operators/Fredholm operators, parameterized by some topological space $X$, then these indices combine to a class in $K(X)$.

It is via this construction that topological K-theory connects to [[spin geometry]] (see e.g. [[Karoubi K-theory]]) and [[index theory]].

As the terminology indicates, both [[spin geometry]] and [[Dirac operator]] originate in [[physics]]. Accordingly, K-theory plays a central role in various areas of [[mathematical physics]], for instance in the theory of [[geometric quantization]] ("[[spin^c quantization]]") in the theory of [[D-branes]] (where it models [[D-brane charge]] and [[RR-fields]]) and in the theory of [[Kaluza-Klein compactification]] via [[spectral triples]] (see below).

All these geometric constructions have an [[operator algebra|operator algebraic]] incarnation: by the topological [[Serre-Swan theorem]] then [[vector bundles]] of finite rank are equivalently [[modules]] over the [[C*-algebra]] of [[continuous functions]] on the base space. Using this relation one may express K-theory classes entirely operator algebraically, this is called _[[operator K-theory]]_. Now [[Dirac operators]] are generalized to [[Fredholm operators]].

There are more [[C*-algebras]] than arising as [[algebras of functions]] of [[topological space]], namely non-commutative C*-algebras. One may think of these as defining [[non-commutative geometry]], but the definition of [[operator K-theory]] immediately generalizes to this situation (see also at _[[KK-theory]]_).

While the [[C*-algebra]] of a [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian]] [[spin structure|spin]] [[manifold]] remembers only the underlying [[topological space]], one may algebraically encode the [[smooth structure]] and [[Riemannian structure]] by passing from [[Fredholm modules]] to "[[spectral triples]]". This may for instance be used to algebraically encode the spin physics underlying the [[standard model of particle physics]] and [[operator K-theory]] plays a crucial role in this.



## Definition
 {#Definition}

> under construction

Throughout, let $k$ be either the [[field]] of [[real numbers]] $\mathbb{R}$ or of [[complex numbers]] $\mathbb{C}$ .

We take

1. _[[vector space]]_ to mean _[[finite dimensional vector space]]_ over $k$.

1. _[[vector bundle]]_ to mean _[[topological vector bundle]] over $k$ of finite [[rank of a vector bundle|rank]]_.


For the most part below we will assume that the base [[topological space]] $X$ is a [[compact Hausdorff space]]. Because then the following statement holds, which is crucial in some places:

+-- {: .num_lemma #DirectSumHasInverseUpToTrivialBundle}
###### Lemma
**(over [[compact Hausdorff space]] every [[topological vector bundle]] is [[direct sum of vector bundles|direct summand]] of a [[trivial vector bundle]])**

For every [[topological vector bundle]] $E \to X$ over the [[compact Hausdorff space]] $X$ there exists a [[topological vector bundle]] $\tilde E \to X$ such that the [[direct sum of vector bundles]]

$$
  E \oplus_X \tilde E \simeq X \times \mathbb{R}^{n}
$$

is a [[trivial vector bundle]].

=--

For **proof** see [this prop.](TopologicalVectorbundleOverCompactHausdorffSpaceIsDirectSummandOfTrivialBundle) at _[[topological vector bundle]]_.

### The K-group

+-- {: .num_defn #SemigroupOfIsomorphismClassesOfTopologicalVectorBundlesOnX}
###### Definition
**([[semi-group]] of [[isomorphism classes]] of [[topological vector bundles]] on $X$)

For $X$ a [[topological space]], write $Vect(X)_{/\sim}$ for the [[set]] of [[isomorphism classes]] of [[topological vector bundles]] over $X$. The operation of [[direct sum of vector bundles]]

$$
  (-)\oplus_X (-)
  \;\colon\;
  Vect(X) \times Vect(X)
    \longrightarrow
  Vect(X)
$$

descends to this [[quotient]] by [[isomorphism]]

$$
  [E_1] + [E_2]
  \;\coloneqq\;
  [E_1 \oplus_X E_2]
$$

to yield the structure of a [[monoid]] ([[semi-group]])

$$
  \left(
     Vect(X)_{/\sim}, +
  \right)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #KGroupByGrothendieckGroup}
###### Definition
**(K-group as the [[Grothendieck group]] of [[isomorphism classes]] of [[topological vector bundles]])

For $X$ a [[topological space]], write

$$
  K(X) \;\coloneqq\; K(Vect(X)_{/\sim}, +)
$$

for the [[Grothendieck group]] of the [[semi-group]] of [[isomorphism classes]] of [[topological vector bundles]] on $X$
from def. \ref{SemigroupOfIsomorphismClassesOfTopologicalVectorBundlesOnX}.

This means that $K(X)$ is the [[group]] whose elements are [[equivalence classes]] of pairs

$$
  ([E_+], [E_-]) \; \in Vect(X)_{/\sim} \times Vect(X)_{/\sim}
$$

of [[isomorphism classes]] of [[topological vector bundles]] on $X$, with respect to the
[[equivalence relation]]

$$
  \big(
  \left(
    [E_+], [E_-]
  \right)
   \;\sim\;
  \left(
    [F_+, F_-]
  \right)
  \big)
   \;\Leftrightarrow\;
  \left(
    \underset{[G],[H] \in Vect(X)_{/\sim}}{\exists}
    \left(
      \left([E_+ \oplus_X G] , [E_- \oplus_X G]\right)
        \,=\,
      \left([F_+ \oplus_X H] , [F_- \oplus_X H]\right)
    \right)
  \right)
  \,.
$$

Here a pair $([E_+], [E_-])$ is also called a _[[virtual vector bundle]]_, and its equivalence class under the
above equivalence relation is also denoted

$$
  [E_+] - [E_-] \;\;\in K(X)
  \,.
$$

If $X$ is a [[pointed topological space]], hence equipped with a choice of point $x \in X$

then difference of [[rank of a vector bundle|ranks]] $rk_x(-)$ of the representing vector bundles
over the [[connected component]] of $x \in X$

$$
  rk_x(E_+) -  rk_x(E_-) \in \mathbb{Z}
$$

is called the _virtual rank_ of the virtual vector bundle.

=--

+-- {: .num_example #KGroupOfThePoint}
###### Example
**(K-group of the point is the [[integers]])**

Let $X = \ast$ be the [[point]]. Then a [[topological vector bundle]] on $X$ is just a [[vector space]]

$$
  Vect(\ast) \simeq Vect
$$

and an isomorphism of vector bundles is just a bijective [[linear map]].

Since [[finite dimensional vector spaces]] are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] precisely if they have the same
[[dimension]], the [[semi-group]] of isomorphism classes of vector bundles over the point (def. \ref{SemigroupOfIsomorphismClassesOfTopologicalVectorBundlesOnX})
is the [[natural numbers]]:

$$
  \left(
    Vect(\ast)_{/\sim}, +
  \right)
    \;\simeq\;
  \left(
    \mathbb{N}, +
  \right)
  \,.
$$

Accordingly the K-group of the point is the [[Grothendieck group]] of the natural numbers, which is the
additive group of [[integers]]:

$$
  K(\ast) \simeq (\mathbb{Z}, +)
$$

and this identification is the assignment of _virtual rank_ (def. \ref{KGroupByGrothendieckGroup}).

+-- {: .num_remark #OnCompactHausdorffVirtualVectorBundlesAreFormalDifferentcesWithATrivialBundle}
###### Remark
**(on [[compact Hausdorff spaces]] all [[virtual vector bundles]] are formal difference by a [[trivial vector bundle]])**

If $X$ is a [[compact Hausdorff space]], then every [[virtual vector bundle]] on $X$ (def. \ref{KGroupByGrothendieckGroup})
of the form

$$
  [E] - [X \times k^n]
$$

(i.e. for the negatice component represented by a [[trivial vector bundle]]).

This is because for $X$ compact Hausdorff then lemma \ref{DirectSumHasInverseUpToTrivialBundle} implies
that for every [[topological vector bundle]] $E_-$ there exists a topological vector bundle $\tilde E_-$
with $E_- \oplus_X \tilde E_- \simeq X \times k^n$, and hence

$$
  [E_+] - [E_-]
  =
  \underset{[E]}{\underbrace{[E_+] + [\tilde E_-]}}
    -
  \underset{[X \times k^n]}{\underbrace{ \left( [E_-] + [\tilde E_-] \right) } }
  =
  [E] - [X \times k^n]
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark #KTheoryRing}
###### Remark
**([[commutative ring]] structure on $K(X)$ from [[tensor product of vector bundles]])**

Also the operation of [[tensor product of vector bundles]] over $X$ descends to
[[isomorphism classes of vector bundles]] and makes $(Vect(X)_{\sim}, \oplus, \oplus)$
a [[semi-ring]] ([[rig]]).

(This is the shadow under passing to isomorphism classes of the fact that the [[category]] $Vect(X)$
is a [[distributive monoidal category]] under [[tensor product of vector bundles]]).

This  mulitlicative structure passes to the K-group (def. \ref{KGroupByGrothendieckGroup}) by the formula

$$
  [E_+, E_-] \cdot [F_+, F_-]
    \;\coloneqq\;
  [ (E_+ \otimes_X F_+) \oplus_X (E_- \otimes_X E_-) \,,\, (E_+ \otimes_X F_-) \oplus_X (E_- \otimes_X F_+)  ]
  \,.
$$

Accordingly the ring $(K(X), +,\cdot)$ is also called the _K-theory ring_ of $X$.

=--


+-- {: .num_remark #FunctorialityOfKGroup}
###### Remark
**([[functor|functoriality]] of the K-theory ring assignment)

Let $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ be a [[continuous function]] between [[topological spaces]].
The operation of [[pullback of vector bundles]]

$$
  f^\ast \;\colon\; Vect(Y) \longrightarrow Vect(X)
$$

is compatible with [[direct sum of vector bundles]] as well as with [[tensor prouct of vector bundles]]
and hence descends to a [[homomorphism]] of [[commutative rings]]

$$
  f^\ast \;\colon\; K(Y) \longrightarrow K(X)
$$

between the K-theory rings from remark \ref{KTheoryRing}. Moreover, for

$$
  X \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} Y \overset{g}{\longrightarrow} Z
$$

two consecutive [[continuous functions]], then the consecutive pullback
of the vector bundle is isomorphic to the pullback along the composite map, which
means that on K-group pullback preserves composition

$$
  (g \circ f)^\ast = f^\ast \circ g^\ast \;\colon\; K(Z) \longrightarrow K(X)
  \,.
$$

Finally, of course pullback along an [[identity function]] $id_X \colom X \to X$ is the identity group
homomorphism.

In summary this says that the assignment of K-groups to topological spaces is a [[functor]]

$$
  K(-)
   \;\colon\;
  Top
    \longrightarrow
  CRing
$$

from the [[category]] [[Top]] of [[topological space]] to the category [[CRing]] of [[commutative rings]].

=--

We consider next the image of plain vector bundles in [[virtual vector bundles]]:

+-- {: .num_prop #StableEquivalenceOfVectorBundles}
###### Definition
**([[stable equivalence of vector bundles]])**

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]]. Define an [[equivalence relation]] $\sim_{stable}$ on [[topological vector bundles]]
over $X$ by declaring two vector bundles $E_1 E_2 \in Vect(X)$ to be equivalent if there exists a
[[trivial vector bundle]] $X \times k^n$ of some [[rank]] $n$ such that after [[tensor product of vector bundles]]
with this trivial bundle, both bundles become [[isomorphism|isomorphic]]

$$
  \left(
    E_1
      \sim_{stable}
    E_2
  \right)
    \;\Leftrightarrow\;
  \underset{n \in \mathbb{N}}{\exists}
  \left(
     E_1 \otimes_X (X \times k^n)
       \;\simeq\;
     E_2 \otimes_X (X \times k^n)
  \right)
  \,.
$$

If $E_1 \sim_{stable} E_2$ we say that $E_1$ and $E_2$ are _stably equivalent vector bundles_.

=--


+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition
**([[image]] of plain [[vector bundles]] in [[virtual vector bundles]])**

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]]. There is a [[homomorphism]] of [[semigroups]]

$$
  \array{
    Vect(X)_{/\sim}
      & \longrightarrow &
    K(X)
    \\
    [E_1] &\overset{\phantom{AAA}}{\mapsto}& \left( [E_1], [X \times k^0] \right)
  }
$$

from the [[isomorphism classes]] of [[topological vector bundles]] (def. \ref{SemigroupOfIsomorphismClassesOfTopologicalVectorBundlesOnX})
to the K-group of $X$ (def. \ref{KGroupByGrothendieckGroup} ).

If $X$ is a [[compact Hausdorff space]],
then the [[image]] of this function is the [[stable equivalence classes of vector bundles]] (def. \ref{StableEquivalenceOfVectorBundles}),
hence this function factors as an [[epimorphism]] onto $Vect(X)_{/\sim_{stable}}$ followed by an [[injection]]

$$
  Vect(X)_{/\sim}
    \longrightarrow
  Vect(X)_{/\sim_{stable}}
    \hookrightarrow
  K(X)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The homomorphism of semigroups $Vect(X)_{/\sim} \to K(X)$ is the one given by the
[[universal property]] of the [[Grothendieck group]] construction.

By definition of the [[Grothendieck group]], two elements of the form

$$
  \left(
    [E_1], [X \times k^0]
  \right)
  \phantom{AA}
  \text{and}
  \phantom{AA}
  \left(
    [E_2], [X \times k^0]
  \right)
$$

are equivalent precisely if there exist vector bundles $F_1$ and $F_2$ such that

$$
  \left(
     [ E_1 \oplus_X F_1 ], [ F_1]
  \right)
   \;=\;
  \left(
    [E_2 \oplus_X F_2], [F_2]
  \right)
  \,.
$$

First of all this means that $F_1 \simeq F_2$, hence is equivalent to the existence of a vector
bundle $F$ such that


$$
  [E_1 \oplus F] \;=\; [E_2 \oplus F]
  \,.
$$

Now, by the assumption that $X$ is compact Hausdorff, lemma \ref{DirectSumHasInverseUpToTrivialBundle}
implies that there exists a vector bundle $\tilde F$ such that

$$
  F \oplus_X \tilde F \simeq X \times k^n
$$

is the [[trivial vector bundle]] of some [[rank of a vector bundle|rank]] $n \in \mathbbN}$. This means that the above is equivalent already to the existence of an
$n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that

$$
 [E_1 \oplus (X \times k^n)]
   \;=\;
 [E_2 \oplus (X \times k^n)]
 \,.
$$

This is the definition of stable equivalence from def. \ref{StableEquivalenceOfVectorBundles}.

and $rk_x(E) \in \mathbb{N}$ denotes the [[rank of a vector bundle|rank]] of this vector bundl over the [[connected component]]
of $x \in X$.

Equivalently this means that every element of $K(X)$ decomposes as follows into a
piece that has vanishing virtual rank over the connected component of $x$ and a virtual trivial bundle.

###### Proposition

For $X$ a [[compact Hausdorff space]] then the commutative [[semi-group]] $(Vect(X)_{/\sim_{red}}, +)$
from def. \ref{EquivalenceRelationForReducedKTheory} and an actual [[abelian group]] and is
in fact [[natural isomorphism|naturally isomorphic]]
to the [[reduced K-theory]] group $\tilde K(X)$ (def. \ref{KernelReducedKGroup}):

$$
  \tilde K(X) \simeq (Vect(X)_{/\sim_{red}}, +)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By prop. \ref{KGrupDirectSummandReducedKGroup} $\tilde K(X)$ is the subgroup of the [[Grothendieck group]] $K(X)$
on the elements of the form $[E]- [X \times k^{rk_x(E)}]$, which are cleraly entirely determined by
$[E] \in Vect(X)_{/\sim}$. Hence we need to check if the equivalence relation of the Gorthendieck 
goup coincides with $\sim_{red}$ on these representatives. 

The relation in the Grothendieck group is given by

$$
  \left(
    [E_1]
      \sim
    [E_2]
  \right)
    \Leftrightarrow
  \left(
    \underset{[G], [H] \in Vect(X)_{/\sim}}{\exists}
    \left(
      ( [E_1]+ [G], [X \times k^{rk_x(E_1)}] + [G] )
      \;=\;
      ( [E_2] + [H], [X \times k^{rk_x(E_2)}] + [H] )
    \right)
  \right)
$$

As before, in remark \ref{OnCompactHausdorffVirtualVectorBundlesAreFormalDifferentcesWithATrivialBundle}
we may assume without restriction that $G = X \times k^{n_1}$ and $H = X \times k^{n_2}$ are [[trivial vector bundles]]. Then 
the above equality on the first component

$$
  [E_1] + [X \times k^{n_1}]
  =
  [E_2] + [X \times k^{n_2}]
$$ 

is the one that defines $\sim_{red}$, and since isomorphic vector bundles
necessarily have the same rank, it implies the equality of the second component.

###### Remark
**([[non-unital ring|non-unital]] [[commutative ring]]-structure on $\tilde K(X)$)**

In view of the [[commutative ring]] structure on the K-group $K(X)$ from remark \ref{KTheoryRing},
the reduced K-group $\tilde K(X)$ from def. \ref{KernelReducedKGroup}, being the [[kernel]]
of a ring [[homomorphism]] (remark \ref{FunctorialityOfKGroup}) is an ideal in $K(X)$, 
hence itself a [[non-unital ring|non-unital]] [[commutative ring]].

(The ring unit of $K(X)$ is the class $[X \times k^1, X \times k^0]$ of the [[trivial vector bundle|trivial]]
[[line bundle]] on $X$, which has virtual rank 1, and hence is not in $\tilde K(x)$.)

###### Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ write $U(n)$ for the [[unitary group]] in dimension $n$ and $O(n)$ for the [[orthogonal group]] in dimension $n$, both regarded as [[topological group]]s in the standard way. Write $B U(n) , B O(n)\in$ [[Top]] $ for the corresponding [[classifying space]].

Write

$$
  [X, B O(n)] := \pi_0 Top(X, B O(n))
$$

and

$$
  [X, B U(n)] := \pi_0 Top(X, B U(n))
$$

for the set of [[homotopy]]-classes of [[continuous function]]s $X \to B U(n)$.

+-- {: .num_prop #BUnClassifyingSpace}
###### Proposition

This is equivalently the set of [[isomorphism]] classes of $O(n)$- or $U(n)$-[[principal bundle]]s  on $X$ as well as of rank-$n$ real or complex [[vector bundle]]s on $X$, respectively:

$$
  [X, B O(n)] \simeq O(n) Bund(X) \simeq Vect_{\mathbb{R}}(X,n)
  \,,
$$

$$
  [X, B U(n)] \simeq U(n) Bund(X) \simeq Vect_{\mathbb{C}}(X,n)
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .num_defn #InclusionOfUns}
###### Definition

For each $n$ let

$$
  U(n) \to U(n+1)
$$

be the inclusion of [[topological group]]s given by inclusion of $n \times n$ [[matrices]] into $(n+1) \times (n+1)$-matrices given by the block-diagonal form

$$
  \left[g\right] \mapsto
  \left[
    \array{
      1 & [0]
      \\
      [0] & [g]
    }
  \right]
  \,.
$$

This induces a corresponding sequence of morphisms of classifying spaces, def. \ref{BUn}, in [[Top]]

$$
  B U(0) \hookrightarrow B U(1) \hookrightarrow B U(2) \hookrightarrow \cdots
  \,.
$$

Write

$$
  B U := {\lim_{\to}}_{n \in \mathbb{N}} B U(n)
$$

for the [[homotopy colimit]] (the "homotopy [[direct limit]]") over this diagram (see at _[[homotopy colimit]]_ the section _[Sequential homotopy colimits](homotopy+limit#SequentialHocolims)_).

=--

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

The [[topological space]] $B U$ is **not** equivalent to $B U(\mathcal{H}) $, where $U(\mathcal{H})$ is the [[unitary group]] on a separable infinite-dimensional [[Hilbert space]] $\mathcal{H}$. In fact the latter is [[contractible]], hence has a  [[weak homotopy equivalence]] to the point

$$
  B U(\mathcal{H}) \simeq *
$$

while $B U$ has nontrivial [[homotopy group]]s in arbitrary higher degree (by [[Kuiper's theorem]]).

But there is the group $U(\mathcal{H})_{\mathcal{K}} \subset U(\mathcal{H})$ of unitary operators that differ from the [[identity]] by a [[compact operator]]. This is essentially $U = \Omega B U$. See [below](#Uk).

###### Proposition

Write $\mathbb{Z}$ for the set of [[integer]]s regarded as a [[discrete topological space]].

The product spaces

$$
  B O \times \mathbb{Z}\,,\;\;\;\;\;B U \times \mathbb{Z}
$$

are [[classifying spaces]] for real and complex $K$-theory, respectively: for every compact Hausdorff topological space $X$, we have an isomorphism of groups

$$
  \tilde K(X)
  \simeq
  [X, B U ]

$$
  K(X)

See for instance ([Friedlander, prop. 3.2](#Friedlander)) or ([Karoubi, prop. 1.32, theorem 1.33](#Karoubi)).

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First consider the statement for reduced cohomology $\tilde K(X)$:

Since a [[compact topological space]] is a [[compact object]] in [[Top]] (and using that the [[classifying spaces]] $B U(n)$ are (see there) [[paracompact topological space]]s, hence normal, and since the inclusion morphisms are closed inclusions (...)) the [[hom-functor]] out of it commutes with the [[filtered colimit]]

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    Top(X, B U)
    &=
    Top(X, {\lim_\to}_n B U(n))
    \\
    & \simeq {\lim_\to}_n Top(X, B U (n))
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

Since $[X, B U(n)] \simeq U(n) Bund(X)$, in the last line the colimit is over [[vector bundle]]s of all ranks and identifies two if they become isomorphic after adding a trivial bundle of some finite rank.

For the full statement use that by prop. \ref{missing} we have

$$
  K(X) \simeq H^0(X, \mathbb{Z}) \oplus \tilde K(X)
  \,.
$$

Because $H^0(X,\mathbb{Z}) \simeq [X, \mathbb{Z}]$ it follows that

$$
  H^0(X, \mathbb{Z}) \oplus \tilde K(X)
  \simeq
  [X, \mathbb{Z}] \times [X, B U]
  \simeq
  [X, B U \times \mathbb{Z}]
  \,.
$$

=--

There is another variant on the classifying space

+-- {: .num_defn #Uk}
###### Definition

Let

$$
  U_{\mathcal{K}}
  =
  \left\{
    g \in U(\mathcal{H}) | g - id \in \mathcal{K}
  \right\}
$$

be the group of unitary operators on a [[separable Hilbert space]] $\mathcal{H}$ which differ from the identity by a [[compact operator]].

=--

Palais showed that


+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

$U_\mathcal{K}$ is a [[homotopy equivalence|homotopy equivalent]] model for $B U$. It is in fact the [[norm closure]] of the evident model of $B U$ in $U(\mathcal{H})$.

Moreover $U_{\mathcal{K}} \subset U(\mathcal{H})$ is a [[Banach Lie group|Banach Lie]] [[normal subgroup]].

=--

Since $U(\mathcal{H})$ is [[contractible]], it follows that

$$
  B U_{\mathcal{K}} \coloneqq U(\mathcal{H})/U_{\mathcal{K}}
$$

is a model for the [[classifying space]] of reduced K-theory.

### As a generalized cohomology theory

That topological K-theory satisfies the axioms of a [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology theory]] was shown (at least) in (Atiyah-Hirzebruch 61, 1.8](#AtiyahHirzebruch61))

### Spectrum

Being a [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] theory, topological K-theory is represented by a [[spectrum]]: the _[[K-theory spectrum]]_.

The degree-0 part of this spectrum, i.e. the classifying space for degree 0 topological $K$-theory is modeled in particular by the space $Fred$ of [[Fredholm operator]]s.

### As the shape of the smooth K-theory spectrum

See at _[[differential cohomology diagram]]_.

### Relation to algebraic K-theory
 {#RelationToAlgebraicKTheory}

The topological K-theory over a space $X$ is not
identical with the _[[algebraic K-theory]]_ of the
ring of functions on $X$, but the two are closely related. See for instance ([Paluch](#Paluch), [Rosenberg](#Rosenberg)). See at _[[comparison map between algebraic and topological K-theory]]_.
