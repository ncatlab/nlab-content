## Idea

The _Chern classes_ are the [[integral cohomology|integral]] [[characteristic class]]es 

$$
  c_i : B U \to B^{2 i} \mathbb{Z}
$$

of the [[classifying space]] $B U$ of the [[unitary group]].

Accordingly these are characteristic classes of $U$-[[principal bundle]]s and hence of [[complex numbers|complex]] [[vector bundle]]s.

The first Chern class is the unique characteristic class of [[circle group]]-principal bundles.

The analogous classes for the [[orthogonal group]] are the [[Pontryagin class]]es.

## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For $n \geq 1$ the Chern universal [[characteristic classes]] $c_i \in H^{2i}(B U(n), \mathbb{Z})$ of the [[classifying space]] $B U(n)$ of the [[unitary group]] are characterized as follows:

1. $c_0 = 1$ and $c_i = 0$ if $i \gt n$;

1. for $n = 1$, $c_1$ is the canonical generator of $H^2(B U(1), \mathbb{Z})\simeq \mathbb{Z}$;

1. under pullback along the inclusion $i : B U(n) \to B U(n+1)$ we have $i^* c_i^{(n+1)} = c_i^{(n)}$;

1. under the inclusion $B U(k) \times B U(l) \to B U(k+l)$ we have $i^* c_i = \sum_{j = 0}^i c_i \cup c_{j-i}$.

## Properties

### General 

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The [[cohomology ring]] of $B U(n)$ is the [[polynomial]] algebra on the Chern classes:

$$
  H^\bullet(B U(n), \mathbb{Z})
  \simeq
  \mathbb{Z}(c_1, \cdots, c_n)
  \,.
$$

### First Chern class

* The [[first Chern class]] of a bundle $P$ is the class of its [[determinant line bundle]] $det P$

  $$
    c_1(P) = [det P]
    \,.
  $$

  See [[determinant line bundle]] for more.

### Splitting principle and Chern roots
 {#SplittingPrinciple}


Under the [[splitting principle]] all Chern classes are determnined by [[first Chern classes]]: 

Write $i \colon T \simeq U(1)^n \hookrightarrow U(n)$ for the [[maximal torus]] inside the [[unitary group]], which is the [[subgroup]] of diagonal unitary matrices. Then 

$$
  H^\bullet(B T, \mathbb{Z}) \simeq H^\bullet(B U(1)^n, \mathbb{Z})
$$

is the [[polynomial ring]] in $n$ [[generators]] (to be thought of as the universal [[first Chern classes]] $c_i$ of each copy of $B U(1)$; equivalently as the [weights](group+character#RelationToChernRootsAndSplittingPrinciple) of the [[group characters]] of $U(n)$) which are traditionally written $x_i$:

$$
  H^\bullet(B U(1)^n, \mathbb{Z})  \simeq \mathbb{Z}[x_1, \cdots, x_n]
  \,.
$$

Write 

$$
  B i \;\colon\; B U(1)^n \to B U(n)
$$

for the induced map of [[deloopings]]/[[classifying spaces]], then the $k$-universal Chern class $c_k \in H^{2k}(B U(n), \mathbb{Z})$ is uniquely characterized by the fact that its pullbacl to $B U(1)^n$ is the $k$th [[elementary symmetric polynomial]] $\sigma_k$ applied to these first Chern classes:

$$
 (B i)^\ast (c_k) = \sigma_k(x_1, \cdots, x_n)
  \,.
$$

Equivalently, for $c = \sum_{i = 1}^n c_k$ the formal sum of all the Chern classes, and using the fact that the [[elementary symmetric polynomials]] $\sigma_k(x_1, \cdots, k_n)$ are the degree-$k$ piece in $(1+x_1) \cdots (1+x_n)$, this means that

$$
 (B i)^\ast (c) = (1+x_1) (1+ x_2) \cdots (1+ x_n)
  \,.
$$

Since here on the right the first Chern classes $x_i$ appear as the [[roots]] of the Chern polynomial, they are also called **Chern roots**.
