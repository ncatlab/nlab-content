 
The _singular simplicial complex_ $S_\bullet(X)$ of a [[topological space]] $X$ is the [[nerve]] of $X$ with respect to the standard cosimplicial topological space $\Delta_{Top} : \Delta \to Top$:

$$
  S_n(X) = Hom_{Top}(\Delta_{Top}^n, X)
  \,.
$$

This is always a [[Kan complex]] and as such has the interpretation of the [[fundamental infinity-groupoid]] $\Pi(X)$ of $X$.
