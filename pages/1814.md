##Idea

This construction 'probes' a space $X$ by mapping geometric simplices into it. It is one of the classical approaches to determining invariants of the homotopy type of the space.  

## Definition

The _singular simplicial complex_ $S_\bullet(X)$ of a [[topological space]] $X$ is the [[nerve]] of $X$ with respect to the standard [[cosimplicial object|cosimplicial]] topological space $\Delta_{Top} : \Delta \to Top$:

$$
  S_n(X) = Hom_{Top}(\Delta_{Top}^n, X)
  \,.
$$

This is always a [[Kan complex]] and as such has the interpretation of the [[fundamental âˆž-groupoid]] $\Pi(X)$ of $X$.

The $n$-simplices of this are just _singular n-simplices_ generalising paths in $X$. (The term -singular_ is used because there is no restriction that the continuous function used should be an embedding, as would be the case in, for instance, a [[triangulation]] where a simplex in the underlying [[simplicial complex]] corresponds to an embedding of a simplex.)


## Properties

Together with its [[adjoint functor|adjoint]] -- [[geometric realization]] $|-| : sSet \to Top$ -- the functor $Sing : Top \to sSet$ is part of the [[Quillen equivalence]] between the [[model structure on topological spaces]] and the [[model structure on simplicial sets]] that is sometimes called the [[homotopy hypothesis]]-theorem.
