##Idea

This construction 'probes' a space $X$ by mapping geometric simplices into it. It is one of the classical approaches to determining invariants of the homotopy type of the space.  

## Definition

The _singular simplicial complex_ $S_\bullet(X)$ of a [[topological space]] $X$ is the [[nerve]] of $X$ with respect to the standard [[cosimplicial object|cosimplicial]] topological space $\Delta_{Top} : \Delta \to Top$.  It is thus the [[simplicial set]], $S_\bullet(X)$, having

$$
  S_n(X) = Hom_{Top}(\Delta_{Top}^n, X)
  \,.
$$

as its set of $n$-simplices, and fairly obvious faces and degeneracy mappings obtains by restriction along the structural maps of $\Delta_{Top} : \Delta \to Top$.  This is always a [[Kan complex]] and as such has the interpretation of the [[fundamental ∞-groupoid]] $\Pi(X)$ of $X$.

The $n$-simplices of this are just _[[singular simplex|singular n-simplices]]_ generalising paths in $X$. (The term -singular_ is used because there is no restriction that the continuous function used should be an embedding, as would be the case in, for instance, a [[triangulation]] where a simplex in the underlying [[simplicial complex]] corresponds to an embedding of a simplex.)


## Properties

### Relation to geometric realization

Together with its [[adjoint functor|adjoint]] -- [[geometric realization]] $|-| : sSet \to Top$ -- the functor $Sing : Top \to sSet$ is part of the [[Quillen equivalence]] between the [[model structure on topological spaces]] and the [[model structure on simplicial sets]] that is sometimes called the [[homotopy hypothesis]]-theorem.

### Relation to ordinary (co)homology

Forming from the singular simplicial complex $Sing(X)$ first the free [[simplicial abelian group]] $\mathbb{Z}[Sing(X)]$ and then under the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] the corresponding [[normalized chain complex]] yields the [[chain complex]] of (normalized!) singular chains, which computes the [[singular homology]] of $X$.
