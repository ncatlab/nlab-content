I'm a PhD student at the University of Adelaide in South Australia and I work at the [National Centre for Vocational Education Research](http://www.ncver.edu.au/). I work on 2-bundles and internal groupoids, with general interest in homotopy theory apr&egrave;s Grothendieck.

See my [private $n$Lab area](http://ncatlab.org/davidroberts/show/HomePage) - which I mean to update at some point. If you, dear reader, feel like it, please have a read of the first chapter of my thesis (found at the bottom of the page [here](http://ncatlab.org/davidroberts/show/HomePage)). It concerns internal anafunctors and localising the 2-catgories of categories and groupoids internal to a site.
