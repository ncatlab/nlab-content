I'm a recently submitted PhD student at the University of Adelaide (in Australia) and I work at the [National Centre for Vocational Education Research](http://www.ncver.edu.au/). I work on 2-bundles and internal groupoids, with general interest in homotopy theory apr&egrave;s Grothendieck.

See my [private $n$Lab area](http://ncatlab.org/davidroberts/show/HomePage) for various things, including a project on Lie fundamental bigroupoids being undertaken jointly with [[Andrew Stacey]] and various scribbles.

#### Selected writings ####

* _Internal categories and anafunctors_ (PhD thesis, chapter I) 
([pdf](http://ncatlab.org/davidroberts/files/internal_cats_and_anafunctors.pdf))

This chapter is of independent interest, and is much smaller than the full thesis:

* _Fundamental bigroupoids and 2-covering spaces_ (full PhD thesis) 
([pdf](http://ncatlab.org/davidroberts/files/DMR_thesis.pdf))

For a lite introduction to the ideas in my thesis, see

* [2-covering spaces](http://ncatlab.org/davidroberts/files/DMRAustMS09.pdf) - Slides from a talk at the 2009 Annual Meeting of the Australian Mathematical Society, at the University of South Australia. 30 September 2009

Only slightly related to my thesis (and in a hidden way that never got written up) is this article:

* _The inner automorphism 3-group of a strict 2-group_ (joint with [[Urs Schreiber]]) ([arXiv](http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/0708.1741))
