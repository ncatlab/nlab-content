I'm a visiting research fellow at the [University of Adelaide](http://www.maths.adelaide.edu.au/) and I work at the [National Centre for Vocational Education Research](http://www.ncver.edu.au/). I work on 2-bundles and internal groupoids/categories, and category theory more generally with a side interest in foundations.

**Abstract:** This thesis introduces two main concepts: the fundamental [[bigroupoid]] of a [[topological groupoid]] and 2-covering spaces, a [[nLab:vertical categorification|categorification]] of [[nLab:covering space|covering spaces]]. The first is applied to the second to show, among other things, that the fundamental [[2-group]] of the 2-covering space is a sub-2-group of the fundamental 2-group of the base. Along the way we derive general results about [[bicategory of fractions|localisations]] of the 2-categories of categories and groupoids internal to a [[site]] at classes of [[weak equivalence of internal categories|weak equivalences]], construct a topological fundamental bigroupoid of [[nLab:well-connected space|locally well-behaved]] spaces, and finish by providing a rich source of examples of 2-covering spaces, including a [[functor|functorial]] 2-connected 2-covering space.
