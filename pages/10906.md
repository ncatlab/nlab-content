## Idea

The notion of _coherence space_ ([Girard 1989, ยง8 ](#Girard89), also sometimes "[[coherent space]]" but beware of the alternative meaning discussed there) is used for the [[semantics]] of [[linear logic]] in [[proof theory]].  They form a [[star-autonomous category]].


Coherence spaces can be defined as [[arity spaces]] for the "subunary" class of arities $\{0,1\}$.

## Definition

A coherence space $X$ is a collection of subsets of a set $|X|$ which verify some conditions. We call:

* $|X|$ the web of $X$
* the elements of $|X|$, the points of $X$
* the elements of $X$, the cliques of $X$

The conditions to be verified are:

* Every subset of a clique is a clique.
* If $a$ is a point, then $\{a\}$ is a clique.
* If $A$ is a family of cliques such that $(x,y \in A) \Rightarrow (x \cup y \in A)$, then $\bigcup A$ is a clique.

## Properties

\begin{proposition}
The map which send an [[undirected simple graph]] $G$ to the pair $(C(G), V(G))$ where $V(G)$ is the set of all the vertices of $G$ and $C(G)$ is the set of all the [[cliques]] of $G$ is a bijection between undirected simple graphs and coherence spaces where the coherence space associated to $G$ is $C(G)$ with $|C(G)|=V(G)$. The reciprocal map associates to a coherence space $X$ the undirected simple graph $G$ obtained by taking $V(G)=|X|$ and the set $E(G)$ of edges equal to the set of all cliques of cardinal $2$.
\end{proposition}
