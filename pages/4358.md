## Definition

A __prime number__ is a [[natural number]] with exactly two factors: $1$ and itself.

Classically, $1$ was also counted as a prime number, but that is no longer done; it is [[too simple to be simple|too prime to be prime]].


## Properties

### Relation to ideals

A number is prime if and only if it generates a [[maximal ideal]] in the [[rig]] $\mathbb{N}$ of natural numbers.


Prime numbers do *not* quite match the [[prime elements]] of $\mathbb{N}$, since $0$ generates a [[prime ideal]] but not a maximal ideal; instead they match the [[irreducible element]]s ([Wikipedia](http://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Irreducible_element)).
