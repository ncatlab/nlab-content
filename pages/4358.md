A _prime number_ is a [[natural number]] which cannot be written as a [[multiplication|product]] of two smaller numbers, hence a natural number greater than 1, which is [[division|divisible]] only by 1 and by itself.

This means that every [[natural number]] $n \in \mathbb{N}$ is, up to re-ordering of factors, _uniquely_ expressed as a product of a tuple of prime numbers:

$$
  n \;=\; 2^{n_1}  \cdot 3^{n_2} \cdot  5^{n_3} \cdot 7^{n_4} \cdot  11^{ n_5 } \cdots
$$

This is called the _prime factorization_ of $n$.

Notice that while the number $1 \in \mathbb{N}$ is, clearly, only divisible by one and by itself, hence might look like it deserves to be counted as a prime number, too, this would break the uniqueness of this prime factorization. In view of the general phenomenon in classifications in [[mathematics]] of some objects being _[[too simple to be simple]]_ one could say that 1 is "too prime to be prime".

However, historically, some authors did count 1 as a prime number, see e.g. [Roegel 11](#Roegel11).


## Relation to ideals and arithmetic geometry
  {#RelationToIdeals}

A number is prime if and only if it generates a [[maximal ideal]] in the [[rig]] $\mathbb{N}$ of [[natural numbers]].

Prime numbers do *not* quite match the [[prime elements]] of $\mathbb{N}$, since $0$ generates a [[prime ideal]] but not a maximal ideal; instead they match the [[irreducible elements]] ([Wikipedia](http://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Irreducible_element)).

From the [[Isbell duality|Isbell-dual]] point of view, where a [[commutative ring]] such as the [[integers]] $\mathbb{Z}$ is regarded as the [[ring of functions]] on some [[variety]], namely on [[Spec(Z)]], the fact that prime numbers $p$ correspond to [[maximal ideals]] means that they correspond to the _[[closed points]]_ in this variety (see [this Example](Zariski+topology#SpecZ)), one also writes

$$
  (p) \in Spec(\mathbb{Z})
  \,.
$$

This [[Isbell duality|dual]] perspective on [[number theory]] as being the [[geometry]] ([[algebraic geometry]]) over [[Spec(Z)]] is called _[[arithmetic geometry]]_.
