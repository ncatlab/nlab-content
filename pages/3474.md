This name is used for the [[fundamental group]] of a [[scheme]], as defined by [[Grothendieck]] in [[SGA1]].

##Definition

 Let $S$ be a connected [[scheme]]. Recall that a finite [[étale cover]] of $S$ is a finite flat 
surjection $X\to S$ such that each fibre at a point $s \in S$ is the spectrum of a finite [[étale algebra]] over the local ring at $s$. Fix a [[geometric point]] $\overline{s} : Spec(\Omega) \to \Omega$. 

For a finite étale cover, $X\to S$,  we consider the [[geometric fibre]], $X\times_S Spec (\Omega)$, over  $\overline{s}$, and denote by $Fib_\overline{s} (X)$ its 
underlying set. This gives a set-valued functor on the category of finite étale covers 
of $X$.

The *algebraic fundamental group*, $\pi_1(S,  \overline{s})$ is defined to be the automorphism group 
of this functor.


For more on this area, see at _[[étale homotopy]]_.
