[[!redirects radial]]
In the theory of [[locally convex topological vector spaces]], certain types of subset turn up more frequently than others.  One such is _radial_ subsets.  In a radial subset, and line segment from the origin to a point in the subset is contained in the subset.  Thus the condition is similar to that of being convex, except that one of the end-points in the convexity condition is constrained to be the origin.
Thus a convex set containing the origin is automatically radial.

The precise definition is as follows.

###### Definition
Let $E$ be a [[locally convex space|locally convex topological vector space]].  A subset $A$ of $E$ is **radial** if $r A \subseteq A$ for each $r \in [0,1]$.

A radial set is clearly a [[star-shaped region]].
