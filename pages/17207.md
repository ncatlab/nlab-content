## Idea 

A *shelf* is a set with a binary operation that distributes over itself. Shelves are similar to [[racks]] (and there are forgetful functors from racks to shelves), but shelves are axiomatically simpler. 

## Definitions 

A **left shelf** is a set with a binary operation $\triangleright$ obeying the left self-distributive law

$$ a \triangleright (b \triangleright c) = (a \triangleright b)\triangleright (a \triangleright  c)   .$$

Similarly a set with a binary operation $\triangleleft$ obeying the right self-distributive law is called a **right shelf**.

A unital left shelf (meaning a left shelf together with an element that acts as an [[identity element|identity]] on both the left and the right) is the same as a graphic monoid: for a proof see [[graphic category]]. 

## Examples 

### In set theory 

Shelves make an appearance in set theory via [[large cardinal]] axioms. Let $(V, \in)$ be a model of [[ZFC]], and let $V_\lambda \subseteq V$ be the collection of elements of rank less than an [[ordinal]] $\lambda$ of $V$. One (rather strong) large cardinal axiom on (limit ordinals) $\lambda$ is: 

> There exists an [[elementary embedding]] $j: V_\lambda \to V_\lambda$ on the [[structure]] $(V_\lambda, \in)$ that is not the identity. 

Then, for $A \subseteq V_\lambda$, let $j(A)$ denote the [[image]] under $j$; if we regard $A$ as an unary relation on $V_\lambda$, then $j$ induces an elementary embedding $(V_\lambda, \in, A) \to (V_\lambda, \in, j(A))$. In particular, if $k$ is any elementary embedding $(V_\lambda, \in) \to (V_\lambda, \in)$, which as a set of ordered pairs we may regard as a subset of $V_\lambda$, then $j(k)$ as a set of ordered pairs is also an elementary self-embedding of $(V_\lambda, \in)$. We get in this way a binary operation $(j, k) \mapsto j(k)$ on elementary embeddings, which we denote as $(j, k) \mapsto j \cdot k$, and it is not difficult to verify that $\cdot$ is left self-distributive. 

Let $F_1$ denote the [[free object|free]] left shelf generated by 1 element. If $E_\lambda$ denotes the collection of elementary embeddings on the structure $(V_\lambda, \in)$, then the preceding observations imply that $E_\lambda$ is a left shelf, so any $j \in E_\lambda$ induces a shelf homomorphism 

$$\phi_j: F_1 \to E_\lambda.$$

###### Theorem 
**(Laver)** 
If $j \in E_\lambda$ is not the identity, then $\phi_j$ is injective.

The famous *Laver tables* (derived from set-theoretic considerations which we omit for now) describe certain [[finite set|finite]] quotients of $F_1$. Letting $x$ denote the generator of $F_1$, define $x_n$ by $x_1 = x$ and $x_{n+1} = x_n \cdot x$. The quotient of $F_1$ by the single relation $x_{m+1} = x$ is a shelf of cardinality $2^k$, the largest power of $2$ dividing $m$; it is denoted $A_k$. It can be described alternatively as the unique left shelf on the set $\{1, 2, \ldots, 2^k\}$ such that $p \cdot 1 = p + 1 \mod 2^k$ (here $p$ represents the image of $x_p$ under the quotient $F_1 \to A_k$). 

The "multiplication table" of an $A_k$ is called a Laver table. The behavior of Laver tables is largely not understood, but we mention a few facts. The first row consisting of entries $1 \cdot p$ is periodic (of some order dividing $2^k$). Under the large cardinal assumption that a nontrivial elementary self-embedding on a $V_\lambda$ exists, this period $f(k)$ tends to $\infty$ as $k$ does, but whether it does as a consequence of ZFC is not known. What *is* known is that this period, even if it increases to $\infty$, does so quite slowly: if we define $g(m)$ to be the smallest $k$ such that $f(k) \geq m$, then $g$ grows more quickly than say the Ackermann function.
