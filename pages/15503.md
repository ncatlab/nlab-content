This Jaeger was actually one of my favorite watches of SIHH. It    is a simple Master Ultra Thin case (same as used in last yearâ€™s awesome 39mm moonphase) and is the only of the four toubillons we are showing here that is automatic. It is also the least expensive of the four time-only tourbillons at around 50,000 euro.Saturday, September 14, 2013
