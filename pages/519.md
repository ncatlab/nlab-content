## Definition

A pair 

$$
  (L \dashv R) : C \stackrel{\overset{L}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{R}{\to}} D
$$

of [[adjoint functor]]s between [[category|categories]] $C$ and $D$, is characterized by a [[natural isomorphism]]

$$ 
  C(L X,Y) \cong D(X,R Y) 
$$

of [[hom-set]]s for [[object]]s $X\in D$ and $Y\in C$.  Two [[morphism]]s 
$f:L X \to Y$ and $g : X \to R Y$ which correspond under this bijection are said to be **adjuncts** of each other.  That is, $g$ is the (right-)adjunct of $f$, and $f$ is the (left-)adjunct of $g$.  Sometimes one writes $g = f^\sharp$ and $f = g^\flat$, as in musical notation.

Sometimes people call $\tilde f$ the "adjoint" of $f$, and vice versa, but this is potentially confusing because it is the _functors_ $F$ and $G$ which are adjoint.  Other possible terms are _conjugate_, _transpose_, and [[mate]].

###### Proposition
**(adjuncts in terms of adjunction (co-)unit)**


Let $i_X : X \to R L X$ be the [[unit of an adjunction|unit of the adjunction]] and $\eta_X : L R X \to X$ the counit.

Then 

* the adjunct of $f : X \to R Y$ in $D$ is the composite

  $$
    \tilde f : L X \stackrel{L f}{\to} L R Y \stackrel{\eta_Y}{\to} Y
  $$

* the adjunct of $g : L X \to Y$ in $C$ is the composite

  $$  
    \tilde g : X \stackrel{i_X}{\to} R L X \stackrel{R g}{\to} R Y
  $$

## Examples

* The process of [[currying]] is an instance of passage to adjuncts, specialized to the tensor-hom adjunction of a [[closed monoidal category]].
