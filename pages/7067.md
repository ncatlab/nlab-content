## Idea

The structure of an _algebraic model category_ is a refinement of that of a [[model category]].

Where a bare [[model category]] structure is a [[category with weak equivalences]] refined by two [[weak factorization systems]] ($(cofibrations, acyclic fibrations)$ and $(acyclic cofibrations, fibrations)$) in an algebraic model structure these are refined further to [[algebraic weak factorization systems]].

This extra structure supplies more control over constructions in the model category. For instance its choice induces a [[weak factorization system]] also in every [[diagram]] [[category]] of the given model category.

## Properties

Every [[cofibrantly generated model category]] structure can be lifted to that of an algebraic model category
