## Idea

Every [[variety]] in positive [[characteristic]] has a [[formal group]] attached to it. This group is often related to arithmetic properties of the variety such as being ordinary or supersingular.


## Definition

Let $X$ be a [[smooth scheme|smooth]] [[proper scheme|proper]] $n$ [[dimension|dimensional]] [[variety]] over an [[algebraically closed field]] $k$ of positive [[characteristic]] $p$. Define the [[functor]] $\Phi: Art_k\to Grp$ by $\Phi(S)=\mathrm{ker}(H^n_{et}(X\otimes S, \mathbb{G}_m)\to H^n_{et}(X, \mathbb{G}_m))$. It is a fundamental result of the [paper of Artin and Mazur](#ArtinMazur) that under these hypotheses the functor is [[prorepresentable functor|prorepresentable]] by a one-dimensional [[formal group]]. This is known as the **Artin-Mazur formal group** .



## Examples

For a [[curve]], this group is often called the **formal [[Picard group]]** $\widehat{\mathrm{Pic}}$.

For a [[surface]], this group is called the **formal [[Brauer group]]** $\widehat{Br}$.
