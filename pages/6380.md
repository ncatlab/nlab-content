## Idea

Every [[variety]] in positive [[characteristic]] has a [[formal group]] attached to it, called the _Artin-Mazur formal group_. This group is often related to arithmetic properties of the variety such as being ordinary or supersingular.

The Artin-Mazur formal group in dimension $n$ is a [[formal group]] version of the [[Picard infinity-group|Picard n-group]] of flat/holomorphic [[circle n-bundles]] on the given variety. Therefore for $n = 1$ one also speaks of the _[[formal Picard group]]_ and for $n = 2$ of the _[[formal Brauer group]]_.


## Definition

### Deformations of higher line bundles

Let $X$ be a [[smooth scheme|smooth]] [[proper scheme|proper]] $n$ [[dimension|dimensional]] [[variety]] over an [[algebraically closed field]] $k$ of positive [[characteristic]] $p$. 

Writing $\mathbb{G}_m$ for the [[multiplicative group]] and $H_{et}^\bullet(-,-)$ for [[etale cohomology]], then $H_{et}^n(X,\mathbb{G}_m)$ classifies $\mathbb{G}_m$-[[principal infinity-bundle|principal n-bundles]] ([[line n-bundles]], [[bundle 2-gerbe|bundle (n-1)-gerbes]]) on $X$.  Notice that, by the discussion at _[Brauer group -- relation to étale cohomology](Brauer%20group#RelationToEtaleCohomology)_, for $n = 1$ this is the [[Picard group]] while for $n = 2$ this contains (as a [[torsion subgroup]]) the [[Brauer group]] of $X$.

Accordingly, for each [[Artin algebra]] regarded as an [[infinitesimally thickened point]] $S \in ArtAlg_k^{op}$ the [[cohomology group]] $H_{et}^n(X\times_{Spec(k)} S,\mathbb{G}_m)$ is that of [[equivalence classes]] of $\mathbb{G}_n$-[[principal infinity-bundle|principal n-bundles]] on a formal thickening of $X$.

The defining inclusion $\ast \to S$ of the unique global point induces a restriction map $H^n_{et}(X\times_{Spec(k)} S, \mathbb{G}_m)\to H^n_{et}(X, \mathbb{G}_m))$ which restricts an $n$-bundle on the formal thickening to just $X$ itself. The [[kernel]] of this map hence may be thought of as the group of $S$-parameterized infinitesimal [[deformations]] of the trivial $\mathbb{G}_m$-$n$-bundle on $X$. 

(For $n = 1$ this is an [[infinitesimal neighbourhood]] of the neutral element in the [[Picard scheme]] $Pic_X$, for higher $n$ one will need to genuinely speak about [[Picard stacks]] and higher stacks.)

As $S$ varies, these groups of deformations naturally form a [[presheaf]] on "[[infinitesimally thickened points]]" ([[Isbell duality|formal duals]] to [[Artin  algebras]])

$$
  \Phi_X^n \;\colon\; ArtAlg_k \to Grp 
$$

$$
  \Phi_X^n(S) \coloneqq \mathrm{ker}(H^n_{et}(X\times_{Spec(k)} S, \mathbb{G}_m)\to H^n_{et}(X, \mathbb{G}_m))
  \,.
$$ 

The fundamental result of ([Artin-Mazur 77](#ArtinMazur77)) is that under the above hypotheses this presheaf if [[prorepresentable functor|pro-representable]] by a one-dimensional [[formal group]], which we may hence also denote by $\Phi_X^n$. This is called the **Artin-Mazur formal group** of $X$ in degree $n$.

### Deformations of higher line bundles with connection

In ([Artin-Mazur 77, section III](#ArtinMazur77)) is also discussed the formal deformation theory of [[line n-bundles with connection]] (classified by [[ordinary differential cohomology]], being [[hypercohomology]] with [[coefficients]] in the [[Deligne complex]]). Under suitable conditions this yields a [[formal group]], too.


## Examples

* For a [[curve]], this group is often called the **[[formal Picard group]]** $\widehat{\mathrm{Pic}}$.

* For a [[surface]], this group is called the **[[formal Brauer group]]** $\widehat{Br}$.
