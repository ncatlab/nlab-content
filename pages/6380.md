## Idea

Every [[variety]] in positive characteristic has a [[formal group]] attached to it. This group is often related to arithmetic properties of the variety such as being ordinary or supersingular.


## Definition

Let $X$ be a smooth proper $n$ dimensional variety over an algebraically closed field $k$ of positive characteristic $p$. Define the functor $\Phi: Art_k\to Grp$ by $\Phi(S)=\mathrm{ker}(H^n_{et}(X\otimes S, \mathbb{G}_m)\to H^n_{et}(X, \mathbb{G}_m))$. It is a fundamental result of the paper of Artin and Mazur that under these hypotheses the functor is [[prorepresentable functor|prorepresentable]] by a one-dimensional formal group. This is known as the Artin-Mazur formal group.



### Examples

For a curve, this group is often called the formal Picard group $\widehat{\mathrm{Pic}}$.

For a surface, this group is called the formal Brauer group $\widehat{Br}$.
