## Idea 

In as far as we may think of [[simplicial set]]s having some suitable properties as a [[simplicial model for weak ∞-categories]] (for instance for [[quasi-category|quasi-categories]]) and of a simplicial set that has the property of being a [[Kan complex]] as an [[∞-groupoid]], _Kan fibrant replacement_ of simplicial sets is the operation of _$\infty$-groupoidification_ in that it sends an $\infty$-category to the $\infty$-groupoid obtained by freely inverting all its non-invertible [[k-morphism]]s.

Technically, the terminology comes from the fact that with respect to the standard [[model structure on simplicial sets]] the [[Kan complex]]es are precisely the fibrant objects.


There are several methods to actually construct the Kan fibrant replacement. One convenient one, called the $Ex$ functor -- described below -- constructs an $\infty$-groupoid from (the nerve of) an $\infty$-category $C$ by

- taking its 1-morphisms to be ([[cospan|co]])[[span]]s in $C$;

- taking its 2-morphisms to be cospan-of-cospan [[multispan]]s in $C$:

- taking its 3-morphisms to be cospan-of-cospan-of-cospan [[multispan]]s in $C$:

- etc. 

## $Ex$ functor 


For $\Delta^k$ the simplicial $k$-[[simplex]] let $sd \Delta^k$ be its **barycentric [[subdivision]]** : this is the simplicial set that is the [[nerve]] of the [[poset]] of non-degenerate sub-simplicies in $\Delta^k$.

Notice that this simplicial set $sd \Delta^k$ encodes the shape of a $k$-fold [[cospan]] of [[cospan]]s.

For instance,
$$
  sd \Delta^1 = \{0 \to (0,1) \leftarrow 1\}
$$
is the ordinary [[cospan]].

These multi-cospan simplicial sets define a functor $Ex : SSet \to SSet$ by setting

$$
  (Ex X)_k = Hom_{SSet}(sd \Delta[k], X)
  \,.
$$

So this functor reads in a simplicial set $X$ and spits out the simplicial set whose 1-cells are [[cospan]]s in $X$.

This comes with a natural map

$$
  X \to Ex X
  \,.
$$

Iterating this construction indefinitely defines a simplicial set $Ex^\infty X$ to be the [[colimit]] over

$$
  X \to Ex X \to Ex Ex X \to \cdots
  \,.
$$

The 1--cells in $Ex^\infty X$ are [[zig-zag]]s in $X$.



Then

**Proposition**

* $Ex^\infty X$ is a [[Kan complex]];

* $X \to Ex^\infty X$ is a natural weak equivalence,
in fact, an [[acyclic cofibration]],
even more strongly, it is a strong anodyne extension,
i.e., a transfinite composition of cobase changes of horn inclusions
(without retracts involved).

* $Ex^\infty$ preserves all 5 classes of maps: [[weak equivalences]], (acyclic) [[cofibrations]], and (acyclic) [[fibrations]], as well as strong anodyne extensions and simplicial homotopy equivalences.

* $Ex^\infty$ preserves [[finite limits]] and [[filtered colimits]].

* $Ex^\infty(f)$ is a simplicial homotopy equivalence
if and only if $f$ is a simplicial weak equivalence.
