## Idea

The _Blakers-Massey theorem_ in the [[homotopy theory]] of pointed spaces is concerned with describing algebraically the first obstruction to [[excision]] for relative [[homotopy groups]]. There is also a weaker version just describing vanishing conditions which should be called the _Blakers-Massey connectivity theorem_. 

## Statement

### Traditional

This [[obstruction]] is measured by triad homotopy groups $\pi_m(X:A,B)$ for a pointed space $X$ with two subspaces $A,B$ each containing the base point. Here the group structure is defined for $m \geq 3$ and is abelian for $m \geq 4$. There is an exact sequence 

$$\cdots \to \pi_{n+1}(X;A,B) \to \pi_n (A, A \cap B) \to^{\epsilon} \pi_n( X,B) \to \pi_n(X;A,B) \to \cdots  $$
where $\epsilon$ is the excision map. The main result of Blakers and Massey is as follows:

###### Theorem

Suppose the triad **X** $ =(X;A,B)$ is such that: (i) the interiors of $A,B$ cover $X$; (ii) that $A,B$ and $C=A \cap B$ are connected; (iii) that $C$ is simply connected; (iv) and that $(A,C)$ is $(m-1)$-connected and $(B,C)$ is $(n-1)$-connected, $m,n \geq 3$. Then **X**$=(X;A,B)$ is $(m+n-2)$-connected and if $C$ is simply connected then the morphism given by the generalised Whitehead product
$$ \pi_{m}(A,C) \otimes \pi_{n}(B,C) \to \pi_{m+n-1}(X;A,B)$$
_is an isomorphism_.

###### Remark

A more intrinsic statement in the language of [[homotopy theory]] of the connectivity part of the theorem is that for $f_1$ and $f_2$ two [[maps]] out of the same [[domain]] which are $n_1$-[[n-connected morphism|connective]] and $n_2$-connective, respectively, then the canonical map from that domain into the [[homotopy pullback]] of their [[homotopy pushout]]

$$
  \array{
    X &\stackrel{f_1}{\longrightarrow}& Y_1
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f_2}} & \searrow
    \\
    Y_2 && Y_2 \underset{Y_2 \underset{X}{\coprod} Y_1}{\times} Y_1
  }
$$

is $(n_1 + n_2 - 1)$-[[n-connected morphism|connective]].

###### Remark

For the special case that $Y_1 \simeq Y_2 \simeq \ast$ are point contractible, the Blakers-Massey theorem reduces to the [[Freudenthal suspension theorem]].

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Since the tensor product is zero if one of its factors is zero, this result also gives criteria for the excision morphism $\epsilon$ to be an isomorphism in a certain range of dimensions. For this reason the excision consequences of that sequence are  also  called the _excision theorem of Blakers and Massey_ and have been given quite separate proofs for example in ([Hatcher](#Hatcher)), and in ([tom Dieck](#tomDiek08)). The  first non zero triad homotopy group is also called the _critical group_. Note that in _algebraic topology_ one wants _algebraic_ results, not just connectivity results.

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

A natural question is what happens if the conditions  that $m,n \geq 3$ and $C$ simply connected are weakened.   For example in the case $m=n=2$  we have the additional structure that the morphisms $\pi_2(A,C) \to \pi_1(C), \pi_2(B,C) \to \pi_1(C)$ are crossed modules, and so the required relative homotopy groups are in general nonabelian. If $m \geq 3 ,n \geq 3$ then $\pi_m(A,C), \pi_n(B,C)$ are still $\pi_1(C)$-modules.


The extension to the non simply connected case was given by Brown and Loday; one simply replaces the usual tensor product by the nonabelian tensor product of groups which act on each other and on themselves by conjugation. This result is a special case of a Seifert-van Kampen Theorem for $n$-cubes of spaces. Notice that the assumption (i) of the theorem is reminiscent of such a type of theorem. The useful fact is that one gets such a theorem for a certain kind of _structured space_ which allows for the development of algebraic structures which have structures in a range of dimensions.

Thus one of the intuitions is that the Blakers-Massey Theorem, and hence also the FST,  is of the Seifert-van Kampen type, since we are assuming that $X$ is the union of the interiors of $A,B$.

### In higher topos theory

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The Blakers-Massey connectivity theorem in the form of remark \ref{InTermsOfPushouts} holds in every [[(∞,1)-topos]] of [[(∞,1)-sheaves]].

=--

This is shown in ([Rezk 10, prop. 816](#Rezk10)) with reference to [[(∞,1)-sites]].
An intrinsic proof in [[homotopy type theory]] is announced in ([HoTTBook, theorem 8.10.2](#HoTTBook), [Lumsdaine-Finster-Licata 13](#LumsdaineFinsterLicata13)). The fully formal computer-checked version of this proof appears as HoTT-[[Agda]] code in ([Favonia 14](#Favonia)).

This translates to an [[internal language]] proof of Blakers-Massey valid in all [[(∞,1)-toposes]] (including [[elementary (∞,1)-toposes]]). Unwinding of the fully formal HoTT proof to ordinary mathematical language is, for the special case of the Freudenthal suspension theorem, in ([Rezk 14](#Rezk14)).

The following paper  applies the methods of the above two Brown-Loday papers to the well known problem of $n$-ad connectivity and to determination of the critical group, see Theorem 3.8 of:

The methods work because of their equivalence between cat$^n$-groups and crossed $n$-cubes of groups. This can be explained by saying that we need two kinds of algebraic categories for calculations with $(n+1)$-types: _broad_ categories for conjecturing and proving theorems, and _narrow_ algebraic categories for calculations and relations with classical ideas. In this case the broad category is that of cat$^n$-groups, and the narrow category is that of crossed $n$-cubes of groups, which are related geometrically to the homotopy groups of $r$-ads and to generalised Whitehead products. The tricky equivalence between the two kinds of categories is one of the engines behind the results, since it enables the use of whichever category is most convenient at any given time. Note also these two categories model weak, pointed, homotopy $(n+1)$-types, as shown by Loday in his paper

)):

 One such result, the Blakers-Massey connectivity theorem, is of particular interest in that all classical proofs use some specifics of their settings (usually, $Top$ or $SSet$) not available to us; so the type-theoretic proof was, by necessity, new in parts. This allowed us, as a by-product, to translate the proof back into classical language and obtain the theorem in wider generality than was previously known: we show that it holds in any infinity-topos (in the sense of Lurie). I will introduce the Blakers-Massey theorem and our approach to it, and discuss the process of translating a type-theoretic proof into infinity-categorical language.
