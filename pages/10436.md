## Idea

The _Blakers-Massey theorem_ in [[homotopy theory]] states that for $f_1$ and $f_2$ two [[maps]] out of the same [[codomain]] which are $n_1$-[[n-connected morphism|connective]] and $n_2$-connective, respectively, then the canonical map from the [[codomain]] into the [[homotopy pullback]] of their [[homotopy pushout]]

$$
  \array{
    X &\stackrel{f_1}{\longrightarrow}& Y_1
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f_2}} & \searrow
    \\
    Y_2 && Y_2 \underset{Y_2 \underset{X}{\coprod} Y_1}{\times} Y_1
  }
$$

is $(n_1 + n_2 - 1)$-[[n-connected morphism|connective]].

In the original statement of the theorem ([Blakers-Massey 51](#BlakersMassey51)) this was considered for the [[homotopy theory]] of [[topological spaces]], hence for [[homotopy types]]/[[∞-groupoids]] ´but the statement holds true in all [[(∞,1)-toposes]] (Rezk) and in fact in [[homotopy type theory]] ([Lumsdaine-Finster-Licata 13](#LumsdaineFinsterLicata13)), hence also for "[[geometric homotopy types]]".

For the special case that $Y_1 \simeq Y_2 \simeq \ast$ are point contractible, the Blakers-Massey theorem reduces to the [[Freudenthal suspension theorem]].
