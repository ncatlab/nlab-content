## Idea

The _Blakers-Massey theorem_ in the [[homotopy theory]] of spaces is concerned with describing algebraically the first obstruction to [[excision]] for relative [[homotopy groups]]. 

## Statement

This [[obstruction]] is measured by triad homotopy groups $\pi_m(X:A,B)$ for a pointed space $X$ with two subspaces $A,B$ each containing the base point. Here the group structure is defined for $m \geq 3$ and is abelian for $m \geq 4$. There is an exact sequence 

$$\cdots \to \pi_{n+1}(X;A,B) \to \pi_n (A, A \cap B) \to^{\epsilon} \pi_n( X,B) \to \pi_n(X;A,B) \to \cdots  $$
where $\epsilon$ is the excision map. The main result of Blakers and Massey is as follows:

###### Theorem

Suppose the triad **X** $ =(X;A,B)$ is such that: (i) the interiors of $A,B$ cover $X$; (ii) that $A,B$ and $C=A \cap B$ are connected; (iii) that $C$ is simply connected; (iv) and that $(A,C)$ is $(m-1)$-connected and $(B,C)$ is $(n-1)$-connected, $m,n \geq 3$. Then **X**$=(X;A,B)$ is $(m+n-2)$-connected and if $C$ is simply connected then the morphism given by the generalised Whitehead product
$$ \pi_{m}(A,C) \otimes \pi_{n}(B,C) \to \pi_{m+n-1}(X;A,B)$$
_is an isomorphism_.

###### Remark

A more intrinsic statement in the language of [[homotopy theory]] of the connectivity part of the theorem is that for $f_1$ and $f_2$ two [[maps]] out of the same [[codomain]] which are $n_1$-[[n-connected morphism|connective]] and $n_2$-connective, respectively, then the canonical map from the [[codomain]] into the [[homotopy pullback]] of their [[homotopy pushout]]

$$
  \array{
    X &\stackrel{f_1}{\longrightarrow}& Y_1
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f_2}} & \searrow
    \\
    Y_2 && Y_2 \underset{Y_2 \underset{X}{\coprod} Y_1}{\times} Y_1
  }
$$

is $(n_1 + n_2 - 1)$-[[n-connected morphism|connective]].


In the original connectivity statement of the theorem ([Blakers-Massey 51](#BlakersMassey51)) this was considered for the [[homotopy theory]] of [[topological spaces]], hence for "bare" [[homotopy types]]/[[∞-groupoids]] but the statement holds true in all [[(∞,1)-toposes]] ([[Charles Rezk]]) and in fact in [[homotopy type theory]] ([HoTTBook, theorem 8.10.2](#HoTTBook), [Lumsdaine-Finster-Licata 13](#LumsdaineFinsterLicata13)), hence also for "[[geometric homotopy types]]".

###### Remark

For the special case that $Y_1 \simeq Y_2 \simeq \ast$ are point contractible, the Blakers-Massey theorem reduces to the [[Freudenthal suspension theorem]].

###### Remark

Since the tensor product is zero if one of its factors is zero, this result also gives criteria for the excision morphism $\epsilon$ to be an isomorphism in a certain range of dimensions. For this reason the excision consequences of that sequence are  also  called the _excision theorem of Blakers and Massey_ and have been given quite separate proofs for example in ([Hatcher](#Hatcher)), and in ([tom Dieck](#tomDiek08)). The  first non zero triad homotopy group is also called the _critical group_. Note that in _algebraic topology_ one wants _algebraic_ results, not just connectivity results.

### Generalizations

The natural question is what happens if the conditions  that $m,n \geq 3$ and $C$ simply connected are weakened.   For example in the case $m=n=2$  we have the additional structure that the morphisms $\pi_2(A,C) \to \pi_1(C), \pi_2(B,C) \to \pi_1(C)$ are crossed modules, and so the required relative homotopy groups are in general nonabelian. If $m \geq 3 ,n \geq 3$ then $\pi_m(A,C), \pi_n(B,C)$ are still $\pi_1(C)$-modules.


The extension to the non simply connected case was given by Brown and Loday; one simply replaces the usual tensor product by the nonabelian tensor product of groups which act on each other and on themselves by conjugation. This result is a special case of Seifert-van Kampen Theorem for $n$-cubes of spaces. Notice that the assumption (i) of the theorem is reminiscent of such a type of theorem. The useful fact is that one gets such a theorem for a certain kind of _structured space_ which allows for the development of algebraic structures which have structures in a range of dimensions.

Thus one of the intuitions is that the Blakers-Massey Theorem, and hence also the FST,  is of the Seifert-van Kampen type, since we are assuming that $X$ is the union of the interiors of $A,B$.
