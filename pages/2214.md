## 2009-09-10

* [[Mike Shulman]]: Started trying to incorporate the results of the discussion into the entry at [[lax natural transformation]]. (Thanks very much -- _Todd_)

* [[Todd Trimble]]: commented at [[lax natural transformation]], and suggested a possible compromise at [[graph theory]] which I hope will be considered satisfying to all concerned. Thanks to Mike for creating [[icon]]. 

  * Created a stub for [[elliptic curve]], in response to Urs. 

* [[Urs Schreiber]] slightly edited [[A Survey of Elliptic Cohomology - formal groups and cohomology]] and added plenty of links 

* [[Toby Bartels]]:  More at [[graph]] and [[center]], since there is no [RSS feed](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Vanilla/nForum/comments.php?DiscussionID=64).

* [[Jon Awbrey]] is leaving the fray at _The World According To [[graph|Graph]]_ --- which is clearly becoming more "productive" than "creative" --- and suggests, as an interim measure, that he be allowed to store a few standard definitions at [[graph theory]].

* [[Mike Shulman]]: Replied at [[center]] and [[lax natural transformation]], and created [[icon]].

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  Thanks to David below!  I have moved [[barycentric algebra]] to [[convex space]] after being more sure that this name is not already taken (but 'convex set' does conflict).  Since the concept has been invented many times and has many names, let\'s use our own, which is a nice one.  I forgot about the blog discussion before; I had a nagging feeling that this had come up once and I hadn\'t gotten around to commenting then, so I\'m glad that David remembered.

*  [[Ryan Grady]] has given us [[A Survey of Elliptic Cohomology - formal groups and cohomology]]

* [[Todd Trimble]]: Finally got around to replying to [[Mike Shulman]] over at [[lax natural transformation]], with some responses of Ross Street and Steve Lack. 

* [[Urs Schreiber]] started adding to [[infinitesimal object]] a discussion for how one can understand Lawvere's abstract definition intuitively as encoding infinitesimal extension. But am in a hurry and have to leave it unpolished for the moment.

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  Replies at [[barycentric algebra]], [[evil]], [[graph]], [[boolean domain]], [[center]].

   *  [[David Corfield]]: convex spaces and barycentric algebras cropped up [here](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/04/convex_spaces.html#c023763). I don't know if there's anything useful there.

* [[Jon Awbrey]]:  Further discussion and some data at [[graph]].

* [[Mike Shulman]]: Expanded a bunch at [[center]], and continued discussions at [[graph]] and [[evil]].


## 2009-09-09

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  More commentary at [[boolean domain]] and [[graph]].

* [[Todd Trimble]]: added still more to the long discussion at the bottom of [[graph]]. 

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  Created [[barycentric algebra]], mostly to explain the stuff about convex sets in the discussion at [[semicartesian monoidal category]].

* [[Urs Schreiber]]: motivated by [[Toby Bartels|Toby]]'s comment there I have now branched off the material at [[limits and colimits by example]] that describes a computer program to [[Paine on a Category Theory Demonstrations program]]. This is now linked to there from the section "Further resources". I have moved the pertaining discussion boxes to the bottom of the entry. 

* [[Jon Awbrey]]: Piecewise discussion at [[boolean domain]], but it will be later before I can get to the rest of the pieces.

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  Discussions at [[center]], [[evil]], [[graph]], [[boolean domain]], [[limits and colimits by example]], [[semicartesian monoidal category]].

* [[Mike Shulman]]: 

  * I have a different opinion about the [[center]] of a set.
  * Discussions at [[evil]], [[graph]], and [[boolean domain]].

* [[Jon Awbrey]]:  Continuing discussion at [[graph]].  I won't try to note each entry here, unless that's the rule.

* [[Jon Awbrey]]:  I added an Idea section to [[relation theory]] with what I can recall of how I got into that.  Incidentally, the x-tended code for the amphora symbol (@) now causes Ruby to go off the Rails, so I had to use \text{@} instead.

* [[Urs Schreiber]]: thanks, once more, to [[Todd Trimble|Todd]], for the discussion of monadicity et al at [[limits and colimits by example]]. We should eventually brach that kind of discussion off into an entry in its own right and expand

* [[Jon Awbrey]] entered the fray of discussion at [[graph]].

* [[Todd Trimble]]: Per Urs's request below, I checked the limits in under-category he wrote, and added a remark at the end. 

* [[Zoran Škoda]]: last night my battery bailed out when I was editing several entries so did not log what I have done. Now I do not recall all entries which I updated, except that I created [[deformation theory]] (so far only references and links), expanded [[derived algebraic geometry]], added a reference to [[formal group]] and to [[quasicoherent sheaves]]. I thank lab elf for cograts for my entry 2000 which was however [[Grothendieck connection]] where I also made a small change last night (when saying $n$-costratification, $n$ refers to work with $n$-th infinitesimal neighborhood and not with $n$-categorical descent: the descent data were in Grothendieck 1-descent data). Today we have an excursion during the conference in Sevilla, so I will probably not be able to continue (have much to add to [[deformation theory]] etc.). 

* [[Urs Schreiber]]

  * added a section on limits in under categories to [[limits and colimits by example]] and a detailed proof of how they are computed by limits in the underlying category -- please check

  * added a linked table of contents at [[limits and colimits by example]]

  * added a query box at [[limits and colimits by example]] in the section titled "for programmers". I am suggesting that since the material doesn't actually use a computer program to explain limits and colimits but instead explains how to write such a computer program, the material should be moved elsewhere. 

  * added an "Idea" section to [[n-localic (infinity,1)-topos]]

  * slightly expanded the remark under "Generalizations" at [[localic topos]], trying to indicate the pattern

* [[Urs Schreiber]]: re Toby's remark below: 

  yes, true,  the $(\infty,1)$-topos material is "Grothendieck-Rezk-Lurie $(\infty,1)$-toposes of $(\infty,1)$-sheaves". If it weren't so cumbersome to say this, one should make this explicit more often. But maybe we should highlight it at least more at beginning of entries. 

  Another thing I noticed that maybe requires more emphasis is that the $\infty$-stack-$(\infty,1)$-toposes that one gets from the standard [[models for infinity-stack (infinity,1)-toposes]] are far from being the generic case. Many Grothendieck-Rezk-Lurie $(\infty,1)$-toposes are not equivalent to these. (Compare Lurie's discussion of [[topological localization]], [[hypercompletion]], [[n-localic (infinity,1)-topos]]es, etc.)

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  I moved [[free field (algebra)]] to [[free field]] on the grounds that (as with [[field]] itself) the algebraic mathematical meaning is likely to be our default here.  But I might be wrong.  In a similar vein, I suggested [[physical field]] at [[field]].

* [[Jon Awbrey]] made some attempt to reorganize the discussion at [[boolean domain]].  This is one of my main stepping stones, so I'll need to keep the algæ at a minimum.

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:
   *  The centre of a set at [[center]].
   *  The Hahn--Banach Theorem for separable spaces at [[locally convex space]].
   *  A note about the meanings of 'convex set' at [[semicartesian monoidal category]].
   *  Physics notation at [[Weyl algebra]].


## 2009-09-08

* [[Jon Awbrey]] finished up the basic definitions and expository examples at [[sign relation]].

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  I do enjoy it, Urs!  But remember that, for Lurie, an ‘$\infty$-topos’ is not only an $(\infty,1)$-topos but in fact a *Grothendieck* $(\infty,1)$-topos.  So when he says that a ‘$0$-topos’ is a locale, he similarly means that a *Grothendieck* $(0,1)$-topos is a locale.  (An *elementary* $(0,1)$-topos is a [[Heyting algebra]].)  I also wrote [[(0,1)-category]], since you linked it; that\'s a p(r)oset.

* [[Urs Schreiber]]

  * quick unformatted content filled in at [[n-localic (infinity,1)-topos]], to be continued later, have to run now...

  * created stub for [[(0,1)-topos]], linked to it from [[locale]] with a small comment -- Toby might enjoy that -- this mainly to remind me to extract the essentce from section 6.4.2 in [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT]] later. Will also create [[(n,1)-topos]] then

  * thanks to Todd for expanding at [[localic topos]]!

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  More at [[evil]]; we might actually be working out some mathematical facts here before too long!

   * [[Jon Awbrey]]:  I wouldn't _count_ on it &mdash; cuz, y'know, that might be _evil_.

* [[Todd Trimble]] added some more to [[localic topos]]. 

* [[Jon Awbrey]] added a bit more content to [[sign relation]] and then broke for lunch.  ($n$-tweet?)

* [[Urs Schreiber]] 

  * created stubs for [[localic topos]] and [[n-localic (∞,1)-topos]]

  * added to [[Deligne-Mumford stack]] the alternative characterization as a 1-localic $G$-[[generalized scheme]] for $G$ the _etale geometry_ (defined there). Also added a brief "Idea"-section

  * created [[affine scheme]]

  * created _topic cluster floating table of contents_ [[(infinity,1)-topos - contents]] and included it in the linked entries

  * created [[object classifier]] and linked to it from [[(∞,1)-topos]] and [[Higher Topos Theory]] and [[subobject classifier]]

  * slightly reorganized and then expanded the _topic cluster_ floating table of contents [[cohomology - contents]]. in that context I

    * created [[orientation]], [[Spin structure]], [[Fivebrane structure]] and slightly expanded [[String structure]]

    * briefly discussed/mentioned these in the examples section at [[quantum anomaly]]

    * and on that occasion created an entry for [[Ulrich Bunke]] whose recent article (yesterday!) I cite above, where he makes the old Killingback argument about how a String-structure makes the worldvolume anomaly of the heterotic string vanish rigorous

  * corrected the mistake at [[rational topological space]] that [[David Corfield]] spotted below

  * added to [[CW complex]] link to [[geometric realization]] 
 
  * started [[rational topological space]]

     * [[David Corfield]]: Asked question there.

* [[Jon Awbrey]] added content to [[semiotic equivalence relation]].

* [[Mike Shulman]]:

  * More discussion at [[evil]].
  * Started some work on clarifying definitions at [[graph]].
  * Spoke up in defense of the adverb at [[locally presentable category]].

* [[Jon Awbrey]]:  Clarifying at [[graph theory]] and questying at [[evil]].


## 2009-09-07

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  Replies to Mike at [[evil]] and [[graph]].

* [[Mike Shulman]]:

  * Started a discussion -- at [[graph]] -- about what may be wrong with that page and how to fix it.  I think that a page called [[graph theory]] should be more like the pages called [[topology]] and [[category theory]].
  * Comments at [[evil]].

* [[Urs Schreiber]]: 

  * missed one train. Used the few minutes gained this way to quickly extract the following very brief entries from the notes mentioned below: [[multiplicative cohomology theory]], [[even cohomology theory]], [[periodic cohomology theory]], [[Bott element]] -- all these entries deserve to be greatly expanded, it particular by eyxamples, of course, but it should be a start

  * started turning some talk notes of a seminar into entries, but requires polishing: 

    the full raw material is at [[A Survey of Elliptic Cohomology - cohomology theories]]. Using this I have so far split off [[cohomology theory]], [[Lazard ring]], [[complex cobordism cohomology theory]] and [[reduced cohomology]]

  * wrote a somewhat revisionist "Idea" section at [[Grothendieck connection]]. Notice that it is in particular the Breen-Messing reference cited and discussed at [[infinitesimal singular simplicial complex]] that allows me to do that! (meaning: I am not making this up, but just putting the pieces together)

* [[Jon Awbrey]] added a page on [[graph theory]].  The page on [[graph]] has become too baroque to fix, but there needs to be a place to record the basic definitions of graph theory that are actually used by the larger schools of math folks who actually dare to call themselves graph theorists.  This is stuff that is more in the back of my mind than the forefront of my attention, so I'll add to it over time as other work recurs to it.

* [[Rafael Borowiecki]]: Replied Todd Trimbles question at [[Timeline of category theory and related mathematics]].

  * [[Todd Trimble|Todd]] replied back. 

* [[Urs Schreiber]] started keyword-list entry [[Structured Spaces]] and in that context also started [[generalized scheme]]

* [[Andrew Stacey|Lab Elf (numerological department)]]: Just thought I'd congratulate Zoran on creating the 2000th page on the nLab.  According to the database, it was [[smooth morphism of schemes]].  For those who prefer other coincidences, [[skewfield]] was our 2009th.  Of course, in this more modern age we ought to really celebrate [[coherent sheaf]] instead.  Whichever we celebrated, it would be Zoran that would get the metaphorical bottle of champagne as he created the lot.

* [[Urs Schreiber]] 

  * changed the coding of the floating table of contents [[cohomology - contents]] according to the recent discussion on the forum and added a few recent entries to it

  * slightly expanded [[integral cohomology]]

  * added a web reference by [[Nora Ganter]] (created stub fo that) on [[topological modular form]]s (created stub for that) kindly pointed out by [[David Roberts]] to [[A Survey of Elliptic Cohomology]] and to [[tmf]]

  * it seems that yesterday I also created [[stable homotopy theory]]

* [[Jon Awbrey]] added an epigraph to [[evil]].


## 2009-09-06

* [[Mike Shulman]]:

  * Created [[single-sorted definition of a category]] and [[collection]].  Afterwards I had the thought that perhaps the former should be called something more like "category (single-sorted definition)" -- any thoughts?  Do we have a convention for this sort of thing yet?
  * Asked a question at [[Categories Work]].

* [[Todd Trimble]]: responded to something Rafael wrote at [[category theory]], and asked a question at the bottom of the timeline page. 

* [[Urs Schreiber]]

  * created [[derived algebraic geometry]]

  * wrote a bit of summary at [[A Survey of Elliptic Cohomology]]

  * started [[elliptic cohomology]]

    so far with quick stubs for [[line bundle]], [[cohomology ring]]

  * expanded the content at [[Jacob Lurie]], fixed the links and added [[A Survey of Elliptic Cohomology]]

  * merged the former material at [[∞-topos]] with that at [[higher topos theory]] and expanded and slightly rearranged the latter. 

  * coded the "floating tables of contents" for the topic clusters at [[mathematics]] and [[rational homotopy theory]] according to [[Andrew Stacey]]'s suggestion on the nForum -- see [here](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Vanilla/nForum/comments.php?DiscussionID=61&page=1#Comment_743)

* [[Rafael Borowiecki]]:

  * Replied at [[category theory]].

  * Wrote a little more on [[extended topological quantum field theory]] but don't know the right references. Put that request in a query box.

  * Debate at the timeline.


## 2009-09-05

*  Note spelling:  [[Saunders Mac Lane]].

* [[Zoran Škoda]] inserted and reminded of work of Rezk and Toën-Vezzosi on [[higher topos theory]] preceding the marvelous [[Higher Topos Theory|Lurie's work]].

* [[Andrew Stacey]]: without wishing to join in the fascinating debate as to whether the timeline should be kept in sync with Wikipedia, I'd just like to expand on my comment about asking the question on the forum.  The specific question on timeline is technical in nature ("how do I deal with 1500 links?") and therefore most likely to be answered by one of the more technically minded people here.  Some of those people do check every page on the lab for every revision, but others don't.  However, they do check this page and they tend to check the forum as well.  The best way to get your question seen is to put a brief note here and link it to a discussion on the forum.  Also, the more detailed and precise you can make your question, the easier it is to understand and to answer and therefore the more likely it is to get an answer.

* [[Urs Schreiber]] 

  * created a stub entry for [[Samuel Eilenberg]] and put hyperlinks under the names of Eilenberg and MacLane at [[category theory]].

  * expanded at [[infinity-stack]] the first paragraph of the "Definition" section and added a link to [[sheaf of n-types]].

  * created [[sheaf of n-types]] which was requested in the "Timeline" entry. But I made this essentially just a commented redirect to [[∞-stack]], because it's just another word for that.

  * expanded the introduction of [[AKSZ theory]] a little, added the original reference and linked Kontsevich's name there to the new entry on [[Maxim Kontsevich]] and  added a paragraph that tries to briefly put this in context with related existing nLab entries. But the entry is still missing a discussion  of its subject itself. I have some old blog material on this, but this deserves more spare time than I have at the moment.

  * added links back and forth between the new [[higher topos theory]] and the old [[∞-topos]]. Probably some reorganization of the material over these two entries would eventually be reasonable.

  * added plenty of hyperlinks to the entry on [[Maxim Kontsevich]] -- many of them point to existing nLab entries, many others point to nLab entries still to be created (and lots of them would be highly desireable)

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  Created a stub [[higher topos theory]] (not to be confused with [[Higher Topos Theory]]).

* [[Benoit Jubin]]: asked a question at [[monoidal category]] about the necessity of requiring $\lambda_1=\rho_1$.

  * [[Todd Trimble]] responded. 


## 2009-09-04

*  [[Tim Porter]]:  On the issue of stacks,  Deligne and Mumford explicitly (p. 97 of their famous paper) use the term 'stack' as an English translation of 'Champ' and attribute that to Giraud in _Cohomologie non-abelienne_. This latter source was published later than Deligne and Mumford's paper but is refered to by them as 'University of Columbia'. Giraud was a student of Grothendieck.
 
* [[Zoran Škoda]]: surely Grothendieck invented stacks in general categorical sense and had a picture in various setups; Deligne and Mumford did invent a particular kind of [[algebraic stack]] and tailored it toward a very specific application. 

* [[Rafael Borowiecki]]: 

  * I was before talking about edit 143 of the timeline by Toby Bartels. I am now trying to figure out what it changed. The other edits i understand.

  * Added a query box at [[Timeline of category theory and related mathematics]] to hear what others think about the first entry in the timeline regarding Cayleys paper.

  * I must correct you Zoran at a point. I never said the entry must look good but i want the timeline to look good. This means links, easy to read, no stuff that should not be there and it should of course be correct. Those who know the years,names and category theory would see if it was not correct and say it looks bad.

  * Since we are on the subject history. I Credited Deligne-Mumford for inventing stacks. But i recall rumours that it was Grothendieck that invented stacks, without any references.

* [[Zoran Škoda]]: added redirects and a reference to [[quasicoherent sheaf]]; expanded [[representation theory]]; created [[EGA]] (just an introduction to the entry, links and toc missing); created [[orbit]] wanted by [[coadjoint orbit]]; more importantly for the present needs, wrote [[Grothendieck connection]] (entry 2000 :)), required both by the timeline and by the current interests of the project pushed by Urs which I try to help and discuss; and it also refers to some things I was many time mentioning (and even to some ideas behind my preprint on cyclic comonads and related papers by Menini-Stefan and Böhm-Stefan). Wrote [[Poisson manifold]] and [[coadjoint orbit]] (unfinished). 
No, Rafael, I was not trying to find oldest instance of category theory. But Hilbert's first entry and also things about Whitehead etc. nonabelian invariants require the earlier appearances of such ideas if they existed. Look, the main theorem of Cayley in modern language says that the resultant of polynomials is a determinant of certain Koszul complex. As far as Galois, I think it should absolutely be in timeline, definitely, not only because of the notion of the group, but in fact Galois theory itself is in a spirit and a stimulus of much of the modern category theory -- torsors, Grothendieck Galois theory, equivariant descent, Galois descent, Joyal-Tierney, Hopf-Galois to mention a few (On the other hand, the notion of an abelian group is essentially in Gauss' Disquisitiones Arithmeticae in pretty clean form, according to my friends who read it carefully; I can not judge). The Klein's Erlangen program is a related ideological item, but more disputable.  I still do not understand what do you mean by that moving again the wikipedia and overwriting $n$lab version depends on ability to do links. If you change links to wikipedia somehow automatically to the format which finds the true wikipedia pages this will be good for most of the items, but wrong for those few items where we already do have nlab entries. So it is a problem of selection.

* [[Rafael Borowiecki]]: When i was writing i once by accident updated the timeline at wikipedia and undid the change. If you look at it from the history you will see that i have corrected some of what you wrote and i will with interest look at the rest. I find the dates usually on internet which mean they could be wrong. I did not include Poincares Analysis situs for progress on group theory but topology which is one of the related themes of the timeline. As for Cayleys paper i would like to hear what others think. But it looks to me you tried to find the earliest possible instance of category theory. Then Galois theory is earlier. I think of it of course as a precursor to modern Galois theory but did not include it. 

* [[Toby Bartels]]:  I have some opinions on the [[Timeline of category theory and related mathematics]], which I will put *there* where they belong.

* [[Zoran Skoda]]: created an entry on [[Maxim Kontsevich]] as his name is quoted in timeline and some other places in nlab.

* [[Zoran Skoda]]: The same way one could say that Poincare's papers done nothing on group theory. He does many things about groups completely in the language of manifolds, but in fact he proves the theorems on fundamental group, and these were transferred to group theory later. The homological algebra of Hilbert is equally linear algebra as is homological algebra of Cayley. Cohomologies in different language were used extensively by early Italian school of algebraic geometry; ask Japanese algebraic geometer Mukai to explain the 1899 paper (I think) of Castelnuovo with Castelnuovo's arguments literally, just with modern names for the quantities (it is all about cohomologies). I do not know why do you care that the entry LOOKS GOOD. I think it would be more important to be CORRECT, I listed once several instances of suspicious dates, and nobody cares about what is more important than syncing. To add new ones it is NOT true that localization is a special case of descent as it says in 1960 entry on descent within wikipedia timeline version; surely localization and descent can be combined in very nice ways, or sometimes phrased in the same language but the descent is descent and the localization is localization. Well descent data and the localized category can be both made comodules or modules over some comonad or a monad but this is a different issue and neither is special case of another. Rosenberg's proof of the reconstruction of scheme is not written first time in the 1998 paperon nc schemes, that paper has just appendix with a SKETCH of the proof which is in its full version in his earlier 1996 Max Planck Bonn preprint ([pdf](http://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/preprints/send?bid=3948)), some form of which is published in another journal also in 1998, with submission January 1997; in any case it is a different paper than [[noncommutative scheme]] paper. Similarly, 
1960 date for Grothendieck's [[formal schemes]] is wrong, as the Bourbaki seminar paper for 1958/1959 is having a full article with already deep results (like Grothendieck existence theorem) on the subject. Look bibliography to [[formal scheme]]. 1960 for descent theory may also be too late though I am not sure at the moment, I am almost sure that one of the parts of FGA for descent has been published before 1960; just look for FGA (probably in Vistoli's survey you can find the year for the reference). For triangulated categories one should list (unlike wikipedia version of timeline) not only Verdier but also Grothendieck who was the true discoverer (and gave the list of chapters and main theorems to Verdier to prove and write up,a s he was usually doing with his students). You see these complaints I wrote only after 2 minutes of looking superficially at several lines of timeline. The timeline needs tens of such corrections historically and not the syncing,colors and look. 

* [[Rafael Borowiecki]]: Zoran, the migration will ultimately depend on if i am able to do the linking. I could completely not care about the nLab timeline but i want it to look good. The long entries will be as short/long as they are now. I will try not to loose anything and discuss the entries i would remove. [AST](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/algebraic+set+theory) alteady exist as do pages for the other long entries. Regarding Cayley i have seen the paper long before and have it on my computer. Cayley calculates invariant theory in coordinates. The paper do not define any categorical concept or prove a categorical theorem. Nor do it introduce any method used later in category theory, it is just polynomial algebra. I would say it don't start homological algebra. You could put it as that it anticipated homological algebra but i don't think Cayley thought about this paper that abstractly.

* [[Zoran Škoda]]: Rafael, when you opened timeline in nlab you did NOT tell us, the conditions/plan of syncing, which is fundamentally incompatible with nlab and wikipedia as each of them has limitations AND advantages. For example, we like book entries in nlab; timeline has some entries in the tabel very short, some hugely long: e.g. the wikipedia has huge entry of about alf a page on a book of Joyal and Moerdijk on algebraic sets. Why not have a separate entry in nlab for that book with all the material and in nlab entry for that book just say book  algebraic sets, yeas and that's it. Second new migration would take tens of hours of time to make links compatible with entries in nlab, some of which can not be automatic. How Cayley's paper benefited category theory ? Jee, you have tens of etries on homological algebra; including the Hilbert's which are about the SAME stuff, just much later. How do you expect a collaboration on an entry if you are going to just decide out of your taste what is important ? Even if we talk about papers which wree anticipating developments in other works by over half a century ? You are concerned about syncing and difficulties. There is a wikipedia and there is nlab. When it is easy to borrow and coopearte why not. When it is difficult and creates problem just the heck with it, let's develop aturally two versions. No sync...

* [[Rafael Borowiecki]]: Replied at the timeline of category theory. Zoran, my original plan was to have the timelines synced to optimize both timelines and i will try to do so. I will also try to have good links. Right now the wikipedia timeline contains almost all entries and information in the nLab timeline and very much more. So at the moment it would be nLab that benefits most. I will look into your changes once again and try to keep them. It is easier to only copy the links than to find them. You have not seen the new version but, as for Cayley i just don't see how his calculation benefited category theory so i removed it, but this is a discussion for the timeline page. I also recall removing the deRham theorem since it don't really fit with the structure of the timeline. I have not included dualities. But this one i can change back since it was a very important discovery about cohomology and there are no rules to follow any structure. I will check more now. Then i wish people added so much to the timelines it would be impractical to sync them. Now that nLab is fast enough it should go much better to edit the links.

* [[Zoran Škoda]]: created [[internal relation]]. I was once working on replacing tens (and spend hours on this) of wikipedia links in timeline with our own links, and even created new entries in nlab to support the new links in nlab. For example I created the entry for [[Otto Schreier]] in nlab to support the quotation for Schreier in nlab version of Timeline. I also do not understand why things like the Cayley 1843 entry are ignored (and hence will disappear in new migration); I spent hours of time looking into references which I recalled vaguely to confirm what I thought about it. I see no reason for wikipedia to overwrite our work  on changes. 80 links changed in single day is possible done by me; I recall that I did work once on making many links either more functional (including making the blind link to wikipedia link) or update them with new biography entries in nlab. I would not say that in that particular day only the links changed.

* [[Jon Awbrey]] made a first pass at formatting [[Trimble on ETCS III]] and thinks to have earned himself a nice Labor Day vacation, so if it's messed up don't tell him till Tuesday.

* [[Rafael Borowiecki]]: Urs, i have taken care of that. I first updated the wikipedia timeline to match the nLab timeline. But a discussion might be at place since i have removed some of Zoran Škoda's entries. I was not able to see and do one change thought, there is one revision that changes something in most of the 80 first entries or so. Maybe only links. I only took a quick look, and i am now thinking about the link problem. I found nLabs way of comparing revisions often very hard to read. I think it colors much more than need to be.

* [[Zoran Škoda]]: oops, the link to Cartan Seminar at numdam was one char too long at Timeline; sorry. Regarding that the nlab has both different rules, format, link capacity, side resources etc. than wikipedia, that after so many updates are done in nlab version on our side, it woudl make no sense tooverwrite the nlab version of timeline with a new migration of wikipedia. One can update some particular items, but migrating it as a whole would mean relinking the part which is already relinked in nlab version. So, once the original bulk of timeline has once being moved the two timeline entries may live their separate lives and occasionally some individual additions or links could be manually added to borrow from nlab to wiki or other way around, by the criteria and will of nlab contributors while copying news to nlab and wikipedia contributors while copying news to wikipedia. It is too late to do bulk migration again; and wikipedia while better in some items, the nlab is better in some other additions to timeline which never made into wikipedia. Or I misunderstood something. I see no purpose into maintaining the two versions mutually equivalent; who wants to see another version can do this by clicking. The cooperation is rather to start the bulk and then to grow any way it likes. 

* [[Urs Schreiber]] -- question to [[Rafael Borowiecki]]: below you write

  > The same timeline at wikipedia has/will have soon about 1500 links. When i migrate it to nLab again, and better than the last time, i need to change the links

  What do you mean by "migrate"? The nLab version of the timeline has now many entries and edits that don't seem to be reflected in the Wikipedia version. No?

* [[Rafael Borowiecki]]: Replied to Zoran's question.

* [[Zoran Škoda]]: put a query into the [[Timeline of category theory and related mathematics|Timeline]] entry: at numdam one can find the Cartan Sem from 1948, but I can not find there the write up of sheaf theory those some related notions in non-sheaf language can be easily found. Am I blind ? [numdam 1948 Cartan Sem](http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/feuilleter?id=SHC_1948-1949__1_). Timeline claims 1948 WRITE-UP. So where it is ?

* [[Urs Schreiber]] 

  * slightly expanded [[Lie algebroid]] and added several links to entries that didn't exist back when this was created but do exist now

    in this context I made [[Atiyah Lie algebroid]] redirect to [[Atiyah Lie groupoid]]
 
  * created [[tangent Lie algebroid]]

* [[Rafael Borowiecki]]: 

  * The [[Timeline of category theory and related mathematics]] is repaired thanks to Andrew Stacey. See the new question there about updating links in a new migration.

  * Andrew, i am glad that you are interested in my big problem. But i don't really understand your question. Is it not enough to ask the question at the timeline page and say here that i have added a problem to solve to the page? Perhaps the question at the timeline was not clear. The same timeline at wikipedia has/will have soon about 1500 links. When i migrate it to nLab again, and better than the last time, i need to change the links to link to correct pages at nLab. It is only some of the names that need to be changed to link to correct nLabs pages, which often have different names than those in wikipedia.

* [[Zoran Škoda]]: created [[fibration of points]] following [[Borceux-Bourn]].

* [[Andrew Stacey]]: I have implemented all the little database tweaks that were needed and done my best to reverse all the truncations.  Please see [this comment](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Vanilla/nForum/comments.php?DiscussionID=52&page=2#Item_22) for details.  Please also check if a long page is how it ought to be (thinking particularly of the timeline).

   The main thing to note is that although the limits are larger and are sufficient to accommodate all that was on the old lab, _there are still limits_.  In particular, page names and redirects are limited to 100 characters.  Page contents is a little bigger!

   Talking of the timeline, incidentally, now that I can see Rafael's question, could I ask him to ask the question again over on the Forum with at the very least a link to where I can see what it is that needs to be converted?  Thanks.

* [[Zoran Škoda]]: additions to [[Ieke Moerdijk]]

* [[Tim Porter]]: I have removed the blue boxes as suggetsed by [[Urs]] (see below).

* [[Zoran Škoda]]: created the entry for the monograph [[Borceux-Bourn]] and extracted some material to add into [[Mal'cev category]]. Created [[Mal'cev variety]] including the definitions and redirects for [[Mal'cev operation]] and [[Mal'cev theory]]. 

* [[Urs Schreiber]]

  * created entries for [[Saunders MacLane]], [[Gonzalo Reyes]] and [[Ieke Moerdijk]] and included links to them where we cite these people as authors (but I will have missed many pages where we do)

  * am asking for discussion of my latest formatting decision concerning these floating tables of contents [here](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Vanilla/nForum/comments.php?DiscussionID=61) on the forum

  * expanded the entry [[dg-algebra]], moved the discussion there to the bottom, as I think it has been addressed (but Toby, let me know if not)

     I find it kind of a pity that this entry exists in parallel with [[differential graded algebra]]. I understand that the motivation was that one entry gives the detailed component description while the other gives the abstract nonsense definition (monoid in chain complexes). But this is a general effect in the nLab and we should keep such things in different subsections on the same page. Maybe let me know what you think

  * added floating table of contents to the "lexicon" entries on differential graded structures that [[Tim Porter]] created a while ago. See for instance starting at [[graded vector space]].

    (these tables overlap with Tim's blue alert boxes. I am thinking we could remove these boxes now and let the table of comntents server their purpose, but before i do this I want to hear what Tim thinks about. I'll contact him)

* [[Jon Awbrey]] made a first pass at formatting [[Trimble on ETCS II]], but it will need to be checked.

  * [[Urs Schreiber]]: thanks! That's very useful. i was hoping somebody would find the time to do that eventually. Great that you did it.


## 2009-09-03

* [[Todd Trimble]]: wrote article on [[tree]]. 

* [[Zoran Škoda]]: created [[formal group scheme]] also far from finished. Maybe [[John Baez|John]] would like to explain connections to the Witt ring ?

* [[Rafael Borowiecki]]: Wrote a hopefully not too long answer to the long discussion at [[category theory]].

* [[Zoran Škoda]]: created [[formal scheme]] but it is far from finished; small changes to few related items (e.g. [[Kähler differential]]). 

*  [[Benoit Jubin]] has kindly corrected some fonts at [[monoidal category]].  Welcome, Benoît!

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  Answered the open question at [[An Exercise in Kantization]].

   * [[Jon Awbrey]]:  "Kantization" makes it sound like you are talking about Immanuel Kant --- I think you should call it "Kanonization".

* [[Jon Awbrey]] added a stub-link at [[semiotic equivalence relation]] --- and I see by the clock on the [TARDIS Wall](http://nlab.mathforge.org/nlab/recently_revised) that the Synchronoplastic Infundibulum has hic$\cup\partial$.

* [[Zoran Škoda]]: added some references to [[supermanifold]]. I agree with Urs that the <em>co</em>-things when the entries contain predominantly the definitions and non-specific information should be just under the things. However often the cothings are very unlike things in practice. For example, homology and cohomology in abelian categories is just the same and dual; however in geometry homology and cohomology of spaces are rather different; for example there are finiteness conditions in homology which are absent in cohomology. Naively defined Čech cohomology is a cohomology theory and Čech homology is not, as it fails exactness...but the coherent repair works. Or the rings. Artinian and noetherian are dual conditions, but for unital rings the unit breaks the symmetry, hence every unital artinian ring is noetherian but not by far other way around. 

* [[lab elf|Lab Elf (Swiss department)]]: I _think_ I've fixed the timezone.  I guess the real test is when I submit this page.  Let's see now, it's about 12:50 UTC, so click 'Submit' and ... 12:51 is the reported time.  Yippee!

* [[Andrew Stacey]]: The memory upgrade has happened.  Our IP address has changed so if you can't access the nLab then you need to ... err ...

* [[Urs Schreiber]] made the following keywords all redirect to [[fibration sequence]]: [[cofibration sequence]], [[homotopy fiber]], [[homotopy cofiber]]

  (this is supposed to be in line with what I think is a general strategy we should stick to: that all co-things are discussed in the same entry with things, since otherwise we get huge and unreasonable duplication) 

* [[Zoran Škoda]]: created [[free field (algebra)]], [[perfect field]], [[algebraic group]]. 

* [[lab elf|Lab Elf (children's department)]]: We're getting a memory upgrade sometime soon.  This will involve a downtime of approximately 35-40 minutes (they have to shift our "slice" to another machine to accommodate the upgrade).  I don't know yet exactly when this will occur and I may not get notice in time to post it here (I've requested that it be ASAP).  For obvious reasons, if I do get notice of when it will be then I'll put an announcement on the Forum and somewhere appropriate on the Cafe (I guess the 'nLab migration' thread seems most suitable).

* [[Urs Schreiber]]: expanded [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]]

  * added table of contents to [[cohomology]] and strated adding to related entries

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  In answer to Jon Awbrey\'s question,
   >What day is it?
   it\'s still September 2 UTC, but for some reason the Lab is now on UTC+4, which makes it September 3.  Hopefully we can get it back to UTC, which is the standard for international sites; but if not, then I\'ll probably just edit the 'UTC' up above to 'UTC+4' and leave it at that.

   [[lab elf|Lab Elf (Swiss department)]]: On the TODO list ... Actually, maybe the TODO list ought to be a little more explicit.  I'll stick it on the forum.

* [[Jon Awbrey]] finished formatting [[triadic relation]].


## 2009-09-02

* [[Urs Schreiber]] tried to usefully rearrange the table of contents at [[HowTo]] into subsections a bit, just a suggestion, probably not optimal yet, but I felt the reader might wish to have an easier overview

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  Made a table of contents for [[HowTo]].

* [[Mike Shulman]]: A bit more on displaying MathML at [[HowTo]].

* [[Urs Schreiber]] 

  * expanded the beginning of [[extended topological quantum field theory]], also added further links to existing entries

  * further expanded [[equivariant cohomology]] a bit: made the essential idea a standout box and added group cohomology and local systems as examples.

* [[Rafael Borowiecki]]: 

  * Replied at [[Bousfield localization]].

  * Replied and did some minor changes on [[extended topological quantum field theory]]. I am waiting for the experts to improve what i have written before i write more. 

  * As for the timeline i am glad that it can be fixed but how about the long titles? Ah. the nForum.

* [[Urs Schreiber]]

  * started an entry on [[equivariant cohomology]]

  * I agree with Andrew: single long pages are not so good for the reader. An entry that becomes very long should be split into an overview page with a linked table of contents and sub-pages. We did this for instance for [[gerbe]].

  * added to [[HomePage]] and to [[HowTo]] a note on software prerequisites for displaying MathML. At [[HowTo]] this discussion should eventually be expanded.

  * I changed links throughout the Lab to the pages [[Chevalley-eilenberg algebra in synthetic differential geomet|Chevalley-eilenberg algebra in synthetic differential geometry]] and to [[Verity on descent for strict omega-groupoid valued presheave|Verity on descent for strict omega-groupoid valued presheaves]] to the new truncated title names, so that they will still work. There are more entries for which this is necessary. See the discussion at the forum.

* [[Andrew Stacey]] I've written enough on the Instiki/MediaWiki issues elsewhere and I'm not going to rehash them here (or even link to them).  In short: it ain't gonna happen.  The issues we're having is purely a matter of database differences - it's nothing to do with Instiki itself.  I doubt many people do a database migration - certainly none of the nonsense (abstract or otherwise) that I've read has mentioned the problems we've had - so the issues aren't well known.  I'm finding them out as we go along.  I apologise that it's a live test, but there were only three serious beta testers and they didn't pick up on all of these issues as there were only three of them.

  I don't know why splitting the timeline up wouldn't feel like 2009.  I think that _long_ pages are a hangover from the _old days_.  We should have shorter pages included in to bigger pages (which, incidentally, is what MediaWiki does only it does it without telling you).  "Pages" should be layered so that a visitor gets a broad overview first, then clicks through to get finer and finer details.  One long page seems to miss the point of hyperlinks.

  However, as has been pointed out in elsewhere, this is a lousy place to have a discussion.  These are interesting points to discuss, but distracting on this page, so if anyone would like to pursue them further, I suggest we shift it over to the [forum](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Vanilla/nForum).

  What is more important is to let me know (preferably on the forum) of any other issues with the migrated site.  Now that my eyes have uncrossed, I've realised that I was misreading the MySQL article on storage limits and we _can_ have superlong pages so we will.  Soon.  I promise.

  (I still say it's a bad idea)

* [[Mike Shulman]]

  * Did some editing of [[center]] (added categorifications) and   [[normalizer]], and created [[centralizer]].

  * Tried to remove some of the duplication from [[dualizable object]], [[compact closed category]], and [[rigid monoidal category]], but some is still left.  Perhaps the latter two should really be combined on one page?

* [[Urs Schreiber]]

  * added links back and forth between the new [[extended topological quantum field theory]] and the old [[FQFT]] -- notice that there is a bit of overlap, we may want to rearrange material eventually over these two entries.

  * replied at [[category theory]] (down in the query box at the bottom)

* [[Jon Awbrey]] added a stub and a few links on the subject of [[inquiry]].


## 2009-09-01

* [[Rafael Borowiecki]]: Wrote the beginning of the well deserved page [[extended topological quantum field theory]].

* [[Rafael Borowiecki]]: Just as an interesting fact the new timeline which is not finished is 113kb, then extract the 4 or so long entries that were moved to separate pages and add literature, references and the long discussions. So how are other sites doing it? It looks like it is just nLab that runs into different troubels (even before the migration). I could mention more such as line breaks that is not working smooth or at all, but not now. I can not compare it to many sites but one is wikipedia. Even for editing as Zoran Škoda mentioned, wikipedia has no problem in editing parts of a page. I don't know which technology nLab is using (except a part of it is called instiki) but how about an upgrade to such technology as wikipedia is using? In fact everything that i noticed don't work here work in wikipedia. In all, the timeline could be split in two year parts and one main page with discussions, but i don't really like it. Then it would not feel like 2009.

  * [[Mike Shulman]]: Hmm, [deja vu](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Vanilla/nForum/comments.php?DiscussionID=28).

* [[Zoran Škoda]]: Thanks, Andrew a lot for all you are doing. Good night! I am loggin here another concern about terminology abstract nonsense. I am moving much in (predominantly noncommutative and algebraic) geometric
community and my exprience is that when somebody says they proved a fact by abstract nonsense it is NOT confined to categorical methods only but to any CLEAN and GENERAL methods "from the book" as opposed to specific unclean improvizations tailored to a very specific circumstance in question. 

* [[Andrew Stacey]]: My eyes are beginning to cross when reading the MySQL manual.  I may have been misreading a couple of things to do with data storage and it may be possible to get around the timeline problem.  However, I still think that long pages could be better split up.

  I sincerely hope that the lab survives the night, but I'm going offline now so please be patient with it!

* [[Zoran Škoda]]: of course, this is not a solution to the database problem, but I anyway think the discussion part could be separated from the main table of _Timeline_ and the _Timeline_ could have a separate part till 1960 say, then 1960 till 1989 and then third since 1990 (for example, better estimates possible). That would be easier for editing, with big file it is difficult to scroll when editing anyway. I created [[normalizer]], [[center]] (with a word on and redirect [[centralizer]]) and [[holomorph]]. Please check, it is elementary, but it was a quick writing. 

* [[Andrew Stacey]] is seriously considering finding The Doctor and borrowing the Tardis to go back and have a Serious Word with the designers of sqlite3.  (Anyone who gets the reference, I have a great photograph of a bus seen here in Trondheim that proves that The Doctor's greatest enemies are sneakily planning their next invasion from Norway.  But I digress.)  The problem with the timeline is the same as that with the long page names (and with an old problem in the testing stage with stylesheets).  It's down to a fundamental difference in design between sqlite3 (the old, slow database backend) and mysql (the newer, snappier model).  Basically, while both allow you to declare certain entries to be a certain type, sqlite3 then proceeds to __ignore that type__.  Mysql (and just about every other database) enforces it.  So when Instiki says "page names should be at most 60 chars long", Mysql truncates them to 60 chars while sqlite3 merrily accepts page names as long as Lanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch and back again.  Twice.  Similarly, where MySQL has a limit on lengths of rows in its database (happens to be 65535 bytes), sqlite3 merrily goes on accepting data as long as it gets it.

  You can see where this is going, can't you.  Yup, timeline hit that latter limit.  It's currently over 80000 _characters_, and some of those are unicode so I've no idea how many actual bytes it is!

  Before anyone suggests going back to sqlite3, let me point out that we can't scale up with sqlite3.  So that's a non-starter.  There are complicated possibilities in which we have more than one row for a page, but the absolute simplest would be to split long pages into smaller ones and then include them from the main one.  So we could split the timeline into, say, decades and then an extra bit for the discussion and simply include them all on the main timeline page.  That would also make editing the page a bit slicker and quicker.

  If that is acceptable, then I can load up the timeline in two segments for someone to carve up into more sensible pieces.  It'll be tomorrow now before I get round to doing this (sorry).

  I'll also have to figure out whether any more pages are affected by this.  I'm afraid that I'll have to roll these back to how they were when the lab was migrated (but presumably no-one's actually tried to edit one of these truncated pages, otherwise there'd've been more bugs noted here).

* [[Todd Trimble]] added a teeny bit to [[locally convex topological vector space]]. I hope to be more in nLab editor mode soon. Congratulations on a successful migration (with big thanks to [[Andrew Stacey]]). 

  [[Andrew Stacey]]: I'd hold off on the champagne for a little bit ...

* [[Zoran Škoda]]: query in [[category theory]]: I think that blaming the terminology *abstract nonsense* to predominantly non-likers is misleading and that the wikipedia is this time more correct than nlab. 

  * [[Jon Awbrey]]: I have always understood the term "abstract nonsense" as a pun on the sense of the word "sense" that means "direction" --- hence "abstract nonsense" suggests something like the "formal path-independence" of commutative diagrams.  I'm sure I mentioned this to several people back in the day, and they all said something like, "well, duh."

  * [[Zoran Škoda]]: I never heard of such interpretation; plus this interpretation would not survive in other languages like Russian and French where the direction and sense/nonsense do not mix like that. Russian version of *abstract nonsense* is абстрактная чепуха. 

* [[Jon Awbrey]] added stubs and links at [[sign relation]] and [[triadic relation]].

* [[Urs Schreiber]]: replied in the discussion at the bottom of [[category theory]] -- and have a question

  * [[Todd Trimble]] chucked in two cents here. 

* [[Urs Schreiber]]  WATCH OUT WITH LONG ENTRY NAMES -- see the $n$forum discussion. Some long entry names got truncated in the migration. the entry "Chevalley-eilenberg algebra in synthetic differential geometry" for instance is now called [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra in synthetic differential geomet]]

 See "all pages" to find out the truncated entry name of an entry that you know should be there but is missing. 

* [[Rafael Borowiecki]]: To [[Andrew Stacey]]. The whole bottom part of the page [[Timeline of category theory and related mathematics]] is abruptly missing. Which is a lot, not only my question. Since i have the full version loaded in a browser i could try to reconstruct it but i would prefer if you did a rollback if you can.

* [[Jon Awbrey]] added content to [[hypostatic abstraction]].

* [[John Baez]]: 

  * answered Rafael's plea for a definition of 'CW complex' in that big discussion on [[category theory]], and also commented on Urs' remark about 'simplicial complexes';

  * completed the definition of [[monoidal category]] by adding the triangle equation;
  
  * added some remarks on right vs. left duals on [[rigid monoidal category]];

  * noted that the $n$Lab crashed a couple of times while I was doing this.  Unfortunately I did not get a screenshot of the fancy error message.

    [[Andrew Stacey]]: Yes, we hit our memory ceiling a couple of times.  I've lowered a couple of settings to try to ensure that we don't do this again but it's a bit experimental as to what the best settings are.  It's all a bit of a learning experience for me!  (Perhaps I shouldn't admit to that ...)

* [[Zoran Škoda]]: I restarted the system and now IE renders [[normal subgroup]] correctly. This is strange as it had problems only with new entries [[normal subgroup]] and [[normal closure]] (even after many reloads) and rendered correctly the other entries. Now after reboot even they appear correct. 

  [[Andrew Stacey]]: Okay, sounds like it was a cache bug.  During the changeover, various addresses pointed all over the shop and there are redirects going all ways from Sunday, so it's not surprising that a browser get confused.  Clearing caches is probably a good idea.  It will take a while before ncatlab.org properly points here for everyone (for example, from my work machine it was working from about midday; now at home then it still resolves to the old lab).  But if you type 'ncatlab.org' into a browser you will always end up _here_, it just might be via a slightly circuitous route.

* [[Zoran Škoda]]: I just created [[normal subgroup]], [[normal closure]], but they do not render correctly on my IE. Is this a new-system glitch? The letters and formulas are one across another. Did not make last night logging that I added a paragraph or so on the Jacobi matrix and the application (Alexander polynomial) into the [[Fox derivative]]. I also created [[derived affine scheme]] in the sense of Toen et al. 

  [[Andrew Stacey]]: No idea!  Can you send me a screen shot?  Unfortunately, the Windows machine that I have control over can't connect to the wireless network here (Oh, the irony!) and the windows machine that I don't have control over doesn't have MathML support.

* [[Andrew Stacey]]: The migrating eagle has landed.

  There will inevitably be hiccoughs, hangups, and hassles.  Please log them over at the [nForum](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Vanilla/nForum).  Also, if you notice weird behaviour then there may be an explanation of it over there (just because I know what causes it doesn't mean I've implemented the fix yet).

*  [[Rafael Borowiecki]]:
  * Posed a question at [[Timeline of category theory and related mathematics]] regarding a new migration: How do i handle to update most of 1500 links!?
    * [[Andrew Stacey]]: I've looked for your question and can't find it.  I apologise if it's been lost in the migration, but can you ask it again?  If it's technical, the forum might be a better place to ask it.
  * Suggested that manifold objects should be treated or at least mentioned at [[manifold]].
  * Provided references for my question at [[Bousfield localization]].
  * Split the subsection what is category theory at [[category theory]] into two parts: In the narrow sense and In the wide sense. This makes sense.
  * Added briefly how toposes and higher categories come into category theory as a foundations at [[category theory]].
  * Added what it means for category theory to be a unifying tool and language in mathematics at [[category theory]].
  * Replied to the discussion at [[category theory]].
