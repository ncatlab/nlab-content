[[!include all changes]]

All non-trivial additions or changes to the $n$Lab should briefly be indicated here. This way [[Contributors|the rest of us]] can spot them, so we can learn what you know --- and maybe make further improvements!

+-- {: .standout}

Please log all your non-trivial changes to the $n$Lab here!

=--

Here "non-trivial" means: anything that any other contributor might be interested in taking notice of. If you fix a trivial typo in the text somewhere, that is highly appreciated but unlikely to be controversial and hence need not be logged here. But already if you fix a typo in some _formula_, it may be of interest. Generally: the more you log your activity here, the better. Even when in doubt whether anyone else might be interested in changes you made, drop a note here on what you did.

The importance of logging changes here is that

Logging changes here is the way to allow collaboration on the $n$Lab without everybody following every individual page.

Contributions that are not logged here are likely to be missed and ignored. And that can't be the point of making a contribution. 

These comments should go in _reverse_ chronological order, so that the latest are on top of the list. To keep the list international, use the date in **UTC** (the date given by the server for your edits).  However, regardless of that, be sure to **add new comments to the top** of the list.

## 2009-09-01

*  [[Rafael Borowiecki]]:
  * Suggested that manifold objects should be treated or at least mentioned at [[manifold]].
  * Provided references for my question at [[Bousfield localization]].
  * Split the subsection what is category theory at [[category theory]] into two parts: In the narrow sense and In the wide sense. This makes sense.
  * Added briefly how toposes and higher categories come into category theory as a foundations at [[category theory]].
  * Added what it means for category theory to be a unifying tool and language in mathematics at [[category theory]].
  * Replied to the discussion at [[category theory]].

  I see the migration went well, at least so far. :)

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  Happy September!!!

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  Now, you know it\'s not September for another half hour, right?  (^_^)

* [[Urs Schreiber]]

  * moved the accumulated latest changes of last month to [[2009 August changes]] (by renaming the last "latest changes" and then creating a new one)
