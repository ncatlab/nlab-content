All non-trivial additions or changes to the $n$Lab should briefly be indicated here. This way [[Contributors|the rest of us]] can spot them, so we can learn what you know --- and maybe make further improvements!

Please log all your non-trivial changes to the $n$Lab here!

Here "non-trivial" means: anything that any other contributor might be interested in taking notice of. If you fix a trivial typo in the text somewhere, that is highly appreciated but unlikely to be controversial and hence need not be logged here. But already if you fix a typo in some _formula_, it may be of interest. Generally: the more you log your activity here, the better. Even when in doubt whether anyone else might be interested in changes you made, drop a note here on what you did.

The importance of logging changes here is that

Logging changes here is the way to allow collaboration on the $n$Lab without everybody following every individual page.

Contributions that are not logged here are likely to be missed and ignored. And that can't be the point of making a contribution. 

These comments should go in _reverse_ chronological order, so that the latest are on top of the list. To keep the list international, use the date in **UTC** (the date given by the server for your edits).  However, regardless of that, be sure to **add new comments to the top** of the list.

## 2009-09-01
* [[Zoran Škoda]]: query in [[category theory]]: I think that blaming the terminology *abstract nonsense* to predominantly non-likers is misleading and that the wikipedia is this time more correct than nlab. 

  * [[Jon Awbrey]]: I have always understood the term "abstract nonsense" as a pun on the sense of the word "sense" that means "direction" --- hence "abstract nonsense" suggests something like the "formal path-independence" of commutative diagrams.  I'm sure I mentioned this to several people back in the day, and they all said something like, "well, duh."

* [[Jon Awbrey]] added stubs and links at [[sign relation]] and [[triadic relation]].

* [[Urs Schreiber]]: replied in the discussion at the bottom of [[category theory]] -- and have a question

* [[Urs Schreiber]]  WATCH OUT WITH LONG ENTRY NAMES -- see the $n$forum discussion. Some long entry names got truncated in the migration. the entry "Chevalley-eilenberg algebra in synthetic differential geometry" for instance is now called [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra in synthetic differential geomet]]

 See "all pages" to find out the truncated entry name of an entry that you know should be there but is missing. 


* [[Rafael Borowiecki]]: To [[Andrew Stacey]]. The whole bottom part of the page [[Timeline of category theory and related mathematics]] is abruptly missing. Which is a lot, not only my question. Since i have the full version loaded in a browser i could try to reconstruct it but i would prefer if you did a rollback if you can.

* [[Jon Awbrey]] added content to [[hypostatic abstraction]].

* [[John Baez]]: 

  * answered Rafael's plea for a definition of 'CW complex' in that big discussion on [[category theory]], and also commented on Urs' remark about 'simplicial complexes';

  * completed the definition of [[monoidal category]] by adding the triangle equation;
  
  * added some remarks on right vs. left duals on [[rigid monoidal category]];

  * noted that the $n$Lab crashed a couple of times while I was doing this.  Unfortunately I did not get a screenshot of the fancy error message.

* [[Zoran Škoda]]: I restarted the system and now IE renders [[normal subgroup]] correctly. This is strange as it had problems only with new entries [[normal subgroup]] and [[normal closure]] (even after many reloads) and rendered correctly the other entries. Now after reboot even they appear correct. 

  [[Andrew Stacey]]: Okay, sounds like it was a cache bug.  During the changeover, various addresses pointed all over the shop and there are redirects going all ways from Sunday, so it's not surprising that a browser get confused.  Clearing caches is probably a good idea.  It will take a while before ncatlab.org properly points here for everyone (for example, from my work machine it was working from about midday; now at home then it still resolves to the old lab).  But if you type 'ncatlab.org' into a browser you will always end up _here_, it just might be via a slightly circuitous route.

* [[Zoran Škoda]]: I just created [[normal subgroup]], [[normal closure]], but they do not render correctly on my IE. Is this a new-system glitch? The letters and formulas are one across another. Did not make last night logging that I added a paragraph or so on the Jacobi matrix and the application (Alexander polynomial) into the [[Fox derivative]]. I also created [[derived affine scheme]] in the sense of Toen et al. 

  [[Andrew Stacey]]: No idea!  Can you send me a screen shot?  Unfortunately, the Windows machine that I have control over can't connect to the wireless network here (Oh, the irony!) and the windows machine that I don't have control over doesn't have MathML support.

* [[Andrew Stacey]]: The migrating eagle has landed.

  There will inevitably be hiccoughs, hangups, and hassles.  Please log them over at the [nForum](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Vanilla/nForum).  Also, if you notice weird behaviour then there may be an explanation of it over there (just because I know what causes it doesn't mean I've implemented the fix yet).

* [[Urs Schreiber]]

  * replied at [[Bousfield localization]]

* [[Jon Awbrey]]:

  * "A [[continuous predicate]], as described by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], is a special type of relational predicate that arises as the limit of an iterated process of [[hypostatic abstraction]]."

*  [[Rafael Borowiecki]]:
  * Posed a question at [[Timeline of category theory and related mathematics]] regarding a new migration: How do i handle to update most of 1500 links!?
    * [[Andrew Stacey]]: I've looked for your question and can't find it.  I apologise if it's been lost in the migration, but can you ask it again?  If it's technical, the forum might be a better place to ask it.
  * Suggested that manifold objects should be treated or at least mentioned at [[manifold]].
  * Provided references for my question at [[Bousfield localization]].
  * Split the subsection what is category theory at [[category theory]] into two parts: In the narrow sense and In the wide sense. This makes sense.
  * Added briefly how toposes and higher categories come into category theory as a foundations at [[category theory]].
  * Added what it means for category theory to be a unifying tool and language in mathematics at [[category theory]].
  * Replied to the discussion at [[category theory]].

   I see the migration went well, at least so far. :)

   ([[Andrew Stacey]]: actually, it happened _after_ you posted this, but thanks all the same!

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  Happy September!!!

*  [[Toby Bartels]]:  Now, you know it\'s not September for another half hour, right?  (^_^)

   * [[Urs Schreiber]]: oops, you are right, I forgot that I am not exactly at GMT +0. 

* [[Urs Schreiber]]

  * moved the accumulated latest changes of last month to [[2009 August changes]] (by renaming the last "latest changes" and then creating a new one)
