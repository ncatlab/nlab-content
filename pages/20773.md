[[Mikio Sato]] introduced an infinite-dimensional Grassmannian in relation to the [[integrable system]]s. It gives a standard way to describe the $\tau$-[[tau-function|function]]. Constructed also by [[Graeme Segal]] and Wilson so it is often called Sato-Segal-Wilson Grassmannian.

> A classical way to introduce tau functions for integrable hierarchies of solitonic equationsis by means of the Sato–Segal–Wilson infinite-dimensional Grassmannian. Every point in the Grassmannian is naturally related to a [[Riemann–Hilbert problem]] on the unit circle, for which Bertola proposed a tau function that generalizes the Jimbo–Miwa–Ueno tau function for isomonodromic deformation problems. In this paper, we prove that the Sato–Segal–Wilson tau function and the (generalized) Jimbo–Miwa–Ueno isomonodromy tau function coincide under a very general setting, by identifying each of them to the large-size limit of a block Toeplitz determinant. As an application, we give a new definition of tau function for Drinfeld–Sokolov hierarchies (and their generalizations) by means of infinite-dimensional Grassmannians, and clarify their relation with other tau functions given in the literature.
