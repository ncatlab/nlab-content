Following the pattern of the notion of [[(n,r)-category]], an _$(n,n)$-category_ is a [[higher category theory|higher category]] with non-trivial cells of at most dimension $n$ and none of them guaranteed to be reversible. 

So this is what is usually simply called an [[n-category]].

Note that it is possible to go on to an $(n,n+1)$-category, or $(n+1)$-[[n-poset|poset]].  You can either consider than the $n$-cells are ordered, or else consider that there are irreversible $(n+1)$-cells which are indistinguishable.  (Reversible indistinguishable $(n+1)$-cells are all identities and so might as well not exist.)
