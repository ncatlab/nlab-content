## Definition

Every [[strict 2-category]] $K$ with finite [[strict 2-limits]] and finite strict 2-colimits becomes a [[model category]] (or, rather, its underlying 1-category does) in a canonical way, where:

* The weak equivalences are the [[equivalences]].

* The fibrations are the morphisms that are representably [[isofibrations]], i.e. the morphisms $e\to b$ such that $K(x,e)\to K(x,b)$ is an isofibration for all $x\in K$.

* The cofibrations are determined.

We call it the **2-trivial model structure**, as it is a 2-categorical analogue of the [[trivial model structure]] on any 1-category.  It can be said to regard $C$ as an [[(âˆž,1)-category]] with only trivial [[k-morphisms]] for $k \geq 3$.


## Properties

* Every object is fibrant and cofibrant.

* In [[Cat]], this produces the [[canonical model structure]].

* By duality, any such category has another model structure, with the same weak equivalences but where the cofibrations are the iso-cofibrations and the fibrations are determined.  In $Cat$, the two model structures are the same.

* If $T$ is an [[accessible functor|accessible]] [[strict 2-monad]] on a [[locally finitely presentable category|locally finitely presentable]] [[strict 2-category]] $K$.  Then the category $T Alg_s$ of strict $T$-[[algebra over a monad|algebras]] admits a [[transferred model structure]] from the 2-trivial model structure on $K$.  The cofibrant objects therein are the [[flexible algebra]]s.
