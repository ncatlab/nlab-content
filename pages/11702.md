[[!redirects cohesive ∞-presheaf on E-∞ rings]]

> This entry is about a weak representability condition on [[(∞,1)-presheaves]] in [[E-∞ geometry]]. Intuitively this expresses similar behaviour as discussed at _[[cohesion]]_ and _[[infinitesimal cohesion]]_, but the definitions themselves are independent and unrelated and apply in somewhat disjoint contexts.

## Definition

Write $CRing_\infty^{cn}$ for the [[(∞,1)-category]] of connective [[E-∞ rings]]. An [[(∞,1)-functor]]

$$
  X \;\colon\; CRing_\infty^{cn}\longrightarrow \infty Grpd
$$

([[(∞,1)-presheaf]] on $(CRing_\infty^{cn})^{op}$) is called _cohesive_ ([Lurie Rep, def. 2.1.1](#LurieRep)) if it sends [[(∞,1)-fiber products]] of [[morphisms]] which are [[surjection|surjective]] on $\pi_0$ to [[(∞,1)-fiber products]].

If at least fiber products of morphisms as above whose [[kernels]] are [[nilpotent ideals]] are preserved, then $X$ is called _infinitesimally cohesive_ ([Lurie Rep, def. 2.1.9](#LurieRep)).

Infinitesimal cohesion implies one of the conditions on a [[formal moduli problem]]. It is also one of the sufficient conditions in the [[Artin-Lurie representability theorem]].
