## Idea

The **Elementary Theory of the Category of Sets** ([Lawvere 65](#Lawvere65)), or _ETCS_ for short, is a formulation of [[set theory|set-theoretic]] [[foundations]] in a [[category theory|category-theoretic]] spirit.  As such, it is the prototypical [[structural set theory]].  

More in detail, ETCS is a [[first-order theory]] axiomatizing [[elementary toposes]] and specifically those which are [[well-pointed topos|well-pointed]], have a [[natural numbers object]] and satisfy the [[axiom of choice]]. The idea is, first of all, that traditional mathematics naturally takes place "[[internal logic|inside]]" such a topos, and second that by varying the axioms much of mathematics may be done inside more general toposes: for instance omitting the [[well-pointed topos|well-pointedness]] and the [[axiom of choice]] but adding the [[Kock-Lawvere axiom]] gives a [[smooth topos]] inside which [[synthetic differential geometry]] takes place.

Modern mathematics with emphasis on concepts of [[homotopy theory]] would more directly be founded in this spirit by an axiomatization not just of [[elementary toposes]] but of [[elementary (∞,1)-toposes]]. This is roughly what [[univalence|univalent]] [[homotopy type theory]] accomplishes -- for more on this see at _[relation between type theory and category theory -- Univalent HoTT and Elementary infinity-toposes](relation+between+type+theory+and+category+theory#HomotopyWithUnivalence)_.

Instead of increasing the [[higher category theory|higher categorical dimension]] [[(n,r)-category|(n,r)]] in the first argument, one may also, in this context of elementary foundations, consider raising the second argument. The case $(2,2)$ is the elementary theory of the 2-category of categories ([[ETCC]]).

## Todd Trimble's exposition of ETCS
 {#ExpositionByTrimble}

[[Todd Trimble]] has a series of expositional writings on ETCS which provide a very careful introduction and at the same time a wealth of useful details.

Erik Palmgren has a [[constructive mathematics|constructive]] [[predicative mathematics|predicative]] variant of ETCS, which can be summarized as: $Set$ is a [[well-pointed topos|well-pointed]] $\Pi$-[[Π-pretopos|pretopos]] with a [[NNO]] and [[enough projectives]] (i.e. [[COSHEP]] is satisfied).  Here "well-pointed" must be taken in its constructive sense, as including that the [[terminal object]] is indecomposable and projective.
