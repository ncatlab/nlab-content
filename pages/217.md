## Idea

The **Elementary Theory of the Category of Sets**, ETCS for short, is a formulation of [[set theory|set-theoretic]] [[foundations]] in a [[category theory|category-theoretic]] spirit.  As such, it is the prototypical [[structural set theory]].  


## Definition

The axioms of ETCS can be summed up in one sentence as:

###### Definition

The [[Set|category of sets]] is [[generalized the|the]] [[topos]] which is

1. is [[well-pointed topos]] 

1. has a [[natural numbers object]]

1. and satisfies the [[axiom of choice]].

## Todd Trimble's exposition of ETCS

[[Todd Trimble]] has a series of expositional writings on ETCS which provide a very careful introduction and at the same time a wealth of useful details.

ETCS was proposed by [[Bill Lawvere]], who published an undergraduate set-theory textbook using it:

Erik Palmgren has a [[constructive mathematics|constructive]] [[predicative mathematics|predicative]] variant of ETCS, which can be summarized as: $Set$ is a [[well-pointed topos|well-pointed]] $\Pi$-[[Î -pretopos|pretopos]] with a [[NNO]] and [[enough projectives]] (i.e. [[COSHEP]] is satisfied).  Here "well-pointed" must be taken in its constructive sense, as including that the [[terminal object]] is indecomposable and projective.
