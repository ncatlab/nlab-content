The **Elementary Theory of the Category of Sets**, ETCS for short, is a formulation of [[set theory|set-theoretic]] [[foundations]] in a [[category theory|category-theoretic]] spirit.  As such, it is the prototypical [[structural set theory]].  The axioms of ETCS can be summed up in one sentence as:

* _The [[Set|category of sets]] is a [[well-pointed topos]] with a [[natural numbers object]] satisfying the [[axiom of choice]]._

ETCS was proposed by [[Bill Lawvere]], who published an undergraduate set-theory textbook using it:

* F. William Lawvere, R. Rosebrugh, [_Sets for mathematics_](http://books.google.de/books?id=h3_7aZz9ZMoC&pg=PP1&dq=sets+for+mathematics)

An informative discussion of the pros and cons of Lawvere's aproach can be found in

#Todd Trimble's exposition of ETCS#

[[Todd Trimble]] has a series of expositional writings on ETCS which provide a very careful introduction and at the same time a wealth of useful details.
