A _group functor_ is a [[group object]] in a functor category.

A *$k$-group functor* is a [[k-functor]] which is a group functor.

A group functor which is a scheme is called *$k$-group scheme* or just *$k$-group*. The category of $k$-groups is denoted by $Gr_k$.

## Terminology

The terminology of group-functors is mainly used in the theory of [[algebraic group|algebraic groups]] in algebraic geometry. If $G$ is a group functor the multiplication morphism $\pi:G\times G\to G$ is called _group law on_ $G$.
