A __prime ideal theorem__ is a theorem stating that every [[proper ideal]] is contained in some [[prime ideal]].  A prime ideal theorem is typically equivalent to the [[ultrafilter principle]] (UF), a weak form of the [[axiom of choice]] (AC).

We say 'a' prime ideal theorem (PIT) instead of 'the' prime ideal theorem, since we have not said what the ideals are in.  There are several examples:

*  The PIT for [[rings]] is equivalent to UF.

*  The PIT for [[distributive lattices]] is equivalent to UF.

*  The PIT for [[Boolean algebras]] is equivalent to UF.

*  The PIT for [[rigs]], which subsumes all of the above, is probably also equivalent to UF; in any case, it follows from AC.

One typically proves a prime ideal theorem with [[Zorn's Lemma]], unless one is specifically trying to use something weaker.

## Proofs of equivalence 

A typical way in which these proofs work uses a Compactness Theorem for first-order logic (or [[Tychonoff theorem]] for [[compact Hausdorff spaces]]) as a stepping stone. These and the Boolean algebra PIT (better known as the Boolean prime ideal theorem, or BPIT) form a circle of ideas on which these logical or model-theoretic methods depend, so we'll go into that equivalence first. 

First, prime ideals in Boolean algebras (or Boolean rings) $B$ are the same as maximal ideals, and these just correspond to ultrafilters (see [here](/nlab/show/Boolean+algebra#aremax)). So UF, which says that every filter in $B = P X$ 
is contained in an ultrafilter, is just a special case of the BPIT: every ideal of $P X$ (consisting of negations of elements of a corresponding filter) is contained in a prime ideal. That the Tychonoff theorem for compact Hausdorff implies BPIT was proven [here](/nlab/show/Tychonoff+theorem#nonempty), noting that to prove that every proper ideal $I$ of $B$ is contained in a prime ideal, it suffices to find a prime ideal (or ultrafilter) of $B/I$, pulling it back along the quotient $B \to B/I$ to a prime ideal of $B$. This brings us full circle: BPIT implies UF implies Tychonoff(CH) implies BPIT. 

Now let us prove that the Tychonoff theorem for CH spaces implies the PIT for rigs: that any proper ideal $I$ of $R$ is contained in a prime ideal of $R$. By passing to the quotient rig $R/I$, it suffices to show that $R/I$ has a prime ideal $P$, since the inverse image $\phi^{-1}(P)$ of a prime ideal $P$ along the quotient map $\phi: R \to R/I$ is again prime.

###### Theorem 
(UF) 
Any commutative ring $R$ has a prime ideal $P$.

To prove this, we are going to write down a propositional theory of "a prime ideal $P$ of $R$" (or, just as well, consider its [[Lindenbaum algebra]]). Form a free Boolean algebra $Bool(U R)$ freely generated by the underlying set of $R$. So each $x \in U R$ corresponds to a generator $P_x \in Bool(U R)$, which we will think of as standing for a proposition $P_x = $ "$x \in P$". The conditions that enforce "$P$ is a prime ideal" are then the axioms of our theory: 

* ($P$ is closed under finite sums) $P_0$, $P_a \wedge P_b \Rightarrow P_{a+b}$. 

* ($P$ is closed under multiplication by scalars) For each $b \in U R$, $P_a \Rightarrow P_{a b}, P_a \Rightarrow P_{b a}$. 

* ($P$ is proper) $\neg P_1$. 

* (primality condition) $P_{a b} \Rightarrow (P_a \vee P_b)$. 

These axioms (certain elements of $Bool(U R)$ then generate a [[filter]] $F$. As soon as we know $F$ is proper ("finite satisfiability of the theory"), the BPIT ensures that $F$ is contained in an ultrafilter $U$, corresponding to a [[model]] or a Boolean ring homomorphism $Bool(U R)/F \to \mathbf{2}$ out of the Lindenbaum algebra. For that model, the collection $\{a \in R: P_a \in U\}$ then forms a prime ideal $P$ of $R$, as desired. So:

###### Proof 
(That the filter $F$ is proper.) This comes down to showing that any finitely generated commutative ring $R$ has a prime ideal. Now $R$ is of the form $\mathbb{Z}[x_1, \ldots, x_n]/I$ for some ideal $I$, so it comes down to showing that any ideal $I$ of $\mathbb{Z}[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ is contained in a prime $p$. We argue by induction on $n$, and we permit ourselves to invoke WKL (weak K&ouml;nig's lemma), which follows from (UF) by the argument presented [here](/nlab/show/compactness+theorem#wkl). (...)

(To be continued, and probably radically rewritten later. I'm just learning of the equivalence between UF and very general prime ideals, including (and subsuming) those above, but I need to read more. One thing I'm looking at is [here](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/242573716_Prime_Ideal_Theorems_and_systems_of_finite_character).)
