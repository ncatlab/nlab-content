A __prime ideal theorem__ is a theorem stating that every [[proper ideal]] is contained in some [[prime ideal]].  A prime ideal theorem is typically equivalent to the [[ultrafilter principle]] (UF), a weak form of the [[axiom of choice]] (AC).

We say 'a' prime ideal theorem (PIT) instead of 'the' prime ideal theorem, since we have not said what the ideals are in.  There are several examples:

*  The PIT for (commutative) [[rings]] is equivalent to UF.

*  The PIT for [[distributive lattices]] is equivalent to UF.

*  The PIT for [[Boolean algebras]] is equivalent to UF.

*  The PIT for [[rigs]], which subsumes all of the above, is probably also equivalent to UF; in any case, it follows from AC. 

One typically proves a prime ideal theorem with [[Zorn's Lemma]], unless one is specifically trying to use something weaker like UF, as we shall below. 

That the Boolean PIT is equivalent to UF is classical and is recalled below. Thus the PIT for rings, distributive lattices, or rigs all imply UF, since Boolean algebras and the notion of prime ideal thereof can be considered special cases of each of these. 

## Proofs of equivalence 

A typical way in which these proofs work uses a Compactness Theorem for first-order logic (or [[Tychonoff theorem]] for [[compact Hausdorff spaces]]) as a stepping stone. These and the Boolean algebra PIT (better known as the Boolean prime ideal theorem, or BPIT) form a circle of ideas on which these logical or model-theoretic methods depend, so we'll go into that equivalence first. 

### Boolean PIT and the ultrafilter principle 

First, prime ideals in Boolean algebras (or Boolean rings) $B$ are the same as maximal ideals. For, the corresponding Boolean quotient ring is an integral domain only if it is the field $\mathbb{Z}/(2)$, since idempotency of elements yields $e(1-e) = 0$ and then $e = 0$ or $e = 1$ assuming no zero divisors. 

Second, maximal ideals are complementary to ultrafilters (see [here](/nlab/show/Boolean+algebra#aremax)). So UF, which says that every filter in $B = P X$ 
is contained in an ultrafilter, translates into a special case of the BPIT: every ideal of $P X$ (consisting of negations of elements of a corresponding filter) is contained in a prime/maximal ideal. 

That the Tychonoff theorem for compact Hausdorff spaces implies BPIT was proven [here](/nlab/show/Tychonoff+theorem#nonempty), noting that to prove that every proper ideal $I$ of $B$ is contained in a prime ideal, it suffices to find a prime ideal (or ultrafilter) of $B/I$, pulling it back along the quotient $B \to B/I$ to a prime ideal of $B$. This brings us full circle: BPIT implies UF implies Tychonoff(CH) implies BPIT. 

### Ultrafilter principle implies prime ideal theorem for rings

Now let us prove that the Tychonoff theorem for CH spaces implies the PIT for commutative rings: that any proper ideal $I$ of $R$ is contained in a prime ideal of $R$. By passing to the quotient rig $R/I$, it suffices to show that $R/I$ has a prime ideal $P$, since the inverse image $\phi^{-1}(P)$ of a prime ideal $P$ along the quotient map $\phi: R \to R/I$ is again prime.

###### Theorem 
(UF) 
Any commutative ring $R$ has a prime ideal $P$.

To prove this, we'll write down a propositional theory of "a prime ideal $P$ of $R$" (or, just as well, consider its [[Lindenbaum algebra]]). Form a free Boolean algebra $Bool(U R)$ freely generated by the underlying set of $R$. So each $x \in U R$ corresponds to a generator $P_x \in Bool(U R)$, which we will think of as standing for a proposition $P_x = $ "$x \in P$". The conditions that enforce "$P$ is a prime ideal" are then the axioms of our theory: 

* ($P$ is closed under finite sums) $P_0$, $P_a \wedge P_b \Rightarrow P_{a+b}$. 

* ($P$ is closed under multiplication by scalars) For each $b \in U R$, $P_a \Rightarrow P_{a b}, P_a \Rightarrow P_{b a}$. 

* ($P$ is proper) $\neg P_1$. 

* (primality condition) $P_{a b} \Rightarrow (P_a \vee P_b)$. 

These axioms (certain elements of $Bool(U R)$) then generate a [[filter]] $F$. As soon as we know $F$ is proper ("finite satisfiability of the theory"), the BPIT ensures that $F$ is contained in an ultrafilter $\mathcal{U}$, corresponding to a [[model]] or a Boolean ring homomorphism $Bool(U R)/F \to \mathbf{2}$ out of the Lindenbaum algebra. For that model, the collection $\{a \in R: P_a \in \mathcal{U}\}$ then forms a prime ideal $P$ of $R$, as desired. So:

###### Proof 
(That the theory is finitely satisfiable.) This follows if we show that any finitely generated commutative ring $R$ has a prime ideal. In fact we will do more and show that any provably [[countable set|countable]] commutative ring $R$ with unit admits a prime ideal. For this we use WKL (weak K&ouml;nig's lemma), in the form given [here](/nlab/show/compactness+theorem#weak). 

The case where $R$ is finite is left to the reader. So WLOG, assume that we are given an enumeration $a_0, a_1, a_2, \ldots$ of the elements of $R$. The strategy is to build an infinite but finitely branching tree with nodes labeled by suitable ideals of $R$, in such a way that the union of subsets that label the nodes of an infinite branch (which exists by WKL) is manifestly a (proper) prime ideal. 

Let $2^{\lt \omega}$ be the maximal infinite planar binary tree, i.e., the set of finite 0-1 sequences or words. Each word $\sigma \in 2^{\lt \omega}$ may be lengthened by 1 in two ways, denoted $\sigma 0$ and $\sigma 1$. Our tree $T$ will be a subtree of $2^{\lt \omega}$, i.e., $T$ is a subset of words closed under taking prefixes. The set of words of length $k$ in $T$ is denoted $T_k$, so $T$ is the disjoint union of the $T_k$. 

For $\sigma \in T$, we denote its ideal-label by $P_\sigma$. We define $T_k$ and the $P_\sigma$ for $\sigma \in T_k$ by recursion. $T_0$ consists of just the empty word $e$, and we set $P_e = \{0\}$. Now suppose given $T_{k-1}$ and $P_\sigma$ for all $\sigma \in T_{k-1}$. We define $T_k$ and the ideals $P_\tau: \tau\in T_k$ by distinguishing two cases; accordingly we write $k = 2m + n$ where $n \in \{0, 1\}$ where $m$ codes a pair of natural numbers $(i, j)$ by the usual trick: $m = \binom{i+j+1}{2} + j$. 

1. If $n = 0$, then for every $\sigma \in T_{k-1}$ such that $a_i a_j$ belongs to $P_\sigma$, put $\sigma 0, \sigma 1$ in $T_k$, and put $P_{\sigma 0} = P_{\sigma} + \langle a_i \rangle$, and put $P_{\sigma 1} = P_{\sigma} + \langle a_j \rangle$. For any other $\sigma \in T_{k-1}$, put $\sigma 0$ in $T_k$, and put $P_{\sigma 0} = P_{\sigma}$. 

1. If $n = 1$, then put $\sigma 0$ in $T_k$ for each $\sigma \in T_{k-1}$ such that $1 \notin P_\sigma$, and put $P_{\sigma 0} = P_\sigma$. If $1 \in P_\sigma$, then put neither $\sigma 0$ nor $\sigma 1$ in $T_k$. 

To apply WKL, we check that $T$ is an infinite tree: we prove by induction that for every $k$ there exists $\sigma \in T_k$ such that $1 \notin P_\sigma$. This is trivial if $k = 0$. If $1 \notin P_\sigma$ for $\sigma \in T_{k-1}$ and we are in case 2 ($k = 1 \mod 2$), then clearly for $\sigma 0 \in T_k$ we have $P_{\sigma 0} = P_\sigma$ and so $1 \notin P_{\sigma 0}$. Now suppose $1 \notin P_\sigma$ for $\sigma \in T_{k-1}$ and we are in case 1. If $1 \in P_\sigma + \langle a_i \rangle$ and $1 \in P_\sigma + \langle a_j \rangle$, i.e., if $1 = p + r a_i$ and $1 = q + s a_j$ for $p, q \in P_\sigma$, then $1 = (p q + p s a_j + q r a_i) + r s a_i a_j$ clearly belongs to $P_\sigma + \langle a_i a_j \rangle = P_\sigma$, a contradiction. So either $1 \notin P_{\sigma 0}$ or $1 \notin P_{\sigma 1}$, and the induction goes through.  

By WKL, there is an infinite branch $b$ through $T$, and we put $P = \bigcup_{\sigma \in b} P_\sigma$. Clearly $1 \notin P$ since otherwise if $1 \in P_\sigma$ for $\sigma \in b$, then we can go no further up the branch by case 2. So $P$ is a proper ideal. It is a prime ideal by case 1.

(To be continued, and probably radically rewritten later. I'm just learning of the equivalence between UF and very general prime ideal theorems, including (and subsuming) those above, but I need to read more. One thing I'm looking at is [here](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/242573716_Prime_Ideal_Theorems_and_systems_of_finite_character).)
