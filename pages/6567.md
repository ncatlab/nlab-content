## Idea

The [[mechanics]] of _rigid bodies_ in [[Cartesian space]].

Up to the dynamics of the [[center of mass]], this is the special case of [[Hamiltonian dynamics on Lie groups]] for the case of the [[special orthogonal group]] $SO(n)$.

Often this is considered (only) for $n = 3$, which is the case pertaining to rigid bodys in observable nature.
