## Idea

In [[string theory]] the _NS-[[branes]]_ are 

* the [[string]] itself

* the [[NS5-brane]].

These are also called the **F1-brane** and the **F5-brane**, respectively, for _fundamental brane_ .

To be distinguished from the [[D-branes]] in [[type II string theory]]  and from the [[M-brane]]s in [[11-dimensional supergravity]].

## Properties

### Charges and background fields

The fundamental [[string]] carries [[electric charge]] under the [[background gauge field]] called the [[Kalb-Ramond field]]/[[B-field]].

The [[NS5-brane]] carries [[magnetic charge]] under this field.

Notice how this relates the dimensions. The [[B-field]] is a [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle 2-bundle]] with connection hence has [[higher parallel transport]] over 2-dimensional surfaces: the $(1+1)$-dimensional [[worldsheet]] of the [[string]]. Its [[electric-magnetic duality|EM dual]] in the ambient 10-dimensional [[supergravity]] [[spacetime]] is a [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle 6-bundle with connection]] with [[higher parallel transport]] over the $5+1$-dimensional [[worldvolume]] of the NS5-brane.
