## Idea

_Lindström's theorem_, or more precisely, theorem _s_, are important results in [[abstract model theory]] due to the Swedish logician [[Per Lindström]] that give 'syntax-free' characterizations of standard (unsorted finitary) [[first-order logic]] ('syntax-free' in the sense of not referring to the specific [[syntax|syntactic]] make up of the formulas).

###The first theorem of Lindström###
This  ([[semantics|semantic]]) version of Lindström's characterization is the best known and is usually meant when one speaks of ' _the_ theorem of Lindström' . It states that the validity of the downward [[Löwenheim-Skolem theorem]] (a sentence that holds in some [[model]] already holds in an at most countable model) and the [[compactness theorem]] (a set of sentences has a model if every finite subset has a model) characterizes up to expressive power standard [[first-order logic]] among all [[formal logic|logics]] satisfying certain regularity conditions[^fine]:

[^fine]: These conditions formalize some classical background assumptions on logical systems like the restriction of semantics to standard set-theoretic structures and the existence of [[negation]] in the sense that for every sentence $\varphi$ there is $\psi$ such that $\mathfrak{A}\models\varphi$ iff not $\mathfrak{A}\models\psi$.

A gain in expressive power comes at the price of the loss of the validity of at least one of these theorems e.g. in [[second-order logic]] both theorems fail to hold. 

The first Lindström theorem has been called _'one of the first, and still most striking, results in abstract model theory'_ by Jon Barwise in 1977.

###The second theorem of Lindström###
The _second_ Lindström theorem is of a more proof-theoretic nature and involves the concept of an _effective logical system_ which draws on [[computability theory]]. It achieves a characterization of standard first-order logic in the class of all effective regular logical systems by the two properties of having an enumerable set of tautologies and validity of the Löwenheim-Skolem theorem.

##Comments##
These results are sometimes viewed as an explanation of the privileged role that standard first-order logic plays in mathematical logic.

Further alternative characterizations and extensions to other logics are known and constitute the field of [[abstract model theory]].
