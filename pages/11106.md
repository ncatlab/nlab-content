## Idea

Linear implication is the most common version of [[implication]]/[[function type]] in [[linear logic]]/[[linear type theory]].

The [[categorical semantics]] of linear implication is as the [[internal hom]] in the [[closed monoidal category]] of [[types]].

Closely related is the *multiplicative implication* of [[bunched implication]] logic, though they behave somewhat differently.
