## Idea

For [[N=2 D=4 super Yang-Mills theory]] the [[moduli space]] of [[vacuum expectation values]] (VEVs) of the theory is locally a [[Cartesian product]] between the space of [[moduli]] of the [[vector multiplet]] (the [[gauge field]] sector) and those of the [[hypermultiplet]] (the scalar matter field sector). The former is called the _Coulomb branch_, and the latter the [[Higgs branch]]. These are [[duality in physics|dual]] to each other under a version of [[mirror symmetry]] . 

This is the topic of [[Seiberg-Witten theory]].

Definitions of the Coulomb and Higgs branches have been extended to [[N=4 D=3 super Yang-Mills theory]].

## Definition

### D=4

### D=3

Given $G$ a complex reductive group and $M$ a complex symplectic representation of the form $M=N \bigoplus N^*$, the Coulomb branch is defined as the spectrum of the ring given by equivariant Borel-Moore homology $H_\bullet^{G_\mathcal{O}} ( \mathcal{R} )$ with convolution product. $\mathcal{R}$ is a space of triples of a $G$ principle bundle over the formal disk $\mathcal{P}$, a trivialization over the punctured formal disk $\phi$ and a section $s$ of $\mathcal{P} \times_G N$ with the restriction that $\phi (s)$ extends over the puncture.

By including $\mathbb{C}^*$ equivariance as well, this gives a non-commutative deformation. This gives a Poisson structure at the classical level.

#### Examples

* If $N=0$, this gives the Bezrukavnikov-Finkelberg-Mirkovic (BFM) space for the Langlands dual $^L G$.
