## Idea

__Galois types__ are a generalization of types for [[abstract elementary class]]es with [[amalgamation property]].

Consider the [[type (in model theory)]] $tp(a/M)$ for a first order theory in larger uncountable saturated model $M'$ (of cardinality strictly larger than of the underlying language). By a standard result it can be identified with the orbit of $a$ under the automorphism group $Aut_M(M')$  of $M'$ fixing $M$ pointwise. This is taken as a definition for some infinitary theories in the case we have the monster model. A slightly weaker version can be rephrased in terms of amalgamation. 

## Definition

Let  $(K,\lt)$ be an [[abstract elementary class]] of structures.
