## Idea

For $C$ a [[small category]], and $PSh(C)$ its [[presheaf topos]], we have (by the discussion at _[Profunctor -- In terms of colimit preserving functors on presheaf categories](profunctor#FuncsOnPresheaves)_) that a [[colimit]]-preserving [[functor]] $PSh(C) \to Set$ is equivalently itself a [[copresheaf]] on $C$:

$$
  [PSh(C), Set]_{coc} \simeq CoPSh(C)
  \,.
$$

If we replace in this statement presheaves with [[sheaves]], we obtain the notion of _cosheaf_ on $C$:

$$
  [Sh(C), Set]_{coc} \simeq CoSh(C)
  \,.
$$

## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn #cosheaf}
###### Definition

Let $C$ be a [[site]]. A **cosheaf** on $C$ is a [[copresheaf]]

$$
  F : C \to Set
$$

such that it takes [[cover]]s to [[colimit]]s: for each covering family $\{U_i \to U\}$ in $C$ we have

$$
  F(U) \simeq \lim_{\to}
  \left(
     \coprod_{i j} F(U_i \times_{U} U_j)
     \stackrel{\to}{\to}
     \coprod_i F(U_i)
  \right)
$$


Write $CoSh(C) \subset CoPSh(C)$ for the full [[subcategory]] of cosheaves.

## Proposition

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

There is a [[natural transformation|natural]] [[equivalence of categories]]

$$
  CoSh(C) \simeq Func_{coc}(Sh(C), Set)
  \,,
$$

where on the left we have the category of cosheaves from def. \ref{cosheaf} and on the right we have the category of [[colimit]]-preserving functors on the [[sheaf topos]] of $C$.

Equivalently: a copresheaf is a cosheaf precisely if its [[Yoneda extension]] $PSh(C) \to Set$ factors through the [[sheafification]] functor $PSh(C) \to Sh(C)$.

This is ([Bunge-Funk 06, prop. 1.4.3](BungeFunk)).


## Examples

### In AQFT and higher AQFT

Cosheaves of [[algebras]], or notions similar to this, appear in [[AQFT]] as [[local nets of observables]]. Similar structures in [[higher category theory]] are _[[factorization algebras]]_, _[[factorization homology]]_, and _[[topological chiral homology]]_. Notably the definition of _[[factorization algebra]]_ typically explicitly involves the notion of cosheaf.
