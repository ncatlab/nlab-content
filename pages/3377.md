## Idea

A _Higgs bundle_ is a [[holomorphic bundle|holomorphic]] [[vector bundle]] $E$ together with a [[differential form|1-form]] $\Phi$ with values in the [[endomorphisms]] of (the [[fibers]] of) $E$, such that $\Phi \wedge \Phi = 0$.

The term was introduced by [[Nigel Hitchin]] as a reference to roughly analogous structures in the [[standard model of particle physics]] related to the _[[Higgs field]]_.

Higgs bundles play a central role in [[nonabelian Hodge theory]].

## Definition

Let $\mathcal{E}$ be a [[sheaf]] of [[section]]s of a holomorphic [[bundle]] $E$ on [[complex manifold]] $M$ with [[structure sheaf]] $\mathcal{O}_M$ and [[module]] of [[Kähler differential]]s $\Omega^1_M$. 

A **Higgs field** on $\mathcal{E}$ is an $\mathcal{O}_M$-linear map

$$
  \Phi : \mathcal{E}\to \Omega^1_M\otimes_{\mathcal{O}_M}\mathcal{E}
$$

satisfying the integrability condition $\Phi\wedge\Phi = 0$. The pair of data $(E,\Phi)$ is then called a **Higgs bundle**. 

Higgs bundle can be considered as a limiting case of a [[curvature|flat]] [[connection on a bundle|connection]] in the limit in which its exterior differential tends to zero, be obtained by rescaling. So the equation $d u/dz = A(z)u$ where $A(z)$ is a matrix of connection can be rescaled by putting a small parameter in front of $d u/dz$. 

## Properties

### Stability

For a Higgs bundle to admit a harmonic metric (...) it needs to be _stable_ (...).

### In nonabelian Hodge theory

In [[nonabelian Hodge theory]] the [[moduli space]] of stable Higgs bundles overa [[Riemann surface]] $X$ is identified with that of  [[special linear group]] $SL(n,\mathbb{C})$ [[irreducible representations]] of its [[fundamental group]] $\pi_1(X)$.

## Examples

### Rank 1

In the special case that $E$ has [[rank]] 1, hence is a [[line bundle]], the form $\Phi$ is simply any holomorphic 1-form. This case is also called that of an **abelian Higgs bundle**.

## References

The [[moduli space]] of Higgs bundles over an [[algebraic curve]] is one of the principal topics in works of [[Nigel Hitchin]] and [[Carlos Simpson]] in late 1980-s and 1990-s (and later Ron Donagi, Tony Pantev...).
