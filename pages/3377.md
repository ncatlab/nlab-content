Let $\mathcal{E}$ be a [[sheaf]] of [[section]]s of a holomorphic [[bundle]] $E$ on [[complex manifold]] $M$ with [[structure sheaf]] $\mathcal{O}_M$ and [[module]] of [[Kähler differential]]s $\Omega^1_M$. 

A **Higgs field** on $\mathcal{E}$ is an $\mathcal{O}_M$-linear map

$$
  \Phi : \mathcal{E}\to \Omega^1_M\otimes_{\mathcal{O}_M}\mathcal{E}
$$

satisfying the integrability condition $\Phi\wedge\Phi = 0$. The pair of data $(E,\Phi)$ is then called a **Higgs bundle**. 

Higgs bundle can be considered as a limiting case of a flat connection in the limit in which its exterior differential tends to zero, what can be obtained by rescaling. So the equation $du/dz = A(z)u$ where $A(z)$ is a matrix of connection can be rescaled by putting a small parameter in front of $du/dz$. 

Moduli space of Higgs bundles over an algebraic curve is one of the principal topics in works of [[Nigel Hitchin]] and [[Carlos Simpson]] in late 1980-s and 1990-s (and later Ron Donagi, Tony Pantev...).
