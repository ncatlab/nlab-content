## Idea

A _Higgs bundle_ is a [[holomorphic vector bundle]] $E$ together with a [[differential form|1-form]] $\Phi$ with values in the [[endomorphisms]] of (the [[fibers]] of) $E$, such that $\Phi \wedge \Phi = 0$.

Higgs bundles play a central role in [[nonabelian Hodge theory]].


## Terminology
 {#Terminology}

The term was introduced by [[Nigel Hitchin]] as a reference to roughly analogous structures in the [[standard model of particle physics]] related to the _[[Higgs field]]_.

> ([Witten 08, remark 2.1](#Witten08)): As an aside, one may ask how closely related $\phi$, known in the present context as the Higgs field, is to the Higgs fields of [[standard model of particle physics|particle physics]]. Thus, to what extent is the terminology that was introduced in Hitchin (1987a) actually justified? The main difference is that [[Higgs fields]] in particle physics are [[scalar fields]], while $\phi$ is a {[differential 1-form|one-form]] on $C$ (valued in each case in some [[representation]] of the [[gauge group]]). However, although Hitchin’s equations were first written down and studied directly, they can be obtained from [[N=4 D=4 super Yang-Mills theory|N = 4 supersymmetric gauge theory]] via a sort of twisting procedure (similar to the procedure that leads from N = 2 supersymmetric gauge theory to Donaldson theory). In this twisting procedure, some of the Higgs-like scalar fields of $N = 4$ super Yang-Mills theory are indeed converted into the Higgs field that enters in Hitchin’s equations. This gives a reasonable justification for the terminology.

## Definition

### In components

Let $\mathcal{E}$ be a [[sheaf]] of [[section]]s of a [[holomorphic vector bundle]] $E$ on [[complex manifold]] $M$ with [[structure sheaf]] $\mathcal{O}_M$ and [[module]] of [[Kähler differential]]s $\Omega^1_M$. 

A **Higgs field** on $\mathcal{E}$ is an $\mathcal{O}_M$-linear map

$$
  \Phi : \mathcal{E}\to \Omega^1_M\otimes_{\mathcal{O}_M}\mathcal{E}
$$

satisfying the integrability condition $\Phi\wedge\Phi = 0$. The pair of data $(E,\Phi)$ is then called a **Higgs bundle**. 

(Notice that this is similar to but crucially different the definition of a [[flat connection]] on a [[vector bundle]]. For that the map $\Phi$ is just $\mathbb{C}$-linear and the integrability condiiton is $\mathbf{d}\phi + \Phi\wedge\Phi = 0$.)

Higgs bundles can be considered as a limiting case of a [[curvature|flat]] [[connection on a bundle|connection]] in the limit in which its exterior differential tends to zero, be obtained by rescaling. So the equation $d u/dz = A(z)u$ where $A(z)$ is a matrix of connection can be rescaled by putting a small parameter in front of $d u/dz$. 

### Formulation in D-geometry

Analogous to how the [[de Rham stack]] $\int_{inf} X = X_{dR}$ of $X$ is the ([[homotopy quotient|homotopy]]) [[quotient]] of $X$ by the first order [[infinitesimal neighbourhood]] of the [[diagonal]] in $X \times X$, so there is a space ([[stack]]) $X_{Dol}$ which is the formal competion of the 0-section of the [[tangent bundle]] of $X$ ([Simpson 96](#Simpson96)).

Now a [[flat vector bundle]] on $X$ is essentially just a [[vector bundle]] on the [[de Rham stack]] $X_{dR}$, and a [[Higgs bundle]] is essentially just a [[vector bundle]] on $X_{Dol}$. Therefore in this language the nonabelian Hodge theorem reads (for $G$ a linear [[algebraic group]] over $\mathbb{C}$)

$$
  \mathbf{H}(X_{dR}, \mathbf{B}G)
  \simeq
  \mathbf{H}(X_{Dol}, \mathbf{B}G)^{ss,0}
  \,,
$$

where the superscript on the right denotes restriction to semistable Higgs bundles with vanishing [[first Chern class]] (see [Raboso 14, theorem 4.2](#Raboso14)). 


## Properties

### Stability

For a Higgs bundle to admit a harmonic metric (...) it needs to be _stable_ (...).

### In nonabelian Hodge theory

In [[nonabelian Hodge theory]] the [[moduli space]] of stable Higgs bundles overa [[Riemann surface]] $X$ is identified with that of  [[special linear group]] $SL(n,\mathbb{C})$ [[irreducible representations]] of its [[fundamental group]] $\pi_1(X)$.

## Examples

### Rank 1

In the special case that $E$ has [[rank]] 1, hence is a [[line bundle]], the form $\Phi$ is simply any holomorphic 1-form. This case is also called that of an **abelian Higgs bundle**.

### Bundles of holomorphic forms

Let $X$ be a [[complex manifold]] and $\omega \in \Omega^{k,0}(X)$ for odd $k$. Then $\Omega^{\bullet,0}(X)$ becomes a Higgs bundle when equipped with the endomorphis-valued 1-form which sends a holomorphic vector $v$ to the wedge product operation with the contraction of $\omega$ with $v$.

This is discussed in ([Seaman 98](#Seaman98))
