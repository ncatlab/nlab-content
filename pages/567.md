## Idea

A _dual adjunction_ between [[category|categories]] $C$ and $D$ is an [[adjoint functor|adjunction]] between the [[opposite category]] $C^{op}$ of $C$ and $D$.

The concept arises in the context of [[duality]].

Dual adjunctions between [[concrete category|concrete categories]] are frequently represented by [[dualizing objects]].

Dual adjunctions between [[posets]] are also called _[[Galois connections]]_.

## Definition 

A _dual adjunction_ consists of [[contravariant functors]] $F: C \to D$, $G: D \to C$ together with natural transformations $\eta: 1_C \to G F$ and $\theta: 1_D \to F G$ such that $F \eta \circ \theta F = 1_F$ and $G \theta \circ \eta G = 1_G$. 

Reformulated in terms of covariant functors, a dual adjunction can be viewed as an ordinary adjunction $F \dashv G$ with $F: C \to D^{op}$ and $G: D^{op} \to C$, or as $G \dashv F$ with $G: D \to C^{op}$ and $F: C^{op} \to D$. However, it is often useful not to break the symmetry of the contravariant formulation. 

A _self-dual_ adjunction is a dual adjunction for which $F = G: C \to C$ and $\eta = \theta: 1 \to F F$. An example is where $C$ is a [[symmetric monoidal closed category]] and $F = [-, d]$ is an internal hom into an object $d$, where the unit is the usual double-dual embedding $\delta_c: c \to [[c, d], d]$.
