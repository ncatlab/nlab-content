[[c-structure]] for $c$ the 1st [[Pontryagin class]] $p_1$, o.e. trivialization of $p_1$.

In the presence of [[Spin structure]] then $p_1$-structure is also called _[[string structure]]_. In the presence of (just) [[orientation]] (i.e. [[w1-structure]]) on [[3-manifolds]] then $p_1$-structure is closely related to [[Atiyah 2-framing]] structure.
