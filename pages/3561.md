A __partial equivalence relation__ is a binary relation satisfying the [[symmetric relation|symmetry]] and [[transitive relation|transitivity]] conditions of an [[equivalence relation]], but not necessarily the [[reflexive relation|reflexivity]] condition. That is, a partial equivalence relation on $X$ is a binary relation $R(x, y) \subseteq X^2$ such that for all $x$ and $y$ in $X$, $R(x, y)$ implies $R(y, x)$, and for all $x$, $y$, and $z$ in $X$, $R(x, y)$ and $R(y, z)$ together imply $R(x, z)$.

Just as predicates on a set $X$ correspond to [[subset]]s of $X$ and equivalence relations on $X$ correspond to [[quotient object|quotient]]s of $X$, partial equivalence relations on $X$ correspond to [[subquotient]]s of $X$ (the elements satisfying $R(x, x)$ comprise a subset of $X$, on which the relation restricts to a total equivalence relation specifying a further quotient).
