## Definitions

A __partial equivalence relation__ is a [[binary relation]] satisfying the [[symmetric relation|symmetry]] and [[transitive relation|transitivity]] conditions of an [[equivalence relation]], but not necessarily the [[reflexive relation|reflexivity]] condition. That is, a partial equivalence relation on $X$ is a binary relation $R(x, y) \subseteq X^2$ such that for all $x$ and $y$ in $X$, $R(x, y)$ implies $R(y, x)$, and for all $x$, $y$, and $z$ in $X$, $R(x, y)$ and $R(y, z)$ together imply $R(x, z)$.

Just as [[unary relations]] on a set $X$ correspond to [[subsets]] of $X$ and equivalence relations on $X$ correspond to [[quotient set|quotients]] of $X$, so partial equivalence relations on $X$ correspond to [[subquotients]] of $X$.  That is, the elements satisfying $R(x, x)$ comprise a subset of $X$, on which the relation restricts to a total equivalence relation specifying a further quotient.


## Examples

Consider the set $X$ of all [[infinite sequences]] of [[rational numbers]].  Let such sequences $x$ and $y$ be related if
$$ \lim_{i,j\to \infty} {|x_i - y_j|} = 0 .$$
Then this defines a partial equivalence relation $R$ on $X$; the corresponding subquotient of $X$ is the set of [[Cauchy real numbers]].  Normally, this definition of real number is split into two parts: those sequences satsifying the reflexivity condition of $R$ are the [[Cauchy sequences]] of rational numbers (under the absolute-value metric), and then we impose a total equivalence relation on the Cauchy sequences.  But a single partial equivalence relation does all of the work.  (This example generalises in the usual ways.)
