## Idea

In the context of [[étale cohomology]] of [[schemes]], the _Artin comparison theorem_ ([Artin 66](#Artin66)) says that under some conditions on a [[scheme]] and a [[sheaf]] of [[coefficient]],  the [[étale cohomology]] of the scheme coincides with the [[ordinary cohomology]] (e.g. [[singular cohomology]]) of its underlying [[topological space]].

Historically this kind of statement was a central motivation for the development of [[étale cohomology]] in the first place.
