## Idea

What is called _inhomogeneous cosmology_ is the study of [[cosmology]] via cosmological solutions to [[Einstein's equations]], _without_ assuming or constraining these solutions to be spatially homogeneous (in the technical sense).

This is in contrast to the [[standard model of cosmology]], based on [[FRW model]]-type solutions to [[Einstein's equations]], where [[spacetime]] _is_ assumed to be spatially homogeneous. 

Of course the [[observable universe]] is clearly not _exactly_ homogeneous (due to initial [[CMB]] fluctuation and ensuing [[structure formation]]), but the question is whether on cosmic [[scales]] the deviation from homogeneity is small enough that it may be neglected, to first approximation, for the purpose of modelling cosmological evolution.

## Effective dark energy from inhomogeneity?

The [[standard model of cosmology]] assumes that such inhomogeneities may be neglected to zeroth order, and studies [[structure formation]] as a perturbation about a spatially homogeneous [[FRW model]] [[background field|background]] [[spacetime]].

Given that the [[standard model of cosmology]] faces some issues (e.g. [BCKRW 15](standard+model+of+cosmology#BCKRW15)) related to _[[dark energy]]_ (a [[cosmological constant]], and possibly related issues such as [[cosmic inflation]] or [[dark matter]]), it has been suggested that these may be but an artifact of the overly idealistic approximation of cosmic homogeneity, and that a more accurate inhomogeneous cosmology would not need to assume any [[dark energy]] (e.g. [Célérier 99](#Celerier00), [Alnes-Amarzguioui-Gron 06](#AlnesAmarzguiouiGron06), [Alnes-Amarzguioui 06](#AlnesAmarzguioui06), [Buchert-Larena-Alimi 06](#BuchertLarenaAlimi06), [Enqvist-Mattsson 06](#EnqvistMattsson06) [Buchert 07](#Buchert07), [Sarkar 08](#Sarkar08), [Buchert 11](#Buchert11), [Buchert-Rasanen 11](#BucherRasanen11), [Scharf 13](#Scharf13), [Moffat 16](#Moffat16)).

Inhomogeneity effects seen in numerical simulations are discussed in [Clesse-Roisin-Füzfa 17](#ClesseRoisinFufza17), [ACDDK 17](#ACDDK17).

Review of attitudes in the community towards this issues is in [Belejko-Korzyński 16](#BelejkoKorzynski16). 


If the apparent small positive [[cosmological constant]] ([[dark energy]]) were but an artifact of neglecting backreaction of inhomogeneities, some theoretical puzzlements regarding [[quantum gravity]] on [[de Sitter spacetimes]] would disappear (see [Rajaraman 16](de+Sitter+spacetime#Rajaraman16) for general discussion and [Danielsson-VanRiet 18, p. 27](#DanielssonVanRiet18) for discussion of [[perturbative string theory vacua]]).


## The "backreaction debate"
 {#BackreactionDebate}

A seminal argument that it _is_ consistent to neglect cosmic inhomogeneity was given by [Green-Wald 10](#GreenWald10), [Green-Wald 13](#GreenWald13). This was called into question in [Buchert et al. 15](#BuchertEtAl15), where it is concluded that the issue is more subtle and remains open. The reply to this criticism by [Green-Wald 15](#GreenWald15) is summarized in [Ostrowski-Roukema 15, p. 4](#OstrowskiRoukema15) as follows:

> Green and Wald state that their formalism does not apply to situations when

> $\ast$ the actual metric (e.g., at recent epochs) is far from FLRW; or

> $\ast$ one wishes to construct an effective metric (or other effective quantities) through some averaging procedure

> This, in principle, ends the debate about whether backreaction has been excluded as a dark energy candidate: the Green and Wald formalism does not apply to the main body of backreaction research; backreaction remains a viable dark energy candidate.

## Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi models
 {#LemaitreTolmanBondi}

A particular class of examples of inhomogeneous cosmological models are Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi models, which however require assuming that we inhabit a position close to a singled-out "center" of the universe, usually the center of an assumed cosmic "void", of low matter density. See e.g. [Moffat 05](#Moffat05), [Enkvist 07](#Enkvist07), [Moffat 16](#Moffat16). 

It has been argued (e.g. [Moffat 16, p. 2](#Moffat16)) that the apparent unlikeliness of such a "spatial coincidence" is relativized on the backdrop of the established "temporal coincidence" that cosmic acceleration seems to start roughly with the onset of [[structure formation]], and the perceived fine-tunig of the [[cosmological constant]] required in the [[standard model of cosmology]].
