## Idea

What is called _inhomogeneous cosmology_ is the study of [[cosmology]] via cosmological solutions to [[Einstein's equations]], _whithout_ assuming or constraining these solutions to be spatially homogeneous (in the technical sense).

This is in contrast to the [[standard model of cosmology]], based on [[FRW model]]-type solutions to [[Einstein's equations]], where [[spacetime]] _is_ assumed to be spatially homogeneous. 

Of course the [[observable universe]] is clearly not _exactly_ homogeneous, but the question is whether on cosmic [[scales]] the deviation from homogeneity is small enough that it may be neglected, to first approximation, for the purpose of modelling cosmological evolution.

The [[standard model of cosmology]] assumes that this is the case, and studies [[structure formation]] as a perturbation about a homogeneous [[background field|background]] [[spacetime]].

Given that the [[standard model of cosmology]] faces some issues related to _[[dark energy]]/[[cosmological constant]]_ (and possibly related issues such as [[cosmic inflation]] or [[dark matter]]), it has been suggested that these may be but an artifact of the overly idealistic approximation of cosmic homogeneity, and that a more accurate inhomogeneous cosmology would not need to assume any [[dark energy]] (e.g. [Buchert 07](#Buchert07), [Buchert 11](#Buchert11), [Buchert-Rasanen 11](#BucherRasanen11), [Scharf 13](#Scharf13)).

A seminal argument that it _is_ consistent to neglect cosmic inhomogeneity due to ([Green-Wald 10](#GreenWald10), [Green-Wald 13](#GreenWald13)), has been called into question in [Buchert et al. 15](#BuchertEtAl15), where it is concluded that the question is more subtle and remains open. Recent review is in [Belejko-Korzyński 16](#BelejkoKorzynski16).

If the apparent small positive [[cosmological constant]] were but an artifact of neglecting backreaction of inhomegeneities, some theoretical puzzlements regarding [[quantum gravity]] on [[de Sitter spacetimes]] would disappear (see [Rajaraman 16](de+Sitter+spacetime#Rajaraman16) for general discussion and [Danielsson-VanRiet 18, p. 27](#DanielssonVanRiet18) for discussion of [[perturbative string theory vacua]]).
