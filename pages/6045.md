## Idea

A _$B$-bordism_ is a [[cobordism]] $W$ equipped with extra "topological [[structure]]" in the form of a lift of the classifying map $W \to B O$ of its [[tangent bundle]] through some [[fibration]] $B \to B O$ over the [[classifying space]] of the [[orthogonal group]].

Commonly considered are lifts through the [[Whitehead tower]] of the [[orthogonal group]]), corresponding, in this order, to cobordisms with 

* [[spin structure]] - [[spin bordism]] 

* [[string structure]] - [[string bordism]] 

* [[fivebrane structure]] - [[fivebrane bordism]]

etc.
