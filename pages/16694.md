## Idea

A concept of _Weyl n-algebra_ is to be a refinement to [[higher algebra]] of the concept of _[[Weyl algebra]]_.

## Definitions

Since a traditional [[Weyl algebra]] is a [[universal enveloping algebra]] of a [[Heisenberg Lie algebra]] of a [[symplectic vector space]], and since there is a sensible notion of [[Heisenberg Lie n-algebra]], one may go and defne a _Weyl n-algebra_ to be a [[universal enveloping E-n algebra]] of a [[Heisenberg Lie n-algebra]].

Another definition is considered in ([Markarian 15](#Markarian15)).
