The most classical coherent states are the elements in $L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$ which are eigenfunctions $|z\rangle = |z_1,\ldots,z_n\rangle$ of the annihilation operators $a_i$, i=1,ldots,n$; the eigenvalues $z_i$ are complex numbers and all complex numbers appear in that way; more precisely the coherent states are parametrized by numbers $z=(z_1,\ldots,z_n)$ in $\mathbb{C}^n$, and there is a measure $d\mu$ on $\mathbb{C}^n$ providing the resolution of unity formula
$$
\int_{\mathbb{C}^n} |z><z| d\mu = 1
$$
Coherent states however are not mutually orthogonal; they form an overcomplete family of states: not only that every vector in $L^2$ can be expressed in terms of them but rather in more than one way and we can throw certain coherent states out and not to spoil the property (how many and which is a more subtle question). Thus expressing states in terms of coherent states is sort of Fourier analysis; in fact this approach is taken in a variant called wavelet analysis.
