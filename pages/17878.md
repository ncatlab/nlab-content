## Definition

A _differential graded-commutative algebra_ (also _CDGA_, for short) is a [[differential-graded algebra]] which is [[supercommutative superalgebras|supercommutative]] in that for $v,w$ any two elements in homogeneous degree $deg(v), deg(w) \in \mathbb{Z}$, respectively, then  the product in the algebra satisfies

$$
  v w \;=\; (-1)^{deg(v) deg(w)} w v 
  \,.
$$

Equivalently this is a [[commutative monoid]] in the [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal]] [[category of chain complexes]] equipped with the [[tensor product of chain complexes]].
