## Definition

A [[3-manifold|3-dimensional]] [[submanifold]] $\Sigma_3 \hookrightarrow X_7$ of a [[G2-manifold]] $X_7$ is called _associative_ if it is a [[calibrated submanifold]], hence if the canonical 3-form $\phi$ of the $G_2$-manifold (tangent space-wise the [[associative 3-form]]) restricts to the [[volume form]] on $\Sigma_3$.

Accordingly a [[4-manifold|4-dimensional]] [[submanifold]] $\Sigma_4 \hookrightarrow X_7$ is called _coassociative_ if it is a [[calibrated submanifold]] with respect to the coassicative 4-form $\star_X \phi$.


## Application in string theory

In [[M-theory on G2-manifolds]], 

* associatvce 3-manifold appear as [[supersymmetric cycles]] relevant for [[membrane instantons]] for [[M2-branes]] [[wrapped brane|wrapping them]];

* coassociative 4-manifolds appear as fibers of compactifications dual to [[F-theory on CY4-folds]] ([Gukov-Yau-Zaslow 02](#GukovYauSaslow02)).
