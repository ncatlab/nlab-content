## Idea

The concept of _amplimorphism_ is a way to present [[bimodules]] in terms of linear maps.

For $A$ an [[associative algebra]] (not necessarily unital) over some [[ring]] $R$ (possibly with extra structure, in applications often a [[C*-algebra]]) then an _amplimorphism_ from $A$ to $A$ is an algebra homomorphism of the form

$$
  \alpha \;\colon\; A \longrightarrow A \otimes_R Mat_n(R) \simeq Mat_n(A)
$$

for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $Mat_n(R)$ the ring of [[matrices]] with [[coefficients]] in $R$ under [[matrix multiplication]].

This map induces the $R$-[[bimodules]] $N_\alpha \subset A \otimes R^n$ on elements $N_\alpha = \{\psi \;|\;  \alpha(1)\psi = \psi\}$ with left $A$-action given by $\alpha$ and right $A$ action given by componentwise multiplication with $A$ from the right. 

(If $R = \mathbb{C}$ and $A$ is a [[C*-algebra]] then this is canonically equipped with the structure of a [[Hilbert bimodule]]).
