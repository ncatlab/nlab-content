## Idea

_Differential homotopy type theory_ is the [[modal type theory]] obtained by adding to [[cohesive homotopy type theory]] an [[adjoint triple]] of [[idempotent monad|idempotent (co)monadic]] [[modalities]]:

$$
  \Re \dashv \Im \dashv \&
$$

called

* [[reduction modality]] $\dashv$ [[infinitesimal shape modality]] $\dashv$ [[infinitesimal flat modality]].


By the discussion at _[[cohesive (infinity,1)-topos -- infinitesimal cohesion]]_ this language can express at least the following notions

* [[reduced type]], [[infinitesimal path ∞-groupoid]], [[de Rham space]], [[jet bundle]], [[D-geometry]], [[∞-Lie algebra]] (synthetically), [[Lie differentiation]], hence "Formal [[Moduli Problems and DG-Lie Algebras]]" , [[formally etale morphism]], [[formally smooth morphism]], [[formally unramified morphism]], [[smooth etale ∞-groupoid]], hence [[∞-orbifold]] etc.
