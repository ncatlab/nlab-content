## Idea

A [[connected topological space|connected]] [[topological space]] $x$ is called _nilpotent_ if 

1. its [[fundamental group]] $\pi_1(X)$ is a [[nilpotent group]];

1. the [[action]] of $\pi_1(X)$ on the higher [[homotopy groups]] is nilpotent in that...

## Properties

### Rational nilpotent spaces

The central statement of [[rational homotopy theory]] says that the [[rational homotopy type]] of nilpotent topological spaces of [[finite type]] is equivalently reflected in [[nilpotent L-infinity algebras]] of finite type.
