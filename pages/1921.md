A **semigroup** is a set equipped with a binary associative operation.  

[[category theory|Category theorists]] sometimes look with scorn on semigroups, because unlike a [[monoid]], a semigroup is not an example of a category.

However, semigroup can be promoted to a monoid by adjoining a new element and decreeing it to be the identity.  This gives a full and faithful functor from the category of semigroups (with the obvious morphisms) to the category of monoids.  So, a semigroup can actually be seen as a monoid with an extra property.

**Exercise**: what is this property?

We can [[internalization|internalize]] the concept of semigroup in any [[monoidal category]].

Whoops!!  Sorry for this page.
