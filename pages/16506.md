## Idea

In a [[cartesian closed category]]/[[type theory]] $\mathcal{C}$, given any [[object]]/[[type]] $W$ there is a [[monad]]

$$
  [W,-] \colon \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}
$$

given by forming the [[internal hom]] out of $W$, hence the "space of functions" out of $W$. This is sometimes called the _function monad_.  Its [[unit of a monad]] is given by sending values to [[constant functions]] with that value, and the monad operation is given by evaluating on the [[diagonal]].

In the context of [[monads in computer science]] this monad is called the _reader monad_ or _environmen monad_. It serves write programs in which all operations may "read in" a state of type $W$ (an "environment").

## Properties

### Relation to the writer comonad and state monad

In a [[cartesian closed category]]/[[type theory]] $\mathcal{C}$,
the reader monad $[W,-] \colon \mathcal{C}\to \mathcal{C}$ is [[right adjoint]] to the [[writer comonad]] $W\times (-)$.

The composite of writer comonad followed by [[reader monad]] is the [[state monad]].

### In terms of dependent type theory
 {#InTermsOfDependentTypeTheory}

If the type system is even a [[locally Cartesian closed category]]/[[dependent type theory]] then for each type $W$ there is the [[base change]] [[adjoint triple]]

$$
  \mathcal{C}_{/W}
    \stackrel{\overset{\sum_W}{\longrightarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{W^\ast}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{\prod_W}{\longrightarrow}}}
  \mathcal{C}
$$

In terms of this then the function monad is equivalently the composite

$$
  \prod_W W^\ast = [W,-] \;\colon\; \mathcal{C} \longrightarrow \mathcal{C}
$$

of [[context extension]] followed by [[dependent product]].

(Notice that the [[comonad]] obtained by composing the other way around, $W^\ast \prod_W$, is the [[modal operator]] usually called _[[necessity]]_.)


### Relation to random variables in probability theory
 {#RelationToRandomVariables}

It makes sense to think of $[W,-]$ as producing spaces of [[random variables]] ([Verdier 14](#Verdier14)) depending on [[possible worlds]] $w\in W$ ([Toronto-McCarthy 10b, slide 24](#TorontoMcCarthy10b)). 

>  The intuition behind the Reader monad, for a mathematician, is perhaps stochastic variables. A stochastic variable is a function from a probability space to some other space. So we see a stochastic variable as a monadic value. ([Verdier 14](#Verdier14))

> you could interpret this by regarding random variables as reader monad computations. ([Toronto-McCarthy 10b, slide 35](#TorontoMcCarthy10b))

[Toronto-McCarthy 10a, 2.2](#TorontoMcCarthy10a), [Toronto 14, 6.2](#Toronto14) call the function monad the _random variable idiom_.

(While, from the perspective of [[modal type theory]], its siblings $W^\ast \prod_W$ and $W^\ast \sum_W$ may be called _[[necessity]]_ and _[[possibility]]_, respectively).

In [[Haskell]], the traditional way to model that a program may depend on random states $w \in W$ is to consider not the reader monad but the [[state monad]] $[W,W \times (-)]$. This allows programs not only to depend on the state $w\in W$, but also to change it (for instance to a new number generated by a random number generator). If however one restricts attention to programs that just depend on/read in a random environment $w\in W$ but never change it, then these standard constructs may be reduced from using the state monad to using just the reader monad.
