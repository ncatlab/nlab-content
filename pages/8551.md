## Idea

An algebraic curve is an [[algebraic variety]] of dimension $1$. Typically
one restricts considerations to either affine or projective algebraic curves. Most often one treats the plane algebraic curves, i.e. curves
with an embedding into $\mathbf{A}^2$ or $\mathbf{P}^2$; they are the locus of solutions of a single algebraic equation.

An _algebraic curve_ over a [[field]] $F$ is the locus of solutions of $(n-1)$-[[polynomials]] in $n$-[[variables]] of [[type]] $F$, provided the 
Krull dimension of the ring is $1$.


## Properties

### General

* Every projective algebraic curve is [[birationally equivalent]] to a plane algebraic curve
* [[Mordell conjecture]]: every algebraic curve of genus $g\geq 2$ defined over rationals has at least one point over rationals
* To a nonsingular curve $C$ over the field of complex numbers one associates an [[abelian variety]], namely its [[Jacobian variety]] together with the period map or Abel-Jacobi map $C\to J(C)$.
