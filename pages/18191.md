

A _solution_ to an [[equation]] $f(x) = g(x)$ is a choice of value $v$ for the [[free variable]] $x$ such that the statement $f(v) = g(v)$ becomes [[true]].

If we think of the equation as embodied by a pair of [[parallel morphisms]]

$$
  X_1 \underoverset{\underset{f_2}{\longrightarrow}}{\overset{f_2}{\longrightarrow}}{\phantom{AAAA}} X_2
$$

then a solution is a [[cone]] over this [[diagram]]. The solution space itself is the [[limit]] [[cone]], hence the [[equalizer]] of the diagram.
