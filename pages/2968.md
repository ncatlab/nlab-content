A continuous map $p:E\to B$ of topological space satisfies the **homotopy lifting property** (or *covering homotopy property*) with respect to space $Y$ if for every commuting square in $Top$ as drawn in solid lines 

$$
  \array{
    Y &\stackrel{f}\to& E
    \\
    \downarrow^{\sigma_0} &{}^{\tilde{F}}\nearrow&  \downarrow^p
    \\
    Y\times I &\stackrel{F}{\to}& B
  }
  \,.
$$

there is a diagonal such that the entire diagram commutes. Map $\sigma_0:Y\to Y\times I$ is given by $y\mapsto (y,0)$ for $y\in Y$.

A map $p$ is a [[Hurewicz fibration]] if it satisfies the homotopy lifting property with respect to all spaces $X$. A map $p$ is a **Serre fibration** if it satisfies the homotopy lifting property with respect to all disks. 

Homotopy lifting property is an instance of a [[right lifting property]]. 

The Eckman-Hilton dual of the homotopy lifting property is the [[homotopy extension property]].
