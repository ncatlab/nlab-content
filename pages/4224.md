## Idea

Stone duality is a subject comprising various [[dualities]] between [[space and quantity]] in the area of general topology and topological algebra.

## Particular cases

### Locales and frames

Perhaps the most generality duality falling under this heading is that between [[locales]] (on the [[space]] side) and [[frames]] (on the [[quantity]] side).  Of course, this duality is not very deep at all; the category [[Loc]] of locales is simply *defined* to be the [[opposite category|opposite]] of the category [[Frm]] of frames.  But there are several interesting dualities between [[subcategories]] of these.

### Topological spaces

Stone duality is often described for [[topological spaces]] rather than for [[locales]].  In this case, the most general duality is that between [[sober spaces]] and frames with enough points (which correspond to [[topological locale]]s).  In many cases, one requires the [[ultrafilter theorem]] (or other forms of the [[axiom of choice]]) in order for the duality to hold when applied to topological spaces, while the duality holds for locales even in [[constructive mathematics]].

### Coherent spaces and distributive lattices

Any [[distributive lattice]] generates a [[free object|free]] frame.  The locales which arise in this way can be characterized as the [[coherent locale]]s, and this gives a duality between distributive lattices and coherent locales.  Note that one must additionally restrict to "coherent maps" between coherent locales.  Also, at least assuming the [[axiom of choice]], every coherent locale is [[topological locale|topological]], so we may say "coherent space" instead.

### Stone spaces and Boolean algebras

The duality which is due to [[Marshall Stone]], and which gives its name to the subject, is the duality between [[Stone spaces]] and [[Boolean algebras]].  Specifically, a distributive lattice is a Boolean algebra precisely when the free frame it generates is the topology of a Stone space, and any continuous map of Stone spaces is coherent.  Therefore, the category of Stone spaces is dual to the category of Boolean algebras.  The Boolean algebra corresponding to a Stone space consists of its [[clopen sets]].

### Stone spaces and profinite sets

Note that a finite Stone space is necessarily discrete, and these correspond to the finite Boolean algebras, i.e. $FinSet \simeq FinStoneTop \simeq FinBool^{op}$.  However, since Boolean algebras form a [[locally finitely presentable category]], we have $Bool \simeq Ind(FinBool) \simeq Pro(FinSet)^{op}$ (see [[ind-object]] and [[pro-object]]).  In consequence, $StoneTop \simeq Pro(FinSet)$: i.e. [[Stone spaces]] are equivalent to *profinite sets*.

### Profinite algebras

If $T$ is a [[Lawvere theory]] on $Set$, we can talk about *Stone $T$-algebras*, i.e. $T$-algebras with a compatible Stone topology, and compare the resulting category $T Alg(Stone)$ with the category $Pro(Fin T Alg)$ of pro-(finite $T$-algebras).  The previous duality says that these categories are equivalent when $T$ is the identity theory.  It is also true in many other cases, such as:

* the theory of [[groups]], resulting in the rich theory of [[profinite groups]]
* the theories of [[semigroups]] and [[monoids]]
* the theory of [[rings]] (with or without 1)
* the theories of [[distributive lattices]], [[Heyting algebras]], and [[Boolean algebras]]
* the theory of $M$-sets, where $M$ is a finite monoid
* the theories of $R$-modules and $R$-algebras, where $R$ is a finite ring

However it is false for some $T$, such as:

* the theory of $\mathbb{N}$-sets, i.e. sets equipped with an endomorphism
* the theory of [[Jonsson-Tarski algebras]]
* the theory of [[lattices]]

All of these can be found in chapter VI of Johnstone's book cited below.

The corresponding fact is also notably false for [[groupoids]], i.e. $Gpd(Stone)$ is not equivalent to $Pro(FinGpd)$, in contrast to the case for groups.  (Of course, groupoids are not described by a Lawvere theory.)
