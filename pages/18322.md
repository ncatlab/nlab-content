In this article we collect some results on colimits of paracompact spaces as computed in the category of topological spaces $Top$, and particular conditions under which the colimit is again paracompact. 

The account is designed to be wholly parallel to that given in [[colimits of normal spaces]], centering particularly on how paracompactness may be reformulated in terms of an extension or selection property. The relevant result, due to Ernest Michael, is particularly well-adapted to the study of colimits. 

## Michael's selection characterization of paracompactness 

It is well-known that a space $X$ is paracompact iff every open cover of $X$ admits a subordinate partition of unity. Michael's innovation was in figuring out how the partition of unity characterization may be recast in terms of existence of continuous sections of suitable projection maps. 

Recall that a [[relation]] in a [[category]] is a jointly monic [[span]] 

$$\array{
 & & R & & \\ 
 & \mathllap{p} \swarrow & & \searrow \mathrlap{q} & \\ 
X & & & & Y
}$$ 

and that the relation is [[entire relation|entire]] if $p$ is an [[epimorphism]]. We will be working in the category $Top$, where epimorphisms are the same as surjective continuous functions. A *selection* for such a relation is by definition a [[section]] of $p$, where of course in $Top$ this means a continuous section. (In the category $Set$, the [[axiom of choice]] may be equivalently stated as saying that every entire relation admits a selection, a formulation which is sometimes credited to Peirce.) 

If $X$ is a space, let $\mathcal{O} X$ denote its topology, considered as a subset of the power set $P X$. Adapting the terminology of Michael, we will say a relation $X \stackrel{p}{\leftarrow} R \stackrel{q}{\to} Y$ is *lsc* ("lower semi-continuous") if the composite 

$$P Y \stackrel{q^\ast}{\to} P R \stackrel{\exists_p}{\to} P X$$ 

restricts to a map $\exists_p q^\ast: \mathcal{O} Y \to \mathcal{O} X$. In more down-to-earth terms, this says that $\{x \in X: \exists_y \; R(x, y) \wedge y \in V\}$ is open in $X$ whenever $V$ is open in $Y$. 

Let $Y$ be a Banach space (for example, $Y$ could be $L^1(S)$, the Banach space freely generated by a set $S$ such as $S = \mathcal{U}$, an open cover of a given space $X$). We will say an (entire) relation $(R, p, q)$ from $X$ to $Y$ in $Top$ is *closed and convex* if for each $x \in X$ the fiber $R_x = p^{-1}(x)$ is a closed convex subset of $Y$.

###### Theorem 
**(E. Michael's selection theorem)** 
A space $X$ is paracompact iff for every Banach space $Y$, every entire, lsc, closed and convex relation $(R, p, q)$ from $X$ to $Y$ admits a selection.
