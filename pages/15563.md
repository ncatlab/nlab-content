## Idea

One proposal for a precise realization of the idea of "absolute" [[arithmetic geometry]] over [[F1|Spec(F1)]] is _Borger's absolute geometry_ ([Borger 09](#Borger09)). Here the structure of a [[Lambda-ring]] on a ring $R$, hence $Spec(R) \to Spec(\mathbb{Z})$  is interpreted as a collection of lifts of all [[Frobenius morphisms]] and hence as [[descent]] data for descent to $Spec(\mathbb{F}_1)$ (which is defined thereby).  This definition yields an [[essential geometric morphism]] of [[gros topos|gros]] [[etale toposes]]

$$
  Et(Spec(\mathbb{Z}))
   \stackrel{\overset{}{\longrightarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{}{\longrightarrow}}}
  Et(Spec(\mathbb{F}_1))
  \,,
$$

where on the right the notation is just suggestive, the [[topos]] is a suitable one over [[Lambda-rings]]. Here the middle [[inverse image]] is the [[forgetful functor]] which forgets the Lambda structure, and its [[right adjoint]] [[direct image]] is given by the [[ring of Witt vectors]] construction and may be thought of as producing [[arithmetic jet spaces]].

This proposal seems to subsume many aspects of other existing proposals (see e.g. [Le Bruyn 13](#LeBruyn13)) and stands out as yielding an "absolute [[base topos]]" $Et(Spec(\mathbb{F}_1))$ which is rich and genuinely interesting in its own right.

## Definition

> under construction

Write [[CRing]] for the [[category]] of (finitely generated) [[commutative rings]]and $\Lambda Ring$ for that of [[Lambda-rings]].

By the discussion at _[here](Lambda-ring#FreeAndCofreeLambdaRings)_
the [[forgetful functor]]
$U \;\colon\; \Lambda Ring \longrightarrow CRing$
from [[Lambda-rings]] to [[commutative rings]] has 

* a [[left adjoint]], given by forming the ring $Symm$ of [[symmetric functions]];

* a [[right adjoint]] given by forming the [[ring of Witt vectors]] $W$.

$$
  (Symm \dashv U \dashv W)
  \;\colon\;
  \Lambda Ring
   \stackrel{\overset{Symm}{\leftarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{U}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{W}{\leftarrow}}}
  CRing
  \,.
$$

Hence 

* [[rings of Witt vectors]] are the _[[co-free functors|co-free]] Lambda-rings;

* rings of [[symmetric functions]] are the [[free construction|free]] Lambda-rings.

Write $Spec(\mathbb{Z})_{et}$ for $CRing^{op}$ equipped with the [[etale topology]]. Hence

$$
  Et(Spec(\mathbb{Z}))
  \coloneqq
  Sh(Spec(\mathbb{Z})_{et})
$$

is the [[gros topos|gros]] [[etale topos]] of [[arithmetic geometry]]. 

Put a compatible [[Grothendieck topology]] on $\Lambda Ring^{op}$(...) and write the resulting [[site]] $Spec(\mathbb{F}_1)_{et}$.

In analogy we write

$$
  Et(Spec(\mathbb{F}_1))
  \coloneqq
  Sh(Spec(\mathbb{F}_1)_{et})
$$

and speak of the "[[etale topos]] over $Spec(\mathbb{F}_1)$", or the "absolute [[base topos]]" or something like this. 

> ah, maybe this differs from what Borger does. Check.




The above [[adjoint triple]] induces an adjoint quadruple of functions on the [[categories of presheaves]]

$$
  PSh(Spec(\mathbb{Z})_{et})
  \stackrel{\longleftarrow}\stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\stackrel{\longleftarrow}{\stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longleftarrow}}}
  PSh(Spec(\mathbb{F}_1)_{et})
$$

The middle three of these restrict to sheaves, Borger shows. 
But then so will the top one (...)

$$
  Et(Spec(\mathbb{Z}))
  =
  Sh(Spec(\mathbb{Z})_{et})
  \stackrel{\longleftarrow}\stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\stackrel{\longleftarrow}{\stackrel{\longrightarrow}{}}}
  Sh(Spec(\mathbb{F}_1)_{et})
  =
  Et(Spec(\mathbb{F}_1))
$$
