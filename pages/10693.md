### Classical definition
 {#ClassicalDefinition}

For $X$ a [[spectrum]] and $E^\bullet$ a [[generalized cohomology theory]] [[Brown representability theorem|represented]] by a [[spectrum]] $E$, then an _$E$-Adams resolution_ of $X$ is a [[diagram]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    \vdots
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    F_2 &\stackrel{f_2}{\longrightarrow}& K_2
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    F_1 &\stackrel{f_1}{\longrightarrow}& K_1
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
     X &\stackrel{f_0}{\longrightarrow}& K_0
  }
$$

where 

* each $K_i$ is a [[smash product]] of [[suspensions]] of $E$;

* each $F_{n+1} \to F_n \to K_n$ is a [[homotopy fiber sequence]];

* each $f_n$ is a surjection on [[cohomology]].

The original and default case is that where $E = H \mathbb{F}_p$ is an [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum]] with mod $p$ [[coefficients]], in which case $E^\bullet$ is [[ordinary cohomology]] with these coefficients.
In this case the $K_i$ are [[generalized Eilenberg-MacLane spectra]].

The [[long exact sequences of homotopy groups]] for all the [[homotopy fibers]] in this diagram arrange into a diagram of the form

$$
  \array{
    \vdots
    \\
    \downarrow & \nwarrow
    \\
    \pi_\bullet(F_2) &\stackrel{\pi_\bullet(f_2)}{\longrightarrow}& \pi_\bullet(K_2)
    \\
    \downarrow & \nwarrow^{\mathrlap{\pi_\bullet(\partial_2)}}
    \\
    \pi_\bullet(F_1) &\stackrel{\pi_\bullet(f_1)}{\longrightarrow}& \pi_\bullet(K_1)
    \\
    \downarrow & \nwarrow^{\mathrlap{\pi_\bullet(\partial_1)}}
    \\
    \pi_\bullet(X) &\stackrel{\pi_\bullet(f_0)}{\longrightarrow}& \pi_\bullet(K_0)
  }
  \,,
$$

where the diagonal maps are the images of the [[connecting homomorphisms]] and hence decrease degree in $\pi_\bullet$ by one. This is an (unrolled) [[exact couple]]. The corresponding [[spectral sequence]] is the [[Adams spectral sequence]] induced by the given Adams resolution.

In the case of $E = H \mathbb{F}_p$, applying [[cohomology]] $H^\bullet(-, \mathbb{F}_p)$ to the original diagram
yields  a [[free resolution]] of the [[cohomology ring]] $H^\bullet(X,\mathbb{Z}_p)$ by a [[chain complex]] of [[free modules]] over the [[Steenrod algebra]] $A_p$. 

$$
  \array{
    H^\bullet(K_0) &\leftarrow& H^\bullet(\Sigma K_1) &\leftarrow& H^\bullet(\Sigma^2 K_2)  &\leftarrow& \cdots
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    H^\bullet(X)
    &\leftarrow& 0
    &\leftarrow& 0    
   &\leftarrow&  \cdots  
  }
$$

The computaton of the [[cohomology]] of $X$ by means of this resolution is given by the [[Adams spectral sequence]].

### Via injective resoltions
 {#ViaInjectiveResolutions}

A streamlined discussion of $E$-Adams resolutions in close analogy to [[injective resolutions]] in [[homological algebra]] was given in ([Miller 81](#Miller81)), advertized in ([Hopkins 99](#Hopkins99)) and worked out in more detail in ([Aramian](#Aramian)).
