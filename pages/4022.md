## Idea

Borel sets are certain [[subsets]] of a [[topological space]].  They form the Borel $\sigma$-algebra of the space, and they play an important role in [[measure theory]]; see [[measurable space]].

## Definition

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]].  Then there is a $\sigma$-[[sigma-algebra|algebra]] $\mathcal{B}$ on $X$ generated by the [[open subsets]] of $X$. Elements of $\mathcal{B}$ are called the __Borel sets__ of $X$, and $\mathcal{B}$ itself is called the __Borel $\sigma$-algebra__ on $X$.
