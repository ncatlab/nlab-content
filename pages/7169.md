## Idea

For $X$ a [[space]] of [[dimension]] $2k$ and $H^k(X)$ a [[cohomology group]] on a space $X$ equipped with [[orientation in generalized cohomology|H-orientation]] in degree $k$ with coefficients in some $A$, the **intersection pairing** on [[cohomology]] is the map

$$
  H^k(X) \times H^k(X) \to A
$$

given by [[fiber integration]]

$$
  (\lambda, \omega) \mapsto \int_X (\lambda \cup \omega)
  \,,
$$

of the [[cup product]]

$$
  \cup : H^k(X) \times H^k(X) \to H^{2k}(X)
  \,.
$$



## Examples

### In integral cohomology

The [[signature of a quadratic form]] of the [[quadratic form]] induced by the intersection pairing in [[integral cohomology]] is the _[[signature genus]]_.

### In $\mathbb{Z}_2$-cohomology

Over a [[Riemann surface]] $X$, the intersection pairing on $H^1(X, \mathbb{Z}_2)$ has a [[quadratic refinement]] by the function that sends a [[Theta characteristic]] to the mod 2-dimension of its space of sections. See _[Theta characteristic -- Over Riemann surfaces](Theta+characteristic#OverRiemannSurfaces)_.

### In ordinary differential cohomology: higher abelian Chern-Simons theory
 {#SecondaryIntersectionPairing}

For the case that the cohomology in question is [[ordinary differential cohomology]], 

* a [[cocycle]] in degree $k$ is a [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle (k-1)-bundle with connection]], 

* the cup product is the [[Beilinson-Deligne cup product]];

* and the required notion of orientation is now _[[orientation in differential cohomology]]_: a [[differential Thom class]].  

The differentially refined intersection pairing is non-trivial and interesting also on manifolds of dimension less than $2k$, where the integral intersection pairing vanishes: it provides a _[[secondary characteristic class]]_, a **secondary intersection pairing**.

Notably, the [[diagonal]] of the intersection pairing in in dimension $2k-1$ is the [[action functional]] of quadratic abelian [[higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory]].

Its [[quadratic refinement]] is discussed in 
([Hopkins-Singer](#HopkinsSinger)).
