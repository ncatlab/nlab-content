## Idea

For $X$ a [[space]] of [[dimension]] $2k$ and $H^k(X)$ a [[cohomology group]] on a space $X$ equipped with [[orientation in generalized cohomology|H-orientation]] in degree $k$ with coefficients in some $A$, the **intersection pairing** on [[cohomology]] is the map

$$
  H^k(X) \times H^k(X) \to A
$$

given by [[fiber integration]]

$$
  (\lambda, \omega) \mapsto \int_X (\lambda \cup \omega)
  \,,
$$

of the [[cup product]]

$$
  \cup : H^k(X) \times H^k(X) \to H^{2k}(X)
  \,.
$$

## Examples

### Higher dimensional Chern-Simons theories

For the case that the cohomology in question is [[ordinary differential cohomology]], the [[diagonal]] of the intersection pairing is the [[action functional]] of abelian [[higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory]].
