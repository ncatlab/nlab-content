## Idea

In formal [[logic]] a _sequent_ is an expression in the metalanguage 
which is a string of symbols of the form

$$
  Ctxt \vdash Jdgmt
$$

where 

1. $Ctxt$ are symbols indicating a logical [[context]], 

1. $Jdgmt$ are symbols indicating a [[judgement]] 

1. the **turnstile**-symbol "$\vdash$" is supposed to be a formal reflection of a statement like

   " $Ctxt$ yields $Jdgmt$."

   or

   "In $Ctxt$ the $Jdgmt$ can be proven."

   or

   "$Ctxt$, con-sequent-ly $Jdgmt$."

   Or similar. 


There are several systems of formal logic with several specific implementations of this idea. See for instance 

* [[sequent calculus]]

* [[dependent type theory]]

(...)

## Semantics

### In homotopy type theory

Under the [[categorical semantics]] of [[homotopy type theory]]
sequents in the type theory pretty accurately corrsepond to 
[[morphisms]] in the [[(∞,1)-topos]]. We indicate how this works, first for type declarations, then for terms of [[dependent types]].

Let $\mathbf{H}$ be an [[(∞,1)-topos]]. Write $Type \in \mathbf{H}$ for the [[universe in a topos|internal universe]] of  [[small objects]] of $\mathbf{H}$, called the _[[object classifier]]_. 

This is defined as the [[representable functor|representing object]]
for the [[core]] of the [[small object|small]] [[codomain fibration]], exhibited by an  [[equivalence of ∞-groupoids]]

$$
  name
  :
  Core(\mathbf{H}_{/X})^{small} \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} \mathbf{H}(X,Type)
  \,.
$$

This equivalence sends an $X$-family $(E \to X) \in \mathbf{H}_{/X}$ to its "name", denoted

$$
  X \stackrel{\vdash E}{\to} Type
  \,,
$$

which is the morphism characterized by fitting into an
[[(∞,1)-pullback|∞-pullback]] square of the form

$$
  \array{
     E &\to& \widehat{Type}
     \\
     \downarrow &\swArrow& \downarrow
     \\
     X &\underset{\vdash E}{\to}& Type
  }
  \,,
$$

If here we simply replace, notationally, the arrow "$\to$" by the turnstile "$\vdash$", display a generic [[generalized element]] $x$ of $X$ and then write $E(x)$ to highlight the dependence of the [[fibers]] of $E$ on $x$ in $X$, then the symbols "$X \stackrel{\vdash E}{\to} Type$" become the 
sequent "$x : X \vdash E(x) : Type$".
This sequent is the [[syntax]] of which the morphism is the [[categorical semantics]]. 

Similarly, if $X \stackrel{t}{\to}_X E$
is a [[section]] of $E$ over $X$, hence 
a [[generalized element]] in the [[slice (∞,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}_{/X}$,
then by replacing the arrow-symbol by a
 turnstile-symbol we get "$x : X \vdash t(x) : E(x)$".
This is the sequent for the [[term]] $t$ of the [[dependent type]] $E$.

In summary we have under the [[relation between category theory and type theory]] the notational correspondence:

**morphisms to sequents.**

| $\,$ | [[types]] | [[terms]] |
|--|--|--|
| [[(∞,1)-topos theory|∞-topos theory]] | $\;\;\;\;X \stackrel{\vdash \;\;\;\;E}{\to} \;\;\Type$ | $\;\;\;\;X \stackrel{\vdash \;\;\;t}{\to} {}_X \;\;E$ |
|[[homotopy type theory]] | $x : X \vdash E(x) : Type$ | $x : X \vdash t(x) : E(x) $ |
