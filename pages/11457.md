## Definition

Over the [[complex numbers]], a _framed elliptic curve_ is an [[elliptic curve]] equipped with an [[order|ordered]] [[basis]] $\{a,b\}$ of the [[homology]] of the curve such that the [[intersection number]] $a\cdot b$ is 1 (e.g. [Hain 08, def. 1.13](#Hain08)).

The standard construction of the [[moduli stack of elliptic curves]] is in fact via the [[orbifold quotient]] of the space of framed elliptic curves [[action|acted]] on by the [[modular group]].

A framing on an elliptic curve is in a way the extreme case of a _[[level structure on an elliptic curve]]_.
