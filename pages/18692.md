A **tangent bundle category** is a [[category]] equipped with a "[[tangent bundle]]" [[endofunctor]] satisfying some natural axioms.

Usually these are called simply **tangent categories**, but on the nLab the page [[tangent category]] is about "the tangent category of a given category" constructed by abelianization.  In other words, tangent bundle categories are about *abstraction* of the tangent bundle construction, while tangent categories are a *categorification* thereof (in some vague sense).

The definition is due to
