This is a sub-entry of [[geometric models for elliptic cohomology]] and [[A Survey of Elliptic Cohomology]] 

See there for background and context.

This entry here is about the definition of $(2|1)$-dimensional [[super-cobordism]] categories and $(2|1)$-dimensional [[FQFT]]s given by functors on these.

=--

Let [[SDiff]] be the [[category]] of [[supermanifold]]s.

We will define a [[stack]]/[[fibered category]] on $SDiff$ called $E Bord_{2|1}$ whose morphisms are smooth families of (2|1)-dimensional [[super-cobordism]]s, and a [[stack]]/[[fibered category]] $sTV^{fam}$ of topological super vector bundles.

So recall

* [[supergeometry - contents|supergeometry]].

**question**: What is the right notion of Riemannian or Euclidean structure on [[super-cobordism]]s?

**strategy**: From the [[path integral]] perspective we need some structure on $\Sigma$ such that the "space" of maps $Maps(\Sigma,X)$ naturally carries some measure that allows to perform a [[path integral]].

This perspective suggests certain genralizations of the notion of [[Riemannian manifold]] to [[supermanifold]]s which may be a little different than what one might have thought of naively.

We want to define [[Euclidean supermanifold]]s as a genralization of [[Riemannian manifold]] with _flat_ Riemannian metric.

notice that there is a canonical bijection between

* flat [[Riemannian metric]]s on a $d$-dimensional [[manifold]] $X$

* a maximal [[atlas]] on $X$ consisting of charts such that all transition functions belong the the **Euclidean group** or **Galileo group** 

  $$
    Eucl(\mathbb{R}^d)
    :=
    \mathbb{R}^d \rtimes O(\mathbb{R}^d)
  $$

  (rigid translations and rotations)

In analogy to that we define:

Similarly a **Euclidean structure** on a $(d|\delta)$-dimensional [[supermanifold]] is defined using the Euclidean [[super Lie group]] given by the [[semidirect product]]

$$
  Eucl(\mathbb{R}^{d|\delta})
  :=
  \mathbb{R}^{d|\delta}
  \rtimes
  Spin(\mathbb{R}^d)
$$

where the [[Spin]] group acts on the translations in $\mathbb{R}^{d|\delta}$ in a way to be specified.


first recall the notion of

* [[complex supermanifold]]

**goal** replace the standard Euclidean group $(\mathbb{R}^d, Eucl(\mathbb{R}^d))$ by the [[super Euclidean group]]
$(X,G)$ where $X$ is a suitable [[supermanifold]]
and $G$ a suitable [[super Lie group]].

This leads to the notion of

* [[Euclidean supermanifold]].

The morphisms of the category $E Bord_{(2|1)}$ will be [[cobordism]]s that are [[Euclidean supermanifold]]s.

**goal** define the [[fibered category]]

$$
  \array{
    E Bord_{d|\delta}^{sfam}
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    cSDiff
  }
$$

where $cSDiff$ is the category of [[complex supermanifold]]s.

The objects of this fibered category are

$$
  \array{
    Y^{\pm} &\to& Y &\leftarrow& Y^c
    \\
    & \searrow & \downarrow & \swarrow
    \\
    && S
  }
$$

where $Y \to S$ is a family of [[Euclidean supermanifold]]s of dimension $(d|\delta)$.

For the non-super, non-family version of **Euclidean bordism** we require that the core $Y^c$ is totally geodesic in $Y$.

now for the superversion we require that there exist charts (in the open atlas) of $Y \to S$ covering all of $Y^c$ such that

$$
  \array{
    && S
    \\
    & \nearrow && \nwarrow
    \\
    Y \supset_{open} U &&\stackrel{\phi}{\to}&&
    V \subset S \times \mathbb{R}^{d|\delta}_{cs}
    \\
    \downarrow^{\supset} &&&& \downarrow^{\supset}
    \\
    Y^c \supset U \cap Y^c
    &&\stackrel{\simeq}{\to}&&
    V \cap S \times \mathbb{R}^{d-1|\delta}
    \subset S \times \mathbb{R}^{d-1|\delta}_{cs}
  }
$$

next, a **Euclidean superbordism** from $Y_0 \to S$ to $Y_1 \to S$ is a diagram

$$
  \array{
    Y_1 
     &\stackrel{i_1}{\to}& 
    \Sigma 
     &\stackrel{i_0}{\leftarrow}& Y_1
    \\
     & \searrow & \downarrow & \swarrow
    \\
    && S
  }
$$

where $i_0, i_1$ are morphisms (of families of $(X,G)$-spaces) satisfying the (+)-condition and the (c)-condition described at [[bordism categories following Stolz-Teichner]].

Now a morphism in $E Bord^{sfam}_{d|\delta}$ from $Y_0 \to S_0$ to $Y_1 \to S_1$ is a bordism fitting into a diagram

$$
  \array{
      \Sigma &\stackrel{i_1}{\leftarrow}&
      f^* Y_1 &\to& Y_1
     \\
     \uparrow^{i_0} &\searrow& \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     Y_1 &\to & S_0 &\stackrel{f}{\to}& S1
  }
$$

and we identify bordisms $\Sigma, \Sigma'$ if they are isometric -- namely isomorphic in the category of [[Euclidean supermanifold]]s --  "rel boundary".

**definition** A **$(d|\delta)$-dimensional Euclidean field theory** is a [[symmetric monoidal functor]]

$$
  E \in Fun_{csDiff}^\otimes(E Bord_{(d|\delta)}^{sfam},
  TV^{sfam})
$$

of [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal]] [[fibered category|fibered cateories]] (i. [[symmetric monoidal functor]] as well as [[cartesian functor]] ) over the category $cSDiff$ of [[complex supermanifold]]s.

**Definition** (roughly) $TV^{sfam}$ is the category of families of topological vector spaces parameterized by [[complex supermanifold]]s.

Recall that the ordinary category $TV$ is the catgeory of complete [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]], locally convex [[topological vector space]].

define the [[projective tensor product]] of two such $V, W \in TV$. This is a certain completion of the algebraic tensor product $V \otimes_{alg} W$ with respect to the projective topology on $V \otimes_{alg} W$.

This will be the coarsest [[topology]] (the one with the least open sets) making the following maps $f'$

$$
  \array{
     V \otimes_{alg} W &\to& Z
     \\
     & \nearrow_{f'}
     \\
     V \times W
   }
$$

continuous. 

**Remark**

$$
  \array{
    C^\infty(M \times N)
    &\leftarrow&
    C^\infty(M) \otimes_{alg} C^\infty(N)
    \\
    & {}_{\simeq}\nwarrow & \downarrow^{\subset}
    \\
    && C^\infty(M) \otimes C^\infty(N)
  }
$$

**Definition** the objects of $TV^{sfam}$ are pairs $(S,V)$ for $S$ a [[supermanifold]] and $V$ is a [[sheaf]] of locally complex $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded [[topological vector space]] with the structure of a sheaf of modules of the [[structure sheaf]] $O_S$.

**goal** define the [[partition function]] of of a $(2|1)$-dimensional Euclidean field theory.

**definition** Let $E$ be an EFT as above.

We may think of $\mathbb{R}_+ \times h$ (positive axis times upper half plane) as moduli space of Euclidean tori, where for $(\ell, \tau) \in \mathbb{R}_+ \times h$ we get a torus (regarded as a [[cobordism]]) denoted $T_{\ell,\tau}$. This is the torus given by the lattice spanned by $(1,0)$ and $\ell Re(\tau) + Im(\tau)$ in the upper half plane. Then for the ordinary EFT we would define

$$
  Z_E : \mathbb{R}_+ \times h \to \mathbb {C}
$$

  


$$
  (\ell,\tau) \mapsto E(T_{\ell,\tau})
$$

For the superversion we put

$$
  Z_{E} := Z_{E_{red}}
$$

where

$$
  \array{
    && E Bord_{2|1}^{sfam}
    \\
    & {}^{\rho}\nearrow
    &&
    \searrow^{E}
    \\
    E Bord_{2, Spin}^{fam}
    &\stackrel{E_{red}}{\to}&
    TV^{fam}
    &
     \hookrightarrow
    &
    TV^{sfam}
  }
$$
