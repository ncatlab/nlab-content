A functor $A^{op}\to Set$ is __prorepresentable__ (or __pro-representable__) if it is a small [[filtered limit]] of representables. In other words, it corresponds to a [[pro-object]].

However there are some standard situations and conventions when this terminology is used. One says pro-object in $C$, and may use various descriptions some of which are not via functors but via the (system of) representing objects in $C$, but one does not say prorepresentable functor in $C$ (but in the functor/presheaf category, or "on $A^{op}$").
