##Idea

The term 'shuffle' conjures up the idea of shuffling a pack of cards. In fact the mathematical idea is nearer to shuffling two packs of cards one through the other. Suppose we have a pack of $p$ cards and a pack of $q$ cards and we build a pack of $p+q$ cards, whilst retaining the order on the two 'sub-packs'.  The result is a $(p,q)$-shuffle. 

##Shuffles : Definition

###### Definition

For $p,q \in \mathbb{N}$ two [[natural number]]s, a **$(p,q)$-shuffle** is a [[permutation]]

$$
  (\mu_1, \cdots, \mu_p, \nu_1, \cdots, \nu_q)
$$

of $(1,2, \cdots, p+q)$ subject to the condition that

$$  
  \mu_1 \lt \mu_2 \lt \cdots \lt \mu_p
$$

and

$$  
  \nu_1 \lt \nu_2 \lt \cdots \lt \nu_q
  \,.
$$

The **signature** of a $(p,q)$-shuffle is the [[signature of a permutation|signature]] of the corresponding permutation.

##Unshuffles
The same basic situation viewed from the other end leads to *unshuffles**.  In these instead of combining things, we take the permutation and decompose it.

###### Definition
We say that a permutation $\sigma\in S_n$ is a $(j,n-j)$-unshuffle, $o\leq j\leq n$ if $\sigma(1)\lt \ldots \sigma(j)$ and $\sigma(j+1)\lt \ldots \lt \sigma(n)$.

You can also say that $\sigma$ is a $(j,n-j)$-unshuffle if $\sigma(i) \lt \sigma(i+1)$ when $i\neq j$.


## Applications 

### Products of simplices

Shuffles control the combinatorics of [[product]]s of [[simplices]]. See [[products of simplices]] for details.

### Eilenberg-Zilber map

Related to the product of simplices: shuffles control the [[Eilenberg-Zilber map]]. See there for details.

###Differential graded coalgebras

Shuffles are used in defining the pre-cgc structure on $\bigwedge V$ in the theory of [[differential graded coalgebras]]

###Differential graded Hopf algebras
Shuffles are also used for defining the shuffle product on $T(V)$, see [[differential graded Hopf algebra]].

###[[L-infinity algebras]] and [[A-infinity algebras]]

In the definitions of these structures the _unshuffle_ side of shuffles is used.
