A sifted colimit is a colimit of a category D where the diagonal functor $\Delta : D \rightarrow D \times D$ is [[final|final functor]]. Such limits commute with finite products in Set.

A motivating example is a [[reflexive coequalizer]]. In fact, sifted colimits can "almost" be characterized as combinations of filtered colimits and reflexive coequalizers.
