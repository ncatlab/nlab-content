## Idea

The _Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem_ describes  (the failure of) the [[natural transformation|naturality]] of the behaviour of a _[[Chern character]]_ under [[fiber integration|push forward]] along [[proper maps]].

It says that the Chern-character of the push-forward of some $E$ is the push-forward of the [[cup product]] of the Chern-character of $E$ with a certain correction class.
