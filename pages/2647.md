A __tensor category__ is a [[category]] equipped with an operation similar to the [[tensor product]] in [[Ab]].

We tend not to use this term, since it means different things to different people.  It may mean:
*  any [[monoidal category]],
*  specifically a [[symmetric monoidal category]] (and then a __quasitensor category__ is a [[braided monoidal category]]),
*  an [[additive category|additive]] (symmetric) monoidal category,
*  an [[Ab-enriched category|Ab-enriched]] or [[Vect]]-enriched (symmetric) monoidal category.
