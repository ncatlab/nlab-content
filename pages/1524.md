In [[constructive mathematics]], Markov\'s principle is the (classically trivial) statement that any infinite [[sequence]] of $0$ and $1$ that is not all $1$s must have a $0$ somewhere.  Stated in a more [[logic]]al form, if $P$ is a predicate on [[natural number]]s, then
$$ (\forall n, P(n) \vee \neg{P(n)}) \Rightarrow \neg(\forall n, P(n)) \Rightarrow \exists n, \neg{P(n)} .$$
Compare this to
$$ \neg(\exists n, P(n)) \Rightarrow \forall n, \neg{P(n)} ,$$
which is a theorem of [[intuitionistic logic]].
More generally, a [[set]] $S$ may be called _Markovian_ if this principle holds for all predicates on $S$.

In standard constructive mathematics (such as in the [[internal logic]] of a [[topos]]), it is possible that the only Markovian sets are the Kuratowski-[[finite set]]s.  Thus, Markov\'s principle, stating that the set of natural numbers is Markovian, is nontrivial.  (It is true, of course, in a [[Boolean topos]]; that is, it follows from the principle of [[excluded middle]].)

[[А. А. Марков Jr]] (the one who proved undecidability theorems, and son of the great stochastician) belonged to the [[Russian constructivism|Russian school of constructivism]], which saw mathematics as about computability.  From this perpsective, Markov\'s principle is justified as follows:  We are justified in concluding $\exists n, \neg{P(n)}$ if we can actually compute a value of $n$ such that $P(n)$ can be proved; since $P$ is decidable, it\'s enough to compute $n$ such that $P(n)$ is true.  And to compute this, you just set a computer working, deciding $P(0), P(1), P(2), \ldots$, until it finds $n$.  Other constructivists find this argument unconvincing, since they\'re not convinced that the computer will ever stop, even though it\'s impossible that it continue forever.

Equivalent forms:
*  If a [[Turing machine]] does not run forever, then it halts.
*  If an [[extended natural number system|extended natural number]] is not infinite, then it is finite.
*  If a [[Cauchy real number]] does not equal zero, then it is [[apartness relation|apart]] from zero in that it has a multiplicative inverse.

Note that the contrapositives of these are all valid regardless of Markov\'s principle.
