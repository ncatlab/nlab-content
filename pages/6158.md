* [[Ralph Cohen]], [[Veronique Godin]], _A polarized view of string topology_, in [[Graeme Segal]], [[Ulrike Tillmann]] (eds.) _Topology, Geometry and Quantum Field Theory_, LMS, Lecture Notes Series 308
  ([arXiv:math/0303003](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0303003))

on realization of closed-[[string topology]] operations as an [[HQFT]].

See also the followup
