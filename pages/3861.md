Encyclopaedia of Mathematics is an enhanced English translation of the Soviet version in Russian (5 volumes), which was a collective effort.  Most of the entries had originally a single author, who signed it as an article; most articles had a very useful bibliography. The English edition was enhanced with editorial additions to the original passages (paragraphs cleanly separated from the original entries), as well as new articles.
