#Idea#

Suppose we inscribe a regular pentagon, a regular decagon, and a regular hexagon in circles of the same radius.  If we denote the respective edge lengths of these polygons by $P$, $D$ and $H$, then these lengths will satisfy the identity:

$$P^2=D^2+H^2$$

This means that the edges of a pentagon, decagon and hexagon of identical radii can fit together to form a right triangle.

#Euclid's proof#

Euclid gave a proof of this identity in his _Elements_, as [Proposition 10](http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookXIII/propXIII10.html) of Book XIII.  The essence of this proof can be understood if we take for granted the numerical values of the various angles in his construction, which are easily established.

[[!include pentagon decagon hexagon identity/Euclid]]

The line segment $A B$ is one edge of a pentagon inscribed in a circle centred at $F$, and $A K$ and $K B$ are edges of a decagon inscribed in the same circle.  Note that while $A B$ is bisected by $H$ and $A K$ is bisected by $L$, the point $N$ is _not_ a point of bisection of $A H$.

Triangle $A B F$ is similar to triangle $B F N$.  So $\frac{A B}{B F}=\frac{B F}{F N}=\frac{B F}{B N}$, with the last equality true because the triangles are isosceles with $F N = B N$.  Thus ${B F}^2={A B}\cdot{B N}$.

Triangle $B A K$ is similar to triangle $K A N$.  So $\frac{B A}{A K}=\frac{K A}{A N}$.  Thus ${A K}^2={A B}\cdot{A N}$.

Adding our two results, we have:
${B F}^2+{A K}^2={A B}\cdot(A N + B N)={A B}^2$.

$B F$ is our radius (or equivalently, the length of one side of a hexagon inscribed in the same circle), $A K$ is a decagon side, and $A B$ is a pentagon side.  So we have established the pentagon-decagon-hexagon identity.

#Other proofs#

We present two other proofs of the identity.  Both of these rely on a lemma concerning the ratio of sides in a "golden triangle".

##Golden triangle lemma##

[[!include pentagon decagon hexagon identity/golden triangle]]

The lemma states that in any isosceles triangle with angles of 72&deg;, 36&deg; and 72&deg;, the ratio of the long sides of the triangle to its base is $\Phi$, the golden ratio, which is defined as the unique positive solution of the equation:

$$1+\frac{1}{\Phi}=\Phi$$

Note that some authors call "the golden ratio" the reciprocal of the number we're calling $\Phi$.  For the purpose of this article, $\Phi=\frac{\sqrt{5}+1}{2}\approx 1.61803$.

In the diagram above, triangle $B D E$ is similar to triangle $B E C$.  So:

$$\frac{B D}{B E}=\frac{B E}{B C}$$
$$\frac{r+t}{r}=\frac{r}{t}$$
$$1+\frac{t}{r}=\frac{r}{t}$$

By the definition of the golden ratio, $\frac{r}{t}=\Phi$.

This lemma was given by Euclid as [Proposition 9](http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookXIII/propXIII9.html) of Book XIII.

##Proof from an identity for the golden ratio##

[[!include pentagon decagon hexagon identity/golden ratio]]

By the golden triangle lemma for isosceles triangles with angles of 36&deg;, triangle $N O P$ gives us $r=t\Phi$.  From the same lemma, applied to triangle $N M P$ glued to its mirror image in the line $N M$, we have $2b=t/\Phi$.

From the right triangle $N M P$ we have $s^2=t^2-b^2$, hence $(2s)^2=4t^2-4b^2$.

The whole large multi-coloured rectangle has an area of $(2s)^2$, because the green square, the light blue rectangle, and each of the two red rectangles _all_ have areas of $t^2$, but then we need to subtract the light red
square where the two red rectangles overlap, and that has area $4b^2$.

Now if we subtract a single $t^2$, the light blue rectangle, then we're left with a square of side length $r$,
thanks to the fact that $\Phi=1+1/\Phi$.  So $(2s)^2-t^2=r^2$, which is the pentagon-decagon-hexagon identity.

The middle section of this proof is, essentially, a geometric proof of the identity:

$$\Phi^2+\frac{1}{\Phi^2}=3$$

which can also be verified algebraically from the defining equation for $\Phi$.  We can see this identity a bit more clearly if we remove the leftmost rectangle from the construction, slide the rightmost one down to eliminate the overlap, and take out the overall factor of $t$ from all the sides.  We then have:

[[!include pentagon decagon hexagon identity/golden ratio identity]]

##Proof from a construction on the icosahedron##

Suppose we take **three congruent rectangles**, and assemble them symmetrically so that their _long_ edges are all mutually orthogonal, and their _short_ edges are all mutually orthogonal.  Like this:

[[!include pentagon decagon hexagon identity/skinny duads]]

We then join up the corners to make an icosahedron, as in the diagram above.  Eight faces of this icosahedron (the ones centred on the diagonals of the eight "octants" into which the space here is divided) will _always_ be congruent and equilateral; that's guaranteed by the construction, whatever the precise ratio of the side lengths of the rectangles.  The other twelve faces will be isosceles triangles, all congruent to each other.

Now, it's clear that by making the rectangles long and skinny, we can make the isosceles triangles as long and skinny as we like.  But what about making them short and squat?  How far can we go in that direction?

[[!include pentagon decagon hexagon identity/square duads]]

If we make the three rectangles into squares, as above, the isosceles triangles have two 45&deg; angles.  So between this extreme, and the long-and-skinny extreme, it's clear that we can choose _some_ intermediate degree of skinniness for the rectangles that will turn the 12 isosceles triangles into equilateral triangles.

(This argument implicity uses the [[intermediate value theorem]] and would not have been used by Euclid, although Archimedes might have attempted it.  An alternative that avoids using the intermediate value theorem is given at the end of the proof.)

So, a _regular_ icosahedron _must_ exist, and it will have six edges that form three mutually orthogonal pairs.

[[!include pentagon decagon hexagon identity/duads]]

Having reached that conclusion, we now use the construction below, where we assume our icosahedron is regular and we project everything into the plane of one of our rectangles.

[[!include pentagon decagon hexagon identity/icosahedron]]

Where two vertices are projected to the same point in the diagram, a circle is drawn around the point.

We can't _yet_ justify the specific value, $\Phi$, that we've written here as the length of the rectangles ... but we don't need to!
Without any calculations that depend on $\Phi$, we can see that $Q R$ is parallel to $A B$, and that both are orthogonal to $O P$.  That's enough to show that the triangle $A B C$ is congruent to the triangle $S P T$.

Now, the five vertices of the icosahedron that project onto the line segment $A P R$ will form a regular pentagon, the edges of which are also edges of the icosahedron.  The five vertices that project onto the line segment $(-A) S Q$ will form another pentagon.  These two pentagons will be congruent, and the radius of the circle in which they're inscribed will be $A C$.  And since the triangle $A B C$ is congruent to the triangle $S P T$, the _distance_ between the pentagons, $S T$, equals their radius, $A C$.

These two pentagons are shown in the diagram below.

[[!include pentagon decagon hexagon identity/icosahedron triangles]]

If we draw a line perpendicular to the planes of the two pentagons, from a vertex in one plane to the point below it on the other plane, the length of that perpendicular will be the common radius of the pentagons, $A C$.  But that line will form a right triangle whose hypotenuse is an icosahedral edge (congruent to the edges of the pentagons), and whose third (shortest) side is one edge of a decagon inscribed in the same circle as the lower pentagon.  The decagon edge arises because the two pentagons are rotated relative to each other by an angle of 36&deg;, the angle between vertices in a decagon.

So, the two blue triangles in the diagram are congruent (both being right triangles with a pentagon edge as their hypotenuse and the radius as one of their sides), and both exhibit the pentagon-decagon-hexagon identity.

Finally, we can appeal to Euclid's golden triangle lemma -- which gives us the ratio between the radius and the decagon edge length as $\Phi$ -- and work backwards to show that this is also the ratio of length to width for our three orthogonal rectangles.  This follows simply from the fact that the right triangle $O R P$ is similar to the right triangle $C A B$.

Suppose we wish to avoid using the intermediate value theorem.  If we project the generic version of our icosahedron onto the plane of one of its rectangles, we get this:

[[!include pentagon decagon hexagon identity/irregular icosahedron]]

In order to make $A P R$ into a straight line -- which amounts to making the pentagon of vertices that project onto $A P R$ into a planar figure -- we need to satisfy:

$$\frac{x+1}{x}=x$$

This is just the defining equation for the golden ratio, $\Phi$.  If our icosahedron is regular, the pentagonal pyramid that sits on the pentagon will be made up of equilateral triangles, and its base will be planar.  So we can only get a regular icosahedron if we set $x=\Phi$.

Of course if we're sceptical about the very _existence_ of a regular icosahedron, we need to do a bit more work and confirm that this choice of $x$ actually makes the variable edge length in our generic icosahedron equal to the other edge length that's fixed by the short side of the rectangles (and which we've set at 1).  The squared length is:

$$\frac{\Phi^2+(\Phi-1)^2+1}{4}=\frac{\Phi^2+\frac{1}{\Phi^2}+1}{4}=\frac{3+1}{4}=1$$

Here the first step comes directly from the defining equation for $\Phi$, and the second uses the identity we proved earlier, $\Phi^2+\frac{1}{\Phi^2}=3$.
