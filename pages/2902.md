#Idea#

Suppose we inscribe a regular pentagon, a regular decagon, and a regular hexagon in circles of the same radius.  If we denote the respective edge lengths of these polygons by $P$, $D$ and $H$, then these lengths will satisfy the identity:

$$P^2=D^2+H^2$$

This means that the edges of a pentagon, decagon and hexagon of identical radii can fit together to form a right triangle.

#Euclid's proof#

Euclid gave a proof of this identity in his <i>Elements</i>, as Proposition 10 of Book XIII.  The essence of this proof can be understood if we take for granted the numerical values of the various angles in his construction, which are easily established.

Triangle $A B F$ is similar to triangle $B F N$.  So $\frac{A B}{B F}=\frac{B F}{F N}=\frac{B F}{B N}$, with the last equality true because the triangles are isosceles with $F N = B N$.  Thus ${B F}^2={A B}\cdot{B N}$.

Triangle $B A K$ is similar to triangle $K A N$.  So $\frac{B A}{A K}=\frac{K A}{A N}$.  Thus ${A K}^2={A B}\cdot{A N}$.

Adding our two results, we have:
${B F}^2+{A K}^2={A B}\cdot(A N + B N)={A B}^2$.

$B F$ is our radius (or equivalently, the length of one side of a hexagon inscribed in the same circle), $A K$ is a decagon side, and $A B$ is a pentagon side.

#Other proofs#

We present two other proofs of the identity.  Both of these rely on a lemma concerning the ratio of sides in a "golden triangle".

##Golden triangle lemma##

[[!include pentagon decagon hexagon identity/golden triangle]]

The lemma states that in any isosceles triangle with angles of 72&deg;, 36&deg; and 72&deg;, the ratio of the long sides of the triangle to its base is $\Phi$, the golden ratio, which is defined as the unique positive solution of the equation:

$$1+\frac{1}{\Phi}=\Phi$$

In the diagram above, triangle $B D E$ is similar to triangle $B E C$.  So:

$$\frac{B D}{B E}=\frac{B E}{B C}$$
$$\frac{r+t}{r}=\frac{r}{t}$$
$$1+\frac{t}{r}=\frac{r}{t}$$

By the definition of the golden ratio, $\frac{r}{t}=\Phi$.

This lemma was given by Euclid as Proposition 9 of Book XIII of the <i>Elements</i>.

##Proof from an identity for the golden ratio##

[[!include pentagon decagon hexagon identity/golden ratio]]

By the golden triangle lemma for isosceles triangles with angles of 36&deg;, triangle $N O P$ gives us $r=t\Phi$.  From the same rule for triangle $N M P$ glued to its mirror image in the line $N M$ we have $2b=t/\Phi$.

From the right triangle $N M P$ we have $s^2=t^2-b^2$, hence $(2s)^2=4t^2-4b^2$.

The whole large multi-coloured rectangle has an area of $(2s)^2$, because the green square, the light blue rectangle, and each of the two red rectangles <i>all</i> have areas of $t^2$, but then we need to subtract the light red
square where the two red rectangles overlap, and that has area $4b^2$.

Now if we subtract a single $t^2$, the light blue rectangle, then we're left with a square of side length $r$,
thanks to the fact that $\Phi=1+1/\Phi$.  So $(2s)^2-t^2=r^2$, which is the pentagon-decagon-hexagon identity.

##Proof from a construction on the icosahedron##

[[!include pentagon decagon hexagon identity/icosahedron]]

Suppose we construct an icosahedron based on three orthogonal "duads".  These are rectangles in the golden ratio, with vertices of the icosahedron at their corners.  In the diagram above, everything is projected into the plane of one duad,
which has the vertices $A$, $B$, $-A$ and $-B$ as its corners.  Where two vertices are projected to the same point in the diagram, there is a circle drawn around the point.

By construction, all vertices will be equidistant from the centre of symmetry, and it's not too hard to prove that all the edge lengths are equal.  (The edge lengths have been normalised to 1.)  So it's not difficult to see that we really do have an icosahedron here.

The right triangle $O R P$ is similar to the right triangle $C A B$.  So $\frac{O R}{O P}=\Phi=\frac{C A}{C B}$.  So by the golden triangle lemma, $C B$ is the edge length of a decagon inscribed in a circle of radius $C A$.

But the five vertices that project onto the line $A P R$ form a regular pentagon inscribed in a circle of radius $C A$, and the edge length of that pentagon is $A B$.  So the right triangle $C A B$ constitutes a proof of the pentagon-decagon-hexagon identity.
