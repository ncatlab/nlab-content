This page will eventually host some useful information for those seeking guidance on what a contribution to the nLab means. We hope to provide answers to questions such as:

1. Who owns the content of the nLab?
2. Can I publish material that I contribute to the nLab?
3. How should I refer to the nLab in a bibliographic reference?
4. How can I justify to my sponsors spending time contributing content to the nLab?

Please add any additional questions here or join the discussion on the <a href="http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Vanilla/nForum/comments.php?DiscussionID=36">n-Forum</a>.

Note on (2):  Since you (the contributor) have not agreed otherwise, there is no question that you have the legal right to publish material that you contribute to the Lab.  The question is how to accept edits by others.
