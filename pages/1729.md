This page will eventually host some useful information for those seeking guidance on what a contribution to the nLab means. We hope to provide answers to questions such as:

* Who owns the content of the nLab?
* Can I publish material that I contribute to the nLab?
* How should I refer to the nLab in a bibliographic reference?
* How can I justify to my sponsors spending time contributing content to the nLab?

Please add any additional questions here or join the discussion on the <a href="http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Vanilla/nForum/comments.php?DiscussionID=36">n-Forum</a>.
