So far, mathematical analysis has not been much in focus of $n$lab; this could be compensated partly by noting that web (including wikipedia) has much more resources in the analysis area (similarly holds for combinatorics and number theory, cf. e.g. [Tao's blog](http://terrytao.wordpress.com)), than in category and homotopy theory, topology, geometry, cohomology and descent theory and so on, which are more in our primary focus.  

Some of the $n$lab entries related to __mathematical analysis__ include [[nonstandard analysis]], [[Weierstrass preparation theorem]], [[Legendre polynomial]], [[analytic geometry]], [[differential geometry]], [[Hilbert space]], [[Banach space]], [[Banach algebra]], [[operator algebras]], [[Gelfand spectrum]]...and a book entry [[Handbook of analysis and its foundations]]. Many of the basic notions used in analysis courses are described in the general [[topology|topological]] context if they belong there, e.g. [[compact space]], [[continuous map]] and so on. 

Various smoothness concepts in geometry, rarely studied in standard courses of analysis, but sometimes relevant, were studied to fair extent in the $n$lab, see e.g. [[differential form]], [[generalized smooth space]], [[Frolicher space]], [[synthetic differential geometry]]; some other concepts of smoothness are rather algebraic and are used almost exclusively in the nonanalytic setups, e.f. [[formal smoothness]] of Grothendieck; see also [[algebraic approaches to differential calculus]]. Some other entries are related to the conceptual and categorical understanding of Feynman integral however so far from physical, conceptual and formal point of view only. 

More material and suitable links are welcome.
