## Idea 

For $A$ an [[abelian group|abelian]] [[Lie group]] (often taken to be the [[circle group]] $U(1)$), a [[bundle gerbe]] on $X$ is a representation of a [[cohomology|cocycle]] $c$ in $\mathbf{H}(X,\mathbf{B}^2 A)$.

If a [[central extension]] $A \to \hat G \to G$ is given (often taken to be $U(1) \to U(n) \to P U (n)$) there is a notion of $\hat G$-[[twisted bundle]]s with twist given by $c$.

A _bundle gerbe module_ is the presentation of such a $\hat G$-[[twisted bundle]] corresponding to the presentation of the $\mathbf{B}^2 A$-cocycle by a [[bundle gerbe]].

## Definition

###### Definition


If $Y \to X$ is the [[surjective submersion]] relative to which the [[bundle gerbe]] $c$ is defined, and if 

$$
  L \to Y \times_X Y
$$

is the transition [[line bundle]] of the bundle gerbe, then a **bundle gerbe module** for $c$ is a Hermitean [[vector bundle]]

$$
  E \to Y
$$

equipped with an [[action]]

$$
  \rho : \pi_2^* E \otimes L \to \pi_1^* E
$$

(where $\pi_1, \pi_2 : Y \times_X Y \to Y$ are the two projections out of the [[fiber product]])

that respects the bundle gerbe product

$$
  \mu : \pi_{12}^* L \otimes \pi_{2 3}^* L 
  \to \pi_{1 3}^* L
$$

in the obvious way.

When $Y = \coprod_i U_i$ comes form an an open [[cover]] $\{U_i \to X\}$ the above almost manifestly reproduces the explicit description of [[twisted bundle]]s given there.
