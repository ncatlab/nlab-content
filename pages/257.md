#Idea#

A __model category__ (sometimes called a _Quillen model category_ or a _closed model category_) is a [[category]] equipped with extra structure which allows one to treat it as a [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presentation]] for an $(\infty,1)$-[[(infinity,1)-category|category]], i.e. as a model for [[homotopy theory]].

In particular a [[combinatorial simplicial model category]] $\mathbf{A}$ presents the $(\infty,1)$-[[(infinity,1)-category|category]] $\mathbf{A}^\circ$ in the form of a [[simplicially enriched category]] given by the full [[SSet]]-[[enriched category|enriched subcategory]] on objects that are both fibrant and cofibrant.

The idea of model categories is to work just with 1-morphisms instead of with $n$-morphisms for all $n$, but to carry around extra information to remember which 1-morphisms should become [[equivalence|equivalences]] in the full $(\infty,1)$-category, along with additional data which allows us to perform many $(\infty,1)$-categorical constructions at the level of the model category.

Most importantly, a model category is a [[category with weak equivalences]]. The collection of weak equivalences already determines the corresponding $(\infty,1)$-[[(infinity,1)-category|category]]. The rest of the structure carried by a model category -- the choice of [[fibration]]s and [[cofibration]]s -- is auxiliary data whose purpose is to _facilitate computations_, in particular to facilitate the computation of the [[homotopy category]] and of [[derived functor]]s.  See [[homotopy theory]] for more details.

#Definition#

A **model structure** on a category $K$ consists of three distinguished classes of morphisms - the **cofibrations** $C$, the **fibrations** $F$, and the **weak equivalences** $W$ - satisfying the following two properties.

(i) $W$ is closed under retracts in the arrow category and has the **2 of 3** property: given a composable pair of morphisms $f,g$ if two of three of $f, g, g f$ are in $W$, so is the third. 

(ii) $(C, F \cap W)$ and $(C \cap W, F)$ are two [[weak factorization system|weak factorization systems]] on $K$.

A **model category** is a complete and cocomplete category $K$ with a model structure $(C,F,W)$.

#Notes#

* Some authors, notably Mark Hovey, require that the factorizations given by (ii) are actually _functorial_. In practice, Quillen's [[small object argument]] means that many model categories can be made to have functorial factorizations.

* As a consequence of the above definition, the classes $C, F,$ and $W$ are all closed under retracts and composition and contain the isomorphisms of $K$. This is least obvious in the case of $W$. In the presence of functorial factorizations, it is easy to show that closure under retracts follows from (i) and (ii); with a bit of cleverness, this can also be done without functoriality.

#Examples#

Historically, the most important examples have been the following.

* [[model structure on topological spaces]]
* [[model structure on chain complexes]]
* [[model structure on simplicial sets]]

  * the standard structure that models [[infinity-groupoid]]s  in terms of [[Kan complex]]es and is [[Quillen equivalence|Quillen equivalent]] to (nice) topological spaces, 

  * and the Joyal structure which models $(\infty,1)$-[[(infinity,1)-category|categories]] in terms of [[quasi-category|quasi-categories]].

The parameterized version of the model structure on simplicial sets is

* [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]]

which serves as a [[models for infinity-stack (infinity,1)-toposes|model for infinity-stack (infinity,1)-toposes]].

These are based on more generally available 

* [[projective model structure|global model structures on functor categories]]

such as

* [[Reedy model structure]]s .

A source of relevance in practice of new model structures from old ones is [[Bousfield localization]].

Many notions of [[higher category theory|higher categories]] come equipped with model structures, witnessing the fact that when retaining only invertible transformations between $n$-categories they should form an $(\infty,1)$-[[(infinity,1)-category|category]].
