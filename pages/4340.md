In [[logic]], the __true__ proposition, or __truth__, is the [[proposition]] which is the [[top element]] in the [[poset]] of [[truth values]].  In [[categorical logic]], we identify it with the $1$-element ([[singleton]]) [[set]], or in more advanced treatments, the unique [[(-2)-groupoid]], the [[point]].  The truth is commonly denoted $T$, $\top$, or $1$.

In [[two-valued logic]], any truth value which is not true is [[false]].
