## Idea

Classically in [[complex geometry]], an _elliptic curve_ is a connected [[Riemann surface]] (a connected compact 1-dimensional [[complex manifold]]) of [[genus of a surface|genus]] 1, hence it is a [[torus]] equipped with the structure of a [[complex manifold]], or equivalently with [[conformal structure]]. 

The curious term "elliptic" is a remnant from the 19th century, a back-formation which refers to [[elliptic functions]] (generalizing circular functions, i.e., the classical trigonometric functions) and their natural domains as Riemann surfaces. 

In more modern frameworks and in the generality of [[algebraic geometry]], an elliptic curve over a [[field]] $k$ or indeed over any [[commutative ring]] may be defined as a complete irreducible non-singular [[algebraic curve]] of [[arithmetic genus]]-1 over $k$, or even as a certain type of algebraic [[group scheme]]. 

Elliptic curves have many remarkable properties, and their deeper arithmetic study is one of the most profound subjects in present-day mathematics. 

The [[moduli stack of elliptic curves]] equipped with its canonical map to the [[moduli stack of formal group laws]] plays a central role in [[chromatic homotopy theory]] at [[chromatic level]] 2, where it serves to parameterize [[elliptic cohomology theories]].

Elliptic curves over the complex numbers are also interpreted as those [[worldsheets]] in [[string theory]] whose [[correlators]] are the [[superstring]]'s [[partition function]], which is the [[Witten genus]]. Via the [[string orientation of tmf]] this connects to to the role of elliptic curves in [[elliptic cohomology theory]].


## Definition 

### Over a general ring
 {#DefinitionOverGeneralRing}

Elliptic curves over a general [[commutative ring]] $R$ are the well-behaved 1-dimensional [[group objects]] parameterized over the [[space]] $Spec(R)$ (the [[prime spectrum of a commutative ring|prime spectrum]] of $R$). (Notice the count of dimension: over the complex numbers a torus is complex 1-dimensional and in this sense one is looking at 1-dimensional group schemes here.) This we discuss below in 

* [Conceptual definition](#OverGeneralRingConceptualDefinition)

More concretely there are various explicit and standard [[coordinates|coordinazations]] of elliptic curves as [[affine schemes]], hence as solution spaces to [[polynomial]] [[equations]]. This we discuss below in 

* [Coordinatized as solutions to cubic equations](#OverGeneralRingAsSolutionsToEquations)


#### Conceptual definition
 {#OverGeneralRingConceptualDefinition}

+-- {: .num_defn #EllipticCurve}
###### Definition

An **elliptic curve** over a  [[commutative ring]] $R$ is a [[group scheme]] (a [[group object]] in the [[category]] of [[schemes]]) over $Spec(R)$ that is a relative 1-dimensional, [[smooth scheme|smooth]], [[proper scheme|proper]] curve over $R$. 

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

This implies that an elliptic curve has [[arithmetic genus]] $1$ (by a direct argument concerning the [[Chern class]] of the [[tangent bundle]].)

=--

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

An elliptic curve over a [[field]] of [[positive number|positive]] [[characteristic]] whose [[formal group law]] has [[height of a formal group|height]] equal to 2 is called a _[[supersingular elliptic curve]]_. Otherwise the height equals 1 and the elliptic curve is called _ordinary_.

=--

#### Coordinatized as solutions to cubic Weierstrass equations
 {#OverGeneralRingAsSolutionsToEquations}

Elliptic curves are examples of solutions to [[Diophantine equations]] of degree 3. We start by giving the equation valued over general rings, which is fairly complicated compared to the special case that it reduces to in the classical case over the [[complex numbers]]. The more elements in the ground ring are invertible, the more the equation may be simplified.

(See [Silverman 09, III.1](#Silverman09) for a textbook account and for instance ([QuickIntro](#QuickIntro)) for a quick survey.)

##### Weierstrass cubic, discriminant and $j$-invariant
 {#WeierstrassCubicDiscriminantAndJInvariant}

+-- {: .num_defn #GeneralWeierstrassCubic}
###### Definition

Let $R$ be a [[commutative ring]], then [[Zariski topology|Zariski locally]] over $Spec(R)$ a [[cubic curve]] is a solution in the corresponding [[projective space]] to an [[equation]] of the form

$$
  y^2 + a_1 x y + a_3 y = x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_4 x + a_6
$$

for [[coefficients]] $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_6$.  This is called the _[[Weierstrass equation]]_. 

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Much of the literature on elliptic curves considers def. \ref{GeneralWeierstrassCubic} for the case that $R$ is an [[algebraically closed field]], in which case there is no need to pass to a cover. But for the true global discussion necessary for the [[moduli stack of elliptic curves]] one needs the full generality.

=--


The [[non-singular algebraic variety|non-singular]] such solutions are the elliptic curves over $R$. Non-singularity is embodied in coordinates  as follows.

+-- {: .num_defn #DiscriminantAndJInvariant}
###### Definition

Let

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    b_2 & \coloneqq a_1^2 + 4 a_2
    \\
    b_4 &\coloneqq a_1 a_3 + 2a_4
    \\
    b_6 & \coloneqq a_3^2 + 4 a_6
    \\
    b_8 & \coloneqq a_1^2 a_6 - a_1 a_3 a_4 + a_2 a_3^2 + 4 a_2 a_6 - a_4^2
  \end{aligned}
$$

and in terms of these

$$
  \begin{aligned}
     c_4 & \coloneqq b_2^2 - 24 b_4
     \\
     c_6 & \coloneqq - b_2^3 + 36 b_2 b_4 - 216 b_6
     \\
     \Delta &\coloneqq - b_2^2 b_8 - 8 b_4^3 - 27 g_6^2 + 9 b_2 b_4 b_6
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

Here $\Delta$ is called the **[[discriminant]]**.  

Finally let

$$
  j \coloneqq c_4^3/\Delta
  \,,
$$

called the **[[j-invariant]]**.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark #RelationBetweenDiscriminantAndTheModularInvariants}
###### Remark

In def. \ref{DiscriminantAndJInvariant} the discriminant satisfies the relation

$$
  1728 \Delta = c_4^3 - c_6^2
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Over $R = \mathbb{C}$ the [[complex numbers]] the quantities $c_4$ and $c_6$ in def. \ref{DiscriminantAndJInvariant} are proportional to the [[modular forms]] called the [[Eisenstein series]] (see there)  $G_4$ and $G_6$.

=--

##### Elliptic curves, Nodal curves, Cuspidal curves
 {#EllipticCurvesNodalCurvesCuspidalCurves}

The following is a definition if one takes the coordinate-description as fundamental. If one takes the more abstract characterization of def. \ref{EllipticCurve} as fundamental then the following is a proposition.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition/Proposition

A solution to the Weierstrass cubic, def. \ref{GeneralWeierstrassCubic}, with modular invariants $c_4$, $c_6$ and discriminant $\Delta$ according to def. \ref{DiscriminantAndJInvariant} is

1. an _elliptic curve_ iff $\Delta \neq 0$;

1. a _[[nodal curve]]_ or _[[cubic curve]] with nodal [[singular point of an algebraic variety|singularity]]_  iff $\Delta = 0$ and $c_4 \neq 0$;

1. a _[[cuspidal curve]]_ or _[[cubic curve]] with [[cusp]] [[singular point of an algebraic variety|singularity]]_  iff $\Delta = 0$ and $c_4 = 0$ (which by remark \ref{RelationBetweenDiscriminantAndTheModularInvariants} is equivalent to $c_4 = 0$ and $c_6 = 0$)

=--


##### Localization at 2 and 3

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

If $2$ is invertible in $R$ (is a [[unit]] ), and hence generally over the [[localization of a ring|localization]] $R[\frac{1}{2}]$ of $R$ at 2, the general [[Weierstrass equation]], def. \ref{GeneralWeierstrassCubic}, is equivalent, to the equation

$$
  y^2  = 4 x^3  + b_2 x^2 + 2 b_4 x + b_6
$$

with the [[coefficients]] identified as in def. \ref{DiscriminantAndJInvariant}.

If moreover $3$ is also invertible in $R$, hence generally over $R[\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}]$ then this equation is equivalent to just

$$
  y^2 = x^3 - 27 c_4 x - 54 c_6
 \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Finally if $R= \mathbb{C}$ is the [[complex numbers]], then complex tori are indeed the solutions to this last equation parameterized by a [[torus]] $z \in \mathbb{C}/\Lambda$ (as discussed in the section [over the complex numbers](#OverTheComplexNumbers)) via the [[Weierstrass elliptic function]] $p$ as
$(x = p(z), y = p'(z), )$ in the form

$$
  p'(z)^2 + 4 p(z)^3 - g_2 p(z) - g_3
  \,.
$$

=--

See e.g. ([Hain 08, section 5](#Hain08)) on how complex elliptic curves are expressed in this algebraic geometric fashion.

### Over the complex numbers
 {#OverTheComplexNumbers}

+-- {: .num_prop #CharacterizationOverC}
###### Proposition

An [[elliptic curve]], def. \ref{EllipticCurve}, over the [[complex numbers]] $\mathbb{C}$ is equivalently

* a [[Riemann surface]] $X$ of [[genus]] 1 with a fixed point $P \in X$

* a quotient $\mathbb{C}/\Lambda$ where $\Lambda$ is a [[lattice]] in $\mathbb{C}$;

* a compact complex [[Lie group]] of dimension 1.

* a [[smooth scheme|smooth]] [[algebraic curve]] of degree 3 in $\mathcal{P}$.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

From the second definition it follows that to study the 
[[moduli space of elliptic curves]] it suffices to study the [[moduli space]] of [[lattices]] in $\mathbb{C}$.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A **[[framed elliptic curve]]** is an elliptic curve $(X,P)$ in the sense of the first item in prop. \ref{CharacterizationOverC}, together with an [[ordering|ordered]] [[basis]] $(a,b)$ of $H_1(X, \mathbb{Z})$ with $(a \cdot b) = 1 $

A **framed lattice** in $\mathbb{C}$ is a lattice $\Lambda$ together with an ordered basis $(\lambda_1, \lambda_2)$ of $\Lambda$ such that $Im(\lambda_2/\lambda_1) \gt 0$.

## Level structures

(...) [[level structure on an elliptic curve]]

## Properties

### Group law 

Given an [[elliptic curve]] over $R$, $E \to Spec R$, we get a [[formal group]] $\hat E$ by completing $D$ along its identity [[section]] $\sigma_0$

$$
  E \to Spec(R) \stackrel{\sigma_0}{\to} E
  \,,
$$

we get a [[ringed space]] $(\hat E, \hat O_{E,0})$



+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example


If $R$ is a [[field]] $k$, then the [[structure sheaf]] $\hat O_{E,0} \simeq k[ [z] ]$

then 

$$
  \hat O_{E \times E, (0,0)} \simeq
  \hat O_{E,0}
  \hat \otimes_k
  \hat O_{E,0}
  \simeq 
  k[[x,y]]
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

**(Jacobi quartics)**

$$
  y^2 = 1- 2 \delta x^2 + \epsilon x^4
$$

defines $E$ over $R = \mathbb{Z}[Y_Z,\epsilon, \delta]$.

The corresponding [[formal group law]] is **Euler's formal group law**

$$
  f(x,y) = \frac{x\sqrt{1- 2 \delta y^2 + \epsilon y^4}
   + y \sqrt{1- 2 \delta x^2 + \epsilon x^4}}
  {1- \epsilon x^2 y^2}
$$

if $\Delta := \epsilon(\delta^2 - \epsilon)^2 \neq 0$ then this is a non-trivial elliptic curve.

=--

If $\Delta = 0$ then $f(x,y) \simeq G_m, G_a$ ([[additive group|additive]] or [[multiplicative group|multiplicative]] formal group law corresponding to [[integral cohomology]] and [[K-theory]], respectively).

### Relation to elliptic cohomology 

Elliptic curves, via their [[formal group law]]s, give the name to [[elliptic cohomology]] theories.
