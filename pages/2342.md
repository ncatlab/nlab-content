## Idea

Classically, an elliptic curve is a connected Riemann surface (a connected compact 1-dimensional complex manifold) of genus 1. The curious term "elliptic" is a remnant from the 19th century, a back-formation which refers to elliptic functions (generalizing circular functions, i.e., the classical trigonometric functions) and their natural domains as Riemann surfaces. 

In more modern frameworks, an elliptic curve over a field $k$ may be defined as a complete irreducible non-singular algebraic curve of genus 1 over $k$, or even as a certain type of algebraic group scheme. Elliptic curves have many remarkable properties, and their deeper arithmetic study is one of the most profound subjects in present-day mathematics. 


### History 

Probably should pass through Riemann and Weierstrass, to explain "elliptic". 


## Definition 

### Over a general ring

+-- {: .num_defn #EllipticCurve}
###### Definition

An **elliptic curve** over a  [[commutative ring]] $R$ is a [[group object]] in the [[category]] of [[scheme]]s over $R$ that is a relative 1-dimensional, , [[smooth scheme|smooth curve]], [[proper scheme|proper]] curve over $R$. 

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

This implies that an elliptic curva has [[genus]] 1. (by a direct argument concerning the [[Chern class]] of the [[tangent bundle]].)

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

An elliptic curve over a [[field]] of [[positive number|positive]] [[characteristic]] whose [[formal group law]] has [[height of a formal group]] equal to 2 is called a _[[supersingular elliptic curve]]_. Otherwise the height equals 1 and the elliptic curve is called _ordinary_.

### Over the complex numbers

+-- {: .num_prop #CharacterizationOverC}
###### Proposition

An [[elliptic curve]], def. \ref{EllipticCurve}, over the [[complex numbers]] $\mathbb{C}$ is equivalently

* a [[Riemann surface]] $X$ of [[genus]] 1 with a fixed point $P \in X$

* a quotient $\mathbb{C}/\Lambda$ where $\Lambda$ is a [[lattice]] in $\mathbb{C}$;

* a compact complex [[Lie group]] of dimension 1.

* a [[smooth scheme|smooth]] [[algebraic curve]] of degree 3 in $\mathcal{P}$.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

From the second definition it follows that to study the 
[[moduli space of elliptic curves]] it suffices to study the [[moduli space]] of [[lattices]] in $\mathbb{C}$.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A **[[framed elliptic curve]]** is an elliptic curve $(X,P)$ in the sense of the first item in prop. \ref{CharacterizationOverC}, together with an [[ordering|ordered]] [[basis]] $(a,b)$ of $H_1(X, \mathbb{Z})$ with $(a \cdot b) = 1 $

A **framed lattice** in $\mathbb{C}$ is a lattice $\Lambda$ together with an ordered basis $(\lambda_1, \lambda_2)$ of $\Lambda$ such that $Im(\lambda_2/\lambda_1) \gt 0$.

## Properties

### Group law 

Given an [[elliptic curve]] over $R$, $E \to Spec R$, we get a [[formal group]] $\hat E$ by completing $D$ along its identity [[section]] $\sigma_0$

$$
  E \to Spec(R) \stackrel{\sigma_0}{\to} E
  \,,
$$

we get a [[ringed space]] $(\hat E, \hat O_{E,0})$



+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example


If $R$ is a [[field]] $k$, then the [[structure sheaf]] $\hat O_{E,0} \simeq k[ [z] ]$

then 

$$
  \hat O_{E \times E, (0,0)} \simeq
  \hat O_{E,0}
  \hat \otimes_k
  \hat O_{E,0}
  \simeq 
  k[[x,y]]
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

**(Jacobi quartics)**

$$
  y^2 = 1- 2 \delta x^2 + \epsilon x^4
$$

defines $E$ over $R = \mathbb{Z}[Y_Z,\epsilon, \delta]$.

The corresponding [[formal group law]] is **Euler's formal group law**

$$
  f(x,y) = \frac{x\sqrt{1- 2 \delta y^2 + \epsilon y^4}
   + y \sqrt{1- 2 \delta x^2 + \epsilon x^4}}
  {1- \epsilon x^2 y^2}
$$

if $\Delta := \epsilon(\delta^2 - \epsilon)^2 \neq 0$ then this is a non-trivial elliptic curve.

=--

If $\Delta = 0$ then $f(x,y) \simeq G_m, G_a$ ([[additive group|additive]] or [[multiplicative group|multiplicative]] formal group law corresponding to [[integral cohomology]] and [[K-theory]], respectively).

### Relation to elliptic cohomology 

Elliptic curves, via their [[formal group law]]s, give the name to [[elliptic cohomology]] theories.
