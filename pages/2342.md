Classically, an elliptic curve is a connected Riemann surface (a connected compact 1-dimensional complex manifold) of genus 1. The curious term "elliptic" is a remnant from the 19th century, a back-formation which refers to elliptic functions (generalizing circular functions, i.e., the classical trigonometric functions) and their natural domains as Riemann surfaces. 

In more modern frameworks, an elliptic curve over a field $k$ may be defined as a complete irreducible non-singular algebraic curve of genus 1 over $k$, or even as a certain type of algebraic group scheme. Elliptic curves have many remarkable properties, and their deeper arithmetic study is one of the most profound subjects in present-day mathematics. 

## History 

Probably should pass through Riemann and Weierstrass, to explain "elliptic". 

# Definition #


**Definition** An **elliptic curve** over a commutative [[ring]] $R$ is a [[group object]] in the [[category]] of [[scheme]]s over $R$ that is a relative 1-dimensional, , [[smooth scheme|smooth curve]], [[proper scheme|proper]] curve over $R$. 

This implies that it has [[genus]] 1. (by a direct argument concerning the [[Chern class]] of the [[tangent bundle]].)

## group law ##

Given an [[elliptic curve]] over $R$, $E \to Spec R$, we get a [[formal group]] $\hat E$ by completing $D$ along its identity [[section]] $\sigma_0$

$$
  E \to Spec(R) \stackrel{\sigma_0}{\to} E
  \,,
$$

we get a [[ringed space]] $(\hat E, \hat O_{E,0})$



**example** if $R$ is a [[field]] $k$, then the [[structure sheaf]] $\hat O_{E,0} \simeq k[ [z] ]$

then 

$$
  \hat O_{E \times E, (0,0)} \simeq
  \hat O_{E,0}
  \hat \otimes_k
  \hat O_{E,0}
  \simeq 
  k[[x,y]]
$$



**example** **(Jacobi quartics)**

$$
  y^2 = 1- 2 \delta x^2 + \epsilon x^4
$$

defines $E$ over $R = \mathbb{Z}[Y_Z,\epsilon, \delta]$.

The corresponding [[formal group law]] is **Euler's formal group law**

$$
  f(x,y) = \frac{x\sqrt{1- 2 \delta y^2 + \epsilon y^4}
   + y \sqrt{1- 2 \delta x^2 + \epsilon x^4}}
  {1- \epsilon x^2 y^2}
$$

if $\Delta := \epsilon(\delta^2 - \epsilon)^2 \neq 0$ then this is a non-trivial elliptic curve.

If $\Delta = 0$ then $f(x,y) \simeq G_m, G_a$ (additive or multiplicative formal group law corresponding to [[integral cohomology]] and [[K-theory]], respectively).

# role in cohomology theories #

Elliptic curves, via their [[formal group law]]s, give the name to [[elliptic cohomology]] theories.
