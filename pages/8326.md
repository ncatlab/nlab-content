### On being and becoming
 {#OnBeingAndBecoming}

from ([EPSBOI](#EPSBOI))*:

* Sec. 86 Pure [[being]] constitutes the beginning, because it is pure thought as well as the undetermined, simple immediate, and the first beginning cannot be anything mediated and further determined.

* 87 Now this pure being is a pure abstraction and thus the absolutely negative which, when likewise taken immediately, is nothing.

* 88 Conversely, nothing, as this immediate, self-same [category], is likewise the same as being. The truth of being as well as of nothing is therefore the unity of both; this unity is [[becoming]].


Remark: A proposal for a formalization of _[[being]]_ and _[[becoming]]_ is later given by [[Bill Lawvere]] in terms of the notion of _[[cohesive topos]]_, see at _[[Some Thoughts on the Future of Category Theory]]_.
