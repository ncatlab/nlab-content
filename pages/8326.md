## Survey
 {#Survey}

> With Hegel you're getting what seems to us today a curious package. The whole dynamic (or 'dialectic') of the unfolding of the Logik is prior to any actual thinking, realised in concrete humans. In fact, the world, and that part of it which is human thought, is the Idea (or Spirit) realising itself. I say 'curious', but in a way I'm hearing echoes of this in things Urs is suggesting, as though the universe worked itself out according to type theory. For Hegel one isn't to be a Kantian, where what one theorises about the universe is just how the universe is taken up by the human understanding, with the further idea that this will be limited in certain ways, e.g., no access to the thing-in-itself. For Hegel, the human mind itself is part of the universe and as such part of the unfolding of the Idea/Spirit. $[\cdots]$ It's a dizzying picture which tends either to delight or revolt people. $[$ See at _[[absolute idealism]]_ $]$ ([Corfield](http://nforum.mathforge.org/discussion/4117/the-wiki-history-of-the-universe/?Focus=34343#Comment_34343))


## Topics of Volume One: The objective logic

The following extracts some paragraphs from the text, with comments. The numebers refer to the paragraph numbers as given in the English translation at _[Hegel-by-hypertext](http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/index.htm)_ _[Hegel's science of logic](http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/)_.

## Book one: The Doctrine of being

### First section: Determinateness (Quality)

#### First chapter

##### A. Being
 {#OnBeingAndBecoming}


* 86 Pure [[being]] constitutes the beginning, because it is pure thought as well as the undetermined, simple immediate, and the first beginning cannot be anything mediated and further determined.

* 87 Now this pure being is a pure abstraction and thus the absolutely negative which, when likewise taken immediately, is nothing.

* 88 Conversely, nothing, as this immediate, self-same category, is likewise the same as being. The truth of being as well as of nothing is therefore the unity of both; this unity is [[becoming]].

##### B. Nothing

##### C. Becoming

###### 1. Unity of Being and Nothing

###### 2. Moments of Becoming

###### 3. Sublating of Becoming

#### Second chapter. Determinate Being (Dasein)

##### A. Dasein as such

###### a. Dasein überhaupt

###### b. Qualität

###### c. Etwas

##### B. Die Endlichkeit

##### C. Die Unendlichkeit

#### Third chapter. Das Fürsichsein

##### A. Das Fürsichsein als solches

##### B. Eins und Vieles.

###### a. Das Eins an ihm selbst

###### b. Das Eins und das Leere

###### c. Viele Eins. Repulsion

See also [Lawvere's Cohesive toposes and Lauter Einsen ](#LawvereLauterEinsen))

##### C. Repulsion und Attraktion

###### a. Ausschlißen des Eins.

###### b. Das Eine Eins der Attraktion

###### c. Die Beziehung der Repulsion und der Attraktion

###### Remark: The Kantian Construction of Matter from the Forces of Attraction and Repulsion


* 374 Kant, as we know, constructed matter from the forces of attraction and repulsion, or at least he has, to use his own words, set up the metaphysical elements of this construction.

Not about actual [[forces]] in [[matter]] so much as about what makes the points in the [[continuum]] both stay apart (repulsion) and at the same time hang together (attraction/cohesion).



### Second section. The magnitude

#### First chapter. Die Quantität / The quantity

##### A. Die reine Quantität


###### On attraction / cohesion 

* 395 Attraction is in this way the moment of continuity in quantity.

attraction is what holds stuff together, hence this is the idea of [[cohesion]]

if $X$ has continuity then the [[shape modality]] $\int X$ is the result of letting things collaps under their cohesion/attraction


###### On discreteness and repulsion

* 397 In continuity, therefore, magnitude immediately possesses the moment of discreteness — repulsion, as now a moment in quantity. 

continuous object $X$ possesses moment 
of [[discrete object|discreteness]]= [[flat modality]] $\flat X$

* 398 Quantity is the unity of these moments of continuity and discreteness,

the [[flat modality]] [[counit of a comonad|co-unit]]:

$$
  quantity
  \;\colon\;
  \array{ 
    \flat X &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    discreteness && continuity
  } 
$$

We may regard a [[morphism]] as the collection of its [[homotopy fibers]] and that the homotopy fiber of $\flat X \to X$ is the [de Rham coefficient object](cohesive+(infinity,1)-topos+--+structures#deRhamCohomology) $\flat_{dR} X$.


so 

$$
  \array{
    \flat X &\longrightarrow& X &\longrightarrow& \int X
    \\
    repulsion && continuity && attraction
  }
$$


##### B. Kontinuirliche und diskrete

###### On the continuum

* 400 Mathematics, on the other hand, rejects a metaphysics which would make time consist of points of time; space in general — or in the first place the line — consist of points of space; the plane, of lines; and total space of planes. It allows no validity to such discontinuous ones. Even though, for instance, in determining the magnitude of a plane, it represents it as the sum of infinitely many lines, this discreteness counts only as a momentary representation, and the sublation of the discreteness is already implied in the infinite plurality of the lines, since the space which they are supposed to constitute is after all bounded.

The [[continuum]].


> Diese Antinomie besteht allein, darin daß die Diskretion eben so sehr als die Kontinuität behauptet werden muß. Die einseitige Behauptung der Diskretion giebt das unendliche oder absolute Getheiltseyn, somit ein Untheilbares zum Princip; die einseitige Behauptung der Kontinuität dagegen die unendliche Theilbarkeit.


###### On space, time, matter

* 432 Space, time, matter, and so forth are continuous magnitudes 




##### C. Begrenzung der Quantität 

#### Second chapter. Quantum





## Book two: The doctrine of essence

### On identity

On [[identity]].

* **903** All things are different; or: there are no two things like each other.

Reminiscent of [[identity types]] in [[intensional type theory]].


### Third section. The measure.
