## Survey
 {#Survey}

> With Hegel you're getting what seems to us today a curious package. The whole dynamic (or '[[dialectic]]') of the unfolding of the [[logos|Logik]] is prior to any actual thinking, realised in concrete humans. In fact, the world, and that part of it which is human thought, is the Idea (or Spirit) realising itself. I say 'curious', but in a way I'm hearing echoes of this in things Urs is suggesting, as though the universe worked itself out according to [[type theory]]. For Hegel one isn't to be a Kantian, where what one theorises about the universe is just how the universe is taken up by the human understanding, with the further idea that this will be limited in certain ways, e.g., no access to the thing-in-itself. For Hegel, the human mind itself is part of the universe and as such part of the unfolding of the Idea/Spirit. $[\cdots]$ It's a dizzying picture which tends either to delight or revolt people. $[$ See at _[[absolute idealism]]_ $]$ ([Corfield](http://nforum.mathforge.org/discussion/4117/the-wiki-history-of-the-universe/?Focus=34343#Comment_34343))


## Topics of Volume One: The objective logic

The following extracts some paragraphs from the text, with comments on how to possibly think about this in terms of [[homotopy type theory]], along the lines that [[William Lawvere]] has been suggesting over the decades. 

The paragraph numbers refer to the numbers as given in the English translation at _[Hegel-by-hypertext](http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/index.htm)_ _[Hegel's science of logic](http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/)_.

### Heraclitus and the notion of Becoming
 {#Heraclitus}

Hegel wrote (according to [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel#Heraclitus)):

"[[Heraclitus]] is the one who first declared the nature of the infinite and first grasped nature as in itself infinite, that is, its essence as process. The origin of [[philosophy]] is to be dated from Heraclitus. His is the persistent Idea that is the same in all philosophers up to the present day, as it was the Idea of Plato and Aristotle."

"... there is no proposition of Heraclitus which I have not adopted in my logic."


### Formalization of Unity of Opposites
 {#OppositesAndUnity}

Hegel famously invokes opposite to the extent of [[paradoxes]], as sources for new phenomena via their synthesis.
On p. 11 of _[Cohesive toposes and Cantor's Lauter Einsen](#LawvereLauterEinsen)_ [[William Lawvere]] proposes that generally such is captured by [[adjoint pairs]] of [[idempotent]] [[monads]]/[[comonads]] ("[[adjoint cylinders]]"), such as

$\flat \dashv \sharp$

[[flat modality]] $\dashv$ [[sharp modality]]

This gives unifying triples of the form

$$
  \array{
    \flat X &\longrightarrow& X &\longrightarrow& \sharp X
    \\
    \\
    opposite\;1 && unity && opposite\;2
  }
  \,.
$$

for any [[type]] $X$.


Several examples of this appear below.

Notice that indeed a fair bit of structure follows from maps of this form.

For instance for the [points-to-pieces transform](cohesive%20topos#CanonicalComparison) induced by the [[shape modality]] $\dashv$ [[flat modality]] dichotmy $\int \dashv \flat$,
we have, as discussed at [tangent cohesion -- Cohesive and differential refinement](#tangent+cohesive+%28∞%2C1%29-topos#CohesiveAndDifferentialRefinement)

$$
  \array{
    &&  \int_{dR} \Omega A && \longrightarrow && \flat_{dR}\Sigma A
    \\
    & \nearrow & & \searrow & & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\theta_A}} && \searrow
    \\
    \flat \int_{dR} \Omega A  && && A && && \int \flat_{dR}\Sigma A
    \\
    & \searrow &  & \nearrow & & \searrow && \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\int \theta_A}}
    \\
    && \flat A && \longrightarrow && \int A
  }
  \,,
$$

### Formalization dictionary

We may suggest the following rough dictionary between Hegel's informal terms and formalization in [[homotopy type theory]]

| Hegel's logic |  [[modal type theory|modal]] [[homotopy type theory]] |
|-----|------|
| quality | $\sim$ [[type]] |
| determinate being of quality $X$ | $\vdash X \colon Type$ |
| moment | [[modality]] |
| unity of opposites |  [[adjoint modality]] |
| ground | [[antecedent]] |
| entering into existence | [[term introduction]] |
| immediacy of reflection | reflector term in [[identity type]] |
| all things are different | [[intensional identity]] |
| being, One  | ([[context]] of) [[unit type]] |
| nothing | [[empty type]] |
| becoming | [[adjoint modality]]  $\emptyset \dashv \ast$ |
| moment of repulsion | [[flat modality]] $\flat$ |
| moment of attraction | [[cohesion]], [[shape modality]] $\int$ |
| continuum | [[adjoint modality]] $\int \dashv \flat$ |
| moment of discreteness | [[flat modality]] $\flat$ |
| moment of continuity | [[sharp modality]] $\sharp$ |
| quantity | [[adjoint modality]] $\flat \dashv \sharp$ |
| vanishing of infinitesimals | [[reduction modality]] |
| moment of two negations | [[double negation modality]] $\not \not$, more generally: [[bracket type]]/[[n-truncation modality|(-1)-truncation modality]] |
| something | [[n-truncation modality|(-1)-truncation modality]], classically [[double negation modality]] |

Notice that the above involves the first two stages in the tower
of [[n-truncation modalities]]:

| $n$ | [[n-truncation modality]] |
|--|--|
| -2 | [[unit type]] modality |
| -1 | [[n-truncation modality|(-1)-truncation modality]], [[classical logic|classically]] [[double negation modality]] |


## **Book one** Die Lehre vom Sein / The Doctrine of Being

### $\;\;$ Womit muss der Anfang der Wissenschaft gemacht werden?

### $\;\;$ Allgemeine Einteilung des Seins


### First section: Determinateness (Quality)

#### First chapter

* §86 Pure [[being]] constitutes the beginning, because it is pure thought as well as the undetermined, simple immediate, and the first beginning cannot be anything mediated and further determined.

* §87 Now this pure being is a pure abstraction and thus the absolutely negative which, when likewise taken immediately, is nothing.

* §88 Conversely, nothing, as this immediate, self-same category, is likewise the same as being. The truth of being as well as of nothing is therefore the unity of both; this unity is [[becoming]].


##### A. Being
 {#OnBeingAndBecoming}

* §132 Being, pure being, [...] it has no diversity within itself nor any with a reference outwards.


This is the _[[unit type]]_ $\ast$. 


Indeed, later this is called "Das Eins"  which is maybe indeed better translated as "The Unit" instead of as "The One" as commonly done.


##### B. Nothing

* §133 Nothing, pure nothing: it is simply equality with itself, complete emptiness,

The [[empty type]] $\emptyset$.


##### C. Becoming
 {#Becoming}

* §134 Pure Being and pure nothing are, therefore, the same. What is the truth is neither being nor nothing, but that being — does not pass over but has passed over — into nothing, and nothing into being. But it is equally true that they are not undistinguished from each other, that, on the contrary, they are not the same, that they are absolutely distinct, and yet that they are unseparated and inseparable and that each immediately vanishes in its opposite. Their truth is therefore, this movement of the immediate vanishing of the one into the other: becoming, a movement in which both are distinguished, but by a difference which has equally immediately resolved itself.

According to the formalization of such [[unity of opposites]] as
[above](#OppositesAndUnity) we might think of this as the
universal factorization

$$
  \array{
    \emptyset &\longrightarrow& X &\longrightarrow& \ast 
    \\
    \\
    nothing && becoming && being
  }
$$

of the factorization of the unique [[function]] from the [[empty type]] to the [[unit type]] through any other [[type]] $X$.


Indeed, later it says:

* §174 there is nothing which is not an intermediate state between being and nothing.

Also, [below](#SomethingAndAnOther) it says

* §222 Being and nothing in their unity, which is determinate being

and "determinate being" / Dasein seems to be well interpreted with types expressed as

$$
  \vdash X \colon Type
  \,.
$$


###### 1. Unity of Being and Nothing

###### $\;\;$ Remark 1

###### $\;\;$ Remark 2: Defectiveness of the Expression "Unity, Identity of Being and Nothing"

* §152  But the third in which being and nothing subsist must also present itself here, and it has done so; it is becoming. In this being and nothng are distinct moments; becoming only is, in so, in so far as they are distinguished.

In view of the above it seems that "moment" is well translated with _[[modality]]_.

###### $\;\;$ Remark 3

###### $\;\;$ Remark 4

* §171 It is impossible for anything to begin, either in so far as it is, or in so far as it is not; for in so far as it is, it is not just beginning, and in so far as it is not, then also it does not begin. If the world, or anything, is supposed to have begun, then it must have begun in nothing, but in nothing — or nothing — is no beginning; for a beginning includes within itself a being, but nothing does not contain any being. Nothing is only nothing. In a ground, a cause, and so on, if nothing is so determined, there is contained an affirmation, a being. For the same reason, too, something cannot cease to be; for then being would have to contain nothing, but being is only being, not the contrary of itself.

* §174 The foregoing dialectic is the same, too, as that which understanding employs the notion of infinitesimal magnitudes, given by higher analysis. A more detailed treatment of this notion will be given later. These magnitudes have been defined as such that they are in their vanishing, not before their vanishing, for then they are finite magnitudes, or after their vanishing, for then they are nothing. 

Vanishing of [[infinitesimal objects]] is expressed by the [[reduction modality]] $Red$.

* §174 there is nothing which is not an intermediate state between being and nothing.

The universal factorization for [[unity of opposites]] of the [[empty type]] $\dashv$ [[unit type]] [[adjoint modality]]

$$
  \array{
    \emptyset &\longrightarrow& X &\longrightarrow& \ast 
    \\
    \\
    nothing && becoming && being
  }
$$

of the factorization of the unique [[function]] from the [[empty type]] to the [[unit type]] through any other [[type]] $X$.



###### 2. Moments of Becoming

###### 3. Sublating of Becoming

#### Second chapter. Determinate Being (Dasein)

* §188 In considering determinate being the emphasis falls on its determinate character; the determinateness is in the form of being, and as such it is quality.

##### A. Dasein as such / Determinate being as such

###### a. Dasein überhaupt / Determinant being in general

* §191 From becoming there issues determinate being, which is the simple oneness of being and nothing.

Above we saw that _becoming_ is formalized by the universal [[unity of opposites]] of $\emptyset \dashv \ast$, exhibiting any [[type]] $X$

$$
  \emptyset \longrightarrow X \longrightarrow \ast
  \,.
$$

So determinate being/Dasein is that of [[types]].



###### b. Qualität / Quality

* §196 Determinateness thus isolated by itself in the form of being is quality 

###### c. Etwas / Something
 {#Etwas}

* §208 In determinate being its determinateness has been distinguished as quality; in quality as determinately present, there is distinction — of reality and negation. Now although these distinctions are present in determinate being, they are no less equally void and sublated. Reality itself contains negation, is determinate being, not indeterminate, abstract being. Similarly, negation is determinate being, not the supposedly abstract nothing but posited here as it is in itself, as affirmatively present [als seiend], belonging to the sphere of determinate being. Thus quality is completely unseparated from determinate being, which is simply determinate, qualitative being.

* §210 Something is the first negation of negation, as simple self-relation in the form of being.

* §211 Something is the negation of the negation in the form of being;

* § 212 This mediation with itself which something is in itself, taken only as negation of the negation, has no concrete determinations for its sides; it thus collapses into the simple oneness which is being.


Here "double negation" is plausibly matched with the [[double negation modality]].

Concerning "something": if $X$ is a [[type]], then by [[propositions-as-types]] there is _something_ of this type if the type is [[inhabited]]. But [[classical logic|classically]] this is expressed by by its [[double negation modality]]. Hence: there is something of some quality/type if that is a double-negation [[modal type]].


##### B. Die Endlichkeit / Finitude.

###### a. Etwas und ein Anderes. / Something and an Other
 {#SomethingAndAnOther}

* §222 Being and nothing in their unity, which is determinate being

Notice that [above](#Becoming) this unity is called _becoming_.

##### C. Die Unendlichkeit

#### Third chapter. Das Fürsichsein

##### A. Das Fürsichsein als solches

###### a. Dasein und Fürsichsein

###### b. Sein-für-Eines

###### c. Eins

* §329 The moments which constitute the Notion of the one as a being-for-self fall asunder in the development. They are: (1) negation in general, (2) two negations, (3) two that are therefore the same, (4) sheer opposites, (5) self-relation, identity as such, (6) relation which is negative and yet to its own self.

If we translate "moment" as [[modality]] then here the 
[[double negation modality]] comes to mind.

Notice that the [[empty type]] and the [[unit type]] are the [[modal types]] for the [[double negation modality]].

##### B. Eins und Vieles.

###### a. Das Eins an ihm selbst

###### b. Das Eins und das Leere

###### c. Viele Eins. Repulsion. / Many ones. Repulsion.

* §340 The one and the void constitute the first stage of the determinate being of being-for-self. Each of these moments has negation for its determination and is at the same time posited as a determinate being; according to the former determination the one and the void are the relation of negation to negation as of an other to its other: the one is negation in the determination of being, and the void is negation in the determination of non-being.

Das Eins (the One): $\ast$ [[unit type]]

Das Leere (the void): $\emptyset$ [[empty type]] ( _leere Menge_ !)

Negation $(\not X) \coloneqq (X \to \emptyset)$

$\ast \simeq \not \emptyset$.

* §342 the one repels itself from itself. The negative relation of the one to itself is repulsion.

* §343 This repulsion as thus the positing of many ones but through the one itself, is the one's own coming-forth-from-itself but to such outside it as are themselves only ones. This is repulsion according to its Notion, repulsion in itself. The second repulsion is different from it, it is what is immediately suggested to external reflection: repulsion not as the generation of ones, but only as the mutual repelling of ones presupposed as already present. 

Suppose we have a [[shape modality]] $\int$ but without the assumption that it preserves finite product types. (This is what the term "[[shape of an (infinity,1)-topos|shape]]" really refers to).

Then given just the [[empty type]] $\emptyset$ and the [[unit type]] $\ast$, there is one new [[type]] to be formed (since necessarily $\int \emptyset \simeq \emptyset$) and this is

$$
  \int \ast 
$$

Below we see that this, being a [[discrete type]], is what Hegel describes with "repulsion": The points in $\int \ast$ do not attract/cohese, they are different and repel.

At the same time, being a [[discrete type]] it is necessarily a [[homotopy colimit]] of copies of the [[unit type]] (see [here](limit+in+a+quasi-category#Tensoring))

$$
  \int \ast \simeq \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_I \ast
$$

where the [[diagram]] $I$ that the colimit is over is $I = &#643; \ast$ itself.

For a similar argument see Lawvere's  _[Cohesive toposes and Cantor's Lauter Einsen ](#LawvereLauterEinsen))_. On p. 6 there is suggested that the [[unity of opposites]] "all elements of a set are indistinguishable and yet distinct" is captured by the fact that both

$\flat X$ as well as $\sharp X$ have the same image under $\flat$.

##### C. Repulsion und Attraktion

###### a. Ausschlißen des Eins.

###### b. Das Eine Eins der Attraktion

###### c. Die Beziehung der Repulsion und der Attraktion

###### Remark: The Kantian Construction of Matter from the Forces of Attraction and Repulsion


* §374 Kant, as we know, constructed matter from the forces of attraction and repulsion, or at least he has, to use his own words, set up the metaphysical elements of this construction.

Not about actual [[forces]] in [[matter]] so much as about what makes the points in the [[continuum]] both stay apart (repulsion) and at the same time hang together (attraction/cohesion).




### Second section. The magnitude

#### First chapter. Die Quantität / The quantity

##### A. Die reine Quantität / Pure quantity
 {#PureQuantity}


* §398 Quantity is the unity of these moments of continuity and discreteness

By [[unity of opposites]] and since the [[flat modality]] matches the "moment of discreteness" this is the duality with the [[sharp modality]]

$$
  \array{
    \flat X &\longrightarrow& X &\longrightarrow& \sharp X
    \\
    {moment\;of \atop discreteness}
    && 
    &&
    {moment\;of \atop continuity}
  }
$$

###### On attraction / cohesion 

* §395 Attraction is in this way the moment of continuity in quantity.

attraction is what holds stuff together, hence this is the idea of [[cohesion]]

if $X$ has continuity then the [[shape modality]] $\int X$ is the result of letting things collaps under their cohesion/attraction


###### On discreteness and repulsion
 {#OnDiscretenessAndRepulsion}

* §397 In continuity, therefore, magnitude immediately possesses the moment of discreteness — repulsion, as now a moment in quantity. 

continuous object $X$ possesses moment 
of [[discrete object|discreteness]]= [[flat modality]] $\flat X$

* §398 Quantity is the unity of these moments of continuity and discreteness,


By the formalization of [[unity of opposites]] this must mean that 
"moment of continuity" is the [[right adjoint]] [[modality]] to the [[flat modality]].  This is the [[sharp modality]] $\sharp$. Therefore their [[unity of opposites]] is

$$
  quantity
    \;\colon\;
  \array{ 
     \flat X &\longrightarrow& X &\longrightarrow& \sharp X
      \\
      \\
      {moment\;of \atop discreteness}
      &&
      &&
      {moment\;of \atop continuity}  
  } 
$$

Notice that by[[Lawvere]]'s _[Cohesive Toposes and Cantor's "lauter Einsen"](#LawvereLauterEinsen)_ precisely this [[unity of opposites]] is that characteristic of [[cardinality]] (Mengen/Kardinalen).

we also have

$$
  \array{
    \flat X &\longrightarrow& X &\longrightarrow& \int X
    \\
    repulsion &&  && { attraction/ \atop cohesion } 
  }
$$


##### B. Kontinuirliche und diskrete Größe.

###### On the continuum

* §400 Mathematics, on the other hand, rejects a metaphysics which would make time consist of points of time; space in general — or in the first place the line — consist of points of space; the plane, of lines; and total space of planes. It allows no validity to such discontinuous ones. Even though, for instance, in determining the magnitude of a plane, it represents it as the sum of infinitely many lines, this discreteness counts only as a momentary representation, and the sublation of the discreteness is already implied in the infinite plurality of the lines, since the space which they are supposed to constitute is after all bounded.

The [[continuum]].


> Diese Antinomie besteht allein, darin daß die Diskretion eben so sehr als die Kontinuität behauptet werden muß. Die einseitige Behauptung der Diskretion giebt das unendliche oder absolute Getheiltseyn, somit ein Untheilbares zum Princip; die einseitige Behauptung der Kontinuität dagegen die unendliche Theilbarkeit.


###### On space, time, matter

* §432 Space, time, matter, and so forth are continuous magnitudes 




##### C. Begrenzung der Quantität 

#### Second chapter. Quantum


### Third section. The measure.

* §699 Abstractly expressed, in measure quality and quantity are united


* §703 The observation here made extends generally to those systems of pantheism which have been partially developed by thought. The first is being, the one, substance, the infinite, essence; in contrast to this abstraction the second, namely, all determinateness in general, what is only finite, accidental, perishable, non-essential, etc. can equally abstractly be grouped together; and this is what usually happens as the next step in quite formal thinking. But the connection of this second with the first is so evident that one cannot avoid grasping it as also in a unity with the latter;

## **Book two** Die Lehre vom Wesen / The doctrine of essence 

### Reflection

#### Section 1. Essence as Reflection within Itself

##### Chapter 1 Illusory Being
 
##### A The essential and the unessential

##### B Illusory being

##### C Reflection

##### Chapter 2 The Essentialities or Determination of Reflection

###### $\;\;$ Remark $A = A$

* §863 Thus the essential category of identity is enunciated in the proposition: everything is identical with itself, A = A.

The reflector(!) [[term constructor]] in an [[identity type]]. This is more explicit below at _[Identity](#Identity)_.

###### A Identity
 {#Identity}

* §869 Essence is therefore simple identity with self.

* §869 This identity-with-self is the immediacy of reflection.

The reflector(!) [[term constructor]] in an [[identity type]].  Below this is called te _[First original law of thought](#FirstOriginalLawOfThought)_.

###### $\;\;$ Remark 1: Abstract identity

###### $\;\;$ Remark 2: First original law of thought
 {#FirstOriginalLawOfThought}

* §875 In this remark, I will consider in more detail identity as the law of identity which is usually adduced as the first law of thought.

  This proposition in its positive expression $A = A$ is, in the first instance, nothing more than the expression of an empty tautology. 

The reflector [[term constructor]] in an [[identity type]].

###### B Difference

###### $\;\;$ (a) Absolute difference

###### $\;\;$ (b) Diversity

###### $\;\;$ Remark: The Law of Diversity


* §903 All things are different; or: there are no two things like each other.

Reminiscent of [[identity types]] in [[intensional type theory]].

###### C Contradiction

* §903 When all the conditions of a fact are present, it enters into Existence.


* §1035 The fact emerges from the ground. It is not grounded or posited by it in such a manner that ground remains as a substrate; on the contrary, the positing is the movement of the ground outwards to itself and its simple vanishing.

  $[..]$

  This immediacy that is mediated by ground and condition and is self-identical through the sublating of mediation, is Existence.
