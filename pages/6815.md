## Idea

There are two types of [[black brane]] solutions in [[11-dimensional supergravity]], one of dimension $2+1$, one of dimension 5+1. These are thought to correspond to a fundamental 2-brane and its [[electric-magnetic duality|EM dual]], called the

* [[M2-brane]]

* [[M5-brane]]

* [[M9-brane]]

The M2-brane carries [[electric charge]] under the [[supergravity C-field]]. The M5-brane is the dual magnetic charge.

## Properties

### Reduction to branes in 10 d

Under [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|reduction]] to [[type II supergravity]] the M2 and the M5 turn into the [[D-brane]]s and the [[NS-brane]]s.
