## Idea

There are two types of [[black brane]] solutions in [[11-dimensional supergravity]], one of dimension $2+1$, one of dimension 5+1. These are thought to correspond to a fundamental 2-brane and its [[electric-magnetic duality|EM dual]], called the

* [[M2-brane]]

* [[M5-brane]]

* [[O9-plane]]

* [[M-wave]]

The M2-brane carries [[electric charge]] under the [[supergravity C-field]]. The M5-brane is the dual magnetic charge.
