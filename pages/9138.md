## Idea

In [[quantum mechanics]] a [[self-adjoint operator]] $A$ on the given [[Hilbert space]] such that its [[spectrum of an operator|spectrum]] lies between 0 and 1 is sometimes called an _effect_ or _quantum effect_ (see e.g. ([Ludwig](#Ludwig), ([Kraus](#Kraus))). These operators generalize [[projection operators]] and may be thought of as [[quantum observables]] with "unsharp" or "fuzzy" value. 

The notion of _effect algebra_ (due to ([Foulis-Bennet 94](#FoulisBennet))) is an abstraction of the structure exhibited by the collection of such effect operators.

###### Definition

A [[partial monoid|partial commutative monoid]] (PCM) consists of a set $M$ with a zero element $0 \in  M$ and a partial binary operation $\vee : M \times M \to M$ satisfying the three requirements below. They involve the notation $x \perp y$ for: $x \vee y$ is defined; in that case $x, y$ are called orthogonal.

1. Commutativity: $x\perp y$ implies $y\perp x$ and $x\vee y=y\vee x$.

1. Associativity: $y\perp z$ and $x\perp(y\vee z)$ implies $x\perp y$ and $(x\vee y)\perp z$ and $x\vee (y\vee z)=(x\vee y)\vee z$.

1. Zero: $0\perp x$ and $0\vee x=x$

###### Definition
An *effect algebra* is a PCM $(E,0,\vee)$ with an orthocomplement. The latter is a unary operation $(-)^\perp :E\to E$ satisfying:

1.  $x^\perp\in E$ is the unique element in $E$ with $x\vee x^\perp=1$, where $1=0^\perp$.

1. $x\perp 1\Rightarrow x=0$.

For such an effect algebra one defines: $x\wedge y:=(x^\perp\vee y^\perp)^\perp$ and $x\le y:\Leftrightarrow \exists_z.x\vee z=y$ and $y\ominus x=z:\Leftrightarrow y=x\vee z$
 (p. 23)

###### Remark
If we consider $(-)\ominus y:up(y)\to down(y^\perp)$ and $(-)\vee y:down(y^\perp)\to up$ as functors between [[posets]] we have [[adjunctions]]

$$((-\wedge y)\dashv (-\ominus y)\dashv (-\wedge y)$$

Hence these functors are a [[Frobenius functor|frobenius pair]].

## Examples


* [[effect algebra of predicates]]

* The real unit inteval $[0,1]$ with $\vee$ being addition of real numbers is an effect algebra since $[0,1]$ is a pcm with zero object $0$ and commutative, associative addition of real numbers and $x\perp y$ iff $x+y\le 1$. The orthocomplement of $x\in [0,1]$ is given by $\x^\perp=1-x$.
