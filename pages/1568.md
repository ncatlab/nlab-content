## Definitions

Ideals show up both in [[ring]] theory and in [[lattice]] theory.  We recall both of these below and look at some slight generalizations.


### In rings (and other rigs)

A __left ideal__ in a [[ring]] (or even [[rig]]) $R$ is a [[subset]] $I$ of (the underlying set of) $R$ such that:
*  $0 \in I$;
*  $x + y \in I$ whenever $x, y \in I$;
*  $x y \in I$ whenever $y \in I$, regardless of whether $x \in I$.

A __right ideal__ in $R$ is a subset $I$ such that:
*  $0 \in I$;
*  $x + y \in I$ whenever $x, y \in I$;
*  $x y \in I$ whenever $x \in I$.

A __two-sided ideal__ in $R$ is a subset $I$ that is both a left and right ideal; that is:
*  $0 \in I$;
*  $x + y \in I$ whenever $x \in I$ and $y \in I$;
*  $x y \in I$ whenever $x \in I$ or $y \in I$.

This generalises to:
*  $x_1 + \cdots + x_n \in I$ whenever $x_k \in I$ for every $k$;
*  $x_1 \cdots x_n \in I$ whenever $x_k \in I$ for some $k$.

Notice that all three kinds of ideal are equivalent for a commutative ring.


### In lattices (and other prosets)

An __ideal__ in a [[lattice]] (or even [[preorder|proset]]) $L$ is a [[subset]] $I$ of (the underlying set of) $L$ such that:
*  There is an element of $I$ (so that $I$ is [[inhabited set|inhabited]]);
*  if $x, y \in I$, then $x, y \leq z$ for some $z \in I$;
*  if $x \in I$ and $y \leq x$, then $y \in I$ too.

We can make this look more algebraic if $L$ is a (bounded) join-[[semilattice]]:
*  $\bot \in I$;
*  $x \vee y \in I$ if $x, y \in I$;
*  $y \in I$ whenever $x \vee y \in I$.

If $L$ is indeed a lattice, then we can make this look just like the ring version:
*  $\bot \in I$;
*  $x \vee y \in I$ whenever $x, y \in I$;
*  $x \wedge y \in I$ whenever $x \in I$.

The concept of ideal is dual to that of [[filter]].  A subset of $L$ that satisfies the first two of the three axioms for an ideal in a proset is precisely a [[direction|directed subset]] of $L$; notice that this is weaker than being a sub-join-semilattice even if $L$ is a lattice.


### In both at once

There are some common situations where these two kinds of ideal might seem to clash but fortunately do not:

* A [[distributive lattice]] is both a lattice and a commutative rig; the two concepts of ideal are the same, as can be seen by comparing the definition for rigs to the last definition for lattices.

* A [[Boolean algebra]] is a both a distributive lattice and a [[Boolean ring]]; again, the two concepts of ideal are the same (partly because the multiplication operators are the same, although there is still some checking to do regarding closure under addition).

On the other hand, every poset is a poset in an [[opposite poset|opposite]] way, and this does *not* give the same concept of ideal; an ideal in one is a [[filter]] in the opposite one.  We are lucky that the convention for interpreting a Boolean ring as a lattice goes in the correct direction, or the two notions of ideal in a Boolean algebra would not match; or perhaps it is not a matter of luck, but the convention for which way to define ideals in a lattice was chosen precisely to match the conventions for Boolean algebras!


### In monoids

There is a notion of ideal in a [[monoid]] (or even [[semigroup]]), or more generally in a [[monoid object]] in any [[monoidal category]] $C$, which generalises the notion of ideal in a ri(n)g or in a (semi)lattice.  That is, if $C$ is [[Ab]], then a monoid in $C$ is a [[ring]]; if $C$ is [[Ab Mon]], then a monoid in $C$ is a [[rig]]; and a [[semilattice]] is a commutative idempotent monoid in [[Set]].  See [[ideal in a monoid]].

This generalizes all of the above notions of ideal *except* for ideals in prosets that are not (possibly unbounded) join-semilattices.


### In categories

More generally still, passing from monoids to their many-object version there is a notion of ideal in a [[category]], called a _[[sieve]]_.  See there for details.


## Kinds of ideals

An ideal $I$ is __proper__ if there exists an element $x$ such that $x \notin I$.  In a [[rig]], $I$ is proper iff $1 \notin I$; in a (bounded) lattice, $I$ is proper iff $\top \notin I$.  If instead $x \in I$ for every $x$ (which follows if $1 \in I$ or $\top \in I$), we have the __[[improper ideal]]__.

An ideal $I$ is __prime__ if it is proper and it satsfies a binary condition corresponding to the nullary condition that is properness:
*  In a rig, $x \in I$ or $y \in I$ if $x y \in I$;
*  In a proset, $x \in I$ or $y \in I$ if, for all $z$, $z \in I$ if $z \leq x$ or $z \leq y$.
*  In a lattice (simplifying the proset version to look like the rig verison), $x \in I$ or $y \in I$ if $x \wedge y \in I$.

An ideal is a __[[maximal ideal]]__ if it is maximal among *proper* ideals.  A maximal ideal in a rig (including in a distributive lattice, but not in every lattice) is necessarily prime; a prime ideal in a Boolean algebra is necessarily maximal.

That every ideal is contained in a prime ideal is a [[prime ideal theorem]]; that every ideal is contained in a maximal ideal is a [[maximal ideal theorem]].

An ideal $I$ is __principal__ if there exists an element $x \in I$ such that $y$ is a multiple of $x$ (in a rig) or $y \leq q$ (in an ordered set) whenever $y \in I$; we say that $I$ is __generated__ by $x$.  Every element $x$ generates a unique principal ideal, the set of all multiples of $x$ (in a rig) or the [[downset]] of $x$ (in an an order).  In the noncommutative case, 'multiple' should be interpreted in a left/right sense to match that of 'ideal'.

More generally, the ideals form a [[Moore collection]] of subsets of $R$ or $L$, so we have an ideal __generated__ by any [[subset]].
