Friedman finishes by asking if this model will encourage increased risk-taking. I think the answer there depends on what you mean by risk-taking. It certainly encourages people to accept low-paying jobs with payoffs which get put into corporate shell vehicles or which don’t end up cashing out for a decade. And at the other end of the spectrum, it encourages people to take low-paying jobs which pay non-financial dividends: ski instructor, say. But in general, I don’t think that a new form of private income tax is a great way to encourage innovation. Generally, if you start taxing something, you get less of it, not more of it. And I see no reason why this model should work out any differently.has a question: would you rather own a magazine, or a digital startup? He notes that some magazines are making real money these days, including Marie Claire, even as most digital startups fail. Old Media isn’t sexy, he says, but “a lot of magazines continue to be not only damn good businesses, but are doing better than ever.”
