The appellate ruling is certainly good news for the monolines, but it’s not a certainty that Ambac and MBIA will actually get to try their case to a jury any time soon, if at all. Discovery has barely even begun — and Credit Suisse will still have a shot to eliminate the bond insurers’ cases via summary judgment motions. Those motions, by the way, will be decided by none other than Kornreich.Ever since Goldman Sachs agreed to pay $550 million to resolve claims by the Securities and Exchange Commission that it deceived investors in the Abacus collateralized debt obligation, there’s been a giant question mark hovering over the hedge fund Paulson & Co. Paulson worked with Goldman Sachs to select the CDO’s reference portfolio of mortgage-backed securities, then reaped the profits from a short position when the instrument failed. The implication was that Paulson picked securities that doomed Abacus, but the SEC never brought a case against the hedge fund. And when the bond insurer ACA Financial Guaranty, which was nominally the portfolio selection agent on the CDO, sued in 2011 to recover the $30 million it lost (plus punitive damages), it named only Goldman as a defendant.
