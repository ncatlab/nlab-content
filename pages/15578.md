## Definition

A [[topological space]]/[[simplicial set]]/[[homotopy type]]/[[infinity-groupoid]] $X$ is _nilpotent_ if the [[action]] of its [[fundamental group]] $\pi_1(X)$ on all the higher [[homotopy groups]] $\pi_n(X)$ is nilpotent, in that each $\pi_n(X)$ admits a sequence of [[subgroups]]

$$
  \ast = G_k \hookrightarrow \cdots \hookrightarrow G_1  = \pi_n(X)
$$

such that for all $i$

1. $G_{i+1} \hookrightarrow G_i$ is a [[normal subgroup]];

1. the [[quotient]] $G_i/G_{i}$ is an [[abelian group]];

1. each $G_i$ is closed under the action of $\pi_1(X)$;

1. the induced action on $G_i/G_{i+1}$ is trivial.

## Properties

Nilpotency is involved in sufficient conditions for many important constructioons in ([[stable homotopy theory|stable]]) [[homotopy theory]], see for instance at 

* [[localization of a space]];

* [[fracture theorem]].
