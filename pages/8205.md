## Idea
 {#Idea}

Beyond the speculative hypothetized role of [[string theory]] as a physical theory of [[fundamental strings]] that constitute the observed [[fundamental particles]] in the [[standard model of particle physics]], the theory has shed light on many aspects of [[quantum field theory]] as such, both on the conceptual structure of QFT as well as on concrete theories and their concrete properties such as of. This entry lists such instances of string theory results having lead to insights in non-stringy physics and in particular into experimentally confirmed physics, such as [[QCD]] in the [[standard model of particle physics]].

## Examples

The two basic theories that underlie observed fundamental physics -- and which string theory unifies at least qualitatively and in [[perturbation theory]] -- are [[Yang-Mills theory]] and [[gravity|Einstein gravity]]/[[general relativity]].

1. [Applications to Gravity](#ApplicationsToGravity)

Many of the insights are based on the gauge/gravity duality in string theory:

### Applications to Yang-Mills theory
 {#ApplicationsToYangMillsTheory}

#### Worldline formalism

The [[worldline formalism]] for expressing QFT [[scattering amplitudes]] in an effective [[gauge invariance|gauge invariant]] way (different from but equivalent to the [[Feynman rules]]) was originally found by taking the point-particle limit of the expressions for [[string scattering amplitudes]]. See at _[[worldline formalism]]_ for more.

#### QFT Duality and specifically Montonen-Olive electric/magnetic duality

By embedding quantum field theories in string theory (typically as the [[worldvolume]] theories of various [[branes]]) the various [[duality in string theory|dualities of string theory]] will relate different QFTs in ways that are typically far from obvious from just looking at these QFTs themselves. 

The investigation specifically of [[N=1 D=4 super Yang-Mills theory]] and [[N=2 D=4 super Yang-Mills theory]] in this fashion has come to be known as _[[geometric engineering of quantum field theory]]_.

[[Montonen-Olive duality]] of ([[super Yang-Mills theory|super]])  [[Yang-Mills theory]] derives from conformal invariance of the [[6d (2,0)-supersymmetric QFT]] (see there) [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|compactified]] on a [[torus]].

##### Scattering amplitudes
 {#QCDScatteringAmplitudes}

The [[string scattering amplitudes]] exhibit certain relations due to the extended nature of the string which are retained in the point particle limit and hence explain and serve to discover subtle relations in [[QFT]] [[scattering amplitudes]]. 

* [[twistor string theory]] explains some ([[N=4 D=4 super Yang-Mills theory|super]]) [[Yang-Mills theory]] [[scattering amplitudes]]

* Precision scattering amplitudes in [[QCD]] use [[twistor string theory]] [[on-shell recursion]] methods,

This also goes by the term "on-shell methods". See also at _[[amplituhedron]]_.

#### Black hole entropy

Semi-classical QFT computations suggest that there should be [[entropy]] associated with  [[black holes]], the _[[Bekenstein-Hawking entropy]]_, without however providing microscopic degrees of freedom of which this would be an entropy in the ordinary sense.

Since the quantum dynamics of general black holes is outside the reach of perturbative methods in string theory, certain [[supersymmetric black hole]] solutions in [[supergravity]] have properties independent of the coupling and are known to be the strong-coupling limit of what at weak coupling is a certain configuration of [[branes]] in flat space. Therefore the ordinary entropy of these brane configurations should match the [[Bekenstein-Hawking entropy]] of the corresponding black holes, and this has been confirmed to good precision. 

While this argument does not give direct information about the origin of the BH-entropy of physically observed black holes, it does show conceptually, in the general context of black holes in theories of gravity, BH-entropy can be accounted for by microscopic degrees of freedom in a theory of [[quantum gravity]].
