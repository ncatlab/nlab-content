## Idea

Beyond the speculative hypothetized role of [[string theory]] as a physical theory of [[fundamental strings]] that constitute the observed [[fundamental particles]] in the [[standard model of particle physics]], the theory has shed light on many aspects of [[quantum field theory]] as such, both on the conceptual structure of QFT as well as on concrete theories and their concrete properties such as of. This entry lists such instances of string theory results having lead to insights in non-stringy physics and in particular into experimentally confirmed physics, such as [[QCD]] in the [[standard model of particle physics]].

## Examples

The two basic theories that underly observed fundamental physics -- and which string theory unifies at least qualitatively and in [[perturbation theory]] -- are [[Yang-Mills theory]] and [[gravity|Einstein gravity]]/[[general relativity]]. 

1. [Applications to Yang-Mills theory](#ApplicationsToYangMillsTheory)

1. [Applications to Gravity](#ApplicationsToGravity)

Many of the insights are based on the gauge/gravity duality in string theory:

### Applications to Yang-Mills theory
 {#ApplicationsToYangMillsTheory}

#### Montonen-Olive duality

* [[Montonen-Olive duality]] of ([[super Yang-Mills theory|super]])  [[Yang-Mills theory]] derives from conformal invariance of the [[6d (2,0)-supersymmetric QFT]] (see there) [[Kaluza-Klein mechanism|compactified]] on a [[torus]].


#### To QCD and experimental particle physics

The realization of [[Yang-Mills theory]] that describes [[quarks]] and their interaction by the [[strong nuclear force]] carried by [[gluons]] is _[[quantum chromodynamics]]_ ([[QCD]]).

#### To super Yang-Mills theory

[[Seiberg duality]] in [[super Yang-Mills theory]] is conceptually explained by [[type II string theory]] on certain [[D-brane]] configurations (...)

* [[KLT relations]] ued for instance to demonstrate:

  * multi-loop finiteness of [[N=8 d=4 supergravity]]

#### Black hole entropy

Semi-classical QFT computations suggest that there should be [[entropy]] associated with  [[black holes]], the _[[Bekenstein-Hawking entropy]]_, without however providing microscopic degrees of freedom of which this would be an entropy in the ordinary sense.

Since the quantum dynamics of general black holes is outside the reach of perturbative methods in string theory, certain [[supersymmetric black hole]] solutions in [[supergravity]] have properties independent of the coupling and are known to be the strong-coupling limit of what at weak coupling is a certain configuration of [[branes]] in flat space. Therefore the ordinary entropy of these brane configurations should match the [[Bekenstein-Hawking entropy]] of the corresponding black holes, and this has been confirmed to good precision. 

While this argument does not give direct information about the origin of the BH-entropy of physically observed black holes, it does show conceptually, in the general context of black holes in theories of gravity, BH-entropy can be accounted for by microscopic degrees of freedom in a theory of [[quantum gravity]].
