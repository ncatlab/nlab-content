## Idea

The [[standard model of cosmology]], which involves an [[FRW model]] of [[spacetime]] on [[cosmology|cosmological scales]],is a solution to [[Einstein's equations]] which is undefined ("has a singularity") a finite time in the past of any co-moving observer. Since from that point on the model describes an expanding [[observable universe]] this singularity has been called the "Big Bang", especially to constrast with the _[[steady state model of cosmology]]_.
