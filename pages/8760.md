## Idea

A _vertex_ is a _[[point]]_ in a [[graph]] or [[simplicial set]] or similar. In the context of [[simplicial sets]] it is a 0-[[dimension|dimensional]] [[simplex]].

An alternative term, monosyllabic, yet unusual in contemporary graph-theory, and considered old-fashioned, is 'point'. (Cf. [Chapter 2](#HararyGraphTheory))
