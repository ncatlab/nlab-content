## Idea

A __vertex__ is a _[[point]]_ in a [[graph]] or [[simplicial set]] or similar. In the context of [[simplicial sets]] it is a 0-[[dimension|dimensional]] [[simplex]].

## Terminological remarks

Vertices are also sometimes called **points** (somewhat old-fashioned, e.g. [Harary, Chapter 2](#HararyGraphTheory)) or **nodes** (more frequently in [[computer science]]).  In specialized contexts other terms are used.  For instance, the two classes of vertices of a [[Petri net]] are called "places" or "species" and "transitions" or "reactions", respectively; and for [[quasicategories]] (particular simplicial sets) the vertices are also called [[objects]].

Historically, the use of "vertex" for a point of an abstract graph probably derives from the natural connections between [[graph theory]] and the theory of [[polyhedra]], which have "vertices".  One such connection is [[Ernst Steinitz|Steinitz's]] [[Steinitz's theorem|1916 theorem]] on the one-dimensional skeleta of [[polyhedra]] in three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]].
