## Definition

For $R$ a [[ring]], an [[associative algebra]] over $R$ is a [[ring]] $A$ equipped with a ring inclusion $R \hookrightarrow A$. If $A$ is also equipped with a ring homomorphism the other way round, 

$$
  \epsilon \colon A \to R
$$

then it is called an _augmented algebra_.

The [[kernel]] of $\epsilon$ is called the corresponding [[augmentation ideal]] in $A$.

## Examples

Every [[group algebra]] $R[G]$ is canonically augmented, the augmentation map being the operation that forms the sum of [[coefficients]] of the canonical basis elements.
