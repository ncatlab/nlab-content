A **right-admissible subcategory** (resp. left admissible subcategory) of a [[triangulated category]] $A$ is a strictly [[full]] [[triangulated subcategory]] $B$ such that the inclusion functor $i : B \hookrightarrow A$ admits a right adjoint $i^*$ (resp. a right adjoint $i_*$).  It is called simply **admissible** if it is both right- and left-admissible.
