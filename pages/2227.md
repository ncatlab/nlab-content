[[!redirects 3-place relation]]
[[!redirects ternary relation]]

A __triadic relation__ (or a __ternary relation__) is an important special case of a [[relation theory|polyadic or finitary relation]], one in which the number of places in the relation is three.  One may also see the adjectives _3-adic_, _3-ary_, _3-dimensional_, or _3-place_ being used to describe these relations.

Mathematics is positively rife with examples of 3-adic relations, and the concept of a [[sign relation]], a special case of a 3-adic relation, is fundamental to the field of semiotics, or the theory of signs.  Therefore it will be useful to consider a few concrete examples from each of these two realms.
