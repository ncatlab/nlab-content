A __ternary relation__ (or __triadic relation__) is a [[relation]] in three variables (instead of the more common two).

The elementary theory of [[category|categories]] (in the [[strict category|strict]] sense) may be defined with a single ternary relation (and several axioms) in untyped [[predicate logic]] with equality; the relation holds of [[morphisms]] $f$, $g$, and $h$ if and only if $f$ is the [[composite]] (in a fixed order) of $g$ and $h$.
