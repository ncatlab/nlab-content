A __triadic relation__ (or a __ternary relation__) is an important special case of a [[relation theory|polyadic or finitary relation]], one in which the number of places in the relation is three.  One may also see the adjectives _3-adic_, _3-ary_, _3-dimensional_, or _3-place_ being used to describe these relations.

Mathematics is positively rife with examples of 3-adic relations, and the concept of a [[sign relation]], a special case of a 3-adic relation, is fundamental to the field of semiotics, or the theory of signs.  Therefore it will be useful to consider a few concrete examples from each of these two realms.

## Examples from mathematics ##

Let $\mathbb{B} = \{ 0, 1 \}$ and let &ldquo;+&rdquo; be taken in the sense of GF(2).

For the sake of topics to be taken up later it is useful to examine a pair of 3-adic relations in tandem, $L_0$ and $L_1$, that are defined as follows:

$$L_0 = \{ (x, y, z) \in \mathbb{B}^3 : x + y + z = 0 \}.$$

$$L_1 = \{ (x, y, z) \in \mathbb{B}^3 : x + y + z = 1 \}.$$

The triples that make up the relations $L_0$ and $L_1$ are conveniently arranged in the form of relational data tables, as follows:

$$
\array{
\array{
\arrayopts{\frame{solid}\rowlines{solid solid none}}
\cellopts{\colspan{3}} L_0 = \{ (x, y, z) \in \mathbb{B}^3 : x + y + z = 0 \} \\
x & y & z \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 0  }
&
\array{
\arrayopts{\frame{solid}\rowlines{solid solid none}}
\cellopts{\colspan{3}} L_1 = \{ (x, y, z) \in \mathbb{B}^3 : x + y + z = 1 \} \\
x & y & z \\
0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 1  }
}
$$
