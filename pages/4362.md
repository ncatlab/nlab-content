This entry is about the article


* [[Dan Freed]], _Dirac charge quantization and generalized differential cohomology_ Surveys in Differential Geometry, Int. Press, Somerville, MA, 2000, pp. 129â€“194 ([arXiv:hep-th/0011220](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0011220))

This discusses how [[differential cohomology]] -- specifically [[ordinary differential cohomology]] and [[differential K-theory]] -- is the correct formalism for describing [[gauge field]]s in [[physics]] (such as [[higher U(1)-gauge fields]] like the [[electromagnetic field]], the [[Kalb-Ramond field]] and the [[supergravity C-field]], and also the [[RR-field]]) and the [[quantum anomaly]]  of  their [[action functional]]s.
