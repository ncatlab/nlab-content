* [[Dan Freed]], _Dirac charge quantization and generalized differential cohomology_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0011220))

which discusses how [[differential cohomology]] -- specifically [[Deligne cohomology]] and [[differential K-theory]] -- is the correct formalism that encodes [[gauge field]]s in physics (such as the [[electromagnetic field]], the [[Kalb-Ramond field]] and the [[RR-field]]) and their [[quantum anomaly|anomalous]] [[action functional]].
