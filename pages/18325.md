This is a synonym for [[diagonal fill-in]] morphism.

The term is used for example in:

*  R. Garner, "Homomorphisms of higher categories"
Advances in Mathematics, Volume **224** (2010),  2269--2311

It also is often used in the context of [[horn]]s in simplicial sets and related structures. For instance _`in a Kan complex, all horns have fillers'_. The two uses are, of course, closely related.
