is a commutative diagram in a category $\mathcal{C}$, then a _filler_  (synonyms:  _diagonal fill-in_ , [[lift]]) is:

* morphism $j\colon O_{0,0}\rightarrow O_{1,1}$ in $\mathcal{C}$ making both triangles created commute. 
(That is, $f_0 = h_1 j$ and $f_1 = j h_0$.)

In certain contexts, the above commutative square is called a _lifting problem_.

If $j$ is uniquely determined (in an appropriate sense), then $h_0$ is said to be _orthogonal_ to $h_1$

This concept plays an important role in homotopy theory.

The term is used in the context of [[horn]]s in simplicial sets and related structures. The term makes it possible to summarize the definition of a [[Kan complex]] in one sentence: a Kan complex is a simplicial set in which every horn has a filler.
