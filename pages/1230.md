[[Zoran Skoda]]: I like the expansion (by Mike I guess) which is now in the entry n-fibration, it is instructive and a strong novelty of the nlab (is there more to read on the weak case somewhere?). However, I would prefer that for the case of STRICT n-categories, for which I intended the fibered n category entry when I created it; that we keep the original name and original definition (thus talking about n-cartesian
cells, regardless that it is evil, and one should expand on that). Grothendieck, Gabriel and Gray discovered fibered (strict) 1- and 2- categories and called them fibered 1- or 2-categories; Hermida generalized to strict n and Bunge is following , also under the same name: so let us keep the explicit version for the strict n-categories under the name fibered n category and with "evil" definition (which is very useful in my practice, at least for n=2); and lets us keep homotopically-biased title n-fibration for the weak n-category version. Of course, no hurry, in due time...And also having an entry fibered 2-category for the case of strict 2-categories where hermida has two different but equivalent definitions. Does that make sense to you ? Mike, Toby, Urs ?

[[Toby Bartels]]:  If these are useful to you, then we should certainly have an article on them.  But can we put it at [[strict fibered n-category]]? (or [[fibered strict n-category]] if you don\'t want to imply that there\'s anything strict about how the strict $n$-category is fibred).  Besides the hyphen (which is a technicality), one of the biases of the $n$-Lab is that the default notion of $n$-category is weak.  Of course, people who work with strict $n$-categories don\'t share that bias, so we won\'t quite match their language.

[[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: I'm with Toby.  When we mean strict, we should say strict.  I don't think '$n$-fibration' is 'homotopically biased' either; plenty of people say 'fibration' rather than 'fibered category.'

The level of strictness in Hermida's definition is a bit puzzling to me.  A 2-fibration $E\to B$ in his sense corresponds to an (appropriately contravariant) functor $B\to 2Cat$, but neither to a fully strict 3-functor nor a fully weak one.  (This has nothing to do with the evilness of requiring on-the-nose cartesian lifts rather than up-to-iso ones, that is rather about strictness of the equivalence between fibrations and pseudofunctors.)  But if you think it is important, we should certainly have a page on it.
