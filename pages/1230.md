has introduced fibered 2-categories in article

* Some properties of Fib as a fibred 2-category, J. Pure Appl. Algebra 134 (1), 83-109, 1999; <a href="http://maggie.cs.queensu.ca/chermida/papers/jpaa.ps.gz">preprint version ps.gz</a>

In fact they appeared in some form also earlier in [[Gray-adjointness-for-2-categories|Gray's book]]. 

Later Hermida defined fibered (strict) $n$-categories as a 2-functor $P: E\to B$ between 2-categories such that 

* for any object $e$ in $E$ and a cell $u: b\to Pe$ in $B$, there is an $n$-cartesian 1-cell $\bar{u} : u^*e\to e$ with $P\bar{u} = u$

* for all $e,f\in E$ the $\pi$ restricted to a $(n-1)$-functor $P_{e,f}:E(e,f)\to B(Pe,Pb)$ is an $(n-1)$-fibration and for all 1-cells $w: g\to e$, the precomposition $E(w,f):E(e,f)\to E(g,f)$ preserves $n$-cartesian morphisms

This is unpublished, but it is used and presented in another joint work with <a href="http://www.math.mcgill.ca/bunge">Marta Bunge</a>, presented at CATS07 at Calais. 

One expects that the $(n+1)$-category of fibered $n$-categories is equivalent to the $(n+1)$-category of $n$-[[pseudofunctor]]s via a generalization of [[Grothendieck construction]], what is known only for $n=2$. Such $n$-pseudofunctors may be viewed (and defined) as [[anafunctor]]s. For $n$-groupoids such an approach to $n$-pseudofunctors has been studied in
