Toby I do not understand if you change the page name it is OK, but if you change it why to create now two pages and SEPARATE the history of the actual entry into another entry ?? I value the past versions and sometimes look for authorship of disputable sentences. Newcomer to a page could miss the point of preexisting versions. I prefer that new named page is just the old page with the new name and the old name is kept in a redirect. I see no sense in creating two pages out of one just for the purpose of a name. Why redirects then ? Plus I very much dislike to see in the authors list of pages I contributed to see ANY ugly long names like "that and that -- history"-- Zoran
