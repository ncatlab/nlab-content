## Idea

_Differential elliptic cohomology_ is the refinement of [[elliptic cohomology]] to [[differential cohomology]].

This may be obtained from [[differential cobordism cohomology]] by tensoring the latter with a [[Landweber exactness|Landweber exact ring]].

## References

A model for a multiplicative differential refinement of [[complex cobordism cohomology theory]], the theory represented by the [[Thom spectrum]] is in 

* [[Ulrich Bunke]], [[Thomas Schick]], Ingo Schr√∂der,  Moritz Wiethaup,  _Landweber exact formal group laws and smooth cohomology theories_ ([arXiv:0711.1134](http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.1134))

As discussed there, this model is compatible with tensoring over Landweber exact rings and hence induces in particular a notion of differential elliptic cohomology.
