###### Definition
A Frobenius algebra in a [[monoidal category]] is a quadruple $(A, \delta, \epsilon, \mu, \eta)$ such that

1. $(A, \mu, \eta)$ is a [[monoid]],
1. $(A, \delta, \epsilon)$ is a [[comonoid]], and
1. the **Frobenius laws** hold: $(1 \otimes \mu) \circ (\delta \otimes 1) = \delta \circ \mu = (\mu \otimes 1) \circ (1 \otimes \delta)$.

In terms of [[string diagram]]s, this definition says:

Frobenius algebras were originally formulated in the category [[Vect]] of [[vector space]]s with the following equivalent definition:

###### Definition

A **Frobenius algebra** is a unital, [[associative algebra]] $(A, \mu, \eta)$ equipped with a linear form $\epsilon : A \rightarrow k$ such that $\epsilon\mu$ is a non-degenerate pairing. I.e. the induced map

\[  u \mapsto \epsilon\mu(1 \otimes u) \]

is an [[isomorphism]] of $V$ with its [[dual vector space|dual space]] $V^*$. In such a case, $\epsilon$ is called a **Frobenius form**.

=--

From this definition it is easy to see that every Frobenius algebra in [[Vect]] is necessarily finite-dimensional. 

There are about a dozen equivalent definitions of a Frobenius algebra. [Ross Street (2004)](#Street2004) lists most of them.

## Types of Frobenius algebras

### Commutative Frobenius algebras ###

We can define 'commutative' Frobenius algebras in any [[symmetric monoidal category]].  Namely, a Frobenius algebra is **commutative** if its associated monoid is commutative --- or equivalently, if its associated comonoid is cocommutative.  

### Symmetric Frobenius algebras ###

We can define 'commutative' or 'symmetric' Frobenius algebras in any [[symmetric monoidal category]].  A Frobenius algebra $A$ is **symmetric** if 
$$\epsilon \circ S_{A,A} = \epsilon \, $$
where $S_{A,A} : A \otimes A \to A \otimes A$ is the symmetry.  Any commutative Frobenius algebra is symmetric, but not conversely: for example the algebra of $n \times n$ matrices with entries in a field, with its usual trace as $\epsilon$, is symmetric but not commutative when $n \gt 1$.  

A theorem of Eilenberg and Nakayama says that in the category of vector spaces over a field $k$, an algebra $A$ can be equipped with the structure of a symmetric Frobenius algebra if (but not only if) it is **separable**, meaning that for any field $K$ extending $k$, $A \otimes_k K$ is a [[semisimple algebra|semisimple]] algebra over $K$.   

### Special Frobenius algebras ###

If $\mu \circ \delta = 1$, a Frobenius algebra is said to be **special**.   In the category of vector spaces, any element $a$ of an associative unital algebra gives a left multiplication map 
$$ \array{ 
L_a : &A &\to& A \\
      &b &\mapsto& a b 
}
$$
which in turn gives a bilinear pairing $g: A \times A \to k$ defined by
$$ g(a,b) = tr(L_a L_b) $$
One can show that the algebra $A$ can be equipped with the structure of a special Frobenius algebra if and only if $g$
is nondegenerate, i.e., if there is an isomorphism $A \to A^*$ given by
$$ a \mapsto g(a, -)  $$
In this case, there is just one way to make $A$ into a special Frobenius algebra, namely by taking the counit to be 
$$ \epsilon(a) = tr(L_a) $$
(In any Frobenius algebra, the unit, multiplication and counit determine the comultiplication.)  

In fact, all the results of the previous paragraph generalize to Frobenius algebras in any symmetric monoidal category, since the proofs can be done using string diagrams.  

An associative unital algebra for which the bilinear pairing $g$ is nondegenerate is called **strongly separable**.  So, any strongly separable algebra becomes a special Frobenius algebra in a unique way.  For more details, see [[separable algebra]] and [Aguiar (2000)](#Aguiar2000).

To get a feeling for some of the concepts we are discussing, an example is helpful.  The group algebra $k[G]$ of a finite group $G$ is always separable but strongly separable if and only if the order of $G$ is invertible in the field $k$.  By the results mentioned, this means that $k[G]$ can always be made into a symmetric Frobenius algebra, but only into a special Frobenius algebra when $|G|$ is invertible in $k$.

To see this, we can check that the group algebra $k[G]$ becomes a symmetric Frobenius algebra if we define the counit $\epsilon: k[G] \to k$ to pick out the coefficient of $1 \in G$:
$$   \epsilon : \sum_{g \in G} a_g \, g \mapsto a_1 \,. $$
But when $|G|$ is invertible in $k$, we can check that $k[G]$ becomes a _special_ symmetric Frobenius algebra if we normalize the counit as follows:
$$  \epsilon : \sum_{g \in G} a_g \, g \mapsto \frac{a_1}{|G|} \, .$$

We should warn the reader that [Rosebrugh et al (2005)](#Rosebrugh2005) call a special Frobenius algebra 'separable'. This usage conflicts with the standard definition of a [[separable algebra]] in the category of vector spaces over a field, so we suggest avoiding it.

### †-Frobenius algebras ###

If a Frobenius algebra lives in a monoidal [[†-category]], $(\delta)^\dagger = \mu$ and $(\epsilon)^\dagger = \eta$, then it is said to be a **†-Frobenius algebra**. These crop up in the theory of 2d [[TQFTs]], and also in the foundations of [[quantum mechanics in terms of dagger-compact categories|quantum theory]]. 

## Properties of Frobenius algebras 

+-- {: .un_prop}
######Proposition 
A Frobenius algebra $A$ in a monoidal category is an object dual to itself. 
=-- 

+-- {: .proof}
######Proof 
Let $I$ be the monoidal unit. To say $A$ is dual to itself means there are maps $e: I \to A \otimes A$ and $p: A \otimes A \to I$ such that the usual triangular equations hold. The maps are defined by 
$$e = (I \stackrel{\eta}{\to} A \stackrel{\delta}{\to} A \otimes A), \qquad p = (A \otimes A \stackrel{\mu}{\to} A \stackrel{\epsilon}{\to} I)$$ 
and one of the triangular equations uses one of the Frobenius laws and unit and counit axioms to derive the following commutative diagram: 

$$\array{
A & \stackrel{1 \otimes \eta}{\to} & A \otimes A & \stackrel{1 \otimes \delta}{\to} & A \otimes A \otimes A \\
 & {}_1\searrow & \downarrow \mathrlap{\mu} & & \downarrow \mathrlap{\mu \otimes 1} \\
 & & A & \overset{\delta}{\to} & A \otimes A \\
 & &  & {}_{1}\searrow & \downarrow \mathrlap{\epsilon \otimes 1} \\
 & & & & A
} 
$$ 

The other triangular equation uses the other Frobenius law and unit and counit axioms. 
=-- 

As a result, we see that in the monoidal category $Mod_k$ of modules over a commutative ring $k$, Frobenius algebras $A$ considered as modules over $k$ are finitely generated and projective. This is because $A \otimes_k -$, being adjoint to itself, is a left adjoint and therefore preserves all colimits. That $A \otimes_k -$ preserves arbitrary small coproducts means $A$ is finitely generated over $k$, and that $A \otimes_k-$ preserves coequalizers means $A$ is projective over $k$. 

* Every Frobenius algebra $A$ is a [[quasi-Frobenius algebra]]: projective and injective left (right) modules over $A$ coincide. 

* Every Frobenius algebra $A$ is a [[pseudo-Frobenius algebra]]: $A$ is an injective cogenerator in the category of left (right) $A$-modules. 

## PROPs for Frobenius algebras ##

Certain kinds of Frobenius algebras have nice [[PROPs]] or [[PRO|PROs]].  The PRO for Frobenius algebras is the monoidal category of planar thick tangles, as noted by Aaron Lauda [Lauda (2006)](#Lauda2006) and illustrated here:

[[frobenius_algebra.jpg:pic]]

Lauda and Pfeiffer [Lauda (2008)](#Lauda2008) showed that the PROP for _symmetric_ Frobenius algebras is the category of 'topological open strings', since it obeys this extra axiom:

[[symmetric_frobenius_algebra_law.jpg:pic]]

The PROP for _commutative_ Frobenius algebras is [[2Cob]], as noted by many people and formally proved by Lowell Abrams [Abrams (1996)](#Abrams1996).  This means that any commutative Frobenius algebra gives a 2d [[TQFT]].  See [Kock (2006)](#Kock2006) for a history of this subject and [Kock (2004)](#Kock2004) for a detailed introduction.  In 2Cob, the circle is a Frobenius algebra.  The monoid laws look like this:

[[monoid_laws.jpg:pic]]

The comonoid laws look like this:

[[comonoid_laws.jpg:pic]]

The Frobenius laws look like this:

[[frobenius_laws.jpg:pic]]

and the commutative law looks like this:

[[commutative_law.jpg:pic]]

The PROP for _special_ commutative Frobenius algebras is Span(FinSet), as proved by Rosebrugh, Sabadini and Walters.  This is worth comparing to the PROP for commutative [[bialgebra|bialgebras]], which is Cospan(FinSet).  For details, see [Rosebrugh et al (2005)](#Rosebrugh2005), and also [Lack (2004)](#Lack2004).  

A special commutative Frobenius algebra gives a 2d TQFT that is insensitive to the genus of a 2-manifold, since in terms of pictures, the 'specialness' axioms $m \circ \delta = 1$ says that
