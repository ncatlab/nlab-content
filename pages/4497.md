In addition to the usual [[distributive laws]] between [[monad]] and a monad (in a bicategory) there are many other combinations like between monad and [[comonad]], comonad and endofunctor, action of a monoidal category and a monad and so on. The distributive laws between a monad and a comonad are called "mixed". In the bicategory of rings, bimodules and homomorphisms of bimodules, the _mixed distributive laws_ are called entwinings. In that context they were rediscovered by  [[T. Brzeziński]] and [[S. Majid]] in the context of the study of [[noncommutative principal bundles]]. Entwinings organize in a [[bicategory]]. To every entwining structure one associates the corresponding category of [[entwined module]]s.
