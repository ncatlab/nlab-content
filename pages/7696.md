Analytic spaces are [[spaces]] that are locally modeled on [[Isbell duality|formal duals]] of sub-[[associative algebra|algebras]] of [[power series]] algebras on elements with certain [[convergence]] properties with respect to given [[seminorms]].

In [[complex number|complex]] [[analytic geometry]] analytic spaces are a vast generalization of complex [[analytic manifolds]] and are usually treated in the formalism of locally ringed spaces. 

In the case of non-archimedean ground field, the topology of the affine space is totally disconnected what requires different approach than, say, over complex numbers. This leads to several variants like [[rigid analytic geometry]], [[Berkovich space]]s. Huber's adic spaces and so on.
