## Idea

For all $n \in \{-2, -1, 0,1,2,3, \cdots\}$, [[truncated object in an (infinity,1)-category|n-truncation]] is a [[modality]] (in [[homotopy type theory]]).


## Properties

### In low degree

$(-2)$-truncation is the [[unit type]] modality ([[constant map|constant]] on the unit type).

$(-1)$-truncation is given by forming _[[bracket types]]_, turning types into genuine [[propositions]]. 

[[classical logic|Classically]], this is the same as the [[double negation modality]]; in general, the bracket type ${\|A\|_{-1}}$ only entails the double negation $\neg(\neg{A})$:
there is a canonical [[function]]

$$
  {\|A\|_{-1}} \longrightarrow \neg(\neg{A})
$$

and this is a [[1-epimorphism]] precisely if the [[law of excluded middle]] holds.

### Relation to higher inductive types

$n$-truncation is given by a [[higher inductive type]].
