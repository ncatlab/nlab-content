A locally contractible space can be defined in one of two ways. Let $X$ be a topological space.

* $X$ is _locally relatively contractible_ if it has a basis of open sets $U$ such that the inclusions $U \to X$ are [[null-homotopic map|null-homotopic]].

* $X$ is _locally contractible_ if it has a basis of open sets $U$ such that the spaces $U$ are contractible.

The second definition obviously implies the first.

One could also consider a basis of open sets such that the opens $U$ have trivial homotopy groups, but this does not seem to crop up in practice.

#### Examples ####

* Any CW complex is locally contractible.

* Any ideas for a locally relatively contractible space that is not locally contractible?

#### Other viewpoints ####

If one considers fundamental $\infty$-groupoids, the inclusion $U\to X$ being null-homotopic is equivalent to the induced $\infty$-functor being naturally isomorphic to the trivial functor sending everything to a single point.

[[David Roberts]]: The following may be straightforwardly obvious, but I have couched it as a conjecture, because I haven't seen it in print.

**Conjecture:** This condition (local relative contractibility) is sufficient to ensure that every locally constant $n$-stack is locally trivial.
