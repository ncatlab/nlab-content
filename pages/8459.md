## Idea

Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an [[abelian category]] and write $Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A})$ for its [[category of chain complexes]]. Under forming [[chain homology]]

$$
  H_0 : Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A}) \to \mathcal{A}
$$

in some (any) fixed degree, a [[homotopy fiber sequence]] in $Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A})$ is sent to a [[long exact sequence]] in $\mathcal{A}$. This is the _homology long exact sequence_. 

Often this is considered specifically for the case that the fiber sequence in $Ch_\bullet(\mathcal{A})$ is that induced from a [[short exact sequence]] in $\mathcal{A}$. In this case the further map (that which makes the sequence "long") is called the [[connecting homomorphism]].

## Statement

(...)

For the moment see still at _[[fiber sequence]]_, for instance the section
_[long exact sequence in cohomology](fiber%20sequence#LongSequCoh)_ there.
