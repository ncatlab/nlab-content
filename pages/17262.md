## Idea

The _quaternion group_ of [[order of a group|order]] 8, $Q_8$, is the [[finite subgroup of SU(2)]] $Q_8 \subset SU(2) \simeq S^3 \subset \mathbb{H}$ of unit [[quaternions]] which consists of the canonical four [[linear basis|basis]]-quaternions and their negatives:

$$
  Q_8
  \;=\;
  \big\{
     \pm 1,
     \, 
     \pm i
     \, 
     \pm j
     \, 
     \pm k
  \big\}
  \,.
$$

This is [[isomorphic|isomorphic]] to the [[binary dihedral group]] of the same [[order of a group|order]] $Q_8 \simeq 2 D_4$. As such, the [[Dynkin diagram]] that corresponds to $Q_8$ under the [[ADE-classification]] of [[finite subgroups of SU(2)]] is [[D4]], the [[triality]]-invariant one.

This order-8 quaternion group $Q_8$ is the first in a row of [[generalized quaternion groups]], $Q_{4n}$, which are also examples of  [[dicyclic groups]] which class forms  part of an even larger family.

## Definition

The _generalised quaternion group_ of order $4n$, $n\geq 2$, is the [[group]] $Q_{4n}$ defined by the presentation $\langle x,y | x^{2n}= x^{n} y^{-2}=y^{-1}x y x=1\rangle$. The _quaternion group_ (of order 8) is $Q_{4n}$ for $n=2$.

## Properties

* $Q_{4n}$ is (isomorphic to) a finite subgroup of $\mathbb{H}^\ast$ as can be seen by taking generators $x=j$ and $y=\cos(\pi/n) + i\sin(\pi/n)$. For $n=2$ this simply yields the subgroup generated by $i$ and $j$.

* $Q_{4n}$ has another presentation as $\langle R, S, T | R^2=S^2=T^n=R S T\rangle$. $R S T$ as a power of each of the generators is central and $Q_{4n}/\langle R S T\rangle= D_{2n}$, where $D_{2n}=\langle R, S, T | R^2=S^2=T^n=R S T=1\rangle$ is the [[dihedral group]] of order $2n$.

* {#HamiltonianGroup} $Q_8$ is a **Hamiltonian group** i.e. a [[non-abelian group]] such that every [[subgroup]] is [[normal subgroup|normal]]. Moreover, a general structure theorem for Hamiltonian groups by Baer (1933) says that every Hamiltonian group has a [[direct product group]]-decomposition containing $Q_8$ as a factor hence, in particular, every Hamiltonian group contains $Q_8$ as a [[subgroup]]! (cf. [Scott (1987, p.253](#Scott87)))

* $Q_8$ is the multiplicative part of the quaternionic near-field $J_9$. (cf. [Weibel (2007)](#Weibel07))

###### Proposition
**(inclusion of $Q_8$ into [[finite subgroups of SU(2)]])**

Among the [[finite subgroups of SU(2)]] (hence among all "finite quaternion groups") the quaternion group of [[order of a group|order]] 8, $Q_8$ is a proper [[subgroup]] precisely of the three [[ADE-classification|exceptional cases]]:

  * $Q_8 \subset 2 T$ the [[binary tetrahedral group]] ([[normal subgroup|normal]]),

  * $Q_8 \subset 2 O$ the [[binary octahedral group]] (not [[normal subgroup|normal]])

  * $Q_8 \subset 2 I$ the [[binary icosahedral group]] (not [[normal subgroup|normal]])

### An elementary derivation of a presentation of $Q_8$ from a description in terms of matrices.

There are lots of different ways of defining $Q:=Q_8$. One is that it is the subgroup of $Gl(2,\mathbb{C})$ generated by the matrices 

$$\xi = \left(\array{i&0\\0&-i}\right)$$

and 

$$\eta =\left(\array{0&-1\\1&0}\right).$$ 

In this form it is a nice exercise to derive a presentation of $Q_8$.  Clearly $\xi^4=1$ and $\eta$ is not in $ \langle \xi\rangle$ as is easiy checked, so the order of this group must be at least 8.  

We note that $\eta^2 = \xi^2$ and that $\eta \xi \eta^{-1}= \xi^{-1}$, so a guess for a presentation  would be

$$
\langle x,y : x^4=1, y^2=x^2, y x y^{-1}=x^{-1}\rangle.
$$

Let us call $G$ the group presented by this presentation, then there is an obvious epimorphism from $G$ to $Q$ sending $x$ to $\xi$ and $y$ to $\eta$. This is an isomorphism as will be clear if we show that the order of $G$ is less than of equal to 8.  Now every element of $G$ can be written in the form $x^i y^j$ with $0\leq i\leq 3$ and $0\leq j\leq 1$, since $y x=x^{-1}y$ so powers of $y$ can be shifted to the right in any expression and then if the resulting power of $y$ is greater than 2 we can use $y^2=x^2$ to replace even powers of $y$ by powers of $x$. We must therefore have that the group $G$ must contain a most 8 elements so the above presentation is a presentation of $Q_8$.
