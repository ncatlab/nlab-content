## Idea

The **quaternion group** (of order 8)  is the multiplicative group $Q_8$ consisting of the four base [[quaternions]] $1, i, j, k$ plus their additive inverses whose defining relations $i^2=j^2=k^2=ijk=-1$ were inscribed by [[William Rowan Hamilton|Sir William Hamilton]] on Brougham Bridge, Dublin on October 16th, 1843 while taking a walk with his wife.

The quaternion group $Q_8$ is the first in a row of _generalized quaternion groups_ $Q_{4n}$ , also called **dicyclic groups** which in turn are part of an even larger family.

## Definition

The _dicyclic group_ of order $4n$, $n\geq 2$, is the [[group]] $Q_{4n}$ defined by the presentation $\langle x,y | x^{2n}= x^{n} y^{-2}=y^{-1}xyx=1\rangle$. The _quaternion group_ (of order 8) is $Q_{4n}$ for $n=2$.

## Properties

* $Q_{4n}$ is (isomorphic to) a finite subgroup of the group of unit quaternions as can be seen by taking generators $x=j$ and $y=\cos(\pi/n) + i\sin(\pi/n)$. For $n=2$ this simply yields the subgroup generated by $i$ and $j$.

* $Q_{4n}$ has another presentation as $\langle R, S, T | R^2=S^2=T^n=RST\rangle$. $RST$ as a power of each of the generators is central and $Q_{4n}/\langle RST\rangle= D_{2n}$, where $D_{2n}=\langle R, S, T | R^2=S^2=T^n=RST=1\rangle$ is the [[dihedral group]] of order $2n$.

* $Q_8$ is a **Hamiltonian group** i.e. a non-Abelian group such that every subgroup is normal. Moreover, a result by Baer (1933) says that _every_  Hamiltonian group contains a copy of $Q_8$ ! (cf [Scott (1987, p.253](#Scott87))
