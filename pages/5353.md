###### Definition

An **étale cover** of an algebraic [[scheme]] $X$ is a set 
$\{p_i : U_i \to X\}$ of [[étale morphism]]s locally of finite type
which are jointly surjective in the sense that $X$ equals the union of
set-theoretic images:

$$
  X = \union_i p_i(U_i).
$$

Remark: locally of finite type is just strengthening the variant of the 
notion of etale: in the case of non-Noetherian schemes Grothendieck requires instead that etale morphisms be locally of finite presentation; for the purpose of etale topology the locally of finite type is required. 

The [[étale site]] has [[covering]]s given by the étale covers.

## Properties

###### Proposition

Every étale cover is a [[cover]] in the [[fpqc topology]].

This appears for instance as ([de Jong, lemma 3.3](#deJong)).
