A [[simplicial space]] X such that X<sub>0</sub> (the set of points) is a discrete [[simplicial set]] and the [[Segal map]]

φ<sub>k</sub> : X<sub>k</sub> &rarr; X<sub>1</sub> &times; <sub> X <sub>0</sub></sub> ... &times; <sub> X <sub>0</sub></sub>X<sub>1</sub> (induced by X(α<sub>i</sub>):X<sub>k</sub> &rarr; X<sub>1</sub>) assigned to X is a weak equivalence of simplicial sets for k≥2.

Segal categories are one model for $(\infty,1)$-[[(infinity,1)-category|categories]].

Segal categories are a weak form of [[S-category|S-categories]], in which composition is only defined up to a coherent system of equivalences.

Segal categories were defined 1974 implicitly by [[Graeme Segal]]. They were named Segal categories first by William Dwyer-[[Daniel Kan]]-Jeffrey Smith 1989. In their famous book Homotopy invariant algebraic structures on topological spaces John Boardman and Rainer Vogt called them [[quasi-category|quasi-categories]]. A quasi-category is a simplicial set satisfying the weak Kan condition, so quasi-categories are also called [[weak Kan complex]]es.
