## Idea

The notion of _Segal category_ is one of the models for that of _[[(∞,1)-category]]_. 

It can be understood as modelling the notion of an [[sSet]]-[[enriched category|enrichment]] _up to [[coherence|coherent]] [[homotopy]]_, i.e. a _weak_ enrichment. As such it is very similar to the notion of [[complete Segal space]], which models the notion of an [[internal category in an (∞,1)-category|internal category]] in [[sSet]].

Indeed, Segal categories may be considered with enrichment not just over [[sSet]], but over other suitable [[model categories]]. In particular, an itereated enrichment over itself gives rise to the notion of _[[Segal n-category]]_ which is a model for _[[(∞,n)-categories]]_.

Since the major difference between ([[small category|small]])
$\mathcal{V}$-[[enriched categories]] and $\mathcal{V}$-[[internal categories]] is that in the first case the [[objects]] (as opposed to all the [[hom objects]]) form an ordinary [[set]], while in the second these form an object of $\mathcal{V}$, too, accordingly a the definition of _Segal category_ is like that of _([[complete Segal space|complete]]) [[Segal space]]_, only that the simplicial set of objects is required to be an ordinary set (a [[discrete object|discrete]] simplicial set).

## Definition

+-- {: .num_def}
###### Definition

A **Segal category** is 

* a [[simplicial object|simplicial]] [[simplicial set]] ($\simeq$ [[bisimplicial set]]) $X \in [\Delta^{op}, sSet]$, 

  where we call $X_0$ the _simplicial set of [[objects]]_, $X_1$ the _simplicial set of [[morphisms]]_;  and $X_k$ for $k \geq 2$ the _simplicial set of sequences of composable morphisms of length $k$_;

* such that $X_0$ is a [[discrete object|discrete]] (= constant) simplicial set;

* and such that the morphisms

  $$ 
    X^{Sp[k] \hookrightarrow \Delta[k]}
     :
     X_k 
       \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}    
     X_1 \times_{X_0} \cdots \times_{X_0} X_1 \;\;(k factors)
  $$

  induced by the [[spine]] inclusions $Sp[k] \hookrightarrow \Delta[k]$ are [[model structure on simplicial sets|weak equivalences of simplicial sets]] for $k \geq 2$.

###### Remark

There is _no_ condition that a Segal category be [[fibrant object|fibrant]] with respect to the [[Reedy model structure]] on bisimplicial sets.

###### Remark

For $X$ a Segal category, the [[fiber product]] simplicial set $X_1 \times_{X_0} X_1$ is manifestly the space of pairs of composable 1-[[morphism]]s in $X$, and the [[weak equivalence]] 

$$
  (d_0,d_2) 
    :  
  X_2 \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} X_1 \times_{X_0} X_1 
$$ 

given by the above definition together with the remaining face map $d_1 : X_2 \to X_1$ constitutes an [[∞-anafunctor]]

$$
  \circ : X_1 \times_{X_0} X_1 &#x21F8; X_1
$$

given by the [[span]]

$$
  \array{
    X_2 &\stackrel{d_1}{\to}& X_1
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\simeq}}\downarrow
    \\
    X_1 \times_{X_0} X_1
  }
  \,.
$$

This encodes the [[composition]] operation in the Segal category $X$. 

Accordingly, the analogous spans out of $X_k$ for $k \geq 3$ encode the [[associativity]] of this composition as well as all its [[coherence|coherences]].

## Properties

### Model category structure

The category of [[bisimplicial sets]] carries a [[model category]] structure whose [[fibrant objects]] are the Segal categories. This _[[model structure for Segal categories]]_ is a [[presentable (∞,1)-category|presentation]] of the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-categories]].

### Operadic version

The [[operad|operadic]] generalization of Segal category is that of _[[Segal operad]]_. Segal categories are precisely those Segal operads whose only [[inhabited set|inhabited]] operations-spaces are those of unary operations.

## Examples

### Inclusion of ordinary categories

Let $C$ be an ordinary [[small category]] and write $N(C) \in sSet$ for its [[nerve]]. Regard this as a bisimplicial set under the inclusion $sSet \simeq [\Delta^{op}, Set] \hookrightarrow [\Delta^{op}, sSet]$. 
 
Then $N(C)$ is a Segal category. Each simplicial set $N(C)_k$ is discrete, for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$, and all the morphisms

$$
  N(C)_k \to Mor(C) \times_{Obj(C)} \cdots \times_{Obj(C)} Mor(C)
$$

are in fact [[isomorphisms]] / [[bijections]] of sets. This property of the [[nerve]] of an ordinary category goes by the name _Segal condition_ and is what gave Segal categories its name.
