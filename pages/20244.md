## Idea

A [[group action]] is _effective_ if only the [[neutral element]] acts [[trivial action|trivially]] on _all_ elements.

## Definition

A [[group action]] of a [[group]] ([[group object]]) $G$ on a  [[set]] ([[object]]) $X$ is _effective_ if $\underset{x \in X}{\forall} g x = x$ implies that $g = e$ is the [[neutral element]].

Beware the similarity to and difference with [[free action]]: a free action is effective, but an effective action need not be free.
