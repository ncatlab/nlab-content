A **Boolean category** is a [[coherent category]] (such as a topos) in which every [[subobject]] has a complement, i.e., for any monic $A\hookrightarrow X$ there is a monic $B\hookrightarrow X$ such that $A\cap B$ is initial and $A\cup B = X$.  Therefore, the lattice $Sub(X)$ of subobjects of any object $X$ is a [[Boolean algebra]].

Any Boolean category is, in particular, a [[Heyting category]] and therefore supports a full [[first-order logic|first-order]] [[internal logic]].  However, unlike that of an arbitrary Heyting category, the internal logic of a Boolean category satisfies the principle of [[excluded middle]]; it is first-order [[classical logic]].
