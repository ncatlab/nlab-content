## Definition

A **Boolean category** is a [[coherent category]] (such as a [[topos]]) in which every [[subobject]] has a complement, i.e., for any [[monomorphism]] $A\hookrightarrow X$ there is a monomorphism $B\hookrightarrow X$ such that $A\cap B$ is [[initial object|initial]] and $A\cup B = X$.  Therefore, the [[subobject lattice]] $Sub(X)$ of any [[object]] $X$ is a [[Boolean algebra]].

## Properties

Any Boolean category is, in particular, a [[Heyting category]] and therefore supports a full [[first-order logic|first-order]] [[internal logic]].  However, unlike that of an arbitrary Heyting category, the internal logic of a Boolean category satisfies the principle of [[excluded middle]]; it is [[first-order logic|first-order]] [[classical logic]].
