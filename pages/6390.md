## Idea

The _spinning relativistic particle_ is a variant of the plain [[relativistic particle]] which has an "internal degree of freedom" called [[spin]]: it is a _[[spinor]]_ , a [[fermion]]. Examples that appear in the [[standard model of particle physics]] are [[electron]]s, and [[quarks]].

As a 1-dimensional [[sigma-model]], the _spinning_ relativistic particle is like the [[relativistic particle]] but with [[fermion field]]s on the [[worldline]]. This worldline action always happens to have worldline [[supersymmetry]], entirely independent of whether there is any supersymmetry on [[target space|target]] [[spacetime]].


## Properties

### Worldline supersymmetry
 {#WorldlineSupersymmetry}

we discuss how spinning particles automatically have [[supersymmetry]] in their [[worldline formalism]]. See the [references below](#WorldlineSupersymmtryReferences) for more. For more on this see also at [string theory FAQ -- Does string theory predict supersymmetry?](string+theory+FAQ#DoesSTPredictSupersymmetry).

In the [[Polyakov action]]-formulation the [[action functional]] of the [[relativistic particle]] [[sigma model]] on the 1-dimensional [[worldline]] is actually 1-dimensional [[gravity]] coupled to "worldline matter fields", where the latter are the embedding fields $\phi : \mathbb{R} \to X$ into the [[target space]].

It turns out that the generalization of this 1-dimensional gravity action to [[supergravity]] yields the action functional that describes ordinary Dirac [[spinors]] -- spinning particles like [[electron]]s -- propagating on [[target space]] $X$. See the [references on worldline supersymmetry](#WorldlineSupersymmtryReferences) below.

The worldline supersymmetry of fermions comes down to the fact that their [[Hamiltonian]](-constraint) operator $H$ has a square root: the 
[[Dirac operator]] $D$. Its defining equations

$$
  [D,D] = 2 D^2 = H\,,\;\;\; [H,H] = 0\;,\;\; [D,H] = 0
$$

characterize the $d = 1$ [[translation super-Lie algebra]].


For appreciating this fact it is important to keep the ingredients of [[sigma-model]] theory sorted out correctly: a supersymmetric theory on the worldline describes a spinning particle on some [[target space|spacetime]] coupled to some [[background gauge field]]s. That background geometry need not have a "global supersymmetry" (a covariant constant spinor), hence under [[second quantization]] the [[perturbation theory]] _on target space_ induced by the worldline theory need not have any global supersymmetries (in particular no superpartners to the effective particle excitations). What will happen, though, is that the full target space theory induced under [[second quantization]] will be a [[supergravity]] theory on target space. Some of its solutions may have covariantly constant spinors (and hence global supersymmetry), but generically they will not, just like the generic solution to ordinary [[Einstein equations]] does not have a [[Killing vector]].

## History

That some [[particle]]s have a property called [[spinor|spin]] was found in 1922 in the [[Stern-Gerlach experiment]].
