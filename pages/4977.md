## Idea

 A [[regular monomorphism]] in a [[category]] is a morphism that is the [[equalizer]] of any pair of morphisms. A _regular monomorphism in an $(\infty,1)$-category_ is the analog of this in [[(∞,1)-category theory]].


## Definition

Let $C$ be an [[(∞,1)-category]]. A [[morphism]] $f : x \to y$ in $C$ is a **regular monomorphism** if there exists a [[cosimplicial object|cosimplicial]] [[diagram]] $D : \Delta \to C$ with $D[0] = y$ such that $f$ is the [[(∞,1)-limit]] over this diagram.

$$
  x \stackrel{f}{\to} y \stackrel{\to}{\to} y_1 \stackrel{\to}{\stackrel{\to}{\to}} y_2 \cdots
$$
