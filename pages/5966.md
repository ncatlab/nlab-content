Given a [[topologizing subcategory]] $\mathbb{T}$ of an abelian category $A$, the $n$-th neighborhood of $\mathbb{T}$ is the $n$-th power $\mathbb{T}^{(n)}$ of $\mathbb{T}$ with respect to the [[Gabriel multiplication]] of topologizing subcategories. 

The union $\mathbb{T}^{(\infty)} := \cup_{n\gt 1} \mathbb{T}^{(n)}$ is a topologizing subcategory of $A$ closed under extensions (that is a [[thick subcategory]] in the strong sense).  

A typical example is when $\mathbb{T} = \Delta_B$ is the minimal "subscheme" (= coreflective [[topologizing subcategory]]) of the category of additive endofunctors $A = End B$ containing the identity functor. See [[differential monad]].
