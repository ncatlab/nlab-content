## Idea

The notion of _continuous category_ is a [[categorification]] of the notion of _[[continuous poset]]_.

## Definition

Let $C$ be a [[category]] and $Ind(C)$ its category of [[ind-objects]].  We assume that $C$ has [[filtered colimits]], which is equivalently to say that the restricted [[Yoneda embedding]] $\hat{(-)} : C\to Ind(C)$ has a [[left adjoint]] $\colim$.

###### Definition
A category $C$ with filtered colimits is a **continuous category** if $\colim: Ind(C) \to C$ has a left adjoint.
=--

If $C$ is a [[poset]], then $Ind(C) = Idl(C)$ is its category of [[ideals]].  Thus, a poset is a continuous category exactly when it is a [[continuous poset]].

## Examples

* Any [[locally finitely presentable category]] is a continuous category.

* A [[Grothendieck topos]] is a continuous category if and only if it is an [[exponentiable object]] in the 2-category of toposes.

  * If $X$ is a [[stably locally compact locale]] (or more generally a [[metastably locally compact locale]]), then $Sh(X)$ is continuous and hence exponentiable.  It does *not* suffice for $X$ to be locally compact (i.e. for its [[frame]] $O(X)$ of opens to be a continuous poset).

## Wavy arrows

If $C$ is continuous, with $L:C\to Ind(C)$ the left adjoint of $\colim$, and $x,y\in C$, we define a **wavy arrow** $x\rightsquigarrow y$ to be a morphism $\hat{x} \to L(y)$ in $Ind(C)$.  This is a categorification of the [[way-below relation]] on a continuous poset: when $C$ is a poset we have a wavy arrow $x\rightsquigarrow y$ just when $x\ll y$.  But unlike in the posetal case, it is not clear how to define wavy arrows unless $C$ is continuous (whereas $\ll$ can be defined in any poset with directed joins).  However, see [[totally distributive category]].

Since $\colim \hat{x} = x$ and $\colim L(y)=y$, the functor $\colim$ assigns to every wavy arrow a "straight" arrow $x\to y$ in $C$.  Moreover, wavy arrows can be composed: the composite of $f:\hat{x} \to L(y)$ and $g:\hat{y} \to L(z)$ is the composite
$$ \hat{x} \xrightarrow{f} L(y) \xrightarrow{i} \hat{y} \xrightarrow{g} L(z) $$
where $i$ is the [[adjunct]] of the identity $y = \colim \hat{y}$ (or of the identity $\colim L(y) = y$).  This composition is associative.  Thus, we _almost_ have a category whose objects are those of $C$ and whose morphism are wavy arrows --- but it does not have identities.

However, if $\tilde{C}(x,y)$ denotes the set of wavy arrows, then the composition defines a map of [[profunctors]] $\tilde{C} \otimes_C \tilde{C} \to \tilde{C}$ which is in fact an isomorphism.  Combined with the map from wavy arrows to straight ones, this makes $\tilde{C}$ into an idempotent [[comonad]] on $C$ in the bicategory [[Prof]].
