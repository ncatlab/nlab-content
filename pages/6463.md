## Definition

A bisimplicial set is a bisimplicial object in [[Set]].


## Properties

### Diagonal

+-- {: .un_def }
###### Definition
**(diagonal)**

For $X_{\bullet,\bullet}$ a bisimplicial set, its **diagonal** is the simplicial set that this the precomposition with $(Id, Id) : \Delta^{op} \to \Delta^{op} \times \Delta^{op}$, i.e. the simplicial set with components.

$$
  d(X)_n = X_{n,n}
  \,.
$$

=--


+-- {: .un_def }
###### Definition
**(realization)**

The **realization** $|X|$ of a bisimplicial set $X_{\bullet,\bullet}$ is the [[simplicial set]] that is given by the [[coend]]

$$
  |X| =  \int^{[n] \in \Delta} X_{n,\bullet} \times \Delta[n]_\bullet
$$

in [[sSet]].

=--

+-- {: .un_prop }
###### Proposition
**(diagonal is realization)**

For $X$ a bisimplicial set, its diagonal $d(X)$ is (isomorphic to) its realization $|X|$:

$$
  |X| \simeq d(X)
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

This is exercise 1.6 in  in [chapter 4](http://www.maths.abdn.ac.uk/~bensondj/papers/g/goerss-jardine/ch-4.dvi) of 

* Goerss-Jardine, _Simplicial Homotopy Theory_ ([dvi](http://www.maths.abdn.ac.uk/~bensondj/html/archive/goerss-jardine.html)) 


=--

+-- {: .un_prop }
###### Proposition
**(diagonal is homotopy colimit)**

The diagonal of a bisimplicial set $X_{\bullet,\bullet}$ is also (up to weak equivalence) the [[homotopy colimit]] of $X$ regarded as a simpliciall diagram in the [[model structure on simplicial sets]]

$$  
  diag X \simeq hocolim (X : \Delta^{op} \to sSet_{Quillen})
  \,.
$$

=--

This appears for instance as theorem 3.6 in ([Isaacson](#Isaacson)).

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

This follows with the above equivalence to the [[coend]] $diag X \simeq \int^{[k] \in \Delta} \Delta[k] \cdot X_k$ and general expression of  [[homotopy colimit]]s by coends (as discussed there) in terms of the [[Quillen bifunctor]]

$$
  \int^\Delta (-) \cdot (-)
    :
   [\Delta, sSet_{Quillen}]_{Reedy} \times
   [\Delta, sSet_{Quillen}]_{Reedy}  
  \to 
    sSet_{Quillen}
$$

in [[Reedy model structure]]s (as discussed there) by using that $\Delta[-] : \Delta \to sSet_{Quillen}$ is a Reedy cofibrant resultion of the point in $[\Delta, sSet_{Quillen}]$ and that every object in $[\Delta^{op}, sSet_{Quillen}]_{Reedy}$ is cofibrant.
=--

+-- {: .un_prop }
###### Proposition
**(degreewise weak equivalences)**

Let $X,Y : \Delta^{op} \times \Delta^{op} \to Set$ be bisimplicial sets.
A morphism $f : X \to Y$ which is degreewise in one argument a weak equivalence
$f_{n,\bullet} : X(n,\bullet) \to Y(n,\bullet)$ induces a weak equivalence 
$d(f) : d(X) \to d(Y)$ of the associated diagonal simplicial sets
(with respect to the standard [[model structure on simplicial sets]]).

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

This is prop 1.9 in [chapter 4](http://www.maths.abdn.ac.uk/~bensondj/papers/g/goerss-jardine/ch-4.dvi) of 

* Goerss-Jardine, _Simplicial Homotopy Theory_ ([dvi](http://www.maths.abdn.ac.uk/~bensondj/html/archive/goerss-jardine.html))

### Total d&eacute;calage and total simplicial sets

There is a [[functor]] called _ordinal sum_ (discussed at [[simplicial category]])

$$
  + : \Delta^\op \times \Delta^{op} \to \Delta^{op}
  \,.
$$

$$
  + : [k], [l] \mapsto [k+l+1]
  \,.
$$

This induces an [[adjoint triple]]

$$
  ssSet
   \stackrel{\overset{+_!}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{+^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{+_*}{\to}}}
  sSet
  \,.
$$

Here 

* $T := +_*$ is called the **total simplicial set** functor or [[codiagonal]];

* $Dec := +^*$ is called the [[total decalage]] functor;


$T$ preserves degreewise [[weak equivalences]] of [[simplicial sets]].

For $X$ any bisimplicial set 

* the canonical morphism
 
  $$
    diag X \to T X
  $$

  from the [[diagonal]] to the total simplcial set is a weak equivalence in the [[model structure on simplicial sets]];

* the [[unit of an adjunction|adjunction unit]]

  $$
    X \to T Dec X
  $$

  is a weak equivalence.



These statements are for instance in ([CegarraRemedios](#CegarraRemedios)).

After [[geometric realization]] these spaces are even related by a [[homeomorphism]]! (This seems to be due to Berger and Hübschmann, but related results were known to Zisman as they are so mentioned by Cordier in his work on homotopy limits.)

Notice that the standard [[delooping]] functor for [[simplicial group]]s

$$
  \bar W : sGrp \to sSet_*
$$

is the composite

$$
  \bar W 
   : 
  sGrpd
   \stackrel{B}{\to}
  sGrpd
   \stackrel{N}{\to}
  ssSet
   \stackrel{T}{\to}
  sSet
  \,.
$$

We have the following explicit formula for $ T X$, attributed to [[John Duskin]]:

+-- {: .num_lemma }
###### Lemma

For $X$ a [[bisimplicial set]] the total simplicial set 
$T X$ is in degree $n$ the [[equalizer]]

$$
  (T X)_n 
  \to
  \prod_{i = 0}^n X_{i, n-i}
  \stackrel{\to}{\to}
  \prod_{i = 0}^{n-1}
  X_{i, n-i-1}
$$

where the components of the two morphisms on the right are

$$
  \prod_{i = 0}^n X_{i,n-i}
   \stackrel{p_i}{\to}
  X_{i, n-i}
 \stackrel{d_0^v}{\to}
  X_{i, n-i-1}
$$

and

$$
 \prod_{i = 0}^n X_{i,n-i}
  \stackrel{p_{i+1}}{\to}
  X_{i+1,n-i-1}
  \stackrel{d_{i+1}^h}{\to}
  X_{i,n-i-1}
 \,.
$$

The face maps $d_i : (T X)_n \to (T X)_{n-1}$
are given by

$$
  d_i 
    =
  (d_i^v p_0, 
   d_{i-1}^v p_1,
   \cdots,
   d_1^v p_{i-1},
   d_i^h p_{i+1},
   d_i^h p_{i+2},
   \cdots,
   d_i^h p_n
  )
$$

and the degeneracy maps are given by

$$
  s_i 
  =
  (s_i^v p_0, s_{i-1}^v p_1, \cdots, 
   s_0^v p_i, s_i^h p_{i+1}, \cdots, 
   s_i^h p_n)
  \,.
$$

The $(Dec \dashv T)$-[[unit of an adjunction|adjunction unit]] $\eta : X \to T Dec X$ is given in degree $n$ by

$$
  \eta : x \mapsto 
   (s_0(x), s_1(x), \cdots, s_n(x))
  \,.
$$

### Geometric realization

See [[geometric realization of simplicial topological spaces]].

## Model structures

There are various useful [[model category]] structures on the category of bisimplicial sets.

### Induced from the diagonal

There is an [[adjunction]]

$$
  (L \dashv diag)   : 
  ssSet
  \stackrel{\overset{L}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{diag}{\to}}
  sSet 
  \,.
$$

The [[transferred model structure]] along this adjunction of the standard [[model structure on simplicial sets]] exists and with respect to it the above [[Quillen adjunction]] is a [[Quillen equivalence]].

This is due to ([Moerdijk 89](#Moerdijk)

### Induced from codiagonal $\nabla$.

The [[transferred model structure]] on $ssSet$ along the total simplicial set functor $T$ exists. And for it 

$$
  (Dec \dashv T) : ssSet 
    \stackrel{\overset{Dec}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{T}{\to}}
   sSet
$$ 

is a [[Quillen equivalence]].


+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

Every diag-fibration is also a $T$-fibration.

=--

This is ([CegarraRemedios, theorem 9](#CegarraRemedios)).

#### Remark on notation

There are two uses of $\bar W$ in this area, one is as used in ([CegarraRemedios](#CegarraRemedios)) where it is used for the codiagonal, that has been written $\nabla$ above, the other is for the classifying space functor for a [[simplicial group]] and this latter is not only the older of the two uses by also comes with a related $W$ construction.  The relationship between the two is that given a simplicial group or simplicially enriched groupoid, $G$, applying the [[nerve]] functor in each dimension gives a bisimplicial set and $\bar{W}G = \nabla Ner G$. Because of this, some care is needed when using these sources.

###### Proposition

Let $A,B : \Delta^{op} \times \Delta^{op} \to Ab$ be bisimplicial abelian groups.
A morphism $f : A \to B$ which is degreewise in one argument a weak equivalence
$f_{n,\bullet} : A(n,\bullet) \to B(n,\bullet)$ induces a weak equivalence 
$d(f) : d(A) \to d(B)$ of the associated diagonal complexes.
