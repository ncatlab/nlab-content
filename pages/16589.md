
The __trivial subalgebra__ of an [[gebra|algebra]] $A$ is the smallest [[subalgebra]] of $A$, the [[intersection]] of all subalgebras of $A$ (assuming that this is a subalgebra, otherwise there is no trivial subalgebra).  In the context of [[universal algebra]], this is the __empty subalgebra__ ---the [[empty subset]] of the [[underlying set]] of $A$--- if there are no constant ($0$-ary) operations; more generally, it\'s the set of all of the constants (in which case there is no empty subalgebra).

For example, the [[trivial subgroup]] of a [[group]] is $\{e\}$ (where $e$ is the [[identity element]] of the group), and the [[trivial subring]] of a [[ring]] is $\{0, 1\}$.  The [[trivial ideal]] of a ring is just $\{0\}$, because here we are treating the ring as a [[module]] over itself.
