The __spectral theorems__ form a cornerstone of [[functional analysis]]. They are a vast generalization to infinite-dimensional [[Hilbert spaces]] of a basic result in linear algebra: an $n \times n$ Hermitian matrix can be diagonalized or conjugated to a diagonal matrix with real entries along the diagonal.

### memory hook
This is a short description of a simple version of the spectral theorem that may appeal to some readers:

Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a Hilbert space and A be an selfadjoint operator on $\mathcal{H}$. Then we can form the smallest [[von Neumann algebra]] $\mathcal{R}$ generated by both A and $\mathbb{1}$, the identity operator. This is an abelian algebra, that is, via the [[Gelfand representation]], the abelian version of the [[Gelfandâ€“Naimark theorem]], isometric isomorph to the algebra of continuous complex valued functions of a compact Hausdorff space. The spectral integral of A now becomes the Lebesgue (or Riemann) integral of a continuous function.
