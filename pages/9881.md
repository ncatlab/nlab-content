## Idea

In [[perturbative string theory]] [[scattering amplitudes]] are defined as in [[quantum field theory]], but with [[n-point functions]] of 1-dimensional [[worldline]] theories replaced by those of [[worldsheet]] [[2d CFTs]]. 

## Properties

### Finiteness
 {#Finiteness}

The amplitudes are thought (see the commented [references below](#References)) to come out term-wise (for each "loop order" hence for each [[genus]] and number of punctures of ([[super Riemann surface|super]]-)[[Riemann surfaces]]) finite (at least UV-finite), hence [[renormalization|renormalized]]: the higher string oscillations may be seen as providing canonical counterterms for the massless excitations in the [[effective field theory]]. In this sense string theory provides a [[UV-completion]] of these effective field theories ([[supergravity]] coupled to [[Yang-Mills theory]]).

###### Remark

The full [[perturbation series]] is the [[sum]] of all these (finite) contributions over the [[genus|genera]] of [[Riemann surfaces]] (the "loop orders"). This _sum_ diverges, even if all loop orders are finite. Notice though, that a non-trivial [[perturbation theory|perturbative]] [[QFT]] is not supposed to have a finite [[radius of convergence]] of its scattering amplitudes, since that would imply convergence also for _negative_ [[coupling constant]], which is physically unreasonable. (For the [[bosonic string]] the perturbation series has apparently been explicitly shown not to be [[Borel summation|Borel resummable]].) For more on this see at _[[non-perturbative effect]]_ and _[string theory FAQ -- Is the divergence of the pertubation series fatal?](string+theory+FAQ#NonConvergenceOfPerturbationSeries)_.

###### Remark

A string scattering amplitude is called _UV-finite_ at a given loop order ([[genus]] of a [[Riemann surface]] $\Sigma$ with $n$ marked points/string insertions) if the [[correlation function]] $\langle \phi_1, \cdots, \phi_n\rangle_{\Sigma}$ is finite for every single such [[Riemann surface]]. The actual string amplitude at order $(g,n)$ though is the averaging of this over all possible [[conformal structures]] on $\Sigma$, hence the  [[integration]] of the [[correlation function]], as a function on the conformal structure, over the compactified [[moduli space of conformal structures]] $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$ (a [[Deligne-Mumford stack]]). 

If also this integral is finite, hence if the total [[measure]] on the [[moduli space of conformal structures]] is finite, then one says the amplitude is _IR-finite_.

This distinction between UV-finiteness and IR-finiteness is not always highlighted in all of the articles below. All authors argue that the string is _UV-finite_ to all order. The IR-finiteness is only discussed much more recently at low loop order.

IR non-finiteness is not physically fatal. For instance if a [[perturbation theory|perturbative]] theory of [[quantum gravity]] develops a [[cosmological constant]] perturbatively, then the perturbation series will be IR-divergent, signifying the fact that background spacetime without cosmological constant is no longer a solution to the quantum-corrected [[equations of motion]]. Nevertheless, these potential IR-divergences seem to be absent for the [[superstring]] perturbation series. For the [[cosmological constant]] case this can already be seen from the fact that the [[effective QFT]] of [[type II supergravity]] etc. does not admit a cosmological constant, for that would violate [[supersymmetry]].

### Open-closed scattering duality and KLT relations

The [[open/closed string duality]] implies certain relations in string scattering amplitudes that in the point-particle limit induces relations between [[scattering amplitudes]] in [[Yang-Mills theory]] and in [[gravity]]. These are the _[[KLT relations]]_ in [[QFT]].

### Twistor string amplitudes and MHV amplitudes in Yang-Mills theory

The scattering amplitudes in [[twistor string theory]] induce the MHV amplitudes in ([[super Yang-Mills theory|super]]-)[[Yang-Mills theory]]. See at _[[string theory results applied elsewhere]]_ in the section _[Application to QCD -- Scattering amplitudes](string+theory+results+applied+elsewhere#QCDScatteringAmplitudes)_.

### $p$-Adic formulation

The [[Veneziano amplitude]] (open bosonic string tree-level scattering) has an equivalent formulation as the inverse product over all [[prime numbers]] $p$ of an amplitude computed not by an integral in the real but in the [[p-adic numbers]]. For other open string amplitudes this holds up to some regularization. This is the topic of _[[p-adic string theory]]_, see there for more details.
