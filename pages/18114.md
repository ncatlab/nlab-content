###### Proposition

Using [[classical logic]], then:

If $(X,d)$ is a [[metric space]], regarded as a [[topological space]] via its [[metric topology]], then the following are equivalent:

1. $(X,d)$ is a [[compact topological space]].

1. $(X,d)$ is a [[sequentially compact topological space]].

###### Proof

Assume first that $(X,d)$ is a [[compact topological space]]. Let $(x_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a [[sequence]] in $X$. We need to show that it has a sub-sequence which [[convergence|converges]].

Consider the [[topological closures]] of the sub-sequences that omit the first $n$ elements of the sequence

$$
  F_n
   \;\coloneqq\;
  Cl(\left\{ 
    x_k \,\vert\, k \geq n
  \right\})
$$

and write

$$
  U_n \coloneqq X \backslash F_n
$$

for their [[open subset|open]] [[complements]].

Assume now that 

$$
  (\star) 
  \phantom{AA} 
  \underset{n \in \mathbb{N}}{\cap} F_n \;= \; \emptyset
$$

or equivalently that 

$$
  \underset{n \in \mathbb{N}}{\cup} U_n 
  \;=\;
  X
  \,,
$$

hence that $\{U_n \to X\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is an [[open cover]]. By the assumption that $X$ is compact, this would imply that there is a [[finite set|finite]] [[subset]] $\{i_1 \lt i_2 \lt  \cdots \lt i_k\} \subset \mathbb{N}$ with

$$
  \begin{array}
    X & = U_{i_1} \cup U_{i_2} \cup \cdots \cup U_{i_k}
    \\
    & = U_{i_k}
  \end{array}
  \,.
$$

This in turn would mean that $F_{i_k} = \empty$, which contradicts the construction of $F_{i_k}$. Hence we have a [[proof by contradiction]] that assumption $(\ast)$ is wrong, and hence that there must exist an element

$$   
  x \in \underset{n \in \mathbb{N}}{\cap} F_n
  \,.
$$

By definition of [[topological closure]] this means that for all $n$ the [[open ball]] $B^\circ_x(1/(n+1))$ around $x$ of [[radius]] $1/(n+1)$ must intersect the $n$th of the above subsequence:

$$
  B^\circ_x(1/(n+1))
  \,\cap\,
  \{x_k \,\vert\, k \geq n \} 
  \;\neq\;
  \emptyset
  \,.
$$ 

Picking one point $(x'_n)$ in the $n$th such intersection for all $n$ hence defines a sub-sequence, which converges to $x$.
