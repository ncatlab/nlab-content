## Idea

The _bicommutant theorem_ characterizes concrete [[von Neumann algebras]] as those concrete $C^*$-[[C-star algebra|algebras]] ($C^*$-algebras of [[bounded operator]]s on some [[Hilbert space]]) that are the [[commutant]]s of their own commutants.


## Statement

The __bicommutant theorem__ (as known as the _double commutant theorem_, or _von Neumann's double commutant theorem_) is the following result:

###### Theorem

Let $A \subseteq B(H)$ be a sub-$*$-[[star-algebra|algebra]] of the algebra of [[bounded linear operator|bounded linear operators]] on a [[Hilbert space]] $H$. Then $A$ is a [[von Neumann algebra]] (and therefore also a $C^*$-[[C-star algebra|algebra]]) in $H$ if and only if $A = A''$, where $A'$ denotes the [[commutant]] of $A$.

Notice that the condition of $A$ being a von Neumann algebra (being closed in the [[weak operator topology]]; "weak" here can be replaced by "strong", "ultrastrong", or "ultraweak" as described in [[operator topology]]), which is a [[topology|topological]] condition, is by this result equivalent to an algebraic condition (being equal to its bicommutant).
