# Effective monomorphisms

## Idea


* [[effective epimorphism]] $\Rightarrow$ [[regular epimorphism]] $\Leftrightarrow$ [[covering]]

* [[effective monomorphism]] $\Rightarrow$ [[regular monomorphism]] $\Leftrightarrow$ [[embedding]] .


## Definition

A [[morphism]] $f : X \to Y$ in a [[category]] $C$ is an **effective monomorphism** if

1. it has a cokernel pair, i.e. if the [[pushout]] $Y \coprod_X Y$ exists;

1. it is [[generalized the|the]] [[equalizer]] of the canonical pair of morphisms $Y \stackrel{\to}{\to}Y \coprod_X Y$.

Such a morphism, $f$, may probably also be called an [[embedding]].  

The dual concept is that of [[effective epimorphism]]. See there for more discussion.
