A variety of algebras (not to be confused with an [[algebraic variety]]) is a classical notion from [[universal algebra]] that includes nearly all of the usual kinds of algebraic objects, such as [[groups]], [[rings]], [[vector spaces]] (over a fixed [[field]]), and so on.  Those algebraic objects that don\'t form a variety of algebras, such as [[fields]], can still usually be easily described as a subclass of an algebraic variety (in this case, [[commutative rings]]).
