## Idea

Given a [[monoid]] $R$ in a [[monoidal category]] $(\mathcal{C}, \otimes)$, $R$[[Mod]] is the [[category]] whose [[objects]] are $R$-[[modules]] in $\mathcal{C}$ and whose morphisms are module homomorphisms.

Specifically if $(\mathcal{C}, \otimes)$ is the category [[Ab]] of [[abelian groups]] and $\otimes$ the [[tensor product of abelian groups]], then $R$ is a [[ring]]. 

We write just $Mod$ for the category whose objects are pairs $(R,N)$ consisting of a monoid $R$ and an $R$-module, and whose morphisms may also map between different monoids.



## Definition of $Mod$

We assume that the ambient [[monoidal category]] is [[Ab]] with the [[tensor product of abelian groups]]. But the definition works more generally

+-- {: .num_defn #ModSpelledOut}
###### Definition

An [[object]] in $Mod$ is a pair $(R,N)$ consisting of a commutative [[ring]] $R$ and an $R$-[[module]] $N$. 

A [[morphism]]

$$
 (\phi,\kappa) :  (R,N) \to (R',N')
$$

is a pair consisting of a ring [[homomorphism]] $\phi : R \to R'$ and a morphism $\kappa : N \to \phi^* N'$ of $R$-modules, where $\phi^* N'$ is the [[tensor product]] $\phi^* N' := R \otimes_{\phi} N$.

=--

## Properties

### $Mod$ as a bifibration
 {#ModAsBifibration}

Projecting out the first items in the pairs appearing in def. \ref{ModSpelledOut} yields a canonical functor

$$
  p :Mod \to CRing
$$

$$
  (R,N) \mapsto R
  \,.
$$

that exhibits $Mod$ as a [[bifibration]] over $R$.

The fiber of this projection over a ring $R$ is $Mod_R$, the category of $R$-modules.

In particular the fiber over the initial commutative ring $R = \mathbb{Z}$ is

$$
  Mod_{\mathbb{Z}} = Ab
$$

the category [[Ab]] of abelian groups.


### Tangents and deformation theory
 {#TangentsAndDeformationTheory}

By an old observation of Quillen -- reviewed at [[module]] -- the bifibration $Mod \to CRing$ this is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to the category of fiberwise abelian [[group object]] in the [[codomain fibration]] $[I,CRing] \to CRing$:

$$
  (Mod \to CRing) \simeq Ab([I,CRing]] \to CRing)
  \,.
$$

For a fixed ring $R$, the category $Mod_R$ of $R$-modules is canonically equivalent to $Ab(CRing/R)$, the category of abelian [[group object]]s in the [[overcategory]] $CRing/R$:

$$
  Mod_R \simeq Ab(CRing/R)
  \,.
$$

This says that $Mod \to Ring$ is the [[tangent category]] of $CRing$: the above equivalence regards an $R$-module $N$ equivalently as the square-0-extension ring $R \oplus N$ (with producte $(r_1,n_1) \cdots (r_2,n_2) = (r_1 r_2, r_1 n_2 + r_2 n_1)$), which may be thought of as the ring of functions on the infinitesimal neighbourhood of the 0-section of the [[vector bundle]] (or rather [[quasicoherent sheaf]]) over $Spec R$ that is given by $N$.

There is thus another natural projection from $Mod$ to rings, namely the functor that remembers these square-0-extensions

$$
  f : Mod \to CRing
$$

$$
  (R,N) \mapsto R \oplus N
  \,.
$$

This functor has a [[left adjoint]] $\Omega : CRing \to Mod$ which is also a [[section]]: this is the functor that sends a ring to its module of [[Kähler differential]]s.

$$
  (\Omega \dashv f) :  Mod \stackrel{\overset{\Omega}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{f}{\to}}
  CRing
  \,.
$$

### $R Mod$ is an abelian category
 {#RModIsAbelian}

Let the ambient [[monoidal category]] be [[Ab]] equipped with the [[tensor product of abelian groups]].

+-- {: .num_theorem #RModIsAbelian}
###### Theorem

Let $R$ be a [[commutative ring]]. Then $R Mod$ is an [[abelian category]].

=--

We discuss now all the ingredients of this statement in detail.

Let $U : R Mod \to Set$ be the [[forgetful functor]] to the underlying sets.

+-- {: .num_prop #RModHasZeroObject}
###### Proposition

$R Mod$ has a [[zero object]], given by the 0-module, the trivial abelian group equipped with trivial $R$-action.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #RModHasKernelsAndCokernels}
###### Proposition


$R Mod$ has all [[kernels]]. The kernel of a homomorphism $f : N_1 \to N_2$ is the set-theoretic [[preimage]] $U(f)^{-1}(0)$ equipped with the induced $R$-module structure.

$R Mod$ has all [[cokernels]]. The cokernel of a homomorphism $f : N_1 \to N_2$ is the [[quotient]] abelian group 

$$
  coker f = \frac{N_2}{im(f)}
$$

of $N_2$ by the [[image]] of $f$.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

$U : R Mod \to Set$ preserves and reflects [[monomorphisms]] and [[epimorphisms]]:

A homomorphism $f : N_1 \to N_2$ in $R Mod$ is a [[monomorphism]] / [[epimorphism]] precisely if $U(f)$ is an [[injection]] / [[surjection]].


=--

+-- {: .num_prop #RModIsAbEnriched}
###### Proposition

$R Mod$ is an [[Ab-enriched category]]. 

For $N_1, N_2 \in R Mod$ the abelian group structure on $Hom(N_1,N_2)$ is given by argumentwise addition in $N_2$: $(f_1 + f_2) : n \mapsto f_1(n) + f_2(n)$.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

In fact $R Mod$ is even a [[closed category]], but this we don not need for showsing that it is abelian.

=--

Prop. \ref{RModHasZeroObject} and prop. \ref{RModIsAbEnriched} together say that:

+-- {: .num_cor #RModIsAdditive}
###### Corollary

$R Mod$ is an [[pre-additive category]]. 

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #RModHasProductsAndCoproducts}
###### Proposition

$R Mod$ has all [[products]] and [[coproducts]], being [[direct products]] and  [[direct sums]]. 

The products are given by [[cartesian product]] of the underlying sets with componentwise addition and $R$-action.

The direct sum is the subobject of the product consisting of tuples of elements such that only finitely many are non-zero.

=--

Together cor. \ref{RModIsAdditive} and prop. \ref{RModHasProductsAndCoproducts} say that:

+-- {: .num_cor #RModIsAdditive}
###### Corollary

$R Mod$ is an [[additive category]].

=--


+-- {: .num_prop #InRModMonosAreKernelOfTheirCokernel}
###### Proposition

In $R Mod$

* every [[monomorphism]] is the [[kernel]] of its [[cokernel]];

* every [[epimorphism]] is the [[cokernel]] of its [[kernel]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Using prop. \ref{RModHasKernelsAndCokernels} this is directly checked on the underlying sets.

=--

Now cor. \ref{RModIsAdditive} and prop. \ref{InRModMonosAreKernelOfTheirCokernel} imply theorem \ref{RModIsAbelian}, by definition.
