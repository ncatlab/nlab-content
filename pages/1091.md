**Base change** is another term for [[pullback]] of a morphism:

if

$$
  \array{
    U \times_X Y &\to & Y
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    U &\to& X 
  }
$$

is a [[pullback]] square in some [[category]] then the [[morphism]] $U \times_X Y \to U$ is the **base change** or **base extension** of $Y \to X$ along $U \to X$.

#Remarks#

* The [[duality|dual]] concept is [[cobase change]].
