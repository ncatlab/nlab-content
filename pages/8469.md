## Idea

A _Bishop set_ is a notion of _[[set]]_ in [[constructive mathematics]], commonly used in [[Bishop's constructive mathematics]].

In ([Bishop](#Bishop)) the notion of _[[set]]_ is specified by stating that a set has to be given by a description of how to build [[elements]] of this set and by giving a binary [[relation]] of [[equality]], which has to be an [[equivalence relation]]. 

A [[function]] from a set $A$ to a set $B$ is then given by an operation, which is compatible with the equality (i.e. two elements which are equal in A are mapped to two elements which are equal in B), and is described as "a finite routine $f$ which assigns an element $f(a)$ of $B$ to each given element $a$ of $A$". This notion of routine is left informal but must "afford an explicit, finite, mechanical reduction of the procedure for constructing $f(a)$ to the procedure for constructing $a$."

These ideas have been formalized in [[type theory]], where they serve to set up [[set theory]] in an ambient type theoretic [[logical framework]]. See _[Formalization in type theory](#FormalizationInTypeTheory)_ below.


## Formalization in type theory
 {#FormalizationInTypeTheory}

Formally, the definition of Bishop set presumes some prior notion of "collection" (the elements) and "relation" (the equality) that can be put together.  These collections are sometimes called [[presets]], and can be formalized in various ways.  In particular, presets generally lack operations such as [[quotients]] and even [[subsets]].

One of the most common approaches is to use [[type theory]], where the collections are simply types.  Note that this is a different approach to the use of type theory in foundations of mathematics than that of, for instance, [[homotopy type theory]] --- in the latter, type theory is enriched with operations on types such as quotients, enabling them to be the basic set-like objects out of which mathematics is built; while in the Bishop-set approach one defines "sets" as types equipped with extra structure, so that the sets have quotient-type operations even though the types do not.  There is an analogy to the construction of the [[exact completion]] of a category, which has quotients even if the original category does not.

Frequently, the type theories used for this purpose do not even have a separate notion of "relation" or "proposition", and thus the untruncated [[propositions as types]] interpretation is used for the equivalence relations in a Bishop set.  That is, one has a type $X:Type$ of elements and a type family $R:X\to X \to Type$ with witnesses that it is "reflexive, symmetric, and transitive", but nothing prevents $R(x,y)$ from having more than one element.  (If the type theory has [[identity types]], one could demand that $R$ consist of [[h-propositions]], but at least historically this is not often done.)  This means that categorically, the Bishop sets are most like the [[ex/lex completion]] of the category of types --- although the morphisms in the ex/lex completion are defined as a *quotient* in the ambient set theory, whereas the morphisms between Bishop sets simply form another Bishop set.

For example, see ([Palmgren05](#Palmgren05)) for an exposition and ([Coquand-Spiwack, section 3](#CoquandSpiwack)) for a brief list of the axioms.

In the context of type theory a Bishop set is sometimes called a __[[setoid]]__.


## Properties

### The predicative topos of Bishop sets

In much of [[set theory]] the [[category]] [[Set]] of all sets is a [[Topos]]. For Bishop sets formalized in [[type theory]] this is not quite the case. Instead:

###### Theorem

The category of Bishop sets in [[Martin-LÃ¶f dependent type theory]] is a [[strong predicative topos]].

This is ([van den Berg, theorem 6.2](#vdBerg)), based on ([Moerdijk-Palmgren, section 7](#MoerdijkPalmgren)).
