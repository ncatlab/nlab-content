## Idea

A _Bishop set_ is a notion of _[[set]]_ in [[constructive mathematics]].

In ([Bishop](#Bishop)) the notion of _[[set]]_ is specified by stating that a set has to be given by a description of how to build [[elements]] of this set and by giving a binary [[relation]] of [[equality]], which has to be an [[equivalence relation]]. 

A [[function]] from a set $A$ to a set $B$ is then given by an operation, which is compatible with the equality (i.e. two elements which are equal in A are mapped to two elements which are equal in B), and is described as "a finite routine $f$ which assigns an element $f(a)$ of $B$ to each given element $a$ of $A$". This notion of routine is left informal but must "afford an explicit, finite, mechanical reduction of the procedure for constructing $f(a)$ to the procedure for constructing $a$."

These ideas have been formalized in [[type theory]], where they serve to set up [[set theory]] in an ambient type theoretic [[logical framework]]. See _[Formalization in type theory](#FormalizationInTypeTheory)_ below.


## Formalization in type theory
 {#FormalizationInTypeTheory}

It is direct and natural to represent formally the notion of Bishop sets
in [[type theory]]. See for instance ([Palmgren05](#Palmgren05)) for an exposition and ([Coquand-Spiwack, section 3](#CoquandSpiwack)) for a brief list of the axioms.

In the context of type theory a Bishop set is sometimes called a __setoid__.


## Properties

### The predicative topos of Bishop sets

In much of [[set theory]] the [[category]] [[Set]] of all sets is a [[Topos]]. For Bishop sets formalized in [[type theory]] this is not quite the case. Instead:

###### Theorem

The category of Bishop sets in [[Martin-Löf dependent type theory]] is a [[strong predicative topos]].

This is ([van den Berg, theorem 6.2](#vdBerg)), based on ([Moerdijk-Palmgren, section 7](#MoerdijkPalmgren)).
