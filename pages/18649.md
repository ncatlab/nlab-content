## Idea

A [[Lagrangian field theory]] for fields defined by some [[field bundle]] is called _locally variational_ if its [[equations of motion]] is determined by a [[source form]] on the [[jet bundle]] which is _locally_, i.e. over some [[neighbourhood]] of any point of the base space, the [[Euler-Lagrange variational derivative]] of a [[Lagrangian density]] on this neighbourhood, but not necessarily globally so.

## Example

Field theories with [[WZW terms]] and [[higher WZW terms]] are (only) locally variational: the WZW term is the pullback to the [[jet bundle]] of a [[circle n-bundle with connection]] on the base space (e.g. a [[line bundle with connection]], [[bundle gerbe with connection]], etc.) and the corresponding [[Euler-Lagrange form]] is proportional to the [[horizontal form]]-projection of the [[curvature]] $(n+1)$-form. This is locally [[exact differential form|exact]], but, crucially, not globally so, unless the [[principal infinity-bundle|higher bundle]] is [[flat infinity-bundle]].

Beware that this is not an exotic situation: already the Lagrangian density for the [[charged particle]], regarded as a field theory on its [[worldline]], coupled to an [[electromagnetic field]] with non-trivial [[magnetic charge]] ([[first Chern class]]) is of this form: the [[interaction]] term which gives the [[Lorentz force]] is an example of a non-trivial [[WZW term]] as above.
