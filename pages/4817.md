## Idea

Ordinary [[heterotic string theory]] is the study of the perturbation series of correlators of a certain 2-dimensional [[SCFT]] over surfaces. The resulting [[S-matrix]] is interpreted as encoding the scattering amplitudes of strings propagating in some target space.

Among the [[gauge field]]s that these strings are charged under is the [[Kalb-Ramond field]], which is a [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle 2-bundle with connection]].

By general [[electric-magnetic duality]] (see [Freed](#Freed) for a formal treatment in [[differential cohomology]]) one expects there to be a dual theory theory where the $(p=1)$-dimensional strings are replaced by their magnetic duals, which are $10-(p+2)-2 = 5$-branes. 

The study of the corresponding perturbation series over correlators of the 6-dimensional fivebrane worldvolume [[SCFT]] over 6-volumes is far from tractable,  but a handful of consistency checks exist, that the corresponding _dual heterotic string theory_ makes sense.

Where the [[quantum anomaly]]-cancellation for the heterotic string involves the demand for (twisted) [[string structure]]s, that for the dual theory involves [[fivebrane structure]]s (which gives these their name).

On p. 3 and 4 the latter reviews the worldsheet description of the relevant terms for the string and then look at the corresponding situation for the 5-brane on p. 6.

So this is the EM-dual analog of the Killingback-Witten-computation of the fermionic  anomaly that leads to [[string structure]]s in the heterotic string (see there). Where the former involves cancelling the first fractional [[Pontryagin class]], this involves the second.
