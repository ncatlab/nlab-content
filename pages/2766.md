[[Eric]]: **Help!** I started to write this and realized that I didn't understand it well enough.

The idea is that a cone morphism $\phi:T\to T'$ "pulls back" a component $T'_j:c'\to F(j)$ to a component $T_j:c\to F(j)$ via

$$T_j = T'_j\circ \phi.$$

_Toby_:  Does my addition below help?

Let $F:J\to C$ be a [[diagram]] in a category $C$.

Let $T:\Delta c\to F$ and $T':\Delta c'\to F$ denote [[cones]] over $F$. A **cone morpmism** is a $C$-morphism $\phi\colon c \to c'$ such that ...
