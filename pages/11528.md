## Idea

Given a [[simplicial group]] $G_\bullet$, the _Borel model structure_ is a [[model category]] structure on the [[category]] of [[simplicial sets]] equipped with $G$-[[action]] which presents the [[(∞,1)-category]] of [[∞-actions]] of the [[∞-group]] (see there) presented by $G$.

In the context of [[equivariant homotopy theory]] this is also called the "coarse model structure" (e.g. [Guillou, section 5](#Guillou)), since it is not equivalent to the homotopy theory of [[G-spaces]] which enters [[Elmendorf's theorem]].


## Definition

Writing $\mathbf{B}G_\bullet$ for the one-object [[sSet-enriched category]] ([[simplicial groupoid]]) whose [[hom-object]] is $G_\bullet$. Write $sSet^{\mathbf{B}G_\bullet}$ for the corresponding [[sSet]]-[[enriched functor category]].

This carries the projective global [[model structure on functors]] ([[model structure on simplicial presheaves]]) $(sSet^{\mathbf{B}G_\bullet})_{proj}$. This is the Borel model structure ([DDK 80](#DDK80)).

## Properties

### Relation to slicing over $\bar W G$

The central theorem of ([DDK 80](#DDK80)) is that the Borel model structure is [[Quillen equivalence|Quillen euqivalent]] to the [[slice model structure]] of the standard [[model structure on simplicial sets]] over the model $\bar W G_\bullet$ (see at _[[simplicial group]]_ for notation and details) for the [[delooping]] of $G_\bullet$.

This kind of relation is discussed in more detail at _[[∞-action]]_.

### Cofibrant replacement and homotopy quotients/fixed points

The cofibrations $i \colon X \to Y$ in $(sSet^{\mathbf{B}G_\bullet})_{proj}$ are precisely those maps such that

1. the underlying homomorphism of [[simplicial sets]] is a [[monomorphism]];

1. the $G_\bullet$-action is relatively [[free action]], i.e. [[free action|free]] on all [[simplices]] not in the [[image]] of $i$.

This is part of ([DDK 80, proposition 2.2. ii)](#DDK80)). Also ([Guillou, prop. 5.3](#Guillou)).

In particular this means that an object is cofibrant if the $G_\bullet$-[[action]] on it is [[free action|free]]. Hence cofibrant replacement is in particular given by forming the product with the model $W G_\bullet$ for the total space of the [[universal principal bundle]] over $G_\bullet$ (see at _[[simplicial group]]_ for notation and more details).

It follows that for $X,A\in (sSet^{\mathbf{B}G_\bullet})_{proj}$ the [[derived hom space]]

$$
  R Hom_G(X,A)
$$

models the $G$-[[equivariant cohomology]] of $X$ with [[coefficients]] in $A$. 

In particular,if $A$ is fibrant (the underlying simplicial set is a [[Kan complex]]) then 

1. if the $G_\bullet$-action on $A$ is trivial, then 

   $$
     R Hom_G(X,A) \simeq Hom_G(W G \times X , A) \simeq Hom(W G \times_G X, A)
   $$

   is equivalently maps of [[simplicial sets]] out of the [[Borel construction]] on $X$;

1. if $X= \ast $ is the point then 

   $$
     R Hom_G(X,A) \simeq Hom_G(W G, A) \simeq Hom(\bar W G , A)  \simeq A^{h G}
   $$

   is the [[homotopy fixed points]] of $A$.

### Relation to the fine model structure of equivariant homotopy theory

The identity functor [[Quillen adjunction]] between the Borel model structure and [[equivariant homotopy theory]] ([Guillou, section 5](#Guillou)).

The left adjoint is

$$
  L = id \;\colon\; G_\bullet Act_{coarse} \longrightarrow G_\bullet Act_{fine}
$$

from the Borel model structure to the genuine [[equivariant homotopy theory]].

Because:

First of all, by ([Guillou, theorem 3.12, example 4.2](#Guillou)) $sSet^{\mathbf{B}G_\bullet}$ does carry a fine model structure. By ([Guillou, last line of page 3](#Guillou)) the fibrations and weak equivalences here are those maps which are ordinary fibrations and weak equivalences, respectively, on $H$-[[fixed point]] simplicial sets, for all subgroups $H$. This includes in particular the trivial subgroup and hence the identity functor

$$
  R = id \;\colon\; G_\bullet Act_{fine} \longrightarrow G_\bullet Act_{coarse}
$$

is right Quillen.
