###### Definition

A **cell spectrum** is a topological [[sequential spectrum]] $X$ realized as the [[colimit]] over a sequence of spectra $\ast = X_0 \to X_1 \to X_2 \to X_3 \to \cdots$ such that there are morphisms

$$
  j_n 
   \;\colon\; 
   \left(
      \underset{i \in I_n}{\sqcup} \Sigma^\infty S^{q_n}
   \right)
   \longrightarrow
   X_n
$$

with $X_{n+1}= Cone(j_n)$ (the [[mapping cone]]).

A cell spectrum is a **[[CW-spectrum]]** if each attaching map $\Sigma^\infty S^{q_n}\to X_n$ factors through a $X_k \to X_n$ with $k \lt q$.

###### Definition

A CW-spectrum, def. \ref{CellSpectrum}, is called a _[[finite spectrum]]_ (or countable spectrum, etc.) if it has [[finite number|finitely many]] cells (countably many cells) according to def. \ref{CellOfACWSpectrum}.
