
Welcome Stephan!

We appreciate your recent edits and would like to ask you to announce them at [Latest Changes](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Mathforge/nForum/?CategoryID=5).  (You can do so anonymously or create an account on that Forum.)

You can also say something about yourself here (no need to keep the current text).  It might also be a good idea to sign your full name (in case more 'Stephan's come).

Thank you, I just created [[Stephan Alexander Spahn]] to these purposes and will announce my (substantial) edits on the forum. I did -up to now- not realize that [[Stephan]] exists and so did not intend to ignore your suggestions, sorry!
