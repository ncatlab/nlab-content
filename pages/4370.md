## Idea

Given a [[topological space]] (or [[locale]]) $X$, a [[subspace]] of $X$ is __dense__ if its [[closed subspace|closure]] is all of $X$.


## Properties

In [[locale]] theory, we have the curious property that any [[intersection]] of dense subspaces is still dense.  (This of course fails rather badly for [[topological spaces]], where the intersection of all dense topological subspaces is the space of [[isolated point]]s.)  One consequence is that every locale has a smallest dense sublocale, the [[double negation sublocale]].


In point-set topology, a space is [[separable space|separable]] if and only if it has a dense subspace with [[countable set|countably]] many points.
