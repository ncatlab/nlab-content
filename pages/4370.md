## Idea

Given a [[topological space]] (or [[locale]]) $A$, a [[subspace]] $X$ of $A$ is __dense__ if its [[closed subspace|closure]] is all of $A$: $cl(X)=A$.

## Remark

Conversely, a subset $X\subseteq A$ of a topological space $A$ is called **nowhere dense** if $Int(cl(X))=\emptyset$.

## Properties

* If $X\subseteq A$ is a dense subset of topological space $A$, then $X\cap Y\neq\emptyset$ for all non-empty open sets $Y$.

* If $X\subseteq A$ is a dense subset of topological space $A$ and $X$ is connected, so is $A$.

* In point-set topology, a space is [[separable space|separable]] if and only if it has a dense subspace with [[countable set|countably]] many points.

* In [[locale]] theory, we have the curious property that any [[intersection]] of dense subspaces is still dense.  (This of course fails rather badly for [[topological spaces]], where the intersection of all dense topological subspaces is the space of [[isolated point]]s.)  One consequence is that every locale has a smallest dense sublocale, the [[double negation sublocale]].
