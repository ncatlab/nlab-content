## Idea

The analog of [[velocity]] for rotational movement. 

For rotation in a [[plane]] inside a [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ the angular velocity is a [[bivector]] in $\wedge^2 \mathbb{R}^n$ of the form

$$
  \dot \omega \,\, e_1 \wedge e_2
  \,,
$$

where $e_1$ and $e_2$ are unit vector spanning the plane of rotation, and where $\dot \omega$ is the magnitude of the angular velocity.

Of $n = 3$ (and only then) can we identify [[bivector]]s with plain [[vector]]s (by the dual operation induced by the [[Hodge star operator]]). Often in the literature only this "angular velocity vector" in 3 dimensions is considered.
