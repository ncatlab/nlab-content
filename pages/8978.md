## Definition

An **$A_n$-space** is a space (in the sense of an [[infinity-groupoid]], usually presented by a [[topological space]] or a [[simplicial set]]) with a multiplication that is associative up to higher homotopies involving up to $n$ variables.

* An $A_0$-space is a pointed space.
* Same with an $A_1$-space.
* An $A_2$-space is an [[H-space]].
* An $A_3$-space is a homotopy associative H-space (but no coherence is required of the associator).
* An $A_4$-space has an associativity homotopy that satisfies the pentagon identity up to homotopy, but no further coherence.
* ...
* An [[A-infinity space]] has all coherent higher associativity homotopies.
