## Idea

A _$cat^n$-group_ is a strict [[n-fold category]] [[internal category|internal]] to [[Grp]]. 

Regarding a [[group]] as a [[groupoid]] with a single object, this is the same as an [[n-fold category|(n+1)-fold groupoid]] in which in one direction all morphisms are endomorphisms.

As with the cases $n=1$ and 2, there is a neat purely group theoretic definition of these objects.

## Algebraic definition

A _cat$^n$-group_  is a group $G$ together with $2n$ endomorphisms $s_i, t_i, (1 \le i \le n)$ such that 

$$s_i t_i = t_i, and  t_i s_i = s_i  for all  i, $$

$$ s_i s_j = s_j s_i,   t_i t_j = t_j t_i, s_i t_j = t_j s_i  for i\neq  j$$ 

and, for all $i$,

$$[ Ker\, s_i, Ker\, t_i] = 1.$$

Morphisms of cat$^n$-groups are the obvious things, morphisms of the groups compatible with the endomorphisms.

A cat$^{n}$-group is thus a group with $n$ independent cat$^{1}$-group structures on it.

## Special cases

* A $cat^0$-group is a group.

* A [[cat-1-group]] is a strict [[2-group]], viewed in a slightly different way.


## Homotopical example 

 For simplicity, we describe  $\Pi X_{*}$   in a special
case, namely  when  the $n$-cube of spaces $X_{*}$   arises from a pointed  $(n +
1)$-ad  $ (X;X_1,\ldots ,X_n)$  by the  rule:  $X_{
\langle n \rangle}  = X$  and for  $A$  properly contained in
$\langle n \rangle$,   $X_A = \bigcap _{i \not\in A} X_i$, with
maps  the inclusions.  Let  $\Phi$   be the space of maps  $I^n
\to   X$  which take  the  faces of  $I^n$  in the  $i$th
direction into  $X_i$.  Notice that  $\Phi$  has the  structure
of $n$ compositions derived from the gluing of cubes in each
direction.  Let  $\bullet  \in  \Phi$   be the constant map at the
base point.   Then  $G = \pi_1(\Phi ,\bullet )$ is certainly a
group.  Gilbert, 1988, identifies   $G$ with  Loday's  $\Pi
X_{*}$, so that Loday's results, obtained by methods of
simplicial  spaces, show that  $G$  becomes a cat$^n$-group.  It
may also be shown that  the  extra groupoid structures are
inherited from the compositions on  $\Phi$.   It  is this
cat$^n$-group which is written  $\Pi X_*$   and is called
the  _fundamental  cat$^n$-group of the  $(n + 1)$-ad_. 

See also [[crossed n-cube]] for an alternative description. 


## Remarks

* Even though $cat^n$-groups are examples of strict [[n-fold category|(n+1)-fold categories]], Loday has shown that the [[homotopy category]] of $cat^{n-1}$-groups is equivalent to that of spaces which are pointed connected [[homotopy n-type]]s. Hence for $cat^n$-groups (thought of as $(n+1)$-fold groupoids) the [[homotopy hypothesis]] is true in this sense. See there for more details.

+-- {.query}
[[Tim Porter|Tim]] Is the first statement above correct? $Cat^n$-groups are examples of strict (n+1)-fold categories, not strict n=categories or am I missing something? (28-09-2010<- corrected)

[[Ronnie Brown|Ronnie]]  Agreed, and I have corrected that. This is important since an [[n-category]] internal to [[Grp]] is equivalent to a single vertex [[crossed complex]]  of length $n+1$. 

It is not so clear how to construct a homotopical functor from $n$-cubes of _non pointed spaces_, and what should be the receiving category.

This paper also uses the term n-cat-group, but we later used the term cat$^n$-group to make it clearer that these were an [[n-fold category]] [[internalization|internal]] to [[Grp]].
