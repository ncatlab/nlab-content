
__Quotient category__ is an alternative name (used especially in 1960s and 1970s) for a result of a strict [[localization functor]], that is, given a category $C$ and a class of morphisms $\Sigma\subset C$ the category $\Sigma^{-1} C$ equipped with a functor $Q_\Sigma: C\to \Sigma^{-1} C$ sending all morphisms in $\Sigma$ to [[isomorphism|isos]] and which has a strict universal property, that is, for every other functor $F: C\to A$ inverting all morphisms in $\Sigma$, there is a factorization $F = \tilde{F}\circ Q$. 

Note that large part of a topos community and category community calls by localization those (possibly non-[[strict localization functor|strict]]) localization functors, for which the localization functor is left exact and admits a right adjoint. These people often use quotient functor when removing the "admits right adjoint" and "left exact" conditions..

Following the extensions of an early work of Serre by Grothendieck and Gabriel, the term [[Serre quotient category]] or simply a quotient category is especially used when the input is a [[thick subcategory]] $T$ of an abelian category $A$, instead of the class $\Sigma$. A nonempty full subcategory of an abelian category is thick in strong sense if it is closed under subquotients and extensions. Then one defines $A/T$ to have the same objects as $T$ and 

$$
(A/T)(X,Y) := colim A(X',Y/Y')
$$

where the colimit runs through all subobjects $X'\subset X$, $Y'\subset Y$ such that $X/X' \in Ob T$, $Y'\in Ob T$. The quotient functor $Q: A\to A/T$ is obvious. 

A basic example is the quotient of the category of abelian groups modulo the torsion groups: This category is equivalent to the category of $\mathbb{Q}$-vector spaces, by the functor which maps an abelian group $M$ to the scalar extension $M \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} \mathbb{Q}$.

A thick subcategory (here always in strong sense) is said to be [[localizing subcategory|localizing]] if and $Q$ admits a right adjoint $A/T\to A$, often called the __section functor__. Every coreflective thick subcategory admits a section functor, and the converse holds if $A$ has injective envelopes. A thick subcategory $T\subset A$ is a coreflective iff $(T,F)$ is a [[torsion theory]] where

$$
F := \{X\in Ob A\,|\,A(T,X) = 0\}
$$

Yaron:  The above definition of a quotient category appears to be different from that of CWM (p. 51 of the second edition), where a quotient category is obtained by identifying arrows.  Perhaps there is a need for disambiguation?
