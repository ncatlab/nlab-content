A binary [[relation]] from a [[set]] $X$ to a set $Y$ is called **functional** if every element of $X$ is related to at most one element of $Y$.  Notice that this is the same thing as a **partial function**, which is often called simply a **function** in secondary-school mathematics.  A total [[function]], however, is precisely a relation that is both functional and [[entire relation|entire]].

Like any relation, a functional relation $r$ can be viewed as a [[span]]
$$ \array {
  &                    & \Delta_r \\
  & \swarrow_{\iota_r} &          & \searrow^{\phi_r} \\
X &                    &          &                   & Y
} $$
Such a span is a relation iff the pairing map from the **domain** $\Delta_r$ to $X \times Y$ is an [[injection]], and such a relation is entire iff the **inclusion** map $\iota_r$ is also an injection.
