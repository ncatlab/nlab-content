## Idea

The concept of _$Spin(7)$-instantons_ ([Lewis 98](#Lewis98)) is an analogue of that of [[Yang-Mills instantons]] for [[special unitary group|SU(2)]]-[[principal connections]] on 4-dimensional manifolds, to (8-dimensional) [[Spin(7) manifolds]].

## Definition 

On a [[Spin(7) manifold]] the [[differential n-form|differential 2-forms]] decompose into two [[irreducible representations]], $\Lambda_7$ and $\Lambda_{21}$ under the [[action]] of [[Spin(7)]] (e.g. [Lewis 98, p. 13](#Lewis98)).

A connection on the $Spin(7)$-manifold is called a _$Spin(7)$-instanton_ it its [[curvature]] 2-form has vanishing component in the representation $\Lambda_7$ ([Lewis 98, def.3.1](#Lewis98)).
