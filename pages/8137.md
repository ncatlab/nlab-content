## Idea

A dual space is a [[dual in a closed category]] of [[vector spaces]].


## Definitions

Let $K$ be a [[field]] (or any [[commutative ring|commutative]] [[rig]]), and let $V$ be a [[vector space]] (or [[module]]) over $K$.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition
The __dual space__ or __dual module__ of $V$ is the vector space $V^*$ of [[linear functionals]] on $V$.  That is, $V^*$ is the [[internal hom]] $[V,K]$ (thinking of $K$ as a vector space over itself: a [[line]]).
=--

More generally, let $K$ and $L$ be [[rings]] (or [[rigs]]) *not* assumed commutative, and let $V$ be a $K$-$L$-[[bimodule]].

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definitions
The __left dual module__ of $V$ is the right $K$-module $V^*$ of left $K$-module [[homomorphisms]] from $V$ to $K$.  The __right dual module__ of $V$ is the left $L$-module $^*V$ of right $L$-module homomorphisms from $V$ to $L$.
=--

Now let $V$ be a [[topological vector space]] over the [[ground field]] $K$.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definitions
The __dual space__ of $V$ is the topological vector space $V^*$ of [[continuous linear functionals]] on $V$, equipped with the [[weak-* topology]] (meaning the [[initial topology]] generated by the elements of $V$, viewed as themselves linear functionals on $V^*$).
=--

In principle, there is no conflict among these definitions, the most general case (so far) being a topological bimodule over two topological rigs; the non-topological cases simply involve [[discrete spaces]].  In practice, however, some complications are possible:

*  If the rig $K$ is an [[associative algebra|algebra]] over another rig $L$, then any $K$-module $V$ is also an $L$-module, but the dual as a $K$-module is different from the dual as an $L$-module.  So one may speak of the __$K$-dual__ or the __dual over $K$__.

*  A topological vector space $V$ has an [[underlying]] discrete vector space, and these have different duals.  So one speaks of the __topological dual__ and the __algebraic dual__ (respectively).  If $V$ is considered with several different topologies (say called 'weak' and 'strong'), then one may speak of the __weak dual__ and the __strong dual__ (etc).


## Dual bases

If $B$ is any [[basis]] of $V$, then we can sometimes turn $B$ into a basis $B^*$ of the dual space $V^*$.

We will begin with the definition of what *might* be the dual basis, cautioning that it is not always a basis:

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition (dual basis)
Treating $B$ as a [[family]] $(b_i)$ with index set $I$, $B^*$ is the family $(b^i)$ (with the same index set) such that
$$ b^i(b_j) = \delta^i_j $$
(the [[Kronecker delta]]).
=--

Since $B$ is a basis of $V$, this formula defines $b^i$ for each index $I$, so $B^*$ exists; but in general there is no reason why $B^*$ should be a basis of $V^*$.  However, if $V$ has [[finite set|finite]] [[dimension]] or is a [[Hilbert space]], then $B^*$ is a basis of $V^*$.


## Applications

A [[von Neumann algebra]] (abstractly) is precisely a $C^*$-[[C-star-algebra|algebra]] whose underlying [[Banach space]] is the dual space of some (other) Banach space.


## Examples

See [[Riesz representation theorem]].
