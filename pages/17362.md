##Idea

In [[computer science]] and more generally, **sugaring** is the modification of formal notation into a form which is more readable for humans, thereby "sweetening" it for consumption. Peter Landin first used the expression 'syntactic sugaring' in the context of interpretations of terms in the [[Î»-calculus]] ([Landin64](#Landin64)).

Often there are many ways to sugar a formal expression into natural language.

###Example

Consider the type theoretic expression $\sum_{x: man} \sum_{y: donkey} x\;owns\; y$.

Ranta (1994, p. 68) gives nine sugarings for it:

* there is a man and there is a donkey and he owns it,
* there is a man and he owns a donkey,
* there is a man and there is a donkey that he owns,
* there is a donkey and a man owns it,
* a man owns a donkey,
* there is a donkey that a man owns,
* there is a man such that there is a donkey and he owns it,
* there is a man who owns a donkey,
* there is a man such that there is a donkey that he owns.
