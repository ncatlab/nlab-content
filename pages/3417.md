## Idea

Depending on the chosen [[model category]] structure, the [[category]] [[SSet]] of [[simplicial set]]s may model [[∞-groupoids]] (for the standard [[model structure on simplicial sets]]) or [[(∞,1)-categories]] in the form of [[quasi-categories]] (for the [[Joyal model structure]]) on [[SSet]].

Accordingly, there are [[model category]] structures on [[SSet]]-[[enriched categories]] that similarly model [[(n,r)-categories]] with $r$ shifted up by 1:

* there is a model structure on $SSet$-enriched categories whose fibrant objects are [[∞-groupoid]]/[[Kan complex]]-enriched categories and which models [[(∞,1)-categories]];

* there is another model structure on $SSet$-enriched categories whose fibrant objects are [[(∞,1)-category]]/[[quasi-category]]-enriched categories, and which model [[(∞,2)-categories]].
