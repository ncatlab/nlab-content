##Idea##

Heap is an algebraic structure which is basically
equivalent to group when one forgets about which element is the unit. Similar notions are [[zoranskoda:affine space|affine space]], principal homogeneous space and so on. However, the notion of a heap has a directness and simplicity in the sense that it is formalized as an algebraic structure with only one ternary operation satisfying a short list of axioms. If we start with a group the ternary operation is defined via $(a,b,c)\mapsto ab^{-1}c$. 
We interpret that operation as shifting $a$ by the (right)
translation in the group which translates $b$ into $c$. 
There is also a dual version, [[quantum heap]]. 

##Definition##

A __heap__ $(H,t)$ is a pair of the nonempty set $H$
and a ternary operation $t : H \times H \times H\to H$ satisfying the relations

$$ t(b,b,c) = c = t(c,b,b)$$

$$ t(a,b,t(c,d,e)) = t(t(a,b,c),d,e) $$

##Automorphism group##

If we constructed a heap from a group, that the original group can be recovered up to isomorphism from its associated heap as an automorphism group of the heap. 
Let $(H,t)$ be a heap. We construct the automorphism
group of it. The elements of $Aut(H)$ will be set bijections
of the form $t(\cdot,a,b): H \rightarrow H$
where $a,b \in H$, and $\cdot$ is a place-holder and 
$Aut(H)$ becomes a group with respect to the composition 
(composing to the right):
\[ t(\cdot,c,d) \cdot_{Aut(H)} t(\cdot, a,b) =
 t(t(\cdot,c,d),a,b) = t(\cdot,c,t(d,a,b)). \]
The last expression proves that the result of the composition
is in $Aut(H)$, rather then only in symmetric group of $H$.
If that is (what is most sensible) taken as

the definition then the identity above is axiom for the action.
The inverse map (and inverse in the group
of $t(\cdot,a,b)$ is $t(\cdot,b,a)$ by the axioms
and the unit of the group is identity isomorphism $t(\cdot, x,x)$
where $x$ is any element of $H$. 
Thus $Aut(H)$ is a subgroup of the symmetric group of $H$.

The following are equivalent

(i) bijections $t(\cdot,a,b)$ and $t(\cdot,a',b')$ are
the same maps,

(ii) $t(a,a',b') = b$,

(iii) $t(b,b',a') = a$.

Proof. (ii) follows from (i) and $t(a,a,b) = b$.

(iii) follows from (ii) by applying $t(\cdot,b',a')$ on the
right. Similarly (ii) follows from (iii).

(i) follows from (ii) by the calculation:
\[ t(x,a',b') = t(t(x,a,a),a',b')= t(x,a,t(a,a',b'))
 = t(x,a,b).\]

One should conclude noticing that 
the defining action of $Aut(H)$ is transitive
(by $t(a,a,b) = b$) and  free (if $t(a,b,c) = a$ then
by the previous statement $t(x,b,c) = x$ for each $x$, and in particular $t(b,b,c) = b$ and also $t(b,b,c) = c$.

One should note that a more general class of algebraic structures having a heap as its main archytepal example are so called Mal'cev algebras, and they form Mal'cev variety in the sense of universal algebra. Heaps in the sense of algebra should not be confused with heaps in the sense of theoretical computer science. There is a number of synonyms for a term heap, and it is similar in other languages. In Russian one of the expressions is "gruda"  meaning a 'heap of soil', what is a pun as it is parallel to the russian word "gruppa" meaning a 'group': forgetting the unit element is sort of creating an amorphous version. 
There is an oidificatoin ([[horizontal categorification]]) of a heap, sometimes called _heapoid_.
