## Idea

The _natural_ [[model category]] structure on the 1-[[category]] of [[groupoid]]s and [[functor]]s is a presentation of the [[(2,1)-category]] of [[groupoid]]s, [[functor]]s and [[natural isomorphism]]s.

This is one flavor of the various [[natural model structure]]s on categories and higher categories.

## Definition


+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

Let [[Grpd]] be the 1-[[category]] of [[small category|small]] [[groupoid]]s and [[functor]]s between them. Say a morphism in $Grpd$ -- a [[functor]] $f : C \to D$ -- is 

* a _weak equivalence_ if it is an [[equivalence of categories]];

* a _fibrations_ if it is an [[isofibration]];

* a _cofibration_ if it is an injection on [[object]]s.

=--

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

Equipped with this structure $Grpd_{nat}$ is a [[model category]] which is

* [[cofibrantly generated model category|cofibrantly generated]];

* [[left proper model category|left proper]]

* a [[simplicial model category]] with respect to the natural [[sSet]]-[[enriched category]] structure induced by the canonical enrichment over itself, under the [[nerve]].

This is originally due to ([Anderson](#Andeson)) and ([Bousfield](#Bousfield)). A detailed discussion is in section 6 of ([Strickland](#Strickland)). In the context of the [[model structure for (2,1)-sheaves]] it appears as ([Hollander, theorem 2.1](#Hollander)).

## Properties

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Observation

The model structure $Grpd_{nat}$ is the restriction of the
[[joyalscatlab:Model structures on Cat|natural model structure on Cat]] from [[categories]] to groupoids.

+-- {: .un_def}
###### Definition

Let

$$
  (\tau \dashv N) : Grpd \stackrel{\overset{\tau}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{N}{\to}}
   sSet
$$

be the pair of [[adjoint functor]]s, where $N$ is the [[nerve]] of [[groupoid]]s with values in [[sSet]].

=--

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

With the natural model structure on $Grpd$ and the standard [[model structure on simplicial sets]] this is a [[Quillen adjunction]]

$$
  (\tau \dashv N) : Grpd_{nat} \stackrel{\overset{\tau}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{N}{\to}}
   sSet_{Quillen}
  \,.
$$

and $Grpd_{nat}$ is the [[transferred model structure]] obtained from $sSet_{Quillen}$ under this adjunction.
