## Idea

In the context of _[[geometric quantization]]_ a _metaplectic correction_ is a choice of [[metaplectic structure]] on the given [[symplectic manifold]]. It allows to make the [[space of states (in geometric quantization)|space of states]] into a [[Hilbert space]].

It is called a _correction_ mostly for historical reasons, since it was not included in all constructions from the beginning. 

## Properties

### Induced inner product / Hilbert space structure

A [[metaplectic structure]] on a [[symplectic manifold]] $(X, \omega)$ induces a [[metalinear structure]] on each [[Lagrangian submanifold]] $Q \hookrightarrow X$. This allows to form a [[square root]] line bundle $\sqrt{\Lambda^n T^* Q}$ of the [[canonical bundle]] of $Q$ and hence induces an [[inner product]] on [[sections]] of the [[tensor product]] $E|_Q \otimes \sqrt{\Lambda^n T^* Q}$ with the restriction of any [[line bundle]] $E$ on $X$ (a prequantum line bundle, notably).
