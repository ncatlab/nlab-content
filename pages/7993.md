## Idea

In the context of _[[geometric quantization]]_ a _metaplectic correction_ is a choice of [[metaplectic structure]] on the given [[symplectic manifold]]. It allows to make the [[space of states (in geometric quantization)|space of states]] into a [[Hilbert space]].

It is called a _correction_ mostly for historical reasons, since it was not included in all constructions from the beginning.
