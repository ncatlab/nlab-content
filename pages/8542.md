## Idea

In [[formal logic]], a _metalanguage_ is a [[language]] (formal or informal) in which the symbols and rules for manipulating another (formal) language -- the _object language_ -- are themselves formulated.  That is, the metalanguage is the language used when talking *about* the object language.

For instance the symbol $\phi$ may denote a [[proposition]] in a [[formal system]], but the statement “$\phi$ can be proven” is not itself a proposition in the formal system, but a statement in the metalanguage, often denoted

$$
  \vdash \phi \, true
$$

and then called a _[[judgement]]_ instead. Or, more generally, if the truth of $\phi$ depends on the truth of some other proposition $\psi$ then 

$$
  \psi \, true \vdash \phi \, true
$$

is the [[hypothetical judgement]] in the metalanguage that there is a [[proof]] of $\phi$ in the [[context]] in which $\psi$ is assumed.

In contrast, the expression $(\psi \to \phi)$ may denote another [[proposition]] in the object language, a [[conditional statement]].


## Examples

* A system of [[natural deduction]] with its [[type formation]]/[[term introduction]]/[[term elimination]] and [[computation rules]] is the metalanguage for [[type theory]].
