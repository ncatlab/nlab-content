## Idea

The canonical [[line bundle]] over a [[projective space]] is sometimes called its "tautological line bundle". For more see at _[[classifying space]]_.

## Examples

* The [[basic complex line bundle on the 2-sphere]] is the tautological [[complex line bundle]] over the [[complex projective space]] $\mathbb{C}P^1 \simeq S^2$ (the [[Riemann sphere]])
