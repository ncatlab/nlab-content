## Definition

For $R$ a [[ring]], its _group of units_, denoted $R^\times$ or $GL_1(R)$, is the [[group]] whose elements are the elements of $R$ that are invertible under the product, and whose group operation is the multiplication in $R$.

###### Remark

There is an [[adjunction]]

$$
  (R[-]\dashv (-)^\times)
  \colon 
  Alg_R \stackrel{\overset{R[-]}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{(-)^\times}{\to}} Grp
$$

between the [[category]] of [[associative algebras]] over $R$ and that of [[groups]], where $R[-]$ forms the [[group algebra]] over $R$ and where $(-)^\times$ assigns to an $R$-algebra its group of units.
