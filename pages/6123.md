## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For $R$ a [[ring]], its _group of units_, denoted $R^\times$ or $GL_1(R)$, is the [[group]] whose elements are the elements of $R$ that are invertible under the product, and whose group operation is the multiplication in $R$.

## Properties

### Relation to the multiplicative group

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The group of units of $R$ is equivalently the collection of [[morphisms]]
from $Spec R$ into the [[group of units]] $\mathbb{G}_m$

$$
  GL_1(R) = R^\times \simeq Hom(Spec R, \mathbb{G}_m)
  \,.

### Relation to the group ring

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

There is an [[adjunction]]

$$
  (R[-]\dashv (-)^\times)
  \colon 
  Alg_R \stackrel{\overset{R[-]}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{(-)^\times}{\to}} Grp
$$

between the [[category]] of [[associative algebras]] over $R$ and that of [[groups]], where $R[-]$ forms the [[group algebra]] over $R$ and where $(-)^\times$ assigns to an $R$-algebra its group of units.
