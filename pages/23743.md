## Idea

Similar to how equality is stable if its [[double negation]] implies equality, an *equivalence relation* ought is **stable** if its [[double negation]] [[implication|implies]] equality. 

## Definition 

In [[set theory]], an [[equivalence relation]] $\equiv$ on a set $S$ is **stable** if for all $a \in S$ and $b \in S$, if $\neg\neg(a \equiv b)$ then $a \equiv b$. 

In [[type theory]], a ([[proposition]]-valued) [[equivalence relation]] $\equiv$ on a type $T$ is **stable** if for all $a:T$ and $b:T$, there is a function $p(a, b):\neg\neg(a \equiv b) \to (a \equiv b)$. 

## Properties

* The negation of every stable equivalence relation is an [[apartness relation]].
