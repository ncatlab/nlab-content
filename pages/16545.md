## Idea

An _evolutionary vector_ field is a particular class of vertical [[vector field]] on the infinite [[jet bundle]] $J^\infty E$ of a [[fiber bundle]] $\pi: E \to M$, which can be interpreted as the generator of a transformation of the space $\Gamma(E)$ of sections of $E$. There are basically two different ways to define an evolutionary vector field, both of which serve the same purpose.

Evolutionary vector fields describe [[symmetries]] of [[Lagrangian field theory|Lagrangian systems]] in the formulation of the [[variational bicomplex]], and as such form an ingredient of [[Noether's theorem]].

## Definition as a vector field on $J^\infty E$

###### Definition

An **evolutionary vector field** is a [[vector field]] $v$ on the infinite [[jet bundle]] which is vertical with respect to the projection $\pi_\infty: J^\infty E \to M$ and for which $\mathcal{L}_v d = d \mathcal{L}_v$ and $\mathcal{L}_v = \iota_v \delta + \delta \iota_v$. Here $d$ is the horizontal derivative on forms on $J^\infty E$, while $\delta$ is the vertical derivative. We denote the subspace of evolutionary vector fields as $\mathfrak{X}_{ev}(J^\infty E) \subset \mathfrak{X}_V(J^\infty E)$.

Equivalently, one can define an evolutionary vector field as a vertical vector field which preserves the [[contact ideal]], i.e., for which $\mathcal{L}_v\theta$ is a [[contact form]] whenever $\theta$ is a [[contact form]].

Note that every evolutionary vector field is uniquely defined by its action on the pullbacks of functions on $E$ to $J^\infty E$. To formalize this, one can use the following notion.

###### Definition

Let $v \in \mathfrak{X}_{ev}(J^\infty E)$ be an evolutionary vector field. Its **characteristic** is the map $\pi_{\infty,0*} \circ v: J^\infty E \to V E$.

## Definition as a generalized vector field on $E$

A generalized vector field on $E$ can be seen as a vector field on $E$ whose coefficients are functions on $J^\infty E$. More formally, it is a particular map from $J^\infty E$ to $T E$. Here we are interested only in a particular class of vertical vector fields.

###### Definition

An **evolutionary vector field** is a map $w: J^\infty E \to V E$ from the infinite [[jet bundle]] $J^\infty E$ to the [[vertical tangent bundle]] $V E$ of the total space $E$, such that $\nu \circ w = \pi_{\infty,0}$, where $\nu: V E \to E$ is the bundle map of $V E$ and $\pi_{\infty,0}: J^\infty E \to E$ is the target map of the jet bundle.

Every evolutionary vector field can unique be prolonged to a vector field on $J^\infty E$.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Let $w$ be an evolutionary vector field. Its **prolongation** to $J^\infty E$ is the unique vertical vector field $pr w$ on $J\infty E$ such that $w$ and $pr w$ agree on functions on $E$ and $pr w$ preserves the contact ideal, i.e., $\mathcal{L}_v\theta$ is a [[contact form]] whenever $\theta$ is a [[contact form]].

## Relation between both definitions

If $v$ is an evolutionary vector field in the sense of the first defintion, then its characteristic $\pi_{\infty,0*} \circ v$ is an evolutionary vector field in the sense of the second definition. Conversely, if $w$ is an evolutionary vector field in the sense of the second defintion, then its prolongation $pr w$ is an evolutionary vector field in the sense of the first definition. Further, $pr (\pi_{\infty,0*} \circ v) = v$ and $\pi_{\infty,0*} \circ (pr w) = w$, so that there is a one-to-one correspondence between both definitions.
