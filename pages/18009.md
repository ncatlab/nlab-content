## Idea

Any [[free loop space]] $\mathcal{L}X$ has a canonical [[action]] ([[infinity-action]]) of the [[circle group]] $S^1$. The [[homotopy quotient]] $\mathcal{L}(X)/S^1$ of this action might be called the _cyclic loop space_ of $X$. 

If $X = Spec(A)$ is an [[affine variety]] regarded in [[derived algebraic geometry]], then $\mathcal{O}(\mathcal{L}Spec(A))$ is the [[Hochschild homology]] of $A$ and $\mathcal{O}((\mathcal{L}Spec(A))/S^1)$ the corresponding [[cyclic homology]], see the discussion at _[[Hochschild cohomology]]_.

If $X = Y//G$ is the [[homotopy quotient]] of a [[topological space]] by a [[topological group]] action, regarded as a locally constant $\infty$-stack, so that the $S^1$-action on $\mathcal{L}(X//G)$ is an $B \mathbb{Z}$-action, then the restriction of the cyclic loop space to the constant loops $\mathcal{L}_{const}Y//G \to \mathcal{L}(Y//G)$ has been called the _twisted loop space_ in ([Witten 88](#Witten88)). This terminology has been widely adopted, for example in the context of the [[transchromatic character]] map ([Stapleton 11](#Stapleton11))
