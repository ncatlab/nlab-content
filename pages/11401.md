## Idea

Given a [[measure space]] and a [[Hilbert space]], then a _positive-operator valued measure_ (POVM) is essentially a [[probability measure]] with valued in [[positive operators]] on that Hilbert space.

Any such induces a [[quantum operation]] and these are precisely the quantum operations which encode [[quantum measurement]].
