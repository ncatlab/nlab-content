The _Jordan-Hölder theorem_ says that every _[[composition series]]_ of a given [[group]], and every _[[Jordan-Hölder sequence]]_ on an object in an [[abelian category]], has the same length, and the same [[simple object|simple]] factors, up to [[permutation]]. This says that the [[length of an object]] in an abelian category is well defined.
