In a [[cochain complex]] $(V^\bullet,d)$ a **coboundary** is an element in the image of the [[differential]].

More generally, in the context of the [[cohomology|intrinsic cohomology]] of an [[(âˆž,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$, for $X$ and $A$ two objects, a [[cocycle]] on $X$ with coefficients in $A$ is an object in $\mathbf{H}(X,A)$ and a coboundary between cocycles is a [[morphism]] in there.
