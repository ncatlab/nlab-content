Let $A$ be a [[dg-category]], so that one has a mapping complex of morphisms $Map_A(x,y)$ between any two objects $x$ and $y$.  In analogy with [[simplicially enriched category|simplicially enriched categories]], the **homotopy category** of $A$ is the [[preadditive category]] $ho(A)$ whose objects are the objects of $A$, morphism groups are given by
  \[ \Hom_{ho(A)}(x, y) = H^0(Map_A(x,y)) \]
for any two objects $x$ and $y$, and composition is induced from the composition law of $A$.  Here $H^0(-)$ denotes the zeroth [[cohomology]] group of the complex (which is by convention graded cohomologically).
