## Idea

For a [[classical mechanics|classical mechanical]] system, the [[equations of motion|laws of motion]] can be expressed in terms of an [[action]] principle: the actual paths must be the (locally) extremal paths of the [[action functional]]. 

In one of the formulations of the classical mechanics, called Lagrangean formalism, every mechanical system is characterized by its configuration space and a single function called Lagrangian which determines the laws of motion (the initial configuration should be given independently).

The **Lagrangian**, Lagrangian function or Lagrangean $L = L(q,\stackrel{\cdot}q,t)$ is a real valued function of the points in [[configuration space]] and their time derivatives (for some sytems also depending on time), such that the corresponding action principle can be expressed as [[Euler-Lagrange equation]]s: for all $i$, 

$$
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \stackrel{\cdot}{q}_i} \right) - \frac{\partial L}{\partial {q}_i}  = 0
$$

Here $q = (q_1,\ldots, q_n)$ is the coordinate in the configuration space. 

For continuum systems satisfying reasonable locality, Lagrangians can be expressed in terms of integrating a local quantity, so-called Lagrangian density. 

## Definition

For $X$ a ([[spacetime]]) [[smooth manifold]] of [[dimension]] $n$ and $E \to X$ a field [[bundle]] with [[jet bundle]] $j_\infty E \to X$ let $\Omega^{\bullet, \bullet}(j_\infty E)$ be the corresponding [[variational bicomplex]].

A **Lagrangian** on $E$ is an element

$$
  L \in \Omega^{n,0}(j_\infty E)
$$

regarded as a [[differential form]]-valued [[functional]] on the space of [[section]]s:

$$
  L : (\phi \in \Gamma(E)) \mapsto L(j_\infty \phi)
  \,.
$$

The [[integral]]

$$
  \int_X L(j_\infty(-)) : \Gamma(\phi) \to \mathbb{R}
$$

is the corresponding [[local action functional]].
