## Idea

A [[filter]] is __improper__ if it is the whole thing ... whatever thing the filters are filters in.


## Definitions

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition (improper filter in a lattice or other proset)

If $L$ is a [[lattice]] or even a [[proset]], then $L$ is an [[filter]] in itself, the __improper filter__.

###### Definition (improper filter on a set)

If $S$ is a [[set]], then the __improper filter__ on $S$ is the [[power set]] of $S$.
=--

Of course, the improper filter *on* $S$ is simply the improper filter *in* the power set of $S$.


## Properties

The improper filter contrasts with [[proper filters]] (all of the other filters).

The improper filter does not count as a [[prime filter]] or an [[ultrafilter]], because it is [[too simple to be simple]], although it may satisfy careless or naïve definitions of those concepts (which must be required to be proper).

Conversely, sometimes one defines 'filter' to exclude the improper filter, especially in [[analysis]] and [[topology]]; however, this makes the set of all filters less nice to work with.
