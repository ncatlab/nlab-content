The [[background gauge fields]] appearing in [[string theory]] are formally [[cocycles]] in [[twisted cohomology|twisted]] and [[differential cohomology|differential]] refinements of [[smooth infinity-groupoid|smooth]] [[cohomology]].

This page contains a list of examples.

## Introductory example: twisted unitary bundles with connection

We discuss here aspects of a simple example in an elementary and expository way. This is meant to introduce basic ideas of the [general theory](GeneralTheory) discussed below by way of example, and serve as a backdrop for the more systematic discussion of the [examples below](#Examples).
