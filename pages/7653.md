The [[background gauge fields]] appearing in [[string theory]] are formally [[cocycles]] in [[twisted cohomology|twisted]] and [[differential cohomology|differential]] refinements of [[smooth infinity-groupoid|smooth]] [[cohomology]].

This page contains a list of examples.

## Introductory example: twisted unitary bundles with connection

We discuss here aspects of a simple example in an elementary and expository way. This is meant to introduce basic ideas of the [general theory](GeneralTheory) discussed below by way of example, and serve as a backdrop for the more systematic discussion of the [examples below](#Examples).

###### Remark

In the formulation of [[dependent type theory]] this statement reads as 
follows.

(check!)

Let 

$$
  \array{
     X &&&& A
     \\
     & {}_{\mathllap{\phi}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{c}}
     \\
     && 
     B
  }
$$

be two [[display maps]]. The one on the right is expressed as the [[dependent type]]

$$
  b : B \vdash A(b) : Type
  \,.
$$

Then the pullback $f^* \langle A \to B\rangle$ is expressed by [[substitution]]

$$
   x : X \vdash A(\phi(x)) : Type
$$

and next the [[dependent product]] $\prod_f f^* \langle A \to B\rangle$ is

$$
   b : B  \vdash \prod_{x \in \phi^{-1}(b)} A(\phi(x)) : Type
  \,.
$$

$$
   b : B  \vdash \prod_{x \in X(b)} A(b) : Type
   \,.
$$

And this in turn is by definition the [[dependent type|dependent]] [[function type]]

$$
  b : B \vdash X(b) \to A(b) : Type  
  \,.
$$

which expresses the internal hom in the slice over $B$.
