## Idea

The [[background gauge fields]] on [[spacetime]] appearing in [[string theory]] are mathematically described by [[cocycles]] in [[twisted cohomology|twisted]] and [[differential cohomology|differential]] refinements of [[smooth infinity-groupoid|smooth]] [[cohomology]]. A famous example is the [[twisted K-theory]] that describes the [[B-field]]-twisted [[Yang-Mills fields]] over [[D-branes]] in [[type II string theory]]. But there are many more classes of examples of twisted / smooth / differential cohomology appearing throughout string theory.

This page provides a survey of and introduction to such examples, organized along a _[Table of twists](#TableOfTwists)_, that indicates how all of these are instances a single pattern. For further reading and more details see the list of _[related entries](#RelatedEntries)_ and the list of _[references](#References)_ below.

We start with an introduction to the general notion of twisted smooth cohomology by way of the simple but instructive class of examples of

* I) _[Geometric structure (generalized, exceptional)](#VielbeinFields)_,

which serves as a blueprint for all of the examples to follow, and which we use to introduce the general machinery.

(The mathematically inclined reader wishing to see a more formal development of the general theory behind the discussion here should look at the section _[General theory](#GeneralTheory)_ for pointers.)

Then we proceed in direct analogy, but now with ordinary [[gauge fields]] generalized to the genuine [[higher gauge fields]] of string theory, and discuss aspects of the main classes of examples of twisted smooth cohomology appearing there:

* II) _[Spin-, String-, and Fivebrane structure](#SpinStringFivebraneStructures)_;

* III) _[$Spin^c$-, $String^c$-, and $Fivebrane^c$-structure](#TwistedK)_ .

There are various further details and refinements, which however go beyond the intended scope of this page. As an outlook we indicate aspects of

* IV) _[Higher orientifold structure](#HigherOrientifold)_.




## Overview: The Table of Twists
 {#TableOfTwists} 

The following sections discuss classes of examples of [[twisted differential c-structures|twisted smooth structures]] in [[string theory]]. All these examples are governed by the the same general pattern of [[twisted cohomology]] refined to [[smooth infinity-groupoid|smooth cohomology]] (a gentle explanation/example follows [in a moment](#VielbeinFields), for formal details see further [below](#TwistedCohomology)). They are specified by a _universal coefficient bundle_

$$
  \array{ 
    F &\to& E
    \\ 
    && 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mathbf{c}}} 
    \\ 
    && \mathbf{B}G 
   }
$$

which exists in a [[(∞,1)-topos|higher topos]] $\mathbf{H} = $ [[Smooth∞Grpd]] of [[smooth ∞-groupoid|smooth homotopy types]]. 

Here

* $G$ is a [[smooth ∞-group]] -- a higher [[gauge group]];

* $\mathbf{B}G$ is the [[smooth ∞-groupoid|smooth]] [[moduli ∞-stack]] of $G$-[[principal ∞-bundles]];

* $F$ is a coefficient object equipped with a $G$-[[action]];

* $E \to \mathbf{B}G$ is the [[associated ∞-bundle|associated bundle]] to the $G$-[[universal principal ∞-bundle]] over the [[moduli ∞-stack]] $\mathbf{B}G$ of $G$-[[principal ∞-bundles]].

Given such, and given a [[spacetime]]/[[target space]] $X$, we have

* a morphism $\phi : X \to \mathbf{B}G$ determines a _twisting bundle_ or _twisting [[background gauge field]]_ on $X$;

* a lift $\hat \phi$ in 

  $$
    \array{
      X &&\stackrel{\hat \phi}{\to}&& P
      \\
      & {}_{\mathllap{\phi}}\searrow &\swArrow& \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\mathbf{c}}}
      \\
      && \mathbf{B}G
    }
  $$

  is a $\phi$-[[twisted infinity-bundle|twisted bundle]], or $\phi$-twisted background gauge field.

The following table lists examples of such coefficient bundles and tabulates the correspondings twisting fields and twisted fields. This is to be read as an extended table of contents. Explanations are in the sections to follow.

## Examples
 {#Examples}

This section discusses four classes of examples of twisted smooth cohomology in string theory

1. _[Geometric structure (generalized, exceptional)](#VielbeinFields)_

1. _[Spin-, String-, and Fivebrane structure](#SpinStringFivebraneStructures)

1. _[$Spin^c$-, $String^c$-, $Fivebrane^c$-structure](#TwistedK)_

1. _[Higher orientifold structure](#HigherOrientifold)_ 

### **I)** Geometric structure (generalized, exceptional)
 {#VielbeinFields}

The ordinary notion of _[[vielbein]]_ in [[differential geometry]] (equivalently: _[[soldering form]]_ or _[[orthogonal structure]]_) turns out to be a simple special case of the general notion of twisted smooth cohomology that we are concerned with here. Viewed from this perspective it already contains the seeds of all of the more sophisticated examples to be considered below. Therefore we discuss this case here as a warmup, such as to introduce the general theory by way of example. 

#### The class of the tangent bundle
 {#ClassOfTheTangentBundle}

Let $X$ be a [[smooth manifold]] of [[dimension]] $n$. 

By definition this means that there is an [[atlas]] 

$$
  \{ \mathbb{R}^n \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi_i^{-1}}{\to} U_i \hookrightarrow X\}
$$ 

of [[coordinate charts]]. On each overlap $U_i \cap U_j$ of two charts, the [[partial derivatives]] of the corresponding [[coordinate transformations]]

$$
  \phi_j\circ \phi_i^{-1}
  : 
  U_i \cap U_j \subset \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n
$$

form the [[Jacobian matrix]] of [[smooth functions]]

$$
  ((\lambda_{i j})^{\mu}{}_{\mu})
  \coloneqq
  \left[\frac{d}{d x^\nu} \phi_j \circ \phi_i^{-1} (x^\mu)
  \right]
  :
  U_i \cap U_j 
  \to 
  GL_n
$$

with values in invertible [[matrices]], hence in the
[[general linear group]] $GL(n)$. By construction (by the [[chain rule]]), these functions satisfy on triple overlaps of coordinate charts the [[matrix product]] equations

$$
  (\lambda_{i j})^\mu{}_\lambda (\lambda_{j k})^\lambda{}_{\nu} 
  = 
  (\lambda_{i k})^\mu{}_{\nu}
  \,,
$$

(here and in the following sums over an index appearing upstairs and downstairs are explicit)

hence the equation

$$
  \lambda_{i j} \cdot \lambda_{j k} = \lambda_{i k}
$$

in the [[group]] $C^\infty(U_i \cap U_j \cap U_k, GL(n))$ of smooth $GL(n)$-valued functions on the chart overlaps.

This is the _[[cocycle]] condition_ for a smooth [[Cech cohomology|Cech cocycle]] in degree 1 with coefficients in $GL(n)$ (precisely: with coefficients in the [[sheaf]] of [[smooth functions]] with values in $GL(n)$ ). We write

$$
  [(\lambda_{i j})] \in H^1_{smooth}(X, GL_n)
  \,.
$$

It is useful to reformulate this statement in the language of [[Lie groupoids]]/[[differentiable stacks]]. 

* $X$ itself is a Lie groupoid $(X \stackrel{\to}{\to} X)$ with trivial morphism structure;

* from the atlas $\{U_i \to X\}$ we get the corresponding [[Cech groupoid]] 
  $$
    C(\{U_i\}) = 
    (\coprod_{i, j} U_i \cap U_j \stackrel{\to}{\to} \coprod_i U_i)
    = 
    \left\{
      \array{
         && (x,j)
         \\
         & \nearrow &=& \searrow
         \\
        (x,i) &&\to&& (x,k)
      }
      \;\;\;
      for\, x \in U_i \cap U_j \cap U_k
    \right\}
    \,,
  $$

  whose objects are the points in the atlas, with morphisms identifying lifts of a point in $X$ to different charts of the atlas;

* any [[Lie group]] $G$ induces its [[delooping]] [[Lie groupoid]] 
  
  $$
    \mathbf{B}G
    = 
    \left(
       G \stackrel{\to}{\to} * 
    \right)
    \,.
  $$

The above situation is neatly encoded in the existence of a [[diagram]] of Lie groupoids of the form

$$
  \array{
     C(\{U_i\}) &\stackrel{\lambda}{\to}& \mathbf{B} GL(n).
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\simeq}}\downarrow
     \\
     X
  }
  \,,
$$

where

* the left morphism is [[stalk]]-wise (around small enough [[neighbourhoods]] of each point) an [[equivalence of groupoids]] (we make this more precise in a moment);

* the horizontal functor has as components the functions $\lambda_{i j}$ and its functoriality is the cocycle condition $\lambda_{i j} \cdot \lambda_{j k} = \lambda_{i k}$.

A [[natural transformation|transformation]] of smooth functors $\lambda_1 \Rightarrow \lambda_2 : C(\{U_i\}) \to \mathbf{B} GL(n)$ is precisely a [[coboundary]] between two such cocycles.

#### Smooth moduli stacks
 {#SmoothModuliStacks}

We want to think of such a diagram as being directly a morphism of [[smooth infinity-groupoid|smooth groupoids]]


$$
  T X \; : \; X \to \mathbf{B} GL(n) \;\; \in \mathbf{H}
$$

in a suitable context $\mathbf{H}$,
such that this may be regarded as a smooth refinement of the underlying [[homotopy]] class of a  map into the [[classifying space]] $B GL(n)$

$$
  X \to B GL(n) \in Top  
  \,.
$$

Evidently, for this we need to turn the [[stalk]]-wise [[homotopy equivalence]] $C(\{U_i\}) \to X$ into an actual [[homotopy equivalence]]. This is a [[nonabelian cohomology|non-abelian/non-stable]] generalization of what happens in the construction of a [[derived category]], for instance in the theory of [[topological string|topological branes]].

To make this precise, first notice that every Lie groupoid $A = (A_1 \stackrel{\to}{\to} A_0)$ yields on each smooth manifold $U$ a groupoid of maps from $U$ into $A$

$$
  A : U \mapsto (C^\infty(U,A_1) \stackrel{\to}{\to} C^\infty(U,A_0))
  \,,
$$

the groupoid of _smooth $U$-families_ of elements of $A$.

Moreover, for every smooth function $U_1 \to U_2$ there is an evident restriction map $A(U_2) \to A(U_1)$ and so this yields a [[presheaf]] of groupoids, hence a functor $A \in Func(SmthMfd^{op}, Grpd)$. The [[Yoneda lemma]] says that thinking of Lie groupoids as presheaves of ordinary groupoids this way does not lose information --- and [[topos theory]] say that it is generally a good idea.

Let therefore

$$
  \mathbf{H} \coloneqq Func(SmthMfd^{op}, Grpd)[\{stalkwise\, h.e\}^{-1}]
$$

be the [[simplicial localization|localization]] of groupoid-valued presheaves that universally turns [[stalk]]wise [[homotopy equivalences]] into actual homotopy equivalences: if a [[natural transformation]] $\eta : A \to B$ in $Func(SmthMfd^{op}, Grpd)$ is such that for each $U \in $ [[SmthMfd]] and each $x \in U$ there is a [[neighbourhood]] $U_x \subset U$ of $x$ such that $\eta(U_x) : A(U_x) \to B(U_x)$ is an [[equivalence of groupoids]], then $\eta$ has a [[homotopy inverse]] in $\mathbf{H}$.

We call this $\mathbf{H}$ the _[[(2,1)-topos]]_ of _[[smooth infinity-groupoid|smooth groupoids]]_ or of _[[smooth infinity-groupoid|smooth stacks]]_.

Discussed there are tools for describing $\mathbf{H}$ concretely. For the moment we only need to know that

1. the [[Cech nerve]] projection $C(\{U_i\}) \to X$ of every [[open cover]] has a [[homotopy inverse]] in $\mathbf{H}$, as already used;

1. if the cover is _[[good open cover|good]]_ and $G$ is a Lie group, then every morphism $X \to \mathbf{B}G$ in $\mathbf{H}$ is presented by a [[anafunctor|zig-zag]] of the form $X \stackrel{\simeq}{\leftarrow} C(\{U_i\}) \to \mathbf{B}G$.

Then we have

1. a morphism $X \to \mathbf{B} GL(n)$ in $\mathbf{H}$ is precisely a smooth real vector bundle on $X$;

1. a homotopy between two such morphisms in $\mathbf{H}$ is precisely a smooth $GL(n)$-[[gauge transformation]] between the two vector bundles.

Therefore $\mathbf{B}GL(n)$ regarded as an object of $\mathbf{H}$ is the _[[moduli stack]]_ of real vector bundles.

Of course there is a "smaller" Lie groupoid that also classifies real vector bundles, but whose gauge transformations are restricted to be [[orthogonal group]]-valued functions. Passing to this "smaller" Lie groupoid is what the choice of vielbein accomplishes, to which we now turn.


#### Reduction of the structure group
 {#ReductionOfTheStructureGroup}


Consider the defining inclusion of the [[orthogonal group]] into the [[general linear group]]

$$
  O(n) \hookrightarrow GL(n)
  \,.
$$

We may understand this inclusion geometrically in terms of the canonical [[metric]] on $\mathbb{R}^n$. We may also understand it purely [[Lie theory|Lie theoretically]] as the
inclusion of the [[maximal compact subgroup]] of $GL(n)$. This makes it manifest that the inclusion is trivial at the level of [[homotopy theory]] (it is a [[homotopy equivalence]] of the underlying [[topological spaces]]) and hence _only_ encodes geometric information.


The inclusion induces a corresponding inclusion ([[truncated object of an (infinity,1)-category|0-truncated morphism]]) of moduli stacks

$$
  \mathbf{Orth} : \mathbf{B} O(n) \to \mathbf{B} GL(n)
  \;\;\;
  \in \mathbf{H}
$$

simply by regarding it as a morphism of Lie groupoids

$$
  (O(n) \stackrel{\to}{\to} * )
  \to 
  (GL(n) \stackrel{\to}{\to} * )
$$

in the evident way.

Now we can say what a [[Riemannian metric]]/[[orthogonal structure]] on $X$ is: 

A choice of [[orthogonal structure]] on $T X$ is a factorization of the above $GL(n)$-valued cocycle $\lambda$ through $\mathbf{Orth}$, up to a smooth [[homotopy]] $E$ in $\mathbf{H}$, hence a [[diagram]]

$$
  \array{
     X &&\stackrel{h}{\to}&& \mathbf{B} O(n)
     \\
     & {}_{\mathllap{\lambda}}\searrow &\swArrow_{\mathrlap{E^{-1}}}& \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\mathbf{Orth}}}
     \\
     && \mathbf{B}GL(n)
  }
$$

in $\mathbf{H}$.

This consists of two pieces of data

* the morphism $h$ is (by the same reasoning as for $\lambda$ above) a $O(n)$-valued 1-cocycle -- a collection of _orthogonal transition functions_ --  hence on each overlap of coordinate patches a smooth function
  
  $$
    ((h_{i j}){}^a{}_b) : U_i \cap U_j \to O(n)
  $$
  
  such that 

  $$
    h_{i j} \cdot h_{j k} = h_{i k}
  $$

  on all triple overlaps of coordinate charts $U_i \cap U_j \cap U_k$;

* the homotopy $E$ is on each chart a function

  $$
    E_i  = ((E_i)^a{}_\mu) : U_i \to GL(n)
  $$

  * such that on each overlap of coordinate charts it intertwines the transition functions $\lambda$ of the tangent bundle with the new orthogonal transition functions, meaning that the equation

    $$
      (E_i)^a{}_{\mu} (\lambda_{i j})^{\mu}{}_\nu
      =
      (h_{i j})^a{}_b (E_j)^b{}_\nu
    $$

    holds. This exhibits the [[natural transformation|naturality]] [[diagram]] of $E$:

  $$
    \array{
       * &\stackrel{E_i}{\to}& * 
       \\
       {}^{\mathllap{\lambda_{i j}}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{h_{i j}}}
       \\
       * &\stackrel{E_j}{\to}& * 
    }
  $$

The component $h$ defines an $O(n)$-[[principal bundle]] on $X$, or its [[associated bundle|associated]] [[vector bundle]].
The component $E$ is the corresponding **[[vielbein]]**. It exhibits an [[isomorphism]] 

$$
  E : T X \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} V
$$

between a [[vector bundle]] $V \to X$ with [[structure group]] explicitly being the [[orthogonal group]], and the [[tangent bundle]] itself, hence it exhibits the [[reduction of the structure group]] of $T X$ from $GL(n)$ to $O(n)$.

#### Moduli space of orthogonal structures: twisted cohomology
 {#ModuliSpaceOfOrhtogonalStructures}

We consider now the space of choices of vielbein fields on a given tangent bundle, hence the _[[moduli space]]_ or _[[moduli stack]]_ of [[orthogonal structures]]/[[Riemannian metrics]] on $X$.

This is usefully discussed in terms of the [[homotopy fiber]] of the morphism $\mathbf{c} : \mathbf{B}O(n) \to \mathbf{B}GL(n)$. One finds that the homotopy fiber  is the [[coset]] $O(n) \backslash GL(n)$.

This means that there is a diagram

$$
  \array{
     GL(n)/O(n) &\to& \mathbf{B}O(n)
     \\
     \downarrow &\swArrow_{\simeq}& \downarrow
     \\
     * &\to& \mathbf{B} GL(n)
  }
$$

in $\mathbf{H}$, and that $GL(n)/O(n)$ is [[universal property|universal]] with the property of sitting in such a diagram.

We may think of this _[[fiber sequence]]_ as being a bundle in $\mathbf{H}$ over the [[moduli stack]] $\mathbf{B}GL(n)$ with typical fiber $GL(n)/O(n)$. As such, it is  the smooth [[associated infinity-bundle|associated bundle]] to the smooth [[universal principal bundle|universal GL(n)-bundle]] induced by the canonical [[action]] of $GL(n)$ on $O(n)\backslash GL(n)$.

One basic properties of homotopy pullbacks is that they are preserved by forming [[derived hom-space|derived hom-spaces]] $\mathbf{H}(X,-)$ out of any other object $X$. This means that also

$$
  \array{
     C^\infty(X,GL(n)/O(n)) &\to& \mathbf{H}(X,\mathbf{B}O(n))
     &\to&
     \mathbf{H}(X, \mathbf{B}GL(n))
  }
$$

is a [[fiber sequence]]. This in turn says that orthogonal structures on $X$ such that the underlying tangent bundle is trivializable, are given by smooth functions into $GL(n)/O(n)$.

This means that if the tangent bundle $T X$ is trivializable, then the coset space $O(n)\backslash GL(n)$ is the moduli space for vielbein fields on $T X$: 

$$
  (T X \; trivializable)
  \Rightarrow
  SpaceOfVielbeinFieldsOn(T X)
  =
  \mathbf{H}(X, O(n)\backslash GL(n)) = C^\infty(X, O(n)\backslash GL(n))
  \,.
$$

However, if $T X$ is not trivial, then this is true only locally: there is then an [[atlas]] $\{U_i \to X\}$ such that restricted to each $U_i$ the moduli space of vielbein fields is $C^\infty(U_i, GL(n)/ O(n))$, but globally these now glue together in a non-trivial way as encoded by the tangent bundle: we may say that 

the tangent bundle _twists_ the functions $X \to GL(n)/O(n)$. If we think of an ordinary such function as a cocycle in degree-0 cohomology, then this means that a vielbein is a cocycle in $T X$-_[[twisted cohomology]]_ relative to the _twisting coefficient bundle_ $\mathbf{c}$.

We can make this more manifest by writing equivalently

$$
  \array{
    O(n)\backslash GL(n) &\to& (O(n)\backslash GL(n)) // GL(n)
    \\
    && \downarrow   
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}GL(n)
  }
  \,,
$$

where now on the right we have inserted the [[fibration]] resolution of the morphism $\mathbf{c}$ as provided by the [[factorization lemma]]: this is the morphism out of the [[action groupoid]] of the action of $GL(n)$ on $O(n)\backslash GL(n)$.


The pullback

$$
  \array{
    T X \times_{GL(n)} (O(n)\backslash GL(n)) 
      &\to&
    O(n)\backslash GL(n) // GL(n)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    X &\stackrel{T X}{\to}& \mathbf{B}GL(n)
  }  
$$

gives the non-linear $T X$-associated bundle whose space of sections is the "twisted $O(n)\backslash GL(n)$-0-cohomology", hence the space of inequivalent vielbein fields.


#### Moduli stack of orthogonal structures

The above says that the space of vielbein fields is the [[cohomology]] of $T X$ in the [[over-(infinity,1)-topos|slice (2,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}GL(n)}$ with coefficients in $\mathbf{Orth} : \mathbf{B}O \to \mathbf{B}GL(n)$

$$
  \mathbf{Orth} Struc_{TX}(X) 
  \coloneqq
  \mathbf{Orth}(T X)
   \coloneqq
  \mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}GL(n)}(T X, \mathbf{Orth})
  \,.
$$

But also this space of choices of vielbein fields has a smooth structure, it is itself a smooth [[moduli stack]]. This is obtained by forming the [[internal hom]] in the slice over $\mathbf{B}GL(n)$ of the [[locally cartesian closed (infinity,1)-category|locally cartesian closed (2,1)-category]] $\mathbf{H}$.

$$
  \mathbf{OrthStruc}_{T X}(X)
  \coloneqq
  [T X, \mathbf{Orth}]_{\mathbf{B}GL(n)}
  \,.
$$

#### Differential refinement: Spin connection
 {#SpinConnection}

We may further refine this discussion to [[differential cohomology]] to get genuine _differential_ $T X$-twisted $\mathbf{c}$-structures. 

Recall that the moduli stack $\mathbf{B}G$ is presented in $\mathbf{H}$ by the presheaf of groupoids

$$
  \mathbf{B} G : U \mapsto (C^\infty(U,G) \stackrel{\to}{\to} *)
  \,.
$$

We may think of this for each $U$ as being the groupoid of $G$-gauge transformations acting on the trivial $G$-bundle over $U$. A [[connection on a bundle|connection]] on the trivial $G$-bundle is a [[Lie algebra]] valued form $A \in \Omega^1(U, \mathfrak{g})$. Accordingly, the presheaf of groupoids

$$
  \mathbf{B}G_{conn} : U \mapsto (C^\infty(U,G) \times \Omega^1(U, \mathfrak{g}) \stackrel{\to}{\to} \Omega^1(U, \mathfrak{g}) )
$$

is that of $G$-connections and gauge transformations between them: the _[[groupoid of Lie-algebra valued forms]]_ over $U$. As an object of $\mathbf{H} = $ [[smooth infinity-groupoid|SmoothGrpd]] this the [[moduli stack]] of $G$-[[connection on a bundle|connections]]:

$$
  \mathbf{H}(X, \mathbf{B}G_{conn})
  \simeq
  G Bund_\nabla(X)
  \,.
$$

The morphism $\mathbf{Orth}$ has an evident differential refinement to a morphism between such differentially refined moduli stacks

$$
  \mathbf{Orth}_{conn} : \mathbf{B}O(n)_{conn} \to \mathbf{B}GL(n)_{conn}
$$

by acting on the differential forms with the induced inclusion of the [[orthogonal Lie algebra]] into the [[general linear Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{o}(n) \hookrightarrow \mathfrak{gl}(n)$.

The [[homotopy fiber]] of this differential refinement turns out to be the same moduli space as before

$$
  \array{
    GL(n)/ O(n) &\to& \mathbf{B} O(n)_{conn}
    \\
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mathbf{Orth}_{conn}}}
    \\
    && \mathbf{B} GL(n)_{conn}
  }
  \,,
$$

so that the moduli space of "differential vielbein fields" is the same as that of plain vielbein fields. But we nevertheless do gain differential information: consider an [[affine connection]] on the tangent bundle, which is now given by a morphism from $X$ to the moduli stack

$$
  \nabla_{T X} : X \to \mathbf{B}GL(n)
  \,.
$$

This is a $GL(n)$-[[principal connection]] which locally on an atlas is given by the [[Christoffel symbols]] 

$$
  \Gamma_i = ((\Gamma_i)_\mu{}{}^{\alpha}{}_\beta)
  \in 
  \Omega^1(U_i, \mathfrak{gl}(n))
  \,.
$$

A $\nabla_{T X}$-twisted differential cocycle is now a diagram

$$
  \array{
    X &&\stackrel{\nabla_{V}}{\to}&& \mathbf{B}O_{conn}
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{\nabla_{T X}}}\searrow 
     &\swArrow_{E^{-1}}& 
    \swarrow_{\hat {\mathbf{Orth}}}
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}GL(n)_{conn}
  }
  \,.
$$

In components over the atlas, $\nabla_V$ is a "[[spin connection]]" given by local 1-forms $\{\omega_i \in \Omega^1(U_i, \mathfrak{o}(n))\}$

$$
  \omega_i = E_i d_{dR} E_i^{-1} + E_i \Gamma E_i^{-1}
$$

and the vielbeing $E$ now exhibits on each chart $U_i$ the familiar relation between the components of the spin connection and the Christoffel-symbols:

$$
  \omegai{}^a{}_b 
   = 
   E_i^a{}_\nu d_{dR} E_i^\nu{}_b
   +
   E_i^a{}_\nu \Gamma_i {}^\nu{}_\lambda E_i^\lambda{}_b
   \,.
$$


#### Generalized vielbein fields: type II geometry, generalized CY and U-duality

The above discussion of ordinary [[vielbein]] fields is just a special case of an analogous discussion for general [[reduction of structure groups]], giving rise to [[generalized vielbein]] fields. Many geometric structures in string theory arise in this way, as indicated in the [table of twists](#TableOfTwists).

As one more out of these examples, we discuss in the above language of twisted smooth cohomology how a _[[type II geometry]]_ of [[type II supergravity]] is the [[reduction of the structure group]] of the [[generalized tangent bundle]] along the inclusion $O(d) \times O(d) \to O(d,d)$.

Consider  the [[Lie group]] inclusion
$$
  \mathrm{O}(d) \times \mathrm{O}(d)
  \to 
  \mathrm{O}(d,d)
$$

of those [[orthogonal group|orthogonal transformations]], that preserve the positive definite part
or the negative definite part of the [[bilinear form]] of signature $(d,d)$, respectively.

If $\mathrm{O}(d,d)$ is presented as the group of $2d \times 2d$-[[matrix|matrices]] that 
preserve the [[bilinear form]] given by the $2d \times 2d$-matrix
$$
  \eta 
  \coloneqq
  \left( 
     \array{
       0 & \mathrm{id}_d
       \\
       \mathrm{id}_d & 0
     }
  \right)
$$

then this inclusion sends a pair $(A_+, A_-)$ of [[orthogonal group|orthogonal]] $n \times n$-matrices
to the matrix
$$
  (A_+ , A_-) 
    \mapsto 
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
  \left(
    \array{
	   A_+ + A_- & A_+ - A_-
	   \\
	   A_+ - A_- & A_+ + A_-
     }
  \right)
  \,.
$$

This induces the corresponding morphism of 
[[smooth infinity-groupoid|smooth]] [[moduli stacks]], which we denote

$$
  \mathbf{TypeII}
  :
  \mathbf{B}(\mathrm{O}(d) \times \mathrm{O}(d))
  \to 
  \mathbf{B} \mathrm{O}(d,d)  
  \,.
$$

Forming the  [[homotopy fiber]] now yields the coefficient bundle 

$$
  \array{
     O(d) \backslash O(d,d) / O(d)
     &\to&
    \mathbf{B}(\mathrm{O}(d) \times \mathrm{O}(d))
    \\
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mathbf{TypeII}}}
    \\
    && \mathbf{B} \mathrm{O}(d,d)  	
  }
  \,,
$$

There is also a canonical embedding

$$
  \mathrm{GL}(d) \hookrightarrow \mathrm{O}(d,d)
$$

of the [[general linear group]].

In the above matrix presentation this is given by sending

$$
  a
  \mapsto 
  \left( 
     \array{
	    a & 0
		\\
		0 & a^{-T}
      }
  \right)
  \,,
$$

where in the bottom right corner we have the [[transpose matrix|transpose]] of the inverse matrix of the invertble
matrix $a$.

Under this inclusion, the 
[[tangent bundle]] of a $d$-[[dimension|dimensional]] 
[[manifold]] $X$ defines an $\mathrm{O}(d,d)$-[[cocycle]]

$$
  T X \oplus T^* X
  :
  
    X 
     \stackrel{T X}{\to}
    \mathbf{B}\mathrm{GL}(d)  
      \stackrel{}{\to}
    \mathbf{B} \mathrm{O}(d,d) 
  \,.
$$

The [[vector bundle]] canonically associated to this composite cocycle may 
canonically be identified with
the [[direct sum]] vector bundle $T X \oplus T^* X$, and so we will
refer to this cocycle by these symbols, as indicated. 
This is also called the **[[generalized tangent bundle]]** of $X$.


Therefore we may canonically consider the groupoid of 
$T X \oplus T^* X$-twisted $\mathbf{TypeII}$-structures, 
according to the general notion of [[twisted differential c-structures]].


A **type II generalized vielbein** on a [[smooth manifold]] $X$ is a diagram

$$
  \array{
    X &&\stackrel{\widetilde(T X \oplus T^* X)}{\to}&& \mathbf{B}(O(n) \times O(n))
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{T X \oplus T^* X}}\searrow &\swArrow_{E}& \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\mathbf{TypeII}}}
    \\
    && \mathbf{B} O(n,n)
  }
$$

in $\mathbf{H}$, hence a cocycle in the smooth [[twisted cohomology]]

$$
  E 
   \in 
  \mathbf{TypeII}Struc(X)
  \coloneqq
  \mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B} O(n,n)}(T X \oplus T^* X, \mathbf{TypeII})
  \,.
$$


+-- {: .un_prop }
###### Proposition / Definition

  The [[groupoid]] $\mathbf{TypeII}\mathrm{Struc}(X)$
  is that of "generalized vielbein fields" on $X$, as considered for instance 
  around equation (2.24) of ([GMPW](type+II+geometry#GMPW))
  (there only locally, though).
  
  In particular, its set of equivalence classes is the set of 
  type-II generalized geometry structures on $X$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Over a local [[coordinate chart]] $\mathbb{R}^d \simeq U_i \hookrightarrow X$, the most general such generalized vielbein
(hence the most general $\mathrm{O}(d,d)$-valued function)
may be parameterized as
$$
  E = 
  \frac{1}{2}
  \left(
    \array{
	  (e_+ + e_-) + (e_+^{-T} - e_-^{-T})B & (e_+^{-T} - e_-^{-T})
	  \\
	  (e_+ - e_-) - (e_+^{-T} + e_-^{-T})B & (e_+^{-T} + e_-^{-T})
     }
  \right)
  \,,
$$

where $e_+, e_- \in C^\infty(U_i, \mathrm{O}(d))$ are thought of as two 
[[vielbein|ordinary vielbein]] fields, and where $B$ is any smooth skew-symmetric $n \times n$-matrix valued function on 
$\mathbb{R}^d \simeq U_i$. 

By an $\mathrm{O}(d) \times \mathrm{O}(d)$-[[gauge transformation]] this can always be brought
into a form where $e_+ = e_- =: \tfrac{1}{2}e$ such that
$$
  E = 
  \left(
    \array{
	  e & 0
	  \\
	  - e^{-T}B  & e^{-T}
	}
  \right)
  \,.
$$

The corresponding "generalized metric" over $U_i$ is

$$
  E^T 
  E
  = 
  \left(
    \array{
	  e^T & B e^{-1}
	  \\
	  0  & e^{-1}
    }
  \right)
  \left(
    \array{
	  e & 0
	  \\
	  - e^{-T}B  & e^{-T}
    }
  \right)
  = 
  \left(
    \array{
	  g - B g^{-1} B & B g^{-1}
	  \\
	  - g^{-1} B  & g^{-1}
     }
  \right)
  \,,
$$

where

$$
  g \coloneqq e^T e
$$

is the [[metric]] (over $\mathbb{R}^q \simeq U_i$ a smooth function with values in symmetric $n \times n$-matrices) 
given by the [[vielbein|ordinary vielbein]] $e$.

=--




### **II)** Spin-, String- and Fivebrane-structure
 {#SpinStringFivebraneStructures}

Above we have seen ([[pseudo-Riemannian metric|pseudo]]-)[[Riemannian metric|Riemannian structure]] given by lifts through the inclusion $\mathbf{B} O(n) \to \mathbf{B} GL(n)$. Now we consider further lifts, through the [[Whitehead tower]] of $\mathbf{B}O$. This encodes 
_[higher spin structures](spin+structure#Higher)_.

Where a _[[spin structure]]_ on [[spacetime]] is necessary to cancel a [[quantum anomaly]] of the [[spinning particle]]/[[superparticle]] [[sigma-model]], so the [[heterotic string|heterotic]] [[superstring]] requires, in the absence of a [[gauge field]], a "[higher spin structure](#spin+structure#Higher)", called a _[[string structure]]_.  Further up in dimension, _[[dual heterotic string theory]]_ in the absence of the gauge field involves a  _[[fivebrane structure]]_.

In the presence of a nontrivial [[gauge fields]], string structures are generalized to _[[twisted differential string structure|twisted string structure]]_, which in [[heterotic string theory]] are part of the _[[Green-Schwarz mechanism]]_. These we discuss [below](#TwistedK).


#### Whitehead tower
 {#WhiteheadTower}

The nature of higher spin structures is governed by what is called the _[[Whitehead tower]]_ of the [[homotopy type]] of the [[classifying space]] $B O$ of the [[orthogonal group]], where in each stage a [[homotopy group]] is removed _from below_. This is [[duality|dual]] to the _[[Postnikov tower]]_, where in each stage a homotopy group is added from above.

The [[homotopy groups]] of $B O$ start out as

| $k =$ | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|$\pi_k(B O) = $  | * | $\mathbb{Z}_2$ | $\mathbb{Z}_2$ | 0 | $\mathbb{Z}$ | 0 | 0 | 0 | $\mathbb{Z}$ |

The Whitehead tower of $B O$ starts out as

$$
  \array{
    & Whitehead tower
    \\
    &\vdots
    \\
    & B Fivebrane &\to& \cdots &\to& *
    \\
    & \downarrow && && \downarrow
    \\
    second frac Pontr. class & B String &\to& \cdots &\stackrel{\tfrac{1}{6}p_2}{\to}&  B^8 \mathbb{Z}
    &\to& * 
    \\
    & \downarrow && && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    first frac Pontr. class & B Spin && && &\stackrel{\tfrac{1}{2}p_1}{\to}& B^4 \mathbb{Z} &\to & *

    \mathbf{B}^2 \mathbb{Z}_2
    &\to&

    \\

    &\to&
    \tau_{\leq 4 } B O
    &\to&
    \tau_{\leq 2 } B O
    &\stackrel{w_1}{\to}&
    \tau_{\leq 1 } B O
    \simeq
    B \mathbb{Z}_2
    &
    Postnikov  tower
    \\
    & \downarrow
    \\
    & B GL(n)
  }
$$

where 

* the stages are the [[deloopings]] of

  ...
  $\to$
  [[fivebrane group]]
  $\to$
  [[string group]]
  $\to$
  [[spin group]]
  $\to$
  [[special orthogonal group]]
  $\to$
  [[orthogonal group]]

* the [[obstruction]] classes are the [[universal characteristic classes]]

  * [[first Stiefel-Whitney class]] $w_1$

  * [[second Stiefel-Whitney class]] $w_2$

  * [[Pontryagin class|first fractional Pontryagin class]] $\tfrac{1}{2}p_1$

  * [[Pontryagin class|second fractional Pontryagin class]] $\tfrac{1}{6}p_2$

* every possible square in the above is a [[homotopy pullback]] square (using the [[pasting law]]).

For instance $w_2$ can be identified as such by representing $B O \to \tau_{\leq 2} B O \simeq BO/_{\sim_n}$ by a [[Kan fibration]] (see at [[Postnikov tower]]) between [[Kan complexes]] so that then the [[homotopy pullback]] (as discussed there) is given by an ordinary pullback. Since $sSet$ is a [[simplicial model category]], $sSet(S^2,-)$ can be applied and preserves the pullback as well as the homotopy pullback, hence sends $ B O \to \tau_{\leq 2} B O$ to an isomorphism on connected components. This identifies  $B SO \to B^2 \mathbb{Z}$ as being an [[isomorphism]] on the second [[homotopy group]]. Therefore, by the [[Hurewicz theorem]], it is also an isomorphism on the [[cohomology group]] $H^2(-,\mathbb{Z}_2)$. Analogously for the other characteristic maps.

In summary, more concisely, the tower is

$$
  \array{
    \vdots
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    B Fivebrane
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    B String &\stackrel{\tfrac{1}{6}p_2}{\to}& B^7 U(1) & \simeq B^8 \mathbb{Z}
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    B Spin &\stackrel{\tfrac{1}{2}p_1}{\to}& B^3 U(1) & \simeq B^4 \mathbb{Z}
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    B SO &\stackrel{w_2}{\to}& B^2 \mathbb{Z}_2
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    B O &\stackrel{w_1}{\to}& B \mathbb{Z}_2
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    \\
    B GL
  }
  \,,
$$

where each "hook" is a [[fiber sequence]].

The [[universal property]] of [[homotopy pullbacks]] says that

* the [[obstruction]] to lifting an [[orthogonal structure]] $T X : X \to B O$ to an [[orientation]] structure is the homotopy class $[w_1(T X)] \in H^1(B O, \mathbb{Z}_2)$ of $w_1(T X) : X \stackrel{T X}{\to} B O \stackrel{w_1}{\to} B \mathbb{Z}_2$, the [[first Stiefel-Whitney class]];

* the [[obstruction]] to lifting an [[orientation]] structure $T X : X \to B SO$ to an [[spin structure]] is the [[second Stiefel-Whitney class]] $w_2(T X) : X \stackrel{}{\to} B S \stackrel{w_2}{\to} B^2 \mathbb{Z}_2$;

* the [[obstruction]] to lifting a [[spin structure]] $X \to B Spin$ to an [[string structure]] is the [[first fractional Pontryagin class]];

* the [[obstruction]] to lifting a [[string structure]] $X \to B String$ to a [[fivebrane structure]] is the [[second fractional Pontryagin class]].


#### Necessity of smooth refinement
 {#NecessityOfSmoothRefinement}

We will below consider a _smooth refinement_ of the above Whitehead tower. Before we do so, here a few words on why we need to do this.

One way to state the general problem is:

_The [[classifying space]] of, say, the [[spin group]] is **not** a _[[fine moduli space]]_. 

Because, while homotopy classes $Maps(X, B Spin)_\sim$ of maps $X \to B Spin$ are in bijection with equivalence classes of [[spin bundles]] on $X$, the homotopy classes $Maps(X, \Omega B Spin)_\sim = Maps(X, Spin)_\sim$ of [[homotopies]] from the trivial map $X \to * \to B Spin$ are _not_ in general in bijection with the [[gauge transformations]] of the trivial spin bundle: the latter form the set of [[smooth functions]] $C^\infty(X,Spin)$, not just the homotopy classes of these.

The problems induced by this problem include the following

* $Maps(X, B(-))_\sim$ does not give the right [[BRST-complex]]; hence speaking about [[gauge theory]] in terms of just bare (as opposed to geometric) [[homotopy theory]] does not yield an admissible starting point for [[quantization]] (by [[BV-BRST formalism]]).

* $Maps(X, B(-))_\sim$ cannot distinguish a group from its [[maximal compact subgroup]], such as $O \hookrightarrow GL_n$, and hence cannot see [[vielbeins]], not [[generalized vielbeins]], not [[exceptional generalized geometry]]:

  in terms of classifying spaces the entire discussion [of vielbein fields above](#VielbeinFields) would collapse;

* higher analogs of this problem include for instance that $Maps(X, B(-))_\sim$ cannot distinguish over 10-dimensional spacetime $X$ an [[E8]]-[[gauge field]] from a [[NS5-brane]] [[magnetic charge]];

* etc.

These problems are all fixed by refining the [[classifying space]] $B Spin \in \infty Grpd$ to the [[smooth infinity-groupoid|smooth]] [[moduli stack]] $\mathbf{B} Spin \in Smooth \infty Grpd$, and similarly for the other cases.



#### Smooth refinement
 {#SmoothRefinement}

We considered [above](#SmoothModuliStacks) the smooth refinement of the [[classifying space]] $B G$ for $G$ a [[Lie group]] to a [[smooth infinity-groupoid|smooth]] [[moduli stack]] $\mathbf{B}G$. While that works well, one can see on general grounds that this cannot provide a smooth refinement of the higher stages of the Whitehead tower, if one asks the refinement to preserve [[obstruction]] theory. The problem is that a smooth stack is necessarily a smooth [[homotopy n-type|homotopy 1-type]] (even if its [[geometric realization]] is a higher type! see below), while the higher stages of the smooth Whitehead tower need to be smooth [[homotopy n-types]]/[[n-groupoids]] for higher $n$.


But there is an evident refinement of the above discussion to such _smooth $n$-types_. 

To that end we first need a good model for bare homotopy types. One observes that the [[nerve]] functor embeds [[groupoids]] into [[Kan complexes|Kan]] [[simplicial sets]], as precisley those which are [[coskeleton|2-coskeletal]], meaning that only their 0-cells and 1-cells are non-trivial. Accordingly, a [[Kan complex]] which is [[coskeleton|(n+1)-coskeletal]] may be regarded as an _[[n-groupoid]]_ modelling a [[homotopy n-type]], and hence a general Kan complex as an _[[∞-groupoid]]_.

A morphism between groupoids $X \to Y$ is an [[equivalence of groupoids]] precisely if it is an [[essentially surjective functor]] and a [[full and faithful functor]].  This is equivalent to it inducing an [[isomorphism]] on [[isomorphism]] classes / connected components, and on [[automorphism groups]]. This in turn is equivalent to it inducing an isomorphism on the 0th and the first [[homotopy groups]] $\pi_0$ and $\pi_1$.

Accordingly, we say that a [[homotopy equivalence]] between [[Kan complexes]] is a morphism $X \to Y$ which induces an isomorphism on all [[homotopy groups]]. These can be defined for general [[simplicial sets]], and we say a morphism between these is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]] if it induces such isomorphisms.

Write  

$$
  \infty Groupoids \simeq SimplicialSets[ \{ weak\;homotopy\;equivalences\}^{-1} ]
$$

for the [[homotopy theory]] obtained by [[simplicial localization|localization]] at the weak homotopy equivalences: [[∞-groupoids]].


A [[topological space]] $X$ defines a Kan complex/ [[∞-groupoid]] by the [[singular simplicial complex]] construction $Sing X$, and this establishes an [[homotopy hypothesis|equivalence between]] the [[homotopy theory]] of topological spaces and simplicial sets

$$
  Top
   \stackrel{\stackrel{{\vert-\vert}}{\leftarrow}}{
     \underoverset{\simeq}{Sing}{\to}
   }
  sSet
  \,.
$$

In view of this, the [above](#WhiteheadTower) [[Whitehead tower]] can be understood entirely as taking place in Kan complexes.

For instance for $A$ an [[abelian group]], the [[2-groupoid]]

$$
  \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)_{disc}
  = 
  \left\{
    \array{
       && \to
       \\
       & \nearrow && \searrow
       \\
       *
       &&\Downarrow^{a \in A}&&
       *
       \\
       & \searrow && \nearrow
       \\
       && \to
    }
  \right\}
$$

corresponds to the [[Eilenberg-MacLane space]] $K(A,2)$.

More generally, for each [[chain complex]] $A_\bullet$ of [[abelian groups]] the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] provides a Kan complex $\Xi(A_\bullet)$ whose [[simplicial homotopy groups]] are the [[chain homology]] groups of $A_\bullet$. A [[quasi-isomorphism]] $A_\bullet \to B_\bullet$ is sent to a weak homotopy equivalence $\Xi(A_\bullet) \to \Xi(B_\bullet)$. In this sense [[∞Grpd]] is a [[non-abelian cohomology|non-abelian]] generalization of chain complexes with quasi-isomorphisms inverted.

Using this, we can easily state the generalization of the definition of smooth stacks from above: we obtain a [[homotopy theory]] of _[[smooth ∞-groupoid|smooth ∞-stacks]]_ $\mathbf{H} \coloneqq $ _[[Smooth∞Grpd]]_ by considering simplicial sets parameterized over smooth manifolds and forcing [[stalk]]wise weak homotopy equivalences to become homotopy equivalences

$$
  \mathbf{H} \coloneqq Func(SmthMfd^{op}, sSet)[\{stalkwise\, w.h.e.\}^{-1}]
  \,.
$$

For instance there is the smooth 2-stack

$$
  \mathbf{B}^2 U(1) \in \mathbf{H}
$$

given by assigning to each test space $U$ the [[Eilenberg-MacLane space]] on the (discrete) abelian group of smooth functions $U \to U(1)$

$$
  \mathbf{B}^2 U(1) 
    : 
   U \mapsto 
   K(  C^\infty(U, U(1)), 2)
   = 
   \left\{
    \array{
       && \to
       \\
       & \nearrow && \searrow
       \\
       *
       &&\Downarrow^{c \in C^\infty(U,U(1))}&&
       *
       \\
       & \searrow && \nearrow
       \\
       && \to
    }
  \right\}
  \,.
$$

A morphism $X \to \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)$ in $\mathbf{H}$ is equivalently a zig-zag $X \stackrel{\simeq}{\leftarrow} C(\{U_i\}) \stackrel{\lambda}{\to} \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)$ through the [[Cech nerve]]. This now defines in degree 2 

$$
  \array{
    && (x,j)
    \\
    & \nearrow &\Downarrow& \searrow
    \\
    (x,1) &&\to&& (x,k)
  }
  \;\;\;
  \mapsto
  \;\;\;
  \array{
    && *
    \\
    & \nearrow &\Downarrow^{\lambda_{i j k})(x}& \searrow
    \\
    * &&\to&& *
  }
$$

smooth functions $\lambda$ on triple overlaps 

$$
  \lambda_{i j k } 
    : 
  U_i \cap U_j \cap U_k \to U(1)
$$


and the condition on quadruple overlaps $U_i \cap U_j \cap U_k \cap U_l$ says that they satisfy

$$
  \lambda_{i j k}
  \lambda_{i k l}
   =
  \lambda_{j k l}
  \lambda_{i j k}
  \,.
$$

This now identifies $(\lamda_{i j k})$ with a cocycle in degree-2 [[Cech cohomology]]

$$
  [(\lambda_{i j k})] \in H^2_{smooth}(X, U(1)) 
  \,.
$$

This classifies a smooth [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle 2-bundle]] / [[bundle gerbe]].

Generally we have

$$
  \pi_0 \mathbf{H}(X, \mathbf{B}^n U(1))
  \simeq
  H^n_{smooth}(X, U(1))
$$

and for $X$ a smooth manifold

$$
  \cdots \simeq H^{n+1}(X, \mathbb{Z})
  \,.
$$

So apparently the smooth $n$-stack $\mathbf{B}^n U(1)$ is a _smooth refinement_ of the [[Eilenberg-MacLane space]] $K(\mathbb{Z},n+1)$.

This is made precise as follows.

**Theorem** There is an [[(∞,1)-functor]]

$$
  {\vert-\vert}
  : 
  Smooth\infty Grpd
   \stackrel{\Pi}{\to}
  \infty Grpd
   \stackrel{{\vert-\vert}}{\to}
  Top
$$

which is [[left adjoint|left]] [[adjoint (∞,1)-functor|adjoint]] to the functor that assigns [[constant ∞-stacks]].
We call this the _[[geometric realization]]_ of [[smooth ∞-groupoids]].

We say that a choice of lift of a diagram of bare homotopy types through geometric realization is a smooth _geomtric refinement_.

For instance one finds

$$
  {\vert \mathbf{B}^n U(1) \vert}
  \simeq
  B^n U(1)\simeq B^{n+1}\mathbb{Z} \simeq K(\mathbb{Z}, n+1)
$$

and hence $\mathbf{B}^n U(1)$ is a smooth geometric refinement of $K(\mathbb{Z}, n+1)$.

We now apply this to the above Whitehead tower.

#### Smooth Whitehead tower
 {#SmoothWhitehead}

We state the smooth refinement of the above Whitehead tower and then explain some aspects of how it is constructed.

**Theorem** There is a smooth geometric refinement of the [above Whitehead tower](#WhiteheadTower) of [[homotopy type|bare homotopy types]] to a tower of [[smooth infinity-groupoid|smooth homotopy types]]/[[smooth ∞-stacks]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    \vdots
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbf{B} Fivebrane
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbf{B} String &\stackrel{\tfrac{1}{6}\mathbf{p}_2}{\to}& \mathbf{B}^7 U(1) 
    \\

  \,.
$$

where 

* $\mathbf{B}^{n+1} U(1)$ is the [[delooping]] of the smooth [[circle n-group]], the smooth moduli $(n+1)$-stack of smooth [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle n-bundles]];

* $\mathbf{B} String$ is the [[delooping]] of the [[smooth string 2-group]], the moduli 2-stack of smooth $String$-[[principal 2-bundles]]

* $\mathbf{B}Fivebrane$ is the delooping of the [[smooth fivebrane 6-group]], the smooth moduli 6-stack of smooth fivebrane-[[principal infinity-bundle|principal 6-bundles]].

and where 

* $\tfrac{1}{2} \mathbf{p}_1$ classifies the universal [[Chern-Simons circle 3-bundle]] and hence identifies it with $\mathbf{B}String \to \mathbf{B}Spin$;

* $\tfrac{1}{6} \mathbf{p}_2$ classifies the universal [[Chern-Simons circle 7-bundle]] and hence identifies it with $\mathbf{B}Fivebrane \to \mathbf{B}String$.

This is constructed using essentially the following three tools for presenting presheaves of higher groupoids:

1. The [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] 

   $$
     \Xi : Ch_{\geq 0} \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} sAb \to sSet
   $$ 

   and its prolongation to presheaves

   $$
     \Xi : [SmthMfd^{op}, Ch_{\geq 0}) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} [SmthMfd^{op},sAb] \to [SmthMfd^{op},sSet]
   $$ 

   allows to use presheaves of [[chain complexes]] of [[abelian groups]] to present presheaves of strict $\infty$-groupoids with strict abelian group structure. 

   For instance
  
   $$
     \mathbf{B}^n U(1) \simeq \Xi( C^\infty(-,U(1))[n] )
   $$

   is equivalent to the image under the DK correspondence of the sheaf of chain complexes which is concentrated in degree $n$ on the group of $U(1)$-valued functions.

1. Some [nonabelian generalizations](Dold-Kan+correspondence#StatementGeneral) of the Dold-Kan correspondence allow to use chain complexes of not entirely abelian groups -- _[[crossed complexes]]_ -- to present a few more classes of $\infty$-groupoids. Notably nonabelian 2-term chain complexes, 

   $$
     G_1 \stackrel{\delta}{\to} G_0  
   $$

   called _[[crossed modules]]_, due to them being equipped with a compatible action $G_0 \to Aut(G_1)$, serve to equivalently present [[strict 2-groups]].

   For instance, one way to construct the [[string 2-group]] $String$ above is via the crossed module $(\hat \Omega_* Spin \to P_* Spin)$ induced from the [[Kac-Moody central extension]] of the [[loop group]] of $Spin$.

   For a given crossed module, the corresponding moduli 2-stack $\mathbf{B}(G_1 \stackrel{\delta}{\to} G_0)$ has [[2-morphism|2-cells]] that look like

   $$
      \mathbf{B}(G_1 \to G_0)
      =
      \left\{
        \array{
          && *
          \\
          & {}^{\mathllap{g_1}}\nearrow &\Downarrow^{\mathrlap{h}}& \searrow^{\mathrlap{g_2}}
          \\
          * &&\underset{\delta(h) g_2 g_1}{\to}&&
        }
        \;\;
        |
        \;\;
        g_1,g_2 \in G_0, h \in G_1
      \right\}
     \,.
   $$

1. The [[Lie integration]] $\tau_{\leq n} \exp(\mathfrak{g})$ of an [[L-∞ algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ yields the corresponding [[smooth ∞-group]] $G$. For instance the [[string 2-group]] $String$ above is also equivalently given by $\mathbf{B} String \simeq \tau_{\leq 2} \exp(\mathfrak{string})$, where $\mathfrak{string}$ is the [[string Lie 2-algebra]].

Using these tools, the stages of the above smooth Whitehead tower are constructed as follows:

* the morphism $\mathbf{w}_1 : \mathbf{B}O \to \mathbf{B} \mathbb{Z}_2$ is directly induced from the canonical Lie group homomorphism $O \to \mathbb{Z}_2$.

* the morphism $\mathbf{w}_2 : \mathbf{B}SO \to \mathbf{B}^2 \mathbb{Z}_2$ in $\mathbf{H}$ is presented by the [[infinity-anafunctor|zig-zag]] of crossed modules

  $$
    \array{
       (\mathbb{Z}_2 \to Spin) &\stackrel{}{\to}& (\mathbb{Z}_2 \to 1)
       \\
       {}^{\mathllap{\simeq}}\downarrow
       \\
       (1 \to SO)
    }
  $$

* the morphism $\tfrac{1}{2}\mathbf{p}_1 : \mathbf{B}Spin \to \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)$ is constructed ([FSSa](#FSSa)) as the [[Lie integration]] of the canonical [[infinity-Lie algebra cohomology|L-∞ 3-cocylce]] $\mathbf{B}\mu_3 : \mathbf{B}\mathfrak{so} \to \mathbf{B}^3 \mathbb{R}$.
  
* similarly $\tfrac{1}{6}\mathbf{p}_2 \simeq \exp(\mu_7)$ is the Lie integration of a canonical 7-cocycle $\mathbf{B}\mu_7 : \mathbf{B}\mathfrak{string} \to \mathbf{B}^7 \mathbb{R}$ ([FSSa](#FSSa)).


#### Differential refinement

While the [above](#SmoothWhitehead) smooth refinement of the Whitehead tower already improves on the [bare Whitehead tower](#WhiteheadTower) by remembering the correct spaces of [[gauge transformations]], it still only sees "[[instanton]] sectors" of [[gauge fields]] and [[higher gauge fields]], namely the underlying [[principal ∞-bundles]]. We add now the refinement from _smooth cohomology_ to [[differential cohomology]] such as to encode the actual [[higher gauge fields]] themselves. This differential cohomology in turn is naturally available in terms of _curvature twisted flat cohomology_ or equivalently _curvature-twisted [[local systems]]_.

$\,$

In order to get a feeling for what differential refinements of higher moduli stacks are going to be like, recall two structures that we have already seen above:

1. For $G$ a [[Lie group]] the smooth moduli stack of smooth $G$-[[principal connections]] from [above](#SpinConnection) is presented by

   $$
     \mathbf{B}G_{conn}
     =
     (C^\infty(-,G) \times \Omega^1(-, \mathfrak{g}) 
        \stackrel{\overset{}{\to}}{\underset{}{\to}}
      \Omega^1(-, \mathfrak{g}))
     =
     \left\{
        A \stackrel{g}{\to} (g^{-1} A g + g^{-1} d g)
        |
        A \in \Omega^1(-,\mathfrak{g}),
        g \in C^\infty(-,G)
     \right\}
     \,.
   $$

   In the special case that $G = U(1)$ is abelian, this is the image under the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] of the length 1 complex of sheaves of abelian groups

   $$
     \mathbf{B}U(1)_{conn} = [C^\infty(-) \stackrel{d_{dR}}{\to} \Omega^1(-)]
      \,.
   $$

1. The smooth $n$-stack $\mathbf{B}^n U(1)$ is realized as the image under the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] by the chain complex of sheaves $C^\infty(-,U(1))$

   $$
     \mathbf{B}^n U(1)
     \simeq
     [
       C^\infty(-,U(1))
       \to 0
       \to \cdots 
       \to 0
     ]
     \,.
   $$

From the look of these expressions there is already a plausible candidate for the differential refinement $\mathbf{B}^n U(1)_{conn}$, the moduli $n$-stack of [[circle n-bundles with connection]] -- it should be the _[[Deligne complex]]_:

$$
  \mathbf{B}^{n} U(1)_{conn}
    =
  \left[
  C^\infty(-,U(1))
  \stackrel{d_{dR} log}{\to}
  \Omega^1(-)
  \stackrel{d_{dR}}{\to}
  \Omega^2(-)
  \stackrel{d_{dR}}{\to}
  \cdots
  \stackrel{d_{dR}}{\to}
  \Omega^n(- )
  \right]
  \,.  
$$

For instance a cocycle $X \to \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)_{conn}$ in $\mathbf{H}$ is in $Funct(SmthMfd^{op}, sSet)$ and relative to a [[good open cover]] given by a morphism $C(\{U_i\}) \to \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)_{conn}$, which is

* on each $U_i$ a [[connection on a 2-bundle|connection 2-form]] $B_i \in \Omega^2(U_i)$;

* on each $U_i \cap U_j$ a 1-form $A_{i j} \in \Omega^1(U_i \cap U_j)$ such that $B_j - B_i = d_{dR} A_{i j} $;

* on each $U_i \cap U_j \cap U_k$ a smooth functor $\phi_{i j k} \in C^\infty(U_i \cap U_j \cap U_k, U(1))$ such that $A_{i j} + A_{j k} - A_{i k} = d_{dR} log \phi_{i j k}$ and such that on each $U_i \cap U_j \cap U_k \cap U_l$ the equation $\phi_{i j k} \phi_{i k l} = \phi_{i j l} \phi_{j k l}$ holds.

Tthe [[B-field]] on [[spacetime]] is (in the absence of various possible twists, to be discussed), such a cocycle $X \to \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)_{conn}$; and the [[C-field]] (similarly in the absence of possible twists, to be discussed below) is given by a morphism $X \to \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)_{conn}$.


Such cocycles in [[Deligne complex|Deligne]] [[hypercohomology]] define classes in _[[ordinary differential cohomology]]_ $H_{diff}^{n+1}(X)$:


$$
  H_{diff}^{n+1}(X)   
   = 
  \pi_0 \mathbf{H}(X, \mathbf{B}^n U(1)_{conn})
  \,.
$$


There is an evident morphism

$$
  \mathbf{B}^n U(1)_{conn} \to \mathbf{B}^n U(1)
$$

which [[forgetful functor|forgets]] the connection data. We say that $\mathbf{B}^n U(1)_{conn}$ is a _differential refinement_ of $\mathbf{B}^n U(1)$. 

We now want to construct a differential refinement of the above smooth Whitehead tower, hence of the smooth [[universal characteristic classes]] appearing in it. To do so, we now first provide a more conceptual way to think of $\mathbf{B}^n U(1)_{conn}$, a way to obtain this more abstractly from fundamental principles.

The key is that the [[(∞,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$ of [[smooth ∞-groupoids|smooth ∞-stacks]] comes with a canonical notion of _[[local system]]_ or _[[connection on an ∞-bundle|flat ∞-connection]]_, and that we can _twist_ this to find a notion of [[curvature]]-twisted and hence non-flat [[connection on an ∞-bundle|∞-connection]]. The notion of local systems is induced from two basic derived adjoint functors that exist on $\mathbf{H}$

$$
  \mathbf{H}
   \stackrel{\overset{Disc}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma}{\to}}
  \infty Grpd
  \,,
$$

where $\Gamma$ evaluates a presheaf on the point, and where $Disc$ sends an $\infty$-groupoid to the presheaf constant on that value. We form the composite 

$$
  \flat : \mathbf{H} \stackrel{\Gamma}{\to} \infty Grpd \stackrel{Disc}{\to} \mathbf{H}
  \,,
$$

to be pronounced "flat": for $A \in \mathbf{H}$ a smooth homotopy type, we call $\flat A$ the corresponding _flat coefficient_ object. 

For instance if $G$ is a [[Lie group]], then $\Gamma \mathbf{B}G \simeq B (G_{disc}) = K(G_{disc}, 1)$, and so a morphism $X \to \flat \mathbf{B}G$ is equivalently a cocycle $X \to \mathbf{B} (G_{disc})$, hence a $G_{disc}$-covering space, hence a flat $G$-[[principal connection]].


Generally, we say that a morphism

$$
  X \to \flat A
$$

is an _$A$-[[local system]]_ or _$A$-valued [flat ∞-connection](cohesive+%28infinity,1%29-topos+--+structures#FlatDifferentialCohomology)_ on $X$.

There is a canonical forgetful morphism $u : \flat A \to A$ which forgets the flat connection: this is the $(\Disc \dashv \Gamma)$-[[counit of an adjunction|counit]]. Consider the coefficient object of those flat $G$-connections whose underlying $\mathbf{B}G$-[[principal ∞-bundle]] is trivial

$$
  \flat_{dR} \mathbf{B}G
  \coloneqq
  \left\{
    \nabla \in \flat \mathbf{B}G | (u(\nabla) \simeq * )
  \right\}
  \,.
$$

From the example of ordinary [[principal connections]] it is familiar that flat $G$-connections on trivial $G$-principal bundles are equivalently flat [[Lie algebra valued differential forms]].
Below we will see that for general [[smooth ∞-groups]] $G$, morphisms $X \to \flat_{dR} \mathbf{B}G$ are $\mathfrak{g}$-[[infinity-Lie algebroid-valued differential form|∞-Lie algebra valued differential forms]] on $X$.

Reading the above expression in [[homotopy type theory]], its [[categorical semantics]] is  the [[homotopy fiber]] of the counit

$$
  \flat_{dR} \mathbf{B}G \coloneqq * \times_{\mathbf{B}G} \flat \mathbf{B}G
  \,.
$$

By this construction and applying the [[pasting law]], there is a canonical morphism $\theta : G \to \flat_{dR} \mathbf{B}G$, hence a canonical $\mathfrak{g}$-valued form on any cohesive [[∞-group]] $G$: this identifies as the canonical _[[Maurer-Cartan form]]_ on the [[∞-group]] $G$.

$$
  \array{
    G &\to& *
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\theta}}\downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \flat_{dR} \mathbf{B}G &\to& \flat \mathbf{B}G
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{u}}
    \\
    * &\to& \mathbf{B}G
  }
  \,.
$$

For the special class of cases $G = \mathbf{B}^n U(1)$ the [[circle n-group|circle (n+1)-group]] we call $curv_{\mathbf{B}^n U(1)}  \coloneqq  \mathbf{B}^n U(1) \to \flat_{dR} \mathbf{B}^{n+1} U(1)$ the _universal [[curvature]] class_ in degree $(n+1)$. 

Due to the existence of the further functor $\Pi : \mathbf{H} \to \infty Grpd$ discussed [above](#SmoothWhitehead) it follows that $\flat : \mathbf{H} \to \infty Grpd$ is a [[right adjoint]] and hence commutes with homotopy pullback. This in turn implies that by forming one more homotopy fiber above, we obtain the following differential version of a universal coefficient bundle:

$$
  \array{
    \flat \mathbf{B}^n U(1) &\to& \mathbf{B}^n U(1)
    \\
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{curv}}
    \\
    && \flat_{dR} \mathbf{B}^{n+1} U(1)
  }
  \,.
$$

By the general concept of [[twisted cohomology]], we see that this defines a notion of _curvature twisted flat differential cohomology_ -- hence of differential cohomology. 

Specifically, for $F_X : X \to \Omega^{n+1}_{cl}(-)$ a closed [[differential form]] on $X$, a [[cocycle]] in $F_X$-[[twisted cohomology|twisted]] $\mathbf{curv}$-cohomology is equivalently a [[circle n-bundle with connection]] with that curvature

$$
  \array{
    X &&\stackrel{}{\to}&& \mathbf{B}^n U(1)
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{F}}\searrow &\swArrow_{\nabla}& \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\mathbf{curv}}}
    \\
    && \flat_{dR} \mathbf{B}^{n+1} U(1)_{conn}
  }
  \;\;
  \in
  \mathbf{H}_{\flat \mathbf{B}^{n+1}U(1)}(F_X, \mathbf{curv})
  \,.
$$

For varying $F$, the $\mathbf{curv}$-[[twisted cohomology]] in $\mathbf{H}$ identifies with [[ordinary differential cohomology]]: the [[homotopy pullback]] $\mathbf{B}^n U(1)_{conn}$ in

$$
  \array{
    \mathbf{B}^n U(1)_{conn} &\to& \Omega^{n+1}_{cl}(-)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbf{B}^n U(1) &\stackrel{curv}{\to}& \mathbf{B}^{n+1} U(1)_{conn}
  }
$$

is presented, under the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]],  by the [[Deligne complex]], discussed above. This exhibits ordinary differential cohomology as the curvature-twisted flat cohomology


$$
  \mathbf{H}_{diff}(X, \mathbf{B}^n U(1))
  =
  \mathbf{curv}Struc_{\Omega^{n+1}}(X)
  \,.
$$

Using this geometric-homotopy-type theoretic description of ordinary differential cohomology, we obtain now a natural notion of differential refinement of smooth [[universal characteristic classes]]
$\mathbf{c} : \mathbf{B}G \to \mathbf{B}^{n+1} U(1)$. We say that a _differential refinement_ of $\mathbf{c}$ is a morphism $\hat \mathbf{c}$ fitting into a diagram 

$$
  \array{
    \flat \mathbf{B}G &\stackrel{\flat \mathbf{c}}{\to}&
    \flat \mathbf{B}^{n+1} U(1)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow 
    \\
    \mathbf{B}G_{conn} &\stackrel{\hat \mathbf{c}}{\to}& \mathbf{B}^{n+1} U(1)_{conn}

    \mathbf{B}G

  }
$$

that factors the [[natural transformation|naturality]] square of $\flat$ on $\mathbf{c}$.




#### Differential Whitehead tower

**Theorem** ([SSSa](#SSSa), [FSSa](#FSS)) There exists a smooth differential refinement of the [Whitehead tower of BO](#WhiteheadTower) as follows:


$$
  \array{
    \vdots
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbf{B} Fivebrane_{conn}
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbf{B} String_{conn} &\stackrel{\tfrac{1}{6}\hat \mathbf{p}_2}{\to}& \mathbf{B}^7 U(1)_{conn}

We indicate briefly how this is constructed.

### **III)** $Spin^c$-, $String^c$-, $Fivebrane^c$-structure 
 {#TwistedK}

In the [previous section](#SpinStringFivebraneStructures) we have considered higher differential structures originating in the [[orthogonal group]]. In applications to [[string theory]] these structures receive twists originating in the [[unitary group]] (or representations through the unitary group of groups like [[E8]]). (The orthogonal structures correspond to the field of [[gravity]], while the unitary structures correspond to [[gauge fields]].)

Accordingly, the [above Whitehead tower](#WhiteheadTower) of $\mathbf{B}O$ has stage-wise _[[unitary group|unitary]] twistings_. In the first stage this is given by the familiar [[spin^c]]-group, then there is a [[String^c 2-group]], etc.

After discussing some generalities of these higher unitary-twisted connected covers of the orthogonal group [below](#HigherUnitaryTwistedCovers) we then turn to discussing a list of twisted structures and their appearance in string theory:

| unitary-twisted higher orthogonal structure| role in string theory |
|--|--|
| [[twisted spin^c structure|twisted differential spin^c structure]] | [[Freed-Witten anomaly cancellation]] for [[type II string theory|type II strings]] on [[D-branes]]|
| [[supergravity C-field|twisted differential String^c-structure]] | flux quantization in [[11-dimensional supergravity|11d sugra]]/[[M-theory]] with [[M5-branes]] |
|  [[twisted differential string structure]] | [[Green-Schwarz mechanism]] in [[heterotic string theory]] |
|  [[twisted differential fivebrane structure]] | [[Green-Schwarz mechanism]] in [[dual heterotic string theory]] |



#### Higher unitary-twisted covers of $O$
 {#HigherUnitaryTwistedCovers}

The [[Lie group]] [[spin^c]] is traditionally defined by the formula

$$
  Spin^c \coloneqq Spin \times_{\mathbb{Z}_2} U(1) = (Spin \times U(1))/{\mathbb{Z}_2}
  \,,
$$

which denotes the [[quotient]] of the product $Spin \times U(1)$ by the [[diagonal]] [[action]] induced by the common canonical [[subgroup]] [[group of order 2|of order 2]].

For our purposes it is useful to think of this as follows. We have the $\mathbf{B}\mathbb{Z}_2$-[[associated infinity-bundle|higher fiber bundle]] classified by the smooth [[second Stiefel-Whitney class]]

$$
  \array{
    \mathbf{B} \mathbb{Z}_2 &\to& \mathbf{B} Spin
    \\
    && \downarrow
    \\
    && \mathbf{B} SO &\stackrel{\mathbf{w}_2}{\to}& \mathbf{B}^2 \mathbb{Z}
  }
$$

and we also have the [[associated infinity-bundle|higher fiber bundle]]

$$
  \array{
    \mathbf{B} U(1) &\stackrel{\cdot 2}{\to}& \mathbf{B} U(1)
    \\
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mathbf{c}_1 mod 2}}
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}\mathbb{Z}_2
  }
$$

which is $\mathbb{Z}_2$-[[associated infinity-bundle|associated]] to the [[universal principal bundle]] universal $\mathbb{Z}_2$-bundle.

One finds, using the presentation of these maps as discussed [above](#SmoothWhitehead), that $\mathbf{B}Spin^c$ is the corresponding [[associated infinity-bundle|associated bundle]], namely the [[homotopy pullback]]

$$
  \array{
    \mathbf{B}Spin^c &\to& \mathbf{B}U(1)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mathbf{c}_1 mod 2}}
    \\
    \mathbf{B} SO &\stackrel{\mathbf{w}_2}{\to}& \mathbf{B}^2 \mathbb{Z}_2
  }
  \,.
$$

Equivalently we may write this as a [[Mayer-Vietoris sequence]] and thus obtain the universal $\mathbf{B}Spin^c$-coefficient bundle over $\mathbf{B}^2 \mathbb{Z}$

$$
  \array{
    \mathbf{B}Spin^c &\to& \mathbf{B} (SO \times U(1))
    \\
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mathbf{w}_2 - \mathbf{c}_1 mod 2}}
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}^2 \mathbb{Z}_2
  }
$$

We may read this as saying:

_Where the moduli stack $\mathbf{B}Spin$_ is the homotopy fiber of the smooth second Stiefel-Whitney class $\mathbf{w}_2$, the moduli stack  $\mathbf{B}Spin^c$ is that homotopy fiber universally twisted by the smooth [[first Chern class]] $\mathbf{c}_1 mod 2$._

In the following we consider higher analogs of this, where homotopy fibers of "orthogonal classes" are twisted by "unitary classes".

In particular, one step higher in the [Whitehead tower of BO](#WhiteheadTower), we can twist the smooth [[first fractional Pontryagin class]] with the smooth [[second Chern class]] to obtain the [[delooping]] of the smooth [[String^c 2-group]]

$$
  \array{
    \mathbf{B} String^{\mathbf{c}_2} &\to& \mathbf{B}(Spin \times SU)
    \\
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\tfrac{1}{2}\mathbf{p}_1 - \mathbf{c}_2 }}
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)
  }
  \,.
$$

This controls the [[supergravity C-field]] in [[M-theory]]/[[11-dimensional supergravity]] as well as the [[Green-Schwarz mechanism]] in [[heterotic string theory]], discussed below.

Before we come to that we consider another variant, since that leads to the most familiar twisting, that of [[twisted K-theory]]. 


One finds that there is also a universal $\mathbf{B}Spin^c$-coefficient bundle over $\mathbf{B}^2 U(1)$, and this is given by the smooth third [[integral Stiefel-Whitney class]]:

$$
  \array{
    Spin^c &\to& \mathbf{B} SO
    \\
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mathbf{W}_3}}
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)
  }
  \,.
$$

Since that now lands in $\mathbf{B}^2 U(1)$, we can apply _one more_ unitary twist by a corresponding class. The canonical such class is the universal [[Dixmier-Douady class]] $\mathbf{dd}$ of (stable) [[projective unitary group|projective unitary]] bundles


$$
  \array{
    \mathbf{B}(Spin^c)^{\mathbf{dd}} &\to& \mathbf{B} ( SO \times PU )
    \\
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mathbf{W}_3 - \mathbf{dd}}}
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)
  }
  \,.
$$

This universal coefficient bundle controls the [[Freed-Witten anomaly cancellation]] in [[type II string theory]]. To which we now turn.



#### **a)** Twisted differential $Spin^c$-structure: Freed-Witten mechanism
 {#BFieldInK}

We discuss aspects of the twisted smooth cohomology involved
over [[D-branes]] in [[type II string theory]]: the [[Freed-Witten anomaly cancellation]] mechanism in terms of [[twisted K-theory]].



For each $n$, the [[central extension]] of Lie groups

$$
  U(1) \to U(n) \to PU(n)
$$

that exhibits the [[unitary group]] as a [[circle group]]-extension of the [[projective unitary group]] induces the corresponding morphism of smooth [[moduli stacks]]

$$
  \mathbf{B} U(1) \to \mathbf{B} U(n) \to \mathbf{B} PU(n)
  \,.
$$

This is part of a [[fiber sequence|long fiber sequence]] which continues to the right by a [[connecting homomorphism]] $\mathbf{dd}_n$

$$
  \mathbf{B} U(1) \to \mathbf{B} U(n) \to \mathbf{B} PU(n)
   \stackrel{\mathbf{dd}_n}{\to}
  \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)
$$

in $\mathbf{H}$. Here the last morphism is presented in simplicial presheaves by the zig-zag of sheaves of [[crossed modules]]

$$
  \array{
     [U(1) \to U(n)] &\to& [U(1) \to 1]   
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\simeq}}\downarrow
     \\
     PU(n)
  }
  \,.
$$

We have seen [above](#SmoothWhitehead) that a morphism $\phi : X \to \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)$ classifies a [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle 2-bundle]] encoded by a Cech 2-cocycle $(\phi_{i j k} : U_i \cap U_j \cap U_k \to U(1))$ . This means that the universal coefficient bundle

$$
  \array{
     \mathbf{B} U(n) &\to& \mathbf{B} PU(n)
     \\
     && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mathbf{dd}_n}}
     \\
     && \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)
  }
$$

induces a notion of unitary bundles that are _twisted_ by a 2-bundle.

Indeed, unwinding the definition one finds that a $\phi$-twisted $\mathbf{dd}_n$ cocycle

$$
  \array{
    X &&\stackrel{h}{\to}&& \mathbf{B} PU(n)
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{\phi}}\searrow &\swArrow_{\simeq}& \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\mathbf{dd}_n}}
    \\
    &&
    \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)
  }
$$

is, with respect to a resolution of $X$ a [[good open cover]] $\{U_i \to X\}$, given by maps $C(\{U_i\}) \to \mathbf{B}(U(1) \to U(n))$ whose components read

$$
  \left(
  \array{
      && (x,j)
      \\
      & \nearrow &\Downarrow& \searrow
      \\
     (x,i) &&\to&& (x,k)
  }
  \right)
  \;\;\;
  \mapsto
  \;\;\;  
  \left(
    \array{
       && *
       \\
       & {}^{\mathllap{h_{i j}(x)}}\nearrow 
         &\Downarrow^{\phi_{i j k}(x)}& 
  \searrow^{\mathrlap{h_{j k}}}
       \\
      * &&\underset{h_{i k}}{\to}&& *
   }    
  \right)
  \in 
  \mathbf{B}(U(1) \to U(n))
  \,.
$$

Hence these are collections of smooth $U(n)$-valued functions

$$
  (h_{i j} : U_i \cap U_j \to U(n))
$$

which satisfy on triple overlaps the equation

$$
  h_{i j} h_{j k} = h_{i k} \phi_{i j k}
  \,.
$$

If $\phi_{i j k}$ happens to be constant on the neutral element, then this is the condition for a cocycle in $H^1_{smooth}(X, U(n))$. So in general we say it is a _$\phi$-twisted_ such cocycle. And that $(h_{i j})$ classifies a  _$\phi$-[[twisted bundle|twisted unitary bundle]]_. 

In generalization of how unitary bundles constitute cocycles for [[K-theory]], these $\phi$-twisted unitary bundles constitute cocycles for [[twisted K-theory]].


For each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ there is a canonical inclusion $\mathbf{B} U(n) \to \mathbf{B} U(n+1)$, exhibiting the fact that a rank-$n$ complex vector bundle canonically induces a rank-$(n+1)$-bundle by added a trivial line bundle.

To get rid of the dependence on the rank $n$ -- to _stabilize_ the rank -- 
we may form the [[directed colimit]] of smooth moduli stacks

$$
  \mathbf{B}U \coloneqq \underset{\rightarrow_n}{\lim} \mathbf{B} U(n)
$$

$$
  \mathbf{B} PU \coloneqq \underset{\rightarrow_n}{\lim} \mathbf{B} PU(n)
  \,.
$$

On these we have the smooth universal class

$$
  \mathbf{dd} : \mathbf{B} PU \to \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)
  \,.
$$

Since the [[(∞,1)-topos]] [[Smooth∞Grpd]] has [[universal colimits]], it follows that there is a [[fiber sequence]]

$$
  \array{
    \mathbf{B}U &\to& \mathbf{B} PU
    \\
    && \downarrow^{\mathbf{dd}}
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)
  }
$$


exhibiting the moduli stack of smooth stable unitary bundles as the homotopy fiber of $\mathbf{dd}$.


**Proposition** The smooth stack $\mathbf{B} U$ is a smooth refinement of the [[classifying space]] $B U$ of reduced [[K-theory]]. Also, for $X$ a [[compact topological space|compact]] [[smooth manifold]] smooth $U$-principal bundles and smooth $U$-gauge transformations on $X$ are represented by ordinary $U(n)$-bundles for some finite $n$.

$$
  \mathbf{H}(X, \mathbf{B}U)
  \simeq
  \underset{\rightarrow_n}{\lim} \mathbf{H}(X, \mathbf{B} U(n))
  \,.
$$

Now we think of the manifold $X$ as a [[target space]] for the [[type II superstring]], hence assume it to be orientable and spin: $w_1(X) = 0 $ and $w_2(X) = 0$. Consider moreover a [[submanifold]]

$$
  \iota : Q \hookrightarrow X
  \,,
$$

to be thought of as the [[worldvolume]] of a [[D-brane]], which is also or orientable and spin.

Assume first that $Q$ also admits a [[spin^c structure]], hence that also the third [[integral Stiefel-Whitney class]] vanishes $W_3(Q) = 0$.

We can consider then a cocycle in the $\iota$-[[relative cohomology]] with coefficients in $\mathbf{dd}$, namely a diagram

$$
  \array{
    Q &\stackrel{\phi_{ga}}{\to}& \mathbf{B} PU 
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{i}}\downarrow 
      &\swArrow_\simeq& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mathbf{dd}}}
    \\
    X &\stackrel{\phi_B}{\to}& \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)
  }
  \;\;\;\;
   \leftrightarrow
  \;\;\;
  \array{
    Q &&\stackrel{\phi_{ga}}{\to}&& \mathbf{B} PU
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{\phi_B|_Q}}\searrow &\swArrow& \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\mathbf{dd}}}
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)
  }
$$

in $\mathbf{H}$.


This is 

1. a [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle 2-bundle]] $\phi_B : X \to \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)$ on [[spacetime]] $X$: the underlying bundle of the [[B-field]];

1. a projective unitary bundle $\phi_{ga}$ on $Q$, a [[Chan-Paton bundle]] on the D-brane;

* together with an identification of the restriction $\phi_{B}|_Q$ of the $B$-field to the $D$-brane with the [[obstruction]] $\mathbf{dd}(\phi_{ga})$ to lift $\phi_{ga}$ to a genuine unitary bundle.

In [[cohomology]] this says that 

$$
  [\mathbf{dd}(\phi_{ga})] = [\phi_B|_Q] \;\; \in H^3(Q)
  \,.
$$

This is the _[[Freed-Witten anomaly cancellation]] condition_ for $D$-branes with [[spin^c structure]].

More generally, if $Q$ does not necessarily have $Spin^c$-structure, we consider $\iota$-[[relative cohomology]] with coefficients in the universal coefficient bundle $\mathbf{dd} - \mathbf{W}_3$:

$$
  \array{
    Q &\stackrel{(T X, \phi_{ga})}{\to}& \mathbf{B} ( SO \times PU) 
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{i}}\downarrow 
      &\swArrow_\simeq& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mathbf{dd} - \mathbf{W}_3}}
    \\
    X &\stackrel{\phi_B}{\to}& \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)
  }
  \;\;\;\;
   \leftrightarrow
  \;\;\;
  \array{
    Q &&\stackrel{(T X, \phi_{ga})}{\to}&& \mathbf{B} (SO \times PU)
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{\phi_B|_Q}}\searrow &\swArrow_{\simeq}& \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\mathbf{dd}-\mathbf{W}_3}}
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)
  }
  \,.
$$

This now is equivalently a twisted Chan-Paton bundle and a $B$-field such that in cohomology

$$
  [\mathbf{dd}(\phi_{ga})] + [W_3(Q)] = [\phi_B|_Q] \;\;\; \in H^3(X, \mathbb{Z})
  \,.
$$

This is the [[Freed-Witten anomaly cancellation]] condition for general $Q$.

#### **b)** Twisted differential $String^{\mathbf{c}_2}$-structure: M-theory flux quantization
 {#SuGraFluxQuantization}

We discuss the twisted smooth cohomology of the
[[supergravity C-field]] in [[11-dimensional supergravity]]/[[M-theory]].
With the smooth and differential refinement of the 
Whitehead tower in hand, this proceeds essentially in higher analogy to the 
[previous example](#BFieldInK).

From the [[effective QFT]] of [[11-dimensional supergravity]] the bosonic massless field content consists locally of the [[graviton]] and a 3-form $C$. We have the following information on how a model of this field content must behave globally


1. Due to the existence of [[spinors]], the graviton must be part of a [[spin connection]]:

   $$
     \phi_{gr} : X \to \mathbf{B}Spin_{conn}
     \,.
   $$

1. Due to the coupling to the [[M2-brane]] the 3-form must lift to a well-dfined [[higher holonomy|3-holonomy]] and hence must globally be a [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle 3-bundle with connection]]

   $$
     \phi_C : X \to \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)_{conn}
     \,.
   $$

1. Due to the coupling to the [[M5-brane]], there is an auxiliary [[E8]]-bundle 

   $$
     \phi_{ga} : X \to \mathbf{B} E_8
   $$

   and these fields must satisfy what in string theory literature is called the _flux quantization condition_, and what in _[[Quadratic Functions in Geometry, Topology, and M-Theory|Hopkins-Singer 05]]_ is called an _[[differential integral Wu structure]]_, meaning that in [[cohomology]]

   $$
     [\phi_C]
     = 
     [\frac{1}{2}p_1(\phi_{gr})]
     +
     [2\mathbf{a}(\phi_{ga})]
     \;\;
     \in H^4(X, \mathbb{Z})
     \,.
   $$

(Depending on convention one may write "$2 \phi_C$" for "$\phi_C$" here, regarding the physical $C$-field as being "one half" of the differential cocycle $X \to \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)_conn$ above, see the remark [below (1.2)](arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/9609122v2.pdf#page=2) in [[Edward Witten|Witten]]'s [arXiv:hep-th/9609122](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9609122)).

A [[discrete infinity-groupoid|discrete]] 1-groupoid model satisfying these points has been by [[Dan Freed|Freed]]-[[Greg Moore|Moore]] and others (see the references [here](supergravity+C-field#References)). Using [[cohesive homotopy type theory]] and following ([FSSc](#FSSc)) we now obtain naturally a genuine [[moduli infinity-stack|smooth moduli 3-stack]] of such field configurations: the [[categorical semantics|interpretation]] of the evident expression

$$
  \mathbf{CField}(X)
   \coloneqq
    \left\{
      \phi_{gr}, \phi_{ga}, \phi_{C}
      |
      \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{p}_1(\phi_{gr})
      +
      2\mathbf{a}(\phi_{ga})
      \simeq
      \phi_C
  \right\}
$$

in [[homotopy type theory]] is (see [[HoTT methods for homotopy theorists]] for how this works) the smooth $\infty$-stack 
$\mathbf{CField} \in \mathbf{H}$ given as the 
[[homotopy pullback]] 

$$
  \array{
     \mathbf{CField} &\to& \mathbf{B} Spin_{conn} \times \mathbf{B}E_8
	 \\
	 \downarrow &\swArrow_{\simeq}& \downarrow^{\tfrac{1}{2}\mathbf{p}_1 + 2\mathbf{a}}
	 \\
	 \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)_{conn} &\stackrel{}{\to}& \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)
  }
  \,.
$$

On the right this has the universal coefficient bundle for $\mathbf{String}^{2\mathbf{a}}$ from [above](#HigherUnitaryTwistedCovers), and hence this identifies a [[gravity]]-[[supergravity C-field|C-field]] configuration as being (a partial differential refinement of) a $[\phi_C]$-twisted $String^{2\mathbf{a}}$-structure.



#### **c)** Twisted differential String-structure -- Green-Schwarz mechanism
 {#TwistedStringStructure}


By [[Hořava-Witten theory]], the 10-dimensional [[target space|target]] [[spacetime]] of the 
[[heterotic string]] may be understood as being a boundary 
(or rather $\mathbb{Z}_2$-[[orbifold]] fixed points, see [below](#HWCompactifications)) of the 11-dimensional
spacetime of [[11-dimensional supergravity|11d SuGra]]. 
Over this boundary 

1. the [[curvature]] 4-form $G_4(\phi_C)$ vanishes;

1. and the $E_8$-[[principal bundle]] picks up a [[connection on a bundle|connection]]. 

This means that the [above](#SuGraFluxQuantization) defining homotopy pullback for $\mathbf{CField}$ goes over
into the one that defines the differential refinement $String^{\mathbf{a}}_{conn'}$
of $String^{\mathbf{a}}$:

$$
  \array{
     \mathbf{B}String^{\mathbf{a}}_{conn'} 
       &\to& 
      \mathbf{B} Spin_{conn} \times \mathbf{B}(E_8 \times E_8)_{conn}
	 \\
	 \downarrow &{}^{\mathllap{\phi_B}}\swArrow_{\simeq}& 
         \downarrow^{\tfrac{1}{2}\hat \mathbf{p}_1  + \hat \mathbf{a}}
	 \\
	 \Omega^3_{cl}(-) & \stackrel{\phi_C}{\hookrightarrow} & \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)_{conn}
  }
  \,.
$$

On cohomology classes this means that 

$$
  [\tfrac{1}{2}p_1(\phi_{gr})] = [a(\phi_{ga})] \;\; \in H^4(X, \mathbb{Z})
  \,.
$$

This is the integral part of the [[Green-Schwarz mechanism]] for the [[heterotic string theory|heterotic string]]. 

Since this is now refined not just to cocycles, but to differential cocycles -- to $\mathrm{String}^{\mathbf{a}}$-[[connection on a 2-bundle|2-connections]], 
there is, locally over a cover $\{U_i \to X\}$, also an equation of differential 
forms that exhibits this in de Rham cohomology. 

A morphism $X \to String^{2\mathbf{a}}_{conn}$ classifies field content that is expressed with respect to a [[good open cover]] $\{U_i \to X\}$ in particular over single patches $U_i$ by  ([SSSa](#SSSa), [FSSa](#FSSa))

* the [[connection on a bundle|gauge connection]] $A_i \in \Omega^1(U_i, \mathfrak{e}_8 \oplus \mathfrak{e}_8)$;

* the [[spin connection]] $\omega_i \in \Omega^1(U_i, \mathfrak{so})$ (the field of [[gravity]] in [[first order formulation of gravity]]);

* the [[B-field]] $\phi_B \in \Omega^2(U_i)$;

which come with [[curvature]]/[[field strength]] forms

* $F_{A_i} = d_{dR} A_i + \tfrac{1}{2}[A_i \wedge A_i]$

* $F_{\omega_i} = d_{dR} \omega_i + \tfrac{1}{2}[\omega_i \wedge \omega_i]$;

* $H_i = d B_i + CS(\omega_i) - CS(A_i)$ ($B$-field strength shifted by the difference of the [[Chern-Simons forms]] of $A_i$ and $\omega_i$);

satisfying the (twisted) [[Bianchi identities]] ([SSS](spring)))

* $d_{dR} F_{A_i} + [A_i \wedge F_{A_i}] = 0$;

* $d_{dR} F_{\omega_i} + [\omega_i \wedge F_{\omega_i}] = 0$;

* $d_{dR} H = \langle F_\omega \wedge F_\omega \rangle  - \langle F_A \wedge F_A \rangle$

(together with more local cocycle components on higher overlaps). Notably the twisted Bianchi identity of $H$ exhibits the above cohomological identity in de Rham cocycles. 

These formulas characterize the
[[Green-Schwarz mechanism|Green-Schwarz anomaly cancellation conditions]] on the [[background gauge field]] content, that makes the heterotic string be well defined. Accordingly, $String^{\mathbf{a}}_{conn}$ is the [[smooth infinity-groupoid|smooth]] [[moduli infinity-stack|modul 2-stack]] of anomaly free heterotic background fields (in the massless bosonic sector).

Notice that if the twist $\tfrac{1}{2}\hat \mathbf{p_1}(\phi_{gr}) - \hat\mathbf{a}(\phi_{gau})$ happen to vanish (say because both the field of gravity and the gauge field are trivial), then the above homotopy pullback reduces to 

$$
  \array{
     \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)_{conn}
       &\to& 
      *
 	 \\
	 \downarrow &{}^{\mathllap{\phi_B}}\swArrow_{\simeq}&

  }
$$

and exhibits $\phi_B$ as a genuine [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle 2-bundle with connection]] (and its 3-form curvature $H$ with $\phi_C$.). Conversely, this shows how in the general situation $\phi_B$ is a _twisted_ circle 2-bundle, with the twist given by the "magnetic fivebrane current" $\tfrac{1}{2}\hat \mathbf{p}_1(\phi_{gr}) - \hat \mathbf{a}(\phi_{ga})$.

## General theory
 {#GeneralTheory}


We survey here some key aspects of a general theory of geometric twisted differential cohomology, following ([DCCT](#Schreiber)), in which the above examples find a formal home. This is meant as a reference for readers of the _[Examples](#Examples)_-section who wish to see pointers to formal details.

$\,$

We base the formulation of [[physics]]/[[string theory]] on the [[foundations]] of _[[homotopy type theory|homotopy-type theory]]_, [[categorical semantics|interpreted]] in _[[(∞,1)-toposes]]_. This provides a nicely natural and expressive language for the purpose of twisted smooth cohomology in string theory. 

The following table indicates the hierarchy of [[axioms]] that we invoke, the fragments of [[theory]] that can be [[categorical semantics|interpreted]] with these and the [[models]] that we need. Essentially all of the above discussion works in the model [[Smooth∞Grpd]]. A more encompassing treatment uses [[supergeometry]] and works in the model [[SmoothSuper∞Grpd]].

### Homotopy-type theory


Traditionally a _[[homotopy type]]_ is a [[topological space]] regarded up to [[weak homotopy equivalence]], hence equivalently an _[[∞-groupoid]]_. More generally, we think of parameterized homotopy types -- of _[[∞-stacks]]_ or _[[(∞,1)-sheaves]]_ -- as _geometric homotopy types_. The collection of such forms an _[[(∞,1)-topos]]_ $\mathbf{H}$. One regards [[(∞,1)-topos theory]] as part of [[homotopy theory]], and, more specifically, the [[internal language]] of $\mathbf{H}$ is a _[[homotopy type theory|homotopy-type theory]]_.

We discuss now some basic structures that are expressible in such bare homotopy-type theory. (The fundamentals are due to [[Charles Rezk|Rezk]] and [[Jacob Lurie|Lurie]], see _[[Higher Topos Theory]]_. We point out the perspective of [[twisted cohomology]] in slices and add some aspects about higher bundle theory from ([NSS](#NSS))). 

Where useful, we indicate some of the discussion in formal [[homotopy type theory]] [[syntax]], see _[[HoTT methods for homotopy theorists]]_ for more along such lines.


#### Cohomology

A [[group object in an (infinity,1)-category|group object]] in an [[(∞,1)-topos]] is a groupal [[A-∞ algebra|A-∞]]-homotopy type: an _[[∞-group]]_.


By [[looping and delooping]] there is an [[equivalence of (∞,1)-categories|equivalence]]

$$
  Grp(\mathbf{H})
   \stackrel{\overset{\Omega}{\leftarrow}}{\underoverset{\mathbf{B}}{\simeq}{\to}}
  \mathbf{H}_{\geq 1}^{*/}
$$

between group objects and [[pointed object|pointed]] 
[[n-connected object of an (∞,1)-topos|connected]] homotopy types.

+-- {: .num_remark #DeloopingInTypeTheory}
###### Remark

If $pt : \mathbf{B}G$ is the essentially uniqe point of the [[n-connected object of an (∞,1)-topos|connected]] type $\mathbf{B}G$, then the group type itself is simply

$$
  G \coloneqq \vdash (pt \simeq pt) : Type
  \,,
$$

the type of auto-equivalences of $pt$ in $\mathbf{B}G$.

=--

For $A$ a group object which admits an $n$-fold [[delooping]] $\mathbf{B}^n A$ and $X \in \mathbf{H}$ any object, we write

* $\mathbf{H}(X, \mathbf{B}^n A)$ for the space of degree-$n$ $A$-[[cocycles]] $c : X \to A$;

* $H^n(X,A) \coloneqq \pi_0 \mathbf{H}(X, \mathbf{B}^n A)$ for the degree-$n$ $A$-[[cohomology]] of $X$.


#### Principal bundles

For $G \in Grp(\mathbf{H})$, $G$-cocycles on $X$ have an equivalent geometric interpretation as $G$-[[principal ∞-bundles]]: these are types 

$$
  \array{
    P 
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    X
  }
$$

over $X$ equipped with a $G$-[[action]] $\rho : P \times G \to P$ over $X$ such that the [[(∞,1)-colimit|∞-quotient]] of the action is $X$.

**Theorem** There is an [[equivalence of (∞,1)-categories|equivalence]] between the [[∞-groupoid]] of $G$-principal bundles over $X$, and the cocycle $\infty$-groupoid of $G$-cohomology over $X$.

$$
  \mathbf{H}(X, \mathbf{B}G)
   \stackrel{\overset{\underset{\to}{\lim}}{\leftarrow}}{\underoverset{fib}{\simeq}{\to}}
  G Bund(X)    
$$

From left to righr the equivalence is established by sending a cocycle $X\to \mathbf{B}G$ to its [[homotopy fiber]].

([NSS](#NSS))


+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

With $G$ the type as in remark \ref{DeloopingInTypeTheory}, the principal bundle corresponding to a coycle $\phi : X \to \mathbf{B}G$ is

$$
  P 
   \;
    \coloneqq 
   \;
  x : X \vdash ( \phi(x)  \simeq  pt ) : Type
$$

And the action is 

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    & \rho : P \times G \to G
    \\
    & \;\;\coloneqq
    (( x : X; p : (\phi(x) \simeq pt)), g : (pt \simeq pt) )
    \mapsto
    (x : X; g \circ \phi)
  \end{aligned}
$$

#### Twisted cohomology
 {#TwistedCohomology}


For $\mathbf{H}$ an [[(∞,1)-topos]] and $\mathbf{B}G \in \mathbf{H}$, the collection of morphisms into $\mathbf{B}G$ is the [[slice (∞,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}_{/ \mathbf{B}G}$.

The [[cohomology]] in $\mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}G}$ is naturally interpreted as follows

1. a coefficient object $\mathbf{c} : E \to \mathbf{B}G$ is a _universal bundle of coefficients_;

1. a domain object $\phi : X \to \mathbf{B}G$ is a _twisting bundle_;

1. a [[cocycle]] 

   $$
     \array{
       X &&\stackrel{\sigma}{\to}&& E
       \\
       & {}_{\mathllap{\phi}}\searrow &\swArrow_{\simeq}& \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\mathbf{c}}}
       \\
       && \mathbf{B}G
     }
   $$ 

   is equivalently a [[section]] of the [[(∞,1)-pullback]] bundle $\phi^* E \to X$;

   $$
     \array{  
        && \phi^* E &\to & E
        \\
        &{}^{\mathllap{\sigma}}\nearrow& \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathbf{c}}
        \\
        X &\stackrel{id}{\to}& X &\stackrel{\phi}{\to}& \mathbf{B}G
     }
   $$

* the [[cohomology]] 

  $$
    \mathbf{c}Struc_{\phi}(X)
    \coloneqq
    \mathbf{c}(\phi)
    \coloneqq
    \mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}G}(\phi, \mathbf{c})
  $$

  is the $\phi$-[[twisted cohomology]] of $X$ (with coefficients in the [[homotopy fiber]] $F$ of $\mathbf{c}$).

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

In the [[syntax]] of [[homotopy type theory]] the type of twisted cocycles is

$$
  [\phi, \mathbf{c}]
   \coloneqq
  \vdash \prod_{b \in \mathbf{B}G} (X(b) \to E(b)) : Type
  \;\;
  =
  \;\;
  \vdash \prod_{x : X} E(\phi(x)) : Type
$$

(see [here](http://www.ncatlab.org/nlab/show/locally%20cartesian%20closed%20category#RelationCartesianClosureBaseChangeInTypeTheory)).

While on the right this expresses the collection of sections of the pullback bundle, the left hand side expresses explicitly a $\mathbf{B}G$-parameterized collection of cocycles $X(b) \to E(b)$.

=--

#### Associated and twisted bundles

For

$$
  \array{
    \mathbf{B}A &\to& \mathbf{B}\hat G
    \\
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mathbf{c}}}
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}G
  }
$$

a universal coefficient bundle in $\mathbf{H}$ and $\phi : X \to \mathbf{B}G$ a twist and $\sigma : X \to \mathbf{B}\hat G$ a section, hence a cocycle in $\phi$-[[twisted cohomology]], the corresponding geometric object is the [[twisted ∞-bundle]] $\tilde \sigma$ on the total space $P$ of $\phi$

$$
  \array{
    \tilde P &\to& * 
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    P &\stackrel{\tilde \sigma}{\to}& \mathbf{B}A &\to& * 
    \\

    X 
     &\stackrel{\sigma}{\to}&
   \mathbf{B}\hat G
     &\stackrel{\mathbf{c}}{\to}&
   \mathbf{B}G
  }
  \,.
$$


### Cohesive homotopy-type theory

In general the [[geometry]] encoded by an [[(∞,1)-topos]] can be exotic. Two extra axioms ensure that it is modeled locally on $\infty$-connected geometrical archetypes, such as for instance on _[[open disks]]_ for [[Euclidean-topological ∞-groupoid|Euclidean-topological geometry]] and _smooth open disks_ for [[smooth ∞-groupoid|smooth geometry]]. Following [[Bill Lawvere|Lawvere]], we call this refinement _[[cohesive homotopy type theory]]_ [[categorical semantics|interpreted]] in _[[cohesive (∞,1)-toposes]]_.


#### Geometric realization 


A [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] is in particular equipped with a [[left adjoint|left]] [[adjoint (∞,1)-functor|derived adjoint]] $\Pi$ to the [[locally constant ∞-stack]]-functor $Disc$

$$
  (\Pi \dashv Disc)
  : 
  \mathbf{H}
   \stackrel{\overset{\Pi}{\to}}{\underset{Disc}{\hookleftarrow}}
  \infty Grpd
  \,.
$$

We may think of $\Pi$ as being the functor that sends a [[smooth ∞-groupoid]] $X$ to its [[fundamental infinity-groupoid in a locally infinity-connected (infinity,1)-topos|fundamental path ∞-groupoid]]

Under the identification (see _[[homotopy hypothesis|homotopy hypothesis theorem]]_)

$$
  \infty Grpd \stackrel{{\vert-\vert}}{\to} Top
$$

this identifies with [[geometric realization]] of geometric homotopy types / [[∞-stacks]].

We say that a lift of a [[diagram]] in [[∞Grpd]] through $\Pi$ is a **geometric refinement** of the diagram.


#### Differential cohomology

Write $\mathbf{\Pi} \coloneqq Disc \circ \Pi$; 
and $\flat \coloneqq Disc \circ \Gamma$.

For $G$ an [[∞-group]], write $\flat_{dR} \mathbf{B}G \coloneqq * \times_{\mathbf{B}G} \flat \mathbf{B}G$: the _de Rham coefficient object_ for $\mathbf{B}G$.

There is a canonical morphism $\theta : G \to \flat_{dR} \mathbf{B}G$: this identifies as the canonical _[[Maurer-Cartan form]]_ on the [[∞-group]] $G$.

For $G = \mathbf{B}^n U(1)$ the [[circle n-group|circle (n+1)-group]] we call $curv  \coloneqq_{\mathbf{B}^n U(1)} : \mathbf{B}^n U(1) \to \flat_{dR} \mathbf{B}^{n+1} U(1)$ the _universal [[curvature]] class_ in degree $(n+1)$.

The $curv$-[[twisted cohomology]] in $\mathbf{H}$ identifies with [[ordinary differential cohomology]]. 

$$
  \array{
    \mathbf{B}^n U(1)_{conn} &\to& \Omega^{n+1}_{cl}(-)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbf{B}^n U(1) &\stackrel{curv}{\to}& \mathbf{B}^{n+1} U(1)_{conn}
  }
