The idea here is to create an enormous list of well-known categories and their properties.  As the list gets large we'll have to figure out a good structure for it, but right now I'll just do a few entries in alphabetical order:

* [[Diff]] - smooth [[manifold]]s as objects, smooth maps as morphisms.  This category has finite but not infinite [[products]], and all small [[coproducts]].  It does not have equalizers or coequalizers, and is not [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]].

* [[diffeological space|Diffeological spaces]] as objects, smooth maps as morphisms.  This category has all small limits and colimits, it is [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]], and it has a weak [[subobject classifier]].  So, it is a [[quasitopos]].

* [[Grp]] - [[group]]s as objects, homomorphisms as morphisms.  Since this category consists of models of a [[Lawvere theory]] it has all small limits and colimits.

* [[Ring]] - [[ring]]s as objects, ring homomorphisms as morphisms.  Since this category consists of models of a [[Lawvere theory]] it has all small limits and colimits.

* [[Top]] - [[topological space]]s as objects, continuous functions as morphisms.   This has all small limits and colimits, but is not cartesian closed --- a problem that was addressed by introducing a 'convenient category' of topological spaces, such as $k$-spaces.

* [[Vect]] - [[vector space]]s as objects, linear maps as morphisms.  Since this category consists of models of a [[Lawvere theory]] it has all small limits and colimits.
