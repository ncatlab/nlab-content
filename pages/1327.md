## Idea


The _associahedra_ or _Stasheff polytopes_ $\{K_n\}$ are [[CW complex]]es that naturally arrange themselves into an topological [[operad]] that resolves the standard associative operad: an [[A-infinity-operad]]. 

The vertices of $K_n$ correspond to ways in which one can bracket a product of $n$ variables. The edges correspond to rebracketings, the faces relate different sequences of rebracketings that lead to the same result, and so on.

The associahedra were introduced by Jim Stasheff in order to describe [[topological space]]s equipped with a multiplication operation that is associative up to every higher coherent homotopy. 

## Definition

Here is the rough idea, copied, for the moment, verbatim from Markl94 [p. 26] (http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/hep-th/pdf/9411/9411208v1.pdf#page=26) (for more details see references below):

For $n \geq 1$ the **associahedron** $K_n$ is an $(n-2)$-dimensional polyhedron whose $i$-dimensional cells are, for $0 \leq i \leq n-2$, indexed by all (meaningful) insertions of $(n-i-2)$ pairs of brackets between $n$ independent indeterminates, with suitably defined incidence maps. 

[[simplicial set|Simplicially]] [[subdivision|subdivided]] associahedra (complete with simplicial [[operad|operadic]] structure) can be presented efficiently in terms of an abstract [[bar construction]]. Let $\mathcal{O}: Set/\mathbb{N} \to Set/\mathbb{N}$ be the [[monad]] which takes a [[graded set]] $X$ to the non-permutative [[non-unital operad]] freely generated by $X$, with monad multiplication denoted $m: \mathcal{O}\mathcal{O} \to \mathcal{O}$. Let $t_+$ be the graded set $\{X_n\}_{n \geq 0}$ that is [[empty set|empty]] for $n = 0, 1$ and [[terminal object|terminal]] for $n \geq 2$; this carries a unique non-unital non-permutative operad structure, via a structure map $\alpha: \mathcal{O}t_+ \to t_+$. The bar construction $B(\mathcal{O}, \mathcal{O}, t_+)$ is an (augmented) simplicial graded set (an object in $Set^{\Delta^{op} \times \mathbb{N}}$) whose face maps take the form 

$$\ldots \mathcal{O}\mathcal{O}\mathcal{O}t_+ 
\stackrel{\stackrel{\overset{m\mathcal{O} t_+}{\to}}{\underset{\mathcal{O}m t_+}{\to}}}{\underset{\mathcal{O}\mathcal{O}\alpha}{\to}}
\mathcal{O}\mathcal{O}t_+ \stackrel{\overset{m t_+}{\to}}{\underset{\mathcal{O}\alpha}{\to}} \mathcal{O}t_+ \stackrel{\alpha}{\to} t_+.$$ 

Intuitively, the (graded set of) $0$-cells $\mathcal{O}t_+$ consists of planar trees where each inner node has two or more incoming edges, with trees graded by number of leaves; the extreme points are binary trees [corresponding to complete binary bracketings of words], whereas other trees are barycenters of higher-dimensional faces of Stasheff polytopes. The construction $B(\mathcal{O}, \mathcal{O}, t_+)$ carries a simplicial (non-permutative non-unital) operad structure, where the [[geometric realization]] of the simplicial set at grade (or [[arity]]) $n$ defines the barycentric subdivision of the Stasheff polytope $K_n$. As the operad structure on $B(\mathcal{O}, \mathcal{O}, t_+)$ is expressed in [[doctrine|finite product logic]] and geometric realization preserves finite products, the (simplicially subdivided) associahedra form in this way the components of a topological operad. 

## Loday's realization

[[Jean-Louis Loday]] gave a simple formula for realizing the Stasheff polytopes as a convex hull of integer coordinates in Euclidean space [(Loday 2004)](#Loday04).  Let $Y_n$ denote the set of (rooted planar) binary trees with $n+1$ leaves (and hence $n$ internal vertices).  For any binary tree $t \in Y_n$, define a vector $M(t) \in \mathbb{R}^n$ whose $i$th coordinate is the product $a_i b_i$ of the number of leaves to the left of the $i$th internal vertex ($a_i$) by the number of leaves to the right of the $i$th internal vertex ($b_i$).

###### Theorem (Loday)
The convex hull of the points $\{ M(t) \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid t \in Y_n \}$ is a realization of the Stasheff polytope of dimension $n-1$.

## Illustrations

* **$K_1$** is the [[empty set]], a degenerate case not usually considered.

* **$K_2$** is simply the shape of a binary operation:
$$ x \otimes y ,$$
which we interpret here as a single [[point]].

* **$K_3$** is the shape of the usual [[associator]] or associative law
$$ (x \otimes y) \otimes z \to x \otimes (y \otimes z) ,$$
consisting of a single [[interval]].

* **$K_4$** The fourth associahedron $K_4$ is the pentagon which expresses the different ways a product of four elements may be bracketed

One can also think of this as the top-level structure of the 4th [[oriental]]. This controls in particular the _pentagon identity_ in the definition of [[monoidal category]], as discussed there.

* **$K_5$** is the [dual polyhedron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_polyhedron) to the [triaugmented triangular prism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triaugmented_triangular_prism)

## Relation to other structures

### Relation to orientals 

The above list shows that the first few Stasheff polytopes are nothing but the first few [[oriental]]s. This doesn't remain true as $n$ increases.
The orientals are free **strict** [[omega-category|omega-categories]] on [[simplex]]es as parity complexes. This means that certain interchange cells (e.g., Gray tensorators) show up as thin in the oriental description. 

The first place this happens is the sixth oriental: where there are three tensorator squares and six pentagons in Stasheff's $K_6$, the corresponding tensorator squares coming from $O(6)$ are collapsed. 

It was when [[Todd Trimble]] made this point to [[Ross Street]] that Street began to think about using associahedra to define weak [[n-category|n-categories]].
