## Idea


The _associahedra_ or _Stasheff polytopes_ $\{K_n\}$ are [[CW complex]]es that naturally arrange themselves into an topological [[operad]] that resolves the standard associative operad: an [[A-infinity-operad]]. 

The vertices of $K_n$ correspond to ways in which one can bracket a product of $n$ variables. The edges correspond to rebracketings, the faces relate different sequences of rebracketings that lead to the same result, and so on.

The associahedra were introduced by Jim Stasheff in order to describe [[topological space]]s equipped with a multiplication operation that is associative up to every higher coherent homotopy. 

## Definition

Here is the rough idea, copied, for the moment, verbatim from Markl94 [p. 26] (http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/hep-th/pdf/9411/9411208v1.pdf#page=26) (for more details see references below):

For $n \geq 1$ the **associahedron** $K_n$ is an $(n-2)$-dimensional polyhedron whose $i$-dimensional cells are, for $0 \leq i \leq n-2$, indexed by all (meaningful) insertions of $(n-i-2)$ pairs of brackets between $n$ independent indeterminants, with suitably defined incidence maps.


## Illustrations

* **$K_1$** is the [[empty set]], a degenerate case not usually considered.

* **$K_2$** is simply the shape of a binary operation:
$$ x \otimes y ,$$
which we interpret here as a single [[point]].

* **$K_3$** is the shape of the usual [[associator]] or associative law
$$ (x \otimes y) \otimes z \to x \otimes (y \otimes z) ,$$
consisting of a single [[interval]].

* **$K_4$** The fourth associahedron $K_4$ is the pentagon which expresses the different ways a product of four elements may be bracketed

One can also think of this as the top-level structure of the 4th [[oriental]]. This controls in particular the _pentagon identity_ in the definition of [[monoidal category]], as discussed there.

* **$K_5$** is the [dual polyhedron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_polyhedron) to the [triaugmented triangular prism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triaugmented_triangular_prism)

## Relation to other structures

### Relation to orientals 

The above list shows that the first few Stasheff polytopes are nothing but the first few [[oriental]]s. This doesn't remain true as $n$ increases.
The orientals are free **strict** [[omega-category|omega-categories]] on [[simplex]]es as parity complexes. This means that certain interchange cells (e.g., Gray tensorators) show up as thin in the oriental description. 

The first place this happens is the sixth oriental: where there are three tensorator squares and six pentagons in Stasheff's $K_6$, the corresponding tensorator squares coming from $O(6)$ are collapsed. 

It was when [[Todd Trimble]] made this point to [[Ross Street]] that Street began to think about using associahedra to define weak [[n-category|n-categories]].


### Categorified associahedra 
 {#Categorification}

There is a [[vertical categorification|categorification]] of associahedra discussed in
