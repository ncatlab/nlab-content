## Survey
 {#Introduction}

We are concerned with the theory of _[[spectra]]_ in the sense of [[algebraic topology]]: the proper generalization of [[abelian groups]] to [[homotopy theory]]. 

### 1) Stable homotopy theory
 {#StableHomotopyTheory}

A [[group]] in homotopy theory is equivalently a [[loop space]] under concatenation of loops ("[[∞-group]]"). A double loop space is a group with some commutativity structure ("[[Eckmann-Hilton argument]]"), a triple loop space has more commutativity structure, and so forth. A _spectrum_ is where this progression of [[looping and delooping]] _stabilizes_ (an "$\infty$-abelian group"). Therefore one speaks of _[[stable homotopy theory]]_:

$$
  Spaces
  \;\;
  \underoverset{(linearization)}{stabilization}{\mapsto}
  \;\;
  Spectra
  \,.
$$

Most of [[linear algebra]] and [[algebraic geometry]] passes along as [[abelian groups]] are generalized to [[spectra]] and turns into something remarkably rich, called _[[brave new algebra]]_, _[[higher algebra]]_ and _[[E-∞ geometry|spectral geometry]]_. In particular the analog of the theory of ([[commutative ring|commutative]]) [[rings]] and their [[modules]] exist, given by ([[commutative ring spectrum|commutative]]) [[ring spectra]] ([[E-∞ rings]], [[A-∞ rings]]) and [[module spectra]] ([[∞-modules]]). 

### 2) Adams spectral sequences
 {#ANSS}

Since spectra are considerably richer than abelian groups, stable homotopy is much concerned with "[[fracture theorem|fracturing]]" stable homotopy types into more tractable components:

To that end, notice that from the point of view of [[arithmetic geometry]], an [[abelian group]] $A$ is equivalently a [[quasicoherent sheaf]] over [[Spec(Z)]]. 

$$
  AbelianGroups \simeq QCoh(Spec(\mathbb{Z}))
  \,.
$$

This point of view generalizes to homotopy theory and turns out to be very fruitful there. The analog of the [[integers]] $\mathbb{Z}$ is the [[sphere spectrum]] $\mathbb{S}$, and this is naturally the [[initial object in an (infinity,1)-category|initial]] [[commutative ring spectrum]] ("[[E-∞ ring]]"), just as $\mathbb{Z}$ is the [[initial object|initial]] [[commutative ring]]. The [[formal dual]]  [[Spec(S)]] of $\mathbb{S}$ is hence the [[terminal object in an (infinity,1)-category|terminal]] [[space]] in [[E-∞ arithmetic geometry]] ("[[spectral geometry]]") and [[spectra]] are equivalently the [[quasicoherent ∞-stacks]] over $Spec(\mathbb{S})$

$$
  Spectra \simeq QCoh(Spec(\mathbb{S}))
  \,.
$$

Therefore the study of spectra "[[fracture theorem|fractures]]" into the various [[localizations]] and [[formal completions]] of $Spec(S)$. Since this is like the white light of $Spec(S)$ decomposing into various wavelengths, one speaks of _[[chromatic homotopy theory]]_. 

In particular, an  [[E-∞ ring]] $E$ is [[formal dual|dually]] a morphism of $E_\infty$-algebraic spaces $Spec(E) \longrightarrow Spec(\mathbb{S})$ and under good conditions the [[1-image]] of this map is the formal dual of the [[Bousfield localization of spectra|localization]] $L_E \mathbb{S}$ at $E$:

$$
  Spec(E) \stackrel{epi_1}{\longrightarrow} Spec(L_E \mathbb{S}) \stackrel{mono_1}{\longrightarrow} Spec(\mathbb{S})
 \,.
$$

This means that $Spec(E) \longrightarrow Spec(L_E \mathbb{S})$ is a [[cover]] and that hence $E$-local spectra are equivalently [[quasicoherent ∞-stacks]] on $Spec(E)$ equipped with [[descent data]]: [[formal dual|dually]] they are [[∞-modules]] over $E$ equipped with [[comodule]] structure over the [[Hopf algebroid]] ([[Sweedler coring]]) $E \otimes_{\mathbb{S}} E$.

The computation of [[homotopy groups]] of spectra that make use of their decomposition this way into $E$-[[∞-modules]] equipped with [[descent]] data is the _$E$-[[Adams spectral sequence]]_, a central tool of the theory.

### S) Complex oriented cohomology

For this reason special importance is carried by those [[E-∞ rings]] such that $Spec(E) \to Spec(\mathbb{S})$ is already a [[covering]], for these the $E$-[[∞-modules]] equipped with descent data give an equivalent, but in general more tractable, incarnation of the stable homotopy theory of spectra.

Curiously, this way a good bit of [[differential topology]] -- [[cobordism theory]] -- arises within stable homotopy theory: the archetypical $Spec(E)$ which covers $Spec(\mathbb{S})$ is $E = $ [[MU]], the [[Thom spectrum]] representing [[complex cobordism cohomology]].

An [[commutative ring spectrum]] $E$ over $MU$, hence a $Spec(E)\to Spec(MU)$ is now a [[multiplicative cohomology theory|multiplicative]] "[[complex oriented cohomology theory]]".

## **Prelude) Classical homotopy theory**
 {#ClassicalHomotopyTheory}


We are interested in the [[stable homotopy category]] of [[spectra]], to which we turn [below](#Spectra). But since its existence is an adjunct of the plain [[homotopy category]] [[Ho(Top)]] of [[homotopy types]] of [[topological spaces]]/[[simplicial sets]], we here review that first.

### Topological homotopy theory
 {#TheClassicalHomotopyCategory}


While the field of [[algebraic topology]] clearly originates in [[topology]], it is not actually interested in [[topological spaces]] regarded up to topological [[isomorphism]], namely [[homeomorphism]], but only in topological spaces regarded up to [[weak homotopy equivalence]] -- hence it is interested only in the "weak [[homotopy types]]" of topological spaces. This is so notably because [[ordinary cohomology]] [[cohomology group|groups]] are [[invariants]] of the (weak) [[homotopy type]] of topological spaces but do not detect their [[homeomorphism]] class. 

The [[category]] of topological spaces obtained by [[localizaton of a category|forcing]] [[weak homotopy equivalences]] to become [[isomorphisms]] is the "classical [[homotopy category]]" [[Ho(Top)]]. This homotopy category however has forgotten a little too much information: homotopy theory really wants the [[weak homotopy equivalences]] not to become plain [[isomorphisms]], but to become actual [[homotopy equivalences]]. The structure that reflects this is called a _[[model category]]_ structure (short for "category of models for [[homotop types]]"). For classical homotopy theory this is accordingly called the _[[classical model structure on topological spaces]]_. This we review here.

**Literature** ([Hirschhorn 15](#Hirschhorn15))

#### Background from algebraic topology

This section recalls basic relevant concepts from [[algebraic topology]] and highlights some basic facts that may serve to motivate the Quillen model structure.

##### Homotopy

The fundamental concept of [[homotopy theory]] is that of _[[homotopy]]_. In the context of [[topological spaces]] this is about [[continuous function|contiunous]] deformations of [[continuous functions]] parameterized by the standard interval:

+-- {: .num_defn #TopologicalInterval}
###### Definition

Write 

$$
  I \coloneqq [0,1] \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$

for the standard topological [[interval]], a [[compact topological space|compact]] [[connected topological space|connected]] [[topological subspace]] of the [[real line]].

Equipped with the canonical inclusion of its two endpoints

$$
  \ast \sqcup \ast \stackrel{(\delta_0,\delta_1)}{\longrightarrow} I \stackrel{\exists !}{\longrightarrow} \ast
$$

this is the standard [[interval object]] in [[Top]].

For $X \in Top$, the [[product topological space]] $X\times I$
is called the standard _[[cylinder object]]_ over $X$.
The endpoint inclusions of the interval make it factor the [[codiagonal]] on $X$

$$
  \nabla_X 
    \;\colon\; 
  X \sqcup X
  \stackrel{((id,\delta_0),(id,\delta_1))}{\longrightarrow}
  X \times I
  \longrightarrow
  X
  \,.
$$

=--



+-- {: .num_defn #LeftHomotopy}
###### Definition

For $f,g\colon X \longrightarrow Y$ two [[continuous functions]] between [[topological spaces]] $X,Y$, then a **[[left homotopy]]** $f \Rightarrow_L g$ is a [[continuous function]]

$$
  \eta \;\colon\; X \times I \longrightarrow Y
$$

out of the [[product topological space]] of $X$ with the standard interval of def. \ref{TopologicalInterval}, such that this fits into a [[commuting diagram]] of the form

$$
  \array{
     X 
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{(id,\delta_0)}}\downarrow & \searrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
     \\
     X \times I &\stackrel{\eta}{\longrightarrow}& Y
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{(id,\delta_1)}}\uparrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{g}}
     \\
     && X
  }
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #HomotopyEquivalence}
###### Definition

A [[continuous function]] $f \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Y$
is called a **[[homotopy equivalence]]** if there exists a 
continuous function $X \longleftarrow Y \;\colon\; g$
and [[left homotopies]], def. \ref{LeftHomotopy}

$$
  \eta_1 \;\colon\; f\circ g \Rightarrow_L id_Y
$$

and

$$
  \eta_2 \;\colon\; g\circ f \Rightarrow_L id_X
  \,.
$$

If here $\eta_2$ is constant along $I$, $f$ is is said to exhibit $X$ as a **[[deformation retract]]** of $Y$.

=--



Another key application of the concept of left homotopy is to the definition of [[homotopy groups]].

+-- {: .num_defn #HomotopyGroupsOftopologicalSpaces}
###### Definition

For $X$ a [[topological space]], then its set $\pi_0(X)$
of _[[connected components]]_, also called the **0-th homotopy set**, 
is the set of 
[[left homotopy]]-[[equivalence classes]] of points $\ast \to X$,
def.\ref{LeftHomotopy}. By [[composition]] this extends to a [[functor]]

$$
  \pi_0 \colon Top \longrightarrow Set
  \,.
$$

For $n \in \mathb{N}$, $n \geq 1$ and for $x \colon \ast \to X$
any point, then the $n$th **[[homotopy group]]** $\pi_n(X)$ of $X$ at $x$
is the [[group]] 

* whose underlying [[set]] is the set of [[left homotopy]]-[[equivalence classes]] of maps $I^n \longrightarrow X$ that take the [[boundary]] of $I^n$ to $x$ and where the left homotopies $\eta$ are constrained to be constant on the boundary;

* whose [[group]] product operation takes $[\alpha \colon I^n \to X]$ and $[\beta \colon I^n \to X]$ to $[\alpha \cdot \beta]$ with

$$
  \alpha \cdot \beta
  \;\colon\;
  I^n 
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  I^n \underset{I^{n-1}}{\sqcup} I^n
  \stackrel{(\alpha,\beta)}{\longrightarrow}
  X
  \,,
$$

where the first morphism is any [[homeomorphism]] from the unit $n$-[[cube]] to the $n$-cube with one side twice the unit length.

By [[composition]], this construction extends to a [[functor]] 

$$
  \pi_{\bullet \geq 1}
    \;\colon\; 
  Top^{\ast/}
   \longrightarrow 
  Grp^{\mathbb{N}_{\geq 1}}
$$

from [[pointed topological spaces]] to [[graded object|graded]] [[group]].

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #WeakHomotopyEquivalenceOfTopologicalSpaces}
###### Definition

A [[continuous function]] $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$
is called  a **[[weak homotopy equivalence]]** if its image
under all the [[homotopy group]] functors of def. \ref{HomotopyGroupsOftopologicalSpaces}
is an [[isomorphism]], hence if 

$$
  \pi_0(f) \;\colon\; \pi_0(X) \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} \pi_0(X)
$$

and for all $x \in X$ and all $n \geq 1$

$$
  \pi_n(f) \;\colon\; \pi_n(X,x) \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} \pi_n(Y,f(y))
  \,.
$$


=--

+-- {: .num_example #TopologicalHomotopyEquivalencesAreWeakHomotopyEquivalences}
###### Example

Every [[homotopy equivalence]], def. \ref{HomotopyEquivalence}, is a weak homotopy equivalence, def. \ref{WeakHomotopyEquivalenceOfTopologicalSpaces}.

In particular a [[deformation retraction]], def. \ref{HomotopyEquivalence}, is a weak homotopy equivalence.

=--


+-- {: .num_example #FactoringTopologicalCodiagonalThroughCylinder}
###### Example

For $X\in Top$, the projection $X\times I \longrightarrow X$
from the [[cylinder object]] of $X$, def. \ref{TopologicalInterval},
is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]], def. \ref{WeakHomotopyEquivalenceOfTopologicalSpaces}. 

This means that the factorization 

$$
  \nabla_X 
  \;\colon\;
  X \sqcup X
  \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}
  X\times I
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
$$

of the [[codiagonal]] $\nabla_X$ in def. \ref{TopologicalInterval}, which in general is far from being a [[monomorphism]], may be thought of as factoring it through a monomorphism after replacing $X$, up to weak homotopy equivalence, by $X\times I$.

In fact $X \sqcup X \to X \times I$ has better properties than the generic monomorphism has, in particular better homotopy invariant properties:
it has the [[left lifting property]] against all [[Serre fibrations]] $ E \stackrel{p}{\longrightarrow} B$ (def. \ref{SerreFibration}) that are also [[weak homotopy equivalences]].

=--


For $Y$ a [[topological space]], the set $Hom_{Top}(I,Y)$ of continuous functions from the standard interval $I$, def. \ref{TopologicalInterval}, to $Y$ is the set of continuous paths in $X$. Every such path may be though of as a [[left homotopy]] between its endpoints. Hence a function $X \longrightarrow Hom_{Top}(I,Y)$ is an $X$-parameterized collection of such paths. In order for that to also give a concept of homotopy, we need to impose a continuity condition on how the paths may vary, hence we need to put a suitable [[topological space|topology]] on $Hom_{Top}(I,X)$. This is the [[compact-open topology]]:

+-- {: .num_defn #CompactOpenTopology}
###### Definition

For $X$ a [[topological space]] and $Y$ a [[locally compact topological space|locally compact]] [[Hausdorff topological space]], the **[[mapping space]]**

$$
  X^Y \in Top
$$

is the [[topological space]] 

* whose underlying set is the set $Hom_{Top}(Y,X)$ of [[continuous 
functions]] $Y \to X$, 

* whose [[open subsets]] are [[finitary intersections]] of [[unions]] of the following [[topological base|subbase]] of standard open subsets:

  the standard open subset $U_{K,U} \subset Hom_{Top}(Y,X)$ for 

  * $K \hookrightarrow Y$ a [[compact topological space]] subset

  * $U \hookrightarrow X$ an [[open subset]]

  is the subset of [[continuous functions]] $f$ of all those  that fit into a [[commuting diagram]] of the form

  $$
    \array{
       K &\hookrightarrow& Y
       \\
       \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
       \\
       U &\hookrightarrow& X
    }
    \,.
  $$

Accordingly this is called the _[[compact-open topology]]_ on the set of functions.

The construction extends to a [[functor]] 

$$
  (-)^{(-)} \;\colon\; Top_{lcH}^{op} \times Top \longrightarrow Top
  \,.
$$

=--
 
+-- {: .num_prop #MappingTopologicalSpaceIsExponentialObject}
###### Proposition

For $X$ a [[topological space]] and $Y$ a [[locally compact topological space|locally compact]] [[Hausdorff topological space]], the **topological [[mapping space]]** $X^Y$ from def. \ref{CompactOpenTopology} is an [[exponential object]]: there is a [[natural isomorphism|natural]] [[bijection]]

$$
  Hom_{Top}(Z \times Y, X) \simeq Hom_{Top}(Z, X^Y)
$$ 

between continuous functions out of any [[product topological space]] of $Y$ with any $Z \in Top$ and continuous functions from $Z$ into the mapping space.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Proposition \ref{MappingTopologicalSpaceIsExponentialObject} fails if $Y$ is not locally compact and Hausdorff. Therefore the plain category [[Top]] of all topological spaces is not a [[Cartesian closed category]]. 

This is no problem for the construction of the homotopy theory of topological spaces as such, but it becomes a technical nuisance when comparing it for instance to the [[simplicial homotopy theory]] via the singular [[nerve and realization]] adjunction, since it implies that [[geometric realization]] of [[simplicial sets]] does not necessarily preserve [[finite limits]].

On the other hand, without changing any of the following discussion one may just pass to a more [[convenient category of topological spaces]] such as notably the [[full subcategory]] of [[compactly generated topological spaces]] $Top_{ck} \hookrightarrow Top$ (def. \ref{kTop}) which is [[Cartesian closed category|Cartesian closed]].

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #TopologicalPathSpace}
###### Definition

For $X$ a [[topological space]], its **[[path space object]]** is the topological [[mapping space]] $X^I$, def. \ref{MappingTopologicalSpaceIsExponentialObject}, out of the standard interval $I$ of def. \ref{TopologicalInterval}.


=--

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

The endpoint inclusion into the standard interval, def. \ref{TopologicalInterval}, makes the path space $X^I$ of def. \ref{TopologicalPathSpace} factor the [[diagonal]] on $X$ through the inclusion of constant paths and the endpoint evaluation of paths:


$$
  \Delta_X
  \;\colon\; 
  X \stackrel{X^{I \to \ast}}{\longrightarrow} X^I \stackrel{X^{\ast \sqcup \ast \to I}}{\longrightarrow} X \times X
  \,.
$$

Here

1. $X^{I \to \ast}$ is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]];

1. $X^{\ast \sqcup \ast \to I}$ is a [[Serre fibration]].

So while in general the [[diagonal]] $\Delta_X$ is far from being an [[epimorphism]] or even just a [[Serre fibration]], the factorization through the [[path space object]] may be thought of as replacing $X$, up to weak homotopy equivalence, by its path space, such as to turn its diagonal into a Serre fibration after all.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

For $f,g\colon X \longrightarrow Y$ two [[continuous functions]] between [[topological spaces]] $X,Y$, then a **[[right homotopy]]** $f \Rightarrow_R g$ is a [[continuous function]]

$$
  \eta \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Y^I
$$

into the [[path space object]] of $X$, def. \ref{TopologicalPathSpace}, such that this fits into a [[commuting diagram]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    && Y
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{f}}\nearrow & \uparrow^{\mathrlap{X^{\delta_0}}}
    \\
    X &\stackrel{\eta}{\longrightarrow}& Y^I
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{g}}\searrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{Y^{\delta_1}}}
    \\
    Y
  }
  \,.
$$

##### Cell complexes

+-- {: .num_defn #TopologicalGeneratingCofibrations}
###### Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ write

* $D^n \coloneqq \{ \vec x\in \mathbb{R}^n | {\vert \vec x \vert \leq 1}\} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ for the standard topological [[n-disk]];

* $S^{n-1} = \partial D^n \coloneqq \{ \vec x\in \mathbb{R}^n | {\vert \vec x \vert = 1}\} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ for the standard topological [[n-sphere]];

Write

$$
  I_{Top}
    \coloneqq
  \{S^{n-1} \stackrel{\iota_n}{\hookrightarrow} D^{n}\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}
    \subset 
  Mor(Top)
$$

for the set of canonical [[boundary]] inclusion maps. This going to be called the set of standard **topological [[generating cofibrations]]**.

Notice that $S^{-1} = \emptyset$ and that $S^0 = \ast \sqcup \ast$.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #TopologicalCellComplex}
###### Definition

For $X \in Top$ and for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, an **$n$-cell attachment** to $X$ is the [[pushout]] of a generatic cofibration, def. \ref{TopologicalGeneratingCofibrations}

$$
  \array{
    S^{n-1} &\stackrel{\phi}{\longrightarrow}& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\iota_n}}\downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    D^n &\longrightarrow& X {}_\phi\underset{S^{n-1}}{\sqcup} D^n
  }
$$

along some [[continuous function]] $\phi$.

A continuous function $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ is called a **topological [[relative cell complex]]** if it is exhibited by a (possibly infinite) sequence of cell attachments to $X$, hence if it is a [[transfinite composition]] of [[pushouts]]

$$
  \array{
    \underset{i}{\coprod} S^{n_i - 1} &\longrightarrow& X_{k-1}
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\underset{i}{\coprod}\iota_{n_i}}}\downarrow 
     &(po)& \downarrow  
    \\
    \underset{i}{\coprod} D^{n_i} &\longrightarrow& X_{k}
  }
$$

of [[coproducts]] of [[generating cofibrations]].

A topological space is a **[[cell complex]]** if $\emptyset \longrightarrow X$ is a relative cell complex.

A relative cell complex is called a **finite relative cell complex** if it is obtained from a [[finite number]] of cell attachments.

A (relative) cell complex is called a (relative) **[[CW-complex]]** if in the above transfinite composition is countable 

$$
  \array{
    X = X_0 &\longrightarrow& X_1 &\longrightarrow& X_2 &\longrightarrow& \cdots
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{f}}\searrow & \downarrow & \swarrow && \cdots
    \\
    && Y = \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim} X_\bullet
  }
$$

and if $X_k$ is obtained from $X_{k-1}$ by attaching cells precisely only of [[dimension]] $k$.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Strictly speaking a relative cell complex, def. \ref{TopologicalCellComplex}, is a function $f\colon X \to Y$, _together_ with its cell structure, hence together with the information of the pushout diagrams and the transfinite composition of the pushout maps that exhibit it.

In many applications, however,  all that matters is that there is _some_ (relative) cell decomosition, and then one tends to speak loosely and mean by a (relative) cell complex only a (relative) topological space that admits some cell decomposition.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #TopologicalCCellComplex}
###### Definition

For $C \subset Mor(\mathcal{C})$ any [[class]] of morphisms, the concept of  **relative $C$-cell complexes** is defined as in def. \ref{TopologicalCellComplex}, with the boundary inclusions $\iota_n \in I_{Top}$ replaced by the maps in $C$: 

a **relative $C$-cell complex** is a [[transfinite composition]] of [[pushouts]] of [[coproducts]] of the maps in $C \hookrightarrow Mor(Top)$.

=--

Given a relative $C$-cell complex $\iota \colon  X \to Y$, def. \ref{TopologicalCCellComplex}, it is typically interesting to study the [[extension]] problem along $f$, i.e. to ask which topological spaces $E$ are such that every [[continuous function]] $f\colon X \longrightarrow E$ has an extension $\tilde $ along $\iota$ 

$$
  \array{
    X &\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}& E
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\iota}}\downarrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\exists \tilde f}}
    \\
    Y
  }
  \,.
$$

If so, then this means that $E$ is sufficiently "spead out" with respect to the maps in $C$. More generally one considers this extension problem fiberwise, i.e. with both $E$ and $Y$ (hence also $X$) equipped with a map to some base space $B$.


+-- {: .num_defn #RightLiftingProperty}
###### Definition

Given a [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$ and a sub-[[class]] $C \subset Mor(\mathcal{C})$ of its [[morphisms]], then a morphism $p \colon E \longrightarrow B$ in $\mathcal{C}$ is said to have the [[right lifting property]] against the morphisms in $C$ if every [[commuting diagram]] in $\mathcal{C}$ of the form

$$
  \array{
    X &\longrightarrow& E

These inclusions are similar to the standard topological [[generating cofibrations]] of def. \ref{TopologicalGeneratingCofibrations}, but in contrast to these they are "acyclic" (meaning: trivial on homotopy classes of maps from "cycles" given by [[n-spheres]]) in that they are [[weak homotopy equivalences]] (example \ref{FactoringTopologicalCodiagonalThroughCylinder}).

#### Background on model category theory

This section recalls some standard arguments in [[model category]] theory.

+-- {: .num_remark #RetractsOfMorphisms}
###### Remark

As usual, by a [[retract]] of a [[morphism]] $X \stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow} Y$ in some [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$ we mean a retract in the [[arrow category]] $\mathcal{C}^{\Delta[1]}$, hence a morphism $A \stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow} B$ such that in $\mathcal{C}^{\Delta[1]}$ there is a factorization of the identity on $g$ through $f$

$$
  id_g \;\colon\;
  g \longrightarrow f \longrightarrow g
  \,.
$$

This means equivalently that in $\mathcal{C}$ there is a [[commuting diagram]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    id_A \colon & A &\longrightarrow& X &\longrightarrow& A
    \\
    & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{g}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{g}}

##### Lifting and extension


+-- {: .num_defn #LiftingAndExtension}
###### Definition

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be any [[category]]. 
Given a [[diagram]] in $\mathcal{C}$ of the form

$$
  \array{
     X &\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}& Y
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{p}}\downarrow
     \\
     B
  }
$$

then an *[[extension]]* of the [[morphism]] $f$ along the [[morphism]] $p$ is a completion to a [[commuting diagram]] of the form

$$
  \array{
     X &\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}& Y
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{p}}\downarrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\tilde f}}
     \\

  }
  \,.
$$

Dually, given a [[diagram]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    && A
    \\
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    X &\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}& Y
  }
$$

then a **[[lift]]** of $f$ through $p$ is a completion to a [[commuting diagram]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    && A
    \\
    &{}^{\mathllap{\tilde f}}\nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    X &\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}& Y
  }
  \,.
$$

Combining these cases: given a square [[commuting diagram]] 

$$
  \array{
     X_1 &\stackrel{f_1}{\longrightarrow}& Y_1
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{p_l}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p_r}}
     \\
     X_2 &\stackrel{f_1}{\longrightarrow}& Y_2     
  }
$$

then a **[[lifting]]** in the diagram is a completion to a [[commuting diagram]] of the form

$$
  \array{
     X_1 &\stackrel{f_1}{\longrightarrow}& Y_1
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{p_l}}\downarrow &\nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p_r}}
     \\
     X_2 &\stackrel{f_1}{\longrightarrow}& Y_2     
  }
  \,.
$$

Given a sub-[[class]] of morphhisms $C \subset Mor(\mathcal{C})$, then a morphism $p_r$ as above is said to have the **[[right lifting property]]** against $C$ if in all square diagrams with $p_r$ on the right and any $p_l \in C$ on the left a lift exists. Dually, a fixed $p_l$ is said to have the **[[left lifting property]]** against $C$ if in all square diagrams with $p_l$ on the left and any $p_r \in C$ on the left a lift exists.

###### Lemma

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[category]] with all small [[colimits]],
and let $C\subset Mor(\mathcal{C})$ be a sub-[[class]] of its morphisms.

Then every $C$-fibration, def. \ref{RightLiftingProperty}, has the [[right lifting property]], def. \ref{LiftingAndExtension}, against all $C$-[[relative cell complexes]], def. \ref{TopologicalCCellComplex} and their [[retracts]], remark \ref{RetractsOfMorphisms}.

###### Lemma
**(retract argument)**

If in a composite morphism

$$
  g \;\colon\; \stackrel{i}{\longrightarrow} \stackrel{p}{\longrightarrow}
$$

the factor $p$ has the [[right lifting property]], def. \ref{RightLiftingProperty}, against the total morphism $g$, then $g$ is a [[retract]] (rem. \ref{RetractsOfMorphisms}) of $i$.

=--


##### The small object argument

Given a class $C \subset Mor(\mathcal{C})$ of morphisms in some [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$, a natural question is how to factor any given morphism $f\colon X \longrightarrow Y$ through a relative $C$-cell complex, def. \ref{TopologicalCCellComplex}, followed by a $C$-fibration, def. \ref{RightLiftingProperty}

$$
  f 
    \;\colon\; 
  X 
    \stackrel{\in C cell}{\longrightarrow} 
  \hat X
    \stackrel{\in C fib}{\longrightarrow} 
  Y
  \,.
$$

A first approximation to such a factorization turns out to be given simply by forming $\hat X = X_1$ by attaching **all** possible $C$-cells to $X$. Namely let

$$
  (C/f) 
   \coloneqq
  \left\{
    \array{
       dom(c) &\stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}& X
       \\
       {}^{\mathllap{c\in C}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
       \\
       cod(c) &\longrightarrow& Y
    }
  \right\}
$$

be the set of **all** ways to find a $C$-cell attachment in $f$, and consider the [[pushout]] $\hat X$ of the [[coproduct]] of morphisms in $C$ over all these:

$$
  \array{
    \underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} dom(c) &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} c}}\downarrow
    &(po)& 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{}}
    \\
    \underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} cod(c)
    &\longrightarrow&
    X_1
  }
  \,.
$$

This gets already close to producing the intended factorization: 

First of all the resulting map $X \to X_1$ is a $C$-relative cell complex, by construction. 

Second, by the fact that the coproduct is over all commuting squres to $f$, the morphism $f$ itself makes a [[commuting diagram]] 

$$
  \array{
    \underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} dom(c) &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} c}}\downarrow
    && 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    \underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} cod(c)
    &\longrightarrow&
    Y
  }
$$

and hence the [[universal property]] of the [[colimit]] means that $f$ is indeed factored through that $C$-cell complex $X_1$; we may suggestively arrange that factorizing diagram like so:

$$
  \array{
    \underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} dom(c) 
      &\longrightarrow& 
    X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{id}}\downarrow
    && 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{}}
    \\
    \underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} dom(c)
     &&
    X_1
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} c}}\downarrow 
    &\nearrow& \downarrow
    \\
    \underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} cod(c)
    &\longrightarrow&
    Y
  }
  \,.
$$

This shows that, finally, the colimiting [[co-cone]] map -- the one that now appears diagonally -- **almost** exhibits the desired right lifting of $X_1 \to X$ against the $c\in C$. The failure of that to hold on the nose is only the fact that a horizontal map in the middle of the above diagram is missing: the diagonal map obtained above lifts not all commuting diagrams of $c\in C$ into $f$, but only those where the top morphism $dom(c) \to X_1$ factors through $X \to X_1$.

The idea of the [[small object argument]] now is to fix this only problem by iterating the construction: next factor $X_1 \to X$ in the same way into 

$$
  X_1 \longrightarrow X_2 \longrightarrow X
$$

and so forth. Since relative $C$-cell complexes are closed under composition, at stage $n$ the resulting $X \longrightarrow X_n$ is still a $C$-cell complex, getting bigger and bigger. But accordingly, the failure of the accompanying $X_n \longrightarrow Y$ to be a $C$-fibration becomes smaller and smaller, for it now lifts against all diagrams where $dom(c) \longrightarrow X_n$ factors through $X_{n-1}\longrightarrow X_n$, which intuitively is less and less of a condition as the $X_{n-1}$ grow larger and larger.

The concept of _[[small object]]_ is just what makes this intuition precise and finishes the small object argument. For the present purpose we just need the following simple version:

###### Definition

The continuous functions with the [[right lifting property]], def. \ref{RightLiftingProperty} against the set $I_{Top} = \{S^{n-1}\hookrightarrow D^n\}$ of topological [[generating cofibrations]], def. \ref{TopologicalGeneratingCofibrations}, are precisely those which are both [[weak homotopy equivalences]], def. \ref{WeakHomotopyEquivalenceOfTopologicalSpaces} as well as [[Serre fibrations]], def. \ref{SerreFibration}.

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We break this up into three sub-statements:

**A) $I_{Top}$-fibrations are in particular weak homotopy equivalences**

Let $p \colon \hat X \to X$ have the [[right lifting property]] against $I_{Top}$

$$
  \array{
    S^{n-1}  &\longrightarrow & \hat X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\iota_n}}\downarrow &{}^{\mathllap{\exists}}\nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    D^n &\longrightarrow& X
  }
$$

We check that the lifts in these diagrams exhibit $\pi_\bullet(f)$ as being an [[isomorphism]] on all [[homotopy groups]], def. \ref{HomotopyGroupsOftopologicalSpaces}:


For $n = 0$ the existence of these lifts says that every point of $X$ is in the image of $p$, hence that $\pi_0(\hat X) \to \pi_0(X)$ is [[surjection|surjective]]. Let then $S^0 = \ast \coprod \ast \longrightarrow \hat X$ be a map that hits two connected components, then the existence of the lift says that if they have the same image in $\pi_0(X)$ then they were already the same connected component in $\hat X$. Hence $\pi_0(\hat X)\to \pi_0(X)$ is also [[injection|injective]] and hence is a [[bijection]].

Similarly, for $n \geq 1$, if $S^n \to \hat X$ represents an element in $\pi_n(\hat X)$ that becomes trivial in $\pi_n(X)$, then the existence of the lift says that it already represented the trivial element itself. Hence $\pi_n(\hat X) \to \pi_n(X)$ has trivial [[kernel]] and so is injective. 

Finally, to see that $\pi_n(\hat X) \to \pi_n(X)$ is also surjective, hence bijective, observe that every elements in $\pi_n(X)$ is equivalently represented by a commuting diagram of the form

$$
  \array{
    S^{n-1} &\longrightarrow& \ast &\longrightarrow& \hat X
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    D^n &\longrightarrow& X &=& X
  }  
$$

and so here the lift gives a representative of a preimage in $\pi_{n}(\hat X)$.

**B) $I_{Top}$-fibrations are in particular Serre fibrations**

By lemma \ref{SaturationOfGeneratingCofibrations} an $I_{Top}$-fibration has also the [[right lifting property]] against all [[relative cell complexes]], and hence by lemma \ref{TopologicalGeneratingAcyclicCofibrationsAreRelativeCellComplexes} it is also a $J_{Top}$-fibration, hence a Serre fibration.

**C) Acyclic Serre fibrations are in particular $I_{Top}$-fibrations**

A proof of this is spelled out in ([Hirschhorn 15, section 6](#Hirschhorn15)).

By lemma \ref{CompactSubsetsAreSmallInCellComplexes}

Hence by the [[small object argument]], prop. \ref{SmallObjectArgument}, $f$ factors as an $I_{Top}$-relative cell complex, hence just a plain relative cell complex, followed by an $I_{Top}$-fibration, def. \ref{RightLiftingProperty}.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By lemma \ref{TopologicalGeneratingAcyclicCofibrationsAreRelativeCellComplexes} a relative $J_{Top}$-cell complex is in particular a relative $I_{Top}$-cell complex. 

By lemma \ref{CompactSubsetsAreSmallInCellComplexes}
the set $J_{Top} = \{D^n \hookrightarrow D^n\times I\}$ of 
topological [[generating acyclic cofibrations]], def. \ref{TopologicalGeneratingAcyclicCofibrations}, has small domains, in the sense of def. \ref{ClassOfMorphismsWithSmallDomains} (the [[n-disks]] are [[compact topological space|compact]]). Hence by the [[small object argument]], prop. \ref{SmallObjectArgument}, $f$ factors as an $J_{Top}$-relative cell complex, followed by an $J_{top}$-fibration, def. \ref{RightLiftingProperty}:

$$
  f
  \;\colon\;
  X 
   \stackrel{J_{Top} cell}{\longrightarrow}
  \hat X
    \stackrel{J_{Top} fib}{\longrightarrow}
  X
  \,.
$$

By definition this makes $\hat X \to X$ a [[Serre fibration]], hence a fibration.

By lemma \ref{TopologicalGeneratingAcyclicCofibrationsAreRelativeCellComplexes} a relative $J_{Top}$-cell complex is in particular a relative $I_{Top}$-cell complex and hence $X \to \hat X$ is a cofibration.

Finally, to see that relative $J_{Top}$-cell complexes are weak homotopy equivalences, first notice that with the elements $D^n \hookrightarrow D^n \times I$ of $J_{Top}$ themselves, also each stage $X_{k} \to X_{k+1}$ in the construction of $\hat X$ via the [[small object argument]] is a [[strong deformation retract]], hence, by example \ref{TopologicalHomotopyEquivalencesAreWeakHomotopyEquivalences}, a weak homotopy equivalence. Now the [[small object argument]] with lemma \ref{CompactSubsetsAreSmallInCellComplexes} applies once more to give that every representative and every null homotopy of elements in $\pi_n(\hat X)$ already exist at some stage $X_n$, hence that also $\underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_{k} \pi_\bullet(X_k)\to \pi_\bullet(\hat X)$ is an isomorphism.

###### Proof

**A)** If the fibration $f$ is also a weak equivalence, then lemma \ref{AcyclicSerreFibrationsAreTheJTopFibrations} says that it has the right lifting property against the generating cofibrations $I_{Top}$, and lemma \ref{SaturationOfGeneratingCofibrations} implies the claim.

**B)** If the cofibration $g$ on the left is also a weak equivalence, consider any factorization into a relative $J_{Top}$-cell complex, def. \ref{TopologicalGeneratingAcyclicCofibrations}, def. \ref{TopologicalCCellComplex}, followed by a fibration,

$$
  g \;\colon\; \stackrel{J_{Top} cell}{\longrightarrow} \stackrel{fib}{\longrightarrow}
  \,,
$$

as in the proof of prop. \ref{ContinuousFunctionsFactorAsQuillenAcyclicCofibrationFollowedBySerreFibration}. Now by [[two-out-of-three]], prop. \ref{QuillenWeakEquivalencesSatisfyTwoOutOfThree}, the factorizing fibration is actually an acyclic fibration. By ase A), this acyclic fibration has the [[right lifting property]] against the cofibration $g$ itself, and so lemma \ref{RetractArgument} gives that $g$  is a [[retract]] of a relative $J_{Top}$-cell complex. With this, finally lemma \ref{SaturationOfGeneratingCofibrations} implies that $f$ has the [[right lifting property]] against $g$.

### $(\star)$ Simplicial homotopy theory 
 {#SimplicialSets}


The nature of [[objects]] in any [[category]] is not determined by how we present these objects, but by the web of [[morphisms]] relating them ([[structuralism]]). In this respect, the objects of the classical homotopy category [[Ho(Top)]] [above](#TheClassicalHomotopyCategory) turn out to have lost the geometric nature of [[topology]] to retain only a more set-theoretic combinatorial nature. This is more explicitly captured by the concept of _[[simplicial sets]]_ and their _[[simplicial homotopy theory]]_.

#### Simplicial sets

Simplicial sets are secretly well familiar already in basic [[algebraic topology]]: they reflect just the abstract structure carried by the [[singular simplicial complexes]] of topological spaces, as in the definition of [[singular homology]] and [[singular cohomology]]. 

Conversely, every simplicial set may be [[geometric realization|geometrically realized]] as a topological space. These two [[adjoint]] operations turn out to exhibit the homotopy theory of simplicial sets as being equivalent ([[Quillen equivalence|Quillen equivalent]]) to the homotopy theory of topological spaces.  For some purposes, working in [[simplicial homotopy theory]] is preferable over working with topological homotopy theory.

The sets $(Sing X)_\bullet$ here are closely related by an interlocking system of maps that make them form what is called a _[[simplicial set]]_, and as such the collection of these sets of singular simplices is called the _[[singular simplicial complex]]_ of $X$. We discuss the definition of simplicial sets now and then come back to this below in def. \ref{SingularSimplicialComplex}.

Since the topological $n$-simplices $\Delta^n$ from def. \ref{TopologicalSimplex} sit inside each other by the face inclusions of def. \ref{FaceInclusionInBarycentricCoords}

$$
  \delta_k : \Delta^{n-1} \to \Delta^{n}

and project onto each other by the degeneracy maps, def. \ref{DegeneracyProjectionsInBarycentricCoords}

$$
  \sigma_k : \Delta^{n+1} \to \Delta^n
$$

we dually have functions

$$
  d_k \coloneqq Hom_{Top}(\delta_k, X) : (Sing X)_n \to (Sing X)_{n-1}
$$

that send each singular $n$-simplex to its $k$-face and functions

$$

1. $s_i \circ s_j  = s_j \circ s_{i-1}$ if $i \gt j$.

It is straightforward to check by explicit inspection that the evident injection and restriction maps between the sets of [[singular simplices]] make $(Sing X)_\bullet$ into a simplicial set. However for working with this, it is good to streamline a little:

    \\
    [1] & \coloneqq \{0 \to 1\}

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

This is called the "simplex category" because we are to think of the object $[n]$ as being the "[[spine]]" of the $n$-[[nLab:simplex]]. For instance for $n = 2$ we think of $0 \to 1 \to 2$ as the "spine" of the triangle. This becomes clear if we don't just draw the morphisms that _generate_ the category $[n]$, but draw also all their composites. For instance for $n = 2$ we have_

$$
  [2]  
  = 
  \left\{
  \array{
     && 1
     \\

A [[functor]]

###### Proof

One checks by inspection that the simplicial identities 
characterize precisely the behaviour of the morphisms in
$\Delta^{op}([n],[n+1])$ and $\Delta^{op}([n],[n-1])$.

is given by composition of the functor from example \ref{StandardCosimplicialTopologicalSpace} with the [[nLab:hom functor]] of [[nLab:Top]]:

###### Remark 

It turns out -- this is the content of the _[[nLab:homotopy hypothesis]]-theorem_ ([Quillen 67](model+structure+on+simplicial+sets#Quillen67)) -- that [[homotopy type]] of the topological space $X$ is entirely captured by its singular simplicial complex $Sing X$. Moreover, the [[geometric realization]] of $Sing X$ is a model for the same [[homotopy type]] as that of $X$, but with the special property that it is canonically a [[cell complex]] -- a [[CW-complex]]. Better yet, $Sing X$ is itself already good cell complex, namely a [[Kan complex]]. We come to this below.

#### Homotopy

The the basic invariants of [[simplicial sets]]/[[Kan complexes]] in [[simplicial homotopy theory]] are their [[simplicial homotopy groups]], to which we turn now.
 
Given that a [[Kan complex]] is a special [[simplicial set]] that [[homotopy hypothesis|behaves like]] a combinatorial model for a [[topological space]], the _simplicial homotopy groups_ of a  Kan complex are accordingly the combinatorial analog of the [[homotopy groups]] of [[topological spaces]]: instead of being maps from topological [[spheres]] modulo maps from topological disks, they are maps from the [[boundary of a simplex]] modulo those from the [[simplex]] itself. 

Accordingly, the definition of the discussion of simplicial homotopy groups is essentially literally the same as that of [[homotopy groups]] of topological spaces.  One technical difference is for instance that the definition of the group structure is slightly more non-immediate for simplicial homotopy groups than for topological homotopy groups (see below).


+-- {: .num_defn #UnderlyingSetsOfSimplicialHomotopyGroups}

For $X$ a [[Kan complex]], then its **0th [[simplicial homotopy group]]** (or **set of [[connected components]]**) is the set of [[equivalence classes]] of vertices modulo the [[equivalence relation]] $X_1 \stackrel{(d_1,d_0)}{\longrightarrow} X_0 \times X_0$

$$
  \pi_0(X) \colon X_0/X_1

For $x \in X_0$ a vertex and for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $n \geq 1$, then the underlying [[set]]  of the **$n$th [[simplicial homotopy group]]** of $X$ at $x$ -- denoted $\pi_n(X,x)$ -- is, the set of [[equivalence classes]] $[\alpha]$ of morphisms

$$
  \alpha \colon \Delta^n \to X
$$ 
 
from the simplicial $n$-[[simplex]] $\Delta^n$ to $X$, such that these take the [[boundary of a simplex|boundary of the simplex]] to $x$, i.e. such that they fit into a [[commuting diagram]] in [[sSet]] of the form
 
$$
  \array{
     \partial \Delta[n] & \longrightarrow &  \Delta[0]
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{x}}
     \\

where two such maps $\alpha, \alpha'$ are taken to be equivalent is they are related by a [[simplicial homotopy]] $\eta$

     \downarrow^{i_0} & \searrow^{\alpha}

     \\
     \uparrow^{i_1} & \nearrow_{\alpha'}

$$

that fixes the boundary in that it fits into a [[commuting diagram]] in [[sSet]] of the form

$$
  \array{

These sets are taken to be equipped with the following group structure.

+-- {: .num_defn #ProductOnSimplicialHomotopyGroups}
###### Definition 
  
For $X$ a [[Kan complex]], for $x\in X_0$, for $n \geq 1$ and for  $f,g \colon \Delta[n] \to X$ two representatives of $\pi_n(X,x)$ as in def. \ref{UnderlyingSetsOfSimplicialHomotopyGroups}, consider the following $n$-simplices in $X_n$:

$$
  v_i 
  \coloneqq
  \left\{
    \array{
      s_0 \circ s_0 \circ \cdots \circ s_0 (x) & for \; 0 \leq i \leq  n-2
      \\
      f & for \; i = n-1
      \\
      g & for \; i = n+1
    }
  \right.
$$

This corresponds to a morphism $\Lambda^{n+1}[n] \to X$ from a [[horn]] of the $(n+1)$-[[simplex]] into $X$. By the [[Kan complex]] property of $X$ this morphism has an [[extension]] $\theta$ through the $(n+1)$-[[simplex]] $\Delta[n]$

$$
  \array{
     \Lambda^{n+1}[n] & \longrightarrow & X
     \\
     \downarrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\theta}}
     \\
     \Delta[n+1]
  }
$$

From the [[simplicial identities]] one finds that the boundary of the $n$-simplex arising as the $n$th boundary piece $d_n \theta$ of $\theta$ is constant on $x$

$$
  d_i d_{n} \theta = d_{n-1} d_i \theta = x
$$

So $d_n \theta$ represents an element in $\pi_n(X,x)$ and we define a product operation on $\pi_n(X,x)$ by

$$
  [f]\cdot [g] \coloneqq [d_n \theta]

For $X$ a [[topological space]], its [[singular simplicial complex]]
$Sing(X)$, def. \ref{SingularSimplicialComplex}, is a Kan complex, def. \ref{KanComplexes}.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The inclusions ${{\Lambda^n}_{Top}}_k \hookrightarrow \Delta^n_{Top}$ of topological horns into topological simplices are  [[retracts]], in that there are [[continuous maps]] $\Delta^n_{Top} \to {{\Lambda^n}_{Top}}_k$ given by "squashing" a topological $n$-simplex onto parts of its boundary, such that

$$
  ({{\Lambda^n}_{Top}}_k \to \Delta^n_{Top} \to
  {{\Lambda^n}_{Top}}_k)
  =
  Id
  \,.
$$

Therefore the map
$[\Delta^n, \Pi(X)] \to [\Lambda^n_k,\Pi(X)]$ is an epimorphism, since it is equal to  to $Top(\Delta^n, X) \to Top(\Lambda^n_k, X)$ which has a right inverse $Top(\Lambda^n_k, X) \to Top(\Delta^n, X)$.

By assumption of the base being connected, the classifying maps for the fibers over any two vertices are connected by a [[zig-zag]] of [[homotopies]], hence by lemma \ref{PullbackOfKanFibrationSendsLeftHomotopyToFiberwiseHomotopyequivalence} the fibers are connected by [[homotopy equivalences]] and then by prop. \ref{PullbackPreservesMinimalFibration} and lemma \ref{FiberwiseHomotopyEquivalenceOfMinimalFibrationsIsIso} they are already isomorphic. Write $F$ for this [[typical fiber]].

Moreover, for all $n$ the morphisms $\Delta[n] \to \Delta[0] \to \Delta[n]$ are [[left homotopy|left homotopic]] to $\Delta[n] \stackrel{id}{\to} \Delta[n]$ and so applying lemma \ref{PullbackOfKanFibrationSendsLeftHomotopyToFiberwiseHomotopyequivalence} and prop. \ref{FiberwiseHomotopyEquivalenceOfMinimalFibrationsIsIso} once more yields that the fiber over each $\Delta[n]$ is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to $\Delta[n]\times F$.

Thus for a topological space $X$ the [[adjunction counit]] $\epsilon_X \colon {\vert Sing X\vert} \longrightarrow X$ of the [[nerve and realization]]-adjunction is a candidate for a replacement of $X$ by a CW-complex. For this, $\epsilon_X$ should be at least a [[weak homotopy equivalence]], i.e. induce [[isomorphisms]] on all [[homotopy groups]]. Since homotopy groups are built from maps into $X$ out of [[compact topological spaces]] it is plausible that this works if the topology of $X$ is entirely detected by maps out of compact topological spaces into $X$. Topological spaces with this property are called [[compactly generated topological spaces|compactly generated]].

### Homotopy fiber sequences

A key aspect of [[homotopy theory]] is that the [[universal constructions]] of [[category theory]], such as [[limits]] and [[colimits]], receive a refinement whereby their [[universal properties]] hold not just up to [[isomorphism]] but up to ([[weak homotopy equivalence|weak]]) [[homotopy equivalence]]. One speaks of _[[homotopy limits]]_ and _[[homotopy colimits]]_.

We consider this here just for the special case of [[homotopy fibers]] and [[homotopy cofibers]], leading to the phenomenon of [[homotopy fiber sequences]] and their induced [[long exact sequences of homotopy groups]] which control much of the theory to follow.

The _[[mapping cone]]_ of a [[morphism]] $f : X \to Y$ in some [[homotopical category]] (precisely: a [[category of cofibrant objects]]) is, if it exists, a particular representative of the [[homotopy cofiber]] of $f$. 

It is also called the _homotopy [[cokernel]]_ of $f$ or the _[[weak quotient]]_ of $Y$ by the [[image]] of $X$ in $Y$ under $f$. 



The mapping cone construction is a means to _present_ in a [[category with weak equivalences]] the following canonical
construction in [[homotopy theory]]/[[(∞,1)-category theory]].

Intuitively this says that $cone(f)$ is the object obtained by

1. forming the cylinder over $X$;

1. gluing to one end of that the object $Y$ as specified by the map $f$.

1. shrinking the other end of the cylinder to the point.

Intuitively it is clear that this way every [[cycle]] in $Y$ that happens to be in the image of $X$ can be "continuously" translated in the cylinder-direction, keeping it constant in $Y$, to the other end of the cylinder, where it becomes the point. This means that every [[homotopy group]] of $Y$ in the image of $f$ vanishes in the mapping cone. Hence in the mapping conee **the image of $X$ under $f$ in $Y$ is removed up to homotopy**. This makes it clear how $cone(f)$ is a homotopy-version of the [[cokernel]] of $f$. And therefore the name "mapping cone".

A morphism $\eta : cyl(X) \to Y$ out of a [[cylinder object]] is a [[left homotopy]] $\eta : g \Rightarrow h$ (def. \ref{LeftHomotopyOfSimplicialSets}) between its restrictions $g\coloneqq \eta(0)$ and $h \coloneqq \eta(1)$ to the cylinder boundaries

Therefore prop. \ref{HomotopyCofiberByFactorizationLemma} says that 
the mapping cone is the the [[universal property|universal]] object with a morphism $i$ from $Y$ and a [[left homotopy]] from $i \circ f$ to the [[zero morphism]]. This is of course also precisely what def. \ref{InfinityCokernel} is saying.

+-- {: .num_prop #HomotopyPullbackByOrdinaryPullback}
###### Proposition

Let $A \to C \leftarrow B$ be a [[diagram]] in some [[model category]]. Then sufficient conditions for the ordinary (1-categorical) [[pullback]] $A \times_C B$ to present the homotopy pullback of the diagram are

* one of the two morphisms is a [[fibration]] and all three objects are [[fibrant objects]];

* one of the two morphisms is a [[fibration]] and the model category is [[right proper model category|right proper]].

=--

The proof of the second statement is spelled out [here](proper+model+category#HomotopyLimits).

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

Notice that a fibrant [[resolution]] of the diagram in the injective [[model structure on functors]] has _both_ morphisms be a fibration. So the first point in prop. \ref{HomotopyPullbackByOrdinaryPullback} says that (in the special case of pullbacks) something weaker than this is sufficient for computing the [[homotopy limit]] of the diagram.

This can be explained in model-categorical terms by the fact that the category of [[cospans]] also has a [[Reedy model structure]] in which the fibrant objects are precisely those considered in the first point above, and that homotopy limits can equally well be computed using this model structure (specifically, the [[adjunction]] $Const \dashv Lim$ is [[Quillen adjunction|Quillen]] with respect to it).

In this spirit one may ask for the largest class of morphisms such that their ordinary pullbacks are already homotopy pullbacks. This is related to the concept of _[[sharp morphisms]]_.

=--



Due to prop. \ref{HomotopyPullbackByOrdinaryPullback} one typically computes homotopy pullbacks of a diagram by first forming a [[resolution]] of one of the two morphisms by a fibration and then forming an ordinary pullback. 

+-- {: .num_cor #HomotopyPullbackByFactorizationLemma}
###### Corollary

If in $A \stackrel{f}{\to} C \stackrel{g}{\leftarrow} B$ 
all three objects are [[fibrant objects]], then
the homotopy pullback of this diagram is presented by the ordinary [[pullback]]

$$
  \array{
     A\times_C^h B & \to & C^I \times_C B
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow 
    \\
     A & \stackrel{f}{\to} & C
  }
  \,.
$$

or, equivalently up to [[isomorphism]], as the ordinary [[pullback]]

$$
  \array{
     A\times_C^h B & \to & C^I
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow 
    \\
     A\times B & \stackrel{(f,g)}{\to} & C\times C
  }
  \,.
$$

=--

See also at _[[Mayer-Vietoris sequence]]_ [this proposition](Mayer-Vietoris+sequence#SequenceFromDiagonal).

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
Since the objects are already fibrant, prop. \ref{HomotopyPullbackByOrdinaryPullback} implies that it is sufficient to replace one of the morphisms by a fibrant resolution.
Such a resolution is provided by the [[factorization lemma]]: by [Lemma 3](factorization+lemma#FibrantResolution), $B \to C$ admits a canonical fibrant resolution
  $$ C^I \times_C B \twoheadrightarrow C $$
where $C \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} C^I \to C \times C$ is a [[path space object]] for $C$ (for instance, when $C$ is a [[closed monoidal homotopical category]] then this can be taken to be the [[internal hom]] with an [[interval object]] $I$).
=--

The homotopy pullback constructed in this way is an example of a _strict homotopy limit_, as mentioned at [[homotopy limit]].  In such a case, one can say that an arbitrary homotopy-commutative square

$$
  \array{
   W & \to& Y
   \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
   \\
   X &\to& Z
  }
$$

is a homotopy pullback square if the induced morphism from $W$ to the strict homotopy pullback is a [[weak equivalence]].



Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[category of fibrant objects]], such as the category $KanCplx \hookrightarrow sSet$ of [[Kan complexes]] or the category [[Top]] of ([[convenient category of topological spaces|convenient]]) [[topological spaces]].

###### Lemma
Given any [[product]]
  $$ X \overset{p_{X}}{\leftarrow} X \times Y
       \overset{p_{Y}}{\rightarrow} Y $$
in $\mathcal{C}$, the [[projections]] $p_{X}$ and $p_{Y}$ are [[fibrations]].
=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By one of the axioms for a category of fibrant objects, $\mathcal{C}$ has a final object $1$. We have the following.

1) The following diagram in $\mathcal{C}$ is a cartesian square.

$$
   \array{
      X \times Y               &  \overset{p_{Y}}{\to} & Y \\
      p_{X} \downarrow &                                      & \downarrow  \\
      X                            & \to                                 & 1 \\ 
   }
$$

2) By one of the axioms for a category of fibrant objects, the arrows $Y \to 1$ and $X \to 1$ are fibrations. 

By one of the axioms for a category of fibrant objects, it follows from 1) and 2) that $p_{X}$ and $p_{Y}$ are fibrations.

+-- {: .num_lemma}
###### Lemma
Given an object $X$ in $\mathcal{C}$, let $X^I$ be a [[path space object]] for $X$ and let
  $$ d = (d_0, d_1) : X^I \twoheadrightarrow X \times X $$
denote the canonical [[fibration]].
The morphisms $d_0 : X^I \to X$ and $d_1 : X^I \to X$ are both [[trivial fibrations]].
=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We have the following.

1) The following diagram in $\mathcal{C}$ commutes.

$$
   \array{
      X &  \overset{i}{\hookrightarrow}                                         & X^I \\
          &    \underset{id_X}{\searrow}                    & \downarrow d_{0} \\

   }
$$

2) By one of the axioms for a category of fibrant objects, $id_X$ is a weak equivalence. 

By the 2-out-of-3 axiom for a category of fibrant objects, we deduce from 1), 2), and the fact that $c$ is a weak equivalence, that $d_{0}$ is a weak equivalence.

An entirely analogous argument demonstrates that $d_{1}$ is a weak equivalence.

The **[[factorization lemma]]**

+-- {: .num_lemma #FibrantResolution}
###### Lemma
**(Fibrant resolution of a morphism).**
Let $f : X \to Y$ a morphism in $\mathcal{C}$.  There exists a canonical [[fibration]] $g : X \times_Y Y^I \twoheadrightarrow Y$ which factors through $f$ via a [[trivial fibration]] $s: X \times_Y Y^I \stackrel{\sim}{\twoheadrightarrow} X$.
Here $Y^I$ is a [[path space object]] for $Y$.

$$
   \array{
      X \times_Y Y^I & \overset{s}{\to} & X \\
          & \underset{g}{\searrow} & \downarrow{f} \\
          & & Y 
   }
$$
=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
Let $d = (d_0, d_1) : Y^I \twoheadrightarrow Y \times Y$ be the canonical [[fibration]].  Let $s : X \times_Y Y^I \stackrel{\sim}{\twoheadrightarrow} X$ denote the [[base change]] of $d_0$ along $f$; this is a [[trivial fibration]] because $d_0$ is by lemma 2, and trivial fibrations are stable under base change.

Let $g$ denote the composite
  $$ g : X \times_Y Y^I \to Y^I \stackrel{d_1}{\twoheadrightarrow} Y. $$
One can see that this is a fibration by observing that it is the same as the composite
  $$ X \times_Y Y^I \to X \times_Y Y \times Y = X \times Y \to X \times e = X $$
where $e$ is the [[final object]] of $C$.
Here, the first morphism $id_X \times_Y d$ is a fibration because it is a base change of the fibration $d$; the second is a fibration because it is a base change of the fibration $Y \to e$ ($Y$ is [[fibrant object|fibrant]]).

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition
**(Factorization lemma).**
Any morphism $f : X \to Y$ in $\mathcal{C}$ admits a factorization as a [[weak equivalence]] $i$ followed by a [[fibration]] $p$, such that $i$ is [[right inverse]] to a [[trivial fibration]].
$$
   \array{
      X &  \overset{i}{\to}             & \hat X \\
          & \underset{f}{\searrow} & \downarrow p \\
          &                                        & Y 
   }
$$
=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
Let $p : \hat X = X \times_Y Y^I \twoheadrightarrow Y$ be a [[fibration|fibrant]] resolution of $f$ as in Lemma 3, so that there is a commutative diagram
$$
   \array{
      \hat X & \overset{s}{\to} & X \\
          & \underset{p}{\searrow} & \downarrow{f} \\
          & & Y 
   }
$$
Let $j : Y \stackrel{\sim}{\to} Y^I$ denote the canonical [[weak equivalence]].  Since the square
$$
   \array{
      X & \overset{id_X}{\to} & X \\
      \downarrow{j f} & & \downarrow{f} \\
      Y^I & \overset{d_0}{\to} & Y
   }
$$
commutes, one gets an induced morphism $i = (id_X, j f) : X \to \hat X$ by the [[universal property]] of the [[pullback]], which by definition has left inverse $s$ and makes the diagram
$$
   \array{
      X &  \overset{i}{\to}             & \hat X \\
          & \underset{f}{\searrow} & \downarrow p \\
          &                                        & Y

$$

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

A subtlety to be aware of here is that $\Omega B$ is not quite $ker(ker(f))$, but the latter instead is $\bar \Omega f$, where $\bar \Omega$ denotes loops with reversed orientation.

A classical discussion of this in terms of computing homotopy fibers via [[path object]] fibrant replacements is e.g. in
([Switzer 75, around 2.57](#Switzer75)). But let's see it just diagrammatically:

First observe that it is indeed $\Omega f$ and not $\bar \Omega f$ that appears in the above: by "bending around" the bottom left "$\ast \to $" we get

$$
  \array{
    \Omega A &\longrightarrow& \ast
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\Omega f}} && \downarrow
    \\
    \Omega B & \longrightarrow & ker(f) &\longrightarrow& \ast
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{g}} && \downarrow
    \\
    \ast &\longrightarrow & A &\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}& B
  }
  \;\;\;\;\;
  \simeq  
  \;\;\;\;\;
  \left(
  \array{
    \ast &\longrightarrow& \ast
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    ker(f) &\longrightarrow& \ast
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{g}} && \downarrow
    \\
    A &\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}& B
    \\
    \uparrow && \uparrow
    \\
    \ast &\longrightarrow& \ast
  }
  \right)
  \stackrel{\underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}}{\mapsto}
  \left(
    \Omega A \stackrel{\Omega f}{\longrightarrow} \Omega B
  \right)
  \,.
$$

On the other hand, if we define the homotopy fiber of any morphism $\phi$ by the diagram

$$
  \array{
    ker(\phi) &\longrightarrow& \ast
    \\
    \downarrow &\swArrow& \downarrow
    \\
    & \stackrel{\phi}{\longrightarrow} & 
  }
$$

then $ker(g)$ is given by the diagram

$$
  \array{
    ker(g) &\longrightarrow& \ast
    \\
    \downarrow &\swArrow& \downarrow
    \\
    ker(f) &\stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow}& A
  }
$$

but what appears in the above pasting diagram is instead this diagram "reflected at the diagonal axis"

$$
  \array{
    ker(g) &\longrightarrow& \ast
    \\
    \downarrow &\swArrow& \downarrow
    \\
    ker(f) &\stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow}& A
  }
  \;\;\;
  \simeq
  \;\;\;
  \array{
    \Omega B &\longrightarrow& \ast
    \\
    \downarrow &\swArrow& \downarrow
    \\
    ker(f) &\stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow}& A
  }
  \;\;\;\;
  \simeq
  \;\;\;\;
  \left(
  \array{
    \Omega B &\longrightarrow& ker(f)
    \\
    \downarrow &\swArrow& \downarrow
    \\
    \ast &\longrightarrow& A
  }
  \right)^{-1}
$$

Here "$(-)^{-1}$" denotes the inverse of the [[2-morphism]] ([[homotopies]]). Since it is these 2-morphisms/homotopies that become the loops in the loop space, it is here that loop reversal appears in translating between the naive iterated homotopy fiber to the construction that actually appears in the above pasting composite.

We set up [[stable homotopy theory]].
 
**Literature.** For a decent quick idea see ([Malkiewich 14](#Malkiewich14)).
The original is still good: ([Adams 74, part III sections 2-7](#Adams74)),
except where it considers the [[stable homotopy category]] in its incarnation
as the [[Adams category]], better to consider the [[homotopy category]] of the

### Motivating theorems

The 0th approximation to making [[Ho(Top)]] become more like an [[abelian category]] is passage to [[pointed topological spaces]], and [[pointed objects|pointed]] [[simplicial sets]]:

every category of [[pointed objects]] has 

1. a [[zero object]] (the point) and [[zero morphisms]] (those factoring through the point);

1. a canonical non-Cartesian [[tensor product]], the _[[smash product]]_ $\wedge$.

Given the base point, there is the [[loop space]]-construction $\Omega(-) \simeq [S^1,-]$ on that base point. It has a [[left adjoint]], the [[reduced suspension]] operation $\Sigma(-) \simeq S^1 \wedge (-)$.

Motivation for stabilization under $(\Sigma \dashv \Omega)$:

* [[Eckmann-Hilton argument]] (...[[May recognition theorem]])

* [[Freudenthal suspension theorem]]

* [[triangulated category]]-structure on [[Spanier-Whitehead category]]

Further motivation which is the subject of the [seminar](#ComplexOrientedCohomology):

* [[generalized cohomology]]

  * [[suspension isomorphism]]

  * [[Brown representability theorem]]

* [[cobordism theory]]

  [[Thom's theorem]]




### The stable homotopy category
 {#Spectra}


The [[stable homotopy category]] is to be the proper [[stabilization]] of the classical [[homotopy category]] [[Ho(Top)]] $\simeq$ [[Ho(sSet)]] under the operation of forming [[loop space objects]] $\Omega$ and [[reduced suspensions]] $\Sigma$: via forming [[suspension spectra]] $\Sigma^\infty$ every [[pointed object]] in the classical [[homotopy category]] maps to the stable homotopy category, and under this map the [[loop space]]- and [[reduced suspension]]-[[functors]] become inverse [[equivalence of categories|equivalences]] on the stable homotopy category.

$$
  \array{
     Ho(Top)^{\ast/} 
      &
      \underoverset{\underset{\Omega}{\longrightarrow}}{\overset{\Sigma}{\longleftarrow}}{} 
      &
     Ho(Top)^{\ast/}
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\Sigma^\infty}}\downarrow \dashv \uparrow^{\mathrlap{\Omega^\infty}}
     &&
     {}^{\mathllap{\Sigma^\infty}}\downarrow \dashv \uparrow^{\mathrlap{\Omega^\infty}}
     \\
     Ho(Spectra) 
     &
     \underoverset{\underset{\Omega}{\longrightarrow}}{\overset{\Sigma}{\longleftarrow}}{\simeq}
     &
     Ho(Spectra)
  }
  \,.
$$


In contrast to the classical [[homotopy category]], the stable homotopy category is a [[triangulated category]] (a shadow of the fact that the [[(∞,1)-category of spectra]] is a [[stable (∞,1)-category]]). As such it may be thought of as a refinement of the [[derived category]] [[category of chain complexes|of chain complexes]] (of [[abelian groups]]): every [[chain complex]] gives rise to a [[spectrum]] and every [[chain map]] to a map between these spectra (the [[stable Dold-Kan correspondence]]), but there are many more spectra and maps between them than arise from chain complexes and chain maps.


There is a variety of different models for the [[stable homotopy theory]] of spectra, some of which roughly fits into a hierarchy like so:

1. [[sequential spectra]] with their [[model structure on sequential spectra]]

1. [[symmetric spectra]] with their [[model structure on symmetric spectra]]

1. [[orthogonal spectra]] with their [[model structure on orthogonal spectra]]

1. [[excisive functors]] with their [[model structure for excisive functors]]

As one moves down this list, the objects modelling the spectra become richer. This means on the one hand that their abstract properties become better as one moves down the list, on the other hand it means that it is more immediate to construct and manipulate examples as one stays further up in the list. 

We start with plain sequential spectra here as a transparent means to see the [[stable homotopy category]]. When we get to the discussion of [[ring spectra]] [below](#RingSpectra) with the basic applications in mind, it is convenient to pass to the richer model of [[symmetric spectra]].


+-- {: .num_defn #SequentialSpectrum}
###### Definition

A _[[sequential spectrum|sequential]]_ [[pre-spectrum]] in [[simplicial sets]], is an $\mathbb{N}$-[[graded object|graded]] [[pointed object|pointed]] [[simplicial set]] $X_\bullet$ equipped with morphisms $\sigma_n \colon S^1 \wedge X_n \to X_{n+1}$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, where $S^1 \coloneqq \Delta[1]/\partial\Delta[1]$ is the minimal simplicial [[circle]], and where $\wedge$ is the [[smash product]] of [[pointed objects]].

A [[homomorphism]] $f \colon X \to Y$ of sequential prespectra is a collection $f_\bullet \colon X_\bullet \to Y_\bullet$ of homomorphisms of pointed simplicial sets, such that all [[diagrams]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    S^1 \wedge X_n &\stackrel{S^1 \wedge f_n}{\longrightarrow}& S^1 \wedge Y_n

### Higher algebra
 {#RingSpectra}

**Literature.** ([Schwede 12](#Schwede12))

$\,$

Given that [[spectra]] are the analog in [[homotopy theory]] of [[abelian groups]] we now discuss algebra (the theory of [[rings]] and their [[modules]]) [[internalization|internal]] to spectra. This "[[higher algebra]]" accordingly is the theory of [[ring spectra]] and [[module spectra]].

| [[algebra]] | [[higher algebra]] |
|-------------|--------------------|
| [[abelian group]] | [[spectrum]] |
| [[ring]]    | [[ring spectrum]] |
| [[module]]  | [[module spectrum]]|

Hence where a [[ring]] is equivalently a [[monoid]] with respect to the the [[tensor product of abelian groups]], we are after a corresponding [[tensor product]] of [[spectra]]. This is to be the [[smash product of spectra]], induced by the [[smash product]] on [[pointed topological spaces]]/[[pointed object|pointed]] [[simplicial sets]].

There is a key point to be dealt with here: the [[smash product of spectra]] has to exhibit a certain _graded commutativity_. Informally, there are two ways to see this:

First, we have seen above that under the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] [[chain complexes]] yield examples of spectra. But the [[tensor product of chain complexes]] is graded commutative.

Second, more fundamentally, we see in the discussion of the [[Brown representability theorem]] ([here](#BrownRepresentabilityTheorem)) that every ([[sequential spectrum|sequential]]) [[spectrum]] $A$ induces a [[generalized homology theory]] given by the formula $X \mapsto \pi_\bullet(E \wedge X)$ (where the smash product is just the degreewise smash of pointed objects). By the [[suspension isomorphism]] this is such that for $X = S^n$ the [[n-sphere]], then $\pi_{\bullet\geq 0}(E \wedge S^n) \simeq \pi_{\bullet \geq 0}(E_n)$. This means that instead of thinking of a [[sequential spectrum]], def. \ref{SequentialSpectrum}, as indexed on the [[natural numbers]] equipped with [[addition]] $(\mathbb{N},+)$, it may be more natural to think of sequential spectra as indexed on the [[n-spheres]] equipped with their smash product of pointed spaces $(\{S^n\}_n, \wedge)$. 

While as [[monoidal categories]] these are equivalent, they differ as [[symmetric monoidal categories]]: there is an intrinsic graded-commutativity in the smash product of spheres. This is evident, but important:

+-- {: .num_prop #GradedCommutativityOfSmashOfSpheres}
###### Proposition

There are [[homeomorphisms]] between [[n-spheres]] and their [[smash products]]

$$
  \phi_{n_1,n_2}
  \;\colon\;
  S^{n_1} \wedge S^{n_2}
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  S^{n_1 + n_2}
$$

such that in [[Ho(Top)]] there are [[commuting diagrams]] like so:

$$
  \array{
    (S^{n_1} \wedge S^{n_2}) \wedge S^{n_3}
    &&\stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}&&
    S^{n_1} \wedge (S^{n_2} \wedge S^{n_3})
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\phi_{n_1,n_2} \wedge id}}\downarrow 
    && && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{id \wedge \phi_{n_2,n_3}}}
    \\
    S^{n_1+n_2} \wedge S^{n_3}
    && &&
    S^{n_1}\wedge S^{n_2 + }
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{\phi_{n_1+n_2, n_3}}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\phi_{n_1,n_2+n_3}}}
    \\
    && 
    S^{n_1+n_2 + n_3}
  }
  \,.
$$

and

$$
  \array{
    S^{n_1} \wedge S^{n_2}
    &\stackrel{b_{n_1,n_2}}{\longrightarrow}&
    S^{n_2} \wedge S^{n_1}
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\phi_{n_1,n_2}}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\phi_{n_2,n_1}}}
    \\
    S^{n_1 + n_2}
    &\stackrel{(-1)^{n_1 n_2}}{\longrightarrow}&
    S^{n_1 + n_2}
  }
  \,,
$$

where here $(-1)^n \colon S^n \to S^n$ denotes the homotopy class of a [[continuous function]] of [[degree of a continuous function|degree]] $(-1)^n \in \mathbb{Z} \simeq [S^n, S^n]$.


=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

With the [[n-sphere]] $S^n$ realized as the [[one-point compactification]] of the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$, then $\phi_{n_1,n_2}$ is given by the identity on [[coordinates]] and the [[braiding]] homeomorphism

$$
  b_{n_1,n_2}
  \;\colon\;
  S^{n_1} \wedge S^{S^2}
  \stackrel{\sigma}{\longrightarrow}
  S^{n_2} \wedge S^{n_2}
$$

is given by permuting the [[coordinates]]:

$$
  (x_1, \cdots, x_{n_1}, y_1, \cdots, y_{n_2})
  \mapsto
  (y_1, \cdots, y_{n_2}, x_1, \cdots, x_{n_1})
  \,.
$$

This has [[degree of a continuous map|degree]] $(-1)^{n_1 n_2}$ .

=--


This phenomenon suggests that if we "[[categorify]]" the [[natural numbers]] to the [[n-spheres]] and think of the $n$th component space of a [[sequential spectrum]] as being the value assigned to the [[n-sphere]]

$$
  E_n \simeq E(S^n)
$$

then there should be a possibly non-trivial [[action]] of the [[symmetric group]] $\Sigma_n$ on $E_n$, due to the fact that there is such an action of $S^n$ which is non-trivial according to prop. \ref{GradedCommutativityOfSmashOfSpheres}.

This is of course just a heuristics, but it turns out to be the right one. More fundamentally one may understand this phenomnon from the concept of [[excisive functors]] and their [[model structure for excisive functors]]. Here we will not further dwell on this but just take the above heuristics as motivation for the following variant of def. \ref{SequentialSpectrum}.

## **Interlude) Spectral sequences**
 {#SpectralSequences}

In the end, what one wants to compute in stable homotopy 
theory are [[stable homotopy groups]] of [[spectra]] that are built
from other spaces and spectra in some way. Notably one wants to 
know the homotopy groups of [[mapping spectra]] $[X,E]$ ([[generalized cohomology|generalized]] [[cohomology groups]] $E^\bullet(X) \coloneqq \pi_\bullet([X,E])$)
and of [[smash products of spectra]] $E \wedge X$ ([[generalized homology|generalized]] [[homology groups]] $E_\bullet(X)\coloneqq \pi_\bullet(E \wedge X)$).

In general the only practicable way to carry out such computations is by doing them along a decomposition of the given spectrum into a "sequence of stages" of sorts. The concept of _[[spectral sequence]]_ is what formalizes this idea.

(Here the re-occurence of the root "spectr-" it is a historical coincidence, but a lucky one.)


### For filtered complexes
 {#SpectralSequencesForFilteredChainComplexes}

We begin with recalling basics of [[ordinary cohomology|ordinary]] _[[relative homology]]_ and then seamlessly derive the notion of _[[spectral sequences]]_ from that as the natural way of computing the ordinary cohomology of a [[CW-complex]] stagewise from the relative cohomology of its [[simplicial skeleton|skeleta]]. This is meant as motivation and warmup. What we are mostly going to use further below are spectral sequences induced by [[filtered spectra]], this we turn to [next](#SpectralSequencesForFilteredSpectra).

$\,$


Let $X$ be a [[topological space]] and $A \hookrightarrow X$ a [[topological subspace]]. Write $C_\bullet(X)$ for the [[chain complex]] of [[singular homology]] on $X$ and $C_\bullet(A) \hookrightarrow C_\bullet(X)$ for the [[chain map]] induced by the subspace inclusion.

+-- {: .num_defn #RelativeSingularHomology}
###### Definition

The (degreewise) [[nLab:cokernel]] of this inclusion, hence the [[quotient]] $C_\bullet(X)/C_\bullet(A)$ of $C_\bullet(X)$ by the [[image]] of $C_\bullet(A)$ under the inclusion, is the **chain complex of $A$-relative singular chains**. 

* A [[nLab:boundary]] in this quotient is called an **$A$-relative singular boundary**, 

* a [[nLab:cycle]] is called an **$A$-relative singular cycle**.

* The [[nLab:chain homology]] of the quotient is the **$A$-relative singular homology of $X$**

  $$
    H_n(X , A)\coloneqq H_n(C_\bullet(X)/C_\bullet(A))
    \,.
  $$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

This means that a singular $(n+1)$-chain $c \in C_{n+1}(X)$ is an $A$-relative cycle precisely if its [[nLab:boundary]] $\partial c \in C_{n}(X)$ is, while not necessarily 0, contained in the $n$-chains of $A$: $\partial c \in C_n(A) \hookrightarrow C_n(X)$. So the boundary vanishes possibly only "up to contributions coming from $A$".

###### Definition

The **[[nLab:augmentation]] map** for the [[nLab:singular homology]] of $X$ is the [[nLab:homomorphism]] of [[nLab:abelian groups]]

which adds up all the coefficients of all 0-chains:

$$
  \epsilon \colon \colon \sum_{i} n_i \sigma_i \mapsto \sum_i n_i
  \,.
$$

Since the [[nLab:boundary]] of a 1-chain is in the [[nLab:kernel]] of this map, by example \ref{BasicExamplesOfChainBoundaries}, it constitutes a [[nLab:chain map]]

$$
  \epsilon \colon C_\bullet(X) \to \mathbb{Z}

where now $\mathbb{Z}$ is regarded as a chain complex concentrated in degree 0.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The [[nLab:homology long exact sequence]], prop. \ref{HomologyLongExactSequence}, of the defining short exact sequence $\tilde C_\bullet(C) \to C_\bullet(X) \stackrel{\epsilon}{\to} \mathbb{Z}$ is, since $\mathbb{Z}$ here is concentrated in degree 0, of the form

$$
  \cdots \to \tilde H_n(X) \to H_n(X) \to 0 \to \cdots \to 
  0 \to 
  \cdots \to \tilde H_1(X) \to H_1(X) \to 0 \to 
  \tilde H_0(X) \to H_0(X) \stackrel{\epsilon}{\to}  \mathbb{Z} \to 0 
  \,.
$$

Here [[nLab:exact sequence|exactness]] says that all the morphisms $\tilde H_n(X) \to H_n(X)$ for positive $n$ are [[nLab:isomorphisms]]. Moreover, since $\mathbb{Z}$ is a [[nLab:free abelian group]], hence a [[nLab:projective object]], the remaining [[nLab:short exact sequence]]

$$
  0 \to \tilde H_0(X) \to H_0(X) \to \mathbb{Z} \to 0
$$

is [[nLab:split exact sequence|split]], by prop. \ref{SplittingLemma}, and hence $H_0(X) \simeq \tilde H_0(X) \oplus \mathbb{Z}$.

###### Proposition

For $X = *$ the [[nLab:point]], the morphism

$$
  H_0(\epsilon) \colon H_0(X) \to \mathbb{Z}

is an [[nLab:isomorphism]]. Accordingly the reduced homology of the point vanishes in every degree:

$$
  \tilde H_\bullet(*) \simeq 0
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the discussion in section [2)](#SimplicialHomology) we have that 

$$
  H_n(*) \simeq
  \left\{
    \array{
       \mathbb{Z} & for \; n = 0
       \\
       0 & otherwise
    }
  \right.
  \,.
$$

Moreover, it is clear that $\epsilon \colon C_0(*) \to \mathbb{Z}$ is the [[nLab:identity]] map.

Now we can discuss the relation between reduced homology and relative homology.

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

For $X$ an [[nLab:inhabited set|inhabited]] [[nLab:topological space]], its [[nLab:reduced singular homology]], def. \ref{ReducedSingularChainComplex}, coincides with its [[nLab:relative singular homology]] relative to any base point $x \colon * \to X$:

$$
  \tilde H_\bullet(X)
  \simeq
   H_\bullet(X,*)
  \,.
$$


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Consider the sequence of [[nLab:topological subspace]] inclusions

$$
  \emptyset \hookrightarrow * \stackrel{x}{\hookrightarrow} X
  \,.
$$

By prop. \ref{RelativeTripleHomologyLongExactSequence} this induces a [[nLab:long exact sequence]] of the form

$$
  \cdots
  \to
  H_{n+1}(*) \to H_{n+1}(X) \to H_{n+1}(X,*)
  \to
  H_n(*) \to H_n(X) \to H_n(X,*)
  \to 
  \cdots
  \to 
  H_1(X) \to H_1(X,*) \to  H_0(*) \stackrel{H_0(x)}{\to}  H_0(X) \to H_n(X,*)
  \to 0
  \,.
$$

Here in positive degrees we have $H_n(*) \simeq 0$ and therefore [[nLab:exact sequence|exactness]] gives [[nLab:isomorphisms]]

$$
  H_n(X) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} H_n(X,*)\;\; \forall_{n \geq 1}
$$

and hence with prop. \ref{RelationBetweenReducedSingularAndSingular} isomorphisms

$$
  \tilde H_n(X) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} H_n(X,*)\;\; \forall_{n \geq 1}  
  \,.
$$

It remains to deal with the case in degree 0. To that end, observe that $H_0(x) \colon H_0(*) \to H_0(X)$ is a [[nLab:monomorphism]]: for this notice that we have a [[nLab:commuting diagram]]

$$
  \array{
     H_0(*) &\stackrel{id}{\to}& H_0(*)
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{H_0(x)}}\downarrow &{}^{\mathllap{H_0(f)}}\nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{H_0(\epsilon)}}_\simeq
     \\
     H_0(X) &\stackrel{H_0(\epsilon)}{\to}& \mathbb{Z}
  }
  \,,
$$

where $f \colon X \to *$ is the terminal map. 
That the outer square commutes means that $H_0(\epsilon) \circ H_0(x) = H_0(\epsilon)$ and hence the composite on the left is an [[nLab:isomorphism]]. This implies that $H_0(x)$ is an injection.

Therefore we have a [[nLab:short exact sequence]] as shown in the top of this diagram

$$
  \array{
    0 &\to& H_0(*) &\stackrel{H_0(x)}{\hookrightarrow}&
    H_0(X) &\stackrel{}{\to}& H_0(X,*)
    &\to&
    0
    \\
    && & {}_{\mathllap{\simeq}}\searrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{H_0(\epsilon)}} & 
   \\
   && && \mathbb{Z}
  }
  \,.
$$

Using this we finally compute

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \tilde H_0(X)
    & \coloneqq 
    ker H_0(\epsilon)
    \\
    & \simeq coker( H_0(x) )
    \\
    & \simeq H_0(X,*)
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

With this understanding of homology _relative to a point_ in hand, we can now characterize relative homology more generally.
From its definition in def. \ref{RelativeSingularHomology}, it is plausible that the relative homology group $H_n(X,A)$ provides information about the quotient topological space $X/A$. This is indeed true under mild conditions:

+-- {: .num_defn #GoodPair}
###### Definition

A [[nLab:topological subspace]] inclusion $A \hookrightarrow X$ is called a **good pair** if 

1. $A$ is [[nLab:closed subset|closed]] inside $X$;

1. $A$ has an [[nLab:neighbourhood]] $A \hookrightarrow U \hookrightarrow X$ such that $A \hookrightarrow U$ has a [[nLab:deformation retract]].

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #HomologyOfQuotientSpace}
###### Proposition

If $A \hookrightarrow X$ is a [[nLab:topological subspace]] inclusion which is _good_ in the sense of def. \ref{GoodPair}, then the $A$-relative singular homology of $X$ coincides with the [[nLab:reduced singular homology]], def. \ref{ReducedSingularChainComplex}, of the [[nLab:quotient space]] $X/A$: 

$$
  H_n(X/A)
  \simeq
  \tilde H_n(X , A)
 \,.
$$

=--

The proof of this is spelled out at _[Relative homology -- relation to quotient topological spaces](relative%20homology#RelationToQuotientTopologicalSpaces)_. It needs the proof of the _[Excision property](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/relative%20homology#Excision)_ of relative homology. While important, here we will not further dwell on this. The interested reader can find more information behind the above links.

With the general definition of relative homology in hand, we now consider the basic _cells_ such that _[[nLab:cell complexes]]_ built from such cells have tractable relative homology groups. Actually, up to [[nLab:weak homotopy equivalence]], _every_ [[nLab:Hausdorff topological space]] is given by such a [[nLab:cell complex]] and hence its relative homology, then called _[[nLab:cellular homology]]_, is a good tool for computing singular homology rather generally.

* $S^{n-1} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n} \in $ [[nLab:Top]] for the standard $(n-1)$-[[nLab:sphere]];

  (notice that the 0-sphere is the disjoint union of _two points_, $S^0 = * \coprod *$, and by definition the $(-1)$-sphere is the [[nLab:empty set]])

$$
  \tilde H_\bullet(S^n) \simeq H_\bullet(D^n, S^{n-1})

The $n$-[[nLab:sphere]] is [[nLab:homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to the $n$-[[nLab:disk]] with its entire [[nLab:boundary]] identified with a point:

$$
  S^n \simeq D^n/S^{n-1}

Moreover the boundary inclusion is a _good pair_ in the sense of def. \ref{GoodPair}. Therefore the example follows with prop. \ref{HomologyOfQuotientSpace}.

$\iota_i \colon X_i \to \vee_i X_i$ for the canonical inclusion functions.


Then for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the homomorphism

$$
  (\tilde H_n(\iota_i))_i \colon \oplus_i \tilde H_n(X_i) \to \tilde H_n(\vee_i X_i)

###### Definition

A **[[nLab:CW complex]] of [[nLab:dimension]] $(-1)$** is the [[nLab:empty set|empty]] [[nLab:topological space]].

By [[nLab:induction]], for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ a **[[nLab:CW complex]] of [[nLab:dimension]] $n$** is a [[nLab:topological space]] $X_{n}$ obtained from

1. a $CW$-complex $X_{n-1}$ of dimension $n-1$;

1. an index set $Cell(X)_n \in Set$;

1. a set of [[nLab:continuous maps]] (the **attaching maps**) $\{ f_i \colon S^{n-1} \to X_{n-1}\}_{i \in Cell(X)_n}$

as the [[nLab:pushout]] 

$$
  X_n

   \underset{j \in Cell(X)_n S^{n-1}}{\coprod} 
   X_n
$$

in

$$

    \coprod_{j \in Cell(X)_{n}} D^{n} &\to& X_{n}

hence as the topological space obtained from $X_{n-1}$ by gluing in $n$-disks $D^n$ for each $j \in Cell(X)_n$ along the given boundary inclusion $f_j \colon S^{n-1} \to X_{n-1}$.

By this construction, an $n$-dimensional CW-complex is canonically a _[[nLab:filtered topological space]]_, hence a sequence of [[nLab:topological subspace]] inclusions of the form

$$
  \emptyset \hookrightarrow X_0 \hookrightarrow X_1 \hookrightarrow \cdots \hookrightarrow X_{n-1} \hookrightarrow X_n
$$

which are the right vertical morphisms in the above pushout diagrams. 

A general **[[nLab:CW complex]]** $X$ then is a [[nLab:topological space]] which is the limiting space of a possibly infinite such sequence, hence a topological space given as the [[nLab:sequential colimit]] over a [[nLab:tower]] [[nLab:diagram]] each of whose morphisms is such a filter inclusion

The following basic facts about the [[nLab:singular homology]] of [[nLab:CW complexes]] are important.



Now we can state a variant of singular homology adapted to CW complexes which admits a more systematic way of computing its homology groups. First we observe the following.

+-- {: .num_prop #SkeletalRelativeSingularHomologyOfCW}
###### Proposition

The [[nLab:relative singular homology]], def. \ref{RelativeSingularHomology}, of the filtering degrees of a [[nLab:CW complex]] $X$, def. \ref{CWComplex}, is

$$
  H_n(X_k , X_{k-1})

where $\mathbb{Z}[Cells(X)_n]$ denotes the [[nLab:free abelian group]] on the set of $n$-cells.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The inclusion $X_{k-1} \hookrightarrow X_k$ is a _good pair_ in the sense of def. \ref{GoodPair}. The quotient $X_k/X_{k-1}$ is by definition of CW-complexes a [[nLab:wedge sum]], def. \ref{WedgeSum}, of $k$-[[nLab:spheres]], one for each element in $Cell(X)_k$. Therefore by prop. \ref{HomologyOfQuotientSpace} we have an isomorphism $H_n(X_k , X_{k-1}) \simeq \tilde H_n( X_k / X_{k-1})$ with the [[nLab:reduced homology]] of this wedge sum. The statement then follows by the respect of reduced homology for wedge sums, prop. \ref{ReducedHomologyRespectsWedgeSum}.

+-- {: .num_prop #SingularHomologyOfCWComples} 
###### Proposition

For $X$ a [[nLab:CW complex]] with skeletal filtration $\{X_n\}_n$ as above, and with $k,n \in \mathbb{N}$ we have for the [[nLab:singular homology]] of $X$ that

$$
  (k \gt n) \Rightarrow (H_k(X_n) \simeq 0)
  \,.
$$

In particular if $X$ is a CW-complex of finite [[nLab:dimension]] $dim X$ (the maximum degree of cells), then 

$$
  (k \gt dim X) \Rightarrow (H_k(X) \simeq 0).
$$

Moreover, for $k \lt n$ the inclusion

$$
  H_k(X_n) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} H_k(X)
$$

is an [[nLab:isomorphism]] and for $k = n$ we have an isomorphism

$$
  image(H_n(X_n) \to H_n(X)) \simeq H_n(X)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the [[nLab:long exact sequence]] in [[nLab:relative homology]], prop. \ref{RelativeHomologyLongExactSequence} we have an [[nLab:exact sequence]] of the form

$$
  H_{k+1}(X_n , X_{n-1})
  \to 
  H_k(X_{n-1})
  \to 
  H_k(X_n)
  \to 
  H_k(X_n, X_{n-1})
  \,.
$$

Now by prop. \ref{SkeletalRelativeSingularHomologyOfCW} the leftmost and rightmost homology groups here vanish when $k \neq n$ and $k \neq n-1$ and hence exactness implies that

$$
  H_k(X_{n-1})
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  H_k(X_n)
$$

is an [[nLab:isomorphism]] for $k \neq n,n-1$. This implies the first claims by [[nLab:induction]] on $n$.

Finally for the last claim use that the above exact sequence gives

$$
  H_{n-1+1}(X_n , X_{n-1})
  \to 
  H_{n-1}(X_{n-1})
  \to 
  H_{n-1}(X_n)
  \to 
  0
$$

and hence that with the above the map $H_{n-1}(X_{n-1}) \to H_{n-1}(X)$ is surjective.

On representative singular [[nLab:chains]] the morphism $i_n$ acts as the identity and hence $\partial^{CW}_{n} \circ \partial^{CW}_{n+1}$ acts as the double singular boundary, $\partial_{n} \circ \partial_{n+1} = 0$.

###### Remark

This means that

* a **cellular $n$-chain** is a singular $n$-chain required to sit in filtering degree $n$, hence in $X_n \hookrightarrow X$;

* a **cellular $n$-cycle** is a singular $n$-chain whose singular boundary is not necessarily 0, but is contained in filtering degree $(n-2)$, hence in $X_{n-2} \hookrightarrow X$.

* a **cellular $n$-boundary** is a singular $n$-chain which is the boundary of a singular $(n+1)$-chain coming from filtering degree $(n+1)$.

This kind of situation -- chains that are cycles only up to lower filtering degree and boundaries that come from specified higher filtering degree -- has an evident generalization to higher relative filtering degrees. And in this greater generality the concept is of great practical relevance. Therefore before discussing cellular homology further now, we consider this more general "higher-order relative homology" that it suggests (namely the formalism of [[nLab:spectral sequences]]). After establishing a few fundamental facts about that we will come back in prop. \ref{SpectralSequenceOfCWComplex} below to analyse the above cellular situation using this conceptual tool.

1. $[\cdots \stackrel{\partial_{n}}{\to} C_n \stackrel{\partial_{n-1}}{\to} C_{n-1} \to \cdots]$ is a [[nLab:chain complex]], hence $\{C_n\}$ are [[nLab:objects]] in $\mathcal{A}$ ($R$-[[nLab:modules]]) and $\{\partial_n\}$ are [[nLab:morphisms]] (module [[nLab:homomorphisms]]) with $\partial_{n+1} \circ \partial_{n} = 0$;

1. For each $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ there is a [[nLab:filtered object|filtering]] $F_\bullet C_n$ on $C_n$ and all these filterings are compatible with the [[nLab:differentials]] in that 

   $$
     \partial(F_p C_n) \subset F_p C_{n-1}
   $$

1. The grading associated to the filtering is such that the $p$-graded elements are those in the [[nLab:quotient]]

   $$
     G_p C_n \coloneqq \frac{F_p C_n}{ F_{p-1} C_n}
     \,.
   $$

   Since the differentials respect the grading we have chain complexes $G_p C_\bullet$ in each filtering degree $p$.

=--

Hence elements in a filtered chain complex are **[[nLab:bigraded object|bi-graded]]**: they carry a degree as elements of $C_\bullet$ as usual, but now they also carry a filtering degree: for $p,q \in \mathbb{Z}$ we therefore also write

$$
  C_{p,q} \coloneqq F_p C_{p+q}
$$

and call this the collection of **$(p,q)$-chains** in the filtered chain complex.

Accordingly we have $(p,q)$-cycles and -boundaries. But for these we may furthermore refine to a notion where also the filtering degree of the boundaries is constrained:


+-- {: .num_defn #AlmostChainsCyclesBoundaries}
###### Definition

Let $F_\bullet C_\bullet$ be a [[nLab:filtered chain complex]].  Its [[nLab:associated graded]] chain complex is the set of chain complexes

$$
  G_p C_\bullet \coloneqq F_p C_\bullet / F_{p-1} C_\bullet
$$

for all $p$. 

Then for $r, p, q \in \mathbb{Z}$ we say that

1. $G_p C_{p+q}$ is the module of ***$(p,q)$-[[nLab:chains]]*** or of ***$(p+q)$-chains in filtering degree $p$***;

1. $\begin{aligned} Z^r_{p,q}  & \coloneqq \left\{ c \in G_p C_{p+q} | \partial c = 0 \, mod F_{p-r} C_{\bullet} \right\} \\ & =  \left\{ c \in F_p C_{p+q} | \partial(c) \in F_{p-r} C_{p+q-1} \right\}/ F_{p-1}C_{p+q} \end{aligned}$

   is the module of ***$r$-almost $(p,q)$-[[nLab:cycles]]*** (the $(p+q)$-chains whose differential vanishes modulo terms of filtering degree $p-r$);


1. $B^{r}_{p,q} \coloneqq \partial(F_{p+r-1} C_{p+q+1}) \,,$

   is the module of **$r$-almost $(p,q)$-[[nLab:boundaries]]**.

=--

Similarly we set

$$
  Z^\infty_{p,q} \coloneqq \{c \in F_p C_{p + q} | \partial c = 0 \}/F_{p-1}C_{p+q}
  = 
  Z(G_p C_{p+q})
$$

$$
  B^\infty_{p,q} \coloneqq \partial( F_p C_{p+q+1} )
  \,.
$$

From this definition we immediately have that the differentials $\partial \colon C_{p+q} \to C_{p+q-1}$ restrict to the $r$-almost cycles as follows:

+-- {: .num_prop #DifferentialsOnAlmostChains}
###### Proposition

The [[nLab:differentials]] of $C_\bullet$ restrict on $r$-almost cycles to homomorphisms of the form

$$
  \partial^r 
   \colon
  Z^r_{p,q}
  \to
  Z^r_{p-r, q+r-1}
  \,.
$$

These are still [[nLab:differentials]]: $\partial^2 = 0$.

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the very definition of $Z^r_{p,q}$ it consists of elements in filtering degree $p$ on which $\partial$ decreases the filtering degree to $p-r$. Also by definition of differential on a chain complex, $\partial$ decreases the actual degree $p+q$ by one. This explains that $\partial$ restricted to $Z^r_{p,q}$ lands in $Z^\bullet_{p-r,q+r-1}$. 
Now the image constists indeed of actual boundaries, not just $r$-almost boundaries. But since actual boundaries are in particular $r$-almost boundaries, we may take the [[nLab:codomain]] to be $Z^r_{p-r,q+r-1}$.

=--

As before, we will in general index these differentials by their [[nLab:codomain]] and hence write in more detail

$$
  \partial^r 
   \colon
  Z^r_{p,q}
  \to
  Z^r_{p-r, q+r-1}
  \,.
$$


+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

We have a sequence of canonical inclusions

$$
  B^0_{p,q}
  \hookrightarrow
  B^1_{p,q}
  \hookrightarrow
  \cdots
  B^\infty_{p,q}
  \hookrightarrow
  Z^\infty_{p,q}
  \hookrightarrow
  \cdots 
  \hookrightarrow
  Z^1_{p,q}
  \hookrightarrow
  Z^0_{p,q}
  \,.
$$

The following observation is elementary, and yet this is what drives the theory of [[nLab:spectral sequences]], as it shows that almost cycles may be computed iteratively by homological means themselves.

+-- {: .num_prop #KernelsInsideAlmostCycles}
###### Proposition

The $(r+1)$-almost cycles are the $\partial^r$-[[nLab:kernel]] inside the $r$-almost cycles:

$$
  Z^{r+1}_{p,q}
  \simeq 
  ker( Z^r_{p,q} \stackrel{\partial^r}{\to} Z^r_{p-r, q+r-1} )
  \,.
$$

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

An element $c \in F_p C_{p+q}$ represents 

1. an element in $Z^r_{p,q}$ if $\partial c \in F_{p-r} C_{p+q-1}$

1. an element in $Z^{r+1}_{p,q}$ if even $\partial c \in F_{p-r-1} C_{p+q-1} \hookrightarrow F_{p-r} C_{p+q-1}$.

The second condition is equivalent to $\partial c$ representing the 0-element in the quotient $F_{p-r}C_{p+q-1}/ F_{p-r-1}C_{p+q-1}$. But this is in turn equivalent to $\partial c$ being 0 in $Z^r_{p-r,q+r-1} \subset F_{p-r} C_{p+q-1} / F_{p-r-1} C_{p+q-1}$.

=--

With a definition of almost-cycles and almost-boundaries, of course we are now interested in the corresponding homology groups:

+-- {: .num_defn #ExplicitForm}
###### Definition

For $r, p, q \in \mathbb{Z}$ define the **$r$-almost $(p,q)$-[[nLab:chain homology]]** of the filtered complex to be the [[nLab:quotient]] of the $r$-almost $(p,q)$-cycles by the $r$-almost $(p,q)$-boundaries, def. \ref{AlmostChainsCyclesBoundaries}:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    E^r_{p,q}
    & \coloneqq
    \frac{Z^r_{p,q}}{B^r_{p,q}}
    \\
    & = 
  \frac{
    \left\{
     x \in F_p C_{p+q} \,|\, \partial x \in F_{p-r} C_{p+q-1}
    \right\}
  }
  {
    \partial( F_{p+r-1} C_{p+q+1} ) \oplus F_{p-1} C_{p+q} 
  }
  \end{aligned}
$$

By prop. \ref{DifferentialsOnAlmostChains} the differentials of $C_\bullet$ restrict on the $r$-almost homology groups to maps

$$
  \partial^r : E^r_{p,q} \to E^r_{p-r, q+r - 1}
  \,.
$$


=--

The central property of these $r$-almost homology groups now is their following iterative homological characterization.


+-- {: .num_prop #ExplicitDefIsIndeedSpectralSequ}
###### Proposition

With definition \ref{ExplicitForm} we have that
$E^{r+1}_{\bullet, \bullet}$ is the $\partial^r$-[[nLab:chain homology]] of $E^r_{\bullet, \bullet}$:

$$
  E^{r+1}_{p,q} 
  = 
 \frac{
    ker(\partial^r : E^r_{p,q} \to E^r_{p-r, q+r-1})
  }{
    im( \partial^r : E^r_{p+r, q-r+1} \to E^r_{p,q} )
  }
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By prop. \ref{KernelsInsideAlmostCycles}.

=--

This structure on the collection of $r$-almost cycles of a filtered chain complex thus obtained is called a _[[nLab:spectral sequence]]_:

+-- {: .num_defn #SpectralSequence}
###### Definition

A **homology spectral sequence** of $R$-[[nLab:modules]] is

1. a set $\{E_{p,q}^r\}_{p,q,r \in \mathbb{Z}}$ of $R$-modules;

1. a set $\{ \partial^r_{p,q} \colon E_{p,q}^{r} \to E^r_{p-r, q+r-1} \}_{r,p,q \in \mathbb{Z}}$ of [[nLab:homomorphisms]]

such that

1. the $\partial^r$s are [[nLab:differentials]]: $\forall_{p,q,r}  (\partial^r_{p-r,q+r-1} \circ \partial^r_{p,q} = 0)$;

1. the modules $E^{r+1}_{p,q}$ are the $\partial^r$-[[nLab:homology]] of the modules in relative degree $r$:

   $$
     \forall_{r,p,q} 
     \left(
       E^{r+1}_{p,q} \simeq \frac{ker(\partial^r_{p-r,q+r-1})}{im(\partial^r_{p, q})}
      \right)
     \,.
   $$ 

One says that $E^r_{\bullet,\bullet}$ is the **$r$-page** of the spectral sequence. 

=--

Since this turns out to be a useful structure to make explicit, as the above motivation should already indicate, one introduces the following terminology and basic facts to talk about spectral sequences.


+-- {: .num_defn #LimitTerm}
###### Definition

Let $\{E^r_{p,q}\}_{r,p,q}$ be a [[nLab:spectral sequence]], def. \ref{SpectralSequence}, such that for each $p,q$ there is $r(p,q)$ such that for all $r \geq r(p,q)$ we have

$$
  E^{r \geq r(p,q)}_{p,q} \simeq E^{r(p,q)}_{p,q}
  \,.
$$

Then one says that

1. the [[nLab:bigraded object]]

   $$
     E^\infty 
      \coloneqq 
     \{E^\infty_{p,q}\}_{p,q} \coloneqq \{ E^{r(p,q)}_{p,q} \}_{p,q}
   $$

   is the **limit term** of the spectral sequence;

*  the spectral sequence **abuts** to $E^\infty$.

=--

+-- {: .num_example #Degeneration}
###### Example

If for a spectral sequence there is $r_s$ such that all [[nLab:differentials]] on pages after $r_s$ vanish, $\partial^{r \geq r_s} = 0$, then $\{E^{r_s}\}_{p,q}$ is a limit term for the spectral sequence. One says in this cases that the spectral sequence **degenerates** at $r_s$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the defining relation

$$
  E^{r+1}_{p,q} \simeq ker(\partial^r_{p-r,q+r-1})/im(\partial^r_{p,q}) = E^r_{pq}
$$

the spectral sequence becomes constant in $r$ from $r_s$ on if all the differentials vanish, so that $ker(\partial^r_{p,q}) = E^r_{p,q}$ for all $p,q$.

=--


+-- {: .num_example #Collaps}
###### Example

If for a [[nLab:spectral sequence]] $\{E^r_{p,q}\}_{r,p,q}$ there is $r_s \geq 2$ such that the $r_s$th page is concentrated in a single row or a single column, then the spectral sequence degenerates on this pages, example \ref{Degeneration}, hence this page is a limit term, def. \ref{LimitTerm}. One says in this case that the spectral sequence **collapses** on this page.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

For $r \geq 2$ the [[nLab:differentials]] of the spectral sequence

$$
  \partial^r \colon E^r_{p,q} \to E^r_{p-r, q+r-1}
$$ 

have [[nLab:domain]] and [[nLab:codomain]] necessarily in different rows an columns (while for $r = 1$ both are in the same row and for $r = 0$ both coincide). Therefore if all but one row or column vanish, then all these differentials vanish.

=--


+-- {: .num_defn #Convergence}
###### Definition

A [[nLab:spectral sequence]] $\{E^r_{p,q}\}_{r,p,q}$ is said to **converge** to a [[nLab:graded object]] $H_\bullet$ with [[nLab:filtered chain complex|filtering]] $F_\bullet H_\bullet$, traditionally denoted

$$
  E^r_{p,q} \Rightarrow H_\bullet
  \,,
$$

if the [[nLab:associated graded]] complex $\{G_p H_{p+q}\}_{p,q} \coloneqq \{F_p H_{p+q} / F_{p-1} H_{p+q}\}$ of $H$ is the limit term of $E$, def. \ref{LimitTerm}:

###### Remark

In practice spectral sequences are often referred to via their first non-trivial page, often also the page at which it collapses, def. \ref{Collaps}, often already the second page. Then one tends to use notation such as

$$
  E^2_{p,q} \Rightarrow H_\bullet
$$

to be read as "There is a spectral sequence whose second page is as shown on the left and which converges to a filtered object as shown on the right."

+-- {: .num_defn #BoundedSpectralSequence}
###### Definition

A spectral sequence $\{E^r_{p,q}\}$ is called a **bounded spectral sequence** if for all $n,r \in \mathbb{Z}$ the number of non-vanishing terms of total degree $n$, hence of the form $E^r_{k,n-k}$, is finite.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #QuadrantSpectralSequence}
###### Example

A [[nLab:spectral sequence]] $\{E^r_{p,q}\}$ is called

* a **first quadrant spectral sequence** if all terms except possibly for $p,q \geq 0$ vanish;

* a **third quadrant spectral sequence** if all terms except possibly for $p,q \leq 0$ vanish.

Such spectral sequences are bounded, def. \ref{BoundedSpectralSequence}.

=--



+-- {: .num_prop #BoundedSpectralSequenceHasLimitTerm}
###### Proposition

A bounded spectral sequence, def. \ref{BoundedSpectralSequence}, has a limit term, def. \ref{LimitTerm}.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First notice that if a spectral sequence has at most $N$ non-vanishing terms of total degree $n$ on page $r$, then all the following pages have at most at these positions non-vanishing terms, too, since these are the homologies of the previous terms.

Therefore for a bounded spectral sequence for each $n$ there is $L(n) \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $E^r_{p,n-p} = 0$ for all $p \leq L(n)$ and all $r$. Similarly there is $T(n) \in \mathbb{Z}$ such $E^r_{n-q,q} = 0$ for all $q \leq T(n)$ and all $r$.

We claim then that the limit term of the bounded spectral sequence is in position $(p,q)$ given by the value $E^r_{p,q}$ for 

$$
  r \gt max(  p-L(p+q-1), q + 1 - L(p+q+1) )
  \,.
$$

This is because for such $r$ we have

1. $E^r_{p-r, q+r-1} = 0$ because $p-r \lt L(p+q-1)$, and hence the [[nLab:kernel]] $ker(\partial^r_{p-r,q+r-1}) = 0$ vanishes;

1. $E^r_{p+r, q-r+1} = 0$ because $q-r + 1 \lt T(p+q+1)$, and hence the [[nLab:image]] $im(\partial^r_{p,q}) = 0$ vanishes.

Therefore

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    E^{r+1}_{p,q} 
    &= 
    ker(\partial^r_{p-r,q+r-1})/im(\partial^r_{p,q})
    \\
    & \simeq E^r_{p,q}/0
    \\
    & \simeq E^r_{p,q}
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

The central statement about the notion of the spectral sequence of a filtered chain complex then is the following proposition. It says that the iterative computation of higher order relative homology indeed in the limit computes the genuine homology.

   \coloneqq
  image( H_\bullet(F_p C) \to H_\bullet(C) )

###### Proposition

If the [[nLab:spectral sequence of a filtered complex]] $F_\bullet C_\bullet$ of prop. \ref{ExplicitDefIsIndeedSpectralSequ} has a limit term, def. \ref{LimitTerm} then it converges, def. \ref{Convergence}, to the chain homology of $C_\bullet$

$$
  E^r_{p,q} \Rightarrow H_{p+q}(C_\bullet)
  \,,
$$

i.e. for sufficiently large $r$ we have

$$
  E^r_{p,q} \simeq G_p H_{p+q}(C) 
  \,,
$$

where on the right we have the [[nLab:associated graded object]] of the filtering of def. \ref{FilteringOnHomology}.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By assumption, there is for each $p,q$ an $r(p,q)$ such that for all $r \geq r(p,q)$ the $r$-almost cycles and $r$-almost boundaries, def. \ref{AlmostChainsCyclesBoundaries}, in $F_p C_{p+q}$ are the ordinary [[nLab:cycles]] and [[nLab:boundaries]]. Therefore for $r \geq r(p,q)$ def. \ref{ExplicitForm} gives $E^r_{p,q} \simeq G_p H_{p+q}(C)$.


=--

This says what these spectral sequences are converging to. For computations it is also important to know how they start out for low $r$. We can generally characterize $E^r_{p,q}$ for very low values of $r$ simply as follows:

+-- {: .num_prop #SpectralSequencePagesForLowr}
###### Proposition

We have

  is the [[nLab:associated graded|associated p-graded]] piece of $C_{p+q}$;

* $E^1_{p,q} = H_{p+q}(G_p C_\bullet)$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

For $r = 0$ def. \ref{ExplicitForm} restricts to

$$
  E^0_{p,q} = \frac{ F_p C_{p+q}}{F_{p-1} C_{p+q}} = G_p C_{p+q}
$$

because for $c \in F_p C_{p+q}$ we automatically also have $\partial c \in F_p C_{p+q}$ since the differential respects the filtering degree by assumption. 

For $r = 1$ def. \ref{ExplicitForm} gives 

$$
  E^1_{p,q} = \frac{\{c \in G_p C_{p+q} | \partial c = 0 \in G_p C_{p+q}\} }{\partial(F_p C_{p+q})} = H_{p+q} (G_p C_\bullet)
  \,.

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

There is, in general, a decisive difference between the homology of the associated graded complex $H_{p+q}(G_p C_\bullet)$ and the associated graded piece of the genuine homology $G_p H_{p+q}(C_\bullet)$: in the former the differentials of cycles are required to vanish only up to terms in lower degree, but in the latter they are required to vanish genuinely. The latter expression is instead the value of the spectral sequence for $r \to \infty$, see prop. \ref{ConvergingToGenuineHomology} below.

These general facts now allow us, as a first simple example for the application of [[nLab:spectral sequences]] to see transparently that the [[nLab:cellular homology]] of a CW complex, def. \ref{CellularChainComplex}, coincides with its genuine [[nLab:singular homology]].

First notice that of course the structure of a [[nLab:CW-complex]] on a [[nLab:topological space]] $X$, def. \ref{CWComplex} naturally induces on its [[nLab:singular simplicial complex]] $C_\bullet(X)$ the structure of a [[nLab:filtered chain complex]], def. \ref{FilteredChainComplex}:

$$
  E^\infty_{p,q}(X) \simeq E^2_{p,q}(X)
$$

for all $p,q$. By the third and fourth item of prop. \ref{PagesInTheSpectralSequenceOfTheFilteredSingularComplex} this non-trivial only for $q = 0$ and there it is equivalently

$$
  G_p H_{p}(X) \simeq H^{CW}_p(X)
  \,.
$$

Finally observe that $G_p H_p(X) \simeq H_p(X)$ by the definition of the filtering on the homology, def. \ref{FilteringOnHomology}, and using prop. \ref{SingularHomologyOfCWComples}.

### For filtered spectra
 {#SpectralSequencesForFilteredSpectra}

+-- {: .num_defn #FilteredSpectrum}
###### Definition

A [[filtered spectrum]] is a [[spectrum]] $X$ equipped with a sequence $X_\bullet \colon (\mathbb{N}, \gt) \longrightarrow Spectra$  of spectra of the form

$$
  \cdots 
   \longrightarrow
  X_3
    \stackrel{f_2}{\longrightarrow} 
  X_2 
    \stackrel{f_1}{\longrightarrow} 
  X_1 \stackrel{f_0}{\longrightarrow} X_0 = X 
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

More generally a [[filtered object in an (infinity,1)-category|filtering]] on an object $X$ in (stable or not) [[homotopy theory]] is a $\mathbb{Z}$-graded sequence $X_\bullet $ such that $X$ is the [[homotopy colimit]]  $X\simeq \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim} X_\bullet$. But for the present purpose we stick with the simpler special case of def. \ref{FilteredSpectrum}.

=--


+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

There is _no_ condition on the [[morphisms]] in def. \ref{FilteredSpectrum}. In particular, they are _not_ required to be [[n-monomorphisms]] or [[n-epimorphisms]] for any $n$. 

On the other hand, while they are also not explicitly required to have a presentation by [[cofibrations]] or [[fibrations]], this follows automatically: by the existence of [[model structures for spectra]], every filtering on a spectrum is equivalent to one in which all morphisms are represented by [[cofibrations]] or by [[fibrations]]. 

This means that we may think of a filtration on a spectrum $X$ in the sense of def. \ref{FilteredSpectrum} as equivalently being a [[tower of fibrations]] over $X$.

=--

The following remark \ref{UnrolledExactCoupleOfAFiltrationOnASpectrum} unravels the structure encoded in a filtration on a spectrum, and motivates the concepts of [[exact couples]] and their [[spectral sequences]] from these.


+-- {: .num_remark #UnrolledExactCoupleOfAFiltrationOnASpectrum}
###### Remark

Given a [[filtered spectrum]] as in def. \ref{FilteredSpectrum},
write $A_k$ for the [[homotopy cofiber]] of its $k$th stage, such as to obtain the diagram

$$
  \array{
   \cdots 
     &\stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}& 
   X_3 
     &\stackrel{f_2}{\longrightarrow}& 
   X_2 
     &\stackrel{f_2}{\longrightarrow} & 
   X_1 
     &\stackrel{f_1}{\longrightarrow}& 
   X
   \\
   && \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
   \\
   && A_3 && A_2 && A_1 && A_0
  }
$$

where each stage

$$
 \array{
   X_{k+1} &\stackrel{f_k}{\longrightarrow}& X_k   
   \\
   && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{cofib(f_k)}}
   \\
   && A_k
 }
$$

is a [[homotopy fiber sequence]]. 

To break this down into invariants, apply the [[stable homotopy groups]]-[[functor]]. This yields a diagram of $\mathbb{Z}$-[[graded abelian groups]] of the form

$$
  \array{
   \cdots 
     &\stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}& 
   \pi_\bullet(X_3) 
     &\stackrel{\pi_\bullet(f_2)}{\longrightarrow}& 
   \pi_\bullet(X_2) 
     &\stackrel{\pi_\bullet(f_2)}{\longrightarrow} & 
   \pi_\bullet(X_1) 
     &\stackrel{\pi_\bullet(f_1)}{\longrightarrow}& 
   \pi_\bullet(X_0)
   \\
   && \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
   \\
   && \pi_\bullet(A_3) && \pi_\bullet(A_2) && \pi_\bullet(A_1) && \pi_\bullet(A_0)
  }
  \,.
$$

By prop. \ref{LongExactSequenceofHomotopyGroups}, here each hook at stage $k$ extends to a [[long exact sequence of homotopy groups]] via [[connecting homomorphisms]] $\delta_\bullet^k$

$$
  \cdots
    \to
  \pi_{\bullet+1}(A_k)
    \stackrel{\delta_{\bullet+1}^k}{\longrightarrow}
  \pi_\bullet(X_{k+1})
    \stackrel{\pi_\bullet(f_k)}{\longrightarrow}
  \pi_\bullet(X_k)
    \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}
  \pi_\bullet(A_k)
   \stackrel{\delta_\bullet^k}{\longrightarrow}
  \pi_{\bullet-1}(X_{k+1})
  \to 
  \cdots
  \,.
$$

If we understand the [[connecting homomorphism]]

$$
  \delta_k \colon \pi_\bullet(A_k) \longrightarrow \pi_\bullet(X_{k+1})
$$

as a morphism of degree -1, then all this information fits into one diagram of the form

$$
  \array{
   \cdots 
     &\stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}& 
   \pi_\bullet(X_3) 
     &\stackrel{\pi_\bullet(f_2)}{\longrightarrow}& 
   \pi_\bullet(X_2) 
     &\stackrel{\pi_\bullet(f_2)}{\longrightarrow} & 
   \pi_\bullet(X_1) 
     &\stackrel{\pi_\bullet(f_1)}{\longrightarrow}& 
   \pi_\bullet(X_0)
   \\
   && 
   \downarrow &{}_{\mathllap{\delta_2}}\nwarrow & 
   \downarrow &{}_{\mathllap{\delta_1}}\nwarrow &
   \downarrow &{}_{\mathllap{\delta_0}}\nwarrow
   & \downarrow
   \\
   && \pi_\bullet(A_3) && \pi_\bullet(A_2) && \pi_\bullet(A_1) && \pi_\bullet(A_0)
  }
  \,,
$$

where each triangle is a rolled-up incarnation of a [[long exact sequence of homotopy groups]] (and in particular is _not_ a commuting diagram!).

If we furthermore consider the [[bigraded object|bigraded]] [[abelian groups]] $\pi_\bullet(X_\bullet)$ and $\pi_\bullet(A_\bullet)$, then this information may further be rolled-up to a single diagram of the form

$$
  \array{
     \pi_\bullet(X_\bullet)
       & \stackrel{\pi_\bullet(f_\bullet)}{\longrightarrow} &
     \pi_\bullet(X_\bullet)
     \\
       & {}_{\mathllap{\delta}}\nwarrow 
       & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\pi_\bullet(cofib(f_\bullet))}}
     \\
     && 
     \pi_\bullet(A_\bullet)
  }
$$

where the morphisms $\pi_\bullet(f_\bullet)$, $\pi_\bullet(cofib(f_\bullet))$ and $\delta$ have bi-degree $(0,-1)$, $(0,0)$ and $(-1,1)$, respectively.

Here it is convenient to shift the bigrading, equivalently, by setting

$$
  \mathcal{D}^{s,t} \coloneqq \pi_{t-s}(X_s)
$$

$$
  \mathcal{E}^{s,t} \coloneqq \pi_{t-s}(A_s)
  \,,
$$

because then $t$ counts the cycles of going around the triangles:

$$
  \cdots
   \to 
  \mathcal{D}^{s+1,t+1}
    \stackrel{\pi_{t-s}(f_s)}{\longrightarrow}
  \mathcal{D}^{s,t}
    \stackrel{\pi_{t-s}(cofib(f_s))}{\longrightarrow}
  \mathcal{E}^{s,t}
    \stackrel{\delta_s}{\longrightarrow}
  \mathcal{D}^{s+1,t}
    \to
  \cdots
$$

The collection of this "un-rolled" data into a single diagram of [[abelian groups]] is called the corresponding _[[exact couple]]_.

###### Definition

An _[[exact couple]]_ is a [[diagram]] (non-commuting) of [[abelian groups]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    \mathcal{D}
    &\stackrel{i}{\longrightarrow}&

$$

such that this is [[exact sequence]] exact in each position, hence such that the [[kernel]] of every [[morphism]] is the [[image]] of the preceding one.

=--


The concept of exact couple so far just collects the sequences of long exact sequences given by a filtration. Next we turn to extracting information from this sequence of sequences.

+-- {: .num_remark #Observingd1}
###### Remark

The sequence of long exact sequences in remark \ref{UnrolledExactCoupleOfAFiltrationOnASpectrum} is inter-locking, in that every $\pi_{t-s}(X_s)$ appears _twice_:

$$
  \array{
    && & \searrow && \nearrow
    \\
    && && \pi_{t-s-1}(X_{s+1})
    \\
    && & {}^{\mathllap{\delta_{t-s}^s}}\nearrow 
    && \searrow^{\mathrlap{\pi_{t-s-1}(cofib(f_{s+1}))}}
    && && && \nearrow
    \\
    && \pi_{t-s}(A_s) && \underset{def: \;\;d_1^{s,t}}{\longrightarrow} && \pi_{t-s-1}(A_{s+1})
    && \stackrel{def: \; d_1^{s+1,t}}{\longrightarrow} && \pi_{t-s-2}(A_{s+2})
    \\
    & \nearrow && && && {}_{\mathllap{\delta_{t-s-1}^{s+1}}}\searrow 
    && \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\pi_{t-s-2}(cofib(f_{s+2}))}}
    \\
    && && && && \pi_{t-s-2}(X_{s+2})
    \\
    && && && & \nearrow && \searrow
  }
$$

This gives rise to the horizontal composites $d_1^{s,t}$, as show above, and by the fact that the diagonal sequences are long exact, these are differentials: $d_1^2 = 0$, hence give a [[chain complex]]:

$$
  \array{
    \cdots & \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}
    && \pi_{t-s}(A_s) && \overset{d_1^{s,t}}{\longrightarrow} && \pi_{t-s-1}(A_{s+1})
    && \stackrel{d_1^{s+1,t}}{\longrightarrow} && \pi_{t-s-2}(A_{s+2})
    &&\longrightarrow & \cdots
  }
  \,.
$$

We read off from the interlocking long exact sequences what these differentials _mean_: an element $c \in \pi_{t-s}(A_s)$ lifts to an element $\hat c \in \pi_{t-s-1}(X_{s+2})$ precisely if $d_1 c = 0$:

$$
  \array{
    &\hat c \in & \pi_{t-s-1}(X_{s+2})
    \\
    && & \searrow^{\mathrlap{\pi_{t-s-1}(f_{s+1})}} 
    \\
    && && \pi_{t-s-1}(X_{s+1})
    \\
    && & {}^{\mathllap{\delta_{t-s}^s}}\nearrow 
    && \searrow^{\mathrlap{\pi_{t-s-1}(cofib(f_{s+1}))}}
    \\
    & c \in  & \pi_{t-s}(A_s) && \underset{d_1^{s,t}}{\longrightarrow} && \pi_{t-s-1}(A_{s+1})
  }
$$

This means that the [[cochain cohomology]] of the complex $(\pi_{\bullet}(A_\bullet), d_1)$ produces elements of $\pi_\bullet(X_\bullet)$ and hence of $\pi_\bullet(X)$.

In order to organize this observation, notice that in terms of the exact couple of remark \ref{UnrolledExactCoupleOfAFiltrationOnASpectrum}, the differential 

$$
  d_1^{s,t}  \;\coloneqq \; \pi_{t-s-1}(cofib(f_{s+1})) \circ \delta_{t-s}^s
$$

is a component of the composite

the bidegree of $i$ and $k$ is preserved, but that of $j$ increases by $(1,1)$ in each step, since

## **Part 2) Adams spectral sequences**


**Literature** We follow ([Hopkins 99, section 5](#Hopkins99)) as worked out in ([Aramian](#Aramian)). See also ([Adams 74, part III.15](#Adams74)).

The basic invariants of [[stable homotopy theory]], the [[stable homotopy groups]], are as rich and interesting as they are, in general, hard to compute. The archetypical example for this phenonemon are the [[stable homotopy groups of spheres]] $\pi_\bullet(\mathbb{S})$. More generally one is interested in the stable homotopy groups of [[mapping spectra]] $\pi_\bullet[Y,X] \simeq X^\bullet(Y)$ which are [[generalized cohomology]] [[cohomology group|groups]] of $Y$ with [[coefficients]] in $X$. As discussed above in _[Interlude: Spectral sequences](#SpectralSequences)_ the tool of choice to break such problems up into stages are [[spectral sequences]].

Where the [[Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence]] ([here](#SerreAtiyahHirzebruchSpectralSequence)) approximates $\pi_\bullet[Y,X]$ via the [[ordinary cohomology]] $\pi_\bullet(Y,H X_\bullet)$, the idea of the [[Adams spectral sequence]] is to make use of an auxiliary [[ring spectrum]] $E$ and approximate maps of spectra $Y \to X$ via their image $E_\bullet(Y) \to E_\bullet(X)$ in $E$-[[generalized homology]]. 

But in order for maps of homology groups to have a chance to retain enough information, they should be forced to be equivariant with respect to extra structure inherited by forming $E$-homology. 

For instance if $E = $ $H \mathbb{F}_2$ then the [[dual Steenrod algebra]] $\mathcal{A}$ (co-)acts on $E_\bullet(X) = H_\bullet(X,\mathbb{F}_2)$ and a necessary condition for a morphism of homology groups to come from a morphism of spectra is that it is a [[homomorphism]] with respect to this (co-action).  The classical [[Adams spectral sequence]], accordingly, approximates $[Y,X]_\bullet$ by $Hom_{\mathcal{A}}(H_\bullet(Y,\mathbb{F}_2), H_\bullet(X,\mathbb{F}_2))$. (...)

More generally, since spectra are equivalently [[module spectra]] over the [[sphere spectrum]] $\mathbb{S}$, the operation of forming $E$-homology spectra $X \mapsto E \wedge S$ is equivalently the [[extension of scalars]] along the ring unit $\mathbb{S}\longrightarrow E$. This means that the extra structure inherited by $E$-homology groups contains the information given by the further extensions along the [[cosimplicial object|cosimplicial]] diagram

$$
  \mathbb{S} \longrightarrow E \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow} E \wedge E \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow}}
  E \wedge E \wedge E
  \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow}}}
  \cdots
 \,.
$$

This gives $E_\bullet(X)$ the structure of a [[module]] over the [[Hopf algebroid]] $\pi_\bullet(E \wedge E) = E_\bullet(E) \stackrel{\longleftarrow}{\longleftarrow} E_\bullet$. Accordingly the general $E$-[[Adams spectral sequence]] (or: [[Adams-Novikov spectral sequence]]) approximates $\pi_\bullet[Y,X]$ by $Hom_{E_\bullet(E)}(E_\bullet(Y),E_\bullet(X))$.

Fully abstractly, the [[spectral sequence]] which constitutes such an approximation is the [[Bousfield-Kan spectral sequence]] of the [[totalization]]-[[tower of homotopy fibers|tower]] of the cosimplicial spectrum $[Y, E^{\wedge^\bullet} X]$. Below we give a semi-classical construction, following ([Hopkins 99, section 5](#Hopkins99)).

(...)

#### $E$-Adams resolutions

The $E$-[[Adams resolutions]] in [[stable homotopy theory]] that we are about to consider behave [[analogy|analogous]] to [[injective resolutions]] in [[homological algebra]]. For a streamlined discussion of $E$-Adams resolutions it is convenient to make that analogy precise ([Miller 81](#Miller81)).

Notice that the standard concept of [[exact sequences]] and [[injective objects]] makes sense in [[abelian categories]], but not in the [[stable homotopy theory]] of [[spectra]]; for instance the true homotopy theoretic analog of exact sequences are [[homotopy fiber sequences]]. But for computational purposes we may consider a variant (due to [Miller 81](#Miller81)), where a sequence of spectra $X_\bullet$ is regarded as exact if the [[homotopical functor]] to abelian groups that it represents sends objects to standard exact sequences.  

+-- {: .num_defn #HomotopicalFunctorCoRepresentedByASpectrum}
###### Definition

For $X$ a [[spectrum]], we say that the _[[homotopical functor]]_
that it [[representable functor|co-represents]] is the functor of [[stable homotopy groups]] of the [[mapping spectrum]]-construction out of $X$, regarded as a functor on the [[stable homotopy category]]:

$$
  \pi_\bullet[X, -] \colon Ho(Spectra) \longrightarrow Ab^{\mathbb{Z}}

   is 

   1. a (long) _exact sequence_ if the induced sequence of [[homotopy functors]] according to def. \ref{HomotopicalFunctorCoRepresentedByASpectrum}, is a [[long exact sequence]] in $[HoSpectra,Ab^{\mathbb{Z}}]$;

   2. (for $n = 2$) a _short exact sequence_ if

      $$
        0 \longrightarrow A_1 \longrightarrow A_2 \longrightarrow A_3 \longrightarrow 0
      $$

      is (long) exact in the above sense;


1. a morphism $A \longrightarrow B$  is 

   1. a _monomorphism_ if $0 \longrightarrow A \longrightarrow B$ is an exact sequence in the above sense;

   1. an _epimorphism_ if $A \longrightarrow B \longrightarrow 0$ is an exact sequence in the above sense.

For $E$ a [[ring spectrum]], then a sequence of spectra is called (long/short) _$E$-exact_ and a morphism is epi/mono, respectively, if becomes long/short exact or epi/mono, respectively, after taking [[smash product of spectra|smash product]] with $E$.

We need to check that for every $X$ the morphism $i^\ast \colon [B, X]\to [A,X]$ is surjective. By retraction, given $f \colon A \to X$, then $r \circ f \colon B \stackrel{r}{\to} A \stackrel{f}{\to} X$ is a preimage.

For any spectrum $X$ the morphism

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We need to check that $E \wedge X \stackrel{id \wedge e \wedge id}{\longrightarrow} E \wedge E \wedge X$ is a monomorphism in the sense of def. \ref{ExactSequences}. Observe that this morphism has a [[retraction]] given by $\mu \wedge id$. Therefore it is a monomorphism by

###### Remark/Warning

Consecutive morphisms in an $E$-exact sequence according to def. \ref{ExactSequences} in general need not compose up to homotopy, to the [[zero morphism]]. But this does become true for sequences of $E$-injective objects, defined below in def. \ref{EInjective}.

1. If $f \colon B\longrightarrow A$ is a monomorphism in the sense of def. \ref{ExactSequences}, then there exists a morphism $g \colon C \longrightarrow A$ such that the [[wedge sum]] morphism is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]]

   $$
     f \vee g \;\colon\; B \wedge C \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} A
     \,.
   $$

   In particular, every morphism in [[Ho(Spectra)]] has an [[extension]] along a monomorphism in this sense. 

1. If $f \colon A \longrightarrow B$ is an epimorpimsm in the sense of def. \ref{ExactSequences}, then there exists a homotopy [[section]] $s \colon B\to A$, i.e. $f\circ s\simeq Id$, together with a morphism $g \colon C \to A$ such that the [[wedge sum]] morphism is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]]

   $$
     s \vee f \colon B\vee C \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} A
     \,.
   $$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Given a monomorphism $f \colon A \longrightarrow B$, consider the correspondiing [[homotopy cofiber sequence]]

$$
  A\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow} B \stackrel{r}{\longrightarrow} C  \stackrel{\delta}{\longrightarrow} \Sigma A \stackrel{-\Sigma f}{\longrightarrow} \Sigma B
  \,.
$$

We first observe that the [[connecting homomorphism]] is equivalent to the [[zero morphism]] $\delta \simeq 0$. This follows because by example \ref{HomotopyCofiberSequencesAreExactSequencesOfSpectra} the sequence

$$
  [C,X] 
    \stackrel{\delta^\ast_\bullet}{\longleftarrow} 
  [\Sigma A, X]
    \stackrel{(-\Sigma f)^\ast_\bullet}{\longleftarrow}
  [\Sigma B, X]
$$

is an [[exact sequence]] (of homotopy groups) for every $X$, while by example \ref{SuspensionPreservesExactSequencesOfSpectra} the morphism on the right is epi, so that $\delta^\ast_\bullet = 0$.

Now since $B \stackrel{r}{\longrightarrow} C \stackrel{\delta \simeq 0}{\longrightarrow}$ is also a [[homotopy fiber sequence]], the [[pasting law]] identifies $B \simeq C \times A \simeq C \vee A$:

$$
  \array{
    B \simeq C \times A &\longrightarrow& A &\longrightarrow& 0

+-- {: .num_lemma #EInjectiveSpectraAreRetractsOfFreeEModules}
###### Lemma

A spectrum is $E$-injective in the sense of def. \ref{EInjective}, precisely if it is a [[retract]] in [[HoSpectra]] of a free $E$-modules, hence of $E \wedge X$ for some spectrum $X$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

In one direction, assume that $S$ is $E$-injective and consider the diagram

$$
  \array{
    S &\stackrel{id}{\longrightarrow}& S
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{e \wedge id}}\downarrow
    \\
    E \wedge S
  }
  \,.
$$

By example \ref{TensoringWithUnitOfRingSpectrumIsMonomorphismOfSpectra} here the vertical morphism is an $E$-monomorphism, and so by assumption there is a lift

$$
  \array{
    S &\stackrel{id}{\longrightarrow}& S
    \\
    \downarrow & \nearrow
    \\
    E \wedge S
  }
$$

which exhibits $S$ as a retract of $E \wedge S$.

In the other direction, given a retraction $S \stackrel{\overset{r}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{s}{\longrightarrow}} E \wedge X$ we show that there exist extensions in

$$
  \array{
    A &\stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow} & S
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow 
    \\
    B
  }
$$

whenever the vertical morphism is an $E$-monomorphism. To see this, complete the extension problem to the following [[commuting diagram]]

$$
  \array{
    A &&& \stackrel{e \wedge id}{\longrightarrow} &&& E \wedge A
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow &\searrow^{\mathrlap{g}} & &&  & {}^{\mathllap{{\mu \wedge id} \atop {\circ id \wedge s g }}}\swarrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{id \wedge f}}
    \\
    && S &\stackrel{r}{\longleftarrow}& E \wedge X
    \\
    \downarrow && &&  && \downarrow
    \\
    B &&& \stackrel{e \wedge id}{\longrightarrow} &&& E \wedge B
  }
  \,.
$$

Now, since $f$ is assumed to be an $E$-monomorphism, the morphism $Eid\wedge f$ on the right is a monomorphism in the sense of def. \ref{ExactSequences}, and so by lemma \ref{CharacterizationOfEpiMonomorphismsOfSpectra} there exists an extension $h$ in 

$$
  \array{
    A &&& \stackrel{e \wedge id}{\longrightarrow} &&& E \wedge A
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow &\searrow^{\mathrlap{g}} & &&  & {}^{\mathllap{{\mu \wedge id} \atop {\circ id \wedge s g }}}\swarrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{id \wedge f}}
    \\
    && S &\stackrel{r}{\longleftarrow}& E \wedge X
    \\
    \downarrow && &&  &\nwarrow^{\mathrlap{h}}& \downarrow
    \\
    B &&& \stackrel{e \wedge id}{\longrightarrow} &&& E \wedge B
  }
  \,.
$$

By composition and commutativity, this gives the required extension of $g$ along $f$.

Given any [[spectrum]] $X$, then forming the [[smash product]] $(-)\wedge X$ with this sequence yields a sequence of the form

it is sufficient to understand the $\mathcal{E}_1$-pahe

To see that this is an isomorphism, observe that by flatness of $E$, the assignment $X \mapsto E_\bullet(E) \otimes_{\pi_\bullet(E)} E_\bullet(-)$ is a [[generalized homology]] functor, hence [[Brown representability theorem|represented]] by some spectrum. The above morphism, natural in $X$, thus constitutes a homomorphism  of generalized homology theories, and so for these to be equivalent it is sufficient to check that they induce isomorphisms on the point. This is manifestly the case.

Finally we get the claimed isomorphisms for all $n$ by [[induction]]:

This is one of the [[universal coefficient theorems]] of [[Frank Adams]] ([Adams 74, chapter III, prop. 13.5](#Adams74), [Schwede 12, chapter II, prop. 6.20](#Schwede12)).

Now given the standard $E$-Adams tower for some $X$, then applying $[Y,-]$ yields another [[tower of homotopy fibers]] whose tower spectral sequence on page one has $[Y, E^{\wedge^{\bullet}}\wedge X]$. This sits in a commuting diagram of the form

$$
  \array{
    [X,E^{\wedge^{\bullet+1}}\wedge X]

    \\
    && Hom_{\pi_\bullet(E)}(E_\bullet(X), E_\bullet(E^{\wedge^\bullet}\wedge X))

$$

where the vertical morphism is an iso since $E_\bullet(E \wedge \cdots)$ is a cofree Hopf co-module. (...)  
Now if $E$ satisfies the condition of prop. \ref{AdamsUCT}, then the diagonal morphism is an iso, too, and hence so is the top morphism.

###### Proposition

For $E$ flat, def. \ref{FlatE}, then the $\mathcal{E}_2$-page
of any $E$-Adams spectral sequence, def. \ref{EAdamsSpectralSequence}, for any $X$ is the [[Ext]] of [[Hopf algebroid]]-[[comodules]] for the [[Hopf algebroid]] structure on $E$-operations $E_\bullet(E)$ from corollary \ref{HopfAlgebroidStructureOnDualEOperations}

$$
  \mathcal{E}^{s,t}_\bullet
  \simeq
  Ext^{s,t}_{E_\bullet(E)}(E_\bullet, E_\bullet(X))
  \,,
$$

More generally, if $E$ satisfies the conditions of prop. \ref{AdamsUCT}, for $Y$ any spectrum then the $E$-Adams spectral sequence for $[Y,X]$ has as $\mathcal{E}_2$-page the

$$

By prop. \ref{UniquenessOfEAdamsSpectralSequence} it is sufficient to show this for the standard $E$-Adams resolution of prop. \ref{StandardAdamsResolutionIsIndeedAdamsResolution}. 
For that case the $\mathcal{E}_1$ is given by prop. \ref{E1PageOfStandardEAdamsSpectralSequenceIsEBarComplex}.

**Abstract.** _The [[(infinity,1)-category|category]] of [[generalized cohomology theories]] equipped with a universal "[[complex oriented cohomology theory|complex]] [[orientation in generalized cohomology|orientation]]" happens to unify within it the abstract structure theory of [[stable homotopy theory]] with the concrete richness of the [[differential topology]] of [[cobordism theory]] and of the [[arithmetic geometry]] of [[formal group laws]] (of [[higher Jacobians]]), such as [[elliptic curves]]. In the seminar we work through classical results in [[algebraic topology]], organized such as to give in the end a first glimpse of the modern picture of [[chromatic homotopy theory]]._


**Literature.** ([Kochman 96](#Kochman96)).


**Outline.** We start with two classical topics of [[algebraic topology]] that first run independently in parallel:

* [S1) Generalized cohomology](#S1GeneralizedCohomology)

* [S2) Cobordism theory](#S2CobordismTheory)

The development of either of these happens to give rise to the concept of _[[spectra]]_ and via this concept it turns out that both topics are intimately related. The unification of both is our third topic

* [S3) Complex oriented cohomology](#ComplexOrientedCohomologyTheory)

$\,$


### **Part S1) Generalized cohomology**
 {#S1GeneralizedCohomology}

**Idea.** The concept that makes [[algebraic topology]] be about methods of [[homological algebra]] applied to [[topology]] is that of [[generalized homology]] and [[generalized cohomology]]: these are [[covariant functors]] or [[contravariant functors]], respectively,

$$
  Spaces \longrightarrow Ab^{\mathbb{Z}}
$$

from (sufficiently nice) [[topological spaces]] to $\mathbb{Z}$-[[graded abelian groups]], such that a few key properties of the [[homotopy types]] of topological spaces is preserved as one passes them from [[Ho(Top)]] to the much more tractable [[abelian category]] [[Ab]].

**Literature.** ([Aguilar-Gitler-Prieto 02, chapters 7,8 and 12](#AguilarGitlerPrieto02), [Kochman 96, 3.4, 4.2](#Kochman96), [Schwede 12, II.6](#Schwede12)) 


#### Generalized cohomology functors
 {#GeneralizedHomologyAndCohomologyFunctors}

**Idea.** A [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] theory is such a contravariant functor which satisfies the key properties exhibited by [[ordinary cohomology]] (as computed for instance by [[singular cohomology]]), notably [[homotopy invariance]] and [[excision]], _except_ that its value on the point is not required to be concentrated in degree 0. Dually for [[generalized homology]]. There are two versions of the axioms, one for [[reduced cohomology]], and while not quite equivalent, they are closely related.

An important example of a generalised cohomology theory other than [[ordinary cohomology]] is [[topological K-theory]]. The other two examples of key relevance below are [[cobordism cohomology]] and [[stable cohomotopy]].

**Literature.** ([Aguilar-Gitler-Prieto 02, section 12 and section 9](#AguilarGitlerPrieto02), [Kochman 96, 3.4](#Kochman96)).



#### Brown representability theorem
 {#BrownRepresentabilityTheorem}


**Idea.** Given any [[functor]] such as the generalized (co)homology functor [above](#GeneralizedHomologyAndCohomologyFunctors), an important question to ask is whether it is a _[[representable functor]]_. Due to the $\mathbb{Z}$-grading and the [[suspension isomorphisms]], if a generalized (co)homology functor is representable at all, it must be represented by a $\mathbb{Z}$-indexed sequence of [[pointed topological spaces]] such that the [[reduced suspension]] of one is comparable to the next one in the list. This is a _[[spectrum]]_.

Whitehead observed that indeed every [[spectrum]] represents a generalized (co)homology theory.  The _[[Brown representability theorem]]_ states that, conversely, every generalized (co)homology theory is represented by a spectrum.

As a first application, [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectra]] representing [[ordinary cohomology]] may be characterized via Brown representability.

Due to [[phantom maps]], there remains a subtle difference between generalized (co)homology functors and the spectra which represent them: a little bit of information is lost as one passes from the spectrum to its cohomology functor (the [[Yoneda lemma]] does not fully apply here, since a (co)homology functor is equipped with the extra structure of the [[natural isomorphism|natural]] [[suspension isomorphism]]).

In applications and modern theory, it is mostly the spectra that matter, and hence the Brown representability theory is used to transfer extra structure on spectra to extra structure on cohomology theories. For instance a _[[multiplicative cohomology theory]]_ is one which is represented by a [[ring spectrum]].

There is a slight refinement of the concept of generalized homology functors to that of "[[excisive ∞-functors]]". These are fully equivalent to spectra.

**Literature.** ([Aguilar-Gitler-Prieto 02, section 12](#AguilarGitlerPrieto02), [Kochman 96, 3.4](#Kochman96))


#### Milnor exact sequence
 {#S2MilnorExactSequence}


**Idea.** One tool for computing [[generalized cohomology]] [[cohomology groups|groups]] via "[[inverse limits]]" are _[[Milnor exact sequences]]_. For instance the generalized cohomology of the [[classifying space]] $B U(1)$ plays a key role in the [[complex oriented cohomology]]-theory discussed [below](#ComplexOrientedCohomologyTheory), and via the equivalence $B U(1) \simeq \mathbb{C}P^\infty$ to the [[homotopy type]] of the infinite [[complex projective space]], which is the [[direct limit]] of finite dimensional projective spaces $\mathbb{C}P^n$, this is an [[inverse limit]] of the generalized cohomology groups of the $\mathbb{C}P^n$s. But what really matters here is the [[derived functor]] of the [[limit]]-operation -- the  [[homotopy limit]] -- and the [[Milnor exact sequence]] expresses how the naive limits receive corrections from higher "[[lim^1]]-terms". In practice one mostly proceeds by verifying conditions under which these corrections happen to disappear, these are the _[[Mittag-Leffler conditions]]_.

We need this for instance for the computation of [[Conner-Floyd Chern classes]] [below](#ConnerFloydChernClasses).

**Literature.** ([Goerss-Jardine 96, section VI.2](#GoerssJardine96), [Kochman 96, section 4.2](#Kochman96))


#### Serre-Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence
 {#SerreAtiyahHirzebruchSpectralSequence}

**Idea.** Another important tool for computing [[generalized cohomology]] is to reduce it to the computation of [[ordinary cohomology]] with [[coefficients]]. Given a [[generalized cohomology theory]] $E$, there is a [[spectral sequence]] known as the _[[Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence]]_ (AHSS) which serves to compute $E$-cohomology of $F$-[[fiber bundles]] over a [[simplicial complex]] $X$ in terms of [[ordinary cohomology]] with [[coefficients]] in the generalized cohomology $E^\bullet(F)$ of the fiber. For $E = $ [[HA]] this is known as the _[[Serre spectral sequence]]_.

The [[Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence]] in turn is a consequence of the "[[Cartan-Eilenberg spectral sequence]]" which arises from the [[exact couple]] of [[relative cohomology]] groups of the skeleta of the CW-complex, and whose first page is the relative cohomology groups for codimension-1 skeleta.

We need the AHSS for instance for the computation of [[Conner-Floyd Chern classes]] [below](#ConnerFloydChernClasses).

###### Definition

A _cohomology [[spectral sequence]]_ $\{E_r^{p,q}, d_r\}$ is

1. a sequence $\{E_r^{\bullet,\bullet}\}$ $r \in \mathbb{Z}$, $r \geq 2$ of [[bigraded object|bigraded]] [[abelian groups]];

1. a sequence of [[differentials]] $\{d_r \colon E_r^{\bullet,\bullet} \longrightarrow E_r^{\bullet+r, \bullet-r+1}\}$

such that 

* $H_{r+1}^{\bullet,\bullet}$ is the [[cochain cohomology]] of $d_r$:, i.e. $E_{r+1}^{\bullet, \bullet} = H(E_r^{\bullet,\bullet},d_r)$.

Given a $\mathbb{Z}$-[[graded abelian group]]_ $C^\bullet$ equipped with a decreasing [[filtration]]

$$
  C^\bullet \supset \cdots \supset F^s C^\bullet \supset F^{s+1} C^\bullet \supset \cdots \supset 0$$

such that

$$
  C^\bullet = \underset{s}{\cup} F^s C^\bullet \;\;\;\; and \;\;\;\; 0 = \underset{s}{\cap} F^s C^\bullet
$$

then the spectral sequence is said to _converge_ to  $C^\bullet$, denoted, 

$$
  E_2^{\bullet,\bullet} \Rightarrow C^\bullet
$$

if

1.  in each bidegree $(s,t)$ the sequence $\{E_r^{s,t}\}_r$ eventually becomes constant on a group 

    $E_\infty^{s,t} \coloneqq E_{\gg 1}^{s,t}$;

1. $E_\infty^{\bullet,\bullet}$ is the [[associated graded]] of the the filtered $C^\bullet$ in that

   $E_\infty^{s,t} \simeq F^s C^{s+t} / F^{s+1}C^{s+t}$.


The converging spectral sequence is called a _[[multiplicative spectral sequence]]_ if 

1. $\{E_2^{\bullet,\bullet}\}$ is equipped with the structure of a [[bigraded object]] [[associative algebra|algebra]];

1. $F^\bullet C^\bullet$ is equipped with the structure of a filtered [[graded algebra]] ($F^p C^k \cdot F^q C^l \subset F^{p+q} C^{k+l}$);

such that

1. each $d_{r}$ is a [[derivation]] with respect to the (induced) algebra structure on ${E_r^{\bullet,\bullet}}$, graded of degree 1 with respect to total degree;

1. the multiplication on $E_\infty^{\bullet,\bullet}$ is compatible with that on $C^\bullet$.

###### Definition

An _[[exact couple]]_ is three [[homomorphisms]] of [[abelian groups]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    D && \stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow} && D
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{f}}\nwarrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{h}}

such that the [[image]] of one is the [[kernel]] of the next.

$$
  im(h) = ker(f)\,,\;\;\; im(f) = ker(g)\,, \;\;\; im(g) = ker(f)
  \,.
$$

Given an exact couple, then its _derived exact couple_ is

$$

    im(g) && \stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow} && im(g)
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{f}}\nwarrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{h \circ g^{-1}}}

**(cohomological spectral sequence of an exact couple)**

Given an exact couple, def. \ref{ExactCoupleAndDerivedExactCouple}, 

$$
  \array{
    D_1 && \stackrel{g_1}{\longrightarrow} && D_1
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{f_1}}\nwarrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{h_1}}

    & {}_{\mathllap{f_2}}\nwarrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{h_2}}
    \\
    && E_2
  }
$$

is itself an exact couple. Accordingly there is induced a sequence of exact couples 

$$
  \array{
    D_r && \stackrel{g_r}{\longrightarrow} && D_r
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{f_r}}\nwarrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{h_r}}

$$
  deg(f) = (0,0)\,,\;\;\;\; deg(g) = (-1,1)\,,\;\;\; deg(h) = (1,0)

then $\{E_r^{\bullet,\bullet}, d_r\}$ with

$$
  \begin{aligned}

$$

is a cohomological spectral sequence, def. \ref{CohomologySpectralSequence}.

If for each bidegree $(s,t)$ there exists $R \gg 1$ such that for all $r \geq R$ 

1. $g \colon D^{s+R,t-R} \stackrel {\simeq}{\longrightarrow} D^{s+R -1, t-R-1}$;

1. $g\colon D^{s-R+1, t+R-2} \stackrel{0}{\longrightarrow} D^{s-R,t+R-1}$ 

then this spectral sequence converges to the [[inverse limit]] group

$$
  G^\bullet \coloneqq \underset{}{\lim}
  \left(
    \cdots \stackrel{g}{\to} D^{s,\bullet-s} \stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow} D^{s-1, \bullet - s + 1}

$$
  F^p G^\bullet \coloneqq ker(G^\bullet \to D^{p-1, \bullet - p+1})
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By exactness of the exact couple, the kernel

$$
  ker(d_{r-1}) \coloneqq ker(h \circ g^{-r+2} \circ f)
$$

consists of those elements $x$ such that $g^{-r+2} (f(x)) = g(y)$, for some $y$, hence 

$$
  ker(d_{r-1}) = f^{-1}(g^{r-1}(D^{s+r-1,t-r+1}))
  \,.
$$

By assumption there is for each $(s,t)$ an $R$ such that for all $r \geq R$ then $ker(d_{r-1})$ is independent of $r$. 

Moreover, $im(d_{r-1})$ consists of the image under $h$ of those $x$ such that $g^{r-2}(x)$ is in the image of $f$, hence (by exactness of the exact couple) such that $g^{r-2}(x)$ is in the kernel of $g$, hence such that $x$ is in the kernel of $g^{r-1}$. If $r \gt R$ then by assumption $g^{r-1} = 0$ and so then $im(d_{r-1}) = im(h)$.

It follows that

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    E_\infty^{p,n-p}
    & =
    ker(d_R)/im(d_R)
    \\
    &
    \simeq
    f^{-1}(im(g^R))/im(h)
    \\
    &
    \simeq
    im(g^R) \cap im(f)
    \\
    & 
    \simeq
    im(g^R) \cap ker(g)
  \end{aligned}
$$

where in last two steps we used once more the exactness of the exact couple.

The last group is that of elements $x \in G^n$ which map to zero in $D^{p-1,n-p+1}$ and where two such are identified if they agree in $D^{p,n-p}$, hence indeed 

$$
  E_\infty^{p,n-p} \simeq F^p G^n / F^{p+1} G^n
  \,.

+-- {: .num_prop #AHSSExistence}
###### Proposition
**(Serre-Cartan-Eilenberg-Whitehead-Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence)**

Let $A$ be a [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] functor such that $A^\bullet(\ast)$ is bounded below. Let $B$ be a [[simply connected topological space|simply connected]] finite [[CW-complex]] and let $X \stackrel{\pi}{\to} B$ be a [[fibration]] with fibers $F$. Then there is a cohomology spectral sequence, def. \ref{CohomologySpectralSequence} whose $E_2$-page is the [[ordinary cohomology]] of $B$ with [[coefficients]] in the $A$-[[generalized cohomology]] of the fiber, and which converges to the $A$-cohomology of the total space

$$
  E_2^{p,q} = 
  H^p(B, A^q(F)) \Rightarrow A^\bullet(X)
$$ 

with respect to the filtering given by

$$
  F^p A^\bullet(X) \coloneqq ker(A^\bullet(X) \to A^\bullet(X_{p-1}))
$$

where $X_{p} \coloneqq \pi^{-1}(B_{p})$ is the fiber over the $p$th stage of the [[CW-complex]] $B$.


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The [exactness axiom](generalized+%28Eilenberg-Steenrod%29+cohomology#ExactnessUnreduced) for $A$ gives an [[exact couple]], def. \ref{ExactCoupleAndDerivedExactCouple} of the form

$$
  \array{
    A^{s+t}(X_{s})
    &&
      \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow} 
    &&
    A^\bullet(X_{s})
    \\
    & \nwarrow && \swarrow
    \\
    && A^{s+t}(X_{s}, X_{s-1})
  }
$$

where we take $X_{\gg 1} = X$ and $X_{\lt 0} = \emptyset$. This immediately implies that the convergence conditions for the induced spectral sequence in prop. \ref{CohomologicalSpectralSequenceOfAnExactCouple} are met, so that we indeed have convergence to 

$$
  \lim\left(
    \cdots \stackrel{}{\to} A^\bullet(X_{s+1}) \longrightarrow A^\bullet(X_{s})
    \to \cdots
  \right)
  \simeq
  A^\bullet(X).
$$

In order to determine the $E_2$-page, we analyze the $E_1$-page:

Let $C(s)$ be the set of $s$-cells of $B$, and notice that for $\sigma \in C(s)$ then

$$
  (\pi^{-1}(\sigma), \pi^{-1}(\partial \sigma)) \simeq (D^n, S^{n-1}) \times F
  \,.
$$

This implies that 

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    E_1^{s,t}
    & \coloneqq
    A^{s+t}(X_s, X_{s-1})
    \\
    & \simeq \tilde A^{s+t}(X_s/X_{s-1})
    \\
    & \simeq \tilde A^{s+t}(\underset{\sigma \in C(n)}{\vee} S^s \wedge F_+)
    \\
    & \simeq \underset{\sigma \in C(s)}{\prod} \tilde A^{s+t}(S^s \wedge F_+)
    \\
    & \simeq \underset{\sigma \in C(s)}{\prod} \tilde A^t(F_+)
    \\
    & \simeq \underset{\sigma \in C(s)}{\prod} A^t(F)
    \\
    & \simeq C^n(B,A^t(F))
  \end{aligned}
  \,,
$$

where we used the relation to [[reduced cohomology]] $\tilde A$, and the [[wedge axiom]] and the [[suspension isomorphism]] of the latter. The last group is that of [[singular cohomology|singular cochains]] of degree $s$ on $B$ with [[coefficients]] in the group $A^t(F)$.

Hence to conclude it remains to show that on this group the differential $d_1$ coincides with the differential in the [[singular simplicial complex]]. This takes a tad of fiddling, see for instance ([Kochman 96, pages 124-125](#Kochman96)).

### **Part S2) Cobordism theory**
 {#S2CobordismTheory}

**Idea.** As one passes from [[abelian groups]] to [[spectra]], a miracle happens: even though the latter are just the proper embodiment of [[linear algebra]] in the context of [[homotopy theory]] ("[[higher algebra]]") their inspection reveals that spectra natively know about deep phenomena of [[differential topology]], [[index theory]] and in fact [[string theory]] (for instance via a close relation between _[[genera and partition functions - table|genera and partition functions]]_). 

A strong manifestation of this phenomenon comes about in [[complex oriented cohomology theory]]/[[chromatic homotopy theory]] that we eventually come to [below](#ComplexOrientedCohomologyTheory). It turns out to be higher algebra over the complex Thom spectrum [[MU]]. 

Here we first concentrate on its real avatar, the [[Thom spectrum]] [[MO]]. The seminal result of [[Thom's theorem]] says that the [[stable homotopy groups]] of [[MO]] form the [[cobordism ring]] of [[cobordism]]-[[equivalence classes]] of [[manifolds]]. In the course of discussing this _[[cobordism theory]]_ one encounters various phenomena whose complex version also governs the complex oriented cohomology theory that we are interested in [below](#ComplexOrientedCohomologyTheory).

#### Classifying spaces, $G$-Structure and Bordism
 {#ClassifyingSpaces}

**Idea.** Every [[manifold]] $X$ of [[dimension]] $n$ carries a canonical [[vector bundle]] of [[rank]] $n$: its [[tangent bundle]]. There is a [[universal vector bundle]] of rank $n$, of which all others arise by [[pullback]], up to [[isomorphism]]. The base space of this universal bundle is hence called the [[classifying space]] and denoted $B GL(n) \simeq B O(n)$ (for $O(n)$ the [[orthogonal group]]). This may be realized as the [[homotopy type]] of a [[direct limit]] of [[Grassmannian manifolds]]. In particular the tangent bundle of a manifold $X$ is classified by a map $X \longrightarrow B O(n)$, unique up to homotopy. For $G$ a [[subgroup]] of $O(n)$, then a lift of this map through the canonical map $B G \longrightarrow B O(n)$ of classifying spaces is a _[[G-structure]]_ on $X$

$$
  \array{
    && B G
    \\
    &\nearrow& \downarrow
    \\
    X &\longrightarrow& B O(n)
  }
$$ 

for instance an [[orientation]] for the inclusion $SO(n) \hookrightarrow O(n)$ of the [[special orthogonal group]], or an [[almost complex structure]] for the inclusion $U(n) \hookrightarrow O(2n)$ of the [[unitary group]].

All this generalizes, for instance from tangent bundles to [[normal bundles]] with respect to any [[embedding]]. It also behaves well with respect to passing to the [[boundary]] of manifolds, hence to [[bordism]]-classes of manifolds. This is what appears in [[Thom's theorem]] [below](#ThomTheorem).

**Literature.** ([Kochman 96, 1.3-1.4](#Kochman96))


#### Thom spectra
 {#ThomSpectra}
 
**Idea**. Given a [[vector bundle]] $V$ of rank $n$ over a [[compact topological space]], then its [[one-point compactification]] is equivalently the result of forming the bundle $D(V) \hookrightarrow V$ of unit [[n-balls]], and identifying with one single point all the boundary unit [[n-spheres]] $S(V)\hookrightarrow V$. Generally, this construction $Th(C) \coloneqq D(V)/S(V)$ is called the _[[Thom space]]_ of $V$. 

Thom spaces occur notably as codomains for would-be [[left inverses]] of [[embeddings]] of [[manifolds]] $X \hookrightarrow Y$. The _[[Pontrjagin-Thom collapse map]]_ $Y \to Th(N X)$ of such an embedding is a continuous function going the other way around, but landing not quite in $X$ but in the [[Thom space]] of the [[normal bundle]] of $X$ in $Y$. Composing this further with the classifying map of the [[normal bundle]] lands in the Thom space of the [[universal vector bundle]] over the [[classifying space]] $B O(k)$, denoted $M O(k)$. In particular in the case that $Y = S^n$ is an [[n-sphere]] (and every manifold embeds into a large enough $n$-sphere, see also at [[Whitney embedding theorem]]), the [[Pontryagin-Thom collapse map]] hence associates with every manifold an element of a [[homotopy group]] of a universal Thom space $M O(k)$.

This curious construction turns out to have excellent formal properties: as the dimension ranges, the universal Thom spaces arrange into a [[spectrum]], called the _[[Thom spectrum]]_, and the homotopy groups defined by the Pontryagin-Thom collapse pass along to the [[stable homotopy groups]] of this spectrum. 

Moreover, via [[Whitney sum]] of [[vector bundle]] the [[Thom spectrum]] naturally is a [[ring spectrum]], and under the Pontryagin-Thom collapse the [[Cartesian product]] of manifolds is compatible with this ring structure.

**Literature.** ([Kochman 96, 1.5](#Kochman96), [Schwede 12, chapter I exaple 1.16](#Schwede12))


#### Thom's theorem
 {#ThomTheorem}

**Idea.** By the [[Pontryagin-Thom collapse]] construction [above](#ThomSpectra), there is an assignment

$$
  n Manifolds \longrightarrow \pi_n(M O)
$$

which sends [[disjoint union]] and [[Cartesian product]] of manifolds to sum and product in the [[ring]] of [[stable homotopy groups]] of the [[Thom spectrum]]. One finds then that two manifolds map to the same element in $\pi_\bullet(M O)$ precisely if they are connected by a [[bordism]] as [above](#ClassifyingSpaces). The [[bordism]]-classes $\Omega_\bullet^O$ of manifolds  form a [[commutative ring]] under [[disjoint union]] and [[Cartesian product]], called the _[[bordism ring]]_, and hence Pontrjagin-Thom collapse produces a ring [[homomorphism]]

$$
  \Omega_\bullet^O \longrightarrow \pi_\bullet(M O)
  \,.
$$

[[Thom's theorem]] states that this homomorphism is an [[isomorphism]].

**Literature.** ([Kochman 96, 1.5](#Kochman96))


#### Thom isomorphism
 {#ThomIsomorphism}


**Idea.** If a [[vector bundle]] $E \stackrel{p}{\longrightarrow} X$ of [[rank]] $n$ carries a cohomology class $\omega \in H^n(Th(E),R)$  that looks fiberwise like a [[volume form]] -- a [[Thom class]] -- then the operation of pulling back from base space and then forming the [[cup product]] with this [[Thom class]] is an [[isomorphism]] on (reduced) cohomology

$$
  ( (-) \cup \omega) \circ p^\ast 
  \;\colon\;
  H^\bullet(X,R) \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} \tilde H^{\bullet+n}(Th(E),R)
  \,.
$$

This is the _[[Thom isomorphism]]_. It follow from the [[Serre spectral sequence]] (or else from the [[Leray-Hirsch theorem]]).

We need this below to compute (co)homology of universal Thom spectra $M U$ in terms of that of the [[classifying spaces]] $B U$.

Composed with pullback along the [[Pontryagin-Thom collapse map]], the Thom isomorphism produces maps in cohomology that covariantly follow the underlying maps of spaces. These "[[Umkehr maps]]" have the interpretation of [[fiber integration]] against the Thom class.


**Literature.** ([Kochman 96, 2.6](#Kochman96))



#### Orientation in generalized cohomology
 {#OrientationAndFiberIntegration}


**Idea.** From the way the [[Thom isomorphism]] via a [[Thom class]] works in [[ordinary cohomology]] (as [above](#ThomIsomorphism)), one sees what the general concept of [[orientation in generalized cohomology]] and of [[fiber integration in generalized cohomology]] is to be.

An important application is given by taking $E = $ [[KU]] to be [[topological K-theory]]. Then [[orientation in generalized cohomology|orientation]] is [[spin structure]] and fiber integration with coefficients in $E$ is [[fiber integration in K-theory]]. This is classical _[[index theory]]_.

**Literature.** ([Kochman 96, section 4.3](#Kochman96), [Adams 74, part III, section 10](#Adams74), [Lurie 10, lecture 5](#Lurie10))


$\,$

### **Part S3) Complex oriented cohomology**
 {#ComplexOrientedCohomologyTheory}



**Idea.** Given the concept of [[orientation in generalized cohomology]] as [above](#OrientationAndFiberIntegration), it is clearly of interest to consider [[cohomology theories]] $E$ such that there exists an [[orientation in generalized cohomology|orientation]]/[[Thom class]] on the [[universal vector bundle]] over any [[classifying space]] $B G$ (or rather: on its induced [[spherical fibration]]), because then _all_ $G$-[[associated bundle|associated]] [[vector bundles]] inherit an orientation.

Considering this for $G = U(n)$ the [[unitary groups]] yields the concept of _[[complex oriented cohomology theory]]_. 

It turns out that a complex orientation on a generalized cohomology theory $E$ in this sense is already given by demanding that there is a suitable generalization of the [[first Chern class]] of [[complex line bundles]] in $E$-cohomology. By the [[splitting principle]], this already implies the existence of [[generalized Chern classes]] ([[Conner-Floyd Chern classes]]) of all degrees, and these are the required universal generalized [[Thom classes]].

Where the ordinary [[first Chern class]] in [[ordinary cohomology]] is simply additive under [[tensor product]] of [[complex line bundles]], one finds that the composite of generalized first Chern classes is instead governed by more general commutative [[formal group laws]]. This phenomenon governs much of the theory to follow.

**Literature.** ([Kochman 96, section 4.3](#Kochman96), [Lurie 10, lectures 1-10](#Lurie10), [Adams 74, Part I, Part II](#Adams74)).


#### Chern classes
 {#ChernClasses}

**Idea**. In particular [[ordinary cohomology]] [[HR]] is canonically a [[complex oriented cohomology theory]]. The behaviour of general [[Conner-Floyd Chern classes]] to be discussed [below](#ConnerFloydChernClasses) follows closely the behaviour of the ordinary [[Chern classes]]. 

An ordinary [[Chern class]] is a [[characteristic class]] of [[complex vector bundles]], and since there is the [[classifying space]] $B U$ of complex vector bundles, the _universal_ Chern classes are those of the [[universal complex vector bundle]] over the [[classifying space]] $B U$, which in turn are just the [[ordinary cohomology]] classes in $H^\bullet(B U)$

These may be computed inductively by iteratively applying to the [[spherical fibrations]]

$$
  S^{2n-1} \longrightarrow B U(n-1) \longrightarrow B U(n)
$$

the [[Thom-Gysin exact sequence]], a special case of the [[Serre spectral sequence]]. 

Pullback of Chern classes along the canonical map $(B U(1))^n \longrightarrow B U(n)$ identifies them with the [[symmetric polynomials]] in the [[first Chern class]] in $H^2(B U(1))$. This is the _[[splitting principle]]_.

**Literature.** ([Kochman 96, section 2.2 and 2.3](#Kochman96), [Switzer 75, section 15.3](#Switzer75) [Lurie 10, lecture 5, prop. 6](#Lurie10))

$\,$

Let $R$ be a [[commutative ring]] and let

$$
  \array{
    S^n &\longrightarrow& E
    \\
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\pi}}
    \\
    && B
  }
$$

be a [[fiber bundle]] of [[n-spheres]] over a [[simply connected topological space|simply connected]] [[simplicial complex]]. 

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

There exists a [[Thom class]]  $c \in H^{n+1}(E; R)$ (in the [[ordinary cohomology]] of the total space with [[coefficients]] in $R$) such that the [[cup product]] operation $c \cup (-)$ sits in a [[long exact sequence]] of [[cohomology groups]] of the form

$$
  \cdots 
   \to 
   H^k(B; R) 
     \stackrel{\pi^\ast}{\longrightarrow}
   H^k(E; R)
    \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}
   H^{k-n}(B;R)
   \stackrel{c \cup (-)}{\longrightarrow}
   H^{k+1}(B; R)
   \to
   \cdots
  \,.
$$

=--

(e.g. [Switzer 75, section 15.30](#Switzer75), [Kochman 96, corollary 2.2.6](#Kochman96))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

There is the corresponding [[Serre spectral sequence]] 

$$
  E_2^{s,t}
  =
  H^s(B; H^t(S^n;R))
  \;\Rightarrow\;
  H^{s+t}(E; R)
  \,.
$$

Since the [[ordinary cohomology]] of the [[n-sphere]] [[fiber]] is concentrated in just two degees

$$
  H^t(S^n; R)
  =
  \left\{
    \array{
      R & for \; t= 0 \; and \; t = n
      \\
      0 & otherwise
    }
  \right.
$$

most terms on the $E_2$ page of this spectral sequence, and hence on all the further pages, vanish. As a consequence, the only possible non-vanishing differentials $d_r$ are those on the $(n+1)$-page, of the form

$$
  \array{
     E_{n+1}^{s,n} & \simeq & H^s(B;R)
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{d_{n+1}}}\downarrow
     \\
     E_{n+1}^{s+n+1,0} & \simeq &  H^{s+n+1}(B;R)
  }
  \,.
$$

Now since the [[coefficients]] $R$ is a [[ring]], then by prop. \ref{AHSSForMultiplicativeCohomologyIsMultiplicative} the [[Serre spectral sequence]] is [[multiplicative spectral sequence|multiplicative]] under [[cup product]] and the [[differential]] is a [[derivation]] (of total degree 1) with respect to this product.

To make use of this, write

$$
  \iota = 1 \in H^0(B;R) \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} E_{n+1}^{0,n} 
$$

for the unit in the cup product ring $H^\bullet(X;R)$, regarded as an element in the $(n+1)$-page of the spectral sequence. Notice that as such $\iota$ is not in degree 0, but in bidegree $(0,n)$, in particular $\iota$ is _not_ in $E_{n+1}^{0,0}$ and in particular is not the unit in there, and hence $d_{n+1}(\iota)$ need not vanish. Write

$$
  c \coloneqq d_{n+1}(\iota) \in E_{n+1}^{n+1,0} \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} H^{n+1}(B; R)
$$

for this element. This is the Thom class in question.

Because, notice that every element in $E_{n+1}^{\bullet,n}$ is of the form $\iota \cdot b$ for $b\in E_{n+1}^{\bullet,0} \simeq H^\bullet(B;R)$, and since $d_{n+1}$ is a [[derivation]] and vanishes on $E_{n+1}^{\bullet,0}$, it follows that its action is fixed by 

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    d_{n+1}(\iota \cdot b)
    & =
    d_{n+1}(\iota) \cdot b + (-1)^{n} \iota \cdot \underset{= 0}{\underbrace{d_{n+1}(b)}}
    \\
    & = c \cdot b
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

This shows that 

$$
  \array{
     E_{n+1}^{s,n} & \simeq & H^s(B;R)
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{d_{n+1}}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{c \cup (-)}}
     \\
     E_{n+1}^{s+n+1, 0} & \simeq & H^{s+n+1}(B;R)
  }
  \,.
$$

Hence the non-vanishing entries of the $E_\infty$-page of the spectral sequence sit in [[exact sequences]] like so

$$
  \array{
     0
     \\
     \downarrow
     \\
     E_\infty^{s,n}
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{ker(d_{n+1})}}\downarrow
     \\
     E_{n+1}^{s,n} & \simeq & H^s(B;R)
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{d_{n+1}}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{c \cup (-)}}
     \\
     E_{n+1}^{s+n+1, 0} & \simeq & H^{s+n+1}(B;R)
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{coker}(d_{n+1})}\downarrow
     \\
     E_\infty^{s+n+1,0}
     \\
     \downarrow
     \\
     0
  }  
  \,.
$$

Finally observe (lemma \ref{lemma}) that due to the sparseness of the $E_\infty$-page, there are also [[short exact sequences]] of the form

$$
  0 \to E_\infty^{s,0} \longrightarrow H^s(E; R) \longrightarrow  E_\infty^{s-n,n} \to 0
  \,.
$$

Concatenating these with the above exact sequences yields the desired [[long exact sequence]].

=--

+-- {: .num_lemma #lemma}
###### Lemma

For a cohomology [[spectral sequence]] converging to some $C^\bullet$ with the property that $E_\infty^{s,t} = 0$ unless $t = 0$ or $t = n$, then there are [[short exact sequences]] of the form

$$
  0 \to E_\infty^{s,0} \longrightarrow C^s \longrightarrow  E_\infty^{s-n,n} \to 0
  \,.
$$

=--

(e.g. [Switzer 75, p. 356](#Switzer75))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By definition of convergence the $E_{\infty}^{s,t}$ sit in [[short exact sequences]] of the form

$$
  0 \to F^{s+1}C^{s+t} \longrightarrow F^s C^{s+t} \longrightarrow E_\infty^{s,t} \to 0
  \,.
$$

So when $E_\infty^{s,t} = 0$ the left morphism here is an [[isomorphism]].

We may use this to either shift away the filtering degree

* if $t \geq n$ then $F^s C^{s+t} = F^{s}C^{s-1+t+1} \simeq F^0 C^{s-1+t+1} = F^0 C^{s+t} \simeq C^{s+t}$.

or to shift away the offset of the filtering to the total degree:

* if $0 \leq t-1 \leq n-1$ then $F^{s+1}C^{s+t} = F^{s+1}C^{s+1+t-1} = F^{s+t}C^{s+1+t-1} = F^{s+t}C^{s+t}$

* if $t \lt 0$ then $F^{s}C^{s+t} = 0$.

In particular $F^{s}C^{s} \simeq E_\infty^{s,0}$.

Hence the defining exact sequence

$$
  0 \to F^{s+1}C^{s+n} \longrightarrow F^{s}C^{s+n} \longrightarrow E_\infty^{s,n} \to 0
$$

becomes

$$
  0 \to E_\infty^{s+n,0} \longrightarrow C^{s+n} \longrightarrow E_\infty^{s,n}
 \to 0
  \,.
$$

#### Conner-Floyd Chern classes
 {#ConnerFloydChernClasses}

**Idea.** For $E$ a [[complex oriented cohomology theory]], then the generators of the $E$-[[cohomology groups]] of the [[classifying space]] $B U$ are called the _[[Conner-Floyd Chern classes]]_, in $E^\bullet(B U)$. 

Using basic properties of the classifying space $B U(1)$ via its incarnation as the infinite [[complex projective space]] $\mathbb{C}P^\infty$, one finds that the [[Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequences]]

$$
  H^p(\mathbb{C}P^n, \pi_q(E)) \Rightarrow H^\bullet(\mathbb{C}P^n)
$$

collapse right away, and that the [[inverse system]] which they form satisfies the [[Mittag-Leffler condition]]. Accordinly the [[Milnor exact sequence]] gives that the ordinary [[first Chern class]] $c_1$ generates,  over $\pi_\bullet(E)$, all Conner-Floyd classes over $B U(1)$:

$$
  E^\bullet(B U(1)) \simeq \pi_\bullet(E) [ [ c_1 ] ]
  \,.
$$

This is the key input for the discussion of [[formal group laws]] [below](#FormalGroupLaws).

Combining the [[Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence]] with the [[splitting principle]] as for ordinary Chern classes [above](#ChernClasses) yields, similarly, that in general Conner-Floyd classes are generated, over $\pi_\bullet(E)$, from the ordinary Chern classes.

Finally one checks that Conner-Floyd classes canonically serve as [[Thom classes]] for $E$-cohomology of the [[universal complex vector bundle]], therby showing that [[complex oriented cohomology theories]] are indeed canonically [[orientation in generalized cohomology|oriented]] on ([[spherical fibrations]] of) [[complex vector bundles]]. 
 
**Literature.** ([Kochman 96, section 4.3](#Kochman96) [Adams 74, part I.4, part II.2 II.4, part III.10](#Adams74), [Lurie 10, lecture 5](#Lurie10))


#### Formal group laws of first CF-Chern classes
 {#FormalGroupLaws}

**Idea.** The [[classifying space]] $B U(1)$ for [[complex line bundles]] is a [[homotopy type]] canonically equipped with commutative group structure ([[infinity-group]]-structure), corresponding to the [[tensor product]] of complex line bundles. By the above, the [[first Chern class]] of these complex line bundles generates the $E$-cohomology of $B U(1)$, it follows that the [[cohomology ring]] $E^\bullet(B U(1)) \simeq \pi_\bullet(E)[ [ c_1 ] ]$ behaves like the ring of $\pi_\bullet(E)$-valued functions on a 1-dimensional commutative [[formal group]] equipped with a canonical [[coordinate]] function $c_1$. This is called a _[[formal group law]]_ over the [[graded ring]] $\pi_\bullet(E)$. 

On abstract grounds it follows that there exists a commutative ring $L$ and a universal (1-dimensional commutative) formal group law $\ell$ over $L$. This is called the _[[Lazard ring]]_. [[Lazard's theorem]] identifies this ring concretely: it turns out to simply be the [[polynomial ring]] on generators in every even degree.

Further below this has profound implications on the structure theory for complex oriented cohomology. The [[Milnor-Quillen theorem on MU]] identifies the Lazard ring as the cohomology ring of the [[Thom spectrum]] [[MU]], and then the [[Landweber exact functor theorem]], implies that there are lots of complex oriented cohomology theories.

**Literature.** ([Kochman 96, section 4.4](#Kochman96), [Lurie 10, lectures 1 and 2](#Lurie10))


#### Complex cobordism
 {#ComplexCobordismCohomology}

**Idea.** There is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]] $\phi \colon B U(1)\stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} M U(1)$ between the [[classifying space]] for [[complex line bundles]] and the  [[Thom space]] of the [[universal vector bundle|universal complex line bundle]]. This gives an element $\pi_\ast(c_1) \in M U^2(B U(1))$ in the [[complex cobordism cohomology]] of $B U(1)$ which makes the universal complex [[Thom spectrum]] [[MU]] become a [[complex oriented cohomology theory]].

This turns out to be a [[universal complex orientation on MU]]: for every other [[ring spectrum]] $E$ there is an equivalence between complex orientations on $E$ and ring spectrum homomorphisms

$$
  \{M U \longrightarrow E\} \;\simeq\; \{complex\;orientations\;on\;E\}
  \,.
$$

Hence [[complex oriented cohomology theory]] is just [[higher algebra]] over [[MU]]. Equivalently: affine [[spectral geometry]] over $Spec(MU)$.

**Literature.** ([Schwede 12, example 1.18](#Schwede12), [Kochman 96, section 1.4, 1.5, 4.4](#Kochman96), [Lurie 10, lectures 5 and 6](#Lurie10))


#### Homology of $M U$
 {#HomologyOfMU}

**Idea.** Since, by the above, every [[complex oriented cohomology theory]] $E$ is indeed [[orientation in generalized cohomology|oriented]] over [[complex vector bundles]], there is a [[Thom isomorphism]] which reduces the computation of the $E$-[[homology of MU]], $E_\bullet(M U)$ to that of the [[classifying space]] $B U$. The homology of $B U$, in turn, may be determined by the duality with its cohomology ([[universal coefficient theorem]]) via [[Kronecker pairing]] and the induced duality of the corresponding [[Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequences]] (prop. \ref{AHSSPairing}) from the Conner-Floyed classes [above](#ConnerFloydChernClasses). Finally, via the [[Hurewicz homomorphism]]/[[Boardman homomorphism]] the homology of $M U$ gives a first approximation to the [[homotopy groups]] of [[MU]].

**Literature.** ([Kochman 96, section 2.4, 4.3](#Kochman96), [Lurie 10, lecture 7](#Lurie10))


#### Quillen's theorem on $M U$
 {#QuillenTheoremOnMU}

**Idea.** From the computation of the [[homology of MU]] [above](#HomologyOfMU) and applying the [[Boardman homomorphism]], one deduces that the [[stable homotopy groups]] $\pi_\bullet(MU)$ of [[MU]] are finitely generated. This implies that it is suffient to compute them over the [[p-adic integers]] for all primes $p$. Using the [[change of rings theorem]], this finally is obtained from inspection of the filtration in the $H\mathbb{F}_p$-[[Adams spectral sequence]] for $MU$. This is Milnor's theorem wich together with [[Lazard's theorem]] shows that there is an isomorphism of rings $L \simeq \pi_\bullet(M U)$ with the [[Lazard ring]]. Finally [[Quillen's theorem on MU]] says that this isomorphism is exhibited by the universal ring homomorphism $L \longrightarrow \pi_\bullet(M U)$ which classifies the universal complex orientation on $M U$.

**Literature.** ([Kochman 96, section 4.4](#Kochman96), [Lurie, lecture 10](#Lurie10))


#### Landweber exact functor theorem

**Idea.** By the above, every [[complex oriented cohomology theory]] induces a [[formal group law]] from its first [[Conner-Floyd Chern class]]. Moreover, [[Quillen's theorem on MU]] together with [[Lazard's theorem]] say that the [[cohomology ring]] $\pi_\bullet(M U)$ of [[complex cobordism cohomology]] [[MU]] is the classifying ring for formal group laws. 

The _[[Landweber exact functor theorem]]_ says that, conversely, forming the [[tensor product]] of [[complex cobordism cohomology theory]] ([[MU]]) with a [[Landweber exactness|Landweber exact]] [[ring]] via some [[formal group law]] yields a [[cohomology theory]], hence a [[complex oriented cohomology theory]]. 

**Literature.** ([Lurie 10, lectures 15,16](#Lurie10))

### Outlook: Geometry of $Spec(MU)$

The grand conclusion of [[Quillen's theorem on MU]] ([above](#QuillenTheoremOnMU)): [[complex oriented cohomology theory]] is essentially the [[spectral geometry]] over $Spec(M U)$, and the latter is a kind of derived version of the [[moduli stack of formal groups]] (1-dimensional commutative).

* {#Schwede12} [[Stefan Schwede]], _[[Symmetric spectra]]_, 2012 ([pdf](http://www.math.uni-bonn.de/~schwede/SymSpec-v3.pdf))

For **Interlude: Spectral sequences** a discussion streamlined for our purposes is in ([Rognes 12, section 2](#Rognes12)).

For **2) Adams spectral sequence** we follow ([Hopkins 99, section 5](#Hopkins99)) as worked out in

* {#Aramian} [[Nersés Aramian]], _The Adams spectral sequence_ ([[AramianANSS.pdf:file]])

and we take some further clues from ([Adams 74, III.15](#Adams74)).

For the **Seminar on Complex oriented cohomology** an excellent textbook to hold on to is

* {#Kochman96} [[Stanley Kochman]], chapters I - IV of _[[Bordism, Stable Homotopy and Adams Spectral Sequences]]_, AMS 1996

While this gives detailed proofs, some standard steps used are made more explicit for instance in 

* {#Switzer75} [[Robert Switzer]], _Algebraic Topology - Homotopy and Homology_, Die  Grundlehren der Mathematischen Wissenschaften in Einzeldarstellungen, Vol. 212, Springer-Verlag, New York, N. Y., 1975. 


Specifically for **S1) Generalized cohomology** a neat account is in:

* {#AguilarGitlerPrieto02} Marcelo Aguilar, [[Samuel Gitler]], Carlos Prieto, section 12 of _Algebraic topology from a homotopical viewpoint_, Springer (2002) ([toc pdf](http://tocs.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/106999419.pdf))


For **S2) Cobordism theory** an efficient collection of the highlights is in

* {#Malkiewich11} [[Cary Malkiewich]], _Unoriented cobordism and $M O$_, 2011 ([pdf](http://math.uiuc.edu/~cmalkiew/cobordism.pdf))

except that it omits proof of the [[Leray-Hirsch theorem]]/[[Serre spectral sequence]] and that of the [[Thom isomorphism]], but see the references there and see ([Kochman 96](#Kochman96), [Aguilar-Gitler-Prieto 02, section 11.7](#AguilarGitlerPrieto02)) for details.
 
For **S3) Complex oriented cohomology** besides ([Kochman 96, chapter 4](#Kochman96)) have a look at part II of 

* {#Adams74} [[Frank Adams]], _[[Stable homotopy and generalized homology]]_, Chicago Lectures in mathematics, 1974

and

* {#Lurie10} [[Jacob Lurie]], lectures 1-10 of _[[Chromatic Homotopy Theory]]_, 2010

(These overlap, pick the one that seems more inviting on first reading.)

### Further reading

For [[simplicial homotopy theory]] good sources are

* {#GoerssJardine96} [[Paul Goerss]], [[Rick Jardine]], chapter I of_[[Simplicial homotopy theory]]_, Birkhäuser, Progress in Mathematics (1996), reprinted as Modern Classics (1999)

* {#JoyalTierney05} [[André Joyal]], [[Myles Tierney]], _An introduction to simplicial homotopy theory_, 2005  ([chapter I](http://hopf.math.purdue.edu/cgi-bin/generate?/Joyal-Tierney/JT-chap-01), more notes [pdf](http://mat.uab.cat/~kock/crm/hocat/advanced-course/Quadern47.pdf))

For the restriction to the [[convenient category of topological spaces|convenient category]] of [[compacly generated topological spaces]] a good source is still

* {#Lewis78} [[Gaunce Lewis]], _Compactly generated spaces_ ([pdf](http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/MISC/GaunceApp.pdf)), appendix A of _The Stable Category and Generalized Thom Spectra_ PhD thesis Chicago, 1978


For further reading on stable homotopy theory an excellent collection is

* {#James95} [[Ioan Mackenzie James]], _[[Handbook of Algebraic Topology]]_ 1995


The modern chromatic picture originates around

* {#Hopkins99} [[Mike Hopkins]], _[[Complex oriented cohomology theories and the language of stacks]]_, 1999 

a useful survey is in

* {#Wilson13} [[Dylan Wilson]] section 1.2 of _Spectral Sequences from Sequences of Spectra: Towards the Spectrum of the Category of Spectra_ lecture at _[2013 Pre-Talbot Seminar](http://math.harvard.edu/~hirolee/pretalbot2013/)_, March 2013 ([[DylanWilsonOnANSS.pdf:file]])

and a wealth of details is in

* {#Ravenel86} [[Doug Ravenel]], _[[Complex cobordism and stable homotopy groups of spheres]]_, 1987/2003 ([pdf](http://www.math.rochester.edu/people/faculty/doug/mybooks/ravenelA1.pdf))

Further useful lecture notes pointed to above include the following:
