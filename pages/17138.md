## Introduction
 {#Introduction}

We are concerned with the theory of _[[spectra]]_ in the sense of [[algebraic topology]]: the proper generalization of [[abelian groups]] to [[homotopy theory]]. 

### 1) Stable homotopy theory
 {#StableHomotopyTheory}

A [[group]] in homotopy theory is equivalently a [[loop space]] under concatenation of loops ("[[∞-group]]"). A double loop space is a group with some commutativity structure ("[[Eckmann-Hilton argument]]"), a triple loop space has more commutativity structure, and so forth. A _spectrum_ is where this progression of [[looping and delooping]] _stabilizes_ (an "$\infty$-abelian group"). Therefore one speaks of _[[stable homotopy theory]]_:

$$
  Spaces
  \;\;
  \underoverset{(linearization)}{stabilization}{\mapsto}
  \;\;
  Spectra
  \,.
$$

Most of [[linear algebra]] and [[algebraic geometry]] passes along as [[abelian groups]] are generalized to [[spectra]] and turns into something remarkably rich, called _[[brave new algebra]]_, _[[higher algebra]]_ and _[[E-∞ geometry|spectral geometry]]_. In particular the analog of the theory of ([[commutative ring|commutative]]) [[rings]] and their [[modules]] exist, given by ([[commutative ring spectrum|commutative]]) [[ring spectra]] ([[E-∞ rings]], [[A-∞ rings]]) and [[module spectra]] ([[∞-modules]]). 

### 2) Adams spectral sequences
 {#ANSS}

Since spectra are considerably richer than abelian groups, stable homotopy is much concerned with "[[fracture theorem|fracturing]]" stable homotopy types into more tractable components:

To that end, notice that from the point of view of [[arithmetic geometry]], an [[abelian group]] $A$ is equivalently a [[quasicoherent sheaf]] over [[Spec(Z)]]. 

$$
  AbelianGroups \simeq QCoh(Spec(\mathbb{Z}))
  \,.
$$

This point of view generalizes to homotopy theory and turns out to be very fruitful there. The analog of the [[integers]] $\mathbb{Z}$ is the [[sphere spectrum]] $\mathbb{S}$, and this is naturally the [[initial object in an (infinity,1)-category|initial]] [[commutative ring spectrum]] ("[[E-∞ ring]]"), just as $\mathbb{Z}$ is the [[initial object|initial]] [[commutative ring]]. The [[formal dual]]  [[Spec(S)]] of $\mathbb{S}$ is hence the [[terminal object in an (infinity,1)-category|terminal]] [[space]] in [[E-∞ arithmetic geometry]] ("[[spectral geometry]]") and [[spectra]] are equivalently the [[quasicoherent ∞-stacks]] over $Spec(\mathbb{S})$

$$
  Spectra \simeq QCoh(Spec(\mathbb{S}))
  \,.
$$

Therefore the study of spectra "[[fracture theorem|fractures]]" into the various [[localizations]] and [[formal completions]] of $Spec(S)$. Since this is like the white light of $Spec(S)$ decomposing into various wavelengths, one speaks of _[[chromatic homotopy theory]]_. 

In particular, an  [[E-∞ ring]] $E$ is [[formal dual|dually]] a morphism of $E_\infty$-algebraic spaces $Spec(E) \longrightarrow Spec(\mathbb{S})$ and under good conditions the [[1-image]] of this map is the formal dual of the [[Bousfield localization of spectra|localization]] $L_E \mathbb{S}$ at $E$:

$$
  Spec(E) \stackrel{epi_1}{\longrightarrow} Spec(L_E \mathbb{S}) \stackrel{mono_1}{\longrightarrow} Spec(\mathbb{S})
 \,.
$$

This means that $Spec(E) \longrightarrow Spec(L_E \mathbb{S})$ is a [[cover]] and that hence $E$-local spectra are equivalently [[quasicoherent ∞-stacks]] on $Spec(E)$ equipped with [[descent data]]: [[formal dual|dually]] they are [[∞-modules]] over $E$ equipped with [[comodule]] structure over the [[Hopf algebroid]] ([[Sweedler coring]]) $E \otimes_{\mathbb{S}} E$.

The computation of [[homotopy groups]] of spectra that make use of their decomposition this way into $E$-[[∞-modules]] equipped with [[descent]] data is the _$E$-[[Adams spectral sequence]]_, a central tool of the theory.

### S) Complex oriented cohomology

For this reason special importance is carried by those [[E-∞ rings]] such that $Spec(E) \to Spec(\mathbb{S})$ is already a [[covering]], for these the $E$-[[∞-modules]] equipped with descent data give an equivalent, but in general more tractable, incarnation of the stable homotopy theory of spectra.

Curiously, this way a good bit of [[differential topology]] -- [[cobordism theory]] -- arises within stable homotopy theory: the archetypical $Spec(E)$ which covers $Spec(\mathbb{S})$ is $E = $ [[MU]], the [[Thom spectrum]] representing [[complex cobordism cohomology]].

An [[commutative ring spectrum]] $E$ over $MU$, hence a $Spec(E)\to Spec(MU)$ is now a [[multiplicative cohomology theory|multiplicative]] "[[complex oriented cohomology theory]]". 


## **Part 1) Stable homotopy theory**

We set up [[stable homotopy theory]].
 
**Literature.** For a decent quick idea see ([Malkiewich 14](#Malkiewich14)).
The original is still good: ([Adams 74, part III sections 2-7](#Adams74)),
except where it considers the [[stable homotopy category]] in its incarnation
as the [[Adams category]], better to consider the [[homotopy category]] of the
[[Bousfield-Friedlander model structure]]. We go through this [below](#Spectra).

### The classical homotopy category

We are interested in the [[stable homotopy category]] of [[spectra]], to which we turn [below](#Spectra). But since its existence is an adjunct of the plain [[homotopy category]] [[Ho(Top)]] of [[homotopy types]] of [[topological spaces]]/[[simplicial sets]], we here review that first.

+-- {: .num_defn #TopologicalSimplex}
###### Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the **[topological n-simplex](simplex#TopologicalSimplex)** is,  up to [[nLab:homeomorphism]], the [[nLab:topological space]] whose underlying set is the subset

$$
  \Delta^n \coloneqq 
  \{
    \vec x \in \mathbb{R}^{n+1}
    |
    \sum_{i = 0 }^n x_i = 1 \; and \;
    \forall i . x_i \geq 0 
  \}
  \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}
$$

of the [[nLab:Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, and whose topology is the  [[nLab:subspace topology]] induces from the canonical topology in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$.

=--

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

For $n = 0$ this is the [[nLab:point]], $\Delta^0 = *$.

For $n = 1$ this is the standard [[nLab:interval object]] $\Delta^1 = [0,1]$.

For $n = 2$ this is the filled triangle.

For $n = 3$ this is the filled tetrahedron.

=--



+-- {: .num_defn #FaceInclusionInBarycentricCoords}
###### Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $\n \geq 1$ and $0 \leq k \leq n$, the 
**$k$th $(n-1)$-face (inclusion)**  of the topological $n$-simplex, def. \ref{TopologicalSimplex}, is the subspace inclusion

$$
  \delta_k : \Delta^{n-1} \hookrightarrow \Delta^n
$$

induced under the coordinate presentation of def. \ref{TopologicalSimplex},
by the inclusion 

$$
  \mathbb{R}^n \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n+1}
$$

which "omits" the $k$th canonical coordinate:

$$
  (x_0, \cdots , x_{n-1}) \mapsto (x_0, \cdots, x_{k-1} , 0 , x_{k}, \cdots, x_n)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

The inclusion 

$$
  \delta_0 : \Delta^0 \to \Delta^1
$$ 

is the inclusion

$$
  \{1\} \hookrightarrow [0,1]
$$ 

of the "right" end of the standard interval. The other inclusion 

$$
  \delta_1 : \Delta^0 \to \Delta^1
$$ 

is that of the "left" end $\{0\} \hookrightarrow [0,1]$.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #DegeneracyProjectionsInBarycentricCoords}
###### Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $0 \leq k \lt n$ the **$k$th degenerate $(n)$-simplex (projection)** is the surjective map

$$
  \sigma_k : \Delta^{n} \to \Delta^{n-1}
$$

induced under the barycentric coordinates of def. \ref{TopologicalSimplex} under the surjection

$$
  \mathbb{R}^{n+1} \to \mathbb{R}^n
$$

which sends

$$
  (x_0, \cdots, x_n) \mapsto (x_0, \cdots, x_{k} + x_{k+1}, \cdots, x_n)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #SingularSimplex}
###### Definition

For $X \in $ [[Top]]  and $n \in \mathbb{N}$, a **singular $n$-simplex** in $X$ is a [[continuous map]]

$$
  \sigma : \Delta^n \to X
$$

from the topological $n$-simplex, def. \ref{TopologicalSimplex}, to $X$.

Write 

$$
  (Sing X)_n \coloneqq Hom_{Top}(\Delta^n , X)
$$ 

for the set of singular $n$-simplices of $X$.

=--

The sets $(Sing X)_\bullet$ here are closely related by an interlocking system of maps that make them form what is called a _[[simplicial set]]_, and as such the collection of these sets of singular simplices is called the _[[singular simplicial complex]]_ of $X$. We discuss the definition of simplicial sets now and then come back to this below in def. \ref{SingularSimplicialComplex}.

Since the topological $n$-simplices $\Delta^n$ from def. \ref{TopologicalSimplex} sit inside each other by the face inclusions of def. \ref{FaceInclusionInBarycentricCoords}

$$
  \delta_k : \Delta^{n-1} \to \Delta^{n}
$$

and project onto each other by the degeneracy maps, def. \ref{DegeneracyProjectionsInBarycentricCoords}

$$
  \sigma_k : \Delta^{n+1} \to \Delta^n
$$

we dually have functions

$$
  d_k \coloneqq Hom_{Top}(\delta_k, X) : (Sing X)_n \to (Sing X)_{n-1}
$$

that send each singular $n$-simplex to its $k$-face and functions

$$
  s_k \coloneqq Hom_{Top}(\sigma_k,X) : (Sing X)_{n} \to (Sing X)_{n+1}
$$

that regard an $n$-simplex as beign a degenerate ("thin") $(n+1)$-simplex.
All these sets of simplices and face and degeneracy maps between them form the following structure. 

+-- {: .num_defn #SimplicialSet}
###### Definition

A **[[nLab:simplicial set]]** $S \in sSet$ is 

* for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ a [[nLab:set]] $S_n \in Set$ -- the **set of $n$-[[simplices]]**;

* for each [[injective map]] $\delta_i : \overline{n-1} \to \overline{n}$ of [[nLab:totally ordered sets]] $\bar n \coloneqq \{ 0 \lt 1 \lt \cdots \lt n \}$

  a [[function]] $d_i : S_{n} \to S_{n-1}$ -- the $i$th **face map** on $n$-simplices;

* for each [[surjective map]] $\sigma_i : \overline{n+1} \to \bar n$ of [[totally ordered sets]]

  a [[function]] $\sigma_i : S_{n} \to S_{n+1}$ -- the $i$th **degeneracy map** on $n$-simplices;

such that these functions satisfy the _[[nLab:simplicial identities]]_.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #SimplicialIdentities}
###### Definition

The **simplicial identities** satisfied by face and degeneracy maps as above are (whenever these maps are composable as indicated):

1. $ d_i \circ d_j  = d_{j-1} \circ d_i$ if $i \lt j$,

1. $s_i \circ s_j  = s_j \circ s_{i-1}$ if $i \gt j$.

1. $d_i \circ s_j =  \left\{ \array{ s_{j-1} \circ d_i &  if \;  i \lt j \\ id & if  \;  i = j \; or \; i = j+1 \\ s_j \circ d_{i-1} &  if i \gt j+1 } \right. $

=--

It is straightforward to check by explicit inspection that the evident injection and restriction maps between the sets of [[singular simplices]] make $(Sing X)_\bullet$ into a simplicial set. However for working with this, it is good to streamline a little:

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

The **[[simplex category]]** $\Delta$ is the [[full subcategory]] of [[Cat]] on the free categories of the form

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    [0] & \coloneqq \{0\}
    \\
    [1] & \coloneqq \{0 \to 1\}
    \\
   [2] & \coloneqq \{0 \to 1 \to 2\}
   \\
   \vdots
   \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

This is called the "simplex category" because we are to think of the object $[n]$ as being the "[[spine]]" of the $n$-[[nLab:simplex]]. For instance for $n = 2$ we think of $0 \to 1 \to 2$ as the "spine" of the triangle. This becomes clear if we don't just draw the morphisms that _generate_ the category $[n]$, but draw also all their composites. For instance for $n = 2$ we have_

$$
  [2]  
  = 
  \left\{
  \array{
     && 1
     \\
     & \nearrow && \searrow
     \\
    0 &&\to&& 2
  }
  \right\}
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

A [[functor]] 

$$
  S : \Delta^{op} \to Set
$$

from the [[nLab:opposite category]] of the [[nLab:simplex category]] to the category [[nLab:Set]] of sets is canonically identified with a [[nLab:simplicial set]], def. \ref{SimplicialSet}.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

One checks by inspection that the simplicial identities 
characterize precisely the behaviour of the morphisms in
$\Delta^{op}([n],[n+1])$ and $\Delta^{op}([n],[n-1])$.

=--

This makes the following evident:

+-- {: .num_example #StandardCosimplicialTopologicalSpace}
###### Example

The [[topological simplices]] from def. \ref{TopologicalSimplex} arrange into a _[[cosimplicial object]] in [[Top]]_, namely a [[functor]]

$$
  \Delta^\bullet : \Delta \to Top
  \,.
$$

=--

With this now the structure of a simplicial set on $(Sing X)_\bullet$, def. \ref{SingularSimplex}, is manifest: it is just the _[[nerve]]_ of $X$ with respect to $\Delta^\bullet$, namely:

+-- {: .num_defn #SingularSimplicialComplex}
###### Definition

For $X$ a [[topological space]] its **[[singular simplicial complex|simplicial set of singular simplicies]]**  (often called the **[[singular simplicial complex]]**)

$$
  (Sing X)_\bullet : \Delta^{op} \to Set
$$

is given by composition of the functor from example \ref{StandardCosimplicialTopologicalSpace} with the [[nLab:hom functor]] of [[nLab:Top]]:

$$
  (Sing X) : [n] \mapsto Hom_{Top}( \Delta^n , X )
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark 

It turns out -- this is the content of the _[[nLab:homotopy hypothesis]]-theorem_ ([Quillen 67](model+structure+on+simplicial+sets#Quillen67)) -- that [[homotopy type]] of the topological space $X$ is entirely captured by its singular simplicial complex $Sing X$. Moreover, the [[geometric realization]] of $Sing X$ is a model for the same [[homotopy type]] as that of $X$, but with the special property that it is canonically a [[cell complex]] -- a [[CW-complex]]. Better yet, $Sing X$ is itself already good cell complex, namely a [[Kan complex]].

=--


+-- {: .num_defn #Horn}
###### Definition

For each $i$, $0 \leq i \leq n$, the **$(n,i)$-horn** 
is the subsimplicial set 

$$
  \Lambda^i[n]
  \hookrightarrow
  \Delta[n] 
$$

of the simplicial $n$-[[simplex]], which is the [[union]] of all faces _except_ the  $i^{th}$ one.

This is called an **outer horn** if $k = 0$ or $k = n$.  Otherwise it is an **inner horn**.


=--

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark


Since [[sSet]]  is a [[presheaf category]], [[unions]] of [[subobjects]] make sense and they are calculated objectwise, thus in this case dimensionwise.  This way it becomes clear what the structure of a horn as a functor $\Lambda^k[n]: \Delta^{op} \to Set$ must therefore be: it takes $[m]$ to the collection of ordinal maps $f: [m] \to [n]$ which do not have the element $k$ in the image.

=--


+-- {: .num_defn #KanComplexes}
###### Definition

A _[[Kan complex]]_ is a [[simplicial set]] $S$ that satisfies the _Kan condition_, 

* which says that all [[horns]] of the simplicial set have _fillers_/extend to [[simplices]];

* which means equivalently that the unique homomorphism $S \to pt$ from $S$ to the [[point]] (the [[terminal object|terminal]] [[simplicial set]]) is a [[Kan fibration]];

* which means equivalently that for all [[diagrams]] of the form

  $$
  \array{
    \Lambda^i[n] &\to& S
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \Delta[n] &\to& pt
  }
  \;\;\;
  \leftrightarrow
  \;\;\;
  \array{
    \Lambda^i[n] &\to& S
    \\
    \downarrow && 
    \\
    \Delta[n] 
  }
  $$

  there exists a diagonal morphism

  $$
  \array{
    \Lambda^i[n] &\to& S
    \\
    \downarrow &\nearrow& \downarrow
    \\
    \Delta[n] &\to& pt
  }
  \;\;\;
  \leftrightarrow
  \;\;\;
  \array{
    \Lambda^i[n] &\to& S
    \\
    \downarrow &\nearrow& 
    \\
    \Delta[n] 
  }
  $$

  completing this to a [[commuting diagram]];

* which in turn means equivalently that the map from $n$-simplices to $(n,i)$-horns is an [[epimorphism]]
$$
  [\Delta[n], S]\, \twoheadrightarrow \,[\Lambda^i[n],S]
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

For $X$ a [[topological space]], its [[singular simplicial complex]]
$Sing(X)$, def. \ref{SingularSimplicialComplex}, is a Kan complex, def. \ref{KanComplexes}.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The inclusions ${{\Lambda^n}_{Top}}_k \hookrightarrow \Delta^n_{Top}$ of topological horns into topological simplices are  [[retracts]], in that there are [[continuous maps]] $\Delta^n_{Top} \to {{\Lambda^n}_{Top}}_k$ given by "squashing" a topological $n$-simplex onto parts of its boundary, such that

$$
  ({{\Lambda^n}_{Top}}_k \to \Delta^n_{Top} \to
  {{\Lambda^n}_{Top}}_k)
  =
  Id
  \,.
$$

Therefore the map
$[\Delta^n, \Pi(X)] \to [\Lambda^n_k,\Pi(X)]$ is an epimorphism, since it is equal to  to $Top(\Delta^n, X) \to Top(\Lambda^n_k, X)$ which has a right inverse $Top(\Lambda^n_k, X) \to Top(\Delta^n, X)$.

With this we finally arrive at a presentation of the classical homotopy category. For our purposes the following may be taken to be a definition, otherwise it is part of the theorem of ([Quillen 67](model+structure+on+simplicial+sets#Quillen67)), known sometimes as the _[homotopy hypothesis for Kan complexes](homotopy hypothesis#ForKanComplexes)_.

### The stable homotopy category
 {#Spectra}

We construct the [[stable homotopy category]].

The stable homotopy category is to be the [[stabilization]] of the classical [[homotopy category]] [[Ho(Top)]] $\simeq$ [[Ho(sSet)]] under the operation of forming [[loop space objects]] $\Omega$ and [[reduced suspensions]] $\Sigma$: via forming [[suspension spectra]] $\Sigma^\infty$ every [[pointed object]] in the classical [[homotopy category]] maps to the stable homotopy category, and under this map the [[loop space]]- and [[reduced suspension]]-[[functors]] become inverse [[equivalence of categories|equivalences]] on the stable homotopy category.

$$
  \array{
     Ho(Top)^{\ast/} 
      &
      \underoverset{\underset{\Omega}{\longrightarrow}}{\overset{\Sigma}{\longleftarrow}}{} 
      &
     Ho(Top)^{\ast/}
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\Sigma^\infty}}\downarrow \dashv \uparrow^{\mathrlap{\Omega^\infty}}
     &&
     {}^{\mathllap{\Sigma^\infty}}\downarrow \dashv \uparrow^{\mathrlap{\Omega^\infty}}
     \\
     Ho(Spectra) 
     &
     \underoverset{\underset{\Omega}{\longrightarrow}}{\overset{\Sigma}{\longleftarrow}}{\simeq}
     &
     Ho(Spectra)
  }
  \,.
$$


In contrast to the classical [[homotopy category]], the stable homotopy category is a [[triangulated category]] (a shadow of the fact that the [[(∞,1)-category of spectra]] is a [[stable (∞,1)-category]]). As such it may be thought of as a refinement of the [[derived category]] [[category of chain complexes|of chain complexes]] (of [[abelian groups]]): every [[chain complex]] gives rise to a [[spectrum]] and every [[chain map]] to a map between these spectra (the [[stable Dold-Kan correspondence]]), but there are many more spectra and maps between them than arise from chain complexes and chain maps.

###### Definition

Let $E \in Spec$ be a [[spectrum]]. 

Say that another spectrum $X \in Spec$ is an **$E$-acyclic spectrum** if the [[smash product of spectra|smash product]] is [[zero object|zero]], $E \wedge X \simeq 0$.

Say that $X$ is an **$E$-local spectrum** if every [[morphism]]
$Y \longrightarrow X$ out of an $E$-acyclic spectrum $Y$ is homotopic to the [[zero morphism]]. 

Say that a morphism $f \colon X \to Y$ is an **$E$-equivalence** if it becomes an [[equivalence]] after [[smash product]] with $E$.

###### Proposition

For $E$ a [[spectrum]], every spectrum sits in an essentially unique [[homotopy cofiber sequence]]

$$
  G_E(X) \to X \to L_E(X)
  \,,
$$

where $G_E(X)$ is $E$-acyclic, and $L_E(X)$ is $E$-local, def. \ref{AcyclicAndLocal}.

Here $X \to L_E (X)$ is characterized by two properties

1. $L_E(X)$ is $E$-local;

1. $X \to L_E(X)$ is an $E$-equivalence

according to def. \ref{AcyclicAndLocal}.

###### Definition

Given $E \in Spec$, 
the [[natural transformation|natural morphisms]] $X \longrightarrow L_E X$
in prop. \ref{LocalizationCofiber} exhibit the [[localization of an (infinity,1)-category]] called **Bousfield localization** at $E$.

###### Remark

There is a canonical map

$$
  L_E X \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow} \underset{\leftarrow}{\lim}_n (E^{\wedge^{n+1}_S}\wedge_S X)
$$

from the $E$-[[Bousfield localization of spectra]] of $X$ into the [[totalization]].

We consider now conditions for this morphism to be an [[equivalence]].

For $R$ a [[ring]], its _core_ $c R$ is the [[equalizer]] in

  R 
    \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow}
  R \otimes R

###### Proposition

Let $E$ be a [[connective spectrum|connective]] [[E-∞ ring]] such that the core of $\pi_0(E)$, def. \ref{CoreOfARing}, is either of

* the [[localization of a ring|localization]] of the [[integers]] at a set $J$ of [[primes]], $c \pi_0(E) \simeq \mathbb{Z}[J^{-1}]$;

* $\mathbb{Z}_n$ for $n \geq 2$.

Then the map in remark \ref{CanonicalMapFromELocalizationToTotalization} is an equivalence

###### Proposition
**(Sullivan arithmetic square)**

For every [[spectrum]] $X$ the canonical square

$$
  \array{
    && L_{\mathbb{Q}}X
    \\
    & \swarrow && \nwarrow
    \\
    L_{\mathbb{Q}}

    \right)

    X
    \\
     & \nwarrow && \swarrow
    \\
    && \prod_p L_p X

$$

is a [[homotopy pushout]] (hence also a [[homotopy pullback]]).

=--

Original statements of this include ([Bousfield 79](#Bousfield79), [Sullivan 05, prop. 3.20](#Sullivan05)). Review includes ([van Koughnett 13, prop. 4.5](#VanKoughnett13), [Bauer 11, lemma 2.1](#Bauer11)). 


So the [[nLab:arithmetic fracture square]] from [[nLab:Weil uniformization theorem|Weil uniformization]] over [[nLab:Spec(S)]] synthesizes spectra from their formal completion and torsion approximation:


$$
  \array{
    &&  {{localization} \atop {away\;from\;p}} && \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow} && {{p-adic} \atop {residual}}

    \\
    && { {formal\;completion} \atop {at\;p} }
    \; && \longrightarrow && {{p-torsion} \atop {approximation}}

$$

(and there is further fracturing of the $p$-local part by [[nLab:chromatic homotopy theory]]).

+-- {: .num_prop #ReformulationOfProdOverPComletionByLocalizationAtCoproduct}
###### Proposition

The product of all [[p-completions]] is equivalently the [[Bousfield localization of spectra]] at the [[wedge sum]] $\vee_p S \mathbb{F}_p$ of all [[Moore spectra]]


$$
  \prod_p L_p X
  \simeq
   L_{\vee_p S \mathbb{F}_p} X
  \,.
$$

Moreover there is a  [[Bousfield equivalence]] 

$$
  S (\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}) \simeq_{Bousf} \vee_p S \mathbb{F}_p
  \,,
$$ 

and therefore also an equivalence

$$
  \prod_p L_p X
  \simeq
   L_{S (\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z})} X
  \,.
$$


=--

The first statement originates around ([Bousfield 79, prop. 2.6](Bousfield+localization+of+spectra#Bousfield79)), review includes ([van Koughnett 13, prop. 4.4](Bousfield+localization+of+spectra#VanKoughnett13), [Bauer 11, below prop. 2.2](#Bauer11)); the second is highlighted in ([Strickland 12, MO comment](http://mathoverflow.net/a/91057/381)).


By prop. \ref{ReformulationOfProdOverPComletionByLocalizationAtCoproduct}
the arithmetic fracture square of prop. \ref{SullivanArithmeticFracture} is equivalently of the form

$$
  \array{

    && L_{H\mathbb{Q}}X
    \\
    & \swarrow && \nwarrow
    \\
    L_{H\mathbb{Q}}
    L_{S \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}} X
    &&  &&
    X
    \\
     & \nwarrow && \swarrow
    \\
    && L_{S \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}} X
  }
  \,.
$$

In this form the statement holds much more generally:

+-- {: .num_prop #GeneralFractureSquare}
###### Proposition

Let $E, F, X$ be [[spectra]] such that the $F$-[[Bousfield localization of spectra|localization]] of $X$ is $E$-acyclic, i.e.  $E_\bullet(L_F X) \simeq 0$, then the canonical square [[diagram]]


$$

    L_{E\vee F} X
    \\
     & \nwarrow && \swarrow
    \\
    && L_E X

$$

is a [[homotopy pullback]] (and hence by stability also a [[homotopy pushout]]).

## **Interlude) Spectral sequences**
 {#SpectralSequences}

In the end, what one wants to compute in stable homotopy 
theory are [[stable homotopy groups]] of [[spectra]] that are built
from other spaces and spectra in some way. Notably one wants to 
know the homotopy groups of [[mapping spectra]] $[X,E]$ ([[generalized cohomology|generalized]] [[cohomology groups]])
and of [[smash products of spectra]] $E \wedge X$ ([[generalized homology|generalized]] [[homology groups]]).

In general the only practicable way to carry out such computations is by doing them along a decomposition of the given spectrum into a "sequence of stages" of sorts. The concept of _[[spectral sequence]]_ is what formalizes this idea.

(Here the re-occurence of the root "spectr-" it is a historical coincidence, but a lucky one.)

###### Definition

A [[filtered object in an (∞,1)-category|filtering]] on a [[spectrum]] $X$ is a sequence of spectra of the form

$$

  X_3
    \stackrel{f_2}{\longrightarrow}

###### Remark

Given a filtered spectrum as in def. \ref{FilteredSpectrum},

$$
  \array{

   X

each stage

$$
 \array{
   X_{k+1} &\stackrel{f_k}{\longrightarrow}& X_k   
   \\
   && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{cofib(f_k)}}
   \\
   && A_k
 }
$$

is a [[homotopy fiber sequence]].

Applying the [[stable homotopy groups]]-[[functor]] to this yields a diagram of [[graded abelian groups]] of the form

$$
  \array{
   \cdots 
     &\stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}& 
   \pi_\bullet(X_3) 
     &\stackrel{\pi_\bullet(f_2)}{\longrightarrow}&

   && \pi_\bullet(A_3) && \pi_\bullet(A_2) && \pi_\bullet(A_1) && \pi_\bullet(A_0)

$$

Here each hook at stage $k$ extends to a [[long exact sequence of homotopy groups]]

$$

  \pi_\bullet(A_k)
   \stackrel{\delta_k}{\longrightarrow}
  \pi_{\bullet-1}(X_{k+1})
  \to 
  \cdots
  \,.
$$

If we understand the [[connecting homomorphism]]

$$
  \delta_k \colon \pi_\bullet(A_k) \longrightarrow \pi_\bullet(X_{k+1})
$$

as a morphism of degree -1, then all this information fits into one diagram of the form

$$

   \cdots 
     &\stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}& 
   \pi_\bullet(X_3) 
     &\stackrel{\pi_\bullet(f_2)}{\longrightarrow}& 
   \pi_\bullet(X_2) 
     &\stackrel{\pi_\bullet(f_2)}{\longrightarrow} & 
   \pi_\bullet(X_1) 
     &\stackrel{\pi_\bullet(f_1)}{\longrightarrow}& 
   \pi_\bullet(X_0)

   \downarrow &{}_{\mathllap{\delta_1}}\nwarrow &
   \downarrow &{}_{\mathllap{\delta_0}}\nwarrow

   \\
   && \pi_\bullet(A_3) && \pi_\bullet(A_2) && \pi_\bullet(A_1) && \pi_\bullet(A_0)
  }
  \,,
$$

where each triangle is a rolled-up incarnation of a [[long exact sequence of homotopy groups]] (and in particular is _not_ a commuting diagram!).

If we furthermore consider the [[bigraded object|bigraded]] [[abelian groups]] $\pi_\bullet(X_\bullet)$ and $\pi_\bullet(A_\bullet)$, then this information may further be rolled-up to a single diagram of the form

$$
  \array{
     \pi_\bullet(X_\bullet)
       & \stackrel{\pi_\bullet(f_\bullet)}{\longrightarrow} &
     \pi_\bullet(X_\bullet)

       & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\pi_\bullet(cofib(f_\bullet))}}
     \\
     && 
     \pi_\bullet(A_\bullet)
  }
$$

where the morphisms $\pi_\bullet(f_\bullet)$, $\pi_\bullet(cofib(f_\bullet))$ and $\delta$ have bi-degree $(0,-1)$, $(0,0)$ and $(-1,1)$, respectively.

Here it is convenient to shift the bigrading, equivalently, by setting

$$
  \mathcal{D}^{s,t} \coloneqq \pi_{t-s}(X_s)
$$

$$
  \mathcal{E}^{s,t} \coloneqq \pi_{t-s}(A_s)
  \,,
$$

because then $t$ counts the cycles of going around the triangles:

$$
  \cdots
   \to 
  \mathcal{D}^{s+1,t+1}
    \stackrel{\pi_{t-s}(f_s)}{\longrightarrow}
  \mathcal{D}^{s,t}

  \mathcal{E}^{s,t}
    \stackrel{\delta_s}{\longrightarrow}
  \mathcal{D}^{s+1,t}

      is (long) exact;


1. a morphism $A \longrightarrow B$  is 

   1. a _monomorphism_ if $0 \longrightarrow A \longrightarrow B$ is an exact sequence;

   1. an _epimorphism_ if $A \longrightarrow B \longrightarrow 0$ is an exact sequence.

For $E$ a [[ring spectrum]], then a sequence of spectra is (long/short) _$E$-exact_ and a morphism is epi/mono, respectively, if becomes long/short exact or epi/mono, respectively, after taking [[smash product of spectra|smash product]] with $E$.

**Abstract.** _The [[(infinity,1)-category|category]] of [[generalized cohomology theories]] equipped with a universal "[[complex oriented cohomology theory|complex]] [[orientation in generalized cohomology|orientation]]" happens to unify within it the abstract structure theory of [[stable homotopy theory]] with the concrete richness of the [[differential topology]] of [[cobordism theory]] and of the [[arithmetic geometry]] of [[formal group laws]] (of [[higher Jacobians]]), such as [[elliptic curves]]. In the seminar we work through classical results in [[algebraic topology]], organized such as to give in the end a first glimpse of the modern picture of [[chromatic homotopy theory]]._


### **Part S1) Generalized cohomology**

For instance ([Aguilar-Gitler-Prieto 02, chapters 7,8 and 12](#AguilarGitlerPrieto02)) and ([Malkiewich 11](#Malkiewich11)).

#### Generalized homology and cohomology functors
 {#GeneralizedHomologyAndCohomologyFunctors}

The concept that makes [[algebraic topology]] be about methods of [[homological algebra]] applied to [[topology]] is that of [[generalized homology]] [[generalized cohomology]]: [[covariant functors]] or [[contravariant functors]]

$$
  Top \longrightarrow Ab^{\mathbb{Z}}
$$

from (suitably nice) [[topological spaces]], such that some key properties of the [[homotopy types]] of topological spaces is preserved as one passes them to the more tractable [[category]] [[Ab]]${}^{\mathbb{Z}}$  of $\mathbb{Z}$-[[graded abelian groups]].

A [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] theory is such a contravariant functor which satisfies the key properties exhibited by [[ordinary cohomology]] (as computed for instance by [[singular cohomology]]), _except_ that its value on the point is not required to be concentrated in degree 0.

An important example of a generalised cohomology theory other than ordinary cohomology is [[topological K-theory]].


#### Brown representability theorem


(-- from here on we need the basics of [Part 1), Spectra](#Spectra) --)

Given any functor such as the generalized (co)homology functor [above](GeneralizedHomologyAndCohomologyFunctors), an important question to ask is whether it is a _[[representable functor]]_. Due to the $\mathbb{Z}$-grading and the [[suspension isomorphisms]], if a generalized (co)homology functor is representable at all, it must be represented by a $\mathbb{Z}$-indexed sequence of [[pointed topological spaces]] such that the [[reduced suspension]] of one is comparable to the next one in the list, hence it must be represented by a _[[spectrum]]_.

Whitehead observed that indeed every [[spectrum]] represents a generalized (co)homology theory.  The _[[Brown representability theorem]]_ states that, conversely, every generalized (co)homology theory is represented by a spectrum.

Due to [[phantom maps]], there remains a subtle difference between generalized (co)homology functors and the spectra which represent them: a little bit of information is lost as one passes from the spectrum to its cohomology functor (the [[Yoneda lemma]] does not quite apply here, since a spectrum is more than just one (homotopy type of a) topological space).

In applications and modern theory, it is mostly the spectra that matter, and hence the Brown representability theory is used to transfer extra structure on spectra to extra structure on cohomology theories.

For instance a _[[multiplicative cohomology theory]]_ is one which is represented by a [[ring spectrum]].

#### Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence

(-- from here on we need the basics of [Interlude: Spectral sequences](#SpectralSequences) --)

Given a [[generalized cohomology theory]] $E$, there is a [[spectral sequence]] known as the _[[Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence]]_ which serves to compute $E$-cohomology of any space $X$ in terms of [[ordinary cohomology]] with [[coefficients]] in $E_\bullet(\ast)$.

### **Part S2) Cobordism theory**

For instance ([Malkiewich 11](#Malkiewich11)).

As one passes from [[abelian groups]] to [[spectra]], a miracle happens: even though the latter are just the proper embodiment of [[linear algebra]] in the context of [[homotopy theory]] ("[[higher algebra]]") their inspection reveals that spectra natively know about deep phenomena of [[differential topology]], [[index theory]] and in fact [[string theory]] (for instance via a close relation between _[[genera and partition functions - table|genera and partition functions]]_). 

The strongest manifestation of this comes about in [[complex oriented cohomology theory]]/[[chromatic homotopy theory]] that we eventually come to [below](#ComplexOrientedCohomologyTheory), which higher linear algebra over the complex Thom spectrum [[MU]]. 

Here we first concentrate on its real avatar, the [[Thom spectrum]] [[MO]]. The seminal result of [[Thom's theorem]] says that the [[homotopy groups of a spectrum|homotopy groups]] of [[MO]] form the [[cobordism ring]] of [[cobordism]]-[[equivalence classes]] of [[manifolds]]. In the course of discussing this _[[cobordism theory]]_ one encounters various phenomena whose complex version also governs the complex oriented cohomology theory that we are interested in [below](#ComplexOrientedCohomologyTheory).



#### Thom spectra

* [[Thom spectrum]], [[MO]]

  [[Thom space]]

  [[Pontrjagin-Thom collapse map]]

#### Thom's theorem

* [[Thom isomorphism]] (in [[ordinary cohomology]])

  [[cup product]] 

  [[Leray-Hirsch theorem]]

  [[Thom class]]

  [[fiber integration]]


#### Orientation and Fiber integration
 {#OrientationAndFiberIntegration}


From the way the [[Thom isomorphism]] via a [[Thom class]] works in [[ordinary cohomology]] (as [above](#ThomIsomorphism)), one sees what the general concept of [[orientation in generalized cohomology]] ought to be.

use ([Adams 74, part III, section 10](#Adams74) [Lurie 10, lecture 5](#Lurie10))

[[orientation in generalized cohomology]]

* [[fiber integration in generalized cohomology]]


### **Part S3) Complex oriented cohomology**
 {#ComplexOrientedCohomologyTheory}

Use ([Adams 74, Part I, Part II](#Adams74), [Lurie 10, lectures 1-16](#Lurie10)).


#### Complex oriented cohomology

(-- from here on we need the basics of [Part 1), Ring spectra](#RingSpectra) --)

Given the concept of [[orientation in generalized cohomology]] as [above](#OrientationAndFiberIntegration), it is clearly of interest to consider [[cohomology theories]] $E$ such that there exists an orientation/[[Thom class]] on the [[associated bundle|associated]] [[vector bundle]] over any [[classifying space]] $B G$ (or rather: on its induced [[spherical fibration]]), for then _all_ $G$-associated vector bundles inherit an orientation.

Considering this for $G = U(n)$ the [[unitary groups]], for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, with their defining $\mathbb{C}$-[[linear representations]] on $\mathbb{C}^n \simeq_{\mathbb{R}} \mathbb{R}^2 n$ yields the concept of _[[complex oriented cohomology theory]]_. 

It turns out that a complex orientation on a generalized cohomology theory $E$ in this sense is already given by demanding that there is a suitable generalization of the [[first Chern class]] of [[complex line bundles]] in $E$-cohomology. This already implies the existence of [[generalized Chern classes]] of all degrees $2n$, and these are the required universal generalized [[Thom classes]] ([Lurie 10, lecture 5, prop. 6](#Lurie10)).

Where the ordinary [[first Chern class]] in [[ordinary cohomology]] is simply additive under [[tensor product]] of [[complex line bundles]], one finds that the composite of generalized first Chern classes is instead governed by more general commutative [[formal group laws]]. This phenomenon governs much of the theory to follow.

### Basic

For section **1) Stable homotopy theory** we follow the modern picture of the stable homotopy category in the style of the exposition

* {#Malkiewich14} [[Cary Malkiewich]], _The stable homotopy category_, 2014 ([pdf](http://math.uiuc.edu/~cmalkiew/stable.pdf)).

but we'll also take some clues from the [[Bousfield-Friedlander model structure]] (without introducing [[model category]] theory in full beauty).

For more details, the classical account in ([Adams 74, part III sections 2, 4-7](#Adams74)) is still a good read (but ignore the "[[Adams category]]"-construction of the stable homotopy category in sections III.2 and III.3).

For **Interlude: Spectral sequences** a discussion streamlined for our puroses is in ([Rognes 12, section 2](#Rognes12)).

For **2) Adams spectral sequence** we follow ([Hopkins 99, section 5](#Hopkins99)) as worked out in

* {#Aramian} [[Nersés Aramian]], _The Adams spectral sequence_ ([[AramianANSS.pdf:file]])


For **S1) Generalized cohomology** a neat account is in:

* {#AguilarGitlerPrieto02} Marcelo Aguilar, [[Samuel Gitler]], Carlos Prieto, section 12 of _Algebraic topology from a homotopical viewpoint_, Springer (2002) ([toc pdf](http://tocs.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/106999419.pdf))


For **S2) Cobordism theory** an efficient collection of the highlights is in

* {#Malkiewich11} [[Cary Malkiewich]], _Unoriented cobordism and $M O$_, 2011 ([pdf](http://math.uiuc.edu/~cmalkiew/cobordism.pdf))

except that it omits proof of the [[Leray-Hirsch theorem]] and that of the [[Thom isomorphism]], but see the references there.
 
For **S3) Complex oriented cohomology** we follow part II of 

* {#Adams74} [[Frank Adams]], _[[Stable homotopy and generalized homology]]_, Chicago Lectures in mathematics, 1974

and

* {#Lurie10} [[Jacob Lurie]], lectures 1-16 of _[[Chromatic Homotopy Theory]]_, 2010

(These overlap, pick the one that seems more inviting on first reading.)
