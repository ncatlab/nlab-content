## Survey
 {#Introduction}

We are concerned with the theory of _[[spectra]]_ in the sense of [[algebraic topology]]: the proper generalization of [[abelian groups]] to [[homotopy theory]]. 

### 1) Stable homotopy theory
 {#StableHomotopyTheory}

A [[group]] in homotopy theory is equivalently a [[loop space]] under concatenation of loops ("[[∞-group]]"). A double loop space is a group with some commutativity structure ("[[Eckmann-Hilton argument]]"), a triple loop space has more commutativity structure, and so forth. A _spectrum_ is where this progression of [[looping and delooping]] _stabilizes_ (an "$\infty$-abelian group"). Therefore one speaks of _[[stable homotopy theory]]_:

$$
  Spaces
  \;\;
  \underoverset{(linearization)}{stabilization}{\mapsto}
  \;\;
  Spectra
  \,.
$$

Most of [[linear algebra]] and [[algebraic geometry]] passes along as [[abelian groups]] are generalized to [[spectra]] and turns into something remarkably rich, called _[[brave new algebra]]_, _[[higher algebra]]_ and _[[E-∞ geometry|spectral geometry]]_. In particular the analog of the theory of ([[commutative ring|commutative]]) [[rings]] and their [[modules]] exist, given by ([[commutative ring spectrum|commutative]]) [[ring spectra]] ([[E-∞ rings]], [[A-∞ rings]]) and [[module spectra]] ([[∞-modules]]). 

### 2) Adams spectral sequences
 {#ANSS}

Since spectra are considerably richer than abelian groups, stable homotopy is much concerned with "[[fracture theorem|fracturing]]" stable homotopy types into more tractable components:

To that end, notice that from the point of view of [[arithmetic geometry]], an [[abelian group]] $A$ is equivalently a [[quasicoherent sheaf]] over [[Spec(Z)]]. 

$$
  AbelianGroups \simeq QCoh(Spec(\mathbb{Z}))
  \,.
$$

This point of view generalizes to homotopy theory and turns out to be very fruitful there. The analog of the [[integers]] $\mathbb{Z}$ is the [[sphere spectrum]] $\mathbb{S}$, and this is naturally the [[initial object in an (infinity,1)-category|initial]] [[commutative ring spectrum]] ("[[E-∞ ring]]"), just as $\mathbb{Z}$ is the [[initial object|initial]] [[commutative ring]]. The [[formal dual]]  [[Spec(S)]] of $\mathbb{S}$ is hence the [[terminal object in an (infinity,1)-category|terminal]] [[space]] in [[E-∞ arithmetic geometry]] ("[[spectral geometry]]") and [[spectra]] are equivalently the [[quasicoherent ∞-stacks]] over $Spec(\mathbb{S})$

$$
  Spectra \simeq QCoh(Spec(\mathbb{S}))
  \,.
$$

Therefore the study of spectra "[[fracture theorem|fractures]]" into the various [[localizations]] and [[formal completions]] of $Spec(S)$. Since this is like the white light of $Spec(S)$ decomposing into various wavelengths, one speaks of _[[chromatic homotopy theory]]_. 

In particular, an  [[E-∞ ring]] $E$ is [[formal dual|dually]] a morphism of $E_\infty$-algebraic spaces $Spec(E) \longrightarrow Spec(\mathbb{S})$ and under good conditions the [[1-image]] of this map is the formal dual of the [[Bousfield localization of spectra|localization]] $L_E \mathbb{S}$ at $E$:

$$
  Spec(E) \stackrel{epi_1}{\longrightarrow} Spec(L_E \mathbb{S}) \stackrel{mono_1}{\longrightarrow} Spec(\mathbb{S})
 \,.
$$

This means that $Spec(E) \longrightarrow Spec(L_E \mathbb{S})$ is a [[cover]] and that hence $E$-local spectra are equivalently [[quasicoherent ∞-stacks]] on $Spec(E)$ equipped with [[descent data]]: [[formal dual|dually]] they are [[∞-modules]] over $E$ equipped with [[comodule]] structure over the [[Hopf algebroid]] ([[Sweedler coring]]) $E \otimes_{\mathbb{S}} E$.

The computation of [[homotopy groups]] of spectra that make use of their decomposition this way into $E$-[[∞-modules]] equipped with [[descent]] data is the _$E$-[[Adams spectral sequence]]_, a central tool of the theory.

### S) Complex oriented cohomology

For this reason special importance is carried by those [[E-∞ rings]] such that $Spec(E) \to Spec(\mathbb{S})$ is already a [[covering]], for these the $E$-[[∞-modules]] equipped with descent data give an equivalent, but in general more tractable, incarnation of the stable homotopy theory of spectra.

Curiously, this way a good bit of [[differential topology]] -- [[cobordism theory]] -- arises within stable homotopy theory: the archetypical $Spec(E)$ which covers $Spec(\mathbb{S})$ is $E = $ [[MU]], the [[Thom spectrum]] representing [[complex cobordism cohomology]].

An [[commutative ring spectrum]] $E$ over $MU$, hence a $Spec(E)\to Spec(MU)$ is now a [[multiplicative cohomology theory|multiplicative]] "[[complex oriented cohomology theory]]".

## **Prelude) Classical homotopy theory**
 {#ClassicalHomotopyTheory}


We are interested in the [[stable homotopy category]] of [[spectra]], to which we turn [below](#Spectra). But since its existence is an adjunct of the plain [[homotopy category]] [[Ho(Top)]] of [[homotopy types]] of [[topological spaces]]/[[simplicial sets]], we here review that first.

### **P.1)** Topological homotopy theory
 {#TheClassicalHomotopyCategory}


While the field of [[algebraic topology]] clearly originates in [[topology]], it is not actually interested in [[topological spaces]] regarded up to topological [[isomorphism]], namely [[homeomorphism]], but only in topological spaces regarded up to [[weak homotopy equivalence]] -- hence it is interested only in the "weak [[homotopy types]]" of topological spaces. This is so notably because [[ordinary cohomology]] [[cohomology group|groups]] are [[invariants]] of the (weak) [[homotopy type]] of topological spaces but do not detect their [[homeomorphism]] class. 

The [[category]] of topological spaces obtained by [[localization of a category|forcing]] [[weak homotopy equivalences]] to become [[isomorphisms]] is the "classical [[homotopy category]]" [[Ho(Top)]]. This homotopy category however has forgotten a little too much information: homotopy theory really wants the [[weak homotopy equivalences]] not to become plain [[isomorphisms]], but to become actual [[homotopy equivalences]]. The structure that reflects this is called a _[[model category]]_ structure (short for "category of models for [[homotopy types]]"). For classical homotopy theory this is accordingly called the _[[classical model structure on topological spaces]]_. This we review here.

**Literature** ([Hirschhorn 15](#Hirschhorn15))

#### Background from algebraic topology
 {#BackgroundOnTopologicalHomotopyTheoryFromAlgebraicTopology}

This section recalls basic relevant concepts from [[algebraic topology]] and highlights some basic facts that may serve to motivate the Quillen model structure.

##### Homotopy

The fundamental concept of [[homotopy theory]] is that of _[[homotopy]]_. In the context of [[topological spaces]] this is about [[continuous function|contiunous]] deformations of [[continuous functions]] parameterized by the standard interval:

+-- {: .num_defn #TopologicalInterval}
###### Definition

Write 

$$
  I \coloneqq [0,1] \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$

for the standard topological [[interval]], a [[compact topological space|compact]] [[connected topological space|connected]] [[topological subspace]] of the [[real line]].

Equipped with the canonical inclusion of its two endpoints

$$
  \ast \sqcup \ast \stackrel{(\delta_0,\delta_1)}{\longrightarrow} I \stackrel{\exists !}{\longrightarrow} \ast
$$

this is the standard [[interval object]] in [[Top]].

For $X \in Top$, the [[product topological space]] $X\times I$
is called the standard _[[cylinder object]]_ over $X$.
The endpoint inclusions of the interval make it factor the [[codiagonal]] on $X$

$$
  \nabla_X 
    \;\colon\; 
  X \sqcup X
  \stackrel{((id,\delta_0),(id,\delta_1))}{\longrightarrow}
  X \times I
  \longrightarrow
  X
  \,.
$$

=--



+-- {: .num_defn #LeftHomotopy}
###### Definition

For $f,g\colon X \longrightarrow Y$ two [[continuous functions]] between [[topological spaces]] $X,Y$, then a **[[left homotopy]]** $f \Rightarrow_L g$ is a [[continuous function]]

$$
  \eta \;\colon\; X \times I \longrightarrow Y
$$

out of the [[product topological space]] of $X$ with the standard interval of def. \ref{TopologicalInterval}, such that this fits into a [[commuting diagram]] of the form

$$
  \array{
     X 
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{(id,\delta_0)}}\downarrow & \searrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
     \\
     X \times I &\stackrel{\eta}{\longrightarrow}& Y
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{(id,\delta_1)}}\uparrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{g}}
     \\
     X
  }
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #HomotopyEquivalence}
###### Definition

A [[continuous function]] $f \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Y$
is called a **[[homotopy equivalence]]** if there exists a 
continuous function $X \longleftarrow Y \;\colon\; g$
and [[left homotopies]], def. \ref{LeftHomotopy}

$$
  \eta_1 \;\colon\; f\circ g \Rightarrow_L id_Y
$$

and

$$
  \eta_2 \;\colon\; g\circ f \Rightarrow_L id_X
  \,.
$$

If here $\eta_2$ is constant along $I$, $f$ is is said to exhibit $X$ as a **[[deformation retract]]** of $Y$.

=--



Another key application of the concept of left homotopy is to the definition of [[homotopy groups]].

+-- {: .num_defn #HomotopyGroupsOftopologicalSpaces}
###### Definition

For $X$ a [[topological space]], then its set $\pi_0(X)$
of _[[connected components]]_, also called the **0-th homotopy set**, 
is the set of 
[[left homotopy]]-[[equivalence classes]] of points $\ast \to X$,
def.\ref{LeftHomotopy}. By [[composition]] this extends to a [[functor]]

$$
  \pi_0 \colon Top \longrightarrow Set
  \,.
$$

For $n \in \mathb{N}$, $n \geq 1$ and for $x \colon \ast \to X$
any point, then the $n$th **[[homotopy group]]** $\pi_n(X)$ of $X$ at $x$
is the [[group]] 

* whose underlying [[set]] is the set of [[left homotopy]]-[[equivalence classes]] of maps $I^n \longrightarrow X$ that take the [[boundary]] of $I^n$ to $x$ and where the left homotopies $\eta$ are constrained to be constant on the boundary;

* whose [[group]] product operation takes $[\alpha \colon I^n \to X]$ and $[\beta \colon I^n \to X]$ to $[\alpha \cdot \beta]$ with

$$
  \alpha \cdot \beta
  \;\colon\;
  I^n 
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  I^n \underset{I^{n-1}}{\sqcup} I^n
  \stackrel{(\alpha,\beta)}{\longrightarrow}
  X
  \,,
$$

where the first morphism is any [[homeomorphism]] from the unit $n$-[[cube]] to the $n$-cube with one side twice the unit length (see also at _[[positive dimension spheres are H-cogroup objects]]_).

By [[composition]], this construction extends to a [[functor]] 

$$
  \pi_{\bullet \geq 1}
    \;\colon\; 
  Top^{\ast/}
   \longrightarrow 
  Grp^{\mathbb{N}_{\geq 1}}
$$

from [[pointed topological spaces]] to [[graded object|graded]] [[group]].

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #WeakHomotopyEquivalenceOfTopologicalSpaces}
###### Definition

A [[continuous function]] $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$
is called  a **[[weak homotopy equivalence]]** if its image
under all the [[homotopy group]] functors of def. \ref{HomotopyGroupsOftopologicalSpaces}
is an [[isomorphism]], hence if 

$$
  \pi_0(f) \;\colon\; \pi_0(X) \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} \pi_0(X)
$$

and for all $x \in X$ and all $n \geq 1$

$$
  \pi_n(f) \;\colon\; \pi_n(X,x) \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} \pi_n(Y,f(y))
  \,.
$$


=--

+-- {: .num_example #TopologicalHomotopyEquivalencesAreWeakHomotopyEquivalences}
###### Example

Every [[homotopy equivalence]], def. \ref{HomotopyEquivalence}, is a weak homotopy equivalence, def. \ref{WeakHomotopyEquivalenceOfTopologicalSpaces}.

In particular a [[deformation retraction]], def. \ref{HomotopyEquivalence}, is a weak homotopy equivalence.

=--


+-- {: .num_example #FactoringTopologicalCodiagonalThroughCylinder}
###### Example

For $X\in Top$, the projection $X\times I \longrightarrow X$
from the [[cylinder object]] of $X$, def. \ref{TopologicalInterval},
is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]], def. \ref{WeakHomotopyEquivalenceOfTopologicalSpaces}. 

This means that the factorization 

$$
  \nabla_X 
  \;\colon\;
  X \sqcup X
  \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}
  X\times I
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
$$

of the [[codiagonal]] $\nabla_X$ in def. \ref{TopologicalInterval}, which in general is far from being a [[monomorphism]], may be thought of as factoring it through a monomorphism after replacing $X$, up to weak homotopy equivalence, by $X\times I$.

In fact $X \sqcup X \to X \times I$ has better properties than the generic monomorphism has, in particular better homotopy invariant properties:
it has the [[left lifting property]] against all [[Serre fibrations]] $ E \stackrel{p}{\longrightarrow} B$ (def. \ref{SerreFibration}) that are also [[weak homotopy equivalences]].

=--


For $Y$ a [[topological space]], the set $Hom_{Top}(I,Y)$ of continuous functions from the standard interval $I$, def. \ref{TopologicalInterval}, to $Y$ is the set of continuous paths in $X$. Every such path may be though of as a [[left homotopy]] between its endpoints. Hence a function $X \longrightarrow Hom_{Top}(I,Y)$ is an $X$-parameterized collection of such paths. In order for that to also give a concept of homotopy, we need to impose a continuity condition on how the paths may vary, hence we need to put a suitable [[topological space|topology]] on $Hom_{Top}(I,X)$. This is the [[compact-open topology]]:

+-- {: .num_defn #CompactOpenTopology}
###### Definition

For $X$ a [[topological space]] and $Y$ a [[locally compact topological space|locally compact]] [[Hausdorff topological space]], the **[[mapping space]]**

$$
  X^Y \in Top
$$

is the [[topological space]] 

* whose underlying set is the set $Hom_{Top}(Y,X)$ of [[continuous 
functions]] $Y \to X$, 

* whose [[open subsets]] are [[finitary intersections]] of [[unions]] of the following [[topological base|subbase]] of standard open subsets:

  the standard open subset $U_{K,U} \subset Hom_{Top}(Y,X)$ for 

  * $K \hookrightarrow Y$ a [[compact topological space]] subset

  * $U \hookrightarrow X$ an [[open subset]]

  is the subset of [[continuous functions]] $f$ of all those  that fit into a [[commuting diagram]] of the form

  $$
    \array{
       K &\hookrightarrow& Y
       \\
       \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
       \\
       U &\hookrightarrow& X
    }
    \,.
  $$

Accordingly this is called the _[[compact-open topology]]_ on the set of functions.

The construction extends to a [[functor]] 

$$
  (-)^{(-)} \;\colon\; Top_{lcH}^{op} \times Top \longrightarrow Top
  \,.
$$

=--
 
+-- {: .num_prop #MappingTopologicalSpaceIsExponentialObject}
###### Proposition

For $X$ a [[topological space]] and $Y$ a [[locally compact topological space|locally compact]] [[Hausdorff topological space]], the **topological [[mapping space]]** $X^Y$ from def. \ref{CompactOpenTopology} is an [[exponential object]]: there is a [[natural isomorphism|natural]] [[bijection]]

$$
  Hom_{Top}(Z \times Y, X) \simeq Hom_{Top}(Z, X^Y)
$$ 

between continuous functions out of any [[product topological space]] of $Y$ with any $Z \in Top$ and continuous functions from $Z$ into the mapping space.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Proposition \ref{MappingTopologicalSpaceIsExponentialObject} fails if $Y$ is not locally compact and Hausdorff. Therefore the plain category [[Top]] of all topological spaces is not a [[Cartesian closed category]]. 

This is no problem for the construction of the homotopy theory of topological spaces as such, but it becomes a technical nuisance when comparing it for instance to the [[simplicial homotopy theory]] via the singular [[nerve and realization]] adjunction, since it implies that [[geometric realization]] of [[simplicial sets]] does not necessarily preserve [[finite limits]].

On the other hand, without changing any of the following discussion one may just pass to a more [[convenient category of topological spaces]] such as notably the [[full subcategory]] of [[compactly generated topological spaces]] $Top_{ck} \hookrightarrow Top$ (def. \ref{kTop}) which is [[Cartesian closed category|Cartesian closed]].

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #TopologicalPathSpace}
###### Definition

For $X$ a [[topological space]], its **[[path space object]]** is the topological [[mapping space]] $X^I$, def. \ref{MappingTopologicalSpaceIsExponentialObject}, out of the standard interval $I$ of def. \ref{TopologicalInterval}.


=--

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

The endpoint inclusion into the standard interval, def. \ref{TopologicalInterval}, makes the path space $X^I$ of def. \ref{TopologicalPathSpace} factor the [[diagonal]] on $X$ through the inclusion of constant paths and the endpoint evaluation of paths:


$$
  \Delta_X
  \;\colon\; 
  X \stackrel{X^{I \to \ast}}{\longrightarrow} X^I \stackrel{X^{\ast \sqcup \ast \to I}}{\longrightarrow} X \times X
  \,.
$$

Here

1. $X^{I \to \ast}$ is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]];

1. $X^{\ast \sqcup \ast \to I}$ is a [[Serre fibration]].

So while in general the [[diagonal]] $\Delta_X$ is far from being an [[epimorphism]] or even just a [[Serre fibration]], the factorization through the [[path space object]] may be thought of as replacing $X$, up to weak homotopy equivalence, by its path space, such as to turn its diagonal into a Serre fibration after all.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

For $f,g\colon X \longrightarrow Y$ two [[continuous functions]] between [[topological spaces]] $X,Y$, then a **[[right homotopy]]** $f \Rightarrow_R g$ is a [[continuous function]]

$$
  \eta \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Y^I
$$

into the [[path space object]] of $X$, def. \ref{TopologicalPathSpace}, such that this fits into a [[commuting diagram]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    && Y
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{f}}\nearrow & \uparrow^{\mathrlap{X^{\delta_0}}}
    \\
    X &\stackrel{\eta}{\longrightarrow}& Y^I
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{g}}\searrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{Y^{\delta_1}}}
    \\
    Y
  }
  \,.
$$

##### Cell complexes

+-- {: .num_defn #TopologicalGeneratingCofibrations}
###### Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ write

* $D^n \coloneqq \{ \vec x\in \mathbb{R}^n | {\vert \vec x \vert \leq 1}\} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ for the standard topological [[n-disk]];

* $S^{n-1} = \partial D^n \coloneqq \{ \vec x\in \mathbb{R}^n | {\vert \vec x \vert = 1}\} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ for the standard topological [[n-sphere]];

Write

$$
  I_{Top}
    \coloneqq
  \{S^{n-1} \stackrel{\iota_n}{\hookrightarrow} D^{n}\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}
    \subset 
  Mor(Top)
$$

for the set of canonical [[boundary]] inclusion maps. This going to be called the set of standard **topological [[generating cofibrations]]**.

Notice that $S^{-1} = \emptyset$ and that $S^0 = \ast \sqcup \ast$.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #TopologicalCellComplex}
###### Definition

For $X \in Top$ and for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, an **$n$-cell attachment** to $X$ is the [[pushout]] of a generatic cofibration, def. \ref{TopologicalGeneratingCofibrations}

$$
  \array{
    S^{n-1} &\stackrel{\phi}{\longrightarrow}& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\iota_n}}\downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    D^n &\longrightarrow& X {}_\phi\underset{S^{n-1}}{\sqcup} D^n
  }
$$

along some [[continuous function]] $\phi$.

A continuous function $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ is called a **topological [[relative cell complex]]** if it is exhibited by a (possibly infinite) sequence of cell attachments to $X$, hence if it is a [[transfinite composition]] of [[pushouts]]

$$
  \array{
    \underset{i}{\coprod} S^{n_i - 1} &\longrightarrow& X_{k-1}
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\underset{i}{\coprod}\iota_{n_i}}}\downarrow 
     &(pb)& \downarrow  
    \\
    \underset{i}{\coprod} D^{n_i} &\longrightarrow& X_{k}
  }
$$

of [[coproducts]] of [[generating cofibrations]].

A topological space is a **[[cell complex]]** if $\emptyset \longrightarrow X$ is a relative cell complex.

A relative cell complex is called a **finite relative cell complex** if it is obtained from a [[finite number]] of cell attachments.

A (relative) cell complex is called a (relative) **[[CW-complex]]** if in the above transfinite composition is countable 

$$
  \array{
    X = X_0 &\longrightarrow& X_1 &\longrightarrow& X_2 &\longrightarrow& \cdots
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{f}}\searrow & \downarrow & \swarrow && \cdots
    \\
    && Y = \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim} X_\bullet
  }
$$

and if $X_k$ is obtained from $X_{k-1}$ by attaching cells precisely only of [[dimension]] $k$.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Strictly speaking a relative cell complex, def. \ref{TopologicalCellComplex}, is a function $f\colon X \to Y$, _together_ with its cell structure, hence together with the information of the pushout diagrams and the transfinite composition of the pushout maps that exhibit it.

In many applications, however,  all that matters is that there is _some_ (relative) cell decomosition, and then one tends to speak loosely and mean by a (relative) cell complex only a (relative) topological space that admits some cell decomposition.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #TopologicalCCellComplex}
###### Definition

For $C \subset Mor(\mathcal{C})$ any [[class]] of morphisms, the concept of  **relative $C$-cell complexes** is defined as in def. \ref{TopologicalCellComplex}, with the boundary inclusions $\iota_n \in I_{Top}$ replaced by the maps in $C$: 

a **relative $C$-cell complex** is a [[transfinite composition]] of [[pushouts]] of [[coproducts]] of the maps in $C \hookrightarrow Mor(Top)$.

=--

Given a relative $C$-cell complex $\iota \colon  X \to Y$, def. \ref{TopologicalCCellComplex}, it is typically interesting to study the [[extension]] problem along $f$, i.e. to ask which topological spaces $E$ are such that every [[continuous function]] $f\colon X \longrightarrow E$ has an extension $\tilde $ along $\iota$ 

$$
  \array{
    X &\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}& E
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\iota}}\downarrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\exists \tilde f}}
    \\
    Y
  }
  \,.
$$

If so, then this means that $E$ is sufficiently "spead out" with respect to the maps in $C$. More generally one considers this extension problem fiberwise, i.e. with both $E$ and $Y$ (hence also $X$) equipped with a map to some base space $B$.


+-- {: .num_defn #RightLiftingProperty}
###### Definition

Given a [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$ and a sub-[[class]] $C \subset Mor(\mathcal{C})$ of its [[morphisms]], then a morphism $p \colon E \longrightarrow B$ in $\mathcal{C}$ is said to have the [[right lifting property]] against the morphisms in $C$ if every [[commuting diagram]] in $\mathcal{C}$ of the form

$$
  \array{

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Def. \ref{SerreFibration} says, in view of the definition of [[left homotopy]], that a [[Serre fibration]] $p$ is a map with the property that given a [[left homotopy]], def. \ref{LeftHomotopy}, between two functions into its [[codomain]], and given a lift of one the two functions through $p$, then also the homotopy between the two lifts, in particular the second function lifts, too, and both lifts are related by left homotopy.

Therefore the condition on a [[Serre fibration]] is also called the _[[homotopy lifting property]]_ for maps whose domain is an [[n-disk]].

More generally one may ask functions $p$ to have such [[homotopy lifting property]] for functions with arbitrary domain. These are called _[[Hurewicz fibrations]]_.

#### Model category theory


In the [above](#BackgroundOnTopologicalHomotopyTheoryFromAlgebraicTopology) we discussed three classes of [[continuous functions]] between [[topological spaces]]

1. [[weak homotopy equivalences]];

1. [[relative cell complexes]];

1. [[Serre fibrations]]

and we saw first aspects of their interplay via [[lifting properties]]. 

A fundamental insight due to ([Quillen 67](#Quillen67)) is that in fact _all_ constructions in [[homotopy theory]] are elegantly expressible via just the abstract interplay of these classes of morphisms. This was distilled in ([Quillen 67](#Quillen67)) into a small set of [[axioms]] called a **[[model category]] structure** (because it serves to make all [[objects]] be _models_ for [[homotopy types]].)

First of all:

+-- {: .num_defn #CategoryWithWeakEquivalences}
###### Definition

A **[[category with weak equivalences]]** is

1. a [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$;

1. a sub-[[class]] $W \subset Mor(\mathcal{C})$ of its [[morphisms]];

such that

1. $W$ contains all the [[isomorphisms]] of $\mathcal{C}$;

1. $W$ is closed under **[[two-out-of-three]]**: in every [[commuting diagram]] in $\mathcal{C}$ of the form

   $$
     \array{
         & \nearrow&& \searrow
         \\ 
         &&
         \longrightarrow
     }
   $$
      
   if two of the three morphisms are in $W$, then so is the third.

=--

It turns out that a [[category with weak equivalences]], def. \ref{CategoryWithWeakEquivalences}, already determines a [[homotopy theory]]: the one given given by universally forcing weak equivalences to become actual [[homotopy equivalences]]. This may be made precise and is called the _[[simplicial localization]]_ of a category with weak equivalences ([Dwyer-Kan 80a](simplicial+localization#DwyerKanLocalizations), [Dwyer-Kan 80b](simplicial+localization#DwyerKanCalculating), [Dwyer-Kan 80c](simplicial+localization#DwyerKanFunctionComplexes)). However, without further auxiliary structure, these simplicial localizations are in general intractable. The further axioms of a [[model category]] serve the sole purpose of making the universal homotopy theory induced by a [[category with weak equivalences]] be tractable:

+-- {: .num_defn #ModelCategory}
###### Definition

A **[[model category]]** is

1. a [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$ with all small [[limits]] and [[colimits]];

1. three sub-[[classes]] $W, Fib, Cof \subset Mor(\mathcal{C})$ of its [[morphisms]];

such that

1. the class $W$ makes $\mathcal{C}$ into a **[[category with weak equivalences]]**, def. \ref{CategoryWithWeakEquivalences};

1. The systems $(W \cap Cof\;,\; Fib)$ and $(Cap\;,\; W\cap Fib)$ are [[weak factorization systems]].
 
=--

We now expand on what this means.

##### Lifting and extension


+-- {: .num_defn #LiftingAndExtension}
###### Definition

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be any [[category]]. 
Given a [[diagram]] in $\mathcal{C}$ of the form

$$
  \array{
     X &\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}& Y
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{p}}\downarrow
     \\
     B
  }
$$

then an *[[extension]]* of the [[morphism]] $f$ along the [[morphism]] $p$ is a completion to a [[commuting diagram]] of the form

$$
  \array{
     X &\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}& Y
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{p}}\downarrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\tilde f}}
     \\
     B
  }
  \,.
$$

Dually, given a [[diagram]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    && A
    \\
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    X &\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}& Y
  }
$$

then a **[[lift]]** of $f$ through $p$ is a completion to a [[commuting diagram]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    && A
    \\
    &{}^{\mathllap{\tilde f}}\nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    X &\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}& Y
  }
  \,.
$$

Combining these cases: given a square [[commuting diagram]] 

$$
  \array{
     X_1 &\stackrel{f_1}{\longrightarrow}& Y_1
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{p_l}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p_r}}
     \\
     X_2 &\stackrel{f_1}{\longrightarrow}& Y_2     
  }
$$

then a **[[lifting]]** in the diagram is a completion to a [[commuting diagram]] of the form

$$
  \array{
     X_1 &\stackrel{f_1}{\longrightarrow}& Y_1
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{p_l}}\downarrow &\nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p_r}}
     \\
     X_2 &\stackrel{f_1}{\longrightarrow}& Y_2     
  }
  \,.
$$

Given a sub-[[class]] of morphhisms $C \subset Mor(\mathcal{C})$, then a morphism $p_r$ as above is said to have the **[[right lifting property]]** against $C$ if in all square diagrams with $p_r$ on the right and any $p_l \in C$ on the left a lift exists. Dually, a fixed $p_l$ is said to have the **[[left lifting property]]** against $C$ if in all square diagrams with $p_l$ on the left and any $p_r \in C$ on the left a lift exists.

+-- {: .num_remark #RetractsOfMorphisms}
###### Remark

By a [[retract]] of a [[morphism]] $X \stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow} Y$ in some [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$ we mean a retract of $f$ as an object in the [[arrow category]] $\mathcal{C}^{\Delta[1]}$, hence a morphism $A \stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow} B$ such that in $\mathcal{C}^{\Delta[1]}$ there is a factorization of the identity on $g$ through $f$

$$
  id_g \;\colon\;
  g \longrightarrow f \longrightarrow g

###### Lemma
**([[retract argument]])**

Consider a [[composition|composite]] morphism

$$
  f \;\colon\; \stackrel{i}{\longrightarrow} \stackrel{p}{\longrightarrow}
  \,.
$$

1. If $f$ has the [[left lifting property]] against $p$, then $f$ is a [[retract]] of $i$.

1. If $f$ has the [[right lifting property]] against $i$, then $f$ is a [[retract]] of $p$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof 
(of lemma \ref{RetractArgument})

We discuss the first statement, the second is [[formal duality|formally dual]].

Write the factorization of $f$ as a [[commuting square]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    X &\stackrel{i}{\longrightarrow}& A 
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    Y &= & Y
  }
  \,.
$$

By the assumed [[lifting property]] of $f$ against $p$ there exists a diagonal filler $g$ making a [[commuting diagram]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    X &\stackrel{i}{\longrightarrow}& A 
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow &{}^{\mathllap{g}}\nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    Y &= & Y
  }
  \,.
$$

By rearranging this diagram a little, it is equivalent to 

$$
  \array{
    & X &=& X 
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow 
     &&
    {}^{\mathllap{i}}\downarrow 
    \\
    id_Y \colon & Y &\underset{g}{\longrightarrow}& A &\underset{p}{\longrightarrow}&
    Y
  }
  \,.
$$

Completing this to the right, this yields a diagram exhibiting the required retract according to remark \ref{RetractsOfMorphisms}:

$$
  \array{
    id_X \colon & X &=& X &=& X
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow 
     &&
    {}^{\mathllap{i}}\downarrow 
     &&
     {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow
    \\
    id_Y \colon & Y &\underset{g}{\longrightarrow}& A &\underset{p}{\longrightarrow}&
    Y
  }
  \,.
$$


=--


##### The small object argument

Given a class $C \subset Mor(\mathcal{C})$ of morphisms in some [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$, a natural question is how to factor any given morphism $f\colon X \longrightarrow Y$ through a relative $C$-cell complex, def. \ref{TopologicalCCellComplex}, followed by a $C$-[[injective morphism]], def. \ref{RightLiftingProperty}

$$
  f 
    \;\colon\; 
  X 
    \stackrel{\in C cell}{\longrightarrow} 
  \hat X
    \stackrel{\in C inj}{\longrightarrow} 
  Y
  \,.
$$

A first approximation to such a factorization turns out to be given simply by forming $\hat X = X_1$ by attaching **all** possible $C$-cells to $X$. Namely let

$$
  (C/f) 
   \coloneqq
  \left\{
    \array{
       dom(c) &\stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}& X
       \\
       {}^{\mathllap{c\in C}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
       \\
       cod(c) &\longrightarrow& Y
    }
  \right\}
$$

be the set of **all** ways to find a $C$-cell attachment in $f$, and consider the [[pushout]] $\hat X$ of the [[coproduct]] of morphisms in $C$ over all these:

$$
  \array{
    \underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} dom(c) &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} c}}\downarrow
    &(po)& 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{}}
    \\
    \underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} cod(c)
    &\longrightarrow&
    X_1
  }
  \,.
$$

This gets already close to producing the intended factorization: 

First of all the resulting map $X \to X_1$ is a $C$-relative cell complex, by construction. 

Second, by the fact that the coproduct is over all commuting squres to $f$, the morphism $f$ itself makes a [[commuting diagram]] 

$$
  \array{
    \underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} dom(c) &\longrightarrow& X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} c}}\downarrow
    && 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    \underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} cod(c)
    &\longrightarrow&
    Y
  }
$$

and hence the [[universal property]] of the [[colimit]] means that $f$ is indeed factored through that $C$-cell complex $X_1$; we may suggestively arrange that factorizing diagram like so:

$$
  \array{
    \underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} dom(c) 
      &\longrightarrow& 
    X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{id}}\downarrow
    && 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{}}
    \\
    \underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} dom(c)
     &&
    X_1
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} c}}\downarrow 
    &\nearrow& \downarrow
    \\
    \underset{c\in(C/f)}{\coprod} cod(c)
    &\longrightarrow&
    Y
  }
  \,.
$$

This shows that, finally, the colimiting [[co-cone]] map -- the one that now appears diagonally -- **almost** exhibits the desired right lifting of $X_1 \to X$ against the $c\in C$. The failure of that to hold on the nose is only the fact that a horizontal map in the middle of the above diagram is missing: the diagonal map obtained above lifts not all commuting diagrams of $c\in C$ into $f$, but only those where the top morphism $dom(c) \to X_1$ factors through $X \to X_1$.

The idea of the [[small object argument]] now is to fix this only problem by iterating the construction: next factor $X_1 \to X$ in the same way into 

$$
  X_1 \longrightarrow X_2 \longrightarrow X
$$

and so forth. Since relative $C$-cell complexes are closed under composition, at stage $n$ the resulting $X \longrightarrow X_n$ is still a $C$-cell complex, getting bigger and bigger. But accordingly, the failure of the accompanying $X_n \longrightarrow Y$ to be a $C$-[[injective morphism]] becomes smaller and smaller, for it now lifts against all diagrams where $dom(c) \longrightarrow X_n$ factors through $X_{n-1}\longrightarrow X_n$, which intuitively is less and less of a condition as the $X_{n-1}$ grow larger and larger.

The concept of _[[small object]]_ is just what makes this intuition precise and finishes the small object argument. For the present purpose we just need the following simple version:

+-- {: .num_defn #ClassOfMorphismsWithSmallDomains}
###### Definition

The continuous functions with the [[right lifting property]], def. \ref{RightLiftingProperty} against the set $I_{Top} = \{S^{n-1}\hookrightarrow D^n\}$ of topological [[generating cofibrations]], def. \ref{TopologicalGeneratingCofibrations}, are precisely those which are both [[weak homotopy equivalences]], def. \ref{WeakHomotopyEquivalenceOfTopologicalSpaces} as well as [[Serre fibrations]], def. \ref{SerreFibration}.

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We break this up into three sub-statements:

**A) $I_{Top}$-injective morphisms are in particular weak homotopy equivalences**

Let $p \colon \hat X \to X$ have the [[right lifting property]] against $I_{Top}$

$$
  \array{
    S^{n-1}  &\longrightarrow & \hat X
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\iota_n}}\downarrow &{}^{\mathllap{\exists}}\nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    D^n &\longrightarrow& X
  }
$$

We check that the lifts in these diagrams exhibit $\pi_\bullet(f)$ as being an [[isomorphism]] on all [[homotopy groups]], def. \ref{HomotopyGroupsOftopologicalSpaces}:


For $n = 0$ the existence of these lifts says that every point of $X$ is in the image of $p$, hence that $\pi_0(\hat X) \to \pi_0(X)$ is [[surjection|surjective]]. Let then $S^0 = \ast \coprod \ast \longrightarrow \hat X$ be a map that hits two connected components, then the existence of the lift says that if they have the same image in $\pi_0(X)$ then they were already the same connected component in $\hat X$. Hence $\pi_0(\hat X)\to \pi_0(X)$ is also [[injection|injective]] and hence is a [[bijection]].

Similarly, for $n \geq 1$, if $S^n \to \hat X$ represents an element in $\pi_n(\hat X)$ that becomes trivial in $\pi_n(X)$, then the existence of the lift says that it already represented the trivial element itself. Hence $\pi_n(\hat X) \to \pi_n(X)$ has trivial [[kernel]] and so is injective. 

Finally, to see that $\pi_n(\hat X) \to \pi_n(X)$ is also surjective, hence bijective, observe that every elements in $\pi_n(X)$ is equivalently represented by a commuting diagram of the form

$$
  \array{
    S^{n-1} &\longrightarrow& \ast &\longrightarrow& \hat X
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    D^n &\longrightarrow& X &=& X
  }  
$$

and so here the lift gives a representative of a preimage in $\pi_{n}(\hat X)$.

**B) $I_{Top}$-fibrations are in particular Serre fibrations**

By lemma \ref{SaturationOfGeneratingCofibrations} an $I_{Top}$-fibration has also the [[right lifting property]] against all [[relative cell complexes]], and hence by lemma \ref{TopologicalGeneratingAcyclicCofibrationsAreRelativeCellComplexes} it is also a $J_{Top}$-fibration, hence a Serre fibration.

**C) Acyclic Serre fibrations are in particular $I_{Top}$-fibrations**

A proof of this is spelled out in ([Hirschhorn 15, section 6](#Hirschhorn15)).

Hence by the [[small object argument]], prop. \ref{SmallObjectArgument}, $f$ factors as an $I_{Top}$-relative cell complex, hence just a plain relative cell complex, followed by an $I_{Top}$-fibration, def. \ref{RightLiftingProperty}.

###### Proposition

Every morphism $f\colon X \longrightarrow Y$ in [[Top]] factors as an acyclic classical cofibration followed by a fibration, def. \ref{ClassesOfMorhismsInTopQuillen}:

$$
  f
  \;\colon\;
  X 
    \stackrel{cofib_{we}}{\longrightarrow}
  \hat X
    \stackrel{fib}{\longrightarrow}
  Y
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By lemma \ref{TopologicalGeneratingAcyclicCofibrationsAreRelativeCellComplexes} a relative $J_{Top}$-cell complex is in particular a relative $I_{Top}$-cell complex. 

By lemma \ref{CompactSubsetsAreSmallInCellComplexes}
the set $J_{Top} = \{D^n \hookrightarrow D^n\times I\}$ of 
topological [[generating acyclic cofibrations]], def. \ref{TopologicalGeneratingAcyclicCofibrations}, has small domains, in the sense of def. \ref{ClassOfMorphismsWithSmallDomains} (the [[n-disks]] are [[compact topological space|compact]]). Hence by the [[small object argument]], prop. \ref{SmallObjectArgument}, $f$ factors as an $J_{Top}$-relative cell complex, followed by an $J_{top}$-fibration, def. \ref{RightLiftingProperty}:

$$
  f
  \;\colon\;
  X 
   \stackrel{J_{Top} cell}{\longrightarrow}
  \hat X
    \stackrel{J_{Top} fib}{\longrightarrow}
  X
  \,.
$$

By definition this makes $\hat X \to X$ a [[Serre fibration]], hence a fibration.

By lemma \ref{TopologicalGeneratingAcyclicCofibrationsAreRelativeCellComplexes} a relative $J_{Top}$-cell complex is in particular a relative $I_{Top}$-cell complex and hence $X \to \hat X$ is a cofibration.

Finally, to see that relative $J_{Top}$-cell complexes are weak homotopy equivalences, first notice that with the elements $D^n \hookrightarrow D^n \times I$ of $J_{Top}$ themselves, also each stage $X_{k} \to X_{k+1}$ in the construction of $\hat X$ via the [[small object argument]] is a [[strong deformation retract]], hence, by example \ref{TopologicalHomotopyEquivalencesAreWeakHomotopyEquivalences}, a weak homotopy equivalence. Now the [[small object argument]] with lemma \ref{CompactSubsetsAreSmallInCellComplexes} applies once more to give that every representative and every null homotopy of elements in $\pi_n(\hat X)$ already exist at some stage $X_n$, hence that also $\underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_{k} \pi_\bullet(X_k)\to \pi_\bullet(\hat X)$ is an isomorphism.

Every [[commuting diagram|commuting square]] in [[Top]] with the left morphism a classical cofibration and the right morphism a fibration, def. \ref{ClassesOfMorhismsInTopQuillen}

$$
  \array{
    &\longrightarrow&

$$

admits a [[lift]] as soon as one of the two is also a weak equivalence.


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

**A)** If the fibration $f$ is also a weak equivalence, then lemma \ref{AcyclicSerreFibrationsAreTheJTopFibrations} says that it has the right lifting property against the generating cofibrations $I_{Top}$, and lemma \ref{SaturationOfGeneratingCofibrations} implies the claim.

**B)** If the cofibration $g$ on the left is also a weak equivalence, consider any factorization into a relative $J_{Top}$-cell complex, def. \ref{TopologicalGeneratingAcyclicCofibrations}, def. \ref{TopologicalCCellComplex}, followed by a fibration,

$$
  g \;\colon\; \stackrel{J_{Top} cell}{\longrightarrow} \stackrel{fib}{\longrightarrow}
  \,,
$$

as in the proof of prop. \ref{ContinuousFunctionsFactorAsQuillenAcyclicCofibrationFollowedBySerreFibration}. Now by [[two-out-of-three]], prop. \ref{QuillenWeakEquivalencesSatisfyTwoOutOfThree}, the factorizing fibration is actually an acyclic fibration. By case A), this acyclic fibration has the [[right lifting property]] against the cofibration $g$ itself, and so the [[retract argument]], lemma \ref{RetractArgument}, gives that $g$  is a [[retract]] of a relative $J_{Top}$-cell complex. With this, finally lemma \ref{SaturationOfGeneratingCofibrations} implies that $f$ has the [[right lifting property]] against $g$.

### **P.2)** Simplicial homotopy theory 
 {#SimplicialSets}


The nature of [[objects]] in any [[category]] is not determined by how we present these objects, but by the web of [[morphisms]] relating them ([[structuralism]]). In this respect, the objects of the classical homotopy category [[Ho(Top)]] [above](#TheClassicalHomotopyCategory) turn out to have lost the geometric nature of [[topology]] to retain only a more set-theoretic combinatorial nature. This is more explicitly captured by the concept of _[[simplicial sets]]_ and their _[[simplicial homotopy theory]]_.

**Literature.** ([Goerss-Jardine 96, chapter I](#GoerssJardine96), [Joyal-Tierney 05](#JoyalTierney05)). 

#### Background from combinatorial topology

##### Simplicial sets

Simplicial sets are secretly well familiar already in basic [[algebraic topology]]: they reflect just the abstract structure carried by the [[singular simplicial complexes]] of topological spaces, as in the definition of [[singular homology]] and [[singular cohomology]]. 

Conversely, every simplicial set may be [[geometric realization|geometrically realized]] as a topological space. These two [[adjoint]] operations turn out to exhibit the homotopy theory of simplicial sets as being equivalent ([[Quillen equivalence|Quillen equivalent]]) to the homotopy theory of topological spaces.  For some purposes, working in [[simplicial homotopy theory]] is preferable over working with topological homotopy theory.

The sets $(Sing X)_\bullet$ here are closely related by an interlocking system of maps that make them form what is called a _[[simplicial set]]_, and as such the collection of these sets of singular simplices is called the _[[singular simplicial complex]]_ of $X$. We discuss the definition of simplicial sets now and then come back to this below in def. \ref{SingularSimplicialComplex}.

Since the topological $n$-simplices $\Delta^n$ from def. \ref{TopologicalSimplex} sit inside each other by the face inclusions of def. \ref{FaceInclusionInBarycentricCoords}

$$
  \delta_k : \Delta^{n-1} \to \Delta^{n}

and project onto each other by the degeneracy maps, def. \ref{DegeneracyProjectionsInBarycentricCoords}

we dually have functions

that send each singular $n$-simplex to its $k$-face and functions

It is straightforward to check by explicit inspection that the evident injection and restriction maps between the sets of [[singular simplices]] make $(Sing X)_\bullet$ into a simplicial set. However for working with this, it is good to streamline a little:

This is called the "simplex category" because we are to think of the object $[n]$ as being the "[[spine]]" of the $n$-[[simplex]]. For instance for $n = 2$ we think of $0 \to 1 \to 2$ as the "spine" of the triangle. This becomes clear if we don't just draw the morphisms that _generate_ the category $[n]$, but draw also all their composites. For instance for $n = 2$ we have_

Moreover, the [[geometric realization]] of $Sing X$ is a model for the same [[homotopy type]] as that of $X$, but with the special property that it is canonically a [[cell complex]] -- a [[CW-complex]]. Better yet, $Sing X$ is itself already good cell complex, namely a [[Kan complex]]. We come to this below.

The the basic invariants of [[simplicial sets]]/[[Kan complexes]] in [[simplicial homotopy theory]] are their [[simplicial homotopy groups]], to which we turn now.
 
Given that a [[Kan complex]] is a special [[simplicial set]] that [[homotopy hypothesis|behaves like]] a combinatorial model for a [[topological space]], the _simplicial homotopy groups_ of a  Kan complex are accordingly the combinatorial analog of the [[homotopy groups]] of [[topological spaces]]: instead of being maps from topological [[spheres]] modulo maps from topological disks, they are maps from the [[boundary of a simplex]] modulo those from the [[simplex]] itself. 

Accordingly, the definition of the discussion of simplicial homotopy groups is essentially literally the same as that of [[homotopy groups]] of topological spaces.  One technical difference is for instance that the definition of the group structure is slightly more non-immediate for simplicial homotopy groups than for topological homotopy groups (see below).

For $x \in X_0$ a vertex and for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $n \geq 1$, then the underlying [[set]]  of the **$n$th [[simplicial homotopy group]]** of $X$ at $x$ -- denoted $\pi_n(X,x)$ -- is, the set of [[equivalence classes]] $[\alpha]$ of morphisms

from the simplicial $n$-[[simplex]] $\Delta^n$ to $X$, such that these take the [[boundary of a simplex|boundary of the simplex]] to $x$, i.e. such that they fit into a [[commuting diagram]] in [[sSet]] of the form

These sets are taken to be equipped with the following group structure.

+-- {: .num_defn #ProductOnSimplicialHomotopyGroups}
###### Definition 
  
For $X$ a [[Kan complex]], for $x\in X_0$, for $n \geq 1$ and for  $f,g \colon \Delta[n] \to X$ two representatives of $\pi_n(X,x)$ as in def. \ref{UnderlyingSetsOfSimplicialHomotopyGroups}, consider the following $n$-simplices in $X_n$:

$$
  v_i 
  \coloneqq
  \left\{
    \array{
      s_0 \circ s_0 \circ \cdots \circ s_0 (x) & for \; 0 \leq i \leq  n-2
      \\
      f & for \; i = n-1
      \\
      g & for \; i = n+1
    }
  \right.
$$

This corresponds to a morphism $\Lambda^{n+1}[n] \to X$ from a [[horn]] of the $(n+1)$-[[simplex]] into $X$. By the [[Kan complex]] property of $X$ this morphism has an [[extension]] $\theta$ through the $(n+1)$-[[simplex]] $\Delta[n]$

$$
  \array{
     \Lambda^{n+1}[n] & \longrightarrow & X
     \\
     \downarrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\theta}}
     \\
     \Delta[n+1]
  }
$$

From the [[simplicial identities]] one finds that the boundary of the $n$-simplex arising as the $n$th boundary piece $d_n \theta$ of $\theta$ is constant on $x$

$$
  d_i d_{n} \theta = d_{n-1} d_i \theta = x

All the degenerate $n$-simplices $v_{0 \leq i \leq n-2}$ in def. \ref{ProductOnSimplicialHomotopyGroups} are just there so that the gluing of the two $n$-cells $f$ and $g$ to each other can be regarded as forming the boundary of an $(n+1)$-simplex except for one face. By the Kan extension property that missing face exists, namely $d_n \theta$.  This is a choice of gluing composite of $f$ with $g$.

###### Proof

The inclusions ${{\Lambda^n}_{Top}}_k \hookrightarrow \Delta^n_{Top}$ of topological horns into topological simplices are  [[retracts]], in that there are [[continuous maps]] $\Delta^n_{Top} \to {{\Lambda^n}_{Top}}_k$ given by "squashing" a topological $n$-simplex onto parts of its boundary, such that

$$
  ({{\Lambda^n}_{Top}}_k \to \Delta^n_{Top} \to

$$

Therefore the map
$[\Delta^n, \Pi(X)] \to [\Lambda^n_k,\Pi(X)]$ is an epimorphism, since it is equal to  to $Top(\Delta^n, X) \to Top(\Lambda^n_k, X)$ which has a right inverse $Top(\Lambda^n_k, X) \to Top(\Delta^n, X)$.

Moreover, for all $n$ the morphisms $\Delta[n] \to \Delta[0] \to \Delta[n]$ are [[left homotopy|left homotopic]] to $\Delta[n] \stackrel{id}{\to} \Delta[n]$ and so applying lemma \ref{PullbackOfKanFibrationSendsLeftHomotopyToFiberwiseHomotopyequivalence} and prop. \ref{FiberwiseHomotopyEquivalenceOfMinimalFibrationsIsIso} once more yields that the fiber over each $\Delta[n]$ is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to $\Delta[n]\times F$.

The **acyclic fibrations** in $sSet_{Quillen}$(i.e. the maps that are both fibrations as well as weak equivalences) between [[Kan complexes]] are precisely the morphisms $f : X \to Y$ that have the [[right lifting property]] with respect to all inclusions $\partial \Delta[n] \hookrightarrow \Delta[n]$ of boundaries of $n$-simplices into their $n$-simplices
  $$
    \array{
      \partial \Delta[n] &\to& X
      \\
      \downarrow &{}^\exists\nearrow& \downarrow^f 
      \\
      \Delta[n] &\to& Y
    }
    \,.

This appears spelled out for instance as ([Goerss-Jardine, theorem 11.2](#GoerssJardine)).


In fact:

###### Proposition

$sSet_{Quillen}$ is a [[cofibrantly generated model category]] with

* generating cofibrations the [[boundary]] inclusions $\partial \Delta[n] \to \Delta[n]$;

* generating acyclic cofibrations the [[horn]] inclusions $\Lambda^i[n] \to \Delta[n]$.

=--



+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

Let $W$ be the smallest class of morphisms in $sSet$ satisfying the following conditions:

1. The class of monomorphisms that are in $W$ is closed under [[pushout]], [[transfinite composition]], and [[retracts]].
2. $W$ has the [[two-out-of-three]] property in $sSet$ and contains all the [[isomorphisms]].
3. For all natural numbers $n$, the unique morphism $\Delta [n] \to \Delta [0]$ is in $W$.

Then $W$ is the class of weak homotopy equivalences.
=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

* First, notice that the horn inclusions $\Lambda^0 [1] \hookrightarrow \Delta [1]$ and $\Lambda^1 [1] \hookrightarrow \Delta [1]$ are in $W$.
* Suppose that the horn inclusion $\Lambda^k [m] \hookrightarrow \Delta [m]$ is in $W$ for all $m \lt n$ and all $0 \le k \le m$. Then for $0 \le l \le n$, the horn inclusion $\Lambda^l [n] \hookrightarrow \Delta [n]$ is also in $W$.
* Quillen's [[small object argument]] then implies all the trivial cofibrations are in $W$.
* If $p : X \to Y$ is a trivial Kan fibration, then its right lifting property implies there is a morphism $s : Y \to X$ such that $p \circ s = id_Y$, and the two-out-of-three property implies $s : Y \to X$ is a trivial cofibration. Thus every trivial Kan fibration is also in $W$.
* Every weak homotopy equivalence factors as $p \circ i$ where $p$ is a trivial Kan fibration and $i$ is a trivial cofibration, so every weak homotopy equivalence is indeed in $W$.
* Finally, noting that the class of weak homotopy equivalences satisfies the conditions in the theorem, we deduce that it is the _smallest_ such class.

=--

As a corollary, we deduce that the classical model structure on $sSet$ is the smallest (in terms of weak equivalences) model structure for which the cofibrations are the monomorphisms and the weak equivalences include the (combinatorial) homotopy equivalences.

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

Let $\pi_0 : sSet \to Set$ be the connected components functor, i.e. the left adjoint of the constant functor $cst : Set \to sSet$. A morphism $f : Z \to W$ in $sSet$ is a weak homotopy equivalence if and only if the induced map
$$\pi_0 K^f : \pi_0 K^W \to \pi_0 K^Z$$
is a bijection for all _Kan complexes_ $K$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

One direction is easy: if $K$ is a Kan complex, then axiom SM7 for [[simplicial model categories]] implies  the functor $K^{(-)} : sSet^{op} \to sSet$ is a right [[Quillen functor]], so Ken Brown's lemma implies it preserves all weak homotopy equivalences; in particular, $\pi_0 K^{(-)} : sSet^{op} \to Set$ sends weak homotopy equivalences to bijections.

Conversely, when $K$ is a Kan complex, there is a natural bijection between $\pi_0 K^X$ and the hom-set $Ho (sSet) (X, K)$, and thus by the [[Yoneda lemma]], a morphism $f : Z \to W$ such that the induced morphism $\pi_0 K^W \to \pi_0 K^Z$ is a bijection for all Kan complexes $K$ is precisely a morphism that becomes an isomorphism in $Ho (sSet)$, i.e. a weak homotopy equivalence.

#### Quillen equivalence between $sSet_{Quillen}$ and $Top_{Quillen}$
 {#QuillenEquivalenceWithTopQuillen}

Let $C$ and $D$ be [[model category|model categories]] and let

$$
  (L \dashv R) : C \stackrel{\overset{R}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{L}{\to}}
   D
$$

be a [[Quillen adjunction]] with $L$ [[left adjoint]] to $R$.

Write $Ho C$ and $Ho D$ for the corresponding [[homotopy category|homotopy categories]].

Notice that $Ho C$ may be regarded as obtained by first passing to the full [[subcategory]] on cofibrant objects and then [[localization|inverting]] [[weak equivalences]], and $L$ (being a left Quillen adjoint) preserves weak equivalences between cofibrant objects.  Thus, $L$ induces a functor 

$$
  \mathbb{L} : Ho C \to Ho D
$$ 

between the [[homotopy category|homotopy categories]], called its (total) left [[derived functor]].  Similarly (but dually), $R$ induces a (total) right derived functor $\mathbb{R} : Ho D \to Ho C$.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

The Quillen adjunction $(L \dashv R)$ is a **Quillen equivalence** if the following equivalent conditions are satisfied.

* The total left [[derived functor]] $\mathbb{L} : Ho(C) \to Ho(D)$ is an [[equivalence of categories|equivalence]] of the [[homotopy categories]];

* The total right [[derived functor]] $\mathbb{R} : Ho(D) \to Ho(C)$ is an [[equivalence of categories|equivalence]] of the [[homotopy categories]];

* For every cofibrant object $c \in C$ and every fibrant object $d \in D$, a morphism $c \to R(d)$ is a weak equivalence in $C$ precisely when the [[adjunct]] morphism $L(c) \to d$ is a weak equivalence in $D$.

* For every cofibrant object $c\in C$, the composite $c \to R(L(c)) \to R(L(c)^{fib})$ is a weak equivalence in $C$, and for every fibrant object $d\in D$, the composite $L(R(d)^{cof}) \to L(R(d)) \to d$ is a weak equivalence in $D$, where $(-)^{fib}$ and $(-)^{cof}$ denote fibrant and cofibrant [[resolutions]], respectively.

###### Theorem

The [[singular simplicial complex]]/[[geometric realization]]-[[nerve and realization|adjunction]] of example \ref{TopologicalRealizationOfSimplicialSets}
constitutes a [[Quillen equivalence]] of the classical model structure $sSet_{Quillen}$ of def. \ref{ClassesOfMorphismsOnsSetQuillen} with the  [[classical model structure on topological spaces]], def. \ref{ClassesOfMorhismsInTopQuillen}:

$$

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First of all, the adjunction is indeed a [[Quillen adjunction]]: prop. \ref{SingDetextsAndReflectsFibrations} says in particular that $Sing(-)$ takes [[Serre fibrations]] to [[Kan fibrations]] and prop. \ref{TopologicalRealizationOfsSetLandsInCWComplexes} gives that ${\vert-\vert}$ sends monomorphisms of simplicial sets to [[relative cell complexes]].

Now prop. \ref{UnitOfSingularNerveAndRealizationIsWEOnKanComplexes} says that the derived adjunction unit and counit are weak equivalences, and hence the Quillen adjunction is a Quillen equivalence.

### **P.3)** Homotopy fiber sequences

A key aspect of [[homotopy theory]] is that the [[universal constructions]] of [[category theory]], such as [[limits]] and [[colimits]], receive a refinement whereby their [[universal properties]] hold not just up to [[isomorphism]] but up to ([[weak homotopy equivalence|weak]]) [[homotopy equivalence]]. One speaks of _[[homotopy limits]]_ and _[[homotopy colimits]]_.

We consider this here just for the special case of [[homotopy fibers]] and [[homotopy cofibers]], leading to the phenomenon of [[homotopy fiber sequences]] and their induced [[long exact sequences of homotopy groups]] which control much of the theory to follow.

#### Mapping cones

The _[[mapping cone]]_ of a [[morphism]] $f : X \to Y$ in some [[homotopical category]] (precisely: a [[category of cofibrant objects]]) is, if it exists, a particular representative of the [[homotopy cofiber]] of $f$. 

It is also called the _homotopy [[cokernel]]_ of $f$ or the _[[weak quotient]]_ of $Y$ by the [[image]] of $X$ in $Y$ under $f$. 



The mapping cone construction is a means to _present_ in a [[category with weak equivalences]] the following canonical
construction in [[homotopy theory]]/[[(∞,1)-category theory]].

+-- {: .num_defn #InfinityCokernel}
###### Definition

In an [[(∞,1)-category]] $\mathcal{C}$ with [[terminal object]] and [[(∞,1)-pushout]], the [[homotopy fiber|homotopy cofiber]] of a [[morphism]] $f : X \to Y$ is the [[homotopy pushout]]

$$
  coker(f) \coloneqq Y \coprod_X {*}

hence the object [[universal construction]] sitting universally in a [[diagram]] of the form

$$

     X &\stackrel{}{\to}& {*}
     \\
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}} &\swArrow_{\simeq}& \downarrow

$$

in $C$ using any [[cylinder object]] $cyl(X)$ for $X$.

Intuitively this says that $cone(f)$ is the object obtained by

1. forming the cylinder over $X$;

1. gluing to one end of that the object $Y$ as specified by the map $f$.

1. shrinking the other end of the cylinder to the point.

Intuitively it is clear that this way every [[cycle]] in $Y$ that happens to be in the image of $X$ can be "continuously" translated in the cylinder-direction, keeping it constant in $Y$, to the other end of the cylinder, where it becomes the point. This means that every [[homotopy group]] of $Y$ in the image of $f$ vanishes in the mapping cone. Hence in the mapping conee **the image of $X$ under $f$ in $Y$ is removed up to homotopy**. This makes it clear how $cone(f)$ is a homotopy-version of the [[cokernel]] of $f$. And therefore the name "mapping cone".

###### Remark

A morphism $\eta : cyl(X) \to Y$ out of a [[cylinder object]] is a [[left homotopy]] $\eta : g \Rightarrow h$ (def. \ref{LeftHomotopyOfSimplicialSets}) between its restrictions $g\coloneqq \eta(0)$ and $h \coloneqq \eta(1)$ to the cylinder boundaries

$$
  \array{
     X
     \\
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i_0}} & \searrow^{\mathrlap{g}}
     \\
     cyl(X) &\stackrel{\eta}{\to}& Y
     \\
     \uparrow^{\mathrlap{i_1}} & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{h}}
     \\
     X
  }
  \,.
$$

Therefore prop. \ref{HomotopyCofiberByFactorizationLemma} says that 
the mapping cone is the the [[universal property|universal]] object with a morphism $i$ from $Y$ and a [[left homotopy]] from $i \circ f$ to the [[zero morphism]]. This is of course also precisely what def. \ref{InfinityCokernel} is saying.

###### Proposition

The colimit in prop. \ref{HomotopyCofiberByFactorizationLemma} may be computed in two stages by two consecutive [[pushouts]] in $C$, and in two ways by the following [[pasting diagram]]:

$$
  \array{
    && X &\stackrel{f}{\to}& Y
    \\
    && \downarrow^{i_1} && \downarrow
    \\
    X &\stackrel{i_0}{\to}& cyl(X) &\to & cyl(f)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    {*} &\to& cone(X) &\to& cone(f) 
  }
  \,.
$$

Here every square is a [[pushout]], (and so by the [[pasting law]] is every rectangular pasting composite).

=--

This now is a basic fact in ordinary [[category theory]]. The pushouts appearing here go by the following names:

+-- {: .num_defn #CylindersAndCones}
###### Definition

The pushout

$$
  \array{
     X &\stackrel{i_0}{\to}& cyl(X)
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     {*} &\to& cone(X)
  }
$$

defines the **[[cone]]** $cone(X)$ over $X$ (with respect to the chosen [[cylinder object]]): the result of taking the [[cylinder object|cylinder]] over $X$ and identifying one $X$-shaped end with the [[point]].

The pushout 

$$
  \array{
    X &\stackrel{f}{\to}& Y
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    cyl(X) &\to& cyl(f)
  }
$$

defines the **[[mapping cylinder]]** $cyl(f)$ of $f$, the result of identifying one end of the cylinder over $X$ with $Y$, using $f$ as the gluing map.

The pushout 

$$
  \array{
    cyl(x) &\to& cyl(f)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    cone(X) &\to& cone(f)
  }
$$

defines the **mapping cone** $cone(f)$ of $f$: the result of forming the cylinder over $X$ and then identifying one end with the point and the other with $Y$, via $f$.

Dually, the **[[mapping cocone]]** is a presentation of homotopy fibers.


#### Homotopy cartesian squares

+-- {: .num_prop #HomotopyPullbackByOrdinaryPullback}
###### Proposition

Let $A \to C \leftarrow B$ be a [[diagram]] in some [[model category]]. Then sufficient conditions for the ordinary (1-categorical) [[pullback]] $A \times_C B$ to present the homotopy pullback of the diagram are

* one of the two morphisms is a [[fibration]] and all three objects are [[fibrant objects]];

* one of the two morphisms is a [[fibration]] and the model category is [[right proper model category|right proper]].

=--

The proof of the second statement is spelled out [here](proper+model+category#HomotopyLimits).

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

Notice that a fibrant [[resolution]] of the diagram in the injective [[model structure on functors]] has _both_ morphisms be a fibration. So the first point in prop. \ref{HomotopyPullbackByOrdinaryPullback} says that (in the special case of pullbacks) something weaker than this is sufficient for computing the [[homotopy limit]] of the diagram.

This can be explained in model-categorical terms by the fact that the category of [[cospans]] also has a [[Reedy model structure]] in which the fibrant objects are precisely those considered in the first point above, and that homotopy limits can equally well be computed using this model structure (specifically, the [[adjunction]] $Const \dashv Lim$ is [[Quillen adjunction|Quillen]] with respect to it).

In this spirit one may ask for the largest class of morphisms such that their ordinary pullbacks are already homotopy pullbacks. This is related to the concept of _[[sharp morphisms]]_.

=--



Due to prop. \ref{HomotopyPullbackByOrdinaryPullback} one typically computes homotopy pullbacks of a diagram by first forming a [[resolution]] of one of the two morphisms by a fibration and then forming an ordinary pullback. 

+-- {: .num_cor #HomotopyPullbackByFactorizationLemma}
###### Corollary

If in $A \stackrel{f}{\to} C \stackrel{g}{\leftarrow} B$ 
all three objects are [[fibrant objects]], then
the homotopy pullback of this diagram is presented by the ordinary [[pullback]]

$$
  \array{
     A\times_C^h B & \to & C^I \times_C B
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow 
    \\
     A & \stackrel{f}{\to} & C
  }

$$

or, equivalently up to [[isomorphism]], as the ordinary [[pullback]]

$$
  \array{
     A\times_C^h B & \to & C^I
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow

  }
  \,.
$$

See also at _[[Mayer-Vietoris sequence]]_ [this proposition](Mayer-Vietoris+sequence#SequenceFromDiagonal).

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
Since the objects are already fibrant, prop. \ref{HomotopyPullbackByOrdinaryPullback} implies that it is sufficient to replace one of the morphisms by a fibrant resolution.
Such a resolution is provided by the [[factorization lemma]]: by [Lemma 3](factorization+lemma#FibrantResolution), $B \to C$ admits a canonical fibrant resolution
  $$ C^I \times_C B \twoheadrightarrow C $$
where $C \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} C^I \to C \times C$ is a [[path space object]] for $C$ (for instance, when $C$ is a [[closed monoidal homotopical category]] then this can be taken to be the [[internal hom]] with an [[interval object]] $I$).
=--

The homotopy pullback constructed in this way is an example of a _strict homotopy limit_, as mentioned at [[homotopy limit]].  In such a case, one can say that an arbitrary homotopy-commutative square

$$
  \array{
   W & \to& Y
   \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
   \\
   X &\to& Z
  }
$$

is a homotopy pullback square if the induced morphism from $W$ to the strict homotopy pullback is a [[weak equivalence]].



Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[category of fibrant objects]], such as the category $KanCplx \hookrightarrow sSet$ of [[Kan complexes]] or the category [[Top]] of ([[convenient category of topological spaces|convenient]]) [[topological spaces]].

$$

2) By one of the axioms for a category of fibrant objects, the arrows $Y \to 1$ and $X \to 1$ are fibrations. 

By one of the axioms for a category of fibrant objects, it follows from 1) and 2) that $p_{X}$ and $p_{Y}$ are fibrations.

The morphisms $d_0 : X^I \to X$ and $d_1 : X^I \to X$ are both [[trivial fibrations]].

2) By one of the axioms for a category of fibrant objects, $id_X$ is a weak equivalence. 

By the 2-out-of-3 axiom for a category of fibrant objects, we deduce from 1), 2), and the fact that $c$ is a weak equivalence, that $d_{0}$ is a weak equivalence.

An entirely analogous argument demonstrates that $d_{1}$ is a weak equivalence.

###### Lemma
**(Fibrant resolution of a morphism).**
Let $f : X \to Y$ a morphism in $\mathcal{C}$.  There exists a canonical [[fibration]] $g : X \times_Y Y^I \twoheadrightarrow Y$ which factors through $f$ via a [[trivial fibration]] $s: X \times_Y Y^I \stackrel{\sim}{\twoheadrightarrow} X$.
Here $Y^I$ is a [[path space object]] for $Y$.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
Let $d = (d_0, d_1) : Y^I \twoheadrightarrow Y \times Y$ be the canonical [[fibration]].  Let $s : X \times_Y Y^I \stackrel{\sim}{\twoheadrightarrow} X$ denote the [[base change]] of $d_0$ along $f$; this is a [[trivial fibration]] because $d_0$ is by lemma 2, and trivial fibrations are stable under base change.

Let $g$ denote the composite
  $$ g : X \times_Y Y^I \to Y^I \stackrel{d_1}{\twoheadrightarrow} Y. $$
One can see that this is a fibration by observing that it is the same as the composite
  $$ X \times_Y Y^I \to X \times_Y Y \times Y = X \times Y \to X \times e = X $$
where $e$ is the [[final object]] of $C$.
Here, the first morphism $id_X \times_Y d$ is a fibration because it is a base change of the fibration $d$; the second is a fibration because it is a base change of the fibration $Y \to e$ ($Y$ is [[fibrant object|fibrant]]).

**(Factorization lemma).**

###### Proof
Let $p : \hat X = X \times_Y Y^I \twoheadrightarrow Y$ be a [[fibration|fibrant]] resolution of $f$ as in Lemma 3, so that there is a commutative diagram

   \array{
      \hat X & \overset{s}{\to} & X \\
          & \underset{p}{\searrow} & \downarrow{f} \\
          & & Y 
   }
$$
Let $j : Y \stackrel{\sim}{\to} Y^I$ denote the canonical [[weak equivalence]].  Since the square
$$
   \array{
      X & \overset{id_X}{\to} & X \\
      \downarrow{j f} & & \downarrow{f} \\
      Y^I & \overset{d_0}{\to} & Y
   }
$$
commutes, one gets an induced morphism $i = (id_X, j f) : X \to \hat X$ by the [[universal property]] of the [[pullback]], which by definition has left inverse $s$ and makes the diagram
$$
   \array{
      X &  \overset{i}{\to}             & \hat X \\
          & \underset{f}{\searrow} & \downarrow p \\

Given a morphism $f \colon A \longrightarrow B$ there is the following pasting composite of [[homotopy fibers]]

$$
  \array{
    \cdots && \vdots
    \\
    && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    && \Omega ker(f) &\longrightarrow& \Omega A &\longrightarrow& \ast
    \\
    && \downarrow &\swArrow& \downarrow &\swArrow& \downarrow
    \\
    && \ast &\longrightarrow& \Omega B &\stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}& ker(f) &\longrightarrow& \ast
    \\
    && && \downarrow &\swArrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{g}} &\swArrow& \downarrow
    \\
    && && \ast &\longrightarrow& A &\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}& B
  }
$$


hence a long [[homotopy fiber sequence]] of morphisms 

$$
  \cdots
    \to
  \Omega ker(f)
    \longrightarrow
  \Omega A 
    \stackrel{\Omega f}{\longrightarrow}
  \Omega B 
    \longrightarrow 
  ker(f) 
    \stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow}
  A 
    \stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow} B
  \,.
$$

###### Remark

A subtlety to be aware of here is that $\Omega B$ is not quite $ker(ker(f))$, but the latter instead is $\bar \Omega f$, where $\bar \Omega$ denotes loops with reversed orientation.

A classical discussion of this in terms of computing homotopy fibers via [[path object]] fibrant replacements is e.g. in
([Switzer 75, around 2.57](#Switzer75)). But let's see it just diagrammatically:

First observe that it is indeed $\Omega f$ and not $\bar \Omega f$ that appears in the above: by "bending around" the bottom left "$\ast \to $" we get

$$
  \array{
    \Omega A &\longrightarrow& \ast
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\Omega f}} && \downarrow
    \\
    \Omega B & \longrightarrow & ker(f) &\longrightarrow& \ast
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{g}} && \downarrow
    \\
    \ast &\longrightarrow & A &\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}& B
  }
  \;\;\;\;\;
  \simeq  
  \;\;\;\;\;
  \left(
  \array{
    \ast &\longrightarrow& \ast
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    ker(f) &\longrightarrow& \ast
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{g}} && \downarrow
    \\
    A &\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}& B
    \\
    \uparrow && \uparrow
    \\
    \ast &\longrightarrow& \ast
  }
  \right)
  \stackrel{\underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}}{\mapsto}
  \left(
    \Omega A \stackrel{\Omega f}{\longrightarrow} \Omega B
  \right)
  \,.
$$

On the other hand, if we define the homotopy fiber of any morphism $\phi$ by the diagram

$$
  \array{
    ker(\phi) &\longrightarrow& \ast
    \\
    \downarrow &\swArrow& \downarrow
    \\
    & \stackrel{\phi}{\longrightarrow} & 
  }
$$

then $ker(g)$ is given by the diagram

$$
  \array{
    ker(g) &\longrightarrow& \ast
    \\
    \downarrow &\swArrow& \downarrow
    \\
    ker(f) &\stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow}& A
  }
$$

but what appears in the above pasting diagram is instead this diagram "reflected at the diagonal axis"

$$
  \array{
    ker(g) &\longrightarrow& \ast
    \\
    \downarrow &\swArrow& \downarrow
    \\
    ker(f) &\stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow}& A
  }
  \;\;\;
  \simeq
  \;\;\;
  \array{
    \Omega B &\longrightarrow& \ast
    \\
    \downarrow &\swArrow& \downarrow
    \\
    ker(f) &\stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow}& A
  }
  \;\;\;\;
  \simeq
  \;\;\;\;
  \left(
  \array{
    \Omega B &\longrightarrow& ker(f)
    \\
    \downarrow &\swArrow& \downarrow
    \\
    \ast &\longrightarrow& A
  }
  \right)^{-1}
$$

Here "$(-)^{-1}$" denotes the inverse of the [[2-morphism]] ([[homotopies]]). Since it is these 2-morphisms/homotopies that become the loops in the loop space, it is here that loop reversal appears in translating between the naive iterated homotopy fiber to the construction that actually appears in the above pasting composite.

yields a [[long exact sequence]] (of groups, ending in pointed sets)

## **Part 1) Stable homotopy theory**

We set up [[stable homotopy theory]].
 
**Literature.** For a decent quick idea see ([Malkiewich 14](#Malkiewich14)).
For a little more details the original lecture ([Adams 74, part III sections 2-7](#Adams74)) is still recommendable (except where it considers the [[stable homotopy category]] in its incarnation as the [[Adams category]], better to consider the [[homotopy category]] of the [[Bousfield-Friedlander model structure]]; we go through this [below](#Spectra)). A genuine textbook account is ([Schwede 12](#Schwede12)).

$\,$

The [[stable homotopy category]] is to be the proper [[stabilization]] of the classical [[homotopy category]] [[Ho(Top)]] $\simeq$ [[Ho(sSet)]] under the operation of forming [[loop space objects]] $\Omega$ and [[reduced suspensions]] $\Sigma$: via forming [[suspension spectra]] $\Sigma^\infty$ every [[pointed object]] in the classical [[homotopy category]] maps to the stable homotopy category, and under this map the [[loop space]]- and [[reduced suspension]]-[[functors]] become inverse [[equivalence of categories|equivalences]] on the stable homotopy category.

$$
  \array{
     Ho(Top)^{\ast/} 
      &
      \underoverset{\underset{\Omega}{\longrightarrow}}{\overset{\Sigma}{\longleftarrow}}{} 
      &
     Ho(Top)^{\ast/}
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\Sigma^\infty}}\downarrow \dashv \uparrow^{\mathrlap{\Omega^\infty}}
     &&
     {}^{\mathllap{\Sigma^\infty}}\downarrow \dashv \uparrow^{\mathrlap{\Omega^\infty}}
     \\
     Ho(Spectra) 
     &
     \underoverset{\underset{\Omega}{\longrightarrow}}{\overset{\Sigma}{\longleftarrow}}{\simeq}
     &
     Ho(Spectra)
  }
  \,.
$$


In contrast to the classical [[homotopy category]], the stable homotopy category is a [[triangulated category]] (a shadow of the fact that the [[(∞,1)-category of spectra]] is a [[stable (∞,1)-category]]). As such it may be thought of as a refinement of the [[derived category]] [[category of chain complexes|of chain complexes]] (of [[abelian groups]]): every [[chain complex]] gives rise to a [[spectrum]] and every [[chain map]] to a map between these spectra (the [[stable Dold-Kan correspondence]]), but there are many more spectra and maps between them than arise from chain complexes and chain maps.


There is a variety of different models for the [[stable homotopy theory]] of spectra, some of which roughly fits into a hierarchy like so:

1. [[sequential spectra]] with their [[model structure on sequential spectra]]

1. [[symmetric spectra]] with their [[model structure on symmetric spectra]]

1. [[orthogonal spectra]] with their [[model structure on orthogonal spectra]]

1. [[excisive functors]] with their [[model structure for excisive functors]]

As one moves down this list, the objects modelling the spectra become richer. This means on the one hand that their abstract properties become better as one moves down the list, on the other hand it means that it is more immediate to construct and manipulate examples as one stays further up in the list. 

We start with plain sequential spectra [below](#SequentialSpectra) as a transparent means to see the [[stable homotopy category]]. When we get to the discussion of [[ring spectra]] [eventually](#RingSpectra) with the basic applications in mind, it is convenient to pass to the richer model of [[symmetric spectra]], [further below](#SymmetricSpectra).

But first we now consider some facts in plain ("un-stable") [[algebraic topology]]/[[homotopy theory]] that serve to motivate the passeage to [[stable homotopy theory]] in the first place.

### Motivating theorems

The 0th approximation to making [[Ho(Top)]] become more like an [[abelian category]] is passage to [[pointed topological spaces]], and [[pointed objects|pointed]] [[simplicial sets]]:

every category of [[pointed objects]] has 

1. a [[zero object]] (the point) and [[zero morphisms]] (those factoring through the point);

1. a canonical non-Cartesian [[tensor product]], the _[[smash product]]_ $\wedge$.

Given the base point, there is the [[loop space]]-construction $\Omega(-) \simeq [S^1,-]$ on that base point. It has a [[left adjoint]], the [[reduced suspension]] operation $\Sigma(-) \simeq S^1 \wedge (-)$.

Motivation for stabilization under $(\Sigma \dashv \Omega)$:

* [[Eckmann-Hilton argument]] (...[[May recognition theorem]])

* [[Freudenthal suspension theorem]]

* [[triangulated category]]-structure on [[Spanier-Whitehead category]]

Further motivation which is the subject of the [seminar](#ComplexOrientedCohomology):

* [[generalized cohomology]]

  * [[suspension isomorphism]]

  * [[Brown representability theorem]]

* [[cobordism theory]]

  [[Thom's theorem]]




### **1.1)** Sequential spectra
 {#SequentialSpectra}

The most lighweight model for [[spectra]] are _[[sequential spectra]]_. They support most of [[stable homotopy theory]] in a straightforward way, and have the advantage that examples tend to be immediate (for instance the proof of the [[Brown representability theorem]] spits out sequential spectra). 

The key disadvantage of sequential spectra is that they do not support a functorial [[smash product of spectra]] before passing to the [[stable homotopy category]], much less a [[symmetric smash product of spectra]]. This is the structure needed for a decent discussion of the [[higher algebra]] of [[ring spectra]]. To accomodate this, further [below](#SymmetricSpectra) we enhance sequential spectra to the slightly richer model of [[symmetric spectra]]. But both these models are connected by a [[free-forgetful adjunction]] and for workinbg with either model it is useful to pass back and forth.

#### Sequential pre-spectra 

+-- {: .num_defn #SequentialSpectrum}
###### Definition

A **[[sequential spectrum]]** (or sequential [[pre-spectrum]], for emphasis) in [[simplicial sets]], is an $\mathbb{N}$-[[graded object|graded]] [[pointed object|pointed]] [[simplicial set]] $X_\bullet$ equipped with morphisms $\sigma_n \colon S^1 \wedge X_n \to X_{n+1}$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, where $S^1 \coloneqq \Delta[1]/\partial\Delta[1]$ is the minimal simplicial [[circle]], and where $\wedge$ is the [[smash product]] of [[pointed objects]].

 A [[homomorphism]] $f \colon X \to Y$ of spectra is a sequence $f_\bullet \colon X_\bullet \to Y_\bullet$ of homomorphisms of pointed simplicial sets, such that all [[diagrams]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    S^1 \wedge X_n &\stackrel{S^1 \wedge f_n}{\longrightarrow}& S^1 \wedge Y_n
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\sigma_n^X}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\sigma_n^Y}}
    \\
    X_{n+1} &\stackrel{f_{n+1}}{\longrightarrow}& Y_{n+1}
  }
$$

[[commuting diagram|commute]].

Write $SeqSpec(sSet)$ for this [[category]] of sequential spectra.

+-- {: .num_example #SmashProductOfSpectrumWithSimplicialSet}
###### Example

For $X \in SeqSpec(sSet)$ and $K \in $ [[sSet]], hence $K_+ \in sSet^{\ast/}$ then $X \wedge K_+$ is the sequential spectrum degreewise given by the [[smash product]] of pointed objects

$$
  (X \wedge K_+)_n \coloneqq (X_n \wedge K_+)
$$

and with structure maps given by

$$
  S^1 \wedge (X_n \wedge K_+) \simeq (S^1 \wedge X_n) \wedge K_+ \stackrel{\sigma_n \wedge K_+}{\longrightarrow} X_{n+1}\wedge K_+
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #SimplicialEnrichment}
###### Proposition

The category $SeqSpec$ of def. \ref{SequentialSpectrum} becomes a [[simplicially enriched category]] (in fact an $sSet^{\ast/}$-[[enriched category]]) with [[hom objects]] $[X,Y]\in sSet$ given by

$$
  [X,Y]_n \coloneqq Hom_{SeqSpec(sSet)}(X\wedge \Delta[n]_+,Y)

Say that a homomorphism $f_\bullet \colon X_\bullet \to Y_\bullet$ in the category $SeqSpec(sSet)$, def. \ref{SequentialSpectrum} is

* a **strict weak equivalence** if each component $f_n \colon X_n \to Y_n$ is a weak equivalence in the [[classical model structure on simplicial sets]] (hence a [[weak homotopy equivalence]] of [[geometric realizations]]);

* a **strict weak equivalence** if each component $f_n \colon X_n \to Y_n$ is a fibration in the [[classical model structure on simplicial sets]] (hence a [[Kan fibration]]);

* a **strict cofibration** if the simplicial maps $f_0\colon X_0 \to Y_0$ as well as all [[pushout products]] of $f_n$ with the structure maps of $X$

  $$
    X_{n+1}\underset{S^1 \wedge X_n}{\coprod} S^1 \wedge Y_n

###### Proposition

The classes of morphisms in def. \ref{ClassesOfMorphismsOfTheStrictModelStructureOnSequentialSpectra} give the structure of a [[model category]] $SeqSpec(sSet)_{strict}$, called the **strict [[Bousfield-Friedlander model structure]]** on sequential spectra.

Moreover, this is

* a [[proper model category]];

* a [[simplicial model category]] with respect to the simplicial enrichment of prop. \ref{SimplicialEnrichment}.

=--

([Bousfield-Friedlander+model+structure#Bousfield-Friedlander 78, prop. 2.2](#BousfieldFriedlander78)).


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Write $sSet^{\mathbb{N}}$ for the category of $\mathbb{N}$-sequences of simplicial sets. This may be thought of as the category of [[simplicial presheaves]] on the [[discrete category]] $\mathbb{N}^{op}$, and as such it carries the projective [[model structure on functors]]/[[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] $sSet^{\mathbb{N}}_{proj}$.

Consider then the [[free-forgetful adjunction]]

$$
  SeqSpectra(sSet)
  \stackrel{\overset{F}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{U}{\longrightarrow}}
  sSet^{\mathbb{N}}
$$

and the corresponding [[transferred model structure]] $SeqSpectra(sSet)_{strict}$,

$$
  SeqSpectra(sSet)_{strict}
  \stackrel{\overset{F}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{U}{\longrightarrow}}
  sSet^{\mathbb{N}}_{proj}
  \,.
$$

It only remains to check that the cofibrations are as claimed. To that end, consider a [[commuting square]] of sequential spectra

$$
  \array{
    X_\bullet &\stackrel{h_\bullet}{\longrightarrow}& A_\bullet
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f_\bullet}} && \downarrow
    \\
    Y_\bullet &\longrightarrow& B_\bullet
  }
  \,.
$$

By definition, this is equivalently a $\mathbb{N}$-collection of commuting diagrams of simplicial sets of the form

$$
  \array{
    X_n &\stackrel{h_n}{\longrightarrow}& A_n
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f_n}} && \downarrow
    \\
    Y_n &\longrightarrow& B_n
  }
$$

such that all structure maps are respected.

$$
  \array{
    X_n &\stackrel{\sigma_n^X}{\longrightarrow}& X_{n+1}
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f_n}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f_{n+1}}}
    \\
    Y_n &\stackrel{\sigma_n^Y}{\longrightarrow}& Y_{n+1}
    \\
    & \searrow && \searrow
    \\
    && B_n &\stackrel{\sigma_n^B}{\longrightarrow}& B_{n+1}
  }
  \;\;\;
  \Rightarrow
  \;\;\;
  \array{
    X_n &\stackrel{\sigma_n^X}{\longrightarrow}& X_{n+1}
    \\
    & \searrow^{\mathrlap{h_n}} && \searrow^{\mathrlap{h_{n+1}}}
    \\
    && A_n &\stackrel{\sigma_n^A}{\longrightarrow}& A_{n+1}
    \\
    && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    && B_n &\stackrel{\sigma_n^B}{\longrightarrow}& B_{n+1}
  }
  \,.
$$

Hence a [[lifting]] in the original diagram is a lifting in each degree $n$, such that the lifting in degree $n+1$ makes these diagrams of structure maps commute.

Since components are parameterized over $\mathbb{N}$, this condition has solutions by [[induction]]. First of all there must be an ordinary lifting in degree 0. Then assume a lifting $l_n$ in degree $n$ has been found

$$
  \array{
    X_n &\stackrel{h_n}{\longrightarrow}& A_n
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f_n}} &\nearrow_{\mathrlap{l_n}}& \downarrow
    \\
    Y_n &\longrightarrow& B_n
  }
$$

the lifting $l_{n+1}$ in the next degree has to also make the following diagram commute

$$
  \array{
    X_n &\stackrel{\sigma_n^X}{\longrightarrow}& X_{n+1}
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f_n}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{h_{n+1}}}
    & \searrow 
    \\
    Y_n &\stackrel{\sigma_n^Y}{\longrightarrow}& Y_{n+1}
    && 
    \\
    & \searrow^{\mathrlap{l_n}} && \searrow^{\mathrlap{l_{n+1}}} & \downarrow
    \\
    && A_n &\stackrel{\sigma_n^A}{\longrightarrow}& A_{n+1}
  }
  \,.
$$

This is a [[cocone]] under the the commuting square for the structure maps, and therefore the outer diagram is equivalently a morphism out of the [[domain]] of the [[pushout product]] $f_n \Box \sigma_n^X$, while the compatible lift $l_{n+1}$ is equivalently a lift against this pushout product:

$$
  \array{
    Y_n \underset{X_n}{\sqcup} X_{n+1}
    &\stackrel{(\sigma_n^A l_n,h_{n+1})}{\longrightarrow}&
    A_{n+1}
    \\
    \downarrow &{}^{\mathllap{l_{n+1}}}\nearrow& \downarrow
    \\
    Y_{n+1} &\stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}& B_{n+1}
  }
  \,.

In order to do [[stable homotopy theory]] with [[sequential spectra]], we need to equip the [[category]] of sequential [[pre-spectra]] of def. \ref{SequentialSpectrum} with a [[model category]] structure whose weak equivalences are the [[stable weak homotopy equivalences]] of def. \ref{StableWeakEquivalenceOfSequentialsSetSpectra}. This class contains the degreewise weak homotopy equivalences of the strict model structure of def. \ref{ClassesOfMorphismsOfTheStrictModelStructureOnSequentialSpectra} but is strictly larger. There are then different choices for the fibrations and cofibrations, but it is particularly convenient to keep the cofibrations those of the strict model structure, for then we are in the situation of [[Bousfield localization of model categories]]:

+-- {: .num_defn #BousfieldLocalizationOfModelCategories}
###### Definition


A _left [[Bousfield localization of model categories|Bousfield localization]]_ $C_{loc}$ of a [[model category]] $C$ is another model category structure on the same underlying category with the same cofibrations, 

$$
  cof_{C_{loc}} = cof_c
$$

but more weak equivalences

$$
  W_{C_{loc}} \supset W_C
  \,.
$$

=--

While that's a very simple definition, it turns out that something interesting happens to the fibrations when we keep the cofibrations fixed and increase the weak equivalences.

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark 

In def. \ref{BousfieldLocalizationOfModelCategories} it follows directly that 

* $C_{loc}$ has as fibrations a subset of fibrations of $C$

  $$
    fib_{C_{loc}} = rlp(cof_{C_{loc}} \cap W_{C_{loc}})
    \subset rlp(cof_{C_{loc}} \cap W_C) = fib_{C}
    \,.
  $$

* $C_{loc}$ has the same acyclic fibrations as $C$

  $$
    fib_{C_{loc}} \cap W_{C_{loc}}
    =
    rlp(cof_{C_{loc}}) = rlp(cof_C) = fib_C \cap W_C
    \,.
  $$

* on the underlying categories

  * the identity functor $Id : C \to C_{loc}$ preserves cofibrations and weak equivalences

  * the identity functor $Id : C_{loc} \to C$ preserves fibrations and acyclic fibrations

  so that this pair of functors is a [[Quillen adjunction]]

  $$
    C_{loc} \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\to} C
    \,,
  $$

The category $C^\circ$ _modeled_ by a model category $C$ is its [[full subcategory]] on fibrant-cofibrant objects. Under left Bousfield localization the fibrant-cofibrant objects of $C_{loc}$ are a subcollection of those of $C$, so that we have the full subcategory

$$
  (C_{loc})^\circ \subset C^\circ
  \,.
$$

Moreover, as we shall see, every object in $C$ is weakly equivalent in $C_{loc}$ to one in $C_{loc}$: it _reflects into $C_{loc}$_ .

Hence Bousfield localization is a model category version of reflecting onto a [[reflective subcategory]].

=--

(...)



In the situation of sequential spectra, we have more structure controlling the left Bousfield localization:

1. every sequential pre-spectrum is weakly equivalent to an [[Omega-spectrum]], def. \ref{OmegaSpectrum};

1. the strict weak equivalences between [[Omega-spectra]] are already [[stable weak homotopy equivalences]].

The structures in both these items are reflected by the [[spectrification]] [[endofunctor]] $Q$ of def. \ref{Spectrification}.

The _[[Bousfield-Friedlander theorem]]_ which we discuss now  states that if an [[endofunctor]] $Q \colon \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}$ on a [[model category]] $\mathcal{C}$ behaves like an [[idempotent monad]] in an appropriate model category theoretic sense, then the [[left Bousfield localization]] [[model category]] structure of $\mathcal{C}$ at the $Q$-equivalences exists.



+-- {: .num_defn #QuillenIdempotentMonad}
###### Definition

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[proper model category]]. 
Say that a **Quillen idempotent monad** on $\mathcal{C}$ is
 
1. an [[endofunctor]] 

   $Q \;\colon\;  \mathcal{C} \longrightarrow \mathcal{C}$

1. a [[natural transformation]]

   $\eta \colon id_{\mathcal{C}} \longrightarrow Q$

such that

1. $Q$ preserves weak equivalences;

1. all $Q(\eta_X) \colon Q(X) \longrightarrow Q(Q(X))$ are weak equivalences;

1. if in a [[pullback]] square in $\mathcal{C}$

   $$
     \array{
       f^\ast W &\stackrel{f^\ast h}{\longrightarrow}& X
       \\
       \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
       \\
       W &\stackrel{h}{\longrightarrow}& Y
     }
   $$

   we have that

   1. $f$ is a fibration and $Y$ is fibrant;

   1. $Q(\eta_X)$, $Q(\eta_Y)$ and $Q(h)$ are weak equivalences

   then $Q(f^\ast h)$ is a weak equivalence.

###### Definition

For $Q \colon \mathcal{C} \longrightarrow \mathcal{C}$
a Quillen idempotent monad according to def. \ref{QuillenIdempotentMonad}, say that a morphism $f$ in $\mathcal{C}$ is

1. a **$Q$-weak equivalence** if $Q(f)$ is a weak equivalence;

1. **a $Q$-cofibation** if it is a cofibration.

1. **a $Q$-fibration** if it has the [[right lifting property]] against the morphisms that are both ($Q$-)cofibrations as well as $Q$-weak equivalences.

Write $\mathcal{C}_Q$ for $\mathcal{C}$ equipped with these classes of morphisms.

+-- {: .num_lemma #FirstLemmaForBousfieldFriedlander}
###### Lemma

In the situation of def. \ref{ClassesOfMorphismsInBousfieldLocalizationAtQuillenIdempotentMonad}, 
a morphism is an acyclic fibration in $\mathcal{C}_Q$ precisely if it is an acyclic fibration in $\mathcal{C}$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

It is clear from the definition that an acyclic fibration is also a  $Q$-acyclic $Q$-fibration. In the other direction, let $f$ be a $Q$-acyclic $Q$-fibration. Consider its factorization into a cofibration followed by an acyclic fibration

$$
  f \colon \underoverset{\in Cof}{i}{\longrightarrow} \underoverset{\in W \cap Fib}{p}{\longrightarrow}
  \,.
$$

Now the fact that $Q$ preserves weak equivalences together with [[two-out-of-three]] implies that $i$ is a $Q$-weak equivalence, hence a $Q$-acyclic $Q$-cofibration. This means by assumption that $f$ has the [[right lifting property]] against $i$. Hence the [[retract argument]], implies that $f$ is a [[retract]] of the acyclic fibration $p$, and so is itself an acyclic fibration.

###### Lemma

In the situation of def. \ref{ClassesOfMorphismsInBousfieldLocalizationAtQuillenIdempotentMonad}, if a morphism $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ is a fibration, and $\eta_X, \eta_Y$ are weak equivalences, then $f$ is a $Q$-fibration.

The proof of this is a little fiddly. Full details are spelled out in ([Goerss-Jardine 96, chapter X, lemma 4.4](#GoerssJardine96)).

###### Proposition
**([[Bousfield-Friedlander theorem]])**

For $Q \colon \mathcal{C} \longrightarrow \mathcal{C}$
a Quillen idempotent monad according to def. \ref{QuillenIdempotentMonad},
then $\mathcal{C}_Q$, def. \ref{ClassesOfMorphismsInBousfieldLocalizationAtQuillenIdempotentMonad} is a [[model category]].

=--

([Bousfield-Friedlander 78, theorem 8.7](Bousfield-Friedlander+theorem#BousfieldFriedlander78), [Bousfield 01, theorem 9.3 ](Bousfield-Friedlander+theorem#Bousfield01))

Warning: this proof assumes that $\mathcal{C}$ admits [[functorial factorization]].

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The [[two-out-of-three]] poperty for $Q$-fibrations is evident. We discuss the two factorization conditions, from these the lifting follows by the [[retract argument]].

First, lemma \ref{FirstLemmaForBousfieldFriedlander} directly implies that every morphism factors as a $Q$-cofibration followed by a $Q$-acyclic $Q$-fibration, simply by factoring it as a cofibration followed by an acyclic fibration.

For the other factorization, let $f \colon X \longrightarrow Y$ be a morphism. By applying functorial fibrant replacement to $Q(f) \to \widehat{Q(f)}$ in $\mathcal{C}^{\Delta[1]}_{inj}$ and composing this with $\eta_f$ yields a diagram 

$$
  \array{
     X &\underoverset{}{\eta_X}{\longrightarrow}& Q(X) &\underoverset{W\cap Cof}{u}{\longrightarrow}& \widehat{Q(X)}
     \\
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{Q(f)}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{{\widehat{Q(f)} \atop {\in Fib}}}}
     \\
     Y &\underoverset{}{\eta_Y}{\longrightarrow}& Q(Y) &\underoverset{W\cap Cof}{v}{\longrightarrow}& \widehat{Q(Y)}
  }
  \,.
$$

Since $u$ is a weak equivalence, using the weak idempotency of $Q$ and [[two-out-of-three]] in the naturality square of $\eta$ on $u$ gives that $\eta_{\widehat{Q(X)}}$ is a weak equivalence. By the same argument $\eta_{\widehat{Q(Y)}}$ is a weak equivalence. From this, lemma \ref{SecondLemmaForBousfieldFriedlander} gives that $\widehat{Q(f)}$ is a $Q$-fibration.

Next, observe that the total bottom morphism $v \circ \eta_X$ is a $Q$-equivalence by the first two conditions on $Q$. Hence the third condition on $Q$ says that the pullback $\widehat{Q(f)}^\ast(v \circ \eta_X) \colon E \to \widehat{Q(X)}$ is also a $Q$-equivalence

$$
  \array{
     E &\underoverset{\in W_Q}{}{\longrightarrow}& \widehat{Q(X)}
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{g \atop {\in Fib_Q}}}\downarrow &(pb)& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\widehat{Q(f)}}}
     \\
     Y &\underset{v \circ \eta_X}{\longrightarrow}& \widehat{Q(Y)}
  }
  \,.
$$

Then by [[two-out-of-three]] for $Q$-weak equivalences, the induced morphism $X \to E$ is a $Q$-weak equivalence, so by the previous factorization statement it factors as

$$
  X 
    \overset{W_Q \cap Cof_Q}{\longrightarrow} 
  D
    \stackrel{W_Q \cap Fib_Q}{\longrightarrow} 
  E
  \,.
$$

The resulting composite

$$
  f  
    \;\colon\;
    X 
      \overset{W_Q \cap Cof_Q}{\longrightarrow} 
    D
      \stackrel{W_Q \cap Fib_Q}{\longrightarrow} 
      \underoverset{g}{Fib_Q}{\longrightarrow}
    Y
$$

is the desired factorization.

### **1.2)** Structured spectra
 {#DiagramSpectra}


Given that [[spectra]] are the analog in [[homotopy theory]] of [[abelian groups]], we want to consider [[algebra]] -- the theory of [[rings]] and their [[modules]] -- [[internalization|internal]] to spectra. This "[[higher algebra]]" ([below](#HigherAlgebra)) accordingly is the theory of [[ring spectra]] and [[module spectra]].

[[!include homological and higher algebra -- table]]

Hence where a [[ring]] is equivalently a [[monoid]] with respect to the [[tensor product of abelian groups]], we are after a corresponding [[tensor product]] of [[spectra]]. This is to be the [[smash product of spectra]], induced by the [[smash product]] on [[pointed topological spaces]]/[[pointed object|pointed]] [[simplicial sets]].


There is a key point to be dealt with here: the [[smash product of spectra]] has to exhibit a certain _graded commutativity_. Informally, there are two ways to see this:

First, we have seen above that under the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] [[chain complexes]] yield examples of spectra. But the [[tensor product of chain complexes]] is graded commutative.

Second, more fundamentally, we see in the discussion of the [[Brown representability theorem]] ([here](#BrownRepresentabilityTheorem)) that every ([[sequential spectrum|sequential]]) [[spectrum]] $A$ induces a [[generalized homology theory]] given by the formula $X \mapsto \pi_\bullet(E \wedge X)$ (where the smash product is just the degreewise smash of pointed objects). By the [[suspension isomorphism]] this is such that for $X = S^n$ the [[n-sphere]], then $\pi_{\bullet\geq 0}(E \wedge S^n) \simeq \pi_{\bullet \geq 0}(E_n)$. This means that instead of thinking of a [[sequential spectrum]], def. \ref{SequentialSpectrum}, as indexed on the [[natural numbers]] equipped with [[addition]] $(\mathbb{N},+)$, it may be more natural to think of sequential spectra as indexed on the [[n-spheres]] equipped with their smash product of pointed spaces $(\{S^n\}_n, \wedge)$. 


+-- {: .num_prop #GradedCommutativityOfSmashOfSpheres}
###### Proposition

There are [[homeomorphisms]] between [[n-spheres]] and their [[smash products]]

$$

  \;\colon\;
  S^{n_1} \wedge S^{n_2}
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}

$$

such that in [[Ho(Top)]] there are [[commuting diagrams]] like so:

where here $(-1)^n \colon S^n \to S^n$ denotes the homotopy class of a [[continuous function]] of [[degree of a continuous function|degree]] $(-1)^n \in \mathbb{Z} \simeq [S^n, S^n]$.


=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

With the [[n-sphere]] $S^n$ realized as the [[one-point compactification]] of the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$, then $\phi_{n_1,n_2}$ is given by the identity on [[coordinates]] and the [[braiding]] homeomorphism

$$
  b_{n_1,n_2}
  \;\colon\;
  S^{n_1} \wedge S^{S^2}
  \stackrel{\sigma}{\longrightarrow}
  S^{n_2} \wedge S^{n_2}
$$

is given by permuting the [[coordinates]]:

$$
  (x_1, \cdots, x_{n_1}, y_1, \cdots, y_{n_2})
  \mapsto
  (y_1, \cdots, y_{n_2}, x_1, \cdots, x_{n_1})
  \,.
$$

This has [[degree of a continuous map|degree]] $(-1)^{n_1 n_2}$ .

=--


This phenomenon suggests that if we "[[categorify]]" the [[natural numbers]] to the [[n-spheres]] and think of the $n$th component space of a [[sequential spectrum]] as being the value assigned to the [[n-sphere]]

$$
  E_n \simeq E(S^n)
$$

then there should be a possibly non-trivial [[action]] of the [[symmetric group]] $\Sigma_n$ on $E_n$, due to the fact that there is such an action of $S^n$ which is non-trivial according to prop. \ref{GradedCommutativityOfSmashOfSpheres}.

We discuss two ways of making this precise below in  _[Symmetric and orthogonal spectra](#SymmetricSpectra)_, and we discuss how these are unified by a concept of [[module objects]] over a [[monoid object]] representing the [[sphere spectrum]] below in _[S-modules](#SModules)_.

The general abstract theory for handling this is _[[monoidal category|monoidal]] and [[enriched category theory]]_. We first develop the relevant basics in _[Monoidal and enriched categories](#MonoidalAndEnrichedCategories)_


#### Symmetric and orthogonal spectra
 {#SymmetricSpectra}

**Literature.** ([Schwede 12](#Schwede12)) 

$\,$

In order to accomodate the graded commutativity phenomenon of spheres in prop. \ref{GradedCommutativityOfSmashOfSpheres}, we enrich the model of [[stable homotopy theory]] based on [[sequential spectra]], def. \ref{SequentialSpectrum}, by adding in [[mathematical structure|structure]] which captures the fact that the $n$th component $X_n$ of a sequential spectrum $X$ is to be thought of as the evaluation on the [[n-sphere]] and thus ought to be [[action|acted]] on by the [[automorphisms]] of the $n$-sphere. 

Taking into account just the automorphisms by [[coordinate]] [[permutations]] on $S^n \simeq (S^1)^{\wedge^n}$ yields the concept of _[[symmetric spectra]]_.
Taking into account the automorphisms by [[orthogonal group|orthogonal transformations]] on $S^n \simeq (\mathbb{R}^n)^+$ yields the concept of _[[orthogonal spectra]]_. Using _all_ automorphisms yields the concept of _pre-[[excisive functors]]_.

To contrast these more structured models for spectra with the plain [[sequential spectra]], they are sometimes referred to as _[[highly structured spectra]]_.

Below in _[S-modules](#SModules)_ we give a unified discussion of all four models of spectra thus obtained (sequential, symmetric, orthogonal, excisive). Further below in _[The stable model structures](#TheStableModelStructures)_ we use this to construction and understand the [[model structures on spectra]] that present [[stable homotopy theory]].

###### Definition

Define the following $Top^{\ast/}$-[[enriched categories|enriched]] [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]] [[closed monoidal categories]] (the [[tensor product]] is an [[enriched functor]]):

1. $Seq$ has as objects the [[natural numbers]] and has only identity morphisms, tensor product is the addition of natural numbers, tensor unit is 0;

1. $Sym$ is the standard [[skeletal category|skeleton]] of the [[core]] of [[FinSet]], objects are the sets $\{1, \cdots,n\}$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, all morphisms are [[automorphisms]] and the [[automorphism group]] of $\{1,\cdots,n\}$ is the [[symmetric group]] $\Sigma_n$, tensor product is the [[disjoint union]] of sets, tensor unit is the [[empty set]];

1. $Orth$ has as objects finite dimenional real linear [[inner product spaces]] $(V, \langle -,-\rangle)$ and as morphisms the [[linear map|linear]] [[isometry|isometric]] [[isomorphisms]] between these; hence all morphisms are [[automorphisms]] and the [[automorphism group]] of the object $(V, \langle -,-\rangle)$ is the [[orthogonal group]] $O(V)$; the monoidal product is [[direct sum]] of linear spaces, the tensor unit is the 0-vector space;

1. $Top_{fin}^{\ast/}$ is the [[full subcategory]] of [[pointed topological space]] on those [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to [[finite CW-complexes]], tensor product is their [[smash product]], tensor unit is the [[0-sphere]] $S^0$.

Denote the canonical [[faithful functor|faithful]] [[subcategory]] inclusions by

$$
 \array{
   Seq 
     &\stackrel{seq}{\hookrightarrow}& 
   Sym 
    &\stackrel{sym}{\hookrightarrow}&

where $S^V$ denotes the [[one-point compactification]] of $V$. On morphisms $sym \colon \Sigma_n \hookrightarrow O(n)$ is the inclusion of [[permutation]] matrices into [[orthogonal group|orthogonal]] matrices and $orth \colon O(V) \hookrightarrow Aut(S^V)$ is the topological subspace inclusions of the pointed [[homeomorphisms]] $S^V \to S^V$ that are induced under forming [[one-point compactification]] from linear isometric isometries of $V$.

The sequence of inclusions in def. \ref{TopologicalDiagramCategoriesForSpectra} satisfies the following properties:

1. All three inclusions are [[strong monoidal functors]].

1. Under passing to [[enriched functor categories]], restriction $(-)^\ast$ along these inclusions and [[left Kan extension]] $(-)_!$ along them yields a sequence of [[adjunctions]]

1. All four [[enriched functor categories]] become [[symmetric monoidal categories]] with the [[Day convolution]] monoidal product structure induced by the monoidal structure of their [[sites]]. 

1. With respect to this all [[adjunctions]] above are symmetric [[monoidal adjunctions]] (the [[right adjoint]] is a [[symmetric monoidal functor|symmetric]] [[lax monoidal functor]], the [[left adjoint]] is even a [[symmetric monoidal functor|symmetric]] [[strong monoidal functor]]).

Since this is going to be the standard presentation of the [[sphere spectrum]] in the [[model structure for excisive functors]] on $[Top_{fin}^{\ast/}, Top^{\ast/}]$ we refer to it as _[[generalized the|the]] [[sphere spectrum]]_.

+-- {: .num_remark #RestrictionsOfSphereSpectrumAreStillMonoidObjects}
###### Remark

While $\mathbb{S}$ in def. \ref{StandardRepresentativeOfTheSphereSpectrum} is the [[tensor unit]] in $([Top_{fin}^{\ast/}, Top^{\ast/}], \otimes_{Day})$, neither of its restrictions $\mathbb{S}_{Orth},\mathbb{S}_{Sym}, \mathbb{S}_{Seq}$ is the tensor unit in $([Orth, Top^{\ast/}],\otimes_{Day}), ([Sym, Top^{\ast/}],\otimes_{Day}), ([Seq, Top^{\ast/}],\otimes_{Day})$, respectively. 

Nevertheless, because by prop. \ref{PropertiesOfTopologicalDiagramCategoriesForSpectra} the restriction functors are [[strong monoidal functors]] and because the tensor unit $\mathbb{S}$ canonically has the structure of a [[monoid object]], each of $\mathbb{S}_{Orth},\mathbb{S}_{Sym}, \mathbb{S}_{Seq}$ inherts the structure of a [[monoid object]] in the respective [[Day convolution]] [[monoidal category]].

Moreover, $\mathbb{S}_{Orth}$ and $\mathbb{S}_{Sym}$ are [[commutative monoid objects]], while $\mathbb{S}_{Seq}$ is not commutative (due to the [graded commutativity in the smash product of spheres](smash+product+of+spectra#GradedCommutativity) which is not reflected in the trivial symmetry of the tensor product on $Seq$).

| | $\mathbb{S}$ | $\mathbb{S}_{Orth}$ | $\mathbb{S}_{Sym}$ | $\mathbb{S}_{Seq}$ |

| [[monoid object]] | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| [[commutative monoid object]] | yes | yes | yes | no |
| [[tensor unit]] | yes | no | no | no |

Explicitly, by the discussion at _[Day convolutions -- Properties -- Monoids](Day+convolution#Monoids)_, monoids with resepct to Day convolution are equivalently [[lax monoidal functors]] on the site, and as such $\mathbb{S}_{Orth}$ is the one given by the canonical [[natural transformations]]

$$
  S^{V_1} \wedge S^{V_2} \longrightarrow S^{V_1 \oplus V_2}
$$

and $\mathbb{S}_{Sym}$ and $\mathbb{S}_{Seq}$ the ones given by the canonical natural transformations

###### Proposition

The category of right [[module objects]] over $\mathbb{S}_{Orth}$, $\mathbb{S}_{Sym}$ and $\mathbb{S}_{Seq}$ from def. \ref{StandardRepresentativeOfTheSphereSpectrum}, which are [[monoid objects]] by prop. \ref{PropertiesOfTopologicalDiagramCategoriesForSpectra}, remark \ref{RestrictionsOfSphereSpectrumAreStillMonoidObjects}, are [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]], respectively, to the categories of [[orthogonal spectra]], [[symmetric spectra]] and [[sequential spectra]] (in [[compactly generated topological spaces]]):

$$

$$
  \mathbb{S}_{Seq} Mod_r \simeq SeqSpec(Top)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Write $\mathbb{S}_{dia}$ for any of the three monoids. By the discussion at _[Day convolutions -- Properties -- Monoids](Day+convolution#Monoids)_, right modules with respect to [[Day convolution]] are equivalently right [[modules over monoidal functors]] over the monoidal functor corresponding to $\mathbb{S}_{dia}$ as in remark \ref{RestrictionsOfSphereSpectrumAreStillMonoidObjects}. This means that for $\mathbb{S}_{Sym}$ and $\mathbb{S}_{Seq}$ they are functors $X \colon Sym \longrightarrow sSet^{\ast/}$ or $X \colon Seq \longrightarrow sSet^{\ast/}$, respectively equipped with [[natural transformations]]

$$
  X_p \wedge S^{q}  \longrightarrow X_{p+q}
$$

satisfying the evident [[categorification|categorified]] [[action]] property. In the present case this action property says that these morphisms are determined by 

$$
  X_p \wedge S^1 \longrightarrow X_{p+1}
$$

under the isomorphisms $S^p \simeq S^1 \wedge S^{p-1}$. Naturality of all these morphisms as functors on $Sym$ is the equivariance under the symmetric group actions in the definition of [[symmetric spectra]]. 

Similarly, modules over $\mathbb{S}_{Orth}$ are equivalently functors

$$
  X_V \wedge S^{W}  \longrightarrow X_{V \oplus W}
$$

etc. and their functoriality embodies the [[orthogonal group]]-equivariance in the definition of [[orthogonal spectra]].


=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

For completeness we may trivially add to the three statements in prop. \ref{HighlyStructuredSpectraAsDayConvolutionSModules} the equivalence

$$
  \mathbb{S} Mod_r \simeq [Top^{\ast/}_{fin}, Top^{\ast/}]
  \,,
$$

which holds tautologically because by def. \ref{StandardRepresentativeOfTheSphereSpectrum} $\mathbb{S}$ is in fact the [[tensor unit]] in $([Top^{\ast/}_{fin}, Top^{\ast/}],\otimes_{Day})$, so that every object here is canonically a module object over $\mathbb{S}$.

Now the [[model structure on excisive functors]] shows that the category $[Top^{\ast/}_{fin}, Top^{\ast/}]$ constitutes a model for [[stable homotopy theory]], while this is not the case for either of its restrictions. 

Hence we may read prop. \ref{HighlyStructuredSpectraAsDayConvolutionSModules} as saying that while restricting the domain of [[excisive functors]] breaks their property of being a model for [[stable homotopy theory]], but at the same time retaining the correspondingly restricted [[sphere spectrum]]-[[module]] structure first of all becomes non-tautological after restriction and second restores the property of the objects to model spectra.

Via prop. \ref{HighlyStructuredSpectraAsDayConvolutionSModules} this is equivalently symmetric monoidal product structure

1. If $\mathbb{S}_{dia}$ is a [[commutative monoid]] (hence for $dia \in \{Top^\ast/, Orth,Sym\}$ but not for $dia = Seq$) then $\mathbb{S}_{dia} FreeMod^{op}$ carries a [[symmetric monoidal category]] structure such that under the above equivalence its [[Day convolution]] is the [[tensor product of modules]].

1. There is a $Top^{\ast/}$-[[enriched functor]]

The following proposition says that def. \ref{StableEquivalencesForDiagramSpectra} makes sense, in that if the [[Bousfield localization of model categories|left Bousfield localization]] of the strict model structures at the stable equivalences exists (which we check [below](ProofOfTheStableModelStructure)) then it indeed localizes the homotopy theory to the [[Omega-spectra]].

+-- {: .num_prop #StableEquivalencesBetweenOmegaSpectraAreStrictWeakEquivalences}
###### Proposition

The weak equivalences in the strict model structure (prop. \ref{StrictModelStructureOnDiagramSpectra}) and the stable equivalences of def. \ref{StableEquivalencesForDiagramSpectra} are related as follows:

1. Every weak equivalence with respect to the strict model structure is a stable equivalence.

1. Every stable equivalence between Omega-spectra (def. \ref{StableEquivalencesForDiagramSpectra}) is a weak equivalence in the strict model structure.

=--

([MMSS 00, lemma 8.11](#MMSS00))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The first statement follows by def. \ref{StableEquivalencesForDiagramSpectra} since weak equivalences become isomorphisms in the [[homotopy category]].

For the second statement, let $f \colon X \to Y$ be a stable equivalence between Omega-spectra. Then by definition, in particular

$$
  [f,X]_{strict} \;\colon\; [Y,X]_{strict} \longrightarrow [X,X]_{strict}
$$

is a [[bijection]]. Therefore the pre-image of $[id_X] \in [X,X]_{strict}$ is an inverse to $f$ in the [[homotopy category]] of the strict model structure. Hence $f$ represents an isomorphism in the strict homotopy category and is hence a weak equivalence in the strict model structure.

#### Free spectra
 {#FreeSpectra}

> This is a technical section with discussion of certain [[free construction|free]] objects  in the categories of spectra of prop. \ref{HighlyStructuredSpectraAsDayConvolutionSModules}. This discussion is used in the proof of the stable model structures [below](#ProofOfTheStableModelStructure) and of the Quillen equivalences between them [further below](#QuillenEquivalencesOfStableModelStructures).

The concept of _[[free spectrum]]_ is a generalization of that of _[[suspension spectrum]]_. In fact the [[stable homotopy types]] of free spectra are precisely those of iterated [[loop space objects]] of [[suspension spectra]]. But for the development of the theory what matters is free spectra before passing to stable homotopy types, for as such they play the role of the basic cells for the stable [[model structures on spectra]] analogous to the role of the [[n-spheres]] in the [[classical model structure on topological spaces]] (def. \ref{GeneratingAndGeneratingAcyclicCofibrationsForDiagramSpectra} below).

Moreover, while free [[sequential spectra]] are just re-indexed [[suspension spectra]], free [[symmetric spectra]] and free [[orthogonal spectra]] in addition come with suitably freely generated [[actions]] of the [[symmetric group]] and the [[orthogonal group]]. It turns out that this is not entirely trivial; it leads to a subtle issue (lemma \ref{AdjunctsOfFreeSpectrumInclusionsAreOrAreNotStableWeakHomotopyEquivalences} below) where the [[adjuncts]] of certain canonical inclusions of free spectra are [[stable weak homotopy equivalences]] for sequential and orthogonal spectra, but _not_ for symmetric spectra.  The fine analysis of this phenomenon is crucial in the proof of the [[Quillen equivalences]] between the stable model structures on the four models of spectra (theorem \ref{QuillenEquivalencesBetweenStableModelStructuresOnDiagramSpectra}).

1. On the free $\mathbb{S}_{dia}$-module on $e \in Dia^{op} \stackrel{y}{\hookrightarrow} [Dia, Top^{\ast/}]$ this takes the value

  $$

=--

([MMSS00, p. 7 with theorem 2.2](#MMSS00))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Generally, for $\mathcal{C}$ a $V$-[[enriched category|enriched]] [[symmetric monoidal category]], and for $c\in \mathcal{C}$ an object, then there is an [[adjunction]]

$$
  [\mathcal{C}, V]
    \stackrel{\overset{y(d)\otimes(-)}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{(-)_c}{\longrightarrow}}
  V
$$

whose characterizing [[natural isomorphism]] is the combination of that of [[tensoring]] with the [[Yoneda embedding]]:

$$
  [\mathcal{C},V]( y(d) \otimes K, F )
    \simeq
  V( K, [\mathcal{C},V]( y(d), F ) )
    \simeq
  V(K, F(d))
  \,.
$$ 

Specializing this to our case with $V = Top^{\ast/}$ and $\mathcal{C} = \mathbb{S}_{dia} FreeMod^{op}$ yields the first statement. The second follows from similar yoga, see the formula at _[Day convolution -- Modules](Day+convolution#FreeModulesOverAMonoidInDayConvolution)_.

+-- {: .num_prop #ExplicitFormOfFreeSpectra}
###### Proposition

Explicitly, the [[free spectra]] according to def. \ref{FreeStructuredSpectrum}, look as follows:

For [[sequential spectra]]: $(F^{Seq}_n K)_q \simeq K \wedge S^{q-n}$;

for [[symmetric spectra]]: $(F^{Sym}_n K)_q \simeq \Sigma(q)_+ \wedge_{\Sigma(q-n)} K \wedge S^{q-n}$.

for [[orthogonal spectra]]: $(F^{Orth}_n K)_q \simeq O(q)_+ \wedge_{O(q-n)} K \wedge S^{q-n}$.

In particular: 

1. $F_0 K = \Sigma^\infty K$;

1. $F_n^{Seq}S^n$ is like the [[suspension spectrum]] of the point (the standard sequential [[sphere spectrum]]) but with its first $n$ components simply removed.


=--

(e.g. [Schwede 12, example 3.20](#Schwede12))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By working out the formula in item 2 of lemma \ref{ExplicitExpressionForFreeSpectra}. In the sequential case $(Dia = Seq)$ there exists a morphism $k_1 \otimes k_2 \to k_3$ only if $k_1 + k_2 = k_3$ and then there is a unique such. Hence here the colimit in the formula becomes a [[coproduct]] and we find

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    (F^{Seq}_n K)(q)
      & \simeq
    \underset{e_1+e_2 = q}{\coprod} 
    \underset{\simeq\left\{ \array{S^0 & if\, n = e_1 \\ \ast & otherwise}\right.}{\underbrace{Seq(n,e_1)}} \wedge \mathbb{S}_{dia}(e_2) \wedge K
    \\
     & \simeq
      S^{q-n}\wedge K
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

In the symmetric case ($Dia = Sym$) the formula is similar except that $S^0 = Seq(q,q)_+$ is replaced by $Sym(q,q)_+ = \Sigma(q)_+$ and the colimit goes over the automorphisms that fix $q-n$ elements, thereby producing the partial smash tensor shown in the statement. Analogously for the orthogonal case ($Dia = Orth$).

=--

One use of free spectra, important in the verification of the stable model structures [below](#ProofOfTheStableModelStructure) and in the dicussion of the stable equivalences [further below](#RelatingStableEquivalencesAndStableWeakHomotopyEquivalences), is that they serve to co-represent adjuncts of structure morphisms of spectra. To this end, first consider the following general existence statement.

+-- {: .num_lemma #CorepresentingOfAdjunctsOfStructureMapsExists}
###### Lemma

For each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ there exists a morphism

$$
  \lambda_n
    \;\colon\;
  F_{n+1}^{dia}S^1
    \longrightarrow
  F_n^{dia} S^0
$$

such that for every $X\in \mathbb{S}_{dia} Mod$ precomposition $\lambda_n^\ast$ forms a [[commuting diagram]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    \mathbb{S}_{dia}Mod(F^{dia}_n S^0, X) &\simeq& Top^{\ast/}(S^0,X_n) &\simeq& X_n

    &\simeq&
    Top^{\ast/}(S^1, X_{n+1})
    &\simeq&
    \Omega X_{n+1}
  }
  \,,
$$

where the horizontal equivalences are the [[adjunction]] isomorphisms and the canonical identification, and where the right morphism is the $(\Sigma \dashv \Omega)$-[[adjunct]] of the structure map $\sigma_n$ of the [[sequential spectrum]] $seq^\ast X$ underlying $X$ (def. \ref{NotationForGenericDiagramSpectra}).

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Since all prescribed morphisms in the diagram are [[natural transformations]], this is in fact a diagram of copreheaves on $\mathbb{S}_{dia} Mod$

$$
  \array{
    \mathbb{S}_{dia}Mod(F^{dia}_n S^0, -) &\simeq& Top^{\ast/}(S^0,(-)_n) &\simeq& (-)_n

    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{}}
    && &&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\tilde \sigma^{(-)}_n}}

    \mathbb{S}_{dia}Mod(F^{dia}_{n+1} S^1, -)
    &\simeq&
    Top^{\ast/}(S^1, (-)_{n+1})
    &\simeq&
    \Omega (-)_{n+1}

With this the statement follows by the [[Yoneda lemma]].

=--

([MMSS 00, lemma 8.5](#MMSS00), following [Hovey-Shipley-Smith 00, remark 2.2.12](#HoveyShipleySmith00))


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Consider the case $Dia = Seq$ and $n = 0$. All other cases work analogously.

By lemma \ref{ExplicitFormOfFreeSpectra}, in this case the morphism $\lambda_0$ has components like so:

$$
  \array{
    \vdots && \vdots
    \\
    S^3 &\stackrel{id}{\longrightarrow}& S^3
    \\
    S^2 &\stackrel{id}{\longrightarrow}& S^2
    \\
    S^1 &\stackrel{id}{\longrightarrow}& S^1
    \\
    \ast &\stackrel{0}{\longrightarrow}& S^0
    \\
    \underbrace{\,\,\,} && \underbrace{\,\,\,}
    \\
    F_1 S^1 &\stackrel{\lambda_0}{\longrightarrow}& F_0 S^0
  }
  \,.
$$

Now for $X$ any sequential spectrum, then a morphism $f \colon F_0 S^0 \to X$ is uniquely determined by its 0th components $f_0 \colon S^0 \to X_0$ (that's of course the very free property of $F_0 S^0$); as the compatibility with the structure maps forces the first component, in particular, to be $\sigma_0^X\circ \Sigma f$:

$$
  \array{
    \Sigma S^0 &\stackrel{\Sigma f}{\longrightarrow}& \Sigma X_0
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\sigma_0^X}}
    \\
    S^1 &\stackrel{\sigma_0^X \circ \Sigma f}{\longrightarrow}& X_1
  }
$$

But that first component is just the component that similarly determines the precompositon of $f$ with $\lambda_0$, hence $\lambda_0^\ast f$ is fully fixed as being the map $\sigma_0^X \circ \Sigma f$. Therefore $\lambda_0^\ast$ is the function

$$
  \lambda_0^\ast
  \;\colon\;
  X_0 
  = 
  Maps(S^0, X_0)
  \stackrel{f \mapsto \sigma_0^X \circ \Sigma f}{\longrightarrow}
  \Maps(S^1, X_1)
  =
  \Omega X_1
  \,.
$$

It remains to see that this is the $(\Sigma \dashv \Omega)$-[[adjunct]] of $\sigma_0^X$. By the general formula for adjuncts, this is

$$
  \tilde \sigma_0^X 
    \;\colon\; 
  X_0 
     \stackrel{\eta}{\longrightarrow} 
  \Omega \Sigma X_0
     \stackrel{\Omega \sigma_0^X}{\longrightarrow}
  \Omega X_1
  \,.
$$

To compare to the above, we check what this does on points: $S^0 \stackrel{f_0}{\longrightarrow} X_0$ is sent to the composite

$$
   S^0 
     \stackrel{f_0}{\longrightarrow}
   X_0 
     \stackrel{\eta}{\longrightarrow} 
   \Omega \Sigma X_0
     \stackrel{\Omega \sigma_0^X}{\longrightarrow}
   \Omega X_1
   \,.
$$

To identify this as a map $S^1 \to X_1$ we use the adjunction isomorphism once more to throw all the $\Omega$-s on the right back to $\Sigma$-s the left, to finally find that this is indeed

$$
  \sigma_0^X \circ \Sigma f
    \;\colon\;
  S^1 = \Sigma S^0 \stackrel{\Sigma f}{\longrightarrow} \Sigma X_0 \stackrel{\sigma_0^X}{\longrightarrow} X_1
  \,.
$$

The following property of the maps from def. \ref{CorepresentationOfAdjunctsOfStructureMaps} to be or not to be stable weak homotopy equivalences will be the key technical fact that implies ([below](#RelatingStableEquivalencesAndStableWeakHomotopyEquivalences)) that stable equivalences of spectra are or are not the same as stable weak homotopy equivalences.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The first statement is an immediate consequence of lemma \ref{IndeedCorepresentationOfAdjunctsOfStructureMaps}.

The other two statements follow from inspection of the explicit form of the maps, via prop. \ref{ExplicitFormOfFreeSpectra}, in each case separately:

**sequential case**

Here the components of the morphism eventually stabilize to isomorphisms

$$
  \array{
    & \vdots && \vdots
    \\
    (\lambda_n)_{n+3} & S^3 &\stackrel{id}{\longrightarrow}& S^3
    \\
    (\lambda_n)_{n+2} & S^2 &\stackrel{id}{\longrightarrow}& S^2
    \\
    (\lambda_n)_{n+1} & S^1 &\stackrel{id}{\longrightarrow}& S^1
    \\
    (\lambda_n)_n \colon & \ast &\stackrel{0}{\longrightarrow}& S^0
    \\
    & \ast &\longrightarrow& \ast
    \\
    & \vdots && \vdots
    \\
    & \ast &\longrightarrow& \ast
    \\
    & \underbrace{\,\,\,} && \underbrace{\,\,\,}
    \\
    \lambda_n \colon & F_{n+1} S^1 &\stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}& F_n S^0
  }
$$

and this immediately gives that $\lambda_n$ is an isomorphism on stable homotopy groups.

**orthogonal case**

Here for $q \geq n+1$ the $q$-component of $\lambda_n$ is the [[quotient]] map

$$
  (\lambda_n)_q 
    \;\colon\;
  O(q)_+ \wedge_{O(q-n-1)} S^{q-n}
   \simeq
  O(q)_+ \wedge_{O(q-n-1)} S^1 \wedge S^{q-n-1}
  \longrightarrow
  O(q)_+ \wedge_{O(q-n)}S^{q-n}
  \,.
$$

By the [suspension isomorphism](homotopy+group+of+a+spectrum#SuspensionIsomorphismOfStableHomotopyGroups) for [[stable homotopy groups]], $\lambda_n$ is a stable weak homotopy equivalence precisely if any of its [[reduced suspension|suspensions]] is. Hence consider instead $\Sigma^n \lambda_n \coloneqq S^n \wedge \lambda_n$, whose $q$-component is 

$$
  (\Sigma^n\lambda_n)_q 
    \;\colon\;
  O(q)_+ \wedge_{O(q-n-1)} S^{q}
    \longrightarrow
  O(q)_+ \wedge_{O(q-n)}S^{q}
  \,.
$$

Now due to the fact that $O(q-k)$-action on $S^q$ lifts to an $O(q)$-action, the quotients of the diagonal action of $O(q-k)$ equivalently become quotients of just the left action. Formally this is due to the existence of the [[commuting diagram]]

$$
  \array{
    O(q)_+ \wedge S^q 
     &\stackrel{id}{\longrightarrow}& 
    O(q)_+ \wedge S^q 
     &\stackrel{id}{\longrightarrow}& 
    O(q)_+ \wedge S^q 
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p_2}}
    \\
    Q(q)_+ \wedge_{Q(q-k)} S^q 
     &\longrightarrow&
    Q(q)_+ \wedge_{Q(q)} S^q
    & \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} & S^q
  }
$$

which says that the image of any $(g,s) \in O(q)_+  \wedge S^q$ in the quotient $Q(q)_+ \wedge_{Q(q-k)} S^q$ is labeled by $([g],s)$.

It follows that $(\Sigma^n\lambda_n)_q$ is the smash product of a projection map of [[coset]] spaces with the identity on the sphere:

$$
  (\Sigma^n\lambda_n)_q 
    \simeq
  proj_+ \wedge id_{S^q} 
    \;\colon\;
  O(q)/O(q-n-1)_+ \wedge S^q
    \longrightarrow
  O(q)/O(q-n)_+ \wedge S^{q}
  \,.
$$

Now finally observe that this projection function

$$
  proj
  \;\colon\;
  O(q)/O(q-n-1) 
    \longrightarrow
  O(q)/O(q-n)
$$

is $(q - n -1 )$-connected (see [here](homogeneous+space#CofiberSequencesOfCosetsOfOrthogonalGroups)). Hence its smash product with $S^q$ is $(2q - n -1 )$-connected.

The key here is the fast growth of the connectivity with $q$. This implies that for each $s$ there exists $q$ such that $\pi_{s+q}((\Sigma^n \lambda_n)_q)$ becomes an isomorphism. Hence $\Sigma^n \lambda_n$ is a stable weak homotopy equivalence and therefore so is $\lambda_n$.

**symmetric case**
 
Here the morphism $\lambda_n$ has the same form as in the orthogonal case above, except that all occurences of [[orthogonal groups]] are replaced by just their sub-[[symmetric groups]].

Accordingly, the analysis then proceeds entirely analogously, with the key difference that the projection

$$
  \Sigma(q)/\Sigma(q-n-1) 
    \longrightarrow
  \Sigma(q)/\Sigma(q-n)
$$

does _not_ become highly connected as $q$ increases, due to the [[discrete topological space]] underlying the symmetric group. Accordingly the conclusion now is the opposite: $\lambda_n$ is not a stable weak homotopy equivalence in this case.

###### Lemma

Every element in $K$ (def. \ref{GeneratingAndGeneratingAcyclicCofibrationsForDiagramSpectra}) is both:

1. a cofibration with respect to the strict model structure (prop. \ref{StrictModelStructureOnDiagramSpectra});

1. a stable equivalence (def. \ref{StableEquivalencesForDiagramSpectra}).

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof 

First regarding strict cofibrations: By the [[Yoneda lemma]], the elements in $F J$ have [[right lifting property]] against the strict fibrations, hence in particular they are strict cofibrations. Moreover, by [[Joyal-Tierney calculus]], $k_n \Box i_+$ has left lifting against any acyclic strict fibration $f$ precisely if $k_n$ has left lifting against $f^i$. By $\mathbb{S}_{dia} Mod_{strict}$ being a $Top$-[[enriched model category]] the latter is still a strict acyclic fibration. Since $k_n$ by construction is a strict cofibration, the lifting follows and hence also $k_n \Box i_+$ is a strict cofibration.

Regarding stable equivalences: The morphisms in $F J$ by design are strict weak equivalences, hence they are in particular stable equivalences. Similarly, the morphisms $k_n$ by construction, by [[two-out-of-three]] and by remark \ref{CorepresentingForAdjunctOfStructureMapsAreStableEquivalences} are stable equivalences. Hence the derived hom (...expand...) out of $k_n \Box i_+$ is the homotopy pullback of a weak equivalence, hence is a weak equivalence, hence on the homotopy category an iso.

A morphism $f \colon X \to Y$ in $\mathbb{S}_{dia} Mod$ is a $K$-[[injective morphism]] (for $K$ from def. \ref{GeneratingAndGeneratingAcyclicCofibrationsForDiagramSpectra}) precisely if 

1. it is fibration in the strict model structure (hence degreewise a fibration)

###### Proof

Lifting against $F J$ alone characterizes strict fibrations, hence degreewise fibrations. Lifting against the remaining [[pushout product]] morphism $k_n \Box i_+$ is, by [[Joyal-Tierney calculus]], equivalent to left lifting $i_+$ against the dual pullback product of $f^{k_n}$, which means that $f^{k_n}$ is a weak homotopy equivalence.

A morphism in $\mathbb{S}_{dia}Mod$ which is both

1. a $K$-[[injective morphisms]] (with respect to $K$ from def. \ref{GeneratingAndGeneratingAcyclicCofibrationsForDiagramSpectra}) 

is an acyclic fibration in the stric model structure, prop. \ref{StrictModelStructureOnDiagramSpectra}, hence is degreewise a [[weak homotopy equivalence]] and [[Serre fibration]] of topological spaces;

=--

([MMSS 00, corollary 9.8](#MMSS00))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let $f\colon E \to B$ be both a stable equivalence as well as a $K$-injective morphism. Since $K$ contains the generating acyclic cofibrations for the strict model structure (prop. \ref{StrictModelStructureOnDiagramSpectra}), $f$ is in particular a strict fibration, hence a degreewise fibration. Therefore the fiber $F$ of $f$ is its [[homotopy fiber]] in the strict model structure. This implies that for any $E$ that with $[f,E]_{strict}$ a bijection, by assumption also $[\ast,E]_{strict} \to [F,E]_{strict}$ is a bijection, hence that $F\to \ast$ is also a stable weak equivalence. 

Observe also that $F$, being the pullback of a $K$-injective morphisms is a $K$-[[injective object]], so that by corollary \ref{KInjectivesObjectsAreOmegaSpectra} $F$ is an Omega-spectrum. Together this implies with prop. \ref{StableEquivalencesBetweenOmegaSpectraAreStrictWeakEquivalences} that $F \to \ast$ is a weak equivalence in the strict model structure, hence degreewise a [[weak homotopy equivalence]]. From this the [[long exact sequence of homotopy groups]] imply that $\pi_{\bullet \geq 1}(f_n)$ is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]] for all $n$ and for each homotopy group in positive degree. 

To infer from this the remaining case that also $\pi_0(f_0)$ is an isomorphism, observe that by assumption of $K$-injectivity lemma \ref{KInjectivesAreAcyclicCofibrations} gives that $f_n$ is a homotopy pullback (in topological spaces) of $\Omega (f_{n+1})$. But by the above $\Omega (f_{n+1})$ is a weak homotopy equivalence, since $\pi_\bullet(\Omega(-)) = \pi_{\bullet+1}(-)$. Therefore $f_n$ is the homotopy pullback of a weak homotopy equivalence and hence itself a weak homotopy equivalence.

For $K$ from def. \ref{GeneratingAndGeneratingAcyclicCofibrationsForDiagramSpectra}  the [[retracts]] of $K$-[[relative cell complexes]] are precisely the morphisms which are

([MMSS 00, prop. 9.9 (i)](#MMSS00))


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Since all elements of $K$ are stable equivalences and strict cofibrations by lemma \ref{ElementsOfKAreStableEquivalencesAndStrictCofibrations}, it follows that every retract of relative $K$-cell complex has the same property.

In the other direction, if $f$ is a stable equivalence and strict cofibration, by the [[small object argument]] it factors $f \colon \stackrel{i}{\to}\stackrel{p}{\to}$ as a relative $K$-cell complex $i$ followed by a $K$-[[injective morphism]] $p$. By the previous statement $i$ is a stable equivalence, and so by assumption and by [[two-out-of-three]] so is $p$. Therefore lemma \ref{KInjectiveStableEquivalencesAreStrictEquivalences} implies that $p$ is a strict acyclic fibration. But then the assumption that $f$ is a strict cofibration mean that it has the [[left lifting property]] against $p$, and so the [[retract argument]] implies that $f$ is a retract of the relative $K$-cell complex $i$.

Conversely, a morphism injective with respect to stricts cofibrations that are stable equivalences is a $K$-[[injective morphism]] by corollary \ref{KInjectivesAreIndeedTheStableFibrations}, and hence if it is also a stable equivalence then by lemma \ref{KInjectiveStableEquivalencesAreStrictEquivalences} it is a strict acylic fibration.

+-- {: .proof #StableModelStructureOnDiagramSpectraProof}
###### Proof
(of theorem \ref{StableModelStructuresOnDiagramSpectra})

The non-trivial points to check are the two [[weak factorization systems]].

That $(cof_{stable}\cap weq_{stable} \;,\; fib_{stable})$ is a weak factorization system follows from lemma \ref{RetractsOfRelativeKCellComplexesAreTheStableEquivalencesAndStrictCofibrations} and the [[small object argument]]. 

By lemma \ref{StableAcyclicFibrationsAreEquivalentlyStrictAcyclicFibrations} the stable acyclic fibrations are equivalently the strict acyclic fibrations and hence the weak factorization system $(cof_{stable} \;,\; fib_{stable} \cap we_{stable})$ is identified with that of the strict model structure $(cof_{strict} \;,\; fib_{strict} \cap we_{strict})$.

#### Stable equivalences

Here we discuss that the two concepts of _stable equivalences_ and of _stable weak homotopy equivalences_ in def. \ref{StableEquivalencesForDiagramSpectra} actually agree in the cases of a) pre-[[excisive functors]], b) [[orthogonal spectra]] and c) [[sequential spectra]], while in the case of [[symmetric spectra]] the class of stable equivalences includes but is strictly larger than that of stable weak homotopy equivalences:

+-- {: .num_theorem #RelationBetweenStableEquivalencesAndStableWeakHomotopyEquivalencesForDiagramSpectra}
###### Theorem

In $\mathbb{S}Mod$, $\mathbb{S}_{Orth} Mod$ and in $\mathbb{S}_{Seq} Mod$ we have for the concepts from def. \ref{StableEquivalencesForDiagramSpectra} that

$$
  stable\;weak\;homotopy\;equivalence 
  \;\Leftrightarrow\;
  stable \; equivalence
  \,.
$$

In $\mathbb{S}_{Sym}Mod$ however we only have

$$
  stable\;weak\;homotopy\;equivalence 
  \;\Rightarrow\;
  stable \; equivalence
$$

but the reverse implication is false.

=--

([MMSS00, prop. 8.7, prop. 8.8](#MMSS00))


This is important in practice, since the stable equivalences are the weakequivalences in the stable model structure of theorem \ref{StableModelStructuresOnDiagramSpectra}, while the [[stable weak homotopy equivalences]] are typically more readily identified.

The argument that every stable weak homotopy equivalence is in particular a stable equivalence is fairly formal; this we turn to first in prop. \ref{StableWeakHomotopyEquivalenceIsStableEquivalence} below. The converse statement however relies on explicit analysis of the class $K$ of generatinc acylic cofibrations in def. \ref{GeneratingAndGeneratingAcyclicCofibrationsForDiagramSpectra}. This takes a bit more work below, starting with prop. \ref{ExplicitFormOfFreeSpectra}.

Let $E$ be an Omega-spectrum. Then by the first item of lemma \ref{PropertiesOfAKindOfAlmostSpectrification}, for every $X$ the morphism

  [X,r_E]_{strict}
    \;\colon\; 
  [X,E]_{strict} 
    \longrightarrow 
  [X, R^\infty E]_{strict}

is an isomorphism. Since $r_{(-)}$ is a [[natural transformation]] (by def. \ref{AKindOfAlmostSpectrification}), the naturality squares gives a factorization of this morphism as

$$
  [X,r_E]_{strict}
    \;\colon\;
  [X,E]_{strict}

  [R^\infty X, R^\infty E]_{strict}
    \stackrel{[r_X,E]_{strict}}{\longrightarrow}
  [X, R^\infty E]_{strict}

Combining this with vertical morphisms as below, which are isomorphisms again by item 1 of lemma \ref{AKindOfAlmostSpectrification},

$$

exhibits a [[retraction]] 

$$
  id \colon [X,E]_{strict} \longrightarrow [R^\infty X,E]_{strict} \longrightarrow [X,E]_{strict}

which is natural in $X$. This naturality now implies a retraction of morphisms

$$
  \array{
    id_{[Y,E]_{strict}} \colon & [Y,E]_{strict} &\longrightarrow& [R^\infty Y,E]_{strict} &\longrightarrow& [Y,E]_{strict}

Finally, by the second item of lemma \ref{PropertiesOfAKindOfAlmostSpectrification}, the middle vertical morphism here is an isomorphism, hence $[f^\ast, E]_{strict}$ is the retract of an iso and hence ([here](retract#RetractOfIso)) an isomorphism itself, for all Omega-spectra $E$. This means by definition that $f^\ast$ is a stable equivalence.

* the [[localization of a ring|localization]] of the [[integers]] at a set $J$ of [[primes]], $c \pi_0(E) \simeq \mathbb{Z}[J^{-1}]$;

* $\mathbb{Z}_n$ for $n \geq 2$.

Then the map in remark \ref{CanonicalMapFromELocalizationToTotalization} is an equivalence

**(Sullivan arithmetic square)**

For every [[spectrum]] $X$ the canonical square

$$
  \array{
    && L_{\mathbb{Q}}X
    \\
    & \swarrow && \nwarrow
    \\

Original statements of this include ([Bousfield 79](#Bousfield79), [Sullivan 05, prop. 3.20](#Sullivan05)). Review includes ([van Koughnett 13, prop. 4.5](#VanKoughnett13)). 


So the [[arithmetic fracture square]] from [[Weil uniformization theorem|Weil uniformization]] over [[Spec(S)]] synthesizes spectra from their formal completion and torsion approximation:


$$

    &&  {{localization} \atop {away\;from\;p}} && \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow} && {{p-adic} \atop {residual}}

The product of all [[p-completions]] is equivalently the [[Bousfield localization of spectra]] at the [[wedge sum]] $\vee_p S \mathbb{F}_p$ of all [[Moore spectra]]


$$
  \prod_p L_p X

Moreover there is a  [[Bousfield equivalence]] 

$$
  S (\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}) \simeq_{Bousf} \vee_p S \mathbb{F}_p

The first statement originates around ([Bousfield 79, prop. 2.6](Bousfield+localization+of+spectra#Bousfield79)), review includes ([van Koughnett 13, prop. 4.4](Bousfield+localization+of+spectra#VanKoughnett13)); the second is highlighted in ([Strickland 12, MO comment](http://mathoverflow.net/a/91057/381)).


By prop. \ref{ReformulationOfProdOverPComletionByLocalizationAtCoproduct}
the arithmetic fracture square of prop. \ref{SullivanArithmeticFracture} is equivalently of the form

$$

## **Interlude) Spectral sequences**
 {#SpectralSequences}

In the end, what one wants to compute in stable homotopy 
theory are [[stable homotopy groups]] of [[spectra]] that are built
from other spaces and spectra in some way. Notably one wants to 
know the homotopy groups of [[mapping spectra]] $[X,E]$ ([[generalized cohomology|generalized]] [[cohomology groups]] $E^\bullet(X) \coloneqq \pi_\bullet([X,E])$)
and of [[smash products of spectra]] $E \wedge X$ ([[generalized homology|generalized]] [[homology groups]] $E_\bullet(X)\coloneqq \pi_\bullet(E \wedge X)$).

In general the only practicable way to carry out such computations is by doing them along a decomposition of the given spectrum into a "sequence of stages" of sorts. The concept of _[[spectral sequence]]_ is what formalizes this idea.

(Here the re-occurence of the root "spectr-" it is a historical coincidence, but a lucky one.)


### For filtered complexes
 {#SpectralSequencesForFilteredChainComplexes}

We begin with recalling basics of [[ordinary cohomology|ordinary]] _[[relative homology]]_ and then seamlessly derive the notion of _[[spectral sequences]]_ from that as the natural way of computing the ordinary cohomology of a [[CW-complex]] stagewise from the relative cohomology of its [[simplicial skeleton|skeleta]]. This is meant as motivation and warmup. What we are mostly going to use further below are spectral sequences induced by [[filtered spectra]], this we turn to [next](#SpectralSequencesForFilteredSpectra).

$\,$


Let $X$ be a [[topological space]] and $A \hookrightarrow X$ a [[topological subspace]]. Write $C_\bullet(X)$ for the [[chain complex]] of [[singular homology]] on $X$ and $C_\bullet(A) \hookrightarrow C_\bullet(X)$ for the [[chain map]] induced by the subspace inclusion.

+-- {: .num_defn #RelativeSingularHomology}
###### Definition

The (degreewise) [[cokernel]] of this inclusion, hence the [[quotient]] $C_\bullet(X)/C_\bullet(A)$ of $C_\bullet(X)$ by the [[image]] of $C_\bullet(A)$ under the inclusion, is the **chain complex of $A$-relative singular chains**. 

* A [[boundary]] in this quotient is called an **$A$-relative singular boundary**, 

* a [[cycle]] is called an **$A$-relative singular cycle**.

* The [[chain homology]] of the quotient is the **$A$-relative singular homology of $X$**

  $$
    H_n(X , A)\coloneqq H_n(C_\bullet(X)/C_\bullet(A))
    \,.
  $$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

This means that a singular $(n+1)$-chain $c \in C_{n+1}(X)$ is an $A$-relative cycle precisely if its [[boundary]] $\partial c \in C_{n}(X)$ is, while not necessarily 0, contained in the $n$-chains of $A$: $\partial c \in C_n(A) \hookrightarrow C_n(X)$. So the boundary vanishes possibly only "up to contributions coming from $A$".

=--

We record two evident but important classes of [[long exact sequences]] that relative homology groups sit in:

+-- {: .num_prop #RelativeHomologyLongExactSequence}
###### Proposition

Let $A \stackrel{i}{\hookrightarrow} X$ be a [[topological subspace]] inclusion. The corresponding 
relative singular homology, def. \ref{RelativeSingularHomology}, sits in a [[long exact sequence]] of the form

$$
  \cdots
  \to 
  H_n(A)
   \stackrel{H_n(i)}{\to}
  H_n(X)
  \to 
  H_n(X, A)
   \stackrel{\delta_{n-1}}{\to}
  H_{n-1}(A)
   \stackrel{H_{n-1}(i)}{\to}
  H_{n-1}(X)
  \to 
  H_{n-1}(X, A)
  \to 
  \cdots
  \,.
$$

The [[connecting homomorphism]] $\delta_{n} \colon H_{n+1}(X, A) \to H_n(A)$ sends an element $[c] \in H_{n+1}(X, A)$ represented by an $A$-relative cycle $c \in C_{n+1}(X)$, to the class represented by the [[boundary]] $\partial^X c \in C_n(A) \hookrightarrow C_n(X)$.

###### Proof

This is the _[[homology long exact sequence]]_, prop. \ref{HomologyLongExactSequence}, induced by the defining [[short exact sequence]] $0 \to C_\bullet(A) \stackrel{i}{\hookrightarrow} C_\bullet(X) \to coker(i)  \simeq C_\bullet(X)/C_\bullet(A)  \to 0$ of chain complexes.

###### Proposition

Let $B \hookrightarrow A \hookrightarrow X$ be a sequence of two [[topological subspace]] inclusions. Then there is a [[long exact sequence]] of [[relative singular homology]] groups of the form

$$

Observe that we have a [[short exact sequence]] of chain complexes, def. \ref{ShortExactSequenceOfChainComplexes}

$$
  0 \to C_\bullet(A)/C_\bullet(B) \to C_\bullet(X)/C_\bullet(B) \to C_\bullet(X)/C_\bullet(A) \to 0
  \,.
$$

The corresponding [[homology long exact sequence]], prop. \ref{HomologyLongExactSequence}, is the long exact sequence in question.

We look at some concrete fundamental examples in a moment. But first it is useful to make explicit the following general sub-notion of relative homology.

Let $X$ still be a given [[nLab:topological space]].

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

The **[[nLab:augmentation]] map** for the [[nLab:singular homology]] of $X$ is the [[nLab:homomorphism]] of [[nLab:abelian groups]]

$$
  \epsilon \colon C_0(X) \to \mathbb{Z}
$$

which adds up all the coefficients of all 0-chains:

$$
  \epsilon \colon \colon \sum_{i} n_i \sigma_i \mapsto \sum_i n_i
  \,.
$$

Since the [[nLab:boundary]] of a 1-chain is in the [[nLab:kernel]] of this map, by example \ref{BasicExamplesOfChainBoundaries}, it constitutes a [[nLab:chain map]]

$$
  \epsilon \colon C_\bullet(X) \to \mathbb{Z}
  \,,
$$

where now $\mathbb{Z}$ is regarded as a chain complex concentrated in degree 0.

+-- {: .num_defn #ReducedSingularChainComplex}

$$
  0 \to \tilde C_\bullet(C) \to C_\bullet(X) \stackrel{\epsilon}{\to} \mathbb{Z} \to 0

The **reduced singular homology** $\tilde H_\bullet(X)$ of $X$ is the [[nLab:chain homology]] of the reduced singular chain complex

      \tilde H_n(X) & for \; n \geq 1

    }
  \right.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The [[nLab:homology long exact sequence]], prop. \ref{HomologyLongExactSequence}, of the defining short exact sequence $\tilde C_\bullet(C) \to C_\bullet(X) \stackrel{\epsilon}{\to} \mathbb{Z}$ is, since $\mathbb{Z}$ here is concentrated in degree 0, of the form

$$
  \cdots \to \tilde H_n(X) \to H_n(X) \to 0 \to \cdots \to 
  0 \to 
  \cdots \to \tilde H_1(X) \to H_1(X) \to 0 \to 
  \tilde H_0(X) \to H_0(X) \stackrel{\epsilon}{\to}  \mathbb{Z} \to 0 
  \,.
$$

Here [[nLab:exact sequence|exactness]] says that all the morphisms $\tilde H_n(X) \to H_n(X)$ for positive $n$ are [[nLab:isomorphisms]]. Moreover, since $\mathbb{Z}$ is a [[nLab:free abelian group]], hence a [[nLab:projective object]], the remaining [[nLab:short exact sequence]]

$$
  0 \to \tilde H_0(X) \to H_0(X) \to \mathbb{Z} \to 0
$$

is [[nLab:split exact sequence|split]], by prop. \ref{SplittingLemma}, and hence $H_0(X) \simeq \tilde H_0(X) \oplus \mathbb{Z}$.

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

For $X = *$ the [[nLab:point]], the morphism

$$
  H_0(\epsilon) \colon H_0(X) \to \mathbb{Z}

is an [[nLab:isomorphism]]. Accordingly the reduced homology of the point vanishes in every degree:

$$
  \tilde H_\bullet(*) \simeq 0
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the discussion in section [2)](#SimplicialHomology) we have that 

$$
  H_n(*) \simeq
  \left\{
    \array{
       \mathbb{Z} & for \; n = 0
       \\
       0 & otherwise
    }
  \right.
  \,.
$$

Moreover, it is clear that $\epsilon \colon C_0(*) \to \mathbb{Z}$ is the [[nLab:identity]] map. 

=--

Now we can discuss the relation between reduced homology and relative homology.

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

For $X$ an [[nLab:inhabited set|inhabited]] [[nLab:topological space]], its [[nLab:reduced singular homology]], def. \ref{ReducedSingularChainComplex}, coincides with its [[nLab:relative singular homology]] relative to any base point $x \colon * \to X$:

$$
  \tilde H_\bullet(X)
  \simeq
   H_\bullet(X,*)
  \,.
$$


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Consider the sequence of [[nLab:topological subspace]] inclusions

$$
  \emptyset \hookrightarrow * \stackrel{x}{\hookrightarrow} X
  \,.
$$

By prop. \ref{RelativeTripleHomologyLongExactSequence} this induces a [[nLab:long exact sequence]] of the form

$$
  \cdots
  \to
  H_{n+1}(*) \to H_{n+1}(X) \to H_{n+1}(X,*)
  \to
  H_n(*) \to H_n(X) \to H_n(X,*)
  \to 
  \cdots
  \to 
  H_1(X) \to H_1(X,*) \to  H_0(*) \stackrel{H_0(x)}{\to}  H_0(X) \to H_n(X,*)
  \to 0
  \,.
$$

Here in positive degrees we have $H_n(*) \simeq 0$ and therefore [[nLab:exact sequence|exactness]] gives [[nLab:isomorphisms]]

$$
  H_n(X) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} H_n(X,*)\;\; \forall_{n \geq 1}
$$

and hence with prop. \ref{RelationBetweenReducedSingularAndSingular} isomorphisms

$$
  \tilde H_n(X) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} H_n(X,*)\;\; \forall_{n \geq 1}  
  \,.
$$

It remains to deal with the case in degree 0. To that end, observe that $H_0(x) \colon H_0(*) \to H_0(X)$ is a [[nLab:monomorphism]]: for this notice that we have a [[nLab:commuting diagram]]

$$
  \array{
     H_0(*) &\stackrel{id}{\to}& H_0(*)
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{H_0(x)}}\downarrow &{}^{\mathllap{H_0(f)}}\nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{H_0(\epsilon)}}_\simeq
     \\
     H_0(X) &\stackrel{H_0(\epsilon)}{\to}& \mathbb{Z}
  }
  \,,
$$

where $f \colon X \to *$ is the terminal map. 
That the outer square commutes means that $H_0(\epsilon) \circ H_0(x) = H_0(\epsilon)$ and hence the composite on the left is an [[nLab:isomorphism]]. This implies that $H_0(x)$ is an injection.

Therefore we have a [[nLab:short exact sequence]] as shown in the top of this diagram

$$
  \array{
    0 &\to& H_0(*) &\stackrel{H_0(x)}{\hookrightarrow}&
    H_0(X) &\stackrel{}{\to}& H_0(X,*)
    &\to&
    0
    \\
    && & {}_{\mathllap{\simeq}}\searrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{H_0(\epsilon)}} & 
   \\
   && && \mathbb{Z}
  }
  \,.
$$

Using this we finally compute

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \tilde H_0(X)
    & \coloneqq 
    ker H_0(\epsilon)
    \\
    & \simeq coker( H_0(x) )
    \\
    & \simeq H_0(X,*)
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

With this understanding of homology _relative to a point_ in hand, we can now characterize relative homology more generally.
From its definition in def. \ref{RelativeSingularHomology}, it is plausible that the relative homology group $H_n(X,A)$ provides information about the quotient topological space $X/A$. This is indeed true under mild conditions:

+-- {: .num_defn #GoodPair}
###### Definition

A [[nLab:topological subspace]] inclusion $A \hookrightarrow X$ is called a **good pair** if 

1. $A$ is [[nLab:closed subset|closed]] inside $X$;

1. $A$ has an [[nLab:neighbourhood]] $A \hookrightarrow U \hookrightarrow X$ such that $A \hookrightarrow U$ has a [[nLab:deformation retract]].

+-- {: .num_prop #HomologyOfQuotientSpace}
###### Proposition

If $A \hookrightarrow X$ is a [[nLab:topological subspace]] inclusion which is _good_ in the sense of def. \ref{GoodPair}, then the $A$-relative singular homology of $X$ coincides with the [[nLab:reduced singular homology]], def. \ref{ReducedSingularChainComplex}, of the [[nLab:quotient space]] $X/A$: 

$$
  H_n(X/A)
  \simeq
  \tilde H_n(X , A)
 \,.
$$

=--

The proof of this is spelled out at _[Relative homology -- relation to quotient topological spaces](relative%20homology#RelationToQuotientTopologicalSpaces)_. It needs the proof of the _[Excision property](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/relative%20homology#Excision)_ of relative homology. While important, here we will not further dwell on this. The interested reader can find more information behind the above links.

With the general definition of relative homology in hand, we now consider the basic _cells_ such that _[[nLab:cell complexes]]_ built from such cells have tractable relative homology groups. Actually, up to [[nLab:weak homotopy equivalence]], _every_ [[nLab:Hausdorff topological space]] is given by such a [[nLab:cell complex]] and hence its relative homology, then called _[[nLab:cellular homology]]_, is a good tool for computing singular homology rather generally.

  (notice that the 0-sphere is the disjoint union of _two points_, $S^0 = * \coprod *$, and by definition the $(-1)$-sphere is the [[nLab:empty set]])

$$

Moreover the boundary inclusion is a _good pair_ in the sense of def. \ref{GoodPair}. Therefore the example follows with prop. \ref{HomologyOfQuotientSpace}.

1. a $CW$-complex $X_{n-1}$ of dimension $n-1$;

1. an index set $Cell(X)_n \in Set$;

1. a set of [[nLab:continuous maps]] (the **attaching maps**) $\{ f_i \colon S^{n-1} \to X_{n-1}\}_{i \in Cell(X)_n}$

as the [[nLab:pushout]] 

$$
  X_n 
   \simeq 
  \left(
    \coprod_{j \in Cell(X)_n} D^n
  \right) 
   \underset{j \in Cell(X)_n S^{n-1}}{\coprod} 
   X_n
$$

in

$$
  \array{
    \coprod_{j \in Cell(X)_{n}} S^{n-1} &\stackrel{(f_j)}{\to}& X_{n-1}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \coprod_{j \in Cell(X)_{n}} D^{n} &\to& X_{n} 
  }
  \,,
$$ 

hence as the topological space obtained from $X_{n-1}$ by gluing in $n$-disks $D^n$ for each $j \in Cell(X)_n$ along the given boundary inclusion $f_j \colon S^{n-1} \to X_{n-1}$.

By this construction, an $n$-dimensional CW-complex is canonically a _[[nLab:filtered topological space]]_, hence a sequence of [[nLab:topological subspace]] inclusions of the form

$$
  \emptyset \hookrightarrow X_0 \hookrightarrow X_1 \hookrightarrow \cdots \hookrightarrow X_{n-1} \hookrightarrow X_n
$$

which are the right vertical morphisms in the above pushout diagrams. 

A general **[[nLab:CW complex]]** $X$ then is a [[nLab:topological space]] which is the limiting space of a possibly infinite such sequence, hence a topological space given as the [[nLab:sequential colimit]] over a [[nLab:tower]] [[nLab:diagram]] each of whose morphisms is such a filter inclusion 

$$
  \emptyset \hookrightarrow X_0 \hookrightarrow X_1 \hookrightarrow \cdots \hookrightarrow X
  \,.
$$

The following basic facts about the [[nLab:singular homology]] of [[nLab:CW complexes]] are important.



Now we can state a variant of singular homology adapted to CW complexes which admits a more systematic way of computing its homology groups. First we observe the following.

+-- {: .num_prop #SkeletalRelativeSingularHomologyOfCW}
###### Proposition

The [[nLab:relative singular homology]], def. \ref{RelativeSingularHomology}, of the filtering degrees of a [[nLab:CW complex]] $X$, def. \ref{CWComplex}, is

$$
  H_n(X_k , X_{k-1})
  \simeq
  \left\{
    \array{
       \mathbb{Z}[Cells(X)_n] & if\; k = n
       \\
       0 & otherwise
    }
  \right.
  \,,
$$

where $\mathbb{Z}[Cells(X)_n]$ denotes the [[nLab:free abelian group]] on the set of $n$-cells.


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The inclusion $X_{k-1} \hookrightarrow X_k$ is a _good pair_ in the sense of def. \ref{GoodPair}. The quotient $X_k/X_{k-1}$ is by definition of CW-complexes a [[nLab:wedge sum]], def. \ref{WedgeSum}, of $k$-[[nLab:spheres]], one for each element in $Cell(X)_k$. Therefore by prop. \ref{HomologyOfQuotientSpace} we have an isomorphism $H_n(X_k , X_{k-1}) \simeq \tilde H_n( X_k / X_{k-1})$ with the [[nLab:reduced homology]] of this wedge sum. The statement then follows by the respect of reduced homology for wedge sums, prop. \ref{ReducedHomologyRespectsWedgeSum}.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #SingularHomologyOfCWComples} 
###### Proposition

For $X$ a [[nLab:CW complex]] with skeletal filtration $\{X_n\}_n$ as above, and with $k,n \in \mathbb{N}$ we have for the [[nLab:singular homology]] of $X$ that

$$
  (k \gt n) \Rightarrow (H_k(X_n) \simeq 0)
  \,.
$$

In particular if $X$ is a CW-complex of finite [[nLab:dimension]] $dim X$ (the maximum degree of cells), then 

$$
  (k \gt dim X) \Rightarrow (H_k(X) \simeq 0).
$$

Moreover, for $k \lt n$ the inclusion

$$
  H_k(X_n) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} H_k(X)
$$

is an [[nLab:isomorphism]] and for $k = n$ we have an isomorphism

$$
  image(H_n(X_n) \to H_n(X)) \simeq H_n(X)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the [[nLab:long exact sequence]] in [[nLab:relative homology]], prop. \ref{RelativeHomologyLongExactSequence} we have an [[nLab:exact sequence]] of the form

$$
  H_{k+1}(X_n , X_{n-1})
  \to 
  H_k(X_{n-1})
  \to 
  H_k(X_n)
  \to 
  H_k(X_n, X_{n-1})
  \,.
$$

Now by prop. \ref{SkeletalRelativeSingularHomologyOfCW} the leftmost and rightmost homology groups here vanish when $k \neq n$ and $k \neq n-1$ and hence exactness implies that

$$
  H_k(X_{n-1})
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  H_k(X_n)
$$

is an [[nLab:isomorphism]] for $k \neq n,n-1$. This implies the first claims by [[nLab:induction]] on $n$.

Finally for the last claim use that the above exact sequence gives

$$
  H_{n-1+1}(X_n , X_{n-1})
  \to 
  H_{n-1}(X_{n-1})
  \to 
  H_{n-1}(X_n)
  \to 
  0
$$

and hence that with the above the map $H_{n-1}(X_{n-1}) \to H_{n-1}(X)$ is surjective.

=--

We can now discuss the _[[nLab:cellular homology]]_ of a [[nLab:CW complex]].

+-- {: .num_defn #CellularChainComplex} 
###### Definition

For $X$ a [[nLab:CW-complex]], def. \ref{CWComplex}, its
**cellular chain complex** $H_\bullet^{CW}(X) \in Ch_\bullet$ is the [[nLab:chain complex]] such that for $n \in \mathbb{N}$

* the [[nLab:abelian group]] of [[nLab:chains]] is the [[nLab:relative singular homology]] group, def. \ref{RelativeSingularHomology}, of $X_n \hookrightarrow X$ relative to $X_{n-1} \hookrightarrow X$:

  $$
    H_n^{CW}(X) \coloneqq H_n(X_n, X_{n-1})
    \,,
  $$

* the [[nLab:differential]] $\partial^{CW}_{n+1} \colon H_{n+1}^{CW}(X) \to H_n^{CW}(X)$ is the [[nLab:composition]]

  $$
    \partial^{CW}_n 
    \colon
    H_{n+1}(X_{n+1}, X_n) 
     \stackrel{\partial_n}{\to} 
    H_n(X_n) 
     \stackrel{i_n}{\to} 
    H_n(X_n, X_{n-1})
    \,,
  $$ 

  where $\partial_n$ is the [[nLab:boundary]] map of the [[nLab:singular chain complex]] and where $i_n$ is the morphism on [[nLab:relative homology]] induced from the canonical inclusion of pairs $(X_n, \emptyset) \to (X_n, X_{n-1})$. 

=--

+-- {: .num_prop} 
###### Proposition 

The composition $\partial^{CW}_{n} \circ \partial^{CW}_{n+1}$ of two differentials in def. \ref{CellularChainComplex} is indeed zero, hence $H^{CW}_\bullet(X)$ is indeed a [[nLab:chain complex]].

=-- 

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

On representative singular [[nLab:chains]] the morphism $i_n$ acts as the identity and hence $\partial^{CW}_{n} \circ \partial^{CW}_{n+1}$ acts as the double singular boundary, $\partial_{n} \circ \partial_{n+1} = 0$.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark} 
###### Remark

This means that

* a **cellular $n$-chain** is a singular $n$-chain required to sit in filtering degree $n$, hence in $X_n \hookrightarrow X$;

* a **cellular $n$-cycle** is a singular $n$-chain whose singular boundary is not necessarily 0, but is contained in filtering degree $(n-2)$, hence in $X_{n-2} \hookrightarrow X$.

* a **cellular $n$-boundary** is a singular $n$-chain which is the boundary of a singular $(n+1)$-chain coming from filtering degree $(n+1)$.

=--

This kind of situation -- chains that are cycles only up to lower filtering degree and boundaries that come from specified higher filtering degree -- has an evident generalization to higher relative filtering degrees. And in this greater generality the concept is of great practical relevance. Therefore before discussing cellular homology further now, we consider this more general "higher-order relative homology" that it suggests (namely the formalism of [[nLab:spectral sequences]]). After establishing a few fundamental facts about that we will come back in prop. \ref{SpectralSequenceOfCWComplex} below to analyse the above cellular situation using this conceptual tool.

First we abstract the structure on chain complexes that in the above example was induced by the CW-complex structure on the [[nLab:singular chain complex]].

+-- {: .num_defn #FilteredChainComplex}
###### Definition

The structure of a **[[nLab:filtered chain complex]]** in a [[nLab:chain complex]] $C_\bullet$ is a sequence of [[nLab:chain map]] inclusions

$$
  \cdots
  \hookrightarrow
  F_{p-1}C_\bullet \hookrightarrow F_p C_\bullet \hookrightarrow
  \cdots 
  \hookrightarrow
  C_\bullet
  \,.
$$

The **[[nLab:associated graded]] complex** of a filtered chain complex, denoted $G_\bullet C_\bullet$, is the collection of [[nLab:quotient]] chain complexes

$$
  G_p C_\bullet \coloneqq F_p C_\bullet / F_{p-1} C_\bullet
  \,.
$$

We say that element of $G_p C_\bullet$ are _in filtering degree_ $p$.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

In more detail this means that

1. $[\cdots \stackrel{\partial_{n}}{\to} C_n \stackrel{\partial_{n-1}}{\to} C_{n-1} \to \cdots]$ is a [[nLab:chain complex]], hence $\{C_n\}$ are [[nLab:objects]] in $\mathcal{A}$ ($R$-[[nLab:modules]]) and $\{\partial_n\}$ are [[nLab:morphisms]] (module [[nLab:homomorphisms]]) with $\partial_{n+1} \circ \partial_{n} = 0$;

1. For each $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ there is a [[nLab:filtered object|filtering]] $F_\bullet C_n$ on $C_n$ and all these filterings are compatible with the [[nLab:differentials]] in that 

   $$
     \partial(F_p C_n) \subset F_p C_{n-1}
   $$

1. The grading associated to the filtering is such that the $p$-graded elements are those in the [[nLab:quotient]]

   $$
     G_p C_n \coloneqq \frac{F_p C_n}{ F_{p-1} C_n}
     \,.
   $$

   Since the differentials respect the grading we have chain complexes $G_p C_\bullet$ in each filtering degree $p$.

=--

Hence elements in a filtered chain complex are **[[nLab:bigraded object|bi-graded]]**: they carry a degree as elements of $C_\bullet$ as usual, but now they also carry a filtering degree: for $p,q \in \mathbb{Z}$ we therefore also write

$$
  C_{p,q} \coloneqq F_p C_{p+q}
$$

and call this the collection of **$(p,q)$-chains** in the filtered chain complex.

Accordingly we have $(p,q)$-cycles and -boundaries. But for these we may furthermore refine to a notion where also the filtering degree of the boundaries is constrained:


+-- {: .num_defn #AlmostChainsCyclesBoundaries}
###### Definition

Let $F_\bullet C_\bullet$ be a [[nLab:filtered chain complex]].  Its [[nLab:associated graded]] chain complex is the set of chain complexes

$$
  G_p C_\bullet \coloneqq F_p C_\bullet / F_{p-1} C_\bullet
$$

for all $p$. 

Then for $r, p, q \in \mathbb{Z}$ we say that

1. $G_p C_{p+q}$ is the module of ***$(p,q)$-[[nLab:chains]]*** or of ***$(p+q)$-chains in filtering degree $p$***;

1. $\begin{aligned} Z^r_{p,q}  & \coloneqq \left\{ c \in G_p C_{p+q} | \partial c = 0 \, mod F_{p-r} C_{\bullet} \right\} \\ & =  \left\{ c \in F_p C_{p+q} | \partial(c) \in F_{p-r} C_{p+q-1} \right\}/ F_{p-1}C_{p+q} \end{aligned}$

   is the module of ***$r$-almost $(p,q)$-[[nLab:cycles]]*** (the $(p+q)$-chains whose differential vanishes modulo terms of filtering degree $p-r$);


1. $B^{r}_{p,q} \coloneqq \partial(F_{p+r-1} C_{p+q+1}) \,,$

   is the module of **$r$-almost $(p,q)$-[[nLab:boundaries]]**.

=--

Similarly we set

$$
  Z^\infty_{p,q} \coloneqq \{c \in F_p C_{p + q} | \partial c = 0 \}/F_{p-1}C_{p+q}
  = 
  Z(G_p C_{p+q})
$$

$$
  B^\infty_{p,q} \coloneqq \partial( F_p C_{p+q+1} )
  \,.
$$

From this definition we immediately have that the differentials $\partial \colon C_{p+q} \to C_{p+q-1}$ restrict to the $r$-almost cycles as follows:

+-- {: .num_prop #DifferentialsOnAlmostChains}
###### Proposition

The [[nLab:differentials]] of $C_\bullet$ restrict on $r$-almost cycles to homomorphisms of the form

$$
  \partial^r 
   \colon
  Z^r_{p,q}
  \to
  Z^r_{p-r, q+r-1}
  \,.
$$

These are still [[nLab:differentials]]: $\partial^2 = 0$.

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the very definition of $Z^r_{p,q}$ it consists of elements in filtering degree $p$ on which $\partial$ decreases the filtering degree to $p-r$. Also by definition of differential on a chain complex, $\partial$ decreases the actual degree $p+q$ by one. This explains that $\partial$ restricted to $Z^r_{p,q}$ lands in $Z^\bullet_{p-r,q+r-1}$. 
Now the image constists indeed of actual boundaries, not just $r$-almost boundaries. But since actual boundaries are in particular $r$-almost boundaries, we may take the [[nLab:codomain]] to be $Z^r_{p-r,q+r-1}$.

=--

As before, we will in general index these differentials by their [[nLab:codomain]] and hence write in more detail

$$
  \partial^r 
   \colon
  Z^r_{p,q}
  \to
  Z^r_{p-r, q+r-1}
  \,.
$$


+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

We have a sequence of canonical inclusions

$$
  B^0_{p,q}
  \hookrightarrow
  B^1_{p,q}
  \hookrightarrow
  \cdots
  B^\infty_{p,q}
  \hookrightarrow
  Z^\infty_{p,q}
  \hookrightarrow
  \cdots 
  \hookrightarrow
  Z^1_{p,q}
  \hookrightarrow
  Z^0_{p,q}
  \,.
$$

=--

The following observation is elementary, and yet this is what drives the theory of [[nLab:spectral sequences]], as it shows that almost cycles may be computed iteratively by homological means themselves.

+-- {: .num_prop #KernelsInsideAlmostCycles}
###### Proposition

The $(r+1)$-almost cycles are the $\partial^r$-[[nLab:kernel]] inside the $r$-almost cycles:

$$
  Z^{r+1}_{p,q}
  \simeq 
  ker( Z^r_{p,q} \stackrel{\partial^r}{\to} Z^r_{p-r, q+r-1} )
  \,.
$$

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

An element $c \in F_p C_{p+q}$ represents 

1. an element in $Z^r_{p,q}$ if $\partial c \in F_{p-r} C_{p+q-1}$

1. an element in $Z^{r+1}_{p,q}$ if even $\partial c \in F_{p-r-1} C_{p+q-1} \hookrightarrow F_{p-r} C_{p+q-1}$.

The second condition is equivalent to $\partial c$ representing the 0-element in the quotient $F_{p-r}C_{p+q-1}/ F_{p-r-1}C_{p+q-1}$. But this is in turn equivalent to $\partial c$ being 0 in $Z^r_{p-r,q+r-1} \subset F_{p-r} C_{p+q-1} / F_{p-r-1} C_{p+q-1}$.

=--

With a definition of almost-cycles and almost-boundaries, of course we are now interested in the corresponding homology groups:

+-- {: .num_defn #ExplicitForm}
###### Definition

For $r, p, q \in \mathbb{Z}$ define the **$r$-almost $(p,q)$-[[nLab:chain homology]]** of the filtered complex to be the [[nLab:quotient]] of the $r$-almost $(p,q)$-cycles by the $r$-almost $(p,q)$-boundaries, def. \ref{AlmostChainsCyclesBoundaries}:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    E^r_{p,q}
    & \coloneqq
    \frac{Z^r_{p,q}}{B^r_{p,q}}
    \\
    & = 
  \frac{
    \left\{
     x \in F_p C_{p+q} \,|\, \partial x \in F_{p-r} C_{p+q-1}
    \right\}
  }
  {
    \partial( F_{p+r-1} C_{p+q+1} ) \oplus F_{p-1} C_{p+q} 
  }
  \end{aligned}
$$

By prop. \ref{DifferentialsOnAlmostChains} the differentials of $C_\bullet$ restrict on the $r$-almost homology groups to maps

$$
  \partial^r : E^r_{p,q} \to E^r_{p-r, q+r - 1}
  \,.
$$


=--

The central property of these $r$-almost homology groups now is their following iterative homological characterization.


+-- {: .num_prop #ExplicitDefIsIndeedSpectralSequ}
###### Proposition

With definition \ref{ExplicitForm} we have that
$E^{r+1}_{\bullet, \bullet}$ is the $\partial^r$-[[nLab:chain homology]] of $E^r_{\bullet, \bullet}$:

$$
  E^{r+1}_{p,q} 
  = 
 \frac{
    ker(\partial^r : E^r_{p,q} \to E^r_{p-r, q+r-1})
  }{
    im( \partial^r : E^r_{p+r, q-r+1} \to E^r_{p,q} )
  }
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By prop. \ref{KernelsInsideAlmostCycles}.

=--

This structure on the collection of $r$-almost cycles of a filtered chain complex thus obtained is called a _[[nLab:spectral sequence]]_:

+-- {: .num_defn #SpectralSequence}
###### Definition

A **homology spectral sequence** of $R$-[[nLab:modules]] is

1. a set $\{E_{p,q}^r\}_{p,q,r \in \mathbb{Z}}$ of $R$-modules;

1. a set $\{ \partial^r_{p,q} \colon E_{p,q}^{r} \to E^r_{p-r, q+r-1} \}_{r,p,q \in \mathbb{Z}}$ of [[nLab:homomorphisms]]

such that

1. the $\partial^r$s are [[nLab:differentials]]: $\forall_{p,q,r}  (\partial^r_{p-r,q+r-1} \circ \partial^r_{p,q} = 0)$;

1. the modules $E^{r+1}_{p,q}$ are the $\partial^r$-[[nLab:homology]] of the modules in relative degree $r$:

   $$
     \forall_{r,p,q} 
     \left(
       E^{r+1}_{p,q} \simeq \frac{ker(\partial^r_{p-r,q+r-1})}{im(\partial^r_{p, q})}
      \right)
     \,.
   $$ 

One says that $E^r_{\bullet,\bullet}$ is the **$r$-page** of the spectral sequence. 

=--

Since this turns out to be a useful structure to make explicit, as the above motivation should already indicate, one introduces the following terminology and basic facts to talk about spectral sequences.


+-- {: .num_defn #LimitTerm}
###### Definition

Let $\{E^r_{p,q}\}_{r,p,q}$ be a [[nLab:spectral sequence]], def. \ref{SpectralSequence}, such that for each $p,q$ there is $r(p,q)$ such that for all $r \geq r(p,q)$ we have

$$
  E^{r \geq r(p,q)}_{p,q} \simeq E^{r(p,q)}_{p,q}
  \,.
$$

Then one says that

1. the [[nLab:bigraded object]]

   $$
     E^\infty 
      \coloneqq 
     \{E^\infty_{p,q}\}_{p,q} \coloneqq \{ E^{r(p,q)}_{p,q} \}_{p,q}

   is the **limit term** of the spectral sequence;

*  the spectral sequence **abuts** to $E^\infty$.

+-- {: .num_example #Degeneration}
###### Example

If for a spectral sequence there is $r_s$ such that all [[nLab:differentials]] on pages after $r_s$ vanish, $\partial^{r \geq r_s} = 0$, then $\{E^{r_s}\}_{p,q}$ is a limit term for the spectral sequence. One says in this cases that the spectral sequence **degenerates** at $r_s$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the defining relation

$$
  E^{r+1}_{p,q} \simeq ker(\partial^r_{p-r,q+r-1})/im(\partial^r_{p,q}) = E^r_{pq}
$$

the spectral sequence becomes constant in $r$ from $r_s$ on if all the differentials vanish, so that $ker(\partial^r_{p,q}) = E^r_{p,q}$ for all $p,q$.

+-- {: .num_example #Collaps}
###### Example

If for a [[nLab:spectral sequence]] $\{E^r_{p,q}\}_{r,p,q}$ there is $r_s \geq 2$ such that the $r_s$th page is concentrated in a single row or a single column, then the spectral sequence degenerates on this pages, example \ref{Degeneration}, hence this page is a limit term, def. \ref{LimitTerm}. One says in this case that the spectral sequence **collapses** on this page.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

For $r \geq 2$ the [[nLab:differentials]] of the spectral sequence

$$
  \partial^r \colon E^r_{p,q} \to E^r_{p-r, q+r-1}
$$ 

have [[nLab:domain]] and [[nLab:codomain]] necessarily in different rows an columns (while for $r = 1$ both are in the same row and for $r = 0$ both coincide). Therefore if all but one row or column vanish, then all these differentials vanish.

+-- {: .num_defn #Convergence}
###### Definition

A [[nLab:spectral sequence]] $\{E^r_{p,q}\}_{r,p,q}$ is said to **converge** to a [[nLab:graded object]] $H_\bullet$ with [[nLab:filtered chain complex|filtering]] $F_\bullet H_\bullet$, traditionally denoted

$$

if the [[nLab:associated graded]] complex $\{G_p H_{p+q}\}_{p,q} \coloneqq \{F_p H_{p+q} / F_{p-1} H_{p+q}\}$ of $H$ is the limit term of $E$, def. \ref{LimitTerm}:

In practice spectral sequences are often referred to via their first non-trivial page, often also the page at which it collapses, def. \ref{Collaps}, often already the second page. Then one tends to use notation such as

$$
  E^2_{p,q} \Rightarrow H_\bullet

to be read as "There is a spectral sequence whose second page is as shown on the left and which converges to a filtered object as shown on the right."

###### Proposition

A bounded spectral sequence, def. \ref{BoundedSpectralSequence}, has a limit term, def. \ref{LimitTerm}.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First notice that if a spectral sequence has at most $N$ non-vanishing terms of total degree $n$ on page $r$, then all the following pages have at most at these positions non-vanishing terms, too, since these are the homologies of the previous terms.

Therefore for a bounded spectral sequence for each $n$ there is $L(n) \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $E^r_{p,n-p} = 0$ for all $p \leq L(n)$ and all $r$. Similarly there is $T(n) \in \mathbb{Z}$ such $E^r_{n-q,q} = 0$ for all $q \leq T(n)$ and all $r$.

We claim then that the limit term of the bounded spectral sequence is in position $(p,q)$ given by the value $E^r_{p,q}$ for 

$$
  r \gt max(  p-L(p+q-1), q + 1 - L(p+q+1) )
  \,.
$$

This is because for such $r$ we have

1. $E^r_{p-r, q+r-1} = 0$ because $p-r \lt L(p+q-1)$, and hence the [[nLab:kernel]] $ker(\partial^r_{p-r,q+r-1}) = 0$ vanishes;

1. $E^r_{p+r, q-r+1} = 0$ because $q-r + 1 \lt T(p+q+1)$, and hence the [[nLab:image]] $im(\partial^r_{p,q}) = 0$ vanishes.

Therefore

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    E^{r+1}_{p,q} 
    &= 
    ker(\partial^r_{p-r,q+r-1})/im(\partial^r_{p,q})
    \\
    & \simeq E^r_{p,q}/0
    \\
    & \simeq E^r_{p,q}
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

The central statement about the notion of the spectral sequence of a filtered chain complex then is the following proposition. It says that the iterative computation of higher order relative homology indeed in the limit computes the genuine homology.

+-- {: .num_defn #FilteringOnHomology}
###### Definition

For $F_\bullet C_\bullet$ a [[nLab:filtered complex]], write for $p \in \mathbb{Z}$

$$
  F_p H_\bullet(C) 
   \coloneqq
  image( H_\bullet(F_p C) \to H_\bullet(C) )
  \,.
$$

This defines a [[nLab:filtered object|filtering]] $F_\bullet H_\bullet(C)$ of the homology, regarded as a graded object.

=--


+-- {: .num_prop #ConvergingToGenuineHomology}
###### Proposition

If the [[nLab:spectral sequence of a filtered complex]] $F_\bullet C_\bullet$ of prop. \ref{ExplicitDefIsIndeedSpectralSequ} has a limit term, def. \ref{LimitTerm} then it converges, def. \ref{Convergence}, to the chain homology of $C_\bullet$

$$
  E^r_{p,q} \Rightarrow H_{p+q}(C_\bullet)
  \,,
$$

i.e. for sufficiently large $r$ we have

$$
  E^r_{p,q} \simeq G_p H_{p+q}(C) 
  \,,
$$

where on the right we have the [[nLab:associated graded object]] of the filtering of def. \ref{FilteringOnHomology}.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By assumption, there is for each $p,q$ an $r(p,q)$ such that for all $r \geq r(p,q)$ the $r$-almost cycles and $r$-almost boundaries, def. \ref{AlmostChainsCyclesBoundaries}, in $F_p C_{p+q}$ are the ordinary [[nLab:cycles]] and [[nLab:boundaries]]. Therefore for $r \geq r(p,q)$ def. \ref{ExplicitForm} gives $E^r_{p,q} \simeq G_p H_{p+q}(C)$.


=--

This says what these spectral sequences are converging to. For computations it is also important to know how they start out for low $r$. We can generally characterize $E^r_{p,q}$ for very low values of $r$ simply as follows:

+-- {: .num_prop #SpectralSequencePagesForLowr}
###### Proposition

We have

* $E^0_{p,q} = G_p C_{p+q} = F_p C_{p+q} / F_{p-1} C_{p+q}$ 

  is the [[nLab:associated graded|associated p-graded]] piece of $C_{p+q}$;

* $E^1_{p,q} = H_{p+q}(G_p C_\bullet)$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

For $r = 0$ def. \ref{ExplicitForm} restricts to

$$
  E^0_{p,q} = \frac{ F_p C_{p+q}}{F_{p-1} C_{p+q}} = G_p C_{p+q}
$$

because for $c \in F_p C_{p+q}$ we automatically also have $\partial c \in F_p C_{p+q}$ since the differential respects the filtering degree by assumption. 

For $r = 1$ def. \ref{ExplicitForm} gives 

$$
  E^1_{p,q} = \frac{\{c \in G_p C_{p+q} | \partial c = 0 \in G_p C_{p+q}\} }{\partial(F_p C_{p+q})} = H_{p+q} (G_p C_\bullet)
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

There is, in general, a decisive difference between the homology of the associated graded complex $H_{p+q}(G_p C_\bullet)$ and the associated graded piece of the genuine homology $G_p H_{p+q}(C_\bullet)$: in the former the differentials of cycles are required to vanish only up to terms in lower degree, but in the latter they are required to vanish genuinely. The latter expression is instead the value of the spectral sequence for $r \to \infty$, see prop. \ref{ConvergingToGenuineHomology} below.

These general facts now allow us, as a first simple example for the application of [[nLab:spectral sequences]] to see transparently that the [[nLab:cellular homology]] of a CW complex, def. \ref{CellularChainComplex}, coincides with its genuine [[nLab:singular homology]].

First notice that of course the structure of a [[nLab:CW-complex]] on a [[nLab:topological space]] $X$, def. \ref{CWComplex} naturally induces on its [[nLab:singular simplicial complex]] $C_\bullet(X)$ the structure of a [[nLab:filtered chain complex]], def. \ref{FilteredChainComplex}:


+-- {: .num_defn #SpectralSequenceOfSingularChainsInCWComplex} 
###### Definition

For $X_0 \hookrightarrow X_1 \hookrightarrow \cdots \hookrightarrow X$ a 
[[nLab:CW complex]], and $p \in \mathbb{N}$, write

$$
  F_p C_\bullet(X) \coloneqq C_\bullet(X_p)
$$

for the [[nLab:singular chain complex]] of $X_p \hookrightarrow X$. The given  [[nLab:topological subspace]] inclusions $X_p \hookrightarrow X_{p+1}$ induce [[nLab:chain map]] inclusions $F_p C_\bullet(X) \hookrightarrow F_{p+1} C_\bullet(X)$ and these equip the singular chain complex $C_\bullet(X)$ of $X$ with the structure of a bounded [[nLab:filtered chain complex]]

$$

(If $X$ is of finite [[nLab:dimension]] $dim X$ then this is a bounded filtration.)

Write $\{E^r_{p,q}(X)\}$ for the [[nLab:spectral sequence of a filtered complex]] corresponding to this filtering.

+-- {: .num_prop #SpectralSequenceOfCWComplex} 
###### Proposition

The spectral sequence $\{E^r_{p,q}(X)\}$ of singular chains in a [[nLab:CW complex]] $X$, def. \ref{SpectralSequenceOfSingularChainsInCWComplex} converges, def. \ref{Convergence}, to the [[nLab:singular homology]] of $X$:

$$
  E^r_{p,q}(X) \Rightarrow H_\bullet(X)
  \,.
$$ 

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The spectral sequence $\{E^r_{p,q}(X)\}$ is clearly a first-quadrant spectral sequence, def. \ref{QuadrantSpectralSequence}. Therefore it is a bounded spectral sequence, def. \ref{BoundedSpectralSequence} and hence has a limit term, def. \ref{BoundedSpectralSequenceHasLimitTerm}. So the statement follows with prop. \ref{ConvergingToGenuineHomology}.

=--


We now identify the low-degree pages of $\{E^r_{p,q}(X)\}$ with structures in singular homology theory.

###### Proposition

* $r = 0$ -- $E^0_{p,q}(X) \simeq C_{p+q}(X_p)/C_{p+q}(X_{p-1})$ is the group of $X_{p-1}$-[[nLab:relative homology|relative (p+q)-chains]], def. \ref{RelativeSingularHomology}, in $X_p$;

* $r = 1$ -- $E^1_{p,q}(X) \simeq H_{p+q}(X_p, X_{p-1})$ is the $X_{p-1}$-[[nLab:relative singular homology]], def. \ref{RelativeSingularHomology}, of $X_p$;

* $r = 2$ -- $E^2_{p,q}(X) \simeq \left\{ \array{ H_p^{CW}(X) & for\; q = 0 \\ 0 & otherwise }  \right.$

* $r = \infty$ -- $E^\infty_{p,q}(X) \simeq F_p H_{p+q}(X) / F_{p-1} H_{p+q}(X) $.

###### Proof

By straightforward and immediate analysis of the definitions.

As a result of these general considerations we now obtain the promised isomorphism between the cellular homology and the singular homology of a CW-complex $X$:

+-- {: .num_cor #CelluarEquivalentToSingularFromSpectralSequence} 
###### Corollary

For $X \in $ [[nLab:Top]] a [[nLab:CW complex]], def. \ref{CWComplex}, its [[nLab:cellular homology]], def. \ref{CellularChainComplex} $H^{CW}_\bullet(X)$ coincides with its singular homology $H_\bullet(X)$, def. \ref{SingularHomology}:  

$$ 
  H^{CW}_\bullet(X) \simeq H_\bullet(X)
 \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the third item of prop. \ref{PagesInTheSpectralSequenceOfTheFilteredSingularComplex} the $(r = 2)$-page of the spectral sequence $\{E^r_{p,q}(X)\}$ is concentrated in the $(q = 0)$-row and hence it collapses there, def. \ref{Collaps}. Accordingly we have 

$$
  E^\infty_{p,q}(X) \simeq E^2_{p,q}(X)
$$

for all $p,q$. By the third and fourth item of prop. \ref{PagesInTheSpectralSequenceOfTheFilteredSingularComplex} this non-trivial only for $q = 0$ and there it is equivalently

$$
  G_p H_{p}(X) \simeq H^{CW}_p(X)
  \,.
$$

Finally observe that $G_p H_p(X) \simeq H_p(X)$ by the definition of the filtering on the homology, def. \ref{FilteringOnHomology}, and using prop. \ref{SingularHomologyOfCWComples}.

### For filtered spectra
 {#SpectralSequencesForFilteredSpectra}

+-- {: .num_defn #FilteredSpectrum}
###### Definition

A [[filtered spectrum]] is a [[spectrum]] $X$ equipped with a sequence $X_\bullet \colon (\mathbb{N}, \gt) \longrightarrow Spectra$  of spectra of the form

$$
  \cdots 
   \longrightarrow
  X_3
    \stackrel{f_2}{\longrightarrow} 
  X_2 
    \stackrel{f_1}{\longrightarrow} 
  X_1 \stackrel{f_0}{\longrightarrow} X_0 = X

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

More generally a [[filtered object in an (infinity,1)-category|filtering]] on an object $X$ in (stable or not) [[homotopy theory]] is a $\mathbb{Z}$-graded sequence $X_\bullet $ such that $X$ is the [[homotopy colimit]]  $X\simeq \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim} X_\bullet$. But for the present purpose we stick with the simpler special case of def. \ref{FilteredSpectrum}.

=--


+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

There is _no_ condition on the [[morphisms]] in def. \ref{FilteredSpectrum}. In particular, they are _not_ required to be [[n-monomorphisms]] or [[n-epimorphisms]] for any $n$. 

On the other hand, while they are also not explicitly required to have a presentation by [[cofibrations]] or [[fibrations]], this follows automatically: by the existence of [[model structures for spectra]], every filtering on a spectrum is equivalent to one in which all morphisms are represented by [[cofibrations]] or by [[fibrations]]. 

This means that we may think of a filtration on a spectrum $X$ in the sense of def. \ref{FilteredSpectrum} as equivalently being a [[tower of fibrations]] over $X$.

The following remark \ref{UnrolledExactCoupleOfAFiltrationOnASpectrum} unravels the structure encoded in a filtration on a spectrum, and motivates the concepts of [[exact couples]] and their [[spectral sequences]] from these.


+-- {: .num_remark #UnrolledExactCoupleOfAFiltrationOnASpectrum}
###### Remark

Given a [[filtered spectrum]] as in def. \ref{FilteredSpectrum},
write $A_k$ for the [[homotopy cofiber]] of its $k$th stage, such as to obtain the diagram

$$
  \array{
   \cdots 
     &\stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}& 
   X_3 
     &\stackrel{f_2}{\longrightarrow}& 
   X_2

   X_1 
     &\stackrel{f_1}{\longrightarrow}& 
   X
   \\
   && \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
   \\
   && A_3 && A_2 && A_1 && A_0
  }
$$

where each stage

$$
 \array{
   X_{k+1} &\stackrel{f_k}{\longrightarrow}& X_k   
   \\
   && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{cofib(f_k)}}
   \\
   && A_k
 }
$$

is a [[homotopy fiber sequence]]. 

To break this down into invariants, apply the [[stable homotopy groups]]-[[functor]]. This yields a diagram of $\mathbb{Z}$-[[graded abelian groups]] of the form

$$
  \array{
   \cdots 
     &\stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}& 
   \pi_\bullet(X_3) 
     &\stackrel{\pi_\bullet(f_2)}{\longrightarrow}& 
   \pi_\bullet(X_2) 
     &\stackrel{\pi_\bullet(f_2)}{\longrightarrow} & 
   \pi_\bullet(X_1) 
     &\stackrel{\pi_\bullet(f_1)}{\longrightarrow}& 
   \pi_\bullet(X_0)
   \\
   && \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
   \\
   && \pi_\bullet(A_3) && \pi_\bullet(A_2) && \pi_\bullet(A_1) && \pi_\bullet(A_0)
  }
  \,.
$$

By prop. \ref{LongExactSequenceofHomotopyGroups}, here each hook at stage $k$ extends to a [[long exact sequence of homotopy groups]] via [[connecting homomorphisms]] $\delta_\bullet^k$

$$
  \cdots
    \to
  \pi_{\bullet+1}(A_k)

  \pi_\bullet(X_k)
    \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}
  \pi_\bullet(A_k)
   \stackrel{\delta_\bullet^k}{\longrightarrow}
  \pi_{\bullet-1}(X_{k+1})
  \to 
  \cdots
  \,.
$$

If we understand the [[connecting homomorphism]]

$$
  \delta_k \colon \pi_\bullet(A_k) \longrightarrow \pi_\bullet(X_{k+1})
$$

as a morphism of degree -1, then all this information fits into one diagram of the form

$$
  \array{
   \cdots 
     &\stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}& 
   \pi_\bullet(X_3) 
     &\stackrel{\pi_\bullet(f_2)}{\longrightarrow}& 
   \pi_\bullet(X_2) 
     &\stackrel{\pi_\bullet(f_2)}{\longrightarrow} & 
   \pi_\bullet(X_1)

   & \downarrow
   \\
   && \pi_\bullet(A_3) && \pi_\bullet(A_2) && \pi_\bullet(A_1) && \pi_\bullet(A_0)
  }
  \,,
$$

where each triangle is a rolled-up incarnation of a [[long exact sequence of homotopy groups]] (and in particular is _not_ a commuting diagram!).

If we furthermore consider the [[bigraded object|bigraded]] [[abelian groups]] $\pi_\bullet(X_\bullet)$ and $\pi_\bullet(A_\bullet)$, then this information may further be rolled-up to a single diagram of the form

$$
  \array{
     \pi_\bullet(X_\bullet)
       & \stackrel{\pi_\bullet(f_\bullet)}{\longrightarrow} &
     \pi_\bullet(X_\bullet)

       & {}_{\mathllap{\delta}}\nwarrow 
       & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\pi_\bullet(cofib(f_\bullet))}}
     \\
     && 
     \pi_\bullet(A_\bullet)
  }
$$

where the morphisms $\pi_\bullet(f_\bullet)$, $\pi_\bullet(cofib(f_\bullet))$ and $\delta$ have bi-degree $(0,-1)$, $(0,0)$ and $(-1,1)$, respectively.

Here it is convenient to shift the bigrading, equivalently, by setting

$$
  \mathcal{D}^{s,t} \coloneqq \pi_{t-s}(X_s)
$$

$$
  \mathcal{E}^{s,t} \coloneqq \pi_{t-s}(A_s)
  \,,
$$

because then $t$ counts the cycles of going around the triangles:

$$
  \cdots
   \to 
  \mathcal{D}^{s+1,t+1}
    \stackrel{\pi_{t-s}(f_s)}{\longrightarrow}
  \mathcal{D}^{s,t}

  \mathcal{E}^{s,t}
    \stackrel{\delta_s}{\longrightarrow}
  \mathcal{D}^{s+1,t}

The concept of exact couple so far just collects the sequences of long exact sequences given by a filtration. Next we turn to extracting information from this sequence of sequences.

+-- {: .num_remark #Observingd1}
###### Remark

The sequence of long exact sequences in remark \ref{UnrolledExactCoupleOfAFiltrationOnASpectrum} is inter-locking, in that every $\pi_{t-s}(X_s)$ appears _twice_:

$$
  \array{
    && & \searrow && \nearrow
    \\
    && && \pi_{t-s-1}(X_{s+1})
    \\
    && & {}^{\mathllap{\delta_{t-s}^s}}\nearrow 
    && \searrow^{\mathrlap{\pi_{t-s-1}(cofib(f_{s+1}))}}
    && && && \nearrow
    \\
    && \pi_{t-s}(A_s) && \underset{def: \;\;d_1^{s,t}}{\longrightarrow} && \pi_{t-s-1}(A_{s+1})
    && \stackrel{def: \; d_1^{s+1,t}}{\longrightarrow} && \pi_{t-s-2}(A_{s+2})
    \\
    & \nearrow && && && {}_{\mathllap{\delta_{t-s-1}^{s+1}}}\searrow 
    && \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\pi_{t-s-2}(cofib(f_{s+2}))}}
    \\
    && && && && \pi_{t-s-2}(X_{s+2})
    \\
    && && && & \nearrow && \searrow
  }
$$

This gives rise to the horizontal composites $d_1^{s,t}$, as show above, and by the fact that the diagonal sequences are long exact, these are differentials: $d_1^2 = 0$, hence give a [[chain complex]]:

$$
  \array{
    \cdots & \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}
    && \pi_{t-s}(A_s) && \overset{d_1^{s,t}}{\longrightarrow} && \pi_{t-s-1}(A_{s+1})
    && \stackrel{d_1^{s+1,t}}{\longrightarrow} && \pi_{t-s-2}(A_{s+2})
    &&\longrightarrow & \cdots
  }
  \,.
$$

We read off from the interlocking long exact sequences what these differentials _mean_: an element $c \in \pi_{t-s}(A_s)$ lifts to an element $\hat c \in \pi_{t-s-1}(X_{s+2})$ precisely if $d_1 c = 0$:

$$
  \array{
    &\hat c \in & \pi_{t-s-1}(X_{s+2})
    \\
    && & \searrow^{\mathrlap{\pi_{t-s-1}(f_{s+1})}} 
    \\
    && && \pi_{t-s-1}(X_{s+1})
    \\
    && & {}^{\mathllap{\delta_{t-s}^s}}\nearrow 
    && \searrow^{\mathrlap{\pi_{t-s-1}(cofib(f_{s+1}))}}
    \\
    & c \in  & \pi_{t-s}(A_s) && \underset{d_1^{s,t}}{\longrightarrow} && \pi_{t-s-1}(A_{s+1})
  }
$$

This means that the [[cochain cohomology]] of the complex $(\pi_{\bullet}(A_\bullet), d_1)$ produces elements of $\pi_\bullet(X_\bullet)$ and hence of $\pi_\bullet(X)$.

In order to organize this observation, notice that in terms of the exact couple of remark \ref{UnrolledExactCoupleOfAFiltrationOnASpectrum}, the differential 

$$
  d_1^{s,t}  \;\coloneqq \; \pi_{t-s-1}(cofib(f_{s+1})) \circ \delta_{t-s}^s

is a component of the composite

the bidegree of $i$ and $k$ is preserved, but that of $j$ increases by $(1,1)$ in each step, since

## **Part 2) Adams spectral sequences**


The basic invariants of [[stable homotopy theory]], the [[stable homotopy groups]], are as rich and interesting as they are, in general, hard to compute. The archetypical example for this phenonemon are the [[stable homotopy groups of spheres]] $\pi_\bullet(\mathbb{S})$. More generally one is interested in the stable homotopy groups of [[mapping spectra]] $\pi_\bullet[Y,X] \simeq X^\bullet(Y)$ which are [[generalized cohomology]] [[cohomology group|groups]] of $Y$ with [[coefficients]] in $X$. As discussed above in _[Interlude: Spectral sequences](#SpectralSequences)_ the tool of choice to break such problems up into stages are [[spectral sequences]].

Where the [[Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence]] ([here](#SerreAtiyahHirzebruchSpectralSequence)) approximates $\pi_\bullet[Y,X]$ via the [[ordinary cohomology]] $\pi_\bullet(Y,H X_\bullet)$, the idea of the [[Adams spectral sequence]] is to make use of an auxiliary [[ring spectrum]] $E$ and approximate maps of spectra $Y \to X$ via their image $E_\bullet(Y) \to E_\bullet(X)$ in $E$-[[generalized homology]]. 

But in order for maps of homology groups to have a chance to retain enough information, they should be forced to be equivariant with respect to extra structure inherited by forming $E$-homology. 

For instance if $E = $ $H \mathbb{F}_2$ then the [[dual Steenrod algebra]] $\mathcal{A}$ (co-)acts on $E_\bullet(X) = H_\bullet(X,\mathbb{F}_2)$ and a necessary condition for a morphism of homology groups to come from a morphism of spectra is that it is a [[homomorphism]] with respect to this (co-action).  The classical [[Adams spectral sequence]], accordingly, approximates $[Y,X]_\bullet$ by $Hom_{\mathcal{A}}(H_\bullet(Y,\mathbb{F}_2), H_\bullet(X,\mathbb{F}_2))$. (...)

More generally, since spectra are equivalently [[module spectra]] over the [[sphere spectrum]] $\mathbb{S}$, the operation of forming $E$-homology spectra $X \mapsto E \wedge S$ is equivalently the [[extension of scalars]] along the ring unit $\mathbb{S}\longrightarrow E$. This means that the extra structure inherited by $E$-homology groups contains the information given by the further extensions along the [[cosimplicial object|cosimplicial]] diagram

$$
  \mathbb{S} \longrightarrow E \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow} E \wedge E \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow}}
  E \wedge E \wedge E
  \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow}}}
  \cdots
 \,.
$$

This gives $E_\bullet(X)$ the structure of a [[module]] over the [[Hopf algebroid]] $\pi_\bullet(E \wedge E) = E_\bullet(E) \stackrel{\longleftarrow}{\longleftarrow} E_\bullet$. Accordingly the general $E$-[[Adams spectral sequence]] (or: [[Adams-Novikov spectral sequence]]) approximates $\pi_\bullet[Y,X]$ by $Hom_{E_\bullet(E)}(E_\bullet(Y),E_\bullet(X))$.

### **2.1)** Theory
 {#TheoryforAdamsSpectralSequences}

Here we set up the general theory of $E$-[[Adams spectral sequences]]. (We consider examples and applications further [below](#ExamplesOfAdamsSpectralSequences).)

**Literature** We follow the perspective in ([Hopkins 99, section 5](#Hopkins99)) as worked out in ([Aramian](#Aramian)). We also use some input from ([Adams 74, part III.15](#Adams74)).



#### $E$-Adams resolutions

The $E$-[[Adams resolutions]] in [[stable homotopy theory]] that we are about to consider behave [[analogy|analogous]] to [[injective resolutions]] in [[homological algebra]]. For a streamlined discussion of $E$-Adams resolutions it is convenient to make that analogy precise ([Miller 81](#Miller81)).

Notice that the standard concept of [[exact sequences]] and [[injective objects]] makes sense in [[abelian categories]], but not in the [[stable homotopy theory]] of [[spectra]]; for instance the true homotopy theoretic analog of exact sequences are [[homotopy fiber sequences]]. But for computational purposes we may consider a variant (due to [Miller 81](#Miller81)), where a sequence of spectra $X_\bullet$ is regarded as exact if the [[homotopical functor]] to abelian groups that it represents sends objects to standard exact sequences.  

+-- {: .num_defn #HomotopicalFunctorCoRepresentedByASpectrum}
###### Definition

For $X$ a [[spectrum]], we say that the _[[homotopical functor]]_
that it [[representable functor|co-represents]] is the functor of [[stable homotopy groups]] of the [[mapping spectrum]]-construction out of $X$, regarded as a functor on the [[stable homotopy category]]:

$$
  \pi_\bullet[X, -] \colon Ho(Spectra) \longrightarrow Ab^{\mathbb{Z}}
  \,.
$$

(Regarded as an [[(∞,1)-functor]] on the [[stable (∞,1)-category of spectra]] this is also called the _[[homological functor]]_ co-represented by $X$.)

$$

is the [[stable homotopy group]]-functor.

###### Definition

Say that 

1. a sequence of [[spectra]]

   $$
     A_1 \longrightarrow A_2 \longrightarrow \cdots \longrightarrow A_n
   $$

   is 

   1. a (long) _exact sequence_ if the induced sequence of [[homotopy functors]] according to def. \ref{HomotopicalFunctorCoRepresentedByASpectrum}, is a [[long exact sequence]] in $[HoSpectra,Ab^{\mathbb{Z}}]$;

   2. (for $n = 2$) a _short exact sequence_ if

      $$
        0 \longrightarrow A_1 \longrightarrow A_2 \longrightarrow A_3 \longrightarrow 0
      $$

      is (long) exact in the above sense;


1. a morphism $A \longrightarrow B$  is 

   1. a _monomorphism_ if $0 \longrightarrow A \longrightarrow B$ is an exact sequence in the above sense;

   1. an _epimorphism_ if $A \longrightarrow B \longrightarrow 0$ is an exact sequence in the above sense.

For $E$ a [[ring spectrum]], then a sequence of spectra is called (long/short) _$E$-exact_ and a morphism is epi/mono, respectively, if becomes long/short exact or epi/mono, respectively, after taking [[smash product of spectra|smash product]] with $E$.

We need to check that for every $X$ the morphism $i^\ast \colon [B, X]\to [A,X]$ is surjective. By retraction, given $f \colon A \to X$, then $r \circ f \colon B \stackrel{r}{\to} A \stackrel{f}{\to} X$ is a preimage.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We need to check that $E \wedge X \stackrel{id \wedge e \wedge id}{\longrightarrow} E \wedge E \wedge X$ is a monomorphism in the sense of def. \ref{ExactSequences}. Observe that this morphism has a [[retraction]] given by $\mu \wedge id$. Therefore it is a monomorphism by

###### Remark/Warning

Consecutive morphisms in an $E$-exact sequence according to def. \ref{ExactSequences} in general need not compose up to homotopy, to the [[zero morphism]]. But this does become true for sequences of $E$-injective objects, defined below in def. \ref{EInjective}.

=--

+-- {: .num_lemma #CharacterizationOfEpiMonomorphismsOfSpectra}
###### Lemma

1. If $f \colon B\longrightarrow A$ is a monomorphism in the sense of def. \ref{ExactSequences}, then there exists a morphism $g \colon C \longrightarrow A$ such that the [[wedge sum]] morphism is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]]

   $$
     f \vee g \;\colon\; B \wedge C \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} A
     \,.
   $$

   In particular, every morphism in [[Ho(Spectra)]] has an [[extension]] along a monomorphism in this sense. 

1. If $f \colon A \longrightarrow B$ is an epimorpimsm in the sense of def. \ref{ExactSequences}, then there exists a homotopy [[section]] $s \colon B\to A$, i.e. $f\circ s\simeq Id$, together with a morphism $g \colon C \to A$ such that the [[wedge sum]] morphism is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]]

   $$
     s \vee f \colon B\vee C \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} A
     \,.
   $$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Given a monomorphism $f \colon A \longrightarrow B$, consider the correspondiing [[homotopy cofiber sequence]]

$$
  A\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow} B \stackrel{r}{\longrightarrow} C  \stackrel{\delta}{\longrightarrow} \Sigma A \stackrel{-\Sigma f}{\longrightarrow} \Sigma B
  \,.
$$

We first observe that the [[connecting homomorphism]] is equivalent to the [[zero morphism]] $\delta \simeq 0$. This follows because by example \ref{HomotopyCofiberSequencesAreExactSequencesOfSpectra} the sequence

$$
  [C,X] 
    \stackrel{\delta^\ast_\bullet}{\longleftarrow} 
  [\Sigma A, X]
    \stackrel{(-\Sigma f)^\ast_\bullet}{\longleftarrow}
  [\Sigma B, X]
$$

is an [[exact sequence]] (of homotopy groups) for every $X$, while by example \ref{SuspensionPreservesExactSequencesOfSpectra} the morphism on the right is epi, so that $\delta^\ast_\bullet = 0$.

Now since $B \stackrel{r}{\longrightarrow} C \stackrel{\delta \simeq 0}{\longrightarrow}$ is also a [[homotopy fiber sequence]], the [[pasting law]] identifies $B \simeq C \times A \simeq C \vee A$:

$$
  \array{
    B \simeq C \times A &\longrightarrow& A &\longrightarrow& 0 
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow

$$

+-- {: .num_lemma #EInjectiveSpectraAreRetractsOfFreeEModules}
###### Lemma

A spectrum is $E$-injective in the sense of def. \ref{EInjective}, precisely if it is a [[retract]] in [[HoSpectra]] of a free $E$-modules, hence of $E \wedge X$ for some spectrum $X$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

In one direction, assume that $S$ is $E$-injective and consider the diagram

$$
  \array{
    S &\stackrel{id}{\longrightarrow}& S
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{e \wedge id}}\downarrow
    \\
    E \wedge S
  }
  \,.
$$

By example \ref{TensoringWithUnitOfRingSpectrumIsMonomorphismOfSpectra} here the vertical morphism is an $E$-monomorphism, and so by assumption there is a lift

$$
  \array{
    S &\stackrel{id}{\longrightarrow}& S
    \\
    \downarrow & \nearrow
    \\
    E \wedge S
  }
$$

which exhibits $S$ as a retract of $E \wedge S$.

In the other direction, given a retraction $S \stackrel{\overset{r}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{s}{\longrightarrow}} E \wedge X$ we show that there exist extensions in

$$
  \array{
    A &\stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow} & S
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow 
    \\
    B
  }
$$

whenever the vertical morphism is an $E$-monomorphism. To see this, complete the extension problem to the following [[commuting diagram]]

$$
  \array{
    A &&& \stackrel{e \wedge id}{\longrightarrow} &&& E \wedge A
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow &\searrow^{\mathrlap{g}} & &&  & {}^{\mathllap{{\mu \wedge id} \atop {\circ id \wedge s g }}}\swarrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{id \wedge f}}
    \\
    && S &\stackrel{r}{\longleftarrow}& E \wedge X
    \\
    \downarrow && &&  && \downarrow
    \\
    B &&& \stackrel{e \wedge id}{\longrightarrow} &&& E \wedge B
  }
  \,.
$$

Now, since $f$ is assumed to be an $E$-monomorphism, the morphism $Eid\wedge f$ on the right is a monomorphism in the sense of def. \ref{ExactSequences}, and so by lemma \ref{CharacterizationOfEpiMonomorphismsOfSpectra} there exists an extension $h$ in 

$$
  \array{
    A &&& \stackrel{e \wedge id}{\longrightarrow} &&& E \wedge A
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{f}}\downarrow &\searrow^{\mathrlap{g}} & &&  & {}^{\mathllap{{\mu \wedge id} \atop {\circ id \wedge s g }}}\swarrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{id \wedge f}}
    \\
    && S &\stackrel{r}{\longleftarrow}& E \wedge X
    \\
    \downarrow && &&  &\nwarrow^{\mathrlap{h}}& \downarrow
    \\
    B &&& \stackrel{e \wedge id}{\longrightarrow} &&& E \wedge B
  }
  \,.
$$

By composition and commutativity, this gives the required extension of $g$ along $f$.

###### Proposition

Given two $E$-Adams towers, def. \ref{EAdamsTower}, for some $X$, then the corresponding two $E$-Adams spectral sequences, def. \ref{EAdamsSpectralSequence}, are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] from the $\mathcal{E}_2$-page on

=--


#### The first page and Hopf algebroids

Due to prop. \ref{UniquenessOfEAdamsSpectralSequence}, 
for understanding the $\mathcal{E}_2$-page of any $E$-Adams spectral sequence, def. \ref{EAdamsSpectralSequence}, 
it is sufficient to understand the $\mathcal{E}_1$-page 
of the $E$-Adams spectral sequence that is induced by the
standard $E$-resolution of example \ref{StandardEResolution}.
By construction, that page is 

$$
  \mathcal{E}_1^{s,\bullet}
    \simeq
  \pi_\bullet(\;[Y,E^{\wedge (s+1)}\wedge X] \;)
$$

with the differentials being the image under $\pi_\bullet$ of the alternating sum of the morphisms that insert unit elements. 

We discuss now how, under favorable conditions, these homotopy groups of mapping spectra of the form $[Y,E^{\wedge (s+1)}\wedge X]$ may alternatively be computed as morphisms of $E$-[[generalized homology|homology]] equipped with suitable [[comodule]] structure over a [[Hopf algebroid]] structure on the dual $E$-[[Steenrod operations]] $E_\bullet(E)$. Then [below](#TheE2TermOfTheEAdamsSpectralSequence) we discuss that, as a result, the $d_1$-homology of the $\mathcal{E}_1$-page is seen to compute the [[Ext]]-groups from the $E$-homology of $Y$ to the $E$-homology of $X$, regarded as $E_\bullet(E)$-comodules. This re-formulation of the $\mathcal{E}_2$-page is the one that makes it be useful for computations.

The first condition needed for this to work is the following.

+-- {: .num_defn #FlatE}
###### Definition

Call the [[commutative ring spectrum]] $E$ _flat_ if one, equivalently both, of the morphisms

$$
  \eta_L \coloneqq \pi_\bullet(e \wedge id) 
  \;\colon\; 
  E_\bullet \longrightarrow E_\bullet(E)
$$

$$
  \eta_r

The key consequence of the assumption that $E$ is flat in the sense of def. \ref{FlatE} is the following.

+-- {: .num_prop #FlatnessOfEImpliesKeyConsequence}
###### Proposition

If $E$ is flat, def. \ref{FlatE}, then for all spectra $X$ there is a [[natural isomorphisms]]

$$
  E_\bullet(E) \otimes_{\pi_\bullet(E)} E_\bullet(X)
    \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}
  \pi_\bullet(E \wedge E \wedge X)
$$

and hence for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ there are isomorphisms

$$
  \pi_\bullet(E^{\wedge^{(n+2)}}\wedge X  )
    \simeq
  \underset{n+1\,factors}{
  \underbrace{E_\bullet(E)
    \otimes_{\pi_\bullet(E)}
    \cdots
    \otimes_{\pi_\bullet(E)}
  E_\bullet(E)
  }}
    \otimes_{\pi_\bullet(E)}
  E_\bullet(X)

=--

(e.g. [Adams 74, part III, lemma 12.5](#Adams74), [Schwede 12, prop. 6.20](#Schwede12))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The desired natural homomorphism

$$
  E_\bullet(E) \otimes_{\pi_\bullet(E)} E_\bullet(X)
  \longrightarrow
  \pi_\bullet(E \wedge E \wedge X)
$$

is given on $[\alpha] \in \pi_\bullet(E \wedge E)$ and $[\beta] \in \pi_\bullet(E \wedge X)$ by $([\alpha, \beta])\mapsto [(id \wedge \mu \wedge id) \circ (\alpha \wedge \beta)]$.

To see that this is an isomorphism, observe that by flatness of $E$, the assignment $X \mapsto E_\bullet(E) \otimes_{\pi_\bullet(E)} E_\bullet(-)$ is a [[generalized homology]] functor, hence [[Brown representability theorem|represented]] by some spectrum. The above morphism, natural in $X$, thus constitutes a homomorphism  of generalized homology theories. By the [Whitehead theorem for generalized homology](generalized+Eilenberg-Steenrod+cohomology#WhiteheadTheorem) for this to be an isomorphism it is sufficient to check that it induces isomorphisms on the point. This is manifestly the case.

Finally we get the claimed isomorphisms for all $n$ by [[induction]]:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \pi_\bullet(E^{\wedge^{n+2}} \wedge X)
    & \simeq
    \pi_\bullet(E \wedge E \wedge E^{\wedge^n} \wedge X))

We unwind def. \ref{CommutativeHopfAlgebroid}.  For $R \in CRing$, write $Spec(R)$ for same same object, but regarded as an object in $CRing^{op}$. 

An [[internal category]] in $CRing^{op}$ is a [[diagram]] in $CRing^{op}$ of the form

$$
  \array{
    Spec(\Gamma) \underset{Spec(A)}{\times} Spec(\Gamma)

    \\
    Spec(A)

$$

(where the [[fiber product]] at the top is over $s$ on the left and $t$ on the right) such that the pairing $\circ$ defines an [[associativity law|associative]] [[composition]] over $Spec(A)$, [[unitality|unital]] with respect to $i$. This is an [[internal groupoid]] if it is furthemore equipped with a morphism

$$
  inv \;\colon\; Spec(\Gamma) \longrightarrow Spec(\Gamma)
$$

acting as assigning [[inverses]] with respect to $\circ$.

The key basic fact to use now is that [[tensor product]] of commutative rings exhibits the [[cartesian monoidal category]] structure on $CRing^{op}$, see at _[CRing -- Properties -- Cocartesian comonoidal structure](CRing#CocartesianComnonoidalStructure)_:

$$
  Spec(R_1) \underset{Spec(R_3)}{\times} Spec(R_2) 
  \simeq
  Spec(R_1 \otimes_{R_3} R_2)

###### Remark

Generally, in a commutative Hopf algebroid, def. \ref{CommutativeHopfAlgebroid}, the two morphisms $\eta_L, \eta_R\colon A \to \Gamma$ from remark \ref{CommutativeHopfAlgebroidSpelledOut} need not coincide, they make $\Gamma$ genuinely into a [[bimodule]] over $A$, and it is the [[tensor product]] of [[bimodules]] that appears in remark \ref{CommutativeHopfAlgebroidSpelledOut}. But it may happen that they coincide:

An [[internal groupoid]] $\mathcal{G}_1 \stackrel{\overset{s}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{t}{\longrightarrow}}$ for which the [[domain]] and [[codomain]] morphisms coincide, $s = t$, is euqivalently a [[group object]] in the [[slice category]] over $\mathcal{G}_0$.

Dually, a [[commutative Hopf algebroid]] $\Gamma \stackrel{\overset{\eta_L}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{\eta_R}{\longleftarrow}} A$ for which $\eta_L$ and $\eta_R$ happen to coincide is equivalently a commutative [[Hopf algebra]] $\Gamma$ over $A$.

###### Theorem

If $E$ is flat, def. \ref{FlatE}, and satisfies the conditions of prop. \ref{AdamsUCT}, and $E_\bullet(Y)$ a [[projective module]] over $\pi_\bullet(E)$, then the entries of the $\mathcal{E}_2$-page
of any $E$-Adams spectral sequence, def. \ref{EAdamsSpectralSequence}, for $[Y,X]$ are the [[Ext]]-groups of [[commutative Hopf algebroid]]-[[comodules]] for the [[commutative Hopf algebroid]] structure on $E$-operations $E_\bullet(E)$ from prop.  \ref{HopfAlgebroidStructureOnDualEOperations}:

###### Proof

By prop. \ref{UniquenessOfEAdamsSpectralSequence} it is sufficient to show this for the standard $E$-Adams resolution of prop. \ref{StandardAdamsResolutionIsIndeedAdamsResolution}. 
For that case the $\mathcal{E}_1$ page is given by prop. \ref{E1PageOfStandardEAdamsSpectralSequenceIsEBarComplex}, and so by the standard theory of [[derived functors in homological algebra]] (see the section _[Via acyclic resolutions](derived+functor+in+homological+algebra#ViaAcyclicResolutions)_), it is now sufficient to see that:

1. the category $E_\bullet(E) CoMod$ is an [[abelian category]];

1. the graded chain complex of prop. \ref{E1PageOfStandardEAdamsSpectralSequenceIsEBarComplex} is the image under the [[hom-functor]] $F \coloneqq Hom_{E_\bullet(E)}(E_\bullet(Y),-)$ of an $F$-[[acyclic resolution]] of $E_\bullet(X)$.

These two statements are prop. \ref{CategoryOfHopfComodulesIsAbelianIfHopfAlgebroidIsFlat} and lemma \ref{CoFreeHopfComodulesAreHomNAcyclicForProjectiveN} below.

We now discuss the relevant general aspects of [[homological algebra]] in [[categories]] of [[comodules]] over [[commutative Hopf algebroids]] needed for the proof of theorem \ref{SecondPageOfEAdamsSpectralSequence} from prop. \ref{E1PageOfStandardEAdamsSpectralSequenceIsEBarComplex}.

+-- {: .num_prop #CategoryOfHopfComodulesIsAbelianIfHopfAlgebroidIsFlat}
###### Proposition

If a [[commutative Hopf algebroid]] $\Gamma$ over $A$, def. \ref{CommutativeHopfAlgebroid}, \ref{CommutativeHopfAlgebroidDefinitionInExplicitComponents} is such that $\eta_L, \eta_R \colon A \longrightarrow \Gamma$ is a [[flat morphism]], then the [[category]] $\Gamma CoMod$ of [[comodules]] over $\Gamma$, def. \ref{CommutativeHopfAlgebroidComodule}, is an [[abelian category]].

=--

(e.g. [Ravenel 86, theorem A1.1.3](#Ravenel86)) 

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

It is clear that, without any condition the Hopf algebroid, $\Gamma CoMod$ is an [[additive category]]. 

We need to show that with the assumption that $\Gamma$ is flat over $A$, then this is also a [[pre-abelian category]] in that [[kernels]] and [[cokernels]] exist. Let $f \colon (N_1,\Psi_{N_1}) \longrightarrow (N_2,\Psi_{N_2})$ be a morphism of comodules, hence a [[commuting diagram]] in $A$[[Mod]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    N_1 &\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}& N_2
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\Psi_{N_1}}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\Psi_{N_2}}}
    \\
    \Gamma \otimes_A N_1
    &\stackrel{id_\Gamma \otimes_A f}{\longrightarrow}&
    \Gamma \otimes_A N_2
  }
  \,.
$$

Consider the kernel $ker(f)$ of $f$ in $A$[[Mod]] and its image under $\Gamma \otimes_A (-)$

$$
  \array{
    ker(f) &\longrightarrow& N_1 &\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}& N_2
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\Psi_{N_1}}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\Psi_{N_2}}}
    \\
    \Gamma \otimes_A ker(f) 
      &\longrightarrow& 
    \Gamma \otimes_A N_1
      &\stackrel{id_\Gamma \otimes_A f}{\longrightarrow}&
    \Gamma \otimes_A N_2
  }
  \,.
$$

By the assumption that $\Gamma$ is a [[flat module]] over $A$, also $\Gamma \otimes_A ker(f) \simeq ker(\Gamma \otimes_A f)$ is a [[kernel]]. By its [[universal property]] this induces uniquely a morphism as shown on the left, making the above [[commuting diagram|diagram commute]]. This means that the $A$-module $ker(f)$ uniquely inherits the structure of a $\Gamma$-comodule such as to make $ker(f) \to N_1$ a comodule homomorphism. By the same universal property it follows that $ker(f)$ with this comodule structure is in fact the kernel of $f$ in $\Gamma CoMod$.

The argument for the existence of [[cokernels]] proceeds [[formal dual|formally dually]]. Therefore it follows that the comparison morphism

$$
  coker(ker(f)) \longrightarrow ker(coker(f))
$$

formed in $\Gamma CoMod$ has underlying it the corresponding comparison morphism in $A Mod$. There this is an [[isomorphism]], hence it is an isomorphism also in $\Gamma CoMod$, and so the latter is not just a [[pre-abelian category]] but in fact an [[abelian category]] itself.

###### Proposition

If a [[commutative Hopf algebroid]] $\Gamma$ over $A$, def. \ref{CommutativeHopfAlgebroid}, \ref{CommutativeHopfAlgebroidDefinitionInExplicitComponents} is such that $\eta_L, \eta_R \colon A \longrightarrow \Gamma$ is a [[flat morphism]], then 

1. every co-free $\Gamma$-[[comodule]], def. \ref{CoFreeComodules}, on an [[injective module]] over $A$ is an [[injective object]] in $\Gamma CoMod$;

1. $\Gamma CoMod$ has [[enough injectives]] (if the [[axiom of choice]] holds in the ambient [[set theory]]).

=--

(e.g. [Ravenel 86, lemma A1.2.2](#Ravenel86))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First of all, assuming the [[axiom of choice]], then the [[category of modules]] $A Mod$ has [[enough injectives]] (see [this proposition](injective+object#AbHasEnoughInjectives)).
Now by prop. \ref{CoFreeComodules} we have the [[adjunction]]

$$
  \Gamma CoMod
   \stackrel{\overset{co-free}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{forget}{\longrightarrow}}
  A Mod
 \,.
$$

Observe that the [[left adjoint]] is a [[faithful functor]] (being a [[forgetful functor]]) and that, by the proof of prop. \ref{CategoryOfHopfComodulesIsAbelianIfHopfAlgebroidIsFlat}, it is an [[exact functor]]. With this a standard lemma applies ([here](injective+object#TransferOfEnoughInjectivesAlongAdjunctions)) which says that

1. with $I \in A Mod$ an [[injective module]], then the co-free comodule $\Gamma \otimes_A I$ is an [[injective object]] in $\Gamma CoMod$;

1. for $N \in \Gamma CoMod$ any object, and for $i \colon U(N) \hookrightarrow I$ a monomorphism of $A$-modules into an injective $A$-module, then the [[adjunct]] $\tilde i \colon N \hookrightarrow \Gamma\otimes_A I$ is a monomorphism in $\Gamma CoMod$ (and into an injective comodule).

=--


+-- {: .num_lemma #CoFreeHopfComodulesAreHomNAcyclicForProjectiveN}
###### Lemma

Let $\Gamma$ be a [[commutative Hopf algebroid]] over $A$, def. \ref{CommutativeHopfAlgebroid}, \ref{CommutativeHopfAlgebroidDefinitionInExplicitComponents}, such that $\eta_L, \eta_R \colon A \longrightarrow \Gamma$ is a [[flat morphism]], 
Let $N \in \Gamma CoMod$ be a Hopf [[comodule]], def. \ref{CommutativeHopfAlgebroidComodule}, such that the underlying $A$-module is a [[projective module]] (a [[projective object]] in $A$[[Mod]]). 

Then  (assuming the [[axiom of choice]]) every co-free commodule, prop. \ref{CoFreeComodules}, is an $F$-[[acyclic object]] for $F$ the [[hom functor]] $Hom_{\Gamma CoMod}(N,-)$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We need to show that the [[derived functors in homological algebra|derived functors]] $R^{\bullet} Hom_{\Gamma}(N,-)$ vanish in positive degree on all co-free comodules, hence on $\Gamma \otimes_A K$, for $K \in A Mod$. 

To that end, let $I^\bullet$ be an [[injective resolution]] of $K$ in $A Mod$. By prop. \ref{CategoryOfHopfComodulesIsAbelianIfHopfAlgebroidIsFlat} then $\Gamma \otimes_A I^\bullet$ is a sequence of [[injective objects]] in $\Gamma CoMod$ and by the assumption that $\Gamma$ is flat over $A$ it is an [[injective resolution]] of $\Gamma \otimes_A K$ in $\Gamma CoMod$. Therefore the derived functor in question is given by

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    R^{\bullet \geq 1} Hom_\Gamma(N, \Gamma \otimes_A K)
    & \simeq
    H_{\bullet \geq 1}( Hom_\Gamma( N, \Gamma \otimes_A I^\bullet ) )
    \\
    & \simeq H_{\bullet \geq 1}( Hom_A(N, I^\bullet) )
    \\
    & \simeq 0
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

Here the second equivalence is the cofree/forgetful adjunction isomorphism of prop. \ref{CoFreeComodules}, while the last equality then follows from the assumption that the $A$-module underlying $N$ is a [[projective module]] (since [[hom functors]] out of [[projective objects]] are [[exact functors]] ([here](projective+object#EquivalenceOfDefinitionsInAbelian)) and since derived functors of exact functors vanish in positive degree ([here](derived+functor+in+homological+algebra#DerivedFunctorOfExactFunctor))).


=--

With lemma \ref{CoFreeHopfComodulesAreHomNAcyclicForProjectiveN} the proof of theorem \ref{SecondPageOfEAdamsSpectralSequence} is completed.

**Abstract.** _The [[(infinity,1)-category|category]] of [[generalized cohomology theories]] equipped with a universal "[[complex oriented cohomology theory|complex]] [[orientation in generalized cohomology|orientation]]" happens to unify within it the abstract structure theory of [[stable homotopy theory]] with the concrete richness of the [[differential topology]] of [[cobordism theory]] and of the [[arithmetic geometry]] of [[formal group laws]] (of [[higher Jacobians]]), such as [[elliptic curves]]. In the seminar we work through classical results in [[algebraic topology]], organized such as to give in the end a first glimpse of the modern picture of [[chromatic homotopy theory]]._


**Literature.** ([Kochman 96](#Kochman96)).


**Outline.** We start with two classical topics of [[algebraic topology]] that first run independently in parallel:

* [S.1) Generalized cohomology](#S1GeneralizedCohomology)

* [S.2) Cobordism theory](#S2CobordismTheory)

The development of either of these happens to give rise to the concept of _[[spectra]]_ and via this concept it turns out that both topics are intimately related. The unification of both is our third topic

* [S.3) Complex oriented cohomology](#ComplexOrientedCohomologyTheory)

$\,$


### **S.1)** Generalized cohomology
 {#S1GeneralizedCohomology}

**Idea.** The concept that makes [[algebraic topology]] be about methods of [[homological algebra]] applied to [[topology]] is that of [[generalized homology]] and [[generalized cohomology]]: these are [[covariant functors]] or [[contravariant functors]], respectively,

$$
  Spaces \longrightarrow Ab^{\mathbb{Z}}
$$

from (sufficiently nice) [[topological spaces]] to $\mathbb{Z}$-[[graded abelian groups]], such that a few key properties of the [[homotopy types]] of topological spaces is preserved as one passes them from [[Ho(Top)]] to the much more tractable [[abelian category]] [[Ab]].

**Literature.** ([Aguilar-Gitler-Prieto 02, chapters 7,8 and 12](#AguilarGitlerPrieto02), [Kochman 96, 3.4, 4.2](#Kochman96), [Schwede 12, II.6](#Schwede12)) 


#### Generalized cohomology functors
 {#GeneralizedHomologyAndCohomologyFunctors}

**Idea.** A [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] theory is such a contravariant functor which satisfies the key properties exhibited by [[ordinary cohomology]] (as computed for instance by [[singular cohomology]]), notably [[homotopy invariance]] and [[excision]], _except_ that its value on the point is not required to be concentrated in degree 0. Dually for [[generalized homology]]. There are two versions of the axioms, one for [[reduced cohomology]], and while not quite equivalent, they are closely related.

An important example of a generalised cohomology theory other than [[ordinary cohomology]] is [[topological K-theory]]. The other two examples of key relevance below are [[cobordism cohomology]] and [[stable cohomotopy]].

**Literature.** ([Aguilar-Gitler-Prieto 02, section 12 and section 9](#AguilarGitlerPrieto02), [Kochman 96, 3.4](#Kochman96)).



#### Brown representability theorem
 {#BrownRepresentabilityTheorem}


**Idea.** Given any [[functor]] such as the generalized (co)homology functor [above](#GeneralizedHomologyAndCohomologyFunctors), an important question to ask is whether it is a _[[representable functor]]_. Due to the $\mathbb{Z}$-grading and the [[suspension isomorphisms]], if a generalized (co)homology functor is representable at all, it must be represented by a $\mathbb{Z}$-indexed sequence of [[pointed topological spaces]] such that the [[reduced suspension]] of one is comparable to the next one in the list. This is a _[[spectrum]]_.

Whitehead observed that indeed every [[spectrum]] represents a generalized (co)homology theory.  The _[[Brown representability theorem]]_ states that, conversely, every generalized (co)homology theory is represented by a spectrum.

As a first application, [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectra]] representing [[ordinary cohomology]] may be characterized via Brown representability.

Due to [[phantom maps]], there remains a subtle difference between generalized (co)homology functors and the spectra which represent them: a little bit of information is lost as one passes from the spectrum to its cohomology functor (the [[Yoneda lemma]] does not fully apply here, since a (co)homology functor is equipped with the extra structure of the [[natural isomorphism|natural]] [[suspension isomorphism]]).

In applications and modern theory, it is mostly the spectra that matter, and hence the Brown representability theory is used to transfer extra structure on spectra to extra structure on cohomology theories. For instance a _[[multiplicative cohomology theory]]_ is one which is represented by a [[ring spectrum]].

There is a slight refinement of the concept of generalized homology functors to that of "[[excisive ∞-functors]]". These are fully equivalent to spectra.

**Literature.** ([Aguilar-Gitler-Prieto 02, section 12](#AguilarGitlerPrieto02), [Kochman 96, 3.4](#Kochman96))

$\,$

The [classical formulation](#ClassicalFormulation) of Brown representability is only superficially concerned with [[topological spaces]]. Instead, via the [[classical model structure on topological spaces]], one finds that the statement only concerns the [[simplicial localization]] of [[Top]] at the [[weak homotopy equivalences]], hence the [[(∞,1)-category]] $L_{whe} Top\simeq $ [[∞Grpd]].

We discuss now the natural formulation of the Brown representability theorem for functors out of [[homotopy categories of (∞,1)-categories]] following ([Lurie, section 1.4.1](#LurieHigherAlgebra)). See also the exposition in ([Mathew 11](Brown+representability+theorem#Mathew11)).

And of course they are [[compact object in an (∞,1)-category|compact objects]]. 

So while $\{S^n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ generates all of $\infty Grpd^{\ast/}$, the latter is _not_ an example of def. \ref{CompactGenerationByCogroupObjects} due to the failure of $S^0$ to have [[cogroup]] structure.

Removing that generator, the $(\infty,1)$-category generated by $\{S^n\}_{{n \in \mathbb{N}} \atop {n \geq 1}}$ is $\infty Grpd^{\ast/}_{\geq 1}$, that of _[[connected object|connected]]_ [[pointed homotopy types]].

In an $(\infty,1)$-category compactly generated by cogroup objects $\{S_i\}_{i \in I}$ closed under forming suspensions, according to def. \ref{CompactGenerationByCogroupObjects}, a morphism $f\colon X \longrightarrow Y$ is an [[equivalence in an (infinity,1)-category|equivalence]] precisely if for each $i \in I$ the induced function of maps in the [[homotopy category of an (infinity,1)-category|homotopy category]]

$$

is an [[isomorphism]] (a [[bijection]]).

([Lurie, p. 114, Lemma star](#LurieHigherAlgebra))

+-- {: .proof }
###### Proof

By the [[(∞,1)-Yoneda lemma]], the morphism $f$ is an [[equivalence in an (∞,1)-category|equivalence]] precisely if for all objects $A \in \mathcal{C}$  the induced morphism 

$$
  \mathcal{C}(A,f)
  \;\colon\;
  \mathcal{C}(A,X)
   \longrightarrow
  \mathcal{C}(A,Y)
$$

is an equivalence in [[∞Grpd]]. By assumption of compact generation and since the hom-functor $\mathcal{C}(-,-)$ sends $\infty$-colimits in the first argument to $\infty$-limits, this is the case precisely already if it is the case for $A \in \{S_i\}_{i \in I}$.

Now by the standard [[Whitehead theorem]] in [[∞Grpd]] (being a [[hypercomplete (∞,1)-topos]]), the morphisms

$$
  \mathcal{C}(S_i,f)
  \;\colon\;
  \mathcal{C}(S_i,X)
   \longrightarrow
  \mathcal{C}(S_i,Y)

in [[∞Grpd]] are  [[equivalence in an (∞,1)-category|equivalences]] precisely if they are [[weak homotopy equivalences]], hence precisely if they induce [[isomorphisms]] on all [[homotopy group]] $\pi_n$ for **all basepoints**.

It is this last condition of testing on all basepoints that the assumed [[cogroup]] structure on the $S_i$ allows to do away with: this cogroup structure implies that $\mathcal{C}(S_i,-)$ has the structure of an $H$-group, and this implies (by group multiplication), that all [[connected components]] have the same homotopy groups, hence that all homotopy groups are independent of the choice of basepoint, up to isomorphism.

Therefore the above morphisms are equivalences precisely if they are so under applying $\pi_n$ based on the connected component of the [[zero morphism]]

  \,.
$$

Now in this pointed situation we may use that 

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \pi_n \mathcal{C}(-,-) & \simeq \pi_0 \mathcal{C}(-,\Omega^n(-)) 
    \\
    & \simeq \pi_0\mathcal{C}(\Sigma^n(-),-)
    \\
    & \simeq Ho(\mathcal{C})(\Sigma^n(-),-)

to find that $f$ is an equivalence in $\mathcal{C}$ precisely if the induced morphisms

$$
  Ho(\mathcal{C})(\Sigma^n S_i, f)
    \;\colon\;
  Ho(\mathcal{C})(\Sigma^n S_i,X)
    \longrightarrow
  Ho(\mathcal{C})(\Sigma^n S_i,Y)
$$

are isomorphisms for all $i \in I$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

Finally by the assumption that each suspension $\Sigma^n S_i$ of a generator is itself among the set of generators, the claim follows.

=--

([Lurie, theorem 1.4.1.2](#LurieHigherAlgebra))

+-- {: .proof #ProofFollowingLurie}
###### Proof


Due to the version of the Whitehead theorem of prop. \ref{WhiteheadTheoremForCompactGenerationByCogroupObjects} we are essentially reduced to showing that [[Brown functors]] $F$ are representable on the $S_i$. To that end consider the following lemma.
(In the following we notationally identify, via the [[Yoneda lemma]], objects of $\mathcal{C}$, hence of $Ho(\mathcal{C})$, with the functors they [[representable functor|represent]].)

Lemma ($\star$): _Given $X \in \mathcal{C}$ and $\eta \in F(X)$, hence $\eta \colon X \to F$, then there exists a morphism $f \colon X \to X'$ and an [[extension]] $\eta' \colon X' \to F$ of $\eta$ which induces for each $S_i$ a [[bijection]] $\eta'\circ (-) \colon Ho(\mathcal{C})(S_i,X') \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} Ho(\mathcal{C})(S_i,F) \simeq F(S_i)$._

To see this, first notice that we may directly find an extension $\eta_0$ along a map $X\to X_o$ such as to make a [[surjection]]: simply take $X_0$ to be the [[coproduct]] of **all** possible elements in the codomain and take

$$
  \eta_0
  \;\colon\;
   X 
     \sqcup
   \left(
     \underset{{i \in I,} \atop {\gamma \colon S_i \stackrel{}{\to} F}}{\coprod} 
     S_i
   \right)
   \longrightarrow
   F
$$

to be the canonical map. (Using that $F$, by assumption, turns coproducts into products, we may indeed treat the coproduct in $\mathcal{C}$ on the left as the coproduct of the corresponding functors.)

To turn the surjection thus constructed into a bijection, we now successively form quotients of $X_0$. To that end proceed by [[induction]] and suppose that $\eta_n \colon X_n \to F$ has been constructed. Then for $i \in I$ let

$$
  K_i 
    \coloneqq 
  ker
  \left( 
     Ho(\mathcal{C})(S_i, X_n) 
        \stackrel{\eta_n \circ (-)}{\longrightarrow} 
     F(S_i) 
   \right)
$$

be the [[kernel]] of  $\eta_n$ evaluated on $S_i$. These $K_i$ are the pieces that need to go away in order to make a bijection. Hence define $X_{n+1}$ to be their joint [[homotopy cofiber]]

$$
  X_{n+1} 
     \coloneqq 
   coker\left(
     \left(
        \underset{{i \in I,} \atop {\gamma \in K_i}}{\sqcup} S_i
     \right)
     \longrightarrow
     X_n
  \right)
  \,.
$$

Then by the assumption that $F$ takes this homotopy kernel to a weak fiber, there exists an extension $\eta_{n+1}$ of $\eta_n$ along $X_n \to X_{n+1}$. 

It is now clear that we want to take

$$
  X' \coloneqq \underset{\rightarrow}{\lim}_n X_n
$$

and extend all the $\eta_n$ to that colimit. Since we have no condition for evaluating $F$ on colimits other than pushouts, observe that this [[sequential colimit]] is equivalent to the following pushout:

$$
  \array{
    \underset{n}{\sqcup} X_n
    &\longrightarrow& \underset{n}{\sqcup} X_{2n}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \underset{n}{\sqcup} X_{2n+1} &\longrightarrow& X'
  }
  \,,
$$

where the components of the top and left map alternate between the identity on $X_n$ and the above successor maps $X_n \to X_{n+1}$.
Now the excision property of $F$ applies to this pushout, and we conclude the desired  extension $\eta' \colon X' \to F$.

It remains to confirm that this indeed  gives the desired bijection. Surjectivity is clear. For injectivity use that all the $S_i$ are, by assumption, [[compact object|compact]], hence they may be taken inside the [[sequential colimit]].With this, injectivity follows because by construction we quotiented out the kernel at each stage.

This concludes the proof of Lemma ($\star$).

Now apply the construction given by this lemma to the case 
$X_0 \coloneqq 0$ and the unique $\eta_0 \colon 0 \stackrel{\exists !}{\to} F$. Lemma $(\star)$ then produces an object $X'$ which represents $F$ on all the $S_i$, and we want to show that this $X'$ actually represents $F$ generally, hence that for every $Y \in \mathcal{C}$ the function

$$
  \theta \coloneqq \eta'\circ (-)
  \;\colon\;
  Ho(\mathcal{C})(Y,X')
   \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}
  F(Y)
$$

is a [[bijection]].

First, to see that $\theta$ is surjective, we need to find a preimage of any $\rho \colon Y \to F$. Applying Lemma $(\star)$ to $(\eta',\rho)\colon X'\sqcup Y \longrightarrow F$ we get an extension $\kappa$ of this through some $X' \sqcup Y \longrightarrow Z$ and the morphism on the right of the following commuting diagram:

$$
  \array{
    Ho(\mathcal{C})(-,X') && \longrightarrow && Ho(\mathcal{C})(-, Z)
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{\eta'\circ(-)}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\kappa \circ (-)}}
    \\
    && F(-)
  }
  \,.
$$

Moreover, Lemma $(\star)$ gives that evaluated on all $S_i$, the two diagonal morphisms here become isomorphisms. But then prop. \ref{WhiteheadTheoremForCompactGenerationByCogroupObjects} implies that $X' \longrightarrow Z$ is in fact an equivalence. Hence the component map $Y \to Z \simeq Z$ is a lift of $\kappa$ through $\theta$.

Second, to see that $\theta$ is injective, suppose $f,g \colon Y \to X'$ have the same image under $\theta$. Then consider their [[homotopy pushout]]

$$
  \array{
    Y \sqcup Y &\stackrel{(f,g)}{\longrightarrow}& X'
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    Y &\longrightarrow& Z
  }
$$
 
along the [[codiagonal]] of $Y$. Using that $F$ sends this to a [[weak pullback]] by assumption, we obtain an extension $\bar \eta$ of $\eta'$ along $X' \to Z$. Applying Lemma $(\star)$ to this gives a further extension $\bar \eta' \colon Z' \to Z$ which now makes the following diagram

$$
  \array{
    Ho(\mathcal{C})(-,X') && \longrightarrow && Ho(\mathcal{C})(-, Z)
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{\eta'\circ(-)}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\bar \eta' \circ (-)}}
    \\
    && F(-)
  }
$$

such that the diagonal maps become isomorphisms when evaluated on the $S_i$. As before, it follows via prop. \ref{WhiteheadTheoremForCompactGenerationByCogroupObjects} that the morphism
$h \colon X' \longrightarrow Z'$ is an equivalence.

Since by this construction $h\circ f$ and $h\circ g$ are homotopic

$$
  \array{
    Y \sqcup Y &\stackrel{(f,g)}{\longrightarrow}& X'
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow & \searrow^{\mathrlap{\stackrel{h}{\simeq}}}
    \\
    Y &\longrightarrow& Z &\longrightarrow& Z'
  }
$$

it follows with $h$ being an equivalence that already $f$ and $g$ were homotopic, hence that they represented the same element.

#### Milnor exact sequence
 {#S2MilnorExactSequence}


**Idea.** One tool for computing [[generalized cohomology]] [[cohomology groups|groups]] via "[[inverse limits]]" are _[[Milnor exact sequences]]_. For instance the generalized cohomology of the [[classifying space]] $B U(1)$ plays a key role in the [[complex oriented cohomology]]-theory discussed [below](#ComplexOrientedCohomologyTheory), and via the equivalence $B U(1) \simeq \mathbb{C}P^\infty$ to the [[homotopy type]] of the infinite [[complex projective space]], which is the [[direct limit]] of finite dimensional projective spaces $\mathbb{C}P^n$, this is an [[inverse limit]] of the generalized cohomology groups of the $\mathbb{C}P^n$s. But what really matters here is the [[derived functor]] of the [[limit]]-operation -- the  [[homotopy limit]] -- and the [[Milnor exact sequence]] expresses how the naive limits receive corrections from higher "[[lim^1]]-terms". In practice one mostly proceeds by verifying conditions under which these corrections happen to disappear, these are the _[[Mittag-Leffler conditions]]_.

We need this for instance for the computation of [[Conner-Floyd Chern classes]] [below](#ConnerFloydChernClasses).

#### Serre-Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence
 {#SerreAtiyahHirzebruchSpectralSequence}

**Idea.** Another important tool for computing [[generalized cohomology]] is to reduce it to the computation of [[ordinary cohomology]] with [[coefficients]]. Given a [[generalized cohomology theory]] $E$, there is a [[spectral sequence]] known as the _[[Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence]]_ (AHSS) which serves to compute $E$-cohomology of $F$-[[fiber bundles]] over a [[simplicial complex]] $X$ in terms of [[ordinary cohomology]] with [[coefficients]] in the generalized cohomology $E^\bullet(F)$ of the fiber. For $E = $ [[HA]] this is known as the _[[Serre spectral sequence]]_.

The [[Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence]] in turn is a consequence of the "[[Cartan-Eilenberg spectral sequence]]" which arises from the [[exact couple]] of [[relative cohomology]] groups of the skeleta of the CW-complex, and whose first page is the relative cohomology groups for codimension-1 skeleta.

We need the AHSS for instance for the computation of [[Conner-Floyd Chern classes]] [below](#ConnerFloydChernClasses).

By assumption there is for each $(s,t)$ an $R$ such that for all $r \geq R$ then $ker(d_{r-1})$ is independent of $r$. 

Moreover, $im(d_{r-1})$ consists of the image under $h$ of those $x$ such that $g^{r-2}(x)$ is in the image of $f$, hence (by exactness of the exact couple) such that $g^{r-2}(x)$ is in the kernel of $g$, hence such that $x$ is in the kernel of $g^{r-1}$. If $r \gt R$ then by assumption $g^{r-1} = 0$ and so then $im(d_{r-1}) = im(h)$.

It follows that

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    E_\infty^{p,n-p}
    & =
    ker(d_R)/im(d_R)
    \\
    &
    \simeq
    f^{-1}(im(g^R))/im(h)
    \\
    &
    \simeq
    im(g^R) \cap im(f)
    \\
    & 
    \simeq
    im(g^R) \cap ker(g)
  \end{aligned}
$$

where in last two steps we used once more the exactness of the exact couple.

The last group is that of elements $x \in G^n$ which map to zero in $D^{p-1,n-p+1}$ and where two such are identified if they agree in $D^{p,n-p}$, hence indeed 

$$
  E_\infty^{p,n-p} \simeq F^p G^n / F^{p+1} G^n

###### Proposition
**(Serre-Cartan-Eilenberg-Whitehead-Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence)**

Let $A$ be a [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] functor such that $A^\bullet(\ast)$ is bounded below. Let $B$ be a [[simply connected topological space|simply connected]] finite [[CW-complex]] and let $X \stackrel{\pi}{\to} B$ be a [[fibration]] with fibers $F$. Then there is a cohomology spectral sequence, def. \ref{CohomologySpectralSequence} whose $E_2$-page is the [[ordinary cohomology]] of $B$ with [[coefficients]] in the $A$-[[generalized cohomology]] of the fiber, and which converges to the $A$-cohomology of the total space

$$
  E_2^{p,q} = 
  H^p(B, A^q(F)) \Rightarrow A^\bullet(X)
$$ 

with respect to the filtering given by

$$
  F^p A^\bullet(X) \coloneqq ker(A^\bullet(X) \to A^\bullet(X_{p-1}))
$$

where $X_{p} \coloneqq \pi^{-1}(B_{p})$ is the fiber over the $p$th stage of the [[CW-complex]] $B$.


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The [exactness axiom](generalized+%28Eilenberg-Steenrod%29+cohomology#ExactnessUnreduced) for $A$ gives an [[exact couple]], def. \ref{ExactCoupleAndDerivedExactCouple} of the form

$$
  \array{
    A^{s+t}(X_{s})
    &&
      \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow} 
    &&
    A^\bullet(X_{s})
    \\
    & \nwarrow && \swarrow
    \\
    && A^{s+t}(X_{s}, X_{s-1})
  }
$$

where we take $X_{\gg 1} = X$ and $X_{\lt 0} = \emptyset$. This immediately implies that the convergence conditions for the induced spectral sequence in prop. \ref{CohomologicalSpectralSequenceOfAnExactCouple} are met, so that we indeed have convergence to 

$$
  \lim\left(
    \cdots \stackrel{}{\to} A^\bullet(X_{s+1}) \longrightarrow A^\bullet(X_{s})
    \to \cdots
  \right)
  \simeq
  A^\bullet(X).
$$

In order to determine the $E_2$-page, we analyze the $E_1$-page:

Let $C(s)$ be the set of $s$-cells of $B$, and notice that for $\sigma \in C(s)$ then

$$
  (\pi^{-1}(\sigma), \pi^{-1}(\partial \sigma)) \simeq (D^n, S^{n-1}) \times F
  \,.
$$

This implies that 

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    E_1^{s,t}
    & \coloneqq
    A^{s+t}(X_s, X_{s-1})
    \\
    & \simeq \tilde A^{s+t}(X_s/X_{s-1})
    \\
    & \simeq \tilde A^{s+t}(\underset{\sigma \in C(n)}{\vee} S^s \wedge F_+)
    \\
    & \simeq \underset{\sigma \in C(s)}{\prod} \tilde A^{s+t}(S^s \wedge F_+)
    \\
    & \simeq \underset{\sigma \in C(s)}{\prod} \tilde A^t(F_+)
    \\
    & \simeq \underset{\sigma \in C(s)}{\prod} A^t(F)
    \\
    & \simeq C^n(B,A^t(F))
  \end{aligned}
  \,,
$$

where we used the relation to [[reduced cohomology]] $\tilde A$, and the [[wedge axiom]] and the [[suspension isomorphism]] of the latter. The last group is that of [[singular cohomology|singular cochains]] of degree $s$ on $B$ with [[coefficients]] in the group $A^t(F)$.

Hence to conclude it remains to show that on this group the differential $d_1$ coincides with the differential in the [[singular simplicial complex]]. This takes a tad of fiddling, see for instance ([Kochman 96, pages 124-125](#Kochman96)).

### **S.2)** Cobordism theory
 {#S2CobordismTheory}

**Idea.** As one passes from [[abelian groups]] to [[spectra]], a miracle happens: even though the latter are just the proper embodiment of [[linear algebra]] in the context of [[homotopy theory]] ("[[higher algebra]]") their inspection reveals that spectra natively know about deep phenomena of [[differential topology]], [[index theory]] and in fact [[string theory]] (for instance via a close relation between _[[genera and partition functions - table|genera and partition functions]]_). 

A strong manifestation of this phenomenon comes about in [[complex oriented cohomology theory]]/[[chromatic homotopy theory]] that we eventually come to [below](#ComplexOrientedCohomologyTheory). It turns out to be higher algebra over the complex Thom spectrum [[MU]]. 

Here we first concentrate on its real avatar, the [[Thom spectrum]] [[MO]]. The seminal result of [[Thom's theorem]] says that the [[stable homotopy groups]] of [[MO]] form the [[cobordism ring]] of [[cobordism]]-[[equivalence classes]] of [[manifolds]]. In the course of discussing this _[[cobordism theory]]_ one encounters various phenomena whose complex version also governs the complex oriented cohomology theory that we are interested in [below](#ComplexOrientedCohomologyTheory).

**Literature.** ([Kochman 96, chapter I and sections II.2, II6](Kochman96)). A quick efficient account is in ([Malkiewich 11](#Malkiewich11)). See also ([Aguilar-Gitler-Prieto 02, section 11](#AguilarGitlerPrieto02)).


#### Classifying spaces, $G$-Structure and Bordism
 {#ClassifyingSpaces}

**Idea.** Every [[manifold]] $X$ of [[dimension]] $n$ carries a canonical [[vector bundle]] of [[rank]] $n$: its [[tangent bundle]]. There is a [[universal vector bundle]] of rank $n$, of which all others arise by [[pullback]], up to [[isomorphism]]. The base space of this universal bundle is hence called the [[classifying space]] and denoted $B GL(n) \simeq B O(n)$ (for $O(n)$ the [[orthogonal group]]). This may be realized as the [[homotopy type]] of a [[direct limit]] of [[Grassmannian manifolds]]. In particular the tangent bundle of a manifold $X$ is classified by a map $X \longrightarrow B O(n)$, unique up to homotopy. For $G$ a [[subgroup]] of $O(n)$, then a lift of this map through the canonical map $B G \longrightarrow B O(n)$ of classifying spaces is a _[[G-structure]]_ on $X$

$$
  \array{
    && B G
    \\
    &\nearrow& \downarrow
    \\
    X &\longrightarrow& B O(n)
  }
$$ 

for instance an [[orientation]] for the inclusion $SO(n) \hookrightarrow O(n)$ of the [[special orthogonal group]], or an [[almost complex structure]] for the inclusion $U(n) \hookrightarrow O(2n)$ of the [[unitary group]].

All this generalizes, for instance from tangent bundles to [[normal bundles]] with respect to any [[embedding]]. It also behaves well with respect to passing to the [[boundary]] of manifolds, hence to [[bordism]]-classes of manifolds. This is what appears in [[Thom's theorem]] [below](#ThomTheorem).

**Literature.** ([Kochman 96, 1.3-1.4](#Kochman96))


#### Thom spectra
 {#ThomSpectra}
 
**Idea**. Given a [[vector bundle]] $V$ of rank $n$ over a [[compact topological space]], then its [[one-point compactification]] is equivalently the result of forming the bundle $D(V) \hookrightarrow V$ of unit [[n-balls]], and identifying with one single point all the boundary unit [[n-spheres]] $S(V)\hookrightarrow V$. Generally, this construction $Th(C) \coloneqq D(V)/S(V)$ is called the _[[Thom space]]_ of $V$. 

Thom spaces occur notably as codomains for would-be [[left inverses]] of [[embeddings]] of [[manifolds]] $X \hookrightarrow Y$. The _[[Pontrjagin-Thom collapse map]]_ $Y \to Th(N X)$ of such an embedding is a continuous function going the other way around, but landing not quite in $X$ but in the [[Thom space]] of the [[normal bundle]] of $X$ in $Y$. Composing this further with the classifying map of the [[normal bundle]] lands in the Thom space of the [[universal vector bundle]] over the [[classifying space]] $B O(k)$, denoted $M O(k)$. In particular in the case that $Y = S^n$ is an [[n-sphere]] (and every manifold embeds into a large enough $n$-sphere, see also at [[Whitney embedding theorem]]), the [[Pontryagin-Thom collapse map]] hence associates with every manifold an element of a [[homotopy group]] of a universal Thom space $M O(k)$.

This curious construction turns out to have excellent formal properties: as the dimension ranges, the universal Thom spaces arrange into a [[spectrum]], called the _[[Thom spectrum]]_, and the homotopy groups defined by the Pontryagin-Thom collapse pass along to the [[stable homotopy groups]] of this spectrum. 

Moreover, via [[Whitney sum]] of [[vector bundle]] the [[Thom spectrum]] naturally is a [[ring spectrum]], and under the Pontryagin-Thom collapse the [[Cartesian product]] of manifolds is compatible with this ring structure.

**Literature.** ([Kochman 96, 1.5](#Kochman96), [Schwede 12, chapter I exaple 1.16](#Schwede12))


#### Thom's theorem
 {#ThomTheorem}

**Idea.** By the [[Pontryagin-Thom collapse]] construction [above](#ThomSpectra), there is an assignment

$$
  n Manifolds \longrightarrow \pi_n(M O)
$$

which sends [[disjoint union]] and [[Cartesian product]] of manifolds to sum and product in the [[ring]] of [[stable homotopy groups]] of the [[Thom spectrum]]. One finds then that two manifolds map to the same element in $\pi_\bullet(M O)$ precisely if they are connected by a [[bordism]] as [above](#ClassifyingSpaces). The [[bordism]]-classes $\Omega_\bullet^O$ of manifolds  form a [[commutative ring]] under [[disjoint union]] and [[Cartesian product]], called the _[[bordism ring]]_, and hence Pontrjagin-Thom collapse produces a ring [[homomorphism]]

$$
  \Omega_\bullet^O \longrightarrow \pi_\bullet(M O)
  \,.
$$

[[Thom's theorem]] states that this homomorphism is an [[isomorphism]].

**Literature.** ([Kochman 96, 1.5](#Kochman96))


#### Thom isomorphism
 {#ThomIsomorphism}


**Idea.** If a [[vector bundle]] $E \stackrel{p}{\longrightarrow} X$ of [[rank]] $n$ carries a cohomology class $\omega \in H^n(Th(E),R)$  that looks fiberwise like a [[volume form]] -- a [[Thom class]] -- then the operation of pulling back from base space and then forming the [[cup product]] with this [[Thom class]] is an [[isomorphism]] on (reduced) cohomology

$$
  ( (-) \cup \omega) \circ p^\ast 
  \;\colon\;
  H^\bullet(X,R) \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} \tilde H^{\bullet+n}(Th(E),R)
  \,.
$$

This is the _[[Thom isomorphism]]_. It follow from the [[Serre spectral sequence]] (or else from the [[Leray-Hirsch theorem]]).

We need this below to compute (co)homology of universal Thom spectra $M U$ in terms of that of the [[classifying spaces]] $B U$.

Composed with pullback along the [[Pontryagin-Thom collapse map]], the Thom isomorphism produces maps in cohomology that covariantly follow the underlying maps of spaces. These "[[Umkehr maps]]" have the interpretation of [[fiber integration]] against the Thom class.


**Literature.** ([Kochman 96, 2.6](#Kochman96))



#### Orientation in generalized cohomology
 {#OrientationAndFiberIntegration}


**Idea.** From the way the [[Thom isomorphism]] via a [[Thom class]] works in [[ordinary cohomology]] (as [above](#ThomIsomorphism)), one sees what the general concept of [[orientation in generalized cohomology]] and of [[fiber integration in generalized cohomology]] is to be.

An important application is given by taking $E = $ [[KU]] to be [[topological K-theory]]. Then [[orientation in generalized cohomology|orientation]] is [[spin structure]] and fiber integration with coefficients in $E$ is [[fiber integration in K-theory]]. This is classical _[[index theory]]_.

**Literature.** ([Kochman 96, section 4.3](#Kochman96), [Adams 74, part III, section 10](#Adams74), [Lurie 10, lecture 5](#Lurie10))


$\,$

### **S.3)** Complex oriented cohomology
 {#ComplexOrientedCohomologyTheory}



**Idea.** Given the concept of [[orientation in generalized cohomology]] as [above](#OrientationAndFiberIntegration), it is clearly of interest to consider [[cohomology theories]] $E$ such that there exists an [[orientation in generalized cohomology|orientation]]/[[Thom class]] on the [[universal vector bundle]] over any [[classifying space]] $B G$ (or rather: on its induced [[spherical fibration]]), because then _all_ $G$-[[associated bundle|associated]] [[vector bundles]] inherit an orientation.

Considering this for $G = U(n)$ the [[unitary groups]] yields the concept of _[[complex oriented cohomology theory]]_. 

It turns out that a complex orientation on a generalized cohomology theory $E$ in this sense is already given by demanding that there is a suitable generalization of the [[first Chern class]] of [[complex line bundles]] in $E$-cohomology. By the [[splitting principle]], this already implies the existence of [[generalized Chern classes]] ([[Conner-Floyd Chern classes]]) of all degrees, and these are the required universal generalized [[Thom classes]].

Where the ordinary [[first Chern class]] in [[ordinary cohomology]] is simply additive under [[tensor product]] of [[complex line bundles]], one finds that the composite of generalized first Chern classes is instead governed by more general commutative [[formal group laws]]. This phenomenon governs much of the theory to follow.

**Literature.** ([Kochman 96, section 4.3](#Kochman96), [Lurie 10, lectures 1-10](#Lurie10), [Adams 74, Part I, Part II](#Adams74)).


#### Chern classes
 {#ChernClasses}

**Idea**. In particular [[ordinary cohomology]] [[HR]] is canonically a [[complex oriented cohomology theory]]. The behaviour of general [[Conner-Floyd Chern classes]] to be discussed [below](#ConnerFloydChernClasses) follows closely the behaviour of the ordinary [[Chern classes]]. 

An ordinary [[Chern class]] is a [[characteristic class]] of [[complex vector bundles]], and since there is the [[classifying space]] $B U$ of complex vector bundles, the _universal_ Chern classes are those of the [[universal complex vector bundle]] over the [[classifying space]] $B U$, which in turn are just the [[ordinary cohomology]] classes in $H^\bullet(B U)$

These may be computed inductively by iteratively applying to the [[spherical fibrations]]

$$
  S^{2n-1} \longrightarrow B U(n-1) \longrightarrow B U(n)
$$

the [[Thom-Gysin exact sequence]], a special case of the [[Serre spectral sequence]]. 

Pullback of Chern classes along the canonical map $(B U(1))^n \longrightarrow B U(n)$ identifies them with the [[symmetric polynomials]] in the [[first Chern class]] in $H^2(B U(1))$. This is the _[[splitting principle]]_.

**Literature.** ([Kochman 96, section 2.2 and 2.3](#Kochman96), [Switzer 75, section 15.3](#Switzer75) [Lurie 10, lecture 5, prop. 6](#Lurie10))

$\,$

Let $R$ be a [[commutative ring]] and let

$$
  \array{
    S^n &\longrightarrow& E
    \\
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\pi}}
    \\

be a [[fiber bundle]] of [[n-spheres]] over a [[simply connected topological space|simply connected]] [[simplicial complex]]. 

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

There exists a [[Thom class]]  $c \in H^{n+1}(E; R)$ (in the [[ordinary cohomology]] of the total space with [[coefficients]] in $R$) such that the [[cup product]] operation $c \cup (-)$ sits in a [[long exact sequence]] of [[cohomology groups]] of the form

$$
  \cdots 
   \to 
   H^k(B; R) 
     \stackrel{\pi^\ast}{\longrightarrow}
   H^k(E; R)
    \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}
   H^{k-n}(B;R)
   \stackrel{c \cup (-)}{\longrightarrow}
   H^{k+1}(B; R)
   \to
   \cdots
  \,.
$$

=--

(e.g. [Switzer 75, section 15.30](#Switzer75), [Kochman 96, corollary 2.2.6](#Kochman96))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

There is the corresponding [[Serre spectral sequence]] 

$$
  E_2^{s,t}
  =
  H^s(B; H^t(S^n;R))
  \;\Rightarrow\;
  H^{s+t}(E; R)
  \,.
$$

Since the [[ordinary cohomology]] of the [[n-sphere]] [[fiber]] is concentrated in just two degees

$$
  H^t(S^n; R)
  =
  \left\{
    \array{
      R & for \; t= 0 \; and \; t = n
      \\
      0 & otherwise
    }
  \right.
$$

most terms on the $E_2$ page of this spectral sequence, and hence on all the further pages, vanish. As a consequence, the only possible non-vanishing differentials $d_r$ are those on the $(n+1)$-page, of the form

$$
  \array{
     E_{n+1}^{s,n} & \simeq & H^s(B;R)
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{d_{n+1}}}\downarrow
     \\
     E_{n+1}^{s+n+1,0} & \simeq &  H^{s+n+1}(B;R)
  }
  \,.
$$

Now since the [[coefficients]] $R$ is a [[ring]], then by prop. \ref{AHSSForMultiplicativeCohomologyIsMultiplicative} the [[Serre spectral sequence]] is [[multiplicative spectral sequence|multiplicative]] under [[cup product]] and the [[differential]] is a [[derivation]] (of total degree 1) with respect to this product.

To make use of this, write

$$
  \iota = 1 \in H^0(B;R) \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} E_{n+1}^{0,n} 
$$

for the unit in the cup product ring $H^\bullet(X;R)$, regarded as an element in the $(n+1)$-page of the spectral sequence. Notice that as such $\iota$ is not in degree 0, but in bidegree $(0,n)$, in particular $\iota$ is _not_ in $E_{n+1}^{0,0}$ and in particular is not the unit in there, and hence $d_{n+1}(\iota)$ need not vanish. Write

$$
  c \coloneqq d_{n+1}(\iota) \in E_{n+1}^{n+1,0} \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} H^{n+1}(B; R)
$$

for this element. This is the Thom class in question.

Because, notice that every element in $E_{n+1}^{\bullet,n}$ is of the form $\iota \cdot b$ for $b\in E_{n+1}^{\bullet,0} \simeq H^\bullet(B;R)$, and since $d_{n+1}$ is a [[derivation]] and vanishes on $E_{n+1}^{\bullet,0}$, it follows that its action is fixed by 

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    d_{n+1}(\iota \cdot b)
    & =
    d_{n+1}(\iota) \cdot b + (-1)^{n} \iota \cdot \underset{= 0}{\underbrace{d_{n+1}(b)}}
    \\
    & = c \cdot b
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

This shows that 

$$
  \array{
     E_{n+1}^{s,n} & \simeq & H^s(B;R)
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{d_{n+1}}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{c \cup (-)}}
     \\
     E_{n+1}^{s+n+1, 0} & \simeq & H^{s+n+1}(B;R)
  }
  \,.
$$

Hence the non-vanishing entries of the $E_\infty$-page of the spectral sequence sit in [[exact sequences]] like so

$$
  \array{
     0
     \\
     \downarrow
     \\
     E_\infty^{s,n}
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{ker(d_{n+1})}}\downarrow
     \\
     E_{n+1}^{s,n} & \simeq & H^s(B;R)
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{d_{n+1}}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{c \cup (-)}}
     \\
     E_{n+1}^{s+n+1, 0} & \simeq & H^{s+n+1}(B;R)
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{coker}(d_{n+1})}\downarrow
     \\
     E_\infty^{s+n+1,0}
     \\
     \downarrow
     \\
     0
  }  
  \,.
$$

Finally observe (lemma \ref{lemma}) that due to the sparseness of the $E_\infty$-page, there are also [[short exact sequences]] of the form

$$
  0 \to E_\infty^{s,0} \longrightarrow H^s(E; R) \longrightarrow  E_\infty^{s-n,n} \to 0
  \,.
$$

Concatenating these with the above exact sequences yields the desired [[long exact sequence]].

+-- {: .num_lemma #lemma}
###### Lemma

For a cohomology [[spectral sequence]] converging to some $C^\bullet$ with the property that $E_\infty^{s,t} = 0$ unless $t = 0$ or $t = n$, then there are [[short exact sequences]] of the form

$$
  0 \to E_\infty^{s,0} \longrightarrow C^s \longrightarrow  E_\infty^{s-n,n} \to 0
  \,.
$$

=--

(e.g. [Switzer 75, p. 356](#Switzer75))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By definition of convergence the $E_{\infty}^{s,t}$ sit in [[short exact sequences]] of the form

$$
  0 \to F^{s+1}C^{s+t} \longrightarrow F^s C^{s+t} \longrightarrow E_\infty^{s,t} \to 0
  \,.
$$

So when $E_\infty^{s,t} = 0$ the left morphism here is an [[isomorphism]].

We may use this to either shift away the filtering degree

* if $t \geq n$ then $F^s C^{s+t} = F^{s}C^{s-1+t+1} \simeq F^0 C^{s-1+t+1} = F^0 C^{s+t} \simeq C^{s+t}$.

or to shift away the offset of the filtering to the total degree:

* if $0 \leq t-1 \leq n-1$ then $F^{s+1}C^{s+t} = F^{s+1}C^{s+1+t-1} = F^{s+t}C^{s+1+t-1} = F^{s+t}C^{s+t}$

* if $t \lt 0$ then $F^{s}C^{s+t} = 0$.

In particular $F^{s}C^{s} \simeq E_\infty^{s,0}$.

Hence the defining exact sequence

$$
  0 \to F^{s+1}C^{s+n} \longrightarrow F^{s}C^{s+n} \longrightarrow E_\infty^{s,n} \to 0
$$

becomes

$$
  0 \to E_\infty^{s+n,0} \longrightarrow C^{s+n} \longrightarrow E_\infty^{s,n}
 \to 0

#### Conner-Floyd Chern classes
 {#ConnerFloydChernClasses}

**Idea.** For $E$ a [[complex oriented cohomology theory]], then the generators of the $E$-[[cohomology groups]] of the [[classifying space]] $B U$ are called the _[[Conner-Floyd Chern classes]]_, in $E^\bullet(B U)$. 

Using basic properties of the classifying space $B U(1)$ via its incarnation as the infinite [[complex projective space]] $\mathbb{C}P^\infty$, one finds that the [[Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequences]]

$$
  H^p(\mathbb{C}P^n, \pi_q(E)) \Rightarrow H^\bullet(\mathbb{C}P^n)
$$

collapse right away, and that the [[inverse system]] which they form satisfies the [[Mittag-Leffler condition]]. Accordinly the [[Milnor exact sequence]] gives that the ordinary [[first Chern class]] $c_1$ generates,  over $\pi_\bullet(E)$, all Conner-Floyd classes over $B U(1)$:

$$
  E^\bullet(B U(1)) \simeq \pi_\bullet(E) [ [ c_1 ] ]

This is the key input for the discussion of [[formal group laws]] [below](#FormalGroupLaws).

Combining the [[Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence]] with the [[splitting principle]] as for ordinary Chern classes [above](#ChernClasses) yields, similarly, that in general Conner-Floyd classes are generated, over $\pi_\bullet(E)$, from the ordinary Chern classes.

Finally one checks that Conner-Floyd classes canonically serve as [[Thom classes]] for $E$-cohomology of the [[universal complex vector bundle]], therby showing that [[complex oriented cohomology theories]] are indeed canonically [[orientation in generalized cohomology|oriented]] on ([[spherical fibrations]] of) [[complex vector bundles]].

#### Formal group laws of first CF-Chern classes
 {#FormalGroupLaws}

**Idea.** The [[classifying space]] $B U(1)$ for [[complex line bundles]] is a [[homotopy type]] canonically equipped with commutative group structure ([[infinity-group]]-structure), corresponding to the [[tensor product]] of complex line bundles. By the above, the [[first Chern class]] of these complex line bundles generates the $E$-cohomology of $B U(1)$, it follows that the [[cohomology ring]] $E^\bullet(B U(1)) \simeq \pi_\bullet(E)[ [ c_1 ] ]$ behaves like the ring of $\pi_\bullet(E)$-valued functions on a 1-dimensional commutative [[formal group]] equipped with a canonical [[coordinate]] function $c_1$. This is called a _[[formal group law]]_ over the [[graded ring]] $\pi_\bullet(E)$. 

On abstract grounds it follows that there exists a commutative ring $L$ and a universal (1-dimensional commutative) formal group law $\ell$ over $L$. This is called the _[[Lazard ring]]_. [[Lazard's theorem]] identifies this ring concretely: it turns out to simply be the [[polynomial ring]] on generators in every even degree.

Further below this has profound implications on the structure theory for complex oriented cohomology. The [[Milnor-Quillen theorem on MU]] identifies the Lazard ring as the cohomology ring of the [[Thom spectrum]] [[MU]], and then the [[Landweber exact functor theorem]], implies that there are lots of complex oriented cohomology theories.

**Literature.** ([Kochman 96, section 4.4](#Kochman96), [Lurie 10, lectures 1 and 2](#Lurie10))


#### Complex cobordism
 {#ComplexCobordismCohomology}

**Idea.** There is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]] $\phi \colon B U(1)\stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} M U(1)$ between the [[classifying space]] for [[complex line bundles]] and the  [[Thom space]] of the [[universal vector bundle|universal complex line bundle]]. This gives an element $\pi_\ast(c_1) \in M U^2(B U(1))$ in the [[complex cobordism cohomology]] of $B U(1)$ which makes the universal complex [[Thom spectrum]] [[MU]] become a [[complex oriented cohomology theory]].

This turns out to be a [[universal complex orientation on MU]]: for every other [[ring spectrum]] $E$ there is an equivalence between complex orientations on $E$ and ring spectrum homomorphisms

$$
  \{M U \longrightarrow E\} \;\simeq\; \{complex\;orientations\;on\;E\}
  \,.
$$

Hence [[complex oriented cohomology theory]] is just [[higher algebra]] over [[MU]]. Equivalently: affine [[spectral geometry]] over $Spec(MU)$.

**Literature.** ([Schwede 12, example 1.18](#Schwede12), [Kochman 96, section 1.4, 1.5, 4.4](#Kochman96), [Lurie 10, lectures 5 and 6](#Lurie10))


#### Homology of $M U$
 {#HomologyOfMU}

**Idea.** Since, by the above, every [[complex oriented cohomology theory]] $E$ is indeed [[orientation in generalized cohomology|oriented]] over [[complex vector bundles]], there is a [[Thom isomorphism]] which reduces the computation of the $E$-[[homology of MU]], $E_\bullet(M U)$ to that of the [[classifying space]] $B U$. The homology of $B U$, in turn, may be determined by the duality with its cohomology ([[universal coefficient theorem]]) via [[Kronecker pairing]] and the induced duality of the corresponding [[Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequences]] (prop. \ref{AHSSPairing}) from the Conner-Floyed classes [above](#ConnerFloydChernClasses). Finally, via the [[Hurewicz homomorphism]]/[[Boardman homomorphism]] the homology of $M U$ gives a first approximation to the [[homotopy groups]] of [[MU]].

**Literature.** ([Kochman 96, section 2.4, 4.3](#Kochman96), [Lurie 10, lecture 7](#Lurie10))


#### Milnor-Quillen theorem on $M U$
 {#QuillenTheoremOnMU}

**Idea.** From the computation of the [[homology of MU]] [above](#HomologyOfMU) and applying the [[Boardman homomorphism]], one deduces that the [[stable homotopy groups]] $\pi_\bullet(MU)$ of [[MU]] are finitely generated. This implies that it is suffient to compute them over the [[p-adic integers]] for all primes $p$. Using the [[change of rings theorem]], this finally is obtained from inspection of the filtration in the $H\mathbb{F}_p$-[[Adams spectral sequence]] for $MU$. This is Milnor's theorem wich together with [[Lazard's theorem]] shows that there is an isomorphism of rings $L \simeq \pi_\bullet(M U)$ with the [[Lazard ring]]. Finally [[Quillen's theorem on MU]] says that this isomorphism is exhibited by the universal ring homomorphism $L \longrightarrow \pi_\bullet(M U)$ which classifies the universal complex orientation on $M U$.

**Literature.** ([Kochman 96, section 4.4](#Kochman96), [Lurie, lecture 10](#Lurie10))


#### Landweber exact functor theorem

**Idea.** By the above, every [[complex oriented cohomology theory]] induces a [[formal group law]] from its first [[Conner-Floyd Chern class]]. Moreover, [[Quillen's theorem on MU]] together with [[Lazard's theorem]] say that the [[cohomology ring]] $\pi_\bullet(M U)$ of [[complex cobordism cohomology]] [[MU]] is the classifying ring for formal group laws. 

The _[[Landweber exact functor theorem]]_ says that, conversely, forming the [[tensor product]] of [[complex cobordism cohomology theory]] ([[MU]]) with a [[Landweber exactness|Landweber exact]] [[ring]] via some [[formal group law]] yields a [[cohomology theory]], hence a [[complex oriented cohomology theory]]. 

**Literature.** ([Lurie 10, lectures 15,16](#Lurie10))

### Outlook: Geometry of $Spec(MU)$

The grand conclusion of [[Quillen's theorem on MU]] ([above](#QuillenTheoremOnMU)): [[complex oriented cohomology theory]] is essentially the [[spectral geometry]] over $Spec(M U)$, and the latter is a kind of derived version of the [[moduli stack of formal groups]] (1-dimensional commutative).
