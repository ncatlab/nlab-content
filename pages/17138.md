## Survey
 {#Introduction}

We are concerned with the theory of _[[spectra]]_ in the sense of [[algebraic topology]]: the proper generalization of [[abelian groups]] to [[homotopy theory]]. 

### 1) Stable homotopy theory
 {#StableHomotopyTheorySurvey}

A [[group]] in homotopy theory is equivalently a [[loop space]] under concatenation of loops ("[[∞-group]]"). A double loop space is a group with some commutativity structure ("[[Eckmann-Hilton argument]]"), a triple loop space has more commutativity structure, and so forth. A _spectrum_ is where this progression of [[looping and delooping]] _stabilizes_ (an "$\infty$-abelian group"). Therefore one speaks of _[[stable homotopy theory]]_:

$$
  Spaces
  \;\;
  \underoverset{(linearization)}{stabilization}{\mapsto}
  \;\;
  Spectra
  \,.
$$

Most of [[linear algebra]] and [[algebraic geometry]] passes along as [[abelian groups]] are generalized to [[spectra]] and turns into something remarkably rich, called _[[brave new algebra]]_, _[[higher algebra]]_ and _[[E-∞ geometry|spectral geometry]]_. In particular the analog of the theory of ([[commutative ring|commutative]]) [[rings]] and their [[modules]] exist, given by ([[commutative ring spectrum|commutative]]) [[ring spectra]] ([[E-∞ rings]], [[A-∞ rings]]) and [[module spectra]] ([[∞-modules]]). 

### 2) Adams spectral sequences
 {#ANSS}

Since spectra are considerably richer than abelian groups, stable homotopy is much concerned with "[[fracture theorem|fracturing]]" stable homotopy types into more tractable components:

To that end, notice that from the point of view of [[arithmetic geometry]], an [[abelian group]] $A$ is equivalently a [[quasicoherent sheaf]] over [[Spec(Z)]]. 

$$
  AbelianGroups \simeq QCoh(Spec(\mathbb{Z}))
  \,.
$$

This point of view generalizes to homotopy theory and turns out to be very fruitful there. The analog of the [[integers]] $\mathbb{Z}$ is the [[sphere spectrum]] $\mathbb{S}$, and this is naturally the [[initial object in an (infinity,1)-category|initial]] [[commutative ring spectrum]] ("[[E-∞ ring]]"), just as $\mathbb{Z}$ is the [[initial object|initial]] [[commutative ring]]. The [[formal dual]]  [[Spec(S)]] of $\mathbb{S}$ is hence the [[terminal object in an (infinity,1)-category|terminal]] [[space]] in [[E-∞ arithmetic geometry]] ("[[spectral geometry]]") and [[spectra]] are equivalently the [[quasicoherent ∞-stacks]] over $Spec(\mathbb{S})$

$$
  Spectra \simeq QCoh(Spec(\mathbb{S}))
  \,.
$$

Therefore the study of spectra "[[fracture theorem|fractures]]" into the various [[localizations]] and [[formal completions]] of $Spec(\mathbb{S})$. Since this is like the white light of $Spec(\mathbb{S})$ decomposing into various wavelengths, one speaks of _[[chromatic homotopy theory]]_. 

In particular, an  [[E-∞ ring]] $E$ is [[formal dual|dually]] a morphism of $E_\infty$-algebraic spaces $Spec(E) \longrightarrow Spec(\mathbb{S})$ and under good conditions the [[1-image]] of this map is the formal dual of the [[Bousfield localization of spectra|localization]] $L_E \mathbb{S}$ at $E$:

$$
  Spec(E) \stackrel{epi_1}{\longrightarrow} Spec(L_E \mathbb{S}) \stackrel{mono_1}{\longrightarrow} Spec(\mathbb{S})
 \,.
$$

This means that $Spec(E) \longrightarrow Spec(L_E \mathbb{S})$ is a [[cover]] and that hence $E$-local spectra are equivalently [[quasicoherent ∞-stacks]] on $Spec(E)$ equipped with [[descent data]]: [[formal dual|dually]] they are [[∞-modules]] over $E$ equipped with [[comodule]] structure over the [[Hopf algebroid]] ([[Sweedler coring]]) $E \otimes_{\mathbb{S}} E$.

The computation of [[homotopy groups]] of spectra that make use of their decomposition this way into $E$-[[∞-modules]] equipped with [[descent]] data is the _$E$-[[Adams spectral sequence]]_, a central tool of the theory.

### S) Complex oriented cohomology

For this reason special importance is carried by those [[E-∞ rings]] such that $Spec(E) \to Spec(\mathbb{S})$ is already a [[covering]], in a suitable sense, for these the $E$-[[∞-modules]] equipped with descent data give an equivalent, but in general more tractable, incarnation of the stable homotopy theory of spectra.

Curiously, this way a good bit of [[differential topology]] -- [[cobordism theory]] -- arises within stable homotopy theory: the archetypical $Spec(E)$ which covers $Spec(\mathbb{S})$ in a suitable sense is $E = $ [[MU]], the [[Thom spectrum]] representing [[complex cobordism cohomology]].

An [[commutative ring spectrum]] $E$ over $MU$, hence a $Spec(E)\to Spec(MU)$ is now a [[multiplicative cohomology theory|multiplicative]] "[[complex oriented cohomology theory]]".

### Basic reading

For **Prelude) Classical homotopy theory** a concise and self-contained re-write of the proof ([Quillen 67](#Quillen67)) of the [[classical model structure on topological spaces]] is in

* {#Hirschhorn15} [[Philip Hirschhorn]], _The Quillen model category of topological spaces_ ([arXiv:1508.01942](http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.01942)).

For general [[model category]] theory a decent concise account is in

* {#DwyerSpalinski95} [[William Dwyer]], J. Spalinski, _[[Homotopy theories and model categories]]_ ([pdf](http://folk.uio.no/paularne/SUPh05/DS.pdf)) in [[Ioan Mackenzie James]] (ed.), _[[Handbook of Algebraic Topology]]_ 1995

For section **1) Stable homotopy theory** we follow the modern picture of the stable homotopy category for which an enjoyable survey may be found in

* {#Malkiewich14} [[Cary Malkiewich]], _The stable homotopy category_, 2014 ([pdf](http://math.uiuc.edu/~cmalkiew/stable.pdf)).

The classical account in ([Adams 74, part III sections 2, 4-7](#Adams74)) is still a good read, but ignore the "[[Adams category]]"-construction of the [[stable homotopy category]] in sections III.2 and III.3. What we actually do follows

For the discussion of [[ring spectra]] we pass to [[symmetric spectra]] and [[orthogonal spectra]]. A compendium on the former is in

* {#Schwede12} [[Stefan Schwede]], _[[Symmetric spectra]]_, 2012 ([pdf](http://www.math.uni-bonn.de/~schwede/SymSpec-v3.pdf))


For **Interlude: Spectral sequences** a discussion streamlined for our purposes is in ([Rognes 12, section 2](#Rognes12)).

For the special case of the [[classical Adams spectral sequence]] we follow ([Kochman 96, chapter V](#Kochman96)).

For **S.2) Cobordism theory** an efficient collection of the highlights is in

* {#Malkiewich11} [[Cary Malkiewich]], _Unoriented cobordism and $M O$_, 2011 ([pdf](http://math.uiuc.edu/~cmalkiew/cobordism.pdf))

except that it omits proof of the [[Leray-Hirsch theorem]]/[[Serre spectral sequence]] and that of the [[Thom isomorphism]], but see the references there and see ([Kochman 96](#Kochman96), [Aguilar-Gitler-Prieto 02, section 11.7](#AguilarGitlerPrieto02)) for details.
 
For **S.3) Complex oriented cohomology** besides ([Kochman 96, chapter 4](#Kochman96)) have a look at [Adams 74, part II](#Adams74) and

* {#Lurie10} [[Jacob Lurie]], lectures 1-10 of _[[Chromatic Homotopy Theory]]_, 2010

(These overlap, pick the one that seems more inviting on first reading.)
