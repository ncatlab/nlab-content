## Survey
 {#Introduction}

We are concerned with the theory of _[[spectra]]_ in the sense of [[algebraic topology]]: the proper generalization of [[abelian groups]] to [[homotopy theory]]. 

### 1) Stable homotopy theory
 {#StableHomotopyTheory}

A [[group]] in homotopy theory is equivalently a [[loop space]] under concatenation of loops ("[[∞-group]]"). A double loop space is a group with some commutativity structure ("[[Eckmann-Hilton argument]]"), a triple loop space has more commutativity structure, and so forth. A _spectrum_ is where this progression of [[looping and delooping]] _stabilizes_ (an "$\infty$-abelian group"). Therefore one speaks of _[[stable homotopy theory]]_:

$$
  Spaces
  \;\;
  \underoverset{(linearization)}{stabilization}{\mapsto}
  \;\;
  Spectra
  \,.
$$

Most of [[linear algebra]] and [[algebraic geometry]] passes along as [[abelian groups]] are generalized to [[spectra]] and turns into something remarkably rich, called _[[brave new algebra]]_, _[[higher algebra]]_ and _[[E-∞ geometry|spectral geometry]]_. In particular the analog of the theory of ([[commutative ring|commutative]]) [[rings]] and their [[modules]] exist, given by ([[commutative ring spectrum|commutative]]) [[ring spectra]] ([[E-∞ rings]], [[A-∞ rings]]) and [[module spectra]] ([[∞-modules]]). 

### 2) Adams spectral sequences
 {#ANSS}

Since spectra are considerably richer than abelian groups, stable homotopy is much concerned with "[[fracture theorem|fracturing]]" stable homotopy types into more tractable components:

To that end, notice that from the point of view of [[arithmetic geometry]], an [[abelian group]] $A$ is equivalently a [[quasicoherent sheaf]] over [[Spec(Z)]]. 

$$
  AbelianGroups \simeq QCoh(Spec(\mathbb{Z}))
  \,.
$$

This point of view generalizes to homotopy theory and turns out to be very fruitful there. The analog of the [[integers]] $\mathbb{Z}$ is the [[sphere spectrum]] $\mathbb{S}$, and this is naturally the [[initial object in an (infinity,1)-category|initial]] [[commutative ring spectrum]] ("[[E-∞ ring]]"), just as $\mathbb{Z}$ is the [[initial object|initial]] [[commutative ring]]. The [[formal dual]]  [[Spec(S)]] of $\mathbb{S}$ is hence the [[terminal object in an (infinity,1)-category|terminal]] [[space]] in [[E-∞ arithmetic geometry]] ("[[spectral geometry]]") and [[spectra]] are equivalently the [[quasicoherent ∞-stacks]] over $Spec(\mathbb{S})$

$$
  Spectra \simeq QCoh(Spec(\mathbb{S}))
  \,.
$$

Therefore the study of spectra "[[fracture theorem|fractures]]" into the various [[localizations]] and [[formal completions]] of $Spec(S)$. Since this is like the white light of $Spec(S)$ decomposing into various wavelengths, one speaks of _[[chromatic homotopy theory]]_. 

In particular, an  [[E-∞ ring]] $E$ is [[formal dual|dually]] a morphism of $E_\infty$-algebraic spaces $Spec(E) \longrightarrow Spec(\mathbb{S})$ and under good conditions the [[1-image]] of this map is the formal dual of the [[Bousfield localization of spectra|localization]] $L_E \mathbb{S}$ at $E$:

$$
  Spec(E) \stackrel{epi_1}{\longrightarrow} Spec(L_E \mathbb{S}) \stackrel{mono_1}{\longrightarrow} Spec(\mathbb{S})
 \,.
$$

This means that $Spec(E) \longrightarrow Spec(L_E \mathbb{S})$ is a [[cover]] and that hence $E$-local spectra are equivalently [[quasicoherent ∞-stacks]] on $Spec(E)$ equipped with [[descent data]]: [[formal dual|dually]] they are [[∞-modules]] over $E$ equipped with [[comodule]] structure over the [[Hopf algebroid]] ([[Sweedler coring]]) $E \otimes_{\mathbb{S}} E$.

The computation of [[homotopy groups]] of spectra that make use of their decomposition this way into $E$-[[∞-modules]] equipped with [[descent]] data is the _$E$-[[Adams spectral sequence]]_, a central tool of the theory.

### S) Complex oriented cohomology

For this reason special importance is carried by those [[E-∞ rings]] such that $Spec(E) \to Spec(\mathbb{S})$ is already a [[covering]], for these the $E$-[[∞-modules]] equipped with descent data give an equivalent, but in general more tractable, incarnation of the stable homotopy theory of spectra.

Curiously, this way a good bit of [[differential topology]] -- [[cobordism theory]] -- arises within stable homotopy theory: the archetypical $Spec(E)$ which covers $Spec(\mathbb{S})$ is $E = $ [[MU]], the [[Thom spectrum]] representing [[complex cobordism cohomology]].

An [[commutative ring spectrum]] $E$ over $MU$, hence a $Spec(E)\to Spec(MU)$ is now a [[multiplicative cohomology theory|multiplicative]] "[[complex oriented cohomology theory]]".

## **Prelude) Classical homotopy theory**
 {#ClassicalHomotopyTheory}


We are interested in the [[stable homotopy category]] of [[spectra]], to which we turn [below](#Spectra). But since its existence is an adjunct of the plain [[homotopy category]] [[Ho(Top)]] of [[homotopy types]] of [[topological spaces]]/[[simplicial sets]], we here review that first.

**Literature.** ([Goerss-Jardine 96, chapter I](#GoerssJardine96)).


### Simplicial sets
 {#SimplicialSets}

While historically the field of [[algebraic topology]] originated in [[topology]], it not actually interested in [[topological spaces]] regarded up to topological [[isomorphism]] ([[homeomorphism]]), but only in topological spaces regarded up to [[weak homotopy equivalence]] -- in their "[[homotopy types]]". This is so notably because [[ordinary cohomology]] [[cohomology group|groups]] are invariants of the (weak) [[homotopy type]] of topological spaces but do not detect their [[homeomorphism]] class. The [[category]] of topological spaces obtained by regarding [[weak homotopy equivalences]] as [[isomorphisms]] is the "classical [[homotopy category]]" [[Ho(Top)]], which we discuss [below](#TheClassicalHomotopyCategory).

But the nature of [[objects]] in any [[category]] is not determined by how we present these objects, but by what the [[morphisms]] between them are. In this respect, the objects of [[Ho(Top)]] turn out to have lost the geometric nature of topology to retain only a more set-theoretic combinatorial nature. This is more explicitly captured by the concept of _[[simplicial sets]]_.

Simplicial sets are secretly well familiar already in basic [[algebraic topology]]: they reflect just the abstract structure carried by the [[singular simplicial complexes]] that appear in the definition of [[singular homology]]/[[singular cohomology]]. 


+-- {: .num_defn #TopologicalSimplex}
###### Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the **[topological n-simplex](simplex#TopologicalSimplex)** is,  up to [[nLab:homeomorphism]], the [[nLab:topological space]] whose underlying set is the subset

$$
  \Delta^n \coloneqq 
  \{
    \vec x \in \mathbb{R}^{n+1}
    |
    \sum_{i = 0 }^n x_i = 1 \; and \;
    \forall i . x_i \geq 0 
  \}
  \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}
$$

of the [[nLab:Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, and whose topology is the  [[nLab:subspace topology]] induces from the canonical topology in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$.

=--

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

For $n = 0$ this is the [[nLab:point]], $\Delta^0 = *$.

For $n = 1$ this is the standard [[nLab:interval object]] $\Delta^1 = [0,1]$.

For $n = 2$ this is the filled triangle.

For $n = 3$ this is the filled tetrahedron.

+-- {: .num_defn #FaceInclusionInBarycentricCoords}
###### Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $\n \geq 1$ and $0 \leq k \leq n$, the 
**$k$th $(n-1)$-face (inclusion)**  of the topological $n$-simplex, def. \ref{TopologicalSimplex}, is the subspace inclusion

$$
  \delta_k : \Delta^{n-1} \hookrightarrow \Delta^n
$$

induced under the coordinate presentation of def. \ref{TopologicalSimplex},
by the inclusion 

$$
  \mathbb{R}^n \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n+1}
$$

which "omits" the $k$th canonical coordinate:

$$
  (x_0, \cdots , x_{n-1}) \mapsto (x_0, \cdots, x_{k-1} , 0 , x_{k}, \cdots, x_n)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

The inclusion 

$$
  \delta_0 : \Delta^0 \to \Delta^1
$$ 

is the inclusion

$$
  \{1\} \hookrightarrow [0,1]
$$ 

of the "right" end of the standard interval. The other inclusion 

$$
  \delta_1 : \Delta^0 \to \Delta^1
$$ 

is that of the "left" end $\{0\} \hookrightarrow [0,1]$.

+-- {: .num_defn #DegeneracyProjectionsInBarycentricCoords}
###### Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $0 \leq k \lt n$ the **$k$th degenerate $(n)$-simplex (projection)** is the surjective map

$$
  \sigma_k : \Delta^{n} \to \Delta^{n-1}
$$

induced under the barycentric coordinates of def. \ref{TopologicalSimplex} under the surjection

$$
  \mathbb{R}^{n+1} \to \mathbb{R}^n
$$

which sends

$$
  (x_0, \cdots, x_n) \mapsto (x_0, \cdots, x_{k} + x_{k+1}, \cdots, x_n)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #SingularSimplex}
###### Definition

For $X \in $ [[Top]]  and $n \in \mathbb{N}$, a **singular $n$-simplex** in $X$ is a [[continuous map]]

$$
  \sigma : \Delta^n \to X
$$

from the topological $n$-simplex, def. \ref{TopologicalSimplex}, to $X$.

Write 

$$
  (Sing X)_n \coloneqq Hom_{Top}(\Delta^n , X)
$$ 

for the set of singular $n$-simplices of $X$.

(graphics taken from [Friedman 08](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/simplicial+set#Friedman08))

The sets $(Sing X)_\bullet$ here are closely related by an interlocking system of maps that make them form what is called a _[[simplicial set]]_, and as such the collection of these sets of singular simplices is called the _[[singular simplicial complex]]_ of $X$. We discuss the definition of simplicial sets now and then come back to this below in def. \ref{SingularSimplicialComplex}.

Since the topological $n$-simplices $\Delta^n$ from def. \ref{TopologicalSimplex} sit inside each other by the face inclusions of def. \ref{FaceInclusionInBarycentricCoords}

$$
  \delta_k : \Delta^{n-1} \to \Delta^{n}
$$

and project onto each other by the degeneracy maps, def. \ref{DegeneracyProjectionsInBarycentricCoords}

$$
  \sigma_k : \Delta^{n+1} \to \Delta^n
$$

we dually have functions

$$
  d_k \coloneqq Hom_{Top}(\delta_k, X) : (Sing X)_n \to (Sing X)_{n-1}
$$

that send each singular $n$-simplex to its $k$-face and functions

$$
  s_k \coloneqq Hom_{Top}(\sigma_k,X) : (Sing X)_{n} \to (Sing X)_{n+1}
$$

that regard an $n$-simplex as beign a degenerate ("thin") $(n+1)$-simplex.
All these sets of simplices and face and degeneracy maps between them form the following structure. 

+-- {: .num_defn #SimplicialSet}
###### Definition

A **[[nLab:simplicial set]]** $S \in sSet$ is 

* for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ a [[nLab:set]] $S_n \in Set$ -- the **set of $n$-[[simplices]]**;

* for each [[injective map]] $\delta_i : \overline{n-1} \to \overline{n}$ of [[nLab:totally ordered sets]] $\bar n \coloneqq \{ 0 \lt 1 \lt \cdots \lt n \}$

  a [[function]] $d_i : S_{n} \to S_{n-1}$ -- the $i$th **face map** on $n$-simplices;

* for each [[surjective map]] $\sigma_i : \overline{n+1} \to \bar n$ of [[totally ordered sets]]

  a [[function]] $\sigma_i : S_{n} \to S_{n+1}$ -- the $i$th **degeneracy map** on $n$-simplices;

such that these functions satisfy the _[[nLab:simplicial identities]]_.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #SimplicialIdentities}
###### Definition

The **simplicial identities** satisfied by face and degeneracy maps as above are (whenever these maps are composable as indicated):

1. $ d_i \circ d_j  = d_{j-1} \circ d_i$ if $i \lt j$,

1. $s_i \circ s_j  = s_j \circ s_{i-1}$ if $i \gt j$.

1. $d_i \circ s_j =  \left\{ \array{ s_{j-1} \circ d_i &  if \;  i \lt j \\ id & if  \;  i = j \; or \; i = j+1 \\ s_j \circ d_{i-1} &  if i \gt j+1 } \right. $

=--

It is straightforward to check by explicit inspection that the evident injection and restriction maps between the sets of [[singular simplices]] make $(Sing X)_\bullet$ into a simplicial set. However for working with this, it is good to streamline a little:

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

The **[[simplex category]]** $\Delta$ is the [[full subcategory]] of [[Cat]] on the free categories of the form

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    [0] & \coloneqq \{0\}
    \\
    [1] & \coloneqq \{0 \to 1\}
    \\
   [2] & \coloneqq \{0 \to 1 \to 2\}
   \\
   \vdots
   \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

This is called the "simplex category" because we are to think of the object $[n]$ as being the "[[spine]]" of the $n$-[[nLab:simplex]]. For instance for $n = 2$ we think of $0 \to 1 \to 2$ as the "spine" of the triangle. This becomes clear if we don't just draw the morphisms that _generate_ the category $[n]$, but draw also all their composites. For instance for $n = 2$ we have_

$$
  [2]  
  = 
  \left\{
  \array{
     && 1
     \\
     & \nearrow && \searrow
     \\
    0 &&\to&& 2
  }
  \right\}
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

A [[functor]] 

$$
  S : \Delta^{op} \to Set
$$

from the [[nLab:opposite category]] of the [[nLab:simplex category]] to the category [[nLab:Set]] of sets is canonically identified with a [[nLab:simplicial set]], def. \ref{SimplicialSet}.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

One checks by inspection that the simplicial identities 
characterize precisely the behaviour of the morphisms in
$\Delta^{op}([n],[n+1])$ and $\Delta^{op}([n],[n-1])$.

=--

This makes the following evident:

+-- {: .num_example #StandardCosimplicialTopologicalSpace}
###### Example

The [[topological simplices]] from def. \ref{TopologicalSimplex} arrange into a _[[cosimplicial object]] in [[Top]]_, namely a [[functor]]

$$
  \Delta^\bullet : \Delta \to Top
  \,.
$$

=--

With this now the structure of a simplicial set on $(Sing X)_\bullet$, def. \ref{SingularSimplex}, is manifest: it is just the _[[nerve]]_ of $X$ with respect to $\Delta^\bullet$, namely:

+-- {: .num_defn #SingularSimplicialComplex}
###### Definition

For $X$ a [[topological space]] its **[[singular simplicial complex|simplicial set of singular simplicies]]**  (often called the **[[singular simplicial complex]]**)

$$
  (Sing X)_\bullet : \Delta^{op} \to Set
$$

is given by composition of the functor from example \ref{StandardCosimplicialTopologicalSpace} with the [[nLab:hom functor]] of [[nLab:Top]]:

$$
  (Sing X) : [n] \mapsto Hom_{Top}( \Delta^n , X )
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark 

It turns out -- this is the content of the _[[nLab:homotopy hypothesis]]-theorem_ ([Quillen 67](model+structure+on+simplicial+sets#Quillen67)) -- that [[homotopy type]] of the topological space $X$ is entirely captured by its singular simplicial complex $Sing X$. Moreover, the [[geometric realization]] of $Sing X$ is a model for the same [[homotopy type]] as that of $X$, but with the special property that it is canonically a [[cell complex]] -- a [[CW-complex]]. Better yet, $Sing X$ is itself already good cell complex, namely a [[Kan complex]].

=--


+-- {: .num_defn #Horn}
###### Definition

For each $i$, $0 \leq i \leq n$, the **$(n,i)$-horn** 
is the subsimplicial set 

$$
  \Lambda^i[n]
  \hookrightarrow
  \Delta[n] 
$$

of the simplicial $n$-[[simplex]], which is the [[union]] of all faces _except_ the  $i^{th}$ one.

This is called an **outer horn** if $k = 0$ or $k = n$.  Otherwise it is an **inner horn**.

(graphics taken from [Friedman 08](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/simplicial+set#Friedman08))


+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

Since [[sSet]]  is a [[presheaf category]], [[unions]] of [[subobjects]] make sense and they are calculated objectwise, thus in this case dimensionwise.  This way it becomes clear what the structure of a horn as a functor $\Lambda^k[n]: \Delta^{op} \to Set$ must therefore be: it takes $[m]$ to the collection of ordinal maps $f: [m] \to [n]$ which do not have the element $k$ in the image.

=--


+-- {: .num_defn #KanComplexes}
###### Definition

A _[[Kan complex]]_ is a [[simplicial set]] $S$ that satisfies the _Kan condition_, 

* which says that all [[horns]] of the simplicial set have _fillers_/extend to [[simplices]];

* which means equivalently that the unique homomorphism $S \to pt$ from $S$ to the [[point]] (the [[terminal object|terminal]] [[simplicial set]]) is a [[Kan fibration]];

* which means equivalently that for all [[diagrams]] of the form

  $$
  \array{
    \Lambda^i[n] &\to& S
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \Delta[n] &\to& pt
  }
  \;\;\;
  \leftrightarrow
  \;\;\;
  \array{
    \Lambda^i[n] &\to& S
    \\
    \downarrow && 
    \\
    \Delta[n] 
  }
  $$

  there exists a diagonal morphism

  $$
  \array{
    \Lambda^i[n] &\to& S
    \\
    \downarrow &\nearrow& \downarrow
    \\
    \Delta[n] &\to& pt
  }
  \;\;\;
  \leftrightarrow
  \;\;\;
  \array{
    \Lambda^i[n] &\to& S
    \\
    \downarrow &\nearrow& 
    \\
    \Delta[n] 
  }
  $$

  completing this to a [[commuting diagram]];

* which in turn means equivalently that the map from $n$-simplices to $(n,i)$-horns is an [[epimorphism]]
$$
  [\Delta[n], S]\, \twoheadrightarrow \,[\Lambda^i[n],S]
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

For $X$ a [[topological space]], its [[singular simplicial complex]]
$Sing(X)$, def. \ref{SingularSimplicialComplex}, is a Kan complex, def. \ref{KanComplexes}.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The inclusions ${{\Lambda^n}_{Top}}_k \hookrightarrow \Delta^n_{Top}$ of topological horns into topological simplices are  [[retracts]], in that there are [[continuous maps]] $\Delta^n_{Top} \to {{\Lambda^n}_{Top}}_k$ given by "squashing" a topological $n$-simplex onto parts of its boundary, such that

$$
  ({{\Lambda^n}_{Top}}_k \to \Delta^n_{Top} \to
  {{\Lambda^n}_{Top}}_k)
  =
  Id
  \,.
$$

Therefore the map
$[\Delta^n, \Pi(X)] \to [\Lambda^n_k,\Pi(X)]$ is an epimorphism, since it is equal to  to $Top(\Delta^n, X) \to Top(\Lambda^n_k, X)$ which has a right inverse $Top(\Lambda^n_k, X) \to Top(\Delta^n, X)$.

With this we finally arrive at a presentation of the classical homotopy category. For our purposes the following may be taken to be a definition, otherwise it is part of the theorem of ([Quillen 67](model+structure+on+simplicial+sets#Quillen67)), known sometimes as the _[homotopy hypothesis for Kan complexes](homotopy hypothesis#ForKanComplexes)_.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

The classical [[homotopy category]] [[Ho(Top)]] $\simeq$ [[Ho(sSet)]] $\simeq$ [[Ho(∞Grpd)]]
is [[equivalence of categories|equivalently]] the category whose

* [[objects]] are [[Kan complexes]];

* [[morphisms]], are left-[[homotopy classes]], def. \ref{LeftHomotopyIsEquivalence}, of morphisms of simplicial sets.

=--

(...)


## **Part 1) Stable homotopy theory**

We set up [[stable homotopy theory]].
 
**Literature.** For a decent quick idea see ([Malkiewich 14](#Malkiewich14)).
The original is still good: ([Adams 74, part III sections 2-7](#Adams74)),
except where it considers the [[stable homotopy category]] in its incarnation
as the [[Adams category]], better to consider the [[homotopy category]] of the
[[Bousfield-Friedlander model structure]]. We go through this [below](#Spectra).


### Motivating theorems

The 0th approximation to making [[Ho(Top)]] become more like an [[abelian category]] is passage to [[pointed topological spaces]], and [[pointed objects|pointed]] [[simplicial sets]]:

every category of [[pointed objects]] has 

1. a [[zero object]] (the point) and [[zero morphisms]] (those factoring through the point);

1. a canonical non-Cartesian [[tensor product]], the _[[smash product]]_ $\wedge$.

Given the base point, there is the [[loop space]]-construction $\Omega(-) \simeq [S^1,-]$ on that base point. It has a [[left adjoint]], the [[reduced suspension]] operation $\Sigma(-) \simeq S^1 \wedge (-)$.

Motivation for stabilization under $(\Sigma \dashv \Omega)$:

* [[Eckmann-Hilton argument]] (...[[May recognition theorem]])

* [[Freudenthal suspension theorem]]

* [[triangulated category]]-structure on [[Spanier-Whitehead category]]

Further motivation which is the subject of the [seminar](#ComplexOrientedCohomology):

* [[generalized cohomology]]

  * [[suspension isomorphism]]

  * [[Brown representability theorem]]

* [[cobordism theory]]

  [[Thom's theorem]]




### The stable homotopy category
 {#Spectra}


The [[stable homotopy category]] is to be the proper [[stabilization]] of the classical [[homotopy category]] [[Ho(Top)]] $\simeq$ [[Ho(sSet)]] under the operation of forming [[loop space objects]] $\Omega$ and [[reduced suspensions]] $\Sigma$: via forming [[suspension spectra]] $\Sigma^\infty$ every [[pointed object]] in the classical [[homotopy category]] maps to the stable homotopy category, and under this map the [[loop space]]- and [[reduced suspension]]-[[functors]] become inverse [[equivalence of categories|equivalences]] on the stable homotopy category.

$$
  \array{
     Ho(Top)^{\ast/} 
      &
      \underoverset{\underset{\Omega}{\longrightarrow}}{\overset{\Sigma}{\longleftarrow}}{} 
      &
     Ho(Top)^{\ast/}
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\Sigma^\infty}}\downarrow \dashv \uparrow^{\mathrlap{\Omega^\infty}}
     &&
     {}^{\mathllap{\Sigma^\infty}}\downarrow \dashv \uparrow^{\mathrlap{\Omega^\infty}}
     \\
     Ho(Spectra) 
     &
     \underoverset{\underset{\Omega}{\longrightarrow}}{\overset{\Sigma}{\longleftarrow}}{\simeq}
     &
     Ho(Spectra)
  }
  \,.
$$


In contrast to the classical [[homotopy category]], the stable homotopy category is a [[triangulated category]] (a shadow of the fact that the [[(∞,1)-category of spectra]] is a [[stable (∞,1)-category]]). As such it may be thought of as a refinement of the [[derived category]] [[category of chain complexes|of chain complexes]] (of [[abelian groups]]): every [[chain complex]] gives rise to a [[spectrum]] and every [[chain map]] to a map between these spectra (the [[stable Dold-Kan correspondence]]), but there are many more spectra and maps between them than arise from chain complexes and chain maps.

Let $E \in Spec$ be a [[spectrum]]. 

Say that another spectrum $X \in Spec$ is an **$E$-acyclic spectrum** if the [[smash product of spectra|smash product]] is [[zero object|zero]], $E \wedge X \simeq 0$.

Say that $X$ is an **$E$-local spectrum** if every [[morphism]]
$Y \longrightarrow X$ out of an $E$-acyclic spectrum $Y$ is homotopic to the [[zero morphism]]. 

Say that a morphism $f \colon X \to Y$ is an **$E$-equivalence** if it becomes an [[equivalence]] after [[smash product]] with $E$.

where $G_E(X)$ is $E$-acyclic, and $L_E(X)$ is $E$-local, def. \ref{AcyclicAndLocal}.

Here $X \to L_E (X)$ is characterized by two properties

1. $L_E(X)$ is $E$-local;

1. $X \to L_E(X)$ is an $E$-equivalence

according to def. \ref{AcyclicAndLocal}.

* $\mathbb{Z}_n$ for $n \geq 2$.

Then the map in remark \ref{CanonicalMapFromELocalizationToTotalization} is an equivalence

**(Sullivan arithmetic square)**

For every [[spectrum]] $X$ the canonical square

$$

Original statements of this include ([Bousfield 79](#Bousfield79), [Sullivan 05, prop. 3.20](#Sullivan05)). Review includes ([van Koughnett 13, prop. 4.5](#VanKoughnett13)). 


So the [[nLab:arithmetic fracture square]] from [[nLab:Weil uniformization theorem|Weil uniformization]] over [[nLab:Spec(S)]] synthesizes spectra from their formal completion and torsion approximation:


$$

    &&  {{localization} \atop {away\;from\;p}} && \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow} && {{p-adic} \atop {residual}}

The product of all [[p-completions]] is equivalently the [[Bousfield localization of spectra]] at the [[wedge sum]] $\vee_p S \mathbb{F}_p$ of all [[Moore spectra]]


$$
  \prod_p L_p X

Moreover there is a  [[Bousfield equivalence]] 

$$
  S (\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}) \simeq_{Bousf} \vee_p S \mathbb{F}_p
  \,,
$$ 

and therefore also an equivalence

$$
  \prod_p L_p X

   L_{S (\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z})} X

The first statement originates around ([Bousfield 79, prop. 2.6](Bousfield+localization+of+spectra#Bousfield79)), review includes ([van Koughnett 13, prop. 4.4](Bousfield+localization+of+spectra#VanKoughnett13)); the second is highlighted in ([Strickland 12, MO comment](http://mathoverflow.net/a/91057/381)).


By prop. \ref{ReformulationOfProdOverPComletionByLocalizationAtCoproduct}
the arithmetic fracture square of prop. \ref{SullivanArithmeticFracture} is equivalently of the form

$$
  \array{

     & \nwarrow && \swarrow

    && L_{S \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}} X

In this form the statement holds much more generally:

+-- {: .num_prop #GeneralFractureSquare}
###### Proposition

Let $E, F, X$ be [[spectra]] such that the $F$-[[Bousfield localization of spectra|localization]] of $X$ is $E$-acyclic, i.e.  $E_\bullet(L_F X) \simeq 0$, then the canonical square [[diagram]]

is a [[homotopy pullback]] (and hence by stability also a [[homotopy pushout]]).

## **Interlude) Spectral sequences**
 {#SpectralSequences}

In the end, what one wants to compute in stable homotopy 
theory are [[stable homotopy groups]] of [[spectra]] that are built
from other spaces and spectra in some way. Notably one wants to 
know the homotopy groups of [[mapping spectra]] $[X,E]$ ([[generalized cohomology|generalized]] [[cohomology groups]] $E^\bullet(X) \coloneqq \pi_\bullet([X,E])$)
and of [[smash products of spectra]] $E \wedge X$ ([[generalized homology|generalized]] [[homology groups]] $E_\bullet(X)\coloneqq \pi_\bullet(E \wedge X)$).

In general the only practicable way to carry out such computations is by doing them along a decomposition of the given spectrum into a "sequence of stages" of sorts. The concept of _[[spectral sequence]]_ is what formalizes this idea.

(Here the re-occurence of the root "spectr-" it is a historical coincidence, but a lucky one.)


### For filtered complexes
 {#SpectralSequencesForFilteredChainComplexes}

We begin with recalling basics of [[ordinary cohomology|ordinary]] _[[relative homology]]_ and then seamlessly derive the notion of _[[spectral sequences]]_ from that as the natural way of computing the ordinary cohomology of a [[CW-complex]] stagewise from the relative cohomology of its [[simplicial skeleton|skeleta]]. This is meant as motivation and warmup. What we are mostly going to use further below are spectral sequences induced by [[filtered spectra]], this we turn to [next](#SpectralSequencesForFilteredSpectra).

$\,$


Let $X$ be a [[topological space]] and $A \hookrightarrow X$ a [[topological subspace]]. Write $C_\bullet(X)$ for the [[chain complex]] of [[singular homology]] on $X$ and $C_\bullet(A) \hookrightarrow C_\bullet(X)$ for the [[chain map]] induced by the subspace inclusion.

+-- {: .num_defn #RelativeSingularHomology}
###### Definition

The (degreewise) [[nLab:cokernel]] of this inclusion, hence the [[quotient]] $C_\bullet(X)/C_\bullet(A)$ of $C_\bullet(X)$ by the [[image]] of $C_\bullet(A)$ under the inclusion, is the **chain complex of $A$-relative singular chains**. 

* A [[nLab:boundary]] in this quotient is called an **$A$-relative singular boundary**, 

* a [[nLab:cycle]] is called an **$A$-relative singular cycle**.

* The [[nLab:chain homology]] of the quotient is the **$A$-relative singular homology of $X$**

  $$
    H_n(X , A)\coloneqq H_n(C_\bullet(X)/C_\bullet(A))
    \,.
  $$

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

This means that a singular $(n+1)$-chain $c \in C_{n+1}(X)$ is an $A$-relative cycle precisely if its [[nLab:boundary]] $\partial c \in C_{n}(X)$ is, while not necessarily 0, contained in the $n$-chains of $A$: $\partial c \in C_n(A) \hookrightarrow C_n(X)$. So the boundary vanishes possibly only "up to contributions coming from $A$".

=--

We record two evident but important classes of [[nLab:long exact sequences]] that relative homology groups sit in:

+-- {: .num_prop #RelativeHomologyLongExactSequence}
###### Proposition

Let $A \stackrel{i}{\hookrightarrow} X$ be a [[nLab:topological subspace]] inclusion. The corresponding 
relative singular homology, def. \ref{RelativeSingularHomology}, sits in a [[nLab:long exact sequence]] of the form

$$
  \cdots
  \to 
  H_n(A)
   \stackrel{H_n(i)}{\to}
  H_n(X)
  \to 
  H_n(X, A)

  H_{n-1}(X)
  \to 
  H_{n-1}(X, A)
  \to 
  \cdots
  \,.
$$

The [[nLab:connecting homomorphism]] $\delta_{n} \colon H_{n+1}(X, A) \to H_n(A)$ sends an element $[c] \in H_{n+1}(X, A)$ represented by an $A$-relative cycle $c \in C_{n+1}(X)$, to the class represented by the [[nLab:boundary]] $\partial^X c \in C_n(A) \hookrightarrow C_n(X)$.

The corresponding [[nLab:homology long exact sequence]], prop. \ref{HomologyLongExactSequence}, is the long exact sequence in question.

We look at some concrete fundamental examples in a moment. But first it is useful to make explicit the following general sub-notion of relative homology.

Let $X$ still be a given [[nLab:topological space]].

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

The **[[nLab:augmentation]] map** for the [[nLab:singular homology]] of $X$ is the [[nLab:homomorphism]] of [[nLab:abelian groups]]

$$

which adds up all the coefficients of all 0-chains:

$$
  \epsilon \colon \colon \sum_{i} n_i \sigma_i \mapsto \sum_i n_i
  \,.
$$

Since the [[nLab:boundary]] of a 1-chain is in the [[nLab:kernel]] of this map, by example \ref{BasicExamplesOfChainBoundaries}, it constitutes a [[nLab:chain map]]

$$
  \epsilon \colon C_\bullet(X) \to \mathbb{Z}

where now $\mathbb{Z}$ is regarded as a chain complex concentrated in degree 0.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The [[nLab:homology long exact sequence]], prop. \ref{HomologyLongExactSequence}, of the defining short exact sequence $\tilde C_\bullet(C) \to C_\bullet(X) \stackrel{\epsilon}{\to} \mathbb{Z}$ is, since $\mathbb{Z}$ here is concentrated in degree 0, of the form

$$
  \cdots \to \tilde H_n(X) \to H_n(X) \to 0 \to \cdots \to 
  0 \to

  \tilde H_0(X) \to H_0(X) \stackrel{\epsilon}{\to}  \mathbb{Z} \to 0 
  \,.
$$

Here [[nLab:exact sequence|exactness]] says that all the morphisms $\tilde H_n(X) \to H_n(X)$ for positive $n$ are [[nLab:isomorphisms]]. Moreover, since $\mathbb{Z}$ is a [[nLab:free abelian group]], hence a [[nLab:projective object]], the remaining [[nLab:short exact sequence]]

$$
  0 \to \tilde H_0(X) \to H_0(X) \to \mathbb{Z} \to 0
$$

is [[nLab:split exact sequence|split]], by prop. \ref{SplittingLemma}, and hence $H_0(X) \simeq \tilde H_0(X) \oplus \mathbb{Z}$.

###### Proposition

For $X = *$ the [[nLab:point]], the morphism

$$
  H_0(\epsilon) \colon H_0(X) \to \mathbb{Z}

is an [[nLab:isomorphism]]. Accordingly the reduced homology of the point vanishes in every degree:

$$
  \tilde H_\bullet(*) \simeq 0

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the discussion in section [2)](#SimplicialHomology) we have that 

$$
  H_n(*) \simeq

       \mathbb{Z} & for \; n = 0
       \\
       0 & otherwise
    }
  \right.
  \,.
$$

Moreover, it is clear that $\epsilon \colon C_0(*) \to \mathbb{Z}$ is the [[nLab:identity]] map.

Now we can discuss the relation between reduced homology and relative homology.

###### Proposition

For $X$ an [[nLab:inhabited set|inhabited]] [[nLab:topological space]], its [[nLab:reduced singular homology]], def. \ref{ReducedSingularChainComplex}, coincides with its [[nLab:relative singular homology]] relative to any base point $x \colon * \to X$:

$$
  \tilde H_\bullet(X)
  \simeq
   H_\bullet(X,*)
  \,.
$$


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Consider the sequence of [[nLab:topological subspace]] inclusions

$$
  \emptyset \hookrightarrow * \stackrel{x}{\hookrightarrow} X
  \,.
$$

By prop. \ref{RelativeTripleHomologyLongExactSequence} this induces a [[nLab:long exact sequence]] of the form

$$
  \cdots
  \to
  H_{n+1}(*) \to H_{n+1}(X) \to H_{n+1}(X,*)
  \to
  H_n(*) \to H_n(X) \to H_n(X,*)
  \to

  \to 
  H_1(X) \to H_1(X,*) \to  H_0(*) \stackrel{H_0(x)}{\to}  H_0(X) \to H_n(X,*)
  \to 0
  \,.
$$

Here in positive degrees we have $H_n(*) \simeq 0$ and therefore [[nLab:exact sequence|exactness]] gives [[nLab:isomorphisms]]

$$
  H_n(X) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} H_n(X,*)\;\; \forall_{n \geq 1}
$$

and hence with prop. \ref{RelationBetweenReducedSingularAndSingular} isomorphisms

$$
  \tilde H_n(X) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} H_n(X,*)\;\; \forall_{n \geq 1}  
  \,.
$$

It remains to deal with the case in degree 0. To that end, observe that $H_0(x) \colon H_0(*) \to H_0(X)$ is a [[nLab:monomorphism]]: for this notice that we have a [[nLab:commuting diagram]]

$$
  \array{
     H_0(*) &\stackrel{id}{\to}& H_0(*)
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{H_0(x)}}\downarrow &{}^{\mathllap{H_0(f)}}\nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{H_0(\epsilon)}}_\simeq
     \\
     H_0(X) &\stackrel{H_0(\epsilon)}{\to}& \mathbb{Z}
  }
  \,,
$$

where $f \colon X \to *$ is the terminal map. 
That the outer square commutes means that $H_0(\epsilon) \circ H_0(x) = H_0(\epsilon)$ and hence the composite on the left is an [[nLab:isomorphism]]. This implies that $H_0(x)$ is an injection.

Therefore we have a [[nLab:short exact sequence]] as shown in the top of this diagram

$$
  \array{
    0 &\to& H_0(*) &\stackrel{H_0(x)}{\hookrightarrow}&
    H_0(X) &\stackrel{}{\to}& H_0(X,*)
    &\to&
    0
    \\
    && & {}_{\mathllap{\simeq}}\searrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{H_0(\epsilon)}} & 
   \\
   && && \mathbb{Z}
  }
  \,.
$$

Using this we finally compute

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \tilde H_0(X)
    & \coloneqq 
    ker H_0(\epsilon)
    \\
    & \simeq coker( H_0(x) )
    \\
    & \simeq H_0(X,*)
  \end{aligned}
  \,.

With this understanding of homology _relative to a point_ in hand, we can now characterize relative homology more generally.
From its definition in def. \ref{RelativeSingularHomology}, it is plausible that the relative homology group $H_n(X,A)$ provides information about the quotient topological space $X/A$. This is indeed true under mild conditions:

+-- {: .num_defn #GoodPair}
###### Definition

A [[nLab:topological subspace]] inclusion $A \hookrightarrow X$ is called a **good pair** if 

1. $A$ is [[nLab:closed subset|closed]] inside $X$;

1. $A$ has an [[nLab:neighbourhood]] $A \hookrightarrow U \hookrightarrow X$ such that $A \hookrightarrow U$ has a [[nLab:deformation retract]].

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #HomologyOfQuotientSpace}
###### Proposition

If $A \hookrightarrow X$ is a [[nLab:topological subspace]] inclusion which is _good_ in the sense of def. \ref{GoodPair}, then the $A$-relative singular homology of $X$ coincides with the [[nLab:reduced singular homology]], def. \ref{ReducedSingularChainComplex}, of the [[nLab:quotient space]] $X/A$: 

$$
  H_n(X/A)
  \simeq
  \tilde H_n(X , A)
 \,.
$$

=--

The proof of this is spelled out at _[Relative homology -- relation to quotient topological spaces](relative%20homology#RelationToQuotientTopologicalSpaces)_. It needs the proof of the _[Excision property](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/relative%20homology#Excision)_ of relative homology. While important, here we will not further dwell on this. The interested reader can find more information behind the above links.

With the general definition of relative homology in hand, we now consider the basic _cells_ such that _[[nLab:cell complexes]]_ built from such cells have tractable relative homology groups. Actually, up to [[nLab:weak homotopy equivalence]], _every_ [[nLab:Hausdorff topological space]] is given by such a [[nLab:cell complex]] and hence its relative homology, then called _[[nLab:cellular homology]]_, is a good tool for computing singular homology rather generally.

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ write

* $D^n \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^n \in $ [[nLab:Top]] for the standard $n$-[[nLab:disk]];

* $S^{n-1} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n} \in $ [[nLab:Top]] for the standard $(n-1)$-[[nLab:sphere]];

  (notice that the 0-sphere is the disjoint union of _two points_, $S^0 = * \coprod *$, and by definition the $(-1)$-sphere is the [[nLab:empty set]])


* $S^{-1} \hookrightarrow D^{n}$ for the [[nLab:continuous function]] that includes the $(n-1)$-sphere as the [[nLab:boundary]] of the $n$-disk.

###### Example

The [[nLab:reduced singular homology]] of the $n$-[[nLab:sphere]] $S^{n}$  equals the $S^{n-1}$-relative homology of the $n$-[[nLab:disk]] with respect to the canonical [[nLab:boundary]] inclusion $S^{n-1} \hookrightarrow D^n$: for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$

$$
  \tilde H_\bullet(S^n) \simeq H_\bullet(D^n, S^{n-1})

$$

=--

###### Proof

The $n$-[[nLab:sphere]] is [[nLab:homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to the $n$-[[nLab:disk]] with its entire [[nLab:boundary]] identified with a point:

$$
  S^n \simeq D^n/S^{n-1}
  \,.
$$

Moreover the boundary inclusion is a _good pair_ in the sense of def. \ref{GoodPair}. Therefore the example follows with prop. \ref{HomologyOfQuotientSpace}.

When forming [[nLab:cell complexes]] from disks, then each relative dimension will be a [[nLab:wedge sum]] of disks:


+-- {: .num_defn #WedgeSum}
###### Definition

For $\{x_i \colon * \to X_i\}_i$ a [[nLab:set]] of [[nLab:pointed topological spaces]], their _[[nLab:wedge sum]]_ $\vee_i X_i$ is the result of identifying all base points in their [[nLab:disjoint union]], hence the quotient

$$

  \left(

+-- {: .num_prop #ReducedHomologyRespectsWedgeSum}
###### Proposition

Let $\{* \to X_i\}_i$ be a set of [[nLab:pointed topological spaces]]. Write $\vee_i X_i \in Top$ for their [[nLab:wedge sum]] and write
$\iota_i \colon X_i \to \vee_i X_i$ for the canonical inclusion functions.


Then for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the homomorphism

$$
  (\tilde H_n(\iota_i))_i \colon \oplus_i \tilde H_n(X_i) \to \tilde H_n(\vee_i X_i)
$$

is an [[nLab:isomorphism]].

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By prop. \ref{HomologyOfQuotientSpace} the reduced homology of the wedge sum is equivalently the relative homology of the disjoint union of spaces relative to their disjoint union of basepoints

$$
  \tilde H_n(\vee_i X_i)
  \simeq
  H_n(\coprod_i X_i, \coprod_i *)
  \,.
$$  

The relative homology preserves these coproducts (sends them to [[nLab:direct sums]]) and so 

$$
  H_n(\coprod_i X_i, \coprod_i *)
  \simeq
  \oplus_i H_n(X_i, *)

The following defines topological spaces which are inductively built by gluing disks to each other.

+-- {: .num_defn #CWComplex} 
###### Definition

A **[[nLab:CW complex]] of [[nLab:dimension]] $(-1)$** is the [[nLab:empty set|empty]] [[nLab:topological space]].

By [[nLab:induction]], for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ a **[[nLab:CW complex]] of [[nLab:dimension]] $n$** is a [[nLab:topological space]] $X_{n}$ obtained from

1. a $CW$-complex $X_{n-1}$ of dimension $n-1$;

1. an index set $Cell(X)_n \in Set$;

1. a set of [[nLab:continuous maps]] (the **attaching maps**) $\{ f_i \colon S^{n-1} \to X_{n-1}\}_{i \in Cell(X)_n}$

as the [[nLab:pushout]] 

$$
  X_n 
   \simeq 
  \left(
    \coprod_{j \in Cell(X)_n} D^n
  \right) 
   \underset{j \in Cell(X)_n S^{n-1}}{\coprod} 
   X_n
$$

in

$$
  \array{
    \coprod_{j \in Cell(X)_{n}} S^{n-1} &\stackrel{(f_j)}{\to}& X_{n-1}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \coprod_{j \in Cell(X)_{n}} D^{n} &\to& X_{n} 
  }
  \,,
$$ 

hence as the topological space obtained from $X_{n-1}$ by gluing in $n$-disks $D^n$ for each $j \in Cell(X)_n$ along the given boundary inclusion $f_j \colon S^{n-1} \to X_{n-1}$.

By this construction, an $n$-dimensional CW-complex is canonically a _[[nLab:filtered topological space]]_, hence a sequence of [[nLab:topological subspace]] inclusions of the form

$$
  \emptyset \hookrightarrow X_0 \hookrightarrow X_1 \hookrightarrow \cdots \hookrightarrow X_{n-1} \hookrightarrow X_n
$$

which are the right vertical morphisms in the above pushout diagrams. 

A general **[[nLab:CW complex]]** $X$ then is a [[nLab:topological space]] which is the limiting space of a possibly infinite such sequence, hence a topological space given as the [[nLab:sequential colimit]] over a [[nLab:tower]] [[nLab:diagram]] each of whose morphisms is such a filter inclusion 

$$
  \emptyset \hookrightarrow X_0 \hookrightarrow X_1 \hookrightarrow \cdots \hookrightarrow X

The following basic facts about the [[nLab:singular homology]] of [[nLab:CW complexes]] are important.



Now we can state a variant of singular homology adapted to CW complexes which admits a more systematic way of computing its homology groups. First we observe the following.

+-- {: .num_prop #SkeletalRelativeSingularHomologyOfCW}
###### Proposition

The [[nLab:relative singular homology]], def. \ref{RelativeSingularHomology}, of the filtering degrees of a [[nLab:CW complex]] $X$, def. \ref{CWComplex}, is

$$
  H_n(X_k , X_{k-1})
  \simeq
  \left\{
    \array{
       \mathbb{Z}[Cells(X)_n] & if\; k = n
       \\
       0 & otherwise
    }
  \right.
  \,,
$$

where $\mathbb{Z}[Cells(X)_n]$ denotes the [[nLab:free abelian group]] on the set of $n$-cells.


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The inclusion $X_{k-1} \hookrightarrow X_k$ is a _good pair_ in the sense of def. \ref{GoodPair}. The quotient $X_k/X_{k-1}$ is by definition of CW-complexes a [[nLab:wedge sum]], def. \ref{WedgeSum}, of $k$-[[nLab:spheres]], one for each element in $Cell(X)_k$. Therefore by prop. \ref{HomologyOfQuotientSpace} we have an isomorphism $H_n(X_k , X_{k-1}) \simeq \tilde H_n( X_k / X_{k-1})$ with the [[nLab:reduced homology]] of this wedge sum. The statement then follows by the respect of reduced homology for wedge sums, prop. \ref{ReducedHomologyRespectsWedgeSum}.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #SingularHomologyOfCWComples} 
###### Proposition

For $X$ a [[nLab:CW complex]] with skeletal filtration $\{X_n\}_n$ as above, and with $k,n \in \mathbb{N}$ we have for the [[nLab:singular homology]] of $X$ that

$$
  (k \gt n) \Rightarrow (H_k(X_n) \simeq 0)
  \,.
$$

In particular if $X$ is a CW-complex of finite [[nLab:dimension]] $dim X$ (the maximum degree of cells), then 

$$
  (k \gt dim X) \Rightarrow (H_k(X) \simeq 0).
$$

Moreover, for $k \lt n$ the inclusion

$$
  H_k(X_n) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} H_k(X)
$$

is an [[nLab:isomorphism]] and for $k = n$ we have an isomorphism

$$
  image(H_n(X_n) \to H_n(X)) \simeq H_n(X)
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the [[nLab:long exact sequence]] in [[nLab:relative homology]], prop. \ref{RelativeHomologyLongExactSequence} we have an [[nLab:exact sequence]] of the form

$$
  H_{k+1}(X_n , X_{n-1})
  \to 
  H_k(X_{n-1})
  \to 
  H_k(X_n)
  \to 
  H_k(X_n, X_{n-1})
  \,.
$$

Now by prop. \ref{SkeletalRelativeSingularHomologyOfCW} the leftmost and rightmost homology groups here vanish when $k \neq n$ and $k \neq n-1$ and hence exactness implies that

$$
  H_k(X_{n-1})
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  H_k(X_n)
$$

is an [[nLab:isomorphism]] for $k \neq n,n-1$. This implies the first claims by [[nLab:induction]] on $n$.

Finally for the last claim use that the above exact sequence gives

$$
  H_{n-1+1}(X_n , X_{n-1})
  \to 
  H_{n-1}(X_{n-1})
  \to 
  H_{n-1}(X_n)
  \to 
  0
$$

and hence that with the above the map $H_{n-1}(X_{n-1}) \to H_{n-1}(X)$ is surjective.

=--

We can now discuss the _[[nLab:cellular homology]]_ of a [[nLab:CW complex]].

+-- {: .num_defn #CellularChainComplex} 
###### Definition

For $X$ a [[nLab:CW-complex]], def. \ref{CWComplex}, its
**cellular chain complex** $H_\bullet^{CW}(X) \in Ch_\bullet$ is the [[nLab:chain complex]] such that for $n \in \mathbb{N}$

* the [[nLab:abelian group]] of [[nLab:chains]] is the [[nLab:relative singular homology]] group, def. \ref{RelativeSingularHomology}, of $X_n \hookrightarrow X$ relative to $X_{n-1} \hookrightarrow X$:

  $$
    H_n^{CW}(X) \coloneqq H_n(X_n, X_{n-1})
    \,,
  $$

* the [[nLab:differential]] $\partial^{CW}_{n+1} \colon H_{n+1}^{CW}(X) \to H_n^{CW}(X)$ is the [[nLab:composition]]

  $$
    \partial^{CW}_n 
    \colon
    H_{n+1}(X_{n+1}, X_n) 
     \stackrel{\partial_n}{\to} 
    H_n(X_n) 
     \stackrel{i_n}{\to} 
    H_n(X_n, X_{n-1})
    \,,
  $$ 

  where $\partial_n$ is the [[nLab:boundary]] map of the [[nLab:singular chain complex]] and where $i_n$ is the morphism on [[nLab:relative homology]] induced from the canonical inclusion of pairs $(X_n, \emptyset) \to (X_n, X_{n-1})$. 

=--

+-- {: .num_prop} 
###### Proposition 

The composition $\partial^{CW}_{n} \circ \partial^{CW}_{n+1}$ of two differentials in def. \ref{CellularChainComplex} is indeed zero, hence $H^{CW}_\bullet(X)$ is indeed a [[nLab:chain complex]].

=-- 

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

On representative singular [[nLab:chains]] the morphism $i_n$ acts as the identity and hence $\partial^{CW}_{n} \circ \partial^{CW}_{n+1}$ acts as the double singular boundary, $\partial_{n} \circ \partial_{n+1} = 0$.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark} 
###### Remark

This means that

* a **cellular $n$-chain** is a singular $n$-chain required to sit in filtering degree $n$, hence in $X_n \hookrightarrow X$;

* a **cellular $n$-cycle** is a singular $n$-chain whose singular boundary is not necessarily 0, but is contained in filtering degree $(n-2)$, hence in $X_{n-2} \hookrightarrow X$.

* a **cellular $n$-boundary** is a singular $n$-chain which is the boundary of a singular $(n+1)$-chain coming from filtering degree $(n+1)$.

=--

This kind of situation -- chains that are cycles only up to lower filtering degree and boundaries that come from specified higher filtering degree -- has an evident generalization to higher relative filtering degrees. And in this greater generality the concept is of great pracrical relevance. Therefore before discussing cellular homology further now, we consider this more general "higher-order relative homology" that it suggests (namely the formalism of [[nLab:spectral sequences]]). After establishing a few fundamental facts about that we will come back in prop. \ref{SpectralSequenceOfCWComplex} below to analyse the above cellular situation using this conceptual tool.

First we abstract the structure on chain complexes that in the above example was induced by the CW-complex structure on the [[nLab:singular chain complex]].

+-- {: .num_defn #FilteredChainComplex}
###### Definition

The structure of a **[[nLab:filtered chain complex]]** in a [[nLab:chain complex]] $C_\bullet$ is a sequence of [[nLab:chain map]] inclusions

$$
  \cdots
  \hookrightarrow
  F_{p-1}C_\bullet \hookrightarrow F_p C_\bullet \hookrightarrow
  \cdots 
  \hookrightarrow
  C_\bullet
  \,.
$$

The **[[nLab:associated graded]] complex** of a filtered chain complex, denoted $G_\bullet C_\bullet$, is the collection of [[nLab:quotient]] chain complexes

$$
  G_p C_\bullet \coloneqq F_p C_\bullet / F_{p-1} C_\bullet
  \,.
$$

We say that element of $G_p C_\bullet$ are _in filtering degree_ $p$.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

In more detail this means that

1. $[\cdots \stackrel{\partial_{n}}{\to} C_n \stackrel{\partial_{n-1}}{\to} C_{n-1} \to \cdots]$ is a [[nLab:chain complex]], hence $\{C_n\}$ are [[nLab:objects]] in $\mathcal{A}$ ($R$-[[nLab:modules]]) and $\{\partial_n\}$ are [[nLab:morphisms]] (module [[nLab:homomorphisms]]) with $\partial_{n+1} \circ \partial_{n} = 0$;

1. For each $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ there is a [[nLab:filtered object|filtering]] $F_\bullet C_n$ on $C_n$ and all these filterings are compatible with the [[nLab:differentials]] in that 

   $$
     \partial(F_p C_n) \subset F_p C_{n-1}
   $$

1. The grading associated to the filtering is such that the $p$-graded elements are those in the [[nLab:quotient]]

   $$
     G_p C_n \coloneqq \frac{F_p C_n}{ F_{p-1} C_n}
     \,.
   $$

   Since the differentials respect the grading we have chain complexes $G_p C_\bullet$ in each filtering degree $p$.

=--

Hence elements in a filtered chain complex are **[[nLab:bigraded object|bi-graded]]**: they carry a degree as elements of $C_\bullet$ as usual, but now they also carry a filtering degree: for $p,q \in \mathbb{Z}$ we therefore also write

$$
  C_{p,q} \coloneqq F_p C_{p+q}
$$

and call this the collection of **$(p,q)$-chains** in the filtered chain complex.

Accordingly we have $(p,q)$-cycles and -boundaries. But for these we may furthermore refine to a notion where also the filtering degree of the boundaries is constrained:


+-- {: .num_defn #AlmostChainsCyclesBoundaries}
###### Definition

Let $F_\bullet C_\bullet$ be a [[nLab:filtered chain complex]].  Its [[nLab:associated graded]] chain complex is the set of chain complexes

$$
  G_p C_\bullet \coloneqq F_p C_\bullet / F_{p-1} C_\bullet
$$

for all $p$. 

Then for $r, p, q \in \mathbb{Z}$ we say that

1. $G_p C_{p+q}$ is the module of ***$(p,q)$-[[nLab:chains]]*** or of ***$(p+q)$-chains in filtering degree $p$***;

1. $\begin{aligned} Z^r_{p,q}  & \coloneqq \left\{ c \in G_p C_{p+q} | \partial c = 0 \, mod F_{p-r} C_{\bullet} \right\} \\ & =  \left\{ c \in F_p C_{p+q} | \partial(c) \in F_{p-r} C_{p+q-1} \right\}/ F_{p-1}C_{p+q} \end{aligned}$

   is the module of ***$r$-almost $(p,q)$-[[nLab:cycles]]*** (the $(p+q)$-chains whose differential vanishes modulo terms of filtering degree $p-r$);


1. $B^{r}_{p,q} \coloneqq \partial(F_{p+r-1} C_{p+q+1}) \,,$

   is the module of **$r$-almost $(p,q)$-[[nLab:boundaries]]**.

=--

Similarly we set

$$
  Z^\infty_{p,q} \coloneqq \{c \in F_p C_{p + q} | \partial c = 0 \}/F_{p-1}C_{p+q}
  = 
  Z(G_p C_{p+q})
$$

$$
  B^\infty_{p,q} \coloneqq \partial( F_p C_{p+q+1} )
  \,.
$$

From this definition we immediately have that the differentials $\partial \colon C_{p+q} \to C_{p+q-1}$ restrict to the $r$-almost cycles as follows:

+-- {: .num_prop #DifferentialsOnAlmostChains}
###### Proposition

The [[nLab:differentials]] of $C_\bullet$ restrict on $r$-almost cycles to homomorphisms of the form

$$
  \partial^r 
   \colon
  Z^r_{p,q}
  \to
  Z^r_{p-r, q+r-1}
  \,.
$$

These are still [[nLab:differentials]]: $\partial^2 = 0$.

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the very definition of $Z^r_{p,q}$ it consists of elements in filtering degree $p$ on which $\partial$ decreases the filtering degree to $p-r$. Also by definition of differential on a chain complex, $\partial$ decreases the actual degree $p+q$ by one. This explains that $\partial$ restricted to $Z^r_{p,q}$ lands in $Z^\bullet_{p-r,q+r-1}$. 
Now the image constists indeed of actual boundaries, not just $r$-almost boundaries. But since actual boundaries are in particular $r$-almost boundaries, we may take the [[nLab:codomain]] to be $Z^r_{p-r,q+r-1}$.

=--

As before, we will in general index these differentials by their [[nLab:codomain]] and hence write in more detail

$$
  \partial^r 
   \colon
  Z^r_{p,q}
  \to
  Z^r_{p-r, q+r-1}
  \,.
$$


+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

We have a sequence of canonical inclusions

$$
  B^0_{p,q}

  \cdots
  B^\infty_{p,q}

  \cdots 
  \hookrightarrow
  Z^1_{p,q}

  Z^0_{p,q}

The following observation is elementary, and yet this is what drives the theory of [[nLab:spectral sequences]], as it shows that almost cycles may be computed iteratively by homological means themselves.

+-- {: .num_prop #KernelsInsideAlmostCycles}
###### Proposition

The $(r+1)$-almost cycles are the $\partial^r$-[[nLab:kernel]] inside the $r$-almost cycles:

$$
  Z^{r+1}_{p,q}
  \simeq 
  ker( Z^r_{p,q} \stackrel{\partial^r}{\to} Z^r_{p-r, q+r-1} )
  \,.
$$

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

An element $c \in F_p C_{p+q}$ represents 

1. an element in $Z^r_{p,q}$ if $\partial c \in F_{p-r} C_{p+q-1}$

1. an element in $Z^{r+1}_{p,q}$ if even $\partial c \in F_{p-r-1} C_{p+q-1} \hookrightarrow F_{p-r} C_{p+q-1}$.

The second condition is equivalent to $\partial c$ representing the 0-element in the quotient $F_{p-r}C_{p+q-1}/ F_{p-r-1}C_{p+q-1}$. But this is in turn equivalent to $\partial c$ being 0 in $Z^r_{p-r,q+r-1} \subset F_{p-r} C_{p+q-1} / F_{p-r-1} C_{p+q-1}$.

With a definition of almost-cycles and almost-boundaries, of course we are now interested in the corresponding homology groups:

+-- {: .num_defn #ExplicitForm}
###### Definition

For $r, p, q \in \mathbb{Z}$ define the **$r$-almost $(p,q)$-[[nLab:chain homology]]** of the filtered complex to be the [[nLab:quotient]] of the $r$-almost $(p,q)$-cycles by the $r$-almost $(p,q)$-boundaries, def. \ref{AlmostChainsCyclesBoundaries}:

$$

With definition \ref{ExplicitForm} we have that
$E^{r+1}_{\bullet, \bullet}$ is the $\partial^r$-[[nLab:chain homology]] of $E^r_{\bullet, \bullet}$:

$$

This structure on the collection of $r$-almost cycles of a filtered chain complex thus obtained is called a _[[nLab:spectral sequence]]_:

+-- {: .num_defn #SpectralSequence}
###### Definition

A **spectral sequence** of $R$-[[nLab:modules]] is

1. a set $\{E_{p,q}^r\}_{p,q,r \in \mathbb{Z}}$ of $R$-modules;

1. a set $\{ \partial^r_{p,q} \colon E_{p,q}^{r} \to E^r_{p-r, q+r-1} \}_{r,p,q \in \mathbb{Z}}$ of [[nLab:homomorphisms]]

such that

1. the $\partial^r$s are [[nLab:differentials]]: $\forall_{p,q,r}  (\partial^r_{p-r,q+r-1} \circ \partial^r_{p,q} = 0)$;

1. the modules $E^{r+1}_{p,q}$ are the $\partial^r$-[[nLab:homology]] of the modules in relative degree $r$:

   $$
     \forall_{r,p,q} 
     \left(
       E^{r+1}_{p,q} \simeq \frac{ker(\partial^r_{p-r,q+r-1})}{im(\partial^r_{p, q})}
      \right)
     \,.
   $$ 

One says that $E^r_{\bullet,\bullet}$ is the **$r$-page** of the spectral sequence. 

=--

Since this turns out to be a useful structure to make explicit, as the above motivation should already indicate, one introduces the following terminology and basic facts to talk about spectral sequences.


+-- {: .num_defn #LimitTerm}
###### Definition

Let $\{E^r_{p,q}\}_{r,p,q}$ be a [[nLab:spectral sequence]], def. \ref{SpectralSequence}, such that for each $p,q$ there is $r(p,q)$ such that for all $r \geq r(p,q)$ we have

$$
  E^{r \geq r(p,q)}_{p,q} \simeq E^{r(p,q)}_{p,q}
  \,.
$$

Then one says that

1. the [[nLab:bigraded object]]

   $$
     E^\infty 
      \coloneqq 
     \{E^\infty_{p,q}\}_{p,q} \coloneqq \{ E^{r(p,q)}_{p,q} \}_{p,q}

   is the **limit term** of the spectral sequence;

*  the spectral sequence **abuts** to $E^\infty$.

+-- {: .num_example #Degeneration}
###### Example

If for a spectral sequence there is $r_s$ such that all [[nLab:differentials]] on pages after $r_s$ vanish, $\partial^{r \geq r_s} = 0$, then $\{E^{r_s}\}_{p,q}$ is a limit term for the spectral sequence. One says in this cases that the spectral sequence **degenerates** at $r_s$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the defining relation

$$
  E^{r+1}_{p,q} \simeq ker(\partial^r_{p-r,q+r-1})/im(\partial^r_{p,q}) = E^r_{pq}
$$

the spectral sequence becomes constant in $r$ from $r_s$ on if all the differentials vanish, so that $ker(\partial^r_{p,q}) = E^r_{p,q}$ for all $p,q$.

+-- {: .num_example #Collaps}
###### Example

If for a [[nLab:spectral sequence]] $\{E^r_{p,q}\}_{r,p,q}$ there is $r_s \geq 2$ such that the $r_s$th page is concentrated in a single row or a single column, then the spectral sequence degenerates on this pages, example \ref{Degeneration}, hence this page is a limit term, def. \ref{LimitTerm}. One says in this case that the spectral sequence **collapses** on this page.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

For $r \geq 2$ the [[nLab:differentials]] of the spectral sequence

$$
  \partial^r \colon E^r_{p,q} \to E^r_{p-r, q+r-1}
$$ 

have [[nLab:domain]] and [[nLab:codomain]] necessarily in different rows an columns (while for $r = 1$ both are in the same row and for $r = 0$ both coincide). Therefore if all but one row or column vanish, then all these differentials vanish.

+-- {: .num_defn #Convergence}
###### Definition

A [[nLab:spectral sequence]] $\{E^r_{p,q}\}_{r,p,q}$ is said to **converge** to a [[nLab:graded object]] $H_\bullet$ with [[nLab:filtered chain complex|filtering]] $F_\bullet H_\bullet$, traditionally denoted

$$
  E^r_{p,q} \Rightarrow H_\bullet
  \,,
$$

if the [[nLab:associated graded]] complex $\{G_p H_{p+q}\}_{p,q} \coloneqq \{F_p H_{p+q} / F_{p-1} H_{p+q}\}$ of $H$ is the limit term of $E$, def. \ref{LimitTerm}:

###### Remark

In practice spectral sequences are often referred to via their first non-trivial page, often also the page at which it collapses, def. \ref{Collaps}, often already the second page. Then one tends to use notation such as

$$
  E^2_{p,q} \Rightarrow H_\bullet
$$

to be read as "There is a spectral sequence whose second page is as shown on the left and which converges to a filtered object as shown on the right."

+-- {: .num_defn #BoundedSpectralSequence}
###### Definition

A spectral sequence $\{E^r_{p,q}\}$ is called a **bounded spectral sequence** if for all $n,r \in \mathbb{Z}$ the number of non-vanishing terms of total degree $n$, hence of the form $E^r_{k,n-k}$, is finite.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #QuadrantSpectralSequence}
###### Example

A [[nLab:spectral sequence]] $\{E^r_{p,q}\}$ is called

* a **first quadrant spectral sequence** if all terms except possibly for $p,q \geq 0$ vanish;

* a **third quadrant spectral sequence** if all terms except possibly for $p,q \leq 0$ vanish.

Such spectral sequences are bounded, def. \ref{BoundedSpectralSequence}.

=--



+-- {: .num_prop #BoundedSpectralSequenceHasLimitTerm}
###### Proposition

A bounded spectral sequence, def. \ref{BoundedSpectralSequence}, has a limit term, def. \ref{LimitTerm}.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First notice that if a spectral sequence has at most $N$ non-vanishing terms of total degree $n$ on page $r$, then all the following pages have at most at these positions non-vanishing terms, too, since these are the homologies of the previous terms.

Therefore for a bounded spectral sequence for each $n$ there is $L(n) \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $E^r_{p,n-p} = 0$ for all $p \leq L(n)$ and all $r$. Similarly there is $T(n) \in \mathbb{Z}$ such $E^r_{n-q,q} = 0$ for all $q \leq T(n)$ and all $r$.

We claim then that the limit term of the bounded spectral sequence is in position $(p,q)$ given by the value $E^r_{p,q}$ for 

$$
  r \gt max(  p-L(p+q-1), q + 1 - L(p+q+1) )
  \,.
$$

This is because for such $r$ we have

1. $E^r_{p-r, q+r-1} = 0$ because $p-r \lt L(p+q-1)$, and hence the [[nLab:kernel]] $ker(\partial^r_{p-r,q+r-1}) = 0$ vanishes;

1. $E^r_{p+r, q-r+1} = 0$ because $q-r + 1 \lt T(p+q+1)$, and hence the [[nLab:image]] $im(\partial^r_{p,q}) = 0$ vanishes.

Therefore

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    E^{r+1}_{p,q} 
    &= 
    ker(\partial^r_{p-r,q+r-1})/im(\partial^r_{p,q})
    \\
    & \simeq E^r_{p,q}/0
    \\
    & \simeq E^r_{p,q}
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

The central statement about the notion of the spectral sequence of a filtered chain complex then is the following proposition. It says that the iterative computation of higher order relative homology indeed in the limit computes the genuine homology.

$$
  F_p H_\bullet(C) 
   \coloneqq
  image( H_\bullet(F_p C) \to H_\bullet(C) )
  \,.
$$

This defines a [[nLab:filtered object|filtering]] $F_\bullet H_\bullet(C)$ of the homology, regarded as a graded object.

+-- {: .num_prop #ConvergingToGenuineHomology}
###### Proposition

If the [[nLab:spectral sequence of a filtered complex]] $F_\bullet C_\bullet$ of prop. \ref{ExplicitDefIsIndeedSpectralSequ} has a limit term, def. \ref{LimitTerm} then it converges, def. \ref{Convergence}, to the chain homology of $C_\bullet$

$$
  E^r_{p,q} \Rightarrow H_{p+q}(C_\bullet)
  \,,
$$

i.e. for sufficiently large $r$ we have

$$
  E^r_{p,q} \simeq G_p H_{p+q}(C) 
  \,,
$$

where on the right we have the [[nLab:associated graded object]] of the filtering of def. \ref{FilteringOnHomology}.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By assumption, there is for each $p,q$ an $r(p,q)$ such that for all $r \geq r(p,q)$ the $r$-almost cycles and $r$-almost boundaries, def. \ref{AlmostChainsCyclesBoundaries}, in $F_p C_{p+q}$ are the ordinary [[nLab:cycles]] and [[nLab:boundaries]]. Therefore for $r \geq r(p,q)$ def. \ref{ExplicitForm} gives $E^r_{p,q} \simeq G_p H_{p+q}(C)$.


=--

This says what these spectral sequences are converging to. For computations it is also important to know how they start out for low $r$. We can generally characterize $E^r_{p,q}$ for very low values of $r$ simply as follows:

+-- {: .num_prop #SpectralSequencePagesForLowr}
###### Proposition

We have

* $E^0_{p,q} = G_p C_{p+q} = F_p C_{p+q} / F_{p-1} C_{p+q}$ 

  is the [[nLab:associated graded|associated p-graded]] piece of $C_{p+q}$;

* $E^1_{p,q} = H_{p+q}(G_p C_\bullet)$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

For $r = 0$ def. \ref{ExplicitForm} restricts to

$$
  E^0_{p,q} = \frac{ F_p C_{p+q}}{F_{p-1} C_{p+q}} = G_p C_{p+q}
$$

because for $c \in F_p C_{p+q}$ we automatically also have $\partial c \in F_p C_{p+q}$ since the differential respects the filtering degree by assumption. 

For $r = 1$ def. \ref{ExplicitForm} gives 

$$
  E^1_{p,q} = \frac{\{c \in G_p C_{p+q} | \partial c = 0 \in G_p C_{p+q}\} }{\partial(F_p C_{p+q})} = H_{p+q} (G_p C_\bullet)
  \,.
$$

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

There is, in general, a decisive difference between the homology of the associated graded complex $H_{p+q}(G_p C_\bullet)$ and the associated graded piece of the genuine homology $G_p H_{p+q}(C_\bullet)$: in the former the differentials of cycles are required to vanish only up to terms in lower degree, but in the latter they are required to vanish genuinely. The latter expression is instead the value of the spectral sequence for $r \to \infty$, see prop. \ref{ConvergingToGenuineHomology} below.

These general facts now allow us, as a first simple example for the application of [[nLab:spectral sequences]] to see transparently that the [[nLab:cellular homology]] of a CW complex, def. \ref{CellularChainComplex}, coincides with its genuine [[nLab:singular homology]].

First notice that of course the structure of a [[nLab:CW-complex]] on a [[nLab:topological space]] $X$, def. \ref{CWComplex} naturally induces on its [[nLab:singular simplicial complex]] $C_\bullet(X)$ the structure of a [[nLab:filtered chain complex]], def. \ref{FilteredChainComplex}:

$$

for the [[nLab:singular chain complex]] of $X_p \hookrightarrow X$. The given  [[nLab:topological subspace]] inclusions $X_p \hookrightarrow X_{p+1}$ induce [[nLab:chain map]] inclusions $F_p C_\bullet(X) \hookrightarrow F_{p+1} C_\bullet(X)$ and these equip the singular chain complex $C_\bullet(X)$ of $X$ with the structure of a bounded [[nLab:filtered chain complex]]

(If $X$ is of finite [[nLab:dimension]] $dim X$ then this is a bounded filtration.)

The spectral sequence $\{E^r_{p,q}(X)\}$ of singular chains in a [[nLab:CW complex]] $X$, def. \ref{SpectralSequenceOfSingularChainsInCWComplex} converges, def. \ref{Convergence}, to the [[nLab:singular homology]] of $X$:

###### Proof

The spectral sequence $\{E^r_{p,q}(X)\}$ is clearly a first-quadrant spectral sequence, def. \ref{QuadrantSpectralSequence}. Therefore it is a bounded spectral sequence, def. \ref{BoundedSpectralSequence} and hence has a limit term, def. \ref{BoundedSpectralSequenceHasLimitTerm}. So the statement follows with prop. \ref{ConvergingToGenuineHomology}.

* $r = 1$ -- $E^1_{p,q}(X) \simeq H_{p+q}(X_p, X_{p-1})$ is the $X_{p-1}$-[[nLab:relative singular homology]], def. \ref{RelativeSingularHomology}, of $X_p$;

As a result of these general considerations we now obtain the promised isomorphism between the cellular homology and the singular homology of a CW-complex $X$:

###### Corollary

For $X \in $ [[nLab:Top]] a [[nLab:CW complex]], def. \ref{CWComplex}, its [[nLab:cellular homology]], def. \ref{CellularChainComplex} $H^{CW}_\bullet(X)$ coincides with its singular homology $H_\bullet(X)$, def. \ref{SingularHomology}:  

$$ 
  H^{CW}_\bullet(X) \simeq H_\bullet(X)

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the third item of prop. \ref{PagesInTheSpectralSequenceOfTheFilteredSingularComplex} the $(r = 2)$-page of the spectral sequence $\{E^r_{p,q}(X)\}$ is concentrated in the $(q = 0)$-row and hence it collapses there, def. \ref{Collaps}. Accordingly we have 

$$
  E^\infty_{p,q}(X) \simeq E^2_{p,q}(X)
$$

for all $p,q$. By the third and fourth item of prop. \ref{PagesInTheSpectralSequenceOfTheFilteredSingularComplex} this non-trivial only for $q = 0$ and there it is equivalently

$$
  G_p H_{p}(X) \simeq H^{CW}_p(X)
  \,.
$$

Finally observe that $G_p H_p(X) \simeq H_p(X)$ by the definition of the filtering on the homology, def. \ref{FilteringOnHomology}, and using prop. \ref{SingularHomologyOfCWComples}.

A [[filtered spectrum]] is a [[spectrum]] $X$ equipped with a sequence $X_\bullet \colon (\mathbb{N}, \gt) \longrightarrow Spectra$  of spectra of the form

###### Remark

More generally a [[filtered object in an (infinity,1)-category|filtering]] on an object $X$ in (stable or not) [[homotopy theory]] is a $\mathbb{Z}$-graded sequence $X_\bullet $ such that $X$ is the [[homotopy colimit]]  $X\simeq \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim} X_\bullet$. But for the present purpose we stick with the simpler special case of def. \ref{FilteredSpectrum}.

###### Remark

There is _no_ condition on the [[morphisms]] in def. \ref{FilteredSpectrum}. In particular, they are _not_ required to be [[n-monomorphisms]] or [[n-epimorphisms]] for any $n$. 

On the other hand, while they are also not explicitly required to have a presentation by [[cofibrations]] or [[fibrations]], this follows automatically: by the existence of [[model structures for spectra]], every filtering on a spectrum is equivalent to one in which all morphisms are represented by [[cofibrations]] or by [[fibrations]]. 

This means that we may think of a filtration on a spectrum $X$ in the sense of def. \ref{FilteredSpectrum} as equivalently being a [[tower of fibrations]] over $X$.

###### Remark

Given a [[filtered spectrum]] as in def. \ref{FilteredSpectrum},
write $A_k$ for the [[homotopy cofiber]] of its $k$th stage, such as to obtain the diagram

To break this down into invariants, apply the [[stable homotopy groups]]-[[functor]]. This yields a diagram of $\mathbb{Z}$-[[graded abelian groups]] of the form

Here each hook at stage $k$ extends to a [[long exact sequence of homotopy groups]] via [[connecting homomorphisms]] $\delta_\bullet^k$

If we understand the [[connecting homomorphism]]

$$
  \delta_k \colon \pi_\bullet(A_k) \longrightarrow \pi_\bullet(X_{k+1})

as a morphism of degree -1, then all this information fits into one diagram of the form

where each triangle is a rolled-up incarnation of a [[long exact sequence of homotopy groups]] (and in particular is _not_ a commuting diagram!).

If we furthermore consider the [[bigraded object|bigraded]] [[abelian groups]] $\pi_\bullet(X_\bullet)$ and $\pi_\bullet(A_\bullet)$, then this information may further be rolled-up to a single diagram of the form

$$

where the morphisms $\pi_\bullet(f_\bullet)$, $\pi_\bullet(cofib(f_\bullet))$ and $\delta$ have bi-degree $(0,-1)$, $(0,0)$ and $(-1,1)$, respectively.

Here it is convenient to shift the bigrading, equivalently, by setting

The collection of this "un-rolled" data into a single diagram of [[abelian groups]] is called the corresponding _[[exact couple]]_.


+-- {: .num_defn #ExactCouple}
###### Definition

An _[[exact couple]]_ is a [[diagram]] (non-commuting) of [[abelian groups]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    \mathcal{D}
    &\stackrel{i}{\longrightarrow}&
    \mathcal{D}
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{k}}\nwarrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{j}}

    && \mathcal{E}
  }
  \,,
$$

such that this is [[exact sequence]] exact in each position, hence such that the [[kernel]] of every [[morphism]] is the [[image]] of the preceding one.

=--


The concept of exact couple so far just collects the sequences of long exact sequences given by a filtration. Next we turn to extracting information from this sequence of sequences.

+-- {: .num_remark #Observingd1}
###### Remark

The sequence of long exact sequences in remark \ref{UnrolledExactCoupleOfAFiltrationOnASpectrum} is inter-locking, in that every $\pi_{t-s}(X_s)$ appears _twice_:

$$
  \array{
    && & \searrow && \nearrow
    \\
    && && \pi_{t-s-1}(X_{s+1})
    \\
    && & {}^{\mathllap{\delta_{t-s}^s}}\nearrow 
    && \searrow^{\mathrlap{\pi_{t-s-1}(cofib(f_{s+1}))}}
    && && && \nearrow
    \\
    && \pi_{t-s}(A_s) && \underset{def: \;\;d_1^{s,t}}{\longrightarrow} && \pi_{t-s-1}(A_{s+1})
    && \stackrel{def: \; d_1^{s+1,t}}{\longrightarrow} && \pi_{t-s-2}(A_{s+2})
    \\
    & \nearrow && && && {}_{\mathllap{\delta_{t-s-1}^{s+1}}}\searrow 
    && \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\pi_{t-s-2}(cofib(f_{s+2}))}}
    \\
    && && && && \pi_{t-s-2}(X_{s+2})
    \\
    && && && & \nearrow && \searrow
  }
$$

This gives rise to the horizontal composites $d_1^{s,t}$, as show above, and by the fact that the diagonal sequences are long exact, these are differentials: $d_1^2 = 0$, hence give a [[chain complex]]:

$$
  \array{
    \cdots & \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}
    && \pi_{t-s}(A_s) && \overset{d_1^{s,t}}{\longrightarrow} && \pi_{t-s-1}(A_{s+1})
    && \stackrel{d_1^{s+1,t}}{\longrightarrow} && \pi_{t-s-2}(A_{s+2})
    &&\longrightarrow & \cdots
  }
  \,.
$$

We read off from the interlocking long exact sequences what these differentials _mean_: an element $c \in \pi_{t-s}(A_s)$ lifts to an element $\hat c \in \pi_{t-s-1}(X_{s+2})$ precisely if $d_1 c = 0$:

$$
  \array{
    &\hat c \in & \pi_{t-s-1}(X_{s+2})
    \\
    && & \searrow^{\mathrlap{\pi_{t-s-1}(f_{s+1})}} 
    \\
    && && \pi_{t-s-1}(X_{s+1})
    \\
    && & {}^{\mathllap{\delta_{t-s}^s}}\nearrow 
    && \searrow^{\mathrlap{\pi_{t-s-1}(cofib(f_{s+1}))}}
    \\
    & c \in  & \pi_{t-s}(A_s) && \underset{d_1^{s,t}}{\longrightarrow} && \pi_{t-s-1}(A_{s+1})
  }
$$

This means that the [[cochain cohomology]] of the complex $(\pi_{\bullet}(A_\bullet), d_1)$ produces elements of $\pi_\bullet(X_\bullet)$ and hence of $\pi_\bullet(X)$.

In order to organize this observation, notice that in terms of the exact couple of remark \ref{UnrolledExactCoupleOfAFiltrationOnASpectrum}, the differential 

$$
  d_1^{s,t}  \;\coloneqq \; \pi_{t-s-1}(cofib(f_{s+1})) \circ \delta_{t-s}^s
$$

is a component of the composite

As we pass to derived exact couples, by def. \ref{DerivedExactCouple}, 
the bidegree of $i$ and $k$ is preserved, but that of $j$ increases by $(1,1)$ in each step, since

$$
  deg(\tilde j) = deg( j \circ im(i)^{-1}) = deg(j) + (1,1)
  \,.
$$


Therefore the induced [[spectral sequence]] has differentials of the form

$$
  d_r \;\colon\; \mathcal{E}_r^{s,t} \longrightarrow \mathcal{E}_r^{s+r, t+r-1}

   1. a (long) _exact sequence_ if the induced sequence of homotopy functors, def. \ref{HomotopyFunctor}, is a [[long exact sequence]] in $[HoSpectra,Ab]$;

   2. (for $n = 2$) a _short exact sequence_ if

      $$

   1. a _monomorphism_ if $0 \longrightarrow A \longrightarrow B$ is an exact sequence;

   1. an _epimorphism_ if $A \longrightarrow B \longrightarrow 0$ is an exact sequence.

For $E$ a [[ring spectrum]], then a sequence of spectra is (long/short) _$E$-exact_ and a morphism is epi/mono, respectively, if becomes long/short exact or epi/mono, respectively, after taking [[smash product of spectra|smash product]] with $E$.

**Abstract.** _The [[(infinity,1)-category|category]] of [[generalized cohomology theories]] equipped with a universal "[[complex oriented cohomology theory|complex]] [[orientation in generalized cohomology|orientation]]" happens to unify within it the abstract structure theory of [[stable homotopy theory]] with the concrete richness of the [[differential topology]] of [[cobordism theory]] and of the [[arithmetic geometry]] of [[formal group laws]] (of [[higher Jacobians]]), such as [[elliptic curves]]. In the seminar we work through classical results in [[algebraic topology]], organized such as to give in the end a first glimpse of the modern picture of [[chromatic homotopy theory]]._


**Literature.** ([Kochmann 96](#Kochmann96)).


**Outline.** We start with two classical topics of [[algebraic topology]] that first run independently in parallel:

* [S1) Generalized cohomology](#S1GeneralizedCohomology)

* [S2) Cobordism theory](#S2CobordismTheory)

The development of either of these happens to give rise to the concept of _[[spectra]]_ and via this concept it turns out that both topics are intimately related. The unification of both is our third topic

* [S3) Complex oriented cohomology](#ComplexOrientedCohomologyTheory)

$\,$


### **Part S1) Generalized cohomology**
 {#S1GeneralizedCohomology}

**Idea.** The concept that makes [[algebraic topology]] be about methods of [[homological algebra]] applied to [[topology]] is that of [[generalized homology]] and [[generalized cohomology]]: these are [[covariant functors]] or [[contravariant functors]], respectively,

  Spaces \longrightarrow Ab^{\mathbb{Z}}
$$

from (sufficiently nice) [[topological spaces]] to $\mathbb{Z}$-[[graded abelian groups]], such that a few key properties of the [[homotopy types]] of topological spaces is preserved as one passes them from [[Ho(Top)]] to the much more tractable [[abelian category]] [[Ab]].

#### Generalized cohomology functors
 {#GeneralizedHomologyAndCohomologyFunctors}

**Idea.** A [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] theory is such a contravariant functor which satisfies the key properties exhibited by [[ordinary cohomology]] (as computed for instance by [[singular cohomology]]), notably [[homotopy invariance]] and [[excision]], _except_ that its value on the point is not required to be concentrated in degree 0. Dually for [[generalized homology]]. There are two versions of the axioms, one for [[reduced cohomology]], and while not quite equivalent, they are closely related.

An important example of a generalised cohomology theory other than [[ordinary cohomology]] is [[topological K-theory]]. The other two examples of key relevance below are [[cobordism cohomology]] and [[stable cohomotopy]].

**Literature.** ([Aguilar-Gitler-Prieto 02, section 12](#AguilarGitlerPrieto02), [Kochmann 96, 3.4](#Kochmann96), [Karpova 09](#Karpova09))



#### Brown representability theorem


**Idea.** Given any [[functor]] such as the generalized (co)homology functor [above](#GeneralizedHomologyAndCohomologyFunctors), an important question to ask is whether it is a _[[representable functor]]_. Due to the $\mathbb{Z}$-grading and the [[suspension isomorphisms]], if a generalized (co)homology functor is representable at all, it must be represented by a $\mathbb{Z}$-indexed sequence of [[pointed topological spaces]] such that the [[reduced suspension]] of one is comparable to the next one in the list. This is a _[[spectrum]]_.

Whitehead observed that indeed every [[spectrum]] represents a generalized (co)homology theory.  The _[[Brown representability theorem]]_ states that, conversely, every generalized (co)homology theory is represented by a spectrum.

Due to [[phantom maps]], there remains a subtle difference between generalized (co)homology functors and the spectra which represent them: a little bit of information is lost as one passes from the spectrum to its cohomology functor (the [[Yoneda lemma]] does not fully apply here, since a (co)homology functor is equipped with the extra structure of the [[natural isomorphism|natural]] [[suspension isomorphism]]).

In applications and modern theory, it is mostly the spectra that matter, and hence the Brown representability theory is used to transfer extra structure on spectra to extra structure on cohomology theories. For instance a _[[multiplicative cohomology theory]]_ is one which is represented by a [[ring spectrum]].

There is a slight refinement of the concept of generalized homology functors to that of "[[excisive ∞-functors]]". These are fully equivalent to spectra.

**Literature.** ([Aguilar-Gitler-Prieto 02, section 12](#AguilarGitlerPrieto02), [Kochmann 96, 3.4](#Kochmann96))


#### Milnor exact sequence
 {#S2MilnorExactSequence}


**Idea.** One tool for computing [[generalized cohomology]] [[cohomology groups|groups]] via "[[inverse limits]]" are _[[Milnor exact sequences]]_. For instance the generalized cohomology of the [[classifying space]] $B U(1)$ plays a key role in the [[complex oriented cohomology]]-theory discussed [below](#ComplexOrientedCohomologyTheory), and via the equivalence $B U(1) \simeq \mathbb{C}P^\infty$ to the [[homotopy type]] of the infinite [[complex projective space]], which is the [[direct limit]] of finite dimensional projective spaces $\mathbb{C}P^n$, this is an [[inverse limit]] of the generalized cohomology groups of the $\mathbb{C}P^n$s. But what really matters here is the [[derived functor]] of the [[limit]]-operation -- the  [[homotopy limit]] -- and the [[Milnor exact sequence]] expresses how the naive limits receive corrections from higher "[[lim^1]]-terms". In practice one mostly proceeds by verifying conditions under which these corrections happen to disappear, these are the _[[Mittag-Leffler conditions]]_.

We need this for instance for the computation of [[Conner-Floyd Chern classes]] [below](#ConnerFloydChernClasses).

**Literature.** ([Goerss-Jardine 96, section VI.2](#GoerssJardine96), [Kochmann 96, section 4.2](#Kochmann96))


#### Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence

**Idea.** Another important tool for computing [[generalized cohomology]] is to reduce it to the computation of [[ordinary cohomology]] with [[coefficients]]. Given a [[generalized cohomology theory]] $E$, there is a [[spectral sequence]] known as the _[[Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence]]_ (AHSS) which serves to compute $E$-cohomology of $F$-[[fiber bundles]] over a [[simplicial complex]] $X$ in terms of [[ordinary cohomology]] with [[coefficients]] in the generalized cohomology $E^\bullet(F)$ of the fiber. For $E = $ [[HA]] this is known as the _[[Serre spectral sequence]]_.

The [[Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence]] in turn is a consequence of the "[[Cartan-Eilenberg spectral sequence]]" which arises from the [[exact couple]] of [[relative cohomology]] groups of the skeleta of the CW-complex, and whose first page is the relative cohomology groups for codimension-1 skeleta.

We need the AHSS for instance for the computation of [[Conner-Floyd Chern classes]] [below](#ConnerFloydChernClasses).

### **Part S2) Cobordism theory**
 {#S2CobordismTheory}

**Idea.** As one passes from [[abelian groups]] to [[spectra]], a miracle happens: even though the latter are just the proper embodiment of [[linear algebra]] in the context of [[homotopy theory]] ("[[higher algebra]]") their inspection reveals that spectra natively know about deep phenomena of [[differential topology]], [[index theory]] and in fact [[string theory]] (for instance via a close relation between _[[genera and partition functions - table|genera and partition functions]]_). 

A strong manifestation of this phenomenon comes about in [[complex oriented cohomology theory]]/[[chromatic homotopy theory]] that we eventually come to [below](#ComplexOrientedCohomologyTheory). It turns out to be higher algebra over the complex Thom spectrum [[MU]]. 

Here we first concentrate on its real avatar, the [[Thom spectrum]] [[MO]]. The seminal result of [[Thom's theorem]] says that the [[stable homotopy groups]] of [[MO]] form the [[cobordism ring]] of [[cobordism]]-[[equivalence classes]] of [[manifolds]]. In the course of discussing this _[[cobordism theory]]_ one encounters various phenomena whose complex version also governs the complex oriented cohomology theory that we are interested in [below](#ComplexOrientedCohomologyTheory).

**Literature.** ([Kochmann 96, chapter I and sections II.2, II6](Kochmann96)). A quick efficient account is also in ([Malkiewich 11](#Malkiewich11)).


#### Classifying spaces, $G$-Structure and Bordism
 {#ClassifyingSpaces}

**Idea.** Every [[manifold]] $X$ of [[dimension]] $n$ carries a canonical [[vector bundle]] of [[rank]] $n$: its [[tangent bundle]]. There is a [[universal vector bundle]] of rank $n$, of which all others arise by [[pullback]], up to [[isomorphism]]. The base space of this universal bundle is hence called the [[classifying space]] and denoted $B GL(n) \simeq B O(n)$ (for $O(n)$ the [[orthogonal group]]). This may be realized as the [[homotopy type]] of a [[direct limit]] of [[Grassmannian manifolds]]. In particular the tangent bundle of a manifold $X$ is classified by a map $X \longrightarrow B O(n)$, unique up to homotopy. For $G$ a [[subgroup]] of $O(n)$, then a lift of this map through the canonical map $B G \longrightarrow B O(n)$ of classifying spaces is a _[[G-structure]]_ on $X$

$$
  \array{
    && B G
    \\
    &\nearrow& \downarrow
    \\
    X &\longrightarrow& B O(n)
  }
$$ 

for instance an [[orientation]] for the inclusion $SO(n) \hookrightarrow O(n)$ of the [[special orthogonal group]], or an [[almost complex structure]] for the inclusion $U(n) \hookrightarrow O(2n)$ of the [[unitary group]].

All this generalizes, for instance from tangent bundles to [[normal bundles]] with respect to any [[embedding]]. It also behaves well with respect to passing to the [[boundary]] of manifolds, hence to [[bordism]]-classes of manifolds. This is what appears in [[Thom's theorem]] [below](#ThomTheorem).

**Literature.** ([Kochmann 96, 1.3-1.4](#Kochmann96))


#### Thom spectra
 {#ThomSpectra}
 
**Idea**. Given a [[vector bundle]] $V$ of rank $n$ over a [[compact topological space]], then its [[one-point compactification]] is equivalently the result of forming the bundle $D(V) \hookrightarrow V$ of unit [[n-balls]], and identifying with one single point all the boundary unit [[n-spheres]] $S(V)\hookrightarrow V$. Generally, this construction $Th(C) \coloneqq D(V)/S(V)$ is called the _[[Thom space]]_ of $V$. 

Thom spaces occur notably as codomains for would-be [[left inverses]] of [[embeddings]] of [[manifolds]] $X \hookrightarrow Y$. The _[[Pontrjagin-Thom collapse map]]_ $Y \to Th(N X)$ of such an embedding is a continuous function going the other way around, but landing not quite in $X$ but in the [[Thom space]] of the [[normal bundle]] of $X$ in $Y$. Composing this further with the classifying map of the [[normal bundle]] lands in the Thom space of the [[universal vector bundle]] over the [[classifying space]] $B O(k)$, denoted $M O(k)$. In particular in the case that $Y = S^n$ is an [[n-sphere]] (and every manifold embeds into a large enough $n$-sphere, see also at [[Whitney embedding theorem]]), the [[Pontryagin-Thom collapse map]] hence associates with every manifold an element of a [[homotopy group]] of a universal Thom space $M O(k)$.

This curious construction turns out to have excellent formal properties: as the dimension ranges, the universal Thom spaces arrange into a [[spectrum]], called the _[[Thom spectrum]]_, and the homotopy groups defined by the Pontryagin-Thom collapse pass along to the [[stable homotopy groups]] of this spectrum. 

Moreover, via [[Whitney sum]] of [[vector bundle]] the [[Thom spectrum]] naturally is a [[ring spectrum]], and under the Pontryagin-Thom collapse the [[Cartesian product]] of manifolds is compatible with this ring structure.

**Literature.** ([Kochmann 96, 1.5](#Kochmann96))


#### Thom's theorem
 {#ThomTheorem}

**Idea.** By the [[Pontryagin-Thom collapse]] construction [above](#ThomSpectra), there is an assignment

$$
  n Manifolds \longrightarrow \pi_n(M O)
$$

which sends [[disjoint union]] and [[Cartesian product]] of manifolds to sum and product in the [[ring]] of [[stable homotopy groups]] of the [[Thom spectrum]]. One finds then that two manifolds map to the same element in $\pi_\bullet(M O)$ precisely if they are connected by a [[bordism]] as [above](#ClassifyingSpaces). The [[bordism]]-classes $\Omega_\bullet^O$ of manifolds  form a [[commutative ring]] under [[disjoint union]] and [[Cartesian product]], called the _[[bordism ring]]_, and hence Pontrjagin-Thom collapse produces a ring [[homomorphism]]

$$
  \Omega_\bullet^O \longrightarrow \pi_\bullet(M O)
  \,.
$$

[[Thom's theorem]] states that this homomorphism is an [[isomorphism]].

**Literature.** ([Kochmann 96, 1.5](#Kochmann96))


#### Thom isomorphism
 {#ThomIsomorphism}


**Idea.** If a [[vector bundle]] $E \stackrel{p}{\longrightarrow} X$ of [[rank]] $n$ carries a cohomology class $\omega \in H^n(Th(E),R)$  that looks fiberwise like a [[volume form]] -- a [[Thom class]] -- then the operation of pulling back from base space and then forming the [[cup product]] with this [[Thom class]] is an [[isomorphism]] on (reduced) cohomology

$$
  ( (-) \cup \omega) \circ p^\ast 
  \;\colon\;
  H^\bullet(X,R) \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} \tilde H^{\bullet+n}(Th(E),R)
  \,.
$$

This is the _[[Thom isomorphism]]_. It follow from the [[Serre spectral sequence]] (or else from the [[Leray-Hirsch theorem]]).

We need this below to compute (co)homology of universal Thom spectra $M U$ in terms of that of the [[classifying spaces]] $B U$.

Composed with pullback along the [[Pontryagin-Thom collapse map]], the Thom isomorphism produces maps in cohomology that covariantly follow the underlying maps of spaces. These "[[Umkehr maps]]" have the interpretation of [[fiber integration]] against the Thom class.


**Literature.** ([Kochmann 96, 2.6](#Kochmann96))



#### Orientation in generalized cohomology
 {#OrientationAndFiberIntegration}


**Idea.** From the way the [[Thom isomorphism]] via a [[Thom class]] works in [[ordinary cohomology]] (as [above](#ThomIsomorphism)), one sees what the general concept of [[orientation in generalized cohomology]] and of [[fiber integration in generalized cohomology]] is to be.

An important application is given by taking $E = $ [[KU]] to be [[topological K-theory]]. Then [[orientation in generalized cohomology|orientation]] is [[spin structure]] and fiber integration with coefficients in $E$ is [[fiber integration in K-theory]]. This is classical _[[index theory]]_.

**Literature.** ([Kochmann 96, section 4.3](#Kochmann96), [Adams 74, part III, section 10](#Adams74), [Lurie 10, lecture 5](#Lurie10))


$\,$

### **Part S3) Complex oriented cohomology**
 {#ComplexOrientedCohomologyTheory}



**Idea.** Given the concept of [[orientation in generalized cohomology]] as [above](#OrientationAndFiberIntegration), it is clearly of interest to consider [[cohomology theories]] $E$ such that there exists an [[orientation in generalized cohomology|orientation]]/[[Thom class]] on the [[universal vector bundle]] over any [[classifying space]] $B G$ (or rather: on its induced [[spherical fibration]]), because then _all_ $G$-[[associated vector bundles]] inherit an orientation.

Considering this for $G = U(n)$ the [[unitary groups]] yields the concept of _[[complex oriented cohomology theory]]_. 

It turns out that a complex orientation on a generalized cohomology theory $E$ in this sense is already given by demanding that there is a suitable generalization of the [[first Chern class]] of [[complex line bundles]] in $E$-cohomology. By the [[splitting principle]], this already implies the existence of [[generalized Chern classes]] ([[Conner-Floyd Chern classes]]) of all degrees, and these are the required universal generalized [[Thom classes]].

Where the ordinary [[first Chern class]] in [[ordinary cohomology]] is simply additive under [[tensor product]] of [[complex line bundles]], one finds that the composite of generalized first Chern classes is instead governed by more general commutative [[formal group laws]]. This phenomenon governs much of the theory to follow.

**Literature.** ([Kochmann 96, section 4.3](#Kochmann96), [Lurie 10, lectures 1-10](#Lurie10), [Adams 74, Part I, Part II](#Adams74)).


#### Chern classes
 {#ChernClasses}

**Idea**. In particular [[ordinary cohomology]] [[HR]] is canonically a [[complex oriented cohomology theory]]. The behaviour of general [[Conner-Floyd Chern classes]] to be discussed [below](#ConnerFloydChernClasses) follows closely the behaviour of the ordinary [[Chern classes]]. 

An ordinary [[Chern class]] is a [[characteristic class]] of [[complex vector bundles]], and since there is the [[classifying space]] $B U$ of complex vector bundles, the _universal_ Chern classes are those of the [[universal complex vector bundle]] over the [[classifying space]] $B U$, which in turn are just the [[ordinary cohomology]] classes in $H^\bullet(B U)$

These may be computed inductively by iteratively applying to the [[spherical fibrations]]

$$
  S^{2n-1} \longrightarrow B U(n-1) \longrightarrow B U(n)
$$

the [[Thom-Gysin exact sequence]], a special case of the [[Serre spectral sequence]]. 

Pullback of Chern classes along the canonical map $(B U(1))^n \longrightarrow B U(n)$ identifies them with the [[symmetric polynomials]] in the [[first Chern class]] in $H^2(B U(1))$. This is the _[[splitting principle]]_.

**Literature.** ([Kochmann 96, section 2.3](#Kochmann96), [Lurie 10, lecture 5, prop. 6](#Lurie10))


#### Conner-Floyd Chern classes
 {#ConnerFloydChernClasses}

**Idea.** For $E$ a [[complex oriented cohomology theory]], then the generators of the $E$-[[cohomology groups]] of the [[classifying space]] $B U$ are called the _[[Conner-Floyd Chern classes]]_, in $E^\bullet(B U)$. 

Using basic properties of the classifying space $B U(1)$ via its incarnation as the infinite [[complex projective space]] $\mathbb{C}P^\infty$, one finds that the [[Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequences]]

$$
  H^p(\mathbb{C}P^n, \pi_q(E)) \Rightarrow H^\bullet(\mathbb{C}P^n)
$$

collapse right away, and that the [[inverse system]] which they form satisfies the [[Mittag-Leffler condition]]. Accordinly the [[Milnor exact sequence]] gives that the ordinary [[first Chern class]] $c_1$ generates,  over $\pi_\bullet(E)$, all Conner-Floyd classes over $B U(1)$:

$$
  E^\bullet(B U(1)) \simeq \pi_\bullet(E) [ [ c_1 ] ]
  \,.
$$

This is the key input for the discussion of [[formal group laws]] [below](#FormalGroupLaws).

Combining the [[Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence]] with the [[splitting principle]] as for ordinary Chern classes [above](#ChernClasses) yields, similarly, that in general Conner-Floyd classes are generated, over $\pi_\bullet(E)$, from the ordinary Chern classes.

Finally one checks that Conner-Floyd classes canonically serve as [[Thom classes]] for $E$-cohomology of the [[universal complex vector bundle]], therby showing that [[complex oriented cohomology theories]] are indeed canonically [[orientation in generalized cohomology|oriented]] on ([[spherical fibrations]] of) [[complex vector bundles]]. 
 
**Literature.** ([Kochmann 96, section 4.3](#Kochmann96) [Adams 74, part I.4, part II.2 II.4, part III.10](#Adams74), [Lurie 10, lecture 5](#Lurie10))


#### Formal group laws of first CF-Chern classes
 {#FormalGroupLaws}

**Idea.** The [[classifying space]] $B U(1)$ for [[complex line bundles]] is a [[homotopy type]] canonically equipped with commutative group structure ([[infinity-group]]-structure), corresponding to the [[tensor product]] of complex line bundles. By the above, the [[first Chern class]] of these complex line bundles generates the $E$-cohomology of $B U(1)$, it follows that the [[cohomology ring]] $E^\bullet(B U(1)) \simeq \pi_\bullet(E)[ [ c_1 ] ]$ behaves like the ring of $\pi_\bullet(E)$-valued functions on a 1-dimensional commutative [[formal group]] equipped with a canonical [[coordinate]] function $c_1$. This is called a _[[formal group law]]_ over the [[graded ring]] $\pi_\bullet(E)$. 

On abstract grounds it follows that there exists a commutative ring $L$ and a universal (1-dimensional commutative) formal group law $\ell$ over $L$. This is called the _[[Lazard ring]]_. [[Lazard's theorem]] identifies this ring concretely: it turns out to simply be the [[polynomial ring]] on generators in every even degree.

Further below this has profound implications on the structure theory for complex oriented cohomology. The [[Milnor-Quillen theorem on MU]] identifies the Lazard ring as the cohomology ring of the [[Thom spectrum]] [[MU]], and then the [[Landweber exact functor theorem]], implies that there are lots of complex oriented cohomology theories.

**Literature.** ([Kochmann 96, section 4.4](#Kochmann96), [Lurie 10, lectures 1 and 2](#Lurie10))


#### Complex cobordism
 {#ComplexCobordismCohomology}

**Idea.** There is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]] $\phi \colon B U(1)\stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} M U(1)$ between the [[classifying space]] for [[complex line bundles]] and the  [[Thom space]] of the [[universal vector bundle|universal complex line bundle]]. This gives an element $\pi_\ast(c_1) \in M U^2(B U(1))$ in the [[complex cobordism cohomology]] of $B U(1)$ which makes the universal complex [[Thom spectrum]] [[MU]] become a [[complex oriented cohomology theory]].

This turns out to be a [[universal complex orientation on MU]]: for every other [[ring spectrum]] $E$ there is an equivalence between complex orientations on $E$ and ring spectrum homomorphisms

$$
  \{M U \longrightarrow E\} \;\simeq\; \{complex\;orientations\;on\;E\}
  \,.
$$

Hence [[complex oriented cohomology theory]] is just [[higher algebra]] over [[MU]]. Equivalently: affine [[spectral geometry]] over $Spec(MU)$.

**Literature.** ([Kochmann 96, section 1.4, 1.5, 4.4](#Kochmann96),[Lurie 10, lectures 5 and 6](#Lurie10))


#### Homology of $M U$
 {#HomologyOfMU}

**Idea.** Since, by the above, every [[complex oriented cohomology theory]] $E$ is indeed [[orientation in generalized cohomology|oriented]] over [[complex vector bundles]], there is a [[Thom isomorphism]] which reduces the computation of the $E$-[[homology of MU]], $E_\bullet(M U)$ to that of the [[classifying space]] $B U$. The [[Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence]] allows to compute this. Via the [[Hurewicz homomorphism]]/[[Boardman homomorphism]] this gives a first approximation to the [[homotopy groups]] of [[MU]].

**Literature.** ([Kochmann 96, section 2.4, 4.3](#Kochmann96), [Lurie 10, lecture 7](#Lurie10))


#### Quillen's theorem on $M U$
 {#QuillenTheoremOnMU}

**Idea.** From the computation of the [[homology of MU]] [above](#HomologyOfMU) and applying the [[Boardman homomorphism]], one deduces that the [[stable homotopy groups]] $\pi_\bullet(MU)$ of [[MU]] are finitely generated. This implies that it is suffient to compute them over the [[p-adic integers]] for all primes $p$. Using the [[change of rings theorem]], this finally is obtained from inspection of the filtration in the $H\mathbb{F}_p$-[[Adams spectral sequence]] for $MU$. This is Milnor's theorem wich together with [[Lazard's theorem]] shows that there is an isomorphism of rings $L \simeq \pi_\bullet(M U)$ with the [[Lazard ring]]. Finally [[Quillen's theorem on MU]] says that this isomorphism is exhibited by the universal ring homomorphism $L \longrightarrow \pi_\bullet(M U)$ which classifies the universal complex orientation on $M U$.

**Literature.** ([Kochmann 96, section 4.4](#Kochmann96), [Lurie, lecture 10](#Lurie10))


#### Landweber exact functor theorem

**Idea.** By the above, every [[complex oriented cohomology theory]] induces a [[formal group law]] from its first [[Conner-Floyd Chern class]]. Moreover, [[Quillen's theorem on MU]] together with [[Lazard's theorem]] say that the [[cohomology ring]] $\pi_\bullet(M U)$ of [[complex cobordism cohomology]] [[MU]] is the classifying ring for formal group laws. 

The _[[Landweber exact functor theorem]]_ says that, conversely, forming the [[tensor product]] of [[complex cobordism cohomology theory]] ([[MU]]) with a [[Landweber exactness|Landweber exact]] [[ring]] via some [[formal group law]] yields a [[cohomology theory]], hence a [[complex oriented cohomology theory]]. 

**Literature.** ([Lurie 10, lectures 15,16](#Lurie10))

### Outlook: Geometry of $Spec(MU)$

The grand conclusion of [[Quillen's theorem on MU]] ([above](#QuillenTheoremOnMU)): [[complex oriented cohomology theory]] is essentially the [[spectral geometry]] over $Spec(M U)$, and the latter is a kind of derived version of the [[moduli stack of formal groups]] (1-dimensional commutative).
