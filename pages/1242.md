## Definition

### General

An **exact sequence** is a [[chain complex]] with vanishing [[chain homology]].

### Long and short exact sequences

A general exact sequence is sometimes called a **long exact sequence**, to distinguish from the special case of a **short exact sequence** which is an exact sequence of the form
$$ 0 \to A \to B \to C \to 0 .$$
Of course, by adding $0$ to either end (or both!), one turns a short exact sequence into a chain complex and in particular into a long exact sequence.

A short exact sequence may also be defined in more elementary terms as a sequence
$$ A \stackrel{i}\to B \stackrel{p}\to C $$
such that $i$ is a [[monomorphism]], $p$ is an [[epimorphism]], and the [[image]] of $i$ equals the [[kernel]] of $p$ (equivalently, the [[coimage]] of $p$ equals the [[cokernel]] of $i$).

A **split exact sequence** is a short exact sequence in which $i$ is a [[split monomorphism]], or (equivalently) in which $p$ is a [[split epimorphism]].  In this case, $B$ may be decomposed as the [[biproduct]] $A \oplus C$ (with $i$ and $p$ the usual biproduct inclusion and projection); this sense in which $B$ is 'split' into $A$ and $C$ is the origin of the general terms 'split (mono/epi)morphism'.

The above works in any [[abelian category]], and possible more generally.  See also [[exact sequence of Hopf algebras]].

## Properties

### Exactness and quasi-isomorphisms

A chain complex $C_\bullet$ is exact (is a long exact sequence), precisely if the unique [[chain map]] from the [[initial object]], the 0-complex

  $$
    0 \to C_\bullet
  $$

  is a [[quasi-isomorphism]].

### Short exact sequences and quotients
 {#SESAndQuotients}

The following are some basic lemmas that show how given a short exact sequence one obtains new short exact sequences from forming [[quotients]]/[[cokernels]] (see [Wise](#Wise)). 

Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an [[abelian category]].

###### Lemma

For

$$
  A \to B \to C \to 0
$$

an exact sequence in $\mathcal{A}$ and for $X \to B$ any morphism in $\mathcal{A}$, also

$$
  A \to B/X \to C/X \to 0
$$

is a short exaxt sequence.

###### Proof

We have an exact sequence of complexes of lenght 2

$$
  \array{
    0 &\to& X &\stackrel{id}{\to}& X &\to& 0
    \\
    \downarrow & & \downarrow & & \downarrow & & \downarrow
    \\
    A &\to& B &\to& C &\to& 0
  }
$$

and the exact sequence to be demonstrated is degreewise the [[cokernel]] of this sequence. So the statement reduces to the fact that forming cokernels is a [[right exact functor]].

###### Lemma

For

$$
  0 \to A \to B \to C
$$

an exact sequence and $X \to A$ any morphism, also 

$$
  0 \to A/X \to B/X  \to C
$$

is exact.
