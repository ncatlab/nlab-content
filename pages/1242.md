## Definition


Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an [[additive category]] (often assumed to be an [[abelian category]]).

+-- {: .num_defn #ExactSequence}
###### Definition

An **exact sequence** in $\mathcal{A}$ is a [[chain complex]] $C_\bullet$ in $\mathcal{A}$ with vanishing [[chain homology]] in each degree:

$$
  \forall n \in \mathbb{N} . H_n(C) = 0 
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #ShortExactSequence}
###### Definition

A **short exact sequence** is an exact sequence, def. \ref{ExactSequence} of the form

$$
  \cdots \to 0 \to 0 \to A \to B \to C \to 0 \to 0 \to \cdots
  \,.
$$

One usually writes this just "$0 \to A \to B \to C \to 0$" or even just "$A \to B \to C$".

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark

A general exact sequence is sometimes called a **long exact sequence**, to distinguish from the special case of a short exact sequence.

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

Explicitly, a sequence of morphisms 

$$ 
  A \stackrel{i}\to B \stackrel{p}\to C 
$$

is short exact, def. \ref{ShortExactSequence}, precisely if

1. $i$ is a [[monomorphism]],

1. $p$ is an [[epimorphism]], 

1. and the [[image]] of $i$ equals the [[kernel]] of $p$  (equivalently, the [[coimage]] of $p$ equals the [[cokernel]] of $i$).

=--

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

A **[[split exact sequence]]** is a short exact sequence as above in which $i$ is a [[split monomorphism]], or (equivalently) in which $p$ is a [[split epimorphism]].  

=--

In this case, $B$ may be decomposed as the [[biproduct]] $A \oplus C$ (with $i$ and $p$ the usual biproduct inclusion and projection); this sense in which $B$ is 'split' into $A$ and $C$ is the origin of the general terms 'split (mono/epi)morphism'.

## Properties

### Exactness and quasi-isomorphisms
 {#ExactnessAndQuasiIsomorphisms}

+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

A chain complex $C_\bullet$ is exact (is a long exact sequence), precisely if the unique [[chain map]] from the [[initial object]], the 0-complex

  $$
    0 \to C_\bullet
  $$

is a [[quasi-isomorphism]].

### Short exact sequences and quotients
 {#SESAndQuotients}

The following are some basic lemmas that show how given a short exact sequence one obtains new short exact sequences from forming [[quotients]]/[[cokernels]] (see [Wise](#Wise)). 

Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an [[abelian category]]. 

+-- {: .num_lemma}
###### Lemma

For

$$
  A \to B \to C \to 0
$$

an exact sequence in $\mathcal{A}$ and for $X \to B$ any morphism in $\mathcal{A}$, also

$$
  A \to B/X \to C/X \to 0
$$

is a short exaxt sequence.


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We have an exact sequence of complexes of lenght 2

$$
  \array{
    0 &\to& X &\stackrel{id}{\to}& X &\to& 0
    \\
    \downarrow & & \downarrow & & \downarrow & & \downarrow
    \\
    A &\to& B &\to& C &\to& 0
  }
$$

and the exact sequence to be demonstrated is degreewise the [[cokernel]] of this sequence. So the statement reduces to the fact that forming cokernels is a [[right exact functor]].

###### Lemma

For

$$
  0 \to A \to B \to C
$$

an exact sequence and $X \to A$ any morphism, also 

$$
  0 \to A/X \to B/X  \to C
$$

is exact.
