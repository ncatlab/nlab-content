A continuous linear operator $F:B_1\to B_2$ between [[Banach spaces]] is **Fredholm** if it has finite dimensional [[kernel]] and finite dimensional [[cokernel]]. It follows that its image (range) is closed. The difference between the dimensions of the kernel and the cokernel is called the **index** of the Fredholm operator

$$
ind F = dim ker F - dim coker F = dim ker F - codim im F
$$

A characterization: a bounded linear operator $F:B_1\to B_2$ between Banach spaces is Fredholm iff it there is an operator $T:B_2\to B_1$ which is its inverse up to a [[compact operator]], i.e. $FT - Id_{B_2}$ and $TF-Id_{B_1}$ are compact operators. 

Elliptic operators on compact manifolds are naturally Fredholm, when understood between the appropriate [[Sobolev spaces]].
