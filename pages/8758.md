#### Aren't categories just transitive digraphs? 
One sometimes gets reactions like "aren't categories just transitive digraphs?": this is not correct, a category is much more than such a graph (and also more than any reasonable decoration of such a graph): while indeed the underlying quiver of any category is a transitive directed (pseudo)-graph, a category itself carries more structure, namely the  "generalized multiplication table" in the background, giving the compositions of the morphisms. The [[forgetful functor]] $\mathsf{CAT}\rightarrow\mathsf{Quiv}$ actually does forget quite a lot.
