## Idea 

The **Kalb-Ramond field** or **B-field** is the [[gauge field]] that generalizes the [[electromagnetic field]] from point particles to [[string theory|strings]].

Recall that the [[electromagnetic field]] is modeled as a [[cocycle]] in degree 2 [[ordinary differential cohomology]] and that this mathematical model is fixed by the fact that charged particles that trace out 1-dimensional trajectories couple to the electromagnetic field by an [[action functional]] that sends each trajectory to the holonomy of a $U(1)$-[[connection on a bundle|connection]] on it.

When replacing particles with 1-dimensional trajectories by [[string theory|strings]] with 2-dimensional trajectories, one accordingly expects that they may couple to a higher degree background field given by a degree 3 [[ordinary differential cohomology]] cocycle.

In [[string theory]] this situation arises and the corresponding background field appears, where it is called the _Kalb-Ramond field_  .

Often it is also simply called the **$B$-field** , after the standard symbol used for the 2-forms $(B_i \in \Omega^2(U_i))$ on patches $U_i$ of a [[cover]] of spacetime when the differential cocycle is expressed in a [[Cech cohomology]] realization of [[Deligne cohomology]].


This is the analog of the local 1-forms $(A_i \in \Omega^1(U_i))$ in a Cech cocycle presentation of a [[line bundle]] with [[connection on a bundle|connection]] encoding the [[electromagnetic field]].

The [[field strength]] of the Kalb-Ramond field is a [[differential forms|3-form]] $H \in \Omega$. On each patch $U_i$ it is given by

$$
  H|_{U_i} = d B_i
  \,.
$$


And just as a degree 2 [[Deligne cohomology|Deligne cocycle]] is equivalently encoded in a $U(1)$-[[principal bundle]] [[connection on a bundle|with connection]], the degree 3 differential cocycle is equivalently encoded in

* a degree 3 [[Deligne cohomology|Deligne cocycle]];

* a $\mathbf{B}U(1)$-[[principal 2-bundle]] with connection;

* a $U(1)$-[[bundle gerbe]] with connection. 

The study of [[bundle gerbe]]s was largely motivated and driven by the desire to understand the Kalb-Ramond field.

The next higher degree analog of the electromagnetic field is the [[supergravity C-field]].

## Mathematical model from (formal) physical input 

The derivation of the fact that the Kalb-Ramond field that is locally given by a 2-form is globally really a degree 3 cocycle in the [[Deligne cohomology]] model for [[ordinary differential cohomology]] proceeds in in entire analogy with the corresponding discussion of the [[electromagnetic field]]:

* **classical background** The [[field strength]] 3-form $H \in \Omega^3(X)$ is required to be closed, $d H_3 = 0$.

* **quantum coupling** The gauge interaction with the quantum string is required to yield a well-defined surface holomomy in $U(1)$ from locally integrating the 2-forms $B_i \in \Omega^2(U_2)$ with $d B_i = H|_{U_i}$ over its 2-dimensional trajectory.


  $$
    hol(\Sigma)
    =
    \prod_{f} \exp(i \int_f \Sigma^* B_{\rho(f)})
    \prod_{e \subset f}
    \exp(i \int_{e} \Sigma^* A_{\rho(f) \rho(e)})
    \prod_{v \subset e \subset f}
    \exp(i \lambda_{\rho(f) \rho(e) \rho(v)})
    \,.
  $$

  That this is well defined requires that

  $$
    \lambda_{i j k} - \lambda_{i j l} +
    \lambda_{i k l} - \lambda_{j k l}
    = 0 \;mod \, 2\pi
  $$

  which says that $(B_i, A_{i j}, \lambda_{i j k})$ is indeed a degree 3 [[Deligne cohomology|Deligne cocycle]].

## Over D-branes

The restriction of the Kalb-Ramond field in the 10-dimensional [[spacetime]] to a [[D-brane]] is a twist (as in [[twisted cohomology]]) of the [[gauge field]] on the D-brane: its 3-class is [[magnetic charge]] for the [[electromagnetic field]]/[[Yang-Mills field]] on the D-brane. See also [[Freed-Witten anomaly cancellation]] or the discussion in ([Moore](#Moore)).

The earliest reference where the gauge term in the standard string [[action functional]] is identified with the surface holonomy of a 3-cocycle in [[Deligne cohomology]] seems to be

In fact, in full generality the Kalb-Ramond field on an [[orientifold]] background is not a plain gerbe, but a _Jandl gerbe_ , a connection on a nonabelian $AUT(U(1))$-[[principal 2-bundle]]s for the [[automorphism 2-group]] $AUT(U)(1))$ of $U(1)$:
