## Definition

A _symmetric monoidal (weak) 2-category_ is a [[monoidal 2-category]] with a categorified version of a [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetry]].

That is, it is a [[2-category]] $C$ equipped with a [[tensor product]] $\otimes : C \times C \to C$ [[2-functor]] which satisfies all possible conditions for being commutative up to equivalence.  In the language of [[k-tuply monoidal n-category|k-tuply monoidal n-categories]], a braided monoidal 2-category is a *quadruply monoidal 2-category*.  As described there, this may be identified with a pointed 6-category with a single $k$-morphism for $k=0,1,2,3$.  We can also say that it is a monoidal 2-category whose [[En-algebra|E1-algebra]] structure is refined to an [[En-algebra|E4-algebra]] structure.

## Examples

* A symmetric monoidal 2-category all whose objects are invertible under the tensor product is a [[symmetric 3-group]].
