## Idea

Epsilontic analysis is the now standard rigorous approach to [[analysis]], developed by [[Augustin Cauchy]], [[Karl Weierstrass|Karl Weierstraß]], [[Richard Dedekind]], and others in the mid-to-late 19th century.  It contrasts with [[infinitesimal analysis]], both the less-than-rigorous analysis that preceded it and the rigorous [[nonstandard analysis]] (and other approaches to infinitesimals, such as [[synthetic differential geometry]]) that followed it.

Ironically, classical epsilontic analysis is not rigorous enough for some [[constructive mathematics|constructive mathematicians]], such as [[Jan Brouwer]], who would allow it to be applied only using [[intuitionistic logic]].  This was developed thoroughly by [[Errett Bishop]].


## History

Epsilontic analysis developed out of the practical problems of finding errors of [[approximation]].  Taking the basic principles of calculus for granted, 18th-century mathematicians discovered various methods to approximate the values of limits, derivatives, integrals, and series with an error guaranteed to be bounded above by whatever [[positive number]] $\epsilon$ (for 'error') one wished.

Epsilontic analysis turns these results around into definitions: the value of a limit, derivative, integral, or series is *defined* to be the (necessarily unique) [[real number]] $L$ such that, given any positive number $\epsilon$, one can produce an approximation within $\epsilon$ of $L$.

The first person to use such definitions systematically in proofs seems to have been [[Augustin Cauchy]], in his 1821 _[[Cours d'Analyse]]_.  However, Cauchy also used [[infinitesimal number|infinitesimals]], and he did not define everything with epsilontics.  This was left to [[Karl Weiestrass|Karl Weierstraß]].


## Topological vs uniform properties

The precise post-Cauchy development of epsilontics was necessary to clarify the difference between (as we now see them) [[topological property|topological]] and [[uniform property|uniform properties]], which show up in the order of [[quantifiers]] in the definitions.

Typically, topological properties apply at a point, although one can then require them at all points.  Doing so, one has a definition of the form
$$ \forall x,\; \forall \epsilon,\; \exists M,\; \phi(M,x,\epsilon) ,$$
where $M$ is some parameter for a method of approximation and $\phi(\epsilon,M,x)$ states that the method, applied with the parameter $M$, approximates a value of interest at $x$ to within an error $\epsilon$.  Equivalently, one may write
$$ \forall \epsilon,\; \forall x,\; \exists M,\; \phi(M,x,\epsilon) ,$$
but we cannot shift the quantifiers further.

In contrast, a uniform property necessarily refers to a range of points and typically takes the form
$$ \forall \epsilon,\; \exists M,\; \forall x,\; \phi(M,x,\epsilon) ,$$
which is stronger.
