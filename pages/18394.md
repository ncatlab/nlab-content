## Idea

Formally, a cotopology of a topological space $X$ is a coarser topological space $^*X$ on the same set $X$ that does not forget too many sets.
Some topologically concepts, like complete metrizability, can be formulated in terms of cotopology.
The approach was introduced by Johannes de Groot.
He argued that cocompact spaces are a better generalization of the completeness property of metric spaces than uniform structures.

###### Definition
Let $X$ be a topological space and set $\mathcal{O} = Op(X)$.
A topology $^*\mathcal{O}$ on $X$ is called a **cotopology** of $\mathcal{O}$--and $^*X = (X, ^*\mathcal{O})$ is called a **cospace** of $X$ if

1. $^*\mathcal{O}$ is coarser than $\mathcal{O}$, i.e., $^*\mathcal{O} \subseteq \mathcal{O}$; 
1. for each point $x$ and each closed neighborhood $V$ of $x$ in $X$ there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $x$ in $X$ such that $U$ is contained in $V$ and $U$ is closed in $^*X$.

For regular spaces the last condition can be replaced by

* Each point $x$ has a neighborhood base in $X$ the elements of which are closed in $^*X$.

###### Definition
A topological space $X$ is called **cocompact** if there is a cospace $^*X$ of $X$ which is compact.

## Properties

A metrizable space is [[topologically complete space|topologically complete]] if and only if it is cocompact.
