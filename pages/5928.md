## Idea

The _Zariski topology_ is a [[coverage]] on the [[opposite category]] [[CRing]]${}^{op}$ of commutative rings.

## Definition

For $R$ a commutative [[ring]], write $Spec R \in CRing^{op}$ for its incarnation in the [[opposite category]].

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

A family of morphisms $\{Spec A_i \to Spec R\}$ in $CRing^{op}$ is a Zariski-[[covering]] precisely if 

* each ring $A_i$ is the [[localization]]

  $$
    A_i = R[r_i^{-1}]
  $$

  of $R$ at a single element $r_i \in R$ 

* $Spec A_i \to Spec R$ is the canonical inclusion, dual to the canonical ring homomorphism $R \to R[r_i^{-1}]$;

* There exists $\{f_i \in R\}$ such that

  $$
    \sum_i f_i r_i = 1
    \,.
  $$

###### Remark

Geometrically, one may think of

* $r_i$ as a function on the [[space]] $Spec R$;

* $R[r_i^{-1}]$ as the [[open subset]] of points in this space on which the function is not 0;

* the covering condition as saying that the functions form a [[partition of unity]] on $Spec R$.

###### Definition

Let $CRing_{fp} \hookrightarrow CRing$ be the [[full subcategory]] on [[finitely presented object]]s. This inherity the Zariski [[coverage]].

The [[sheaf topos]] over this [[site]] is the [[big topos]] version of the  **Zariski topos**.

###### Proposition

The Zariski coverage is [[subcanonical coverage|subcanoncial]].

###### Proposition


* $CRing_{fp}^{op}$ is the [[syntactic category]] of the [[cartesian theory]] of commutative rings;

* $CRing_{fp}^{op}$ equipped with the Zariski topology is the [[syntactic site]] of the [[geometric theory]] of [[local ring]]s.

Hence 

* the big Zariski topos, def. \ref{ZariskiTopos}, is the [[classifying topos]] for [[local ring]]s.

* a [[locally ringed topos]] is equivalently a topos $\mathcal{E}$ equipped with a [[geometric morphism]] into the big Zariski topos.
