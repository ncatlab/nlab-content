## Idea

A _Jordan-Lie-Banach algebra_ (or _JLB-algebra_ for short) is a [[topology|topological]] [[algebra]] that behaves like a [[Poisson algebra]], only that the commutative product is not required to form an [[associative algebra]], but just a [[Jordan algebra]]. Hence a _JLB-algebra_ is a _nonassociative Poisson algebra_ with topology.

JLB-algebras are the outcome of [[quantization]] of [[Poisson algebra]]s. Often that outcome is regarded to be a non-commutative but associative [[C-star algebra]]. But any such induces a JLB-algebra by letting the Jordan product be the symmetrized product and the Lie bracket the [[commutator]]. There is a condition relating the [[associator]] of the JLB-algebra to the Lie bracket, that characterizes those JLB-algebras that come from non-commutative associative algebras, and in the usual definition of JLB-algebra this condition is required. In that case JLB-algebras are effectively the same as $C^*$-algebras, the only difference being that the single assocative product is explcitly regarded as inducing the two products of a non-associative Poisson algebra.
