#Idea and definition#

Classically, a **Schur functor** is a specific sort of [[functor]] 

$$F: FinVect_{\mathbb{C}} \to FinVect_{\mathbb{C}}$$ 

on the category of finite-dimensional complex [[vector space|vector spaces]].  Namely, it is a functor of this sort that is algebraic on homsets: the homsets are vector spaces, so one can demand that for any pair of objects $V, W \in FinVect_{\mathbb{C}}$ the functor

$$ F: hom(V,W) \to hom(F V , F W) $$

is a polynomial function from the vector space 
$hom(V,W)$ to the vector space $hom(F V , F W)$

In more modern treatments, a Schur functor is a functor defined (in a [[polymorphism|polymorphic]] way) on [[module|modules]] over more general [[commutative ring]] $R$ (possibly with some conditions on $R$), so that "Schur functor" really connotes a family of functors 

$$F_R: Mod_R \to Mod_R$$ 

It turns out that much of the theory of Schur functors can be generalized even further, beyond module categories.  In this article, Todd Trimble and John Baez plan to explore the scope of such generality and --- we hope --- write a paper about what we find.

# Examples #

The first thing that should be understood from the beginning is that a general Schur functor $F$ is _nonlinear_: the action on [[hom-set]]s 

$$hom(V, W) \to hom(F(V), F(W))$$ 

is not assumed to respect linear structure. In fact, linear Schur functors are rather uninteresting: because every finite-dimensional space is a finite [[biproduct]] of the $1$-dimensional space $\mathbb{C}$, and because [[linear functor]]s preserve finite biproducts, it turns out that every linear Schur functor $F$ is [[representable functor|representable]] as $hom(X, -)$ where $X = F(\mathbb{C})$. The category of linear Schur functors is equivalent to $Vect_{fd}$. 

Rather more representative examples of Schur functors include: 

* For each $k \geq 0$, the $k^{th}$ [[tensor power]] $V \mapsto V^{\otimes k}$ is a Schur functor. 

* For each $k \geq 0$, the $k^{th}$ [[symmetric power]] $V \mapsto Sym^k(V)$ is a Schur functor. 

* For each $k \geq 0$, the $k^{th}$ [[alternating power]] $V \mapsto Alt^k(V)$ is a Schur functor. 

Even though Schur functors do not respect linear structure, the category $Schur$ of Schur functors is nevertheless a [[linear category]], so we can talk about [[irreducible object]]s, decompositions into [[direct sum|direct sums]], and so on. It turns out that every Schur functor $F$ can be expressed as a direct sum of irreducible $Schur$-objects $S_\lambda$ indexed by [[Young diagram]]s $\lambda$, and these $S_\lambda$ are usually what people think of when they say "Schur functors".

[[Todd Trimble]]: I took this statement about decompositions from the blog discussion, but what's the precise statement? I have a hard time believing that it's a finite decomposition in general. I'm hoping the situation is analogous to analytic functors in the case of species, but I'm not at all sure what the precise statement should be. 

Even if it is something analogous to analytic functors, I am reminded that analytic functors on $Set$ aren't just any old functors; they are characterized by certain properties such as weak preservation of pullbacks. Is there something similar that needs to be said for the very general sense of 'Schur functor' given above?

[[John Baez]]: I think we don't need anything more than what we're assuming above.  But let's prove that.

# Schur functors associated with Young diagrams #

Functors such as the $k^{th}$ alternating power, $k^{th}$ symmetric power, etc. make sense in much wider contexts than just $Vect_{\mathbb{C}}$. Indeed, let $C$ be any [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal]] [[abelian category]] whose hom-objects are $\mathbb{Q}$-vector spaces.

[[Todd Trimble]]: 
I wimped out and chose rational vector spaces as the base of enrichment. For one thing, the blog commentary seems to suggest that there are delicate issues in nonzero characteristic. Even in cases where there is no integer torsion, it seems to me that integer divisibility makes certain things come out a lot more cleanly, and (if I am not mistaken) means that certain finite cocompleteness conditions can be relaxed in favor of Cauchy completeness (in the enriched category sense of Lawvere). More on this later. 

[[John Baez]]: You're right that there are special tricky endofunctors 
$$ F: FinVect_{\mathbb{C}} \to FinVect_{k} $$
that can be defined only when $k$ has characteristic $p$.
So, using categories enriched over $Vect_k$ with $k$ having characteristic zero is probably a wise idea, at least for starters.  But I'm really hoping that we can drop that in the more sophisticated approach where we work with all symmetric monoidal abelian categories simultaneously and demand pseudonaturality.  I'm hoping this will 'wash out' the tricky functors that only work in characteristic $p$, leaving us with just the Schur functors we know and love.

Recall that the [[group algebra]] $\mathbb{Q}[S_n]$ decomposes as a direct sum 

$$\sum_{\lambda} V_{\lambda}$$ 

where $\lambda$ ranges over isomorphism classes of [[partition]]s of a set of size $n$, also known as [[Young diagram]]s, and $V_\lambda$ represents the isomorphism class of irreducible $S_n$-representations attached to $\lambda$.  

This group algebra lives as a [[monoid]] in the symmetric monoidal category of finite-dimensional rational spaces $Vect_{fd}$. If $Sk$ is the skeleton of $Vect_{fd}$ consisting of the finite coproducts $\mathbb{Q}^n$, then there is an evident linear functor 

$$Sk \to C: \mathbb{Q}^n \mapsto I^n$$ 

where $I^n$ is the $n$-fold coproduct of the monoidal unit $I$ of $C$. By left Kan extension along the inclusion $Sk \hookrightarrow Vect_{fd}$, we therefore obtain a canonical [[change of base]] functor 

$$i: Vect_{fd} \to C$$ 

which is in fact [[symmetric monoidal functor|symmetric monoidal]]. This means the change of base maps the group algebra $\mathbb{Q}[S_n]$ to a monoid in $C$, again denoted $\mathbb{Q}[S_n]$ by abuse of notation, and it maps each of the irreducible representations $V_\lambda$ to a corresponding module over the monoid $\mathbb{Q}[S_n]$ in $C$, which we again denote by $V_\lambda$. 

If $X$ is an object of $C$, the symmetric group [[action]] 

$$S_n \to hom(X^{\otimes n}, X^{\otimes n})$$ 

in $Set$ induces an action 

$$\mathbb{Q}[S_n] \otimes X^{\otimes n} \to X^{\otimes n}$$ 

in $C$. Thus $\mathbb{Q}[S_n]$ acts diagonally on the object 

$$V_\lambda \otimes X^{\otimes n}$$ 

and we define $S_\lambda(X)$ to be the object of $S_n$-invariants of $V_{\lambda} \otimes X^{\otimes n}$, or equivalently as the image 

$$(\sum_{g \in S_n} g)(V_\lambda \otimes X^{\otimes n})$$ 

where the operator $\sum g$ is a scalar multiple of a projection operator. 

This construction of $S_\lambda(X)$ defines the **Schur functor** $S_\lambda$ on $C$. 

+--{.query} 
With the possible exception of the left Kan extension alluded to above, all these constructions may be carried out if we weaken the abelian assumption on $C$ to mere Cauchy completeness (relative to enrichment in rational vector spaces), which more concretely means that $C$ admits finite coproducts and splittings of idempotent projections. This observation was made by Noah Snyder on the blog. 

It would actually feel more natural to me to speak of the object of coinvariants rather than the object of invariants, but in the present context it should come to the same thing as either is the splitting of the idempotent operator $\frac1{n!}\sum g$. That is to say: there is a natural splitting of the idempotent natural transformation 
$$e_X = \frac1{n!} \sum_{g \in S_n} g: V_\lambda \otimes X^{\otimes n} \to V_\lambda \otimes X^{\otimes n}$$ 
which can be viewed either as invariants (equalizer of $e$ and the identity) or coinvariants (coequalizer of $e$ and the identity). 

[[John Baez]]: we need to use coinvariants when we get to  the more sophisticated approach where our constructions are supposed to preserved by <i>right exact</i> functors.  Also, coinvariants work even in characteristic $p$, while invariants involve dividing by $n!$.  So, coinvariants rule.

# Schur functors as actions of the plethystic monoidal category

There's a Schur functor from a symmetric monoidal category to itself for every $\mathbb{Z}[S_n]$ module $M$, given by 
$$S_M(X)=X^{\otimes n}\otimes_{\Z[S_n]}M.$$

The composition of these functors corresponds to a strange monoidal structure on $\oplus_n\mathbb{Z}[S_n]$-mod, given by plethysm:
$$M\boxtimes N=\mathrm{Ind}_{S_n\wr S_m}^{S_{mn}} M\wr N.$$

The Schur functors described above are those corresponding to irreducible modules over $\mathbb{Q}$. 

_Todd_: To be related to composition of analytic functors a la Joyal species... We also have material on plethysm, Tall-Wraith monoid, etc. to be linked to. 

# (Tentative) High-level description of Schur functors #

As we have just seen, Schur functors such as the $S_\lambda$ makes sense in pretty wide contexts, and the formula for the $S_\lambda$ is in some sense "polymorphic". The question arises as to the right way to give sense to such [[polymorphism]], or in other words the compatibility between these Schur functors across the various structured categories where they are defined. Here is a very general expression of that compatibility proposed by [[John Baez]]. 

The general idea is that Schur functors such as the $S_\lambda$ defined above on individual categories commute with suitable change-of-base functors between these categories. This commutation expresses a kind of naturality, for which we would like a clean and high-level description. 

_To be continued... I have some questions that I'll put to patrons of the Cafe._
