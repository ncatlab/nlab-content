## Idea

The _unitalization of a  non-unital [[algebra]] is a unital algebra with a unit [[free construction|freely]] adjoined.


## Definition

### For (non)associative algebras

For $R$ a [[commutative ring]] write $R Alg_{\mathrm{u}}$ for the [[category]] of [[nonassociative algebra]]s with unit over $R$ and unit-preserving [[homomorphisms]], and write $R Alg_{\mathrm{nu}}$ for nonunital nonassociative $R$-algebras.  Note that $R Alg_{\mathrm{u}}$ is a [[subcategory]] of $R Alg_{\mathrm{nu}}$, as we use both 'non-unital' and 'non-associative' in accordance with the [[red herring principle]].

The [[inclusion functor]] $U\colon R Alg{\mathrm{u}} \to R Alg_{\mathrm{nu}}$ has a [[left adjoint]] $(-)^+\colon R Alg_{\mathrmn{u}} \to R Alg{\mathrm{u}}$. For $A \in R Alg_{\mathrm{nu}}$ we say $A^+$ is the **unitalization** of $A$.

Explicitly, $A^+ = A \oplus R$ as an $R$-[[module]], with product given by
$$ (a_1, 0) (a_2, 0) = (a_1 a_2, 0) ,$$
$$ (0, r_1) (0, r_2) = (0, r_1 r_2) ,$$
$$ (a,0) (0,r) = (0,r) (a,0) = (r a, 0) ,$$
or in general
$$ (a_1, r_1) (a_2, r_2) = (a_1 a_2 + r_2 a_1 + r_1 a_2, r_1 r_2) .$$
We often write $(a, r)$ as $a + r$ or $a \oplus r$, which makes the above formulas obvious.

If $A$ is an [[associative algebra]], then $A^+$ will also be associative; if $A$ is a [[commutative algebra]], then $A^+$ will also be commutative.
