## Idea
A surreal space is essentially the space of [[surreal numbers]]. The arithmetic properties of the surreals of course follow suit in this space. We denote the surreal space as ${S}^n$

Surreal space (denoted as ${S}^n$) can be seen as a topologically enriched category of a real space ${R}^n$. We write ${Sur}$ to denote it. Its objects are all the infinitely near points of ${R}^n$, and all vector spaces over ordered fields. In fact, ${Sur}$ is a vector space over the reals. It is an equivalence relation acting on the reals and forms enriched modules over them. Given the concept of a topological space blended with this notion we thus have a ringed space. Kruskal demonstrated that the surreals describe the asymptotic behavior of the reals. From this we can see this as part of the objects in ${Sur}$.
