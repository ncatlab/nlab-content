## Idea
A surreal space is essentially the space of [[surreal numbers]]; it can be seen as a [[vector space]] over any given surreal number [[field]].  The arithmetic properties of the surreals of course follow suit in this space. We denote the surreal space as $\mathbf{S}^n$. Any given real vector space $\mathbb{R}^m$ is by default a [[subspace]]. In a sense, $\mathbf{S}^n$ is a [[module]] over a field of [[real numbers]]. 


## Construction

Given $\mathbf{S}^n$ $\supset$ $\mathbb{R}^m$ there exists the category of modules in the former that distribute over the latter. We write ${SMod}$ for it.

###### Theorem

${SMod}$ is a module over an enriched category. 


###### Proof

Surreal space (denoted as $\mathbf{S}^n$) can be seen as a topologically enriched category of a real space $\mathbb{R}^m$. We write ${Sur}$ to denote it. Its objects are all the infinitely near points of $\mathbb{R}^m$, and all vector spaces over ordered fields. In fact, ${Sur}$ is a vector space over the reals. It is an equivalence relation acting on the reals and forms enriched modules over them. Given the concept of a topological space blended with this notion we thus have a ringed space. Kruskal demonstrated that the surreals describe the asymptotic behavior of the reals. From this we can see this as part of the objects in ${Sur}$.
