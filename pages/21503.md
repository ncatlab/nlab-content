## Idea

There may be different [[model category]]-[[mathematical structure|structures]] on the [[category]] of [[diffeological spaces]].

Of practical interest would be a model structure whose [[weak equivalences]] are the [[isomorphisms]] on standard _smooth_ [[homotopy groups]] of [[diffeological spaces]], i.e. the [[weak equivalences]] between the [[cohesive shapes]] of [[diffeological spaces]] regarded as the [[concrete objects]] in the [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] of [[smooth ∞-groupoids]]. By the discussion at _[[shape via cohesive path ∞-groupoid]]_ these are detected by smooth functions out of [[simplices]] or [[cubes]] with their canonical diffeological structure (as discussed in [Christensen-Wu 14](#ChristensenWu14)).

A model category with this property has been claimed in [Haraguchi-Shimakawa 13](#HaraguchiShimakawa13), but maybe the proof remains incomplete.

Another model category structure seems to have been securely established ([Kihara 16](#Kihara16)), but this uses a non-standard diffeology on simplices (to enforce that all smooth [[singular simplicial complexes]] are [[fibrant objects]]).

## Details


The (possibly incomplete) approach of [Haraguchi-Shimakawa 13](#HaraguchiShimakawa13) proceeds as follows:

A different model structure, however not using the standard smooth homotopy groups(!), is claimed (and published) in
