[[!redirects Differential Logic]]

## Idea ##

__Differential logic__ is the component of [[logic]] whose object is the description of variation &mdash; for example, the aspects of change, difference, distribution, and diversity &mdash; in [[universes of discourse]] that are subject to logical description.  A definition that broad naturally incorporates any study of variation by way of mathematical models, but differential logic is especially charged with the qualitative aspects of variation that pervade or precede quantitative models.  To the extent that a logical inquiry makes use of a formal system, its differential component treats the principles that govern the use of a _differential logical calculus_, that is, a formal system with the expressive capacity to describe change and diversity in a logical universe of discourse.

A simple example of a differential logical calculus is furnished by a _[[differential propositional calculus]]_.  A differential propositional calculus is a [[propositional calculus]] extended by a set of terms for describing aspects of change and difference, for example, processes that take place in a universe of discourse or transformations that map a source universe into a target universe.  This augments ordinary propositional calculus in the same way that the differential calculus of Leibniz and Newton augments the analytic geometry of Descartes.
