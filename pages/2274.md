#Idea#

A _Grothendieck connection_ $\nabla$ is a way to encode the parallel transport of a _flat_ [[connection on a bundle|connection]] along [[infinitesimal object|infinitesimal]] paths.

In the language of [[schreiber:∞-Lie theory|∞-Lie theory]] it is a morphism from the [[schreiber:infinitesimal path ∞-groupoid|infinitesimal path ∞-groupoid]] $\Pi^{inf}(X)$ of a suitable [[space]] $X$ (a [[scheme]] in [[algebraic geometry]] or, more generally, a space in [[synthetic differential geometry]]) to some [[Lie ∞-groupoid]] $A$:

$$
  \nabla : \Pi^{inf}(X) \to A
  \,.
$$

Here $\Pi^{inf}(X)$ is effectively the [[infinitesimal singular simplicial complex]] of $X$ and $A$ is modeled typically as a [[sheaf]] of [[∞-groupoid]]s as described at [[models for ∞-stack (∞,1)-toposes]].

This was originally considered by [[Alexander Grothendieck|Grothendieck]] for [[scheme]]s in the context of [[algebraic geometry]] for the case that $A$ is a 1-[[groupoid]] -- but the genralization to [[∞-groupoid]]s in [[synthetic differential geometry]] is immediate.


#Details#

In his study of [[crystalline cohomology]], [[Alexander Grothendieck|Grothendieck]] has noticed that flat [[connection on a bundle|connection]]s correspond to the [[descent]] data for [[deRham complex|deRham]] descent; he called them the costratification of the $n$-th order if one considers the $n$-the infinitesimal neighborhoods. 

Already in EGA, Grothendieck has introduced a notion of [[regular differential operator]] and of jet-spaces, which were later by Malgrange and Spencer transferred into the study of differential equations and analytic deformation theory.

De Rham descent for a relative [[scheme]] (= morphism of schemes) $f: X\to S$ is formulated in terms of resolutions or [[infinitesimal object|infinitesimal]] thickenings of the diagonal for the [[simplicial object|simplicial]] scheme 

$$
  \cdots
  X 
  \times_S X \times_S X 
  \stackrel{\to}{\stackrel{\to}{\to}}
   X \times_S X \stackrel{\to}{\to}
   X
$$

corresponding to $f$. Usually one assumes that $X$ is a [[smooth scheme]] of finite type over $S$. By separatedness the diagonal $\Delta: X\hookrightarrow X\times_S X$ is a [[closed subscheme|closed immersion of schemes]]. Let then $\mathcal{I}$ be the corresponding defining ideal sheaf (locally it is generated by the elements of the form $t\otimes 1 - 1\otimes t$, cf. [[Kähler differential]]). The definining ideal $\mathcal{I}^{n+1}$ defines for the $n$-th infinitesimal neighborhood $X^{(n)}$ and the diagonal subscheme $X\cong \Delta(X)\hookrightarrow X\times_S X$; there is a series of inclusions

$$
X\hookrightarrow X^{(1)}\hookrightarrow X^{(2)}\hookrightarrow \ldots \hookrightarrow X^{(\infty)}=\hat{X}
$$

where $\hat{X}$ is the completion (the corresponding [[formal scheme]]). Let $\mathcal{F}\to Sch$ be a [[Grothendieck fibration]] over the category of schemes (or the subcategory of the category of schemes containing all schemes in our consideration) classified under the [[Grothendieck construction]] by some [[pseudofunctor]] $A : Sch^{op} \to Cat$. A typical examples would be the [[stack]] of [[quasicoherent sheaves]] of $\mathcal{O}$-modules. 

Consider now the projections $d_0,d_1:X\times_S X\to X$. 
Then

###### Definition (Grothendieck connection)

A **Grothendieck connection** on an object $\rho\in\mathcal{F}$ is a [[descent]] datum of the form $(\rho,\theta)$ where $\theta: d_0^*\rho\to d_1^*\rho$ is an isomorphism satisfying the cocycle (and the normalization) condition and such that the restriction (pullback along inclusion) on the diagonal is the identity.

The constructions can be almost literally transferred to the [[synthetic differential geometry]] using [[infinitesimal object|infinitesimal neighborhoods]] in that setup. 

More recently, some partial generalizations were found in the purely algebraic framework. One could take any [[coring]] (or even an additive [[comonad]]) with a [[grouplike element]] and define corresponding connections and descent data and generalize the correspondence found by Grothendieck (see [[semi-free dga]] and Menini-Stefan reference below).
