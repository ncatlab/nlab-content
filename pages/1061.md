## Definition

A **pre-additive category** is an [[Ab-enriched category]] with a [[zero object]].


## Terminology

The term 'pre-additive category' is often used for *any* $Ab$-enriched category, for example in section 8 of Kashiwara--Schapira _[[Categories and Sheaves]]_.


## Remarks

* Pre-additive categories are part of a sequence of [[additive and abelian categories]].
