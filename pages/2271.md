__Maxim Kontsevich__ (born 25.8.1964.) is a Russian-French mathematician, a Professor at [IHES](http://www.ihes.fr), recipient of 1998 Fields Medal and 2008 Crafoord Prize. Some biographical data can be found at [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxim_Kontsevich), [german wikipedia](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxim_Lwowitsch_Konzewitsch) and [official CV page](http://193.51.104.7/~maxim/CVAnglais.html), some of the articles of MK can be found at [arXiv](http://arxiv.org) and most of others at [MK, official page: publications](http://193.51.104.7/~maxim/publicationsanglais.html) (there are also several unlisted preprints at [MPI server](http://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/Research/MPIM+Preprint+Series/) from the collaboration with A. Rosenberg). Much of his work has never been fully written and has been known via his public lectures and communications to other mathematicians; for example the motivic integration has been introduced in his lecture in 1996 at Orsay and never published by him; though the subject influenced and is present implicitly again in his newer (written) works. He has solved the Witten conjecture on the connection between KdV equation and gravity theory (in terms of moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces). 

Kontsevich has made contributions to various parts of mathematics and mathematical physics which inspired much of his research. One should emphasise his work on the mathematical formulation of conformal field theory (esp. 1988-1992 and again from 2002 in connection with stochastic Loewner equation with R. Friedrich and Suhov), Gromov-Witten invariants (since collaboration with Manin in Bonn, early 1990s), knot theory (Vassiliev invariant, [[quantum groups]]), $A_\infty$-categories, Landau-Ginzburg models in [[algebraic geometry]], AKSZ-model in quantum field theory, fundamental works in [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]], introducing [[homological mirror symmetry]], foundations of deformation theory, work on generalizations of determinant and trace for operators (with Vishik), Donaldson-Thomas invariants (with Soibelman), tropical geometry, nonabelian Hodge theory, noncommutative motives, various constructions with supersymmetry (esp. in geometry), derived noncommutative algebraic geometry and so on. 

Much of Kontsevich's research is based on insights on the relation between classical and quantum physics and quantizing various constructions even in pure mathematics. His most famous work in this area includes the Kontsevich formality theorem solving the problem of deformation quantization of Poisson manifolds using homological algebra and operads; this created a number of new directions of research in mathematics. Quantization ideas are also present in works related to the geometry of [[Weyl algebra]], including the progress on Jacobian conjecture. In addition to finished results Kontsevich introduced a number of stimulating conjectures which strongly influence modern mathematics.
