## Idea

Power operations are [[cohomology operations]] in [[multiplicative cohomology theory]] which are higher-degree analogs of [[cup products]]-squares [[symmetric algebra|symmetrized]] in the right [[homotopy theory|homotopy-theoretic sense]].

+-- {: .num_remark #AsPDerivations}
###### Remark

Power operations may be understood as the [[higher algebra]]-generalization of the ordinary $p$-power map $(-)^p$ on a [[commutative ring]], the one that appears in the definition of [[Fermat quotients]], [[p-derivations]] and [[Frobenius morphisms]] 

See [Lurie, from remark 2.2.7 on](#Lurie)) and see the example [below](#OnK1LocalKUAlgebras).

=--

For $E$ an [[E-∞ ring]] and $X$ a [[topological space]] ([[∞-groupoid]], [[homotopy type]]), then a map $a\;\colon\;X \to E$ is a [[cocycle]] in the [[cohomology]] of $X$ with [[coefficients]] in $E$. 

The $n$-th [[cup product]] power of this $a$ is the composite

$$
  a^n \;\colon\; X^{\times n} \stackrel{(a,\cdots,a)}{\longrightarrow} E^{\times n} \stackrel{\mu}{\longrightarrow} E
  \,,
$$

where the second map is the product operation in $E$. Since this is by assumption commutative up to coherent higher homotopy, this map factors through the [[homotopy quotient]] by the [[∞-action]] of the [[symmetric group]] $\Sigma_n$

$$
  a^n \;\colon\; X \times \ast //\Sigma_n \simeq   X^n//\Sigma_n \longrightarrow E
  \,.
$$

The cohomology class of this $E$-cocycle on $X \times B \Sigma_n$ is the $n$-th (symmetric) power of $a$.





## Examples

### Steenrod operations

On [[ordinary cohomology]] over a [[topological space]], the power operations are the [[Steenrod operations]];

  Specifically for $n = 2$ and $E = H \mathbb{Z}_2$ then the second (symmetric) power of $a \in H(X,\mathbb{Z}_2)$ is an element in $H^\bullet(\mathbb{R}P^\infty \times X, \mathbb{Z}_2) \simeq H^\bullet(X,\mathbb{Z}_2)[x]$ and the [[coefficients]] of this [[polynomial]] in $x$ are the [[Steenrod operations]] on $a$.

### Kudo-Araki-Dyer-Lashof operations

On an [[infinite loop space]] the power operations are the [[Kudo-Araki-Dyer-Lashof operations]]

### Adams operations

In the context of  [[complex K-theory]] power operations are the [[Adams operations]].

> From [this MO comment](http://mathoverflow.net/a/178627/381) by [[Akhil Mathew]]:

Let $R$ be a [[K(n)-local stable homotopy theory|K(1)-local]] [[E-∞ ring]] under ([[p-completion|p-adic]]) [[complex K-theory]] [[KU]]. Then there exists a basic power operation $\theta: \pi_0 R \to \pi_0 R$ (see [Hopkins](#Hopkins)) such that : 

*  $\psi(x) \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} x^p + p \theta(x)$ defines a ring homomorphism from $\pi_0 R \to \pi_0 R$.

* $\theta$ satisfies all the identities needed to make $\psi$ a ring-homomorphism after "division by p." For instance $\psi(x+y) = \psi(x) + \psi(y)$ implies that 

  $$
    \theta(x+y) = \theta(x) + \theta(y) + \frac{x^p - y^p - (x+y)^p}{p}
    \,,
  $$ 

  where the last term is an integral polynomial in $x,y$ and is interpreted as such. 

(see also [Rezk 09, example 1.3](#Rezk09))

This is a "$\theta$-algebra."/[[p-derivation]] as in remark \ref{AsPDerivations} above.

Note in particular that $\psi$ is a lift of the [[Frobenius homomorphism]]. There are generalizations of $\psi, \theta$ at higher [[chromatic levels]], too, and there isa modular interpretation of the resulting algebraic structure in ([Rezk 09](#Rezk09)).

By ([Strickland 98](#Strickland98)) we have that if $G$ is the [[formal group]] associated to a [[Morava E-theory]], then Frobenius lifts (twhich corresponds to degree $p^k$ subgroups of $G$) are classified by maps into $E^0(B \Sigma_{p^r})/I_{t r}$ where $I_{t r}$ is the transfer ideal. So, for example, the map $\psi$ above corresponds to a universal map $KU^0 \to KU^0(B \Sigma_p)/I_{t r} \simeq KU^0$.
