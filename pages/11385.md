## Idea

Power operations are [[cohomology operations]] in [[multiplicative cohomology theory]] which are higher-degree analogs of [[cup products]]-squares [[symmetric algebra|symmetrized]] in the right [[homotopy theory|homotopy-theoretic sense]].

For $E$ an [[E-∞ ring]] and $X$ a [[topological space]] ([[∞-groupoid]], [[homotopy type]]), then a map $a\;\colon\;X \to E$ is a [[cocycle]] in the [[cohomology]] of $X$ with [[coefficients]] in $E$. 

The $n$-th [[cup product]] power of this $a$ is the composite

$$
  a^n \;\colon\; X^{\times n} \stackrel{(a,\cdots,a)}{\longrightarrow} E^{\times n} \stackrel{\mu}{\longrightarrow} E
  \,,
$$

where the second map is the product operation in $E$. Since this is by assumption commutative up to coherent higher homotopy, this map factors through the [[homotopy quotient]] by the [[∞-action]] of the [[symmetric group]] $\Sigma_n$

$$
  a^n \;\colon\; X \times \ast //\Sigma_n \simeq   X^n//\Sigma_n \longrightarrow E
  \,.
$$

The cohomology class of this $E$-cocycle on $X \times B \Sigma_n$ is the $n$-th (symmetric) power of $a$.





## Examples

* on [[ordinary cohomology]] over a [[topological space]], the power operations are the [[Steenrod operations]];

  Specifically for $n = 2$ and $E = H \mathbb{Z}_2$ then the second (symmetric) power of $a \in H(X,\mathbb{Z}_2)$ is an element in $H^\bullet(\mathbb{R}P^\infty \times X, \mathbb{Z}_2) \simeq H^bullet(X,\mathbb{Z}_2)[x]$ and the [[coefficients]] of this [[polynomial]] in $x$ are the [[Steenrod operations]] on $a$.

* on an [[infinite loop space]] they are the Kudo-Araki-Dyer-Lashof operations

* in the context of  [[complex K-theory]] they are the [[Adams operations]]
