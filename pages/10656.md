## Idea

The Becker-Gottlieb transfer is a variant of [[push-forward in generalized cohomology]] of [[cohomology theories]] along [[proper map|proper]] [[submersions]] of [[smooth manifolds]].

The Becker-Gottlieb transfer operation has been refined to [[differential cohomology]] in ([Bunke-Gepner 13](#BunkeGepner13)).

Its compatibility in [[differential algebraic K-theory]] with the differential refinement of the [[Borel regulator]] is the content of the _transfer index conjecture_ ([Bunke-Tamme 12, conjecture 1.1](#BunkeTamme12), [Bunke-Gepner 13, conjecture 5.3](#BunkeGepner13)). 

For the moment see at _[regulator -- Becker-Gottlieb transfer](Beilinson+regulator#GottliebTransfer)_ for more.

## Definition

See e.g. ([Haugseng 13, def. 3.9](#Haugseng13)).

Becker-Gottlieb transfer was identified with the [[Umkehr map]] induced from a [[Wirthmüller context]] in which in addition $f_\ast$ satisfies its [[projection formula]] (a "[[transfer context]]", def.4.9)
