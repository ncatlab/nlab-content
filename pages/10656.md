## Idea

The Becker-Gottlieb trasfer is a variant of [[push-forward in generalized cohomology]] of [[cohomology theories]] along [[proper map|proper]] [[submersions]] of [[smooth manifolds]].

The Becker-Gottlieb transfer operation has been refined to [[differential cohomology]] in ([Bunke-Gepner 13](#BunkeGepner13)).

It's compatibility in [[differential algebraic K-theory]] with the differential refinement of the [[Borel regulator]] is the content of the _transfer index conjecture_ ([Bunke-Gepner 13, conjecture 1.1](#BunkeGepner13)). 

For the moment see at _[regulator -- Becker-Gottlieb transfer](Beilinson+regulator#GottliebTransfer)_ for more.
