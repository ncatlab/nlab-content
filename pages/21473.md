## Idea

Consider an [[exceptional field theory]] on a certain extended space, i.e. a manifold locally looking like $U\times R$, where $R$ is the underlying [[vector space]] of the [[fundamental representation]] of some [[duality]] group $G$ (e.g. [[U-duality]] or [[T-duality]]). Let us call $x$ the local coordinates of the base manifold $U$ and $(y,\tilde{y})$ the ones of the fiber $R$, called _internal manifold_.

A generalized Scherk-Schwarz reduction is performed by introducing twisting $G$-valued matrices $E^{A}_{\;\;M}(y,\tilde{y})$ and by encoding all the dependence of the fields on the coordinates of the internal manifold with the following ansatz:

$$ T^{A_1 \dots A_n}(x,y,\tilde{y}) = E^{A_1}_{\;\;M_1}(y,\tilde{y}) \cdots E^{A_n}_{\;\;M_n}(y,\tilde{y}) T^{M_1\dots M_n}(x) $$

on any tensor $T^{A_1 \dots A_n}$ on the extended space.
