## Idea

A *quotient space* is a [[quotient object]] in some [[category]] of [[spaces]], such as [[Top]] (of [[topological spaces]]), or [[Loc]] (of [[locales]]), etc.

Quotient objects in the category $Vect$ of [[vector spaces]] also traditionally use the term 'quotient space', but they are really just a special case of [[quotient module]]s, very different from the other kinds of quotient space.  Quotient [[TVSes]], however, combine both aspects.


## Definitions

### In $Top$

Let $X$ be a [[topological space]] and $\sim$ an [[equivalence relation]] on (the underlying set of) $X$.  (Since [[monomorphisms]] in [[Top]] are just [[injection|injective]] [[continuous maps]], to give an equivalence relation on the underlying set of a topological space is the same as to give a [[congruence]] on that space in $Top$.)  Let $Y = X/{\sim}$ be the [[quotient set]] and $q\colon X\to Y$ the quotient map.

The **quotient topology**, or **identification topology**, induced on $Y$ from $X$ says that a subset $U\subseteq Y$ is [[open subset|open]] if and only if $q^{-1}(U)\subseteq X$ is open.  With this topology $Y$ is a **quotient space** or **identification space** of $X$.

Obviously, up to [[homeomorphism]], all that matters is the surjective function $X\to Y$.  For the above definition, we don't even need it to be surjective, and we could generalize to a [[sink]] instead of a single map; in such a case one generally says *[[final topology]]* or *[[strong topology]]*.  See [[topological concrete category]]. 

**Remarks:** 

1. Recall that a map $q \colon X \to Y$ is [[open map|open]] if $q(U)$ is open in $Y$ whenever $U$ is open in $X$. It is not the case that a quotient map $q \colon X \to Y$ is necessarily open. Indeed, the identification map $q \colon I \sqcup \{\ast\} \to S^1$, where the endpoints of $I$ are identified with $\ast$, takes the open point $\ast$ of the domain to a non-open point in $S^1$. 

1. Nor is it the case that a quotient map is necessarily a closed map; the classic example is the projection map $\pi_1 \colon \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$, which projects the closed locus $x y = 1$ onto a non-closed subset of $\mathbb{R}$. (This is a quotient map, by the next remark.) 

1. It is easy to prove that a continuous open surjection $p \colon X \to Y$ is a quotient map. For instance, projection maps $\pi \colon X \times Y \to Y$ are quotient maps, provided that $X$ is inhabited. Likewise, a continuous closed surjection $p: X \to Y$ is a quotient map: $p^{-1}(U)$ is open $\Rightarrow$ $p^{-1}(\neg U)$ is closed $\Rightarrow$ $p(p^{-1}(\neg U)) = \neg U$ is closed $\Rightarrow$ $U$ is open. For example, a continuous surjection from a compact space to a Hausdorff space is a quotient map. 

### In $Loc$

A quotient space in $Loc$ is given by a [[regular subobject]] in [[Frm]].
