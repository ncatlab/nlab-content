## Idea

In [[cosmology]] and [[particle physics]],  by _baryogenesis_ one refers to the process by which an abundance of [[baryons]] is produced in the early [[observable universe]], leading to the baryonic [[matter]] seen all around. Since in the [[standard model of particle physics]] [[matter]] and [[antimatter]] are _essentially_ always produced symmetrically ("conservation of baryon number"), the topic of baryogenesis is to a large extent the study of how the matter/antimatter symmetry may be [[broken symmetry|broken]].

([Sakharov 67](#Sakharov67)) formulated three conditions jointly necessary for matter/antimatter asymmetry leading to baryogenesis in the early universe, now known as the _Sakharov conditions_

1. violation of baryon number conservation;

1. [[CP problem|C and CP violation]]

1. departure from thermal equilibrium.

Indeed, by a [[quantum anomaly]] in the [[standard model of particle physics]], the _[[axial anomaly]]_ (a [[chiral anomaly]]) (see e.g. [Jackiw 08](#Jackiw08)),  the [[divergence]] of the baryon number [[current]] does not quite vanish but is ([t'Hooft 76](#Hooft76)) in traditional physics notation

$$
  \partial_\mu j_b^\mu 
   = 
  \partial_\mu j_L^\mu
   =
  n_f
  \left(
    \frac{g^2}{32 \pi^2}
    W_{\mu \nu}^\alpha \tilde W^{\alpha \mu \nu}
    -
    \frac{{g'}^2}{32\pi^2} \epsilon_{\mu \nu \rho \sigma} F^{\mu \nu} F^{\rho \sigma}
  \right) 
 \,,
$$

where $F_\nabla$ is the [[field strength]] of the [[electroweak field]] (the [[curvature]] of a $SU(2)$-[[principal connection]] $\nabla$).

(see  e.g. [Dine 90, (4)](#Dine90) [Trodden-Carroll, 4.9.3](#TroddenCarroll), [Shu 08, (7.6)](#Shu08)).

In more intrinsic notation and ignoring numerical constants, the statement is that 

$$
  \mathbf{d} \star j_b = \langle F_\nabla \wedge F_\nabla \rangle
  \,.
$$

Properly interpreted (this is rarely stated in the literature...) this is the _local_ expression for the [[connection on a 3-bundle|3-connection]] on the [[Chern-Simons line 3-bundle]] associated with the gauge field. If the latter is globally nontrivial in that it is in an _[[instanton]]_-sector (has nontrivial [[second Chern class]]), then the [[integral]] of $\langle F\wedge F\rangle$ over closed manifolds is an integer -- the "[[instanton]] number" -- and in conclusion there is baryon generation proportional to this number (physics lingo also: _sphaleron transitions_).

Notice that this would mean that baryons "are" a kind of topological twist, different from, but not entirely unlike to the old idea of _[[On Vortex Atoms]]_. See there at _[Similarlity to concepts of modern particle physics](On+Vortex+Atoms#SimilarityToParticlePhysics)_

That this process was at least one source of baryogenesis in the early universe is plausible but not certain. The process is heavily suppressed by inverse energy/temperature (e.g. [Dine 90, around (9)](#Dine90)) and out of reach of conceivable experiments in the present age of the universe, but plausibly may have occurred in the very early universe -- just as it should be for realistic baryogenesis.
