###Disambigation

This entry is about 'generalized Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces' as used in Stable Homotopy Theory. The same term is used for a related concept, namely the representing fibration for [[ twisted cohomology|cohomology with local coefficients]]. That cohomology is also called [[twisted cohomology]] so we have used the term [[twisted Eilenberg - Mac Lane space]] for this second use. 



## Idea

A _generalized Eilenberg-Mac Lane space_ is a [[topological space]] with the [[homotopy type]] of a [[Cartesian product]] of (finitely many) [[Eilenberg-MacLane spaces]].

Accordingly a _generalized Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectrum_ is a [[spectrum]] equivalent to a [[wedge sum]] of [[Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectra]].

## Applications

* Generalized Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectra appear as [[coefficients]] in an [[Adams resolution]] used in the [[Adams spectral sequence]].

*Theorem.* Let $R$ be a commutative ring with a unit and let $fMod_R$ be the category of finitely generated free $R$-modules. If $H\colon fMod_R\to Spaces$ is a functor such that 

* $H(0)$ is a contractible space, 
* $H(R)$ is connected and for every $ n$ the projections $pr_k \colon R^n\to R$ induce a weak equivalence $ H(R^n) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}  H(R)^n$ 

then the space $ H(R)$ is weakly equivalent to a product $\prod_{i=1}^{\infty} K(M_i , i)}$ where $M_i$ is an $ R$-module. 

**Proof.** This is the main theorem of [Badzioch]
