###Disambigation

This entry is about 'generalized Eilenberg-MacLane spaces' as used in Stable Homotopy Theory. The same term is used for a related concept, namely the representing fibration for [[ twisted cohomology|cohomology with local coefficients]]. That cohomology is also called [[twisted cohomology]] so we have used the term [[twisted Eilenberg - Mac Lane space]] for this second use. 



## Idea

A _generalized Eilenberg-MacLane space_ is a [[topological space]] with the [[homotopy type]] of a [[Cartesian product]] of (finitely many) [[Eilenberg-MacLane spaces]].

Accordingly a _generalized Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum_ is a [[spectrum]] equivalent to a [[smash product]] of [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectra]].

## Applications

* Generalized Eilenberg-MacLane spectra appear as [[coefficients]] in an [[Adams resolution]] used in the [[Adams spectral sequence]].
