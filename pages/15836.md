## Idea

[[mathematics|Mathematically]], [[quantum mechanics]], and in particular [[quantum statistical mechanics]], can be viewed as a generalization of [[probability theory]].  The [[Bayesianism|Bayesian]] interpretation of probability can then be generalized to a Bayesian interpretation of quantum mechanics, and thus (in principle) of all [[physics]].


## Formalism

There are various ways to formulate [[quantum mechanics]] mathematically, but the following elements are fairly common (see also at _[[JBW-algebraic quantum mechanics]]_):

*  There is an algebra $A$ of [[observables]]; some or all of the elements of this algebra correspond to physically observable quantities.
*  There is a space $S$ of [[states]], by which we mean [[mixed states]] in general.
*  Given a state $\psi$ and an observable $O$, we obtain a [[probability distribution]] (a [[probability measure]] on the [[real line]] or something like it).

Roughly speaking, this probability distribution tells us the probability of observing the value of $O$ to take particular values given that the system has state $\psi$.  Let us write $O_*\psi(E)$ for the probability that the value of $O$ will be observed to belong to the [[measurable set]] $E$ for a system in state $\psi$.

So for example, we could actually be talking about a [[classical physics|classical]] system, in which we have a [[state space]] or [[phase space]] $X$, an observable is a function on $X$, a [[pure state]] is a point in $X$, and a general state is a probability measure on $X$.

Or we could be talking about a quantum system given by a [[Hilbert space]] $H$, in which an observable is a [[self-adjoint operator]] on $H$, a pure state is a $1$-dimensional subspace of $H$, and a general state is a [[density matrix]] on $H$.

Or we could use a more abstract formulation, such as those of [[AQFT]], [[FQFT]], and so forth; but all of these still have observables and states.


## Interpretation

The point of the Bayesian interpretation is that the probabilities $O_*\psi(E)$ are to be interpreted as Bayesian probabilities.  That is, they are not objective features of reality (the territory) but rather an expression of what a rational observer might know about the world (a map).

Thus, a state $\psi$ represents a _state of knowledge_ about the world.  The algebra $A$ of observables may be objective (or fully known), but the particular state $\psi$ that the system is in depends on what is known about that particular system.  There is (except in the classical case) *no* possible complete specification of the actual values of all observables, only a probabilistic specification of what one might know about them.

In the [[Schroedinger picture]] (assuming a notion of [[time]]), states evolve deterministically, unitarily, and with conservation of [[entropy]].  (Or in the [[Heisenberg picture]], they don\'t evolve at all.)  But a state may change otherwise, if one\'s knowledge changes.  If this is an increase in knowledge as a result of a [[measurement]], then this change in the state may be called the 'collapse of the wavefunction'.  But this collapse takes place in the map, not the territory; unlike time evolution, it is not a physical process.

Given a specification of $S$ and $A$, it may be that there exist certain states $\psi$ in $S$ such that $O_*\psi$ is a [[delta measure]] (giving a probability of $1$ for one value and $0$ for all others) for every $O$ in $A$.  Then the system is classical.  Depending on the mathematical formalism used, such states may not actually belong to $S$ (which might, for example, own only the [[absolutely continuous measure|absolutely continuous]] probability measures in some sense, as is natural in the [[JBW-algebraic quantum mechanics|W*-algebraic approach]]); so in general, we say that the system is __classical__ if there exists a [[net]] $(\psi_n)_n$ of states such that, for each observable $O$, the net $(O_*\psi_n)_n$ of measures on the real line [[convergence in measure|converges in measure]] to a delta measure.  (Hopefully this is general enough!)


## History

People have implied (for example at the beginning of [Caves, Fuchs, & Schack, 2001](#CFS2001)) that this is what [[Niels Bohr]] meant all along when he put forth the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] (for more on this suggestion see also at _[[Bohr topos]]_), and people have implied (in the first paper at [Fuchs, ongoing](#Fuchs)) that it is what [[Albert Einstein]] was groping towards when he attacked Bohr, and still others ([[Ray Streater]] as cited in [Wikimedia Foundation, ongoing](#Wikimedia)) have implied that it is what [[John von Neumann]] was doing when he eschewed interpretation for mathematical axioms.  Any time that somebody has described a quantum state as containing information, or being given by an experimenter\'s knowledge, or being different for one observer than for another, the Bayesian interpretation is implicit.  Arguably, it is implicit in any statement that the wavefunction describes probabilities, if [[probability]] is treated as Bayesian.  However, the *explicit* exposition of this interpretation seems to have come rather late.

The earliest linking of Bayesianism to quantum states as states of knowledge, as far as I have found, is Usenet discussion in 1994 ([Baez et al, 2003](#Baez2003)).  [[John Baez]] was promoting similar ideas the previous year ([Baez, 1993](#Baez1993)), but here he does not yet say 'Bayes'.  The idea of a 'Bayesian interpretation' came to prominence in 2001, drawing out of work on [[quantum information theory]] ([Caves, Fuchs, & Schack, 2001](#CFS2001)).  Further work has been done principally by [[Christopher Fuchs]] ([Fuchs, ongoing](#Fuchs)).  Fuchs\'s approach to Bayesianism has become increasingly subjectivist, making the links to [[quantum information theory]] less fundamental.  (In contrast, the description above is primarily in terms of the objectivist school of Bayesianism.)
