1-categorical descent can be formulated in several ways, most traditional is due Grothendieck via [[Grothendieck fibration|fibered categories]] or equivalently pseudofunctors. 

Monadic descent focuses on a situation in which a considered morphism induces an [[adjunction]]  $F\dashv U$ where $F:A\leftrightarrow B:U$ and we ask weather $U$ is a [[monadic functor]]. 

In more detail, the adjunction $F\dashv U$ with unit $\eta:1_B \to UF$ and counit $\epsilon: FU\to 1_A$ induces the [[monad]] $\mathbf{T}= (T,\mu,\eta)$ in $B$ via $T:=UF$, $\mu:=U\epsilon F:UFUF\to UF$ with unit $\eta$. Monad $\mathbf{T}$ generates the [[Eilenberg-Moore category]] $B^{\mathbf{T}}$ of modules (= algebras) over $\mathbf{T}$ that is the pairs $(M,\nu)$ where $M\in Ob(B)$ and $\nu:TM\to M$ satisfies the action axioms $T(\nu)\circ \nu= \nu_T \circ\nu$ and $\nu\circ\eta_M=id_M$. There is a **comparison functor** 

$$ K : A\to B^{\mathbf{T}}, \,\,\,\, K(N) := (U(N),U(\epsilon_N)). $$

We say that the functor $U$ is monadic or more informally that $A$ is monadic over $B$ if the comparison functor is an [[equivalence]] of categories. Sometimes one is interested in a weaker statement weather the comparison functor is fully faithful. 

The main theorem is Beck's [[monadicity theorem]].

Given a Grothendieck bifibration $p:F\to B$ and a morphism $f:b\to b'$ in the base category $B$, one can choose a direct image $f_!$ and a inverse image functor $f^*$ which form an adjunction $f_!\dashv f^*$. Under some conditions (see [[Benabou-Roubaud theorem]]), the morphism $f$ is an effective descent morphism (with respect to $p$ as a [[fibered category]]) iff the comparison functor for the monad induced by the adjunction $f_!\dashv f^*$ is monadic. 

We should now see that some instances of categories of descent data are canonically equivalent to and can be reexpressed via Eilenberg-Moore categories of monads, or dually comonads.
