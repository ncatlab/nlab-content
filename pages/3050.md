## Idea

Monadic descent is a way to encode [[descent]] using algebraic tools, notably [[monad]]s and related structures from [[universal algebra]].

1-categorical [[descent]] can be formulated in several ways; the most traditional is due [[Alexander Grothendieck|Grothendieck]] via [[Grothendieck fibration|fibered categories]] $E \to B$ or equivalently [[pseudofunctor]]s. 

**Monadic descent** focuses on a situation in which a morphism $f : b_1 \to b_2$ in the base $B$ induces an [[adjunction]] $F\dashv U$ where 

$$
  F \;:\; E_{b_1} =: A\leftrightarrow B := E_{b_2} \;:\; U
$$ 

and we ask whether $U$ is a [[monadic functor]]. 


## Details

In more detail, the adjunction, $F\dashv U$ with unit $\eta:1_B \to U \circ F$ and counit $\epsilon: F \circ U\to 1_A$, induces the [[monad]] $\mathbf{T}= (T,\mu,\eta)$ in $B$ via $T\coloneqq U F$, $\mu\coloneqq U\epsilon F:U F U F\to U F$ with unit $\eta$. The monad $\mathbf{T}$ generates the [[Eilenberg–Moore category]] $B^{\mathbf{T}}$ of modules (= algebras) over $\mathbf{T}$, that is the pairs $(M,\nu)$ where $M\in Ob(B)$ and $\nu:T M\to M$ satisfies the action axioms $T(\nu)\circ \nu= \nu_T \circ\nu$ and $\nu\circ\eta_M=id_M$. There is a **comparison functor** 

$$ K : A\to B^{\mathbf{T}}, \,\,\,\, K(N) \coloneqq  (U(N),U(\epsilon_N)). $$

We say that the functor $U$ is [[monadic functor|monadic]] or more informally that $A$ is monadic over $B$ if the comparison functor is an [[equivalence of categories]]. Sometimes one is interested in a weaker condition: whether the comparison functor is [[fully faithful functor|fully faithful]]. 


## Main theorems

The main theorem is Beck's [[monadicity theorem]].

Given a Grothendieck [[bifibration]] $p:E\to B$ and a morphism $f:b\to b'$ in the base category $B$, one can choose a [[direct image]] $f_!:E_b\to E_{b'}$ and an [[inverse image]] functor $f^*:E_{b'}\to E_b$, which form an [[adjunction]] $f_!\dashv f^*$. Under some conditions (see the [[Bénabou–Roubaud theorem]]), the morphism $f$ is an effective descent morphism (with respect to $p$ as a [[fibered category]]) iff the comparison functor for the [[monad]] induced by the adjunction $f_!\dashv f^*$ is monadic. 

We should now see that some instances of categories of [[descent]] data are canonically equivalent to and can be reexpressed via [[Eilenberg-Moore category|Eilenberg–Moore categories]] of monads, or dually comonads. 


## Examples

### Monadic descent for codomain fibrations {#ForCodomainFibs}

One of the most basic examples of [[bifibration]]s are [[codomain fibration]]s. Accordingly, monadic descent applied to codomain fibrations archetypically exhibits the nature of monadic descent. We therefore spell out this example is some detail.

Other examples of monadic descent often find a useful interpretation when relating them back to monadic descent for codomain fibrations. For instance the (co)monadic descent for [[Sweedler coring]]s, discussed below, finds a natural geometric interpretion this way (as discussed in detail there).


#### Motivation: failure of push-forward for principal bundles

Monadic methods can be applied to the study of descent of structures that cannot only be pulled back, such as [[principal bundle]]s, but that can also be pushed forward, such as [[vector bundle]]s (with suitable care taken) or more generally [[module]]s over functions rings (discussed at [[Sweedler coring]]).


Given a [[principal bundle]] $P \to X$ (a topological one, say, i.e. a morphism in [[Top]]) and a morphism of base spaces $f : X \to Z$, the would-be candidate for the push-forward of $P$ along $f$ is simply the composite map
$P \to X \to Z$, regarded as a total space $P \to Z$ liveing over $Z$.

While that always exists as such, it will in general not be a principal bundle anymore: the [[fiber]]s of $P \to Z$ over points $z \in Z$ consist of many copies of the fibers of $P \to X$ over points in $X$. Hence the shape of the fibers may change drastically as we push bundles forward.

So principal bundles do have a canonical notion of push-forward, but it leads outside the category of principal bundles and lands generally in some [[overcategory]].

On the other hand, as we will see in detail below, if we take a principal bundle $P \to X$ and

* first push it forward in this generalized sens to an object $P \to Z$ in the [[overcategory]] $Top/Z$

* and **then** pull back the result of that again along $X \to Z$ the result, while still not a principal bundle, is the total space $P$ of the bundle pulled back to the first term in the [[Cech nerve]] of $f : X \to Z$. This pullback is of central interest in the description of the geometric [[descent]] property of the bundle. 

But the composite operation of pushforward of overcategories

$$
  push(f) : Top/X \to Top/Z
$$

followed by pullback

$$
  pull(f) : Top/Z \to Top/X
$$

is nothing but the [[monad]] associated to $f : X \to Z$ with respect to the [[codomain fibration|codomain bifibration]] $cod : [I,Top] \to Top$.

So by regarding principal bundles $P \to X$ more generally as just objects in the [[overcategory]] $Top/X$ we make the tools of monadic descent applicable to them.

#### The monad

Let $C$ be a [[category]] with [[pullback]]s. Then the [[codomain fibration]]

$$
  cod : [I,C] \to C
$$

is a [[bifibration]] (as described there, in detail). Its [[fiber]] over an object $X \in C$ is the [[overcategory]] $C/X$. 

The direct image operation $push(f)$ associated to a morphism $\pi : Y \to X$ in $C$ is the functor

$$
  push(\pi) : C/Y \to  C/X
$$

obtained by postcomposition with $f$, which sends $(P \to Y) \in C/Y$ to the composite $P \to Y \stackrel{\pi}{\to} X$ in $C$, regarded as an object of $C/X$.

The inverse image operation $pull(f)$ associated to $f$ is the functor

$$
  C/Y \leftarrow C/X : pull(\pi)
$$

obtained by [[pullback]] in $C$ along $\pi$, which sends $(Q \to X) \in C/X$ the [[pullback]] $Q \times_X Y$, regarded as an object of $C/Y$ in terms of the canonical projection morphism $Q \times_X Y\to Y$ out of the pullback.

Write

$$
  T_\pi = pull(\pi) \circ push(\pi) : C/Y \to C/Y 
$$

for the [[monad]] built from these two [[adjoint functor]]s.

#### The bar construction

The action of this [[monad]] is usefully studied by looking at the [[bar construction]] that it induces.

To that end, let $(P, \rho)$

$$
  P : {*} \to C/Y
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \array{
      && C/Y
      \\ 
      & {}^{\mathllap{P}}
     \nearrow  &\Downarrow^{\rho}& \searrow^{\mathrlap{T}}
     \\
    {*} &&\stackrel{P}{\to}&& C/Y
  }
$$

be an [[monad|algebra over]] our monad. We spell out the [[bar construction]] for this:

In first degree we find that applying our monad once yield the object $T P$ which is given by

* first pushing $P \to Y$ forward along $\pi : Y \to X$ to the object $P \to Y \to X$.

* then pulling this back along $\pi$ to yield the left vertical morphism in

  $$
    \array{
      Y \times_X P &\to& P
      \\
      \downarrow && \downarrow
      \\
      && Y
      \\
      \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\pi}}
      \\
      Y &\stackrel{\pi}{\to}& X
    }
    \,.
  $$

  This [[pullback]] along a composite of morphisms may be computed as two consecutive pullbacks. The first one is

  $$
    \array{
      Y \times_X Y &\to& Y
      \\
      \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\pi}}
      \\
      Y &\stackrel{\pi}{\to}& X 
    }
  $$

  which is the first term in the [[Cech nerve]] of $\pi$. So the total pullback is the pullback $P$ to $Y\times_X Y$:

  $$
    \array{
      (Y \times_X Y) \times_Y P &\to& P
      \\
      \downarrow && \downarrow
      \\
      Y \times_X Y &\to& Y
      \\
      \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\pi}}
      \\
      Y &\stackrel{\pi}{\to}& X
    }
    \,.
  $$
  
Therefore the action 

$$
  \rho : T A \to A
$$

of our [[monad]] on $P$ is a morphism

is given in $C$ by a morphism

$$
  \array{
    (Y \times_X Y) \times_Y P &&\stackrel{\rho}{\to}&&
    P
    \\
    & \searrow && \swarrow
    \\
    && Y
  }
  \,.
$$

As an example, think of this in the context $C = Top$ with $\pi Y \to X$ coming froman open [[cover]] $\{U_i \to X\}$ of $X$ with $Y = \sqcup_i U_i$, and with $P = Y \times G$ a trivial $G$-[[principal bundle]] for some [[group]] $G$. Then the space $Y \times_X Y = \coprod_{i j} U_i \cap U_j$ is the union of double intersection of covering patches, and $(Y \times_X Y) \times_Y P = (\coprod_{i j} U_i \cap U_j \times G)$ is to be thought of as the trivial $G$-principal bundle over $U_j$, restricted to the intersection. In this case our morphism $\rho$ acts as

$$
  \rho : \coprod_{i j} : (U_i \cap U_j \times G) \to \coprod_i U_i \times G
$$

and thus maps the trivial $G$-bundle over $U_j$ on the intersection with the trivial $G$-bundle over $U_i$. So it is a _transition function_ . If this is a $G$-equivariant, it may be part of the  [[descent]] datum for the $G$-[[principal bundle]].

### Comomadic descent for modules, using Sweedler corings

Descent for a [[Sweedler coring]] is comonadic descent. See there for more details and geometric interpretations.
