## Definition

Let $U$ be a [[subterminal object]] of a [[topos]].  Then $o_U(V)\coloneqq (U\Rightarrow V)$ defines a [[Lawvere-Tierney topology]] on $E$, whose corresponding [[subtopos]] is called the **open subtopos** associated to $U$.

The reflector into the topos of sheaves can be constructed explicitly as $O_U(X) = X^U$.
