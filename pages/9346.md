## What is string theory?

   (short answer: _perturbative_ string theory is well-defined idea which is a natural variation of perturbative QFT, (namely...), and mostly this is the default meaning of string theory. A non-perturbative formulation however remains mysterious, even though there are various educated guesses. Sometimes the unknown non-perturbative formulation is referred to as a "theory" and lots of confusion arises.)

## Does string theory make predictions? Is string theory testable?

  (short answer: most every theory and model in physics has parameters and makes predictions only after sufficiently many parameters have been fixed by measuring them in experiment. For instance Newton's theory of gravity says that the gravitational force of a point source is proportional to one over the square of the distance. This is the theory, the proportionality factor has to be fixed by experiment. In string theory it's the same general principle, only that the theory is much richer. There are tons of models in string theory that make very detailed statements about the resulting physics. Moreover, many of these have good general agreement with presently observed data (just see at [[G2-MSSM]] for an example), so this is as in traditional model building. The remaining problem is the following, and this is not specific to string theory but faced by any theory that provides a UV-completion of the standard model: the problem is that after parameters have been fixed this way by finding a model that reproduces the  standard model reasonably accurately, all the remaining properties of the model which are he predictions of the model tend to be at high energies ("Planck scale") and hence not within reach of experiment in the foreseeable future. This is a very general aspect of present particle physics: while _theoretically_ it is clear that the standard model must have a UV-completion by _something_, at presently available experimental energies that standard model works perfectly. While this is a general fact of particle physics and model building, not special to string theory, a sociological aspect of string theory is that in the 1980s many theoreticians started to believe and claim that string theory would be better than ordinary model building in that when fully understood it would admit only very few models, such that even the parameters measured in the standard model would be predicted by the theory+some mode basic parameters. More recently this hope has vanished, and much of what should be an absolute estimate of string theory is more a perception in the gradient of this hope. But one technical specialty of string theory over standard model building certainly exists in either case: what in the standard model are external parameters put into a QFT Lagrangian, in string theory models are all dynamical fields of the theory instead. The simple familiar example to compare this to is the cosmological constant in Einstein gravity: one can either consider it as an external parameter, a constant real number coefficient in front of the volume form summand of the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian, or else one can consider Einstein gravity coupled to a scalar field with some potential and consider those solutions to the equations of motion where this field is is almost constant to good approximation. Then the field itself serves as an effective cosmological constant. Hence the theory has one less external parameter, which has instead been replaced by a field. In string theory this happens with _all_ parameters. There is no external choice of parameter, but there remains the choice of studying "solutions to the equations of motion" (which in string theory means: choices of 2d CFTs) which might model observed physics. That's why in string theory instead of adjusting parameters one searches solutions. Since these are also called "vacua", one searches vacua. The infamous term "landscape of string theory vacua" refers to attempts to understand the space of possibilities here more globally. But very little is actually known.) In summary: models in string theory make predictions just as any other model in physics does. Moreover, the situation is even slightly better in that in principle the choice of model in string theory is constrained by the theory. While the standard model is just written to paper, when one reproduces approximations to it in string theory one has to check that a host of consistency conditions are satisfied. Nevertheless, despite of this higher predictivity in principle, in practice it has not lead to much insight that would actually affect the standard model in practice.


## Did string theory provide any insight that affected recent progress in experimental particle physics, such as the discsovery of the Higgs-boson like particle?

  Yes. One curious aspect of string theory is that independently of its role as a source for models in particle physics, it provides connections in the space of all possible quantum field theories: lots of different quantum field theories (many of them highly unrealistic as phenomenology goes, but interesting for theoretical investigations) appear as different limits and special cases inside string theory, and their embedding into a single framework this way explains many unexpected relations between them. One of this has led to recent progress simply in computional tools of perturbation series. LHC physicists claimed that without the insight from string theory, the evaluation software used at the LHC ould not have been precise enough to see the Higgs in the data. Details on this are linked to at [[string theory results applied elsewhere]]. This is maybe the example most directly related to experimental physics, but there are varius other relations ("dualiteis") between QFTs learned from or better understood with string theory. (Seiberg duality for instance, long list will go here...)

## What if the answer to the above questions in No, or at least I don't follow the arguments for why it should be Yes, is string theory then without any merit?
