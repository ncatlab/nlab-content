### What is string theory?
 {#WhatIsStringTheory}

What is called _[[perturbative string theory]]_ is a variant of _[[perturbation theory]]_ in _[[quantum field theory]]_ (QFT). 

One way that the latter is defined is as a means to compute [[n-point functions]] in QFT as a [[formal power series]] [[sum|summing]] over labelled [[graphs]] (called _[[Feynman diagrams]]_) of the [[correlators]] of a 1-dimensional [[QFT]] defined on these graphs (the _[[worldline]] [[theory]]_ of the [[particles]]/[[virtual particles]] whose [[scattering amplitude]] is expressed by the [[n-point function]]). As a variant of this, the _[[string perturbation series]]_ is defined to be a similar series, but instead of over 1-dimensional graphs now over 2-dimensional [[surfaces]] ("[[worldsheet|worldsheets]]") and instead of summing correlators of a 1d QFT, summing correlators of a 2-dimensional QFT, specifically a [[2d CFT]].

The premise of _[[perturbative string theory]]_ as a [[theory (physics)|theory]] about the [[observable universe|observable world]] is that fundamental scattering processes such as observed in [[particle accelerator]] experiments and which are to good approximation described by the [[Feynman diagram|Feynman]] [[perturbation series]] of the [[standard model of particle physics]] are more accurately described by such a [[string perturbation series]].

More conceptually, the premise is that 

1. the [[standard model of particle physics]] and [[gravity]] is just an [[effective field theory]] (this is generally expected, independently of string theory)

1. that a string perturbation series can provide its [[UV-completion]].


While the string perturbation series is a well-defined expression analogous to the Feynman perturbation series, by itself it lacks a _conceptual_ property of the latter: the Feynman perturbation series is known, in principle, to be the approximation to _something_, namely to the corresponding complete hence [[non-perturbative quantum field theory]]. The idea is that the string perturbation series is similarly the approximation to something, to something which would then be called _[[non-perturbative string theory]]_, but that something has not been identified.

This situation is analogous to the following simple setup: the theory of [[smooth functions]] on the [[real line]] can be approximated by the theory of [[Taylor series]]. Now the notion of Taylor series has some variants, say to the theory of [[species]]. But then the question arises: what is to species as Taylor series were to smooth functions?

There are a host of educated guesses of what non-perturbative string theory might be, if anything, but it remains unknown. At some point the term _[[M-theory]]_ had been established for whatever that non-perturbative theory is, but even though it already has a name, it still remains unknown.

Therefore if the qualification "perturbative"/"non-perturbative" is suppresed, then the term "string theory" is quite ambiguous and has frequently led to misunderstanding. Perturbative string theory is a well defined and formally suggestive variant of established perturbation theory in QFT. Non-Perturbative string theory on the other hand is a hypothetical refinement of this perturbative theory of which there are maybe some hints, but which by and large remains mysterious, if it exists at all.


### Does string theory make predictions? How?
 {#HowDoesStringTheoryMakePredictions}

String theory makes predictions much as [[quantum field theory]] does, too: the theory predicts observables once a [[model (physics)|model]] has been chosen.

Most every [[theory (physics)|theory]] and [[model (in theoretical physics)|model]] in [[physics]] has parameters and makes predictions only after sufficiently many parameters have been fixed by measuring them in experiment. 

For instance Newton's theory of [[gravity]] says that the gravitational [[force]] of a pointlike [[mass]] is proportional to the inverse square of the distance from that mass. This is the theory, the proportionality factor (now called [[gravitational constant|Newton's constant]]) is the free parameter that has to be fixed by experiment. 

In string theory as in any other theory of physics, it is the same general principle, only that the theory is much richer. There are lots of [[model (in theoretical physics)|models]] in string theory that make very detailed statements about the resulting physics. Moreover, many of these have good general agreement with presently observed data (an class of examples is discussed at _[[G2-MSSM]]_), so this is as in traditional model building. See at _[[string phenomenology]]_ for further pointers.

The remaining problem is the following, and this is not specific to string theory but faced by any theory that provides a [[UV-completion]] of the standard model plus gravity ([[quantum gravity]]): the problem is that after parameters have been fixed this way by finding a model that reproduces the  standard model reasonably accurately, all the remaining properties of the model,  hence the predictions of the model, tend to be at high energies ("[[Planck scale]]") and hence not within reach of of present experiment.

This is a very general aspect of present particle physics: while _theoretically_ it is clear that the standard model must have a UV-completion by _something_, at presently available experimental energies that standard model works rather perfectly. While this is a general fact of particle physics and model building, not special to string theory, a sociological aspect of string theory is that in the 1980s many theoreticians started to believe and claim that string theory would be better than ordinary model building in that when fully understood it would admit only very few models, such that even the parameters measured in the standard model would be predicted by the theory and some more basic parameters. More recently this hope has vanished, and much of what should be an absolute estimate of string theory is more a perception in the negative gradient of this hope curve. 

But one technical specialty of string theory over QFT model building exists in either case: what in the standard model are external parameters put into a QFT [[Lagrangian]], in string theory models are all dynamical fields of the theory instead:

The simple familiar example to compare this to is the [[cosmological constant]] in Einstein gravity: one can either consider it as an external parameter, a constant real number coefficient in front of the [[volume form]] summand of the [[Einstein-Hilbert action|Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian]], or else one can consider Einstein gravity coupled to a [[scalar field]] with some potential and consider those solutions to the [[equations of motion]] where this field is is almost constant to good approximation. Then the field itself serves as an effective cosmological constant. (This is the mechanism behind the theory of _[[cosmic inflation]]_, see there for more details.) Hence the theory has one less external parameter (the "cosmological constant" is not fundamentally really a constant), which has instead been replaced by a [[field (physics)|field]]. 

In string theory this happens with _all_ parameters. There is no external choice of parameter, but there remains the choice of studying "solutions to the equations of motion" (which in string theory means: choices of 2d [[CFT]]s) which might model observed physics. 

That is why in string theory instead of adjusting parameters one searches solutions. Since these are also called "[[vacua]]", one searches vacua. The infamous term "[[landscape of string theory vacua]]" refers to attempts to understand the space of possibilities here more globally. But very little is actually known to date. 

In summary: [[model (in theoretical physics)|models]] built in string theory make predictions just as any other [[model (in theoretical physics)|model]] in theoretical physics does. 
The situation is actually better in that in principle the choice of model in string theory is constrained by the theory. While the [[standard model of particle physics]] is just written to paper, when one reproduces approximations to it in string theory one has to check that various consistency conditions are satisfied which guarantee that the parameters assumed indeed do arise as configurations of the fields in the theory. 

Notice that there is no a priori reason in [[quantum field theory]] that of all of the huge space of possible field theories (all [[local Lagrangians]]) the one that describes our world is a [[Yang-Mills theory|Yang-Mills]] [[gauge theory]] coupled to [[gravity]]. This is not a prediction of QFT but an assumption, and only after this assumption is made, and only after a few dozen further parameters are fixed by hand, does the standard model of particle physics start to make any predictions at all. On  the other hand, string theory does predict this general form of action functionals: the [[effective field theories]] obtained in string theory are generally [[gauge theories]] coupled to [[gravity]]. This fact is what originally led to the strong interest in string theory.

Nevertheless, in spite of this higher predictivity of string theory in principle, in practice it has not yet lead to much insight that would actually affect particle physics models in practice.


### Is string theory testable?
 {#IsStringTheoryTestable}

This question overlaps with the question _[How does string theory make predictions?](#HowDoesStringTheoryMakePredictions)_, but it maybe deserves its own answer.

In both [[QFT]] as well as [[string theory]] one  "builds [[model (in theoretical physics)|models]]" within the general theory and tests these, as far as their predictions are about available experiments. Loads of string theoretic models and non string-theoretic models have been excluded by [[LHC]] data in 2021, when the experiment ruled out more and more of the possible parameter space for one [[global supersymmetry|global]] [[spacetime]] [[supersymmetry]] somewhere at the [[electroweak symmetry breaking]] scale (see also _[Does string theory predict supersymmetry](#DoesSTPredictSupersymmetry)_ below). So all this was testable, has been tested and turned out to be wrong.

So [[model (in theoretical physics)|model]] building in string theory is much as in QFT. When a model is ruled out, it does not necessarily mean that string theory is ruled out or that QFT is ruled out, but it means that the possibilities for adjusting the free parameters in the theory are being reduced. 

To see that this is a common scientific process, it may help to look at some important historical examples. For instance shortly after [[Einstein]] proposed the theory of [[gravity]] now named after him, he proposed a [[cosmology|cosmological]] [[model (in theoretical physics)|model]] within that theory. Since he thought back then that the [[observable universe]] was static, he chose a free parameter of his theory, the [[cosmological constant]], to take just such a value that the resulting equations of motion fitted his expectations. But just shortly afterwards it became clear that this is wrong, that instead the observable universe is expanding. Was Einstein's theory wrong? No, his model within the theory was wrong. (He famously called it his "biggest blunder", but it's common for models to be ruled out. It's fundametally a trial and error process, after all. ) The model was discarded and quickly a new model was "built", the now standard [[FRW model]], still within Einstein's theory. That has nicely fitted all data since, with slight adjustments, and so we are fond of it and call it the [[standard model of cosmology]].

This kind of model-building process happens within string theory, too: by iteration the models are being tested, discarded or adjusted, tested again, etc.  

Actually string theory model buidling is more constrained than plain QFT model building, due to the fact that at the heart of it there is _no_ free parameter, since all parameters are instead [[field (physics)|fields]] of the theory, as mentioned before in _[How does string theory make predictions?](#HowDoesStringTheoryMakePredictions)_. So ultimately it gives more, not less reasons to discard a model already on theoretical grounds. There are QFT models which cannot be realized in string theory, because the constraints on the parameters are stronger in string theory, because string theory is not just any old [[effective field theory]] that can be further adjusted as the energy scale is increased, but is already a [[UV-completion]]. It either makes sense at all energies, or not at all. (A practical problem here is that in computations usually lots of approximations are introduced which are not always guaranteed to be viable. For instance nobody really has a good theoretical handle if all the points in the alleged [[landscape of string theory vacua]] really are solutions to the theory. They have all been checked to be so only in some approximation.)

An example of how string theory is more constrained in its model building than effective QFT keeps the community busy since 1998: then it was observed experimentally that the [[cosmological constant]] of the [[observable universe]] these days is small but positive. But accomodating a positive cosmological constant into string theoretic models is harder than negative cosmological constant. So this observation tested a large region of string model building and found it to be wrong. But as for the example of Einstein's "biggest blunder" above, even with all these models ruled out, the theory is still not ruled out (maybe one day with more obserbations it will!) Instead, as in the historical example, the failure of the favorite models lead to new theoretical activity in understanding the theory and its remaining possible models. All this talk about "metastable vacua", etc since in string theory originates in this experimental observation in 1998. 

On the other hand, no other theoretical framework was equally tested by this astronomical observation. In all other existing theoretical frameworks you simply take a pen and change the sign of the cosmological constant by hand. The theory does not control it, it's a free parameter. So it seems justifiable to say that string theory is actually _more testable_ than other existing theoretical frameworks. Of course to appreciate what this means one has to pay attention to what it means to test a theory by testing all its parameter space of models, as illustarted by the Einstein "biggest blunder"-example.

### Does string theory predict supersymmetry? 
 {#DoesSTPredictSupersymmetry}

Superstring _theory_ asserts "[[local supersymmetry]]", namely [[worldsheet]] and [[spacetime]] [[supergravity]]. But any [[model (physics)]] in string theory may or may not retain [[global supersymmetry]] at some energy scale, after [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]].

In fact the generic model has no reason to preserve any 
[[global supersymmetry]] at at, just as the generic solution of [[Einstein's equations]] does not preserve any [[Lorentz group]] symmetry. The condition that a [[Kaluza-Klein compactification]] of 10-dimensional [[supergravity]] to 4d exhibits precisely one global supersymmetry is equivalent to the compatification space being a [[Calabi-Yau manifold]]. While this is a famous condition that has been extensively studied, nothing in the theory requires compatification on CY manifolds. These are (or were) only considered because for _[[phenomenology|phenomenological]]_ reasons
it is (or was) expected that our observed world exhibits global low-energy supersymmetry. 

The role of [[local supersymmetry]] ([[supergravity]]) which superstring theory does predict is quite different from that of low energy global supersymmetry. Notice that as soon as there is a [[fermion]] in the world it follows that [[spacetime]] is described by _[[supergeometry]]_, since fermion field are necessarily formalized by anticommuting functions in the [[Lagrangian]] defining any [[prequantum field theory]] containing them. Now [[supergeometry]] alone does not mean that there is an [[action]] of the [[super Poincaré Lie algebra]] on anything, which is what is called [[supersymmetry]]. 

On the other hand, in low [[worldvolume]] dimension this tends to be inevitable. For instance the [[worldline]] theory of any [[spinning particle]] (such as [[electrons]]) necessarily has worldline supersymmetry, see at _[spinning particle - Worldline supersymmetry](spinning+particle#WorldlineSupersymmetry)_ and at _[spinning particle - Worldline supersymmetry - References](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/spinning+particle#WorldlineSupersymmtryReferences)_.

Similarly, the standard [[sigma-model]] [[worldsheet]] [[action functional]] of the [[spinning string]] was not originally intended to be supersymmetric, but just so happens to come out this way. The special phenomenon as opposed to the superparticle is that the worldsheet supersymmetry of the string _implies_ that its [[second quantization]] [[effective field theory]] is also locally supersymmetric, hence is a [[theory (physics)|theory]] of [[supergravity]].

### How/why does string theory depend on "backgrounds"?
 {#BackgroundDependence}

To answer this question one needs -- as discussed at _[What is string theory?](#WhatIsStringTheory)_ -- to distinguish between _[[perturbative string theory]]_ and _[[non-perturbative string theory]]_.

Perturbative string theory, being a variant of traditional [[perturbation theory]] in [[quantum field theory]], is by construction a perturbation _about a background_, just as any perturbation series is.

To stick with the (close) analogy to [[Taylor series]] mentioned before in _[What is string theory?](#WhatIsStringTheory)_: if the full object of study is a [[smooth function]] on the [[real line]], then a "perturbative" approximation to this by a  [[Taylor series]] involves a choice of point on the real line around which the Taylor series is developed. The series itself represents the original funtion restricted to the [[formal geometry|formal]] neighbourhood of that point. 

This example also serves to illustrate in which sense a perturbation series "depends" on a choice of background: for a given smooth function and for two points on the real line that lie within the [[convergence radius]] of the Taylor series of that function around the respective other point, the expansion does _not_ depend on the "choice of background" in the sense that the value of one series evaluated at a given point equals the value of the other series evaluated at the same point.  The only restriction to this statemet is that some points may ly outside of the convergence radius.

For QFT [[perturbation series]] we have essentially the same situation: the [[correlators]] of the theory are expressed as [[formal power series]] in the [[coupling constants]] of the [[theory (physics)|theory]] and in [[Planck's constant]], which are the [[formal geometry|formal]] approximations to the true non-pertrubative correlators expanded about zero coupling and vanishing Planck's constant. At that 0-point the theory is non-interacting and "classical", meaning that this is the point of a solution to the classical [[equations of motion]] of the non-interacting theory. Such a solution is also called a _[[vacuum]]_ or a _background_ of the quantum theory. Notably in theories containing [[gravity]] (such as string theory), such a background involves a solutions to [[Einstein's equations]], hence involves fixing a [[spacetime]] [[manifold]] on which all further perturbative quantum fields propagate. 

By the above logic, while the specific perturbation series depends on the choice of this classical solution, hence the choice of "background" or of [[vacuum]], this dependency is not a property of the underlying non-perturbative theory but is a defining property of what it means to consider a perturbative approximation. (The subtlety being that for all QFTs of interest the 
[[radius of convergence]] of that formal series is necessarily 0, see the discussion at _[Isn't it fatal that the string perturbatin series does not converge?](#NonConvergenceOfPerturbationSeries)_ )

By design, all this applies also to [[perturbative string theory]].

As mentioned before, there is the idea that perturbative string theory is indeed the pertrubative approximation to an as-yet unknown [[non-perturbative string theory]]. To the extent that this is true, the dependence of the string pertrurbation series on the choice of "background" should be of the same superficial nature as it is for traditional perturbative QFT. But this remains a conjeture. 

Consistency arguments for this speculation have been given in ([Witten xy](#Witten)). A theoretical framework for formalizing these questions is _[[string field theory]]_, in the context of which much of this has been formalized (...). 



### Did string theory provide any insight relevant in experimental particle physics?
 {#InsightInParticlePhysics}

Yes. One curious aspect of string theory is that independently of its role as a source for models in particle physics, it provides connections in the space of all possible quantum field theories: lots of different quantum field theories (many of them highly unrealistic as phenomenology goes, but interesting for theoretical investigations) appear as different limits and special cases inside string theory, and their embedding into a single framework this way explains many unexpected relations between them. One of this has led to recent progress simply in computional tools of perturbation series. LHC physicists claimed that without the insight from string theory, the evaluation software used at the LHC ould not have been precise enough to see the Higgs in the data. 

Details on this are linked to at 

* _[[string theory results applied elsewhere]]_. 

This is maybe the example most directly related to experimental physics, but there are varius other relations ("dualities") between QFTs learned from or better understood with string theory. ([[Seiberg duality]] for instance, long list will go here...)


### Does string theory tell us anything about cosmology, such as the Big bang or cosmic inflation?
 {#InsightsIntoCosmology}

No. Looking back at the answer to _[What is string theory?](#WhatIsStringTheory)_ we have that the only thing really defined is [[perturbative string theory]] -- and quantum [[perturbation theory]] is clearly insufficient for discussion of strongly coupled phenomena such as [[cosmology|cosmological]] phenomena (as opposed to those tiny excitations studied in particle accelerators).

More precisely: given that perturbative string theory does describe classical gravitational backgrounds with small quantum flutuations about them, and given that this is already all that traditional cosmology considers, certainly all of traditional cosmology can sensibly be modeled in string theory. But perturbative string theory cannot say much about the long-expected strong quantum corrections to gravitational effects in [[quantum gravity]]. 

This hasn't stopped people from making lots of speculations, and there is something like a "field" called "string cosmology" in that you find authors writing about this, giving talks and lectures about it. But this is a bit like a soccer match with a pingong ball. 

What would be needed here is an understanding of [[non-perturbative string theory]].

On the other hand, in theories of [[supergravity]] such as string theory, there are some [[observables]] that are independent of the coupling constant (called "protected"): the [[BPS states]]. If one can compute such observables in perturbation theory and then has an idea of what these correspond to as the [[coupling constant]] is set to a finite value, then one can know the value of the corresponding [[observable]] in the [[non-perturbative quantum field theory|non-perturbative theory]] without even knowing that non-perturbative theory itself. This is the mechanism by which perturbative string theory does make statements about [[black hole entropy]], where [[black holes]] by their very nature are strongly coupled gravitational configurations. More on how this works is at _[[black holes in string theory]]_. 

Since the [[singularity]] involved in back holes is a similar kind of singularity as that involved in the [[big bang]] one might think that some analogous method is useful in the latter case. But if so, it has not surfaced so far.

### Isn't it fatal that the string perturbation series does not converge?
 {#NonConvergenceOfPerturbationSeries}

On the contrary, the [[perturbation series]] of any interesting QFT is supposed to have [[radius of convergence]] equal to 0. Because the expansion parameter is the [[coupling constant]] and if the series had a finite radius of convergence, there would be also _negative_ values of the coupling for which the correlators are convergent. See at _[[non-perturbative effect]]_ for more.

So the non-convergence of the string perturbation series is just as it should be in QFT. The important point is rather that the string perturbation series is _termwise_ finite (proven so for [[bosonic string theory]] and the first orders of [[superstring theory]]), which means that it is already [[renormalization|renormalized]]: the higher string modes provide the natural counterterms for the renormalization.
