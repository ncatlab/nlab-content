## What is string theory?
 {WhatIsStringTheory}

What is called _[[perturbative string theory]]_ is a variant of _[[perturbation theory]]_ in _[[quantum field theory]]_ (QFT). 

One way that the latter is defined is as a means to compute [[n-point functions]] in QFT as a [[formal power series]] [[sum|summing]] over labelled [[graphs]] (called _[[Feynman diagrams]]_) of the [[correlators]] of a 1-dimensional QFT defined on these graphs (the _[[worldline]] [[theory]]_ of the [[particles]]/[[virtual particles]] whose scattering amplitude is expressed by the $n$-point function). As a variant of this, the _[[string perturbation series]]_ is defined to be a similar series, but instead of over 1-dimensional graphs now over 2-dimensional [[surfaces]] ("[[worldsheet|worldsheets]]") and instead of summing correlators of a 1d QFT, summing correlators of a 2-dimensional QFT, specifically a 2d [[CFT]].

The premise of _[[perturbative string theory]]_ as a [[theory (physics)|theory]] about the [[observable universe|observable world]] is that fundamental scattering processes such as observed in [[particle accelerator]] experiments and which are to good approximation described by the Feynman perturbation series of the [[standard model of particle physics]] are more accurately described by such a [[string perturbation series]].

More conceptually, the premise is that 

1. the [[standard model of particle physics]] and [[gravity]] is just an [[effective field theory]] (this is generally expected, independently of string theory)

1. that a string perturbation series can provide its [[UV-completion]].


While the string perturbation series is a well-defined expression analogous to the Feynman perturbation series, by itself it lacks a _conceptual_ property of the latter: the Feynman perturbation series is known, in principle, to be the approximation to _something_, namely to the corresponding complete hence [[non-perturbative quantum field theory]]. The idea is that the string perturbation series is similarly the approximation to something, to something which would then be called _[[non-perturbative string theory]]_, but that something has not been identified.

This situation is analogous to the following simple setup: the theory of [[smooth functions]] on the [[real line]] can be approximated by the theory of [[Taylor series]]. Now the notion of Taylor series has some variants, say to the theory of [[species]]. But then the question arises: what is to species as Taylor series were to smooth functions?

There are a host of educated guesses of what non-perturbative string theory might be, if anything, but it remains unknown. At some point the term _[[M-theory]]_ had been established for whatever that non-perturbative theory is, but even though it already has a name, it still remains unknown.

Therefore if the qualification "perturbative"/"non-perturbative" is suppresed, then the term "string theory" is quite ambiguous and has frequently led to misunderstanding. Perturbative string theory is a well defined and formally suggestive variant of established perturbation theory in QFT. Non-Perturbative string theory on the other hand is a hypothetical refinement of this perturbative theory of which there are maybe some hints, but which by and largy remains mysterious, if it exists at all.

## How/why does string theory depend on "backgrounds"?
 {#BackgroundDependence}

As discussed at _[What is string theory?](#WhatIsStringTheory)_ one needs to distinguish between perturbative string theory and non-perturbative string theory.

Perturbative string theory, being a variant of traditional [[perturbation theory]] in [[quantum field theory]] is by construction a perturbation _about a background_, just as any perturbation series is.

To stick with the (close) analogy to [[Taylor series]] mentioned before in [What is string theory?](#WhatIsStringTheory): if the full object of study is a [[smooth function]] on the real line, then a "perturbative" approximation to this by a  [[Taylor series]] involves a choice of point on the real line around which the Taylor series is developed. The series itself represents the original funtion restricted to the [[formal geometry]] formal neighbourhood of that point. 

This example also serves to illustrate in which sense a perturbation series "depends" on choice of background: for a given smooth function and for two points on the real line that lie within the [[convergence radius]] of the Taylor series of that function around the respective other point, the expansion does _not_ depend on the "choice of background" in the sense that the value of one series evaluated at a given point equals the value of the other series evaluated at the same point.  The only restriction to this statemet is that some points may ly outside of the convergence radius.

For QFT [[perturbation series]] we have essentially the same situation: the [[correlators]] of the theory are expressed as [[formal power series]] in the [[coupling constants]] and in [[Planck's constant]] of the true non-pertrubative correlators expanded about zero coupling and vanishing Planck's constant. At that 0-point the theory is non-interacting and "classical", meaning that this is the point of a solution to the classical [[equations of motion]] of the non-interacting theory. 

By the above logic, while the specific perturbation series depends on the choice of this classical solution, hence the choice of "background" or of [[vacuum]], this dependency is not a property of the underlying non-perturbative theory but is a defining property of what it means to consider a perturbative approximation. (The subtlety being that for all QFTs of interest the radius of convergence of that formal series is necessarily 0...)

By design, all this applies also to [[perturbative string theory]].

As mentioned before, there is the idea that perturbative string theory is indeed the pertrubative approximation to an as-yet unknown [[non-perturbative string theory]]. To the extent that this is true, the dependence of the string pertrurbation series on the choice of "background" should be of the same superficial nature as it is for traditional perturbative QFT. But this remains a conjeture. 

Consistency arguments for this speculation have been given in ([Witten xy](#Witten)). A theoretical framework for formalizing these questions is _[[string field theory]]_, in the context of which much of this has been formalized (...). 










## Does string theory make predictions? Is string theory testable?

Most every [[theory (physics)|theory]] and [[model (in theoretical physics)|model]] in [[physics]] has parameters and makes predictions only after sufficiently many parameters have been fixed by measuring them in experiment. 

For instance Newton's theory of [[gravity]] says that the gravitational [[force]] of a pointlike [[mass]] is proportional to inverse square of the distance from that mass This is the theory, the proportionality factor (now called [[Newton's constant]]) is the free parameter that has to be fixed by experiment. 

In string theory as in any other theory of physics, it is the same general principle, only that the theory is much richer. There are lots of of [[model (in theoretical physics)|models]] in string theory that make very detailed statements about the resulting physics. Moreover, many of these have good general agreement with presently observed data (an class of examples is discussed at _[[G2-MSSM]]_), so this is as in traditional model building. 

The remaining problem is the following, and this is not specific to string theory but faced by any theory that provides a [[UV-completion]] of the standard model plus gravity ([[quantum gravity]]): the problem is that after parameters have been fixed this way by finding a model that reproduces the  standard model reasonably accurately, all the remaining properties of the model,  hence the predictions of the model, tend to be at high energies ("[[Planck scale]]") and hence not within reach of of present experiment.

This is a very general aspect of present particle physics: while _theoretically_ it is clear that the standard model must have a UV-completion by _something_, at presently available experimental energies that standard model works rather perfectly. While this is a general fact of particle physics and model building, not special to string theory, a sociological aspect of string theory is that in the 1980s many theoreticians started to believe and claim that string theory would be better than ordinary model building in that when fully understood it would admit only very few models, such that even the parameters measured in the standard model would be predicted by the theory and some more basic parameters. More recently this hope has vanished, and much of what should be an absolute estimate of string theory is more a perception in the negative gradient of this hope curve. 

But one technical specialty of string theory over QFT model building exists in either case: what in the standard model are external parameters put into a QFT [[Lagrangian]], in string theory models are all dynamical fields of the theory instead:

The simple familiar example to compare this to is the [[cosmological constant]] in Einstein gravity: one can either consider it as an external parameter, a constant real number coefficient in front of the [[volume form]] summand of the [[Einstein-Hilbert action|Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian]], or else one can consider Einstein gravity coupled to a [[scalar field]] with some potential and consider those solutions to the [[equations of motion]] where this field is is almost constant to good approximation. Then the field itself serves as an effective cosmological constant. (This is the mechanism behind the theory of _[[cosmic inflation]]_, see there for more details.) Hence the theory has one less external parameter (the "cosmological constant" is not fundamentally really a constant), which has instead been replaced by a [[field (physics)|field]]. 

In string theory this happens with _all_ parameters. There is no external choice of parameter, but there remains the choice of studying "solutions to the equations of motion" (which in string theory means: choices of 2d [[CFT]]s) which might model observed physics. 

That is why in string theory instead of adjusting parameters one searches solutions. Since these are also called "[[vacua]]", one searches vacua. The infamous term "[[landscape of string theory vacua]]" refers to attempts to understand the space of possibilities here more globally. But very little is actually known to date. 

In summary: [[model (in theoretical physics)|models]] built in string theory make predictions just as any other [[model (in theoretical physics)|model]] in theoretical physics does. 
The situation is actually better in that in principle the choice of model in string theory is constrained by the theory. While the [[standard model of particle physics]] is just written to paper, when one reproduces approximations to it in string theory one has to check that various consistency conditions are satisfied which guarantee that the parameters assumed indeed do arise as configurations of the fields in the theory. 

Nevertheless, despite of this higher predictivity in principle, in practice it has not yet lead to much insight that would actually affect particle physics models in practice.


## Did string theory provide any insight that affected recent progress in experimental particle physics, such as the discsovery of the Higgs-boson like particle?

Yes. One curious aspect of string theory is that independently of its role as a source for models in particle physics, it provides connections in the space of all possible quantum field theories: lots of different quantum field theories (many of them highly unrealistic as phenomenology goes, but interesting for theoretical investigations) appear as different limits and special cases inside string theory, and their embedding into a single framework this way explains many unexpected relations between them. One of this has led to recent progress simply in computional tools of perturbation series. LHC physicists claimed that without the insight from string theory, the evaluation software used at the LHC ould not have been precise enough to see the Higgs in the data. Details on this are linked to at [[string theory results applied elsewhere]]. This is maybe the example most directly related to experimental physics, but there are varius other relations ("dualiteis") between QFTs learned from or better understood with string theory. (Seiberg duality for instance, long list will go here...)
