## Idea

Given a [[globally hyperbolic spacetime]], the [[causal propagator]] defines a [[symplectic form]] on the [[covariant phase space]] of the [[free field|free]] [[scalar field]]. However its [[wave front set]] is too large for the would-be induced [[Moyal star product]] to exist on but a very small subalgebra of smooth functionals, due to the failure of the relevant [[products of distributions]] to exist. However the Moyal star product makes sense more generally for [[almost Kähler structures]] with a symmetric contribution added to the skew-symmetric symplectic form. 

A _Hadamard distribution_ is such a modification of the causal propagator by a symmetric component such that the resulting [[wave front set]] is just one causal half of that of the [[causal propagator]]. This allows to define the corresponding [[Moyal star product]] on the larger algebra of [[microcausal functionals]] which is large enough to contain the [[adiabatic switching|adiabatically switched]] point [[interaction]] terms $g \phi(x)^n$ (as in [[phi^4 theory]] etc.). The resulting [[algebra of observables]] is the _[[Wick algebra]]_ of the free scalar field.

The Hadamard distribution may also be thought of as the [[2-point function]] of a [[quasi-free quantum state]]. These states are therefore called _quasi-free Hadamard states_.


## Definition


Recall the following general facts about the [[wave equation]]/[[Klein-Gordon equation]]

+-- {: .num_prop #PropertiesOfTheCausalPropagator}
###### Proposition
**(the causal propagator)**

Let $(X,g)$ be a [[time orientation|time-oriented]] [[globally hyperbolic spacetime]] and let $m \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ (the "[[mass]]"). Then the [[Klein-Gordon equation]]

$$
  (\Box_g - m^2) \phi = 0
$$

(a [[partial differential equation]] on [[smooth functions]] $f \in C^\infty(X,\mathbb{R})$ ) has unique advanced and retarded [[Green functions]] $E^{R/A}$, namely [[continuous linear functionals]]

$$
  E^{A/R} 
   \;\colon\;
  C^\infty_c(X)
   \longrightarrow
  C^\infty(X)
$$

(from [[bump functions]] to general [[smooth functions]]) which are [[fundamental solutions]] in that 

$$
  (\Box_g - m^2) \circ E^{A/R} = \delta
  \phantom{AAAA}
  E^{A/R} \circ (\Box_g - m^2) = \delta
$$

and which have advanced/retarded [[support of a distribution]] when viewed (via the [[Schwartz kernel theorem]]) as [[distributions]] on the [[Cartesian product]] manifold $X \times X$

$$
  supp( E^{A/R}) \subset \{ (x_1, x_2) \in X \times X  \;\vert\; x_1 \in J^{\mp} (x_2) \}
 \,.
$$

In fact these two fundamental solutions are related by switching their arguments 

$$
  E^{A/R}(x_1, x_2) = E^{R/A}(x_2, x_1)
  \,.
$$

Finally their [[wave front set]] is 

$$
  WF(E^{A/R})
  \;=\;
  \left\{
   ((x_1, x_2), (k_1, -k_2))
   \;\vert\;
   x_1 \in J^{\mp}(x_2)
   \;\text{and}\;
   \left(
     (x_1, k_1) \sim (x_2, k_2)
   \right)
   \;\text{or}\;
   \left(
     (x_1 = x_2)
     \,\text{and}\,
     k_1 = -k_2
   \right)
  \right\}
  \,.
$$

Here the [[relation]] $(x_1, k_1) \sim (x_2, k_2)$ means that there exists a [[lightlike]] [[geodesic]] from $x_1$ to $x_2$ with cotangent vector $k_1$ at $x_1$ and $k_2$ at $x_2$.

It follows that the [[wave front set]] of their difference (the [[causal propagator]])

$$
  E \;\coloneqq\; E^A - E^R
$$

is 

$$
  WF(E)
  \;=\;
  \left\{
    ((x_1 x_2), (k_1, -k_2))
    \;\vert\;
    (x_1, k_1) \sim (x_2, k_2)
  \right\}
  \,.
$$

###### Definition
**(Hadamard distribution)

Let $(X,g)$ be a [[time orientation|time oriented]] [[globally hyperbolic spacetime]].

A _Hadamard 2-point function_ or _Hadamard distribution_ for the [[free field|free]] [[scalar field]] on $(X,g)$ is a [[distribution]] 

$$
  \omega \in \mathcal{D}'(X \times X)
$$

on the [[Cartesian product]] manifold such that


1. the anti-symmetric part of $\omega$ is the [[causal propagator]] $E$ (from prop. \ref{PropertiesOfTheCausalPropagator})

   $$
     \omega(x_1, x_2) - \omega(x_2, x_1)
     \;=\;
     i E(x_1, x_2)
   $$

1. (wave front set spectral condition [Radzikowski 96, def. 6.1](#Radzikowski96))

   the [[wave front set]] is one causal half that of the causal propagator:

   $$
     WF(\omega)
     \;=\;
     \left\{
       ((x_1, x_2), (k_1, -k_2))
       \;\vert\;
       (x_1, k_1) \simeq (x_2, k_2)
       \;\;\text{and}\;\;
       k_1 \in V_{x_1}^+
     \right\}
   $$



1. (Klein-Gordon bi-solution) $(\Box_g - m^2) \omega(-,x) = 0$ and $(\Box_g - m^2)\omega(x,-) = 0$, for all $x \in X$;
