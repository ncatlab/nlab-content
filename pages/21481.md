The term _$Diff$_ is often used as a name for one of the following [[categories]]:

* the category of [[smooth manifolds]],

* the category of [[differentiable manifolds]] for some degree of differentiation (which authors may or may not indicate by a subscript),

* the category of [[diffeological spaces]].

Beware that all these categories are different, albeit related.
