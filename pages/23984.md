[[Gottfried Leibniz]] said (in translation from [Lewis 1918, p. 373](#Lewis18) with original Latin terms in parenthesis; see also [Cartwright 1971, p. 119](#Cartwright71) and [Gries & Schneider 1998](#GriesSchneider98))

> Two terms are the same (eadem) if one can be substituted for the otherwithout altering the truth of any statement (salva veritate). If we have $P$ and $Q$, and $P$ enters into some true proposition, and the substitution of $Q$ for $P$ wherever it appears results in a new proposition that is likewise true, and if this can be done for every proposition, then $P$ and $Q$ are said to be the same; conversely, if $P$ and $Q$ are the same, they can be substituted for one another.

The converse mentioned at the end of the last sentence is known as the **principle of substitution** or the **indiscernibility of identicals**. In any simply typed first-order theory, this principle is formalized as 

$$x =_T y \implies \forall \; \mathrm{properties} \; P. P(x) \iff P(y)$$

In the interpretation of [[propositions as types]] in [[type theory]], propositions are interpreted as types, and the above statement has a generalization from the types which are propositions to all types: the [[universal quantifier]] becomes a [[dependent product type]], the [[predicate]] becomes a [[type family]], [[implication]] becomes a [[function]], and [[logical equivalence]] of [[propositions]] becomes [[equivalence in homotopy type theory|equivalence of types]]. This results in what is known as *transport* in type theory, the function 

$$\mathrm{transport}(x, y): x =_T y \to \prod_{P:T \to \mathcal{U}} P(x) \simeq P(y)$$

## Definitions

### Martin-Löf type theory

In [[Martin-Löf type theory]], given 

* a [[type]] $A$, 

* a [[judgment]] $z \colon A \vdash B(z)\ \mathrm{type}$ (hence an $A$-[[dependent type]] $B$), 

* [[terms]]$\,$ $x \colon A$ and $y \colon A$, 

* an [[term]] of their [[identity type]] $p \colon (x =_A y)$, 

then there are compatible **transport functions** 

\[
  \label{TheTransportFunctions}
  \overrightarrow{\mathrm{tr}}_{B}^{p}
  \,\colon\, 
  B(x) \longrightarrow B(y) 
  \;\;\;
  \text{and}
  \;\;\;
  \overleftarrow{\mathrm{tr}}_{B}^{p}
  \,\colon\, B(y) \longrightarrow B(x)
  \,,
\] 

such that for all $v:B(y)$, the ([[homotopy fiber|homotopy]]) [[fiber]] of $\overrightarrow{\mathrm{tr}}_{B}^{p}$ at $v$ is [[contractible]], and for all $u:B(x)$, the [[fiber]] of $\overleftarrow{\mathrm{tr}}_{B}^{p}$ at $u$ is [[contractible]].

## Examples and applications

\begin{remark}\label{RelationToParallelTransport}
**(relation to parallel transport -- [[schreiber:differential cohomology in a cohesive topos|dcct §3.8.5]], [ScSh12 §3.1.2](cohesive+homotopy+type+theory#SchreiberShulman2012))**
\linebreak
  In [[cohesive homotopy type theory]] the [[shape modality]] $\esh$ has the [[shape via cohesive path ∞-groupoid|interpretation]] of turning any cohesive type $X$ into its [[path infinity-groupoid|path $\infty$-groupoid]] $\esh X$: The [[1-morphisms]] $p \colon (x =_{\esh X} y)$ of $\esh X$ have the [[shape via cohesive path ∞-groupoid|interpretation]] of being (whatever identities existed in $X$ composed with) cohesive (e.g. [[continuous function|continuous]] or [[smooth function|smooth]]) *[[paths]]* in $X$, and similarly for the higher order paths-of-paths.

Accordingly, an [[shape modality|$\esh X$]]-[[dependent type]] $B$ has the interpretation of being a "[[local system]]" of $B$-[[coefficients]] over $X$, namely a $B(x)$-[[fiber infinity-bundle|fiber $\infty$-bundle]] equipped with a [[flat infinity-connection|flat $\infty$-connection]]. 

In this case, the identity transport (eq:TheTransportFunctions) along paths in [[shape modality|$\esh X$]] has the interpretation of being the *[[parallel transport]]* (in the original sense of [[differential geometry]]) with respect to this [[flat infinity-connection|flat $\infty$-connection]] (and the [[higher parallel transport]] when applied to paths-of-paths).
