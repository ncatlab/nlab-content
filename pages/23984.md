## Idea ##
 {#Idea}

In [[Martin-Löf type theory]], given 

* a [[type]] $A$, 

* a [[judgment]] $z \colon A \vdash B(z)\ \mathrm{type}$ (hence $B$ an $A$-[[dependent type]]), 

* [[terms]] $x \colon A$ and $y \colon A$, 

* an [[term]] of their [[identity type]] $p \colon (x =_A y)$, 

then there are compatible **transport functions** 

$$
  \overrightarrow{\mathrm{tr}}_{B}^{p}:B(x) \to B(y) 
  \;\;\;
  \text{and}
  \;\;\;
  \overleftarrow{\mathrm{tr}}_{B}^{p}:B(y) \to B(x)
  \,,
$$ 

such that for all $v:B(y)$, the [[fiber]] of $\overrightarrow{\mathrm{tr}}_{B}^{p}$ at $v$ is [[contractible]], and for all $u:B(x)$, the [[fiber]] of $\overleftarrow{\mathrm{tr}}_{B}^{p}$ at $u$ is [[contractible]]. 

## Examples and applications

\begin{remark}\label{RelationToParallelTransport}
**(relation to parallel transport -- [[schreiber:differential cohomology in a cohesive topos|dcct §3.8.5]]; [ScSh12, §3.1.2](cohesive+homotopy+type+theory#SchreiberShulman2012))**
\linebreak
  In [[cohesive homotopy type theory]] the [[shape modality]] $\esh$ has the [[shape via cohesive path ∞-groupoid|interpretation]] of turning any cohesive type $X$ into its [[path infinity-groupoid|path $\infty$-groupoid]] $\esh X$: The [[1-morphisms]] $p \colon (x =_{\esh X} y)$ of $\esh X$ have the [[shape via cohesive path ∞-groupoid|interpretation]] of being (whatever identities existed in $X$ composed with) cohesive (e.g. [[continuous function|continuous]] or [[smooth function|smooth]]) *[[paths]]* in $X$, and similarly for the higher order paths-of-paths.

Accordingly, an $\esh X$-dependent type $B$ has the interpretation of being a "[[local system]]" of $B$-coefficients over $X$, namely a $B(x)$-[[fiber infinity-bundle|fiber $\infty$-bundle]] equipped with a [[flat infinity-connection|flat $\infty$-connection]]. 

In this case, the identity transport along paths in $\esh X$ has the interpretation of being the *[[parallel transport]]* (in the original sense of [[differential geometry]]) with respect to this flat connection (and the [[higher parallel transport]] when applied to paths-of-paths).
