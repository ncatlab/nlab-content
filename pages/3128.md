## Definition

A **copresheaf** on a [[category]] $C$ is a [[presheaf]] on the [[opposite category]] $C^{op}$. 

In other words, a co-presheaf on $C$ is just a [[functor]] on $C$. One speaks of functors as co-presheafs if one wants to impose a gluing condition on them and pass to _[[cosheaves]]_.
