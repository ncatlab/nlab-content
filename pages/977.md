There are two different notions of a dense subcategory:

1. a subcategory $D\subset C$ is __dense__ if every object in $C$ is canonically a colimit of objects in $D$.  This is equivalent to saying that the inclusion $D\hookrightarrow C$ is a [[dense functor]].  See also the relevant section of [[Categories Work]] and the entries on [[nerve]], [[geometric realization]] and [[singular functor]].  An older name for a dense subcategory in this sense is an *adequate* subcategory.

2. a subcategory $D\subset C$ is __dense__ if every object $c$ of $C$ has a $D$-expansion, that is a morphism $c\to\bar{c}$ of [[pro-object]]s in $D$ which is universal among all morphisms of pro-objects in $D$ with source $c$. This second notion is used in [[shape theory]]. An alternative name for this is a [[pro-reflective subcategory]], that is a subcategory for which the inclusion has a [[proadjoint]].
