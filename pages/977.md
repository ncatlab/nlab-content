## Definition

There are two different notions of _dense [[subcategory]]_ $D$ of a given [[category]] $C$:

1. A subcategory $D\subset C$ is __dense__ if every [[object]] in $C$ is canonically a [[colimit]] of objects in $D$.  

   This is equivalent to saying that the inclusion [[functor]] $D\hookrightarrow C$ is a [[dense functor]].  

   An older name for a dense subcategory in this sense is an **adequate subcategory**.

2. A subcategory $D\subset C$ is __dense__ if every object $c$ of $C$ has a $D$-expansion, that is a [[morphism]] $c\to\bar{c}$ of [[pro-objects]] in $D$ which is [[universal property|universal]] ([[initial object|initial]]) among all morphisms of pro-objects in $D$ with [[domain]] $c$. 

   This second notion is used in [[shape theory]]. An alternative name for this is a **pro-reflective subcategory**, that is a subcategory for which the inclusion has a [[proadjoint]].

## Applications

* A [[dense functor]] $S \hookrightarrow C$ into a [[locally small category]] $C$ induces a good notion of [[nerve]] $N : C \to [S^{op}, Set]$ of objects in $C$ with values in the [[presheaves]] on $S$. See [[nerve]] and [[nerve and realization]] for more on this.
