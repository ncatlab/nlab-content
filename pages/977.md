There are two different notions of a dense subcategory:

1. a subcategory $D\subset C$ is dense if every object in $C$ is canonically a colimit of objects in $D$; see more the entry for more general notion [[dense functor]] for more details (or better, a section of S. MacLane's book Categories for working mathematician) and for the equivalent notion of (Isbell) adequate subcategory which is used in connection to the notions of [[nerve]], [[geometric realization]] and [[singular functor]].

2. a subcategory $D\subset C$ is dense if every object $c$ 
of $C$ has a $D$-expansion, that is a morphism $c\to\bar{c}$ of pro-objects in $D$ which is universal among all morphisms of pro-objects in $D$ with source $c$. This second notion is used in [[shape theory]].
