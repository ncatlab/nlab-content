## Idea

The _neutrino_ is one of the fundamental [[particles]]/[[matter]] [[field (physics)|fields]] in the [[standard model of particle physics]].


## History

The history of the prediction of the neutrino is interesting and may (or may not) contain some general lessons for theoretical physics/[[mathematical physics]].

Before 1930 [[experiments]] detected an apparent violation of the [[conservation law]] for [[energy]] in processes of [[beta decay]]. 

Back then [[Niels Bohr]] proposed that, therefore, appearently the fundamental [[conservation laws]] in [[physics]] may be violated and possibly only hold [[probability theory|statistically]] over many quantum mechanical processes, but possibly not microscopically.

Opposed to this was the suggestion by [[Wolfgang Pauli]], who insisted that the [[conservation laws]] ought to hold true, and that therefore there must be an undetected new [[fundamental particle]] created in [[beta decay]], which does carry the apparently missing [[energy]].

Pauli with his argument and suggestion turned out to be right. The missing particle -- called the _neutrino_ by [[Enrico Fermi]] in 1933 -- was finally directly detected in 1956, hence 26 years after its proposal.

Notice that back then, predicting unobserved and possibly practically unobservable [[fundamental particles]] was not taken as lightly as in some circles it is these days (e.g. in [[supersymmetry]] and/or [[string theory]]). In ([AP 06, p. 7](#AP06)) Pauli is quoted on this as having said:

> I’ve done a terrible thing today, something which no theoretical physicist should ever do. I have suggested something that can never be verified experimentally.

But concerning the motivation for this predictions, notice that back around 1915 [[Emmy Noether]] had proven the theorem now named after her -- [[Noether's theorem|Noether's first theorem]] -- which asserts that [[symmetries]] of [[equations of motion]] in [[physics]] correspond to [[conservation laws]]. In particular if a system (notably the [[forces]] and [[interactions]] of [[fundamental particles]]) does not change over [[time]], then [[Noether's theorem|Noether's first theorem]] asserts that the [[energy]] of the system must be conserved.
The theorem applies as soon as the [[physics]] is described by a [[local Lagrangian]]/[[local action functional]] and the [[principle of extremal action]]. This was in principle well established in 1930, even though maybe not as widely appreciated as it could have been. The generalization of this to [[quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum field theory]] was maybe fully understood only later.

But in view of this theorem, Bohr's suggestion that energy conservation fails would have implied that fundamental physics is not governed by an [[action principle]], something arguably more dramatic than some violation of some energy conservation might seem.

Today Pauli is widely acknowledged for holding up the conservation laws against Bohr's proposal, see for instance ([AP 06, p. 6](#AP06)), where it says:

> Pauli's belief in the absolute credibility of symmetry principles led him to defend conservation laws even when at that time the empirical evidence was doubtful. His prediction of the neutrino is a great example.

But on the other hand, it seems that Pauli's respect for the conservation laws was not informed my Noether's theorem, but rested more on an intuitive feeling, for in ([AP 06, p.5](#AP06)) Pauli is quoted as late as 1953 thus:

> I am very much in favour of the general principle to bring empirical conservation laws and invariance properties in connection with mathematical groups of transformations of the laws of nature.

While this does support the correct answer, this seems to be a rather weak way of stating it, given that Noether's theorem establishes this "connection" as a theorem, and already back in 1915.

Similarly, in ([AP 06, p. 6](#AP06)) Pauli is quoted as reacting to Bohr's propsal by saying:

> I am myself fairly convinced $[...]$ that Bohr with his corresponding deliberations concerning a violation of energy conservation is entirely on the wrong track! $[...]$ The idea of a violation of the conservation of energy in β-decay is and remains, in my opinion, cheap and very clumsy philosophy.

If Pauli had really been relying on symmetry and the Noether theorem, he could have said "provably wrong" instead of just "cheap and clumsy". Especially since "clumsy" suggests "possible, even if not enjoyable", where in fact it is impossible unless the whole foundations of physics are changed.
