$Pos$ is the [[category]] whose [[objects]] are [[posets]] and whose [[morphisms]] are monotone (weakly increasing) maps.

The [[hom-sets]] of $Pos$ themselves have the structure of posets, making $Pos$ into a [[2-poset]] (aka $(1,2)$-category) or [[locally posetal 2-category]].  If [[Set]] is the primordial example of a [[category]] and [[Cat]] is the primordial example of a [[2-category]], then $Pos$ is the primordial example of a $2$-poset.
