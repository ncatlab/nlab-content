# Idea #

Under rather general conditions a functor

$$
  S_C : S \to C
$$

into a [[category]] (or $V$-[[enriched category]] with $V$ asome [[symmetric monoidal category]] with [[limit]]s) $C$ with [[colimit]]s induces a pair of [[adjoint functor]]s

$$
  N : C \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\to} [S^{op}, V] : |-|
$$

where 

* $N$ behaves like a [[nerve]] operation;

* $|-|$ behaves like [[geometric realization]].

**Remark** Here "$S$" is supposed to be suggestive of a category of certain "[[geometric shapes for higher structures|geometric Shapes]]".  The canonical example is $S = \Delta$, the [[simplex category]], and the reader may find it helpful to keep that example in mind.


# Definition #

We place ourselves in the context of $V$-[[enriched category theory]]. The reader wishing to stick to the ordinary notions in [[locally small category|locally small categories]] takes $V$= [[Set]].

The _realization_ operation is the left [[Kan extension]] of $S_C : S \to C$ along the [[Yoneda embedding]] $S \hookrightarrow [S^{op},V]$:

$$
  \array{
    S &\stackrel{S_C}{\to}&& C
    \\
    \downarrow^{Y} &\Downarrow& \nearrow_{|-|}
    \\
    [S^{op},V]
  }
  \,.
$$

If we assume that $C$ is [[copower|tensored]] over $V$, then by the general [[coend]] formula for left [[Kan extension]] we find that for $X \in [S^{op}, V]$ we have

$$
  |X| \simeq 
   \int^{s \in S}
   S_C(s) \cdot X_s
  \,.
$$

For instance when $S = \Delta$ is the [[simplex category]] this reads more recognizably

$$
  |X| \simeq 
   \int^{[n] \in \Delta}
   \Delta_C[n] \cdot X_n
  \,.
$$

The corresponding [[nerve]] operation

$$
  N :
  C \stackrel{}{\to} [S^{op},V]
$$

is given by 

$$
  N(c) : S^{op} \stackrel{S_C^{op}}{\to} C^{op}
  \stackrel{C(-,c)}{\to}  
  V
  \,.
$$

with $N$ [[right adjoint]].

###### Proof

Using the fact that the Hom in its first argument
sends [[coend]]s to [[end]]s
and then using the definition of [[copower|tensoring]]
over $V$, we check
the hom-isomorphism

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    Hom_C(|X|, c)
    &:=
    Hom_C( \int^{s} S_C(s) \cdot X_a, c)
    \\
    & \simeq
    \int_{s} Hom_C( S_C(s) \cdot X_s, c)
    \\
    & \simeq
    \int_{s} Hom_C( X_s , C(S_C(s), c))
    \\
    & =:
    \int_{s} Hom_C( X_s , N(c)_s)
    \\
    & \simeq
    Hom_{[S^{op},V]}(X, N(c))
    \,,
  \end{aligned}
$$

where in the last step we used the definition of the
[[enriched functor category]] in terms of an [[end]].

#Remarks#

* In many cases we have $V = Set$ and the [[copower|tensoring]] of an object $c$ over a set $I$ is given by coproducts as
  $$  
    c \cdot I = \coprod_{i \in I} c
    \,.
  $$
  This is the case for instance for the below examples of realization of simplicial sets, nerves of categories and the Dold-Kan correspondence.

# Examples #

## Topological realization of simplicial sets ##

A classical examples is given by the [[simplicial object|cosimplicial]] [[topological space]]
  $$
    \Delta_{Top} : \Delta \to Top
  $$
  that sends the abstract $n$-simplex $[n]$ to the standard topological $n$-simplex $\Delta_{Top}[n] \subset \mathbb{R}^n$.
  
* The corresponding realization is [[geometric realization]];

* The corresponding [[nerve]] is the [[singular simplicial complex]] of [[infinity-groupoid]] functor.


## Nerve of categories ##

Pretty much every notion of [[category]] and [[higher category theory|higher category]] comes, or should come, with its notion of simplicial nerve, induced from a functor
  $$
    \Delta_C : \Delta \to n Cat
  $$
  that sends the standard $n$-[[simplex]] to something like the free $n$-category on the $n$-[[directed graph]] underlying that simplex.
  One formalization of this for $n = \infty$ in the context of [[strict omega-category|strict omega-categories]] is the cosimplicial $\omega$-category called the [[oriental]]s
  $$
    \Delta_{\omega} : \Delta \to \omega Cat
    \,.
  $$

* The induced [[nerve]] is the [[omega-nerve]].

* The induced realization operation is the operation of forming the free $\omega$-category on a simplicial set. See [[oriental]] for more details.


## Dold-Kan correspondence ##

The [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] is the nerve/realization adjunction for the [[homology]] functor
  $$
    \Delta_{C_\bullet} : \Delta \to Ch_+
  $$
  to the [[category of chain complexes]] of abelian groups, which sends the standard $n$-[[simplex]] to its [[homology]] chain complex, more precisely to its normalized [[Moore complex]].

* The induced realization is the normalized [[Moore complex]] functor extended from $\Delta$ to all [[simplicial set]]s.

# References #

The notion of nerve and realization (not with these names yes) was introduced and proven to be an [[adjunction]] in section 3 of

* [[Daniel Kan]], _Functors involving c.s.s complexes_, Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, Vol. 87, No. 2 (Mar., 1958), pp. 330-346 ([jstor](http://www.jstor.org/stable/1993103)).

In that article, as an example of the general mechanism, also the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] was found and discussed, independently of the work by Dold and Puppe shortly before, who used a much less general-nonsense approach.
