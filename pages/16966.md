## Idea


A _fixed point_ of an [[endofunction]] $f \colon X \to X$ is an $x\in X$ which is taken by $f$ to itself: $f(x) = x$.

## Generalizations

In [[homotopy theory]] this generalizes to the concept of

* [[homotopy fixed point]]

In [[category theory]] this generalizes to the concept of

* [[fixed point of an endofunctor]]

* [[fixed point of an adjunction]]

In [[logic]] one has

* [[fixed-point combinator]]

* [[Lawvere's fixed point theorem]]
