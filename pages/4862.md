## Idea

The **circle** is a fantastic thing with lots and lots of [[stuff, structure, property|properties and extra structures]].  It is a:

* [[topological space]]
* [[smooth manifold]]
* [[Lie group]] (the [[circle group]])
* [[co-H-group]]

and it is one of the basic building blocks for lots of areas of mathematics, including:

* [[homotopy theory]]
* [[loop spaces]]
* [[knots]] and [[links]]


## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn #circle}
###### Definition
The two most common definitions of the circle are:

1. It is the subspace of $\mathbb{C}$ consisting of those numbers of length $1$:

   $$
   U(1) \coloneqq \{z \in \mathbb{C} : |z| = 1\}
   $$

   (of course, $\mathbb{C}$ can be identified with $\mathbb{R}^2$ and an equivalent formulation of this definition given; also, to emphasise the reason for the notation $U(1)$, $\mathbb{C}$ can be replaced by $\mathbb{C}^* = GL_1(\mathbb{C})$)

2. It is the quotient of $\mathbb{R}$ by the integers:

   $$
   S^1 \coloneqq \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}
   $$

The standard equivalence of the two definitions is given by the map $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{C}$, $t \mapsto e^{2 \pi i t}$.


## Properties

The circle is a [[compact space|compact]], [[connected space|connected]] [[topological space]].  It is a $1$-[[dimension|dimensional]] [[smooth manifold]] (indeed, it is the only $1$-dimensional compact, connected smooth manifold).  It is **not** [[simply connected space|simply connected]].
