## Idea

The **circle** is a fantastic thing with lots and lots of [[stuff, structure, property|properties and extra structures]].  It is a:

* [[topological space]]
* [[smooth manifold]]
* [[Lie group]] (the [[circle group]])
* [[co-H-group]]

and it is one of the basic building blocks for lots of areas of mathematics, including:

* [[homotopy theory]]
* [[loop spaces]]
* [[knots]] and [[links]]


## Definition

We consider the circle first as a [[topological space]], then as the [[homotopy type]] represented by that space.

### As a topological space

+-- {: .num_defn #circle}
###### Definition
The two most common definitions of the circle are:

1. It is the subspace of $\mathbb{C}$ consisting of those numbers of length $1$:

   $$
   U(1) \coloneqq \{z \in \mathbb{C} : {|z|} = 1\}
   $$

   (of course, $\mathbb{C}$ can be identified with $\mathbb{R}^2$ and an equivalent formulation of this definition given; also, to emphasise the reason for the notation $U(1)$, $\mathbb{C}$ can be replaced by $\mathbb{C}^* = GL_1(\mathbb{C})$)

2. It is the quotient of $\mathbb{R}$ by the integers:

   $$
   S^1 \coloneqq \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}
   $$
=--

The standard equivalence of the two definitions is given by the map $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{C}$, $t \mapsto e^{2 \pi i t}$.

### As a homotopy type

As a [[homotopy type]] the circle is for instance the [[homotopy pushout]]

$$
  S^1 \simeq * \coprod_{* \coprod * } * 
  \,.
$$

In [[homotopy type theory]], this can be formalized as a [[higher inductive type]] generated by a point `base` and a path from `base` to itself; see the references.

## Properties

The topological circle is a [[compact space|compact]], [[connected space|connected]] [[topological space]].  It is a $1$-[[dimension|dimensional]] [[smooth manifold]] (indeed, it is the only $1$-dimensional compact, connected smooth manifold).  It is **not** [[simply connected space|simply connected]]. 

The circle is a model for the [[classifying space]] for the [[abelian group]] $\mathbb{Z}$, the [[integer]]s. Equivalently, the circle is the [[Eilenberg-Mac Lane space]] $K({\mathbb{Z}},1)$. Equivalently, the loop space of the circle is the free group on one generator. (A proof of this in [[homotopy type theory]] is in [Shulman P1S1](#ShulmanP1S1).) This fact encodes all (except the zeroth) the [[homotopy group]]s of the circle. Explicitly, the first [[homotopy group]] $\pi_1(S^1)$ is the [[integer]]s $\mathbb{Z}$. But the higher [[homotopy groups]] $\pi_n(S^1) \simeq *$, $n \gt 1$ all vanish (and so is a [[homotopy type|homotopy 1-type]]). 

The [[product]] of the circle with itself is the ($2$)-[[torus]]

$$
  T = S^1 \times S^1
  \,.
$$

Generally, the $n$-torus $T^n$ is $(S^1)^n$.
