## Idea

Extra axioms on a [[monoidal model category]] $\mathbf{S}$ that guarantee a particularly good [[homotopy theory]] of $\mathbf{S}$-[[enriched categories]] are referred to as _excellent model category_ structure ([Lurie](#Lurie)).

## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

Let $\mathbf{S}$ be a [[monoidal model category]]. It is called _excellent_ if

* it is a [[combinatorial model category]];

* every monomorphism if a cofibration 

* the collection of cofibrations is closed under [[products]];

* it satisfies the **invertibility hypothesis**: inverting a morphism in an $\mathbf{S}$-[[enriched category]] does not change the homotopy type if the morphism was already a [[homotopy equivalence]] (...).

=--

This is ([Lurie, def. A.3.2.16](#Lurie)).
