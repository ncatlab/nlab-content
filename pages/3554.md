In the original form of [[shape theory|abstract shape theory]], the restrictions that (i) it should refer to a _subcategory_ of 'nice' or 'good' objects, and (ii) that subcategory should be [[dense subcategory|dense]] were unnecessarily restrictive and tended to obscure the nature of certain of the results, which were more general than was initially apparent.

This was explored by Deleanu and Hilton in the early 1970s. 

## Definition## 
Let $K : D\to C$ be a functor. The shape category of $K$ is the category with objects the same objects as those of $C$ but with morphisms from $c$ to $c^\prime$ being the functors between the corresponding [[comma categories]] $(c^\prime)/K)$ and $(c/K)$ (note reversal of order) that are compatible with the codomain functors to $D$.
