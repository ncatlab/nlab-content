## Idea

The _cellular simplex_ is one of the basic [[geometric shapes for higher structures]]. 

## Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the standard _simplicial $n$-simplex_ is the [[simplicial set]] which is represented (as a [[presheaf]]) by the object $[n]$ in the [[simplex category]].

Likewise, there is a standard toplogical $n$-simplex, which is (more or less by definition) the [[geometric realization]] of the standard simplicial $n$-simplex.

## Properties

### Relation to globes

The [[orientals]] related simplices to [[globes]].
