## Idea

The _cellular simplex_ is one of the basic [[geometric shapes for higher structures]]. 

## Definition
 {#Definition}

### Cellular (simplicial) simplex
 {#CellularSimplex}

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the standard _simplicial $n$-simplex_ is the [[simplicial set]] which is represented (as a [[presheaf]]) by the object $[n]$ in the [[simplex category]].

Likewise, there is a standard toplogical $n$-simplex, which is (more or less by definition) the [[geometric realization]] of the standard simplicial $n$-simplex.

### Topological simplex

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

The standard **topological $n$-simplex** is, up to [[homeomorphism]], 
the [[subset]]

$$
  \Delta^n 
  \coloneqq
  \{
     \vec x \in \mathbb{R}^n | 0 \leq x_1 \leq \cdots \leq x_n \leq 1
  \}
  \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^n 
$$

equipped with the [[subspace topology]] of the canonincal topology on the [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$.

### Singular simplex
 {#SingularSimplex}

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For $X \in $ [[nLab:Top]]  and $n \in \mathbb{N}$, a **singular $n$-simplex** in $X$ is a [[nLab:continuous map]]

$$
  \sigma : \Delta^n \to X
  \,.
$$

Write 

$$
  (Sing X)_n \coloneqq Hom_{Top}(\Delta^n , X)
$$ 

for the set of singular $n$-simplices of $X$.

=--

As $n$ varies, this forms the [[singular simplicial complex]] of $X$.

## Properties

### Relation to globes

The [[orientals]] related simplices to [[globes]].
