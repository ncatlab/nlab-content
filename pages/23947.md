Elements of Mathematics (French: Éléments de mathématique)
is a series of books by [[Nicolas Bourbaki]].

It is named after [[Euclid]]'s _Elements_ (Στοιχεῖα).

Most of these books were quite influential, some of them especially so.

In particular, Bourbaki's presentation of [[multilinear algebra]] in Chapter III of the second book (Algèbre) was the first detailed expository presentation of the [[Grassmann algebra]].

Another influential book was _Groupes et algèbres de Lie_, its presentation of [[root systems]] and related topics in Chapter 4–6 was the first of its kind.

Some criticisms raised against this series:

* Almost complete absence of [[categories]] (a deliberate choice);

* _Théorie des ensembles_ receives a lot of criticism for its somewhat nonstandard treatment of logic, as well as the rather awkward notion of a _structure_, which occupies a similar niche to categories.

* The use of Daniell's approach in _Intégration_, mostly ignoring abstract [[measure spaces]].

* Chapter 10 of _Algèbre_ ([[homological algebra]]) only covers the very classical results, (intentionally) ignoring derived categories.
