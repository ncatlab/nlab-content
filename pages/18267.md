## Idea
Model completeness is a [[property]] of [[first-order theories]] (in the same way that [[existential closedness]] is a [[property]] of [[first-order structures]]) meant to generalize the properties of the theory [[ACF]] of [[algebraically closed fields]].

As discussed in Hodges' [Model theory](#Hodges1993):

> In the early 1950s [[Abraham Robinson]] noticed that certain maps studied by algebraists are in fact [[elementary embeddings]]. If you choose a map at random, the chances of it being an elementary embedding are negligible. So Robinson reckoned that there must be a systematic reason for the appearance of these elementary embeddings, and he set out to find what the reason was.

> In the course of this quest he introduced the notions of model complete theories, companionable theories and [[model companion|model companions]]. These notions have become essential tools for the model theory of algebra.

## Definition

We say a [[first-order theory]] $T$ is *model complete* if every embedding (not necessarily elementary) between models of $T$ _is_ elementary.

The following characterization appears as Theorem 8.3.1 in ([Hodges93](#Hodges1993)):

###### Theorem

Let $T$ be as above. The following are equivalent:

1. $T$ is model complete.

2. Every model of $T$ is [[existentially closed model|existentially closed]].

3. For every embedding $A \hookrightarrow B$ where $A$ and $B$ model $T$, there exists an [[elementary extension]] $D$ of $A$ and an embedding $g : B \to D$ such that the triangle commutes.

4. Every [[existentially closed model|existential formula]] is equivalent (mod $T$) to a [[existentially closed model|universal formula]].

5. Every formula is equivalent (mod $T$) to a universal formula.

## Examples

* Since [[quantifier elimination]] is equivalent to [[substructure completeness]], which is stronger than model completeness, every theory which eliminates quantifiers is model complete. So, for example, [[ACF]], [[DLO]], [[RCF]], and the theory of the [[countable random graph]] are all model complete (and so their models are [[existentially closed]].)

## Remarks

* A theory $T$ is model complete if and only if for every _model_ $A$ of $T$, the [[quantifier-free diagram]] $T_{\mathsf{Diag}(A)}$ (whose models are precisely the models of $T$ containing $A$ as an embedded substructure) is _complete_.

* Analogously, a theory $T$ is [[substructure complete]] if and only if for every model $A$ of $T$ and every _substructure_ $B \subseteq A$, the [[quantifier-free diagram]] $T_{\mathsf{Diag}(B)}$ is _complete_.

* A model complete theory is an "existentially closed theory" in the sense that all of its models are [[existentially closed model|existentially closed models]].
