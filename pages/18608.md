## Idea

The _mass gap problem_ is an open conceptual problem in the [[quantization of Yang-Mills theory]], closely related to what in the [[phenomenology]] of [[quantum chromodynamics]] is called the _[[confinement]]_ of [[quarks]], hence the existence of ordinary [[hadron|hadronic]], in particular [[baryon|baryonic]] [[matter]].

The [[Lagrangian]] for [[Yang-Mills theory]] coupled to [[fermion fields]] (such as for [[QCD]]) makes manifest the existence of [[mass]]-less [[quarks]] and [[gluons]]. Indeed, at very high [[temperature]] [[QCD]] is thought to exhibit a [[quark-gluon plasma]] well described by these degrees of freedoms.

But at comparatively smaller [[temperature]] it is observed in [[experiment]] as well as in [[lattice QCD]] computer experiment that QCD exhibits _[[confinement]]_, meaning that the low energy states of the theory are not free massless quarks and gluons anymore, but that these form [[bound states]] in the form of [[hadrons]] (including, notably, [[protons]] and [[neutrons]], and hence all the ordinary [[baryon|baryonic]] [[matter]] of the [[observable universe]]). 

The existence of massive [[hadron]]-[[bound states]] in low-energy [[QCD]] is thus well-established [[phenomenology|phenomenologically]], but it is as yet lacking a conceptual theoretical explanation.

The _mass gap problem_ is the problem in [[mathematical physics]] to demonstrate theoretically (i.e. not just by [[lattice QCD|computer simulation]]) the existence of this mass gap/[[confinement]]-phenomenon in [[QCD]] and in [[Yang-Mills theory]] coupled to [[fermion fields]] in general.

This issue is well and widely known in the [[particle physics]]-community, see for instance [Kutschke 96, Section 3.1](#Kutschke96), [INFN 15](#INFN15). It gained more attention among the [[mathematics]]/[[mathematical physics]]-community when the [Clay Mathematics Institute](http://www.claymath.org/) declared the problem to be one in a list of "[Millennium Problems](http://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems)", see [Jaffe-Witten](#JaffeWitten), [Douglas 04](#Douglas04).

### In the nuclear physics literature
{#ExplicitMentioningInPhysicsLiterature} 

In the [[nuclear physics]]/[[QCD]]-literature the mass gap problem is (and has long been) known as the _[confinement problem](confinement#OpenProblemConfinementReferences)_.

### Approaches

Of course various partial approaches exist, notably computer-[[experiment]] in [[lattice QCD]]. (Such computer-checks of the mass-gap problem are analogous to computer checks of the [[Riemann hypothesis]], see [there](Riemann+hypothesis#ReferencesComputerChecks))

> Still after many decades of vigorous studies the outstanding challenge of modern physics
is to establish a rigorous link of QCD to low-energy hadron physics as it is observed in
the many experimental cross section measurements.
