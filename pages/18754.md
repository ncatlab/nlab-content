## Idea

In [[harmonic analysis]]a _dispersion relation_ is a relation between the [[frequency]] and the [[wavelength]] of [[plane waves]]. Typically this relation expresses the frequency $\nu(\lambda)$ as a [[function]] of the [[wavelength]].

In [[special relativity]] the [[frequency]] of a [[plane wave]] is proportional to its [[energy]], and its [[wave vector]] is proportional to its [[momentum]], so that now a dispersion relation becomes an _energy-momentum relation_.
