## Idea

_Proof nets_ are a graphical way to denote [[proofs]] in [[linear logic]].

Bearing in mind the [[categorical semantics]] of (multiplicative intuitionistic) [[linear logic]] in [[monoidal categories]], proof nets are closely related to [[Kelly-Mac Lane graphs]] that are used to track compositions of extranatural transformations definable in such categorical structures. More generally they may be compared to [[string diagrams]] that are evaluated in these categories. 
Proof nets for full linear logic have been thus described by [Melliès 06](#Mellies06) as string diagrams equipped with "boxes" to account for the [[exponential modality]]. 

With [[linear logic]]/[[linear type theory]] interpreted as [[quantum logic]]/[[quantum computation]], proof nets correspond to [[quantum circuits]] or [[Feynman diagrams]] ([Blute Panangaden](#BlutePanangaden)).

## Definition 

We begin by describing proof nets for multiplicative linear logic (MLL), which is interpretable in $\ast$-[[star-autonomous category|autonomous]] categories. Similar proof nets may be given for other forms of [[linear type theory]] such as multiplicative intuitionistic linear logic, which is interpretable in [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]] [[closed monoidal categories]]. 

### Proof structures 

Before describing proof nets, we start with Girard's notion of _proof structure_. It is simplest to describe the cut-free version, as this is closely connected with the notion of [[Kelly-Mac Lane graph]], or KM-graph for short. We need just a few preliminaries. 

[[formula|Formulas]] in MLL may be built from an alphabet $\mathbf{T}$ of propositional variables and two constants $\mathbf{1}$, $\bot$ by applying operations $\otimes$ and $\multimap$. (Negation may be defined by $\neg A \coloneqq A \multimap \bot$, and the multiplicative disjunction by $A \parr B \coloneqq \neg A \multimap B$. To get formulas in MILL, simply drop $\bot$.) The construction of a formula may be displayed as a binary planar tree. 

We consider two-sided sequents $\Gamma = A_1, \ldots, A_m \vdash \Delta = B_1, \ldots, B_n$, wherein the formulas of $\Gamma$ to the left of the turnstyle are called _negative_ and the formulas of $\Delta$ are called _positive_. Subformulas of these formulas acquire signs according to the following rules: 

* The subformulas $S, T$ of $S \otimes T$ have the same sign as $S \otimes T$. 

* The subformula $T$ of $S \multimap T$ has the same sign as $S \multimap T$, while $S$ has the opposite sign. 

We indicate the sign of a subformula using a superscript, e.g., $S^+$.

###### Definition 
A (cut-free) _proof structure_ of type $\Gamma \to \Delta$ (in the language of MLL) is a directed graph whose vertices are subformulas of the formulas of $\Gamma, \Delta$, and whose edges are either 

* "KM-links" (Kelly-Mac Lane links) which are of the form $t^- \to t^+$ between two subformula occurrences of the same variable $t \in \mathbf{T}$ but with opposite sign (always oriented from a negative occurrence to a positive occurrence); 

* Edges in binary construction trees of the formulas $A_i, B_j$, oriented according to the following rules: 

$$\array{
 & & (S \otimes T)^- & & \qquad S^+ & & & & T^+ & & & & (S \multimap T)^- & & \qquad S^- & & & & T^+ \\ 
 & \swarrow & & \searrow & \qquad & \searrow & & \swarrow & & & & \nearrow & & \searrow & \qquad & \nwarrow & & \swarrow & \\ 
S^- & & & & T^- \qquad & & (S \otimes T)^+ & & & S^+ & & & & & T^- \qquad & & (S \multimap T)^+
}$$ 
=-- 

For a proof structure of type $\Gamma \to \Delta$, it is clear that the only information not determined from $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$ are the KM-links. These KM-links give a KM-graph. 

MLL formulas $A$ and proof structures of type $A \to B$ form a category $Struct[\mathbf{T}]$. Composition of proof structures is given by composing the underlying KM-graphs; identity proof structures are given by identity KM-graphs. 

In fact this category of proof structures is a $\ast$-autonomous category. As objects are MLL formulas, it is clear how $\otimes$ and $\multimap$ are defined on objects. (To be continued.) 

### Proof nets 

Proof nets are those proof structures that arise by taking the KM-graphs of morphisms that are definable in the language of $\ast$-autonomous categories. Or, in the language of Girard, proof nets are those proof structures which are "correct" or "valid" (i.e., derivable from a sequent deduction, in a sense explained below). 

More exactly, let $F[\mathbf{T}]$ be the free $\ast$-autonomous category on $\mathbf{T}$ (as discrete category), viewing $\ast$-autonomous categories and functors that preserve $\ast$-autonomous category _strictly_ as a 1-category that is 1-monadic over $Cat$, the category of small categories and functors. Observe that the objects of $F[\mathbf{T}]$ may be identified with MLL formulas. We view the morphisms of $F[\mathbf{T}]$ as representing morphisms that are definable (starting with the datum $\mathbf{T}$). 

As $Struct[\mathbf{T}]$ is $\ast$-autonomous, the obvious inclusion $\mathbf{T} \hookrightarrow Struct[\mathbf{T}]$ induces a unique strict $\ast$-autonomous functor $S: F[\mathbf{T}] \to Struct[\mathbf{T}]$, which may be called the _graphical semantics_ funcor.

###### Definition 
A **proof net** (in the language of MLL) of type $A \to B$ is a proof structure $\pi$ of the form $S(f)$, the graphical semantics of some arrow $f: A \to B$ in $F[\mathbf{T}]$. 
=-- 

For a cedent of formulas $\Gamma = A_1, \ldots, A_n$, let $\bigotimes \Gamma$ be the formula $A_1 \otimes \ldots \otimes A_n$ (associated to the left, say, if one is to be persnickety), and let $\parr \Gamma$ be the formula $A_1 \parr \ldots \parr A_n$. Each proof structure $\pi: \Gamma \to \Delta$ determines (and is determined by) a unique proof structure ${|\pi|}: \bigotimes \Gamma \to \parr \Delta$ with the same underlying KM-graph as $\pi$. 

Then, more generally we may define a proof net of type $\Gamma \to \Delta$ to be a proof structure $\pi: \Gamma \to \Delta$ such that ${|\pi|}$ is a proof net according to the definition above. 

Alternatively, we may define proof nets by reference to MLL sequent calculus, as follows. 

#### Nets of sequent deductions 

## Graphical criterion for validity 

In his original Linear Logic paper, Girard gave an interesting purely graphical criterion for a proof structure to be a proof net (i.e., "valid"), based on his so-called "cyclic trips" and "longtrip criterion". Later this criterion was simplified and improved by Danos and Regnier, who at the same time showed that validity of a proof structure could be decided in polynomial time. We give this criterion below. (**N.B.** this criterion as given by them works for proof structures of type $A \to B$ where there are no subformula occurrences of $\mathbf{1}$ and $\bot$. It may be extended to work for all formulas if we use a more refined notion of proof structure, called a unit-extended proof structure, as described below.)

###### Definition 
A **par switch** (a $\parr$-switch) in a proof structure is a subgraph of one of the two forms 

$$\array{
 & & (S \otimes T)^- & & & & S^- & & & & T^+ \\ 
 & \swarrow & & \searrow & & & \nwarrow & & \swarrow \\ 
S^- & & & & T^- & & & & (S \multimap T)^+ & & 
}$$ 

A **network** of a proof structure $\pi$ is obtained by removing exactly one of the two edges from each par switch of $\pi$.

###### Theorem 
**(Girard, Danos-Regnier)** 
A proof structure $\pi$ is a proof net if every network of $\pi$ is a connected acyclic graph (when considered as an unoriented graph, forgetting edge orientations). 
=-- 

This criterion, thus stated, might appear exponential in complexity, since it appears to involve checking that every one of the $2^p$ networks, where $p$ is the number of par switches, is connected and acyclic. However, Danos and Regnier gave a beautiful simplification which in fact gives an algorithm for deciding validity in polynomial time. (To be described) 

## Unit-extended proof nets 

In his thesis, Trimble introduced a slight refinement of proof structures, designed to take the units $\mathbf{1}$ and $\bot$ more explicitly into account.
