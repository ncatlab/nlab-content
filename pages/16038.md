##Idea
Let $K$ be the strict [[2-category]] [[Cat]] and $C$ a [[category]] in $K$. Then we can identify a [[monad]] on $C$ with an [[endofunctor]] $T:C\to C$ which is a [[monoid]] in $K(C,C)$. We recall that for any [[object]] $c$ of $C$, we obtain a certain sort of [[resolution]] of $c$. Note that the canonical resolution is not a resolution in the sense of the above cited nLab page because it is not necessarily acyclic or [[contractible]] in the relevant sense. In other words, it does not always have trivial [[cohomology]], especially since our category may not even be equipped with such a notion. 

##Definitions
The _canonical resolution_ of $c$ in $C$ with respect to a monad $T:C\to C$ is a [[augmented simplicial set|coaugmented]] [[simplicial object|cosimplicial object]] $CanRes_T:\Delta_+\to C$ such that $CanRes_T([-1])=c$ and $CanRes_T([n])=T^{n+1}c$ for each $n\geq 0$. It has [[coface]] [[morphisms]] $T^{n}c\to T^{n+1}c$ given by the unit map of $T$, and codegeneracies given by the monoid structure $T T c\to T c$. 

###Monadic Cohomology
{#monadiccohomology}

Given a suitable functor $E:C\to A$, for $A$ an [[additive category]], we can define the _monadic cohomology_ of an object $c$ to be the [[cohomology]] of the [[cochain complex]] associated to the composition of [[functors]] $E\circ CanRes_T:\Delta_+\to A.$ By suitably dualizing, we can define _comonadic cohomology_. 

###Resolution of a $T$-algebra

Suppose that $c$ is an object of $C$ and also an [[module over a monad|algebra]] for $T$. Thus there is a [[morphism]] $T c\to c$ satisfying certain properties. In particular, this map provides an extra codegeneracy which defines an [[augmented simplicial set|augmented]] [[simplicial object]] living inside of the canonical resolution of $c$. This simplicial object is frequently referred to as the [[bar construction]] of $c$. 

Note that we can consider this internal [[bar construction]] to also be the canonical resolution associated to the induced [[comonad]] on the [[Eilenberg-Moore category]] of algebras over $T$. 

This [[bar construction]] can also be obtained by precomposing $CanRes_T$ with the functor that includes $\Delta^{op}_+\hookrightarrow \Delta$ as the subcategory whose morphisms preserve the minimal and maximal elements of finite totally ordered sets. 

##Examples

###The bar resolution
There is a monad on [[Set]], the category of sets, comprising the free abelian group functor $F:Set\to Ab$ and the forgetful functor $U:Ab\to Set$. The category of algebras of this monad is precisely the category of Abelian groups (in other words, the [[free abelian group]] functor $F$ is [[monadic]]). Thus we can produce the cosimplicial canonical resolution of any set $X$. If $X$ supports (at least one) abelian group structure, then we can add a codegeneracy to the canonical resolution which defines the usual [[bar construction]] on $X$ with that particular abelian group structure.
