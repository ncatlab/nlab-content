

An [[essential geometric morphism|essential]] [[subtopos]], also called a [[level of a topos]].

Any subtopos is an [[internal locale|internal sublocale]] of the one-point locale. However, this sublocale is an [[essential sublocale]] from the [[internal language|internal point of view]] if and only if the subtopos is an _open_ subtopos (not an essential one). See _[[essential sublocale]]_ for details.
