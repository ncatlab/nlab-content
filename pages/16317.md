## Idea

The concept of _super smooth $\infty$-groupoid_ or _super smooth [[geometric homotopy type]]_ is the combination of _[[super ∞-groupoid]]_ and _[[smooth ∞-groupoid]]_. The [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] of smooth super-$\infty$-groupoids is a context that realizes [[higher geometry|higher]] [[supergeometry]].

Super smooth $\infty$-groupoids include
[[supermanifolds]], [[super Lie groups]] and their [[deloopings]] etc. Under [[Lie differentiation]] these map to [[super L-∞ algebras]].


## Definition

We consider one of at least two possible definitions, that differ (only) in some fine technical detail. The other is at _[[smooth super infinity-groupoid]]_.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Write 

* [[CartSp]] for the site of [[Cartesian spaces]];

* $InfPoint \coloneqq WAlg^{op}$ for the category of first-order [[infinitesimally thickened points]] (i.e. the [[abstract duality|formal duals]] of [[commutative algebras]] over the [[real numbers]] of the form $\mathbb{R}\oplus V$ with $V$ a finite-dimensional  square-0 [[nilpotent ideal]]).

* $SuperPoint \coloneqq WAlg_{super}^{op}$ for the category of [[superpoints]], by which we here mean the [[formal duals]] to commutative [[superalgebras]] which 
are super-[[Weil algebras]].

There are then "semidirect product" sites $CartSp \rtimes InfinPoint$ and $CartSp \rtimes SuperPoint$ (whose objects are [[Cartesian products]] of the given form inside [[synthetic differential supergeometry]] and whose morphisms are all morphisms in that context (not just the product morphisms)).

Set then 

$$
  FormalSmooth\infty Grpd \coloneqq Sh_\infty(CartSp \rtimes InfPoint)
$$

for the collection of [[formal smooth ∞-groupoids]] (see there) and finally

$$
  SuperSmooth\infty Grpd \coloneqq Sh_\infty(CartSp \rtimes SuperPoint)
$$

for that of super smooth $\infty$-groupoid

###### Remark

The [[sites]] in question are alternatingly (co-)[[reflective subcategories]] of each other (we always display [[left adjoints]] above their right adjoints)

$$
  \ast
  \stackrel{\longleftarrow}{\hookrightarrow}
  CartSp
  \stackrel{\hookrightarrow}{\longleftarrow}
  CartSp\rtimes InfPoint
  \stackrel{\longleftarrow}{\stackrel{\hookrightarrow}{\longleftarrow}}
  CartSp \rtimes SuperPoint  
  \,.
$$


Here

* the first inclusion picks the [[terminal object]] $\mathbb{R}^0$;

* the second inclusion is that of [[reduced objects]]; the coreflection is [[reduction]], sending an algebra to its [[reduced algebra]];

* the third inclusion is that of even-graded algebras, the reflection sends a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded algebra to its even-graded part, the co-reflection sends a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded algebra to its quotient by the ideal generated by its odd part, see at _[superalgebra -- Adjoints to the inclusion of plain algebras](super+algebra#AdjointsToInclusionOfPlainAlgebra)_.

###### Remark

Passing to [[(∞,1)-categories of (∞,1)-sheaves]], this yields, via [[(∞,1)-Kan extension]], a sequence of [[adjoint quadruples]] as follows:

$$
  \array{
    & && && &\longleftarrow& 
    \\
    & && &\hookrightarrow& &\hookrightarrow& 
    \\
    & &\longleftarrow& &\longleftarrow& &\longleftarrow&
    \\
    \Delta \colon
    & 
    \infty Grpd
    &\hookrightarrow&
    Smooth \infty Grpd
    &\hookrightarrow&
    FormalSmooth \infty Grpd
    &\hookrightarrow&
    SuperSmooth \infty Grpd
    \\
    & &\longleftarrow& &\longleftarrow&
    \\
    & &\hookrightarrow&
  }
$$



he total composite labeled $\Delta$ is indeed the [[locally constant infinity-stack]]-functor: let $X$ be any object in its image, and $U \times D_s \in CartSp \rtimes SuperPoint$. Then by adjunction $SuperSmooth\infty Grpd(U\times D_s, X)$ is equivalently homs in $FormalSmooth \infty Grpd$ of out the dual of the Weil algebra which is the quotient of the original one by the ideal generated by its odd part. Hence this, in turn, is equivalently homs in $Smooth\infty Grpd$ out of $U$ and that finally is equivalently homs in $\infty Grpd$ out of $\ast$ into the given $\infty$-groupoid.

###### Corollary

Passing to the [[adjoint triples]] of [[idempotent monads]] and [[idempotent comonads]] which this induces, then yields 

* on the left the [[shape modality]] $\int$, [[flat modality]] $\flat$ and [[sharp modality]] $\sharp$, 

* in the middle yields the [[reduction modality]] $\Re$, the [[infinitesimal shape modality]] $\&$ and the [[infinitesimal flat modality]] $\Im$. 

* on the right we get an adjoint triple whose whose middle bit $\rightsquigarrow$ is the [[bosonic modality]] and whose left piece $\e$ produces _super-even_ components, containing all the "[[fermion]] [[currents]]" if one wishes , which in this [[unity of opposites]] hence deserves to be called the _[[fermionic modality]]_. The further right adjoint $\Re$ is the [[rheonomy modality]].

Hence we get a process of [[adjoint modalities]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    && id &\dashv& id 
    \\
    && \vee && \vee
    \\
    &\stackrel{fermionic}{}& \e &\dashv& \rightsquigarrow & \stackrel{bosonic}{}
    \\
    && \bot && \bot
    \\
    &\stackrel{bosonic}{} & \rightsquigarrow &\dashv& \R & \stackrel{rheonomic}{}
    \\
    && \vee && \vee
    \\
    &\stackrel{reduced}{} & \Re &\dashv& \& & \stackrel{infinitesimal}{}
    \\
    && \bot && \bot
    \\
    &\stackrel{infinitesimal}{}& \& &\dashv& \Im & \stackrel{\text{étale}}{}
    \\
    && \vee && \vee
    \\
    &\stackrel{contractible}{}& &#643; &\dashv& \flat & \stackrel{discrete}{}
    \\
    && \bot && \bot
    \\
    &\stackrel{discrete}{}& \flat &\dashv& \sharp & \stackrel{differential}{}
    \\
    && \vee && \vee
    \\
    && \emptyset &\dashv& \ast
  }
$$

where "$\vee$" denotes inclusion of [[modal types]]. The first level is [[cohesion]], the second is [[differential cohesion]] ([[elasticity]]), the third is a further refinement given by supergeometry, which takes further "square roots" of all infinitesimal generators.
