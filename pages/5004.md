## Relational structures ## 

## Idea## 
Relational structures are models for a relational theory, that is, a logical theory whose [[signature (in logic)|signature]] is **relational**.

+--{: .un_defn}
######Definition ######
A __relational structure__ is a tuple $\mathfrak{F}$ whose first component $W$, is a non-empty set, and whose remaining components are relations on $W$. (We assume that there is at least one relation given.) 
=--
In their use in the Kripke semantics of [[modal logics]], the set $W$ is sometimes called the _universe_ (perhaps better the _domain_) and the  elements of $W$ are called 'worlds', amongst a host of other names! This leads to the terminology 'possible world semantics' which is sometimes used.
