## Idea

An _archimedean field_ is an [[ordered field]] in which every element is bounded above by a [[natural number]].

So an archimedan field has no infinite elements (and thus no non-zero [[infinitesimal object|infinitesimal]] elements).


## Properties

### Complete fields

Any [[field]] $k$ equipped with an [[absolute value]] ${\vert -\vert}$ which is a [[complete field]] with respect to the corresponding [[metric]] is archimedean of ${\vert -\vert}$ is archimedean as an [[absolute value]], in which case it is either the [[real numbers]] or the [[complex numbers]], or the absolute value is non-archimedean and then so is the field.


## Non-archimedean field

For $k$ a non-archimedean field for some non-archimedean [[absolute value]] ${\vert -\vert}$ one defines

* its **ring of integers** to be 

  $$
    k^\circ := \{x \in k \,|\, {\vert x\vert} \leq 1\}
    \,.
  $$

This is a [[local ring]] with maximal ideal

$$
  k^{\circ\circ} := \{x \in k \,|\, {\vert x\vert} \lt 1\}
  \,.
$$

* The **residue field** of $k$ is the [[quotient]]

  $$
    \tilde k := k^\circ / k^{\circ \circ}
    \,.
  $$


## Examples

Archimean fields include

* [[real numbers]]

Non-archimean fields include

* [[p-adic numbers]].
