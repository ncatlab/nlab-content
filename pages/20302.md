## Idea

In [[physics]] a _dyon_ is an object that carries both [[electric charge]] as well as [[magnetic charge]]. For [[fundamental particles]] this would correspond to [[magnetic monopoles]] which are also electrically charged. More generally, higher dimensional [[branes]] may (or may not) be dyons in that they are electrically as well as magnetically charged under the appropriate [[higher gauge field]].
