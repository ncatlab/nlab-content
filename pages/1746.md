What is usually called "generalized cohomology" is obtained from a generalization of the axioms of Eilenberg--Steenrod. 

By [[Brown's representability theorem]] this is equivalent to [[cohomology]] with coefficient object a [[spectrum]]. See

* [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]]

  * [[spectrum]]

* [[cohomology group]] .

Notice that there are "generalizations of generalized cohomology". See the discussion at _[[cohomology]]_.
