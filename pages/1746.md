What is usually called "generalized cohomology" is obtained from a generalization of the axioms of Eilenberg-Steenrod. 

This turns out to be equivalent to [[cohomology]] with coefficient object a [[spectrum]]. See

* [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]]

  * [[spectrum]]

* [[cohomology group]] .

Notice that there is a "generalization of generalized cohomology", called [[nonabelian cohomology]].
