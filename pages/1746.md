By a **generalized cohomology theory** is usually meant a contravariant functor on a [[homotopy category]] satisfying all abstract properties of [[ordinary cohomology]], except possibly for the dimension axiom. For more on this see at 

* **[[Whitehead-generalized cohomology]]**.
  
  (and for the dual concept see at _[[generalized homology]]_).

But there are more general generalizations of the concept of ordinary cohomology, too. For instance there is also 

* [[nonabelian cohomology]]

* [[sheaf cohomology]]

* [[differential cohomology]]

etc.

For a fully general concept of generalized cohomology, see at

* [[cohomology]].
