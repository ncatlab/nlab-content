__Goldblatt-Thomason theorem__ is a theorem in [[modal logic]] which characterizes the elementary classes which are also modally definable classes. It says that if $K$ is an elementary class of Kripke frames, then $K$ is modally definable iff $K$ is closed under taking bounded morphic images, generated subframes, disjoint unions, and reflects ultrafilter extensions.

## Idea ##
There is a duality between Modal algebras and [[Kripke frames]]. Since Modal algebras form a [[variety of algebras]], by an application of [[Birkhoff's HSP theorem]], after a translation from Modal algebras onto Kripke frames we obtain the above result.
