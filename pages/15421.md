###### Definition

An **[[affinoid domain]]** in an [[affinoid space]] $X = Spec_{an} A$ is a [[closed subset]] $V \subset X$ such that there is a [[homomorphism]] of $k$-affinoid spaces 

$$
  \phi : Spec_{an} A_V \to X
$$

for some $A_V$, whose [[image]] is $V$, and such that every other morphism of $k$-affinoid spaces into $X$ whose image is contained in $V$ uniquely factors through this morphism.
