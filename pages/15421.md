## Idea

In the context of [[non-archimedean analytic geometry]], affinoid domains are basic model [[spaces]]: a [[Berkovich analytic space]] is, in particular, a [[topological space]] equipped with an [[atlas]] by ([[analytic spectra]] underlying) affinoid domains.

## Definition

###### Definition

An **[[affinoid domain]]** in an [[affinoid space]] $X = Spec_{an} A$ is a [[closed subset]] $V \subset X$ such that there is a [[homomorphism]] of $k$-affinoid spaces 

$$
  \phi : Spec_{an} A_V \to X
$$

for some $A_V$, whose [[image]] is $V$, and such that every other morphism of $k$-affinoid spaces into $X$ whose image is contained in $V$ uniquely factors through this morphism.

###### Definition

A morphism $f\colon X\to Y$ of [[affinoid spaces]] is an _affionoid domain embedding_ if it induces an [[isomorphism]] of $X$ with an affinoid domain in $Y$

([Berkovich 09, def. 2.2.7](#Berkovich09))

These are the "admissible morphisms" in the site of affinoid domains. (...)
