## Idea

In the specification of [[theory (physics)|physical theories]] sometimes it is assumed that the space of [[field (physics)|fields]] on some [[spacetime]]/[[worldvolume]] $X$ is the space of [[sections]] of some [[fiber bundle]] $E \to X$. This is then called the _field bundle_.

###### Remark

The dual [[jet bundle]] of the field bundle serves as the _[[extended phase space]]_ in [[multisymplectic geometry]].
The [[de Rham complex]] of the [[jet bundle]] of the field bundle, equipped with its canonical horizontal/vertical bigrading, is the _[[variational bicomplex]]_ of the system.

###### Remark

The notion of field bundle captures only some aspects of the general notion of spaces of physical fields. For instance the configurations of the _[[B-field]]_ do not form sections of a fiber bundle (but of a [[fiber infinity-bundle|fiber 2-bundle]]) and hence for instance the [magnetic charge anomaly](magnetic+charge#MagneticChargeAnomaly) has no real description by field bundles. See at _[[field (physics)]]_ in the section _[The idea of field bundles and its problems](field+%28physics%29#IdeaOfFieldBundlesAndItsProblems)_ for more.

## Examples

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

For $E \to X$ the trivial bundle $X \times \mathbb{R} \to X $ or $X \times \mathbb{C} \to X$ a smooth section is simply a [[smooth function]] on $X$ with values in the [[real numbers]] or [[complex numbers]], respectively. In [[physics]] this is called a _[[scalar field]]_.

###### Example

More generally, for $V$ a [[vector space]], the trivial field bundle $X \times V \to X$ has as secton $V$-valued functions. These are also called _linear [[sigma-model]]_ fields.

Still more generally, if $Y$ is any manifold, then the sections of the tricial field bundle $X \times Y \to X$ are called _non-linear [[sigma-model]]_ fields.

###### Example

For $X$ a [[smooth manifold]] and $E \to X$ some [[tensor product]] of copies of the [[tangent bundle]] $T X \to X$ and the [[cotangent bundle]] $T^* X \to X$ a section is a [[tensor field]] of the corresponding rank.

Many physical fields are related to tensor fields, but few are genuinely tensor fields. See at _[[field (physics)]]_ for more on this.
