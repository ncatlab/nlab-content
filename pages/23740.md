## Definition

Given a [[commutative ring]] $R$, an [[element]] $e \in R$ is *left cancellative* or *left regular* if $e \cdot a = e \cdot b$ for all $a \in R$ and $b \in R$, then $a = b$. 

$$\mathrm{isLeftCancellative}(e) \coloneqq \forall a,b \in R.(e \cdot a = e \cdot b) \implies (a = b)$$

An element $e \in R$ is *right cancellative* or *right regular* if $a \cdot e = b \cdot e$ for all $a \in R$ and $b \in R$, then $a = b$. 

$$\mathrm{isRightCancellative}(e) \coloneqq \forall a,b \in M.(a \cdot e = b \cdot e) \implies (a = b)$$

An element $e \in R$ is *cancellative* or *regular* if it is both left cancellative and right cancellative.

$$\mathrm{isCancellative}(e) \coloneqq \mathrm{isLeftCancellative}(e) \wedge \mathrm{isRightCancellative}(e)$$

## Properties ##

\begin{theorem}
Given a commutative ring $R$, if an element $e:R$ is a cancellative element, then it is a non-[[zero-divisor]], where non-zero-divisor is defined as an element $a:R$ such that every element $b:R$ such that $b \cdot a = 0$ or $a \cdot b = 0$ is equal to $0$. 
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Suppose that $e:R$ is cancellative. This means that for all elements $a:R$ and $b:R$, $a \cdot e = b \cdot e$ and $e \cdot a = e \cdot b$, which both imply $a = b$. For the first equation, subtracting $b \cdot e$ from both sides of the equation leads to $(a - b) \cdot e = 0$, and for the second equation, subtraction $e \cdot b$ from both sides of the equation leads to $e \cdot (a - b) = 0$. Subtracting $b$ from both sides of $a = b$ leads to $a - b = 0$. Defining the element $c := a - b$ results in the condition that for every element $c:R$, $c \cdot e = 0$ and $e \cdot c = 0$ is equal to $0$, which implies that $e$ is a non-[[zero-divisor]]. 
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
Every non-zero-divisor $e:R$ of a commutative ring $R$ is a cancellative element. 
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Suppose that $e:R$ is a non-zero-divisor. This means that 
\end{proof}

## Multiplicative subset of cancellative elements ##

The **multiplicative subset of cancellative elements** in $R$ is the [[multiplicative subset]] of all cancellative elements in $R$

$$\mathrm{Can}(R) \coloneqq \{e \in M \vert \mathrm{isCancellative}(e)\}$$

If the synonym 'regular element' is used in place of 'cancellative element', such as in [Lombardi & Quitté 2010](#LombardiQuitté2010), then this multiplicative subset is typically written as $\mathrm{Reg}(R)$. 

Since the multiplicative identity element $1$ is always cancellative, the multiplicative subset of all cancellative elements forms a [[cancellative monoid]].
