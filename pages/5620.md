## Idea

The __Virasoro algebra__ or _Virasoro [[Lie algebra]]_ is the nontrivial [[central extension]] of the [[Witt Lie algebra]] (the Lie algebra of the [[diffeomorphism group|group of diffeomorphisms]] of the [[circle]]). It is of central importance in some questions of [[complex analysis]], in [[conformal field theory]] and the study of [[affine Lie algebras]]. 

## Definition

The generators $L_n$ of the Virasoro algebra are indexed by an integer $n \in \mathbb{Z}$, and they satisfy the commutation relation

$$
[L_m, L_n] = (m - n) L_{m+n} + \frac{c}{12}(m^3 - m) \delta_{m+n,0}.
$$

Here, $c$ denotes the element of the algebra known as the **[[central charge]]**; it commutes with each generator,

$$
[L_n, c] = 0 \forall n.
$$

The factor of 1/12 is conventional and chosen for normalisation purposes.
