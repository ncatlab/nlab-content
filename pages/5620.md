__Virasoro algebra__ or Virasoro Lie algebra is the nontrivial central extension of the Witt Lie algebra (the Lie algebra of the group of diffeomorphisms of the circle). It is of central importance in some questions of complex analysis, in [[conformal field theory]] and the study of affine Lie algebras.
