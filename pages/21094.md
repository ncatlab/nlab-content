## Idea

In [[perturbative quantum gravity]], the  _soft graviton theorem_ ([Weinberg 65](#Weinberg65)) re-formulates [[scattering amplitudes]] of a set of finite energy external particles with one or more low energy external [[gravitons]], in terms of the amplitude without the low energy gravitons.

In the [[classical limit]], there is a different manifestation of the same theorem ([Saha-Sahoo-Sen 19](#SahaSahooSen19)): here it determines the low frequency component of the [[gravitational wave]]-form produced during a scattering process in terms of the momenta and spin of the incoming and outgoing objects, without any reference to the interactions responsible for the scattering.
