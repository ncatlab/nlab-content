## Idea


In [[mathematics]] it happens at times that one and the same concept is given two different names to indicate a specific perspective, a certain attitude as to what to do with such objects. 

## Examples

### Series

A _[[series]]_ is just a [[sequence]].

But one says _series_ instead of _sequence_ when one is interested in studying its partial [[sums]]. In particular it means something different to say that a series _converges_ than to say that a sequence converges. The series $n\mapsto a_n$ converges if and only if the sequence $n\mapsto \sum_{i\lt n}a_i$ converges. 

### Presheaves and copresheaves

A _[[presheaf]]_ is just a [[contravariant functor|contravariant]] [[functor]], just as a [[copresheaf]] is just a functor.  

(More specifically, an "$S$-valued presheaf" is a contravariant functor with [[codomain]] a given [[category]] $S$; in modern [[category theory]] the "default" value of $S$ for a presheaf is usually [[Set]].) 

But one says _presheaf_ instead of (set-valued) _contravariant functor_ when one is interested in studying its [[sheafification]], or even if one is just interested in regarding the [[category of functors]] with its structure of a [[topos]]: the [[presheaf topos]].

### Young diagrams

A *[[Young diagram]]* is a [[partition]] that wants to become a [[Young tableaux]].

### Quivers

A _[[quiver]]_ is just a [[directed graph]] ([[pseudograph]], to be explicit). 

But one says _quiver_ instead of _directed graph_ when one is interested in studying _[[quiver representations]]_: [[functors]] from the [[free category]] on that graph to the [[category]] of [[finite-dimensional vector spaces]].


### Fields (physics)
 {#FieldsInPhysics}

A _[[field (in physics)]]_ is just a [[section]] of a [[fiber bundle]]. 

But in [[mathematical physics]] one says _field_ instead of _section of a fiber bundle_ to indicate that one is going to consider a [[Lagrangian density]] on the corresponding [[jet bundle]] of the given [[fiber bundle]] (then called the _[[field bundle]]_ ) and study the induced [[classical field theory|classical]] or [[quantum field theory]]. 


### Random variables and estimators

Both [[random variable|random variables]] and estimators are almost always just [[real number|real valued]] [[measurable function| measurable maps]]. Though sometimes the former takes more general values in some [[Polish space]] instead.

But in [[probability theory]] a random variable is interpreted as a map from a _sample space_ to a _space of [[state|states]]_ which represents the observed outcomes or outcomes predicted by some model.
In contrast in [[statistics]] an estimator guesses or estimates a certain parameter associated to some random model.

### Tensor networks
  {#TensorNetworks}

A _[[tensor network]]_ is just a [[string diagram]] (i.e. [[Penrose notation]]).

But in discussion of the [[AdS/CFT correspondence in solid state physics]] one says _[[tensor network]]_ when regarding [[string diagrams]] as encoding [[quantum states]] in the [[Hilbert space]] which is the [[tensor product]] of all the external [[vertices]].
