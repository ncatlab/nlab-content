## Idea


In [[mathematics]] it happens at times that one and the same concept is given two different names to indicate a specific perspective, a certain attitude as to what to do with such objects. 

## Examples


* A _[[presheaf]]_ is just a [[contravariant functor|contravariant]] [[functor]]. But one says _presheaf_ instead of _contravariant functor_ when one is interested in studying its [[sheafification]], or even if one is just intersted in regarding the [[category of functors]] with its structure of a [[topos]]: the [[presheaf topos]].

* A _[[quiver]]_ is just a [[directed graph]] ([[pseudograph]], to be explicit). But one says _quiver_ instead of _directed graph_ when one is interested in studying _[[quiver representations]]_: [[functors]] from the [[free category]] on that graph to the [[category]] of [[finite-dimensional vector spaces]].
