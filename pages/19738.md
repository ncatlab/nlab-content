## Idea


In [[mathematics]] it happens at times that one and the same concept is given two different names to indicate a specific perspective, a certain attitude as to what to do with such objects. 

## Examples

### Presheaves

A _[[presheaf]]_ is just a [[contravariant functor|contravariant]] [[functor]].  

(More specifically, an "$S$-valued presheaf" is a contravariant functor with [[codomain]] a given [[category]] $S$; in modern [[category theory]] the "default" value of $S$ for a presheaf is usually [[Set]].) 

But one says _presheaf_ instead of (set-valued) _contravariant functor_ when one is interested in studying its [[sheafification]], or even if one is just intersted in regarding the [[category of functors]] with its structure of a [[topos]]: the [[presheaf topos]].

### Quivers

A _[[quiver]]_ is just a [[directed graph]] ([[pseudograph]], to be explicit). 

But one says _quiver_ instead of _directed graph_ when one is interested in studying _[[quiver representations]]_: [[functors]] from the [[free category]] on that graph to the [[category]] of [[finite-dimensional vector spaces]].


### Fields (physics)
 {#FieldsInPhysics}

A _[[field (in physics)]]_ is just a [[section]] of a [[fiber bundle]]. 

But in [[mathematical physics]] one says _field_ instead of _section of a fiber bundle_ to indicate that one is going to consider a [[Lagrangian density]] on the corresponding [[jet bundle]] of the given [[fiber bundle]] (then called the _[[field bundle]]_ ) and study the induced [[classical field theory|classical]] or [[quantum field theory]].
