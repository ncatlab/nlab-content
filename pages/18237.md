###### Definition
**([[open maps]] and [[closed maps]])**

A [[continuous function]] $f \colon (X,\tau_X) \to (Y, \tau_Y)$ between [[topological spaces]]  is called

*  an _[[open map]]_ if the [[image]] under $f$ of an [[open subset]] of $X$ is an open subset of $Y$;

* a _[[closed map]]_ if the [[image]] under $f$ of a [[closed subset]] of $X$  is a closed subset of $Y$.

###### Example
**([[image]] projections of [[open map|open]]/[[closed maps]] are themselves open/closed)**

If a [[continuous function]] $f \colon (X,\tau_X) \to (Y,\tau_Y)$ is an [[open map]] or [[closed map]] (def. \ref{OpenMap})
then so is its [[image]] projection $X \to f(X) \subset Y$, respectively, for $f(X) \subset Y$ regarded with its
[[subspace topology]].

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

If $f$ is an open map, and $O \subset X$ is an open subset, so that $f(O) \subset Y$ is also open in $Y$, then, since $f(O) = f(O) \cap f(X)$, it is also still open in the subspace topology, hence $X \to f(X)$ is an open map.

If $f$ is a closed map, and $C \subset X$ is a closed subset so that also $f(C) \subset Y$ is a closed subset, then the [[complement]] $Y \backslash f(C)$ is open in $Y$ and  hence $(Y \backslash f(C)) \cap f(X) = f(X) \backslash f(C)$ is open in the subspace topology, which means that $f(C)$ is closed in the subspace topology.

###### Example
**([[projections]] out of [[product spaces]] are open maps)**

For $(X_1,\tau_{X_1})$ and $(X_2,\tau_{X_2})$ two [[topological spaces]], then the projection maps

$$
  pr_i \;\colon\; (X_1 \times X_2, \tau_{X_1 \times X_2}) \longrightarrow (X_i, \tau_{X_i})
$$

out of their [[product topological space]] 

$$
  \array{
    X_1 \times X_2 &\overset{pr_1}{\longrightarrow}& X_1
    \\
    (x_1, x_2) &\overset{\phantom{AAA}}{\mapsto}& x_1
  }
$$

$$
  \array{
    X_1 \times X_2 &\overset{pr_2}{\longrightarrow}& X_2
    \\
    (x_1, x_2) &\overset{\phantom{AAA}}{\mapsto}& x_2
  }
$$

are [[open maps|open]] [[continuous functions]]  (def. \ref{OpenMap}).

This is because, by definition, every open subset $O \subset X_1 \times X_2$ in the product space topology is a union of products of
open subsets $U_i \in X_1$ and $V_i \in X_2$ in the factor spaces

$$
  O = \underset{i \in I}{\cup} \left( U_i \times V_i  \right)
$$

and because taking the image of a function preserves unions of subsets

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    pr_1\left(
      \underset{i \in I}{\cup} \left( U_i \times V_i \right)
    \right)
    & =
    \underset{i \in I}{\cup}
    pr_1
    \left(
      U_i \times V_i
    \right)
    \\
    & =
    \underset{i \in I}{\cup} U_i
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
