## Idea

In [[type theory]], a **positive type** is one whose *constructors* are regarded as primary.  Its eliminators are derived from these by the rule that "to use an element of a positive type, it is necessary and sufficient to specify what should be done for all possible ways that element could have been constructed".

In [[categorical semantics]] of type theory, positive types correspond to "from the left" universal properties (i.e. for mapping out).

## Examples

* [[inductive type]]

* cartesian [[product types]] can be presented both positively and negatively, as can binary [[sum types]].  The two definitions are equivalent in ordinary type theory, but distinct in [[linear logic]].
