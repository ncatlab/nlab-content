## Idea

In a [[closed monoidal category]] $C$ the [[tensor product]] $a \otimes b$ and [[internal hom]] $[b,c]$ are related by the defining [[natural isomorphism]]


$$
  C(a \otimes b, c) \simeq C(a, [b,c])
  \,.
$$

The notion of **copowering** generalizes this to the situation where a category $C$ does not act on itself by tensors, but where another category $V$ acts on $C$.

The dual notion is that of [[power]]ing.

## Definition 

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

Let $V$ be a [[closed monoidal category|closed]] [[monoidal category]].  In a $V$-[[enriched category]] $C$, the **copower** of an object $x\in C$ by an object $k\in V$ is an object $k\odot x \in C$ with a [[natural isomorphism]]

$$
  C(k\odot x, y) \cong V(k, C(x,y))
$$

where $C(-,-)$ is the $V$-valued [[hom-functor]] of $C$ and $V(-,-)$ is the [[internal hom]] of $V$.

###### Remark


Copowers are frequently called _tensors_ and a $V$-category having all copowers is called _tensored_, while the word "copower" is reserved for the case $V=Set$.  However, there seems to be no good reason for making this distinction.  Moreover, the word "tensor" is fairly overused, and unfortunate since a tensor (= a copower) is a colimit, while a cotensor (= [[power]]) is a limit.

## Properties

* Copowers are a special sort of [[weighted limit|weighted colimit]].  Conversely, all weighted colimits can be constructed from copowers together with [[conical colimits]] (i.e., ordinary $Set$-based colimits with an enhanced $V$-universal property, although the latter is automatic if powers also exist), assuming these exist.  The dual limit notion of a copower is a [[power]].


## Examples

\begin{example}\label{GeneralBasicExamples}
Let $V$ be a [[Bénabou cosmos]]. 

* In $V$ regarded as a $V$-[[enriched category]] over itself, the copower is just the given [[tensor product]] of $V$.

* If $B$ is $V$-copowered and $A$ is $V$-small, then the $V$-[[enriched functor category]] $B^A$ is $V$-copowered. 

* If $C$ is $V$-copowered and $B \to C$ is a $V$-[[reflective subcategory|reflective full embedding]], then $B$ is also copowered. 

\end{example}

\begin{example}\label{CopoweringOfSmallCategoriesOverSet}
**(copowering of small categories over set)**
\linebreak
Every [[locally small category]] $C$ with all [[coproducts]] is canonically copowered over [[Set]]: the copowering functor

  $$
    \otimes \,\colon\, Set \times C \to C
  $$

  sends $(S,b)$ to the [[coproduct]] of $|S|$-many copies of $b \in C$:

  $$
    S \otimes b \coloneqq \coprod_{s \in S} b
    \,.
  $$

  The defining [[natural isomorphism]] in this situation is then just the fact that the [[hom functor]] [[hom-functor preserves limits|sends colimits in its first argument to limits]]:

  $$
    C(\coprod_{s \in S} b , c)
    \simeq
    \prod_{s \in S} C(b,c)
    \simeq
    Set(S, C(b,c))
    \,.
  $$
\end{example}

\begin{example}
**(copowering of the category of monoids)**
\linebreak
A particularly illuminating instance of Example \ref{CopoweringOfSmallCategoriesOverSet} occurs when $C$ is the [[category of monoids]] (or that [[Groups|of groups]]). In this case, the copower $X\otimes A$ of a [[monoid]] $A$ by a set $X$ is the [[free product]] of $X$ copies of $A$, which can more concretely be described as a "one-sided version" of the [[tensor product of commutative monoids]]. Indeed, $X\otimes A$ is the monoid consisting of

  - The set given by the quotient of the free (noncommutative) monoid $Free(X\times A)$ on $X\times A$ by the congruence relation $\sim$ generated by the relations
    $$
        \begin{aligned}
            (x,a)(x,b) &\sim (x,a b),\\
            (x,1_A)    &\sim ()
        \end{aligned}
    $$
    for each $x\in X$ and each $a,b\in A$, where $()$ is the unit of $Free(X\times A)$. Here, for each $x\in X$ and each $a\in A$, we write $x\otimes a$ for the equivalence class of $(x,a)$.
  - The product given by concatenation, i.e. by
    $$
        (x\otimes a)\cdot_{X\otimes A}(y\otimes b)
        =
        (x\otimes a)(y\otimes b),
    $$
    for each $x\otimes a,y\otimes b\in X\otimes A$;
  - The unit given by
    $$1_{X\otimes A}=x\otimes 1_A,$$
    which is independent of $x$, as $x\otimes 1_A=()=y\otimes 1_A$ for all $x,y\in A$.

  Explicitly, $\coprod_{x\in X}A$ is isomorphic to the above monoid via the isomorphism sending $(x_{1}\otimes a_{1})\cdots(x_{n}\otimes a_{n})$ to the element of $\coprod_{x\in X}A$ given by the word $a^{(x_{1})}_{1}\cdots a^{(x_{n})}_{n}$, where $a^{(x_{i})}_{i}$ is the element $a_{i}$ in the $x_{i}$-th copy of $A$ in the expression $\coprod_{x\in X}A$.

  The [[universal property]] of the copower $X\otimes A$ states that a morphism of monoids from $X\otimes A$ to a monoid $B$ is the same data as a "left-bilinear" map of sets $f\colon A\times X\to B$, satisfying
  $$
  \begin{aligned}
      f(a b,x) &= f(a,x)f(b,x),\\
      f(1_A,x) &= 1_B
  \end{aligned}
  $$
  for each $x\in X$.

  The copower $\otimes\colon Set\times Mon\to Mon$ also endows $Mon$ with [[skew monoidal]] structures $\triangleleft$ and $\triangleright$, given by
  $$
  \begin{aligned}
      A\triangleleft B  &= |B|\odot A,\\
      A\triangleright B &= |A|\odot B
  \end{aligned}
  $$
  for each $A,B\in Obj(Mon)$, where $|A|$ and $|B|$ are the underlying sets of $A$ and $B$. While monoids in $CMon$ with respect to the [[tensor product of commutative monoids]] are [[semirings]], monoids in $Mon$ with respect to $\triangleleft$ and $\triangleright$ recover left and right [[near-semirings]].
