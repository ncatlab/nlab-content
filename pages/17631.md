## Idea

Catalan numbers are a specific sequence of [[negative number|nonnegative]] [[integers]], here denoted $C_n$, with a ubiquitous [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] interpretations. In terms of [[binomial coefficients]] they are given by

$$ 
  C_n = \frac{1}{n+1}\binom{2 n}{n} = frac1{2n+1}\binom{2n+1}{n}
  \,.
$$

The Catalan numbers $C_n$ count a myriad of different families of objects, including:

* nonisomorphic (rooted planar) binary [[trees]] with $n$ internal [[vertices]];

* ways of defining the product of elements $x_0,\dots,x_n$ within a (not necessarily [[associative]]) [[magma]], or equivalently, ways of fully parenthesizing a string of $n+1$ letters;

* nonisomorphic rooted planar [[trees]] with $n$ [[edges]];

* strings consisting of $n$ well-balanced pairs of parentheses (also known as "Dyck words"), or equivalently, [[surjective]] [[monotone functions]] $w : (n) + (n) \to (2n)$ such that $w(\iota_1 j) \le w(\iota_2 j)$ for all $1 \le j \le n$;

* monotonic lattice paths in an $n\times n$ grid which do not cross below the diagonal, or equivalently, [[injective]] [[monotone functions]] $p : [2n] \to [n] \times [n]$ such that $\pi_1 p(i) \le \pi_2 p(i)$ for all $0 \le i \le 2n$;

* [[monotone functions]] $f : [n] \to [n]$ such that $f(0) = 0$ and $x \le f(x)$ for all $0 \le x \le n$, or in other words, [[pointed endomorphisms]] $[n] \to [n]$ in $\Delta_\bot$ (the sub-2-category of the [[simplex category|simplex 2-category]] $\Delta$ spanned by the first-element-preserving functions);

and many, many more besides (see the [Stanley](#Stanley2015) references and OEIS [A000108](#a000108)).


## Some bijective correspondences 

In many cases it is Not difficult to exhibit natural isomorphisms between the various [[species]] of structures named above:

###### Example 
Let $T$ be a rooted planar binary tree with $n \gt 0$ internal vertices, specified by left and right trees $T_l, T_r$ with $n_l, n_r$ internal vertices respectively ($n = n_l + n_r + 1$). An element $m(T)$ of the free magma generated by a singleton $x$ is defined recursively by $m(T) = m(T_l) m(T_r)$ (writing the magma product as a juxtaposition). If $T$ is the unique rooted planar tree with $0$ internal vertices, then $m(T)$ is defined to be $x$.

It is often suggestive to use exponential notation, e.g., $m(T) = m(T_l)^{m(T_r)}$, to formally denote denote the magma operation. To each element $a$ of the free magma $Mag(x)$ on $x$, there is an unary operation $(-)^a$, and hence there is a canonical map $Mag(x)^\ast \to \hom(Mag(x), Mag(x)$ from the free monoid on $Mag(x)$ to the monoid of unary operators. If  $\ast$ denotes multiplication in the free monoid, and we denote the monoid map by $a \mapsto (-)^a$, then formally 

$$a^{b \ast c} = (a^b)^c.$$ 

Every element in $Mag(x)$ may then be written uniquely in reduced form $x^w$, by regarding $a^{b \ast c}$ as a reduction of $(a^b)^c$, and obtaining a word $w$ in the operations $\ast$, $(-)^{(-)}$ written in reduced (i.e., irreducible) form. For example, 

* $((x^x)^x)^x \rightsquigarrow x^{x \ast x \ast x}$ 

* $(x^{x^x})^x \rightsquigarrow x^{x^x \ast x}$, 

* $(x^x)^{x^x} \rightsquigarrow x^{x \ast x^x}$, 

* $(x^{x^x})^x \rightsquigarrow x^{x^x \ast x}$, 

* $x^{x^{x^x}} \rightsquigarrow x^{x^{x^x}}$. 

From the structure of the exponent $w$ of a magma element written in reduced form, we may write down a corresponding rooted planar tree.
