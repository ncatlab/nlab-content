For $U : C \to D$ a [[forgetful functor]] that forgets some [[stuff, structure, property]], if it has a [[left adjoint]] $F : D \to C$ that left adjoint may be naturally interpreted as sending any object $d \in D$ to the object $\hat d \in C$ obtained by _freely equipping it with $D$-structure_ .

Do you want to distinguish this from [[free functor]]?  ---Toby
