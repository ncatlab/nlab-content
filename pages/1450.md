#Idea#

In _synthetic differential geometry_ one formulates differential geometry in a [[topos]] of [[space and quantity|generalized spaces]] which has object $T$ that behaves like an infinitesimal interval, so that for instance for $X$ another object regarded as a smooth space, the tangent bundle of $X$, is, again as an object of the topos, just the [[internal hom]] $T X := [T,X]$.

In topoi satisfying the axioms of synthetic differential geometry it is possible to give precise well-defined meaning to many of the familiar computations -- wide-spread in particular in the [[physics]] literature -- that compute with supposedly "infinitesimal" quantities.

As quoted by Anders Kock in his book (see below), Sophus Lie once said that he found his main theorems in [[Lie theory]] using "synthetic reasoning", but had to write them up in non-synthetic style (see [[analytic versus synthetic]]) through lack of a formalized language.  Synthetic differential geometry now provides this formalized language.

In the book

* Moerdijk-Reyes, _Models for Smooth Infinitesimal Analysis_ 

a realization of a [[topos]] for synthetic differential geometry is constructed in terms of [[structured generalized space|structured generalized spaces]] modeled on [[generalized smooth algebra]]s. Among other things, the book describes in detail how the familiar but ill-defined "infinitesimal reasoning" in standard differential geometry finds it precise formulation in such a topos.

In this vein, Anders Kock, in a long series of articles, reformulates large parts of differential geometry using synthetic reasoning. In his work he particularly makes use of the fact that as sophisticated as a synthetic [[topos]] may be when explicitly constructed, being a [[topos]] means that one can reason inside it almost literarally as in [[Set]]. Using this Kock's work gives descriptions of synthetic differential geometry which are entirely intuitive and have no topo-theoretic flavor. All he needs is the assumption that the _Kock-Lawvere axiom_ is satisfied for "numbers". Here "numbers" is really to be interpreted in the topos, but if one just accepts that they satisfy the KL axiom, one may work with infinitesimals in this context in essentially precisely the naive way, with the topos theory in the background just ensuring that everything makes good sense.

# Generalization #

Synthetic differential geometry may be thought of as embedded in the general theory of [[derived smooth manifold]]s and, generally, that of [[structured generalized space]]s.
