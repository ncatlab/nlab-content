## Definition

A **combinatorial map** is a set $D$ equipped with a triple of permutations $(\sigma,\alpha,\phi)$ on $D$ such that:

1. the [[subgroup]] $\langle \sigma,\alpha,\phi\rangle$ of $End(D)$ generated by the permutations acts [[transitive action|transitively]] on $D$;

1. the composition of the permutations is the identity: $\phi\alpha\sigma = id$;

1. $\alpha$ is a [[fixed point]] free [[involution]].

## Alternative definition

Some authors equivalently define a combinatorial map as just a pair $(\sigma,\alpha)$ of permutations, where $\langle \sigma,\alpha\rangle$ acts transitively on $D$ and $\alpha$ is a fixed point free involution.  By the condition that $\phi\alpha\sigma = id$, the third permutation $\phi$ can always be recovered as $\phi = \sigma^{-1}\alpha^{-1}$.

## Hypermaps

If one drops condition (3) in the definition of combinatorial map (i.e., the requirement that $\alpha$ be a fixed point free involution), what remains is a generalization called a **combinatorial hypermap**.
