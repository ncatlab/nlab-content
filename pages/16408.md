## Idea

A **combinatorial map** (or **algebraic map**) is a representation of a graph embedded in a surface (i.e., a [[topological map]]) as a set and a list of permutations acting on that set, with the property that two combinatorial maps are equivalent up to [[conjugation action|conjugation]] if and only if the corresponding graph embeddings are equivalent up to [[homeomorphism]] of the underlying surfaces. The precise formulation depends upon assumptions made about the underlying surface (e.g., whether it is [[connected space|connected]] and/or [[oriented]]) and about the underlying graph (e.g., whether all vertices have a fixed degree), but typically different classes of topological maps can be represented by lists of permutations satisfying different sets of constraints.

## Oriented maps and hypermaps

### Ordinary maps

The following definition corresponds to the case which is perhaps most well-studied:

###### Definition
An **oriented combinatorial map** $M$ is a set $D$ (whose elements are called _darts_) equipped with a triple of [[permutations]] $(\sigma,\alpha,\phi)$ on $D$ such that:

1. the [[subgroup]] $\langle \sigma,\alpha,\phi\rangle$ of $Aut(D)$ generated by the permutations acts [[transitive action|transitively]] on $D$;

1. the composition of the permutations is the identity: $\phi\alpha\sigma = id$;

1. $\alpha$ is a [[fixed point]]-free [[involution]].

A [[homomorphism]] of oriented combinatorial maps

$$M \to M'$$

where $M = (D,(\sigma,\alpha,\phi)), M' = (D',(\sigma',\alpha',\phi'))$ is a function $h : D \to D'$ which commutes with each of the respective permutations,

$$h\sigma = \sigma'h \qquad h\alpha = \alpha'h \qquad h\phi = \phi' h.$$

Hence, $M$ and $M'$ are [[isomorphic]] as maps if and only there is a bijection $h : D \cong D'$ between their underlying sets of darts, such that the triple of permutations $(\sigma,\alpha,\phi)$ is mapped by the [[conjugation action]] of $h$ to the triple of permutations $(\sigma',\alpha',\phi')$.

In the literature, oriented combinatorial maps are often simply referred to as "combinatorial maps".  Also, many authors equivalently define an oriented combinatorial map by a pair $(\sigma,\alpha)$ of permutations, since by condition (2) above, the third permutation $\phi$ can always be recovered uniquely as $\phi = \sigma^{-1}\alpha^{-1}$.

### Representation of a graph embedded in an oriented surface

Let $\theta$ be an embedding of a [[graph]] $G = (V,E)$ into a [[surface]] $X$ which is [[compact]], [[connected]], [[oriented]], and without [[boundary]].  We can associate a combinatorial map to this topological embedding, which is unique up to isomorphism:

* $D$ is defined as a set containing $2n$ elements, where $n = |E|$, with a pair of distinct darts $e^+,e^- \in D$ for each $e \in E$.  These darts may be visualized as oriented edges, or alternatively as half-edges (splitting each of the original edges in the middle).

* the collection of edges $E$ induces a fixed point-free involution $\alpha$ on $D$, by swapping $e^+$ with $e^-$ for each edge $e \in E$.

* suppose darts are visualized as oriented edges: we will say that a dart $d$ is _incident_ to a vertex $x$ if $x$ is the unique vertex located at the source of $d$.  Then every vertex $x\in V$ determines a cyclic ordering of the darts incident to $x$, by considering (say) a counterclockwise-oriented [[loop]] around $\theta(x)$.  In this way (which relies on the assumption that $X$ is oriented), each vertex determines a cycle of the permutation $\sigma$.

* similarly, we say that a dart $d$ is incident to a face $f$ (i.e., a connected component of $X \setminus \theta(G)$) if $f$ is the unique face appearing to the left of $d$.  Then each face $f$ determines a cyclic ordering of darts incident to $f$ (corresponding to a clockwise traversal along the perimeter of $f$), and we can combine these disjoint cycles into a single permutation $\phi$.

* by a simple visual argument, it is easy to check that if we start at any dart $d \in D$, then apply the permutation $\sigma$ followed by $\alpha$ followed followed by $\phi$, we always end up back at $d$.

### Genus of a combinatorial map

By the previous construction, it is natural to define the **genus** $g$ of an oriented combinatorial map $M = (\sigma,\alpha,\phi)$ using the [[Euler characteristic|Euler-Poincar√© formula]],

$$\chi(M) = c(\sigma) - c(\alpha) + c(\phi) = 2-2g$$

where $c(\pi)$ counts the number of cycles in the [[permutation#via_cycle_decompositions|cyclic decomposition]] of $\pi$ (i.e., the number of $\pi$-[[orbits]]).

### Hypermaps and constellations

The definition given above of oriented combinatorial map may be generalized in several directions.  A small generalization is to drop the requirement that $\alpha$ be [[fixed point]] free, while keeping the requirement that it be an [[involution]] (i.e., that $\alpha^2 = id$).  This can be seen as allowing the possibility for the graph to include "dangling edges".  In particular, every $\alpha$-[[orbit]] has length 2 or 1, with orbits of length 2 representing complete edges and orbits of length 1 representing dangling edges.  Although it might seem like a very small step, this generalization turns out to be useful for defining _rooted_ maps (see below).

As a bigger step, it is possible to drop condition (3) altogether:

+-- {: .num_definition #vinv}
###### Definition
An **oriented combinatorial hypermap** is a set $D$ equipped with a triple of [[permutations]] $(\sigma,\alpha,\phi)$ on $D$ such that:

1. the [[subgroup]] $\langle \sigma,\alpha,\phi\rangle$ of $Aut(D)$ generated by the permutations acts [[transitive action|transitively]] on $D$;

1. the composition of the permutations is the identity: $\phi\alpha\sigma = id$.
=--

A combinatorial hypermap gives a representation of a topological embedding of a [[hypergraph]] in a connected oriented surface, but (as first noted by Walsh) this turns out to be equivalent to an embedding of an ordinary graph equipped with a [[graph coloring|2-coloring]] of the vertices -- say, in black and white -- such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. (Such a graph is necessarily [[bipartite]].) The permutations $\sigma$ and $\alpha$ represent the cycles around the black and white vertices, respectively, while $\phi$ as before represents the faces.  Any ordinary map with all black vertices can be turned into hypermap by adding a white vertex in the middle of each edge (this goes well with the view of darts as half-edges), and from that perspective, the definition of hypermap simply correspond to lifting the restriction that white vertices have degree 2.

Both of these generalizations of the standard notion of combinatorial map are studied in the literature on so-called [[dessins d'enfants]], sometimes using the following terminology to distinguish the different cases:

* $\alpha$ is a fixed point free involution : "clean dessin"

* $\alpha$ is an involution : "pre-clean dessin"

* no conditions on $\alpha$ (besides (1) and (2) above): "dessin"

Another line of generalization is to consider an arbitrary number of permutations (rather than only three).  This more general notion of hypermap is called a "constellation" in [Lando & Zvonkin](#LandoZvonkin04).

+-- {: .num_definition #vinv}
###### Definition
A **k-constellation** is a set $D$ equipped with a $k$-[[tuple]] of [[permutations]] $\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_k$ on $D$ such that:

1. the [[subgroup]] $\langle \alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_k\rangle$ of $Aut(D)$ generated by the permutations acts [[transitive action|transitively]] on $D$;

1. the composition of the permutations is the identity: $\alpha_k\dots\alpha_1 = id$.
=--

The definition of the genus of a combinatorial map may be generalized appropriately to hypermaps and constellations.

### Fixed vertex/edge/face degrees

If one adds, say, the condition that

* $\sigma^3 = id$ and $\sigma$ has no fixed points

to the definition of oriented combinatorial map, then the resulting class of permutations represent embeddings of _trivalent_ graphs, i.e., where every vertex has degree 3.  Dually, placing the condition that

* $\phi^3 = id$ and $\phi$ has no fixed points

gives a way of representing arbitrary [[triangulations]] of oriented surfaces.  Analogous to what we saw above in the case of the edge involution $\alpha$, dropping the condition that $\sigma$ or $\phi$ be fixed point free also allows for the possibility of degenerate vertices/faces of degree 1.

More generally, we can say (following [Jones and Singerman 94](#JonesSingerman94)) that a hypermap has type $(p,q,r)$ if $p$, $q$, and $r$ are the [[least common multiple]]s of the degrees of the hypervertices, hyperedges, and hyperfaces, respectively.  This topological condition translates to the algebraic condition that the permutations $\sigma$, $\alpha$, and $\phi$ have [[order#in_the_sense_of_group_theory|order]]s $p$, $q$, and $r$ respectively.

## Monodromy group and the category of oriented maps

In this section we will adopt the more liberal notion of oriented combinatorial map described above, for which the involution $\alpha$ is allowed to have fixed points.  We will also sometimes write ``map'' as shorthand for ``oriented combinatorial map'' in this more liberal sense.

For a given map $M = (D,(\sigma,\alpha,\phi))$, the subgroup $\langle \sigma,\alpha,\phi\rangle$ of $Aut(D)$ is called the _[[monodromy]] group_ $Mon(M)$ of $M$. ([Lando & Zvonkin](#LandoZvonkin04) call this the _cartographic group_ of $M$, but it seems more common to reserve that name for a specific monodromy group, that of the "universal map": see [[cartographic group]].)  Note that a homomorphism of maps $h : M \to M'$ as defined above is the same thing as a morphism between the actions of the monodromy groups,

$$\array{D \times Mon(M) & \to & D\\
  ^{h\times (-)'}\downarrow && \downarrow^h\\
  D' \times Mon(M')& \to & D'}$$

where $(-)' : Mon(M) \to Mon(M')$ is the group homomorphism sending the generators $\sigma$, $\alpha$, and $\phi$ of $Mon(M)$ to the respective generators $\sigma'$, $\alpha'$, and $\phi'$ of $Mon(M')$.

The fact that $Mon(M)$ acts transitively on the set of darts $D$ corresponds to the topological condition that the graph represented by $M$ is connected.  This places strong restrictions on possible morphisms between maps:

+-- {: .num_thm}
###### Proposition
A morphism $h : M \to M'$ of oriented combinatorial maps is entirely determined by the choice of a dart $d_1 \in D$ and its image $h(d_1) \in D'$.  
=--

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 

Let $d_2 \in D$.  By assumption of transitivity, there exists a word $w \in \langle \sigma,\alpha,\phi \rangle$ such that $d_2 = w * d_1$.  Hence $h(d_2) = h(w* d_1) = w' * h(d_1)$.

=--

The category of oriented combinatorial maps was introduced (perhaps for the first time) by [Jones and Singerman 78](#JonesSingerman78), where it is called $AM$ (standing for ``algebraic map'').
We note that the following property of $AM$ relies crucially on taking the more liberal notion of map, which allows $\alpha$ to include fix points.

+-- {: .num_thm}
###### Proposition
The set $1 = \{ * \}$ equipped with a triple of identity permutations $\sigma = \alpha = \phi = id_1$ is a map, and is a [[terminal object]] in $AM$.
