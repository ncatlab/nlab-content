#Idea

* A strict $3$-category is a [[directed n-graph|directed 3-graph]] equipped with a composition operation on adjacent cells (of all levels) which is strictly unital and associative.

* The concept of a strict $3$-category is the simplest generalization of a [[category]] to a [[3-category]]. It is the one-step [[vertical categorification|categorification]] of the concept of a [[strict 2-category]].

#Definition

A __strict $3$-category__, often called simply a _3-category_, is a [[enriched category|category enriched over]] $\Str2\Cat$, the category of strict $2$-categories.  Similarly, a [[strict 3-groupoid]] is a [[groupoid]] enriched over [[strict 2-groupoid]]s.

These are also called [[geometric shapes for higher structures|globular]] strict $3$-categories and $3$-groupoids, to emphasise the underlying geometry.

#Remarks

* A strict $3$-category is the same as a [[strict omega-category]] which is trivial in degree $j \geq 4$.

* This is to be contrasted with a _weak $3$-category_ called a [[tricategory]] and a _semistrict $3$-category_ called a [[Gray-category]].
