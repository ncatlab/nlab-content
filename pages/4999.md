## Idea

The term _modal logic_ refers to an enrichment of standard formal [[logic]] by certain extra operations. What exactly this entails is not universally formalized. For instance in the preface to ([Blackburn-deRijke-Venema](#BlackburnDeRijkeVenema)) et al.) it says

>_'Ask three modal logicians what modal logic is, and you are likely to get at least three different answers'_.

But the following points are usually considered.

* In modal logics, the usual logical operations ([[and]], [[or]], [[not]], and perhaps [[universal quantifier|forall]], etc.) are accompanied by more operators -- usually called _modalities_ -- that try to express the idea that some propositions may be [[true]] (only) "*in a certain way*". 

  The classic example is a system that aims to model the idea of propositions being "possibly true" or "necessarily true". Notice, however, that the notions of possibility and necessity have different senses in ordinary language. For example, if I say '$P$ is possible', I may mean that $P$ is: *epistemically* possible, not ruled out by anything I know; *physically* possible, not ruled out by the laws of physics; *logically* possible, not ruled out by the laws of logic. Some suggest that there is a further type of possibility, *metaphysical* possibility intermediate between logical and physical possibility. Metaphysical possibility would allow that different laws of physics might apply. 

Epistemic modalities are captured in 'epistemic' modal logic, where necessity is interpreted as saying _"I know that proposition $\phi$ is true"_, and in 'provability logic', the basic modal operator interprets  as _"it is provable that $\phi$"_. If we have the basic temporal logic, then there is a future truth operator, so that $F\phi$ is intended to mean _"$\phi$ will be true at some future time"_, and also a past operator $P$ so $P\phi$ is intended to mean "$\phi$ was true at some past time". 

* Modal logics are built on **modal languages**, that is the usual propositional language plus those extra modalities. The way the modalities work has to be laid down in an axiom system for the logic in question, for instance, for the temporal logic we might require an axiom saying
'If $F F\phi$ is true, then $f\phi$ is true', which will read a 'if it is going be true in the future that $\phi$ is going to be true in the future, then ...', see [[temporal logic]].  (Is this going to be something what we might want in 'provability logic'; is it the case that we should expect that if it is provable that something is provable then that something must be itself provable. This concentrates the modelling process on exactly how we wish to have our 'context' to behave.) In this way the relational nature of a context that we are looking at can get encoded into the logic.


* Modal logics are thus also the logics of [[relational structures]], in fact,   Blackburn et al (see references) have as their first slogan: **Modal languages are simple but expressive languages for talking about relational structures.**
The temporal logic that satisfies the axiom $(4)$ has models that are [[posets]], for instance, whilst many of the [[epistemic logics]] have models which are sets with equivalence relations on them. In each case, the idea is that the relational structure gives all the possible states of some system and the modal logic describes that system. This explains the great interest in computer science and artificial intelligence of applications of modal logics.



It is usual to classify modal logics using their axiom systems, but also in terms of the type of general interpretation applied to them, such as :

*  [[temporal logic|temporal logics]];

*  [[epistemic logics]];

*  [[dynamic logic]];

*  [[arrow structures|arrow logics]];

*  [[provability logics]]

(this list may get added to later).

Modal logics have semantics given in terms of [[frame (modal logic)|Kripke frames]], which are simply [[relational structures]]. For instance, as we said above,  [[temporal logic|temporal logics]] have [[posets]] as models.



## Modal Languages
{#modal+language}

Modal languages add one or more modal operator, often denoted $\square$ or $\Diamond$ into the usual propositional logics. (For the moment, we will keep things fairly simple so assume these to  be unary operators and we will not be considering operators that have more than one input, for the moment at least. The general case will be considered later on, but in any case is discussed in detail in some of the books on modal logic listed below.)

We will give a modal language with $n$ modal operators, $\Diamond_i$, $i = 1,\ldots, n$, which can  be applied to propositions of the language to form new propositions.  If $n=1$, we will refer to the language, defined below,  as the _basic modal language_.

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

We suppose given a set of variables, the _$n$-operator basic modal language_, $\mathcal{L}_\omega(n)$, given by  

$$\phi ::= p_\lambda \mid \bot \mid \neg \phi \mid \phi_1 \vee \phi_2 \mid \Diamond_i\phi,$$  

where the $p_\lambda$ are the propositional variables ordered by finite ordinals, $\lambda$, and, as usual, $\Diamond_i$ is a modality for each  $i=1, \ldots , n$.  

=--


### Gloss

1. This form of definition needs a bit of interpreting if you have not met it before.  It gives a way of deciding if a formula is 'well-formed'.  The well formed formulae of  $\mathcal{L}_\omega(n)$ are defined as follows: A formula is either

   * a proposition variable, 

   * the propositional constant $\bot$, that is _falsum_, 

   * a negated formula,

   * a disjunction of two formulae, or

   * a formula prefixed by one of the diamonds / modal operators.

2. The basic modal language will be $\mathcal{L}_\omega(1)$.  We will sometimes write $Prop$ for the set of propositional variables / atomic formulae or whatever other reasonable term is used in a context.

3. The interpretation of $\Diamond \phi$ depends on the context (to some extent), but in the initial form here it is usually said to mean 'possibly $\phi$'.

4. Some authors use an equivalent generation rule using $\square \phi$, which is $\neg \Diamond \neg \phi$. Of course, this interprets as 'necessarily $\phi$' in this initial form.  In [[epistemic logic]] the basic modal language interprets $\square \phi$ as saying 'the agent knows that $\phi$'.

5. Other formulations replace $\vee$ and $\neg$ by implication $\phi_1\to \phi_2$, or by $\wedge$ and $\neg$.


## Modal logics

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

A **modal logic** in $\mathcal{L}_\omega(n)$ is any set $\Lambda$ of $\mathcal{L}_\omega(n)$-formulae such that   

* $\Lambda$ includes all $\mathcal{L}_\omega(n)$-formulae that are instances of tautologies, 
 
and

* $\Lambda$ is closed under the inference rule 
_if $\phi$, $\phi\to \psi \in \Lambda$ then $\psi \in \Lambda$_ , i.e. detachment or __modus ponens__.

### Modal Logics exist

As the set of all formulae in $\mathcal{L}_\omega(n)$ satisfies the conditions for a logic and any intersection of logics is itself also a logic, we have that given a set of formulae decreed to be 'axioms' for a logic, there is a smallest modal logic containing them.
 
One of the basic axiom systems leads to [[normal modal logic]]s. 
 

## Deducibility

Suppose given a [[normal modal logic]], $\Lambda$ in $\mathcal{L}_\omega(n)$.  A formula $\phi$ is **$\Lambda$-deducible** from a set, $\Gamma$ of formulae, if there are finitely many formulae $\psi_0,\ldots,\psi_m\in \Gamma$ such that 

$$\vdash_\Lambda (\psi_0\to (\psi_1\to (\ldots \to (\psi_m\to \phi)\ldots)$$

that is the formula $(\psi_0\to (\psi_1\to (\ldots \to (\psi_m\to \phi)\ldots)$ is in $\Lambda$.


## Semantics

### Kripke frames

The usual semantics of modal languages is in terms of [[frame (modal logic)|frames]], and this is where the link with relational structures comes in. (These are quite often called 'Kripke frames' as Kripke was one of the first to use relational semantics in this context. 

A discussion of the history can be found in  ([BlackburnDeRijkeVenema, page 42](#BlackburnDeRijkeVenema)). 

(As there is another sense to [[frame]] as the dual of a [[locale]], we need to consider the terminology here and where necessary will use [[frame (modal logic)]] as the entry name.) A more detailed discussion of [[frame (modal logic)|frames]], models and the whole question of the semantics of modal logics is to be found at that entry. 

### Categorical semantics
 {#CategoricalSemantics}

Every [[category]] comes with its [[internal logic]]. Modal operators in this internal logic can at least sometimes be identified with (co)reflectors into specified [[reflective subcategory|(co)reflective subcategories]].

Examples for this are [[local toposes]] and [[cohesive toposes]]. See there for more details.
