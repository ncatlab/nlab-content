## Idea and definition

Condensed sets aim to provide a convenient setting
in the framework of [[homotopical algebra]] for working with algebraic objects that have some sort of a [[topological space|topology]] on them.

\begin{definition}
A _condensed set_ is a [[sheaf]] of sets on the [[pro-étale site]] of a point.
That is, a condensed set is a functor
$$ProfiniteSet^op \to Set$$
such that the natural maps
$$T(\emptyset)\to *$$
and
$$T(S\sqcup S')\to T(S)\times T(S')$$
are bijections for any [[profinite sets]] $S$ and $S'$,
whereas the natural [[fork]]
$$T(S)\to T(S')\rightrightarrows T(S'\times_S S')$$
is an [[equalizer]] for any surjection of [[profinite sets]] $S'\to S$.
\end{definition}

[Scholze, p.7](#Scholze) modifies this definition to deal with size issues. For any uncountable strong limit cardinal $\kappa$, the category of $\kappa$-condensed sets is the category of sheaves on the site of profinite sets of cardinality less than $\kappa$, with finite jointly surjective families of maps as covers. 

The category of condensed sets is the (large) colimit of the category of $\kappa$-condensed sets along the filtered poset of all uncountable strong limit cardinals $\kappa$.
