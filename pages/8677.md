Given a (possibly noncommutative) unital [[ring]] $R$ there are many situations when certain elements or matrices can be inverted in a universal way obtaining a new "localized" ring $S^{-1}R$; they are equipped with a localization map $R\to S^{-1}R$. We can typically invert elements in a left or right Ore subset $S\subset R$ or much more generally some multiplicative set or matrices ([[Cohn localization]]) etc. There are also some specific localizations like Martindale localizations in ring theory.
