## Idea

The (lower or upper) semicontinuous topology is a [[topological structure|topology]] on the [[real line]] (or a generalization thereof) such that a [[continuous function]] (from some [[topological space]] $X$) to the real line equipped with this semicontinuous topology is the same thing as a (lower or upper) [[semicontinuous map]] from $X$ to the real line.

Thus one replaces discussion of semicontinuous maps with continuous maps by using a different topological structure.


## Definition

Let $R$ be any [[linear order]]; think of the [[real line]] with its usual order.  For each [[element]] $a$ of $R$, consider the [[subsets]]

$$ L_a \coloneqq \{ x \in R \;|\; x \gt a \} ,$$
$$ R_a \coloneqq \{ x \in R \;|\; x \lt a \} .$$

###### Definitions

The __lower semicontinuous topology__ on $R$ is generated by the [[topological base|base]] (of open sets) given by the sets $L_a$; the __upper semicontinuous topology__ on $R$ is generated by the [[topological base|base]] (of open sets) given by the sets $U_a$.
