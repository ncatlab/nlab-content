## Idea

A [[homomorphism]] between [[schemes]] is said to be _(locally) of finite type_ it it behaves like a [[finite number|finite]] [[covering space]].

## For schemes

A morphism $f : X \to Y$ of [[schemes]] is **locally of finite type** if

* for every [[open cover]] $\{U_i \to Y\}$ by [[affine scheme]]s, $U_i \simeq Spec B_i$;

* and every cover $\{U_{i j_i} \to X\}$ by affine schemes $U_{i j_i} = A_{i j_i}$, fitting into a [[commuting diagram]] (this always exists, see [[coverage]])

  $$
    \array{
      U_{i j_i} &\to& U_i
      \\
      \downarrow && \downarrow
      \\
      X &\stackrel{f}{\to}& Y
    }
  $$

  for all $i,j$, 

we have that the morphism of algebras $B_i \to A_{i j}$ formally dual to $U_{i j} \to U_i$ exhibits $A_{i j}$ as a [[finitely generated algebra]] over $B_i$.

If for fixed $i$ the $j_i$ range only over a [[finite set]], then the morphism is said to be of **finite type**.
