## Idea

For a  [[field theory]] with [[boundary field theory|boundary]] the sector not containing boundaries is often called the corresponding _bulk field theory_.

For instance in [[AdS3-CFT2 and CS-WZW correspondence]] the [[Chern-Simons theory]] is the bulk field theory while the [[WZW model]] is the boundary field theory
