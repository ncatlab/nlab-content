
Let $\mathfrak{F}(A)$ and $\mathfrak{F}(B)$ be the [[reverse lattices of filters]] for the [[sets]] $A$ and $B$.

Then a __funcoid__ from $A$ to $B$ consists of [[functions]] $\alpha\colon \mathfrak{F}(A) \to \mathfrak{F}(B)$ and $\beta\colon \mathfrak{F}(B) \to \mathfrak{F}(A)$ such that
$$\forall\mathcal{X}\in\mathfrak{F}(A),\mathcal{Y}\in\mathfrak{F}(B): (\mathcal{Y}\sqcap\alpha \mathcal{X} \ne 0^{\mathfrak{F}(A)} \Leftrightarrow \mathcal{X}\sqcap\beta \mathcal{Y} \ne 0^{\mathfrak{F}(B)}).$$
That is, for every [[filter]] $\mathcal{X}$ on $A$ and every filter $\mathcal{Y}$ on $B$, the filter (on $B$) generated by the [[union]] of $\mathcal{Y}$ and $\alpha(\mathcal{X})$ is not the entire [[power set]] $\mathcal{P}(B)$ iff the filter (on $A$) generated by the union of $\mathcal{X}$ and $\beta(\mathcal{Y})$ is not the entire power set $\mathcal{P}(A)$.

The above formulation is due to [[Victor Porton]]. A slight reformulation is that funcoids can be seen as morphisms between certain types of [[Chu spaces]]. [[Todd Trimble]] has written some notes on funcoids from this point of view [here](http://ncatlab.org/toddtrimble/published/topogeny), where they are also shown to be equivalent to topogenous relations (see [[syntopogenous space]]) provided that the reflexivity condition is dropped. The category of endofuncoids and continuous functions, and the full subcategory of reflexive endofuncoids, are each [[topological functor|topological]] over $Set$. 

Funcoids were first named and studied by [[Victor Porton]], an independent researcher, as an approach to [[general topology]], in particular as a massive generalisation of [[proximity spaces]], [[pretopological spaces]], etc. -- somewhat along the same lines described at [[syntopogenous space]] where nearness notions are taken to be primitive.
