
Let $\mathfrak{F}(A)$ and $\mathfrak{F}(B)$ be the [[reverse lattices of filters]] for the [[sets]] $A$ and $B$.

Then a __funcoid__ from $A$ to $B$ consists of [[functions]] $\alpha\colon \mathfrak{F}(A) \to \mathfrak{F}(B)$ and $\beta\colon \mathfrak{F}(B) \to \mathfrak{F}(A)$ such that
$$\forall\mathcal{X}\in\mathfrak{F}(A),\mathcal{Y}\in\mathfrak{F}(B): \mathcal{Y}\sqcap\alpha \mathcal{X} \ne 0^{\mathfrak{F}(A)} \Leftrightarrow \mathcal{X}\sqcap\beta \mathcal{Y} \ne 0^{\mathfrak{F}(B)}.$$
That is, for every [[filter]] $\mathcal{X}$ on $A$ and every filter $\mathcal{Y}$ on $B$, the filter (on $B$) generated by the [[union]] of $\mathcal{Y}$ and $\alpha(\mathcal{X})$ is not the entire [[power set]] $\mathcal{P}(B)$, and the filter (on $A$) generated by the union of $\mathcal{X}$ and $\beta(\mathcal{Y})$ is not the entire power set $\mathcal{P}(A)$.

Funcoids are studied by [[Victor Porton]], an independent researcher, as an approach to [[general topology]], as a massive generalisation of [[proximity spaces]], [[pretopological spaces]], etc; no other mathematicians are known to work on them.  Of the regular [[Contributors|contributors]] to the $n$Lab, [[Toby Bartels]] thinks that there might be something to it.
