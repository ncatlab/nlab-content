## Idea

An _integral Wu structure_ in degree $2k$ on an [[orientation|oriented]] [[smooth manifold]] $X$  is a refinement of the [[Wu class]] $\nu_{2k} \in H^{2k}(X, \mathbb{Z}_2)$ by a [[cocycle]] $\phi$ in degree $2k$ [[ordinary differential cohomology]] $H^{2k}_{diff}(X)$, hence a [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle (2k-1)-bundle with connection]] whose underlying higher [[Dixmier-Douady class]] equals $\nu_{2k} mod 2$.

## Definition


## Properties

### In terms of smooth $\infty$-stacks

Integral Wu structures have a natural formulation in the [[(∞,1)-topos]]  [[Smooth∞Grpd]] as follows.

If we read the defining expression for the collection of $\nu_{2k}$ integral Wu structures 

$$
  \hat \mathbf{Wu}_{\nu_{2k}}
  \coloneqq
  \left\{
    \phi \in \mathbf{B}^{2k-1} U(1)_{conn}
    |
    (\phi \simeq \nu_{2k} mod 2)
  \right\}
$$

in [[homotopy type theory]], its [[categorical semantics]] is given by the [[homotopy pullback]] of [[moduli ∞-stacks]]


$$
  \array{
     \hat \mathf{Wu}_{\nu_{2k}} &\to& [X,\mathbf{B}^{2k-1} U(1)_{conn}]
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     * &\stackrel{\nu_{2k}}{\to}& [X, \mathbf{B}^{2k} \mathbb{Z}_2]
  }
  \,.
$$
