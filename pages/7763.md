## Defintion

A _differential integral Wu structure_ in degree $2k$ on an [[orientation|oriented]] [[smooth manifold]] $X$  is a refinement of the [[Wu class]] $\nu_{2k} \in H^{2k}(X, \mathbb{Z}_2)$ $\nu_{2k}$ by a [[cocycle]] $\phi$ in degree $2k$ [[ordinary differential cohomology]] $H^{2k}_{diff}(X)$, hence a [[circle n-bundle with connection|circle (2k-1)-bundle with connection]] $\nabla_{2k-1}$ whose underlying higher [[Dixmier-Douady class]] $DD(\nabla_{2k-1})$ equals $\nu_{2k}$ modulo 2-reduction

$$
  DD(\nabla_{2k-1}) mod 2 = \nu_{2k} \in H^{2k}(X, \mathbb{Z}_2)
  \,.
$$
