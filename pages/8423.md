# Tychonoff product
* table of contents
{: toc}

## Idea

The _Tychonoff product_ (named for [[Andrey Tikhonov]]) is simply the [[product]] in the [[category]] [[Top]] of [[topological spaces]] and [[continuous maps]].

It is the usual notion of 'product' of topological spaces, but should be distinguished from the [[box product]], which is sometimes useful.  (They are the same for [[finite products]].)


## Definitions

Let $(X_i)_i$ be a [[family]] of [[topological spaces]].  Consider the [[cartesian product]] $\prod_i {|X_i|}$ of the [[underlying sets]] of these spaces.  This [[set]] comes with [[projection map]]s $\pi_i\colon \prod_j {|X_j|} \to X_i$.

###### Definitions

The __Tychonoff topology__ or __product topology__ on $\prod_i {|X_i|}$ is the [[initial topology]] generated by the $\pi_i$.  The __Tychonoff product__ or __topological product__ or simply __product__ of the spaces $X_i$ is the set $\prod_i {|X_i|}$ equipped with the Tychonoff product topology.

## Properties

Of course, the maps $\pi_i$ are [[continuous maps]], so we have a [[cone]] in [[Top]].

###### Proposition

This is in fact a [[product]] cone in $Top$.
