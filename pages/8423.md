# Tychonoff product

## Idea

The _Tychonoff product_ (named for [[Andrey Tikhonov]]) is simply the [[product]] in the [[category]] [[Top]] of [[topological spaces]] and [[continuous maps]].

It is the usual notion of 'product' of topological spaces, but should be distinguished from the [[box product]], which is sometimes useful.  (They are the same for [[finite products]].)


## Definitions

Let $(X_i)_i$ be a [[family]] of [[topological spaces]].  Consider the [[cartesian product]] $\prod_i {|X_i|}$ of the [[underlying sets]] of these <spaces.  This [[set]] comes with [[projection map]]s $\pi_i\colon \prod_j {|X_j|} \to X_i$.

###### Definitions

The __Tychonoff topology__ or __product topology__ on $\prod_i {|X_i|}$ is the [[initial topology]] generated by the $\pi_i$.  The __Tychonoff product__ or __topological product__ or simply __product__ of the spaces $X_i$ is the set $\prod_i {|X_i|}$ equipped with the Tychonoff product topology.

## Properties

Of course, the maps $\pi_i$ are [[continuous maps]], so we have a [[cone]] in [[Top]].

###### Proposition

This is in fact a [[product]] cone in $Top$.

=--

By the general characterization of limits in [[Top]], see [here](#DescriptionOfLimitsAndColimitsInTop).

###### Proposition

The Tychonoff topology on $\prod_{i \in I} X_i$ is equivalently the topology 

* generated from the [[sub-basis for a topology|sub-basis]]

  $$
    \{ p_i^{-1}(U_i)| i \in I\,, U_i \in \tau_{X_i} \}
  $$

* generated from the [[basis of a topology|basis]]

  $$
    \{ \cap_{j \in J} \p_j^{-1}(U_j) | J \subset I \; finite \; subset \; and U_j \in \tau_{X_j}\}
    \,,
  $$

where $p_i \colon \prod_{j \in I} X_j \to X_i$ are the defining [[projection]] maps.

=--

In particular if $I$ itself is already finite, then a basis of the product topology is given by the Cartesian products of elements of a basis in the factors.
