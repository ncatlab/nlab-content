## Definition

A __Gabriel filter__ $G$ is a [[uniform filter]] of left ideals in a [[ring]] $R$ which is [[idempotent]] under [[Gabriel composition of filters]]. 

## Terminology

In our definition this notion is equivalent to [[topologizing filter]]; though for some authors the latter notion slightly differs. Stenstroem 
says Gabriel topology instead of Gabriel filter, because all Gabriel filters form a basis of nieghborhoods of $0$ for a topology on $R$. 

## Properties

If $L$ and $L'$ are left ideals in a Gabriel filter $F$, then the set $L L'$ (of all products $l l'$ where $l\in L, l'\in L'$) is an element on $F$. Any uniform filter $F$ is contained in a minimal Gabriel filter $G$ (said to be *generated by $F$*), namely the intersection of all Gabriel filters containing $F$. Given a Gabriel filter $G$, the class of all $G$-[[torsion]] modules (see [[uniform filter]]) is a hereditary torsion class.
