Classical mechanics is that part of [[classical physics]] dealing with the dynamics of point [[particle]]s and rigid bodies; compare [[continuum mechanics]], which deals with the dynamics of [[physical field]]s.

Zoran: I disagree. Classical mechanics is classical mechanics of anything: point particles, rigid bodies (the latter I already included), infinite systems (mechanics of strings, membranes, springs, elastic media, classical fields). The standard textbooks like Goldstein take it exactly in that generality.

One could even count the simplified beginning part of the specialized branches like aerodynamics and hydrodynamics (ideal liquids for example), which are usually studied in separate courses and which in full formulation are not just mechanical systems, as the thermodynamics also affects the dynamics. There are also mechanical models of dissipative systems, where the dissipative part is taken only phenomenologically, e.g. as friction terms. Hydrodynamics can also be considered as a part of rheology.

Mathematically, theoretical classical mechanics is a rather special case of the theory of [[dynamical system]]s.
