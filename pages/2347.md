Classical mechanics is that part of [[classical physics]] dealing with the dynamics of point [[particle]]s and rigid bodies; compare [[continuum mechanics]], which deals with the dynamics of [[physical field]]s.

Zoran: I disagree. Classical mechanics is classical mechanics of anything: point particles, rigid bodies (the latter I already included), infinite systems (mechanics of strings, membranes, springs, elastic media, classical fields). It includes statics, not only dynamics. The standard textbooks like Goldstein take it exactly in that generality.

One could even count the simplified beginning part of the specialized branches like aerodynamics and hydrodynamics (ideal liquids for example), which are usually studied in separate courses and which in full formulation are not just mechanical systems, as the thermodynamics also affects the dynamics. There are also mechanical models of dissipative systems, where the dissipative part is taken only phenomenologically, e.g. as friction terms. Hydrodynamics can also be considered as a part of rheology.

Nondissipative systems with finitely many degrees of freedom may be described geometrically using [[symplectic manifolds]], or more generally [[Poisson manifolds]]; the later may also sometimes appear as reductions of the systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom. 

Classical mechanics of a system of point particles and rigid bodies is usually divided into statics, kinematics and dynamics. Statics studies the balance of forces in a system which does not move, or in a stationary flow. Kinematics studies the relation between position, velocity and acceleration of bodies in a mechanical system, without reference to the causes of motion. Dynamics studies motion with reference to the causes of motion and interaction between bodies and its manifestation via (quantified) [[force]]s, energy and mass assigned to bodies in motion and interaction.

Mathematically, the (non-statics part of the) theoretical classical mechanics is a rather special case of the theory of [[dynamical system]]s which studies general spacially-parametrized systems in a (discrete or continuous) time evolution.
