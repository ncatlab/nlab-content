## Idea

Classical mechanics is that part of [[classical physics]] dealing with the deterministic physics of point [[particle]]s and rigid bodies; often the systems with the infinitely many degrees of freedom are also included (like infinite arrays of particles and their continuous limits like classical mechanics of strings, membranes, elastic media and of classical fields). For the continuous systems, the equations of motion can often be explained by the partial differential equations, describing classical [[physical field]]s of quantities (typically smooth possibly vector valued functions on manifolds), including background fields like metric; the latter (sub)area is the [[classical field theory]], but it is often studied separately from the classical mechanics of the finite systems of particles; especially if non-classical features or interpretations are involved (e.g. supersymmetry, or unusual case of non-variational  equations of motion etc.). In Hamiltonian reduction, due conservation laws, many systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom, reduce to the finite ones. 

Nondissipative systems with finitely many degrees of freedom may be described geometrically using [[symplectic manifolds]], or more generally [[Poisson manifolds]]; the later may also sometimes appear as reductions of the systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom. 

Classical mechanics of a system of point particles and rigid bodies is usually divided into statics, kinematics and dynamics. __Statics__ studies the balance of forces in a system which does not move, or in a stationary flow. __Kinematics__ studies the relation between position, velocity and acceleration of bodies in a mechanical system, without reference to the causes of motion. __Dynamics__ studies motion with reference to the causes of motion and interaction between bodies and its manifestation via (quantified) [[force]]s, energy and mass assigned to bodies in motion and interaction.

For a theoretical classical mechanics one often starts with a concrete system of bodies with pulleys, strings, spins, external and internal forces, and dissipative sinks and sources (e.g. friction forces), which are then analysed to get the configuration or phase space of the system, the equations of motion and possibly to determine some special [[observable]]s of interest. Once abstracted that way, the rest of the study is a rather special case of the theory of [[dynamical system]]s, which itself studies general (either deterministic or stochastic) spatially-parametrized systems in a (discrete or continuous) time evolution.

## Definition

We set up some basic notions of classical mechanics. 

### Classical mechanical systems

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

A _real [[Poisson algebra]]_ is a unital (commutative) [[associative algebra]] $(A, \dot)$ over the [[real number]]s that is equipped with with an additional bilinear operation

$$
  [-,-] : A \otimes_{\mathbb{R}} A \to A 
$$

that makes $A$ into a [[Lie algebra]] such that for each element $a \in A$ the operation $[a,-] : A \to A$ is a [[derivation]] of the product $\cdot : A \otimes A \to A$.

This definition is rarely used, but it makes sense also when $\cdot$ is not commutative. 
A _[[homomorphism]]_ $(A, \dot, [-,-]) \to (B, \cdot, [-,-])$ of Poisson algebras is a [[linear function]] $A \to B$ that respects both the associative product and the Lie bracket.

Write [[Poiss]] for the resulting category of (not necessarily commutative)
Poisson algebras. Write $CPoiss \subset Poiss$ for the [[full subcategory]] on those Poisson algebras whose underlying [[associative algebra]] is commutative.

=--


+-- {: .num_defn #ClassMechSys}
###### Definition

The [[opposite category]] of that of commutative real Poisson algebras we call the category of **classical mechanical systems**

$$
  ClassMechSys := CPoiss^{op}
  \,.
$$ 

=--

+-- {: .num_example #ClassicalSystemFromPoissonManifold}
###### Example

For $(X, \{-,-\})$ a [[Poisson manifold]] or $(X, \omega)$ a [[symplectic manifold]], the algebra of [[smooth function]]s $C^\infty(X, \mathbb{R})$ is naturally a Poisson algebra, thus may be regarded as an object in $ClassMechSys$. For classical mechanical systems of this form, we say that the [[manifold]] $X$ is the [[phase space]] of the system.

Generally, therefore, for $(A, \cdot,[-,-])$ a Poisson algebra, we may regard it as a formal dual to some generalized Phase space.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

For $(A, \cdot, \{-,-\})$ a Poisson algebra, $A$ together with its [[module]] $\Omega^1(A)$ of [[KÃ¤hler differential]]s naturally form a [[Lie-Rinehart pair]], with bracket given by

$$
  [d a, d b ] := d \{a,b\}
  \,.
$$

If the Poisson algebra comes from a [[Poisson manifold]] $X$, then this Lie-Rinehart pair is the [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] of the given [[Poisson Lie algebroid]] over $X$. We can therefore identify classical mechanical systems over a phase space manifold also with Poisson Lie algebroids.

### Observables and states

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Given $S := (A,\cdot, \{-,-\})$ a classical mechanical system, we say

* an **[[observable]]** of $S$ is an element $a \in A$, hence we call $A$ the **algebra of observables**;

* a **[[state]]** of $S$ is 

  * a [[linear function]] $\rho : A \to \mathbb{R}$;

  * which is **positive** in that for all $a \in A$ we have that

    $\rho(a \cdot a) \geq 0$.

* a **[[pure state]]** of $S$ is a state that is not only a linear map, but even an algebra homomorphism $\rho : A \to \mathbb{R}$.

Write $States((A, \cdot))$ for the set of states of $A$. 

For $\rho \in States$ and $a \in A$ we say that $\rho(a)$ is the **value of the observable $a$ on the system in state $\rho$**.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

If the classical mechanical system comes from a [[Poisson manifold]] $(X, \{-,-\})$ by 
example \ref{ClassicalSystemFromPoissonManifold}, then the pure states correspond precisely to the points of the manifold $X$. So each point of $X$ is one _specific_ (= "pure") state that the mechanical system defined by $(X, \{-,-\})$ can be in, whereas a general state $\rho : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is a distribution of such specific states.

=--

### Flows and evolution

Let $(A, \cdot, \{-,-\})$ be a classical mechanical system.

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

For any observable $a \in A$ we say that a **1-parameter flow induced by the observable** is, if it exists, an [[action]] of the [[real number]]s on the observables

$$
  F_a : \mathbb{R} \times A \to A
$$

which is [[differentiation|differentiable]] in $\mathbb{R}$ and satisfies for all $b \in A$ the [[differential equation]]

$$
  \frac{d}{d t} F_a(b) (t) = \{a,b\}
  \,.
$$

=--

In non-relativistic classical mechanics it makes sense to single out one element $H \in A$ and declare that the corresponding flow is the _time evolution_ of observables of the system. One calls this $H$ the **[[Hamiltonian]]** or **energy** observable of the system.

### Quantization

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

Write $StarAlg_{\mathbb{C}}$ for the category of [[star-algebra]]s over the [[complex number]]s. 

The [[opposite category]]

$$
  QuantMechSys := StarAlg^{op}
$$

we call the category of **[[quantum mechanical systems]]**.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For $(A, \cdot, \{-,-\})$ a classical mechanical system, 
def. \ref{ClassMechSys}, a **[[quantization]]** of it is -- if it exists --

* a 1-parameter [[field of star-algebras]] $\{A_\hbar\}_{\hbar \in [0,\infty)}$;

* such that in the limit $\hbar \to 0$ we have

  1. $A_\hbar \to A_0 := A \otimes_{\mathbb{R}}\mathbb{C}$;

  1. for all $a,b \in A_{\hbar}$: $\frac{1}{i \hbar } [a,b] = \{a,b\}$.

Conversely, given a quantum mechanical system $(A, \ast)$ and a field of star-algebras such that $A = A_1$, then we call the clasical system $A_0$ its (or rather: a)**[[classical limit]]**.
