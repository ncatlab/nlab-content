__Several complex variables__ is a well-established common name for [[function theory]]/[[analytic geometry]]/[[potential theory]] in several complex variables, i.e. the study of [[complex manifold]]s of finite even [[dimension]] $d \gt 2$ as well as some generalizations like [[complex space]]s. 

The study of several complex variables is qualitatively much different from the theory of functions of one complex variable: for example, natural (inextendable) domains of holomorphy are not at all what one might guess based on the one-variable case ([[Hartogs lemma]]), and similarly for the question of when two domains are biholomorphic. More subtle geometric conditions such as [[pseudoconvexity]] come to the fore.
