## Idea

A [[differential equation]] ([[ordinary differential equation|ordinary]] or [[partial differential equation|partial]]) is called _linear_ if the [[linear combination]] of any of its [[solutions]] is still a [[solution]], hence if its space of solutions is a _[[vector space]]_.

Equivalently this means that the [[differential operator]] that corresponds to the differential equation is a [[linear operator]].

Linear differential equations may be analyzed via [[harmonic analysis]] by applying [[Fourier transform]] to decompose solutions as [[superpositions]] of [[plane wave]] "harmonics" (e.g. [H&#246;rmander 90](#Hoermander90)).

In [[physics]] a [[field theory]] whose [[equations of motion]] is a linear partial differential equation is called a _[[free field theory]]_.

Where a general (possibly non-linear) differential equation is equivalently an object in the [[slice category]] over the [[de Rham shape]] of the space of its [[free variables]], a linear differential equation is more specifically a linear object in this slice. In the context of [[algebraic geometry]] these are the _[[D-modules]]_.

## Examples

* [[wave equation]]

* [[Dirac equation]]

* [[Klein-Gordon equation]]

* [[Schrödinger equation]]

* [[Tomonaga-Schwinger equation]]

* ...
