The *[Center for Quantum and Topological Systems](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/research/faculty-labs-and-projects/center-for-quantum-and-topological-systems.html)* (CQTS)  is a Research Center, launching in 2022, within the [Research Institute](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/research/research-institute-centers.html) of [New York University in Abu Dhabi](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/).

[CQTS](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/research/faculty-labs-and-projects/center-for-quantum-and-topological-systems.html) hosts cross-disciplinary research on *[[topological physics -- contents|topological]] [[quantum systems]]*,  such as [[topological phases of matter]] understood [[AdS-CFT in condensed matter physics|via holography]] and using tools from [[topological data analysis]], ultimately aimed at addressing open questions in [[topological quantum computation]]. A unifying theme is the use of new methods from ("[[persistent cohomotopy|persistent]]") *[[Cohomotopy]]* and [[generalized cohomology]]-theory, developed [[schreiber:Hypothesis H|in high energy physics]].

    **Persistent homotopy groups of metric spaces**

    \linebreak

    > By capturing both geometric and topological features of datasets, [[persistent homology]] has shown its promise in applications. Motivated by the fact that [[homotopy]] in general contains more information than [[homology]], we study notions of [[persistent homotopy]] groups of compact [[metric spaces]], together with their stability properties in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense. Under fairly mild assumptions on the spaces, we proved that the classical [[fundamental group]] has an underlying tree-like structure (i.e. a dendrogram) and an associated ultrametric. We then exhibit pairs of filtrations that are confounded by [[persistent homology]] but are distinguished by their [[persistent homotopy]] groups. We finally describe the notion of persistent [[rational homotopy theory|rational]] homotopy groups, which is easier to handle but still contains extra information compared to persistent homology.

    **Realisations of Posets**

    \linebreak

    > My presentation  is based on an article with the same title coauthored with A. Jin and F. Tombari  ([arXiv:2112.12209](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12209)).

    > Encoding information in form of  [[functors]] indexed by the [[poset]] of $r$-tuples of real numbers ([[persistence modules]]) is attractive for three reasons: 
       
    > a) metric properties  of the poset are essential  to study  distances on persistence modules

    > b) the poset of $r$-tuples of real numbers has well behaved discrete  approximations which are  used  to provide finite  approximations of  persistence modules 
       
    > c) the mentioned discretizations and approximations  have well studied algebraic and homological properties as they can be identified with  multi graded modules over polynomial rings.

    > In my talk I will describe a construction called realisation, that transforms arbitrary posets into posets  which satisfy all three requirements above and hence  are particularly suitable for persistence methods.Intuitively the realisation associates a continuous structure to a locally discrete poset by filling in empty spaces. For example the realisation of the poset of natural numbers is the poset of non negative reals. I will focus on illustrating how homological techniques, such as Koszul complexes, can be used to study persistent modules indexed by realisations.

    **Homotopical and sheaf theoretic point of view on multi-parameter persistence. **

    \linebreak

    >  In this talk we will highlight the study of [[level set]] [[persistent homology|persistence]] through the prism of [[sheaf theory]] and a special type of 2-parameter persistence: Mayer-Vietoris systems and a pseudo-symetry between those. This is based on [joint work with Berkouk and Oudot](persistent+homology#BerkoukGinotOudot19).

    **Thoughts on big data sets**

    \linebreak

    > This talk describes work in progress. The idea is to develop methods for analyzing a very large data sets $X \subset \mathbb{R}^{N}$ in high dimensional spaces. There are well-known pitfalls to avoid, including the inability to computationally analyze [[TDA]] constructions for $X$ on account of its size, the "curse of high dimensionality", and the failure of [[excision]] for standard [[TDA]] constructions. We discuss the curse of high dimensionality and define a hypercube metric on $\mathbb{R}^{N}$ that may lessen its effects. The excision problem for the [[Vietoris-Rips complex|Vietoris-Rips construction]] can be addressed by expanding the [[TDA]] discussion to [[filtered object|filtered]] subobjects $K$ of Vietoris-Rips constructions. Unions of such subobjects satisfy excision in path components (clusters) and [[homology groups]], by classical results. The near-term goal is to construct, for each data point $x$, a "computable" filtered subcomplex $K_{x} \subset V(X)$ with $x \in K_{x}$, which would capture spatial local behaviour of the data set $X$ near $x$. A large (but highly parallelizable) algorithm finds a nearest neighbour, or a set of $k$-nearest neighbours for a fixed data point $x \in X$. Some variant of this algorithm may lead to a good construction of the local subcomplex $K_{x}$.
