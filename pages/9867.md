## Idea

Where a [[homology theory]] is a [[covariant functor]] and a [[cohomology theory]] is a [[contravariant functor]] on some [[category]] of [[spaces]], a _bivariant cohomology theory_ is a [[bifunctor]], hence a functor of two variables, contravariant in the first, and covariant in the second.

## Axiomatization in homotopy theory
 {#AxiomatizazionInHomotopyTheory}

Here are some notes on a proposal for how to formalize this usefully. (Aspects of this appear in ([Nuiten 13]{#Nuiten}).

Let $E$ be an [[E-∞ ring]], write $GL_1(E)$ for its [[∞-group of units]]. Write $\mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}GL_1(E)}$ for the [[slice (∞,1)-topos]] over the [[delooping]] of this [[abelian ∞-group]]. This is the [[(∞,1)-category]] of [[spaces]] equipped with [[(∞,1)-module bundle|(∞,1)-line bundles]] over $E$. Consider an [[(∞,1)-functor]] 

$$
  \Gamma \;\colon \; \mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}GL_1(E)} \to E Mod
$$

to the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-modules]] over $E$, which form $E$-modules of co-sections of $E$-[[(∞,1)-module bundles]] (generalized [[Thom spectra]]).

###### Defintiion

For $\chi_i \colon X_i \to \mathbf{B}GL_1(E)$ two [[objects]] of $\mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}GL_1(E)}$, the $(\chi_1,\chi_2)$-[[twisted cohomology|twisted]] bivariant $E$-cohomology on $(X_1,X_2)$ is 

$$
  Hom_{E Mod}\left(\Gamma_{X_1}\left(\chi_1\right), \Gamma_{X_2}\left(\chi_2\right)\right)
  \in 
  E Mod
  \,.
$$

###### Example

By the general discussion at [[twisted cohomology]], following ([ABG, def. 5.1](#ABG)) we have

* for $X_2 = \ast$ the point, the above bivariant cohomology is the $\chi_1$-twisted $E$-cohomology of $X_1$;

* for $X_1 = \ast$ the point, the above bivariant cohomology is the $\chi_2$-twisted $E$-[[generalized homology|homology]] of $X_2$.

###### Example

[[KK-theory]] is meant to be a model for bivariant twisted [[topological K-theory]]. Indeed, according to ([Joachim-Stolz 09, around p. 4](#JoachimStolz09)) the category $KK$ first of all is naturally a an [[enriched category]] $\mathbb{KK}$ of the category $\mathcal{S}$ of [[symmetric spectra]]  and as such comes with a symmetric monoidal enriched functor

$$
  \mathbb{KK} \to KU Mod
  \,.
$$
