## Idea

Where a [[homology theory]] is a [[covariant functor]] and a [[cohomology theory]] is a [[contravariant functor]] on some [[category]] of [[spaces]], a _bivariant cohomology theory_ is a [[bifunctor]], hence a functor of two variables, contravariant in the first, and covariant in the second.

## Examples

* In [[noncommutative topology]]: [[KK-theory]].

* In [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]]: [[bivariant algebraic K-theory]], [[noncommutative motives]].
