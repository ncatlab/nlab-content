## Idea

The notion of $(\infty,1)$-monad is the [[vertical categorification]] of that of [[monad]] from the context of [[category|categories]] to that of [[(∞,1)-category|(∞,1)-categories]]. 

They relate to [[(∞,1)-adjunctions]] as [[monads]] relate to [[adjunctions]].

## Properties

### Homotopy coherence
 {#HomotopyCoherence}

An [[(∞,1)-adjunction]] is uniquely determined already by its image in the
[[homotopy 2-category]] ([Riehl-Verity 13, theorem 5.4.14](#RiehlVerity13)). This is not in general true for $(\infty,1)$-monads: these being [[monoids in an (∞,1)-category]] of [[endomorphisms]], they in general have [[coherence]] data all the way up in degree. However, by the previous statement, those $(\infty,1)$-monads which arise from [[(∞,1)-adjunctions]] are determined by less coherence data ([Riehl-Verity 13, page 6](#RiehlVerity13)). This should justify the [[simplicial model category]]-theoretic discussion in ([Hess 10](#Hess10)) in [[(∞,1)-category theory]].
