## Idea

The notion of $(\infty,1)$-monad is the [[vertical categorification]] of that of [[monad]] from the context of [[category|categories]] to that of [[(∞,1)-category|(∞,1)-categories]]. 

They relate to [[(∞,1)-adjunctions]] as [[monads]] relate to [[adjunctions]].

## Properties



### Barr-Beck monadicity theorem

+-- {: .num_prop #CanonicalMonadicAdjunction}
###### Proposition

Given an [[(∞,1)-monad]] $T$ on an [[(∞,1)-category]]
$\mathcal{C}$, there is an [[(∞,1)-adjunction]]

$$
  (F \dashv U)
  \;\colon\;
  Alg_{\mathcal{C}}(T)
  \stackrel{\overset{F}{\leftrightarrow}}{\underset{U}{\longrightarrow}}
  \mathcal{C}
  \,,
$$

where $Alg_{\mathcal{C}}(T)$ is the (Eilenberg-Moore) [[(∞,1)-category of algebras over an (∞,1)-monad|(∞,1)-category of algebras over the (∞,1)-monad]] and where $U$ is the [[forgetful functor]] that remembers the underlying [[object]] of $\mathcal{C}$.

This appears in ([Riehl-Verity 13, def. 6.1.14](#RiehlVerity13)).

The following is the refinement to [[(∞,1)-category theory]] of the classical [[Barr-Beck monadicity theorem]] which states sufficient conditions for recognizing an [[(∞,1)-adjunction]] as being canonically [[equivalence|equivalent]] to the one in prop. \ref{CanonicalMonadicAdjunction}, hence to be a _[[monadic adjunction]]_.

###### Theorem

Let $(L \dashv R)$ a pair of [[adjoint (∞,1)-functors]] such that

1. $R$ is a [[conservative (∞,1)-functor]];

1. the [[domain]] [[(∞,1)-category]] of $R$ admits [[geometric realization]] ([[(∞,1)-colimit]]) of [[simplicial objects in an (∞,1)-category|simplicial objects]];

1. and $R$ preserves these

then for $T \coloneqq R \circ L$ the essentially unique $(\infty,1)$-monad structure on the composite endofunctor, there is an [[equivalence of (∞,1)-categories]] identifying the [[domain]] of $R$ with the [[(∞,1)-category of algebras over an (∞,1)-monad]] $Alg_{\mathcal{C}}(T)$ over $T$ and $R$ itself as the canonical [[forgetful functor]] $U$ from prop. \ref{CanonicalMonadicAdjunction}.

This appears as ([[Higher Algebra|Higher Algebra, theorem 6.2.0.6, theorem 6.2.2.5]], [Riehl-Verity 13, section 7](#RiehlVerity13))

### Homotopy coherence
 {#HomotopyCoherence}

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

An [[(∞,1)-adjunction]] $(L \dashv R) \colon \mathcal{C} \leftrightarrow \mathcal{D}$ is uniquely determined already by its image in the [[homotopy 2-category]] ([Riehl-Verity 13, theorem 5.4.14](#RiehlVerity13)). This is not in general true for $(\infty,1)$-monads $T \colon \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}$. As these are [[monoids in an (∞,1)-category]] of [[endomorphisms]], they in general have relevant [[coherence]] data all the way up in degree. However, by the previous statement and the monadicity theorem \ref{InfinityBarrBeckTheorem}, for $(\infty,1)$-monads given via specified [[(∞,1)-adjunctions]] as $T \simeq R \circ L$ are determined by less (further) coherence data ([[Higher Algebra|Higher Algebra, remark 6.2.0.7, prop. 6.2.2.3]], [Riehl-Verity 13, page 6](#RiehlVerity13)). (Of course there is, instead, extra data/information carried by the choice of $\mathcal{D}$.) This should justify the [[simplicial model category]]-theoretic discussion in ([Hess 10](#Hess10)) in [[(∞,1)-category theory]].
