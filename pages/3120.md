## Idea

The notion of $(\infty,1)$-monad is the [[vertical categorification]] of that of [[monad]] from the context of [[category|categories]] to that of [[(∞,1)-category|(∞,1)-categories]]. 

They relate to [[(∞,1)-adjunctions]] as [[monads]] relate to [[adjunctions]].

## Properties




### Homotopy coherence
 {#HomotopyCoherence}

An [[(∞,1)-adjunction]] is uniquely determined already by its image in the
[[homotopy 2-category]] ([Riehl-Verity 13, theorem 5.4.14](#RiehlVerity13)). This is not in general true for $(\infty,1)$-monads: these being [[monoids in an (∞,1)-category]] of [[endomorphisms]], they in general have relevant [[coherence]] data all the way up in degree. However, by the previous statement and theorem \ref{InfinityBarrBeckTheorem}, for $(\infty,1)$-monads given as arising from specified [[(∞,1)-adjunctions]] are determined by less (further) coherence data ([[Higher Algebra|Higher Algebra, remark 6.2.0.7, prop. 6.2.2.3]], [Riehl-Verity 13, page 6](#RiehlVerity13)). This should justify the [[simplicial model category]]-theoretic discussion in ([Hess 10](#Hess10)) in [[(∞,1)-category theory]].


### Barr-Beck monadicity theorem
 {#MonadicityTheorem}

###### Theorem

Let $(L \dashv R)$ a pair of [[adjoint (∞,1)-functors]] such that

1. $R$ is a [[conservative (∞,1)-functor]];

1. the [[domain]] [[(∞,1)-category]] of $R$ admits [[geometric realization]] ([[(∞,1)-colimit]]) of [[simplicial objects in an (∞,1)-category|simplicial objects]];

1. and $R$ preserves these

then for $T \coloneqq R \circ L$ the essentially unique $(\infty,1)$-endomorphism monad structure on the composite endofunctor, there is an [[equivalence of (∞,1)-categories]] identifying the [[domain]] of $R$ with the [[(∞,1)-category of algebras over an (∞,1)-monad]] over $T$ and $R$ itself as the canonical [[forgetful functor]].

This appears as ([[Higher Algebra|Higher Algebra, theorem 6.2.0.6, theorem 6.2.2.5]], [Riehl-Verity 13, section 7](#RiehlVerity13))
