## Idea

A _simplicial model category_ is a model or presentation for an [[(∞,1)-category]] that is half way in between a bare [[model category]] and a [[Kan complex]]-[[enriched category]].

Specifically, a simplicial model category is an [[SSet]]-[[enriched category]] $C$ together with the structure of a [[model category]] on its underlying [[category]] $C_0$ such that both structures are compatible in a reasonable way.

One important use of simplicial model categories comes from the fact that the full [[SSet]]-subcategory $C^\circ \hookrightarrow C$ on the fibrant-cofibrant objects -- which is not just [[SSet]]-enriched but actually [[Kan complex]]-enriched -- is the [[(∞,1)-category]]-enhancement of the [[homotopy category]] of the [[model category]] $C_0$.

For generalizations of this construction with [[SSet]] replaced by another [[monoidal model category]] see [[enriched homotopical category]].



## Definition

A **simplicial model category** is an [[enriched model category]] which is enriched over $sSet_{Quillen}$: the category [[sSet]] equipped with its standard [[model structure on simplicial sets]].


This means that a simplicial model category is

* an [[sSet]]-[[enriched category]]

  * which is [[power]]ed and [[copower]]ed over [[SSet]]

* with the structure of a [[model category]] on the underlying category $C_0$

* such that for every cofibration $i : A \to B$ and every fibration $p : X \to Y$ in $C_0$ the morphism of [[simplicial set]]s $C(B,X) \stackrel{i^* \times p_*}{\to} C(A,X) \times_{C(A,Y)} C(B,Y)$ is a fibration;

* and such that this fibration is an acyclic fibration whenever either $i$ or $p$ are acyclic.



## Examples

The category $sSet_{Quillen}$ is a [[monoidal model category]] and is hence naturally enriched, as a model category, over itself. This is the archetypical simplicial model category.

For $C$ any small [[sSet]]-[[enriched category]] and $A$ [[simplicial combinatorial model category]], the [[global model structure on functors]] $[C^{op}, A]_{proj}$ and $[C^{op},A]_{inj}$ are themselved simplicial combinatorial model categories.

The [[Bousfield localization of model categories|left Bousfield localization]] of these at any set of morphisms is again a combinatorial simplicial model category. Large clases of examples arise this way. In particular for $A = sSet_{Quillen}$ itself this yields the [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]].

## Simplicial Quillen equivalent models {#SimpEquivMods}

While some model categories do not admit an $sSet_{Quillen}$-enrichment, for large classes of model categories one can find an [[Quillen equivalence]] to a model cateory that does have an $sSet_{Quillen}$-enrichment.

###### Theorem

Every left proper combinatorial model category is Quillen equivalent to a simplicial model category.

More precisely: let $A$ be a 

* [[proper model category|left proper]];

* [[combinatorial model category|combinatorial]] or [[cellular model category|cellular]]

model category. Then the category $sA := [\Delta^{op}, A]$ of [[simplicial object]]s in $A$ carries the structure of a simplicial model category with respect to its canonical $sSet$-enrichment, such that the functor $ev_0 : sA \to A$ that sends a simplicial object to its degree 0 piece exhibits a [[Quillen equivalence]]

$$
  c_* : A \stackrel{\to}{\leftarrow} : ev_0
  \,.
$$

In $sA$ we have

* the weak equivalences are those morphisms that induce weak equivalences in $A$ under [[homotopy colimit]] over $\Delta$;

* the cofibrations are cofibrations in the [[Reedy model structure]] on $[\Delta^{op}, A]$.

* the fibrant objects are precisely the Reedy-fibrant objects all whose face and degenarcy maps are week equivalences in $A$.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

This is theorem 1.2 of

* [[Dan Dugger]], _Replacing model categories with simplicial ones_ Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. vol. 353 (2001), #12, 5003-5027. ([web](http://www.uoregon.edu/~ddugger/smod.html))

The simplicial enrichment is theorem 6.1

The charaxcterization of the fibrant objects is theorem 5.7.

###### Theorem


There is a similar model structure on $sA$ where instead the cofibrations are the cofibrations with respect to the  projective [[global model structure on functors]] on $[\Delta^{op}, A]$.

In this the fibrant objects are precisely the simplicial objects that are degreewise fibrant in $A$, and for which all face and degeneracy maps are weak equivalences in $A$. 

The identity functor established a [[Quillen equivalence]] between this model structure and the one discussed above

$$
  s A_{Reedy, loc} \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\to} sA_{proj, loc}
  \,.
$$

###### Theorem
**(uniqueness)**

Let $A$ be a [[model category]]. Then there is at most one model category 
structure on $s A = [\Delta^{op}, A]$ such that

* every morphism that is degreewise a weak equivalence in $A$ is a weak equivalence;

* the cofibrations are those of the [[Reedy model structure]];

* the fibrant objects are the Reedy-fibrant objects whose face and
  degeneracy maps are weak equivalences in $A$.
