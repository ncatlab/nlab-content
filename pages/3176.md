A **logical functor** is a [[functor]] between [[toposes]] which preserves all the topos structure, including in particular [[power objects]], but not any infinitary structure (even if the topos is a [[Grothendieck topos]]).  This should not be confused with a [[geometric morphism]], which is a different sort of morphism between toposes that treats them more "geometrically."

Since all the topos structure follows from having [[finite limits]] and [[power objects]], it suffices to define a logical functor to preserve these.  It then follows that it is also a [[locally cartesian closed functor]], a [[Heyting functor]], etc.

In particular, a logical functor preserves the truth of all sentences in the [[internal logic]].  If it is moreover [[conservative functor|conservative]], then it also *reflects* the truth of such sentences.  For example, the [[transfer principle]] of [[nonstandard analysis]] can be stated as the fact that a certain functor is logical and conservative.

The difference between geometric and logical functors between toposes is, in a certain sense, a [[categorification]] of the difference between a homomorphism of [[frames]] and a homomorphism of [[Heyting algebras]].  When the latter are [[complete lattice|complete]], these are the same objects with the same [[isomorphisms]] but different morphisms.  However, while frame homomorphisms are a natural categorification of geometric functors, a more precise categorification of Heyting algebra homomorphisms would be [[Heyting functors]], which preserve the internal first-order logic, but not the higher-order logic as logical functors do.
