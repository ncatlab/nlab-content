A **logical functor** is a [[functor]] between [[toposes]] which preserves all the topos structure.  This should not be confused with a [[geometric morphism]], which is a different sort of morphism between toposes that treats them more "geometrically."

Since all the topos structure follows from having [[finite limits]] and [[power objects]], it suffices to define a logical functor to preserve these.  It then follows that it is also a [[locally cartesian closed functor]], a [[Heyting functor]], etc.

In particular, a logical functor preserves the truth of all sentences in the [[internal logic]].  If it is moreover [[conservative functor|conservative]], then it also *reflects* the truth of such sentences.  For example, the [[transfer principle]] of [[nonstandard analysis]] can be stated as the fact that a certain functor is logical and conservative.
