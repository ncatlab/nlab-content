Unsurprisingly, _higher category theory_ is the study of higher [[category|categories]], known as [[n-category|n-categories]] or, when $n\to \infty$, as  [[infinity-category|infinity-categories]] or [[omega-category|omega-categories]].

#Development of higher category theory#

Higher category theory is still very much in the making. After a long time in which effort was concentrated on finding and comparing definitions of higher categories (see the literature below) more recently a school has established which proposes and uses [[quasi-category|quasicategories]] as the starting point for higher category theory.

#Patterns in higher categories#

Higher categories with special properties reproduce a multitude of concepts. One finds a [[periodic table]] of higher categories which lists these special cases.

# 1-Categorical aspects of higher category theory #

There are two major _1-categorical_ tools for _implicitly_ handling higher categories: 

* [[homotopy theory]] using [[model category|model catgeories]] and similar structures;

* [[enriched category theory]] for the case that the category enriched over is itself a model for higher structures, such as [[Top|topological spaces]] or [[simplicial set|simplicial sets]].

The consistent combination of these two is 

* [[homotopy coherent category theory]] or [[enriched homotopy theory]].


#Literature#

For a very gentle introduction to higher category theory, try [The Tale of <em>n</em>-Categories](http://mah.ucr.edu/home/baez/week73.html#tale), which begins in "week73" of This Week's Finds and goes on from there... keep clicking the links.

For a slightly more formal but still pathetically easy introduction, try:

* John Baez, [An Introduction to n-Categories](http://arxiv.org/abs/q-alg/9705009), in
<em>7th Conference on Category Theory and Computer Science</em>, eds.
E. Moggi and G. Rosolini, Springer Lecture Notes in
Computer Science vol. 1290, Springer, Berlin, 1997. 

For a free introductory text on $n$-categories that's <i>full of pictures</i>, try this:

* Eugenia Cheng and Aaron Lauda, [Higher-Dimensional Categories: An Illustrated Guidebook](http://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~elgc2/guidebook/).

Tom Leinster has written about "comparative $\infty$-categoriology" (to [borrow](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/01/comparative_smootheology.html) a term):

* Tom Leinster, _A Survey of Definitions of n-Category_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.CT/0107188))

* Tom Leinster, _Higher Operads, Higher Categories_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0305049))

The theory of [[quasi-category|quasi-categories]] as $(\infty, 1)$-[[(infinity,1)-category|categories]] has reached a point where it is well developed and being applied to a wealth of problems with

* Jacob Lurie, [[Higher Topos Theory]] ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.CT/0608040))

There's a lot more to add here, even if we restrict ourselves to very general texts.  (More specialized stuff should go under more specialized subcategories!)
