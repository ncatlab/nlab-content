The **empty theory** is the [[theory]] with no sorts (and therefore no functions or relations) and no axioms.  This can be formulated in any [[doctrine]]: there is an empty algebraic theory, an empty essentially algebraic theory, an empty first-order theory, and so on.

Each empty theory has a unique model in any category of the sort appropriate to the doctrine.  Its classifying category is the initial object of the category of such categories.  For instance, the [[classifying topos]] of the empty geometric theory is the terminal (since geometric morphisms of toposes are backwards from the "logical" direction) Grothendieck topos [[Set]].
