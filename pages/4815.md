## Definition

In an [[action functional]] on a space of [[pseudo-Riemannian manifolds]] -- such as the [[Einstein-Hilbert action]] functional for [[gravity]] -- a **cosmological constant** is a term proportional to the [[volume]]

$$
  S_{cos} :  (X,g) \mapsto \lambda \int_X dvol_g
  \,,
$$

where $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ is the _cosmological constant_ .

For instance pure Einstein-Hilbert gravity with cosmological constant (and not other fields) is given by the functional

$$
  S_{EH} + S_{cos} :  (X,g) \mapsto \int_X R dvol + \lambda \int_X d vol_g
  \,,
$$

Generically it happens that one considers action functionals where $\lambda$ is in fact not a constant, but a function of other fields $\phi$ on $X$. 

$$
  S : (X,g,\phi) \mapsto \int_X \lambda(\phi) dvol_g
  \,.
$$

In this context those solutions to the [[Euler-Lagrange equation]]s are of interest in which $\lambda(\phi)$ happens to be exactly or approximately constant. Many such models of not-really-constant-but-effectively-constant terms proportional to the volume are being proposed and considered in attempts to explain observed or speculated dynamics of the cosmos.

See in particular at [[FRW model]] for the role of the cosmological constant in homogeneous and isotropic models as in the [[standard model of cosmology]]. In that context the cosmological constant is also called the _dark energy_ (density), which makes up about 70% of the energy density of the [[observable universe]] (the rest being [[dark matter]]) and a comparatively little bit of [[baryon|baryonic]] [[matter]].
