# Principle of Unique Choice

## Idea

The __principle of unique choice__, also known as __function comprehension__, is the principle that every [[total relation|total]] [[functional relation|functional]] [[relation]] determines a function. This is true in [[classical logic]] and most forms of [[intuitionistic logic]] (for example the [[internal language]] of any [[topos]]), but fails in weaker systems such as the internal language of a [[quasitopos]] or [[tripos]].
