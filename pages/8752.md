## Idea

This is a notion of [[localization]] more suited  to [[model categories]]. To quote Hirschhorn:

'Localizing a model category with respect to a class of maps does not mean making the maps into isomorphisms; instead, it means making the images of those maps in the homotopy category into isomorphisms. Since the image of a map in the homotopy category is an isomorphism if and only if the map is a weak equivalence, localizing a model category with respect to a class of maps means making maps into weak equivalences.'

## Examples

* [[localization of a simplicial model category]]

* [[Bousfield localization of model categories]]
