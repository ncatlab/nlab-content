## Idea ##
The $DHR$ category is built from data used in [[DHR superselection theory]] and is used to provide a simplified proof of the [[Doplicher-Roberts reconstruction theorem]]. 


## Abstract ##
After the definition of objects and arrows we show several structures that the DHR category has.

## Definition ##

See [[DHR superselection theory]] and [[Haag-Kastler vacuum representation]] for the terminology used here.

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition
The transportable endomorphisms are the **objects** of the DHR category $\Delta$.
=--

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition
For two transportable endomorphisms the **set of intertwiners** are the **arrows**.
=--


## Properties ##

### DHR is a C-star-category with a direct product ###
It is straightforward to see that $\Delta$ is a category:

The identity arrow for each object in $\Delta$ is given by the identiy in $\mathcal{A}$. The composition of arrows is simply the composition of intertwiners:

From
$$
R \rho_1 = \rho_2 R
$$

$$
T \rho_2 = \rho_3 T
$$
follows
$$
T R \rho_1 = \rho_3 T R
$$

Several structural properties follow immediatly from the definition:

###### Lemma
$\Delta$ is a $\mathbb{C}-$[[algebroid]].

+-- {: .un_lemma }
###### Lemma
$\Delta$ is a [[dagger-category]] since, if $R$ is an intertwiner of the pair $(\rho_1, \rho_2)$, then $R^*$ is obviously an intertwiner of the pair $(\rho_2, \rho_1)$.
=--

Combining these two structures we get that $\Delta$ is a [[star-category]].

Since the arrows inherit a norm, we actually get

###### Lemma
$\Delta$ is a [[C-star-category]].
=--


+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition
It is possible to introduce a finite [[direct product]] in $\Delta$, if the net satisfies the [[Borchers property]].
=--

_Remark_: The [[Haag-Kastler vacuum representation]] that we talk about here satisfies the [[Borchers property]].

+-- {: .proof}
###### Sketch of the Proof
Let $\pi_1, \pi_2$ be admissible representations and $\rho_1, \rho_2$ be their transportable endomorphisms localized in $K_1, K_2$ respectively. Choose a double cone $K_0 \in \mathcal{J}_0$ that contains $K_1$ and $K_2$. Since the local von Neumann algebra $\mathcal{M}(K_0)$ is not trivial, it contains a nontrivial projection $E$, that is $0 \le E \le \mathbb{1}$.

Thanks to the Borchers property there is a double cone $K$ containing the closure of $K_0$, and partial isometries $W_1, W_2 \in \mathcal{M}(K)$ such that $W_1 W_1^* = E, W_2 W_2^* = \mathbb{1} - E$. 

Now we set
$$
\rho := W_1 \rho_1 W_1^* + W_2 \rho_2 W_2^*
$$
It is possible to show that $\pi_0 \rho$ is unitarily equivalent to $\pi_1 \oplus \pi_2$ and that $\rho$ is a transportable (and therefore in particular a localized) endomorphism. So we will call $\rho$ a **direct sum** of $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$.
=--

### DHR is a symmetric monoidal category ###
We first define the "tensor product":

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition
For endomorphisms we set $\rho_1 \otimes \rho_2 := \rho_1 \rho_2$.

For intertwiners $S \in Hom(\rho, \rho^{\prime})$ and $T \in Hom(\sigma, \sigma^{\prime})$ we define the tensor product via $S \otimes T := S \rho(T)$.
=--

_Remark_: In the [[AQFT]] literature the tensor product of arrows is sometimes called the _crossed product_ of intertwiners.

+-- {: .un_lemma }
###### Lemma
The tensor product as defined above turns $\Delta$ into a [[monoidal category]].
=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First: The tensor product of arrows is well defined, for any $A \in \mathcal{A}$ we have:

$$
S \otimes T (\rho_1 \otimes \rho_2) (A) 

= (S \rho(T)) \rho (\sigma(A)) 

= S \rho(T \sigma(A))

= \rho^{\prime} (T \sigma(A)) S

= \rho^{\prime} (\sigma^{\prime}(A) T) S

= \rho^{\prime} \sigma^{\prime}(A) \rho^{\prime}(T) S

= \rho^{\prime} \sigma^{\prime}(A) S \rho(T)

$$

which shows that the tensor product of intertwiners is an intertwiner for the tensor product of endomorphisms. The unit object is the identity endomorphism $\mathbb{1} \in \mathcal{A}$, left and right unitor and the associator are the identities, that is, $\Delta$ is **strict**.
