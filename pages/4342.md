## Idea ##

Given a [[quantum field theory]] presented by a [[local net of observables]] ([[AQFT]])

$$
  \mathcal{A} : Open(X) \to Algebras
$$

a _local endomorphism_ is a [[natural transformation|natural]] [[associative algebra|algebra]] [[homomorphism]] $\rho : \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{A}$ which is supported (nontrivial) on a [[compact space|compact]] region of [[spacetime]] $X$. 

These _local endomorphism_ are physically interpreted as local [[charges]]. By the locality of the local net, one finds that local endomorphisms natural form a [[braided monoidal category]]. This is called the _DHR category_.

The DHR category is thus built from data used in [[DHR superselection theory]] and is used to provide a simplified proof of the [[Doplicher-Roberts reconstruction theorem]]. 


## Abstract ##

After the definition of objects and arrows we show several structures that the DHR category has.

## Definition ##

See [[DHR superselection theory]] and [[Haag-Kastler vacuum representation]] for the terminology used here.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

The transportable endomorphisms are the **[[objects]]** of the DHR category $\Delta$.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For two transportable endomorphisms the **set of [[intertwiners]]** are the **[[morphisms]]**.

=--


## Properties ##

### DHR is a C-star-category with a direct product ###

It is straightforward to see that $\Delta$ is a [[category]]:

The [[identity]] morphism for each object in $\Delta$ is given by the identiy in $\mathcal{A}$. The [[composition]] of arrows is simply the composition of [[intertwiners]]:

From

$$
  R \rho_1 = \rho_2 R
$$

$$
  T \rho_2 = \rho_3 T
$$

follows

$$
  T R \rho_1 = \rho_3 T R
$$

Several structural properties follow immediatly from the definition:

+-- {: .num_lemma }
###### Lemma

$\Delta$ is a $\mathbb{C}-$[[algebroid]].

=--

+-- {: .un_lemma }
###### Lemma

$\Delta$ is a [[dagger-category]] since, if $R$ is an [[intertwiner]] of the pair $(\rho_1, \rho_2)$, then $R^*$ is obviously an [[intertwiner]] of the pair $(\rho_2, \rho_1)$.

=--

Combining these two structures we get that $\Delta$ is a [[star-category]].

Since the arrows inherit a norm, we actually get


+-- {: .num_lemma }
###### Lemma

 $\Delta$ is a [[C-star-category]].

=--


+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

It is possible to introduce a finite [[direct product]] in $\Delta$, if the net satisfies the [[Borchers property]].

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

The [[Haag-Kastler vacuum representation]] that we talk about here satisfies the [[Borchers property]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Sketch of the Proof

Let $\pi_1, \pi_2$ be admissible representations and $\rho_1, \rho_2$ be their transportable [[localized endomorphism|endomorphisms localized]] in $K_1, K_2$ respectively. Choose a double cone $K_0 \in \mathcal{J}_0$ that contains $K_1$ and $K_2$. Since the local von Neumann algebra $\mathcal{M}(K_0)$ is not trivial, it contains a nontrivial projection $E$, that is $0 \lt E \lt \mathbb{1}$.

Thanks to the Borchers property there is a double cone $K$ containing the closure of $K_0$, and partial isometries $W_1, W_2 \in \mathcal{M}(K)$ such that $W_1 W_1^* = E, W_2 W_2^* = \mathbb{1} - E$. 

Now we set
$$
\rho := W_1 \rho_1 W_1^* + W_2 \rho_2 W_2^*
$$
It is possible to show that $\pi_0 \rho$ is unitarily equivalent to $\pi_1 \oplus \pi_2$ and that $\rho$ is a transportable (and therefore in particular a localized) endomorphism. So we will call $\rho$ a **direct sum** of $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$.
=--

### DHR is a symmetric monoidal category ###

We first define the "[[tensor product]]":

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For endomorphisms we set $\rho_1 \otimes \rho_2 := \rho_1 \rho_2$.

For intertwiners $S \in Hom(\rho, \rho^{\prime})$ and $T \in Hom(\sigma, \sigma^{\prime})$ we define the tensor product via $S \otimes T := S \rho(T)$.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

In the [[AQFT]] literature the tensor product of arrows is sometimes called the _crossed product_ of intertwiners.

=--

+-- {: .num_lemma }
###### Lemma

The tensor product as defined above turns $\Delta$ into a [[monoidal category]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

First: The tensor product of arrows is well defined, for any $A \in \mathcal{A}$ we have:

$$
S \otimes T (\rho_1 \otimes \rho_2) (A) 

= (S \rho(T)) \rho (\sigma(A)) 

= S \rho(T \sigma(A))

= \rho^{\prime} (T \sigma(A)) S

= \rho^{\prime} (\sigma^{\prime}(A) T) S

= \rho^{\prime} \sigma^{\prime}(A) \rho^{\prime}(T) S

= \rho^{\prime} \sigma^{\prime}(A) S \rho(T)

$$

which shows that the tensor product of intertwiners is an intertwiner for the tensor product of endomorphisms. The unit object is the identity endomorphism $\mathbb{1} \in \mathcal{A}$, left and right unitor and the associator are the identities, that is, $\Delta$ is **strict**.

=--

Now to the braiding. The braiding is [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]] in $d \ge 3$ dimensions only, this has a topological reason: The causal complement of a double cone is pathwise connected in $d \ge 3$ dimensions only, but not in $d \le 2$ dimensions.

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

When we talk about $d = 1$ dimensions we mean one space dimension and zero time dimensions, so that a double cone in this context is simply an open interval, and spacelike separated double cones are simply disjoint open intervals.

To define the braiding we will need the following concepts:

=--

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For transportable endomorphisms $\rho, \sigma$ choose causally separated double cones $K_1 \perp K_2$ and $\rho_0 \in \hat \rho$ localized in $K_1$ and $\sigma_0 \in \hat \sigma$ localized in $K_2$. These endomorphisms $\rho_0, \sigma_0$ are then called **spectator endomorphisms** of $\rho$ and $\sigma$.

=--

Note that it is a theorem that causally disjoint transportable endomorphisms commute, therefore spectator endomorphisms always commute.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For transportable endomorphisms $\rho, \sigma$ and spectator endomorphisms $\rho_0, \sigma_0$ choose unitary interwiners $U \in Hom(\rho, \rho_0)$ and $V \in \Hom(\sigma, \sigma_0)$. Such unitaries are called **transporters**.

=--

Obviously both spectator endomorphisms and transporters are not unique, in general.

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For transportable endomorphisms $\rho, \sigma$, spectator endomorphisms $\rho_0, \sigma_0$ and transporters U, V define the **permutator** or **permutation symmetry** via
$$
\epsilon(\rho, \sigma) := (V^* \otimes U^*) (U \otimes V)
$$

=--


+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

The permutators are well defined and independent of the choice of spectator endomorphisms and transporters.
