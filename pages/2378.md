## Idea

A natural [[topology]] on [[mapping space]]s of [[continuous function]]s.

## Definition

Let $X$ and $Y$ be [[topological spaces]]. The set $Map(X,Y)$ (often denoted also $C(X,Y)$) of [[continuous maps]] from $X$ to $Y$ has a natural topology called the __compact-open topology__: a [[topological base|subbase]] of that topology consists of sets of the form $U_{K,V}$, where $K\subset X$ is [[compact space|compact]] and $V\subset Y$ is [[open subspace|open]], which consists of all continuous maps $f:X\to Y$ such that $f(K)\subset V$. 

If $Y$ is a [[metric space]] then the compact-open topology is the _topology of uniform convergence on compact subsets_ in the sense that $f_n \to f$ in $Map(X,Y)$ with the compact-open topology iff for every compact subset $K\subset X$, $f_n \to f$ uniformly on $K$. If (in addition) the domain $X$ is compact then this is the _topology of uniform convergence_.

## Properties

The compact-open topology is most sensible when the topology of $X$ is [[locally compact space|locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]], for in this case $Map(X,Y)$ with the compact-open topology is an [[exponential object]] $Y^X$ in the category [[Top]] of all [[topological space]]s.  This implies the [[exponential law for spaces]] , i.e. the adjunction map is a bijection $Top(X,Map(Y,Z))\cong Top(X\times Y,Z)$ whenever $Y$ is locally compact Hausdorff; and it becomes a homeomorphism $Map(X,Map(Y,Z))\cong Map(X\times Y,Z)$ if in addition $X$ is also Hausdorff. See also [[convenient category of topological spaces]].
