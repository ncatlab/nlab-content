## Definition 

For any [[prime number]] $p$, the [[ring]] of $p$-**adic integers** $\mathbb{Z}_p$ (which, to avoid possible confusion with the ring $\mathbb{Z}/(p)$ used in [[modular arithmetic]], is also written as $\widehat{\mathbb{Z}}_p$) may be described in one of several ways: 

1. To the person on the street, it may be described as (the ring of) numbers written in base $p$, but allowing infinite expansions to the left. Thus, numbers of the form 
$$\sum_{n \geq 0} a_n p^n$$ 
where $0 \leq a_n \lt p$, added and multiplied with the usual method of carrying familiar from adding and multiplying ordinary integers. 

2. More abstractly, it is the [[limit]] $\underset{\leftarrow}{\lim} \mathbb{Z}/(p^n)$, in the [[category]] of (unital) [[ring|rings]], of the [[diagram]] 
$$ \ldots \to \mathbb{Z}/(p^{n+1}) \to \mathbb{Z}/(p^n) \to \ldots \to \mathbb{Z}/(p) .$$ 
This is also a limit in the category of [[topological rings]], taking the rings in the diagram to have [[discrete topologies]].

3. Alternatively, it is the [[metric completion]] of the ring of [[integers]] $\mathbb{Z}$ with respect to the $p$-adic [[absolute value]]. Since addition and multiplication of integers are [[uniform space|uniformly continuous]] with respect to the $p$-adic [[absolute value]], they extend uniquely to a uniformly continuous addition and multiplication on $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Thus $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is a [[topological ring]]. 

4. Also $\mathbb{Z}[ [ x ] ]/(x-q)\mathbb{Z}[ [ x ] ]$, see at _[[analytic completion]]_. 

Hence one also speaks of the _$p$-adic completion_ of the integers.  See [[completion of a ring]] (which generalizes 2&3).


## Properties

### Topology

The ring of $p$-adic integers has the following properties: 

* As a [[topological space]], it is [[compact space|compact]], [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]], and [[totally disconnected space|totally disconnected]] (i.e., is a [[Stone space]]). Moreover, every point is an [[accumulation point]], and there is a countable basis of [[clopen set|clopen sets]] -- a Stone space with these properties must be [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to [[Cantor space]]. 

* As a [[topological group]] under addition, it is therefore an [[almost connected group]]. As an [[abelian group|abelian]]  [[compact group]], it is [[Pontryagin duality|Pontryagin dual]] to the [[Prüfer group|Prüfer]] $p$-group as [[discrete group]]. 

### Relation to profinite completion of the integers

+-- {: .num_example #ProfCompletionOfIntegers}
###### Example

The [[profinite completion of a group|profinite completion]] of the [[integers]] is

$$
  \widehat {\mathbb{Z}} 
    \coloneqq 
  \underset{\leftarrow}{\lim}_{n \in \mathbb{N}} (\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})
  \,.
$$

This is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[product]] of the $p$-adic integers for all $p$

$$
  \widehat{\mathbb{Z}} \simeq \underset{p\; prime}{\prod} \mathbb{Z}_p
  \,.
$$

###### Definition

The ring of integral [[adeles]] $\mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{Z}}$ is the [[product]]
of the profinite completion $\widehat{\mathbb{Z}}$ of the integers,
example \ref{ProfCompletionOfIntegers},
with the [[real numbers]]

$$
  \mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{Z}}
  \coloneqq
  \mathbb{R} \times \widehat{\mathbb{Z}}
  \,.
$$

The [[group of units]] of the ring of adeles is called the group of [[ideles]].

### As the formal neighbourhood of a prime
 {#AsFormalNeighbourhoodOfPrime}

The [[formal spectrum]] $Spf(\mathbb{Z}_p)$ of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ may be understood as the [[formal neighbourhood]] of the point corresponding to the [[prime]] $p$ in the [[prime spectrum]] $Spec(\mathbb{Z})$ of the [[integers]]. The inclusion

$$
  \{p\}
  \hookrightarrow
  Spf(\mathbb{Z}_p)
  \hookrightarrow
  Spec(\mathbb{Z})
$$

is the [[Isbell duality|formal dual]] of the canonical [[projection]] maps $\mathbb{Z}\to \mathbb{Z}_p\to \mathbb{Z}/(p)$.
