## Idea

The _Hitchin connection_ is a [[projectively flat connection]] over the [[moduli space of Riemann surfaces]] whose [[fiber]] of a [[conformal structure]] $\Sigma$ is the [[space of quantum states]] with [[geometric quantization]] assigns to the induced [[Kähler polarization]] on the [[moduli space of flat connection]] on $\Sigma$.

Hence this is a flat connection that exhibits the relative independence of the [[geometric quantization]] of [[Chern-Simons theory]] from the choice of [[polarization]]. It is akin to the _[[Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov connection]]_, which serves the same purpose.

A review is in ([Lauridsen 10, section 2](#Lauridsen10)).

(What is now called the Hitchin connection appears in theorem 3.6 there, its expression in local coordinates is around (3.15). That for abelian gauge group $U(1)$ the classical [[Riemann theta functions]] constitute the covariantly constant sections of the Hitchin connection in these coordinates is remark 4.12.)
