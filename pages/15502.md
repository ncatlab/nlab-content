a sextet for two each of violins,) As associate artistic director of the Savannah Music Festival,C. about a decade ago from New York and obviously New York is widely seen as the center of jazz international jazz Why did you leave Why did you decide to settle in Durham MARSALIS: The scene had changed a lot There weren't a lot of musicians that I actually wanted to hear because there wasn't anything I could actually learn in those situations And it didn't make any sense for me to spend the amount of money that you have to spend to live in a city like New York when I could spend considerably less somewhere else and get a house with a backyard It just made a lot of sense and Durham is a very vibrant cultural little town For instance the big town in North Carolina is Charlotte and I guarantee you more people read the New York Times in the Durham/Chapel Hill area than they do in Charlotte even though they have the football team and the basketball team The Research Triangle is a very cosmopolitan area RAZ: Did you want to be back in the South I mean you grew up in New Orleans MARSALIS: I did I wanted to be back in the South I'd had enough of New York living ?? I had enough of 5-year-olds calling adults by their first name The conversations are just very very different When I would play golf in New York and I'd meet new people they would ask me if I was married and they would ask me if I had kids and then they asked me what I did for a living The small metaphoric difference is down here they'd say "Are you married" Then they'd ask "Well what's your wife's name" That's very different in a place like New York because it's the place to go for young people; it's for young ambitious people I became a man in New York New York made me the musician that I am and the person that I am so it's impossible for me to say I regret having lived there RAZ: Talk to me about what you're doing [as an artist-in-residence] at North Carolina Central You're working with kids with college students and helping develop the next generation of jazz musicians MARSALIS: Not really no I'm making them mad more so than mentoring them But North Carolina Central is a very different school Most of the kids who go to that school are from very small towns in North Carolina They're the best player in town and one thing that they all have in common is that by the time they get to school they've never heard a jazz record and never heard a classical record so they don't really have an understanding of how high the bar is until they show up So that first semester is just culture shock for them And it's fine because I think what I'm really more interested in is being like a football coach where a majority of the players on your team ?? regardless of the quality of the college football program ?? you are training them or using the skills that they have to process information that's going to help them later on in life in professions that are completely separate from football My goal is that 10 years from now some students come in and I'll say "Have you ever heard a jazz record" And they'll say "Yeah my teacher played one for me when I was in high school" and the teacher is one of our students I think we really have to find a way to gain advocacy for something other than marching band and popular music in high school programs I think one of the ways we can change it is by having teachers who are armed with information that fights back against the general lack of understanding about what music does for students RAZ: When you first encounter those kids what do you tell them they have to listen to MARSALIS: The first thing out of the gate is this Lester Young record called  because Lester Young was a marvelous musician who influenced Charlie Parker Dexter Gordon a whole lot of other musicians You can sing it and it's simple and it's not overly complicated They spend all their time learning solos from this or learning the John Coltrane solo Lester Young has some of the simplest solos in the world and these young guys and gals they can't play them not with authenticity They can play the notes but they can't make it sound like he made it sound So I start simple We wind up sitting on the same couple of songs for a whole semester RAZ: North Carolina Central is a historically black college and I want to ask you about the young people who go into the profession of jazz Increasingly fewer and fewer young African-Americans are the studio musicians the session musicians and I wonder what you make of that MARSALIS: The studio scene in New York was never heavily populated with African-Americans Black folks just weren't in there ?? you could count them There isn't really a studio scene anymore It's mostly just a keyboard player now if you listen to most of the commercials that are on; it's not live musicians anymore But in the '80s when we got to New York there were virtually no blacks in the studio and musician scene at all The biggest issue that we have is that because of budget cuts ?? the first place they cut in New York City for instance was in music The majority of the high schools and the public schools in NYC don't even have band programs Hip-hop in a lot of ways is an outgrowth of a lack of instruments and a desire to play music so we can't really fault the kids for that These are the times we live in But ultimately I don't really care what color you are or where you come from I just want you to play jazz and sound like a jazz musician The only requirement for when she sang opera was that it had to sound like opera She didn't come in there singing opera like or ; she had to sound like a classical singer And whoever's playing with me they have to sound like a jazz musician The music is what it is and the cultural imprint of the music exists You have a lot of people who want to play jazz but want to ignore the cultural imprint of the music MARSALIS: The kids that you work with at NC Central a lot of them probably coming to school having grown up listening to hip-hop music How does it influence the kind of music they make or will make MARSALIS: It just depends I would much rather have kids who spent their younger years playing pop music than going to jazz camp because ultimately you're trying to play music in a fashion like I said earlier where you attract people who are casual listeners So the music has to have a pulse A lot of modern jazz does not have ?? it has no pulse to it which is why when people listen to it it just sounds like flat-line music You have to really understand the technical context of it to even get what makes it good When I talked to a lot of older people ?? when I was playing with Blakey I would always just talk because my father said you need to talk to people and find out what they're thinking ?? their appreciation of jazz was very general They didn't have any specific ideas When they talked about Coltrane or they talked about  they talked about how the music made them feel They never once talked about a specific chord structure that they thought was great You can listen to live records and hear people talking and in the middle of talking they suddenly react to a sound that one of the musicians made "Ya Play that" So my ideas about the music were less about all of the specific things than the general things I think one of Justin's great advantages was he clearly played R&B music growing up and he played in the church and that's a big deal I like musicians who have done stuff like that because they understand how to communicate with laypeople RAZ: When people put this Four MFs Playin' Tunes on what do you hope they will hear MARSALIS: When my kids were younger one of the mothers of one of the kids in the school came up and said "I heard that you only play jazz and classical music for [your] daughters" And it was clear that she only played pop music for her kids And I said "Well yeah" And she said "Why" I said "When you listen to a song like a song ?? a song about alligators or kangaroos or whatever it is ?? it's about that it's about kangaroos But if you play for your kid the music is whatever your kid wants it to be about It's instrumental music The kids' imaginations can run wild" I used to watch my kids hear this music and say "This music reminds me of ." and they would basically tell stories So the stories that the music tells are actually personal to the listener I don't want the listener to come up with the same conclusions that I have come up with because they're not me they haven't lived my life They don't know nearly as much music as I do RAZ: Do you listen to your own music MARSALIS: No it's counterproductive I'm trying to get better I'm not trying to stand still I just picked up a cool version of Handel's opera Julius Caesar and I'm trying to ingest that RAZ: Do you ever get feedback from your dad or your brothers MARSALIS: Not really With my brothers if they don't like it that's when I hear from them But usually they don't call to say "Man that's amazing That's killing" Cause we don't really talk about music when we talk When I talk to my mom she says "How's the family How are you feeling How are you doing Take care of yourself Eat more matzo ball soup" That's where we are And my father's just like "Yeah what's happening out there" Not as much as when I was in New York He was always excited when I was in New York because he always wanted to move out there and didn't So whenever I would meet somebody I would always ?? especially with digital technology when we got older ?? we did a gig once with  and I called and he talked to Oscar for 15 minutes and that made him very excited He was just over the moon with that one But other than that when we do talk we don't really talk about music that much RAZ: Do you think that you guys would make a record with all five of you on it again MARSALIS: I doubt it We all have very different sounds and directions that we're going in the music When you start getting all of these guys together then at some point you have to kind of push aside your direction because you can't have five people going in different directions at the same time Everybody has to be on the same page so what we wind up doing is deferring to my dad's sound and my dad's style and we'll do that for a little while So it could happen but it's unlikely right now RAZ: You have two kids ?? do you like any of the pop music that they listen to MARSALIS: No not really But it's for them it's not for me I'm always leery of people my age singing along with 11-year-old girls' pop songs I listened to a lot more popular music clearly when I was younger But I don't really use music as a template for my life ?? I don't use it to reminisce Songs aren't really a soundtrack to my life ?? songs have more value to me than that It's not to diminish the value to other people but when I hear songs from the '70s there's songs that I like and then there's songs that I don't like I went to a Jonas Brothers concert and I was amazed; I loved it The piano player Nick Jonas he's really really good There's not a lot of it I like My kids listen to it and I tend to go in the other room when it's on but I am 51 years old I don't think that when they were crafting these songs they had my old behind in mind so it's OK with me We need a title now. and did a walk-on.
