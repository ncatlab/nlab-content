I am a mathematician at the [Harish-Chandra Research Institute](http://www.hri.res.in/) in Allahabad, India.  My primary interest in mathematics has been algebraic geometry, more specifically the theory of moduli spaces of vector bundles and quiver representations, and the theory of connections on holomorphic vector bundles.  I am also interested in the univalent foundations of mathematics, especially with reference to the formalisation of mathematics, and am trying to follow the work of the [UniMath](https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath) project.
