## Idea

In [[logic]], a __judgment__ or __judgement__ is a "meta-[[proposition]]"; that is, a proposition belonging to the [[meta-language]] rather than to the [[object language]].


## In first-order logic

In [[first-order logic]], a paradigmatic example of a judgement is the judgement that a certain string of symbols is a well-formed [[proposition]].  Another example of a judgement is the judgement that these symbols form a proposition [[proof|proved]] to be [[true]].  Neither of these judgements is the same thing as the proposition itself.  In particular, the proposition is a statement *in* the logic, while the judgement that the proposition is a proposition or is provably true is a statement *about* the logic.


## In type theory

The distinction between judgements and [[propositions]] is particularly important in [[intensional type theory]].

The paradigmatic example of a judgment in [[type theory]] is a *typing judgment*.  The assertion that a [[term]] $t$ has [[type]] $A$ (written "$t:A$") is not a statement *in* the type theory (that is, not something which one could apply logical operators to in the type-theoretic system) but a statement *about* the type theory.

Often, type theories include only a particular small set of judgments, such as:

* typing judgments
* judgments of typehood (usually written $A \;type$)
* judgments of [[equality]] between typed terms, written say $(t=t'):A$

These limited sets of judgments are often defined [[inductive definition|inductively]] by giving "introduction rules" that specify under what hypotheses one is allowed to conclude the given judgment.  These inductive definitions can be formalized by choosing a particular [[type theory]] to be the meta-language; usually a very simple type theory suffices (such as a [[dependent type theory]] with only [[dependent product types]]).  Such a meta-type-theory is often called a [[logical framework]].
