## Idea

In [[perturbative quantum field theory]] a _Ward identity_ expresses the invariance or equivariance of [[correlation functions]] under some given [[symmetry]].

For a [[Lagrangian field theory]], the _classical Ward identity_ is an [[on-shell]] [[equation]] satisfied by classical [[observables]] due to [[symmetries]] of the [[action functional]]. For quantum observables it is not automatic, but one may consider imposing it as a constraint on the choice of [[renormalization]]. As such it is called the _quantum Ward identity_ (really a condition). It is closely related to the [[Schwinger-Dyson equation]].


## Examples
