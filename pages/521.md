## Definition

Given a [[category]] $C$ and an [[object]] $c \in C$, the __under category__ (also called __coslice category__) $c \downarrow C$ (also written $c/C$ and sometimes, confusingly, $c\backslash C$) is the category whose

* objects are morphisms in $C$ starting at $c$; $c \to d$

* morphisms are commuting triangles 
$
 \array{
    && c
    \\
    & \swarrow && \searrow
    \\
    d_1 &&\to && d_2
  }
  \,.
$

The under category $c\downarrow C$ is a kind of [[comma category]]; it is the strict pullback 

$$
 \array{
  c \big\downarrow C
  &\to&
  pt
  \\
  \big\downarrow
  &&
  \big\downarrow^{\mathrlap{pt \mapsto c}}
  \\
  [I,C]
  &\stackrel{d_0}{\to}&
  C
 } 
$$
in [[Cat]], where

* $I$ is the [[interval category]] $\{0 \to 1\}$;

* $[I,C]$ is the [[closed monoidal category|internal hom]] in [[Cat]], which here is the [[arrow category]] $Arr(C)$;

* the functor $d_0$ is evaluation at the left end of the interval;

* $pt$, the point, is the terminal category, the 0th [[oriental]], the 0-globe;

* the right vertical morphism maps the single object of the point to the object $c$.

The left vertical morphism $c \downarrow C \to C$ is the forgetful morphism which forgets the tip of the triangles mentioned above.

The [[duality|dual]] notion is an [[over category]].


## Examples

* $Set_*$, the category of [[pointed set]]s, is the undercategory $pt\downarrow Set$, where $pt \simeq \{\bullet\}$ is [[generalized the|the]] singleton set.

* If $0$ is an [[initial object]] in $\mathbf{C}$, then $0\downarrow\mathbf{C}$ is isomorphic to $\mathbf{C}$.

* The category of commutative algebras over a field $F$ is the category $F \downarrow$[[CRing]] of commutative rings under $F$.

### Limits and colimits

###### Proposition

A  [[limit]] in an [[under category]] is computed as a limit in the underlying category.

Precisely: let $C$ be a [[category]], $t \in C$ an [[object]], and $t/C$ the corresponding [[under category]], and $p colon t/C \to C$ the obvious projection.

Let $F : D \to t/C$ be any [[functor]]. Then, if it exists, the [[limit]] over $p \circ F$ in $C$ is the image under $p$ of the limit over $F$:

$$
  p(\lim F)  \simeq \lim (p F)
$$

and $\lim F$ is uniquely characterized by $\lim (p F)$.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Over a morphism $\gamma : d \to d'$ in $D$ the limiting cone over $p F$  (which exists by assumption) looks like

$$
  \array{
    && \lim p F
    \\
    & \swarrow && \searrow
    \\
    p F(d) &&\stackrel{p F(\gamma)}{\to}&& p F(d') 
  }
$$


By the universal property of the limit this has a unique
lift to a cone in the [[under category]] $t/C$ over $F$:

$$
  \array{
    && t 
    \\
    & \swarrow &\downarrow & \searrow
    \\
    && \lim p F
    \\
    \downarrow & \swarrow && \searrow & \downarrow
    \\
    p F(d) &&\stackrel{p F(\gamma)}{\to}&& p F(d') 
  }
$$


It therefore remains to show that this is indeed a limiting cone over $F$. Again, this is immediate from the universal property of the limit in $C$. For let $t \to Q$ be another cone over $F$ in $t/C$, then $Q$ is another cone over $p F$ in $C$ and we get in $C$ a universal morphism $Q \to \lim p F$

$$
  \array{
    && t
    \\
    & \swarrow & \downarrow & \searrow
    \\
    && Q
    \\
    \downarrow & \swarrow &\downarrow & \searrow & \downarrow
    \\
    && \lim p F
    \\
    \downarrow & \swarrow && \searrow & \downarrow
    \\
    p F(d) &&\stackrel{p F(\gamma)}{\to}&& p F(d') 
  }
$$


A glance at the diagram above shows that
the composite $t \to Q \to \lim p F$ constitutes a morphism
of cones in $C$ into the limiting cone over $p F$. Hence it must equal our morphism $t \to \lim p F$, by the universal property of $\lim p F$, and hence the above diagram does commute as indicated.

This shows that the morphism $Q \to \lim p F$
which was the unique one giving a cone morphism on $C$ does lift to a
cone morphism in $t/C$, which is then necessarily unique, too.  This demonstrates the required universal property of $t \to \lim p F$ and 
thus identifies it with $\lim F$.

###### Remark

One often says "$p$ [[reflected limit|reflects limits]]" to express the conclusion of this proposition. A conceptual way to consider this result is by appeal to a more general one: if $U: A \to C$ is [[monadic functor|monadic]] (i.e., has a left adjoint $F$ such that the canonical comparison functor $A \to (U F)-Alg$ is an equivalence), then $U$ both reflects and preserves limits. In the present case, the projection $p: A = t/C \to C$ is monadic, is essentially the category of algebras for the monad $T(-) = t + (-)$, at least if $C$ admits binary coproducts. (Added later: the proof is even simpler: if $U: A \to C$ is the underlying functor for the category of algebras of an _endofunctor_ on $C$ (as opposed to algebras of a monad), then $U$ reflects and preserves limits; then apply this to the endofunctor $T$ above.)
