## Idea

The [[Ochanine elliptic genus]] $\Omega^{SO}_\bullet \to M_\bullet = \mathbb{Z}[\tfrac{1}{2}][\delta, \epsilon]$

lifts to a map of spectra 

$$
  M SO \longrightarrow Ell
$$

([Landweber-Ravenel-Stong 93](#LandweberRavenelStong93)). Here $Ell[\tfrac{1}{6}]$ is equivalently [[tmf0(2)]] ([Behrens 05](#Behrens05)) and as such this lift is analogous to the [[string orientation of tmf]].

## Properties

### Induced relation between cobordism and homology

The SO orientation of elliptic cohomology makes it expressible in terms of the [[cobordism cohomology theory]], see at _[[cobordism theory determining homology theory]]_ ([Landweber-Ravenel-Stong 93, theorem 1.2](#LandweberRavenelStong93)).
