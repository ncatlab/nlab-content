The __identity natural transformation__ on a [[functor]] $F: C \to D$ is the [[natural transformation]] $id_F: F \to F$ that maps each [[object]] $x$ of $C$ to the identity [[morphism]] $id_{F(x)}$ in $D$.  The identity natural transformations are the [[identity morphism|identities]] for [[vertical composition]] of natural transformations in the [[functor category]] $D^C$ and in the [[2-category]] [[Cat]].
