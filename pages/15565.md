## Idea

An analog of [[jet spaces]] in [[arithmetic geometry]].

## Definition
 {#Definition}

Notice that the [[p-adic integers]] $\mathbb{Z}_p$ are (by the discussion at [p-adic integer -- as formal power series](p-adic+integer#AsFormalNeighbourhoodOfPrime))  the analog in [[arithmetic geometry]] of a [[formal power series]] ring (around the point $p \in$ [[Spec(Z)]]), hence their [[formal spectrum]] $Spf(\mathbb{Z}_p)$ is an incarnation in [[arithmetic geometry]] of an abstract [[formal disk]]. 

Therefore in the sense of [[synthetic differential geometry]] the $p$-[[formal neighbourhood]] of any [[arithmetic scheme]] $X$ around a global point $x \colon Spec(\mathbb{Z}) \to X$ is the space of lifts

$$
  \array{
    Spf(\mathbb{Z}_p)  && \stackrel{\hat x}{\longrightarrow}&& X
    \\
    & \searrow &&  \swarrow
    \\
    && Spec(\mathbb{Z})
  }
  \,.
$$

Moreover the map that sends an commutative ring, hence an [[arithmetic variety]], to its $p$-formal power series in this sense is the construction of the [[ring of Witt vectors]] ($p$-typical Witt vectors if one fixes one prime, and "big Witt vectors" if one considers all at once) - see e.g. [Hartl 06, section 1.1](#Hartl06).

The following definition says essentially this, but further sends the resulting space to [[F1]]-geometry in the sense of [[Borger's absolute geometry]]:
 
For $X= Spec(R)$ an [[affine scheme]] over [[Spec(Z)]] (hence the formal dual of a [[ring]]), then the _arithmetic jet space_ of $X$ at [[prime]] $p$ is $(W_n)_\ast$ applied to the $p$-adic completion of $X$, where $(W_n)_\ast$ is the [[ring of Witt vectors]]-construction, the [[direct image]] of [[Borger's absolute geometry]] $Et(Spec(\mathbb{Z})) \to Et(Spec(\mathbb{F}_1))$.

The definition is originally due to ([Buium 96, section 2](#Buium96), [Buium 05, section 3.1](#Buium05)), reviewed in ([Buium 13, 1.2.3](#Buium13)). The above formulation is in ([Borger 10, (12.8.2)](#Borger10)).
