## Idea

The **compactness theorem** is a fundamental result of _[[model theory]]_ on the existence of [[models]] of [[first-order theories]].

Historically it goes back to work of [[Gödel]] and Mal'cev in the 1930s.

[[Lindström's theorem]] uses the compactness and the [[Löwenheim-Skolem theorem]] to characterize classical first-order logic. The validity or non-validity of the compactness theorem in logical systems other than first-order logic plays under the name of _compactness property_ an important role in [[abstract model theory]].

## Theorem

Briefly, the compactness theorem states that a set of first-order formulas $\Phi$ has a model precisely iff every finite subset of $\Phi$ has a model.

### Remark

There are different proofs for the compactness theorem e.g. an entirely 'semantic' one using [[ultraproduct|ultraproducts]]. A particularly transparent one relies on the completeness theorem for first-order logic and the essential finitude of the notion of formal proof[^end]: Suppose $\Phi$ has no model, due to completeness this implies that there is a contradiction $\varphi$ with $\Phi\vdash\varphi$ but such a deduction of $\varphi$ can involve only a finite subset $\Phi_0\subset \Phi$ hence $\Phi_0\vdash\varphi$ and $\Phi_0$ would have no model as well. 

Despite the intuitive appeal, this approach obliges one to establish the completeness theorem, which depends on fiddly details of formal proofs and deductive systems to make rigorous. 

### Compactness for propositional logic 

[^end]: In the German literature the compactness theorem is therefore also called 'Endlichkeitssatz'.

The motivation for the terminology stems from the observation that the compactness theorem literally expresses the compactness of a suitable topology on first-order structures.
