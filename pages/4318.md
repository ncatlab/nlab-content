## Idea

Dolbeault cohomology of a [[complex manifold]] $X$ is the [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] $H^q(X;\Omega_X^p)$, of the [[abelian sheaf]] $\Omega_X^p$ is [[Dolbeault complex]] of holomorphic $p$-forms.

## Properties

Given any [[holomorphic vector bundle]] $E$, one can form the Dolbeault resolution $E \otimes \Omega^{0,q}$, where $\Omega^{0,q}$ is the sheaf of $C^\infty$ $(0,q)$-forms. This is an acyclic resolution of $E$ and hence computes its [[sheaf cohomology]].
