## Idea

A **bounded set** in functional analysis is one that is eventually absorbed by every open neighbourhood of $0$.

###### Definition
Let $E$ be a [[LCTVS]].  A subset $B \subseteq E$ is **bounded** if whenever $U \subseteq E$ is a neighbourhood of $0$ then there is some $r \gt 0$ such that $B \subseteq r U$.
=--

The family of all bounded sets of a LCTVS defines a [[bornology]] on that space.
