## Definition

The **inverse function theorem** says that given any [[sequentially Cauchy complete]] [[Archimedean field]] $\mathbb{R}$ and a [[continuously differentiable function]] $f:I \to \mathbb{R}$ from an [[open interval]] $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ such that for all points $a \in I$,
$$\left| \frac{d f}{d x}(a) \right| \gt 0$$
the [[inverse function]] $f^{-1}:\mathrm{im}(f) \to \mathbb{R}$ exists and is unique and is defined by the first-order nonlinear [[ordinary differential equation]]

$$\left(\frac{d f}{d x} \circ f^{-1}\right) \frac{d f^{-1}}{d x} = 1$$

with initial condition $f^{-1}(f(a)) = a$. Classically, $\mathbb{R}$ is essentially unique, but constructively, there are multiple inequivalent [[sequentially Cauchy complete]] [[Archimedean fields]]. 

## Proof 

\begin{lemma}
Let $(-r, r)$ denote an [[open interval]] in $\mathbb{R}$ with radius $r$ and centre $0$. If $g:(-r, r) \to \mathbb{R}$ is a map such that $g(0) = 0$ and there exists a rational constant $0 \lt c \lt 1$ such that $\vert g(y) - g(x) \vert = c \vert y - x \vert$ for all $x \in (-r, r)$ and $y \in (-r, r)$, then $f = \mathrm{id}_\mathbb{R} + g$ is injective on $(-r, r)$ and 
$$(-(1 - c)r, -(1 - c)r) \subset (-f(r), f(r)) \subset (-(1 + c)r, -(1 + c)r)$$
where $\mathrm{id}_\mathbb{R}$ is the identity map on the real numbers, restricted in the domain to $(-r, r)$. 
\end{lemma}
