The elements in the [[Lorentz group]] $O(d-1,1)$ in the image of the [[special orthogonal group]] $SO(d-1) \hookrightarrow O(d-1,1)$ are _[[rotations]]_ in space. The further elements in the special Lorentz group $SO(d-1,1)$, which mathematically are "hyperbolic rotations" in a space-time plane, are called _boosts_ in [[physics]].
