## Idea

An _analytic function_ is a [[function]] that is locally given by a converging [[power series]].


## Definitions

Let $V$ and $W$ be [[complete space|complete Hausdorff]] [[topological vector spaces]], let $W$ be [[locally convex space|locally convex]], let $c$ be an [[element]] of $V$, and let $(a_0,a_1,a_2,\ldots)$ be an [[infinite sequence]] of [[homogeneous operator]]s from $V$ to $W$ with each $a_k$ of degree $k$.

Given an element $c$ of $V$, consider the [[infinite series]]

$$ 
  \sum_k a_k(x - c)^k
$$

(a [[power series]]).  Let $U$ be the [[interior]] of the set of $x$ such that this series converges in $W$; we call $U$ the __domain of convergence__ of the power series.  This series defines a [[function]] from $U$ to $W$; we are really interested in the case where $U$ is [[inhabited set|inhabited]], in which case it is a [[balanced neighbourhood]] of $c$ in $V$ (which is Proposition 5.3 of [Bochnak--Siciak](#BS)).

Let $D$ be any [[subset]] of $V$ and $f$ any [[continuous function]] from $D$ to $W$.  This function $f$ is __analytic__ if, for every $c \in D$, there is a power series as above with inhabited domain of convergence $U$ such that
$$ f(x) = \sum_k a_k(x - c)^k $$
for every $x$ in both $D$ and $U$.  (That $f$ is continuous follows automatically in many cases, including of course the finite-dimensional case.)


## Generalisation

The vector spaces $V$ and $W$ may be generalised to [[analytic manifold]]s and (more generally) [[analytic space]]s.  However, these are [[manifolds]] and [[varieties]] modelled on vector spaces using analytic [[transition functions]], so the notion of analytic function between vector spaces is most fundamental.


## Complex-analytic functions of one variable

If $W$ is a vector space over the [[complex numbers]], then we have this very nice theorem, due essentially to [[Édouard Goursat]]:

###### Theorem
A function from $D \subseteq \mathbb{C}$ to $W$ is [[differentiable function|differentiable]] if and only if it is analytic.

(Differentiability here is in the usual sense, that the difference quotient converges in $W$.)  See [[holomorphic function]] and [[Goursat theorem]].
