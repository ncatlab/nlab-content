## Idea
 {#Idea}

In [[functional analysis]], the concept of _distributional density_, usually just called _distribution_ for short, is a generalization of the concept of [[density]], hence of something that may be [[integration|integrated]] against a [[bump function]] to produce a [[number]]. If a non-degenerate background [[density]]/[[volume form]] $dvol$ is fixed, then each other density is a [[function]] relative to $dvol$, and hence with such an identification understood distributional densities are _generalized functions_, namely objects that may arise as potentially singular [[limit of a sequence|limits]] of [[sequences]] of [[smooth functions]].  Famous examples of such are the [[delta distributions]] and the [[Heaviside distribution]] which behave like constant functions with an infinitely sharp spike or kink, respectively.

Distributional densities appear notably as [[fundamental solutions]] to linear [[partial differential equations]] (such as for the [[wave equation]]/[[Klein-Gordon equation]], whose fundamental solutions are the [[propagators]] of [[free fields|free quantum fields]]), which is the context in which the concept was originally introduced. The study of their singularity structure (encoded by their [[singular support]] and their [[wave front set]]) is a fundamental tool in [[PDE theory]] (for instance in the [[propagation of singularities theorem]]), known as _[[microlocal analysis]]_. Distributions are also fundamental in the rigorous construction of [[perturbative quantum field theory]], where they appear in the variant as [[operator-valued distributions]].


Often distributions are considered by default just on [[open subsets]] of [[Euclidean space]] with its canonical [[volume form]] tacitly understood. But the concept of distributions makes sense more generally on general [[smooth manifolds]] (at least). If these are equipped with the structure of a ([[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo-]]) [[Riemannian manifold]] then the induced [[volume form]] again identifies distributions with generalized functions. 

More in detail, given an actual [[density]]/[[volume form]] $dvol$ on some [[smooth manifold]] $X$, then the operation of [[integration]] of [[bump functions]] (elements in the [[topological vector space]] $C^\infty_c(X)$) against $dvol$ yields the [[continuous linear functional]]

$$
  \array{
    C^\infty_c(X)
      &\longrightarrow&
    \mathbb{R}
    \\
    b &\mapsto& \int_{x \in X} b(x) dvol(x)
  }
  \,.
$$

However, not every [[continuous linear functional]] on $C^\infty_c(X)$ arises this way. For example for $x_0 \in X$ any point, the simple [[evaluation]] map

$$
  \delta_{x_0}
  \;\colon\;
  b
  \mapsto
  b(x_0)
$$

is also a continuous linear functional on $C^\infty_c(X)$ (the "[[delta distribution]]"). While this is not the integral against any [[bump function]] times a fixed density, it is the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] of integrations against any [[sequence]] of bump functions (times the fixed density) whose [[support]] narrows in on $x_0$. Therefore one defines a distributional density simply to be _any_ [[continuous linear functional]] on $C^\infty_c(X)$. 

Various immediate variants of this definition may be considered. For instance if the space of "test functions" $C^\infty_c(X)$ is generalized to that of all [[smooth functions]], then one speaks of _[[compactly supported distributions]]_, or if it is enlarged just to the [[Schwartz space]] of functions with all [[derivatives]] rapidly decreasing, then one speaks of [[tempered distributions]]. These are important as on them there is a a good concept of [[Fourier transform of distributions]]. 

Most of the usual constructions of [[differential calculus]] generalize from [[smooth functions]] to distributions, notably there is a concept of [[derivative of distributions]] (defined by generalizing the formula for [[integration by parts]]). A key subtlety is that, however, some standard operations on functions become only [[partial function|partially defined]] on distributions, namely only when their singularity structure is compatible. In particular there is a concept of [[pullback of distributions]] and the [[product of distributions]] compatible with that of smooth functions, but defined only whenever the [[wave front sets]] of the distributions involved satisfy suitable compatibility conditions. Taking this subtlety into account for the [[operator-valued distributions]] appearing in [[perturbative quantum field theory]] is what leads to the concept of [[Wick algebras]] ("normal ordering"), see there for more.

Due to their potentially singular nature, there is more freedom in the [[extension of distributions]] than there is for smooth functions. Notably for extensions from the complement of a single point to that point the freedom is in choosing a [[point-supported distribution]], and these are precisely the [[derivative of a distribution|derivatives]] of [[delta-distributions]]. In the construction of [[time-ordered products]] of [[operator-valued distributions]] it is precisely this freedom in choosing point-[[extensions of distributions]] which in [[perturbative quantum field theory]] is known as "[[renormalization]]".

### As continuous linear functionals
 {#TraditionalDefinition}

Distributions come in various flavors, depending on what spaces of functions they act on. The functions they act on are called **test functions**; typically they are smooth functions on domains in Euclidean space satisfying some boundedness property. 

The widest (and generally the default) notion is as follows.

###### Definition
**(compactly supported test functions)**

For $X \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ a [[smooth manifold]] given as an [[open subset]] of a [[Euclidean space]], the [[topological vector space]] $C^\infty_c(X)$ of _compactly supported test functions_ is the following

1. the underlying set is the set of [[bump functions]], hence of [[smooth functions]] $X \to \mathbb{R}$ to the [[real numbers]] with [[compact support]];

1. equipped with evident [[real vector space]] structure given by pointwise addition and pointwise multipication of functions.

1. equipped with the [[topological space|topology]] which is the [[metric topology]] induced from the family of [[seminorms]]

   $$\rho_{K, \alpha}(f) = \sup_{x \in K} |\partial^{\alpha} f|$$ 

   where $K \subseteq U$ is [[compact topological space|compact]] and $\alpha = (\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n)$ is a multi-index and 

   $$\partial^{\alpha} = \frac{\partial^{\alpha_1}}{\partial x^{\alpha_1}} \ldots \frac{\partial^{\alpha_n}}{\partial x^{\alpha_n}}$$ 

   is the corresponding [[differential operator]].

###### Proposition

The [[topological vector space]] $C^\infty_c(X)$ of compactly supported test functions (def. \ref{CompactlySupportedTestFunctions}) is [[locally convex topological vector space|locally convex]] and [[complete space|complete]] with respect to its [[uniformity]]; it is in fact an LF-space: an [[inductive limit]] of [[Fréchet spaces]] $C_c^{\infty}(K)$ (each of which has [[empty set|empty]] [[interior]] as a [[subspace]] of $C_c^{\infty}(U)$, so by the [[Baire category theorem]], $C_c^{\infty}(U)$ is not itself a [[Fréchet space]]).

###### Definition
**(distribution on Euclidean space)**

Let $X \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be a [[smooth manifold]] given as an [[open subset]] of [[Euclidean space]].

A **distribution on** $X$ is a [[continuous linear functional]] of the form

$$C^\infty_c(X) \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$$ 

from the [[locally convex space|locally convex]] [[topological vector space]] of compactly supported test functions (def. \ref{CompactlySupportedTestFunctions}) to the [[real numbers]].

The space of distributions on $X$ is denoted $\mathcal{D}'(X)$ (see also remark \ref{NotationForSpaceOfDistributions}). There is an obvious bilinear pairing 

$$
  \array{
    \mathcal{D}'(X) \times C_c^{\infty}(X) &\longrightarrow& \mathbb{R}
    \\
    (S, \phi) &\mapsto& S(\phi)
  }
$$ 

given by [[evaluation]]. 

Often one writes $\langle S, \phi\rangle$ instead of $S(\phi)$. The space of distributions can be given the weak $*$-topology, meaning the smallest topology rendering the maps 

$$\langle -, \phi\rangle \;\colon\; \mathcal{D}'(U) \to \mathbb{R}$$ 

continuous for all test functions $\phi$.  As $C_c^\infty(U)$ is reflexive, this agrees with the weak topology.  

=--

See at _[[locally convex topological vector space]]_ the section _[Continuous linear functionals](locally+convex+space#ContinuousLinearFunctionals)_ for alternative characterizations of the continuity of distributions according to def. \ref{DistributionOnOpenSubsetOfEuclideanSpace}.

Notice that other natural topologies exist, such as [[uniform convergence]] on compact subsets of $C_c^\infty(U)$ (in this case, this agrees with uniform convergence on bounded subsets which usually goes by the name of the *strong* topology).


+-- {: .num_remark #NotationForSpaceOfDistributions}
###### Remark
**(notation)**

On general grounds the symbols $D(X)$ or $\mathcal{D}(X)$ or similar would seem evident notation for the space of distributions on a smooth manifold $X$. However, [[Laurent Schwartz]] in his seminal work ([Schwartz 50](#Schwartz50)) used $\mathcal{D}(X)$ to denote the space $C^\infty_c(X)$ of compactly supported continuous functions, and then $\mathcal{D}'(X)$ for its linear continuous dual, hence for the space of distributions (see also [Hörmander 90, below def. 2.1.1](#Hoermander90)). 

=--

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

If $f \colon X \to \mathbb{R}$ is [[locally integrable function|locally integrable]], then for all test functions $\phi$ the [[Lebesgue integral]] 

$$\langle f, \phi\rangle = \int_X f(x)\phi(x) d x $$ 

is defined; in this way a function $f$ locally integrable over $X$ may be regarded as a distribution on $X$ (explaining both the sense in which distributions are "generalized functions" and a reason for the angle-bracket notation for the evaluation pairing). In particular, there is an obvious inclusion 

$$C_c^{\infty}(X) \hookrightarrow \mathcal{D}'(X)$$ 

and this inclusion turns out to be [[dense subset|dense]]. 

=--

Other notions of spaces of distributions, each endowed with the weak $*$-topology, include 

* [[compactly supported distributions]] on $U$. These are functionals on $C^{\infty}(U)$ (test functions without compact support). 

* [[tempered distributions]] (usually on $U = \mathbb{R}^n$). These are functionals on what is called the _[[Schwartz space]]_ $\mathcal{S}$: the space of smooth functions each of whose [[derivatives]] (of any order) decays rapidly (goes to zero more quickly than any negative power of $|x|$ as $|x| \to \infty$). The topology on Schwartz space is induced by the family of seminorms 
$$\rho_{K, \alpha, \beta}(\phi) = \sup_{x \in K} |x^\alpha \partial^\beta \phi|$$ 
where $\alpha$, $\beta$ are multi-indices. 

* Rapidly decaying distributions (usually on $U = \mathbb{R}^n$). These are functionals on the space of smooth functions each of whose partial derivatives (of any order) has "tempered" or moderate growth (i.e., bounded by polynomial growth). 


+-- {: .num_prop #PullbackOfDistributionAlongSubmersion}
###### Proposition
**([[pullback of distributions]] along [[submersions]])**

If $X_1, X_2 \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ are two [[open subsets]] of [[Euclidean space]], and if

$$
  f \;\colon\; X_1 \overset{}{\longrightarrow} X_2
$$

is a [[submersion]] (i.e. its [[differential]] is a [[surjective function]] $d f_x \;\colon\; T_x X_1 \to T_{f(x)} X_2$ for all $x \in X_1$), then there is a unique [[continuous linear functional]]

$$
  f^\ast \;\colon\; \mathcal{D}'(X_2) \longrightarrow \mathcal{D}'(X_1)
$$

between spaces of distributions (def. \ref{DistributionOnOpenSubsetOfEuclideanSpace}) which extends the [[pullback of functions]] in that on a distribution represented by a [[bump function]] $b$ it is given by precomposition

$$
  f^\ast b = b \circ f
  \,.
$$

This is hence called the _[[pullback of distributions]]_.

**(distributions on smooth manifolds)**

Let $X$ be a [[smooth manifold]]. Then a distribution on $X$ is an [[equivalence class]] of

1. such that for all pairs $(i,j) \in I \times I$ these component distributions are related on intersections of charts by pullback of distributions (def. \ref{PullbackOfDistributionAlongSubmersion}) along the coordinate change maps:

### As smooth linear functionals
 {#CharacterizationByMonads}

Since [[smooth functions]] on [[smooth manifolds]] are the subject of [[differential geometry]], and since spaces of [[smooth functions]] are naturally themselves [[generalized smooth spaces]], it makes sense to ask whether distribution theory is actually a native topic to [[differential geometry]].

In particular we may ask how distributions in the [[functional analysis|functional analytic]] sense relate to the _smooth linear functions_ on smooth spaces of smooth functions. Indeed, with respect to the natural formulation of differential geometry via [[functorial geometry]] ([[topos theory]]) in terms of [[diffeological spaces]], [[smooth sets]] etc. it turns out that distributional densities are equivalently the smooth linear functionals on smooth spaces of smooth functions.

This is discussed at 

* _[[distributions are the smooth linear functionals]]_.

## Operations on distributions 

### Inducing operations by dual extension

As $\mathcal{D}'(U)$ is dual to $C_c^\infty(U)$, each continuous linear operator on $C_c^\infty(U)$ induces a corresponding linear operator on $\mathcal{D}'(U)$ in the obvious way.  Given

$$
F\colon C_c^\infty(U) \to C_c^\infty(U)
$$

we define

$$
F^*\colon \mathcal{D}'(U) \to \mathcal{D}'(U)
$$

according to the usual formula for dualities

$$
F^* S(\phi) = S(F \phi).
$$

However, since there is an obvious inclusion $C_c^\infty(U) \to \mathcal{D}'(U)$ induced by the standard inner product on $C_c^\infty(U)$, what is more usually desired is not this dual operator but an **extension** operator.  That is, instead of $F^*$ we want an operator $F^\dagger \colon \mathcal{D}'(U) \to \mathcal{D}'(U)$ with the property that for $\phi \in C_c^\infty(U)$ then $F^\dagger(\phi) = F(\phi)$ (identifying $C_c^\infty(U)$ with its image in $\mathcal{D}'(U)$).  Being slightly more careful, let us write $\iota \colon C_c^\infty(U) \to \mathcal{D}'(U)$ for the inclusion induced by the inner product.  Then we want $F^\dagger(\iota \phi) = \iota (F(\phi))$.

If the extension exists, we have

$$
F^\dagger(\iota \phi)(\psi) = \iota(F(\phi))(\psi) = \langle F(\phi), \psi \rangle
$$

Now suppose that $F$ has an adjoint, say $F^+$, with respect to the inner product.  Note that this is not automatic since $C_c^\infty(U)$ is not a Hilbert space.  Moreover, even if $F$ extends to the Hilbert completion the Hilbertian adjoint may not work since it may not define a continuous linear map on the subspace $C_c^\infty(U)$.  But if $F^+$ does exist then we have

$$
F^\dagger(\iota \phi)(\psi) = \langle F(\phi), \psi \rangle = \langle \phi, F^+(\psi) \rangle
$$

In this case, the definition of $F^\dagger$ on the whole of $\mathcal{D}'(U)$ is obvious: simply take ${F^+}^*$.  That is, the dual operator to the adjoint to $F$.  In full, $F^\dagger \colon \mathcal{D}'(U) \to \mathcal{D}'(U)$ is defined via the formula

$$
\langle F^\dagger(S),\phi\rangle = \langle S, F^+(\phi) \rangle
$$

If the ground field is $\mathbb{C}$ then this carries through essentially unchanged except for the fact that one does **not** use the inner product on $C_c^\infty(U)$ but rather the associated bilinear pairing

$$
(\phi,\psi) = \int_U \phi \psi
$$

This is to ensure that the inclusion $C_c^\infty(U) \to \mathcal{D}'(U)$ is complex linear and not conjugate linear.  Otherwise extending operators becomes complex.

Two instances are of particular importance: 

* Multiplication by a smooth function $\theta$. If $\theta$ is any smooth function on $U$ (not necessarily compactly supported), then we can define $\theta \cdot S$ by observing that this multiplication is self-adjoint: 
$$\langle \theta \cdot \phi, \psi \rangle = \langle \phi, \psi \cdot \theta\rangle$$
where $\phi, \psi$ are arbitrary test functions.  Thus we define $\theta \cdot S$ by
$$\langle \theta \cdot S, \psi \rangle = \langle S, \theta \cdot \psi$$

* Differentiation. If $\partial^i$ is partial differentiation with respect to the $i^{th}$ coordinate, then for test functions $\psi$, $\phi$ we have 
$$\int_U \partial^i(\psi)(x) \phi(x)\; d x = -\int_U \psi(x) \partial^i(\phi)(x)\; d x$$ 
by simple integration by parts and the fact that $\phi$, $\psi$ are compactly supported.  Thus differentiation is _skew_-adjoint and so we define the extension to distributions by 
$$\langle \partial^i(S), \phi\rangle = -\langle S, \partial^i(\phi) \rangle$$ 
for all test functions $\phi$. In general, 
$$\langle \partial^\alpha S, \phi\rangle = (-1)^{|\alpha|}\langle S, \partial^\alpha \phi \rangle$$
where $|\alpha| = \alpha_1 + \ldots + \alpha_n$ is the total degree of the multi-index. 

Thus derivatives of distributions are defined to all orders. Some examples are given in the section "examples".

### Multiplication of Distributions
 {#MultiplicationsOfDistributions}

See at _[[multiplication of distributions]]_

## Examples 

As explained above, any locally integrable function on $U$ defines a distribution on $U$. Other examples may be produced fairly cheaply by restriction of functionals on various TVS which contain the test functions. 

For instance: if $C_c(U)$ denotes the space of real-valued continuous functions with compact support in $U$ (topologized by uniform convergence on compacta), then a functional $\mu: C_c(U) \to \mathbb{R}$ is essentially the same as a signed measure on $U$ (Riesz-Markov theorem), i.e., there is a unique signed measure $d m$ for which 

$$\mu(\phi) = \int_U \phi d m.$$ 

Since the inclusion $i: C_c^\infty(U) \hookrightarrow C_c(U)$ is continuous, it follows that a measure $\mu$ defines a distribution by simple restriction along $i$: 

$$C_c^\infty(U) \overset{i}{\to} C_c(U) \overset{\mu}{\to} \mathbb{R}$$ 

Specializing further, consider any function of bounded variation on $U = \mathbb{R}$, say a bounded monotone increasing function $\alpha$. Then the Riemann-Stieltjes integral 

$$\int_{\mathbb{R}} f(x) d\alpha(x)$$ 

is defined for all functions $f$ with compact support; this provides a measure $d\alpha$ and hence a distribution. 

A prototypical example of this is provided by the Heaviside function: $H(x) = 1$ if $x \gt 0$, else 0. ("Heaviside": what a great pun!) Here we have, for all $f \in C_c(\mathbb{R})$, 

$$\langle f, d H \rangle = \int_{\mathbb{R}} f(x) d H(x) = f(0)$$ 

As a distribution, the Heaviside measure is the famous **[[Dirac distribution]]**. The long-standing intuitive practice among physicists and engineers is to write 

$$d H(x) = \delta_0(x) d x$$ 

where of course the function $H(x)$ doesn't have a derivative in the classical sense (i.e., as a function), but as a distribution, it does. Meanwhile, $H(x)$ is itself the derivative of a continuous function: $G(x) = \max\{x, 0\}$. 

For an example of a distribution on $\mathbb{R}$ which does not arise from a measure, consider the derivative of the Dirac distribution. (As a functional, it maps a test function $\phi$ to $-\phi'(0)$.) 

These examples are by no means curiosities. A fairly deep theorem is that _every_ distribution arises as a linear combination of derivatives of continuous functions:  

**Theorem:** Let $S$ be a distribution on an open domain $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$. Then, there exist a finite collection $A$ of multi-indices $\alpha$ and continuous functions $g_\alpha$ defined on $U$ for which 

$$S = \sum_{\alpha \in A} \partial^\alpha g_\alpha$$ 

## Applications 

Distributions rigorously address a need long-felt by physicists to mathematically represent objects such as point particles of mass $m$ at position $a$ (where one would use the distribution $m\delta(x-a)$). They thus appear in accounts of quantum theory which attempt to achieve mathematical rigor. An example of this tendency can be seen in axiomatic formulations of quantum field theory such as the [[Wightman axioms]]. 

A brief survey of applications of distribution theory to perturbative quantum field theory may be found [here](http://www1.jinr.ru/Archive/Pepan/v-31-7a/I_ktp_04_t.pdf). 
  

Within mathematics, distributions are quite commonplace; for example, de Rham appropriated them for his theory of [[current]]s. Distribution theory has also long been used in the theory of partial differential equations. Here is a sample theorem: 

* **Theorem (Ehrenpreis, Malgrange):** Let $D$ be a linear differential operator on $\mathbb{R}^n$ with constant coefficients. Given a compactly supported smooth function $f$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$, there exists a smooth solution $u$ to the equation $D u = f$. 

A proof is given in these [notes](http://www-math.mit.edu/~helgason/hormander.pdf) by Helgason. The basic idea is to prove there exists a **fundamental solution** of $D$, i.e., a distribution $T$ such that $D T = \delta_0$. Then $u = f * T$ is smooth. The existence of a fundamental solution involves a theorem of Paley-Wiener type. 

## Variants

### In synthetic differential geometry 

There is another point of view on distributions: that they _can_ be modeled by actual functions provided that one admits infinite and infinitesimal quantities of the type used in Robinson [[nonstandard analysis]]. One particular approach is to formulate axiomatically the theory of distributions so that it can be interpreted in [[smooth toposes]] that model the axioms of [[synthetic differential geometry]] and support a suitable notion of invertible [[infinitesimal object]]s and infinitely large integers.

This is discussed in ([Moerdijk-Reyes 91](#MoerdijkReyes91)).

which closely mirrors the original treatment in Robinson's book Non-standard Analysis. Examples of models that support these axioms are the toposes $\mathcal{Z}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ described there. 

### Currents

In $\mathbb{R}^n$ the distributions and generalized functions boil down to the same thing, so the terminology identifies them. But on a manifold, the distributions/generalized densities (functionals on test functions) and generalized functions (functionals on test *densities*) do not agree. See V. Guillemin, S. Sternberg: _Geometric asymptotics_ ([free online](http://www.ams.org/online_bks/surv14)). While generalized functions pull back, distributions/generalized densities push forward (under some conditions, though). 

More generally one can study generalized differential $k$-forms in local coordinates they look like $\sum f_\alpha dx^{\alpha_1}\wedge \cdot \wedge dx^{\alpha_k}$. Usually they are called **currents**. They are useful e.g. in the study of higher dimensional residua in higher dimensional complex geometry (cf. *Principles of algebraic geometry* by Griffiths and Harris) and in geometric measure theory (cf. the monograph by Federer).  

### Hyperfunctions and Coulombeau distributions

Sometimes one considers larger spaces of distributions, where worse singularities than in Schwarz theory are allowed. Most well known are the theory of _[[hyperfunctions]]_ and the theory of **Coulombeau distributions**. 

### Distributions from nonstandard analysis

Distributions can be alternatively described using [[nonstandard analysis]], see there.

Generalized functions were introduced by S. L. Sobolev in 1935, and independently (under the name _distributions_) by [[Laurent Schwartz]] in the 1940's, who unaware of Sobolev's work developed an extensive theory for them. For an infinite-dimensional variant used in the foundation of Feynman [[path integral]] see also [[Connes distribution]].
