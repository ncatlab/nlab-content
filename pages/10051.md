## Idea 

The _Wiener measure_ is a [[measure]] on the [[space]] of [[continuous function|continuous paths]] in a given [[manifold]].

The Wiener measure serves to make precise the [[path integral quantization]] for the (charged) [[particle]]. 

## References

A textbook account in the context of [[path integral quantization]] is around p. 49 in
