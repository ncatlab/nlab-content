## Idea 

The _Wiener measure_ is a [[measure]] on the [[topological space|space]] of [[continuous function|continuous paths]] in a given [[manifold]]. The [[Lebesgue integral]] with respect to Wiener's measure is called the __Wiener integral__.

The Wiener measure serves to make precise the [[path integral quantization]] for the (charged) non-relativistic [[particle]] (that of the [[relativistic particle]] may be amenable to Wiener measure methods via [[Wick rotation]], i.e. analytic continuation to [[imaginary number|imaginary]] time. ).
