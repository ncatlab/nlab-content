## Idea 

The _Wiener measure_ is a [[measure]] on the [[space]] of [[continuous function|continuous paths]] in a given [[manifold]]. The Lebesgue integral with respect to Wiener's measure is called the __Wiener integral__.

The Wiener measure serves to make precise the [[path integral quantization]] for the (charged) [[particle]]. 

However, the true path integral, if viewed in this approach, requires Wick rotation, that is an analytic continuation to imaginary time.
