I'm a [lecturer](http://www.kent.ac.uk/secl/philosophy/staff/corfield.html) in [[philosophy|philosophy]] in the School of European Culture of Languages at the University of Kent.

Chapter 10 of my book [Towards a Philosophy of Real Mathematics](http://www.amazon.com/Towards-Philosophy-Mathematics-David-Corfield/dp/0521817226) treats some aspects of higher-dimensional category theory.

On my old blog I began a discussion on [[Klein 2-geometry|Klein 2-geometry]], which I continued at the $n$-Category Caf&eacute;.
