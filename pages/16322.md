## Idea

A _reflexive object_ is a model of the pure (untyped) [[lambda calculus]] validating the $\beta$ law (and sometimes also the $\eta$ law) as an equation between morphisms.

## Definition

A **reflexive object** in a [[cartesian closed category]] is an object $U$ equipped with a pair of maps

$$
\array{U & \overset{a}{\underset{\ell}{\rightleftarrows}} & U^U} 
$$

such that $a \circ \ell = 1$.  In other words, a reflexive object is an object $U$ together with data $U^U \lhd U$ exhibiting $U^U$ as a [[retract]] of $U$.   A reflexive object is said to be **strict** (or **extensional**) when also $\ell \circ a = 1$, so that there is an isomorphism $U^U \cong U$.

### In a closed (symmetric) monoidal category

The definition has a straightforward generalization to any (not necessarily [[cartesian monoidal category|cartesian]]) [[symmetric monoidal closed category]], where we just replace the exponential object $U^U$ by the [[internal hom]] $[U,U]$.  Indeed, the definition also makes sense in any left-closed or right-closed monoidal category.

A reflexive object in a symmetric monoidal closed category provides a model of [[linear lambda calculus]].

### In a closed monoidal 2-category

The definition of reflexive object also has a natural generalization to any closed monoidal [[2-category]] (or cartesian closed 2-category), where the retraction is replaced by an [[adjunction]] $a \dashv \ell : [U,U] \to U$.  Then the [[counit]] of the adjunction $a \circ \ell \Rightarrow 1_U$ models [[beta-reduction]], while the [[unit]] $1_{[U,U]} \Rightarrow \ell \circ a$ models [[eta-expansion]].

## Examples

### Terminal object

The [[terminal object]] of a ccc provides a degenerate example of a (strict) reflexive object, and for cardinality reasons, this is the only reflexive object in [[Set]].

### Scott's lattice model

A non-degenerate model of untyped lambda calculus was first described by [[Dana Scott]], who solved the cardinality issue by replacing sets with [[algebraic lattices]], and arbitrary set-theoretic functions by [[Scott topology|Scott-continuous]] functions.  In ([Scott 1976](#Scott76)), he constructed a (non-strict) reflexive object with carrier the lattice $P\omega$ of all [[subsets]] of the non-negative integers, and with the maps $a$ and $\ell$ (there called "fun" and "graph") defined as follows:

$$a(u)(x) = \{m \mid \exists e_n \subseteq x. (n,m) \in u\}$$

$$\ell(f) = \{(n,m) \mid m \in f(e_n)\}$$

Here $e_n$ stands for the set whose elements are the exponents in the binary expansion of $n$ (thus $e_n$ is the $n$th subset in the standard enumeration of finite subsets of $\omega$), while "$(n,m)$" stands for the standard enumeration of pairs of integers

$$(n,m) = \frac{1}{2}(n+m)(n+m+1)+m$$

### Free model

One way of looking at the _free_ cartesian closed category containing a reflexive object is as a representation of pure lambda terms (up to $\beta$-equality) in the style of so-called [[higher-order abstract syntax]].  The operation $a : U \to U^U$ is the [[currying|curried]] form of application, while the operation $\ell : U^U \to U$ represents lambda abstraction.  The [[global elements]] of $U$ can be interpreted as closed lambda terms, and more generally, morphisms $U^n \to U$ can be interpreted as terms with $n$ free variables.
