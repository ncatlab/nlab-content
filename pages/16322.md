## Idea

A _reflexive object_ is a model of the pure (untyped) [[lambda calculus]] validating the $\beta$ equation (and sometimes also the $\eta$ equation).

## Definition

A **reflexive object** in a [[cartesian closed category]] is an object $D$ equipped with a pair of maps

$$
\array{D & \overset{a}{\underset{\ell}{\rightleftarrows}} & D^D} 
$$

such that $a \circ \ell = 1$.  In other words, a reflexive object is an object $D$ together with data exhibiting $D^D$ as a [[retract]] of $D$.   A reflexive object is said to be *strict* when this is actually an isomorphism $D \cong D^D$.  Note that this definition may be naturally generalized to any [[closed category]], not necessarily cartesian.
