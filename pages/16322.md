## Idea

A _reflexive object_ is a model of the pure (untyped) [[lambda calculus]] validating the $\beta$ equation (and sometimes also the $\eta$ equation).

## Definition

A **reflexive object** in a [[cartesian closed category]] is an object $U$ equipped with a pair of maps

$$
\array{U & \overset{a}{\underset{\ell}{\rightleftarrows}} & U^U} 
$$

such that $a \circ \ell = 1$.  In other words, a reflexive object is an object $U$ together with data exhibiting $U^U$ as a [[retract]] of $U$.   A reflexive object is said to be *strict* when this is actually an isomorphism $U \cong U^U$.  Note that this definition may be naturally generalized to any [[closed category]], not necessarily cartesian.

## Examples

The [[terminal object]] of a ccc provides a degenerate example of a (strict) reflexive object, and for cardinality reasons, this is the only reflexive object in [[Set]].

A non-degenerate model of untyped lambda calculus was first described by [[Dana Scott]], who solved the cardinality issue by replacing sets with [[algebraic lattices]], and arbitrary set-theoretic functions by [[Scott topology|Scott-continuous]] functions.  In ([Scott 1976](#Scott76)), he constructed a (non-strict) reflexive object with carrier the lattice $P\omega$ of all [[subsets]] of the non-negative integers, and with the maps $a$ and $\ell$ (called "fun" and "graph") defined as follows:

$$a(u)(x) = \{m \mid \exists e_n \subseteq x. (n,m) \in u\}$$

$$\ell(f) = \{(n,m) \mid m \in f(e_n)\}$$

Here $e_n$ stands for the set whose elements are the exponents in the binary expansion of $n$ (thus $e_n$ is the $n$th subset in the standard enumeration of finite subsets of $\omega$), while "$(n,m)$" stands for the standard enumeration of pairs of integers

$$(n,m) = \frac{1}{2}(n+m)(n+m+1)+m$$
