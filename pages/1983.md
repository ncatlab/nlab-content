# Summary #

The book discusses the construction and the properties of [[smooth topos]]es $(\mathcal{T},R)$ that model the axioms of [[synthetic differential geometry]] and are _well-adapted_ to [[differential geometry]] in that there is a [[full and faithful functor]] $Diff \to \mathcal{T}$ embedding the [[category]] [[Diff]] of smooth [[manifold]]s into the more general catgeory $\mathcal{T}$.

All models are obtained as [[category of sheaves|categories of sheaves]] on [[site]]s whose underlying category is a [[subcategory]] of that of [[smooth loci]].

#Models#

The following tabulates various models for [[smooth topos]]es and lists their properties.

## the topos $\mathcal{G}$ ##

## the topos $\mathcal{F}$ ##

## the topos $\mathcal{Z}$ ##

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

$\mathcal{Z} := Sh_{fin-open}(\mathbb{L})$ is the [[category of sheaves]] on the entire [[site]] $\mathbb{L}$ of [[smooth locus|smooth loci]] with [[cover]]ing [[sieve]]s given by finite open covers (...explain...).

=--

+-- {: .um_prop}
###### Proposition
**(properties)**

For the [[topos]] $\mathcal{Z}$ the following is true.

* the [[Grothendieck topology]] is [[subcanonical coverage|subcanonical]]

* the [[category]] [[Diff]] of smooth [[manifold]]s embeds [[full and faithful functor|full and faithfully]], $Diff \hookrightarrow \mathcal{Z}$

  (chapter VI, corollary 1.4)

* the general [[Kock-Lawvere axiom]] holds 

  (chapter VI, 1.9)

* the [[integration axiom]] holds
  
  (chapter VI, 1.10)

* it models [[nonstandard analysis]] in that

  * since the topology is subcanonical, in particular the
    [[smooth locus]] 
    $\ell(C^\infty(\mathbb{R}-{0})/(f|germ_0(f) = 0))$ 
    of the ring of restrictions of germs at 0 to $\mathbb{R}-{0}$
    is an object: the object of **invertible infinitesimals**.

  * due the conditions that covers are finite, 
    the [[smooth locus]] $N := \ell C^\infty(\mathbb{N})$
    does not coincide with the [[natural numbers object]]
    of the topos: this _object of smooth natural numbers_ 
    contains the standard natural numbers and in addition contains
    infinitely large numbers.

    In fact the [[natural numbers object]] 
    (the [[sheafification]] of the [[presheaf]] constant on 
    $\mathbb{N} \in Set$) is the [[sheaf]]
    that assigns to the smooth locus 
    $\ell C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)/I$ the locally constant and
    _bounded_ functions to $\mathbb{N}$ from the zero-sets
    of finitely generated subideals of $I$, with two such
    functions taken to be the same if they agree on the 
    zero-set of a subideal containing both subideals

###### Definition
**(chapter VI, 5.1)**

$\mathcal{B} := Sh_{fin-open/proj}(\mathbb{L})$ is the [[category of sheaves]] on the [[site]] $\mathbb{L}$ of [[smooth locus|smooth loci]] with [[cover]]ing [[sieve]]s given by finite open covers together with projections $\ell A \times \ell B \to \ell A$.

###### Proposition
**(properties)**

For the [[topos]] $\mathcal{B}$ the following is true. 
    
* the [[Grothendieck topology]] is [[subcanonical coverage|subcanonical]]
  
  (chapter VI, 5.2)
    
* the [[category]] [[Diff]] of smooth [[manifold]]s embeds [[full and faithful functor|full and faithfully]], $Diff \hookrightarrow \mathcal{B}$

  (chapter VI, 5.2)
    
* the general [[Kock-Lawvere axiom]] holds
  
  (chapter VI, below 5.4)
 
* the [[integration axiom]] holds
  
  (chapter VI, below 5.4)
    
* a version of [[nonstandard analysis]] is realized
