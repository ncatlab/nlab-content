# Summary #

The book discusses the construction and the properties of [[smooth topos]]es $(\mathcal{T},R)$ that model the axioms of [[synthetic differential geometry]] and are _well-adapted_ to [[differential geometry]] in that there is a [[full and faithful functor]] $Diff \to \mathcal{T}$ embedding the [[category]] [[Diff]] of smooth [[manifold]]s into the more general catgeory $\mathcal{T}$.

All models are obtained as [[category of sheaves|categories of sheaves]] on [[site]]s whose underlying category is a [[subcategory]] of that of [[smooth loci]].

#Models#

The following tabulates various models for [[smooth topos]]es and lists their properties.

###### Definition


$\mathcal{Z} := Sh_{fin-open}(\mathbb{L})$ is the [[category of sheaves]] on the entire [[site]] $\mathbb{L}$ of [[smooth locus|smooth loci]] where the [[cover]]ing [[sieve]]s of any [[smooth locus]] $\ell A$ are those generated by covering families 

$$
  \{f_i : \ell A_i  \to \ell A\}
$$

given by a _finite_ collection of elements $(a_i \in A)_{i=1}^n$ such that the ideal generated by these elements contains the unit, $1 \in (a_1, \cdots, a_n)$, and for each $i$ a commutative diagram

$$
  \array{
    \ell A_i &&\stackrel{\simeq}{\to}&&  \ell (A\{a_i^{-1}\})
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{f_i}}\searrow && \swarrow
    \\
    &&
    \ell A
  }
  \,,
$$ 

where the right diagonal morphism is the canonical inclusion of a smooth locus corresponding to a [[generalized smooth algebra|smooth ring]] with one element inverted.

This is in chapter VI, 1. Inversion of elements is described around proposition 1.6 in chapter I. 

For instance for $\ell A = R = \ell C^\infty(\mathbb{R})$ the real line, a covering family is given by maps from two further copies of the real line $f_{1,2} : R \to R$ determined by any two smooth functions $a_1, a_1 \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R})$ with support  $(-\infty,1)$ and $(-1,\infty)$. By proposition 1.6 in chapter I we have $C^\infty(\mathbb{R})\{a_1^{-1}\} = C^\infty((-\infty,1))$ and $C^\infty(\mathbb{R})\{a_2^{-1}\} = C^\infty((-1,\infty))$. As both these open intervals are diffeomorphic to the real line, and as [[Diff]] embeds fully, we have isomorphisms $R \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} \ell(C^\infty(\mathbb{R}/{a_i^{-1}})$. Hence the cover defined by $(a_i, a_2)$ is the ordinary open cover of the real line by the two open subsets $(-\infty,1)$ and $(-1,\infty)$.

###### Proposition
**(properties)**

For the [[topos]] $\mathcal{Z}$ the following is true.

* the [[Grothendieck topology]] is [[subcanonical coverage|subcanonical]]

* the [[category]] [[Diff]] of smooth [[manifold]]s embeds [[full and faithful functor|full and faithfully]], $Diff \hookrightarrow \mathcal{Z}$

  (chapter VI, corollary 1.4)

* the general [[Kock-Lawvere axiom]] holds 

  (chapter VI, 1.9)

* the [[integration axiom]] holds
  
  (chapter VI, 1.10)

* it models [[nonstandard analysis]] in that

  * since the topology is subcanonical, in particular the
    [[smooth locus]] 
    $\ell(C^\infty(\mathbb{R}-{0})/(f|germ_0(f) = 0))$ 
    of the ring of restrictions of germs at 0 to $\mathbb{R}-{0}$
    is an object: the object of **invertible infinitesimals**.

  * due the conditions that covers are finite, 
    the [[smooth locus]] $N := \ell C^\infty(\mathbb{N})$
    -- which is such that functions to it are arbitrary 
    locally constant $\mathbb{N}$-valued functions --
    does not coincide with the [[natural numbers object]]
    of the topos, which is the [[sheafification]] of the
    [[presheaf]] constant on $\mathbb{N} \in Set$:

    since covering families are by _finite_ covers 
    it follows that maps into the sheafification of 
    the presheaf constant on $\mathbb{N}$ are _bounded_
    smooth $\mathbb{N}$-valued functions, 
    instead of all such functions.

    (chapter VI, 1.6)

    The object $N = \ell C^\infty(\mathbb{N})$ is called the
    object of **[[smooth natural numbers]]** . It may be thought
    of as containing "infinite natural numbers".

**(chapter VI, 5.1)**

$\mathcal{B} := Sh_{fin-open/proj}(\mathbb{L})$ is the [[category of sheaves]] on the [[site]] $\mathbb{L}$ of [[smooth locus|smooth loci]] with [[cover]]ing [[sieve]]s given by finite open covers together with projections $\ell A \times \ell B \to \ell A$.
