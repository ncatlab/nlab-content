{: toc}

## Idea

In material [[set theory]], the _axiom of extensionality_ says that the global membership relation $\in$ is an [[extensional relation]] on the class of all [[pure sets]].

Since any relation becomes extensional on its [[extensional quotient]], one can interpret this axiom as a definition of [[equality]].  However, because the extensional quotient map need not reflect the relation, there is still content to the axiom: if two sets would be identified in the extensional quotient, then they must be members of the same sets and have the same sets as members.

If one models [[pure sets]] in structural [[set theory]], then this property may be made to hold by construction.


## Statements

In the context of the [[axiom of foundation]], we may use [[weak extensionality]], simplifying the statement.

Taking [[equality]] as a primitive:

+-- {: .num_axiom}
###### Axiom

If two sets have the same members, then they are equal.
=--

Or taking equality as defined:

+-- {: .num_axiom}
###### Axiom

If two sets have the same members, then they are members of the same sets.
=--

Here we define two sets to be equal if they have the same members.

Note that we may prove, using the [[axiom of separation]] (bounded separation is enough) that two sets must be equal if they are members of the same sets.
