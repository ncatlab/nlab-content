## Definition

A __simple Lie group__ is a [[connected space|connected]] [[Lie group]] with exactly two connected [[normal subgroups]] that is not [[abelian group|abelian]].


## Remarks

This is *not* the same thing as a [[simple object]] in [[LieGrp]] (or even in $Conn Lie Grp$).  However, the [[Lie algebra]] associated to a simple Lie group is always a [[simple Lie algebra]] (although that definition also requires a non-abelian clause).


## Classification

The classification of simple Lie groups consists of four infinite series -- the [[classical Lie group]]s -- and five separate cases -- the [[exceptional Lie group]]s.

See Wikipedia\'s [list of simple Lie groups](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_simple_Lie_groups).
