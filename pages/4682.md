## Definition

A __simple Lie group__ is a non-[[abelian group|abelian]] [[connected space|connected]] [[Lie group]] $G$ with no nontrivial [[connected space|connected]] [[normal subgroups]].

Via [[Lie's theorems]] this is equivalent to the [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ of $G$ being a [[simple Lie algebra]] (over the [[real numbers]]).

###### Remark

This is *not* the same thing as a [[simple object]] in [[LieGrp]] (or even in $Conn Lie Grp$).  However, the [[Lie algebra]] associated to a simple Lie group is always a [[simple Lie algebra]] (although that definition also requires a non-abelian clause).

## Classification

The classification of simple Lie groups consists of four infinite series -- the [[classical Lie group]]s -- and five separate cases -- the [[exceptional Lie group]]s.

See Wikipedia\'s [list of simple Lie groups](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_simple_Lie_groups).

## Examples

* The [[special unitary group]] $SU(N+1)$ is simple for all $N \geq 1$.

* The [[special orthogonal group]] $SO(n)$ is simple at least for $n \geq 8$ (corresponding to [[SO(8)]]), hence so are the corresponding [[spin groups]].
