## Idea

A _filter space_ is a generalisation of a [[topological space]] based on the concept of [[convergence]] of [[filters]] (or [[nets]]) as fundamental.  The [[category]] of filter spaces is a [[quasitopos]] and may be thought of as a [[nice category of spaces]] that includes [[Top]] as a [[full subcategory]]. Filter spaces include [[convergence spaces]] and [[limit spaces]] as a full sub ccc.
