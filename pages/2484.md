## Idea

In [[algebraic geometry]], there are two equivalent ways of looking at a [[scheme]]: it can be viewed as a [[petit topos]] with a [[structure sheaf]] of [[commutative rings]] (i.e. [[locally ringed space]]), or as an object of the [[gros topos]] of [[sheaves]] on the [[site]] of [[commutative rings]] with the [[Zariski topology]]. In other words, a [[scheme]] may be identified with the [[sheaf]] it represents; this sheaf is called the _functor of points_ of the scheme.

The functor of points approach has the advantage of making certain constructions much simpler (e.g. the [[fibered product]] in the category of schemes), and eliminating the need for certain constructions like the [[Zariski spectrum]]. In his famous 1973 Buffalo Colloquium talk, [[Alexander Grothendieck]] urged that his earlier definition of scheme via [[locally ringed spaces]] should be abandoned in favour of the functorial point of view.

Of course, the above discussion generalizes to other types of [[geometry]] and even [[higher geometry]].

##Example

The functor from commutative rings to sets which sends a ring, $R$, to the set of simultaneous solutions in $R^n$ of a set of polynomials, $f_1, \ldots, f_k$ in $\mathbb{Z}[t_1, \ldots,t_n]$ corresponds to the affine scheme $X = Spec(\mathbb{Z}[t_1, \ldots,t_n]/(f_1, \ldots,f_k))$. These $R$-points are then equivalently the hom-space

$$
Hom_{schemes}(Spec(R), X).
$$

The functor which sends $R$ to the points of the projective space $\mathbb{P}^n_R$ corresponds to a non-affine scheme.
