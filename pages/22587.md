## Idea

In [[ODE]]/[[PDE]]-theory, what is known as the *homtopy analysis method* ([Liao 92](#Liao92)) is a method for solving a *non-linear* [[differential equation]] $N_x u(x) = 0$ by considering its [[convex combination]] with a suitably chosen [[linear differential equation]] $L_x \big(u(x) - u_0(x)\big) = 0$ and then solving the combined equation

\[
 \label{CombinationOfDifferentialEquations}
  q \cdot N_x u(x,q)
  \;+\;
  (1-q) \cdot L_x\big(u(x,q) - u_0(x,q)\big)
  \;=\;
  0
  \,,
  {\phantom{AAA}}
  for\; q \in [0,1]
\]

in terms of a [[Taylor series]]-expansion of the desired solution $u$ in the new parameter $q$ ("homotopy Maclaurin series"). This transforms the original non-linear problem into an infinite sequence of [[linear differential equations]], that can (apparently) often be solved more readily.

The terminology "homotopy analysis method" alludes to regarding the  [[convex combination]] (eq:CombinationOfDifferentialEquations) as a "[[homotopy]] of [[differential equations]]" from the linear $L$ (at $q = 0$) to the non-linear $N$ (at $q = 1$). But it seems that there is no actual [[homotopy theory]] being used in discussion of the "homotopy analysis method".
