# Rig categories

## Idea

Recall that a [[rig]] is a '[[ring]] without negatives': a [[monoid object]] in the [[monoidal category]] of [[commutative monoids]] with the usual [[tensor product]].  [[categorification|Categorifying]] this notion, we obtain various notions of _[[2-rig]]_.  One of these, in which both "addition" and "multiplication" are represented by abstract [[monoidal category|monoidal structures]], is the notion of *rig category*, also known as a *bimonoidal category*.

A typical example would be the [[groupoid]] of [[finite set|finite sets]] and [[bijection|bijections]], with [[disjoint union]] playing the role of addition and [[cartesian product]] playing the role of multiplication.  This rig category can be thought of as a categorification of the set of [[natural numbers]].  Note that in this example, disjoint union is _not_ the categorical [[coproduct]], and product of sets is _not_ the categorical [[product]] (because we are working in the *groupoid* of finite sets).

## Definition

A **rig category**, or **bimonoidal category**, $C$ is a category with a [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal]] structure $(C,\oplus,0)$ for addition and a [[monoidal category|monoidal]] structure $(C, \otimes, I)$ for multiplication, together with left and right distributivity natural isomorphisms

$$ d_\ell : x \otimes (y \oplus z) \to 
(x \otimes y) \oplus (x \otimes z) $$

$$ d_r : (x \oplus y) \otimes z \to 
(x \otimes z) \oplus (y \otimes z) $$

satisfying a set of coherence laws worked out in ([Laplaza 72](#Laplaza72)) and ([Kelly74](#Kelly74)).

Note that these authors used the term 'ring category'.  We take the liberty of switching to 'rig category' because it is typical for these to lack additive inverses.

While a rig can have the [[extra property]] of being [[commutative ring|commutative]], a rig category can have the [[extra structure]] of being [[braided monoidal category|braided]] and may then have the further property of being [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]].

## Examples

Rig categories are part of the hierarchy of [[distributivity for monoidal structures]].  If $\oplus$ is the categorical [[coproduct]] and $\otimes$ is the categorical [[product]], then we have the notion of a [[distributive category]], which is a special case of a rig category.  For example, $Set$ (or any [[topos]]) is a distributive category, hence a rig category with $\times$ and $+$.

In between, we have the notion of [[distributive monoidal category]], where $\oplus$ is the coproduct but $\otimes$ is an abstract monoidal structure.  Examples of this sort include [[Ab]], $R$[[Mod]], and [[Vect]].

## Baez's conjecture

+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Conjecture ([[John Baez]])

Using the correct definition of the 2-category of symmetric rig categories, the groupoid $FinSet^{\times}$ of finite sets and bijections is the [[initial object|initial]] symmetric rig category, just as $\N$ is the initial commutative rig.   Note that a suitably weakened concept of 'initial' is needed here; see [[2-limit]].  In other words, given any symmetric rig category $R$, there is a unique symmetric rig morphism $FinSet^{\times} \to R$, up to an [[equivalence]] which is itself unique up to an [[isomorphism]] which is actually unique (up to [[equality]]).

  * If the distributivity morphisms are not invertible, then we have the notion of [[colax-distributive rig category]].

  * [[duoidal category]]

  * [[2-rig]]

* The notion of a [[bipermutative category]] is a strictification of the notion of [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]] rig category.  Every symmetric rig category is equivalent to a bipermutative category ([May, prop. VI 3.5]).  Similarly, every rig category is equivalent to a strict rig category ([Guillou, theorem 1.2](#Guillou)).
