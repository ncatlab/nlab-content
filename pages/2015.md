A subset $S$ of a [[topological space]] $X$ is __irreducible subset__ if it can not be expressed as union of two proper closed subsets. An __irreducible topological space__ is a topological space which is its own irreducible subset. An [[algebraic variety]] is irreducible if its underlying topological space (in Zariski topology) is irreducible.
