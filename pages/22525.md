## Idea

A *regular tesselation* or *tiling* is a [[covering]] of a [[plane]] by [[regular polygons]] (the tiles), so that polygons overlap only on their [[boundary]] and such the same number of tiles meet at each [[vertex]].

A tesselation by regular $n$-gons such that $k$ of them meet at each [[vertex]] is denoted by the [[Schl√§fli symbol]] $\{n,k\}$.

### Euclidean tesselation

For example $\{3,6\}$, $\{4,4\}$ and $\{6,3\}$ denote the familiar tilings of the [[Euclidean plane]] by [[triangles]], [[squares]] and [[hexagons]], respectively. In fact these are all tesselations of the Euclidean plane which exist.

### Hyperbolic tesselations

Similarly a *hyperbologic tesselation* is such a tiling of the [[hyperbolic plane]] by [[regular polygons]]. In contrast to the Euclidean case, there are infinitely many different such tesselations.

For example the hyperbolic tesselation $\{5,4\}$ by [[pentagons]]:

In discussion of [[holographic entanglement entropy]] and [[quantum error correcting codes]] this controls the [[HaPPY code]], see also [JGPE 19](Majorana+dimer+code#JGPE19).

Or the hyperbolic tesselation $\{4,6\}$ by [[squares]]:
