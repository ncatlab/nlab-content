## Idea

The concept of _spectral super-scheme_ is supposed to be the refinement of the concept of [[super-scheme]] as one passes to [[spectral geometry]] in the sense of [[derived algebraic geometry]] over [[E-infinity rings]] ([[E-infinity geometry]]).

## Definition

One way to define this is as follows:


Observe that 

1. [[E-∞ geometry]] is _already in itself_ a [[higher geometry|higher geometry]] version of $\mathbb{Z}$-graded supergeometry (in the sense discussed at _[[geometry of physics -- superalgebra]]_). Because a [[homotopy commutative ring spectrum]] $E$ (i.e., via the [[Brown representability theorem]], a [[multiplicative cohomology theory|multiplicative]] [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology|generalized cohomology theory]]), then its [[stable homotopy groups]] $\pi_\bullet(E)$ inherit the structure of a $\mathbb{Z}$-graded super-commutative ring  (according to [this](geometry+of+physics+--+superalgebra#SupercommutativeSuperalgebraZGraded)). See at _[[Introduction to Stable homotopy theory]]_ in the section [1-2 Homotopy commutative ring spectra](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+1-2#HomotopyRingSpectra) [this proposition](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+1-2#HomotopyGroupsOfHomotopyCommutativeRingSpectrum).

1. Ordinary $\mathbb{Z}/2$-graded [[supercommutative superalgebra]] is equivalently $\mathbb{Z}$-graded supercommutative superalgebra over the free even periodic $\mathbb{Z}$-graded supercommutative superalgebra ([this prop.](geometry+of+physics+--+superalgebra#ModulesOverRbeta))


Here in view of the first point, the second point has an evident analog in [[E-∞ geometry]]: The higher/derived analog of an even periodic $\mathbb{Z}$-graded commutative algebra is an [[E-infinity algebras]] over an [[even cohomology theory|even]] [[periodic ring spectrum]].

That [[E-infinity algebras]] over [[even cohomology theory|even]] [[periodic ring spectra]] are usefully regarded from the point of view of [[supercommutative superalgebra]] was highlighted in [Rezk 09, section 2](#Rezk09).

Hence it makes sense to define spectral/$E_\infty$ super-geometry simply to be [[E-∞ geometry]] over [[even cohomology theory|even]] [[periodic ring spectra]].
