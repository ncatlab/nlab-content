## Idea

In the [[mechanics]] of [[rigid body dynamics]] in [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$, the _moment of inertia_ of a [[rigid body]] is the analog of [[mass]] for [[rotational dynamics]].  In [[linear dynamics]], we have the formula
$$ \vec p = m \vec v $$
which says that the [[momentum]] $\vec p$ is proportional to the [[velocity]] $\vec v$.  Similarly, in rotational dynamics, we have the analogous formula
$$ L = I \Omega $$
where $L$ is the [[angular momentum]], $\Omega$ is the [[angular velocity]], and $I$ is the moment of inertia.

However, the rotational equation is somewhat more complicated than the linear one: firstly because $L$ and $\Omega$ are not naturally vectors but [[bivectors]]; and secondly because they are not necessarily proportional, so that $I$ cannot be a scalar.  In general, the moment of inertia is a [[linear function]]
$$
  I \colon \wedge^2 \mathbb{R}^n \to \wedge^2 \mathbb{R}^n
$$
so that the above equation becomes simply
$$ L = I(\Omega). $$
This linear function is additionally *symmetric* with respect to the induced inner product on $\wedge^2 \mathbb{R}^n$, so it can be represented in coordinates by a symmetric $\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \times \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ matrix.

Similarly, differentiating this equation once, we have
$$ \tau = I(\alpha) $$
relating the [[torque]] $\tau$ to the [[angular acceleration]] $\alpha$ --- this is the rotational analogue of [[Newton's second law]] $F = m a$.

### In low dimensions

In low dimensions, the situation can be (and usually is) simplified.

* In two dimensions, bivectors form a one-dimensional vector space, so that the moment of inertia is simply a scalar.

* In three dimensions, bivectors form a three-dimensional vector space, so that the moment of inertia can be represented by a symmetric $3\times 3$ matrix.  Additionally, in three dimensions, there is an isomorphism between bivectors and vectors (once we choose a [[volume form]], which in particular implies an [[orientation]]); so that angular velocity and momentum can be (and usually are) identified with vectors, and the moment of inertia with a symmetric rank-2 [[tensor]].


## Definition

### In Hamiltonian dynamics

In terms of the discussion at [[Hamiltonian dynamics on Lie groups]], the [[rigid body dynamics]] in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is given by Hamiltonian motion on the [[special orthogonal group]] $SO(n)$. It is defined by any [[left invariant]] [[Riemannian metric]]

$$
  \langle -,-\rangle \in Sym^2_{C^\infty(G)} \Gamma(T G) 
$$

hence a bilinear non-degenarate form on the [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{so}(n)$ (not necessarily the [[Killing form]]).

This bilinear form is the moment of inertia. (For instance [AbrahamMarsden, section 4.6](#AbrahamMarsden).)

### In terms of mass density

If a [[rigid body]] has [[mass]] density $\rho$, then its moment of inertia about the [[origin]] is defined, as a function of $\Omega$, by the $n$-dimensional integral
$$ \int \rho \vec{x} \wedge (\vec{x} \cdot \Omega) \,d^n x $$
over all space, where $\vec{x}$ is the vector from the origin to the point of integration, $\cdot$ denotes the "interior product" of a vector with a bivector (yielding a vector), and $\wedge$ denotes the exterior product of two vectors (yielding a bivector).
