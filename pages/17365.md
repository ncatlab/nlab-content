## Idea

The standard [[model category]] structure on the [[category]] of [[sequential spectra]] in ([[pointed topological space|pointed]]) [[topological spaces]] is a standard [[model structure on sequential spectra]]. An immediate variant works for [[sequential spectra]] in [[simplicial set]], see at _[[Bousfield-Friedlander model structure]]_.

As such, the model structure on topological sequential spectra [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presents]] the [[stable (infinity,1)-category of spectra]] of [[stable homotopy theory]], hence, in particular, its [[homotopy category]] is the classical [[stable homotopy category]].


## Background on sequential spectra

### Sequential pre-spectra

Write $S^1 \in Top^{\ast/}$ for the standard topological circle.  Write

$$
  \wedge 
  \;\colon\;
  Top^{\ast/}
  \times
  Top^{\ast/}
  \longrightarrow
  Top^{\ast/}
$$

for the [[smash product]] of [[pointed topological spaces]].


The following is the standard component-wise definition of sequential spectra. 

+-- {: .num_defn #SequentialSpectra}
###### Definition

A **[[sequential spectrum|sequential]] [[prespectrum]] in [[topological spaces]]**, or just **[[sequential spectrum]]** for short (or even just **[[spectrum]]), is

* an $\mathbb{N}$-[[graded object|graded]] [[pointed topological space]] $X_\bullet$ 

* equipped with morphisms $\sigma_n \colon S^1 \wedge X_n \to X_{n+1}$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

 A [[homomorphism]] $f \colon X \to Y$ of sequential spectra is a sequence $f_\bullet \colon X_\bullet \to Y_\bullet$ of homomorphisms of pointed simplicial sets, such that all [[diagrams]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    S^1 \wedge X_n &\stackrel{S^1 \wedge f_n}{\longrightarrow}& S^1 \wedge Y_n
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\sigma_n^X}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\sigma_n^Y}}
    \\
    X_{n+1} &\stackrel{f_{n+1}}{\longrightarrow}& Y_{n+1}
  }
$$

[[commuting diagram|commute]].

Write $SeqSpec(Top)$ for this [[category]] of topological sequential spectra.

###### Example

For $X \in SeqSpec(Top)$ and $K \in $ [[Top]], hence $K_+ \in Top^{\ast/}$ then $X \wedge K_+$ is the sequential spectrum degreewise given by the [[smash product]] of pointed objects

$$
  (X \wedge K_+)_n \coloneqq (X_n \wedge K_+)
$$

and with structure maps given by

$$
  S^1 \wedge (X_n \wedge K_+) \simeq (S^1 \wedge X_n) \wedge K_+ \stackrel{\sigma_n \wedge K_+}{\longrightarrow} X_{n+1}\wedge K_+

## The strict model structure on sequential spectra
 {#TheStrictModelStructure}

The [[model category]] structure on [[sequential spectra]] which [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presents]] [[stable homotopy theory]] is the "stable model structure" discussed [below](#TheStableModelStructure). Its fibrant objects are [[Omega-spectra]], hence are the proper [[spectrum objects]] among the pre-spectrum objects.

But for technical purposes it is useful to also be able to speak of a model structure on pre-spectra, which sees their homotopy theory as sequences of simplicial sets equipped with suspension maps, but not their stable structure. This is called the "strict model structure" for sequential spectra. Its main point is that the stable model structure of interest arises fromit via [[Bousfield localization of model categories|left Bousfield localization]].


+-- {: .num_defn #ClassesOfMorphismsOfTheStrictModelStructureOnSequentialSpectra}
###### Definition

Say that a homomorphism $f_\bullet \colon X_\bullet \to Y_\bullet$ in the category $SeqSpec(Top)$, def. \ref{SequentialSpectra} is

* a **strict weak equivalence** if each component $f_n \colon X_n \to Y_n$ is a weak equivalence in the [[classical model structure on topological spaces]] (hence a [[weak homotopy equivalence]]);

* a **strict fibration** if each component $f_n \colon X_n \to Y_n$ is a fibration in the [[classical model structure on topological spaces]] (hence a [[Serre fibration]]);

* a **strict cofibration** if the maps $f_0\colon X_0 \to Y_0$ as well as all [[pushout products]] of $f_n$ with the structure maps of $X$

=--


+-- {: .num_theorem #StrictModelStructureOnSequentialPrespectraIsModelCategory}
###### Theorem

The classes of morphisms in def. \ref{ClassesOfMorphismsOfTheStrictModelStructureOnSequentialSpectra} give the structure of a [[model category]] $SeqSpec(Top)_{strict}$, called the **strict model structure** on sequential spectra.

This is a [[cofibrantly generated model category]] with generating (acyclic) cofibrations the set $I_{SeqSpec}^{strict}$ (resp. $J_{SeqSpec}^{strict}$) from def. \ref{GeneratingAndGeneratingAcyclicCofibrationsForSeqSpecStrict}.

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Prop. \ref{SequentialSpectraAsDiagramSpectra} says that the category of sequential spectra is [[equivalence of categories|equivalently]] an  [[enriched functor category]]

$$
  SeqSpec(Top)
  \simeq
  [StdSpheres, Top_{cg}^{\ast}]
  \,.
$$

Accordingly, this carries the [[projective model structure on enriched functors]], and unwinding the definitions, this gives the statement for the fibrations and the weak equivalences.

It only remains to check that the cofibrations are as claimed. To that end, consider a [[commuting square]] of sequential spectra

$$
  \array{
    X_\bullet &\stackrel{h_\bullet}{\longrightarrow}& A_\bullet
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f_\bullet}} && \downarrow
    \\
    Y_\bullet &\longrightarrow& B_\bullet
  }
  \,.
$$

By definition, this is equivalently a $\mathbb{N}$-collection of commuting diagrams of simplicial sets of the form

$$
  \array{
    X_n &\stackrel{h_n}{\longrightarrow}& A_n
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f_n}} && \downarrow
    \\
    Y_n &\longrightarrow& B_n
  }
$$

such that all structure maps are respected.

$$
  \array{
    X_n &\stackrel{\sigma_n^X}{\longrightarrow}& X_{n+1}
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f_n}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f_{n+1}}}
    \\
    Y_n &\stackrel{\sigma_n^Y}{\longrightarrow}& Y_{n+1}
    \\
    & \searrow && \searrow
    \\
    && B_n &\stackrel{\sigma_n^B}{\longrightarrow}& B_{n+1}
  }
  \;\;\;
  \Rightarrow
  \;\;\;
  \array{
    X_n &\stackrel{\sigma_n^X}{\longrightarrow}& X_{n+1}
    \\
    & \searrow^{\mathrlap{h_n}} && \searrow^{\mathrlap{h_{n+1}}}
    \\
    && A_n &\stackrel{\sigma_n^A}{\longrightarrow}& A_{n+1}
    \\
    && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    && B_n &\stackrel{\sigma_n^B}{\longrightarrow}& B_{n+1}
  }
  \,.
$$

Hence a [[lifting]] in the original diagram is a lifting in each degree $n$, such that the lifting in degree $n+1$ makes these diagrams of structure maps commute.

Since components are parameterized over $\mathbb{N}$, this condition has solutions by [[induction]]. First of all there must be an ordinary lifting in degree 0. Then assume a lifting $l_n$ in degree $n$ has been found

$$
  \array{
    X_n &\stackrel{h_n}{\longrightarrow}& A_n
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f_n}} &\nearrow_{\mathrlap{l_n}}& \downarrow
    \\
    Y_n &\longrightarrow& B_n
  }
$$

the lifting $l_{n+1}$ in the next degree has to also make the following diagram commute

$$
  \array{
    X_n &\stackrel{\sigma_n^X}{\longrightarrow}& X_{n+1}
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f_n}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{h_{n+1}}}
    & \searrow 
    \\
    Y_n &\stackrel{\sigma_n^Y}{\longrightarrow}& Y_{n+1}
    && 
    \\
    & \searrow^{\mathrlap{l_n}} && \searrow^{\mathrlap{l_{n+1}}} & \downarrow
    \\
    && A_n &\stackrel{\sigma_n^A}{\longrightarrow}& A_{n+1}
  }
  \,.
$$

This is a [[cocone]] under the the commuting square for the structure maps, and therefore the outer diagram is equivalently a morphism out of the [[domain]] of the [[pushout product]] $f_n \Box \sigma_n^X$, while the compatible lift $l_{n+1}$ is equivalently a lift against this pushout product:

$$
  \array{
    Y_n \underset{X_n}{\sqcup} X_{n+1}
    &\stackrel{(\sigma_n^A l_n,h_{n+1})}{\longrightarrow}&
    A_{n+1}
    \\
    \downarrow &{}^{\mathllap{l_{n+1}}}\nearrow& \downarrow
    \\
    Y_{n+1} &\stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}& B_{n+1}
  }
  \,.

###### Theorem

The classes of morphisms in def. \ref{ClassesOfMorphismsOfTheStableModelStructureOnSequentialSpectra} give the structure of a [[model category]] $SeqSpec(Top)_{stable}$, called the **stable model structure** on sequential spectra.

Its fibrant objects are precisely the [[Omega-spectra]], def. \ref{OmegaSpectrum}.

Moreover, this is a [[cofibrantly generated model category]] with generating (acyclic) cofibrations the sets $I_{SeqSpec}^{stable}$ (and $J_{SeqSpec}^{stable}$) from def. \ref{GeneratingAndGeneratingAcyclicCofibrationsForSeqSpecStable}.

=--

This model structure is mentioned without proof in ([Bousfield-Friedlander 78](#BousfieldFriedlander78)). A full proof appears, generalized to a unified proof of model structures in [[highly structured spectra]] in ([Mandell-May-Schwede-Shipley 01](#MMSS00)), which we follow here. We spell out the proof [below](#ProofOfTheStableModelStructureOnSequentialSpectra)


### Proof of the stable model structure
 {#ProofOfTheStableModelStructureOnSequentialSpectra}

We state the proof of theorem \ref{StableModelStructureOnSequentialSpectraIsModelCategory} [below](#StableModelStructureOnDiagramSpectraProof) after a few lemmas.


+-- {: .num_lemma #CorepresentationOfAdjunctStructureMaps}
###### Lemma

The morphisms of [[free spectra]] $\{k_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ from def. \ref{FreeSequentialSpectra} co-represent the adjunct structure maps of sequential spectra:

for $X \in SeqSpec(Top)$, then 

$$
  \array{
    [F_n S^0, X] &\simeq& X_n
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{[k_n,X]}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\tilde \sigma_n^X}}
    \\
    [F_{n+1}S^1, X] &\simeq& \Omega X_{n+1}
  }
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Recall that we are precomposing with

$$
  \array{
    & \vdots && \vdots
    \\
    (k_n)_{n+3} & S^3 &\stackrel{id}{\longrightarrow}& S^3
    \\
    (k_n)_{n+2} & S^2 &\stackrel{id}{\longrightarrow}& S^2
    \\
    (k_n)_{n+1} & S^1 &\stackrel{id}{\longrightarrow}& S^1
    \\
    (k_n)_n \colon & \ast &\stackrel{0}{\longrightarrow}& S^0
    \\
    & \ast &\longrightarrow& \ast
    \\
    & \vdots && \vdots
    \\
    & \ast &\longrightarrow& \ast
    \\
    & \underbrace{\,\,\,} && \underbrace{\,\,\,}
    \\
    k_n \colon & F_{n+1} S^1 &\stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}& F_n S^0
  }
$$


Now for $X$ any sequential spectrum, then a morphism $f \colon F_n S^0 \to X$ is uniquely determined by its $n$th component $f_n \colon S^0 \to X_n$: the compatibility with the structure maps forces the next component, in particular, to be $\sigma_n^X\circ \Sigma f$:

$$
  \array{
    \Sigma S^0 &\stackrel{\Sigma f}{\longrightarrow}& \Sigma X_n
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\sigma_n^X}}
    \\
    S^1 &\stackrel{\sigma_n^X \circ \Sigma f}{\longrightarrow}& X_n
  }
  \,.
$$

But that $(n+1)$st component is just the component that similarly determines the precompositon of $f$ with $k_n$, hence $f\circ k_n$ is uniquely determined by the map $\sigma_n^X \circ \Sigma f$. Therefore $[k_n,-]$ is the function

$$
  [k_n,-]
   \;\colon\;
  X_n 
  = 
  [S^0, X_n]
    \stackrel{f \mapsto \sigma_n^X \circ \Sigma f}{\longrightarrow}
  \Maps(S^1, X_{n+1})
  =
  \Omega X_{n+1}
  \,.
$$

It remains to see that this is indeed the $(\Sigma \dashv \Omega)$-[[adjunct]] of $\sigma_n^X$. By the general formula for adjuncts, this is

$$
  \tilde \sigma_n^X 
    \;\colon\; 
  X_n 
     \stackrel{\eta}{\longrightarrow} 
  \Omega \Sigma X_n
     \stackrel{\Omega \sigma_n^X}{\longrightarrow}
  \Omega X_{n+1}
  \,.
$$

To compare to the above, we check what this does on points: $S^0 \stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow} X_n$ is sent to the composite

$$
   S^0 
     \stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}
   X_n 
     \stackrel{\eta}{\longrightarrow}

###### Lemma

1. Every weak equivalence with respect to the strict model structure is a stable weak equivalence.

1. Every stable weak equivalence between [[Omega-spectra]] is a weak equivalence in the strict model structure.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The first statement follows directly from  the definition of stable weak equivalences, since weak equivalences become isomorphisms in the [[homotopy category of a model category|homotopy category]].

For the second statement, let $f \colon X \to Y$ be a stable weak equivalence between [[Omega-spectra]]. Then by definition, in particular

$$
  [f,X]_{strict} \;\colon\; [Y,X]_{strict} \longrightarrow [X,X]_{strict}
$$

is a [[bijection]]. Therefore the pre-image of $[id_X] \in [X,X]_{strict}$ is an inverse to $f$ in the [[homotopy category]] of the strict model structure. Hence $f$ represents an isomorphism in the strict homotopy category and is hence a weak equivalence in the strict model structure.

###### Lemma

Every element in $J_{SeqSpec}^{stable}$ (def. \ref{GeneratingAndGeneratingAcyclicCofibrationsForSeqSpecStable}) is both:

1. a cofibration with respect to the strict model structure of theorem \ref{StrictModelStructureOnSequentialPrespectraIsModelCategory};

1. a stable equivalence (def. \ref{ClassesOfMorphismsOfTheStableModelStructureOnSequentialSpectra}).

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof 

For the elements in $J_{SeqSpec}^{strict}$ this is part of theorem \ref{StrictModelStructureOnSequentialPrespectraIsModelCategory}.
To see that the $k_n \Box i_+$ are strict cofibrations: By [[Joyal-Tierney calculus]] $k_n \Box i_+$ has left lifting against any acyclic strict fibration $f$ precisely if $k_n$ has left lifting against $f^{i_+}$. By $SeqSpec(Top)_{strict}$ behaving like a $Top_{Quillen}$-[[enriched model category]] (with relative CW-complexes in one argument) the latter is still a strict acyclic fibration. Since $k_n$ is evidently a strict cofibration, the lifting follows and hence also $k_n \Box i_+$ is a strict cofibration.


To see that they are stable equivalences: The morphisms $k_n$ by construction, by [[two-out-of-three]] and by lemma \ref{CorepresentationOfAdjunctStructureMaps} are stable equivalences. Hence the [[derived hom-space]] out of $k_n \Box i_+$ is the homotopy pullback of a weak equivalence, hence is a weak equivalence, hence on the homotopy category an iso.

A morphism $f \colon X \to Y$ in $SeqSpec(Top)$ is a $J_{SeqSpec}^{stable}$-[[injective morphism]] precisely if 

1. it is fibration in the strict model structure (hence degreewise a fibration)

1. for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the [[commuting squares]] of structure map compatibility on the underlying [[sequential spectra]]

In particular, the $J_{SeqSpec}^{stable}$-[[injective objects]] are precisely the [[Omega-spectra]], def. \ref{OmegaSpectrum}.


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By theorem \ref{StrictModelStructureOnSequentialPrespectraIsModelCategory}, lifting against $J_{SeqSpec}^{stric}$ alone characterizes strict fibrations, hence degreewise fibrations. Lifting against the remaining [[pushout product]] morphism $k_n \Box i_+$ is, by [[Joyal-Tierney calculus]], equivalent to left lifting $i_+$ against the dual pullback product of $f^{k_n}$, which means that $f^{k_n}$ is a weak homotopy equivalence. But by lemma \ref{CorepresentationOfAdjunctStructureMaps}, $f^{k_n}$ is the comparison morphism into the homotopy pullback under consideration.

###### Lemma

A morphism in $SeqSpec(Top)$ which is both 

1. a stable weeak equivalence;

1. a $J_{SeqSpec}^{stable}$-[[injective morphism]] 

is an acyclic fibration in the strict model structure, hence is degreewise a [[weak homotopy equivalence]] and [[Serre fibration]] of topological spaces;

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let $f\colon E \to B$ be both a stable equivalence as well as a $J_{SeqSpec}^{stable}$-injective morphism. Since $J_{SeqSpec}^{stable}$ contains the generating acyclic cofibrations for the strict model structure, $f$ is in particular a strict fibration, hence a degreewise fibration. Therefore the [[fiber]] $F$ of $f$ is its [[homotopy fiber]] in the strict model structure. This implies that for any $E$ that with $[f,E]_{strict}$ a bijection, by assumption also $[\ast,E]_{strict} \to [F,E]_{strict}$ is a bijection, hence that $F\to \ast$ is also a stable weak equivalence. 

Observe also that $F$, being the pullback of a $J_{SeqSpec}^{stable}$-injective morphisms (by the standard [closure properties](injective+or+projective+morphism#ClosureProperties)) is a $J_{SeqSpec}^{stable}$-[[injective object]], so that by lemma \ref{KInjectivesAreAcyclicCofibrations} $F$ is an [[Omega-spectrum]]. Together this implies with lemma \ref{StableEquivalencesBetweenOmegaSpectraAreStrictWeakEquivalences} that $F \to \ast$ is a weak equivalence in the strict model structure, hence degreewise a [[weak homotopy equivalence]]. From this the [[long exact sequence of homotopy groups]] implies that $\pi_{\bullet \geq 1}(f_n)$ is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]] for all $n$ and for each homotopy group in positive degree. 

To infer from this the remaining case that also $\pi_0(f_0)$ is an isomorphism, observe that, by assumption of $J_{SeqSpec}^{stable}$-injectivity, lemma \ref{KInjectivesAreAcyclicCofibrations} gives that $f_n$ is a homotopy pullback (in pointed topological spaces) of $\Omega (f_{n+1})$. But, by the above, $\Omega (f_{n+1})$ is a weak homotopy equivalence, since $\pi_\bullet(\Omega(-)) = \pi_{\bullet+1}(-)$. Therefore $f_n$ is the homotopy pullback of a weak homotopy equivalence and hence itself a weak homotopy equivalence.

###### Lemma

The [[retracts]] of $J_{SeqSpec}^{stable}$-[[relative cell complexes]] are precisely the morphisms which are

1. stable equivalences, 

1. as well as strict cofibrations.

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Since all elements of $J_{SeqSpec}^{stable}$ are stable equivalences and strict cofibrations by lemma \ref{ElementsOfKAreStableEquivalencesAndStrictCofibrations}, it follows that every retract of relative $J_{SeqSpec}^{stable}$-cell complex has the same property.

In the other direction, if $f$ is a stable equivalence and strict cofibration, by the [[small object argument]] it factors $f \colon \stackrel{i}{\to}\stackrel{p}{\to}$ as a relative $J_{SeqSpec}^{stable}$-cell complex $i$ followed by a $J_{SeqSpec}^{stable}$-[[injective morphism]] $p$. By the previous statement $i$ is a stable equivalence, and so by assumption and by [[two-out-of-three]] so is $p$. Therefore lemma \ref{KInjectiveStableEquivalencesAreStrictEquivalences} implies that $p$ is a strict acyclic fibration. But then the assumption that $f$ is a strict cofibration mean that it has the [[left lifting property]] against $p$, and so the [[retract argument]] implies that $f$ is a retract of the relative $K$-cell complex $i$.

A morphism in $SeqSpec(Top)$ is both

1. a stable weak equivalence 

1. [[injective morphism|injective]] with respect to the cofibrations of the strict model structure that are also stable equivalences;

###### Proof

Every acyclic fibration in the strict model structure in injective with respect to strict cofibrations by the strict model structure; and it is a stable equivalence by item 1 of lemma \ref{StableEquivalencesBetweenOmegaSpectraAreStrictWeakEquivalences}.

Conversely, a morphism injective with respect to strict cofibrations that are stable equivalences is a $K$-[[injective morphism]] by corollary \ref{KInjectivesAreIndeedTheStableFibrations}, and hence if it is also a stable equivalence then by lemma \ref{KInjectiveStableEquivalencesAreStrictEquivalences} it is a strict acylic fibration.

+-- {: .proof #StableModelStructureOnDiagramSpectraProof}
###### Proof
(of theorem \ref{StableModelStructureOnSequentialSpectraIsModelCategory})

The non-trivial points to check are the two [[weak factorization systems]].

That $(Cof_{stable}\cap W_{stable} \;,\; Fib_{stable})$ is a weak factorization system follows from lemma \ref{RetractsOfRelativeKCellComplexesAreTheStableEquivalencesAndStrictCofibrations} and the [[small object argument]]. 

By lemma \ref{StableAcyclicFibrationsAreEquivalentlyStrictAcyclicFibrations} the stable acyclic fibrations are equivalently the strict acyclic fibrations and hence the weak factorization system $(Cof_{stable} \;,\; Fib_{stable} \cap W_{stable})$ is identified with that of the strict model structure $(Cof_{strict} \;,\; Fib_{strict} \cap W_{strict})$.

+-- {: .num_prop #CellSpectraAreCofibrantInModelStructureOnTopologicalSequentialSpectra}
###### Proposition

A [[sequential spectrum]] $X\in SeqSpec(Top)_{stable}$ is cofibrant in particular if all component spaces are [[cell complexes]] and all its structure morphisms $S^1 \wedge X_n \to X_{n+1}$ are [[relative cell complexes]]. In particular [[CW-spectra]] are cofibrant in $SeqSpec(Top)_{stable}$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

A morphism $\ast \to X$ is a cofibration according to def. \ref{ClassesOfMorphismsOfTheStrictModelStructureOnSequentialSpectra} (in either the strict or stable model structure, they have the same cofibrations) if 

1. $X_0$ is cofibrant, hence a retract of a [[cell complex]];

1. $$
     \ast_{n+1}\underset{S^1 \wedge \ast_n}{\coprod} S^1 \wedge X_n
     \longrightarrow
     X_{n+1}
   $$

   is a cofibration. But in this case the [[pushout]] reduces to just its second summand, and so this is now equivalent to

   $$
     S^1 \wedge X_n \longrightarrow X_{n+1}
   $$

   being cofibrations; hence [[retracts]] of [[relative cell complexes]].

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #CylinderSpectrumOverCWSpectrumIsGood}
###### Proposition

For $X\in SeqSpec(Top)_{stable}$ a [[CW-spectrum]], then its standard [[cylinder spectrum]] $X \wedge (I_+)$ is a _good_ [[cylinder object]] in that the inclusion

$$
  X \vee X \longrightarrow X \wedge (I_+)
$$

is a cofibration in $SeqSpec(Top)_{stable}$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

According to def. \ref{ClassesOfMorphismsOfTheStrictModelStructureOnSequentialSpectra} we need to check that for all $n$ the morphism

$$
  (X \vee X)_{n+1}
  \underset{S^1 \wedge (X\vee X)_n}{\sqcup}
  S^1 \wedge (X \wedge (I_+))_n
  \longrightarrow
  (X \wedge (I_+))_{n+1}
$$

is a retract of a relative cell complex. After distributing indices and smash products over wedge sums, this is equivalently

$$
  (X_{n+1} \vee X_{n+1})
  \underset{(S^1 \wedge X_n )\vee (S^1 \wedge X_n))}{\sqcup}
   S^1 \wedge X_n \wedge (I_+)
  \longrightarrow
  X_{n+1} \wedge I_+
  \,.
$$

Now by the assumption that $X$ is a [[CW-spectrum]], each $X_{n}$ is a CW-complex, and this implies that $X_n \wedge (I_+)$ is a relative cell complex in $Top^{\ast/}$. With this, inspection shows that also the above morphism is a relative cell complex.
