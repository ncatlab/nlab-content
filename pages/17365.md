## Idea

The standard [[model category]] structure on the [[category]] of [[sequential spectra]] in ([[pointed topological space|pointed]]) [[topological spaces]] is a standard [[model structure on sequential spectra]]. An immediate variant works for [[sequential spectra]] in [[simplicial set]], see at _[[Bousfield-Friedlander model structure]]_.

As such, the model structure on topological sequential spectra [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presents]] the [[stable (infinity,1)-category of spectra]] of [[stable homotopy theory]], hence, in particular, its [[homotopy category]] is the classical [[stable homotopy category]].

## Sequential spectra

For ease of reference, we collect some basic definitions from _[[sequential spectra]]_.

The following def. \ref{SequentialSpectra} is the traditional component-wise definition of [[sequential spectra]], was first stated in ([Lima 58](spectrum#Lima58)) and became widely appreciated with ([Boardman 65](spectrum#Boardman65)).  

> It is generally supposed that [[George Whitehead|G. W. Whitehead]] also had something to do with it, but the latter takes a modest attitude about that. ([Adams 74, p. 131](#Adams74))

Below in prop. \ref{SequentialSpectraAsDiagramSpectra} we discuss an equivalent definition of sequrntial spectra as "topological diagram spectra" ([Mandell-May-Schwede-Shipley 00](#MMSS00)), namely as [[topologically enriched functors]] ([defn.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#TopologicallyEnrichedFunctor)) on [[n-spheres]], which is useful for establishing the [[stable model category]] structure ([below](#StableModelStructureOnSequentialSpectra)) and for establishing the [[symmetric monoidal smash product of spectra]] (in [1.2](#DiagramSpectra)).

Throughout we say "[[topological space]]" for [[compactly generated topological space]] ([defn.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#kTop))

+-- {: .num_defn #SequentialSpectra}
###### Definition

A **[[sequential spectrum|sequential]] [[prespectrum]] in [[topological spaces]]**, or just **[[sequential spectrum]]** for short (or even just **[[spectrum]]), is

1. an $\mathbb{N}$-[[graded object|graded]] [[pointed topological space|pointed]] [[compactly generated topological space]]  $X_\bullet = (X_n \in Top_{cg}^{\ast/})_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ (the **component spaces**); 

1. pointed [[continuous functions]] $\sigma_n \colon S^1 \wedge X_n \to X_{n+1}$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ (the **structure maps**) from the [[smash product]] ([defn.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#SmashProductOfPointedObjects))  of one component space with the standard [[1-sphere]] to the next component space.

 A [[homomorphism]] $f \colon X \to Y$ of sequential spectra is a sequence $f_\bullet \colon X_\bullet \to Y_\bullet$ of base point-preserving continuous function, such that all [[diagrams]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    S^1 \wedge X_n &\stackrel{S^1 \wedge f_n}{\longrightarrow}& S^1 \wedge Y_n
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\sigma_n^X}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\sigma_n^Y}}
    \\
    X_{n+1} &\stackrel{f_{n+1}}{\longrightarrow}& Y_{n+1}
  }
$$

For $X\in Top^{\ast/_{cg}}$ a [[pointed topological space]], its **[[suspension spectrum]]** $\Sigma^\infty X$ is the [[sequential spectrum]] , def. \ref{SequentialSpectra} with

* $(\Sigma^\infty X)_n \coloneqq S^n \wedge X$;

* $\sigma_n \colon S^1 \wedge S^n \wedge X \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} S^{n+1}X$ the canonical [[homeomorphism]].

###### Definition

Let $X\in SeqSpec(Top_{cg})$ be a [[sequential spectrum]] (def. \ref{SequentialSpectra}) and $K \in Top^{\ast/}_{cg}$ a [[pointed topological space|pointed]] [[compactly generated topological space]]. Then

1. $X \wedge K$ (the **[[smash product|smash]] [[tensoring]]** of $X$ with $K$) is the sequential spectrum with 

   * $(X \wedge K)_n \coloneqq X_n \wedge K$ ([[smash product]] on component spaces ([defn.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#SmashProductOfPointedObjects)))

   * $\sigma_n^{X \wedge K} \coloneqq \sigma_n^{X} \wedge id_{K}$.

1. $Maps(K,X)_\ast$ (the **[[powering]]** of $K$ into $X$) is the sequential spectrum with

   * $(Maps(K,X)_\ast)_n \coloneqq Maps(K,X_n)_\ast$ (compactly generated [[pointed mapping space]] ([def.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#CompactlyGeneratedMappingSpaces), [def.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#PointedMappingSpace)))

   * $\sigma_n^{Maps(K,X)_\ast} \colon S^1 \wedge Maps(K,X_n) \to Maps(K,S^1 \wedge X_n)_\ast \overset{Maps(K,\sigma_n)_\ast}{\longrightarrow} Maps(K,X_{n+1})_\ast$.

+-- {: .num_prop #AdjunctionBetweenSmashTensoringAndPowering}
###### Proposition

For any $K \in Top^{\ast/}_{cg}$ the functors of smash tensoring and powering with $K$, from def. \ref{TensoringAndPoweringOfSequentialSpectra}, constitute a pair of [[adjoint functors]]

$$
  SeqSpec(Top_{cg})
    \underoverset
    {
      \underset{Maps(K,-)_\ast}{\longrightarrow}
    }
    {
      \overset{(-) \wedge K}{\longleftarrow}
    }
    {\bot}
  SeqSpec(Top_{cg})
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

For $X, Y\in SeqSpec(Top_{cg})$ and $K \in Top_{cg}^{\ast/}$, let

$$
  X \wedge K \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} Y
$$

be a morphism, with component maps fitting into commuting squares of the form

$$
  \array{
    S^1 \wedge X_n \wedge K 
      &\overset{S^1 \wedge f_n}{\longrightarrow}&
    S^1 \wedge Y_n
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\sigma^X_n \wedge K}}\downarrow 
      && 
    \downarrow^{\sigma^Y_n}
    \\
    X_{n+1} \wedge K
     &\overset{f_{n+1}}{\longrightarrow}&
   Y_{n+1}
  }
  \,.
$$

The adjunction

$$
  Top_{cg}^{\ast/}
    \underoverset
     {\underset{Maps(K,-)_\ast}{\longrightarrow}}
     {\overset{(-) \wedge K}{\longleftarrow}}
     {\bot}
  Top_{cg}^{\ast/}
$$

(from [this prop.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#PointedCompactlyGeneratedTopologicalSpacesIsSymmetricMonoidalClosed)) gives that these squares are in natural bijection with squares of the form

$$
  \array{
    S^1 \wedge X_n
      &\overset{\widetilde{S^1 \wedge f_n}}{\longrightarrow}&
    Maps(K,S^1 \wedge Y_n)_\ast
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\sigma_n^X}}\downarrow 
      && 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{Maps(K,\sigma_n^Y)_\ast}}
    \\
    X_{n+1} 
      &\overset{\tilde f_{n+1}}{\longrightarrow}&
    Maps(K, Y_{n+1})_\ast
  }
  \,.
$$

But since the map $S^1 \wedge f_n$ is the smash product of two maps, only one of which involves the smash factor of $K$, one sees that here the top map factors through the inclusion of the space of those functions $K \to S^1 \wedge Y^n$ whose first component is constant on the basepoint, hence through 

$$
  S^1 \wedge Maps(K,Y_n)_\ast 
    \longrightarrow 
  Maps(K, S^1 \wedge Y_n)_\ast
$$

$$
  [s,\phi] \mapsto [const_s,\phi]
  \,.
$$

Hence the commuting square above factors as

$$
  \array{
    S^1 \wedge X_n
      &\overset{S^1 \wedge \tilde f_n}{\longrightarrow}&
    S^1 \wedge Maps(K, Y_n)_\ast
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\sigma_n^X}}\downarrow 
      && 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\sigma_n^{Maps(K,Y)_\ast}}}
    \\
    X_{n+1}
      &\overset{\tilde f_{n+1}}{\longrightarrow}&
    Maps(K, Y_{n+1})_\ast
  }
  \,.
$$

This gives the structure maps for a homomorphism

$$
  \tilde f 
    \;\colon\;
  X \longrightarrow Maps(K,Y)_\ast
  \,.
$$

Running this argument backwards shows that the map $f \mapsto \tilde f$ given thereby is a bijection.

###### Remark

For the [[adjunction]] of prop. \ref{AdjunctionBetweenSmashTensoringAndPowering} it is crucial that the smash tensoring in def. \ref{TensoringAndPoweringOfSequentialSpectra} is from the _right_, at least as long as the structure maps in def. \ref{SequentialSpectra} are defined as they are, with the circle smash factor on the left. We could change both at once: take the structure maps to be from smash products with the circle on the right, and take smash tensoring to be from the left. But having both on the right or both on the left does not work.

###### Example

For $X \in SeqSpec(Top_{cg})$ a [[sequential spectrum]], def. \ref{SequentialSpectra}, its **standard [[cylinder spectrum]]** is its [[smash product|smash]] [[tensoring]] $X \wedge (I_+)$, def. \ref{TensoringAndPoweringOfSequentialSpectra}, with the standard interval ([def.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#TopologicalInterval)) with a basepoint freely adjoined ([def.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#BasePointAdjoined)). The component spaces of the [[cylinder spectrum]] are the standard [[reduced cylinders]] ([def.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#StandardReducedCyclinderInTop)) of the component spaces of $X$:

###### Proposition

The functor $\Sigma^\infty$ that forms [[suspension spectra]] (def. \ref{SuspensionSpectrum}) has a [[right adjoint]] functor $\Omega^\infty$

$$
  (\Sigma^\infty \dashv \Omega^\infty)
  \;\colon\;

given by picking the 0-comonent space:

$$
  \Omega^\infty(X) = X_0

$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By def. \ref{SequentialSpectra} the components $f_n$ of a homomorphism of [[sequential spectra]] of the form 

$$
  \Sigma^\infty X \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} Y
$$ 

have to make these diagrams commute

$$
  \array{
    S^1 \wedge S^n X &\overset{S^1 \wedge f_n}{\longrightarrow}& S^1 \wedge Y_{n}

    {}^{\mathllap{\simeq}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\sigma^Y_n}}
    \\
    S^{n+1} \wedge X
    &\overset{f_{n+1}}{\longrightarrow}& Y_{n+1}
  }
$$

for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Since here the left vertical map is an isomorphism by def. \ref{SuspensionSpectrum}, this uniquely fixes $f_{n+1}$ in terms of $f_n$. Hence the only freedom in specifying $f$ is in the choice of the component $f_0 \colon X \longrightarrow Y_0$, which is equivalently a morphism

$$
  X \overset{\tilde f}{\longrightarrow} \Omega^\infty Y

##### Suspension and looping

We discuss models for the operation of [[reduced suspension]] and forming [[loop space objects]] of sequential spectra.

+-- {: .num_defn #SequentialSpectrumRealSuspension}
###### Definition

For $X$ a sequential spectrum, then

1. the **standard suspension** of $X$ is $X \wedge S^1$ according to def. \ref{TensoringAndPoweringOfSequentialSpectra};

1. the **standard looping** of $X$ is $Maps(S^1,X)_\ast$ according to def. \ref{TensoringAndPoweringOfSequentialSpectra}.

The standard suspension is equivalently the [[cofiber]] of the canonical inclusion of boundaries into the standard [[cylinder spectrum]]  $X \wedge (I_+)$ of example \ref{StandardCylinderSpectrumSequential}:

$$
  X \wedge S^1 
    \simeq
  cofib\left(
    X \vee X \to X \wedge (I_+)
  \right)
  \,.
$$

The standard looping is equivalently the [[fiber]] of the canonical projection from the standard path space spectrum $Maps(I_+,X)_\ast$ (exmple \ref{StandardPathSpaceSpectrumSequential}):

$$
  Maps(S^1,X)_\ast 
   \simeq
  fib\left(
    Maps(I_+,X)_\ast \to X \times X
  \right)
  \,.
$$


=--

There are two other models for suspension and looping of spectra, which will turn out to be isomorphic in the [[stable homotopy category]]:

+-- {: .num_defn #ShiftedSpectrum}
###### Definition

For $X$ a [[sequential spectrum]] (def. \ref{SequentialSpectra}) and $k \in \mathbb{Z}$, the $k$-fold **shifted spectrum** of $X$ is the sequential spectrum denoted $X[k]$ given by

* $(X[k])_n \coloneqq \left\{ \array{X_{n+k} & for \; n+k \geq 0 \\ \ast & otherwise } \right. $;

* $\sigma_n^{X[k]} \coloneqq \left\{ \array{ \sigma^X_{n+k} & for \; n+k \geq 0 \\ 0 & otherwise} \right. $.

=--


+-- {: .num_defn #SequentialSpectrumFakeSuspension}
###### Definition

For $X$ a [[sequential spectrum]], def. \ref{SequentialSpectra}, then

1. the **alternative suspension** of $X$ is the sequential spectrum $\Sigma X$ with

   1. $(\Sigma X)_n \coloneqq S^1 \wedge X_n$

   1. $\sigma_n^{\Sigma X} \coloneqq S^1 \wedge (\sigma^X_n)$.

1. the **alternative looping** of $X$ is the sequential spectrum $\Omega X$ with

   1. $(\Omega X)_n \coloneqq Maps(S^1,X_n)_\ast$;

   1. $\tilde \sigma_n^{\Omega X} \coloneqq Maps(S^1,\tilde \sigma^X_n)_\ast$.  

Here $\tilde \sigma_n$ denotes the [[adjunct]] of $\sigma_n$.

=--

In some references this "alternative suspension" is called the "fake suspension" e.g. ([Jardine 15, section 10.4](sequential+spectrum#Jardine15)).

+-- {: .num_remark #StandardAndAlternativeSuspensionAreNotDirectlyComparable}
###### Remark

There is no direct comparison morphism between the standard suspension (def. \ref{SequentialSpectrumRealSuspension}) and the alternative suspension (def. \ref{SequentialSpectrumFakeSuspension}). This is due to the non-trivial graded commutativity of smash products of spheres (prop. \ref{GradedCommutativityOfSmashOfSpheres}): 

namely a comparison morphism $\Sigma X \longrightarrow X \wedge S^1$ (or alternatively the other way round) would have to make the following diagrams commute:

$$
  \array{
     S^1 \wedge S^1 \wedge X_n &\longrightarrow& S^1 \wedge X_n \wedge S^1
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{S^1 \wedge \sigma_n}}\downarrow 
       &(nc)& 
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\sigma_n \wedge S^1}}
     \\
     S^1 \wedge X_{n-1} &\longrightarrow& X_{n-1} \wedge S^1
  }
$$

Clearly the only way to go about achieving this is to have the horizontal morphisms be the [[braiding]] homomorphisms of the [[smash product]]. To see this more clearly, consider labeling the two copies of the circle appearing here as $S^1_a$ and $S^1_b$. Then the diagram we are dealing with looks like this:

$$
  \array{
     S_a^1 \wedge S_b^1 \wedge X_n &\longrightarrow& S_b^1 \wedge X_n \wedge S_a^1
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{S^1_a \wedge \sigma_n}}\downarrow 
       &(nc)& 
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\sigma_n \wedge S^1_a}}
     \\
     S_a^1 \wedge X_{n-1} &\longrightarrow& X_{n-1} \wedge S_a^1
  }
$$

This makes it manifest that as $S^1_a$ passes along the top and right, it has to be braided past $S^1_b$, while this does not occur as $S^1_a$ passes down and left. Since the braiding $S^1_a \wedge S^1_b \to S^1_b \wedge S^1_a$ is nontrivial (the homotopy class of this map differs from the identity by a minus sign in $\pi_2(S^2) = \mathbb{Z}$), there is no way to make this diagram commute.

###### Remark

The looping and suspension operations in def. \ref{SequentialSpectrumRealSuspension} and def. \ref{SequentialSpectrumFakeSuspension} commute with shifting, def. \ref{ShiftedSpectrum}. Therefore in expressions like $\Sigma (X[1])$ etc. we may omit the parenthesis.

###### Proposition

The constructions from def. \ref{SequentialSpectrumRealSuspension}, def. \ref{ShiftedSpectrum} and def. \ref{SequentialSpectrumFakeSuspension} form pairs of [[adjoint functors]] $SeqSpec \to SeqSpec$ like so:

1. $(-)[1] \;\dashv\; (-)[-1] \;\dashv\; (-)[1] \;\dashv\; \cdots $;

1. $(-)\wedge S^1 \dashv Maps(S^1,-)_\ast$;

1. $\Sigma \dashv \Omega$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The first is immediate from the definition. 

The second is just degreewise the adjunction [[smash product]]$\dashv$[[pointed mapping space]] (discussed [here](pointed+object#ClosedMonoidalStructure)), since by definition the smash product and mapping spaces here do not interact non-trivially with the structure maps.

The third follows by applying the [[smash product]]$\dashv$[[pointed mapping space]]-adjunction isomorphism twice, like so:

Morphisms $f\colon \Sigma X \to Y$ are in components given by commuting diagrams of this form:

$$
  \array{  
    S^1 \wedge S^1 \wedge X_{n} 
      &\overset{S^1 \wedge f_{n}}{\longrightarrow}&
    S^1 \wedge Y_{n}
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{S^1 \wedge \sigma_n^X}}\downarrow 
     && 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\sigma^Y_n}}
    \\
    S^1 \wedge X_{n+1} &\underset{f_{n+1}}{\longrightarrow}& Y_{n+1}
  }
  \,.
$$

Applying the adjunction isomorphism diagonally gives a bijection to diagrams of this form:

$$
  \array{
   S^1 \wedge X_n &\overset{f_n}{\longrightarrow}& Y_n
   \\
   {}^{\mathllap{\sigma^X_n}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\tilde \sigma^Y_n}}
   \\
   X_{n+1} &\underset{\widetilde{f_{n+1}}}{\longrightarrow}& Maps(S^1,Y_{n+1})_\ast
  }
  \,.
$$

Then applying the same isomorphism diagonally once more gives a further bijection to  commuting diagrams of this form:

$$
  \array{
    X_n &\overset{\widetilde{f_n}}{\longrightarrow}& Maps(S^1,Y_n)_\ast
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\tilde \sigma_n}}\downarrow 
      && 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{Maps(S^1,\tilde \sigma^Y_n)_\ast}}
    \\
    Maps(S^1, X_{n+1})_\ast
      &\underset{Maps(S^1,\widetilde{f_{n+1}})_\ast}{\longrightarrow}&
    Maps\left(S^1, Maps(S^1,Y_{n+1})_\ast\right)_\ast
  }
  \,.
$$

This, finally, equivalently exhibits morphisms of the form

$$
  X \longrightarrow \Omega Y
  \,.
$$

It is sufficient to check 

$$
  \Sigma^\infty \circ \Sigma \simeq \Sigma \circ \Sigma^\infty 
  \,.
$$

From this the statement

$$
  \Omega^\infty \circ \Omega \simeq \Omega \circ \Omega^\infty
$$

follows by uniqueness of adjoints.

So let $X \in Top_{cg}^{\ast/}$. Then 

* $(\Sigma \Sigma^\infty X)_n = S^1 \wedge S^n \wedge X$,

* $\sigma^{(\Sigma \Sigma^\infty X)}_n \colon S^1 \wedge S^1 \wedge S^n \wedge X \overset{S^1 \wedge id}{\longrightarrow} S^1 \wedge S^{1+n} \wedge X$,

while

* $(\Sigma^\infty \Sigma X)_n = S^n \wedge S^1 \wedge X$,


* $\sigma_n^{(\Sigma^\infty \Sigma X)}\colon S^1\wedge S^n \wedge S^1 \wedge X \overset{id \wedge S^1 \wedge X}{\longrightarrow} S^{1+n} \wedge S^1 \wedge X$,

where we write "id" for the canonical isomorphism. Clearly there is a natural isomorphism given by the canonical identifications

$$
  S^1 \wedge S^n \wedge X
    \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  (S^1)^{\wedge^{n+1}}\wedge X
     \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  S^n \wedge S^1 \wedge X
  \,.
$$

(As long as we are not smash-permuting the $S^1$ with the $S^n$ -- and here we don't -- then the fact that they get mixed under this isomorphism is irrelevant. The point where this does become relevant is the content of remark \ref{StandardAndAlternativeSuspensionAreNotDirectlyComparable} below.)

## The strict model structure on sequential spectra
 {#TheStrictModelStructure}

The [[model category]] structure on [[sequential spectra]] which [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presents]] [[stable homotopy theory]] is the "stable model structure" discussed [below](#TheStableModelStructure). Its fibrant objects are [[Omega-spectra]], hence are the proper [[spectrum objects]] among the pre-spectrum objects.

But for technical purposes it is useful to also be able to speak of a model structure on pre-spectra, which sees their homotopy theory as sequences of simplicial sets equipped with suspension maps, but not their stable structure. This is called the "strict model structure" for sequential spectra. Its main point is that the stable model structure of interest arises fromit via [[Bousfield localization of model categories|left Bousfield localization]].

###### Theorem

The classes of morphisms in def. \ref{ClassesOfMorphismsOfTheStrictModelStructureOnSequentialSpectra} give the structure of a [[model category]] $SeqSpec(Top)_{strict}$, called the **strict model structure** or **level model structure** on sequential spectra.

This is a [[cofibrantly generated model category]] with generating (acyclic) cofibrations the set $I_{SeqSpec}^{strict}$ (resp. $J_{SeqSpec}^{strict}$) from def. \ref{GeneratingAndGeneratingAcyclicCofibrationsForSeqSpecStrict}.

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Prop. \ref{SequentialSpectraAsDiagramSpectra} says that the category of sequential spectra is [[equivalence of categories|equivalently]] an  [[enriched functor category]]

$$
  SeqSpec(Top)
  \simeq
  [StdSpheres, Top_{cg}^{\ast}]
  \,.
$$

Accordingly, this carries the [[projective model structure on enriched functors]], and unwinding the definitions, this gives the statement for the fibrations and the weak equivalences.

It only remains to check that the cofibrations are as claimed. To that end, consider a [[commuting square]] of sequential spectra

$$
  \array{
    X_\bullet &\stackrel{h_\bullet}{\longrightarrow}& A_\bullet
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f_\bullet}} && \downarrow
    \\
    Y_\bullet &\longrightarrow& B_\bullet
  }
  \,.
$$

By definition, this is equivalently a $\mathbb{N}$-collection of commuting diagrams of simplicial sets of the form

$$
  \array{
    X_n &\stackrel{h_n}{\longrightarrow}& A_n
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f_n}} && \downarrow
    \\
    Y_n &\longrightarrow& B_n
  }
$$

such that all structure maps are respected.

$$
  \array{
    S^1 \wedge X_n &\stackrel{\sigma_n^X}{\longrightarrow}& X_{n+1}
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{S^1 \wedge f_n}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f_{n+1}}}
    \\
    S^1 \wedge Y_n &\stackrel{\sigma_n^Y}{\longrightarrow}& Y_{n+1}
    \\
    & \searrow && \searrow
    \\
    && S^1 \wedge B_n &\stackrel{\sigma_n^B}{\longrightarrow}& B_{n+1}
  }
  \;\;\;
  \Rightarrow
  \;\;\;
  \array{
    S^1 \wedge X_n &\stackrel{\sigma_n^X}{\longrightarrow}& X_{n+1}
    \\
    & \searrow^{\mathrlap{S^1 \wedge h_n}} && \searrow^{\mathrlap{h_{n+1}}}
    \\
    && S^1 \wedge A_n &\stackrel{\sigma_n^A}{\longrightarrow}& A_{n+1}
    \\
    && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    && S^1 \wedge B_n &\stackrel{\sigma_n^B}{\longrightarrow}& B_{n+1}
  }
  \,.
$$

Hence a [[lifting]] in the original diagram is a lifting in each degree $n$, such that the lifting in degree $n+1$ makes these diagrams of structure maps commute.

Since components are parameterized over $\mathbb{N}$, this condition has solutions by [[induction]]. First of all there must be an ordinary lifting in degree 0. Then assume a lifting $l_n$ in degree $n$ has been found

$$
  \array{
    X_n &\stackrel{h_n}{\longrightarrow}& A_n
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f_n}} &\nearrow_{\mathrlap{l_n}}& \downarrow
    \\
    Y_n &\longrightarrow& B_n
  }
$$

the lifting $l_{n+1}$ in the next degree has to also make the following diagram commute

$$
  \array{
    S^1 \wedge X_n &\stackrel{\sigma_n^X}{\longrightarrow}& X_{n+1}
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{S^1 \wedge f_n}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f_{n+1}}}
    & \searrow^{\mathrlap{h_{n+1}}}
    \\
    S^1 \wedge Y_n &\stackrel{\sigma_n^Y}{\longrightarrow}& Y_{n+1}
    && 
    \\
    & \searrow^{\mathrlap{S^1 \wedge l_n}} && \searrow^{\mathrlap{l_{n+1}}} & \downarrow
    \\
    && S^1 \wedge A_n &\stackrel{\sigma_n^A}{\longrightarrow}& A_{n+1}
  }
  \,.
$$

This is a [[cocone]] under the commuting square for the structure maps, and therefore the outer diagram is equivalently a morphism out of the [[domain]] of the [[pushout product]] $f_n \Box \sigma_n^X$, while the compatible lift $l_{n+1}$ is equivalently a lift against this pushout product:

$$
  \array{
    S^1 \wedge Y_n 
      \underset{S^1 \wedge X_n}{\sqcup} 
    X_{n+1}
    &\stackrel{(\sigma_n^A \circ S^1 \wedge l_n,h_{n+1})}{\longrightarrow}&
    A_{n+1}
    \\
    \downarrow &{}^{\mathllap{l_{n+1}}}\nearrow& \downarrow
    \\
    Y_{n+1} &\stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}& B_{n+1}

A full proof appears, generalized to a unified proof of model structures in [[highly structured spectra]] in ([Mandell-May-Schwede-Shipley 01](#MMSS00)), which we follow here. We spell out the proof [below](#ProofOfTheStableModelStructureOnSequentialSpectra)


### Proof of the stable model structure
 {#ProofOfTheStableModelStructureOnSequentialSpectra}

We state the proof of theorem \ref{StableModelStructureOnSequentialSpectraIsModelCategory} [below](#StableModelStructureOnDiagramSpectraProof) after a few lemmas.


+-- {: .num_lemma #CorepresentationOfAdjunctStructureMaps}
###### Lemma

The morphisms of [[free spectra]] $\{k_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ from def. \ref{FreeSequentialSpectra} co-represent the adjunct structure maps of sequential spectra:

for $X \in SeqSpec(Top)$, then 

$$
  \array{
    [F_n S^0, X] &\simeq& X_n
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{[k_n,X]}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\tilde \sigma_n^X}}
    \\
    [F_{n+1}S^1, X] &\simeq& \Omega X_{n+1}
  }
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Recall that we are precomposing with

$$
  \array{
    & \vdots && \vdots
    \\
    (k_n)_{n+3} & S^3 &\stackrel{id}{\longrightarrow}& S^3
    \\
    (k_n)_{n+2} & S^2 &\stackrel{id}{\longrightarrow}& S^2
    \\
    (k_n)_{n+1} & S^1 &\stackrel{id}{\longrightarrow}& S^1
    \\
    (k_n)_n \colon & \ast &\stackrel{0}{\longrightarrow}& S^0
    \\
    & \ast &\longrightarrow& \ast
    \\
    & \vdots && \vdots
    \\
    & \ast &\longrightarrow& \ast
    \\
    & \underbrace{\,\,\,} && \underbrace{\,\,\,}
    \\
    k_n \colon & F_{n+1} S^1 &\stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}& F_n S^0
  }
$$


Now for $X$ any sequential spectrum, then a morphism $f \colon F_n S^0 \to X$ is uniquely determined by its $n$th component $f_n \colon S^0 \to X_n$: the compatibility with the structure maps forces the next component, in particular, to be $\sigma_n^X\circ \Sigma f$:

$$
  \array{
    \Sigma S^0 &\stackrel{\Sigma f}{\longrightarrow}& \Sigma X_n
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\sigma_n^X}}
    \\
    S^1 &\stackrel{\sigma_n^X \circ \Sigma f}{\longrightarrow}& X_n
  }
  \,.
$$

But that $(n+1)$st component is just the component that similarly determines the precompositon of $f$ with $k_n$, hence $f\circ k_n$ is uniquely determined by the map $\sigma_n^X \circ \Sigma f$. Therefore $[k_n,-]$ is the function

$$
  [k_n,-]
   \;\colon\;
  X_n 
  = 
  [S^0, X_n]
    \stackrel{f \mapsto \sigma_n^X \circ \Sigma f}{\longrightarrow}
  \Maps(S^1, X_{n+1})
  =
  \Omega X_{n+1}
  \,.
$$

It remains to see that this is indeed the $(\Sigma \dashv \Omega)$-[[adjunct]] of $\sigma_n^X$. By the general formula for adjuncts, this is

$$
  \tilde \sigma_n^X 
    \;\colon\; 
  X_n 
     \stackrel{\eta}{\longrightarrow} 
  \Omega \Sigma X_n
     \stackrel{\Omega \sigma_n^X}{\longrightarrow}
  \Omega X_{n+1}
  \,.
$$

To compare to the above, we check what this does on points: $S^0 \stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow} X_n$ is sent to the composite

$$
   S^0 
     \stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}
   X_n 
     \stackrel{\eta}{\longrightarrow} 
   \Omega \Sigma X_n
     \stackrel{\Omega \sigma_0^X}{\longrightarrow}
   \Omega X_{n+1}
   \,.
$$

To identify this as a map $S^1 \to X_{n+1}$ we use the adjunction isomorphism once more to throw all the $\Omega$-s on the right back to $\Sigma$-s the left, to finally find that this is indeed

$$
  \sigma_n^X \circ \Sigma f
    \;\colon\;
  S^1 = \Sigma S^0 \stackrel{\Sigma f}{\longrightarrow} \Sigma X_n \stackrel{\sigma_n^X}{\longrightarrow} X_{n+1}
  \,.
$$

###### Lemma

1. Every weak equivalence with respect to the strict model structure is a stable weak equivalence.

1. Every stable weak equivalence between [[Omega-spectra]] is a weak equivalence in the strict model structure.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The first statement follows directly from  the definition of stable weak equivalences, since weak equivalences become isomorphisms in the [[homotopy category of a model category|homotopy category]].

For the second statement, let $f \colon X \to Y$ be a stable weak equivalence between [[Omega-spectra]]. Then by definition, in particular

$$
  [f,X]_{strict} \;\colon\; [Y,X]_{strict} \longrightarrow [X,X]_{strict}
$$

is a [[bijection]]. Therefore the pre-image of $[id_X] \in [X,X]_{strict}$ is an inverse to $f$ in the [[homotopy category]] of the strict model structure. Hence $f$ represents an isomorphism in the strict homotopy category and is hence a weak equivalence in the strict model structure.

###### Lemma

Every element in $J_{SeqSpec}^{stable}$ (def. \ref{GeneratingAndGeneratingAcyclicCofibrationsForSeqSpecStable}) is both:

1. a cofibration with respect to the strict model structure of theorem \ref{StrictModelStructureOnSequentialPrespectraIsModelCategory};

1. a stable equivalence (def. \ref{ClassesOfMorphismsOfTheStableModelStructureOnSequentialSpectra}).

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof 

For the elements in $J_{SeqSpec}^{strict}$ this is part of theorem \ref{StrictModelStructureOnSequentialPrespectraIsModelCategory}.
To see that the $k_n \Box i_+$ are strict cofibrations: By [[Joyal-Tierney calculus]] $k_n \Box i_+$ has left lifting against any acyclic strict fibration $f$ precisely if $k_n$ has left lifting against $f^{i_+}$. By $SeqSpec(Top)_{strict}$ behaving like a $Top_{Quillen}$-[[enriched model category]] (with relative CW-complexes in one argument) the latter is still a strict acyclic fibration. Since $k_n$ is evidently a strict cofibration, the lifting follows and hence also $k_n \Box i_+$ is a strict cofibration.


To see that they are stable equivalences: The morphisms $k_n$ by construction, by [[two-out-of-three]] and by lemma \ref{CorepresentationOfAdjunctStructureMaps} are stable equivalences. Hence the [[derived hom-space]] out of $k_n \Box i_+$ is the homotopy pullback of a weak equivalence, hence is a weak equivalence, hence on the homotopy category an iso.

=--


The point of the set $\{k_n \Box i_+\}$ is to make the following true:

+-- {: .num_lemma #KInjectivesAreAcyclicCofibrations}
###### Lemma

A morphism $f \colon X \to Y$ in $SeqSpec(Top)$ is a $J_{SeqSpec}^{stable}$-[[injective morphism]] precisely if 

1. it is fibration in the strict model structure (hence degreewise a fibration)

1. for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the [[commuting squares]] of structure map compatibility on the underlying [[sequential spectra]]

       Y_n &\underset{\tilde \sigma}{\longrightarrow}& \Omega Y_{n+1}

   $$

   exhibit [[homotopy pullbacks]].  


In particular, the $J_{SeqSpec}^{stable}$-[[injective objects]] are precisely the [[Omega-spectra]], def. \ref{OmegaSpectrum}.


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By theorem \ref{StrictModelStructureOnSequentialPrespectraIsModelCategory}, lifting against $J_{SeqSpec}^{stric}$ alone characterizes strict fibrations, hence degreewise fibrations. Lifting against the remaining [[pushout product]] morphism $k_n \Box i_+$ is, by [[Joyal-Tierney calculus]], equivalent to left lifting $i_+$ against the dual pullback product of $f^{k_n}$, which means that $f^{k_n}$ is a weak homotopy equivalence. But by lemma \ref{CorepresentationOfAdjunctStructureMaps}, $f^{k_n}$ is the comparison morphism into the homotopy pullback under consideration.

+-- {: .num_lemma #KInjectiveStableEquivalencesAreStrictEquivalences}
###### Lemma

A morphism in $SeqSpec(Top)$ which is both 

1. a stable weeak equivalence;

1. a $J_{SeqSpec}^{stable}$-[[injective morphism]] 

is an acyclic fibration in the strict model structure, hence is degreewise a [[weak homotopy equivalence]] and [[Serre fibration]] of topological spaces;

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let $f\colon E \to B$ be both a stable equivalence as well as a $J_{SeqSpec}^{stable}$-injective morphism. Since $J_{SeqSpec}^{stable}$ contains the generating acyclic cofibrations for the strict model structure, $f$ is in particular a strict fibration, hence a degreewise fibration. Therefore the [[fiber]] $F$ of $f$ is its [[homotopy fiber]] in the strict model structure. This implies that for any $E$ that with $[f,E]_{strict}$ a bijection, by assumption also $[\ast,E]_{strict} \to [F,E]_{strict}$ is a bijection, hence that $F\to \ast$ is also a stable weak equivalence. 

Observe also that $F$, being the pullback of a $J_{SeqSpec}^{stable}$-injective morphisms (by the standard [closure properties](injective+or+projective+morphism#ClosureProperties)) is a $J_{SeqSpec}^{stable}$-[[injective object]], so that by lemma \ref{KInjectivesAreAcyclicCofibrations} $F$ is an [[Omega-spectrum]]. Together this implies with lemma \ref{StableEquivalencesBetweenOmegaSpectraAreStrictWeakEquivalences} that $F \to \ast$ is a weak equivalence in the strict model structure, hence degreewise a [[weak homotopy equivalence]]. From this the [[long exact sequence of homotopy groups]] implies that $\pi_{\bullet \geq 1}(f_n)$ is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]] for all $n$ and for each homotopy group in positive degree. 

To infer from this the remaining case that also $\pi_0(f_0)$ is an isomorphism, observe that, by assumption of $J_{SeqSpec}^{stable}$-injectivity, lemma \ref{KInjectivesAreAcyclicCofibrations} gives that $f_n$ is a homotopy pullback (in pointed topological spaces) of $\Omega (f_{n+1})$. But, by the above, $\Omega (f_{n+1})$ is a weak homotopy equivalence, since $\pi_\bullet(\Omega(-)) = \pi_{\bullet+1}(-)$. Therefore $f_n$ is the homotopy pullback of a weak homotopy equivalence and hence itself a weak homotopy equivalence.

###### Lemma

The [[retracts]] of $J_{SeqSpec}^{stable}$-[[relative cell complexes]] are precisely the morphisms which are

1. stable equivalences, 

1. as well as strict cofibrations.

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Since all elements of $J_{SeqSpec}^{stable}$ are stable equivalences and strict cofibrations by lemma \ref{ElementsOfKAreStableEquivalencesAndStrictCofibrations}, it follows that every retract of relative $J_{SeqSpec}^{stable}$-cell complex has the same property.

In the other direction, if $f$ is a stable equivalence and strict cofibration, by the [[small object argument]] it factors $f \colon \stackrel{i}{\to}\stackrel{p}{\to}$ as a relative $J_{SeqSpec}^{stable}$-cell complex $i$ followed by a $J_{SeqSpec}^{stable}$-[[injective morphism]] $p$. By the previous statement $i$ is a stable equivalence, and so by assumption and by [[two-out-of-three]] so is $p$. Therefore lemma \ref{KInjectiveStableEquivalencesAreStrictEquivalences} implies that $p$ is a strict acyclic fibration. But then the assumption that $f$ is a strict cofibration mean that it has the [[left lifting property]] against $p$, and so the [[retract argument]] implies that $f$ is a retract of the relative $K$-cell complex $i$.

A morphism in $SeqSpec(Top)$ is both

1. a stable weak equivalence

###### Proof

Every acyclic fibration in the strict model structure in injective with respect to strict cofibrations by the strict model structure; and it is a stable equivalence by item 1 of lemma \ref{StableEquivalencesBetweenOmegaSpectraAreStrictWeakEquivalences}.

Conversely, a morphism injective with respect to strict cofibrations that are stable equivalences is a $K$-[[injective morphism]] by corollary \ref{KInjectivesAreIndeedTheStableFibrations}, and hence if it is also a stable equivalence then by lemma \ref{KInjectiveStableEquivalencesAreStrictEquivalences} it is a strict acylic fibration.

=--

+-- {: .proof #StableModelStructureOnDiagramSpectraProof}
###### Proof
(of theorem \ref{StableModelStructureOnSequentialSpectraIsModelCategory})

The non-trivial points to check are the two [[weak factorization systems]].

That $(Cof_{stable}\cap W_{stable} \;,\; Fib_{stable})$ is a weak factorization system follows from lemma \ref{RetractsOfRelativeKCellComplexesAreTheStableEquivalencesAndStrictCofibrations} and the [[small object argument]]. 

By lemma \ref{StableAcyclicFibrationsAreEquivalentlyStrictAcyclicFibrations} the stable acyclic fibrations are equivalently the strict acyclic fibrations and hence the weak factorization system $(Cof_{stable} \;,\; Fib_{stable} \cap W_{stable})$ is identified with that of the strict model structure $(Cof_{strict} \;,\; Fib_{strict} \cap W_{strict})$.

+-- {: .num_prop #CellSpectraAreCofibrantInModelStructureOnTopologicalSequentialSpectra}
###### Proposition

A [[sequential spectrum]] $X \in SeqSpec(Top_{cg})$ is cofibrant in the strict model structure $SeqSpec(Top_{cg})_{strict}$ of theorem \ref{StrictModelStructureOnSequentialPrespectraIsModelCategory} in particular if all component spaces are [[cell complexes]] and all its structure morphisms $S^1 \wedge X_n \to X_{n+1}$ are [[relative cell complexes]]. In particular [[CW-spectra]], def. \ref{CWSpectrum}, are cofibrant in $SeqSpec(Top)_{strict}$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

A morphism $\ast \to X$ is a cofibration according to def. \ref{ClassesOfMorphismsOfTheStrictModelStructureOnSequentialSpectra} if 

1. $X_0$ is cofibrant, hence a retract of a [[cell complex]];

1. $$
     \ast_{n+1}\underset{S^1 \wedge \ast_n}{\coprod} S^1 \wedge X_n
     \longrightarrow
     X_{n+1}
   $$

   is a cofibration. But in this case the [[pushout]] reduces to just its second summand, and so this is now equivalent to

   $$
     S^1 \wedge X_n \longrightarrow X_{n+1}
   $$

   being cofibrations; hence [[retracts]] of [[relative cell complexes]].

+-- {: .num_prop #CylinderSpectrumOverCWSpectrumIsGood}
###### Proposition

For $X\in SeqSpec(Top)_{stable}$ a [[CW-spectrum]], then its standard [[cylinder spectrum]] $X \wedge (I_+)$ is a _good_ [[cylinder object]] in that the inclusion

$$
  X \vee X \longrightarrow X \wedge (I_+)
$$

is a cofibration in $SeqSpec(Top)_{stable}$.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

According to def. \ref{ClassesOfMorphismsOfTheStrictModelStructureOnSequentialSpectra} we need to check that for all $n$ the morphism

$$
  (X \vee X)_{n+1}
  \underset{S^1 \wedge (X\vee X)_n}{\sqcup}
  S^1 \wedge (X \wedge (I_+))_n
  \longrightarrow
  (X \wedge (I_+))_{n+1}
$$

is a retract of a relative cell complex. After distributing indices and smash products over wedge sums, this is equivalently

$$
  (X_{n+1} \vee X_{n+1})
  \underset{(S^1 \wedge X_n )\vee (S^1 \wedge X_n))}{\sqcup}
   S^1 \wedge X_n \wedge (I_+)
  \longrightarrow
  X_{n+1} \wedge I_+
  \,.
$$

Now by the assumption that $X$ is a [[CW-spectrum]], each $X_{n}$ is a CW-complex, and this implies that $X_n \wedge (I_+)$ is a relative cell complex in $Top^{\ast/}$. With this, inspection shows that also the above morphism is a relative cell complex.

We now turn to discussion of [[CW-approximation]] of sequential spectra. First recall the relative version of CW-approximation for topological spaces:

+-- {: .num_lemma #nConnectedCWApproximationOfContinuousFunction}
###### Lemma

Let $f \;\colon\; A \longrightarrow X$ be a [[continuous function]] between [[topological spaces]]. Then there exists for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ a [[relative CW-complex]] $\hat f \colon A \hookrightarrow \hat Y$ together with an [[extension]] $\phi \colon Y \to X$, i.e.

$$
  \array{

    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\hat f}}\downarrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\phi}}

$$ 

such that $\phi$ is [[n-connected continuous function|n-connected]].

Moreover:

* if $f$ itself is [[n-connected continuous function|k-connected]], then the relative CW-complex $\hat f$ may be chosen to have cells only of [[dimension]] $k + 1 \leq dim \leq n$.

* if $A$ is already a [[CW-complex]], then $\hat f \colon A \to X$ may be chosen to be a subcomplex inclusion.

For every [[continuous function]] $f \colon A \longrightarrow X$ out of a [[CW-complex]] $A$, there exists a [[relative CW-complex]] $\hat f \colon A \longrightarrow \hat X$ that factors $f$ followed by a [[weak homotopy equivalence]]

$$

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Apply lemma \ref{nConnectedCWApproximationOfContinuousFunction} iteratively for all $n$ to produce a sequence with [[cocone]] of the form

$$
  \array{
    A &\overset{f_1}{\longrightarrow}& X_1 &\overset{f_2}{\longrightarrow}& X_2 &\longrightarrow & \cdots
    \\
    &{}_{\mathllap{f}}\searrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\phi_1}} & \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\phi_2}} & \cdots 
    \\
    && X
  }
  \,,
$$

where each $f_i$ is a [[relative CW-complex]] and where $\phi_n$ in [[n-connected continuous function|n-connected]]. 

Let then $\hat X$ be the [[colimit]] over the sequence (its [[transfinite composition]]) and $\hat f \colon A \to X$ the induced component map. By definition of relative CW-complexes, this $\hat f$ is itself a relative CW-complex.

By the [[universal property]] of the colimit this factors $f$ as

$$
  \array{
    A &\overset{f_1}{\longrightarrow}& X_1 &\overset{f_2}{\longrightarrow}& X_2 &\longrightarrow & \cdots
    \\
    &{}_{\mathllap{}}\searrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{}} & \swarrow_{\mathrlap{}} & \cdots 
    \\
    && \hat X
    \\
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\phi}}
    \\
    && X
  }
  \,.
$$

Finally to see that $\phi$ is a weak homotopy equivalence: since [[n-spheres]] are [[compact topological spaces]], then every map $\alpha \colon S^n \to \hat X$ factors through a finite stage $i \in \mathbb{N}$ as $S^n \to X_i \to  \hat X$ (by [this lemma](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#CompactSubsetsAreSmallInCellComplexes)). By possibly including further into higher stages, we may choose $i \gt n$.  But then the above says that further mapping along $\hat X \to X$ is the same as mapping along $\phi_n$, which is $n$-connected and hence an isomorphism on the homotopy class of $\alpha$.

###### Proposition

The $(\Sigma^\infty \dashv \Omega^\infty)$-adjunction from prop. \ref{SigmaInfinityOmegaInfinity} is a [[Quillen adjunction]] ([def.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#QuillenAdjunction)) between the [[classical model structure on pointed topological spaces]] ([thm.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#ClassicalModelStructureOnCompactlyGeneratedTopologicalSpaces), [prop.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#ModelStructureOnSliceCategory)) and the strict [[model structure on topological sequential spectra]] of theorem \ref{StrictModelStructureOnSequentialPrespectraIsModelCategory}:

$$
  (\Sigma^\infty \dashv \Omega^\infty)
  \;\colon\;
  SeqSpec(Top_{cg})_{strict}
    \underoverset
      {\underset{\Omega^{\infty}}{\longrightarrow}}
      {\overset{\Sigma^\infty}{\longleftarrow}}
      {\bot}
  (Top_{cg}^{\ast/})_{Quillen}
  \,.
$$


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let $f \colon X\longrightarrow Y$ be a morphism in $Top^{\ast/}_{cg}$ and 

$$
  \Sigma^\infty f \colon \Sigma^\infty X \longrightarrow \Sigma^\infty Y
$$

its image.

Since, the structure maps in a [[suspension spectrum]], example \ref{SuspensionSpectrum}, are all isomorphisms we have for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ an isomorphism

$$
  (\Sigma^\infty X)_{n+1}
    \underset{S^1 \wedge (\Sigma^\infty X)_n}{\coprod} 
   S^1 \wedge (\Sigma^\infty Y)_n
    \simeq 
  S^1 \wedge (\Sigma^\infty Y)_n
  \,.
$$

Therefore $\Sigma^\infty f$ is a strict cofibration, according to def. \ref{ClassesOfMorphismsOfTheStrictModelStructureOnSequentialSpectra}, precisely if $(\Sigma^\infty f)_0 = f$ is a classical cofibration and all the structure maps of $\Sigma^\infty Y$ are classical cofibrations. But the latter are even isomorphisms, so that this is no extra condition. Hence $\Sigma^\infty$ sends cofibrations to cofibrations.

Furthermore, it is clear that $\Sigma^\infty$ sends weak equivalences to weak  equivalences. Hence it preserves also acyclic cofibrations, hence is a left Quillen functor.

The $(\Sigma \dashv \Omega)$-[[adjunction]] from prop. \ref{AdjunctionsBetweenLoopingAndDeloopingForSeqSpec} is a [[Quillen adjunction]] ([def.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#QuillenAdjunction)) with respect to the strict model structure on sequential spectra of theorem \ref{StrictModelStructureOnSequentialPrespectraIsModelCategory}.

###### Proof

Since the (acyclic) fibrations of $SeqSpec(Top_{cg})_{strict}$ are by definition those morphisms that are degreewise (acylic) fibrations in $(Top^{\ast/}_{cg})_{Quillen}$, the statement follows immediately from the fact that the right adjoint $\Omega$ is degreewise given by $Maps(S^1, -)_\ast \colon (Top^{\ast/}_{cg})_{Quillen} \to (Top^{\ast/}_{cg})_{Quillen}$, which is a right Quillen functor by prop. \ref{SuspensionAndLoopAdjunctionInClassicalHomotopyTheory}.

### Stable equivalences
 {#StableEquivalences}

We discuss the relation between the stable equivalences (def. \ref{ClassesOfMorphismsOfTheStableModelStructureOnSequentialSpectra}) and [[stable weak homotopy equivalences]] (def. \ref{StableWeakHomotopyEquivalenceOfSequentialTopologicalSpectra}).

+-- {: .num_lemma #FakeLoopingPreservesOmegaSpectra}
###### Lemma

With $\Sigma$ and $\Omega$ the alternative suspension and alternative looping functors from def. \ref{SequentialSpectrumFakeSuspension}:

1. $\Omega$ preserves [[Omega-spectra]] (def. \ref{OmegaSpectrum});

1. $\Sigma$ preserves stable weak equivalences (def. \ref{ClassesOfMorphismsOfTheStableModelStructureOnSequentialSpectra}).

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Regarding the first statement:

By prop. \ref{SuspensionAndLoopAdjunctionInClassicalHomotopyTheory}, $\Omega$ acts on component spaces and adjunct structure maps as the [[Quillen adjunction|right Quillen functor]]

$$
  Maps(S^1,-)_\ast
  \;\colon\;
  (Top_{cg}^{\ast/})_{Quillen}
    \longrightarrow
  (Top_{cg}^{\ast/})_{Quillen}
$$

on the [[classical model structure on pointed topological spaces|classical model structure]] on pointed compactly generated topological spaces ([thm.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#ClassicalModelStructureOnCompactlyGeneratedTopologicalSpaces), [prop.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#ModelStructureOnSliceCategory)). Since in this model structure all objects are fibrants, [[Ken Brown's lemma]] ([prop.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#KenBrownLemma)) implies says that with $\tilde \sigma^X_n$ a [[weak homotopy equivalence]], so is
$\tilde \sigma^{\Omega X}_n = Maps(S^1,\tilde \sigma^X_n)$.

Regarding the second statement: 

By prop. \ref{AlternativeSuspensionIsLeftQuillenOnStrictModelStructureOnSequential} $(\Sigma \dashv \Omega)$ is a [[Quillen adjunction]] for the strict model structure, hence (by [this prop.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#QuillenAdjunctionInducesAdjunctionOnHomotopyCategories)) it passes to an adjunction of its [[derived functors]] on the [[homotopy category of a model category|homotopy category]]. 

Therefore with $f$ a stable equivalence and $Y$ any Omega-spectrum, then

$$
  [\Sigma f,Y]_{strict}
  =
  [f,\Omega Y]_{strict}
$$

is an isomorphism by the first statement above, and hence $\Sigma f$ is a stable equivalence.

=--


+-- {: .num_lemma #CounitOfFakeSuspensionAndShiftIsStableEquivalence}
###### Lemma

For $X$ a [[sequential spectrum]], then (using remark \ref{ShiftingCommutesWithLoopingAndSuspensionOfSequentialSpectra} to suppress parenthesis)

1. the structure maps constitute a homomorphism

   $$
     \Sigma X[-1]
     \longrightarrow
     X
   $$

   and this is a stable equivalence (def. \ref{ClassesOfMorphismsOfTheStableModelStructureOnSequentialSpectra}),

1. the adjunct structure maps constitute a homomorphism

   $$
     X
     \longrightarrow
     \Omega X[1]
     \,.
   $$

   If $X$ is an [[Omega-spectrum]] (def. \ref{OmegaSpectrum}) then this is a weak equivalence in the strict model structure (def. \ref{ClassesOfMorphismsOfTheStrictModelStructureOnSequentialSpectra}), hence in particular a stable equivalence (def. \ref{ClassesOfMorphismsOfTheStableModelStructureOnSequentialSpectra}).

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The diagrams that need to commute for the structure maps to give a homomorphism as claimed are in degree 0 this one

$$
  \array{
    S^1 \wedge S^1 \wedge \ast &\overset{0}{\longrightarrow}& X_0
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{S^1 \wedge 0}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\sigma_0}}
    \\
    S^1 \wedge X_0 &\underset{\sigma_0}{\longrightarrow}& X_1
  }
$$

and in degree $n \geq 1$ these:

$$
  \array{
     S^1 \wedge S^1 \wedge X_{n-1} 
        &\overset{S^1 \wedge \sigma_{n-1}}{\longrightarrow}& 
     X_n
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{S^1 \wedge \sigma_{n-1}}}\downarrow
       &&
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\sigma_n}}
     \\
     S^1 \wedge X_{n} 
       &\underset{\sigma_n}{\longrightarrow}& 
     X_{n+1}
  }
  \,.
$$

But in all these cases commutativity it trivially satisfied. 

That the adjunct structure maps constitute a morphism $X \to \Omega X[1]$ follows [[formal dual|dually]].

If $X$ is an [[Omega-spectrum]], then by definition this last morphism is already a weak equivalence in the strict model structure, hence in particular a weak equivalence in the stable model structure.

From this it follows that also the first morphism is a stable equivalence, because for every [[Omega-spectrum]] $Y$ then by the adjunctions in prop. \ref{AdjunctionsBetweenLoopingAndDeloopingForSeqSpec}

$$
  \array{
     [X, Y]_{strict} &\overset{}{\longrightarrow}& [\Sigma X[-1],Y]_{strict}
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{id}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
     \\
     [X,Y]_{strict}  &\underset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}& [X, \Omega Y[1]]_{strict}
  }
  \,.
$$

(To see the commutativity of this last diagram in detail, consider for any $[f] \in [X,Y]_{strict}$ chasing the element $\sigma_n^Y$ in the two possible ways through the natural adjunction isomorphism:

$$
  \array{
    [S^1 \wedge Y_{n-1}, Y_n]
      &\simeq&
    [Y_{n-1}, \Omega Y_n]
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{[S^1 \wedge f_{n-1}, Y_n]}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{[f_{n-1}, \Omega Y_n]}}
    \\
    [S^1 \wedge X_{n-1}, Y_n]
      &\simeq&
    [X_{n-1}, \Omega Y_n]
  }
  \,.
$$

Sending $\sigma_n^Y$ down gives $\sigma_n^Y \circ S^1 \wedge f_{n-1}$ which equals (by the homomorphism property) $f_n \circ \sigma_n^X$. Instead sending $\sigma_n^Y$ to the right yields $\tilde \sigma_n^Y$ and then down yields $\tilde \sigma_n^Y \circ f_{n-1}$. By commutativity this is adjunct to $f_n \circ \sigma_n^X$.)

    \underset{n \in \mathbb{N}}{\sqcup}

Equivalently this is the spectrum whose $n$th component space is a corresponding [[mapping telescope]] of [[pointed topological spaces]] formed via the standard [[reduced cylinder]] ([exmpl.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#StandardReducedCyclinderInTop)) smashed from the right and with structure maps acting independently from the left.

Write

###### Lemma

1. If $X$ is an [[Omega-spectrum]], then $i_X  \colon X \to Q X$ from def. \ref{AlmostSpectrificationForTopologicalSequentialSpectra} is a level weak equivalence (is in $W_{strict}$, def. \ref{ClassesOfMorphismsOfTheStrictModelStructureOnSequentialSpectra}).

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Regarding the first item:

By lemma \ref{FakeLoopingPreservesOmegaSpectra} and lemma \ref{CounitOfFakeSuspensionAndShiftIsStableEquivalence}, if $X$ is an Omega-spectrum then each stage $\Omega^k X[k] \to \Omega^{k+n} X[k+n]$ is in $W_{strict}$. Hence $i_X$ is componentwise a [[mapping telescope]] over [[weak homotopy equivalences]]. Since the [[n-spheres]] are small objects with respect to cell attachments ([lemma](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#CompactSubsetsAreSmallInCellComplexes)) each [[homotopy group]] is represented at a finite stage

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \pi_q( \underset{\longrightarrow}{\holim}_n( (\Omega^n X[n])_k ))
    & \simeq
    \pi_q( \underset{\longrightarrow}{\holim}_n( \Omega^n X_{k+n} ))
    \\
    & \simeq
    \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_n (\pi_q \Omega^n X_{k+n})
    \\
    & \simeq
    \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_n (\pi_{q+n} X_{k+n})
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

Since by lemma \ref{CounitOfFakeSuspensionAndShiftIsStableEquivalence} the components of $i_X \colon X \to Q X$ are given by the iterations of the adjunct structure maps, the claim follows with remark \ref{StableHomotopyGroupsOfOmegaSpectrum}.

The second claim follows with the same kind of reasoning.

=--


+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Let $E$ be an Omega-spectrum (def. \ref{OmegaSpectrum}). Then by the first item of lemma \ref{PropertiesOfAlmostSpectrificationForTopologicalSequentialSpectra}, for every $X$ the morphism

$$
  [X,i_E]_{strict}
    \;\colon\; 
  [X,E]_{strict} 
    \longrightarrow 
  [X, Q E]_{strict}
$$

is an isomorphism. Since $i_{(-)}$ is a [[natural transformation]] (by def. \ref{PropertiesOfAlmostSpectrificationForTopologicalSequentialSpectra}), the naturality squares give a factorization of this morphism as

$$
  [X,i_E]_{strict}
    \;\colon\;
  [X,E]_{strict} 
    \stackrel{Q}{\longrightarrow}
  [Q X, Q E]_{strict}
    \stackrel{[i_X,E]_{strict}}{\longrightarrow}
  [X, Q]_{strict}  
  \,.
$$

Combining this with vertical morphisms as below, which are isomorphisms again by item 1 of lemma \ref{PropertiesOfAlmostSpectrificationForTopologicalSequentialSpectra},

$$
  \array{
     &
      &&
    [Q X, E]_{strict}

      &\stackrel{Q}{\longrightarrow}&
    [Q X, Q E]_{strict}
      &\stackrel{[i_X, Q E]_{strict}}{\longrightarrow}&
    [X, Q E]_{strict}

$$

exhibits a [[retraction]] 

$$
  id \;\colon\; [X,E]_{strict} \longrightarrow [Q X,E]_{strict} \longrightarrow [X,E]_{strict}
  \,,
$$ 

which is natural in $X$ (that the bottom and right composite is indeed the identity is again the naturality of $i_{(-)}$). This naturality now implies a retraction of morphisms

$$
  \array{
    id_{[Y,E]_{strict}} \colon & [Y,E]_{strict} &\longrightarrow& [Q Y,E]_{strict} &\longrightarrow& [Y,E]_{strict}
    \\
    & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{[f,E]_{strict}}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{[Q f,E]_{strict}}}
     &&
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{[f,E]_{strict}}}
    \\
    id_{[X,E]_{strict}} \colon & [X,E]_{strict} &\longrightarrow& [Q X,E]_{strict} &\longrightarrow& [X,E]_{strict}
  }
  \,.
$$

Finally, by the second item of lemma \ref{PropertiesOfAlmostSpectrificationForTopologicalSequentialSpectra}, the middle vertical morphism here is an isomorphism, hence $[f^\ast, E]_{strict}$ is the retract of an iso and hence ([prop.](retract#RetractOfIso)) an isomorphism itself, for all Omega-spectra $E$. This means by definition that $f$ is a stable equivalence.

In order to prove that this is the case for $SeqSpec(Top_{cg})$ we first relate now the operations of "standard suspension" (def. \ref{SequentialSpectrumRealSuspension}) and of "alternative suspension" (def. \ref{SequentialSpectrumFakeSuspension}) to each other. The former is manifestly a model for the correct suspension, but the latter is better behaved, so we will show that they are naturally isomorphic in the stable homotopy category. According to remark \ref{StandardAndAlternativeSuspensionAreNotDirectlyComparable} both are directly comparable and isomorphic in even degrees, but non-comparable in odd degree. Therefore we now first introduce the concept of sequential spectra with components only in even degree and then use an adjunction back to ordinary sequential spectra.

Since here the left map is an identity, this uniquely fixes the odd-graded components $f_{2n+1}$ in terms of the even-graded components. Moreover, these components then make following pasting rectangles comute

$$
  \array{
    S^2 \wedge \mathcal{X}_{2n} &\overset{S^2 \wedge f_{2n}}{\longrightarrow}& 
    S^2 \wedge Y_{2 n}

    \\
    \mathcal{X}_{2n+2} &\overset{f_{2n+2}}{\longrightarrow}& Y_{2n+2}
  }
  \,.
$$

This equivalently exhibits $f_\bullet$ as a homomorphism

$$
  \tilde f
    \;\colon\;
  \mathcal{X} \longrightarrow R_2 Y
  \,.
$$

Finally to see that the [[adjunction unit]] is a [[stable weak homotopy equivalence]]: for $X \in SeqSpec(Top_{cg})$ then the morphism of stable homotopy groups induced from 

$$
  L_2 R_2 X \longrightarrow X
$$

is in degree $q$

$$
  \array{
     \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim} (\cdots &\to& \pi_{q+2k}(X_{2k}) && \longrightarrow && \pi_{q+2k+2}(X_{q+2k+2}) &\to& \cdots ) &=&

     \pi_q(X)

  \,.
$$

From this it is clear that the induced vertical map on the right is an isomorphism. (Technically: the inclusion of [[partially ordered sets]] $\mathbb{N}_{even}^{\leq} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{N}^{\leq}$ is a [[cofinal functor]] and hence restriction along it preserves colimits.)

There is a [[natural isomorphism]] in the [[stable homotopy category]] (def. \ref{TheStableHomotopyCategory}) between the total [[derived functors]] ([prop.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#QuillenAdjunctionInducesAdjunctionOnHomotopyCategories)) of the standard suspension (def. \ref{SequentialSpectrumRealSuspension}) and of the alternative suspension (def. \ref{SequentialSpectrumFakeSuspension}):

$$

(e.g. [Jardine 15, prop. 10.53](sequential#spectrum#Jardine15))

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Consider the adjunction $(L_2 \dashv R_2) \colon SeqSpec(Top) \leftrightarrow Seq_2Spec(Top)$ from lemma \ref{AdjunctionBetweenSequentialSpectraAndSequentialS2Spectra}.

Via the discussion in remark \ref{StandardAndAlternativeSuspensionAreNotDirectlyComparable}, there is a [[natural isomorphism]] in $Seq_2 Spec(Top)$ between the image under $R_2$ of the two suspension operations

$$
  \tau \;\colon\; R_2 (\Sigma(-)) \simeq R_2((-)\wedge S^1)
  \,,
$$

whose components are given by the [[smash product]]-[[braiding]] isomorphisms

$$
  S^2 \wedge (-) 
    \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  (-) \wedge S^2
  \,.
$$

By lemma \ref{AdjunctionBetweenSequentialSpectraAndSequentialS2Spectra} the [[adjunction unit]] is a stable weak equivalence, so that we get a natural [[zig-zag]] of stable weak equivalences:

$$
  \Sigma X
    \underset{\in W_{st}}{\longleftarrow} 
  L_2 R_2 (\Sigma X) 
    \underoverset{\in Iso \subset W_{st}}{L\tau}{\longrightarrow}
  L_2 R_2 (X \wedge S^1)
    \underset{\in W_{st}}{\longrightarrow}
  X \wedge S^1
  \,.
$$

So restricted to $X$ a cofibrant-object, this gives a natural isomorphism $\Sigma X \to X \wedge S^1$ in the [[stable homotopy category]] $Ho(SeqSpec(Top_{cg})_{stable})$.

The total derived functor of $\Sigma$ exists because by prop. \ref{FakeLoopingPreservesOmegaSpectra} $\Sigma$ preserves stable equivalences. Also the shift functor $[-1]$ from def. \ref{ShiftedSpectrum} clearly preserves stable equivalences, hence both descend to the homotopy category. 
There, by prop. \ref{CounitOfFakeSuspensionAndShiftIsStableEquivalence}

###### Proof

By lemma \ref{StandardSuspensionOfSequentialSpectraRepresentsCanonicalSuspension}, the canonical suspension functor is represented, on fibrant-cofibrant objects, by the standard suspension functor of def. \ref{SequentialSpectrumRealSuspension}.
By prop. \ref{IsomorphismBetweenStandardAndAlternativeSuspensionInHomotopyCategory} however, this is naturally isomorphic -- on the level of the homotopy category -- to the alternative suspension operation of def. \ref{SequentialSpectrumFakeSuspension}. Therefore the claim follows with prop. \ref{FakeSuspensionInducesEquivalenceOfHomotopyCategories}.

In fact this lifts to a Quillen equivalence:

###### Proposition

The $(\Sigma \dashv \Omega)$-[[adjunction]] from prop. \ref{AdjunctionsBetweenLoopingAndDeloopingForSeqSpec} is a [[Quillen equivalence]] ([def.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#QuillenEquivalence)) with respect to the stable model structure of theorem \ref{StableModelStructureOnSequentialSpectraIsModelCategory}:

$$

     {\simeq_{\mathrlap{Q}}}
  SeqSpec(Top_{cg})_{stable}
  \,.
$$


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By prop. \ref{AlternativeSuspensionIsLeftQuillenOnStrictModelStructureOnSequential} and the fact that the stable model structure has the same cofibrations as the strict model structure,  $\Sigma$ preserves stable cofibrations. Moreover, by lemma \ref{FakeLoopingPreservesOmegaSpectra} $\Sigma$ preserves in fact all stable weak equivalences. Hence $\Sigma$ is a left Quillen functor and so $(\Sigma \dashv \Omega)$ is a [[Quillen adjunction]].

With this, lemma \ref{FakeSuspensionInducesEquivalenceOfHomotopyCategories} gives that this Quillen adjunction is a Quillen equivalence.

In summary, this concludes the characterization of the [[stable homotopy category]] as the result of stabilizing the canonucal $(\Sigma \dashv \Omega)$-adjunction on the [[classical homotopy category]]:

### The stable homotopy category 


+-- {: .num_defn #TheStableHomotopyCategory}
###### Definition

Write

$$
  Ho(Spectra)
  \coloneqq
  Ho(SeqSpec(Top_{cg})_{stable})
$$

for the [[homotopy category of a model category|homotopy category]] of the stable [[model structure on topological sequential spectra]] from theorem \ref{StableModelStructureOnSequentialSpectraIsModelCategory}. 

This is called the **[[stable homotopy category]]**.

=--

The [[stable homotopy category]] of def. \ref{TheStableHomotopyCategory} inherits particularly nice properties that are usefully axiomatized for themselves. This axiomatics is called _[[triangulated category]]_ structure (def. \ref{CategoryWithCofiberSequences} below) where the "triangles" are referring to the structure of the long fiber sequences and long cofiber sequences ([prop.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#LongFiberSequence)) which happen to coincide in stable homotopy theory.

#### Additivity
 {#AdditivityOfTheStableHomotopyCategory}


+-- {: .num_lemma #StableHomotopyCategoryHasCoproducts}
###### Lemma

The [[stable homotopy category]] (def. \ref{TheStableHomotopyCategory}) has [[finite product|finite]] [[coproducts]]. They are represented by [[wedge sums]] (example \ref{WedgeSumOfSpectra}) of [[CW-spectra]] (def. \ref{CWSpectrum}).

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Having finite coproducts means having empty coproducts, which are [[initial objects]], and having binary coproducts. 

Regarding the initial object:

The spectrum $\Sigma^\infty \ast$ ([[suspension spectrum]] (example \ref{SuspensionSpectrum}) on the point) is both an [[initial object]] and a [[terminal object]] in $SeqSpec(Top_{cg})$. This implies in particular that it is both fibrant and cofibrant. Finally its standard [[cylinder spectrum]] (example \ref{StandardCylinderSpectrumSequential}) is trivial $(\Sigma^\infty \ast) \wedge (I_+)\simeq \Sigma^\infty \ast$. All together with means that for $X$ any fibrant-cofibrant spectrum, then 

$$
  Hom_{Ho(Spectra)}(\Sigma^\infty \ast, Z)
  \simeq
  Hom_{SeqSpec}(\Sigma^\infty \ast, Z)/_\sim
  \simeq
  \ast
  \,.
$$

Now regarding binary coproducts:

By prop. \ref{CWApproximationForSequentialSpectra} and prop. \ref{CellSpectraAreCofibrantInModelStructureOnTopologicalSequentialSpectra}, every spectrum has a cofibrant replacement by a [[CW-spectrum]]. By prop. \ref{ClosureOfCWSpectra} the [[wedge sum]] $X \wedge Y$ of two CW-spectra is still a CW-spectrum, hence still cofibrant. 

Let $P$ and $Q$ be fibrant and cofibrant replacement functors, respectively, as in _[Prelude -- The homotopy category](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#TheHomotopyCategory).

We claim now that $P(X \wedge Y) \in Ho(Spectra)$ is the coproduct of $P X$ with $P Y$ in $Ho(Spectra)$. By definition of the [[homotopy category of a model category|homotopy category]] ([def.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#HomotopyCategoryOfAModelCategory)) this is equivalent to claiming that for $Z$ any stable fibrant spectrum then there is a [[natural isomorphism]]

$$
  Hom_{SeqSpec}(P(X \wedge Y), Q Z)/_\sim
  \simeq
  Hom_{SeqSpec}(P X, Q Z)/_\sim \times Hom_{SeqSpec}(P Y, Q Z)/_\sim
$$

between [[left homotopy]]-classes of morphisms of sequential spectra.

But since $X \vee Y$ is cofibrant and $Z$ is fibrant, there is a natural isomorphism ([prop.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#HomsOutOfCofibrantIntoFibrantComputeHomotopyCategory))

$$
  Hom_{SeqSpec}(P(X \wedge Y), Q Z)/_\sim
  \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  Hom_{SeqSpec}(X \wedge Y, Z)/_\sim  
  \,.
$$

Now the wedge sum $X \vee Y$ is the coproduct in $SeqSpec(Top_{cg})$, and hence morphisms out of it are indeed in natural bijection with pairs of morphisms out of the two summands. But we need this property to hold still after dividing out left homotopy. The key is that smash tensoring (def. \ref{TensoringAndPoweringOfSequentialSpectra}) distributes over wedge sum

$$
  (X \vee Y) \wedge (I_+) \simeq (X \wedge (I_+)) \vee (Y\wedge (I_+))
$$

(due to the fact that the [[smash product]] of compactly generated [[pointed topological spaces]] distributes this way over wedge sum of pointed spaces). This means that also left homotopies out of $X \vee Y$ are in natural bijection with pairs of left homotopies out of the summands separately, and hence that there is a natural isomorphism

$$
  Hom_{SeqSpec}(X \wedge Y, Z)/_\sim  
  \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  Hom_{SeqSpec}(X,Z)/_\sim \times Hom_{SeqSpec}(Y,Z)/_\sim
  \,.
$$

Finally we may apply the inverse of the natural isomorphism used before ([prop.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#HomsOutOfCofibrantIntoFibrantComputeHomotopyCategory)) to obtain in total

$$
  Hom_{SeqSpec}(X,Z)/_\sim \times Hom_{SeqSpec}(Y,Z)/_\sim
  \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  Hom_{SeqSpec}(P X,Q Z)/_\sim \times Hom_{SeqSpec}(P Y,Q Z)/_\sim
  \,.
$$

The composite of all these isomorphisms proves the claim.

+-- {: .num_lemma #StableHomotopyCategoryIsAbEnriched}
###### Lemma

Consider the group structure on [[hom-sets]] of the [[stable homotopy category]] (def. \ref{TheStableHomotopyCategory}) which is induced from the fact ([prop.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#LoopingAsFunctorOnHomotopyCategory)) that the [[hom-sets]] of any [[homotopy category of a model category|homotopy category]] into an object in the image of the canonical loop space functor $\Omega$ inherit group structure, together with the fact (theorem \ref{StableModelStructureOnSequentiaSpectraIsStableModelCategory}) that on the [[stable homotopy category]] $\Omega$ has an inverse $\Sigma$, so that

$$
  Hom_{Ho(Spectra)}(X,Y)
  \simeq
  Hom_{(Ho(Spectra))}(X, \Omega \Sigma Y)
  \,.
$$

This group structure is [[abelian group|abelian]] and [[composition]] is [[bilinear map|bilinear]] with respect to it. (Hence this makes $Ho(Spectra)$ an _[[Ab-enriched category]]_.)

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Recall ([prop](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#LoopingAsFunctorOnHomotopyCategory), [rmk.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#ConcatenatedLoopSpaceObject)) that the group structure is given by concatenation of loops 

$$
  X 
    \overset{\Delta_X}{\to}
  X \times X
    \overset{(f,g)}{\longrightarrow}
  \Omega \Sigma X \times \Omega \Sigma X
  \overset{}{\longrightarrow}
  \Omega \Sigma X
  \,.
$$


That the group structure is abelian follows via the [[Eckmann-Hilton argument]] from the fact that there is always a compatible second (and indeed arbitrarily many compatible) further group structures, since 

$$
  Hom_{Ho(Spectra)}(X,Y)
    \simeq
  Hom_{(Ho(Spectra))}(X, \Omega \Sigma Y)
    \simeq
  Hom_{(Ho(Spectra))}(X, \Omega \circ (\Omega \Sigma) \circ \Sigma Y)
    =
  Hom_{(Ho(Spectra))}(X, \Omega^2 \Sigma^2 Y)
  \,.
$$

That composition distributes over composition in this group structure is the naturality of the loop composition map, which is evident from the standard model ([rmk.](Introduction+to+Stable+homotopy+theory+--+P#ConcatenatedLoopSpaceObject))

$$
  \array{
    \Omega \Sigma X \times \Omega \Sigma X

In summary, lemma \ref{StableHomotopyCategoryHasCoproducts} and lemma \ref{StableHomotopyCategoryIsAbEnriched} state that the [[stable homotopy category]] is an [[Ab-enriched category]] with finite [[coproducts]]. This is called an _[[additive category]]_:
 
+-- {: .num_defn #AdditiveCategory}
###### Definition

An **[[additive category]]** is a [[category]] which is

1. an [[Ab-enriched category]];

   (sometimes called a [[pre-additive category]]--this means that each [[hom-set]] carries the structure of an [[abelian group]] and composition is [[bilinear map|bilinear]])

1. which admits [[finite limit|finite]] [[coproducts]] 

   (and hence, by prop. \ref{ProductsAreBiproducts} below, finite [[products]] which coincide with the coproducts, hence finite [[biproducts]]).

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #ProductsAreBiproducts}
###### Proposition

In an [[Ab-enriched category]], a [[finite product|finite]] [[product]] is also a [[coproduct]], and dually.  

This statement includes the zero-ary case: any [[terminal object]] is also an [[initial object]], hence a [[zero object]] (and dually), hence every [[additive category]] (def. \ref{AdditiveCategory}) has a [[zero object]].  

More precisely, for $\{X_i\}_{i \in I}$ a [[finite set]] of objects in an Ab-enriched category, then the unique morphism 

$$
  \underset{i \in I}{\coprod} X_i \longrightarrow \underset{j \in I}{\prod} X_j
$$

whose components are identities for $i = j$ and are [[zero morphism|zero]] otherwise is an [[isomorphism]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

Consider first the zero-ary case. Given an [[initial object]] $\emptyset$ and a [[terminal object]] $\ast$, observe that since the [[hom-sets]] $Hom(\emptyset,\emptyset)$ and $Hom(\ast,\ast)$ by definition contain a single element, this element has to be the zero element in the abelian group structure. But it also has to be the identity morphism, and hence $id_\emptyset = 0$ and $id_{\ast} = 0$. It follows that the 0-element in $Hom(\ast, \emptyset)$ is a left and right inverse to the unique element in $Hom(\emptyset,\ast)$, and so this is an [[isomorphism]]

$$
  0 \;\colon\; \emptyset \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} \ast
  \,.
$$

Consider now the case of binary (co-)products. Using the existence of the [[zero object]], hence of [[zero morphisms]], then in addition to its canonical [[projection]] maps $p_i \colon X_1 \times X_2 \to X_i$, any binary [[product]] also receives "injection" maps $X_i \to X_1 \times X_2$, and dually for the [[coproduct]]:

$$
  \array{  
    X_1 && && X_2
    \\
    & \searrow^{\mathrlap{(id,0)}} && {}^{\mathllap{(0,id)}}\swarrow
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{id_{X_1}}}\downarrow && X_1 \times X_2 && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{id_{X_2}}}
    \\
    & \swarrow_{\mathrlap{p_{X_1}}} && {}_{\mathllap{p_{X_2}}}\searrow
    \\
    X_1 && && X_2
  }
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\,,\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \array{  
    X_1 && && X_2
    \\
    & \searrow^{\mathrlap{i_{X_1}}} && {}^{\mathllap{i_{X_2}}}\swarrow
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{id_{X_1}}}\downarrow 
     && X_1 \sqcup X_2 && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{id_{X_2}}}
    \\
    & \swarrow_{\mathrlap{(id,0)}} && {}_{\mathllap{(0,id)}}\searrow
    \\
    X_1 && && X_2
  }
  \,.
$$

Then using the additivity of morphisms, it follows that for $f_i \;\colon\; X_i \to Q$ any two morphisms, the sum 

$$
  \phi \;\colon\; f_1 \circ p_1 + f_2 \circ p_2
$$

gives a morphism of [[cocones]]

$$
  \array{  
    X_1 && && X_2
    \\
    & \searrow^{\mathrlap{(id,0)}} && {}^{\mathllap{(0,id)}}\swarrow

$$

Moreover, this is in fact unique: suppose $\phi'$ is another morphism filling this diagram, then 

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    (\phi-\phi')
    & = 
    (\phi - \phi') \circ id_{X_1 \times X_2}
    \\
    &= 
    (\phi - \phi') \circ ( (id_{X_1},0) \circ p_1 + (0,id_{X_2})\circ p_2 )
    \\
    & =
    \underset{ = 0}{\underbrace{(\phi - \phi') \circ (id_{X_1}, 0)}} \circ p_1
    + 
    \underset{ = 0}{\underbrace{(\phi - \phi') \circ (0, id_{X_2})}} \circ p_2
    \\
    & = 0
  \end{aligned}
$$

and hence $\phi = \phi'$. This means that $X_1\times X_2$ satisfies the [[universal property]] of a [[coproduct]].

By a [[formal dual|dual]] argument, the binary coproduct $X_1 \sqcup X_2$ is seen to also satisfy the universal property of the binary product. By [[induction]], this implies the statement for all finite (co-)products.

###### Remark

Finite coproducts coinciding with products as in prop. \ref{ProductsAreBiproducts} ar also called _[[biproducts]]_ or _[[direct sums]]_, denoted

Conversely:

+-- {: .num_defn #SemiadditiveCategory}
###### Definition

A **[[semiadditive category]]** is a [[category]] that has all [[finite products]] which, moreover, are [[biproducts]] in that they coincide with finite [[coproducts]] as in def. \ref{ProductsAreBiproducts}.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #SemiAdditivityInducesAbelianMonoidEnrichment}
###### Proposition

In a [[semiadditive category]], def. \ref{SemiadditiveCategory}, the [[hom-sets]] acquire the structure of [[commutative monoids]] by defining the sum of two morphisms $f,g \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Y$ to be

$$
  f + g 
    \;\coloneqq\;
  X \overset{\Delta_X}{\to} X \times X
  \simeq
  X \oplus X
  \overset{f \oplus g}{\longrightarrow}
  Y \oplus Y
  \simeq
  Y \sqcup Y
  \overset{\nabla_X}{\to}
  Y
  \,.
$$

With respect to this operation, [[composition]] is [[bilinear map|bilinear]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The [[associativity]] and commutativity of $+$ follows directly from the corresponding properties of $\oplus$. Bilinearity of composition follows from [[natural transformation|naturality]] of the [[diagonal]] $\Delta_X$ and [[codiagonal]] $\nabla_X$.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #SemiaddtiveStructureUnderlyingAdditiveInducesOriginalEnrichment}
###### Proposition

Given an [[additive category]] according to def. \ref{AdditiveCategory}, then the enrichement in [[commutative monoids]] which is induced on it via prop. \ref{ProductsAreBiproducts} and prop. \ref{SemiAdditivityInducesAbelianMonoidEnrichment} from its underlying [[semiadditive category]] structure coincides with the original enrichment.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We may write the formula for the addition of two morphisms induced by semiadditve structure equivalently as

$$
  f+g \;\colon\; 
  X \overset{\Delta_X}{\to} X \times X
  \overset{(f,g)}{\longrightarrow}
  Y \times Y
  \overset{p_1 + p_2}{\longrightarrow}
  Y
$$

where the last morphism is identified as the sum of the two projections as in the proof of prop. \ref{ProductsAreBiproducts}. This implies the claim.

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

Prop. \ref{SemiaddtiveStructureUnderlyingAdditiveInducesOriginalEnrichment} says that being an [[additive category]] is an extra [[property]] on a category, not extra [[structure]]. We may ask whether a given category is additive or not, without specifying beforehand with respect to which abelian group structure on the hom-sets.

In conclusion we have:

+-- {: .num_prop #TheStableHomotopyCategoryIsAdditive}
###### Proposition

The [[stable homotopy category]] (def. \ref{TheStableHomotopyCategory}) is an [[additive category]] (def. \ref{AdditiveCategory}).

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By lemma \ref{StableHomotopyCategoryHasCoproducts} and lemma \ref{StableHomotopyCategoryIsAbEnriched}.

=--

Hence prop. \ref{ProductsAreBiproducts} implies that in the stable homotopy category finite coproducts and finite products agree, in that they are finite [[biproducts]]. We may also check this explicitly:

+-- {: .num_lemma}
###### Lemma

For $X,Y \in SeqSpec(Top_{cg})$, then the canonical morphism

$$
  X \vee Y 
   \longrightarrow
  X \times Y
$$

out of the [[coproduct]] ([[wedge sum]], example \ref{WedgeSumOfSpectra}) into the [[product]] (via prop. \ref{LimitsAndColimitsOfSequentialSpectra}), given by

$$
  \array{  
    X && && Y

    \\
    & \swarrow_{\mathrlap{p_X}} && {}_{\mathllap{p_Y}}\searrow
    \\
    X && && Y
  }
$$

represents an [[isomorphism]] in the [[stable homotopy category]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

We may represent both $X$ and $Y$ by [[CW-spectra]] in $(SeqSpec(Top_{cg})_{stable})_c[W_{st}^{-1}]$. Then the canonical morphism 

$$
  i_X \colon X \longrightarrow X \vee Y
$$

is a stable cofibration, because $X_{n+1}\underset{S^1 \wedge X_n}{\sqcup} S^1 (X \vee Y) \simeq X_{n+1} \vee S^1 \wedge Y_n$.

Hence its ordinary cofiber, which is $Y$,  is its homotopy cofiber, hence we have a homotopy cofiber sequence

$$
  X \longrightarrow X \vee Y \longrightarrow Y
$$

moreover, under forming [[stable homotopy groups]], the the inclusion map evidently gives an injection, and the projection map gives a surjection. Hence the [[long exact sequence of homotopy groups]] gives a [[short exact sequence]]

$$
  0 \to
  \pi_\bullet(X)
  \longrightarrow
  \pi_\bullet(X \vee Y)
  \longrightarrow
  \pi_\bullet(Y)
  \to 
  0
  \,.
$$

Moreover, due to the fact that the inclusion and projection for one of the two summands constitute a [[retraction]], this is a [[split exact sequence]], hence exhibits an isomorphism

$$
  \pi_k(X \vee Y)  
  \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  \pi_k(X)\oplus \pi_k(Y)
$$

for all $k$. But this just says that $X \vee Y \to X \times Y$ is a [[stable weak homotopy equivalence]].

#### Triangulated structure
 {#TriangulatedStructure}



+-- {: .num_defn #CategoryWithCofiberSequences}
###### Definition

A **[[triangulated category]]** is

1. an [[additive category]] $Ho$ (def. \ref{AdditiveCategory});

1. a functor, called the **suspension functor** or **[[shift functor]]**

   $$
     \Sigma \;\colon\; Ho \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} Ho
   $$

   which is required to be an [[equivalence of categories]];

1. a sub-[[class]] $CofSeq \subset Mor(Ho^{\Delta[3]})$ of the class of triples of composable morphisms, called the class of **distinguished triangles**, where each element is of the form

   $$
     A \overset{}{\longrightarrow} B \overset{}{\longrightarrow}  \overset{}{\longrightarrow} \Sigma A
     \,,
   $$

   which is also denoted as

   $$
     \array{
        A && \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} && B
        \\
        & {}_{\mathllap{[1]}}\nwarrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{}}
        \\
        && B/A
     }
   $$

   (whence the name);

such that the following conditions hold:

* **T0** If $(f,g,h)$ is a distinguished triangle and there is a [[commuting diagram]] in $Ho$ of the form

  $$
    \array{    
     A &\overset{}{\longrightarrow}& B &\overset{g}{\longrightarrow}& B/A &\overset{h}{\longrightarrow}& \Sigma A      
     \\
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in Iso}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in Iso}} 
     && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in Iso}}
     && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\in Iso}}
     \\
     A' &\overset{f'}{\longrightarrow}& B' &\overset{g'}{\longrightarrow}& B'/A' &\overset{h'}{\longrightarrow}& \Sigma A'      
     
    }
  $$

  then $(f',g',h')$ is also a distinguished triangle;


* **T1** For every object $X \in Ho$ then $(0,id_X,0)$ is a distinguished triangle

  $$
    0 \longrightarrow X \overset{id_X}{\longrightarrow} X 
    \overset{}{\longrightarrow} 0
    \,;
  $$


* **T2** If $(f,g,h)$ is a distinguished triangle, then so is $(g,h, - \Sigma f)$ and conversely; hence if

  $$
    A \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} B \overset{g}{\longrightarrow} B/A \overset{h}{\longrightarrow} \Sigma A
  $$

  is, then so is

  $$
    B \overset{g}{\longrightarrow} B/A \overset{h}{\longrightarrow} \Sigma A \overset{-\Sigma f}{\longrightarrow} \Sigma B
  $$

  and conversely.

* **T3** Given a [[commuting diagram]] in $Ho$ of the form

  $$
    \array{    
     A &\overset{}{\longrightarrow}& 
     B &\overset{}{\longrightarrow}& 
     B/A &\overset{}{\longrightarrow}& \Sigma A      
     \\
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\phi_A}}
     && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\phi_B}} 
     && 
     && 
     \\
     A' &\overset{}{\longrightarrow}& B' &\overset{}{\longrightarrow}& B'/A' &\overset{}{\longrightarrow}& \Sigma A'           
    }
  $$

  where the top and bottom are distinguished triangles, then there exists a morphism $B/A \to B'/A'$ such as to make the completed diagram commute
  
  $$
    \array{    
     A &\overset{}{\longrightarrow}& B &\overset{}{\longrightarrow}& B/A &\overset{}{\longrightarrow}& \Sigma A      
     \\
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\phi_A}}
     && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\phi_B}} 
     && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\exists}}
     && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\Sigma \phi_A}}
