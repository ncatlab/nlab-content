## Idea

A _foliation_ of a [[manifold]] $X$ is a decomposition into [[submanifolds]] in a well-behaved way. These submanifolds are called the _leaves_ of the foliation and one says that $X$ is _foliated by the leaves_.

For [[smooth manifolds]] $X$, foliations arise (and this was the historical motivation for introducing them in ([Ehresmann](#Ehresmann)), ([Reeb](#Reeb))) from subbundles of the [[tangent bundle]] $E \hookrightarrow T X$ which are [[integrable distributions]] (in that the [[Lie bracket]] of [[vector fields]] that are [[sections]] of $E$ is again a section of $E$): the leaves are the submanifolds whose tangent vectors are sections of $E$. If one thinks of $E$ as encoding a [[differential equation]] then the leaves are the solution spaces to this equation.

Expressed in terms of [[higher Lie theory]] such an integrable distribution is a sub-[[Lie algebroid]] of the [[tangent Lie algebroid]] of $X$. Accordingly, under [[Lie integration]] of this structure foliations of $X$ are also equivalently encodes as [[Lie groupoids]] whose space of objects is $X$ and whose [[orbits]] are the leaves of the foliation.

Moreover, foliations are classified by [[Cech cohomology]] [[cocycles]] with coefficients in a [[topological groupoid]]/[[Lie groupoid]] called the _[[Haefliger groupoid]]_. These relations make foliation theory of sub-topic of [[Lie groupoid]]-theory. See also at _[[motivation for higher differential geometry]]_.

## Definition

Let $M$ be an $n$-[[dimension]]al topological [[manifold]]. A decomposition of $M$ as a [[disjoint union]] of [[connected topological space|connected]] subsets $V_\alpha$, called **leaves**, 

$$ M  = \cup_\alpha V_\alpha $$

is called a **foliation** if there is a [[cover]] of $M$ by a collection of "special" [[charts]] of the form $(U, \phi)$, $\phi = (\phi_1,\ldots,\phi_n) : U \to \mathbb{R}^n$ such that for each "special" chart and each $\alpha$ there is a number $p\leq n$, called the _dimension of the foliation_, such that the intersection of any given leaf $V_\alpha$ with $U$ is one of the level sets, i.e. the solution of the system $\phi_r(x) = const = const(r,U,\alpha)$ for all $r\gt p$.

If the manifold is a [[smooth manifold]], the charts may be required to be smooth too, to obtain the notion of a _smooth foliation_ or _folitation in [[differential geometry]]_. In this case, the $p$-dimensional foliations with underlying manifold $X$ are in 1-1 correspondence with [[integrable distributions]] of hyperplanes of dimension $p$ in the [[tangent bundle]] of $X$. 

Foliatons are classified by maps into the [[Haefliger groupoid]]. More generally this yields _[[Haefliger structures]]_, a slight generalization of the notion of foliation.
 
## Examples

* Every [[Lie groupoid]] gives a folitation on its space of [[objects]]: the leaves are the [[orbits]]. Conversely, every regular foliation gives rise to its [[holonomy groupoid]]. This is a (not necessarily Hausdorff) Lie groupoid whose orbits are the leaves of the original foliation, and which in some sense is minimal with this condition.

* Every [[Poisson manifold]] has a canonical structure of a foliation whose leaves are its maximal [[symplectic manifold|symplectic]] submanifolds, called *[[symplectic leaves]]*.

## Properties

### Leaf space

The set of components of a foliation is typically non-[[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]], which is one of the motivations of the [[Alain Connes|Connes]]-style [[noncommutative geometry]]. 

### Classification

Folitation are classified by the [[Haefliger groupoid]]. See at _[[Haefliger theorem]]_.

### Characteristic classes

There is a theory of [[characteristic classes]] for foliations. A most well known example is the Godbillon-Vey characteristic class.
