## Idea

In [[formal logic]] and [[model theory]], _interpretation_ refers to equipping the [[syntax]] of some [[theory]] with a [[semantics]].

Specifically in the context of [[categorical logic]] given a [[theory]] $T$ then an interpretation for it in some [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$ is a [[functor]] $Syn(T) \longrightarrow \mathcal{C}$ from the [[syntactic category]] of $T$ to $\mathcal{C}$ and preserving some relevant structure, such as [[limits]].  (See also at _[[algebraic theory]]_ and _[[algebra over an algebraic theory]]_  for more on this.
