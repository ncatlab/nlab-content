## Idea

For all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ there is supposed to be a pair of [[adjoint (∞,1)-functors]] 

$$
  E_n Alg \stackrel{\overset{\mathcal{U}_n}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{}{\to}}
  L_\infty
$$

between [[E-n algebras]] and [[L-∞ algebras]], suitably factoring through [[Poisson n-algebras]].

The [[left adjoint]] $\mathcal{U}_n$ sends an [[L-∞ algebra]] to its _universal enveloping $E_n$-algebra_ in that for $n = 1$ and for $\mathfrak{g}$ an ordinary [[Lie algebra]], $\mathcal{U}_1(\mathfrak{g})$ is the [[associative algebra]] which is the ordinary [[universal enveloping algebra]] of $\mathfrak{g}$.
