## Idea

If $X$ is a [[metric space]], we can construct a version of its [[complete space|Cauchy completion]] as a [[locale]], by taking as basic opens formal symbols $B_\delta(x)$ representing [[open balls]], and imposing relations ensuring that the points are [[Cauchy filters]].  (We can equivalently regard $X$ as a [[Lawvere metric space]] and build a locale whose points are "Cauchy [[profunctors]]".)  This is the **localic completion** of $X$.

## Definition

Consider the collection of "formal balls" $B(x,\delta)$, where $x\in X$ and $\delta\in\mathbb{Q}^+$ (technically this is just another notation for the ordered pair $(x,\delta)\in X\times \mathbb{Q}^+$).  We say:

* $B(x,\delta)\le B(y,\epsilon)$ if $d(x,y)+\delta\le\epsilon$
* $B(x,\delta)\lt B(y,\epsilon)$ if $d(x,y)+\delta\lt\epsilon$

The localic completion of $X$ is the [[locale]] presented by [[generators]] $B(x,\delta)$ and relations:

1. If $B(x,\delta)\le B(y,\epsilon)$ (as above) then $B(x,\delta)\le B(y,\epsilon)$ (in the locale)
2. $\top = \bigvee_{x\in X} B(x,\epsilon)$ for any $\epsilon$
3. $B(x,\delta)\cap B(y,\epsilon) = \bigvee \{ B(z,\eta) \mid B(z,\eta) \le B(x,\delta) \text{ and } B(z,\eta) \le B(y,\epsilon) \}$
4. $B(x,\delta) = \bigvee \{ B(y,\epsilon) \mid B(y,\epsilon) \lt B(x,\delta) \}$

[Vickers](#VickersI) combines conditions (3) and (4) into:

* $B(x,\delta)\cap B(y,\epsilon) = \bigvee \{ B(z,\eta) \mid B(z,\eta) \lt B(x,\delta) \text{ and } B(z,\eta) \lt B(y,\epsilon) \}$

On the other hand, condition (3) makes sense for any poset of generators replacing $\{B(x,\delta)\}$, and simply says that we regard the generators as a [[base]] rather than a [[subbase]].  Since the elements of a [[formal topology]] automatically form a base, [Palmgren](#Palmgren) (who works with formal topologies) can omit condition (3).

When interpreted as a [[geometric theory]], conditions (1)--(4) say that the localic completion of $X$ is the [[classifying locale]] for [[Cauchy filters]] in $X$ that are additionally *rounded* (condition (4)).

## Examples

* When $X$ is the rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$, this yields the [[locale of real numbers]], which is in many respects better-behaved constructively than either its space of points (the [[Dedekind real numbers]]) or the completion of $\mathbb{Q}$ by Cauchy sequences (the [[Cauchy real numbers]]).  Thus, the localic completion provides a "good" notion of completion for arbitrary metric spaces which generalizes the good localic real numbers.

* By localically completing $\mathbb{Q}$ under a different metric, we obtain a "locale of [[p-adic numbers]]"; see [this MO question](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/214677/the-formal-p-adic-numbers).


## Generalizations

We can allow $X$ to be a [[pseudometric space]], a [[Lawvere metric space]], or even a "[[metric locale]]".  See the references.
