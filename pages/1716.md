## Idea

A _numerable open cover_ (alias _normal cover_) is an [[open cover]] of a [[topological space]] that admits a subordinate [[partition of unity]]. 

## Definition

Let $\{U_i\}$ be an open [[cover]] of the [[topological space]] $X$ (actually Dold doesn't always require open, see discussion below). It is said to be **numerable** if there is a collection of [[continuous functions]] $\phi_i \colon X \to [0,1]$ (to the [[closed interval]]) such that:

1. the [[support]] of the $i$th function is contained in the $i$th subset:

   $Supp(\phi_i) \subset U_i$;

1. at each point $x\in X$, only a [[finite number]] of the $\phi_i$ are non-zero;

1. $\underset{x \in X}{\forall}  \sum_i \phi_i(x) \equiv 1  $.

(The functions $\{\phi_i\}$ are a [[partition of unity]].)

The collection of [[preimages]] $\phi_i^{-1}(0,1]$ then constitute a [[locally finite cover]] that [[refinement|refines]] $\{U_i\}$. 



## Alternative characterizations

\begin{proposition}
([[Ernest Michael]], [[Kiiti Morita]], [[Arthur H. Stone]], see Morita \cite[Theorem 1.2]{Morita}.)                         
For an open cover $\{U_i\}_{i\in I}$ of a [[topological space]] $X$ the following properties are equivalent.                      

* $U$ is a numerable cover, i.e., it admits a compatible positive partition;

* (Michael \cite[Proposition 2]{Michael}.) $U$ admits a subordinate locally finite [[partition of unity]];

* (Stone \cite[Theorems 1 and 2]{Stone}.) $U$ is a normal cover, meaning there is a sequence $W_0=U$, $W_1$, $W_2$, … of open covers of $X$ such that $W_{n+1}$ is a [[star refinement]] of $W_n$ for all $n\ge0$;

* $U$ can be refined by the inverse image of an open cover of $Y$ under some continuous map $X\to Y$, where $Y$ is a metrizable topological space;

* (Mardešić and Segal \cite[Lemma I.6.1]{MardesicSegal}.) $U$ can be refined by the inverse image of an open cover of $Y$ under some continuous map $X\to Y$, where $Y$ is an absolute neighborhood retract, i.e., a metrizable topological space $Y$ such that any closed embedding $Y\to Z$ into a metrizable topological space $Z$ factors through an open subset $U\subset Z$ such that there is a map $U\to Y$ for which the composition $Y\to U\to Y$ is identity;

* $U$ can be refined by a locally finite normal open cover;

* $U$ can be refined by a locally finite open cover consisting of cozero sets;

* (Michael \cite[Theorem 1]{Michael}, Morita \cite[Theorem 1.2]{Morita2}.) $U$ can be refined by an open cover given by the union of a countable collection of locally finite families of cozero sets.

* (Michael \cite[Proposition 1]{Michael}, Hoshina \cite[Theorem 1.1 and 1.2]{Hoshina}.) $U$ can be refined by an open cover given by the union of a countable collection of discrete families of cozero sets.

\end{proposition}

## Properties

### As a coverage, as a site

Numerable open covers form a [[site]] called the **numerable site**. More precisely, numerable open covers are a [[coverage]] on the category [[Top]] of topological spaces (this is essentially given in [Dold's lectures, A.2.17](#DoldLectures), but not using this terminology).


For [[paracompact topological spaces]], numerable covers are [[cofinal functor|cofinal]] in open covers, so that the numerable site is equivalent to the open cover site for such spaces.

There is also a 1944 result by Dieudonnne that numerable covers are cofinal in [[locally finite open cover|locally finite covers]] of [[normal spaces]] — need to add this! See, eg, Theorem 6.3 of Howes' _Modern analysis and topology_.

### Relation to numerable bundles

Many classical theorems concerning [[fiber bundles]] are stated for the numerable site. For example, the [[classifying space]] $\mathcal{B}G$ actually classifies [[bundles]] which trivialise over a numerable cover. (References? Dold for [[Milnor's classifying space]], and tom Dieck I think for Segal's) These are called [[numerable bundles]]. This is because the standard constructions of the universal bundle by Minor and Segal both are trivialisable over a numerable cover.

talks about "stacked covers": these are useful for 'decomposing' numerable covers of products to a sort of parameterised version depending on a numerable cover of the first factor. This is important in looking at concordance of numerable bundles.
