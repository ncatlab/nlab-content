If $C$ and $D$ are monoidal categories, an **oplax monoidal functor** $F : C \to D$ is defined to be a [[lax monoidal functor]] $F: C^{op} \to D^{op}$.  So, among other things, tensor products are preseved up to morphisms of the following sort in $D$:

$$\phi_{c,c'} : F(c \otimes c') \to F(c) \otimes F(c')$$

which must satisfy a certain coherence law.

An oplax monoidal functor sends [[comonoids]] in $C$ to comonoids in $D$, just as a lax monoidal functor sends [[monoids]] in $C$ to monoids in $D$.  For this reason an oplax monoidal functor is sometimes called a **lax comonoidal functor**.  The other obvious terms, __colax monoidal__ and __lax opmonoidal__, also exist (or at least are attested on Wikipedia).

Note that a *strong* opmonoidal functor --in which the morphisms $\phi$ are required to be [[isomorphisms]]--- is the same thing as a [[strong monoidal functor]].
