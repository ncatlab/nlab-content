## Idea

Given a [[Lorentzian manifold]], then its _causal structure_ is the information at each [[tangent space]] of the subspace of [[lightlike]] tangent vectors -- the "light cones". This information distinguishes [[timelike]] from the [[spacelike]] vectors. Hence if one thinks of the [[Lorentzian manifold]] as modelling a [[spacetime]] in [[physics]], then this information encodes,  at each point, the directions along which causal influences may propagate in this spacetime.

This causal stucture is closely related to the underlying [[conformal structure]]. One may also define a concept of a _[[manifold]] with causal structure_ or _causal manifold_ without reference to a concept of Lorentian pseudo-Riemannian structure ([Bannier 88](#Bannier88), [Rainer 99](#Rainer99), [Khavkine 12](#Khavkine12)).

## In algebraic quantum field theory

In the formalization of [[quantum field theory]] in terms of [[locally covariant AQFT]] a QFT over a [[background field]] of classical [[gravity]] is axiomatized as a [[local net]] on a category of [[Lorentzian manifolds]]. Making more of the degrees of freedom of [[gravity]] become quantized themselves would mean to replace the latter with a category of manifolds with less structure than [[Lorentzian manifold]] structure. Since the causal structure is necessary to express "[[local net]]" at all, one idea is to consider local nets on a category of causal manifolds. 

This idea is mentioned as motivation for developing concepts of causal manifolds for instance in [Rainer 99](#Rainer99), and in a more sophisticated version in [Khavkine 12](#Khavkine12).
