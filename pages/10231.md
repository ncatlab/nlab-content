## Idea

Given a [[space]] of sorts, its _[[shape]]_ is a [[discrete ∞-groupoid|geometrically discrete]] [[homotopy type]] which approximates the spaces as good as possible "from the left".

For instance

* [[shape modality]] (shape of an [[object]] in a [[locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos]], see [[geometric realization in a locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos]])

* [[shape of an (∞,1)-topos]] (itself)

* [[shape of a topological space]]
