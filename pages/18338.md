An as yet rare term, but not without precedent. 

It is used---but not defined--- in [Section 1.1](#MStrickland1998), 

and one definition is proposed and discussed in 

[this MO discussion](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/139388/example-of-an-unnatural-isomorphism)

This is about formalising situations in which two structures _are_ isomorphic but it is _impossible_ to construct a [[natural isomorphism]] between them. 


One should perhaps also distinguish between an [[unnatural isomorphism]], which is an additional _structure_ added to two categories, and the _property_ of being [[unnaturally isomorphic]].

In [MathOverflow2013], M. Brandenburg recommends _pointwise isomorphic_ as a synonym, which is a more descriptive and systematic term. This should perhaps be augmented by a [[essentially pointwise isomorphic]], for _being perforce unnaturally isomorphic_.
