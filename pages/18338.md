An as yet rare term, but not without precedent. 

## Examples of the usage

The term _unnatural isomorphism_ is used---but not defined--- in Section 1.1 of [Strickland](#Strickland1998), 

and one definition is proposed and discussed in [MathOverflow2013](#MathOverflow2013).

## Idea

This is about formalising situations in which two structures _are_ isomorphic but there is no [[natural isomorphism]] between them. 

## Two meanings

One has to distinguish two meanings of _unnatural isomorphism_:

* unnatural isomorphism _of categories_

* unnatural isomorphism _of functors_

## Another distinction


One should perhaps also distinguish between an [[unnatural isomorphism]], which is an additional _structure_ added to two categories, and the _property_ of being [[unnaturally isomorphic]].

In [Brandenburg2013](#Brandenburg2013), _pointwise isomorphic_ is being recommended as a synonym, which is a more descriptive and systematic term. This should perhaps be augmented by a technical term [[essentially pointwise isomorphic]], expressing the notion of being unnaturally isomorphic _by necessity_. 


## Examples
 
#### A-forteriori-example.

Any of the isomorphisms between a vector space and its dual obtained in the usual way after choosing a basis. Here, naturality is impossible a forteriori because of unequal variances. 

#### Non-a-forteriori example . 

(cf. [Brandenburg2013](#Brandenburg2013)) Two functors from the [[interval category]], $I$, to a category $C$ are naturally isomorphic only if the morphisms they land on are isomorphic in $C$'s arrow category. But they will be unnaturally isomorphic if they land on any parallel pair of arrows.
