Term which is frequently used, informally, in mathematical discussions. 

There does not exist a standard precise meaning.

This article has both a 

* a descriptive, and 
* an analytic 

part. In the former, usages of this term as they arise in mathematical practise are described. 


The most important distinction is that _unnatural isomorphism_ is used both 

 * to refer to a perceived non-unicity of choices needed to build an isomorphism 
 * to refer to a perceived non-functoriality of some association of isomorphic objects, relative to some ambient category

This entry is _not_ about the former informal meaning, which arguably is about _size_ only (see [MO discussion](#MathOverflow2010) for a discussion of the adjective _canonical_ instead), rather focuses on the latter meaning only; more precisely: unnaturally isomorphic functors. 


There exists (e.g. [Section 3.3.1](#Yorgey2014) the usage "naturally isomorphic functors", showing awareness of the possibility of functors not being naturally isomorphic.


### Two examples of the usage

The term _unnatural isomorphism_ is used---but not defined--- in Section 1.1 of [Strickland](#Strickland1998), 

and one definition is proposed and discussed in [MathOverflow2013](#MathOverflow2013).

## Idea

Roughly, the term _unnatural isomorphism_ is born of a wish to speak about situations in which things appear very similar, but the similarity is less compelling than in other known situations. 

Two functors $F_0,F_1\colon \mathcal{C}\rightarrow\mathcal{D}$ are unnaturally isomorphic if they have similar effect in a certain sense, but $F_0$ and $F_1$ are not [[isomorphic functors]], that is, are not isomorphic objects in the [[functor category]] $[\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D}]$, equivalently, there does not exist any [[natural isomorphism]] between them. 


## Two meanings

One has to distinguish:

* unnatural isomorphism _of categories_. 

* unnatural isomorphism _of functors_.

Neither has an established precised definition. 

Moreover, many confusions in teaching and discussions arise from _isomorphic_ being a concept which is defined 

* between objects of one and the same category,

* between two categories, 

* between two functors.

### A necessary condition for two endofunctors to be unnaturally isomorphic_.


### A sufficient condition for two endofunctors to be unnaturally isomorphic_.

### Possible definitions of _unnatural isomorphism of categories_.

Any precise definition justifying the term should at least _imply_ that 

* there does not exist a [[natural isomorphism]] between the categories

It is debatable how strong the positive requirement of similarity of the categories  should be.

One possibility is to let oneself be guided by examples occurring in mathematical practice. 

## Another distinction


One should perhaps also distinguish between an [[unnatural isomorphism]], which is an additional _structure_ added to two categories, and the _property_ of being [[unnaturally isomorphic]].

In [Brandenburg2013](#Brandenburg2013), _pointwise isomorphic_ is being recommended as a synonym, which is a more descriptive and systematic term. This should perhaps be augmented by a technical term [[essentially pointwise isomorphic]], expressing the notion of being unnaturally isomorphic _by necessity_. 


## Examples
 
#### A-forteriori-examples.

Any of the isomorphisms between a vector space and its dual obtained in the usual way after choosing a basis. Here, naturality is impossible a forteriori because of unequal variances. 

#### Non-a-forteriori example . 

(cf. [this MO answer](#Brandenburg2013)) Two functors from the [[interval category]], $I$, to a category $C$ are naturally isomorphic only if the morphisms they land on are isomorphic in $C$'s arrow category. But they will be unnaturally isomorphic if they land on any parallel pair of arrows. 


### Notational remarks

 * In this article, the functors compared are invariably denoted $F_0$ and $F_1$, not $F$ and $G$, like in e.g. [MathOverflow2013](#MathOverflow2013) and in many other treatments involving pairs of functors, for one main reason: there is a long tradition of denoting functors _in opposite directions_ by $F$ and $G$, especially in discussions of adjunctions, but this is not what this article is about.
