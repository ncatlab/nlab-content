Term which is frequently used, informally, in mathematical discussions. 

There does not exist a standard precise meaning.


The most important distinction is that _unnatural isomorphism_ is used both 

 * to refer to a perceived non-unicity of choices needed to build an isomorphism,
 * to refer to a perceived non-functoriality of some association of isomorphic objects, relative to some ambient category.

This article is _not_ about the former informal meaning, which arguably is about _size_ only (see [MO discussion](#MathOverflow2010) for a discussion of the adjective _canonical_ instead), rather focuses on the latter meaning only; more precisely: unnaturally isomorphic functors. 


Caution: this article is _under construction_, please use with care.



This article has both a 

* a descriptive, and 
* an analytic 

part. 

In the former, usages of this term as they arise in mathematical practise are described.

## Idea

Roughly, the term _unnatural isomorphism_ is born of a wish to speak about situations in which things appear very similar, but the similarity is less compelling than in other known situations. Category theory is useful in analysing and systematizing the underlying reasons. Understanding situations of unnatural isomorphism can help to better appreciate [[natural isomorphism]]s, in particular, to appreciate that---contrary to what the adjective _natural_ may suggest---many isomorphisms that occur in nature are in fact _not_ natural in the technical sense, the latter therefore being particularly valuable structures.




## Nomenclature 

The term _unnatural_ is not to be taken in an judgemental sense, nor as suggesting this kind of isomorphism would occur _rarely_: the term is rather modelled on the standard term [[natural isomorphism]], which in turn is used for traditional reasons, cf. [EilenbergMac Lane45](#EilenbergMacLane45)


One can distinguish between _an_ unnatural isomorphism, which is an additional _structure_ added to two functors, and _being_ unnaturally isomorphic, which is a property that a pair of functors may or may not have.

In [Brandenburg2013](#Brandenburg2013), _pointwise isomorphic_ is being recommended as a synonym, which is indeed a more descriptive, neutral and systematic term. 
Another alternative term would be _statically isomorphic_: intuitively, two functors are unnaturally isomorphic they always (produce things which) look isomorphic---as long as you do not move in the source-category.



Two functors $F_0,F_1\colon \mathcal{C}\rightarrow\mathcal{D}$ are unnaturally isomorphic if they have similar effect in a certain sense, but $F_0$ and $F_1$ are not [[isomorphic functors]], that is, are not isomorphic objects in the [[functor category]] $[\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D}]$, equivalently, there does not exist any [[natural isomorphism]] between them. 
### Descriptions of the usage

#### Non-example 

A kind of _non_-example is the use of the term _unnatural isomorphism_ in Section 1.1 of [Strickland](#Strickland1998); there, the author presumably refers to nothing else than that there are as many isomorphisms between two finite fields of the same cardinality as there are field automorphisms of a finite field of that size, none of them meaningfully distinguished.
This is the use of _unnatural_ as a synonym for _non-canonical_, which this article is _not_ about. 


#### Examples.  


##### An indirect example 

There is a widespread usage "naturally isomorphic functors", somewhat pleonastic since [[isomorphic functors]] are usually assumed to be naturally isomorphic by default. This shows an awareness of, and a wish to guard against. the possibility of functors not being naturally isomorphic.


##### A mathematical discussion

The term is discussed, and a definition proposed, in [MathOverflow2013](#MathOverflow2013).


#### A widespread usage

The term _unnatural isomorphism_ is often used in [[homological algebra]], in particular in discussions of splittings. An example is [Theorem 4.3](#HiltonStammbach71), which explictly uses the term to decribe an isomorphism between Hom- and Ext-functors.

##### A recent definition 

Species are functors for which unnatural isomorphisms are often discussed. For example, [Definition 3.3.4](#Yorgey2014) defines an equivalence relation on the class of all species by explicitly using the term, defining an "equipotence between species [...] as an "unnatural" isomorphism between [the two species in question]", however, in _another_ sense, which will not be spelled out here, than discussed in  [MathOverflow2013](#MathOverflow2013).

## DIfferent meanings

Many confusions in teaching and discussions appear to arise from the bare word_isomorphic_ being defined 

* between objects of one and the same category,

* between two categories, 

* between two functors.

Moreover, at the face of it, discussions of unnatural isomorphisms are often about two _objects_ of a given category, such as in discussions of some vector space $V$ being unnaturally isomorphic to its dual $V^\ast$. 
This makes it seems as if there is a concept of unnaturally isomorphic _objects_; in the following sense, unnaturally (or naturally, for that matter) _objects_ are a meaningless concept: 

* on the elementary logical level, the language of 1-categories has but _one_ [[sort]] of _variables_ interpreted as morphisms.

While, in a sense, there are "derived" sorts (such as [[epi]], [[mono]] and [[iso]]) of morphisms, defined by first-order formulas in the language of 1-category theory, a definition of _unnatural_ isomorphism in a category, formally speaking, does simply _not_ exist.

#### The minimal example

#### The vector-space-dual-example

Arguably, this is the most well known example.
In a sense, this a doubly-unnatural isomorphism: there is both an issue of non-canonicity and of non-functoriality, ther latter failing for a particularly strong reasons: unequal variances.

### Notational remarks

 * In this article, the functors compared are invariably denoted $F_0$ and $F_1$, not $F$ and $G$, like in e.g. [MathOverflow2013](#MathOverflow2013) and in many other treatments involving pairs of functors, for one main reason: there is a long tradition of denoting functors _in opposite directions_ by $F$ and $G$, especially in discussions of adjunctions, but this is not what this article is about.
