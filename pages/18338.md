An as yet rare term, but not without precedent. 

It is used---but not defined--- in [Section 1.1](#MStrickland1998), 

and one definition is proposed and discussed in 

[this MO discussion](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/139388/example-of-an-unnatural-isomorphism)

This is about formalising situations in which two structures _are_ isomorphic but there is no [[natural isomorphism]] between them. 


One should perhaps also distinguish between an [[unnatural isomorphism]], which is an additional _structure_ added to two categories, and the _property_ of being [[unnaturally isomorphic]].

In [MathOverflow2013], M. Brandenburg recommends _pointwise isomorphic_ as a synonym, which is a more descriptive and systematic term. This should perhaps be augmented by a [[essentially pointwise isomorphic]], for _being perforce unnaturally isomorphic_. 


## Examples
 
#### A-forteriori-example.

Any of the isomorphisms between a vector space and its dual obtained in the usual way after choosing a basis. Here, naturality is impossible a forteriori because of unequal variances. 

#### Non-a-forteriori example . 

(cf. [Brandenburg2013](#Brandenburg2013)) for most categories $\mathsf{C}$, 
the [[functor category]] $\mathsf{C}^{\circ\rightarrow\circ}$ is unnaturally isomorphic to the [[arrow category]] $\mathsf{C}^{\rightarrow}$.
