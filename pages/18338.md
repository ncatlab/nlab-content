Rare term, not without precedent. 

## Examples of the usage

The term _unnatural isomorphism_ is used---but not defined--- in Section 1.1 of [Strickland](#Strickland1998), 

and one definition is proposed and discussed in [MathOverflow2013](#MathOverflow2013).

## Idea

This is about formalising situations in which two structures _are_ isomorphic but there is no [[natural isomorphism]] between them. 

## Two meanings

One has to distinguish:

* unnatural isomorphism _of categories_. 

* unnatural isomorphism _of functors_.

Neither has an established precised definition. 

Moreover, many confusions in teaching and discussions arise from _isomorphic_ being a concept which is defined 

* between objects of one and the same category,

* between two categories, 

* between two functors.

### Possible definitions of _unnatural isomorphism of categories_.

Any precise definition justifying the term should at least _imply_ that 

* there does not exist a [[natural isomorphism]] between the categories

It is debatable how strong the positive requirement of similarity of the categories  should be.

One possibility is to let oneself be guided by examples occurring in mathematical practice. 

## Another distinction


One should perhaps also distinguish between an [[unnatural isomorphism]], which is an additional _structure_ added to two categories, and the _property_ of being [[unnaturally isomorphic]].

In [Brandenburg2013](#Brandenburg2013), _pointwise isomorphic_ is being recommended as a synonym, which is a more descriptive and systematic term. This should perhaps be augmented by a technical term [[essentially pointwise isomorphic]], expressing the notion of being unnaturally isomorphic _by necessity_. 


## Examples
 
#### A-forteriori-examples.

Any of the isomorphisms between a vector space and its dual obtained in the usual way after choosing a basis. Here, naturality is impossible a forteriori because of unequal variances. 

#### Non-a-forteriori example . 

(cf. [Brandenburg2013](#Brandenburg2013)) Two functors from the [[interval category]], $I$, to a category $C$ are naturally isomorphic only if the morphisms they land on are isomorphic in $C$'s arrow category. But they will be unnaturally isomorphic if they land on any parallel pair of arrows.
