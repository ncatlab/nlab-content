## Idea


A _bigraded object_ is a [[graded object]] of [[graded objects]].

## Examples

* The terms in a [[filtered chain complex]].

* The terms in a [[double complex]].

* The terms of an [[exact couple]].

* The terms on any one page of a [[spectral sequence]] (as one ranges over the pages, it is even triply graded).
