## Idea

A [[categorification]] of the [[2-category]] of [[Clifford algebras]] and [[bimodules]] between them. The "2-Clifford algebra" objects are [[spinning string]] theories, modeled as fermionic [[conformal nets]].

This is supposedly related to the [[String 2-group]] and [[superstrings]] as Clifford algebras are related to the [[spin group]] and [[spinning particles]].

(...)

## References

A somewhat novel take on fermionic [[conformal nets]] is presented and studied in 

* [[Arthur Bartels]], [[Chris Douglas]], [[Andre Henriques]], _Conformal nets and local field theory_ ([arXiv:0912.5307](http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.5307))

* [[Arthur Bartels]], [[Chris Douglas]], [[Andre Henriques]], _Conformal nets I: coordinate-free nets_ ([arXiv:1302.2604](http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.2604))

where fermionic conformal nets are arranged into a [[tricategory]]  with [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal structure]] that is a [[delooping]] of the [[bicategory]] of [[von Neumann algebra]]s and [[bimodule]]s between these. Among other things, this work connects the [[AQFT]] notion of conformal nets with the [[FQFT]] notion of [[cobordism]] representations.
