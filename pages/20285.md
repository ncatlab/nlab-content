### Properties ###

* [[second-countable space|second-countable]]: there is a [[countable set|countable]] [[topological base|base]] of the topology.

* [[metrisable topological space|metrisable]]: the topology is induced by a metric.

* $\sigma$-locally discrete base: the topology of $X$ is generated by a [[countably locally discrete set of subsets|$\sigma$-locally discrete]] [[topological base|base]].

* $\sigma$-locally finite base: the topology of $X$ is generated by a [[countably locally finite set of subsets|countably locally finite]] [[topological base|base]].

* [[separable space|separable]]: there is a countable [[dense subspace|dense]] subset.

* [[Lindelöf topological space|Lindelöf]]: every [[open cover]] has a [[countable cover|countable]] sub-cover.

* [[weakly Lindelöf topological space|weakly Lindelöf]]: every [[open cover]] has a [[countable set|countable]] subcollection the union of which is dense.

* [[countable choice]]: the [[natural number|natural numbers]] are a [[projective object]] in [[Set]].

* [[metacompact space|metacompact]]: every open cover has a point-finite open refinement.


* [[countable chain condition]]: A family of pairwise disjoint open subsets is at most countable.

* [[first-countable space|first-countable]]: every point has a countable [[neighborhood base]]

* [[Frechet-Uryson space]]: the closure of a set $A$ consists precisely of all limit points of sequences in $A$

* [[sequential topological space]]: a set $A$ is closed if it contains all limit points of sequences in $A$

* [[countably tight space|countably tight]]: for each subset $A$ and each point $x\in \overline A$ there is a countable subset $D\subseteq A$ such that $x\in \overline D$.


### Implications ###

* [[open covers of metric spaces have open countably locally discrete refinements|a metric space has a $\sigma$-locally discrete base]]

* [[Nagata-Smirnov metrization theorem]]

* a second-countable space has a [[countably locally finite set of subsets|$\sigma$-locally finite]] [[topological base|base]]:  take the the collection of singeltons of all elements of countable cover of $X$. 

* second-countable spaces are separable: use the axiom of [[countable choice]] to choose a point in each set of countable cover.

* [[second-countable spaces are Lindelöf]].

* [[weakly Lindelöf spaces with countably locally finite base are second countable]].

* [[separable metacompact spaces are Lindelöf]].

* separable spaces satisfy the countable chain condition: given a dense set $D$ and a family $\{U_\alpha : \alpha \in A\}$, the map $D \to A$ assigning $d$ to the unique $\alpha \in A$ with $d \in U_\alpha$ is surjective.

* separable spaces are weakly Lindelöf: given a countable dense subset and an open cover [[axiom of choice|choose]] for each point of the subset an open from the cover.

* Lindelöf spaces are trivially also weakly Lindelöf.

* a space with a $\sigma$-locally finite base is first countable: obviously, every point is contained in at most countably many sets of a $\sigma$-locally finite base.

* a first-countable space is obviously Fréchet-Urysohn.

* a Fréchet-Uryson space is obviously sequential.

* a sequential space is obviously countably tight.
