## Definition

A **simplicial ring** is a [[simplicial object]] in the [[category]] [[Ring]] of [[ring]]s.

## Modules over simplicial rings

There is an evident notion of [[(infinity,1)-category]] of [[module]]s over a simplicial ring. The corresponding [[bifibration]] $SMod \to SRing$ of modules over simplicial ring has the remarkable property that it is equivalently to that [[tangent (infinity,1)-category]] of the [[(infinity,1)-category]] of simplicial rings.

## In higher geometry

Simplicial rings are one notion of [[vertical categorification]] of [[rings]], another generalizations are [[E-infinity-ring]]s. As such, simplicial rings come with their notion of [[higher geometry]], in particular their notion of [[derived scheme]]s, [[derived stack]]s and [[quasicoherent sheaf|quasicogerent sheaves]]. An application of this appears for instance in [[geometric infinity-function theory]].
