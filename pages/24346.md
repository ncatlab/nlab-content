## Idea

A [[Grothendieck topology]] is "completely decomposable" if it is generated by [[covering families]] consisting of [[pairs]] of maps which are part of a distinguished [[commuting square]]. The collection of these distinguished squares is then called a "cd-structure".

The [[descent]]-condition for [[simplicial presheaves]] (their [[infinity-stack|$\infty$-stack]]-condition) over completely decomposable topologies may be expressed by a [[Brown-Gersten property]].
