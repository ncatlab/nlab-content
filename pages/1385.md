Recall that a [[presentable (infinity,1)-category]] is a [[localization]] of a [[(infinity,1)-category of (infinity,1)-presheaves]]. In particular it has all small [[colimit]]s. An [[(infinity,1)-functor]] $C \times D \to E$ from the cartesian product of two presentable $(\infty,1)$-categories is _bilinear_ if it respects colimits in both variables.

It turns out that there is a _universal_ such bilinear functor

$$
  C \times D \to C \otimes D
  \,,
$$

which thereby defines a [[tensor product]] of presentable $(\infty,1)$-categories. This defines a [[monoidal (infinity,1)-category|monoidal structure]] on presentable $(\infty,1)$-categories, which is in fact [[symmetric monoidal (infinity,1)-category|symmetric]]. 

The collection of presentable $(\infty,1)$-cateories with colimit-preserving [[(infinity,1)-functor]]s between them (i.e. with "*linear*" functors between them!), called

$$
  Pr^L
,$$

is an $(\infty,1)$-generalization of the category $Set Mod$ of ordinary categories and bimodules or profunctors, or distributors between them. See [[distributor]] and in particular the discussion there about the equivalent reformulation in terms of colimit-preserving functors.

Using $Pr^L$ with its notion of "linearity" one obtains a very general notion of $\infty$-linear algebra. This is described at [[geometric infinity-function theory]].

#Definition#

Write $Pr(\infty,1)Cat_1^L$ for the sub-$(\infty,1)$-category of the [[(infinity,1)-category of (infinity,1)-categories]] whose

* objects are [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presentable (infinity,1)-categories]];

* morphisms are colimit-preserving [[(infinity,1)-functor]]s.

With $C \times D \to C \otimes D$ the tensor product obtainmed as the universal colimit-preserving functor, $Pr(\infty,1)Cat_1^L$ becomes a [[symmetric monoidal (infinity,1)-category]].


#Stable version#

The symmetric monoidal structure on presentable $(\infty,1)$-categories restricts to one on presentable [[stable (infinity,1)-category|stable (infinity,1)-categories]].

The tensor unit of stable presentable $(\infty,1)$-categories is the [[stable (infinity,1)-category of spectra]].
