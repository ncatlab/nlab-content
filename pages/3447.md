## Idea

Recall that a [[locally constant sheaf]] (of sets) is a section of the [[constant stack]] with fiber the [[groupoid]] $Core(FinSet)$, the [[core]] of the [[category]] [[FinSet]].

This extends to a general pattern:

a **locally constant $\infty$-stack** is a section of the [[constant ∞-stack]] that is constant on the [[∞-groupoid]] $Core(\infty FinGrpd)$.

## Definition

We propose a definition of locally constant $\infty$-stacks inside any [[(∞,1)-topos]].



Let $C$ be some [[site]] and let $\mathbf{H} = Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C)$ be the [[(∞,1)-topos]] of [[∞-stack]]s over $C$. We think of objects $X \in \mathbf{H}$ as generalized [[space]]s modeled on $C$.

We have a squence of [[adjunction]]s

$$
  Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C)
  \stackrel{\overset{L}{\leftarrow}}{\hookrightarrow}
  PSh_{(\infty,1)}(C)
  \stackrel{\overset{const}{\leftarrow}}{\to}
  PSh_{(\infty,1)}(*)
  =
  \infty Grpd 
  :
  LConst
$$

where on the left we have the defining adjunction of the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves]] -- $L$ is [[∞-stackification]] -- and on the right the [[geometric morphism]] that is induced from the canonical morphism of [[site]]s $C \to {*}$ (to the [[terminal object|terminal]] site).



Let 

$$
  \infty FinBund := LConst(Core(Fin \infty Grpd)) \in \mathbf{H}
$$

be the [[constant ∞-stack]] that is constant on the [[∞-groupoid]] which is the [[core]] of the [[(∞,1)-category]] of _finite_ [[∞-groupoid]]s. We think of this as the **$\infty$-stack of $\infty$-bundles with finite fibers** -- the generalization of the notion of [[covering space]] to the context $\mathbf{H}$. 

This is naturally a [[pointed object]] with point

$$
  ({*} \to \infty FinBund) \;:=\; LConst({*} \to Core(\infty FinGrpd))
$$

the [[∞-stackification]] of the inclusion of constant [[(∞,1)-presheaf|∞-presheaves]] induced from the canonical inclusion ${*} \hookrightarrow $ [[∞Grpd]], identifying the terminal [[∞-groupoid]].

For $X \in \mathbf{H}$ any object, the following terminology is suggestive:

* the $\infty FinBund$-[[principal ∞-bundle]] 
  [[homotopy fiber|classified by]] a [[cocycle]] $X \to \infty FinBund$ 
  is a **covering $\infty$-bundle** of $X$;

* the [[∞-groupoid]]

  $$
    \infty FinBund(X) := \mathbf{H}(X,\infty FinBund)
  $$

  is the $\infty$-groupoid of covering $\infty$-bundles on $X$;

* hence the [[cohomology]] $H(X,\infty FinBund) = \pi_0\mathbf{H}(X,\infty FinBund)$ is the set of equivalence classes of covering $\infty$-bundles of $X$.

If the [[left adjoint]] $LConst$ is also a [[right adjoint]]

$$
  Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C)
  \stackrel{\overset{LConst}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Pi}{\to}}
  \infty Grpd   
$$

then we have

$$
  \infty FinBund(X) \simeq Func(\Pi(X),\infty FinGrpd)
  \,.
$$

This may be used to define the [[geometric homotopy groups in an (∞,1)-topos]].

## Examples {#References}

Here are commented references that establish aspects of the above general abstract situation.


### Locally constant 1-stacks and 2-stacks on topological spaces

A discussion of locally constant 2-stacks over topological spaces is in

* [[Pietro Polesello]] and [[Ingo Waschkies]], _Higher monodromy_ , Homology, Homotopy and Applications, Vol. 7(2005), No. 1, pp. 109-150 ([pdf](http://www.intlpress.com/HHA/v7/n1/a7/pdf)).

We indicate briefly how the results stated in this article fit into the general abstract picture as indicated above:

The authors consider locally constant 1-stacks and 2-stacks on sites of open subsets of [[topological space]]s.

Prop. 1.1.9 gives the [[adjunction]]

$$
  (LConst \dashv \Gamma) : Sh_{(2,1)}(X) \stackrel{\overset{LConst}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma}{\to}} Grpd
$$

between forming constant stacks and taking global sections.

Then prop 1.2.5, 1.2.6, culminating in 
[theorem 1.2.9, p. 121](http://www.intlpress.com/HHA/v7/n1/a7/v7n1a7.pdf#page=13) gives (somewhat implicitly) the other adjunction

$$
  (\Pi_1\dashv LConst) : Op(X) \hookrightarrow Sh_{(2,1)}(X) \stackrel{\overset{LConst}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Pi_1}{\to}} Grpd
$$

with the [[right adjoint]] to $LConst$ being the [[fundamental groupoid]] functor on representables. (Where we change a bit the perspective on the results as presented there, to amplify the pattern indicated above. For instance where the authors write $\Gamma(X,C_X)$ we think of this here equivalently as $Sh_{(2,1)}(X)(X,LConst(C))$, so that the theorem then gives the adjunction equivalence $\cdots \simeq Grpd(\Pi_1(X),C)$).

Then in essentially verbatim analogy, these results are lifted from stacks to 2-stacks in section 2, where now prop 2.2.2, 2.2.3, culminating in [theorem 2.2.5, p. 132](http://www.intlpress.com/HHA/v7/n1/a7/v7n1a7.pdf#page=24) gives (somewhat implicitly) the adjunction

$$
  (\Pi_2\dashv LConst) : Op(X) \hookrightarrow Sh_{(3,1)}(X) \stackrel{\overset{LConst}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Pi_2}{\to}} Grpd
$$

now with the [[path n-groupoid|path 2-groupoid]] operation (locally) left adjoint to forming constant 2-stacks. (Subjct verbatim to a remark as above.)


### Locally constant $\infty$-stacks on topological spaces {#ooStackOnTopSpace}


A discussion of locally constant $\infty$-stacks over [[topological space]]s is in

* [[Bertrand Toen]], _Toward a Galoisian interpretation of homotopy theory_ ([arXiv:0007157](http://arxiv1.library.cornell.edu/abs/math/0007157))

In [theorem 2.13, p. 25](http://arxiv1.library.cornell.edu/PS_cache/math/pdf/0007/0007157v4.pdf#page=25) the author proves an equivalence of [[(∞,1)-categories]] (modeled there as [[Segal category|Segal categories]])

$$
  LConst(X) \simeq Fib(\Pi(X))
$$

of [[locally constant ∞-stack]]s on $X$ and [[Kan fibration]]s over the [[fundamental ∞-groupoid]] $\Pi(X) = Sing(X)$.

But by the right Quillen functor $Id : sSet_{Quillen} \to sSet_{Joyal}$ from the Quillen [[model structure on simplicial sets]] to the [[Joyal model structure on simplicial sets]] every Kan fibration is a categorical fibration and every categorical fibration over a [[Kan complex]] is a [[Cartesian fibration]] (as discussed there) and a coCartesian fibration. Finally, by the [[Grothendieck construction|(∞,1)-Grothendieck construction]], these are equivalent to [[(∞,1)-functor]]s $\Pi(X) \to \infty Grpd$.

In total this means that via the [[Grothendieck construction]] To&euml;n's result does actually produce an equivalence

$$
  LConst(X) \simeq Func(\Pi(X), \infty Grpd)
  \,.
$$

## Pattern

* A [[locally constant function]] is a section of a [[constant sheaf]];

* a [[locally constant sheaf]] is a section of a [[constant stack]];

* a [[locally constant stack]] is a section of (... and so on...)

* a **locally constant $\infty$-stack** is a section of a [[constant ∞-stack]].

A locally constant sheaf / $\infty$-stack is also called a [[local system]].
