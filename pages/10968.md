The original representability theorem: every [[fully faithful]] [[triangulated functor]] between the [[derived categories]] of [[perfect complexes]] on two [[smooth]] [[projective varieties]] is representable by some [[integral kernel]] (i.e. is a [[Fourier-Mukai functor]]).

If a [[smooth]] [[projective variety]] has the property that its [[canonical sheaf]] is [[ample]] or anti-ample, then one may reconstruct it up to isomorphism from its bounded [[derived category]] of [[coherent sheaves]].

* [[Bertrand Toen]], _Homotopy theory of dg-categories and derived Morita theory_, 2004, [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0408337)

The [[homotopy category]] of the [[model category]] of [[dg-categories]], where [[weak equivalences]] are quasi-equivalences, is studied.  It is shown to admit [[internal homs]] and the morphism sets are in bijection with right quasi-representable [[bimodules]].  Among other applications is a dg-version of Orlov's representability theorem: it is shown that morphisms between the [[dg-categories]] of [[perfect complexes]] on [[smooth]] [[proper schemes]] are in bijection with [[perfect complexes]] on the product.  An analogous statement for [[quasi-coherent complexes]] is also shown.

The [[Chow motive]] of a [[smooth]] [[projective variety]] may be reconstructed up to [[Tate twists]] from the bounded [[derived category]] of [[coherent sheaves]].

Uniqueness results are established for [[dg-enhancements]] of [[triangulated categories]].  In particular the results are applied to the [[derived categories]] of [[perfect complexes]], [[coherent sheaves]], [[quasi-coherent sheaves]], on schemes.  This is then used to deduce from (Toen 2004) representability theorems on the level of [[triangulated categories]], in the non-smooth case.

Describes how to glue two [[dg-categories]] in such a way that the [[homotopy category]] of the result has a [[semiorthogonal decomposition]] into two components, which are the respective [[homotopy categories]] of the original [[dg-categories]].

If an [[admissible subcategory]] of the bounded [[derived category]] of [[coherent sheaves]] on a [[smooth]] [[projective variety]] is a [[phantom]], has vanishing [[Hochschild homology]] and [[Grothendieck group]], then its [[noncommutative motive]] vanishes.  In particular its higher [[K-theory]] also vanishes.
