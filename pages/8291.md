## Definition

For $R$ a [[ring]], let $R$[[Mod]] be the category of $R$-[[modules]].

An **injective module** over $R$ is an [[injective object]] in $R Mod$. 

This is the dual notion of a _[[projective module]]_. 

## Properties

### Equivalent characterizations

Let $R$ be a [[commutative ring]] and  $C = R Mod$ the category of $R$-[[modules]]. We discuss [[injective modules]] over $R$ (see there for more).

###### Proposition 
**([[Baer's criterion]])**


If the [[axiom of choice]] holds, 
then a [[module]] $Q \in R Mod$ is an [[injective module]] precisely if for $I$ any left $R$-[[ideal]] regarded as an $R$-module, any [[homomorphism]] $g : I \to Q$ in $C$ can be extended to all of $R$ along the inclusion $I \hookrightarrow R$.

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Sketch of proof 

Let $i \colon M \hookrightarrow N$ be a [[monomorphism]] in $R Mod$, and let $f \colon M \to Q$ be a map. We must extend $f$ to a map $h \colon N \to Q$. Consider the [[poset]] whose elements are pairs $(M', f')$ where $M'$ is an intermediate [[submodule]] between $M$ and $N$ and $f' \colon M' \to Q$ is an extension of $f$, ordered by $(M', f') \leq (M'', f'')$ if $M''$ contains $M'$ and $f''$ extends $f'$. By an application of [[Zorn's lemma]], this poset has a [[maximal element]], say $(M', f')$. Suppose $M'$ is not all of $N$, and let $x \in N$ be an element not in $M'$; we show that $f'$ extends to a map $M'' = \langle x \rangle + M' \to Q$, a [[contradiction]]. 

The set $\{r \in R: r x \in M'\}$ is an ideal $I$ of $R$, and we have a module [[homomorphism]] $g \colon I \to Q$ defined by $g(r) = f'(r x)$. By [[hypothesis]], we may extend $g$ to a module map $k \colon R \to Q$. Writing a general element of $M''$ as $r x + y$ where $y \in M'$, it may be shown that 

$$f''(r x + y) = k(r) + g(y)$$ 

is well-defined and extends $f'$, as desired.

###### Corollary
{#DirectSumInjectives} 

Assume that the [[axiom of choice]] holds.

Let $R$ be a [[Noetherian ring]], and let $\{Q_j\}_{j \in J}$ be a collection of [[injective modules]] over $R$. Then the [[direct sum]] $Q = \bigoplus_{j \in J} Q_j$ is also injective. 

=-- 

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof 

By [Baer's criterion](#Baer), it suffices to show that for any [[ideal]] $I$ of $R$, a module [[homomorphism]] $f \colon I \to Q$ extends to a map $R \to Q$. Since $R$ is Noetherian, $I$ is [[finitely generated module|finitely generated]] as an $R$-module, say by elements $x_1, \ldots, x_n$. Let $p_j \colon Q \to Q_j$ be the [[projection]], and put $f_j = p_j \circ f$. Then for each $x_i$, $f_j(x_i)$ is nonzero for only finitely many summands. Taking all of these summands together over all $i$, we see that $f$ factors through 

$$\prod_{j \in J'} Q_j = \bigoplus_{j \in J'} Q_j \hookrightarrow Q$$ 

for some finite $J' \subset J$. But a [[product]] of injectives is injective, hence $f$ extends to a map $R \to \prod_{j \in J'} Q_j$, which completes the proof.

###### Proposition

Conversely, $R$ is a [[Noetherian ring]] if [[direct sums]] of injective $R$-[[modules]] are injective.

### Existence of enough injectives
 {#ExistenceOfEnoughInjectives}

We discuss that in the presence of the [[axiom of choice]] at least, the category $R$[[Mod]] has _[[injective object|enough injectives]]_ in that every module is a [[submodule]] of an injective one. We first consider this for $R = \mathbb{Z}$. We do assume prop. \ref{InjectiveAbelianGroupIsDivisibleGroup}, which may be proven using [[Baer's criterion]]. 

+-- {: .num_prop #AbHasEnoughInjectives}
###### Proposition

Assuming the [[axiom of choice]],
the [[category]] $\mathbb{Z}$[[Mod]] $\simeq$ [[Ab]] has [[injective object|enough injectives]].

=--

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 

By prop. \ref{InjectiveAbelianGroupIsDivisibleGroup} an [[abelian group]]
is an injective $\mathbb{Z}$-module precisely if it is a [[divisible group]]. So we need to show that every [[abelian group]] is a [[subgroup]] of a [[divisible group]].

To start with, notice that the group $\mathbb{Q}$ of [[rational numbers]] is divisible and hence the canonical embedding $\mathbb{Z} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{Q}$ shows that the additive group of [[integers]] embeds into an injective $\mathbb{Z}$-module.

Now by the discussion at _[[projective module]]_ every [[abelian group]] $A$ receives an [[epimorphism]] $(\oplus_{s \in S} \mathbb{Z}) \to A$ from a [[free group|free]] abelian group, hence is the [[quotient group]] of a [[direct sum]] of copies of $\mathbb{Z}$. Accordingly it embeds into a quotient $\tilde A$ of a direct sum of copies of $\mathbb{Q}$.

$$
  \array{
    ker &\stackrel{=}{\to}& ker 
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    (\oplus_{s \in S} \mathbb{Z}) &\hookrightarrow& (\oplus_{s \in S} \mathbb{Q})
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    A &\hookrightarrow& \tilde A
  }
$$

Here $\tilde A$ is divisible because the [[direct sum]] of divisible groups is again divisible, and also the [[quotient group]] of a divisible groups is again divisble. So this exhibits an embedding of any $A$ into a divisible abelian group, hence into an injective $\mathbb{Z}$-module.

###### Proposition

Assuming the [[axiom of choice]],
for $R$ a [[ring]], the category $R$[[Mod]] has [[injective object|enough injectives]].

=--

The proof uses the following lemma.

Write $U\colon R Mod \to Ab$ for the [[forgetful functor]] that forgets the $R$-module structure on a module $N$ and just remembers the underlying abelian group $U(N)$. 

+-- {: .num_lemma #CoextensionOfScalarsForRModToZMod}
###### Lemma

The [[functor]] $U\colon R Mod \to Ab$ has a [[right adjoint]] 

$$
  R_* : Ab \to R Mod
$$

given by sending an [[abelian group]] $A$ to the abelian group

$$
  U(R_*(A)) \coloneqq Ab(U(R),A)
$$

equipped with the $R$-[[module]] struture by which for $r \in R$ an element $(U(R) \stackrel{f}{\to} A) \in U(R_*(A))$ is sent to the element $r f$ given by

$$
  r f : r' \mapsto f(r' \cdot r)
  \,.
$$ 

This is called the **[[coextension of scalars]]** along the ring homomorphism $\mathbb{Z} \to R$.

The [[unit of an adjunction|unit]] of the $(U \dash R_*)$ [[adjunction]]

$$
  \epsilon_N : N \to R_*(U(N))
$$

is the $R$-module homomorphism

$$
  \epsilon_N : N \to Hom_{Ab}(U(R), U(N))
$$

given on $n \in N$ by

$$
  j(n) : r \mapsto r n
  \,.
$$

=--

+-- {: .proof} 
###### Proof 
**of prop. \ref{ModEnoughInjectives}**

Let $N \in R Mod$. We need to find a monomorphism $N \to \tilde N$ such that $\tilde N$ is an injective $R$-module.


By prop. \ref{AbHasEnoughInjectives} there exists a monomorphism

$$
  i \colon U(N) \hookrightarrow D
$$

of the underlying abelian group into an injective abelian group $D$.


Now consider the [[adjunct]] $N \to R_*(D)$ of $i$, hence the composite

$$
  N \stackrel{\eta_N}{\to} R_*(U(N)) \stackrel{R_*(i)}{\to} R_*(D)
$$

with $R_*$ and $\eta_N$ from lemma \ref{CoextensionOfScalarsForRModToZMod}. On the underlying abelian groups this is

$$
  U(N) \stackrel{U(\eta_N)}{\to} Hom_{Ab}(U(R), U(N)) \stackrel{Hom_{Ab}(U(R),i)}{\to}
  Hom_{Ab}(U(R),U(D))
  \,.
$$

Once checks on components that this is a [[monomorphism]]. Therefore it is now sufficient to see that $Hom_{Ab}(U(R), U(D))$ is an injective $R$-module.

This follows from the existence of the [[adjunction]] [[isomorphism]] given by lemma \ref{CoextensionOfScalarsForRModToZMod}

$$
  Hom_{Ab}(U(K),U(D))
  \simeq
  Hom_{R Mod}(K, Hom_{Ab}(U(R), U(D)))
$$

[[natural isomorphism|natural]] in $K \in R Mod$ and from the injectivity of $D \in Ab$. 

$$
  \array{
      U(K) &\to& D
      \\
      \downarrow & \nearrow
      \\
      U(L)
  }
  \;\;\;\;\;
  \leftrightarrow
  \;\;\;\;\;
  \array{
      K &\to& R_*D
      \\
      \downarrow & \nearrow
      \\
      L
  }
  \,.

By prop. \ref{InjectiveAbelianGroupIsDivisibleGroup} the following [[abelian groups]] are injective in [[Ab]].

The group of [[rational numbers]] $\mathbb{Q}$ is injective in [[Ab]], as is the additive group of [[real numbers]] $\mathbb{R}$ and generally that underlying any [[field]]. The additive group underlying any [[vector space]] is injective. The [[quotient]] of any injective group by any other group is injective.
