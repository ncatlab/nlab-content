## Idea ## 

An [[abelian group]] where one could halve each element or divide each element by two. 

## Definition ##

A **halving group** is an [[abelian group]] *G* with a function $(-)/2:G \to G$ called **halving** or **dividing by two** such that for all $g \in G$, $g/2 + g/2 = g$. 

## Properties

* Just as every abelian group is a $\mathbb{Z}$-[[module]], every halving group is a $\mathbb{D}$-[[module]], where $\mathbb{D}$ are the [[dyadic rational numbers]]. 

* The only element of a halving group with [[order of a group|order]] $2$ is the additive unit $0$.
