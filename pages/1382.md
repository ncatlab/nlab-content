An __$E_\infty$-ring__ is a [[commutative monoid in an (∞,1)-category|commutative monoid]] in the [[stable (∞,1)-category of spectra]]. Sometimes this is called a [[commutative ring spectrum]]. An [[E-∞ algebra]] in [[spectra]].

This means that an $E_\infty$-ring is an [[A-∞ ring]] that is commutative up to coherent higher homotopies.

Equivalently $E_\infty$-rings may be modeled as ordinary commutative [[monoids]] with respect to the [[symmetric monoidal smash product of spectra]].

$E_\infty$-rings are the analoge in [[higher algebra]] of the commutative [[rings]] in ordinary [[algebra]].
