**$E_\infty$-ring** is a commutative [[A-infinity ring]]: another term for [[commutative ring spectrum]].

Is this term usually defined differently or used in a different context, or should we redirect?

[[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]: I am not sure. The good answer to this might depend on a similar question which I have at [[A-infinity ring]]: to which extent is an algebra object in a monoidal $(\infty,1)$-category the same as an algebra for the corresponding operad. Probably more on this is in the PhD thesis of J. Francis.
