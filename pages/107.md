## Idea

[[Carlos Simpson]] conjectured, in the context of [[semi-strict infinity-categories]] that every [[weak omega-category]] is [[equivalence|equivalent]] to one that is a [[strict omega-category]] except for the units.

## Statement

In 

* [[Carlos Simpson]], _Homotopy types of strict 3-groupoids_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/9810059))

it was conjectured ([page 27](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/math/pdf/9810/9810059v1.pdf#page=27)) that

**Simpson's Conjecture:** _Every weak $\infty$-[[infinity-category|category]] is equivalent to an $\infty$-category in which [[strict omega-category|composition and exchange laws are strict]] and only the unit laws are allowed to hold weakly._ 

For weak unit laws in $\infty$-categories see

* Joachim Kock,  _Weak identity arrows in higher categories_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.CT/0507116))

In 

* Joyal, Kock, _Weak units and homotopy 3-types_ ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.CT/0602084))

Simpson's conjecture is proven up to the case of 3-categories with a single object.

## Remarks

One expects several alternative such [[semi-strict infinity-category|semi-strictification]] statements. Eugenia Cheng and Nick Gurski write the following at the end of their paper:

Finally we consider the question of eliminating the distinguished invertible 
elements by using a stricter form of $n$-category. Generalising from the previous 
sections, we see that we do not need to restrict all the way to strict $n$-categories 
– a semistrict version will suffice. One form of semistrictness has everything strict 
except interchange (cf. Gray-categories and see Crans 2000b, Crans 2000a); another has everything strict except units (Koch 2005, Simpson 1998). These have both been proposed 
as solutions to the coherence problem for $n$-categories. 

However, there are other possible “shades” of semistrictness and the above 
notions do not appear to be right for the present purposes. Instead, we need a 
form of semistrict $n$-category in which the units and interchange for $(n-1)$-cells 
are strict, but everything else can be weak. This is to eliminate the constraint 
$n$-cells that become distinguished invertible elements in our $n$-degenerate situation; 
we expect that as in the case $n = 2$ the associator is automatically forced to be the 
identity. 

**Hypothesis 5.3. Semistrictness**
Let $n \ge 3$. Then an $n$-degenerate semistrict $n$-category in the above sense is precisely a commutative monoid.
