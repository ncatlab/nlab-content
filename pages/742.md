The **slice category** **C**/$C$ of a category **C** over an object $C \in$ **C** has 

* objects that are all arrows $f \in$ **C** such that $cod(f) = C$, and

* morphisms $g: X \to X' in$ **C** from $f:X \to C$ to $f': X' \to C$ such that $f' \circ g = f$.

The slice category is also called the **over category**.  It is a special case of a [[comma category]].

**Examples**

* If **C** = **P** is a [[poset]] and $p \in$ **P**, then the slice category **P**/$p$ is the "principal ideal" $\downarrow (p)$ of elements $q \in$ **P** with $q \leq p$. 

* If $1$ is a [[terminal object]] in **C**, then **C**/$1$ is isomorphic to **C**.
