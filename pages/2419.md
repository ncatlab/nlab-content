## Idea

A _modular form_  is a [[holomorphic function]] on the [[upper half-plane]] that satisfies certain transformation property under the [[action]] of the [[modular group]]. Abstractly this transformation property makes the function a [[section]] of a certain [[line bundle]] on the [[quotient]] of the [[upper half plane]] that makes it the [[moduli stack of elliptic curves]] (over the [[complex numbers]]) or more generally the [[Riemann moduli space]] for [[Riemann surfaces]] of given [[genus]].

Modular forms are also often called _classical [[automorphic forms]]_, see [below]()



Modular forms appear as the [[coefficient]] ring of the [[Witten genus]] on manifolds with rational [[string structure]]. For manifolds with actual [[string structure]] this refines to [[topological modular forms]], which are the [[homotopy groups]] of the [[spectrum]] [[tmf]].

###### Definition

An **(integral) [[modular form]]** of weight $w$ is a [[holomorphic function]] on the [[upper half-plane]]

$$
  f : (\mathbb{R}^2)_+ \hookrightarrow \mathbb{C}
$$

(complex numbers with strictly positive imaginary part) 

such that

1. if $A = \left( \array{a & b \\ c& d}\right) \in SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ acting by $A : \tau \mapsto = \frac{a \tau + b }{c \tau + d}$ we have
 
   $$
     f(A(\tau)) = (c \tau + d)^w f(\tau)
   $$

   (notice that for $A = \left( \array{1 & 1 \\ 0& 1}\right)$ then  $f(\tau + 1) = f(\tau)$)

1. $f$ has at worst a pole at $\{0\}$ (for _weak_ modular forms this condition is relaxed)

   it follows that $f = f(q)$ with $q = e^{2 \pi i \tau}$ is a meromorphic funtion on the open disk.


1. **integrality** $\tilde f(q) = \sum_{k = -N}^\infty a_k \cdot q^k$ then $a_k \in \mathbb{Z}$

=--

More generally there is such a definition for $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ replaced by any other arithmetic subgroup $\Gamma \subset SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ (e.g. [Litt, def.1](#Litt)), giving modular forms on a [[Riemann moduli spaces]].



### As sections of a line bundle over the moduli stack
 {#AsSections}

More abstractly, for $\mathcal{M}_{ell}$ the [[moduli stack of elliptic curves]] (or rather its [[Deligne-Mumford compactification]]) and $A \to \mathcal{M}_{ell}$ the corresponding universal bundle, write $\Omega^1_{A/S}$ for the [[line bundle]] of fiberwise [[Kähler differential forms]]. Write $e$ for the 0-[[section]] of this line bundle. Then

$$
  \omega \coloneqq e^\ast \Omega^1_{A/S}
$$ 

is a [[line bundle]] over the [[moduli stack of elliptic curves]]. A modular form of weight $k$  is a [[section]] of $\omega^{\otimes k}$


### For congruence subgroups
 {#ForCongruenceSubgroups}

Similarly one considers modular forms for [[congruence subgroups]] of the full [[modular group]], hence on the space of [[elliptic curves with level structure]].

### As automorphic forms
 {#AsAutomorphicForms}

Instead of regarding, as [above](#AsSections), modular forms as [[sections]] of a [[line bundle]] on a [[quotient]] of the [[upper half plane]], one may regard them alternatively as plain functions, but on the ([[Möbius group|projective]]) [[special linear group]] $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$. (e.g. [Martin 13, section 2](Martin13), [Litt, section 2](#Litt)).

As such these functions are then invariant under the [[action]] of the [[modular group|modular]] [[subgroup]] $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})\hookrightarrow SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ and hence are really functions on the [[coset space]] $SL(2,\mathbb{R})/SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ (for forms on moduli of elliptic curves) or more generally $\Gamma \backslash SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ (for forms on moduli of more general [[Riemann surfaces]]).

This generalizes to the case of other [[congruence subgroups]] (as [above](ForCongruenceSubgroups)). Generally such functions on [[coset spaces]] like this are called _[[automorphic forms]]_. See there for more.

For the history of the terminology "modular form"/"automorphic form" see also [this MO comment](http://mathoverflow.net/a/124785/381).

## Properties

### Relation of $MF_0(2)$ to the elliptic genus

Write $\Gamma_0(2) \hookrightarrow SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ for the [[subgroup]] of the [[modular group]] on those elements $\left(\array{a & b \\ c & d}\right)$ for which $c = 0\, mod\, 2$.

A modular function for $\Gamma_0(2)$ is a [[meromorphic function]] on the [[upper half plane]] which transforms as a modular form under the action of $\Gamma_0(2) \hookrightarrow SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$. Write $MF_\bullet(\Gamma_0(2))$ for the ring of these.

There is a natural isomorphism

$$
  MF_\bullet(\Gamma_0(2)) \simeq \mathbb{C}[\epsilon, \delta]
$$

(see at [[elliptic genus]]) for the notation.

([Landweber-Ravenel-Stong 93, theorem 1.5 and sections 5.3, 5.8](#LandweberRavenelStong93))

### Relation to elliptic cohomology

For $E$ the [[elliptic cohomology theory]] associated to the [[elliptic curve]] $C$, then 

$$
  E_{2n} \simeq \omega(C)^{\otimes n}
$$

(where $\omega$ is the line bundle from [above ](#AsSections))

and 

$$
  E_{2n+1}\simeq 0
  \,.
$$
