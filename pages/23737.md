## Idea

A smooth functor is an [[endofunctor]] of [[FinVect]], when $FinVect$ is viewed as a category enriched in the category of [[smooth manifolds]].

That is, a smooth functor is a functor $F \colon FinVect \to FinVect$ such that the map $FinVect(X,Y) \to FinVect(F(X),F(Y))$ is smooth for every $X$, $Y$.

## Examples

The iterated tensor product $X \mapsto X^{\otimes n}$ is a smooth functor.

The iterated wedge product $X \mapsto \bigwedge_{i=1}^n X$ is a smooth functor

## Extensions

The concept of smooth functor can be extended to multivariate functors $FinVect^n \to FinVect$, and also to contravariant functors $FinVect^{op} \to FinVect$, such as the dual $V \mapsto V^*$.
