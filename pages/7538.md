## Idea

A _line integral_ is an [[integral]] along a [[curve]].  These are also called _path integrals_ (not to be confused with the [[path integral]] in quantum field theory, which is integration over a space of curves rather than along a curve in some space) and _contour integrals_ (in [[complex analysis]]).

By the modern understanding of the integration of [[differential forms]], one integrates $1$-forms ([[cotangent vector fields]]) along [[orientation|oriented]] curves, and so this would be the natural way to understand a line integral.  However, there are several slightly different line integrals, and not all of them are reducible to integration of $1$-forms along oriented curves.  Sometimes we have to fall back on more basic notions, ultimately the integration of [[pseudoform|pseudo]]-$1$-forms on a $1$-dimensional space.

Here are a couple of old Usenet posts that explain how line integrals of *scalar* fields should be viewed in terms of forms and pseudoforms.
