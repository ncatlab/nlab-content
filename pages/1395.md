
__Michael Makkai__ (Hungarian original __Mih&#225;ly Makkai__) is a Canadian mathematician born in Hungary; he studied in Budapest and Warsaw. He is the inventor of [[anafunctors]] and [[FOLDS]], which are both ways of doing [[category theory]] and [[higher category theory]] without violating the [[principle of equivalence]] or requiring the [[axiom of choice]].  Makkai is a pioneer in the [[category theory|category-theoretic]] approach to [[logic]] (which is mostly the approach that you see here on the $n$-Lab).
