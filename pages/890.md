## Definitions

Given a [[set]] $S$ and an [[equivalence relation]] $\equiv$ on $S$, the __quotient set__ of $S$ by $\equiv$ is the set $S/{\equiv}$ whose elements are the elements of $S$ but where two elements are now considered [[equality|equal]] if in $S$ they were merely equivalent.

If changing the definition of equality like this is not allowed in your [[foundations]] of mathematics, then you can still define $S/{\equiv}$ as a [[subset]] of the [[power set]] of $S$ as follows:
\[\label{setdef}
A \in S/{\equiv} \;\Leftrightarrow\; \exists (x: S),\; A = \{y: S \;\mid\; x \equiv y\}\]
If you don\'t have (extensional) power sets either, then you\'ll have to use [[setoids]] (in which case, perhaps you\'d do better to change your terminology as described there).  Alternatively, don\'t worry about any of this and just include the existence of [[quotient objects]] in [[Set]] as an axiom (the __axiom of quotient sets__, which you have if you assume that $\Set$ is a [[pretopos]] or a [[Grothendieck topos]] as given by [[Giraud's axioms]]).

In any case, the element of $S/{\equiv}$ that comes from the element $x$ of $S$ may be denoted $[x]_{\equiv}$, or simply $[x]$ if ${\equiv}$ is understood, or simply $x$ if there will be no confusion as to which set it is an element of.  This $[x]$ is called the __[[equivalence class]]__ of $x$ with respect to $\equiv$; the term 'class' here is an old word for 'set' (in the sense of 'subset') and refers to the definition (eq:setdef) above, where $[x]$ is literally the set $A$.


## Generalisations

Quotient sets in [[Set]] generalise to [[quotient object]]s in other categories.  In particular, an [[exact category]] is a [[regular category]] in which every [[congruence]] on every object has an effective quotient object.
