A [[symmetric function]] $f$ with coefficients in the field is Schur positive if when written in the basis of Schur polynomials $f = \sum_\mu a_\mu s_\mu$, all coefficients $a_\mu$ are positive.

> We extend the big and p-typical Witt vector functors from commutative rings to commutative semirings. In the case of the big Witt vectors, this is a repackaging of some standard facts about monomial and Schur positivity in the combinatorics of symmetric functions. In the p-typical case, it uses positivity with respect to an apparently new basis of the p-typical symmetric functions.
