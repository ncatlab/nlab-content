## Idea

Where [[homotopy groups]] are groups of [[homotopy classes]] of maps  out [[spheres]], $\pi_n(X)\coloneqq [S^n \to X]$, cohomotopy groups are groups of homotopy classes _into_ spheres, $\pi^n(X) \coloneqq [X \to S^n]$.

If instead one considers mapping into the [[stabilization]] of the spheres, hence into (some [[suspension spectrum|suspension]] of) the [[sphere spectrum]], then one speaks of _[[stable cohomotopy]]_. In other words, the [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] theory which is [[Brown representability theorem|represented]] by the [[sphere spectrum]] is _stable cohomotopy_.

In this vein, regarding terminology: the concept of [[cohomology]] (as discussed there) in the very general sense of [[non-abelian cohomology]], is about [[homotopy classes]] of maps _into_ any object $A$ (in some [[(âˆž,1)-topos]]). In this way, general non-abelian cohomology is sort of dual to homotopy, and hence might generally be called co-homotopy. This is the statement of _[[Eckmann-Hilton duality]]_. The duality between homotopy (groups) and co-homotopy proper may then be thought of as being the special case of this where $A$ is taken to be a sphere. 

## Properties

### Relation to Freudenthal suspension theorem

relation to the [[Freudenthal suspension theorem]] ([Spanier 49, section 9](#Spanier49))


### Smooth representatives

For $X$ a [[compact topological space|compact]] [[smooth manifold]], there is a [[smooth function]] $X \to S^n$ representing every cohomotopy class (with respect to the standard [[smooth structure]] on the [[sphere]] [[manifold]]).
