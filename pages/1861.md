The notion of [[cohomology]]  -- in its generalization beyond [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology]] to [[nonabelian cohomology]] -- is related by abstract [[duality]] to [[homotopy]].

Therefore it does make sense to speak of general [[cohomology]] as **co-homotopy**.

Indeed, [[cohomology]] is a concept [[duality|dual]] to [[homology]] only in the very restrictive simple case of [[chain homology and cohomology]]. And this is really just because in this simple case it so happens that [[homotopy]] of [[chain complex]]es is their [[homology]]. (This is in a sense part of the statement of the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]].)

So on general grounds the word "cohomotopy" is actually better suited than "cohomology" for a concept of such fundamental importance. 

But the use of "cohomology" is deeply rooted in tradition and will hardly be changed just because the $n$Lab says so. Even though it should.
