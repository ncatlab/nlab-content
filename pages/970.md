A **large category** is a [[category]] which is not [[small category|small]].

See also: [[foundations]], [[locally small category]].

I\'m inclined to redirect this page to [[small category]] (which is where I make most links from 'large' or 'large category' in the wiki).  On the other hand, we could expand this page with techniques to deal with large categories, much like at [[large site]].  ---Toby
