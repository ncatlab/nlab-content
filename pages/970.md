A **large category** is a [[category]] which is not [[small category|small]].

Many tools and results about small categories, in particular concerning [[limit]]s indexed by such a category, fail for large categories. There are various notions and techniques to deal with this problem and reduce or relate large categories to small categories as much as possible:

* In the simplest case the large category is *essentially* small in that it is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to a [[small category]].  Then (for all non-[[evil]] purposes) you can simply replace it with a small category.

* Many large categories that arise in practice are (even essentially) large but still *accessible*.  An [[accessible category]] is a large category which behaves like the category of [[ind-object]]s of a small category and is therefore, while itself large, entirely governed by a small category.
