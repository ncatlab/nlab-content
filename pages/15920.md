## Idea

Strict analytic geometry is the study of analytic spaces over Banach
rings with building blocs given by strict rational domains (defined, for
example, by relations of the form $\{x,\;|f(x)|\leq |g(x)|\neq 0$)
in polydiscs of radius one.

In the $p$-adic setting, strict analytic geometry is
usually called [[rigid analytic geometry]]. In the archimedean setting
(i.e., over $\C$), strict analytic geometry is essentially equivalent to usual
analytic geometry.

There is a natural notion of strict [[global analytic geometry]] that has some
non-trivial relation with the ideas of [[Arakelov geometry]].
