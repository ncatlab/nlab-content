
Fix a [[timelike curve]] $\gamma$ in [[spacetime]], thought of as representing an [[observer]].  If $H$ is a [[hypersurface]] in spacetime, then (at least if spacetime is [[orientation|orientable]] and possibly otherwise), $H$ separates spacetime into two regions, arbitrarily called the inside and outside.  Then $H$ is an __event horizon__ (relative to $\gamma$) if $\gamma$ never intersects the [[future]] of the inside of $H$.  (It follows that $\gamma$ lies entirely outside $H$.)

Although we have given this definition relative to an observer, we can reverse the situation, beginning with a [[lightlike]] hypersurface $H$ and noting that $H$ is a horizon relative to every observer that remains in the [[past]] of $H$ (of which, unlike for a [[spacelike]] hypersurface, there are typically many).  This includes the horizon around a [[black hole]] and the future [[light cone]] of any event.

Theoretically, the observer outside an event horizon will observe [[Bekenstein-Hawking entropy]] at the horizon and [[Hawking radiation]] from it.  In the case of an observer accelerating to remain outside a future light cone, this is the [[Unruh effect]].
