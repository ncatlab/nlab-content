## In type theory

In [[computer science]] a _program_ is a construction of a [[term]] of a certain [[type]] (the output of the program). 

Under [[computational trinitarianism]] this is essentially the same as a [[proof]] in [[type theory]]  of the [[proposition]] presented by the type (see at _[[propositions as types]]_ and  _[[proofs as programs]]_).
