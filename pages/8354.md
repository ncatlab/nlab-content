## In type theory

In [[type theory]] a _program_ is the same as a  [[proof]] (see _[[proofs as programs]]_): since here proof means, _[[constructive mathematics|constructive]] proof_ this consists of explicitly [[definition|defining]] a [[term]] of a certain [[type]] (by _[[propositions as types]]_).
