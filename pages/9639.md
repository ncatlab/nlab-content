## Idea

A [[physical system]] in [[solid state physics]] consisting of [[electrons]] confined to an essentially 2-dimensional surface and subject to a perpendicular [[magnetic field]].

In an appropriate limit of low [[temperature]] aspects of this system are described by the [[topological quantum field theory]] called _[[Chern-Simons theory]]_. In this limit the system has been proposed as constituting a possible implementation of [[topological quantum computation]].
