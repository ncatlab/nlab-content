Given groups $G_i$ $i\in I$ one defines their __free product__ $G_1\star G_2\star\ldots = \star_i G_i$ using their presentations (hence the existence of free groups with given set of generators): thus let $G_i = \langle S_i|R_i\rangle = F_i/N_i$ where $F_i=\langle S_i\rangle$ are free groups on sets $S_i$ and $N_i\subset F_i$ are their normal subgroups generated by subsets $R_i\subset F_i$, then the free product 

$$\star_i G_i := \langle \coprod_i S_i | \coprod_i R_i \rangle = (\star_i F_i)/\langle\cup_i N_i\rangle$$

The result (up to an isomorphism) does not depend on the presentation.
