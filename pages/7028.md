## Idea

An [[observable]] in [[quantum physics]].

## Definition in geometric quantization

We consider the notion of quantum observables in the the context of [[geometric quantization]]. See also [[quantum operator (in geometric quantization)]].

### On a symplectic manifold

Let $(X, \omega)$ be a [[symplectic manifold]], thought
of as the [[phase space]] of a [[classical mechanics|physical system]].

Let $\nabla : X \to \mathbf{B} U(1)_{conn}$ be a
[[prequantum line bundle]] $E \to X$ [[connection on a bundle|with connection]] for $\omega$. Write $\Gamma_X(E)$ for its space of smooth [[sections]], the _prequantum space of states_.

###### Definition

For $f \in C^\infty(X, \mathbb{C})$ a function on phase space, the corresponding **pre-quantum operator** is the linear map on prequantum states

$$
  \hat f : \Gamma_X(E) \to \Gamma_X(E)
$$

given by

$$
  \psi \mapsto -i \nabla_{v_f} \psi + f \cdot \psi
  \,,
$$

where 

* $v_f$ is the [[Hamiltonian vector field]]
corresponding to $f$;

* $\nabla_{v_f} : \Gamma_X(E) \to \Gamma_X(E)$ is the [[covariant derivative]] of sections along $v_f$ for the given choice of prequantum connection;

* $f \cdot (-) : \Gamma_X(E) \to \Gamma_X(E)$ is the operation of degreewise multiplication pf sections.

Now after a choice of [[polarization]] a [[quantum state]] is a prequantum [[wave function]] which is covariantly constant along the [[Lagrangian submanifolds]] of the foliation. Not all prequantum operators will respect the space of such quantum states inside all quantum states. Those that do become genuine quantum operators.
