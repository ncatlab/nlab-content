## Idea

What is called the _décalage_ of a [[simplicial set]] is a model for its [[path space object]], similar to, but smaller than, the model $X^I \times_X X_0$, (as discussed at [[factorization lemma]]).

## Definition 

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

For $X$ a [[simplicial set]],
the **décalage** $Dec\, X \in sSet$ of $X$, is the simplicial set obtained by shifting every dimension down by one, 'forgetting' the last face and degeneracy  of $X$ in each dimension:

* $(Dec \, X)_n := X_{n+1}$;
* $d_k^{n,Dec \,X}  := d^{n+1,x}_{k}$;
* $s_k^{n,Dec \,X}  := s^{n+1,X}_{k}$.

+-- {: .num_prop #TheCanonicalMorphisms}
###### Proposition


This simplicial set comes with 

* a natural morphism of simplicial sets, 

  $$
    d_{last} : Dec\, Y \to Y
    \,,
  $$

  given in degree $n$ by the remaining face map 
  $d_{n+1} : X_{n+1} \to X_n$;

* a natural morphism

  $$
    Dec X \to const X_0
  $$

  to the [[discrete object|discrete]] simplicial set on the set of 0-cells of $X$, given in degree 0 by $d_0 : X_1 \to X_0$ and in every higher degree similarly by $d_0 \circ d_0 \circ \cdots \circ d_0$.

## Properties

### Fibration resolution

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

For $X$ a simplicial set, the two morphisms from prop. \ref{TheCanonicalMorphisms} have the following properties.

* the morphism $d_0 : Dec X \to const X_0$ is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]], in fact a [[deformation retract]]; a weak inverse is given by the morphism which in degree 0 is the degeneracy $s_0 : X_0 \to X_1$, and so on.

If $X$ is a [[Kan complex]], then

* the morphism $d_{last} : Dec X \to X$ is a [[Kan fibration]];

=--

The first statement is classical, it appears for instance as ([Stevenson, lemma 5](#Stevenson)).

+-- {: .num_cor}
###### Corollary

For $X$ a simplicial set, the décalage morphism $Dec X \to X$ is a [[Kan fibration]] [[resolution]] of the inclusion $const X_0 \to X$ of the set of 0-cells of $X$, regarded as a [[discrete object|discrete]] simplicial set:

there is a diagram

$$
  \array{
    const X_0 &\stackrel{\simeq}{\to}& Dec X
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    X &\to& X
  }
  \,,
$$

where

* the top morphism 

  * is given in degree $n$ by the $n$-fold degeneracy map $s_0 \circ s_0 \circ \cdots s_0$;

  * is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]];

* the right vertical morphism 

  * is given in degree $n$ by $d_{n+1} : X_{n+1} \to X_n$ 

  * is a [[Kan fibration]].

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark

The inclusion $const X_0 \to X$ presents a canonical [[effective epimorphism in an (∞,1)-category]] in [[∞Grpd]] into $X$, out of a [[0-truncated]] object. By the above, the décalage is a natural fibration resolution of this morphism.

This is useful for instance in the discussion of [[homotopy pullbacks]] of this effective epimorphism: by the discussion there the homotopy pullback of $const X_0 \to X$ along any morphism $f : A \to X$ is presented by the ordinary pullback of any Kan fibration resolution, hence in particular of the décalage projection:

$$
  f^* Dec X \simeq A \times_X^{h} const X_0
  \,.
$$

### Decalage comonad 

Décalage also has an abstract [[category theory|category theoretic]] description as follows. The [[simplex category]], as a [[monoidal category]] $(\Delta, +, 0)$ equipped with the [[monoid]] $1$, is the "[[walking structure|walking]] [[monoid]]", i.e., is initial among monoidal categories equipped with a monoid. Therefore $\Delta^{op}$ is the walking [[comonoid]]; as a result, there is a [[comonad]] 

$$- + 1: \Delta^{op} \to \Delta^{op}$$ 

which induces a comonad on simplicial sets whose underlying functor is precisely décalage: 

$$Dec: Set^{\Delta^{op}} \to Set^{\Delta^{op}}$$

The map $d_{last}: Dec \to Id$ is the counit of this comonad. The comonad itself is analogous to a kind of unbased [[path space object]] comonad $P$ on $Top$ whose value at a space $X$ is a pullback 

$$\array{
P X & \to & X^I \\
\downarrow & & \downarrow eval_0 \\
|X| & \stackrel{i}{\to} & X
}$$

where $i$ is the set-theoretic identity inclusion of $X$ equipped with the discrete topology. Thus we have 

$$P X = \sum_{x_0 \in X} P(X, x_0),$$ 

the sum over all possible basepoints $x_0$ of path spaces based at $x_0$. The analogy is made precise by a canonical isomorphism 

$$Dec \circ S \cong S \circ P$$ 

where $S: Top \to Set^{\Delta^{op}}$ is simplicial singularization. 

A $P$-coalgebra partitions $X$ into path components and exhibits contractibility of each component. Similarly, a coalgebra of the decelage comonad exhibits the acyclicity of the underlying simplicial set. 

####Total Décalage####

 Using either the simplicial [[comonadic resolution]] generated by the above comonad or directly using [[ordinal sum]], we get a [[bisimplicial set]] known as the [[total decalage|total décalage]] of $Y$. See there for more details.

## Examples

### For simplicial groups

The case of $Dec G$ for $G$ a [[simplicial group]] is important in the simplicial theory of algebraic models for [[homotopy n-types]].

In this case the morphism $d_{last} : Dec\, G \to G$, is an [[epimorphism]].  Taking the [[kernel]] of this and then applying $\pi_0$, yields a [[crossed module]] constructed from the [[Moore complex]] of $G$

$$N G_1/d_2(NG_2)\to N G_0,$$

which has kernel $\pi_1(G)$ and cokernel $\pi_0(G)$.
