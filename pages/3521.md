
## Definition 

The **décalage** of an arbitrary simplicial set, $Y$, is the simplicial set, $Dec\, Y$, defined by shifting every dimension down by one, 'forgetting' the last face and degeneracy  of $Y$ in each dimension. 

 More precisely

* $(Dec \, Y)_n = Y_{n+1}$;
* $d_k^{n,Dec \,Y}  = d^{n+1,Y}_{k}$;
* $s_k^{n,Dec \,Y}  = s^{n+1,Y}_{k}$.




This simplicial set comes with a natural projection, $d_{last} : Dec\, Y \to Y$, given by the 'left over' face map.     Moreover this map gives a homotopy equivalence

$$Dec\,Y \simeq K(Y_0,0),$$

between $Dec\, Y$ and the constant simplicial set on $Y_0$. 

The same construction works in other contexts, as is easily seen. The case of $Dec G$ for $G$ a [[simplicial group]] is important in the simplicial theory of algebraic models for [[homotopy n-type]]s.

The map $d_{last} : Dec\, Y \to Y$, is a fibration, and in particular, in the simplicial group case, $d_{last} : Dec\, G \to G$, is an epimorphism.  Taking the kernel of this and then applying $\pi_0$, yields a [[crossed module]] constructed from the [[Moore complex]] of $G$

$$NG_1/d_2(NG_2)\to NG_0,$$

which has kernel $\pi_1(G)$ and cokernel $\pi_0(G)$.

## Decalage comonad 

Decalage also has an abstract nonsense description as follows. The simplicial category, as a monoidal category $(\Delta, +, 0)$ equipped with the monoid $1$, is the "walking monoid", i.e., is initial among monoidal categories equipped with a monoid. Therefore $\Delta^{op}$ is the walking comonoid; as a result, there is a comonad 

$$- + 1: \Delta^{op} \to \Delta^{op}$$ 

which induces a comonad on simplicial sets whose underlying functor is precisely decalage: 

$$Dec: Set^{\Delta^{op}} \to Set^{\Delta^{op}}$$

The map $d_{last}: Dec \to Id$ is the counit of this comonad. The comonad itself is analogous to a kind of unbiased path space comonad $P$ on $Top$ whose value at a space $X$ is a pullback 

$$\array{
P X & \to & X^I \\
\downarrow & & \downarrow eval_0 \\
|X| & \stackrel{i}{\to} & X
}$$

where $i$ is the set-theoretic identity inclusion of $X$ equipped with the discrete topology. Thus we have 

$$P X = \sum_{x_0 \in X} P(X, x_0),$$ 

the sum over all possible basepoints $x_0$ of path spaces based at $x_0$. The analogy is made precise by a canonical isomorphism 

$$Dec \circ S \cong S \circ P$$ 

where $S: Top \to Set^{\Delta^{op}}$ is simplicial singularization. 

A $P$-coalgebra partitions $X$ into path components and exhibits contractibility of each component. Similarly, a coalgebra of the decelage comonad exhibits the acyclicity of the underlying simplicial set. 

####Total Décalage####
 Using either the simplicial [[comonadic resolution]] generated by the above comonad or directly using ordinal sum, we get a [[bisimplicial set]] known as the [[total décalage]] of $Y$. This will be explored more fully in a separate entry.

## Literature

 A reasonably full discussion of the décalage can be found in Luc Illusie’s thesis,

Springer-Verlag. and  1972, _Complexe cotangent et deformations II_, volume 283 of Lecture Notes in 
Maths , Springer-Verlag.

The notion of decalage is widely appearing since the paper introducing the method of [[cohomological descent]] in [[Hodge theory]]:
