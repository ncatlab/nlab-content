## Idea

The notions of [[regular category]], [[exact category]], [[coherent category]], [[extensive category]], and [[pretopos]] can be nicely unified in a theory of "familial regularity and exactness."  This was apparently first noticed by [[Ross Street]].


## Sinks and relations

Let $C$ be a [[finitely complete category]].  By a **sink** in $C$ we mean a family $\{f_i\colon A_i \to B\}_{i\in I}$ of [[morphism]]s with common [[target]].  A sink $\{f_i\colon A_i \to B\}$ is **strong epic** if it doesn't factor through any proper [[subobject]] of $B$.  The _pullback_ of a sink along a morphism $B' \to B$ is defined in the evident way.

By a (many-object) **[[relation]]** in $C$ we will mean a family of objects $\{A_i\}_{i\in I}$ together with, for every $i,j\in I$, a monic span $A_i \leftarrow R_{i j} \to A_j$  (that is, a [[subobject]] $R_{i j}$ of $A_i \times A_j$.  We say such a relation is:

* [[reflexive relation|reflexive]] if $R_{i i}$ contains the diagonal $A_i \to A_i \times A_i$, for all $i$,
* [[transitive relation|transitive]] if the pullback $R_{i j} \times_{A_j} R_{j k}$ factors through $R_{i k}$, for all $i,j,k$,
* [[symmetric relation|symmetric]] if $R_{i j}$ contains, hence is equal to, the transpose of $R_{j i}$ for all $i,j$, and
* a [[congruence]] if it is reflexive, transitive, and symmetric; this is an internal notion of [[equivalence relation]].

Abstractly, reflexive and transitive relations can be identified with categories [[enriched category|enriched]] in a suitable [[bicategory]]; see (Street 1984).  Congruences can be identified with enriched $\dagger$-[[dagger-categories|categories]].

A _quotient_ for a relation is a [[colimit]] for the diagram consisting of all the $A_i$ and all the spans $A_i \leftarrow R_{i j} \to A_j$.  And the _kernel_ of a sink $\{f_i\colon A_i\to B\}$ is the relation on $\{A_i\}$ with $R_{i j} = A_i \times_B A_j$.  It is evidently a congruence.

For example:

* If ${|I|} = 1$, a congruence is the same as the ordinary internal notion of [[congruence]].  In this case [[quotient object|quotients]] and [[kernel pair|kernels]] reduce to the usual notions.

* If ${|I|} = 0$, a congruence contains no data and a sink is just an object in C.  The empty congruence is, trivially, the kernel of the empty sink with target B, and a quotient for the empty congruence is an [[initial object]].

* Given a family of objects $\{A_i\}$, define a congruence by $R_{i i}=A_i$ and $R_{i j}=0$ (an initial object) if $i \neq j$.  Call a congruence of this sort _trivial_ (empty congruences are always trivial).  Then a quotient for a trivial congruence is a [[coproduct]] of the objects $A_i$, and the kernel of a sink $\{f_i\colon A_i\to B\}$ is trivial iff the $f_i$ are disjoint monomorphisms.


## Familial regularity and exactness

In what follows, we let $\kappa$ be a [[class]] of [[cardinal numbers]] with the following properties:

1. $1\in \kappa$.
2. If $\lambda\in\kappa$, then an indexed sum $\sum_{i\in\lambda} \alpha_i$ is in $\kappa$ if and only if each $\alpha_i$ is in $\kappa$.

At least in [[classical mathematics]], there are then only four possibilities:

* $\kappa$ is the [[proper class]] of all cardinal numbers,
* $\kappa$ is the set of cardinal numbers smaller than some infinite [[regular cardinal]],
* $\kappa = \{0,1\}$ (the set of cardinal numbers less than $2$), or
* $\kappa = \{1\}$.

Arguably, one ought to *define* the term 'regular cardinal' to mean precisely such a collection.  In any case, the two properties above are what matter to us.

We refer to a sink or relation as **$\kappa$-ary** if the cardinality ${|I|}$ is an element of $\kappa$.  The cases of most interest have special names:

* When $\kappa = \{1\}$ we say **unary**.
* When $\kappa = \omega$ is the set of finite cardinals, we say **finitary**.
* When $\kappa$ is the class of all cardinal numbers, we say **infinitary**.

We say that a finitely complete category $C$ is **$\kappa$-ary regular** if the following hold.

* Every $\kappa$-ary sink factors as a strong epic sink followed by a monomorphism.
* The pullback of any strong epic $\kappa$-ary sink is strong epic.

We say that $C$ is **$\kappa$-ary exact** if it is $\kappa$-ary regular and in addition

* every $\kappa$-ary congruence is the kernel of some sink.

One can show (Street 1984) that in a $\kappa$-ary regular category, every strong epic $\kappa$-ary sink is the quotient of its kernel, and that any $\kappa$-ary congruence that is a kernel has a quotient.  Thus, in a $\kappa$-ary exact category, every $\kappa$-ary congruence has a quotient.  In fact, one can alternately define a $\kappa$-ary regular category to be one in which every $\kappa$-ary congruence which is a kernel has a pullback-stable quotient.

It is then not difficult to verify that

1. $C$ is [[regular category|regular]] iff it is unary regular.
2. $C$ is [[coherent category|coherent]] iff it is finitary regular.
3. $C$ is [[coherent category|infinitary-coherent]] iff it is [[well-powered category|well-powered]] and infinitary regular.
4. $C$ is [[exact category|exact]] iff it is unary exact.
5. $C$ is a [[pretopos]] iff it is finitary exact.
6. $C$ is an [[pretopos|infinitary pretopos]] iff it is [[well-powered category|well-powered]] and infinitary exact.
7. $C$ is [[extensive category|lextensive]] iff every finitary _trivial_ congruence has a pullback-stable quotient of which it is the kernel.
8. $C$ is [[extensive category|infinitary-lextensive]] iff every (small) trivial congruence has a pullback-stable quotient of which it is the kernel.

Actually, Street's paper referenced below gives a version of regularity and exactness that applies even to some _large_ sinks and congruences.
