Under construction

##Idea##

As well as considering modalities applied to propositions in _propositional_ [[modal logic]], logicians have also studied modalities applied to predicate logic, or *first-order modal logic*. Here we can represent statements such as 
: $\Box \exists x P(x)$, Necessarily there exists something which is $P$.
: $\exists x \Box P(x)$, There exists something which is necessarily $P$.

##Semantics##

Awodey and Kishida showed that S4 first-order modal logic is complete with respect to a [[sheaf]]-theoretic semantics. Other approaches involve metaframes, counterpart frames, coherence frames (Kracht&Kutz, Shehtman/Skvortsov, Shirasu) and [[ionads]].
