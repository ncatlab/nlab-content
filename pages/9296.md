## Idea

In [[quantum physics]] _decoherence_ refers to the disappearance of quantum [[entanglement]] and [[superposition]] in the limit where small [[quantum mechanical systems]] are coupled to large [[thermal baths]].

This has been argued to resolve (and has been argued not to resolve) the problem with the [[interpretation of quantum mechanics|interpretation]] of [[quantum measurement]].
