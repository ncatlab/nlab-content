A _0-groupoid_ or **[[homotopy n-type|0-type]]** a [[set]]. This terminology may seem strange at first, but it is very helpful to see sets as the beginning of a sequence of concepts: sets, [[groupoid|groupoids]], [[2-groupoid|2-groupoids]], [[3-groupoid|3-groupoids]], etc. Doing so reveals patterns such as the [[periodic table]]. (It also sheds light on the theory of [[homotopy group]]s and [[n-stuff]].)

For example, there should be a $1$-groupoid of $0$-groupoids; this is the [[underlying groupoid]] of the [[Set|category of sets]]. Then a [[enriched category|groupoid enriched]] over this is a $1$-groupoid (more precisely, a [[locally small category|locally small groupoid]]). Furthermore, an enriched category is a [[category]] (or $1$-category), so a $0$-groupoid is the same as a [[0-category]].

One can continue to define a [[(−1)-groupoid]] to be a [[truth value]] and a [[(−2)-groupoid]] to be a triviality (that is, there is exactly one).
