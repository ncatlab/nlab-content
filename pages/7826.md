###### Definition

A ([[topological space|topological]]) [[space]] whose only [[connected topological space|connected]] [[subspaces]] are the subspaces with at most one element is called *totally disconnected*.

###### Example
**(the rational numbers are totally disconnected)**

The [[rational numbers]] $\mathbb{Q} \subset \mathbb{R}$ equipped with their [[subspace topology]] inherited from the [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] [[metric topology]] on the [[real numbers]], form a totally disconnected space.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By construction, a [[base for a topology|base for the topology]] is given by the open subsets which are restrictions of [[open intervals]] of real numbers to the rational numbers

$$
  (a,b)_{\mathbb{Q}} \coloneqq (a,b) \cap \mathbb{Q}
$$

for $a \lt b \in \mathbb{R}$.

Now for any such $a \lt b$ there exists an [[irrational number]] $r \in \mathbb{R}\backslash \mathbb{Q}$ with $a \lt r \lt b$. This being irrational implies that $(a,r)_{\mathbb{Q}} \subset \mathbb{Q}$ and $(r,b)_{\mathbb{Q}} \subset \mathbb{Q}$ are disjoint subsets. Therefore every basic open subset is the disjoint union of (at least) two open subsets:

$$
  (a,b)_{\mathbb{Q}} = (a,r)_{\mathbb{Q}} \cup (r,b)_{\mathbb{Q}}
  \,.
$$

Hence no [[inhabited set|inhabited]] open subspace of the rational numbers is connected.

###### Example

[[profinite group|profinite groups]] are totally disconnected and in particular the set of [[p-adic number|p-adic numbers]] is totally disconnected.
