## Idea

Traditionally, as a discipline, __logic__ is the study of correct methods of reasoning.  Logicians have principally studied [[deduction]], the process of passing from premises to conclusion in such a way that the [[truth]] of the former necessitates the truth of the latter. In other words, deductive logic studies what it is for an argument to be _valid_. A second branch of logic studies [[inductive reasoning|induction]], reasoning about how to assess the plausibility of general propositions from observations of their instances. This has often been done in terms of [[probability theory]], particularly [[Bayesian reasoning|Bayesian]].

Some [[philosophy|philosophers]], notably [[Charles Peirce]], considered there to be third variety of reasoning for logic to study, namely, [[abduction]]. This is a process whereby one reasons to the truth of an explanation from its ability to account for what is observed. It is therefore sometimes also known as _inference to the best explanation_. At least some aspects of this can also be studied using Bayesian probability.

Deductive logic is the best developed of the branches. For centuries, treatments of the [[syllogism]] were at the forefront of the discipline. In the nineteenth century, however, spurred largely by the needs of [[mathematics]], in particular the need to handle [[relations]] and [[quantifiers]], a new logic emerged, known today as [[predicate logic]]. 

As we said above, logic is traditionally concerned with *correct* methods of reasoning, and philosophers (and others) have had much to say *prescriptively* about logic.  However, one can also study logic *descriptively*, taking it to be the study of methods of reasoning, without attempting to determine whether these methods are correct. One may study [[constructive logic]], or a [[substructural logic]], without saying that it should be adopted. Also psychologists study how people actually reason rapidly in situations without full information, such as by the [fast and frugal](http://fastandfrugal.com/) approach.

A __logic__ is a specific method of reasoning.  There are several ways to formalise a logic as a [[mathematics|mathematical]] object; see at _[[mathematical logic]]_.
