## Idea

As a discipline, __logic__ is the study of methods of reasoning.  While in the past (and often today in philosophical circles), this discipline was prescriptive (describing how one *should* reason), it is increasingly (and usually in mathematical circles) descriptive (describing how one *does* reason).

As a (potentially) mathematical object, a __logic__ is a specific method of reasoning.  There are several ways to formalise this which for the moment we will not to get into, but maybe later.


## Category-theoretic logic

It turns out that logic is naturally expressed in the language of [[category theory]]: given any [[category]] $C$, its [[object]]s $T$ may be understood as [[type]]s of terms, and morphisms $\psi \stackrel{\Psi}{\to} T$ as [[term]]s ([[generalized element]]s of $T$). A [[proposition]] is then a [[subobject]], $\phi \hookrightarrow T$ -- the subobject of all those variables for which the proposition is true.

In summary:

* [[type theory]] deals with understanding categories in terms of their [[slice categories]], collected in their [[codomain fibration]];

* logic deals with understanding [[subobject]]s, hence [[subterminal object]]s of these slice categories.

For instance, 

* [[limit]]s and [[colimit]]s, [[exponential]]s, and [[object classifier]]s belong to the [[type theory]], 

* while [[image]]s, dual images, [[intersection]]s, [[union]]s, and [[subobject classifiers]] belong to the logic.

* [[internal language]],
* [[syntactic category]].
