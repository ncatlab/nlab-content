## Idea

Traditionally, as a discipline, __logic__ is the study of correct methods of reasoning.  Logicians have principally studied [[deduction]], the process of passing from premises to conclusion in such a way that the truth of the former necessitates the truth of the latter. In other words, deductive logic studies what it is for an argument to be _valid_. A second branch of logic studies [[inductive reasoning|induction]], reasoning about how to assess the plausibility of general propositions from observations of their instances. This has often been done in terms of [[probability theory]], particularly Bayesian.

Some philosophers, notably [[Charles Peirce]], considered there to be third variety of reasoning for logic to study, namely, [[abduction]]. This is a process whereby one reasons to the truth of an explanation from its ability to account for what is observed. It is therefore sometimes also known as _inference to the best explanation_. At least some aspects of this can also be studied using Bayesian probability.

Deductive logic is the best developed of the branches. For centuries, treatments of the [[syllogism]] were at the forefront of the discipline. In the nineteenth century, however, spurred largely by the needs of mathematics, in particular the need to handle [[quantifiers]], a new logic emerged, known today as [[predicate logic]]. 

As we said above, logic is traditionally concerned with *correct* methods of reasoning, and philosophers (and others) have had much to say *prescriptively* about logic.  However, one can also study logic *descriptively*, taking it to be the study of methods of reasoning, without attempting to determine whether these methods are correct.

A __logic__ is a specific method of reasoning.  There are several ways to formalise this as a [[mathematics|mathematical]] object; see [[mathematical logic]].


## Category-theoretic logic

It turns out that logic is naturally expressed in the language of [[category theory]]: given any [[category]] $C$, its [[object]]s $T$ may be understood as [[type]]s of terms, and morphisms $\psi \stackrel{\Psi}{\to} T$ as [[term]]s ([[generalized element]]s of $T$). A [[proposition]] is then a [[subobject]], $\phi \hookrightarrow T$ -- the subobject of all those variables for which the proposition is true.

In summary:

* [[type theory]] deals with understanding categories in terms of their [[slice categories]], collected in their [[codomain fibration]];

* logic deals with understanding [[subobject]]s, hence [[subterminal object]]s of these slice categories.

For instance, 

* [[limit]]s and [[colimit]]s, [[exponential]]s, and [[object classifier]]s belong to the [[type theory]], 

* while [[image]]s, dual images, [[intersection]]s, [[union]]s, and [[subobject classifiers]] belong to the logic.
