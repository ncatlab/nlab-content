A **finitely complete category** is a [[category]] $C$ which admits all __finite limits__, that is all [[limit|limits]] for any [[diagrams]] $F: J \to C$ with $J$ a [[finite category]].  Finitely complete categories are also called **lex categories**.  They are also called (at least by Johnstone in the [[Elephant]] **cartesian categories**, although this term more often means a [[cartesian monoidal category]].

There are several well known reductions of this concept to classes of special limits. For example, a category is finitely complete if and only if:

* It has a [[terminal object]] and admits all binary [[product|products]] and [[equalizer|equalizers]]; or
* It has a [[terminal object]] and admits all binary [[pullback|pullbacks]].

An appropriate notion of morphism between finitely complete categories $C$, $D$ is a left [[exact functor]], or a functor that preserves finite limits (also called a _lex_ functor, a _cartesian_ functor, or a _finitely continuous_ functor). A functor preserves finite limits if and only if:

* it preserves terminal objects, binary products, and equalizers; or
* it preserves terminal objects and binary pullbacks.

Since these conditions frequently come up individually, it may be worthwhile listing them separately: 

* $F: C \to D$ **preserves terminal objects** if $F(t_C)$ is terminal in $D$ whenever $t_C$ is terminal in $C$; 

* $F: C \to D$ **preserves binary products** if the pair of maps 
$$F(c) \stackrel{F(\pi_1)}{\leftarrow} F(c \times d) \stackrel{F(\pi_2)}{\to} F(d)$$ 
exhibits $F(c \times d)$ as a product of $F(c)$ and $F(d)$, where $\pi_1: c \times d \to c$ and $\pi_2: c \times d \to d$ are the product projections in $C$; 

* $F: C \to D$ **preserves equalizers** if the map 
$$F(i): F(e) \to F(c)$$ 
is the equalizer of $F(f), F(g): F(c) \stackrel{\to}{\to} F(d)$, whenever $i: e \to c$ is the equalizer of $f, g: c \stackrel{\to}{\to} d$ in $C$.
