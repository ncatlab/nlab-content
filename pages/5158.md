## Definitions

There are several things that one might mean by a "(possibly [[weak homotopy equivalence|weak]]) [[homotopy equivalence]] of [[toposes]] (or [[(∞,1)-toposes]])."   Some candidates are:

1. A [[geometric morphism]] that induces an [[equivalence]] of the [[fundamental ∞-groupoid of a locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos]], or more generally of [[shape of an (∞,1)-topos|shapes]].

1. A geometric morphism which induces an isomorphism on all [[nonabelian cohomology]] with coefficients in [[constant ∞-stacks]].

1. A geometric morphism which induces an [[isomorphism]] on all [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] with coefficients in [[locally constant sheaves|locally constant]] sheaves (of complexes) of [[abelian groups]] (the most classical notion).

1. A geometric morphism which has an inverse up to "homotopy" in the classical sense of a map $E\times [0,1]\to F$, where since $E$ and $F$ are toposes, we have to incarnate $[0,1]$ as the topos $Sh([0,1])$.

Of these, the first three are arguably a notion of *weak* homotopy equivalence.

## Relationship between definitions.

The first two definitions are equivalent, since (viewing a topos $E$ equivalently as the $(\infty,1)$-topos of sheaves on the same [[site]], if necessary), a constant ∞-stack on $E$ is one of the form $LConst A$ for an ∞-groupoid $A$, and the cohomology of $E$ with coefficients in $LConst A$ is just $\pi_0(Hom_E(*,LConst A))$.  But when $E$ is locally $\infty$-connected, $\Pi_E$ is left adjoint to $LConst$, so this is the same as $\pi_0 Hom_{\infty Gpd}(\Pi_E(*),A) = Hom_{Ho(\infty Gpd)}(\Pi_\infty(E),A)$ by definition of $\Pi_\infty(E)$.  Thus, by the Yoneda lemma, a map of toposes induces an equivalence of fundamental ∞-groupoids, i.e. an isomorphism in $Ho(\infty Gpd)$, iff it induces an isomorphism on all such cohomology.

These first two definitions also imply the third, since locally constant stacks on $E$ are represented by maps out of $\Pi_\infty(E)$, and the abelian cohomology $H^n(E,A)$ with coefficients in an abelian sheaf $A$ can be identified with nonabelian cohomology in the locally constant stack $B^n A$ which is the $n$-fold [[delooping]] of $A$.

[[Mike Shulman]]: I believe I recall the converse of that is true as well.  Maybe it is in Artin-Mazur?  I also seem to recall that the last notion of a "paths homotopy equivalence" implies the first few.

## Adjunctions induce homotopy equivalences

One important thing to note is that any [[adjunction]] in the [[2-category]] [[Topos]] induces a homotopy equivalence in any of the above senses.  For the first (hence also the second) sense, we just observe that $\Pi_\infty$ is 2-functorial, whereas it lands in the (&infin;,1)-category &infin;Gpd where all 2-morphisms are invertible; hence adjunctions get sent to adjunctions, which are necessarily equivalences.

For the third, we note that has [[weighted limit|tensors]] with the [[interval category]], that are given by [[cartesian product]] with sheaves on the [[Sierpinski space]] $\Sigma$.  Thus, a natural transformation between two geometric morphisms $E\to F$ is the same as a single geometric morphism 
$E\times Sh(\Sigma)\to F$.  Now just pick a map $[0,1]\to \Sigma$ that doesn't identify the endpoints, like the classifying map of $[0,\frac1 2]$, to get an actual "homotopy" between the same two geometric morphisms.  Hence, any 2-morphism in $Topos$ gives a homotopy, so any adjunction gives a homotopy equivalence.

In particular, this means that any [[local geometric morphism]] or [[totally connected geometric morphism]] is a homotopy equivalence.
