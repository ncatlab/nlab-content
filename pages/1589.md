## Schweigert: CFT and algebra in braided tensor categories, I##


### 1. Modular tensor categories and rational CFT ###

#### 1.1 ####

* consider a _rational semisimple conformal vertex algebra_ $V$ 

* $\to$ from this we get a representation category $C$, which is a 
  [[braided monoidal category]]

  * that $V$ is semisimple and rarional makes $C$ in fact a [[modular tensor category]]

* $\to$ this gives rise to conformal blocks

**Definition: modular tensor category**

* abelian, $\mathbb{C}$-linear, semi-simple tensor category

* the tensor unit is a simple object, $I$ 
  a finite set of representatives of isomorphism classes of simple objects

* ribbon category, in particular objects have duals

* a non-degeneracy condition on the braiding given by an isomorphism of algebras
  $$
    K(C) \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} End(Id_C)
  $$
  where
  $$
    [U] \mapsto \alpha_U
  $$
  where the transformation $\alpha_U$ is given on the simple object $V$ by
  $$
    \alpha_U(V) = straight V-line encircled by U-loop
  $$
  (on the right we use string diagram notation)


#### 1.2 ####

**Fact (Reshitikhin-Turaev)** for any modula tensor category
$C$ there is a monoidal functor
$$
  tft_C : cobord_{3,2}^C \to vect_f(\mathcal{C})
$$ 

* 1) factorization homomorphism: given a surface $\Sigma_{U,U^*}$ with two marked points labeled by $U$ and $U^*$ consider the 3d cobordism from $\Sigma$ to the result of gluing a handle
to $\Sigma$ that connects the two marked points with a $U$-line running inside the handle.
the corresponding linear map given by the tft
$$
 fact_U := tft_C(\Sigma_{U,U^*} \to \Sigma)
$$
we have 
* 
$$
   \oplus_{i \in I} fact_{U_i} 
   : 
   \oplus_{i \in I} tft_C(\Sigma_{U,U^*})
   \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
   tft_C(X)
  $$

* a representation of the mapping class group $Map(\Sigma)$ on $tft_C(X)$


### 2. CFT correlator ###

#### 2.1 ####


* $X$ a 2-dimensional conformal manifold, either oriented or unoriented
without boundary

* for the purpose of this talk restrict to the oriented case (but unoriented
case has been dealt with, too)

* also, from now on $X$ regarded just as a topological surface, no longer a
conformal one

#### 2.2 ####


strategy

* decorate $X$

* appropriate spaces of "functions" for correlators

**holomorphic factorization**

* pass from $X$ to its $\mathbb{Z}_2$ _orientation bundle_ $\hat X$,
the _orientation double cover_ (identifying points on the boundary, though) 
(an orientation twisted version of what is called the __double__ )

* double accounts for what physicists call left- and rightmoving
degrees of freedom

**goal**

* 1) find a decoration for $X$ such that $\hat X \in cobord_{3,2}^C$

* 2) specify the correlator $Cor(X) \in tft_C(\hatt X)$

  * a) $Cor(X)$ invariant under $Map(\hat X)^{\mathbb{Z}_2}$
    **modular invariance**
    
  * b) compatibility with factorization homomorphism (technical to state, dropped here)


#### 2.3 ####

**Insight.** decoration bicategory of special symmetric Frobenius algebras in $C$

* Frobenius algebra in $C$: an object
  $$
    (A \in Obj(C), \eta : 1 \to A,\epsilon : A \to 1,  
    m : A \otimes A \to A, \Delta : A \to A \otimes A)
  $$
  which is a unital associative algebra and counital coassociative coalgebra 
  in $C$ 

* being Frobenius means that the coproduct 
  $\Delta : A \to A \otimes A$ is a homomorphism of $A$-bimodules

* being _symmetric_ means that the two obvious nontriviall morphisms $A \to A^*$
  that one can build using unit and counit are equal

* being special means that $m \circ \Delta = Id_A$ and $\epsilon \circ \eta = dim(A) Id_1$


#### 2.4 ####

A typical worldsheet $X$: higher genus surface with defect lines and
marked points drawn on it

**decoration**

* to 2-dimensional cells assign special symmetric Frobenius algebras $A$;

* to 1-dimensional cells

  * to boundary lines a left or right module over the respective Frobenius algebra 
    (boundary is oriented);
  
  * to a defect line: a bimodule over the respective Frobenius algebras

* to 0-dimensional cells

  * to a junction of three defect lines labeled by three bimodules $D_i$, associate
    an element in $Hom_{A_1| A_3}(D_1 \otimes_{A_2} D_2, D_3)$
    
  * boundary field insertions: 
    for marked point on the boundary $x \in \partial X$ 
    attach a simple object $U \in Obj(C)$ to a marked point
    on a given defect line (or rather, on a junction of two defect lines) and an 
    element in $Hom_A(D_1 \otimes U, D_2)$

  * bulk field insertion: for $x$ not in the boundary but in the inside of $X$,
    consider the two preimages in $\hat X$, assign simple objects $U, V$ to these,
    respectively and assign an element in
    $$
      Hom_{A_1|A_2}(U \otimes A_1 \otimes V, A_2)
    $$

  * here the bimodule structure on these tensor products are given by over- and
    underbraiding, respectively (depending on orientation)


#### 2.5 ####

correlators from cobordisms

given $X$ consider the cobordism from the empty surface

$$
  \emptyset \stackrel{M_X}{\to} \hat X
$$
given by
$$
  M_X = (\hat X \times [-1,1])/_{\sigma t \sim -t}
$$
and set
$$
  Cor(X) = tft_C(M_X) 1  \in tft_C(\hat H)
$$

**Example** 

$X$ the disk with a defect line running across it from boundary to boundary.

then

* $\hat X$ is the sphere

* $M_X$ is the 3-ball

* $X$ sits inside the equatorial plane of $M_X$: one copy of $[-1,1]$ over each of
  its interior points connectint its two preimages in $\hat X$, in addtion one copy of 
  the interval connecting each boundary point to its unique preimage in $\hat X$


>long discussion with audience ensues: audience wants to better understand why
all these constructions are being undertaken. The answer is in the theorem to come:
every assignment of correlators as above (compatible with factorization morphism and
invariant in the above sense under mapping class group (preserving defect decoration))
is obtained by the recipe presented here


## Runkel: CFT and modular tensor categories, II##

* Ingo Runkel, Monday morning 11.15. CFT and algebra in braided tensor categories II; notes by [[Bruce Bartlett]]: [[talk2.pdf:file]]


## Freed ##

joint work with [[Jacques Distler]] and Greg Moore.

(on [[differential cohomology]] of background fields in type II [[string theory]], in particular on [[orientifold]] backgrounds)

* $\Sigma$ in this talk a compact 2-dimensional manifold: the _worldsheet_

  * (called $X$ in the morning talks)

* $X$ smooth 10-dimensional manifold: _spacetime_

* fields $\Sigma \stackrel{\phi}{\to} X$ (see [[sigma-model]] )

* 2-dimensional theory $\to$ 10-dimensional theory 

* more generally: $X$ is an [[orbifold]]

* today: a variation of this called _orientiold_ : $X_W \to X$ is a double cover

  * physicists think of $X_W$ as the spacetime equipped with an involution, 
    but really spacetime is the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-quotient $X$
    
* I) $\sigma \in \mathbb{Z}_2$ acts trivially : _type I string_

* II) section $X_W \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\to} X$ _type II string theory_

this project started when Jacques Distler showed Dan Freed a certain formula, namely

let 
$$
  i : F \hookrightarrow  X_w
$$
be the fixed point

* set 
  $$
    RR-charge = \pm 2^{something} i_*
    ( \sqrt{\frac{L'(F)}{L'(\nu)}} )
  $$
  where
  $$
    L' = \prod \frac{x/4 u}{tanh x/4u}
  $$
  where 
  * $u$ is the Bott generator of K-theory
  * $\nu$ is normal bundle of $F \hookrightarrow X_W$
  * with another factor this would be the Hrizebruch 
      L-function, this way it is not

what is it?

this led to thinking about the following
 
* 1) definition of fields/theory

* 2) derive RR-charge formula over $\mathbb{Z}[1/2]$ from $10 d$

* 3) anomaly cancellation in 2d

* there is paper on arXiv with a summary, but this is still work in progress  

diff geoemtric structures that one needs to make sense of this:

* differential cohomology

* twistings


### differential cohomology ###

suppose $h$ is any cohomology theory

then $h$ with rational coefficients $h(-; \mathbb{Q}) = H(-;h(pt, \mathbb{Q}))^\bullet$

here the coefficient object 

$$
  h_Q := h(pt;\mathbb{Q})
$$

on the right is a graded ring and the bulleted-degree is the
corresponding total degree of that and the cohomology degree


consider the [[homotopy limit]] which gives [[differential cohomology]]

$$
  \array{
    h^{v \bullet} &\to& \Omega(M, h_{\mathbb{R}})_{closed}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    h^\bullet(M) &\to& H(M; h_{\mathbb{R}})
  }
$$

>question from Mike Hopkins: are there choices in the bottom horizontal map; doesn't one 
have to choose a basis of cocycles?
  
we get from this two exact sequences

$$
  0 \to h(M;h_{\mathbb{R}} \otimes \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})^{q-1}
  \stackrel{curv}{\to}\Omega(M;h_{\mathbb{R}})^q_{\mathbb{Z}} \to 0
$$  

$$
  0 \to forms \to h^{v \bullet}(M) \to h^q(M) \to 0
$$

* this was introduced for ordinary cohomology by Cheeger and Simons and generalized by
Hopkins and Singer

* we can think of the cohomology group as components of some space
  $$
    h^q(M) = \pi_0(Map(M, h_q))
  $$
  and
  $$
    h^{v q}(M) = \pi_0(--)
  $$
  
* various people constructed various models for this, such as Bunke and Schick;
  by Gomi for equivariant cohomology, also Szabo and Alessandro
  
**examples**

$$
    H^{v 1}(M) = Map(M, \mathbb{T})
$$
  
$$
    H^{1}(M) = \pi_0 Map(M, \mathbb{T})
$$

$$
    H^{v 2}(M) = \{line bundles with connection\}
$$

$$
    H^{v 3}(M) = \{line bundle gerbes with connection\}
$$

**remarks**

* the application to string theory here will have completely topological flavor

* defining certain terms in an action like Wess-Zumino-Witten  term and chern-Simons term, these are nicely understood in terms of differential cohomology: observation goes back to Gawedzki

* in physics the forms are "currents" which say where charges are located, the class in real cohomology is the total charge

* in quantum physics this total charge has to be quantized (sit on a lattice inside the real cohomology)

* so the above pullback diagram says that classical charges are to be combined with quantization condition in order to give physical fields



### twistings of $KR(X_w)$ ###

so consider again $\pi : X_w \to X$ a double cover

* an object in $KR^0(X_W)$ is represented by 

  * a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded complex
vector bundle $E \to X_W$ (in terms of pseudobundles: even part minus odd part)

  * $\tilde \sigma : \sigma^* \bar E \to E$

recall that $\sigma$ may have fixedpoints

special cases

* $\sigma$ acts trivially: we get just $KO^0(X_w)$-theory

* $X_w \to X$ has a section: $K^0(X)$ 

**twisting**

pass to a locally equivalent groupoid

$$
  Y_W \to Y 
$$

$$
  Y : (Y_0  \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\leftarrow} Y_1 \stackrel{\stackrel{\leftarrow}{\leftarrow}}{\leftarrow}
 \cdots)
$$

notation: $V^\phi = $ $V$ if $\phi = 0$ and $\bar V$ otherwise

**definition**

a twsiting of $KR(X_W)$ is an equivalent thing $Y_w \to Y$ as above

where 

$$
  d : Y_0 \to \mathbb{Z}
$$
continuous

$$
  L \to Y_1
$$
hermitian line bundle, $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded

$$
  \theta: L_g^{\phi(f)} \otimes L_f \to L_{g f}
$$

cocycle condition for $\theta$


recognize these twistings as classified by some cohomology theory

**cohomology group**

For $K(X)$:  $\pi_{\{0,1,2,3\}h \simeq \{\mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Z}_2, 0 , \mathbb{Z}\}$

for some $h$ that we are not being told about

For $KO(X_W)$: $\pi_{\{0,1,2\}} k_{0 \lt 0..2\gt} \simeq \{\mathbb{Z},  \mathbb{Z}_2, \mathbb{Z}_2\}$

for $KR(X_W)$ the iso classes are

$$
  H^0(X, \mathbb{Z}) \times H^1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \times
   H^{w+3}(X, \mathbb{Z})
$$ 

as a set

$$
  u \in K^2(pt) \in KR^{\tau_1 +2}(pt)
$$

>speaker is running out of time, coherence is being lost a bit... notetaker misses to take notes on some central statement on these twisted cohomology classes, but see the arXiv article


### string backgrounds ###

the differential cocycles are background data for the 2-d theory and 
field data for the 10 d theory (see [[sigma-model]])

**def** an NS-NS superstring background is

* i) a smooth 10d orbifold with metruc and real function (dilaton field)

* ii) $\pi : X_W \to X$ orientifold double cover

* iii) $\beta^v$ a differential twisting of $KR(X_w)$: the $B$-field

* iv) K : $R(\beta) \to \tau^{KO}(T X -2)$ iso of twistings of $KO(X)$: twisted Spin-structure

Bott shift, leading to equivalent theories $\beta^v \to \beta^v + (\tau^v + 2)$

and something else

Stiefel-Whitney classes
$$
  w_1(X) = t w
$$
$$
  w_2(X) =  t w^2 + a w 
$$

aim: mix iii) and iv)

2d theory: A worldsheet  $\Sigma$ with metric,
a spin structure on $\hat \Sigma$: the orientation double cover



$$
  \array{
     \hat \Sigma &\to& X_w
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \Sigma &\to& X
  }
$$

$$
  \phi^* w \simeq \hat w
$$

and spme spinor fields on $\hat \Sigma$

in the [[path integral]]: integrate over all of these pieces of data

$\to$ effective action Pfaffian of Dirac operator 

$$
  Pfaff  D_{\hat \Sigma}(\phi^*T X - 2)
  \cdot
    exp 2 \pi i \int_{\Sigma/S} \phi^* \beta^v
$$

Pfaffian bit is section of a Pfaffian line bundle over $S$

where?


work over some parameter space $S$

both factors above are sections of a line bundle over $S$

**theorem** (in preparation) there is a hopefully canonical
trivialization of $L_\Psi \otimes L_B \to S$

action being section of bundle instead of function: annomaly: 

sources

* 1) integrals over fermions $L_\Psi$: spin structure need not be equivariant under $\mathbb{Z}_2$-action

* 2) simultaneous electric and magnetic current or alternatively self-dual current

interply between 1 and 2 leads to anomaly cancellation

* 3) boundary of topological terms, like WZW, Chern-Simons

what about $L_B$: exotic orientation



## Kevin Costello;  part I ##


### deformation quantization ###

* classical mechanics: $A^{cl}$ commutative algebra with 
Poisson brackets $\{-,-\}$

* this is the classical observable algebra

* to quantize this we need to find some associative algebra
  $A^q$ over the ring $\mathbb{R}[\![\hbar]\!]$

* such that 

  * 1) $A^q/\hbar A^q = A^cl$ 

  * 2) if $a,b \in A^c{l}$, $\tilde a, \tilde b$ are lifts in $A^q$ then
    $$
      \{a,b\} = \frac{1}{\hbar} [\tilde a, \tilde b] mod \hbar
    $$
    
**goal** of these lectures: want to give an analog of ths picture for QFT

* 1) need to explain wha plays the role of commutative, Poisson and 
  associative algebras
  
* 2) explain how classical field theory is encoded in commutative and Poisson

* 3) explain how to quantize

structure that play the role of associative algebras is a 
[[factorization algebra]] 

this is a $C^\infty$-analog (i.e. differential geometric analog) 
of a **chiral algebra** in the sense of
Beilinson and Drinfeld

* let $M$ be a manifold (on which we do QFT)

* Let $B(M) = \{smooth balls in M\}$; this is an $\infty$-dim manifold


>audience: would open balls here form a manifold? does it matter?
  >answer: well, really we don't think of manifolds but of [[diffeological space]]s, of course (sheaves on manifold)

* Let $B_n(M) = \{n disjoint smooth balls embedded in larger ball in M\}$

there are obvious projection maps

$$
  B(M) \stackrel{q}{\leftarrow} B_n(M) \stackrel{p}{\to} B(M)^n
$$

everything now joint work with O. Gwilliam


**def** A **factorization algebra** is

* a [[vector bundle]] $F$ on $B(M)$  

  * equipped with maps $p^*(F^{\times n}) \to q^*(F)$ 
  
    * satisfying some evident compatibility condition
    
    * such that everything is invariant under the obvious $S_n$-action on 
      $B_n(M)$ that exchanges the order of the balls
* concretely: 

  * $F$ assigns a vector space to every ball $B \subset M$
  
  * if we have some configuration of balls, like 2 balls $B_1, B_2$ inside a big one $B_3$
    we get a map $F(B_1)\otimes F(B_2) \to F(B_3)$
    
  * these must vary smoothly as the configuration of the balls varies
 

This is an algebra over the embedded little disk [[operad]], which is a 
"colored operad" (i.e. a [[multicategory]] with more than one object)

* where the colors are $B(M)$

* $n$-ary operations are $B_n(M)$ 

* with extra conditions such that the vector space we assign to each color forms a smooth vector bundle

  * and all operad maps are compatible with this

notice that it happenss that for given in and out colors, there is at least one
morphism in the operad.

* there are several different reductions of this structure that are more familiar

* notion of [[vector bundle]] comes in three natural flavors

  * 1) $C^\infty$
  
  * 2) holomorphic
  
  * 3) locally constant sheaves
  
* definition of factorization algebra can be modified to the case of 2) and 3)


**def** a locally constant factorization algebra is like a factorization algebra,
except that instead of being a vector bundle $F$ is a locally constant sheaf on $B(M)$
of co[[chain complex]]es
and the structure maps of locally constant sheaves

>question: cohomologically locally constant or really locally constant

  > answer: I think cohomologically locally constant
  
let $F$ be a locally constant factorization algebra in $\mathbb{R}^n$, then 
since $B(\mathbb{R}^n)$ is contractible $F$ is quasi-isomorphic to a
trivial sheaf with fiber $V$ a cochain complex

so then for instance the map $V__{B_1} \otimes V_{B_2}  \to V_{B_3}$
depends only on homotopies of the configuration,

so, a locally constant factorization algebra on $\mathbb{R}^n$ is an 
$E_n$-[[algebra over an operad|algebra]]

next specialization: **holomorphic factorization algebras**

Let $\Sigma$ be a Riemannian surface.

We know what it means for a map from a complex manifold to $B(M)$ to be
holomorphic; so we can talk about holomorphic algebras on $B(\Sigma)$

a homomorphic map $U \to B(M)$ is a bundle $M \to U$ all of whose fibers are balls
and a map
$$
  \array{
    M &\to& \Sigma
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    U
  }
$$

actually $B(M)$, too, is also not a complex manifold but a sheaf on complex manifold

>Andre Henriquez: but with this definition, won't every map $U \to B(M)$ be holomorphic:
  > answer: oops, right
  
??

let's consider a holomorphic factorization algebra on $\mathcal{C}$, which is
translation invariant and dilation invariant

let $V = F$ (any round disk)

if we have a configuratoin of disks with $B_1$ and $B_2$ in $B_3$ with radii
$\epsilon_i$ with one disk in the center of the big one and the other at
complex parameter $z$, the map
$$
  m_z : V \otimes V \to V
$$
must vary holomorphically with $z$

so $z \mapsto m_z$ is a holomorphic map $Annulus \to Hom(V \otimes V, V)$, so it has 
a Laurent expansion

$$
  m_z \sim \sum_{k \in \mathbb{Z}} Z^k a_k
$$

with $a_k$ in some completion of $Hom(V \otimes V , V)$

>question by Ulrich Bunke: algebraic tensor product or not?
  > answer: no, in examples tensor product will be projective tensor product
  
reminiscent of vertex operator algebra

notice that Beilinson-Drinfeld make the same def in the algebraic setting, in their
case the axioms are equivalent to that of a vertex operator algebra;

they show axioms for chiral algebra on $\mathcal{C}$ are essentially equivalent
to those of a vertex operator algebra


**claim**: structure of factorization algebra: good to encode quantum field theory

notice that factorizations algebras on real line tend to be associativ algebras,
so that fits in with the expectation from quantum mechanics.

## Schick: differential cohomology ##


smooth cohomology

* idea:

  * combine cohomology + differential forms
  
main diagram


$$
  \array{
    \hat H(M) &\stackrel{I}{\to}& H^\bullet(M)
    \\
    \downarrow^{R} && \downarrow
    \\
    \Omega^\bullet_{d=0}(M)
    &\stackrel{}{\to}&
    H^\bullet_{dR}(M)
    \simeq H^\bullet(M,\mathbb{R})
  }
$$

so differential cohomology $\hat H^\bullet(M)$ combines the ordinary cohomology $H^\bullet(M)$
with a differential form representative of its image in real cohomology.

* $I$ projects a differential cohomology to its underlying ordinary cohomology class;

* $R$ send the differential cohomology class to its __curvature_ differential form data

we want an exact sequence

$$
 \array{
   H^{\bullet-1}(M)
   &\stackrel{ch}{\to}&
   \Omega^{\bullet-1}(M)/{im(d)}
   &\stackrel{d}{\to}&
   \hat H(M) 
   &\stackrel{I}{\to}& 
   H^\bullet(M) \to 0
   \\
   &&&
   {}_{d}\searrow
   &
   \downarrow^R
   \\
   &&&&
   \Omega^\bullet_{d=0}(M)
 }
$$

**definition**

Given cohomology theory $E^\bullet$, a smooth refinement
$\hat E^\bullet$ is a functor $\hat E : Diff \to Grps$
with transformations $I, R$ such that 

$$
  \array{
    \hat E(M) &\stackrel{I}{\to}& E^\bullet(M)
    \\
    \downarrow^{R} && \downarrow
    \\
    \Omega^\bullet_{d=0}(M, V)
    &\stackrel{}{\to}&
    E^\bullet_{dR}(M)
    \simeq E^\bullet(M,\mathbb{R})
  }
$$

where 

$V = E^\bullet(pt)\otimes \mathbb{R}$

is the graded non-torsion cohomology of $E$ on the point. So now all the
gradings above denote total grading.

and such that there is a transformation

$$
  a : \Omega^{\bullet -1}(M)/{im(d)}
  \to
  \hat E^*(M)
$$

that gives the above kind of exact sequence


**definition**

if $E^*$ is multiplicative, we say $\hat E^*$ is multiplicative with 
product $\vee$
if $\hat E$ takes values in graded rings and the transformations are
compatible with multiplicative structure, where

$$
  a(\omega) \vee x = a(\omega \wedge R(x))
$$

**definition**

$\hat E$ has $S^1$-integration if there is a natural (in $M$) transformation

$$
  \int : \hat E^*(M \times S^1) \to \hat E^{\bullet -1}(M)
$$

compatible with $\int$ of forms  and for $E$ it is given by the suspension isomorphism

and

$$
  \int \circ p^* = 0
$$

for $p : M \times S^1 \to M$ and

$$
  \int \circ (  id \times (z \mapsto \bar z) )^* = - \int
$$


**remark** ordinary cohomology theories are supposed to be homotopy
invariant, but differential forms are not, so in general the differential
cohomology is not


**Lemma** Given $\hat E$ a smooth cohomology theory. 
The **homotopy formula**:

given $h : M \times [0,1] \stackrel{smooth}{\to} N$
a smooth homotopy we have

$$
  h^*_1(X) - h^*_0(X)
  =
  a( \int_{M \times [0,1]/M}  h^*(R(x)))
$$

**corollary** $ker(R)$ (i.e. flat cohomology) is a homotopy invariant
functor

**def** $\hat _H{flat} := ker(R)$

**proof of lemma**

suffices to show 

$$
  \iota_1^*(x) - \iota_0^*(x) = a(\int_{M\times [0,1]/M} R(x))
$$

for all $x \in \hat E(M \times [0,1])$

observe if $x = p^* y$ the left hand side vanishes, $\int R(p^* y) = 0$

for general $x$ $\exists y \in \jhat E(M)$; $x - p^*(y) = a (\omega)$
$\omega \in \Omega(M \times [0,1])$

Stokes' theorem gives $i^*_1 \omega - i^*_0 \omega = \int_{[0,1]} d \omega$
$= \int R(a(\omega)) = \int R(x-p^* \omega) = \int R(x)$

on the other hand

$$
  i^*_1(x) - i^*_0(x) = i^*_1(a(\omega))
    - i^*_0(a(\omega))
    = a(\int R(x))
$$

a calculation: $\hat H^1_{flat}(pt) = \hat H^1(pt) = \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z} = \hat K^1(pt)$

**Theorem (Hopkins-Singer)**

For each generalized cohomology theory $E^*$ 
a differential version  $\hat E^*$ as in the above definition does exist

Moreover $\hat E_{flat}^* = E \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}^{\bullet -1}$

**remark** it's not evident hot to obtain more structure like multiplication

**theorem** using geometric models, multiplicative smooth extensions
with $S^1$-integration are constructed for

* K-theory (Bunke-Schick)

* MU-bordisms (unitary bordisms)  
  (Bunke-Schr&ouml;der-Schick-Wiethaupts; and from there Landweber exact cohomology theories)
  

**uniqueness theorem (Bunke-Schick)** 
(Simons-Sullivan proved this for ordinary integral cohomology)

assume $E^*$ is _rationally even_, meaning that

$$
  E^k(pt)\otimes \mathbb{Q} = 0 \;\; for odd k 
$$

plus one further technical assumption

then any two smooth extensions $\hat E^*$, $\tilde E^*$ are naturally
isomorphic

such that if required to be compatible with integration the ismorphism is unique

if $\hat E, \tilde E$ are multiplicative, then this isomorphism is,
as well.

**example** if we don't require compatibility with $S^1$-integration, then there
are "exotic" abelian group structures on $\hat K^1$

## Bunke: smooth K-theory ##

(I gave up taking notes in that one, maybe somebody else
has notes?)


## Costello, part II ##

alternative to yesterday's axioms:

replace $B(M)$ by $Embeddings(\bar D^n, M)$

and replace $B_n(M)$ by

$$
  Embed(D^n, M) \times Enb(\bar D^n \coprod \cdots \coprod \bar D^n, \bar D^n)
$$

* what is the classical analog of a factorization algebra?

* and how do we get classical QFT?

**basic idea**

factorization algebras form a symmetric monoidal category

so we can look at [[algebra over an operad]] in the category of factorization
algebras

if $F, F'$ are factorization algebras, then
$$
  (F\otimes F')(B) = F(B) \otimes F'(B)
$$

**def** a **classical factorization algebra** is a commutative algebra
in the category of factorization algebras


recall, an $E_\infty$ object in $E_n$-algebras is an $E_\infty$-algebra

idea of how to associate a classical factorization algebra to a classical field
theory is as follows

suppose we have classical field theory, e.g. space of fields is
section of a vector bundle $E \to M$

$$
  S : \Gamma(M,E) \to \mathbb{R}
$$

is the classical action

$S$ is local: obtained by $int$ of a Lagrangian

if $B  \subset M$ is a ball, let

$$
  EL(B) = 
  \left\{
    \phi \in \Gamma(interior(B), E)
    such that \phi satisfies Euler-Lagrange equations
  \right\}
$$

>Freed: notice that you are doing here classical QFT in Euclidean signature
>Costello: yes

**rough idea** 

the classical factorization algebra $X_S$ associated to $S$ 
assigns to $B$, the algebra 

$$
  O(EL(B))
$$

of functions on the set of solutions to $EL$.

we want maps

$$
  X_S(B_1) \otimes \cdots \otimes X_S(B_n)
  \to
  X_S(B_{n+1})
$$

for $B_i$ in $B_{n+1}$

we have a map 

$$
  EL(B_{n+1}) \to EL(B_1)\times \cdots \times EL(B_n)
$$

this yields a map

$$
  O(EL(B_1)) \otimes \cdots \otimes O(EL(B_{n+1}))
$$

as desried

**simple example**

fields are $C^\infty$ functions on $M$

$$
  S(\phi) := \int_M \phi \Delta \phi
$$

Euler-Lagrange equation is $\Delta \phi = 0$

$$
  EL(B) = \{Harmonic functions on the interior of B\}
$$

$$
  O(EL(B)) = \prod_{n \geq 0} Hom(EL(B)^{\otimes n}, \mathbb{R})^{S_n}
$$

where Hom means continuous linear maps, and where $\otimes$ is the completed
tensor product

later, for more complex examples, what we really want to do is
to take the _derived_ space of EL solutions

**question**

Why does this classical factorization algebra want to become just a
factorization algebra?

recall that fact-algebras form a symmetric monoidal category

the $E_0$-[[operad]] is defined by 

* $E_0(n) = \emptyset$ for $n \geq 1$

* $E_0(0) = pt$

so for instance an $E_0$-algebra in $Vect$ is a vector space with an element

forgot to mention that factorization algebras need to have a unit,
a section $F$ on $B(M)$ which is a unit for the product

So: an $E_0$-algebra in factorization algebras is just a factorization algebra




$$

    E_2-algebras
     \\
     graded comm algebra with Poisson bracket of deg -2
    &\stackrel{quantize}{\to}& 
    E_3-algebras
  }
$$

Beilinson and Drinfeld define an operad over (i.e. in the category of
cochain complex moudles over) the ring of formal power
series over $\hbar$
$$
  \mathbb{R}[\![\hbar]\!]
$$

as follows:

* generated by $\cdot$, a commutative product

* $\{-,-\}$ a Poisson bracket of deg +1

* with differential $d(-) = \hbar \{-,-\}$

call this the **BD operad**

$$
  BD/\hbar BD = operad of commutative algebras with \{-,-\} of deg +1
$$

$$
  H_\bullet(BD(n) \otimes_{\mathbb{R}[\![\hbar]\!]} \mathbb{R}(\hbar))  = 0
$$

so 

$$
  BD \otimes_{\mathbb{R}[\![\hbar]\!]} \mathbb{R}[\![\hbar]\!]
  \simeq E_0
$$

**rant on [[BV-theory]] termionology**

framed $E_2$, which is often called the _BV-operad_ 
has **nothing** to do with the [[BV-theory]]


instead: the BD-operad from above is the one related to [[BV-theory]]

**def** the $P_0$ (or $Poisson_0$) operad is the operad
of commutative Poisson algebras with $\{-,-\} of deg 1$

so $P_0 = BD/\hbar$

**general fact**

let $M$ be a manifold, and $f : M \to \mathbb{R}$ a function, then
$O(derived critical locus of f)$ is a $P_0$-operad

derived critical locus has as functions the [[differential graded algebra]]


$$
  \cdots 
   \Gamma(M,\Lambda^2 T M)
  \stackrel{\vee d f}{\to}
   \Gamma(M,\Lambda^ T M)
  \stackrel{\vee d f}{\to}
   O(M)
  =
  \Gamma(M, \Lambda^\bullet T M)
$$


here $\Lambda^k T M $ is in degree $-k$ with differential $\vee d f$

$$
  \Gamma(M, \Lambda^\bullet T M)
$$

has Schouten bracket, which is of degree +1

This "wants to become" $E_0$

**observation** if $M$ has a [[measure]], then 
$O(crit^n(f))$ has a canonical quantization to an 
algebra over $BD$.

then quantization is

$$
  \Gamma(M, \Lambda^\bullet T M), \vee d f + \hbar \Delta
$$


here $\Delta$ arises whenever $M$ has a measure

$$
  \Delta X = Div X
$$

$$
  X \in \Gamma(M, T M)
$$



## Costello, part III ##

so recall that the derived critical locis if a function is a $P_0$-algebra,
so it wants to quantize to $E_0$

if we have a classical field theory, the derived space of 
solutions to EL yields a $P_0$ algebra in factorizatoin algebra

so it wants to become a factorization algebra

**Example** $\phi \in C^\infty(M)$, $S(\phi) = \int \phi \Delta \phi$

derived space of solutions to EL is the complex

$$
 \array{
  C^\infty(M) &\stackrel{\Delta}{\to}&
    C^\infty(M)
  \\
    0 && 1
 }
$$

if $B \subset M$ is a ball, then

$$
  O(EL^n(B))
  =
  \Pi_{n \geq 0}(
     Hom( C^\infty(int B) \stackrel{\Delta}{\to} C^\infty(int B))^{\otimes n},
     \mathbb{R}
  )^{S_n}
$$

this is a commutative dga and defines a commutative factorizaton algebra

if we add an interaction term to the action functional

$$
  S(\phi)
  =
  \int \phi \Delta \phi + \phi^3
$$

then we get the same algebra of functions but the differential changes

in Yang-Mills theory with gauge Lie algebra $g$: 
first, we consider the derived quotient of
$\Omega^1(M)\otimes g$ by $\Omega^0(M)\otimes g$, then, take derived critical
locus of YM action

What we get, when linearized looks like

$$
  (
  \array{
     \Omega^0(M) &\to& \Omega^1(M) &\stackrel{d \star d}{\to}& \Omega^3(M)
       &\stackrel{}{\to}& \Omega^4(M)
     \\
     -1 && 0 && 1 && 2
  }) \otimes g
$$

the algebra of functions iss 
$$
  \Pi_{n \geq 0} Hom(E^{\otimes n}; \mathbb{R})^{S_n}
$$

with diffeential including YM action

**theorem**
if we take the derived space of solutions to the EL equations,
looking infinitesimally near a fixed solution, then we find
a $P_0$-algebra internal to factorization algebras on $M$

this amounts to quantizing the action $S$ into a solution
of the quantum master equation

this requires machinery of counter-terms, Wilsonian effective 
actions, to even define the quantum master equation

>see Kevin Costello's book linked to on hos website for details

**theorem** (joint with O. Gwilliam)

("wave" version)

conssider the scalar field theory, with an action of the form

$$
  S(\phi) = \int \phi (\Delta \phi + m^2 \phi)
  + arbitrary local higher terms
$$ 

use the above theorem, around the 0-solution

Let $X_S$ be the classical factorization algebra associated to it
(it is a $P_0$-algebra)

Let $Q^{(n)}(X_S)$ be the set of quantizations

= $\{lifts of $X_S$ to an algebra over BD/{\hbar^{n+1}}\}$

there is a sequence $T^{(n)} \to T^{(n-1)} \to \cdots \to T^{(1)} \to pt$

where $T^{(n)}$ maps to $Q^{(n)}(X_S)$, so that the obvious diagram commutes

where $T^{(n)} \to T^{(n-1)}$ is a torsor for the abelian group of local
functions of the field $\phi$

so $T^{(\infty)} = lim_n T^n$ then

$$
  T^{(\infty)} \simeq \{\sum_{k \geq 1} \hbar^k S^{(k)}\}
$$

$
 S^{(k)}
$ is a local function, but this is non-canonical

**more sophisticated version**

consider any reasonable classical theory, with its
classical factorization algebra $X_S$

let $Q^{(n)}(X_S) = simplicial set of possible quantizations defined mod \hbar^{n+1}$

$
  Der_{loc}(X_S)
$ 
is the cochain complex of derivations of $X_S$, preserving
$P_0$-structure (is, in fact, local functions on an extended space)

theorem

there exists a sequence of simplicial sets

$$
  T^{(n)} \to T^{(n-1)}
  \to 
  \cdots \to 
  T^{(1)}
  \to pt
$$

with maps $T^{(n)} \to Q^{(n)}(X_S)$

such that $T^{(n)}$ fits into a [[homotopy limit|homotopy fiber diagram]]

$$
  \array{
    T^{(n)}
    &\to&
    0
    \\
    \downarrow
    &&
    \downarrow
    \\
    T^{n-1} &\stackrel{obstruction}{\to}& Der_{loc}(X_S)[2]
  }
$$

so we get obstructions; for instance for $\phi^4$-theory the obstruction is
the famous $\beta$-function

**theorem**
Let $g$ be a simple Lie algebra. Then there is a
quantization of Yang-Mills theory on $\mathbb{R}^4$
which is "renormalizable"
(behaves well with respect to scaling)

the set of quantizations is 1-dimensional term by term

The set of such quantizations is $\hbar \mathbb{R}[\![\hbar]\!]$


**correlation functions**

Where do correlation functions appear?

If $F$ is a factorization algebra on $M_S$, corresponding to some
QFT, then $F(B) = \{measurements we can make on the ball B\}$

if $B_1, B_2 \subset B$  are disjoint, the maps
$$
  F(B_1)\otimes F(B_2) \to F(B)
$$

is defined by doing both observations

correlation functions should be cochain maps

$$
  \langle 
    F(B_1) \otimes \cdots \otimes F(B_n) \to \mathbb{R}
  \rangle
$$

if $B_1, \cdots, B_n$ are disjoint, if 
$
  O_i \in F(B_i)
$

then

$$
  \langle O_1, \cdots, O_n\rangle
$$
is a measurement of how to observe $O_i$ correlations

if $B_1, B_2 \subset \tilde B$ the diagram

$$
  \array{
    F(B1) \otimes \cdots \otimes F(B_n)
    &\stackrel{\langle \cdots \rangle}{\to}&
    \mathbb{R}
    \\
    \downarrow && \uparrow^{\langle \cdots \rangle}
    \\
    F(\tilde B) \otimes F(B_3) \otimes \cdots \otimes F(B_n)
  }
$$

should commute (operator product expansion)

we can consider correlation functions with coefficients in any
cochain complex, we require they must satisfy this equation

**def** (Beilinson-Drinfeld)

$$
  CH_\bullet(M,F)
  =
  homotopy universal recipient of correlation functions
$$

$$
  = colim_{B_1, \cdots B_n \subset M disjoint}
F(B_1) \otimes \cdots F(B_n) 
$$

(Kevin Walker (blob homology), Jacob Lurie (topological chiral homology))

**lemma**
for a massive scalar field,

$$
  CH_\bullet(M,F) \simeq \mathbb{R}[\![\hbar]\!]
$$

in general

$
  CH_\bullet(M,F)
$ looks like measures on the space of critical points of the classical action

if we perturb around isolated critical points, 
$
  CH_\bullet(M,F)
  =
  \mathbb{R}[\![\hbar]\!]
$ 

in this situation correlation functions exist and are unique

general program: correlation functions define a measure 
on the space of classical solutions

(Feynman graphs appear here as homotopies between operads, or something, 
see his book)



#Wednesday, June 10#


## Alexander Kahle: superconnections and index theory ##


* 1) superconnections 

* 2) index theory

* 3) sketch some proofs

### 1) superconnections ###

**definition** A **superconnection** $\nabla_s$ on a
$\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded vector bundle $V \to M$ is an odd derivation
on $\Omega^\bullet(M,V)$

superconnections form an affine space modeled on $\Omega^\bullet(M, End(V))^{odd}$

$$
  End(V)
$$


$$
  \nabla_s = \omega_0 + \nabla + \omega_2 + \omega_3
$$

class in $K$-theory given by a map $V \stackrel{f}{\to} W$

unitary superconnection on $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded unitary bundles $V$
with map as a above look like

$$
  \nabla_s
  =
  \left(
    \array{
      & f^*
      \\
      f & 
    }
  \right)
  + \nabla
$$

**Chern character** by the usual formulas

$$
  ch(\nabla_s) := sTr e^{\nabla^2}
$$



### 2) index theory ###


**definition** Let $M$ be smooth Riemannian and $Spin$,
The Dirac operator associated to $(V \to M, \nabla_s)$
is defined by

* - $$ D(\nabla_s) : \Gamma(S \otimes V) 
  \stackrel{\nabla_s \otimes 1 \oplus 1 \otimes \nabla_s}{\to} \Omega^\bullet(M, S \otimes V) 
  \stackrel{c(.)}{\to} \Gamma(S \otimes V)
  $$


This is

* an elliptic operator;

* formally self adjoint

* of the form $$ D(\nabla_s) = \left(
    \array{
       & D'(\nabla_s)
       \\
       D'(\nabla_s)
    }
  \right)
  $$
  
* **theorem** (corollary of Atiyah-singer index theory)
  $$
    index(D(\nabla_s))
    =
    index(D(\nabla))
    =
    \int_M \hat A(\Omega^m) ch(\nabla_s)
  $$




so superconnections don't give new topological data: they are geometric objects
with the same underlyying topology as ordinary connections but refined "geometry"


recall that Atiyah-Singer says that

$$
  Tr \exp(-t D(\nabla_s)^2 ) = index(D(\nabla_s))
$$

the heat semi-group is smoothing, therefore it is represented by 
a kernel

$$
  \exp(-t D(\nabla_s)^2) \psi(x)
  =
  \int_M p_t(x,y) \psi(y) d y
$$

$$
  Tr \exp(-t  D(\nabla_s)^2) =
  \int_M Tr p_t(x,x) d vol
$$

the following expected formula which holds for ordinary
connections (due to Ezra Getzler) 
_no longer_ holds directly for superconnections

$$
  \lim_{t \to 0}
  Tr p_t(x,x) d vol
  \neq
  (2 \pi i)^{-n/2}
  [
    \hat A(\Omega^m) ch(\nabla_s)
  ]_n
$$

here $n = dim X$ is the dimension of the manifold


problem is that components in a superconnections scale in a different 

to make it true, we need to rescale

$$
  \nabla_s^t := |t|^{-1/2} \omega_0 + \nabla + |t|^{1/2} \omega_2 + \cdots
$$


A Riemannian map is a triple $(\pi, g, P)$

$
  \pi : M  \to B
$

a family with fibers close Spin manifolds,
$
  g^{M/B} 
$
a metric onm the fibers,
$$
  p : T(M) \to T(M/B)
$$

$$
  \array{
    V, \nabla_s
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    M
    \\
    \downarrow^\pi
    \\
    B
  }
$$


  $\pi_* (V)$ : a fibre at $y \in B$ is
  
  $\Gamma_y(S^{M/B} \otimes V)$

due to Bismut we get from a connection on the top a superconnecction
on the bottom (which is one of the main original motivations to be interested
in superconnection in the first place), 
which we tweak here a bit to get a superconnection on $B$
from a superconnection on $V$

$$
  \pi_! \nabla_s = \pi_! \nabla + \pi_! \omega
$$

with $\nabla_s = \nabla + \omega$

$$
  [\pi_! \omega_!]_{\omega}(\xi_1, \cdots, \xi_i)
  =
  c^{M/B}(2 (\tilde \xi_1), 2(\tilde \xi_2) \cdots 2(\tilde \xi_k))
$$

$$
  \pi^r = (\pi, r g^{M/B}, P)
$$

$$
  \lim_{t \to 0}
  ch(\pi_!^t \nabla_s)
  =
  (2 \pi i)^{dim M/B}
  \pi_*
  [
    \hat A(\Omega^{M/B} ch(\nabla_s))
  ]
$$

the scalings are related by

$$
  \pi_!^t(\nabla_s) = [\pi_! \nabla_s^{1/t}]^t
$$

* [Higher Hochschild Cohomology and Differential Forms on Mapping Spaces](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/04/higher_hochschild_cohomology_a.html)


)

outline

* language for some elementary algebraic topology

* application to generalizatons of Hochschild complexes

* Examples

  * invariants on mapping spaces
  
  * contributions related to def of Laplacian


**def/lema**

A commutative associative 
[[differential graded algebra]] is (equivalently given by) a 
strict monoidal functor

$$
  (FinSet, \coprod) \to (ChainComplexes, \otimes)
$$

generalize this

**def** a **partial DGA** is a  monoidal functor
with coherence map given by weak equivalence in the 
model structure

$$
 A :  (FinSet, \coprod) \to (ChainComplexes, \otimes)  
$$

i.e. there exists a natural weak equivalence

$$
  A(j \sqcup k) \stackrel{T}{\to} A(j) \otimes A(k)
$$

that respects the obvious coherence properties


generalized

* 1) co-algebras

* 2) any operad

* 3) note that $FinSet_*$ (pointed finite sets) is a module over $FinSet$, so generalize
  to modules, comodules, etc.
  
Then weak partial algebras can be functorially replaced by $E_\infty$-algebras

**example**

$X$ be a space $j \stackrel{f}{\to} k$

$$
  X^j = Map(j,X) \leftarrow Map(k,X) = X^k
$$

pass to the chains version of this

$$
  Ch_*(X^j) \leftarrow Ch_*(X^k)
$$

$$
  Ch^*(X^j) \to Ch^*(X^k)
$$

by Kuenneth formula we have a chain equivalence

$$
  C_*(X^j) \otimes C_*(X^k) \to C_*(X^{j+k})
$$

and similarly for cochains.

so this gives two things: 

* a partial coalgebra on $C_*(X)$

* a partial algebra on $C^*(X)$



Let $Y$ be any finite simplicial space. A partial algebra

$$
  \Delta \stackrel{\gama}{\to} FinSet \stackrel{A}{\to} ChainCompl
$$

simplicial object in $ChainCompl$, so total complex

$$
  CH^\gamma(A)
$$

meaning generalization of Hochschild complex

* this is joint work with Tradler and Zanelli (spelling? probably wrong)

goes back to Pitashvili and more recently Gregory Ginot

For $A = \Omega(X)$, then $CH^\gamma(A)$ computes cohomology of 
$X^\gamma $, if $X$ is sufficiently connected

**example**

let $A$ be a strict algebra, and $\gamma = Y = S^1$ then

$$
  CH^{S^1}(A) = \prod_{n \geq 0} A \otimes A^{\otimes n}
$$

is the Hochschild complex

there is also a shuffle product  in the game, so this implies there is an 
exponential map

calculate:

$$
  \exp(| \otimes x)
  =
  | + | \otimes x + | \otimes  x \otimes x + | \otimes  x \otimes x \otimes x + \cdots + 
$$

$$
  D \exp(1 \otimes x) = (1 \otimes d x + x \cdot x) \cdot e^{1 \otimes x}
$$

then: if $d x + x \cdot x = 0$ then $D e^{1 \otimes x} = 0$

this reminds us of curvature and connection

this can be taken further



let $A = \Omega^\bullet(M)$ be differential forms on $M$

$$
  \array{
    && CH^{S^1}(A) (\simeq \Omega(M^{S^1}))
    \\
    &\nearrow & \downarrow
    \\
    K(M)&\stackrel{ch}{\to}&\Omega(M)
  }
$$

commutes (due to some people)

**example 2**

$Y = I$ (the interval)

then $CH^I(A)$ is the 2-sided bar construction

more generally $CH(A, M, N) = \prod_{n \geq 0} M \otimes A^{\otimes n} \otimes N$

with $M$ and $N$ $A$-modules sitting on the end of the interval

consider the case $A = \Omega^\bullet(Riemannian manifold)$
and $M = A$ and $N = (\Omega^\bullet(...), d^* , (x\in A) \cdot (y\in N) = \star^{-1}(x \wedge \star y)))$

(the operatoin on $N$ here is the intersection product of forms)

Let $D$ be differential on $CH^I$

let $D$ be differential on $CH^I$ for normal structure, and 
and $D^*$ for $A, M, N$ as just described.

Set 

$$
  \Delta = [D, D^*]
$$


then acting with this $\Delta$ on something produces interesting non-linear
differential equations related to Witten't Morse-theory deformation 
of susy quantum mechanics and to Navier-Stokes' equations in fluid dynamics...

## Henriques: Invertible conformal nets ##

Andr&eacute; Henriques has notes on this work available on [his website](http://www.math.uu.nl/people/henrique/);

* Chris Douglas, Andr&eacute; Henriques, Michael Hill, _Geometric String structures -- notes on $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded conformal nets_ ([ps](http://www.math.uu.nl/people/henrique/TringWP.ps))

today: classification of invertible objects in a 3-category

**theorem** (Andr&eacute; Henriques, Arthur Bartels, Chris Douglas):
_Conformal nets form the objects of a symmetric monoidal 
3-category CN3_ .

* there is something about this written up to be found on Henriques' webpage.


**definition** A conformal net is a [[factorization algebra]] on the
category of 1-dimensional balls with values in
von Neumann algebras.

* 1-dim ball is just an interval, of course

* so a conformal net associates to each interval a vN algebra, and for each 
inclusion of intervals there is an inclusion of vN algebras

for $I, J$ two intervals equipped with an embedding into interval $K$
the net assigns

$$
  A : (J,K \subset I) \mapsto (A(J) \otimes A(K) \to A(I))

>Freed: why do you call this conformal ?

> Andr&eacute;: (as far as I understand the reply he gives after my question) the usual covariance condition under Moebius group imposed on conformal nets is taken care of here by havin not intervals in the
real line on the line but abstract intervals with maps between them being  embeddings. The claim is that this automatically implies the right kind of covariance that is otherwise imposed by hand.


**claim**

$$
  \{unitary full CFTs\} \simeq \{conformal nets\}
$$

>question: do you really mean _full_ instead of _chiral_ CFTs on the right?

>answer: yes

symmetric monoidal structure is objectwise the tensor product

**theorem** aa conformal net $A$ is invertible  in CN3 iff its
$\mu$-index $\mu(A)$ equals 1.

It is fully dualizable iff $\mu(A) \lt \infty$

in general $\mu(A) \in \{0\} \cup [1, \infty]$

### von Neumann algebras ###

in the 2-category of vN algebras, a morphism

$$
  A \to B
$$

is a bimodule ${}_A H_B$ where $H$ is a Hilbert space 

the unit
$$
   Id_A : A \to A
$$

is given by the bimodule called $L^2(A)$

this comes from the following: if $X$ is a measure space and $A$ arises as 
$L^\infty(X)$ then $L^2(A)$ is $L^2(X)$.

the general $L^2(A)$ is a non-commutative analog of this construction, for
$A$ which are not of the form "measurable functions on a measure space".

One word about composition, if 
$$
  A \stackrel{H}{\to} B  \stackrel{K}{\to} C
$$

given by $H \otimes_{Connes} K$ is the Connes-Fusion operation

associated to ${}_A H_B$ is

$$
  dim({}_A H_B) \in \{0\} \cup [1,\infty]
$$

$$
  dim = \left\{
    \array{
      0 & iff H=0
      \\
      1 & iff H is invertible
      \\
      \lt \infty & iff H has a dual
    }
  \right.
$$

**fact** think of an interval $I$ as the upper semicircle.
The two actions of $A(I)$ on 
$H_0 = L^2(A(I))$ can be used to define an
action of $A(J)$ on $H_0$ for every $J \usbset S^1$.

Because if $J$ is in the upper semicircle, use the left action,
if in the lowwer semicircle use the right action, if it is neither,
do something else (not explained here)

so $H_0$ has an action of $A(S^1)$.

so now everything is invariant projectively 
with respect to diffeomorphism group

**definition** 

given two circles $S_a, S_b$, let $nw(S_a)$ be north west quarter cicle, etc

consider $H_0$ as a bimodule over

$$
  A(sw(S_a)) \otimes A(ne(S_a))
$$

and

$$
  A(nw(S_b)) \otimes A(se(S_b))
$$


claim: $\mu(A) = dim(H_0)$


now some ideas on the proof of the first theorem

define always 

$$
  \bar A(I) = A(I)^{op} = A(\bar I)
$$

* if $A$ is dualizable, then $\bar A$ is its dual

* if $A$ is invertible, then $\bar A$ is its inverse

a 1-morphism in CN3, to be called a _defect_ is

consider the category of 
bi-colored 1-dimensional manifold is a 1-d manifolds 
(decomposition into intervals labeled by two things)
with morphisms being color-preserving maps

sufficient to look at intervals

* completely blue

* half blue, half orange

* completely orange

now a defect/1-morphism is a conformal net as above on bi-colored 1d manifolds

so suppose three nets and two defects

$$
  A \stackrel{D}{\to} B \stackrel{E}{\to} C
$$

then define the composition defect net by

$$
  D \otimes E ( blue-interval glued to yellow interval)
  =
  insert orange interval in the middle and average over all local evaluations
$$

the diffeomorphism group of the orange interval does act on the space
of all possible compositions here, which one shows to all be coherently isomorphic

now construct a defect

$$
 D:  A \otimes \bar A \to 1
$$
 by setting 
 
$$
  D(interval)
  := A(bent-around interval)
$$

(whatever that means)



## Henriques: informal evening session ##

things we could talk aout:

* composition of defects

* examples of conformal nets

* $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded version of all that

>Mike Hopkins: could we talk about relation full CFT to chiral CFT?

## examples for conformal nets ##

* from the standard chiral positive energy nets that are usually
called "conformal nets" in the literature we get the more
general considered here by tensoring two chiral bits ("left" and "right")
and choosing an extension 

examples can be obtained as follows

* loop group nets ($S^1 \to \tilde {L G} \to L G$)

* integral lattice

  * moonshine net: take the Leech lattice and do some orbifolding
  
    * its full automorphism group is isomorphic to the Monster

* free fermion

* minimal model = Virasoro 


general remarks:

* recall the Hillber space $H_0$ obtained from the full cnformal net as the
algebra of the upper semi circle

* but in practice one first constructs $H_0$ and then from that the net

* a functor 
  $$
    \left\{
      subintervals of S^1,
      diffeos between them
    \right\}
    \to V N
  $$
  is already the same as a functor on all abstract 
  intervals, since that category
  is equivalent to intervals in the circle

so given an interval $I$, construc the set of maps

$$
  I \mapsto Maps((I, \partial I), (G, \{e\}))
$$

if $I$ happens to be thought of as embedded in the circle, then
this group could be identified with the subgroup of the loop group
whose elements send the complement of $I$ to $e$.

but the point is there is way to get a conformal net here without assuming
embedding into $S^1$

so the algebra we will assign to $I$ is just the group algebra

$$
  I \mapsto \mathcal{C}(Maps((I, \partial I), (G, \{e\}))]
$$

forgetting all topology, but this still depends on the central extension
and it sits densely in the vN algebra obtained by taking the group,
letting it act on the vacuum in the Hilbert space $H_0$ through a rep of
$\tilde {L G}$

so $A(I)$ is now defined to be the completion of that algebra in $B(H_0)$

this here gives a chiral theory


>audience: one should think of intervals here as thickened points and of the vN algebras as what is assigned to the point in an extended CFT



### algebra assigned to the circle ###

here is how to get the algebra assigned to the circle:

puff up the circle to an annulus, cut this vertically in two pieces;
call the two intervals where the cut goes $I$ and $J$,

let $H_0$ be the Hilbert space assigned to the boundary circles of the
two pieces of the cut annulus. Then the algebra in question is the 
Connes fusion product of $H_0$ with itself over $A(I) \otimes A(J)$

$$
  A(circle) := H_0 \otimes^{Connes}_{A(I) \otimes A(J)} H_0
$$

>audience: so the circle doesn't really appear in this formula, it's just a thing to help us think about this

>answer: yes

now recall the definition of tensor product of nets

$$
  \left(
    A \otimes A^{op}
  \right)(I)
  :=
  A(I) \otimes A(I)^{op}
$$

then consider extensions $B$ of nets of the following form 

$$
  A \otimes A^{op} \hookrightarrow B
$$

such is cooked up from every Frobenius algebra object $Q$ in $Rep(A \otimes A^{op})$
(in vN theorists jargon this is a "$Q$-system")

in the 3-cattegory VN3 this $Rep(A)$ can be written as

$$
  Rep(A) 
  =
  End_{VN3}(Id_A)
  =
  \left\{
    \array{
        & \nearrow \searrow
       \\
       A &\Downarrow^{\rho}& A
       \\
       & \searrow \nearrow
    }
  \right\}
$$

to the circle $B$ assigns $Q$

## Corbett Redden: String structures and 3-forms ##


* notational conventions 

  * $M^n$ a smooth closed $n$-manifold
  
  * $g$ a Riem. metric 
  
  * $Spin \to P \to M$ a principal $Spin(n)$-bundle
  
  * $A$ a connection on $P$
  
  * $S$ a string class
  
### Outline ###

* I $\{String Structures\}/_{homotopy}$

* II harmonic 4-forms on $P$

* III geometry and tmf?

### I. String structures ###

**definition** 

* $B String$ is defined to be the homotopy fiber $B String(n) \to B Spin(n) \stackrel{p_1/2}{\to} K(\mathbb{Z},4)$

* a **String structure** on $\pi : P \to M$ is a lift of the classifying map to $B Spin$ through 
  $B String \to B Spin$
  $$
    \array{
        P && B String
        \\
        \downarrow &\nearrow& \downarrow
        \\
        M &\to& B Spin
    }
  $$
  
**Prop**

* String structure exists iff $\frac{1}{2}p_1(P) = 0 \in H^4(X,\mathbb{Z})$ (essentially by definition through homotopy fiber)

* let $i^*_P$ the pullback to the fiber of $P$, then we have
  $$\{String structures\}/_{homotopy} 
     \simeq_{canonical} \{String classes\} 
    := 
    \{\rho \in H^3(P,\mathbb{Z}) 
     s. t. i_P^* \rho = 1 
     \in H^3(Spin, \mathbb{Z})\}
  $$
  
* $\{string class\}$ is a torsor for $H^3(M, \mathbb{Z})$ under $\rho \mapsto \rho + \pi^ H^3(M)$

Proof. universal example

$$
  \array{
    K(\mathbb{Z},3) &\simeq& \pi^* E Spin &\to & E Spin
    \\
    && B String &\to& B Spin &\to& K(\mathbb{Z}, 4)
  }
$$

>hm, here is my ([[Urs Schreiber|Urs]]) description of the situation:

consider the following pasting diagram of 
[[homotopy limit|homtopy pullbacks]] 
($P$ is the given $Spin$-bundle, $\hat P$ its String-lift)

$$
  \array{
    String &\to& \hat P &\to& {*}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    Spin &\to& P &\to&  B^2 U(1) &\to& {*}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    {*} &\to& X &\to& B String(n) &\to& B Spin(n)
  }
$$

**Why String structures? **

String structure on $P$ $\stackrel{transgresses}{\mapsto}$
Spin structure on loop space $L Spin \to L P \to L M$

but all the reps of this loop group are projective, so there is 
actually a central $S^1$ extension of $L Spin$ in the game

$$
  \hat {L Spin} \to L Spin
$$

Need: 

$$
  \array{
    \hat {L Spin} &\to & \hat {L P}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    L Spin &\to& L P
  }
$$

$$
  \rho \in H^3(P, \mathbb{Z}) \mapsto 
$$

$$
  \array{
    (\pi_! ev^*) \rho &\in& H^2(L P, \mathbb{Z})
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    iniv. ext. && H^2(L G, \mathbb{Z})
  }
$$

(on the right: $S^1$-bundles)

** String orientation ** of tmf = topological modular forms

$$
  M O\langle 8\rangle^{-n} = M String &\stackrel{\sigma}{\to}& tmf^{-n}(pt)
$$

so give a String manifold with a String class on $Spin(T M)$

$$
  M , \rho \mapsto [M, \rho] \mapsto \sigma(M,\rho)
$$

$$
  \array{
    && tmf
    \\
    & {}^{\sigma}\nearrow & \downarrow
    \\
    M String &\stackrel{Witten genus}{\to}& Mod Forms
  }
$$


  $Witten genus(M) =$  "$index^{S^1} D_{L M}$"


(by the way, $\sigma$ is surjective on homotopy classes)


**warning**: I think above my $\rho$ should really be an $S$

### II Harmonic representative of $S$ ###

*reminder*

$(M,g) \mapsto \Delta = d d^* + d^* d$

$$
  H^k(M,\mathbb{R}) \simeq_{Hodge} \Delta^*_g \subset \Omega^k(M)
$$

**construction** 

start with $(\pi : P  \to M, g_m, A)$

choose a bininvariant metric 

$$
  g_\rho := \pi^* g_m \oplus g_{spin}
$$

where the direct sum comes from the splitting of tangent spaces $T_p P$ using
the connection that we have

Introduce scaling factor $\delta \gt 0$

$$
  g_\rho := \pi^* g_m \oplus \delta^2 g_{spin}
$$

take the "adiabatic limit" $\lim_{\delta \to 0}$

so now there is a 1-parameter family of metric on the bundle, and for each 
one can look at its Laplacian, so as $\delta$ tends to 0 something becomes
singular and one has to be careful, but fortunately others already did
that for us...


**theorem** (Mazzeo-Melrose, Dai, Forman)

the kernel
$
  Ker \Delta_{g_\rho} 
$ 

* extends smoothly to $\delta = 0$ 
  *(there is a smooth path in some Grassmannian space)

* and comes from a filtration isomorphic to Serre SS for $(Spin \to P \to M)$

this means that 

$$
  \Rightarrow H^k(P, \mathbb{Z})
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
   \lim_{\delta \to 0}
   Ker \Delta_{g_\rho}
   =: H^k(P)
$$

**Theorem** (Redden)

Given $P \stackrel{\pi}{\to} g, A$ and $\frac{1}{2}p_1(P) = 0$

then
$$
  \array{
    H^3(P, \mathbb{Z}) &\to& H^3(P,\mathbb{R}) &\to& H^3(P)
    \\
    S &&\mapsto& CS_3(A)&& CS_3(A) - \pi^* H 
  } 
$$

here $CS_3(A)$ is the Chern-Simons 3-form of the spin-connection

and recall $H^3(P)$ here denotes _harmonic forms_ on $P$ (should really be
script font

**remark**

in genral 

$$
  [\rho]_{g_\delta} = 
  CS_3(A) - \pi^* H + O(\delta) \not\in \pi^* \Omega^3(M)
$$

if we have a product of two groups we accordingly would get
CS of one connection minus CS of the other.

**What is $H$? **

(first digression)

**theorem** (Chern-Simons,...)

given $(P \to M , A)  \mapsto \hat {frac{1}{2} p_1}(A) \hat H^4(M)$ 


$$
  \array{
    \Omega^3_{\mathbb{Z}} &\to& 
    (M)\Omega^3(M) &\stackrel{a}{to}& \hat H^4(M) &\to& H^4(M,\mathbb{Z}) &\to& 0
    \\
    && 
    H &\mapsto& \hat{\frac{1}{2}p_1(A)} 
    &\mapsto& 
    \frac{1}{2}p_1(P) = 0
    && 
  }
$$

in particular

$$
  \array{
    && \mathbb{R}
    \\
    & {}^{\int H} \nearrow & \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbb{Z}_3(M)
    &\stackrel{\hat {\frac{1}{2}p_1(A)}}{\to}&
    \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}
  }
$$

and secondly  $d^* H = 0$

these two properties determine $H$ uniquely up to 
harmonic forms $\mathcal{H}^3_{\mathbb{Z}}(M) = ker \Delta_g$

**Equivariance**

$$
  H_{\rho + \pi^* \psi} = H_\rho + \pi^* H4
$$

where $\psi \in H^3(M, \mathbb{Z})$ $\mapsto H_4 \in \mathcal{H}^3(M)$

over all what this says is that if we go from

$$
 \array{
    Metr(M)\times A(P) \times \{String Class\} & (g,A,S)
    \\
    \downarrow & \downarrow
    \\
    \Omega^3(P) & CS_3(A) - \pi^* H_{q,A,S}
    \\
    \downarrow & \downarrow
    \\
    \Omega^3(M) & H_{g, A \rho}
 }
$$

$$
  \array{
     && tmf^{-n}
     \\
     & \nearrow & \downarrow
    \\
    M String &\stackrel{}{\to}&
    MF
  }
$$

**conjecture** (S. Stolz) if $M$ is String and admits a positive
Ricci curvature metric, then $Witten(M) = 0$

question: also $\sigma(M,\rho) = 0$? no, no way!

**hypothesis**

If $M$ is a Spin manifold that admits a metric and String structure
$(g, S)$ and $A$ is the Levi-Civita connection

such that

* $Ric(g) \gt 0$

* $H_{g,s} = 0 \in \Omega^3(M)$

$\Rightarrow \sigma(M,S) = 0 \in tmf^{-n}(pt)$

**example**  $M = S^3 = SU(2)$

$$
  p_1 \in H^4(S^3) = 0
$$

$$
  H^3(S^3, \mathbb{Z}) = \mathbb{Z} = number of string classes
$$

$$
  d H = d^* H = 0  \Rightarrow H \in H^3(S^3, \mathbb{R}) \simeq \mathbb{R}
$$

$$
  \array{
    String Classes
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    M String^{-3} = \pi_3^S = tmf^{-3} = \mathbb{Z}/{24}
  }
$$

>(can't type the full diagram...)

consider a 1-parameter family of "berger metrics" on $S^3$

rescaling the fiber in the Hopf fibration $S^1 \to S^3 \to S^2$
