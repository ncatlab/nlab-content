## Definition

A [[morphism]] $f\colon A\to B$ in a [[2-category]] $K$ is said to be **(representably) faithful** if for all objects $X$, the induced [[functor]]
$$K(X,A) \to K(X,B)$$
is [[faithful functor|faithful]].  In [[Cat]], this is equivalent to $f$ being faithful in the usual sense.

## Remarks

* Faithful morphisms may also be called **2-monic** and said to make their [[source]] into a **2-subobject** of their [[target]].  See [[subcategory]] for discussion.

* Faithful morphisms often form the right class of a [[factorization system in a 2-category|factorization system]].  In [[Cat]], the left class consists of [[essentially surjective functor|essentially surjective]] and [[full functor|full]] functors.

* Of course, any [[fully faithful morphism]] is also faithful, and in particular any [[inverter]] or [[equifier]] is faithful.  Moreover, any [[inserter]] is also faithful, though not generally fully-faithful.
