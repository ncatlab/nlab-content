The Hamiltonian of a [[dynamical system]] is the sum of the kinetic and potential energy:
\[ H = T + V. \]

Knowing only $H$ as a function on [[phase space]] (so as a function of [[position]] $q^i$ and [[momentum]] $p_i$), we can derive other quantities as functions on phase space.  In particular, we have:
*  [[velocity]], $v^i = \partial{H}/\partial{p_i}$,
*  [[force]], $f_i = -\partial{H}/\partial{q^i}$.

Setting $v^i = \mathrm{d}q^i/\mathrm{d}t$ and $f_i = \mathrm{d}p_i/\mathrm{d}t$, we derive the [[equations of motion]] in [[Hamiltonian mechanics]].
