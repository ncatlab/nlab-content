## Idea

Recall that the $n$th [[symmetric product]] (or [[symmetric power]]?) of a space, say $X$, is what you get if you take $n$ points in $X$ without considering the order in which they appear.  Since repetitions are allowed, one has to think carefully as to how to deal with multiplicities: either to respect them or to ignore them.
The first case, respecting multiplicities, means that $\{0,1,1\}$ and $\{0,0,1\}$ are not considered equivalent.  The second means that they are.

On this page we use the first definition, respecting multiplicities, and work with the [[circle]], $S^1$, as our original space.  The resulting spaces have straightforward descriptions and simple [[homotopy types]]: all are homotopic to the circle.  These descriptions can be found in [MR0210096](#MR0210096)

There is a link between this space and the [[unitary group]] of a finite dimensional complex [[Hilbert space]].  The conjugacy class of a [[unitary matrix]] is determined completely by its [[eigenvalue]]s with their multiplicities in that two unitary matrices are conjugate if and only if their sets-with-multiplicities ([[multiset|bags]]) of eigenvalues are the same.  The eigenvalues of a unitary matrix lie on a circle, but as we are considering the collections as sets and not ordered sets, we must consider the set of eigenvalues as a point in the symmetric product of the circle.  Hence knowing this space tells us about the space of conjugacy classes of unitary matrices.


## Definition

The notion of a *symmetric product* makes sense in any [[category]] with [[products]] and finite [[colimits]].

+-- {: .num_defn #symprod}
###### Definition
Let $C$ be a category with products and coequalisers.
Let $X$ be an object of $C$.
Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and write $\Sigma_n$ for the $n$th [[symmetric group]].
We define the **symmetric product** of $X$ to be the colimit of the diagram

$$
\coprod_{\sigma \in \Sigma_n} X^n \to X^n
$$

where the morphism $X^n \to X^n$ corresponding to $\sigma \in \Sigma_n$ is that induced by sending the $i$ copy of $X$ to the $i\sigma$ copy.
=--

On this page, we consider the [[circle]] to be a [[topological space]] and thus define its symmetric products accordingly.

+-- {: .num_defn #sympcircle}
###### Definition
Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$.  The $n$th symmetric product of $S^1$, written $SP^n(S^1)$, is the $n$th symmetric product of $S^1$ considered as a topological space.
=--


## Properties

The main property of $SP^n(S^1)$ is the following description, due to H. R. Morton in [MR0210096](#MR0210096).

+-- {: .num_proposition #symcirdesc}
###### Proposition
The topological space $SP^n(S^1)$ is a fibre bundle over $S^1$ with fibre an $n-1$ [[simplex]].  If $n$ is odd, the bundle is orientable; if $n$ is even then it is not.

In particular, $SP^2(S^1)$ is a M&ouml;bius strip.
=--

Before proving this, let us give the descriptions of a related space.

+-- {: .num_proposition #symcplx}
###### Proposition
The topological space $SP^n(\mathbb{C}^*)$ is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{C}^{(n-1)} \times \mathbb{C}^*$.
=--

Here, $\mathbb{C}^*$ is the set of non-zero complex numbers.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof
The proof rests on giving an alternative description of $SP^n(\mathbb{C}^*)$ in which the lack of ordering of the points is built in at the start.  This description is given by taking the polynomial whose roots are the points (here we can see why it is important to take note of the multiplicities).

We define a map $SP^n(\mathbb{C}^*) \to \Poly_n$, the space of polynomials of degree at most $n$, by sending $[\zeta_1,\dots,\zeta_n]$ to the monic polynomial $(z - \zeta_1)\cdots (z - \zeta_n)$.  This is a [[homeomorphism]] onto its image.  That image is the space of monic polynomials with non-zero constant term (as all the $\zeta_j$ are non-zero).  There is an obvious homeomorphism of this space to $\mathbb{C}^{n-1} \times \mathbb{C}^*$ given by taking coefficients.
=--

This space is relevant because the construction $SP^n(-)$ respects homotopy equivalences.  Hence $SP^n(S^1)$ is homotopy equivalent to $S^1$ and the map $SP^n(S^1) \to S^1$ is given by multiplying the $n$ elements of a point in $SP^n(S^1)$.

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof of Proposition \ref{symcirdesc}

Now let us prove the proposition.  Guided by the description for $SP^n(\mathbb{C}^*)$, we define $p \colon SP^n(S^1) \to S^1$ by $p(\{\zeta_1,\dots,\zeta_n\}) = \zeta_1 \dots \zeta_n$.  Let us show that this is a fibre bundle.  For $\lambda \in S^1$ we define a map $p^{-1}(\lambda) \times (S^1 \setminus \{\overline{\lambda}\}) \to p^{-1}(S^1 \setminus \{\overline{\lambda}\})$ by:

$$
p(\{\zeta_1,\dots,\zeta_n\},\lambda e^{i t}) = \{\zeta_1 e^{i t/n}, \dots, \zeta_n e^{i t/n}\}
$$

where $t \in (-\pi,\pi)$.

It remains to determine the fibre at $1$ and the gluing map at, say, $-1$.

The description of the fibre is straightforward, although showing that it is actually the fibre is slightly more complicated.  The idea is to attempt to consistently choose a logarithm for each point on the circle.  Of course, we cannot do this consistently when we consider individual points, but we can do it when we consider a collection in which we do not distinguish copies of the same point.

Let us illustrate first for the case $n = 2$.  Then $SP^2(S^1)$ consists of equivalence classes of pairs of points $\{\zeta_1,\zeta_2\}$ in $S^1$, with repetition allows.  In the fibre of $p$ at $1$ we have the condition $\zeta_1 \zeta_2 = 1$ and so we can write our pair as $\{\zeta,\overline{\zeta}\}$.

On the subset $\zeta \ne -1$ there is a clear parametrisation with domain $[0,1)$ given by $t \mapsto \{e^{i \pi t}, e^{-i \pi t}\}$.  The claim is that this extends to a homeomorphism $[0,1] \to p^{-1}(1)$ by sending $1$ to $\{-1,-1\}$.  We can define the inverse map directly by sending $\zeta$ to $\Re(\zeta)$ and then composing with an appropriate inverse trigonometric function, but it is more instructive to consider why this works.

Let us imagine that we approach $\{-1,-1\}$ and pass through it.  Both before and after, we have two dots moving around the circle mirroring each other.  At the crucial time, they meet at $-1$, and then move apart again.  Since they are mirroring each other, one comes back along the top part of the circle and one along the bottom.  The crucial piece of the puzzle is that we cannot tell which is which.  So as far as we are concerned, the two dots may have passed through each other or may have bounced back off each other again.

This idea generalises to arbitrary $n$.  Given $\{\zeta_1, \dots, \zeta_n\} \in p^{-1}(1)$ we consider all $n$-tuples $\{t_1,\dots,t_n\}$ with $t_j \le t_{j+1}$ and $t_n \le t_1 + 2 \pi$ such that $\{e^{2 i \pi t_j}\} = \{\zeta_j\}$.  We can move from one such $n$-tuple to the next by either adding $1$ to $t_1$ and putting it at the top, or subtracting $1$ from $t_n$ and putting it at the bottom.  The sum $\sum t_j$ takes values in $\mathbb{Z}$ and the $n$-tuple $\{t_1,\dots,t_n\}$ is uniquely determined by this sum.  In particular, there is a choice with sum $0$.

Using this, we define a map $p^{-1}(1) \to \Delta^n$ by
$$
\{\zeta_1,\dots,\zeta_n\} \mapsto (t_2 - t_1,t_3 - t_2, \dots, t_n - t_{n-1}, t_1 + 1 - t_n).
$$
