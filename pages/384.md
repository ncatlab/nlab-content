## Idea

A **CW-complex** is a [[nice topological space]] which can be built up inductively, by a process of attaching disks along their boundaries. They are principal objects of interest in algebraic topology; in fact, most spaces of interest to algebraic topologists are [[homotopy equivalence|homotopy equivalent]] to CW-complexes. (And every space is [[weak homotopy equivalence|weakly homotopy equivalent]] to a CW-complex, but need not be strongly homotopy equivalent to one.) 


## Definition

A CW-complex is a topological spaces $X$ equipped with a sequence of spaces and continuous maps

\[\label{CW1}\varnothing = X_{-1} \hookrightarrow X_0 \hookrightarrow X_1 \hookrightarrow \ldots \hookrightarrow X_n \hookrightarrow \ldots
\]

and a [[cocone]] making $X$ into its [[colimit]] (in [[Top]], or else in the category of [[compactly generated space]]s or one of many other [[nice category of spaces|nice categories of spaces]]) where each space $X_n$ (called the $n$-skeleton of $X$) is the result of attaching copies of the $n$-disk $D^n = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n: ||x|| \leq 1\}$ along their boundaries $S^{n-1} = \partial D^n$ to $X_{n-1}$. Specifically, $X_{-1}$ is the empty space, and each $X_n$ is a pushout in [[Top]] of a diagram of the form 

$$X_{n-1} \stackrel{(f_i)}{\leftarrow} \coprod_{i \in I} S_{i}^{n-1} \stackrel{\coprod_i j_i}{\to} \coprod_{i \in I} D_{i}^n$$ 

where $I$ is some index set, each $j_i: S_{i}^{n-1} \to D_{i}^n$ is the boundary inclusion of a copy of $D^n$, and 
$f_i: S_{i}^{n-1} \to X_{n-1}$ is a continuous map, often called an _attaching map_. The coprojections $X_{n-1} \to X_n$ of these pushouts give the arrows on which diagram (eq:CW1) is based. 

A relative CW-complex $(X, A)$ is defined as above, except $X_{-1} = A$ is allowed to be any space.

A _finite CW-complex_ is one which admits a presentation in which there are only finitely many attaching maps, and similarly a _countable CW-complex_ is one which admits a presentation with countably many attaching maps. 

Formally this means that (relative) CW-complexes are (relative) [[cell complexes]] with respect to the [[cofibrantly generated model category|generating cofibrations]] in the standard [[model structure on topological spaces]].

Milnor has argued that the category of spaces which are homotopy equivalent to CW-complexes, also called [[m-cofibrant spaces]], is a [[nice category of spaces|convenient category of spaces]] for algebraic topology.


## Properties

### Local contractibility

* A CW-complex is a [[locally contractible space]].

### Singular homology
 {#SingularHomology}

We discuss aspects of the [[singular homology]] $H_n(-) \colon $ [[Top]] $\to$ [[Ab]] of CW-complexes. See also at _[[cellular homology]] of CW-complexes_.

Let $X$ be a CW-complex and write 

$$
  X_0 \hookrightarrow X_1 \hookrightarrow X_2 \hookrightarrow \cdots \hookrightarrow X
$$

for its [[filtered topological space]]-structure with $X_{n+1}$ the topological space obtained from $X_n$ by gluing on $(n+1)$-cells. For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ write $nCells \in Set$ for the set of $n$-cells of $X$.


+-- {: .num_prop }
###### Proposition

The [[relative singular homology]] of the filtering degrees is

$$
  H_n(X_k , X_{k-1})
  \simeq
  \left\{
    \array{
       \mathbb{Z}[nCells] & if\; k = n
       \\
       0 & otherwise
    }
  \right.
  \,,
$$

where $\mathbb{Z}[nCells]$ denotes the [[free abelian group]] on the set of $n$-cells.

The proof is spelled out at _[Relative singular homology - Of CW complexes](relative+homology#RelativeHomologyOfCWComplexes)_.


+-- {: .num_prop #RelativeHomologyOfFilterStep}
###### Proposition

With $k,n \in \mathbb{N}$ we have

$$
  (k \gt n) \Rightarrow (H_k(X_n) \simeq 0)
  \,.
$$

In particular if $X$ is a CW-complex of finite [[dimension]] $dim X$ (the maximum degree of cells), then 

$$
  (k \gt dim X) \Rightarrow (H_k(X) \simeq 0).
$$

For instance ([Hatcher, lemma 2.34 b)](#Hatcher)).

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

By the [[long exact sequence]] in [[relative homology]], discussed at _[Relative homology -- long exact sequences](relative+homology#LongExactSequences)_, we have an [[exact sequence]]

$$
  H_{k+1}(X_n , X_{n-1})
  \to 
  H_k(X_{n-1})
  \to 
  H_k(X_n)
  \to 
  H_k(X_n, X_{n-1})
  \,.
$$

Now by prop. \ref{RelativeHomologyOfFilterStep} the leftmost and rightmost homology groups here vanish when $k \neq n$ and $k \neq n-1$ and hence exactness implies that

$$
  H_k(X_{n-1})
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  H_k(X_n)
$$

is an [[isomorphism]] for $k \neq n,n-1$. This implies the claim by [[induction]] on $n$.

## Examples

* The [[geometric realization]] of any locally finite [[simplicial set]] is a CW-complex ([Milnor 57](#Milnor57)). 

  * In particular in the context of the [[homotopy hypothesis]] the [[Quillen equivalence]]  between [[∞-groupoid]]s and [[nice topological space]]s maps each [[∞-groupoid]] to a CW-complex.

* any [[compact space|noncompact]] [[smooth manifold]] of [[dimension]] $n$ is [[homotopy equivalence|homotopy equivalent]] to an $(n-1)$-dimensional CW-complex. ([Napier-Ramachandran](#NapierRamachandran)).
