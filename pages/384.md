## Idea

A **CW-complex** is a [[nice topological space]] which can be built up inductively, by a process of attaching disks along their boundaries. They are principal objects of interest in algebraic topology; in fact, most spaces of interest to algebraic topologists are [[homotopy equivalence|homotopy equivalent]] to CW-complexes. (And every space is [[weak homotopy equivalence|weakly homotopy equivalent]] to a CW-complex, but need not be strongly homotopy equivalent to one.) 


## Definition

A CW-complex is a topological spaces $X$ equipped with a sequence of spaces and continuous maps

\[\label{CW1}\varnothing = X_{-1} \hookrightarrow X_0 \hookrightarrow X_1 \hookrightarrow \ldots \hookrightarrow X_n \hookrightarrow \ldots
\]

and a [[cocone]] making $X$ into its [[colimit]] (in [[Top]], or else in the category of [[compactly generated space]]s or one of many other [[nice category of spaces|nice categories of spaces]]) where each space $X_n$ (called the $n$-skeleton of $X$) is the result of attaching copies of the $n$-disk $D^n = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n: ||x|| \leq 1\}$ along their boundaries $S^{n-1} = \partial D^n$ to $X_{n-1}$. Specifically, $X_{-1}$ is the empty space, and each $X_n$ is a pushout in [[Top]] of a diagram of the form 

$$X_{n-1} \stackrel{(f_i)}{\leftarrow} \coprod_{i \in I} S_{i}^{n-1} \stackrel{\coprod_i j_i}{\to} \coprod_{i \in I} D_{i}^n$$ 

where $I$ is some index set, each $j_i: S_{i}^{n-1} \to D_{i}^n$ is the boundary inclusion of a copy of $D^n$, and 
$f_i: S_{i}^{n-1} \to X_{n-1}$ is a continuous map, often called an _attaching map_. The coprojections $X_{n-1} \to X_n$ of these pushouts give the arrows on which diagram (eq:CW1) is based. 

A relative CW-complex $(X, A)$ is defined as above, except $X_{-1} = A$ is allowed to be any space.

A _finite CW-complex_ is one which admits a presentation in which there are only finitely many attaching maps, and similarly a _countable CW-complex_ is one which admits a presentation with countably many attaching maps. 

Formally this means that (relative) CW-complexes are (relative) [[cell complexes]] with respect to the [[cofibrantly generated model category|generating cofibrations]] in the standard [[model structure on topological spaces]].

Milnor has argued that the category of spaces which are homotopy equivalent to CW-complexes, also called [[m-cofibrant space]]s, is a convenient category of spaces for algebraic topology.


## Properties

* A CW-complex is a [[locally contractible space]].

## Examples

* The [[geometric realization]] of any locally finite [[simplicial set]] is a CW-complex.

  * In particular in the context of the [[homotopy hypothesis]] the [[Quillen equivalence]]  between [[∞-groupoid]]s and [[nice topological space]]s maps each [[∞-groupoid]] to a CW-complex.

* any [[compact space|noncompact]] [[smooth manifold]] of [[dimension]] $n$ is [[homotopy equivalence|homotopy equivalent]] to an $(n-1)$-dimensional CW-complex.
