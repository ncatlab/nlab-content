The **empty set** is the [[set]] with no elements.

The empty set is unique in most membership-based [[foundations]], but in any case we can say 'the' empty set, since any two empty sets are isomorphic by a unique isomorphism (the [[generalized the]]). In fact, the empty set is given by a [[universal property]]: it is the [[initial object]] in the [[Set|category of sets]].

The empty set can be confusing, because it is a degenerate case. Indeed, it is defined as an exception: every set is [[inhabited set|inhabited]], except the empty set. Nothing belongs to the empty set, but the empty set itself is something. Mathematics students are confused that there is a function from the empty set to itself, and even grown mathematicians will misstate definitions because they forget about the empty set.

* Remark: An earlier revision of this article had a discussion on the meaning of the expression $0^0$. The meaning of course depends on how exponentiation (in a ring or rig that admits exponentiation) is defined; if the rig is the natural numbers and exponentiation $m^n$ is defined to be the cardinality of $\hom([m], [n])$ where $[m]$ is an $m$-element set, then $0^0 = 1$ unambiguously. But exponentiation for the real field ($x^y$ for $x \gt 0$) is standardly defined by continuity considerations, and cannot be continuously extended to cover $0^0$. Note that the latter point has nothing to do with the empty set!
