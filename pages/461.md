The **empty set** is the [[set]] with no elements.

The empty set is unique in most membership-based [[foundations]], but in any case we can say 'the' empty set, since any two empty sets are isomorphic by a unique isomorphism (the [[generalized the]]). In fact, the empty set is given by a [[universal property]]: it is the [[initial object]] in the [[Set|category of sets]].

The empty set can be confusing, because it is a degenerate case. Indeed, it is defined as an exception: every set is [[inhabited set|inhabited]], except the empty set. Nothing belongs to the empty set, but the empty set itself is something. Mathematics students are confused that there is a function from the empty set to itself, and algebra textbooks still teach them that $0^0$ is undefined. Even grown mathematicians will misstate definitions because they forget about the empty set.

_[[Mike Shulman|Mike]]_: To be fair to the algebra textbooks, there are other meanings of exponentiation for which $0^0$ is harder to get a handle on.  For instance, if the limits as $x \to 0$ of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are both 0, we still can't say much about the limit of $(f(x))^{g(x)}$.

_Toby_: Weren\'t you there on sci.math? Do you realise what a can of worms this is? (^_^)

I was a relative defender of the undefined position, but even I couldn\'t accept baldly stating that it\'s undefined. (Baldly stating $0^0 = 1$ would be better, if a more nuanced position wouldn\'t work.) Today, I tell my algebra students that the textbook has a mistake, although I promise not to quiz them on it. (Since I don\'t think a more nuanced position would work.)

All of the arguments (probably nothing to you, unless perhaps some history) are on [the sci.math FAQ](http://www.faqs.org/faqs/sci-math-faq/specialnumbers/0to0/).

[[Mike Shulman|Mike]]: I don't think _I_ should be blamed for opening the can of worms... I think that distinction belongs to the person who wrote "algebra textbooks still teach them that $0^0$ is undefined" as if it were obvious that it is defined.  (-:

Maybe the right thing to say is that the value of $0^0$ depends on whether by $0$ you mean zero, the natural number, or zero, the real number.  Perhaps $0_natural^{0_natural} = 1$ and $0_real^{0_natural}=1$ but $0_real^{0_real}$ is undefined.  (-:  Of course, the cardinality of the empty set is $0_natural$, so in the context of this page, $0^0=1$.
