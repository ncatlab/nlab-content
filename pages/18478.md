## Idea

The concept of _pseudo-orthogonal structure_ is the analog of that of _[[orthogonal structure]]_ as one generalized from Euclidean [[signature of a quadratic form|signature]] to [[Lorentz group|Lorentzian]] signature.

Given a [[smooth manifold]] $X$ of [[dimension]] $n$, then a _pseudo-orthogonal structure_ of $X$ is a [[reduction of the structure group]] of its [[frame bundle]] along the inclusion $O(n-1,1) \hookrightarrow GL(n)$ of the [[Lorentz group]] into the [[general linear group]]. 

In [[physics]],  specifically in the [[first-order formulation of gravity]], such a [[G-structure]] is often called a _[[vielbein]]_ field.

A pseudo-orthogonal structure induces a [[pseudo-Riemannian metric]] on $X$.
