###### Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, an **[[n-plectic vector space]]**
is a [[vector space]] $V$ (over the [[real numbers]]) equipped with an $(n+1)$-linear skew function

$$
  \omega : \wedge^{n+1} V \to \mathbb{R}
$$

such that regarded as a function

$$
  V \to \wedge^n V^*
$$

is has trivial [[kernel]].
