## Idea

For $Y \to Z$ a morphism of [[pointed object|pointed]] [[âˆž-groupoid]]s and $X \to Y$ its [[homotopy fiber]], there is a [[long exact sequence]] of [[homotopy group]]s

$$
  \cdots \to \pi_{n+1}(Z) \to \pi_n(X) \to \pi_n(Y) \to \pi_n(Z) \to \pi_{n-1}(X) \to \cdots
  \,.
$$

In terms of [[presentable (infinity,1)-category|presentations]] this means:

for $Y \to Z$ a fibration in the ordinary [[model structure on topological spaces]] or in the [[model structure on simplicial sets]], and for $X \to Y$ the ordinary [[fiber]] of [[topological space]]s or [[simplicial set]]s, respectively, we have such a long exact sequence.

For background and details see [[fibration sequence]].

## Related concepts

* [[fiber sequence]]

* Given a [[tower of homotopy fibers]] such as a [[Whitehead tower]] or [[Adams resolution]], the long exact sequences of homotopy groups for each stage combine to yield an [[exact couple]]. The corresponding [[spectral sequence]] is the _[[Adams spectral sequence]]_.
