## Definition

A __locally ringed space__ is a [[ringed space]] $(X,\mathcal{O})$ such that the [[stalks]] of the [[structure sheaf]] $\mathcal{O}$ are [[local ring]]s. 

A [[morphism]] of locally ringed space is a morphism of ringed spaces $(f,f^\sharp):(X,\mathcal{O}_X)\to (Y,\mathcal{O}_Y)$, where $f:X\to Y$, such that the [[comorphism]] $f^\sharp:\mathcal{O}_Y\to f_*\mathcal{O}_X$ is a morphism of [[local rings]] (that is, a map of rings which respects the [[maximal ideal]]).

## Examples
* The category of smooth manifolds has a fully faithful embedding into the category of locally ringed spaces. Lucas Braune gives a nice proof in his [answer](http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/225528/differentiable-manifolds-as-locally-ringed-spaces) on math stackexchange.
