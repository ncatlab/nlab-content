## Idea

Generally, given an [[action]] of a [[group]] on some [[space]], then a _stable point_ of the action is one whose [[stabilizer subgroup]] is a [[finite group]]. This means that the [[quotient stack]] restricted to the stable points is "tame" in that it is just an [[orbifold]].

More specifically, in [[geometric invariant theory]] one gives criteria for (semi-)stability of points in [[projective varieties]] under the [[action]] of [[reductive groups]]. A central application here is to the construction of [[moduli stacks]] of (semi-)[[stable vector bundles]], which are, roughly, the (semi-)stable points under the [[action]] of the [[gauge group]].

A review of the definition of GIT-(semi-)stable points is in ([Saiz 09, pp. 27-28](#Saiz09)). Review of (semi-)[[stable vector bundles]] as GIT-(semi-)stable points is in ([Saiz 09, section 2.3](#Saiz09)).
