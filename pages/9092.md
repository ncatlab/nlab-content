The notion of perfect obstruction theory is introduced by Behrend and Fantechi. 



## For derived schemes {#derived schemes}

Every derived scheme has a canonical perfect obstruction theory given as follows. 

Let $X$ be a [[derived scheme]]. Let $j$ denote the morphism from the underlying ordinary scheme

$$
j: t_0(X) \to X
$$

The cotangent complex functor sends this to an arrow in the [[tangent (infinity,1)-category]]

$$
L_{t_0(X)} \to j^*X
$$

This morphism of [[quasicoherent sheaves]] is a perfect obstruction theory.
