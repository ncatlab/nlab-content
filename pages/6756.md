###### Definition

For $(X,\omega)$ a [[symplectic manifold]], a [[vector field]] $v \in \Gamma(T X)$ is called a **Hamiltonian vector field** if is contraction with the 2-form $\omega$ is exact: there is $\alpha \in C^\infty(X)$ such that

$$
  \iota_v \omega = d \alpha
  \,.
$$

In this case $\alpha$ is called a [[Hamiltonian]] for $v$.

###### Definition

For $(X,\omega)$ an [[n-plectic manifold]], a [[vector field]] $v \in \Gamma(T X)$ is called a **Hamiltonian vector field** if is contraction with the $(n+1)$-form $\omega$ is exact: there is $\alpha \in \Omega^{n-1}(X)$ such that

$$
  \iota_v \omega = d \alpha
  \,.
$$

In this case $\alpha$ is called a [[Hamiltonian]] $(n-1)$-form for $v$.
