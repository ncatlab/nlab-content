## Idea

### General

What is known as _(Grothendieck's) six operations_ is a formalization of structure that 

* assigns to every [[morphism]] $f$ of suitable [[spaces]] a ([[derived direct image|derived]])[[direct image]]/([[derived inverse image|derived]])[[inverse image]] [[adjunction]] $(f^\ast \dashv f_*)$;

* assigns to every [[separated morphism]] a [[direct image with compact support]]/[[Verdier duality|Verdier dual]] [[adjunction]] $(f_! \dashv f^!)$.

These are _four operations_ and together with

* a [[closed monoidal category|closed]] [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric monoidal]] [[tensor product]]/[[internal hom]] [[adjunction]] $(\otimes X \dashv [X,-])$ 

form _six operations_. 

(All this is usually interpreted as [[derived functors]]/[[(infinity,1)-functors]] so that for instance in the usual application to [[derived categories]] of [[abelian sheaves]] the last two operations are really [[Tor]] and [[Ext]].) 

With a list of compatibility conditions between these (for instance ([Cisinski-Déglise 09, p. x](#CisinskiDeglise09)) this is a structure of _Grothendieck's six operations_.


These consistency conditions include the following:

1. The adjunctions are functorial, hence form [[2-functors]] $f \mapsto f_*$, $f \mapsto f_!$:

1. There is a [[natural transformation]]  $f_! \to f_*$ which is a [[natural equivalence]] when $f$ is a [[proper map]]. 

1. [[Beck-Chevalley condition]]: given a ([[homotopy pullback|homotopy]]) [[pullback]] [[diagram]]

   $$
     \array{
       && Q_1 \underset{X}{\times} Q_2
       \\
       & {}^{\mathllap{p_1}}\swarrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{p_2}}
       \\
       Q_1 && && Q_2
       \\
       & {}_{\mathllap{f}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{g}}
       \\
       && X
     }
   $$

   such that $f$ is a [[separated morphism]], then there are [[natural equivalences]]

   $$
     g^\ast \circ f_! \simeq (p_2)_! \circ (p_1)^\ast
   $$

   $$
     f^! \circ g_\ast \simeq (p_1)_\ast\circ (p_2)^!
     \,. 
   $$

Morover one imposes a formalization of [[Verdier duality]] with [[dualizing object]]...

### Specializations

Often specializations of the general concept play a role:

* if $f^! \simeq f^\ast$: [[Wirthmüller context]]

* if $f_! \simeq f_\ast$: [[Grothendieck context]]


## Properties

### Relation to motivic homotopy theory

The [[initial object]] in the [[(infinity,2)-category]] of functors to [[stable (infinity,1)-categories]] which satisfy the _six  operations_ formalism (and a bit more, such that [[motivic homotopy theory|A1-homotopy invariance]]) is _[[stable motivic homotopy theory]]_. See there for more.
