## Idea

### Traditional notion

Given a [[presymplectic manifold]] $(X,\omega)$ there is the [[Poisson bracket]] [[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{Poisson}(X.\omega)$ of [[Hamiltonians]] and their [[Hamiltonian vector fields]]. This is a [[extension of Lie algebras]] of the Lie algebra of just Hamiltonian vecotor fields. Over a [[connected topological space|connected]] manifold it is an extension by $\mathbb{R}$. The [[Lie integration]] of this extension is the [[quantomorphism group]]-extension of the group of [[Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms]].

These extensions are called **Kostant-Souriau extensions** after [[Bertram Kostant]] and [[Jean-Marie Souriau]]. They play a central role in [[geometric quantization]].

### Refinement to higher geometry

For $(X,\omega)$ a [[pre-n-plectic manifold]] there is an [[L-∞ algebra]] extension that generalizes the Kostant Souriau extension: the [[Poisson bracket L-∞ algebra]] ([Rogers](#Rogers)).

These in turn are special cases of [[L-∞ algebra cohomology|L-∞ algebra extension]]/[[∞-group extensions]] which are variants of the [[higher Atiyah groupoid]]-extensions that exist in general in [[cohesive]] [[higher geometry]] ([Hgpt](#Hgpt)), as indicated in the following table:
