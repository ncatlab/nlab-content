## Idea

In principle, any [[interaction]] between two [[physical systems]] is a __measurement__, whereby each system measures the [[state]] of the other.  In practice, we break the symmetry by treating one system as the real physical system $S$ of study and the other system as merely a __measuring apparatus__ $A$ with the sole purpose of measuring $S$.  If the properties of $A$ are more directly [[observable]] than those of $S$, then this is useful.
