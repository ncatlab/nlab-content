## Idea 

A **p-adic differential equation** is a [[differential equation]] in which the role of the [[real numbers]] is played by the [[field]] of [[p-adic numbers]] for some prime $p$.

According to [Kedlaya 10](#Kedlaya10), the study of [[zeta functions]] via $p$-adic analysis lends itself much more readily to numerical computation than do methods employing [[étale cohomology]]:

>...it is not straightforward to describe étale cohomology to a computer well enough that the computer can make calculations. ([Kedlaya 10, p.5](#Kedlaya10))
