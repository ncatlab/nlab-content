Given a unital (typically noncommutative) [[ring]] $R$, the __Jacobson radical__ $J(R)$ is defined as the set of elements $r\in R$ satisfying the following equivalent properties:

1. For each [[simple object|simple]] left $R$-[[module]] $M$, $r M =0$.
2. Each [[maximal ideal|maximal]] left [[ideal]] of $R$ contains $r$.
3. For all $x\in R$, $1 - r x$ is left [[invertible element|invertible]] in $R$.

Alternatively,

4. $J(R)$ is the intersection of all maximal left ideals of $R$.
5. $J(R)$ is the intersection of all maxaimal right ideals of $R$. 

The properties required remain the same if one interchanges left and right (modules, invertibility etc.) i.e. $J(R)=J(R^{op})$.

$J(R)$ is a $2$-sided [[ideal]] in $R$. The rings for which $J(R)=0$ are called __semiprimitive rings__. In other words, for each nonzero element $r$ in a semiprimitive ring, by the definition, there is a simple module left annihilated by $r$.
Given any ring $R$, the [[quotient object|quotient]] $R/J(R)$ is semiprimitive.
