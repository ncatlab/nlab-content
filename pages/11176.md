## Considering how type theory can be used in quantum computing ##

__This page is a work in progress.__


### Idea ###

Apply type theory to quantum computing to obtain interesting results/algorithms/lower bounds/etc.


### Todo ###
 * What do we mean by "type theory"?
 * What results could be hope to replicate? Obtain?
 * How will this be used? As a simple tool when checking proofs, or say as a way of deriviing results? Does it matter?


### Areas to consider applying this to ###
 * Hamiltonian complexity?
 * Computational-complexity phase transitions?
    * [Transitions in the quantum computational power](http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.4390)
    * [On the Phase Structure of Commuting Matrix Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.2476)
