Given a [[set]] $A$, the __empty subset__ of $A$, denoted $\empty_A$, is the [[subset]] of $A$ defined by the property that, for every [[element]] $x$ of $A$, it is [[false]] that $x$ belongs to $\empty_A$.

The underlying set (or _shadow_) of any empty subset is [[the]] [[empty set]].  That is, if we interpret $\empty_A$ as an [[injective function]] $S \hookrightarrow A$, then the [[source]] $S$ of this function is the empty set.

In the usual framework of [[material set theory]], every empty subset is identical to the empty set.  For this reason, it is common to write simply $\empty$ instead of $\empty_A$.  Even from a [[structural set theory|structural]] perspective, this is an abuse of language that is unlikely to cause any confusion.
