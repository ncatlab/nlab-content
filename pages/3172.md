**&#201;lie Joseph Cartan** was a French [[differential geometry|differential geometer]]. His results include the classification of complex semisimple [[Lie algebras]] ("Cartan classification"), extension of these results to a class of symmetric spaces, the proof of the Lie--Cartan theorem (after Serre sometimes called "[[Lie's three theorems|Lie's third theorem]]") on integration of Lie algebras to Lie groups (Lie proved just the integration to [[local Lie group]]s), the method of moving frames, the introduction of Cartan's connection, numerous results in [[Riemannian geometry]], results related to the formal integrability of PDEs (Cartan involutive equations, Pfaffian system), etc. 

Father of [[Henri Cartan]].
