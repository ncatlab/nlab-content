## Idea

In abstractly generality, a _differential cohomology diagram_ is the hexagonal [[diagram]] in a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] formed by the two [[fracture squares]] of the [[unit of a monad|unit]] and [[counit of a comonad|counit]] of, respectively, the [[shape modality]] $\Pi$ and the [[flat modality]] $\flat$. The exactness properties of this diagram for any [[stable homotopy type]] $\hat E$ in the corresponding [[tangent cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] express $\hat E$ as being the [[coefficients]] for a [[differential cohomology]] refinement by differential form data $\flat_{dR} \Sigma \hat E$ of the [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology theory]] which is [[Brown representability theorem|represented]] by the [[shape modality|shape]] [[spectrum]] $E \coloneqq \Pi(\hat E)$.

Historically, it had been shown in ([Simons-Sullivan 07](#SimonsSullivan07)) for [[ordinary differential cohomology]] and in ([Freed-Lott 10](#FreedLott10), [Simons-Sullivan 08](#SimonsSullivan08)) for [[differential K-theory]] that these cohomology theories are characterized as sittin in the middle of a hexagonal [[diagram]] of interlocking [[exact sequences]] of [[cohomology groups]], which expresses on the one hand how every differential cohomology class has underlying it a non-differential cohomology class ("of a [[principal ∞-bundle]]") as well as a [[curvature]] [[differential form]] datum, and on the other hand how the special cases of trivial underlying classes equipped with differential form datum and of [[flat connection|flat]] differential form data sit inside the differential cohomology classes.

At this schematic conceptual level a differential cohomology diagram looks as follows

$$
  \array{
    &&  connection\;on\;trivial\;bundle && \stackrel{de\;Rham\;differential}{\longrightarrow} && differential\;forms
    \\
    & \nearrow & & \searrow & & \nearrow_{curvature} && \searrow
    \\
    flat\;differential\;forms  && && geometric\;bundle\;with \;connection && && rationalized\;bundle
    \\
    & \searrow &  & \nearrow & & \searrow^{\mathrlap{}} && \nearrow_{\mathrlap{Chern\;character}}
    \\
    && geometric\;bundle\;with\;flat\;connection && \underset{}{\longrightarrow} && shape\;of\;bundle
  }
$$

One characteristic property is that the two outer sequences are [[exact sequences]]. This expresses (at this rough schematic level) for instance (for the upper part) that the connections $A$ on trivial bundles whose curvature vanishes in that $\mathbf{d}A = 0$, are exactly the flat connections; as well as (for the lower part) that bundles with [[flat connections]] have [[torsion subgroup|torsion]] Chern-clases.

So a [[differential cohomology]] theory would be one whose [[cocycles]]/[[cohomology classes]] have the interpretation of (stable) [[principal ∞-bundles]] with [[connection on an ∞-bundle|connection]] such as in the middle of this diagram.

The characterization/construction of [[differential cohomology]] via [[homotopy fiber products]] (of [[mapping spectra]] with [[differential form]] data) due to ([Hopkins-Singer 02](#HopkinsSinger02)) provides an incarnation of this kind of diagram genuinely in [[stable homotopy theory]], so that the outer parts are indeed [[homotopy fiber sequences]] and the two squares are homotopy cartesion (are [[homotopy pullbacks]]/[[homotopy pushouts]]).

In ([Bunke-Nikolaus-Völkl 13](#BunkeNikolausVoelkl13)) it was observed (see [Schreiber 13, section 4.1.2](#Schreiber13) for the generality in which we present this here) that every [[stable homotopy type]] $\hat E$ in a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$ canonically sits inside a diagram of this form, being formed from the [[fracture squares]] of the units and counits of the [[shape modality]] $\Pi$ and the [[flat modality]] $\flat$:

$$
  \array{
    &&  \Pi_{dR} \Omega {\hat E} && \longrightarrow && \flat_{dR}\Sigma {\hat E}
    \\
    & \nearrow & & \searrow & & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\theta_{\hat E}}} && \searrow
    \\
    \flat \Pi_{dR} \Omega {\hat E}  && && {\hat E} && && \Pi \flat_{dR} \Sigma \hat E
    \\
    & \searrow &  & \nearrow & & \searrow && \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\Pi \theta_{\hat E}}}
    \\
    && \flat {\hat E} && \longrightarrow && \Pi \hat E
  }
  \,.
$$

This is theorem \ref{TheDifferentialDiagram} below.

For the special case that $\mathbf{H} = T Smooth\infty Grpd$ is the [[tangent (∞,1)-topos]] of [[smooth ∞-groupoids]] ([[∞-stacks]] over the [[site]] of [[smooth manifolds]]) this subsumes the cases mentioned above. But there are many examples of cohomology theories not of the form of ([Hopkins-Singer 02](#HopkinsSinger02)) but represented by [[stable homotopy types]] in a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] (see [Schreiber 13](#Schreiber13), [BunkeNikolausVölkl 13](#BunkeNikolausVoelkl13)) and hence fitting into such a diagram, where the interpretation of the pieces of the diagram is just as it should be. 


Therefore it makes sense to define generally that a _differential cohomology diagram_ is the above combined [[fracture squares]] with its outer [[homotopy fiber sequences]] for [[shape modality]] and [[flat modality]] in any [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]].

## Definition/Construction

Let $\mathbf{H}$ be a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]], write $T\mathbf{H}$ for its [[tangent cohesive (∞,1)-topos]] and write $T_\ast \mathbf{H}$ for the [[stable (∞,1)-category]] of [[spectrum objects]] inside it.

Write $\Pi$ for the _stabilized_ [[shape modality]] and $\flat$ for the [[flat modality]] of $Stabl(\mathbf{H}) \hookrightarrow  T \mathbf{H}$, respectively. Write $\flat_{dR}$ for the [[homotopy fiber]] of the $\flat$-[[counit of a comonad|counit]] and $\Pi_{dR}$ for the [[homotopy cofiber]] of the [[unit of a monad|unit]] of $\Pi$. Write 

$$
  \theta \;\colon\; \Omega \longrightarrow \flat_{dR} 
$$

for the canonical morphism (itself the [[homotopy fiber]] of $\flat_{dR} \to \flat$) which has the interpretation of being the [[Maurer-Cartan form]].

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition


For every $A \in T_\ast \mathbf{H}$ the [[natural transformation|naturality square]] 

$$
  \array{
    A &\stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}& A/\flat A
    \\
    \downarrow &{}^{(pb)}& \downarrow
    \\
    \Pi(A) &\stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}& \Pi(A/\flat A)
  }
$$

(of the [[shape modality]] applied to the [[homotopy cofiber]] of the [[counit of a comonad|counit]] of the [[flat modality]]) is an [[(∞,1)-pullback]] square.

=--

This was observed in ([Bunke-Nikolaus-Völkl 13](#BunkeNikolausVoelkl13)). It is an incarnation of a [[fracture theorem]].

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof 

By [[cohesive (infinity,1)-topos|cohesion]] and [[stable (infinity,1)-category|stability]] we have the diagram

$$
  \array{
    \flat A &\longrightarrow & A &\stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}& A/\flat A
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}} && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \Pi(\flat A) &\longrightarrow& \Pi(A) &\stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}& \Pi(A/\flat A)
  }
$$

where both rows are [[homotopy fiber sequences]]. By [[cohesive (infinity,1)-topos|cohesion]] the left vertical map is an [[equivalence in an (infinity,1)-category|equivalence]]. The claim now follows with the [homotopy fiber characterization](homotopy+pullback#HomotopyFiberCharacterization) of [[homotopy pullbacks]].

=--

+-- {: .num_remark}
###### Remark


This means that in stable cohesion every cohesive stable homotopy type is in controled sense a cohesive extension/refinement of its [[geometric realization of cohesive infinity-groupoids|geometric realization]] [[discrete infinity-groupoid|geometrically discrete]] ("bare") stable [[homotopy type]] by the non-[[discrete object|discrete]] part of its cohesive structure;

In particular, $A/\flat A$ may be identified with differential cycle data. Indeed, by stability and cohesion it is the [flat de Rham coefficient object](cohesive+%28infinity,1%29-topos+--+structures#deRhamCohomology)


$$
  A/\flat A = \flat_{dR}\Sigma A
$$

of the [[suspension]] of $A$, and the map to this quotient is thus the [[Maurer-Cartan form]] $\theta_A$. So

$$
  \array{
    A &\stackrel{\theta_A}{\longrightarrow}& \flat_{dR}\Sigma A
    \\
    \downarrow &{}^{(pb)}& \downarrow
    \\
    \Pi(A) &\stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}& \Pi(A/\flat A)
  }
$$

exhibits $A$ as a [[differential cohomology]]-coefficient of the [[generalized cohomology theory]] $\Pi(A)$.

It follows by the discussion at [[schreiber:differential cohomology in a cohesive topos]] that the further differential refinement $\hat{A}$ of $A$ should be given by a further [[homotopy pullback]]

$$
  \array{
    \hat{A} &\longrightarrow& \Omega^1(-,Lie(A))
    \\
    \downarrow &{}^{(pb)}& \downarrow
    \\
    A &\stackrel{\theta_A}{\longrightarrow}& \flat_{dR}\Sigma A
    \\
    \downarrow &{}^{(pb)}& \downarrow
    \\
    \Pi(A) &\stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}& \Pi(A/\flat A)
  }
  \,.
$$

But of course by the generality of the above  proposition, such an $\hat{A}$ sits itself again in its fracture-like pullback diagram.

=--

Dually:

+-- {: .num_prop}
###### Proposition

For every $A \in T_\ast \mathbf{H}$ the [[natural transformation|naturality square]] 

$$
  \array{
    \flat(\Pi_{dR} \Sigma^{-1} A) &\longrightarrow & \Pi_{dR}(\Sigma^{-1} A)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \flat A &\stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}& A 
  }
$$

(of the [[flat modality]] applied to the [[homotopy fiber]] of the [[unit of a monad|unit]] of the [[shape modality]]) is an [[(∞,1)-pullback]] square.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof 

As before but dually, the diagram extends to a morphism of 
[[homotopy cofiber]] diagrams of the form

$$
  \array{
    \flat(\Pi_{dR} \Sigma^{-1} A) &\longrightarrow & \Pi_{dR}(\Omega A)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \flat A &\stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}& A 
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow 
    \\
    \flat \Pi(A) &\stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}& \Pi(A) 
  }
  \,,
$$

and by [[cohesion]] the bottom horizontal morphism is an [[equivalence in an (infinity,1)-category|equivalence]].

=--

Combining these two statements yields the following ([Bunke-Nikolaus-Völkl 13](#BunkeNikolausVoelkl13)).

+-- {: .num_theorem #TheDifferentialDiagram}
###### Theorem

For $\mathbf{H}$ a [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos]]
every [[stable homotopy type]] $A \in Stab(\mathbf{H}) \hookrightarrow T \mathbf{H}$ sits inside a hexagonal [[diagram]] -- the _diferential cohomology hexagon_ -- of the form

$$
  \array{
    &&  \Pi_{dR} \Omega A && \longrightarrow && \flat_{dR}\Sigma A
    \\
    & \nearrow & & \searrow & & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\theta_A}} && \searrow
    \\
    \flat \Pi_{dR} \Omega A  && \Downarrow^{\mathrlap{a}} && A && \Downarrow^{\mathrlap{b}} && \Pi \flat_{dR}\Sigma A
    \\
    & \searrow &  & \nearrow & & \searrow && \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\Pi \theta_A}}
    \\
    && \flat A && \longrightarrow && \Pi A
  }
  \,,
$$

where 

1. the two squares are [[homotopy pullback]] squares, 

1. the two diagonals are the [[homotopy fiber sequences]] of the [[Maurer-Cartan form]] $\theta_A$ and its dual 

1. the bottom morphism is the canonical [points-to-pieces transform](cohesive%20topos#CanonicalComparison)

1. the top and bottom outer sequences are long [[homotopy fiber sequences]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof 

Only the last statement remains to be shown, for that use the [[pasting law]]: this gives the following diagram in which every square and every [[pasting diagram|pasting]] rectangle is a [[homotopy pullback]]

$$
  \array{
    \flat \Pi_{dR} \Omega A  &\to & \flat A  &\to& 0
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f_1}} &\swArrow_{\mathrlap{a^{-1}}}& \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \Pi_{dR} \Omega A  &\stackrel{f_{2}}{\to}& A &\stackrel{\theta_A}{\to}& \flat_{dR} \Sigma A
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow & \swArrow_{\mathrlap{b}} & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f_3}}
    \\
    0 &\to& \Pi A &\to& \Pi \flat_{dR}\Sigma A
  }
  \,.
$$

This exhibits the sequence  $\stackrel{f_1}{\to}\stackrel{\theta_A \circ f_{2}}{\longrightarrow} \stackrel{f_3}{\to}$, which is the top part of the hexagon, as a [[homotopy fiber sequence]].

The dual argument shows that the bottom part of the hexagon is a [[homotopy cofiber sequence]].

## Examples

### Ordinary differential cohomology

We discuss differential refinements in $\mathbf{H} =$ [[Smooth∞Grpd]] of [[ordinary cohomology]], hence of cohomology with [[coefficients]] in [[chain complexes]] or equivalently, via the [[stable Dold-Kan correspodnence]], cohomology [[Brown representability theorem|represented]] by [[spectra]] underlying [[Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum]]-[[module spectra]].

#### De Rham coefficients

We briefly recall the [[smooth spectra]] given by the [[de Rham complex]] (tensored with any [[chain complex]]) from _[smooth spectrum -- Examples -- De Rham spectra](smooth+spectrum#ExamplesDeRhamSpectra)_.

Write $Ch_\bullet$ for the [[(∞,1)-category of chain complexes]] (of [[abelian groups]], hence over the [[ring]] $\mathbb{Z}$ of [[integers]]). It is convenient to choose for $A_\bullet \in Ch_\bullet$ the grading convention

$$
  \array{
    \vdots
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    A_{-1}
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    A_0
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    A_1
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    \vdots
   }
$$

such that under the [[stable Dold-Kan correspondence]] 

$$
  DK \;\colon\; Ch_\bullet \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow} Spectra
$$

the [[homotopy groups]] of spectra relate to the [[homology groups]] by

$$
  \pi_n(DK(A_\bullet)) \simeq  H_{-n}(A_\bullet)
  \,.
$$

In particular for $A \in $ [[Ab]] an [[abelian group]] then $A[n]$ denotes the chain complex concentrated on $A$ in degree $-n$ in this counting.

The grading is such as to harmonize well with the central example of a sheaf of chain complexes over the site of [[smooth manifolds]], which is the [[de Rham complex]], regarded as a [[smooth spectrum]] via the discussion at _[smooth spectrum -- from chain complexes of smooth modules](smooth+spectrum#FromChainComplexesOfSmoothModules)_

$$
  \Omega^\bullet \in Sh_\infty(SmthMfd, Ch_\bullet) \longrightarrow Sh_\infty(SmthMfd, Spectra) \hookrightarrow T \mathbf{H}
$$

$$
  \Omega^{\bullet} \;\colon\;  X\mapsto (\cdots \to 0 \to 0 \to \Omega^0(X) \stackrel{\mathbf{d}}{\to} \Omega^1(X)\stackrel{\mathbf{d}}{\to} \cdots)
$$

with $\Omega^0(X) = C^\infty(X, \mathbb{R})$ in degree 0.

We also need for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the truncated sheaf of complexes

$$
  \Omega^{\bullet \geq n} \in Sh_\infty(SmthMfd, Ch_\bullet) \longrightarrow Sh_\infty(SmthMfd, Spectra) \hookrightarrow T \mathbf{H}
$$

$$
  \Omega^{\bullet \geq n} \;\colon\;  X\mapsto (\cdots \to 0 \to 0 \to \Omega^n(X) \stackrel{\mathbf{d}}{\to} \Omega^{n+1}(X)\stackrel{\mathbf{d}}{\to} \cdots)
$$

with $\Omega^n(X)$ in degree $n$.

More genereally, for $C \in Ch_\bullet$ any [[chain complex]], there is $(\Omega \otimes C)^{\bullet \geq n}$ given over each manifold $X$ by the [[tensor product of chain complexes]] followed by truncation.

Hence

$$
  (\Omega \otimes C)^{\bullet \geq n}
  = 
  (\cdots \to 0 \to 0 \to \oplus_{k \in \mathbb{N}} \Omega^{k}(X) \otimes C_{n-k} \stackrel{\mathbf{d} \pm d_{C}}{\to} \oplus_{k \in \mathbb{N}} \Omega^{k}(X) \otimes C_{n-k+1}\stackrel{\mathbf{d}\pm d_{C}}{\to} \cdots)
 \,.
$$
