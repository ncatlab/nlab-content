## Definition

The abelian [[cohomology]] of a $k$-[[Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$ with coefficients in the left $\mathfrak{g}$-module $M$ is defined as $H^*_{Lie}(\mathfrak{g},M) = Ext_{U\mathfrak{g}}^*(k,M)$ where $k$ is the ground field understood as a trivial module over the universal enveloping algebra $U\mathfrak{g}$. In particular it is a derived functor. 

Before this approach was advanced in Cartan-Eilenberg's _Homological algebra_, Lie algebra cohomology and homology were defined by Chevalley-Eilenberg with a help of concrete Koszul-type resolution which is in this case a chain complex $Hom_{\mathfrak{g}}(U\mathfrak{g}\otimes_k \Lambda^* \mathfrak{g},M)$ where the first argument $U\mathfrak{g}\otimes_k \Lambda^* \mathfrak{g}$ is naturally equipped with a differential to start with (see below). This first argument underlines a differential graded commutative algebra called the Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra, which is in $n$lab denoted (as well as its higher categorical analogues) by $CE(\mathfrak{g})$. 

There is also [[nonabelian Lie algebra cohomology]]. 

The degree $n$ Lie algebra cohomology with trivial coefficients computes the [[homotopy (as an operation)|homotopy]] classes of $L_\infty$-[[L-∞-algebra|algebra]] morphisms

$$
  \mathfrak{g} \to b^{n-1} \mathfrak{u}(1)
  \,.
$$

See also [[nonabelian Lie algebra cohomology]].

## Extensions
 
Every Lie algebra degree $n$ cocycle $\mu$ gives rise to an extension

$$
  b^{n-2} \mathfrak{u}(1) \to \mathfrak{g}_{\mu}
  \to \mathfrak{g}
$$
