## Idea

A _localization of a module_ is the result of application of an [[additive functor|additive]] [[localization functor]] on a [[category of modules]] over some [[ring]] $R$.

When $R$ is a [[commutative ring]] of functions, and under the [interpretation of modules as generalized vector bundles](module#RelationToVectorBundlesInIntroduction) the _localization_ of a module corresponds to the restriction of the bundle to a subspace of its base space.

## Definition

For $R$ a (possibly noncommutative) unital ring, let $\mathcal{A} = R$[[Mod]] be the [[category]] $R$-[[modules]]. Here $R$ may be the [[structure sheaf]] of some [[ringed topos]] and accordingly the modules may be [[sheaves of modules]].

Consider a [[reflective localization]] functor 

$$
  Q^* = Q^*_\Sigma \colon \mathcal{A}\to \Sigma^{-1}\mathcal{A}
$$ 

with [[right adjoint]] $Q_*$. The application of this functor to a [[module]] $M\in \mathcal{A}$ is some object $Q^*(M)$ in the localized category $\Sigma^{-1}\mathcal{A}$, which is up to isomorphism determined by its image $Q_* Q^*(M)$. 

The __localization map__ is the component of the [[unit of an adjunction|unit of the adjunction]] (usually denoted by $i$, $j$ or $\iota$ in this setup) $\iota_M : M\to Q_* Q^*(M)$.

Depending on an author or a context, we say that a (reflective) localization functor of category of modules is __flat__ if either $Q^*$ is also left [[exact functor]], or more strongly that the composed endofunctor $Q_* Q^*$ is exact. For example, [[Gabriel localization]] is flat in the first, weak sense, and left or right Ore localization is flat in the second, stronger, sense. 


## Properties

By the [[Eilenberg-Watts theorem]], if $\mathcal{A}= R$[[Mod]] then the localization of a module

$$
  Q^*(M) = Q^*(R)\otimes_R M
$$

is given by forming the [[tensor product of modules]] with the localizatin of the ring $R$, regarded as a module over itself.

If the localization is a left [[Ore localization]] or [[commutative localization]] at a set $S\subset R$ then $Q^*(R) = S^{-1} R$ is the [[localization of a ring|localization of the ring]] itself 
and hence in this case the localization of the module 

$$
  Q^*(M) = S^{-1} R\otimes_R M
$$

is given by [[extension of scalars]] along the localization map $R \to S^{-1}R$ of the ring itself.

In these cases there are also direct constructions of $Q^*(M)$ (not using to $Q^*(R)$) which give an isomorphic result, also denoted by $S^{-1}M$.
