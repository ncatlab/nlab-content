## Definition

A [[Lawvere theory]] is encoded in its [[syntactic category]] $T$, a category with finite products such that all objects are finite products of a given object.

An **algebra over a Lawvere theory $T$**, or **$T$-algebra** for short, is a [[model]] for this [[algebraic theory]]: it is a product-preserving [[functor]]

$$
  A : T \to Set
  \,.
$$ 

The [[category]] of $T$-algebras is the [[full subcategory]] of the [[functor category]] on the product-preserving functors

$$
  T Alg := [T,Set]_\times \subset [T,Set]
  \,.
$$

For more discussion, properties and examples see for the moment [[Lawvere theory]].

## Properties

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

The category $T Alg$ has all [[limit]]s and these are computed objectwise, hence the embedding $T Alg \to [T,Set]$ preserves these limits.

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

$T Alg$ is a [[reflective subcategory]] of $[T, Set]$:

$$
  T Alg \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\hookrightarrow} [T,Set]
  \,.
$$

###### Proof

With the above this follows using the [[adjoint functor theorem]].
