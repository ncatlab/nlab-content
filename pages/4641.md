
## Definition

A [[Lawvere theory]] is encoded in its [[syntactic category]] $T$, a category with finite product such that all objects are finite products of a given object.

An **algebra over a Lawvere theory $T$**, or **$T$-algebra** for short, is a [[model]] for this [[algebraic theory]]: it is a product-preserving [[functor]]

$$
  A : T \to Set
  \,.
$$ 

The [[category]] of $T$-algebras is the [[full subcategory]] of the [[functor category]] on the product-preserving functors

$$
  T Alg = [T,Set]_\times \subset [T,Set]
  \,.
$$
