## Idea
 {#Idea}

In [[solid state physics]], a [[phase of matter]] is called *topological* in a given energy bound $\Delta$ (the "gap") if external [[adiabatic theorem|adiabatic]] deformations of the system that are gentle enough not to excite modes beyond energy $\gt \Delta$ above the [[ground state]] leave the properties of the system [[invariant]] if the deformations are small, and have the sole effect of possibly [[unitary operator|transforming]] a (degenerate) [[ground state]] if one goes around in a loop in the space of such deformations, this transformation then being a function only of the [[homotopy class]] of that loop.

Concretely, a [[crystal|crystalline]] material which is an [[insulator]] in that its [[chemical potential]] lies entirely in a gap between two [[electronic energy bands]] (then called the *[[valence band]]* and the *[[conduction band]]*) has a well-defined [[valence bundle]] of filled [[Bloch states]] over its [[Brillouin torus]], and the ([[twisted equivariant K-theory|twisted equivariant]]) [[topological K-theory]]-class of this bundle is thought to be an invariant of the system under all gentle external deformations that do not cause excitations above the gap size. If this class is non-trivial, then such a material is said to be in a [[topological insulator]]-phase, now a prime example of a topological phase of matter. See also at *[[K-theory classification of topological phases of matter]]*.

More generally, if there is such a gap *except* over a [[codimension]]$\geq 2$ [[submanifold]] of "nodal loci" inside the [[Brillouin torus]] where it closes right at the [[chemical potential]], then the [[valence bundle]] is well-defined (only) on the [[complement]] of these "nodal" points as before and as such again invariant under gentle deformations, but now these external deformations may move the position of the nodal points. In this case one speaks of a *topological [[semi-metal]]*-phase. If a loop of such deformations has the effect of [[braid group|braiding]] these nodal points around each other then it may in total have the effect of having transformed the [[ground state]] by an operation in a [[braid group representation]]. If this is non-abelian, it follows in particular that the ground state is "degenerate", hence has "multiplicity", hence that there is a [[Hilbert space]] of states, all of the ground state energy at the chemical potential, whose [[dimension of a vector space|dimension]] is $\gt 1$. 

The first and archetypical example of both these special cases of topological phases of matter is seen in *[[graphene]]*, where a band gap *almost* closes over two *[[Dirac points]]* (up to a tiny lift by the [[spin-orbit coupling]]).

Technically one says that the topological order of graphene is "symmetry protected", because any [[complex vector bundle]] (such as the [[valence bundle]] may naively seem to be) is necessarily [[trivial bundle|trivial]] over the [[complement]] of two Dirac points inside the Brillouin [[2-torus]] (a punctured torus, see [[torus#AsAHomotopyType|here]]), but the dynamics of electrons in graphene is "$T I$"-symmetric which forces the valence bundle to be a [[real vector bundle]] with a class not in [[KU-theory]] but in [[KO-theory]], which can be non-trivial over a punctured torus (see at *[[Möbius strip]]*). This non-triviality of the $T I$-symmetric valence bundles is exhibited by non-trivial [[Berry phases]] around the two nodal points.

Generally, it is expected that [[codimension]]=2 [[defects]] in a topological state of matter exhibit such a ([[symmetry protected topological order|symmetry protected]]) *[[topological order]]* in that the [[adiabatic theorem|adiabatic]] [[braid group|braiding]] of them around each other inside the topological host material constitutes a [[braid group representation]] on the systems [[ground state]]. In this case one refers to these defects also a *[[anyons]]*. The idea to use the [[braid representations]] that these form as [[quantum gates]] in a [[quantum computer]] underlies the subject of [[topological quantum computation]].

## Relation between SPT order and topological order

This entry refers both [[topological order]] and [[SPT order]], and here is an comparison between them.

* Both [[topological order]] and [[SPT order]] are beyond Landau symmetry breaking theory.

* [[SPT state]]s are short-range entangled while [[topological order|topologically ordered]] states are long-range entangled. 

* Topologically ordered states have emergent fractional charge, emergent fractional statistics, and emergent gauge theory. In contrast, SPT states have no emergent fractional charge/fractional statistics for finite-energy excitations, nor emergent gauge theory (due to their short-ranged entanglement).

* SPT orders are described by group cohomology theory while [[topological order]]s are
described by n-category theory. The SPT orders for free fermions are described by K-theory.
