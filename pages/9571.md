## Idea

The _Grothendieck-Teichmüller tower_ construction involves [[moduli spaces]] outlined in [[Grothendieck]]'s _Esquisse d'un programme_ and then developed by [[Vladimir Drinfel'd]] and others. It involves the [[Teichmüller groupoids]] which are the [[fundamental groupoids]] of [[moduli stacks]] of [[genus]] $g$ [[curves]] with $n$ points removed. It is a basis for the definition of the _Grothendieck-Teichmüller group_ which is by the definition inertia-preserving [[automorphism group]] of the Grothendieck-Teichmüller tower. 

## Properties

### Relation to the motivic Galois group

The Grothendieck-Teichmüller group is supposed to be a [[quotient]] of the [[motivic Galois group]]. This is a conjecture due to ([Drinfeld 91](#Drinfeld91)). 

### Relation to the graph complex
 {#RelationToTheGraphComplex}

The Grothendieck-Teichmüller Lie algebra is isomorphic to the 0th cohomology of [[Kontsevich]]'s [[graph complex]] ([Willwacher 10](#Willwacher10)). 




### Relation to deformation quantization and the cosmic Galois group

[[Grothendieck]] predicted that the GT group is closely related to the absolute Galois group. [[Maxim Kontsevich]] later conjectured its [[action]] on certain space of [[quantum field theories]] and outlined its [[motivic cohomology|motivic]] aspects. 

This was later proven by [[Vasily Dolgushev]], see at _[formal deformation quantization -- Motivic Galois group action on the space of quantizations](deformation+quantization#MotivicGaloisGroup)_ for details and pointers.

For more see also at _[[cosmic Galois group]]_ for more on this.
