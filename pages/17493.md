## Idea and benefits

The proof-theoretic ordinal of a theory $T$ is commonly defined as

$$ {\vert T\vert} = \sup\{ \mathrm{otyp}({\prec}) \mid {\prec}\text{is primitive recursive and}\;
 T \vdash \mathrm{TI}({\prec},X) \}$$

where $\mathrm{otyp}({\prec})$ is the order-type of the well-order
$\prec$. For most theories, this is equal to the $\Pi^1_1$-ordinal of
the theory,

$$ {\vert T\vert}_{\Pi^1_1} := \sup\{ \mathrm{tc}(F) \mid F\;\text{is a}\;\Pi^1_1\text{-sentence and }\;
 T \vdash F \}$$

where $\mathrm{tc}(F)$ is the truth-complexity of the
$\Pi^1_1$-sentence $F$ (if $T$ is a first-order theory, we interpret
$T \vdash \forall X.F(X)$ as $T \vdash F(X)$ with a free set parameter
$X$).

The proof-theoretic ordinal is always a recursive ordinal ($\lt\omega_1^{\mathrm{CK}}$) if the theory is recursive.

Note that the proof-theoretic ordinal is a rather blunt invariant, because if $F$ is any true $\Sigma^1_1$-sentence, then

$$ {\vert T\vert}_{\Pi^1_1} = {\vert T+F\vert}_{\Pi^1_1} $$

So this tells us nothing about the provable arithmetical sentences of
$T$! And indeed, all true arithmetical sentences have truth-complexity
less than $\omega$.

The solution is to refine the analysis to give a $\Pi^0_2$ ordinal
analysis of the theory, using a measure of the computational
complexity of provable $\Pi^0_2$-sentences/provably recursive
functions. However, there's no natural hierarchy of all subrecursive
functions. We can define such a computational complexity depending on a
choice of starting function and a choice of ordinal notation system
(indeed, the $\Pi^0_2$ ordinal should be thought of as an ordinal
notation, rather than an actual ordinal). But for all the ordinal
analyses we have so far, these choices turn out not to matter,
basically because any _natural ordinal notation system_ will give the
same result. A major issue is, however, that we have no definition of
what a natural ordinal notation system is (but we know one when we see
it!).

All of the ordinal analyses mentioned below also give a $\Pi^0_2$
ordinal analysis, and thus control of the computational complexity of
the provably recursive functions.

## Methods

### Upper bounds

Most ordinal analyses proceed by embedding the theory in an infinitary
proof calculus deriving judgments $\vdash^\alpha_\rho F$ meaning $F$
has an infinitary derivation of height less than $\alpha$ using only
cuts of rank less than $\rho$, or some refinement of such, for
instance using operator controlled derivations. Then one analyses how
the height of a derivation changes during cut-elimination. For
predicative theories, we'll have

$$ \vdash^\alpha_\rho \Delta \Rightarrow \vdash^{\varphi\rho\alpha}_0 \Delta $$

One sets up the calculus so that $\vdash^\alpha_0 F$ implies
$\mathrm{tc}(F)\lt\alpha$, so this yields upper bounds for the
proof-theoretic ordinal.

### Lower bounds

Lower bounds are usually done by directly deriving
$T \vdash \mathrm{TI}({\prec_n},X)$ for a sequence of primitive recursive
well-orderings $\prec_n$ whose order-types approximate the
proof-theoretic ordinal. We get these primitive recursive
well-orderings from good ordinal notation systems, see below.

The sections of the table corresponds roughly to the kinds of reasoning captured by the systems:

* Finitistic reasoning about the natural numbers (and other finitistic inductive types)
* Predicative reasoning about the natural numbers
* Metapredicative reasoning about the natural numbers
* Reasoning about general inductive types
* Reasoning about general inductive-recursive types

### Ordinal notations

* $\varphi$ is either the binary or the ternary Veblen function
* $\Omega=\Omega_1$ is the first recursively admissible ordinal 
* $\Omega_\xi$ is the $\xi$th recursively admissible ordinal
* $I$ is the first recursively inaccessible ordinal
* $L$ is the limit of the first $\omega$ recursively inaccessible ordinals
* $M$ is the first recursively Mahlo ordinal

The $\psi$ functions are ordinal collapsing functions.

### Systems of first-order arithmetic (FOA)

These assert some hierarchy of inductive defined sets of natural numbers.

* EFA is elementary function arithmetic
* PRA is primitive recursive arithmetic
* PA is first-order Peano arithmetic
* $\widehat{\mathrm{ID}}_\nu$ extends PA by $\nu$ iterated fixed points of monotone operators (not necessarily least).
* ID$_1^#$ is $\widehat{\mathrm{ID}}_1$ with induction only for positive formulas.
* ID$_\nu$ extends PA by $\nu$ iterated least fixed points of monotone operators.

For any of these, we get the same proof-theoretic ordinal whether we
use classical or intuitionistic logic. For the ID$_\nu$-systems, this
is due to Sieg.

The unfolding systems U(PA) and U(ID$_1$) are not exactly first-order
arithmetic systems, but capture what we can get by predicative
reasoning based on the natural numbers or one generalized inductive
definition, respectively.

### Systems of second-order arithmetic (SOA)

* Comprehension or choice principles.
* RCA$_0^*$ is the second-order version of EFA: $\exp$ is a function symbol.
* WKL is weak König's lemma.
* BR is the bar induction rule.
* BI is the bar induction axiom.
* ATR is arithmetical transfinite recursion.
* (M) says every true $\Pi^1_3$ sentence with parameters holds in a $\beta$-model of $\Delta^1_2$-CA.

A zero subscript indicates that we have the induction axiom rather
than the induction scheme, except for RCA$_0$ which has the
$\Sigma^0_1$-induction scheme.

### Kripke Platek Set theories

* KP$\omega$ is Kripke-Platek set theory, whose universe is an admissible set containing $\omega$.
* KPl asserts that the universe is a limit of admissible sets
* KPi asserts that the universe is inaccessible sets
* KPh asserts that the universe is hyperinaccessible: a limit of inaccessible sets
* KPm asserts that the universe is a Mahlo set

A superscript zero indidcates that $\in$-induction is removed.

About the Mahlo level: this also corresponds to inductive-recursive definitions (Dybjer-Setzer).

### Martin-Löf type theories

* CPRC is the Herbelin-Patey Calculus of Primitive Recursive Constructions.
* ML$_n$ is type theory without W-types with $n$ universes.
* ML$_{\lt\omega}$ is type theory without W-types with an infinite hierarchy of universes.
* MLU is type theory with a next universe operator.
* MLS is type theory without W-types with a superuniverse.
* ML$_1$V is type theory with one universe and Aczel's type of iterative sets.
* ML$_1$W is type theory with W-types and one universe.
* ML$_{\lt\omega}$ is type theory with W-types and an infinite hierarchy of universes (this corresponds to the type theory in Lean's HoTT mode).
* MLM is Martin-Löf type theory with a Mahlo universe.

### Constructive Set theories

* CZF is Aczel's constructive set theory.
* REA is the regular extension axiom. 
* CZFM is CZF with a Mahlo universe

### Explicit mathematics systems

* EM$_0$ is basic explicit mathematics with elementary comprehension
* JR is the join rule, J is the join axioms
* T$_0$ is EM$_0$+J+IG, where IG is inductive generation
