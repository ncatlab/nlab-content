## Definition

For $n \in \mathbb{Z}$,  the $n$-**Betti number** of a [[chain complex]] $V$ (of [[module]]s over a [[ring]] $R$) is the [[rank]] 

$$
  b_n(V) := rk_R H_n(V)
$$

of its $n$th [[homology group]], regarded as an $R$-[[module]].

For $X$ a [[topological space]], its $n$th Betti number is that of its [[singular homology]]-complex

$$
  b_n(V) = rk_R H_n(X, R)
  \,.
$$

For $X$ moreover a [[smooth manifold]] then by the [[de Rham theorem]] this is equivalently the dimenion of the [[de Rham cohomology]] groups.

## Properties

### Euler characteristic

The alternating sum of all the Betti numbers is -- if it exists -- the [[Euler characteristic]].
