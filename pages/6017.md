## Idea

A _Crane-Yetter model_ is a [[sigma-model]] [[quantum field theory]] whose target space is a [[discrete infinity-groupoid|discrete]] [[2-groupoid]] and whose background [[gauge field]] is a [[circle n-bundle|circle 4-bundle]].

Together with the [[Dijkgraaf-Witten theory|Dijkgraaf-Witten model]] these form the first two steps in filtering of target spaces by [[homotopy type]] [[truncated|truncation]] of [[schreiber:∞-Chern-Simons theory]] <a href="http://nlab.mathforge.org/schreiber/show/infinity-Chern-Simons+theory#DiscreteTargets">with discrete target spaces</a>.


## Definition

Fix

* $G$ a [[discrete infinity-groupoid|discrete]] [[2-group]]; write $\mathbf{B}G$ for its [[delooping]] [[2-groupoid]];

* $\alpha : \mathbf{B}G \to \mathbf{B}^4 U(1)$ a [[characteristic class]] with coefficients in the [[circle n-group|circle 4-group]]. This is equivalently a cocycle in degree $4$ [[group cohomology]]

  $$
    [\alpha] \in H_{Grpd}^4(G, U(1))
    \,.
  $$ 

The **Crane-Yetter-model** is the <a href="http://nlab.mathforge.org/schreiber/show/infinity-Chern-Simons+theory#DiscreteTargets">∞-Dijkgraaf-Witten theory</a> induced by this data.

parts of Yetter's original theory are studied, but with the inclusion of the background gauge field.
