## Idea

In  [[particle physics]] [[phenomenology]], the term _split supersymmetry_ refers to [[model (physics)|models]] of [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] extensions of the [[standard model of particle physics]] whose [[supersymmetry breaking]]-scale is at very high scale (for instance a [[GUT]] scale of about $10^{15}$ [[GeV]]) than the [[electroweak symmetry breaking]]-[[scale]] (of about 246 [[GeV]]), but such that approximate [[chiral symmetry]] [[protection from quantum corrections|protext]] the [[masses]] of the [[fermion|fermionic]] [[superpartners]].

As a result, in such [[model (physics)|models]] there is a "split" of the [[mass]] [[scales]] of

1. the [[scalar field|scalar]] [[superpartners]] ([[squarks]] and [[sleptons]]) have high [[rest masses]], from tens of [[TeV]] (mass scale of the [[gravitino]]) up to the [[supersymetry breaking]]-scale many order of magnitudes higher,

1. the [[fermion]] [[superpartners]] ([[gauginos]] and [[higgsino]]) have masses much closer to the [[electroweak symmetry breaking]] scale, at about one [[TeV]].

([Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos, Giudice, Romanino 05, p 2.](#ArkaniHamedDimopoulosGiudiceRomanino05))

Therefore one speaks of "split supersymmetry".

Historically, the consideration of split supersymmetry models was in contrast to the folklore of "[[naturalness]]" which governed [[supersymmetry]] [[model (physics)|model]]-building. It was motivated by the observation that many other theoretical problems of low-scale susy models disappear if one does not insist on naturalness But after the [[LHC]] [[experiment]] produced first observational results, susy models exhibiting "[[naturalness]]" were ruled out, while only split supersymmetry models remained viable (this as of beginning of 2018)

## Examples

The class of [[model (physics)|physics]] called [[G2-MSSM]] generically exhibit "slightly" split supersymmetry.
