The $n$-dimensional unit __sphere__, or simply $n$-sphere, is the [[subset]] of the $(n+1)$-dimensional [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbf{R}^{n+1}$ consisting of all points $x$ whose distance from the origin is $1$:
$$ S^n = \{ x: \mathbf{R}^{n+1} \;|\; \|x\| = 1 \} .$$
The $n$-dimensional sphere of radius $r$ is
$$ S^n_r = \{ x: \mathbf{R}^{n+1} \;|\; \|x\| = r \} .$$
Topologically, this is equivalent to the unit sphere for $r \gt 0$, or a [[point]] for $r = 0$.

These spheres, or rather their underlying [[topological space]]s or [[simplicial set]]s, are fundamental in (ungeneralised) [[homotopy theory]].  In a sense, [[Whitehead's theorem]] says that these are all that you need; no further [[generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) homotopy theory|generalised homotopy theory]] (in a sense [[Eckmann-Hilton duality|dual]] to [[Eilenberg–Steenrod cohomology theory]]) is needed.

One can also talk about a sphere in an arbitrary (possibly infinite-dimensional) [[Banach space]] $V$:
$$ S(V) = \{ x: V \;|\; \|x\| = 1 \} .$$
But this provides nothing new to homotopy theory, as an infinite-dimensional sphere is [[contractible space|contractible]].

Is there a nice formula for this?  If so, it would be good to write it down here.

The $n$-sphere is the boundardy of the $(n+1)$-[[ball]].


## Low dimensions

*  The $(-1)$-sphere is the [[empty space]].
*  The $0$-sphere is the [[point]].
*  The $1$-sphere is the [[circle]].
*  The $2$-sphere is usual sphere from ordinary geometry.

Note that this violates the convention that a $1$-foo is a foo; instead the ruling convention being used is that an $n$-foo has dimension $n$.  One could follow both by saying ‘$n$-circle’ instead, although this might get confused with the $n$-[[torus]].
