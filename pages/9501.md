## Idea

In [[foliation]]-theory the _Bott connection_ is a certain characteristic canonucal on the [[conormal bundle]] of the [[foliation]].

## Definition

###### Definition

For $X$ a [[smooth manifold]] and $\mathcal{P} \hookrightarrow T X$ a [[foliation]] of $X$, incarnated as a subbundle of the [[tangent bundle]], the corresponding [[conormal bundle]]

$$
  \mathcal{P}^\perp  \hookrightarrow T^* X
$$

is the annihilator of $\mathcal{P}$ under the pairing of covectors with vectors. The corresponding **Bott connection** is the [[covariant derivative]] of vectors $X \in \Gamma(\mathcal{P})$ on covectors $\xi \in \Gamma(\mathcal{P}^\perp)$ given by the [[Lie derivative]]

$$
  \nabla_X \;\colon\; \xi \mapsto \mathcal{L}_X \xi = \iota_X d_{dR} \xi
  \,.
$$

Similarly there is a Bott connection along $\mathcal{P}$ along the [[normal bundle]] $T X / \mathcal{P}$. More generally, one speaks of _a Bott connection_ for any connection on the (co)normal bundle and defined on all vector fields on $X$ which restricts to the above along leaves.
