## Idea 

A _derived stack_ is an [[∞-stack]] -- an [[(∞,1)-sheaf]] -- whose domain is not a [[1-category]] but more generally an [[(∞,1)-category]].

One says _derived stack_ in order to distinguish from the traditional notion of [[∞-stack]] which is an [[(∞,1)-sheaf]] whose domain is still a 1-categorical [[site]].

For recall that a [[sheaf]] is a [[functor]] $F : C^{op} \to Set$ satisfying some [[descent]]-condition.
So there are two steps in which the notion of [[sheaf]] may be [[vertical categorification|categorified]]:

1. the codomain is categorified and the domain remains a 1-category
1. the codomain and the domain are categorified.

The categorification of the codomain leads to the notion of [[stack]]s when [[Set]] replaced by [[Grpd]], and further to [[infinity-stack]]s, when sets are replaced by [[infinity-groupoid]]s. 

But there is no natural reason why the domain should in general remain a 1-category if one passes to an [[infinity-category|infinity-categorical]]-context. A _derived stack_ is a generalization of the notion of sheaf where both domain and codomain are taken to be $\infty$-categorical.

In practice one often looks at the model of derived stacks obtained from generalizing the theory of [[simplicial presheaf|simplicial presheaves]]: so a derived pre-stack is often modeled as a [[SSet]]-[[enriched category theory|enriched]] functor $F : C^{op} \to SSet$ from an [[SSet]]-enriched category to $SSet$.

## Central motivation: derived stacks have good limits

One general idea for the use of higher and derived stacks is that

* passing to a higher categorical codomain  -- i.e. from Set-values [[sheaf|sheaves]] to higher [[groupoid]] valued sheaves -- is a means to obtain _good colimits_, [[colimit]]s that do not lose information. For instance 

  * in the category [[Diff]] of manifolds the quotient by a non-free action of a group may not exist

  * in [[sheaf|sheaves]] in $[Diff^{op},Set]$ it will exist, but will have the wrong properties in general with respect to some operations such as taking cohommology,

  * while finally in [[stack]]s $[Diff^{op}, Grpd]$ it exists as the corresponding smooth [[action groupoid]] or [[orbifold]] and in this form rembers in terms of the isomorphisms how the quotient was obtained. The cohomology of the stack is then indeed the equivariant cohomology of the original manifold.

* similarly passing to higher categorical domain -- i.e. from presheaves on categories to presheaves on higher categories, is analogously a means to ensure that good [[limit]]s exist.

A detailed illustration and motivation of the need of these "good limits" that don't forget the way they were formed is

  * David Spivak, [Quasi-smooth derived manifolds](http://math.berkeley.edu/~dspivak/thesis2.pdf)


## Examples

* passing from [[sheaf|sheaves]] or [[∞-stack]]s on the domain [[CRing]] of commutative rings to the [[simplicially enriched category]] (hence an [[(infinity,1)-category]]) $SimpCRing$ of [[simplicial ring|simplicial commutative rings]] corresponds, under the [[Dold-Kan correspondence]] to passing from spaces with an ordinary function algebra to spaces with a [[differential graded algebra]] as a function algebra.

Derived ($\infty$-)stacks are currently mostly, maybe exclusively, studied on algebraic sites $S$, where the category $S^{op} := $ [[Alg]] is replaced with a category of "$\infty$-algebras" of sorts. The theory of these $\infty$-algebras is described in great detail in
