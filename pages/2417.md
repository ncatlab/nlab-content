on [[geometric models for elliptic cohomology]] with speculations about the formalization of 2-dimensional [[CFT]] as an extended ([[2-functor]]ial) [[FQFT]]. 

In more recent developments the authors exchanged, for technical convenience, the conformal structure in favor of flat [[Riemannian metric|Riemannian structure]] in
