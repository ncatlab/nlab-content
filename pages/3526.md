Pierre Schapira is a french mathematician who developped [[algebraic analysis]] as a member of Sato's school, with main collaborator [[Masaki Kashiwara]]. Together, they developped microlocalization of sheaves and ind-sheaves, expanding Sato's groundbreaking ideas to a complete categorical toolbox to do analysis in a purely (ind)-sheaf theoretical setting.

The theory of [[microlocalization]] of (ind)-sheaves was developped in the following works:


* [[Masaki Kashiwara]], [[Pierre Schapira]], _Ind-sheaves, distributions and microlocalization_, describes the program.
* [[Masaki Kashiwara]], [[Pierre Schapira]], [[Florian Ivorra]], [[Ingo Waschkies]] _Microlocalization of ind-sheaves_, gives the main results
and proofs.
* [[Masaki Kashiwara]], [[Pierre Schapira]] _Ind-sheaves_, SMF, gives a
complete account of the theory.


The two pedagogical books written with Kashiwara:

* [[Masaki Kashiwara]], [[Pierre Schapira]], _Sheaves on manifolds_, Springer
(this book describes, among other topics, the author's theory of microlocalization of sheaves)

* [[Masaki Kashiwara]], [[Pierre Schapira]], _Categories and Sheaves_, Springer (2000)
