## Definition

A __topological abelian group__ (or __TAG__) is a [[topological group]] whose underlying [[group]] is [[abelian group|abelian]].

Topological abelian groups and [[continuous map|continuous]] group [[homomorphisms]] form a [[category]] $Ab Top$.


## Remarks

Often TAGs are easier to understand than arbitrary topological groups, because no distinction need be made between left and right.  For example, a TAG has only one [[uniform space|uniform structure]], a [[locally compact space|locally compact]] TAG has only one [[Haar measure]] (up to scale), etc.


## Applications

TAGs are important in [[analysis]].  For example, every [[topological vector space]] (TVS) is a TAG, and much of the theory of TVSs can be generalised to TAGs.
