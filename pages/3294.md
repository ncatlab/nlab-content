# Fréchet spaces

## Idea

Fréchet spaces are particularly well-behaved [[topological vector spaces]] (TVSes).  Every [[Cartesian space]] is a Fréchet space, but there are also infinite-dimensional examples.  It is possible to do calculus on Fréchet spaces, yet they are more general than [[Banach spaces]]; as such, they are popular as test spaces for possibly infinite-dimensional [[manifolds]]; see [[Fréchet manifold]].

Note that a 'Fréchet topology' on a 'Fréchet topological space' is different; this just means that a [[topological space]] satisfies the $T_1$ [[separation axiom]].  (Like all Hausdorff TVSes, Fréchet spaces satisfy this axiom, but they have a good deal of additional structure and properties.)


## Definition

A __Fréchet space__ is a [[complete space|complete]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[locally convex space]] that is metrisable by a translation-invariant [[metric space|metric]].

Equivalently, a __Fréchet space__ is a complete Hausdroff TVS whose topology may be given (as a [[gauge space]]) by a [[countable set|countable]] family of [[seminormed vector space|seminorms]].

We accept as an [[automorphism]] of Fréchet spaces any linear [[homeomorphism]]; in particular, the particular translation-invariant metric or countable family of seminorms used to prove that a space is a Fréchet space is *not* required to be preserved.  More generally, the [[morphisms]] of Fréchet spaces are the [[continuous map|continuous]] linear maps, so that Fréchet spaces form a [[full subcategory]] of $TVS$.


## Examples

Every [[Banach space]] is a Fréchet space.

If $X$ is a [[compact space|compact]] [[smooth manifold]], then the space of [[smooth map|smooth maps]] on $X$ is a Fréchet space.  This can be extended to some non-compact manifolds, in particular when $X$ is the [[real line]].

The [[Lebesgue space]] $L^p(\mathbb{R})$ is *not* a Fréchet space, because it is not locally convex.
