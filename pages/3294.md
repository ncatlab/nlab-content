## Idea

Fréchet spaces are particularly well-behaved [[topological vector spaces]] (TVSes).  Every [[Cartesian space]] is a Fréchet space, but Fréchet spaces may have infinite [[dimension]].  There is [[analysis]] on Fréchet spaces, yet they are more general than [[Banach spaces]]; as such, they are popular as test spaces for possibly [[infinite-dimensional manifolds]]: _[[Fréchet manifolds]]_.

Beware the clash ofterminology: a 'Fréchet topology' on a 'Fréchet topological space' is something different; this just means that a [[topological space]] satisfies the $T_1$ [[separation axiom]].  (Like all Hausdorff TVSes, Fréchet spaces satisfy this axiom, but they have a good deal of additional structure and properties.)

A basic example of a Fréchet space is $\mathbb{R}^\infty = \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim} \mathbb{R}^n$, as a [[topological space]] the _[[projective limit]]_ over the finite dimensional [[Cartesian spaces]] $\mathbb{R}^n$. This is not a [[Banach space]] anymore, since it does not carry a compatible [[norm]] anymore (e.g. [Saunders 89](#Saunders89), p. 253). But it evidently does carry the functions $\mathbb{R}^\infty \overset{p^n}{\longrightarrow} \mathbb{R}^n \overset{\Vert -\Vert_n}{\longrightarrow} \mathbb{R}$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, where $p^n$ is the defining [[projection]] and where ${\Vert -\Vert}_n$ is the standard [[norm]] on $\mathbb{R}^n$. While not norms, these composites are [[seminorms]] on $\mathbb{R}^\infty$, they only fail the condition that only the 0-vector has vanishing norm. A Fréchet space is equivalently a vector space equipped with a familiy of seminorms, with compatibility conditions modeled on this example.


## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn #DefinitionsFrechetSpaces}
###### Definition


A __Fréchet space__ is equivalently

1. a [[complete space|complete]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[locally convex vector space]] that is [[metric space|metrisable]].  The metric can be chosen to be translation-invariant.

1. a complete Hausdorff TVS whose topology may be given (as a [[gauge space]]) by a [[countable set|countable]] family of [[seminormed vector space|seminorms]].

=--

We accept as an [[automorphism]] of Fréchet spaces any [[linear|linear]] [[homeomorphism]]; in particular, the particular translation-invariant metric or countable family of [[seminorms]] used to prove that a space is a Fréchet space is *not* required to be preserved.  More generally, the [[morphisms]] of Fréchet spaces are the [[continuous map|continuous]] linear maps, so that Fréchet spaces form a [[full subcategory]] of $TVS$.


## Examples

Every [[Banach space]] is a Fréchet space.

If $X$ is a [[compact space|compact]] [[smooth manifold]], then the space of [[smooth map|smooth maps]] on $X$ is a Fréchet space.  This can be extended to some non-compact manifolds, in particular when $X$ is the [[real line]].

The [[Lebesgue space]] $L^p(\mathbb{R})$ for $p \lt 1$ is *not* a Fréchet space, because it is not locally convex.

The direct product of a countable number of copies of $\mathbb{R}$ is a Fréchet space.  Let $\pi_n \colon \prod_k \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^n$ be the projection onto the first $n$ copies and let $\|\cdot\|_n$ be a choice of norm on $\mathbb{R}^n$.  Then a countable family of seminorms on $\prod_k \mathbb{R}$ is given by $v \mapsto {\|\pi_n(v)\|_n}$.

On the other hand, the locally convex direct sum of a countable number of copies of $\mathbb{R}$ is not a Fréchet space.

## Properties
Fréchet spaces are [[barrelled]] and [[bornological]]. 

The dual of a Fréchet space $F$ is a Fréchet space iff $F$ is a [[Banach space]].

Reference: This follows from the statement paragraph 29.1 (7) in Gottfried Koethe: _Topological Vector Spaces I_, which is: The strong dual of a locally convex metrizable TVS $F$ is metrizable iff $F$ is normable.

## Calculus
It is possible to generalize some aspects of calculus to Fréchet spaces, for example the definition of the derivative of a curve is simply the same as in finite dimensions:


+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition
For a continuous path in a Fréchet space $f(t)$ we define
$$
f'(t) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{1}{h} (f(t + h) - f(t))
$$
If the limit exists and is continous, we say that $f$ is continuously differentiably or $C^1$.
=--

And just as in the finite dimensional case, we can define the partial derivative, or rather: the [[directional derivative|directional]] or Gâteaux derivative:

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition
**directional derivative**

Let F and G be Fréchet spaces, $U \subseteq F$ open and $P: U \to G$ a nonlinear continuous map. The derivative of $P$ at the point $f \in U$ in the direction $h \in F$ is the map
$$
D P: U \times F \to G
$$
$$
D P(f) h = \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{1}{t} ( P(f + t h) - P(f))
$$
If the limit exists and is jointly continuous in both variables we say that $P$ is continuous differentiable or $C^1$.
=--

A simple, but nontrivial example is the operator 
$$
P: C^{\infty}[a, b] \to C^{\infty}[a, b]
$$
$$
P(f) \coloneqq f f'
$$
with the derivative
$$
D P(f) h = f'h + f h'
$$

It is possible to generalize the Riemann integral to Fréchet spaces, too: For a continuous path $f(t)$ on an interval $[a, b]$ in a Fréchet space $F$ we look for an element $\int_a^b f(t) d t \in F$. It turns out that such an element exists and is unique, if we impose some properties of the integral known from the finite dimensional case:


+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Theorem
There exists a unique element $\int_a^b f(t) d t \in F$ such that

(i) for every continuous functional $\phi$ we have  $\phi(\int_a^b f(t) d t) = \int_a^b \phi(f(t)) d t$,

(ii) for every continuous seminorm ${\| \cdot \|}$ we have ${\| \int_a^b f(t) d t \|} \leq \int_a^b {\| f(t) \|} d t$

(iii) integration is linear and 

(iv) additive, i.e. $ \int_a^b f(t) d t + \int_b^c f(t) d t = \int_a^c f(t) d t $

=--

There is a version of the fundamental theorem of calculus:


+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Theorem
If P is $C^1$ and $f + t h \in Domain(P)$ for $0 \leq t \leq 1$, then 
$$
P(f + h) - P(f) = \int_0^1 D P(f + t h) \;h \; d t
$$

=--

The chain rule is valid:

+-- {: .un_theorem}
###### Theorem
If P and Q are $C^1$ then so is their composition $Q \circ P$ and
$$
D [Q \circ P](f) h = D Q(P(f)) \; D P(f) \; h
$$
=--

The first derivative $D P$ is a function of two variables, the base point $f$ and the direction $h$. Since $D P$ is already linear in $h$, we define the second derivative with respect to $f$ only:

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition
**second derivative**
The second derivative of $P$ in the direction $k$ is defined to be
$$
D^2 P(f) (h, k) = \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{1}{t} (D P(f + t k) h - D P(f) h)
$$
=--
It is a theorem that the second derivative, if it exists and is jointly continuous, is bilinear in $(h ,k)$.

We can iterate this procedure to define derivatives of arbitrary order, and thus the notion of **smooth functions between Fréchet spaces**.
