## Idea

Fréchet spaces are particularly well-behaved [[topological vector spaces]] (TVSes).  Every [[Cartesian space]] is a Fréchet space, but there are also infinite-dimensional examples.  It is possible to do calculus on Fréchet spaces, yet they are more general than [[Banach spaces]]; as such, they are popular as test spaces for possibly infinite-dimensional [[manifolds]]; see [[Fréchet manifold]].

Note that a 'Fréchet topology' on a 'Fréchet topological space' is different; this just means that a [[topological space]] satisfies the $T_1$ [[separation axiom]].  (Like all Hausdorff TVSes, Fréchet spaces satisfy this axiom, but they have a good deal of additional structure and properties.)


## Definition

A __Fréchet space__ is a [[complete space|complete]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[locally convex space]] that is metrisable by a translation-invariant [[metric space|metric]].

Equivalently, a __Fréchet space__ is a complete Hausdroff TVS whose topology may be given (as a [[gauge space]]) by a [[countable set|countable]] family of [[seminormed vector space|seminorms]].

We accept as an [[automorphism]] of Fréchet spaces any linear [[homeomorphism]]; in particular, the particular translation-invariant metric or countable family of seminorms used to prove that a space is a Fréchet space is *not* required to be preserved.  More generally, the [[morphisms]] of Fréchet spaces are the [[continuous map|continuous]] linear maps, so that Fréchet spaces form a [[full subcategory]] of $TVS$.


## Examples

Every [[Banach space]] is a Fréchet space.

If $X$ is a [[compact space|compact]] [[smooth manifold]], then the space of [[smooth map|smooth maps]] on $X$ is a Fréchet space.  This can be extended to some non-compact manifolds, in particular when $X$ is the [[real line]].

The [[Lebesgue space]] $L^p(\mathbb{R})$ for p &lt; 1 is *not* a Fréchet space, because it is not locally convex.

## Calculus
It is possible to generalize some aspects of calculus to Fréchet spaces, for example the definition of the derivative of a curve is simply the same as in finite dimensions:

###### Definition
For a continuous path in a Fréchet space $f(t)$ we define
$$
f'(t) = lim_{h \to 0} \frac{1}{h} (f(t + h) - f(t))
$$
If the limit exists and is continous, we say that $f$ is continuously differentiably or $C^1$.
