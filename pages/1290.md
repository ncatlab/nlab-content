A [[full subcategory]] $T$ of an [[abelian category]] $A$ is __topologizing__ if

* it is closed with respect to finite [[coproduct]]s (taken in $A$)

* with any object, it contains all its [[subquotient]]s in $A$

A topologizing subcategory is a [[thick subcategory]] if it is also closed under [[extension]]s. 

The classes of topologizing subcategories, [[reflective subcategory|reflective]] topologizing  subcategories and [[coreflective subcategory|coreflective]] topologizing subcategories are closed under [[Gabriel multiplication]] defined on the class of full subcategories of $A$.
