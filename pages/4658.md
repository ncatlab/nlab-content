## Idea

Like a [[Lie groupoid]] is an [[internal groupoid]] in the [[category]] [[Diff]] of [[smooth manifold]]s, a _diffeological groupoid_ is more generally an internal groupoid in the larger category of [[diffeological space]]s.

If we regard Lie groupoids as special cases of [[stack]]s on [[Diff]], then diffeological groupoids are a little more general special cases.


## Examples

* The [[path groupoid]] of a smooth manifold (and indeed of a diffeological space) $X$ is a diffeological groupoid.

* A pointed connected diffeological groupoid is a _diffeological group_, generalizing the notion of [[Lie group]].
