## Idea

_Calabi-Yau cohomology_ is [[complex oriented cohomology theory|complex oriented]] [[generalized cohomology theory]] whose associated [[formal group]] is an [[Artin-Mazur formal group]] $\Phi^n_X$ of a [[Calabi-Yau variety]] $X$ of [[dimension]] $n$. (Which means e.g. [[complex manifold|complex]] dimension if working over the [[complex numbers]]).

As special cases this includes:

* for $n = 0$: [[complex K-theory]];

* for $n = 1$: [[elliptic cohomology]];

* for $n = 2$: [[K3-cohomology]].

## References

The general idea of [[Calabi-Yau cohomology]] apparently appears in 

* {#Hopkins92} [[Michael Hopkins]], lectures at Midwest Topology Seminar, 1992

The suggestion that from the point of view of [[string theory]]/[[F-theory]] K3-cohomology and further Calabi-Yau cohomology this is the required generalization of [[elliptic cohomology]] appears in
