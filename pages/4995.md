## Idea

A _cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos_ is a [[big topos|big]] [[(∞,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$ that provides a context of generalized [[space]]s in which [[higher geometry]] makes sense. 

It is an $(\infty,1)$-topos whose [[global section]] [[(∞,1)-geometric morphism]] $(Disc \dashv \Gamma): \mathbf{H} \stackrel{\overset{Disc}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma}{\to}} $ [[∞Grpd]] admits a further [[left adjoint|left]] [[adjoint (∞,1)-functor]] $\Pi$ and a further right adjoint $coDisc$: 

$$
  (\Pi \dashv Disc \dashv \Gamma \dashv coDisc) : \mathbf{H} \to \infty Grpd
$$ 

with $Disc$ and $coFisc$ both [[full and faithful (∞,1)-functor]]s and such that $\Pi$ moreover preserves finite [[(∞,1)-limit|(∞,1)-product]]s. Here

1. the existence of $coDisc$ induces a sub-[[(∞,1)-quasitopos]] $Conc(\mathbf{H}) \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H}$ of _[[concrete (∞,1)-sheaf|concrete objects]]_ that behave like [[∞-groupoid]]s _equipped with extra cohesive structure_ , such as with [[topology|continuous structure]], [[smooth structure]], etc.

1. the existence of $\Pi$ induces a notion of [[geometric homotopy groups in an (∞,1)-topos|geometric]] [[fundamental ∞-groupoid in a locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos|fundamental ∞-groupoid]], hence under $|-| : \infty Grpd \simeq $ [[Top]] of [[geometric realization]] $|\Pi(-)|$ of objects in $\mathbf{H}$.

The functor $\Gamma$ itself may be thought of as sending a cohesive [[∞-groupoid]] $X$ to its underlying bare $\infty$-groupoid $\Gamma(X)$. This is $X$ with all _cohesion forgotten_ (for instance with the continuous or the smooth structure forgotten).

Conversely, $Disc$ and $CoDisc$ send an $\infty$-groupoid $A$ either to the [[discrete space|discrete ∞-groupoid]] $Disc(A)$ with _discrete_ cohesive structure (for instance with [[discrete topology]]) or to the [[codiscrete space|codiscrete ∞-groupoid]] $Codisc(A)$ with the _codiscrete_ cohesive structure (for instance with [[codiscrete topology]]). 

The existence of such an [[adjoint quadruple]] of adjoint $(\infty,1)$-functors alone implies a rich [[internalization|internal]] [[higher geometry]] in $\mathbf{H}$ that comes with its internal notion of [[Galois theory]], [[Lie theory]], [[differential cohomology]], [[Chern-Weil theory]]. 

Examples of cohesive $(\infty,1)$-toposes include

* the $(\infty,1)$-topos $\mathbf{H} = $[[Disc∞Grpd]] of [[discrete ∞-groupoid]]s; 

* the $(\infty,1)$-topos $\mathbf{H} = $ [[ETop∞Grpd]] of [[Euclidean-topological ∞-groupoids]];

* the $(\infty,1)$-topos $\mathbf{H} = $ [[Smooth∞Grpd]] of [[smooth ∞-groupoids]]; 

* the $(\infty,1)$-topos $\mathbf{H} = $ [[SynthDiff∞Grpd]] of [[synthetic differential ∞-groupoids]];

* the $(\infty,1)$-topos $\mathbf{H} = $ [[Super∞Grpd]] of [[super ∞-groupoids]];

* the $(\infty,1)$-topos $\mathbf{H} = $ [[SmoothSuper∞Grpd]] of [[smooth super ∞-groupoids]].

In [[ETop∞Grpd]] and those contexts containing it, the internal notions of  [[geometric realization]], [[geometric homotopy groups in an (infinity,1)-topos|geometric homotopy]] and [[Galois theory]] subsume the usual ones (over well-behaved topological spaces). In [[Smooth∞Grpd]] also the notions of [[Lie theory]], [[differential cohomology]] and [[Chern-Weil theory]] subsume the usual ones. In [[SynthDiff∞Grpd]] the internal notion of [[Lie algebra]] and [[Lie algebroid]] subsumes the traditional one --- and generalizes them to higher smooth geometry.


## Definition


We state the definition in several equivalent ways.

1. [externally](#ExternalDefinition) in the ambient context;

1. [internally](#InternalDefinition) to the cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos itselfs;

1. internally and [formulated in homotopy type theory](#DefinitionInHomotopyTypeTheory)


### Externally
 {#ExternalDefinition}

The definition is the immediate analog of the definition of a [[cohesive topos]].


+-- {: .num_defn #CohesiveInfinTopos}
###### Definition

An [[(∞,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$ is **cohesive** if

1. it is a [[strongly ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos]];

1. it is a [[local (∞,1)-topos]].


=--

+-- {: .num_remark }
###### Remark


As always in [[topos theory]] and [[higher topos theory]], such definitions can be made sense of over any _base_ . Here: over any [[base (∞,1)-topos]].

Over the canonical base [[∞Grpd]] of [[∞-groupoid]]s, the definition of a cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos is equivalently the following:

the [[global section]] [[(∞,1)-geometric morphism]] $\Gamma : \mathbf{H} \to \infty Grpd$ lifts to an [[adjoint quadruple]] of [[adjoint (∞,1)-functor]]s
   
$$
  (\Pi \dashv Disc \dashv \Gamma \dashv coDisc) : 
  \mathbf{H}
   \stackrel{\stackrel{\overset{\Pi}{\to}}{\overset{Disc}{\leftarrow}}}{\stackrel{\underset{\Gamma}{\to}}{\underset{coDisc}{\leftarrow}}}
  \infty Grpd
  \;
$$

where $\Pi$ preserves [[finite limit|finite]] [[(∞,1)-product]]s.

Often we will tacitly assume to work over [[∞Grpd]]. But most statements and constructions have straightforward generalizations to arbitrary bases.
In particular, below in the [internal definition](#InternalDefinition) of cohesion, it takes more to fix the base topos than to leave it arbitrary.

Every [[adjoint quadruple]] induces an [[adjoint triple]] of endofunctors. 

$$
  (
   \mathbf{\Pi}
   \dashv 
   \mathbf{\flat}
   \dashv 
   \mathbf{#}
  )
  :
  \mathbf{H}
    \stackrel{\overset{\Pi}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{\Disc}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma}{\to}}}
  \infty Grpd
   \stackrel{\overset{Disc}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{\Gamma}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{coDisc}{\to}}}
  \mathbf{H}
  \,.
$$

Here "$\mathbf{\flat}$" is meant to be pronounced "flat". The interpretation of these three functors is discussed in detail at _[[cohesive (∞,1)-topos -- structures]]_.

=--



Sometimes it is desireable to add further axioms, such as the following.

+-- {: .num_defn #PiecesHavePoints}
###### Definition

We say that **pieces have points** for an object
$X$ in a cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos $\mathbf{H}$ 
if the morphism

$$
  \Gamma X \to \Gamma Disc \Pi X \simeq \Pi X
$$ 

is an [[effective epimorphism in an (∞,1)-category]], equivalently (as discussed there) such that this is an [[epimorphism]] on [[connected]] components.


=--

Here the first morphismism is the image under $\Gamma$ of the 
$(Disc \dashv \Gamma)$-[[unit of an adjunction|unit]] and the second is an inverse of the $(\Pi \dashv Disc)$-counit (which is invertible because $Disc$ is [[full and faithful (∞,1)-functor|full and faithful]] in a [[local (∞,1)-topos]].)

+-- {: .num_defn #DiscreteObjectsAreConcrete}
###### Definition

We say **discrete objects are concrete** in $\mathbf{H}$ if for all
$S \in $[[∞Grpd]] the morphism

$$
  Disc S \to coDisc \Gamma Disc S \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} coDisc S
$$

induces [[monomorphism]]s on all [[categorical homotopy groups in an (infinity,1)-topos|homotopy sheaves]].

=--


### Internally
 {#InternalDefinition}

We reformulate the [above axioms](#ExternalDefinition) for a cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos without references to functors _on_ it, and instead entirely in terms of structures _in_ it.

+-- {: .num_lemma #ReflectiveEmbeddingInternally}
###### Lemma

A [[full sub-(∞,1)-category]] $\mathbf{B} \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H}$ is

* [[reflective sub-(∞,1)-category|reflectively embedded]] precisely if for every [[object]] $X \in \mathbf{H}$ there is a [[morphism]] 

  $$
    loc_X : X \to L X
  $$ 

  (the [[unit of an adjunction|unit]]) with $L X \in \mathbf{B} \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H}$, such that for all $Y \in \mathbf{B} \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H}$ the value of the [[(∞,1)-categorical hom-space]]-functor 

  $$
    \mathbf{H}(loc_X, Y) : 
    \mathbf{H}(L X, Y)
    \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
    \mathbf{H}(X, Y)
  $$

  is an [[equivalence in an (∞,1)-category|equivalence]] (of [[∞-groupoid]]s). 

* coreflectively embedded precisely if for every [[object]] $Y \in \mathbf{H}$ there is a [[morphism]] 

  $$
    coloc_Y : R Y \to Y
  $$ 

  (the [[unit of an adjunction|counit]]) with $R Y \in \mathbf{B} \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H}$ such that for all $X \in \mathbf{B} \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H}$ the value of the [[(∞,1)-categorical hom-space]]-functor 

  $$
    \mathbf{H}(X, coloc_Y) : 
    \mathbf{H}(X, R Y)
    \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
    \mathbf{H}(X, Y)
  $$

  is an [[equivalence in an (∞,1)-category|equivalence]] (of [[∞-groupoid]]s). 


=--

This is proven [here](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/reflective+sub-%28infinity,1%29-category#CharacterizationOfReflectors).

+-- {: .num_lemma}
###### Lemma

A reflective embedding 

$$
  coDisc : \mathbf{B}_{cod} \stackrel{\overset{\tilde \Gamma}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{coDisc}{\hookrightarrow}} \mathbf{H}
$$

and a coreflective embedding 

$$
  Disc : \mathbf{B}_{disc} \stackrel{\overset{Disc}{\hookrightarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma}{\leftarrow}} \mathbf{H}
$$

fit into a single [[adjoint triple]]

$$
  \mathbf{H}
    \stackrel{
      \overset{Disc}{\hookleftarrow}
    }{
     \stackrel{  
       \overset{\Gamma}{\to}
     }{
       \underset{coDisc}{\hookleftarrow}
     }
   }
  \mathbf{B}
$$

(hence there is an equivalence $\mathbf{B}_{disc} \simeq \mathbf{B}_{cod}$ that moreover makes the coreflector $\tilde\Gamma$ of $Disc$ coincide with the reflector $\Gamma$ of $coDisc$) precisely if for the [[unit of an adjunction|unit]] and counit given by  lemma \ref{ReflectiveEmbeddingInternally} we have that the morphisms on the left of

\[
  \label{FirstNaturalEquivalence}
  coDisc \tilde \Gamma (Disc \Gamma X \to X)
  \;
  =:
  \;
  (coDisc \tilde \Gamma Disc \Gamma X
   \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  coDisc \tilde \Gamma X)
\]

\[ 
  \label{SecondNaturalEquivalence}
  Disc \Gamma (X \to coDisc \tilde \Gamma X)
  \;\;
   =:
  \;\;
  (
    Disc \Gamma X 
     \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
    Disc \Gamma coDisc \tilde \Gamma
  )
\]

are (natural) [[equivalence in an (∞,1)-category|equivalences]] for all objects $X \in \mathbf{H}$, as indicated on the right.

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

It is clear that if we have an [[adjoint triple]], then (eq:FirstNaturalEquivalence) and (eq:SecondNaturalEquivalence) are implied. We discuss now the converse.

First notice that the two embeddings always combine into an adjunction of the form

$$
  \mathbf{B}_{disc}
   \stackrel{\overset{Disc}{\hookrightarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma}{\leftarrow}}
  \mathbf{H}
   \stackrel{\overset{\tilde \Gamma}{\to}}{\underset{coDisc}{\hookleftarrow}}
  \mathbf{B}_{cod}    
  \,.
$$

The natural equivalence (eq:FirstNaturalEquivalence) applied to a codiscrete object $X := coDisc A$ gives that $coDisc$ of the counit of this composite adjunction is an equivalence 

$$
  coDisc \tilde \Gamma Disc \Gamma coDisc A
    \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  coDisc \tilde \Gamma coDisc A
    \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  coDisc A
$$

for all $A$, and since $coDisc$ is [[full and faithful (infinity,1)-functor|full and faithful]], so is the composite counit 

$$
  \tilde \Gamma Disc \Gamma coDisc A
    \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  \tilde \Gamma coDisc A
    \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  A  
$$

itself. Analogously, (eq:SecondNaturalEquivalence) implies that the unit of the composite adjunction is an equivalence. Therefore (eq:FirstNaturalEquivalence) and (eq:SecondNaturalEquivalence) together imply that the adjunction itself exhibits an [[equivalence of (∞,1)-categories|equivalence]] $\mathbf{B}_{disc} \simeq \mathbf{B}_{cod}$.

Using this we then find for each $X \in \mathbf{H}$ a composite natural equivalence

$$
  Disc \tilde \Gamma X
   \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  Disc \Gamma coDisc \tilde \Gamma X
   \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  Disc \Gamma X
$$

where the first morphism uses the above equivalence on the codiscrete object $\tilde \Gamma X$ and the second is a choice of natural inverse of (eq:SecondNaturalEquivalence).

Since $Disc$ is full and faithful, this mean that we have equivalences

$$
  \tilde \Gamma X 
   \simeq 
  \Gamma X
$$

natural in $X$, hence that $\tilde \Gamma \simeq \Gamma$.

=--

Using these lemmas we can now restate cohesiveness internally.

+-- {: .num_corollary}
###### Corollary

For $Disc : \mathbf{B} \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H}$ a [[sub-(∞,1)-category]], 
the inclusion extends to an [[adjoint quadruple]] of the form

$$
  \mathbf{H}
    \stackrel{\overset{\Pi}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{Disc}{\hookleftarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{\Gamma}{\to}}{\underset{coDisc}{\hookleftarrow}}}}
  \mathbf{B}
$$

precisely if there exists for each object $X \in \mathbf{H}$

1. a morphism $X \to \mathbf{\Pi}(X)$ with $\mathbf{\Pi}(X) \in \mathbf{B} \stackrel{Disc}{\hookrightarrow} \mathbf{H}$;

1. a morphism $\mathbf{\flat} X \to X$ with $\mathbf{\flat} X \in \mathbf{B} \stackrel{Disc}{\hookrightarrow} \mathbf{H}$;

1. a morphism $X \to #X $ with $# X \in \mathbf{B} \stackrel{coDisc}{\hookrightarrow} \mathbf{H}$

such that for all $Y \in \mathbf{B} \stackrel{Disc}{\hookrightarrow} \mathbf{H}$ and $\tilde Y \in \mathbf{B} \stackrel{coDisc}{\hookrightarrow} \mathbf{H}$ the induced morphisms

1. $\mathbf{H}(\mathbf{\Pi}X , Y) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} \mathbf{H}(X,Y)$;

1. $\mathbf{H}(Y, \mathbf{\flat}X) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} \mathbf{H}(Y,X)$;

1. $\mathbf{H}(# X , \tilde Y) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} \mathbf{H}(X,\tilde Y)$;


are [[equivalence in an (infinity,1)-category|equivalences]] (of [[∞-groupoids]]).

Moreover, if $\mathbf{H}, \mathbf{B}$ both have a [[terminal object in an (∞,1)-category|terminal object]], then $\Pi$ preserves this precisely if the given morphism $* \to \mathbf{\Pi}(*)$ is an equivalence.

=--


### Formulation in homotopy type theory
  {#DefinitionInHomotopyTypeTheory}

We state the above [internal definition](#InternalDefinition) of a cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos in the formal language of [[homotopy type theory]]. For [[Coq]]-implementations see the [references below](#ReferencesInHoTT).

    Require Import Homotopy Utf8.

There is a full subcategory of objects called _discrete_ .

    Axiom is_discrete : Type → Type.

    Axiom is_discrete_is_prop : ∀ X, is_prop (is_discrete X).

Every object has a reflection into a discrete object.

    Axiom pi : Type → Type.

    Axiom pi_is_discrete : ∀ X, is_discrete (pi X).

    Axiom map_to_pi : ∀ X, X → pi X.

    Axiom pi_is_reflection : ∀ X Y, is_discrete Y → is_equiv (fun f: pi X → Y => f ○ (map_to_pi X)).

The reflector preserves the terminal object.

    Axiom pi_preserve_terminal : is_equiv (map_to_pi unit).

Every object has a coreflection from a discrete object.
 
    Axiom flat : Type → Type.

    Axiom flat_is_discrete : ∀ X, is_discrete (flat X).

    Axiom map_from_flat : ∀ X, flat X → X.

    Axiom flat_is_coreflection : ∀ X Y, is_discrete Y → is_equiv (fun f : Y → flat X => (map_from_flat X) ○ f).

There is a full subcategory of objects called _codiscrete_ . 

    Axiom is_codiscrete : Type → Type.

    Axiom is_codiscrete_is_prop : ∀ X, is_prop (is_codiscrete X).

Every object has a reflection into a codiscrete object.

    Axiom sharp : Type → Type.

    Axiom sharp_is_codiscrete : ∀ X, is_codiscrete (sharp X).

    Axiom map_to_sharp : ∀ X, X → sharp X.

    Axiom sharp_is_reflection : ∀ X Y, is_codiscrete Y → is_equiv (fun f: sharp X → Y => f ○ (map_to_sharp X)).

Finally, the categories of discrete and codiscrete objects are equivalent via the adjunction $\flat \dashv #$, and when they are identified along this equivalence, the coreflector into discrete objects coincides with the reflector into codiscrete objects (both being $\Gamma$).

    Axiom codiscrete_respects_discrete : ∀ X, is_equiv ( functor_map sharp ( map_from_flat X ) )

    Axiom discrete_respects_codiscrete : ∀ X, is_equiv ( functor_map flat ( map_to_sharp X ) ) 


## Properties

We discuss basic properties implied by the axioms for cohesive $(\infty,1)$-toposes in 

* [As a point-like space](#AsAPointLikeSpace);

* [General](#General).

Then we discuss presentations over special [[site]]s in  

* [Over an ∞-cohesive site](#OverAnInfinityCohesiveSite).

### As a point-like space
 {#AsAPointLikeSpace}



+-- {: .num_prop #PointLike}
###### Proposition

A nontrivial cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos

1. has the [[shape of an (∞,1)-topos|shape]] of the point;

1. has [[homotopy dimension]] 0;

1. has [[cohomology dimension]] 0.
 

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The first holds for every [[∞-connected (∞,1)-topos]], see there.

The second holds for every [[local (∞,1)-topos]], see there.

The third follows from the second, see [[homotopy dimension]].

=--

+-- {: .num_remark #ThickenedPoint}
###### Remark

This says that a cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos $\mathbf{H}$ is, when itself regarded as a [[little topos]], a generalized [[space]], a _thickened point_ . We may think of it as the standard [[point]] equipped with a _cohesive neighbourhood_ .

In this sense every space $X$ _modeled on_ the cohesive structure defined by $\mathbf{H}$ is an [[étale space]] over $X$: its [[petit topos|petit]] $(\infty,1)$-topos $\mathbf{H}/X$ sits by a [[locally homeomorphic geometric morphism]] over $\mathbf{H}$

$$
  \mathbf{H}/X \stackrel{local\;homeo}{\to} \mathbf{H}

For $C$ an [[∞-cohesive site] the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves]] $(\infty,1)Sh(C)$ over $C$ is a cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos satisfying the two axioms _[pieces have points](#PiecesHavePoints)_ and _[discrete objects are concrete](#DiscreteObjectsAreConcrete)_ .

## Structures in a cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos 
  {#Structures}

A cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos is a general context for [[higher geometry]] with good [[cohomology]] and [[homotopy]] properties. We list fundamental structures and constructions that exist in every cohesvive $(\infty,1)$-topos.

This section is at 

* [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos -- structures]]


##  Infinitesimal cohesion   
  {#InfinitesimalCohesion}

We discuss [[extra structure]] on a cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos
that encodes a refinement of the corresponding notion of cohesion to 
_infinitesimal cohesion_ . More precisely, we consider inclusions
$\mathbf{H} \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H}_{th}$ of cohesive 
$(\infty,1)$-toposes that exhibit the objects of $\mathbf{H}_{th}$
as infinitesimal cohesive neighbourhoods of objects in 
$\mathbf{H}$.

This section is at

* [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos -- infinitesimal cohesion]]

## Locally ringed cohesion

Every cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos $\mathbf{H}$ equipped with 
[infinitesimal cohesion](#InfinitesimalCohesion) comes canonically equipped with a notion of [[formally étale morphism]]s (as discussed there). Combined with the canonical interpretation of $\mathbf{H}$ as the [[classifying topos]] of a [[theory]] of [[local algebra|local T-algebra]]s, this caninically induces a notion of [[locally algebra-ed topos|locally algebra-ed (∞,1)-toposes]] with cohesive structure, generalizing the notion of [[locally ringed space]]s and [[locally ringed topos]]es.

This section is at 

* [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos -- structure ∞-sheaves]].


## Examples {#Examples}

###### Proposition

Examples of [[∞-cohesive site]]s are

* any category with finite [[product]]s and equipped with the trivial [[coverage]].

* the [[full subcategory]] $CartSp_{top} \subset$ [[Top]] on [[open ball]]s with the [[good open cover]] [[coverage]];

* the site [[CartSp]] of [[Cartesian space]]s with [[smooth function]]s between them and [[good open cover]] [[coverage]].

* the [[Cahiers topos]]-site [[ThCartSp]] of infinitesimally thickened Cartesian spaces.

### Precursors

The [[category theory|category-theoretic]] definition of [[cohesive topos]] was proposed by [[Bill Lawvere]]. See the references at _[[cohesive topos]]_.

The observation that the further left adjoint $\Pi$ in a [[locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos]] defines an intrinsic notion of paths and [[geometric homotopy groups in an (∞,1)-topos]] was suggested by [[Richard Williamson]].

The observation that the further right adjoint $coDisc$ in a [[local (∞,1)-topos]] serves to characterize [[concrete sheaf|concrete (∞,1)-sheaves]] was amplified by [[David Carchedi]].

The notion of geometric realization (see <a href="http://nlab.mathforge.org/nlab/show/cohesive+%28infinity%2C1%29-topos%20--%20structures#Homotopy">structures in a cohesive (∞,1)-topos -- geometric realization</a>), is touched on around remark 2.22, referring to

* [[Carlos Simpson]], _The topological realization of a simplicial presheaf_ , ([arXiv:q-alg/9609004](http://arxiv.org/abs/q-alg/9609004)).

But, more or less explicitly, the presentation of geometric realization of simplicial presheaves is much older, going back to Artin-Mazur. See [[geometric homotopy groups in an (∞,1)-topos]] for a detailed commented list of literature.

A characterization of infinitesimal extensions and formal smoothness by adjoint functors (discussed at [[infinitesimal cohesion]]) is considered in

in the context of _[[Q-categories]]_ .

### On cohesive $(\infty,1)$-toposes proper

The material presented here is also in section 2 of
