## Idea

A _cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos_ is a [[big topos|big]] [[(∞,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$ that provides a context of generalized [[space]]s in which [[higher geometry]] makes sense. 

It is an $(\infty,1)$-topos whose [[global section]] [[(∞,1)-geometric morphism]] $(Disc \dashv \Gamma): \mathbf{H} \stackrel{\overset{Disc}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma}{\to}} $ [[∞Grpd]] admits a further [[left adjoint|left]] [[adjoint (∞,1)-functor]] $\Pi$ and a further right adjoint $CoDisc$: 

$$
  (\Pi \dashv Disc \dashv \Gamma \dashv Codisc) : \mathbf{H} \to \infty Grpd
$$ 

with $Disc$ and $Codisc$ both [[full and faithful (∞,1)-functor]]s and such that $\Pi$ moreover preserves finite [[(∞,1)-limit|(∞,1)-product]]s. Here

1. the existence of $CoDisc$ induces a sub-[[(∞,1)-quasitopos]] $Conc(\mathbf{H}) \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H}$ of _[[concrete (∞,1)-sheaf|concrete objects]]_ that behave like [[∞-groupoid]]s _equipped with extra cohesive structure_ , such as with [[topology|continuous structure]], [[smooth structure]], etc.

1. the existence of $\Pi$ induces a notion of [[geometric homotopy groups in an (∞,1)-topos|geometric]] [[fundamental ∞-groupoid in a locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos|fundamental ∞-groupoid]], hence under $|-| : \infty Grpd \simeq $ [[Top]] of [[geometric realization]] $|\Pi(-)|$ of objects in $\mathbf{H}$.

The functor $\Gamma$ itself may be thought of as sending a cohesive [[∞-groupoid]] $X$ to its underlying bare $\infty$-groupoid $\Gamma(X)$. This is $X$ with all _cohesion forgotten_ (for instance with the continuous or the smooth structure forgotten).

Conversely, $Disc$ and $CoDisc$ send an $\infty$-groupoid $A$ either to the [[discrete space|discrete ∞-groupoid]] $Disc(A)$ with _discrete_ cohesive structure (for instance with [[discrete topology]]) or to the [[codiscrete space|codiscrete ∞-groupoid]] $Codisc(A)$ with the _codiscrete_ cohesive structure (for instance with [[codiscrete topology]]). 

The existence of such an [[adjoint quadruple]] of adjoint $(\infty,1)$-functors alone implies a rich [[internalization|internal]] [[higher geometry]] in $\mathbf{H}$ that comes with its internal notion of [[Galois theory]], [[Lie theory]], [[differential cohomology]], [[Chern-Weil theory]]. 

Examples of cohesive $(\infty,1)$-toposes include

* the $(\infty,1)$-topos $\mathbf{H} = $ [[ETop∞Grpd]] of [[Euclidean-topological ∞-groupoids]];

* the $(\infty,1)$-topos $\mathbf{H} = $ [[Smooth∞Grpd]] of [[smooth ∞-groupoids]] 

* the $(\infty,1)$-topos $\mathbf{H} = $ [[SynthDiff∞Grpd]] of [[synthetic differential ∞-groupoids]].

In the first the internal notion of [[Galois theory]] subsumes the usual one (over well-behaved topological spaces). In the latter also the notions of [[Lie theory]], [[differential cohomology]] and [[Chern-Weil theory]] subsume the uual ones --- and generalize them to higher smooth geoemtry.


## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn #CohesiveInfinTopos}
###### Definition

An [[(∞,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}$ is **cohesive** if

1. it is a [[strongly ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos]];

1. it is a [[local (∞,1)-topos]].

This means equivalently: the [[global section]] [[(∞,1)-geometric morphism]] lifts to an [[adjoint quadruple]] of [[adjoint (∞,1)-functor]]s
   
$$
  (f_! \dashv f^* \dashv f_* \dashv f^!) : 
  \mathbf{H}
   \stackrel{\stackrel{\overset{f_!}{\to}}{\overset{f^*}{\leftarrow}}}{\stackrel{\underset{f_*}{\to}}{\underset{f^!}{\leftarrow}}}
  \infty Grpd
  \;
$$

where $f_!$ preserves [[finite limit|finite]] [[(∞,1)-product]]s.

=--

+-- {: .num_defn #PiecesHavePoints}
###### Definition

We say that **pieces have points** for an object
$X$ in a cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos $\mathbf{H}$ 
if the morphism

$$
  \Gamma X \to \Gamma Disc \Pi X \simeq \Pi X
$$ 

is an [[effective epimorphism in an (∞,1)-category]], equivalently (as discussed there) such that this is an [[epimorphism]] on [[connected]] components.


=--

Here the first morphismism is the image under $\Gamma$ of the 
$(Disc \dashv \Gamma)$-[[unit of an adjunction|unit]] and the second is an inverse of the $(\Pi \dashv Disc)$-counit (which is invertible because $Disc$ is [[full and faithful (∞,1)-functor|full and faithful]] in a [[local (∞,1)-topos]].)

+-- {: .num_defn #DiscreteObjectsAreConcrete}
###### Definition

We say **discrete objects are concrete** in $\mathbf{H}$ if for all
$S \in $[[∞Grpd]] the morphism

$$
  Disc S \to coDisc \Gamma Disc S \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} coDisc S
$$

induces [[monomorphism]]s on all [[categorical homotopy groups in an (infinity,1)-topos|homotopy sheaves]].

## Properties


### As a point-like space



+-- {: .num_prop #PointLike}
###### Proposition

A nontrivial cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos

1. has the [[shape of an (∞,1)-topos|shape]] of the point;

1. has [[homotopy dimension]] 0;

1. has [[cohomology dimension]] 0.
 

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

The first holds for every [[∞-connected (∞,1)-topos]], see there.

The second holds for every [[local (∞,1)-topos]], see there.

The third follows from the second, see [[homotopy dimension]].

=--

+-- {: .num_remark #ThickenedPoint}
###### Remark

This says that a cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos $\mathbf{H}$ is, when itself regarded as a [[little topos]], a generalized [[space]], a _thickened point_ . We may think of it as the standard [[point]] equipped with a _cohesive neighbourhood_ .

In this sense every space $X$ _modeled on_ the cohesive structure defined by $\mathbf{H}$ is an [[étale space]] over $X$: its [[petit topos|petit]] $(\infty,1)$-topos $\mathbf{H}/X$ sits by a [[locally homeomorphic geometric morphism]] over $\mathbf{H}$

$$
  \mathbf{H}/X \stackrel{local\;homeo}{\to} \mathbf{H}
  \,.
$$

### General

+-- {: .num_prop #HypercompleteProperty}
###### Proposition

Every cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos is a 
[[hypercomplete (∞,1)-topos]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof


By the [above proposition](#PointLike) it has finite 
[[homotopy dimension]]. This implies hypercompeteness. See there.

=--

+-- {: .num_prop #Cohesive1Topos}
###### Proposition

For $\mathbf{H}$ a cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos, the [[(n,1)-topos|(1,1)-topos]] $\tau_{\leq 1-1} \mathbf{H}$ of 0-[[truncated]] objects is a [[cohesive topos]].

=--


### Over an $\infty$-cohesive site

We discuss a [[presentable (∞,1)-category|presentation]] of classes of cohesive [[(∞,1)-topos]]es by a [[model structure on simplicial presheaves]] over a suitable [[site]].


+-- {: .num_prop #SimplicialPresheavesOverInfinityCohesviveSite}
###### Proposition

For $C$ an [[∞-cohesive site] the [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves]] $(\infty,1)Sh(C)$ over $C$ is a cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos satisfying the two axioms _[pieces have points](#PiecesHavePoints)_ and _[discrete objects are concrete](#DiscreteObjectsAreConcrete)_ .

## Structures in a cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos {#Structures}

A cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos is a general context for [[higher geometry]] with good [[cohomology]] and [[homotopy]] properties. We list fundamental structures and constructions that exist in every cohesvive $(\infty,1)$-topos.

This section is at 

* [[cohesive (∞,1)-topos -- structures]]


##  Infinitesimal cohesion   
  {#InfinitesimalCohesion}

We discuss [[extra structure]] on a cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos
that encodes a refinement of the corresponding notion of cohesion to 
_infinitesimal cohesion_ . More precisely, we consider inclusions
$\mathbf{H} \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H}_{th}$ of cohesive 
$(\infty,1)$-toposes that exhibit the objects of $\mathbf{H}_{th}$
as infinitesimal cohesive neighbourhoods of objects in 
$\mathbf{H}$.

* the [[Cahiers topos]]-site [[ThCartSp]] of infinitesimally thickened Cartesian spaces.

## References

The [[category theory|category-theoretic]] definition of [[cohesive topos]] was proposed by [[Bill Lawvere]]. See the references at [[cohesive topos]].

The observation that the further left adjoint $\Pi$ in a [[locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos]] defines an intrinsic notion of paths and [[geometric homotopy groups in an (∞,1)-topos]] was suggested by [[Richard Williamson]].

The observation that the further right adjoint $coDisc$ in a [[local (∞,1)-topos]] serves to characterize [[concrete sheaf|concrete (∞,1)-sheaves]] was amplified by [[David Carchedi]].

Several aspects of the discussion here are, more or less explicitly, in 

* [[Carlos Simpson]], [[Constantin Teleman]], _deRham theorem for $\infty$-stacks_ ([pdf](http://math.berkeley.edu/~teleman/math/simpson.pdf))

For instance something similar to the notion of [[infinity-connected (infinity,1)-site|∞-connected site]] and the 
[[fundamental ∞-groupoid in a locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos]] is the content of section 2.16.  The [infinitesimal path ∞-groupoid adjunction](#LieTheory) $(\mathbf{Red} \dashv \mathbf{\Pi}_{inf} \dashv \mathbf{\flat}_{inf})$ is essentially discussed in section 3. The notion of geometric realization, \ref{GeometricRealization}, is touched on around remark 2.22, referring to

* [[Carlos Simpson]], _The topological realization of a simplicial presheaf_ , [arXiv:q-alg/9609004](http://arxiv.org/abs/q-alg/9609004).

But, more or less explicitly, the presentation of geometric realization of simplicial presheaves is much older, going back to Artin-Mazur. See [[geometric homotopy groups in an (∞,1)-topos]] for a detailed commented list of literature.
