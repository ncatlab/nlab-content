A **monomial matrix** with entries in a [[field]] $F$ is an $n \times n$ [[matrix]] with exactly one nonzero entry in each row and exactly one nonzero entry in each column. Under matrix multiplication, monomial matrices form a [[group]]; this group is isomorphic to a [[semidirect product group|wreath product]] 

$$S_n \ltimes (F^\ast)^n$$ 

with respect to the canonical action of the [[permutation group]] $S_n$ on the $n^{th}$ power $(F^\ast)^n$ of the group of nonzero scalars. 

The special case where the non-vanishing entries are 1 is _[[permutation matrices]]_
