

A _cyclic ring_ is a [[cyclic group]] $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{Z}$, equipped with its canonical [[commutative ring]]-structure induced from multiplication in the [[integers]].

(hm, bad terminology, need disambiguation with the other meaning of cyclic ring)

For $n$ a [[prime number]] this is a _[[prime field]]_.
