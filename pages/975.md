**Summary**

The book discusses the theory of [[presheaf|presheaves]] and [[sheaf|sheaves]] with an eye towards their application in [[homological algebra]] and with an outlook on [[stack]]s.

A self-contained introduction of the basics of [[presheaf]]-categories with detailed discussion of [[representable functor]]s and the corresponding notions of [[limit]]s, [[colimit]]s, [[adjoint functor]]s and [[ind-object]]s forms the first third of the book.

The second part describes central concepts and tools of modern category-theoretic [[homological algebra]] in terms of [[derived category|derived]] [[triangulated category|triangulated categories]].

The last part merges these two threads in a discussion of [[sheaf|sheaves]] in general and [[abelian sheaf|abelian sheaves]] in particular. This provides the machinery for the consideration of [[abelian sheaf cohomology]] conceptually embedded into the general notion of [[cohomology]] and [[(infinity,1)-category of (infinity,1)-sheaves|higher stacks]], on which the last section provides an outlook.

The organization and emphasis of the book (for instance of the [[category of sheaves]] as a [[localization]] of the category of [[presheaf|presheaves]]) makes it a suitable 1-categorical preparation for the [[infinity-category|infinity-categorical]] discussion of sheaves in

* J. Lurie, _[[Higher Topos Theory]]_

and of triangulated categories, i.e. [[stable (infinity,1)-category|stable infinity-categories]], in 

* J. Lurie, _[[Stable Infinity-Categories]]_

On the other hand, [[topos]]-theoretic aspects of the [[category of sheaves]] are not emphasized, here 

* Moerdijk-MacLane, _[[Sheaves in Geometry and Logic]]_

is the natural complementary reading. In particular sections V and VII there are directly useful for supplementing the concept of [[geometric morphism]] and its relation to [[localization]].
