## Idea

A **[[Grothendieck]] fibration fibered in groupoids** -- usually called a **category fibered in groupoids** -- is a [[Grothendieck fibration]] $p : E \to B$ all whose [[fiber]]s are [[groupoid]]s.

## Definition

A **fibration fibered in groupoids** is a [[functor]] $p : E \to B$ such that the corresponding (strict) functor $B^{op} \to $ [[Cat]] that classifying $p$ under the [[Grothendieck construction]] factors through the inclusion [[Grpd]] $\hookrightarrow$ [[Cat]].

Under forming [[opposite categories]] we obtain the notion of an **op-fibration fibered in groupoids**. In old literature this is sometimes called a "cofibration in groupoids" but that terminology collides badly with the notion of cofibration in [[homotopy theory]] and [[model category]] theory.

## Properties

Fibrations in groupoids have a simple characterization in terms of their [[nerve]]s. Let $N : Cat \to sSet$ be the [[nerve]] functor and for $p : E \to B$ a morphism in [[Cat]], let $N(p) : N(E) \to N(B)$ be the corresponding morphism in [[sSet]].

###### Proposition

The functor $p : E \to B$ is an  op-fibration in groupoids precisely if the morphism $N(p) : N(E) \to N(B)$ is a [[left Kan fibration]] of simplicial sets, i.e. precisely if for all [[horn]] inclusion 

$$
  \Lambda[n]_i \hookrightarrow \Delta[n]
$$

for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and all $i$ _smaller_ than $n$ -- $0 \leq i \lt n$, we have that every commuting diagram

$$
  \array{
    \Lambda[n]_i &\to& N(E)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{N(p)}}
    \\
    \Delta[n] &\to& N(B)
  }
$$

has a lift

$$
  \array{
    \Lambda[n]_i &\to& N(E)
    \\
    \downarrow &\nearrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{N(p)}}
    \\
    \Delta[n] &\to& N(B)
  }
  \,.
$$
