##Idea

Given a [[group]] $G$ and two [[subgroups]] $H$ and $K$, then the set of **double cosets**, $H \backslash G/K$, is composed of [[equivalence classes]] of elements of $G$ where two elements are regarded as equivalent if they differ by left multiplication with an element in $H$ and right multiplication with an element of $K$.

This construction generalises to [[topological groups]] and [[Lie groups]], where it is called a **double coset space**.
