## Idea ##

_$L_\infty$-algebras_ (or _strong homotopy Lie algebras_) are a higher generalization (a "[[vertical categorification]]") of [[Lie algebras]]: in an $L_\infty$-algebra the [[Jacobi identity]] is allowed to hold (only) up to higher [[coherence law|coherent]] [[homotopy]]. 

An $L_\infty$-algebra that is concentrated in lowest degree is an ordinary [[Lie algebra]]. If it is concentrated in the lowest two degrees is is a [[Lie 2-algebra]], etc.

From another perspective: an $L_\infty$-algebra is a [[Lie ∞-algebroid]] with a single object.

$L_\infty$-algebras are [[infinitesimal space|infinitesimal]] approximations of [[smooth ∞-group]]s in analogy to how an ordinary Lie algebra is an infinitesimal approximation of a [[Lie group]]. Under [[Lie integration]] every $L_\infty$-algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ "exponentiates" to a [[smooth ∞-group]] $\Omega \exp(\mathfrak{g})$.

## Definition ##

### Abstract definition in terms of algebras over an operad

An **$L_\infty$-algebra** is an [[algebra over an operad]] in the [[category of chain complexes]] over the [[L-∞ operad]].

In the following we spell out in detail what this means in components.

### Definition in terms of higher brackets 
 {#DefinitionViaHigherBrackets}

For $V$ a [[graded vector space]], for $v_i \in V_{\vert v_i\vert}$ homogenously graded elements, and for $\sigma$ a [[permutation]] of $n$ elements, write
$\chi(\sigma, v_1, \cdots, v_n)\in \{-1,+1\}$ for the product of the [[signature of a permutation|signature of the permutation]] with a factor of $(-1)^{\vert v_i \vert \vert v_j \vert}$ for each interchange of neighbours $(\cdots v_i,v_j, \cdots )$ to $(\cdots v_j,v_i, \cdots )$ involved in the permutation.


+-- {: .num_defn #LInfinityDefinitionViaGeneralizedJacobiIdentity}
###### Definition

An $L_\infty$-algebra is 

1. a [[graded vector space]] $V$;

1. for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ a [[multilinear map]] called the _$n$-ary bracket_

   $l_n(\cdots) \coloneqq [-,-, \cdots, -] \colon V^{\wedge n} \to V$
  
   of degree $n-2$
  
such that 

1. each $l_n$ is graded antisymmetric, in that for every [[permutation]] $\sigma$ and homogeneously graded elements $v_i \in V_{\vert v_i \vert}$ then

   $$
     l_n(v_{\sigma(1)}, v_{\sigma(2)},\cdots ,v_{\sigma(n)}) 
     = 
     \chi(\sigma,v_1,\cdots, v_n) \cdot l_n(v_1, v_2, \cdots v_n)
   $$

1. the _generalized [[Jacobi identity]]_ holds:

   \[
     \label{LInfinityJacobiIdentity}
     \sum_{i+j = n+1} 
     \sum_{\sigma \in UnShuff(i,n-i)}
     \chi(\sigma,v_1, \cdots, v_m)
     (-1)^{i(j-1)}
      l_{j} \left(
        l_i \left( v_{\sigma(1)}, \cdots, v_{\sigma(i)} \right),
        v_{\sigma(i+1)} , \cdots , v_{\sigma(n)}
      \right)
     = 0
     \,,
   \]

   for all $n$, all and homogeneously graded elements $v_i \in V_i$ (here the inner sum runs over all $(i,j)$-[[unshuffles]] $\sigma$).

=--

There are various different conventions on the gradings possible, which lead to similar formulas with different signs.


+-- {: .num_example }
###### Example

In lowest degrees the generalized Jacobi identity says that

1. for $n = 1$: the unary map $\partial \coloneqq l_1$ squares to 0:

   $$
     \partial (\partial(v_1)) = 0
   $$

1: for $n = 2$: the unary map $\partial$ is a graded [[derivation]] of the binary map

   $$
     - [\partial v_1, v_2] 
     - (-1)^{\vert v_1 \vert \vert v_2 \vert}
     [\partial v_2, v_1]
     +
     \partial [v_1, v_2]
     =
     0
   $$

   hence
 
   $$
     \partial [v_1, v_2] =  [\partial v_1, v_2] + (-1)^{\vert v_1 \vert}[v_1, \partial v_2]
     \,.
   $$

=--

+-- {: .num_example }
###### Example

When all higher brackets vanish, $l_{k \gt 2}= 0$ then for $n = 3$: 

$$
  [[v_1,v_2],v_3] 
  +
  (-1)^{\vert v_1 \vert (\vert v_2 \vert + \vert v_3 \vert)}
  [[v_2,v_3],v_1]
  +
  (-1)^{\vert v_2 \vert (\vert v_1 \vert + \vert v_3 \vert)}
  [[v_1,v_3],v_2]
  =
  0
$$

this is the graded [[Jacobi identity]]. So in this case the $L_\infty$-algebra
is equivalently a [[dg-Lie algebra]].

=--

+-- {: .num_example }
###### Example

When $l_3$ is possibly non-vanishing, then on elements $x_i$ on which $\partial = l_1$ vanishes then the generalized Jacobi identity for $n = 3$ gives

$$
  [[v_1,v_2],v_3] 
  +
  (-1)^{\vert v_1 \vert (\vert v_2 \vert + \vert v_3 \vert)}
  [[v_2,v_3],v_1]
  +
  (-1)^{\vert v_2 \vert (\vert v_1 \vert + \vert v_3 \vert)}
  [[v_1,v_3],v_2]
  =
  - \partial [v_1, v_2, v_3]
  \,.
$$

This shows that the Jacobi identity holds up to an "exact" term, hence up to homotopy.

=--

### Reformulation in terms of semifree differential coalgebra
 {#ReformulationInSemifreeDgCoalgebra}

A little later it was realized that the above huge sum expressions above just expresses the fact that the differential $D$ in a semifree [[dg-coalgebra]] squares to 0, $D^2 = 0$:


An **$L_\infty$-algebra** is 

* an $\mathbb{N}_+$-graded vector space $\mathfrak{g}$;

* equipped with a differential $D : \vee^\bullet \mathfrak{g} \to \vee^\bullet \mathfrak{g}$ of degree $-1$ on the [[free graded co-commutative coalgebra]] over $\mathfrak{g}$ that squares to 0

$$
  D^2 = 0
  \,.
$$

Here the free graded co-commutative co-algebra $\vee^\bullet \mathfrak{g}$ is, as a vector space, the same as the graded [[Grassmann algebra]] $\wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}$ whose elements we write as 

$$
  3 t_1 \vee t_2 + t_3 + t_3 \vee t_4 \vee t_5
$$

etc (where the $\vee$ is just a funny way to write the wedge $\wedge$, in order to remind us that:...)

but throught of as equipped with the standard coproduct

$$
  \Delta (v_1 \vee v_2 \cdots \vee v_n)
  \propto \sum_i \pm (v_1 \vee \cdots \vee v_i) \otimes (v_{i+1} \vee \cdots \vee v_n)
$$

> (work out or see the references for the signs and prefacors).

Since this is a _free_ graded co-commutative coalgebra, one can see that any differential 

$$
  D : \vee^\bullet \mathfrak{g} \to \vee^\bullet \mathfrak{g}
$$

on it is fixed by its value "on cogenerators" (a statement that is maybe unfamiliar, but simply the straightforward dual of the more familar statement to which we come below, that differentials on free graded algebras are fixed by their action on generators) which means that we can decompose $D$ as

$$
  D = D_1 +  D_2 + D_3 + \cdots
  \,,
$$

where each $D_i$ acts as $l_i$ when evaluated on a homogeneous element of the form $t_1 \vee \cdots \vee t_n$ and is then uniquely extended to all of $\vee^\bullet \mathfrak{g}$ by extending it as a _coderivation_ on a coalgebra.

For instance $D_2$ acts on homogeneous elements of word lenght 3 as

$$
  D_2(t_1 \vee t_2 \vee t_3) = 
  D_2(t_1, t_2)\vee t_3 \pm permutations
  \,.
$$

> exercise for the reader: spell this all out more in detail with all the signs and everyrthing. Possibly by looking it up in the references given below.

Using this, one checks that the simple condition that $D$ squares to 0 is precisely equivalent to the infinite tower of generalized Jacobi identities:


$$
  (D^2 = 0)
  \Leftrightarrow
  \left(
    \forall n : 
  \sum_{i+j = n} \sum_{shuffles \sigma}
  \pm l_i (l_j (v_{\sigma(1)}, \cdots, v_{\sigma(j)}
   , v_{\sigma(j+1) , \cdots , v_{\sigma(n)}}
  ) )
  = 0
  \right)
  \,.
$$

So in conclusion we have:

+-- {: .standout}

An $L_\infty$-algebra is a [[dg-coalgebra]] whose underlying [[coalgebra]] is cofree and concentrated in negative degree.

=--


### Reformulation in terms of semifree differential algebra 
 {#ReformulationInTermsOfSemifreeDGAlgebra}

The reformulation of an $L_\infty$-algebra as simply a semi-co-free graded-co-commutative coalgebra $(\vee^\bullet \mathfrak{g}, D)$ is a useful repackaging of the original definition, but the coalgebraic aspect tends to be not only unfamiliar, but also a bit inconvenient. At least when the graded vector space $\mathfrak{g}$ is degreewise [[finite number|finite]] [[dimension|dimensional]] , we can simply pass to its degreewise dual graded vector space $\mathfrak{g}^*$. 

(Fully generally the following works when using not just dg-algebras but [[pro-objects]] in [[dg-algebras]], see at _[model structure for L-infinity algebras -- Use of pro-dg-algebras](model+structure+for+L-infinity+algebras#OnProAlg)_).

Its [[Grassmann algebra]] $\wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^*$ is then naturally equipped with an ordinary differential $d = D^*$ which acts on $\omega \in \wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^*$ as

$$
  (d \omega) (t_1 \vee \cdots \vee t_n) =
  \pm \omega(D(t_1 \vee \cdots \vee t_n))
  \,.
$$

When the grading-dust has settled one finds that with 

$$
  \wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^* =
  k \oplus \mathfrak{g}^*_1 \oplus (\mathfrak{g}^*_1 \wedge \mathfrak{g}^*_1 \oplus \mathfrak{g}^*_2) \oplus \cdots
$$

with the ground field in degree 0, the degree 1-elements of $\mathfrak{g}^*$ in degree 1, etc, that $d$ is of degree +1 and of course squares to 0

$$
  d^2 = 0
  \,.
$$

This means that we have a [[semifree dga]]

$$
  CE(\mathfrak{g}) := (\wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^*, d)
  \,.
$$

In the case that $\mathfrak{g}$ happens to be an ordinary [[Lie algebra]], this is the ordinary [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] of this Lie algebra. Hence we should generally call $CE(\mathfrak{g})$ the [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]]
of the $L_\infty$-algebra $\mathfrak{g}$.

One observes that this construction is bijective: every (degreewise finite dimensional) cochain [[semifree dga]] generated in positive degree comes from a (degreewise finite dimensional) $L_\infty$-algebra this way.

This means that we may just as well _define_ a (degreewise finite dimensional) $L_\infty$-algebra as an object in the [[opposite category]] of (degreewise finite dimensional) commutative [[dg-algebra]]s that are [[semifree dga]]s and generated in positive degree.

And this turns out to be one of the most useful perspectives on $L_\infty$-algebras.

In particular, if we simply drop the condition that the dg-algebra be generated in positive degree and allow it to be generated in non-negative degree over the algebra in degree 0, then we have the notion of the (Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra of) an [[L-infinity-algebroid]]. 

#### Details
  {#DGAlgebraDetails}

We discuss in explit detail the computation that shows that an $L_\infty$-algebra structure on $\mathfrak{g}$ is equivalently a [[dg-algebra]]-structure on $\wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^*$.

Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a degreewise finite-dimensional $\mathbb{N}_+$[[graded vector space]] equipped with multilinear graded-symmetric maps

$$
  [-,\cdots,-]_k : Sym^k \mathfrak{g} \to \mathfrak{g}
$$

of degree -1, for each $k \in \mathbb{N}_+$. 

Let $\{t_a\}$ be a [[basis]] of $\mathfrak{g}$ and $\{t^a\}$ a dual basis of the degreewise dual $\mathfrak{g}^*$. Equip the [[Grassmann algebra]] $Sym^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^*$ with a [[derivation]]

$$
  d : Sym^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^* \to Sym^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^*
$$

defined on generators by

$$
  d : t^a 
    \mapsto 
    -
   \sum_{k = 1}^\infty 
    \frac{1}{k!}
   [t_{a_1}, \cdots, t_{a_k}]^a_k
   \,
   t^{a_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge t^{a_k}
  \,.
$$

Here we take $t^a$ to be of the same degree as $t_a$. Therefore this derivation has degree +1.

We compute the square $d^2 = d \circ d$:

$$
  \begin{aligned}
    d d t^a 
      &= 
    d (-1)\sum_{k = 1}^\infty 
    \frac{1}{k!}
    [t_{a_1}, \cdots, t_{a_k}]^a_k
   \,
   t^{a_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge t^{a_k}
    \\
    & = 
    \sum_{k,l = 1}^\infty
    \frac{1}{(k-1)! l!}
    [[t_{b_1}, \cdots, t_{b_l}], t_{a_2}, \cdots, t_{a_k}]^a
    \,
    t^{b_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge t^{b_l}  
    \wedge  
    t^{a_2} \wedge \cdots \wedge t^{a_{k}}
  \end{aligned}
  \,.
$$

Here the wedge product on the right projects the nested bracket onto its graded-symmetric components. This is produced by summing over all [[permutation]]s $\sigma \in \Sigma_{k+l-1}$ weighted by the Koszul-[[signature]] of the permutation:

$$
  \cdots = 
    \sum_{k,l = 1}^\infty
    \frac{1}{(k+l-1)!}
    \sum_{\sigma \in \Sigma_{k+l-1}}
    (-1)^{sgn(\sigma)}
    \frac{1}{(k-1)! l!}
    [[t_{b_1}, \cdots, t_{b_l}], t_{a_2}, \cdots, t_{a_k}]^a
    \,
    t^{b_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge t^{b_l}  
    \wedge  
    t^{a_2} \wedge \cdots \wedge t^{a_{k}}
  \,.
$$

The sum over all permutations decomposes into a sum over the $(l,k-1)$-[[unshuffle]]s and a sum over permutations that act inside the first $l$ and the last $(k-1)$ indices.
By the graded-symmetry of the bracket, the latter  do not change the value of the nested bracket. Since there are $(k-1)! l!$ many of them, we get

$$
  \cdots 
    =
    \sum_{k,l = 1}^\infty
    \frac{1}{(k+l-1)!}
    \sum_{\sigma \in Unsh(l,k-1)}
    (-1)^{sgn(\sigma)}
    [[t_{a_1}, \cdots, t_{a_l}], t_{a_{l+1}}, \cdots, t_{a_{k+l-1}}]
    \,
    t^{a_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge t^{a_{k+l-1}}
  \,.
$$

Therefore the condition $d^2 = 0$ is equivalent to the condition 

$$
    \sum_{k+l = n-1}
    \sum_{\sigma \in Unsh(l,k-1)}
    (-1)^{sgn(\sigma)}
    [[t_{a_1}, \cdots, t_{a_l}], t_{a_{l+1}}, \cdots, t_{a_{k+l-1}}]
  = 0
$$

for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and all $\{t_{a_i} \in \mathfrak{g}\}$. This is equation (eq:LInfinityJacobiIdentity) which says that $\{\mathfrak{g}, \{[-,\dots,-]_k\}\}$ is an $L_\infty$-algebra.


### In terms of algebras over an operad

$L_\infty$-algebras are precisely the  [[algebras over an operad]] of the cofibrant resolution of the [[Lie operad]]. 


## Examples

### Special cases

* An $L_\infty$-algebra for which $V$ is concentrated in the first $n$ degree is a **Lie $n$-algebra** (sometimes also: "$L_n$-algebra").

* An $L_\infty$-algebra for which only the unary operation and the binary bracket are non-trivial is a **[[dg-Lie algebra]]**: a [[Lie algebra]] [[internalization|internal to]] the [[category]] of [[dg-algebras]]. From the point of view of higher Lie theory this is a **strict $L_\infty$-algebra**: one for which the Jacobi identity does happen to hold "on the nose", not just up to nontrivial coherent isomorphisms.

* So in particular 

  * an $L_\infty$-algebra generated just in degree 1 is an ordinary **[[Lie algebra]]** ;

  * an $L_\infty$-algebra generated just in degree 1 and 2 is a **[[Lie 2-algebra]]** ;

    * an $L_\infty$-algebra generated just in degree 1 and 2 and with at most binary brackets is a **[[strict Lie 2-algebra]]** , equivalently encoded in a [[differential crossed module]].

  * an $L_\infty$-algebra generated just in degree 1, 2 and 3 is a **[[Lie 3-algebra]]** ;

* if $\mathfrak{g}$ is a Lie algebra over $\mathbf{K}$, and $b^{k-1}\mathbb{K}$ is the complex consisting of the field $\mathbb{K}$ in degree $1-k$, then an $L_\infty$-algebra morphism from $\mathfrak{g}$ to $b^{k-1}\mathbb{K}$ is precisely a degree $k$ [[Lie algebra cohomology|Lie algebra cocycle]].

* The skew-symmetry of the Lie bracket is retained strictly in $L_\infty$-algebras. It is expected that weakening this, too, yields a more general [[vertical categorification]] of Lie algebras. For $n=2$ this has been worked out by Dmitry Roytenberg: [On weak Lie 2-algebras](http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.3461).

* The [[horizontal categorification]] of $L_\infty$-algebras are $L_\infty$-[[Lie infinity-algebroid|algebroid]]s.

* An $L_\infty$-algebra with only $D_n$ non-vanishing is called an **[[n-Lie algebra]]** -- to be distinguished from a _Lie $n$-algebra_ ! However, in large parts of the literature $n$-Lie algebras are considered for which $D_n$ is _not_ of the required homogeneous degree in the grading, or in which no grading is considered in the first place. Such $n$-Lie algebras are not special examples of $L_\infty$-algebras, then. For more see [[n-Lie algebra]].

* An $L_\infty$-alghebra internal to [[super vector space]]s is a [[super L-∞ algebra]].

### Classes of examples

* [[automorphism Lie 2-algebra]]

* [[inner derivation Lie 2-algebra]]

* [[automorphism ∞-Lie algebra]]

* For every $\infty$-Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ there is its [[automorphism ∞-Lie algebra]]. In terms of [[rational homotopy theory]] this models the rational automorphism group of the [[rational space]] corresponding to $\mathfrak{g}$.

* [[Poisson-bracket Lie n-algebra]]

* [[Heisenberg Lie n-algebra]] of an [[n-plectic manifold]] or more generally of an [[n-plectic smooth infinity-groupoid]]

### Specific examples

* [[line Lie n-algebra]]

* [[string Lie 2-algebra]]

* [[fivebrane Lie 6-algebra]]

* [[supergravity Lie 3-algebra]]

* [[supergravity Lie 6-algebra]]

## Properties

### Model category structure 

See [[model structure for L-∞ algebras]].

### Relation to dg-Lie algebras

Every [[dg-Lie algebra]] is in an evident way an $L_\infty$-algebra. Dg-Lie algebras are precisely those $L_\infty$-algebras for which all $n$-ary brackets for $n \gt 2$ are trivial. These may be thought of as the _strict_ $L_\infty$-algebras: those for which the [[Jacobi identity]] holds on the nose and all its possible higher coherences are trivial.

+-- {: .num_theorem}
###### Theorem

Let $k$ be a [[field]] of [[characteristic]] 0 and write $L_\infty Alg_k$ for the [[category]] of $L\infty$-algebras over $k$. 

Then every object of $L_\infty Alg_k$ is [[quasi-isomorphism|quasi-isomorphic]] to a [[dg-Lie algebra]].

Moreover, one can find a functorial replacement: there is a [[functor]]

$$
  W : L_\infty Alg_k \to L_\infty Alg_k
$$

such that for each $\mathfrak{g} \in L_\infty Alg_k$ 

1. $W(\mathfrak{k})$ is a [[dg-Lie algebra]];

1. there is a [[quasi-isomorphism]]

   $$
     \mathfrak{g} \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
     W(\mathfrak{g})
     \,.

In the [[supergravity]] literature these CE-algebras are referred to as "FDA"s. This is short for "free differential algebra", which is a slight misnomer for what in mathematics are called [[semifree dga]]s (or sometimes "quasi-free" dga-s).

The translation of [[D'Auria-Fré formulation of supergravity|D'Auro-Fré formalism]] to explicit ([[super L-∞ algebra|super]]) $L_\infty$-algebra language is made in

#### In BV-BRST formalism
 {#ReferencesBVBRSTFormalism}

The understanding that the [[BV-BRST complex]] used in physics to model the [[derived critical locus]] of the [[action functionals]] of [[gauge theories]] is mathematically the [[formal dual]] [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] of a [[derived L-∞ algebroid]] originates around

The [[L-∞ algebroid]]-structure is also made explicit in ([def. 4.1 of v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.4001v1)) of ([Sati-Schreiber-Stasheff 09](#SatiSchreiberStasheff09)).

#### In string field theory

The first _explicit_ appearance of $L_\infty$-algebras in theoretical physics is the $L_\infty$-algebra structure on the [[BRST complex]] of the [[closed string|closed]] [[bosonic string]] found in the context of closed bosonic [[string field theory]] in

Generalization to open-closed bosonic string field theory yields [[L-∞ algebra]] interacting with [[A-∞ algebra]]:

#### In heterotic string theory

Next it was again $L_\infty$-algebras of [[finite type]] that drew attention. It was eventually understood that the [[string structures]] which embody a refinement of the [[Green-Schwarz anomaly cancellation]] mechanism in [[heterotic string theory]] have a further smooth refinement as [[G-structures]] for the [[string 2-group]], which is the [[Lie integration]] of a [[Lie 2-algebra]] called the _[[string Lie 2-algebra]]_. This is due to

* {#BCSS} [[John Baez]], [[Alissa Crans]], [[Urs Schreiber]], [[Danny Stevenson]], _From loop groups to 2-groups_, _Homotopy, Homology and Applications_ **9** (2007), 101-135.  ([arXiv:math.QA/0504123](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.QA/0504123))

and the relation to the Green-Schwarz mechanism is made explicit in 

* {#SatiSchreiberStasheff09} [[Hisham Sati]], [[Urs Schreiber]], [[Jim Stasheff]], _[[schreiber:Twisted Differential String and Fivebrane Structures]]_, Communications in Mathematical Physics, 2012, Volume 315, Issue 1, pp 169-213  ([arXiv:0910.4001](http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.4001))

This article also observes that an analogous situation appears in [[dual heterotic string theory]] with the _[[fivebrane Lie 6-algebra]]_ in place of the string Lie 2-algebra.

#### Higher Chern-Simons field theory and AKSZ sigma-models

Ordinary [[Chern-Simons theory]] for a simple gauge group is all controled by a [[Lie algebra cohomology|Lie algebra 3-cocycle]]. The generalization of Chern-Simons theory to [[AKSZ-sigma models]] was understood to be encoded by [[symplectic Lie n-algebroids]] (later re-popularized as "[[shifted symplectic structures]]") in 

* [[Dmitry Roytenberg]], _Courant algebroids, derived brackets and even symplectic supermanifolds_ PhD thesis ([arXiv:9910078](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/9910078))

* [[Pavol Ševera]], _[[Some title containing the words "homotopy" and "symplectic", e.g. this one]]_, based on a talk at "Poisson 2000", CIRM Marseille, June 2000; ([arXiv:0105080](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0105080))


* [[Dmitry Roytenberg]], _On the structure of graded symplectic supermanifolds and Courant algebroids_ in _Quantization, Poisson Brackets and Beyond_ , [[Theodore Voronov]] (ed.), Contemp. Math., Vol. 315, Amer. Math. Soc., Providence, RI, 2002 ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0203110))

The globally defined AKSZ action functionals obtained this way were shown in 

* [[Domenico Fiorenza]], [[Chris Rogers]], [[Urs Schreiber]], _[[schreiber:AKSZ Sigma-Models in Higher Chern-Weil Theory]]_, Int. J. Geom. Methods Mod. Phys. 10 (2013) 1250078 ([arXiv:1108.4378](http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.4378))

Further exmaples of non-symplectic $L_\infty$-Chern-Simons theory obtained this way include [[7-dimensional Chern-Simons theory]] on [[differential string structure|string 2-connections]]:

#### In local prequantum field theory

Infinite-dimensional $L_\infty$-algebras that behaved similar to [[Poisson bracket]] [[Lie algebras]] -- _[[Poisson bracket Lie n-algebras]]_ -- were noticed

* {#Rogers10} [[Chris Rogers]], _$L_\infty$ algebras from multisymplectic geometry_ ,  Letters in Mathematical Physics April 2012, Volume 100, Issue 1, pp 29-50  ([arXiv:1005.2230](http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.2230), [journal](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11005-011-0493-x)).

* {#Rogers11} [[Chris Rogers]], _Higher symplectic geometry_ PhD thesis (2011) ([arXiv:1106.4068](http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.4068))

In 

* [[Domenico Fiorenza]], [[Chris Rogers]], [[Urs Schreiber]], _[[schreiber:L-∞ algebras of local observables from higher prequantum bundles ]]_, Homology, Homotopy and Applications, Volume 16 (2014) Number 2, p. 107 – 142 ([arXiv:1304.6292](http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.6292))

these were shown to be the infinitesimal version of the symmetries of [[prequantum n-bundles]] as they appear in [[local prequantum field theory]], in higher generalization of how the [[Poisson bracket]] is the Lie algebra of the [[quantomorphism group]].

These also encode a homotopy refinement of the [[Dickey bracket]] on [[Noether theorem|Noether]] [[conserved currents]] which for [[Green-Schwarz sigma models]] reduces to Lie $n$-algebras of [[BPS charges]] which refine [[super Lie algebras]] such as the   [[M-theory super Lie algebra]]:

* [[Hisham Sati]], [[Urs Schreiber]], _[[schreiber:Lie n-algebras of BPS charges]]_ ([arXiv:1507.08692](http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.08692))

* [[Igor Khavkine]], [[Urs Schreiber]], _[[schreiber:Lie n-algebras of higher Noether currents ]]_

This makes concrete the suggestion that there should be $L_\infty$-algebra refinements of the [[Dickey bracket]] of [[conserved currents]] in [[local field theory]] that was made in 

* [[Glenn Barnich]], [[Ronald Fulp]], [[Tom Lada]], [[Jim Stasheff]], _The sh Lie structure of Poisson brackets in field theory_ ([arXiv:hep-th/9702176](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9702176))
