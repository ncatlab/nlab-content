## Idea

Given a [[category]] of 

* [[topological G-spaces]] or of [[(infinity,1)-presheaves]] on the $G$-[[orbit category]], hence in the context of $G$-[[equivariant homotopy theory]];

* [[G-manifolds]], hence in the context of $G$-[[equivariant differential topology]];

where all [[morphisms]] are (represented by) $G$-[[equivariant functions]], the [[group]] $G$ may be called the underlying _equivariance group_.
