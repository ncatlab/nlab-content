## Idea

The _virtually fibered conjecture_ says that every [[closed manifold|closed]], [[irreducible manifold|irreducible]], [[atoroidal 3-manifold|atoroidal]] [[3-manifold]] with infinite [[fundamental group]] has a [[finite cover]] which is a [[surface]] [[fiber bundle]] over the [[circle]].

A proof was announced by [[Ian Agol]] in 2012, based on work by [[Daniel Wise]].
