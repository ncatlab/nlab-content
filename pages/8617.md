## Idea

The notion of _complex analytic space_ is the notion of _[[analytic space]]_ in [[complex geometry]]; the generalization of the notion of [[complex manifold]] to spaces with [[singularity|singularities]].


## Definition

A _complex analytic test space_ is a common vanishing locus of a set of [[holomorphic functions]] $\mathbb{C}^n \to \mathbb{C}$. This is naturally a [[locally ringed space]] over the [[complex numbers]] $\mathbb{C}$. A complex analytic space is a [[locally ringed space]] over $\mathbb{C}$ that is locally isomorphic to such a complex analytic test space.


## Properties

### Local contractibility

A _smooth_ complex analytic space is locally isomorphic to a [[polydisc]] and hence locally contractible. See also ([Berkovich, p.2](#Berkovich)).
