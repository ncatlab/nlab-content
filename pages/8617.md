## Idea

The notion of _complex analytic space_ is the notion of _[[analytic space]]_ in [[complex geometry]]; the generalization of the notion of [[complex manifold]] to spaces with [[singularities]].

## Definition

A _complex analytic test space_ is a common vanishing locus of a set of [[holomorphic functions]] $\mathbb{C}^n \to \mathbb{C}$. This is naturally a [[locally ringed space]] over the [[complex numbers]] $\mathbb{C}$. A complex analytic space is a [[locally ringed space]] over $\mathbb{C}$ that is locally isomorphic to such a complex analytic test space.
