### On an abelian group

For $(A,+)$ an [[abelian group]], then a _norm_ on the group is a [[function]]

$$
  {\vert-\vert} \;\colon\; G \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$

to the [[real numbers]], such that 

1. (positivity) $(g \neq 0) \Rightarrow (\vert g\vert \gt 0)$

1. ([[triangle inequality]])  ${\vert g + h\vert}\leq {\vert g\vert} + {\vert h\vert}$ 

1. (linearity) ${\vert k g\vert} = {\vert k\vert} {\vert g\vert}$ for all $k \in \mathbb{Z}$.

Here ${\vert k\vert} \in \mathbb{N}$ denotes the [[absolute value]].

A group with a norm is a _[[normed group]]_, see there for more.

### On a vector space

For $k$ a [[field]] equipped with a [[valuation]] (most usually, a [[local field]] such as $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{C}$, or a [[p-adic field|p-adic]] [[complete field|completion]] of a [[number field]]), a **norm** on a $k$-[[vector space]] $V$ is a [[function]] 

$$
  {\vert-\vert} \colon V \to \mathbb{R}
$$ 

such that for all $\lambda \in k$, $v,w \in V$ we have

1.  ${\vert \lambda v \vert} = {\vert \lambda\vert} {\vert v \vert}$ (where $\vert \lambda \vert$ denotes the [[valuation]])

1.  ${\vert v + w\vert } \leq {\vert v \vert } + {\vert w \vert}$ ("[[triangle inequality]]")

1.  if ${\vert v\vert} = 0$ then $v = 0$.

If the third property is not required, one speaks of a **seminorm**.

If the triangle identity is strengthened to 

* ${\vert v + w\vert } \leq max ({\vert v\vert}, {\vert w\vert})$

one speaks of a **non-archimedean** seminorm.

A vector space equipped with a norm is a **normed vector space**. 

Each seminorm determines a [[topology]], which is [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] precisely if it is a norm.

A [[topological vector space]] is called **(semi-)normed** if its [[topology]] can be induced by a (semi-)norm.

Two seminorms ${\vert - \vert}_1$ and ${\vert - \vert}_2$ are called **equivalent** if there are $0 \lt C, C' \in \mathbb{R}$ such that for all $v$ we have

$$
  C {\vert v \vert}_1 \leq {\vert v \vert}_2
  \leq C' {\vert v \vert}_1
  \,.
$$

Equivalent seminorms determine the same [[topology]].

The collection of (bounded) multiplicative seminorms on a ([[Banach space|Banach]]) [[ring]] is called its [[analytic spectrum]] (see there for details).


## Examples

### General

* The standard [[absolute value]] is a norm on the [[real numbers]].

* More generally, on any [[Cartesian space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ the **Euclidean norm** is given by

  $$
    (x^1, \cdots, x^n) \mapsto \sqrt(\sum_{i=1}^n (x^i)^2)
    \,.
  $$


### Minkowski Functionals

Let $V$ be a vector space and $B \subseteq V$ an [[absorbing]] [[absolutely convex]] subset.  The **Minkowski functional** of $B$ is the function $\mu_B \colon V \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by:

$$
\mu_B(v) = \inf\{t \gt 0 : v \in t B\}
$$

This is a semi-norm on $V$.
