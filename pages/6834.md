## Idea

A general [[gauge field]] is a [[cocycle]] in [[differential cohomology]]. The case of the [[electromagnetic field]] and the [[Yang-Mills field]]s with 2-form [[curvature]] is just a very special case of this, in general a gauge field has higher [[curvature]] forms. For instance the [[B-field]] has a curvature 3-form, the [[C3-field]] has a curvature 4-form and the [[RR-field]] has a curvature form in every even or every odd degree.

For emphasis, therefore, one sometimes speaks of **higher gauge fields** and **higher gauge theory** , where the "higher" is as in _[[higher category theory]]_ . Indeed, where an ordinary [[Yang-Mills field]] is a [[connection on a bundle]] defined in ordinary category theory, a higher gauge field is modeled by a [[connection on a 2-bundle]] or generally by a [[connection on a principal infinity-bundle]].

See [[gauge theory]] for more.
