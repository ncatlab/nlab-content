## Idea

In astrophysics/[[cosmology]], the _KBC void_ ([KBC13](#KBC13)) refers to a large neighbourhood of the [[Milky Way]] whose average matter density is considerably smaller than on average in the [[observable universe]].

In the context of [[inhomogeneous cosmology]], this means that the [[Hubble constant]] effectively observed inside the void appears larger than that given by the [[cosmological constant]] of a large-scale homogeneous [[FRW model]]. It has been suggested that this might explain away the need for the [[dark energy]] hypothesis, or at least help explain recent tensions in different measurements of the [[Hubble constant]], but the issue remains debated ([Wu-Huterer 17](#WuHuterer17)).
