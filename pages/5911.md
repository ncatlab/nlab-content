## Definition

An **infinitary [[coherent category]]** or **geometric category** is a [[well-powered category|well-powered]] [[regular category]] in which the [[subobject]] [[poset]]s $Sub(X)$ have all _small_ [[union]]s which are [[pullback stability|stable under pullback]].  

+-- {: .query}
[[Mike Shulman]]: I'm starting to feel that well-poweredness shouldn't be included here.  Any thoughts?

Toby:  It allows us to conclude that $Sub(X)$ also has all intersections.  I'll be using this at [[real number object]] to construct an NNO out of an RNO.

## Properties

See [[familial regularity and exactness]] for a general description of the spectrum from regular categories through finitary and infinitary coherent categories.
