## Idea 

Dehn surgery is a method for constructing one manifold from another, especially one [[3-manifold]] from another, by a kind of cut-and-paste procedure. 

## Method 

A standard application of Dehn surgery is [[surgery]] along a [[link]] $L$ in a [[3-sphere]] $S^3$. This works in two steps (whose description makes it sound like *Zahn* surgery[^1]): 

[^1]: Yes, that's supposed to be a little joke. 'Zahn' here is the German word. 

* Remove or excise from $S^3$ a [[tubular neighborhood]] of the embedded link $L \hookrightarrow S^3$, of the form $L \times int(D^2)$. This is called *Dehn drilling*. The result is a 3-manifold with boundary $M$, whose boundary $\partial M \cong L \times S^1$ can be viewed as the boundary of a disjoint union of solid tori $L \times D^2$. 

* To each of the components $C_1, \ldots, C_n$ of $\partial M$, apply an (orientation-preserving) homeomorphism, say $\phi_1, \ldots, \phi_n$. The union $\phi_1 \cup \ldots \cup \phi_n$ is a homeomorphism $\phi: \partial M \to \partial M$. Then perform a *Dehn filling* by constructing the [[pushout]] of an evident [[span]]: 
$$\array{
\partial M & \stackrel{\phi}{\to} & \partial M \\ 
\mathllap{incl} \downarrow & & \downarrow \mathrlap{incl} \\
M & & L \times D^2,
}$$ 
thus refilling the drilled portion, but in a new way (along $\phi$). This gives a new 3-manifold $N$. 

Some further notes: the surgery can be done one solid torus at a time. A homeomorphism on a boundary torus $S^1 \times S^1$ sends a meridian $S_1 \times \{1\}$ to some simple closed curve that is homotopic to a curve of rational slope $p/q$ (the curve which is the image of the line $y = (p/q)x$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ under the quotient map $\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2/\mathbb{Z}^2 \cong S^1 \times S^1$). It turns out that the result of the surgery depends, up to homeomorphism, only on the quantity $p/q$, called a *surgery coefficient*. If all the surgery coefficients are integers, we speak of an *integral surgery*. 

Put a bit different: given a [[framed link]] in an oriented 3-manifold like $S^3$, an integral surgery drills out a solid torus, [[Dehn twist|twists]] it an integral number of times according to the framing, and then reattaches it. 

## Results

###### Theorem 
**(Lickorish-Wallace)** 
Every [[connected space|connected]] [[orientation|oriented]] [[closed manifold|closed]] 3-manifold $N$ arises by performing an integral Dehn surgery along a link $L \hookrightarrow S^3$ (i.e., surgery along a framed link).
