## Idea

The notion of _blob $n$-category_ captures the notion of an [[n-category]] with all duals. It is formulated in the style of [[hyperstructure]]: without any distinction between source and targets.

The definition is well-adapted to describing the [[(infinity,n)-category of cobordisms]] in the spirit of [[blob homology]].

## Definition

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ be a [[natural number]].

+-- {: .un_defn #BlobGraph}
###### Definition 

A **blob $n$-graph** $C$ is given by

* for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ a [[functor]] 

  $$
    C_k : core(Ball_k) \to Set
  $$ 

  from the [[groupoid]] of [[topological space]]s [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to a $k$-[[ball]] and [[homeomorphism]]s between them to [[Set]].

=--

We think of $C(B^k)$ as the set of [[k-morphism]]s in the $n$-graph $C$. This means that the [[geometric shape for higher structures]] used here is the [[globe]]. Therefore the term _blob_ . 

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition (roughly)

A **blob $n$-category** $C$ is 

* a [blob n-graph](#BlobGraph) $C$;

* for each $k$ a [[natural transformation]] -- **boundary restriction** 
  (source/target)
 
  $$
    \partial : C_k(X) \to \underset{\to}{C}_{k-1}(\partial X)
    \,,
  $$

  where on the right we have the extension to $(k-1)$ spheres of $C_{k-1}$
  described [below](#ExtensionToGeneralShapes);

* for all balls $B = B_1 \cup_{B_1 \cap B_2} B_2$ and $E := \partial (B_1 \cap B_2)$ a natural transformation -- **composition**

  $$
    \circ : C(B_1) \times_{C(B_1 \cap B_2)} C(B_2) \to C(B)
  $$

  satisfying some compatibility conditions

* for all balls $X$, $D$ a natural map -- **identity** --

  $$
    C(X) \to C(X \times D)
  $$

  satisfying some compatibility conditions.

###### Definition (roughly)
**(extension to general shapes)**

For $C$ a blob n-graph and $X$ any $k$-[[dimension]]al [[manifold]] with $k \leq n$, define $\underset{\to}{C}(X)$ to be  the [[colimit]]

$$
  \underset{\to}{C}(X) := {\lim_{\to}}_{({\coprod_i U_i \to X})} 
   \left( fiber\;product\;of\;C(U_i)s\;over\;joint\;boundary\;labels \right)
$$

over the category of _permissible decompositions_ (...) of $X$, where the composition operation in $C$ is used to label refinements of permissible decompositions.

## Examples

* Fundamental $n$-category of a topological space

  For $X$ a [[topological space]], let $\Pi_{\leq n}(X)$ be the blob $n$-category which sends a $k$-ball for $k \lt n$ to the set of [[continuous map]] of the ball into $X$, and an $n$-ball to the set of [[homotopy]]-classes of such maps, relative boundary.

  This is ([MorrisonWalker, example 6.2.1](#MorrisonWalker))).

* bordism $n$-category

  The blob $n$-category $Bord_n$ of $n$-dimensional [[cobordism]]s sends a $k$-ball $B$ for $k \lt n$ to the set of $k$-dimensional submanifolds $W \hookrightarrow B \times \mathbb{R}^\infty$ such that the projection $W \to B$ is transverse to $\partial B$. An $n$-ball is sent to homeomorphism classes rel boundary of such submanifolds.

  This is ([MorrisonWalker, example 6.2.6](#MorrisonWalker))).
