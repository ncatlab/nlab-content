
The term "phase" appears in different contexts:

* the phase of a [[complex number]] $c$ is the real number $\phi$ in the decomposition $c = {\vert c \vert} e^{i \phi}$;

* the phase of a [[wave function]] in [[physics]] is just this complex phase, the wave function being (locally) a function with values in the complex numbers;

* correspondingly then the _phase difference_ between two linearly dependent vectors of a complex [[Hilbert space]] is the phase of the complex number that relates them;

* in [[thermodynamics]] and [[statistical physics]] different _phases_ of a [[physical system]] label different order parameters that distinguish macroscopically different regions of the configuraton space of the system;

* the [[phase space]] of a [[physical system]] is its space of classical solutions (for a relation of this to the phase of a [[wave function]] above see at _[[phase and phase space in physics]]_).
