## Idea

The analog of the notion of [[opposite category]] for [[(∞,1)-categories]].

## Definition

For $C$ an [[(∞,1)-category]] regard it in its incarnation as a [[∞-groupoid]]-[[enriched category]]. Then its opposite is the $(\infty,1)$-category $C^{op}$ with the same objects and with [[hom-object]]s given by

$$
  C^{op}(X,Y) := C(Y,X)
$$

with the obvious composition law.

## Properties

The operation extends to an [[automorphism|automorphic]] [[(∞,1)-functor]] 

$$
  op : (\infty,1)Cat \to (\infty,1)Cat
$$

from [[(∞,1)Cat]] to itself. Up to equivalence, this is the only nontrivial such automorphism. For more on this see [[(∞,1)Cat]].
