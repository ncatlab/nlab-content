## Idea

Cartesian fibrations are one of the types of [[fibrations of quasi-categories]].

A _Cartesian fibration_ of [[simplicial set]]s is a morphism between [[simplicial sets]] that generalizes the notion of [[Grothendieck fibration]] from [[category|categories]] to [[quasi-category|quasi-categories]].

This means that precisely if an [[∞-functor]] $p : C \to D$ if a Cartesian fibration is it possible to interpret its value over any [[morphism]] $f : d_1 \to d_2$ in $D$ as an [[∞-functor]] $p^{-1}(f) : p^{-1}(d_2) \to p^{-1}(d_1)$ between the [[fibers]] $p^{-1}(d_2)$ and $p^{-1}(d_1)$ over its source and target [[objects]]. 

So a Cartesian fibration $p : C \to D$ determines and is determined by an [[∞-functor]] $S_p : D \to (\infty,1)Cat^{op}$ from $D$ into the [[opposite category]] of the  [[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-categories]].

This correspondence is mediated by the [[universal fibration of (∞,1)-categories]] which is a Cartesian fibration $p_{univ}: Z \to (\infty,1)Cat$ such that for every Cartesian fibration $p : C \to D$ there is a functor $S_p : D \to (\infty,1)Cat^{op}$ such that $p$ is the ($(\infty,1)$-categorical) [[pullback]] of $p_{univ}$

$$
  \array{
    C &\to& Z
    \\
    \downarrow^p && \downarrow^{p_{univ}}
    \\
    D &\stackrel{S_p}{\to}& (\infty,1)Cat^{op}
  }
  \,.
$$

As described at [[generalized universal bundle]], this pullback construction is the $(\infty,1)$-categorical analog of the [[Grothendieck construction]] for ordinary categories.

## Definition 

A Cartesian fibration is an [[inner fibration]] of simplicial sets $p : X \to S$ such that for every edge $f : X \to Y$ of $S$ and every lift $\tilde{y}$ of $y$ (that is, $p(\tilde{y})=y$), there is a [[cartesian morphism|Cartesian edge]] $\tilde{f} : \tilde{x} \to \tilde{y}$ in $X$ lifting $f$.

* Cartesian fibrations are [[pullback stability|stable under base change]] in [[SSet]].

* The composite of two Cartesian fibrations is again a Cartesian fibration.

###### Proposition (over $\infty$-groupoids)

Let $p : X \to S$ be a morphism of [[simplicial set]]s where $S$ is a [[Kan complex]]. Then the following are equivalent:

1. $p$ is a Cartesian fibration

1. $p$ is a coCartesian fibration

1. $p$ is a [[Joyal model structure on simplicial sets|categorical fibration]]
