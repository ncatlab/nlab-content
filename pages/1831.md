## Idea

Cartesian fibrations are one of the types of [[fibrations of quasi-categories]].

A _Cartesian fibration_ of quasi-categories -- or more generally of [[simplicial set]]s -- is a morphism that generalizes the notion of [[Grothendieck fibration]] from [[category theory]] to [[(∞,1)-category theory]], specifically with [[(∞,1)-categories]] incarnated as [[quasi-categories]]:

it is an [[inner fibration]] that lifts also all right _outer_ [[horn]] inclusions whose last edge is a [[cartesian morphism]], and such that there is a sufficient supply of cartesian morphisms.

If an [[(∞,1)-functor]] $p : C \to D$ if a Cartesian fibration then it possible to interpret its value over any [[morphism]] $f : d_1 \to d_2$ in $D$ as an [[(∞,1)-functor]] $p^{-1}(f) : p^{-1}(d_2) \to p^{-1}(d_1)$ between the [[fibers]] $p^{-1}(d_2)$ and $p^{-1}(d_1)$ over its source and target [[objects]]. 

This way a Cartesian fibration $p : C \to D$ determines and is determined by an [[(∞,1)-functor]] $D^{op} \to (\infty,1)Cat$ into the
[[(∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-categories]]. This is the content of the [[(∞,1)-Grothendieck construction]].

Cartesian fibrations over$S$ are the fibrant objects in the [[model structure on marked simplicial over-sets]] over $S$.

## Definition 

+-- {: .un_defn}
###### Definition

A morphism $p : X \to Y$ in [[sSet]] is a 
**Cartesian fibration** if

* it is an [[inner fibration]] 

* for every edge $f : x \to y$ of $Y$ and for every lift $\hat {y}$ of 
  $y$ (that is: $p(\hat{y})=y$)
  there is a [[cartesian morphism|Cartesian edge]] 
  $\hat{f} : \hat{x} \to \hat{y}$ in $X$ lifting $f$ 
  (that is: such that $p(\hat f) = f$)

The morphism is a Cartesian **opfibration** if the [[opposite quasi-category|opposite]] $p^{op} : X^{op} \to Y^{op}$ is a Cartesian fibation.

### General properties


+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

We have:

* Every [[isomorphism]] of [[simplicial sets]] is a Cartesian fibration.

* Cartesian fibrations are [[pullback stability|stable under pullback]] in [[SSet]].

* The composite of two Cartesian fibrations is again a Cartesian fibration.

###### Proof

This is [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, prop. 2.4.2.3 ]].

=--


We can test locally if a morphism is a Cartesian fibration:

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition

An [[inner fibration]] $p : X \to Y$ is Cartesian precisely if for every $n$-[[simplex]] $\sigma : \Delta[n] \to Y$ the [[sSet]]-[[pullback]] $\sigma^* p : X \times_Y \Delta[n]$ in

$$
  \array{
    X \times_Y \Delta[n] &\to& X
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    \Delta[n] &\stackrel{\sigma}{\to}& Y
  }
$$

is a Cartesian fibration.

###### Proof

This is  [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, cor. 2.4.2.10]].

### Relation to other kinds of fibrations

The notion of [[right fibration]] is a special case of that 
of Cartesian fibration:

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition 


The following are equivalent:

* $p : X \to Y$ is a Cartesian fibration and every edge in $X$ is 
  $p$-Cartesian

* $p$ is a [[right fibration]];

* $p$ is a Cartesian fibration and every fiber is a [[Kan complex]].

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

This is  [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, prop. 2.4.2.4]].

=--


There are also the "categorical fibrations", the fibrations in the Joyal [[model structure for quasi-categories]] on $sSet$. These turn out not to have much of an intrinsic category theoretic meaning. By the following proposition one can understand the notion of Cartesian fibration as  a suitable refinement of the notion of categorical fibration

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition 

Every Cartesian $p : X \to Y$ in [[sSet]] is a fibration with respect to the [[Andre Joyal|Joyal]] [[model structure for quasi-categories]] on [[sSet]].

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

This is  [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, prop. 3.3.1.7]].

=--


However, when the base is an $\infty$-groupoid, then the difference between Cartesian fibrations and categorical fibrations disappears:

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition (over $\infty$-groupoids)

Let $p : X \to Y$ be a morphism of [[simplicial set]]s where $Y$ is a [[Kan complex]]. Then the following are equivalent:

1. $p$ is a Cartesian fibration

1. $p$ is a coCartesian fibration

1. $p$ is a [[Joyal model structure on simplicial sets|categorical fibration]]

=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

This is  [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, prop. 3.3.1.8]].

=--

There is however another [[model category]] structure, which does model Cartesian fibrations.

+-- {: .un_prop}
###### Proposition 

Let $sSet^+/Y$ be the [[overcategory]] of the category of [[marked simplicial set]]s over $S$, equipped with the [[model structure on marked simplicial over-sets]]. 

An object $X \to Y$ is fibrant in that model category precisely if 

* the underlying morphism of simplicial sets $X \to Y$ is a Cartesian fibration;

* the marked edges in $X$ are precisely the [[Cartesian morphism]]s.


=--

+-- {: .proof}
###### Proof

This is  [[Higher Topos Theory|HTT, prop. 3.1.4.1]].
