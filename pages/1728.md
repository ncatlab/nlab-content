## Idea

A [[quantum field theory]] _with defects_ is, roughly a quantum field theory that assigns data not just to plain [[manifolds]]/[[cobordisms]], but to spaces that may carry certain singularities and/or colorings. At the locus of such a singularity the [[bulk]] field theory may then undergo transitions.

Such defects are known by many names. In [[codimension]] 1 they are often called [[domain walls]]. If they are [[boundaries]] they are often called _[[branes]]_, the corresponding domain walls are then sometimes called [[bi-branes]]. Examples of Dimension-1 defects are [[Wilson lines]] and [[cosmic strings]] (at least in [[gauge theory]]) and dimension-0 defects are often called [[monopoles]].

## Definition

### General
 {#DefinitionGeneral}

A plain $n$-dimensional local [[FQFT]] (a [[bulk]] field theory) is a [[monoidal (∞,n)-functor|symmetric monoidal]] [[(∞,n)-functor]] from the [[(∞,n)-category of cobordisms]]. 

$$  
  Z : Bord_n \to \mathcal{C}^\otimes
  \,.
$$

If one replaces plain [[cobordisms]] here with cobordisms $Bord_n^{Def}$ "with singularities" including [[boundaries]] and [[corners]] but also partitions labeled in a certain index set $Def$, one calls a morphism

$$
  Z : Bord_n^{Def} \to \mathcal{C}
$$

a TQFT _with defects_. A general formalization is in ([Lurie, section 4.3](#Lurie)), see also ([Davydov-Runkel-Kong](#DavydovRunkelKong)).

Such a morphism carries data as follows:

* for each label in $Def$ of codimension 0 there is an ordinary [[bulk]] field theory;

* for each label in $Def$ of codimension 1 data on how to "connect" the two TQFTs on both sides

* etc.

So one may think of the codimension $k$ colors as _defects_ where the TQFT that one is looking at changes its nature.

In particular, when the QFT on one side of the defect is trivial, then the defect behaves like a _boundary condition_ for the remaining QFT. Since at least for $n=2$ QFT such boundary conditions are also called _[[branes]]_, defects are also called _[[bi-branes]]_.

The statement of the **cobordism theorem with singularities** ([Lurie, theorem 4.3.11](#Lurie)) is essentially the following: 

Given a [[symmetric monoidal (∞,n)-category]] $\mathcal{C}^\otimes$, then for every choice of [[pasting diagram]] of [[k-morphisms]] for all $k$, there is a type of manifolds with singularity $Def$, such that $Bord_n^Def$ is the free symmetric monoidal $(\infty,n)$-category on this data, hence such that TFTs with defects $(Bord_n^Def)^\otimes \to \mathcal{C}^\otimes$ are equivalently given by realizing such a pasting diagram in $\mathcal{C}$, where each of the given [[k-morphism]] appears as the value of a codimension $(n-k)$-defect. (See also [Lurie, remark 4.3.14](#Lurie)).


### Topological defects in gauge theory with broken symmetry

An old notion of _defects_ in field theory -- well preceeding the [above](#DefinitionGeneral) notion in the context of [[FQFT]] -- is that of [[cosmic string]]-type defects that may appear in [[gauge theory]] in the presnce of [[spontaneously broken symmetry]] (a comprehensive review in in ([Vilenkin-Shellard 94](#VilenkinShellard94)). Steps towards conceptually systematizing these broken-symmetry defects and their interaction are made in [Preskill-Vilenkin 92](#PreskillVilenkin92). We now show this may be translated to the general [[FQFT]] definition [above](#DefinitionGeneral) along the lines of ([Fiorenza-Valentino](#FiorenzaValentino), [FSS](#FSS)).
