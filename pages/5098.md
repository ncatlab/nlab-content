## Idea

The flavor of _[[modal logic]]_ called $K$ is [[propositional logic]] equipped with a single [[modality]] usually written "$\Box$" subject to the rules that for all [[propositions]] $p, q \colon Prop$ we have

* $\Box K \colon \Box(p \to q) \to (\Box p \to \Box q)$ ([[K modal logic]])

Often one adds to this the following further axioms

* $\Box T \colon \Box p \to p$ ([[T modal logic]])

* $\Box 4 \colon \Box p \to \Box \Box p$. ([[S4 modal logic]]).

$K$ is the basic [[epistemic logic]].  


## Properties

### Axiomatisation

* (Taut)  All (instances of ) propositional tautologies.

*   For each $i = 1,\ldots, m$, the axiom, ($K_i$):

$$(K_i\phi \wedge K_i(\phi \to \psi))\to K_i\psi.$$


### Derivation rules

* (MP) 

$$\frac{\phi \quad \phi\to \psi}{\psi} \quad$$

 (i.e. _modus ponens_);

* (Generalisation) 

$$\frac{\phi}{K_i\phi}.$$

The second deduction rule corresponds to the idea that _if a statement has been proved, then it is known to all 'agents'_.

### Normality

This logic is the smallest [[normal modal logic]].


## Semantics

The semantics of $K_{(m)}$ is just the Kripke semantics of this context, so a [[frame (modal logic)|frame]], $\mathfrak{F}$ is just a set, $W$  of possible worlds with $m$ relations $R_i$. A [[geometric models for modal logics|model]], $\mathfrak{M} = (\mathfrak{F},V)$, is a frame in that sense together with a valuation, $V: Prop \to \mathcal{P}(W)$, and the satisfaction relation is as described in [[geometric models for modal logics]] with just the difference implied by the fact that that page correspond to the use of $\Diamond_i = M_i$ whilst this uses $K_i$.  This means that 

* $\mathfrak{M},w \models K_i \phi$ if and only if, for all $v \in W$ such that $ R_i w v$, $\mathfrak{M},v \models \phi$.
