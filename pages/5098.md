##The epistemic logics $K$ and $K_{(m)}$##

This is the basic epistemic logic.  It is 'basic' with not much structure relating to any ideas of how 'knowledge' behaves.

($K$ is the usual notation for $K_{(1)}$.)

##Axiomatisation##

(A1)  All (instances of ) propositional tautologies.

(A2)  For each $i = 1,\ldots, m$, the axiom: 

$$(K_i\phi \wedge K_i(\phi \to \psi))\to K_i\psi.$$
