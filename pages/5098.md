##The epistemic logics $K$ and $K_{(m)}$##

This is the basic [[epistemic logic]].  It is 'basic' with not much structure relating to any ideas of how 'knowledge' behaves.

($K$ is the usual notation for $K_{(1)}$.)

##Axiomatisation##

* (Taut)  All (instances of ) propositional tautologies.

* (K)  For each $i = 1,\ldots, m$, the axiom: 

$$(K_i\phi \wedge K_i(\phi \to \psi))\to K_i\psi.$$

##Derivation rules##

* (MP) 

$$\frac{\phi \quad \phi\to \psi}{\psi} \quad$$

 (i.e. _modus ponens_);

* (Generalisation) 

$$\frac{\phi}{K_i\phi}.$$

The second deduction rule corresponds to the idea that if a statement has been proved, then it is known to all 'agents'.
