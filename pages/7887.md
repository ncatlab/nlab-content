## Idea

In models of [[homotopy theory]] by [[homotopical categories]] it is a common concept that [[morphisms]] may be replaced by [[fibrant resolutions]] or [[cofibrant resolutions]]. These are in general far from being unique. Moreover, generic ways of constructing them, notably via a [[small object argument]], yield resolutions which are "very large" in that they are [[relative cell complexes]] (or co-cell complexes, respectively) with large transfinite [[cardinality]] of the [[set]] of cell attachments.

In contrast, a _minimal (co-)fibration_ is one which is "as small as possible" in some precise sense. Typically this minimality is witnessed by the property that any [[weak equivalence]] between minimal (co-)fibrations is already an [[isomorphism]].

If one thinks of [[objects]] in the given [[homotopical category]] as "models" (namely as models for [[homotopy types]] as in the usage of "[[model category]]") then one often speaks of "minimal models". 

The discussion of the concept of minimal (co-)fibrations is often restricted to particular choices of ambient [[homotopical categories]] (see the list of [Examples](#Examples) below), prominent examples being the [[minimal Kan fibrations]] in the [[classical model structure on simplicial sets]] and the [[minimal Sullivan algebras]] in the [[projective model structure on dgc-algebras]]. A general concept of minimal models is considered in [Roig 93](#Roig93).
