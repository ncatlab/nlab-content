## Idea

The __complement__ $\tilde S$ of a [[subset]] $S$ of a [[set]] $X$ is the set of ell elements of $X$ not contained in $S$: 
$$
\tilde{S} = \{ a: X \;|\; a \notin S \}
.$$
(Besides $\tilde{S}$, there are many other notations, such as $X - S$, $X \setminus S$, $\bar{S}$, $S^c$, $\neg{S}$, and so forth.)

Notice that $S \cap \tilde{S} = \empty$, while $S \cup \tilde{S} = X$ by the principle of [[excluded middle]].  

A __complement__ of an element $S$ of a [[lattice]] is an element $T$ such that $S \wedge T = \bot$ and $S \vee T = \top$. Note that in general, complements need not be unique; for example, in the lattice of vector subspaces of a 2-dimensional [[vector space]] over a [[field]] $k$, a 1-dimensional subspace will have as many complements as there are elements of $k$. However, in some cases complements will be unique, for example in a [[distributive lattice]], in which case it is denoted $\tilde{S}$ (or $\neg S$, etc.). 

If every element has a complement, one speaks of a [[complemented lattice]]. Examples are [[Boolean algebras]], and in fact complemented distributive lattices are the same thing as Boolean algebras (in the sense that the [[category]] of Boolean algebras is [[equivalence|equivalent]] to the category of complemented distributive lattices). 

More generally, the __pseudocomplement__ of an element $S$ of a [[Heyting algebra]] is given by $\tilde{S} = S \Rightarrow \bot$.  This satisfies $S \wedge \tilde{S} = \bot$ but not $S \vee \tilde{S} = \top$ in general.  This case includes the complement of a subset even in [[constructive mathematics]].

In another direction, the __complement__ of a [[complemented subobject]] $S$ of an object $X$ in a [[coherent category]] is the unique subobject $\tilde{S}$ such that $S \cap \tilde{S}$ is the [[initial object]] and $S \cup \tilde{S} = X$.

The complement of a [[truth value]] (seen as a subset of the [[point]]) is called its _[[negation]]_.
