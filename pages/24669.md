## Statement

Consider the [[mapping space]] of those [[homeomorphisms]] from the [[closed ball]] $D^{n+1}$ to itself which restrict to the [[identity]] on the [[boundary]] [[n-sphere|$n$-sphere]].  What is known as *Alexander's trick* is a construction (due to [Alexander 1923](#Alexander23)) of an explicit deformation which witnesses that this space is [[connected topological space|connected]], hence that any two such homemorphisms are connected by an [[isotopy]].
