## Idea

An $n$-poset is any of several concepts that generalize [[partial order|posets]] in [[higher category theory]].  In fact, $n$-posets are the same as $(n-1,n)$-[[(n,r)-category|categories]].

## Definition

Fix a meaning of $\infty$-[[infinity-category|category]], however weak or strict you wish. Then an __$n$-poset__ is an $\infty$-category such that all [[parallel morphisms|parallel]] pairs of $j$-morphisms are [[equivalence|equivalent]] for $j \geq n$. Thus, up to equivalence, there is no point in mentioning anything beyond $n$-morphisms, not even whether two given parallel $n$-morphisms are equivalent. This definition makes sense as low as $n = -1$; the statement that parallel $(-1)$-morphisms are equivalent simply means that there exists an object (a $0$-morphism).

## Special cases
* The concept of $(-1)$-[[(-1)-poset|poset]] is trivial.
* A $0$-[[0-poset|poset]] is a [[truth value]].
* A $1$-[[1-poset|poset]] or [[(0,1)-category]] is simply a [[partial order|poset]].
* A $2$-[[2-poset|poset]] or [[(1,2)-category]] is a [[locally posetal 2-category]].
* In general, an $n$-poset is an $n$-[[n-category|category]] in which all parallel pairs of $n$-morphisms are equal.
* An $\infty$-poset is the same thing as an $\infty$-[[infinity-category|category]].

In the light of the general definition, one must interpret 'is' up to [[equivalence of categories]].  The last statement also depends on how strict your definition of $\infty$-category or $n$-category is; it is actually simpler to define $n$-posets from scratch as given above than to define them in terms of $n$-categories.

## Basic theorems

The $\infty$-category of ([[small category|small]]) $n$-posets, as a [[full subcategory|full sub-âˆž-category]] of the $\infty$-category of $\infty$-categories, is an $(n+1)$-poset.  That is, $n$-posets form an $(n+1)$-poset.  This is well known for small values of $n$.
