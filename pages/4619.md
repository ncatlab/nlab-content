## Definition 

Let $K$ be a [[field]]. A **Puiseux series** with [[coefficients]] in $K$ is a formal [[Laurent series]] 

$$f(t) = \sum_{k \geq m} a_k t^{k/r} \qquad (1)$$ 

where $r$ is a positive [[integer]], $m$ is an integer, and each $a_k$ belongs to $K$. Somewhat more abstractly but also more meaningfully, if $\mathbb{N}_{\cdot}$ is the [[poset]] of positive integers ordered by divisibility (so that $1$ is the least element), then the field of Puiseux series is the [[filtered colimit]] of the diagram of fields 

$$F: \mathbb{N}_{\cdot} \to Field$$ 

where each $F(n)$ is the field of [[Laurent series]] $K((t))$, but where $F(m) \to F(n)$ (in case $m|n$) is the field [[homomorphism]] taking $f(t)$ to $f(t^{n/m})$. 

The field of Puiseux series carries a [[valuation ring|valuation]] whose values are in the ordered group of [[rational number|rationals]] $(\mathbb{Q}, +)$: for $f(t)$ as in (1), $v(f)$ is the least exponent $k/r$ for which $a_k \neq 0$. 

## Puiseux-Newton expansions

Puiseux series were in essence considered by [[Isaac Newton]], who developed a method of expanding algebraic functions as Puiseux series, based on an analogue of [[Newton's method]] of approximating roots. Here is a sample theorem:

###### Theorem 
If $K$ is [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]] and has [[characteristic]] 0, then the field of Puiseux series over $K$ is the algebraic closure of the field of Laurent series over $K$.

###### Proof (sketch) 
It is enough to show that every degree $n$ extension $E$ of the field of Laurent series $K((x))$ is of the form $K((x^{1/n}))$. For this, it suffices that the integral closure $B$ of $K[ [x] ]$ in $E$ be of the form $K[ [x^{1/n}] ]$. 

Generally speaking, let $A$ be a complete DVR ([[valuation ring|discrete valuation ring]]) with maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}_A$ and residue class field $k_A$, and let $F$ be its field of fractions. Let $E$ be a degree $n$ extension of $F$, and let $B$ be the integral closure of $A$ in $E$. Then $B$ is also a complete DVR. We may write the ideal $\mathfrak{m}_A B$ of $B$ as $\mathfrak{m}_B^e$ where $e$ is the _ramification index_, and we have  

$$n = deg_F E = rank_A B = rank_{A/\mathfrak{m}_A} B/\mathfrak{m}_A B = dim_{k_A} B/\mathfrak{m}_B^e = e \cdot dim_{k_A} k_B$$ 

where the last equation holds because $\mathfrak{m}_B^i/\mathfrak{m}_B^{i+1} \cong k_B$ as $k_B$-modules and therefore also as $k_A$-modules. In the case $A = K[ [x] ]$ where $k_A = K$, we have that $dim_{k_A} k_B = 1$ since $K$ is algebraically closed, and therefore $e = n$. In other words, $(x)B = \mathfrak{m}_B^n$, so we can write $x = u \pi^n$ where $\pi$ generates the maximal ideal of $B$ and $u$ is a unit of $B$. 

The residue class $\bar{u} \in K$ has an $n^{th}$ root (again by algebraic closure); in fact a simple root since $char(K) = 0$. By [[Hensel's lemma]], this lifts to an $n^{th}$ root of $u$ in $B$. The element $u^{1/n} \pi$ is thus an $n^{th}$ root of $x$, and is a generator of the maximal ideal of $B$. Writing this element as $y = x^{1/n}$, the ring $K[ [y] ] = A[x^{1/n}] \hookrightarrow B$ is an $A$-submodule of full rank $n$ and integrally closed (being abstractly isomorphic to $A$, which is [[integral closure|integrally closed]] because it's a [[principal ideal domain]] and therefore a [[unique factorization domain]]), so that $K[ [y] ] = B$, as was to be shown.
