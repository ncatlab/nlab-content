# Adhesive categories

## Idea

An *adhesive category* is a [[category]] in which [[pushouts]] of [[monomorphisms]] exist and "behave more or less as they do in the category of [[Set|sets]]", or equivalently in any [[topos]].

## Definition

The following conditions on a category $C$ are equivalent.  When they are satisfied, we say that $C$ is **adhesive**.

1. $C$ has pullbacks and pushouts of monomorphisms, and pushout squares of monomorphisms are also pullback squares and are stable under pullback.

1. $C$ has pullbacks and pushouts of monomorphisms, and the latter are also [[2-colimit|(bicategorical)]] pushouts in the [[bicategory]] of [[spans]] in $C$.

1. $C$ has pullbacks and pushouts of monomorphisms, and admits a [[fully faithful functor|full embedding]] into a [[topos]] preserving pullbacks and pushouts of monomorphisms.

## Properties

* Any [[topos]] is adhesive.

* An adhesive category with a [[strict initial object]] is automatically an [[extensive category]].

## Related concepts

Adhesiveness is an [[exactness property]], similar to being a [[regular category]], an [[exact category]], or an [[extensive category]].  In particular, it can be phrased in the language of "lex colimits".
