## Idea

An *adhesive category* is a [[category]] in which [[pushouts]] of [[monomorphisms]] exist and "behave more or less as they do in the category of [[Set|sets]]", or equivalently in any [[topos]].

## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn}
###### Definition

The following conditions on a [[category]] $C$ are equivalent.  When they are satisfied, we say that $C$ is **adhesive**.

1. $C$ has [[pullbacks]] and [[pushouts]] of [[monomorphisms]], and pushout squares of monomorphisms are also pullback squares and are stable under pullback.

1. $C$ has pullbacks, and pushouts of monomorphisms, and the latter are also [[2-colimit|(bicategorical)]] pushouts in the [[bicategory]] of [[spans]] in $C$.

1. (If $C$ is small) $C$ has pullbacks and pushouts of monomorphisms, and admits a [[fully faithful functor|full embedding]] into a [[Grothendieck topos]] preserving pullbacks and pushouts of monomorphisms.

1. $C$ has pullbacks and pushouts of monomorphisms, and in any cubical diagram:

   ![cube](http://quicklatex.com/cache3/ql_af6fe9cbb3a7ee55b65eda25feb2062b_l3.png)

   if $X\to Y$ is a monomorphism, the bottom square is a pushout, and the left and back faces are pullbacks, then the top face is a pushout if and only if the front and right face are pullbacks.

## Properties

###### Proposition

In an adhesive category, the pushout of a monomorphism is again a monomorphism.

E.g. ([Lack, prop. 2.1](#Lack)) Notice that generally [[monomorphisms]] (as discussed there) are preserved by [[pullback]].

###### Proposition

An adhesive category with a [[strict initial object]] is automatically an [[extensive category]].

## Examples
 {#Examples}

* Any [[topos]] is adhesive.  For [[Grothendieck toposes]] this is easy, because $Set$ is adhesive and adhesivity is a condition on colimits and finite limits, hence preserved by functor categories and left-exact localizations.  For [[elementary toposes]] it is a theorem of [Lack and Sobocinski](#LackSobocinski).

* The fact that monomorphisms are stable under pushouts in toposes plays a central role for [[Cisinski model structures]] such as notably the standard [[model structure on simplicial sets]], where the monomorphisms are [[cofibrations]] and as such required to be closed under pushout (in particular).



## Related concepts

Adhesiveness is an [[exactness property]], similar to being a [[regular category]], an [[exact category]], or an [[extensive category]].  In particular, it can be phrased in the language of "lex colimits".
