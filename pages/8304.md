There are several notions of abelianizations for various algebraic structures. There is also the [[Verdier's abelianization functor]] from triangulated to an abelian category with some universal property; this is treated in a separate entry.  

## Definition

+-- {: .num_defn }
###### Definition

For $G$ a [[group]], its **abelianization** $G^{ab} \in $ [[Grp]] is the [[quotient]] of $G$ by its [[commutator subgroup]]:

$$
  G^{ab} \coloneqq G/[G,G]
  \,,
$$

The abelianization is an [[abelian group]]. Indeed, it is the [[universal construction|universal]] abelian group induced by $G$, in the following sense:

###### Proposition

Abelianization extends to a [[functor]] $(-)^{ab} \colon $ [[Grp]] $\to$ [[Ab]] and this functor is [[left adjoint]] to the [[forgetful functor]] $U \colon Ab \to Grp$ from abelian groups to group.

Hence abelianization is the _[[free construction]]_ of an abelian group from a group.

## Examples

### Free groups

A [[free abelian group]] on a set $S$ is the abelianization of the [[free group]] on $S$.

In other words, if $F \colon Set \to Grp$ is the [[free group]]-functor and $F_{Ab} \colon Set \to Ab$ is the [[free abelian group]] functor, then 

$$
  \array{
    Set &&\stackrel{F_{ab}}{\to}&& Ab
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{F_{grp}}}\searrow && \nearrow_{\mathrlap{(-)^{ab}}}
    \\
    && Grp
  }
$$ 

commutes up to isomorphism. This is because we have a corresponding commutative diagram of forgetful functors 

$$
  \array{
    Set &&\stackrel{U_{ab}}{\leftarrow}&& Ab
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{U_{grp}}}\nwarrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{U}}
    \\
    && Grp
  }
$$ 

and $(-)^{ab} \circ F_{grp}$ is left adjoint to $U_{grp} \circ U$.
