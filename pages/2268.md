
Let $X$ by a differentiable [[manifold]]. The _tangent Lie algebroid_ $T X$ of $X$ is the [[Lie algebroid]] that corresponds -- in the sense of  [[Lie theory]] -- to 

* the [[codiscrete groupoid]] $X \times X$ of $X$. 

* the [[fundamental groupoid]] $\Pi_1(X)$ of $X$. 

When the tangent Lie algebroid is regarded as a [[Lie ∞-algebroid]] it corresponds to

* the [[path ∞-groupoid]] $\Pi_\infty(X)$.

The space of objects of $T X$ is $X$ itself and its elements in degree 1 are the vectors on $X$, i.e. the elements in the [[tangent bundle]] of $X$. These are to be thouhght of as the [[infinitesimal space|infintiesimal]] paths in $X$.

So to some extent the tangent Lie algebroid _is_ the [[tangent bundle]] $T X$ of $X$. More precisely, when using the definition of a [[Lie algebroid]] $E$ over $X$ as a diagram

$$
  \array{
    E &&\stackrel{\rho}{\to}&& T X
    \\
    & \searrow && \swarrow
    \\
    && X
  }
$$

where $\rho$ is the map called the _anchor map_, the tangent Lie algebroid is that whose anchor map is the identity map

$$
  \array{
    E = T X &&\stackrel{\rho = Id}{\to}&& T X
    \\
    & \searrow && \swarrow
    \\
    && X
  }
  \,.
$$

Therefore the tangent Lie algebroid of $X$ is usually denoted $T X$, just as the [[tangent bundle]] itself.

The [[Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra]] of $T X$ is correspondingly fundamental: it is the [[deRham dg-algebra]] of [[differential form]]s on $X$:

$$
  CE(T X) = (\Omega^\bullet(X), d_{dR})
  \,.
$$

## relation to flat $\infty$-Lie algebroid valued differential forms ##

For $\mathfral{a}$ any other [[Lie algebroid]] or [[Lie infinity-algebroid]], a morphism of [[Lie infinity-algebroid]]s 

$$
  \omega : T X \to \mathfrak{a}
$$

is _flat $\mathfrak{a}$-valued [[differential form]] datum_ .

For instance if $\mathfrak{a} = \mathfrak{g}$ is an ordinary [[Lie algebra]] then a morphism $T X \to \mathfrak{g}$ is a flat Lie algebra valued differential form on $X$, i.e. an element $A \in \Omega^1(X) \otimes \mathfrak{g}$ such that $d A + [-,-](A \wedge A) = 0$.

If $\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{u}(1) = \mathbb{R}$ is the abelian 1-dimensional Lie algebra, then a morphism $T X \to \mathfrak{g}$ is just a closed [[differential form|differential 1-form]] on $X$.

More on $\infty$-Lie algebroid-valued differential forms is (eventually) at [[schreiber:∞-Lie algebroid valued differential forms]].
