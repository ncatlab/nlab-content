A [[topos]] can be considered a symmetric monoidal category with respect to the cartesian product. Thus the notion of a unital [[ring]], and commutative unital ring can be defined in that monoidal category.  

A **ringed topos** is a topos $X$ with a distinguished unital ring $\mathcal{O}$ in $X$, usually, but not necessarily commutative.

J. Lurie is also making a modern exposition of this notion along with $(\infty,1)$-version; see also HAG and DAG by Toen et al.
