## Statement

+-- {: .num_prop #SchemesAreSober}
###### Proposition

The [[topological space]] underlying a [[scheme]] is a [[sober topological space]]. In particular for [[affine schemes]]: The [[Zariski topology]] on the [[prime spectrum of a commutative ring]] is sober. 

=--

For **proof** see [this prop](Zariski+topology#ZariskiTopologyIsSober) at _[[Zariski topology]]_.

###### Remark

If instead of the [[prime spectrum of a commutative ring]] one considers only the [[topological subspace]] of [[maximal ideals]] in prop. \ref{SchemesAreSober}, as in [[algebraic geometry]] before the introduction of [[schemes]] by [[Alexander Grothendieck]], then one does not get a sober space. But if the ring is a [[Jacobson ring]] (in that every [[prime ideal]] in the ring is an [[intersection]] of [[maximal ideals]]), then the [soberification](sober+topological+space#Reflection) of the [[topological subspace]] of maximal ideals inside the prime ideals is the full prime spectrum.
