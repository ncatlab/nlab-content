## Statement

The [[topological space]] underlying a [[scheme]] is a [[sober topological space]]. In particular locally the [[Zariski topology]] on the [[prime spectrum of a commutative ring]] is sober. _For details see [this prop](Zariski+topology#ZariskiTopologyIsSober).

If instead of the [[prime spectrum of a commutative ring]] one considers only the [[topological subspace]] of [[maximal ideals]], as in algebraic geometry before the introduction of schemes, then one does not get a sober space.
But if the ring is a [[Jacobson ring]] (any prime ideal is an intersection of maximal ideals), then the [[soberification]] of this subspace is the prime spectrum.
