George Boole (2 November 1815 – 8 December 1864) was a mathematician and logician, who was the first professor of mathematics at the then Queen's College Cork in Ireland (now Univerity College Cork, (UCC)). He is best known mathematically for his work on algebraic logic which led to the development of Boolean algebras. His work is often cited as being one of the first steps towards the invention of computers.
