## Idea

The notion of *composition rings* is an abstraction of the [[structure]] present in a [[ring of functions]] from the [[ground ring]] to itself: In addition to (pointwise) [[addition]] and [[multiplication]], there is a compatible operation of *[[composition]]*.

## Definition 

A *composition ring* is a [[commutative ring]] $R$ equipped with an operation 
$$(-)\circ(-) \colonR \times R \to R$$ 
such that for all [[elements]] $f \in R$, $g \in R$, and $h \in R$, we have:

1. $(f + g) \circ h = (f \circ h) + (g \circ h)$,

1. $(f \cdot g) \circ h = (f \circ h) \cdot (g \circ h)$,

1. $f \circ (g \circ h) = (f \circ g) \circ h$
  
   ([[associativity]] of composition).


## Examples

* The [[function algebra]] on a [[commutative ring]] is a composition ring, with "$\circ$" being the [[composition]] of functions.

* In particular, every [[polynomial ring]] is a composition ring with "$\circ$" being the actual [[composition]] of polynomials regarded as [[functions]] from the [[ground ring]] to itself.

* Every commutative ring becomes a composition ring by setting $f \circ g \coloneqq f$.
