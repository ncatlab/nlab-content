## Idea

The **(co)bordism ring** $\Omega_*=\oplus_{n\geq 0}\Omega_n$ is the [[graded ring]] whose 

* degree $n$ elements are classes of $n$-[[dimension|dimensional]] [[smooth manifolds]] modulo [[cobordism]];

* product operation is given by the [[Cartesian product]] of manifolds;

* addition operation is given by the [[disjoint union]] of manifolds.

Instead of bare manifolds one may consider manifolds with extra structure, such as [[orientation]], [[spin structure]], [[string structure]], etc. and accordingly there is 

* the _oriented cobordism ring_ $\Omega^{SO}_*$,  

* the _spin cobordism ring_ $\Omega^{Spin}_*$, 

etc. 

In this general context the bare cobordism ring is also denoted $\Omega^O_*$ or $\Omega^{un}_*$, for emphasis.

A ring [[homomorphism]] out of the cobordism ring is a (multiplicative) _[[genus]]_.

More generally, for $X$ a fixed [[manifold]] there is a relative cobordism ring $\Omega_\bullet(X)$ whose 

* elements are classes modulo cobordism over $X$ of manifolds equipped with [[continuous functions]] to $X$ ("singular manifolds");

* multiplication of $[f_1 \colon \Sigma_1 \to X]$ with $[f_2 \colon \Sigma_2 \to X]$ is given by _transversal intersection_ $\Sigma_1 \cap_X \Sigma_2$ over $X$: perturb $f_1$ such $(f_1',f_2)$ becomes a [[transversal maps]] and then form the [[pullback]] $\Sigma_1 \times_{(f_1',f_2)} \Sigma_2$ in [[Diff]].

This product is graded in that it satisfies the **dimension formula**

$$
  (dim X - dim \Sigma_1) + (dim X - dim \Sigma_2) = dim X - dim (\Sigma_1 \cap_X \Sigma_2)
$$

hence

$$
  dim (\Sigma_1 \cap_X \Sigma_2 ) = (dim \Sigma_1 + dim \Sigma_2) - dim X
  \,.
$$

Still more generally, this may be considered for $\Sigma$ being [[manifolds with boundary]]. Then $\Omega(X,A)$ for $(X,A)$ a [[CW pair]] is the ring of cobordism classes, relative boundary, of singular manifolds $\Sigma \to X$ such that the [[boundary]] of $\Sigma$ lands in in $A$.

The resulting [[functor]]

$$
  (X,A) \mapsto \Omega^G_\bullet(X,A)
$$

constitutes a [[generalized homology theory]] (see e.g. [Buchstaber, II.8](#Buchstaber)). Accordingly this is called _[[bordism homology theory]]_.

The [[spectrum]] that represents this under the [[Brown representability theorem]] is the universal [[Thom spectra]] $M G$ (e.g. [[MO]] for $G=O$ or [[MU]] for $G = U$), which canonically is a [[ring spectrum]] under [[Whitney sum]] of [[universal vector bundles]]. Accordingly the (co-bordism ring) itself is equivalently the bordism homology groups of the point, hence the [[stable homotopy groups]] of the [[Thom spectrum]] (this is _[[Thom's theorem]]_)

$$
  \Omega_\bullet^G \simeq \M G_\bullet(\ast) \simeq pi_\bullet(M G)
  \,.
$$

This remarkable relation between [[manifolds]] and [[stable homotopy theory]] is known as _[[cobordism theory]]_ (or "Thom theory").

On general grounds this is equivalently the $M G$-[[generalized cohomology]] of the point ([[cobordism cohomology theory]])

$$
  \Omega_\bullet^G \simeq M G^\bullet(\ast)
$$

which justifies calling $\Omega_\bullet^G$ both the "bordism ring" as well as the "cobordism ring".

## Properties

### Relation to cohomotopy
 {#RelationToCohomotopy}

Let $X$ be a [[smooth manifold]] of [[dimension]] $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and let $k \leq n$. Then the [[Pontryagin-Thom construction]] induces a [[bijection]]

$$
  [X, S^k]
  \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  \Omega^{n-k}(X)
$$

from the [[cohomotopy]] sets of $X$ to the [[cobordism group]] of $(n-k)$-dimensional [[submanifolds]] with [[normal bundle|normal]] [[framed manifold|framing]] up to normally framed [[cobordism]].

In particular, the natural group structure on [[cobordism group]] (essentially given by [[disjoint union]] of submanifolds) this way induces a group structure on the cohomotopy sets.

This is made explicit for instance in [Kosinski 93, chapter IX](#Kosinski93).



## Examples

### Framed cobordism
 {#FramedCobordism}

By [[Thom's theorem]], for any [[(B,f)-structure]] $\mathcal{B}$, there is an [[isomorphism]] (of [[commutative rings]])

$$
  \Omega^{\mathcal{B}}_\bullet
  \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  \pi_\bullet(M\mathcal{B})
$$

from the [[cobordism ring]] of manifolds with stable normal $\mathcal{B}$-structure to the [[homotopy groups of a spectrum|homotopy groups]] of the universal $\mathcal{B}$-[[Thom spectrum]]. 

Now for $\mathcal{B} = Fr$ [[framing]] structure, then 

$$
  M Fr \simeq \mathbb{S}
$$

is equivalently the [[sphere spectrum]]. Hence in this case [[Thom's theorem]] states that there is an isomorphism

$$
  \Omega^{fr}_\bullet
  \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  \pi_\bullet(\mathbb{S})
$$

between the framed cobordism ring and the [[stable homotopy groups of spheres]].

For discussion of computation of $\pi_\bullet(\mathbb{S})$ this way, see for instance ([Wang-Xu 10, section 2](#WangXu10)).

For instance 

* $\Omega^{fr}_0 = \mathbb{Z}$ because there are two $k$-framings on a single point, corresponding to $\pi_0(O(k)) \simeq \mathbb{Z}_2$, the negative of a point with one framing is the point with the other framing, and so under disjoint union, the framed points form the group of integers;

* $\Omega^{fr}_1 = \mathbb{Z}_2$ because the only compact connected 1-manifold is the circle, there are two framings on the circle, corresponding to $\pi_1(O(k)) \simeq \mathbb{Z}_2$ and they are their own negatives.

###### Proposition

For $X$ a [[CW-complex]] (for instance a [[manifold]]), then  the oriented cobordism ring is expressed in terms of the [[ordinary homology]] $H_q(X,\Omega^{SO}_{p-q})$ of $X$ with [[coefficients]] in the cobordism ring over the point, prop. \ref{OrientedCobordismOverPoint}, as

$$
  \Omega_p^{SO}(X)
  =
  \oplus_{q = 0}^p
  H_q(X,\Omega_{p-q}^{SO})
  \;
  mod\; odd \; torsion
  \,.
