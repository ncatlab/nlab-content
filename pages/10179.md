## Idea

Every [[topos]] $\mathbf{H}$ is canonically a [[cartesian monoidal category]] $(\mathbf{H}, \times)$, with the [[tensor product]] being the [[cartesian product]]. If in addition to this canonical product $\mathbf{H}$ is equipped with _another_ noncartesian [[monoidal category]] structure $\otimes$, then $(\mathbf{H}, \otimes)$ might be called a _monoidal topos_. 

Of course, a topos may carry more than one non-cartesian monoidal category structure, and in some of the interesting examples, the various monoidal structures will be interlinked in some way. A typical example is the phenomenon of [[plethysm]]. 

## Examples

+-- {: .num_example}
###### Example

For $(\mathcal{C}, \otimes)$ a small [[monoidal category]], the [[presheaf topos]] $[\mathcal{C}, Set]$ is naturally a monoidal topos with respect to the [[Day convolution]] tensor product.

###### Example


For $\mathbf{H}$ a [[topos]] and $\mathbb{G} \in \mathbf{H}$ a [[monoid object]], the [[slice topos]]  $\mathbf{H}_{/\mathbb{G}}$ inherits a non-cartesian monoidal structure $\otimes_G$ induced from the product structure on $\mathbb{G}$:

$$
  \left[
    \array{
      X_1
      \\
      \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\chi_1}}
      \\
      \mathbb{G}
   }
  \right]
  \otimes_{\mathbb{G}}
  \left[
    \array{
      X_2
      \\
      \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\chi_2}}
      \\
      \mathbb{G}
   }
  \right]
  \;\;
  \coloneqq
  \;\;
  \left[
    \array{
      X_1 \times X_2
      \\
      \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(\chi_1, \chi_2)}}
      \\
      \mathbb{G} \times \mathbb{G}
      \\
      \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\cdot}}
      \\
      \mathbb{G}
    }
  \right]
  \,.
$$

Such monoidal toposes appear as categories of [[local action functionals]] in the context of _[[motivic quantization]]_.

###### Example

The [[classifying topos for the theory of objects]] which is the [[presheaf topos]] $[FinSet, Set]$ on the [[opposite category]] of [[FinSet]] or equivalently the category of [[finitary monad|finitary]] [[endofunctors]] $End_f(Set)$ is naturally a monoidal topos under [[composition]] of endofunctors. A standard textbook reference is ([Johnstone D3.2](#Johnstone)). The [[enriched category theory]] over this monoidal category is discussed in ([Garner 13](#Garner13)).

###### Example 
There are several variations on the theme of the previous example, where one considers presheaves on the "$\underline{\;\;\;\;\;}$" monoidal category $M$ generated by a single object, where the "blank" may be filled in with some structure-connoting adjective. In the previous example, we had that $FinSet^{op}$ is the free [[cartesian monoidal category]] generated by a single object, but the blank might be filled in with "symmetric" ($M$ is the permutation category $\mathbb{P}$), or "braided" (the braid category $\mathbb{B}$), or "semicartesian symmetric monoidal" ($Fin_{inj}$: finite sets and injections between them), or "strict" (the discrete category $\mathbb{N}$), and so on. In each of these cases, the presheaf topos $E = [M^{op}, Set]$ acquires a Day convolution structure, but more interestingly, we have an equivalence 

$$E \simeq \{E, E\}$$ 

where the right side is the category of cocontinuous $\underline{\;\;\;\;\;}$ monoidal endofunctors. By transferring the endofunctor composition across the equivalence, $E$ acquires another monoidal product structure. In the classical symmetric case, this goes under names like [[plethysm|plethystic monoidal product]], and in each such case the notion of monoid therein gives a notion of [[operad]]. See also [[generalized multicategory]].

###### Example

The category of [[dendroidal sets]] is a topos (the [[presheaf topos]] on the [[tree category]]) and naturally carries the non-cartesian [[Boardman-Vogt tensor product]].

###### Example

In ([Dolan 11](#Dolan11)) is indicated a category of "toric [[quasicoherent sheaves]]" which is a topos and hence under tensor product of quansicoherent sheaves a (semi?)-monoidal topos.
