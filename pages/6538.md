__Quantum group Fourier transform__ refers to several variants of Fourier transforms attached to Hopf algebras or their analytic versions. 

The usual Fourier transform is between functions on locally compact abelian group $G$ and functions on its [[Pontrjagin dual]] locally compact abelian group $\hat{G}$ (the group of continuous characters on $G$ with the topology of uniform convergence on compact sets), cf. wikipedia, [Pontrjagin duality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontryagin_duality). 

In noncommutative case, the role of Pontrjagin duality is played by a version of [[Tannaka-Krein theorem|Tannaka-Krein duality]]. 

To avoid analytic details for starters, and still to introduce elements of the general story, one can look at the case when $G$ is finite. Then, over a field $k$, the group Hopf algebra $k \hat{G}$ is isomorphic with the [[dual Hopf algebra]] $(k G)^*$ of the group Hopf algebra $k G$ which is itself isomorphic as a Hopf algebra to the function algebra $k(G)$. The composition is giving the Fourier transform $k \hat{G}\cong k(G)$, which is a linear map from the convolution algebra of $G$ to the function algebra on $G$. In such a situation one has a discrete version of Haar measure. Define 

$$
\mathcal{F}(h)(u) := \sum_{\chi\in \hat{G}} h (\chi)\chi(u)
$$
$$
\mathcal{F}^{-1}(\phi)(\chi) := \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{u\in G}\chi(u^{-1})\phi(u)
$$
$$
\Lambda = \sum_{u\in G} u \in k G
$$
$$
\Lambda^* = \sum_{\chi} \chi
$$

where one assumes that $|G|$ is invertible in $k$. It holds that

$\chi \Lambda^* = \epsilon(\chi)\Lambda^*$ for all $\chi\in k \hat{G}$ and $\Lambda \phi = \Lambda \epsilon(\phi)$ for all $\phi\in k G$. In other words, $\Lambda$ is a right integral _in_ $k G$ and $\Lambda^*$ is a left integral in $(k G)^*$. 

One can write 

$$
\mathcal{F}(h) = \Lambda_{(1)}\langle h, \Lambda_{(2)}\rangle, 
$$
for $h\in k \hat{G} = (k G)^*$ (notice the usage of left [[coregular action]]) and

$$
\mathcal{F}^{-1}(\phi) = \frac{\Lambda^*_{(1)}\langle \Lambda^*_{(2)},S \phi\rangle}{\langle \Lambda^*, \Lambda \rangle}
$$

for $\phi\in k G$ and where $S: k G\to (k G)^{op,cop}$ is the antipode.
These formulas make sense for more general [[dual bialgebra|Hopf algebras in duality]] provided there are appropriate analogues of $\Lambda$ and $\Lambda^*$ and $\langle \Lambda^*, \Lambda\rangle$ is invertible in $k$. That generalization is called the __quantum group Fourier transform__. 


They can also be related to the __fundamental operator__ in Hopf algebra $H$, which is the invertible operator $W : H\otimes H \to H\otimes H$ satisfying the pentagon identity

$$
W_{1 2} W_{1 3} W_{2 3} = W_{2 3} W_{1 2}
$$
in  the tensor cube of the space of linear endomorphisms of $H$ and such that

$$
\Delta(h) = W (h\otimes 1) W^{-1} 
$$ 

$$
S h = (\epsilon\otimes id)\circ W^{-1}(h\otimes - )
$$

for all $h\in H$. For finite-dimensional Hopf algebras $W(g\otimes h) = g_{(1)}\otimes g_{(2)} h$ and $W^{-1}(g\otimes h = g_{(1)}\otimes (S g_{(2)}) h$.
