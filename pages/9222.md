## Idea

A _density_ on a [[manifold]] of [[dimension]] $n$ is a function that to each point assigns a notion of [[volume]] (in general signed, and possibly degenerate) of $n$-[[hypercubes]].  A positive definite density is equivalently a _[[volume element]]_ (or a volume form on an [[orientation|oriented]] manifold).


## Definition

For $X$ a [[manifold]] its **density bundle** is the  real [[line bundle]] [[associated bundle|associated]] to the [[principal bundle]] underlying the [[tangent bundle]] by the 1-dimensional [[representation]] of the [[general linear group]] given by the [[determinant]] [[homomorphism]]

$$
  det \;\colon\; GL(n) \to GL(1) \simeq Aut_{Vect}(\mathbb{R}^1)
  \,.
$$

A [[section]] of the density bundle on $X$ is called a _density on $X$_. 

This is the general object again which one has [[integration]] of functions on $X$.

More generally, for $s \in \mathbb{R} - \{0\}$ an **$s$-density** is a section of the [[line bundle]] which is [[associated bundle|associated]] via the [[determinant]] to the power of $s$:

$$
  det^{s} \;\colon \; GL(n) \to GL(1) \simeq Aut_{Vect}(\mathbb{R}^1)
  \,.
$$

The parameter $s$ is called the __weight__ of the density.  In particular for $s = 1/2$ one speaks of **half-densities**.


## Physical interpretation

We earlier spoke of a density (of weight $1$) $\rho$ as a measure of [[volume]], but in application to [[physics]] a density on [[spacetime]] (or space) might as easily be a measure of some other [[extensive quantity]] $Q$ (say, [[mass]]).  We then call $\rho$ the __$Q$-density__ (say, _mass density_); the [[integration of differential forms|integral]] of $\rho$ over a region $R$ is the amount of $Q$ in $R$.

Relative to a nondegenerate notion of volume given by another density $vol$, the ratio $\rho/vol$ is a [[scalar field]], an [[intensive quantity]] which is often also referred to as the _density_.  But $\rho$ itself is more fundamental in the [[geometry of physics]].
