## Idea

A _density_ on a [[manifold]] of [[dimension]] $n$ is a function that to each point assigns a notion of [[volume]] of $n$-[[hypercubes]]. After a choice of [[orientation]] (if one exists) a density is equivalently a _[[volume form]]_.


## Definition

For $X$ a [[manifold]] its **density bundle** is the  real [[line bundle]] [[associated bundle|associated]] to the [[principal bundle]] underlying the [[tangent bundle]] by the 1-dimensional [[representation]] of the [[general linear group]] given by the [[determinant]] [[homomorphism]]

$$
  det \;\colon\; GL(n) \to GL(1) \simeq Aut_{Vect}(\mathbb{R}^1)
  \,.
$$

A [[section]] of the density bundle on $X$ is called a _density on $X$_. 

This is the general object again which one has [[integration]] of functions on $X$.

More generally, for $s \in \mathbb{R} - \{0\}$ an **$s$-density** is a section of the [[line bundle]] which is [[associated bundle|associated]] via the [[determinant]] to the power of $s$:

$$
  det^{s} \;\colon \; GL(n) \to GL(1) \simeq Aut_{Vect}(\mathbb{R}^1)
  \,.
$$

In particular for $s = 1/2$ one speaks of **half-densities**.
