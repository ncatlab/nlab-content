The famous _finale_ from this lecture, in English translation:

> The  instrument  that  mediates  between  theory  and  practice,  between  thought  and observation, is [[mathematics]];  it builds the connecting bridge and makes it stronger and stronger.  Thus it happens that our entire 
present-day culture, insofar as it rests on intellectual insight into and harnessing of nature, is founded on mathematics.  Already, [[Galilei|GALILEO]] said:  Only he can understand nature who has learned the language and signs
by which it speaks to us;  but this language is mathematics and its signs are mathematical figures.  [[Kant|KANT]] declared, “I maintain that in each 
particular natural science there is only as much true science as there is mathematics.”  In fact, we do not master a theory in natural science until we have extracted its  mathematical kernel and laid it completely bare.  Without mathematics today’s astronomy  and physics would be impossible;  in their theoretical parts, these sciences unfold directly into mathematics.  These, like numerous other applications, give mathematics whatever authority it enjoys with the general public. 

> Nevertheless, all mathematicians have refused to let applications serve as the standard of value for mathematics.  [[Gauss|GAUSS]] spoke of the magical attraction that made number theory the favorite science for the first mathematicians, not to mention its inexhaustible richness,  in  which  it  so  far  surpasses  all  other  parts  of  mathematics. [[Leopold Kronecker|KRONECKER]] compared number theorists with the Lotus Eaters, who, once they had sampled that delicacy, could never do without it.

> With  astonishing  sharpness,  the  great  mathematician  [[Henri Poincaré|POINCARÉ]] once  attacked TOLSTOY, who had suggested that pursuing “science for science’s sake” is foolish.  The achievements of industry, for example, would never have seen the light of day had the practical-minded existed alone and had not these advances been pursued by disinterested fools.

> The glory of the human spirit, so said the famous Königsberg mathematician JACOBI, is the single purpose of all science

> We must not believe those, who today with philosophical bearing and a tone  of superiority prophesy the downfall of culture and accept the [ignorabimus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignoramus_et_ignorabimus).  For us there is no  [ignorabimus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignoramus_et_ignorabimus), and in my opinion even none whatever in natural science. In place of the foolish [ignorabimus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignoramus_et_ignorabimus) let stand our slogan:

> We  must know,

> We will know.

  > [[natural philosophy|Philosophy]] $[$i.e. [[physics]] $]$ is written in this grand book &#8212; I mean the universe &#8212; which stands continually open to our gaze, but it cannot be understood unless one first learns to comprehend the language and interpret the characters in which it is written. It is written in the language of [[mathematics]], and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometrical figures, without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it; without these, one is wandering around in a dark labyrinth.
