## Definition

In an [[(∞,1)-topos]] an morphism $f \colon X \to Y$ is an _$n$-epimorphism_ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ equivalently if 

* in its [[n-image]] factorization 

  $$
    f \colon X \to im_n(f) \to Y
  $$

  the second morphism is an [[equivalence in an (∞,1)-category]];

* it is an [[n-connected|(n-2)-connected]] object in the [[slice (∞,1)-topos]] $\mathbf{H}_{/Y}$. 

## Properties

The $n$-epimorphisms in an [[(∞,1)-topos]] are the left half of the [[(n-epi, n-mono) factorization system|((n-2)-epi, (n-2)-mono) factorization system]] which factors every morphism through its [[n-image]].

## Examples

* The $\infty$-epimorphisms are precisely the [[equivalences]].

* The 1-epimorphism are the [[effective epimorphisms in an (∞,1)-category|effective epimorphisms]].

* Every morphism is a $0$-epimorphism.

* The 1-epimorphisms between [[0-truncated]] objects are precisely the ordinary [[epimorphisms]] in the underlying [[1-topos]].
